Ground Truth Answer: choose 100 50 * 2^98
Proposed Answer: 2^50 * 50!
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting the number of injective functions from Fin 100 to Fin 2 × Fin 50 with specific constraints:
   - The function must be injective
   - For every non-zero index i, there must exist a previous index j where:
     * The first components match (f j).1 = (f i).1
     * The second components are consecutive numbers

2. The ground truth answer is "choose 100 50 * 2^98":
   - This suggests selecting 50 positions out of 100 for one color (Fin 2 component)
   - The remaining 50 positions get the other color
   - The 2^98 term handles the consecutive constraints

3. The proposed answer is "2^50 * 50!":
   - This suggests 2 choices for each of 50 elements (but doesn't match the problem's structure)
   - The 50! term suggests permutations, but doesn't account for the consecutive constraints

The two answers are clearly different in form and don't appear to represent equivalent counting methods. The proposed answer doesn't seem to correctly model the problem's constraints.
