Ground Truth Answer: {fun x => 2 * x}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ k > 0, ∀ x, f x = k * x}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is close but not exactly equivalent to the ground truth. The ground truth specifies exactly the function f(x) = 2x, while the proposed answer allows for any positive linear function f(x) = kx where k > 0. The problem's functional equation actually only holds when k=2, as can be verified by substitution. Therefore, the proposed answer is too general and includes incorrect solutions.
