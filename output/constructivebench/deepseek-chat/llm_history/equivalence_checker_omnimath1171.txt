Ground Truth Answer: 725
Proposed Answer: (26 * 28 - 3)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem gives us two equations:
   - a + b + c = 26
   - 1/a + 1/b + 1/c = 28

2. We need to find the value of the symmetric expression:
   a/b + b/c + c/a + a/c + c/b + b/a

3. The ground truth answer is 725.

4. The proposed answer suggests it's (26*28 - 3) = 728 - 3 = 725.

Let's verify the proposed solution:

The expression can be rewritten as:
(a/b + b/a) + (b/c + c/b) + (a/c + c/a)

Each pair (x/y + y/x) can be expressed as (x² + y²)/(xy) = (x+y)²/(xy) - 2

However, a more straightforward approach is to multiply the two given equations:
(a+b+c)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) = 26*28 = 728

Expanding the left side gives:
3 + (a/b + b/a) + (a/c + c/a) + (b/c + c/b) = 728

Which is exactly:
3 + (our desired expression) = 728

Therefore, our desired expression = 728 - 3 = 725

The proposed answer (26*28 - 3) correctly calculates to 725 and matches the ground truth.
