Looking at the pattern of repeated digit sum operations (fn) applied to a large power of 2, we observe that repeatedly taking digit sums eventually leads to a single-digit number. For powers of 2, this stabilizes at 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, or 8 in a cycle. Since 1990 ≡ 1 mod 6, 2^1990's digit sum converges to 2. Then f1 squares this to get 4.
