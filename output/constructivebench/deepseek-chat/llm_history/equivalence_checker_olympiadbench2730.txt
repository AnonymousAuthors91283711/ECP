Ground Truth Answer: fun T => (T - 13) * (30 - 16) / (20 - 13) + 16
Proposed Answer: fun T => (T - 7) * 2 + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes an arithmetic sequence where:
   - aₙ = a₁ + (n-1)*d
   - a₁₆ = 13
   - a₃₀ = 20

2. The ground truth answer correctly solves for k in terms of T by:
   - Calculating the common difference d = (20-13)/(30-16) = 7/14 = 0.5
   - Then solving the equation T = 13 + (k-16)*0.5 for k
   - Which gives k = (T-13)*2 + 16

3. The proposed answer is: k = (T-7)*2 + 1

Comparing the two:
- The ground truth simplifies to k = 2T - 26 + 16 = 2T - 10
- The proposed answer simplifies to k = 2T - 14 + 1 = 2T - 13

These are clearly different linear functions (different slopes and intercepts), so they cannot be equivalent.
