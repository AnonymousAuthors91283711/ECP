Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a function N(t,a) = a / 2^(t/6)
2. We're given initial conditions A0 = 2*B0 and N(24,A0) = N(24,B0)
3. We need to find t where N(t,B0) = B0/2

The ground truth answer is 8, while the proposed answer is 6.

Let's verify:
N(t,B0) = B0 / 2^(t/6) = B0/2
This simplifies to: 2^(t/6) = 2
Which gives: t/6 = 1 → t = 6

The proposed answer 6 is actually correct, while the ground truth answer 8 appears to be incorrect. The calculation clearly shows t should be 6 to satisfy the equation.
