Ground Truth Answer: (7, 1, 5, 2)
Proposed Answer: (1, 3, 5, 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for natural numbers a, b, c, d such that the sum of absolute values of roots of the given polynomial can be expressed as (a + b√c)/d, with certain constraints on c and coprimality conditions.

2. The ground truth answer is (7, 1, 5, 2), which would give the expression (7 + 1√5)/2.

3. The proposed answer is (1, 3, 5, 2), which would give the expression (1 + 3√5)/2.

4. Let's evaluate both expressions:
   - Ground truth: (7 + √5)/2 ≈ (7 + 2.236)/2 ≈ 4.618
   - Proposed: (1 + 3√5)/2 ≈ (1 + 6.708)/2 ≈ 3.854

5. The actual sum of absolute values of roots for this polynomial is approximately 4.618 (the ground truth value), not 3.854.

6. The proposed answer satisfies the constraints (Squarefree c, Coprime conditions), but gives a different numerical value.
