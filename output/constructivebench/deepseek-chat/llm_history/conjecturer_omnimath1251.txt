<<<8! * 8! / (4! * 4!)>>> 

Explanation: The problem counts 8x8 grid subsets forming a permutation with equal even/odd sum diagonals. The first two conditions enforce permutation constraints (8! each), while the last two require equal partitioning of sums (central binomial coefficient 8 choose 4). The answer combines these multiplicatively.
