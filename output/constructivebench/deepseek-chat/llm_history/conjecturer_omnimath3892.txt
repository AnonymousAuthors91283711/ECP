The error occurs because the proposed answer tries to use variables `a, b, c, d` that aren't in scope for the abbreviation. Since the answer should be a constant expression (not depending on any parameters), we need to find a closed form solution.

From the problem constraints:
1. a + d = 2015
2. b + c = 2015
3. a ≠ c

The equation (x-a)(x-b) = (x-c)(x-d) simplifies to:
x² - (a+b)x + ab = x² - (c+d)x + cd
Which reduces to:
(a+b-c-d)x = ab - cd

Using the constraints:
a + d = 2015 ⇒ d = 2015 - a
b + c = 2015 ⇒ b = 2015 - c

Substituting these into the equation:
(a + (2015 - c) - c - (2015 - a))x = a(2015 - c) - c(2015 - a)
Simplify:
(2a - 2c)x = 2015a - ac - 2015c + ac
(2a - 2c)x = 2015(a - c)
x = 2015(a - c)/(2(a - c)) = 2015/2

Thus the solution is always 2015/2 regardless of specific a,b,c,d values (as long as constraints hold).
