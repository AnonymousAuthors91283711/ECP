Ground Truth Answer: ∅
Proposed Answer: {0, 1, -1, (1 + Real.sqrt 5)/2, (1 - Real.sqrt 5)/2}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation can be rewritten using exponent rules as:
   2^x + 2^(x³) = 2 * 2^(x²) which simplifies to 2^x + 2^(x³) = 2^(x² + 1)

2. The condition requires that either 2^x ≠ 2^(x²) or 2^(x²) ≠ 2^(x³), meaning x ≠ x² or x² ≠ x³

3. The ground truth answer is the empty set (∅), meaning no real numbers satisfy both conditions.

4. The proposed answer suggests several solutions including 0, 1, -1 and golden ratio values.

Analysis:
- x=0: 1 + 1 = 2*1 (true) but 1=1=1 (fails second condition)
- x=1: 2 + 2 = 2*2 (true) but 2=2=2 (fails second condition)
- x=-1: 0.5 + 0.5 = 2*1 (false)
- Golden ratio values: Don't satisfy both conditions

The ground truth is correct - no real numbers satisfy both conditions. The proposed answer incorrectly suggests solutions that either don't satisfy the equation or fail the inequality condition.
