(b c r s : ℝ)
(hbs : r ≠ s ∧ r + s = -b ∧ r * s = 93)
(hcs : (r + 1) ≠ (s + 1) ∧ (r + 1) + (s + 1) = 22 ∧ (r + 1) * (s + 1) = c)

From the given conditions, we can see that:
1. r and s are roots of x² + bx + 93 = 0
2. r+1 and s+1 are roots of x² - 22x + c = 0

The key insight is that c can be expressed in terms of b using the relationships between roots and coefficients. From hbs, we have r + s = -b and rs = 93. From hcs, we have (r+1)(s+1) = c = rs + (r+s) + 1 = 93 - b + 1 = 94 - b.

But also from hcs, (r+1)+(s+1) = 22 ⇒ r+s = 20 ⇒ b = -20. Therefore, c = 94 - (-20) = 114.

<<<114>>>
