Ground Truth Answer: {fun x => x, fun x => -x}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℚ, f = fun x => x - c} ∪ {f | ∃ c : ℚ, f = fun x => -x - c}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The functional equation given is: f(x*f(x) + y) = f(y) + x² for all x,y ∈ ℚ

2. Ground truth provides two specific solutions: f(x) = x and f(x) = -x

3. Proposed answer suggests all linear functions of form f(x) = x - c or f(x) = -x - c for some constant c ∈ ℚ

Testing the proposed solutions:
- For f(x) = x - c: 
  LHS = f(x*f(x) + y) = x*(x-c) + y - c = x² - c x + y - c
  RHS = f(y) + x² = (y - c) + x² = x² + y - c
  These are equal only when c x = 0 for all x ⇒ c = 0
- Similarly for f(x) = -x - c:
  LHS = f(x*(-x-c) + y) = -[x*(-x-c) + y] - c = x² + c x - y - c
  RHS = f(y) + x² = (-y - c) + x² = x² - y - c
  These are equal only when c x = 0 for all x ⇒ c = 0

The only valid solutions in the proposed form are when c=0, which gives exactly the ground truth solutions. The proposed answer incorrectly includes all constants c when only c=0 works.
