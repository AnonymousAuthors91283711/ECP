Ground Truth Answer: 5762
Proposed Answer: 145
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the largest 4-digit number (between 1000 and 9999) where:
   - The number equals the sum of factorials of its last three digits
   - The first digit (A) must be > 0 (which is already implied by n ≥ 1000)

2. Ground truth answer is 5762:
   - Digits: 5,7,6,2
   - Check: 5! + 7! + 6! + 2! = 120 + 5040 + 720 + 2 = 5882 ≠ 5762 (Wait, this seems incorrect)
   - Actually, the problem specifies sum of factorials of last three digits (B,C,D), not all four
   - For 5762: 7! + 6! + 2! = 5040 + 720 + 2 = 5762 (matches)

3. Proposed answer is 145:
   - This is a 3-digit number, not in the required range (1000-9999)
   - While 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145, it doesn't satisfy the 4-digit requirement

The proposed answer fails the basic requirement of being a 4-digit number, while the ground truth correctly satisfies all conditions.
