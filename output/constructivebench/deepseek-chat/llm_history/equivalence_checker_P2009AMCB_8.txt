abbrev P2009AMCB_8_answer : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem P2009AMCB_8 (a b : ℝ) :
  ∃ (w : ℝ) (c : ℝ), 
    (2/3 * c + w = a) ∧ 
    (1/2 * c + w = b) ∧ 
    (c + w = P2009AMCB_8_answer a b) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => 3 * a - 2 * b
Proposed Answer: fun a b => 4 * a - 3 * b
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a system of equations:
   - (2/3)c + w = a
   - (1/2)c + w = b
   - We need to find c + w in terms of a and b

2. Solving the system:
   Subtract second equation from first:
   (2/3 - 1/2)c = a - b => (1/6)c = a - b => c = 6(a - b)

   Substitute c into second equation:
   (1/2)*6(a-b) + w = b => 3(a-b) + w = b => w = b - 3(a-b) = 4b - 3a

   Now c + w = 6(a-b) + (4b-3a) = 3a - 2b

3. The ground truth gives exactly this solution: 3a - 2b
4. The proposed answer gives 4a - 3b, which is incorrect
