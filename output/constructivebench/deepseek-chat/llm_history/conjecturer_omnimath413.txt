<<<99>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks for the greatest k where 2^k divides the count of subsets of {1..100} where primes in the subset outnumber multiples of 4. The answer is 99 because when considering all subsets containing 99 (the largest number ≤100 not prime nor multiple of 4), we maximize the divisibility by 2.
