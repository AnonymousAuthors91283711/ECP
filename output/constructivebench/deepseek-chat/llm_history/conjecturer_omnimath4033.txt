<<<fun n k => Nat.choose (n - 1) (k - 1)>>> 

Explanation: The problem relates to finding the maximum number of pairs (B_i, C_i) with certain intersection properties. The pattern from enumeration suggests binomial coefficients, specifically combinations of (n-1) choose (k-1). This matches known combinatorial bounds for similar set systems.
