theorem omnimath3723 (a b : ℕ) (ha : 0 < a) (hb : 0 < b) :
  Nat.Prime (a^4 + 4*b^4) ↔ (a, b) ∈ omnimath3723_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, n) | n : ℕ} ∪ {(n, 1) | n : ℕ}
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem asks when a⁴ + 4b⁴ is prime, given a, b > 0.

2. The ground truth answer is just (1,1), since:
   - 1⁴ + 4*1⁴ = 5 (prime)
   - For any other (a,b), a⁴ + 4b⁴ can be factored or is too large to be prime

3. The proposed answer includes:
   - All pairs (1,n) for any natural n
   - All pairs (n,1) for any natural n

4. Testing the proposed answer:
   - (1,2): 1 + 4*16 = 65 (not prime)
   - (2,1): 16 + 4 = 20 (not prime)
   - Only (1,1) works in the proposed set

The proposed answer includes many pairs that don't satisfy the condition, while the ground truth correctly identifies only the working pair.
