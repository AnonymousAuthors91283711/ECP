Ground Truth Answer: {0, id}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ k : ℤ, f = fun x => k * x ^ 2}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is a functional equation over integers, asking for all functions f: ℤ → ℤ that satisfy the given condition for all integers a, b, c.

2. The ground truth answer gives two solutions: the zero function (0) and the identity function (id).

3. The proposed answer suggests all quadratic functions of the form f(x) = kx².

Analysis:
- The zero function is indeed a solution (matches both answers)
- The identity function is f(x) = x, which is linear, not quadratic
- Quadratic functions f(x) = kx² don't satisfy the original equation (you can test with a=b=c=1)
- The proposed answer incorrectly includes many non-solutions while missing the identity function

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect as it both includes wrong solutions and misses correct ones.
