Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest natural number n such that there exists a sequence q with:
   - q(0) = q₀ (given positive integer)
   - For i from 1 to n, q(i) = (q(i-1)-1)³ + 3
   - Each q(i) must be a prime power (p^k where p is prime)

2. The ground truth answer is 2, meaning the sequence can maintain the prime power condition for up to 2 steps.

3. The proposed answer is 1, meaning it only works for 1 step.

To verify equivalence:
- For q₀ = 2:
  q(1) = (2-1)³ + 3 = 4 (which is 2², a prime power)
  q(2) = (4-1)³ + 3 = 30 (not a prime power)
  So n=1 works, but n=2 is the maximum.

- For q₀ = 3:
  q(1) = (3-1)³ + 3 = 11 (prime)
  q(2) = (11-1)³ + 3 = 1003 (not a prime power)
  Again n=1 works, but n=2 is maximum.

The proposed answer (1) is too conservative - the maximum n is indeed 2 as shown in the ground truth.
