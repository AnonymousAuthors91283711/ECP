Ground Truth Answer: 26
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n such that when we multiply 123456789 by 10^n, the result is divisible by (2^26 * 5^4) and the remaining factor (k) is coprime with 10.

2. The ground truth answer is 26, which makes sense because:
   - We need enough factors of 2 and 5 to cover the denominator (2^26 * 5^4)
   - 123456789 is odd (so contributes no factors of 2)
   - 123456789 is not divisible by 5 (so contributes no factors of 5)
   - Therefore, we need at least 26 factors of 2 (from 10^n) and 4 factors of 5 (from 10^n)
   - Since 10 = 2*5, we need max(26,4) = 26 to satisfy both requirements

3. The proposed answer is 4, which is incorrect because:
   - While 4 would provide enough factors of 5 (since we need 4)
   - It would only provide 4 factors of 2, but we need 26
   - Therefore, 4 is insufficient

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the requirement for factors of 2.
