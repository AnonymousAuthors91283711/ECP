Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 1), (3, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 3), (3, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all pairs of positive integers (a,b) that satisfy two conditions involving rational equations with integer coefficients.

2. The ground truth answer provides 6 pairs that satisfy these conditions.

3. The proposed answer includes all pairs from the ground truth (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (2,3), (3,3) but adds three extra pairs: (1,1), (1,3), (3,1).

4. We need to check if these extra pairs actually satisfy the original conditions:
   - (1,1): Doesn't satisfy the conditions (try k and m)
   - (1,3): Doesn't satisfy the conditions
   - (3,1): Doesn't satisfy the conditions

The proposed answer includes some correct pairs but also includes incorrect ones that don't satisfy the problem's conditions.
