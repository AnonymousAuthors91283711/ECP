noncomputable abbrev omnimath1442_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1442
: (∑' n : ℕ, (n + 1) * (1 / 1998) ^ n = omnimath1442_answer) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1998 / 1997 ^ 2
Proposed Answer: 1998^2 / 1997^2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about evaluating an infinite series: ∑ (n+1)(1/1998)^n from n=0 to ∞
2. This is a known series type: ∑ (n+1)x^n = 1/(1-x)^2 for |x| < 1
3. Here x = 1/1998, so the sum should be 1/(1 - 1/1998)^2 = 1/(1997/1998)^2 = (1998/1997)^2 = 1998^2/1997^2

The ground truth answer is 1998/1997^2, but according to the calculation, the correct answer should be 1998^2/1997^2. The proposed answer matches our calculation.

Therefore, the ground truth answer is incorrect, and the proposed answer is correct.
