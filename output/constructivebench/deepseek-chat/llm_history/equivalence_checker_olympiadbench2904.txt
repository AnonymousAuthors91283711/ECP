  olympiadbench2904_answer (A, B) = 3750 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun (A, B) => (15 * (1800 / 20) * (1/B) / (1/A))
Proposed Answer: fun (A, B) => (1 / A) * (1 / B) * (3750 / 9)
Let's analyze both answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer: (15 * (1800/20) * (1/B) / (1/A))
   - Simplifies to: (15 * 90 * (1/B) * A) = (1350 * A/B)

2. Proposed Answer: (1/A) * (1/B) * (3750/9)
   - Simplifies to: (3750/9) * 1/(A*B)

When we substitute the given values (A=1/9, B=1/25):
- Ground Truth: 1350 * (1/9)/(1/25) = 1350 * (25/9) = 3750
- Proposed Answer: (3750/9) * 1/((1/9)*(1/25)) = (3750/9) * 225 = 3750 * 25 = 93750

The answers produce different results with the given values, so they are not equivalent.
