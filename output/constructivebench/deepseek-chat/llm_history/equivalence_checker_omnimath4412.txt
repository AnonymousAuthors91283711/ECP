Ground Truth Answer: 1958
Proposed Answer: 1936.0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find the smallest positive real number n such that:
   n + floor(√n) + floor(n^(1/3)) = 2014

2. The ground truth answer is 1958, which means:
   1958 + floor(√1958) + floor(1958^(1/3)) = 2014

3. The proposed answer is 1936.0. Let's check:
   - √1936 = 44 (exact)
   - 1936^(1/3) ≈ 12.47 → floor is 12
   - 1936 + 44 + 12 = 1992 ≠ 2014

The proposed answer clearly doesn't satisfy the equation, while the ground truth does. The difference is significant (1992 vs 2014), so this isn't just a minor calculation error.
