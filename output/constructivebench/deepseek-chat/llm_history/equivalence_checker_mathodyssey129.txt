Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 2
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n = 3 then 2 else if n = 4 then 3 else if n = 5 then 4 else n
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal number of distinct values in a "heard" function in a friendship graph with certain properties. The "heard" function represents the sum of weighted friendships for each node.

2. The ground truth answer claims that for all n > 2, the minimal number is always 2. This suggests that regardless of the graph size (as long as n > 2), you can always construct a configuration where the "heard" function takes exactly 2 distinct values.

3. The proposed answer gives different results for different n values:
   - n=3 → 2 (matches ground truth)
   - n=4 → 3 (differs from ground truth)
   - n=5 → 4 (differs from ground truth)
   - otherwise → n (differs from ground truth)

4. The proposed answer is only correct for n=3, but incorrect for all other cases. The ground truth suggests a constant answer of 2 is possible for all n > 2, while the proposed answer gives varying results.
