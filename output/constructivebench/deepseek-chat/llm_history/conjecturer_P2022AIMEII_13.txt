From the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we need to find a polynomial P ∈ ℤ[X] that has roots at all x ∈ (0,1) and has a specific coefficient at x²⁰²². The only polynomial with roots at all points in (0,1) is the zero polynomial, but that would make all coefficients zero. However, the problem asks for a non-trivial solution, suggesting we need a polynomial that's zero on (0,1) but not identically zero. The only such polynomial is the zero polynomial, but since the problem asks for existence, we can conclude the coefficient must be zero.
