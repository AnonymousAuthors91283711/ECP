Looking at the problem statement and the error message, I notice that:
1. The problem involves geometric sequences (a_n and b_n) with a common ratio r
2. The condition a_15 = b_11 gives us a relationship to solve for r
3. The final answer should be a_9, which we can express in terms of r

From the enumerated answers pattern and the given conditions:
- We can solve for r using a_15 = b_11: 27*r^14 = 99*r^10 ⇒ r^4 = 99/27 ⇒ r = (99/27)^(1/4)
- Then a_9 = 27*r^8 = 27*(r^4)^2 = 27*(99/27)^2

The error in the original proposal was due to incorrect parentheses and exponent handling. Here's the corrected version:

<<<27 * (99 / 27) ^ (2 : ℝ)>>>

This simplifies the expression while maintaining correctness. The key steps are:
1. Recognize the geometric sequence relationship
2. Solve for r^4 from the given equality condition
3. Express a_9 in terms of this ratio
4. Simplify the exponents (8 = 2*4) to make the expression cleaner[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem statement and the error message, I can see that:
1. The problem involves geometric sequences with ratio r
2. The condition a₁₅ = b₁₁ gives us a way to find r
3. We need to find a₉, which will be our final answer

From a₁₅ = b₁₁, we have:
27 * r¹⁴ = 99 * r¹⁰
This simplifies to r⁴ = 99/27 = 11/3
Thus r = (11/3)^(1/4)

Now a₉ = 27 * r⁸ = 27 * (11/3)² = 27 * (121/9) = 363

The error in the original proposal was due to:
1. Missing the noncomputable annotation
2. Incorrect exponent (should be 2, but needs proper type handling)
3. Need to properly handle the real number operations

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2012AIMEII_2_answer : ℝ := 363>>> 

This matches the calculation:
27 * (11/3)^2 = 27 * 121/9 = 3 * 121 = 363
The answer is noncomputable because it involves real number operations that aren't guaranteed to be computable in Lean's type system.
