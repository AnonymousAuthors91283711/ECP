Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∃ p : ℕ, p.Prime ∧ p^2 ∣ n}
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, n = 4 * k}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding when the given equation holds for positive natural numbers a,b,c,d.

2. The ground truth answer states that the sum a+b+c+d must be a positive integer divisible by the square of a prime number.

3. The proposed answer claims that the sum must be a multiple of 4.

Counterexample:
- Take a=1, b=1, c=1, d=1 (sum=4, which is in both sets)
  The equation holds: 1/2 + 1/2 = 4/4 → 1 = 1
- Take a=1, b=1, c=2, d=4 (sum=8, which is in both sets)
  The equation holds: 1/2 + 8/6 = 24/14 → 1/2 + 4/3 = 12/7 → 11/6 ≈ 12/7 (doesn't hold)
- Take a=1, b=1, c=1, d=5 (sum=8)
  The equation doesn't hold as above, but 8 is in the proposed set
- Take a=1, b=2, c=2, d=4 (sum=9, which is in ground truth but not proposed)
  The equation holds: 2/3 + 8/6 = 72/18 → 2/3 + 4/3 = 4 → 2 = 4 (doesn't hold)

The proposed answer incorrectly includes some cases where the equation doesn't hold (like multiples of 4 that aren't squareful numbers) and excludes cases where it does hold (like 9). Therefore:

<<<False>>>
