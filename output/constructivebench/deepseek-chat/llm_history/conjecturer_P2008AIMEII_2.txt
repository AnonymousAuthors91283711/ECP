Looking at the problem, we need to find a velocity v where the running time (r_time) equals the jogging time (j_time). The equations given are:
- r_time = 50/v + 5*(50-1)
- j_time = 50/(0.75v) + 5*(50/2 - 1)

Setting them equal and solving:
50/v + 245 = 200/(3v) + 120
Multiply through by 3v:
150 + 735v = 200 + 360v
375v = 50
v = 50/375 = 2/15

Now plug v back into either time equation to get the total time:
j_time = 50/(0.75*2/15) + 120 = 50/(1.5/15) + 120 = 500 + 120 = 620

The error in the original proposal was using 500/3 (which is approximately 166.67) instead of the correct answer 620. The compilation errors were likely due to type mismatches and noncomputable definitions.

Looking at the problem, we need to find the time when both runners finish simultaneously. The error in the proposed answer is likely due to incorrect handling of the floating point division. Let's analyze the problem:

1. The problem involves two runners with different speeds and stopping patterns
2. The first runner (r) has speed v and stops every 1 mile for 5 minutes
3. The second runner (j) has speed 0.75v and stops every 2 miles for 5 minutes
4. We need to find the total time when both finish 50 miles

The error in the Lean code appears to be a syntax issue with the floating point number 0.75. In Lean, we should represent this as a fraction (3/4) instead of a decimal.

Here's the corrected answer based on solving the equation:
1. For runner r: time = distance/speed + rest time = 50/v + 5*(50-1)
2. For runner j: time = 50/((3/4)*v) + 5*(50/2 - 1)
Setting them equal and solving gives v = 5/3
Substituting back gives total time = 620

Looking at the problem, we need to find the velocity v where Rudolph's time equals Jennifer's time. The error in the Lean code is due to missing semicolons between the let bindings. The mathematical solution involves:

1. Setting Rudolph's time (50/v + 5*49) equal to Jennifer's time (50/(0.75v) + 5*24)
2. Solving for v gives v = 10/3
3. Plugging back into either time formula gives the final answer of 620

The error is purely syntactic - we need proper Lean syntax for multiple let bindings. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<620>>> 

The explanation is:
1. The problem sets up two time equations that must be equal
2. Solving the equation 50/v + 245 = 200/(3v) + 120 gives v = 10/3
3. Substituting v back into either time formula yields 620 as the common time value
4. The Lean error was just missing semicolons between let statements, but the mathematical answer is 620[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
