Ground Truth Answer: 16 / 3
Proposed Answer: 16 / 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. Given equations:
   - w = (4/3)x
   - y = (3/2)z
   - z = (1/6)x

2. We need to find w/y:
   - Substitute z in y's equation: y = (3/2)(1/6)x = (3/12)x = (1/4)x
   - Now w/y = [(4/3)x] / [(1/4)x] = (4/3)/(1/4) = (4/3)*4 = 16/3

The ground truth answer is 16/3, while the proposed answer is 16/9. The proposed answer is incorrect as it's missing the final multiplication by 4 (it stops at (4/3)/(3/4) = 16/9, which would be incorrect).
