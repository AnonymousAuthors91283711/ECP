Ground Truth Answer: 2731
Proposed Answer: 3^12 - 2^13 + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem involves a triple sum of factorial terms with specific ranges. The ground truth is given as 2731. The proposed answer is 3^12 - 2^13 + 1.

Calculating the proposed answer:
3^12 = 531441
2^13 = 8192
531441 - 8192 + 1 = 523250

This clearly doesn't equal 2731. The proposed answer is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
