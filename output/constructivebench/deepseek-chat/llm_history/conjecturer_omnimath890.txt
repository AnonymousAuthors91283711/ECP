{a : ℕ | ∃ b c : ℕ, a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ c > 0 ∧ a + b + c = GCDMonoid.gcd a b + GCDMonoid.gcd b c + GCDMonoid.gcd c a + 120}

<<<60>>> 

Explanation: The problem seeks the greatest natural number a where there exist positive b,c such that a+b+c equals the sum of pairwise gcds plus 120. The enumerated solutions suggest 60 is maximal, likely because it's the largest number where 120 can be partitioned into three parts (a,b,c) whose pairwise gcds sum to a+b+c-120.
