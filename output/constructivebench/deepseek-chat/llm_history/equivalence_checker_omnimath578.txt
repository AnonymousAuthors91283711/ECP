abbrev omnimath578_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath578 (n : ℕ) :
  (digits 10 (∏ i in Finset.range (n + 1), (10^(2^i) - 1))).sum = omnimath578_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 9 * 2^n
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 9 * (n + 1) * 2 ^ n
Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The problem involves summing the digits of a product of numbers of form (10^(2^i)-1) for i from 0 to n.

2. The ground truth answer suggests the sum grows exponentially as 9*2^n.

3. The proposed answer has an extra linear factor (n+1), making it 9*(n+1)*2^n.

4. For small values of n, we can test:
   - n=0: ground truth=9, proposed=9 (match)
   - n=1: ground truth=18, proposed=36 (don't match)
   - n=2: ground truth=36, proposed=108 (don't match)

5. The proposed answer grows much faster than the ground truth due to the extra (n+1) factor.
