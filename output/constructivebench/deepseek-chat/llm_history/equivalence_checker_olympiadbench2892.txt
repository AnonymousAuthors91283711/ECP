Ground Truth Answer: 2604
Proposed Answer: 2048
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a unique number n between 2009 and 3009 where:
   - The sum of its odd divisors equals 1024
   - The number must be unique in this range

2. Ground truth answer is 2604:
   - 2604's odd divisors are 1, 3, 7, 21, 31, 93, 217, 651
   - Sum: 1+3+7+21+31+93+217+651 = 1024

3. Proposed answer is 2048:
   - 2048 is a power of 2 (2^11)
   - Its only odd divisor is 1
   - Sum of odd divisors is 1 ≠ 1024
   - Also, 2048 < 2009 is false (so it's outside the required range)

The proposed answer fails both the divisor sum condition and the range condition. It's completely incorrect.

<<<False>>>
