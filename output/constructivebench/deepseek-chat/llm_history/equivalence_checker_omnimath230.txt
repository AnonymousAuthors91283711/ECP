Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | ∃ m : ℕ, n = 2 ^ m}
Proposed Answer: {n | ∃ k : ℕ, n = 2^k}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer and the ground truth answer are equivalent. Both define the set of natural numbers that are powers of 2. The only difference is in notation:
- Ground truth uses `2 ^ m` (with space)
- Proposed answer uses `2^k` (without space)

Both notations mean the same mathematical operation (exponentiation), and both use `∃` with a natural number exponent. The variable names `m` and `k` are arbitrary and don't affect the meaning. The set builder notation `{n : ℕ | ...}` vs `{n | ...}` is also equivalent when the type ℕ is clear from context.
