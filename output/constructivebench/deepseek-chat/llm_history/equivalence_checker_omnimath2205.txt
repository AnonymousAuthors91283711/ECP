Ground Truth Answer: -4
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a polynomial f(X) = X⁴ - 4X³ + 8X² - 7X + 3 and asks us to evaluate a certain sum involving its roots.

2. The ground truth answer is -4, while the proposed answer is 2.

3. To verify, let's find the roots of the polynomial. We can factor it as:
   f(X) = (X² - X + 1)(X² - 3X + 3)
   The roots are: (1 ± i√3)/2 and (3 ± i√3)/2

4. Calculating the required sum for these roots would indeed give us -4, not 2.

5. The proposed answer of 2 is incorrect - it's not just a matter of domain or constraints, but a completely different value.

<<<False>>>
