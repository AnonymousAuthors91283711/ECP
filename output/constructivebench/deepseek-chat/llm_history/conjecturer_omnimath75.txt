Based on the error message and the problem statement, the issue is with the ambiguous reference to `Prime`. We need to specify which `Prime` we're using (either `Nat.Prime` or `_root_.Prime`). Since we're working with natural numbers, we should use `Nat.Prime`.

The problem asks for numbers m where there exists a prime p that doesn't divide any number of the form n^m - m. From the enumerated answers pattern (likely including 1 and other numbers with specific properties), we can generalize that these are numbers m where m-1 has no prime divisors, i.e., m-1 must be 1 (since 1 is the only natural number with no prime divisors).

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<{m | m = 1 ∨ m = 2}>>>

Explanation:
1. The error is fixed by using `Nat.Prime` explicitly (though in the final answer we don't need it as we're not directly referencing primes)
2. The answer is simplified to {1, 2} because:
   - For m=1: n^1-1 = n-1, and there are primes that don't divide any n-1 (e.g., 2 doesn't divide odd n-1)
   - For m=2: n^2-2, and there are primes that don't divide any n^2-2 (e.g., 3)
   - For m>2, it becomes harder to satisfy the condition for all n
