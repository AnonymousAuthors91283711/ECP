theorem omnimath1738 (f : ℤ → ℤ) :
  (∀ x y, f (4*x + 3*y) = f (3*x + y) + f (x + 2*y)) ↔ omnimath1738_answer f := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun f => ∃ a b, ∀ x, (5 ∣ x → f x = a * x / 5) ∧ (¬5 ∣ x → f x = b * x)
Proposed Answer: fun f => ∃ a b, ∀ x, f x = a * x + b
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about characterizing all integer functions f: ℤ → ℤ that satisfy the given functional equation.

2. The ground truth answer states that f must be piecewise defined based on divisibility by 5, with different linear behaviors for numbers divisible by 5 versus those not divisible by 5.

3. The proposed answer suggests a simple linear function f(x) = a*x + b for all x, without any piecewise conditions.

The two answers are fundamentally different:
- The ground truth allows for different slopes (a/5 vs b) depending on divisibility by 5
- The proposed answer forces a single linear behavior for all integers

The proposed answer is too restrictive and doesn't account for the piecewise nature required by the functional equation. The ground truth shows the function can have different behaviors on different arithmetic progressions.
