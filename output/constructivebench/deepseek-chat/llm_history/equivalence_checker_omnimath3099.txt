Ground Truth Answer: 13/27
Proposed Answer: (11 : ℚ) / 54
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating a probability based on dice faces [2,3,4,5,6,7].
2. totalDots = 2+3+4+5+6+7 = 27
3. oddFaces = [3,5,7]
4. The probability calculation has two parts:
   - First part: sum over odd faces of (n-1)*(1/27)
   - Second part: sum over odd faces of 1/(6*27)

Calculating first part:
(3-1)/27 + (5-1)/27 + (7-1)/27 = 2/27 + 4/27 + 6/27 = 12/27

Calculating second part:
3 * (1/162) = 3/162 = 1/54

Total probability:
12/27 + 1/54 = 24/54 + 1/54 = 25/54

However, the ground truth is 13/27 = 26/54, and proposed answer is 11/54.

Neither matches our calculation. The proposed answer (11/54) is significantly different from both our calculation and the ground truth.
