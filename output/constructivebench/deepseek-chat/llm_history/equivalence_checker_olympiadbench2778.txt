Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the last digit (mod 10) of the expression (23^2023 + 23^20 - 23^23).

2. We can simplify by looking at the last digit of 23, which is 3. So we're really looking at (3^2023 + 3^20 - 3^23) mod 10.

3. The powers of 3 cycle every 4 in their last digit:
   - 3^1 ≡ 3 mod 10
   - 3^2 ≡ 9 mod 10
   - 3^3 ≡ 7 mod 10
   - 3^4 ≡ 1 mod 10
   and then repeats.

4. Calculating each exponent mod 4:
   - 2023 mod 4 = 3 (since 2020 is divisible by 4)
   - 20 mod 4 = 0
   - 23 mod 4 = 3

5. So:
   - 3^2023 ≡ 7 mod 10
   - 3^20 ≡ 1 mod 10
   - 3^23 ≡ 7 mod 10

6. Putting it together: (7 + 1 - 7) mod 10 = 1 mod 10

The ground truth answer is 1, while the proposed answer is 8. These are clearly different.
