abbrev P2015AMCB_2_answer : ℕ × ℕ → ℕ × ℕ := sorry
theorem P2015AMCB_2 : P2015AMCB_2_answer (13, 0) = (15, 30) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun (startHour, startMin) => 
    let startTime := startHour * 60 + startMin
    let endSecondTask := 14 * 60 + 40
    let duration := (endSecondTask - startTime) / 2
    let totalDuration := 3 * duration
    let finishTime := startTime + totalDuration
    (finishTime / 60, finishTime % 60)
Proposed Answer: fun (a, b) => (a + 2, 2 * a + b + 4)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating the finish time of a task that takes 3 times the duration of half the time between start and 14:40.

2. Ground Truth Answer:
   - Correctly calculates the duration as half the time between start and 14:40
   - Multiplies by 3 for total duration
   - Adds to start time and converts back to hours/minutes

3. Proposed Answer:
   - Gives a simple linear transformation (a+2, 2a+b+4)
   - For input (13,0) it gives (15,30) which matches the theorem
   - However, this doesn't account for the actual time calculation logic
   - It would fail for other inputs (e.g. (14,0) should give (15,20) but gives (16,32))

The proposed answer gives the correct output for the specific case (13,0) but doesn't implement the correct general calculation. Therefore, it's not equivalent to the ground truth answer.
