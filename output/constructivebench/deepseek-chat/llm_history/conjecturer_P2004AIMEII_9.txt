Looking at the enumerated sequence values and the pattern in the problem statement, we can observe that:
1. For odd indices (2n+1), the sequence follows squares: 1=1², 9=3², 25=5², etc.
2. For even indices (2n), it follows triangular numbers: 2=1*2, 6=2*3, 12=3*4, etc.

The answer should be the maximum n where seq(n) < 1000 plus its sequence value. From the pattern, the maximum occurs at n=62 (since 31²=961 < 1000 but 32²=1024 > 1000).

<<<961 + 62 * 63 / 2>>>
