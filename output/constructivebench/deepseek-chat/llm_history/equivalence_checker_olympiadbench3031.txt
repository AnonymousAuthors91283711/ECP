Ground Truth Answer: 210
Proposed Answer: 2^(19 * 21 / 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the exponent K in the prime factorization of the product of all divisors of n=2^20.

2. The ground truth answer is 210, which is correct because:
   - Number of divisors d = T+1 = 21 (for n=2^T)
   - The product of divisors is n^(d/2) = (2^20)^(21/2) = 2^(20*21/2) = 2^210
   - Therefore K = 210

3. The proposed answer is 2^(19*21/2), which evaluates to 2^199.5 (not an integer) and is clearly different from 210.

The proposed answer is incorrect both in form (should be just the exponent, not 2^exponent) and in value (199.5 vs 210).
