Ground Truth Answer: fun a p x => a * (padicValNat p x)
Proposed Answer: fun a p n => if n = 0 then 0 else a * (n.factorization p)
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. The ground truth uses `padicValNat p x` which gives the exponent of prime p in the factorization of x.
2. The proposed answer uses `n.factorization p` which also gives the exponent of prime p in the factorization of n.

The key differences are:
- The proposed answer adds a special case for n=0 (returning 0)
- `padicValNat p 0` is defined to be 0 in Lean's mathlib
- For n≠0, both expressions are equivalent (a * exponent of p in factorization)

Since `padicValNat p 0 = 0` matches the proposed answer's special case, and for all other n they are identical, the answers are equivalent.
