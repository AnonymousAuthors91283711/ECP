Ground Truth Answer: 42
Proposed Answer: 14
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a set S of real numbers y that satisfy certain conditions with x and z.
2. It claims there are exactly two distinct y values (y₁ and y₂) in S.
3. The theorem states that -(y₁ + y₂) equals some answer.

The ground truth says this value is 42, meaning y₁ + y₂ = -42.
The proposed answer says 14, meaning y₁ + y₂ = -14.

These are clearly different numerical values. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth.

Let's verify the math:
From the conditions:
1. x + y = 7 ⇒ x = 7 - y
2. (x + y + z)² = 4 ⇒ (7 + z)² = 4 ⇒ z = -7 ± 2 ⇒ z ∈ {-9, -5}
3. x * z = -180 ⇒ (7 - y) * z = -180

For z = -9: (7 - y)(-9) = -180 ⇒ y = 7 - 20 = -13
For z = -5: (7 - y)(-5) = -180 ⇒ y = 7 - 36 = -29

Thus y₁ = -13, y₂ = -29
y₁ + y₂ = -42
-(y₁ + y₂) = 42

The proposed answer (14) is incorrect.
