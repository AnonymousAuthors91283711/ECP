Ground Truth Answer: fun _ => 0
Proposed Answer: fun (x, y) => x - y
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is asking for all functions f that satisfy the condition that for any unit square ABCD, f(A)+f(B)+f(C)+f(D)=0.

2. The ground truth answer is the zero function (fun _ => 0), which clearly satisfies the condition since 0+0+0+0=0.

3. The proposed answer is f(x,y) = x - y. Let's test this on a unit square:
   - Take A=(0,0), B=(1,0), C=(1,1), D=(0,1)
   - f(A)+f(B)+f(C)+f(D) = (0-0)+(1-0)+(1-1)+(0-1) = 0 + 1 + 0 - 1 = 0
   - This works for this square, but does it work for all unit squares?

4. Consider a rotated unit square:
   - A=(1,1), B=(0,2), C=(-1,1), D=(0,0)
   - f(A)+f(B)+f(C)+f(D) = (1-1)+(0-2)+(-1-1)+(0-0) = 0 - 2 - 2 + 0 = -4 ≠ 0
   - The proposed function fails for rotated squares

The proposed answer works for axis-aligned unit squares but not for all possible unit squares (including rotated ones), while the ground truth works universally. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
