Ground Truth Answer: 10
Proposed Answer: 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves finding the ceiling of 2w given that the integral of the ceiling function squared from 0 to w equals 20√7.

2. The ceiling function ⌈x⌉ makes this a step function where the integral becomes a sum of squares of integers over unit intervals.

3. To satisfy ∫(⌈x⌉²)dx = 20√7 ≈ 52.915, we need to find where this sum crosses this value.

4. Calculating the partial sums:
   - For n=7: sum(k=1 to 7) of k² = 140
   - For n=6: sum(k=1 to 6) of k² = 91
   - For n=5: sum(k=1 to 5) of k² = 55 (closest to 52.915)

5. The integral would reach 20√7 somewhere between x=5 and x=6, making w ≈ 5.3.

6. Then 2w ≈ 10.6, so ⌈2w⌉ = 11 (but ground truth says 10, which seems incorrect).

However, the ground truth answer is given as 10, while the proposed answer is 7. Neither matches our calculation, but the proposed answer (7) is particularly far off.
