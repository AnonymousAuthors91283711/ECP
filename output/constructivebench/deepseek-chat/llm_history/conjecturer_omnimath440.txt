<<<{id, fun _ => 1}>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks for functions f where f(n!) = (f n)! and differences are divisible by non-equal arguments' differences. The identity function and constant 1 function satisfy both conditions:
1. For id: id(n!) = n! = (id n)!
2. For const 1: 1 = 1! (regardless of input)
Both satisfy the divisibility condition trivially (differences are 0 or equal to input differences).
