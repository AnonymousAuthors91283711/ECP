  Odd (omnimath3405_answer x) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 7 * x + 4
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℤ => (3 * x + 1) / 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
- We need to find a function f: ℤ → ℤ such that for all integers x where 3x+1 is even, f(x) is odd.
- The ground truth answer is f(x) = 7x + 4
- The proposed answer is f(x) = (3x + 1)/2

Evaluation:
1. Ground truth answer:
   - 7x + 4 is always odd (since 7x alternates parity with x, and +4 preserves it)
   - Works for all x where 3x+1 is even (which is when x is odd)

2. Proposed answer:
   - (3x + 1)/2 is defined when 3x+1 is even (matches condition h)
   - For x odd: Let x = 2k+1
     (3(2k+1)+1)/2 = (6k+4)/2 = 3k+2
     - If k is even (k=2m): 6m+2 (even)
     - If k is odd (k=2m+1): 6m+5 (odd)
   - So the proposed function sometimes returns even numbers when x is odd

Conclusion:
The proposed answer fails to always return odd numbers when 3x+1 is even (specifically when x ≡ 1 mod 4).
