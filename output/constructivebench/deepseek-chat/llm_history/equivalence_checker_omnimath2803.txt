(hab : a = (2 / 3) * b ∧ b ≠ 0)
: (9 * a + 8 * b) / (6 * a) = omnimath2803_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 7 / 2
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a relationship between a and b: a = (2/3)*b with b ≠ 0
2. We need to evaluate the expression (9a + 8b)/(6a)
3. Substituting a = (2/3)b into the expression:
   (9*(2/3)b + 8b) / (6*(2/3)b) = (6b + 8b)/(4b) = (14b)/(4b) = 14/4 = 7/2

The ground truth answer is indeed 7/2 (which simplifies from 14/4).

The proposed answer is 2, which is incorrect. The correct simplification leads to 7/2, not 2.
