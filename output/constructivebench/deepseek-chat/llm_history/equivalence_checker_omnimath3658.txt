Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0, 0)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b, c) | (a = 0 ∧ b = 0) ∨ (a = 0 ∧ c = 0) ∨ (b = 0 ∧ c = 0) ∨ 
    (a = 0 ∧ (b = 1 ∨ b = -1) ∧ (c = 1 ∨ c = -1)) ∨ 
    (b = 0 ∧ (a = 1 ∨ a = -1) ∧ (c = 1 ∨ c = -1)) ∨ 
    (c = 0 ∧ (a = 1 ∨ a = -1) ∧ (b = 1 ∨ b = -1))}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation is a² + b² + c² = a²b²
2. Ground truth claims only (0,0,0) satisfies this
3. Proposed answer suggests many more solutions

Testing the proposed solutions:
- (0,0,0): 0+0+0=0*0 → valid
- (0,1,1): 0+1+1=0*1 → 2=0 → invalid
- (1,0,1): 1+0+1=1*0 → 2=0 → invalid
- (1,1,0): 1+1+0=1*1 → 2=1 → invalid

Only (0,0,0) actually satisfies the equation. The proposed answer incorrectly includes many non-solutions.
