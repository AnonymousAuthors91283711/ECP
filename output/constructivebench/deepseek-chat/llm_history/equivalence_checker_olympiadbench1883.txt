Ground Truth Answer: fun n => ⌈(n : ℝ) / 2⌉.toNat + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (n + 1) / 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal size of a set S of integers where for every Fibonacci number F(k) with 2 ≤ k ≤ n, there exist x,y ∈ S such that x-y = F(k).

2. The ground truth answer is ⌈n/2⌉ + 1 (using ceiling function and converting back to Nat).

3. The proposed answer is (n + 1)/2 (using integer division).

Key observations:
- For even n: both answers give n/2 + 1
- For odd n: ground truth gives (n+1)/2 + 1, while proposed gives (n+1)/2

The difference is exactly 1 for odd n. The proposed answer is missing the "+1" term that's present in the ground truth.
