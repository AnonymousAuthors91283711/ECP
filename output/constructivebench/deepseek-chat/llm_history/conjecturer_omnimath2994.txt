From the problem statement, we need to find Natalie's score given:
1. Jiayin's score is 161 (hjiayin)
2. The average of all three scores is 171 (havg)

The proposed answer tried to express Natalie in terms of harpreet, but harpreet is a variable in the theorem statement, not available in the answer definition. Since we can't reference harpreet directly, we need a closed-form expression.

The correct approach is:
1. Total sum = average * 3 = 171 * 3
2. Natalie's score = Total sum - Jiayin's score - Harpreet's score
But since we can't express Harpreet, we realize the problem is underconstrained - there are infinitely many solutions for Natalie depending on Harpreet's value. However, looking at the enumerated answers (though none provided), we might suspect the problem expects us to find a specific relationship.

Given the lack of constraints on Harpreet, the most reasonable answer is to express Natalie in terms of the given constants only, which would be the average case where Harpreet equals the average (171). This gives:

<<<171 * 3 - 161 - 171>>> 

This simplifies to 171 + (171 - 161) = 181, which might be the intended answer if we assume Harpreet scored the average. Without more constraints, this is the most reasonable closed-form solution.
