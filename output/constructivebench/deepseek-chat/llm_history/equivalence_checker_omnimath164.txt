Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n - 1)^2 / 2
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n < 3 then 0 else (n / 2) * (n - (n / 2))
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The problem is about finding the maximum number of 3-term arithmetic progressions in a set of n real numbers.

Ground truth: (n-1)²/2
Proposed: if n < 3 then 0 else (n/2)*(n - (n/2))

Let's evaluate both for several values of n:

n=1:
- Ground truth: (0)²/2 = 0
- Proposed: 0 (from n < 3 case)
- Match

n=2:
- Ground truth: (1)²/2 = 0.5 → but since we need integer results, this would be 0
- Proposed: 0 (from n < 3 case)
- Match

n=3:
- Ground truth: (2)²/2 = 2
- Proposed: (1.5)*(3-1.5) = 2.25 → integer part is 2
- Match

n=4:
- Ground truth: (3)²/2 = 4.5 → integer part is 4
- Proposed: (2)*(4-2) = 4
- Match

n=5:
- Ground truth: (4)²/2 = 8
- Proposed: (2.5)*(5-2.5) = 6.25 → integer part is 6
- Doesn't match

The answers diverge at n=5 and beyond. The proposed answer underestimates the ground truth for n ≥ 5.
