Ground Truth Answer: 224/225
Proposed Answer: 1 / 4 - 1 / 900
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: 224/225
2. Proposed: 1/4 - 1/900 = (225/900 - 1/900) = 224/900 = 56/225

Now compare 224/225 (ground truth) vs 56/225 (proposed):
224/225 ≠ 56/225

The proposed answer simplifies to 56/225, which is exactly 1/4 of the correct answer (224/225). This suggests a calculation error in the proposed solution where they might have missed multiplying by 4 somewhere in their telescoping series approach.
