theorem olympiadbench2857 (T : ℕ) :
  let k := T + 1
  let total := k * (k - 1)^4
  let at_most_two_colors := k + k * (k - 1) * ((k - 1)^3 - (k - 2)^3)
  let valid := total - at_most_two_colors
  valid = olympiadbench2857_answer T := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun T => (T + 1) * T^4 - (T + 1) * T - (T + 1) * choose T 2 * (2 * T^3 - 3 * T^2 + T)
Proposed Answer: fun T : ℕ => (T + 1) * T^3 * (T - 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines:
   - k = T + 1
   - total = k * (k-1)^4
   - at_most_two_colors = k + k*(k-1)*((k-1)^3 - (k-2)^3)
   - valid = total - at_most_two_colors

2. Ground truth answer expands to:
   (T+1)*T^4 - (T+1)*T - (T+1)*T*(T-1)/2*(2T^3-3T^2+T)

3. Proposed answer is:
   (T+1)*T^3*(T-1)

Let's test with T=2:
- Ground truth: 3*16 - 3*2 - 3*1*(16-12+2) = 48-6-18 = 24
- Proposed: 3*8*1 = 24

T=3:
- Ground truth: 4*81 - 4*3 - 4*3*2/2*(54-27+3) = 324-12-4*3*30 = 324-12-360 = -48
- Proposed: 4*27*2 = 216

The answers don't match for T=3, so they're not equivalent.
