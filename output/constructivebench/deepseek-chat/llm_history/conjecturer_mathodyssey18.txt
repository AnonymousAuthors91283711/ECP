Looking at the problem constraints and the pattern of possible solutions, we can deduce that the sum a + b must satisfy certain quadratic relationships. The enumerated answers suggest the solution is likely 99, as it's the only number that consistently fits the given conditions when a and b are two-digit numbers.

<<<99>>>
