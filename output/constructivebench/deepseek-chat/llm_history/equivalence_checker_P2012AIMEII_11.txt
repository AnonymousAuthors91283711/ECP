Ground Truth Answer: (5, 8)
Proposed Answer: (1509, 3016)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves finding a unique rational fixed point x = m/n (in lowest terms) of the 1001st iterate of function f₁, with the condition that m + n equals some target sum.

2. The ground truth answer is (5,8), meaning x = 5/8 and m+n = 13.

3. The proposed answer is (1509,3016), meaning x = 1509/3016 and m+n = 4525.

The key observations:
- 1509/3016 simplifies to 3/8 (dividing numerator and denominator by 503)
- 3/8 is not equal to 5/8
- The simplified form 3/8 would give m+n=11, not matching the ground truth's 13
- The unsimplified form gives a much larger sum (4525) than the ground truth (13)

Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect both in terms of the fraction value and the sum condition.

<<<False>>>
