Ground Truth Answer: fun n => choose n 2
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (n - 1) * n / 2
<<<True>>>

Explanation: 
The ground truth answer is the binomial coefficient "n choose 2" (number of ways to choose 2 elements from n), which is exactly equal to (n-1)*n/2. These are two equivalent ways to express the same mathematical quantity. The problem appears to be about finding the minimum number of 2-element subsets needed to satisfy certain separation conditions, which would indeed be all possible pairs, i.e., "n choose 2". The proposed answer correctly gives this value in a different but equivalent form.
