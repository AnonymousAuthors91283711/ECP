Looking at the problem, we need to minimize s = x + y*z under the constraints x*y + z = 160 with x,y,z > 0. To minimize s, we should minimize y*z while keeping x as small as possible. The optimal case occurs when x=1, y=79, z=81 (since 1*79 + 81 = 160), giving s=1 + 79*81 = 6400. However, checking smaller y values: when y=2, z=158, s=2 + 2*158=318; y=3 gives s=3 + 3*157=474; y=4 gives s=4 + 4*156=628. The minimal s occurs at y=2.
