Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: 21
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for three distinct digits P, Q, R (each between 0 and 9) that satisfy a specific equation, and then sum P + Q + R.

2. The equation given is:
   100P + 70 + R + 300 + 90 + R = 100R + 10Q
   Simplifying: 100P + 460 + 2R = 100R + 10Q
   Rearranged: 100P + 460 = 100R + 10Q - 2R
   Which becomes: 100P + 460 = 98R + 10Q

3. Testing possible values:
   - For R=6: 100P + 460 = 588 + 10Q → 100P = 128 + 10Q → P=1, Q=2.8 (invalid)
   - For R=7: 100P + 460 = 686 + 10Q → 100P = 226 + 10Q → P=2, Q=2.6 (invalid)
   - For R=8: 100P + 460 = 784 + 10Q → 100P = 324 + 10Q → P=3, Q=2.4 (invalid)
   - For R=9: 100P + 460 = 882 + 10Q → 100P = 422 + 10Q → P=4, Q=2.2 (invalid)

4. The ground truth answer is 13, which would correspond to P=4, Q=2, R=7 (sum 13), but this doesn't satisfy the equation exactly.

5. The proposed answer is 21, which would require much larger digits that can't satisfy the constraints.

Both answers appear incorrect based on the equation, but the ground truth answer (13) is closer to a plausible solution. The proposed answer (21) is clearly wrong as it exceeds the maximum possible sum (9+8+7=24) and doesn't satisfy the equation.
