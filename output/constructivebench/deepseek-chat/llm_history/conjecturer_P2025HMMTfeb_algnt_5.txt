From the error message, we can see that the proposed answer is a function (ℤ[X] → ℤ) but the expected type is simply ℤ. The problem asks for a specific integer value that equals Q.eval 10 - Q.eval 0 for any monic polynomial Q of degree 4 satisfying certain conditions.

Looking at the pattern in the proposed answer (40, 10000, 100 coefficients), we can deduce that for a monic degree 4 polynomial Q, Q.eval 10 - Q.eval 0 would be:
10^4 - 0^4 + a*(10^3 - 0^3) + b*(10^2 - 0^2) + c*(10^1 - 0^1)
= 10000 + 1000a + 100b + 10c

But since Q is monic (coeff 4 = 1) and must satisfy the given root conditions, we can determine the coefficients. The minimal polynomial for √3 + √2 is x⁴ - 10x² + 1, which gives us the pattern for coefficients:
- coeff 4 = 1 (monic)
- coeff 3 = 0
- coeff 2 = -10
- coeff 1 = 0

Plugging these into our formula:
10000 + 1000*0 + 100*(-10) + 10*0 = 10000 - 1000 = 9000

<<<9000>>>

Explanation: The answer comes from evaluating the difference Q(10) - Q(0) for the minimal polynomial of √3 + √2, which is x⁴ - 10x² + 1. The calculation simplifies to 10⁴ - 10*(10²) - (0⁴ - 10*0²) = 10000 - 1000 = 9000. This must hold for any monic polynomial Q of minimal degree satisfying the given conditions.
