From the problem statement and error message, I can see that the proposed answer tried to use `q` directly, but `q` is a parameter in the theorem, not available in the answer definition. The problem involves solving for a sequence relationship and finding a closed form expression.

Looking at the given equation:
(3*p - q) - p = (3*p + q) - (3*p - q)

Simplifying both sides:
Left side: 2p - q
Right side: 2q

Setting them equal: 2p - q = 2q ⇒ 2p = 3q ⇒ p = (3/2)q

Given q = 9, we can find p = 13.5

Now evaluating the expression:
(3*p + q) + 2010 * ((3*p + q) - (3*p - q)) 
= (3*13.5 + 9) + 2010*(2q) 
= 49.5 + 9 + 2010*18 
= 36189.5

But since q=9, we can generalize this to 2010*2q + q = 4021q

Here's the corrected answer in Lean:

<<<4021 * 9>>> 

Explanation: The solution involves solving for p in terms of q from the given sequence equation, then substituting back into the final expression. The pattern from simplification shows the answer depends linearly on q, and with q=9, the final value is 4021*9. The error was fixed by removing dependency on the parameter q and using the given value 9 directly.
