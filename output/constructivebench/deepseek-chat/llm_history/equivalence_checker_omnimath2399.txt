Ground Truth Answer: 105
Proposed Answer: choose 8 4
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting the number of functions from Fin 12 → Fin 2 (which can be seen as binary strings of length 12) where:
   - Exactly 4 ones appear (sum is 4)
   - No two consecutive ones appear (the second condition)

2. This is equivalent to counting binary strings of length 12 with exactly 4 ones where no two ones are adjacent.

3. The standard combinatorial solution for this is to place the 4 ones with at least one zero between them, then distribute the remaining zeros. This gives us C(12-4+1, 4) = C(9,4) = 126, but this doesn't match the ground truth.

4. However, the ground truth answer is 105, which is C(9,4) - C(8,3) = 126-21=105. This suggests there might be an additional constraint we're missing.

5. The proposed answer "choose 8 4" would mean C(8,4) = 70, which doesn't match either the ground truth or the standard combinatorial solution.
