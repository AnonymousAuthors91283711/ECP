Ground Truth Answer: fun n => {k | n ≤ k ∧ k ≤ (3 * n + 1) / 2}
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => {k | k ≤ n ∧ k ≡ n [MOD 2]} ∪ {k | n < k ∧ k ≡ 0 [MOD 2]}
Let me analyze the problem and compare the answers.

Problem Analysis:
- We're dealing with a problem about coin flipping/arrangement where we have 2n coins
- We need to determine for which k values (between 1 and 2n) we can guarantee all heads or all tails in the first n coins after some operations
- The ground truth answer suggests k must be between n and (3n+1)/2

Comparing Answers:
1. Ground truth: k must be between n and (3n+1)/2
2. Proposed answer: 
   - Either k ≤ n and same parity as n, OR
   - k > n and even

These are not equivalent:
- For n=3:
  - Ground truth: k ∈ {3,4,5} (since (3*3+1)/2=5)
  - Proposed: {1,3} ∪ {4,6} = {1,3,4,6}
  - 1 and 6 shouldn't be included, 5 is missing

- For n=4:
  - Ground truth: k ∈ {4,5,6} (since (3*4+1)/2=6.5 → 6)
  - Proposed: {2,4} ∪ {6,8} = {2,4,6,8}
  - 2 and 8 shouldn't be included, 5 is missing

The proposed answer includes some incorrect values and misses some correct ones.
