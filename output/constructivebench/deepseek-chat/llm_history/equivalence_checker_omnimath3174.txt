Ground Truth Answer: 7
Proposed Answer: 6
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find the digit (0-9) that cannot be expressed as the last digit of (b! - a!) where 0 < a < b.

2. The ground truth answer is 7, meaning 7 cannot be the last digit of any such factorial difference.

3. The proposed answer is 6.

To verify, let's consider possible last digits of factorial differences:
- Factorials ≥5! always end with 0 (since they include both 2 and 5 as factors)
- Therefore, for b ≥5, b! - a! ≡ 0 - a! mod 10
- We just need to check a! mod 10 for 1 ≤ a ≤4:
  a=1: 1! ≡1 → difference ≡9
  a=2: 2! ≡2 → difference ≡8
  a=3: 6 → difference ≡4
  a=4: 24 ≡4 → difference ≡6
- For b <5, we can manually check all cases and find all digits except 7 appear.

The proposed answer (6) is incorrect because we can get 6 as the last digit (e.g. 5!-4! = 120-24=96, which ends with 6). The correct impossible digit is indeed 7.
