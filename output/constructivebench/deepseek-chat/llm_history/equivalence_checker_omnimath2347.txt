Ground Truth Answer: 23
Proposed Answer: (24 * 22! * 3!) * 26! / (23 * 23! * 2! * 26!)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem is asking to find the ratio p1/p2 where:
   - p1 = (24 * 22! * 3!) / 26!
   - p2 = (23 * 23! * 2!) / 26!

2. The ground truth answer is simply 23.

3. The proposed answer is: (24 * 22! * 3!) * 26! / (23 * 23! * 2! * 26!)

Let's simplify the proposed answer:
- The 26! terms cancel out
- We get: (24 * 22! * 3!) / (23 * 23! * 2!)
- Note that 23! = 23 * 22!, so this simplifies further to: (24 * 3!) / (23 * 23 * 2!)
- 3! = 6, 2! = 2, so this becomes (24 * 6) / (23 * 23 * 2) = 144 / 1058 ≈ 0.136 (not 23)

The proposed answer is incorrect in its formulation and doesn't simplify to the correct answer. The correct simplification should be:
p1/p2 = [(24 * 22! * 3!)/26!] / [(23 * 23! * 2!)/26!] = (24 * 22! * 3!) / (23 * 23! * 2!) = 24/23 * (22!/23!) * (3!/2!) = 24/23 * 1/23 * 3 = 72/529 ≈ 0.136

This doesn't equal 23, so either the problem statement is incorrect or the ground truth answer is wrong. However, based on the given information, the proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth.
