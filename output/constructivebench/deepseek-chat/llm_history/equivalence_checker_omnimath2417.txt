Ground Truth Answer: 25502400
Proposed Answer: 999900
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the sum of (n³ + 3n² + 3n) from n=1 to 99.

2. We can simplify the expression inside the sum:
   n³ + 3n² + 3n = n(n² + 3n + 3) = n(n+1)(n+2) - n

3. However, a better simplification is:
   n³ + 3n² + 3n = (n+1)³ - 1

4. Therefore, the sum becomes:
   ∑[(n+1)³ - 1] from n=1 to 99 = ∑(k³) from k=2 to 100 - 99

5. Using the formula for sum of cubes (∑k³ = (n(n+1)/2)²):
   = [100*101/2]² - 1 - 99 = 5050² - 100 = 25502500 - 100 = 25502400

The ground truth answer (25502400) matches this calculation, while the proposed answer (999900) is incorrect.
