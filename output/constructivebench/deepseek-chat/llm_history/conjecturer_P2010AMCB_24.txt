Based on the problem statement and error message, I need to provide a noncomputable real number answer involving √2. The error suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it uses Real.sqrt. The problem involves calculating the sum of interval lengths where a certain function f(x) > 1, and the given intervals sum to (1 - √2 - (-1)) + (1/2 - 0) + (1 + √2 - 1) = (2 - √2) + (1/2) + (√2) = 2.5.

Here's the corrected answer with explanation:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2010AMCB_24_answer : ℝ := 5/2>>>

Explanation:
1. The error is fixed by adding 'noncomputable' since we're working with Real.sqrt
2. The sum simplifies to: (2 - √2) + 0.5 + √2 = 2.5
3. Using 5/2 instead of 2.5 ensures exact representation in Lean
4. The √2 terms cancel out, leaving just the rational number 5/2
5. This matches the interval length calculation in the problem statement[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the problem statement, we need to compute the sum of lengths of three intervals:
1. I1: (-1) to (1 - √2) → length = (1 - √2) - (-1) = 2 - √2
2. I2: 0 to 1/2 → length = 1/2 - 0 = 1/2
3. I3: 1 to (1 + √2) → length = (1 + √2) - 1 = √2

The total length is (2 - √2) + (1/2) + √2 = 2 + 1/2 = 5/2

The error occurs because we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real numbers. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2010AMCB_24_answer : ℝ := 5/2>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem involves real numbers and square roots, making it noncomputable in Lean
2. The sum simplifies to 5/2 because the √2 terms cancel out
3. The answer matches the expected type ℝ
4. The noncomputable annotation is required for real number operations in Lean[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the problem statement and the error message, we need to provide a noncomputable real number answer. The error suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real number operations. The proposed answer 5/2 seems correct based on the calculation shown in the theorem statement (sum of interval lengths).

Here's the fixed answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2010AMCB_24_answer : ℝ := 5/2>>>

Explanation:
1. The error occurs because Lean requires noncomputable declarations for real number operations involving division.
2. The theorem shows the sum of interval lengths equals the answer:
   - (1 - √2 - (-1)) = 2 - √2
   - (1/2 - 0) = 1/2
   - (1 + √2 - 1) = √2
   Sum: (2 - √2) + 1/2 + √2 = 2 + 1/2 = 5/2
3. The answer 5/2 matches this calculation exactly.
