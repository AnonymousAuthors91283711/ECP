Ground Truth Answer: 350
Proposed Answer: 724
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the smallest number N (between 1 and 1024) where the expected number of rounds is less than 2.

2. The expected_rounds function calculates a sum of probabilities over 10 rounds, where each term (1 - (n-1)/1024)^k represents the probability of not having succeeded in the first k rounds.

3. The ground truth answer is 350, while the proposed answer is 724.

4. Intuitively, as n increases, the expected number of rounds should decrease (since (n-1)/1024 increases, making each term smaller). Therefore, the smallest N satisfying the condition should be a relatively small number, not a large one like 724.

5. 724 is actually much closer to the upper bound (1024) than to the lower bound (1), which contradicts the intuition that we're looking for the smallest N where the condition holds.
