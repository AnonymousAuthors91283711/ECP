theorem P2023AMCB_1 :

Ground Truth Answer: 1/6
Proposed Answer: 1 / 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. First, we calculate the total amount: 3 + (1/3) = 10/3
2. Then we find the target amount (total divided by 4): (10/3)/4 = 10/12 = 5/6
3. The transfer amount is target minus 1/3: 5/6 - 1/3 = 5/6 - 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2
4. Finally, we divide the transfer amount by 3: (1/2)/3 = 1/6

The ground truth answer is indeed 1/6, while the proposed answer is 1/9. These are not equivalent.
