Ground Truth Answer: 341
Proposed Answer: (2^9 - (-1)^9) / 3
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer (2^9 - (-1)^9)/3 evaluates to (512 - (-1))/3 = 513/3 = 171. However, this is not equal to the ground truth answer of 341. But wait, let's re-examine the problem. The iteration count is 10, and the pattern grows exponentially. For n iterations, the number of equal pairs follows a recurrence relation that gives 341 for n=10. The proposed formula seems to be for a different index (perhaps n=9). Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

Correction: After checking the pattern more carefully, the correct formula for n iterations is (2^(n+1) - (-1)^(n+1))/3. For n=10, this gives (2048 - 1)/3 = 2047/3 ≈ 682.333, which still doesn't match 341. Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect.

Final conclusion: <<<False>>>
