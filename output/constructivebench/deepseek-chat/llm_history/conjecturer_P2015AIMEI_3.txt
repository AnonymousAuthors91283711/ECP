From the problem statement, we need to find a prime p such that 16p + 1 is a perfect cube. The enumerated answers suggest looking for small primes satisfying this condition. Testing p=7 gives 16*7+1=113 which isn't a cube, p=13 gives 209 (not cube), p=31 gives 497 (not cube), but p=181 gives 16*181+1=2897 which is 17^3. 

<<<181>>>
