Ground Truth Answer: (fun n : ℕ => ((-1) ^ (n + 1) + (n + 1)) / (n + 2))
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (n + 1) / (n + 2)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding a polynomial P of degree n that satisfies P(k) = k/(k+1) for k = 0,1,...,n, and then evaluating P at n+1.

2. The ground truth answer involves both (-1)^(n+1) and (n+1) terms in the numerator, while the proposed answer only has (n+1).

3. For small test cases:
   - n=0: Ground truth gives (1+1)/2 = 1, proposed gives 1/2
   - n=1: Ground truth gives (-1+2)/3 = 1/3, proposed gives 2/3
   - n=2: Ground truth gives (1+3)/4 = 1, proposed gives 3/4

The answers clearly differ for all these cases, and the pattern shows they are fundamentally different formulas.
