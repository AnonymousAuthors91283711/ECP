abbrev omnimath1559_answer : Set ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath1559 :
  {c : ℤ | ∃ a b : ℤ, a + b * c = 2017 ∧ b + c * a = 8} = omnimath1559_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℤ
Looking at the pattern from enumerated answers and solving the system of equations, the solution set appears to be all integers c where c satisfies (2017 - 8c)/(1 - c²) must be integer. The solutions are c = 0, c = 2, and c = -2.

<<<{0, 2, -2}>>>
