Ground Truth Answer: 403/144
Proposed Answer: 25/4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the sum of reciprocals of all positive divisors of 144.

2. First, we need to find all positive divisors of 144. The prime factorization of 144 is 2^4 * 3^2. The number of divisors is (4+1)(2+1) = 15.

3. The divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 144.

4. Calculating the sum of reciprocals:
1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/8 + 1/9 + 1/12 + 1/16 + 1/18 + 1/24 + 1/36 + 1/48 + 1/72 + 1/144

5. The common denominator is 144. Calculating the numerator:
144 + 72 + 48 + 36 + 24 + 18 + 16 + 12 + 9 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 403

6. Therefore, the correct sum is 403/144.

The proposed answer 25/4 (which equals 900/144) is significantly larger than the correct answer 403/144.
