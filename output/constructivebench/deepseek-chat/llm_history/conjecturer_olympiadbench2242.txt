Looking at the problem and the proposed answer, I notice several issues:
1. The proposed answer has parentheses imbalance and incorrect structure
2. The problem involves solving for k first using the condition f(3)/f(6) = 1/3
3. From hf, we can derive that k must be -1/3 (not 1/3 as in the proposed answer)

The correct answer should compute f(9) - f(3) using k = -1/3:
f(9) - f(3) = (2^(9*(-1/3)) + 9) - (2^(3*(-1/3)) + 9) = (2^(-3) + 9) - (2^(-1) + 9) = (1/8 + 9) - (1/2 + 9) = -3/8

Here's the corrected Lean expression:

Looking at the problem, we need to find the value of f(9) - f(3) given the functional equation and condition. The proposed answer (-3)/8 doesn't match the structure of the problem.

From the given:
1. f(x) = 2^(x*k) + 9
2. f(3)/f(6) = 1/3

First, let's solve for k:
f(3) = 2^(3k) + 9
f(6) = 2^(6k) + 9
f(3)/f(6) = (2^(3k) + 9)/(2^(6k) + 9) = 1/3

Let y = 2^(3k), then:
(y + 9)/(y² + 9) = 1/3
3y + 27 = y² + 9
y² - 3y - 18 = 0
(y - 6)(y + 3) = 0
y = 6 (since y = 2^(3k) > 0)

Thus:
2^(3k) = 6 ⇒ k = (log 6)/(3 log 2)

Now compute f(9) - f(3):
= (2^(9k) + 9) - (2^(3k) + 9)
= 2^(9k) - 2^(3k)
= (2^(3k))³ - 2^(3k)
= 6³ - 6 = 216 - 6 = 210

The correct answer should be 210, not (-3)/8. Here's the Lean expression:

<<<210>>>
