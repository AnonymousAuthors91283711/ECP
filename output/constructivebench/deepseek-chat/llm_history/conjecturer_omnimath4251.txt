The error occurs because `Ico` expects real number bounds but we're passing an integer `n`. We need to cast `n` to ℝ. Here's the corrected version:

<<<{x | ∃ n : ℤ, x ∈ Ico (n : ℝ) (n + 1) ∧ (n ≤ x ∧ x < n + sqrt (n^2 + 2*n + 2))}>>>

Explanation:
1. The error message indicates Lean can't find a membership instance between ℝ and Set ℤ, which happens because we're trying to check if a real `x` is in an interval of integers.
2. The fix is to explicitly cast the integer `n` to a real number using `(n : ℝ)` when creating the interval.
3. The condition `n ≤ x ∧ x < n + sqrt (n^2 + 2*n + 2)` remains unchanged as it already properly compares reals.
4. The pattern from the problem suggests we're looking for x in intervals [n, n+1) where n is an integer, with an additional constraint involving the square root term.
