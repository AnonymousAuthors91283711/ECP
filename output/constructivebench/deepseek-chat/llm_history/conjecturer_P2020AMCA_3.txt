The error occurs because the proposed answer is trying to use variables `t, v, p, g, c` that are defined inside the theorem but aren't available in the global scope where `P2020AMCA_3_answer` is defined. The answer should be a concrete real number calculated from the given constants.

Looking at the problem:
- t = 2 (hours)
- v = 60 (mph)
- p = 0.5 (dollars per mile)
- g = 30 (mpg)
- c = 2 (dollars per gallon)

The calculation is:
1. miles = t * v = 2 * 60 = 120
2. gallons = miles / g = 120 / 30 = 4
3. pay = miles * p = 120 * 0.5 = 60
4. expenses = gallons * c = 4 * 2 = 8
5. Final answer = (pay - expenses) / t = (60 - 8) / 2 = 26

<<<(26 : ℝ)>>>

Explanation:
The answer is simply the numeric result of the calculation using the given constants. The error occurred because the original attempt tried to use variables that weren't in scope. The correct approach is to compute the final value (26) and present it as a real number in Lean.
