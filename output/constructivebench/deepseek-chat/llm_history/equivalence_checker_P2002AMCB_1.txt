theorem P2002AMCB_1 :
  let numbers := List.range 9 |>.map fun n => 10^(n + 1) - 1
  let M := numbers.sum / 9
  (List.length (digits 10 M) = 9) ∧
  (∀ d ∈ digits 10 M, (digits 10 M).count d = 1) ∧
  ¬(P2002AMCB_1_answer ∈ digits 10 M) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 0
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves creating a number M by summing numbers of form 10^(n+1)-1 for n from 0 to 8, then dividing by 9. This gives M = 123456789.

2. The digits of M are [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], each appearing exactly once.

3. The theorem states that P2002AMCB_1_answer should be a digit NOT present in M.

4. The ground truth answer is 0, which is indeed not in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].

5. The proposed answer is 8, which IS present in M's digits.

The proposed answer violates the theorem's condition that P2002AMCB_1_answer should not be in the digits of M.
