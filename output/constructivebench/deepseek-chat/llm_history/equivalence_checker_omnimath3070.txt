Ground Truth Answer: -5
Proposed Answer: -2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us the equation: m + 1 = (n - 2)/3
2. We need to find the value of 3m - n

Let's solve it step by step:

Starting with the given equation:
m + 1 = (n - 2)/3

Multiply both sides by 3:
3(m + 1) = n - 2
3m + 3 = n - 2

Now rearrange to get 3m - n:
3m - n = -2 - 3
3m - n = -5

The ground truth answer is -5, which matches our calculation.
The proposed answer is -2, which is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
