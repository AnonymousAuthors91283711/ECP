theorem omnimath2534
(h a r v m i t : ℝ)
(hard : h * a * r * v * a * r * d = 100 ∧ m * i * t = 100 ∧ h * m * m * t = 100)
: (r * a * d) * (t * r * i * v * i * a) = omnimath2534_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the enumerated answers and the given equations, we can observe that:
1. The product of all variables (h*a*r*v*a*r*d*m*i*t) is 10000 (from first two equations multiplied)
2. The third equation gives h*m²*t = 100
3. We can solve for (r*a*d)*(t*r*i*v*i*a) by dividing the total product by h*m²*t

The final answer simplifies to 100. 

<<<100>>>
