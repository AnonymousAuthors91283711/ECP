theorem P2000AIMEII_1 : 
  ∃ m n : ℕ, 0 < m ∧ 0 < n ∧ Coprime m n ∧ m/n = 2/5 + 8/25 ∧ m + n = P2000AIMEII_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the equation m/n = 2/5 + 8/25 = 18/25, we see m=18k and n=25k for some k where Coprime 18 25 holds. The smallest solution (k=1) gives m+n=43. The enumerated answers confirm this pattern.

<<<43>>>
