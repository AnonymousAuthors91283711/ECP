Looking at the problem, we need to find the minimal sum of squares of two subset sums where we partition the set [-7, -5, -3, -2, 2, 4, 6, 13] into two 4-element subsets. The enumerated answers show the minimal sum occurs when the subsets are [-7,6,4,2] and [13,-5,-3,-2], giving sums 5 and 3 respectively, and 5² + 3² = 34.
