Looking at the problem, we're dealing with a trigonometric sum involving cosine terms in the denominator. The proposed answer suggests a telescoping pattern that simplifies to a tangent function divided by sine. The error occurs because Lean needs explicit type annotations for division operations involving real numbers.

The key observations:
1. The sum involves consecutive angles in degrees converted to radians (πk/180)
2. The pattern suggests using trigonometric identities to telescope the sum
3. The enumerated answers hint at a final form involving cotangent or tangent

The correct form should use proper real number division and parentheses for clarity. Here's the fixed version:

<<<(1 / (sin (π / 180))) * tan (π * 89 / 180)>>>

Explanation:
1. Added parentheses around the denominator (sin (π / 180)) to ensure proper division
2. Maintained the structure of the original proposed answer which matches the telescoping pattern
3. The form 1/sinθ * tan(89θ) is typical for sums of secant-like terms through trigonometric identities
4. The angle 89° appears because we're summing from k=0 to 88 (89 terms total)
