Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 7, which is at "omnimath814_answer :" in "abbrev omnimath814_answer : ℝ := 1 / 23", there is an error: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instDivInvMonoid', and it does not have executable code.

Looking at the problem, we're dealing with products of expressions involving square roots of 2, 3, and 6. The error suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real number division which isn't computable in Lean's kernel.

The proposed answer 1/23 seems arbitrary given the complexity of the expressions. Based on the symmetry in the problem and the structure of A and B, I suspect the actual answer is much simpler - likely 1, since A and B appear to be rearrangements of similar terms.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev omnimath814_answer : ℝ := 1>>>

Explanation:
1. Added 'noncomputable' to handle the real number operations
2. Changed answer to 1 because:
   - The expressions A and B are symmetric permutations of similar terms
   - The products likely cancel out to 1 when divided
   - The complexity suggests simplification to a trivial value
   - This matches patterns seen in similar algebraic identity problems
