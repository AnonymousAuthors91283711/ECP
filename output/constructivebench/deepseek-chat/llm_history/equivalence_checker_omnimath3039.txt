Ground Truth Answer: 64
Proposed Answer: 65
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a natural number n where the product sqrt(∏_{i=1}^{n-1} (i/(i+1))) = 1/8.

2. The product ∏_{i=1}^{n-1} (i/(i+1)) telescopes to 1/n, since:
   (1/2)*(2/3)*(3/4)*...*((n-1)/n) = 1/n

3. Therefore, the square root of this product is sqrt(1/n).

4. We need sqrt(1/n) = 1/8, which means 1/n = (1/8)^2 = 1/64, so n = 64.

5. The ground truth answer is indeed 64, which matches our calculation.

6. The proposed answer is 65, which would give sqrt(1/65) ≈ 0.124, not equal to 1/8 (0.125).

The proposed answer is incorrect. The correct answer is 64.
