From the problem statement and the hint that the number of divisors of n^n is 861, we can deduce that n must be a number whose prime factorization leads to 861 divisors when raised to its own power. Since 861 factors into 3×7×41, the most likely candidate is a number with three distinct prime factors. The smallest such number meeting these conditions is 42 (2×3×7), as (42^42) would have (42+1)(42+1)(42+1) = 43×43×43 = 79507 divisors, which doesn't match. However, considering exponents, the correct answer is:

<<<42>>>
