Ground Truth Answer: 1 / 2
Proposed Answer: (3/4 : ℚ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal rational number q such that for all integers r,s satisfying:
   - 3r ≥ 2s - 3
   - 4s ≥ r + 12
   we have r/s ≥ q

2. The ground truth answer is 1/2
3. The proposed answer is 3/4

To check equivalence, let's test if 3/4 satisfies the conditions:

Test case 1: r=3, s=6
- 3*3 ≥ 2*6 - 3 → 9 ≥ 9 (true)
- 4*6 ≥ 3 + 12 → 24 ≥ 15 (true)
- r/s = 3/6 = 1/2 < 3/4
This violates the first condition since we found r,s where the inequalities hold but r/s < 3/4.

Therefore, 3/4 cannot be the correct minimal bound since there exist valid r,s pairs that give a smaller ratio. The correct minimal bound is indeed 1/2.
