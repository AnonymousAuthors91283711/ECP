theorem omnimath246 (m n : ℕ) (h : m ≥ n) :
    (m + n)! / (m - n)! = omnimath246_answer m n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
Looking at the pattern from enumerated answers (m=2,n=1→6; m=3,n=1→24; m=3,n=2→120; m=4,n=2→720), we observe it matches rising factorials. The solution is the Pochhammer function (m+1)_n * m! where (x)_n is the rising factorial.
