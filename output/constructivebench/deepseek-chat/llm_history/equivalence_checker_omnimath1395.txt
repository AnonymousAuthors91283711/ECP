Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1), (2, 2^2017)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b) | ∃ k, (k ∣ 2017) ∧ (b = a^k ∨ a = b^k)}
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem asks for pairs (a,b) where a*b divides a^2017 + b. The ground truth gives two specific pairs, while the proposed answer gives a general form.

Looking at the ground truth:
1. (1,1): 1*1 divides 1^2017 + 1 = 2 (false, but 1 divides everything)
2. (2,2^2017): 2*2^2017 divides 2^2017 + 2^2017 = 2^(2017+1) (true)

The proposed answer claims all solutions are of form where either b = a^k or a = b^k with k dividing 2017. 

2017 is prime, so k can only be 1 or 2017.

For k=1: b = a or a = b → (a,a) pairs. Only (1,1) works from ground truth.
For k=2017: b = a^2017 or a = b^2017 → (2,2^2017) matches the first case.

However, the proposed answer misses that (1,1) is a special case that doesn't fit the general form (since 1^2017 = 1 for any k). Also, it doesn't exclude other possibilities that might satisfy the condition.

The proposed answer captures the main cases but isn't complete/exact compared to the ground truth.
