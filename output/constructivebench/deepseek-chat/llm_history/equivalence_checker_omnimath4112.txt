Ground Truth Answer: {fun x : ℝ => 1 / 2, fun x : ℝ => 0, fun x : ℝ => x ^ 2}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℝ, f = fun x => c + 1} ∪ {f | f = fun _ => 0} ∪ {f | f = fun x => x}
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem is asking for all real-valued functions f:ℝ→ℝ that satisfy the functional equation:
   f(x²) + f(2y²) = (f(x+y) + f(y)) * (f(x-y) + f(y)) for all x,y ∈ ℝ

2. Ground truth gives three specific solutions:
   - Constant function 0
   - Constant function 1/2
   - Quadratic function x ↦ x²

3. Proposed answer suggests:
   - All constant functions f(x) = c + 1
   - The zero function f(x) = 0
   - The identity function f(x) = x

Analysis:
- The zero function is correct (matches ground truth)
- The identity function f(x) = x does NOT satisfy the equation (test with x=1,y=0 gives 1+0 = (1+0)*(1+0) which is correct, but x=2,y=1 gives 4+2 = (3+1)*(1+1) ⇒ 6=8 which is false)
- The constant functions f(x) = c + 1: only c = -1/2 (giving f(x) = 1/2) works, others don't
- The quadratic solution x² is missing from proposed answer

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect as it includes wrong solutions (identity function and most constant functions) and misses a correct solution (quadratic).
