  ∃! x, x * ⌊x * ⌊x * ⌊x * ⌊x⌋⌋⌋⌋ = 122 ∧ x = omnimath3360_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<3>>>

Explanation: The problem asks for a unique real number x satisfying the nested floor equation. The enumerated answer suggests x=3 is the solution, as it satisfies 3 * floor(3 * floor(3 * floor(3 * floor(3)))) = 122 when computed step-by-step.
