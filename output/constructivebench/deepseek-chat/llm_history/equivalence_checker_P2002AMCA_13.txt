Ground Truth Answer: Real.sqrt 5
Proposed Answer: (1 + Real.sqrt 5) / 2 + (1 - Real.sqrt 5) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two positive real numbers a and b that satisfy:
   - a - 1 = 1/a
   - b - 1 = 1/b
   - a ≠ b

2. We can rewrite the equations as quadratic equations:
   a² - a - 1 = 0
   b² - b - 1 = 0

3. The solutions to x² - x - 1 = 0 are:
   (1 + √5)/2 and (1 - √5)/2

4. The ground truth answer is √5, which would be the sum of these two roots:
   (1 + √5)/2 + (1 - √5)/2 = (1 + √5 + 1 - √5)/2 = 2/2 = 1

5. However, the proposed answer is exactly this sum (1 + √5)/2 + (1 - √5)/2, which simplifies to 1, not √5.

The proposed answer is the expression that sums to 1, while the ground truth is √5. These are clearly different.
