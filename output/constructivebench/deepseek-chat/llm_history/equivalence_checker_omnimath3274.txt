Ground Truth Answer: 11
Proposed Answer: 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We're given the equation (x - y)/(z - y) = -10
2. We need to find the value of (x - z)/(y - z)

Let's solve it step by step:

From the given equation:
(x - y)/(z - y) = -10
=> x - y = -10(z - y)
=> x - y = -10z + 10y
=> x = -10z + 11y

Now compute (x - z)/(y - z):
= (-10z + 11y - z)/(y - z)
= (-11z + 11y)/(y - z)
= 11(y - z)/(y - z)
= 11 (when y ≠ z)

The ground truth answer is 11, which matches our derivation. The proposed answer is 9, which is incorrect.
