Looking at the problem statement and the error message, we need to find a real number x that satisfies:
1. log₂(log₂(2x - 2)) = 2
2. 2x - 2 > 0
3. log₂(2x - 2) > 0

The proposed answer (2^(2^2) + 2)/2 has the right structure but needs to be properly expressed in Lean. The error suggests we need to mark it as noncomputable since it involves real number operations.

From the logarithmic equation:
log₂(log₂(2x - 2)) = 2 ⇒ log₂(2x - 2) = 2^2 = 4 ⇒ 2x - 2 = 2^4 = 16 ⇒ x = (16 + 2)/2 = 9

This satisfies all conditions:
1. 2*9 - 2 = 16 > 0
2. log₂(16) = 4 > 0
3. log₂(log₂(16)) = log₂4 = 2

Here's the corrected Lean expression:

Looking at the problem statement, we need to find a real number x such that:
1. log₂(log₂(2x - 2)) = 2
2. 2x - 2 > 0
3. log₂(2x - 2) > 0

From the first condition:
log₂(log₂(2x - 2)) = 2 ⇒ log₂(2x - 2) = 2² = 4 ⇒ 2x - 2 = 2⁴ = 16 ⇒ 2x = 18 ⇒ x = 9

This satisfies all conditions:
1. 2*9 - 2 = 16 > 0
2. log₂(16) = 4 > 0

The error in the original proposed answer was likely due to using a non-computable operation. The correct answer is simply 9.
