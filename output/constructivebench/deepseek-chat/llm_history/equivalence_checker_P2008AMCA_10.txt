noncomputable abbrev P2008AMCA_10_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem P2008AMCA_10 (t : ℝ) :
  (1/5 + 1/7) * (t - 1) = 1 ↔ P2008AMCA_10_answer t = 1 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun t => (1/5 + 1/7) * (t - 1)
Proposed Answer: fun t : ℝ => (t - 1) / (12 / 35)
Let's analyze the equivalence:

1. The ground truth answer is: (1/5 + 1/7) * (t - 1)
2. The proposed answer is: (t - 1) / (12/35)

First, let's simplify the ground truth:
1/5 + 1/7 = 7/35 + 5/35 = 12/35
So ground truth becomes: (12/35) * (t - 1)

Now look at the proposed answer:
(t - 1) / (12/35) = (t - 1) * (35/12) = (35/12) * (t - 1)

This is clearly different from (12/35) * (t - 1) unless t=1 (where both equal 0), but the problem asks about general equivalence.
