Ground Truth Answer: {a | Odd a}
Proposed Answer: {a | ∃ k, a = 2^k - 1}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding for which positive natural numbers 'a' the function f(x) = x XOR (a*x) is injective (distinct inputs give distinct outputs).

2. The ground truth states this holds when 'a' is odd.

3. The proposed answer suggests it holds when 'a' is one less than a power of 2 (numbers like 1, 3, 7, 15,...).

Observation:
- All numbers of the form 2^k - 1 are indeed odd (since they're all 1 less than even numbers).
- However, there are many odd numbers not of this form (like 5, 9, 11, etc.).

The proposed answer is a proper subset of the ground truth. It correctly identifies some cases where the condition holds, but misses others. Therefore:

<<<False>>>
