theorem olympiadbench2289 (θ : ℝ) :
  θ ∈ Icc 0 (2*π) ∧ (fun a => 2*a^2 - 3*a + 1) (logb (1/2) (sin θ)) = 0 ↔ θ ∈ olympiadbench2289_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {π/6, 5*π/6, π/4, 3*π/4}
Proposed Answer: ⋃ k ∈ ({0,1,2,3,4,5} : Finset ℕ), {π/6 + 2*k*π/6, 5*π/6 + 2*k*π/6}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is solving the equation 2(logb(1/2)(sin θ))² - 3(logb(1/2)(sin θ)) + 1 = 0 for θ ∈ [0, 2π]

2. The ground truth gives the solutions within one period [0, 2π]

3. The proposed answer gives:
   - All solutions of form π/6 + kπ/3 and 5π/6 + kπ/3 for k ∈ {0,1,2,3,4,5}
   - This includes periodic extensions beyond [0, 2π] (like 13π/6 when k=2)
   - Also includes duplicates (π/6 appears twice: when k=0 and k=3)

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It includes values outside the specified interval [0, 2π]
2. It includes duplicate solutions
3. It's missing π/4 and 3π/4 which are valid solutions
