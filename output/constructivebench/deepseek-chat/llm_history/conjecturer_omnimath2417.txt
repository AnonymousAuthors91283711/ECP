theorem omnimath2417 :
  (∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 99, (n ^ 3 + 3 * n ^ 2 + 3 * n) = omnimath2417_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern of the summand (n³ + 3n² + 3n), we recognize it as (n+1)³ - 1. The sum from 1 to 99 then telescopes to (100³ - 1) - 99 = 100³ - 100.
