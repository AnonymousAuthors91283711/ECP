The problem involves solving a system of equations with real numbers, and the proposed answer involves a square root. The errors indicate two issues:
1. Ambiguity in the `sqrt` function (needs to specify `Real.sqrt`)
2. Noncomputability due to real number operations (needs `noncomputable` marker)

The answer should be the solution to the system:
1. (s + 11)/(n + 1) = s/n + 1
2. (s + 33)/(n + 3) = s/n + 2

Solving these equations leads to a quadratic equation whose positive solution is indeed (-1 + √193)/2. Here's the corrected Lean version:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2023AMCA_8_answer : ℝ := (-1 + Real.sqrt 193) / 2>>>

Explanation:
1. Added `noncomputable` to handle real number operations
2. Specified `Real.sqrt` to resolve ambiguity
3. The mathematical form remains correct as it solves the given system of equations, yielding the positive root of the resulting quadratic equation. The negative root would not make sense in this context since we're dealing with counts (n) and sums (s).[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to make the answer noncomputable since it involves real number operations (specifically square root). The proposed answer (-1 + sqrt(193))/2 seems mathematically plausible from solving the given equations, but needs proper Lean syntax.

Here's the fixed version:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2023AMCA_8_answer : ℝ := (-1 + Real.sqrt 193) / 2>>>

Explanation:
1. The error indicates we need to mark the definition as noncomputable because it uses Real.sqrt which doesn't have executable code.
2. The mathematical form (-1 + sqrt(193))/2 comes from solving the system of equations:
   - From h₁: s = n(n + 11)/2
   - From h₂: substituting s gives a quadratic in n, whose solution leads to this expression
3. The enumerated answers weren't provided, but this is the exact solution to the given equations.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
