Looking at the pattern from the enumerated answers (which would be {10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15} based on the equation), we can see that the set has 6 distinct values. The equation represents all possible combinations of 2-point and 3-point problems with k being the number of 3-point problems (0 ≤ k ≤ 5). For each k from 0 to 5, we get a unique total.
