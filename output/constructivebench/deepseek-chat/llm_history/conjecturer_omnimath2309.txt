noncomputable abbrev omnimath2309_answer : ℕ → ℕ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2309 (x y : ℕ) (hx : x ≤ 5) (hy : y ≤ 5) :
  let total_paths := Nat.choose 10 5
  let blocked_paths := Nat.choose (x + y) x * Nat.choose (10 - x - y) (5 - x)
  (total_paths - blocked_paths : ℝ) / 36 = omnimath2309_answer x y := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ → ℝ
