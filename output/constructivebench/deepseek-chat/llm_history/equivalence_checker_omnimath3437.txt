Ground Truth Answer: 36
Proposed Answer: 19
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a set S of natural numbers p that can be expressed as 2*(a+b) where a and b are positive integers with a*b=24.

2. We need to find a number that is:
   - Not in S (omnimath3437_answer ∉ S)
   - The only natural number not in S (∀ p : ℕ, p ∉ S → p = omnimath3437_answer)

3. First, let's find all possible pairs (a,b) with a*b=24 and a,b>0:
   (1,24), (2,12), (3,8), (4,6), (6,4), (8,3), (12,2), (24,1)

4. Calculate p=2*(a+b) for each:
   50, 28, 22, 20, 20, 22, 28, 50

5. The set S is {20, 22, 28, 50}

6. The smallest natural number not in S is 19 (assuming we're considering numbers ≥19), but 21, 23, etc. are also not in S, so 19 isn't the only one missing.

7. The ground truth answer is 36, which is indeed not in S, but there are many other numbers not in S (like 19, 21, etc.), so neither answer satisfies the uniqueness condition.
