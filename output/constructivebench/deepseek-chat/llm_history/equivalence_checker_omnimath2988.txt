abbrev omnimath2988_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2988 (x : ℝ) :
  x / 90 - x / 120 = 16 / 60 ↔ x = omnimath2988_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 96
Proposed Answer: 1152
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation given is: x/90 - x/120 = 16/60
2. To solve this, we find a common denominator for the left side (360):
   (4x - 3x)/360 = 16/60
   x/360 = 16/60
3. Solving for x:
   x = (16/60)*360
   x = (16*6) = 96

The ground truth answer is 96, which is correct. The proposed answer is 1152, which is incorrect (it's 12 times larger than the correct answer).
