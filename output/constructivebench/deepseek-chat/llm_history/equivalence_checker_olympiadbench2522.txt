Ground Truth Answer: 50
Proposed Answer: 45
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a scenario with two speeds (paddle=7, swim=2) and total time=1.5 hours (90 minutes).
2. We need to find times t₁ and t₂ that satisfy several conditions about distances covered.
3. The final answer represents some time difference converted from hours to minutes (divided by 60).
4. The ground truth is 50 minutes, while the proposed answer is 45 minutes.

The difference between 50 and 45 is significant (10% difference) and doesn't appear to be just a rounding error or minor miscalculation. The proposed answer of 45 doesn't match the ground truth of 50.
