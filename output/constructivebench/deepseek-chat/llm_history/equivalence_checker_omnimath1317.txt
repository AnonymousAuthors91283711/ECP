theorem omnimath1317 (x : ℝ) (hx1 : x ≠ -2) (hx2 : x ≠ -9/2) :

Ground Truth Answer: Icc (-9/2) (-2) ∪ Ioo ((1 - sqrt 5)/2) ((1 + sqrt 5)/2)
Proposed Answer: Iio (-9/2) ∪ Ioo (-2) (1/2) ∪ Ioi 5
Let me analyze the problem and compare the answers:

1. The problem is solving the inequality (x+1)/(x+2) > (3x+4)/(2x+9) with conditions x ≠ -2 and x ≠ -9/2.

2. The ground truth answer correctly identifies:
   - The interval between -9/2 and -2 where the inequality holds (Icc (-9/2) (-2))
   - The interval between the roots of the quadratic equation obtained when solving the inequality (Ioo ((1 - sqrt 5)/2) ((1 + sqrt 5)/2))

3. The proposed answer is incorrect because:
   - It suggests the inequality holds for x < -9/2 (Iio (-9/2)), which is false
   - It suggests the inequality holds for x > -2 (Ioo (-2) (1/2) ∪ Ioi 5), which is incomplete and partially incorrect
   - It misses the correct interval between -9/2 and -2
   - The values 1/2 and 5 are not relevant to the solution

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth and contains significant errors.

<<<False>>>
