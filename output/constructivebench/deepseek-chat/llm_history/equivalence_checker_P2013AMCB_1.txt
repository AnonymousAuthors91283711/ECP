abbrev P2013AMCB_1_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2013AMCB_1 :
  ∃! (low : ℝ), 
    let high := low + 16
    (high + low) / 2 = 3 ∧ low = P2013AMCB_1_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: -5
Proposed Answer: (-10)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem states we need to find a unique real number `low` such that:
   - `high = low + 16`
   - The average of `high` and `low` is 3
   - `low` equals some predefined answer

2. The average condition gives us:
   (high + low)/2 = 3
   => (low + 16 + low)/2 = 3
   => (2low + 16)/2 = 3
   => low + 8 = 3
   => low = 3 - 8 = -5

3. The ground truth answer is indeed -5, which matches our calculation.

4. The proposed answer is -10, which doesn't satisfy the equation:
   If low = -10, then high = 6
   Average would be (-10 + 6)/2 = -2 ≠ 3

<<<False>>>
