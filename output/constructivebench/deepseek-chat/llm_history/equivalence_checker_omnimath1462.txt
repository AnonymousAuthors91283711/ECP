Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 1
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. This is a recurrence relation problem with given initial conditions and a constraint (a98 = a99).

2. The recurrence relation is a(n+3) = a(n+2) - 2a(n+1) + a(n), which is a linear recurrence with characteristic equation r³ - r² + 2r - 1 = 0.

3. The ground truth answer is 3, which comes from carefully solving the recurrence and summing the terms.

4. The proposed answer is 1, which doesn't match the ground truth.

The proposed answer is incorrect based on the given information and the correct solution to this recurrence problem.

<<<False>>>
