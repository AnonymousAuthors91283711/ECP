Based on the problem statement, we need to find the bike time multiplied by 60 (converting hours to minutes). Let's analyze the given equations:

1. We have swim_speed > 0
2. run_speed = 5 * swim_speed
3. bike_speed = 2 * run_speed = 10 * swim_speed
4. Total time equation: (0.5/swim_speed) + (30/bike_speed) + (8/run_speed) = 4.25

Substituting the speed relationships:
(0.5/swim_speed) + (30/(10*swim_speed)) + (8/(5*swim_speed)) = 4.25

Solving for swim_speed gives swim_speed = 1/3 km/min
Then bike_time = 30/(10*(1/3)) = 9 hours
But bike_time * 60 = 9 * 60 = 540 minutes

However, looking at the error and the proposed answer 10/3, it seems we need to mark it as noncomputable since it involves real numbers. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2013AIMEI_1_answer : ℝ := 540>>> 

Explanation: The correct answer is 540 minutes after solving the system of equations. The error was due to needing to mark real number computations as noncomputable in Lean. The proposed answer 10/3 was incorrect - the actual solution involves converting the bike time (9 hours) to minutes (540).
