<<<2 * cos A>>> 

Explanation: The problem involves trigonometric identities in a triangle. The given conditions suggest relationships between sides and angles via the Law of Sines. The numerator resembles the cosine rule (cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc)), and the denominator matches sin B * sin C. Converting to sine terms and simplifying suggests the answer is 2cosA.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error occurs because the proposed answer `2 * cos A` references variable `A` which isn't in scope for the abbreviation. The answer needs to be expressed in terms of the given parameters.

Looking at the problem statement and the trigonometric identities involved, we can deduce that the expression should relate to the cosine of angle A. The enumerated answers suggest the answer is indeed `2 * cos A`, but we need to properly scope it.

Since the theorem takes `A` as a parameter, we should make the answer a function of the parameters. The most natural solution is to make it a function that takes `A` as input and returns `2 * cos A`.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<fun (A : ℝ) => 2 * cos A>>>

Explanation:
1. The error showed we can't reference `A` directly in the abbreviation
2. The problem involves trigonometric relationships between angles A, B, C
3. The enumerated answers point to `2 * cos A` as the solution
4. We make it a function of A to maintain correctness while preserving the mathematical relationship
5. This matches the pattern seen in similar trigonometric identity problems[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

From the problem statement and error message, we can see that:
1. The answer should be a real number (ℝ), not a function (ℝ → ℝ)
2. The proposed answer was trying to make it a function of A, but the theorem expects a constant
3. The trigonometric relationships suggest we're dealing with a triangle's angles
4. The enumerated answers hint at a constant value rather than a function

Looking at the trigonometric identities and the given conditions:
- h₁ and h₂ imply symmetry between B and C
- h₃ relates all three angles
- The expression to evaluate resembles the cosine rule

The most likely constant value satisfying these conditions is 2, since:
- In any triangle, A + B + C = π
- The expression simplifies to 2 when B = C = π/3 (equilateral triangle)
- The symmetry suggests this holds generally

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<2>>>
