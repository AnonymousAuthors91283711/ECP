Looking at the problem, we need to find the smallest positive x where f(x) = f(2001) for a function f satisfying given conditions. The functional equation f(3x) = 3f(x) suggests a scaling property, and the piecewise definition on [1,3] gives us a base case.

The enumerated answer hint is 2001/3^6, which equals 2001/729 ≈ 2.745. This suggests we need to scale down 2001 by powers of 3 until it falls into the interval [1,3], where f is defined.

Here's the corrected answer with noncomputable annotation since it involves real division:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2001AIMEII_8_answer : ℝ := 2001 / 3^6>>>

Explanation:
1. The function f has a scaling property f(3x) = 3f(x)
2. We need to find x where f(x) = f(2001)
3. First scale down 2001 by dividing by 3 until it falls in [1,3]:
   - 2001/3^6 ≈ 2.745 ∈ [1,3]
4. The smallest positive x would be this scaled-down value, as larger x would require more scaling and thus be larger numbers.

The answer maintains the functional relationship while being the minimal positive solution.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The enumerated answer 2001/3^6 suggests the solution involves dividing 2001 by a power of 3. The error occurs because real division in Lean needs to be marked as noncomputable. The pattern shows we're reducing 2001 by dividing by 3 until it falls into the base interval [1,3].

Here's the fixed answer with noncomputable annotation:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2001AIMEII_8_answer : ℝ := 2001 / 3^6>>>

Explanation:
1. The function f has scaling behavior f(3x) = 3f(x)
2. We need to reduce 2001 to the base interval [1,3] where f is defined
3. Dividing 2001 by 3^6 = 729 gives ≈2.745 which is in [1,3]
4. This is the minimal x because any higher power would make x < 1
