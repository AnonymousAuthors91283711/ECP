abbrev P2003AMCA_19_answer : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem P2003AMCA_19 (a b c : ℝ) (ha : a ≠ 0) :
  (let f := fun x => a*(x-5)^2 + b*(x-5) + c
   let g := fun x => -a*(x+5)^2 - b*(x+5) - c
   (f + g) = P2003AMCA_19_answer a b c) ∧ 
  10 * b ≠ 0 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a b c x => 10 * b * x + (50 * b + 2 * c)
Proposed Answer: fun a b c x => 2 * a * x ^ 2 + (2 * c - 50 * a)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines two functions f and g, then asks for their sum (f + g).
2. f(x) = a*(x-5)² + b*(x-5) + c
3. g(x) = -a*(x+5)² - b*(x+5) - c
4. Let's compute f(x) + g(x):

f(x) + g(x) = [a(x²-10x+25) + b(x-5) + c] + [-a(x²+10x+25) - b(x+5) - c]
            = ax² - 10ax + 25a + bx - 5b + c - ax² - 10ax - 25a - bx - 5b - c
            = (-10ax - 10ax) + (bx - bx) + (25a - 25a) + (-5b - 5b) + (c - c)
            = -20ax - 10b

The ground truth answer is 10*b*x + (50*b + 2*c), which doesn't match our computation.
The proposed answer is 2*a*x² + (2*c - 50*a), which also doesn't match our computation.

However, the ground truth answer seems to be incorrect based on our computation, while the proposed answer is also incorrect but in a different way.
