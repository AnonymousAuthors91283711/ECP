Ground Truth Answer: (-7) / 16
Proposed Answer: 5 / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the sum of squares of all distinct roots of a given 10th degree polynomial.

2. The ground truth answer is -7/16 (-0.4375) while the proposed answer is 5/2 (2.5).

3. To verify, we can use Vieta's formulas. For a polynomial p(X) = aₙXⁿ + ... + a₀, the sum of roots is -a_{n-1}/aₙ and the sum of products of roots two at a time is a_{n-2}/aₙ.

4. For our polynomial p(X) = 4X¹⁰ - 7X⁹ + ..., the sum of roots is 7/4 and the sum of products is 5/4.

5. The sum of squares of roots is (sum of roots)² - 2*(sum of products) = (7/4)² - 2*(5/4) = 49/16 - 10/4 = 49/16 - 40/16 = 9/16.

6. However, the problem asks for the sum of squares of distinct roots, which would be different if there are multiple roots. But the polynomial appears to have distinct roots (though this would need verification).

7. The ground truth answer (-7/16) doesn't match our calculation (9/16), but neither does the proposed answer (5/2).

Given that neither answer matches our calculation and they don't match each other, and considering the complexity of verifying distinct roots, the most accurate assessment is:

<<<False>>>
