Ground Truth Answer: fun _ => 1/12
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n = 1 then 0 else (1/4)^4 - (1/4)^5 + (3/4)^4 - (3/4)^5
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum value of the expression ∑(x_j^4 - x_j^5) under the constraints that all x_j ≥ 0 and ∑x_j = 1.

2. The ground truth answer claims the maximum is always 1/12 ≈ 0.0833 regardless of n.

3. The proposed answer gives:
   - 0 for n=1 (which is correct since x must be [1], giving 1^4-1^5=0)
   - For n≥2, it suggests using x = [1/4, 3/4, 0, ..., 0], yielding (1/4)^4 - (1/4)^5 + (3/4)^4 - (3/4)^5 ≈ 0.0791

The proposed answer is close but not exactly equal to the ground truth. The maximum is actually achieved at different points (approximately x ≈ 0.28 and x ≈ 0.72), giving the higher value of 1/12.
