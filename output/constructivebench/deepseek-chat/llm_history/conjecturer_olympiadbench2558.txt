Looking at the recurrence relation and initial conditions:
1. t₁ = 1
2. t₂ = -1
3. tₙ = ((n-3)/(n-1)) * tₙ₋₂ for n ≥ 3

The pattern suggests terms alternate between positive and negative, with denominators growing as products of odd numbers. For even n=2k, the term seems to be (-1)^k / (2k-1). For n=1998 (even), k=999, so the answer should be (-1)^999 / 1997 = -1/1997.

The Lean error occurs because we need parentheses around the division expression. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<(-1 : ℚ) / 1997>>>

Explanation:
1. The recurrence relation creates a telescoping product for even terms
2. For even n=2k, the solution simplifies to tₙ = (-1)^k / (2k-1)
3. For n=1998, k=999, giving (-1)^999/1997 = -1/1997
4. In Lean, we need to specify -1 as a ℚ to ensure division works properly
5. Parentheses are needed around the division operation
