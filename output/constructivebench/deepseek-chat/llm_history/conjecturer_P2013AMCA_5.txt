abbrev P2013AMCA_5_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2013AMCA_5 : 
  let total := 105 + 125 + 175
  let share := total / 3
  let t := share - 105
  let d := share - 125
  t - d = P2013AMCA_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the problem statement, we can see it's about dividing a total amount (105+125+175) equally among 3 parties and finding the difference between two adjustments (t and d). The enumerated answers suggest the solution is simply the difference between the original amounts (125-105).
