Ground Truth Answer: {6, 66, 946}
Proposed Answer: {n | n = 1 ∨ (n = 2 ∨ ∃ k : ℕ, n = 2 * (2 ^ k + 1))}
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem asks for all natural numbers n < 100 where n divides (2^n + 2). The ground truth gives specific numbers {6, 66, 946} that satisfy this condition.

The proposed answer attempts to give a general form for such numbers:
1. n = 1
2. n = 2
3. n = 2*(2^k + 1) for some k

Let's check:
- For n=1: 2^1+2=4 is divisible by 1 (valid)
- For n=2: 2^2+2=6 is divisible by 2 (valid)
- For n=6 (k=1): 2*(2^1+1)=6 (matches ground truth)
- For n=66 (k=5): 2*(2^5+1)=66 (matches ground truth)
- For n=946 (k=9): 2*(2^9+1)=1026 ≠ 946 (doesn't match)

The proposed form works for 6 and 66 but fails for 946. Also, the proposed form would generate many other numbers (like 10, 18, 34, etc.) that don't appear in the ground truth (because they don't satisfy n < 100 ∧ (n ∣ 2^n + 2)).
