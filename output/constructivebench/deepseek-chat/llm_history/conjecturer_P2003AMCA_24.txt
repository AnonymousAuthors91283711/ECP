theorem P2003AMCA_24 (a b : ℝ) (hab : a ≥ b ∧ b > 1) :
  IsGreatest {x : ℝ | x = logb a (a / b) + logb b (b / a)} (P2003AMCA_24_answer a b) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
Looking at the pattern from enumerated answers and considering the symmetry in the problem, the solution likely simplifies to a constant value regardless of a and b (as long as they satisfy the conditions). The expression logb a (a/b) + logb b (b/a) can be simplified using logarithm properties.
