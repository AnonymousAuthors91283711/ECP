Ground Truth Answer: 2 * (X + C 4) * (X - C 4) * (X - C 8)
Proposed Answer: C 210 + C 42 * X + C (-14) * X ^ 2 + C 2 * X ^ 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a polynomial p(x) that satisfies two conditions:
   - A functional equation involving p evaluated at different points
   - A specific value p(1) = 210

2. The ground truth answer is a factored form: 2*(X+4)*(X-4)*(X-8)

3. The proposed answer is in expanded form: 210 + 42X - 14X² + 2X³

Let's check if they are equivalent by expanding the ground truth:
2*(X+4)*(X-4)*(X-8) = 2*(X²-16)*(X-8) = 2*(X³-8X²-16X+128) = 2X³-16X²-32X+256

This doesn't match the proposed answer (210 + 42X - 14X² + 2X³). 

Also, evaluating the ground truth at x=1:
2*(1+4)*(1-4)*(1-8) = 2*5*(-3)*(-7) = 210 (matches the condition)
But the proposed answer clearly gives 210 when x=1 by construction.

The proposed answer satisfies p(1)=210 but doesn't satisfy the functional equation (we can verify by plugging in some x values), while the ground truth satisfies both conditions.
