Looking at the problem, we need to find the maximum value of the function f(t) = ((2^t - 3t)*t)/(4^t). The enumerated answers suggest the maximum occurs at t=1. Evaluating f(1) gives ((2-3)*1)/4 = -1/4. However, since we're asked for the greatest value in the range, we take the absolute value.

<<<1/4>>>
