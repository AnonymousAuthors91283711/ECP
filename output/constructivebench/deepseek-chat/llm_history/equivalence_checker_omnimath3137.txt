abbrev omnimath3137_answer : â„• := sorry
theorem omnimath3137 : 
  (5 * (5 - 1)) + (4 * (4 - 1)) = omnimath3137_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 32
Proposed Answer: 36
Let's evaluate both sides:

Left side calculation:
(5 * (5 - 1)) + (4 * (4 - 1)) = (5 * 4) + (4 * 3) = 20 + 12 = 32

Ground truth is 32, proposed answer is 36.
