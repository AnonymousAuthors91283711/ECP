Ground Truth Answer: 1/3
Proposed Answer: 32 / (4 - sqrt 15)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the greatest value of an infinite series ∑(cos θ')ⁿ where θ' satisfies sin θ' = √(T²-64)/T with T=32.

2. First, calculate √(T²-64)/T when T=32:
   √(32²-64)/32 = √(1024-64)/32 = √960/32 = √(64*15)/32 = 8√15/32 = √15/4

3. So sin θ' = √15/4. Then cos θ' = √(1 - sin²θ') = √(1 - 15/16) = √(1/16) = 1/4

4. The series ∑(cos θ')ⁿ is a geometric series with ratio r=cos θ'=1/4.
   Its sum is 1/(1-r) = 1/(1-1/4) = 4/3

5. The ground truth answer is 1/3, but based on our calculation it should be 4/3.

6. The proposed answer is 32/(4-√15). Let's evaluate this:
   32/(4-√15) ≈ 32/(4-3.87298) ≈ 32/0.12702 ≈ 251.93
   This is clearly not equal to 4/3.

The ground truth answer seems incorrect (should be 4/3), while the proposed answer is completely different and incorrect.
