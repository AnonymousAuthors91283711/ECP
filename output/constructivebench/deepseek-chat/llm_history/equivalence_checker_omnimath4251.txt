Ground Truth Answer: (range (fun (n : ℤ) => (n : ℝ))) ∪ (⋃ (n : ℕ), Ioo (n : ℝ) (sqrt ((n - 1)^2 + 1) + 1))
Proposed Answer: {x | ∃ n : ℤ, x ∈ Ico (n : ℝ) (n + 1) ∧ (n ≤ x ∧ x < n + sqrt (n^2 + 2*n + 2))}
Let me analyze the problem and compare the answers:

1. The problem involves finding all real numbers x that satisfy a floor function equation involving x² and x.

2. The ground truth answer consists of:
   - All integers (via the range of ℤ → ℝ)
   - Plus intervals (n, √((n-1)²+1)+1) for natural numbers n

3. The proposed answer describes:
   - Numbers in [n, n+1) where n ≤ x < n + √(n²+2n+2)

Key observations:
- The ground truth includes all integers explicitly, while the proposed answer includes them via n ≤ x < n+1 when x=n.
- The intervals are different: ground truth uses √((n-1)²+1)+1 while proposed uses n + √(n²+2n+2)
- The proposed answer's interval endpoint simplifies to √((n+1)²+1), which is different from ground truth's √((n-1)²+1)+1
- The proposed answer's condition n ≤ x is redundant since x ∈ Ico n (n+1) already implies n ≤ x < n+1

The answers are not equivalent because:
1. The interval endpoints don't match
2. The ground truth's intervals are open (Ioo) while proposed uses half-open (Ico)
3. The proposed answer's condition is more restrictive than needed
