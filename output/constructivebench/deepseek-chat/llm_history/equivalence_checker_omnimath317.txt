Ground Truth Answer: { fun _ => 0, fun x => x^2 - 1/x }
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℝ, f = fun x => if x = 0 then 0 else c * x^2}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for all real-valued functions f that satisfy a certain functional equation involving x, y, z ≠ 0 with xyz = 1.

2. The ground truth provides two specific solutions: the zero function and f(x) = x² - 1/x.

3. The proposed answer suggests all functions of the form f(x) = c·x² (with f(0)=0), where c is a constant.

Key observations:
- The zero function (c=0 case) is indeed correct and matches the ground truth's first function.
- The second ground truth function (x² - 1/x) is not of the form c·x².
- The proposed answer misses the x² - 1/x solution entirely.
- The proposed answer doesn't account for the -1/x term which is crucial for satisfying the given functional equation.

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It's missing an entire family of valid solutions (x² - 1/x)
2. It incorrectly suggests that all scaled quadratic functions work, when only c=0 and c=1 work (but even c=1 alone is insufficient)
