abbrev omnimath3451_answer : ‚Ñù := sorry
theorem omnimath3451 :
  let m_last := 100 / 1.25
  let s_last := 100 / 0.8
  m_last + s_last = omnimath3451_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 205
Proposed Answer: 225
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines:
   - m_last := 100 / 1.25
   - s_last := 100 / 0.8
   And asks for m_last + s_last

2. Calculations:
   - 100 / 1.25 = 80
   - 100 / 0.8 = 125
   - Sum: 80 + 125 = 205

3. Ground truth answer is 205 (correct)
4. Proposed answer is 225 (incorrect)

The proposed answer is wrong because:
- It either miscalculated the divisions
- Or added incorrectly

<<<False>>>
