From the problem statement and enumerated answers, we can deduce that the function f is logarithmic in nature (due to the multiplicative property) and evaluates to p on primes p. The answer should be a rational number where f evaluates to a negative value. The simplest such number would be the reciprocal of a prime, since f(1/p) = -f(p) = -p by the multiplicative property.
