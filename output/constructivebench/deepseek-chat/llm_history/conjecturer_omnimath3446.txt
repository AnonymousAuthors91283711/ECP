theorem omnimath3446 : omnimath3446_answer > 0.7 := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: 1 / (2 * Real.sqrt 2). Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 7, which is at "omnimath3446_answer " in "abbrev omnimath3446_answer : ℝ :=  π / 4", there is an error: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instDivInvMonoid', and it does not have executable code.

Based on the error message and the problem context, I notice that:
1. The problem involves Real numbers and requires a noncomputable definition
2. The proposed answer involves π and square roots
3. The theorem states the answer should be greater than 0.7

Looking at the enumerated answers and the mathematical context, I believe the correct answer is π/4, which is approximately 0.785 > 0.7. The error occurs because Real numbers involving π are noncomputable in Lean, so we need to mark the definition as noncomputable.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev omnimath3446_answer : ℝ := π / 4>>>

Explanation:
- π/4 is a well-known mathematical constant (~0.785) that satisfies the >0.7 condition
- The noncomputable annotation is needed because π is a noncomputable real number in Lean
- This matches the expected type ℝ and the theorem statement
- The original proposed answer (1/(2√2) ≈ 0.353) doesn't satisfy the >0.7 condition, so π/4 is more likely correct[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the error message and the problem context, we need to make the definition noncomputable since it involves real numbers (π) which don't have executable code in Lean. The proposed answer π/4 is a reasonable conjecture since it's a common constant that's approximately 0.785, which satisfies the theorem (> 0.7). Here's the fixed version:

<<<noncomputable abbrev omnimath3446_answer : ℝ := π / 4>>>

Explanation:
1. The error indicates we need to mark the definition as noncomputable because it uses π (a real number operation)
2. π/4 ≈ 0.7854 which satisfies the theorem (> 0.7)
3. This is a clean mathematical constant that often appears in such problems
4. The noncomputable annotation tells Lean this is a mathematical definition rather than something we expect to compute numerically[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
