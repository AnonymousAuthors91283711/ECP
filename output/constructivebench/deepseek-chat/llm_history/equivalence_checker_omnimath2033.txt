Ground Truth Answer: 222480
Proposed Answer: 6 * 5 * 5 * 4 * 4 * 3 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 1 * 1
Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is counting the number of injective functions from Fin 5 to Fin 6 × Fin 6 with certain constraints:
   - The first component must be injective
   - The second component must be injective
   - For each i, the first and second components must be different

2. The ground truth answer is 222480

3. The proposed answer is a product: 6 * 5 * 5 * 4 * 4 * 3 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 1 * 1

Let's evaluate the proposed answer:
- The product evaluates to 6*5*5*4*4*3*3*2*2*1*1 = 43200
- This is much smaller than the ground truth answer of 222480
- The proposed answer seems to be missing some combinatorial factors

The correct calculation should consider:
1. Choose 5 distinct first components (P(6,5) = 6*5*4*3*2)
2. Choose 5 distinct second components (P(6,5) = 6*5*4*3*2)
3. Subtract cases where any f(i).1 = f(i).2

The proposed answer doesn't match this reasoning and gives a much smaller number.
