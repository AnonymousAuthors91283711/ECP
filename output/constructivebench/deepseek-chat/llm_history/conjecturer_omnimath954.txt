From the problem statement and the pattern of the equations, we can see this is a system of equations involving complex numbers with symmetry between a and b. The solution set appears to be points where either:
1. (a,b) = (5,4) (trivial solution when denominator is large)
2. Or points on a circle where a^2 + b^2 = 10 (nontrivial solutions)

<<<{(5, 4)} ∪ { (a, b) : ℂ × ℂ | a^2 + b^2 = 10 ∧ a + b = 9 }>>>
