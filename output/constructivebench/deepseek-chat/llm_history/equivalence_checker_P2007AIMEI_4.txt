Ground Truth Answer: 105
Proposed Answer: 420
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest positive integer n that is a common multiple of 60, 84, and 140. This is equivalent to finding the least common multiple (LCM) of these three numbers.

2. First, let's factorize each number:
   - 60 = 2² × 3 × 5
   - 84 = 2² × 3 × 7
   - 140 = 2² × 5 × 7

3. The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime present:
   - LCM = 2² × 3 × 5 × 7 = 4 × 3 × 5 × 7 = 420

4. The ground truth answer is 105, but 105 is actually the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these numbers, not the LCM.

5. The proposed answer 420 is indeed the correct LCM of 60, 84, and 140.

The ground truth answer appears to be incorrect, while the proposed answer is correct.
