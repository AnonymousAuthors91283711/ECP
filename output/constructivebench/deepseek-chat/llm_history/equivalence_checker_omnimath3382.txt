Ground Truth Answer: fun k => 1/6 + 1/(3 * (-2)^k)
Proposed Answer: fun k : ℕ => 1/6 + 1/(3 * (-2)^k)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer and ground truth answer are equivalent. Both define a function that takes a natural number k and returns the value 1/6 + 1/(3 * (-2)^k). The only difference is that the proposed answer explicitly specifies the type ℕ for the parameter k, while the ground truth answer infers it from context. This type annotation doesn't affect the actual behavior of the function.
