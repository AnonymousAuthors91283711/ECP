Ground Truth Answer: {(9, 3), (6, 3), (9, 5), (54, 5)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 0), (3, 1), (5, 2), (11, 4)} ∪ {(2*3^k, k+1) | k : ℕ} ∪ {(3^k, k) | k : ℕ}
Let me analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

1. First, let's check if the ground truth solutions are in the proposed answer:
   - (9,3): 9=3^2 and 3=2+1 → matches (3^k, k) pattern with k=3
   - (6,3): 6=2*3^1 and 3=1+1 → matches (2*3^k, k+1) pattern with k=1
   - (9,5): 9=3^2 but 5≠2 → doesn't match any pattern
   - (54,5): 54=2*3^3 and 5=3+1 → matches (2*3^k, k+1) pattern with k=3

2. Now let's check some proposed solutions against the ground truth:
   - (1,0): 1^2 + 2*3^0 = 3 ≠ 1*(2^1-1) = 1 → incorrect
   - (3,1): 3^2 + 2*3^1 = 15 ≠ 3*(2^2-1) = 9 → incorrect
   - (5,2): 5^2 + 2*3^2 = 43 ≠ 5*(2^3-1) = 35 → incorrect
   - (11,4): 11^2 + 2*3^4 = 121+162=283 ≠ 11*(2^5-1)=341 → incorrect

The proposed answer includes incorrect solutions and misses some correct ones (like (9,5)). While it captures some patterns, it's not fully correct.
