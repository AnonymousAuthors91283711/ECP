Ground Truth Answer: 10 + 25/60
Proposed Answer: (22 - 12) * (60 / 57.6) + 12
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

The problem defines a watchTime function that transforms actualTime to a watched time. The conditions require:
1. watchTime(solution) = 22
2. solution is the minimal actual time that satisfies this

The ground truth answer is 10 + 25/60 (which is 10 hours and 25 minutes).

The proposed answer is (22-12)*(60/57.6)+12. Let's compute this:
= 10*(60/57.6)+12
= 10*(1.04166...)+12
≈ 10.4166 + 12 = 22.4166

This clearly doesn't match the ground truth answer of ~10.4166. The proposed answer seems to be incorrectly solving for actualTime given watchTime=22, but got the formula backwards (it should subtract 12 first, then divide by the ratio, then add 12).
