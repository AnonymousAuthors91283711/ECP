theorem omnimath3426

  (a ^ 2 < a ∧ a < 1 / a) ↔ omnimath3426_answer a := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a => a ^ 2 < a ∧ a < 1 / a
Proposed Answer: fun a : ℝ => a ∈ Set.Ioo (1 / 2) 1
Let's analyze the problem and answers carefully:

1. The problem is asking for a characterization of real numbers 'a' (specifically a=1/n where n>1 is natural) that satisfy both conditions:
   - a² < a
   - a < 1/a

2. The ground truth answer directly states these conditions as the answer.

3. The proposed answer suggests that 'a' must be in the open interval (1/2, 1).

Analysis of equivalence:
- For a=1/n where n>1:
  - a² < a simplifies to 1/n² < 1/n → n > 1 (always true by hypothesis)
  - a < 1/a simplifies to 1/n < n → n² > 1 → n > 1 (always true by hypothesis)
  - The interval (1/2,1) would correspond to n ∈ (1,2), but n must be integer >1 → only n=2 is valid (a=0.5)

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It's too restrictive - only allows a=0.5 when the original conditions hold for all n>1 (a=1/2, 1/3, 1/4,...)
2. The ground truth correctly captures all cases where both inequalities hold, while the proposed answer misses most cases
