Looking at the problem, we need to simplify the product of two sine functions using trigonometric identities. The product-to-sum identity for sine is:
sin A * sin B = 1/2 [cos(A-B) - cos(A+B)]

Applying this to sin(1998 + 237) * sin(1998 - 1653):
1. Let A = 1998 + 237
2. Let B = 1998 - 1653
3. Then A-B = (1998+237)-(1998-1653) = 237 + 1653
4. And A+B = (1998+237)+(1998-1653) = 2*1998 + (237-1653)

The error in the original expression was due to missing parentheses around the denominator (1/2). Here's the corrected version:

<<<(1/2) * (cos (237 + 1653) - cos (2 * 1998 + 237 - 1653))>>>

This matches the product-to-sum identity application and should compile correctly in Lean. The expression calculates the exact value of the original trigonometric product by converting it into a difference of cosines.
