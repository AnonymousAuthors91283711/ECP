Ground Truth Answer: fun L P => L + (1/3) * (P - L)
Proposed Answer: fun L P => (2 * L + P) / 3
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground truth: L + (1/3)*(P - L)
= L + (1/3)P - (1/3)L
= (1 - 1/3)L + (1/3)P
= (2/3)L + (1/3)P
= (2L + P)/3

Proposed answer: (2*L + P)/3

We can see that after simplifying the ground truth answer, it becomes exactly the same as the proposed answer. Both expressions represent the same mathematical relationship, just written in different forms.
