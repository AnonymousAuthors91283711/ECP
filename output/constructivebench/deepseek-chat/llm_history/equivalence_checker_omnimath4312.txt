abbrev omnimath4312_answer : Set (ℤ × ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath4312 (x y : ℤ) :
    x^3 - y^3 = 2 * x * y + 8 ↔ (x, y) ∈ omnimath4312_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 0), (0, -2)}
Proposed Answer: {(2, 0), (0, -2), (-1, -1)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation is x³ - y³ = 2xy + 8
2. We can rewrite this as (x-y)(x² + xy + y²) = 2xy + 8
3. Let's test the proposed solutions:

For (2,0):
2³ - 0³ = 8
2*2*0 + 8 = 8
Valid solution

For (0,-2):
0³ - (-2)³ = 8
2*0*(-2) + 8 = 8
Valid solution

For (-1,-1):
(-1)³ - (-1)³ = 0
2*(-1)*(-1) + 8 = 2 + 8 = 10
0 ≠ 10, so this is not a valid solution

The proposed answer includes (-1,-1) which doesn't satisfy the equation, while the ground truth correctly identifies only the valid solutions.

<<<False>>>
