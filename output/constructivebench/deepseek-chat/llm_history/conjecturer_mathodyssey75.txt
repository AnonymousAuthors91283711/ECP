Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 39, which is at "Icc (-(√2 / 2)) (√2 " in "abbrev mathodyssey75_answer : Set ℝ := Icc (-(√2 / 2)) (√2 / 2)", there is an error: unknown identifier 'Icc'.
. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The error occurs because `Icc` (interval closed-closed) needs to be qualified with its namespace `Set` since we're working with real numbers. The problem asks for the range of possible values of (x-y)(y-z)(x-z) under the constraint x² + y² + z² = 1. From the theorem statement, we can see the maximum is √2/2 and minimum is -√2/2, and the set should include all values between them.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<Set.Icc (-(√2 / 2)) (√2 / 2)>>>

Explanation:
1. The error was simply a missing namespace qualification for `Icc`
2. The solution set is the closed interval from -√2/2 to √2/2 because:
   - The theorem states these are the greatest and least values
   - The set appears to be continuous (all intermediate values are achievable)
   - The enumerated answers would show values filling this interval
3. This matches the problem's requirement that the answer be a Set ℝ
