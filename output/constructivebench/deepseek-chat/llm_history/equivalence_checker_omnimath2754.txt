Ground Truth Answer: 27
Proposed Answer: 34
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n such that there exist natural numbers a, b, c with:
   - a < b < c < n
   - a + b + c + n = 100

2. The ground truth answer is 27. Let's verify this:
   - For n=27, we need a+b+c=73 with a<b<c<27
   - A possible solution is a=23, b=24, c=26 (23+24+26=73)
   - No smaller n would work because we need c < n and a < b < c, and the sum would be too large for n < 27

3. The proposed answer is 34:
   - For n=34, we'd need a+b+c=66 with a<b<c<34
   - While possible (e.g., a=21, b=22, c=23), this is not the minimal n
   - 34 is larger than the minimal solution (27)

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't give the smallest possible n that satisfies the conditions.
