theorem omnimath1861 :
  let students := 36
  let multiples : Finset ℕ := {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
  let totalPairs := students * students
  let sameMultiplePairs := ∑ k in multiples, (k : ℚ) * k

Ground Truth Answer: 3/17
Proposed Answer: 1 / 204
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating a probability ratio where:
   - There are 36 students
   - We're considering multiples from 1 to 8
   - totalPairs = 36*36 = 1296 possible pairs
   - sameMultiplePairs = sum of k² for k=1 to 8 = 1+4+9+16+25+36+49+64 = 204
   - samePersonPairs = sum of k for k=1 to 8 = 36

2. The ratio being calculated is samePersonPairs / sameMultiplePairs = 36/204 = 3/17 when simplified

3. The ground truth answer is correct: 3/17

4. The proposed answer is 1/204, which is incorrect because:
   - It's the reciprocal of sameMultiplePairs (204/1)
   - It's missing the numerator (samePersonPairs = 36)
   - The correct ratio is 36/204 = 3/17

<<<False>>>
