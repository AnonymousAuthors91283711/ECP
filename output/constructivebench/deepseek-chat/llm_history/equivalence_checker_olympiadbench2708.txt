Ground Truth Answer: 12
Proposed Answer: 1584 * 22
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal positive integers x and y satisfying certain divisibility and cube conditions involving 1584.

2. The ground truth answer is y = 12.

3. The proposed answer is "1584 * 22", which evaluates to 34848.

Analysis:
- The ground truth answer (12) is much smaller than the proposed answer (34848).
- The conditions require y to be the minimal positive integer satisfying certain properties, and 12 is indeed a much more plausible minimal solution than 34848.
- The proposed answer appears to be incorrectly interpreting the problem, possibly by misunderstanding the divisibility conditions.

Conclusion: The answers are not equivalent.
