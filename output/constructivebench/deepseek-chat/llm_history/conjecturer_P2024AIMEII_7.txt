From the problem statement and enumerated answers, we need to find the largest 4-digit number N (1000 ≤ N ≤ 9999) where modifying any single digit to 1 makes it divisible by 7. The final condition requires adding the first and last 3 digits of N. The pattern suggests the answer is 7 less than the maximum 4-digit number divisible by 7 (9996), giving 9996/1000 + 9996%1000 = 9 + 996 = 1005.
