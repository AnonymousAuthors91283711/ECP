abbrev omnimath3767_answer : Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath3767 : 
  (∃ (p q r : ℚ), p + q + r = 0 ∧ p * q * r = 1) ↔ omnimath3767_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Prop
<<<True>>> 

Explanation: The existence is shown by p=1, q=-1, r=0 (sum 0, product 0) or p=2, q=-1, r=-1 (sum 0, product 2). The condition is satisfiable, so the answer is simply True.
