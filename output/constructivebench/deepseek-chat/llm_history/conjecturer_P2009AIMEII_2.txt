Looking at the problem and the proposed answer, I notice several issues:

1. The exponents in the proposed answer don't match the given conditions (h1, h2, h3)
2. The error suggests we need to mark it as noncomputable
3. The third term should involve log 25 rather than log 5

The key is to solve each equation for a, b, c respectively:
- For a: From h1, we get a = 3^(3 * log 3 / log 7)
- For b: From h2, we get b = 7^(2 * log 7 / log 11)
- For c: From h3, we get c = 11^(log 25 / (2 * log 11))

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2009AIMEII_2_answer : ℝ := 3 ^ (3 * log 3 / log 7) + 7 ^ (2 * log 7 / log 11) + 11 ^ (log 25 / (2 * log 11))>>>

Explanation:
1. For a: Taking both sides of h1 to power (log 3 / log 7) gives a = 3^(3 * log 3 / log 7)
2. For b: Taking both sides of h2 to power (log 7 / log 11) gives b = 7^(2 * log 7 / log 11)
3. For c: Taking both sides of h3 to power (log 11 / log 25) gives c = 11^(1/(2 * log 11 / log 25)) = 11^(log 25 / (2 * log 11))
4. Added 'noncomputable' to resolve the compilation error[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem and the proposed answer, we need to find a closed form expression for a + b + c given the logarithmic conditions. The error suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real number operations.

The proposed answer correctly captures the pattern from the given conditions:
1. For 'a': 27 = 3³, so a = 3^(3/log₇3) = 3^(3*log3/log7)
2. For 'b': 49 = 7², so b = 7^(2/log₁₁7) = 7^(2*log7/log11)
3. For 'c': √11 = 11^(1/2), so c = 11^(log25/log11 / 2)

The only issue is the computability flag. Here's the corrected version:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2009AIMEII_2_answer : ℝ := 3 ^ (3 * log 3 / log 7) + 7 ^ (2 * log 7 / log 11) + 11 ^ (log 25 / (2 * log 11))>>>

The answer follows from solving each equation for its variable using logarithm properties:
1. Take log of both sides of each equation
2. Solve for the variable
3. The exponents become (log of right side)/(log of base)
4. Simplify using log identities[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
