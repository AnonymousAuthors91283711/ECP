The error occurs because the symbol π (pi) needs to be properly imported from Mathlib. In Lean, π is defined in the Mathlib.Real library. The proposed answer is correct in its mathematical form (256*(π-2)), but we need to properly reference pi.

Here's the corrected version:

<<<256 * (Real.pi - 2)>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem involves calculating the area between a circle (x² + y² ≥ 256) and a diamond (|x| + |y| ≤ √512).
2. The area of the circle is π*16² = 256π
3. The area of the diamond is (√512)² = 512
4. The intersection area is the circle minus the diamond's inscribed circle, which gives 256π - 512 = 256(π - 2)
5. We use Real.pi instead of π to properly reference the constant in Lean.
