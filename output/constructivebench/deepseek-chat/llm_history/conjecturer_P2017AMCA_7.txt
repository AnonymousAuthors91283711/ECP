theorem P2017AMCA_7
(f : ℕ → ℕ)
(hf1 : f 1 = 2)
(hfeven : ∀ n : ℕ, n > 1 ∧ Even n → f n = f (n - 1) + 1)
(hfodd : ∀ n : ℕ, n > 1 ∧ Odd n → f n = f (n - 2) + 2)
: f 2017 = P2017AMCA_7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern from enumerated answers:
- f(1) = 2
- f(2) = 3 (even: f(1)+1)
- f(3) = 4 (odd: f(1)+2)
- f(4) = 5 (even: f(3)+1)
- f(5) = 6 (odd: f(3)+2)
The function appears to be f(n) = n + 1 for all n ≥ 1.
