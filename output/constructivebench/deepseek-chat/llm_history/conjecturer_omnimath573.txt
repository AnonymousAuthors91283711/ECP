Based on the problem statement and error message, I can see this is about calculating an optimal probability in a game theory scenario with 3 boxes and 2 possible decisions. The error appears to be a syntax issue in the theorem statement rather than the answer itself.

The problem involves:
1. Three boxes with different configurations (⟨0,0⟩, ⟨1,1⟩, ⟨0,1⟩)
2. A strategy that wins when decisions match (d1 = d2)
3. Calculating the maximum win probability (5/6 seems correct based on the given terms)

The proposed answer 5/6 makes sense because:
- For boxes ⟨0,0⟩ and ⟨1,1⟩, the optimal strategy wins with probability 1
- For box ⟨0,1⟩, it wins with probability 1/2
- The total is (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(1/2) = 5/6

Here's the corrected answer:
