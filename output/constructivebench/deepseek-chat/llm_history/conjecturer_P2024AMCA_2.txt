Looking at the problem, we need to find a general solution for T(L3,G3) given that T(L1,G1) = T(L2,G2) = 69. The proposed answer seems to be trying to scale the original value 69 based on ratios of L and G values, but it's not correctly accounting for the linear relationship T = a*L + b*G.

From the given data points:
1. 69 = a*1.5 + b*800
2. 69 = a*1.2 + b*1100

We can solve for a and b:
Subtracting equations: 0 = 0.3a - 300b → a = 1000b
Substituting into first equation: 69 = 1500b + 800b → b = 69/2300 = 3/100
Thus a = 1000*(3/100) = 30

Now for (L3,G3) = (4.2,4000):
T = 30*4.2 + (3/100)*4000 = 126 + 120 = 246

The correct answer should be 246, not the proposed expression. The error in the original proposal was both mathematical (incorrect scaling) and technical (needed noncomputable annotation).

<<<246>>>
