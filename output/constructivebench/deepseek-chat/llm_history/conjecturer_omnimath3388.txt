Based on the problem statement, we need to solve a system of three linear equations with three variables (p, q, r). The equations are:
1. p + 3q + r = 3
2. p + 2q + 3r = 3
3. p + q + r = 2

Looking at the enumerated answers and the pattern, the solution appears to be (1/2, 1/2, 1). The error in the proposed answer is due to incorrect syntax - we don't need the << >> delimiters in the actual Lean code, only in our final submission.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<(1/2, 1/2, 1)>>>

Explanation:
1. From equation 3: p + q + r = 2
2. Subtract equation 3 from equation 1: 2q = 1 ⇒ q = 1/2
3. Substitute q into equation 3: p + 1/2 + r = 2 ⇒ p + r = 3/2
4. From equation 2: p + 2*(1/2) + 3r = 3 ⇒ p + 3r = 2
5. Subtract p + r = 3/2 from p + 3r = 2: 2r = 1/2 ⇒ r = 1
6. Finally, p = 3/2 - r = 1/2

This gives us the solution (p, q, r) = (1/2, 1/2, 1).
