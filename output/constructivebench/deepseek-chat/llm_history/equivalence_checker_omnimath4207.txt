Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a set of natural numbers that:
   - Has exactly n elements (n=100)
   - All elements are between 1 and 25000
   - Has the unique sums property (x+y=x'+y' implies x=x' and y=y')

2. Ground Truth Answer: Powers of 2 up to 2^(n-1)
   - This satisfies all conditions:
     - Exactly n elements (2^0 to 2^(n-1))
     - All elements ≤ 2^99 which is < 25000 when n=100
     - Powers of 2 have unique sums (binary representation property)

3. Proposed Answer: Numbers from n+1 to 2n
   - For n=100: numbers from 101 to 200
   - Has exactly n elements (101-200)
   - All elements ≤ 200 < 25000
   - However, it fails the unique sums property:
     Example: 101+200 = 102+199 = 301, but 101≠102 and 200≠199

<<<False>>>
