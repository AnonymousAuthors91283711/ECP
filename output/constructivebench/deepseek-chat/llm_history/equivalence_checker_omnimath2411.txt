Ground Truth Answer: 20 / 3
Proposed Answer: 2 / 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two equations:
   - 20 = 4a² + 9b²
   - 20 + 12ab = (2a + 3b)²

2. Let's expand the second equation:
   (2a + 3b)² = 4a² + 12ab + 9b²
   So 20 + 12ab = 4a² + 12ab + 9b²
   Subtract 12ab from both sides: 20 = 4a² + 9b²

3. This matches exactly with the first equation, meaning the second equation doesn't give us any new information beyond the first equation.

4. The first equation alone (20 = 4a² + 9b²) describes an ellipse in the (a,b) plane, and there are infinitely many (a,b) pairs that satisfy it. The product ab can take many different values.

5. The ground truth answer 20/3 is incorrect because it's not uniquely determined by the given equations (for example, a=√5, b=0 satisfies the equation with ab=0, while a=0, b=√(20/9) also satisfies it with ab=0).

6. The proposed answer 2/3 is also incorrect for the same reason - the problem doesn't provide enough constraints to uniquely determine ab.

Conclusion: Both answers are incorrect, but they're incorrect in the same fundamental way (claiming a unique solution when none exists). However, they propose different numerical values, so they're not equivalent.
