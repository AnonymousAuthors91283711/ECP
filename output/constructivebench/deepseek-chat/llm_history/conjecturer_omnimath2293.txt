Looking at the pattern of numbers with cube divisors between 1 and 1,000,000, we observe they follow the form of multiples of perfect cubes (k³) where k > 1. The count is floor(1,000,000/k³) for each k > 1, summed up to where k³ ≤ 1,000,000. The largest such k is 100 since 100³ = 1,000,000.

<<<∑ k in Finset.Icc 2 100, 1000000 / (k ^ 3)>>>
