abbrev P2024AMCB_2_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2024AMCB_2 : 10! - 7! * 6! = P2024AMCB_2_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 0
Proposed Answer: 460800
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to evaluate 10! - 7! × 6! and provide the result.

2. Calculating the values:
   - 10! = 3,628,800
   - 7! = 5,040
   - 6! = 720
   - 7! × 6! = 5,040 × 720 = 3,628,800

3. Therefore, 10! - 7! × 6! = 3,628,800 - 3,628,800 = 0

4. The ground truth answer is 0, which is correct.

5. The proposed answer is 460,800, which is incorrect.

The two answers are not equivalent.
