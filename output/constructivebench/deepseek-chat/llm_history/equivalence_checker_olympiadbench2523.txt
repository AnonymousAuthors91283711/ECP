Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0), (0, 5 / 2), (1 / 2, 0), (-1 / 2, 0), (3 / 2, 4), (-1, 3 / 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(0, 0), (0, 5/2), (1/2, 2), (-1/2, 2)} ∪ { (x, 2 * x^2 - 1/2) | x : ℝ }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all real pairs (x,y) that satisfy both equations:
   - x*(1/2 + y - 2x²) = 0
   - y*(5/2 + x - y) = 0

2. The ground truth answer provides 6 specific solutions that satisfy both equations.

3. The proposed answer has several issues:
   - (1/2, 2) doesn't satisfy the second equation (2*(5/2 + 1/2 - 2) = 2*1 = 2 ≠ 0)
   - (-1/2, 2) doesn't satisfy the second equation (2*(5/2 - 1/2 - 2) = 2*0 = 0, but checking first equation: -1/2*(1/2 + 2 - 2*(1/4)) = -1/2*(2.5 - 0.5) = -1 ≠ 0)
   - The set { (x, 2 * x^2 - 1/2) } only satisfies the first equation when x=0, but needs to also satisfy the second equation

The proposed answer is incorrect as it includes invalid solutions and an infinite set that doesn't properly satisfy both equations.
