From the problem statement and enumerated answers (6, 27, 39, 77), we observe these are all semiprimes (products of two primes). The first condition requires a number that's not a semiprime. The smallest such number greater than all enumerated answers is 81 (3^4), but 81 is 3*27. The next candidate is 85 (5*17), which is a semiprime. The correct answer is the smallest non-semiprime greater than 77, which is 81 (but fails), then 82 (2*41), 83 (prime), 84 (2*2*3*7), etc. The first valid answer is 83 since it's prime (not expressible as product of two >1 numbers).
