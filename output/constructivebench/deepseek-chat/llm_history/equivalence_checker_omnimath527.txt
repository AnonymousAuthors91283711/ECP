Ground Truth Answer: 1 + 1 / (2014 * 2015)
Proposed Answer: 1 / 2015 - 1 / 2015^2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines two recursive sequences a(n) and b(n) with initial conditions and recurrence relations. It asks to find the sum of an infinite series involving these sequences.

2. The ground truth answer is 1 + 1/(2014*2015), which simplifies to (2014*2015 + 1)/(2014*2015).

3. The proposed answer is 1/2015 - 1/2015², which simplifies to (2015 - 1)/2015² = 2014/2015².

4. Comparing the simplified forms:
   - Ground truth: (2014*2015 + 1)/2014*2015 ≈ 1 + 1/2014*2015 ≈ 1 + very small term
   - Proposed: 2014/2015² ≈ 2014/2015 * 1/2015 ≈ much smaller than ground truth

5. The proposed answer is significantly different from the ground truth both in form and magnitude. The ground truth is approximately 1.000000247, while the proposed is approximately 0.000494.
