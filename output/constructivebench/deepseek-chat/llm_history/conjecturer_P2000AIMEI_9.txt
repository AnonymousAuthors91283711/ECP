Looking at the problem, we're dealing with symmetric sums of three variables with given constraints. The error suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real number operations (specifically square roots) that aren't computable in Lean's default mode.

The proposed answer 4 / (3 * √3) seems plausible because:
1. The problem involves symmetric polynomials and roots
2. The constraints suggest we're dealing with roots of a cubic equation
3. The enumerated answers hint at a solution involving √3

The error can be fixed by adding the `noncomputable` modifier. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2000AIMEI_9_answer : ℝ := 4 / (3 * Real.sqrt 3)>>>

This matches the pattern seen in symmetric polynomial problems where the solution often involves roots of unity or their combinations. The denominator 3√3 suggests a relationship with the 120° rotations in complex plane, which often appear in cubic root problems.

The answer represents the sum of the y-components of two distinct solution triples to the given symmetric polynomial constraints, where the solutions are likely complex conjugates or permutations involving √3 terms.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the problem statement and the error message, we need to make the answer noncomputable since it involves real number operations (specifically square roots) that aren't computable in Lean's default mode. The proposed answer 4/(3√3) seems reasonable given the symmetry of the problem and the constraints.

The error suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable. The answer should be the same mathematically, but properly annotated for Lean.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2000AIMEI_9_answer : ℝ := 4 / (3 * Real.sqrt 3)>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem involves symmetric polynomial equations in real numbers, suggesting a symmetric solution.
2. The constraints x+y+z=6, x²+y²+z²=8, x³+y³+z³=5 typically lead to solutions involving roots of unity or symmetric combinations.
3. The enumerated answers and the proposed solution suggest the final answer is 4/(3√3).
4. The noncomputable annotation is needed because Real.sqrt is a noncomputable operation in Lean.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
