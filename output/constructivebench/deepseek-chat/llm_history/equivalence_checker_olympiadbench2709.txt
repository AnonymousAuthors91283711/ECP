Ground Truth Answer: 1525
Proposed Answer: 625
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the least natural number m in the form m = 25*p where p satisfies several inequalities involving a and p.

2. The inequalities can be simplified:
   - 500 < 5(a + p) < 1000 → 100 < a + p < 200
   - 1000 < 2a + 12p < 2000 → 500 < a + 6p < 1000

3. We need to find the smallest m = 25*p that satisfies these conditions.

4. Ground truth answer is 1525 (which means p = 61 since 25*61=1525)
   - Checking p=61: a must satisfy both:
     - 100 < a + 61 < 200 → 39 < a < 139
     - 500 < a + 366 < 1000 → 134 < a < 634
     - Combined: 134 < a < 139
     - Any a in 135..138 works

5. Proposed answer is 625 (which means p=25 since 25*25=625)
   - Checking p=25: a must satisfy:
     - 100 < a + 25 < 200 → 75 < a < 175
     - 500 < a + 150 < 1000 → 350 < a < 850
     - Combined: 350 < a < 175 → Impossible (empty set)

The proposed answer 625 doesn't satisfy the conditions since no a exists for p=25 that satisfies all inequalities. The ground truth 1525 is correct.
