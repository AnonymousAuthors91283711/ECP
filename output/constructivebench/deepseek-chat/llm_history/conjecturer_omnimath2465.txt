<<<11>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks for the count of numbers ≥10^9 divisible by 11 with non-increasing digits. The enumerated answer shows only 11 such numbers exist (all digits equal), matching the pattern where n = d*1111111111 with d∈[1,9]. Divisibility by 11 is satisfied since 1111111111 = 11×41×271×9091.
