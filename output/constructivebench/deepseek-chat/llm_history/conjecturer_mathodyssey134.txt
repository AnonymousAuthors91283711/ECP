<<<512>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks for the maximum number of subsets of a 10-element set where any two subsets intersect (pairwise intersecting family) and any additional subset would violate this property. For an n-element set, this maximum is known to be 2^(n-1), which for n=10 gives 512. The enumerated answers confirm this pattern.
