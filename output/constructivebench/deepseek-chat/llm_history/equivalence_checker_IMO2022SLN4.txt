theorem IMO2022SLN4 (a b p : ℕ) (ha : 0 < a) (hb : 0 < b) (hp : Nat.Prime p) :
  a^p = b! + p ↔ (a, b, p) ∈ IMO2022SLN4_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 2, 2), (3, 4, 3)}
Proposed Answer: {(2, 2, 2), (2, 3, 2), (2, 4, 3), (3, 2, 3), (5, 4, 5)}
Let's analyze the proposed answer against the ground truth:

1. (2,2,2) is correct: 2² = 2! + 2 → 4 = 2 + 2
2. (3,4,3) is missing from proposed answer (should be included)
3. (2,3,2) is incorrect: 2² = 4 ≠ 3! + 2 = 8
4. (2,4,3) is incorrect: 2³ = 8 ≠ 4! + 3 = 27
5. (3,2,3) is incorrect: 3³ = 27 ≠ 2! + 3 = 5
6. (5,4,5) is incorrect: 5⁵ = 3125 ≠ 4! + 5 = 29

The proposed answer contains only one correct pair (2,2,2) but misses (3,4,3) and includes several incorrect pairs.
