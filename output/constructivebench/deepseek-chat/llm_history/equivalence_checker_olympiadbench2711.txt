Ground Truth Answer: 2019
Proposed Answer: 2014
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest number greater than 2013 that cannot be expressed as the sum of two palindromic numbers (with the given constraints on palindromes).

2. The ground truth answer is 2019, which means:
   - All numbers from 2014 to 2018 can be expressed as sums of two palindromic numbers
   - 2019 cannot be expressed as such a sum

3. The proposed answer is 2014, which would mean:
   - 2014 cannot be expressed as a sum of two palindromic numbers
   - But this is incorrect because 2014 can be written as 2002 + 12 (both palindromes)

The proposed answer fails to recognize that 2014 can indeed be expressed as a sum of two palindromic numbers, while the ground truth correctly identifies 2019 as the smallest number with this property.
