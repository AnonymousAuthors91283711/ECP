Proposed Answer: 6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the greatest natural number x that can be formed by the expression c * a^b - d where {a,b,c,d} is some permutation of {0,1,2,3}.

2. To find the maximum value, we need to consider all permutations of {0,1,2,3} for (a,b,c,d) and evaluate c*a^b - d.

3. Let's evaluate some key permutations:
   - (2,3,1,0): 1*2³ - 0 = 8 - 0 = 8
   - (1,2,3,0): 3*1² - 0 = 3 - 0 = 3
   - (2,1,3,0): 3*2¹ - 0 = 6 - 0 = 6
   - (3,2,1,0): 1*3² - 0 = 9 - 0 = 9
   - (1,0,3,2): 3*1⁰ - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1

4. The maximum value from these permutations is 9 (from (3,2,1,0)).

5. The proposed answer is 6, which is achievable (from (2,1,3,0)) but not the maximum.

6. The ground truth answer is 9, which is indeed the maximum possible value.
