Ground Truth Answer: 45/2
Proposed Answer: 22 - Real.sin (π / 180) * Real.sin (43 * π / 180) / Real.sin (π / 90)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem: We need to evaluate the sum of squared sines of angles in arithmetic progression: sum from k=0 to 43 of sin²(π(4 + 4k)/180).

Key observations:
1. The angles are from 4° to 172° in steps of 4° (44 terms total)
2. We can use the identity sin²x = (1 - cos(2x))/2
3. The sum of cosines of angles in arithmetic progression can be evaluated using trigonometric identities

Ground truth answer is 45/2 = 22.5

Proposed answer is 22 - [sin(π/180)sin(43π/180)]/sin(π/90)

Let's evaluate the proposed answer numerically:
- sin(π/180) ≈ 0.01745
- sin(43π/180) ≈ 0.6820
- sin(π/90) ≈ 0.03490
- The correction term ≈ (0.01745*0.6820)/0.03490 ≈ 0.341
- So proposed answer ≈ 22 - 0.341 ≈ 21.659

This differs significantly from 22.5. The proposed answer seems incorrect.
