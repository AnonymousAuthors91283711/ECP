Ground Truth Answer: fun x => x^7 + 64 * x^2
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℝ => (x^2 + 4)^2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem: We need to find a function f(x) such that for all real x satisfying x³ + 4x = 8, we have f(x) = 128.

Ground Truth Answer: f(x) = x⁷ + 64x²
Proposed Answer: f(x) = (x² + 4)²

Let's test both answers with a root of x³ + 4x - 8 = 0 (let's call it α):

1. Ground Truth:
α³ = 8 - 4α
α⁷ = α(α³)² = α(8-4α)² = α(64 - 64α + 16α²)
64α² remains
Total: 64α - 64α² + 16α³ + 64α² = 64α + 16α³ = 16α(4 + α²)
But α³ = 8 - 4α ⇒ α² = (8 - α³)/4
This seems to lead to 128 when worked out.

2. Proposed Answer:
(α² + 4)²
From α³ = 8 - 4α ⇒ α² = (8 - α³)/α
This doesn't immediately simplify to 128.

Numerical check with approximate root α ≈ 1.4422:
(1.4422² + 4)² ≈ (2.08 + 4)² ≈ 6.08² ≈ 37
Not equal to 128.

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the condition f(α) = 128.
