Based on the problem statement and the pattern of repDigit (which creates numbers with repeated digits), the solution likely involves combinations where x, y, z satisfy the equation for all n. The enumerated answers suggest specific digit combinations that work. Here's the generalized answer:

<<<{(4, 0, 2), (9, 0, 3), (1, 0, 1), (9, 5, 2), (6, 0, 2), (4, 1, 1), (9, 6, 1)}>>>
