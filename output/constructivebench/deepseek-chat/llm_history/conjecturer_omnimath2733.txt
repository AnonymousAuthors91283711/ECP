Explanation: The problem involves solving for θ in the equation cos60° = cos45° * cosθ. The enumerated answers suggest converting degrees to radians (π/3 for 60°, π/4 for 45°). The solution is θ = arccos(cos60°/(cos45° * cosθ)), but since θ appears on both sides, we need to isolate it. The final answer uses arccos to solve for θ.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

From the problem statement, we need to find θ such that cos(60°) = cos(45°) * cos(θ). The proposed answer was attempting to solve for θ using arccos, but had several issues:
1. Used π without proper import/notation
2. Referenced θ in the definition itself (circular)
3. Mixed degrees and radians incorrectly

The correct solution should be a constant value (not depending on θ) that satisfies the equation. Solving cos(60°) = cos(45°) * cos(θ) gives θ = arccos(cos(60°)/cos(45°)).

Here's the fixed version using proper Lean mathlib imports and conversions:

<<<Real.arccos (Real.cos (Real.pi / 3) / Real.cos (Real.pi / 4))>>>

Explanation:
1. Real.pi is used instead of π for proper Lean syntax
2. 60° is converted to radians as Real.pi/3
3. 45° is converted to radians as Real.pi/4
4. The answer is a closed-form expression that doesn't depend on θ
5. The expression correctly represents θ = arccos(cos(60°)/cos(45°)) in radians[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to find the angle θ (in degrees) that satisfies the equation cos(60°) = cos(45°) * cos(θ). The proposed answer uses radians (π/3 and π/4), but the problem is stated in degrees (0 ≤ θ ≤ 90).

The error occurs because we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real number operations. Also, we should work in degrees for consistency with the problem statement.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable def omnimath2733_answer : ℝ := Real.arccos (Real.cos (60 * Real.pi / 180) / Real.cos (45 * Real.pi / 180)) * (180 / Real.pi)>>>

Explanation:
1. We convert degrees to radians for the cosine calculations (60° → 60*π/180, 45° → 45*π/180)
2. Compute the ratio (cos(60°)/cos(45°))
3. Take the arccosine to find θ in radians
4. Convert back to degrees by multiplying by 180/π
5. Mark as noncomputable since it involves real number operations

The mathematical solution comes from solving cosθ = cos60°/cos45° = (1/2)/(√2/2) = 1/√2, so θ = 45°. However, the exact form above is more precise for Lean.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error occurs because we're mixing `abbrev` with `noncomputable def` syntax. Since we need to use `Real.arccos` which is noncomputable, we should declare the answer as a `noncomputable def` directly. The proposed solution correctly solves the equation cos(60°) = cos(45°)cos(θ) for θ by using arccos on the ratio of cosines and converting back from radians to degrees.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable def omnimath2733_answer : ℝ := Real.arccos (Real.cos (60 * Real.pi / 180) / Real.cos (45 * Real.pi / 180)) * (180 / Real.pi)>>>

Explanation:
1. The equation cos(60°) = cos(45°)cos(θ) is solved by dividing both sides by cos(45°)
2. We get cos(θ) = cos(60°)/cos(45°)
3. Applying arccos to both sides gives θ = arccos(cos(60°)/cos(45°))
4. Since trigonometric functions in Lean use radians, we need to convert the angles from degrees to radians (multiplying by π/180)
5. The final result needs to be converted back to degrees (multiplying by 180/π)[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
