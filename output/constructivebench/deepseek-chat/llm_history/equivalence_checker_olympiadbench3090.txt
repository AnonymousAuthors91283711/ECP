Ground Truth Answer: fun k => 2
Proposed Answer: fun k : ℕ => fib (k + 1) + fib k - 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about Fibonacci numbers and quadratic equations involving them. It states that if r and s are roots of a certain Fibonacci-based quadratic equation, then (r+1)(s+1) equals some function of k.

2. The ground truth answer is a constant function that always returns 2, regardless of k.

3. The proposed answer is a function that depends on Fibonacci numbers: fib(k+1) + fib(k) - 1.

Let's evaluate the proposed answer:
- For k=0: fib(1) + fib(0) - 1 = 1 + 0 - 1 = 0 ≠ 2
- For k=1: fib(2) + fib(1) - 1 = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1 ≠ 2
- For k=2: fib(3) + fib(2) - 1 = 2 + 1 - 1 = 2
- For k=3: fib(4) + fib(3) - 1 = 3 + 2 - 1 = 4 ≠ 2

The proposed answer only matches the ground truth at k=2, but diverges for other values. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
