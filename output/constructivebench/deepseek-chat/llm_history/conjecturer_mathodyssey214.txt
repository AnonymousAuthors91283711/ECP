Based on the error message, the issue is that the proposed answer involves noncomputable operations (Real.log and division on reals). In Lean, we need to mark such definitions as noncomputable. The mathematical expression itself appears correct for calculating the time t given the parameters P, r, and A in the continuous compound interest formula A = Pe^(rt).

Here's the fixed answer with the noncomputable annotation:

<<<noncomputable def mathodyssey214_answer : ℝ := (1 / 0.07) * Real.log (21337.85 / 8589)>>>

Explanation:
1. The expression correctly implements the solution to A = Pe^(rt) for t, which gives t = (1/r) * ln(A/P)
2. The values match those given in the theorem statement (P=8589, r=0.07, A=21337.85)
3. The noncomputable annotation is needed because Real.log and division on reals are noncomputable operations in Lean
4. The type annotation : ℝ ensures the result is treated as a real number[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error occurs because there are two conflicting declarations of `mathodyssey214_answer` - one as an `abbrev` and one as a `noncomputable def`. We should only have one declaration. Since we need to perform noncomputable operations (Real.log), we should use `noncomputable def` and remove the `abbrev`.

The solution is to compute the time `t` using the continuous compounding formula: t = (1/r) * ln(A/P), where:
- P = principal (8589)
- r = interest rate (0.07)
- A = amount (21337.85)

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable def mathodyssey214_answer : ℝ := (1 / 0.07) * Real.log (21337.85 / 8589)>>>

Explanation:
1. The formula comes from solving A = P*e^(r*t) for t
2. We use Real.log for natural logarithm (ln)
3. The division (1/0.07) computes the reciprocal of the interest rate
4. The division inside the log (21337.85/8589) computes the growth ratio
5. The result will be the time required for the investment to grow from P to A at rate r[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
