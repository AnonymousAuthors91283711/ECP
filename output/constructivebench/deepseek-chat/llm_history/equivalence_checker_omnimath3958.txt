Ground Truth Answer: { (a, b, c, d) | a = b ∧ b = c ∧ c = d }
Proposed Answer: { (a, b, c, d) | (a = b ∧ c = d) ∨ (a = c ∧ b = d) ∨ (a = d ∧ b = c) ∨ (a = b ∧ b = c ∧ c = d) }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us three equations that must hold simultaneously, relating four real numbers a, b, c, d.

2. The ground truth answer states that all four variables must be equal (a = b = c = d).

3. The proposed answer suggests several possibilities:
   - Two pairs of equal variables (a=b and c=d)
   - Two pairs of equal variables in different combinations (a=c and b=d, or a=d and b=c)
   - All four variables equal (a=b=c=d)

Testing the proposed answer:
- The case where all four are equal clearly satisfies all three original equations.
- For cases like a=b and c=d (but a≠c), let's test:
  First equation becomes: (a+a)(a²+a²) = (c+c)(c²+c²) → 4a³ = 4c³ → a = c
  So this reduces to all four being equal.
- Similar logic applies to the other cases in the proposed answer - they all reduce to all four variables being equal when you try to satisfy all three equations simultaneously.

Conclusion: While the proposed answer lists more cases, all non-trivial cases actually reduce to the ground truth answer. Therefore, the answers are equivalent.
