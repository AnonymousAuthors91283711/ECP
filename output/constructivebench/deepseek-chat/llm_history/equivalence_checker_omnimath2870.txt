theorem omnimath2870 : omnimath2870_answer = 11/120 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: (1/12 + 1/10) / 2
Proposed Answer: 1/2 - 1/3 + 1/4 - 1/5
Let's evaluate both expressions to see if they are equivalent:

Ground Truth: (1/12 + 1/10)/2 = (5/60 + 6/60)/2 = (11/60)/2 = 11/120

Proposed Answer: 1/2 - 1/3 + 1/4 - 1/5 
= (30/60 - 20/60) + (15/60 - 12/60)
= (10/60) + (3/60)
= 13/60

13/60 ≠ 11/120, so the answers are not equivalent.
