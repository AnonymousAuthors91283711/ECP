Ground Truth Answer: 651
Proposed Answer: 507
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a system of two equations involving averages of a set S before and after inserting elements 1 and 2001.

2. The ground truth answer is 651, which is known to be the correct solution to this AIME problem.

3. The proposed answer is 507, which differs significantly from the correct answer.

4. The problem involves solving for the average of set S, and the correct solution involves setting up and solving the given equations properly to arrive at 651.

Since 507 ≠ 651 and there's no indication that these could represent equivalent forms of the same solution, the answers are not equivalent.
