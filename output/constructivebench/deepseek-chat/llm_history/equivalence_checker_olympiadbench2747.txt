Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: 12
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n such that 1/2^n < 1/6084.

2. We can rewrite the inequality as 2^n > 6084.

3. Calculating powers of 2:
   - 2^12 = 4096
   - 2^13 = 8192

4. Comparing with 6084:
   - 4096 < 6084 (so n=12 doesn't satisfy the inequality)
   - 8192 > 6084 (so n=13 satisfies the inequality)

The ground truth answer (13) is correct since it's the smallest n where 2^n > 6084. The proposed answer (12) is incorrect because 2^12 = 4096 < 6084.

<<<False>>>
