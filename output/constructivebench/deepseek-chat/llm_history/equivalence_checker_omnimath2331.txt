abbrev omnimath2331_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath2331 (n : ℕ) (b : ℕ) (hn : n ≥ 2) (hb : b ≥ 2) :
    (n : ℚ) / (n + b) * (b : ℚ) / (n + b - 1) = omnimath2331_answer ↔ n = 10 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 19/100
Proposed Answer: 1 / 11
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is stating an equality that should hold when n=10, for any b ≥ 2
2. The ground truth answer is 19/100
3. The proposed answer is 1/11

Let's test with n=10 and some arbitrary b ≥ 2:

For b=2:
Left side = (10)/(12) * (2)/(11) = (10*2)/(12*11) = 20/132 = 5/33 ≈ 0.1515
Ground truth: 19/100 = 0.19
Proposed: 1/11 ≈ 0.0909

None of these match the actual calculation (5/33), but the problem seems to be about finding what omnimath2331_answer should be when n=10.

The ground truth (19/100) and proposed (1/11) answers are clearly different (0.19 vs 0.0909), and neither matches the actual calculation for b=2.
