Ground Truth Answer: 6 * 5 * 4 * (6 * 5 * 4 / 6)
Proposed Answer: 6 * 5 * choose (6 * 5) 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
We need to count the number of 3-element subsets of Fin 6 × Fin 6 where:
1. All elements have distinct first coordinates
2. All elements have distinct second coordinates

This is equivalent to counting the number of ways to place 3 non-attacking rooks on a 6×6 chessboard.

Ground Truth Answer:
6 * 5 * 4 * (6 * 5 * 4 / 6)
- First part (6*5*4): Choose 3 distinct rows (6 choices for first, 5 for second, 4 for third)
- Second part (6*5*4/6): Choose 3 distinct columns, divided by 6 to account for ordering (since we've already ordered the rows)

Proposed Answer:
6 * 5 * choose (6 * 5) 2
- This seems incorrect because:
  1. The first part (6*5) only chooses 2 rows, not 3
  2. The choose(6*5,2) part doesn't properly account for column constraints
  3. The structure doesn't match the problem requirements

The proposed answer doesn't correctly count the valid configurations. The ground truth answer properly accounts for both row and column constraints while the proposed answer doesn't maintain the required constraints on both dimensions.
