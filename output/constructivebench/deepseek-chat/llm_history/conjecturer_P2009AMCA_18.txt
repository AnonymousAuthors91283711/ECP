Looking at the pattern of enumerated answers (which I assume show values of n for different k), we notice that for k=1, n=5; k=2, n=6; k=3, n=7; etc. The pattern suggests n = k + 4. The maximum value occurs when k is largest, but since the problem asks for the greatest n in the set, we need to consider the limit as k grows. However, since padicValNat measures the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization, and 10^(k+2) + 64 grows rapidly, the maximum padicValNat appears to be unbounded. But since the problem asks for IsGreatest, which implies existence of a maximum, there must be a point where the pattern breaks. Based on the initial pattern, the answer is:

<<<7>>>
