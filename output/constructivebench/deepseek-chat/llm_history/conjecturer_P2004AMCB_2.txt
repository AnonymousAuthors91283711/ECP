  IsGreatest {x : ℕ | ∃ (a b c d : ℕ), 
    ({a, b, c, d} : Set ℕ) = {0, 1, 2, 3} ∧ x = c * a^b - d} 
  P2004AMCB_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the enumerated answers and considering all permutations of {0,1,2,3} for (a,b,c,d), the maximum value occurs when we maximize c*a^b - d. The optimal assignment is c=3, a=2, b=1, d=0, giving 3*2^1 - 0 = 6.
