Ground Truth Answer: -3
Proposed Answer: -4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have two equations:
   - x - y = 4
   - x³ - y³ = 28

2. We know that x³ - y³ can be factored as (x - y)(x² + xy + y²)

3. From the first equation, we can substitute x - y = 4 into the second equation:
   4(x² + xy + y²) = 28 ⇒ x² + xy + y² = 7

4. From x - y = 4, we can express x = y + 4 and substitute into the above equation:
   (y + 4)² + (y + 4)y + y² = 7
   y² + 8y + 16 + y² + 4y + y² = 7
   3y² + 12y + 16 = 7
   3y² + 12y + 9 = 0
   y² + 4y + 3 = 0
   (y + 1)(y + 3) = 0

5. Solutions: y = -1 or y = -3
   - If y = -1, then x = 3 ⇒ xy = -3
   - If y = -3, then x = 1 ⇒ xy = -3

In both cases, xy = -3, which matches the ground truth answer. The proposed answer of -4 is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
