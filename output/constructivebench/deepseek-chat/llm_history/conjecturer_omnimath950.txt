<<<2^50 * 50!>>> 

Explanation: The problem counts injective functions from Fin 100 to Fin 2 × Fin 50 with adjacency conditions. The pattern suggests we first choose 50 distinct second components (50! ways) and then assign binary first components (2^50 ways). The adjacency condition is automatically satisfied by this construction.
