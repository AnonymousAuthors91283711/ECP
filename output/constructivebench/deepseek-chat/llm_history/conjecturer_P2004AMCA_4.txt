theorem P2004AMCA_4 :
  ∃ (d : ℕ) (gd : ℕ) (x : ℕ),
    d = 6 ∧
    d + gd = 30 ∧
    x ≤ d ∧
    gd = 6 * x ∧
    d + (gd - x) = P2004AMCA_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the constraints:
1. d = 6 (given)
2. d + gd = 30 ⇒ gd = 24
3. gd = 6*x ⇒ 24 = 6*x ⇒ x = 4
4. Final answer is d + (gd - x) = 6 + (24 - 4) = 26
