open Nat Function

abbrev omnimath1749_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1749 : 
  let f := fun x : ℕ => x^2 - 2
  let f24 := iterate f 24
  f24 18 % 89 = omnimath1749_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern of iterated function application modulo 89, we observe that after 24 iterations of f(x) = x² - 2 starting from 18, the result cycles back to the initial value due to the modulus's properties. The answer is simply 18 mod 89.
