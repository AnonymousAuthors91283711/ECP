Ground Truth Answer: 1980
Proposed Answer: 2 * 3 * 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a system of equations involving three distinct primes p, q, r and a variable A.
2. The ground truth answer is 1980.
3. The proposed answer is 2 * 3 * 5 = 30.

The proposed answer (30) is clearly different from the ground truth answer (1980). The proposed answer appears to be just the product of three small primes, which doesn't match the complex equation given in the problem.
