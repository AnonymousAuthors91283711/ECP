Ground Truth Answer: 193
Proposed Answer: 79 * 77 - 77 - 79
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal sum a+b where a and b are positive integers satisfying:
   - 79 divides (a + 77*b)
   - 77 divides (a + 79*b)

2. The ground truth answer is 193.

3. The proposed answer is 79*77 - 77 - 79 = 79*77 - 156 = 5929 - 156 = 5773

4. Clearly, 5773 ≠ 193, so the proposed answer is incorrect.

5. The correct minimal solution is indeed 193 (for example with a=116, b=77).
