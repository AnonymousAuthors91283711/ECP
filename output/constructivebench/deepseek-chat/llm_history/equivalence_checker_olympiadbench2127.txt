Ground Truth Answer: fun n k => 2^(k - n)
Proposed Answer: fun n k => if k < n then 0 else choose (k - 1) (n - 1)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting certain types of functions (σ) with parity constraints on their fibers. The ground truth answer suggests this count relates to powers of 2 based on the difference between k and n.

2. The proposed answer uses binomial coefficients (choose) with a conditional, which is structurally different from the ground truth's exponential form.

3. The conditions in the problem (n ≤ k and matching parity) aren't reflected in the proposed answer's structure. The ground truth answer naturally handles the parity condition through the exponentiation.

4. The combinatorial interpretation doesn't match - binomial coefficients typically count subsets, while the problem seems to require counting parity-constrained functions.

5. The proposed answer's conditional (k < n) is redundant since the theorem has n ≤ k as a hypothesis.
