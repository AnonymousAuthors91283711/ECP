Ground Truth Answer: 15
Proposed Answer: 125
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest natural number n such that the volume of n spheres of radius 4 is less than or equal to the volume of one sphere of radius 10.

2. The volume calculation simplifies to:
   n * (4/3 * π * 4³) ≤ (4/3 * π * 10³)
   which simplifies to:
   n * 4³ ≤ 10³
   or n * 64 ≤ 1000

3. Solving for n:
   n ≤ 1000/64 ≈ 15.625

4. Since n must be a natural number, the greatest such n is 15.

The proposed answer of 125 is incorrect because:
- 125 * 64 = 8000 which is much greater than 1000
- The correct calculation shows n should be 15

<<<False>>>
