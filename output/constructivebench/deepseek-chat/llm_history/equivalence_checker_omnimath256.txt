Ground Truth Answer: {p | let (a, b) := p; |a| = |b|}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b) | a = b} ∪ {(1, -1), (-1, 1)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all pairs (a,b) where there exist functions f,g: ℤ→ℤ such that:
   - f(g(x)) = x + a
   - g(f(x)) = x + b

2. Ground truth answer: All pairs where |a| = |b|
3. Proposed answer: All pairs where a = b, plus the specific pairs (1,-1) and (-1,1)

The proposed answer is missing many cases where |a| = |b| but a ≠ b and (a,b) ≠ (±1,∓1). For example:
- (2,-2)
- (-3,3)
- (4,4) is already covered by a=b
- etc.

The proposed answer only captures a subset of the correct solution. It's correct for the cases it includes, but misses many others.
