Looking at the custom sequence definition and the pattern of 2-adic and 5-adic valuations, we observe that the minimum valuation alternates between 2 and 5 valuations in a predictable pattern. For n=14 (even), the minimum valuation comes from the 5-adic valuation, which follows a Fibonacci-like pattern. The answer should be 377.
