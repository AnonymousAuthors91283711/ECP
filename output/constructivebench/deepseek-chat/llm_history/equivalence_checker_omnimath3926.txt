theorem omnimath3926 : fn 1991 (2^1990) = omnimath3926_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 256
Proposed Answer: 4
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive function `fn` that applies `f1` (sum of digits squared) repeatedly 1991 times starting from 2^1990.

2. The key observation is that repeatedly applying the "sum of digits squared" operation to any number eventually reaches a single-digit number or enters a small cycle. For this operation, numbers eventually reach either:
   - 1 (which stays 1)
   - 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → 89 → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4 (cycle of length 8)
   - Or get stuck at other fixed points like 256 (since 2²+5²+6²=4+25+36=65 → 6²+5²=61 → 6²+1²=37 → ... eventually reaching the 4-cycle)

3. The ground truth answer is 256, which is indeed a fixed point (2²+5²+6²=4+25+36=65 → 6²+5²=61 → 6²+1²=37 → ... eventually cycles back).

4. The proposed answer is 4, which is part of the cycle but not the fixed point that 2^1990 would eventually reach after 1991 iterations.

The answers are different (256 ≠ 4) and represent different points in the iteration process. The proposed answer is incorrect.
