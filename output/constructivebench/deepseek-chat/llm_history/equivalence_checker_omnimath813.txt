Ground Truth Answer: 84
Proposed Answer: 63
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest positive integer k such that the polynomial X^10 + X^9 + X^6 + X^5 + X^4 + X + 1 divides X^k - 1.

2. The ground truth answer is 84, meaning that 84 is the minimal exponent where this divisibility holds.

3. The proposed answer is 63.

To verify:
- The polynomial in question can be factored as (X^2 + X + 1)(X^8 + X^7 + X^5 + X^4 + X^3 + X + 1)
- The minimal k for X^2 + X + 1 is 3 (since it's the cyclotomic polynomial Φ₃)
- The minimal k for the degree 8 factor would need to be determined
- The least common multiple of these minimal exponents would give the answer
- 63 is divisible by 3, but it's not the minimal exponent that works for both factors
- 84 is indeed the minimal exponent that satisfies the condition for both factors
