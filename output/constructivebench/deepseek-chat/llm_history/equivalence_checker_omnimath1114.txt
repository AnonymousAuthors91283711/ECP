abbrev omnimath1114_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1114 : 
  Fintype.card {s : Fin 36 → Fin 10 | let sum := (univ.sum s) % 10; sum ∉ Set.range s} = omnimath1114_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 9^36 + 4
Proposed Answer: 9 * 10^35
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
- We're counting the number of functions from Fin 36 → Fin 10 where the sum of all outputs mod 10 is not in the range of the function.
- The ground truth answer is 9^36 + 4
- The proposed answer is 9 * 10^35

Comparison:
1. Total number of functions is 10^36 (since each of 36 positions has 10 choices)
2. The ground truth suggests that almost all functions (9^36) satisfy the condition, plus 4 special cases
3. The proposed answer suggests a count of 9 * 10^35, which is 90% of total functions

Evaluation:
- The proposed answer is incorrect because:
  - It suggests a linear relationship (90%) when the actual condition is more complex
  - The ground truth shows an exponential relationship (9^36) plus a constant
  - The proposed answer doesn't account for the special cases (+4)
  - The magnitudes are different: 9^36 ≈ 1.5×10^34 while 9*10^35 = 9×10^35
