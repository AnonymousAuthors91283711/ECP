Ground Truth Answer: {1, 100, 101, 201}
Proposed Answer: {k | 202 % k = 0 ∧ k % 2 = 0}
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is about finding natural numbers k (0 < k < 202) where there exists an n such that the sum of fractional parts equals k/2. The ground truth gives specific numbers {1, 100, 101, 201}.

The proposed answer suggests numbers k where:
1. 202 is divisible by k (202 % k = 0)
2. k is even (k % 2 = 0)

Let's check the proposed answer against ground truth:
- For k=1: 202%1=0 and 1%2=1 → doesn't satisfy both conditions
- For k=100: 202%100=2 ≠0 → doesn't satisfy
- For k=101: 202%101=0 but 101%2=1 → doesn't satisfy both
- For k=201: 202%201=1 ≠0 → doesn't satisfy

The proposed answer doesn't match any of the ground truth values. Moreover, the only k satisfying both conditions (202%k=0 and k%2=0) in 0<k<202 would be k=2 (since 202=2×101), but 2 isn't in the ground truth.
