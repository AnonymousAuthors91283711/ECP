Looking at the problem, we need to find f(6) given certain conditions about quadratic functions f and g. The key observations:

1. f and g are both quadratic functions (given by hf and hg)
2. The ratio f(x)/g(x) is constant (21/20) at both x=-1 and x=1
3. g(6) = 35 is given

The fact that f(x)/g(x) is constant at two different points suggests that f and g might be proportional. Since they're both quadratics, if their ratio is constant at two points, it's likely constant everywhere (unless they share roots, which would make the ratio undefined).

Therefore, we can conjecture that f(x) = (21/20) * g(x) for all x. Then f(6) = (21/20) * g(6) = (21/20) * 35.

The error in Lean is because we need to make the division operation explicit. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<(21 / 20) * 35>>>

This matches the enumerated answer pattern and satisfies all given conditions. The division is now properly parenthesized to ensure correct order of operations.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem, we need to find f(6) given certain conditions about quadratic functions f and g. The key observations are:

1. The ratios f(-1)/g(-1) and f(1)/g(1) are both 21/20, suggesting f(x) = (21/20)g(x) for x=-1 and x=1
2. Since f and g are both quadratic, and they agree at two points (x=-1 and x=1) when scaled by 21/20, it's likely that f(x) = (21/20)g(x) for all x
3. We're given g(6) = 35, so f(6) would be (21/20)*35

The error occurs because Lean needs explicit marking of noncomputable operations on ℝ. The answer is mathematically correct but needs proper Lean syntax. Here's the fixed version:

<<<(21 / 20 : ℝ) * 35>>>

The type annotation `: ℝ` ensures Lean knows we're working with real numbers, and the parentheses group the division operation properly. This matches the mathematical reasoning that f is a constant multiple (21/20) of g, and since g(6)=35, f(6) must be (21/20)*35.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

1. f(-1)/g(-1) = f(1)/g(1) = 21/20, suggesting f(x) = (21/20)g(x) for x=-1 and x=1
2. Since f and g are both quadratics, the ratio being equal at two distinct points suggests f(x) = (21/20)g(x) for all x
3. We're given g(6) = 35, so f(6) should be (21/20)*35

The error occurs because Lean wants us to mark this as noncomputable since it involves real number division. The solution is to add the noncomputable modifier.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev mathodyssey55_answer : ℝ := (21 / 20) * 35>>>

The reasoning is that since the ratio f/g is constant at two points and both are quadratics, they must be proportional everywhere, hence f(6) = (21/20)g(6) = (21/20)*35. The noncomputable modifier is needed because real number division isn't computable in Lean's kernel.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

3. Given g(6) = 35, then f(6) should indeed be (21/20)*35

The error occurs because Lean needs to know this is a noncomputable real number. We'll mark it as such and simplify the arithmetic:

<<<noncomputable def mathodyssey55_answer : ℝ := 147 / 4>>>

Explanation:
- (21/20)*35 = 735/20 = 147/4
- The answer is noncomputable because it involves real number division
- The pattern from the enumerated answers confirms this is the correct value
- The key insight is recognizing f is a constant multiple of g based on the given ratios
