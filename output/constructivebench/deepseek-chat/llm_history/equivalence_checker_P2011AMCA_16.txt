Ground Truth Answer: 3120
Proposed Answer: 6 * 5 * 5 * 4 * 4
Let me analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem is counting the number of functions from Fin 5 (a 5-element set) to Fin 6 (a 6-element set) where for any two indices i,j whose difference (mod 5) is 2 or 3, the function values must be different.

This is equivalent to counting proper colorings of a graph where:
- Vertices are elements of Fin 5
- Edges connect vertices whose difference is 2 or 3
- Colors are elements of Fin 6

The graph structure is a 5-cycle with additional chords connecting vertices at distance 2. This is actually the complete graph K₅ minus the edges between consecutive vertices (difference 1 or 4).

The proposed answer 6 * 5 * 5 * 4 * 4 suggests:
1. First element has 6 choices
2. Second element has 5 choices (must differ from first)
3. Third element has 5 choices (must differ from first)
4. Fourth element has 4 choices (must differ from first and second)
5. Fifth element has 4 choices (must differ from second and third)

This matches the constraints since:
- f(0) ≠ f(2), f(0) ≠ f(3)
- f(1) ≠ f(3), f(1) ≠ f(4)
- f(2) ≠ f(4), f(2) ≠ f(0)
- etc.

Calculating 6*5*5*4*4 = 6*25*16 = 2400, which doesn't match the ground truth 3120. However, the approach seems correct but the calculation might be wrong.

Wait, let's compute 6*5*5*4*4:
6*5 = 30
30*5 = 150
150*4 = 600
600*4 = 2400

But the ground truth is 3120. The proposed answer is incorrect in the final calculation, though the approach seems reasonable.
