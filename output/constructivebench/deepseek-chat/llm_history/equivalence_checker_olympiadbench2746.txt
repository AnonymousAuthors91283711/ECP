theorem olympiadbench2746 :
  1 / (Nat.choose 13 2 * Nat.choose 13 2) = olympiadbench2746_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1 / 6084
Proposed Answer: 1 / (78 * 78)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer because:
1. Nat.choose 13 2 = 13! / (2! * 11!) = (13*12)/2 = 78
2. Therefore, Nat.choose 13 2 * Nat.choose 13 2 = 78 * 78 = 6084
3. Thus, 1 / (78 * 78) = 1 / 6084

The expressions are mathematically identical, just written in different forms.
