Ground Truth Answer: fun m => m * π - π / 4
Proposed Answer: fun m : ℤ => π / 4 + m * π / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for all real numbers x that satisfy the trigonometric equation:
   sin³x(1 + cotx) + cos³x(1 + tanx) = cos(2x)

2. The ground truth answer suggests solutions at x = mπ - π/4 for any integer m.

3. The proposed answer suggests solutions at x = π/4 + mπ/2.

Let's test some integer values of m:

For m=0:
- Ground truth: x = -π/4
- Proposed: x = π/4
Both satisfy the original equation.

For m=1:
- Ground truth: x = 3π/4
- Proposed: x = π/4 + π/2 = 3π/4
Both give same solution.

For m=2:
- Ground truth: x = 7π/4
- Proposed: x = π/4 + π = 5π/4
These are different solutions, but both satisfy the equation.

For m=-1:
- Ground truth: x = -5π/4
- Proposed: x = π/4 - π/2 = -π/4
Both satisfy the equation.

The proposed answer is actually giving a subset of solutions (every other solution from the ground truth). While both forms satisfy the equation, they don't represent exactly the same set of solutions. The ground truth gives all solutions, while the proposed answer gives only half of them.
