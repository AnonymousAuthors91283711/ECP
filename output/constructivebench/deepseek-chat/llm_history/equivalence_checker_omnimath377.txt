Ground Truth Answer: 1/4
Proposed Answer: 1/5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the probability that the sum of two dice (each with faces 1-6) is divisible by 5.

2. There are 36 possible outcomes (6 × 6) when rolling two dice.

3. The sums divisible by 5 between 2 (1+1) and 12 (6+6) are: 5 and 10.

4. Number of ways to get:
   - Sum of 5: (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1) → 4 ways
   - Sum of 10: (4,6), (5,5), (6,4) → 3 ways
   Total favorable outcomes: 4 + 3 = 7

5. Probability = favorable/total = 7/36 ≈ 0.1944

6. Ground truth says 1/4 = 0.25 (9 outcomes)
7. Proposed answer says 1/5 = 0.2 (7.2 outcomes)

Both answers are incorrect compared to the exact calculation (7/36). However, the proposed answer (1/5) is closer to the exact value (0.1944 vs 0.2) than the ground truth (0.25).

But since neither matches the exact answer, and they're both different from each other:

<<<False>>>
