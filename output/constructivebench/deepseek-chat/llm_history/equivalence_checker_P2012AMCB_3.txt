Ground Truth Answer: 48
Proposed Answer: 16
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a system of equations:
   - 3c = 4s
   - c = s + 4
   - 3c = answer

2. Solving the system:
   From c = s + 4, we can substitute into the first equation:
   3(s + 4) = 4s → 3s + 12 = 4s → s = 12
   Then c = 12 + 4 = 16
   Therefore 3c = 3*16 = 48

3. The ground truth answer is 48 (correct)
4. The proposed answer is 16 (which is c, not 3c)

The proposed answer gives the value of c rather than 3c as required by the problem. Therefore, it's incorrect.
