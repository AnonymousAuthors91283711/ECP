<<<4 / 27>>> 

Explanation: The problem involves symmetric polynomials in r, s, t with constraints. The enumerated solutions suggest the maximum b value occurs when two variables are equal and one is different, leading to the pattern 4/27. This matches the maximum of the symmetric expression under given constraints.
