abbrev P2006AMCB_4_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2006AMCB_4 : 
  IsLeast {p : ℝ | ∃ (change : ℝ), 
    change = 20 - (7.99 + 4.99 + 2.99 + 1.99 + 0.99) ∧ 
    p = |(change / 20 * 100) - P2006AMCB_4_answer|} 0 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<1.0>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks for the percentage difference between the actual change and expected change to be minimized (0). The enumerated answer shows the difference is exactly 1%, so the answer is 1.0. The calculation comes from (20 - sum of prices) / 20 * 100 = 1%.
