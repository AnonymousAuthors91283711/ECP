Ground Truth Answer: 49998
Proposed Answer: 40000
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a 300×300 grid with certain constraints:
   - Four 100×100 corner regions must be entirely false
   - The rest can be either true or false
   - No 2×2 block can have a checkerboard pattern
   - We need to find the maximum number of adjacent cell pairs with different values

2. The ground truth answer (49998) comes from:
   - The grid is divided into two regions (true and false) with a single boundary
   - The maximum boundary length occurs when the boundary is diagonal
   - For a 300×300 grid, the maximum boundary is 2×300-2 = 598
   - But we have 4 constrained 100×100 corners, reducing possible boundary length
   - The optimal configuration gives 49998 differing adjacent pairs

3. The proposed answer (40000) is significantly lower than the ground truth. It seems to be calculating something like:
   - 200×200 center region (since corners are fixed)
   - Assuming 200×200 = 40000 differing pairs
   - But this doesn't account for the optimal boundary configuration

The proposed answer doesn't match the optimal solution and appears to be based on incorrect reasoning about the grid configuration.
