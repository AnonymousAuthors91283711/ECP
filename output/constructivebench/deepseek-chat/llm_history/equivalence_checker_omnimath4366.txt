  (1 + (x : ℚ) / (y + z))^2 + (1 + (y : ℚ) / (z + x))^2 + (1 + (z : ℚ) / (x + y))^2 = 27/4

Ground Truth Answer: { (x, y, z) | x = y ∧ y = z }
Proposed Answer: { (k, k, k) | k ∈ Set.univ \ {0} } ∪ { (k, k, 4*k) | k ∈ Set.univ \ {0} } ∪ { (k, 4*k, k) | k ∈ Set.univ \ {0} } ∪ { (4*k, k, k) | k ∈ Set.univ \ {0} }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all positive natural number triples (x,y,z) that satisfy the given equation.

2. The ground truth answer states that the only solutions are when x=y=z (all three variables are equal).

3. The proposed answer includes:
   - All cases where x=y=z (first set)
   - Plus additional cases where two variables are equal and the third is 4 times that value (last three sets)

Testing the proposed additional solutions:
Take (k,k,4k):
Substitute into equation:
(1 + k/(k+4k))² + (1 + k/(4k+k))² + (1 + 4k/(k+k))²
= (1 + 1/5)² + (1 + 1/5)² + (1 + 2)²
= (6/5)² + (6/5)² + 3²
= 36/25 + 36/25 + 9
= 72/25 + 225/25
= 297/25 ≈ 11.88 ≠ 27/4 (6.75)

The proposed additional solutions don't satisfy the equation. Only the x=y=z case works.
