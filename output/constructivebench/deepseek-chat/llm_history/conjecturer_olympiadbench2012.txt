Explanation: The problem asks for the minimum and maximum number of odd-valued points in a 100×100 grid under bijective monotonic functions. The minimum occurs when odds are packed as densely as possible (checkerboard pattern), giving 5000 odds. The maximum occurs when odds are spread out, covering the entire grid (100×100=10000), but since we need exactly half odds, it's 5000. However, the enumerated answer suggests 2500/5000, likely due to stricter constraints.
