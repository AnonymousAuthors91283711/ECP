<<<True>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks if there exists a sequence of 2002 distinct positive integers such that for any n ≥ 2001, at least one term k_i in the sequence makes k_i*2^n+1 prime. Since prime numbers are infinite and satisfy such conditions (Dirichlet's theorem), such a sequence must exist.
