abbrev omnimath3588_answer : Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath3588 :
  (∃ p : ℕ, p.Prime ∧ (∃ k ≥ 1, p = 3 * 10^(2 + k) + 8 * 10^(1 + k) + ∑ i in Finset.range k, 10^i)) ↔ omnimath3588_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Prop
<<<True>>> 

Explanation: The enumerated pattern shows primes of form 3888...8 (with k 8's) exist for certain k. Since infinitely many such primes likely exist (Dirichlet's theorem), the existential statement is true.
