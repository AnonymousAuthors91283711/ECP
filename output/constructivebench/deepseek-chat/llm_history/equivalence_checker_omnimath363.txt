theorem omnimath363 (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) :
  ∀ (a : ℕ → ℕ), 
    (a 1 = 1) ∧ 
    (∀ i, i < n → a (i + 1) ≤ a i + 1) → 
    (∑ i in Finset.range n, ∏ j in Finset.range (i + 1), a (j + 1)) = omnimath363_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2 * n - 1)!!
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 2^(n - 1)
<<<False>>>
