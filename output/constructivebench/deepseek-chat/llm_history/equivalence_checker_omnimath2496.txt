Ground Truth Answer: 7
Proposed Answer: 23
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find three prime numbers p, q, r such that:
   - 2p + 3q = 6r
   - p + q + r equals some answer (which we're trying to find)

2. Ground truth answer is 7. Let's verify this:
   - The only solution is p=2, q=3, r=2 (all primes)
   - 2*2 + 3*3 = 4 + 9 = 13 ≠ 6*2 = 12 → Doesn't satisfy the equation
   - Wait, this suggests the ground truth might be incorrect. Let me find the actual solution.

3. Looking for primes satisfying 2p + 3q = 6r:
   - Let's try p=3, q=5, r=3:
     2*3 + 3*5 = 6 + 15 = 21 = 6*3.5 → r not integer
   - Try p=3, q=3, r=2.5 → invalid
   - Try p=5, q=3, r=3.166... → invalid
   - Try p=3, q=7, r=4.5 → invalid
   - Try p=7, q=5, r=4.833... → invalid
   - Try p=5, q=7, r=5.166... → invalid
   - Try p=2, q=5, r=2.666... → invalid
   - Try p=5, q=2, r=2.666... → invalid

4. The proposed answer is 23, but none of the combinations I tried sum to 23 while satisfying the equation. The ground truth answer 7 also doesn't seem to work with any prime combination.

5. After more exhaustive checking, there appears to be no solution with natural primes satisfying both conditions.
