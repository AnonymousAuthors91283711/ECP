The error occurs because Lean doesn't know how to handle integer exponents (ℤ) with natural number bases (ℕ). We need to either:
1. Cast 2016 to ℤ before exponentiation, or
2. Use ℕ for the exponent and then cast the result to ℤ

Looking at the problem context, since we're working with ℤ × ℤ × ℤ and the exponent k is in ℤ, the first approach makes more sense. We'll use (2016 : ℤ)^k to properly handle the exponentiation.

The proposed solution pattern shows triples where the numbers are consecutive integers centered around a power of 2016, which matches the form (2016^k - 1, 2016^k, 2016^k + 1) and its permutation.

Here's the fixed answer:

<<<{ (x, y, z) | ∃ k : ℤ, (x, y, z) = ((2016 : ℤ)^k + 1, (2016 : ℤ)^k, (2016 : ℤ)^k - 1) ∨ (x, y, z) = ((2016 : ℤ)^k - 1, (2016 : ℤ)^k, (2016 : ℤ)^k + 1) }>>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error occurs because Lean doesn't have a built-in definition for integer exponentiation (ℤ^ℤ). We need to modify the expression to use natural number exponents (ℕ) instead, since 2016^n is well-defined for n ∈ ℕ. The problem involves powers of 2016, and the enumerated answers suggest the pattern involves consecutive integers around 2016^k.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<{ (x, y, z) | ∃ k : ℕ, (x, y, z) = (2016^k + 1, 2016^k, 2016^k - 1) ∨ (x, y, z) = (2016^k - 1, 2016^k, 2016^k + 1) }>>>

Explanation:
1. Changed ∃ k : ℤ to ∃ k : ℕ since we only need non-negative exponents
2. Removed the type annotations (2016 : ℤ) as they're unnecessary (Lean can infer them)
3. Kept the same structure of consecutive integers around 2016^k
4. The pattern matches the problem's requirement that N = 2016^n for some n
5. The solution set consists of all triples that are consecutive integers centered around powers of 2016, in both possible orders
