From the problem, we're counting x ∈ [0,2020] where f(f(f(x))) = 17. The function f(x) = x(x - floor(x)) has periodicity 1 in its fractional part. The triple composition suggests looking at x ≡ k/7 mod 1 for k=0..6. The equation reduces to solving x^3 ≡ 17 mod 1 in appropriate intervals. The count is 2020*3 + 1 = 6061 solutions (3 per integer interval plus one extra at the end).
