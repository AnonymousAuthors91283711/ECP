Looking at the problem, we need to find the value of `a` that makes the two quadratic equations have the same solution set. The key insight is that for two quadratic equations to have identical solution sets, their coefficients must be proportional.

Given:
1. First equation: x² + (5b - T - a)x = T + 1
2. Second equation: 2x² + (T + 8a - 2)x = -10b

For these to be proportional, the ratios of coefficients must be equal:
1/2 = (5b-T-a)/(T+8a-2) = (T+1)/(-10b)

From T=20, we can solve these equations. Starting with the first and last terms:
1/2 = (20+1)/(-10b) ⇒ b = -21/5

Then substitute b into the middle ratio:
1/2 = (5*(-21/5)-20-a)/(20+8a-2) ⇒ a = 1/2

The error in Lean was due to needing to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real numbers. Here's the corrected answer:

Based on the problem statement, we need to find the value of `a` that makes the two quadratic equations have the same solution set. The error in the proposed answer is due to missing the `noncomputable` annotation for real number division in Lean.

Looking at the structure:
1. The equations must be equivalent (same roots)
2. We can compare coefficients after normalizing the equations
3. The given T=20 suggests simplification is possible

The answer should be a real number that satisfies the equation equivalence. The proposed 1/2 seems plausible but needs proper Lean syntax. Here's the corrected version:

<<<noncomputable abbrev olympiadbench2841_answer : ℝ := 1 / 2>>>

Explanation:
1. The equations must have identical coefficients when normalized
2. From the first equation: x² + (5b-20-a)x -21 = 0
3. Second equation normalized: x² + (28+8a-2)/2 x + (-10b)/2 = 0
4. Comparing coefficients suggests a=1/2 makes the equations compatible
5. The `noncomputable` annotation is needed for real number division in Lean[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
