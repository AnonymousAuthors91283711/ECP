abbrev omnimath1894_answer : Set (ℝ → ℝ) := sorry
theorem omnimath1894 :
  {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x y : ℝ, f (x ^ 2 + f y) = f (f x) + f (y ^ 2) + 2 * f (x * y)} = omnimath1894_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {fun x : ℝ => 0, fun x : ℝ => x ^ 2}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℝ, f = fun x => c * x} ∪ {f | ∃ c : ℝ, f = fun x => c - x^2}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all real-valued functions f:ℝ→ℝ that satisfy the functional equation:
   f(x² + f(y)) = f(f(x)) + f(y²) + 2f(xy) for all x,y ∈ ℝ

2. Ground truth gives two solutions: the zero function (f(x)=0) and the square function (f(x)=x²)

3. Proposed answer suggests:
   - All linear functions (f(x)=cx)
   - All functions of form f(x)=c-x²

Analysis:
- The zero function is included in both linear functions (c=0) and the ground truth.
- The square function is not in the proposed answer (it would require c=1 in second part but gives f(x)=1-x² ≠ x²)
- The proposed linear functions don't satisfy the equation (except c=0)
- The proposed c-x² functions don't satisfy the equation (except when c=0, which gives f(x)=-x², but this doesn't satisfy the original equation)

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect as it includes many functions that don't satisfy the equation and misses the x² solution.
