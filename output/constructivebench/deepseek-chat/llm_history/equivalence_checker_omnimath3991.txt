theorem omnimath3991 :
  ∃ (cake_price cupcake_price bagel_price : ℚ),
    (1*cake_price + 2*cupcake_price + 3*bagel_price = 3*cake_price + 1*bagel_price) ∧
    (3*cake_price + 1*bagel_price = 6*cupcake_price) ∧
    (2*cake_price + 2*bagel_price = omnimath3991_answer * cupcake_price) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 13/4
Proposed Answer: (5 : ℚ)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a system of 3 equations with 3 variables (cake_price, cupcake_price, bagel_price) and asks to find the value of omnimath3991_answer that satisfies all equations.

2. Let's solve the system step by step:
   - From the first equation: 1*cake + 2*cupcake + 3*bagel = 3*cake + 1*bagel
     Simplifies to: -2*cake + 2*cupcake + 2*bagel = 0
     Or: -cake + cupcake + bagel = 0 → cake = cupcake + bagel (Equation A)

   - From the second equation: 3*cake + 1*bagel = 6*cupcake
     Substitute Equation A: 3*(cupcake + bagel) + bagel = 6*cupcake
     Simplifies to: 3*cupcake + 4*bagel = 6*cupcake
     Or: 4*bagel = 3*cupcake → bagel = (3/4)*cupcake (Equation B)

   - From the third equation: 2*cake + 2*bagel = answer*cupcake
     Substitute Equations A and B: 2*(cupcake + (3/4)cupcake) + 2*(3/4)cupcake = answer*cupcake
     Simplifies to: 2*(7/4)cupcake + (6/4)cupcake = answer*cupcake
     Or: (14/4 + 6/4)cupcake = answer*cupcake → (20/4) = answer → answer = 5

The ground truth answer is 13/4 (3.25), but our calculation shows the correct answer is 5. The proposed answer matches our calculation, while the ground truth answer does not.
