theorem omnimath2210 :
  Set.ncard {p : ℤ × ℤ | (p.1 ^ 2 + p.2 ^ 2 < 2019) ∧ (p.1 ^ 2 + min p.1 p.2 = p.2 ^ 2 + max p.1 p.2)} = omnimath2210_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<2018>>> 

Explanation: The condition p.1^2 + min p.1 p.2 = p.2^2 + max p.1 p.2 implies symmetry around the line x=y. The inequality x² + y² < 2019 defines points inside a circle. The count matches the diameter (2*√2019 ≈ 89.8) squared minus 2, but enumeration suggests 2018.
