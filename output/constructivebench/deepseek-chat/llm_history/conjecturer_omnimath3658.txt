From the equation a² + b² + c² = a²b², we can observe that solutions occur when either:
1. Two variables are 0 and the third is arbitrary (0,0,c), (0,b,0), (a,0,0)
2. When one variable is 0 and the other two are ±1 (0,±1,±1), (±1,0,±1), (±1,±1,0)

<<<{(a, b, c) | (a = 0 ∧ b = 0) ∨ (a = 0 ∧ c = 0) ∨ (b = 0 ∧ c = 0) ∨ 
    (a = 0 ∧ (b = 1 ∨ b = -1) ∧ (c = 1 ∨ c = -1)) ∨ 
    (b = 0 ∧ (a = 1 ∨ a = -1) ∧ (c = 1 ∨ c = -1)) ∨ 
    (c = 0 ∧ (a = 1 ∨ a = -1) ∧ (b = 1 ∨ b = -1))}>>>
