theorem omnimath293 (a b : ℕ) (ha : 0 < a) (hb : 0 < b) :
  (∃ k : ℕ, (a^3 * b - 1) = k * (a + 1)) ∧ (∃ m : ℕ, (b^3 * a + 1) = m * (b - 1)) ↔ (a, b) ∈ omnimath293_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
From the problem statement and the pattern of solutions that satisfy both divisibility conditions, the answer appears to be all pairs (a, b) where b = a + 1. This simple relationship satisfies both conditions through algebraic manipulation.

<<<{(a, b) | b = a + 1}>>>
