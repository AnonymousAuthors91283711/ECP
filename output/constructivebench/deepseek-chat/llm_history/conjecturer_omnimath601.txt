The error occurs because `Finset.Icc` requires a type with `Preorder` and `LocallyFiniteOrder` instances, but `ℂ` doesn't have these properties. Instead, we should use the roots of unity to express the solution.

The problem involves finding all complex numbers `s` such that `s = 1/(1 - r)` where `r` is a 2013th root of `1/2013^2013`. The roots can be expressed using roots of unity.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<{s : ℂ | ∃ k : Fin 2013, s = 1 / (1 - (1 / 2013) * exp (2 * Real.pi * I * k / 2013))}>>>

Explanation:
1. We replace `Finset.Icc 1 2013` with `Fin 2013` since we're dealing with discrete roots of unity
2. The expression `(1 / 2013) * exp (2 * Real.pi * I * k / 2013)` correctly represents the 2013th roots of `1/2013^2013` when raised to the 2013th power
3. Each root corresponds to a different value of `k` from 0 to 2012 (represented by `Fin 2013`)
4. The set comprehension correctly captures all possible `s` values that satisfy the original equation

This solution avoids the ordering issues with `ℂ` while still capturing all the required roots through the roots of unity representation.
