From the problem statement and error message, I can see that:
1. The answer should be a constant integer (ℤ), not a function
2. The functional equation suggests a linear solution form f(x) = ax + b
3. The given conditions f(2016)=6102 and f(6102)=2016 provide two equations
4. Solving these gives a = -1 and b = 8118
5. Therefore f(1) = -1*1 + 8118 = 8117

The error occurred because the proposed answer was trying to define a function when it should just be a constant integer. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<8117>>>

Explanation:
The functional equation suggests a linear relationship. Using the two given points, we solve for the linear coefficients and evaluate at x=1. The answer is derived from f(x) = -x + 8118, which satisfies both the functional equation and the given conditions.
