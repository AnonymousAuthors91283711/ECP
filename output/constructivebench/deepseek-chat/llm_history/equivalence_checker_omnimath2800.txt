Ground Truth Answer: 209957
Proposed Answer: 2^5 * 3^8 + 5 + 8
Let's analyze the proposed answer:

1. The ground truth answer is 209957
2. The proposed answer is 2^5 * 3^8 + 5 + 8
   - Calculating this: 2^5=32, 3^8=6561
   - 32*6561=209952
   - 209952 + 5 + 8 = 209965

209965 ≠ 209957, so the answers are not equivalent.
