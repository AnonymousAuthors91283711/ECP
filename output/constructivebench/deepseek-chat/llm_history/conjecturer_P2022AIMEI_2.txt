From the problem statement and enumerated answers, we can see that the solution involves finding a 3-digit number (represented as abc) where:
1. Each digit a, b, c < 9
2. The number satisfies two equations based on digit permutations
3. The pattern suggests a symmetric solution

The answer is the number where all digits are equal, satisfying both equations. The only valid 3-digit number with this property is 333.
