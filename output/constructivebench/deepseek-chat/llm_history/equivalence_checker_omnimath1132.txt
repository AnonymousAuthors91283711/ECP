Ground Truth Answer: fun n k m => choose (choose n k) m
Proposed Answer: fun n k m => if k = 0 then 1 else choose (choose n k) m
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but differs in the special case when k=0. The ground truth answer counts all possible combinations of m subsets where each subset has exactly k elements. The proposed answer adds a special case for k=0, which might be correct depending on interpretation (since there's exactly one empty set when k=0), but this isn't reflected in the ground truth answer. The answers are equivalent for all k>0.
