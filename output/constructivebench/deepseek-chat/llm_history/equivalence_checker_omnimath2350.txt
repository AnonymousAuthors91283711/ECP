Ground Truth Answer: 20481 / 4096
Proposed Answer: 11/4
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about calculating the average number of bit transitions in binary representations of numbers from 0 to 4095 (since 4096 is excluded in Finset.range 4096).

2. The ground truth answer is 20481/4096, which is approximately 5.000244.

3. The proposed answer is 11/4, which is exactly 2.75.

4. Clearly, 5.000244 ≠ 2.75, so these answers are not equivalent.

The proposed answer is incorrect - it's significantly lower than the actual average number of bit transitions in binary numbers from 0 to 4095.

<<<False>>>
