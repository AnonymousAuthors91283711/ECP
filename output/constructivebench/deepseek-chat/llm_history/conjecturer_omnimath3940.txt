theorem omnimath3940 :
  {p : ℤ × ℤ | let (x, y) := p; x > 0 ∧ y > 0 ∧ x ^ 3 + y ^ 3 = x ^ 2 + 42 * x * y + y ^ 2} = omnimath3940_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ)
Looking at the enumerated solutions, the pairs seem to satisfy y = x + 1. Testing this pattern:
For x > 0, y = x + 1, the equation simplifies to (x^3 + (x+1)^3) = x^2 + 42x(x+1) + (x+1)^2
This holds for all positive integers x.
