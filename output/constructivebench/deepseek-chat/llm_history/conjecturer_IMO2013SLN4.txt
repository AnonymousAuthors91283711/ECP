. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: Prop
Based on the problem statement and error message, I need to provide a correct Lean proposition that matches the structure of the IMO problem. The problem is about showing that there's no sequence of digits (1-9) where infinitely many prefixes form perfect squares when read as reversed numbers.

The error occurs because the proposed answer was incomplete (missing closing parentheses) and not properly structured as a Prop. Here's the corrected version:

<<<¬∃ (a : ℕ → ℕ) (N : ℕ), (∀ n, 1 ≤ a n ∧ a n ≤ 9) ∧ (∀ k > N, ∃ m, ofDigits 10 (List.map a (List.range k).reverse) = m ∧ IsSquare m)>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem asks to show that no such sequence 'a' exists where:
   - Each digit is between 1 and 9 (∀ n, 1 ≤ a n ∧ a n ≤ 9)
   - Beyond some point N, all prefixes form perfect squares when reversed (∀ k > N, ∃ m, ... ∧ IsSquare m)
2. The corrected answer properly negates the existence (¬∃) of such a sequence and N
3. The structure matches the original problem statement exactly
4. All parentheses are properly closed
5. The type is Prop as required

The enumerated answers weren't provided, but this matches the logical structure of the problem and fixes the syntax errors in the original proposal.
