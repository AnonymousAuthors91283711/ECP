theorem omnimath3332 : 
  omnimath3332_answer = List.insertionSort (· ≤ ·) [5^56, 10^51, 17^35, 31^28] := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: [5^56, 31^28, 17^35, 10^51]
Proposed Answer: [17^35, 31^28, 10^51, 5^56]
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to sort the list [5^56, 10^51, 17^35, 31^28] in ascending order.
2. We need to compare the magnitudes of these large numbers.

Calculating logarithms (base 10) to compare:
- log(5^56) = 56*log(5) ≈ 56*0.699 ≈ 39.144
- log(10^51) = 51
- log(17^35) = 35*log(17) ≈ 35*1.230 ≈ 43.05
- log(31^28) = 28*log(31) ≈ 28*1.491 ≈ 41.748

Ordering by magnitude:
1. 5^56 ≈ 10^39.144 (smallest)
2. 31^28 ≈ 10^41.748
3. 17^35 ≈ 10^43.05
4. 10^51 ≈ 10^51 (largest)

Ground Truth Answer matches this ordering: [5^56, 31^28, 17^35, 10^51]
Proposed Answer is in reverse order: [17^35, 31^28, 10^51, 5^56]

The proposed answer is completely reversed from the correct order.
