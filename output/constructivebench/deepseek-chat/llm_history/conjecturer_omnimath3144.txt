Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 58, which is at "π^2 / 12)" in "noncomputable abbrev omnimath3144_answer : ℝ := Real.exp (π^2 / 12)", there is an error: unknown identifier 'π'.

The error occurs because `π` is not directly available in the current context. In Lean, we need to use `Real.pi` instead of `π`. The proposed answer is likely correct based on the pattern of infinite product evaluations and known mathematical results, where similar products often evaluate to expressions involving `exp(π²/k)` for some integer k.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<Real.exp (Real.pi^2 / 12)>>>

Explanation:
1. The error was simply due to using `π` instead of `Real.pi` in Lean
2. The form `exp(π²/12)` is reasonable because:
   - The infinite product resembles q-series and theta functions
   - Similar products often evaluate to exponential forms with π²
   - The denominator 12 appears in many related mathematical constants
3. The enumerated answers weren't provided, but this matches known mathematical patterns for such limits of infinite products
