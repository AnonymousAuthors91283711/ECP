Ground Truth Answer: fun (a, b) => a + b
Proposed Answer: fun (a, b) => (a * (a - 1) * b * (b - 1)) / 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves comparing two double sums and setting their difference equal to 1200. The ground truth answer suggests that when a + b = 21, this condition holds.

2. The proposed answer suggests a much more complex formula involving a*(a-1)*b*(b-1)/4.

3. Let's test with some values:
   - If a=10, b=11 (a+b=21):
     Ground truth: 21
     Proposed: (10*9*11*10)/4 = 9900/4 = 2475 ≠ 21
   - If a=6, b=15 (a+b=21):
     Ground truth: 21
     Proposed: (6*5*15*14)/4 = 6300/4 = 1575 ≠ 21

The proposed answer gives completely different results from the ground truth, and doesn't satisfy the condition a+b=21.
