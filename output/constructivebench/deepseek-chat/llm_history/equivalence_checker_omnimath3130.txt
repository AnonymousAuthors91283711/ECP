Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: 22
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation given is:
   1000w + 100x + 10y + z + 100x + 10y + z + 10y + z + z = 2014

2. Simplifying the left side:
   - Combine like terms:
     1000w + (100x + 100x) + (10y + 10y + 10y) + (z + z + z + z)
     = 1000w + 200x + 30y + 4z = 2014

3. The problem asks to prove this is equivalent to w + x + y + z = answer

4. The ground truth answer is 13, while the proposed answer is 22

5. Let's test with w=1 (minimum value):
   - 1000*1 + 200x + 30y + 4z = 2014
   - 200x + 30y + 4z = 1014
   - Maximum possible sum (x=9,y=9,z=9): 200*9 + 30*9 + 4*9 = 1800 + 270 + 36 = 2106
   - Minimum possible sum (x=0,y=0,z=0): 0
   - Actual solution would need to satisfy this equation and w+x+y+z=13

6. The proposed answer 22 is impossible because:
   - Maximum possible sum w+x+y+z = 9+9+9+9 = 36
   - But even if we take w=9 (maximum), the equation becomes:
     9000 + 200x + 30y + 4z = 2014 → impossible since 9000 > 2014

7. The ground truth answer 13 is plausible as it's within possible range (4 to 36) and can be verified with specific values.
