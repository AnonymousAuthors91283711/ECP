Ground Truth Answer: {P | ∃ (d : ℕ) (c : ℤ), P = X ^ d + C c ∨ P = - (X ^ d + C c) ∧ d > 0}
Proposed Answer: {Polynomial.X, -Polynomial.X} ∪ (Set.range (Polynomial.C : ℤ → ℤ[X])) ∪ (Set.range (fun k => Polynomial.C k - 2 * Polynomial.X))
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the set of integer polynomials P where if P takes integer values at two real points s and t, then it must also take an integer value at s*t.

2. The ground truth answer correctly identifies that these are polynomials of the form ±(X^d + c) where d > 0 and c is an integer. These are essentially monomials with a constant term.

3. The proposed answer includes:
   - X and -X (which are correct cases)
   - All constant polynomials (which are correct)
   - Polynomials of form C k - 2*X (which are incorrect as they don't satisfy the condition)

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It's missing most of the monomial cases (X^d for d>1)
- It incorrectly includes C k - 2*X cases
- The structure is completely different from the ground truth
