Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 14
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the sum of squares of all distinct real roots of the polynomial p(x) = x⁸ - 14x⁴ - 8x³ - x² + 1.

2. The ground truth answer is 8, meaning the sum of squares of all distinct real roots equals 8.

3. The proposed answer is 14, which is significantly different from the ground truth.

4. To verify, we can consider that:
   - The polynomial is even degree (8th degree)
   - The sum of squares of roots can be related to the coefficients through symmetric polynomials
   - The proposed answer 14 matches the coefficient of x⁴ term, but this is not how sum of squares of roots is calculated
   - The correct calculation would involve finding all roots or using relationships between coefficients and roots

Since the proposed answer (14) is clearly different from the verified correct answer (8), and there's no indication that these could represent equivalent expressions under different interpretations, we can conclude:

<<<False>>>
