  omnimath3431_answer ∉ {m : ℤ | ∃ n : ℤ, ∀ x : ℤ, (x + m) * (x + n) = x^2 + (m + n) * x + m * n ∧ m * n = -12} := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 5
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find an integer m that does NOT satisfy the condition where there exists an integer n such that:
   - (x + m)(x + n) = x² + (m+n)x + mn (which is always true by algebra)
   - m * n = -12

2. The ground truth answer is 5. Let's verify:
   - For m=5, we'd need n such that 5n=-12 ⇒ n=-12/5 which is not an integer
   - Therefore, 5 is correctly not in the set

3. The proposed answer is 4:
   - For m=4, we'd need n such that 4n=-12 ⇒ n=-3 (which is integer)
   - Thus, 4 is in the set (with n=-3), so it doesn't satisfy the condition of NOT being in the set

The proposed answer (4) is incorrect because it actually does belong to the set (with n=-3), while the problem asks for a number that does NOT belong to the set. The ground truth answer (5) is correct.
