abbrev omnimath1533_answer : Set (ℤ × ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath1533 (a b : ℤ) :
  (∃ m : ℤ, a^2 + 4*b = m^2) ∧ (∃ n : ℤ, b^2 + 4*a = n^2) ↔ (a, b) ∈ omnimath1533_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(-4, -4), (-5, -6), (-6, -5)} ∪ 
  {(0, k^2) | k : ℤ} ∪ 
  {(k^2, 0) | k : ℤ} ∪ 
  {(k, 1 - k) | k : ℤ}
Proposed Answer: {(0, 0), (0, -4), (-4, 0), (1, 1), (1, -5), (-5, 1), (4, 4), (16, 16)} ∪ {(a, b) | ∃ k : ℤ, (a, b) = (k^2 - k, k^2 - k)}
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer covers:
   - The symmetric pairs (-4,-4), (-5,-6), (-6,-5)
   - All pairs where one element is 0 and the other is a perfect square
   - All pairs where one element is a perfect square and the other is 0
   - All pairs (k, 1-k) for any integer k

2. Proposed Answer covers:
   - Some specific points (0,0), (0,-4), (-4,0), etc.
   - A parametric form (k^2 - k, k^2 - k)

Comparison:
- The proposed answer misses many cases from the ground truth:
  - It doesn't include all (0, k^2) and (k^2, 0) cases
  - It doesn't include the (k, 1-k) cases
  - The parametric form (k^2 - k, k^2 - k) is different from what's in the ground truth
- The proposed answer includes some points that are in the ground truth (like (0,0)), but is incomplete

The proposed answer is not equivalent to the ground truth as it misses many cases and includes a different parametric form.
