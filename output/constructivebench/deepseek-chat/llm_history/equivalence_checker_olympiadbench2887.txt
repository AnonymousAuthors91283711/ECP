Ground Truth Answer: 135432
Proposed Answer: 123354
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest number (IsLeast) that can be formed by permuting the digits [1,2,3,3,4,5] which is divisible by 264 (N % 264 = 0).

2. To be divisible by 264, a number must be divisible by 8, 3, and 11 (since 264 = 8 × 3 × 11).

3. Checking the ground truth answer 135432:
   - Divisible by 3? Sum of digits = 1+3+5+4+3+2 = 18 → divisible by 3
   - Divisible by 8? Last 3 digits 432 → 432/8 = 54 → divisible by 8
   - Divisible by 11? (1+5+3)-(3+4+2) = 9-9 = 0 → divisible by 11

4. Checking the proposed answer 123354:
   - Divisible by 3? Sum = 1+2+3+3+5+4 = 18 → divisible by 3
   - Divisible by 8? Last 3 digits 354 → 354/8 = 44.25 → not divisible by 8
   - Doesn't need to check 11 since it fails the 8 test

The proposed answer fails the divisibility by 8 test, while the ground truth answer satisfies all conditions. They are not equivalent.
