  P2013AIMEII_6_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: fun N : ℕ => 250. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 35, which is at "fun N : ℕ => 250" in "abbrev P2013AIMEII_6_answer : ℕ := fun N : ℕ => 250", there is an error: type mismatch
  fun N => 250
has type
  (N : ℕ) → ?m.18 N : Type (max 0 ?u.7)
but is expected to have type
  ℕ : Type
Possible Fix: Check if the expected type aligns with the provided type..

From the error message, we can see that the proposed answer should be a natural number (ℕ) rather than a function. The problem is asking for the smallest N such that in the range [1000N, 1000N+999], there's no perfect square. Looking at the enumerated answers and the problem context, the correct answer should be 250, since 250*1000 = 250000 and 251*1000 = 251000, and there are no perfect squares between these numbers (since 500^2 = 250000 and 501^2 = 251001, leaving a gap of 999 numbers without perfect squares).

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<250>>>
