Ground Truth Answer: 7/2
Proposed Answer: Real.log (Nat.factorial 128 / Nat.factorial 4) / Real.log (Nat.factorial 127 / Nat.factorial 3)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem gives us a sequence of equations:
(4 + n)^(x n) = (5 + n) for n = 0 to 123 (Finset.range 124)

We can solve for x n:
x n = log(5 + n)/log(4 + n)

The product of x n from n=0 to 123 would be:
∏ (log(5 + n)/log(4 + n)) from n=0 to 123

This forms a telescoping product where most terms cancel out, leaving:
(log(129)/log(4)) = log(129)/log(4)

But 129 = 128 + 1 and 4 = 3 + 1, which doesn't directly match the proposed answer.

The proposed answer is:
log(128!/4!)/log(127!/3!) = log(128*127*...*5)/log(127*126*...*4) = log(128!/4!)/log(127!/3!)

This simplifies to:
log(128*127*...*5)/log(127*126*...*4) = [log(128) + log(127) + ... + log(5)]/[log(127) + log(126) + ... + log(4)]

This doesn't match our telescoping product result of log(129)/log(4).

The ground truth answer is 7/2 = 3.5, while:
log(129)/log(4) ≈ 4.857/1.386 ≈ 3.504 which is very close to 7/2.

The proposed answer gives a different expression that doesn't simplify to 7/2.
