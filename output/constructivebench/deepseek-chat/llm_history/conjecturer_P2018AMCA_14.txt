From the problem statement and the logarithmic equation, we can deduce that we're looking for a positive rational solution x where 3x ≠ 1 and 2x ≠ 1. The equation relates logarithms with different bases and arguments. 

The solution likely involves converting the logarithmic equation into an exponential form and solving for x. The enumerated answer suggests a simple fraction as the solution.
