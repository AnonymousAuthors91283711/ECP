Ground Truth Answer: 81
Proposed Answer: 99
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding two-digit numbers a and b (both between 10 and 99) where:
   - 100a + b is a perfect square (m²)
   - 201a + b is also a perfect square (n²)
   - We need to find a + b

2. The ground truth answer is 81, which means there exists a pair (a,b) where a + b = 81 that satisfies these conditions.

3. The proposed answer is 99, suggesting a different pair where a + b = 99.

4. To verify, let's think about the difference between the two equations:
   n² - m² = (201a + b) - (100a + b) = 101a
   This means (n - m)(n + m) = 101a

5. Since 101 is prime, the possible factor pairs are limited. The most plausible solution would be when n - m = 1 and n + m = 101a, but this leads to a=1 which violates the constraints.

6. The correct solution actually comes from n - m = a and n + m = 101, leading to a=20, b=61 (a + b=81). The proposed answer 99 doesn't satisfy the original conditions when checked.
