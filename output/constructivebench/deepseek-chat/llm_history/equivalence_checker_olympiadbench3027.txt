Ground Truth Answer: fun T => 362
Proposed Answer: fun T => 400 - 2 * (19 + T)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a cubic polynomial equation in terms of X with roots a, b, c and asks us to find a² + b² + c² in terms of T.

2. From Vieta's formulas, we know:
   - a + b + c = 20 (coefficient of X²)
   - ab + ac + bc = 19 (coefficient of X)
   - abc = -T (constant term)

3. The identity for sum of squares is:
   a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + ac + bc)

4. Plugging in the Vieta's results:
   a² + b² + c² = 20² - 2*19 = 400 - 38 = 362

5. The proposed answer is 400 - 2*(19 + T), which would be correct only if T were 0 (since 362 = 400 - 2*19). The T term is incorrectly included in the calculation.

The ground truth answer correctly gives the constant 362, while the proposed answer incorrectly includes T in the formula.
