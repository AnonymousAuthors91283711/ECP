theorem omnimath1615 (z : ℂ) (hz : z^23 = 1) (hz_nonreal : z.im ≠ 0) :
    (∑ k ∈ Finset.range 23, 1 / (1 + z^k + z^(2*k))) = omnimath1615_answer z := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun z => if z^23 = 1 ∧ z.im ≠ 0 then 46 / 3 else 0
Proposed Answer: fun z : ℂ => (23 : ℂ) / 3
Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is about evaluating a sum of fractions involving powers of z, where z is a 23rd root of unity (z²³ = 1) with non-zero imaginary part.

2. The ground truth answer:
   - Returns 46/3 when z is a non-real 23rd root of unity
   - Returns 0 otherwise
   - The 46/3 comes from evaluating the sum for primitive roots

3. The proposed answer:
   - Always returns 23/3, regardless of whether z is a root of unity or not
   - Doesn't handle the case when z is not a root of unity
   - The value is exactly half of what it should be for valid z

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It doesn't include the conditional check
- It gives the wrong value (23/3 instead of 46/3) for valid z
- It doesn't return 0 for invalid z

<<<False>>>
