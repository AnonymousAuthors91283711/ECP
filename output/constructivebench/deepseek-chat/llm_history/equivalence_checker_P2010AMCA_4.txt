Ground Truth Answer: fun x => -x⁻¹
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℝ => -(-x)^(1/3)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function P2010AMCA_4_answer that satisfies several conditions for x < 0:
   - 0 < P2010AMCA_4_answer x (must be positive)
   - x/|x| ≤ 0 (true since x < 0)
   - -x² ≤ 0 (always true)
   - -2^x < 0 (always true)
   - x^(1/3) < 0 (true for x < 0)

2. Ground truth answer (-x⁻¹):
   - For x < 0, -x⁻¹ = -1/x is positive (since x is negative)
   - Satisfies all conditions

3. Proposed answer (-(-x)^(1/3)):
   - For x < 0, -x > 0, so (-x)^(1/3) > 0, thus -(-x)^(1/3) < 0
   - This fails the first condition (must be positive)

The proposed answer gives negative outputs when x < 0, while the ground truth gives positive outputs. They are not equivalent.
