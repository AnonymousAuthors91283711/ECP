Ground Truth Answer: 2028
Proposed Answer: 2023 + 13 * 45 + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n > 2023 such that the quadratic equation x² - 13x - n = 0 has integer solutions.

2. The ground truth answer is 2028.

3. The proposed answer is 2023 + 13*45 + 1 = 2023 + 585 + 1 = 2609.

Analysis:
- The quadratic equation x² - 13x - n = 0 must have integer solutions.
- For integer solutions, the discriminant D = 13² + 4n must be a perfect square.
- The smallest n > 2023 satisfying this is indeed 2028 (which makes D = 169 + 8112 = 8281 = 91²).
- The proposed answer 2609 is much larger than the correct minimal solution 2028.

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect.
