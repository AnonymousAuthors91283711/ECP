  (∑ k in Finset.Icc 0 100, (Int.floor ((2 ^ 100 : ℝ) / (2 ^ 50 + 2 ^ k))) = omnimath892_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern of the sum, the key observation is that when k ≤ 49, 2^k is negligible compared to 2^50, making the floor value 2^(50). For k ≥ 51, 2^k dominates, making the floor value 0. At k=50, the term becomes floor(2^100/(2*2^50)) = 2^49. 

<<<2^50 * 51 + 2^49>>>
