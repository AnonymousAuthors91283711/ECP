Ground Truth Answer: -1 / 2
Proposed Answer: 3 / 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a property P(x,y) as (y + x) = (y - x)² + 3(y - x) + 3)
2. We need to find the least y such that there exists an x making P(x,y) true
3. The ground truth answer is -1/2
4. The proposed answer is 3/4

Let's solve the equation to verify:
Let t = y - x, then the equation becomes:
y + x = t² + 3t + 3
But y = t + x, so substituting:
t + x + x = t² + 3t + 3 → 2x = t² + 2t + 3 → x = (t² + 2t + 3)/2

Now y = t + x = t + (t² + 2t + 3)/2 = (2t + t² + 2t + 3)/2 = (t² + 4t + 3)/2

To find the minimum y, we can minimize (t² + 4t + 3)/2. The minimum occurs at t = -b/(2a) = -4/2 = -2.

Substituting t = -2:
y = ((-2)² + 4(-2) + 3)/2 = (4 - 8 + 3)/2 = (-1)/2 = -1/2

The proposed answer 3/4 is incorrect as the correct minimum is indeed -1/2.
