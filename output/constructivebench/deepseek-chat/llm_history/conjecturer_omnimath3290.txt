abbrev omnimath3290_answer : Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath3290 : omnimath3290_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Prop
Based on the minimal information provided (just the problem name and expected type Prop), I'll make an educated guess that this is about a well-known mathematical proposition. A common simple Prop in math is Fermat's Last Theorem, which would fit the naming pattern.

<<<∀ (n : ℕ), n > 2 → ∀ (a b c : ℕ), a^n + b^n ≠ c^n>>>
