theorem P2001AIMEI_1 :
  ∑ k in (Finset.Icc 10 99).filter (fun k => ∀ d ∈ digits 10 k, d ≠ 0 ∧ k % d = 0), k = P2001AIMEI_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern of numbers between 10 and 99 where each digit divides the number (non-zero digits), the sum of all such numbers is:
<<<630>>>
