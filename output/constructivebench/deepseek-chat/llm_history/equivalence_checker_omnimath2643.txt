Ground Truth Answer: 64 / 3
Proposed Answer: 18
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have a rectangle with length l and width w
2. Given conditions:
   - l = 3w (hwl)
   - Perimeter condition: 2(l + w) = k (hperim)
   - Area condition: l * w = k (hare)
   - k > 0 (hk)

Let's solve it step by step:

From l = 3w:
Perimeter: 2(3w + w) = k ⇒ 8w = k ⇒ w = k/8
Area: 3w * w = k ⇒ 3w² = k

Substitute w = k/8 into area equation:
3(k/8)² = k ⇒ 3k²/64 = k ⇒ 3k² - 64k = 0 ⇒ k(3k - 64) = 0

Since k > 0, we have 3k - 64 = 0 ⇒ k = 64/3

The ground truth answer is correct (64/3), while the proposed answer (18) is incorrect.
