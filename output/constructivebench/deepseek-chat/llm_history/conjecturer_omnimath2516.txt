From the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we can deduce that we're looking for the probability (scaled by 10000) of finding a pair of competitors where one has higher general score but lower theme score than the other, or vice versa. The answer appears to be 5000, representing a 50% probability (since 10000 * 0.5 = 5000).
