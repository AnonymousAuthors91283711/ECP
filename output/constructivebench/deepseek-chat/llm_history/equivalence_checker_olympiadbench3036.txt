Ground Truth Answer: 4 / 17
Proposed Answer: 17^(-1 : ℝ) * 2^(2/5 : ℝ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. From the given equation hforth: a * r³ = 17, we can express a = 17/r³
2. From hprod: a⁵ * r^(0+1+2+3+4) = 32 => a⁵ * r¹⁰ = 32
3. Substitute a from step 1: (17/r³)⁵ * r¹⁰ = 32
4. Simplify: 17⁵ * r^(-15 + 10) = 32 => 17⁵ * r^(-5) = 32
5. Take fifth root: 17 * r^(-1) = 2^(5/5) => r^(-1) = 2/17
6. We need to find a*r: a*r = (17/r³)*r = 17/r²
7. From step 5: r = 17/2 => r² = (17/2)²
8. Thus a*r = 17/(17/2)² = 17*4/17² = 4/17

The ground truth answer is 4/17, which matches our derivation.

The proposed answer is 17⁻¹ * 2^(2/5). Let's evaluate this:
17⁻¹ * 2^(2/5) ≈ 0.0588 * 1.3195 ≈ 0.0776
But 4/17 ≈ 0.2353, so they're not equal.
