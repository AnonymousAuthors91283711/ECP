Looking at the pattern in the recurrence relation and coefficients (1, 2, 9, 8), we can conjecture this relates to the exponential generating function for a combination of exponential terms. The coefficients suggest roots at -1, -2, -4 (since 1×2×4=8 and 1+2+4=7, which relates to the recurrence). The generating function likely involves terms like e^x, e^(-x), e^(-2x), e^(-4x).

The errors occur because the exponential (`exp`) and cosine (`cos`) functions are not imported. We need to import `Real.exp` and `Real.cos` from Mathlib. The proposed answer looks correct based on the pattern of the recurrence relation and generating functions, which often involve exponential and trigonometric functions in such problems.

Here's the fixed answer with proper imports:

<<<(1/3) * (Real.exp 10 + 2 * Real.exp (-5) * Real.cos (5 * Real.sqrt 3))>>>

Explanation:
1. The recurrence relation suggests a solution involving exponential and trigonometric functions
2. The enumerated pattern matches the form of (e^10 + 2e^-5 cos(5√3))/3
3. We replace `exp` with `Real.exp` and `cos` with `Real.cos` to use Mathlib's real versions
4. The answer maintains the same mathematical structure while being properly typed in Lean

The form suggests roots of a characteristic polynomial with complex solutions, leading to the trigonometric component. The coefficients (1/3, 2, -5, 5√3) appear to balance the initial conditions given in the recurrence.
