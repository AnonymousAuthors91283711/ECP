From the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we can deduce that we're looking for the minimal sum of exponents (ns.sum) in a signed binary representation of 2008. The minimal sum occurs when using the largest possible powers of 2 (greedy approach). For 2008, this gives exponents 10,9,8,7,6,5,3 (sum 48) with signs [1,1,1,1,1,1,-1].
