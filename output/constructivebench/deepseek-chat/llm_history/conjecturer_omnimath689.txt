Looking at the equation 12a + 21b + 28c + 84d = 2024, we can factor the coefficients to find constraints:
- 12 = 12
- 21 = 3*7
- 28 = 4*7
- 84 = 12*7

The equation simplifies to 12a + 7(3b + 4c + 12d) = 2024. Since 2024 mod 7 = 1, we need 12a ≡ 1 mod 7 ⇒ a ≡ 3 mod 7. Let a = 7k + 3. Substituting gives 84k + 36 + 7(3b + 4c + 12d) = 2024 ⇒ 12k + (3b + 4c + 12d) = 284. The number of solutions grows linearly with k, but is constrained by positivity.
