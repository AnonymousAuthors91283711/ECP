Ground Truth Answer: -10
Proposed Answer: (-5)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have three equations:
   - a + 5 = b (hab)
   - 5 + b = c (hbc)
   - b + c = a (hac)

2. Let's solve the system:
   - From hab: a = b - 5
   - From hbc: c = b + 5
   - Substitute a and c into hac: b + (b + 5) = (b - 5)
   - Simplify: 2b + 5 = b - 5
   - Subtract b from both sides: b + 5 = -5
   - Subtract 5 from both sides: b = -10

The ground truth answer is indeed -10, while the proposed answer is -5. These are clearly different values.
