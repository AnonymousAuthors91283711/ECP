Looking at the problem, we need to find the sum of the infinite series where each term is (1/2)^(2n-1) for n starting from 1. The error in the current proposal is due to incorrect syntax for the infinite sum.

The series can be rewritten as:
∑ (1/2)^(2n-1) = (1/2) ∑ (1/4)^(n-1) = (1/2) / (1 - 1/4) = (1/2)/(3/4) = 2/3

Here's the corrected answer in Lean:

<<<2 / 3>>>

Explanation:
1. The series is geometric with first term (1/2)^1 = 1/2 when n=1
2. The common ratio is (1/2)^2 = 1/4
3. Sum of infinite geometric series is a/(1-r) = (1/2)/(1-1/4) = 2/3
4. The error in original was missing parentheses and incorrect sum notation[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem, we need to find the sum of the infinite series where each term is (1/2)^(2n-1) for n starting from 1. The error in the Lean code appears to be a syntax issue with the series notation.

The series can be rewritten as:
∑ (1/2)^(2n-1) = (1/2) ∑ (1/4)^(n-1) = (1/2) / (1 - 1/4) = (1/2)/(3/4) = 2/3

This is a geometric series with first term (1/2)^1 = 1/2 and common ratio (1/2)^2 = 1/4.
