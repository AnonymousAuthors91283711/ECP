Ground Truth Answer: 3 / 11
Proposed Answer: 1/5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting the number of solutions to two systems of equations and finding the ratio between them.

2. For set S (first equation): We need to count non-negative integer solutions to 2*q0 + q1 + q2 + q3 = 4. This is a stars and bars problem with modified coefficients.

3. For set T (both equations): We need solutions that satisfy both:
   - 2*q0 + q1 + q2 + q3 = 4
   - q0 + q1 + q2 + q3 = 3

4. By subtracting the second equation from the first, we get q0 = 1. Then the second equation becomes q1 + q2 + q3 = 2, which has C(2+3-1, 2) = 6 solutions.

5. For S: The number of solutions to 2*q0 + q1 + q2 + q3 = 4:
   - Case q0=0: q1+q2+q3=4 → C(4+3-1,4)=15
   - Case q0=1: q1+q2+q3=2 → 6 (as above)
   - Case q0=2: q1+q2+q3=0 → 1
   Total solutions for S: 15 + 6 + 1 = 22

6. The ratio is |T|/|S| = 6/22 = 3/11

The ground truth answer (3/11) is correct, while the proposed answer (1/5) is incorrect.
