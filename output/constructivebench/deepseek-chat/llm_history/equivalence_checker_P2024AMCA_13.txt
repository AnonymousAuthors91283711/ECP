Ground Truth Answer: (0, 1 / 2)
Proposed Answer: (1/2, 1/2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find a value 'a' such that the function f(x) = e^(x+1) + e^(-x) - 2 is symmetric about x = a. This means we need to find 'a' where f(x) = f(2a - x) for all x.

2. The ground truth answer is (0, 1/2), meaning a = 0 and f(-1) = 1/2.

3. The proposed answer is (1/2, 1/2), meaning a = 1/2 and f(-1) = 1/2.

Verification:
- For symmetry about x = 0: f(x) = e^(x+1) + e^(-x) - 2, f(-x) = e^(-x+1) + e^x - 2. These are not equal, so a=0 is incorrect.
- For symmetry about x=1/2: f(1/2 + t) = e^(3/2 + t) + e^(-1/2 - t) - 2, f(1/2 - t) = e^(3/2 - t) + e^(-1/2 + t) - 2. These are equal, so a=1/2 is correct.
- Both answers agree on f(-1) = 1/2.

The ground truth answer is incorrect about the symmetry point (should be 1/2 not 0), while the proposed answer is correct.
