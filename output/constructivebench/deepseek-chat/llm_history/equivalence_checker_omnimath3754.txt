Ground Truth Answer: {(5, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1), (4, 2), (15, 5)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for pairs (n,p) where:
   - n > 0 and p > 0
   - p is prime
   - Sum of first n natural numbers equals 3 times sum of squares of first p natural numbers

2. The ground truth answer is {(5,2)}. Let's verify:
   - Sum of first 5 naturals: 1+2+3+4+5 = 15
   - Sum of squares of first 2 naturals: 1² + 2² = 5
   - 3*5 = 15 ✔
   - p=2 is prime ✔

3. Proposed answer {(1,1), (4,2), (15,5)}:
   - (1,1): 
     - Sum: 1
     - 3*(1²) = 3 ≠ 1 ✖
   - (4,2):
     - Sum: 1+2+3+4 = 10
     - 3*(1²+2²) = 15 ≠ 10 ✖
   - (15,5):
     - Sum: 120
     - 3*(1+4+9+16+25) = 165 ≠ 120 ✖

4. Only (5,2) satisfies the condition, none of the proposed pairs do.
