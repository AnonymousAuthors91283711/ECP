Ground Truth Answer: 315
Proposed Answer: 3 * 5 * 7 * 3
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is \(3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 3 = 315\), which matches the ground truth answer of 315. The problem asks for the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers 3, 5, 7, and 9. Since 9 is \(3^2\), the LCM is calculated as \(3^2 \times 5 \times 7 = 315\). The proposed answer correctly computes this.
