From the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we can observe that the equation √(a² + b²) = a + b holds when either a or b is zero (but not both), or when both are non-negative. The key insight is that squaring both sides gives a² + b² = a² + 2ab + b², which simplifies to ab = 0. This suggests that the condition is that at least one of a or b must be zero.
