Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | (n = 1) ∨ (Nat.Prime n)}
Proposed Answer: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for all natural numbers n > 0 where there exists a unique integer a satisfying:
   - 0 ≤ a < n!
   - n! divides (a^n + 1)

2. The ground truth answer claims this set is exactly all prime numbers plus 1.

3. The proposed answer gives specific numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}.

Testing the cases:
- n=1: a=0 works (0^1 + 1 = 1 is divisible by 1!)
- n=2: a=1 works (1^2 + 1 = 2 is divisible by 2!)
- n=3: a=2 works (2^3 + 1 = 9 is divisible by 3! = 6)
- n=4: a=3 works (3^4 + 1 = 82 is not divisible by 24) - Wait, this seems incorrect
- n=5 (prime): a=4 works (4^5 + 1 = 1025 is divisible by 120)
- n=6: a=5 works (5^6 + 1 = 15626 is not divisible by 720)

The proposed answer includes 4 and 6 which don't seem to work, and excludes 5 which does work. The ground truth answer correctly identifies that primes and 1 work, while composites generally don't (with some exceptions that need verification).
