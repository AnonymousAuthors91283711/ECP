Ground Truth Answer: fun (a, b, c) => 37
Proposed Answer: fun ⟨a, b, c⟩ => a + b + c - min (min a b) c - 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes an iterative process where we repeatedly transform a tuple (x,y,z) based on which value is largest, subtracting combinations of the other values until one reaches zero.

2. The ground truth answer is a constant function that always returns 37 for the given inputs (15,14,13).

3. The proposed answer is a general formula: a + b + c - min(min a b) c - 1

For the specific case (15,14,13):
- min(min 15 14) 13 = 13
- 15 + 14 + 13 - 13 - 1 = 28
This doesn't match the ground truth (37).

The proposed answer fails for the given case, and there's no reason to believe it would work for other cases either. The formula appears to be incorrect.
