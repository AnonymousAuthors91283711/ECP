theorem omnimath2256 :
  let n := 21
  let alice := 11

Ground Truth Answer: 47/42
Proposed Answer: (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8 + 1/9 + 1/10) + (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8 + 1/9 + 1/10)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating expected games where:
   - n = 21 (total players)
   - alice = 11 (Alice's position)
   - The formula sums harmonic series from 1 to (alice-1) and from 1 to (n-alice)

2. Calculating the sums:
   - First sum (k from 0 to 10): 1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/10
   - Second sum (k from 0 to 10): same as first sum since n-alice=10
   - Total would be 2*(1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/10)

3. Ground truth is 47/42 ≈ 1.119
   - But 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 ≈ 2.45 already exceeds this
   - The proposed answer shows two full harmonic sums up to 1/10

4. The proposed answer is clearly much larger than the ground truth, and the structure doesn't match (should be sums up to different limits).
