(S : Fin 10 → ℕ)
(hSpos : ∀ i : Fin 10, S i > 0)
(hSgcd : ∀ i : Fin 10, S i = 1 + GCDMonoid.gcd (S ((i + 9) % 10)) (S ((i + 1) % 10)))
: (∑ i : Fin 10, S i = omnimath1352_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern from enumeration and the recursive gcd relationship, the sequence appears to be constant. The minimal solution satisfying all conditions is when all S i = 1. The sum of 10 terms would then be:

<<<10>>>
