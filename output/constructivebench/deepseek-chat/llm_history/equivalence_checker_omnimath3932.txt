Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 1, 1)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1, 1)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all positive integer triples (x,y,z) that satisfy:
   - x² = 2(y + z)
   - x⁶ = y⁶ + z⁶ + 31(y² + z²)

2. Ground truth answer is {(2,1,1)}. Let's verify:
   - For (2,1,1):
     - 2² = 4 = 2(1+1) ✓
     - 2⁶ = 64 = 1⁶ + 1⁶ + 31(1² + 1²) = 1 + 1 + 31(2) = 64 ✓

3. Proposed answer is {(1,1,1)}. Let's verify:
   - For (1,1,1):
     - 1² = 1 ≠ 2(1+1) = 4 ✗ (fails first condition)
     - Even if we check second condition: 1⁶ = 1 ≠ 1 + 1 + 31(2) = 64 ✗

The proposed answer fails both conditions, while the ground truth answer satisfies both. They are not equivalent.
