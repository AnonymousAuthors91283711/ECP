Ground Truth Answer: 77
Proposed Answer: 50
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a natural number k > 0 that satisfies the equation:
   k(k+1)(k+2) = 8(k + (k+1) + (k+2))

2. Simplifying the right side: 8(k + (k+1) + (k+2)) = 8(3k + 3) = 24(k + 1)

3. So the equation becomes: k(k+1)(k+2) = 24(k+1)

4. Since k+1 > 0, we can divide both sides by (k+1):
   k(k+2) = 24 → k² + 2k - 24 = 0

5. Solving the quadratic equation: k = [-2 ± √(4 + 96)]/2 = [-2 ± 10]/2
   The positive solution is k = 4

6. Now calculate k² + (k+1)² + (k+2)² for k=4:
   16 + 25 + 36 = 77

The ground truth answer is 77, while the proposed answer is 50. These are clearly different numbers.
