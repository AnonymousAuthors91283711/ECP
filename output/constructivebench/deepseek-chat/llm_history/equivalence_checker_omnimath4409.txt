abbrev omnimath4409_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath4409
: {x : ℝ | 3 * x ^ 3 - ⌊x⌋ = 3} = omnimath4409_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {Real.sqrt (4 / 3) ^ (1 / 3)}
Proposed Answer: {x : ℝ | x = (4/3)^(1/3) ∨ x = (5/3)^(1/3) ∨ x = (7/3)^(1/3)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all real x satisfying 3x³ - floor(x) = 3
2. Ground truth gives a single solution: cube root of (4/3)^(1/3), which simplifies to (4/3)^(1/3)
3. Proposed answer gives three possible solutions: (4/3)^(1/3), (5/3)^(1/3), and (7/3)^(1/3)

Analysis:
- For x in [1,2), floor(x)=1, equation becomes 3x³=4 → x=(4/3)^(1/3) ≈ 1.1006 (valid since 1 ≤ x < 2)
- For x in [2,3), floor(x)=2, equation becomes 3x³=5 → x=(5/3)^(1/3) ≈ 1.1856 (invalid since 2 ≤ x < 3)
- For x in [0,1), floor(x)=0, equation becomes 3x³=3 → x=1 (invalid since 0 ≤ x < 1)
- Negative cases don't work as floor(x) would be ≤-1, making left side negative while right side is positive

Only (4/3)^(1/3) is valid. The other two proposed solutions don't satisfy the original equation when considering their floor values.
