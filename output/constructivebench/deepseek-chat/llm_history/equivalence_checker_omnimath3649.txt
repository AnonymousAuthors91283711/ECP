Ground Truth Answer: Set.Icc 0 4
Proposed Answer: { r | 0 ≤ r ∧ r ≤ 4 }
<<<True>>>

Explanation: 
The ground truth answer `Set.Icc 0 4` is the standard notation in Lean/Mathlib for the closed interval from 0 to 4, which is exactly the set of real numbers `r` such that `0 ≤ r ∧ r ≤ 4`. The proposed answer `{ r | 0 ≤ r ∧ r ≤ 4 }` is just a different syntactic way of writing the same set. Both expressions represent the interval [0,4] on the real numbers. Therefore, the answers are equivalent.
