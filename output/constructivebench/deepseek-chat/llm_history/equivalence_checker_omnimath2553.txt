Ground Truth Answer: 864
Proposed Answer: 8 * 8 + 8 * choose 8 2 + 4 * (7 * 7 + 6 * 6 + 5 * 5 + 4 * 4 + 3 * 3 + 2 * 2 + 1 * 1)
Let me analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem is counting the number of 3-element subsets of an 8×8 grid (Fin 8 × Fin 8) where any two distinct points are either:
   - In the same row, or
   - In the same column, or
   - On the same diagonal (as indicated by the absolute difference condition)

2. The proposed answer breaks this down as:
   - 8*8: This part doesn't make sense for 3-element subsets
   - 8*choose(8,2): This would count row-aligned or column-aligned triples
   - The last term seems to attempt counting diagonal-aligned triples, but the coefficients and structure don't match the correct counting

3. The ground truth answer is 864, which is known to be correct for this problem.

4. The proposed answer evaluates to:
   8*8 = 64
   8*choose(8,2) = 8*28 = 224
   The last term evaluates to 4*(49+36+25+16+9+4+1) = 4*140 = 560
   Total = 64 + 224 + 560 = 848 ≠ 864

The proposed answer is close in approach but incorrect in both structure and final value.
