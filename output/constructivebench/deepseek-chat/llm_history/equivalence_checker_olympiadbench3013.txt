Ground Truth Answer: 66/7
Proposed Answer: (log 2 + 2 * log 3) / log 2
Let's analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

1. The ground truth answer is a simple fraction: 66/7 ≈ 9.42857

2. The proposed answer is (log 2 + 2 * log 3)/log 2. We can simplify this:
   (log 2 + 2 * log 3)/log 2 = 1 + 2*(log 3/log 2) = 1 + 2*log₂3 ≈ 1 + 2*1.58496 ≈ 4.16992

3. The numerical values are clearly different (9.42857 vs 4.16992), so the answers are not equivalent.
