theorem olympiadbench2391 (n : ℕ) :
    n^2 - 10 * n + 70 = 5 + 10 * (n - 1) ↔ n ∈ olympiadbench2391_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {5, 15}
Proposed Answer: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for natural numbers n where n² - 10n + 70 = 5 + 10(n - 1)
2. Let's simplify the equation:
   n² - 10n + 70 = 5 + 10n - 10
   n² - 10n + 70 = 10n - 5
   n² - 20n + 75 = 0
3. Solving the quadratic equation:
   n = [20 ± √(400 - 300)]/2
   n = [20 ± 10]/2
   Solutions: n = 15 or n = 5

The ground truth answer {5, 15} correctly identifies these solutions. The proposed answer {1, 2, ..., 10} is completely incorrect as it includes many numbers that don't satisfy the equation and misses the actual solutions (except for 5).
