Ground Truth Answer: 7560
Proposed Answer: 252 * (2^4 - 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem is counting subsets (committees) of size 5 from 10 elements where there exists a non-empty subset of leaders (size between 1 and 4).

2. The ground truth answer is 7560.

3. The proposed answer is 252 * (2^4 - 2):
   - 252 is C(10,5), the total number of 5-element subsets
   - (2^4 - 2) = 14 counts the number of non-empty proper subsets of a 4-element set
   - However, this doesn't correctly account for the constraint that leaders must be a subset of each committee

The correct calculation should be:
- For each committee of size 5, there are (2^5 - 2) = 30 possible non-empty proper subsets (leaders)
- But we need leaders of size 1-4, so we subtract the size-5 case: 30 - 1 = 29
- Then total would be C(10,5)*29 = 252*29 = 7308, which is still wrong

The actual correct count is:
- Total committees: C(10,5) = 252
- For each committee, number of valid leader subsets: Σ[C(5,k) for k=1..4] = 5 + 10 + 10 + 5 = 30
- Total: 252 * 30 = 7560

The proposed answer of 252 * 14 = 3528 is incorrect.
