abbrev omnimath1300_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1300 :
  ((List.range 233).filter (fun n => n > 0 ∧ Even n ∧ ¬(10 ∣ n))).sum = omnimath1300_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 10812
Proposed Answer: 2288
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 232 (since List.range 233 gives [0,1,...,232]) that:
   - Are greater than 0 (n > 0)
   - Are even (Even n)
   - Are not divisible by 10 (¬(10 ∣ n))

2. Calculation approach:
   - Total even numbers from 2 to 232: 232/2 = 116 numbers
   - Sum of all even numbers from 2 to 232: 2*(1+2+...+116) = 2*116*117/2 = 116*117 = 13572
   - Numbers divisible by 10 in this range: 10,20,...,230 → 23 numbers
   - Sum of numbers divisible by 10: 10*(1+2+...+23) = 10*23*24/2 = 2760
   - Final sum = 13572 - 2760 = 10812

3. The ground truth answer is 10812, which matches our calculation.
4. The proposed answer is 2288, which is incorrect.

The proposed answer is significantly different from the correct sum and doesn't match our verification.
