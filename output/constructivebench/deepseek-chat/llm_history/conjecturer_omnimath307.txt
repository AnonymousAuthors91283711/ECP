From the problem statement and the pattern of polynomial divisibility, the condition likely holds when n divides m+1. The enumerated answers support this pattern (e.g., (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) where n divides m+1).

Looking at the problem statement, we need to find a condition on (m,n) that makes the polynomial divisibility hold. The key observation is that the left sum is a geometric series in X^n, while the right has a factor that's a geometric series in X.

The divisibility condition should relate to when X^n - 1 divides X^{m+1} - 1, which happens exactly when n divides m+1. The error in the original answer was just a syntax issue with the type ascription.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<fun (m n : ℕ) => n ∣ (m + 1)>>>

Explanation:
1. The polynomial ∑ X^{n*k} can be written as (X^{n(m+1)} - 1)/(X^n - 1) when X^n ≠ 1
2. The polynomial ∑ X^k is (X^{m+1} - 1)/(X - 1)
3. For the divisibility to hold, (X^n - 1) must divide (X^{m+1} - 1)
4. This polynomial divisibility occurs exactly when n divides m+1
5. The syntax is fixed by removing the type ascription and making it a proper function of two arguments[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error occurs because the function signature expects a pair of natural numbers (ℕ × ℕ) as input, but the proposed answer takes two separate natural numbers. We need to adjust the lambda expression to take a pair instead.

Looking at the problem statement, we're trying to find when a polynomial divisibility condition holds. The left side shows a sum of X^(n*k) being divisible by a sum of X^k. This is similar to the geometric series formula, where divisibility occurs when n divides m+1 (since the roots of unity would align).

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<fun (p : ℕ × ℕ) => p.2 ∣ (p.1 + 1)>>>

Explanation:
1. The function now takes a pair p : ℕ × ℕ instead of separate arguments
2. p.1 refers to the first element (m) and p.2 refers to the second (n)
3. The condition remains n divides (m + 1), which matches the polynomial divisibility condition
4. This aligns with the geometric series property where X^m+1 - 1 factors when n divides m+1
