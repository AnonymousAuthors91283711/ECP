Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 5, 5), (4, 5, 1), (6, 4, 9)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b, c) | (a + b + c) % 9 = 0 ∧ (a - b + c) % 11 = 0 ∧ (a + 3*b + 2*c) % 8 = 0}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves finding all triples (A,B,C) where 0 ≤ A,B,C ≤ 9 such that N is divisible by 792 (since N % 792 = 0).

2. Note that 792 = 8 × 9 × 11, so we need N divisible by 8, 9, and 11.

3. The ground truth provides specific solutions: (0,5,5), (4,5,1), (6,4,9).

4. The proposed answer gives conditions modulo 9, 11, and 8 that must be satisfied.

Now let's check if the proposed conditions match the ground truth:

For (0,5,5):
- (0+5+5)%9 = 10%9 = 1 ≠ 0 → Fails first condition
But according to ground truth, this should be valid.

For (4,5,1):
- (4+5+1)%9 = 10%9 = 1 ≠ 0 → Fails first condition
But ground truth says it's valid.

For (6,4,9):
- (6+4+9)%9 = 19%9 = 1 ≠ 0 → Fails first condition
But ground truth says it's valid.

The proposed answer's conditions don't match the ground truth solutions. The first condition (sum mod 9) already fails for all ground truth solutions.

<<<False>>>
