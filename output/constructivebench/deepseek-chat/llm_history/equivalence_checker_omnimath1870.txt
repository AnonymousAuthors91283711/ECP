Ground Truth Answer: fun x y z => Real.sqrt 3
Proposed Answer: fun x y z => (3 : ℝ) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves logarithmic identities and exponents with variables x, y, z > 1.
2. The ground truth answer suggests that log y / log x = √3.
3. The proposed answer suggests log y / log x = 3/2.

These are clearly different values since √3 ≈ 1.732 and 3/2 = 1.5. The answers cannot be equivalent as they give different numerical results.

The correct answer can be derived by:
1. Taking logs of all three given equations
2. Setting a = log x, b = log y, c = log z
3. Solving the resulting system of equations
4. Finding that b/a = √3 is the solution

Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect.
