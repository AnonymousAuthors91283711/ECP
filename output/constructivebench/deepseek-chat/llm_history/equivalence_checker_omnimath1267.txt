abbrev omnimath1267_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1267
: (Real.arctan (Real.tan (65 * π / 180) - 2 * Real.tan (40 * π / 180)) * 180 / π = omnimath1267_answer) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 25
Proposed Answer: 5
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves trigonometric calculations with angles in degrees (converted to radians via π/180 factors).

2. The expression calculates:
   - tan(65°) - 2*tan(40°)
   - takes the arctan of that result
   - converts back to degrees (via *180/π)

3. Calculating numerically:
   - tan(65°) ≈ 2.1445
   - tan(40°) ≈ 0.8391
   - Expression becomes: 2.1445 - 2*0.8391 ≈ 0.4663
   - arctan(0.4663) ≈ 25° (ground truth)
   - The proposed answer is 5°, which is incorrect

The ground truth answer (25) matches the numerical calculation, while the proposed answer (5) does not.

<<<False>>>
