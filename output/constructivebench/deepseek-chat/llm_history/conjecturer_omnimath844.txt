theorem omnimath844 : 
  (∑ k in Finset.range 2001, (-1 : ℤ)^(k + 1) * (k + 1) * (k + 2)) = omnimath844_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern of the sum for smaller ranges:
- For n=1: sum is 2
- For n=2: sum is -4
- For n=3: sum is 6
- For n=4: sum is -8
The pattern suggests the answer alternates between positive and negative with magnitude 2n. Since 2001 is odd, the answer should be positive 2002.
