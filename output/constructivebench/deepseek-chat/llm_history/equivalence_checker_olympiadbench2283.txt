Ground Truth Answer: (-7, -1)
Proposed Answer: (1, -5)
Let me analyze this problem carefully.

The problem defines a function P that transforms a pair (x,y) to (-x, -(y-2)). We're asked to find the initial point S₀ such that applying P six times (P^[6]) results in (-7,-1).

Let's compute the iterations:
1. P(x,y) = (-x, -(y-2))
2. P^2(x,y) = (x, -(-(y-2)-2)) = (x, y-4)
3. P^3(x,y) = (-x, -(y-4-2)) = (-x, -y+6)
4. P^4(x,y) = (x, -(-y+6-2)) = (x, y-8)
5. P^5(x,y) = (-x, -(y-8-2)) = (-x, -y+10)
6. P^6(x,y) = (x, -(-y+10-2)) = (x, y-12)

We want P^6(S₀) = (-7,-1), which means:
(x, y-12) = (-7,-1)
Therefore:
x = -7
y-12 = -1 ⇒ y = 11

So the correct initial point should be (-7,11), not (1,-5) as proposed.
