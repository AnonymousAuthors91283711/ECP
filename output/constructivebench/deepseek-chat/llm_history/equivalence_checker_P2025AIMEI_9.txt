Ground Truth Answer: (3 - sqrt 57) / 2
Proposed Answer: (-4 * Real.sqrt 3) / 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a unique pair (p₁, p₂) where:
   - p₂ = p₁² - 4
   - After rotating the point (p₁, p₂) by π/3 (60 degrees), the new y-coordinate equals the new x-coordinate squared minus 4
   - With constraints p₁ > 0 and p₂ < 0

2. The ground truth answer gives p₂ = (3 - √57)/2 ≈ -2.275, which satisfies p₂ < 0

3. The proposed answer gives p₂ = (-4√3)/3 ≈ -2.309, which also satisfies p₂ < 0

However, let's check if the proposed answer satisfies the other conditions:
- For p₂ = (-4√3)/3, p₁ would be √(p₂ + 4) = √(4 - 4√3/3) ≈ √(1.6906) ≈ 1.3 (positive)
- But when we plug these values into the rotation equations and the transformed parabola condition, they don't satisfy all the constraints exactly

The ground truth answer comes from solving the system of equations properly, while the proposed answer doesn't fully satisfy all conditions.
