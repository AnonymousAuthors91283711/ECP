Ground Truth Answer: -63
Proposed Answer: 105
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for three distinct integers (a, b, c) that form an arithmetic sequence (since b-a = c-b), whose product is 17955, and satisfy certain ratio conditions.

2. The ground truth answer is -63, which would be the sum of such integers.

3. The proposed answer is 105, which is positive and significantly different in magnitude from -63.

4. For three numbers in arithmetic progression, their sum is 3 times the middle term (a + b + c = 3b). Therefore, if the sum is -63, the middle term would be -21, while if the sum were 105, the middle term would be 35.

5. Checking the product condition with b=-21: The numbers would be -21-d, -21, -21+d. Their product is (-21-d)(-21)(-21+d) = -21(441-d²) = 17955 ⇒ 441-d² = -855 ⇒ d² = 1296 ⇒ d=±36. This gives valid solutions (-57, -21, 15) and (15, -21, -57).

6. Checking with b=35: The product would be -35(1225-d²) = 17955 ⇒ 1225-d² ≈ -513 ⇒ d² ≈ 1738 ⇒ d≈±41.68, which doesn't yield integer solutions.

The proposed answer (105) doesn't satisfy the conditions of the problem, while the ground truth (-63) does.
