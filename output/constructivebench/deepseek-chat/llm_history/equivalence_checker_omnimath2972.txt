  (x : ℝ) 
  (hx : 4 * x + 20 + 140 = 360)

Ground Truth Answer: 2/3
Proposed Answer: 1 / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. First, let's solve the equation from the hypothesis hx:
   4x + 20 + 140 = 360
   => 4x + 160 = 360
   => 4x = 200
   => x = 50

2. Now plug x=50 into the expression (4*x)/360:
   (4*50)/360 = 200/360 = 5/9 ≈ 0.555...

3. Compare with given answers:
   - Ground truth: 2/3 ≈ 0.666...
   - Proposed: 1/2 = 0.5

4. Neither answer matches the correct calculation of 5/9. The proposed answer (1/2) is closer to the correct value than the ground truth (2/3), but both are incorrect.

<<<False>>>
