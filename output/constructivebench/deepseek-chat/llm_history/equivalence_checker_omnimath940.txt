Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 2002
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence a(n) where:
   - a(1) = 1
   - For n > 1, a(n) = gcd(a(n-1), n) + 1

2. The ground truth answer claims a(2002) = 3
3. The proposed answer claims a(2002) = 2002

Let's compute some initial values to see the pattern:
- a(1) = 1
- a(2) = gcd(1,2) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
- a(3) = gcd(2,3) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
- a(4) = gcd(2,4) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3
- a(5) = gcd(3,5) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
- a(6) = gcd(2,6) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3
- a(7) = gcd(3,7) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
- a(8) = gcd(2,8) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3
...

We can observe that the sequence oscillates between 2 and 3 for n ≥ 2. The value 2002 never appears in the sequence, and by n=2002, the value will be either 2 or 3 (in fact, it's 3).

The proposed answer of 2002 is completely incorrect based on the sequence's behavior.
