Ground Truth Answer: (fun n => n^2 + n + 1)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 2 * n * n
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal number k such that for any grid of size 2n×2n with exactly k true entries, there exists a set of operations that covers all true entries.

2. The ground truth answer suggests the formula n² + n + 1.

3. The proposed answer suggests the formula 2n².

Comparison:
- For n=1:
  - Ground truth: 1² + 1 + 1 = 3
  - Proposed: 2*1*1 = 2
  - 2 ≠ 3, so they differ at n=1
- For n=2:
  - Ground truth: 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
  - Proposed: 2*4 = 8
  - 7 ≠ 8
- The formulas clearly give different results for all n ≥ 1

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the ground truth for any positive n.
