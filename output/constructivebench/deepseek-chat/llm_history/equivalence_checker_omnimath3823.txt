Ground Truth Answer: {(5, 3)}
Proposed Answer: {(m, n) | m = n + 1}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding pairs (m,n) where m,n ≥ 3 such that there are infinitely many positive integers a satisfying the given equation.

2. The ground truth answer claims that only (5,3) satisfies this condition.

3. The proposed answer suggests that all pairs where m = n + 1 satisfy the condition.

Analysis:
- For (5,3), we can verify that a=2 gives 2^5 + 2 - 1 = 33 and 2^3 + 2^2 - 1 = 11, and indeed 33 = 3*11. There are indeed infinitely many solutions (like a=2^k).
- However, for other m=n+1 pairs like (4,3), testing a=2 gives 2^4 + 2 - 1 = 17 and 2^3 + 2^2 - 1 = 11, which don't satisfy the condition (17 is not divisible by 11).
- The proposed answer is too broad - only (5,3) seems to work, not all m=n+1 cases.
