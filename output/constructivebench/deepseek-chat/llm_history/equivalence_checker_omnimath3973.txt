Ground Truth Answer: 120
Proposed Answer: 1998 * 2^2
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem is asking for the least value in the set {f(1998)} where f satisfies the functional equation:
f(n² * f(m)) = m * (f(n))² for all m,n ∈ ℕ

The ground truth answer is 120, while the proposed answer is 1998 * 2² = 7992.

To check equivalence:
1. The functional equation suggests f has multiplicative properties
2. The minimal solution would involve finding the minimal f(1998) that satisfies the equation
3. 120 is indeed much smaller than 7992
4. The proposed answer doesn't seem to satisfy the minimality condition

The proposed answer is incorrect as it's not the minimal solution, and the calculation doesn't match the ground truth.
