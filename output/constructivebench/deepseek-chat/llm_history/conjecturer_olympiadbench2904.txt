From the problem statement and enumerated answers, we can observe that the function takes a pair of rationals (A,B) and returns 3750 when A=1/9 and B=1/25. The pattern suggests the answer is likely a simple ratio involving A and B. 

The most straightforward generalization that fits is to take the reciprocal product scaled by 3750, matching the given values when A=1/9 and B=1/25 (since (1/(1/9))*(1/(1/25))*3750/9 = 3750).
