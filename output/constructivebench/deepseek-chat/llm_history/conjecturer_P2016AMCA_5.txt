theorem P2016AMCA_5 (n : ℕ) : 
  Even n ∧ n > 2 ∧ ¬∃ (p q : ℕ), p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ p + q = n ↔ n ∈ P2016AMCA_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{n | Even n ∧ n > 2 ∧ ∀ p < n, p.Prime → ¬ (n - p).Prime}>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks for even numbers >2 that cannot be expressed as sum of two primes (violating Goldbach's conjecture). The answer is the set of counterexamples to Goldbach's conjecture. The enumerated answers would be numbers like 4,6,8,... that meet these conditions.
