The error occurs because `Real.sqrt` is a noncomputable operation in Lean, so we need to mark the definition as `noncomputable`. The proposed answer `3 + 2 * Real.sqrt 2` appears correct based on symmetry considerations and the pattern seen in similar optimization problems with symmetric constraints. The minimal value likely occurs when two variables are equal and the third is different, leading to this expression involving √2.

Here's the fixed answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev omnimath3714_answer : ℝ := 3 + 2 * Real.sqrt 2>>>

The explanation is:
1. The constraint suggests symmetry between variables
2. The minimal case likely occurs when two variables are equal (say a = b)
3. Solving the equation under this symmetry leads to the √2 term
4. The constant 3 comes from the two equal variables contributing 1 each and the third variable contributing 1 + 2√2
5. The noncomputable annotation is required because Real.sqrt isn't computable in Lean's logic[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
