(hn : 2 * n + 5 = 16)
: 2 * n - 3 = omnimath3090_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us the equation: 2 * n + 5 = 16
2. Solving for n: 2n = 16 - 5 → 2n = 11 → n = 5.5
3. However, n is defined as a natural number (ℕ), so n = 5.5 is invalid
4. The problem is actually unsolvable within natural numbers since 11 is odd and can't be divided by 2 to give a natural number

The ground truth answer claims the result is 8, while the proposed answer claims it's 5. Neither is correct because:
- If we ignore the natural number constraint and use n=5.5: 2*5.5-3 = 8 (ground truth)
- The proposed answer 5 seems to come from using n=4 (2*4-3=5), but n=4 doesn't satisfy the original equation

Since neither answer is mathematically valid given the constraints, but the ground truth would be correct if we ignored the natural number constraint, while the proposed answer is completely wrong, the correct judgment is:

<<<False>>>
