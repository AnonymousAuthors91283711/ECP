Looking at the recurrence relation and initial condition, this appears to be a trigonometric sequence in disguise. The recurrence resembles the tangent addition formula. Let's analyze:

1. The recurrence is of the form aₙ₊₁ = (√3 aₙ + 1)/(√3 - aₙ)
2. This matches tan(x + π/6) = (tanx + tan(π/6))/(1 - tanx tan(π/6))
3. Given a₁ = 1 = tan(π/4), we can conjecture aₙ = tan(π/4 + (n-1)π/6)

The sum would then be ∑[n=1 to 2022] tan(π/4 + (n-1)π/6). However, tangent has period π, and π/6 is 1/6 of the period, so every 6 terms will cancel out due to symmetry. 

2022 is divisible by 6 (2022 = 6*337), so the sum should be 337 * (sum of 6 consecutive tangent terms), which is 0 due to cancellation. However, the initial proposed answer suggests a non-zero value, indicating a different pattern.

Given the error message, we need to mark the definition as noncomputable and provide a closed form. The correct answer appears to be a constant multiple of √3 based on the pattern.

<<<noncomputable abbrev mathodyssey52_answer : ℝ := 0>>> 

Explanation: The tangent terms cancel out in groups of 6 due to periodicity and symmetry, resulting in a zero sum. The initial proposed answer was incorrect as it didn't account for the full cancellation pattern. The correct sum is zero for any multiple of 6 terms.
