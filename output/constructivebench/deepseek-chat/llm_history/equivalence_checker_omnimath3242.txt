Ground Truth Answer: fun n => {1 / (n.factorial : ℝ), -1 / (n.factorial : ℝ)}
Proposed Answer: fun n => {0} ∪ {x | ∃ m : ℤ, 1 ≤ |m| ∧ |m| ≤ n ∧ x = -m}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the set of real numbers x where p.eval(1/x) = x², given certain conditions on polynomial p.

2. The ground truth answer suggests the solution set includes ±1/n! (factorial of n).

3. The proposed answer suggests the solution set includes 0 and negatives of integers m where 1 ≤ |m| ≤ n.

Key observations:
- The ground truth answer focuses on specific fractional values (±1/n!)
- The proposed answer includes 0 and negative integers
- Neither answer seems to capture the full solution set implied by the theorem statement
- Both answers are incomplete and don't match each other

The answers are not equivalent and both appear to be incorrect or incomplete based on the theorem statement. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth at all.
