From the problem, we can see it's about an arithmetic sequence of logarithms where the common difference d is consistent. The exponents in the log terms form a pattern: (3,7), (5,12), (8,15). The difference between exponents shows b's exponent increases by 5 each step. For k=12, b's exponent would be 7 + 5*(12-1) = 62.

<<<62>>>
