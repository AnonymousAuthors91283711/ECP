Based on the problem statement and error message, I notice the issue is with the syntax in the `let` bindings - they need to be separated by semicolons or line breaks. The mathematical content seems to be about counting configurations with certain independence properties, and the answer should be a reduced fraction (pair of coprime numbers).

Looking at the pattern and the given proposed answer (13,8), I conjecture this represents the reduced form of the fraction (4*2 + 4*2 + 2*2)^6 / (4*2)^6 = (8+8+4)^6/8^6 = 20^6/8^6 = (20/8)^6 = (5/2)^6 = 15625/64, but reduced to simplest form. However, 15625 and 64 are already coprime, so the proposed (13,8) seems incorrect.

The correct answer should be the reduced form of (colorChoices + patternChoices - 1)^n = (2+2-1)^6 = 3^6 = 729/1, but this doesn't match either. 

After re-examizing the formula, the correct fraction appears to be ((c*p*(c+p-1))^n)/((c*p)^n) = (c+p-1)^n = 3^6 = 729/1. But since the problem expects a pair, we should return (729, 1).

<<<(729, 1)>>>

Explanation: The independent configurations formula simplifies to (c+p-1)^n when divided by total configurations (c*p)^n, since (c*p*(c+p-1))^n/(c*p)^n = (c+p-1)^n. For c=p=2 and n=6, this becomes 3^6 = 729, with denominator 1. The pair (729,1) is already in simplest form.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the problem statement and error message, the issue appears to be with the syntax of multiple let bindings on the same line. The correct solution should be a pair of coprime natural numbers representing the simplified fraction of independent configurations to total configurations.

Looking at the mathematical expressions:
- Total configurations = (2*2)^6 = 4096
- Independent configurations = (2*2*(2+2-1))^6 = (4*3)^6 = 12^6 = 2985984
- Simplified fraction = 2985984/4096 = 729/1

The error in the proposed answer was just a syntax issue with multiple let bindings. The mathematical content (729, 1) is correct. Here's the fixed answer:

<<<(729, 1)>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem involves counting configurations with certain independence properties
2. The total configurations are (color choices × pattern choices)^n = (2×2)^6 = 4096
3. The independent configurations are (color × pattern × (color + pattern - 1))^n = (4×3)^6 = 2985984
4. The simplified fraction is 729/1 since 2985984/4096 = 729
