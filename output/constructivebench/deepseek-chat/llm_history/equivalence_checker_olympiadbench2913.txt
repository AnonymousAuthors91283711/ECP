Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem states we have digits A, B, C (each <10) forming two 2-digit numbers AB and AC.
2. The sum of their squares equals 1313.
3. We need to find A + B + C.

Let's find possible values:
- AB² + AC² = 1313
- Since AB and AC are 2-digit numbers (10-99), their squares range from 100 to 9801.
- Possible combinations where sum of squares is 1313:
  - 28² + 23² = 784 + 529 = 1313 → A=2, B=8, C=3 → sum=13
  - 23² + 28² = same as above
  - 32² + 17² = 1024 + 289 = 1313 → A=3, B=2, C=7 → sum=12
  - 17² + 32² = same as above

The ground truth answer (13) comes from the first solution (2,8,3). The proposed answer (8) doesn't match any valid solution.
