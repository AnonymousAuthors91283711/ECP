Ground Truth Answer: {(-1, -1), (8, -10), (9, -6), (9, -21)}
Proposed Answer: setOf (fun (p : ℤ × ℤ) => ∃ k, p = (k, -k) ∨ p = (k, 1 - k) ∨ p = (-k^2, k))
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all integer pairs (m,n) where m,n≠0 that satisfy the equation (m²+n)(m+n²) = (m-n)³.

2. The ground truth provides 4 specific solutions: (-1,-1), (8,-10), (9,-6), (9,-21).

3. The proposed answer gives a parametric solution with three cases:
   - (k, -k)
   - (k, 1-k)
   - (-k², k)

Let's test the ground truth solutions against the proposed answer:
- (-1,-1): matches (k,-k) with k=-1
- (8,-10): matches (k,1-k) with k=8 (1-8=-7≠-10) → doesn't match any case
- (9,-6): matches (k,1-k) with k=9 (1-9=-8≠-6) → doesn't match
- (9,-21): matches (k,1-k) with k=9 (1-9=-8≠-21) → doesn't match

Only one of the four ground truth solutions is captured by the proposed answer. The proposed answer misses most of the actual solutions and includes many potential pairs that aren't solutions (like all (k,1-k) pairs where 1-k≠-k²).
