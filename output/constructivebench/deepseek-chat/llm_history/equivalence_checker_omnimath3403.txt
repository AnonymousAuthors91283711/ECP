Ground Truth Answer: 10
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the product of the roots of the equation:
   (X-4)(X-2) + (X-2)(X-6) = 0

2. First, let's simplify the equation:
   (X-2)[(X-4) + (X-6)] = 0
   (X-2)(2X-10) = 0

3. The roots are clearly X=2 and X=5 (from 2X-10=0)

4. The product of the roots is 2 * 5 = 10

The ground truth answer is 10, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 4, which is incorrect.
