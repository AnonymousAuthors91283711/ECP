Ground Truth Answer: 2402
Proposed Answer: 2500
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n where √(n+99) - √n < 1.

2. To solve this, we can:
   - Square both sides: (√(n+99) - √n)² < 1²
   - Expand: n+99 - 2√(n(n+99)) + n < 1
   - Simplify: 2n + 98 < 2√(n(n+99))
   - Further simplify: n + 49 < √(n(n+99))
   - Square again: (n+49)² < n(n+99)
   - Expand: n² + 98n + 2401 < n² + 99n
   - Simplify: 2401 < n

3. Therefore, the smallest integer satisfying this is n = 2402.

4. The proposed answer is 2500, which is greater than 2402 but not the smallest such number.

The ground truth answer (2402) is correct, while the proposed answer (2500) is incorrect as it's not the minimal solution.
