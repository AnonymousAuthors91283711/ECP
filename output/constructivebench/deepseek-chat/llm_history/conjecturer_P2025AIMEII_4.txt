Looking at the pattern of the product ∏ (2^(2^k) + 1) for k=0 to 9, we notice this is similar to the known identity for Fermat numbers. The product of first n Fermat numbers equals the next Fermat number minus 2. Therefore, the product equals 2^(2^10) - 1 = 2^1024 - 1. Thus m = 2^1024 - 1 and n = 1, making m+n = 2^1024.

<<<2^1024>>>
