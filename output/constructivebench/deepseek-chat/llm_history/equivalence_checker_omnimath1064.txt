Ground Truth Answer: (3^59 + 1) / (4 * 3^59)
Proposed Answer: (1:ℚ)/4 + (1:ℚ)/(4 * 3^(60 - 1))
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground truth: (3^59 + 1)/(4 * 3^59)
Proposed: 1/4 + 1/(4 * 3^59)

Let's simplify the proposed answer:
1/4 + 1/(4 * 3^59) = (3^59 + 1)/(4 * 3^59)

This is exactly equal to the ground truth answer. The proposed answer is just the expanded form of the ground truth answer.
