Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ (c k : ℝ), (StrictMono f ∨ StrictAnti f) ∧ 
    (∀ x > 0, f x = c * log x) ∨ (∀ x > 0, f x = c * x ^ k)}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ (c : ℝ) (k : ℝ), (c ≠ 0 ∧ k ≠ 0) ∧ (∀ x, f x = c * x^k ∨ ∀ x, f x = c * (-x)^k)}
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer:

1. The ground truth answer correctly captures:
   - Strictly monotone functions (either increasing or decreasing)
   - Two possible forms: logarithmic (f(x) = c*log x) or power functions (f(x) = c*x^k)
   - Defined only for x > 0

2. The proposed answer has several issues:
   - It includes negative x values (-x)^k which aren't in the original problem
   - It requires both c ≠ 0 and k ≠ 0, which is too restrictive (logarithmic case would have k=0)
   - It misses the logarithmic case entirely
   - The condition x > 0 is not enforced
   - The "or" between the two forms is incorrectly placed inside the quantifier

The proposed answer is incorrect because it doesn't match the functional forms specified in the ground truth, adds unnecessary restrictions, and fails to maintain the domain constraint (x > 0).
