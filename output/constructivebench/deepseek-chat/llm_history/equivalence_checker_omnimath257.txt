Ground Truth Answer: {n | 3 ≤ n}
Proposed Answer: {n | ∃ p, Nat.Prime p ∧ p ∣ n}
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is about finding natural numbers n > 1 where there exists a non-zero integer sequence a_k such that a certain summation condition holds. The ground truth answer says this holds for all n ≥ 3, while the proposed answer says it holds for all composite numbers (numbers divisible by some prime).

The key observations:
1. The ground truth includes all numbers ≥3, both prime and composite
2. The proposed answer only includes composite numbers (since primes divide themselves)
3. The proposed answer excludes prime numbers ≥3, which are included in the ground truth

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent because:
- They disagree on prime numbers ≥3 (ground truth includes them, proposed answer excludes them)
- They agree on composite numbers ≥3
- They agree on n=2 (both exclude it)
