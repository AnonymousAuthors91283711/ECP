The error occurs because Lean expects line breaks or semicolons between `let` bindings. The proposed answer `9/2` is correct for the absolute difference between -3 and 3/2, but we need to fix the syntax first.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<9/2>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem involves calculating the absolute difference between two x-coordinates:
   - x1 = -3
   - x2 = 3/2
2. The calculation is: |x1 - x2| = |-3 - (3/2)| = |-9/2| = 9/2
3. The error was purely syntactic - Lean requires proper separation between `let` bindings
4. The mathematical content remains correct as 9/2 is indeed the absolute difference between these two points
5. The answer is already in the simplest form as a real number (ℝ)[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
