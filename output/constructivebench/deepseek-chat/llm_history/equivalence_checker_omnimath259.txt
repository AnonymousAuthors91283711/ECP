Ground Truth Answer: {P : Polynomial ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, P = c * (Polynomial.X ^ 2 + Polynomial.C 3)}
Proposed Answer: {P : Polynomial ℝ | ∃ a b : ℝ, P = Polynomial.C a * (Polynomial.X)^3 + Polynomial.C b * Polynomial.X}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for all real polynomials P that satisfy a certain functional equation involving x, y, z ≠ 0 with 2xyz = x+y+z.

2. The ground truth answer states that the solution set consists of all quadratic polynomials of the form c(X² + 3) for some constant c.

3. The proposed answer suggests that the solution set consists of all cubic polynomials of the form aX³ + bX.

Key observations:
- The ground truth answer is quadratic while the proposed answer is cubic
- The forms are fundamentally different (X²+3 vs X³+X)
- The functional equation suggests symmetry that matches the ground truth form better
- The proposed cubic form doesn't satisfy the given condition (we can test with simple cases)

Conclusion: The answers are not equivalent.
