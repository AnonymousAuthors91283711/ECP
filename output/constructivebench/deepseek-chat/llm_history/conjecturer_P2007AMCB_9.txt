Looking at the problem, we need to find f(5) given the functional equation f(3x-1) = x² + x + 1. 

To find f(5), we need to solve for x in 3x-1 = 5:
3x - 1 = 5 → x = 2

Then substitute x=2 into the right side of the equation:
f(5) = f(3*2-1) = 2² + 2 + 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7

The proposed answer 7/9 was incorrect - it should be 7. The error message about noncomputable was secondary to the incorrect answer.

Here's the corrected answer in Lean format:

<<<7>>>
