(S B : ℕ)
(hratio : S * 4 = B * 7)
(hmore : S = B + 12)
: S + B = omnimath2932_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 44
Proposed Answer: 112
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. We have two equations:
   - S * 4 = B * 7 (from hratio)
   - S = B + 12 (from hmore)

2. Let's solve the system:
   - Substitute S from second equation into first: (B + 12)*4 = B*7
   - Expand: 4B + 48 = 7B
   - Rearrange: 48 = 3B
   - Solve: B = 16

3. Then S = B + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28

4. Therefore S + B = 28 + 16 = 44

The ground truth answer is correct (44), while the proposed answer (112) is incorrect. The proposed answer appears to be simply multiplying S and B (28*4=112), which is not what the problem asks for.
