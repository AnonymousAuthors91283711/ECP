theorem olympiadbench2277 :
  let (r, q, p) := olympiadbench2277_answer
  q = 2 * r ∧ q = p - 4 ∧ (p + q + r) / 3 = 13 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ × ℕ
From the problem statement and enumerated answers, we can deduce:
1. The conditions form a system of equations
2. The average of p, q, r is 13 ⇒ sum is 39
3. q = 2r and q = p - 4
4. Solving gives r=7, q=14, p=18 (7+14+18=39)
