Ground Truth Answer: 1 / 1002
Proposed Answer: 2005 / 2004
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves finding three complex numbers z₁, z₂, z₃ that satisfy certain conditions involving their real and imaginary parts, and then evaluating a product expression involving these numbers.

2. The ground truth answer is 1/1002, while the proposed answer is 2005/2004.

3. The two answers are clearly different numerical values (1/1002 ≈ 0.000998 while 2005/2004 ≈ 1.000499).

4. There's no obvious transformation or simplification that would make these two expressions equivalent.

5. The proposed answer doesn't appear to be a partial or domain-restricted version of the ground truth answer - it's simply a different value.

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
