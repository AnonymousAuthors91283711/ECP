Ground Truth Answer: 315
Proposed Answer: 840
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest positive integer 'a' such that there exists a polynomial P with integer coefficients where:
   - P evaluates to 'a' at x=1,3,5,7
   - P evaluates to '-a' at x=2,4,6,8

2. The ground truth answer is 315, which is correct because:
   - The minimal such polynomial would have roots at x=2,4,6,8 (since P(x) = -a at these points)
   - We can construct P(x) = a - 2a * Q(x) where Q(x) is a polynomial that's 0 at x=1,3,5,7 and 1 at x=2,4,6,8
   - The minimal 'a' must be such that all coefficients remain integers, leading to a=315 as the least common multiple of the denominators

3. The proposed answer is 840, which is larger than 315. While 840 would work (as it's a multiple of 315), it's not the minimal solution.
