Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 10
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

The problem is asking for a natural number `total` that satisfies:
1. 0 < total
2. 2 * total is divisible by 5 (2 * total % 5 = 0)
3. (2 * total / 5 - 2) * 10 = 3 * (total - 2 + 2)
4. 2 * total / 5 equals some predefined answer

Let's test both proposed answers:

For ground truth answer 8:
1. 2*8 = 16, 16/5 = 3.2 → Not divisible by 5 (16%5=1≠0) → Doesn't satisfy condition 2
This suggests the ground truth answer might be incorrect.

For proposed answer 10:
1. 2*10 = 20, 20%5 = 0 → satisfies condition 2
2. (20/5 - 2)*10 = (4-2)*10 = 20
3. 3*(10-2+2) = 3*10 = 30 → 20 ≠ 30 → Doesn't satisfy condition 3

Neither answer satisfies all conditions. However, if we look for a number that satisfies all conditions:
Let's solve the equation (2*total/5 - 2)*10 = 3*total
This simplifies to 4*total - 20 = 3*total → total = 20

Testing total=20:
1. 0 < 20
2. 2*20=40, 40%5=0
3. (40/5-2)*10=(8-2)*10=60, 3*(20)=60
4. 2*20/5=8

This shows the correct answer should be 20, with P2007AMCB_10_answer=8.

Since neither the ground truth (8) nor proposed answer (10) is correct, they are not equivalent.
