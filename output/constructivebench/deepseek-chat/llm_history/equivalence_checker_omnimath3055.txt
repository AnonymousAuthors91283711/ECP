Ground Truth Answer: 12
Proposed Answer: 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. First, calculate the total: 4 + 5 + 7 = 16
2. The equation given is: 2 * (4/16) = 4/(16 - k)
3. Simplify: 2 * (1/4) = 4/(16 - k) => 1/2 = 4/(16 - k)
4. Cross multiply: 16 - k = 8 => k = 8

However, the ground truth answer is 12 and the proposed answer is 5, neither of which matches our calculation. 

The problem seems to be about finding a natural number k that satisfies the given equation. Based on the mathematical working, the correct answer should be 8. Both the ground truth (12) and proposed answer (5) are incorrect.
