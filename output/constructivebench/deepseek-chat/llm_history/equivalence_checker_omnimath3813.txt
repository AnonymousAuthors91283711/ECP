Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 3
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

The problem is asking for the smallest natural number b (≥2) such that there exists a range of b consecutive numbers where for every number k in the range, there's another distinct number l in the same range where gcd(k²+k+1, l²+l+1) ≠ 1.

The ground truth answer is 6, while the proposed answer is 3.

To evaluate:
1. For b=3, let's test a=1 (numbers 2,3,4):
   - For k=2, we'd need l=3 or 4 where gcd(7,13) or gcd(7,21)=7 works (l=4)
   - For k=3, we'd need l=2 or 4 where gcd(13,7)=1 or gcd(13,21)=1 fails
   - Thus b=3 doesn't satisfy the condition for all k in the range

2. For b=6, there exists a range (e.g., a=5: numbers 6-11) where the condition holds for all k in the range.

The proposed answer 3 is incorrect because it fails to satisfy the condition for all k in any range of 3 consecutive numbers. The smallest b that works is indeed 6.
