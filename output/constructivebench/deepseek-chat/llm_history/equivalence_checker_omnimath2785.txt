Ground Truth Answer: 78
Proposed Answer: 114 - 46656^(1/3)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem gives us a geometric sequence (b = a*r, c = a*r²) with three variables a, b, c.
2. We know a + b + c = 114 and a*b*c = 46656.
3. The ground truth answer is 78 for a + c.

The proposed answer suggests 114 - 46656^(1/3). Let's evaluate this:
- 46656^(1/3) = 36 (since 36³ = 46656)
- So 114 - 36 = 78

This matches exactly with the ground truth answer. The proposed answer is just a different way of expressing the same value.
