Ground Truth Answer: 418
Proposed Answer: (-3) * 10 - 17 * (-3) + (17 * 10)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding a polynomial P with specific properties and then determining the product of two special roots (n₁ * n₂).

2. The ground truth answer is 418, which is a specific integer value.

3. The proposed answer is an expression: (-3)*10 - 17*(-3) + (17*10). Let's evaluate this:
   (-3)*10 = -30
   -17*(-3) = 51
   17*10 = 170
   Sum: -30 + 51 + 170 = 191

The evaluated proposed answer (191) does not match the ground truth answer (418). The expressions are not equivalent, and the numerical values differ significantly.
