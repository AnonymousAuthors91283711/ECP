Ground Truth Answer: 26
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find integer solutions (x,y) to the system:
   - 2x² + 8y = 26
   - x - y = answer (with answer being either 26 or 4 in our case)

2. Let's test the ground truth answer (26):
   If x - y = 26, then y = x - 26
   Substitute into first equation: 2x² + 8(x-26) = 26
   Simplify: 2x² + 8x - 208 = 26 → 2x² + 8x - 234 = 0 → x² + 4x - 117 = 0
   Solutions: x = [-4 ± √(16+468)]/2 = [-4 ± √484]/2 = [-4 ± 22]/2 → x=9 or x=-13
   Both give integer solutions, so 26 is correct.

3. Now test proposed answer (4):
   If x - y = 4, then y = x - 4
   Substitute: 2x² + 8(x-4) = 26 → 2x² + 8x - 32 = 26 → 2x² + 8x - 58 = 0 → x² + 4x - 29 = 0
   Solutions: x = [-4 ± √(16+116)]/2 = [-4 ± √132]/2 → irrational, no integer solutions.

The proposed answer (4) doesn't yield integer solutions, while the ground truth (26) does. They are not equivalent.
