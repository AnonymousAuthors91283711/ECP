Explanation: The problem describes a recurrence relation with specific boundary conditions. The enumerated values at n=0,3,6,10 suggest a pattern where the non-zero values occur at triangular numbers (0,1,3,6,10). The value at n=0 is 1 and at n=10 is 1, while intermediate triangular numbers (3,6) are 0. This suggests a periodic behavior with period 12, where only certain triangular indices have non-zero values. The simplest rational satisfying p 0 = 1 is 1/8.
