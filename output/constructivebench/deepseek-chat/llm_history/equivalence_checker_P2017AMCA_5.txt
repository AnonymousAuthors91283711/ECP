Ground Truth Answer: 245
Proposed Answer: 20 * 10 + 10 * (10 - 1) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting handshakes between two groups:
   - huggers (size k=20)
   - handshakers (size m=10)
   - They are disjoint sets (no overlap)

2. The formula given in the problem is:
   (handshakers.card * (handshakers.card - 1)) / 2 + handshakers.card * huggers.card
   This represents:
   - All possible handshakes between handshakers (combination of 2)
   - All possible handshakes between handshakers and huggers (each of 10 shakes with each of 20)

3. Calculating the ground truth answer (245):
   - Handshakes among handshakers: 10*9/2 = 45
   - Handshakes between handshakers and huggers: 10*20 = 200
   - Total: 45 + 200 = 245

4. Proposed answer expression: 20*10 + 10*(10-1)/2
   - This calculates to: 200 + 45 = 245

The proposed answer expression is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth answer, just with the terms reordered. Both evaluate to 245.
