Ground Truth Answer: fun n k => if n = 2 * k then 2 else 1
Proposed Answer: fun n k => choose (n - 1) k
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is about finding the minimal number of guesses needed to uniquely identify a secret string s ∈ (Fin n → Fin 2), given that all guesses are at Hamming distance exactly k from the secret.

For the ground truth:
- When n = 2k, the answer is 2 (this is the special case where we need two guesses)
- Otherwise, 1 guess suffices

The proposed answer gives (n-1 choose k), which grows combinatorially with n and k. This is clearly different from the ground truth answer which is either 1 or 2.

For example:
1. n=4, k=2 (n=2k case):
   - Ground truth: 2
   - Proposed: choose(3,2)=3
   - Different

2. n=5, k=2 (general case):
   - Ground truth: 1
   - Proposed: choose(4,2)=6
   - Different

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the ground truth in any case.
