Ground Truth Answer: fun i => match i with
  | 0 => 6
  | 1 => 12
  | 2 => 3
  | 3 => 27
Proposed Answer: fun i => match i with | 0 => 9 | 1 => 15 | 2 => 5 | 3 => 45
Let's analyze the problem and both answers:

1. The problem gives us a system of equations:
   - a + b + c + d = 48
   - a + 3 = b - 3
   - b - 3 = 3 * c
   - 3 * c = d / 3

2. Ground truth solution:
   - a=6, b=12, c=3, d=27
   - Verification:
     - 6 + 12 + 3 + 27 = 48 ✔
     - 6 + 3 = 12 - 3 → 9 = 9 ✔
     - 12 - 3 = 3*3 → 9 = 9 ✔
     - 3*3 = 27/3 → 9 = 9 ✔

3. Proposed solution:
   - a=9, b=15, c=5, d=45
   - Verification:
     - 9 + 15 + 5 + 45 = 74 ≠ 48 ✗
     - 9 + 3 = 15 - 3 → 12 = 12 ✔
     - 15 - 3 = 3*5 → 12 = 15 ✗
     - 3*5 = 45/3 → 15 = 15 ✔

The proposed solution fails to satisfy all equations (fails the sum and one equation). Therefore, it's not equivalent to the ground truth.
