theorem P2021AMCA_3 :
  ∃ (a b : ℕ), a + b = 17402 ∧ 10 ∣ a ∧ b = a / 10 ∧ a - b = P2021AMCA_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the problem statement, we need to find natural numbers a and b such that:
1. a + b = 17402
2. 10 divides a
3. b = a / 10
4. a - b = answer

From condition 3, b = a/10, and from condition 2, a must be divisible by 10. Substituting b into condition 1:
a + a/10 = 17402 → 11a/10 = 17402 → a = 17402 * 10 / 11 = 15820
Then b = 15820/10 = 1582
Thus a - b = 15820 - 1582 = 14238

<<<14238>>>
