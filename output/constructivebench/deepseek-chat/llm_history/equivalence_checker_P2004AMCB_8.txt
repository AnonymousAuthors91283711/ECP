  IsLeast {k : ℕ | Finset.sum (Finset.range k) (fun i => 2 * i + 1) = n} (P2004AMCB_8_answer n) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => Int.toNat ⌊(Real.sqrt (1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2⌋
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => Nat.ceil (Real.sqrt n)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
- We need to find the smallest k such that the sum of the first k odd numbers equals n.
- The sum of first k odd numbers is known to be k² (since 1+3+5+...+(2k-1) = k²).
- So we're looking for the smallest k where k² ≥ n, which is exactly the ceiling of √n.

Ground Truth Answer Analysis:
- The formula (√(1+8n)-1)/2 comes from solving the quadratic equation k(k+1)/2 = n (which is the sum of first k natural numbers, not odd numbers).
- This is incorrect for the given problem since we need the sum of odd numbers.

Proposed Answer Analysis:
- The proposed answer Nat.ceil (Real.sqrt n) is exactly correct for this problem since we need the smallest integer k where k² ≥ n.
- This matches our problem analysis perfectly.

Conclusion:
The ground truth answer is actually incorrect for this problem (it solves a different sum problem), while the proposed answer is correct.
