Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), (2, 0, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), (2, 1, 1)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation is x^5 + x^4 + 1 = 3^y * 7^z
2. We need to find all natural number triples (x, y, z) that satisfy this equation

Checking the ground truth answer:
- (0,0,0): 0+0+1 = 1 = 3^0*7^0 ✔
- (1,1,0): 1+1+1 = 3 = 3^1*7^0 ✔
- (2,0,2): 32+16+1 = 49 = 3^0*7^2 ✔

Checking the proposed answer:
- (1,0,0): 1+1+1 = 3 ≠ 1 ❌ (incorrect)
- (1,1,0): correct as above ✔
- (1,0,1): 3 ≠ 7 ❌ (incorrect)
- (2,1,1): 49 ≠ 21 ❌ (incorrect)

The proposed answer contains only one correct solution (1,1,0) and misses two correct solutions from the ground truth while adding three incorrect ones.
