Ground Truth Answer: Real.sqrt 2
Proposed Answer: (sqrt 17 + 1) / 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal value of |α| + |γ| under certain complex constraints involving quadratic functions evaluated at z=1 and z=i.

2. The ground truth answer is √2 ≈ 1.4142

3. The proposed answer is (√17 + 1)/2 ≈ (4.1231 + 1)/2 ≈ 2.5616

The proposed answer is significantly larger than the ground truth answer, and they are clearly different values. The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the minimality condition required by the problem.
