Ground Truth Answer: fun m a b c i => 
    let S := a + b + c
    match i with
    | 0 => (1 / (m - 1)) * (c - S / (m + 2))
    | 1 => (1 / (m - 1)) * (b - S / (m + 2))
    | 2 => (1 / (m - 1)) * (a - S / (m + 2))
Proposed Answer: fun m a b c i => 
  if i = 0 then (a + b + c) / (3 + m) + (a - (b + c)/2) / (1 - m)
  else if i = 1 then (a + b + c) / (3 + m) + (b - (a + c)/2) / (1 - m)
  else (a + b + c) / (3 + m) + (c - (a + b)/2) / (1 - m)
Let me analyze the two answers carefully.

The ground truth answer is structured as:
1. Computes S = a + b + c
2. For each index i, it returns (1/(m-1)) * (term - S/(m+2)) where term cycles through c, b, a

The proposed answer:
1. For each index, it has two parts:
   - (a+b+c)/(3+m) [similar to S/(m+2) since 3+m = m+2+1]
   - A second term that's (variable - average of other two)/(1-m)

Looking at the structure:
- Both answers have denominators (m-1) and (m+2 or 3+m)
- Both answers have symmetry in handling a,b,c
- The exact forms are different but might be algebraically equivalent

Testing with concrete values (m=0, a=1, b=2, c=3):
Ground truth:
S=6
i=0: (1/-1)*(3 - 6/2) = -0
i=1: (1/-1)*(2 - 6/2) = 1
i=2: (1/-1)*(1 - 6/2) = 2

Proposed:
i=0: 6/3 + (1-5/2)/1 = 2 + (-1.5) = 0.5 (doesn't match 0)
This shows they're not equivalent.
