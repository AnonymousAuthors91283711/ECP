Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ (a m : ℕ), ∀ (n : ℕ), f n = a * n ^ m}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ k : ℕ, ∀ n : ℕ, f n = n^k}
<<<Close>>>

The proposed answer is a subset of the ground truth answer (where a=1), but doesn't cover all cases where a could be any natural number. The ground truth answer allows for an arbitrary multiplicative constant 'a' and any exponent 'm', while the proposed answer only allows functions of the form n^k (equivalent to setting a=1). Therefore, the proposed answer is partially correct but incomplete.
