Ground Truth Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ (a : ℚ) (b : ℝ), f = fun x => (a : ℝ) * x + b}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ a : ℝ → ℝ, ∃ b : ℝ, (∀ x, f x = a x + b) ∧ (∀ q : ℚ, a (algebraMap ℚ ℝ q) = 0) ∧ Continuous a}
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground Truth: Linear functions with rational slope and arbitrary intercept (f(x) = a*x + b where a ∈ ℚ, b ∈ ℝ)
Proposed Answer: Functions that can be written as f(x) = a(x) + b where a is continuous, vanishes on ℚ, and b is constant

Key differences:
1. The ground truth requires exact linearity with rational slope, while the proposed answer allows for any continuous function a(x) that vanishes on ℚ.
2. The proposed answer is more general - it includes all functions of the form f(x) = b + a(x) where a is continuous and zero on ℚ. This includes non-linear functions.
3. The ground truth solution is a strict subset of the proposed solution.

The proposed answer is incorrect because it's too broad - it allows for many non-linear functions that wouldn't satisfy the original condition about preserving rational differences.
