Ground Truth Answer: 294
Proposed Answer: 36
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the greatest natural number n that satisfies two conditions:
   - n can be expressed as k² + 5 for some natural number k
   - n can also be expressed as m*(m+7) for some natural number m

2. Ground truth answer is 294:
   - 294 = 17² + 5 (289 + 5)
   - 294 = 14 * (14 + 7) = 14 * 21

3. Proposed answer is 36:
   - 36 = 5.567² + 5 (but 5.567 isn't a natural number)
   - 36 = 4 * (4 + 7) = 4 * 11 (this part is correct)
   - However, 36 cannot be expressed as k² + 5 for any natural k

The proposed answer fails the first condition (k² + 5) since √31 ≈ 5.567 isn't a natural number. The ground truth answer 294 satisfies both conditions properly.
