theorem omnimath4341 (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) :
  (∑ i ∈ Finset.range n, ∑ j ∈ Finset.range n, ⌊((i + 1) * (j + 1) : ℚ) / (n + 1)⌋) = (n^2 * (n - 1)) / 4 ↔ omnimath4341_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => Nat.Prime (n + 1)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => Even n
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding a condition under which a certain double sum equals (n²*(n-1))/4.

2. The ground truth answer states that this equality holds when n+1 is prime.

3. The proposed answer states that this equality holds when n is even.

These are clearly different conditions:
- For n=4 (n+1=5 is prime), ground truth says true, proposed says true (4 is even)
- For n=5 (n+1=6 is not prime), ground truth says false, proposed says false (5 is odd)
- For n=6 (n+1=7 is prime), ground truth says true, proposed says true (6 is even)
- For n=7 (n+1=8 is not prime), ground truth says false, proposed says false (7 is odd)
- For n=8 (n+1=9 is not prime), ground truth says false, but proposed says true (8 is even)

The answers disagree when n=8, showing they are not equivalent.
