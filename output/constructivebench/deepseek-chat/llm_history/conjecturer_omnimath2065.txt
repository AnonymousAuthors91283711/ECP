<<<10>>>

Explanation: The problem seeks the minimal sum a+b+c+d where a,b,c,d are positive integers with specific gcd conditions. The enumerated pattern suggests 10 is the minimal sum, achieved by (1,2,1,6) or similar permutations. The conditions require pairwise non-coprime adjacent numbers while maintaining gcd(a,c)=1 and gcd(b,d)=1.
