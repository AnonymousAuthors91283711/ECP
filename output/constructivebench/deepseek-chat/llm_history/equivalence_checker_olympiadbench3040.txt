Ground Truth Answer: 27 / 106
Proposed Answer: 3 / 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. First, let's compute the sums in the given equation:
   - ∑(3i) from 1 to n = 3 * n(n+1)/2
   - ∑(5i) from 1 to n = 5 * n(n+1)/2
   The given ratio is (3n(n+1)/2)/(5n(n+1)/2) = 3/5, but the problem states this equals 4/11. This is impossible since 3/5 ≠ 4/11.

2. This suggests there might be a typo in the problem statement, but assuming it's correct as written, the ground truth answer is 27/106 while the proposed answer is 3/7.

3. The proposed answer 3/7 is clearly different from 27/106 (as 3/7 ≈ 0.4286 while 27/106 ≈ 0.2547).

4. Moreover, the problem seems to have an inconsistency in its premise, making any answer questionable.

Given these observations:
<<<False>>>
