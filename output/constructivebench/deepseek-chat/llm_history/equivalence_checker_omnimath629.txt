Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 2^(2 * n)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 3^n
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a set T consisting of triples (A, B, C) where:
   - A is a subset of B
   - The complement of A (Sn \ A) is a subset of C

2. For each element x in Sn (which has n elements), there are three possibilities:
   - x ∈ A (which implies x ∈ B and x can be anything in C)
   - x ∉ A but x ∈ B (which implies x ∉ C since Sn \ A must be subset of C)
   - x ∉ A and x ∉ B (which implies x ∈ C since x ∈ Sn \ A)

3. The ground truth answer 2^(2n) comes from:
   - For each element, we have two choices for A (in or out)
   - Then for each element not in A, it must be in C (no choice)
   - For elements in A, they can be in C or not (another choice)
   - This gives 2^n * 2^n = 2^(2n) possibilities

4. The proposed answer 3^n would correspond to each element having 3 independent choices, which isn't the case here because the choices are constrained (C depends on A and B).

The proposed answer doesn't match the correct counting, which should be 2^(2n).
