Ground Truth Answer: (4, 5)
Proposed Answer: ⟨4, 5⟩
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer ⟨4, 5⟩ is equivalent to the ground truth answer (4, 5) in Lean/mathlib, as both represent the same pair of natural numbers. The different notations (parentheses vs angle brackets) are just syntactic variations for constructing the same product type ℕ × ℕ. The content and meaning are identical.
