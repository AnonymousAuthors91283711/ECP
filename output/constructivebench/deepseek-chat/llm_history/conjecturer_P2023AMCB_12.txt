noncomputable abbrev P2023AMCB_12_answer : ℝ := sorry
def custom_op (u v : ℂ) : ℂ := re u * re v + im u * im v * I

theorem P2023AMCB_12 (z : ℂ) :
    custom_op z z = z ^ 2 + 40 ↔ Complex.abs z = P2023AMCB_12_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the problem statement and the custom operation definition, we can see that `custom_op z z` is similar to squaring but only multiplies real parts and imaginary parts separately. The equation simplifies to a condition on the magnitude of z. The enumerated answers suggest the solution relates to the magnitude.
