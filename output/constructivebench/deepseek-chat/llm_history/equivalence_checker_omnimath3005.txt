Ground Truth Answer: 19
Proposed Answer: 21
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the sum of digits of a 3-digit number N (100 ≤ N < 1000) that leaves remainder 7 when divided by 10, 11, and 12.

2. The conditions mean:
   - N ≡ 7 mod 10
   - N ≡ 7 mod 11
   - N ≡ 7 mod 12

3. This is equivalent to N ≡ 7 mod lcm(10,11,12) = 660
   (since lcm(10,11,12) = 660)

4. The only 3-digit number satisfying N ≡ 7 mod 660 is 660 + 7 = 667

5. Now calculate the digit sum of 667: 6 + 6 + 7 = 19

The ground truth answer (19) is correct, while the proposed answer (21) is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
