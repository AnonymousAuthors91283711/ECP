Ground Truth Answer: 7
Proposed Answer: let a := fun n => (Nat.digits 2 n).count 1; a 2024
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer defines a function `a` that counts the number of 1's in the binary representation of `n` (which is what `(Nat.digits 2 n).count 1` does). 

The problem's conditions are satisfied by this function:
1. `a 0 = 0` (binary 0 has no 1's)
2. `a 1 = 1` (binary 1 has one 1)
3. Doubling a number appends a 0 in binary, so `a (2*n) = a n`
4. Doubling and adding 1 appends a 1 in binary, so `a (2*n+1) = a n + 1`

The binary representation of 2024 is 11111100000, which contains 7 ones, matching the ground truth answer of 7. Therefore, the answers are equivalent.
