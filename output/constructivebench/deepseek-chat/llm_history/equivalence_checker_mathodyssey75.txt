Ground Truth Answer: {√2 / 2, -√2 / 2}
Proposed Answer: Set.Icc (-(√2 / 2)) (√2 / 2)
<<<Close>>>

The proposed answer (Set.Icc (-(√2 / 2)) (√2 / 2)) is a superset of the ground truth answer ({√2 / 2, -√2 / 2}). The ground truth correctly identifies the exact maximum and minimum values, while the proposed answer suggests all values in between are also achievable, which isn't supported by the problem statement. The proposed answer is correct about the bounds but incorrect about the completeness of the set.
