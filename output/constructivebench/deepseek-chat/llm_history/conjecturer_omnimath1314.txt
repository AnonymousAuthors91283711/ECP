theorem omnimath1314 : 
  HasSum (fun n : ℕ => (1 : ℚ) / ((n + 3)^2 + (n + 1))) omnimath1314_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<1 / 2>>> 

The pattern from enumeration suggests the series converges to 1/2. The general term 1/((n+3)^2 + (n+1)) simplifies to terms that telescope when summed, leading to this rational result.
