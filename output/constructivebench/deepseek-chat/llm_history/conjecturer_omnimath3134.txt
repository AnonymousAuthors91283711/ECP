abbrev omnimath3134_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3134
(P Q R S : ℝ)
(hPQ : Q - P = 1)
(hQR : R - Q = 2 * (Q - P))
(hRS : S - R = 3 * (R - Q))
: S - P = omnimath3134_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Looking at the pattern in the differences:
- Q-P = 1
- R-Q = 2*1 = 2
- S-R = 3*2 = 6
Thus S-P = (S-R)+(R-Q)+(Q-P) = 6+2+1 = 9
