Ground Truth Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | (∀ x : ℝ, (0 ≤ x ∧ x < 2) → f x = 2/(2 - x)) ∧ (∀ x : ℝ, x ≥ 2 → f x = 0) ∧ f 2 = 0 ∧ (∀ x y : ℝ, f (x * f y) * f y = f (x + y))}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c > 0, ∀ x, f x = if x < 2 then c * (2 - x) else 0}
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. The ground truth answer specifies:
   - For 0 ≤ x < 2: f(x) = 2/(2 - x)
   - For x ≥ 2: f(x) = 0
   - f(2) = 0
   - Functional equation f(x*f(y))*f(y) = f(x+y)

2. The proposed answer suggests:
   - For x < 2: f(x) = c*(2 - x) (with c > 0)
   - For x ≥ 2: f(x) = 0

Key differences:
- The functional form is different (2/(2-x) vs c*(2-x))
- The ground truth has a specific form while the proposed answer has a parameter c
- The proposed answer's form doesn't satisfy the functional equation f(x*f(y))*f(y) = f(x+y) unless c=1, but even then it's not equivalent to 2/(2-x)

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It doesn't match the exact form of the ground truth solution
2. The functional equation wouldn't hold for arbitrary c > 0
3. The specific solution 2/(2-x) is unique (up to scaling) for this problem
