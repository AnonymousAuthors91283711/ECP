Looking at the problem and the proposed answer, we can analyze the logarithmic expressions and simplify them. The key observations are:

1. From h1: logb a c = T ⇒ c = a^T
2. From h2: logb b d = T ⇒ d = b^T
3. The numerator is logb (sqrt(a*b)) (c*d)^3 = logb (sqrt(a*b)) (a^T * b^T)^3 = logb (sqrt(a*b)) (a*b)^(3T)
4. Using logarithm properties, this simplifies to 3T * (logb (sqrt(a*b)) (a*b)) = 3T * 2 = 6T (since log_x x^2 = 2)
5. The denominator is logb a c + logb b d = T + T = 2T
6. The final expression is 6T / 2T = 3

The proposed answer had a miscalculation in the numerator simplification. The correct simplified form should be a constant function since all variables cancel out. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<fun _ _ _ _ _ => 3>>> 

This matches the expected behavior where the result is independent of the specific values of a, b, c, d, T (as long as T ≠ 0). The error in the original proposal was both mathematical (incorrect simplification) and technical (needed noncomputable annotation). The fixed version avoids both issues.
