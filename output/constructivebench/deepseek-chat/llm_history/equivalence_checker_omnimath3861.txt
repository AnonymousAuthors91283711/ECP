open Function Nat

abbrev omnimath3861_answer : Set (ℕ → ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3861 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ a b, 0 < a → 0 < b → a + b > 2019 → (a + f b) ∣ (a^2 + b * f a)) ↔ f ∈ omnimath3861_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ k, ∀ a, f a = k * a ∧ 0 < f a}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c, f = fun n => n + c}
<<<False>>>
