Ground Truth Answer: 8/9
Proposed Answer: 1/16
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a polynomial P with roots at 1/4, 1/2, 2, and 4 (with possible multiplicities)
2. The polynomial must satisfy:
   - Product of roots times leading coefficient equals 1
   - P(1) = 1
   - P(0) is the answer we're evaluating

The ground truth answer is 8/9 while the proposed answer is 1/16.

To verify, let's construct the polynomial:
1. Start with P(x) = a(x-1/4)(x-1/2)(x-2)(x-4)
2. The product of roots is (1/4)*(1/2)*2*4 = 1
3. The condition a*(product of roots)=1 ⇒ a=1
4. Now P(1) = (1-1/4)(1-1/2)(1-2)(1-4) = (3/4)(1/2)(-1)(-3) = 9/8 ≠ 1
5. To make P(1)=1, we need to scale: P(x) = (8/9)(x-1/4)(x-1/2)(x-2)(x-4)
6. Now P(0) = (8/9)(-1/4)(-1/2)(-2)(-4) = (8/9)(1/4)(1/2)(2)(4) = 8/9

The proposed answer 1/16 would be correct if we didn't have the P(1)=1 condition (using a=1), but with that condition, the correct answer is indeed 8/9.
