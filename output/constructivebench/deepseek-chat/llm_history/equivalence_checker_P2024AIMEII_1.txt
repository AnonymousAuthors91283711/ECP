Ground Truth Answer: 73
Proposed Answer: 109
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem is using the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets (diamond, golf, spade, candy).

2. The correct formula for four sets is:
|A∪B∪C∪D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D| - |A∩B∩C∩D|

3. The given values:
- exactly_two (437) represents the sum of all pairwise intersections
- exactly_three (234) represents the sum of all triple intersections
- all_four is what we're trying to find

4. The formula provided in the theorem is correct:
all_four = (sum of single sets - sum of pairwise intersections - 2*sum of triple intersections - total) / 2

5. Plugging in the numbers:
(195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - 437 - 2*234 - 900)/2
= (2024 - 437 - 468 - 900)/2
= (2024 - 1805)/2
= 219/2 = 109.5

6. However, the ground truth answer is 73, which doesn't match our calculation. The proposed answer of 109 is actually closer to what the formula gives (though we get 109.5, suggesting a possible rounding error).

7. The discrepancy suggests there might be different interpretations of "exactly_two" and "exactly_three" in the ground truth vs the proposed answer.
