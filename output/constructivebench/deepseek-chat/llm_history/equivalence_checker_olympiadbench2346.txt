Ground Truth Answer: {10^(100 : ℝ), 10^(1/100)}
Proposed Answer: {x | x = (10 : ℝ) ^ (10 : ℝ) ^ (2 : ℝ) ∨ x = (10 : ℝ) ^ (10 : ℝ) ^ (-2 : ℝ)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all positive real x where (log x)^(log (log x)) = 10000.

2. Ground truth gives two solutions: 10^100 and 10^(1/100).

3. Proposed answer gives solutions in the form: x = 10^(10^2) or x = 10^(10^(-2)).

Let's evaluate the proposed answer:
- 10^(10^2) = 10^100
- 10^(10^(-2)) = 10^(1/100)

These are exactly the same as the ground truth solutions, just written in a different form (using exponentiation instead of fractions for the second term).

The proposed answer is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth, just using a different but equally valid representation.
