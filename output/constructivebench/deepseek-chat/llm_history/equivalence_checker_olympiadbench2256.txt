Ground Truth Answer: 1000
Proposed Answer: 100
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is a logarithmic equation that needs to be solved for x > 0.

2. The equation can be simplified using logarithm properties:
   - log(x²) = 2logx
   - The equation becomes: 2^(2logx/log10) = 3*2^(1 + logx/log10) + 16

3. Let's substitute y = 2^(logx/log10), which transforms the equation to:
   y² = 3*2y + 16
   => y² - 6y - 16 = 0

4. Solving this quadratic equation gives y = 8 or y = -2. Since y must be positive, we take y = 8.

5. Now solve 2^(logx/log10) = 8:
   => logx/log10 = 3
   => log₁₀x = 3 (since log10 = log₁₀10 = 1)
   => x = 10³ = 1000

The ground truth answer is 1000, while the proposed answer is 100. These are clearly different values.
