The error occurs because the trigonometric function `cos` isn't available in the current context. We need to import the necessary mathematical components. The proposed answer appears to be trying to capture all real solutions to the system of equations, which includes both the trivial solution (3) and cyclic trigonometric solutions.

Looking at the pattern, the trigonometric part suggests solutions involving roots of unity, but we need to adjust the indexing since `n : ℕ` would produce duplicate values. Instead, we should use specific angles that give distinct cosine values.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<{3} ∪ {1 + 2 * Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 3), 1 + 2 * Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 3)}>>>

Explanation:
1. The error is fixed by using `Real.cos` and `Real.pi` from the `Real` namespace
2. Instead of using a general `n : ℕ`, we explicitly list the two non-trivial cosine values that satisfy the equations (for n=1 and n=2 in the original formulation)
3. The union with {3} captures both the trivial solution and the cyclic solutions
4. The angles 2π/3 and 4π/3 correspond to the principal roots giving distinct cosine values (-1/2)
