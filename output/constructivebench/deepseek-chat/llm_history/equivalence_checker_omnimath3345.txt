Ground Truth Answer: fun x => x^(9900) * ((1 + x^100)/2)^2
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℝ => (x^100 + 1)^100 / x^5050
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves a double product (from m=0 to 99 and n=0 to 99) of a complex rational expression in x.

2. The ground truth answer suggests:
   - A leading term x^9900
   - A squared term ((1 + x^100)/2)^2

3. The proposed answer suggests:
   - A numerator (x^100 + 1)^100
   - A denominator x^5050

Comparing the two:
- The exponents don't match: 9900 vs (100*100 - 5050) = 4950
- The structure is different: ground truth has a simple squared term, while proposed answer has a 100th power
- The proposed answer's denominator suggests a different interpretation of the product's simplification

The answers are fundamentally different in both structure and exponents. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth.
