Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a set S of real number pairs (x,y) that satisfy both equations:
   - x + y = 1
   - x - y = 1

2. To find the cardinality of S, we need to solve this system of equations:
   - Adding the equations: 2x = 2 ⇒ x = 1
   - Substituting x=1 into first equation: 1 + y = 1 ⇒ y = 0

3. The only solution is (1,0), meaning S is a singleton set containing just this one point.

4. The ground truth answer claims there are 3 solutions, which is incorrect for this system of linear equations.

5. The proposed answer of 1 is correct, as there's exactly one solution to this system.

The ground truth answer appears to be wrong, while the proposed answer is correct.
