Ground Truth Answer: 5 / 3
Proposed Answer: (2^2 + 1) / (2^2 - 1)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer (2² + 1)/(2² - 1) = (4 + 1)/(4 - 1) = 5/3 is indeed equivalent to the ground truth answer 5/3. The simplification is correct, and both expressions represent the same value. The original problem's expression (2²⁰¹⁴ + 2²⁰¹²)/(2²⁰¹⁴ - 2²⁰¹²) simplifies to 5/3 when you factor out 2²⁰¹² from both numerator and denominator.
