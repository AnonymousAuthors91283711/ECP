Explanation: The condition requires that for each element s in S, its divisors d must correspond uniquely to another element t in S with gcd(s,t)=d. This property is satisfied by sets of numbers that are pairwise coprime or have specific multiplicative relationships. The powers of 2 satisfy this condition perfectly since their divisors form a complete lattice under division.
