theorem P2003AMCA_5 :
  ∃ A M C : Fin 10,      (10000 * A + 1000 * M + 100 * C + 10) + 
    (10000 * A + 1000 * M + 100 * C + 12) = 123422 ∧
    A + M + C = P2003AMCA_5_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 14
Proposed Answer: 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find digits A, M, C (each between 0-9) such that:
   - (AMC10 + AMC12) = 123422
   - A + M + C equals some answer value

2. Let's break down the equation:
   AMC10 + AMC12 = 2*AMC0 + 22 = 123422
   => 2*AMC0 = 123400
   => AMC0 = 61700

3. This means:
   A=6, M=1, C=7
   So A + M + C = 6 + 1 + 7 = 14

4. The ground truth answer is 14, which matches our calculation
5. The proposed answer is 5, which is incorrect

<<<False>>>
