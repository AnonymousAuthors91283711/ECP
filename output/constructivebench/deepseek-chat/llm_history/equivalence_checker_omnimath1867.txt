Ground Truth Answer: 1441 / 2016
Proposed Answer: ↑(φ 2015) / ↑2016
Let's analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting numbers from 1 to 2016 that are coprime with 2015, then dividing by 2016 (the total numbers).

2. The ground truth answer is 1441/2016.

3. The proposed answer uses Euler's totient function φ(2015)/2016.

4. First, let's factorize 2015: 2015 = 5 × 13 × 31.

5. Calculating φ(2015) = φ(5) × φ(13) × φ(31) = 4 × 12 × 30 = 1440.

6. However, the ground truth is 1441/2016, which suggests φ(2015) + 1 = 1441.

7. The discrepancy comes from the range: Finset.Icc 1 2016 includes 2016, but φ(2015) counts numbers up to 2015. Since 2016 is not coprime with 2015 (they share factor 1), the count should be φ(2015).

8. Therefore, the correct answer should be φ(2015)/2016 = 1440/2016, not 1441/2016.

9. The proposed answer is mathematically correct (φ(2015)/2016), but the ground truth answer is incorrect (should be 1440/2016).
