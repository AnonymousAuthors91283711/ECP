Ground Truth Answer: 79
Proposed Answer: 89
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the largest two-digit number N (between 10 and 99) where:
   - The reverse of N is prime
   - The reverse of 4*N is prime
   - The reverse of 5*N is prime

2. For the ground truth answer 79:
   - Reverse of 79 is 97 (prime)
   - 4*79 = 316 → reverse is 613 (prime)
   - 5*79 = 395 → reverse is 593 (prime)

3. For the proposed answer 89:
   - Reverse of 89 is 98 (not prime, as 98 = 2 × 49)
   - This already fails the first condition

The proposed answer 89 fails the first condition (reverse must be prime), while the ground truth answer 79 satisfies all conditions. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
