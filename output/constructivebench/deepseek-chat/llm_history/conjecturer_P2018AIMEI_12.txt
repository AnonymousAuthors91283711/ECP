Looking at the problem, we need to count subsets of {1,2,...,18} whose sum is divisible by 3. The total number of subsets is 2^18 (given). For the count of "good" subsets, we can use generating functions or symmetry arguments to find that it's (2^18 + 2)/3.

The error in the proposed answer is due to incorrect Lean syntax for pairs. In Lean, pairs should be constructed using angle brackets ⟨ ⟩ rather than parentheses. Also, we need to ensure integer division is handled properly.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<⟨(2^18 + 2)/3, 2^18⟩>>>

Explanation:
1. The total number of subsets is clearly 2^18 (second component)
2. For the count of subsets with sum divisible by 3:
   - There are 3 possible remainders (0,1,2) when dividing sum by 3
   - By symmetry, each remainder occurs roughly equally often
   - The exact count is (2^n + 2)/3 when n ≡ 0 mod 3 (here n=18)
3. The gcd condition holds since (2^18 + 2)/3 and 2^18 are coprime
