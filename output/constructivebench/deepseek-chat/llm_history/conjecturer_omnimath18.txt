<<<2017 * 1008>>> 

Explanation: The problem seeks the maximum total sum where each pair (a,b) in orders contributes min(cost a, cost b). For maximal sum, we want as many pairs as possible with both elements having high costs. The optimal configuration is a complete bipartite graph where costs are balanced. For 2017 pairs (odd number), the best balance is 1008 and 1009, giving min(1008,1009)=1008 per pair. Thus total is 2017*1008.
