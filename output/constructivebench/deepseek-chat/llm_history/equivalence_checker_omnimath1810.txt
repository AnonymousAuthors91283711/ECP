Ground Truth Answer: { (3, 3), (-4, -4), ((1 + 3 * Real.sqrt 5) / 2, (1 - 3 * Real.sqrt 5) / 2), ((1 - 3 * Real.sqrt 5) / 2, (1 + 3 * Real.sqrt 5) / 2) }
Proposed Answer: {(3, 3), ((-1 - √45)/2, (-1 + √45)/2), ((-1 + √45)/2, (-1 - √45)/2)}
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. The ground truth answer has 4 points:
   - (3,3)
   - (-4,-4)
   - Two points involving (1 ± 3√5)/2

2. The proposed answer has 3 points:
   - (3,3)
   - Two points involving (-1 ± √45)/2

First, let's check if the expressions are equivalent:
- √45 = 3√5, so √45 is equivalent to 3√5
- The proposed answer uses (-1 ± √45)/2 while the ground truth uses (1 ± 3√5)/2
- These are different expressions and will yield different numerical values

Now let's check if (-4,-4) is missing:
- (-4,-4) is indeed a solution since (-4)^2 + (-4) = 16-4 = 12 and (-4)^2 + (-4) = 12
- This point is missing from the proposed answer

The proposed answer is missing one solution (-4,-4) and has incorrect expressions for two other solutions. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
