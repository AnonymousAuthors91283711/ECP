  natalie = omnimath2994_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 176
Proposed Answer: 171 * 3 - 161 - 171
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem gives us:
   - jiayin = 161 (given)
   - (natalie + harpreet + jiayin)/3 = 171 (average condition)

2. The ground truth answer is 176, which comes from:
   - Total sum = 171 * 3 = 513
   - natalie + harpreet = 513 - 161 = 352
   - But we can't determine natalie individually from this

3. The proposed answer is:
   171 * 3 - 161 - 171 = 513 - 161 - 171 = 181

The proposed answer (181) doesn't match the ground truth (176), and more importantly, the proposed calculation doesn't make sense because we don't have enough information to determine natalie individually (we'd need harpreet's value or another equation).
