  (h_ray : gas_ray = miles / 40) (h_tom : gas_tom = miles / 10) :
  2 * miles / (gas_ray + gas_tom) = P2013AMCB_4_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 16
Proposed Answer: 80
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about calculating a combined efficiency given two different consumption rates (Ray uses 40 miles per gallon, Tom uses 10 miles per gallon).

2. The formula given is: 2 * miles / (gas_ray + gas_tom)
   - gas_ray = miles / 40
   - gas_tom = miles / 10

3. Plugging these into the formula:
   2 * miles / (miles/40 + miles/10) = 2 * miles / (miles*(1/40 + 1/10)) = 2 / (1/40 + 1/10) = 2 / (0.025 + 0.1) = 2 / 0.125 = 16

4. The ground truth answer is 16, which matches our calculation.

5. The proposed answer is 80, which is incorrect as it's 5 times the correct answer (possibly from miscalculating the denominator).
