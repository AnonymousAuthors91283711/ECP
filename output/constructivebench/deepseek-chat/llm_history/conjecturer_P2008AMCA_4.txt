theorem P2008AMCA_4 : 
  (∏ n in Finset.range 502, (4 * (n + 2)) / (4 * (n + 1))) = P2008AMCA_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern in the product, we can observe that it telescopes:
- Numerator terms: 4*3, 4*4, ..., 4*503
- Denominator terms: 4*2, 4*3, ..., 4*502
Most terms cancel out, leaving (4*503)/(4*2) = 503/2
But since we need a natural number answer, we must have made an error in counting the terms. The product has 502 terms (from n=0 to n=501), so the correct cancellation gives (4*503)/(4*2) * (4*504)/(4*3) * ... * (4*503)/(4*502) - but this doesn't simplify to a natural number. Wait, perhaps the enumeration shows the answer is 1006.
