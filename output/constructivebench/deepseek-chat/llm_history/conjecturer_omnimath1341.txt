From the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we're looking for the greatest sum s = a + b = c + d where a,b,c,d are distinct positive integers with certain LCM constraints. The pattern suggests the maximum sum occurs when the numbers are as large as possible while satisfying the LCM condition. The answer appears to be:
