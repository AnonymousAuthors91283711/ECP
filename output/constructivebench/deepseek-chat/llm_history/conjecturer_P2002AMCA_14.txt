Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 7, which is at "P2002AMCA_14_answer " in "abbrev P2002AMCA_14_answer : ℝ := 1 / 2", there is an error: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instDivInvMonoid', and it does not have executable code.

Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to fix the proposed answer and make it compile in Lean. The problem involves logarithms with base 2002 and sums of logarithms of squares of numbers 11, 13, and 14.

The error suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real numbers. The proposed answer of 1/2 seems reasonable because:

1. The sum of logs is equivalent to the log of the product: logb2002(11²) + logb2002(13²) + logb2002(14²) = logb2002((11×13×14)²)
2. Calculating 11×13×14 = 2002
3. So we have logb2002(2002²) = 2

However, the problem seems to be asking for N, which is the sum of the logs, not the simplified value. The correct answer should be 2, not 1/2.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2002AMCA_14_answer : ℝ := 2>>>

The explanation is:
1. The sum of logarithms with the same base is equivalent to the logarithm of the product
2. The product inside is (11² × 13² × 14²) = (11×13×14)² = 2002²
3. Therefore, logb2002(2002²) = 2 by logarithm properties
4. The answer needs to be marked noncomputable because it involves real number operations
