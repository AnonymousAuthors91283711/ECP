Ground Truth Answer: 15 / 2
Proposed Answer: 5 + sqrt 5
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find real numbers a and b that satisfy two cubic equations, with the condition that a + b equals some value (the answer we're evaluating).

2. The ground truth answer is 15/2 (7.5).

3. The proposed answer is 5 + √5 (approximately 7.236).

Analysis:
- The two answers are clearly different numerical values (7.5 vs ~7.236).
- For cubic equations, there can be multiple real roots, but the sum a + b must be consistent.
- The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth, and there's no indication they're equivalent forms of the same value.

Conclusion: The answers are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
