Ground Truth Answer: 25 / 9
Proposed Answer: 5 * (5 - sqrt 5) / 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum of the minimum pairwise products (a*b, b*c, c*a) under the constraints:
   - a, b, c > 0
   - a + b + c = 10
   - ab + bc + ca = 25

2. The ground truth answer is 25/9 ≈ 2.777...

3. The proposed answer is 5*(5-√5)/2 ≈ 6.8819...

Comparing these:
- The proposed answer is significantly larger than the ground truth answer
- The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the constraints (if you plug it back, it doesn't work)
- The ground truth answer comes from the symmetric case a=b=c=10/3, which satisfies all constraints

The proposed answer is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
