Ground Truth Answer: {1, -1, Complex.I, -Complex.I}
Proposed Answer: {k : ℂ | k ^ 4 = 1}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer {k : ℂ | k^4 = 1} is equivalent to the ground truth answer {1, -1, Complex.I, -Complex.I} because:
1. The solutions to k^4 = 1 in complex numbers are exactly the 4th roots of unity: 1, -1, i, and -i
2. The problem describes a system of equations that reduces to k^4 = 1 when solving the system under the given constraints (a,b,c,d ≠ 0)
3. Both representations describe exactly the same set of complex numbers, just in different forms (explicit enumeration vs equation)
