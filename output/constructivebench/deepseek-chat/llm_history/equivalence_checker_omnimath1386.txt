Ground Truth Answer: 43 / 63
Proposed Answer: (7 * 13) / (3 * 4 * 8 * 9)
Let's analyze both answers:

1. Ground Truth: 43/63
2. Proposed Answer: (7*13)/(3*4*8*9) = 91/864

Now let's compute the actual product:
For n from 2 to 6:
(n³-1)/(n³+1) = 
(8-1)/(8+1) * (27-1)/(27+1) * (64-1)/(64+1) * (125-1)/(125+1) * (216-1)/(216+1) =
7/9 * 26/28 * 63/65 * 124/126 * 215/217

Simplify fractions:
= 7/9 * (13/14) * (63/65) * (62/63) * (215/217)

Now cancel terms:
- 63 cancels between numerator and denominator
= 7/9 * 13/14 * 62/65 * 215/217

Further simplification:
= (7*13*62*215)/(9*14*65*217)
= (7*13*2*31*5*43)/(9*2*7*5*13*7*31)
= (43)/(9*7) = 43/63

The proposed answer (91/864) is not equal to the correct answer (43/63).
