Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: 25
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a sequence where:
   - a1, a2, a3 form an arithmetic sequence with difference d
   - g1, g2, g3 are defined in terms of the a's
   - g1, g2, g3 must form a geometric sequence (g2² = g1*g3)
   - We need to find the minimal possible value of g3

2. Setting up the equations:
   - a1 = 9
   - a2 = 9 + d
   - a3 = 9 + 2d
   - g1 = 9
   - g2 = 11 + d
   - g3 = 29 + 2d
   - The geometric condition: (11 + d)² = 9*(29 + 2d)

3. Solving the equation:
   (11 + d)² = 9*(29 + 2d)
   121 + 22d + d² = 261 + 18d
   d² + 4d - 140 = 0
   Solutions: d = -2 ± √144 → d = 10 or d = -14

4. Calculating g3 for both cases:
   - For d = 10: g3 = 29 + 2*10 = 49
   - For d = -14: g3 = 29 + 2*(-14) = 1

5. The minimal value is clearly 1, not 25.

The proposed answer (25) doesn't match any possible value of g3 in this problem. The ground truth answer (1) is correct.
