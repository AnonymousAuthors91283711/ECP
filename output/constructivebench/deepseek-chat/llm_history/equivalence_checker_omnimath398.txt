Ground Truth Answer: 4012013006001
Proposed Answer: (2001 * 2002 / 2)^2
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. This is because the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers is known to be equal to the square of the sum of those numbers, which is given by the formula (n(n+1)/2)^2. For n=2001, this becomes (2001*2002/2)^2, which evaluates to 4012013006001, matching the ground truth answer.
