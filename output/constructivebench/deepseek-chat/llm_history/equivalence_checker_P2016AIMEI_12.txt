Ground Truth Answer: 132
Proposed Answer: 11 * 19 * 7 * 5 * 3 * 2 * 1 + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest positive integer m where m² - m + 11 is a product of at least 4 distinct primes.

2. The ground truth answer is 132, which satisfies:
   - 132² - 132 + 11 = 17424 - 132 + 11 = 17303
   - 17303 factors into 11 × 13 × 11 × 11 (but this doesn't meet the "distinct primes" requirement)
   - Wait, this suggests the ground truth might be incorrect or needs verification

3. The proposed answer is 11*19*7*5*3*2*1 + 1 = 4381
   - This is a completely different approach that doesn't solve the original problem
   - It's calculating a product of primes plus one, not finding m such that m² - m + 11 is a product of primes
   - The value 4381 is much larger than 132 and doesn't satisfy the problem's conditions

The proposed answer doesn't address the original problem and gives a completely different calculation. Therefore:

<<<False>>>
