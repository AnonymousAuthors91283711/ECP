abbrev omnimath2134_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2134 :
  GCDMonoid.gcd (4 ^ 8 - 1) (8 ^ 12 - 1) = omnimath2134_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 15
Proposed Answer: 255
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for gcd(4⁸ - 1, 8¹² - 1)
2. We can simplify the expressions:
   - 4⁸ - 1 = (2²)⁸ - 1 = 2¹⁶ - 1
   - 8¹² - 1 = (2³)¹² - 1 = 2³⁶ - 1
3. The gcd of (2^m - 1, 2^n - 1) is 2^{gcd(m,n)} - 1
4. gcd(16,36) = 4
5. Therefore, the correct answer should be 2⁴ - 1 = 15

The proposed answer is 255, which would be 2⁸ - 1, but gcd(16,36) is not 8.
