Ground Truth Answer: { (x, y) | x^2 + y^2 = 1 } ∪ { (x, y) | y^2 - x^2 = 1 }
Proposed Answer: {(x, y) | y = x ∨ y = -x ∨ y = sqrt (x^2 + 1) ∨ y = -sqrt (x^2 + 1)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The original equation is y⁴ + 1 = x⁴ + 2y²
2. We can rewrite it as y⁴ - 2y² + 1 = x⁴ → (y² - 1)² = x⁴
3. Taking square roots gives two cases:
   - y² - 1 = x² → y² - x² = 1
   - y² - 1 = -x² → x² + y² = 1

The ground truth answer correctly captures both cases:
- { (x, y) | x² + y² = 1 } (circle)
- { (x, y) | y² - x² = 1 } (hyperbola)

The proposed answer includes:
- y = x and y = -x (which satisfy y² - x² = 0, not 1)
- y = ±sqrt(x² + 1) (which satisfies y² - x² = 1)

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It includes y = ±x which don't satisfy the original equation
2. It misses the circle case (x² + y² = 1) entirely
3. It only partially captures the hyperbola case
