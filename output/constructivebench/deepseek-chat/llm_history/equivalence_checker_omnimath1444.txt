theorem omnimath1444 :
  (floor ((2005 ^ 3 : ℝ) / (2003 * 2004) - (2003 ^ 3 : ℝ) / (2004 * 2005)) = omnimath1444_answer) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 2004 * 2005 + 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves evaluating the floor of a complex expression involving 2003, 2004, and 2005 raised to powers and divided by products.

2. The ground truth answer is simply 8, which suggests that after all the calculations, the floor of the expression evaluates to 8.

3. The proposed answer is 2004 * 2005 + 1, which equals 4,018,021. This is vastly different from 8.

4. To verify, let's consider the magnitude of the expression:
   - 2005³ is about 8 billion
   - Divided by 2003*2004 (about 4 million) gives about 2000
   - Similarly the second term would be about 2000
   - Their difference would be small, nowhere near millions
   - The floor of such an expression would indeed be a small integer like 8

5. The proposed answer is off by several orders of magnitude and doesn't make sense in context.
