Ground Truth Answer: 13/24
Proposed Answer: 1/2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the value c in [0,1] that maximizes the area of certain regions in the unit square where either:
   - x < c < y (with y ∈ [1/2, 2/3])
   - y < c < x (with y ∈ [1/2, 2/3])

2. The ground truth answer is 13/24 ≈ 0.5417
3. The proposed answer is 1/2 = 0.5

To check equivalence:
- For c = 1/2, the area calculation would be different from c = 13/24
- The maximum area occurs at c = 13/24, not at c = 1/2
- The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't maximize the area as required

<<<False>>>
