Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 6), (6, 3)} ∪ { (k, k^3) | k ∈ Set.univ } ∪ { (k^3, k) | k ∈ Set.univ }
Let's analyze the proposed answer versus the ground truth:

1. The ground truth contains only small number pairs that clearly satisfy the conditions when tested manually (e.g., (1,2), (2,3), etc.)

2. The proposed answer includes:
   - (1,1) - Doesn't satisfy the conditions (division by zero would occur)
   - (3,6) and (6,3) - Testing shows these don't satisfy the original equations
   - Infinite sets of (k, k³) and (k³, k) - These generally don't satisfy the conditions except when k=1 (which fails as above)

3. The correct pairs from the ground truth are included in the proposed answer, but the proposed answer contains many incorrect pairs.
