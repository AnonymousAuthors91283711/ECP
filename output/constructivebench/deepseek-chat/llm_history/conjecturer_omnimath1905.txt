Looking at the pattern from enumerating smaller iterations:
n=1 → 0
n=2 → 1
n=3 → 1
n=4 → 3
n=5 → 5
n=6 → 11
n=7 → 21
n=8 → 43
n=9 → 85
n=10 → 171

The pattern matches the Jacobsthal sequence J(n) where J(n) = (2^n - (-1)^n)/3. For n=10: (2^10 - 1)/3 = 341/3 = 113.666... which doesn't match. However, the actual pattern is J(n-1), where J(n) is the nth Jacobsthal number.

<<<(2^9 - (-1)^9) / 3>>>
