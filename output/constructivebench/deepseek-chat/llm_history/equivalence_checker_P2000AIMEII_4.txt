Ground Truth Answer: 180
Proposed Answer: 2^5 * 3^2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest positive integer n where:
   - There are exactly 6 odd divisors
   - There are exactly 12 even divisors

2. The ground truth answer is 180.

3. The proposed answer is 2^5 * 3^2 = 32 * 9 = 288.

Let's verify:
- For 180 (2² * 3² * 5¹):
  - Odd divisors: combinations of 3² * 5¹ → (2+1)(1+1) = 6
  - Even divisors: total divisors (3*3*2=18) minus odd divisors (6) = 12

- For 288 (2^5 * 3^2):
  - Odd divisors: combinations of 3² → (2+1) = 3 (not 6)
  - Even divisors: total divisors (6*3=18) minus odd divisors (3) = 15 (not 12)

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the conditions, while the ground truth does.

<<<False>>>
