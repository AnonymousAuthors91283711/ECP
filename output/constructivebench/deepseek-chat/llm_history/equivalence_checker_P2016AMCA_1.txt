abbrev P2016AMCA_1_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2016AMCA_1 : (11! - 10!) / 9! = P2016AMCA_1_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 100
Proposed Answer: 110
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to compute (11! - 10!)/9!
2. Let's break this down mathematically:
   - 11! = 11 × 10 × 9!
   - 10! = 10 × 9!
   - So (11! - 10!) = (11 × 10 × 9! - 10 × 9!) = (110 × 9! - 10 × 9!) = (110 - 10) × 9! = 100 × 9!
   - Therefore (11! - 10!)/9! = (100 × 9!)/9! = 100

The ground truth answer is 100, which matches our calculation.
The proposed answer is 110, which is incorrect.
