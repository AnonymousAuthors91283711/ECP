Ground Truth Answer: 7/72
Proposed Answer: 1/6 + (5/6) * (1/6) + (5/6) * (4/6) * (1/6) + (5/6) * (4/6) * (3/6) * (1/6)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
- We're counting functions from Fin 4 → Fin 6 where at least one output value appears at least 3 times
- The probability is this count divided by 6^4 (total possible functions)
- The ground truth answer is 7/72 ≈ 0.09722

Proposed Answer Analysis:
The proposed answer looks like a sum of probabilities:
1/6 + (5/6)*(1/6) + (5/6)*(4/6)*(1/6) + (5/6)*(4/6)*(3/6)*(1/6)
= 1/6 + 5/36 + 20/216 + 60/1296
= 216/1296 + 180/1296 + 120/1296 + 60/1296
= 576/1296
= 4/9 ≈ 0.4444

This is clearly different from 7/72 ≈ 0.09722. The proposed answer seems to be calculating something else entirely (perhaps a different probability problem).
