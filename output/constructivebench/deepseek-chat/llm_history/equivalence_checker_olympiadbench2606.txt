Ground Truth Answer: 979
Proposed Answer: 994
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the greatest k ≤ 1000 such that 7 divides binomial(1000, k).

2. The ground truth answer is 979.

3. The proposed answer is 994.

To determine if these are equivalent, we need to understand the mathematical properties:

- The binomial coefficients C(1000, k) are symmetric (C(1000,k) = C(1000,1000-k)), but divisibility by 7 isn't necessarily symmetric.
- The largest k where 7 divides C(1000,k) would be near the extremes of the distribution (very small or very large k), but not at the exact maximum (k=1000) since C(1000,1000)=1 isn't divisible by 7.
- The ground truth 979 comes from analyzing the p-adic valuation (specifically the 7-adic valuation) of C(1000,k).
- 994 is too close to 1000 - C(1000,994) would be equal to C(1000,6), which is 1000*999*998*997*996*995/720, and this is unlikely to be divisible by 7.

The proposed answer (994) is incorrect compared to the ground truth (979). They are not equivalent.
