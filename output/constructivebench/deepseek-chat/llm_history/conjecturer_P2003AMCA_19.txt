Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 73, which is at "x ^ 2 + (2 * c - 50 " in "abbrev P2003AMCA_19_answer : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ := fun a b c _ => 2 * a * x ^ 2 + (2 * c - 50 * a)", there is an error: unknown identifier 'x'.

Looking at the problem statement and error message, I notice:
1. The function needs to take 4 ℝ arguments (a,b,c,x) but current proposal only takes 3
2. The error shows 'x' is undefined because it's not in the parameter list
3. The problem involves combining two quadratic functions f and g centered at x=5 and x=-5
4. When adding f(x) + g(x), the linear terms cancel out, leaving only quadratic and constant terms

Based on the pattern of combining quadratics and the error fix needed, here's the corrected answer:

<<<fun a b c x => 2 * a * x ^ 2 + (2 * c - 50 * a)>>>

Explanation:
1. Added 'x' as fourth parameter to match expected type ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
2. The form comes from expanding (f+g)(x) = a[(x-5)² - (x+5)²] + b[(x-5) - (x+5)] + 2c
3. The (x-5)² - (x+5)² term simplifies to -20x (but this cancels with other terms)
4. The final simplified form is quadratic in x with no linear term, as the b terms cancel out
5. The constant term combines contributions from both functions' constants and the squared terms
