Looking at the problem, we need to find the difference between the supremum and infimum of radii r where there exists a complex number b with |b| = r such that applying the function f(a,b) four times is the identity function.

The key observations:
1. The function f(a,b) is likely a Möbius transformation since we're dealing with complex numbers and fixed points
2. For a Möbius transformation to have order 4 (applying it 4 times gives identity), its matrix representation must satisfy M^4 = I
3. With |a| = 1, the condition suggests roots of unity are involved
4. The enumerated answer suggests a simple radical expression involving √2

The error in the original code is that 'f' is undefined. The correct answer should be based on the geometric properties of the problem rather than trying to define f.

For Möbius transformations with order 4, the fixed points typically involve distances related to 1/√2 from the origin when normalized.

<<<1 / Real.sqrt 2>>> 

This matches the enumerated answer and makes geometric sense for a problem involving fourth roots of unity and complex transformations with |a|=1. The value 1/√2 appears naturally in problems involving 45-degree angles and circles in complex plane.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
