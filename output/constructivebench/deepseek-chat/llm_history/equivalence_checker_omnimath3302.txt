Ground Truth Answer: fun n k => n > k ∧ k ≥ 2
Proposed Answer: fun n k => k ≥ 2 * n - 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem appears to be about a card game where we have 2n cards with n pairs (each pair has two identical numbers from 1 to n). We need to determine when a certain strategy exists to guarantee finding a matching pair.

2. The ground truth answer states that the condition is when n > k and k ≥ 2. This makes sense because:
   - k ≥ 2 ensures we can select at least 2 cards
   - n > k means there are more pairs than our selection capacity, guaranteeing at least one pair will be in our selection

3. The proposed answer states k ≥ 2n - 1, which is completely different:
   - This would require k to be very large compared to n
   - It doesn't match the logical requirements of the problem
   - It doesn't ensure we'll find a matching pair in the described scenario

The two answers are not equivalent, and the proposed answer is incorrect.
