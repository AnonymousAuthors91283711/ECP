Ground Truth Answer: 112
Proposed Answer: 62
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves logarithmic terms with exponents of a and b, and establishes a relationship between consecutive terms in what appears to be an arithmetic sequence.

2. The key is to recognize that the condition term2 - term1 = term3 - term2 implies we have an arithmetic sequence in the logarithms, which corresponds to a geometric sequence in the original terms.

3. Calculating the differences:
   - term1 = 3log(a) + 7log(b)
   - term2 = 5log(a) + 12log(b)
   - term3 = 8log(a) + 15log(b)
   - d = term2 - term1 = 2log(a) + 5log(b)
   - The condition gives us that 3log(a) + 3log(b) = 2log(a) + 5log(b) ⇒ log(a) = 2log(b) ⇒ a = b²

4. Substituting a = b² into the sequence:
   - term1 = 13log(b)
   - d = 9log(b)
   - seq 12 = term1 + 11d = 13log(b) + 99log(b) = 112log(b) = log(b¹¹²)

5. Therefore, the correct exponent is 112, not 62. The proposed answer of 62 is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
