The error occurs because the proposed answer uses `T` as a variable, but `T` is not defined in the scope of the abbreviation. Since the problem statement provides `hT : T = 32`, we should substitute this value into the expression.

Looking at the pattern:
1. The denominator involves `sqrt(1 - (64/T^2))` which simplifies to `sqrt(1 - (64/1024)) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4` when T=32
2. The numerator is 8
3. The expression becomes `8 / (1 - sqrt(15)/4) = 32 / (4 - sqrt(15))`

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<32 / (4 - sqrt 15)>>>

Explanation:
The original expression was parameterized by T, but since T is fixed to 32 in the theorem statement, we substitute this value to get a concrete real number. The simplification follows from basic algebraic manipulation and square root properties. The final form matches the pattern seen in the enumerated answers and satisfies the type requirement of ℝ.
