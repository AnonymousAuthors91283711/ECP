theorem P2002AMCB_6 (a b : ℝ) (ha : a ≠ 0) (hb : b ≠ 0) :
  (eval a (X^2 + C a * X + C b) = 0 ∧ eval b (X^2 + C a * X + C b) = 0) ↔ (a, b) ∈ P2002AMCB_6_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(1, -2)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b) | (a = 1 ∧ b = -2) ∨ (a = -2 ∧ b = -2)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all pairs (a,b) where a≠0 and b≠0 such that both a and b are roots of the polynomial x² + a x + b.

2. Ground Truth Answer gives only one solution: (1, -2).

3. Proposed Answer gives two solutions: (1, -2) and (-2, -2).

Now let's verify the proposed solutions:
- For (1, -2): The polynomial is x² + x - 2, which has roots 1 and -2. This is correct.
- For (-2, -2): The polynomial is x² - 2x - 2, which has roots 1±√3, not -2. This is incorrect.

The proposed answer includes one correct solution and one incorrect solution. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
