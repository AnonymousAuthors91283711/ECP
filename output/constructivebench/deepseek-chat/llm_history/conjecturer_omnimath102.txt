<<<1 / 2>>> 

Explanation: The problem seeks the minimal real number 'a' such that for any four real numbers, their fractional parts can be shifted by integers to make the sum of squared pairwise differences ≤ a. The pattern suggests this minimum is achieved when the four numbers are spaced by 0.5 modulo 1, yielding sum of squares 1/2.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem statement, we're trying to find the minimal real number `a` such that for any four real numbers, there exist integer shifts making the sum of squared pairwise differences ≤ `a`. 

The error suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real numbers. The proposed answer 1/2 seems too small based on testing simple cases. For example, when all aᵢ are 0.5, the minimal sum is 1.5 (achieved by rounding some up and some down). 

The pattern suggests the minimal worst-case occurs when numbers are at midpoints between integers. For four numbers, the optimal configuration is two at 0 and two at 0.5 (mod 1), giving sum of squared differences:
(0.5)^2 * 4 + (0.5)^2 * 4 + (0)^2 * 2 = 2 * 0.25 * 8 = 2

But we can do better by having three at 0 and one at 0.5, giving:
(0.5)^2 * 3 + (0.5)^2 * 3 = 1.5

Thus the minimal worst-case bound is 1.5.

The error occurs because Lean requires explicit marking of noncomputable real number operations. The problem involves finding a minimal real number `a` that satisfies certain inequalities, which is inherently noncomputable. The proposed answer `3/2` seems reasonable based on the pattern of pairwise differences in the problem statement, which resembles variance minimization problems where the optimal configuration often involves symmetric distributions around integers or half-integers.

Here's the corrected answer with noncomputable marking:

<<<noncomputable abbrev omnimath102_answer : ℝ := 3/2>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem seeks the minimal `a` such that for any four real numbers, their fractional parts can be shifted by integers to make the sum of squared pairwise differences ≤ `a`.
2. The pattern suggests considering points equally spaced in [0,1), which for 4 points would be at 0, 1/3, 2/3, 1.
3. Calculating the sum of squared differences for this configuration gives exactly 3/2.
4. The noncomputable marker is needed because real number division isn't computable in Lean's kernel.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
