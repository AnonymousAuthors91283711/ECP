Ground Truth Answer: {⟨2 ^ k, 2 ^ k⟩ | k ≥ 0} ∪ {⟨2 * 3 ^ k, 3 ^ k⟩ | k ≥ 0} ∪ {⟨3 ^ k, 2 * 3 ^ k⟩ | k ≥ 0}
Proposed Answer: {xy : ℕ × ℕ | ∃ k > 0, xy = (k, k)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for all pairs of positive integers (x,y) where for any two coprime divisors a,b of x³ + y³, we have a + b - 1 also divides x³ + y³.

2. The ground truth answer gives three families of solutions:
   - Pairs where both numbers are equal powers of 2
   - Pairs where one number is twice a power of 3 and the other is a power of 3
   - The reverse of the above case

3. The proposed answer only includes pairs where both numbers are equal (for any k > 0), which would only cover the first case of the ground truth (and even then, only when k is a power of 2).

The proposed answer is missing:
- The cases involving powers of 3
- The restriction that equal pairs must be powers of 2 (it allows any equal numbers)
- The asymmetric cases
