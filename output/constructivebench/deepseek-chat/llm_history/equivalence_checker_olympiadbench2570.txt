Ground Truth Answer: {(27, 20, 13), (18, 20, 22)}
Proposed Answer: {(2, 20, 38), (8, 20, 32), (20, 20, 20)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us three conditions:
   - b - a = c - b (arithmetic progression)
   - a + b + c = 60
   - There exists r such that (a-2)*r = b and b*r = c+3

2. Ground truth answer provides two solutions: (27,20,13) and (18,20,22)

3. Proposed answer provides three different solutions: (2,20,38), (8,20,32), (20,20,20)

Let's check if the proposed solutions satisfy all conditions:

For (2,20,38):
- b-a=18, c-b=18 ✔
- Sum=60 ✔
- But (a-2)*r=0*r=20 has no solution (r would be undefined) ✗

For (8,20,32):
- b-a=12, c-b=12 ✔
- Sum=60 ✔
- (8-2)*r=20 ⇒ r=10/3, but 20*(10/3)≠35 ✗

For (20,20,20):
- b-a=0, c-b=0 ✔
- Sum=60 ✔
- (20-2)*r=20 ⇒ r=10/9, but 20*(10/9)≠23 ✗

None of the proposed solutions satisfy all conditions, while the ground truth solutions do. Therefore:

<<<False>>>
