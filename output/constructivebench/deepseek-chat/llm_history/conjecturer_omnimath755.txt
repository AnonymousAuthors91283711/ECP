The error occurs because the proposed answer tries to use variables `a`, `b`, and `c` which are not in scope when defining `omnimath755_answer`. Since the answer should be a set of real numbers independent of specific `a`, `b`, `c` values, we need to find a closed-form expression.

From the problem constraints:
1. `a + b + c = 100`
2. `ab + bc + ca = 20`
3. `(a+b)(a+c) = 24`

We can derive that `bc` must satisfy certain conditions. Expanding (a+b)(a+c) gives:
`a² + ab + ac + bc = 24`
But from h₂, `ab + ac = 20 - bc`, so:
`a² + (20 - bc) + bc = 24` → `a² = 4`

Thus a = ±2. Similarly for b and c. The enumerated answers show that bc can be either 40 - 100*2 + 4 = -156 or 40 - 100*(-2) + 4 = 244. Therefore, the solution set should contain these two values.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<{ -156, 244 }>>>

Explanation: The solution comes from solving for bc when a is either 2 or -2 (and similarly for b and c). The constraints lead to these two possible values for bc, regardless of which variable is assigned ±2. The set contains both possibilities since any permutation of (a,b,c) values will result in bc being one of these two values.
