Ground Truth Answer: 738826
Proposed Answer: 362893
Let's evaluate the proposed answer against the ground truth by computing the left-hand side of the equation:

1. Calculate each term:
   - 8 * (9!) / (2*2) = 8*362880/4 = 725760
   - 4 * (7!) / 2 = 4*5040/2 = 10080
   - 4 * (6!) = 4*720 = 2880
   - 4 * (4!) = 4*24 = 96
   - (3!) = 6
   - (2!) = 2
   - (2!) = 2

2. Sum all terms:
   725760 + 10080 = 735840
   735840 + 2880 = 738720
   738720 + 96 = 738816
   738816 + 6 = 738822
   738822 + 2 = 738824
   738824 + 2 = 738826

The correct sum is 738826, which matches the ground truth. The proposed answer 362893 is incorrect.
