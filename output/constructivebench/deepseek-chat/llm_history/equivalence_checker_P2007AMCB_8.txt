Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 3 / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us:
   - T and N are natural numbers with 0 < N < T
   - c₁ + c₂ + c₃ = T
   - T - N = 2*((c₁ - N) + (c₂ - N) + (c₃ - N))

2. Let's simplify the second equation:
   T - N = 2*(c₁ + c₂ + c₃ - 3N)
   But c₁ + c₂ + c₃ = T, so:
   T - N = 2*(T - 3N)
   T - N = 2T - 6N
   -T = -5N
   T = 5N

3. Therefore, T/N = 5N/N = 5

Wait, this contradicts both the ground truth (3) and proposed answer (3/2). However, the ground truth is marked as 3, which appears to be incorrect based on this derivation. The proposed answer of 3/2 is also incorrect.

Given that both answers are incorrect but in different ways, and neither matches the correct derivation, they are not equivalent to each other.
