Ground Truth Answer: 2/5
Proposed Answer: 1 / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. First, let's understand the problem:
   - Set A = {1,2,3,4,5} (5 elements)
   - Set B = {6,7,8} (3 elements)
   - Ω = A × B has 5 × 3 = 15 elements
   - We need to count pairs (a,b) where a^b is even

2. For a^b to be even, a must be even (since even^any = even, odd^any = odd)
   - Even numbers in A: {2,4} (2 elements)
   - For each even a, all b in B work
   - So valid pairs: 2 (even a's) × 3 (b's) = 6 pairs

3. Probability = 6/15 = 2/5 (ground truth)

4. Proposed answer is 1/2, which would be 7.5/15, but we can't have half pairs

The proposed answer (1/2) doesn't match the correct probability (2/5).
