Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to count integer pairs (p₁, p₂) where:
   - p₁ ∈ {-1, 0, 1} (from Finset.Icc (-1) 1)
   - p₂ ∈ {0, 1, 2} (from Finset.Icc 0 2)
   - p₁²⁰²⁰ + (p₂ - 1)² = 1

2. Since p₁ ∈ {-1, 0, 1}, p₁²⁰²⁰ is always equal to p₁² (because (-1)^2020 = 1, 0^2020 = 0, 1^2020 = 1)

3. So the equation simplifies to p₁² + (p₂ - 1)² = 1

4. Let's enumerate all possible pairs:
   - (0,0): 0 + 1 = 1 → valid
   - (0,2): 0 + 1 = 1 → valid
   - (1,1): 1 + 0 = 1 → valid
   - (-1,1): 1 + 0 = 1 → valid
   - Other combinations don't satisfy the equation

5. The ground truth answer correctly identifies 4 valid pairs. The proposed answer of 5 is incorrect as it counts one extra invalid pair.
