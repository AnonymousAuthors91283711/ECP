Ground Truth Answer: fun n => if n = 0 then 1 else 
    (n.factorization).prod fun p α => p^(p^α - 1)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n^(n - 1)
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The ground truth answer handles the case n=0 specially (returns 1), while the proposed answer would return 0^(0-1) which is undefined (0^0 is controversial, but 0^-1 is definitely undefined).

2. For n=1:
- Ground truth: 1^(1^1 - 1) = 1^0 = 1
- Proposed: 1^(1-1) = 1^0 = 1
Same result

3. For prime p:
- Ground truth: p^(p^1 - 1) = p^(p-1)
- Proposed: p^(p-1)
Same result

4. For n=4 (composite):
- Ground truth: 2^(2^2 - 1) = 2^(4-1) = 8
- Proposed: 4^(4-1) = 64
Different results

5. For n=6 (composite):
- Ground truth: 2^(2^1 - 1) * 3^(3^1 - 1) = 2^1 * 3^2 = 18
- Proposed: 6^5 = 7776
Very different

The answers only match for n=0 (special case) and prime numbers, but diverge for composite numbers. Therefore:

<<<False>>>
