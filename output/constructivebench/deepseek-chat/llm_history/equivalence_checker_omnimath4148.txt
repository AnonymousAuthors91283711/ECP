Ground Truth Answer: 2016 / 2017 ^ 2
Proposed Answer: 1 / 2018
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a recursive sequence aₙ with initial conditions a₀=0, a₁=1, and a recursive relation for n≥2 involving averages of previous terms.

2. The question asks for the greatest possible value of a₂₀₁₈ - a₂₀₁₇.

3. The ground truth answer is 2016/2017² ≈ 0.000496 (very small positive number)

4. The proposed answer is 1/2018 ≈ 0.0004956 (also very small positive number, but slightly different)

While both answers are small positive numbers, they are mathematically distinct:
- 2016/2017² ≈ 0.000496
- 1/2018 ≈ 0.0004956

The difference might seem small, but in mathematical proofs, exact values matter. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth answer's exact form.
