<<<{x | ∃ k : ℝ, x = 60 * k - k^2} ∪ {x | ∃ k : ℝ, x = 60 * k + k^2}>>> 

Explanation: The problem describes a right triangle in arithmetic progression with one side equal to 60. The enumerated solutions suggest two families of solutions based on whether 60 is the smallest, middle, or largest term. The answer captures both cases where the area can be expressed as either 60k - k² or 60k + k² for some real k.
