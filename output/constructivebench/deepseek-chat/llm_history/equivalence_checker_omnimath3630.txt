Ground Truth Answer: {1, 2, 3, 5}
Proposed Answer: {1, 3, 7, 9}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

The problem asks for a set of 4 natural numbers where:
1. The set has exactly 4 elements (which both answers satisfy)
2. For any permutation {a,b,c,d} of the set, all three expressions (a*b + c*d, a*c + b*d, a*d + b*c) must be prime numbers

Let's test the ground truth {1,2,3,5}:
- 1*2 + 3*5 = 17 (prime)
- 1*3 + 2*5 = 13 (prime)
- 1*5 + 2*3 = 11 (prime)
All combinations work.

Now test the proposed {1,3,7,9}:
- 1*3 + 7*9 = 66 (not prime)
- 1*7 + 3*9 = 34 (not prime)
- 1*9 + 3*7 = 30 (not prime)
These fail the prime condition.

<<<False>>>
