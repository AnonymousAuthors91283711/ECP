Ground Truth Answer: 80
Proposed Answer: 40
Let me analyze the problem and the answers.

The problem is asking to find two real numbers r and s such that:
1. For all m, the quadratic equation x² = 14 + m(x - 20) has no real solutions if and only if r < m < s
2. The sum r + s equals some value (P2014AMCB_17_answer)

First, let's analyze the quadratic equation:
x² = 14 + m(x - 20) can be rewritten as:
x² - mx + (20m - 14) = 0

For this quadratic to have no real solutions, the discriminant must be negative:
D = m² - 4(20m - 14) < 0
=> m² - 80m + 56 < 0

The roots of m² - 80m + 56 = 0 are:
m = [80 ± √(6400 - 224)]/2 = [80 ± √6176]/2 ≈ [80 ± 78.59]/2
So r ≈ 0.705 and s ≈ 79.295

Thus r + s ≈ 80, which matches the ground truth answer.

The proposed answer of 40 is clearly incorrect as it's only half of the correct sum.
