abbrev omnimath578_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath578 (n : ℕ) :
  (digits 10 (∏ i in Finset.range (n + 1), (10^(2^i) - 1))).sum = omnimath578_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Looking at the pattern of digits sum for n=0,1,2,3:
n=0: 9 → 9
n=1: 9*99 → 9+9+9 = 27
n=2: 9*99*9999 → 9+9+9+9+9+9 = 54
n=3: 9*99*9999*99999999 → 108
The pattern suggests 9*(n+1)*2^n.

<<<fun n : ℕ => 9 * (n + 1) * 2 ^ n>>>
