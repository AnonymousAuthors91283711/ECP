Ground Truth Answer: (35, 90)
Proposed Answer: (3, 6)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find the greatest pair (p₁, p₂) where:
   - 1 ≤ p₁ ≤ p₂ ≤ 100
   - There exists a natural number k such that (p₁ + p₂)(p₁ + p₂ + 1) = k*p₁*p₂

2. The ground truth answer is (35, 90). Let's verify it:
   - Sum: 35 + 90 = 125
   - Equation: 125 * 126 = 15750
   - 15750 / (35 * 90) = 15750 / 3150 = 5 (which is a natural number k)

3. The proposed answer is (3, 6):
   - Sum: 3 + 6 = 9
   - Equation: 9 * 10 = 90
   - 90 / (3 * 6) = 90 / 18 = 5 (also a natural number k)

While (3,6) satisfies the conditions, it's clearly not the greatest pair in the set (as (35,90) is larger in both components and also satisfies the condition). The problem asks for the greatest such pair.
