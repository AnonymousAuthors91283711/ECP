Ground Truth Answer: fun i j => 
    match i, j with
    | 0, 0 => 10
    | 0, 1 => 11
    | 0, 2 => 12
    | 0, 3 => 13
    | 0, 4 => 14
    | 1, 0 => -2
    | 1, 1 => -1
    | 1, 2 => 0
    | 1, 3 => 1
    | 1, 4 => 2
    | _, _ => 0  -- unreachable case
Proposed Answer: fun i j => if i = 0 then j else 2 * j + 1
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer:
- For i=0: Returns exact values 10,11,12,13,14 for j=0,1,2,3,4 respectively
- For i=1: Returns exact values -2,-1,0,1,2 for j=0,1,2,3,4 respectively
- Clearly satisfies both conditions (strictly increasing and the sum of squares condition)

2. Proposed Answer:
- For i=0: Returns j (0,1,2,3,4) - doesn't match ground truth
- For i=1: Returns 2j+1 (1,3,5,7,9) - doesn't match ground truth
- While it's strictly increasing, it fails the sum of squares condition (e.g. for i=0: 0²+1²+2²=5 ≠ 3²+4²=25)

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth in any way and fails to satisfy the problem's conditions.
