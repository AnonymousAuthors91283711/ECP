Looking at the problem, we need to find the sum of a geometric series given two conditions. The errors occur because the proposed answer uses 'r' which isn't in scope for the abbreviation. The answer should be a constant real number, not dependent on r or a.

From the given conditions:
1. First sum (2011 terms) = 200 = a(1-r²⁰¹¹)/(1-r)
2. Second sum (4022 terms) = 380 = a(1-r⁴⁰²²)/(1-r)

Taking the ratio of second to first sum:
380/200 = (1-r⁴⁰²²)/(1-r²⁰¹¹) = 1 + r²⁰¹¹
Thus r²⁰¹¹ = 380/200 - 1 = 0.9

Now for the desired sum (6033 terms):
Sum = a(1-r⁶⁰³³)/(1-r) = [a(1-r²⁰¹¹)/(1-r)] * (1 + r²⁰¹¹ + r⁴⁰²²)
= 200 * (1 + 0.9 + 0.9²) = 200 * (1 + 0.9 + 0.81) = 200 * 2.71 = 542
