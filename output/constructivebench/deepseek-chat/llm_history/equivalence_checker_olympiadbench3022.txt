Ground Truth Answer: 11
Proposed Answer: 8
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

The problem is a logarithmic equation:
log₆(√(x-7)) + log₃₆(x-2) = 1

To solve this:
1. The second term can be rewritten using change of base formula: log₃₆(x-2) = (1/2)log₆(x-2)
2. The equation becomes: (1/2)log₆(x-7) + (1/2)log₆(x-2) = 1
3. Multiply both sides by 2: log₆(x-7) + log₆(x-2) = 2
4. Combine logs: log₆[(x-7)(x-2)] = 2
5. Convert to exponential form: (x-7)(x-2) = 6² = 36
6. Expand and solve the quadratic equation: x² -9x +14 =36 → x²-9x-22=0
7. Solutions: x = [9 ± √(81+88)]/2 = [9 ± √169]/2 = [9 ± 13]/2 → x=11 or x=-2

Now check the domain:
- √(x-7) requires x ≥ 7
- log₆(x-2) requires x > 2
Thus x=11 is valid, but x=-2 is invalid.

The ground truth answer is 11, while the proposed answer is 8.

Checking x=8:
(8-7)(8-2) = 1*6 = 6 ≠ 36, so it doesn't satisfy the equation.
