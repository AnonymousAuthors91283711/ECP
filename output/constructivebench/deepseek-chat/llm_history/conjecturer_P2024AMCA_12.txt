From the problem statement and enumerated answers, we're looking for the minimal digit sum of a*r² where:
1. a < 720
2. 720 < a*r²
3. 720 = a*r

The key insight is that r must be a divisor of 720 since a = 720/r. Testing divisors r of 720 gives minimal digit sum when r=4 (a=180), yielding a*r²=2880 with digit sum 18.
