Ground Truth Answer: 112
Proposed Answer: 8
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence modulo 11 and asks for the product of three specific terms (2018, 2020, 2022).

2. The ground truth answer is 112.

3. The proposed answer is 8.

4. Since we're working modulo 11, we should consider whether 112 ≡ 8 mod 11:
   - 112 ÷ 11 = 10 with remainder 2 (since 11×10=110, 112-110=2)
   - So 112 mod 11 = 2
   - 8 mod 11 = 8
   - 2 ≠ 8

5. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
