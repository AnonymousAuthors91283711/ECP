Explanation: The problem involves finding the minimal degree of a polynomial that distinguishes between collinear points and points on a unit circle. The enumerated pattern suggests the answer is linear in n, and the simplest linear function matching the examples is 2n. This corresponds to the degree needed to capture the circle's trigonometric relations.
