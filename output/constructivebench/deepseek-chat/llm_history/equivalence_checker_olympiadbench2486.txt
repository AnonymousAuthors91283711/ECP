Ground Truth Answer: {0, -1, -3/2}
Proposed Answer: {x | x > -9/5 ∧ x ≠ -4/5 ∧ x > -3 ∧ x ≠ -2}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves a logarithmic equation with multiple constraints:
   - Arguments of logarithms must be positive and ≠1
   - Bases must be positive and ≠1
   - The equation must hold

2. Ground Truth Answer gives specific solutions: {0, -1, -3/2}

3. Proposed Answer gives a domain description: {x | x > -9/5 ∧ x ≠ -4/5 ∧ x > -3 ∧ x ≠ -2}

The proposed answer only describes the domain where the equation might have solutions (by specifying where all logarithmic expressions are defined), but it doesn't actually solve for the specific x values that satisfy the equation. The ground truth provides the actual solutions within this domain.

Therefore, these answers are not equivalent - one describes the domain, the other gives specific solutions.
