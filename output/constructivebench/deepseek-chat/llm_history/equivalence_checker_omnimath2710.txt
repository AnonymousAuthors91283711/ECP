Ground Truth Answer: -150
Proposed Answer: -540
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have two equations:
   - (x - y)/(x + y) = 9
   - (x * y)/(x + y) = -60

2. The expression to evaluate is: (x + y) + (x - y) + x * y

3. From the first equation: (x - y) = 9(x + y)
4. From the second equation: (x * y) = -60(x + y)

5. Substitute into the expression:
   (x + y) + 9(x + y) + (-60)(x + y) = (1 + 9 - 60)(x + y) = -50(x + y)

6. Now we need to find (x + y). From the first equation, we can express x in terms of y or vice versa, but we don't actually need the individual values.

7. The ground truth answer is -150, which would imply (x + y) = 3 (since -50 * 3 = -150)

8. The proposed answer is -540, which would imply (x + y) = 10.8

9. However, if we check consistency with the second equation, using (x + y) = 3 leads to x*y = -180, which is consistent with the first equation's result (x - y = 27). The proposed answer's implied value doesn't maintain this consistency.
