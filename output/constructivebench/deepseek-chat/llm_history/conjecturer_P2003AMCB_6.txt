  a = P2003AMCB_6_answer ∨ a = 2 * sqrt 3 / 3 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the given equations:
1. a*r = 2
2. a*r³ = 6

Dividing equation 2 by equation 1 gives r² = 3, so r = ±√3. Substituting back into equation 1 gives two possible values for a.

<<<2 * sqrt 3 / 3>>>
