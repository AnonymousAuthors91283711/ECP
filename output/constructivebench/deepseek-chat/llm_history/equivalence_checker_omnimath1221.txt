Ground Truth Answer: 9954
Proposed Answer: 2197
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding a 4-digit number EVIL where:
   - No digit is zero
   - EVIL is divisible by 73
   - VILE is divisible by 74
   - We need to find the value of LIVE

2. The ground truth answer is 9954, which would correspond to:
   - EVIL = 5499 (5499 ÷ 73 = 75.328... not integer)
   - VILE = 4995 (4995 ÷ 74 = 67.5 not integer)
   Wait, this doesn't satisfy the conditions. Maybe I made a digit ordering mistake.

3. The proposed answer is 2197, which would correspond to:
   - EVIL = 7219 (7219 ÷ 73 ≈ 98.89 not integer)
   - VILE = 2197 (2197 ÷ 74 ≈ 29.69 not integer)
   This also doesn't satisfy the conditions.

Wait, let's re-examine the digit ordering:
- EVIL = 1000E + 100V + 10I + L
- VILE = 1000V + 100I + 10L + E
- LIVE = 1000L + 100I + 10V + E

The correct solution should be:
- EVIL = 1971 (1971 ÷ 73 = 27)
- VILE = 9711 (9711 ÷ 74 ≈ 131.23) → Doesn't work
This isn't matching either.

Given that neither answer satisfies both divisibility conditions, and they don't match each other in any meaningful way, the proposed answer is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
