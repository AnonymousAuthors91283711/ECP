From the problem statement, we need to find a real number `omnimath3057_answer` such that for a linear function `f(x) = a*x + b` satisfying `f(b*x + a) = x` for all `x`, we have `a + b = omnimath3057_answer`. 

The condition `f(b*x + a) = x` implies:
1. `f` is invertible (since it's bijective)
2. Substituting `f` gives `a*(b*x + a) + b = x`
3. This must hold for all `x`, so we get two equations:
   - `a*b = 1` (coefficient of x)
   - `a² + b = 0` (constant term)

Solving these:
- From `a*b = 1`, `b = 1/a`
- Substituting into `a² + b = 0` gives `a² + 1/a = 0` → `a³ + 1 = 0` → `a = -1`
- Then `b = 1/-1 = -1`
- Thus `a + b = -2`
