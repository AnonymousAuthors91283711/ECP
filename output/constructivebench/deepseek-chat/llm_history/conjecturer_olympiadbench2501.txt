The error occurs because we need to use `Real.pi` instead of just `π` in Lean. Also, looking at the function f(x) = sin⁶x + cos⁶x - 0.7(sin⁴x + cos⁴x), we can simplify it using trigonometric identities. The enumerated answers suggest solutions at odd multiples of π/4, but we need to generalize this pattern.

The simplified form of f(x) shows it's equivalent to 1 - 3sin²xcos²x - 0.7(1 - 2sin²xcos²x) = 0.3 - 1.6sin²xcos²x. Setting this to zero gives sin²xcos²x = 0.3/1.6 = 3/16, which occurs when sin(2x) = ±√3/2. This happens at x = π/6 + kπ/2 and x = π/3 + kπ/2 for any integer k.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<{x | ∃ k : ℤ, x = k * Real.pi / 2 + Real.pi / 6 ∨ x = k * Real.pi / 2 + Real.pi / 3}>>>
