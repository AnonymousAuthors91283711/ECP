Ground Truth Answer: {(1, [1]), (3, [2, 3, 6]), (4, [4, 4, 4, 4])}
Proposed Answer: {(1, [1])} ∪ {(n, List.replicate n 5) | n > 1}
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is asking for all pairs (n, ks) where:
1. n > 0
2. ks has length n
3. Sum of ks is 5n - 4
4. Sum of reciprocals of ks is 1

Let's check the ground truth:
- (1,[1]): sum=1=5*1-4, reciprocal sum=1/1=1 ✔
- (3,[2,3,6]): sum=11=5*3-4, reciprocal sum=1/2+1/3+1/6=1 ✔
- (4,[4,4,4,4]): sum=16=5*4-4, reciprocal sum=4*(1/4)=1 ✔

Now the proposed answer:
- (1,[1]) is correct ✔
- For n>1, it suggests (n, [5,5,...,5]):
  Sum would be 5n ≠ 5n-4 ✖ (fails condition 3)
  Reciprocal sum would be n*(1/5) ≠ 1 ✖ (fails condition 4)

The proposed answer is completely wrong for n>1 cases, only getting the n=1 case right.
