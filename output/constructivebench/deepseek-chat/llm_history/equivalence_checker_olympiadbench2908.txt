theorem olympiadbench2908 : 
  2^(log 800 / log 4) / 2^(log 64 / log 16) = olympiadbench2908_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 10
Proposed Answer: 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves simplifying the expression: 2^(log 800 / log 4) / 2^(log 64 / log 16)

2. Using logarithm properties:
   - log 800 / log 4 = log₄ 800
   - log 64 / log 16 = log₁₆ 64
   - The expression becomes 2^(log₄ 800) / 2^(log₁₆ 64)

3. Simplifying further:
   - 2^(log₄ 800) = (4^(1/2))^(log₄ 800) = 4^(1/2 log₄ 800) = 4^(log₄ √800) = √800
   - 2^(log₁₆ 64) = (16^(1/4))^(log₁₆ 64) = 16^(1/4 log₁₆ 64) = 16^(log₁₆ 64^(1/4)) = 64^(1/4) = (4^3)^(1/4) = 4^(3/4)

4. Final simplification:
   √800 / 4^(3/4) = (800^(1/2)) / (4^3)^(1/4) = (800^(1/2)) / (64^(1/4)) ≈ 28.284 / 2.828 ≈ 10

The ground truth answer is 10, while the proposed answer is 5. The calculations clearly show the correct answer is 10, not 5.
