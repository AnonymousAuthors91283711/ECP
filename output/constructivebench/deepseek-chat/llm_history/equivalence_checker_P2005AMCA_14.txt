  (odd_configs : ℚ) / (total_dots : ℚ) = P2005AMCA_14_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 11/21
Proposed Answer: 1 / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. First, calculate total_dots: 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21
2. For odd_configs, there are two cases shown:
   - First case (1*0 + 2*1 + 3*0 + 4*1 + 5*0 + 6*1) = 0+2+0+4+0+6 = 12
   - Second case (1*1 + 2*0 + 3*1 + 4*0 + 5*1 + 6*0) = 1+0+3+0+5+0 = 9
   - Total odd_configs = 12 + 9 = 21

3. The probability would be odd_configs/total_dots = 21/21 = 1

However, the ground truth answer is 11/21, which suggests the odd_configs calculation might be different. The proposed answer is 1/2, which doesn't match either the straightforward calculation or the ground truth.
