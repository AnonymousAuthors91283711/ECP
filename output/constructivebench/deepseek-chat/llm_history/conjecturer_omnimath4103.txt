Current Proposed Answer: {P | ∃ k : ℝ, P = Polynomial.C k * (X^2 + 1)}. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 87, which is at "X^2 + 1)}" in "abbrev omnimath4103_answer : Set (Polynomial ℝ) := {P | ∃ k : ℝ, P = Polynomial.C k * (X^2 + 1)}", there is an error: unknown identifier 'X'.
. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (Polynomial ℝ)
The error occurs because `X` needs to be properly qualified as `Polynomial.X` in Lean's mathlib. The proposed answer suggests that the solution set consists of all real polynomial multiples of (x² + 1). This makes sense because:

1. The condition involves cyclic sums of evaluations at (a-b), (b-c), (c-a) and (a+b+c)
2. The polynomial x² + 1 is symmetric and handles the given condition well
3. The enumerated answers (though not shown) likely follow this pattern
4. The condition holds when scaled by any real constant k

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<{P | ∃ k : ℝ, P = Polynomial.C k * (Polynomial.X^2 + 1)}>>>

The fix replaces `X` with `Polynomial.X` to properly reference the polynomial variable in mathlib. The structure remains the same - all real scalar multiples of x² + 1. This forms a vector space of solutions satisfying the given functional equation.
