The error occurs because the proposed answer uses incorrect syntax for Lean. In Lean, we should use standard parentheses `()` instead of angle brackets `⟨⟩` for pairs, and we don't need the `<<< >>>` delimiters inside the actual code.

Looking at the problem, we need to find a unique pair (x,y) of positive integers satisfying 19x + 17y = 201. The enumerated answer suggests (8,7) is a solution, which we can verify:
19*8 + 17*7 = 152 + 119 = 271 ≠ 201 (this doesn't work, so the enumerated answer must be incorrect)

Let's find the correct solution:
We can solve 19x + 17y = 201 for positive integers x,y.
Rearranging: y = (201 - 19x)/17
We need 201 - 19x to be divisible by 17 and positive.

Testing x values:
x=2: y=(201-38)/17=163/17≈9.58 (not integer)
x=3: y=(201-57)/17=144/17≈8.47
x=4: y=(201-76)/17=125/17≈7.35
x=5: y=(201-95)/17=106/17≈6.23
x=6: y=(201-114)/17=87/17≈5.12
x=7: y=(201-133)/17=68/17=4 (integer!)

Verification: 19*7 + 17*4 = 133 + 68 = 201

Thus, the correct answer is (7,4).

Looking at the problem statement, we need to find a unique pair of natural numbers (x,y) that satisfies the equation 19x + 17y = 201 with x > 0 and y > 0. 

To find the solution:
1. We can rearrange the equation to y = (201 - 19x)/17
2. We need (201 - 19x) to be divisible by 17 and positive
3. Testing x values from 1 upwards:
   - x=1: 201-19=182, 182/17≈10.7 (not integer)
   - x=2: 201-38=163, 163/17≈9.6 (not integer)
   - x=3: 201-57=144, 144/17≈8.5 (not integer)
   - x=4: 201-76=125, 125/17≈7.4 (not integer)
   - x=5: 201-95=106, 106/17≈6.2 (not integer)
   - x=6: 201-114=87, 87/17≈5.1 (not integer)
   - x=7: 201-133=68, 68/17=4 (integer)

The pair (7,4) satisfies all conditions and is the unique solution.
