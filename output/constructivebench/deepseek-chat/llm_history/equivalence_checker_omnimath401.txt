Ground Truth Answer: fun p => Nat.Prime p ∧ (p = 3 ∨ p % 3 = 1)
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℕ => p % 3 ≠ 2 ∧ (p = 0 ∨ ∃ k : ℕ, p = 3^k ∨ ∃ q r : ℕ, q % 3 ≠ 2 ∧ r % 3 ≠ 2 ∧ p = q * r)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer states that a natural number p can be expressed as x² + 3y² if and only if:
1. p is prime, AND
2. Either p = 3 or p ≡ 1 mod 3

The proposed answer states that p can be expressed as x² + 3y² if and only if:
1. p ≢ 2 mod 3, AND
2. Either p = 0, or p is a power of 3, or p can be factored into numbers q and r where both q ≢ 2 mod 3 and r ≢ 2 mod 3

Key differences:
1. The ground truth restricts to primes only, while the proposed answer allows composites and zero
2. The proposed answer's condition is necessary but not sufficient for the representation
3. The ground truth is more restrictive and precise for primes

For example:
- p=4: Proposed answer would accept it (4 ≡ 1 mod 3), but 4 cannot be expressed as x² + 3y²
- p=9: Proposed answer accepts it (power of 3), but ground truth rejects it (not prime)
- p=25: Proposed answer accepts it (25 ≡ 1 mod 3), but 25 cannot be expressed as x² + 3y²
