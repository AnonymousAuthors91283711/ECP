Ground Truth Answer: 41/2
Proposed Answer: (1 + sqrt(57)) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal possible value of |w³ + z³| given the constraints |w + z| = 1 and |w² + z²| = 14.

2. The ground truth answer is 41/2 = 20.5.

3. The proposed answer is (1 + sqrt(57))/2 ≈ (1 + 7.55)/2 ≈ 4.275.

Comparison:
- The proposed answer is significantly smaller than the ground truth answer.
- The ground truth answer is a rational number (41/2), while the proposed answer involves an irrational component (sqrt(57)).
- The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the condition that it should be the least value under the given constraints, as 4.275 is much smaller than 20.5.

Conclusion: The answers are not equivalent.
