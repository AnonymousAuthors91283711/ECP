Ground Truth Answer: 19 / 34
Proposed Answer: 8 / 15
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find a unique pair of natural numbers (a,b) where:
   - a and b are positive
   - gcd(a,b) = 1 (fraction in simplest form)
   - b - a = 15
   - 5/9 < a/b < 4/7
   - a/b equals some predefined answer

2. Ground truth answer is 19/34:
   - 34 - 19 = 15 ✔
   - gcd(19,34) = 1 ✔
   - 5/9 ≈ 0.555... < 19/34 ≈ 0.5588... < 4/7 ≈ 0.5714 ✔

3. Proposed answer is 8/15:
   - 15 - 8 = 7 ≠ 15 ✖ (fails the b-a=15 condition)
   - While gcd(8,15)=1 and 5/9≈0.555...<8/15≈0.533...<4/7≈0.5714 is false (8/15≈0.533 is actually less than 5/9≈0.555)

The proposed answer fails both the difference condition and the inequality condition.

<<<False>>>
