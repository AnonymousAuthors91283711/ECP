Looking at the problem, we need to find the least positive real number t where sin(πt - π/2) = -1. The sine function equals -1 at (3π/2 + 2πk) for integer k.

Solving πt - π/2 = 3π/2 + 2πk:
πt = 2π + 2πk
t = 2 + 2k

The smallest positive solution occurs when k=0, giving t=2. The proposed answer 3/2 is incorrect as sin(π*(3/2) - π/2) = sin(π) = 0 ≠ -1.

The error message suggests marking it noncomputable since it involves real numbers. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev olympiadbench2236_answer : ℝ := 2>>>

Explanation:
1. The equation sin(πt - π/2) = -1 has general solution t = 2 + 2k for integer k
2. The smallest positive solution is t=2 (k=0)
3. The answer must be marked noncomputable because it involves real numbers
4. The proposed 3/2 was incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the equation
