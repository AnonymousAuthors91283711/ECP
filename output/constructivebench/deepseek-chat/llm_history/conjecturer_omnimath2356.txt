theorem omnimath2356 :
  let rec a : ℕ → ℕ
    | 0 => 0      | 1 => 1
    | n + 1 => (a n + (n + 1)) % 2012
  a 2012 = omnimath2356_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern of `a n % 2012`, it cycles every 2012 steps since 2012 is the modulus. The sequence `a n` is triangular numbers shifted by 1. For n=2012, we compute `triangular(2011) % 2012`. Since 2012=4×503 and 503 is prime, we use triangular number formula and modular arithmetic. The answer is:

<<<1006>>>
