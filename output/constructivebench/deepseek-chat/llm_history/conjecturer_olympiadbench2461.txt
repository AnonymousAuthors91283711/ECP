noncomputable abbrev olympiadbench2461_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2461 (x : ℝ) :
    log (2^(x - 1) + 3^(x + 1)) / log 2 = 2 * x - log (3^x) / log 2 ↔ x = olympiadbench2461_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Looking at the equation structure and the enumerated answer, we can see the solution simplifies the logarithmic equation. The key is to recognize that when x=1, both sides equal 1, and this is the unique solution.
