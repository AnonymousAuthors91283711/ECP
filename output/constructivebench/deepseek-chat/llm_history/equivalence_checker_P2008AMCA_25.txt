Ground Truth Answer: 1 / 2^98
Proposed Answer: (2 + 4) / (2 * (sqrt 3)^99)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

1. First, let's understand the problem: We have a recursive sequence where each term (aₙ₊₁, bₙ₊₁) is a rotation and scaling of (aₙ, bₙ) by angle π/6 and scaling factor 2 (since √3² + 1² = 2).

2. The ground truth answer is 1/2⁹⁸, which comes from:
   - The magnitude scales by 2 each step, so after 99 steps (from n=1 to n=100), the magnitude increases by 2⁹⁹
   - The given (a₁₀₀, b₁₀₀) = (2,4) has magnitude √(2² + 4²) = √20 = 2√5
   - Therefore initial magnitude is 2√5 / 2⁹⁹ = √5 / 2⁹⁸
   - The sum a₁ + b₁ would be √5 / 2⁹⁸ * (cosθ + sinθ) for some θ, but the exact value simplifies to 1/2⁹⁸

3. The proposed answer is (2+4)/(2*(√3)^99):
   - This equals 6/(2*(√3)^99) = 3/(√3)^99
   - This can be rewritten as 3/(3^(49.5)) = 3^(-48.5)
   - Which is different from 2^(-98)

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth answer in form or value (3^(-48.5) vs 2^(-98)), and there's no obvious simplification that would make them equal.
