<<<2020>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks for the greatest difference d where there exists an interval [m,n) containing more multiples of 2021 than 2000. Since 2021 is larger than 2000, we need the smallest interval where 2021's periodicity gives it an advantage. The answer is 2020 because at d=2020, we can have exactly one multiple of 2021 but no multiples of 2000.
