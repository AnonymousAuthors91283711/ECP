Ground Truth Answer: 9
Proposed Answer: 90
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves summing logarithmic terms from x=81 to x=99 of the form log₍₁₀₀₎(1 + 1/x).

2. The ground truth answer is 9, meaning the equation holds when olympiadbench2510_answer = 9.

3. The proposed answer is 90.

Key observations:
- The logarithmic terms can be rewritten using logarithm properties:
  log₍₁₀₀₎(1 + 1/x) = log₍₁₀₀₎((x+1)/x) = log₍₁₀₀₎(x+1) - log₍₁₀₀₎x
- The sum then telescopes to: log₍₁₀₀₎100 - log₍₁₀₀₎81 = 1 - log₍₁₀₀₎81
- The right side is 2*log₍₁₀₀₎(1 + 1/n) for some n
- Solving 1 - log₍₁₀₀₎81 = 2*log₍₁₀₀₎(1 + 1/n) leads to n=9

The proposed answer (90) is exactly 10 times the correct answer (9). This is clearly incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the equation. The correct answer should make the equation hold, and only n=9 does this.
