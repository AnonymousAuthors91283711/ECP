. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
The error occurs because the trigonometric function `sin` isn't imported/available in the current context. We need to use `Real.sin` instead. Also, based on the problem statement about functions tending to infinity, linear functions with positive slope (a > 0) are the simplest case, and adding bounded terms (like sine) doesn't affect the limit behavior.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a b, a > 0 ∧ ∀ x, f x = a * x + b} ∪ {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a b c, a > 0 ∧ c > 0 ∧ ∀ x, f x = a * x + b + c * Real.sin x}>>>

Explanation:
1. The error was fixed by using `Real.sin` instead of `sin`
2. The answer includes two cases:
   - Simple linear functions (a*x + b) with a > 0
   - Linear functions with added sine terms (a*x + b + c*sin x)
3. Both cases satisfy the tendsto condition since the sine term is bounded and doesn't affect the limit behavior when a > 0
4. The union covers both simpler and more complex cases that meet the criteria
