Looking at the problem statement and the error message, we need to find x > 0 such that x^(2*x^6) = 3. Let's solve this:

1. Take natural log of both sides: ln(x^(2x^6)) = ln(3)
2. Simplify using logarithm power rule: 2x^6 * ln(x) = ln(3)
3. Let y = x^6, then the equation becomes: 2y * ln(y^(1/6)) = ln(3)
4. Simplify: (2y/6) * ln(y) = ln(3) → (y/3) * ln(y) = ln(3)
5. Multiply both sides by 3: y * ln(y) = 3ln(3)
6. Notice that y=3 satisfies this equation since 3*ln(3) = 3ln(3)
7. Therefore x^6 = 3 → x = 3^(1/6)

The error in the original proposal was using log division instead of taking the 6th root. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<Real.pow 3 (1/6)>>>

This gives the positive real root of the equation x^(2x^6) = 3. The answer is noncomputable because it involves real number operations, but it's mathematically correct.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem and error message, we need to find a positive real x such that x^(2*x^6) = 3. The proposed answer was using Real.pow which doesn't exist - the correct function is Real.rpow (real power) or simply using the ^ operator.

The equation can be solved by taking natural logs:
1. Take ln of both sides: ln(x^(2x^6)) = ln(3)
2. Simplify using log rules: 2x^6 * ln(x) = ln(3)
3. Let y = x^6, then: 2y * (1/6)ln(y) = ln(3)
4. Simplify: y^(1/3) = 3
5. Solve for y: y = 3^3 = 27
6. Then x = y^(1/6) = 27^(1/6) = 3^(1/2)

The correct answer is the square root of 3. In Lean, we should use either Real.rpow or the ^ operator with proper type annotations.

<<<3 ^ (1/2 : ℝ)>>>

Explanation: The solution involves solving the equation x^(2x^6) = 3 by taking logarithms and performing algebraic manipulations. The final simplified form is x = √3, which in Lean is expressed as 3 raised to the power of 1/2 (with explicit ℝ type annotation to ensure proper real exponentiation). The error in the original proposal was using Real.pow instead of the correct power function for reals.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to find a positive real x such that x^(2*x^6) = 3. The proposed answer 3^(1/2) is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the equation. Let's analyze:

1. Take natural log of both sides: ln(x^(2x^6)) = ln(3)
2. Simplify: 2x^6 * ln(x) = ln(3)
3. Let y = x^6, then: 2y * (1/6)ln(y) = ln(3)
4. Simplify: y*ln(y) = 3ln(3)
5. This suggests y = 3, so x^6 = 3 → x = 3^(1/6)

The error message indicates we need to mark it noncomputable since it involves real number operations. Here's the corrected answer:

Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to find a positive real x such that x^(2*x^6) = 3. Taking natural logs on both sides gives us:
2*x^6*ln(x) = ln(3)

The proposed answer 3^(1/6) is close but not quite correct. Testing x = 3^(1/6):
2*(3^(1/6))^6*ln(3^(1/6)) = 2*3*1/6*ln(3) = ln(3) which satisfies the equation.

The error in Lean is because we need to mark real number operations as noncomputable. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable def omnimath1620_answer : ℝ := 3 ^ (1/6)>>>

Explanation:
1. The equation simplifies to x^6 = 3 when we take the (2x^6)th root of both sides
2. This gives x = 3^(1/6) as the solution
3. The noncomputable annotation is needed because real number exponentiation isn't computable in general in Lean
4. The answer satisfies the original equation since (3^(1/6))^(2*(3^(1/6))^6) = (3^(1/6))^(2*3) = 3^1 = 3
