Ground Truth Answer: 101 * 2 ^ 49 - 50
Proposed Answer: 2^50 * 51 + 2^49
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer:

Ground truth: 101 * 2^49 - 50
Proposed: 2^50 * 51 + 2^49

Let's simplify both expressions:

1. Ground truth:
101 * 2^49 - 50 = (100 + 1)*2^49 - 50 = 100*2^49 + 2^49 - 50

2. Proposed:
2^50 * 51 + 2^49 = (2^1 * 2^49)*51 + 2^49 = 2*51*2^49 + 2^49 = 102*2^49 + 2^49 = (102 + 1)*2^49 = 103*2^49

Now compare:
100*2^49 + 2^49 - 50 = 101*2^49 - 50
vs
103*2^49

These are clearly not equal, as 101*2^49 - 50 ≠ 103*2^49 for any value of 2^49.
