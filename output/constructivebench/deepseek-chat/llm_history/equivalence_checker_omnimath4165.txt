Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 2, 5), (1, 3, 5), (2, 2, 4), (2, 6, 4)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, y, y) | y > 0} ∪ {(2, 2, 2), (2, 2, 4), (2, 4, 2), (2, 4, 8), (2, 8, 4), (2, 8, 10), (2, 10, 8), (3, 3, 3)}
Let's analyze the proposed answer against the ground truth:

1. The ground truth contains specific tuples: (1,2,5), (1,3,5), (2,2,4), (2,6,4)
2. The proposed answer contains:
   - All tuples of form (1,y,y) - this doesn't match any ground truth tuples except (1,2,2) would satisfy the form but isn't in ground truth
   - (2,2,4) is correct and matches ground truth
   - Many other tuples that aren't in ground truth
   - Missing (1,2,5), (1,3,5), and (2,6,4) from ground truth

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It includes many solutions not in ground truth
2. It misses several solutions from ground truth
3. The general form (1,y,y) doesn't match the specific solutions in ground truth

<<<False>>>
