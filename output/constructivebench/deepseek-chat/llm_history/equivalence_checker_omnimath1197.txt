Ground Truth Answer: 1 / Nat.factorial 2004
Proposed Answer: 1 / (∏ k ∈ Finset.range 2004, (1 - (k + 1)))
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is about finding the coefficient a₁ in a system of equations involving Vandermonde-like conditions. The ground truth answer gives 1/2004! (1 divided by 2004 factorial), which is a standard result for such problems involving Vandermonde matrices.

The proposed answer gives 1 divided by a product of terms (1 - (k+1)) for k from 0 to 2003. Let's evaluate this product:

∏_{k=0}^{2003} (1 - (k+1)) = ∏_{k=1}^{2004} (-k) = (-1)^{2004} * 2004! = 2004!

So the proposed answer simplifies to 1/2004!, which matches the ground truth answer exactly.
