<<<1000 - 6 * (da + db)>>> 

Explanation: The problem describes two arithmetic sequences a and b with common differences da and db. The key conditions are a_20 + b_14 = 1000 and they never intersect. The answer follows from solving the system of equations while maintaining the non-intersection condition. The enumerated pattern suggests the solution is 1000 minus 6 times the sum of the differences.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

From the problem statement, we need to find the minimal s where s = b 20 + a 14, given the constraints about arithmetic sequences a and b. The key relationships are:
1. a and b are arithmetic sequences with common differences da and db respectively
2. a 20 + b 14 = 1000
3. All terms of a and b are distinct

Looking at the enumerated answers and the pattern, we can derive that the minimal s occurs when da and db are minimized (likely 1 each) to satisfy the distinctness condition. The proposed answer 1000 - 6*(da + db) is conceptually correct but needs to be generalized since da and db aren't defined in the global scope.

The correct closed form should express s in terms of the given constants (20, 14, 1000) without referencing da/db. From the arithmetic sequence properties and the equation a20 + b14 = 1000, we can derive that s = 1000 + 6*(db - da). The minimal s occurs when (db - da) is minimized, which is when da = 1, db = 2 (to maintain distinctness), giving s = 1000 + 6*(2-1) = 1006. However, the exact minimal value depends on the relationship between da and db.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<1006>>>

Explanation: The minimal s occurs when the common differences are smallest possible (da=1, db=2) to satisfy distinctness while maintaining the given sum constraint. The formula s = 1000 + 6*(db - da) gives 1006 in this minimal case. This matches the pattern seen in similar problems where minimal differences are used to achieve the least possible sum.
