noncomputable abbrev omnimath2631_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2631
(x y z w : ℝ)
(hw : w ≠ 0)
(hfrac : (x + 6 * y - 3 * z) / (-3 * x + 4 * w) = (-2 * y + z) / (x - w) ∧ (x + 6 * y - 3 * z) / (-3 * x + 4 * w) = 2 / 3)
: x / w = omnimath2631_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the problem and enumerated answers, we can deduce that the ratio x/w is constant. Solving the system of equations suggests x/w = 2/3. Here's the Lean answer:

<<<2 / 3>>>
