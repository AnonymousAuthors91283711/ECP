Looking at the pattern of the sum and considering the factorial terms in the denominator, this resembles a binomial coefficient. The numerator (k-1) suggests a derivative-like pattern. The sum appears to simplify to a constant involving e (Euler's number), as factorial sums often do in such contexts.
