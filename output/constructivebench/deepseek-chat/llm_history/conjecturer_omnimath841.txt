Looking at the problem, we have a recursive function f(a,b) with three cases based on comparison between a and b. The key observation is that this resembles the Euclidean algorithm but with a twist involving doubling a. For large b=3^2021 and a=1000, the function will repeatedly subtract multiples of a from b until b < 2a, then halve a. The final answer should be the remainder when 3^2021 is divided by 2000 (since we double 1000 until it's larger than b). 

<<<3 ^ 2021 % 2000>>>
