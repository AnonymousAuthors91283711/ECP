Ground Truth Answer: fun k => 3 * k
Proposed Answer: fun k => 6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is setting up a quadratic equation with coefficients involving k, then calculating a discriminant and roots P and Q. It then defines an area formula and states that when area=80, the answer should be 6.

2. The ground truth answer is a function `fun k => 3 * k`, meaning the answer depends on k.

3. The proposed answer is `fun k => 6`, a constant function that always returns 6 regardless of k.

The key observation is that the ground truth answer varies with k, while the proposed answer is constant. They are only equal when k=2 (since 3*2=6), but not for other values of k. Therefore, they are not equivalent in general.
