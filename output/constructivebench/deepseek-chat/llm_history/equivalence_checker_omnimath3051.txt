(hf2 : f 2 = 5)
(hf3 : f 3 = 7)
(hf : ∀ m n : ℕ, m > 0 → n > 0 → f m + f n = f (m * n))

Ground Truth Answer: 17
Proposed Answer: 23
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have a function f: ℕ → ℕ with:
   - f(2) = 5
   - f(3) = 7
   - f(m) + f(n) = f(m*n) for m,n > 0

2. We need to find f(12). Note that 12 = 2*2*3.

3. Using the functional equation:
   - f(2*2) = f(2) + f(2) = 5 + 5 = 10
   - f(4*3) = f(4) + f(3) = 10 + 7 = 17

4. The ground truth answer is 17, which matches this calculation.

5. The proposed answer is 23, which doesn't match our calculation.

The proposed answer is incorrect based on the given conditions and properties of the function. The correct answer should be 17.

<<<False>>>
