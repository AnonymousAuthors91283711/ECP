The error occurs because Lean expects semicolons or line breaks between multiple `let` bindings in a theorem statement. The proposed answer is correct mathematically (1/5040), but we need to fix the syntax. Here's the corrected version:

<<<1 / 5040>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem involves calculating a probability where:
   - Total possible sequences = 7! = 5040 (7×6×5×4×3×2×1)
   - Desired sequences = 1
   - Probability = desired/total = 1/5040

2. The error was purely syntactic - Lean requires proper separation between `let` bindings. The mathematical content was correct.

3. The answer is in ℚ as required, representing the exact rational value of the probability.

4. While the enumerated answers weren't provided, the problem clearly describes a probability calculation with 7! total outcomes and 1 desired outcome, leading to 1/5040.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
