abbrev olympiadbench2510_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2510 :
  let p (x : ℕ) := logb 100 (1 + 1 / x)
  let S := Finset.Icc 81 99
  ∑ x in S, p x = 2 * p olympiadbench2510_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern of the enumerated answers and the problem statement, we can observe that the sum of logarithms from 81 to 99 equals twice the logarithm of a single number. This suggests looking for a geometric mean relationship. The product (81*82*...*99) should equal (answer)^2. The midpoint of 81-99 is 90, which is likely the answer.

<<<90>>>
