theorem omnimath3414 : 
  ¬ ∃ (k : ℕ), (23 - omnimath3414_answer) = 3 * k ∧ omnimath3414_answer < 23 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the problem, we need to find a natural number x such that (23 - x) is not divisible by 3 and x < 23. The enumerated answers suggest numbers where 23 - x ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3. The smallest such number is 1 (since 23-1=22≡1 mod 3).
