Ground Truth Answer: 23/96
Proposed Answer: 5 / 32
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a Markov chain with transition probabilities:
   - Probability of winning after a win: 3/4
   - Probability of winning after a loss: 1/3
   - Initial probability of winning: 1/2

2. The formula calculates the probability of exactly 3 wins in 4 trials, considering the Markov property (probabilities depend on previous outcome).

3. The ground truth answer is 23/96 ≈ 0.239583

4. The proposed answer is 5/32 ≈ 0.15625

5. Calculating the exact value from the given formula:
   (1/2)*(3/4)*(3/4)*(1/4) + (1/2)*(3/4)*(1/4)*(1/3)*(2/3) + 
   (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/3)*(3/4)*(1/4) + (1/2)*(1/3)*(3/4)*(3/4)*(1/4)
   = 9/64 + 1/48 + 1/64 + 3/128
   = (18 + 4 + 3 + 3)/192
   = 28/192
   = 7/48 ≈ 0.145833

Neither the ground truth (23/96) nor the proposed answer (5/32) matches this calculation. However, the ground truth answer (23/96) is closer to what we'd expect for this type of problem.
