theorem P2023AMCA_1 :
  ∃ (t : ℝ), 0 ≤ t ∧ 18 * t + 12 * t = 45 ∧ 18 * t = P2023AMCA_1_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: 15 / 2. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 7, which is at "P2023AMCA_1_answer :" in "abbrev P2023AMCA_1_answer : ℝ := 15 / 2", there is an error: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instDivInvMonoid', and it does not have executable code.

Looking at the problem statement and the proposed answer, we need to find a real number t that satisfies two equations:
1. 18t + 12t = 45
2. 18t = P2023AMCA_1_answer

The first equation simplifies to 30t = 45, giving t = 1.5. Plugging this into the second equation gives P2023AMCA_1_answer = 18 * 1.5 = 27.

The error occurs because division of real numbers in Lean is noncomputable by default. We need to either:
1. Mark the definition as noncomputable, or
2. Use a computable division (like for rationals), but since the problem specifies ℝ, we'll go with option 1.

The correct answer should be 27, not 15/2. Here's the fixed version:

<<<27>>> 

Explanation:
1. Solved the equation 18t + 12t = 45 to get t = 1.5
2. Substituted into 18t to get the answer 27
3. The original proposed answer 15/2 was incorrect
4. The answer is a simple real number that satisfies both equations
