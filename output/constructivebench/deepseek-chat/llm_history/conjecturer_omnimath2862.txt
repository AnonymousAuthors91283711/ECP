From the problem statement, we're looking for the number of positive integer solutions (x,y) to the equation x/4 = 9/y, which simplifies to x*y = 36. The number of positive integer pairs (x,y) that satisfy this is equal to the number of positive divisors of 36. Since 36 = 2^2 * 3^2, the number of divisors is (2+1)*(2+1) = 9.
