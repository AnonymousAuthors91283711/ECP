  ∃! (P : Polynomial ℚ), P.degree ≤ 2015 ∧
  (∀ n ∈ Finset.range 2016, P.eval (↑(n + 1) : ℚ) = Q (n + 1)) ∧
  ⌊(2017 : ℚ) * (P.eval (2017 : ℚ))⌋ = omnimath1649_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℤ
<<<2016>>> 

Explanation: The pattern suggests evaluating the polynomial at 2017 gives 1/2016^2, so 2017 * P(2017) = 2017/2016^2. The floor of this is 0 when 2017 < 2016^2, which holds since 2016^2 = 4064256 > 2017.
