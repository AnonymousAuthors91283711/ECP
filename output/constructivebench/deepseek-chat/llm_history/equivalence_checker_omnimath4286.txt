Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0), (2, 1), (-2, 1)}
Proposed Answer: {(0, 0), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (2, 1), (-2, 1), (5, 2), (-5, 2)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation is x²(1 + x²) = -1 + 21ʸ
2. We need to find all integer x and natural number y pairs that satisfy this

Checking the ground truth answer:
- (0,0): 0(1+0) = -1 + 1 → 0 = 0 ✓
- (2,1): 4(1+4) = -1 + 21 → 20 = 20 ✓
- (-2,1): same as (2,1) ✓

Checking the proposed answer's additional pairs:
- (1,0): 1(1+1) = -1 + 1 → 2 = 0 ✗
- (-1,0): same as (1,0) ✗
- (5,2): 25(1+25) = -1 + 441 → 650 = 440 ✗
- (-5,2): same as (5,2) ✗

The proposed answer contains incorrect pairs that don't satisfy the equation. Only the ground truth answer is completely correct.
