Ground Truth Answer: {3}
Proposed Answer: {n | ∃ k : ℕ, n = 2 * k + 1 ∧ k ≤ 3} ∪ {4, 6}
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The ground truth answer is simply {3}, meaning only n=3 satisfies the condition.

2. The proposed answer is much larger: all odd numbers ≤7 plus {4,6}.

3. Let's test n=3:
   - For n=3, we can find k=5 since 5² = 25 = 3*2⁴+1 = 3*16+1 = 49 (but wait, 3*16+1=49? No, 3*16+1=49? 3*16=48, +1=49. 5²=25≠49. Hmm, this suggests even the ground truth might be wrong, but let's assume the condition is correct.)

4. Testing n=1:
   - 1*2²+1=5, but no integer k satisfies k²=5
   - Not in ground truth, but in proposed answer (k=0 gives n=1)

5. Testing n=3 again:
   - 3*2⁴+1=49, 7²=49 → satisfies condition (so ground truth is correct)

6. Testing other values in proposed answer:
   - n=5: 5*2⁶+1=321, not a perfect square
   - n=7: 7*2⁸+1=1793, not a perfect square
   - n=4: 4*2⁵+1=129, not a perfect square
   - n=6: 6*2⁷+1=769, not a perfect square

The proposed answer includes many numbers that don't satisfy the condition, while the ground truth correctly identifies only n=3 works.
