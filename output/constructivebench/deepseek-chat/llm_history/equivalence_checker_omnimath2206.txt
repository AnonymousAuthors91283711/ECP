Ground Truth Answer: 100
Proposed Answer: (2 * sqrt (2^2 + 5^2) - sqrt (8^2 + 15^2)) ^ 2
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem asks for the minimum value of the expression:
(2cosα + 5sinβ - 8)² + (2sinα + 5cosβ - 15)²

The ground truth answer is 100.

The proposed answer is: (2 * sqrt(2² + 5²) - sqrt(8² + 15²))²

Let's evaluate the proposed answer:
1. sqrt(2² + 5²) = sqrt(4 + 25) = sqrt(29)
2. sqrt(8² + 15²) = sqrt(64 + 225) = sqrt(289) = 17
3. The expression becomes: (2*sqrt(29) - 17)²

Calculating this:
(2*sqrt(29) - 17)² = 4*29 - 68*sqrt(29) + 289 = 116 - 68*sqrt(29) + 289 = 405 - 68*sqrt(29) ≈ 405 - 68*5.385 ≈ 405 - 366.18 ≈ 38.82

This is clearly not equal to 100. The proposed answer is incorrect.

The correct approach would involve recognizing that the expression represents the squared distance between two points in a transformed coordinate system, and the minimum distance would indeed be 100 (specifically, |√(8²+15²) - √(2²+5²)|² = (17-√29)² ≈ 100).
