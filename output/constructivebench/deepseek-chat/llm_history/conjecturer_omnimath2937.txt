: (3 * 3 * 5 * 5 * 7 * 9 = 3 * 3 * 7 * omnimath2937_answer * omnimath2937_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the equation:
3*3*5*5*7*9 = 3*3*7*x*x

Simplify both sides:
9*25*7*9 = 9*7*x²
Divide both sides by 9*7:
25*9 = x²
Thus x² = 225
Therefore x = 15

<<<15>>>
