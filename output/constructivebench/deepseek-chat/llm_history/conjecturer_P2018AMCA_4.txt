open Set

abbrev P2018AMCA_4_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem P2018AMCA_4 (d : ℝ) :
    (¬ (d ≥ 6) ∧ ¬ (d ≤ 5) ∧ ¬ (d ≤ 4)) ↔ d ∈ P2018AMCA_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
<<<Ioo (5 : ℝ) 6>>> 

Explanation: The problem describes a real number d that is not ≥6 (so d<6), not ≤5 (so d>5), and not ≤4 (redundant since d>5 already implies d>4). This matches the open interval (5,6).
