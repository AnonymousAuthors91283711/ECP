From the given conditions and the pattern of enumerated answers, we can deduce that the solution likely involves solving a system of equations involving square roots. The key observation is that setting x = a² and y = b² simplifies the equations. The first condition becomes a + b = 4, and the second becomes √(a² + 2) + √(b² + 2) = 5. Solving this system leads to a quadratic equation.
