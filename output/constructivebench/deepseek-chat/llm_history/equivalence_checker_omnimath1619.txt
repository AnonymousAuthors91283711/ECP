Ground Truth Answer: 131/10
Proposed Answer: 20
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the expected number of moves in some probabilistic process involving divisors of numbers from 1 to 20 (excluding 0).

2. The ground truth answer is 131/10, which equals 13.1.

3. The proposed answer is 20, which is significantly larger than 13.1.

4. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth either in exact form (131/10 vs 20) or in decimal approximation (13.1 vs 20).

5. There's no obvious simplification or transformation that would make 20 equivalent to 131/10 in this context.
