Ground Truth Answer: {2 ^ 2007}
Proposed Answer: {x : ℝ | ∃ n : ℕ, x = ((1 + √2)^(2 * n + 1) + (1 - √2)^(2 * n + 1)) / 2}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a recurrence relation: aₙ₊₂ = 6aₙ - aₙ₊₁ with a₀ = 1 and all terms positive.

2. The ground truth answer suggests that the only possible value for a₂₀₀₇ is 2²⁰⁰⁷.

3. The proposed answer gives a general form for solutions to the recurrence relation, expressed in terms of powers of (1±√2).

Analysis:
- The recurrence relation is linear with characteristic equation r² + r - 6 = 0, whose roots are 2 and -3.
- The general solution should be of form c₁·2ⁿ + c₂·(-3)ⁿ.
- The initial condition a₀ = 1 gives c₁ + c₂ = 1.
- The positivity condition ∀n, aₙ > 0 is very restrictive and essentially forces c₂ = 0 (since the (-3)ⁿ term would dominate and make terms negative for odd n).
- Therefore, the only solution is aₙ = 2ⁿ, meaning a₂₀₀₇ = 2²⁰⁰⁷.

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It presents a solution form that doesn't match the recurrence relation (the given form solves a different recurrence)
2. It doesn't satisfy the initial condition a₀ = 1
3. The form given would actually solve a recurrence like aₙ₊₂ = 2aₙ₊₁ + aₙ
