Looking at the problem, we need to find the sum of powers of the imaginary unit Complex.I from i^0 to i^2009. The powers of i cycle every 4 terms: i^0=1, i^1=i, i^2=-1, i^3=-i, i^4=1, etc.

The sum can be broken down into complete cycles of 4 terms plus any remaining terms. Since 2010 terms (from 0 to 2009) is 502 full cycles (2008 terms) plus 2 extra terms (i^2008 and i^2009).

Each full cycle sums to 0 (1 + i - 1 - i = 0). The remaining terms are i^2008 = (i^4)^502 = 1 and i^2009 = i. So the total sum is 1 + i.

The proposed answer (1 - i)/2 was incorrect. The correct answer should be 1 + i. Here's the fixed version:

<<<1 + Complex.I>>>

Explanation:
1. The powers of i cycle every 4 terms with sum 0 per cycle
2. 2010 terms = 502 full cycles (2008 terms) + 2 extra terms
3. The extra terms are i^2008 = 1 and i^2009 = i
4. Total sum = 1 + i
