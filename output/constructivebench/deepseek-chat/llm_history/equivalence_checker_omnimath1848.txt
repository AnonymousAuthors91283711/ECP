Ground Truth Answer: 2017 / 1008
Proposed Answer: (1/2 + 1/2017) / (1 - (1/2 + 1/2017))
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a set S of natural numbers whose only prime divisors are 2 and 2017. This means S contains numbers of the form 2^a * 2017^b where a,b ≥ 0 (but s > 0).

2. The sum in question is the sum of reciprocals of all such numbers.

3. The ground truth answer is 2017/1008.

4. The proposed answer is (1/2 + 1/2017)/(1 - (1/2 + 1/2017)).

Let's evaluate the proposed answer:
- The numerator (1/2 + 1/2017) represents the sum of reciprocals of the prime divisors.
- The denominator (1 - (1/2 + 1/2017)) suggests an infinite geometric series approach.
- However, this doesn't correctly account for all combinations of exponents (2^a * 2017^b).

The correct approach would be to recognize this as a product of two geometric series:
(1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + ...) * (1 + 1/2017 + 1/2017² + ...) - 1
= (1/(1-1/2)) * (1/(1-1/2017)) - 1
= 2 * (2017/2016) - 1
= 2017/1008 - 1008/1008
= 1009/1008

Wait, this seems incorrect. Actually, the correct sum should be:
(1/(1-1/2)) * (1/(1-1/2017)) - 1 = 2 * (2017/2016) - 1 = 4034/2016 - 1 = 2018/2016 = 1009/1008

But the ground truth is 2017/1008, which is different. There seems to be some confusion here.

The proposed answer evaluates to:
(1/2 + 1/2017)/(1 - 1/2 - 1/2017) = (1008.5/2017)/((2017 - 1008.5)/2017) = (1008.5/2017)/(1008.5/2017) = 1

This is clearly different from both the ground truth and my calculation. Therefore:

<<<False>>>
