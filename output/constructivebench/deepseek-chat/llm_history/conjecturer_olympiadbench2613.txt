From the problem statement, we need to find a closed form solution for the recurrence relation u(n+2) = 3u(n+1) - u(n) with initial conditions u(3)=5 and u(6)=89. The answer should be of type ℤ (not a function), specifically the value u(7).

Looking at the recurrence and initial conditions:
1. This is a linear recurrence with characteristic equation r² - 3r + 1 = 0
2. The general solution would be u(n) = Aφ^n + Bψ^n where φ=(3+√5)/2 and ψ=(3-√5)/2
3. Using the initial conditions, we can solve for A and B
4. For n=7, we calculate u(7) = 3*u(6) - u(5), but we need u(5) first
5. Working backwards: u(4) = (u(6) + u(3))/3 = (89+5)/3 = 94/3 ≈ 31.33, but this isn't integer - suggests the recurrence might only hold for n≥1 with different initial conditions
6. Alternative approach: Compute sequence directly:
   u(3)=5, u(4)=3*5-u(2)=15-u(2)
   u(5)=3*u(4)-5=45-3*u(2)-5=40-3*u(2)
   u(6)=3*(40-3*u(2))-(15-u(2))=120-9u(2)-15+u(2)=105-8u(2)=89 ⇒ u(2)=2
   Then u(4)=15-2=13
   u(5)=40-3*2=34
   u(7)=3*89-34=267-34=233

However, the problem states T=7 and expects u(7) as answer. The correct value is 233, not 377 as previously guessed.

<<<233>>>
