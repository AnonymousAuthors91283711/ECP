Looking at the pattern of exponents of 2 in the product, we notice it's maximized when considering differences between consecutive numbers. The maximum exponent occurs at n=8 since floor(20/2) + floor(20/4) + floor(20/8) + floor(20/16) = 10+5+2+1 = 18, but we need to consider pairwise differences which gives us n=8.
