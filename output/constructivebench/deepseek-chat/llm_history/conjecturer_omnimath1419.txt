Looking at the recurrence relations and initial conditions, this resembles a modified Fibonacci sequence. The modulo 100 operation suggests we're looking for periodic behavior (Pisano period). The pattern likely cycles every 60 steps (since φ(100)=40 and 60 is a common period for such problems). 2012 mod 60 gives 32, so we need x₃₂ mod 100.
