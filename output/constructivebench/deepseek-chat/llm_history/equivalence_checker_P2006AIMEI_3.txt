Ground Truth Answer: 725
Proposed Answer: 290 + 29 * 10 * 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest positive integer n where:
   - n has a digit d (in base 10)
   - When you remove this digit from the front, the remaining number k equals n - d*10^(length-1)
   - This k must also equal n/29

2. Ground truth answer is 725:
   - Digits: [7,2,5]
   - Remove first digit: 25
   - 725/29 = 25
   - This satisfies all conditions

3. Proposed answer is 290 + 29*10*9 = 290 + 2610 = 2900:
   - Digits: [2,9,0,0]
   - Remove first digit: 900
   - 2900/29 = 100 ≠ 900
   - Doesn't satisfy the condition

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the problem's conditions, while the ground truth answer does. They are not equivalent.
