Ground Truth Answer: 2240
Proposed Answer: 120
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for natural numbers a, b, c, d > 0 where:
   - a! * b! * c! = d!
   - a + b + c + d = 37
   - a * b * c * d = answer

2. The ground truth answer is 2240, which comes from the solution:
   - (a,b,c,d) = (5,5,4,7) since:
     - 5! * 5! * 4! = 120*120*24 = 345600 = 7! (5040)
     - 5+5+4+7 = 21 ≠ 37 (This doesn't satisfy the sum condition)
   Wait, this seems incorrect. Actually the correct solution is:
   - (a,b,c,d) = (6,6,3,8):
     - 6! * 6! * 3! = 720*720*6 = 3110400 = 8! (40320) → No, this doesn't work
   - The actual correct solution is:
     - (a,b,c,d) = (5,5,6,7):
       - 5! * 5! * 6! = 120*120*720 = 10368000 ≠ 7! (5040) → Doesn't work
   - It seems I can't find a combination that satisfies both the factorial and sum conditions to give 2240.

3. The proposed answer is 120, which would come from something like:
   - (1,1,1,3):
     - 1!*1!*1! = 1 = 3! → False
   - (2,2,1,3):
     - 2!*2!*1! = 4 ≠ 6 = 3!
   - No small combinations seem to work either.

Given that neither answer seems to satisfy all conditions, and the ground truth 2240 doesn't appear to correspond to any valid solution, while 120 is clearly too small, I conclude:

<<<False>>>
