Ground Truth Answer: 577
Proposed Answer: 2^100 + 2^1 + 2^0
Let's analyze this problem carefully:

1. The problem defines a set S of natural numbers that can be expressed as the sum of three distinct powers of 2 (2^x + 2^y + 2^z where x, y, z are distinct).

2. The theorem asks for the smallest number in S that has exactly 99 smaller numbers in S.

3. The ground truth answer is 577, which can be expressed as 2^9 + 2^6 + 2^0 (512 + 64 + 1).

4. The proposed answer is 2^100 + 2^1 + 2^0, which is an extremely large number (1,267,650,600,228,229,401,496,703,205,376 + 2 + 1).

The proposed answer is clearly incorrect because:
- It's vastly larger than 577
- There would be many more than 99 smaller numbers in S before reaching this number
- The correct answer should be much smaller, as shown by the ground truth
