Ground Truth Answer: 7/128
Proposed Answer: 1 / 16
Let me analyze this problem carefully.

The problem involves calculating a double sum of probabilities where a + b equals either 12 or 20. The probability function p(n) is defined as:
- 1/2 when n=17
- 1/32 when 1 ≤ n ≤ 16
- 0 otherwise

To verify the proposed answer (1/16) against the ground truth (7/128), let's consider the possible cases:

1. Cases where a + b = 12:
- Possible pairs: (4,8), (5,7), (6,6), (7,5), (8,4)
- All these involve numbers ≤16, so p(a)*p(b) = (1/32)*(1/32) = 1/1024 for each
- There are 5 such pairs (note (6,6) is counted once in the sum)
- Total contribution: 5 * 1/1024 = 5/1024

2. Cases where a + b = 20:
- Possible pairs: (3,17), (4,16), ..., (17,3)
- The pair (17,3) and (3,17) contribute (1/2)*(1/32) = 1/64 each
- The pairs (4,16) to (16,4) contribute (1/32)*(1/32) = 1/1024 each
- There are 13 such pairs (from (4,16) to (16,4)) plus 2 for (3,17) and (17,3)
- Total contribution: 2*(1/64) + 13*(1/1024) = 32/1024 + 13/1024 = 45/1024

Combining both cases: 5/1024 + 45/1024 = 50/1024 = 25/512 ≈ 0.0488
Ground truth: 7/128 ≈ 0.0547
Proposed answer: 1/16 = 0.0625

These are clearly different values, so the answers are not equivalent.
