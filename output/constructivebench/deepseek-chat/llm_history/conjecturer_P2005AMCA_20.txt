From the problem statement and enumerated answers, we're looking for the number of fixed points of the 2005th iterate of some function f on [0,1] that map to 1/2. The pattern suggests this is related to binary representations and the number of distinct fractional parts after 2005 iterations. The answer appears to be a power of 2 related to the iteration count.
