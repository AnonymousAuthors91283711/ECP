Ground Truth Answer: 331
Proposed Answer: Nat.choose 65 2 - 3 * 32 + 2 * 1
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem is asking for the number of ordered triples (a,b,c) where:
   - a + b + c = 66
   - 0 < a < b < c

2. This is equivalent to counting the number of strict partitions of 66 into 3 parts.

3. The standard combinatorial approach would be:
   - First count all triples with a + b + c = 66 and a,b,c ≥ 1 (using stars and bars)
   - Then adjust for the ordering constraint a < b < c

4. The ground truth answer is 331, which is correct for this problem.

5. The proposed answer is Nat.choose 65 2 - 3 * 32 + 2 * 1:
   - Nat.choose 65 2 = 2080 (which is C(66-1, 3-1) for positive solutions)
   - But the adjustment terms (-3*32 + 2*1 = -94) don't correctly account for the ordering constraints
   - The correct adjustment should divide by 3! = 6, giving 2080/6 ≈ 346.66, which isn't an integer
   - The actual count needs more careful handling of the divisibility constraints

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth and the formula appears incorrect.
