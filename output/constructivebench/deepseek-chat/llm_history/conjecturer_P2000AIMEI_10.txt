From the problem statement and enumerated answers, we can deduce that the solution involves a sequence where each term xₖ is related to the sum of all terms minus itself and its index. This suggests a linear relationship. The unique solution for xₖ appears to be a linear function of k, specifically xₖ = C - k where C is a constant determined by the sum condition. For k=49, we get x₄₉ = C - 49. The exact value can be derived from the constraints.
