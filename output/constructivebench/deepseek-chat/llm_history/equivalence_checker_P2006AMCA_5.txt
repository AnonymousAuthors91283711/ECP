Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: 5
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer step by step.

1. Given:
   - Total slices = 8
   - Plain pizza cost = $8
   - Anchovy topping cost = $2
   - Anchovy slices = 8/2 = 4
   - Plain slices = 8 - 4 = 4

2. Consumption:
   - Dave ate: 1 plain slice + 4 anchovy slices
   - Doug ate: remaining 3 plain slices

3. Calculations:
   - Dave's payment:
     - Plain portion: (1 * 8)/8 = $1
     - Anchovy portion: (4 * (8+2))/4 = $10
     - Total: $1 + $10 = $11

   - Doug's payment:
     - Plain portion: (3 * 8)/8 = $3

4. Difference:
   - Dave's payment - Doug's payment = $11 - $3 = $8

Wait, this contradicts both the ground truth (4) and proposed answer (5). However, looking back at the problem statement, the calculation for Dave's anchovy portion seems incorrect. The correct calculation should be:

Dave's anchovy portion should be (4 * 2)/4 = $2 (just for the anchovy topping), plus his share of the plain pizza (1 * 8)/8 = $1, totaling $3.

Doug's payment is correct at $3.

Difference would be $3 - $3 = $0, which still doesn't match.

This suggests there might be a different interpretation of how the costs are divided. Given that neither my initial calculation nor the correction matches either answer, and since the proposed answer (5) is closer to neither the ground truth (4) nor the correct calculation, we should conclude:

<<<False>>>
