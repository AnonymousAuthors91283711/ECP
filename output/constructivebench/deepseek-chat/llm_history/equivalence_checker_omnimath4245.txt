Ground Truth Answer: {(19, 95), (16, 64), (11, 11), (26, 65), (22, 22), (33, 33), 
    (49, 98), (44, 44), (55, 55), (66, 66), (77, 77), (88, 88), (99, 99)}
Proposed Answer: {(11, 11), (22, 22), (33, 33), (44, 44), (55, 55), (66, 66), (77, 77), (88, 88), (99, 99)}

The proposed answer contains all the palindromic pairs where a = b (11,11 through 99,99), but is missing the non-palindromic solutions (19,95), (16,64), (26,65), and (49,98) that are present in the ground truth answer. The proposed answer is partially correct but incomplete.
