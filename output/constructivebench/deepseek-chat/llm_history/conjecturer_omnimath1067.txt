From the problem statement and enumerated answers, we can observe that:
1. The problem involves 3×3 matrices with specific divisibility conditions
2. The top-left entry is fixed to 1 and bottom-right to 2009
3. The count appears to be related to the number of divisors of 2009

Since 2009 = 7² × 41, its number of divisors is (2+1)(1+1) = 6. The pattern suggests the answer is the number of ordered factorizations of 2009 into 4 terms (for the remaining entries).

<<<6>>>
