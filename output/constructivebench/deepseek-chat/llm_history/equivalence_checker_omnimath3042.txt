Ground Truth Answer: 27
Proposed Answer: 21
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have two equations:
   - x² + 3xy + y² = 909
   - 3x² + xy + 3y² = 1287

2. We need to find x + y.

3. Ground truth answer is 27, proposed answer is 21.

To check equivalence, let's see if 21 could be a solution:

If x + y = 21, let's see if it satisfies both equations. However, if we try simple integer values that sum to 21 (like x=10, y=11), we find:
- 10² + 3*10*11 + 11² = 100 + 330 + 121 = 551 ≠ 909
This already fails the first equation.

The ground truth answer 27 works with x=12, y=15:
- 12² + 3*12*15 + 15² = 144 + 540 + 225 = 909
- 3*12² + 12*15 + 3*15² = 432 + 180 + 675 = 1287

The proposed answer 21 doesn't satisfy the given equations.
