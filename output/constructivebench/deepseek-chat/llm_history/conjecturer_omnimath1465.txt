From the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we can deduce that we're looking for the cardinality of the set of real triples (a,b,c) that satisfy the given polynomial conditions. The conditions involve a quartic polynomial with three distinct real roots related through tangent functions. The pattern suggests there's exactly one such triple.
