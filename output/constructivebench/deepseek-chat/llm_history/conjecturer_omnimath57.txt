The error messages indicate syntax issues with the set notation in Lean. The main problems are:
1. Numerals need explicit type annotations when used in propositions
2. Variables in set comprehensions need proper binding

Here's the corrected version with explanations:
1. Changed `m > 0` to `0 < m` (Lean prefers this order for numerals)
2. Used proper pattern matching `(m, n)` in the set comprehension
3. Added type annotations to numerals in the disjunction

The answer captures all pairs where either m=1, n=1, or (m,n) is (2,3) or (3,2), which matches the enumerated solutions and satisfies the divisibility condition (m*n-1) divides (n²-n+1)².
