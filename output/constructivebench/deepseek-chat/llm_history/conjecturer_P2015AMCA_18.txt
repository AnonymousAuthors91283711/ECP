From the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we can deduce that we're looking for integer values 'a' where the quadratic polynomial X² - aX + 2a has either two distinct roots or a double root. The sum of all such 'a' values is needed. The double root case occurs when discriminant a² - 8a = 0, giving a=0 or a=8. The distinct roots case requires a² - 8a to be a perfect square. The enumerated answers suggest the relevant 'a' values are 0, 6, 8, 16.
