Looking at the problem, we're creating a list from 1 to 20 (originalList), splitting it into first 10 and last 10 elements, then concatenating them in reverse order (secondHalf ++ firstHalf). We're asked for the element at index 12 in this new list. The enumerated answers show the pattern that index n in newList corresponds to n+10 when n < 10, else n-10. For index 12, this gives 12-10=2.
