noncomputable abbrev omnimath2464_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2464 :
  (∫ t in Icc 0 2, (if t ≤ 0.25 then 50 else if t ≤ 0.5 then 50 - 60*(t - 0.25) else 0) * (1/2)) = omnimath2464_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 55/2
Proposed Answer: (50 * 0.25 + (50 + 20) * 0.25 / 2) * (1/2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The integral is piecewise defined:
   - From 0 to 0.25: constant 50
   - From 0.25 to 0.5: linear function 50 - 60*(t - 0.25)
   - From 0.5 to 2: 0

2. The ground truth answer is 55/2 = 27.5

3. The proposed answer breaks down as:
   - First term (50*0.25): area of rectangle from 0 to 0.25
   - Second term ((50+20)*0.25/2): area of trapezoid from 0.25 to 0.5
     (at t=0.25, value is 50; at t=0.5, value is 50-60*0.25=35, not 20)
   - Then multiplied by (1/2) from the integral

The error is in the second term - it should be (50+35)*0.25/2, not (50+20)*0.25/2. The calculation of the endpoint at t=0.5 is incorrect.
