Looking at the problem, we need to find the sum of all real solutions x between 100 and 200 that satisfy the given trigonometric equation. The error in the proposed answer is due to using π directly without marking the definition as noncomputable.

From the trigonometric equation and the range constraints, we can deduce that the solutions are likely angles in degrees (since we see π/180 conversions). The pattern suggests solutions might be symmetric around 150° (since 150 is the midpoint of 100-200 range). The enumerated answers hint at 150 being significant.

The correct answer should be the sum of all valid solutions, which appears to be 150 when converted back to radians (150 * π/180). However, we need to mark it as noncomputable since it involves real numbers and trigonometric functions.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<150 * π / 180>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem involves trigonometric functions with degree-to-radian conversions (π/180 factors)
2. The range 100-200 suggests solutions might be symmetric around 150°
3. The enumerated answers point to 150 as the key value
4. The answer needs to be in radians (hence π/180 conversion)
5. The noncomputable marker is needed for real number operations involving π[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
