Looking at the problem constraints and the enumerated answers, we need to find the number of ordered quadruples (a,b,c,d) satisfying:
1. 0 < a < b < c < d
2. a*c + a*d + b*c + b*d = 2023
3. a + b + c + d = 296

The key observation is that the second condition can be rewritten as (a+b)(c+d) = 2023. Factoring 2023 gives us possible pairs for (a+b, c+d). The answer is the number of valid factor pairs that satisfy all conditions.
