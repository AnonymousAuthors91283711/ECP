  Nat.card {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ n < 30 ∧ ∃ k > 0, n = k * (30 - n)} = P2014AMCB_7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the equation n = k*(30 - n), we can rearrange it to n*(k+1) = 30k. The enumerated solutions (found via program) are 5, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24. The count of these solutions is 7.
