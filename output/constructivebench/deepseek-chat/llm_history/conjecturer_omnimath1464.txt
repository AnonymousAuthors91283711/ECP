From the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we can observe that the minimal n where a(n) = 2014 occurs when we always choose the recursive case a(i+1) = 2*a(i)+1. This forms a geometric progression that reaches 2014 fastest. The closed form is a(n) = 2^n * a0 + (2^n - 1). Solving 2^n * a0 + (2^n - 1) = 2014 for minimal n with a0 ≥ 1 gives n=10 when a0=1.
