noncomputable abbrev omnimath3350_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3350 :
  2 * Real.sqrt (1.5 + Real.sqrt 2) - (1.5 + Real.sqrt 2) = omnimath3350_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1 / 2
Proposed Answer: Real.sqrt 2 - 0.5
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The equation given is:
2 * √(1.5 + √2) - (1.5 + √2) = ?

Ground truth answer: 1/2 = 0.5
Proposed answer: √2 - 0.5 ≈ 1.4142 - 0.5 = 0.9142

Let's compute the left side numerically:
√2 ≈ 1.4142
1.5 + √2 ≈ 2.9142
√(1.5 + √2) ≈ √2.9142 ≈ 1.7071
2 * 1.7071 ≈ 3.4142
3.4142 - 2.9142 ≈ 0.5

The numerical computation matches the ground truth answer (0.5), not the proposed answer (≈0.9142).
