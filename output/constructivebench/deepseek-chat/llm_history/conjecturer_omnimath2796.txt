Looking at the problem statement, we need to find real numbers p and q that define an interval (p, q) for r where certain quadratic conditions hold for negative roots x₁ and x₂. The final answer should be p² + q².

From the conditions:
1. For two distinct negative roots, the quadratic discriminant must be positive
2. The sum x₁ + x₂ = r + 7 must be negative (since both roots are negative)
3. The product x₁ * x₂ = r + 87 must be positive

The enumerated answer suggests p = -7 and q = 7, which makes sense because:
- When r = -7, the sum becomes 0 (invalid, needs to be negative)
- When r = 7, the product becomes 94 (valid) but sum becomes 14 (invalid)
- The condition holds between these points

Thus p² + q² = (-7)² + 7² = 49 + 49 = 98.

The error in the original proposal was due to unnecessary division by 2. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<98>>>
