theorem omnimath55 (n : ℕ) :
  IsLeast {s : ℕ | ∃ (f : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)), 
          s = ∑ i, min (f i).val (2 * i.val + 1)} (omnimath55_answer n) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => ∑ i in range n, min (n + 1 - (i + 1)) (2 * (i + 1) - 1)
Proposed Answer: fun n => n * (n + 1) / 2 + (n % 2)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
We need to find the minimal sum of min(f(i), 2i+1) over all permutations f of Fin n. The ground truth answer suggests pairing elements in a specific way to minimize the sum.

Ground Truth Answer:
This gives a precise formula using a sum that pairs elements from opposite ends (n+1-(i+1)) with (2*(i+1)-1). This is a valid approach for minimizing the sum.

Proposed Answer:
This gives a closed-form formula n*(n+1)/2 + (n mod 2). This appears to be the formula for triangular numbers plus a parity term, which doesn't obviously match the ground truth's construction.

Comparison:
For n=1:
- Ground truth: min(1,1) = 1
- Proposed: 1*2/2 + 1 = 2 → Incorrect

For n=2:
- Ground truth: min(2,1) + min(1,3) = 1+1 = 2
- Proposed: 2*3/2 + 0 = 3 → Incorrect

For n=3:
- Ground truth: min(3,1) + min(2,3) + min(1,5) = 1+2+1 = 4
- Proposed: 3*4/2 + 1 = 7 → Incorrect

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth in these small cases, and there's no clear relationship between the formulas.
