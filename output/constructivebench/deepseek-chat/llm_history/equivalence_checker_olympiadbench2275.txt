abbrev olympiadbench2275_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2275 : 
  (digits 10 ((10^3 + 1)^2)).sum = olympiadbench2275_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1002001
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze this problem carefully:

1. The problem is asking for the sum of the digits of (10³ + 1)² when written in base 10.

2. First calculate (10³ + 1) = 1001
3. Then (1001)² = 1002001
4. The digits are 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1
5. The sum is 1 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 4

The ground truth answer (1002001) appears to be giving the result of (1001)², while the proposed answer (4) is correctly giving the sum of its digits.

The answers are not equivalent, but the proposed answer is actually correct for what the problem is asking (sum of digits), while the ground truth answer is showing the intermediate calculation.
