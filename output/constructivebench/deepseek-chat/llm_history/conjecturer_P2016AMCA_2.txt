Looking at the problem statement, we need to solve the equation (10^x)*(100^(2x)) = (1000^5) for x. Let's analyze the equation:

1. Rewrite all terms with base 10:
   - 100 = 10^2
   - 1000 = 10^3
2. The equation becomes: (10^x)*(10^(2*2x)) = (10^(3*5))
3. Simplify exponents: 10^(x + 4x) = 10^15
4. Therefore: 5x = 15 → x = 3

The error in the proposed answer was using integer division (/) instead of real division. We need to use the Real division operator and mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real numbers.

Here's the corrected answer:
