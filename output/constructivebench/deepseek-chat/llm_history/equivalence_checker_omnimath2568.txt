abbrev omnimath2568_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2568 : 
  Infinite omnimath2568_answer ∧ ∀ a ∈ omnimath2568_answer, ∀ b ∈ omnimath2568_answer, a < b → Squarefree (a + b) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: sorry  -- The actual construction is non-trivial
Proposed Answer: {n | Squarefree (n + 1)}
<<<False>>>
The proposed answer suggests that the set of all natural numbers n where n+1 is squarefree would satisfy the conditions. However, this is incorrect because:

1. While it's true that for any n in this set, n+1 is squarefree, the condition requires that for any two elements a < b in the set, a+b must be squarefree. The proposed set doesn't guarantee this - for example, take a=1 (1+1=2 is squarefree) and b=3 (3+1=4 is not squarefree, but 3 is in the set since 3+1=4 is not squarefree - wait this seems contradictory to the proposed set definition).

Actually, the proposed set is {n | Squarefree (n+1)}, so b=3 would not be in the set (since 3+1=4 is not squarefree). But consider a=1 (in set) and b=2 (in set, since 2+1=3 is squarefree), then a+b=3 is squarefree. However, take a=2 and b=7 (both in set since 3 and 8 are squarefree), but a+b=9 is not squarefree. Therefore, the proposed answer doesn't satisfy the second condition of the theorem.

The ground truth answer would need a more sophisticated construction that ensures the sum of any two elements is squarefree, which the proposed answer fails to do.
