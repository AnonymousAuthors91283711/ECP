From the problem statement and error message, I can see that:
1. The proposed answer `2 * x` is trying to use `x` which is not in scope for the abbreviation definition
2. The theorem shows `x` and `v` are parameters with `x = 2` and `v = 3 * x`
3. The equation to solve is `2 * v - 5 - (2 * x - 5) = answer`

Let's simplify the equation:
`2 * v - 5 - (2 * x - 5) = 2 * v - 5 - 2 * x + 5 = 2 * v - 2 * x = 2 * (v - x)`

Given `v = 3 * x`, this becomes:
`2 * (3 * x - x) = 2 * (2 * x) = 4 * x`

Since `x = 2`, the concrete answer would be `8`, but we need a general form in terms of `x`.

The correct answer should be `4 * x` expressed without dependencies on variables.

<<<4 * 2>>> 

Explanation: The error occurred because we tried to use `x` in the abbreviation when it wasn't in scope. The correct answer is derived from simplifying the given equation and substituting the relationship between v and x. Since x is fixed at 2 in the theorem, we can directly compute the answer as 8 (4*2), but the problem expects a ℝ value.
