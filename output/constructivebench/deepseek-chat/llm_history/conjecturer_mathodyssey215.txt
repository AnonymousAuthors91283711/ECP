abbrev mathodyssey215_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem mathodyssey215
: (∀ x : ℝ, √(x ^ 2 + 2 * x - 6) = √(x ^ 2 - 14) ↔ x = mathodyssey215_answer) := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: 5 / 2. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 7, which is at "mathodyssey215_answe" in "abbrev mathodyssey215_answer : ℝ := 5 / 2", there is an error: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instDivInvMonoid', and it does not have executable code.

Looking at the problem, we need to find a real number x that satisfies the equation √(x² + 2x - 6) = √(x² - 14). The enumerated answer suggests 5/2 is a candidate, but we need to make it compile in Lean.

The error occurs because Lean's division on ℝ is noncomputable by default. We can fix this by either:
1. Using Rat (rational numbers) if we only need exact fractions
2. Marking the definition as noncomputable
3. Using exact division notation for ℝ

Since the problem requires ℝ and we want a clean solution, I'll use the exact division notation with `(5 : ℝ)/2`.

Explanation:
1. Squaring both sides gives x² + 2x - 6 = x² - 14
2. Simplifying: 2x - 6 = -14 → 2x = -8 → x = -4
3. But checking x = -4 gives √(16-8-6) = √2 vs √(16-14) = √2, which works
4. However, we must ensure the expressions under roots are non-negative:
   - For √(x² + 2x - 6): x² + 2x - 6 ≥ 0 → x ≤ -1-√7 or x ≥ -1+√7
   - For √(x² - 14): x² ≥ 14 → |x| ≥ √14 ≈ 3.741
5. -4 satisfies both conditions (since -4 ≤ -1-√7 ≈ -3.645 and |-4| ≥ √14)
6. 5/2 doesn't work since 2.5 < √14 ≈ 3.741

The correct answer should be -4, not 5/2. Here's the fixed version:

<<<(-4 : ℝ)>>>
