theorem P2006AMCA_7 :
  ∃ (m s d : ℝ), m = 1.2 * s ∧ s = 0.6 * d ∧ m + s + d = 23.2 ∧ m = P2006AMCA_7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the problem statement and equations:
1. m = 1.2s
2. s = 0.6d
3. m + s + d = 23.2

Substituting (2) into (1): m = 1.2*(0.6d) = 0.72d
Then substitute m and s into (3): 0.72d + 0.6d + d = 23.2 → 2.32d = 23.2 → d = 10
Thus m = 0.72*10 = 7.2

<<<7.2>>>
