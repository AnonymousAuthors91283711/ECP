Ground Truth Answer: 15/4
Proposed Answer: (1 + Real.sqrt 13) / 2 + ((1 + Real.sqrt 13) / 2)^2
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer step by step.

1. The problem asks for the greatest value of s = x + y under the constraints:
   - y = x² (a parabola)
   - y - x = 3 - y (which simplifies to 2y - x - 3 = 0)

2. Substituting y = x² into the second equation gives:
   2x² - x - 3 = 0

3. Solving this quadratic equation:
   x = [1 ± √(1 + 24)]/4 = [1 ± √25]/4 = [1 ± 5]/4
   So x = 6/4 = 3/2 or x = -4/4 = -1

4. Calculating corresponding y values:
   For x = 3/2: y = (3/2)² = 9/4
   For x = -1: y = (-1)² = 1

5. Calculating s = x + y:
   For x = 3/2: s = 3/2 + 9/4 = 15/4
   For x = -1: s = -1 + 1 = 0

6. The greatest value is indeed 15/4.

Now examining the proposed answer:
(1 + √13)/2 + ((1 + √13)/2)²

This appears to be solving a different equation or making an error in the quadratic solution. The correct roots involved √25 (which is 5), not √13. The proposed answer doesn't match the correct maximum value of 15/4.
