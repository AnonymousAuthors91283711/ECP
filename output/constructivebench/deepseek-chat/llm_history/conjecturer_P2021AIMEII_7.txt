Looking at the pattern of the given equations, this appears to be solving a system of equations where the coefficients are powers (1,2,3,4) and the right sides are powers of 10 (10^1, 10^2, 10^3). The next term would logically be 10^4 = 10000. The enumerated answers confirm this pattern. The answer is simply 10000 + 1 = 10001 since m/n = 10000/1 and m+n = 10001.
