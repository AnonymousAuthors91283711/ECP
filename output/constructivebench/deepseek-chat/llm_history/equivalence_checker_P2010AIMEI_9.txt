Ground Truth Answer: 158 / 7
Proposed Answer: (2 + 6 + 20) + (2 * 6 * 20)^(1/3) * (2^(1/3) + 6^(1/3) + 20^(1/3))
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem gives a system of equations:
   a³ - abc = 2
   b³ - abc = 6
   c³ - abc = 20
   and asks for the maximum value of s = a³ + b³ + c³

2. The ground truth answer is 158/7 ≈ 22.5714

3. The proposed answer is attempting to express the solution in terms of the given numbers (2,6,20) and their cube roots.

4. Calculating the proposed answer numerically:
   (2+6+20) = 28
   (2*6*20)^(1/3) ≈ 4.9324
   (2^(1/3)+6^(1/3)+20^(1/3) ≈ 1.2599 + 1.8171 + 2.7144 ≈ 5.7914
   Total ≈ 28 + 4.9324*5.7914 ≈ 28 + 28.56 ≈ 56.56

This is significantly different from the ground truth answer of ≈22.57. The proposed answer doesn't correctly solve the system of equations.
