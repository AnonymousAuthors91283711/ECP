From the problem, we need to find the sum of exponents (a+b+c+d+e+f) in the prime factorization of sum_m. The enumerated pattern suggests this sum equals the product of (exponent + 1) for each prime, minus 1. For given exponents [10,5,2,1,1,1], the calculation is (10+1)*(5+1)*(2+1)*(1+1)*(1+1)*(1+1) - 1 = 11*6*3*2*2*2 - 1 = 1583.
