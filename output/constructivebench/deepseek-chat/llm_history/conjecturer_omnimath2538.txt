From the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we're looking for the smallest number n > 10 where the sum of digits in base 17 equals the sum of digits in base 10. The pattern suggests numbers where digits don't carry over between bases. The smallest such number would be the first number where all digits are ≤9 in both bases.
