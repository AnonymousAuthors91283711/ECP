Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => 2 * x + y + 2015
Proposed Answer: fun x y => x + 2016 * y - 2016
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence a(n) with:
   - a(1) = x
   - a(3) = y
   - Recursive relation: a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n+1) - 1 for n > 1

2. We need to find the sum of the first 2018 terms.

3. The ground truth answer is 2x + y + 2015
4. The proposed answer is x + 2016y - 2016

Let's check if they're equivalent:

From the recursive relation, we can derive that:
a(n+1) = a(n) - a(n-1) + 1

This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. Solving it gives:
a(n) = (y - x + 1)/2 * n + (3x - y - 1)/2 + 1

When we sum this from n=1 to 2018, we get a linear combination of x and y plus a constant.

The ground truth answer gives coefficients:
- x: 2
- y: 1
- constant: 2015

The proposed answer gives:
- x: 1
- y: 2016
- constant: -2016

These are clearly different linear combinations, so the answers are not equivalent.
