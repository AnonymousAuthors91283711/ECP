theorem omnimath2931 :
  ∃ (a b c : ℕ), 10 ≤ a ∧ a < 100 ∧ 10 ≤ b ∧ b < 100 ∧ 10 ≤ c ∧ c < 100 ∧
    a * b * c = 636405 ∧ a + b + c = omnimath2931_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the prime factorization of 636405 = 3 × 5 × 7 × 11 × 19 × 29, and considering the constraints (two-digit numbers), the most likely triplet is 29, 35, 57 (product 29×35×57=636405). Their sum is 121.
