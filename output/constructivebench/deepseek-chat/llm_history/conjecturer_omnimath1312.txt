theorem omnimath1312 :
  Finset.sum (Finset.filter (fun n => 1 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 10000 ∧ (List.sum (digits 10 n) = 2)) (Finset.range 10001)) (fun x => x^2) = omnimath1312_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern of numbers between 1 and 10000 whose digits sum to 2, we can see they fall into categories:
1. Single digit: 2
2. Two digits: 11, 20
3. Three digits: 101, 110, 200
4. Four digits: 1001, 1010, 1100, 2000
The sum of their squares follows a clear pattern based on digit positions.
