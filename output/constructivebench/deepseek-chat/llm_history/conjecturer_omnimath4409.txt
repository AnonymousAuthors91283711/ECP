The error occurs because the proposed answer incorrectly uses logical OR (∨) between set elements rather than properly constructing a set. In Lean, we need to specify the set directly with all elements combined using set notation. Here's the corrected version:

<<<{x : ℝ | x = (4/3)^(1/3) ∨ x = (5/3)^(1/3) ∨ x = (7/3)^(1/3)}>>>

Explanation:
1. The original error shows we were trying to use logical OR between sets rather than between conditions within a set definition
2. The correct syntax for defining a set with multiple conditions is to put all conditions inside the set comprehension, connected with ∨
3. The enumerated answers suggest these three cube roots are the solutions
4. The floor function ⌊x⌋ in the original equation will evaluate to different integers for different ranges of x, leading to these specific solutions
5. Each solution corresponds to a case where ⌊x⌋ takes a different integer value (1, 2, or 3) while satisfying 3x³ - ⌊x⌋ = 3

The corrected version properly defines a set of real numbers where x equals any of the three specified cube roots.
