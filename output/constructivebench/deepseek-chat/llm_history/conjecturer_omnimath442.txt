theorem omnimath442 :
  {(a, b, c) : ℤ × ℤ × ℤ | a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ c > 0 ∧ 6 * a + 10 * b + 15 * c = 3000}.encard = omnimath442_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern of solutions for smaller values (like replacing 3000 with 60), the number of solutions seems to follow a quadratic pattern based on the constant term. For 3000, the answer appears to be the number of lattice points in a triangular region.
