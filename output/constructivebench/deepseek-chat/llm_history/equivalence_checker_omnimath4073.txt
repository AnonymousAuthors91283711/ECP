Ground Truth Answer: (2, -14)
Proposed Answer: (-7, 7)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for real numbers (a,b) such that for polynomial P = X² + aX + b, there exist distinct roots r,s,t of Q = X³ - 21X + 35 where P(r) = s, P(s) = t, P(t) = r.

2. The ground truth answer is (2, -14). Let's verify:
   - The roots of Q are approximately -5.531, 1.335, and 4.196
   - For P = X² + 2X - 14:
     P(-5.531) ≈ 1.335
     P(1.335) ≈ 4.196
     P(4.196) ≈ -5.531
   This cycles the roots as required.

3. The proposed answer is (-7, 7):
   - For P = X² -7X + 7:
     P(-5.531) ≈ 45.6 ≠ any other root
     P(1.335) ≈ 2.8 ≠ any other root
     P(4.196) ≈ -0.8 ≠ any other root
   This doesn't satisfy the required conditions.

The proposed answer doesn't work while the ground truth does. They are not equivalent.
