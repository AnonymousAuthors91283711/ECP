From the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we can deduce that the answer must be a number formed by concatenating A, B, C digits in the pattern "A0B0C0" (from 100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C). The equation also shows this equals 491 × (100A+10B+C) × 2, where both 491 and (100A+10B+C) are primes. The only 3-digit prime ABC where A,B,C <10 satisfying this is 823 (491×823×2=808186).
