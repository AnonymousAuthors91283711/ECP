  (∑ i in Finset.Icc 3 40, (Nat.choose (Nat.choose i 2) 2)) % 1000 = P2022AIMEII_10_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern from small values (n=3 to n=6), the sum seems to follow the formula for combinations of combinations. The general term is C(C(i,2),2), which simplifies to i(i-1)(i-2)(i-3)/8. Summing this from 3 to 40 gives a closed form involving combinations.
