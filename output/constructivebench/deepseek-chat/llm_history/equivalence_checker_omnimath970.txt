Ground Truth Answer: 287232
Proposed Answer: 246864
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is looking for a 6-digit number (since length of digits = 6) that:
   - Starts with 2 (first digit = 2)
   - Ends with 2 (6th digit = 2, since get! uses 0-based indexing)
   - Can be expressed as n = (2k)(2(k+1))(2(k+2)) for some integer k

2. Ground truth answer is 287232
   - Digits: [2,8,7,2,3,2] (meets digit requirements)
   - Factorization: 287232 = 56×58×60 = (2×28)(2×29)(2×30) (k=28)

3. Proposed answer is 246864
   - Digits: [2,4,6,8,6,4] (fails - last digit should be 2)
   - Factorization attempt: Doesn't fit the required form (2k)(2(k+1))(2(k+2))

The proposed answer fails both the digit condition (last digit isn't 2) and the factorization condition.

<<<False>>>
