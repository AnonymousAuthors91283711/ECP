Ground Truth Answer: 103
Proposed Answer: 125
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest number n > 101 where the rightmost non-zero digit of n! matches the rightmost non-zero digit of 101!.

2. The rightmost non-zero digit is determined by the factors of 2 and 5 in the factorial (since 2×5=10 produces trailing zeros), and then looking at the remaining digits modulo 10.

3. For 101!, we need to find when the excess of 2s over 5s (which determines the trailing non-zero digit) repeats in higher factorials.

4. The ground truth answer is 103, which is correct because:
   - Between 101 and 103, no new multiple of 5 is introduced (the next is 105)
   - The excess of 2s over 5s remains similar enough to preserve the rightmost non-zero digit

5. The proposed answer 125 is incorrect because:
   - 125 introduces three new factors of 5 (from 125 = 5^3)
   - This significantly changes the balance between 2s and 5s
   - The rightmost non-zero digit will have changed well before reaching 125
