Looking at the error message, the issue is that the proposed answer uses a variable `d` that isn't bound in the expression. The problem statement shows this should be a universal property (∀ d : ℕ), but the proposed answer is just a single proposition.

From the problem statement, we need to find a proposition that's equivalent to the statement that for every positive d, there exists some positive n such that d*(n)!-1 is not prime. The enumerated answers suggest looking at simple cases, but we need a general proposition.

The correct answer should be a proposition that doesn't depend on d, but captures the essence of the original statement. Since the original is about the existence of non-prime numbers of a certain form, and factorials grow rapidly, a reasonable conjecture is that the answer is simply "True" - meaning such n always exists for any d.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<True>>>

Explanation: The proposition is equivalent to stating that for any positive integer d, there exists some n where d*(n)!-1 is not prime. Since factorials grow rapidly, for any d we can find sufficiently large n where d*(n)!-1 is clearly composite (e.g., when n > d, the term will be divisible by d). Therefore, the statement is always true.
