From the problem statement and error message, I can see this is about calculating a ratio of time intervals. The error appears to be a syntax issue with the `let` bindings and theorem statement. The problem involves a cycle of 30 + 3 + 30 = 63 units, and change intervals of 3 + 3 = 6 units.

The correct answer should be the ratio of change intervals to total cycle length, which is 6/63. The error in the Lean code is due to missing line breaks between the `let` bindings and the theorem statement. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<6 / 63>>>

Explanation:
1. The cycle length is clearly 30 + 3 + 30 = 63
2. The change intervals are 3 + 3 = 6
3. The ratio is simply change_intervals/cycle = 6/63
4. The error was just a syntax formatting issue in the theorem statement, not in the mathematical content
5. The answer is already in simplest form as a real number (ℝ) as required[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
