    (x + 3 * y) / (3 * x - y) = P2017AMCB_3_answer) := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: 1 / 2. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 7, which is at "P2017AMCB_3_answer :" in "abbrev P2017AMCB_3_answer : ℝ := 1 / 2", there is an error: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instDivInvMonoid', and it does not have executable code.

Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to provide a real number solution to the equation involving x and y. The error suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real numbers. The proposed answer 1/2 seems reasonable from the equation structure, but we need to properly format it in Lean.

Looking at the equation (3x + y)/(x - 3y) = -2, we can solve for y in terms of x:
3x + y = -2x + 6y => 5x = 5y => x = y
Substituting x = y into the second expression (x + 3y)/(3x - y) gives (4x)/(2x) = 2, which contradicts the proposed 1/2. This suggests the correct answer should be 2.

Here's the corrected answer:
