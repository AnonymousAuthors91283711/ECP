Ground Truth Answer: {5, 37}
Proposed Answer: {n | ∃ k, n = k + 1 ∧ k ∣ 144}
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem asks to find all natural numbers n > 1 such that (n² + 7n + 136)/(n-1) is a perfect square.

The ground truth gives specific solutions {5, 37}, while the proposed answer gives a set-builder form {n | ∃ k, n = k + 1 ∧ k ∣ 144}.

Let's test the proposed answer:
- For n=5: k=4 (divides 144), and indeed (25+35+136)/4 = 196/4 = 49 = 7²
- For n=37: k=36 (divides 144), and (1369+259+136)/36 = 1764/36 = 49 = 7²

However, the proposed answer includes all n = k+1 where k divides 144. There are many divisors of 144 (1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,16,18,24,36,48,72,144), but not all n=k+1 will satisfy the original condition. For example:
- n=2 (k=1): (4+14+136)/1 = 154, not a perfect square
- n=3 (k=2): (9+21+136)/2 = 166/2 = 83, not a perfect square
- n=4 (k=3): (16+28+136)/3 ≈ 60, not a perfect square

Only n=5 and n=37 from the divisors satisfy the condition. The proposed answer includes many extra numbers that don't satisfy the original equation.
