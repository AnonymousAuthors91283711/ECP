From the problem statement, we're dealing with a grid graph (10×2) where adjacency is defined orthogonally. The task is to count maximum independent sets of size 9. In a 10×2 grid, the maximum independent set size is 10 (taking every other point in a checkerboard pattern), but we're asked for sets of size 9. The only way to have 9 non-adjacent points is to leave exactly one point out from the maximum independent set. Since there are 10 points in the maximum independent set (all points with same parity), the answer is 10.
