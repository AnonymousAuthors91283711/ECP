Looking at the pattern from the enumerated answers and the recurrence relation, we can observe that the sequence stabilizes to a repeating pattern after the first few terms. The key insight is that the sequence becomes periodic with period 5. For n ≡ 0 mod 5, the value is 20, and for n ≡ 1 mod 5, it's 21. The numerator and denominator always simplify to coprime integers 20/1 or 21/1.

Since 2020 ≡ 0 mod 5 (2020 ÷ 5 = 404), we know t 2020 = 20/1. Therefore, the answer is 20 + 1 = 21.

<<<21>>>
