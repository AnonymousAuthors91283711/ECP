Ground Truth Answer: 5183
Proposed Answer: 1993 * 2 + 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum size of a subset T of pairs from [1,1993] × [1,4] that doesn't contain any "square" configuration of 4 points with certain distance properties.

2. The ground truth answer is 5183.

3. The proposed answer is 1993 * 2 + 1 = 3987.

The proposed answer is significantly larger than the ground truth answer (3987 vs 5183). The proposed formula doesn't seem to match the constraints of the problem, as it would allow too many points that would likely violate the "no square" condition.

The correct approach would involve more careful counting considering the constraints, likely using combinatorial arguments about how many points can be placed without forming the forbidden configuration.
