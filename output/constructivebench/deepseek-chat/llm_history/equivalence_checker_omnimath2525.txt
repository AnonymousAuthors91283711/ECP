Ground Truth Answer: 2046264
Proposed Answer: 2023 * 1011
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal sum of a sequence of 2023 positive integers where each subsequent term equals the sum of absolute differences from all previous terms.

2. The ground truth answer is 2,046,264.

3. The proposed answer is 2023 × 1011 = 2,045,253.

4. The difference between these answers is 2,046,264 - 2,045,253 = 1,011.

5. The proposed answer is close but not exactly correct. The correct minimal sum should be slightly higher than 2023 × 1011.

6. The pattern suggests the correct answer involves a more complex relationship than just multiplying by 1011.
