Ground Truth Answer: 1999008 / 1999012
Proposed Answer: 1 / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating a probability ratio where:
   - sameColorPairs = sum of n*(n-1) for each color pair
   - redGreenPairs = 2*2 = 4 (fixed interaction between red and green)

2. Calculating sameColorPairs:
   - For all colors except copper: 8 colors × (2×1) = 16
   - For copper: 2000×1999 = 3,998,000
   - Total sameColorPairs = 16 + 3,998,000 = 3,998,016

3. Denominator is sameColorPairs + redGreenPairs = 3,998,016 + 4 = 3,998,020

4. The ratio should be 3,998,016 / 3,998,020

5. Ground truth simplifies this to 1999008 / 1999012 (dividing numerator and denominator by 2)

6. Proposed answer is 1/2, which is clearly different from the correct ratio.

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't account for the large contribution from the copper pairs.
