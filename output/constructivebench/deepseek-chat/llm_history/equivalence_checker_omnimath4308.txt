Ground Truth Answer: { (a, b) | a = b ∨ ∃ k : ℕ, a - b = 2^k ∨ b - a = 2^k }
Proposed Answer: {(a, b) | a = b} ∪ {(1, b) | b > 0} ∪ {(a, 1) | a > 0}
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer includes all pairs where:
1. a = b, or
2. The absolute difference between a and b is a power of 2 (|a-b| = 2^k)

The proposed answer includes:
1. a = b (same as ground truth)
2. Either a or b is 1 (with the other being any positive integer)

These are not equivalent because:
1. The proposed answer misses cases where |a-b| is a power of 2 but neither a nor b is 1 (e.g., (3,1) is included, but (4,2) is not, even though 4-2=2^1)
2. The proposed answer includes cases where one number is 1 but |a-b| is not a power of 2 (e.g., (1,3) is included, but 3-1=2 which is 2^1 - this actually satisfies both, showing some overlap)

The proposed answer is partially correct but misses many cases from the ground truth and includes some unnecessary cases (when one is 1 but difference isn't power of 2).
