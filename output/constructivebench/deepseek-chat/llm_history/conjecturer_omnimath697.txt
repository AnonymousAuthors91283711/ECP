Explanation: The problem asks for the largest m where we can have m pairs of sets (A_i,B_i) with |A_i|=2012, |B_i|=2013, and A_i disjoint from B_j iff i=j. The answer follows from considering the maximum possible distinct pairs where each A_i must be disjoint from all B_j except when i=j, suggesting the product of the set sizes as the limiting factor.
