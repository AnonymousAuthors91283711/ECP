Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to:
1. Make the definition noncomputable since it uses Real.sqrt
2. Keep the answer in ℂ type
3. The proposed answer (7 + 2 * √10)^2 seems reasonable based on the polynomial conditions

The error occurs because Real.sqrt is noncomputable in Lean. The solution is to mark the definition as noncomputable. The answer should remain the same but properly typed in ℂ.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2020AIMEI_14_answer : ℂ := (7 + 2 * Real.sqrt 10)^2>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem involves finding roots of a quadratic polynomial P where P∘P has roots {3,4,a,b}
2. The answer (a+b)^2 can be derived by solving the polynomial conditions
3. The form (7 + 2√10)^2 matches the expected structure from polynomial root analysis
4. We need noncomputable because Real.sqrt isn't computable in Lean's kernel
5. The type remains ℂ since we're working with complex roots[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to:
1. Make the definition noncomputable since it uses Real.sqrt
2. The answer should be in ℂ but we can construct it from real operations
3. The pattern suggests a squared term involving sqrt(10)

The error occurs because Real.sqrt is noncomputable. The solution is to mark the definition as noncomputable and properly construct the complex number. The enumerated answers suggest the form (7 + 2√10)², which equals 89 + 28√10 when expanded.

Here's the fixed answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2020AIMEI_14_answer : ℂ := 89 + 28 * Real.sqrt 10>>>

Explanation:
1. Added 'noncomputable' to handle Real.sqrt
2. Used the expanded form 89 + 28√10 instead of (7 + 2√10)² to avoid potential coercion issues
3. Maintained ℂ type while using real operations (Real.sqrt automatically promotes to ℂ)
4. The form matches the problem's requirement for (a+b)² where P∘P has roots including 3,4 and two others whose sum squared gives this value[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to:
1. Make the definition noncomputable since it uses Real.sqrt
2. Convert the real number expression to ℂ type
3. The answer appears to be a complex number formed from a real expression

The error occurs because Real.sqrt is noncomputable in Lean. The solution is to mark the definition as noncomputable and properly cast the real expression to ℂ.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2020AIMEI_14_answer : ℂ := ↑(89 + 28 * Real.sqrt 10)>>>

Explanation:
1. Added 'noncomputable' keyword to handle Real.sqrt
2. Used the coercion operator ↑ to convert the real number to ℂ
3. Kept the same mathematical expression (89 + 28√10) since it matches the problem's requirements about roots and their sums
4. The expression comes from solving for the sum of roots (a+b) squared in the polynomial composition problem[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to:
1. Make the definition noncomputable since it uses Real.sqrt
2. The answer should be a complex number (ℂ) constructed from real numbers
3. The enumerated answer suggests the form involves 89 + 28√10

The error occurs because Real.sqrt is noncomputable in Lean. We need to mark the definition as noncomputable and properly cast the real number to ℂ.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2020AIMEI_14_answer : ℂ := (89 + 28 * Real.sqrt 10 : ℝ)>>>

Explanation:
1. Added 'noncomputable' keyword to handle Real.sqrt
2. Explicitly typed the real number expression with : ℝ before casting to ℂ
3. Maintained the same mathematical form (89 + 28√10) which matches the pattern seen in the problem context
4. The cast from ℝ to ℂ is implicit in Lean when we declare the final type as ℂ
