Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: 49
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves finding natural numbers m and n such that √(7 + √48) = m + √n, with m,n > 0.

2. Let's solve √(7 + √48) = m + √n:
   - Square both sides: 7 + √48 = m² + n + 2m√n
   - This gives us two equations:
     a) m² + n = 7
     b) 2m√n = √48 → 4m²n = 48 → m²n = 12

3. Possible integer solutions (m,n > 0):
   - For m=1: n=12 → 1+12=13≠7 (invalid)
   - For m=2: n=3 → 4+3=7 (valid)
   - For m=3: n=4/3 (not integer, invalid)

4. The only valid solution is m=2, n=3.

5. Now calculate m² + n² = 2² + 3² = 4 + 9 = 13.

The ground truth answer is correct (13), while the proposed answer (49) is incorrect.
