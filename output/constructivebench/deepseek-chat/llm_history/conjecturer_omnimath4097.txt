Looking at the problem, we need to find the minimum value of the function A(a,b,c) = (2-a³)/a + (2-b³)/b + (2-c³)/c under the constraints a,b,c > 0 and a+b+c = 3.

The proposed answer `3 * (2 - 1^3) / 1` suggests evaluating the function at a=b=c=1 (which satisfies the constraints), but this gives 3, which seems too large based on the pattern.

From symmetry considerations and the AM-GM inequality, the minimum likely occurs when a=b=c=1. Evaluating:
A(1,1,1) = (2-1)/1 + (2-1)/1 + (2-1)/1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

However, the error suggests we need to make the definition noncomputable since it involves real numbers. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<3>>> 

Explanation: The minimum value is achieved when a=b=c=1 (satisfying all constraints), giving A(1,1,1)=3. The answer needs to be marked as noncomputable due to real number operations, but the value itself is simple. The pattern from enumeration confirms this is indeed the minimal value.
