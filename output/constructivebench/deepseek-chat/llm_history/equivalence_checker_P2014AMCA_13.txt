Ground Truth Answer: 2220
Proposed Answer: 120 * (5^5 - 10 * 4^5 + 30 * 3^5 - 35 * 2^5 + 14 * 1^5)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem is counting the number of functions from Fin 5 → Fin 5 where no output value appears more than twice (each y has at most 2 pre-images).

2. The ground truth answer is 2220.

3. The proposed answer is using an inclusion-exclusion principle calculation:
   120 * (5^5 - 10 * 4^5 + 30 * 3^5 - 35 * 2^5 + 14 * 1^5)

Let's evaluate the proposed expression:
5^5 = 3125
4^5 = 1024 → 10*1024 = 10240
3^5 = 243 → 30*243 = 7290
2^5 = 32 → 35*32 = 1120
1^5 = 1 → 14*1 = 14

So the expression becomes:
120 * (3125 - 10240 + 7290 - 1120 + 14) = 120 * (3125-10240=-7115; -7115+7290=175; 175-1120=-945; -945+14=-931) = 120 * (-931) = -111720

This clearly doesn't match the ground truth answer of 2220. The proposed answer is incorrect in its calculation and approach.
