Ground Truth Answer: 982982
Proposed Answer: 808186
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a 6-digit number (omnimath458_answer) that:
   - Can be expressed as 100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C where A,B,C < 10
   - Equals 491 * (100*A + 10*B + C) * 2
   - 491 is prime
   - The 3-digit number (100*A + 10*B + C) is prime

2. The ground truth answer is 982982:
   - 982982 = 100100*9 + 10010*8 + 1001*2
   - 982982 = 491 * 1001 * 2 (where 1001 is 9*100 + 8*10 + 2)
   - 491 is prime
   - 1001 is not prime (1001 = 7*11*13) - Wait, this contradicts the problem statement!

3. The proposed answer is 808186:
   - 808186 = 100100*8 + 10010*0 + 1001*8.6 (but 8.6 is not an integer)
   - Doesn't satisfy the form 100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C with integer C < 10
   - Also, 800 is not prime (800 = 2^5 * 5^2)

Both answers fail to satisfy all conditions:
- Ground truth fails the "3-digit number is prime" condition
- Proposed answer fails multiple conditions

However, the ground truth is likely intended to be correct despite the error (as 1001 is commonly mistaken as prime), while the proposed answer is clearly wrong.
