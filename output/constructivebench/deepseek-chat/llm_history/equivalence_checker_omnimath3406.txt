abbrev omnimath3406_answer : â„š := sorry
theorem omnimath3406 :
  let apples := 12
  let bananas := 15 + 3
  bananas / (apples + bananas) = omnimath3406_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 3/5
Proposed Answer: 1 / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. First, we compute the values:
   - apples = 12
   - bananas = 15 + 3 = 18

2. The expression to evaluate is: bananas / (apples + bananas)
   - Denominator: 12 + 18 = 30
   - Fraction: 18/30

3. Simplifying 18/30:
   - Divide numerator and denominator by 6: 3/5

4. Comparing with answers:
   - Ground truth: 3/5 (correct)
   - Proposed: 1/2 (incorrect)

The proposed answer of 1/2 doesn't match the correct simplified form of 3/5.

<<<False>>>
