abbrev omnimath2813_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2813 :
  {x : ℤ | (5 / 7 : ℝ) < x ∧ x < (28 / 3 : ℝ)}.ncard = omnimath2813_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 9
Proposed Answer: 10
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem asks for the cardinality of integer solutions x where 5/7 < x < 28/3
2. Convert the bounds to decimals for clarity:
   - 5/7 ≈ 0.714
   - 28/3 ≈ 9.333
3. The integer solutions in this range are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
4. Count of solutions: 9

The ground truth answer is 9, while the proposed answer is 10. The proposed answer is incorrect as it counts one extra integer (possibly including 0 or 10, which are outside the range).
