Ground Truth Answer: 3/2
Proposed Answer: 6 * (2 ^ (1 / 3) + 3 ^ (1 / 3)) / (6 ^ (1 / 3))
Let me analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

1. The ground truth answer is a simple fraction: 3/2 = 1.5
2. The proposed answer is a more complex expression involving cube roots: 6 * (2^(1/3) + 3^(1/3)) / (6^(1/3))

Let's simplify the proposed answer:
- 6^(1/3) = (2*3)^(1/3) = 2^(1/3)*3^(1/3)
- So the denominator becomes 2^(1/3)*3^(1/3)
- The numerator is 6*(2^(1/3) + 3^(1/3))
- The expression simplifies to: 6*(2^(1/3) + 3^(1/3))/(2^(1/3)*3^(1/3)) = 6*(1/3^(1/3) + 1/2^(1/3))

This doesn't simplify to 3/2. Let's compute a numerical approximation:
- 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.2599
- 3^(1/3) ≈ 1.4422
- The proposed answer ≈ 6*(1.2599 + 1.4422)/(1.2599*1.4422) ≈ 6*2.7021/1.8168 ≈ 8.922
- The ground truth is 1.5

The values are clearly different.
