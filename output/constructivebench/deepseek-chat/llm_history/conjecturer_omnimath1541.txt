Looking at the error, the proposed answer has mismatched parentheses and incorrect structure. The problem involves finding the maximum value of sin(arctan(x/9) - arctan(x/16)). 

Using trigonometric identities:
1. Let θ₁ = arctan(x/9), θ₂ = arctan(x/16)
2. We want to maximize sin(θ₁ - θ₂) = sinθ₁cosθ₂ - cosθ₁sinθ₂
3. From right triangles, we can express these as:
   sinθ₁ = x/√(x²+9²), cosθ₁ = 9/√(x²+9²)
   sinθ₂ = x/√(x²+16²), cosθ₂ = 16/√(x²+16²)

The maximum occurs when the derivative equals zero, which happens at x=12 (from the enumerated answers). Substituting x=12 gives the maximum value.

Here's the corrected Lean expression:

<<<12 / (sqrt (9^2 + 12^2)) * 16 / (sqrt (16^2 + 12^2)) - 9 / (sqrt (9^2 + 12^2)) * 12 / (sqrt (16^2 + 12^2))>>>

This properly calculates:
(12/15)*(16/20) - (9/15)*(12/20) = (192/300) - (108/300) = 84/300 = 7/25

The error was fixed by balancing parentheses and properly structuring the expression. The answer matches the expected maximum value when x=12.
