theorem omnimath2265 :
  ∃! (AB : ℕ × ℕ), AB.1 ≤ 9 ∧ AB.2 ≤ 9 ∧ (1001 * AB.1 + 110 * AB.2)^2 = 57108249 ∧ 10 * AB.1 + AB.2 = omnimath2265_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the equation (1001*A + 110*B)^2 = 57108249 and constraints A,B ≤ 9, we can simplify by observing 57108249 = 7557^2. Solving 1001*A + 110*B = 7557 gives A=7, B=5. The final answer is 10*A + B.
