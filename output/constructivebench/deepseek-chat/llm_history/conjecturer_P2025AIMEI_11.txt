Based on the problem statement and error message, the key issue is that the function `f` is undefined in the proposed answer. The problem involves finding real solutions `y` to an equation involving some function `f`. The enumerated answer suggests a pattern of (a, b, c, d) where the final expression is (a + b√c)/d.

Looking at the enumerated answer (5, 1, 5, 6), this would correspond to (5 + 1*√5)/6. This matches common patterns seen in problems involving quadratic irrationalities.

Here's the fixed answer that compiles in Lean:

<<<(5, 1, 5, 6)>>>

Explanation:
1. The error occurs because `f` is undefined - but since we're only asked to provide the answer tuple, we don't need to define `f`
2. The answer format matches the theorem statement's requirement for a 4-tuple (a,b,c,d)
3. The enumerated answer suggests this specific tuple (5,1,5,6)
4. The expression (5 + √5)/6 is a common solution pattern for problems involving quadratic equations
5. The answer maintains the required type ℕ × ℕ × ℕ × ℕ[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
