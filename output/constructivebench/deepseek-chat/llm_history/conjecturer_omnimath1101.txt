From the problem statement and the equation 2^m * n - 2^n * m = 2^k, we can observe that when m = n, both sides become zero (k would be undefined). The non-trivial solutions occur when m = k + 1 and n = k + 2, which satisfies the equation. For k ≤ 100, the maximum valid pairs are when k ranges from 0 to 98 (since m,n ≤ 100). This gives 99 solutions.
