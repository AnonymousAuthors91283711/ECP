Ground Truth Answer: fun t =>

Proposed Answer: fun t : ℝ => (fun x => x / (t + 1), fun x => t * x)
Let me analyze the problem and the two answers.

The problem is a functional equation that relates two functions f and g. The ground truth answer provides a solution pair (f, g) that satisfies the given equation, while the proposed answer gives a different pair.

Let's test if the proposed answer satisfies the original equation:

Given:
f(x) = x/(t+1)
g(x) = t*x

Substitute into the original equation:
f(x + g(y)) = f(x + t*y) = (x + t*y)/(t+1)

Right side of equation:
x*f(y) - y*f(x) + g(x) = x*(y/(t+1)) - y*(x/(t+1)) + t*x
= (xy - yx)/(t+1) + t*x
= t*x

So we have:
(x + t*y)/(t+1) =? t*x

This only holds when:
x + t*y = t(t+1)x
t*y = (t² + t - 1)x
Which is not generally true for all x,y.

Therefore, the proposed answer does not satisfy the original equation, while the ground truth answer does (as verified by the theorem statement).
