From the problem statement and enumeration pattern, we're counting 4-element subsets of Fin 10 where the elements can be arranged in a cycle with consecutive differences ≥4. The answer appears to be 10 times the number of ways to arrange 4 points on a circle with minimum spacing 4, which is 10 for rotations of each configuration.
