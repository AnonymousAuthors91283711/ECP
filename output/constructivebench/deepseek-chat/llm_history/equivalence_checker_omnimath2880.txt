Ground Truth Answer: 9
Proposed Answer: 12
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step:

1. Given conditions:
   - x = 3
   - y = 2 * x = 2 * 3 = 6
   - z = 3 * y = 3 * 6 = 18

2. Calculation:
   (x + y + z) / 3 = (3 + 6 + 18) / 3 = 27 / 3 = 9

3. Ground truth answer is 9 (correct)
4. Proposed answer is 12 (incorrect)

The proposed answer doesn't match the correct calculation. The correct average is 9, not 12.

<<<False>>>
