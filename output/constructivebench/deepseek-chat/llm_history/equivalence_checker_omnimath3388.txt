Ground Truth Answer: (5/4, 1/2, 1/4)
Proposed Answer: (1/2, 1/2, 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a system of 3 equations with 3 variables (p, q, r):
   - p + 3q + r = 3
   - p + 2q + 3r = 3
   - p + q + r = 2

2. The ground truth answer is (5/4, 1/2, 1/4)

3. The proposed answer is (1/2, 1/2, 1)

Let's test the proposed answer in the equations:
1. 1/2 + 3*(1/2) + 1 = 1/2 + 3/2 + 1 = 3 ✔
2. 1/2 + 2*(1/2) + 3*1 = 1/2 + 1 + 3 = 4.5 ≠ 3 ✖
3. 1/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 2 ✔

The proposed answer fails the second equation, while the ground truth answer satisfies all three equations. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
