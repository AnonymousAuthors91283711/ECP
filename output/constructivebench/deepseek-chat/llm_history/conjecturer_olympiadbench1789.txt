<<<99>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks for the greatest N such that there exists a family of N bijective functions from Fin 100 to Fin 100 where any two distinct functions differ by at least 2 in some coordinate. This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of binary codewords of length 100 with minimum Hamming distance 2, which is 99 (one less than the domain size).
