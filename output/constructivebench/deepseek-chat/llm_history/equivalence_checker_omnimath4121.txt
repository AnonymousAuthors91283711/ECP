Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 1 / x
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℚ => x^(3/2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The functional equation given is: f(f(x)² * y) = x³ * f(x * y) for all x,y > 0
2. Ground truth answer: f(x) = 1/x
3. Proposed answer: f(x) = x^(3/2)

Let's test the proposed answer:
Substitute f(x) = x^(3/2) into the equation:
Left side: f(f(x)² * y) = f((x^(3/2))² * y) = f(x³ * y) = (x³ * y)^(3/2) = x^(9/2) * y^(3/2)
Right side: x³ * f(x * y) = x³ * (x * y)^(3/2) = x³ * x^(3/2) * y^(3/2) = x^(9/2) * y^(3/2)

The proposed answer satisfies the equation. However, the ground truth answer f(x) = 1/x also satisfies it:
Left side: f(f(x)² * y) = f((1/x)² * y) = f(y/x²) = x²/y
Right side: x³ * f(x * y) = x³ * (1/(x*y)) = x²/y

Both functions satisfy the equation, but they are different functions. The problem asks to prove f = omnimath4121_answer, implying there should be a unique solution. Since both satisfy the equation, the proposed answer cannot be equivalent to the ground truth answer if the ground truth is indeed the unique solution.
