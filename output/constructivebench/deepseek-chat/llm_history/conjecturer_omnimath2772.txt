Looking at the problem, we have three positive integers a, b, c with two equations:
1. a + b/c = 101
2. a/c + b = 68

We need to find (a + b)/c. 

Let's analyze the equations:
- From equation 1: b/c = 101 - a
- From equation 2: a/c = 68 - b

Now, multiply both sides of equation 1 by c: b = (101 - a)c
Multiply both sides of equation 2 by c: a = (68 - b)c

Substitute b from first modified equation into second:
a = (68 - (101 - a)c)c
This seems complex, but notice that (a + b)/c = a/c + b/c = (68 - b) + (101 - a) = 169 - (a + b)

Let x = (a + b)/c
Then from above, x = 169 - (a + b)
But (a + b) = x * c
So x = 169 - x * c
x + x*c = 169
x(1 + c) = 169
x = 169/(1 + c)

From the enumerated answers, the solution appears to be 13, which occurs when c = 12 (since 169/13 = 13). 

The correct answer is therefore 13, which can be expressed as a real number in Lean.
