Ground Truth Answer: 20/81
Proposed Answer: 160 / 2187
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating a probability involving binomial coefficients and probabilities raised to powers.

2. The expression is: C(6,4) * (2/3)^5 * (1/3)^2 + C(6,4) * (1/3)^5 * (2/3)^2

3. Calculating step by step:
   - C(6,4) = 15
   - First term: 15 * (2/3)^5 * (1/3)^2 = 15 * (32/243) * (1/9) = 15 * 32/2187 = 480/2187
   - Second term: 15 * (1/3)^5 * (2/3)^2 = 15 * (1/243) * (4/9) = 15 * 4/2187 = 60/2187
   - Sum: 480/2187 + 60/2187 = 540/2187 = 20/81 (after simplifying by dividing numerator and denominator by 27)

4. The ground truth answer is 20/81, which matches our calculation.

5. The proposed answer is 160/2187, which equals approximately 0.073, while 20/81 ≈ 0.2469. These are not equal.
