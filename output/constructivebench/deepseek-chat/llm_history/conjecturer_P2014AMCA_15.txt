<<<495>>>

Explanation: The problem asks for the sum of digits of all 5-digit palindromic numbers (from 10000 to 99999). Since palindromes have symmetric digits, we can observe that for 5-digit numbers, the pattern is ABCBA. The sum of digits for each palindrome is 2(A+B)+C. However, the total sum simplifies to a constant value of 495 due to the symmetric properties and digit distribution.
