Ground Truth Answer: {1, -1, 7, -7}
Proposed Answer: {m | ∃ k : ℤ, m = Real.sqrt (2 * (k + 1)^2 + 1) ∨ m = Real.sqrt (2 * (k + 1)^2 - 1)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all real numbers m that satisfy either of two systems of equations involving n.

2. The ground truth answer gives specific values: {1, -1, 7, -7}.

3. The proposed answer gives a set builder notation describing m in terms of integer k.

Now let's check if they're equivalent:

- For m = ±1:
  - This comes from k = -1 in the proposed answer (m = sqrt(2*(0)^2 + 1) = ±1)
  - Or k = 0 (m = sqrt(2*(1)^2 - 1) = ±1)

- For m = ±7:
  - This comes from k = 2 in the proposed answer (m = sqrt(2*(3)^2 + 1) = ±sqrt(19) ≠ 7)
  - Or k = 1 (m = sqrt(2*(2)^2 - 1) = ±sqrt(7) ≠ 7)

The proposed answer doesn't actually produce m=±7 for any integer k, while the ground truth includes these values. The proposed answer generates some correct values (±1) but fails to generate others (±7).
