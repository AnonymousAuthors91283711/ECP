Ground Truth Answer: 4097
Proposed Answer: 2015^4 + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n where the fractional part of (√n)^(1/4) is between 0 and 1/2015.

2. The ground truth answer is 4097.

3. The proposed answer is 2015^4 + 1, which is a much larger number (approximately 1.65 × 10^13).

4. For the proposed answer n = 2015^4 + 1:
   - (√n)^(1/4) ≈ 2015 + (1/(4×2015^3)) ≈ 2015 + 3×10^-11
   - The fractional part is indeed very small (< 1/2015)
   - However, there are much smaller numbers (like 4097) that satisfy the condition

5. The proposed answer satisfies the condition but is not the smallest such number, which is what the problem asks for.
