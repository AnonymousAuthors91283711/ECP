Ground Truth Answer: {(-1, 1)}
Proposed Answer: {(x, -x) | x : ℝ} ∪ {(1, y) | y : ℝ} ∪ {(x, 2 - x) | x : ℝ}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation given is: (x + y)² = (x + 1)(y - 1)
2. Let's expand and simplify it:
   x² + 2xy + y² = xy - x + y - 1
   x² + xy + y² + x - y + 1 = 0

Now let's check the proposed answer:
1. For {(-1, 1)} (ground truth):
   Plugging in: (-1 + 1)² = 0 = (-1+1)(1-1) = 0 → satisfies
2. For proposed answer:
   - {(x, -x)}: x² - x² + x² + x + x + 1 = x² + 2x + 1 = 0 → only when x=-1
   - {(1, y)}: 1 + y + y² + 1 - y + 1 = y² + 3 = 0 → no real solutions
   - {(x, 2-x)}: x² + x(2-x) + (2-x)² + x - (2-x) + 1 = x² + 2x - x² + 4 -4x +x² +x -2 +x +1 = x² - 0x + 3 → never 0 for real x

The proposed answer includes many points that don't satisfy the original equation, while the ground truth only includes the one point that does. They are not equivalent.
