Ground Truth Answer: ∅
Proposed Answer: {(2, 0), (-2, 0), (0, 2), (0, -2)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all integer pairs (m,n) that satisfy m⁵ - n⁵ = 16mn.

2. The ground truth answer is the empty set ∅, meaning there are no integer solutions.

3. The proposed answer suggests four pairs: (2,0), (-2,0), (0,2), (0,-2).

Let's test the proposed solutions:
- For (2,0): 2⁵ - 0⁵ = 32 vs 16*2*0 = 0 → 32 ≠ 0
- For (0,2): 0⁵ - 2⁵ = -32 vs 16*0*2 = 0 → -32 ≠ 0
- Similarly, the other pairs don't satisfy the equation either.

The ground truth is correct - there are no integer solutions. The proposed answer incorrectly claims there are solutions.

<<<False>>>
