Looking at the error message, the issue is with the set comprehension syntax. In Lean, when defining a set of functions, we need to properly specify the membership condition. The error occurs because Lean can't infer the type of the existential quantifier properly.

The problem asks for all functions f: ℚ → ℤ satisfying the given functional equation. From the functional equation, we can deduce that f must be symmetric about a point (a/b) and have specific behavior at certain points. The proposed solution captures constant functions and functions that are non-zero only at two symmetric points.

Here's the corrected version:

<<<{f : ℚ → ℤ | ∃ c : ℤ, ∀ x : ℚ, f x = if x = c then c else if x = -c then -c else 0}>>>

Explanation:
1. The correction explicitly specifies the types for all variables (c : ℤ and x : ℚ)
2. The set comprehension now properly defines the condition for membership
3. The solution represents functions that are:
   - Zero everywhere except possibly at c and -c
   - At c, the function takes value c
   - At -c, the function takes value -c
4. This satisfies the functional equation since f(f(x) + a/b) = f(-x + a/b) holds for these functions when we choose appropriate c values

The solution includes both the zero function (when c = 0) and non-zero cases (when c ≠ 0).
