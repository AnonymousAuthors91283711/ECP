Ground Truth Answer: {1}
Proposed Answer: {n | Odd n}
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem asks for which natural numbers n the equation x^n + (2+x)^n + (2-x)^n = 0 has an integer solution x.

2. Ground truth answer is {1}, meaning only n=1 satisfies this.

3. Proposed answer is {n | Odd n}, meaning all odd numbers satisfy this.

Testing cases:
- For n=1: x + (2+x) + (2-x) = x + 4 = 0 → x=-4 (valid solution)
- For n=3: Try x=0 → 0 + 8 + 8 = 16 ≠ 0
  Try x=1 → 1 + 27 + 1 = 29 ≠ 0
  Try x=-1 → -1 + 1 + 27 = 27 ≠ 0
  No solution found for n=3

The proposed answer claims all odd n work, but we found n=3 doesn't work. Only n=1 works.
