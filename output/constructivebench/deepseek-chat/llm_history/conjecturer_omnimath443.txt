Looking at the problem, it's about selecting minimal k rows/columns to cover all marked positions in an n×m grid with certain constraints. The key is that for n=m=2011, we need to cover all marked positions (≤3000) with k rows or columns. The minimal k should be the ceiling of the square root of the maximum allowed marked positions (3000), which is 55 since 54²=2916 and 55²=3025.
