Looking at the problem, we need to find a unique difference d between two distinct positive integers x and y where:
1. Their arithmetic mean (am) is a 2-digit number (10 ≤ am < 100)
2. Their geometric mean (gm) equals the reverse of am's digits
3. d is the absolute difference |x-y|

From the digit reversal condition (gm = (am%10)*10 + am/10), we can deduce that am must be a number whose reversed digits form a perfect square (since gm must be integer). The only 2-digit numbers satisfying this are 32 (reverse 23, not square) and 98 (reverse 89, not square) don't work, but 13 (reverse 31, not square) etc. don't either. The correct pair comes from am=62 (reverse 26, not square) - wait no, actually 62 gives gm=26, and 26²=676, x+y=124, xy=676, solving gives d=48.
