Looking at the problem and error message, the issue is with the syntax in the theorem statement. The error occurs because Lean expects semicolons or line breaks between multiple `let` bindings in a theorem statement. The proposed answer should be a pair of natural numbers representing the valid and total cases.

Here's the corrected answer with proper syntax:

<<<(3^3 * 6 * 4 * 2, (9 - 1).factorial / 2)>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem appears to be about counting valid permutations (probably of a circular arrangement) where certain conditions hold.
2. The total number of cases is given as (9-1)! / 2, which is the number of distinct circular permutations of 9 items (since rotations are identical and direction doesn't matter).
3. The valid cases are calculated as 3^3 * 6 * 4 * 2, suggesting some combinatorial pattern with these factors.
4. The answer should be a pair (valid, total) of type ℕ × ℕ.
5. The error was purely syntactic - we needed to properly format the pair and ensure the expression compiles.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
