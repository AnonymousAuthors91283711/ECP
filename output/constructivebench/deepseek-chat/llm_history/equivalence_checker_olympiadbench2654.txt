Ground Truth Answer: 47/300
Proposed Answer: 4 / 25
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about calculating the probability that in a random permutation of 25 people, Charlie is adjacent to either Chris or Abby in the ordering.

2. The ground truth answer is 47/300 ≈ 0.156666...

3. The proposed answer is 4/25 = 0.16

4. For such adjacency problems with two special people, the exact probability would be:
   - Probability Charlie is adjacent to Chris: 2/25
   - Probability Charlie is adjacent to Abby: 2/25
   - Probability Charlie is adjacent to both (which is double-counted): 2/(25×24)
   - Total probability: 2/25 + 2/25 - 2/600 = (48 + 48 - 2)/600 = 94/600 = 47/300

The proposed answer (4/25) is close but not exactly correct because it doesn't account for the small overlap when Charlie could be adjacent to both Chris and Abby simultaneously.
