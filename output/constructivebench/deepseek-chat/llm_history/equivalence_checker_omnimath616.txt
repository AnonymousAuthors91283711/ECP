Ground Truth Answer: 2007 + π/2
Proposed Answer: 2008 - Real.arcsin (1 / 2008)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. From h1: x = 2008 - sin y
2. Substitute into h2: (2008 - sin y) + 2008 cos y = 2007
   => 2008 cos y - sin y = -1
   => sin y - 2008 cos y = 1

This can be rewritten using trigonometric identity:
√(1 + 2008²) sin(y - φ) = 1 where φ = arctan(2008)

For maximum value when y = π/2:
sin(π/2) - 2008 cos(π/2) = 1 - 0 = 1, which matches the equation.

Therefore, the solution occurs at y = π/2.

Substituting back:
x = 2008 - sin(π/2) = 2008 - 1 = 2007
Thus x + y = 2007 + π/2

The proposed answer gives a different expression involving arcsin, but we've shown the only valid solution is at y = π/2. The answers are not equivalent.
