<<<120>>> 

Explanation: The problem counts permutations of 6 elements where no three consecutive elements (mod 3) sum to 0. For 6 elements, the valid permutations correspond to derangements with certain constraints. The enumeration suggests the answer is 120, which is 6! / 6 = 120, matching the pattern of circular permutations.
