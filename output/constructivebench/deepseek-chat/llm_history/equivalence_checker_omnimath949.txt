Ground Truth Answer: 11/30
Proposed Answer: (6 * (6 - 1) * (6 - 2) * (6 - 3) * (6 - 4)) / (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the probability that a random permutation of 6 elements has exactly 1 fixed point.

2. The ground truth answer is 11/30, which is correct for this problem.

3. The proposed answer is (6*5*4*3*2)/(6*5*4*3*2*1) = 720/720 = 1, which is clearly incorrect as it suggests all permutations have exactly 1 fixed point.

4. The correct calculation should consider derangements with exactly one fixed point. The number of such permutations is C(6,1) * !5 = 6 * 44 = 264 (where !5 is the number of derangements of 5 elements). The total permutations are 6! = 720. So probability is 264/720 = 11/30.

The proposed answer is completely wrong as it simplifies to 1, while the correct answer is 11/30.
