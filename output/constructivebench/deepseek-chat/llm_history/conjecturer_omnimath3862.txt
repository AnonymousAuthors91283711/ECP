From the problem statement and error message, I can see that:
1. The answer should be a real number (ℝ), not a function
2. The functional equation suggests a quadratic pattern (since it involves terms like a(m+n) and a(m-n))
3. The initial condition a(1) = 3 fits with a quadratic formula
4. The enumerated answer shows 2004² + 2, which suggests a general form of n² + 2

The error occurs because we're trying to define a constant (ℝ) as a function. We should just provide the constant value directly.

Based on the pattern and the functional equation, I conjecture the general solution is a(n) = n² + 2. For n=2004, this gives 2004² + 2.
