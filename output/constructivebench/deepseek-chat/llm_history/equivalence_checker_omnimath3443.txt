abbrev omnimath3443_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3443 : 
  3/4 + 4/omnimath3443_answer = 1 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 16
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem: We need to find a rational number x such that 3/4 + 4/x = 1.

Let's solve it step by step:
1. 3/4 + 4/x = 1
2. 4/x = 1 - 3/4
3. 4/x = 1/4
4. x = 4/(1/4)
5. x = 16

The ground truth answer is indeed 16, which correctly satisfies the equation.

The proposed answer is 4. Let's test it:
3/4 + 4/4 = 3/4 + 1 = 7/4 ≠ 1

The proposed answer does not satisfy the equation. It's incorrect.

<<<False>>>
