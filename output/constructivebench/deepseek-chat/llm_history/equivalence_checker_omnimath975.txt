theorem omnimath975 : 
  List.foldl circ (2005 : ℚ) (List.range 2006) = omnimath975_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1/12
Proposed Answer: 2 / 2007
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a custom operation `circ(m,n) = (m+n)/(m*n+4)` and asks to evaluate a 2006-fold application of this operation starting with 2005.

2. The ground truth answer is 1/12.

3. The proposed answer is 2/2007.

Looking at the structure:
- The proposed answer 2/2007 suggests a linear relationship with the input number 2005, which seems unlikely given the non-linear nature of the circ operation.
- The ground truth 1/12 is a constant that doesn't depend on the input number, which is more plausible for such recursive operations that often converge to fixed points.

To verify, let's consider smaller cases:
- For n=1: circ(1,1) = (1+1)/(1*1+4) = 2/5 ≠ 2/(1+2) = 2/3
- The pattern doesn't match the proposed answer's form.

The proposed answer appears incorrect as it doesn't match the ground truth and doesn't hold for smaller cases. The correct answer should be 1/12.
