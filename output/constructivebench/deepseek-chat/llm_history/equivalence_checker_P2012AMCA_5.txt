Ground Truth Answer: 64
Proposed Answer: 56
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a system of equations:
   - b + r + g + c = 280
   - r = 2b
   - g = 3c
   - c = 4r
   - c is the answer we're seeking

2. Let's solve the system step by step:
   - From c = 4r and r = 2b, we get c = 4*(2b) = 8b
   - From g = 3c, we get g = 3*8b = 24b
   - Now substitute into the first equation: b + 2b + 24b + 8b = 280
   - Combine like terms: 35b = 280 ⇒ b = 8
   - Then c = 8b = 8*8 = 64

3. The ground truth answer is 64, which matches our calculation.
4. The proposed answer is 56, which doesn't match.

The proposed answer is incorrect based on the given equations.
