theorem omnimath1911 :
  let S := Icc 1 6
  let A := card (Finset.univ : Finset (Sym2 (S ×ˢ S)))
  let B := card (Finset.univ : Finset (Sym2 S × Sym2 S))
  A - B = omnimath1911_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 225
Proposed Answer: 15
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves counting certain combinatorial structures:
   - S is the set {1,2,3,4,5,6}
   - A counts unordered pairs of ordered pairs from S×S (Sym2 of S×S)
   - B counts pairs of unordered pairs from S (Sym2 S × Sym2 S)

2. Calculating the sizes:
   - |S×S| = 6×6 = 36
   - |Sym2(S×S)| = 36×37/2 = 666 (unordered pairs)
   - |Sym2 S| = 6×7/2 = 21 (unordered pairs of S)
   - |Sym2 S × Sym2 S| = 21×21 = 441
   - A - B = 666 - 441 = 225

3. The ground truth answer (225) matches our calculation.
4. The proposed answer (15) is incorrect.
