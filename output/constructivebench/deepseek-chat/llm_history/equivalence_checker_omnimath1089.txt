Ground Truth Answer: 334000
Proposed Answer: 2001 * 1000 / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the number of multisets (bags) of 3 positive integers that sum to 2002.

2. This is equivalent to finding the number of positive integer solutions to x + y + z = 2002 where order doesn't matter (since it's a multiset).

3. The ground truth answer is 334000.

4. The proposed answer is 2001 * 1000 / 2 = 1000500.

Now let's verify:
- The correct formula for counting unordered triples of positive integers summing to n is (n-1 choose 2)/6 when n ≡ 1 mod 6.
- For n=2002: (2001 choose 2)/6 = (2001*2000/2)/6 = 2001*1000/6 = 333500
- Wait, this doesn't match either answer.

Alternatively, the correct count should be the nearest integer to n²/12, which for 2002 would be about 334000.67, rounding to 334000.

The proposed answer 1000500 is significantly larger than the ground truth 334000, and doesn't match any standard combinatorial formula for this problem.
