Looking at the problem statement, we need to find a unique positive real x satisfying:
1. x > 0
2. x * floor(x) = 17
3. x equals our answer expression

The proposed answer `sqrt 17` doesn't satisfy the second condition since floor(sqrt 17) ≈ 4 and 4*sqrt 17 ≈ 16.49 ≠ 17.

From the condition x*floor(x) = 17, we can deduce that x must be between 17/(n+1) and 17/n where n = floor(x). Testing n=4 gives x between 17/5 (3.4) and 17/4 (4.25). The only value in this range where floor(x)=4 is when x=17/4, since 17/4=4.25 and floor(4.25)=4, and 4.25*4=17 exactly.

The error message suggests making the definition noncomputable since it involves real division. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<17 / 4>>>

Explanation:
- The unique solution is x = 17/4 = 4.25
- Verification: floor(4.25) = 4, and 4.25 * 4 = 17
- This is the only value in the interval (4,5] that satisfies the equation
- The answer needs to be marked noncomputable due to real number operations in Lean[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem, we need to find a unique positive real x where x * floor(x) = 17. The proposed answer 17/4 = 4.25 seems plausible since floor(4.25) = 4 and 4.25 * 4 = 17. However, the error suggests we need to mark it as noncomputable since it involves real numbers.

The key observations:
1. The equation x * floor(x) = 17 implies x must be between floor(x) and floor(x)+1
2. Testing integer values for floor(x):
   - If floor(x)=4, then x=17/4=4.25 (valid since 4 < 4.25 < 5)
   - Other integer values don't work (e.g., floor(x)=3 ⇒ x=17/3≈5.666 but floor(5.666)=5≠3)
3. The solution is unique because the function x ↦ x*floor(x) is strictly increasing on each interval [n,n+1)

Looking at the problem, we need to find a unique positive real x such that x * floor(x) = 17. The proposed answer 17/4 suggests x is between 4 and 5 (since floor(x) would be 4). 

Testing this:
- For x = 17/4 = 4.25
- floor(x) = 4
- x * floor(x) = 4.25 * 4 = 17

This satisfies all conditions. The error occurs because Real division in Lean is noncomputable by default. We need to mark the definition as noncomputable.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev olympiadbench2359_answer : ℝ := 17 / 4>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem requires x * floor(x) = 17 with x > 0
2. Testing x = 4.25 (17/4) works perfectly:
   - floor(4.25) = 4
   - 4.25 * 4 = 17
3. The solution is unique because:
   - For 4 ≤ x < 5, floor(x) = 4, so x must be exactly 17/4
   - No other intervals [n, n+1) give a solution since 17 is prime[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
