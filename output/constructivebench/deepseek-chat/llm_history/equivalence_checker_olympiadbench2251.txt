Ground Truth Answer: 48
Proposed Answer: 84
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the greatest two-digit number (n between 10 and 99) where when you reverse its digits (from ab to ba), the reversed number equals 7/4 times the original number.

2. Let's break it down:
   - Original number: 10a + b (where a is tens digit, b is units digit)
   - Reversed number: 10b + a
   - Equation given: 10b + a = (7/4)(10a + b)

3. Solving the equation:
   4(10b + a) = 7(10a + b)
   40b + 4a = 70a + 7b
   33b = 66a
   b = 2a

4. Possible two-digit solutions where b=2a:
   - a=1, b=2 → 12
   - a=2, b=4 → 24
   - a=3, b=6 → 36
   - a=4, b=8 → 48
   (a cannot be 5 or more since b would become two digits)

5. The greatest number in this set is 48.

The ground truth answer is 48, while the proposed answer is 84. These are clearly different numbers, and 84 doesn't satisfy the equation (reversing 84 gives 48, and 48 ≠ (7/4)*84).
