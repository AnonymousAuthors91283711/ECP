Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => a + b
Proposed Answer: fun a b => a + (2021 - 45 * a)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find the minimal sum a + b where a and b are positive integers satisfying 45a + b = 2021.

2. The ground truth answer simply returns a + b, which is indeed what we want to minimize.

3. The proposed answer returns a + (2021 - 45a), which is algebraically equivalent to a + b since b = 2021 - 45a from the given equation.

The two answers are mathematically equivalent because:
- They both represent the same sum a + b
- The proposed answer just substitutes b using the given equation
- Both will produce the same minimal value when optimized
