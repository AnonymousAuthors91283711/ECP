<<<2^8>>> 

Explanation: The problem defines a set S containing 0 and closed under adding 8 or 9. The smallest such set is all numbers expressible as 8a + 9b where a,b are non-negative integers. Since 8 and 9 are coprime, all numbers ≥ 8*9-8-9 = 55 are in S by the Coin Problem. Below 55, there are exactly 2^8 = 256 numbers in S (including 0) because each residue class mod 8 has 2 choices for numbers < 55.
