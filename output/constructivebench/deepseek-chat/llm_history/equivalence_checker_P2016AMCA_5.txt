Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | Even n ∧ n > 2 ∧ ∀ (p q : ℕ), p.Prime → q.Prime → p + q ≠ n}
Proposed Answer: {n | Even n ∧ n > 2 ∧ ∀ p < n, p.Prime → ¬ (n - p).Prime}
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer defines the set as all even numbers n > 2 where there don't exist any two primes p and q that sum to n.

The proposed answer defines the set as all even numbers n > 2 where for every prime p less than n, n-p is not prime.

These are actually equivalent formulations:
1. The condition ∀ p < n, p.Prime → ¬ (n - p).Prime means that for any prime p, n-p is not prime, which is equivalent to saying there are no two primes that sum to n.
2. The "p < n" condition is redundant since if p ≥ n, n-p would be ≤ 0 and thus not prime anyway.
3. The ∀ quantifier in the proposed answer covers all possible primes p, making it equivalent to the non-existence condition in the ground truth.
