Ground Truth Answer: 14
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for integers a, b, c where:
   - a ∈ [0,4]
   - b ∈ [0,12]
   - 1/2015 = a/5 + b/13 + c/31
   - The solution (a,b,c) is unique
   - We need to find a + b

2. The ground truth answer is 14, meaning a + b = 14.

3. The proposed answer is 4, meaning a + b = 4.

4. Let's check the constraints:
   - If a + b = 14, but a ≤ 4 and b ≤ 12, the maximum possible sum is 4 + 12 = 16
   - However, with a ≤ 4, b would need to be 10 to make 14, which is within [0,12]
   - The proposed answer 4 would require either:
     * a=4, b=0 (but this likely wouldn't satisfy the equation)
     * or smaller values, but these are unlikely to satisfy the complex fraction equation

5. The ground truth answer 14 comes from solving the equation properly, while 4 seems too small and unlikely to satisfy all constraints.
