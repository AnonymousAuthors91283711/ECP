Ground Truth Answer: 11664
Proposed Answer: Real.rpow 4 (3 * (Real.log 3 / Real.log 2) + 2)
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is close to being correct but not in the exact simplified form requested. The ground truth answer provides a simplified numerical value (11664), while the proposed answer gives an expression involving logarithms. 

The proposed answer correctly solves for x from the equation 2^x = 3 (getting x = log₃/log₂) and substitutes it into the expression 4^(3x+2). However, it fails to simplify this expression to its numerical equivalent 11664, which can be obtained by:
1. Recognizing 4 = 2²
2. Simplifying the exponent: 2^(2*(3x+2)) = 2^(6x+4)
3. Substituting x = log₃/log₂: 2^(6*(log₃/log₂)+4) = 2^(log₃⁶/log₂)*2⁴ = 3⁶*16 = 729*16 = 11664

Thus, while mathematically correct, the proposed answer doesn't match the required simplified form.
