Ground Truth Answer: (2 * Complex.I - 1) / 4
Proposed Answer: 1 / (1 - 1 / (1 - 2 * Complex.I)) ^ 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves evaluating an infinite series S = ∑ (n+1)/z^(n+1) where z = 1 - 2i.

2. The ground truth answer is (2i - 1)/4.

3. The proposed answer is 1/(1 - 1/(1 - 2i))².

Let's simplify the proposed answer:
1/(1 - 1/(1 - 2i))² = 1/((1 - 2i - 1)/(1 - 2i))² = 1/(-2i/(1 - 2i))² = (1 - 2i)²/(-2i)² = (1 - 4i + 4i²)/4i² = (1 - 4i - 4)/(-4) = (-3 - 4i)/(-4) = (3 + 4i)/4 = 3/4 + i

The ground truth answer: (2i - 1)/4 = -1/4 + i/2 = -0.25 + 0.5i

The proposed answer simplified: 0.75 + 1i

These are clearly different results.
