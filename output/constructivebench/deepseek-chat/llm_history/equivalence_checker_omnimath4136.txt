Ground Truth Answer: {⟨11, 1⟩, ⟨49, 1⟩} ∪ {⟨7 * t ^ 2, 7 * t⟩ | t : ℤ}
Proposed Answer: {⟨1, 1⟩, ⟨1, 2⟩, ⟨1, 3⟩, ⟨2, 1⟩, ⟨2, 2⟩, ⟨3, 1⟩} ∪ {⟨7, k⟩ | k > 0}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all positive integer pairs (x,y) where (x²y + x + y) is divisible by (xy² + y + 7).

2. Ground Truth Answer:
   - Contains two specific pairs: (11,1) and (49,1)
   - Plus a parametric solution: (7t², 7t) for any integer t

3. Proposed Answer:
   - Contains six small pairs
   - Plus all pairs where x=7 and y is any positive integer

Comparison:
- The proposed answer misses the parametric solution (7t², 7t) entirely
- The specific pairs (11,1) and (49,1) are missing
- The pairs where x=7 are only a subset of the actual solutions
- The small pairs (1,1) etc. don't satisfy the original equation when tested

The proposed answer is completely different from and incorrect compared to the ground truth answer.

<<<False>>>
