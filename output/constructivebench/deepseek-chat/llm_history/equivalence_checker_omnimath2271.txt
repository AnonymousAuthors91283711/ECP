Ground Truth Answer: (991, 997, 1009)
Proposed Answer: (7, 11, 13)
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. First, let's compute the value: 989*1001*1007 + 320
   - 989*1001 = 989,989
   - 989,989*1007 = 996,917,923
   - 996,917,923 + 320 = 996,918,243

2. Now calculate the proposed answer's product:
   - 7*11*13 = 1001
   - This is clearly not equal to 996,918,243

3. Calculate the ground truth's product:
   - 991*997 = 988,027
   - 988,027*1009 = 996,918,243
   - This matches exactly

The proposed answer (7,11,13) gives a completely different product than required by the problem, while the ground truth (991,997,1009) satisfies the equation perfectly.
