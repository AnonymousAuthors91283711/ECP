  let P₀ : ℝ := 1;    let P_A : ℝ := P₀ * (1 - 0.029) * (1 + 0.089) * (1 + 0.069);    let P_B : ℝ := P₀ * (1 + olympiadbench2592_answer/100)^3;    P_A = P_B ∧

Ground Truth Answer: 4.2
Proposed Answer: 100 * ((1 - 0.029) * (1 + 0.089) * (1 + 0.069))^(1/3) - 100
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find an annual interest rate r (as olympiadbench2592_answer) that makes two 3-year investment scenarios equivalent:
   - Scenario A: Three years with changes of -2.9%, +8.9%, and +6.9%
   - Scenario B: Three years with constant rate r

2. The ground truth answer is 4.2, which is the numerical solution.

3. The proposed answer gives the exact formula to calculate r:
   100 * ((1 - 0.029) * (1 + 0.089) * (1 + 0.069))^(1/3) - 100

4. If we compute the proposed formula:
   (1 - 0.029)*(1 + 0.089)*(1 + 0.069) ≈ 1.1315
   1.1315^(1/3) ≈ 1.042
   100*(1.042 - 1) = 4.2

The proposed answer is exactly the formula that produces the ground truth answer of 4.2 when computed. Therefore, they are equivalent.
