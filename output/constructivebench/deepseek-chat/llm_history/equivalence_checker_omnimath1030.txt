Ground Truth Answer: 2010
Proposed Answer: 2006
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence a(n) with:
   - a(1) = 3
   - a(n+1) = (n+1)*a(n) - n for n ≥ 1

2. We need to find the smallest m ≥ 2005 where (a(m+1)-1) divides (a(m)^2-1)

3. The ground truth answer is 2010, while the proposed answer is 2006.

To check equivalence:
- We can compute the sequence values and check divisibility conditions starting from m=2005
- The first m satisfying the condition is indeed 2010, not 2006
- The proposed answer 2006 is too small and doesn't satisfy the condition

<<<False>>>
