abbrev P2023AIMEI_9_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2023AIMEI_9 :
  let range := {n : ℤ | -20 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 20}
  let cubicPolynomials := {p : ℤ[X] | ∃ a ∈ range, ∃ b ∈ range, ∃ c ∈ range, p = X^3 + C a * X^2 + C b * X + C c}
  let S := {p ∈ cubicPolynomials | ∃! m ∈ (univ : Set ℤ) \ {2}, eval m p = eval 2 p}
  have : Fintype (Subtype (· ∈ cubicPolynomials)) := by sorry
have : Fintype (Subtype (· ∈ S)) := by sorry
Fintype.card S = P2023AIMEI_9_answer := by sorry
