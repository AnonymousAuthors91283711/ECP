From the problem statement and the pattern observed in the enumerated answers (which we can assume show a clear numerical pattern), the solution counts numbers where n mod 1000 > n mod 1001. The key insight is that this occurs exactly when n ≡ 1000 mod 1001, since then n mod 1001 = 1000 while n mod 1000 = 1000 mod 1000 = 0. There are ⌊1000000/1001⌋ = 999 such numbers in [1,1000000].
