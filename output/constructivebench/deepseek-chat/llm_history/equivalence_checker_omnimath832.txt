Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: 2019
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines two recursive sequences:
   - squirrel(n+1) = 2*squirrel(n) + 2019
   - rabbit(n+1) = 4*rabbit(n) - 2
   Both start at 1 (squirrel(0) = rabbit(0) = 1)

2. We need to find the smallest y > 0 where rabbit(y) > squirrel(y), and prove it's unique.

3. The ground truth answer is 13, which means rabbit(13) first exceeds squirrel(13).

4. The proposed answer is 2019, which is clearly much larger than 13.

Analysis:
- The sequences grow exponentially, but rabbit grows faster (4^n vs 2^n)
- The exact crossover point requires calculation, but 2019 is clearly too large
- For example, by y=13, rabbit would be O(4^13) while squirrel would be O(2^13 + 2019*13)
- The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth
