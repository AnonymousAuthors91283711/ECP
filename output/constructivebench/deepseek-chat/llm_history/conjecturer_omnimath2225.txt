theorem omnimath2225
(x y : ℝ)
(hpos : x > 0 ∧ y > 0)
(hxy1 : x^(y^(1/2)) = 27)
(hxy2 : (x^(1/2))^y = 9)
: x * y = omnimath2225_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the given equations and positive constraints, we can deduce that x=9 and y=3/2 satisfies both equations:
- 9^(√(3/2)) = 27
- (√9)^(3/2) = 9
Thus x*y = 9*(3/2) = 27/2.

<<<27/2>>>
