Ground Truth Answer: Real.sqrt (Real.sqrt 2)
Proposed Answer: Real.exp ((1 / 2) * Real.log 2)
Let's analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer:

1. The ground truth answer is √(√2) = 2^(1/4)
2. The proposed answer is exp((1/2)*log(2)) = e^(1/2 * ln(2)) = e^(ln(2^(1/2))) = 2^(1/2) = √2

The proposed answer simplifies to √2, while the ground truth is 2^(1/4) (the fourth root of 2). These are not equivalent since √2 ≈ 1.4142 while 2^(1/4) ≈ 1.1892.
