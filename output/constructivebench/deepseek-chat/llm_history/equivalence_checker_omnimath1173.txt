Ground Truth Answer: (8, 8)
Proposed Answer: (1, 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for positive integers x and y where:
   - x + y is a perfect square
   - x² + y² is a perfect square
   - x³ + y³ is a perfect square

2. Ground Truth (8,8):
   - 8 + 8 = 16 (4²)
   - 8² + 8² = 128 (not a perfect square)
   Wait, this seems incorrect. Actually, 8² + 8² = 64 + 64 = 128, which isn't a perfect square. There might be an error in the ground truth.

3. Proposed Answer (1,1):
   - 1 + 1 = 2 (not a perfect square)
   - 1² + 1² = 2 (not a perfect square)
   - 1³ + 1³ = 2 (not a perfect square)
   This clearly doesn't satisfy any of the conditions.

However, the ground truth answer itself appears to be incorrect since it doesn't satisfy the second condition. The proposed answer is definitely wrong, but the ground truth also seems wrong.

<<<False>>>
