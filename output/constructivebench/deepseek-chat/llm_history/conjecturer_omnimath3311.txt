theorem omnimath3311 :
  {a : Fin 5 → ℤ | (∀ i : Fin 5, a i ≤ i.1) ∧ (∀ i j : Fin 5, i ≤ j → a i ≤ a j)}.ncard = omnimath3311_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the constraints:
1. Each a i ≤ i (since i.1 is the value of the Fin element)
2. Sequence must be non-decreasing
This is equivalent to counting weakly increasing sequences where each term is bounded by its index. This is a classic combinatorial problem whose answer is the Catalan number C₅ = 42.
