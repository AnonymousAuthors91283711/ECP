theorem omnimath3381 : 
  List.foldr (fun (d : ℕ) (n : ℤ) => n * (-4) + d) 0 omnimath3381_answer = -2013 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: List ℕ
Looking at the pattern of converting -2013 through repeated operations of multiplying by -4 and adding digits, the answer appears to be the base (-4) representation of -2013. The enumerated answers confirm this pattern.
