Looking at the problem constraints and enumerated answers, we can see this is solving a system of equations with integer solutions. The key is to find s when s > 50. From the equations c*t + s = 100 and c + s*t = 101, we can eliminate t to find integer solutions for c and s. The only solution where s > 50 is s = 99 (with c = 1, t = 1.01).

<<<99>>>
