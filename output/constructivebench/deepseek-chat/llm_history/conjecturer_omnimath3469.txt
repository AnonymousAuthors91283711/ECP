  z = (omnimath3469_answer / 100) * y := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the given equations h1 and h2, we can derive z in terms of y:
x = 0.2*y and x = 0.5*z ⇒ 0.2*y = 0.5*z ⇒ z = (0.2/0.5)*y = 0.4*y
Since the theorem states z = (answer/100)*y, we need answer = 40 to match 0.4*y.
