Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 4 * Real.sqrt 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal possible value of |z₁z₂ + z₃z₄| where z₁,z₂,z₃,z₄ are roots of the given quartic polynomial.

2. First, we can find the roots of the polynomial f(X) = X⁴ + 14X³ + 52X² + 56X + 16. This can be factored as (X² + 6X + 4)(X² + 8X + 4).

3. Solving these quadratics gives us the roots: -3±√5 and -4±2√3.

4. Now we need to consider all permutations of pairing these roots to calculate |z₁z₂ + z₃z₄|.

5. The minimal value occurs when we pair (-3+√5 with -3-√5) and (-4+2√3 with -4-2√3):
   - Product of first pair: (-3+√5)(-3-√5) = 9 - 5 = 4
   - Product of second pair: (-4+2√3)(-4-2√3) = 16 - 12 = 4
   - Sum: 4 + 4 = 8

6. The proposed answer is 4√2 ≈ 5.656, which is less than the correct minimal value of 8.

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the minimal value we calculated.
