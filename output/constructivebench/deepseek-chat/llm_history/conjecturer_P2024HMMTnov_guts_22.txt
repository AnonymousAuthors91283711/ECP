: {k : ℕ | 1 ≤ k ∧ k ≤ 50 ∧ ∃ a b : ℕ, a > b ∧ a - b = k ∧ ¬∃ p : ℕ, p > 1 ∧ p^2 ∣ GCDMonoid.gcd (a^3 - b^3) ((a - b)^3)}.encard = P2024HMMTnov_guts_22_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern in the enumerated answers and considering the condition that a-b must be square-free (since if k had a square factor p², then p² would divide both terms), the answer should count square-free numbers between 1 and 50.
