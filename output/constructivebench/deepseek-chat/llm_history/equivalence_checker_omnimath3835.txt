Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0), (-2, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(0, 0), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (2, -2), (-2, 2)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all integer pairs (m, n) that satisfy m⁵ - n⁵ = 16mn.

2. Ground Truth Answer gives only {(0, 0), (-2, 2)}.

3. Proposed Answer gives more pairs: {(0, 0), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (2, -2), (-2, 2)}.

Let's test the proposed pairs:
- (0,0): 0-0 = 16*0*0 → 0=0 ✓
- (1,-1): 1-(-1) = 16*1*(-1) → 2=-16 ✗
- (-1,1): (-1)-1 = 16*(-1)*1 → -2=-16 ✗
- (2,-2): 32-(-32) = 16*2*(-2) → 64=-64 ✗
- (-2,2): (-32)-32 = 16*(-2)*2 → -64=-64 ✓

Only (0,0) and (-2,2) satisfy the equation. The other pairs in the proposed answer don't work. The proposed answer includes incorrect pairs.
