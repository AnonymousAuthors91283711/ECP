From the problem constraints and the pattern of Fibonacci-like additions, the maximal value occurs when we select the largest possible numbers from the given set while maintaining the sequence constraints. The enumerated answers suggest the maximum is achieved with the sequence [13, 11, 2, 9, -7, ...] but since we must stay in the given set, the valid maximum is:

<<<13>>>
