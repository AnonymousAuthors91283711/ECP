abbrev omnimath1759_answer : ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath1759 :
  (∑ n ∈ Set.Icc 1 199, (if (n % 10 = 0) then 0 else (if Odd (n : ℤ) then 1 else -1) * (n : ℤ))) = omnimath1759_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℤ
Looking at the pattern from n=1 to 199, the terms alternate between +1 (odd n) and -1 (even n), except when n is divisible by 10 (which gives 0). Since 199 is odd, there are more +1 terms than -1. The exact count gives +10 as the sum.
