Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2 * n - 1) / 5
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n / 2 * ((n + 1) / 2)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of pairs (a,b) where:
   - All pairs have distinct elements (a≠b, etc.)
   - a + b ≤ n
   - All pairs have distinct sums

2. Ground truth answer is (2n-1)/5, which suggests a linear relationship with n.

3. Proposed answer is n/2 * ((n+1)/2), which is quadratic in n (approximately n²/4).

The proposed answer grows much faster than the ground truth answer, suggesting it's incorrect. The quadratic nature of the proposed answer doesn't match the linear nature expected from the problem constraints.
