abbrev omnimath2476_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2476 :
  ∃ a b : ℕ, Nat.Coprime a b ∧ omnimath2476_answer = 100 * a + b ∧
    let n := 2020;
    let total := n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 6;
    let isosceles := n * (n - 1);
    isosceles / Nat.gcd isosceles total = a ∧
    total / Nat.gcd isosceles total = b := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern and simplifying the gcd calculation:
- total = 2020*2019*2018/6
- isosceles = 2020*2019
- gcd(isosceles, total) = 2020*2019/gcd(6,2018) = 2020*2019/2
- Simplified fractions give a=3, b=1009
