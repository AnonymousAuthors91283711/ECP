Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n - 2
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n < 2 then 0 else n
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but differs from the ground truth in the case where n < 2. The problem specifies n ≥ 2 in the theorem statement, so the n < 2 case shouldn't be considered. For n ≥ 2, both answers give n-2 (since the proposed answer gives n, but the ground truth is n-2). However, the problem's context suggests we should only consider n ≥ 2, where they differ by 2. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent in the domain that matters.
