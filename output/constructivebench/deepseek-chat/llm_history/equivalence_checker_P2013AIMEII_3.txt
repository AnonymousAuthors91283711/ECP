theorem P2013AIMEII_3 :
  let totalTime := ∑ k in Finset.range 119, 10 * (k + 1)
  let halfTime := totalTime / 2
  let heightAtHalfTime := 119 - (Finset.card {k ∈ Finset.range 119 | ∑ i in Finset.range k, 10 * (i + 1) ≤ halfTime})
  10 * heightAtHalfTime = P2013AIMEII_3_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 35
Proposed Answer: 1190 - 10 * Nat.sqrt (119 * 120 / 4)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem is about finding the height at which a ladder is positioned when exactly half the total time has passed in a specific scenario.

2. The ground truth answer is 35, which means the correct height would be at 35 * 10 = 350 cm (since the answer is multiplied by 10 in the theorem statement).

3. The proposed answer suggests a formula: 1190 - 10 * Nat.sqrt (119 * 120 / 4)

Let's evaluate the proposed answer:
- 119 * 120 / 4 = 3570
- Nat.sqrt(3570) ≈ 59.75 (but since it's Nat.sqrt, it would be 59)
- 10 * 59 = 590
- 1190 - 590 = 600

This gives a final answer of 600, which is very different from the correct answer of 350. The proposed formula doesn't match the problem's requirements or the ground truth answer.
