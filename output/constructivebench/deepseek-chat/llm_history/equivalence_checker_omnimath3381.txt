Ground Truth Answer: [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3]
Proposed Answer: [3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3]
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

The problem defines a recursive formula where each digit in the list is processed as:
n * (-4) + d, starting with n=0.

For the ground truth [2,0,0,2,0,3]:
0 * (-4) + 3 = 3
3 * (-4) + 0 = -12
-12 * (-4) + 2 = 50
50 * (-4) + 0 = -200
-200 * (-4) + 0 = 800
800 * (-4) + 2 = -3198 ≠ -2013

Wait, this doesn't match the claimed result. Let me check the order - the foldr processes from right to left, so the calculation is correct but doesn't match -2013.

For the proposed answer [3,1,1,2,1,3]:
0 * (-4) + 3 = 3
3 * (-4) + 1 = -11
-11 * (-4) + 2 = 46
46 * (-4) + 1 = -183
-183 * (-4) + 1 = 733
733 * (-4) + 3 = -2929 ≠ -2013

Neither answer actually produces -2013. The ground truth answer seems incorrect, and the proposed answer is also incorrect but different.

<<<False>>>
