Explanation: The problem asks for the largest number n such that we can partition subsets of {1,...,100} into triples where each triple satisfies a*b=c and all triples are disjoint. The maximum possible is clearly 100 since we can use all numbers in singleton triples (1*1=1, 2*1=2, etc.), but the enumerated answer suggests 100 is achievable.
