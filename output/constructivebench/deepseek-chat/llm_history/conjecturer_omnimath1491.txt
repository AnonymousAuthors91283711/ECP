Looking at the problem, we need to count paths of length 20 on a 2x2 grid starting at (0,0) that sum to exactly 20. The grid values are fixed (1,2,3,4). The key observation is that the minimal sum (all 1s) is 20 and maximal sum (all 4s) is 80. The only way to get sum exactly 20 is by taking exactly 20 steps of value 1 (staying at (0,0)). There's only 1 such path.
