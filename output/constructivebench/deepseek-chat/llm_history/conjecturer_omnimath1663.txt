abbrev omnimath1663_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath1663 :
  ∃ (p q : ℚ[X]), degree p ≤ 2 ∧ degree q ≤ 2 ∧
  (∀ n ∈ ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5} : Finset ℕ), eval (n : ℚ) p / eval (n : ℚ) q = (n : ℚ)^3) ∧
  eval 0 p / eval 0 q = omnimath1663_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
From the problem, we need rational polynomials p,q of degree ≤2 satisfying p(n)/q(n)=n³ for n=1..5, and we need the value at 0. The pattern suggests interpolation with rational functions. The enumerated answers hint at a simple fraction. The most plausible answer is:

<<<0>>> 

Explanation: The condition suggests p(x) = x³q(x) for x=1..5. With degree constraints, the only solution is p=0 and q arbitrary, giving p(0)/q(0)=0.
