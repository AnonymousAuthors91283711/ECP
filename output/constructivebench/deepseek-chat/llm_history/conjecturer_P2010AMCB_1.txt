Based on the problem statement and error message, I can see this is about calculating a real-valued answer involving time durations. The problem involves two meeting times (45 minutes and 90 minutes) and asks for their sum divided by 9.

The error occurs because Lean requires explicit marking of noncomputable real number operations. The proposed answer 1/4 is correct mathematically, but needs proper Lean syntax. Here's the fixed version:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2010AMCB_1_answer : ℝ := 1 / 4>>>

Explanation:
1. The mathematical calculation is correct: (45/60 + 90/60)/9 = (135/60)/9 = (2.25)/9 = 0.25 = 1/4
2. The error occurs because real number division in Lean is noncomputable by default
3. Adding 'noncomputable' fixes the compilation error while maintaining the correct mathematical value
4. The answer is generalized as a constant real number since the problem gives specific meeting times[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to provide a real number answer (ℝ) for P2010AMCB_1_answer. The error suggests we need to mark it as noncomputable since it involves real number division. The proposed answer 1/4 seems correct based on the given conditions (first_meeting = 45/60 = 3/4, second_meeting = 2*(3/4) = 3/2, sum is 9/4, divided by 9 gives 1/4).

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<(1 : ℝ)/4>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem involves real number division, so we need to specify the type explicitly
2. We use (1 : ℝ) to ensure we're working with real numbers from the start
3. The division operation will then be the real number division
4. The answer 1/4 matches the calculation: (3/4 + 3/2)/9 = (9/4)/9 = 1/4
5. The noncomputable issue is avoided by using the explicit real number notation[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem statement and error message, we need to provide a real number answer for P2010AMCB_1_answer. The error suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real number division.

The problem involves two meeting times:
1. first_meeting = 45/60 hours (which is 0.75 hours)
2. second_meeting = 2 * first_meeting = 1.5 hours

The expression we need to evaluate is (first_meeting + second_meeting)/9 = (0.75 + 1.5)/9 = 2.25/9 = 0.25 = 1/4

Here's the corrected answer in Lean:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2010AMCB_1_answer : ℝ := 1/4>>>

The noncomputable annotation is needed because real number division in Lean is noncomputable by default. The answer 1/4 matches the calculation from the problem statement and should satisfy the theorem.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to provide a real number answer (ℝ) for P2010AMCB_1_answer. The error suggests we need to make the definition noncomputable since it involves real number division.

The problem involves two meeting times:
1. first_meeting = 45/60 hours (which is 0.75 hours)
2. second_meeting = 2 * first_meeting = 1.5 hours

The expression we need to evaluate is (first_meeting + second_meeting)/9, which would be (0.75 + 1.5)/9 = 2.25/9 = 0.25 = 1/4.

Here's the corrected answer in Lean format:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2010AMCB_1_answer : ℝ := 1/4>>>

The noncomputable annotation is necessary because real number division in Lean is not computable by default. The answer 1/4 matches the calculation from the problem's conditions.

Explanation:
1. Converted 45 minutes to 0.75 hours (45/60)
2. Second meeting is twice that (1.5 hours)
3. Sum is 2.25 hours
4. Divided by 9 gives 0.25 hours (1/4 hour)
