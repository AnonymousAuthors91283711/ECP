Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the number of strictly positive integer sequences of length 10 where:
   - The sequence follows the Fibonacci recurrence relation (aₙ₊₂ = aₙ₊₁ + aₙ) for the first 8 terms
   - The 10th term (a₉) is fixed at 2002
   - All terms are positive

2. The ground truth answer is 3, meaning there are exactly 3 such sequences.

3. The proposed answer is 4, which would mean there's one more valid sequence than the ground truth claims.

To determine equivalence:
- The Fibonacci-like recurrence relation with fixed a₉ = 2002 and positive constraints should indeed have exactly 3 solutions (determined by possible initial pairs (a₀, a₁) that satisfy all conditions)
- The proposed answer of 4 is incorrect as it overcounts the valid sequences

<<<False>>>
