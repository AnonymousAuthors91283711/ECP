Ground Truth Answer: 78
Proposed Answer: 100
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a predicate P(a,b) that holds when:
   - a and b are between 1 and 100
   - a*b = (lcm(a,b)/gcd(a,b))^2

2. We're asked to find the maximum possible value of a+b where P(a,b) holds.

3. The condition a*b = (lcm(a,b)/gcd(a,b))^2 can be simplified using the relationship lcm(a,b)*gcd(a,b) = a*b, which gives us that a*b must be a perfect square.

4. The ground truth answer is 78, which would correspond to pairs like (50,28) or other combinations where a*b is a perfect square and a+b is maximized.

5. The proposed answer is 100, which would correspond to (100,0), but 0 is not allowed (b must be >0), or (100,100), but 100*100=10000 is a perfect square, but 100+100=200 > 78.

However, the maximum sum where a*b is a perfect square and both numbers are between 1 and 100 is indeed higher than 78 (for example, 98+2=100 since 98*2=196=14²). Therefore, the proposed answer is actually correct and the ground truth appears to be incorrect.
