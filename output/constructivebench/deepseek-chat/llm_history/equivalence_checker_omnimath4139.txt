  (∀ x y, 0 < x → 0 < y → (x + 1/x) * f y = f (x * y) + f (y / x)) ↔

Ground Truth Answer: fun a b x => a * x + b / x
Proposed Answer: fun a b x => a * (x - 1 / x) + b * (x + 1 / x)
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer is: f(x) = a*x + b/x
The proposed answer is: f(x) = a*(x - 1/x) + b*(x + 1/x)

Let's expand the proposed answer:
f(x) = a*x - a/x + b*x + b/x
     = (a + b)*x + (-a + b)/x

This can be rewritten as:
f(x) = A*x + B/x where A = a + b and B = -a + b

This shows that the proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer, but with different coefficients. The proposed answer is just a linear combination of the ground truth form. Both forms can represent the same general solution, just with different parameterizations.

Therefore, the answers are equivalent.
