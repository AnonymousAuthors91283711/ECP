Ground Truth Answer: -8
Proposed Answer: (-7 : ℚ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a quadratic equation: x² + (7+8)x + 7*8 = 0 → x² + 15x + 56 = 0
2. The roots of this equation are x = [-15 ± √(225-224)]/2 = [-15 ± 1]/2
3. So the roots are: (-15 + 1)/2 = -7 and (-15 - 1)/2 = -8
4. The problem asks for the least element in the roots set excluding {-8} (which is -n)
5. The remaining root is -7, which is indeed greater than -8

The ground truth answer claims -8 is the least element, but:
- -8 is excluded by the condition (roots \ {-n})
- The only remaining root is -7
- -7 is actually greater than -8

The proposed answer (-7) is correct because:
1. It's the only remaining root after excluding -8
2. It is indeed the least element in the set { -7 } (though trivially, since it's the only element)

<<<False>>>
The ground truth answer is incorrect while the proposed answer is correct. They are not equivalent.
