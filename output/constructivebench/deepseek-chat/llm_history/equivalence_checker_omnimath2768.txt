Ground Truth Answer: fun (x, y) => (3 * x + 2 * y) - (3 * x - 2 * y)
Proposed Answer: fun (x, y) => 4 * y
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a theorem about integer values x and y with specific constraints (x = -2, y = -1), but asks for a general solution.

2. The ground truth answer is the direct expression from the theorem: (3*x + 2*y) - (3*x - 2*y)

3. The proposed answer simplifies this to: 4*y

Let's verify if they're equivalent by simplifying the ground truth:
(3*x + 2*y) - (3*x - 2*y) = 3*x + 2*y - 3*x + 2*y = (3*x - 3*x) + (2*y + 2*y) = 0 + 4*y = 4*y

The simplification shows they are indeed mathematically equivalent for all integer values of x and y, not just the specific cases given in the theorem.
