<<<10! / 6>>> 

Explanation: The problem counts permutations of 10 elements with a specific 3-element decreasing pattern. For any 3 positions i<j<k, the probability of π(j)<π(k)<π(i) is 1/6 (since there are 6 possible orderings). There are C(10,3) = 120 such triples. Total permutations is 10!. Thus 10! × (120/6) = 10! × 20 = 10!/6.
