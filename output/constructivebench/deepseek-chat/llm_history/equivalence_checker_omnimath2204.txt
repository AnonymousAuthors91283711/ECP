Ground Truth Answer: 1/3
Proposed Answer: -2 * (1 - Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 3))
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the greatest coefficient 'a' of a quadratic polynomial p(n) = a*n² + b*n + c that matches the real parts of zⁿ at n=0,1,2,3, under certain conditions on z.

2. The ground truth answer is 1/3, which is approximately 0.333...

3. The proposed answer is -2*(1 - cos(2π/3)). Let's evaluate this:
   - cos(2π/3) = -1/2
   - So the expression becomes -2*(1 - (-1/2)) = -2*(3/2) = -3
   - This is clearly different from 1/3

The proposed answer evaluates to -3, which is not equal to the ground truth answer of 1/3. The answers are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
