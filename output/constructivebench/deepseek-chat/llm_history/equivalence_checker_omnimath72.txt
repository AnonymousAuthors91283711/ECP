Ground Truth Answer: fun n t => (n + t - 1) / t
Proposed Answer: fun n t => n - t + 1
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of teams (k) where we can select one distinct color from each team, given n colors and teams of size ≤ t.

2. The ground truth answer (n + t - 1)/t represents the maximum number of disjoint teams possible, which is the correct solution to this problem. This is a known result in combinatorics.

3. The proposed answer n - t + 1 is incorrect because:
   - It doesn't account for the team size constraint properly
   - It can give negative results when t > n+1
   - It doesn't match the combinatorial interpretation of the problem
   - For example, when n=5 and t=2:
     - Ground truth gives (5+2-1)/2 = 3
     - Proposed answer gives 5-2+1 = 4 (which is wrong)
