Ground Truth Answer: 0
Proposed Answer: 2011 * 2012 * 2013
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a complex expression involving multiplications of large numbers and asks us to simplify it.

2. The ground truth answer is 0, which suggests that the two terms in the expression are equal when simplified.

3. The proposed answer is 2011 * 2012 * 2013, which is clearly not equal to 0.

4. To verify, let's look at the structure of the original expression:
   - First term: 2011 * 20122012 * 201320132013
   - Second term: 2013 * 20112011 * 201220122012

5. Notice that:
   - 20122012 = 2012 * 10001
   - 201320132013 = 2013 * 100010001
   - 20112011 = 2011 * 10001
   - 201220122012 = 2012 * 100010001

6. When we substitute these into the original expression, we can see that both terms simplify to the same value (2011 * 2012 * 2013 * 10001 * 100010001), making their difference 0.

The proposed answer gives the product of the three base numbers (2011, 2012, 2013) but fails to recognize that the entire expression simplifies to 0. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
