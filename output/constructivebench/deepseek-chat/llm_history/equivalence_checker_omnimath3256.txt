Ground Truth Answer: { ( (3^(1/5) + 1)/2, (3^(1/5) - 1)/2 ), 
    ( -(3^(1/5) + 1)/2, -(3^(1/5) - 1)/2 ) }
Proposed Answer: {(1/2, 1/2), (-1/2, -1/2)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a system of two equations with variables x and y.
2. The ground truth answer provides solutions involving 3^(1/5) (fifth root of 3).
3. The proposed answer provides simple fractional solutions.

Testing the proposed answer (1/2, 1/2):
- First equation: 1/(1/2) + 1/(2*1/2) = 2 + 1 = 3
  Right side: ((1/2)^2 + 3*(1/2)^2)*(3*(1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2) = (1/4 + 3/4)*(3/4 + 1/4) = 1*1 = 1 ≠ 3
This doesn't satisfy the first equation.

The proposed answer clearly doesn't satisfy the given equations, while the ground truth answer (which involves fifth roots) is more likely to be correct given the complexity of the equations.
