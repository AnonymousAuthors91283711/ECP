Looking at the problem, it's about counting 4×4 binary matrices with specific row and column sum conditions that correspond to permutations. The enumerated answers suggest this is related to counting permutation matrices with additional constraints. The most natural answer is the number of 4×4 permutation matrices, which is 4! = 24.
