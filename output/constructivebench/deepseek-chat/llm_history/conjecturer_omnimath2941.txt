theorem omnimath2941 :
  Set.ncard {t : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ | let (a, b, c) := t; a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ c > 0 ∧ 6 * a * b = c ^ 2 ∧ a < b ∧ b < c ∧ c ≤ 35} = omnimath2941_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the problem constraints:
1. 6ab = c²
2. 0 < a < b < c ≤ 35
3. c must be divisible by 6 (since 6ab is perfect square)
Enumerating c from 6 to 35 by 6 gives possible c values: 6,12,18,24,30,36 (but 36>35)
For each c, find (a,b) pairs satisfying all conditions. Counting valid pairs gives the answer.
