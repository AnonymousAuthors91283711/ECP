Ground Truth Answer: 7521
Proposed Answer: 3211
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest 4-digit number (n = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d) where:
   - Digits are strictly decreasing (a > b > c > d > 0)
   - The complex expression involving roots of unity evaluates to √3

2. The ground truth answer is 7521, which means:
   - a=7, b=5, c=2, d=1
   - This satisfies all conditions including the complex expression

3. The proposed answer is 3211:
   - This violates the digit condition since c=1 and d=1 (must be c > d)
   - Even if we consider 3210, it would violate d > 0
   - The digits don't satisfy the strictly decreasing condition

The proposed answer fails to meet the basic digit constraints of the problem, regardless of whether it satisfies the complex expression condition. Therefore, it's incorrect.
