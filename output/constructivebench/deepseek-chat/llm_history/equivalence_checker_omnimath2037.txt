Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (1 / 6)^n
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (2^n - 3^n) / 5^n
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is about finding the value of a linear functional f evaluated at the constant function 5, given certain conditions. The key points are:

1. The functional f is linear in each argument (h_linear)
2. For functions taking only values 3 or 4, f evaluates to the product of reciprocals (h_special)
3. We need to find f evaluated at the constant function 5

The ground truth answer (1/6)^n makes sense because:
- For n=1, we can find f(5) by linear interpolation between f(3) and f(4)
- The interpolation gives f(5) = (1/3) + (5-3)*(1/4 - 1/3) = 1/6
- For general n, by multilinearity this becomes (1/6)^n

The proposed answer (2^n - 3^n)/5^n:
- Doesn't match the ground truth
- For n=1 it gives -1/5 instead of 1/6
- The form doesn't align with the expected behavior of the problem
