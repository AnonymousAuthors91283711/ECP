Ground Truth Answer: 6156
Proposed Answer: 9801
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n > 0 where there exists an integer k such that:
   k = √(100 + √n) + √(100 - √n)

2. The ground truth answer is 6156, which comes from solving:
   - Let x = √n, then the equation becomes k = √(100 + x) + √(100 - x)
   - Squaring both sides gives k² = 200 + 2√(10000 - x²)
   - For k to be integer, √(10000 - x²) must be rational, meaning 10000 - x² must be a perfect square
   - The smallest n = x² satisfying this condition is 6156

3. The proposed answer is 9801, which is 99². This would make x = 99, but:
   - √(100 - 99) = √1 = 1
   - √(100 + 99) = √199 ≈ 14.107, which is irrational
   - Thus k would be irrational, not integer as required

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the problem's conditions, while the ground truth does.
