Ground Truth Answer: {m : ℤ | ∃ k : ℤ, k^2 = m ∨ 2*k^2 = m}
Proposed Answer: {m | ∃ k : ℤ, m = k^2 - 2 ∨ m = -k^2 - 2}
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground Truth: {m | ∃ k : ℤ, k² = m ∨ 2k² = m}
Proposed: {m | ∃ k : ℤ, m = k² - 2 ∨ m = -k² - 2}

These are clearly different sets:
1. The ground truth includes all perfect squares and twice perfect squares (non-negative numbers)
2. The proposed answer includes numbers shifted by -2, both positive and negative

For example:
- m = 1: 
  - In ground truth (k=1 gives 1²=1)
  - Not in proposed (would require k²=3 or k²=-3, neither possible with integer k)
- m = -1:
  - Not in ground truth
  - In proposed (k=1 gives -1=1-2)

The sets are fundamentally different in both form and content. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth.
