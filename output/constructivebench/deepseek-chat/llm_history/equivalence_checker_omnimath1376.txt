Ground Truth Answer: fun x => (log (x / (x - 1))) / 2
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℚ => (1/2) * log (x^2 / |1 - x|)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the two answers:

1. Ground truth: (log (x / (x - 1))) / 2
2. Proposed: (1/2) * log (x^2 / |1 - x|)

Let's simplify the proposed answer:
(1/2) * log (x^2 / |1 - x|) = (1/2) * [log(x^2) - log|1 - x|] = (1/2) * [2log|x| - log|1 - x|] = log|x| - (1/2)log|1 - x|

Now simplify the ground truth:
(1/2) * log(x / (x - 1)) = (1/2) * [log|x| - log|x - 1|] = (1/2)log|x| - (1/2)log|x - 1|

These are not equivalent expressions. The proposed answer has an extra log|x| term and handles the absolute value differently.

However, let's check if they satisfy the original functional equation f(x) + f(1 - 1/x) = log|x|:

For the ground truth:
f(x) + f(1 - 1/x) = [1/2 log(x/(x-1))] + [1/2 log((1-1/x)/(1-1/x - 1))] 
= 1/2 [log(x/(x-1)) + log((x-1)/x^2)] 
= 1/2 log(1/x) 
= -1/2 log|x| 
This doesn't match the required log|x|.

Wait, this suggests neither answer satisfies the original equation. There might be an error in the ground truth or the problem statement. Given this uncertainty:
