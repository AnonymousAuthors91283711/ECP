Looking at the problem and the proposed answer, I notice several issues:

1. The proposed answer is unnecessarily complex - it's adding two expressions that could be simplified
2. The error suggests we need to mark it as noncomputable since it involves real division
3. The structure of the answer doesn't match the expected simple form from the problem constraints

From the given equations:
- We know x + y = 5 and x² - y² = 40 (since 1/T = 40)
- x² - y² = (x+y)(x-y) = 5(x-y) = 40 ⇒ x-y = 8
- With x+y=5 and x-y=8, we can solve for x = (5+8)/2 = 6.5
- Then from x-z = -7 ⇒ z = x+7 = 13.5
- Therefore x + z = 6.5 + 13.5 = 20

The simplified answer should just be 20. Here's the corrected version:

<<<20>>> 

Explanation:
The key insight was recognizing that x²-y² factors into (x+y)(x-y), allowing us to find x-y directly. Then solving the system of equations for x and z gives the simple final answer of 20. The original proposed answer was attempting to reconstruct this through a more complicated path, but the direct solution is much cleaner.
