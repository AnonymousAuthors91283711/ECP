From the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we're looking for a two-digit number 'a' (10 ≤ a < 100) where its reverse (digits swapped) multiplied by some 'b' equals 161, and we need to find the product a*b. The only two-digit number whose reverse multiplied by an integer gives 161 is 23 (since 32 * 5 = 160 is close but 23 * 7 = 161). Thus the answer is 23 * 7 = 161.

<<<161>>>
