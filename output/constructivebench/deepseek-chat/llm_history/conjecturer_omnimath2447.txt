abbrev omnimath2447_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath2447 :
  ∃! (P : ℚ[X]), degree P ≤ 3 ∧
  (∀ x ∈ ({1, 2, 3, 4} : Finset ℕ), eval (↑x) P = 1 / (1 + x + x^2)) ∧
  eval 5 P = omnimath2447_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
From the problem, we need a unique cubic polynomial P that interpolates 1/(1+x+x²) at x=1,2,3,4 and has a specific value at x=5. The enumerated answer suggests evaluating the interpolating polynomial at 5. The pattern from Lagrange interpolation gives:

<<<1/651>>>
