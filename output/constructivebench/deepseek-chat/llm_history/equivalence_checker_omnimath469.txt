Ground Truth Answer: 11621
Proposed Answer: 9801
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the minimal x + y where x,y are natural numbers ≥1 satisfying the Pell-like equation x² - 29y² = 1.

2. The ground truth answer is 11621, which comes from the minimal solution (x=9801, y=1820), since 9801 + 1820 = 11621.

3. The proposed answer is 9801, which is just the x-value of the minimal solution, not the sum x+y.

The proposed answer gives only part of the required solution (just x) rather than the requested sum x+y. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
