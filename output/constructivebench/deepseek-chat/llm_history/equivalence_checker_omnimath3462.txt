abbrev omnimath3462_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3462 : 
  omnimath3462_answer % 3 ≠ 0 ∧ 
  ¬IsSquare omnimath3462_answer ∧ 
  Nat.Prime (digits 10 omnimath3462_answer).sum := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 14
Proposed Answer: 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a natural number that satisfies three conditions:
   a) Not divisible by 3 (n % 3 ≠ 0)
   b) Not a perfect square (¬IsSquare n)
   c) The sum of its digits is a prime number

2. Ground Truth Answer (14):
   - 14 % 3 = 2 ≠ 0 ✔
   - 14 is not a perfect square (3²=9, 4²=16) ✔
   - Sum of digits: 1 + 4 = 5 (prime) ✔

3. Proposed Answer (5):
   - 5 % 3 = 2 ≠ 0 ✔
   - 5 is not a perfect square ✔
   - Sum of digits: 5 (prime) ✔

Both answers satisfy all three conditions. While they are different numbers, both are correct solutions to the problem. The problem doesn't specify that the answer needs to be unique, so both are valid.
