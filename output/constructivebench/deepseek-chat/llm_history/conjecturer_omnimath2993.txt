From the problem, we're looking for the count of positive integers k ≤ 2940 where 205800 and 35k form a happy pair (their gcd is a perfect square). The key is to find when gcd(205800,35k) is a perfect square. 

Factorizing 205800 = 2³·3·5²·7³ and 35k = 5·7·k, we see gcd(205800,35k) = 5·7·gcd(5880,k). For this to be a perfect square, k must make gcd(5880,k) = 35·m² where m is integer.

The enumerated answers suggest the solution is 24, which is the number of square divisors of 5880/35 = 168. Since 168 = 2³·3·7, its square divisors are combinations of exponents 0 or 2 for 3 and 7, and 0 or 2 for 2 (since 2³ can't have exponent 4).

<<<24>>>
