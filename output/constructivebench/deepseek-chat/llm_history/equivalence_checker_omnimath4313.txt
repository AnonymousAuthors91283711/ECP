Ground Truth Answer: fun n => Even n ∧ n > 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => Even n ∨ n = 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding conditions under which we can construct a certain injective function on a grid with adjacency and modulo constraints.

2. The ground truth answer states that n must be even AND greater than 1 (Even n ∧ n > 1).

3. The proposed answer states that n must be even OR equal to 1 (Even n ∨ n = 1).

Key differences:
- The ground truth requires both conditions to be true simultaneously (even AND >1)
- The proposed answer allows either condition to be true (even OR =1)

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It would accept n=1, which shouldn't be valid (n must be >1)
- It would accept odd numbers >1 if they equal 1, which is impossible
- It misses the requirement that both conditions must hold
