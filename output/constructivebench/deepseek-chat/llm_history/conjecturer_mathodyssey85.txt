The error occurs because `Real.sqrt` is a noncomputable operation in Lean, so we need to mark the definition as `noncomputable`. The problem involves finding minimal a² + b² under certain distance constraints, and the proposed answer `5 - 2 * √5` appears correct based on geometric considerations (minimizing distance from a point to a circle).

Here's the fixed answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev mathodyssey85_answer : ℝ := 5 - 2 * Real.sqrt 5>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem involves finding minimal a² + b² where the maximum distance from (a,b) to points on a circle (centered at (0,4) with radius 1) is 6.
2. Geometrically, this corresponds to finding the point closest to the origin whose farthest point on the circle is at distance 6.
3. The solution involves minimizing the distance from origin while maintaining the maximum distance constraint, leading to the expression 5 - 2√5.
4. The `noncomputable` marker is needed because real number square roots cannot be computed exactly in Lean's logic.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error occurs because `Real.sqrt` is a noncomputable operation in Lean, and any definition using it must be marked as `noncomputable`. The proposed answer `5 - 2 * Real.sqrt 5` seems mathematically reasonable based on the problem's geometric interpretation (involving distances and optimization), but needs the `noncomputable` modifier.

Here's the fixed version:

<<<noncomputable abbrev mathodyssey85_answer : ℝ := 5 - 2 * Real.sqrt 5>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem involves finding minimal a² + b² under certain distance constraints
2. The expression 5 - 2√5 appears to be the minimal value satisfying the conditions
3. The geometric interpretation suggests this involves the distance between points and circles
4. The noncomputable modifier is needed because Real.sqrt isn't computable in Lean's logic
5. The answer maintains the same mathematical form but is now properly declared for Lean's type system[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
