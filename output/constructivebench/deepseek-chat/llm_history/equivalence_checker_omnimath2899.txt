abbrev omnimath2899_answer : â„• := sorry
theorem omnimath2899
: 8 * 10 ^ 5 + 4 * 10 ^ 3 + 9 * 10 + 5 = omnimath2899_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 804095
Proposed Answer: 804905
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents an equation to evaluate:
   8 * 10^5 + 4 * 10^3 + 9 * 10 + 5

2. Calculating step by step:
   - 8 * 10^5 = 800000
   - 4 * 10^3 = 4000
   - 9 * 10 = 90
   - 5 = 5
   Sum: 800000 + 4000 = 804000
         804000 + 90 = 804090
         804090 + 5 = 804095

3. Ground Truth Answer: 804095 (matches our calculation)
4. Proposed Answer: 804905 (does not match)

The proposed answer incorrectly adds 900 instead of 90 in the calculation.

<<<False>>>
