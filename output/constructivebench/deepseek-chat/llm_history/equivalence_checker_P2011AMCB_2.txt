Ground Truth Answer: 90
Proposed Answer: 85
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number x such that when added to the given scores (90,80,70,60,85), the new average of 6 scores is at least 3 points higher than the original average of 5 scores.

2. First, calculate the original average of 5 scores:
   (90 + 80 + 70 + 60 + 85)/5 = 385/5 = 77

3. The new average requirement is: new average ≥ 77 + 3 = 80

4. The inequality becomes:
   (385 + x)/6 ≥ 80
   385 + x ≥ 480
   x ≥ 95

5. Therefore, the smallest natural number satisfying this is 95.

Wait, this contradicts both the ground truth (90) and proposed answer (85). However, let's recheck the calculation:

Original sum: 90+80+70+60+85 = 385
Original average: 385/5 = 77
New average requirement: 77 + 3 = 80
Inequality: (385 + x)/6 ≥ 80 → 385 + x ≥ 480 → x ≥ 95

The calculation seems correct, meaning both given answers are incorrect. The correct answer should be 95.

Since both the ground truth (90) and proposed answer (85) are incorrect, but the proposed answer is closer to being correct (85 vs 90), I'll return:
