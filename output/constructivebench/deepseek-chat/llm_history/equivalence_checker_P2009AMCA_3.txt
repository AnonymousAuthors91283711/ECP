noncomputable abbrev P2009AMCA_3_answer : ‚Ñù := sorry
theorem P2009AMCA_3 :
  (1 / 4 + (1 / 3) * ((3 / 4) - 1 / 4) = P2009AMCA_3_answer) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 5 / 12
Proposed Answer: 1 / 3
Let's evaluate the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents an equation:
   (1/4 + (1/3)*((3/4) - 1/4)) = ?

2. Let's compute step by step:
   - Inner parentheses: (3/4 - 1/4) = 2/4 = 1/2
   - Multiplication: (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6
   - Final addition: 1/4 + 1/6 = 3/12 + 2/12 = 5/12

3. Ground truth answer is 5/12 (correct)
4. Proposed answer is 1/3 (incorrect)

The proposed answer of 1/3 doesn't match the correct computation of 5/12.
