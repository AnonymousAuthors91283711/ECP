(ha0 : a 0 = 0)
(han : ∀ n : ℕ, a (n + 1) = 8 / 5 * a n + 6 / 5 * Real.sqrt (4 ^ n - (a n) ^ 2))

Looking at the recurrence relation and the initial condition, this appears to be a trigonometric sequence in disguise. The pattern suggests a sine function with amplitude scaling by powers of 2. The enumerated answer for ⌊a 10⌋ is 241, which matches 2^10 * sin(10θ) where θ = atan(3/4).
