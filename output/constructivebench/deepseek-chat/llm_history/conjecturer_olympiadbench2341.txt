Looking at the problem, we're dealing with a mixture problem where we need to calculate the percentage of acid in the remaining solution after removing some mixture. The error occurs because Lean needs explicit marking of noncomputable operations on real numbers.

The proposed answer correctly calculates:
- Total initial acid: 4 + 10 + 15 = 29
- Acid removed: 15 (from 25% of 60)
- Remaining acid: 29 - 15 = 14
- Total initial volume: 40 + 50 + 50 = 140
- Volume removed: 60
- Remaining volume: 140 - 60 = 80
- Percentage: (14/80)*100 = 17.5

Here's the corrected answer with noncomputable marking:

<<<noncomputable abbrev olympiadbench2341_answer : ℝ := 17.5>>> 

The explanation is:
1. We mark it noncomputable since it uses real number division
2. The value 17.5 comes from ((4+10+15-15)/(40+50+50-60))*100 = 14/80*100 = 17.5
3. This matches the enumerated answer pattern and solves the mixture problem correctly
