Based on the problem statement and error message, I need to create a proposition (Prop) that correctly states the condition for the existence of such a sequence. The error occurs because we need to make `a₀` a parameter of the proposition.

Looking at the recurrence relation `aₙ = 5*a_{n-1} + 4`, we can see it's a linear non-homogeneous recurrence. The solution will have a particular solution (constant) and homogeneous solution (geometric). The divisibility condition `2013 ∣ a 54` (where 2013 = 3×11×61) suggests we need congruence conditions modulo these primes.

The initial condition `a₀ ≡ 1 mod 3` appears in the enumerated answers because:
1. The recurrence modulo 3 simplifies to `aₙ ≡ 2*a_{n-1} + 1 mod 3`
2. The fixed point is 2, so the general solution is `aₙ ≡ 2 + c*2^n mod 3`
3. For `n=54`, we need `aₙ ≡ 0 mod 3`, which requires `a₀ ≡ 1 mod 3`

Here's the corrected answer:

The error occurs because `omnimath4424_answer` is declared as type `Prop` but the proposed answer is a function `ℕ → Prop`. Based on the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we need a proposition that characterizes when the condition holds for all `a₀ > 0`.

Looking at the recurrence relation `aₙ = 5aₙ₋₁ + 4`, we can analyze it modulo 3:
- If `a₀ ≡ 1 mod 3`, then `a₁ ≡ 5*1 + 4 ≡ 0 mod 3`, `a₂ ≡ 5*0 + 4 ≡ 1 mod 3`, and the pattern repeats every 2 steps
- Since 54 is even, `a₅₄ ≡ a₀ ≡ 1 mod 3` when `a₀ ≡ 1 mod 3`
- For 2013 to divide `a₅₄` (since 2013 = 3*11*61), we particularly need `3 ∣ a₅₄`, which requires `a₀ ≡ 1 mod 3`

Thus, the correct answer should be the proposition that `a₀ ≡ 1 mod 3`:

The error occurs because the proposed answer is trying to use `a₀` directly in the definition, but `a₀` is a parameter that should be part of the theorem statement, not the answer definition. The answer should be a proposition about `a₀` without directly referencing it in the definition.

Looking at the recurrence relation `aₙ = 5aₙ₋₁ + 4` and the divisibility condition `2013 ∣ a₅₄`, we can analyze the behavior modulo 3. Since 2013 = 3 × 11 × 61, we particularly care about divisibility by 3. The recurrence modulo 3 cycles every 2 steps, and we need `a₅₄ ≡ 0 mod 3`. Working backwards, this requires `a₀ ≡ 1 mod 3`.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<∀ a₀, 0 < a₀ → (a₀ % 3 = 1)>>> 

This states that for the theorem to hold, the initial value `a₀` must be congruent to 1 modulo 3. The pattern in the recurrence relation's behavior modulo 3 supports this conclusion, as it's the only initial condition that leads to `a₅₄` being divisible by 3.
