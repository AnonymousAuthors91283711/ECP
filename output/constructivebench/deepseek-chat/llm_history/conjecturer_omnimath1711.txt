Based on the problem statement, we have a system of three equations:
1. x = y + z + 2
2. y = z + x + 1
3. z = x + y + 4

We need to find the value of x + y + z. Let's analyze the system:

1. From equation 1: x - y - z = 2
2. From equation 2: -x + y - z = 1
3. From equation 3: -x - y + z = 4

Adding all three equations gives:
(x - y - z) + (-x + y - z) + (-x - y + z) = 2 + 1 + 4
=> -x - y - z = 7
=> x + y + z = -7

However, the proposed answer was (-5)/2, which doesn't match our calculation. The error in Lean is about noncomputability, which we can fix by marking the definition as noncomputable.

The correct answer should be -7 based on the system of equations. Here's the fixed version:
