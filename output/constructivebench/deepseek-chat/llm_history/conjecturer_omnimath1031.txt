Looking at the problem, we need to find the sum of phi_factorial(n) for n from 2 to 50 where gcd(n,50)=1, modulo 50. The phi_factorial is the product of numbers ≤n coprime to n. For numbers coprime to 50 (i.e., odd numbers not divisible by 5), their phi_factorial will include 1 and -1 mod 50 terms, which cancel out. The remaining product is likely 1 mod 50. There are φ(50)=20 such numbers, so the sum should be 20 mod 50.
