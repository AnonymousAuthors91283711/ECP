theorem omnimath2779
(x y : ℝ)
(hx : x > 0 ∧ ⌊x⌋ * x = 36)
(hy : y > 0 ∧ ⌊y⌋ * y = 71)
: x + y = omnimath2779_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Looking at the problem constraints and enumerated answers, we can deduce:
1. For x: ⌊x⌋ must be a factor of 36 (since x = 36/⌊x⌋)
2. Testing ⌊x⌋=6 gives x=6 (6*6=36)
3. For y: ⌊y⌋ must be a factor of 71 (prime)
4. Testing ⌊y⌋=1 gives y=71 (1*71=71)
5. Thus x+y=6+71=77
