Ground Truth Answer: (16, 3, 1, 1)
Proposed Answer: (1, 2, 3, 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a system of 7 equations with 4 variables (w, d, a, b). All variables must be positive integers.

2. The ground truth answer (16, 3, 1, 1) satisfies all equations:
   - For example, the first equation: 16*6 + 3*4 + 1*30 + 1*63 = 96 + 12 + 30 + 63 = 201 ✓
   - Similarly checks out for all other equations.

3. The proposed answer (1, 2, 3, 2):
   - Checking first equation: 1*6 + 2*4 + 3*30 + 2*63 = 6 + 8 + 90 + 126 = 230 ≠ 201
   - Already fails the first equation.

Since the proposed answer doesn't satisfy even the first equation, it's clearly incorrect.
