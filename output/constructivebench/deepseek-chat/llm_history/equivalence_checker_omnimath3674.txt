Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 3), (6, 15)}
Proposed Answer: Set.union (Set.image (fun k => (2 * k, k)) {k | k > 0}) (Set.image (fun k => (k, 2 * k)) {k | k > 0})
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The ground truth answer gives two specific pairs: (2,3) and (6,15)
2. The proposed answer suggests all pairs of the form (2k,k) or (k,2k) where k>0

Testing the ground truth pairs:
- (2,3): Doesn't fit either (2k,k) or (k,2k) pattern
- (6,15): Doesn't fit either pattern

Testing some pairs from the proposed answer:
- (2,1): Doesn't satisfy the original equation (2+1+1²=4 ≠ 2=lcm(2,1))
- (4,2): Doesn't satisfy (4+2+2²=10 ≠ 4=lcm(4,2))

The proposed answer is completely different from and incompatible with the ground truth answer. It includes many pairs that don't satisfy the original condition and misses the correct pairs.
