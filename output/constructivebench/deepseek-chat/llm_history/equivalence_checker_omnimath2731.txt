theorem omnimath2731 (x : ℝ) :
    (5 + x) / 2 = 7 ∧ (x + 9) / 2 = 12 ∧ (5 + 9) / 2 = 10 ↔ x = omnimath2731_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 15
Proposed Answer: 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us three equations combined with logical AND (∧) and asks for the value of x that satisfies all three simultaneously.

2. Let's solve each equation:
   - (5 + x)/2 = 7 → 5 + x = 14 → x = 9
   - (x + 9)/2 = 12 → x + 9 = 24 → x = 15
   - (5 + 9)/2 = 10 → 14/2 = 7 ≠ 10 (this is false regardless of x)

3. The ground truth answer is 15, which solves the second equation but not the first or third.
4. The proposed answer is 9, which solves the first equation but not the second or third.

However, the problem is using a biconditional (↔) where all three equations must be true simultaneously. Since the third equation is always false (7 ≠ 10), there is no solution that satisfies all three equations. Therefore, both answers are incorrect in the context of satisfying all three equations simultaneously.

But if we ignore the third equation (which is always false), the first two equations give conflicting requirements for x (9 vs 15), meaning there's no solution that satisfies both.
