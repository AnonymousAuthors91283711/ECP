theorem omnimath2905 :
  (2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 6 = 5 * 6 * omnimath2905_answer * omnimath2905_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the equation:
2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 6 = 5 * 6 * x * x

Simplify both sides:
(2² * 3² * 5 * 6) = (5 * 6 * x²)

Factor out 5*6 from both sides:
2² * 3² = x²

Thus x = 2*3 = 6

<<<6>>>
