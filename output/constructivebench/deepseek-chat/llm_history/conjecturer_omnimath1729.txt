Looking at the pattern of the sequence and the modulo requirement, the periodicity appears to be related to powers of 2. The minimal period that satisfies the condition is likely the smallest p where 2^p ≡ 1 mod 2014. Since 2014 = 2 × 19 × 53, we use Carmichael's theorem to find λ(2014) = lcm(1,18,52) = 468.
