theorem omnimath4407 (a : ℝ) (ha : 1 < a) :
  (∃ C, ∀ n, |omnimath4407_answer a n| ≤ C) ∧

Ground Truth Answer: fun a n => if n = 0 then 0 else (n : ℝ)^(-a) * (if Even n then 1 else -1)
Proposed Answer: fun a n => n^(1/a) * (if n % 2 = 0 then 1 else -1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function that:
   - Is bounded (first condition)
   - Has differences between distinct points that satisfy a certain inequality (second condition)

2. Ground Truth Answer:
   - For n=0: returns 0
   - For n≠0: returns ±n^(-a) (alternating signs based on parity)
   - This satisfies both conditions:
     * Bounded since n^(-a) → 0 as n→∞ (a > 1)
     * The difference condition holds due to the alternating signs and decay rate

3. Proposed Answer:
   - Returns ±n^(1/a) (alternating signs based on parity)
   - Problems:
     * Unbounded as n→∞ since 1/a > 0
     * Doesn't satisfy the first condition (no uniform bound C exists)
     * The growth rate is completely wrong (growing instead of decaying)

The proposed answer fails fundamentally by providing a function with opposite behavior to what's required.
