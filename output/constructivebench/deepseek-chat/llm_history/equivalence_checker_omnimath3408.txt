Ground Truth Answer: 7 * 2023
Proposed Answer: 2023 * 7^2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest positive natural number n that is:
   - A perfect square (n = k² for some k)
   - Divisible by 2023 (2023 ∣ n)

2. Ground Truth Answer: 7 * 2023 = 14161
   - But 14161 is not a perfect square (119² = 14161? 119² = 14161 is correct, but 7*2023 = 14161 is indeed 119²)
   - Wait, let's check: 2023 = 7 × 17 × 17
   - So 7 × 2023 = 7 × 7 × 17 × 17 = (7 × 17)² = 119²
   - So this is indeed a perfect square and divisible by 2023

3. Proposed Answer: 2023 * 7² = 2023 * 49 = 99127
   - Check if perfect square: √99127 ≈ 314.84 (not integer)
   - 2023 * 7² = 7 × 17² × 7² = 7³ × 17² which is not a perfect square

The ground truth answer is correct (7*2023 = 119² and divisible by 2023), while the proposed answer doesn't yield a perfect square.
