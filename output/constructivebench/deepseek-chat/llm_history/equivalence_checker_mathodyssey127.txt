Ground Truth Answer: 40 / 243
Proposed Answer: 10 * (1 / 3) ^ 3 * (2 / 3) ^ 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding P3 given that P1 = P2 and P1 ≠ 0, with all probabilities following binomial distribution formulas.

2. First, we need to find p such that P1 = P2:
   (5 choose 1)p(1-p)^4 = (5 choose 2)p^2(1-p)^3
   Simplifying gives: 5(1-p) = 10p ⇒ p = 1/3

3. Now plug p = 1/3 into P3:
   P3 = (5 choose 3)(1/3)^3(2/3)^2 = 10*(1/27)*(4/9) = 40/243

4. The proposed answer is: 10*(1/3)^3*(2/3)^2
   This is exactly the expression we get when substituting p=1/3 into the P3 formula before simplifying.

5. The ground truth answer is the simplified form: 40/243

The proposed answer is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth answer, just in an unsimplified form. Both represent the same value.
