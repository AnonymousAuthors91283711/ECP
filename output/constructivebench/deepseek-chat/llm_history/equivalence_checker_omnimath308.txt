Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n + 1) / 2
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 2 * n + 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

The problem is asking for the maximum size of a subset S of integers in [-n, n] where no three elements sum to zero. 

The ground truth answer is (n + 1)/2, which makes sense because:
1. For odd n, this gives (n+1)/2
2. For even n, this gives n/2 + 0.5, but since we need integer values, it would be n/2

This matches known results about sum-free sets where we can take all positive numbers (or all negative numbers) up to n, giving us about n/2 elements.

The proposed answer is 2n + 1, which would be the size of the entire interval [-n, n] (since that contains 2n + 1 elements). But clearly the entire interval fails the condition (we can pick 0,0,0 or -1,0,1 etc. that sum to zero).

Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect.
