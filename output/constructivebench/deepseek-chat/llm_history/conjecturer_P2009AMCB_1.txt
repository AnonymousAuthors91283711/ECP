  {b : ℕ | b ≤ 5 ∧ ∃ m : ℕ, 50 * (5 - b) + 75 * b = 100 * m} = {P2009AMCB_1_answer} := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the equation 50*(5-b) + 75*b = 100*m, we can simplify it to 250 - 50b + 75b = 100m → 250 + 25b = 100m → 25(10 + b) = 100m → (10 + b) = 4m. Since b ≤ 5, the only solution is b=2 (making 12=4*3). The enumerated answer confirms this.
