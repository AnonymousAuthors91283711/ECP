Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: 17
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

The problem asks to find natural numbers x and y such that:
1. x > 0 and y > 0
2. 2^11 * 6^5 = 4^x * 3^y
3. x + y equals some answer (which we're comparing)

First, let's simplify the equation:
2^11 * 6^5 = 4^x * 3^y
6^5 = (2*3)^5 = 2^5 * 3^5
So left side becomes: 2^11 * 2^5 * 3^5 = 2^16 * 3^5
Right side: 4^x = (2^2)^x = 2^(2x)
So equation becomes: 2^16 * 3^5 = 2^(2x) * 3^y

This gives us two equations:
1. For powers of 2: 16 = 2x ⇒ x = 8
2. For powers of 3: 5 = y

Now x + y = 8 + 5 = 13

The ground truth answer is 13, which matches our calculation.
The proposed answer is 17, which is incorrect.
