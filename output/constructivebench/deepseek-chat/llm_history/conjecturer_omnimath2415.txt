Looking at the problem, we need to count integer solutions (x,y,z) to x+y+z=525 with divisibility constraints. The divisibility conditions reduce the problem to counting solutions to 7a + 5b + 3c = 525 where a,b,c ∈ ℤ. The number of solutions grows linearly with the right-hand side, suggesting the answer is proportional to 525. From enumeration patterns, the coefficient appears to be 5.

<<<525 / 21 + 1>>>
