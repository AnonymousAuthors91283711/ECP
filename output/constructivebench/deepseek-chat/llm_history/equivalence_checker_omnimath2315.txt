open Finset

abbrev omnimath2315_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2315 : 
  card {s : Finset (Fin 3 × Fin 2) | s.Nonempty} = omnimath2315_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 44
Proposed Answer: 2^6 - 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the number of non-empty subsets of Fin 3 × Fin 2, which has 3 × 2 = 6 elements.

2. The total number of subsets of a set with 6 elements is 2^6 = 64.

3. The number of non-empty subsets would be 2^6 - 1 = 63 (subtracting 1 for the empty set).

4. However, the ground truth answer is given as 44, which contradicts this standard combinatorial result.

The proposed answer (2^6 - 1 = 63) is mathematically correct for counting non-empty subsets of a 6-element set. The ground truth answer of 44 appears to be incorrect for this interpretation of the problem.
