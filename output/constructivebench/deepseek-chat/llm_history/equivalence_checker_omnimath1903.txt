Ground Truth Answer: 21
Proposed Answer: 18
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal length of a sequence of 0s and 1s where:
   - The sequence starts with (0,1) as initial state
   - Each 0 copies the current count to clipboard
   - Each 1 adds the clipboard value to count
   - We need to reach count ≥ 2018
   - Every 1 must be preceded by a 0 earlier in the sequence

2. This is essentially a "fastest way to reach a number" problem using copy-paste operations, with the constraint that each paste must be preceded by a copy.

3. The optimal strategy would be:
   - Start with 0 (copy initial 1)
   - Then sequences of 1s (pastes) preceded by 0s (copies)
   - The minimal sequence would follow a pattern like: 0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,...

4. The ground truth answer of 21 makes sense because:
   - It's the minimal length needed to reach ≥2018 under these constraints
   - The proposed answer of 18 is too short to reach this number with the given constraints
