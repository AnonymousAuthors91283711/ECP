From the problem statement, we can see:
1. We have a triangle ABC with sides AB=8, BC=15, AC=17
2. The area of ABC is given as 60
3. We need to find areaABC / 4 as the final answer
4. The enumerated answer is 15 (60/4)

The error in the current proposed answer is due to incorrect formatting of the theorem statement. The correct answer should simply be the value 15 as a Real number.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<15>>> 

Explanation:
- The triangle ABC is right-angled (since 8² + 15² = 17²)
- Its area is correctly given as (8*15)/2 = 60
- The problem asks for area/4 = 60/4 = 15
- The answer is a simple Real number constant
- The error was in the theorem statement formatting, not the answer value itself[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
