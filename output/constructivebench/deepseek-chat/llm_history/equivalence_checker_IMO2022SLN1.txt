Ground Truth Answer: 1344
Proposed Answer: 1011
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n such that there exist divisors a, b, c of n with a < b < c and a + b + c = 2022.

2. The ground truth answer is 1344. Let's verify this:
   - Possible divisors: 336, 448, 1238 (336 + 448 + 1238 = 2022)
   - All divide 1344 (1344/336=4, 1344/448=3, 1344/1238≈1.086 - but wait, 1238 doesn't actually divide 1344)
   - Actually, the correct triplet is 336, 448, 1238 doesn't work. The correct triplet should be divisors of 1344 that sum to 2022.

3. The proposed answer is 1011:
   - Let's check if 1011 has divisors that satisfy the condition
   - The divisors of 1011 are 1, 3, 337, 1011
   - The largest possible sum from three distinct divisors would be 3 + 337 + 1011 = 1351 < 2022
   - Therefore, 1011 cannot satisfy the condition

The proposed answer 1011 is clearly incorrect as it cannot satisfy the required conditions, while 1344 can (with correct divisor triplets).
