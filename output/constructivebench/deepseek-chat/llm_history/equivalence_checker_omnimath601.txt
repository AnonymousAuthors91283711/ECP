noncomputable abbrev omnimath601_answer : Set ℂ := sorry
theorem omnimath601 : 
  {s : ℂ | ∃ (r : ℂ), s = 1 / (1 - r) ∧ r ^ 2013 = 1 / (2013 : ℂ) ^ 2013} = omnimath601_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: { (2013 : ℂ) ^ 2014 / ((2013 : ℂ) ^ 2013 - 1) }
Proposed Answer: {s : ℂ | ∃ k : Fin 2013, s = 1 / (1 - (1 / 2013) * exp (2 * Real.pi * I * k / 2013))}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the set of complex numbers s that can be expressed as s = 1/(1-r) where r is a root of r^2013 = 1/2013^2013.

2. The ground truth answer gives a single value: 2013^2014/(2013^2013 - 1). This would be correct if there was only one possible s value.

3. The proposed answer gives a set of 2013 values, corresponding to the 2013 roots of unity scaled by 1/2013. This correctly accounts for all 2013 roots of the equation r^2013 = 1/2013^2013.

The ground truth answer is incorrect because it only provides one solution when there should be 2013 distinct solutions (one for each root). The proposed answer correctly identifies all solutions.
