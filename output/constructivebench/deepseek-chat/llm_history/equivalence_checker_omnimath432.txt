Ground Truth Answer: fun (a, b) => a + b - Nat.gcd a b
Proposed Answer: fun (a, b) => (b / Nat.gcd a b) + (a / Nat.gcd a b)
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer is: a + b - gcd(a, b)
The proposed answer is: (b / gcd(a, b)) + (a / gcd(a, b))

Let's simplify both expressions:

1. Ground truth: a + b - gcd(a, b)
2. Proposed: (a + b)/gcd(a, b)

These are not equivalent expressions. For example, take a=4, b=6:
- Ground truth: 4 + 6 - 2 = 8
- Proposed: (4 + 6)/2 = 5

The proposed answer gives a smaller result, which would be incorrect for the problem since we're looking for the least sum x+y where x*b = y*a. The correct minimal sum should indeed be a + b - gcd(a, b), as this represents the minimal solution to the linear Diophantine equation.
