Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to fix the proposed answer to properly represent a real number in Lean. The error suggests we need to make the division operation explicit for real numbers. The problem involves solving a system of equations where g = p + 1 and 14*(g + p) = 546, which leads to g = 39/2.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<39 / (2 : ℝ)>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem gives us two equations: g = p + 1 and 14*(g + p) = 546
2. Substituting the first equation into the second: 14*(p + 1 + p) = 546 → 14*(2p + 1) = 546
3. Solving gives p = 37/2, and thus g = p + 1 = 39/2
4. The error occurred because Lean needs explicit type annotation for real number division
5. By adding (2 : ℝ), we ensure the division is performed in the real numbers rather than natural numbers[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem statement and error message, we need to provide a real number solution to the equation system. The problem gives us two conditions:
1. g = p + 1
2. 14 * (g + p) = 546

From the first equation, we can substitute g in the second equation:
14 * ((p + 1) + p) = 546
14 * (2p + 1) = 546
2p + 1 = 39
2p = 38
p = 19

Then from the first equation:
g = 19 + 1 = 20

The theorem states this should equal P2003AMCB_2_answer, so the answer should be 20. The error occurs because we need to mark Real division as noncomputable.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<20>>>
