Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n - 3
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n - 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal number of "dominant" vertices in a graph of size n=1982, where a dominant vertex is connected to all others, and every 4-vertex subset contains at least one dominant vertex.

2. The ground truth answer suggests that for a graph of size n, the minimal number of such dominant vertices is n-3.

3. The proposed answer claims it's n-1.

The difference is significant:
- n-3 means almost all vertices are dominant (only 3 aren't)
- n-1 means exactly one vertex isn't dominant

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. The condition only requires that every 4-vertex subset contains at least one dominant vertex
2. We can satisfy this with fewer dominant vertices (n-3) by carefully constructing the graph
3. n-1 is too restrictive and represents a stronger condition than required
