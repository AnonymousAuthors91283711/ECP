Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

The equation is: 3^(x+2) + 2^(x+2) + 2^x = 2^(x+5) + 3^x

We can simplify both sides:
Left side: 9*3^x + 4*2^x + 2^x = 9*3^x + 5*2^x
Right side: 32*2^x + 3^x

So the equation becomes: 9*3^x + 5*2^x = 32*2^x + 3^x
Which simplifies to: 8*3^x = 27*2^x
Or: (3/2)^x = 27/8
Since 27/8 = (3/2)^3, we get x = 3

The ground truth answer is 3, while the proposed answer is 2. These are clearly different values.
