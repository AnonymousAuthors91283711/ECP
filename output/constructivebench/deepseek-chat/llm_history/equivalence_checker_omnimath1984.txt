Ground Truth Answer: 1536
Proposed Answer: 1984
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the greatest natural number n < 2012 where for every divisor d of n, the binary representation of d contains at most two '1's.

2. The ground truth answer is 1536. Let's verify this:
   - 1536 = 2^9 * 3
   - Its divisors are all numbers of form 2^a * 3^b where 0 ≤ a ≤ 9, 0 ≤ b ≤ 1
   - All these divisors in binary will have:
     - Either just powers of 2 (single '1')
     - Or powers of 2 plus 3 (which is 11 in binary, adding one more '1')
     - So maximum '1's is 2

3. The proposed answer is 1984:
   - 1984 = 2^6 * 31
   - 31 in binary is 11111 (five '1's)
   - So 31 is a divisor of 1984 whose binary representation violates the condition
   - Therefore 1984 cannot be the correct answer
