The error occurs because the proposed answer tries to use `p` as a variable in the definition of `mathodyssey127_answer`, but `p` isn't in scope at that point. The answer needs to be a function that takes `p` as an argument.

Looking at the problem statement and the conditions:
1. We have probabilities P1, P2, P3 involving binomial coefficients
2. The condition P1 = P2 ∧ P1 ≠ 0 implies a relationship between p and (1-p)
3. The theorem asks for P3 in terms of p when P1 = P2

From the enumerated answers and the pattern, when P1 = P2, we can derive that p must satisfy a specific ratio (in this case p = 1/2 would make P1 = P2). The final answer for P3 should be expressed as a function of p.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<fun (p : ℝ) => 5 * p ^ 3 * (1 - p) ^ 2>>>

Explanation:
1. The answer needs to be a function of p since p is a parameter in the problem
2. The form matches P3's definition (hP3) but generalized
3. When P1 = P2, this simplifies to the given expression
4. The coefficient 5 comes from choose(5,3) = 10, but there's likely additional simplification from the P1=P2 condition[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem statement and error message, I notice:
1. The theorem requires `mathodyssey127_answer` to be of type ℝ (a real number), but the proposed answer is a function ℝ → ℝ
2. The enumerated answers suggest we need a constant value, not a function
3. The conditions P1=P2 and P1≠0 imply we need to solve for p when these probabilities are equal

From P1 = P2, we get:
5p(1-p)^4 = 10p^2(1-p)^3
Simplifying gives p = 1/3 (since 0<p<1)

Substituting p=1/3 into P3 gives the constant value we need.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<10 * (1 / 3) ^ 3 * (2 / 3) ^ 2>>>

Explanation:
1. Solved P1=P2 to find p=1/3
2. Plugged p=1/3 into P3 expression
3. Simplified to get exact value (10*(1/3)^3*(2/3)^2)
4. This is a constant ℝ value matching the required type
