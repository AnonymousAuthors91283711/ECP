theorem P2025HMMTfeb_team_9 (p : ℕ) :
  Nat.Prime p ∧ (∃ f : ℤ → ℤ, 
    (∀ x, f (x + p) = f x) ∧ 
    (∀ x, (f (x + f x) - x) % p = 0)) ↔ p ∈ P2025HMMTfeb_team_9_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {p | Nat.Prime p ∧ (p = 5 ∨ p % 5 = 1 ∨ p % 5 = 4)}
Proposed Answer: {p | ∃ k : ℕ, p = k + 1 ∧ k ∣ k + 1}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding all prime numbers p for which there exists a periodic function f (with period p) satisfying a certain functional equation modulo p.

2. The ground truth answer states that the primes are either:
   - Equal to 5, or
   - Congruent to 1 mod 5, or
   - Congruent to 4 mod 5

3. The proposed answer gives a completely different condition about numbers p where p = k+1 and k divides k+1. This would imply p = 2 (since 1 divides 2) or p = 3 (since 2 divides 3), etc., but these don't match the ground truth.

4. Checking the first few primes:
   - 2: Not in ground truth, but in proposed (k=1)
   - 3: Not in ground truth, but in proposed (k=2)
   - 5: In ground truth, not in proposed (no k where k divides k+1 gives 5)
   - 7: Not in ground truth (7%5=2), not in proposed
   - 11: In ground truth (11%5=1), not in proposed

The answers are clearly different in their characterization of primes.
