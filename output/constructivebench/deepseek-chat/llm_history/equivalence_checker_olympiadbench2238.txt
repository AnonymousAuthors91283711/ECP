Ground Truth Answer: {-1, 0, 1}
Proposed Answer: {x : ℤ | x^2 = 0 ∨ x^2 = 1 ∨ x^2 = 2}
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem asks to find all integer solutions to (x²-3)(x²+5) < 0.

2. The ground truth answer is {-1, 0, 1}, which are indeed the integers that satisfy the inequality:
   - For x = -1, 0, 1: (x²-3) is negative and (x²+5) is positive, making product negative
   - For |x| ≥ 2: (x²-3) becomes non-negative, making product non-negative

3. The proposed answer is {x : ℤ | x² = 0 ∨ x² = 1 ∨ x² = 2}:
   - This would correspond to x ∈ {-√2, -1, 0, 1, √2} ∩ ℤ = {-1, 0, 1}
   - The x²=2 case is incorrect since √2 is not an integer, and x²=2 doesn't satisfy the original inequality

The proposed answer is mostly correct but includes an extraneous condition (x²=2) that doesn't contribute to the solution set. The actual solution set matches the ground truth, but the proposed answer's formulation is slightly incorrect.
