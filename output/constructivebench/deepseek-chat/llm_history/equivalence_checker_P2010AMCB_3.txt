  Nat.card {x : ℕ | ∃ (a b : ℕ), a * x = 48 ∧ b * x = 64} = P2010AMCB_3_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 5
Proposed Answer: 16
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

The problem is asking for the number of natural numbers x such that:
1. x divides 48 (from a*x=48)
2. x divides 64 (from b*x=64)

So we're looking for the number of common divisors of 48 and 64.

Let's find the divisors:
- Divisors of 48: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48
- Divisors of 64: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64

Common divisors: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 → total of 5

The ground truth answer is 5, which is correct.
The proposed answer is 16, which is incorrect (16 is just the largest common divisor, not the count).
