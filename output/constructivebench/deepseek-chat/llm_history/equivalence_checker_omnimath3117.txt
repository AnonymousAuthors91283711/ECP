Ground Truth Answer: 1 / 2
Proposed Answer: -1.5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest value of (x + y)/x under the constraints -4 ≤ x ≤ -2 and 2 ≤ y ≤ 4.

2. The ground truth answer is 1/2 (0.5).

3. The proposed answer is -1.5.

Analysis:
- The expression (x + y)/x can be rewritten as 1 + y/x.
- Since x is negative and y is positive, y/x is negative.
- To maximize 1 + y/x, we need to minimize the absolute value of y/x.
- This occurs when x is largest (closest to 0) and y is smallest:
  - At x = -2, y = 2: (x + y)/x = (-2 + 2)/-2 = 0
  - At x = -2, y = 4: (-2 + 4)/-2 = 2/-2 = -1
  - At x = -4, y = 2: (-4 + 2)/-4 = -2/-4 = 0.5
  - At x = -4, y = 4: (-4 + 4)/-4 = 0

The maximum value is indeed 0.5 (1/2), which occurs at x = -4, y = 2. The proposed answer of -1.5 is incorrect.
