Ground Truth Answer: 2 * (sqrt 2 - 1)
Proposed Answer: 1 / sqrt 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

The problem is asking for the greatest radius r such that for some center point c, all points p within distance r from c satisfy |p₁ + |p₂|| ≤ 1. This describes finding the largest circle that can fit within the region defined by |x + |y|| ≤ 1.

The ground truth answer is 2*(√2 - 1) ≈ 0.828
The proposed answer is 1/√2 ≈ 0.707

These are clearly different numerical values. The correct answer should be the distance from the origin to the line x + y = 1 (which is 1/√2) plus the distance from (1,0) to the point where the circle is tangent to x + y = 1 (which gives the additional √2 - 1). This sums to 2*(√2 - 1).

The proposed answer only gives the distance from origin to the line, missing the additional component needed for the maximal radius.
