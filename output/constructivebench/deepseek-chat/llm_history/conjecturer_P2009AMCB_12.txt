Looking at the problem, we have a geometric sequence defined by geometric n = a * r^n, with two given terms:
- geometric 5 = 7!
- geometric 8 = 8!

To find 'a', we can set up equations:
1. a * r^5 = 7!
2. a * r^8 = 8!

Dividing equation 2 by equation 1 gives r^3 = 8!/7! = 8, so r = 8^(1/3) = 2.

Substituting back into equation 1: a * 2^5 = 7! → a = 7! / 32.

The error in the original proposed answer comes from using non-integer exponents (5/3) which makes the computation non-executable in Lean. We should use the simplified exact form.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<7! / 2^5>>>

Explanation:
1. From the ratio of terms, we derived r = 2
2. Substituted into the first equation to solve for a
3. Simplified to exact rational form (7! / 32) rather than keeping fractional exponents
4. This form is computable in Lean and matches the exact solution[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the problem statement, we're dealing with a geometric sequence where:
1. The general term is geometric n = a * r^n
2. We know geometric 5 = 7! and geometric 8 = 8!

To find 'a', we can set up equations:
a * r^5 = 7! 
a * r^8 = 8!

Dividing the second equation by the first gives r^3 = 8!/7! = 8
Thus r = 2 (since 2^3 = 8)

Substituting back into the first equation: a * 2^5 = 7! → a = 7!/2^5

The error suggests we need to make this noncomputable since it involves real division. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable def P2009AMCB_12_answer : ℝ := (7! : ℝ) / (2^5 : ℝ)>>>

Explanation:
1. We cast the factorials and powers to ℝ to ensure real division
2. We mark it as noncomputable since real division isn't computable in Lean
3. The answer follows from solving the geometric sequence equations
4. The enumerated answers weren't provided, but the mathematical derivation gives us confidence in this solution[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem, we need to find the initial term 'a' of a geometric sequence where:
1. geometric 5 = 7! = a * r^5
2. geometric 8 = 8! = a * r^8

To find 'a', we can first solve for 'r' by dividing the second equation by the first:
(8!)/(7!) = r^(8-5) => 8 = r^3 => r = 2

Then substitute r back into the first equation:
7! = a * 2^5 => a = 7!/2^5

The error in the original proposal was due to incorrect syntax (repeating the definition and using 'noncomputable' incorrectly). Here's the corrected version:

<<<(7! : ℝ) / (2^5 : ℝ)>>>

Explanation:
1. The sequence is geometric with general term a*r^n
2. From given conditions, we derive r = 2 by solving (8!)/(7!) = r^3
3. Substituting back gives a = 7!/2^5
4. The answer is cast to ℝ since factorials are natural numbers
5. The expression is simplified to its final form without redundant definitions[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the problem statement, we're dealing with a geometric sequence where:
- geometric 5 = 7! = a * r^5
- geometric 8 = 8! = a * r^8

To find 'a', we can divide the two equations to eliminate 'a':
(8!)/(7!) = (a*r^8)/(a*r^5) => 8 = r^3 => r = 2

Then substitute r back into the first equation:
7! = a * 2^5 => a = 7!/2^5

The error occurs because we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real division. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2009AMCB_12_answer : ℝ := (7! : ℝ) / (2^5 : ℝ)>>>

The explanation is that we derived 'a' by solving the system of equations from the geometric sequence definition, using the given values at n=5 and n=8. The noncomputable annotation is necessary because real number division in Lean isn't computable in general.
