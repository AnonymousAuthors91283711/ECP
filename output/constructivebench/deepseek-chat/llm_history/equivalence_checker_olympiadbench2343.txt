Ground Truth Answer: 26
Proposed Answer: 25
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find a unique natural number k between 2 and 40 that satisfies the equation:
   (k*(k-1))/(40*39) = 5/12

2. Let's solve the equation:
   k(k-1)/1560 = 5/12
   => k(k-1) = (5*1560)/12
   => k(k-1) = 650
   => k² - k - 650 = 0

3. Solving the quadratic equation:
   k = [1 ± √(1 + 2600)]/2
   k = [1 ± √2601]/2
   k = [1 ± 51]/2

4. The positive solution is:
   k = (1 + 51)/2 = 26

The ground truth answer is 26, which correctly solves the equation. The proposed answer is 25, which does not satisfy the equation since:
25*24/1560 = 600/1560 ≈ 0.3846 ≠ 5/12 ≈ 0.4167
