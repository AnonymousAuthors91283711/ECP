Ground Truth Answer: (9, 10)
Proposed Answer: (200, 201)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding a unique rational number r (in reduced form) that satisfies certain conditions related to infinite series.

2. The conditions are:
   - There exists a non-zero 'a' such that the infinite series ∑(a*r^n) converges to 2005
   - The series of squares ∑(a*r^n)^2 converges to 20050
   - r must be expressed as a reduced fraction (coprime numerator and denominator)

3. For a geometric series ∑(a*r^n) to converge, we need |r| < 1. The sum would be a/(1-r) = 2005.

4. The sum of squares would be a^2/(1-r^2) = 20050.

5. Solving these equations:
   - From first equation: a = 2005(1-r)
   - Substitute into second: (2005(1-r))^2/(1-r^2) = 20050
   - Simplify to get: 2005(1-r)/(1+r) = 10
   - Solving gives r = 1995/2015 = 399/403 (simplified)

6. However, the ground truth answer is (9,10), which would give r = 0.9
   - Checking: a/(1-0.9) = 2005 ⇒ a = 200.5
   - Sum of squares: (200.5)^2/(1-0.81) = 40200.25/0.19 ≈ 211580.26 ≠ 20050
   - This doesn't match the problem conditions

7. The proposed answer (200,201) gives r ≈ 0.995
   - This is very close to 1, making the series barely convergent
   - Calculations would show it doesn't satisfy the exact conditions either

Both answers appear incorrect based on the mathematical conditions. However, the ground truth is stated as (9,10), suggesting there might be additional context or a different interpretation of the problem.
