Looking at the problem constraints and enumerated answers, we need to find the greatest y that satisfies all conditions. The key observations are:
1. d must be a square between 1300-1400 (only 36²=1296 and 37²=1369 fit, but 1369 is the only one ≥1300)
2. s must be a square between 1400-1500 (only 38²=1444 fits)
3. y must be in [max(d,s), min(d+110,s+110)] = [1444, min(1479,1554)] = [1444,1479]
4. y-d and y-s must be squares

The largest y in [1444,1479] satisfying y-1369 and y-1444 are squares is 1476 (since 1476-1369=107 isn't square, but 1444+32²=1444+1024=2468 is too big, so likely 1444+5²=1469 is the answer).
