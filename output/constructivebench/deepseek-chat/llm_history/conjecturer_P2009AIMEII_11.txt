From the problem statement and error message, I can see that:
1. The problem asks for the greatest product m*n where certain conditions about logarithms and cardinality hold
2. The error shows we need a concrete ℕ value, not a function
3. The enumerated answer hint suggests 50*51 = 2550 is relevant
4. The conditions involve a set of size 50 and logarithmic inequalities

The key insight is that the condition |log m - log k| < log n defines an interval (m/n, m*n), and we want exactly 50 integers k in this interval. The optimal case occurs when m = n+1, making the interval (1+1/n, n(n+1)). For n=50, this gives exactly 50 integers (from 2 to 51).

Thus, the maximal product is when n=50 and m=51, giving 50*51=2550.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<2550>>>

Explanation:
- The problem seeks the maximal m*n where there are exactly 50 positive integers k satisfying |log(m/k)| < log(n)
- This occurs when the interval (m/n, m*n) contains exactly 50 integers
- The optimal configuration is m = n+1 = 51 when n=50, making the product 2550
- The answer is a concrete natural number, not a function
