Ground Truth Answer: {70, 110}
Proposed Answer: {x | x = 20 ∨ x = 80}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for all real x between 0 and 360 that satisfy the trigonometric equation:
   √3 * cos(10°) = cos(40°) + sin(x°)

2. The ground truth answer is {70, 110}, meaning these two angles satisfy the equation.

3. The proposed answer is {20, 80}, which are different values.

Let's verify the ground truth:
For x = 70°:
√3 cos(10°) ≈ 1.732 * 0.9848 ≈ 1.705
cos(40°) + sin(70°) ≈ 0.7660 + 0.9397 ≈ 1.7057 (matches)

For x = 110°:
cos(40°) + sin(110°) ≈ 0.7660 + 0.9397 ≈ 1.7057 (same as above, since sin(110°) = sin(70°))

Now check proposed answer:
For x = 20°:
cos(40°) + sin(20°) ≈ 0.7660 + 0.3420 ≈ 1.1080 ≠ 1.7057

For x = 80°:
cos(40°) + sin(80°) ≈ 0.7660 + 0.9848 ≈ 1.7508 ≠ 1.7057

The proposed answer gives values that don't satisfy the equation, while the ground truth values do.
