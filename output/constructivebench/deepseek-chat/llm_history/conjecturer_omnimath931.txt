Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 7, which is at "omnimath931_answer :" in "abbrev omnimath931_answer : ℝ := 12 * Real.sqrt 5", there is an error: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.sqrt', and it does not have executable code.

The error occurs because `Real.sqrt` is a noncomputable operation in Lean, so any definition using it must be marked as `noncomputable`. The proposed answer `12 * Real.sqrt 5` appears correct based on the problem constraints:
1. From `e/f = 3/4`, we can express `e = (3/4)f`
2. Substituting into the second equation and solving gives `f^2 = 144` and `e^2 = 81`
3. Thus `e*f = (3/4)f * f = (3/4)*144 = 108`, but this contradicts the proposed answer
4. Wait, this suggests the proposed answer might be incorrect - let's re-examine:
   - From `sqrt(e^2 + f^2) = 15` and `e = (3/4)f`, we get `sqrt((9/16)f^2 + f^2) = 15`
   - This simplifies to `sqrt((25/16)f^2) = 15` ⇒ `(5/4)|f| = 15` ⇒ `f = ±12`
   - Then `e = ±9`, so `e*f = 108` (same sign) or `-108` (opposite signs)
   - Therefore the correct answer should be `108` (assuming positive case)

<<<108>>>
