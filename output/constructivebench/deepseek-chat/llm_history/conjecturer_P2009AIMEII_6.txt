Looking at the problem, we need to count 5-element subsets of {1,...,14} containing at least one pair of consecutive numbers. The total number of 5-element subsets is C(14,5). The number without any consecutive pairs is C(10,5) (using stars and bars). Thus the answer is C(14,5) - C(10,5).

<<<choose 14 5 - choose 10 5>>>
