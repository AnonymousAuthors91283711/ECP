Ground Truth Answer: {6}
Proposed Answer: {n | n ≥ 2 ∧ Squarefree n}
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for all natural numbers n ≥ 2 where the sum of divisors divided by the largest prime factor equals n itself.

2. The ground truth answer is {6}, meaning only 6 satisfies this condition.

3. The proposed answer is all squarefree numbers ≥ 2.

Analysis:
- For n=6: 
  - Divisors: 1,2,3,6 → sum=12
  - Largest prime factor: 3
  - 12/3 = 4 ≠ 6 → Wait, this contradicts the ground truth!
  - Actually, 12/3=4, but 4≠6, so 6 shouldn't satisfy the condition. There seems to be a discrepancy here.

However, let's test the condition:
- The condition is (sum of divisors)/largest_prime = n
- For squarefree numbers, the sum of divisors is product of (p+1) for primes p dividing n
- For n=6 (squarefree): (2+1)(3+1)=12, largest prime=3 → 12/3=4≠6
- For n=10 (squarefree): (2+1)(5+1)=18, largest prime=5 → 18/5=3.6≠10
- For n=2: sum=3, largest prime=2 → 3/2=1.5≠2

The proposed answer (squarefree numbers) clearly doesn't match the condition, as none of them satisfy it except possibly some special case. The ground truth says only 6 satisfies it, but our calculation shows even 6 doesn't satisfy the condition. There might be an error in the problem statement or ground truth.

Given the information:
- The proposed answer is incorrect as it includes many numbers that don't satisfy the condition
- The ground truth claims only 6 satisfies it, but our calculation shows it doesn't
