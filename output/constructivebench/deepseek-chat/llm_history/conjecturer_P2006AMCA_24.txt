Looking at the problem, we need to count triples (a,b,c) where a+b+c=2006 and b+c is even. Since b+c must be even, a must also be even (because 2006 is even). The number of solutions is equivalent to counting pairs (b,c) for each even a, where b+c=2006-a. For each even a, there are 2006-a+1 possible (b,c) pairs. Summing over even a gives the answer.
