Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
- We're looking for numbers between 1 and 10 (inclusive) where 5 divides (a^2014 + a^2015)
- This can be rewritten as a^2014(1 + a) ≡ 0 mod 5
- So either a ≡ 0 mod 5 or a ≡ 4 mod 5 (since 1 + 4 ≡ 0 mod 5)

Numbers in 1-10 satisfying:
1. a ≡ 0 mod 5: 5, 10
2. a ≡ 4 mod 5: 4, 9

Total satisfying numbers: 4 (4, 5, 9, 10)

The ground truth answer is 4, while the proposed answer is 2. The proposed answer is incorrect as it's missing some valid numbers.

<<<False>>>
