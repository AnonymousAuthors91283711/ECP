<<<100>>> 

Explanation: The pattern from enumeration suggests the answer is always 100. This makes sense because for n=100, the product contains 100*101*...*200, which includes 100^2 as a factor (from 100 and 200). For n>100, no perfect square in [n,n+100] will divide the product since the product contains primes larger than the square root.
