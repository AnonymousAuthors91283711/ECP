Ground Truth Answer: 4096
Proposed Answer: 2^24
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n > 0 where the floor of n^(1/k) is distinct for all k ∈ {1,2,...,8} when k ≠ l.

2. The ground truth answer is 4096.

3. The proposed answer is 2^24, which equals 16,777,216.

Let's verify:
- For n=4096 (2^12):
  - floor(4096^(1/1)) = 4096
  - floor(4096^(1/2)) = 64
  - floor(4096^(1/3)) = 16
  - floor(4096^(1/4)) = 8
  - floor(4096^(1/5)) ≈ 5.03 → 5
  - floor(4096^(1/6)) ≈ 4.00 → 4
  - floor(4096^(1/7)) ≈ 3.28 → 3
  - floor(4096^(1/8)) ≈ 2.82 → 2
  All distinct, and it's the smallest such number.

- For n=2^24=16,777,216:
  This is much larger than 4096 and clearly not the smallest solution.

The proposed answer is incorrect as it's not the minimal solution.
