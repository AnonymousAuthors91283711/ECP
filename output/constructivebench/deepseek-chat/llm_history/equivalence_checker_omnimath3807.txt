Ground Truth Answer: {(3, 1, 2, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1, 1, 1), (2, 1, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2, 1)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all quadruples (x,y,z,t) of positive integers satisfying 2^x * 3^y + 5^z = 7^t.

2. Ground Truth Answer provides only one solution: (3,1,2,2). Let's verify it:
   2³ * 3¹ + 5² = 8*3 + 25 = 24 + 25 = 49 = 7² → Correct

3. Proposed Answer provides four solutions. Let's check each:
   - (1,1,1,1): 2*3 + 5 = 11 ≠ 7 → Incorrect
   - (2,1,1,1): 4*3 + 5 = 17 ≠ 7 → Incorrect
   - (1,2,1,1): 2*9 + 5 = 23 ≠ 7 → Incorrect
   - (1,1,2,1): 2*3 + 25 = 31 ≠ 7 → Incorrect

None of the proposed solutions satisfy the equation, while the ground truth solution does. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
