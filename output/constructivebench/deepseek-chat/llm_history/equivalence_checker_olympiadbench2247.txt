Ground Truth Answer: fun ⟨x, y⟩ => 15 - y / x
Proposed Answer: fun (x, y) => y - x
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function z = f(x,y) where x ∈ [2,5] and y ∈ [10,20], and claims that the maximum value of z in this domain is 13.

2. Ground Truth Answer: z = 15 - y/x
   - To find maximum, we'd minimize y/x
   - y/x is minimized when x is max (5) and y is min (10)
   - So min y/x = 10/5 = 2
   - Thus max z = 15 - 2 = 13 (matches the theorem)

3. Proposed Answer: z = y - x
   - To find maximum, we'd maximize y and minimize x
   - Max y = 20, min x = 2
   - So max z = 20 - 2 = 18 ≠ 13

The proposed answer gives a different maximum value (18) than what's stated in the theorem (13), and the functional form is completely different from the ground truth.
