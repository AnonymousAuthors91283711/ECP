Ground Truth Answer: 50
Proposed Answer: 3 * 14 + 0 * 11 + 3 * 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the maximum value of v = 14a + 11b + 2c under the constraints:
   - a, b, c ≤ 20
   - 5a + 4b + c ≤ 18

2. Ground Truth Answer is 50, which can be achieved by:
   - a = 3, b = 0, c = 3
   - v = 14*3 + 11*0 + 2*3 = 42 + 0 + 6 = 48 (but this doesn't match 50)
   Wait, this seems incorrect.

3. The proposed answer is 3*14 + 0*11 + 3*2 = 48, which is less than the ground truth answer of 50.

4. The actual maximum is indeed 50, achieved by:
   - a = 2, b = 2, c = 0
   - v = 14*2 + 11*2 + 2*0 = 28 + 22 + 0 = 50
   - Constraints check: 5*2 + 4*2 + 0 = 10 + 8 = 18 ≤ 18

The proposed answer gives 48, which is less than the actual maximum of 50. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
