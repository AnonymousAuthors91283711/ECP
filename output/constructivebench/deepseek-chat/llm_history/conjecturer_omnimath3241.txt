From the problem context, we're looking for the dimension of a space of balanced bivariate polynomials with degree ≤ 2009. The balanced condition implies harmonicity (Laplace equation), and for bivariate polynomials, harmonic polynomials of degree d have dimension 2 when d ≥ 1. Summing over odd degrees (since even degrees don't satisfy the integral condition) up to 2009 gives the answer.
