Ground Truth Answer: fun k =>
  if Even k then 100^2 - (2*k - 100)^2
  else (100^2 - (2*k - 100)^2) / 2
Proposed Answer: fun k => if k % 2 = 1 then 10000 else if k % 4 = 2 then 5000 else 2500
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting reachable points on a 100x100 grid where movement is either ±1 in x and ±k in y, or ±k in x and ±1 in y.

2. The ground truth answer:
   - For even k: 100² - (2k - 100)²
   - For odd k: (100² - (2k - 100)²)/2

3. The proposed answer:
   - If k is odd (k % 2 = 1): 10000 (all points reachable)
   - If k ≡ 2 mod 4: 5000
   - If k ≡ 0 mod 4: 2500

Comparison:
- For odd k: The ground truth gives a varying value depending on k, while proposed answer always gives 10000. This is incorrect as not all points are reachable for odd k.
- For even k: The proposed answer gives fixed values (5000 or 2500) based on k mod 4, while the ground truth gives a formula that varies with k. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth's behavior.

The proposed answer is completely different from the ground truth, with no cases where they agree.
