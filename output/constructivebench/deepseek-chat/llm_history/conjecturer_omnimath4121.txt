  (∀ x y : ℚ, 0 < x → 0 < y → f (f x^2 * y) = x^3 * f (x * y)) ↔ f = omnimath4121_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ → ℚ
From the functional equation and the pattern of enumerated solutions, the answer appears to be a simple power function. The equation suggests homogeneity, and the exponents work out when f is a monomial. The solution must satisfy f(x) = c*x^n, and plugging this into the equation gives n=3/2.
