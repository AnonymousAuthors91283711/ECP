theorem omnimath2716 (c : ℤ) (h : (X ^ 2 + 12 * X + C c).IsRoot 18) :
    (X ^ 2 + 12 * X + C c).IsRoot (omnimath2716_answer c) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun c => -12 - 18  -- For x² + 12x + c, sum of roots is -12, so other root is -12 - 18
Proposed Answer: fun c : ℤ => -c - 216
Let's analyze both answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer:
- For a quadratic x² + 12x + c, the sum of roots is -12 (by Vieta's formulas)
- Given one root is 18, the other root must be (-12) - 18 = -30
- This is correct and properly derived

2. Proposed Answer:
- The answer suggests the other root is -c - 216
- Let's verify: if one root is 18, then c = product of roots = 18*(-30) = -540
- But -c - 216 = 540 - 216 = 324 ≠ -30
- The proposed answer doesn't match the correct calculation

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't give the right value for the other root. The ground truth answer correctly applies Vieta's formulas.
