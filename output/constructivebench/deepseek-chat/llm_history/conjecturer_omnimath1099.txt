The error in the Lean code is due to incorrect spacing and line breaks in the `let` declarations. In Lean, each `let` should be on its own line or properly separated by semicolons. The mathematical content of the answer is correct - it's simply `1 - (13/16)^5` as derived from the problem statement.

Here's the fixed answer:

<<<1 - (13/16)^5>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem defines p = (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16
2. Then q = 1 - p = 13/16
3. The theorem states q^5 = (13/16)^5 ∧ 1 - q^5 = answer
4. Therefore the answer must be 1 - (13/16)^5
5. The Lean error was just formatting - needed proper line breaks between `let` declarations
6. The enumerated answers confirm this matches the expected pattern
7. The type ℝ is correct since we're working with real number division and exponents[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
