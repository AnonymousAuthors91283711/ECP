theorem omnimath4141 (n : ℕ) :
  (∃ a b : ℕ, b > n ∧ (a^2 + n^2) % (b^2 - n^2) = 0 ∧ (b^2 - n^2) > 0) ↔ n ∈ omnimath4141_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{n | ∃ k, n = k * (k + 1)}>>> 

Explanation: The pattern from enumeration suggests numbers that are products of consecutive integers (pronic numbers). This matches the condition since for n=k(k+1), we can choose a=k²+k and b=k+1 to satisfy the divisibility.
