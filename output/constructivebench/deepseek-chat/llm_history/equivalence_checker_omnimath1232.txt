Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 2004
Let's analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the largest natural number d that divides (2002^n + 2) for all n ≥ 1.

2. The ground truth answer is 6, which is correct because:
   - For any n, 2002 ≡ 4 mod 6, so 2002^n + 2 ≡ 4^n + 2 ≡ 0 mod 6 (since 4 ≡ -2 mod 6, and (-2)^n + 2 is divisible by 6 for all n ≥ 1)
   - No larger number than 6 satisfies this for all n ≥ 1

3. The proposed answer is 2004, which is incorrect because:
   - While 2004 does divide 2002^1 + 2 = 2004
   - It doesn't divide 2002^2 + 2 = 2002*2002 + 2 ≡ (-2)*(-2) + 2 = 6 mod 2004
   - 6 is not divisible by 2004

The proposed answer fails to satisfy the condition for n=2, while the ground truth answer of 6 works for all n.
