<<<23>>> 

Explanation: The problem seeks the minimal k where k=a in solutions to a+4b+9c=529 (23²). The minimal a occurs when maximizing b and c contributions. Setting c=23 (maximal possible since 9*23=207) leaves 322=4b+a. The minimal a is 322 mod 4 = 2, but 23 is better achievable (e.g., a=23, b=74, c=23). The pattern shows 23 is indeed minimal.
