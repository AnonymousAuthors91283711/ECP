Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: 1.5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to calculate the weighted mean of the given scores with their respective weights, then subtract the median (which is given as 85).

2. Calculating the weighted mean:
   - 70 * 0.1 = 7
   - 80 * 0.25 = 20
   - 85 * 0.2 = 17
   - 90 * 0.15 = 13.5
   - 95 * 0.3 = 28.5
   - Sum = 7 + 20 + 17 + 13.5 + 28.5 = 86

3. Subtract the median (85): 86 - 85 = 1

The ground truth answer is correct (1), while the proposed answer (1.5) is incorrect.
