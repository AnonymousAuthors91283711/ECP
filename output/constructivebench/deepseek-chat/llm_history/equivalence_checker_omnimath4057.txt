Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => 
    if a = b ∧ a % 2 = 0 then 2 * (a / 2) + 3
    else max a b + 2
Proposed Answer: fun a b => if a = 1 ∧ b = 1 then 5 else max a b + 2
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. The ground truth answer has two cases:
   - When a = b and a is even: returns 2*(a/2) + 3 (which simplifies to a + 3)
   - Otherwise: returns max a b + 2

2. The proposed answer has two cases:
   - When a = 1 and b = 1: returns 5
   - Otherwise: returns max a b + 2

Comparison:
- For most cases (a ≠ b or a odd), both answers return max a b + 2
- For a = b and a even, ground truth returns a + 3 while proposed returns a + 2 (since max a a = a)
- For a = b = 1 (odd), ground truth returns 1 + 2 = 3, but proposed returns 5
- The proposed answer is only correct when a ≠ b or when a = b but neither is 1

The answers differ in multiple cases (a=b even, a=b=1), and the proposed answer doesn't properly handle the even case. The special case for (1,1) seems arbitrary and incorrect compared to the ground truth.
