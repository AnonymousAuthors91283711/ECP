theorem olympiadbench2333 (p : ℝ) (hp : 0 ≤ p ∧ p ≤ 1) :
    ∃ (a b c d : ℤ), d ≠ 0 ∧ olympiadbench2333_answer p = (a * p^2 + b * p + c) / d := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun p => (1 - p^2) / 3
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℝ => p * (1 - p)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function of p (with 0 ≤ p ≤ 1) that can be expressed as a quadratic polynomial in p with integer coefficients over an integer denominator.

2. The ground truth answer is (1 - p²)/3, which can be rewritten as (-p² + 1)/3, clearly satisfying the required form with a=-1, b=0, c=1, d=3.

3. The proposed answer is p*(1 - p) = -p² + p, which can be written as (-p² + p)/1, satisfying the form with a=-1, b=1, c=0, d=1.

While both answers satisfy the general form required by the theorem statement, they are clearly different functions:
- Ground truth: (1 - p²)/3
- Proposed: p(1 - p)

These are not equivalent functions, as can be seen by testing any value of p (except p=0 and p=0.5 where they coincidentally agree). For example:
- At p=0.2: ground truth = (1-0.04)/3 = 0.32 vs proposed = 0.2*0.8 = 0.16
- At p=0.7: ground truth = (1-0.49)/3 ≈ 0.17 vs proposed = 0.7*0.3 = 0.21
