Ground Truth Answer: 28.00
Proposed Answer: 20 + 0.05 * 100 + 0.1 * max 0 (30.5 * 60 - 1800)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is the exact expression given in the problem statement, which evaluates to 28.00 when computed (20 + 5 + 3 = 28). This matches the ground truth answer of 28.00. The expressions are equivalent.
