The error occurs because Lean requires proper spacing and line breaks between declarations. The proposed answer 9/13 is correct based on the calculation, but we need to fix the formatting in the Lean expression. Here's the corrected version:

<<<9/13>>>

Explanation:
1. Given p = 3/5 and q = 2/5
2. The expression p² / (1 - 2pq) evaluates to:
   (3/5)² / (1 - 2*(3/5)*(2/5)) = (9/25) / (1 - 12/25) = (9/25) / (13/25) = 9/13
3. The error in the original code was due to missing line breaks between the let declarations and the theorem statement
4. The answer 9/13 matches the expected type ℚ (rational numbers) and the calculation[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
