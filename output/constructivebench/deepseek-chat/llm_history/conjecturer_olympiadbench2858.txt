Looking at the equation x² - 8x + y² + 4y = 5, we can complete the squares:
(x-4)² + (y+2)² = 25. This represents a circle centered at (4,-2) with radius 5. The positive integer solutions (x>0, y>0) can be enumerated by considering integer points within this circle. The enumerated answers suggest there are 12 such points.
