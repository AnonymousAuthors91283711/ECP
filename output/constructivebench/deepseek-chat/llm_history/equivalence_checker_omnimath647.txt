abbrev omnimath647_answer : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath647 (a b : ℝ) :
    Collinear ℝ ({![1, a, b], ![a, 2, b], ![a, b, 3]} : Set (Fin 3 → ℝ)) ↔ omnimath647_answer (a, b) = 4 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun (a, b) => a + b
Proposed Answer: fun (a, b) => a * b
To determine whether the proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer, we need to analyze the problem statement and the given answers.

The problem involves checking the collinearity condition for three vectors in ℝ³. The collinearity condition for three vectors can be expressed as the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors being zero. 

The ground truth answer suggests that the condition is satisfied when `a + b = 4`, while the proposed answer suggests `a * b = 4`. 

These are fundamentally different conditions. For example:
- If `a = 1` and `b = 3`, then `a + b = 4` (satisfies ground truth), but `a * b = 3` (does not satisfy proposed answer).
- If `a = 2` and `b = 2`, then `a + b = 4` (satisfies ground truth), and `a * b = 4` (satisfies proposed answer).

Since the conditions are not equivalent for all real numbers `a` and `b`, the answers are not equivalent.
