Ground Truth Answer: { (fun _ => 0, fun _ => 0) } ∪ 
  { (fun x => x^2 + c, fun x => x) | c : ℝ }
Proposed Answer: {(f, g) | ∃ c : ℝ, f = (fun x => c * x) ∧ g = (fun x => c * x)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

The functional equation given is:
∀ x y, g (f (x + y)) = f x + (2 * x + y) * g y

Ground Truth Answer provides two cases:
1. The zero functions (f(x)=0, g(x)=0)
2. Quadratic f(x)=x²+c with linear g(x)=x

Proposed Answer suggests only linear solutions where f and g are proportional to x.

Testing the proposed solution:
For f(x)=c*x, g(x)=c*x, plug into equation:
c*(c*(x+y)) = c*x + (2x+y)*(c*y)
c²(x+y) = c x + c(2xy + y²)
This only holds when c=0 (zero solution), but not for any other c.

The ground truth's quadratic solution satisfies:
For f(x)=x²+c, g(x)=x:
x+y = x² + c + (2x+y)*y
x+y = x² + c + 2xy + y²
This doesn't hold generally, but the ground truth likely meant f(x)=x² and g(x)=x (c=0 case), which does satisfy:
(x+y)² = x² + (2x+y)*y
x²+2xy+y² = x²+2xy+y² ✓

The proposed answer misses the non-trivial solution (f(x)=x², g(x)=x) and incorrectly suggests linear solutions that don't work.
