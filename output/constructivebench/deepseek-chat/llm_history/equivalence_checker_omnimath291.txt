Ground Truth Answer: 4489
Proposed Answer: 1005
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest positive integer n such that there exists a permutation p of {1,...,n} where for every k, (k+1)*p(k) is a perfect square.

2. The ground truth answer is 4489, which is 67². This makes sense because:
   - For such permutations to exist, we need a pairing where each (k+1)*p(k) is square
   - The number 67 is significant because it's a prime that factors into the problem constraints
   - 4489 is the minimal n where such pairings are possible

3. The proposed answer is 1005, which is 3*5*67. While 67 is a factor here, this number is:
   - Much smaller than 4489
   - Doesn't have the necessary properties to satisfy all the permutation conditions
   - Not a square number itself, which is likely required for the solution

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the minimal condition required by the problem.

<<<False>>>
