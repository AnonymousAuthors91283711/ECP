Based on the problem statement and error message, I'll provide a corrected answer. The problem involves analyzing the behavior of sequences involving powers of (√2 + 1) and (√2 + 3) multiplied by a scaling factor s, and determining whether they can converge to integers.

Key observations:
1. (√2 + 1) is a Pisot number (its algebraic conjugate √2 - 1 has absolute value < 1), so its powers times a suitable s can converge to integers
2. (√2 + 3) is not a Pisot number (its conjugate √2 - 3 has absolute value > 1), so no such s exists

The answer should be a pair of booleans indicating:
1. First component: True for (√2 + 1) case (exists such s)
2. Second component: False for (√2 + 3) case (no such s exists)

The error was due to incorrect syntax - we need to directly assign the pair without the <<< >>> delimiters in the definition. Here's the corrected answer:

Based on the problem statement and error message, I notice that:
1. The problem is asking about the existence of scaling factors 's' that make certain sequences converge to 0
2. The first part (√2 + 1) is true (exists such s) while the second part (√2 + 3) is false
3. The answer should be a pair of booleans representing these two facts
4. The error occurs because the proposed answer was empty

The correct answer should be a pair where:
- First component is true (exists s for (√2 + 1)^n)
- Second component is false (no s exists for (√2 + 3)^n)

Here's the fixed answer:

<<<(true, false)>>>

Explanation:
1. For (√2 + 1)^n, we can choose s = (√2 - 1)^n since (√2 + 1)(√2 - 1) = 1, making the product approach 0
2. For (√2 + 3)^n, no such s exists since |√2 + 3| > 1 and any non-zero s would make the product diverge
3. The answer is thus (true, false) representing these two facts
