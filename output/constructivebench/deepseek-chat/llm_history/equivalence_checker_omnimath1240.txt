Ground Truth Answer: 899
Proposed Answer: 73
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two polynomials f and g with specific properties:
   - f is defined as X³ + X + 1
   - g has a root at x if and only if x is the square of a root of f
   - g(0) = -1

2. We need to find g(9). The ground truth answer is 899, while the proposed answer is 73.

3. To verify, let's think about the construction of g:
   - First find the roots of f. Let's call them α, β, γ.
   - Then the roots of g would be α², β², γ².
   - Therefore, g can be written as C(X-α²)(X-β²)(X-γ²), where C is a constant.
   - Using g(0) = -1, we can find C.

4. The value g(9) would be determined by this construction. The ground truth answer 899 comes from proper calculation of this construction, while 73 doesn't match any obvious intermediate step or miscalculation.
