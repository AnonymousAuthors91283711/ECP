Ground Truth Answer: 4027
Proposed Answer: 2013 + 2014 + sqrt 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives an equation relating x and y, and asks for the value of x + y.

2. The ground truth answer is 4027 (which is 2013 + 2014).

3. The proposed answer is 2013 + 2014 + √2.

The key observation is that the equation can be rewritten in terms of new variables a = x - 2013 and b = y - 2014. The equation then becomes ab/(a² + b²) = -1/2. 

Solving this, we find that a = -b (since the equation simplifies to 2ab = -a² - b², which is (a + b)² = 0). Therefore, x - 2013 = -(y - 2014), which leads to x + y = 2013 + 2014 = 4027.

The proposed answer incorrectly adds a √2 term that shouldn't be there. The correct answer is simply 4027.
