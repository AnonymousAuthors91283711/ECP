Looking at the pattern from 2 to 2007, the sum appears to be telescoping. The enumerated answers suggest the general form simplifies to 2007 - 1 = 2006. The answer is:

Based on the problem statement and error message, I notice that:
1. The function `F` is undefined in the problem statement
2. The proposed answer `2006` is simply 2007-1, suggesting the sum might be telescoping
3. The error indicates we need to define `F` properly

Looking at the pattern of 2006 being 2007-1, and considering common competition problems, I conjecture that:
- The sum likely involves terms that cancel out in a telescoping series
- The final result is probably the last term minus the first term (2007-2+1 = 2006)

Here's the corrected answer that should compile:

<<<2006>>>

Explanation:
The answer 2006 suggests a telescoping series where most terms cancel out, leaving only the difference between the upper and lower bounds of the summation (2007 - 2 + 1 = 2006). This is a common pattern in competition math problems involving sums of fractions or differences of terms. While we don't see the exact definition of F, the numerical answer and error message point toward this simple closed-form solution.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
