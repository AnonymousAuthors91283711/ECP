Looking at the problem, we need to find the sum of a series S = ∑' (n+1)/z^(n+1) where z = 1 - 2i. The error in the proposed answer occurs because 'z' is not defined in the global scope - it's only defined within the theorem context.

The series resembles the derivative of a geometric series. The standard geometric series sum is 1/(1-w) for |w|<1. Differentiating gives ∑(n+1)w^n = 1/(1-w)^2. In our case, w = 1/z, so the sum should be 1/(1 - 1/z)^2.

Since z is given as 1 - 2i in the theorem, we can substitute this directly into our answer to make it closed-form. The denominator (1 - 1/z) becomes (1 - 1/(1-2i)), which can be simplified.

Here's the corrected answer that compiles in Lean:

<<<1 / (1 - 1 / (1 - 2 * Complex.I)) ^ 2>>>

Explanation:
1. We recognize the series as a derivative of geometric series
2. The general form would be 1/(1-1/z)^2, but we must substitute z=1-2i
3. This gives us a concrete complex number expression that Lean can handle
4. The answer is now closed-form and doesn't depend on any parameters
