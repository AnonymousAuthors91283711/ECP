Ground Truth Answer: 5
Proposed Answer: 4
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a geometric sequence where:
   - The sum of first 2 terms is 40
   - The sum of first 3 terms is 76
   - The sum of first 4 terms is 130
   - It follows the geometric sequence property for n > 0

2. We need to find how many terms in the first 20 are perfect squares (since ∃ m : ℤ, m = geometric n implies geometric n is a perfect square)

3. Calculating:
   - From h1: g₀ + g₁ = 40
   - From h2: g₂ = 36 ⇒ g₁ * r = 36
   - From h3: g₃ = 54 ⇒ g₂ * r = 54 ⇒ r = 1.5
   - Then g₁ = 36/1.5 = 24, g₀ = 16
   - Sequence: 16, 24, 36, 54, 81, 121.5, ...

4. Perfect squares in first 20 terms:
   - 16 (4²)
   - 36 (6²)
   - 81 (9²)
   - 121.5 is not integer
   - Continuing, we'll find more non-squares until term 5 (≈ 410.06) which isn't square
   - Actually, only 3 perfect squares in first 20 terms (16,36,81)

However, the ground truth says 5 and proposed says 4. Both seem incorrect based on my calculation. But since the ground truth is marked as correct, and proposed is closer to my calculation (though still incorrect), I'll judge based on the given answers.
