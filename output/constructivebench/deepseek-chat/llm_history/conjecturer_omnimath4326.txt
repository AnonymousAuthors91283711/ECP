theorem omnimath4326 :
  (∃ (n : ℕ) (P : Polynomial ℕ),
    n ≥ 2 ∧
    (∀ i ∈ Finset.range n, ∃ a : ℕ, a > 0 ∧ P.coeff i = a) ∧
    (∀ k : ℕ, k > 0 → Odd (Nat.digits 10 k).sum ↔ Odd (Nat.digits 10 (P.eval k)).sum))
  ↔ omnimath4326_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Prop
<<<True>>> 

Explanation: The existence is satisfied by n=2 and P = X + 1, since:
1. For i=0,1: coeffs are 1 (positive)
2. For any k>0: digits sum parity of k and k+1 are opposite, preserving the odd condition via negation.
