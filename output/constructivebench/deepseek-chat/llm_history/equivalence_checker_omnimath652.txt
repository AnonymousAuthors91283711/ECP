theorem omnimath652 (x y : ℕ) : 
  3^x * 4^y = 2^(x + y) + 2^(2*(x + y) - 1) ↔ (x, y) ∈ omnimath652_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(0, 1), (1, 1)} ∪ {p : ℕ × ℕ | p.2 = 0}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation is 3^x * 4^y = 2^(x+y) + 2^(2*(x+y)-1)
2. Ground truth gives three solutions: (0,1), (1,1), (2,2)
3. Proposed answer gives (0,1), (1,1) plus all pairs where y=0

Testing the proposed answer:
- (0,1): Valid (3^0*4^1=4, RHS=2^1+2^1=4)
- (1,1): Valid (3*4=12, RHS=2^2+2^3=4+8=12)
- (2,2): Not in proposed answer but should be (3^2*4^2=9*16=144, RHS=2^4+2^7=16+128=144)
- Any (x,0): 3^x*1 = 2^x + 2^(2x-1). For x=0: 1=1+1/2 (false). For x=1: 3=2+2 (false). Doesn't work.

The proposed answer:
1. Correctly includes (0,1) and (1,1)
2. Incorrectly excludes (2,2)
3. Incorrectly includes all pairs with y=0 (none of which work)
