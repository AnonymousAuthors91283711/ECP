<<<10 * (2^7 - 6)>>> 

Explanation: The problem counts subsets of size ≥3 from a 10-element cycle where at least one set of 3 consecutive elements exists. For each starting position (10 choices), there are 2^7 ways to choose remaining elements minus invalid cases (6 per position). The pattern generalizes to 10*(2^(10-3) - (3+2+1)).
