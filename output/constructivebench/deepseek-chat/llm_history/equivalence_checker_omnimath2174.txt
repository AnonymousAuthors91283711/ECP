theorem omnimath2174 (n : ℕ) (hn : n ≠ 0) :

Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 1 / n
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n = 1 then 1 else 1 / n
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but differs in the special case when n=1. The ground truth answer gives 1/1 = 1 for n=1, which matches the proposed answer's "if n=1 then 1" branch. However, the proposed answer unnecessarily separates this case when it could just use the general case (1/n) for all n ≠ 0, since 1/1 = 1 anyway. The answers are functionally equivalent but the proposed answer is less elegant.
