Ground Truth Answer: 72576000
Proposed Answer: 10! / 6
<<<True>>>

The proposed answer \(10! / 6\) is equivalent to the ground truth answer 72576000. Here's why:

1. \(10! = 3628800\)
2. \(10! / 6 = 3628800 / 6 = 604800\)
3. However, the ground truth answer is 72576000, which is exactly \(10! × 20\) (since \(3628800 × 20 = 72576000\))

Wait, I made a miscalculation in my initial assessment. The proposed answer \(10! / 6\) gives 604800, which does not equal the ground truth 72576000. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
