From the problem statement and the arithmetic sequence condition on logarithms with base 12, we can deduce that the arguments should form a geometric sequence. The given endpoints are 162 and 1250, and we need to find x as the second term. The pattern suggests x is the geometric mean between 162 and 1250.

The error occurs because `Real.sqrt` is a noncomputable operation in Lean, so we need to mark the definition as `noncomputable`. The proposed answer `Real.sqrt (162 * 1250)` is indeed correct based on the pattern of the problem and the arithmetic sequence condition in logarithms. Here's the fixed version:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2013AMCA_14_answer : ℝ := Real.sqrt (162 * 1250)>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem involves an arithmetic sequence of logarithms with base 12.
2. For a sequence `[a, b, c, d, e]` to be arithmetic, we must have `b - a = c - b = d - c = e - d`.
3. This implies the terms form a geometric sequence when exponentiated: `x^2 = 162 * y` and `y^2 = x * z` etc.
4. The middle term `x` must be the geometric mean of the first and last terms (162 and 1250), hence `x = sqrt(162 * 1250)`.
5. The noncomputable marker is needed because real number operations in Lean often require this for theoretical consistency.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to find a real number x that makes the logarithmic sequence arithmetic. The proposed answer `Real.sqrt (162 * 1250)` is conceptually correct but needs to be marked as noncomputable since it uses Real.sqrt.

The arithmetic sequence condition implies that the logarithms form a linear progression. For the sequence [a, b, c, d, e] to be arithmetic, we must have b - a = c - b = d - c = e - d. 

The geometric mean property suggests that x should be the geometric mean of the first and last terms (162 and 1250) in the sequence, which is why sqrt(162*1250) makes sense. However, we can simplify this expression further.

Here's the fixed answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2013AMCA_14_answer : ℝ := 450>>>

Explanation:
1. The error is fixed by marking it as noncomputable
2. sqrt(162*1250) = sqrt(202500) = 450
3. This maintains the arithmetic progression property in the logarithmic sequence
4. The simplified form 450 is easier to work with and matches the geometric mean calculation

The answer 450 comes from:
162 × 1250 = 202500
√202500 = 450
This creates a perfect geometric progression when paired with the logarithms.
