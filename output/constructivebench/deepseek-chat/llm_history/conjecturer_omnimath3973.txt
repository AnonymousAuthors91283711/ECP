<<<1998 * 2^2>>>

Explanation: The pattern suggests the answer is 1998 multiplied by 2 squared. The enumerated solutions show this relationship holds consistently for similar problems, where the answer is the input number (1998) multiplied by the square of a small integer (2 in this case). This matches the functional equation's structure.
