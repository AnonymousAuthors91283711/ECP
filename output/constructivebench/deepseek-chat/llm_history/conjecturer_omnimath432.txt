Looking at the problem, we need to find the minimal sum x + y where x and y are natural numbers satisfying x * b = y * a. This is essentially finding the smallest solution to the equation x/y = a/b in reduced form.

The proposed answer divides both a and b by their gcd to get the minimal solution, which makes sense because:
1. Dividing by gcd reduces the fraction to simplest form
2. The minimal solution occurs when x and y are coprime
3. The sum x + y will be minimized when x = b/gcd(a,b) and y = a/gcd(a,b)

The error occurs because Lean needs disambiguation between different gcd implementations. We should use Nat.gcd specifically.

Here's the fixed answer:

<<<fun (a, b) => (b / Nat.gcd a b, a / Nat.gcd a b)>>>

Explanation:
- We use Nat.gcd instead of just gcd to resolve ambiguity
- The pair (b/d, a/d) where d = gcd(a,b) gives the minimal solution
- This represents the reduced form of the ratio a/b
- The sum x + y = (a + b)/gcd(a,b) is minimized when using these values[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the error message and problem statement, I notice:
1. The function needs to return a single ℕ (as indicated by the type ℕ × ℕ → ℕ)
2. The problem is about finding minimal x+y where x*b = y*a
3. The proposed answer returns a pair (x,y) instead of their sum
4. The enumerated answers suggest we need the sum of the reduced pair

The minimal solution comes from reducing a and b by their gcd, giving x = b/gcd and y = a/gcd, then summing them. The fix is to add these components together.

<<<fun (a, b) => (b / Nat.gcd a b) + (a / Nat.gcd a b)>>>

Explanation:
- The problem seeks minimal x+y where x*b = y*a
- The equation x*b = y*a implies x/y = a/b
- The minimal solution occurs when x and y are reduced by gcd(a,b)
- Thus x = b/gcd(a,b) and y = a/gcd(a,b)
- The answer is their sum, which gives (a+b)/gcd(a,b)
