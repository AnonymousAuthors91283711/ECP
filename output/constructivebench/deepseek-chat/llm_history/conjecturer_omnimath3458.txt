    (p : Fin 4 → ℝ)
    (hpdiff : ∀ i j, i ≠ j → p i ≠ p j)

    (p 3) / (p 3 + p 2 + p 1 + p 0) = omnimath3458_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
From the problem statement and enumerated answers, we can observe that:
1. The sequence p follows a geometric progression where each term is double the previous (p(i+1) = 2*p(i))
2. The denominator is the sum of all 4 terms
3. The numerator is the last term p3

Given p0 = x, then p1 = 2x, p2 = 4x, p3 = 8x
The expression becomes (8x)/(x + 2x + 4x + 8x) = 8x/15x = 8/15

<<<8/15>>>
