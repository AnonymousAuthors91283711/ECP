Ground Truth Answer: 120
Proposed Answer: 360
Let's analyze this problem carefully:

1. The problem asks for the greatest integer k that divides m⁵ - 5m³ + 4m for all m ≥ 5.

2. First, let's factor the polynomial:
   m⁵ - 5m³ + 4m = m(m⁴ - 5m² + 4) = m(m² - 1)(m² - 4) = (m-2)(m-1)m(m+1)(m+2)

3. This is a product of 5 consecutive integers, which means it's divisible by:
   - 5! = 120 (since it contains 5 consecutive numbers)
   - And also by 8 (since it contains two even numbers, one of which is divisible by 4)

4. Therefore, the minimal such number is 120 (5! = 120), and indeed 120 divides all such expressions.

5. The proposed answer is 360, which is a multiple of 120 (360 = 3×120). While 360 does divide the expression (since it's a multiple of 120), it's not the greatest common divisor - 120 is larger than any smaller number that works, and is itself a solution.

The ground truth answer (120) is correct, while the proposed answer (360) is incorrect because while it satisfies the divisibility condition, it's not the greatest such integer.
