abbrev omnimath3260_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3260 (x : ℝ) : (512 : ℝ)^x = (64 : ℝ)^240 ↔ x = omnimath3260_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 160
Proposed Answer: 80
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

The equation given is: (512)^x = (64)^240

We can rewrite both sides using powers of 2:
512 = 2^9
64 = 2^6

So the equation becomes:
(2^9)^x = (2^6)^240
Which simplifies to:
2^(9x) = 2^(6*240)

Since the bases are equal, we can set the exponents equal:
9x = 6*240
x = (6*240)/9
x = 1440/9
x = 160

The ground truth answer is 160, which matches our calculation.
The proposed answer is 80, which is incorrect as it's exactly half of the correct answer.
