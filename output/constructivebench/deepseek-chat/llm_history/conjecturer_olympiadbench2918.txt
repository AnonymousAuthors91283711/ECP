From the given conditions and enumerated answers, we can observe that:
1. The arithmetic sequence `a` has common difference `d`
2. The geometric sequence `b` has common ratio `r`
3. The combined sequence `c` satisfies specific values at n=1 to 4
4. The pattern suggests `a n = 3n - 2` and `b n = (-2)^n`

The answer for `c 5` would be `a 5 + b 5 = 13 + (-32) = -19`

<<< -19 >>>
