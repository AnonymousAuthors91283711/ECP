Ground Truth Answer: {f : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ → ℝ | ∀ x y z : ℕ, (x + y + z ≠ 0 → f x y z = 3 * x * y * z / (x + y + z))}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∀ p q r, f p q r = if p = 0 ∨ q = 0 ∨ r = 0 then 0 else 3 * p * q * r / (p + q + r)}
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The proposed answer correctly captures the ground truth answer. Both define the function f to be 0 when any of p, q, or r is 0 (which is equivalent to p*q*r=0), and otherwise define it as 3*p*q*r/(p+q+r). The condition x+y+z≠0 in the ground truth is redundant since p,q,r∈ℕ and at least one being non-zero guarantees x+y+z≠0. The recursive definition in the theorem statement is satisfied by this closed-form solution.
