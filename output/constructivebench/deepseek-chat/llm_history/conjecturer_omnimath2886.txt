From the problem, we're looking for positive integer solutions (x,y) to the system:
1. 9x + 4y = 600
2. kx - 4y = 24
3. x > 0, y > 0

Solving the system, we find k must divide 624 and x must be positive. The divisors of 624 greater than 0 are the possible k values. The enumerated answer suggests counting these divisors.
