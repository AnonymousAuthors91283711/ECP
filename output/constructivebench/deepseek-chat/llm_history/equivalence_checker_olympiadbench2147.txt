Ground Truth Answer: {fun x : ℝ => x - 1}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℝ, f = fun x => if x = -1 then -1 else c * (x + 1) - 1}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all real-valued functions f that satisfy:
   - Functional equation: f(1 + xy) - f(x + y) = f(x)f(y) for all x,y ∈ ℝ
   - Constraint: f(-1) ≠ 0

2. Ground Truth Answer: The only solution is the linear function f(x) = x - 1

3. Proposed Answer: Claims solutions are piecewise functions of the form:
   f(x) = if x = -1 then -1 else c*(x+1) - 1

Analysis:
- The ground truth f(x) = x - 1 is indeed a solution (can be verified by substitution)
- The proposed answer includes f(x) = x - 1 when c = 1 (for x ≠ -1)
- However, the proposed answer allows other values of c, which would not satisfy the original functional equation
- The piecewise definition is also problematic since the functional equation must hold for all x,y, including when x+y = -1 or 1+xy = -1

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It allows multiple solutions when only one exists
2. The piecewise definition breaks the functional equation's validity
