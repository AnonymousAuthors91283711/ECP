Looking at the problem, we're dealing with a geometric probability scenario where darts are thrown at a circular target. The key parameters are:
- Total radius: 20
- Target radius: 10
- Initial darts: 2020

The probability p of hitting the target is the ratio of areas (target/total) = (10²)/(20²) = 1/4.

The expected number of throws to get all initial darts (2020) into the target follows a negative binomial distribution pattern. For each dart, the expected throws is 1/p = 4, but since we already have the initial throws, we subtract 1 (the initial throw) and multiply by 2020.

The calculation is: 2020 * (1/(1/4) - 1) = 2020 * (4 - 1) = 2020 * 3 = 6060.

The error in the original code appears to be a missing line break between the p definition and expected_throws definition. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<6060>>>

Explanation: The answer follows from geometric probability principles where we calculate the expected additional throws needed after the initial throws to get all darts in the target area. The probability calculation is correct (1/4) and the expectation formula properly accounts for the initial throws.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
