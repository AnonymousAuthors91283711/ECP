Ground Truth Answer: 168089
Proposed Answer: ∑ k in Finset.Icc 2 100, 1000000 / (k ^ 3)
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is close but not exactly equivalent to the ground truth. The proposed answer calculates the sum of floor(1000000/k³) for k from 2 to 100, which counts all numbers ≤1,000,000 divisible by k³ for some k>1. However, this double-counts numbers divisible by multiple cubes (e.g., numbers divisible by both 2³ and 3³). The ground truth answer of 168,089 is the correct count after accounting for these overlaps (likely using inclusion-exclusion principle). The proposed answer would give a slightly higher count due to the double-counting issue.
