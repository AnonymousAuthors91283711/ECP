Ground Truth Answer: 7 + (13 * π) / 3
Proposed Answer: (4 * Real.pi) / 3 + 3 * Real.pi / 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating the average number of integer-coordinate cubes (p,q,r) where the unit sphere centered at (x,y,z) intersects the cube (p,p+1)×(q,q+1)×(r,r+1), averaged over all (x,y,z) in the unit cube [0,1]³.

2. The ground truth answer is 7 + (13π)/3
3. The proposed answer is (4π)/3 + 3π/4 = (25π)/12 ≈ 6.545

The proposed answer is significantly different from the ground truth answer:
- Numerically, 7 + (13π)/3 ≈ 7 + 13.614 = 20.614
- While (25π)/12 ≈ 6.545

The proposed answer is missing the constant term 7 and has incorrect coefficients for the π terms.
