Ground Truth Answer: {fun x : ℝ => 2}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c ≠ 0, f = fun x => c ^ (x ^ 2)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all functions f: ℝ → ℝ that satisfy:
   - f(0) ≠ 0
   - f(f x) + f(f y) = f(x + y) * f(x * y) for all x,y ∈ ℝ

2. Ground truth answer is the constant function f(x) = 2

3. Proposed answer suggests all functions of form f(x) = c^(x²) where c ≠ 0

Testing the ground truth:
f(x) = 2 satisfies:
- f(0) = 2 ≠ 0
- f(f x) + f(f y) = 2 + 2 = 4
- f(x+y)*f(xy) = 2*2 = 4
So it satisfies the equation.

Testing the proposed answer:
Take f(x) = c^(x²)
f(f x) + f(f y) = c^(c^(2x²)) + c^(c^(2y²))
f(x+y)*f(xy) = c^((x+y)²) * c^((xy)²) = c^((x+y)² + (xy)²)
These are not equal in general. For example, take c=2, x=1, y=1:
Left side: 2^(2^(2)) + 2^(2^(2)) = 8 + 8 = 16
Right side: 2^(4 + 1) = 32
These are not equal.

The only case where the proposed form works is when c=1 (f(x)=1), but this fails f(0)≠0 condition. The constant function f(x)=2 is indeed a solution, but the proposed answer includes incorrect solutions.
