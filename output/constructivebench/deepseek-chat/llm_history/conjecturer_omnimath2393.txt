Looking at the problem, we need to find the greatest difference between infima of two quadratic functions constructed from distinct triples (a,b,c) where a,b,c ∈ {1,...,11}. The proposed answer -(11*10)/2 suggests looking at the maximum possible difference.

Key observations:
1. The infimum of f(x) = a(x-b)(x-c) occurs at x = (b+c)/2 (vertex of parabola)
2. The infimum of g(x) = a(x-b)(x+c) occurs at x = (b-c)/2
3. The difference is a[(b-c)²/4 - (b+c)²/4] = -abc

To maximize this difference, we should:
- Maximize a (so a=11)
- Maximize b*c (so b=10, c=11 or b=11, c=10)
- The expression becomes -11*10*11/4 + 11*10*11/4 = -110/2 = -55

The correct answer should be -55, which matches the pattern in the error message but needs proper real number division syntax in Lean. Here's the fixed version:

<<<(-11 * 10 * 11) / 4 + (11 * 10 * 11) / 4>>> 

However, simplifying this we get -55, so the most compact form would be:

<<<(-55 : ℝ)>>>

But since the original problem shows division by 2, and 110/2=55, the correct negative form is:

<<<(-55 : ℝ)>>>

The error was due to missing type annotation and incorrect calculation. The maximum difference occurs when a=11, b=10, c=11 (or permutations), giving -abc = -55.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem, we need to find the maximum difference between the infima of two quadratic functions f and g defined using distinct integers a,b,c from 1 to 11. The current proposed answer evaluates to 0, which doesn't make sense for a maximum difference.

From the structure:
1. f(x) = a(x-b)(x-c) is a quadratic opening upwards (since a > 0)
2. g(x) = a(x-b)(x+c) is also quadratic but with different roots
3. The infimum of f will be at its vertex x = (b+c)/2
4. The infimum of g will be at its vertex x = (b-c)/2

Calculating the difference between infima:
sInf f - sInf g = f((b+c)/2) - g((b-c)/2) = -a(b-c)²/4 - (-a(b+c)²/4) = a(b²+2bc+c²-b²+2bc-c²)/4 = a(4bc)/4 = abc

Thus the maximum difference occurs when a, b, c are largest distinct numbers in 1..11, giving 11*10*9 = 990.

<<<990>>>
