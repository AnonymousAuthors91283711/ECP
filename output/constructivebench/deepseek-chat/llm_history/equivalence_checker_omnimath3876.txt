theorem omnimath3876 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ m n : ℕ, f (f n + f m) = m + n) ↔ f = omnimath3876_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if Even n then n / 2 else (n + 1) / 2 + 1
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is asking to find a function f: ℕ → ℕ that satisfies the functional equation:
∀ m n : ℕ, f (f n + f m) = m + n

The ground truth answer is the identity function f(n) = n.

The proposed answer is a piecewise function that:
- Divides even numbers by 2
- For odd numbers, adds 1, divides by 2, then adds 1

Let's test the proposed function:
1. For f(n) = n/2 when n is even:
   f(f(2) + f(2)) = f(1 + 1) = f(2) = 1
   But 2 + 2 = 4 ≠ 1, so it fails.

2. For the odd case, take n=1, m=1:
   f(1) = (1+1)/2 + 1 = 2
   f(f(1) + f(1)) = f(2 + 2) = f(4) = 2
   But 1 + 1 = 2, which matches here, but the even case fails.

The proposed function only satisfies the equation in some cases but not all, while the identity function satisfies it universally. They are not equivalent.
