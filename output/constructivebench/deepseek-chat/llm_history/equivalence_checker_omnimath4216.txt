theorem omnimath4216 :
  {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∀ d ∈ (digits 10 (n ^ 2)), Odd d} = omnimath4216_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {1, 3}
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, n = 10 ^ k ∨ n = 2 * 10 ^ k ∨ n = 8 * 10 ^ k}
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem asks for natural numbers n > 0 where all digits of n² are odd.

2. Ground truth {1,3}:
- 1² = 1 (digit: 1, odd)
- 3² = 9 (digit: 9, odd)
These clearly satisfy the condition.

3. Proposed answer suggests numbers of form 10^k, 2*10^k, or 8*10^k:
- For k=0: 1,2,8
  - 1²=1 (valid)
  - 2²=4 (digit 4 is even - invalid)
  - 8²=64 (digits 6,4 both even - invalid)
- For k>0: All squares will have even digits (since they'll end with at least two zeros and have other digits)

The proposed answer includes invalid numbers (2,8 and their multiples by powers of 10) and misses valid numbers (3).
