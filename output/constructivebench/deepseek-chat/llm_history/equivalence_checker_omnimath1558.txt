Ground Truth Answer: 37/4
Proposed Answer: 5 / 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes two sequences:
   - An arithmetic sequence aₙ = a₁ + (n-1)*d
   - A geometric sequence bₙ = b₁ * r^(n-1)

2. We're given constraints:
   - a₁*b₁ = 20
   - (a₁ + d)*(b₁*r) = 19
   - (a₁ + 2d)*(b₁*r²) = 14
   - We need to find the maximum possible value of (a₁ + 3d)*(b₁*r³)

3. The ground truth answer is 37/4 (which is 9.25)
4. The proposed answer is 5/2 (which is 2.5)

The proposed answer is significantly smaller than the ground truth answer. The problem asks for the greatest possible value of x in the described set, and 37/4 is indeed greater than 5/2. 

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
