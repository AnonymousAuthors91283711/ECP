theorem P2004AMCB_12 (n : ℕ) (hn : n ≥ 3) :
  let rec f : ℕ → ℕ
    | 0 => 2001
    | 1 => 2002

Looking at the recurrence relation and initial conditions, this appears to be a linear recurrence. The pattern suggests a solution that alternates between two values. From the enumerated answers, we can see the pattern repeats every 3 steps. Here's the generalized solution:

<<<fun n : ℕ => if n % 3 = 1 then 2002 else if n % 3 = 2 then 2003 else 2001>>>
