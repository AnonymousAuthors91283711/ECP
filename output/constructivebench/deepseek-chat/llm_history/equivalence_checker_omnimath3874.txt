abbrev omnimath3874_answer : Set (ℤ × ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3874 :
  {(a, b) : ℤ × ℤ | (b^2 + 7 * (a - b))^2 = a^3 * b} = omnimath3874_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(n, n) | n : ℤ} ∪ {(0, 7), (12, 3), (-18, -2)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b) | b = 0 ∨ a = b ∨ (a, b) = (0, 7) ∨ (a, b) = (7, 0)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all integer pairs (a,b) that satisfy (b² + 7(a - b))² = a³b.

2. Ground Truth Answer correctly identifies all solutions:
   - All pairs where a = b (since when a=b, equation becomes (a²)² = a⁴ which holds for all a)
   - Plus three exceptional cases: (0,7), (12,3), (-18,-2)

3. Proposed Answer claims:
   - All pairs where b=0
   - All pairs where a=b
   - Plus (0,7) and (7,0)

Comparison:
- The proposed answer incorrectly includes b=0 cases (these don't satisfy the equation unless a=0)
- It misses (12,3) and (-18,-2)
- It incorrectly includes (7,0) which doesn't satisfy the equation
- The a=b part is correct
