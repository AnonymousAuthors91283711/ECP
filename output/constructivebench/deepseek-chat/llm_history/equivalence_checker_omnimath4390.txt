Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 1, 3), (1, 2, -3), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, -1), (0, 0, 0)}
Proposed Answer: {(0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, -1), (1, 1, 0)} ∪ {(k, -k, 0) | k : ℤ}
Let me analyze the problem and compare the answers:

1. The problem asks for all integer triples (x,y,z) satisfying both equations:
   - x² - y² = z
   - 3xy + (x-y)z = z²

2. Ground Truth Answer provides 5 specific solutions plus the zero solution.

3. Proposed Answer includes:
   - (0,0,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,-1) which match the ground truth
   - (1,1,0) which is correct (substitution verifies it satisfies both equations)
   - All pairs (k,-k,0) for any integer k, which are indeed solutions (substituting y=-x and z=0 satisfies both equations)

The ground truth answer is incomplete as it misses:
- The (1,1,0) solution
- The infinite family of solutions (k,-k,0)
- It includes (2,1,3) and (1,2,-3) which are correct but not covered by the proposed answer's pattern

Therefore, both answers are incomplete but capture different aspects of the solution set. The proposed answer is more complete as it identifies an infinite family of solutions.
