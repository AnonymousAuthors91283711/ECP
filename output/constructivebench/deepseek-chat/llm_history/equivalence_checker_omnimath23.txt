abbrev omnimath23_answer : Set (ℤ × ℤ → ℝ) := sorry
theorem omnimath23 (f : ℤ × ℤ → ℝ) :
  (∀ (x y : ℤ), f (x, y) ∈ Set.Icc 0 1 ∧ f (x, y) = (f (x - 1, y) + f (x, y - 1)) / 2) ↔ f ∈ omnimath23_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ (C : ℝ), C ∈ Set.Icc 0 1 ∧ ∀ (x y : ℤ), f (x, y) = C}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ a b : ℝ, ∀ x y : ℤ, f (x, y) = a * x + b * y + (1 - a - b) * x * y}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes functions f: ℤ×ℤ → ℝ that satisfy:
   - f(x,y) is always between 0 and 1
   - f satisfies a recurrence relation: f(x,y) = (f(x-1,y) + f(x,y-1))/2

2. The ground truth answer states that the only solutions are constant functions where f(x,y) = C for some C ∈ [0,1]

3. The proposed answer suggests solutions are bilinear functions of the form a*x + b*y + (1-a-b)*x*y

Analysis:
- The recurrence relation is characteristic of harmonic functions on the integer lattice
- The only bounded harmonic functions on ℤ² are constant functions (this is a known result in discrete potential theory)
- The proposed bilinear functions generally won't satisfy the recurrence relation unless a = b = 0 (making them constant)
- The proposed form includes non-constant solutions that wouldn't satisfy the given conditions

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect as it includes many non-solutions, while the ground truth correctly identifies only the constant solutions.
