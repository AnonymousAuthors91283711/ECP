Ground Truth Answer: 28
Proposed Answer: 44
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer step by step.

1. Total games: 60
2. Games per pair: 60/3 = 20
3. For each pair:
   - Alvin vs Bingyi: 20 games
     - Alvin wins 20% → 4 wins
     - Bingyi wins 80% → 16 wins
   - Bingyi vs Cheska: 20 games
     - Bingyi wins 60% → 12 wins
     - Cheska wins 40% → 8 wins
   - Cheska vs Alvin: 20 games
     - Cheska wins 40% → 8 wins
     - Alvin wins 60% → 12 wins

4. Total Bingyi wins:
   - From Alvin vs Bingyi: 16
   - From Bingyi vs Cheska: 12
   - From Cheska vs Alvin: Cheska wins 8, so Bingyi doesn't win any here
   - Total: 16 + 12 + 0 = 28

The ground truth answer is 28, while the proposed answer is 44. The proposed answer is incorrect as it likely miscalculated the wins from different matchups.

<<<False>>>
