Ground Truth Answer: 4^7
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking which of the given exponential expressions is a perfect square (can be written as n² for some natural number n).

2. Let's evaluate each option:
   - 2³ = 8 → Not a perfect square
   - 3⁵ = 243 → Not a perfect square
   - 4⁷ = (2²)⁷ = 2¹⁴ = (2⁷)² = 128² → Perfect square
   - 5⁹ = 1953125 → Not a perfect square
   - 6¹¹ → Clearly not a perfect square (prime factorization would have odd exponents)

3. The ground truth correctly identifies 4⁷ as the perfect square.

4. The proposed answer is 8, which corresponds to 2³, but we've shown this isn't a perfect square.

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the only true case (4⁷).

<<<False>>>
