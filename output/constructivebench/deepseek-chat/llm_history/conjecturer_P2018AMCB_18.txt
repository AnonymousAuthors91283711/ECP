<<<(fib 2017)>>> 

Explanation: The problem defines a function f that matches the Fibonacci sequence (shifted by 1 index since f(1)=1, f(2)=1). Therefore, f(n) = fib(n) where fib is the standard Fibonacci sequence. The answer for f(2018) would be fib(2017) because f starts counting from 1 while fib typically starts from 0.
