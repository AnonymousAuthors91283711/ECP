abbrev omnimath94_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath94 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ m n : ℕ, f (m + n) * f (m - n) = f (m^2)) ↔ f = omnimath94_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun _ => 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n = 0 then 1 else n^2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a function f : ℕ → ℕ that satisfies the functional equation:
   ∀ m n, f (m + n) * f (m - n) = f (m²)

2. The ground truth answer is the constant function f(n) = 1 for all n ∈ ℕ.

3. The proposed answer is a piecewise function: f(n) = 1 when n=0, otherwise f(n)=n².

Let's test the proposed answer against the functional equation:

Take m=1, n=1:
f(1+1)*f(1-1) = f(2)*f(0) = 2² * 1 = 4
But f(1²) = f(1) = 1² = 1
4 ≠ 1, so the equation fails.

The ground truth answer works because 1*1=1 for any m,n.

The proposed answer fails to satisfy the condition, while the ground truth answer satisfies it perfectly.
