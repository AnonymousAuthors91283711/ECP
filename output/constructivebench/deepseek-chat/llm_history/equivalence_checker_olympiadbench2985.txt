Ground Truth Answer: 60
Proposed Answer: 40
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us specific values for a, b, c (19, 20, 21 respectively) and asks us to evaluate the expression:
   (a² + b² + c² + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca)/(a + b + c)

2. First, let's compute the denominator:
   a + b + c = 19 + 20 + 21 = 60

3. The numerator can be rewritten using the identity:
   a² + b² + c² + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca = (a + b + c)²
   So the expression simplifies to: (a + b + c)²/(a + b + c) = a + b + c

4. Therefore, the expression equals a + b + c = 60

5. The ground truth answer is 60, which matches our calculation.

6. The proposed answer is 40, which does not match our calculation.
