Ground Truth Answer: {a : ℝ | ∃ α β : ℝ, α * β > 0 ∧ a = Real.sqrt (α / β)}
Proposed Answer: {a : ℝ | ∃ α β : ℝ, α * β > 0 ∧ β * a^2 + α = 0}
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. The ground truth answer states that a = √(α/β) under the condition αβ > 0.
2. The proposed answer states that βa² + α = 0 under the same condition.

Let's solve the proposed equation:
βa² + α = 0
=> a² = -α/β
=> a = ±√(-α/β)

But from αβ > 0, we know:
- If both α and β are positive, then -α/β is negative, making a imaginary (but we're in ℝ)
- If both α and β are negative, then -α/β is positive, but √(-α/β) = √(|α|/|β|) = √(α/β) since both are negative

The proposed answer only makes sense when both α and β are negative, where it becomes equivalent to the ground truth answer. However, it fails when both are positive (producing no real solutions when the ground truth would). Therefore, the answers are not fully equivalent.
