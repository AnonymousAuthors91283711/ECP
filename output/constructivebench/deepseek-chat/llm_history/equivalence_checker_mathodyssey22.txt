Ground Truth Answer: 14
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves Euler's totient function (φ) for the product of two primes p and q where p < q.
2. We know that φ(p*q) = (p-1)(q-1) for distinct primes p and q.
3. The equation given is φ(p*q) = 3p + q, which translates to (p-1)(q-1) = 3p + q.
4. Expanding and simplifying: pq - p - q + 1 = 3p + q → pq - 4p - 2q + 1 = 0
5. Adding 8 to both sides: pq - 4p - 2q + 9 = 8 → (p-2)(q-4) = 8
6. The integer solutions to this are pairs (p,q) where p and q are primes with p < q:
   - (3,13): (3-2)(13-4) = 1*9 = 9 ≠ 8
   - (3,5): (3-2)(5-4) = 1*1 = 1 ≠ 8
   - (5,7): (5-2)(7-4) = 3*3 = 9 ≠ 8
   - (3,8): but 8 isn't prime
   - (4,6): neither are primes
   - The correct solution is (3,11): (3-2)(11-4) = 1*7 = 7 ≠ 8 (but close)
   - Actually, the correct solution is (5,13): (5-2)(13-4) = 3*9 = 27 ≠ 8

Wait, none of these work. There seems to be an error in the problem setup or answers. The ground truth answer is 14 (which would correspond to p=3, q=11: 3+11=14), but our calculation shows this doesn't satisfy the equation. The proposed answer 8 would correspond to p=3, q=5 (3+5=8), but this also doesn't satisfy the equation.

Given that neither answer seems to satisfy the equation, but the ground truth answer (14) is closer to being correct (as (3,11) is closer to satisfying the equation than (3,5)), I'll conclude:

<<<False>>>
