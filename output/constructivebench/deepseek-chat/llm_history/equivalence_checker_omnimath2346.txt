Ground Truth Answer: 1024 / 255
Proposed Answer: 7 / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the average size of non-empty subsets of a set with 8 elements.

2. For a set with n elements:
   - Total number of subsets = 2^n
   - Number of non-empty subsets = 2^n - 1
   - Sum of sizes of all subsets = n * 2^(n-1)
   - Sum of sizes of non-empty subsets = n * 2^(n-1)
   - Average size = (n * 2^(n-1)) / (2^n - 1)

3. For n=8:
   - Ground truth gives 1024/255
     - 8 * 2^7 = 1024
     - 2^8 - 1 = 255
     - This matches the formula
   - Proposed answer gives 7/2 = 3.5
     - 1024/255 ≈ 4.0157
     - These are not equal

The proposed answer is incorrect. The ground truth follows from standard combinatorics of subset sizes.
