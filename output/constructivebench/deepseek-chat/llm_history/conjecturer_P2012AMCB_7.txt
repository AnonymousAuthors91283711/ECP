Looking at the problem and the error message, I notice a few key things:

1. The error is about syntax - there needs to be a line break or semicolon between the pattern definition and totalRedLights declaration.

2. The problem involves a traffic light pattern [0,0,1,1,1] where 0 represents red lights. We need to find positions of red lights and calculate the difference between 21st and 3rd red light.

3. The pattern has 2 red lights every 5 lights (positions 0 and 1 mod 5).

4. The proposed answer ((21-1)*6)/12 simplifies to 10, but this seems too simple given the problem's complexity.

Based on the pattern, the nth red light occurs at position:
- For odd n: (5*(n-1)/2)
- For even n: (5*(n-2)/2 + 1)

Calculating for n=21 (odd) and n=3 (odd):
- 21st red: 5*(21-1)/2 = 50
- 3rd red: 5*(3-1)/2 = 5
Difference: 45
Final calculation: (45*6)/12 = 22.5

Here's the corrected answer:

Looking at the problem and the error message, I notice several issues:

1. The error is about syntax - there needs to be a line break between the pattern definition and totalRedLights declaration
2. The proposed answer (45 : ℚ) * 6 / 12 is too specific and doesn't generalize the pattern
3. The problem involves calculating positions of red lights in a repeating pattern [0,0,1,1,1] where 0=red

From the pattern, red lights occur at positions ≡ 0 or 1 mod 5. The third red is at position 5 (positions 0,1,5) and the 21st red would be at position 50 (since every 5 positions gives 2 reds, so 21 reds would take 10 full cycles plus 1 more red).

Calculating (50-5)*6/12 = 45*6/12 = 22.5. This matches the pattern seen in the enumerated answers.

Here's the generalized answer:

<<<(45 : ℚ) / 2>>>

Explanation:
- The difference between 21st and 3rd red positions is 45 (50-5)
- We multiply by 6 and divide by 12, which simplifies to multiplying by 1/2
- Thus the final answer is 45/2 = 22.5
- The answer is in ℚ as required by the problem statement[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem, we need to find the difference between the 21st and 3rd red light positions in a repeating pattern [0,0,1,1,1] (where 0=red, 1=green), then compute (difference * 6)/12.

The pattern repeats every 5 lights with 2 reds. For 21 red lights, we need 21/(2/5) = 52.5 total lights. The 3rd red is at position 7 (pattern positions: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 where reds are at 0,1,5). The 21st red would be at position 52 (since 21 reds cover 52.5 lights, but positions are integers).

Calculating (52-7)*6/12 = 45*6/12 = 45/2. The error in the original code was just syntax (missing line break between pattern and totalRedLights declarations), but the answer itself is correct.

Looking at the problem, we need to find a rational number that satisfies the given condition about traffic light patterns. The pattern repeats every 5 lights (0,0,1,1,1), where 0 represents red and 1 represents green. 

Key observations:
1. The pattern has 2 red lights out of every 5 lights
2. We're asked about the difference between the 21st and 3rd red light positions
3. The final answer is scaled by (6/12) = 1/2

From the enumerated answers, we see 45/2 is proposed. Let's verify this:

- Each full cycle (5 lights) contains 2 red lights
- The 3rd red light would be in the 2nd cycle (positions 5-9), specifically at position 7 (since first cycle has positions 0,1 as red)
- The 21st red light would be in the 11th cycle (since 21 red lights / 2 per cycle = 10.5 cycles), at position 52 (10 full cycles = 50 lights + 2 more red lights at 50,51)
- Difference: 52 - 7 = 45
- Scaled by 1/2: 45/2

The error in the original code appears to be a syntax issue with multiple lets on one line. Here's the corrected answer:
