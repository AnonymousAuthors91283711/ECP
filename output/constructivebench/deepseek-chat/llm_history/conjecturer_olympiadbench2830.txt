Looking at the constraints:
1. x*y = 20
2. y*z = 12
3. x,y,z > 0

From x*y=20 and y*z=12, we can express x and z in terms of y:
x = 20/y
z = 12/y

Since x,z must be positive integers, y must be a common divisor of 20 and 12. The common divisors are 1,2,4.

Now we can enumerate possible y values:
- y=1: x=20, z=12 → sum=32
- y=2: x=10, z=6 → sum=16
- y=4: x=5, z=3 → sum=8

The minimal sum is 8.
