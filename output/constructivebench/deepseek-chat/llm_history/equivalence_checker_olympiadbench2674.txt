Ground Truth Answer: 5
Proposed Answer: 2^5 * 3^4 * 5 * 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number b > 1 where:
   - 11! can be written as k*b² where b doesn't divide k
   - For m < 2 (i.e., m=0,1), 11! cannot be written as k*b^(m+1) with b not dividing k

2. Ground truth answer is 5, which is indeed correct because:
   - 11! = 39916800
   - 39916800 = 1596672 * 5² (and 5 doesn't divide 1596672)
   - For m=0: 39916800 = k*5¹ would require 5|k since 5 divides 11!
   - For m=1: 39916800 = k*5² already has b not dividing k

3. The proposed answer "2^5 * 3^4 * 5 * 7" equals 90720, which:
   - Is much larger than 5
   - Doesn't satisfy the minimality condition
   - While it might satisfy the divisibility conditions, it's not the least such b

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the minimal solution required by the problem.
