From the problem statement, we need to find a closed form expression for x + y given the conditions G = G' where G = x/(1-y) and G' = y/(1-x). The proposed answer was trying to express x + y in terms of x and y, but the error shows we need a constant value since omnimath803_answer is defined without parameters.

Looking at the equation G = G':
x/(1-y) = y/(1-x)
Cross-multiplying:
x(1-x) = y(1-y)
x - x² = y - y²
Rearranging:
x - y = x² - y²
x - y = (x - y)(x + y)
For x ≠ y (implied by x < y in hxy), we can divide both sides by (x - y):
1 = x + y

Thus, the constant answer should be 1. The enumerated answers likely show this pattern consistently.
