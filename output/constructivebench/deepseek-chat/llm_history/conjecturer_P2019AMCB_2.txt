From the problem statement and enumerated answers, we're looking for a composite number n where both n and n-2 are not prime. The smallest such number is 9 (9 is composite, 7 is prime, but 25 also fits - 25 is composite and 23 is prime). However, the enumerated answers suggest 25 is the intended solution.
