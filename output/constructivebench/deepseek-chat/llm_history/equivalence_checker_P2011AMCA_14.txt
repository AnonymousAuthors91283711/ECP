theorem P2011AMCA_14 :
  let pairs := Finset.product (Finset.Icc 1 9) (Finset.Icc 1 9)
  let count := pairs.filter (fun (a, b) => b > a * a - b * 1)

Ground Truth Answer: 19/81
Proposed Answer: ((9 * 9 - (4 * 4 + 5)) : ℚ) / (9 * 9 : ℚ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting pairs (a,b) where 1 ≤ a,b ≤ 9 and b > a² - b (which simplifies to 2b > a²)
2. Total possible pairs is 9×9 = 81
3. The ground truth answer is 19/81
4. The proposed answer calculates (81 - (16 + 5))/81 = (81 - 21)/81 = 60/81 = 20/27 ≠ 19/81

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It subtracts 4×4 (16) for a=1,2,3,4 cases, but the counting is wrong
- It subtracts an additional 5 for some reason
- The correct count should be 19 pairs satisfying the condition, not 60
