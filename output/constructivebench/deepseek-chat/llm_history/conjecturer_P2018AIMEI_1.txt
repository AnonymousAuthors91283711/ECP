  let S := { (a, b) : ℕ × ℕ | 1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 100 ∧ 0 ≤ b ∧
    ∃ (c d : ℤ), x^2 + a * x + b = (x + c) * (x + d) }

From the problem statement and the pattern of enumerating solutions for quadratic factorizations, the key is counting pairs (a,b) where x² + a*x + b factors over integers. For 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, b must satisfy b = c*d and a = c+d for integers c,d. The number of valid pairs is 100*101/2 = 5050.
