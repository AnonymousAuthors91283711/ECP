Ground Truth Answer: 95
Proposed Answer: 73
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n > 0 such that for all k in the range 0 to 72 (Finset.range 73), the fraction (k+19)/(n+k+21) is irreducible.

2. For a fraction to be irreducible, the numerator and denominator must be coprime (gcd = 1).

3. The ground truth answer is 95. Let's verify why:
   - For n=95, denominator becomes (k + 95 + 21) = k + 116
   - We need gcd(k+19, k+116) = gcd(k+19, 97) = 1 for all k from 0 to 72
   - Since 97 is prime, this holds unless k+19 ≡ 0 mod 97
   - But k+19 ≤ 72+19 = 91 < 97, so no such k exists

4. The proposed answer is 73:
   - For n=73, denominator becomes k + 94
   - We need gcd(k+19, k+94) = gcd(k+19, 75) = 1 for all k from 0 to 72
   - But when k=56: k+19=75, gcd(75,75)=75≠1 → fraction is reducible
   - Therefore n=73 doesn't satisfy the condition
