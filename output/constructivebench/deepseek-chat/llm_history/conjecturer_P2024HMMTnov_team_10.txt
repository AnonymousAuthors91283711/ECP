Looking at the problem and error message, we need to find a closed form expression for the sum from n=16 to 300 of some function f(n). The error suggests 'f' is undefined, but the proposed answer shows a pattern of triangular numbers (n(n+1)/2).

The proposed answer calculates the sum from 1 to 300 minus the sum from 1 to 15, which is indeed the sum from 16 to 300. This matches the triangular number pattern seen in the enumerated answers.

Here's the corrected Lean expression:

<<<(300 * 301 / 2) - (15 * 16 / 2)>>>

Explanation:
1. The sum from 16 to 300 can be expressed as (sum 1 to 300) minus (sum 1 to 15)
2. The triangular number formula T(n) = n(n+1)/2 gives us these partial sums
3. The expression calculates T(300) - T(15)
4. This matches the pattern seen in the enumerated answers where sums are computed using triangular numbers

The error was likely due to missing parentheses in the original proposal and undefined function f. The corrected version uses standard triangular number arithmetic.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem and error message, I notice:
1. The error indicates `f` is undefined in the theorem statement
2. The proposed answer suggests a triangular number difference (sum of first n numbers)
3. The range is from 16 to 300, which matches the triangular number pattern

The most likely interpretation is that `f n = n`, making this a simple sum of consecutive integers from 16 to 300. The triangular number formula for sum from a to b is T(b) - T(a-1), where T(n) = n(n+1)/2.

The correct Lean expression should be the difference of triangular numbers for 300 and 15 (since 16-1=15):

<<<(300 * 301) / 2 - (15 * 16) / 2>>>

Explanation:
- The sum from 16 to 300 can be computed as (sum 1 to 300) minus (sum 1 to 15)
- Each partial sum is a triangular number n(n+1)/2
- The expression calculates T(300) - T(15)
- This matches the pattern seen in the proposed answer but fixes the undefined `f` issue by making the sum explicit[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem and error message, I notice:
1. The error indicates `f` is undefined in the theorem statement
2. The proposed answer suggests a sum of consecutive integers from 16 to 300
3. The formula (n*(n+1)/2 - m*(m+1)/2) is standard for sum from m+1 to n

The correct answer should be the sum of integers from 16 to 300, which can be expressed as the difference of two triangular numbers. The proposed answer was almost correct but needed to be adjusted for exact bounds and converted to Lean's Nat division.

Here's the fixed answer:

<<<(300 * 301) / 2 - (15 * 16) / 2>>>

Explanation:
- The sum from 16 to 300 equals (sum 1 to 300) minus (sum 1 to 15)
- Each partial sum is computed using the triangular number formula n(n+1)/2
- The bounds are adjusted because sum from a to b = sum 1 to b - sum 1 to (a-1)
- The answer maintains exact integer division since both terms are even[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
