Ground Truth Answer: 7 / 5
Proposed Answer: 5 / 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recurrence relation: aₙ₊₁ = 1 + 1/(1 + aₙ) for n ∈ {0,1,2}
2. We're given that a₂ = 41/29
3. We need to find a₀

Let's verify the proposed answer (5/3):

1. Calculate a₁ using a₀ = 5/3:
   a₁ = 1 + 1/(1 + 5/3) = 1 + 1/(8/3) = 1 + 3/8 = 11/8

2. Calculate a₂ using a₁ = 11/8:
   a₂ = 1 + 1/(1 + 11/8) = 1 + 1/(19/8) = 1 + 8/19 = 27/19 ≈ 1.421

But the given a₂ is 41/29 ≈ 1.413, which doesn't match 27/19.

Now verify the ground truth answer (7/5):

1. Calculate a₁ using a₀ = 7/5:
   a₁ = 1 + 1/(1 + 7/5) = 1 + 1/(12/5) = 1 + 5/12 = 17/12

2. Calculate a₂ using a₁ = 17/12:
   a₂ = 1 + 1/(1 + 17/12) = 1 + 1/(29/12) = 1 + 12/29 = 41/29

This matches exactly with the given condition.
