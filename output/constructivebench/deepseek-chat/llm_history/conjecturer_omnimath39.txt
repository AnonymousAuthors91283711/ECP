theorem omnimath39 :
  {a : ℕ | a > 0 ∧ ∃ X : Finset ℤ, X.card = 6 ∧ ∀ k ∈ Icc 1 36, ∃ x ∈ X, ∃ y ∈ X, 37 ∣ a * x + y - k} = omnimath39_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{37}>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks for positive integers 'a' where for any k from 1 to 36, there exists x,y in a 6-element set of integers such that 37 divides a*x + y - k. The enumerated answer shows only 37 works, likely because 37 is prime and allows sufficient combinations via its multiplicative properties.
