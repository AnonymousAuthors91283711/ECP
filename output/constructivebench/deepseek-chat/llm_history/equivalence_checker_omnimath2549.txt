Ground Truth Answer: fun k n => if k > 1 ∧ n > 1 then k * n else k + n
Proposed Answer: fun k n => k + n - 1
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer:

1. For k > 1 ∧ n > 1:
   - Ground truth: k * n
   - Proposed: k + n - 1
   These are clearly different (e.g., for k=2, n=2: 4 vs 3)

2. For k=1 or n=1:
   - Ground truth: k + n
   - Proposed: k + n - 1
   These differ by 1 (e.g., k=1, n=5: 6 vs 5)

3. For k=1 and n=1:
   - Ground truth: 2
   - Proposed: 1

The answers differ in all cases, though they are somewhat close when k or n is 1 (differing by 1). The proposed answer is incorrect for the general case.
