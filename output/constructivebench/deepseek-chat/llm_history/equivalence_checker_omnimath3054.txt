Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a unique digit difference d (0 ≤ d ≤ 9) between two digits a and b (where a is 1-9 and b is 0-9) such that when you form two-digit numbers (10a+b and 10b+a), their difference is 54.

2. The equation we need to solve is:
   (10b + a) - (10a + b) = 54
   Simplifying: 9b - 9a = 54 → b - a = 6

3. Therefore, the digit difference must be |a - b| = 6 (since b - a = 6).

4. The ground truth answer correctly identifies this difference as 6.

5. The proposed answer suggests 5, which doesn't satisfy the equation since we've mathematically proven the difference must be 6.
