From the problem constraints and enumerated answers, we can deduce that the floor values must be small integers. The pattern suggests:
- floor a = 1, floor b = 2, floor c = 1
- Then solving the equations gives a ∈ (1,2), b = 2, c = 5/2

The error occurs because the set comprehension syntax in Lean needs explicit type annotations and proper variable binding. The proposed answer is close but needs proper syntax for defining a set of triples in ℝ × ℝ × ℝ.

Looking at the problem constraints:
1. floor(a)*b*c = 3
2. a*floor(b)*c = 4
3. a*b*floor(c) = 5

From the enumerated answers and pattern matching, we can deduce:
- floor(a) must be 1 (since a ∈ (1,2))
- floor(b) must be 2
- floor(c) must be 2 (since 5/2 = 2.5)

Thus the solution should be all triples where:
- a ∈ (1,2)
- b = 2 (exactly)
- c = 5/2 (exactly)

Here's the corrected Lean syntax:

<<<{ (a, b, c) : ℝ × ℝ × ℝ | a ∈ Set.Ioo (1 : ℝ) 2 ∧ b = (2 : ℝ) ∧ c = (5 : ℝ)/2 }>>>

The fixes include:
1. Using proper tuple syntax (a,b,c) instead of pattern matching ⟨a,b,c⟩
2. Adding explicit type annotations for all numeric literals
3. Using proper set membership syntax with type ℝ
4. Using division with proper type annotations

This matches the mathematical solution where we have:
- a ∈ (1,2) ⇒ floor(a) = 1 ⇒ 1*b*c=3 ⇒ b*c=3
- floor(b)=2 ⇒ a*2*c=4 ⇒ a*c=2
- floor(c)=2 ⇒ a*b*2=5 ⇒ a*b=2.5
Solving these gives b=2 and c=2.5 exactly, with a ∈ (1,2) arbitrary.
