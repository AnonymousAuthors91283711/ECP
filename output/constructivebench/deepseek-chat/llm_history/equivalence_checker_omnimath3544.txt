Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | ∀ d ∈ digits 10 n, d ≠ 0}
Proposed Answer: {n | 0 < n ∧ ∀ d ∈ Nat.digits 10 n, d ≤ 10 ∧ (Nat.digits 10 n).head? ≠ some 0}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but has some differences from the ground truth:
1. It correctly includes the condition about digits not being 0 (via `.head? ≠ some 0`)
2. It adds an extra condition `0 < n` which isn't in the ground truth (though n=0 would fail the digits condition anyway)
3. It includes `d ≤ 10` which is redundant since digits in base 10 are always ≤9
4. The ground truth uses `digits` while the proposed uses `Nat.digits` (these are likely the same)
5. The ground truth's condition is simpler and more direct

The core logic is similar, but the proposed answer has some unnecessary conditions.
