abbrev omnimath3414_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3414 : 
  ¬ ∃ (k : ℕ), (23 - omnimath3414_answer) = 3 * k ∧ omnimath3414_answer < 23 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 9
Proposed Answer: 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find a natural number x (omnimath3414_answer) such that:
   - (23 - x) is divisible by 3 (i.e., 23 - x = 3k for some natural k)
   - x < 23
   - And we're to prove no such k exists (the ¬ ∃ part)

2. Ground truth answer is 9:
   - 23 - 9 = 14, which is not divisible by 3 (14/3 ≈ 4.666...)
   - This satisfies the condition that no k exists making 23-9 divisible by 3

3. Proposed answer is 1:
   - 23 - 1 = 22, which is not divisible by 3 (22/3 ≈ 7.333...)
   - This also satisfies the condition that no k exists making 23-1 divisible by 3

Both answers satisfy the required conditions, as neither 9 nor 1 make (23 - x) divisible by 3. The problem allows for multiple correct answers (any x where 23 - x is not divisible by 3 and x < 23), and both 1 and 9 meet this criteria.
