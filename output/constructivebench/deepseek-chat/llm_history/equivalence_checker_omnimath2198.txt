Ground Truth Answer: 7 / 2
Proposed Answer: 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the maximum value of the expression b/a + c/b + a/c under certain constraints on a, b, c.

2. The constraints are: 0 < a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ 2a.

3. The ground truth answer is 7/2 (3.5), which is a known result for this type of optimization problem with these constraints.

4. The proposed answer is 2, which is significantly lower than 7/2.

5. To verify, we can test specific values that satisfy the constraints:
   - For a = b = c = 1: expression = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 > 2
   - For a = 1, b = 1.5, c = 2: expression ≈ 1.5 + 1.333 + 0.5 = 3.333 > 2

The proposed answer of 2 is clearly too low and doesn't match the ground truth of 7/2.
