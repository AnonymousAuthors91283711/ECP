Ground Truth Answer: 51
Proposed Answer: 4^2013 - 1 - 210 * (4^2013 / 210)
Let me analyze this carefully.

1. The problem is asking for (4^2013 - 1) mod 210, which should be a number between 0 and 209.

2. The ground truth answer is 51, which is a concrete number in this range.

3. The proposed answer is an expression: 4^2013 - 1 - 210 * (4^2013 / 210)

This expression is mathematically equivalent to (4^2013 - 1) mod 210, because:
- For any integers a and b (b > 0), a mod b = a - b * floor(a/b)
- Here floor(4^2013/210) would be (4^2013 / 210) in integer division

However, the problem asks for the concrete value (51), not an equivalent expression. While the proposed answer is mathematically correct as an expression, it doesn't provide the simplified numerical answer that was requested.

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent in the context of what was asked for.
