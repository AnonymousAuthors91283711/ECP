Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 2^(n-1)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 2^(n * (n - 1) / 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a function f with:
   - f(1) = 1
   - f(2n) = n * f(n)

2. We need to find f(2^100), which means we're looking for a general formula for f(2^n).

3. Ground truth answer: f(2^n) = 2^(n-1)
   - This satisfies the base case: f(2^1) = f(2) = 1 * f(1) = 1 = 2^(1-1)
   - Inductive step: f(2^(k+1)) = f(2*2^k) = 2^k * f(2^k) = 2^k * 2^(k-1) = 2^(2k-1) = 2^((k+1)-1) when k=1, but this doesn't hold for k>1

4. Proposed answer: f(2^n) = 2^(n*(n-1)/2)
   - For n=1: 2^(1*0/2) = 1 = f(2)
   - For n=2: 2^(2*1/2) = 2 = f(4) (since f(4) = 2*f(2) = 2*1 = 2)
   - For n=3: 2^(3*2/2) = 8 = f(8) (since f(8) = 4*f(4) = 4*2 = 8)
   - This pattern holds for higher n

The ground truth answer is actually incorrect, while the proposed answer correctly describes the function's behavior. However, since the task is to compare equivalence to the ground truth, we must return:

<<<False>>>
