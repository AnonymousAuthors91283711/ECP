Ground Truth Answer: fun n => choose (n - 1) 2
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => choose n 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of ordered pairs (i,j) where i < j and π(i)*π(j) > i*j for some permutation π of {1,...,n}.

2. The ground truth answer is the binomial coefficient C(n-1, 2), which counts the number of pairs in the last n-1 elements.

3. The proposed answer is C(n, 2), which counts all possible pairs in n elements.

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It counts all possible pairs, but not all pairs will satisfy π(i)*π(j) > i*j
- The maximum is achieved by taking pairs from the largest n-1 elements (excluding the smallest element), hence C(n-1, 2) is correct
- For n=3: C(2,2)=1 is correct (only (2,3) works), while C(3,2)=3 overcounts
