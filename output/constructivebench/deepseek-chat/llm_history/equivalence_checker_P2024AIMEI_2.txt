Ground Truth Answer: 25
Proposed Answer: 80
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find x and y (both >1) that satisfy two logarithmic equations and then find their product x*y.

2. The logarithmic equations are:
   - logₓ(yˣ) = 10
   - log_y(x⁴ʸ) = 10

3. From the first equation: logₓ(yˣ) = x*logₓy = 10 ⇒ logₓy = 10/x
4. From the second equation: log_y(x⁴ʸ) = 4y*log_yx = 10 ⇒ log_yx = 10/(4y) = 2.5/y

5. Using the change of base formula: logₓy = 1/log_yx
6. Substituting: 10/x = y/2.5 ⇒ xy = 25

The ground truth answer (25) matches exactly with our derivation. The proposed answer (80) contradicts this result.
