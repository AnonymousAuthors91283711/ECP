Looking at the problem, we need to find the value of 2 * f(2) * g(2) given the system of equations for f and g. The proposed answer attempts to use the given equations but has syntax errors and incorrect grouping.

From the equations:
1. f(x) + g(x) = 3x + 5
2. f(x) - g(x) = 5x + 7

We can solve for f(x) and g(x):
- Adding equations: 2f(x) = (3x+5)+(5x+7) = 8x+12 → f(x) = 4x+6
- Subtracting equations: 2g(x) = (3x+5)-(5x+7) = -2x-2 → g(x) = -x-1

Now compute 2*f(2)*g(2):
f(2) = 4*2+6 = 14
g(2) = -2-1 = -3
2*14*(-3) = -84

The correct answer should be -84. The proposed answer had incorrect parentheses grouping and division where none was needed. Here's the corrected version:

<<<(-84 : ℝ)>>>

Explanation: The solution involves solving the system of equations to find explicit forms for f and g, then evaluating at x=2 and computing the required product. The final answer is simply the constant -84 cast to ℝ.
