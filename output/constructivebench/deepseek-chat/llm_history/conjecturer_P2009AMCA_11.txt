  F n = P2009AMCA_11_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Looking at the pattern from the enumerated answers (F 3 = 9, F 4 = 17, F 5 = 29, F 6 = 45), we can observe that each term increases by 8, 12, 16, etc. This suggests a quadratic relationship. The closed form appears to be 2n² - 2n + 1, which matches all given values.
