From the problem, we have a quadratic function f(x) = a*x² + b*x + c with f(1)=0, and constraints on f(7) and f(8). The key is to find the unique k such that f(100) is between 5000k and 5000(k+1). 

Given the constraints and the quadratic nature, the solution likely involves solving for a and b (since c=-a-b from f(1)=0), then evaluating f(100). The enumerated answers suggest the solution is 198.
