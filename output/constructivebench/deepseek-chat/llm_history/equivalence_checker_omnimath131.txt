Ground Truth Answer: 337
Proposed Answer: 24
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n > 1 where the average of the first n squares (from 1² to n²) is itself a perfect square.

2. The ground truth answer is 337. Let's verify:
   - Sum of first 337 squares = 337×338×675/6 = 337×113×225
   - Average = (337×113×225)/337 = 113×225 = 25425
   - 25425 = 159.45², which is not a perfect square (This appears incorrect - there seems to be a miscalculation here)

Wait, actually:
   - Correct sum formula: n(n+1)(2n+1)/6
   - For n=337: 337×338×675/6 = 337×169×225
   - Average: 169×225 = (13²)×(15²) = (13×15)² = 195²

3. The proposed answer is 24:
   - Sum of first 24 squares: 24×25×49/6 = 4×25×49
   - Average: 25×49 = (5×7)² = 35²

Both answers satisfy the condition, but the problem asks for the smallest such n. 24 is indeed smaller than 337 and satisfies the condition.

<<<False>>>

The proposed answer 24 is actually correct and smaller than the ground truth answer 337, making the ground truth incorrect for this problem. The smallest n > 1 where the average of first n squares is a perfect square is indeed 24.
