The error occurs because the proposed answer tries to use parameters α and β inside the set definition without declaring them. Since omnimath4202_answer needs to be a standalone definition, we should make it a function that takes α and β as arguments.

Looking at the problem, we're trying to find the set of initial values 'a' for which the recurrence relation doesn't have a solution. The recurrence relation suggests a fixed point analysis, where we'd solve x = (x + α)/(βx + 1). This leads to the quadratic equation βx² + x - x + α = 0 → βx² + α = 0, but the proposed answer had an extra 'x' term.

Based on the fixed point analysis and the error correction needed, here's the corrected answer:

<<<fun (α β : ℝ) => {a : ℝ | β * a^2 + α = 0}>>>

Explanation:
1. The answer needs to be a function taking α and β as parameters
2. The set condition comes from solving the fixed point equation x = (x + α)/(βx + 1)
3. Cross-multiplying gives: βx² + x = x + α → βx² = α → βx² + α = 0
4. This matches the pattern seen in recurrence relation analysis where non-existence occurs at fixed points[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error occurs because the proposed answer is a function returning a Set ℝ, but the expected type is just Set ℝ. Looking at the theorem statement, we need a set that depends on α and β, but the answer should be a concrete set expression.

From the problem context, we're looking for initial values 'a' where the recurrence relation fails to be defined. The condition β*a^2 + α = 0 appears to be the critical case where the denominator becomes zero in the recurrence.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<{a : ℝ | ∃ α β : ℝ, α * β > 0 ∧ β * a^2 + α = 0}>>>

Explanation:
1. The set includes all real numbers 'a' where there exist α,β with α*β > 0 that make the denominator condition fail (β*a^2 + α = 0)
2. This matches the theorem's requirement of being a Set ℝ
3. The condition captures when the recurrence relation would have division by zero
4. The αβpos condition is included to maintain consistency with the theorem's hypothesis
