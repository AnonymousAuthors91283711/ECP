From the problem conditions, we have an arithmetic sequence property (h_arith) and a geometric sequence property (h_geo). The enumerated answers suggest the ratio a/d is 1/8. The arithmetic condition implies b = a + r, c = a + 2r, d = a + 3r, while the geometric condition gives (a+r)/a = (a+3r)/(a+r). Solving these yields r = a, making d = 4a, hence a/d = 1/4.
