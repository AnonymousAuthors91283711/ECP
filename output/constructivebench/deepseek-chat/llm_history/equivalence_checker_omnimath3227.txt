theorem omnimath3227 :
  Real.log (∏ a in Finset.range 2015, ∏ b in Finset.range 2015, 
    (1 + exp (2 * π * I * (a * b : ℝ) / 2015))).re / Real.log 2 = omnimath3227_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 13725
Proposed Answer: 2015 * 2015 / 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating the real part of a complex logarithm of a product of terms involving complex exponentials, then dividing by log(2).

2. The ground truth answer is 13725, which is exactly 2015 * 13.65, but this exact form isn't immediately obvious.

3. The proposed answer suggests 2015 * 2015 / 2 = 2030112.5, which is clearly different from 13725.

4. The proposed answer doesn't account for:
   - The complex nature of the terms (1 + exp(...))
   - The fact that many terms will cancel out or simplify
   - The logarithm operation and division by log(2)

5. The ground truth answer (13725) is much smaller than the proposed answer, indicating the proposed solution doesn't correctly account for the problem's structure.
