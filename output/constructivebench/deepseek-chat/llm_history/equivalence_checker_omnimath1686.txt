Ground Truth Answer: 5/4
Proposed Answer: (1/2) * (2 + 1/2) * (2 + 1/2) * (1/2) / ((1/2 + 1/2) * (1/2 + 1/2) * 2)
Let's analyze the proposed answer step by step:

1. The ground truth answer is 5/4 (1.25), which is claimed to be the maximum value of the given expression under the constraints.

2. The proposed answer is a specific evaluation of the expression:
   (1/2) * (2 + 1/2) * (2 + 1/2) * (1/2) / ((1/2 + 1/2) * (1/2 + 1/2) * 2)

3. Calculating the proposed answer:
   Numerator: (1/2) * (2.5) * (2.5) * (1/2) = (1/2)*6.25*(1/2) = 1.5625
   Denominator: (1)*(1)*2 = 2
   Result: 1.5625/2 = 0.78125 (which is 25/32)

4. This does not equal the ground truth answer of 5/4 (1.25). The proposed answer is smaller than the claimed maximum.

5. The proposed answer appears to be evaluating a specific case where three roots are at 2 and one at 1/2, but this doesn't yield the maximum value.
