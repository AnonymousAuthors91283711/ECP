Ground Truth Answer: 7 / 12
Proposed Answer: (2 + 4 + 6) / (1 + 3 + 5) - (1 + 3 + 5) / (2 + 4 + 6)
Let's evaluate both expressions to see if they're equivalent.

Ground Truth Answer: 7/12

Proposed Answer: 
(2+4+6)/(1+3+5) - (1+3+5)/(2+4+6)
= 12/9 - 9/12
= 4/3 - 3/4
= (16-9)/12
= 7/12

The proposed answer simplifies to exactly the same value as the ground truth answer.
