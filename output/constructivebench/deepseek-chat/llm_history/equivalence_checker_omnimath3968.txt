theorem omnimath3968 :
  {(x, p) : ℕ × ℕ | x > 0 ∧ p > 0 ∧ p.Prime ∧ x ≤ 2 * p ∧ (x ^ (p - 1) ∣ (p - 1) ^ x + 1)} = omnimath3968_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 2), (3, 3)} ∪ {(1, p) | p : ℕ, p.Prime}
Proposed Answer: {(x, p) | x = 1 ∧ p.Prime} ∪ {(x, p) | x = 2 ∧ p.Prime} ∪ {(x, p) | x = p ∧ p.Prime} ∪ {(x, p) | x = p + 1 ∧ p.Prime ∧ x ≤ 2 * p}
Let me analyze the problem and compare the answers:

1. The problem asks for all pairs (x,p) where:
   - x,p > 0
   - p is prime
   - x ≤ 2p
   - x^(p-1) divides (p-1)^x + 1

2. Ground Truth Answer:
   - All pairs (1,p) where p is prime
   - Plus the specific pairs (2,2) and (3,3)

3. Proposed Answer:
   - All pairs (1,p) where p is prime (matches ground truth)
   - All pairs (2,p) where p is prime (extra cases beyond (2,2))
   - All pairs (p,p) where p is prime (includes (3,3) but also others)
   - Some additional cases where x = p+1

The proposed answer includes many invalid cases:
- (2,p) for p≠2 doesn't satisfy the divisibility condition
- (p,p) for p>3 doesn't work (e.g., (5,5) fails the condition)
- The p+1 cases are mostly incorrect

Only the (1,p) part is correct, and (p,p) happens to catch (3,3) but incorrectly includes other primes.
