From the problem statement and enumerated answers, we can observe that:
1. T is fixed at 55
2. The conditions create a system where K must satisfy both geometric and arithmetic progression constraints
3. The solution appears to be a linear function of T

The answer follows the pattern K = 3*T + 1, which satisfies all given conditions when T=55 (K=166).
