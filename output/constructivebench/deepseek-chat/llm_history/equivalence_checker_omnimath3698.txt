theorem omnimath3698 (x y z : ℕ) :
    (2013^x + 2014^y = 2015^z) ↔ (x, y, z) ∈ omnimath3698_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 1, 1)}
Proposed Answer: {(0, 1, 1), (1, 0, 1)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation is 2013^x + 2014^y = 2015^z
2. Ground truth gives only (0,1,1) as solution
3. Proposed answer adds (1,0,1) as another solution

Let's test the proposed additional solution (1,0,1):
2013^1 + 2014^0 = 2013 + 1 = 2014
2015^1 = 2015
2014 ≠ 2015, so (1,0,1) is not a valid solution.

The only valid solution is indeed (0,1,1) since:
2013^0 + 2014^1 = 1 + 2014 = 2015 = 2015^1

<<<False>>>
