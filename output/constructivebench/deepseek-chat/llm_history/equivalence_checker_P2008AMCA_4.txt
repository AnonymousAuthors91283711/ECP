Ground Truth Answer: 502
Proposed Answer: 1006
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to evaluate the product ∏ from n=0 to 501 of (4(n+2))/(4(n+1))

2. Simplifying the product:
   - The 4's cancel out: ∏ (n+2)/(n+1)
   - This becomes a telescoping product: (2/1)*(3/2)*(4/3)*...*(503/502)
   - Most terms cancel out, leaving just 503/1 = 503

3. The ground truth answer is 502, which is incorrect - the correct answer should be 503

4. The proposed answer is 1006, which is also incorrect and not equivalent to 502

Therefore, the proposed answer is not equivalent to the ground truth answer, and neither is correct.
