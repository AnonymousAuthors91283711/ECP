<<<2014>>> 

Explanation: The smallest number greater than 2013 that cannot be expressed as a sum of two palindromic numbers is 2014. This is because all numbers from 2014 onwards can be checked against the sum condition, and 2014 is the first number that fails this condition. The pattern from enumeration shows this is the minimal solution.
