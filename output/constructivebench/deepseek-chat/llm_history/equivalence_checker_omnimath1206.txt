Ground Truth Answer: fun a b c => (1 / (a + 1)) + (1 / (b + 1)) + (1 / (c + 1))
Proposed Answer: fun a b c => a^2 + b^2 + c^2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a cubic equation (X-a)(X-b)(X-c) = X³ - X + 1, which means a, b, c are roots of X³ - X + 1 = 0.

2. From Vieta's formulas, we know:
   - a + b + c = 0 (coefficient of X²)
   - ab + bc + ca = -1 (coefficient of X)
   - abc = -1 (constant term)

3. The ground truth answer is the sum of reciprocals of (a+1), (b+1), (c+1).

4. The proposed answer is simply the sum of squares of the roots.

5. We can compute a² + b² + c² using the identity:
   a² + b² + c² = (a+b+c)² - 2(ab+bc+ca) = 0 - 2(-1) = 2

6. The ground truth answer evaluates to -2 (as given in the theorem statement).

7. The proposed answer evaluates to 2, which is different from -2.

The two answers are clearly different (2 vs -2), and there's no domain or special case where they would be equal.
