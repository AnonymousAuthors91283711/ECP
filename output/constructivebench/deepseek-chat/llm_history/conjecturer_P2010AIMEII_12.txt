From the problem statement and enumerated answers, we can deduce that we're looking for the smallest p satisfying certain conditions involving two pairs (a₁,b₁) and (a₂,b₂). The key constraints are:
1. b₁*b₂ = 56 (from 8*7)
2. The pairs must satisfy the area condition involving square roots
3. The pairs must be distinct

The minimal p likely comes from the smallest integer solutions where b₁ and b₂ are factors of 56 (like 7 and 8). Through enumeration, the smallest valid p is found to be 21.
