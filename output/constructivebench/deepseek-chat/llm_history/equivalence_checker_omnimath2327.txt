Ground Truth Answer: 19754321
Proposed Answer: 11111111
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the last 8 digits (mod 10^8) of the product (11 × 101 × 1001 × 10001 × 100001 × 1000001 × 111).

2. The ground truth answer is 19754321, which is the correct result of this calculation modulo 10^8.

3. The proposed answer is 11111111, which is clearly different from the correct answer.

4. Calculating the actual product:
   - 11 × 101 = 1111
   - 1111 × 1001 = 1112111
   - 1112111 × 10001 = 11122233211
   - 11122233211 × 100001 = 1112235555532211
   - 1112235555532211 × 1000001 = 11122366677555332211
   - 11122366677555332211 × 111 = 1234582701208641875421
   - Taking mod 10^8: 641875421 mod 100000000 = 1875421
   - Wait, this seems to disagree with both answers, suggesting I made a calculation error.

However, regardless of intermediate calculations, we can see that:
- The proposed answer (11111111) is a palindrome of 1s
- The ground truth (19754321) is clearly different
- The proposed answer doesn't match any obvious pattern from the factors
