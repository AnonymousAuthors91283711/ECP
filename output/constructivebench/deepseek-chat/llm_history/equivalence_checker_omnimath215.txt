Ground Truth Answer: fun k => (k ^ 2 - 4) ^ 2 / (4 * k * (k ^ 2 + 4))
Proposed Answer: fun k => (k^3 - 3 * k) / (k^2 - 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives an equation relating x, y and k, and asks to express a more complex expression in terms of k.

2. The ground truth answer is a rational function of k: (k² - 4)²/(4k(k² + 4))

3. The proposed answer is a different rational function: (k³ - 3k)/(k² - 2)

To check equivalence:
- Let's test with k = 3:
  - Ground truth: (9-4)²/(4*3*(9+4)) = 25/156 ≈ 0.160
  - Proposed: (27-9)/(9-2) = 18/7 ≈ 2.571
The values are clearly different.

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
