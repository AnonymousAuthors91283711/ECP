Ground Truth Answer: 5/72
Proposed Answer: (1/2)^3 * (1/3)^2 * (1/6)^1 * 60
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer step by step.

1. The problem is calculating a multinomial probability with:
   - n = 6 total trials
   - k = [3, 2, 1] counts for outcomes A, M, C
   - p = [1/2, 1/3, 1/6] probabilities for A, M, C respectively

2. The multinomial coefficient is:
   6! / (3! * 2! * 1!) = 720 / (6 * 2 * 1) = 720 / 12 = 60

3. The probability part is:
   (1/2)³ * (1/3)² * (1/6)¹

4. The proposed answer combines these correctly:
   (1/2)³ * (1/3)² * (1/6)¹ * 60

5. Calculating this:
   (1/8) * (1/9) * (1/6) * 60 = (1/432) * 60 = 60/432 = 5/36

Wait, this doesn't match the ground truth of 5/72. There seems to be a miscalculation.

Looking back at the probabilities:
- p_M is defined as 2*(1-p_A)/3 = 2*(1/2)/3 = 1/3 (correct in proposed answer)
- p_C is defined as (1-p_A)/3 = (1/2)/3 = 1/6 (correct in proposed answer)

But when we calculate the final value:
(1/8)*(1/9)*(1/6)*60 = 60/432 = 5/36 ≠ 5/72

The proposed answer's expression is correct, but the simplification is wrong. The correct simplification should be 5/36, not 5/72. Therefore, while the expression is correct, the final value is incorrect.
