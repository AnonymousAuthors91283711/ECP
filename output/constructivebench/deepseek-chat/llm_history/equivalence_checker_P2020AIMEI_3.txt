Ground Truth Answer: 621
Proposed Answer: 350
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number N that can be expressed in two ways:
   - As a 3-digit number in base 11 (a11² + b11 + c) where a,b,c < 11 and a < 8, b < 8, c < 8
   - As a number in base 8 (1·8³ + b·8² + c·8 + a)

2. The ground truth answer is 621. Let's verify it:
   - In base 11: 5·11² + 1·11 + 5 = 605 + 11 + 5 = 621
   - In base 8: 1·8³ + 1·8² + 5·8 + 5 = 512 + 64 + 40 + 5 = 621
   - All digits satisfy a=5 < 8, b=1 < 8, c=5 < 8

3. The proposed answer is 350. Let's check:
   - In base 11: 2·11² + 10·11 + 8 = 242 + 110 + 8 = 360 ≠ 350
   - Also, c=8 violates c < 8 constraint
   - The answer doesn't satisfy the equation N = a·11² + b·11 + c = 1·8³ + b·8² + c·8 + a

The proposed answer is completely incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the given conditions, and the calculations don't match.
