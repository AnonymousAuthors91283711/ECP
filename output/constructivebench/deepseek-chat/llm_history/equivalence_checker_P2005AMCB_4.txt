    n = (totalQuizzes - 30) - remainingA} 
  (P2005AMCB_4_answer (totalQuizzes, firstA)) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun ⟨totalQuizzes, firstA⟩ => 
    let remainingQuizzes := totalQuizzes - 30
    let requiredA := (4 * totalQuizzes / 5) - firstA
    remainingQuizzes - requiredA
Proposed Answer: fun ⟨totalQuizzes, firstA⟩ => totalQuizzes - 30 - (4 * totalQuizzes / 5 - firstA)
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer:
   - Computes remainingQuizzes = totalQuizzes - 30
   - Computes requiredA = (4 * totalQuizzes / 5) - firstA
   - Returns remainingQuizzes - requiredA

2. Proposed Answer:
   - Computes totalQuizzes - 30 - (4 * totalQuizzes / 5 - firstA)

These are mathematically equivalent because:
- The proposed answer is just the ground truth answer written in one expression without the intermediate variables
- Both compute the same final value: (totalQuizzes - 30) - ((4 * totalQuizzes / 5) - firstA)

The order of operations and grouping is identical in both cases, just written differently.
