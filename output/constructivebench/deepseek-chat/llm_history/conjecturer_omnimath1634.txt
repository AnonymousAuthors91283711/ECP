From the problem description and the recursive definition of set S (which includes 0 and is closed under 3x and 3x+1 operations), the set S corresponds to numbers whose ternary representations contain only 0s and 1s. The count of such numbers between 0 and 2008 (exclusive) can be calculated by finding the largest power of 3 ≤ 2008 and using binary counting for the digits.
