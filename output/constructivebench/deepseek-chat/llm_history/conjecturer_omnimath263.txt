theorem omnimath263 (n : ℕ) (hn : n > 0) :
  (∃ (k : ℕ) (hk : k ≥ 2) (a : Fin k → ℚ) (ha : ∀ i, 0 < a i),
    (∑ i, a i = n) ∧ (∏ i, a i = n)) ↔ n ∈ omnimath263_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{n | ∃ p : ℕ, n = p^p}>>> 

Explanation: The pattern suggests numbers that are perfect powers of themselves (p^p). The enumerated answers (1,4,27,256,...) match this form. This satisfies both sum and product conditions when decomposed into p copies of p.
