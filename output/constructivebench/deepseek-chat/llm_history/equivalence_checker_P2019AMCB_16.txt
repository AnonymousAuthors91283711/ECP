Ground Truth Answer: 15/256
Proposed Answer: 1 / 8
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a recursive sequence p(n) with specific base cases and a recurrence relation for n < 10. The key points are:
   - p(0) = 1
   - p(3) = p(6) = p(11) = 0
   - p(10) = 1
   - For other n < 10, p(n) = (p(n+1) + p(n+2))/2

2. The ground truth answer is 15/256 ≈ 0.0586
3. The proposed answer is 1/8 = 0.125

The proposed answer (1/8) is significantly different from the ground truth (15/256). The problem asks for p(0), which is given as 1 in the problem statement, but the answers seem to be referring to some other value (perhaps the probability calculation based on the recurrence).

Since the answers are clearly different and the proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth, the correct response is:

<<<False>>>
