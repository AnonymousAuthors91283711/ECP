Ground Truth Answer: {k | 3 < k}
Proposed Answer: {r | ∃ p q : ℕ, p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ p ≠ q ∧ r = p + q}
<<<Close>>>

The proposed answer is close but not entirely equivalent to the ground truth. The ground truth answer includes all natural numbers greater than 3, while the proposed answer only includes numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two distinct primes. While all sums of two distinct primes are indeed greater than 3 (since the smallest primes are 2 and 3, giving 2+3=5), not all numbers greater than 3 can be expressed as such sums (e.g., 4 cannot be expressed as a sum of two distinct primes). Therefore, the proposed answer is a proper subset of the ground truth answer.
