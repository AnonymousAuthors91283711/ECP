Ground Truth Answer: 2 / 3
Proposed Answer: 1 / 2 + sqrt (1 / 12)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us three equations:
   - q ≤ p
   - p + q + 1/6 = 1 → p + q = 5/6
   - p² + q² + (1/6)² = 1/2 → p² + q² = 17/36

2. From p + q = 5/6, we can express q = 5/6 - p

3. Substitute into the second equation:
   p² + (5/6 - p)² = 17/36
   p² + 25/36 - (5/3)p + p² = 17/36
   2p² - (5/3)p + 8/36 = 0
   2p² - (5/3)p + 2/9 = 0

4. Solving this quadratic equation:
   p = [5/3 ± √((25/9) - 16/9)] / 4
   p = [5/3 ± √(1)] / 4
   p = (5/3 ± 1)/4

5. This gives two solutions:
   p = (5/3 + 1)/4 = (8/3)/4 = 2/3
   p = (5/3 - 1)/4 = (2/3)/4 = 1/6

6. The proposed answer is 1/2 + √(1/12) = 1/2 + (√3)/6 ≈ 0.5 + 0.2887 ≈ 0.7887
   The ground truth 2/3 ≈ 0.6667

7. The proposed answer doesn't match either solution (2/3 or 1/6). It's also larger than 2/3, which would violate q ≤ p since p + q = 5/6 would make q negative.
