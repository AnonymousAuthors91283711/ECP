abbrev omnimath3475_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3475 (x : ℝ) (hx : x < -2) :
  IsLeast {y : ℝ | y = x ∨ y = x + 2 ∨ y = (1/2) * x ∨ y = x - 2 ∨ y = 2 * x} (omnimath3475_answer x) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 2 * x
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℝ => min (2 * x) (x - 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the least element in the set {x, x+2, (1/2)x, x-2, 2x} when x < -2.

2. For x < -2:
   - 2x will be the smallest since:
     - 2x < x (since x < 0)
     - 2x < x+2 (since x < -2 ⇒ x+2 < 0, and 2x is more negative)
     - 2x < (1/2)x (since x < 0, multiplying by 1/2 makes it less negative)
     - 2x < x-2 (similar to x+2 case)

3. The ground truth correctly identifies 2x as always being the minimum in this case.

4. The proposed answer suggests min (2*x) (x-2), which is incorrect because:
   - For x < -2, 2x is always less than x-2 (since x < -2 ⇒ 2x < x-2)
   - While the minimum would still be 2x, the inclusion of x-2 is unnecessary and suggests the solver didn't fully recognize that 2x is strictly less than all other options
