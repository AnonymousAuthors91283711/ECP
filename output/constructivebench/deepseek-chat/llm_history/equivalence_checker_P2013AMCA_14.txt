Ground Truth Answer: 270
Proposed Answer:  450
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding x such that the sequence [logb 162 12, logb x 12, logb y 12, logb z 12, logb 1250 12] forms an arithmetic sequence.

2. The ground truth answer is x = 270.

3. The proposed answer is x = 450.

To check equivalence:

1. First, let's examine the sequence structure. For an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms should be constant.

2. The sequence has 5 terms, so we can write:
   logb x 12 - logb 162 12 = logb y 12 - logb x 12 = ... = d (common difference)

3. Using logarithm properties, we can rewrite:
   logb (x/162) 12 = logb (y/x) 12 = ... = d

4. This implies the ratio between consecutive arguments should be constant:
   x/162 = y/x = z/y = 1250/z = k (common ratio)

5. Therefore, x = 162k, y = 162k², z = 162k³, and 1250 = 162k⁴

6. Solving 1250 = 162k⁴ gives k⁴ = 1250/162 = 625/81 ⇒ k = (625/81)^(1/4) = 5/3

7. Thus x = 162*(5/3) = 270

The proposed answer 450 doesn't satisfy this calculation (450 = 162*(50/18) which doesn't match our derived k value).
