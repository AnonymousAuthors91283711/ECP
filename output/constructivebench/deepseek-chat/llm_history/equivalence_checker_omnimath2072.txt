Ground Truth Answer: (27 * sqrt 6 / 8) * π
Proposed Answer: (4 * Real.pi * (sqrt 3) ^ 3) / 27
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: (27 * sqrt 6 / 8) * π
2. Proposed: (4 * π * (sqrt 3)^3) / 27

First, let's simplify both expressions:

Ground Truth:
(27 * sqrt 6 / 8) * π = (27 * π * sqrt 6)/8

Proposed:
(4 * π * (sqrt 3)^3)/27 = (4 * π * 3 * sqrt 3)/27 = (12 * π * sqrt 3)/27 = (4 * π * sqrt 3)/9

Now let's compare the simplified forms:
(27 * π * sqrt 6)/8 vs (4 * π * sqrt 3)/9

These are clearly different expressions. The coefficients (27/8 vs 4/9) and the radicals (sqrt 6 vs sqrt 3) don't match.
