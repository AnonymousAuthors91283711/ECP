Ground Truth Answer: {1, 3, 5, 15}
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | n ∣ 15}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer {n : ℕ | n ∣ 15} is almost correct but includes 0, which doesn't satisfy the condition 0 < n in the problem statement. The ground truth answer {1, 3, 5, 15} correctly lists only the positive divisors of 15. The expressions are equivalent when restricted to n > 0, but the proposed answer is technically incorrect as it would include 0 if not for the explicit constraint.
