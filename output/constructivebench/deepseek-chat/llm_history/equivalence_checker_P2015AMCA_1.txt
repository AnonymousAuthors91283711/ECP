noncomputable abbrev P2015AMCA_1_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2015AMCA_1 :
  (5 * ((2^0 - 1 + 5^2 - 0)^(-1 : ℝ)) = P2015AMCA_1_answer) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1/5
Proposed Answer: 5 / 24
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is evaluating the expression: 5 * ((2^0 - 1 + 5^2 - 0)^(-1 : ℝ))
2. Let's compute the denominator step by step:
   - 2^0 = 1
   - 1 - 1 = 0
   - 5^2 = 25
   - 25 - 0 = 25
   - So the denominator is 25^(-1) = 1/25
3. Now multiply by 5: 5 * (1/25) = 5/25 = 1/5
4. The ground truth answer is 1/5 (correct)
5. The proposed answer is 5/24 (incorrect)

The proposed answer doesn't match the correct computation. The correct simplification leads to 1/5, not 5/24.
