Ground Truth Answer: 14
Proposed Answer: 2049
Let's analyze this problem carefully.

1. The problem asks for the greatest natural number n such that 2^n divides (7^2048 - 1).

2. The ground truth answer is 14, which suggests this is about finding the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of (7^2048 - 1).

3. The proposed answer is 2049, which is clearly incorrect because:
   - 7^2048 - 1 is much smaller than 2^2049 (since 7 < 2^3)
   - The exponent of 2 in such expressions typically grows logarithmically, not linearly
   - For similar problems (like 3^n-1), the exponent of 2 is known to be small

4. The correct approach would involve using the Lifting the Exponent Lemma (LTE) or examining the pattern of exponents in powers of odd numbers modulo powers of 2.

The proposed answer (2049) is clearly wrong compared to the ground truth (14).
