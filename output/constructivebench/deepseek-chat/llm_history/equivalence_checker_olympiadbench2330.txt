Ground Truth Answer: {(1, -4, -2), (3, 2, 3), (13, 2, -2)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, y, (9 - 1)/y) | y : ℝ} ∪ {(3, 2, z) | z : ℝ} ∪ {(x, 2, (9 - x)/2) | x : ℝ}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

The problem asks for all real triples (x,y,z) that satisfy three equations:
1. (x-1)(y-2) = 0
2. (x-3)(z+2) = 0
3. x + y*z = 9

The ground truth answer provides three specific solutions that satisfy all equations. The proposed answer provides three infinite families of solutions.

Key observations:
1. The first equation implies x=1 or y=2
2. The second equation implies x=3 or z=-2
3. The proposed answer's first set {(1, y, (9-1)/y)} only satisfies the equations when y=2 (from equation 1) or z=-2 (from equation 2), but doesn't enforce these constraints
4. Similarly, the other two sets in the proposed answer don't properly account for all constraints

The proposed answer includes many solutions that don't satisfy all three original equations, while the ground truth answer correctly identifies only the exact solutions that satisfy all constraints.
