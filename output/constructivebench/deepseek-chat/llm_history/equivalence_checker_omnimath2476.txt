Ground Truth Answer: 773
Proposed Answer: 309
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find coprime natural numbers a and b such that:
   - 100a + b equals some answer (omnimath2476_answer)
   - a = isosceles/gcd(isosceles, total)
   - b = total/gcd(isosceles, total)
   - Where n = 2020, total = n(n-1)(n-2)/6, isosceles = n(n-1)

2. Calculating the values:
   - n = 2020
   - total = 2020×2019×2018/6 = 2020×673×2018/2 = 1010×673×2018
   - isosceles = 2020×2019 = 2020×3×673

3. Finding gcd(isosceles, total):
   - gcd(2020×3×673, 1010×673×2018)
   - = 673 × gcd(2020×3, 1010×2018)
   - = 673 × 1010 × gcd(2×3, 2018)
   - = 673 × 1010 × 2 = 1,359,460

4. Calculating a and b:
   - a = isosceles/gcd = (2020×2019)/1,359,460 = 4,060,380/1,359,460 ≈ 2.987 → Not integer!
   - Wait, this suggests the proposed answer 309 can't be correct since a isn't even an integer.

5. The ground truth answer 773 would correspond to:
   - 100a + b = 773
   - Possible coprime pairs: (7,73) or (3,473) etc., but none seem to match the required conditions.
