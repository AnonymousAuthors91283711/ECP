Looking at the problem, we need to find a real number α in [-π/2, π/2] such that the imaginary part of a complex product equals sin(α). The product involves roots of unity (ω = e^(2πi/727)) raised to powers of 3^(k-1).

Key observations:
1. The product involves terms of form 1 + ω^m + ω^(2m), which are sums of roots of unity
2. For roots of unity, such sums are either 0 or real numbers (when the exponents form complete residue systems mod 3)
3. The imaginary part of a real number is 0
4. sin(0) = 0, and 0 ∈ [-π/2, π/2]

The error in the original statement appears to be a syntax issue with the ∃ quantifier placement. The correct answer should be 0 since the product is real-valued and thus has zero imaginary part.
