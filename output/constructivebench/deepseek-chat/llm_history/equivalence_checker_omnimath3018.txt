Ground Truth Answer: 25
Proposed Answer: 14
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find a 3-element subset of {1,2,4,8,16,20} whose product is 80 and then give the sum of that subset.

2. First, let's find all possible 3-element subsets and check their products:
   - {1,2,20}: 1*2*20 = 40 ≠ 80
   - {1,4,20}: 1*4*20 = 80 (sum = 25)
   - {2,4,10}: 10 not in set
   - {1,5,16}: 5 not in set
   - {2,5,8}: 5 not in set
   - {4,5,4}: duplicates and 5 not in set
   - The only valid subset is {1,4,20}

3. The sum of {1,4,20} is 25 (ground truth), not 14 (proposed).

4. The proposed answer 14 doesn't correspond to any valid subset that satisfies the conditions.
