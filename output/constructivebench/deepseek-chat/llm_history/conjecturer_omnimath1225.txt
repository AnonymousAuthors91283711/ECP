Based on the problem statement involving square roots and rationalization, I'll propose a corrected answer that matches the expected type ℕ × ℕ. The expression (2*(√2 + √10))/(5*√(3+√5)) simplifies to 4/5 when rationalized, which explains why ⟨4, 5⟩ is a reasonable conjecture.

Here's the corrected answer in Lean syntax:

<<<⟨4, 5⟩>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem involves simplifying a complex radical expression to a rational form r/s
2. The numerator (2*(√2 + √10)) and denominator (5*√(3+√5)) suggest rationalization is needed
3. Through algebraic manipulation (multiplying numerator and denominator by conjugate), the expression simplifies to 4/5
4. 4 and 5 are coprime natural numbers, satisfying all conditions
5. The enumerated answers likely confirmed this pattern

The error in the original submission was due to incorrect delimiter usage - the answer should just be the term itself without the << >> markers when placed in the abbreviation definition.
