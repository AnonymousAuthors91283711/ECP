Ground Truth Answer: 158
Proposed Answer: 159
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a sequence t(n) = 555 - 7n and S(n) as the partial sum of t(i) from i=1 to n.

2. We need to find the smallest n where S(n) < 0.

3. Calculating S(n):
   - This is an arithmetic series sum: S(n) = n*(t(1) + t(n))/2
   - t(1) = 555 - 7 = 548
   - t(n) = 555 - 7n
   - So S(n) = n*(548 + 555 - 7n)/2 = n*(1103 - 7n)/2

4. Solving S(n) < 0:
   n*(1103 - 7n) < 0
   Since n > 0, we need 1103 - 7n < 0 => n > 1103/7 ≈ 157.571

5. The smallest integer n satisfying this is n = 158 (ground truth).

The proposed answer is 159, which is the next integer after the correct solution. This is incorrect because:
- At n=158: S(158) = 158*(1103 - 7*158)/2 = 158*(-3)/2 = -237 < 0
- At n=157: S(157) = 157*(1103 - 7*157)/2 = 157*4/2 = 314 > 0

Therefore, 158 is indeed the smallest n where S(n) < 0.
