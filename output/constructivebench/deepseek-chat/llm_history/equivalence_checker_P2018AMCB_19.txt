Ground Truth Answer: 340
Proposed Answer: 646
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest divisor d (immediately following 323) of an even number n between 1000-10000 that's divisible by 323.

2. Key constraints:
   - n is even
   - 1000 ≤ n < 10000
   - 323 divides n
   - 323 appears in the ordered list of divisors
   - d is the next divisor after 323

3. Ground truth is 340, which makes sense because:
   - 323 × 340 = 109820 (too big)
   - Actually, the minimal n would be 323 × 4 = 1292 (even, in range)
   - Divisors of 1292: 1, 2, 4, 17, 19, 34, 38, 68, 76, 323, 646, 1292
   - After 323 comes 646 (the proposed answer)
   - But 340 is not even a divisor of any valid n in this range

4. The proposed answer 646 is correct for n=1292, which is the smallest valid n meeting all conditions.

The ground truth answer appears to be incorrect, while the proposed answer is correct.
