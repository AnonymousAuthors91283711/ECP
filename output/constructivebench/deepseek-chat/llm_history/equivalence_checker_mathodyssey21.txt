Ground Truth Answer: (251, 7)
Proposed Answer: (509, 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for natural numbers (a,b) where a is prime and b > 0 that satisfy the given equation.

2. The ground truth answer is (251, 7). Let's verify it:
Left side: 9*(2*251 + 7)^2 = 9*509^2 = 9*259081 = 2331729
Right side: 509*(4*251 + 511*7) = 509*(1004 + 3577) = 509*4581 = 2331729
This checks out.

3. The proposed answer is (509, 1). Let's verify it:
Left side: 9*(2*509 + 1)^2 = 9*1019^2 = 9*1038361 = 9345249
Right side: 509*(4*509 + 511*1) = 509*(2036 + 511) = 509*2547 = 1296423
9345249 ≠ 1296423, so this doesn't satisfy the equation.

The proposed answer does not satisfy the given equation, while the ground truth does.

<<<False>>>
