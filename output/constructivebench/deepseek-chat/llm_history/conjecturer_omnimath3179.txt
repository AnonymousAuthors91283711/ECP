From the problem statement and the pattern of the enumerated answers, we can deduce that we're looking for the count of odd numbers k in 1..99 that satisfy a specific equation condition. The key observation is that the equation simplifies when considering powers of 2, and the condition requires exactly 2 solution pairs (m,n) for each k.
