Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 8 * 251 + 4
Let me analyze this problem and the answers.

The problem is about finding the exponent k such that the coefficient of X^2012 in (1+X+X^2+...+X^7)^8 equals 2^k. This is a generating function problem where we're looking for the number of solutions to x1 + x2 + ... + x8 = 2012 where each xi is between 0 and 7.

The ground truth answer is 6, meaning the coefficient equals 2^6 = 64.

The proposed answer is 8*251 + 4 = 2012, which is simply restating the exponent we're looking for (2012) in a different form. This doesn't relate to the actual problem of finding the power of 2 in the coefficient.

The proposed answer is completely incorrect as it doesn't address the actual question being asked. It's just a trivial manipulation of the number 2012 rather than solving for the power of 2 in the coefficient.
