Ground Truth Answer: 8041
Proposed Answer: 4021 * 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. First, we need to solve for p using the given equation:
   (3p - q) - p = (3p + q) - (3p - q)
   Simplifying both sides:
   Left side: 2p - q
   Right side: 2q
   So: 2p - q = 2q → 2p = 3q → p = 1.5q

2. Given q = 9, so p = 13.5

3. Now calculate (3p + q) + 2010 * ((3p + q) - (3p - q)):
   - 3p + q = 40.5 + 9 = 49.5
   - 3p - q = 40.5 - 9 = 31.5
   - Difference: 49.5 - 31.5 = 18
   - Final expression: 49.5 + 2010 * 18 = 49.5 + 36180 = 36229.5

Wait, this doesn't match either answer. There must be a mistake in the problem statement or answers.

Looking at the proposed answer (4021 * 9 = 36189) and ground truth (8041), neither matches our calculation. The proposed answer is closer to our calculation but still off by 40.5.

Given that neither answer matches our calculation and they don't match each other, the correct response is:

<<<False>>>
