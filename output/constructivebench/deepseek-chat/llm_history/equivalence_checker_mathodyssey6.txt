  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∃ k m : ℕ, 3 * n + 1 = k^2 ∧ 5 * n + 1 = m^2} mathodyssey6_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 16
Proposed Answer: 40
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n such that:
   - 3n + 1 is a perfect square (k²)
   - 5n + 1 is a perfect square (m²)

2. Ground truth answer is 16:
   - 3*16 + 1 = 49 = 7²
   - 5*16 + 1 = 81 = 9²
   - This satisfies both conditions

3. Proposed answer is 40:
   - 3*40 + 1 = 121 = 11²
   - 5*40 + 1 = 201, which is not a perfect square (14²=196, 15²=225)
   - Only satisfies the first condition

The proposed answer fails the second condition (5n + 1 being a perfect square), while the ground truth answer satisfies both conditions. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
