Ground Truth Answer: (sqrt 5 - 1) / 2
Proposed Answer: 1 / Real.sqrt 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the value of p where the area of the set {(x,y) ∈ [0,1]×[0,1] | x > p or y > p} equals 1 - p².

2. The area can be calculated as:
   Total area (1) minus area where x ≤ p AND y ≤ p (which is p²)
   So area = 1 - p² when p ∈ [0,1]

3. However, the condition is that this equals 1 - p², which suggests we're looking for p where the area condition holds for all p ∈ [0,1]. But this seems trivial unless there's more to it.

4. The ground truth answer is (√5 - 1)/2 ≈ 0.618 (the golden ratio conjugate)
   The proposed answer is 1/√2 ≈ 0.707

5. These are clearly different numerical values, and only one can be correct. The golden ratio conjugate is known to appear in various geometric probability problems, making it more likely to be correct.
