Looking at the problem statement and the conditions, we need to find a relationship between the zeros and coefficients of a quadratic polynomial where the sum of zeros equals their product, which in turn equals the sum of coefficients. The proposed answer seems to be trying to express a continued fraction relationship, but it's not matching the problem's requirements.

From the conditions:
1. sum_zeros = -b/a
2. prod_zeros = c/a
3. sum_coeffs = a + b + c
And we have sum_zeros = prod_zeros = sum_coeffs

Let's solve these equations step by step:
1. -b/a = c/a ⇒ -b = c
2. c/a = a + b + c ⇒ c/a = a + b - b ⇒ c/a = a ⇒ c = a²
3. From (1) and (2): -b = a² ⇒ b = -a²

Therefore, the solution must satisfy b = -a² and c = a². The answer should express one of these variables in terms of the others. The simplest closed form is to express c in terms of a and b, but since b is determined by a, we can express the relationship purely in terms of a.

<<<fun a b c => a^2>>> 

Explanation:
The conditions lead us to c = a² as the fundamental relationship. This satisfies all three equalities:
1. sum_zeros = -b/a = -(-a²)/a = a
2. prod_zeros = c/a = a²/a = a
3. sum_coeffs = a + b + c = a - a² + a² = a
Thus all three quantities equal a, and c must be a².
