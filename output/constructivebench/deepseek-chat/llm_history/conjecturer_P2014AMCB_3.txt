Looking at the problem, we need to solve the equation x/3 + 20 + x/5 = x for x > 0. Let's solve it step by step:

1. Combine like terms: x/3 + x/5 = (5x + 3x)/15 = 8x/15
2. The equation becomes: 8x/15 + 20 = x
3. Subtract 8x/15 from both sides: 20 = x - 8x/15 = 7x/15
4. Multiply both sides by 15/7: x = 20 * (15/7) = 300/7

The error occurs because Lean requires noncomputable operations on real numbers to be explicitly marked. Since we're working with ℝ (real numbers) and division, we need to mark the definition as noncomputable.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2014AMCB_3_answer : ℝ := 300 / 7>>>

The solution follows from basic algebraic manipulation of the given equation. The key steps involve finding a common denominator for the fractional terms and isolating x. The answer 300/7 is exact and matches the algebraic solution. The noncomputable annotation is necessary because real number division in Lean isn't computable by default.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The solution follows from basic algebraic manipulation of the given equation. The key steps involve finding a common denominator for the fractional terms and isolating x. The answer 300/7 is exact and satisfies the original equation when substituted back. The noncomputable annotation is necessary because real number operations in Lean aren't guaranteed to be computable in general.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

4. Multiply both sides by 15/7: x = 20 * (15/7) = 300/7

The error occurs because Lean requires noncomputable declarations for real number operations. The correct answer is indeed 300/7, but we need to mark it as noncomputable.

Here's the fixed answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2014AMCB_3_answer : ℝ := 300 / 7>>>

The explanation is:
1. We solve the linear equation algebraically to find x = 300/7
2. Since this involves real number division, we need the noncomputable annotation
3. The answer matches the enumerated solution and satisfies the original equation when substituted back in
