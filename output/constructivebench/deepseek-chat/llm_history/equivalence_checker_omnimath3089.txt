Ground Truth Answer: 32
Proposed Answer: 24
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a set of integer pairs (p₁, p₂) where:
   - p₂ = 4*p₁ + 3
   - 25 < p₁ < 75
   - 120 < p₂ < 250

2. To find the number of valid pairs:
   - First, find the range for p₁ that satisfies all conditions
   - From p₂ > 120: 4p₁ + 3 > 120 ⇒ p₁ > 117/4 ⇒ p₁ ≥ 30
   - From p₂ < 250: 4p₁ + 3 < 250 ⇒ p₁ < 247/4 ⇒ p₁ ≤ 61
   - Combined with 25 < p₁ < 75, we get p₁ ∈ [26, 74] ∩ [30, 61] = [30, 61]

3. Count of valid p₁ values: 61 - 30 + 1 = 32

The ground truth answer (32) is correct. The proposed answer (24) is incorrect as it undercounts the valid pairs.
