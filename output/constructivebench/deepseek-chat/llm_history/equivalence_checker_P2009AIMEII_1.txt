Ground Truth Answer: 114
Proposed Answer: 130 + 164 + 188 - 3 * 130
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem is about finding a number (P2009AIMEII_1_answer) that satisfies several conditions involving variables b, r, w, p. The key conditions are:
1. 130 - b = 164 - r = 188 - w (let's call this common difference 'd')
2. The sum b + r + w + p = (130 + 164 + 188) - answer

From the first condition, we can express:
b = 130 - d
r = 164 - d
w = 188 - d

The ground truth answer is 114, which comes from:
d = (130 + 164 + 188 - (130 + 164 + 188 - 114))/3 = 38
Then b = 130 - 38 = 92, r = 164 - 38 = 126, w = 188 - 38 = 150
And the sum b + r + w = 92 + 126 + 150 = 368
Which matches (130 + 164 + 188) - 114 = 482 - 114 = 368

The proposed answer is 130 + 164 + 188 - 3*130 = 482 - 390 = 92
This doesn't match the ground truth answer of 114.
