theorem olympiadbench2349 :
  (∑ k in Finset.range 89, (sin (π * (k + 1) / 180))^6) = (olympiadbench2349_answer.1 : ℝ) / olympiadbench2349_answer.2 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: (221, 8)
Proposed Answer: (89, 4)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves summing (sin⁶θ) from θ=1° to θ=89° (since π*(k+1)/180 converts to degrees).

2. The ground truth answer is 221/8, which equals 27.625.

3. The proposed answer is 89/4, which equals 22.25.

4. For verification, let's consider a few test cases:
   - Sum of sin⁶(1°) + sin⁶(89°) ≈ 0 + 1 = 1
   - Sum of sin⁶(30°) + sin⁶(60°) ≈ (0.5)⁶ + (√3/2)⁶ ≈ 0.0156 + 0.4219 ≈ 0.4375
   The proposed sum of 22.25 seems too low compared to these partial sums, while 27.625 is more plausible.

5. The proposed answer (89/4) is incorrect as it doesn't match the ground truth (221/8).
