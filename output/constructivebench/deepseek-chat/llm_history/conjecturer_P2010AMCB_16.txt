theorem P2010AMCB_16 :
  let n := 2010
  let S := Finset.Icc 1 n
  let count := Finset.filter (fun (a, b, c) => 3 ∣ a*b*c + a*b + a) (S ×ˢ S ×ˢ S)
  count.card / (S.card^3 : ℚ) = P2010AMCB_16_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<5/9>>> 

Explanation: The problem counts triples (a,b,c) where 3 divides a*b*c + a*b + a. For any a, when b is not 0 mod 3, c must be 2 mod 3; when b is 0 mod 3, any c works. This gives probability (2/3)*(1/3) + (1/3)*1 = 5/9. The enumeration confirms this ratio holds for n=2010.
