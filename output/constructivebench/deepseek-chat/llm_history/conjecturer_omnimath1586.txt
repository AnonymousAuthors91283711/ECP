From the problem statement and the recurrence relations, we can deduce that:
1. `a` is linear (arithmetic sequence)
2. `g` is geometric
3. The combined sequence `a + g` must satisfy the given initial conditions

Looking at the pattern from the enumerated answers and solving the system of equations, we get:
<<<fun n : ℕ => (n - 2) * (n - 3) * (n - 4) / 2>>>
