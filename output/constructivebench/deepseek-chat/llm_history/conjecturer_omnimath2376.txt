From the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we're looking for the minimal ratio of imaginary to real part (y/x) of complex numbers z = x + yi where x,y ≥ 0, |z² + 2| ≤ |z|. The minimal ratio occurs when z lies on the boundary of the condition. 

After analyzing the boundary condition and symmetry, the minimal ratio occurs when z is purely real (y=0) doesn't satisfy the inequality, so we look for the next simplest case. The minimal ratio appears to be when z lies on the line x = y.
