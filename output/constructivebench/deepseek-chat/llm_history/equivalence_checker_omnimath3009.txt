Ground Truth Answer: 59
Proposed Answer: 52
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have four equations involving four variables (a, b, c, d)
2. Each equation gives the average of three of the four variables
3. The ground truth answer is 59
4. The proposed answer is 52

To check equivalence, let's solve the system:

From the equations:
(a+b+c) = 96 (from h₁)
(a+b+d) = 117 (from h₂)
(a+c+d) = 120 (from h₃)
(b+c+d) = 132 (from h₄)

Adding all four equations:
3(a+b+c+d) = 96 + 117 + 120 + 132 = 465
=> a+b+c+d = 155

Now we can find each variable:
d = 155 - 96 = 59
c = 155 - 117 = 38
b = 155 - 120 = 35
a = 155 - 132 = 23

The maximum of these is max(max(23,35), max(38,59)) = 59

The proposed answer (52) doesn't match any of these values and is incorrect as the maximum.
