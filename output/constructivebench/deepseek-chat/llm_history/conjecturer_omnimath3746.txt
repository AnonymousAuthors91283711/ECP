Based on the problem statement and error message, I can see that:
1. The problem is about showing no quadratic polynomial over ℕ evaluates to powers of 2 for all natural inputs
2. The current proposed answer has a syntax error (missing closing parenthesis)
3. The answer should be a Prop stating the non-existence of such polynomial

The correct formulation should properly close all parentheses and match the theorem statement. Here's the fixed version:

<<<¬∃ (f : ℕ[X]), degree f = 2 ∧ ∀ (n : ℕ), ∃ (k : ℕ), eval n f = 2^k>>>

Explanation:
1. The original had unclosed parentheses and incorrect placement of quantifiers
2. The fixed version directly negates the existence of a quadratic polynomial (degree 2) where all evaluations at natural numbers are powers of 2
3. This matches the theorem statement's biconditional structure
4. The formulation is more concise while maintaining the same logical meaning
