open Function Real

abbrev omnimath3582_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3582 (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
  (∀ x y, f (f y) + f (x - y) = f (x * f y - x)) ↔ f = omnimath3582_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun _ => 0
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℝ => 1 - x
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is a functional equation: ∀ x y, f(f y) + f(x - y) = f(x * f y - x)

2. The ground truth answer is the zero function: f(x) = 0 for all x

3. The proposed answer is the linear function: f(x) = 1 - x

Let's test if the proposed solution satisfies the equation:
For f(x) = 1 - x:
Left side: f(f y) + f(x - y) = (1 - (1 - y)) + (1 - (x - y)) = y + 1 - x + y = 1 - x + 2y
Right side: f(x * f y - x) = 1 - (x*(1-y) - x) = 1 - (x - xy - x) = 1 + xy

These are not equal (1 - x + 2y ≠ 1 + xy), so the proposed solution doesn't satisfy the equation.

The zero function does satisfy it:
Left side: 0 + 0 = 0
Right side: 0 = 0
