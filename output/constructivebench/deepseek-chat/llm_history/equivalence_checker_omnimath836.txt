Ground Truth Answer: 49 / 36
Proposed Answer: (9 - Real.sqrt 17) / 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves two positive real numbers x and y (x < y) with given conditions on their square roots.

2. The ground truth answer is a simple fraction 49/36 ≈ 1.3611.

3. The proposed answer is (9 - √17)/2 ≈ (9 - 4.1231)/2 ≈ 2.4384.

The two answers are numerically different (1.3611 vs 2.4384), and they are clearly not equivalent expressions. The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the original conditions when plugged back in.

<<<False>>>
