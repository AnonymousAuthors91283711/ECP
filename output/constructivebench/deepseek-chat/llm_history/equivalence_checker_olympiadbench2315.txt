Ground Truth Answer: 60
Proposed Answer: 40
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation given is:
   (10*(1 + n/100)*75*(1 - n/100)) * (15*(1 + n/100)*75*(1 - n/100)) = 345600

2. Simplifying the equation:
   - Notice that (1 + n/100)(1 - n/100) = (1 - (n/100)^2)
   - The equation becomes: (10*75*(1 - (n/100)^2)) * (15*75*(1 - (n/100)^2)) = 345600
   - Which simplifies to: 750(1 - (n/100)^2) * 1125(1 - (n/100)^2) = 345600
   - Or: 843750(1 - (n/100)^2)^2 = 345600

3. Solving:
   - (1 - (n/100)^2)^2 = 345600/843750 ≈ 0.4096
   - 1 - (n/100)^2 = ±0.64
   - Taking the positive root (since n is between 0 and 100):
     (n/100)^2 = 0.36 → n/100 = 0.6 → n = 60

The ground truth answer (60) is correct, while the proposed answer (40) is incorrect.
