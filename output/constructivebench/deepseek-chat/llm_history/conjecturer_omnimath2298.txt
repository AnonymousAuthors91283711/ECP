From the problem, we see we need to find a function that takes a pair (5,101) representing midpoint coordinates and returns a + b. The conditions describe two distinct points on a parabola y=x² whose midpoint is (5,101). The general solution for such points (x₁,x₂) would satisfy x₁ + x₂ = 10 (from midpoint condition) and x₁² + x₂² = 202. 

The answer can be derived from these conditions and the given equations a*x + b = x². The pattern suggests the answer is simply the sum of the y-coordinate and the negative of the x-coordinate squared.
