noncomputable abbrev mathodyssey180_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem mathodyssey180 (modelWidth actualWidth : ℝ) (h : modelWidth = 1.2) : 
    actualWidth = mathodyssey180_answer modelWidth := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun modelWidth => (modelWidth * 10) / 3
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℝ => x / 1.2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a function that relates modelWidth to actualWidth, with the constraint that when modelWidth = 1.2, the equation holds.

2. Ground Truth Answer: (modelWidth * 10) / 3
   - When modelWidth = 1.2: (1.2 * 10)/3 = 12/3 = 4

3. Proposed Answer: x / 1.2
   - When x = 1.2: 1.2/1.2 = 1

The two answers give different results when modelWidth = 1.2 (4 vs 1), and they are clearly different functions. The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the given constraint.

<<<False>>>
