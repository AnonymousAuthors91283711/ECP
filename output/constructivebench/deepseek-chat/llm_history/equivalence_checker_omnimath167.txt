Ground Truth Answer: 25
Proposed Answer: 6
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n ≥ 2 where 2^(2^n) mod (2^n - 1) is not a power of 4.

2. The ground truth answer is 25, meaning that n=25 is the smallest number satisfying this condition.

3. The proposed answer is 6, suggesting that n=6 is the smallest such number.

To verify, let's test n=6:
- Compute 2^6 - 1 = 63
- Compute 2^(2^6) = 2^64
- 2^64 mod 63 = 1 (since 2^6 ≡ 1 mod 63, so 2^64 = (2^6)^10 * 2^4 ≡ 1^10 * 16 ≡ 16 mod 63)
- 16 is indeed a power of 4 (4^2 = 16), so n=6 doesn't satisfy the condition.

Therefore, the proposed answer of 6 is incorrect, as it doesn't satisfy the given condition. The ground truth answer of 25 appears to be correct.
