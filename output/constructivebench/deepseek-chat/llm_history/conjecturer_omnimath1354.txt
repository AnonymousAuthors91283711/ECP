theorem omnimath1354
(a b : ℕ → ℝ)
(hab0 : a 0 = -2 ∧ b 0 = 1)
(habn : ∀ n : ℕ, a (n + 1) = a n + b n + Real.sqrt ((a n) ^ 2 + (b n) ^ 2) ∧ b (n + 1) = a n + b n - Real.sqrt ((a n) ^ 2 + (b n) ^ 2))

Looking at the pattern from enumerated answers (not shown but implied), the sequences aₙ and bₙ appear to grow exponentially. The recurrence suggests a relationship where each term combines the previous terms with their Euclidean norm. The solution likely involves powers of 2 and the golden ratio φ.
