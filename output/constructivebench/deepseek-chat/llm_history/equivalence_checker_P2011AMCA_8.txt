Ground Truth Answer: 25
Proposed Answer: 20
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer step by step.

Given:
1. C = 5 (hC)
2. A + B + 5 = 30 (h1)
3. B + 5 + D = 30 (h2)
4. 5 + D + E = 30 (h3)
5. D + E + F = 30 (h4)
6. E + F + G = 30 (h5)
7. F + G + H = 30 (h6)

From h1 and h2:
A + B = 25 (from h1)
B + D = 25 (from h2)
Thus A = D

From h2 and h3:
B + D = 25 (from above)
D + E = 25 (from h3)
Thus B = E

From h3 and h4:
D + E = 25 (from above)
E + F = 30 - D (from h4)
But since D + E = 25 and E = B, we can continue:

From h4 and h5:
D + E + F = 30
E + F + G = 30
Thus D = G

From h5 and h6:
E + F + G = 30
F + G + H = 30
Thus E = H

Now we know:
A = D = G
B = E = H

From h1: A + B = 25
We need A + H = A + B = 25

The proposed answer is 20, but the correct answer is 25.
