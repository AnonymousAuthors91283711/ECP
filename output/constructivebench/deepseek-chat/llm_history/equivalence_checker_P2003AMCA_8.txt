Ground Truth Answer: 1/2
Proposed Answer: 1/4
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem is about finding the probability that a positive divisor of 60 is less than 7.

2. First, we need to find all positive divisors of 60:
   - 60 = 2² × 3 × 5
   - Number of divisors = (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12
   - Divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60

3. Now count favorable cases (divisors < 7):
   - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 → 6 divisors

4. Probability = favorable/total = 6/12 = 1/2

The ground truth answer (1/2) is correct. The proposed answer (1/4) is incorrect as it counts only half of the correct favorable cases.
