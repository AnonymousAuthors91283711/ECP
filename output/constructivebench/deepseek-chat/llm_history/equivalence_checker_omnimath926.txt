Ground Truth Answer: {-(5 * Real.pi) / 12, -(Real.pi) / 12, (Real.pi) / 12, (5 * Real.pi) / 12}
Proposed Answer: {x | x = Real.arcsin (Real.sqrt (3 / 4))} ∪ {x | x = -Real.arcsin (Real.sqrt (3 / 4))}
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. First, let's simplify the equation from the problem:
   1 - sin⁴x - cos²x = 1/16
   This can be rewritten as:
   sin⁴x + cos²x = 15/16

2. Using the identity sin²x + cos²x = 1, we can substitute and get:
   sin⁴x + (1 - sin²x) = 15/16
   sin⁴x - sin²x + 1/16 = 0

3. Let y = sin²x, then:
   y² - y + 1/16 = 0
   The solutions are y = (1 ± √(1 - 1/4))/2 = (1 ± √(3/4))/2 = (1 ± √3/2)/2

4. The positive solutions are:
   y = (1 + √3/2)/2 = (2 + √3)/4
   y = (1 - √3/2)/2 = (2 - √3)/4

5. The proposed answer only considers one of these solutions (√(3/4) = √3/2), which corresponds to:
   sin x = ±√3/2 ⇒ x = ±π/3 + 2πn

However, this doesn't match the ground truth answer, which includes ±π/12 and ±5π/12. These correspond to the other solution:
sin x = ±√((2 - √3)/4) = ±(√3 - 1)/(2√2), which gives x = ±π/12 and ±5π/12 when considering the domain (-π/2, π/2).

The proposed answer misses half of the solutions and includes x = ±π/3 which aren't in the ground truth answer.
