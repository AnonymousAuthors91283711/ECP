<<<2021>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks for the smallest k such that for any 2021 pairwise coprime numbers, there exists a collection of k nonempty subsets with distinct products. The answer is simply 2021, as we can take all singleton subsets, whose products are just the original numbers which are distinct by coprimality.
