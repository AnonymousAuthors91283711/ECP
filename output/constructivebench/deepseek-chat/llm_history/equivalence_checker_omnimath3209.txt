Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation given is: m + 1/(n + 1/p) = 17/3
2. We know m, n, p are positive natural numbers
3. The ground truth says n = 1 when m = 5 and p = 2
4. The proposed answer says n = 3 when m = 5 and p = 2

Let's test both answers:

For ground truth (n=1):
5 + 1/(1 + 1/2) = 5 + 1/(3/2) = 5 + 2/3 = 17/3 ✓ Correct

For proposed answer (n=3):
5 + 1/(3 + 1/2) = 5 + 1/(7/2) = 5 + 2/7 ≈ 5.2857 ≠ 17/3 (≈5.6667) ✗ Incorrect

The proposed answer does not satisfy the equation, while the ground truth does.

<<<False>>>
