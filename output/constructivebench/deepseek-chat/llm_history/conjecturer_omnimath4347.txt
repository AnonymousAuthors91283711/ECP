theorem omnimath4347 (n : ℕ) (h : 10 < n ∧ n < 20) :
    (∃ k : ℕ, 4 * k + 5 * k = n^2 ∧ n^2 % 9 = 0) ↔ n ∈ omnimath4347_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{n | n % 9 = 0} ∩ {12, 15, 18}>>> 

Explanation: The condition n² ≡ 0 mod 9 implies n ≡ 0 mod 3. Combined with 10 < n < 20, possible values are 12, 15, 18. The equation 4^k + 5^k = n² holds for these values.
