<<<17>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks for the number of periodic functions (period 17) satisfying given recurrence relations. Since it's over ZMod 17 and has period 17, there are exactly 17 possible functions (one for each possible value of f(1) through f(17)). The recurrence relations don't reduce this count.
