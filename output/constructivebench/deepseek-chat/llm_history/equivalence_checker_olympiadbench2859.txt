theorem olympiadbench2859 (T : ℕ) :
  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | let k := 21 + 2 * T;
                     let f := fun n => 2 * n^2 - k * n + 77;
                     f n > 0 ∧ Nat.Prime (f n)} (olympiadbench2859_answer T) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun T => 12  -- The answer is constant regardless of T
Proposed Answer: fun T : ℕ => 2 * T + 10
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the greatest natural number n such that:
   - f(n) = 2n² - (21 + 2T)n + 77 is positive
   - f(n) is prime

2. The ground truth answer claims this is always 12, regardless of T.

3. The proposed answer suggests it's 2T + 10.

Analysis:
- For T=1 (k=23), f(12)=2*144-23*12+77=288-276+77=89 (prime)
- For T=1, proposed answer gives 12 (same as ground truth)
- For T=2 (k=25), f(12)=2*144-25*12+77=288-300+77=65 (not prime)
  - f(11)=2*121-25*11+77=242-275+77=44 (not prime)
  - f(10)=200-250+77=27 (not prime)
  - The correct answer would actually be lower than 12 for T=2

The proposed answer matches the ground truth only when T=1, but fails for other values. The ground truth answer of constant 12 is incorrect for most T values, while the proposed answer is also incorrect as it grows linearly with T when the actual solution should be more complex.
