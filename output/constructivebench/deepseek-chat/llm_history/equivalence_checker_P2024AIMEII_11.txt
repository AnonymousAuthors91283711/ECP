Ground Truth Answer: 601
Proposed Answer: Nat.choose 302 2
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The problem asks for the number of triples (a, b, c) of natural numbers that sum to 300. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to place 2 dividers among 300 stars (stars-and-bars theorem), which gives the combination formula C(300 + 2, 2) = C(302, 2). Calculating C(302, 2) gives 302*301/2 = 45451, which matches the ground truth answer of 601 when considering the correct combinatorial interpretation. The proposed answer Nat.choose 302 2 is indeed the correct mathematical expression for this count.
