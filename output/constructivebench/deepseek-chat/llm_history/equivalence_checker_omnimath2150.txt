theorem omnimath2150 : 
  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | n.digits 10 ~ [2, 0, 1, 9] ∧ n % 7 = 0 ∧ (n.digits 10).length = 4} omnimath2150_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1092
Proposed Answer: 9201
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the greatest 4-digit number where:
   - The digits are a permutation of [2,0,1,9]
   - The number is divisible by 7
   - It has exactly 4 digits

2. Ground truth answer is 1092:
   - Digits: [1,0,9,2] (permutation of [2,0,1,9])
   - 1092 ÷ 7 = 156 (divisible by 7)
   - 4-digit number

3. Proposed answer is 9201:
   - Digits: [9,2,0,1] (valid permutation)
   - 9201 ÷ 7 ≈ 1314.428... (not divisible by 7)
   - 4-digit number

The proposed answer fails the divisibility by 7 condition, while the ground truth answer satisfies all conditions.
