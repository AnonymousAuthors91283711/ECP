Ground Truth Answer: 7
Proposed Answer: 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the number of odd integers n that satisfy 17/4 < n < 35/2
2. First, let's convert the inequalities:
   - 17/4 = 4.25
   - 35/2 = 17.5
3. So we're looking for odd integers n where 4.25 < n < 17.5
4. The integer range is n ∈ [5, 17]
5. Odd numbers in this range: 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 → total of 7 numbers

The ground truth answer is 7, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 5, which is incorrect as it's missing two odd numbers from the range.
