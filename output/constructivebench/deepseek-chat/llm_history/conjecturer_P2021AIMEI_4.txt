theorem P2021AIMEI_4 :
  {((a, b, c) : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ) | a + b + c = 66 ∧ a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ c > 0 ∧ a < b ∧ b < c}.ncard = P2021AIMEI_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the problem, we need to count the number of ordered triples (a,b,c) where a+b+c=66 with 0<a<b<c. This is equivalent to counting combinations of three distinct positive integers summing to 66. The closed form solution for such problems is typically a triangular number. From enumeration patterns, the answer follows the formula for combinations where we subtract non-distinct cases.
