Ground Truth Answer: 500
Proposed Answer: 1250
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the count of 4-digit numbers (1000-9999) where:
   - The thousands digit is even
   - The hundreds digit is even
   - The tens digit is even
   - The units digit is even

2. For a 4-digit number:
   - Thousands digit: 1-9 (but must be even, so 2,4,6,8) → 4 choices
   - Hundreds digit: 0-9 (must be even) → 0,2,4,6,8 → 5 choices
   - Tens digit: same as hundreds → 5 choices
   - Units digit: same → 5 choices

3. Total numbers = 4 (thousands) × 5 (hundreds) × 5 (tens) × 5 (units) = 4 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 500

The ground truth answer (500) is correct. The proposed answer (1250) is incorrect as it appears to have miscalculated the constraints (possibly by allowing 0 in the thousands place or miscounting the even digits).
