Ground Truth Answer: 17
Proposed Answer: 20
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives an equation involving P and x, where P cancels out, leaving us to solve for x.

2. Simplifying the equation:
   (P * 1.2) * 0.8 * 1.25 * (1 - x/100) = P
   => 1.2 * 0.8 * 1.25 * (1 - x/100) = 1
   => 1.2 * 1.0 * (1 - x/100) = 1 (since 0.8*1.25=1)
   => 1.2 * (1 - x/100) = 1
   => 1 - x/100 = 1/1.2 ≈ 0.8333
   => x/100 ≈ 0.1667
   => x ≈ 16.67

3. Rounding x gives us 17, which matches the ground truth answer.

4. The proposed answer is 20, which is incorrect based on the calculations.
