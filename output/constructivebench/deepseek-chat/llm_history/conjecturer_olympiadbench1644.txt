Based on the problem statement and the constraints, this appears to be about tiling a grid with dominoes under specific placement rules. The enumerated answers suggest the maximum number of non-overlapping dominoes follows a pattern based on m and n. The key observation is that for each j < n, there's a forced domino placement, and the remaining space allows for additional dominoes.
