Looking at the sequence definition and the enumerated answers, the pattern suggests we're looking for the smallest k where the product of terms becomes an integer. The sequence appears to grow exponentially with base 2, and the exponents form a recurrence relation. The minimal k occurs when the accumulated exponent becomes integer.
