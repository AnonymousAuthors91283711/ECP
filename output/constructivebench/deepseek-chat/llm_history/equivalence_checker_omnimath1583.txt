Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0), (0, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4), (2, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(i, j) | i = j ∨ i + j = 4}
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem is about finding all positions (i,j) in a 5×5 matrix where you can toggle the position and all positions in its row and column, such that after some sequence of such toggles, only position (i,j) is true.

2. The ground truth answer gives specific positions: the four corners and the center.

3. The proposed answer gives a condition: positions where i=j or i+j=4 (the main diagonal and anti-diagonal).

For a 5×5 matrix:
- The main diagonal (i=j) gives: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)
- The anti-diagonal (i+j=4) gives: (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0)

Comparing with the ground truth:
- Both include (0,0), (4,4), (0,4), (4,0), (2,2)
- But proposed answer additionally includes (1,1), (3,3), (1,3), (3,1) which are not in ground truth

The proposed answer is incorrect because it includes more positions than the ground truth. The extra positions cannot satisfy the problem's conditions.
