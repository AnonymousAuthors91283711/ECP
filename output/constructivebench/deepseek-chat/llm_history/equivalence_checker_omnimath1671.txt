Ground Truth Answer: (-13 / 96, 13 / 40)
Proposed Answer: (1/7, -1/4)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is a system of two equations with two variables (x,y) with several constraints (x≠0, y≠0, x²+y²≠0).

2. The ground truth answer is (-13/96, 13/40).

3. The proposed answer is (1/7, -1/4).

Let's test if the proposed answer satisfies the original equations:

First equation: x/√(x²+y²) - 1/x = 7
For (1/7, -1/4):
(1/7)/√((1/7)²+(-1/4)²) - 1/(1/7) ≈ 0.4857 - 7 ≈ -6.5143 ≠ 7

Second equation: y/√(x²+y²) + 1/y = 4
(-1/4)/√((1/7)²+(-1/4)²) + 1/(-1/4) ≈ -0.8499 - 4 ≈ -4.8499 ≠ 4

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy either equation, while the ground truth answer does (as stated in the problem).

<<<False>>>
