theorem P2011AMCB_4 :
  ∃ (a b : ℕ), 10 ≤ a ∧ a < 100 ∧

Ground Truth Answer: 224
Proposed Answer: 161
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find two-digit numbers a (where 10 ≤ a < 100) and b such that:
   - The "digit-reversed" version of a multiplied by b equals 161
   - The product of a and b equals the answer (P2011AMCB_4_answer)

2. The ground truth answer is 224, meaning a × b = 224
3. The proposed answer is 161, which would mean a × b = 161

However, the problem states that the digit-reversed version of a multiplied by b equals 161 (not a × b itself). The proposed answer is confusing the two products - it's giving the value that should be the result of (digit-reversed a) × b, not a × b.

The correct answer should be the value of a × b (224), not the intermediate result (161). Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
