Ground Truth Answer: 448
Proposed Answer: 2002 - 364 - 286 - 154 + 182 + 143 + 77 - 1001
Let's analyze the proposed answer step by step:

1. The problem is counting numbers from 0 to 2001 that are divisible by certain combinations of 11, 13, and 14, with different weights assigned to each case.

2. The proposed answer appears to be using the inclusion-exclusion principle:
   - 2002 is the total range (0 to 2001)
   - Subtract numbers divisible by 11 (2002/11 = 182, but 182*11=2002, so 182-1=181)
   - Subtract numbers divisible by 13 (2002/13=154)
   - Subtract numbers divisible by 14 (2002/14=143)
   - Add back numbers divisible by both 11 and 13 (2002/143=14)
   - Add back numbers divisible by both 11 and 14 (2002/154=13)
   - Add back numbers divisible by both 13 and 14 (2002/182=11)
   - Subtract numbers divisible by all three (2002/2002=1)

3. However, the numbers don't match the correct inclusion-exclusion calculation:
   - Correct calculation would be: 2002 - (181+154+143) + (14+13+11) - 1 = 1561
   - The proposed answer gives 2002 - 364 - 286 - 154 + 182 + 143 + 77 - 1001 = 599

4. The ground truth answer is 448, which is different from both calculations.

The proposed answer is attempting an inclusion-exclusion approach but with incorrect numbers and operations, and doesn't match the ground truth.
