abbrev omnimath3504_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3504 (x : ℝ) : 
  x / 2 < x^2 ∧ x^2 < x ↔ x ∈ omnimath3504_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {x | x / 2 < x^2 ∧ x^2 < x}
Proposed Answer: Iio (-1/2) ∪ Ioo (1/2) 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the set of real numbers x where x/2 < x² and x² < x.

2. The ground truth answer is the direct set definition {x | x/2 < x² ∧ x² < x}.

3. The proposed answer is Iio (-1/2) ∪ Ioo (1/2) 1, which means:
   - All x < -1/2
   - All x between 1/2 and 1 (not including endpoints)

Let's verify the proposed answer:
- For x < -1/2:
  - x/2 < x² (since x is negative, x² is positive while x/2 is negative)
  - x² < x (since for x < -1, x² > x, but for -1 < x < -1/2, x² < x)
  - Actually, x² < x only holds for -1 < x < 0, not all x < -1/2

- For 1/2 < x < 1:
  - x/2 < x² holds (since x > 1/2)
  - x² < x holds (since 0 < x < 1)

The proposed answer is partially correct but:
1. It incorrectly includes all x < -1/2 when only -1 < x < -1/2 should be included
2. It misses 0 < x < 1/2 where the inequalities also hold (x/2 < x² < x holds for 0 < x < 1/2)

Therefore, the proposed answer is not fully correct.
