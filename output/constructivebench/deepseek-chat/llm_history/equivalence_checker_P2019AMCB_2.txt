Ground Truth Answer: 27
Proposed Answer: 25
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a natural number n where:
   - n is not prime
   - n-2 is not prime
   - This number should serve as a counterexample to the statement "for all non-prime n, n-2 is prime"

2. The ground truth answer is 27:
   - 27 is not prime (3×9)
   - 25 (27-2) is not prime (5×5)
   - This correctly satisfies all conditions

3. The proposed answer is 25:
   - 25 is not prime (5×5)
   - 23 (25-2) is prime
   - This fails the second condition since 23 is prime

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the problem's requirements because while 25 is not prime, 23 (25-2) is prime. The problem specifically asks for cases where both n and n-2 are not prime.
