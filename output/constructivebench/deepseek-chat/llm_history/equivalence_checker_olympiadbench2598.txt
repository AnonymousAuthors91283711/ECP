Ground Truth Answer: 1938
Proposed Answer: 1976
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem states that in 2014, Charlie's age was twice the last two digits of his birth year.
2. Let's denote birth year as 1900 + y where y is between 0 and 99.
3. The equation becomes: 2014 - (1900 + y) = 2 * y
   => 114 - y = 2y
   => 114 = 3y
   => y = 38
4. Therefore, the birth year should be 1900 + 38 = 1938.

The proposed answer is 1976, which would give:
2014 - 1976 = 38
1976 % 100 = 76
But 38 ≠ 2 * 76, so this doesn't satisfy the condition.
