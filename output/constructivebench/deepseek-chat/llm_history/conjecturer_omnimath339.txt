The error occurs because Lean doesn't recognize the set comprehension notation `{n^2 + n | n ∈ ℕ}` directly. In Lean, we need to use proper set constructors. Based on the problem statement and the pattern of perfect squares and pronic numbers (numbers of form n² + n), here's the corrected version:

<<<{L : ℕ | ∃ n : ℕ, L = n^2 ∨ L = n^2 + n}>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem involves finding numbers L where the sum S(L) is a perfect square.
2. The sum S(L) = ∑ floor(n/2) from 1 to L suggests we're looking for numbers that are either perfect squares (n²) or pronic numbers (n² + n).
3. The corrected version uses Lean's set notation with an existential quantifier and disjunction to represent the union of these two sequences.
4. This matches the pattern seen in the original attempt `{n^2 + n | n ∈ ℕ} ∪ {n^2 | n ∈ ℕ}` but uses proper Lean syntax.
