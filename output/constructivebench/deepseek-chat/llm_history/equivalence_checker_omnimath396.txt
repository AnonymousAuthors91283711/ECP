Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: 728
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest positive integer c that:
   - Can be expressed as a product of two numbers (a and b), each of which is a sum of two cubes of integers
   - But c itself cannot be expressed as a sum of two cubes of integers

2. Ground truth answer is 4:
   - 4 can be expressed as 1*4 where:
     - 1 = 1³ + 0³
     - 4 cannot be expressed as sum of two cubes (the closest is 1³ + 1³ = 2)
   - This is indeed the smallest such number

3. Proposed answer is 728:
   - 728 can be expressed as 8*91 where:
     - 8 = 2³ + 0³
     - 91 = 4³ + (-3)³
   - 728 itself cannot be expressed as sum of two cubes
   - However, this is not the smallest such number (4 is smaller)

The proposed answer satisfies the conditions but is not the minimal solution. The ground truth answer (4) is indeed smaller and satisfies all conditions.
