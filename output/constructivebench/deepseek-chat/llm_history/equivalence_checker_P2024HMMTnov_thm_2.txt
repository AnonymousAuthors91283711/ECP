Ground Truth Answer: 49
Proposed Answer: 68
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n ≥ 2 where for any two positive integers a and b that sum to n, at least one of them must have a digit sum of 7 or more.

2. The ground truth answer is 49. Let's verify this:
   - For n=49, any pair (a,b) where a+b=49 will have at least one number with digit sum ≥7. For example, (40,9) has 4+0=4 and 9=9; but (39,10) has 3+9=12 and 1+0=1 - this seems to contradict. Wait, actually 49 might not be correct as we found a counterexample (39,10).

3. The proposed answer is 68. Let's check:
   - For n=68, any decomposition will require at least one number to have digit sum ≥7. For example:
     - (59,9): 5+9=14 and 9=9
     - (60,8): 6+0=6 and 8=8 (but 8≥7)
     - (49,19): 4+9=13 and 1+9=10
   - All cases seem to satisfy the condition.

4. Checking smaller numbers:
   - For n=59: (50,9) has 5+0=5 and 9=9 (9≥7) - but (49,10) has 4+9=13 and 1+0=1 (both conditions fail)
   - So 59 doesn't work, but 68 seems to be the smallest number where all decompositions satisfy the condition.

The ground truth answer of 49 appears incorrect as we found counterexamples, while 68 seems correct. Therefore:

<<<False>>>
