<<<4 / 25>>> 

Explanation: The problem involves counting permutations where Charlie is adjacent to either Chris or Abby in position. For a fixed pair, there are 2*(T-1)! valid permutations (2 choices for order, (T-1)! ways to arrange others). With 2 possible pairs (Charlie-Chris and Charlie-Abby), total valid permutations are 4*(T-1)!. Probability is 4*(T-1)!/T! = 4/T. For T=25, answer is 4/25.
