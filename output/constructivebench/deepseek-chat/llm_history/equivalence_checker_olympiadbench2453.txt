Ground Truth Answer: {8, 32, 44, 68, 80}
Proposed Answer: {n | n % 12 = 0}
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem asks for even numbers n < 100 where we can partition numbers 1..n into three disjoint sets A (odds), B (evens), C (multiples of 3) with equal sum.

2. The ground truth gives specific numbers {8, 32, 44, 68, 80} that satisfy this condition.

3. The proposed answer claims all multiples of 12 satisfy this condition.

4. Checking the ground truth:
   - 8: Not divisible by 12
   - 32: Not divisible by 12
   - 44: Not divisible by 12
   - 68: Not divisible by 12
   - 80: Not divisible by 12

5. The proposed answer misses all the correct numbers from ground truth and includes many numbers (like 12, 24, 36, etc.) that aren't in the ground truth.
