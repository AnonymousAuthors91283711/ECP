theorem P2004AMCB_15 :
  ∃ (j b : ℕ),
    j < 100 ∧ b < 100 ∧
    j / 10 = b % 10 ∧ j % 10 = b / 10 ∧
    j + 5 = 2 * (b + 5) ∧
    |(j - b : ℤ)| = P2004AMCB_15_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the conditions:
1. j and b are 2-digit numbers (j < 100, b < 100)
2. j is the reverse of b (from digit conditions)
3. j + 5 = 2*(b + 5) → j = 2b + 5
4. We need to find |j - b|

From j = rev(b) and j = 2b + 5, testing 2-digit numbers gives solution j=73, b=34. Then |73-34|=39.

<<<39>>>
