Ground Truth Answer: 16
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. First, we calculate K, which is the sum of digits of T=2069 in base 10:
   digits(10, 2069) = [2, 0, 6, 9]
   K = 2 + 0 + 6 + 9 = 17

2. Then we calculate D:
   D = 18² - 4*K = 324 - 68 = 256

3. The square root of D:
   √D = √256 = 16

4. Now calculate r and s:
   r = (18 + 16)/2 = 34/2 = 17
   s = (18 - 16)/2 = 2/2 = 1

5. Finally, the absolute difference:
   |r - s| = |17 - 1| = 16

The ground truth answer is 16, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 4, which is incorrect.
