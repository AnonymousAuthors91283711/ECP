Ground Truth Answer: 21
Proposed Answer: 58
Let me analyze this problem carefully.

1. First, let's understand the function A(n):
   - A(0) = 0
   - A(1) = 2
   - For n+1, if n+1 is a perfect square, A(n+1) = sqrt(n+1)
   - Otherwise, A(n+1) = A(n) + 1

2. Given T = 7, K = 9*T = 63
3. We need to compute A(63)

Let's compute A(n) step by step:
- A(0) = 0
- A(1) = 2
- A(2) = A(1) + 1 = 3 (2 not square)
- A(3) = 4 (3 not square)
- A(4) = sqrt(4) = 2 (4 is square)
- A(5) = A(4) + 1 = 3
- Continue this way up to A(63)

The key observation is that whenever we hit a perfect square (4,9,16,25,36,49), the value resets to its square root, then increments by 1 until the next square.

Calculating all the way to A(63):
- The squares ≤63 are 4,9,16,25,36,49
- The pattern shows A(n) increases by 1 between squares, then drops at squares
- Final calculation shows A(63) = 21

The proposed answer is 58, which is incorrect. The correct answer is indeed 21.
