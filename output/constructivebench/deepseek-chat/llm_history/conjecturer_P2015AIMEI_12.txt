theorem P2015AIMEI_12 :
  let n := 2015
  let k := 1000
  let p := ∑ m in range n, choose (n - m) (k - 1)
  let q := choose n k
  let d := Nat.gcd p q
  p / d + q / d = P2015AIMEI_12_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern in the problem and the enumeration, the key observation is that p simplifies to choose (n+1) k and d = gcd (choose (n+1) k) (choose n k) = choose n k, making the final expression n+2.
