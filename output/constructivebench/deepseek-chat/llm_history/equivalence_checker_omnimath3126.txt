Ground Truth Answer: 14
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us an equation that must hold for all real x:
   (x + a)(x + 8) = x² + b x + 24

2. Let's expand the left side:
   x² + (8 + a)x + 8a = x² + b x + 24

3. For this to hold for all x, the coefficients must be equal:
   - Coefficient of x: 8 + a = b
   - Constant term: 8a = 24

4. Solving 8a = 24 gives a = 3
5. Then from 8 + a = b, we get b = 11
6. Therefore a + b = 3 + 11 = 14

The ground truth answer is 14, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 4, which is incorrect.
