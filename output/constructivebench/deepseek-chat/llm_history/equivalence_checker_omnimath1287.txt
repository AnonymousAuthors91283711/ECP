Ground Truth Answer: 67950
Proposed Answer: 90 * (6 * 5 / 2) ^ 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting the number of 6×6 binary matrices where:
   - Each row has exactly two 0s
   - Each column has exactly two 0s

2. The ground truth answer is 67950, which is known to be correct for this problem (equivalent to counting the number of 6×6 0-1 matrices with exactly two 0s per row and column).

3. The proposed answer is 90 * (6 * 5 / 2) ^ 2:
   - (6*5/2) = 15, which is C(6,2) - the number of ways to place two 0s in a row
   - 15^2 = 225
   - 90 * 225 = 20250, which is not equal to 67950

The proposed answer is incorrect in both its formulation and final value. The correct count is known to be 67950, which can be derived using more advanced combinatorial methods (counting the number of ways to pair up the rows).
