Ground Truth Answer: fun (m, n) => m + n
Proposed Answer: fun (m, n) => if m = 1 ∧ n = 4 then 11 else if m = 3 ∧ n = 4 then 11 else 0
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem is about finding m+n when p=m/n satisfies a certain binomial probability equation where m and n are coprime.

2. The ground truth answer states that for any valid (m,n) pair, the answer should be m+n, and specifically when this equals 11.

3. The proposed answer only returns 11 for two specific cases (m=1,n=4) and (m=3,n=4), and 0 otherwise.

4. The proposed answer is incomplete because:
   - It doesn't cover all possible solutions (there might be other (m,n) pairs that satisfy the equation and sum to 11)
   - It returns 0 for valid inputs that don't match the specific cases
   - It doesn't follow the general pattern of returning m+n

The proposed answer is partially correct in that it identifies some correct cases, but fails to provide a complete solution.
