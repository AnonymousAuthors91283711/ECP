Ground Truth Answer: 25
Proposed Answer: 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number K' such that the distance between the complex numbers (15 + 5i) and (1 + K'i) is ≥ 15*(8/5) = 24.

2. The distance between two complex numbers (a+bi) and (c+di) is √[(a-c)² + (b-d)²].

3. Calculating the distance:
   √[(15-1)² + (5-K')²] ≥ 24
   √[14² + (5-K')²] ≥ 24
   196 + (5-K')² ≥ 576
   (5-K')² ≥ 380
   |5-K'| ≥ √380 ≈ 19.49

4. Solving for K':
   K' ≤ 5 - 19.49 ≈ -14.49 (invalid since K' must be positive)
   or K' ≥ 5 + 19.49 ≈ 24.49

5. Therefore, the smallest natural number K' satisfying this is 25.

The proposed answer is 5, which is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the inequality (|5-5| = 0 ≥ 19.49 is false). The correct answer is indeed 25.
