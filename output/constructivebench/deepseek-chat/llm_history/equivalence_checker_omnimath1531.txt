Ground Truth Answer: fun _ => -4
Proposed Answer: fun a : ℝ => a * (a - 1) * (a + 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the least value of s = x1³ + x2³ + x3³ - 3x1x2x3 where x1, x2, x3 are roots of the cubic equation x³ - a x² + a x - a = 0.

2. For a cubic equation x³ + px² + qx + r = 0 with roots x1, x2, x3:
   - x1 + x2 + x3 = -p
   - x1x2 + x2x3 + x3x1 = q
   - x1x2x3 = -r
   - The expression s = x1³ + x2³ + x3³ - 3x1x2x3 can be rewritten using the identity:
     x1³ + x2³ + x3³ - 3x1x2x3 = (x1 + x2 + x3)³ - 3(x1 + x2 + x3)(x1x2 + x2x3 + x3x1)

3. For our equation x³ - a x² + a x - a = 0:
   - x1 + x2 + x3 = a
   - x1x2 + x2x3 + x3x1 = a
   - x1x2x3 = a
   - Therefore, s = a³ - 3*a*a = a³ - 3a² = a²(a - 3)

4. The ground truth answer claims s is always -4, while the proposed answer gives a function of a.

5. The proposed answer a*(a-1)*(a+1) = a³ - a is incorrect as it doesn't match our derivation. The ground truth answer -4 is also incorrect as it doesn't depend on a.

6. However, if we consider the minimal value of s = a²(a - 3) for a > 0, we find it's minimized at a = 2 with value -4. This suggests the ground truth answer might be giving the minimal possible value of s over all a > 0.
