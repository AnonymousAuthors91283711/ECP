Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 1), (6, 3, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b, c) | ∃ p : ℕ, Nat.Prime p ∧ (a = 1 ∧ b = 1 ∧ c = p - 2 ∨ a = 1 ∧ b = p - 2 ∧ c = 1 ∨ a = p - 2 ∧ b = 1 ∧ c = 1)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all triples (a,b,c) of positive integers where:
   - (a+b)⁴ is divisible by c
   - (b+c)⁴ is divisible by a
   - (c+a)⁴ is divisible by b
   - a+b+c is prime

2. Ground truth gives specific solutions: (1,1,1), (2,2,1), and (6,3,2)

3. Proposed answer gives a parametric form for solutions where two variables are 1 and the third is p-2 (where p is prime)

Now let's check if they match:
- (1,1,1): p=3 (prime), matches proposed form (a=1,b=1,c=1=3-2)
- (2,2,1): p=5 (prime), but doesn't fit proposed form (would require two variables to be 1)
- (6,3,2): p=11 (prime), doesn't fit proposed form

The proposed answer only captures the (1,1,1) case and similar permutations, but misses the other two cases in the ground truth. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
