Ground Truth Answer: 11
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n > 1 where:
   C(n,2)*(1/4)^2*(3/4)^(n-2) = C(n,3)*(1/4)^3*(3/4)^(n-3)

2. We can simplify the equation:
   C(n,2)*(3/4) = C(n,3)*(1/4)
   => [n(n-1)/2]*(3/4) = [n(n-1)(n-2)/6]*(1/4)
   => 9 = n-2
   => n = 11

3. The ground truth answer is indeed 11, as shown by the algebraic solution.

4. The proposed answer is 8, which doesn't satisfy the equation when we plug it in:
   C(8,2)*(1/4)^2*(3/4)^6 ≈ 0.3115
   C(8,3)*(1/4)^3*(3/4)^5 ≈ 0.2088
   These are not equal.
