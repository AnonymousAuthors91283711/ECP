Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: 1
To determine whether the proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer, we need to analyze the number of real solutions to the equation \( \arctan x = x^2 - 1.6 \).

1. **Behavior Analysis**:
   - The function \( f(x) = \arctan x \) is bounded between \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \) and \( \frac{\pi}{2} \), and is monotonically increasing.
   - The function \( g(x) = x^2 - 1.6 \) is a parabola opening upwards with its vertex at \( (0, -1.6) \).

2. **Intersection Points**:
   - For large \( |x| \), \( g(x) \) grows without bound, while \( f(x) \) approaches \( \pm\frac{\pi}{2} \). Thus, \( g(x) \) will intersect \( f(x) \) at least once for \( x > 0 \) and once for \( x < 0 \).
   - Near \( x = 0 \), \( f(0) = 0 \) and \( g(0) = -1.6 \). Since \( f(x) \) is increasing and \( g(x) \) is decreasing for \( x < 0 \) and increasing for \( x > 0 \), there will be exactly one intersection in each of the negative and positive regions.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The equation \( \arctan x = x^2 - 1.6 \) has exactly **2** real solutions (one positive and one negative).

The proposed answer (1) is incorrect, as the ground truth answer is 2.
