    P2015AMCA_4_answer x y = 3/2 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => if x > y then x / y else y / x
Proposed Answer: fun x y => if x = 4 * y then 3/2 else 0
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem gives us the condition x + y = 5*(x - y) with x,y > 0
2. Solving the equation: x + y = 5x - 5y → 6y = 4x → x = (3/2)y
3. The ground truth answer gives x/y = 3/2 when x > y (which is true here since 3/2 > 1)
4. The proposed answer only returns 3/2 when x = 4*y, which contradicts our derived condition x = (3/2)y
5. The proposed answer returns 0 in all other cases, which is incorrect since the function should return y/x when y > x

The proposed answer is incorrect both in its condition (x=4y vs x=(3/2)y) and in its handling of other cases.
