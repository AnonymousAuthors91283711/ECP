Ground Truth Answer: 1545
Proposed Answer: 505
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a unique 6-tuple of natural numbers (n₁ to n₆) where:
   - All nᵢ > 0
   - A complex sum of Fibonacci numbers equals a specific combination of Fib(nᵢ)
   - The sum n₁+n₂+...+n₆ equals some answer (1545 vs 505)

2. The ground truth answer is 1545, while the proposed answer is 505.

3. The difference between these numbers is significant (1545 vs 505), and they are not equivalent.

4. Without seeing the full derivation, but given the large discrepancy, it's clear these are different answers.

5. The problem involves Fibonacci identities and combinatorial sums, where 1545 is more likely to be correct given the complexity of the sum.
