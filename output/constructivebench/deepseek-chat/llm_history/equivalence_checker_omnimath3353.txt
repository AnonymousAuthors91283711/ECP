noncomputable abbrev omnimath3353_answer : ℂ := sorry
theorem omnimath3353 :
  2 * Complex.cos (Real.log 2009 * Complex.I) ^ 2 + Complex.I * Complex.sin (Real.log 4036081 * Complex.I) = omnimath3353_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 4036082 / 4036081
Proposed Answer: 1 + Complex.I * Real.log 2009
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves complex trigonometric functions with arguments involving logarithms and imaginary numbers.

2. The ground truth answer is a simple rational number: 4036082 / 4036081

3. The proposed answer is an expression involving both real and imaginary parts: 1 + Complex.I * Real.log 2009

Key observations:
- The ground truth is purely real (no imaginary component)
- The proposed answer has both real (1) and imaginary (log 2009) components
- 4036081 is 2009², which appears in the problem statement
- The ground truth answer is very close to 1 (≈ 1.0000002477), while the proposed answer's real part is exactly 1

The answers are fundamentally different in nature (one purely real, one complex) and their forms don't match. The proposed answer doesn't simplify to the ground truth.
