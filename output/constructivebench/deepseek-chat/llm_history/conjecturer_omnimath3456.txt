abbrev omnimath3456_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3456 :
  Real.sqrt (3 ^ 3 + 3 ^ 3 + 3 ^ 3) = omnimath3456_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: 3 * Real.sqrt 3. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 7, which is at "omnimath3456_answer " in "abbrev omnimath3456_answer : ℝ := 3 * Real.sqrt 3", there is an error: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.sqrt', and it does not have executable code.
. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to compute the square root of (3³ + 3³ + 3³). The expression simplifies to √(27 + 27 + 27) = √81 = 9. However, the error indicates we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves Real.sqrt.

The proposed answer 3 * √3 would be incorrect since √81 = 9. The error is about computability rather than correctness. We need to:
1. Provide the correct mathematical answer (9)
2. Mark it as noncomputable since it uses Real.sqrt

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev omnimath3456_answer : ℝ := 9>>>

Explanation:
1. Mathematically: 3³ + 3³ + 3³ = 27 + 27 + 27 = 81, and √81 = 9
2. The noncomputable annotation is needed because Real.sqrt is involved
3. The enumerated answers weren't provided, but the mathematical computation is straightforward
4. The original proposed answer (3 * √3) was incorrect for this problem
