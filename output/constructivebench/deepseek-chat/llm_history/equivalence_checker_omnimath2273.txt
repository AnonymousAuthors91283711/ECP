Ground Truth Answer: 73 / 1225
Proposed Answer: 1 / 13
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is calculating the probability that two randomly drawn cards from a modified deck have the same label. The deck has:
- 12 ranks with 4 cards each (total 48 cards)
- 1 rank with 2 cards (total 2 cards)
- Making 50 cards total

Ground truth calculation:
- Total pairs: C(50,2) = 1225
- Same-label pairs: 12*C(4,2) + C(2,2) = 12*6 + 1 = 73
- Probability: 73/1225

Proposed answer is 1/13, which would be the probability if:
- All ranks had equal numbers of cards
- But they don't - one rank has fewer cards

The proposed answer ignores the uneven distribution of cards across ranks, particularly the rank with only 2 cards. Therefore, it's incorrect.
