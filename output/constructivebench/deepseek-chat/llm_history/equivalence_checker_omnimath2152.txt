Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 2), (12, 17), (17, 12)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b) | ∃ k : ℕ, k > 0 ∧ (a = k ∧ b = k) ∨ (a = k ∧ b = 2 * k + 1) ∨ (a = 2 * k + 1 ∧ b = k)}
Let's analyze the proposed answer and compare it with the ground truth:

1. The ground truth gives three specific solutions: (2,2), (12,17), and (17,12).

2. The proposed answer gives a general form:
   - Case 1: a = b = k (which would include (2,2))
   - Case 2: a = k and b = 2k+1 (which would give (12,17) when k=12 since 2*12+1=25≠17)
   - Case 3: a = 2k+1 and b = k (which would give (17,12) when k=12 since 2*12+1=25≠17)

The problem is that the proposed answer doesn't correctly capture the (12,17) and (17,12) cases. For k=12, the proposed form would give (12,25) and (25,12), not (12,17) and (17,12). The general form doesn't match the ground truth solutions.
