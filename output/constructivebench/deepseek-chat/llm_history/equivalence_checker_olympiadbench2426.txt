Ground Truth Answer: 600 / 7
Proposed Answer: 80
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a scenario with:
   - Train interval: 3/60 hours (3 minutes)
   - Passing interval: 10/60 hours (10 minutes)
   - Linh's speed: 60 km/h
   - We need to find the unique speed v > 0 of the trains

2. The equation setup is correct:
   - Relative speed = v - 60
   - Train distance = v * (3/60)
   - Passing time = train distance / relative speed = 10/60

3. Solving the equation:
   (v * (3/60)) / (v - 60) = 10/60
   => 3v / (v - 60) = 10
   => 3v = 10v - 600
   => 7v = 600
   => v = 600/7 ≈ 85.714 km/h

4. The ground truth answer is 600/7 (exact value)
5. The proposed answer is 80 (which is incorrect)
