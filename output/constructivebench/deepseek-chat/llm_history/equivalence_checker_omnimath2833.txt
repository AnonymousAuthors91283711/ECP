Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => (2 * x + 3 * y) / (3 * x - 2 * y)
Proposed Answer: fun x y : ℝ => (2 * x + 3 * y) / (3 * x - 2 * y) - 17 / 11
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us an equation (x-y)/(x+y) = 5 and asks us to find some relationship between x and y.

2. The ground truth answer is a function (2x + 3y)/(3x - 2y).

3. The proposed answer is the same function minus 17/11.

From the problem statement, we're supposed to find when omnimath2833_answer x y = 0. The ground truth answer correctly represents the expression that equals zero under the given conditions (which can be derived by solving (x-y)/(x+y) = 5 to find x = -3/2 y, then substituting into the expression).

The proposed answer subtracts a constant 17/11, which would only equal zero in very specific cases, not generally under the given conditions. Therefore, the proposed answer is not equivalent to the ground truth answer.
