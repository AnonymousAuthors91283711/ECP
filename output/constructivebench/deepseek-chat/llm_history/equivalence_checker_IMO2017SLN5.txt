Ground Truth Answer: {(3, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(p, q) | p = q + 1 ∧ Nat.Prime p ∧ Nat.Prime q}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer suggests that the solution is all pairs of consecutive primes where p = q + 1. The ground truth answer specifically gives only (3,2) as the solution. While (3,2) does satisfy p = q + 1 with both primes, the proposed answer is more general and might include other pairs that don't actually satisfy the original equation. The problem likely only has (3,2) as its solution, making the proposed answer too broad. Therefore, the answers are not fully equivalent, but the proposed answer is partially correct as it includes the correct solution.
