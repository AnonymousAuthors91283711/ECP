Based on the problem statement and error message, I can see this is a probability problem involving counting functions where certain conditions hold. The error appears to be a syntax issue in the theorem statement. The proposed answer 1/6 seems plausible since we're dealing with uniform probability over functions from Fin 6 to Fin 6, and we're looking at the probability that a random element equals d 5.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<1 / 6>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem involves counting functions d: Fin 6 → Fin 6 where d i = d 5 for some i ∈ Fin 5
2. For any fixed d 5 value, the probability that d i equals d 5 is 1/6 (since Fin 6 has 6 elements)
3. The expected number of matches in the first 5 positions is 5 * (1/6) = 5/6
4. However, the theorem statement divides by 6^6 (total functions) and sums over all d, so we're effectively computing the average probability
5. The final probability simplifies to 1/6 since each position has equal probability of matching d 5[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
