Ground Truth Answer: fun x => x + 22
Proposed Answer: fun x => -4 * x + 12
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a linear function f(x) = a*x + b where:
   - a ≠ 0
   - f(x) - f⁻¹(x) = 44 for all x

2. For the ground truth answer f(x) = x + 22:
   - f⁻¹(x) = x - 22
   - f(x) - f⁻¹(x) = (x + 22) - (x - 22) = 44 ✓
   - a = 1 ≠ 0 ✓

3. For the proposed answer f(x) = -4x + 12:
   - f⁻¹(x) = (12 - x)/4
   - f(x) - f⁻¹(x) = (-4x + 12) - (3 - 0.25x) = -3.75x + 9 ≠ 44 ✗

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the condition f(x) - f⁻¹(x) = 44 for all x, while the ground truth does.
