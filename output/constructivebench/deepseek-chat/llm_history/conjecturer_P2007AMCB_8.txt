  (T : ℚ) / N = P2007AMCB_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<3 / 2>>> 

Explanation: The problem describes a relationship between T and N with constraints on c₁, c₂, c₃. The enumerated pattern suggests T/N = 1.5, which simplifies to 3/2 in ℚ. The conditions imply a linear relationship where T is 1.5 times N.
