Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer:  -4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have three equations:
   - x * y = 6
   - x - z = 2 ⇒ z = x - 2
   - x + y + z = 9

2. Substitute z = x - 2 into the third equation:
   x + y + (x - 2) = 9 ⇒ 2x + y = 11 ⇒ y = 11 - 2x

3. Substitute y into the first equation:
   x * (11 - 2x) = 6 ⇒ 11x - 2x² = 6 ⇒ 2x² - 11x + 6 = 0

4. Solve the quadratic equation:
   x = [11 ± √(121 - 48)]/4 = [11 ± √73]/4

5. Now evaluate the expression x/y - z/x - z²/(x*y):
   - After substituting y = 11 - 2x and z = x - 2, and simplifying, we find the expression always equals 2, regardless of which root we choose.

The ground truth answer is 2, while the proposed answer is -4. These are clearly different values.
