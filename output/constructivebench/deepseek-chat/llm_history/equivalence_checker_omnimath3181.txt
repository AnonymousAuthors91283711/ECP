Ground Truth Answer: 86
Proposed Answer: 104
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting the number of ordered triples (a, b, c) where:
   - a, b, c are powers of 3 from 3^1 to 3^8
   - a ≤ b ≤ c
   - All pairwise products are divisible by the third number (i.e., (a*b)%c=0, etc.)

2. The ground truth answer is 86, while the proposed answer is 104.

3. The difference (104-86=18) suggests the proposed answer might be counting some invalid cases or missing some constraints.

4. The key constraints are:
   - The divisibility conditions must hold for all three pairs
   - The ordering a ≤ b ≤ c must be maintained

5. The proposed answer of 104 is significantly higher than the correct count of 86, indicating it likely includes cases that violate the divisibility conditions or ordering.
