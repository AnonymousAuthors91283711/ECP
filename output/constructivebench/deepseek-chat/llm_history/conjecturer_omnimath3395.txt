Looking at the problem, we need to find the value of k where the slope between points p1 and p2 is zero. The slope formula is (y2-y1)/(x2-x1) = 0.

Given:
p1 = (3, 2k + 1)
p2 = (8, 4k - 5)

The slope condition becomes:
(4k - 5 - (2k + 1))/(8 - 3) = 0
=> (2k - 6)/5 = 0
=> 2k - 6 = 0
=> k = 3

The error in the original proposed answer (2/3) was incorrect - it didn't satisfy the equation. The correct solution is k=3.

For the Lean compilation error, we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real numbers.
