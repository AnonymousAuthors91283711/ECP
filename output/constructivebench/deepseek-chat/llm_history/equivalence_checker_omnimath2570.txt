Ground Truth Answer: 650
Proposed Answer: 825
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the sum of squares of the first 50 odd numbers (from 1 to 99) modulo 1000.

2. The ground truth answer is 650.

3. The proposed answer is 825.

4. To verify, let's calculate the sum mathematically:
   - Sum of squares of first n odd numbers = n(2n+1)(2n-1)/3
   - For n=50: 50*101*99/3 = 50*101*33 = 166650
   - 166650 mod 1000 = 650

5. The calculation shows the correct answer is indeed 650, not 825.

<<<False>>>
