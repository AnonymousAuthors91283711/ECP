Ground Truth Answer: {fun x : ℝ => x}
Proposed Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, f = fun x => x + c}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all real-valued functions f that satisfy two conditions:
   - f(x+1) = f(x) + 1 (additive condition)
   - f(x²) = (f(x))² (quadratic condition)

2. Ground truth answer: Only the identity function f(x) = x satisfies both conditions.

3. Proposed answer: All functions of the form f(x) = x + c for some constant c.

Analysis:
- The identity function f(x) = x clearly satisfies both conditions.
- For f(x) = x + c:
  - It satisfies f(x+1) = (x+1) + c = f(x) + 1
  - But f(x²) = x² + c, while (f(x))² = (x + c)² = x² + 2cx + c²
  - These are equal only when 2cx + c² - c = 0 for all x, which requires c=0

Therefore, the only function that satisfies both conditions is f(x) = x. The proposed answer incorrectly includes all constant shifts, when only c=0 works.
