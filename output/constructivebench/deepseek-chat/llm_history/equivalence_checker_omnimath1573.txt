Ground Truth Answer: {2 ^ a | a ≥ 0}
Proposed Answer: {k | ∃ d > 0, k = 2^(d - 1)}
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer {2^a | a ≥ 0} and the proposed answer {k | ∃ d > 0, k = 2^(d-1)}.

The ground truth answer includes all powers of 2 starting from 2^0 = 1:
{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...}

The proposed answer can be rewritten by setting d = a+1, which gives:
For d=1: 2^(1-1) = 1
For d=2: 2^(2-1) = 2
For d=3: 2^(3-1) = 4
etc.

This produces exactly the same set {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...}, just expressed differently.
