The error occurs because `X` is not recognized as the polynomial variable. In Lean's Mathlib, we need to use `Polynomial.X` instead of just `X`. The proposed answer is correct in structure but needs proper syntax for the polynomial variable.

Looking at the functional equation and the symmetry involved, cubic polynomials seem to be the right solution space since:
1. The equation involves terms like x³/(yz) which suggests degree 3 homogeneity
2. The condition must hold for all non-zero x,y,z satisfying 2xyz = x+y+z
3. The enumerated answers suggest polynomials of form aX³ + bX

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<{P : Polynomial ℝ | ∃ a b : ℝ, P = Polynomial.C a * (Polynomial.X)^3 + Polynomial.C b * Polynomial.X}>>>

Explanation:
1. The fixed answer uses `Polynomial.X` instead of `X`
2. Maintains the same structure of cubic polynomials with coefficients a and b
3. Wraps the polynomial expression in the set notation as required
4. The form captures all real cubic polynomials symmetric in the required way
