The error occurs because the proposed answer is trying to use variables `x` and `y` that are not in scope for the abbreviation. Since the answer should be a constant value (not depending on `x` and `y`), we need to compute it using the given constraints `hprod` and `hsum`.

From the problem, we know:
1. `x * y = 5` (hprod)
2. `x² + y² = 21` (hsum)

We can compute `x⁴ + y⁴` using the identity:
`x⁴ + y⁴ = (x² + y²)² - 2(xy)²`

Substituting the known values:
`= 21² - 2*(5)²`
`= 441 - 50`
`= 391`

Here's the corrected Lean answer:

<<<391>>>
