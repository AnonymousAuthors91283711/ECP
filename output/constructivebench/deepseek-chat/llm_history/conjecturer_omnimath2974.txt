Looking at the pattern in the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we can see that the expression simplifies to a constant value. The calculation involves steps between points P to V, with 6 parts creating 5 intervals. The expression (S - P) + (V - T) simplifies to 2*step, where step = (V - P)/7.
