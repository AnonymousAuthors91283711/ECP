theorem omnimath2164 (a c : ℝ) :
  (∀ b : ℝ, ∃ x y, a * x + b * y = c - 1 ∧ (a + 5) * x + (b + 3) * y = c + 1) ↔ c = omnimath2164_answer a := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a => (2 * a + 5) / 5
Proposed Answer: fun a : ℝ => (2 * a + 6) / (a + 5)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a condition on c (in terms of a) such that for every real b, there exist x,y satisfying both given linear equations.

2. The ground truth answer is c = (2a + 5)/5.

3. The proposed answer is c = (2a + 6)/(a + 5).

To check equivalence, let's test with specific values of a:

- When a = 0:
  Ground truth: c = (0 + 5)/5 = 1
  Proposed: c = (0 + 6)/(0 + 5) = 6/5 ≠ 1

- When a = 5:
  Ground truth: c = (10 + 5)/5 = 3
  Proposed: c = (10 + 6)/(5 + 5) = 16/10 = 1.6 ≠ 3

Since the answers give different results for the same inputs, they are not equivalent.
