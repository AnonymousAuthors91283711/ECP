theorem P2000AIMEI_15 :
  ∃ (original : List ℕ),
    original.length = 2000 ∧
    original.Nodup ∧
    (∀ n, 1 ≤ n → n ≤ 2000 → n ∈ original) ∧
    process original [] = List.range' 1 2000 1 ∧
    let pos := original.indexOf 1999
    pos = 2000 - P2000AIMEI_15_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we can observe that the position of 1999 in the original list follows a pattern related to powers of 2. The answer appears to be the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 2000.
