Ground Truth Answer: 2017
Proposed Answer: 4^7 - 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating a sum of terms where each term is d * 4^p, with d and p coming from parallel lists:
   - d: [1,0,2,0,1,2,1]
   - p: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]

2. Calculating the sum:
   1*4^0 + 0*4^1 + 2*4^2 + 0*4^3 + 1*4^4 + 2*4^5 + 1*4^6
   = 1 + 0 + 32 + 0 + 256 + 2048 + 4096
   = 1 + 32 + 256 + 2048 + 4096
   = 6433

3. The ground truth answer is 2017, which doesn't match our calculation.

4. The proposed answer is 4^7 - 1 = 16384 - 1 = 16383, which also doesn't match our calculation.

Both answers are incorrect, but they're incorrect in different ways. The proposed answer (4^7 - 1) is not equivalent to the ground truth answer (2017), nor does it match the actual calculation of the given expression.
