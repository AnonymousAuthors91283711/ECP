Based on the problem statement and error message, I notice:
1. The problem involves calculating a probability (successful outcomes divided by total outcomes)
2. The proposed answer 5/16 matches the ratio (5*4^4)/4^6 when simplified
3. The error appears to be syntax-related in the theorem statement

The correct answer should be the simplified form of the probability calculation. The error in the theorem statement can be fixed by properly structuring the let bindings and using proper syntax for the probability ratio.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<5 / 16>>>

Explanation:
The probability is calculated as (successful_outcomes)/(total_outcomes) = (5*4^4)/4^6. Simplifying this:
- 4^4/4^6 = 1/4^2 = 1/16
- Thus (5*4^4)/4^6 = 5*(1/16) = 5/16
The answer is in ℚ as required and matches the simplified form of the given probability calculation.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
