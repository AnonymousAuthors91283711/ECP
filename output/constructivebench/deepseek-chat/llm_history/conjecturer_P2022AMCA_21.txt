Explanation: The pattern suggests an alternating polynomial with decreasing exponents from 1011 to 1, matching the divisor condition for X^2022 + X^1011 + 1. The enumerated answers show this alternating pattern.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the pattern in the proposed answer and considering the problem statement (finding a divisor of X^2022 + X^1011 + 1), I can see that:
1. The polynomial should have degree 1011 (since 2022/2 = 1011)
2. The pattern alternates between positive and negative coefficients
3. The exponents decrease by 1 each term

The correct polynomial can be expressed as the sum of alternating terms from X^1011 down to X^0. In Lean, we can represent this using a sum over a range with alternating signs.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<∑ k in Finset.range 1012, (-1)^k * X^(1011 - k)>>>

This expression:
- Uses Finset.range 1012 to get indices from 0 to 1011
- Alternates signs using (-1)^k
- Decreases exponents from 1011 down to 0 using (1011 - k)
- Sums all terms to form the complete polynomial

The polynomial will be X^1011 - X^1010 + X^1009 - ... + X - 1, which matches the pattern needed to divide X^2022 + X^1011 + 1.
