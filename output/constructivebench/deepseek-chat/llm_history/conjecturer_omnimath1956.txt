Looking at the problem, it's asking for the count of numbers below 1,000,000 where the sum of proper divisors is at least the number itself. These are called "abundant numbers". From number theory, we know all multiples of 6 ≥ 12 are abundant. The largest multiple of 6 below 1,000,000 is 999,996, and (999,996 - 12)/6 + 1 = 166,662.
