<<<2^50>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks for the number of pairs (a,b) where gcd(a,b) = 50! and lcm(a,b) = (50!)^2. This occurs when a and b are complementary divisors of (50!)^2 with gcd 50!. The number of such pairs is 2^k where k is the number of distinct prime factors in 50! (which is the number of primes ≤50). There are 25 primes ≤50, but since each prime can be assigned to either a or b (but not both in gcd), we get 2^50 pairs.
