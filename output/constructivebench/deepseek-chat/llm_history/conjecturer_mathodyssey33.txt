theorem mathodyssey33 :
  {(a, b, c) : ℤ × ℤ × ℤ | a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ c > 0 ∧ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2005 ∧ a ≤ b ∧ b ≤ c}.ncard = mathodyssey33_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the problem, we need to count positive integer triples (a,b,c) with a ≤ b ≤ c where a² + b² + c² = 2005. The enumerated answers suggest there are exactly 6 such triples. The answer is simply this count.

<<<6>>>
