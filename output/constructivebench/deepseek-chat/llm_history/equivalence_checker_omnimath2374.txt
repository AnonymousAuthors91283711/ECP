Ground Truth Answer: 2 ^ 2013 - 6036
Proposed Answer: 2012 * 2^2011 + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recurrence relation:
   - Base cases: x₁ = 1, x₂ = 2
   - Recurrence: xₙ₊₂ = 2xₙ₊₁ - xₙ + 2ⁿ

2. The ground truth answer is 2²⁰¹³ - 6036

3. The proposed answer is 2012 * 2²⁰¹¹ + 1

Let's check if they're equivalent:
2²⁰¹³ - 6036 = 4 * 2²⁰¹¹ - 6036 ≈ 4 * 2²⁰¹¹
2012 * 2²⁰¹¹ + 1 ≈ 2012 * 2²⁰¹¹

These are clearly not equivalent (4 vs 2012 coefficient). We can verify with small values:
For n=3:
x₃ = 2x₂ - x₁ + 2¹ = 4 - 1 + 2 = 5
Ground truth: 2⁴ - 12 = 4
Proposed: 3 * 2² + 1 = 13
Neither matches, but the ground truth formula appears incorrect for n=3, while the proposed answer is even further off.

However, the correct solution should be xₙ = 2ⁿ⁺¹ - 2n, which gives:
For n=2012: 2²⁰¹³ - 4024
This matches neither answer, but the ground truth is closer (6036 vs 4024).
