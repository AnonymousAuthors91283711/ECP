From the problem, we're looking for numbers n where:
1. Number of divisors of 2n is 64 (which is 2^6)
2. Number of divisors of 5n is 60 (which is 2^2*3*5)
The pattern suggests n must be constructed from primes 2, 3, 5 to satisfy these conditions. The solution is the count of such numbers n ≤ 20000.
