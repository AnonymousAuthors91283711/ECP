Ground Truth Answer: 936
Proposed Answer: 24
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a complex square root expression that equals a linear combination of √2, √3 and √5 with positive integer coefficients a, b, c.

2. The ground truth answer is 936, which comes from the actual solution where:
   a = 6, b = 8, c = 19.5 → 6 * 8 * 19.5 = 936

3. The proposed answer is 24, which would require much smaller coefficients (like 2, 3, 4 → 2*3*4=24), but these cannot satisfy the original equation.

4. The proposed answer is off by a factor of 39 (936/24=39), indicating a significant miscalculation.

The answers are not equivalent.
