Ground Truth Answer: 40
Proposed Answer: 20 - (2010 - 201) + (2010 - (201 - 20))
Let's evaluate both the ground truth answer and the proposed answer step by step.

Ground Truth Answer: 40

Proposed Answer: 20 - (2010 - 201) + (2010 - (201 - 20))
Let's compute this:
1. (2010 - 201) = 1809
2. (201 - 20) = 181
3. (2010 - 181) = 1829
Now the expression becomes: 20 - 1809 + 1829
4. 20 - 1809 = -1789
5. -1789 + 1829 = 40

The proposed answer evaluates to 40, which matches the ground truth answer. The expressions are equivalent.
