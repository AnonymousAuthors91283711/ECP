Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => (72 + 32 * sqrt 2) / 7
Proposed Answer: fun x y : ℝ => 8 + 2 * x * y
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the greatest value of z = x² + xy + 2y² under the constraint x² - xy + 2y² = 8 with x, y > 0.

2. The ground truth answer (72 + 32√2)/7 is a constant value, which makes sense for a maximum value problem.

3. The proposed answer 8 + 2xy is expressed in terms of x and y, which doesn't match the form of a greatest value (which should be a constant).

4. Moreover, the proposed answer doesn't satisfy the constraint. If we substitute the constraint into the proposed answer, we don't get a consistent result.

5. The correct approach would involve using optimization techniques (like Lagrange multipliers) to find the maximum value, which leads to the ground truth answer.

The proposed answer is incorrect both in form and substance.
