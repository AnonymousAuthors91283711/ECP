Looking at the error and the problem statement, I notice that the set comprehension syntax in Lean is different from what was attempted. The proposed answer tried to use a pattern similar to mathematical notation, but Lean requires a different syntax for set construction.

The problem asks for all triples (x, y, p) where p is prime and p^x - y^p = 1. From the enumerated answers and mathematical reasoning:
1. (2,1,2) is a solution since 2² - 1² = 4-1=3 ≠1 (Wait, this seems incorrect - perhaps it should be (1,0,2) but that's not in ℕ)
2. (1,1,p) works for any prime p since p^1 - 1^p = p-1=1 ⇒ p=2, but this only works for p=2
3. Other solutions might include (x,0,p) but 0∉ℕ
4. The only valid solution appears to be (1,0,2) but 0∉ℕ

After reconsideration, the correct solution appears to be just the single case (1,0,2) but since y must be in ℕ (positive integers), there are actually no solutions. However, the enumerated answers suggest (2,1,2) and (1,1,p), but:
- For (2,1,2): 2²-1²=3≠1
- For (1,1,p): p-1=1 ⇒ p=2 only

Therefore, the correct answer should be just (1,1,2). Here's the corrected Lean syntax:

<<<({(1, 1, 2)} : Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ))>>>

Explanation:
The only solution in positive integers is (1,1,2) since:
1. For x=1: p - y^p = 1 ⇒ y=1 ⇒ p=2
2. For x>1: No solutions exist in positive integers as p^x grows much faster than y^p
The syntax uses explicit type annotation and proper set construction notation.
