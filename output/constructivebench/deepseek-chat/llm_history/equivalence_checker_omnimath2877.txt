abbrev omnimath2877_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2877
: (Real.sqrt (16 * Real.sqrt 16) = omnimath2877_answer) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2 ^ 3
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is evaluating √(16 * √16)
2. Let's compute step by step:
   - √16 = 4
   - 16 * √16 = 16 * 4 = 64
   - √64 = 8
3. The ground truth answer is 2³ which equals 8
4. The proposed answer is 8

The two answers are mathematically equivalent since 2³ = 8. The ground truth is just expressing the answer in exponential form while the proposed answer gives the simplified numerical value.
