abbrev omnimath3874_answer : Set (ℤ × ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3874 :
  {(a, b) : ℤ × ℤ | (b^2 + 7 * (a - b))^2 = a^3 * b} = omnimath3874_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ)
From the enumerated answers and pattern recognition, the solution set appears to be all integer pairs where either:
1. b = 0 (with a being any integer)
2. a = b (with b being any integer)
3. (0,7) and (7,0) as special cases

<<<{(a, b) | b = 0 ∨ a = b ∨ (a, b) = (0, 7) ∨ (a, b) = (7, 0)}>>>
