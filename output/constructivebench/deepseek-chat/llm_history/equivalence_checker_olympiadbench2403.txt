Ground Truth Answer: 23
Proposed Answer: 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives a family of quadratic polynomials fₙ(x) = x² + (2n-1)x + (n²-22)
2. We need to find natural numbers n > 0 where the polynomial has no real roots (i.e., discriminant < 0)
3. The discriminant D = (2n-1)² - 4(n²-22) = 4n²-4n+1-4n²+88 = -4n+89
4. For no real roots, we need D < 0 ⇒ -4n+89 < 0 ⇒ n > 89/4 ⇒ n > 22.25
5. Therefore, the smallest natural number satisfying this is n = 23

The ground truth answer (23) is correct, while the proposed answer (5) is incorrect since:
- For n=5: D = -4*5 + 89 = 69 > 0, so it has real roots
- The condition fails for n=5

<<<False>>>
