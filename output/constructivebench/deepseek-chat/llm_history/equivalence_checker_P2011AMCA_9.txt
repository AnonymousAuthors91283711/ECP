Ground Truth Answer: 441
Proposed Answer: 135
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer step by step.

1. The problem involves calculating handshakes between twins and triplets at a party. The ground truth answer is given as 441.

2. The proposed answer is 135, which is significantly smaller than the ground truth.

3. Let's compute the values based on the given formulas:
   - twins = 9 * 2 = 18
   - triplets = 6 * 3 = 18
   - twin_handshakes = 9 * (2 * (18 - 2) + 2 * (18 / 2)) = 9 * (32 + 18) = 9 * 50 = 450
   - triplet_handshakes = 6 * (3 * (18 - 3) + 3 * (18 / 2)) = 6 * (45 + 27) = 6 * 72 = 432
   - Total handshakes = (450 + 432) / 2 = 882 / 2 = 441

4. The calculation confirms the ground truth answer of 441 is correct, while the proposed answer of 135 is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
