From the given conditions:
1. p = q - 1
2. q = r - 1
3. r = s - 1
4. p + s = 109

We can express all variables in terms of s:
r = s - 1
q = (s - 1) - 1 = s - 2
p = (s - 2) - 1 = s - 3

Substituting into p + s = 109:
(s - 3) + s = 109 → 2s = 112 → s = 56

Then q + r = (s - 2) + (s - 1) = 2s - 3 = 2*56 - 3 = 109

<<<109>>>
