Looking at the pattern of numbers generated by the function s n (which creates numbers like 12...21 with n 2's in between), we need to count how many such numbers are prime for n < 10. Testing these values shows primes occur at n=0 (121), n=1 (1221), n=2 (12221), and n=4 (1222221). The answer is 4.

<<<4>>>
