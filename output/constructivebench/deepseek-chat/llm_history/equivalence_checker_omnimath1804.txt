Ground Truth Answer: 3970
Proposed Answer: (2^6 + 2^6 - 1)^2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting the number of 6×6 binary matrices that can be expressed as an outer product of two binary vectors (one for rows, one for columns).

2. The ground truth answer is 3970, which is a specific number.

3. The proposed answer is (2^6 + 2^6 - 1)^2 = (64 + 64 - 1)^2 = 127^2 = 16129.

4. The correct count should be (2^6 - 1)*(2^6 - 1) + 1 = 63*63 + 1 = 3970. This is because:
   - For non-zero vectors: (2^6-1) choices for rows × (2^6-1) choices for columns = 63×63 = 3969
   - Plus 1 case for the zero matrix (when both vectors are zero)

5. The proposed formula overcounts significantly (16129 vs 3970) because it incorrectly squares the sum rather than using the correct combinatorial counting.
