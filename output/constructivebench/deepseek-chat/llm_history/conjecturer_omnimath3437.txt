From the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we can deduce that we're looking for a natural number that is not expressible as 2*(a+b) where a,b are positive integers with a*b=24. The possible (a,b) pairs are (1,24), (2,12), (3,8), (4,6), (6,4), (8,3), (12,2), (24,1), giving p values of 50, 28, 22, 20. The smallest natural number not in this set is 19.
