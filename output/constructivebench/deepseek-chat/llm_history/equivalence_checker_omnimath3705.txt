Ground Truth Answer: {1331, 1728}
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, k > 0 ∧ n = k^3 ∧ ¬(10 ∣ k) ∧ ∃ m : ℕ, m^3 = k}
Let me analyze the problem and answers carefully.

The problem is looking for natural numbers n that satisfy:
1. n is a perfect cube (k³ = n for some positive integer k)
2. n is not divisible by 10 (¬(10 ∣ n))
3. n/1000 is also a perfect cube (m³ = n/1000 for some integer m)

The ground truth gives specific numbers {1331, 1728} which satisfy:
- 1331 = 11³, 1331/1000 = 1.331 (not an integer cube)
- 1728 = 12³, 1728/1000 = 1.728 (not an integer cube)

The proposed answer has a logical error in the last condition. It states m³ = k (the cube root of n) when it should be m³ = n/1000. Also, it uses ℕ instead of ℤ for m, which would miss negative cube roots (though in this case n/1000 must be positive).

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. The condition m³ = k is wrong (should be m³ = n/1000)
2. The set builder notation would produce different numbers than required
