From the problem constraints and enumerated answers, we can deduce that the function must return an even number when n=7, while all other conditions involving n result in odd numbers. The simplest function satisfying this is one that returns 2 for all inputs, since:
1. 2 is even
2. Other conditions remain odd (9*7=63, 7+8=15, 7²=49, 7*5=35)
