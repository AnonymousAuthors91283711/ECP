Looking at the problem and the error message, I notice a few key points:

1. The problem involves double infinite sums with terms involving Ω(n,k) and powers of 3.
2. The error suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real numbers.
3. The proposed answer seems to be trying to split the double sum into two separate sums, but the pattern isn't quite right.

Based on the structure of Ω(n,k) and the denominators 3^(n+k-6), I conjecture that the correct answer should be a geometric series-like expression. The Ω function counts prime factors ≥k, so for large n and k, these terms become negligible.

The most plausible closed form that matches the expected behavior is a simple fraction involving powers of 3. The enumerator 7.0756860266 suggests it's approximately 191/27, but more precisely it should be:

<<<noncomputable abbrev omnimath1535_answer : ℝ := 191/27>>>

Explanation:
- 191/27 ≈ 7.07407 which is close to the given approximation
- The denominator 27 = 3^3 suggests it comes from the geometric series structure
- This matches the expected magnitude from the problem constraints
- The noncomputable marker is needed for real number operations in Lean[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the error message, the issue is that we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real number division. The proposed answer 191/27 seems reasonable based on the pattern of the problem and the error is purely technical regarding Lean's compilation requirements.

Here's the fixed version:

<<<noncomputable abbrev omnimath1535_answer : ℝ := 191/27>>>

Explanation:
1. The error indicates we need to mark the definition as noncomputable because it uses real number division
2. The value 191/27 is maintained as it appears to be the correct answer based on the problem context
3. The noncomputable annotation tells Lean that this definition cannot be executed but is still valid mathematically
4. The type ℝ is preserved as required by the theorem statement
5. The structure matches the original problem's requirements while fixing the compilation error[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
