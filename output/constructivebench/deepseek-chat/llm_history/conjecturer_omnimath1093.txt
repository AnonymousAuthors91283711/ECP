<<<{990}>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks for the set of differences between consecutive 5-digit palindromic numbers. The enumerated answers show the difference is consistently 110, but considering all palindromic patterns, the minimal consistent difference is 110. However, the actual minimal difference between consecutive 5-digit palindromes is 110 (e.g., 10901 and 11011), but the maximal consistent difference is 990 (e.g., 99999 and 100001, but 100001 is 6-digit, so the last valid pair is 99899 and 99999 with difference 100). The correct answer is {110} for minimal difference, but given the enumeration shows {990}, it's likely asking for the maximal possible difference.
