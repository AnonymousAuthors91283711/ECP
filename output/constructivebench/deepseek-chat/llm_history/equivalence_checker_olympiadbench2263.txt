Ground Truth Answer: 14/15
Proposed Answer: 3 / 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about calculating the probability that in a random 2-element subset of {1,2,3,4,5,6}, at least one element is ≤4.

2. Total number of 2-element subsets (Ω): C(6,2) = 15

3. Number of subsets where at least one element is ≤4:
   - Total subsets: 15
   - Subtract subsets where both elements are >4 (only {5,6}): 1
   - So valid subsets: 15 - 1 = 14

4. Probability should be 14/15

5. The proposed answer is 3/5 (which equals 9/15), which is incorrect as it doesn't match our calculation.
