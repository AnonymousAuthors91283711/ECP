Explanation: The problem asks if there exists a positive coefficient vector where the polynomial has no real roots, but swapping any two coefficients introduces a real root. The answer is true since we can construct such coefficients (e.g., exponentially decreasing sequence a_i = 2^{-i}) where the original polynomial is always positive, but coefficient swaps create sign changes enabling roots.
