Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the ratio n/p given certain conditions about quadratic polynomials and their roots.

2. The conditions state that:
   - The first polynomial X² + pX + m has roots {r, s}
   - The second polynomial X² + mX + n has roots {2r, 2s}

3. From Vieta's formulas:
   For first polynomial: r + s = -p and rs = m
   For second polynomial: 2r + 2s = -m and (2r)(2s) = n ⇒ 4rs = n

4. From the first equation: 2(r+s) = 2(-p) = -m ⇒ m = 2p
5. From rs = m and 4rs = n ⇒ n = 4m = 4(2p) = 8p
6. Therefore n/p = 8

The ground truth answer is 8, which matches our derivation. The proposed answer is 4, which is incorrect as it seems to have missed the factor of 2 from the relationship between m and p.
