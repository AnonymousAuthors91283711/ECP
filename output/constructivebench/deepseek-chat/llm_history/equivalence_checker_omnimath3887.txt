: IsLeast {α : ℝ | α > 0 ∧ ∀ x > 0, ∀ y > 0, (x + y) / 2 ≥ α * Real.sqrt (x * y) + (1 - α) * Real.sqrt ((x ^ 2 + y ^ 2) / 2)} omnimath3887_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1 / 2
Proposed Answer: Real.sqrt 2 / (1 + Real.sqrt 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest lower bound (infimum) of all α > 0 that satisfy the given inequality for all x,y > 0.

2. The inequality is a weighted combination of the arithmetic mean (AM) and root mean square (RMS) compared to the geometric mean (GM).

3. The ground truth answer is 1/2 ≈ 0.5.

4. The proposed answer is √2/(1+√2) ≈ 0.5858.

5. These are clearly different numerical values (0.5 vs 0.5858).

6. To verify which is correct, we can test extreme cases:
   - When x = y, both answers satisfy the inequality
   - When x approaches 0 while y is fixed, the ground truth 1/2 maintains the inequality, while the proposed answer fails to satisfy it for sufficiently small x/y ratios.

Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect.
