theorem olympiadbench2247 :
  IsGreatest {z : ℝ | ∃ x y, 2 ≤ x ∧ x ≤ 5 ∧ 10 ≤ y ∧ y ≤ 20 ∧ z = olympiadbench2247_answer (x, y)} 13 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ × ℝ → ℝ
From the problem statement and the given IsGreatest condition with value 13, we can deduce that the function should reach its maximum value of 13 within the given bounds. The most likely answer is a linear combination of x and y that achieves this maximum at the boundary points. Looking at the constraints (x ∈ [2,5], y ∈ [10,20]), the simplest form would be y - x, which reaches 13 at (x,y) = (2,15) or (5,18).
