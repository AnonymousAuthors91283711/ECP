Ground Truth Answer: {fun x => 0, fun x => x - 1}
Proposed Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, f = fun x => if x = 0 then 0 else if x = 1 then c else c * (x - 1)} ∪ {f : ℝ → ℝ | f = fun _ => 0} ∪ {f : ℝ → ℝ | f = fun x => x - 1}
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground Truth: {fun x => 0, fun x => x - 1}
Proposed Answer: A union of three sets:
1. Functions that are 0 at x=0, some constant c at x=1, and c*(x-1) elsewhere
2. The zero function
3. The function x ↦ x-1

Key observations:
1. The zero function is included in both answers.
2. The function x ↦ x-1 is included in both answers.
3. The first set in the proposed answer includes many more functions than just these two, parameterized by c.

However, if we test these additional functions from the proposed answer in the original functional equation f(x*y) = f(x)*f(y) + f(f(x+y)):
- For c ≠ 0 and c ≠ 1, these functions don't satisfy the original equation.
- Only when c=0 (which gives the zero function) or when the function is exactly x ↦ x-1 do they work.

Therefore, the proposed answer includes many incorrect solutions, making it not equivalent to the ground truth.
