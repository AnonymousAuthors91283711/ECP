Ground Truth Answer: 16
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves complex numbers and exponents, specifically (Complex.ofReal (-1) + i)^k where i is the imaginary unit.

2. The equation is set equal to Complex.ofReal (1/2^T) where T = -8, meaning the right side is Complex.ofReal (1/2^(-8)) = Complex.ofReal(256).

3. The left side (-1 + i)^k can be rewritten in polar form:
   - The magnitude is √((-1)² + 1²) = √2
   - The angle is 3π/4 (135 degrees)
   - So (-1 + i)^k = (√2)^k * (cos(3πk/4) + i sin(3πk/4))

4. For this to be purely real (256), the imaginary part must be 0 and the real part must be 256:
   - sin(3πk/4) = 0 ⇒ 3πk/4 must be a multiple of π ⇒ k must be multiples of 4/3
   - Since k is natural, smallest k where both conditions hold is when k=16:
     * (√2)^16 = 256
     * 3π*16/4 = 12π ⇒ sin(12π) = 0 and cos(12π) = 1

The proposed answer is 8, but:
- For k=8: (√2)^8 = 16 (not 256)
- The angle condition would work (3π*8/4 = 6π ⇒ sin(6π)=0), but the magnitude is wrong
