Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 3 * n^2 - 5 * n + 2
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (n - 1)^2 * 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of adjacent black-white pairs in an n×n grid where adjacency is defined as being within 1 unit in both coordinates (8-directional adjacency).

2. The ground truth answer is 3n² - 5n + 2, which comes from:
   - For large n, the optimal configuration is a checkerboard pattern
   - Each white square in the bulk has 4 black neighbors (but edge/corner squares have fewer)
   - The formula accounts for these edge effects

3. The proposed answer is (n-1)² * 4, which would be:
   - (n-1)² suggests it's counting interior points only
   - *4 suggests it assumes each has 4 neighbors
   - But this ignores that:
     a) Edge squares have fewer neighbors
     b) The optimal count includes some edge/corner squares

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It overcounts by assuming all squares have 4 neighbors
- It doesn't match the ground truth formula
- For n=3: ground truth gives 14, proposed gives 16
- For n=4: ground truth gives 30, proposed gives 36
