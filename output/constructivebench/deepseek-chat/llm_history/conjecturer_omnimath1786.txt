theorem omnimath1786
    (P : ℕ → ℕ → Prop)
    (hP : ∀ a b, P a b ↔ a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ a ≠ b ∧ (if a < b then (a - 20) * (b + 23) = a * b else (b - 20) * (a + 23) = a * b)) :
    IsLeast {s | ∃ a b, P a b ∧ s = a + b} omnimath1786_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the problem statement and the condition (a-20)(b+23) = a*b when a < b, we can deduce that the minimal sum occurs when a and b are consecutive numbers. The enumerated answers suggest the minimal sum is 529. This comes from solving the equation for a = b - 1.
