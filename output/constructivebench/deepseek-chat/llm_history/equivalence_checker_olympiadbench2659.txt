theorem olympiadbench2659 : 
  (10^(9^2 - 9))^(1/9)^(1/2)^(1/2) = olympiadbench2659_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 100
Proposed Answer: 10^(9^(2 - 9^(1/2)^(1/2))/9^(1/2)^(1/2))
Let's analyze both answers step by step.

1. Ground Truth Answer (100):
- The expression simplifies as follows:
  (10^(9^2 - 9))^(1/9)^(1/2)^(1/2) = (10^(81-9))^(1/9)^(1/4) = (10^72)^(1/9)^(1/4) = 10^(72/9)^(1/4) = 10^8^(1/4) = 10^2 = 100

2. Proposed Answer:
- The structure is completely different and doesn't match the simplification steps
- The exponents are nested incorrectly
- The final form doesn't evaluate to 100

The proposed answer is not equivalent to the ground truth answer. The simplification steps and final result are incorrect.
