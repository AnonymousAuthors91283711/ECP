Looking at the problem and error message, I notice several issues:
1. The rates are being calculated using integer division (/) which truncates results in Lean
2. The rates should be calculated using exact fractions or floating point
3. The syntax needs proper line breaks or semicolons between let statements

The problem appears to be calculating combined work rates where:
- Dennis takes 48 minutes (rate = 60/48 pages/hour)
- Edward takes 48 minutes (rate = 60/48 pages/hour) 
- Shawn takes 24 minutes (rate = 60/24 pages/hour)
Total rate is sum of individual rates multiplied by 2 hours.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<
let dennis_rate := 60 / 48;
let edward_rate := 60 / 48;
let shawn_rate := 60 / 24;
let total_rate := dennis_rate + edward_rate + shawn_rate;
total_rate * 2
>>>

Explanation:
1. Fixed syntax by adding semicolons between let statements
2. Kept integer division as problem expects ℕ result
3. The calculation follows the work rate formula where:
   - Each person's rate is (60 minutes)/(their time in minutes)
   - Total work done in 2 hours is sum of rates × 2
4. Numerically: (60/48=1) + (60/48=1) + (60/24=2) = 4, then 4×2=8[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem, we need to calculate the combined work rate of Dennis, Edward, and Shawn, then multiply by 2 hours. The error in the proposed answer comes from using semicolons (;) instead of commas (,) in the let expressions and missing proper Lean syntax.

The rates are:
- Dennis: 60 problems/48 minutes = 5/4 problems per minute
- Edward: same as Dennis (60/48 = 5/4)
- Shawn: 60 problems/24 minutes = 5/2 problems per minute

Total rate is 5/4 + 5/4 + 5/2 = 5 problems per minute. Multiplying by 2 hours (120 minutes) gives 600 problems.

Here's the corrected Lean expression:

<<<(60 / 48 + 60 / 48 + 60 / 24) * 120>>> 

Explanation:
1. Used proper Lean syntax with parentheses and + operators
2. Calculated each rate directly in the expression
3. Multiplied by 120 minutes (2 hours) instead of 2
4. The expression evaluates to 600, matching the expected answer type ℕ[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem and error message, I notice several issues:

1. The proposed answer has syntax errors - the expressions need proper line breaks or semicolons between let bindings
2. The rates should be calculated using exact division (/) rather than integer division (which Lean uses by default for Nat)
3. The final multiplication should be by 2 (as in the theorem statement) not 120

The correct answer should calculate the total work rate in minutes and multiply by 2 hours (120 minutes). Here's the fixed version:

<<<
let dennis_rate := 60 / 48;
let edward_rate := 60 / 48;
let shawn_rate := 60 / 24;
let total_rate := dennis_rate + edward_rate + shawn_rate;
total_rate * 120
>>>

Explanation:
1. Each rate is calculated as 60 minutes divided by their individual times (48, 48, 24 minutes respectively)
2. The rates are summed to get total_rate
3. Multiplied by 120 minutes (2 hours) to get total work done
4. Used semicolons to properly separate the let bindings

The answer matches the problem's requirement to calculate based on given rates and 2 hours of work. The enumerated answers weren't provided, but this follows logically from the problem statement.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem and the error message, I notice several issues:

1. The error indicates syntax problems with line breaks/semicolons in the let expressions
2. The proposed answer multiplies by 120 at the end, but the theorem states it should multiply by 2
3. The rates should be calculated using exact division (/) rather than integer division (which Lean would do by default for ℕ)

Here's the corrected version that:
- Uses proper Lean syntax with line breaks
- Follows the theorem's specification of multiplying by 2
- Uses exact division (though we'd need to adjust types if we want exact results)

<<<
let dennis_rate := 60 / 48;
let edward_rate := 60 / 48;
let shawn_rate := 60 / 24;
let total_rate := dennis_rate + edward_rate + shawn_rate;
total_rate * 2
>>>

Explanation:
The problem appears to be about calculating combined work rates. The original answer had a syntax error from missing line breaks/semicolons and used 120 instead of 2 as the multiplier. The rates are calculated as:
- Dennis: 60/48 = 1.25 units/min
- Edward: 60/48 = 1.25 units/min 
- Shawn: 60/24 = 2.5 units/min
Total rate = 1.25 + 1.25 + 2.5 = 5 units/min
Final answer should be total_rate * 2 = 10 (as per theorem statement)
