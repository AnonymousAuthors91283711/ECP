abbrev omnimath3149_answer : ℕ × ℕ → ℕ × ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3149 : 
  omnimath3149_answer (3, 1) (4, 2) = 14 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun (a, b) (c, d) => a * c + b * d
Proposed Answer: fun (a b : ℕ × ℕ) => a.1 * b.2 + a.2 * b.1
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem asks for a function that takes two pairs of natural numbers and returns a natural number, with the example showing omnimath3149_answer (3,1) (4,2) = 14.

2. Ground truth: a*c + b*d (which gives 3*4 + 1*2 = 12 + 2 = 14)
3. Proposed answer: a.1*b.2 + a.2*b.1 (which gives 3*2 + 1*4 = 6 + 4 = 10 ≠ 14)

The proposed answer swaps the multiplication terms (multiplies first element of first pair with second element of second pair, and vice versa), which gives a different result than required.
