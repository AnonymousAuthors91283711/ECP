Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 2 * n - 1
Proposed Answer: fun n => n * (n - 1) / 2 + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum size of a special combinatorial structure (a set system with specific intersection properties).

2. The ground truth answer suggests a linear relationship: 2n - 1.

3. The proposed answer suggests a quadratic relationship: n(n-1)/2 + 1.

For n=2:
- Ground truth: 2*2-1 = 3
- Proposed: 2*1/2+1 = 2 (incorrect)

For n=3:
- Ground truth: 5
- Proposed: 4 (incorrect)

For n=4:
- Ground truth: 7
- Proposed: 7 (matches)

For n=5:
- Ground truth: 9
- Proposed: 11 (incorrect)

The answers only match at n=4 but diverge elsewhere. The proposed answer grows quadratically while the ground truth grows linearly. They are not equivalent.
