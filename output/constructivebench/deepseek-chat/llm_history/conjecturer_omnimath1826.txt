Looking at the problem and errors, we need to fix several issues:
1. The imaginary unit `i` needs to be properly represented in Lean (as `Complex.I`)
2. The square roots need to be properly typed as complex numbers
3. The set construction needs proper type annotations

The polynomial z^5 - 5z^4 + 11z^3 - 13z^2 + 9z - 3 factors as (z-1)^3(z^2-2z+3), giving roots at:
- z=1 (triple root)
- z=1±√2 (from z^2-2z-1=0)
- z=1±i√2 (from z^2-2z+3=0)

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<{1, (1 : ℂ) + Real.sqrt 2, (1 : ℂ) - Real.sqrt 2, (1 : ℂ) + Complex.I * Real.sqrt 2, (1 : ℂ) - Complex.I * Real.sqrt 2}>>>

Explanation:
1. Added explicit type annotations `(1 : ℂ)` to ensure all terms are complex numbers
2. Used `Real.sqrt` for the square roots (though in ℂ, this is fine for positive reals)
3. Represented imaginary unit properly as `Complex.I`
4. Included all roots from the polynomial factorization
5. The set now properly contains all complex roots of the given polynomial
