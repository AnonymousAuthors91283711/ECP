Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 4, 6, 16)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1, 6, 10), (1, 2, 5, 10), (1, 4, 5, 6)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all quadruples (a,b,c,d) where a≤b≤c≤d and the set {ab+cd, ac+bd, ad+bc} equals {40, 70, 100}.

2. Ground truth answer gives only (1,4,6,16):
   - ab+cd = 1*4 + 6*16 = 4+96 = 100
   - ac+bd = 1*6 + 4*16 = 6+64 = 70
   - ad+bc = 1*16 + 4*6 = 16+24 = 40
   This satisfies the condition.

3. Proposed answer gives 3 solutions:
   - (1,1,6,10):
     ab+cd = 1+60 = 61 ≠ any required
     Already fails
   - (1,2,5,10):
     ab+cd = 2+50 = 52 ≠ any required
     Fails
   - (1,4,5,6):
     ab+cd = 4+30 = 34 ≠ any required
     Fails

None of the proposed solutions satisfy the condition, while the ground truth does.
