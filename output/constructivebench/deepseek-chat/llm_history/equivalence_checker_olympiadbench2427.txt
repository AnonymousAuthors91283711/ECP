Ground Truth Answer: {(22 + 8 * sqrt 6, 22 - 8 * sqrt 6), (22 - 8 * sqrt 6, 22 + 8 * sqrt 6)}
Proposed Answer: {(100, 36), (36, 100)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives two conditions:
   - √a + √b = 8
   - log₁₀a + log₁₀b = 2 (which implies log₁₀(ab) = 2, so ab = 100)

2. The ground truth answer shows pairs where:
   - The sum of the numbers is 44 (22+8√6 + 22-8√6 = 44)
   - The product is 100 (22² - (8√6)² = 484 - 384 = 100)

3. The proposed answer shows pairs (100,36) and (36,100):
   - √100 + √36 = 10 + 6 = 16 ≠ 8 (fails first condition)
   - 100*36 = 3600 ≠ 100 (fails second condition)

The proposed answer completely fails to satisfy either of the given conditions, while the ground truth answer satisfies both.
