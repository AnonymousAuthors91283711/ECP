  ∃ (k : ℕ), 3 + 11 * k = omnimath2942_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<14>>> 

Explanation: The equation 3 + 11*k = answer needs to be satisfied. From enumeration, the smallest solution is when k=1, giving answer=14. This matches the pattern where the answer is the smallest positive integer satisfying the equation.
