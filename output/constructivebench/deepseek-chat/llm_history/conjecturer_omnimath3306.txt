theorem omnimath3306 :
  {s : Fin 5 → ℤ | (∀ i : Fin 5, s i ≤ 1) ∧ (∀ n : Fin 5, ∑ i : Fin (n + 1), s i ≥ 0)}.encard = omnimath3306_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the constraints:
1. Each s i ≤ 1
2. Partial sums must be ≥ 0
3. Sequence length is 5

This counts lattice paths staying above y=0 with steps ±1 (Dyck-like paths). For length 5, the number of valid sequences is 14 (Catalan numbers for even lengths, but 5 is odd).
