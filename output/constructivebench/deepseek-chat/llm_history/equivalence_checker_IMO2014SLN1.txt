Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n - 2) * 2^n + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (2^n - 1) * (2^(n - 1) - 1)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer is: (n - 2) * 2^n + 1
The proposed answer is: (2^n - 1) * (2^(n - 1) - 1)

Let's expand the proposed answer:
(2^n - 1)(2^{n-1} - 1) = 2^n * 2^{n-1} - 2^n - 2^{n-1} + 1
= 2^{2n-1} - 2^n - 2^{n-1} + 1

Now let's compare with ground truth:
(n-2)*2^n + 1 = n*2^n - 2^{n+1} + 1

These are clearly different expressions. For example, when n=2:
Ground truth: (2-2)*2^2 + 1 = 1
Proposed answer: (4-1)*(2-1) = 3*1 = 3

They give different results, so they are not equivalent.
