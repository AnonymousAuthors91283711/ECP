Ground Truth Answer: fun c => fun x => x^c
Proposed Answer: fun c : ℝ => fun x : ℝ => if x > 1 then x^c else 1
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. The ground truth answer is a simple power function `x^c` defined for all real x.
2. The proposed answer is a piecewise function that equals `x^c` when `x > 1` and equals `1` otherwise.

The problem specifies that the function's behavior is only constrained for `x > 1` (via `hdom`), and the theorem's conditions only apply when `x > 1` and `y > 1`. 

For the domain where the problem makes constraints (x > 1), both answers are identical (`x^c`). The proposed answer adds an arbitrary definition for x ≤ 1, but since the problem doesn't constrain the function's behavior in this domain, this doesn't affect the logical equivalence.

The proposed answer is therefore equivalent to the ground truth answer for the purposes of this problem, since:
1. They match on the constrained domain (x > 1)
2. The behavior on x ≤ 1 is irrelevant to the problem's conditions
