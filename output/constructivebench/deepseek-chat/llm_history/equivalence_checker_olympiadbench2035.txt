Ground Truth Answer: 8 / (7 ^ (1/3))
Proposed Answer: 4 * (100 / (100 + 28))^(1/3)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the maximum value of a cyclic sum of fractional cube roots under the constraint that a + b + c + d = 100 with all variables non-negative.

2. The ground truth answer is 8/(7^(1/3)), which simplifies to approximately 4.308 when calculated.

3. The proposed answer is 4*(100/(100+28))^(1/3), which simplifies to 4*(100/128)^(1/3) ≈ 4*0.925 ≈ 3.7.

Key observations:
- The ground truth answer is larger than the proposed answer
- The proposed answer seems to assume an equal distribution of variables (a=b=c=d=25), but this doesn't yield the maximum
- The maximum actually occurs when variables are maximally unequal (e.g., a=100, b=c=d=0)

The answers are not equivalent, and the proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't give the true maximum.
