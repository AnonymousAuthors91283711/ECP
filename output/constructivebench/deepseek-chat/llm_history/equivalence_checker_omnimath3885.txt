Ground Truth Answer: { fun _ => 0, fun x => x + 1 }
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℤ, f = fun x => c * x}
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem is asking for all integer functions f: ℤ → ℤ that satisfy the functional equation:
   f^(a² + b²)(a + b) = a*f(a) + b*f(b) for all integers a, b

2. The ground truth gives two solutions:
   - The zero function (f(x) = 0)
   - The successor function (f(x) = x + 1)

3. The proposed answer suggests all linear functions (f(x) = c*x)

Analysis:
- The zero function is included in both answers (c=0 case in proposed)
- The successor function is not linear (x+1 is affine, not purely linear)
- Testing the successor function: It satisfies the original equation
- Testing linear functions f(x) = c*x:
  - For c=1: f^(n)(x) = x + n, which doesn't satisfy the original equation
  - Only c=0 works among linear functions

The proposed answer is missing the successor function and incorrectly includes non-zero linear functions.
