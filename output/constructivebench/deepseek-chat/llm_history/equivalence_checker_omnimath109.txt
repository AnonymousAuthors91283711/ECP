Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ (a : ℝ), (∀ x y, f x y = a + min x y) ∨ (∀ x y, f x y = a + max x y)}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c, f = fun x y => max x y + c} ∪ {f | ∃ c, f = fun x y => min x y + c}
<<<True>>>

The ground truth answer states that the function f can be either of the form f(x,y) = a + min(x,y) or f(x,y) = a + max(x,y) for some constant a. The proposed answer expresses exactly the same thing, just using set union notation and slightly different variable naming (c instead of a). Both answers correctly capture all functions that satisfy the given conditions, with identical forms for the functions. The union of two sets in the proposed answer corresponds exactly to the disjunction (∨) in the ground truth answer.
