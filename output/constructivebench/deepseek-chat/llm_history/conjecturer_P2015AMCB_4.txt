theorem P2015AMCB_4 
  (L M R A N Rh : Fin 12)    (h₁ : N.val + 6 = M.val)    (h₂ : A.val = R.val + 1)    (h₃ : L.val = M.val + 2)    (h₄ : R.val = Rh.val + 2)    (h₅ : Rh.val = N.val + 1)    (h₆ : A.val = 5)    : M = P2015AMCB_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Fin 12
From the constraints, we can derive the relationships step by step:
1. From h₆: A = 5
2. From h₂: R = A - 1 = 4
3. From h₄: Rh = R - 2 = 2
4. From h₅: N = Rh - 1 = 1
5. From h₁: M = N + 6 = 7
6. From h₃: L = M + 2 = 9

The question asks for M, which we've calculated to be 7.
