abbrev omnimath2329_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2329 :
  {p : ℕ | Nat.Prime p ∧ ∃! a ∈ Icc 1 p, (a ^ 3 - 3 * a + 1) % p = 0} = omnimath2329_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {3}
Proposed Answer: {p : ℕ | Nat.Prime p ∧ p % 3 = 2}
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem asks for prime numbers p where the cubic equation x³ - 3x + 1 ≡ 0 mod p has exactly one solution in the interval [1,p].

2. The ground truth answer is {3}, meaning only the prime number 3 satisfies this condition.

3. The proposed answer claims it's all primes congruent to 2 mod 3.

4. Testing p=2 (which is ≡2 mod3):
   - Equation becomes x³ - 3x + 1 ≡ x³ + x + 1 ≡ 0 mod2
   - Testing x=0:1≡1≠0
   - Testing x=1:1+1+1≡1≠0
   - No solutions, so doesn't satisfy the condition (needs exactly one solution)

5. Testing p=5 (≡2 mod3):
   - Testing x=1:1-3+1≡-1≡4≠0
   - Testing x=2:8-6+1≡3≠0
   - Testing x=3:27-9+1≡19≡4≠0
   - Testing x=4:64-12+1≡53≡3≠0
   - No solutions

6. Only p=3 works:
   - Equation becomes x³ ≡ 0 mod3
   - Only x=0 is solution, but since interval is [1,3], we check:
   - x=1:1-3+1≡-1≡2≠0
   - x=2:8-6+1≡3≡0
   - x=3:27-9+1≡19≡1≠0
   - Exactly one solution (x=2)

The proposed answer is incorrect as it includes many primes that don't satisfy the condition, while missing the only correct answer (3).
