Explanation: The problem counts numbers coprime to 2015 in [1,2016], which is Euler's totient function φ(2015). The denominator is 2016. The answer simplifies to φ(2015)/2016 since 2015=5×13×31 and φ is multiplicative.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The problem involves calculating the probability that a randomly chosen number from 1 to 2016 is coprime with 2015. The proposed answer φ(2015)/2016 is conceptually correct but has type issues in Lean.

Key observations:
1. φ(2015) is Euler's totient function, which counts numbers coprime to 2015
2. 2015 factors into 5 × 13 × 31
3. The probability should be φ(2015)/2016 as a rational number

The errors occur because:
1. φ returns a Nat but we need ℚ
2. Division needs explicit casting in Lean

Here's the fixed version that:
1. Casts φ(2015) to ℚ using ↑
2. Uses proper Lean division syntax
3. Maintains the correct mathematical meaning

<<<↑(φ 2015) / ↑2016>>>

Explanation:
- ↑ is the coercion operator converting Nat to ℚ
- φ 2015 computes Euler's totient for 2015
- / operates on ℚ numbers after coercion
- The answer represents the exact probability as a rational number
