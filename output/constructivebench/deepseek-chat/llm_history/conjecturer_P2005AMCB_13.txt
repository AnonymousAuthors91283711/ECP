Looking at the problem statement and the error, I notice that the factorial operator (!) in Lean needs to be applied to Nat values, not Real numbers. The proposed answer uses factorial division which needs to be properly expressed in Lean.

The problem involves solving for xₙ in the equation (4+n)^(xₙ) = 5+n and then taking the product of xₙ from n=0 to 123. Taking logs gives xₙ = log(5+n)/log(4+n). The product becomes a telescoping series of logs.

The correct answer should be the ratio of logarithms of falling factorials, but expressed using Nat.factorial since we're dealing with integer arguments. Here's the corrected version:

<<<Real.log (Nat.factorial 128 / Nat.factorial 4) / Real.log (Nat.factorial 127 / Nat.factorial 3)>>>

Explanation:
1. The original expression had syntax issues with factorial application
2. We need to use Nat.factorial for integer arguments
3. The division inside logs needs to be explicit
4. The structure remains the same as it correctly captures the telescoping product of log ratios
5. The answer represents the product of xₙ = log(5+n)/log(4+n) from n=0 to 123
