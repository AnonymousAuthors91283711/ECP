Ground Truth Answer: {x : ℝ | ∃ k : ℤ, x = (1 : ℝ)/6 * Real.pi + Real.pi * k ∨ x = (1 : ℝ)/3 * Real.pi + Real.pi * k ∨ x = (2 : ℝ)/3 * Real.pi + Real.pi * k ∨ x = (5 : ℝ)/6 * Real.pi + Real.pi * k}
Proposed Answer: {x | ∃ k : ℤ, x = k * Real.pi / 2 + Real.pi / 6 ∨ x = k * Real.pi / 2 + Real.pi / 3}
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer gives four solution families:
1. π/6 + kπ
2. π/3 + kπ
3. 2π/3 + kπ
4. 5π/6 + kπ

The proposed answer gives two solution families:
1. kπ/2 + π/6
2. kπ/2 + π/3

Let's compare the solutions:
1. For k=0: π/6 and π/3 (matches ground truth)
2. For k=1: π/2+π/6=2π/3 and π/2+π/3=5π/6 (matches ground truth)
3. For k=2: π+π/6=7π/6 and π+π/3=4π/3 (not in ground truth)
4. For k=-1: -π/2+π/6=-π/3 and -π/2+π/3=-π/6 (not in ground truth)

The proposed answer generates additional solutions not present in the ground truth, and misses some solutions (like π/3 + kπ for odd k). The periodicity patterns are different.
