abbrev omnimath2942_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2942 : 
  ∃ (k : ℕ), 3 + 11 * k = omnimath2942_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 113
Proposed Answer: 14
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem is asking to find a natural number k such that 3 + 11*k equals some answer (omnimath2942_answer).

2. Ground truth answer is 113:
   - 113 - 3 = 110
   - 110 / 11 = 10
   - So k=10 works since 3 + 11*10 = 113

3. Proposed answer is 14:
   - 14 - 3 = 11
   - 11 / 11 = 1
   - So k=1 works since 3 + 11*1 = 14

Both answers satisfy the equation 3 + 11*k = answer for some natural number k. The ground truth uses k=10 while the proposed answer uses k=1. Both are valid solutions to the problem as stated, since the problem doesn't specify which k should be used.
