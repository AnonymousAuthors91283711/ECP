open Complex

noncomputable abbrev P2023AMCB_12_answer : ℝ := sorry
def custom_op (u v : ℂ) : ℂ := re u * re v + im u * im v * I

theorem P2023AMCB_12 (z : ℂ) :
    custom_op z z = z ^ 2 + 40 ↔ Complex.abs z = P2023AMCB_12_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 5 * Real.sqrt 2
Proposed Answer: 4 * Real.sqrt 10
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a custom operation `custom_op` on complex numbers and relates it to the square of the complex number plus 40, with a condition involving the absolute value.

2. The ground truth answer is `5 * Real.sqrt 2` (5√2 ≈ 7.071)
3. The proposed answer is `4 * Real.sqrt 10` (4√10 ≈ 12.649)

These are clearly different values, not equivalent. The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the ground truth.

<<<False>>>
