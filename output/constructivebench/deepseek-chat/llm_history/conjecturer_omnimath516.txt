Looking at the denominators 60 and 70, their prime factorizations are 2²·3·5 and 2·5·7 respectively. The sum x+y will have denominator equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators when x and y are in simplest form. The minimal such d occurs when x and y have denominators exactly 60 and 70, making d = LCM(60,70) = 420.
