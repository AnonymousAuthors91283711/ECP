noncomputable abbrev olympiadbench2281_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2281 :
  (3 * (8 : ℝ) ^ x + 5 * (8 : ℝ) ^ x = 2 ^ 61 ↔ x = olympiadbench2281_answer) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 58 / 3
Proposed Answer: 61 / 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation given is: 3*(8^x) + 5*(8^x) = 2^61
2. We can simplify the left side: (3+5)*(8^x) = 8^(x+1)
3. So the equation becomes: 8^(x+1) = 2^61
4. Rewrite 8 as 2^3: (2^3)^(x+1) = 2^61 → 2^(3x+3) = 2^61
5. Therefore: 3x + 3 = 61 → 3x = 58 → x = 58/3

The ground truth answer (58/3) correctly follows from this derivation. The proposed answer (61/3) incorrectly solves the equation by setting 3x = 61 (missing the +3 term).
