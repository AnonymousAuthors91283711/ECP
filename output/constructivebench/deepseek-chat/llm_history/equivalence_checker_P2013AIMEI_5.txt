Ground Truth Answer: (81, 16, 3)
Proposed Answer: (8, 27, 63)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for positive integers a, b, c that satisfy:
   - A cubic equation involving cube roots of a and b, divided by c
   - The sum a + b + c = 98

2. Ground Truth Answer (81, 16, 3):
   - Sum: 81 + 16 + 3 = 100 ≠ 98 (This appears incorrect at first glance, but let's check the proposed answer)

3. Proposed Answer (8, 27, 63):
   - Sum: 8 + 27 + 63 = 98 (Correct sum)
   - Now check the cubic equation condition:
     Let x = (2 + 3 + 1)/63 = 6/63 = 2/21
     Plugging into 8x³ - 3x² - 3x - 1 ≈ -1.19 ≠ 0 (Doesn't satisfy)

However, the ground truth answer's sum is actually 100, not 98 as required. This suggests there might be an error in the ground truth answer or problem statement. The proposed answer satisfies the sum condition but fails the equation condition.

Given this analysis:
<<<False>>>
