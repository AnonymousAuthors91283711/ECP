From the problem statement and enumerated answers, we can see that we need to solve the equation 2x² = 9x - 4 with x ≠ 4, and then express 2x in terms of x. The equation is quadratic, so we can solve for x and then compute 2x.

The quadratic equation 2x² - 9x + 4 = 0 has solutions x = (9 ± √(81-32))/4 = (9 ± √49)/4 = (9 ± 7)/4, giving x = 4 or x = 1/2. Since x ≠ 4, we take x = 1/2, so 2x = 1.
