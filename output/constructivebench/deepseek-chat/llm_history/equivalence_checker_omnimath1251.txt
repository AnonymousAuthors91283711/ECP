Ground Truth Answer: 20736
Proposed Answer: 8! * 8! / (4! * 4!)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem is counting the number of 8-element subsets of an 8×8 grid (Fin 8 × Fin 8) with specific conditions:
   - Exactly one element in each row (first condition)
   - Exactly one element in each column (second condition)
   - Exactly 4 elements on even-sum diagonals and 4 on odd-sum diagonals

2. The first two conditions mean we're counting permutation matrices (equivalent to Latin squares of size 8).

3. The additional conditions about diagonal sums mean we need exactly half the points on each type of diagonal (even and odd sums).

4. The ground truth answer is 20736.

5. The proposed answer is 8! * 8! / (4! * 4!) which equals:
   40320 * 40320 / (24 * 24) = 2822400, which is much larger than 20736.

The proposed answer overcounts because it doesn't properly account for the diagonal constraints. The correct count is indeed 20736, which comes from a more sophisticated enumeration considering the parity constraints.
