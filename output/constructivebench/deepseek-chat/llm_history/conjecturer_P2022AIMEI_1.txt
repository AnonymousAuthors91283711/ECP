Looking at the problem, we need to find the sum of the constant terms (eval at 0) of two quadratic polynomials P and Q that satisfy given conditions. The error occurs because we're using real division without marking it as noncomputable.

The proposed answer simplifies to (53 - 272)/2 + (53 + 272)/2 = (-219)/2 + 325/2 = 106/2 = 53. This matches the pattern where the sum of the constant terms equals the y-value at x=20 (53) minus the effect of the quadratic terms.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<53>>> 

Explanation:
1. The error was due to using real division without noncomputable marker
2. The expression simplifies to 53
3. This makes sense because when we evaluate P(0) + Q(0), the quadratic terms cancel out (since P has +2x² and Q has -2x²)
4. The remaining linear terms also cancel out when summed, leaving just the sum of the constant terms
5. From the evaluations at x=20, we see P(20) + Q(20) = 53 + 53 = 106, but since the quadratics cancel at x=0, we get half this value (106/2 = 53)
