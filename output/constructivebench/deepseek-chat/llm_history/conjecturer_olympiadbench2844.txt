<<<2012 + 28>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks for the smallest year y > 2012 where the total days from 2012 to y-1 (accounting for leap years) is divisible by 7. 2012 was a non-leap year, and the Gregorian calendar repeats every 28 years in this century (since 2000 was a leap year). Thus 2012 + 28 = 2040 is the answer.
