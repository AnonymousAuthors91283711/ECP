Ground Truth Answer: 2 / 81
Proposed Answer: 1 / 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. First, let's compute pA and pB based on the given definitions:
   - pA = (2/3)³ + (1/3)³ = 8/27 + 1/27 = 9/27 = 1/3
   - pB = 2*(2/3)²*(1/3)² = 2*(4/9)*(1/9) = 8/81

2. Now compute pA - pB:
   - pA - pB = 1/3 - 8/81 = 27/81 - 8/81 = 19/81

3. Compare with the answers:
   - Ground truth: 2/81 (incorrect, as we calculated 19/81)
   - Proposed answer: 1/9 = 9/81 (also incorrect)

However, the ground truth answer is actually incorrect based on our calculations, while the proposed answer is also incorrect but closer to our calculation (9/81 vs 19/81). 

But since the problem asks us to compare the proposed answer with the ground truth answer, and neither matches our calculation, they are not equivalent to each other.
