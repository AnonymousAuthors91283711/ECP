theorem P2009AMCB_5
  (a b c : ℕ)
  (hprod : a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ c > 0 ∧ a = b ∧ a * b * c = 128) :
  a + b + c = P2009AMCB_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the given conditions:
1. a = b
2. a, b, c > 0
3. a * b * c = 128
Substituting a = b gives a² * c = 128. The possible factorizations are:
(1,1,128), (2,2,32), (4,4,8), (8,8,2). The sum a+b+c is maximized when a=b=4, c=8, giving 4+4+8=16.
