    (habavg : (5 + a + b) / 3 = 33) :
    (a + b) / 2 = omnimath2668_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 47
Proposed Answer: 49
Let's analyze the problem and both answers:

1. The problem gives us the equation (5 + a + b)/3 = 33
2. We need to find the value of (a + b)/2

Solution steps:
- From the given equation: 5 + a + b = 99 (multiplied both sides by 3)
- Then a + b = 94 (subtracted 5 from both sides)
- Therefore (a + b)/2 = 47 (divided both sides by 2)

The ground truth answer correctly follows these steps to arrive at 47.
The proposed answer of 49 is incorrect as it doesn't match the correct calculation.
