theorem omnimath990 (a : ℝ) (ha : 1 < a) :
  HasSum (fun i : ℕ => (a * i) / (a^i)) (omnimath990_answer a) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a => (a / (1 - a))^2
Proposed Answer: fun a : ℝ => a^2 / (a - 1)^2
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer:

1. Ground truth: (a / (1 - a))²
2. Proposed: a² / (a - 1)²

We can rewrite the ground truth:
(a / (1 - a))² = a² / (1 - a)²

Notice that (1 - a)² = (a - 1)² since squaring removes the sign difference.

Therefore:
a² / (1 - a)² = a² / (a - 1)²

The two expressions are mathematically equivalent.
