Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: 28
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a 4×4 matrix M where each entry M i j is defined as M₀₀ + j + 7i.

2. We then create a modified matrix M' where rows 1 and 3 (0-indexed) are reversed.

3. We need to calculate the absolute difference between the sums of the two diagonals of M'.

Calculating the diagonals:
- The main diagonal (diag1) will have elements from M' i i
- The anti-diagonal (diag2) will have elements from M' i (3-i)

For the given matrix structure, the difference between the diagonals is consistently 4, regardless of the value of M₀₀. The proposed answer of 28 is incorrect as it doesn't match this consistent difference.

<<<False>>>
