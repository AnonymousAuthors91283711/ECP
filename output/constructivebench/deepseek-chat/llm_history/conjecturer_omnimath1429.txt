The error occurs because the proposed answer references variables `p_H`, `p_M`, and `p_T` which are defined inside the theorem but not in the global scope. We need to substitute their actual values (1/4, 1/2, 1/4 respectively) into the expression.

Looking at the recursive equation in the theorem:
E = 1 + p_H*E + p_M*(1 + p_H*E + p_M*0 + p_T*E) + p_T*E

This simplifies to:
E = 1 + p_H*E + p_M + p_H*p_M*E + p_T*E
E = (1 + p_M) + (p_H + p_H*p_M + p_T)*E

Solving for E gives:
E = (1 + p_M) / (1 - p_H - p_T - p_H*p_M)

Substituting the given probabilities:
p_H = 1/4, p_M = 1/2, p_T = 1/4

The final answer should be the concrete value with these substitutions.

Looking at the problem, it appears to be solving a recursive expectation equation for some probability scenario involving H, M, T events. The current proposed answer has parentheses issues and incorrect probability terms.

The error suggests we need to mark it noncomputable since we're working with ℝ. The equation structure suggests we're calculating an expected value with recursive probabilities.

From the recursive definition:
E = 1 + (1/4)E + (1/2)(1 + (1/4)E + (1/4)E) + (1/4)E

Simplifying:
E = 1 + (1/4)E + (1/2) + (1/8)E + (1/8)E + (1/4)E
E = 3/2 + (1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/4)E
E = 3/2 + (3/4)E

Solving for E:
E - (3/4)E = 3/2
(1/4)E = 3/2
E = 6

Here's the corrected Lean answer:

Looking at the problem, we have a recursive expectation calculation for some process with probabilities p_H, p_M, p_T. The equation given is:
E = 1 + p_H*E + p_M*(1 + p_H*E + p_M*0 + p_T*E) + p_T*E

Simplifying this:
1. Distribute p_M: E = 1 + p_H*E + p_M + p_M*p_H*E + p_M*p_T*E + p_T*E
2. Collect E terms: E = (1 + p_M) + E*(p_H + p_M*p_H + p_M*p_T + p_T)
3. Substitute given probabilities (p_H=1/4, p_M=1/2, p_T=1/4):
   E = (1 + 1/2) + E*(1/4 + (1/2)*(1/4) + (1/2)*(1/4) + 1/4)
   = 1.5 + E*(1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/4)
   = 1.5 + E*(3/4)
4. Solve for E: E - (3/4)E = 1.5 => (1/4)E = 1.5 => E = 6

The correct answer is indeed 6, but we need to fix the syntax. The error occurs because we're mixing `abbrev` and `def`. We should use just one definition.
