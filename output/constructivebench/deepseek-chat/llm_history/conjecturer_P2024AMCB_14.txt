<<<25>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks for the number of distinct residues modulo 125 that can be expressed as n^100 for integer n. Since 125 = 5^3, we can use Euler's theorem and the Carmichael function λ(125) = 100, which divides 100. This implies there are φ(125)/gcd(100,λ(125)) = 100/4 = 25 distinct residues. The enumerated answers confirm this pattern.
