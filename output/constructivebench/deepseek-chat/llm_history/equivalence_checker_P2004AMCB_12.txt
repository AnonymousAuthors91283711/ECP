Ground Truth Answer: fun n => if n % 6 = 0 then 0 else 2004 - (n % 6)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n % 3 = 1 then 2002 else if n % 3 = 2 then 2003 else 2001
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive function f with initial values f(0)=2001, f(1)=2002, f(2)=2003 and a recurrence relation f(k+3) = f(k+1) + f(k) - f(k+2).

2. The ground truth answer shows a periodic pattern with period 6, where:
   - When n is divisible by 6, the result is 0
   - Otherwise, it's 2004 minus (n mod 6)

3. The proposed answer suggests a periodic pattern with period 3, mapping:
   - n mod 3 = 1 → 2002
   - n mod 3 = 2 → 2003
   - else → 2001

Let's check some values:
- For n=3: 
  Ground truth: 3%6=3 → 2004-3=2001
  Proposed: 3%3=0 → 2001 (matches)
- For n=4:
  Ground truth: 4%6=4 → 2004-4=2000
  Proposed: 4%3=1 → 2002 (doesn't match)
- For n=6:
  Ground truth: 6%6=0 → 0
  Proposed: 6%3=0 → 2001 (doesn't match)

The proposed answer only matches for n=3 and fails for other cases. The ground truth shows a more complex periodic behavior that the proposed answer doesn't capture.
