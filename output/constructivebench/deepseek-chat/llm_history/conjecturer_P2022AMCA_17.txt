Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to provide a real number answer that satisfies the given conditions. The error suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real numbers.

Looking at the problem, it's about finding a value of 'a' where the equation a*(sin x + sin(2x)) = sin(3x) has two distinct solutions in (0,π). The equation simplifies to a*(sin x + 2 sin x cos x) = sin x (3 - 4 sin² x). For x ≠ 0,π, we can divide by sin x to get a*(1 + 2 cos x) = 3 - 4(1 - cos² x), which is a quadratic in cos x.

The condition of having two distinct solutions suggests the quadratic should have two distinct roots in (-1,1). The sum of roots p+q+r=3/2 comes from the relationship between the coefficients. Therefore, the correct answer is 3/2, but we need to properly express it in Lean.

The equation simplifies to a*(sin x + 2 sin x cos x) = sin x (3 - 4 sin² x), which suggests potential solutions when sin x = 0 or when a(1 + 2 cos x) = (3 - 4 sin² x).

The proposed answer 3/2 seems reasonable as it's a critical value where the equation has multiple solutions. To fix the Lean error, we need to:
1. Mark the definition as noncomputable
2. Use Real.div for division

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2022AMCA_17_answer : ℝ := 3 / 2>>>

The explanation is that 3/2 is one of the critical values where the equation a*(sin x + sin(2x)) = sin(3x) has multiple solutions in (0,π), making it a candidate for the required answer. The noncomputable annotation is necessary because real number division isn't computable in Lean.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
