Ground Truth Answer: fun n => if Even n then n / (n + 2) else 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (n + 1) / (n + 2)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the value of a polynomial P at n+1, given its values at integers from 0 to n.

2. The ground truth answer gives a piecewise function based on whether n is even or odd:
   - If n is even: n/(n+2)
   - If n is odd: 1

3. The proposed answer gives a simpler formula: (n+1)/(n+2) for all n

Let's test some values:
- For n=0 (even):
  Ground truth: 0/2 = 0
  Proposed: 1/2 = 0.5
  Different

- For n=1 (odd):
  Ground truth: 1
  Proposed: 2/3 ≈ 0.666
  Different

- For n=2 (even):
  Ground truth: 2/4 = 0.5
  Proposed: 3/4 = 0.75
  Different

The answers consistently give different results, and the proposed answer doesn't match the piecewise behavior of the ground truth.
