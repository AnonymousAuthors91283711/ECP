theorem omnimath2674 : 
  ∃ (k : ℕ) (j : Fin 6), 
    (∑ i in Finset.range 6, if i = j.val then 0 else k + i) = 2012 ∧ 
    (List.sum (digits 10 (k + j.val))) = omnimath2674_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern from enumerated answers and analyzing the problem, we need to find the sum of digits of (k + j.val). The equation simplifies to 5k + (0+1+2+3+4+5-j) = 2012. Solving gives k = 400 when j=2. Then k+j.val=402, whose digit sum is 6.
