Based on the problem statement and error message, the issue is that division in ℝ is noncomputable in Lean by default. We need to either:
1. Mark the definition as noncomputable, or
2. Use rational numbers (ℚ) instead since the computation is exact

Looking at the expression (33*11 + 55*33)/(33 + 55), this simplifies to (363 + 1815)/88 = 2178/88 = 99/4, which is exactly representable as a rational number.

Here's the fixed answer using rational numbers:

<<<(33 * 11 + 55 * 33) / (33 + 55 : ℚ)>>>

Explanation:
1. The error occurs because real number division is noncomputable in Lean
2. The computation involves exact fractions, so we can use ℚ instead
3. We add type annotation : ℚ to the denominator to ensure the entire expression is treated as rational
4. The expression simplifies to 99/4 which is exact in ℚ
5. This avoids the noncomputability issue while maintaining mathematical correctness[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem, we need to compute a weighted average of two terms (33*11 and 55*33) with weights (33 and 55). The expression (33*11 + 55*33)/(33 + 55) is mathematically correct, but Lean is complaining about noncomputability with real numbers.

The key insight is that we can simplify the expression:
(33*11 + 55*33) = 33*(11 + 55) = 33*66
(33 + 55) = 88
So the expression simplifies to (33*66)/88 = 2178/88 = 24.75

Since we need a real number answer, we should represent this as a fraction or decimal. The most straightforward way is to use exact rational arithmetic.

Here's the fixed answer:

<<<(33 * 11 + 55 * 33) / (33 + 55 : ℚ)>>>

The explanation:
1. The original expression correctly represents the weighted average
2. By casting the denominator to ℚ (rational numbers), we avoid the noncomputability issue with ℝ
3. The expression will evaluate to 99/4 or 24.75 exactly in Lean
4. This matches the simplified calculation shown above
5. The type ℝ is still satisfied since ℚ can be coerced to ℝ in Lean[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem, we need to compute the weighted average of two products (33*11 and 55*33) with weights 33 and 55 respectively. The expression (33*11 + 55*33)/(33 + 55) simplifies to (363 + 1815)/88 = 2178/88 = 99/4.

The error occurs because Lean requires explicit casting to ℝ when dealing with division. Here's the corrected version:

<<<(33 * 11 + 55 * 33) / (33 + 55 : ℝ)>>>

Explanation:
1. The original expression was using ℚ (rationals) but the problem specifies ℝ (reals)
2. The division operation needs to be explicitly marked as real division
3. The simplified form 99/4 is indeed equal to the original expression
4. By casting the denominator to ℝ, we ensure the entire expression is treated as real division
5. The answer matches the enumerated calculation (2178/88 = 99/4)

The fix is minimal - just changing ℚ to ℝ in the denominator's type annotation. This makes the division operation work properly in the real number context while preserving the mathematical correctness of the expression.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem, we need to compute a weighted average of two terms (33*11 and 55*33) with weights (33 and 55). The expression (33*11 + 55*33)/(33 + 55) correctly represents this weighted average.

The error occurs because Lean's division operation on real numbers (ℝ) is noncomputable by default. We can fix this by either:
1. Using rational numbers (ℚ) which have computable division, or
2. Marking the definition as noncomputable since we're working with ℝ

Since the problem specifically asks for a real number answer, we'll use the second approach. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<(33 * 11 + 55 * 33) / (33 + 55)>>>

Explanation:
1. The numerator (33*11 + 55*33) combines the two weighted terms
2. The denominator (33 + 55) sums the weights
3. The division gives the weighted average
4. We remove the type annotation :ℝ since it's not needed - Lean will infer the correct type
5. The expression will need to be marked as noncomputable in the full solution, but we're just providing the core expression here

The simplified form of this expression would be (33*(11 + 55))/(33 + 55) = 33*66/88 = 2178/88 = 24.75, but we keep the original form as requested.
