Ground Truth Answer: fun ⟨x, y⟩ => 2 * x + (y - x^2)
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℝ × ℝ => p.2 - p.1^2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding a relationship between a and b given certain conditions about quadratic equations and midpoints.

2. The ground truth answer `fun ⟨x, y⟩ => 2 * x + (y - x^2)` simplifies to `2x + y - x²` or `y - x² + 2x`.

3. The proposed answer is `fun p : ℝ × ℝ => p.2 - p.1^2`, which is `y - x²` (using x,y coordinates).

The key difference:
- The ground truth includes both `y - x²` and `+ 2x` terms
- The proposed answer only has `y - x²`

The proposed answer is missing the crucial `2x` term that appears in the ground truth. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
