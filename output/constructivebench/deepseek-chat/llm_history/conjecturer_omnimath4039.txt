<<<9 * 15>>> 

Explanation: The problem describes a maximum matching scenario between girls and boys where each company represents a compatible subset. The maximal number occurs when we pair each girl with each compatible boy separately, giving 9*15 possible pairs. This matches the enumerated answer pattern.
