Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n^n - (n-1)^n) / (n^(n-1))
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (n * (n + 1)) / (2)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about calculating the average size of the image of a random function from Fin n to [1..n] (where n=2013).

2. The ground truth answer (n^n - (n-1)^n)/(n^(n-1)) makes sense because:
   - n^n is total number of functions
   - (n-1)^n is number of functions that miss at least one element
   - The difference gives total "image sizes" across all functions
   - Dividing by n^(n-1) gives the average

3. The proposed answer (n*(n+1))/2 is completely different:
   - It's a simple quadratic formula
   - Doesn't account for the exponential nature of function counting
   - Doesn't match the combinatorial interpretation

The answers are fundamentally different in both form and meaning. The proposed answer is incorrect.
