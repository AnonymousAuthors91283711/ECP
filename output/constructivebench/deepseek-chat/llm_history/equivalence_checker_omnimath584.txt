Ground Truth Answer: 5 / 3
Proposed Answer: (1 + sqrt 5) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a system of equations:
   - 20 + c = x
   - 50 + c = a * x
   - 100 + c = a² * x

2. We can solve this system:
   Subtract first equation from second: (50 + c) - (20 + c) = a*x - x → 30 = x(a - 1)
   Subtract second from third: (100 + c) - (50 + c) = a²x - a*x → 50 = x(a² - a)

3. Divide the two results: 50/30 = (a² - a)/(a - 1) → 5/3 = a(a - 1)/(a - 1) → 5/3 = a (for a ≠ 1)

The ground truth answer (5/3) matches exactly with our derivation. The proposed answer ((1 + sqrt 5)/2) is the golden ratio, which doesn't satisfy our equation.
