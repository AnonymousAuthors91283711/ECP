Ground Truth Answer: 24
Proposed Answer: 12
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n > 1 where the product of all its divisors equals n⁴.

2. For the ground truth answer 24:
   - Divisors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
   - Product: 1×2×3×4×6×8×12×24 = 331776
   - 24⁴ = 331776
   - This satisfies the condition

3. For the proposed answer 12:
   - Divisors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
   - Product: 1×2×3×4×6×12 = 1728
   - 12⁴ = 20736
   - 1728 ≠ 20736, so 12 doesn't satisfy the condition

The proposed answer 12 is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the given equation, while 24 does. There's no equivalence between these answers.
