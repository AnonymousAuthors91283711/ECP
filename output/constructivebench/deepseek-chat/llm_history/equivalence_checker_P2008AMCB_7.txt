abbrev P2008AMCB_7_answer : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem P2008AMCB_7 (x y : ℝ) :
    ((x - y)^2 - (y - x)^2)^2 = P2008AMCB_7_answer x y := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => 0
Proposed Answer: fun x y : ℝ => 4 * (x - y)^4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to simplify ((x - y)^2 - (y - x)^2)^2
2. First, notice that (y - x) = -(x - y), so (y - x)^2 = (x - y)^2
3. Therefore, the expression becomes ((x - y)^2 - (x - y)^2)^2 = (0)^2 = 0
4. The ground truth correctly identifies this simplification
5. The proposed answer incorrectly claims it equals 4*(x - y)^4

The proposed answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the cancellation that occurs when subtracting identical terms. The correct simplification should result in 0, not a multiple of (x - y)^4.
