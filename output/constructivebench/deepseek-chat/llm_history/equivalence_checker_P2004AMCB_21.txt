Ground Truth Answer: 7/2
Proposed Answer: (5 + sqrt 10) / 2 + (5 - sqrt 10) / 2
Let's analyze the proposed answer and the ground truth answer:

1. The ground truth answer is 7/2 (which equals 3.5)
2. The proposed answer is (5 + sqrt 10)/2 + (5 - sqrt 10)/2
   - This simplifies to (5 + sqrt 10 + 5 - sqrt 10)/2 = 10/2 = 5

The simplified proposed answer (5) is not equal to the ground truth answer (3.5). Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
