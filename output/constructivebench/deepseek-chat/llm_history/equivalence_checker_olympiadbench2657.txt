Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer:  1300
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us T = 650 and logT = Real.log T
2. It also gives the equation: logT = 2 - Real.log 2 + Real.log k
3. Substituting logT = ln(650), we get:
   ln(650) = 2 - ln(2) + ln(k)
4. Solving for k:
   ln(k) = ln(650) - 2 + ln(2)
   k = e^{ln(650) - 2 + ln(2)} = 650 * e^{-2} * 2 = 1300/e^2 ≈ 1300/7.389 ≈ 175.9

The ground truth answer is 13, while the proposed answer is 1300. Neither matches the correct solution (which should be approximately 175.9). However, 1300 is exactly 100 times the ground truth answer of 13, suggesting a decimal place error in the proposed answer.
