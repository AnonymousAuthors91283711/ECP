Ground Truth Answer: fun (B, J, N) => (J * 5 * N : ℚ) / 100
Proposed Answer: fun ⟨B, J, N⟩ => (4*B + 5*J)*N/100
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. The ground truth answer is: (J * 5 * N) / 100
2. The proposed answer is: (4*B + 5*J)*N/100

Let's expand the proposed answer:
(4*B + 5*J)*N/100 = (4*B*N + 5*J*N)/100 = (4*B*N)/100 + (5*J*N)/100

This shows the proposed answer includes an extra term (4*B*N)/100 that doesn't appear in the ground truth answer. The ground truth only includes the (5*J*N)/100 portion.

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent unless B = 0, but the problem states hB : B > 0, so they are not equivalent.
