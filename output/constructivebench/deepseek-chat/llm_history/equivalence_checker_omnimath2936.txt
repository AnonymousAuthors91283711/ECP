Ground Truth Answer: 11/5  -- 2.2 as exact rational
Proposed Answer: (8 + 1 + 5 + 4) / 2 - 8
Let me analyze this carefully.

1. The problem gives us a 3x3 matrix M with specific constraints:
   - Known values: M₀₀=8, M₀₁=1, M₁₁=5, M₂₂=4
   - Row sum equality: M₀₀ + M₀₁ + M₀₂ = M₁₀ + M₁₁ + M₁₂
   - Column sum equality: M₀₀ + M₁₀ + M₂₀ = M₀₁ + M₁₁ + M₂₁
   - Diagonal equality: M₀₀ + M₁₁ + M₂₂ = M₀₂ + M₁₁ + M₂₀

2. The ground truth answer is 11/5 (2.2).

3. The proposed answer is (8+1+5+4)/2 - 8 = (18)/2 - 8 = 9 - 8 = 1.

4. Comparing the results:
   - Ground truth: 2.2
   - Proposed: 1.0

5. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth, and the method of simply summing known values and dividing by 2 then subtracting 8 doesn't appear to correctly incorporate all the given constraints.
