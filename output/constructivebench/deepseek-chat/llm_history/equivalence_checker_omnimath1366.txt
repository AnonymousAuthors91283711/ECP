Ground Truth Answer: (-1 + sqrt 5) / 2
Proposed Answer: sqrt ((sqrt 5 - 1) / 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem asks for a unique positive real number x that satisfies:
   - 0 < x
   - cos(arctan x) = x
   - x² = omnimath1366_answer

2. Let's solve cos(arctan x) = x:
   - Let θ = arctan x, then tan θ = x
   - cos θ = 1/√(1 + x²) from trigonometric identities
   - So the equation becomes: 1/√(1 + x²) = x
   - Squaring both sides: 1/(1 + x²) = x²
   - Rearranging: x⁴ + x² - 1 = 0
   - Let y = x²: y² + y - 1 = 0
   - Solution: y = (-1 ± √5)/2
   - Since x > 0 and y = x² must be positive, we take y = (-1 + √5)/2
   - Therefore x = √[(-1 + √5)/2]

3. Comparing with the answers:
   - Ground truth gives (-1 + √5)/2 (which is y)
   - Proposed answer gives √[(√5 - 1)/2] which is equivalent to √[(-1 + √5)/2] (which is x)

4. The ground truth gives y (x²) while the proposed answer gives x. They are not equal but related by x² = y.
