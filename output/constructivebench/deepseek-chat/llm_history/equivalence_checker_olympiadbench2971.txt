Ground Truth Answer: 98721
Proposed Answer: 98280
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the largest number between 10,000 and 99,999 that:
   - Has all distinct digits (digits.Nodup)
   - Is divisible by 63 (63 ∣ n)

2. Checking the ground truth answer 98721:
   - Digits: 9,8,7,2,1 - all distinct
   - 98721 ÷ 63 = 1567 exactly (divisible)
   - It's a large number in the range

3. Checking the proposed answer 98280:
   - Digits: 9,8,2,8,0 - has duplicate 8s (fails Nodup condition)
   - 98280 ÷ 63 = 1560 exactly (divisible)
   - While it's divisible by 63, it fails the distinct digits requirement

The proposed answer fails one of the key conditions (distinct digits), so it's not equivalent to the correct answer.
