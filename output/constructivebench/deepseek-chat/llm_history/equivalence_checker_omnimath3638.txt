abbrev omnimath3638_answer : ℕ → ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3638 (n : ℕ) :
  ∑ k in Finset.range (n + 1), (10^k - 1)/9 = omnimath3638_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (10^(n+1) - 10 - 9 * n) / 81
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (10^(n + 1) - 9 * n - 10) / 81
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. Both answers are functions taking a natural number n as input.
2. Both return a rational number (ℚ) as output.
3. The numerators are identical when expanded:
   - Ground truth: 10^(n+1) - 10 - 9*n
   - Proposed: 10^(n+1) - 9*n - 10
   These are exactly the same terms, just reordered (commutativity of addition/subtraction).
4. Both denominators are 81.
5. The division operation is the same in both cases.

The only difference is the order of terms in the numerator, which doesn't affect the mathematical equivalence due to the commutative property of addition/subtraction.
