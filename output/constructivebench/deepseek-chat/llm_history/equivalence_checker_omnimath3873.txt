Ground Truth Answer: {2, 5}
Proposed Answer: {n | n = 1 ∨ n = 2 ∨ n = 3 ∨ n = 4 ∨ n = 5 ∨ n = 7 ∨ n = 11}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all natural numbers n > 0 where (n³ + 3) is divisible by (n² + 7).

2. Ground truth answer is {2, 5}, meaning only 2 and 5 satisfy this condition.

3. Proposed answer includes many more numbers: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11}.

Let's test some numbers:
- n=1: (1+3)=4, (1+7)=8 → 4%8=4≠0 → shouldn't be included
- n=2: (8+3)=11, (4+7)=11 → 11%11=0 → correct
- n=3: (27+3)=30, (9+7)=16 → 30%16=14≠0 → shouldn't be included
- n=4: (64+3)=67, (16+7)=23 → 67%23=21≠0 → shouldn't be included
- n=5: (125+3)=128, (25+7)=32 → 128%32=0 → correct
- n=7: (343+3)=346, (49+7)=56 → 346%56=10≠0 → shouldn't be included
- n=11: (1331+3)=1334, (121+7)=128 → 1334%128=54≠0 → shouldn't be included

Only n=2 and n=5 actually satisfy the condition, while the proposed answer incorrectly includes many other numbers.
