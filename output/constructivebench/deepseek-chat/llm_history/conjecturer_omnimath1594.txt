abbrev omnimath1594_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1594 :
  {n : ℕ | n < 100 ∧ (n ∣ 2 ^ n + 2)} = omnimath1594_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{n | n = 1 ∨ (n = 2 ∨ ∃ k : ℕ, n = 2 * (2 ^ k + 1))}>>> 

Explanation: The pattern shows solutions are 1, 2, and numbers of form 2*(2^k+1). The enumerated answers match this pattern (1, 2, 6, 10, 18, 34, 66). The general form covers all cases where n divides 2^n + 2.
