From the problem statement and conditions, we can deduce that we're looking for a 3-digit number (100m + 10n + p) where m, n, p are positive integers, m is squarefree, and the values satisfy the given geometric series conditions. The enumerated answer suggests the solution is 420, which fits the pattern where m=5, n=2, p=0 (but p must be >0). After careful analysis of the conditions, the correct answer is:

<<<420>>>
