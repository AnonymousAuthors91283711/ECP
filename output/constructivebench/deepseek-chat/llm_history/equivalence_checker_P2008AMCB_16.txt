Ground Truth Answer: {(4, 6), (5, 12)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b) | ∃ k : ℕ, a = k * (k + 1) ∧ b = (k + 1) * (k + 2)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for pairs (a,b) where b > a > 0 and there exist x,y such that:
   - x + 2 = a
   - y + 2 = b
   - x*y = a*b/2
   - 2 divides a*b

2. The ground truth gives two specific solutions: (4,6) and (5,12)

3. The proposed answer gives a parametric solution:
   a = k*(k+1)
   b = (k+1)*(k+2)

Let's test the proposed solution:
For k=1: a=2, b=6 → (2,6)
For k=2: a=6, b=12 → (6,12)

But only (4,6) and (5,12) are in the ground truth. The proposed solution doesn't match these pairs. The parametric form gives different solutions than what's required.

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It doesn't include (4,6) or (5,12)
2. The pairs it generates don't satisfy the original conditions (for example, for (2,6), x=0 which violates a>0 since x+2=a)

<<<False>>>
