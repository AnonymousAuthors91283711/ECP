Ground Truth Answer: 43/48
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the value of k that satisfies a system of two logarithmic equations with constraints on x and y.

2. The ground truth answer is 43/48 ≈ 0.8958

3. The proposed answer is 2

The two answers are significantly different (0.8958 vs 2). The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the given equations when substituted back, while 43/48 does.
