Ground Truth Answer: (π - 2)/4
Proposed Answer: 1/4 - π/8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the area of a region in the unit square [0,1]×[0,1] where:
   - a + b > 1
   - And one of three conditions holds:
     * a² + b² < 1 (inside quarter-circle)
     * a² + 1 < b²
     * b² + 1 < a²

2. The ground truth answer is (π - 2)/4 ≈ 0.2854
3. The proposed answer is 1/4 - π/8 ≈ -0.1427

The proposed answer is negative, which cannot be correct for an area. Moreover, the magnitude is different. The two answers are not equivalent.
