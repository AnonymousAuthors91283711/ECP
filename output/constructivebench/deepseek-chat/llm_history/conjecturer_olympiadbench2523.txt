The error occurs because Lean uses `^` for exponentiation rather than `²`. Also, we need to properly format the set comprehension. Here's the corrected version:

<<<{(0, 0), (0, 5/2), (1/2, 2), (-1/2, 2)} ∪ { (x, 2 * x^2 - 1/2) | x : ℝ }>>>

Explanation:
1. The error was due to using `x²` instead of `x^2` and missing proper spacing/formatting in the set comprehension.
2. The solution combines:
   - Four discrete points from solving the system when x=0 or y=0
   - A parametric curve (x, 2x² - 1/2) that satisfies both equations when neither x nor y is zero
3. The enumerated answers show the discrete points, while the curve represents the infinite solution set when both factors are non-zero.
4. The correction maintains the mathematical meaning while using proper Lean syntax.
