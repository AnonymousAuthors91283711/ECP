The error occurs because the proposed answer is trying to use variables (`additional_lines` and `initial_regions`) that are defined inside the theorem statement but aren't accessible in the abbreviation. The solution needs to be expressed purely in terms of the problem's parameters (2 initial lines and 25 additional lines).

Looking at the pattern:
- Initial lines = 2 → 4 regions
- Each new line n adds (n+1) new regions
- The total regions after adding k lines is 4 + sum_{n=1}^k (n+1) = 4 + (k(k+1)/2 + k) = 4 + (k(k+3))/2

For k=25 additional lines, this becomes 4 + (25*28)/2 = 354.

The generalized form should take the initial condition (2 lines → 4 regions) and add the triangular number pattern for additional lines. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<4 + (25 * (25 + 3)) / 2>>>

Explanation:
1. The initial 2 lines create 4 regions (given)
2. Each new line n intersects all previous lines and creates (n+1) new regions
3. The sum for k additional lines is triangular numbers plus k: k(k+1)/2 + k = k(k+3)/2
4. Total regions = initial 4 + k(k+3)/2
5. For k=25: 4 + 25*28/2 = 354[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

From the problem statement and error message, I can see this is about counting regions formed by lines in a plane. The initial setup has 2 lines creating 4 regions, and we're adding 25 more lines. The error is just a syntax issue with line breaks.

The pattern suggests:
1. Initial regions: 4 (from 2 lines)
2. Each new line k (from 1 to 25) adds (k + 1) new regions
3. Total new regions would be sum from k=1 to 25 of (k + 1) = (25*26)/2 + 25 = (25*28)/2

Here's the fixed answer in Lean:

<<<4 + (25 * (25 + 3)) / 2>>>

The error was just missing line breaks between let declarations. The mathematical formula is correct based on:
- Initial 4 regions
- Each new line k adds (k+1) regions
- Summing from k=1 to 25 gives (25*28)/2
- Total is initial + new regions[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
