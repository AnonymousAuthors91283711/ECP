Explanation: The problem counts weakly increasing functions from Fin 10 to Fin 9 with image size ≤3. This is equivalent to counting multisets of size 10 with ≤3 distinct elements from 9 options. The answer sums binomial coefficients for all possible image sizes (0 through 3) of 9+10-1 choose 10, which simplifies to 18 choose k for k=0 to 3.
