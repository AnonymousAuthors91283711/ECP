Ground Truth Answer: 501
Proposed Answer: 3^10 - 2^11 + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem is counting the number of ordered pairs of non-empty disjoint subsets of {1,2,...,10}. The ground truth answer is 501 (mod 1000).

The proposed answer gives a formula: 3¹⁰ - 2¹¹ + 1.

Let's evaluate this formula:
3¹⁰ = 59049
2¹¹ = 2048
59049 - 2048 + 1 = 57002

Now take mod 1000: 57002 mod 1000 = 002

But the ground truth is 501, not 2. The answers don't match.

The correct formula should be (3¹⁰ - 2×2¹⁰ + 1)/2 for unordered pairs, but since the problem asks for ordered pairs, it should be 3¹⁰ - 2¹¹ + 1, but as we saw, this doesn't give 501.
