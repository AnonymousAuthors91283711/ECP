Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to provide a noncomputable real number solution. The equation given is a linear combination of the answer variable, and we can solve it algebraically. The proposed answer correctly solves the equation but needs to be marked as noncomputable since it involves real number division.

The equation simplifies to:
0.2x + 0.1*0.8x = 10500
(0.2 + 0.08)x = 10500
x = 10500 / 0.28

Here's the corrected answer:
