theorem olympiadbench2823 :
  ∃ (d : ℕ), (let a := fun n => 10 + (n - 1) * d;
    a (a 2) = 100 ∧ a (a (a 3)) = olympiadbench2823_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern:
- a(n) = 10 + (n-1)*d
- a(a(2)) = 100 ⇒ a(2) = 10 + d ⇒ a(a(2)) = 10 + (10+d-1)*d = 100
- Solving gives d=9 (since d must be natural)
- Then a(a(a(3))) = a(a(10+2*9)) = a(a(28)) = a(10+27*9) = 10+253*9 = 2287
