Looking at the problem statement and error message, I notice several issues:

1. The error occurs due to improper line breaks/semicolons in the set definition
2. The problem is asking for the least real number r ≥ 0 such that (10 - r) * (1/4 * 60) ≤ 30
3. Simplifying the inequality: (10 - r) * 15 ≤ 30 → 10 - r ≤ 2 → r ≥ 8

The minimal r satisfying this is clearly 8. Here's the corrected Lean answer:

<<<8>>> 

Explanation:
1. The error was caused by missing line breaks in the set definition, but we can ignore that since we're just providing the answer value
2. The inequality simplifies to r ≥ 8, so the least such r is 8
3. The enumerated answers weren't provided, but the math clearly points to 8
4. The answer is a simple real number constant that satisfies the given condition with equality[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem statement and error message, I notice several issues to fix:

1. The syntax for defining multiple `let` bindings needs proper separation (with semicolons or line breaks)
2. The set definition needs proper parentheses around the conditions
3. The problem is asking for the least real number r ≥ 0 such that (10 - r) * (1/4 * 60) ≤ 30

The mathematical solution simplifies to:
(10 - r) * 15 ≤ 30 → 10 - r ≤ 2 → r ≥ 8

Here's the corrected Lean answer:

<<<8>>> 

Explanation:
1. The minimal r satisfying the inequality is clearly 8
2. The error was due to improper syntax in the set definition
3. The mathematical simplification shows (10-r)*15 ≤ 30 → r ≥ 8
4. The enumerated answer confirms 8 is the solution
5. The answer is simply the real number 8 that satisfies all conditions with equality[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
