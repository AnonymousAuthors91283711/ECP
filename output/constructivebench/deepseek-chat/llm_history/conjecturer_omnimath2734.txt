The error occurs because the proposed answer tries to use variables `a,b,c,d,e` that aren't defined in the scope of the abbreviation. We need to express the answer purely in terms of the given averages.

From the problem:
1. (a+b+c)/3 = 16 → a+b+c = 48
2. (c+d+e)/3 = 26 → c+d+e = 78
3. (a+b+c+d+e)/5 = 20 → a+b+c+d+e = 100

To find c, we can add equations 1 and 2:
(a+b+c) + (c+d+e) = 48 + 78 → a+b+2c+d+e = 126

Subtract equation 3 from this:
(a+b+2c+d+e) - (a+b+c+d+e) = 126 - 100 → c = 26

Thus, the correct answer is simply 26. Here's the Lean expression:

<<<26>>>
