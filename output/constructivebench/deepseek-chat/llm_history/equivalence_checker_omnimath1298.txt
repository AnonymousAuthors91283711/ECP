Ground Truth Answer: fun (n, m) => if Even n ∨ Even m then choose (n + m) n else 0
Proposed Answer: fun (n, m) => choose (n + m) n - choose (n + m - 1) (n - 1)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting certain binary paths (functions from Fin(n+m) to Bool) with specific constraints on the counts of true/false values and parity conditions.

2. The ground truth answer states:
   - If either n or m is even, the count is choose(n+m, n)
   - Otherwise (both odd), the count is 0

3. The proposed answer gives a combinatorial expression: choose(n+m, n) - choose(n+m-1, n-1)

Let's evaluate the equivalence:

- When n or m is even:
  - Ground truth gives choose(n+m, n)
  - Proposed gives choose(n+m, n) - choose(n+m-1, n-1)
  - These are not equal in general (e.g., n=2, m=2: 6 vs 6-2=4)

- When both n and m are odd:
  - Ground truth gives 0
  - Proposed gives choose(n+m, n) - choose(n+m-1, n-1)
  - These are equal in this case (by combinatorial identities when both odd)

The proposed answer is only correct when both n and m are odd, but incorrect otherwise. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
