Ground Truth Answer: 12
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n where:
   - n = r + b (total balls)
   - r/(r+b) = 1/3 (probability condition 1)
   - r/(r+b+4) = 1/4 (probability condition 2)

2. From r/(r+b) = 1/3, we get 3r = r + b ⇒ b = 2r
   So n = r + b = 3r

3. From r/(3r + 4) = 1/4, we get 4r = 3r + 4 ⇒ r = 4
   Therefore n = 3r = 12

The ground truth answer (12) is correct based on this derivation. The proposed answer (8) doesn't satisfy both conditions:
- If n=8, r would be 8/3 which isn't an integer
- The conditions require r to be exactly 4, leading to n=12

<<<False>>>
