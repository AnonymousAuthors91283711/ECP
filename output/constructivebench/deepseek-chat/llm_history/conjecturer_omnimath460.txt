From the given conditions, we need to find a prime p between 100 and 500 where:
1. e = 2016 mod (p-1)
2. e - (p-1)/2 = 21

Solving the second equation gives e = 21 + (p-1)/2. Substituting into the first equation and solving modulo p-1 leads to p-1 dividing 3990. The only prime in range satisfying this is 211.
