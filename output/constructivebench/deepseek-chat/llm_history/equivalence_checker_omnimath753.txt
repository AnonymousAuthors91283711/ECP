abbrev omnimath753_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath753 :
    {x : ℝ | x = ∑' n : ℕ, (-1) ^ (n + 1) * x ^ n} = omnimath753_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(-1 + Real.sqrt 5) / 2}
Proposed Answer: {x : ℝ | x = x / (1 + x) ∧ |x| < 1}
Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is about finding real numbers x that satisfy x = ∑' n : ℕ, (-1) ^ (n + 1) * x ^ n.

2. The ground truth gives a specific solution: the golden ratio conjugate (-1 + √5)/2 ≈ 0.618.

3. The proposed answer gives a set defined by x = x/(1+x) and |x| < 1.

Let's examine the proposed answer:
- The equation x = x/(1+x) simplifies to x(1+x) = x → x + x² = x → x² = 0 → x = 0
- But x=0 doesn't satisfy the original series (which sums to 0, but the ground truth shows a non-zero solution exists)
- The condition |x| < 1 is correct for convergence, but the equation is wrong

The correct equation should come from recognizing the series as:
∑ (-1)^(n+1) x^n = -∑ (-x)^n = -[1/(1-(-x)) - 1] = x/(1+x) when |x| < 1
But we need x = x/(1+x), which as shown only gives x=0, missing the ground truth solution.
