Looking at the series structure, we can observe that each term is of the form (2^(2^n))/(4^(2^n)-1). Let's simplify the denominator:
4^(2^n) = (2^2)^(2^n) = 2^(2*2^n) = (2^(2^n))^2

Thus the general term becomes:
(2^(2^n))/((2^(2^n))^2 - 1) = x/(x^2-1) where x = 2^(2^n)

This can be rewritten using partial fractions as:
1/2 [1/(x-1) - 1/(x+1)]

When we sum this telescoping series, most terms cancel out, leaving us with the first term's positive part: 1/2 * 1/(2^(2^0)-1) = 1/2 * 1/1 = 1/2

However, we need to consider the negative part from the last term, but since the series converges, this approaches zero. The correct sum should indeed be 1/3, as the partial sums converge to this value.

The error message suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real number division. Here's the corrected answer:

Looking at the series structure, we can observe that each term is of the form (2^(2^n))/(4^(2^n)-1). Notice that 4^(2^n) = (2^2)^(2^n) = 2^(2*2^n) = 2^(2^(n+1)), so we can rewrite the denominator.

The series appears to telescope when we consider partial fraction decomposition. Let's examine the pattern:
- For n=0: term = 2/(4-1) = 2/3
- For n=1: term = 4/(16-1) = 4/15
- Sum of first two terms: 2/3 + 4/15 = 14/15
- n=2: term = 16/(256-1) = 16/255
- Sum: 14/15 + 16/255 = 254/255

This suggests the partial sums are of the form (2^(2^(k+1)) - 2)/(2^(2^(k+1)) - 1), which approaches 1 as k → ∞. However, the initial proposed answer of 1/3 seems incorrect based on this pattern.

The correct sum should be 1, as the partial sums clearly converge to 1. The error in Lean is due to needing to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real numbers.
