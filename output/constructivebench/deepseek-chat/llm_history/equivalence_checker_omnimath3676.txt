Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n = 0 then 1 else n
<<<Close>>>

The proposed answer is mostly correct but differs in the case when n=0. The ground truth answer simply returns n for all inputs, while the proposed answer returns 1 when n=0 and n otherwise. For the problem's context (where factorials are involved), this is close since 0! = 1, but not exactly equivalent to the identity function. The difference matters when considering the function's behavior at 0, even though it's correct for all positive integers.
