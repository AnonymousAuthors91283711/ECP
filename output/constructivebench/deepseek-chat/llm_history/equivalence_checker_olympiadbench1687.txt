Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n, 1)
Proposed Answer: fun n => (2 * n + 1, n + 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem states a functional equation that must hold for all natural numbers n:
   iterate f (g n + 1) n + iterate g (f n) n = f (n + 1) - g (n + 1) + 1

2. The ground truth answer suggests f(n) = n and g(n) = 1 for all n.

3. The proposed answer suggests f(n) = 2n + 1 and g(n) = n + 1.

Let's test both answers with n=0 (assuming ℕ includes 0):

For ground truth (n,1):
- Left side: iterate f (1 + 1) 0 + iterate g (0) 0 = f(f(0)) + 0 = f(0) = 0
- Right side: f(1) - g(1) + 1 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1
- Doesn't match (0 ≠ 1), but this might be due to n=0 edge case.

For proposed answer (2n+1,n+1):
- Left side: iterate f (n+1 + 1) n + iterate g (2n+1) n
- For n=1: iterate f 3 1 + iterate g 3 1 = f(f(f(1))) + g(g(g(1))) = f(f(3)) + g(g(2)) = f(7) + g(3) = 15 + 4 = 19
- Right side: f(2) - g(2) + 1 = 5 - 3 + 1 = 3
- Doesn't match (19 ≠ 3)

The ground truth answer actually doesn't work for n=0, but the proposed answer fails more dramatically. The correct answer should be f(n)=n and g(n)=1 (with possible adjustment for n=0), making the proposed answer incorrect.
