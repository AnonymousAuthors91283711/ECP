Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to make the answer noncomputable since it involves Real.sqrt. The proposed answer seems to follow a pattern involving √3 terms, which is reasonable given the exponents in the problem (4,5,6) suggest trigonometric or radical solutions.

The error occurs because Real.sqrt is noncomputable in Lean, so we need to mark the definition accordingly. The answer should be a real number involving √3 terms, and the proposed form looks plausible based on the problem's structure.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2015AIMEII_14_answer : ℝ := 3 * Real.sqrt 3 * (2 + Real.sqrt 3)>>>

The explanation is:
1. The problem involves symmetric equations in x and y with exponents 4,5,6
2. The solution likely involves √3 due to trigonometric identities or radical solutions
3. The form 3√3(2+√3) is a reasonable candidate that simplifies to 6√3 + 9
4. The noncomputable marker is needed because Real.sqrt is involved[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to make the answer noncomputable since it involves Real.sqrt. The proposed answer seems to follow a pattern of involving √3 terms, which is reasonable given the exponents in the problem (4,5,6 combinations). The error suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2015AIMEII_14_answer : ℝ := 3 * Real.sqrt 3 * (2 + Real.sqrt 3)>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem involves solving a system of equations with exponents 4,5,6, suggesting solutions involving roots of 3 (since 810 = 2*3^4*5 and 945 = 3^3*5*7)
2. The proposed form 3√3(2+√3) matches this pattern and satisfies dimensional consistency
3. The noncomputable marker is needed because Real.sqrt is a noncomputable operation in Lean
4. The answer maintains the structure of the original proposal while fixing the compilation error[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
