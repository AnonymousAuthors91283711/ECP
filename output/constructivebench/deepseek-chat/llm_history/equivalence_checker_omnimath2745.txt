  ∃ (l : List ℕ), l.Nodup ∧ l ⊆ [2, 3, 4, 6] ∧ l.length = 3 ∧ l.sum = 11 ∧ l.prod = omnimath2745_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 36
Proposed Answer: 24
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a list of 3 distinct numbers from [2,3,4,6] that sum to 11, and wants the product of these numbers.

2. Possible combinations of 3 distinct numbers from [2,3,4,6]:
   - 2,3,4 (sum=9, prod=24)
   - 2,3,6 (sum=11, prod=36)
   - 2,4,6 (sum=12, prod=48)
   - 3,4,6 (sum=13, prod=72)

3. Only one combination sums to 11: [2,3,6] with product 36.

4. The proposed answer is 24, which comes from [2,3,4], but this combination sums to 9, not 11.

The ground truth answer (36) is correct, while the proposed answer (24) is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy all conditions.

<<<False>>>
