<<<(7, 125)>>> 

Explanation: The problem involves calculating the area of a specific set S in the unit square. The conditions involve floor functions of logarithmic expressions with bases 2 and 5. The pattern suggests the area simplifies to a fraction 7/125, hence the answer (7,125) representing numerator and denominator. The coprime condition is satisfied since 7 and 125 share no common divisors.
