theorem omnimath677 (n : ℕ) (hn : n = 2003) :

Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2^n - 2) / 3
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (2^n + if n % 3 = 1 then 2 else -1) / 3
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
- We're looking at a sum of binomial coefficients where we only include terms where k ≡ 1 mod 3
- The ground truth answer suggests (2ⁿ - 2)/3
- The proposed answer is (2ⁿ + if n % 3 = 1 then 2 else -1)/3

Key Observations:
1. For n=1: 
   - Ground truth: (2-2)/3 = 0
   - Proposed: (2+2)/3 = 4/3 (since 1%3=1)
   - Actual sum: choose(1,1) = 1 ≠ 4/3

2. For n=2:
   - Ground truth: (4-2)/3 = 2/3
   - Proposed: (4-1)/3 = 1 (since 2%3=2)
   - Actual sum: choose(2,1) = 2 ≠ 1

3. For n=4:
   - Ground truth: (16-2)/3 = 14/3
   - Proposed: (16-1)/3 = 5 (since 4%3=1)
   - Actual sum: choose(4,1)+choose(4,4) = 4+1=5 (matches proposed)

The proposed answer seems to work for some cases (like n=4) but fails for others (n=1,2). The ground truth answer appears incorrect in all these cases. The correct formula should account for roots of unity and would be more complex than either proposal.
