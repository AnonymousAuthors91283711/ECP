<<<-(m + n) / 2>>> 

Explanation: The quadratic equation x² + (m+n)x + mn = 0 has roots at x = -m and x = -n. The problem asks for the least root excluding -n, which would be -m. However, since m and n are symmetric in the equation, the answer can be generalized as the average of the roots, -(m+n)/2, which equals -m when n > m. This matches the given values where T = 7/8 = -(-7)/8.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem statement and errors, I notice that:
1. The proposed answer uses variables m and n which are defined inside the theorem but not available in the global scope
2. The roots of the quadratic equation x² + (m+n)x + mn = 0 are -m and -n
3. We need to exclude -n and find the least remaining root, which would be -m
4. From the problem statement, m=7 and n=8, so the answer should be -7

The correct answer should be the constant value -7 rather than an expression using m and n, since those are fixed in the problem. Here's the fixed answer:

<<<(-7 : ℚ)>>>

Explanation:
- The quadratic equation factors as (x+m)(x+n)=0 with roots -m and -n
- We're asked to exclude -n and find the least remaining root
- With m=7 and n=8, the remaining root is -7
- The answer must be of type ℚ, so we include the type annotation
- The enumerated answer confirms this is the expected solution
