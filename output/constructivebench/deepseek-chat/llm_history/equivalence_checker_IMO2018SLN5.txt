Ground Truth Answer: False
Proposed Answer: ∀ (x y z t : ℕ), (∃ k : ℕ, x = k + 1 ∧ y = k + 2 ∧ z = k ∧ t = k + 3) → (x * y - z * t = x + y ∧ x + y = z + t ∧ ¬ (IsSquare (x * y) ∧ IsSquare (z * t)))

The proposed answer provides a specific family of solutions (parameterized by k) that satisfies the given conditions, but it doesn't cover all possible cases that might satisfy the original problem's conditions. The original problem is a universal statement about all x,y,z,t satisfying certain conditions, while the proposed answer only shows one family of solutions. Therefore, the proposed answer is partially correct (it does provide valid examples where the statement holds), but not fully equivalent to the ground truth answer.
