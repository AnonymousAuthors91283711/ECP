theorem P2017AMCB_2
  (x y z : ℝ)
  (hx : 0 < x ∧ x < 1)

Ground Truth Answer: fun x y z => y + z
Proposed Answer: fun x y z => x * y * z
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem states that for x ∈ (0,1), y ∈ (-1,0), and z ∈ (1,2), we need to show that some expression is positive.

2. Ground truth answer is y + z:
   - Since y > -1 and z > 1, y + z > -1 + 1 = 0
   - This correctly satisfies the condition 0 < P2017AMCB_2_answer x y z

3. Proposed answer is x * y * z:
   - x > 0, y < 0, z > 0 ⇒ product is negative (positive × negative × positive)
   - This would give P2017AMCB_2_answer x y z < 0, which contradicts the theorem statement

The proposed answer gives the wrong sign and doesn't satisfy the required condition, while the ground truth answer correctly satisfies it.
