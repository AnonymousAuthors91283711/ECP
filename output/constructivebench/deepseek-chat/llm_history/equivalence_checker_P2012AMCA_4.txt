Ground Truth Answer: 4 / 7
Proposed Answer: 1 / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. From the problem, we have:
   - b = 3/5 of total marbles (b + r)
   - r = total marbles - b = 2/5 of total marbles

2. After transformation:
   - newb = b (unchanged)
   - newr = 2 * r = 4/5 of original total
   - newtotal = newb + newr = 3/5 + 4/5 = 7/5 of original total

3. The ratio newr/newtotal:
   - (4/5) / (7/5) = 4/7

The ground truth answer (4/7) is correct, while the proposed answer (1/2) is incorrect. The calculations clearly show the correct ratio should be 4/7, not 1/2.
