Explanation: The problem gives a quartic polynomial with complex roots 2i and 2+i. Since coefficients are real, complex roots come in conjugate pairs, so -2i and 2-i must also be roots. The sum of roots (2i + (-2i) + (2+i) + (2-i) = 4 equals -coeff f 3, so coeff f 3 = -4. The other coefficients sum to 8 when evaluated, making the total 4.
