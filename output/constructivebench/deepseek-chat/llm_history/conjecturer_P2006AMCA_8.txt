From the problem statement and enumeration, we're counting pairs (p₁, p₂) where:
1. p₁ > 0
2. p₂ > 1
3. Sum of p₂ consecutive integers starting from p₁ equals 15

The sum condition simplifies to p₂*(2p₁ + p₂ - 1)/2 = 15. Looking for integer solutions gives us the pairs (15,1), (7,2), (4,3), (1,5), but only (7,2), (4,3), (1,5) satisfy p₂>1. Thus there are 3 valid pairs.
