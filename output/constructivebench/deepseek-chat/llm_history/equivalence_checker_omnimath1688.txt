Ground Truth Answer: 2^2009
Proposed Answer: 2^2009 - 1
Let me analyze this problem carefully.

The problem is about iterating the function f(x) = x² + 2x + 1 exactly 2009 times and expressing the result as a polynomial in x. The key part is determining the coefficient of the second-highest term (x^(2^2009 - 1)).

When we iterate f:
1. First iteration: f(x) = x² + 2x + 1
2. Second iteration: f(f(x)) = (x² + 2x + 1)² + 2(x² + 2x + 1) + 1 = x⁴ + 4x³ + ... (coefficient of x³ is 4)
3. Pattern shows that with each iteration, the coefficient of the second-highest term doubles.

For n iterations:
- The coefficient of x^(2^n - 1) is 2^n
- This forms a geometric progression: 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^2009

The ground truth answer is 2^2009, which matches this pattern. The proposed answer is 2^2009 - 1, which doesn't match the pattern we observe.
