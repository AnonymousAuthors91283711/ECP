Looking at the pattern of W n k for small values, we can observe that:
- W n 0 = n^n
- W n 1 = (n^n)^(n^n) = n^(n^(n+1))
- W n 2 = n^(n^(n^(n+1)+1))

For n=555, we need the last 3 digits of W 555 2. Since 555^2 = 308025, we can use Euler's theorem modulo 1000. The pattern suggests the answer is 625.
