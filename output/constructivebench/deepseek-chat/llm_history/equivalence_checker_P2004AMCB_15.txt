Ground Truth Answer: 18
Proposed Answer: 39
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a system of equations involving two-digit numbers j and b (both <100) where:
   - The tens digit of j equals the units digit of b
   - The units digit of j equals the tens digit of b
   - j + 5 = 2*(b + 5)
   - The absolute difference between j and b is the answer

2. Let's solve the equations:
   - Let j = 10a + c (where a is tens digit, c is units digit)
   - Let b = 10c + a (from the digit swapping conditions)
   - From j + 5 = 2(b + 5): 10a + c + 5 = 2(10c + a + 5) → 10a + c + 5 = 20c + 2a + 10 → 8a - 19c = 5
   - Solving this Diophantine equation for a,c ∈ {0,...,9} gives only one solution: a=6, c=2 → j=62, b=26
   - |62 - 26| = 36

3. The ground truth answer is 18 (incorrect) while the proposed answer is 39 (also incorrect). The correct answer should be 36.

Since neither answer matches the correct solution, but they're both incorrect in different ways:

<<<False>>>
