Ground Truth Answer: 110
Proposed Answer: 70
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for two things:
   - The smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n > 0 (which is given as 17)
   - The smallest m > 0 where 17² divides m⁴ + 1

2. We need to verify if 70 is the correct minimal m where 17² divides m⁴ + 1, compared to the ground truth answer of 110.

3. Calculations:
   - For m = 70: 70⁴ + 1 = 24010001
   - 17² = 289
   - 24010001 ÷ 289 ≈ 83079.588 (not divisible)
   - For m = 110: 110⁴ + 1 = 146410001
   - 146410001 ÷ 289 = 506609 (exact division)

The proposed answer (70) does not satisfy the condition since 289 doesn't divide 70⁴ + 1, while the ground truth answer (110) does satisfy it.
