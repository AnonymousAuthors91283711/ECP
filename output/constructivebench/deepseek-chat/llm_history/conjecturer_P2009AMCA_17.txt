Looking at the problem, we have two geometric series sums equal to their respective ratios, with distinct positive ratios r₁ and r₂. From the given conditions:
1. a/(1-r₁) = r₁ → a = r₁(1-r₁)
2. a/(1-r₂) = r₂ → a = r₂(1-r₂)

Setting them equal: r₁(1-r₁) = r₂(1-r₂)
This simplifies to r₁ - r₁² = r₂ - r₂² → r₁ - r₂ = r₁² - r₂² → r₁ - r₂ = (r₁ - r₂)(r₁ + r₂)
Since r₁ ≠ r₂, we can divide both sides by (r₁ - r₂) to get 1 = r₁ + r₂

The error in Lean is because we need to mark Real division as noncomputable. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2009AMCA_17_answer : ℝ := 1>>>

Explanation:
The key insight comes from equating the two expressions for 'a' and solving for r₁ + r₂. The enumerated answer suggested 1/2, but the algebraic derivation clearly shows the sum should be 1. The noncomputable annotation is needed because Real number operations in Lean aren't always computable.
