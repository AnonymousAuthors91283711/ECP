Looking at the problem constraints:
1. 5x5 matrix with distinct entries from -10 to 14
2. Magic square properties (equal row/column/diagonal sums)
3. The magic sum S must be unique

The minimal possible sum occurs when using the smallest 25 distinct integers (-10 to 14). The sum of first 25 integers (-10 to 14) is 50, so for 5 rows, S = 50/5 = 10.
