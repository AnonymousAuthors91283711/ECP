theorem omnimath1749 : 
  let f := fun x : ℕ => x^2 - 2
  let f24 := iterate f 24
  f24 18 % 89 = omnimath1749_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 47
Proposed Answer: 18
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a function f(x) = x² - 2 and asks to compute f applied 24 times to 18, modulo 89.

2. The ground truth answer is 47, which means (f^24)(18) ≡ 47 mod 89.

3. The proposed answer is 18, which would mean (f^24)(18) ≡ 18 mod 89.

To check if these are equivalent:
- The proposed answer claims that 18 is a fixed point after 24 iterations, but this is unlikely to be true for this function.
- A quick verification shows f(18) = 18² - 2 = 322 ≡ 322 - 3*89 = 322 - 267 = 55 mod 89 ≠ 18.
- The function doesn't cycle back to 18 quickly, so after 24 iterations it's very unlikely to return to 18.

The ground truth answer of 47 is correct based on mathematical computation, while the proposed answer of 18 is incorrect.
