From the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we can observe that the sum involves counting numbers n where 2010 divides x² - n for some x. Since 2010 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 67, we need to consider quadratic residues modulo 2010. The key insight is that the sum simplifies to 1005 (2010/2) because exactly half of the numbers in 0..2009 will have solutions.

<<<1005>>>
