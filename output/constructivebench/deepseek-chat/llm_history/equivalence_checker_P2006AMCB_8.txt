Ground Truth Answer: 9 / 4
Proposed Answer: (2 * 1 + 4 * 2 - 1 - 2) / 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. From the given conditions:
   - 1 = 1/4 * (2 + a) ⇒ 4 = 2 + a ⇒ a = 2
   - 2 = 1/4 * (1 + b) ⇒ 8 = 1 + b ⇒ b = 7

2. Therefore, a + b = 2 + 7 = 9

3. The ground truth answer is 9/4, which is incorrect since we've shown a + b = 9.

4. The proposed answer calculates:
   (2*1 + 4*2 - 1 - 2)/4 = (2 + 8 - 1 - 2)/4 = 7/4

5. Neither answer matches the correct solution of 9.

However, looking back at the problem statement, it's possible there was a misunderstanding. The theorem states that a + b equals some predefined value P2006AMCB_8_answer, which is given as 9/4 in the ground truth. But our calculation shows this would be incorrect.

The proposed answer (7/4) doesn't match either the ground truth (9/4) or the correct solution (9).
