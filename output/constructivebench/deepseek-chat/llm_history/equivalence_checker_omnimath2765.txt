abbrev omnimath2765_answer : ℚ → ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath2765 (n : ℚ) : 
  1/(2 * n) + 1/(4 * n) = 3/12 ↔ n = omnimath2765_answer 3 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℚ => x / 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find a function `omnimath2765_answer` such that the equation `1/(2*n) + 1/(4*n) = 3/12` holds if and only if `n = omnimath2765_answer 3`.

2. First, let's simplify the left side:
   `1/(2*n) + 1/(4*n) = (2 + 1)/(4*n) = 3/(4*n)`

3. The equation becomes: `3/(4*n) = 3/12` which simplifies to `1/(4*n) = 1/12` and then to `4*n = 12`, so `n = 3`.

4. The ground truth answer is the identity function `fun n => n`, meaning `omnimath2765_answer 3 = 3`.

5. The proposed answer is `fun x => x/3`, which would give `omnimath2765_answer 3 = 1`.

The proposed answer gives a different result (1) than what's needed (3) when x=3, so it's incorrect.
