theorem P2007AMCA_1 :
  let susanCost := 4 * (20 - (20 * 25 / 100))
  let pamCost := 5 * (20 - (20 * 30 / 100))
  pamCost - susanCost = P2007AMCA_1_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 10
Proposed Answer: 14
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. First, let's compute susanCost:
   - 20 * 25 / 100 = 5 (25% discount)
   - 20 - 5 = 15 (price after discount)
   - 4 * 15 = 60 (total cost for Susan)

2. Now compute pamCost:
   - 20 * 30 / 100 = 6 (30% discount)
   - 20 - 6 = 14 (price after discount)
   - 5 * 14 = 70 (total cost for Pam)

3. The difference pamCost - susanCost:
   - 70 - 60 = 10

The ground truth answer is indeed 10, while the proposed answer is 14. The proposed answer is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
