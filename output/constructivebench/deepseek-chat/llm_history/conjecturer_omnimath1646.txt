theorem omnimath1646 (n : ℕ) :
  (∃ a b : ℕ, a^2 + b^2 = n ∧ Nat.Coprime a b ∧ 
   ∀ p : ℕ, p.Prime → p ≤ Real.sqrt n → p ∣ a * b) ↔ n ∈ omnimath1646_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{n | ¬∃ p, p.Prime ∧ p ≡ 3 [MOD 4] ∧ p ∣ n}>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks for numbers n that can be expressed as a sum of two coprime squares, with additional conditions on prime divisors. From number theory, such numbers are exactly those where no prime ≡ 3 mod 4 divides n. The enumerated answers likely follow this pattern.
