      k ≠ l → floor ((n : ℝ) ^ (1 / (k : ℝ))) ≠ floor ((n : ℝ) ^ (1 / (l : ℝ))))} 
  olympiadbench2792_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern of enumerated answers and the problem's requirement for distinct floor values of n^(1/k) for k=1..8, the minimal n satisfying this is the smallest number where each root gives a unique integer part. The answer is the smallest n where the 8th root has a distinct floor from all smaller roots.
