theorem olympiadbench2902 (T : ℕ) (hT : T = 19) :
  let S1 := {n : ℚ | ∃ k, n = k / 4}
  let S2 := {n : ℚ | ∃ k, n = k / 6}
  let common := S1 ∩ S2
  (olympiadbench2902_answer T) ∈ common ∧

<<<fun k : ℕ => k / 12>>> 

Explanation: The sets S1 and S2 contain rationals with denominators 4 and 6 respectively. Their intersection common must have denominator lcm(4,6)=12. The pattern suggests the answer is k/12, which satisfies both conditions (can be written as (3k)/4 and (2k)/6). The enumeration shows this form matches the required properties.
