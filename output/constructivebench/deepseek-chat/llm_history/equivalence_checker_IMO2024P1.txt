Ground Truth Answer: {α : ℝ | ∃ k : ℤ, α = 2 * k}
Proposed Answer: {α | ∃ k : ℤ, α = k} ∪ {α | ∃ k : ℤ, α = k + 1/2}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for all real numbers α such that for every positive natural number n, n divides the sum of floor functions of (i+1)*α for i from 0 to n-1.

2. The ground truth answer suggests that only even integers satisfy this condition (α = 2k where k is integer).

3. The proposed answer suggests that all integers (α = k) and half-integers (α = k + 1/2) satisfy the condition.

Testing cases:
- For α = 1 (integer): n=2, sum is floor(1) + floor(2) = 1+2=3, but 2 doesn't divide 3. So integers don't generally work.
- For α = 1.5 (half-integer): n=2, sum is floor(1.5) + floor(3) = 1+3=4, which is divisible by 2. But for n=3, sum is floor(1.5)+floor(3)+floor(4.5)=1+3+4=8, which is not divisible by 3. So half-integers don't always work.

The ground truth answer correctly identifies that only even integers satisfy the condition for all n. The proposed answer includes many cases that don't work.
