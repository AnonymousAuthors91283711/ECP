Ground Truth Answer: 95
Proposed Answer: 48
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest rational number r satisfying certain conditions, and then asking for the sum of its numerator and denominator.

2. The ground truth answer is 95, which suggests the rational number is 48/47 (since 48 + 47 = 95).

3. The proposed answer is 48, which would correspond to a rational number where num + den = 48.

4. The expression given in the theorem evaluates to:
   - 6/7 + 5/49 * (1/(1-1/49)) = 6/7 + 5/49 * (49/48) = 6/7 + 5/48 = (288 + 35)/336 = 323/336
   - 323 + 336 = 659, which doesn't match either answer

However, there seems to be some confusion here:
- The ground truth answer (95) doesn't match the calculation from the given expression
- The proposed answer (48) is completely different and incorrect

Given that neither answer matches the actual calculation from the given expression, but the problem specifically states the ground truth is 95, we should consider the proposed answer (48) as incorrect.
