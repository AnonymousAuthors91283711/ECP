Ground Truth Answer: 1024
Proposed Answer: 65536
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of triples (words) in α × α × α where:
   - |α| = 16
   - For any two words w₁ and w₂ in the set, w₁.1 ≠ w₂.2.2 (first component of w₁ ≠ third component of w₂)

2. The ground truth answer is 1024, which makes sense because:
   - The constraint relates the first component of one word to the third component of another
   - We can think of this as a bipartite graph constraint
   - The maximum number would be 16 (choices for first component) × 16 (second component) × 4 (constrained third component) = 1024

3. The proposed answer is 65536, which is 16^3 (total possible triples without constraints). This clearly violates the given constraint.

The proposed answer is simply the total number of possible triples without considering the constraint, so it's incorrect.
