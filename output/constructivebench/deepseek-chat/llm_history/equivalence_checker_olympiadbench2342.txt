Ground Truth Answer: 10
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the least value of z = x² + 16y² under the constraint 3x + 4y = 10.

2. The ground truth answer is 10, which is correct. This can be verified using Lagrange multipliers or by expressing x in terms of y (or vice versa) from the constraint and substituting into the expression for z, then finding the minimum.

3. The proposed answer is 2, which is incorrect. The minimum value is indeed 10, achieved when x = 6/5 and y = 8/5.

4. The value 2 is too small and doesn't satisfy the original equation when substituted back.
