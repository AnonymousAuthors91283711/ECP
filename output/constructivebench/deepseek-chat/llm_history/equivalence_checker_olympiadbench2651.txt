Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 22
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have a system of equations:
   - x + 9y = 17
   - 40x + 41y = 42 (since T = 40)

2. Solving the system:
   From first equation: x = 17 - 9y
   Substitute into second equation: 40(17-9y) + 41y = 42
   => 680 - 360y + 41y = 42
   => -319y = -638
   => y = 2
   Then x = 17 - 9*2 = -1

3. Calculate 20x + 14y:
   20*(-1) + 14*2 = -20 + 28 = 8

The ground truth answer (8) is correct, while the proposed answer (22) is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
