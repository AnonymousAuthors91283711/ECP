From the problem conditions, we see that log a and log b are perfect squares (since their square roots are natural numbers). Letting sqrt(log a) = m and sqrt(log b) = n, we have log a = m² and log b = n². The condition on log a + log b = log(a*b) being a perfect square k² implies m² + n² = k², making (m,n,k) a Pythagorean triple. The product condition gives sqrt(m²n²) = l = mn must be natural. The simplest solution occurs when m = n = 1, giving a = b = e and a*b = e².

Based on the problem statement and error message, I can see this is about finding a closed form expression for a*b under certain logarithmic conditions. The error suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it uses Real.exp.

Looking at the conditions:
1. sqrt(log a) = m (natural number)
2. sqrt(log b) = n (natural number)
3. sqrt(log a + log b) = k (natural number)
4. sqrt(log a * log b) = l (natural number)

This suggests log a = m² and log b = n². Then:
- log a + log b = m² + n² = k²
- log a * log b = m²n² = l² ⇒ l = mn

The simplest solution satisfying m² + n² = k² is when (m,n,k) is a Pythagorean triple. The simplest case is (3,4,5), but the minimal case is (1,0,1) which is invalid since n>0. The next minimal valid case is (1,1,√2) but √2 isn't natural. The smallest integer solution is (3,4,5).

However, the enumerated answer suggests exp 2, which would correspond to log(a*b) = 2 ⇒ a*b = e². This fits when m=1, n=1:
- log a = 1, log b = 1
- log a + log b = 2 ⇒ k = √2 (invalid since k must be natural)
Thus exp 2 seems incorrect.

The correct minimal solution appears to be when m=1, n=1, but this violates the natural number condition for k. Therefore, the next possible solution is when m=3, n=4, k=5:
- a = exp(9), b = exp(16)
- a*b = exp(25)

But this contradicts the enumerated answer. Given the error and conditions, I believe the intended answer is:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2019AMCA_15_answer : ℝ := exp 25>>> 

However, this contradicts the enumerated hint of exp 2. Given the conditions require natural number solutions, exp 25 seems more plausible as it satisfies all conditions with (m,n,k)=(3,4,5). The error can be fixed by adding 'noncomputable'.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem statement and error message, I can see this is about finding a closed form expression for a*b given certain conditions on logarithms of a and b. The error occurs because Real.exp is noncomputable in Lean.

From the conditions:
1. sqrt(log a) = m (natural number)
2. sqrt(log b) = n (natural number)
3. sqrt(log a + log b) = k (natural number)
4. sqrt(log a * log b) = l (natural number)

We can derive:
log a = m²
log b = n²
log a + log b = k² ⇒ m² + n² = k²
log a * log b = l² ⇒ m² * n² = l² ⇒ m*n = l

The condition m² + n² = k² suggests Pythagorean triples. The simplest nontrivial case is (3,4,5), giving m=3, n=4, k=5, l=12.

Then:
a = exp(m²) = exp(9)
b = exp(n²) = exp(16)
a*b = exp(9+16) = exp(25)

The error suggests we need to mark this as noncomputable. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2019AMCA_15_answer : ℝ := exp 25>>>

The explanation is that the conditions lead to Pythagorean triples for (m,n,k), with the simplest solution giving exp(25) as the product a*b. The noncomputable annotation is needed because Real.exp is noncomputable in Lean.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem and error message, I notice:
1. The problem involves logarithms and exponents with constraints on a and b
2. The enumerated answer suggests a pattern involving squares (25 = 5^2)
3. The error indicates we need to make the definition noncomputable due to Real.exp

From the constraints:
- sqrt(log a) = m (natural number)
- sqrt(log b) = n (natural number)
- sqrt(log a + log b) = k (natural number)
- sqrt(log a * log b) = l (natural number)

This implies:
log a = m², log b = n²
Thus log(a*b) = log a + log b = m² + n² = k²
And sqrt(log a * log b) = sqrt(m²n²) = mn = l

Therefore, k² = m² + n² and l = mn
The simplest Pythagorean triple satisfying this is (m,n,k) = (3,4,5) where l=12
But the enumerated answer suggests 25, which is 5² (k²)

Thus a*b = exp(log a + log b) = exp(k²) = exp(25) for this case
Generalizing, the answer should be exp(k^2) where k is from h3

From the problem statement and error messages, I can see that:
1. The problem involves real numbers a, b > 0 with constraints on their logarithms
2. The proposed answer tried to use k.val^2 but k is not in scope
3. The constraints relate sqrt(log a), sqrt(log b), and their combinations to natural numbers

Looking at the conditions:
- sqrt(log a) = m (natural number)
- sqrt(log b) = n (natural number)
- sqrt(log a + log b) = k (natural number)
- sqrt(log a * log b) = l (natural number)

This suggests log a = m² and log b = n², so:
log(a*b) = log a + log b = m² + n² = k²
log a * log b = m²n² = l² ⇒ l = mn

Therefore, a*b = exp(log(a*b)) = exp(k²)

The error occurred because k was not defined in the answer. We should use the general form exp(k^2) where k comes from h3.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<exp (k^2)>>>

Explanation:
The key insight is that from the given conditions, we can express log a and log b as squares of natural numbers (m² and n² respectively). Then log(a*b) = m² + n² = k², so a*b = exp(k²). The error was trying to access k.val when we should just use k directly from the existential in h3.
