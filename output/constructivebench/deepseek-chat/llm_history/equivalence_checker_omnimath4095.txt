Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n / 2 + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 2 * n - 4
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal degree k for which every n-vertex regular graph with degree k must contain a triangle (3 vertices all adjacent to each other).

2. The ground truth answer is `n/2 + 1`, which is correct based on known graph theory results (this is related to Mantel's theorem and its extensions).

3. The proposed answer is `2*n - 4`, which grows much faster than the correct answer. For example:
   - For n=3: ground truth=2, proposed=2 (matches)
   - For n=4: ground truth=3, proposed=4 (doesn't match)
   - For n=5: ground truth=3, proposed=6 (doesn't match)

The proposed answer is incorrect for most values of n ≥ 4. The only case where it matches is n=3.
