Looking at the pattern from enumerated answers and the problem structure, the solution involves modulo 10 of the sum of a recursively defined sequence. The key observation is that the sums modulo 10 cycle every 4 steps starting from n=1: [2, 6, 2, 6, ...]. Since 2023 mod 4 is 3, the answer should be 6.
