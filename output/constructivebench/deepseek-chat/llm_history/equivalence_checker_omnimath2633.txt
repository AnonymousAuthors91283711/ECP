Ground Truth Answer: 21
Proposed Answer: 2^6
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting 8-digit numbers (10,000,000 to 99,999,999) where:
   - Last digit is 3 (n % 10 = 3)
   - First digit is 1 (n / 10^7 = 1)
   - Each subsequent digit is either (previous digit +1 mod 10) or (previous digit +2 mod 10)

2. Starting with 1, for each of the next 6 digits (since last is fixed as 3), we have 2 choices (+1 or +2 mod 10). The last digit must be 3, which constrains the previous choices.

3. The ground truth answer is 21, which comes from:
   - The first digit is fixed as 1
   - Next 6 digits each have 2 possibilities (but constrained by needing to end at 3)
   - The actual count is the number of valid paths in this constrained scenario, which is 21 (specifically, the 6th Fibonacci number)

4. The proposed answer is 2^6 = 64, which would be correct if there were no constraints on the final digit. However, the requirement to end at 3 reduces the valid combinations.
