Ground Truth Answer: 20
Proposed Answer: 103
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a system of equations with variables a, b, x, y and asks for the value of a*x⁵ + b*y⁵.

2. This is a classic problem that can be solved using recurrence relations. The sequence S_n = a*x^n + b*y^n satisfies a linear recurrence relation.

3. From the given values:
   S₁ = 3
   S₂ = 7
   S₃ = 16
   S₄ = 42

4. We can find the recurrence relation by solving for coefficients p and q such that:
   Sₙ₊₂ = p*Sₙ₊₁ + q*Sₙ

5. Using S₂ and S₃:
   16 = p*7 + q*3
   42 = p*16 + q*7

6. Solving these gives p = 6, q = -11

7. Therefore, S₅ = 6*42 + (-11)*16 = 252 - 176 = 76 (not 103 or 20)

Wait, this contradicts both answers. Let me double-check:

Using the recurrence Sₙ₊₂ = 6Sₙ₊₁ - 11Sₙ:
S₅ = 6*42 - 11*16 = 252 - 176 = 76

Neither 20 nor 103 matches this calculation. Therefore:

<<<False>>>
