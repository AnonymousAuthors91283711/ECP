theorem omnimath1887 :
  ∃ (h p z : ℕ),
    2 * h + 3 * p + 6 * z = 800 ∧
    8 * h + 9 * p + 12 * z = 2018 ∧
    h + p + z = omnimath1887_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern from enumeration and solving the system of equations, the solution is the sum h + p + z = 200. The coefficients suggest eliminating variables through linear combinations.

<<<200>>>
