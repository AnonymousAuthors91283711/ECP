theorem P2012AMCA_5 :
  ∃ (b r g c : ℕ),
    b + r + g + c = 280 ∧
    r = 2 * b ∧
    g = 3 * c ∧
    c = 4 * r ∧
    c = P2012AMCA_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the constraints:
1. r = 2*b
2. g = 3*c
3. c = 4*r
4. b + r + g + c = 280

Substituting (1) and (3) into (2): g = 3*(4*r) = 12*r
Substituting all into (4): b + 2*b + 12*b + 4*(2*b) = 280
Simplify: b + 2b + 12b + 8b = 23b = 280 ⇒ b = 280/23

This suggests the problem might have different constraints. Looking at the enumerated answers, the solution appears to be:
