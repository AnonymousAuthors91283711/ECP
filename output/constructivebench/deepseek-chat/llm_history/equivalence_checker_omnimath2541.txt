Ground Truth Answer: fun n => if n = 2 then 4 else if n = 3 then 6 else 7
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 2 * n - 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal number of triples (subsets of size n) needed to cover all pairs of elements from a set of size 2n.

2. The ground truth answer gives specific values:
   - For n=2: 4
   - For n=3: 6
   - For n>3: 7

3. The proposed answer suggests a linear formula: 2n-1

Comparison:
- For n=2: 2*2-1=3 ≠ 4 (ground truth)
- For n=3: 2*3-1=5 ≠ 6 (ground truth)
- For n=4: 2*4-1=7 = 7 (ground truth)

The proposed answer only matches the ground truth when n>3, and is incorrect for the smaller cases that are explicitly given in the ground truth.
