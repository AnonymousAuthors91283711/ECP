The error occurs because the proposed answer involves noncomputable operations (square roots and division on real numbers). In Lean, we need to mark such definitions as `noncomputable`. The mathematical pattern from the problem suggests that `h` is the average of the roots of two quadratic equations, which explains the form of the answer.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2014AIMEI_6_answer : ℝ := (sqrt (2014 / 2) + sqrt (2013 / 3)) / 2>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem involves two quadratic equations:
   - 3(x - h)² + j = 0 with j = 2013
   - 2(x - h)² + k = 0 with k = 2014
2. Solving each gives roots at h ± sqrt(-j/3) and h ± sqrt(-k/2) respectively
3. The average of the extreme roots (h + sqrt(-j/3) and h + sqrt(-k/2)) would be h + (sqrt(-j/3) + sqrt(-k/2))/2
4. However, since j and k are positive, the equations have no real roots, suggesting the problem might be about complex roots or there might be sign considerations
5. The proposed form matches the pattern of averaging the square root terms, though the exact derivation would need more context[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error occurs because the proposed answer involves real number operations (sqrt and division) which are noncomputable in Lean by default. We need to mark the definition as noncomputable. Based on the problem statement and the proposed answer, we're solving a system of equations involving quadratic forms with given constants j=2013 and k=2014. The answer combines the square roots of these normalized constants in a symmetric way.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2014AIMEI_6_answer : ℝ := (sqrt (2014 / 2) + sqrt (2013 / 3)) / 2>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem involves two quadratic equations with different coefficients (3 and 2) and constants (2013 and 2014)
2. For each equation, the roots are symmetric around h, so h is the average of the roots
3. The distance from h to each root is sqrt(-j/3) and sqrt(-k/2) respectively
4. The proposed answer averages these distances (after normalizing by the coefficients)
5. The noncomputable marker is needed because real number operations aren't computable in Lean's kernel[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
