  P2014AMCA_4_answer a b c d e = (b * d * e) / (a * c) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ → ℕ → ℕ → ℕ → ℚ
Based on the problem statement and the pattern in the enumerated answers, the solution appears to be a simple fraction where the numerator is the product of b, d, e and the denominator is the product of a, c. This matches the given theorem statement.
