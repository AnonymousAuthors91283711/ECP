Ground Truth Answer: 3375
Proposed Answer: 2025
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a unique 4-digit number (1000-9999) where:
   - The square root of the number equals its first digit times the square root of the remaining 3 digits
   - The first digit cannot be zero

2. Ground truth answer is 3375:
   - √3375 ≈ 58.09475
   - First digit is 3, remaining digits form 375
   - 3 × √375 ≈ 3 × 19.3649 ≈ 58.0947 (matches √3375)

3. Proposed answer is 2025:
   - √2025 = 45
   - First digit is 2, remaining digits form 025 (which is 25)
   - 2 × √25 = 2 × 5 = 10 ≠ 45

The proposed answer 2025 does not satisfy the condition in the problem, while the ground truth answer 3375 does. They are not equivalent.
