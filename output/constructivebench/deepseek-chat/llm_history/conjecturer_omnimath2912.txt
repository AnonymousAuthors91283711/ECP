Looking at the constraints and the enumerated answers, the pattern suggests the maximum value occurs when the Fibonacci-like additions use the largest available numbers from the set {1,2,4,5,6,9,10,11,13}. The sequence should maximize the final term by choosing largest possible numbers at each step.

<<<13 + 11 + 9 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 2 + 1>>> 

This sums the largest possible values while maintaining the Fibonacci-like addition constraints. The exact sequence would be f0=13, f2=11, f4=9, f6=6, f8=5 (with intermediate terms following the addition rules), but the greatest value in the set is 13.
