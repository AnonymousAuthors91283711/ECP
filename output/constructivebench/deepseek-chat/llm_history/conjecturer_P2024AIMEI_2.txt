theorem P2024AIMEI_2 :
  ∃ x y : ℝ, 1 < x ∧ 1 < y ∧ logb x (y^x) = 10 ∧ logb y (x^(4*y)) = 10 ∧ x * y = P2024AIMEI_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the problem, we have two logarithmic equations and a product condition. The enumerated answers suggest the solution involves exponents of 10. Analyzing the equations:
1. logb x (y^x) = 10 ⇒ y^x = x^10
2. logb y (x^(4y)) = 10 ⇒ x^(4y) = y^10
Taking natural logs and dividing equations gives y/x = 4y/10 ⇒ x = 5/2. Substituting back gives y = 2^5. Thus x*y = (5/2)*32 = 80.
