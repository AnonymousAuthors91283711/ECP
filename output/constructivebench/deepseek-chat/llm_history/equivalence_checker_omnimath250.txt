Ground Truth Answer: fun m n => if m = 0 then 1 else if n = 0 then 1 else 
    let d := Nat.gcd m n
    let m' := m / d
    let n' := n / d
    if n' = 1 then 1 else m' + n' - 1
Proposed Answer: fun m n => if m = 1 then n else if n = 1 then m else m + n - 1
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. The ground truth answer handles several cases:
   - Special cases when m=0 or n=0 (returns 1)
   - Computes gcd and divides m,n by it
   - Special case when n'=1 (returns 1)
   - Otherwise returns m' + n' - 1

2. The proposed answer:
   - Handles special cases when m=1 or n=1
   - Otherwise returns m + n - 1

The differences are:
- The proposed answer doesn't handle m=0 or n=0 cases (though the theorem states m,n>0)
- The proposed answer doesn't account for the gcd adjustment
- The special cases are different (m=1 vs n'=1)

The proposed answer would only match the ground truth when gcd(m,n)=1 and neither m nor n is 1. This is not generally equivalent.
