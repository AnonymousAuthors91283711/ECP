Based on the problem constraints and pattern recognition from enumeration, the solution appears to be a list with alternating 1s and -1s where the pattern length matches the LCM of the sublist constraints (7 and 11). The most balanced solution would be:

<<<List.replicate 10 1 ++ List.replicate 10 (-1)>>>
