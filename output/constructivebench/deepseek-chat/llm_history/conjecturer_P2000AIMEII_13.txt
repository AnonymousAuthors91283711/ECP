From the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we need to find a natural number that satisfies the conditions involving roots of the polynomial. The key is recognizing that the polynomial has two distinct real roots, and one of them can be expressed in the form (m + √n)/r with specific conditions. The sum m + n + r appears to be the answer.

Looking at the pattern and the polynomial's structure, the simplest solution likely involves n=5 (since √5 often appears in such problems), with m=1 and r=10 (from the polynomial coefficients). This gives 1 + 5 + 10 = 16.
