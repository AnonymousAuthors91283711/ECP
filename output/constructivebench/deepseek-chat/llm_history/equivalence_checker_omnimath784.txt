Ground Truth Answer: 7^7 * 11^7 * 13^7
Proposed Answer: 1007 * 1009 * 1009 * 1009 * 1009 * 1009 * 1009
Let's analyze both answers:

1. Ground Truth: 7^7 * 11^7 * 13^7
   - Calculates to (7*11*13)^7 = 1001^7
   - 1001^7 = (1000+1)^7 which expands to 1007000000000000000000 + other terms
   - This clearly doesn't match the left side of the equation (1007021035035021007001)

2. Proposed Answer: 1007 * 1009^6
   - 1007 * 1009^6 = 1007 * (1000+9)^6
   - This would result in a number much larger than the given 1007021035035021007001

Neither answer actually equals 1007021035035021007001. However, the ground truth is closer in form (being a power of 1001) while the proposed answer is completely different and incorrect.
