<<<(8 * (7 - 2 * y + 3 * z) + y)>>> 

Explanation: From h1, we can express x as (7 - 2y + 3z). Substituting this into the target expression 8x + y gives the closed form solution. The enumerated answers suggest this pattern holds for all real y and z.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error occurs because the proposed answer uses variables `y` and `z` which are not defined in the scope of `omnimath1859_answer`. Since this is a system of linear equations, we need to solve for `x` and `y` in terms that don't depend on the other variables.

Looking at the problem:
1. We have two equations:
   - x + 2y - 3z = 7
   - 2x - y + 2z = 6
2. We need to find 8x + y

The solution approach should be:
1. Solve the system for x and y
2. Express 8x + y in terms that eliminate z

After solving (e.g., by elimination), we find that 8x + y equals 22. This is a constant value that doesn't depend on any variables, which matches the expected type ℝ.

<<<22>>>
