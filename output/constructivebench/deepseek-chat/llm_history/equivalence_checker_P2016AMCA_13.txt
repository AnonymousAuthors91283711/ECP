Ground Truth Answer: 85
Proposed Answer: 60
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest positive multiple of 5 (N % 5 = 0 ∧ N > 0) where P(N) < 321/400, and whose digits sum to 12.

2. The ground truth answer is 85:
   - 85 is a multiple of 5
   - Sum of digits: 8 + 5 = 13 (Note: This actually contradicts the problem statement which requires sum=12)
   - Wait, this suggests there might be an error in either the problem statement or ground truth answer

3. The proposed answer is 60:
   - 60 is a multiple of 5
   - Sum of digits: 6 + 0 = 6 ≠ 12
   - Doesn't satisfy the digit sum condition

Given that:
- Neither answer satisfies the digit sum condition (85 sums to 13, 60 sums to 6)
- The ground truth answer doesn't match its own condition
- The proposed answer is smaller but also doesn't match

However, focusing on the main condition (smallest N where P(N) < 321/400), 60 would come before 85 in the ordering. But since neither satisfies the digit sum condition, and the ground truth seems incorrect, this is problematic.
