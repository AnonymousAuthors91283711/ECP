Looking at the problem statement and the error message, I can see that the proposed answer has several issues:
1. It's trying to use a function when a simple natural number is expected
2. The Nat.find usage is incorrect - it needs an existence proof
3. The problem asks for the minimal n such that 2004 is in S(n)

From the set definition S(n) = {m | m ≥ 1 ∧ ∃ k ≥ 1, m = k*(n+1)}, we need to find the smallest n where 2004 is a multiple of (n+1). This means we need to find the largest proper divisor of 2004 and subtract 1.

The correct approach is to:
1. Find all divisors of 2004
2. Take the largest proper divisor (which would be 2004/2=1002)
3. Subtract 1 to get n

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<1001>>>

Explanation:
- 2004's prime factorization is 2² × 3 × 167
- Its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 167, 334, 501, 668, 1002, 2004
- The largest proper divisor is 1002
- Therefore n = 1002 - 1 = 1001
- This gives S(1001) containing 2004 (when k=2) and is the minimal such n
