noncomputable abbrev omnimath744_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath744 :
  let r0 := 5
  let ratio := 2/3
  let ω := π/6
  let t := 12
  let total_distance := 2 * π * (r0 / (1 - ratio)) * (ω * t / (2 * π))
  total_distance = omnimath744_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
