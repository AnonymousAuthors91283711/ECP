Ground Truth Answer: (505, 1212)
Proposed Answer: (20, 1010)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find a unique pair (p₁, p₂) where:
   - 0 < p₁ < p₂
   - ((2020 - p₁)/p₁) * ((2020 - p₂)/p₂) = 2

2. For Ground Truth (505, 1212):
   - (2020-505)/505 = 1515/505 = 3
   - (2020-1212)/1212 = 808/1212 ≈ 0.6667
   - 3 * 0.6667 ≈ 2 (exact calculation shows it equals exactly 2)

3. For Proposed Answer (20, 1010):
   - (2020-20)/20 = 2000/20 = 100
   - (2020-1010)/1010 = 1010/1010 = 1
   - 100 * 1 = 100 ≠ 2

The proposed answer clearly doesn't satisfy the equation, while the ground truth does. They are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
