abbrev omnimath958_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath958 :
    {x : ℝ | (x ^ 2 + 3 * x + 2) * (x ^ 2 - 7 * x + 12) * (x ^ 2 - 2 * x - 1) + 24 = 0} = omnimath958_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
Looking at the polynomial structure and the enumerated roots, we can see the solutions come from combining roots of the component quadratics. The key insight is that the product evaluates to -24 when x=0,1,3,4, suggesting these are the roots after simplification.
