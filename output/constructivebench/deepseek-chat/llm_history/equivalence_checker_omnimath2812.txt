abbrev omnimath2812_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2812 :
  (let x : ℝ := 2;
   (x + 2 - x) * (2 - x - 2) = omnimath2812_answer) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: -4
Proposed Answer: 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves evaluating the expression `(x + 2 - x) * (2 - x - 2)` where `x = 2`.

2. Simplifying the first parentheses: `x + 2 - x` = `(x - x) + 2` = `0 + 2` = `2`

3. Simplifying the second parentheses: `2 - x - 2` = `(2 - 2) - x` = `0 - 2` = `-2` (since x=2)

4. Multiplying the results: `2 * (-2)` = `-4`

The ground truth answer is correct (-4), while the proposed answer is 0, which is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
