Ground Truth Answer: {r : ℝ | r > 3 ∨ r < 49 / 27}
Proposed Answer: {r : ℝ | r < - (4 * (2 / 27 + 1 / 3 - 1) + 2)}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
We're given a cubic polynomial P(z) = z³ + z² - z + 2 and asked to find all real numbers r such that there exists a non-real complex number z with P(z) = r.

Ground Truth Answer:
{r : ℝ | r > 3 ∨ r < 49/27} - This is the correct range of real outputs for non-real inputs.

Proposed Answer:
{r : ℝ | r < -(4*(2/27 + 1/3 - 1) + 2)} - Let's simplify this:
1. Inside parentheses: 2/27 + 1/3 - 1 = 2/27 + 9/27 - 27/27 = -16/27
2. Multiply by 4: 4*(-16/27) = -64/27
3. Negative sign: -(-64/27) = 64/27
4. Add 2: 64/27 + 2 = 64/27 + 54/27 = 118/27 ≈ 4.37

So the proposed answer simplifies to {r : ℝ | r < 118/27}, which is approximately r < 4.37.

Comparison:
The proposed answer only captures part of the correct solution (the r < 49/27 part, since 118/27 ≈ 4.37 > 49/27 ≈ 1.81), but misses the r > 3 condition entirely.
