Ground Truth Answer: 4018021
Proposed Answer: 2004 * 2004 + 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives a functional equation for a sequence a : ℕ → ℝ with a boundary condition a(1) = 3, and asks for the value of a(2004).

2. The ground truth answer is 4,018,021.

3. The proposed answer is 2004*2004 + 2 = 4,016,016 + 2 = 4,016,018.

4. Comparing the two:
   - Ground truth: 4,018,021
   - Proposed: 4,016,018
   - Difference: 2,003

5. The proposed quadratic formula doesn't match the ground truth value. The correct solution should satisfy the functional equation and boundary condition, leading to a different formula than n² + 2.
