Ground Truth Answer: (62, 2)
Proposed Answer: (62, 6)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a unique pair of natural numbers (p₁, p₂) where:
   - Both p₁ and p₂ are positive
   - They satisfy the equation: (p₁ + p₂ - 1)(p₁ + p₂)/2 - p₁ + 1 = 2015

2. Ground truth answer is (62, 2)
   - Let's verify: (62+2-1)(62+2)/2 - 62 + 1 = (63*64)/2 - 61 = 2016 - 61 = 1955 ≠ 2015
   - Wait, this doesn't seem to satisfy the equation. There might be an error in the ground truth.

3. Proposed answer is (62, 6)
   - Verification: (62+6-1)(62+6)/2 - 62 + 1 = (67*68)/2 - 61 = 2278 - 61 = 2217 ≠ 2015
   - This also doesn't satisfy the equation.

However, let's find the correct solution:
The equation can be rewritten as n(n+1)/2 - p₁ + 1 = 2015 where n = p₁ + p₂ - 1
We need n(n+1)/2 ≈ 2015 ⇒ n ≈ 62.9 ⇒ try n=63
63*64/2 = 2016 ⇒ 2016 - p₁ + 1 = 2015 ⇒ p₁ = 2
Then p₁ + p₂ - 1 = 63 ⇒ 2 + p₂ - 1 = 63 ⇒ p₂ = 62
So the correct answer should be (2, 62), which is the reverse of the ground truth.

Given that:
- Neither (62,2) nor (62,6) satisfy the equation
- The correct answer appears to be (2,62)
- The proposed answer (62,6) is incorrect and not equivalent to the ground truth (62,2)
