Based on the problem constraints (not divisible by 3, not a perfect square, prime digit sum) and typical competition problems, I conjecture the answer is a prime number with these properties. The smallest such number is 2, but since 2 is divisible by 2 and its digit sum is prime (2), let's check 5: digit sum 5 (prime), not divisible by 3, not a square. This fits all conditions.

<<<5>>>
