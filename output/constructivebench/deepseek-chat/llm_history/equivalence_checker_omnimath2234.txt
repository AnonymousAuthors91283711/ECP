Ground Truth Answer: 100
Proposed Answer: 30
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n where:
1. For n, we find the minimal P (defined by 7a+12b) among all (a,b) satisfying 6a+10b=n
2. For n+2, we find the minimal P' (same definition but for n+2)
3. We want the smallest n where P' < P

The ground truth answer is 100, while the proposed answer is 30.

To evaluate:
- For n=30, the minimal P comes from (a,b)=(5,0) giving P=35
- For n=32, the minimal P' comes from (2,2) giving P'=38
But 38 > 35, so P' > P at n=30, which doesn't satisfy the condition P' < P

The actual smallest n where P' < P is indeed 100 (ground truth is correct). At n=100:
- Minimal P comes from (0,10) giving P=120
- For n=102, minimal P' comes from (7,6) giving P'=121, but also (2,9) gives P'=122
Wait, this seems incorrect as 121 < 120 would satisfy P' < P, but 121 is actually greater than 120.

Hmm, this suggests neither answer might be correct, but the ground truth is more likely to be verified by the problem poser. The proposed answer 30 is definitely wrong as shown above.
