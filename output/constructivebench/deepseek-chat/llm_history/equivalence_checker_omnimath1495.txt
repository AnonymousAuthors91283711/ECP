Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => a ^ (logb 2 a) * 2 ^ (b ^ 2)
Proposed Answer: fun a b => 2 ^ (7 / b)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two equations:
   - a * 2^b = 8
   - a^b = 2
   And asks us to find an expression in terms of a and b that equals 128.

2. From the second equation a^b = 2, we can express a as a = 2^(1/b)

3. Substituting this into the first equation:
   2^(1/b) * 2^b = 8 => 2^(1/b + b) = 2^3 => 1/b + b = 3

4. Solving 1/b + b = 3 gives us b^2 - 3b + 1 = 0, but we don't actually need to solve this for the general expression.

5. The ground truth answer is a^(log₂ a) * 2^(b²). Using a = 2^(1/b), this becomes:
   (2^(1/b))^(log₂ (2^(1/b))) * 2^(b²) = (2^(1/b))^(1/b) * 2^(b²) = 2^(1/b²) * 2^(b²) = 2^(1/b² + b²)

6. The proposed answer is 2^(7/b). This is much simpler and doesn't match the ground truth's form.

7. Let's test with a specific solution: b=2 gives a=√2 from a^2=2. Then:
   - Ground truth: (√2)^(log₂ √2) * 2^4 = (√2)^(0.5) * 16 = 2^(0.25)*16 ≈ 19.02 ≠ 128
   - Proposed: 2^(7/2) ≈ 11.31 ≠ 128
   Both fail, but more importantly, they're not equivalent expressions.

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth's form and both fail to satisfy the condition of equaling 128 for valid (a,b) pairs. They are not equivalent.
