Ground Truth Answer: 202
Proposed Answer: 4 * (2014 / 20) + if 2014 % 20 ≥ 1 then 1 else 0 + if 2014 % 20 ≥ 5 then 1 else 0 + if 2014 % 20 ≥ 13 then 1 else 0 + if 2014 % 20 ≥ 17 then 1 else 0
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves counting numbers k from 1 to 2014 where f(k) ≡ 1 mod 10, where f is a combinatorial function.

2. The ground truth answer is 202.

3. The proposed answer is a formula that calculates:
   - 4 * (2014 // 20) as a base count
   - Plus additional counts based on remainders when 2014 is divided by 20

Calculating the proposed answer:
- 2014 ÷ 20 = 100 with remainder 14
- Base count: 4 * 100 = 400
- Remainder checks:
  - 14 ≥ 1 → +1
  - 14 ≥ 5 → +1
  - 14 ≥ 13 → +1
  - 14 ≥ 17 → +0
- Total: 400 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 403

This gives 403, which is very different from the ground truth 202. The proposed formula doesn't match the correct count.
