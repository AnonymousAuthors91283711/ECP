Ground Truth Answer: fun x => (1/2) * Real.sqrt x
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℝ => Real.sqrt (x / 4)
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer is: λ x, (1/2) * √x
The proposed answer is: λ x, √(x/4)

Let's simplify the proposed answer:
√(x/4) = √x / √4 = √x / 2 = (1/2) * √x

This is exactly equal to the ground truth answer. The two expressions are mathematically equivalent, just written in different forms.
