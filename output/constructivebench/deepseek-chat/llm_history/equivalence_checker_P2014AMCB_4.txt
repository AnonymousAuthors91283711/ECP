abbrev P2014AMCB_4_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2014AMCB_4 (m b : ℚ) (hm : m > 0) (hb : b > 0) :
  (4 * m + 3 * b) * 2 = 2 * m + 16 * b ↔ m = P2014AMCB_4_answer * b := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: 5 / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is an equation involving m and b with constraints m > 0 and b > 0.
2. We need to solve (4m + 3b)*2 = 2m + 16b for m in terms of b.
3. Let's solve it step by step:
   - Expand left side: 8m + 6b = 2m + 16b
   - Subtract 2m from both sides: 6m + 6b = 16b
   - Subtract 6b from both sides: 6m = 10b
   - Divide both sides by 6: m = (10/6)b = (5/3)b

The ground truth answer is 2, but the correct solution gives 5/3. The proposed answer is 5/2, which is also incorrect.
