theorem omnimath3490 (n : ℕ) (hn : n = 7) :
  Even (omnimath3490_answer n) ∧

Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 8 * n
Proposed Answer: fun _ : ℕ => 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function `omnimath3490_answer` that takes a natural number `n` and returns another natural number that satisfies certain conditions when `n=7`.

2. The conditions are:
   - The result must be even
   - 9*n must be odd
   - n+8 must be odd
   - n² must be odd
   - n*(n-2) must be odd

3. For n=7:
   - Ground truth (8*n) gives 56, which is even
   - Proposed answer gives 2, which is also even
   - Both satisfy the first condition

4. However, the proposed answer ignores the input `n` completely and always returns 2. While this works for n=7, it wouldn't work for other values of n where the other conditions need to hold. The ground truth answer works for any n where the conditions hold (particularly n=7).

5. The problem specifies the theorem only for n=7, so technically the proposed answer satisfies the given conditions. But it's not a general solution like the ground truth.
