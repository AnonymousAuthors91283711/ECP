theorem P2005AMCA_6 :
  ∃ (t : ℝ), 0 < t ∧
  let josh_speed := (4/5) * (13 / t);
  let mike_speed := 13 / t;
  josh_speed * (2 * t) + mike_speed * t = 13 ∧
  mike_speed * t = P2005AMCA_6_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the problem statement, we can see it's about calculating a distance (Mike's distance) based on speeds and times. The key relationships are:
1. Josh's speed is 4/5 of Mike's speed
2. Total distance covered by both is 13
3. Mike's distance is the answer we need

The enumerated answers suggest the solution is 5. The pattern shows Mike's distance is 5 when total distance is 13.
