theorem P2018AMCA_2 : 
  IsGreatest {v : ℕ | ∃ (a b c : ℕ), 
    a ≤ 20 ∧ b ≤ 20 ∧ c ≤ 20 ∧ 
    5 * a + 4 * b + c ≤ 18 ∧ 
    v = 14 * a + 11 * b + 2 * c} 
  P2018AMCA_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the constraints and objective function, the maximum will occur when we maximize the higher coefficient variables (a first, then b) within the constraints. The enumerated answers suggest the maximum occurs at a=3, b=0, c=3. 

<<<3 * 14 + 0 * 11 + 3 * 2>>>
