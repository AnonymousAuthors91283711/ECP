<<<1200>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks for the count of numbers between 1 and 2000 that are coprime with 2001. Since 2001 factors into 3×23×29, we can use Euler's totient function. The answer is φ(2000) = 2000 × (1-1/2) × (1-1/5) = 800, but we need to adjust for numbers up to 2000 coprime with 2001. The correct count is 2000 × (1-1/3) × (1-1/23) × (1-1/29) = 1200.
