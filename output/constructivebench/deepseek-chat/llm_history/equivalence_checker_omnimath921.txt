Ground Truth Answer: (16^2014 - 14^2014) / 2
Proposed Answer: 2^2015 * (2^2014 - 1)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

The ground truth answer is (16^2014 - 14^2014)/2
The proposed answer is 2^2015 * (2^2014 - 1)

Let's simplify both expressions:

Ground truth:
(16^2014 - 14^2014)/2 = (2^4^2014 - (2*7)^2014)/2 = (2^(4*2014) - 2^2014 * 7^2014)/2
= (2^8056 - 2^2014 * 7^2014)/2 = 2^8055 - 2^2013 * 7^2014

Proposed answer:
2^2015 * (2^2014 - 1) = 2^2015 * 2^2014 - 2^2015 = 2^(2015+2014) - 2^2015 = 2^4029 - 2^2015

These are clearly different expressions. The exponents (8055 vs 4029) and terms are completely different. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth.
