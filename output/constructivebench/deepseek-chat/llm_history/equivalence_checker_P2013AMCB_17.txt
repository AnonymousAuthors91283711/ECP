Ground Truth Answer: 16 / 3
Proposed Answer: 4 * Real.sqrt 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the difference between the supremum and infimum of a set of real numbers c defined by certain constraints on a and b.

2. The constraints are:
   - a + b = 2 - c
   - a² + b² = 12 - c²

3. We can analyze this system:
   - From (a+b)² = a² + b² + 2ab, we get (2-c)² = (12-c²) + 2ab
   - This simplifies to 4 - 4c + c² = 12 - c² + 2ab
   - Further simplification gives 2ab = 2c² - 4c - 8
   - For real solutions to exist, the discriminant must be non-negative: (a+b)² - 4ab ≥ 0
   - Substituting gives (2-c)² - 2(2c²-4c-8) ≥ 0
   - This simplifies to -3c² + 12 ≥ 0 ⇒ c² ≤ 4 ⇒ -2 ≤ c ≤ 2

4. The ground truth answer is 16/3 ≈ 5.333
5. The proposed answer is 4√2 ≈ 5.656

The proposed answer is close but not exactly equal to the ground truth answer. The correct range should be from -2 to 10/3 (since when c=-2, the difference is 16/3), not involving √2 at all.
