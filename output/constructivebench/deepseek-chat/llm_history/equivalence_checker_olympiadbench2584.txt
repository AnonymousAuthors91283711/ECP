Ground Truth Answer: sqrt 6
Proposed Answer: (1 + Real.logb 2 3) / (2 - Real.logb 2 3)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer √6 and the proposed answer (1 + log₂3)/(2 - log₂3).

1. First, let's evaluate the proposed answer numerically:
   - log₂3 ≈ 1.58496
   - Numerator: 1 + 1.58496 ≈ 2.58496
   - Denominator: 2 - 1.58496 ≈ 0.41504
   - Result: 2.58496/0.41504 ≈ 6.228

2. Now evaluate √6:
   - √6 ≈ 2.449

The numerical values are clearly different (6.228 vs 2.449), so the answers cannot be equivalent.

3. The ground truth answer √6 is indeed correct for this problem, as it satisfies the original equation when substituted back. The proposed answer gives a completely different value.
