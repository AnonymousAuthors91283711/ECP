The error occurs because Lean doesn't recognize the set builder notation syntax. In Lean, we need to use `setOf` for defining sets with conditions. The proposed answer is correct mathematically but needs proper Lean syntax.

Explanation:
1. The problem asks for all integer pairs (m,n) where (m²+n)(m+n²) = (m-n)³
2. The solution consists of three families:
   - Pairs where n = -k and m = k
   - Pairs where n = 1-k and m = k
   - Pairs where m = -k² and n = k
3. These correspond to the three cases in the union

Here's the corrected Lean syntax:

<<<setOf (fun (p : ℤ × ℤ) => ∃ k, p = (k, -k) ∨ p = (k, 1 - k) ∨ p = (-k^2, k))>>>

This uses `setOf` to define the set and properly quantifies over k using `∃`. The three cases are combined with logical OR (`∨`) instead of set union. This should compile correctly in Lean while maintaining the same mathematical meaning.
