Ground Truth Answer: 9 / sqrt 23
Proposed Answer: 2 * Real.sqrt 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the unique triple (a, b, c) of positive real numbers satisfying:
   - A system of equations relating their squares
   - A product-sum condition: ab + bc + ca = 1
   - The sum a + b + c equals some value (which we're trying to find)

2. The ground truth answer is 9/√23 ≈ 1.876
3. The proposed answer is 2√2 ≈ 2.828

The two answers are numerically quite different (1.876 vs 2.828), and there's no obvious algebraic manipulation that would make them equivalent. 

Let's verify the proposed answer can't be correct:
- If the sum were 2√2, then squaring would give (a+b+c)² = 8
- But from ab+bc+ca = 1, we'd have a²+b²+c² = 8 - 2 = 6
- However, the first three equations impose constraints on a², b², c² that would make this impossible

<<<False>>>
