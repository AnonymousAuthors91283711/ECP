Ground Truth Answer: fun n => ∃ k, n.divisors.card = 2^k
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => ∃ k : ℕ, n = 2^k ∨ (∃ p : ℕ, Nat.Prime p ∧ 2^k - 1 = p ∧ n = 2^(k-1) * p)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem: We're looking for numbers n where the sum of their divisors equals 2^m for some m. The condition is given for n > 0.

Ground Truth Answer: Numbers where the count of divisors is a power of 2 (i.e., divisor count = 2^k).

Proposed Answer: Numbers that are either:
1. Powers of 2 (n = 2^k), or
2. Numbers of the form 2^(k-1)*p where p is a prime and 2^k-1 is prime (Mersenne primes)

Analysis:
- For powers of 2 (n=2^k), both answers agree as they have exactly k+1 divisors (which is a power of 2).
- For numbers of form 2^(k-1)*p where p is Mersenne prime, these are even perfect numbers. Their divisor count is indeed a power of 2 (specifically 2k when p=2^k-1 is prime).
- However, the ground truth answer would also include numbers with other forms where the divisor count is a power of 2 (like products of distinct Fermat primes), which the proposed answer doesn't cover.

Conclusion: The proposed answer is a subset of the ground truth answer, but doesn't cover all cases where the divisor count is a power of 2.
