Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: 3
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves summing terms of the form 2^(k*(k+1)/2) modulo 7 for k from 0 to 2010.

2. The key observation is that powers of 2 modulo 7 cycle every 3 exponents since φ(7)=6 and 2^3 ≡ 1 mod 7 (since 8 ≡ 1 mod 7).

3. The exponent k*(k+1)/2 is the k-th triangular number. We need to examine these triangular numbers modulo 3 since the cycle length is 3.

4. Looking at triangular numbers modulo 3:
   - k ≡ 0 mod 3: T(k) ≡ 0 mod 3
   - k ≡ 1 mod 3: T(k) ≡ 1 mod 3
   - k ≡ 2 mod 3: T(k) ≡ 0 mod 3

5. Therefore, the powers of 2 modulo 7 will be:
   - 2^0 ≡ 1 when k ≡ 0 or 2 mod 3
   - 2^1 ≡ 2 when k ≡ 1 mod 3

6. In each complete cycle of 3 numbers, we get contributions of 1 (k≡0), 2 (k≡1), and 1 (k≡2), totaling 4 per cycle.

7. 2011 numbers means 670 full cycles (3×670=2010) plus 1 extra term (k=2010).

8. The total sum would be 670×4 + 1 (for k=2010) = 2681 ≡ 2681 mod 7.

9. Calculating 2681 ÷ 7 = 383 exactly, so remainder is 0, but we have an error here because 670×4=2680, plus 1 is 2681, and 2681 mod 7 is actually 2681 - 7×383=2681-2681=0.

Wait, this contradicts both answers. However, looking back:

The ground truth answer is 1, while the proposed answer is 3. My calculation suggests 0, which means I must have made a mistake.

Re-evaluating:
- For k=2010: 2010 ≡ 0 mod 3, so T(2010) ≡ 0 mod 3 → 2^0 ≡ 1 mod 7
- Total sum should be 670×4 + 1 = 2681
- 2681 ÷ 7 = 383 with remainder 0

But 383×7=2681, so remainder is indeed 0. This contradicts both given answers. However, the ground truth answer is more likely to be correct than the proposed one.

Given that both answers (1 and 3) differ from my calculation of 0, and the ground truth is more likely correct, the proposed answer of 3 is incorrect.
