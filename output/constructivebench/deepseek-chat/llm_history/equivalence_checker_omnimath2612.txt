Ground Truth Answer: 3240
Proposed Answer: Nat.choose 10 3 * 4^3
Let me analyze this problem and the proposed answer.

The problem is asking for the number of pairs of subsets (S, T) of a 10-element set where the union S ∪ T has exactly 3 elements.

The proposed answer is:
Nat.choose 10 3 * 4^3 = C(10,3) * 64 = 120 * 64 = 7680

But the ground truth answer is 3240.

Let's think about the correct counting:
1. First choose 3 elements that will be in the union (C(10,3) ways)
2. For each of these 3 elements, it can be:
   - Only in S
   - Only in T
   - In both S and T
   - In neither (but this would contradict it being in the union)
   
So actually for each element, there are 3 possibilities, not 4. Therefore it should be C(10,3) * 3^3 = 120 * 27 = 3240.

The proposed answer incorrectly counts the possibilities for each element as 4 instead of 3.
