Looking at the problem, we need pairs (a,b) where:
1. 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 60
2. a divides b (b % a = 0)
3. a+1 divides b+1 ((b+1) % (a+1) = 0)

The enumerated answer suggests the count is 105. The pattern comes from counting all pairs where b = k*a and b+1 = m*(a+1), which leads to solutions when a and a+1 are coprime.

<<<105>>>
