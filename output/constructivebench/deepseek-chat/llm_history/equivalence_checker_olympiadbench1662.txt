Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 3 * n
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 3 * n - 2
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is very close to the ground truth but differs by a constant term (-2). The problem asks for the minimal number of planes needed to cover all non-zero lattice points in a cube of side length n. The correct answer should be 3n (as in the ground truth), as we need n planes for each coordinate direction (x, y, z). The proposed answer of 3n-2 undercounts by 2 planes, likely missing some edge cases. The difference becomes particularly noticeable for small values of n (e.g., n=2 would give 4 instead of 6).
