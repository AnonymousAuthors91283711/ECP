Ground Truth Answer: {n | Odd n ∨ ∃ k, n = 2^k}
Proposed Answer: {n | ¬(n ∣ 2)}
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground Truth: {n | Odd n ∨ ∃ k, n = 2^k}
- This includes all odd numbers and powers of 2

Proposed Answer: {n | ¬(n ∣ 2)}
- This means "n does not divide 2", which is equivalent to n ≠ 1 and n ≠ 2

Comparison:
1. For n=1: Ground truth includes it (odd), proposed excludes it (1 divides 2)
2. For n=2: Ground truth includes it (2=2^1), proposed excludes it (2 divides 2)
3. For n=3: Both include it (odd)
4. For n=4: Ground truth includes it (4=2^2), proposed includes it (4 doesn't divide 2)
5. For n=6: Ground truth excludes it (not odd nor power of 2), proposed includes it (6 doesn't divide 2)

The answers are clearly different as they disagree on several cases (1, 2, 6, etc.).
