Ground Truth Answer: {2^(-2/3 : ℝ), 8}
Proposed Answer: {1/8, 64}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation is: (log x / log 4) - (log 16 / log x) = 7/6 - (log 8 / log x)

2. Let's simplify:
   - log 4 = 2 log 2
   - log 16 = 4 log 2
   - log 8 = 3 log 2

3. Substitute these into the equation:
   (log x)/(2 log 2) - (4 log 2)/(log x) = 7/6 - (3 log 2)/(log x)

4. Let y = (log x)/(log 2) ⇒ log x = y log 2

5. Substitute:
   y/2 - 4/y = 7/6 - 3/y

6. Multiply through by 6y:
   3y² - 24 = 7y - 18

7. Rearrange:
   3y² - 7y - 6 = 0

8. Solve quadratic:
   y = [7 ± √(49 + 72)]/6 = [7 ± 11]/6 ⇒ y = 3 or y = -2/3

9. Recall y = log₂x:
   - For y=3: x=2³=8
   - For y=-2/3: x=2^(-2/3)

The ground truth answer {2^(-2/3), 8} matches exactly with our solution. The proposed answer {1/8, 64} is incorrect because:
- 1/8 would correspond to y=-3 (not in our solution)
- 64 would correspond to y=6 (not in our solution)

<<<False>>>
