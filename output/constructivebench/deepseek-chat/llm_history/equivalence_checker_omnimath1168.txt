Ground Truth Answer: 4002
Proposed Answer: (2002 * 2003 - 2) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive function f(n) where:
   - f(2) = 2
   - f(n+3) = (n+3) + (1/2)*f(n+2) for n ≥ 0

2. We're asked to find f(2002)

3. The ground truth answer is 4002

4. The proposed answer is (2002*2003 - 2)/2 = (2002*2003)/2 - 1 = 2004006/2 - 1 = 1002003 - 1 = 1002002

Now let's compute some small values to see the pattern:
f(2) = 2
f(3) = 3 + (1/2)*f(2) = 3 + 1 = 4
f(4) = 4 + (1/2)*f(3) = 4 + 2 = 6
f(5) = 5 + (1/2)*f(4) = 5 + 3 = 8
We can see the pattern f(n) = 2n - 2, so f(2002) = 2*2002 - 2 = 4004 - 2 = 4002

The proposed answer (1002002) is much larger than the correct answer (4002), and doesn't match the pattern we observed in small cases.
