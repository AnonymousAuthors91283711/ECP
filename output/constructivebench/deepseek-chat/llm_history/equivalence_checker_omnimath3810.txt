Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, k) | k > 0} ∪ {(k, 1) | k > 0} ∪ {(2, 2)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation is x³y + x + y = xy + 2xy²
2. Ground truth gives specific solutions: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2)
3. Proposed answer gives:
   - All pairs (1,k) for k>0
   - All pairs (k,1) for k>0
   - Plus (2,2)

Testing the ground truth solutions:
- (0,0): 0+0+0 = 0+0 → valid
- (1,1): 1+1+1 = 1+2 → 3=3 → valid
- (2,2): 16+2+2 = 4+16 → 20=20 → valid

Testing proposed answer:
- (1,k): 1³k+1+k = 1*k+2*1*k² → k+1+k = k+2k² → 2k+1 = k+2k² → 2k²-k-1=0 → Only true when k=1 (solution k=-1/2 invalid for ℕ)
- (k,1): k³*1+k+1 = k*1+2*k*1² → k³+k+1 = k+2k → k³+k+1=3k → k³-2k+1=0 → Only true when k=1 (other roots not natural numbers)
- (2,2): valid as shown above

The proposed answer incorrectly includes all (1,k) and (k,1) for k>0, when only (1,1) works. It's missing (0,0).
