Looking at the pattern of polynomials A that satisfy the condition, we notice they must have roots at x=-10 and x=0 to avoid division by zero in the given equation. The simplest polynomial satisfying this is A = X(X+10). Evaluating at x=10 gives 10*(10+10) = 200. The enumerated answers confirm this is the only solution.

<<<200>>>
