Ground Truth Answer: 2 / 4025
Proposed Answer: 2 / (2 * 2012 + 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence where:
   - a₀ = 2
   - aₙ₊₁ = aₙ / (1 + aₙ)

2. The ground truth answer is 2/4025

3. The proposed answer is 2/(2*2012 + 1) = 2/4025

The two answers are mathematically identical since 2*2012 + 1 = 4025. 

To verify the correctness of the answer itself:
- We can compute the first few terms:
  a₀ = 2
  a₁ = 2/3
  a₂ = (2/3)/(5/3) = 2/5
  a₃ = (2/5)/(7/5) = 2/7
- We observe the pattern aₙ = 2/(2n + 1)
- For n=2012, this gives 2/(2*2012 + 1) = 2/4025
