Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: 6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the tens digit (i.e., (min_num/10)%10) of the smallest number ≥100000 that's divisible by all integers from 10 to 15.

2. First, we need to find the LCM of numbers 10 through 15:
   - LCM(10,11,12,13,14,15) = LCM(LCM(LCM(LCM(LCM(10,11),12),13),14),15)
   - This calculates to 60060

3. The smallest number ≥100000 that's a multiple of 60060 is:
   - ceil(100000/60060)*60060 = 2*60060 = 120120

4. Now we need (120120/10)%10 = (12012)%10 = 2

The ground truth answer is 2, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 6, which is incorrect.
