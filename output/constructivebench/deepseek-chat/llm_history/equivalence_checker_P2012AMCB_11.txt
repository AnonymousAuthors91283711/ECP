Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find natural numbers A and B where:
   - B = A + 1
   - The equation B² + 2B + 3 = A² + 2A + 3 holds
   - We want the minimal possible sum A + B

2. Simplifying the equation:
   B² + 2B = A² + 2A
   (A+1)² + 2(A+1) = A² + 2A
   A² + 2A + 1 + 2A + 2 = A² + 2A
   4A + 3 = 2A
   2A = -3
   A = -1.5

3. However, A must be a natural number (ℕ), so there's no solution in natural numbers.

4. The ground truth answer is 13, which doesn't make sense as there's no solution. The proposed answer is 5, which also doesn't make sense.

Both answers are incorrect as there's no solution in natural numbers. However, since the problem asks for a minimal sum and neither answer is correct, they're not equivalent.
