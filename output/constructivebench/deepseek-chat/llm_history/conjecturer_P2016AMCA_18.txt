abbrev P2016AMCA_18_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2016AMCA_18 (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) 
  (h : (sigma 0 (110 * n^3)) = 110) : 
  (sigma 0 (81 * n^4)) = P2016AMCA_18_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the problem and the enumerated answers, the key observation is that when n=1, both conditions are satisfied (sigma 0 (110*1^3) = 110 and sigma 0 (81*1^4) = 5). The answer seems to be constant regardless of n.
