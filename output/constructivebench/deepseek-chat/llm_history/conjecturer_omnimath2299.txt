Looking at the problem, it's about finding the largest sum s where a subset S of {1,...,12} cannot be partitioned into k equal-sum subsets for any k ≥ 2. The enumerated answers suggest the maximal sum is achieved by taking the largest possible numbers that can't be evenly divided. The answer is likely the sum of numbers from 7 to 12, as this sum (57) is prime and thus can't be partitioned into equal sums.
