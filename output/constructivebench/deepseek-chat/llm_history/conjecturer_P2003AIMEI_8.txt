theorem P2003AIMEI_8 :
  ∃ (a b c d : ℕ),
    0 < a ∧ a < b ∧ b < c ∧ c < d ∧
    2 * b = a + c ∧
    c^2 = b * d ∧
    d - a = 30 ∧
    a + b + c + d = P2003AIMEI_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the constraints and enumerated patterns, the solution involves finding four numbers in arithmetic progression with additional conditions. The key is recognizing this forms a geometric progression with common ratio 3/2. The sum a+b+c+d can be derived as 4a + 30 = 90 when a=15.

<<<90>>>
