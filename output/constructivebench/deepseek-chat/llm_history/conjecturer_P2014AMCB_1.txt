theorem P2014AMCB_1 :
  ∃ p n : ℕ,
    p + n = 13 ∧
    n + 1 = p ∧
    p + 5 * n = P2014AMCB_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the problem constraints:
1. p + n = 13
2. n + 1 = p

Substituting (2) into (1): (n + 1) + n = 13 → 2n = 12 → n = 6
Then p = n + 1 = 7

Final expression: p + 5*n = 7 + 5*6 = 37
