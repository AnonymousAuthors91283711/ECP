Ground Truth Answer: X ^ 2 - 5
Proposed Answer: (-3) * X ^ 2 + 14 * X - 15
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives a polynomial P with specific evaluations at x=1,2,3 and asks for P modulo (X^3 - 6X^2 + 11X - 6).

2. The modulus polynomial factors as (X-1)(X-2)(X-3), so we're looking for a remainder of degree <3 that matches P at these points.

3. The ground truth answer X^2 - 5 evaluates to:
   - At x=1: 1 - 5 = -4 ✔
   - At x=2: 4 - 5 = -1 ✔
   - At x=3: 9 - 5 = 4 ✔

4. The proposed answer (-3)X^2 + 14X - 15 evaluates to:
   - At x=1: -3 + 14 - 15 = -4 ✔
   - At x=2: -12 + 28 - 15 = 1 ✖ (should be -1)
   - At x=3: -27 + 42 - 15 = 0 ✖ (should be 4)

The proposed answer fails to satisfy two of the three given conditions, while the ground truth satisfies all. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
