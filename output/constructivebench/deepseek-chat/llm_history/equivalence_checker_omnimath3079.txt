Ground Truth Answer: 52
Proposed Answer: 99
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find the last two digits (mod 100) of the expression 4¹²⁷ + 5¹²⁹ + 7¹³¹.

2. Ground truth answer is 52, meaning the expression ≡ 52 mod 100.

3. Proposed answer is 99, meaning the expression ≡ 99 mod 100.

To check equivalence:
- We can compute each term modulo 100 separately:
  - 4¹²⁷ mod 100: Since φ(100)=40, and 4 and 100 aren't coprime, but 4²⁰ ≡ 0 mod 100 for n≥2, so 4¹²⁷ ≡ 0 mod 100
  - 5¹²⁹ mod 100: Similarly, 5ⁿ ≡ 25 mod 100 for n≥2
  - 7¹³¹ mod 100: φ(100)=40, so 7⁴⁰ ≡ 1 mod 100. 131 mod 40 = 11, so 7¹³¹ ≡ 7¹¹ mod 100. Calculating 7¹¹ gives 43 mod 100.

Adding them: 0 + 25 + 43 = 68 mod 100, but this contradicts both answers. However, the ground truth is claimed to be 52, which suggests there might be a different calculation method.

The proposed answer (99) is clearly different from the ground truth (52), and neither matches our quick calculation. However, since the ground truth is given as authoritative, we must conclude the proposed answer is incorrect.
