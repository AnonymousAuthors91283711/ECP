Ground Truth Answer: fun k n => n * (3 * k)
Proposed Answer: fun k n => if k = 1 then 2 * n else if n = 1 then k + 1 else k + 2 * n - 1
Let me analyze the problem and compare the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number m such that there exists a function f from Fin m to subsets of Fin(2n) where:
   - Each f(i) has exactly 2 elements
   - For any subset of size k+1, there exists two distinct elements whose images under f are not disjoint

2. The ground truth answer is m = n * (3 * k)

3. The proposed answer has special cases:
   - When k=1: m=2n
   - When n=1: m=k+1
   - Otherwise: m=k+2n-1

Comparison:
- For k=1, n=1: ground truth gives 3, proposed gives 2 (k+1=2) → mismatch
- For k=2, n=1: ground truth gives 6, proposed gives 3 (k+1=3) → mismatch
- For k=1, n=2: ground truth gives 6, proposed gives 4 → mismatch
- For k=2, n=2: ground truth gives 12, proposed gives 5 → mismatch

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth in any non-trivial case. The ground truth shows a multiplicative relationship (n * 3k) while the proposed answer shows an additive relationship (k + 2n -1).
