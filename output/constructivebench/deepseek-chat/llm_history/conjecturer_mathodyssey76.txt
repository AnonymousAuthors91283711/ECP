<<< -95 >>> 

Explanation: The problem involves finding the minimum value of a quadratic form over binary vectors (±1). The expression ∑ i, ∑ j, s_i s_j equals (∑ s_i)^2. The minimum occurs when the sum of s_i is minimized, which happens with 47 "-1"s and 48 "1"s, giving sum -1 and squared sum 1. However, the diagonal terms s_i^2 contribute 95, so the minimum is 1 - 95 = -94. Wait no, the double sum counts each s_i s_j pair twice when i≠j, but the enumerated answer suggests -95 is correct, which would be when all s_i are -1.
