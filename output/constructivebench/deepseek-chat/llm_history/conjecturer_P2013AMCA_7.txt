theorem P2013AMCA_7 :
  ∃ (S : ℕ → ℕ), (∀ n ≥ 3, S n = S (n-1) + S (n-2)) ∧ S 9 = 110 ∧ S 7 = 42 ∧ S 4 = P2013AMCA_7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the recurrence relation S(n) = S(n-1) + S(n-2) for n ≥ 3, this is the Fibonacci sequence. Given S(9)=110 and S(7)=42, we can work backwards to find S(4). The Fibonacci sequence starting with S(1)=10, S(2)=16 gives the required values. Thus S(4)=26.

<<<26>>>
