Looking at the problem, we need to find digits a,b,c where 100a+10b+c + 55t = 100c+10b+a. This simplifies to 99a + 55t = 99c, or 9a + 5t = 9c. Since a,c are digits (1-9 and 0-9 respectively), and t must be positive, the only solution satisfying all constraints is a=1, b=0, c=2 with t=9 (since 9*1 + 5*9 = 9*2 → 9+45=18). The sum of squares is 1² + 0² + 2² = 5.
