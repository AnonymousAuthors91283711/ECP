Ground Truth Answer: 15/64
Proposed Answer: 1 - (105/120)^2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the probability that two independent uniform random variables X,Y in [0,120] satisfy |X-Y| ≤ 15.

2. The ground truth answer is 15/64 ≈ 0.234375.

3. The proposed answer is 1 - (105/120)^2 = 1 - (7/8)^2 = 1 - 49/64 = 15/64.

The proposed answer is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth answer, just expressed in a different form. Both simplify to the same value.
