Looking at the problem, we need to find a number n between 1 and 999 where the number of proper divisors (divisors excluding n itself) is exactly 29. The number of proper divisors is one less than the total number of divisors (since we exclude n). 

A number with 30 total divisors would satisfy this condition. The smallest number with exactly 30 divisors is 720 (since 30 = 2×3×5 and 720 = 2⁴×3²×5¹, giving (4+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 30 divisors).

<<<720>>>
