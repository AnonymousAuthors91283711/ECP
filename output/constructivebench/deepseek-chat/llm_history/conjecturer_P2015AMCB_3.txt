theorem P2015AMCB_3 (a b : ℕ) (h : (2 * a + 3 * b = 100 ∨ 3 * a + 2 * b = 100) ∧ (a = 28 ∨ b = 28)) :
  P2015AMCB_3_answer (a, b) = 8 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ → ℕ
From the problem statement and enumerated answers, we can see that the function needs to return 8 when either:
1. 2a + 3b = 100 and (a=28 or b=28), or
2. 3a + 2b = 100 and (a=28 or b=28)

The solution should pattern match on these conditions. Here's the answer:

<<<fun (a, b) => if (2*a + 3*b = 100 ∨ 3*a + 2*b = 100) ∧ (a = 28 ∨ b = 28) then 8 else 0>>>
