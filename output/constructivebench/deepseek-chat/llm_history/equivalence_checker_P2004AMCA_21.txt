Ground Truth Answer: fun θ => 3/5
Proposed Answer: fun θ => 23/25
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives an infinite series sum of (cos θ)^(2n) from n=0 to ∞ equals 5.

2. This is a geometric series with first term 1 (when n=0) and common ratio (cos θ)^2.

3. The sum of an infinite geometric series is 1/(1 - r), where |r| < 1.

4. So we have: 1/(1 - (cos θ)^2) = 5 → (cos θ)^2 = 4/5.

5. We need to find cos(2θ), which equals 2(cos θ)^2 - 1 by the double angle formula.

6. Substituting: 2*(4/5) - 1 = 8/5 - 5/5 = 3/5.

The ground truth answer (3/5) matches this calculation exactly. The proposed answer (23/25) does not match this result.
