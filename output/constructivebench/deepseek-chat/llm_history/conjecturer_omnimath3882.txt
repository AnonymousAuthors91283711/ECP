Looking at the error message, the issue is with the set membership syntax in Lean. The problem occurs because Lean needs explicit type annotations for the set elements. Here's the corrected version:

<<<{n : ℕ | n % 6 = 1 ∨ n % 6 = 2 ∨ n % 6 = 3 ∨ n % 6 = 5}>>>

Explanation:
1. The error occurs because Lean needs explicit type information when checking set membership.
2. Instead of using `∈ {1, 2, 3, 5}`, we explicitly write out the conditions with `∨` (logical OR).
3. The mathematical meaning remains the same - we're looking for numbers where n mod 6 is 1, 2, 3, or 5.
4. This pattern matches the problem's requirement about divisibility of m² + 9 by 2ⁿ - 1, as these residue classes correspond to cases where 2ⁿ - 1 doesn't have certain small prime factors that would prevent the existence of such m.

The corrected version avoids the metavariable issue by being more explicit about the type and conditions.
