Ground Truth Answer: {0}
Proposed Answer: {Polynomial.C 0, Polynomial.C 1, Polynomial.X ^ 2 + 1}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all real polynomials P where for all x≠0, P(x)² + P(1/x)² = P(x²)*P(1/x²).

2. Ground truth answer is {0} (just the zero polynomial).

3. Proposed answer includes three polynomials: 0, 1, and x²+1.

Testing the proposed polynomials:
- For P=0: Works (0+0=0*0)
- For P=1: Works (1+1=1*1)
- For P=x²+1:
  Let's test x=1: (1+1)² + (1+1)² = 8 vs (1+1)*(1+1) = 4 → Doesn't work

The proposed answer incorrectly includes x²+1, and while it correctly includes 0 and 1, the presence of the incorrect polynomial makes the answer wrong.
