Ground Truth Answer: 9 / (16 * Real.sqrt 2)
Proposed Answer: 1 / (2 * Real.sqrt 2)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

The problem is asking for the least constant M such that the given inequality holds for all real numbers a, b, c. The inequality involves a cyclic symmetric expression in a, b, c.

The ground truth answer is 9/(16√2) ≈ 0.3977
The proposed answer is 1/(2√2) ≈ 0.3535

These are clearly different numerical values. The proposed answer is smaller than the ground truth answer, which means it cannot satisfy the inequality for all real a, b, c (since the ground truth is already the least such constant).

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
