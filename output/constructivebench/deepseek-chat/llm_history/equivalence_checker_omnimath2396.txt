: {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∃ A B : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ, Nontrivial (Invertible A) ∧ Nontrivial (Invertible B) ∧ A * B - B * A = B ^ 2 * A} = omnimath2396_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | Even n}
Proposed Answer: {n | 2 ≤ n}
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding natural numbers n where there exist nontrivial invertible matrices A and B satisfying A*B - B*A = B²*A.

2. The ground truth answer claims this holds for all even natural numbers.

3. The proposed answer claims this holds for all natural numbers ≥ 2.

Key observations:
- The proposed answer is strictly larger than the ground truth answer (includes odd numbers ≥ 3)
- The ground truth is more precise (only even numbers work)
- The proposed answer is correct in that all even numbers ≥ 2 are included, but incorrect in including odd numbers

The proposed answer captures part of the truth (all even n ≥ 2 work) but is too broad (includes odd n which shouldn't work). Therefore:
