theorem omnimath629 (n : ℕ) :
  let Sn := Icc 1 n
  let T := { (A, B, C) : Set Sn × Set Sn × Set Sn | A ⊆ B ∧ (Sn \ A) ⊆ C }
  Nat.card T = omnimath629_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun n : ℕ => 3^n>>> 

Explanation: The problem counts triples (A,B,C) where A ⊆ B and (Sn \ A) ⊆ C. For each element in Sn, it has 3 independent choices: be in A (forcing inclusion in B), be in C, or be in neither. This gives 3^n total combinations. The enumerated answers match this pattern (3^1=3, 3^2=9, etc.).
