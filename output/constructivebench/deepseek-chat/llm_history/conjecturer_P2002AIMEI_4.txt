  ∃! (pair : ℕ × ℕ), 0 < pair.1 ∧ pair.1 < pair.2 ∧
    ∑ k in Finset.Icc pair.1 (pair.2-1), (1 : ℚ)/(k^2 + k) = 1/29 ∧
    pair.1 + pair.2 = P2002AIMEI_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern in the problem (sum of reciprocals of k²+k from a to b-1 equals 1/29, with a < b), this resembles telescoping series where 1/(k²+k) = 1/k - 1/(k+1). The sum telescopes to 1/a - 1/b = 1/29. Solving 1/a - 1/b = 1/29 with a < b gives a=28, b=29*28=812. Thus a+b=840.

<<<840>>>
