Ground Truth Answer: cos (π / 180) / (sin (π / 180))^2
Proposed Answer: (1 / (sin (π / 180))) * tan (π * 89 / 180)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

First, let's recall some trigonometric identities:
1. tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x)
2. 1/sin(x) = csc(x)
3. sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x)

The proposed answer is: (1 / sin(π/180)) * tan(π*89/180)
This can be rewritten using identity 1 as: csc(π/180) * (sin(π*89/180)/cos(π*89/180))

The ground truth answer is: cos(π/180) / (sin(π/180))^2
This can be rewritten as: cot(π/180) * csc(π/180)

Now let's examine if these are equivalent:
The proposed answer involves tan(89π/180) while the ground truth doesn't have this term. For these to be equivalent, we'd need:
tan(89π/180) = cot(π/180)*cos(π/180)

But tan(89π/180) = tan(π/2 - π/180) = cot(π/180) by the co-function identity.

So the proposed answer becomes: csc(π/180)*cot(π/180)
While the ground truth is: cot(π/180)*csc(π/180)

These are identical since multiplication is commutative. Therefore, the answers are equivalent.
