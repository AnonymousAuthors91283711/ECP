theorem omnimath870 : 
  let total_outcomes := 6^4
  let favorable_outcomes := 4^4 - 3^4 - (5^4 - 4^4)

Ground Truth Answer: 175 / 1296
Proposed Answer: 7 / 72
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating a probability where:
   - Total outcomes = 6^4 = 1296
   - Favorable outcomes = 4^4 - 3^4 - (5^4 - 4^4) = 256 - 81 - (625 - 256) = 256 - 81 - 369 = -194 (which doesn't make sense)

2. The ground truth answer is 175/1296 ≈ 0.1350
3. The proposed answer is 7/72 ≈ 0.0972

The calculation of favorable outcomes seems incorrect (negative value), but the ground truth answer matches what would be correct for a different combinatorial problem (probably counting outcomes where exactly two distinct numbers appear in four dice rolls).

The proposed answer (7/72) is not equivalent to the ground truth (175/1296), as:
7/72 = 126/1296 ≠ 175/1296
