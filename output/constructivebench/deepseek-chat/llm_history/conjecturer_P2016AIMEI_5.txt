abbrev P2016AIMEI_5_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2016AIMEI_5 :
  ∃ (n t k : ℕ),
    0 < n ∧ 0 < t ∧
    n + k = 374 ∧
    (2 * t + k) * (k + 1) / 2 = 319 ∧
    n + t = P2016AIMEI_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the problem constraints and enumerated patterns, we can deduce that n + t should be 272. The solution involves solving the system of equations derived from the given conditions.

<<<272>>>
