Ground Truth Answer: 8093
Proposed Answer: 2023 * (2023 + 1) / 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the sum of all natural numbers n where:
   - After 2022 iterations of subtracting the smallest prime factor, the result is prime
   - But after 2021 iterations, the result is not prime
   - All numbers n must be positive

2. The ground truth answer is 8093, which is a specific number.

3. The proposed answer is 2023*(2023+1)/2, which simplifies to the 2023rd triangular number (2023*2024/2 = 2047276).

4. These two answers are vastly different (8093 vs 2047276). The proposed answer appears to be a completely different formula unrelated to the problem's requirements.

5. There's no mathematical justification for why the sum would equal the 2023rd triangular number in this context.
