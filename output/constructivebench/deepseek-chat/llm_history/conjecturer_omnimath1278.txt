(f : ℚ → ℚ)
(hf : ∀ x : ℚ, x ≠ 0 → 3 * f (1/x) + 2 * f x / x = x^2)
: f (-2) = omnimath1278_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
From the functional equation and pattern from enumeration, the solution appears to be a rational number. The key is to solve for f(-2) by substituting x=-1/2 and x=-2 into the equation and solving the system. The final answer is:

<<<(-4)/3>>>
