Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n - 1) * (-1) + (if n % 2 = 0 then 0 else (-1)^((n - 1) / 2))
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (n - 2) * (n - 3) * (n - 4) / 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for two sequences a(n) and g(n) with specific recurrence relations and initial conditions. The combined sequence (a + g) must satisfy given values at n=1,2,3,4 and have a particular form at n=10.

2. The ground truth answer provides a closed-form solution for (a + g)(n) that:
   - Has a linear term (n-1)*(-1)
   - Has a periodic term based on parity (n%2)
   - Includes an alternating sign pattern for odd n

3. The proposed answer is a cubic polynomial divided by 2. Let's evaluate it:
   - At n=1: (1-2)(1-3)(1-4)/2 = (-1)(-2)(-3)/2 = -6/2 = -3 (should be 0 per a1+g1=0)
   - At n=2: 0 (correct)
   - At n=3: (1)(0)(-1)/2 = 0 (should be 1)
   - At n=4: 0 (correct)

The proposed answer fails to match the required values at n=1 and n=3, and its polynomial form doesn't match the ground truth's piecewise definition.
