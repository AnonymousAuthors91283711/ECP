Ground Truth Answer: {12, 15, 18}
Proposed Answer: {n | n % 9 = 0} ∩ {12, 15, 18}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but includes an unnecessary intersection with `{n | n % 9 = 0}`. Since all elements in `{12, 15, 18}` already satisfy `n % 9 = 0` (12%9=3≠0 is false, but 15%9=6≠0 and 18%9=0), this makes the proposed answer incorrect for n=12. The ground truth answer is exactly `{12, 15, 18}` without any additional constraints.
