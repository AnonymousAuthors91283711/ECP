Ground Truth Answer: 6507
Proposed Answer: 5734
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a system of 3 equations with 4 variables (a,b,c,d), each constrained to be digits (0-9).

2. The equations are:
   - 6a + 9b + 3c + d = 88
   - a - b + c - d = -6
   - a - 9b + 3c - d = -46

3. We can solve this system step by step:
   - Subtract equation 2 from equation 3: (a-9b+3c-d) - (a-b+c-d) = -46 - (-6) → -8b + 2c = -40 → -4b + c = -20 → c = 4b - 20
   - From equation 2: a + c = b + d - 6
   - Substitute c into equation 1: 6a + 9b + 3(4b-20) + d = 88 → 6a + 21b + d = 148
   - From c = 4b - 20 and 0 ≤ c ≤ 9, we get b must be 5 (since b=6 makes c=4, b=7 makes c=8, other values make c out of range)
   - With b=5: c=0
   - From equation 1 with b=5, c=0: 6a + 105 + d = 148 → 6a + d = 43
   - From equation 2 with b=5, c=0: a + 0 = 5 + d - 6 → a = d - 1
   - Substitute a = d - 1 into 6a + d = 43 → 6(d-1) + d = 43 → 7d = 49 → d=7
   - Then a=6
   - Final number: 1000*6 + 100*5 + 10*0 + 7 = 6507

The ground truth answer (6507) matches our calculation, while the proposed answer (5734) does not.
