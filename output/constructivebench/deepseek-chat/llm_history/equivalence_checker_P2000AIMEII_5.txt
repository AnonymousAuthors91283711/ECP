Ground Truth Answer: 376
Proposed Answer: 241920
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem appears to be about counting certain arrangements (likely related to combinatorics given the use of choose and factorial functions).

2. The ground truth answer is 376, which is a 3-digit number.

3. The proposed answer is 241920, which is a 6-digit number.

4. The problem statement mentions taking the last 3 digits (digits.reverse.take 3), but even if we consider the last 3 digits of 241920 (which would be 920), this doesn't match 376.

5. The proposed answer is significantly larger than the ground truth answer, and there's no obvious transformation that would make them equivalent.
