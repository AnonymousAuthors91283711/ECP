[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of equations with real numbers x, y, z given their pairwise products and a condition involving √5. We'll write a Python program to numerically verify possible values of x by solving the system of equations.

The approach is:
1. Use the given equations to express all variables in terms of y
2. Substitute into the condition T = 4√5
3. Solve for y and then find x
4. Check the solution against all original equations

```python
import math

def solve_problem():
    sqrt5 = math.sqrt(5)
    T = 4 * sqrt5
    
    # From xy = sqrt5 and yz = 5, we get z = 5/y and x = sqrt5/y
    # Then xz = (sqrt5/y)*(5/y) = 5*sqrt5/y² = T = 4*sqrt5
    # So 5*sqrt5/y² = 4*sqrt5 => 5/y² = 4 => y² = 5/4 => y = ±sqrt(5)/2
    
    possible_ys = [sqrt5/2, -sqrt5/2]
    
    for y in possible_ys:
        x = sqrt5 / y
        z = 5 / y
        
        # Verify all equations
        xy = x * y
        yz = y * z
        xz = x * z
        
        print(f"Solution:")
        print(f"x = {x}")
        print(f"y = {y}")
        print(f"z = {z}")
        print(f"xy = {xy} (should be {sqrt5})")
        print(f"yz = {yz} (should be 5)")
        print(f"xz = {xz} (should be {T})")
        print("---")
