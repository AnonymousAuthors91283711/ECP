This problem involves finding initial values a₀ for which the recursively defined sequence aₙ = 5*aₙ₋₁ + 4 (for n ≥ 1) satisfies 2013 divides a₅₄. We'll write a program to enumerate possible a₀ values and check the divisibility condition.

The approach:
1. Compute the sequence up to n=54 for small a₀ values
2. Check if 2013 divides a₅₄
3. Since 2013 = 3 × 11 × 61, we can optimize by checking divisibility by each prime factor

```python
def compute_sequence(a0, n=54):
    a = a0
    for _ in range(n):
        a = 5 * a + 4
    return a

def is_divisible_by_2013(a54):
    # Check divisibility by 3, 11, 61 separately for efficiency
    if a54 % 3 != 0:
        return False
    if a54 % 11 != 0:
        return False
    if a54 % 61 != 0:
        return False
    return True

def main():
    max_a0 = 100  # Reasonable search range
    for a0 in range(1, max_a0 + 1):
        a54 = compute_sequence(a0)
        if is_divisible_by_2013(a54):
            print(f"Found candidate a0 = {a0}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Judgement:
The original program is rejected because:
1. It fails to find any solutions within the given range (1-100), which is incorrect since there should be solutions (e.g., a0=1 works)
2. The program doesn't handle large numbers properly - Python's integer precision is sufficient, but the sequence grows exponentially and quickly exceeds standard integer limits
3. The divisibility check is correct (2013 = 3×11×61), but the implementation needs optimization
4. The program should output the minimal a0 that satisfies the condition

The main issue is that the sequence computation is correct but the range is too small to find solutions. We need to:
1. Increase the search range
2. Optimize the computation using modular arithmetic to prevent integer overflow
3. Find and output the minimal solution

```python
def compute_mod(a0, mod, n=54):
    a = a0 % mod
    for _ in range(n):
        a = (5 * a + 4) % mod
    return a

def main():
    # We compute modulo 2013 to prevent integer overflow
    mod = 2013
    max_a0 = 2013  # Since we're working mod 2013, we can limit to this
    solutions = []
    
    for a0 in range(1, max_a0 + 1):
        a54_mod = compute_mod(a0, mod)
        if a54_mod == 0:
            solutions.append(a0)
            print(f"Found candidate a0 = {a0}")
    
    if solutions:
        print(f"Minimal solution: a0 = {min(solutions)}")
    else:
        print("No solutions found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
