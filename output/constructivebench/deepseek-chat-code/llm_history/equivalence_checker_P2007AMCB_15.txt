Ground Truth Answer: fun (a, r) => a + r
Proposed Answer: fun ⟨a, r⟩ => a * r ^ 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives two infinite series conditions:
   - First series: sum of a*r^n = 7 (geometric series)
   - Second series: sum of a*r^(2k+1) = 3 (odd powers only)

2. From the first series, we know a/(1-r) = 7 (sum of geometric series)
3. The second series can be written as r*(a/(1-r²)) = 3 (sum of odd powers)

4. Solving these equations:
   - From first equation: a = 7(1-r)
   - Substitute into second: r*(7(1-r))/(1-r²) = 3
   - Simplify: 7r/(1+r) = 3 → 7r = 3 + 3r → 4r = 3 → r = 3/4
   - Then a = 7(1-3/4) = 7/4

5. The ground truth answer is a + r = 7/4 + 3/4 = 10/4 = 5/2
6. The proposed answer is a*r² = (7/4)*(9/16) = 63/64 ≠ 5/2

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth, and doesn't satisfy the given conditions.
