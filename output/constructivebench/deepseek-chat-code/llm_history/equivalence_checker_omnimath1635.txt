Ground Truth Answer: 2 ^ 101 - 1
Proposed Answer: 2^100 + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the smallest positive natural number that cannot be expressed as a sum of powers of 2 with exactly 100 terms (since Fin 100 → ℕ represents 100 exponents).

2. The ground truth answer is 2^101 - 1. This makes sense because:
   - The largest number expressible with 100 terms is 100 terms of 2^100 = 100 * 2^100
   - But the first number that cannot be expressed is when we need to combine terms, which happens at 2^101 - 1 (which would require 101 terms of 2^0)

3. The proposed answer is 2^100 + 1. This is incorrect because:
   - 2^100 + 1 can be expressed as (2^100) + (2^0) (two terms), but we have 100 terms available
   - We could express it as (2^100) + (2^0) + 98*(2^0) = sum of 100 terms
   - Therefore 2^100 + 1 is expressible in this form

The proposed answer is incorrect as it represents a number that can indeed be expressed in the required form.
