[write_program]
The problem asks for the smallest integer n ≥ 2 such that for every pair of positive integers (a,b) with a+b=n, at least one of them has a digit sum of 7 or more. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal n by checking each candidate in order.

The approach:
1. For each n starting from 2 upwards, check all possible pairs (a,b) where a+b=n
2. For each pair, verify if either a or b has digit sum ≥7
3. The first n where all pairs satisfy this condition is our answer

```python
def digit_sum(x):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(x))

def check_n(n):
    for a in range(1, n):
        b = n - a
        if digit_sum(a) < 7 and digit_sum(b) < 7:
            return False
    return True

def find_min_n():
    n = 2
    while True:
        if check_n(n):
            print(f"Found candidate: {n}")
            return n
        n += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_n()
```
