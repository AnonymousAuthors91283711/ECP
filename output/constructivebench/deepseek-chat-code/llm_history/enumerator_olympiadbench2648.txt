This problem involves a sequence defined by a recurrence relation and asks for the value of a specific term (a21) given two other terms (a20 and a14). The sequence appears to be geometric since each term is defined in terms of the previous ones with a common ratio.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Model the geometric sequence relationship
2. Use the given values to solve for the parameters
3. Compute a21 based on these parameters

The program will:
- Set up equations based on the given terms
- Solve for the common ratio and first term
- Calculate a21 using these parameters

```python
import math

# Given values
a20 = 8
a14 = 2**21

# The sequence is geometric: a_n = a1 * r^(n-1)
# We can write two equations:
# a20 = a1 * r^19 = 8
# a14 = a1 * r^13 = 2^21

# Divide the equations to eliminate a1:
# (a20/a14) = r^(19-13) => (8/2^21) = r^6
# => 2^3 / 2^21 = r^6 => 2^-18 = r^6 => r = 2^-3

r = 2**(-3)  # Common ratio

# Now solve for a1 using a20 equation:
# a1 = 8 / r^19 = 8 / (2^-3)^19 = 8 * 2^57 = 2^3 * 2^57 = 2^60
a1 = 2**60

# Finally compute a21 = a1 * r^20 = 2^60 * (2^-3)^20 = 2^60 * 2^-60 = 2^0 = 1
a21 = a1 * (r ** 20)

print(f"a21 = {a21}")
```
