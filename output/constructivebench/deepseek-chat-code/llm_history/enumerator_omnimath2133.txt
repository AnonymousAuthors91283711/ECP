This problem involves computing a weighted sum where each digit from the list [1,0,2,0,1,2,1] is multiplied by 4 raised to the power of its position index (0-based). The task is to calculate this sum exactly.

We'll write a Python program that:
1. Defines the digit list and exponent list
2. Computes the sum using exact integer arithmetic
3. Prints the final result

The program will be efficient since it's a straightforward calculation with small numbers.

```python
digits = [1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1]
exponents = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

total = 0
for d, p in zip(digits, exponents):
    total += d * (4 ** p)

print(total)
```
