theorem mathodyssey3
  (c s : ℕ)
  (t : ℝ)
  (ht : t > 1)
  (hcs : c < s)
  (hc : c ≥ 1)
  (hcoin : (c * t + s) = 100)

  (s > 50 → s = mathodyssey3_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: c = 33, s = 34, t = 2.0
c = 33, s = 66, t = 1.0303030303030303
Found solution with s > 50: s = 66. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<66>>>
