theorem omnimath3039
: (Real.sqrt (∏ i in Finset.Icc 1 (omnimath3039_answer - 1), (i : ℝ) / (i + 1)) = 1 / 8) ∧ (∀ n : ℕ, n > 1 → Real.sqrt (∏ i in Finset.Icc 1 (n - 1), (i : ℝ) / (i + 1)) = 1 / 8 → n = omnimath3039_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found candidate: n = 64, sqrt(product) = 0.125
Minimal solution found: n = 64. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<64>>>
