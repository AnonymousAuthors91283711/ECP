  N = olympiadbench2127_answer n k * M := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=2, k=4: N=120, M=3, ratio=40. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
Looking at the pattern from the enumerated answer (n=2, k=4 gives ratio 40), and considering the problem involves counting certain parity-preserving mappings, the answer appears to be related to combinations with power of 2 factors. The general form seems to be:

<<<fun n k => choose (2 * n) k * 2^(k - n)>>>

This matches the example case since choose (2*2) 4 * 2^(4-2) = 6 * 4 = 24 ≠ 40, so perhaps an alternative is needed. Another possibility considering the parity condition:

<<<fun n k => choose n (k / 2) * 2^(k - 1)>>>

For n=2, k=4: choose 2 2 * 2^3 = 1 * 8 = 8 ≠ 40. The correct pattern seems more complex, possibly involving factorial terms. The exact closed form requires deeper combinatorial analysis.
