This problem involves finding real quadruples (x,y,z,w) where each variable is non-zero and satisfies a cyclic system of equations. We'll enumerate possible solutions by:
1. Looking for fixed points where x=y=z=w
2. Checking for simple rational solutions
3. Using numerical approximation when exact solutions aren't obvious

```python
import math

def find_solutions():
    # First check fixed points where x=y=z=w
    print("Checking fixed points x=y=z=w:")
    for sign in [1, -1]:
        # Solve x + 1/x^3 = 2x => 1/x^3 = x => x^4 = 1
        x = sign * 1.0
        print(f"Fixed point solution: ({x}, {x}, {x}, {x})")
    
    # Check for cycles of length 2 (x=z, y=w)
    print("\nChecking cycles of length 2:")
    for sign1 in [1, -1]:
        for sign2 in [1, -1]:
            # We need to solve:
            # x + 1/x^3 = 2y
            # y + 1/y^3 = 2x
            # Let's try x=1, y=1 (already covered)
            # Try x=2^(1/4), y=2^(-1/4)
            x = sign1 * (2 ** 0.25)
            y = sign2 * (2 ** -0.25)
            z = x
            w = y
            print(f"Cycle solution: ({x:.5f}, {y:.5f}, {z:.5f}, {w:.5f})")
    
    # Check for cycles of length 4
    print("\nChecking for cycles of length 4 (numerical approximation):")
    # We'll use fixed point iteration
    def next_val(v):
        return (v + v**-3)/2
    
    # Try different starting points
    for start in [0.5, 1.5, -0.5, -1.5]:
        x = start
        for _ in range(20):
            y = next_val(x)
            z = next_val(y)
            w = next_val(z)
            x_new = next_val(w)
            if abs(x_new - x) < 1e-8:
                break
            x = x_new
        y = next_val(x)
        z = next_val(y)
        w = next_val(z)
        if abs(next_val(w) - x) < 1e-6:
            print(f"Approximate 4-cycle: ({x:.5f}, {y:.5f}, {z:.5f}, {w:.5f})")
