This problem involves finding the greatest term in a 6-term arithmetic sequence where:
1. The 6th term (index 5) is twice the first term (index 0)
2. The sum of all 6 terms is 990
3. We need to find the maximum possible value of the 6th term

We'll approach this by:
1. Expressing the arithmetic sequence terms using a (first term) and d (common difference)
2. Setting up equations based on the given conditions
3. Solving for possible values of a and d
4. Finding the maximum possible 6th term (a + 5d)

```python
def solve():
    # We need to find a and d such that:
    # 1. a + 5d = 2a (from seq5 = 2*seq0)
    # 2. sum_{k=0}^5 (a + k*d) = 990
    # From condition 1: a = 5d
    # Substitute into condition 2:
    # sum_{k=0}^5 (5d + k*d) = 6*5d + d*(0+1+2+3+4+5) = 30d + 15d = 45d = 990
    # So d = 990 / 45 = 22
    # Then a = 5*22 = 110
    # The sixth term is a + 5d = 110 + 110 = 220
    
    # Verification:
    a = 110
    d = 22
    seq5 = a + 5*d
    assert seq5 == 2*a
    total = sum(a + k*d for k in range(6))
    assert total == 990
    
    print(seq5)

solve()
