Ground Truth Answer: -21
Proposed Answer: 28
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a set of real numbers where the floor function condition ⌊x/2⌋ - ⌊x/3⌋ = x/7 holds, and the sum of all such numbers.

2. The ground truth answer is -21, while the proposed answer is 28.

3. The floor function condition suggests we're looking for numbers where the difference between their half and third (rounded down) equals their seventh.

4. The answers have opposite signs and different magnitudes (-21 vs 28), which suggests they cannot be equivalent.

5. Without seeing the detailed solution steps, but based on the significant numerical difference, we can conclude these are not equivalent answers.
