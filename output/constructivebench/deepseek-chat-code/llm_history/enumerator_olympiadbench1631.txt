[write_program]
This problem involves finding the largest integer k such that there exists a positive integer a where 2^(x(a,n)) - 1 is prime for all n from 1 to k. The function x(a,n) is defined recursively.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Implement the recursive x(a,n) function
2. Check primality of numbers of the form 2^x - 1 (Mersenne primes)
3. For small a values, find the maximum k where all 2^(x(a,n))-1 are prime for n=1..k
4. Track the maximum k found across all a values

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]:
        if n % p == 0:
            return n == p
    d = n - 1
    s = 0
    while d % 2 == 0:
        d //= 2
        s += 1
    for a in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]:
        if a >= n:
            continue
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(s - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False
    return True

def x(a, n):
    if n == 1:
        return a
    return 2 * x(a, n-1) + 1

max_k = 0
best_a = 0

# Check a values up to 10 (higher values quickly become computationally expensive)
for a in range(1, 11):
    current_k = 0
    for k in range(1, 10):  # Check up to k=9
        mersenne = (1 << x(a, k)) - 1  # 2^x - 1
        if is_prime(mersenne):
            current_k = k
            print(f"a={a}, k={k}: 2^{x(a,k)}-1 is prime")
        else:
            break
    if current_k > max_k:
        max_k = current_k
        best_a = a

print(f"Maximum k found: {max_k} (for a={best_a})")
```
