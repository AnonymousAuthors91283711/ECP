[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number `n` such that `T â‰¤ C(n,2) * C(n-2,2)`, where `C` is the binomial coefficient. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of `n` for small sample values of `T` to help understand the pattern.

The approach:
1. Compute binomial coefficients efficiently
2. For each sample T value, find the smallest n satisfying the inequality
3. Print results as we find them

```python
import math

def choose(n, k):
    if k < 0 or k > n:
        return 0
    return math.comb(n, k)

def find_min_n(T):
    n = 2  # Start from smallest possible n
    while True:
        c1 = choose(n, 2)
        c2 = choose(n - 2, 2) if n >= 4 else 0
        product = c1 * c2
        if product >= T:
            return n
        n += 1

# Sample T values to test
sample_Ts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000]

print("T\tmin n")
for T in sample_Ts:
    min_n = find_min_n(T)
    print(f"{T}\t{min_n}")
```
