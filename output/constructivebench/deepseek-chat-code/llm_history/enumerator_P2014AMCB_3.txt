[write_program]
This problem is about solving a linear equation to find a positive real number x that satisfies the given equation. The equation is x/3 + 20 + x/5 = x. We'll write a Python program to solve this equation symbolically and numerically to verify the solution.

The approach is:
1. Solve the equation symbolically to get the exact value
2. Compute a numerical approximation for verification
3. Check that the solution is positive as required

```python
from fractions import Fraction
import math

def solve_equation():
    # Symbolic solution using fractions for exact arithmetic
    # Equation: x/3 + 20 + x/5 = x
    # Combine like terms: (1/3 + 1/5)x + 20 = x
    # (5/15 + 3/15)x + 20 = x
    # (8/15)x + 20 = x
    # 20 = x - (8/15)x
    # 20 = (7/15)x
    # x = 20 * (15/7)
    x_exact = Fraction(20) * Fraction(15, 7)
    x_float = float(x_exact)
    
    # Verify the solution
    lhs = x_float/3 + 20 + x_float/5
    rhs = x_float
    tolerance = 1e-10
    assert math.isclose(lhs, rhs, rel_tol=tolerance), "Solution doesn't satisfy equation"
    assert x_float > 0, "Solution must be positive"
    
    print(f"Exact solution as fraction: {x_exact}")
    print(f"Numerical approximation: {x_float:.6f}")

    solve_equation()
