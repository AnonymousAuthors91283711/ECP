[write_program]
This problem is asking for the value of (x + 1)^3 when x = -2. We can compute this directly by substituting x = -2 into the expression. The Python program will simply compute and output this value.

```python
# Compute (x + 1)^3 where x = -2
x = -2
result = (x + 1) ** 3
print(result)
```
