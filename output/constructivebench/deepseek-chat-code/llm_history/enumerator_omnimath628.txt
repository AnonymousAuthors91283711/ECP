[write_program]
This problem asks for the count of numbers between 10^6 and 10^9 that are divisible by 7 and perfect squares. We'll write a Python program to enumerate such numbers efficiently by:

1. Finding the range of integers whose squares fall within [10^6, 10^9]
2. Checking which of these squared numbers are divisible by 7
3. Counting the valid numbers

The key insight is that if mÂ² is divisible by 7, then m must be divisible by 7 (since 7 is prime). So we can iterate through multiples of 7 and check if their squares are in range.

```python
def count_special_numbers():
    min_n = 10**6
    max_n = 10**9
    count = 0
    
    # Calculate the range of m where m^2 is in [min_n, max_n]
    min_m = int(min_n**0.5)
    if min_m * min_m < min_n:
        min_m += 1
    max_m = int(max_n**0.5)
    
    # Only need to check multiples of 7 in this range
    start = ((min_m + 6) // 7) * 7  # smallest multiple of 7 >= min_m
    for m in range(start, max_m + 1, 7):
        square = m * m
        if square > max_n:
            break
        count += 1
        print(f"Found: {square} = {m}^2")
    
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

count_special_numbers()
```
