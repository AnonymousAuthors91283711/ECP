Ground Truth Answer: {f | (∀ n, Even n → f n = 0) ∧ (∀ n, Odd n → ∃ k, f n = k^2)} ∪ {fun n => n^2}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℤ, f = fun n => c * n^2}
Let's analyze the equivalence:

1. The ground truth answer has two cases:
   - Functions that are zero on even inputs and perfect squares on odd inputs
   - The specific function f(n) = n²

2. The proposed answer suggests all functions of form f(n) = c*n²

The proposed answer is more restrictive than the ground truth:
- It doesn't include functions that are zero on evens and arbitrary squares on odds (unless c=0, which would force f(n)=0 for all n)
- It includes functions like f(n)=2n² which don't satisfy the original condition (for example, with a=1, b=0: f(f(1)-0)+0=2*(2*1²)²=8 which isn't a perfect square)

The only overlap is when c=1 (f(n)=n²), which is one of the cases in the ground truth.
