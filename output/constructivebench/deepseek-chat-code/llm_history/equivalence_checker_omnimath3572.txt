Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0, 0)}
Proposed Answer: {(0, 0, 0)} ∪ {(x, -x^2, x^3) | x : ℝ}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a set of real triples (x,y,z) that satisfy two equations:
   - x²y + y²z + z² = 0
   - z³ + z²y + zy³ + x²y = 1/4(x⁴ + y⁴)

2. Ground Truth claims only (0,0,0) satisfies these equations.

3. Proposed Answer claims both (0,0,0) and all points of form (x, -x², x³) satisfy them.

Let's test the proposed solution (x, -x², x³):

First equation:
x²(-x²) + (-x²)²(x³) + (x³)² = -x⁴ + x⁷ + x⁶ ≠ 0 (unless x=0)

Second equation:
(x³)³ + (x³)²(-x²) + x³(-x²)³ + x²(-x²) = x⁹ - x⁸ - x⁹ - x⁴ = -x⁸ - x⁴
1/4(x⁴ + (-x²)⁴) = 1/4(x⁴ + x⁸)

These are not equal unless x=0.

Only (0,0,0) satisfies both equations, so the ground truth is correct and the proposed answer is incorrect.
