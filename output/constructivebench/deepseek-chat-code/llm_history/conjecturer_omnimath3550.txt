(hP : P = fun m : ℤ => (Polynomial.X)^4 - (Polynomial.C (2*m + 4))*(Polynomial.X)^2 + Polynomial.C ((m - 2)^2))
: {m : ℤ | ∃ A B : Polynomial ℤ, A ≠ 0 ∧ B ≠ 0 ∧ P m = A * B} = omnimath3550_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking m values where P(m) is factorable:
m = 0
m = 1
m = 2
m = 4
m = 8
m = 9
m = 16
m = 18
Checking negative values:. Expected Answer Type: Set ℤ
Looking at the enumerated answers and the polynomial structure, we notice the polynomial factors when m = k² or m = k² + 2k for integer k. This suggests the solution set includes perfect squares and numbers of form k²+2k. The negative values don't yield factorable polynomials in this pattern.
