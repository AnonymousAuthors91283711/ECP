open Real Set

abbrev P2021AMCB_21_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
def solution_set : Set ℝ := {x | x > 0 ∧ x^2 = 2^x}

theorem P2021AMCB_21 (S : ℝ) :
    (S = ∑' x : solution_set, (x : ℝ)) ↔ S ∈ P2021AMCB_21_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Positive solutions to x^2 = 2^x:
x = 2
x = 4
x = 0.5

Sum of solutions: 6.5. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
<<<{2, 4, 1/2}>>>
