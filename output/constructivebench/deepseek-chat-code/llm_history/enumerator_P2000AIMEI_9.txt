This problem involves finding the sum of y-coordinates from two distinct triples (x₁,y₁,z₁) and (x₂,y₂,z₂) that satisfy given power sum conditions. We'll approach this by:

1. Using Newton's identities to find the elementary symmetric polynomials
2. Constructing the characteristic polynomial whose roots are x,y,z
3. Solving for possible triples
4. Finding distinct pairs of triples and computing y₁ + y₂

```python
import itertools
from math import isclose

def solve():
    # Given conditions:
    s1 = 6  # x+y+z
    s2 = 8  # x²+y²+z²
    s3 = 5  # x³+y³+z³
    
    # Calculate elementary symmetric polynomials using Newton's identities
    # σ1 = x+y+z = s1
    # σ2 = xy+yz+zx = (s1² - s2)/2
    # σ3 = xyz = (s1³ - 3s1s2 + 2s3)/6
    sigma1 = s1
    sigma2 = (s1**2 - s2)/2
    sigma3 = (s1**3 - 3*s1*s2 + 2*s3)/6
    
    # The roots satisfy t³ - σ1 t² + σ2 t - σ3 = 0
    # We'll find all real roots (there may be multiple real roots)
