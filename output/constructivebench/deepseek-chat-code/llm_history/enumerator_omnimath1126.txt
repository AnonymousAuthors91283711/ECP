The problem is to find the probability p (between 0 and 1) where the probability of getting exactly 2 successes in 4 Bernoulli trials equals the probability of getting exactly 3 successes. The equation simplifies to a polynomial equation in p. We'll enumerate possible rational solutions and check them against the equation.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from math import comb

def solve():
    # The equation simplifies to: 6p^2(1-p)^2 = 4p^3(1-p)
    # Which further simplifies to: 3(1-p) = 2p ⇒ 3 - 3p = 2p ⇒ 3 = 5p ⇒ p = 3/5
    # But we'll demonstrate the enumeration approach for educational purposes
    
    # Enumerate possible rational solutions with denominators up to 10
    for denominator in range(1, 11):
        for numerator in range(0, denominator + 1):
            p = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
            left = comb(4, 2) * p**2 * (1-p)**2
            right = comb(4, 3) * p**3 * (1-p)
            if left == right:
                print(f"Found solution: p = {p} (exact {p.numerator}/{p.denominator})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
