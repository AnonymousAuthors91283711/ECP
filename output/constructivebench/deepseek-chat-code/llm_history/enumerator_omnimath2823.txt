[write_program]
This problem appears to be a simple arithmetic evaluation where we need to compute (5 - 2)/(2 + 1). The solution is straightforward, but we'll write a Python program that demonstrates the computation and could be extended for more complex cases.

The program will:
1. Compute the numerator (5 - 2)
2. Compute the denominator (2 + 1)
3. Calculate the division result
4. Print the exact rational value

```python
def main():
    numerator = 5 - 2
    denominator = 2 + 1
    result = numerator / denominator
    # Print as exact fraction (though in this case it simplifies to 1)
    print(f"{numerator}/{denominator}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
