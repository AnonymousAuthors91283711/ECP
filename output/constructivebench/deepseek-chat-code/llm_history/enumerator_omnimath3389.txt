[write_program]
This problem involves verifying a trigonometric identity for sums up to n=2010 and finding a closed-form expression for the sum up to n=2011. We'll write a Python program to numerically verify the identity for small values of n and x, which can help conjecture the general pattern.

The program will:
1. Test the identity for small n values (0-5) with x=π/3 (a value where sin(x)≠0)
2. Compute both sides of the equation to verify they match
3. Show the pattern of the sum to help conjecture the general formula

```python
import math

def verify_identity(n_max, x):
    sin_x = math.sin(x)
    if sin_x == 0:
        return "sin(x) cannot be zero"
    
    print(f"Testing for x = {x:.3f} (≈π/{math.pi/x:.1f})")
    print("n | LHS sum | RHS expression | Difference")
    
    for n in range(n_max + 1):
        # Compute LHS: sum_{k=0}^n [sin²(2^k x) * product_{m=0}^{k-1} cos²(2^m x)]
        lhs = 0.0
        product = 1.0  # accumulates product of cos² terms
        
        for k in range(n + 1):
            term = (math.sin(2**k * x))**2 * product
            lhs += term
            if k < n:  # update product for next term
                product *= (math.cos(2**k * x))**2
        
        # Compute RHS: 1 - sin²(2^{n+1} x)/(4^{n+1} sin² x)
        rhs = 1 - (math.sin(2**(n+1) * x))**2 / (4**(n+1) * sin_x**2)
        
        diff = abs(lhs - rhs)
        print(f"{n} | {lhs:.6f} | {rhs:.6f} | {diff:.2e}")

# Test with x = π/3 (60 degrees) and n up to 5
verify_identity(5, math.pi/3)
```
