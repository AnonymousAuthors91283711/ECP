[write_program]
This problem asks for all positive integers n where there exists a sequence of positive integers x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ such that the sum of 2^(i-1)/(x_i)² for i from 1 to n equals 1. We'll write a Python program to search for such n values by enumerating possible sequences.

The approach:
1. For small n values (1-10), try to find sequences x_i that satisfy the equation
2. For each n, generate possible x_i values in a reasonable range (1-100)
3. Use memoization and early termination to optimize the search
4. Output n values where solutions exist

```python
import itertools

def find_valid_n(max_n=10, max_x=100):
    valid_ns = []
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        # Generate all possible x_i sequences where x_i are positive integers ≤ max_x
        # We'll use a recursive approach with memoization
        found = False
        
        # The exponents part is fixed for each i: 2^(i-1)
        exponents = [2**(i) for i in range(n)]  # i is 0-based in code
        
        # We'll try all possible x_i in increasing order
        # The equation is sum (exponents[i] / x_i^2) = 1
        # We can compute partial sums and check
        
        # Using a generator to avoid memory issues
        def generate_sequences(remaining_depth, current_xs, remaining_sum):
            if remaining_depth == 0:
                if abs(remaining_sum) < 1e-10:  # floating point tolerance
                    yield current_xs
                return
            
            i = n - remaining_depth
            max_possible_x = int((exponents[i] / remaining_sum)**0.5) + 2
            max_possible_x = min(max_possible_x, max_x)
            
            for x in range(1, max_possible_x + 1):
                term = exponents[i] / (x * x)
                if term > remaining_sum + 1e-10:
                    continue
                yield from generate_sequences(
                    remaining_depth - 1,
                    current_xs + [x],
                    remaining_sum - term
                )
        
        # Try to find at least one solution
        for solution in generate_sequences(n, [], 1.0):
            print(f"n = {n}, solution found: {solution}")
            valid_ns.append(n)
            found = True
            break
        
        if not found:
            print(f"n = {n}, no solution found with x_i ≤ {max_x}")
    
    print("\nValid n values found:", valid_ns)

find_valid_n()
