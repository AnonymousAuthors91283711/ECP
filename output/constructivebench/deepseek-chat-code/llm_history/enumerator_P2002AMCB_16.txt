This problem involves counting the number of pairs (p₁, p₂) where p₁ ∈ {0,...,7}, p₂ ∈ {0,...,5}, and 3 divides (p₁+1)(p₂+1). We'll enumerate all possible pairs and count those satisfying the condition.

The Python program will:
1. Iterate through all possible pairs (i,j) where i ranges 0-7 and j ranges 0-5
2. Check if (i+1)*(j+1) is divisible by 3
3. Count and print satisfying pairs
4. Calculate the probability (count/total pairs)

```python
def main():
    count = 0
    total = 8 * 6
    for i in range(8):
        for j in range(6):
            if (i + 1) * (j + 1) % 3 == 0:
                count += 1
                print(f"Found pair: ({i}, {j})")
    print(f"Total satisfying pairs: {count}")
    print(f"Probability: {count}/{total} = {count/total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
