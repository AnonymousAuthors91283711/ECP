This problem asks for the smallest natural number `k` such that there exist two non-empty subsets `s₁` and `s₂` of {1,2,...,2016} with combined size 4032 - k (i.e., missing `k` elements total), where the products of linear terms (x - i) for i in each subset are distinct polynomials.

We'll approach this by:
1. Understanding that the minimal `k` occurs when the subsets are as large as possible (i.e., when their union is the full set)
2. The worst case for distinctness is when the subsets are complements of each other
3. We need to find the minimal `k` where two different subsets can produce different polynomials

The key insight is that the minimal `k` occurs when one subset is {1} and the other is {2}, requiring only 2 elements (so k = 4032 - 2 = 4030). However, we need to verify smaller k values don't work.

```python
def main():
    # We'll test small k values to find the minimal one where distinct subsets exist
    max_n = 2016
    for k in range(0, 10):  # Check small k values first
        total_elements = 4032 - k
        # The minimal case is when one subset has 1 element and the other has total_elements-1
        # We need at least two distinct singleton subsets
        if total_elements >= 2:  # Need at least two elements total
            print(f"k={k}: Possible (minimal case with two singletons)")
            print(f"Minimal k found: {k}")
            return

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
