This problem asks for the minimal rational number q such that for all integers r,s satisfying the inequalities 3r ≥ 2s-3 and 4s ≥ r+12, we have r/s ≥ q. We need to find this minimal q by enumerating possible rational values.

The approach is to:
1. Iterate through possible small integer values of s
2. For each s, find the minimal r satisfying both inequalities
3. Calculate r/s and track the minimal value

```python
def find_min_q():
    min_q = float('inf')
    # We'll search s in a reasonable range where solutions exist
    for s in range(1, 100):
        # Find minimal r satisfying both inequalities
        # From first inequality: r ≥ (2s - 3)/3
        # From second inequality: r ≤ 4s - 12
        lower_r = (2 * s - 3 + 2) // 3  # ceil((2s-3)/3)
        upper_r = 4 * s - 12
        if lower_r > upper_r:
            continue  # no solution for this s
        
        # The minimal r/s occurs at minimal r
        r = lower_r
        current_q = r / s
        print(f"Found candidate: r={r}, s={s}, q={current_q}")
        if current_q < min_q:
            min_q = current_q
    
    print(f"\nMinimal q found: {min_q}")

find_min_q()
```
