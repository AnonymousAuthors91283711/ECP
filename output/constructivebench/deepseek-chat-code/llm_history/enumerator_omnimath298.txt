[write_program]
This problem asks for all pairs of positive integers (x, y) where x^y = y^(x-y). We'll write a Python program to enumerate small pairs and look for patterns.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible x and y values up to a reasonable limit
2. For each pair, check if x^y equals y^(x-y)
3. Avoid floating point inaccuracies by using exact integer arithmetic
4. Print valid pairs as they're found

```python
def main():
    max_n = 20  # Reasonable upper bound for enumeration
    print(f"Searching for x^y = y^(x-y) with x,y â‰¤ {max_n}")
    print("Valid pairs found:")
    
    for x in range(1, max_n + 1):
        for y in range(1, max_n + 1):
            if x == y:  # Trivial solution
                print(f"({x}, {y})")
                continue
            try:
                left = x ** y
                right = y ** (x - y)
                if left == right:
                    print(f"({x}, {y})")
            except OverflowError:
                continue  # Skip very large numbers that cause overflow

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
