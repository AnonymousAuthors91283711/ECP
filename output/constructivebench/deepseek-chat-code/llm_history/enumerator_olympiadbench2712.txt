This problem asks for the minimal value of `s = x + y*z` where `x, y, z` are positive integers satisfying `x*y + z = 160`. We'll enumerate possible combinations efficiently by iterating through possible values of `x` and `y`, then computing `z` from the equation.

The approach:
1. Iterate `x` from 1 to 159 (since x*y must be <160)
2. For each `x`, iterate `y` from 1 to floor(159/x)
3. Compute `z = 160 - x*y` (must be positive)
4. Calculate `s = x + y*z` and track the minimum

```python
def find_min_s():
    min_s = float('inf')
    # Iterate possible x values (1 <= x <= 159)
    for x in range(1, 160):
        # Maximum y where x*y < 160
        max_y = 160 // x
        for y in range(1, max_y + 1):
            z = 160 - x * y
            if z > 0:  # Ensure z is positive
                s = x + y * z
                if s < min_s:
                    min_s = s
                    print(f"New minimum found: s={s} (x={x}, y={y}, z={z})")
    print(f"Final minimal s: {min_s}")

find_min_s()
```
