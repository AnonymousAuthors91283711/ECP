abbrev IMO2013SLN1_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem IMO2013SLN1 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ m n : ℕ, m^2 + f n ∣ m * f m + n) ↔ f = IMO2013SLN1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing linear and quadratic functions up to small coefficients:
Found candidate: f(n) = 1n + 0
Found candidate: identity function f(n) = n

Testing appears to suggest f(n) = n is the solution.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun n : ℕ => n>>>
