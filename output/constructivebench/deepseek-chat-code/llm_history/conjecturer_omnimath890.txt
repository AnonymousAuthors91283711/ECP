Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the enumerated solutions, we can observe that the largest value of 'a' occurs when a=62. The pattern shows that the maximum 'a' value is increasing, and the last recorded solution is a=62. Based on the problem's condition and the enumerated solutions, the greatest 'a' satisfying the given constraints appears to be 62.

<<<62>>>
