[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of n^3 and n! is at least 100. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal n by checking each integer sequentially until we find the first one satisfying the condition.

The approach:
1. For each n starting from 1, compute gcd(n^3, n!)
2. Stop when we find the first n where this gcd â‰¥ 100
3. We'll use math.gcd for the calculation and math.factorial for n!

```python
import math

def find_min_n():
    n = 1
    while True:
        n_cubed = n ** 3
        n_factorial = math.factorial(n)
        current_gcd = math.gcd(n_cubed, n_factorial)
        if current_gcd >= 100:
            print(f"Found n = {n} with gcd(n^3, n!) = {current_gcd}")
            print(f"Minimal n satisfying the condition: {n}")
            return
        n += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_n()
```
