[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimum y value such that there exists an x satisfying the equation (y + x) = (y - x)^2 + 3*(y - x) + 3. We'll approach this by:

1. Simplifying the equation to find a relationship between x and y
2. Expressing x in terms of y (or vice versa)
3. Finding the minimum y value that allows real solutions

The Python program will:
1. Symbolically solve the equation for x in terms of y
2. Find when the discriminant is non-negative (real solutions exist)
3. Find the minimal y value satisfying this condition

```python
import sympy as sp

def find_min_y():
    x, y = sp.symbols('x y')
    # Original equation: y + x = (y - x)^2 + 3*(y - x) + 3
    # Let's simplify it
    equation = sp.Eq(y + x, (y - x)**2 + 3*(y - x) + 3)
    
    # Expand and rearrange terms
    expanded_eq = equation.expand()
    simplified_eq = sp.simplify(expanded_eq)
    
    # Collect terms to form quadratic in x
    quadratic_in_x = sp.collect(simplified_eq.lhs - simplified_eq.rhs, x)
    
    # Get coefficients a, b, c for quadratic formula ax^2 + bx + c = 0
    a = quadratic_in_x.coeff(x, 2)
    b = quadratic_in_x.coeff(x, 1)
    c = quadratic_in_x.coeff(x, 0)
    
    # Discriminant must be >= 0 for real solutions
    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
    discriminant_simplified = sp.simplify(discriminant)
    
    # Solve discriminant >= 0 for y
    solution = sp.solve(discriminant_simplified >= 0, y)
    
    # Find minimal y value where discriminant is non-negative
    critical_points = sp.solve(discriminant_simplified, y)
    minimal_y = min(critical_points)
    
    # Verify by checking discriminant at minimal_y and nearby points
    print(f"Critical points where discriminant is zero: {critical_points}")
    print(f"Minimal y value allowing real solutions: {minimal_y}")
    
    # For completeness, show the x value at minimal y
    x_at_min_y = sp.solve(equation.subs(y, minimal_y), x)
    print(f"Corresponding x value at minimal y: {x_at_min_y[0]}")

find_min_y()
