The problem is to compute the sum (1 + Î£ from k=1 to 4 of 11*(11-k)*descFactorial(11,k)) modulo 1000, where descFactorial(n,k) is the falling factorial n*(n-1)*...*(n-k+1). We'll compute this directly in Python.

```python
def desc_factorial(n, k):
    """Compute the descending factorial n*(n-1)*...*(n-k+1)"""
    result = 1
    for i in range(k):
        result *= (n - i)
    return result

total = 1  # Start with the 1 in the expression
for k in range(1, 5):  # k from 1 to 4
    term = 11 * (11 - k) * desc_factorial(11, k)
    total += term

result = total % 1000
print(result)
```
