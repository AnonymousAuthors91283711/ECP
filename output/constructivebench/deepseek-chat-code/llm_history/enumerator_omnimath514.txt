[write_program]
This problem asks to find all real pairs (x,y) that satisfy the equation (x+y)² = (x+1)(y-1). We'll write a Python program to explore possible solutions by testing rational values and looking for patterns.

The approach:
1. Expand both sides of the equation to get x² + 2xy + y² = xy - x + y - 1
2. Rearrange terms to standard quadratic form
3. For each x in a reasonable range, solve for y
4. Print exact solutions when found (particularly rational ones)

```python
def find_solutions():
    print("Searching for real solutions to (x+y)^2 = (x+1)(y-1)")
    print("Exact solutions found:")
    
    # Test small integer values for x
    for x in range(-5, 6):
        # Coefficients of quadratic in y: Ay^2 + By + C = 0
        A = 1
        B = 2*x - 1
        C = x*x + x + 1
        
        discriminant = B*B - 4*A*C
        
        if discriminant >= 0:
            sqrt_disc = discriminant**0.5
            y1 = (-B + sqrt_disc) / (2*A)
            y2 = (-B - sqrt_disc) / (2*A)
            
            # Print exact solutions when discriminant is perfect square
            if discriminant == 0:
                print(f"(x={x}, y={y1}) (double root)")
            else:
                print(f"(x={x}, y={y1})")
                print(f"(x={x}, y={y2})")
    
    print("\nGeneral solution pattern appears to be:")
    print("For any real x, y = (-2x + 1 ± sqrt(-3x^2 - 6x - 3))/2")
    print("But discriminant -3x^2 -6x -3 must be non-negative")
