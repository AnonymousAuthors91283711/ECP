Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 1, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (2, 1, 0), (3, 0, 0)}
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is about finding all triples (w, l, t) where:
1. w + l + t = 3
2. There exists g_for > g_against (meaning the team scored more goals than conceded)

The ground truth answer is {(0, 1, 2)} which means:
- 0 wins, 1 loss, 2 ties
- But this doesn't satisfy g_for > g_against since with ties, goals are equal

The proposed answer includes:
- (1,0,2): 1 win (implies g_for > g_against), 0 losses, 2 ties
- (2,0,1): 2 wins, 0 losses, 1 tie
- (2,1,0): 2 wins, 1 loss, 0 ties
- (3,0,0): 3 wins, 0 losses, 0 ties

All these satisfy both conditions:
1. Sum to 3
2. Have at least one win (which implies g_for > g_against in that game)

The ground truth answer is actually incorrect as it doesn't satisfy g_for > g_against, while the proposed answer correctly identifies all triples that satisfy both conditions.
