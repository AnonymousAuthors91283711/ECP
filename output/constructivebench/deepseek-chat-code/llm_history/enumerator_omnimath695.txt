[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of integer pairs (x,y) where 0 < x ≤ 2020, 0 < y ≤ 2020, and 3x² + 10xy + 3y² is a prime power (p^k where p is prime and k ≥ 1). We'll write a Python program to enumerate such pairs efficiently.

Key observations:
1. The expression factors as (3x + y)(x + 3y)
2. For this to be a prime power, both factors must be powers of the same prime (with one possibly being 1)
3. We can iterate through possible x and y values while checking the condition

```python
import math
from sympy import isprime

def count_pairs(max_val=2020):
    count = 0
    for x in range(1, max_val + 1):
        for y in range(1, max_val + 1):
            a = 3*x + y
            b = x + 3*y
            if a == 1 or b == 1:
                continue  # 1 is not a prime power
            gcd_val = math.gcd(a, b)
            if gcd_val == 0:
                continue
            # Check if a/gcd and b/gcd are both 1 or coprime
            a_reduced = a // gcd_val
            b_reduced = b // gcd_val
            if (a_reduced == 1 or b_reduced == 1) or (a_reduced == b_reduced == 1):
                # Now check if gcd_val is a prime power
                if gcd_val == 1:
                    # Need either a or b to be a prime power
                    if (a == 1 and isprime(b)) or (b == 1 and isprime(a)) or (isprime(a) and b == 1) or (isprime(b) and a == 1):
                        count += 1
                else:
                    # Check if gcd_val is a prime power
                    if isprime(gcd_val):
                        count += 1
                    else:
                        # Check higher powers
                        temp = gcd_val
                        p = None
                        for p_candidate in range(2, int(math.sqrt(temp)) + 1):
                            if temp % p_candidate == 0 and isprime(p_candidate):
                                while temp % p_candidate == 0:
                                    temp //= p_candidate
                                if temp == 1:
                                    count += 1
                                break
    return count
