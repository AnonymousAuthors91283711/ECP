This problem involves counting the number of valid colorings of a 2×6 grid graph with 12 colors under adjacency constraints, then finding the number of divisors of that count. We'll write a Python program to enumerate smaller cases (2×n grids for small n) to help identify the pattern.

```python
from itertools import permutations
from math import gcd

def count_valid_colorings(m, n, k):
    """Count valid colorings of m×n grid with k colors where adjacent colors differ mod 3"""
    size = m * n
    if size > k:
        return 0  # Not enough colors for injective mapping
    
    count = 0
    grid = [(i, j) for i in range(m) for j in range(n)]
    
    for coloring in permutations(range(k), size):
        valid = True
        # Check injectivity (guaranteed by permutation) and adjacency condition
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if i > 0 and (coloring[i*n+j] - coloring[(i-1)*n+j]) % 3 == 0:
                    valid = False
                    break
                if j > 0 and (coloring[i*n+j] - coloring[i*n+j-1]) % 3 == 0:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1
    return count

def num_divisors(n):
    """Count number of divisors of n"""
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i*i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1 if i*i == n else 2
        i += 1
    return count

# Enumerate smaller cases to observe pattern
for n in range(1, 4):  # 2×1, 2×2, 2×3 grids
    m = 2
    k = 2 * n + 6  # Using more colors than needed for injectivity
    count = count_valid_colorings(m, n, k)
    divisors = num_divisors(count)
    print(f"2×{n} grid: {count} valid colorings, {divisors} divisors")
```
