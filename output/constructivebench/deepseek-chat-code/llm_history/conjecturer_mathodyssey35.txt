. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the enumerated answers, we observe that the minimal sum occurs when b=38 and a=155, giving a total of 193. The pattern shows the sum decreases as b increases, reaching its minimum at the largest possible b value before the conditions fail. The minimal sum is simply the smallest value found in the enumeration.

<<<193>>>
