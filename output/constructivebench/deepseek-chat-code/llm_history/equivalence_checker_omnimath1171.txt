Ground Truth Answer: 725
Proposed Answer: (26 * 28) - 3
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem gives us two equations:
   - a + b + c = 26
   - 1/a + 1/b + 1/c = 28

2. We need to find the value of (a/b + b/c + c/a + a/c + c/b + b/a)

3. The ground truth answer is 725
4. The proposed answer is (26*28)-3 = 728-3 = 725

The proposed answer matches exactly with the ground truth answer. The calculation shows:
26 * 28 = 728
728 - 3 = 725

Therefore, the answers are equivalent.
