[write_program]
This problem involves evaluating a nested expression `spade 3 (spade 4 5)` where `spade` is defined as `(x + y) * (x - y)`. The task is to compute this value exactly. We'll write a Python program to compute this expression step by step.

The approach is:
1. First compute the inner `spade 4 5` which is `(4+5)*(4-5)`
2. Then compute the outer `spade 3` with the result from step 1
3. Output the final result

```python
def spade(x, y):
    return (x + y) * (x - y)

# Compute inner spade(4,5)
inner = spade(4, 5)
print(f"spade(4,5) = {inner}")

# Compute outer spade(3, inner)
result = spade(3, inner)
print(f"Final result = {result}")
```
