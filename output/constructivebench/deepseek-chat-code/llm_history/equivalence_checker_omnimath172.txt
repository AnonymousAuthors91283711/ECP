<<<True>>>

The proposed answer and ground truth answer are equivalent. Both describe the same set of integer triples (a, b, c) that are permutations of consecutive integers (k, k+1, k+2) for some integer k. The proposed answer uses explicit logical conditions while the ground truth answer uses set builder notation with multiple cases, but they represent exactly the same mathematical concept. All six possible permutations of three consecutive integers are covered in both answers.
