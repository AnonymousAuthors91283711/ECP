This problem involves summing the reciprocals of all positive divisors of 144. To solve it computationally, we'll:
1. Find all positive divisors of 144
2. Sum their reciprocals
3. Output the exact rational result

The divisors of 144 can be found by considering its prime factorization (2^4 * 3^2) and generating all combinations.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def get_divisors(n):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(n // i)
    return sorted(divisors)

def main():
    n = 144
    divisors = get_divisors(n)
    total = Fraction(0, 1)
    for d in divisors:
        total += Fraction(1, d)
    print(total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
