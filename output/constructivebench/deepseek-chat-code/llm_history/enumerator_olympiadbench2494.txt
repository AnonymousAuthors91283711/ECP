[write_program]
This problem involves finding all real numbers `a` for which there exist real numbers `x` and `y` satisfying two trigonometric equations. The equations relate squares of sine and cosine functions of `x` and `y` to expressions involving `a`.

We'll write a Python program to numerically search for possible values of `a` that satisfy the equations. The approach will be:
1. Sample possible values of `a` in a reasonable range
2. For each `a`, try to find `x` and `y` that satisfy both equations
3. Since exact solutions are difficult, we'll look for approximate solutions within a tolerance

```python
import numpy as np

def find_possible_a_values():
    # We'll search a in [-2, 2] since trigonometric functions are bounded
    a_values = np.linspace(-2, 2, 1000)
    tolerance = 1e-6
    solutions = []
    
    for a in a_values:
        # The equations are:
        # sin²x + cos²y = 1.5*a
        # cos²x + sin²y = 0.5*a²
        
        # Since sin² + cos² = 1 for any angle, we can add both equations:
        # (sin²x + cos²x) + (sin²y + cos²y) = 1.5*a + 0.5*a²
        # 1 + 1 = 1.5*a + 0.5*a²
        # So we must have: 2 = 1.5*a + 0.5*a²
        # Which simplifies to: a² + 3a - 4 = 0
        
        # Check if a satisfies the necessary condition first
        if abs(a**2 + 3*a - 4) > tolerance:
            continue
            
        # Now try to find x and y that satisfy original equations
        # Let's try x = y = 0 as a test case
        x, y = 0.0, 0.0
        eq1 = np.sin(x)**2 + np.cos(y)**2 - 1.5*a
        eq2 = np.cos(x)**2 + np.sin(y)**2 - 0.5*a**2
        
        if abs(eq1) < tolerance and abs(eq2) < tolerance:
            solutions.append(a)
            print(f"Found solution: a = {a:.6f}")
            continue
            
        # Try another test case: x = y = pi/2
        x, y = np.pi/2, np.pi/2
        eq1 = np.sin(x)**2 + np.cos(y)**2 - 1.5*a
        eq2 = np.cos(x)**2 + np.sin(y)**2 - 0.5*a**2
        
        if abs(eq1) < tolerance and abs(eq2) < tolerance:
            solutions.append(a)
            print(f"Found solution: a = {a:.6f}")
            continue
            
    # Print unique solutions after rounding to avoid duplicates from numerical precision
    unique_solutions = list(set(round(a, 6) for a in solutions))
    print("\nPossible a values satisfying the equations:")
    for a in sorted(unique_solutions):
        print(f"a ≈ {a:.6f}")
