This problem is a simple linear equation where we need to find the value of 4x given that 2x - 3 = 10. The solution involves solving for x first, then calculating 4x. Since it's a straightforward algebraic problem, we'll demonstrate the solution process through enumeration of possible values.

```python
# Solving 2x - 3 = 10 for x, then calculating 4x
x = (10 + 3) / 2  # Solve for x
answer = 4 * x     # Calculate 4x
print(answer)      # Output the exact value
```
