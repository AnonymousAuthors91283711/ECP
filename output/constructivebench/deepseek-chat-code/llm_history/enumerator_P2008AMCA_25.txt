The problem involves a recurrence relation with a rotation matrix effect. We need to find the sum of initial terms a₁ + b₁ given the values at n=100. The recurrence suggests a geometric progression with complex numbers, where each step rotates by π/6 and scales by 2.

We'll implement a backward recurrence to compute (a₁, b₁) from (a₁₀₀, b₁₀₀). The exact solution involves trigonometric identities, but we'll numerically verify the pattern.

```python
import math

def main():
    # Given values at n=100
    a100, b100 = 2.0, 4.0
    
    # Backward recurrence: solve for (a_n, b_n) given (a_{n+1}, b_{n+1})
    # The inverse transformation is:
    # a_n = (sqrt(3)*a_{n+1} + b_{n+1})/4
    # b_n = (-a_{n+1} + sqrt(3)*b_{n+1})/4
    sqrt3 = math.sqrt(3)
    
    a, b = a100, b100
    for n in range(99, 0, -1):
        new_a = (sqrt3 * a + b) / 4
        new_b = (-a + sqrt3 * b) / 4
        a, b = new_a, new_b
        # Print intermediate values for verification
        if n <= 5:  # Only show first few steps to avoid clutter
            print(f"n={n}: a={a:.15f}, b={b:.15f}, sum={a+b:.15f}")
    
    print(f"\nFinal answer: a1 + b1 = {a + b}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
