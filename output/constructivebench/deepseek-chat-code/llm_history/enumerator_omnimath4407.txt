This problem involves finding a function `omnimath4407_answer` that satisfies two conditions: boundedness and a separation condition. We'll explore potential candidates by enumerating simple functions and checking the conditions for small values of `a` and `n`.

We'll test three candidate functions: linear, logarithmic, and power functions. For each, we'll check the boundedness and separation conditions for small integer values of `a` and `n`.

```python
import math

def check_conditions(a, n_values, func):
    """Check if function satisfies both conditions for given a and n_values."""
    # Check boundedness condition
    values = [func(a, n) for n in n_values]
    bounded = all(abs(v) < 1000 for v in values)  # arbitrary large bound
    
    # Check separation condition for all i != j pairs
    separation_ok = True
    for i in n_values:
        for j in n_values:
            if i != j:
                diff = abs(func(a, i) - func(a, j))
                term = diff * (abs(i - j) ** a)
                if term < 0.99:  # slightly below 1 to account for floating point
                    separation_ok = False
                    break
        if not separation_ok:
            break
    
    return bounded and separation_ok

def linear(a, n):
    return n

def logarithmic(a, n):
    return math.log(n + 1)  # +1 to avoid log(0)

def power(a, n):
    return n ** (1/a)

def test_candidates():
    sample_a = [1.5, 2.0, 2.5]  # a > 1 as per condition
    sample_n = list(range(1, 10))
    
    for a in sample_a:
        print(f"\nTesting a = {a}")
        for name, func in [("linear", linear), ("logarithmic", logarithmic), ("power", power)]:
            if check_conditions(a, sample_n, func):
                print(f"{name} function satisfies conditions for a={a}")
            else:
                print(f"{name} function fails for a={a}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_candidates()
