[write_program]
This problem involves finding the value of (3*b)/a when a = 1.5*b. The solution can be derived algebraically, but we'll write a Python program to verify this numerically with different values of b.

The program will:
1. Test multiple values of b
2. Calculate a = 1.5*b for each b
3. Compute (3*b)/a
4. Convert to percentage by multiplying by 100
5. Show that the result is consistent regardless of b's value

```python
def verify_ratio():
    # Test various values of b
    test_values = [1, 2, 3.5, 10, 100, 0.01]
    print("Testing different values of b:")
    for b in test_values:
        a = 1.5 * b
        ratio = (3 * b) / a
        percentage = ratio * 100
        print(f"b={b}: (3*b)/a = {percentage}%")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    verify_ratio()
```
