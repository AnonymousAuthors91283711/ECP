[write_program]
This problem asks to find two distinct numbers x and y between 1 and 37 such that:
1. The sum of all numbers from 1 to 37 excluding x and y equals x*y
2. The difference y - x is maximized (since we're looking for P2021AMCB_10_answer)

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Calculate the total sum of numbers 1-37
2. For all pairs (x,y) where 1 ≤ x < y ≤ 37
3. Check if (total_sum - x - y) == x*y
4. Track the pair with maximum y - x difference

```python
def main():
    total_sum = 37 * 38 // 2  # Sum of 1 to 37
    max_diff = 0
    best_pair = None
    
    for x in range(1, 38):
        for y in range(x+1, 38):  # Ensure y > x
            if (total_sum - x - y) == x * y:
                current_diff = y - x
                print(f"Found valid pair: ({x}, {y}) with difference {current_diff}")
                if current_diff > max_diff:
                    max_diff = current_diff
                    best_pair = (x, y)
    
    if best_pair:
        x, y = best_pair
        print(f"\nMaximum difference pair: ({x}, {y}) with difference {max_diff}")
    else:
        print("No valid pairs found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
