This problem asks for the largest subset of {0,1,...,54} where no two elements differ by exactly 4. We'll enumerate possible subset sizes to find the maximum.

The approach is to model this as a graph coloring problem where we need to select the maximum independent set in a graph where edges connect numbers differing by 4. The solution can be found by partitioning the numbers into residue classes modulo 8 and taking alternating elements.

```python
def max_subset_no_diff_4(n=55):
    # The maximum subset is achieved by taking numbers congruent to 0,1,2,3 mod 8
    # or numbers congruent to 4,5,6,7 mod 8 (whichever is larger)
    count1 = sum(1 for x in range(n) if x % 8 in {0,1,2,3})
    count2 = sum(1 for x in range(n) if x % 8 in {4,5,6,7})
    return max(count1, count2)

# For n=55, let's verify:
print("Maximum subset size for n=55:", max_subset_no_diff_4())

# Enumerate smaller cases to see the pattern
for n in range(1, 20):
    print(f"n={n}: max subset size = {max_subset_no_diff_4(n)}")
```
