[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of logarithmic equations with variables x, y, and k. We need to find all real values of k that satisfy the given conditions. The approach is to:

1. Simplify the logarithmic expressions using logarithm properties
2. Find relationships between x and y that satisfy both equations
3. Solve for k in terms of these relationships

We'll write a Python program to numerically explore possible solutions by:
- Testing small integer values for x and y (since logs simplify nicely for these)
- Calculating k from both equations and checking consistency
- Looking for patterns in the solutions

```python
import math

def test_xy(x, y):
    if x <= 0 or y <= 0 or x == 1 or y == 1:
        return None
    
    try:
        # First equation
        term1 = math.log(y**2) / math.log(x)
        term2 = math.log(x**5) / math.log(y)
        k1 = (term1 + term2 + 1) / 2
        
        # Second equation
        term3 = math.log(y**5) / math.log(x**2)
        term4 = math.log(x**3) / math.log(y**2)
        k2 = term3 - term4 + 3
        
        # Check if both equations give same k (within floating point tolerance)
        if abs(k1 - k2) < 1e-6:
            return k1
        return None
    except:
        return None

# Test small integer values
for x in [2, 3, 4, 5, 0.5, 0.25]:
    for y in [2, 3, 4, 5, 0.5, 0.25]:
        k = test_xy(x, y)
        if k is not None:
            print(f"x={x}, y={y} → k={k}")

# Test x = y case which often simplifies problems
print("\nTesting x = y cases:")
for x in [2, 3, 4, 5, 0.5, 0.25]:
    k = test_xy(x, x)
    if k is not None:
        print(f"x=y={x} → k={k}")
```
