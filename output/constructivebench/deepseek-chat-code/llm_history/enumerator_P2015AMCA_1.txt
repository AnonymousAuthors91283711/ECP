[write_program]
The problem appears to be evaluating a specific mathematical expression involving exponents and fractions. We'll write a Python program to compute this exact value numerically. Since the expression involves real numbers, we'll use floating-point arithmetic for computation, but we'll also attempt to find an exact rational form if possible.

The expression is: 5 * ((2^0 - 1 + 5^2 - 0)^(-1))

Let's break this down:
1. 2^0 = 1
2. 1 - 1 = 0
3. 5^2 = 25
4. 0 + 25 - 0 = 25
5. 25^(-1) = 1/25
6. 5 * (1/25) = 1/5 = 0.2

The program will compute this step-by-step and output the final result.

```python
def compute_expression():
    # Compute each part of the expression step by step
    part1 = 2**0 - 1  # 1 - 1 = 0
    part2 = 5**2      # 25
    denominator = part1 + part2 - 0  # 0 + 25 - 0 = 25
    reciprocal = denominator ** (-1)  # 25^(-1) = 1/25
    result = 5 * reciprocal  # 5 * (1/25) = 1/5
    
    # Output both exact fraction and decimal approximation
    print(f"Exact value as fraction: 1/5")
    print(f"Decimal approximation: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_expression()
```
