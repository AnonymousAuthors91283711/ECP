[write_program]
This problem involves finding the rank of a specific n√ón matrix A where each entry A_ij = (i+1) + (j+1) when cast to rational numbers. The rank appears to follow a simple pattern based on n. We'll write a Python program to compute the rank for small values of n to help conjecture the general formula.

The approach:
1. Construct the matrix A for given n
2. Convert it to a matrix over rationals (or any field)
3. Compute its rank
4. Output results for n from 1 to 10

```python
import numpy as np
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_rank(n):
    # Create the matrix A where A[i][j] = (i+1)+(j+1)
    A = [[Fraction(i+1 + j+1) for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
    # Convert to numpy array for rank computation
    matrix = np.array([[float(x) for x in row] for row in A])
    return np.linalg.matrix_rank(matrix)

print("n | rank(A)")
print("--|--------")
for n in range(1, 11):
    rank = compute_rank(n)
    print(f"{n} | {rank}")
```
