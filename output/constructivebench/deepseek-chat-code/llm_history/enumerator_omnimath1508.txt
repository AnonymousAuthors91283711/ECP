This problem involves computing an infinite sum of Fibonacci numbers divided by powers of 4. We'll write a Python program to approximate this sum by computing partial sums up to a reasonable number of terms, since the terms decrease exponentially.

The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, but the denominator grows as 4^n, so the terms should converge quickly. We'll compute the sum up to n=30 terms, which should give sufficient precision.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a

def compute_sum(terms=30):
    total = 0
    for n in range(1, terms + 1):
        fib_term = fibonacci(n + 1)
        denominator = 4 ** (n + 2)
        term = fib_term / denominator
        total += term
        print(f"After term {n}: {total} (adding {term})")
    return total

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Computing partial sums of the series:")
    final_sum = compute_sum()
    print(f"\nFinal approximation after 30 terms: {final_sum}")
```
