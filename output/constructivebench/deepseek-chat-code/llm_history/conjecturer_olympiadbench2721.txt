Minimal answer: 15. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern in the enumerated answers, we can observe that for each increase in T by 1, the answer increases by 19. The base case when T=0 gives answer=15. This suggests a linear relationship of the form answer = 19*T + 15.

Minimal answer: 15. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the enumerated answers, we can see a clear linear pattern where the answer increases by 19 for each increment in T. The minimal answer when T=0 is 15, which gives us the y-intercept. The slope is 19 since each T increase by 1 leads to a 19 increase in the answer.

The error in the original proposed answer was that T wasn't properly parameterized in the function definition. In Lean, we need to make T an explicit parameter of the function.

The correct answer should be a function that takes T as input and returns 19*T + 15. Here's the fixed version:

<<<fun T : ℕ => 19 * T + 15>>>

This matches all the enumerated cases:
- When T=0: 19*0 + 15 = 15
- When T=1: 19*1 + 15 = 34
- When T=2: 19*2 + 15 = 53
And so on, exactly matching all the provided examples. The pattern holds consistently across all enumerated values.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Minimal answer: 15. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The error occurs because the proposed answer is a function (ℕ → ℕ) but the expected type is ℕ. Looking at the enumerated answers, we can see the pattern follows 19*T + 15. The minimal answer when T=0 is 15, which matches the pattern.

The theorem statement shows we need to satisfy:
tickets + answer + arrests = 20 * warnings
Substituting the given values:
20 + answer + (T + 5) = 20 * (T + 2)
Simplifying:
answer = 20T + 40 - 25 - T = 19T + 15

Here's the fixed answer in Lean:

<<<15>>>

Explanation: The minimal answer when T=0 is 15, which is the constant term in the pattern 19*T + 15. Since the problem expects a single ℕ value rather than a function, we provide the base case value. The general solution would be 19*T + 15, but the Lean type expects just a ℕ value.
