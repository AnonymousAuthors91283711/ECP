This problem involves solving a system of logarithmic equations with trigonometric functions. We'll enumerate possible (x,y) pairs in the range [0,π) that satisfy both equations. The approach involves:
1. Converting the logarithmic equations to exponential form
2. Solving for sin(x) and cos(y)
3. Checking valid solutions within the given range

```python
import math

def solve_problem():
    # We'll sample x and y values in [0, π) with small steps
    step = 0.0001
    solutions = []
    
    for x in [i * step for i in range(int(math.pi / step))]:
        for y in [i * step for i in range(int(math.pi / step))]:
            # First equation: log2(sin(x)*cos(y)) = -3/2
            eq1 = math.sin(x) * math.cos(y) - 2**(-1.5)
            
            # Second equation: log2(sin(x)/cos(y)) = 1/2
            eq2 = math.sin(x) / math.cos(y) - 2**(0.5)
            
            # Check if both equations are approximately satisfied
            if abs(eq1) < 1e-6 and abs(eq2) < 1e-6:
                solutions.append((x, y))
                print(f"Found solution: x={x:.4f}, y={y:.4f}")
    
    if solutions:
        print("\nAll solutions found:")
        for sol in solutions:
            print(f"x={sol[0]:.4f}, y={sol[1]:.4f}")
    else:
        print("No solutions found in the given range")
