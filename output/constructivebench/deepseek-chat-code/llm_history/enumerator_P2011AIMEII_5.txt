[write_program]
This problem involves finding the sum of a geometric series with given partial sums. We'll write a Python program to numerically verify the relationship between the sums and compute the required value for small parameters.

The key steps are:
1. Use the given sums to solve for 'a' and 'r'
2. Compute the third sum using these values
3. Handle the special case when r=1 separately (though the problem states r≠1)

```python
import numpy as np

def solve_geometric_series():
    # We'll use small integer values for r to find patterns
    # Since exact solution is complex, we'll approximate numerically
    print("Trying different r values near the likely solution:")
    
    # Target sums
    S1 = 200
    S2 = 380
    
    # Function to compute sum of geometric series
    def geo_sum(a, r, n):
        if r == 1:
            return a * n
        return a * (1 - r**n) / (1 - r)
    
    # Numerical solver to find r
    def find_r():
        # We know r ≠ 1 and likely between 0 and 1
        for r in np.linspace(0.1, 0.99, 50):
            try:
                # Solve for a from first equation
                n1 = 2011
                a = S1 * (1 - r) / (1 - r**n1)
                
                # Verify with second equation
                n2 = 4022
                computed_S2 = geo_sum(a, r, n2)
                if abs(computed_S2 - S2) < 1e-6:
                    return r, a
            except:
                continue
        return None, None
    
    r, a = find_r()
    if r is not None:
        print(f"Found approximate solution: r = {r:.6f}, a = {a:.6f}")
        
        # Compute the required sum
        n3 = 6033
        S3 = geo_sum(a, r, n3)
        print(f"Sum for n=6033: {S3:.6f}")
    else:
        print("No solution found in the tested range")

solve_geometric_series()
