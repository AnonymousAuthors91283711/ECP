[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number n such that 2/(2^n) < 0.1. We can solve this by enumerating natural numbers starting from 1 and checking the inequality until we find the smallest n that satisfies it.

The program will:
1. Start checking from n=1 upwards
2. For each n, compute 2/(2^n)
3. Check if this value is less than 0.1
4. Print each candidate n that satisfies the inequality
5. Stop after finding the smallest such n (which will be the answer)

```python
def main():
    threshold = 0.1
    n = 1
    while True:
        value = 2.0 / (2 ** n)
        if value < threshold:
            print(f"Found candidate n = {n} with value {value}")
            print(f"Smallest n satisfying the inequality is {n}")
            break
        n += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
