Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => (a + b) / Nat.gcd a b
Proposed Answer: fun a b => if a = b then 0 else if (a + b).gcd a == 1 then a + b else 0
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the least positive integer k such that iterating a certain function k times brings 0 back to 0.

2. The ground truth answer is (a + b) / gcd(a, b), which makes sense because:
   - The function alternates between adding a and subtracting b
   - The period should relate to when these operations balance out
   - This matches known results about such periodic systems

3. The proposed answer has several issues:
   - It returns 0 when a = b, but k must be positive (0 < k in the problem)
   - The condition (a + b).gcd a == 1 is not equivalent to gcd(a, b) = 1
   - It returns 0 in the else case, which is incorrect
   - The structure doesn't match the ground truth

The proposed answer is fundamentally different from the ground truth and contains multiple errors.
