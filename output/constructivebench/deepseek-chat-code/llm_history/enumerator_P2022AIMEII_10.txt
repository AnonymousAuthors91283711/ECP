[write_program]
This problem involves computing a sum of combinations modulo 1000. We'll write a Python program to calculate the exact sum and find its remainder when divided by 1000. The sum is over i from 3 to 40, where each term is the combination of C(i,2) choose 2.

```python
import math

def combination(n, k):
    if k < 0 or k > n:
        return 0
    return math.comb(n, k)

def compute_sum():
    total = 0
    for i in range(3, 41):
        term = combination(combination(i, 2), 2)
        total += term
    return total % 1000

result = compute_sum()
print(result)
```
