[write_program]
The problem is asking to find a natural number `d` such that `10*d + 8 = 528`, and then compute `2*d` as the answer. This is a simple linear equation that can be solved directly. We'll write a Python program to verify the solution by checking possible values of `d` up to a reasonable threshold.

```python
# Find d such that 10*d + 8 = 528, then compute 2*d
threshold = 100  # More than enough for this problem

for d in range(threshold):
    if 10 * d + 8 == 528:
        print(f"Found d={d}, answer={2*d}")
        break
```
