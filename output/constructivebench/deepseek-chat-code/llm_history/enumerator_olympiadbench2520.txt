This problem asks for the smallest positive integer x such that x divided by some power of 10 equals 1/32. We need to find x and y where x/10^y = 1/32. 

The approach is to:
1. Rewrite the equation as x = 10^y / 32
2. Find the smallest y where 10^y is divisible by 32 (since x must be integer)
3. The smallest such y is 5 because 10^5 = 100000 which is divisible by 32 (100000/32 = 3125)
4. Therefore x = 3125 is the minimal solution

The Python program will verify this by checking increasing powers of 10 until we find the first integer solution.

```python
def find_min_x():
    y = 1
    while True:
        numerator = 10 ** y
        if numerator % 32 == 0:
            x = numerator // 32
            print(f"Found solution: x = {x} with y = {y}")
            print(f"Minimal x is: {x}")
            return
        y += 1

find_min_x()
```
