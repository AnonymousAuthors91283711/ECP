Based on the functional equation and positivity condition, the solution appears to be a reciprocal function. The equation suggests a relationship between multiplication and addition that's characteristic of reciprocal functions. The simplest function satisfying f(x * f(x + y)) = y * f(x) + 1 with f(x) > 0 for x > 0 is:

<<<fun x : ℝ => 1 / x>>>
