[write_program]
The problem asks to find all even numbers n > 2 that cannot be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers (violating Goldbach's conjecture). We'll write a Python program to enumerate such numbers up to a reasonable threshold.

```python
def is_prime(num):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if num < 2:
        return False
    if num in (2, 3):
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(num**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def can_be_sum_of_two_primes(n):
    """Check if n can be expressed as sum of two primes."""
    for p in range(2, n // 2 + 1):
        q = n - p
        if is_prime(p) and is_prime(q):
            return True
    return False

def find_violating_numbers(limit=100):
    """Find even numbers >2 that can't be expressed as sum of two primes."""
    results = []
    for n in range(4, limit + 1, 2):
        if not can_be_sum_of_two_primes(n):
            results.append(n)
            print(n)  # Stream partial results
    
    if results:
        print(f"Numbers violating Goldbach's conjecture up to {limit}: {results}")
    else:
        print(f"No violations found up to {limit}")

find_violating_numbers()
```
