Ground Truth Answer: fun (a, b) => a + b
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℕ × ℕ => if p.1 = 5 ∧ p.2 = 16 ∨ p.1 = 16 ∧ p.2 = 5 then 21 else 0
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is asking for a function that returns 21 when the equation equals 1200, and presumably something else otherwise.

2. The ground truth answer suggests that a + b is the condition for when the equation holds (i.e., when a + b = 21).

3. The proposed answer only returns 21 for two specific pairs (5,16) and (16,5), and 0 otherwise.

4. The ground truth would return 21 for any pair where a + b = 21 (e.g., (1,20), (10,11), etc.), while the proposed answer only works for those two specific cases.

5. The proposed answer is correct for those two cases (since 5+16=21), but incorrect for all other pairs that sum to 21.

Therefore, the proposed answer is partially correct but fails to generalize to all valid cases.
