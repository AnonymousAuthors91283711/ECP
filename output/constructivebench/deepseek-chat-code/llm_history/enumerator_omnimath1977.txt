[write_program]
This problem involves solving an exponential equation and then evaluating another exponential expression based on the solution. We'll write a Python program to numerically approximate the solution and verify the result.

The steps are:
1. Solve 2^x = 3 for x (which is log₂3)
2. Compute 4^(3x + 2) using the found x value
3. Simplify the expression to find the exact value

```python
import math

# Solve 2^x = 3 to find x = log2(3)
x = math.log2(3)

# Compute 4^(3x + 2)
result = 4 ** (3 * x + 2)

# Print intermediate values and final result
print(f"x = log2(3) ≈ {x}")
print(f"4^(3x + 2) ≈ {result}")

# Exact value calculation: 4^(3*log2(3) + 2) = 4^(3*log2(3)) * 4^2
# = (2^2)^(3*log2(3)) * 16 = 2^(6*log2(3)) * 16 = 3^6 * 16 = 729 * 16
exact_value = 729 * 16
print(f"Exact value: {exact_value}")
```
