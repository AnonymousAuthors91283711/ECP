[write_program]
This problem involves finding a closed-form expression for a sequence defined by a recurrence relation. The theorem states that for any positive integer k, the answer is given by the formula 1/6 + 1/(3 * (-2)^k). To verify this, we'll write a Python program that:

1. Computes the sequence values using the recurrence relation
2. Compares them with the closed-form formula
3. Prints both values for small k to show they match

The program will help confirm the correctness of the theorem by showing agreement between the recurrence-based computation and the closed-form expression for small values of k.

```python
def compute_recurrence(k_max=10):
    # Initialize the recurrence values
    a = [0.0] * (k_max + 1)
    a[0] = 0.0
    a[1] = 0.5
    
    # Compute recurrence values
    for k in range(2, k_max + 1):
        a[k] = (a[k-1] + 1) / (-2)
    
    # Compute closed-form values and compare
    for k in range(1, k_max + 1):
        closed_form = 1/6 + 1/(3 * ((-2)**k))
        print(f"k={k}: recurrence={a[k]:.10f}, closed_form={closed_form:.10f}")

compute_recurrence()
```
