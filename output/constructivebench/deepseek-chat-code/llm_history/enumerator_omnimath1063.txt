[write_program]
This problem asks to find all real solutions to the equation:
(2x + 1)(3x + 1)(5x + 1)(30x + 1) = 10

We'll write a Python program to numerically approximate the real roots of this equation. The approach will be:
1. Expand the polynomial equation
2. Find roots numerically within a reasonable range
3. Print each root found with sufficient precision

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.polynomial import Polynomial

def find_roots():
    # Expand (2x+1)(3x+1)(5x+1)(30x+1) - 10 = 0
    p1 = Polynomial([1, 2])
    p2 = Polynomial([1, 3])
    p3 = Polynomial([1, 5])
    p4 = Polynomial([1, 30])
    poly = p1 * p2 * p3 * p4 - 10
    
    # Find all real roots in a reasonable range
    roots = poly.roots()
    real_roots = [root for root in roots if np.isreal(root)]
    
    # Print each root with 6 decimal places
    for root in real_roots:
        print(f"{np.real(root):.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_roots()
```
