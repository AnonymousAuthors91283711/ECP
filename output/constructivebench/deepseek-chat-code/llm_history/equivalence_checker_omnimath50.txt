Ground Truth Answer: { f : ℝ → ℝ | (∃ a b : ℝ, ∀ x, f x = a * x + b) ∨ (∃ a b c : ℝ, a ≤ 0 ∧ ∀ x, f x = a * x^2 + b * x + c) }
Proposed Answer: { f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ (a b c : ℝ), (∀ x, f x = a * x^2 + b * x + c) ∧ a ≤ 0 }

The proposed answer is mostly correct but misses the linear case (first disjunct in the ground truth answer). The ground truth includes both quadratic functions with a ≤ 0 and all linear functions, while the proposed answer only includes quadratic functions with a ≤ 0. The linear case (a = 0) is technically covered in the proposed answer, but the explicit inclusion of linear functions makes the ground truth more complete and clearer.
