The problem is to compute the exact rational value of (3*84 + 4*70)/7. We'll calculate this directly in Python using exact fractions to avoid floating-point approximations.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Calculate (3*84 + 4*70)/7 exactly using fractions
numerator = 3 * 84 + 4 * 70
denominator = 7
result = Fraction(numerator, denominator)

# Print the exact simplified fraction
print(result)
```
