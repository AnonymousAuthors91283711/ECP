open Complex Polynomial

abbrev omnimath1776_answer : Set ℂ := sorry
theorem omnimath1776 (x : ℂ) : 
    x^4 + 2 * x^3 + 2 * x^2 + 2 * x + 1 = 0 ↔ x ∈ omnimath1776_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Roots and their polynomial evaluations:
Root: 0.00000000+1.00000000j
Verification: -1.11e-15-4.44e-15j (should be close to 0)
Root: 0.00000000-1.00000000j
Verification: -1.11e-15+4.44e-15j (should be close to 0)
Root: -1.00000000+0.00000001j
Verification: 2.22e-16-1.65e-23j (should be close to 0)
Root: -1.00000000-0.00000001j
Verification: 2.22e-16+1.65e-23j (should be close to 0). Expected Answer Type: Set ℂ
