[write_program]
This problem is about determining whether there exist positive integers a and b such that for all positive integers n, a does not divide (b^n - n). The Lean theorem states this is equivalent to some answer (omnimath36_answer). We'll write a Python program to search for such pairs (a,b) for small values.

The approach is to:
1. Iterate through small values of a and b
2. For each pair, test divisibility for small n values
3. If any n makes a divide (b^n - n), the pair fails the condition
4. Track pairs that satisfy the condition for all tested n

```python
def main():
    max_a = 20
    max_b = 20
    max_n = 20  # Test up to this n value
    
    for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
        for b in range(1, max_b + 1):
            valid = True
            for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
                if (pow(b, n, a) - n % a) % a == 0:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                print(f"Found candidate pair: a={a}, b={b}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
