[write_program]
This problem involves evaluating a simple arithmetic expression (2^4 - 2)/(2^3 - 1) and finding its exact value. The solution is straightforward computation, but we'll write a Python program to verify it systematically.

The approach is:
1. Compute numerator (2^4 - 2)
2. Compute denominator (2^3 - 1)
3. Divide numerator by denominator
4. Check if result is integer (which it should be based on the problem statement)

```python
def compute_expression():
    numerator = (2**4) - 2
    denominator = (2**3) - 1
    result = numerator / denominator
    
    print(f"Numerator: {numerator}")
    print(f"Denominator: {denominator}")
    print(f"Result: {result}")
    
    if result.is_integer():
        print(f"Integer result: {int(result)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_expression()
```
