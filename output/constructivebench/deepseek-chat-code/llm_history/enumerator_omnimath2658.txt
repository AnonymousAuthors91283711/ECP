[write_program]
This problem asks for the count of natural numbers n where 0 < n < 10! that can be expressed as the sum of four factorials (a! + b! + c! + d!). We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such numbers efficiently.

Key optimizations:
1. Precompute factorials up to 9! since 10! is our upper bound
2. Use combinations with replacement to avoid duplicate sums from different orderings
3. Store results in a set to automatically handle duplicates

```python
import itertools

def main():
    # Precompute factorials up to 9! (since 10! is our upper bound)
    factorials = [1]
    for i in range(1, 10):
        factorials.append(factorials[-1] * i)
    
    seen = set()
    # Generate all combinations of 4 factorials (with replacement)
    for combo in itertools.combinations_with_replacement(factorials, 4):
        total = sum(combo)
        if 0 < total < 3628800:  # 3628800 is 10!
            seen.add(total)
    
    # Print all found numbers sorted
    for num in sorted(seen):
        print(num)
    
    # Print the count
    print(f"Total numbers found: {len(seen)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
