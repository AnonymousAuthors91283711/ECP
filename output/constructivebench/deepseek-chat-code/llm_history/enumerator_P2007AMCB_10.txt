[write_program]
The problem is to find a natural number `total` that satisfies several conditions:
1. `total > 0`
2. `2 * total` is divisible by 5 (i.e., `2 * total % 5 = 0`)
3. The equation `(2 * total / 5 - 2) * 10 = 3 * (total - 2 + 2)` must hold
4. The value `2 * total / 5` should be the answer we're seeking

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of `total` and check these conditions. The program will stop when it finds the smallest valid `total` (since natural numbers are positive integers).

```python
def find_total():
    # We'll search for total starting from 1 upwards
    total = 1
    while True:
        # Check if 2*total is divisible by 5
        if (2 * total) % 5 == 0:
            # Calculate the left and right sides of the equation
            left = (2 * total // 5 - 2) * 10
            right = 3 * (total - 2 + 2)  # Simplified to 3*total
            if left == right:
                answer = 2 * total // 5
                print(f"Found valid total: {total}, answer: {answer}")
                print(f"Final answer: {answer}")
                return
        total += 1

find_total()
```
