Ground Truth Answer: 20 / 3
Proposed Answer: 5 / 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two equations:
   - 4a² + 9b² = 20
   - (2a + 3b)² = 20 + 12ab

2. Let's expand the second equation:
   (2a + 3b)² = 4a² + 12ab + 9b² = 20 + 12ab

3. From the first equation, we know 4a² + 9b² = 20, so we can substitute:
   20 + 12ab = 20 + 12ab

4. This simplifies to 0 = 0, which doesn't give us new information. We need another approach.

5. Let's consider the first equation 4a² + 9b² = 20. We can think of this as (2a)² + (3b)² = 20.

6. Let x = 2a and y = 3b, then x² + y² = 20.

7. The product we want is a*b = (x/2)*(y/3) = xy/6.

8. From the second condition, (x + y)² = 20 + 2xy.

9. Expanding: x² + 2xy + y² = 20 + 2xy → 20 + 2xy = 20 + 2xy → again 0=0.

10. The maximum product xy occurs when x = y = √10 (from x² + y² = 20), giving xy = 10.

11. Therefore, maximum a*b = 10/6 = 5/3, but this is the maximum, not necessarily the actual value.

12. The ground truth answer is 20/3 ≈ 6.666..., which is larger than our maximum possible value of 5/3 ≈ 1.666..., so it must be incorrect.

13. The proposed answer is 5/9 ≈ 0.555..., which is within possible range but doesn't match our maximum.

14. Neither answer seems correct based on this analysis. The problem might have additional constraints not shown here.
