abbrev omnimath3802_answer : Set (ℝ → ℝ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3802
: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x y : ℝ, (f (f x - y)) * (f (x + f y)) = x ^ 2 - y ^ 2} = omnimath3802_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found solution: f(x) = 1x + 0
Enumeration complete. The only likely solutions are linear functions.. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
<<<{f | ∃ a : ℝ, f = fun x => a * x}>>>
