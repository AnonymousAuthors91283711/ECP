abbrev omnimath2804_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2804 :
  let sequences := {f : Fin 11 → ℝ | f 0 = 4 ∧ f 10 = 1024 ∧ 
    ∀ n ∈ Finset.Icc 1 10, f n + f (n-1) = 5/2 * Real.sqrt (f n * f (n-1))}
  Nat.card (Subtype sequences) ≡ omnimath2804_answer [MOD 100] := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Total sequences found: 0
Answer mod 100: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the enumerated answers showing 0 sequences and the problem's constraints involving a recurrence relation with square roots, the only possible solution is that no valid sequences exist. The modulo 100 result is consistently 0.
