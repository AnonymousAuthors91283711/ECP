noncomputable abbrev omnimath3452_answer : Fin 3 → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3452 :
  (∀ i : Fin 3, omnimath3452_answer i < omnimath3452_answer (i + 1)) ∧
  (∀ x : ℝ, (x = Real.sqrt 2011 ∨ x = 2011 ∨ x = 2011 ^ 2) → (∃! i : Fin 3, x = omnimath3452_answer i)) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun i => if i = 0 then Real.sqrt 2011 else 2011 ^ (i : ℕ)
Proposed Answer: fun i => match i with | 0 => Real.sqrt 2011 | 1 => 2011 | 2 => 2011^2
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. The ground truth answer uses a conditional expression to return:
   - Real.sqrt 2011 when i=0
   - 2011^i for i=1,2 (since Fin 3 has values 0,1,2)

2. The proposed answer uses pattern matching to return:
   - Real.sqrt 2011 when i=0
   - 2011 when i=1
   - 2011^2 when i=2

These are exactly equivalent because:
- For i=0: Both return Real.sqrt 2011
- For i=1: 2011^1 = 2011
- For i=2: 2011^2 = 2011^2

The proposed answer is just an explicit enumeration of the cases that would result from the ground truth answer's general formula. Both satisfy the theorem's requirements of strictly increasing values and unique mapping of the specified real numbers.
