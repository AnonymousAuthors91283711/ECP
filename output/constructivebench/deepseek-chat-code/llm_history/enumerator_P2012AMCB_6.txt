[write_program]
The problem asks to determine when the inequality (x + ε) - (y - ε) > x - y holds given x > y > 0 and ε > 0. We can simplify this inequality algebraically to find the condition. The Python program will enumerate small rational values for x, y, and ε to observe patterns and verify the simplified condition.

```python
def main():
    # Test small rational values for x, y, ε where x > y > 0 and ε > 0
    test_values = [
        (3, 2, 1),   # x=3, y=2, ε=1
        (5, 3, 0.5), # x=5, y=3, ε=0.5
        (4, 1, 2),   # x=4, y=1, ε=2
        (10, 9, 0.1) # x=10, y=9, ε=0.1
    ]
    
    for x, y, ε in test_values:
        # Original inequality: (x + ε) - (y - ε) > x - y
        # Simplified to: 2ε > 0 which is always true since ε > 0
        result = (x + ε) - (y - ε) > x - y
        print(f"x={x}, y={y}, ε={ε}: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
