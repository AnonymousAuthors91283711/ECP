This problem involves counting subsets of a Cartesian product where the projection to the first component has odd cardinality. We'll approach it by:

1. Understanding the combinatorial structure
2. Enumerating smaller cases to identify a pattern
3. Implementing an efficient counting mechanism

For the enumeration, we'll use small values of n (size of first set) and k (size of second set) to observe patterns. The key observation is that for each subset of the first component with odd size, we have complete freedom in choosing elements from the second component.

```python
def count_odd_projection_sets(n, k):
    """
    Counts subsets S of {0..n-1} Ã— {0..k-1} where the projection to first component has odd size.
    For each odd-sized subset of first component (there are 2^(n-1) such subsets),
    we can choose any subset of the second component for each element (2^k choices per element).
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    # Number of odd-sized subsets of first component: 2^(n-1)
    odd_subsets = 1 << (n - 1)
    # For each element in the subset, we have 2^k choices in second component
    return odd_subsets * (1 << k)

# Enumerate small cases to observe pattern
for n in range(1, 6):
    for k in range(1, 4):
        print(f"n={n}, k={k}: {count_odd_projection_sets(n, k)}")

# The original problem has n=2014, k=4
# The pattern shows the answer is 2^(n-1 + k)
# So for n=2014, k=4: 2^(2013 + 4) = 2^2017
# But we don't print this as we're only enumerating small cases
```
