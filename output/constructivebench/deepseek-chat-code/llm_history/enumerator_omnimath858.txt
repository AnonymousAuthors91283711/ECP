This problem asks for the number of fixed-point-free involutions (derangements that are their own inverse) on a set of 10 elements. We'll enumerate this by counting the number of ways to pair up 10 distinct elements where no element is paired with itself.

The solution involves calculating the number of perfect matchings in a complete graph with 10 vertices where no vertex is matched to itself. This is equivalent to (10-1)!! (double factorial) for deranged pairings.

```python
import math

def count_deranged_involutions(n):
    """Count fixed-point-free involutions (deranged pairings) of n elements."""
    if n % 2 != 0:
        return 0  # Must have even number of elements
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        result *= i
    return result

# For n=10 (the problem's case)
n = 10
print(f"Number of deranged involutions for n={n}: {count_deranged_involutions(n)}")

# Show progression for smaller even n values to demonstrate the pattern
print("\nShowing pattern for smaller even n values:")
for k in range(2, n+1, 2):
    print(f"n={k}: {count_deranged_involutions(k)}")
```
