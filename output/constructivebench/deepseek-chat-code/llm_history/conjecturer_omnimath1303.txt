theorem omnimath1303 : 
  ∑ k in Finset.range 100, (1 / (2 * ⌊sqrt (k + 1 : ℝ)⌋ + 1 : ℚ)) = omnimath1303_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: After 10 terms: 16/7
After 20 terms: 32/9
After 30 terms: 50/11
After 40 terms: 70/13
After 50 terms: 92/15
After 60 terms: 34/5
After 70 terms: 126/17
After 80 terms: 8
After 90 terms: 162/19
After 100 terms: 190/21

Final exact result:
190/21. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Looking at the enumerated answers, the denominators follow the pattern 7,9,11,13,... (odd numbers starting from 7) while numerators are perfect squares minus 1 (16=4², 32≈5.66², 50≈7.07², etc.). For n=100 terms, the answer is 190/21 where 21=2*10+1 and 190=10*19. The general pattern appears to be n²/(2n+1) where n is the integer part of √100=10.
