Ground Truth Answer: 195
Proposed Answer: 1430 / 16 + (1430 / 16 + 15 * 2) + (1430 / 16 + 7 * 2)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives two equations about an arithmetic sequence:
   - h₁: n(2a + (n-1)d) = 1430 (sum of first n terms)
   - h₂: n(2a + (n-1)d) + n² = 1672 (sum of first n terms plus n²)

2. From h₁ and h₂, we can solve for n:
   1430 + n² = 1672 ⇒ n² = 242 ⇒ n = 16 (since n is natural)

3. The ground truth answer is 195, which is the correct solution to the problem.

4. The proposed answer attempts to calculate:
   - First term: 1430/16 ≈ 89.375
   - Last term: 1430/16 + 15*2 ≈ 119.375
   - Middle term: 1430/16 + 7*2 ≈ 103.375
   - Sum: ≈ 89.375 + 119.375 + 103.375 ≈ 312.125

This doesn't match the ground truth answer of 195. The proposed answer makes incorrect assumptions about the arithmetic sequence's parameters and calculations.
