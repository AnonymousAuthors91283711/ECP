[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of integer 7-tuples (n1, n2, n3, n4, n5, n6, n7) that satisfy the equation n1^6 + n2^6 + ... + n7^6 = 96957. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible combinations by considering the range of possible integer values for each variable.

The approach:
1. Calculate maximum possible absolute value for any variable (since 7*max^6 must be â‰¥ 96957)
2. Generate all possible combinations of 7 integers within this range
3. Count combinations where the sum of sixth powers equals 96957
4. Since order matters (n1,n2,... vs n2,n1,...), we'll count all permutations as distinct

```python
def main():
    target = 96957
    max_n = int((target // 7) ** (1/6)) + 2  # Upper bound for absolute value
    
    count = 0
    # We'll iterate through all possible combinations with n1 <= n2 <= ... <= n7
    # to avoid duplicate counting of permutations, then multiply by multiplicity
    from itertools import combinations_with_replacement
    
    for combo in combinations_with_replacement(range(-max_n, max_n + 1), 7):
        total = sum(x**6 for x in combo)
        if total == target:
            # Calculate number of distinct permutations of this combination
            from collections import Counter
            freq = Counter(combo)
            permutations = 1
            remaining = 7
            for v in freq.values():
                # Compute permutations = 7! / (count1! * count2! * ...)
                for i in range(1, v + 1):
                    permutations = permutations * remaining // i
                    remaining -= 1
            count += permutations
            print(f"Found combination: {combo} (adds {permutations} solutions)")
    
    print(f"Total number of solutions: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
