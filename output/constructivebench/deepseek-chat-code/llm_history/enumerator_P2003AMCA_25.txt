This problem asks for the number of real values `a` such that there exists a positive real `b` where the set defined by the inequality `a*x² + b*x ≥ 0` equals the range of the function `sqrt(a*x² + b*x)`. 

To enumerate possible solutions:
1. The inequality `a*x² + b*x ≥ 0` defines the domain where the square root is real.
2. The range of `sqrt(a*x² + b*x)` is `[0, ∞)` when the quadratic can take all non-negative values.
3. We need to find all `a` where these two sets match.

We'll test small integer values of `a` to find valid cases where such `b` exists.

```python
import math

def check_a(a):
    # For a=0: b*x ≥ 0 for x in domain, range is [0,∞) when b>0. Sets match.
    if a == 0:
        return True
    
    # For a>0: parabola opens upwards. Need minimum value ≤0 to cover [0,∞)
    if a > 0:
        # The minimum occurs at x = -b/(2a), value is -b²/(4a)
        # For range to be [0,∞), minimum must be ≤0 (always true for b>0)
        # The inequality a*x² + b*x ≥0 holds when x≤0 or x≥-b/a
        # For sets to match, the domain must be all reals (which it isn't)
        # So no solutions for a>0
        return False
    
    # For a<0: parabola opens downwards. Need maximum ≥0 and proper domain
    if a < 0:
        # Maximum occurs at x = -b/(2a), value is -b²/(4a) (positive since a<0)
        # Inequality holds between roots: x ∈ [0, -b/a]
        # For range to match [0,√(maximum)], the inequality domain must be exactly [0, -b/a]
        # and maximum must be unbounded (impossible for a<0)
        # Only possible if a=-1, b=2 (special case where range is [0,1] and domain is [0,2])
        # But this doesn't give full [0,∞) range
        # Actually only a=0 works
        return False
    
    return False

count = 0
for a in range(-5, 6):  # Test small integer values
    if check_a(a):
        print(f"Valid a found: {a}")
        count += 1

print(f"Total valid a values: {count}")
```
