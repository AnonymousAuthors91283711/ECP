[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of equations to find coefficients a_i that satisfy given conditions, then evaluating a related sum. We'll write a Python program to numerically approximate the solution by setting up and solving the linear system.

The approach:
1. Set up the system of 5 equations for k=1..5
2. Solve for the coefficients a_i
3. Compute the desired sum with k=37

```python
import numpy as np

def solve_omnimath1628():
    # Set up the system of equations
    n = 5
    A = np.zeros((n, n))
    b = np.zeros(n)
    
    for k in range(1, n+1):
        for i in range(n):
            A[k-1, i] = 1 / (k**2 + i)
        b[k-1] = 1 / k**2
    
    # Solve for coefficients a_i
    a = np.linalg.solve(A, b)
    
    # Compute the desired sum for k=37
    result = 0.0
    for i in range(n):
        result += a[i] / (37 + i)
    
    print(f"Coefficients a_i: {a}")
    print(f"Sum for k=37: {result}")

solve_omnimath1628()
```
