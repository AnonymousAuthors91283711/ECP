[write_program]
This problem defines a recursive function f(x,y) with base cases f(x,0)=0 and f(0,y)=0, and a recursive rule for x,y â‰¥ 0. We'll enumerate values of f(x,y) for small x and y to identify the pattern and conjecture the general formula.

The recursive relation suggests computing f(x,y) using dynamic programming. We'll build a table of values for x,y up to 6,12 to observe the pattern.

```python
def compute_f(max_x, max_y):
    # Initialize DP table with base cases
    dp = [[0] * (max_y + 1) for _ in range(max_x + 1)]
    
    for x in range(1, max_x + 1):
        for y in range(1, max_y + 1):
            dp[x][y] = dp[x-1][y] + dp[x][y-1] + x + y
    
    # Print all computed values
    for x in range(1, max_x + 1):
        for y in range(1, max_y + 1):
            print(f"f({x}, {y}) = {dp[x][y]}")
    
    return dp[max_x][max_y]

# Compute up to f(6,12) while printing intermediate results
print("Computing f(x,y) values:")
result = compute_f(6, 12)
print(f"\nFinal computed value f(6,12) = {result}")
```
