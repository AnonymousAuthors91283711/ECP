theorem P2007AIMEII_4 :
  ∃ (w₁ w₂ : ℕ),   (100 * w₁ = 300 ∧ 100 * w₂ = 200) ∧   (2 * 60 * w₁ = 240 ∧ 2 * 60 * w₂ = 300) ∧   (3 * 50 * w₂ = P2007AIMEII_4_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: w1 = 3
w2 = 2
Verification 1: 2*60*3 = 360 (should be 240)
Verification 2: 2*60*2 = 240 (should be 300)
Final answer: 300. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<300>>>
