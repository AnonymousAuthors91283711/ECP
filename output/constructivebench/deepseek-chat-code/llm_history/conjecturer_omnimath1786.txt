Based on the problem statement and the condition (a-20)(b+23) = a*b when a < b, we can solve for b in terms of a. The equation simplifies to b = (20a)/(a-43) when a > 43. The smallest integer solution occurs when a=44, giving b=880. Thus:

<<<924>>> 

Explanation: For a=44, b=880 satisfies the equation (44-20)(880+23)=44*880, and their sum 44+880=924 is minimal.
