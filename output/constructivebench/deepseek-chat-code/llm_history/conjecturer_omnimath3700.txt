abbrev omnimath3700_answer : Set (ℝ → ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3700 :
  {f : ℝ → ℤ | ∀ x y : ℝ, (f (f y - x)) ^ 2 + f x ^ 2 + f y ^ 2 = f y * (1 + 2 * f (f y))} = omnimath3700_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing constant functions:
Found constant solution: f(x) = 0
Found constant solution: f(x) = 1

Testing linear functions:. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℤ)
Based on the enumerated answers showing constant solutions 0 and 1, and the problem's functional equation structure, the solution appears to be the set of constant integer functions that satisfy the equation. The pattern suggests only 0 and 1 work as constant solutions.
