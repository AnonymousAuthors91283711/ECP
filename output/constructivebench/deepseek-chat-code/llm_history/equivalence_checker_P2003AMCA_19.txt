abbrev P2003AMCA_19_answer : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem P2003AMCA_19 (a b c : ℝ) (ha : a ≠ 0) :
  (let f := fun x => a*(x-5)^2 + b*(x-5) + c
   let g := fun x => -a*(x+5)^2 - b*(x+5) - c
   (f + g) = P2003AMCA_19_answer a b c) ∧ 
  10 * b ≠ 0 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a b c x => 10 * b * x + (50 * b + 2 * c)
Proposed Answer: fun a b c x => -20 * a * x - 10 * b
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines two functions f(x) and g(x), then asks for their sum (f+g)(x).

2. Calculating (f+g)(x):
   f(x) = a*(x-5)² + b*(x-5) + c
   g(x) = -a*(x+5)² - b*(x+5) - c
   (f+g)(x) = a[(x-5)² - (x+5)²] + b[(x-5) - (x+5)] + [c - c]

3. Simplifying:
   (x-5)² - (x+5)² = (x²-10x+25) - (x²+10x+25) = -20x
   (x-5) - (x+5) = -10
   So (f+g)(x) = a*(-20x) + b*(-10) = -20a*x - 10b

4. Comparing with answers:
   - Ground truth: 10*b*x + (50*b + 2*c) (incorrect)
   - Proposed: -20*a*x - 10*b (correct)

The ground truth answer is incorrect as it doesn't match our derivation, while the proposed answer matches exactly what we derived. The 'c' terms correctly cancel out, and the coefficients for 'a' and 'b' are correct in the proposed answer.
