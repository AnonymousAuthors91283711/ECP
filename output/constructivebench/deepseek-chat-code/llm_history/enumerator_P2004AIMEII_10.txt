[write_program]
This problem involves counting binary numbers with exactly two '1' bits that are divisible by 9, then calculating the probability ratio. We'll write a Python program to enumerate such numbers up to a reasonable size to observe the pattern.

The approach:
1. Generate all numbers with exactly two '1' bits in binary (numbers of form 2^a + 2^b where a > b)
2. Count how many are divisible by 9
3. Calculate the probability ratio
4. Observe the pattern for small exponents before it becomes computationally intensive

```python
def enumerate_probability(max_exp=20):
    total = 0
    divisible = 0
    
    # Generate all numbers with exactly two 1 bits
    for a in range(1, max_exp + 1):
        for b in range(a):
            num = (1 << a) + (1 << b)
            total += 1
            if num % 9 == 0:
                divisible += 1
                print(f"Found: {num} (2^{a} + 2^{b})")
    
    if total > 0:
        print(f"Total numbers: {total}")
        print(f"Divisible by 9: {divisible}")
        # Print simplified fraction
        from math import gcd
        g = gcd(divisible, total)
        p = divisible // g
        q = total // g
        print(f"Probability: {p}/{q}")
        print(f"p + q = {p + q}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_probability()
```
