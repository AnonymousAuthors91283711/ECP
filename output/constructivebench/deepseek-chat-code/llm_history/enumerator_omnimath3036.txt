This problem involves finding digits K, L, M, N (each between 0-9) that satisfy the equation derived from the subtraction problem. The equation simplifies to 6000 + 100K + L - (900 + 1000M + 10N + 4) = 2011. We'll enumerate all possible combinations of K, L, M, N (0-9) to find valid solutions and compute K+L+M+N for each.

```python
def solve():
    # The equation simplifies to: 100K + L - 1000M - 10N = 2011 - 6000 + 900 + 4
    # Which becomes: 100K + L - 1000M - 10N = -3085
    # Or: 1000M - 100K + 10N - L = 3085
    solutions = []
    for K in range(10):
        for L in range(10):
            for M in range(10):
                for N in range(10):
                    left = 1000*M - 100*K + 10*N - L
                    if left == 3085:
                        sum_klmn = K + L + M + N
                        print(f"Found solution: K={K}, L={L}, M={M}, N={N}, sum={sum_klmn}")
                        solutions.append(sum_klmn)
    
    if solutions:
        print("All possible sums K+L+M+N:", solutions)
        print("Minimum sum:", min(solutions))
        print("Maximum sum:", max(solutions))
    else:
        print("No solutions found")

solve()
