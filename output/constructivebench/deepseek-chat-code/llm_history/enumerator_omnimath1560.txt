[write_program]
This problem asks for the largest natural number `n` such that there exists a function `X` from `{1,...,n}` to finite subsets of natural numbers, where for any three indices `a < b < c`, the cardinality of `X(a) ∪ X(b) ∪ X(c)` equals the ceiling of the square root of `a*b*c`.

We'll write a Python program to search for such `n` by:
1. Trying small values of `n` in increasing order
2. For each `n`, attempting to construct suitable sets `X(1),...,X(n)`
3. Checking the union cardinality condition for all triples `a < b < c`

```python
import math
from itertools import combinations

def find_max_n(max_trial=10):
    for n in range(1, max_trial + 1):
        # Try to find suitable X for current n
        found = False
        # We'll represent X as list of sets, starting with minimal elements
        # Since exact construction is complex, we'll try small sets first
        for size in range(1, 10):  # Try sets with up to 'size' elements
            from itertools import product
            # Generate all possible combinations of n sets with elements up to size
            for sets in product([frozenset(range(s)) for s in range(size+1)], repeat=n):
                valid = True
                # Check all triples a < b < c
                for a, b, c in combinations(range(n), 3):
                    union = sets[a] | sets[b] | sets[c]
                    required = math.ceil(math.sqrt((a+1)*(b+1)*(c+1)))
                    if len(union) != required:
                        valid = False
                        break
                if valid:
                    print(f"Found solution for n={n}: {[set(s) for s in sets]}")
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if not found:
            print(f"No solution found for n={n}")
            return n - 1
    return max_trial

print("Searching for maximum n...")
max_n = find_max_n(10)
print(f"Largest n found: {max_n}")
```

Note: This program uses a brute-force approach with several limitations:
1. It only checks small set sizes (up to 9 elements)
2. It stops at n=10 for demonstration
3. The output shows constructed sets when found
The actual mathematical solution likely requires deeper combinatorial reasoning.
