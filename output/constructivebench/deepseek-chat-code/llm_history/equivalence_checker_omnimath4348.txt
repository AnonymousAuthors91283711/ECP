Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1, 1, 1), (-1, -1, -1, -1)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1, 1, 1), (-1, -1, -1, -1), 
(Real.sqrt ((1 + Real.sqrt 5)/2), Real.sqrt (2/(1 + Real.sqrt 5)), Real.sqrt ((1 + Real.sqrt 5)/2), Real.sqrt (2/(1 + Real.sqrt 5))), 
(Real.sqrt ((1 + Real.sqrt 5)/2), -Real.sqrt (2/(1 + Real.sqrt 5)), Real.sqrt ((1 + Real.sqrt 5)/2), -Real.sqrt (2/(1 + Real.sqrt 5))), 
(-Real.sqrt ((1 + Real.sqrt 5)/2), Real.sqrt (2/(1 + Real.sqrt 5)), -Real.sqrt ((1 + Real.sqrt 5)/2), Real.sqrt (2/(1 + Real.sqrt 5))), 
(-Real.sqrt ((1 + Real.sqrt 5)/2), -Real.sqrt (2/(1 + Real.sqrt 5)), -Real.sqrt ((1 + Real.sqrt 5)/2), -Real.sqrt (2/(1 + Real.sqrt 5)))}
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed solution:

1. The problem describes a system of cyclic equations where each variable is related to the next in a chain, and the last loops back to the first.

2. The ground truth answer only includes the obvious symmetric solutions where all variables are equal to 1 or -1.

3. The proposed answer includes additional solutions involving √5 terms. Let's check if these satisfy the original equations:

For the first additional solution:
Let x = z = √φ where φ = (1+√5)/2 (golden ratio)
Then y = w = √(2/φ) = √(2/(1+√5))

Check first equation: x + x⁻³ = √φ + (√φ)⁻³ = √φ + φ^(-3/2)
But 2y = 2√(2/φ)

These are not equal (φ^(-3/2) ≠ 2√(2/φ) - √φ), so these additional solutions don't satisfy the original equations.
