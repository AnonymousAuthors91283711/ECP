The problem is to find the real value of x that satisfies the equation 4x - 2y + 3 = 3x + 3y when y = 1. We can solve this algebraically by substituting y=1 and solving for x. The Python program will verify this by checking the equation holds for the derived x value.

```python
# Solve 4x - 2*1 + 3 = 3x + 3*1 when y=1
# Simplifies to 4x + 1 = 3x + 3 â†’ x = 2
x = 2
y = 1
left_side = 4 * x - 2 * y + 3
right_side = 3 * x + 3 * y
print(f"For x={x}, y={y}:")
print(f"Left side: {left_side}, Right side: {right_side}")
print(f"Equation holds: {left_side == right_side}")
```
