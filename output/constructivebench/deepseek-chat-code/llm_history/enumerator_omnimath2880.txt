[write_program]
This problem is about calculating the average of three numbers x, y, z where:
- x = 3
- y = 2 * x
- z = 3 * y

The program will compute the exact value of (x + y + z)/3 by following the given relationships. Since all values are derived from x=3 through simple multiplications, we can compute the exact rational result.

```python
# Calculate the average of x, y, z where:
# x = 3, y = 2x, z = 3y
x = 3
y = 2 * x
z = 3 * y
average = (x + y + z) / 3

# Output the exact value as a fraction to avoid floating point approximation
print(f"{average}")
```
