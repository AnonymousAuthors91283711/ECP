The problem involves finding the smallest natural number n such that there exists a finite set of real numbers s where for each x in s, the function f(n, x) = 0, and the sum of all elements in s exceeds 500,000. The function f is defined recursively based on absolute differences.

We'll approach this by:
1. Understanding that f(n,x) = 0 implies x must be a fixed point of the recursive absolute difference operation
2. These fixed points form a specific pattern related to triangular numbers
3. The sum condition requires finding n where the sum of these fixed points exceeds 500,000

```python
def f(n, x):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return abs(x - 1)
    else:
        return f(n-1, abs(x - n))

def find_min_n(target_sum):
    n = 1
    while True:
        # The fixed points are the averages of all subsets of {1,2,...,n}
        # The maximal sum comes from using all numbers {1,2,...,n}
        # Sum is n*(n+1)/2
        current_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2
        if current_sum > target_sum:
            print(f"Testing n={n}: sum={current_sum}")
            return n
        n += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    target = 500000
    print(f"Searching for minimal n where sum exceeds {target}")
    result = find_min_n(target)
    print(f"Minimal n found: {result}")
```
