The problem is to find the value of (1/6)*x given that (1/3)*x = 4. This is a simple linear equation problem where we can solve for x first, then compute (1/6)*x. The Python program will demonstrate this calculation.

```python
# Given (1/3)*x = 4, we solve for x then compute (1/6)*x
x = 4 * 3  # Solving (1/3)*x = 4 gives x = 12
result = x / 6
print(result)  # Outputs 2.0
```
