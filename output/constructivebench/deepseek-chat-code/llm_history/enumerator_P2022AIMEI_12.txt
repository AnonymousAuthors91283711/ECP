[write_program]
This problem involves computing sums over power sets and finding a modular result. We'll write a Python program to compute S(n) for small values of n to identify patterns and conjectures.

The approach:
1. Implement powerset generation
2. Compute S(n) by iterating through all pairs of subsets
3. Track the GCD pattern between consecutive S(n) values
4. Compute the required modular result for small n

```python
from itertools import combinations
from math import gcd

def powerset(n):
    """Generate all subsets of range(n)"""
    for k in range(n+1):
        for subset in combinations(range(n), k):
            yield set(subset)

def S(n):
    """Compute S(n) as defined in the problem"""
    total = 0
    subsets = list(powerset(n))
    for A in subsets:
        for B in subsets:
            if len(A) == len(B):
                total += len(A & B)
    return total

def compute_result(n1, n2):
    """Compute (S(n1)/d + S(n2)/d) mod 1000 where d = gcd(S(n1), S(n2))"""
    s1 = S(n1)
    s2 = S(n2)
    d = gcd(s1, s2)
    return (s1 // d + s2 // d) % 1000

# Compute for small values to observe patterns
for n in range(1, 6):
    s = S(n)
    print(f"S({n}) = {s}")
    if n > 1:
        prev_s = S(n-1)
        d = gcd(s, prev_s)
        res = (s // d + prev_s // d) % 1000
        print(f"  Result for n={n}: {res}")
```

Note: This program computes exact values for small n (up to 5) due to combinatorial explosion. For the actual problem (n=2022), a mathematical pattern or closed-form solution would need to be derived from these observations. The output shows the computed values and intermediate results that could help identify such a pattern.
