Ground Truth Answer: 500
Proposed Answer: 5 * 4 * 5 * 5 * 5
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

Problem Breakdown:
1. We're counting 4-digit numbers (1000-9999)
2. All digits must be even (including the thousands digit)
3. The digits are checked via:
   - Even (n/1000) [thousands digit]
   - Even ((n/100)%10) [hundreds digit]
   - Even ((n/10)%10) [tens digit]
   - Even (n%10) [units digit]

Ground Truth: 500 (correct count)
Proposed Answer: 5*4*5*5*5 (which equals 2500)

Analysis:
- Thousands digit (n/1000): Can be 1-9, but must be even → 2,4,6,8 → 4 choices
- Hundreds digit: 0-9, must be even → 0,2,4,6,8 → 5 choices
- Tens digit: same as hundreds → 5 choices
- Units digit: same → 5 choices

Correct calculation should be 4*5*5*5 = 500 (matches ground truth)
The proposed answer has an extra factor of 5 at the start (5*4*5*5*5) which is incorrect.
