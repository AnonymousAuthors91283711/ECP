Verification:
- At t=1/2, all ants reach center or opposite edges
- For t'<1/2, at least one ant is strictly inside

For m=2:
Candidate t: 1
Verification:
- At t=1, all ants reach center or opposite edges
- For t'<1, at least one ant is strictly inside

For m=3:
Candidate t: 3/2
Verification:
- At t=3/2, all ants reach center or opposite edges
- For t'<3/2, at least one ant is strictly inside

For m=4:
Candidate t: 2
Verification:
- At t=2, all ants reach center or opposite edges
- For t'<2, at least one ant is strictly inside

For m=5:
Candidate t: 5/2
Verification:
- At t=5/2, all ants reach center or opposite edges
- For t'<5/2, at least one ant is strictly inside
