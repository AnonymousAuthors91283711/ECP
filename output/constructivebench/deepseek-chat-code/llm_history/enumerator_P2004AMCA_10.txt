[write_program]
This problem asks for an integer k such that the sum of 49 consecutive integers starting from k equals 7^5, and then defines the answer as the middle term (k+24). We'll write a Python program to find this k.

The sum of n consecutive integers starting from k is n*k + n(n-1)/2. For n=49, this becomes 49k + 1176. Setting this equal to 7^5=16807, we can solve for k.

```python
def find_k():
    n = 49
    target = 7**5
    # Sum formula: n*k + n*(n-1)//2 = target
    # Solve for k: k = (target - n*(n-1)//2)/n
    numerator = target - n*(n-1)//2
    if numerator % n != 0:
        print("No integer solution exists")
        return
    k = numerator // n
    print(f"k = {k}")
    middle_term = k + 24
    print(f"Middle term (k+24) = {middle_term}")

find_k()
```
