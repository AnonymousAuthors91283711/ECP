Ground Truth Answer: Real.sqrt 6 / 2
Proposed Answer: Real.sqrt (2 + Real.sqrt 3) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves trigonometric identities since we're dealing with x² + y² = 1 (unit circle) and expressions resembling triple-angle formulas.

2. The ground truth answer √6/2 ≈ 1.2247 is a known exact value.

3. The proposed answer √(2+√3)/2 ≈ √3.732/2 ≈ 1.9319/2 ≈ 0.9659, which is significantly different from the ground truth.

4. The expressions are fundamentally different in both form and numerical value.

5. The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the given conditions when tested numerically.
