[write_program]
This problem involves finding the maximum possible value of a cyclic sum under certain constraints. We'll approach it by:

1. Considering small cases (n=3,4,5) to identify patterns
2. Looking for symmetric solutions that might maximize the sum
3. Gradually increasing n to see how the maximum behaves

The program will enumerate possible configurations for small n values and compute the sum to help conjecture the general pattern.

```python
def main():
    # Test for different cycle lengths (small values first)
    for n in [3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 100]:
        print(f"\nTesting n = {n}")
        
        # Try alternating pattern (1/3, 0, 1/3, ...)
        x1 = [1/3 if i%3 == 0 else 0 for i in range(n)]
        sum1 = sum(x1[i] * x1[(i+2)%n] for i in range(n))
        print(f"Alternating pattern sum: {sum1}")
        
        # Try uniform pattern (1/3 for all)
        x2 = [1/3] * n
        sum2 = sum(x2[i] * x2[(i+2)%n] for i in range(n))
        print(f"Uniform pattern sum: {sum2}")
        
        # Try pattern with two active variables per triple
        x3 = [1/2 if i%2 == 0 else 0 for i in range(n)]
        sum3 = sum(x3[i] * x3[(i+2)%n] for i in range(n))
        print(f"Two-active pattern sum: {sum3}")
        
        # Try optimal pattern for n divisible by 3
        if n % 3 == 0:
            x4 = [1/3 if i%3 != 2 else 0 for i in range(n)]
            sum4 = sum(x4[i] * x4[(i+2)%n] for i in range(n))
            print(f"Optimal divisible-by-3 pattern sum: {sum4}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
