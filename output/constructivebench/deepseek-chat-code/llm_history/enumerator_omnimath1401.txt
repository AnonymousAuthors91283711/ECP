This problem is about counting the number of maximum independent sets in a grid graph of size 10Ã—2 (10 rows, 2 columns). An independent set is a set of vertices where no two vertices are adjacent. The maximum size of such a set is 9, and we need to count how many such sets exist.

We'll approach this by:
1. Modeling the grid graph structure
2. Enumerating all possible independent sets of size 9
3. Counting the valid configurations

The key observation is that in each column, we can choose at most 5 vertices (every other one), but to reach size 9, we need to take 5 from one column and 4 from the other, with specific constraints on their positions.

```python
def count_max_independent_sets():
    count = 0
    # We'll represent the grid as two columns (0 and 1), each with 10 rows (0-9)
    # An independent set can have at most 5 in one column (every other vertex)
    # and 4 in the other column, with specific constraints
    
    # Case 1: 5 in column 0 and 4 in column 1
    for mask0 in range(1 << 10):
        # Check if column 0 has 5 non-adjacent vertices (no two consecutive)
        bits0 = bin(mask0).count('1')
        if bits0 != 5:
            continue
        # Check no two consecutive bits are set
        valid = True
        for i in range(9):
            if (mask0 & (1 << i)) and (mask0 & (1 << (i+1))):
                valid = False
                break
        if not valid:
            continue
        
        # For each valid column 0, count compatible column 1 configurations
        # Column 1 must have 4 vertices, none adjacent to column 0's vertices
        forbidden = mask0 | (mask0 << 1) | (mask0 >> 1)
        forbidden &= 0x3FF  # Keep only 10 bits
        
        # Now count subsets of size 4 in column 1 that don't use forbidden rows
        available = (~forbidden) & 0x3FF
        bits_available = bin(available).count('1')
        if bits_available >= 4:
            count += comb(bits_available, 4)
    
    # Case 2: 5 in column 1 and 4 in column 0 (symmetric to above)
    # The count will be the same due to symmetry
    count *= 2
    
    print(count)
