Final result: 955. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern in the partial sums and the problem's nature of summing rounded square roots, the final answer modulo 1000 appears to be:

<<<955>>> 

The pattern shows the sum grows quadratically but with periodic adjustments due to rounding behavior. The exact value 955 matches the final requirement of the sum modulo 1000.
