This problem involves finding the value of (x-z)/(y-z) given that (x-y)/(z-y) = -10. We can approach this by solving the equation symbolically and verifying with sample values.

The solution approach:
1. From (x-y)/(z-y) = -10, we get x-y = -10(z-y)
2. Expand to x - y = -10z + 10y → x = -10z + 11y
3. Substitute x into (x-z)/(y-z) → (-10z+11y - z)/(y-z) = (-11z + 11y)/(y-z) = 11(y-z)/(y-z) = 11 when y ≠ z

The Python program will verify this with sample values:

```python
def verify_ratio(y, z):
    # Given (x-y)/(z-y) = -10, compute x
    x = -10 * (z - y) + y
    # Compute (x-z)/(y-z)
    ratio = (x - z) / (y - z)
    print(f"For y={y}, z={z}: ratio = {ratio}")
    return ratio

# Test with various sample values
samples = [
    (1, 2),
    (3, 5),
    (0, 1),
    (-1, 1),
    (10, 20)
]

for y, z in samples:
    if y != z:  # Avoid division by zero
        verify_ratio(y, z)
    else:
        print(f"Skipping y=z={y} (would cause division by zero)")

# The output consistently shows ratio=11.0 for all valid cases
```
