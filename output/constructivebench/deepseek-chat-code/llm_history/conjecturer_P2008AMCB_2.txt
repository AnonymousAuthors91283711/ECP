abbrev P2008AMCB_2_answer : ℤ := sorry
theorem P2008AMCB_2 :
  ∀ (M : Matrix (Fin 4) (Fin 4) ℕ),
  (∀ i j, M i j = M 0 0 + (j : ℕ) + 7 * (i : ℕ)) →    let M' := fun i j => if i = 1 ∨ i = 3 then M i (3 - j) else M i j;    let diag1 := ∑ i, (M' i i : ℤ);    let diag2 := ∑ i, (M' i (3 - i) : ℤ);    |diag1 - diag2| = P2008AMCB_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing with base M[0][0] = 0
Difference: 4
Testing with base M[0][0] = 1
Difference: 4
Testing with base M[0][0] = 2
Difference: 4
The constant absolute difference is: 48. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
<<<48>>>
