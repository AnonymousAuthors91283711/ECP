abbrev P2006AMCA_2_answer : ℤ → ℤ := sorry
theorem P2006AMCA_2 (h : ℤ) :
    let tensor (x y : ℤ) := x^3 - y
    tensor h (tensor h h) = P2006AMCA_2_answer h := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun h => h
Proposed Answer: fun h : ℤ => h
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a function `tensor(x,y) = x³ - y` and asks to simplify `tensor h (tensor h h)`
2. Let's compute this step by step:
   - Inner `tensor h h` = h³ - h
   - Outer `tensor h (h³ - h)` = h³ - (h³ - h) = h³ - h³ + h = h
3. The ground truth answer correctly simplifies this to the identity function `fun h => h`
4. The proposed answer is identical in form and meaning: `fun h : ℤ => h`

The only difference is that the proposed answer explicitly specifies the type `ℤ`, which is already implied by the context and doesn't change the mathematical meaning.
