[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive constant C such that for any 5 positive real numbers, there exist four distinct indices where the absolute difference of two ratios is â‰¤ C. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible C values by testing small rational cases.

The approach:
1. Generate all possible 5-tuples of small positive integers (representing ratios)
2. For each tuple, compute all possible |a_i/a_j - a_k/a_l| for distinct i,j,k,l
3. Track the maximum such difference for each tuple
4. Find the minimal C that covers all cases

```python
from itertools import combinations, product
from fractions import Fraction

def find_min_C(max_num=5):
    # We'll test all 5-tuples of positive integers up to max_num
    min_C = None
    worst_case = None
    
    # Generate all possible 5-tuples
    for nums in product(range(1, max_num+1), repeat=5):
        current_max = Fraction(0, 1)
        # Generate all combinations of 4 distinct indices
        for quad in combinations(range(5), 4):
            i, j, k, l = quad
            # Compute |a_i/a_j - a_k/a_l|
            val1 = Fraction(nums[i], nums[j])
            val2 = Fraction(nums[k], nums[l])
            diff = abs(val1 - val2)
            if diff > current_max:
                current_max = diff
        
        # Update global min_C if needed
        if min_C is None or current_max < min_C:
            min_C = current_max
            worst_case = nums
            print(f"New candidate C: {float(min_C)} from tuple {nums}")
    
    print(f"Final minimal C found: {float(min_C)} (exact {min_C})")

# Run with small numbers first
find_min_C(5)
```
