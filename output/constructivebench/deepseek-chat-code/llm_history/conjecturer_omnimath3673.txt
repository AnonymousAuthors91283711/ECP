theorem omnimath3673 (p q : ℕ) :
  p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ p < 2005 ∧ q < 2005 ∧ q ∣ (p^2 + 4) ∧ p ∣ (q^2 + 4) ↔ (p, q) ∈ omnimath3673_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for prime pairs (p, q) with p < q < 2005 where:
q divides p²+4 and p divides q²+4
Found pair: (5, 29). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
<<<{(2, 2), (2, 5), (5, 2), (5, 29), (29, 5), (29, 433), (433, 29)}>>>
