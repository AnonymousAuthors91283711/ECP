theorem omnimath1317 (x : ℝ) (hx1 : x ≠ -2) (hx2 : x ≠ -9/2) :
  (x + 1)/(x + 2) > (3*x + 4)/(2*x + 9) ↔ x ∈ omnimath1317_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: Icc (-9/2) (-2) ∪ Ioo ((1 - sqrt 5)/2) ((1 + sqrt 5)/2)
Proposed Answer: Iio (-9/2) ∪ Ioo (-2) (-1/2) ∪ Ioi 1
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

The problem is solving the inequality (x+1)/(x+2) > (3x+4)/(2x+9) with constraints x ≠ -2 and x ≠ -9/2.

Key observations:
1. The ground truth answer involves three intervals:
   - From -9/2 to -2 (closed intervals)
   - From (1-√5)/2 to (1+√5)/2 (open intervals)

2. The proposed answer involves:
   - Everything below -9/2
   - From -2 to -1/2
   - Everything above 1

Comparing them:
- The ground truth's Icc (-9/2) (-2) is completely missing from the proposed answer
- The proposed answer's Iio (-9/2) is incorrect as the ground truth shows values below -9/2 don't satisfy the inequality
- The proposed answer's Ioo (-2) (-1/2) partially overlaps with the ground truth's solution near (1-√5)/2 ≈ -0.618, but is incomplete
- The proposed answer's Ioi 1 partially matches the ground truth's upper bound (1+√5)/2 ≈ 1.618, but extends too far

The proposed answer is incorrect in most parts and doesn't match the ground truth.
