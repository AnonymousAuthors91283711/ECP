[write_program]
The problem asks to find the value of q + r given that p, q, r, s are consecutive integers (q = p+1, r = q+1, s = r+1) and p + s = 109. We can solve this algebraically, but for demonstration purposes, we'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values.

The algebraic solution would be:
1. Let p = x, then q = x+1, r = x+2, s = x+3
2. p + s = x + (x+3) = 2x + 3 = 109 â‡’ x = 53
3. Therefore q + r = (x+1) + (x+2) = 2x + 3 = 109

But we'll write a program to verify this by checking possible values around a reasonable range.

```python
def find_q_plus_r():
    # Since p and s are 3 apart (p, p+1, p+2, p+3), and p + s = 109
    # We can limit our search to p values where p + (p+3) = 109 => p = 53
    # But for demonstration, we'll search a small range around this
    for p in range(50, 56):
        q = p + 1
        r = q + 1
        s = r + 1
        if p + s == 109:
            print(f"Found solution: p={p}, q={q}, r={r}, s={s}")
            print(f"q + r = {q + r}")
            return  # Exit after finding the first solution since it's unique
    
    print("No solution found in the search range")

find_q_plus_r()
```
