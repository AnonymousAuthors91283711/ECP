[write_program]
The problem asks for the number of subsets of natural numbers (as a Finset) where all elements are non-prime numbers less than 23, and their sum equals 23. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such subsets.

Approach:
1. First generate all non-prime numbers < 23
2. Use dynamic programming to find all subsets that sum to 23
3. Count all valid subsets

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_subsets():
    # Generate non-prime numbers < 23
    numbers = [n for n in range(1, 23) if not is_prime(n)]
    print(f"Non-prime numbers < 23: {numbers}")
    
    # DP approach to find subsets that sum to 23
    dp = [set() for _ in range(24)]
    dp[0].add(frozenset())
    
    for num in numbers:
        for s in range(23, num - 1, -1):
            for subset in dp[s - num]:
                new_subset = set(subset)
                new_subset.add(num)
                dp[s].add(frozenset(new_subset))
    
    # Get all unique subsets that sum to 23
    result_subsets = [set(subset) for subset in dp[23]]
    
    # Print each subset found
    for subset in sorted(result_subsets, key=lambda x: (len(x), sorted(x))):
        print(f"Found subset: {sorted(subset)} (sum = {sum(subset)})")
    
    # Print the total count
    print(f"Total number of subsets: {len(result_subsets)}")

find_subsets()
```
