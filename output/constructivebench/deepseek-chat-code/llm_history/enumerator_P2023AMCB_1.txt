The problem involves calculating a rational number through a series of arithmetic operations. We need to compute the value of `P2023AMCB_1_answer` which is defined as `transfer / 3`, where `transfer` is derived from other intermediate calculations. The exact steps are:

1. Compute `total = 3 + (1/3)`
2. Compute `target = total / 4`
3. Compute `transfer = target - (1/3)`
4. Final answer is `transfer / 3`

We'll implement this calculation in Python using exact rational arithmetic (via fractions.Fraction) to avoid floating-point inaccuracies.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve():
    # Step 1: Compute total = 3 + (1/3)
    total = Fraction(3) + Fraction(1, 3)
    
    # Step 2: Compute target = total / 4
    target = total / Fraction(4)
    
    # Step 3: Compute transfer = target - (1/3)
    transfer = target - Fraction(1, 3)
    
    # Step 4: Final answer is transfer / 3
    answer = transfer / Fraction(3)
    
    # Print the exact rational answer
    print(f"Answer: {answer.numerator}/{answer.denominator}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```
