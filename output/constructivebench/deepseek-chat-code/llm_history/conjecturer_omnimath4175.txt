: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x y : ℝ, f (x * y) * (f x - f y) = (x - y) * f x * f y} = omnimath4175_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing constant functions:
Found solution: f(x) = 0

Testing linear functions:
Found solution: f(x) = 0x
Found solution: f(x) = 1x
Found solution: f(x) = -1x
Found solution: f(x) = 2x
Found solution: f(x) = -2x

Testing rational function f(x) = 1/x:

Special case: zero function
Found solution: f(x) = 0. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
From the enumerated answers, we observe that the solutions include:
1. The zero function (f(x) = 0)
2. Linear functions (f(x) = kx)
3. The reciprocal function (f(x) = 1/x)

The pattern suggests the general solution is either the zero function or functions of the form f(x) = kx or f(x) = 1/x. However, testing shows only the zero function and linear functions satisfy the equation consistently.
