This problem involves calculating the probability of getting a face value of 2 after two dependent dice rolls. The first roll uses initial faces [1,2,3,4,6,8]. The second roll's faces are updated based on the first roll's outcome: if odd, odd faces are doubled; if even, even faces are halved. We need to find the probability that the second roll results in a 2.

Here's a Python program to enumerate all possible outcomes and calculate the probability:

```python
def main():
    initial_faces = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8]
    
    def update_faces(x):
        if x % 2 == 1:  # if first roll is odd
            return [y * 2 if y % 2 == 1 else y for y in initial_faces]
        else:  # if first roll is even
            return [y // 2 if y % 2 == 0 else y for y in initial_faces]
    
    total_outcomes = len(initial_faces) * len(initial_faces)  # since second roll has same number of faces
    favorable = 0
    
    for first in initial_faces:
        second_faces = update_faces(first)
        count_2 = second_faces.count(2)
        print(f"First roll: {first}, Second faces: {second_faces}, Count of 2: {count_2}")
        favorable += count_2
    
    probability = favorable / total_outcomes
    print(f"\nProbability: {favorable}/{total_outcomes} = {probability}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program:
1. Defines the initial faces
2. Implements the update rule for second roll faces
3. Enumerates all first rolls and shows the resulting second faces
4. Counts occurrences of 2 in second rolls
5. Calculates and prints the final probability

Note: The original Lean problem had `totalOutcomes` calculated as `firstRoll.length * (secondRoll 1).length`, but since all second rolls have the same number of faces (6), we simplify to `len(initial_faces)^2`. The program prints intermediate results to help verify the calculation.
