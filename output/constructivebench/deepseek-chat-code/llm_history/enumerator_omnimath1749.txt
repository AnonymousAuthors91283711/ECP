This problem involves computing the 24th iterate of the function f(x) = x² - 2 applied to 18, modulo 89. The challenge is to efficiently compute this nested function application without doing all 24 steps naively, since the numbers would become extremely large. Instead, we can work modulo 89 throughout the computation since (a mod m)² mod m = a² mod m.

Here's a Python program that computes this iteratively while keeping numbers small by taking modulo 89 at each step:

```python
def compute_iterated():
    f = lambda x: (x * x - 2) % 89
    current = 18
    for i in range(24):
        current = f(current)
        print(f"After {i+1} iterations: {current}")  # Show progress
    return current

result = compute_iterated()
print(f"Final result after 24 iterations: {result}")
```

The program:
1. Defines the function f(x) = x² - 2 mod 89
2. Starts with initial value 18
3. Applies f 24 times, printing intermediate results
4. Finally prints the result after all iterations

This approach is efficient because we never deal with numbers larger than 89² = 7921, and typically much smaller due to the modulo operation. The intermediate print statements help verify the computation is proceeding correctly.

Note that we don't need to optimize further (e.g., using cycle detection) because 24 iterations is manageable, and the modulo operation keeps numbers small. The program will output the final value which is the answer to the problem.
