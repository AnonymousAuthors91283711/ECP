[write_program]
This problem involves solving a logarithmic equation for y in terms of x. We'll write a Python program to explore possible solutions by testing small positive integer values for x and y, then look for patterns.

The equation is: log₂x - 2log₂y = 2
We can rewrite this as: log₂(x/y²) = 2 ⇒ x/y² = 2² ⇒ y² = x/4 ⇒ y = √(x/4)

The program will:
1. Test small integer values of x from 1 to 20
2. For each x, test integer y values from 1 to 20
3. Check if they satisfy the equation (with some floating point tolerance)
4. Print valid (x,y) pairs and the computed y = √(x/4) value

```python
import math

def log2(x):
    return math.log(x, 2)

# Test small positive integers for x and y
for x in range(1, 21):
    for y in range(1, 21):
        lhs = log2(x) - 2 * log2(y)
        if abs(lhs - 2) < 1e-6:  # Floating point tolerance
            computed_y = math.sqrt(x / 4)
            print(f"x={x}, y={y}, computed y={computed_y}")
```
