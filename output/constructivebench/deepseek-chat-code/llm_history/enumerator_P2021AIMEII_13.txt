[write_program]
The problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that 1000 divides (2^n + 5^n - n). We'll write a Python program to find this minimal n by checking values sequentially until we find the first one satisfying the condition.

```python
def find_min_n():
    n = 1
    while True:
        if (pow(2, n, 1000) + pow(5, n, 1000) - n) % 1000 == 0:
            print(f"Found candidate: {n}")
            return n  # Return immediately when first solution found
        n += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    min_n = find_min_n()
    print(f"Minimal n is: {min_n}")
```
