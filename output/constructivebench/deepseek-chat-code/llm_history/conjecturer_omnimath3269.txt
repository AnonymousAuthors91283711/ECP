From the enumerated solutions, we can observe two main patterns:
1. Constant p with linear q: p = ±1, q = ±(x + c)
2. Linear p with constant q: p = ±(x + c), q = ±1

The general solution appears to be all pairs where one polynomial is constant and the other is linear, with matching signs. Here's the Lean expression:

<<<{ (p, q) | (∃ c : ℝ, p = C 1 ∧ q = X + C c) ∨ (∃ c : ℝ, p = C (-1) ∧ q = -X + C c) ∨ (∃ c : ℝ, p = X + C c ∧ q = C 1) ∨ (∃ c : ℝ, p = -X + C c ∧ q = C (-1))) }>>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

From the enumerated answers and the problem statement, we can see that the solution pairs (p, q) fall into two main patterns:
1. Constant p with linear q (either p = 1 and q = x + c, or p = -1 and q = -x + c)
2. Linear p with constant q (either p = x + c and q = 1, or p = -x + c and q = -1)

The error in the original proposed answer was due to mismatched parentheses. Here's the corrected version:

<<<{ (p, q) | (∃ c : ℝ, p = C 1 ∧ q = X + C c) ∨ (∃ c : ℝ, p = C (-1) ∧ q = -X + C c) ∨ (∃ c : ℝ, p = X + C c ∧ q = C 1) ∨ (∃ c : ℝ, p = -X + C c ∧ q = C (-1)) }>>>

The solution captures all four cases seen in the enumerated answers:
1. p = 1, q = x + c
2. p = -1, q = -x + c
3. p = x + c, q = 1
4. p = -x + c, q = -1

The enumerated answers show exactly these patterns, with various values of c (the constant term). The key insight is that the functional equation p(x)q(x+1) - p(x+1)q(x) = 1 can only be satisfied when one polynomial is constant and the other is linear, with specific coefficient relationships.
