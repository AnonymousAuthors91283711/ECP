[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that there exists a positive integer v satisfying:
1. The sum from k=0 to n-1 of (v-k)/60 equals 2/3
2. v - (n-1) > 0 (all terms positive)
3. v - (n-1) < v (strictly decreasing sequence)

We'll write a Python program to find the minimal n by:
1. Solving the sum equation which simplifies to n*(2v - n + 1)/120 = 2/3
2. Checking the conditions for each n starting from 1 upwards

```python
def find_min_n():
    for n in range(1, 100):  # Reasonable upper bound
        # From the sum equation: n*(2v - n + 1) = 80
        # So 2v = (80 + n^2 - n)/n
        numerator = 80 + n*n - n
        if numerator % n != 0:
            continue
        two_v = numerator // n
        if two_v % 2 != 0:
            continue
        v = two_v // 2
        
        # Check conditions
        if v <= 0:
            continue
        last_term = v - (n - 1)
        if last_term <= 0:
            continue
        if last_term >= v:
            continue
        
        print(f"Found valid solution: n={n}, v={v}")
        return n  # Since we're checking in order, first is minimal
    
    print("No solution found in range")
    return None

find_min_n()
```
