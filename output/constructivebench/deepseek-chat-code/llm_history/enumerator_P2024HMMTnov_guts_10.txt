[write_program]
The problem asks for the largest prime factor of the number \(3^{12} + 3^9 + 3^5 + 1\). We'll write a Python program to compute this number, factorize it, and find its largest prime factor.

Approach:
1. Compute the value of \(3^{12} + 3^9 + 3^5 + 1\)
2. Factorize this number
3. Identify the largest prime factor

We'll use sympy for efficient factorization of large numbers.

```python
import sympy

def compute_expression():
    # Compute 3^12 + 3^9 + 3^5 + 1
    n = 3**12 + 3**9 + 3**5 + 1
    return n

def find_largest_prime_factor(n):
    # Get prime factors
    factors = sympy.factorint(n)
    prime_factors = list(factors.keys())
    # Print all prime factors
    print("Prime factors:", sorted(prime_factors))
    # Return the largest one
    return max(prime_factors)

def main():
    n = compute_expression()
    print(f"Value of 3^12 + 3^9 + 3^5 + 1: {n}")
    largest_prime = find_largest_prime_factor(n)
    print(f"Largest prime factor: {largest_prime}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
