This problem asks for the count of numbers between 1 and 2008 where applying the Collatz function three consecutive times results in values strictly greater than the original number each time. The Collatz function is defined as: if even, divide by 2; if odd, multiply by 3 and add 1.

We'll write a Python program to count these numbers by:
1. Implementing the Collatz step function
2. Checking the condition for each number from 1 to 2008
3. Counting numbers that satisfy all three steps being greater than original

```python
def collatz_step(n):
    return n // 2 if n % 2 == 0 else 3 * n + 1

count = 0
for a in range(1, 2009):
    step1 = collatz_step(a)
    if step1 <= a:
        continue
    step2 = collatz_step(step1)
    if step2 <= a:
        continue
    step3 = collatz_step(step2)
    if step3 > a:
        count += 1
        print(f"Found: {a}")  # Stream partial results

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
