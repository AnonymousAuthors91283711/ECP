[write_program]
This problem involves finding the largest natural number `n` such that there exists a set `V` of size `n` and a 3-coloring of edges (represented by `E : V → V → Fin 3`) satisfying two conditions:
1. No vertex has edges of all three colors to other vertices
2. No monochromatic triangle (for any three distinct vertices, their edges are not all the same color)

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of `n` and check these conditions for small cases.

```python
from itertools import combinations, product

def check_conditions(n):
    # Generate all possible 3-colorings of edges for n vertices
    # This is computationally intensive, so we'll limit n to small values
    vertices = range(n)
    # Each edge coloring is represented as a tuple (u,v) -> color (0,1,2)
    # We'll iterate through all possible colorings (3^(n(n-1)/2) possibilities)
    
    # For small n, we can brute-force
    if n > 4:  # Too many combinations for n>4
        return False
    
    edge_indices = [(u,v) for u in vertices for v in vertices if u < v]
    num_edges = len(edge_indices)
    
    # Iterate through all possible colorings (as base-3 numbers)
    for coloring_num in range(3**num_edges):
        # Create the edge coloring
        coloring = {}
        temp = coloring_num
        for u,v in edge_indices:
            coloring[(u,v)] = temp % 3
            temp = temp // 3
        
        # Check condition 1: no vertex has all three colors
        condition1_ok = True
        for v in vertices:
            colors = set()
            for u in vertices:
                if u == v:
                    continue
                a, b = (u,v) if u < v else (v,u)
                colors.add(coloring[(a,b)])
                if len(colors) == 3:
                    condition1_ok = False
                    break
            if not condition1_ok:
                break
        if not condition1_ok:
            continue
        
        # Check condition 2: no monochromatic triangle
        condition2_ok = True
        for u,v,w in combinations(vertices, 3):
            uv = coloring[(u,v)] if u < v else coloring[(v,u)]
            vw = coloring[(v,w)] if v < w else coloring[(w,v)]
            uw = coloring[(u,w)] if u < w else coloring[(w,u)]
            if uv == vw == uw:
                condition2_ok = False
                break
        if condition2_ok:
            return True
    return False

# Enumerate possible n values
max_n = 0
for n in range(1, 6):  # Check up to n=5
    if check_conditions(n):
        print(f"Found valid configuration for n = {n}")
        max_n = n
print(f"Maximum n found: {max_n}")
