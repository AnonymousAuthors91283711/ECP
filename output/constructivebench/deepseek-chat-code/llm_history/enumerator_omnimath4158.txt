[write_program]
This problem appears to be about finding finite projective planes of order n (where each line contains 3 points). The conditions specify that:
1. Each line contains exactly 3 points
2. Any two distinct lines intersect at exactly one point
3. Any two distinct points lie on exactly one common line
4. There is at least one line

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of n (number of points) that satisfy these conditions for small cases. The smallest non-trivial case is the Fano plane with n=7.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_projective_plane(n, lines):
    points = set().union(*lines)
    if len(points) != n:
        return False
    
    # Check each line has exactly 3 points
    if any(len(line) != 3 for line in lines):
        return False
    
    # Check any two lines intersect at exactly one point
    for l1, l2 in combinations(lines, 2):
        if len(l1 & l2) != 1:
            return False
    
    # Check any two points lie on exactly one common line
    for p1, p2 in combinations(points, 2):
        common_lines = [line for line in lines if p1 in line and p2 in line]
        if len(common_lines) != 1:
            return False
    
    return bool(lines)  # Non-empty

def enumerate_possible_n(max_n=15):
    for n in range(3, max_n + 1):
        # Generate all possible sets of 3-element lines
        points = set(range(n))
        all_triples = [frozenset(c) for c in combinations(points, 3)]
        
        # Try all possible line sets of increasing size
        found = False
        for k in range(1, len(all_triples) + 1):
            for lines in combinations(all_triples, k):
                if is_projective_plane(n, set(lines)):
                    print(f"Found configuration for n = {n}")
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Searching for projective planes with 3 points per line...")
    enumerate_possible_n()
```
