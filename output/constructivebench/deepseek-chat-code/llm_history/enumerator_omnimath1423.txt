This problem involves summing k multiplied by the difference in floor divisions of 2009/k and 2008/k for k from 1 to 2009. The key observation is that floor(2009/k) - floor(2008/k) equals 1 when k divides 2009, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the sum simplifies to the sum of all divisors of 2009.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Factorize 2009 (7² × 41)
2. Generate all divisors from the prime factorization
3. Sum them up

```python
def get_divisors_from_factors(factors):
    divisors = [1]
    for p, exp in factors.items():
        temp = []
        for d in divisors:
            for e in range(exp + 1):
                temp.append(d * (p ** e))
        divisors = list(set(temp)))
    return sorted(divisors)

def sum_of_divisors(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    factors = {}
    # Factorize 2009
    temp = n
    for p in [7, 41]:  # We know 2009 = 7^2 * 41
        while temp % p == 0:
            factors[p] = factors.get(p, 0) + 1
            temp = temp // p
    if temp != 1:
        factors[temp] = 1
    
    divisors = get_divisors_from_factors(factors)
    return sum(divisors)

n = 2009
print(f"Sum of divisors of {n}: {sum_of_divisors(n)}")
```

Judgement Explanation:
1. The problem asks for a sum involving floor functions, but the provided program calculates the sum of divisors of 2009 instead. This is completely unrelated to the mathematical problem stated.
2. The program doesn't attempt to solve the given summation problem at all.
3. The output format doesn't match the problem requirements - it should be enumerating values related to the floor function summation, not just printing a single sum of divisors.
4. The program contains syntax errors (extra parenthesis in the divisors function).

Since the program doesn't address the actual problem and contains errors, it must be rejected.

<<<False>>>

Here's a corrected program that actually solves the given problem:

```python
def calculate_sum():
    total = 0
    for k in range(1, 2010):
        term1 = 2009 // k
        term2 = 2008 // k
        total += k * (term1 - term2)
    return total

n = 2009
print(f"Calculating sum for n={n}:")
result = calculate_sum()
print(f"Final sum: {result}")
```

The corrected program:
1. Actually computes the required summation involving floor functions
2. Uses the correct range (1 to 2009)
3. Computes each term exactly as specified in the problem
4. Outputs the final result in a clear format
5. Is efficient with O(n) complexity
6. Contains no syntax errors
