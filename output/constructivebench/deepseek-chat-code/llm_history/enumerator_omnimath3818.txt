This problem involves finding the value of f(1982) given certain conditions on a function f: ℕ → ℤ. The conditions suggest f is nearly additive but allows for a small deviation (+1) in the additive property. We'll enumerate possible functions that satisfy the given conditions and compute f(1982).

Key observations:
1. f(1) is a free parameter that determines other values
2. The function is nearly additive with possible +1 deviation
3. We have specific values at f(2)=0, f(3)>0, f(9999)=3333

We'll try small values of f(1) and see which ones satisfy all conditions, particularly f(9999)=3333.

```python
def check_f(a):
    """Check if f(1)=a satisfies all conditions, return f(1982) if valid"""
    f = {1: a}
    # Build f(n) for n up to 9999
    for n in range(2, 10000):
        # Try both possibilities for f(n)
        candidates = []
        for m in range(1, n):
            # Case 1: f(n) = f(m) + f(n-m)
            val1 = f[m] + f[n-m]
            # Case 2: f(n) = f(m) + f(n-m) + 1
            val2 = f[m] + f[n-m] + 1
            candidates.extend([val1, val2])
        
        # f(n) must be consistent with all possible decompositions
        # Find minimal value that appears in all possible decompositions
        from collections import defaultdict
        counts = defaultdict(int)
        for v in candidates:
            counts[v] += 1
        
        # Check if there's a value that appears in all (n-1)*2 possibilities
        max_possible = 2*(n-1)
        possible_vals = [v for v, cnt in counts.items() if cnt == max_possible]
        
        if not possible_vals:
            return None  # No valid f(n)
        
        # Special cases
        if n == 2:
            if 0 not in possible_vals:
                return None
            f[n] = 0
        elif n == 3:
            if not any(v > 0 for v in possible_vals):
                return None
            f[n] = min(v for v in possible_vals if v > 0)
        else:
            f[n] = min(possible_vals)
    
    # Final check
    if f[9999] == 3333:
        return f.get(1982, None)
    return None

# Try possible f(1) values (we expect it to be 0 or 1 based on f(2)=0)
for a in [0, 1]:
    result = check_f(a)
    if result is not None:
        print(f"f(1) = {a} gives f(1982) = {result}")
