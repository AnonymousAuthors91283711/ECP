abbrev omnimath1559_answer : Set ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath1559 :
  {c : ℤ | ∃ a b : ℤ, a + b * c = 2017 ∧ b + c * a = 8} = omnimath1559_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found solution: c = -6 (a = -59, b = -346)
Found solution: c = 0 (a = 2017, b = 8)
Found solution: c = 2 (a = -667, b = 1342)
Found solution: c = 8 (a = -31, b = 256)
All solutions found: [-6, 0, 2, 8]. Expected Answer Type: Set ℤ
<<<{-6, 0, 2, 8}>>>
