This problem is about finding all subsets of natural numbers that satisfy two conditions:
1. Closed under addition (if x and y are in s, then x+y is in s)
2. If neither x nor y are in s, then x+y must be in s

We'll enumerate all possible subsets up to a certain threshold to find patterns. The solution likely involves arithmetic progressions or similar structures.

```python
def is_valid_subset(s, max_n):
    """Check if subset s (up to max_n) satisfies both conditions."""
    for x in range(1, max_n+1):
        for y in range(1, max_n+1):
            # Condition 1: if both in s, sum must be in s
            if x in s and y in s and (x+y) not in s and (x+y) <= max_n:
                return False
            # Condition 2: if both not in s, sum must be in s
            if x not in s and y not in s and (x+y) in s and (x+y) <= max_n:
                return False
    return True

def enumerate_subsets(max_n):
    """Enumerate all subsets of {1,...,max_n} satisfying the conditions."""
    from itertools import product
    
    # Generate all possible subsets (represented as binary strings)
    for bits in product([0,1], repeat=max_n):
        s = {i+1 for i, b in enumerate(bits) if b == 1}
        if is_valid_subset(s, max_n):
            print(sorted(s))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Checking subsets up to n=8:")
    enumerate_subsets(8)
```
