[write_program]
This problem is about finding the smallest number M such that any collection of M boolean functions on N variables (where N ≥ 4) must contain a subset of N functions that agree on at least one output bit (either all 0 or all 1) for some input position.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible M values for small N (starting with N=4) and check the conditions. The program will test increasing M values until it finds the minimal one satisfying the condition.

```python
from itertools import combinations, product

def check_condition(N, M):
    # Generate all possible boolean functions on N variables (truth tables)
    all_funcs = list(product([False, True], repeat=N))
    
    # Check all subsets of size M
    for flags in combinations(all_funcs, M):
        found = False
        # Check all possible subsets of size N within flags
        for s in combinations(flags, N):
            # Check for each position if all functions agree on some bit
            for i in range(N):
                all_true = all(f[i] for f in s)
                all_false = all(not f[i] for f in s)
                if all_true or all_false:
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if not found:
            return False
    return True

def find_min_M(N):
    M = N  # Start checking from N upwards
    while True:
        print(f"Checking N={N}, M={M}...")
        if check_condition(N, M):
            print(f"For N={N}, minimal M is {M}")
            return M
        M += 1

# Test for small values of N
for N in range(4, 6):
    find_min_M(N)
```

Note: This program is computationally intensive for even small N because the number of boolean functions grows exponentially (2^N). For N=4, there are 16 possible functions, and we're checking combinations of them. The program will eventually find the minimal M for each N, but may take significant time for N ≥ 5. The output will show the progression of checks and finally the minimal M for each tested N.
