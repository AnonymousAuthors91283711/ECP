[write_program]
This problem involves counting Hamiltonian cycles in a 5-dimensional hypercube where each step changes exactly 2 bits. We'll write a Python program to enumerate such paths for smaller dimensions first to identify a pattern.

The program will:
1. Represent hypercube vertices as binary strings
2. Count paths that start and end at all zeros
3. Ensure each step changes exactly 2 bits
4. Print counts for dimensions 1-4 to help conjecture the answer for dimension 5

```python
from itertools import product, combinations

def count_hypercube_paths(dim):
    vertices = list(product([0,1], repeat=dim))
    zero = tuple([0]*dim)
    
    # Build adjacency list (edges with exactly 2 bit changes)
    adj = {v: [] for v in vertices}
    for v in vertices:
        for indices in combinations(range(dim), 2):
            w = list(v)
            w[indices[0]] ^= 1
            w[indices[1]] ^= 1
            adj[v].append(tuple(w))
    
    # DFS to count Hamiltonian paths from zero back to zero
    count = 0
    visited = set()
    
    def dfs(current, steps):
        nonlocal count
        if steps == 2**dim:
            if current == zero:
                count += 1
            return
        for neighbor in adj[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                dfs(neighbor, steps+1)
                visited.remove(neighbor)
    
    visited.add(zero)
    dfs(zero, 1)
    return count

# Enumerate for dimensions 1-4 (5 would be too slow with this approach)
for dim in range(1, 5):
    print(f"Dimension {dim}: {count_hypercube_paths(dim)} paths")
```
