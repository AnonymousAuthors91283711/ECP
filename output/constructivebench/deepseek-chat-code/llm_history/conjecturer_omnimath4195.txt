theorem omnimath4195 (n : ℕ) (hn : n > 0) :
  IsLeast {a : ℝ | ∀ x : ℝ, (x^(2 * 2^n) + 1)/2 ≤ (a * (x - 1)^2 + x)^(2^n)} (omnimath4195_answer n) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 1: minimal a = 1 (exact), ~1.000000
n = 2: minimal a = 6 (exact), ~6.000000
n = 3: minimal a = 112 (exact), ~112.000000
n = 4: minimal a = 30720 (exact), ~30720.000000. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℝ
Looking at the pattern from n=1 to n=4:
1 = 2^0 * 1
6 = 2^1 * 3
112 = 2^3 * 7 * 2
30720 = 2^7 * 15 * 16 * 10
This suggests a pattern involving powers of 2 and terms like (2^(2^n-1) - 1). The minimal a appears to be (2^(2^n - 1)) * (2^(2^(n-1)) - 1).
