[write_program]
The problem asks for the sum of squares of the counts of prime factors less than 6 for all numbers from 0 to 2020. The primes less than 6 are 2, 3, and 5. We'll write a Python program to compute this sum efficiently by:

1. Precomputing prime factors for numbers up to 2020
2. For each number, count how many times 2, 3, or 5 appear in its prime factorization
3. Square this count and add to the running total

```python
def compute_sum():
    max_n = 2020
    # Precompute prime factors for each number up to max_n
    prime_factors = [[] for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    for p in [2, 3, 5]:  # primes < 6
        for multiple in range(p, max_n + 1, p):
            count = 0
            n = multiple
            while n % p == 0:
                count += 1
                n //= p
            prime_factors[multiple].extend([p] * count)
    
    total = 0
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        count = len([p for p in prime_factors[n] if p < 6])
        total += count * count
    
    print(total)

compute_sum()
```
