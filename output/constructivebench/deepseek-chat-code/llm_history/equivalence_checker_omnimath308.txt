Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n + 1) / 2
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 2 * ((n + 1) / 2)
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is asking for the greatest cardinality of a subset S of [-n, n] where no three elements sum to zero. The ground truth answer gives ⌊(n+1)/2⌋, which is correct because:
1. The largest such set would be either all positive or all negative numbers (since mixing signs could create zero sums)
2. The maximum size would be ⌊(n+1)/2⌋ for either the positive or negative side

The proposed answer is 2*⌊(n+1)/2⌋, which is incorrect because:
1. It's double the correct answer
2. You can't take both positive and negative numbers without risking zero sums (e.g., x + (-x) + 0 = 0)
3. The maximum is achieved by taking just one "side" (all positive or all negative)
