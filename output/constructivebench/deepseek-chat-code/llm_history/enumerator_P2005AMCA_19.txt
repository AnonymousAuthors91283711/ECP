This problem involves converting odometer readings that exclude digit '4' to actual miles traveled. The actual miles are computed by treating each digit in the odometer reading as follows: if the digit is â‰¥5, subtract 1 (since '4' is missing), otherwise keep it as is. We'll write a Python program to enumerate odometer readings and their corresponding actual miles for small values.

```python
def odometer_to_miles(odometer):
    """Convert odometer reading to actual miles by skipping digit '4'"""
    miles = 0
    for digit in str(odometer):
        d = int(digit)
        if d == 4:
            return None  # Invalid odometer reading
        adjusted = d - 1 if d >= 5 else d
        miles = miles * 10 + adjusted
    return miles

def enumerate_odometer(max_odometer=10000):
    """Enumerate valid odometer readings and their actual miles"""
    for o in range(1, max_odometer + 1):
        miles = odometer_to_miles(o)
        if miles is not None:
            print(f"Odometer: {o}, Actual miles: {miles}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Enumerating odometer readings and actual miles (up to 10000):")
    enumerate_odometer()
```
