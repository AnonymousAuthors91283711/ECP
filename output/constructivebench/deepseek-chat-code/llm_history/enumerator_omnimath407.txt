[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of real solutions to the equation arctan(x) = x² - 1.6. To enumerate possible solutions, we'll analyze the function f(x) = arctan(x) - x² + 1.6 and find its roots.

Approach:
1. Analyze behavior at ±∞: arctan(x) approaches ±π/2 while x² grows to +∞
2. Find critical points by computing f'(x) = 1/(1+x²) - 2x
3. Numerically evaluate f(x) at critical points and endpoints to count sign changes

The program will:
1. Find critical points numerically
2. Evaluate f(x) at these points and endpoints
3. Count sign changes to determine number of roots

```python
import math
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

def f(x):
    return math.atan(x) - x**2 + 1.6

def f_prime(x):
    return 1/(1 + x**2) - 2*x

# Find critical points by solving f'(x) = 0
critical_points = []
# Initial guesses based on behavior of f'(x)
for guess in [-0.5, 0.5]:
    try:
        cp = fsolve(f_prime, guess)[0]
        if abs(f_prime(cp)) < 1e-6:  # Verify it's actually a root
            critical_points.append(cp)
    except:
        pass

# Evaluate at critical points and endpoints
points_to_check = [-100] + sorted(critical_points) + [100]  # Large numbers approximate ±∞
values = [f(x) for x in points_to_check]

# Count sign changes
sign_changes = 0
for i in range(len(values)-1):
    if values[i] * values[i+1] < 0:
        sign_changes += 1

print(f"Critical points found: {critical_points}")
print(f"Function values at key points: {list(zip(points_to_check, values))}")
print(f"Number of real solutions: {sign_changes}")
```
