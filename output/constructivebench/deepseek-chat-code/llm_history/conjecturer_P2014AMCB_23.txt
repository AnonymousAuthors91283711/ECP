After k=61: sum mod 2017 = 1025
After k=62: sum mod 2017 = 1024
Final answer: 1024. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern in the enumerated answers, we can observe that the sum modulo 2017 follows a quadratic pattern in terms of k. The final value when k=62 is 1024, which is 2^10. This suggests a connection to powers of 2 in the solution.

The answer is:
<<<1024>>>
