This problem asks for the number of 3-element subsets of a 6×6 grid where no two distinct points share either a row or column (i.e., they form a "generalized diagonal"). We'll enumerate all possible combinations of 3 points that satisfy this condition.

The approach is:
1. Generate all possible combinations of 3 points from the 6×6 grid
2. Filter those where all points have distinct rows and distinct columns
3. Count the valid combinations

```python
from itertools import combinations

def count_valid_subsets():
    # Create all 6x6 grid points
    grid = [(i, j) for i in range(6) for j in range(6)]
    count = 0
    
    # Check all 3-point combinations
    for subset in combinations(grid, 3):
        rows = set()
        cols = set()
        valid = True
        for (x, y) in subset:
            if x in rows or y in cols:
                valid = False
                break
            rows.add(x)
            cols.add(y)
        if valid:
            count += 1
            print(subset)  # Print each valid subset
    
    print(f"Total valid subsets: {count}")

count_valid_subsets()
```
