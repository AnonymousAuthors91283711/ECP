[write_program]
This problem involves solving a trigonometric equation combined with a logarithmic condition. We need to find all θ in [0, 2π] such that 2a² - 3a + 1 = 0 where a = log_(1/2)(sinθ).

First, we'll solve the quadratic equation for 'a', then translate those solutions back to conditions on θ through the logarithmic relationship. The program will enumerate possible θ values that satisfy these conditions.

```python
import math

def solve_equation():
    # First solve the quadratic equation 2a^2 - 3a + 1 = 0
    a_solutions = []
    discriminant = 9 - 8  # 3^2 - 4*2*1
    a1 = (3 + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 4
    a2 = (3 - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 4
    a_solutions = [a1, a2]
    
    # Now find θ such that log_(1/2)(sinθ) equals a1 or a2
    # Which is equivalent to sinθ = (1/2)^a
    solutions = []
    for a in a_solutions:
        try:
            sin_theta = (0.5) ** a
            if -1 <= sin_theta <= 1:
                # Find principal solutions
                theta1 = math.asin(sin_theta)
                theta2 = math.pi - theta1
                # Add all solutions in [0, 2π]
                for base_theta in [theta1, theta2]:
                    for k in [-1, 0, 1]:  # Check nearby periods
                        theta = base_theta + 2 * math.pi * k
                        if 0 <= theta <= 2 * math.pi:
                            solutions.append(theta)
        except:
            continue
    
    # Remove duplicates and sort
    unique_solutions = sorted(list(set(solutions)))
    
    # Print all solutions
    print("Possible θ solutions in [0, 2π]:")
    for theta in unique_solutions:
        print(f"{theta:.5f} radians (≈ {math.degrees(theta):.2f}°)")
