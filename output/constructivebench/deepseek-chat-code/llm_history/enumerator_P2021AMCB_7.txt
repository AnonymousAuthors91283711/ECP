[write_program]
This problem involves calculating the ratio of the sum of odd divisors to the sum of even divisors of a specific number N = 34 × 34 × 63 × 270. We'll write a Python program to compute this ratio exactly.

Approach:
1. Factorize N into its prime factors
2. Generate all divisors from the prime factorization
3. Separate divisors into odd and even sets
4. Calculate sums for both sets
5. Compute the ratio in reduced form

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def factorize(n):
    factors = {}
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors[2] = factors.get(2, 0) + 1
        n = n // 2
    i = 3
    while i * i <= n:
        while n % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            n = n // i
        i += 2
    if n > 2:
        factors[n] = factors.get(n, 0) + 1
    return factors

def get_divisors(factors):
    divisors = [1]
    for p, exp in factors.items():
        temp = []
        for d in divisors:
            for e in range(exp + 1):
                temp.append(d * (p ** e))
        divisors = list(set(temp))
    return divisors

def main():
    # Calculate N = 34 × 34 × 63 × 270
    N = 34 * 34 * 63 * 270
    print(f"Calculating for N = {N}")
    
    # Factorize N
    factors = factorize(N)
    print(f"Prime factors: {factors}")
    
    # Get all divisors
    divisors = get_divisors(factors)
    
    # Separate odd and even divisors
    odd_divisors = [d for d in divisors if d % 2 != 0]
    even_divisors = [d for d in divisors if d % 2 == 0]
    
    # Calculate sums
    sum_odd = sum(odd_divisors)
    sum_even = sum(even_divisors)
    
    # Compute ratio
    ratio = Fraction(sum_odd, sum_even)
    print(f"Sum of odd divisors: {sum_odd}")
    print(f"Sum of even divisors: {sum_even}")
    print(f"Ratio (simplified): {ratio.numerator}/{ratio.denominator}")
