open Complex Polynomial

abbrev omnimath1776_answer : Set ℂ := sorry
theorem omnimath1776 (x : ℂ) : 
    x^4 + 2 * x^3 + 2 * x^2 + 2 * x + 1 = 0 ↔ x ∈ omnimath1776_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: { -1, I, -I }
Proposed Answer: {I, -I, -1}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer and ground truth answer contain exactly the same elements, just in a different order. Since sets are unordered collections, these two answers are equivalent. Both contain the roots of the polynomial equation: -1, i, and -i.
