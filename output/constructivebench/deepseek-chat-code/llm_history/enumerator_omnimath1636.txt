This problem involves summing over all possible 7-tuples of natural numbers, where each tuple is weighted by the sum of its elements divided by 3 raised to that sum. To approach this computationally, we'll:

1. Recognize that the infinite sum converges (as the denominator grows exponentially)
2. Implement a bounded enumeration of tuples where the sum is â‰¤ N (we'll use N=10 as a reasonable cutoff)
3. Compute the partial sums to observe convergence

The exact value would require mathematical analysis, but we can observe the trend numerically.

```python
from itertools import product
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    N = 10  # max sum of tuple elements to consider
    dim = 7  # dimension of tuples (Fin 7)
    total = Fraction(0, 1)
    
    for s in range(1, N+1):
        # Generate all tuples (a1,...,a7) where a1+...+a7 = s
        # Using stars and bars method to iterate through compositions
        for indices in product(range(s+1), repeat=dim-1):
            if sum(indices) <= s:
                a = list(indices) + [s - sum(indices)]
                if a[-1] >= 0:  # valid composition
                    weight = Fraction(s, 3**s)
                    # Multiply by multiplicity (number of permutations)
                    from math import factorial
                    from collections import Counter
                    cnt = Counter(a)
                    multiplicity = factorial(dim)
                    for v in cnt.values():
                        multiplicity //= factorial(v)
                    total += weight * multiplicity
                    print(f"Sum {s}, current total: {float(total)}")
    
    print(f"Final partial sum (up to sum={N}): {float(total)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
