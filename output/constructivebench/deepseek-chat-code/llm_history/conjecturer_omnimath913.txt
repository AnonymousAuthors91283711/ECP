Total numbers with odd sum: 55. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the enumerated answers, the pattern shows that numbers n with odd sum are perfect squares (1,9,25,49,81) and numbers just below perfect squares (n = k²-1). The count up to 100 would be 9 perfect squares (1² to 9²) plus 9 numbers just below (2²-1 to 10²-1), minus 1 since 10²-1=99 is included but 10²=100 is beyond our range. Total is 9+9=18, but the enumeration shows 55, so this initial pattern doesn't match. 

The correct pattern appears to be all numbers not divisible by 4. The count of numbers ≤100 not divisible by 4 is 75, but enumeration shows 55. 

Alternative observation: The enumerated n values are all odd or twice an odd number. The count of such numbers ≤100 is 50 odd + 25 twice-odd = 75, still not matching 55.

Given the enumeration shows exactly 55 numbers, and no clear pattern emerges, the answer is simply the count from enumeration:

<<<55>>>
