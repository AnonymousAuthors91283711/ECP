[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of triples (x, y, n) where x, y, n are positive integers with n > 1, satisfying x^n - y^n = 2^100. We'll write a program to enumerate small cases and look for patterns.

Key observations:
1. For n=2, it's a difference of squares: (x-y)(x+y) = 2^100
2. For n>2, solutions become rare due to growth of exponents
3. We can limit our search to reasonable bounds for x, y, n

```python
def count_solutions():
    # We'll use 2^10 instead of 2^100 for demonstration
    target = 2**10
    max_n = 20  # Since x^n grows rapidly, higher n unlikely to have solutions
    solutions = set()
    
    for n in range(2, max_n + 1):
        max_x = int((target + 1)**(1/n)) + 2
        for x in range(1, max_x + 1):
            x_pow = x**n
            if x_pow <= target:
                continue
            y_pow = x_pow - target
            y = round(y_pow ** (1/n))
            if y > 0 and y**n == y_pow:
                solutions.add((x, y, n))
                print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}, n={n}")
    
    print(f"Total solutions found: {len(solutions)}")

count_solutions()
```
