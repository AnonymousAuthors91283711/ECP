This problem appears to be about finding a function that relates s and t through the equation 0.1*s = t. The solution is straightforward algebra - we can solve for s in terms of t. The program will demonstrate this relationship numerically for sample values of t.

```python
def omnimath3428_answer(t):
    return t / 0.1  # Solving 0.1*s = t for s

# Test with sample values
sample_ts = [-2.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.14, 10.0]
print("Testing relationship 0.1*s = t for various t values:")
for t in sample_ts:
    s = omnimath3428_answer(t)
    print(f"t = {t:.2f} → s = {s:.2f} → 0.1*s = {0.1*s:.2f} (should equal {t:.2f})")
```
