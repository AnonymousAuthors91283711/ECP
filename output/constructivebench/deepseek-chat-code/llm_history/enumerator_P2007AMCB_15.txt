[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of equations derived from infinite geometric series. We'll write a Python program to numerically verify possible solutions for small rational values of r (since |r|<1) and find the corresponding a values that satisfy both equations.

The key steps are:
1. The first equation is a standard geometric series: a/(1-r) = 7
2. The second equation can be rewritten as (a*r)/(1-r²) = 3
3. We'll solve these equations for rational r values close to 0.5 (since the answer suggests r=1/2)

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def find_solutions():
    # Test rational r values between -1 and 1 with small denominators
    for denom in range(1, 10):
        for num in range(-denom + 1, denom):
            if num == 0:
                continue
            r = Fraction(num, denom)
            if abs(r) >= 1:
                continue
            
            # Solve first equation for a: a = 7*(1-r)
            a1 = 7 * (1 - r)
            
            # Solve second equation for a: a = 3*(1-r²)/r
            a2 = 3 * (1 - r**2) / r
            
            # Check if solutions match
            if a1 == a2:
                print(f"Found solution: a = {a1}, r = {r}")
                # Calculate the expression from the theorem (5/2)
                result = a1 * r**2
                print(f"a*r² = {result}")
