Looking at the pattern in the enumerated answers, we observe that the minimal degree candidate is always `2 * n`. This linear relationship holds for all given examples (n=2→4, n=3→6, etc.). The problem appears to be about finding the minimal degree of a polynomial that vanishes on certain symmetric point configurations.
