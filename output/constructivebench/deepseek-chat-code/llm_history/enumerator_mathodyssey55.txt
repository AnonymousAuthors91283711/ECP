This problem involves finding the value of f(6) given two quadratic functions f and g with specific conditions. The key is to determine the coefficients of f and g based on the given constraints.

We'll approach this by:
1. Expressing f and g in terms of their coefficients (a, b for f; c, d for g)
2. Using the given conditions to set up equations
3. Solving the system of equations to find the coefficients
4. Calculating f(6) with the found coefficients

The conditions are:
- g(6) = 35
- f(-1)/g(-1) = 21/20
- f(1)/g(1) = 21/20

    # We'll iterate through possible integer coefficients within a reasonable range
    # since the problem suggests exact values and simple fractions are involved
    
    # First, find possible (c,d) pairs from g(6) = 35
    # g(x) = x^2 + c*x + d
    # g(6) = 36 + 6c + d = 35 => 6c + d = -1
    possible_cd = []
    for c in range(-10, 11):
        d = -1 - 6*c
        possible_cd.append((c, d))
    
    # Now for each (c,d), find (a,b) that satisfy the ratio conditions
    for c, d in possible_cd:
        # f(x) = x^2 + a*x + b
        # Conditions:
        # f(-1)/g(-1) = 21/20 => (1 - a + b)/(1 - c + d) = 21/20
        # f(1)/g(1) = 21/20 => (1 + a + b)/(1 + c + d) = 21/20
        
        denom1 = 1 - c + d
        denom2 = 1 + c + d

        if denom1 == 0 or denom2 == 0:
            continue
            
        # From first ratio: 20(1 - a + b) = 21(1 - c + d)
        # From second ratio: 20(1 + a + b) = 21(1 + c + d)
        # Let's subtract these equations to eliminate b:
        # 20(-2a) = 21(-2c) => a = (21/20)c
        
        a = (21/20)*c
        
        # Now plug a back into one equation to find b
        # Using first equation: 20(1 - a + b) = 21(1 - c + d)
        b = (21*(1 - c + d) - 20*(1 - a)) / 20
        
        # Check if this (a,b) satisfies both equations
        lhs1 = 1 - a + b
        rhs1 = (21/20)*(1 - c + d)
        lhs2 = 1 + a + b
        rhs2 = (21/20)*(1 + c + d)
        
        if abs(lhs1 - rhs1) < 1e-6 and abs(lhs2 - rhs2) < 1e-6:
