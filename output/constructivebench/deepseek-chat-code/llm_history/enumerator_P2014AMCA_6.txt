This problem involves finding a two-digit number (10a + b) where:
1. a is the tens digit (1-9)
2. b is the units digit (0-9)
3. The difference between the number and its reverse equals 5 times the sum of digits
4. The sum of the number and its reverse is the answer we're seeking

We'll enumerate all two-digit numbers, check the conditions, and output valid candidates along with their sum with their reverse.

```python
def main():
    for a in range(1, 10):  # tens digit 1-9
        for b in range(0, 10):  # units digit 0-9
            num = 10 * a + b
            rev = 10 * b + a
            difference = num - rev
            digit_sum = a + b
            if difference == 5 * digit_sum:
                print(f"Found valid number: {num} (reverse: {rev})")
                print(f"Sum of number and reverse: {num + rev}")
                
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
