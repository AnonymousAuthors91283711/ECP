Ground Truth Answer: choose 100 50 * 2^98
Proposed Answer: 2 * 50 * 2^(50 - 1)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting the number of injective functions from Fin 100 to Fin 2 × Fin 50 with specific constraints about adjacent values in the second component.

2. The ground truth answer "choose 100 50 * 2^98" suggests:
   - First choosing 50 positions out of 100 for one value in Fin 2
   - The remaining 50 positions must take the other value in Fin 2
   - The 2^98 term likely comes from constraints on the Fin 50 component

3. The proposed answer "2 * 50 * 2^(50 - 1)" breaks down as:
   - 2 choices for the first element's Fin 2 component
   - 50 choices for the first element's Fin 50 component
   - 2^(50-1) for subsequent choices with adjacency constraints

The proposed answer seems incorrect because:
- It doesn't properly account for all 100 positions
- The exponent (50-1) doesn't match the problem scale
- The structure doesn't align with combinatorial choices needed
