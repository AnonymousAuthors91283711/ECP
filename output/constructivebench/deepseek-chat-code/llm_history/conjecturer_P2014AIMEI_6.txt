Based on the problem statement, we need to find the value of h that satisfies the given conditions involving quadratic equations with roots at natural numbers. The key observations are:

1. The first pair of equations (with coefficient 3) has roots x1 and x2, meaning h must be the average of these roots since they're symmetric about h.
2. Similarly, the second pair (with coefficient 2) has roots x3 and x4, also symmetric about h.
3. The distances from h to the roots can be determined from the equations: for the first pair, |x - h| = sqrt(-j/3) = sqrt(2013/3), and for the second pair |x - h| = sqrt(-k/2) = sqrt(2014/2).

The proposed answer correctly captures the average of these distances, but needs to be marked as noncomputable since it involves real number operations. Here's the corrected version:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2014AIMEI_6_answer : ℝ := (sqrt (2014 / 2) + sqrt (2013 / 3)) / 2>>>

Explanation:
- The answer combines the distances from the two quadratic equations
- sqrt(2014/2) comes from the second equation (coefficient 2)
- sqrt(2013/3) comes from the first equation (coefficient 3)
- The average is taken since h is the midpoint between roots in both cases
- The noncomputable annotation is required because we're working with real numbers[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to make the answer noncomputable since it involves real number operations (sqrt and division). The problem involves solving quadratic equations with given conditions, and the proposed answer combines the roots from both equations (with coefficients 3 and 2) in an average form.

The error occurs because Lean requires explicit marking of noncomputable definitions when they involve real numbers. The mathematical form looks correct as it averages the roots from the two different quadratic equations (one scaled by 3, the other by 2).

Here's the fixed answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2014AIMEI_6_answer : ℝ := (sqrt (2014 / 2) + sqrt (2013 / 3)) / 2>>>

Explanation:
1. The answer combines solutions from two quadratic equations:
   - First equation (coefficient 3): roots at h ± sqrt(2013/3)
   - Second equation (coefficient 2): roots at h ± sqrt(2014/2)
2. The average of the maximum roots (h + sqrt(2013/3) and (h + sqrt(2014/2)) would give h plus the average of the square root terms
3. Solving for h gives the proposed form
4. The `noncomputable` keyword is needed because real number operations aren't computable in Lean's kernel[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
