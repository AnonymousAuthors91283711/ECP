[write_program]
This problem asks to find all real pairs (x, y) that satisfy both equations:
1. x² + y = 12
2. y² + x = 12

We'll write a Python program to find these solutions numerically. Since exact solutions might involve radicals, we'll first look for obvious integer solutions, then use numerical approximation for others.

```python
import numpy as np

def find_solutions():
    # First check obvious integer candidates
    for x in range(-5, 5):
        y = 12 - x**2
        if abs(y**2 + x - 12) < 1e-6:
            print(f"Exact solution found: ({x}, {y})")
    
    # Now look for non-integer solutions numerically
    def equations(vars):
        x, y = vars
        eq1 = x**2 + y - 12
        eq2 = y**2 + x - 12
        return [eq1, eq2]
    
    from scipy.optimize import fsolve
    initial_guesses = [(-4, -4), (-3, 3), (0, 12), (3, 3), (4, -4)]
    for guess in initial_guesses:
        solution = fsolve(equations, guess)
        x, y = solution
        if abs(x**2 + y - 12) < 1e-6 and abs(y**2 + x - 12) < 1e-6:
            print(f"Approximate solution: ({x:.6f}, {y:.6f})")

find_solutions()
```
