This problem asks to find all real-valued functions f: ℝ → ℝ satisfying the functional equation:
∀x y, f(f(x) - f(y)) = f(f(x) + f(y)) - 4f(x)f(y)

We'll enumerate polynomial solutions of low degree (since polynomial solutions are common in such problems) and check them against the equation. We'll test constant, linear, and quadratic functions.

```python
def check_function(f, x, y):
    lhs = f(f(x) - f(y))
    rhs = f(f(x) + f(y)) - 4 * f(x) * f(y)
    return abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-9  # Account for floating point errors

def test_polynomials():
    # Test constant functions f(x) = c
    for c in [0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 0.5]:
        f = lambda x, c=c: c
        if all(check_function(f, x, y) for x in [-1, 0, 1] for y in [-1, 0, 1]):
            print(f"Constant solution: f(x) = {c}")

    # Test linear functions f(x) = a*x + b
    for a in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
        for b in [-1, 0, 1]:
            f = lambda x, a=a, b=b: a*x + b
            if all(check_function(f, x, y) for x in [-1, 0, 1] for y in [-1, 0, 1]):
                print(f"Linear solution: f(x) = {a}x + {b}")

    # Test quadratic functions f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c
    for a in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for b in [-1, 0, 1]:
            for c in [-1, 0, 1]:
                f = lambda x, a=a, b=b, c=c: a*x**2 + b*x + c
                if all(check_function(f, x, y) for x in [-1, 0, 1] for y in [-1, 0, 1]):
                    print(f"Quadratic solution: f(x) = {a}x^2 + {b}x + {c}")
