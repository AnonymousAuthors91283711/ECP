Ground Truth Answer: 9 / sqrt 23
Proposed Answer: sqrt (5 / 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the unique sum (a₁ + a₂ + a₃) of three positive real numbers that satisfy a system of equations.

2. The ground truth answer is 9/√23 ≈ 1.8765

3. The proposed answer is √(5/2) ≈ 1.5811

These are clearly different numerical values. The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the original system of equations when checked against the ground truth solution.
