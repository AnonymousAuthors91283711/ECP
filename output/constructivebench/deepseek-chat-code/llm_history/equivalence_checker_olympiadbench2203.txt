Ground Truth Answer: {t : ℝ × ℝ × ℝ | t = (0, 1, 1) ∨ t = (0, -1, -1) ∨ t = (1, 0, 1) ∨ t = (-1, 0, -1) ∨ t = (1, 1, 0) ∨ t = (-1, -1, 0) ∨ t = (1 / Real.sqrt 3, 1 / Real.sqrt 3, 1 / Real.sqrt 3) ∨ t = (-1 / Real.sqrt 3, -1 / Real.sqrt 3, -1 / Real.sqrt 3)}
Proposed Answer: {(1 / Real.sqrt 3, 1 / Real.sqrt 3, 1 / Real.sqrt 3), (-1 / Real.sqrt 3, -1 / Real.sqrt 3, -1 / Real.sqrt 3)} ∪
{(1, 1, 0), (-1, -1, 0)} ∪
{(1, 0, 1), (-1, 0, -1)} ∪
{(0, 1, 1), (0, -1, -1)}
<<<True>>>

The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both answers contain exactly the same set of solutions, just presented in a different organizational structure. The proposed answer groups the solutions into four separate sets (the symmetric case, and three permutations of the (a,b,0) cases), while the ground truth lists all eight solutions individually with disjunctions. Both include:
1. The symmetric solutions with all three coordinates equal to ±1/√3
2. All permutations where one coordinate is 0 and the other two are ±1
3. Both sign variants for each case

The content is identical, only the presentation format differs.
