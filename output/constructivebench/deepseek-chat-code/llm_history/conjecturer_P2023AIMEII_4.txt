Sum of squares: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the problem statement and the error message, I notice that:
1. The problem involves solving a system of symmetric equations (x+y+z, x²+y²+z², x³+y³+z³)
2. The enumerated answers show no solutions exist (empty set)
3. The sum of squares of an empty set should be 0
4. The error suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real numbers

The correct answer should be 0 since there are no solutions in the set S. Here's the fixed version:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2023AIMEII_4_answer : ℝ := 0>>>

Explanation:
1. The system of equations has no real solutions (as evidenced by the empty enumerated answers)
2. The sum of squares over an empty set is mathematically 0
3. The 'noncomputable' annotation is needed because we're working with real numbers in Lean
4. The answer matches the problem's requirements for the sum of squares of elements in S[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Sum of squares: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we can observe that:
1. The system of equations appears to have no real solutions (empty solution set)
2. The sum of squares of an empty set is indeed 0
3. The error in the proposed answer was due to incorrect syntax (duplicate declaration and misplaced noncomputable)

The correct answer should simply be 0, as the sum over an empty set is 0 by definition. Here's the fixed version:

<<<0>>>

Explanation:
1. The system x+y+z=1, x²+y²+z²=2, x³+y³+z³=3 has no real solutions, as confirmed by the enumerated answers showing an empty solution set
2. The sum of squares over an empty set is mathematically defined to be 0
3. The error in the original proposal was purely syntactic (duplicate declaration), not mathematical
4. The answer needs no noncomputable annotation since it's a simple constant
