. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ × ℝ)
From the enumerated answers and error message, I can see that:
1. The exact solutions are (3,3) and (-4,-4)
2. There are approximate solutions involving sqrt(13) that correspond to (-1±√13)/2 pairs
3. The Lean syntax needs proper real number operations and parentheses

The error occurs because Lean requires explicit type annotations and proper real number operations. Here's the corrected version:

<<<{(3, 3), (-4, -4), 
    ((-1 - Real.sqrt 13)/2, (-1 + Real.sqrt 13)/2), 
    ((-1 + Real.sqrt 13)/2, (-1 - Real.sqrt 13)/2)}>>>

Explanation:
1. Used Real.sqrt instead of sqrt
2. Properly parenthesized the expressions with /2 outside
3. Maintained all four solutions from the original problem
4. The solutions come from solving the system x² + y = 12 and y² + x = 12, which gives symmetric solutions when x=y (3,3 and -4,-4) and asymmetric solutions involving √13
