This problem involves finding the value of M[0,2] in a 3x3 rational matrix M with specific constraints. The constraints include:
- Fixed values for M[0,0], M[0,1], M[1,1], M[2,2]
- Row sum equality between first and second rows
- Column sum equality between first and second columns
- Diagonal sum equality between main diagonal and another diagonal

We'll enumerate possible values for the unknown entries (M[0,2], M[1,0], M[1,2], M[2,0], M[2,1]) that satisfy all constraints.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve_matrix():
    # Fixed values
    M00 = Fraction(8)
    M01 = Fraction(1)
    M11 = Fraction(5)
    M22 = Fraction(4)
    
    # We'll express all variables in terms of M02 (x)
    # From row sum equality: M00 + M01 + M02 = M10 + M11 + M12
    # Let's express M10 + M12 = (M00 + M01 + M02) - M11 = 8 + 1 + x - 5 = 4 + x
    
    # From column sum equality: M00 + M10 + M20 = M01 + M11 + M21
    # Let's express M20 + M21 = (M00 + M10) - (M01 + M11) = (8 + M10) - (1 + 5) = 2 + M10
    
    # From diagonal equality: M00 + M11 + M22 = M02 + M11 + M20
    # Simplifies to: 8 + 5 + 4 = x + 5 + M20 => 17 = x + 5 + M20 => M20 = 12 - x
    
    # Now substitute M20 into column equation:
    # M20 + M21 = 2 + M10 => (12 - x) + M21 = 2 + M10 => M21 = M10 + x - 10
    
    # Let's choose M10 as parameter t
    for t_num in range(-10, 11):
        for t_den in range(1, 6):
            t = Fraction(t_num, t_den)
            # From row sum: M12 = (4 + x) - t
            # From diagonal: M20 = 12 - x
            # From column: M21 = t + x - 10
            
            # All entries must be rational numbers
            # We need to find x that makes all entries valid
            
            # Let's solve for x using the remaining constraints
            # We have M02 = x, M10 = t, M12 = 4 + x - t, M20 = 12 - x, M21 = t + x - 10
            
            # The matrix must satisfy all equations, so any x is valid as long as denominators are non-zero
            # Since we're looking for a specific solution, we can pick x that makes M21 simple
            # Let's try x = 10 - t (which makes M21 = 0)
            x = 10 - t
            M12 = 4 + x - t
            M20 = 12 - x
            M21 = t + x - 10
            
            # Verify all values are valid
            if M20.denominator != 0 and M21.denominator != 0 and M12.denominator != 0:
                print(f"Found solution with x = {x}")
                print(f"Full matrix:")
                print(f"[{M00}, {M01}, {x}]")
                print(f"[{t}, {M11}, {M12}]")
                print(f"[{M20}, {M21}, {M22}]")
                print("---")
                return  # Stop after first valid solution
