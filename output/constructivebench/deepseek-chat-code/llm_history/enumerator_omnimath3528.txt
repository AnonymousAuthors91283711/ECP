This problem involves finding all triples (w, l, t) of natural numbers that satisfy w + l + t = 3 and where there exists some goal counts (g_for, g_against) with g_for > g_against. The task is to enumerate all possible (w, l, t) triples and determine which ones satisfy the condition.

We'll approach this by:
1. Generating all possible (w, l, t) triples where w + l + t = 3
2. For each triple, checking if there exists goal counts where g_for > g_against
3. Printing the valid triples

```python
def main():
    # Enumerate all (w, l, t) triples where w + l + t = 3
    for w in range(4):
        for l in range(4 - w):
            t = 3 - w - l
            # Check if there exists g_for > g_against
            # For w wins: g_for > g_against in each win
            # For l losses: g_for < g_against in each loss
            # For t ties: g_for = g_against in each tie
            # So total g_for = sum of wins + sum of ties
            # total g_against = sum of losses + sum of ties
            # We need total g_for > total g_against
            # Which simplifies to wins > losses (since ties cancel out)
            if w > l:
                print(f"Valid triple: ({w}, {l}, {t})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
