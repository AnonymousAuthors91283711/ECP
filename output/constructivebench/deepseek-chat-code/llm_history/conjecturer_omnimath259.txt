theorem omnimath259
: {P : Polynomial ℝ | (∀ x y z : ℝ, x ≠ 0 ∧ y ≠ 0 ∧ z ≠ 0 ∧ 2 * x * y * z = x + y + z → (P.eval x / (y * z) + P.eval y / (z * x) + P.eval z / (x * y) = P.eval (x - y) + P.eval (y - z) + P.eval (z - x))) } = omnimath259_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing constant polynomials:
Found constant solution: P(x) = 0

Testing linear polynomials:
Found linear solution: P(x) = 0x + 0

Testing quadratic polynomials:
Found quadratic solution: P(x) = 0x^2 + 0x + 0

Note: The zero polynomial P(x) = 0 is always a solution.
