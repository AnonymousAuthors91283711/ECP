This problem asks for the maximum sum s = a + b = c + d where a,b,c,d are distinct positive integers with GCD constraints. We'll enumerate all possible quadruples (a,b,c,d) with sums up to a threshold (1000) and find the maximum sum satisfying the conditions.

```python
import math

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)

def find_max_sum():
    max_sum = 0
    # We'll check sums up to 1000 as per the problem's LCM constraint
    for s in range(4, 1001):  # Minimum sum is 4 (1+3=2+2 but digits must be distinct)
        found = False
        # Iterate through all possible a,b pairs that sum to s
        for a in range(1, s//2 + 1):
            b = s - a
            if a == b:
                continue
            # Iterate through all possible c,d pairs that sum to s
            for c in range(1, s//2 + 1):
                d = s - c
                if c == d:
                    continue
                # Check all distinctness conditions
                if len({a, b, c, d}) != 4:
                    continue
                # Check LCM condition
                lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
                lcm_cd = lcm(c, d)
                total_lcm = lcm(lcm_ab, lcm_cd)
                if total_lcm < 1000:
                    if s > max_sum:
                        max_sum = s
                        print(f"New max sum found: {s} with quadruple ({a},{b},{c},{d})")
                    found = True
                    break  # No need to check other c,d pairs for this s
            if found:
                break  # No need to check other a,b pairs for this s
    print(f"Final maximum sum: {max_sum}")

find_max_sum()
