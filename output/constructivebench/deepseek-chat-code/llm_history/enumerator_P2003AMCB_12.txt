This problem asks for the greatest natural number d that divides every positive even integer n. The answer should be the largest number that divides all even numbers, which is essentially the greatest common divisor of all even numbers.

We can approach this by:
1. Observing that all even numbers are divisible by 2
2. Checking if any larger number divides all even numbers
3. Realizing that no larger number can divide both 2 and 4 (for example), so 2 must be the answer

Here's a Python program that verifies this by checking small even numbers:

```python
def find_greatest_divisor_of_all_evens():
    # Start checking from 2 upwards
    max_d = 2
    # Check up to 100 even numbers to be confident
    for n in range(2, 202, 2):
        # Current candidate must divide all numbers checked so far
        if n % max_d != 0:
            # Find the actual GCD of all numbers up to n
            new_gcd = max_d
            for m in range(2, n+1, 2):
                new_gcd = gcd(new_gcd, m)
                if new_gcd == 1:
                    break
            max_d = new_gcd
            if max_d == 1:
                break
    print(f"The greatest divisor of all even numbers is: {max_d}")

from math import gcd
find_greatest_divisor_of_all_evens()
```
