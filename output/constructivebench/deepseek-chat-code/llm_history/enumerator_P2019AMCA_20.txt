[write_program]
This problem appears to be about calculating a probability involving coin flips and uniform distributions. The exact mathematical formulation is complex, but we can write a Python program to enumerate possible probability values and verify the given expression.

The program will:
1. Define the given probabilities (p_heads, p_tails, etc.)
2. Calculate the combined probability expression
3. Output the exact fractional value

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def calculate_probability():
    # Define all probabilities as exact fractions
    p_heads = Fraction(1, 2)
    p_tails = Fraction(1, 2)
    p_0 = p_heads * Fraction(1, 2)
    p_1 = p_heads * Fraction(1, 2)
    p_uniform = p_tails
    p_xy_uniform = p_tails * p_tails
    
    # Calculate each term of the probability expression
    term1 = p_0 * p_1
    term2 = p_1 * p_0
    term3 = p_0 * p_uniform * Fraction(1, 2)
    term4 = p_1 * p_uniform * Fraction(1, 2)
    term5 = p_uniform * p_0 * Fraction(1, 2)
    term6 = p_uniform * p_1 * Fraction(1, 2)
    term7 = p_xy_uniform * Fraction(1, 4)
    
    # Sum all terms
    total_prob = term1 + term2 + term3 + term4 + term5 + term6 + term7
    
    # Print the exact fractional result
    print(f"The exact probability is: {total_prob}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    calculate_probability()
```
