This problem involves finding a natural number `d` such that for the arithmetic sequence `a(n) = 10 + (n-1)*d`, we have `a(a(2)) = 100` and `a(a(a(3)))` equals some target value (which we need to find). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of `d` that satisfy the first condition, then compute the corresponding value of `a(a(a(3)))`.

```python
def main():
    # We'll search for d in a reasonable range (1 to 100)
    for d in range(1, 101):
        # Define the arithmetic sequence a(n) = 10 + (n-1)*d
        def a(n):
            return 10 + (n - 1) * d
        
        # Check the first condition: a(a(2)) == 100
        a2 = a(2)
        aa2 = a(a2)
        if aa2 == 100:
            # If condition met, compute a(a(a(3)))
            a3 = a(3)
            aa3 = a(a3)
            aaa3 = a(aa3)
            print(f"Found valid d = {d}, a(a(a(3))) = {aaa3}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
