[write_program]
This problem asks to find all integer pairs (x, y) that satisfy the equation x³ - y³ = 2xy + 8. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible solutions by checking small integer values within a reasonable range.

The approach:
1. Iterate x and y values within a symmetric range around zero
2. For each pair, check if the equation holds
3. Print valid pairs immediately when found
4. Since the equation is symmetric in x and y (with sign changes), we'll focus on non-negative x first

```python
def find_solutions():
    # We'll check a range that's likely to contain all solutions
    max_range = 20
    solutions = set()
    
    for x in range(-max_range, max_range + 1):
        for y in range(-max_range, max_range + 1):
            if x**3 - y**3 == 2*x*y + 8:
                # Avoid duplicate solutions due to symmetry
                if (x, y) not in solutions and (y, x) not in solutions:
                    solutions.add((x, y))
                    print(f"Found solution: ({x}, {y})")
    
    print("\nAll found solutions:")
    for sol in sorted(solutions):
        print(sol)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solutions()
```
