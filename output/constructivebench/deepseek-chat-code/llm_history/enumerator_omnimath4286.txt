[write_program]
This problem asks to find all integer pairs (x, y) where x is an integer and y is a natural number, such that x²(1 + x²) = -1 + 21ʸ. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible solutions by checking small values of y and solving for x.

The approach:
1. Iterate y from 0 upwards
2. For each y, compute the right-hand side: -1 + 21ʸ
3. Solve x²(1 + x²) = rhs for integer x
4. Since x²(1 + x²) must be non-negative, we can stop when rhs becomes negative
5. For each valid y, check if the equation has integer solutions

```python
def find_solutions():
    y = 0
    while True:
        rhs = -1 + (21 ** y)
        if rhs < 0:
            break  # No solutions for larger y since 21^y grows rapidly
        
        # Solve x^4 + x^2 - rhs = 0 (quadratic in x^2)
        discriminant = 1 + 4 * rhs
        if discriminant < 0:
            y += 1
            continue
        
        sqrt_disc = int(round(discriminant ** 0.5))
        if sqrt_disc * sqrt_disc != discriminant:
            y += 1
            continue
        
        x_squared = (-1 + sqrt_disc) // 2
        if x_squared < 0:
            y += 1
            continue
        
        x = int(round(x_squared ** 0.5))
        if x * x == x_squared:
            print(f"(x, y) = ({x}, {y})")
            print(f"(x, y) = ({-x}, {y})")
        
        y += 1

find_solutions()
```
