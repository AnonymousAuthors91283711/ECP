[write_program]
This problem is about finding the maximum number of disjoint pairs in a set of 17 elements where each pair has representatives whose values differ by at most 1 (mod 5). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible configurations and find the maximum number of such pairs.

The approach:
1. Represent the 17 elements as indices 0-16
2. Assign each element a value from 0-4 (Fin 5)
3. Find all possible disjoint pairs where the absolute difference is â‰¤1
4. Track the maximum number of such pairs across all possible assignments

```python
from itertools import combinations, product

def main():
    n = 17  # elements
    k = 5   # possible values (0-4)
    max_pairs = 0
    
    # We'll try all possible value assignments for small subsets first
    # For full enumeration, we'd need 5^17 assignments which is impractical
    # Instead we'll look for patterns and symmetric cases
    
    # Case 1: All elements have same value
    reps = [0]*n
    pairs = list(combinations(range(n), 2))
    max_pairs = len(pairs)  # all pairs satisfy difference=0
    print(f"All same: {max_pairs} pairs")
    
    # Case 2: Two values differing by 1 (e.g., 0 and 1)
    # Split into groups of a and b
    for split in range(1, n):
        a, b = split, n-split
        # Max pairs is min between complete graph on a and complete graph on b,
        # plus all a-b pairs (since difference is exactly 1)
        total = (a*(a-1))//2 + (b*(b-1))//2 + a*b
        if total > max_pairs:
            max_pairs = total
            print(f"Two values split {a}-{b}: {max_pairs} pairs")
    
    # Case 3: Three consecutive values (0,1,2)
    # Try balanced splits
    for a in range(1, n-1):
        for b in range(1, n-a):
            c = n - a - b
            # Pairs within each group plus adjacent groups
            total = (a*(a-1))//2 + (b*(b-1))//2 + (c*(c-1))//2 + a*b + b*c
            if total > max_pairs:
                max_pairs = total
                print(f"Three values split {a}-{b}-{c}: {max_pairs} pairs")
    
    # After testing cases, the maximum seems to be when all have same value
    print(f"Maximum number of pairs found: {max_pairs}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
