This problem appears to be a simple arithmetic calculation disguised as a theorem. The expression (2018 - 18 + 20) / 2 can be evaluated directly. I'll write a Python program that calculates this value exactly.

```python
# Calculate (2018 - 18 + 20) / 2 exactly
numerator = 2018 - 18 + 20
result = numerator / 2
print(result)
```
