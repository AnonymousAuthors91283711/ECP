The problem involves finding natural numbers a, b, c that satisfy a polynomial equation in r, where r is defined as √(√(53)/2 + 3/2). The solution must be unique and satisfy a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = some fixed answer.

We'll approach this by:
1. Computing r numerically (though we'll keep as much precision as possible)
2. Evaluating the polynomial equation for small natural numbers a, b, c
3. Checking which combination satisfies the equation within a reasonable tolerance
4. Outputting candidate triples and their squared sums

```python
import math

def main():
    # Compute r = sqrt(sqrt(53)/2 + 3/2)
    inner = math.sqrt(53) / 2 + 1.5
    r = math.sqrt(inner)
    
    # Precompute powers of r we'll need
    powers = {}
    for exp in [40, 44, 46, 50, 94, 96, 98, 100]:
        powers[exp] = r ** exp
    
    # Search reasonable ranges for a, b, c
    max_val = 20  # Empirical upper bound
    tolerance = 1e-6
    
    for a in range(1, max_val + 1):
        for b in range(1, max_val + 1):
            for c in range(1, max_val + 1):
                lhs = powers[100]
                rhs = (2 * powers[98] + 14 * powers[96] + 11 * powers[94] 
                       - powers[50] + a * powers[46] + b * powers[44] + c * powers[40])
                
                if abs(lhs - rhs) < tolerance:
                    sum_sq = a**2 + b**2 + c**2
                    print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, a²+b²+c²={sum_sq}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Let me analyze this problem and the provided program:

Judgement:
1. The problem involves finding natural numbers a, b, c that satisfy a specific polynomial equation in r, where r is defined as √(√(53)/2 + 3/2).
2. The program attempts to find these values by brute-force search within a limited range (1-20) and checks the equation with a tolerance for floating-point precision.
3. The program outputs nothing because either:
   - The correct values are outside the search range (max_val=20 is too small)
   - The tolerance (1e-6) is too strict for the floating-point calculations
4. The problem requires finding the unique solution (a,b,c) that satisfies the equation, then computing a² + b² + c².

The original program is rejected because:
1. It fails to find any solutions due to insufficient search range and/or tolerance issues
2. It doesn't explicitly output the final required answer (a² + b² + c²)
3. The floating-point approach needs adjustment for better precision

<<<False>>>

Here's a corrected version with:
- Larger search range
- Better floating-point handling
- Explicit final answer output
- Streaming of partial results

```python
import math

def main():
    # Compute r = sqrt(sqrt(53)/2 + 3/2) with higher precision
    inner = math.sqrt(53) / 2 + 1.5
    r = math.sqrt(inner)
    
    # Precompute powers of r we'll need
    powers = {}
    for exp in [40, 44, 46, 50, 94, 96, 98, 100]:
        powers[exp] = r ** exp
    
    # Search reasonable ranges for a, b, c
    max_val = 100  # Increased upper bound
    tolerance = 1e-4  # Adjusted tolerance
    
    found = False
    for a in range(1, max_val + 1):
        for b in range(1, max_val + 1):
            for c in range(1, max_val + 1):
                lhs = powers[100]
                rhs = (2 * powers[98] + 14 * powers[96] + 11 * powers[94] 
                       - powers[50] + a * powers[46] + b

Judgement:
The problem appears to be a mathematical theorem about finding natural numbers (a, b, c) that satisfy a specific polynomial equation involving a real number r defined as √(√(53)/2 + 3/2). The theorem states that these numbers are unique and their sum of squares equals some answer (omnimath2791_answer).

Since no program was provided, we need to create one that:
1. Computes the value of r accurately
2. Evaluates the polynomial equation to find suitable (a, b, c)
3. Verifies the uniqueness condition
4. Computes a² + b² + c²

The original submission is empty, so it must be rejected.

<<<False>>>

Here's a corrected Python program that solves the problem:

```python
import math

def main():
    # Compute r = sqrt(sqrt(53)/2 + 3/2)
    r = math.sqrt(math.sqrt(53)/2 + 1.5)
    
    # Compute powers of r needed for the equation
    r40 = r**40
    r44 = r**40 * r**4
    r46 = r**44 * r**2
    r50 = r**46 * r**4
    r94 = r**50 * r**44
    r96 = r**94 * r**2
    r98 = r**96 * r**2
    r100 = r**98 * r**2
    
    # Solve for a, b, c in the equation
    # r^100 - 2*r^98 - 14*r^96 - 11*r^94 + r^50 = a*r^46 + b*r^44 + c*r^40
    lhs = r100 - 2*r98 - 14*r96 - 11*r94 + r50
    rhs_div = lhs / r40  # divide through by r^40
    
    # The equation becomes: a*r^6 + b*r^4 + c = rhs_div
    # We'll round to nearest integer since a,b,c must be natural numbers
    # Try small natural numbers for a, b, c
    
    found = False
    for a in range(1, 100):
        for b in range(1, 100):
            # Solve for c: c = rhs_div - a*r^6 -
