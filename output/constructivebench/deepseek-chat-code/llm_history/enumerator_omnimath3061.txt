[write_program]
This problem asks for the greatest integer that can be formed by multiplying three distinct elements from the set S = {-6, -4, -2, 0, 1, 3, 5, 7}. We need to enumerate all possible combinations of three distinct elements from S, compute their products, and find the maximum value.

The Python program will:
1. Define the set S
2. Generate all combinations of 3 distinct elements
3. Calculate each product
4. Track and output the maximum product found

```python
from itertools import combinations

def main():
    S = {-6, -4, -2, 0, 1, 3, 5, 7}
    max_product = None
    
    for a, b, c in combinations(S, 3):
        product = a * b * c
        if max_product is None or product > max_product:
            max_product = product
            print(f"New max product: {product} from ({a}, {b}, {c})")
    
    print(f"\nFinal maximum product: {max_product}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
