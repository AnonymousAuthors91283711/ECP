This problem involves finding a polynomial P with specific evaluation properties and determining the product of two distinct integers where P(n) = n+3. We'll approach this by:
1. Modeling P as a quadratic polynomial (since it has exactly two fixed points)
2. Using the given points (17,10) and (24,17) to set up equations
3. Solving for the polynomial coefficients
4. Finding the roots of P(n)-(n+3)=0
5. Calculating their product

```python
def find_polynomial_and_roots():
    # We assume P is quadratic: P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
    # Using P(17)=10 and P(24)=17:
    # 289a + 17b + c = 10
    # 576a + 24b + c = 17
    # Subtract first equation from second:
    # 287a + 7b = 7 => 41a + b = 1 => b = 1 - 41a
    
    # Now find fixed points where P(n) = n + 3
    # an^2 + bn + c = n + 3
    # an^2 + (b-1)n + (c-3) = 0
    # We know there are exactly two solutions n1, n2
    
    # Let's parameterize c using P(17)=10:
    # c = 10 - 289a - 17b = 10 - 289a - 17(1-41a) = 10 - 289a -17 + 697a = -7 + 408a
    
    # The fixed point equation becomes:
    # an^2 + (1-41a-1)n + (-7+408a-3) = 0
    # an^2 -41a n + (-10+408a) = 0
    # Divide by a (a≠0):
    # n^2 -41n + (-10/a + 408) = 0
    
    # For integer solutions, -10/a must be integer
    # Possible a values: ±1, ±2, ±5, ±10
