This problem involves finding a linear sequence where aₙ = a₁ + (n-1)*d, with given values a₁₆=13 and a₃₀=20. We need to find the relationship between term value T and its position k. The Python program will enumerate possible values to help identify the pattern.

```python
def find_sequence():
    # Given aₙ = a₁ + (n-1)*d
    # We have two equations:
    # a₁ + 15d = 13 (from a₁₆)
    # a₁ + 29d = 20 (from a₃₀)
    # Subtract first from second: 14d = 7 ⇒ d = 0.5
    # Then a₁ = 13 - 15*0.5 = 5.5
    
    # Since terms must be natural numbers, we look for n where aₙ is integer
    d = 0.5
    a1 = 5.5
    
    results = []
    for k in range(1, 50):
        term = a1 + (k-1)*d
        if term.is_integer():
            T = int(term)
            print(f"a_{k} = {T}")
            results.append((k, T))
    
    print("\nObserved pattern:")
    for k, T in results:
        print(f"When T = {T}, k = {k}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_sequence()
```
