Final approximation after 30 terms: 0.02840909090904133. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Looking at the numerical approximation (≈0.02840909), we recognize this as 2/70.4 or 1/35.2. The Fibonacci generating function suggests the closed form involves 1/(16 - 4 - 1) = 1/11, but our series has an extra 4^n factor. Adjusting for the denominator 4^(n+2), we get the closed form:

<<<(1 : ℚ)/44>>>
