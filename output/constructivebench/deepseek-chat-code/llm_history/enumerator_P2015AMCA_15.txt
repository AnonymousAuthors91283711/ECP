This problem asks for the smallest natural number n such that 123456789 * 10^n is divisible by 2^26 * 5^4, and after removing all factors of 2 and 5, the remaining number is coprime with 10. We need to find the minimal n that satisfies these conditions.

The approach is to:
1. Factor out all 2s and 5s from 123456789 first
2. Calculate how many additional 2s and 5s are needed to reach the required exponents (26 and 4 respectively)
3. The minimal n will be the maximum between the needed additional 5s (since 10^n provides equal numbers of 2s and 5s)

```python
def count_factors(n, p):
    """Count how many times p divides n"""
    count = 0
    while n % p == 0 and n != 0:
        n = n // p
        count += 1
    return count

# Original number
num = 123456789

# Count existing factors of 2 and 5
count_2 = count_factors(num, 2)
count_5 = count_factors(num, 5)

# Required factors
required_2 = 26
required_5 = 4

# Calculate additional needed factors
additional_2 = max(0, required_2 - count_2)
additional_5 = max(0, required_5 - count_5)

# The minimal n is the maximum between additional_2 and additional_5
# because 10^n provides n factors of 2 and n factors of 5
min_n = max(additional_2, additional_5)

# Verify the remaining k is coprime with 10
k = (num * (10 ** min_n)) // (2**26 * 5**4)
if (k % 2 != 0) and (k % 5 != 0):
    print(min_n)
else:
    print("No solution found")
```
