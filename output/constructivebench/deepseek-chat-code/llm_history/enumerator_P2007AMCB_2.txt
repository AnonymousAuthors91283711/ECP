This problem involves calculating the average miles per gallon (mpg) for a round trip where one leg is driven by a car and the other by an SUV with different mpg ratings. The exact answer can be computed directly using the harmonic mean formula for two values.

Here's a Python program that computes the exact value as a fraction and its decimal approximation:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def calculate_average_mpg():
    distance = 120
    car_mpg = 30
    suv_mpg = 20
    
    # Total distance is round trip (2 * one-way distance)
    total_distance = 2 * distance
    
    # Total gallons used is sum of gallons for each leg
    total_gallons = Fraction(distance, car_mpg) + Fraction(distance, suv_mpg)
    
    # Average mpg is total distance divided by total gallons
    average_mpg = Fraction(total_distance) / total_gallons
    
    # Print exact fraction and decimal approximation
    print(f"Exact average mpg: {average_mpg}")
    print(f"Decimal approximation: {float(average_mpg):.2f}")

calculate_average_mpg()
```
