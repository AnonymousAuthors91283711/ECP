This problem asks for the number of integer values k in [-500, 500] such that there exists exactly one real x satisfying the equation log(kx) = 2log(x+2). We'll write a Python program to count these k values by solving the equation for each k and checking uniqueness.

The mathematical approach involves:
1. Transforming the equation to kx = (x+2)^2
2. Solving the quadratic equation x^2 + (4-k)x + 4 = 0
3. Checking when there's exactly one real solution (discriminant = 0) or when only one solution satisfies the original domain (kx > 0 and x+2 > 0)

```python
import math

def count_unique_solutions():
    count = 0
    for k in range(-500, 501):
        if k == 0:
            continue  # log(0) undefined
        
        # Quadratic coefficients: xÂ² + (4-k)x + 4 = 0
        a = 1
        b = 4 - k
        c = 4
        
        discriminant = b*b - 4*a*c
        
        if discriminant < 0:
            continue  # No real solutions
        
        if discriminant == 0:
            # Exactly one solution (double root)
            x = (-b) / (2*a)
            if k*x > 0 and x + 2 > 0:  # Check domain of original equation
                count += 1
        else:
            # Two distinct solutions, check how many satisfy original equation
            x1 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
            x2 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
            
            valid1 = (k*x1 > 0) and (x1 + 2 > 0)
            valid2 = (k*x2 > 0) and (x2 + 2 > 0)
            
            if valid1 != valid2:  # Exactly one valid solution
                count += 1
    
    print(f"Number of k values with unique solution: {count}")

count_unique_solutions()
