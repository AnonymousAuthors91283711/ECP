[write_program]
This problem involves finding the smallest natural number n such that the square root of the product of i/(i+1) for i from 1 to n-1 equals 1/8. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of n and compute the product to find when this condition is satisfied.

The key observation is that the product telescopes, so we can simplify the computation. The product ‚àè(i/(i+1)) from i=1 to n-1 equals 1/n, so the equation becomes sqrt(1/n) = 1/8, which simplifies to n = 64. However, we'll write the program to verify this by direct computation.

```python
import math

def compute_product(n):
    """Compute the product of i/(i+1) for i from 1 to n-1"""
    product = 1.0
    for i in range(1, n):
        product *= i / (i + 1)
    return product

def find_solution():
    """Find the smallest n where sqrt(product) equals 1/8"""
    target = 1/8
    for n in range(2, 100):  # Check up to n=100, which is more than enough
        product = compute_product(n)
        sqrt_product = math.sqrt(product)
        # Print all candidates that are close to the target
        if abs(sqrt_product - target) < 1e-10:
            print(f"Found candidate: n = {n}, sqrt(product) = {sqrt_product}")
            # Since we're looking for the smallest n, we can stop after first match
            print(f"Minimal solution found: n = {n}")
            return

find_solution()
```
