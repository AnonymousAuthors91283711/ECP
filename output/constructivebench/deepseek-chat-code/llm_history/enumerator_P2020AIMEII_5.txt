[write_program]
This problem involves finding the smallest positive integer n where the sum of its base-4 digits, when converted to base-8 and summed again, has at least one digit ≥10 in its base-16 representation. We'll write a Python program to enumerate candidates and find the minimal such n.

The approach:
1. Define functions to compute f(n) (sum of base-4 digits) and g(n) (sum of base-8 digits of f(n))
2. Check if g(n) has any base-16 digit ≥10
3. Enumerate n starting from 1 until we find the smallest such n

```python
def sum_digits(n, base):
    """Sum digits of n in given base"""
    s = 0
    while n > 0:
        s += n % base
        n = n // base
    return s

def has_large_digit(n, base, threshold):
    """Check if n has any digit >= threshold in given base"""
    while n > 0:
        if n % base >= threshold:
            return True
        n = n // base
    return False

def find_min_n():
    n = 1
    while True:
        # Compute f(n) = sum of base-4 digits
        f_n = sum_digits(n, 4)
        # Compute g(n) = sum of base-8 digits of f(n)
        g_n = sum_digits(f_n, 8)
        # Check if g(n) has any base-16 digit >= 10
        if has_large_digit(g_n, 16, 10):
            print(f"Found candidate: n={n}, g(n)={g_n} (hex: {hex(g_n)})")
            return n
        n += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    min_n = find_min_n()
    print(f"Minimal n found: {min_n}")
```
