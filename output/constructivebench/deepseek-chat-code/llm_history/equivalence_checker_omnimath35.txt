Ground Truth Answer: fun (x, y, z) => x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2 * x * y * z
Proposed Answer: fun (x, y, z) => x * y + z
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function that takes three positive integers (x,y,z) and returns an integer n, where n is not a perfect square.

2. The ground truth answer uses the formula x² + y² + z² + 2xyz, which is known in number theory as the Markov equation. Numbers of this form are never perfect squares (this is a known result).

3. The proposed answer uses x*y + z. This is much simpler and doesn't guarantee non-square results. For example:
   - (1,1,1) → 1*1 + 1 = 2 (not square, correct)
   - (1,2,2) → 1*2 + 2 = 4 (which is a square, incorrect)
   - (1,3,1) → 1*3 + 1 = 4 (square, incorrect)

The proposed answer fails to satisfy the condition that the result should never be a perfect square, while the ground truth answer correctly satisfies this condition.
