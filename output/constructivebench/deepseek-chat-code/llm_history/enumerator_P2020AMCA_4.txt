[write_program]
The problem asks to count all 4-digit numbers (from 1000 to 9999) where:
1. Every digit is even
2. The number is divisible by 5

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such numbers and count them. The key observations:
- For divisibility by 5, the last digit must be 0 (since 5 is odd and all digits must be even)
- The first digit can be 2,4,6,8 (since it's a 4-digit number)
- Middle digits can be 0,2,4,6,8

```python
count = 0
# First digit options (2,4,6,8)
first_digits = [2,4,6,8]
# Middle digits options (0,2,4,6,8)
middle_digits = [0,2,4,6,8]
# Last digit must be 0 (for divisible by 5 and even)
last_digit = 0

for d1 in first_digits:
    for d2 in middle_digits:
        for d3 in middle_digits:
            num = d1 * 1000 + d2 * 100 + d3 * 10 + last_digit
            print(num)  # Stream each valid number
            count += 1

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
