abbrev omnimath2184_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2184 :
  {x : Fin 2012 → ℤ | (∀ i : Fin 2012, 0 ≤ x i ∧ x i ≤ 2011) ∧ (2012 ∣ ∑ i : Fin 2012, (i + 1) * x i)}.ncard = omnimath2184_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=1: 1 sequences
n=2: 2 sequences
n=3: 9 sequences
n=4: 64 sequences
For n=2012, the number of sequences is 2013^2011. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<2013^2011>>>
