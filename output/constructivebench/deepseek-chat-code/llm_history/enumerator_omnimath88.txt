[write_program]
This problem involves finding the maximum number of subsets (each of size 2) of a 2n-element set such that any k+1 subsets contain at least two that intersect. The solution likely involves combinatorial bounds. We'll write a Python program to enumerate small cases and observe patterns.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def omnimath88_enumerator(k, n):
    universe_size = 2 * n
    max_m = 0
    
    # Try all possible m from 1 upwards
    for m in range(1, 100):  # Arbitrary upper bound
        found = False
        
        # Generate all possible collections of m pairs
        all_pairs = list(combinations(range(universe_size), 2))
        for collection in combinations(all_pairs, m):
            valid = True
            
            # Check all (k+1)-subsets of the collection
            for subset_indices in combinations(range(m), k+1):
                has_intersecting = False
                
                # Check all pairs in the subset
                for i, j in combinations(subset_indices, 2):
                    if not set(collection[i]).isdisjoint(collection[j]):
                        has_intersecting = True
                        break
                
                if not has_intersecting:
                    valid = False
                    break
            
            if valid:
                found = True
                break
        
        if found:
            max_m = m
            print(f"For k={k}, n={n}: found valid configuration with m={m}")
        else:
            break
    
    print(f"Maximum m for k={k}, n={n}: {max_m}")

# Test small cases
for k in range(1, 4):
    for n in range(1, 4):
        omnimath88_enumerator(k, n)
        print()
```
