[write_program]
This problem is a simple equation solving task where we need to find the value of `n` that satisfies the equation `3 * n = 6 * 2`. The solution is straightforward, but we'll write a Python program to demonstrate how to enumerate possible values systematically.

The equation simplifies to `3n = 12`, so the solution is `n = 4`. However, we'll write a program that checks possible values of `n` until it finds the correct one, demonstrating the enumeration approach.

```python
def find_solution():
    # We'll check values of n from 0 upwards until we find the solution
    for n in range(0, 10):  # Reasonable upper bound for this simple problem
        if 3 * n == 6 * 2:
            print(f"Solution found: n = {n}")
            return
    print("No solution found in the search range")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solution()
```
