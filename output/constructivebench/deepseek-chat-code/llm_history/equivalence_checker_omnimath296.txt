Ground Truth Answer: 49998
Proposed Answer: 2 * (300 - 1) * (300 - 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a 300×300 grid with certain constraints:
   - Four 100×100 corner regions must be false
   - The rest can be true or false
   - No 2×2 block can have a checkerboard pattern
   - We need to find the maximum number of adjacent cell pairs with different values

2. The ground truth answer is 49998

3. The proposed answer is 2*(300-1)*(300-1) = 2*299*299 = 178802

The proposed answer calculates the total number of adjacent pairs (horizontal and vertical) in the grid, but this doesn't account for:
- The constraints on the corner regions
- The checkerboard pattern restriction
- The fact that we're looking for the maximum number of differing pairs, not all possible pairs

The correct maximum occurs when we have a grid that's as "checkered" as possible without violating the constraints, which would give us about 49998 differing pairs (approximately 1/3 of the total possible adjacent pairs).
