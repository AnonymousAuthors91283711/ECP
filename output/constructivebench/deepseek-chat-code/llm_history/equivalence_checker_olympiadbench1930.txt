Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 2, 3), (2, 1, 3), (3, 1, 2), (1, 3, 2), (2, 3, 1), (3, 2, 1)}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both sets contain all permutations of (1, 2, 3), just listed in different orders. Since sets are unordered collections, the order of elements doesn't matter for equivalence. Both answers correctly identify all positive integer triples (a, b, c) that satisfy the equation a³ + b³ + c³ = (abc)².
