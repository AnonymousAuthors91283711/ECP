This problem involves trigonometric identities and rationalizing expressions to find sin(θ) in simplest form. We'll enumerate possible m and n values that satisfy the given equation and coprimality condition.

The approach:
1. Start with the given equation sinθ/(1+cosθ) = 2√2/7
2. Use trigonometric identities to express sinθ in terms of rational numbers
3. Enumerate possible m and n values that satisfy the derived relationship
4. Check coprimality and sum condition

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction
from math import gcd

def enumerate_solutions():
    # The given equation is sinθ/(1+cosθ) = 2√2/7
    # We'll use the identity tan(θ/2) = sinθ/(1+cosθ)
    # So tan(θ/2) = 2√2/7
    # Then using double angle formulas, we can find sinθ
    
    # Let t = tan(θ/2) = 2√2/7
    t = 2 * math.sqrt(2) / 7
    
    # sinθ = 2t/(1+t²) from double angle formula
    t_squared = t * t
    denominator = 1 + t_squared
    numerator = 2 * t
    
    # Rationalize the expression
    # Original expression: (2*(2√2/7)) / (1 + (2√2/7)²)
    # = (4√2/7) / (1 + 8/49) = (4√2/7) / (57/49) = (4√2*49)/(7*57) = (28√2)/57
    
    # So sinθ = -28√2/57 (negative since θ is in (π/2,π))
    # We need to find m,n such that sinθ = -m√2/n
    
    # Let's verify possible m and n values around this
    max_search = 100
    for n in range(1, max_search):
        for m in range(1, max_search):
            # Check if m√2/n ≈ 28√2/57
            # Which means m/n ≈ 28/57
            if abs(Fraction(m, n) - Fraction(28, 57)) < Fraction(1, 1000):
                if gcd(m, n) == 1:
                    print(f"Found candidate: m={m}, n={n}, sum={m+n}")
                    # Since 28 and 57 are coprime, this is the simplest form
                    return m + n
    
    print("No solution found in search range")
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = enumerate_solutions()
    if result is not None:
        print(f"Final answer: {result}")
```
