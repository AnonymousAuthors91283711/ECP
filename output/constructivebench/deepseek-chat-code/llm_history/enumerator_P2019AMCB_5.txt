[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that there exist natural numbers r, g, b satisfying:
12r = 20n, 14g = 20n, and 15b = 20n. Essentially, n must be a common multiple of the denominators when we solve for r, g, b in terms of n.

The Python program will:
1. Find the smallest n where 20n is divisible by 12, 14, and 15
2. This is equivalent to finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the reduced denominators
3. We'll compute n by finding LCM(12,14,15)/gcd(20,12,14,15) but simplified

```python
import math

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)

def compute_min_n():
    # The conditions imply n must be divisible by lcm of adjusted denominators
    # Original equations: r = (20n)/12, g = (20n)/14, b = (20n)/15
    # So n must be divisible by lcm(3,7,15)/gcd(20,12,14,15) etc.
    # Simplified calculation:
    denominator_lcm = lcm(lcm(12, 14), 15)
    numerator_gcd = math.gcd(math.gcd(20, 12), math.gcd(14, 15))
    min_n = denominator_lcm // numerator_gcd
    return min_n

print(compute_min_n())
```
