This problem involves counting the number of permutations of 7 elements (Fin 7) where for every consecutive pair (including the wrap-around pair f(6) and f(0)), the product (f(i)+1)*(f(j)+1) â‰¤ 20. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all valid permutations.

The approach is:
1. Generate all permutations of [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] (representing Fin 7)
2. Check the condition for each consecutive pair (including the wrap-around)
3. Count valid permutations

```python
from itertools import permutations

def solve():
    count = 0
    elements = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    
    for perm in permutations(elements):
        valid = True
        # Check consecutive pairs
        for i in range(6):
            a, b = perm[i] + 1, perm[i+1] + 1
            if a * b > 20:
                valid = False
                break
        # Check wrap-around pair
        if valid:
            a, b = perm[6] + 1, perm[0] + 1
            if a * b > 20:
                valid = False
        if valid:
            count += 1
            print(perm)  # Print each valid permutation
    
    print(f"Total valid permutations: {count}")

solve()
```
