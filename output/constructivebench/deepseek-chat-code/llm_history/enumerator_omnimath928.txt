This problem asks for the greatest natural number `d` such that there exists a positive integer `x` where `d` equals the difference between the sum of digits of `x+2019` and the sum of digits of `x`. 

To solve this, we'll:
1. Iterate through possible values of `x` up to a reasonable limit
2. For each `x`, compute the digit sum difference between `x+2019` and `x`
3. Track the maximum difference found

The key insight is that the maximum difference occurs when adding 2019 causes many carries, which reduce the digit sum. We'll search up to numbers where adding 2019 would affect multiple digits (like numbers ending with many 9s).

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

max_diff = 0
# We check numbers up to 10^6 since larger numbers won't produce bigger differences
for x in range(1, 10**6 + 1):
    diff = digit_sum(x + 2019) - digit_sum(x)
    if diff > max_diff:
        max_diff = diff
        print(f"New max difference {max_diff} found at x={x}")
        
print(f"Final maximum difference: {max_diff}")
```
