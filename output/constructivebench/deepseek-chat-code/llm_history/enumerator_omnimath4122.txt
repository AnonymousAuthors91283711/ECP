This problem involves finding pairs of positive integers (p₁, p₂) such that 5*F(p₁) - 3*F(p₂) = 1, where F is the Fibonacci sequence (F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(n+1)=F(n)+F(n-1) for n≥2). We'll write a Python program to enumerate such pairs up to a reasonable threshold.

The approach:
1. Precompute Fibonacci numbers up to a certain index
2. Iterate through all possible pairs (p₁, p₂) within bounds
3. Check if they satisfy the equation
4. Print valid pairs as they're found

```python
def main():
    # Precompute Fibonacci numbers up to index 50 (F(50) is large enough)
    fib = [0] * 51
    fib[1] = fib[2] = 1
    for n in range(3, 51):
        fib[n] = fib[n-1] + fib[n-2]
    
    max_p = 20  # Reasonable upper bound for p₁ and p₂
    
    print("Searching for pairs (p1, p2) where 5*F(p1) - 3*F(p2) = 1")
    print("Valid pairs found:")
    
    for p1 in range(1, max_p + 1):
        for p2 in range(1, max_p + 1):
            if 5 * fib[p1] - 3 * fib[p2] == 1:
                print(f"({p1}, {p2})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
