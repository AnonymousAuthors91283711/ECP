[write_program]
This problem involves finding the smallest natural number n ≥ 3 such that when we concatenate the digits of 2^(10*(k+1)) for k from 0 to n-1, the resulting number is congruent to 2^(10n) modulo 2^170. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible n values and check the condition.

The approach:
1. For each n starting from 3, compute the required powers of 2
2. Concatenate their digits
3. Check the modular condition
4. Stop when we find the smallest n satisfying the condition

```python
def main():
    # We'll check up to n=20 since 2^170 is very large and condition likely met before
    max_n = 20
    target_mod = 2**170
    
    for n in range(3, max_n + 1):
        concatenated = []
        # Compute each term 2^(10*(k+1)) for k=0..n-1
        for k in range(n):
            power = 10 * (k + 1)
            num = 2 ** power
            # Convert to digits and reverse to get correct order
            digits = list(map(int, str(num)))
            concatenated.extend(digits)
        
        # Convert concatenated digits back to number
        A = int(''.join(map(str, concatenated)))
        
        # Compute right side: 2^(10*n)
        rhs = pow(2, 10 * n, target_mod)
        
        # Check if A ≡ rhs mod 2^170
        if (A % target_mod) == rhs:
            print(f"Found solution at n = {n}")
            return
    
    print("No solution found in the tested range")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
