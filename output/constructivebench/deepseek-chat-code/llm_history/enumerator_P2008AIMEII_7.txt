This problem involves finding the value of an expression involving the roots of a cubic polynomial. The polynomial is given as x³ - 8x² - 200x + 2008 with roots r, s, t. We need to compute (r+s)(s+t)(t+r).

Using Vieta's formulas, we know:
1. r + s + t = 8
2. rs + rt + st = -200
3. rst = -2008

The expression (r+s)(s+t)(t+r) can be rewritten using these relationships. Note that r+s = 8-t, s+t = 8-r, and t+r = 8-s. Therefore, the product becomes (8-t)(8-r)(8-s).

We'll compute this by expanding and using Vieta's formulas.

```python
# Compute (r+s)(s+t)(t+r) for the polynomial x^3 -8x^2 -200x +2008
# Using Vieta's formulas: r+s+t=8, rs+rt+st=-200, rst=-2008

# The expression (r+s)(s+t)(t+r) equals (8-t)(8-r)(8-s)
# Expanding this gives 8^3 -8^2(r+s+t) +8(rs+rt+st) -rst
# Substituting Vieta's values: 512 -8^2*8 +8*(-200) -(-2008)

result = 512 - 512 - 1600 + 2008
print(result)
```
