[write_program]
The problem appears to be a Lean theorem (omnimath3299) with an undefined answer (omnimath3299_answer). Since we need to write a Python enumerator to help conjecture the answer, I'll assume this is about finding some mathematical pattern or property that needs to be discovered through enumeration.

For demonstration, I'll create a Python program that enumerates some mathematical properties that might be relevant to such problems (like prime numbers, perfect numbers, etc.), as the actual problem statement isn't provided. The program will output various mathematical sequences that could help in conjecturing the theorem's answer.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]:
        if n % p == 0:
            return n == p
    d = n - 1
    s = 0
    while d % 2 == 0:
        d //= 2
        s += 1
    for a in [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]:
        if a >= n:
            continue
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(s - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False
    return True

def perfect_numbers_up_to(limit):
    # Known perfect numbers formula: 2^(p-1)*(2^p-1) where 2^p-1 is prime (Mersenne prime)
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31]:
        n = (1 << (p - 1)) * ((1 << p) - 1)
        if n <= limit:
            print(f"Perfect number: {n} (p={p})")

print("Enumerating mathematical properties that might help conjecture the answer:")
print("\nPrimes up to 100:")
for n in range(2, 101):
    if is_prime(n):
        print(n, end=' ')
print("\n")

print("Perfect numbers up to 10000:")
perfect_numbers_up_to(10000)

print("\nPowers of 2 up to 1024:")
n = 1
while n <= 1024:
    print(n, end=' ')
    n *= 2
print("\n")

print("Fibonacci numbers up to 1000:")
a, b = 0, 1
while a <= 1000:
    print(a, end=' ')
    a, b = b, a + b
```
