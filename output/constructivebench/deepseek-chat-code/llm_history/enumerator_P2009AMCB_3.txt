The problem is to find the value of P2009AMCB_3_answer that satisfies the equation 0.8 * 60 = (4/3) * P2009AMCB_3_answer. We can solve this algebraically by isolating P2009AMCB_3_answer.

The Python program will compute the exact value by solving the equation step-by-step, showing the exact fractional form and decimal approximation.

```python
# Solve 0.8 * 60 = (4/3) * x for x
left_side = 0.8 * 60
x_exact = left_side * 3 / 4  # Multiply both sides by 3/4 to isolate x
x_decimal = x_exact

# Output both exact and decimal forms
print(f"Exact value: {x_exact}")
print(f"Decimal approximation: {x_decimal}")
```
