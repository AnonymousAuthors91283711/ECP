This problem is a Diophantine equation where we need to find a natural number `omnimath2905_answer` that satisfies the equation. The equation simplifies to finding when the product of numbers on the left equals the product on the right. We'll compute both sides and find the value that makes them equal.

```python
# Compute left and right sides of the equation to find omnimath2905_answer
left_side = 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 6
right_side_denominator = 5 * 6

# The equation is left_side = right_side_denominator * x^2
# So x^2 = left_side / right_side_denominator
x_squared = left_side / right_side_denominator

# x must be an integer, so we check if x_squared is a perfect square
x = int(x_squared ** 0.5)

# Verify if x^2 equals the computed value
if x * x == x_squared:
    print(x)
else:
    print("No integer solution found")
```
