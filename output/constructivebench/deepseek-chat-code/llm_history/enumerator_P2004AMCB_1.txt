[write_program]
This problem is asking to find the unique natural number x such that x multiplied by 2^4 equals 48. The solution can be found by simple arithmetic, but we'll write a Python program to enumerate possible answers to demonstrate the approach.

The program will:
1. Calculate 2^4 (which is 16)
2. Iterate through possible x values until finding one where x * 16 = 48
3. Since this is a simple linear equation, we can stop after finding the first solution

```python
# Find x such that x * 2^4 = 48
power = 2 ** 4  # 2^4 = 16
target = 48

# Iterate possible x values starting from 1
for x in range(1, target + 1):
    if x * power == target:
        print(f"Solution found: x = {x}")
        break  # Since we're looking for unique solution, we can stop after first match
```
