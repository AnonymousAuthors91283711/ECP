This problem involves calculating the expected number of moves in a game where we have numbers from 1 to 20 (excluding 0), and for each number k, we compute the sum of 1 divided by the count of numbers divisible by k. The solution requires enumerating all numbers from 1 to 20, computing the count of their multiples, and summing the reciprocals.

Here's a Python program that computes this:

```python
def main():
    numbers = set(range(1, 21))  # Numbers from 1 to 20
    total = 0.0
    
    for k in sorted(numbers):
        # Count how many numbers in the set are divisible by k
        count = sum(1 for d in numbers if d % k == 0)
        if count > 0:
            term = 1.0 / count
            total += term
            print(f"For k={k}, count={count}, adding {term:.6f} (current total: {total:.6f})")
    
    print(f"\nFinal sum: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program:
1. Creates a set of numbers from 1 to 20
2. For each number k, counts how many numbers in the set are divisible by k
3. Adds the reciprocal of this count to the running total
4. Prints intermediate results showing the contribution of each k
5. Finally prints the total sum

The output will show each step of the computation, making it easy to verify the calculations. The final sum represents the expected number of moves in the game.
