The problem asks to find all real numbers r such that there exist real numbers a and d (with a ≠ 0) satisfying the equation a² - 6ad + 8d² = 0 and r = d/a. 

We can approach this by:
1. Treating it as a quadratic in terms of d/a (which is r)
2. Solving the equation a² - 6ad + 8d² = 0 for r = d/a
3. Dividing by a² (since a ≠ 0) gives 1 - 6r + 8r² = 0
4. Solving this quadratic equation for r

Here's a Python program that calculates and prints the exact solutions:

```python
import sympy as sp

def solve_problem():
    # Define the variable
    r = sp.symbols('r')
    
    # The equation derived from the problem: 8r^2 -6r +1 = 0
    equation = 8*r**2 - 6*r + 1
    
    # Solve the equation
    solutions = sp.solve(equation, r)
    
    # Print each solution
    for sol in solutions:
        print(sol)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_problem()
```

The program uses sympy to solve the quadratic equation symbolically and prints the exact solutions. The output will be the two possible values of r that satisfy the given conditions. The solutions are exact fractions rather than decimal approximations.
