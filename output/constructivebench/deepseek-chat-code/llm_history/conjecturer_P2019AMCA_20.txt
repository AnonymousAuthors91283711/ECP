Based on the problem statement and the enumerated answer, we need to provide the correct probability value of 7/16 in Lean format. The error in the original code appears to be a syntax issue with the theorem statement rather than the answer itself.

The problem involves calculating a probability from a coin-flipping scenario with different outcomes:
- p_0 and p_1 represent probabilities of getting 0 or 1 from a heads outcome
- p_uniform represents a uniform probability from tails
- p_xy_uniform represents joint uniform probabilities

The correct answer is indeed 7/16, which can be verified by summing all the probability terms given in the problem statement. Here's the corrected Lean answer:
