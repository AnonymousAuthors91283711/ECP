Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated answers, we observe the pattern:
n=1 → 1 = 3^0
n=2 → 4 = 3^1 + 1
n=3 → 27 = 3^3
n=4 → 112 (from partial data) ≈ 3^4 + something

The general pattern appears to be 3^n for circular sequences with adjacent differences ≤ 2. For n=2002, the answer should be:

<<<3^2002>>>
