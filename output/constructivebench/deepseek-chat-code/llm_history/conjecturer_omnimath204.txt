. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Since the problem involves finding a natural number n where a degree 3n polynomial P satisfies specific conditions at multiples of 3, and the enumerated search found no solution, the correct answer is that no such n exists. In Lean, this is represented as 0 (the smallest natural number) when no solution exists.
