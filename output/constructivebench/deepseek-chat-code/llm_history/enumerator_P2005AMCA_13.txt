[write_program]
This problem involves finding a permutation of the numbers {3,5,6,7,9} and values a,d such that when arranged in a cycle, the sums of adjacent pairs form an arithmetic sequence. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible permutations and check for valid arithmetic sequences.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def solve():
    numbers = [3, 5, 6, 7, 9]
    found = False
    
    for perm in permutations(numbers):
        # We'll check all cyclic shifts of the permutation
        for shift in range(5):
            shifted = perm[shift:] + perm[:shift]
            s0 = shifted[0] + shifted[1]
            s1 = shifted[1] + shifted[2]
            s2 = shifted[2] + shifted[3]
            s3 = shifted[3] + shifted[4]
            s4 = shifted[4] + shifted[0]
            
            # Check if differences form arithmetic sequence
            d1 = s1 - s0
            d2 = s2 - s1
            d3 = s3 - s2
            d4 = s4 - s3
            d5 = s0 - s4  # Completing the cycle
            
            # All differences should be equal except for the last which should be -4d
            if d1 == d2 == d3 == d4 and d5 == -4 * d1 and d1 != 0:
                a = s2  # Middle term
                d = d1
                print(f"Found solution: permutation = {shifted}, a = {a}, d = {d}")
                found = True
    
    if not found:
        print("No solution found")

solve()
```
