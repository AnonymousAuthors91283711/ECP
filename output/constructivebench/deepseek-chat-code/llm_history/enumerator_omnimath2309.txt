[write_program]
This problem involves counting lattice paths with certain blocked conditions. The theorem states a relationship between the number of blocked paths and total paths, normalized by 36. We'll write a Python program to enumerate the possible values of `(total_paths - blocked_paths)/36` for x and y ≤ 5.

The program will:
1. Calculate total_paths = C(10,5) = 252
2. For each x,y ≤ 5, calculate blocked_paths = C(x+y,x) * C(10-x-y,5-x)
3. Compute the value (252 - blocked_paths)/36
4. Print all valid (x,y) pairs with their corresponding values

```python
from math import comb

def main():
    total_paths = comb(10, 5)
    print(f"Total paths: {total_paths}")
    print("(x, y) | Value")
    print("---------------")
    
    for x in range(6):
        for y in range(6):
            if x + y > 10 or 5 - x < 0 or 10 - x - y < 5 - x:
                continue  # invalid combination
            blocked = comb(x + y, x) * comb(10 - x - y, 5 - x)
            value = (total_paths - blocked) / 36
            print(f"({x}, {y}) | {value}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
