The problem asks to find the last digit of \(5^{35} - 6^{21}\). We can compute this by finding the last digit of each term separately and then subtracting them modulo 10.

Key observations:
1. Any power of 5 always ends with 5 (5, 25, 125, ...)
2. Powers of 6 cycle through 6, 6, 6, ... (since 6×6=36, 6×6×6=216, etc.)
3. Therefore \(5^{35}\) mod 10 is 5, and \(6^{21}\) mod 10 is 6
4. The result is (5 - 6) mod 10 = 9

Here's a Python program to verify this by computing the values directly:

```python
# Compute last digit of 5^35 - 6^21 mod 10
# Since Python can handle big integers, we'll compute directly

a = pow(5, 35)
b = pow(6, 21)
result = (a - b) % 10
print(result)
```
