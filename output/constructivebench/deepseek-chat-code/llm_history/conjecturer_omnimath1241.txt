. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the problem statement and enumerated answers, we can observe that:
1. The formula for tan(x+y) is being sought given tan x + tan y and cot x + cot y
2. The enumerated answers show a pattern where tan(x+y) = 4/(1 - product of tan x and tan y)
3. The error occurs because x and y are parameters in the theorem but not in the abbreviation

The correct solution should be a constant value since the theorem shows the result is independent of specific x,y values (as long as they satisfy h1 and h2). From the enumerated cases, we see the denominator simplifies to a constant value.

Looking at the pattern:
- tan(x+y) = (tan x + tan y)/(1 - tan x tan y) = 4/(1 - tan x tan y)
- From cot x + cot y = 5, we can derive tan x tan y = 4/5
- Therefore tan(x+y) = 4/(1 - 4/5) = 20
