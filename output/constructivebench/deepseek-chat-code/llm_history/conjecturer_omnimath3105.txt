Based on the given conditions, we can deduce that n must satisfy multiple congruence and division relations. The key constraints are:
1. n ≡ 1 mod 2, n ≡ 1 mod 3, n ≡ 1 mod 4
2. The division relations suggest n is between 36 and 48
3. The only number satisfying all conditions is 37 (37² - 37 = 1332, digit sum 9)
