Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Looking at the enumerated answers, the maximum difference occurs when (a,b,c) = (3,8,11) with value 264. The pattern suggests the maximum is achieved when a=3, b=8, c=11 (the largest possible distinct values in Icc 1 11 where a is maximized and b,c are as large as possible while distinct).
