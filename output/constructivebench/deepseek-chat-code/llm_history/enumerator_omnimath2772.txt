This problem involves finding the value of (a + b)/c given three positive integers a, b, c satisfying two equations. We'll enumerate possible integer values for a, b, c and check the conditions.

The approach:
1. From the first equation a + b/c = 101, we know b must be divisible by c (since a is integer)
2. From the second equation a/c + b = 68, we know a must be divisible by c
3. Let k = gcd(a,b,c), then we can write a = k*m*c, b = k*n*c
4. Substitute into equations to simplify the problem

```python
def solve():
    # We'll search for c up to 100 since larger values make a too small
    for c in range(1, 101):
        # a must be divisible by c (from second equation)
        for a in range(c, 101*c, c):
            # From first equation: b = c*(101 - a)
            b = c * (101 - a)
            if b <= 0:
                continue
            # Check second equation: a/c + b == 68
            if (a // c) + b == 68:
                result = (a + b) / c
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c} -> (a+b)/c = {result}")
                # Since we're enumerating from small c, first valid result is minimal c
                return  # Remove this to see all solutions

solve()
```
