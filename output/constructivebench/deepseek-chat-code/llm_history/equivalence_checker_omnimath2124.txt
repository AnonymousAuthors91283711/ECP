Ground Truth Answer: 181440
Proposed Answer: 9 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the count of 8-digit numbers (10,000,000 to 99,999,999) where:
   - The number is divisible by 9
   - All digits are distinct (no digit repeats)

2. The ground truth answer is 181440.

3. The proposed answer is 9 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3, which calculates to:
   9 * 9 = 81
   81 * 8 = 648
   648 * 7 = 4536
   4536 * 6 = 27216
   27216 * 5 = 136080
   136080 * 4 = 544320
   544320 * 3 = 1632960

   This equals 1,632,960, which is much larger than 181440.

4. The correct calculation should be:
   - First digit (leftmost): 9 choices (1-9)
   - Subsequent digits: 9,8,7,6,5,4,3 choices (0-9 excluding used digits)
   - Total permutations: 9 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 = 1,632,960
   - Then we need to count only those divisible by 9, which would be 1/9th of these: 1,632,960 / 9 = 181,440

The proposed answer gives the count before dividing by 9, so it's missing the divisibility condition.
