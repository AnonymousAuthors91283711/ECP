Testing non-linear functions (should not appear if correct):. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
From the enumerated answers, we see that all valid functions are constant functions with rational values. The condition requires that differences f(x)-f(y) are rational when x-y is rational, which is satisfied by constant functions (since f(x)-f(y)=0) and only by constant functions when combined with continuity. The constant must be rational to satisfy f(x)-f(y) ∈ ℚ when x-y ∈ ℚ.
