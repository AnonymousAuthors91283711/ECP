This problem involves factoring a complex number with irrational coefficients into a product of two similar complex numbers, then finding the minimal sum of coefficients. We'll enumerate possible factorizations by expanding the product and matching coefficients.

```python
import math

def enumerate_factorizations():
    # The target complex number is z = -142 + 333√5 i
    # We want z = (a + b√5 i)(c + d√5 i)
    # Expanding gives: (ac - 5bd) + (ad + bc)√5 i
    # So we need:
    # 1) ac - 5bd = -142
    # 2) ad + bc = 333
    
    min_sum = float('inf')
    
    # We'll search for a,b up to a reasonable limit
    max_ab = 100
    
    for a in range(1, max_ab + 1):
        for b in range(1, max_ab + 1):
            # From equation 2: ad + bc = 333 ⇒ d = (333 - bc)/a
            # We need d to be integer > 0
            if a == 0:
                continue
            
            # Try to find integer c that makes d integer
            for c in range(1, max_ab + 1):
                numerator = 333 - b * c
                if numerator <= 0:
                    continue
                if numerator % a != 0:
                    continue
                d = numerator // a
                if d <= 0:
                    continue
                
                # Check equation 1: ac - 5bd == -142
                if a * c - 5 * b * d == -142:
                    current_sum1 = a + b
                    current_sum2 = c + d
                    min_current = min(current_sum1, current_sum2)
                    print(f"Found factorization: ({a} + {b}√5i)({c} + {d}√5i), sums: {current_sum1}, {current_sum2}")
                    if min_current < min_sum:
                        min_sum = min_current
    
    print(f"\nMinimal sum found: {min_sum}")

enumerate_factorizations()
