[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number n that can be expressed as n = c + v where c and v are natural numbers satisfying 2*c*v*(c² + v²) = 4800. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible (c,v) pairs and find the minimal n.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible c values (since c and v are symmetric, we can assume c <= v)
2. For each c, compute possible v values that satisfy the equation
3. Check if v is an integer and positive
4. Track the minimal n = c + v found

```python
def find_min_n():
    min_n = float('inf')
    target = 4800
    
    # Iterate c from 1 upwards (since c <= v, we can stop when c exceeds possible values)
    for c in range(1, 100):
        # Calculate the remaining product needed from v
        denominator = 2 * c * (c**2)
        if denominator > target:
            continue
        
        # The equation is 2*c*v*(c² + v²) = 4800
        # Let's solve for v numerically
        # We can rearrange to: v*(c² + v²) = 2400/c
        rhs = 2400 / c
        
        # Binary search for v between c and a reasonable upper bound
        low = c
        high = 100
        for _ in range(100):  # precision iterations
            mid = (low + high) / 2
            val = mid * (c**2 + mid**2)
            if val < rhs:
                low = mid
            else:
                high = mid
        
        # Check if we found an integer solution near our approximation
        for v in [int(low), int(low)+1, int(high), int(high)+1]:
            if v <= 0:
                continue
            if 2 * c * v * (c**2 + v**2) == target:
                n = c + v
                print(f"Found solution: c={c}, v={v}, n={n}")
                if n < min_n:
                    min_n = n
    
    if min_n != float('inf'):
        print(f"Minimal n found: {min_n}")
    else:
        print("No solution found in search range")

find_min_n()
```
