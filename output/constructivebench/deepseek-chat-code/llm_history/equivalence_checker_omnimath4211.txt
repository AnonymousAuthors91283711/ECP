Ground Truth Answer: fun n => ((n ^ 4 * (n + 1) ^ 4) / 8)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if Odd n then 2 * n^5 else n^5 / 16
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves finding the GCD of S(n) and S(3n), where S(n) is defined as the sum of (p^5 + p^7) from p=1 to n.

2. The ground truth answer suggests the GCD is (n^4 * (n+1)^4)/8.

3. The proposed answer gives a piecewise function based on whether n is odd or even.

Comparing the two:
- For n=1: 
  Ground truth: (1^4 * 2^4)/8 = 16/8 = 2
  Proposed: 2*1^5 = 2 (matches)
  
- For n=2:
  Ground truth: (2^4 * 3^4)/8 = 16*81/8 = 162
  Proposed: 2^5/16 = 32/16 = 2 (doesn't match)

- For n=3:
  Ground truth: (3^4 * 4^4)/8 = 81*256/8 = 2592
  Proposed: 2*3^5 = 486 (doesn't match)

The answers only match for n=1 but diverge for other values. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
