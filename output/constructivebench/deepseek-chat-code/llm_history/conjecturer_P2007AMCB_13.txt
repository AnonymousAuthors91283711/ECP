From the problem statement and error message, I can see that:
1. The problem involves calculating a ratio of time intervals
2. The cycle is 30 + 3 + 30 = 63 units
3. The change intervals are 3 + 3 = 6 units
4. The ratio should be change_intervals/cycle = 6/63 = 2/21
5. The error is due to incorrect syntax in the theorem statement

The main issue is the missing line break between the two `let` bindings. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<2 / 21>>>

Explanation:
- The problem calculates the fraction of time spent in change intervals during a cycle
- Total cycle time is 30 + 3 + 30 = 63
- Change intervals total 3 + 3 = 6
- The ratio simplifies from 6/63 to 2/21
- The answer is a simple real number representing this ratio[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
