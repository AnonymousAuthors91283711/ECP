Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2 * n / 3) + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 6
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the maximum number of distinct triples (a,b,c) such that a+b+c = n, with all a's distinct, all b's distinct, and all c's distinct.

2. The ground truth answer suggests a linear growth (2n/3 + 1), which makes sense as we're constrained by the sum n and need distinct components.

3. The proposed answer gives a quadratic formula ((n+1)(n+2)/6), which would grow much faster than the ground truth.

4. For example, let's test n=3:
   - Ground truth: 2*3/3 + 1 = 3
   - Proposed: (3+1)(3+2)/6 = 20/6 ≈ 3.33 (but must be integer)
   The ground truth gives a reasonable answer (possible triples like (1,1,1), (2,0,1), (0,2,1)), while the proposed answer doesn't even give an integer.

5. For n=6:
   - Ground truth: 2*6/3 + 1 = 5
   - Proposed: (6+1)(6+2)/6 = 56/6 ≈ 9.33
   Again, the proposed answer is incorrect.
