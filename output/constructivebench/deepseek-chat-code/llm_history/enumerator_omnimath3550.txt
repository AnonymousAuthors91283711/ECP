[write_program]
This problem asks for all integer values of m where the polynomial P(m) = X^4 - (2m+4)X^2 + (m-2)^2 can be factored into two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients. We'll write a Python program to find all such m values by checking factorizations.

The approach is:
1. For each m in a reasonable range, construct the polynomial
2. Check if it can be factored into two quadratic polynomials
3. Output m if such a factorization exists

```python
from sympy import symbols, Poly, factor_list

def check_factorable(m):
    x = symbols('x')
    p = x**4 - (2*m + 4)*x**2 + (m - 2)**2
    factors = factor_list(p)
    # Check if there are at least two non-constant factors
    return len(factors[1]) > 1 or (len(factors[1]) == 1 and factors[1][0][1] > 1)

# Check m values in a reasonable range
print("Checking m values where P(m) is factorable:")
for m in range(-10, 11):
    if check_factorable(m):
        print(f"m = {m}")

# Also check some larger values
for m in range(11, 20):
    if check_factorable(m):
        print(f"m = {m}")

print("Checking negative values:")
for m in range(-20, -10):
    if check_factorable(m):
        print(f"m = {m}")
```
