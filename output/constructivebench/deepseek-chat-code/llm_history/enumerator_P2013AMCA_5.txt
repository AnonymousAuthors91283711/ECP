This problem involves calculating the difference between two values derived from sharing a total amount equally among three parties. The total is given as 105 + 125 + 175 = 405. When divided equally, each share is 135. The values t and d are the differences between this share and the original amounts (105 and 125 respectively). The final answer is t - d.

Here's a Python program that calculates this step-by-step:

```python
def calculate_answer():
    total = 105 + 125 + 175
    share = total // 3
    t = share - 105
    d = share - 125
    answer = t - d
    print(f"Total: {total}")
    print(f"Equal share: {share}")
    print(f"t = share - 105 = {t}")
    print(f"d = share - 125 = {d}")
    print(f"Final answer (t - d): {answer}")

calculate_answer()
```
