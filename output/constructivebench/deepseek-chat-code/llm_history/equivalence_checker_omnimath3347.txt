Ground Truth Answer: Real.sqrt 2
Proposed Answer: 1
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem describes an operation 'op' with specific properties:
   - Commutative (h_comm)
   - Continuous in each argument (h_cont)
   - Distributes over multiplication (h_distrib)
   - Special case: op 2 2 = 4

2. The ground truth answer suggests that the operation behaves like exponentiation, where op x y = x^y, since:
   - 2^2 = 4 matches h_special
   - The equation op x y = x would then be x^y = x, which implies y = 1 (when x ≠ 1)

3. The proposed answer is 1, which makes sense for x > 1 (hx : 1 < x) since:
   - For exponentiation, x^y = x implies y = 1 when x ≠ 1
   - The ground truth answer of √2 doesn't make sense here as it's not generally true that x^(√2) = x

4. The ground truth answer appears to be incorrect for this problem, while the proposed answer of 1 is correct.
