From the enumerated answers, we can observe that the polynomial has roots at 1/n for n=2,3,4,5,6 and the leading coefficient follows a pattern related to factorials. The general form appears to be the polynomial with roots at 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/(k+1) for degree k. The coefficient for x^2022 would be the product of denominators when expressed in terms of (x - 1/2)(x - 1/3)...(x - 1/2023).

Looking at the enumerated answers, we can observe a pattern in the leading coefficients (coefficient of highest degree term):

For degree 1: 2 = 2!
For degree 2: 6 = 3!
For degree 3: 24 = 4!
For degree 4: 120 = 5!
For degree 5: 720 = 6!

The pattern suggests that for a polynomial with roots at 1/n, 1/(n-1), ..., 1/2, the leading coefficient is (n+1)!. 

In the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of x^2022, which would correspond to a polynomial of degree 2022 with roots at 1/2023, 1/2022, ..., 1/2. Following the observed pattern, the leading coefficient should be (2023)!.

The error in the original proposed answer was due to incorrect factorial syntax in Lean. The correct way to write factorial in Lean is `Nat.factorial`.

Here's the corrected answer:
