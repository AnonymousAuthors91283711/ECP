The problem involves calculating the probability that a randomly chosen student taking Latin is a sophomore, given the percentages of each class taking Latin. We need to find this probability in reduced form m/n and output m+n.

Here's a Python program that calculates the exact probability and finds m+n:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve():
    total = 100
    # Number of students in each class
    freshmen = Fraction(4, 10) * total
    sophomores = Fraction(3, 10) * total
    juniors = Fraction(2, 10) * total
    seniors = Fraction(1, 10) * total
    
    # Number taking Latin in each class
    latin_freshmen = Fraction(10, 10) * freshmen
    latin_sophomores = Fraction(8, 10) * sophomores
    latin_juniors = Fraction(5, 10) * juniors
    latin_seniors = Fraction(2, 10) * seniors
    
    total_latin = latin_freshmen + latin_sophomores + latin_juniors + latin_seniors
    prob = latin_sophomores / total_latin
    
    # Simplify the fraction
    simplified = Fraction(prob).limit_denominator()
    print(f"Probability as fraction: {simplified}")
    print(f"Answer (m+n): {simplified.numerator + simplified.denominator}")

solve()
```

The program uses exact fractions to avoid floating-point inaccuracies. It calculates:
1. The number of students in each class
2. The number taking Latin in each class
3. The total number taking Latin
4. The probability a Latin student is a sophomore
5. The simplified form of this probability
6. Finally outputs m+n where the probability is m/n in lowest terms
