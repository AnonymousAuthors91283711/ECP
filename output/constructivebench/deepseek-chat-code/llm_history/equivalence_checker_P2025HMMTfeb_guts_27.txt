Ground Truth Answer: 341/32
Proposed Answer: 53/4
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer (341/32) and the proposed answer (53/4):

1. Convert both fractions to have common denominator:
   - 341/32 remains 341/32
   - 53/4 = 424/32

2. Compare numerators:
   - 341 vs 424
   - These are clearly different numbers

3. Check if they might be equivalent through simplification:
   - 341/32 is already in simplest form (GCD of 341 and 32 is 1)
   - 53/4 is also in simplest form (GCD of 53 and 4 is 1)
   - No further simplification possible

4. Decimal comparison:
   - 341/32 ≈ 10.65625
   - 53/4 = 13.25
   - These are not equal

The answers are not equivalent.
