This problem involves finding sequences `a_n` and `b_n` where `a_n` is arithmetic and `b_n` is geometric, such that their sum `c_n = a_n + b_n` satisfies specific conditions. We'll search for parameters `d` (common difference) and `r` (common ratio) that make `c_{k-1}=100`, `c_{k+1}=1000`, and `c_k` is the answer we're seeking.

We'll:
1. Iterate through possible values of `d` and `r`
2. For each pair, find `k` that satisfies the conditions
3. Output valid configurations and the corresponding `c_k`

```python
def main():
    # Search reasonable ranges for d and r
    for d in range(1, 100):
        for r in range(2, 20):
            # Try to find k where c(k-1)=100 and c(k+1)=1000
            for k in range(2, 20):
                a_km1 = 1 + (k-1 - 1) * d
                b_km1 = r ** (k-1 - 1)
                c_km1 = a_km1 + b_km1
                
                a_kp1 = 1 + (k+1 - 1) * d
                b_kp1 = r ** (k+1 - 1)
                c_kp1 = a_kp1 + b_kp1
                
                if c_km1 == 100 and c_kp1 == 1000:
                    a_k = 1 + (k - 1) * d
                    b_k = r ** (k - 1)
                    c_k = a_k + b_k
                    print(f"Found solution: d={d}, r={r}, k={k}, c_k={c_k}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
