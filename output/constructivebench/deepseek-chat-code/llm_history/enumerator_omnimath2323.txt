[write_program]
This problem involves finding real triples (a,b,c) that satisfy two equations:
1. a² + 2b² - 2bc = 16
2. 2ab - c² = 16

We'll write a Python program to numerically search for solutions by:
1. Iterating over possible values of a in a reasonable range
2. For each a, solving the second equation for c in terms of b
3. Substituting into the first equation to check for valid b values
4. Using small step sizes for approximation while checking for near-zero conditions

```python
import math

def find_solutions():
    # Search range and step size
    a_start, a_end = -5, 5
    b_start, b_end = -5, 5
    step = 0.01
    tolerance = 1e-6
    
    solutions = []
    
    a = a_start
    while a <= a_end:
        b = b_start
        while b <= b_end:
            # Solve second equation for c^2
            c_squared = 2*a*b - 16
            if c_squared >= 0:  # Only real solutions
                c = math.sqrt(c_squared)
                # Check first equation with both +c and -c
                for c_val in [c, -c]:
                    eq1 = a**2 + 2*b**2 - 2*b*c_val - 16
                    if abs(eq1) < tolerance:
                        solutions.append((round(a, 2), round(b, 2), round(c_val, 2)))
                        print(f"Found solution: a={round(a, 2)}, b={round(b, 2)}, c={round(c_val, 2)}")
            b += step
        a += step
    
    print("\nAll found solutions (rounded to 2 decimal places):")
    for sol in solutions:
        print(sol)

find_solutions()
```
