abbrev omnimath3401_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3401 (p : ℝ) (h : 0 ≤ p ∧ p ≤ 100) : 
  {q | q = 100 - p ∧ 0 ≤ q ∧ q ≤ 100} = {omnimath3401_answer p} := by sorry. Enumerated answers: For p = 0: q = 100
For p = 25: q = 75
For p = 50: q = 50
For p = 75: q = 25
For p = 100: q = 0
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
<<<fun p : ℝ => 100 - p>>>
