The problem involves comparing differences between terms in a sequence involving powers of 2004. We need to find which difference is the greatest among U-V, V-W, W-X, X-Y, and Y-Z. Since 2004 is large, we'll use a smaller base (like 2) to observe the pattern.

```python
def compute_differences(base, power):
    U = 2 * base**power
    V = base**power
    W = (base-1) * base**(power-1)
    X = 2 * base**(power-1)
    Y = base**(power-1)
    Z = base**(power-2)
    
    diffs = {
        'U-V': U - V,
        'V-W': V - W,
        'W-X': W - X,
        'X-Y': X - Y,
        'Y-Z': Y - Z
    }
    return diffs

# Test with smaller base and power to observe pattern
base = 2
power = 5
print(f"Testing with base={base}, power={power}")
diffs = compute_differences(base, power)
for name, value in diffs.items():
    print(f"{name}: {value}")

# Find which difference is greatest
max_diff = max(diffs.values())
for name, value in diffs.items():
    if value == max_diff:
        print(f"Greatest difference is {name}")
        break
```
