Ground Truth Answer: {0}
Proposed Answer: {Polynomial.C 0, Polynomial.C 1, Polynomial.X ^ 2}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all real polynomials P where for all x≠0, P(x)² + P(1/x)² = P(x²)*P(1/x²).

2. Ground truth is {0} (just the zero polynomial).

3. Proposed answer includes three polynomials: 0, 1, and x².

Testing the proposed polynomials:
- For P=0: Works (0+0=0*0)
- For P=1: 1² + 1² = 1*1 → 2=1 (False)
- For P=x²: (x²)² + (1/x²)² = (x⁴)*(1/x⁴) → x⁴ + 1/x⁴ = 1 (False for most x)

Only the zero polynomial satisfies the condition for all x≠0. The other two proposed solutions fail the condition.
