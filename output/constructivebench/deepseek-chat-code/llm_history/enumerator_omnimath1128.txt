This problem asks for the number of binary functions (f : Fin 15 â†’ Bool) where:
1. Exactly 6 inputs map to true (sum condition)
2. Every false must be adjacent to at least one true (circular condition)

We'll enumerate all possible combinations of 6 true values in a circular arrangement of 15 positions where no two falses are adjacent without a true between them. The solution involves counting valid circular binary strings with exactly 6 ones and 9 zeros where every zero has at least one adjacent one.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_valid(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == 0:
            left = arr[(i-1)%n]
            right = arr[(i+1)%n]
            if left == 0 and right == 0:
                return False
    return True

def count_valid_combinations(n, k):
    positions = range(n)
    count = 0
    for selected in combinations(positions, k):
        arr = [0]*n
        for pos in selected:
            arr[pos] = 1
        if is_valid(arr):
            count += 1
    return count

n = 15
k = 6
print(f"Counting valid circular arrangements of {n} positions with exactly {k} ones")
print(f"Total valid combinations: {count_valid_combinations(n, k)}")
```
