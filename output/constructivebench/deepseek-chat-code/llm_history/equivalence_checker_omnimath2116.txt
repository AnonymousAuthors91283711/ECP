Ground Truth Answer: Real.sqrt 109
Proposed Answer: Real.sqrt (58 - 42 * (-1)) + Real.sqrt (149 - 140 * Real.sqrt (1 - (-1) ^ 2))
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the infimum (greatest lower bound) of a set of real numbers defined by a specific expression over x ∈ [-1, 1].

2. The ground truth answer is √109.

3. The proposed answer is evaluating the expression at x = -1:
   √(58 - 42*(-1)) + √(149 - 140*√(1 - (-1)²)) = √100 + √149 = 10 + √149

This is clearly different from √109 (≈10.44 vs ≈10.44, but 10 + √149 ≈ 10 + 12.2 ≈ 22.2). Moreover, the proposed answer is just evaluating at one point rather than finding the infimum of all possible values in the interval.
