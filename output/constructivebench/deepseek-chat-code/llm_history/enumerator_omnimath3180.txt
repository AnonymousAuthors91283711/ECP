[write_program]
This problem involves solving for x in the equation 2^x = 16, then calculating 2^(x+3). We'll write a Python program to verify the solution by:
1. Solving 2^x = 16 (which gives x=4)
2. Calculating 2^(4+3) = 128
3. Printing the result

The program will be simple since we're just verifying a basic exponential equation.

```python
# Solve 2^x = 16 to find x, then calculate 2^(x+3)
x = 4  # since 2^4 = 16
result = 2 ** (x + 3)
print(result)
```
