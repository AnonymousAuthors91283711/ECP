[write_program]
This problem asks for the largest natural number n such that there exists a k ≤ n where k + (n - k) * (2/3) ≤ 30. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible n values and find the maximum valid one.

The approach:
1. Iterate n from 1 upwards
2. For each n, check all possible k values (0 to n)
3. Find if any k satisfies the inequality
4. Track the largest n where this holds

```python
def main():
    max_valid_n = 0
    # We'll check up to n=100 which is safely above the expected answer
    for n in range(1, 101):
        found = False
        for k in range(0, n + 1):
            # Calculate k + (n-k)*(2/3) and check if ≤ 30
            value = k + (n - k) * (2 / 3)
            if value <= 30 + 1e-9:  # Small epsilon for floating point
                found = True
                break
        if found:
            max_valid_n = n
            print(f"Found valid n: {n}")
    
    print(f"\nMaximum valid n: {max_valid_n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
