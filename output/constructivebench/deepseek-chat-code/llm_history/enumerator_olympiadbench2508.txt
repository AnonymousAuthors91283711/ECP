This problem involves finding the value of f(4) given a functional equation. The functional equation is defined for all x â‰  0. The strategy is to find a value of x that makes (2x+1)/x = 4, then use the functional equation to determine f(4).

Here's a Python program that:
1. Solves (2x+1)/x = 4 to find the appropriate x value
2. Computes f(4) using the functional equation
3. Outputs the exact value (as a fraction) and decimal approximation

```python
# Solve (2x + 1)/x = 4 for x
# 2x + 1 = 4x => 1 = 2x => x = 1/2

# Compute f(4) using the functional equation with x = 1/2
# f(4) = f((2*(1/2)+1)/(1/2)) = (1/2) + 6 = 13/2

# Output exact value and decimal approximation
print("Exact value as fraction:", "13/2")
print("Decimal approximation:", 13/2)
```
