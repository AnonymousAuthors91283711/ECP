[write_program]
The problem asks for the count of two-digit prime numbers (10 ≤ n ≤ 99) where both the tens digit (n/10) and units digit (n%10) are also prime numbers. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such numbers and count them.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]:
        if n % p == 0:
            return n == p
    return True

prime_digits = {2, 3, 5, 7}  # Single-digit primes
count = 0

for n in range(10, 100):
    tens = n // 10
    units = n % 10
    if tens in prime_digits and units in prime_digits and is_prime(n):
        print(n)
        count += 1

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
