abbrev omnimath96_answer : Set (ℤ → ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath96 :
  {f : ℤ → ℤ | ∀ a b c : ℤ, 2 * f (a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 + c ^ 2) - 2 * f (a * b + b * c + c * a) = f (a - b) ^ 2 + f (b - c) ^ 2 + f (c - a) ^ 2} = omnimath96_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing constant functions:
Found solution: f(x) = 0

Testing linear functions:
Found solution: f(x) = 1x + 0

Testing quadratic functions:
