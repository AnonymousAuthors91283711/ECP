[write_program]
This problem involves finding natural numbers c and s that satisfy three conditions: 3c = 4s, c = s + 4, and 3c equals some answer value. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of c and s that satisfy the first two equations, then compute 3c as the potential answer.

The approach is:
1. Iterate through possible values of s starting from 1
2. For each s, compute c = s + 4
3. Check if 3c equals 4s
4. When found, print s, c, and 3c (the answer)

```python
def find_solution():
    s = 1
    while True:
        c = s + 4
        if 3 * c == 4 * s:
            print(f"s = {s}, c = {c}, 3c = {3 * c}")
            return
        s += 1

find_solution()
```
