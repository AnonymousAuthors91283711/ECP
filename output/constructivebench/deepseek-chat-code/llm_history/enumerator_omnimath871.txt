This problem involves trigonometric identities and exact values. We'll compute the exact value of the expression sin(a+b)*sin(a-b) where a=arcsin(0.5) and b=arcsin(0.4). Using trigonometric identities, we know that sin(a+b)*sin(a-b) = sin²a - sin²b. Since sin(arcsin x) = x, this simplifies to 0.5² - 0.4² = 0.25 - 0.16 = 0.09.

Here's a Python program that verifies this computation numerically and symbolically:

```python
import math

def main():
    a = math.asin(0.5)  # arcsin(0.5)
    b = math.asin(0.4)  # arcsin(0.4)
    
    # Compute using original expression
    original = math.sin(a + b) * math.sin(a - b)
    
    # Compute using simplified identity sin²a - sin²b
    simplified = math.sin(a)**2 - math.sin(b)**2
    
    # Compute exact value 0.5² - 0.4²
    exact = 0.5**2 - 0.4**2
    
    print(f"Original computation: {original}")
    print(f"Simplified identity: {simplified}")
    print(f"Exact value: {exact}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program shows three equivalent ways to compute the value, demonstrating the trigonometric identity numerically. The exact value is 0.09 (9/100), which matches all computations.
