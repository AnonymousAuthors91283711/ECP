The problem asks for the smallest number ≥100000 that's divisible by 10,11,12,13,14,15, then to find the tens digit of that number divided by 10. We'll compute the LCM of these numbers, find the smallest multiple ≥100000, then extract the required digit.

```python
import math

def compute_answer():
    # Compute LCM of 10,11,12,13,14,15
    lcm = 1
    for n in [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]:
        lcm = lcm * n // math.gcd(lcm, n)
    
    # Find smallest multiple of lcm ≥100000
    min_num = ((100000 + lcm - 1) // lcm) * lcm
    
    # Compute (min_num / 10) % 10
    answer = (min_num // 10) % 10
    
    print(f"LCM: {lcm}")
    print(f"Smallest qualifying number: {min_num}")
    print(f"Answer (tens digit of n/10): {answer}")
