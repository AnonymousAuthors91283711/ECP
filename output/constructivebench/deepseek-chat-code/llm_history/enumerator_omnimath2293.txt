[write_program]
This problem asks for the count of numbers between 1 and 1,000,000 (exclusive) that are divisible by a perfect cube greater than 1. We'll write a Python program to count these numbers efficiently by:

1. Iterating through all possible cube bases k > 1
2. For each k, counting multiples of kÂ³ up to 999,999
3. Using inclusion-exclusion to avoid double-counting numbers divisible by multiple cubes

```python
def count_cube_divisible_numbers():
    max_n = 999999
    max_k = int(max_n ** (1/3)) + 1
    counted = set()
    total = 0
    
    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):
        k_cubed = k ** 3
        if k_cubed > max_n:
            continue
        
        # Count multiples of k_cubed
        count = max_n // k_cubed
        
        # Subtract numbers already counted by smaller cubes
        # that divide k_cubed (i.e., cubes of divisors of k)
        divisors = set()
        for d in range(2, int(k ** (1/3)) + 1):
            if k % d == 0:
                divisors.add(d)
        
        subtract = 0
        for d in divisors:
            d_cubed = d ** 3
            if k_cubed % d_cubed == 0:
                subtract += max_n // (k_cubed // d_cubed * d_cubed)
        
        total += count - subtract
    
    print(total)

count_cube_divisible_numbers()
```
