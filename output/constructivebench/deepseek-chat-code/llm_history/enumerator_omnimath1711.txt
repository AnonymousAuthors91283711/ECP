[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of three linear equations with three variables (x, y, z). The equations are:
1. x = y + z + 2
2. y = z + x + 1
3. z = x + y + 4

We need to find the value of x + y + z. The Python program will solve this system of equations symbolically and output the solution.

```python
import sympy as sp

def solve_system():
    x, y, z = sp.symbols('x y z')
    
    # Define the equations
    eq1 = sp.Eq(x, y + z + 2)
    eq2 = sp.Eq(y, z + x + 1)
    eq3 = sp.Eq(z, x + y + 4)
    
    # Solve the system
    solution = sp.solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (x, y, z))
    
    if solution:
        x_val = solution[x]
        y_val = solution[y]
        z_val = solution[z]
        sum_xyz = x_val + y_val + z_val
        print(f"x = {x_val}")
        print(f"y = {y_val}")
        print(f"z = {z_val}")
        print(f"x + y + z = {sum_xyz}")
    else:
        print("No solution found")

solve_system()
