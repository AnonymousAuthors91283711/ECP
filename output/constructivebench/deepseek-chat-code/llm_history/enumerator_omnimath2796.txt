This problem involves finding real numbers p and q such that for all real r, the quadratic equation in x (derived from x₁ + x₂ and x₁ * x₂) has two distinct negative roots exactly when p < r < q. We'll enumerate possible p and q values by solving the conditions.

The approach is:
1. For the quadratic x² - (r+7)x + (r+87) = 0 to have two distinct negative roots:
   - Discriminant must be positive
   - Sum of roots (r+7) must be negative
   - Product of roots (r+87) must be positive
2. Solve these inequalities to find p and q
3. Then compute p² + q²

```python
import math

def find_pq():
    # Solve discriminant condition: (r+7)^2 - 4(r+87) > 0
    # Which simplifies to r^2 + 10r - 299 > 0
    disc_root1 = (-10 - math.sqrt(100 + 1196)) / 2
    disc_root2 = (-10 + math.sqrt(100 + 1196)) / 2
    
    # Solve sum condition: r+7 < 0 => r < -7
    # Solve product condition: r+87 > 0 => r > -87
    
    # The valid range is intersection of all conditions
    p = max(disc_root1, -87)
    q = min(disc_root2, -7)
    
    # Verify p and q satisfy all conditions
    if (p > disc_root1 and p > -87 and 
        q < disc_root2 and q < -7 and 
        p < q):
        print(f"Found p = {p}, q = {q}")
        answer = p**2 + q**2
        print(f"p² + q² = {answer}")
    else:
        print("No valid p and q found")

find_pq()
```
