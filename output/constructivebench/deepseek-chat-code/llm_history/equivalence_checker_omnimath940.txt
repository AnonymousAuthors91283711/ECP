Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 14
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence a(n) where:
   - a(1) = 1
   - For n > 1, a(n) = gcd(a(n-1), n) + 1

2. We need to compute a(2002)

3. The ground truth answer is 3
4. The proposed answer is 14

To verify, let's compute some initial terms:
- a(1) = 1
- a(2) = gcd(1,2) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
- a(3) = gcd(2,3) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
- a(4) = gcd(2,4) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3
- a(5) = gcd(3,5) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
- a(6) = gcd(2,6) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3
- Continuing this pattern, we see the sequence oscillates between 2 and 3

For any n ≥ 4, the sequence will be either 2 or 3, never reaching 14. The ground truth answer of 3 is correct, while 14 is clearly wrong.
