[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimal sum a+b+c+d where a,b,c,d are positive integers satisfying:
1. gcd(a,c)=1 and gcd(b,d)=1
2. gcd(a,b)≠1, gcd(b,c)≠1, gcd(c,d)≠1, gcd(d,a)≠1

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible quadruples (a,b,c,d) in order of increasing sum to find the minimal solution.

```python
import math
from itertools import product

def find_minimal_quadruple():
    max_sum = 20  # Start with a small threshold, increase if needed
    found = False
    
    for s in range(4, max_sum + 1):
        # Generate all possible a,b,c,d with sum s
        for a in range(1, s - 2):
            for b in range(1, s - a - 1):
                for c in range(1, s - a - b):
                    d = s - a - b - c
                    if d <= 0:
                        continue
                    
                    # Check conditions
                    gcd_ac = math.gcd(a, c)
                    gcd_bd = math.gcd(b, d)
                    if gcd_ac != 1 or gcd_bd != 1:
                        continue
                    
                    gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
                    gcd_bc = math.gcd(b, c)
                    gcd_cd = math.gcd(c, d)
                    gcd_da = math.gcd(d, a)
                    if (gcd_ab == 1 or gcd_bc == 1 or gcd_cd == 1 or gcd_da == 1):
                        continue
                    
                    print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, sum={s}")
                    return  # Return after finding first (minimal) solution
    
    print("No solution found within the current threshold")

find_minimal_quadruple()
```
