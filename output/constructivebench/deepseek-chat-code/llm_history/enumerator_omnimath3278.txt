[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimal number of 1's in the binary representation of any positive multiple of 2023. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal count by checking multiples of 2023 until we find the smallest binary digit count.

The approach:
1. Iterate through positive integers n starting from 1
2. For each n, compute 2023*n
3. Convert the result to binary and count the 1's
4. Track the minimum count found so far
5. Stop when we've checked enough multiples to be confident we've found the minimum

```python
def count_ones_in_binary(num):
    return bin(num).count('1')

def find_min_ones():
    min_ones = float('inf')
    n = 1
    max_tries = 100000  # Reasonable upper bound for demonstration
    
    while n <= max_tries:
        multiple = 2023 * n
        ones = count_ones_in_binary(multiple)
        if ones < min_ones:
            min_ones = ones
            print(f"n={n}, multiple={multiple}, ones={ones}")
            if min_ones == 1:  # Can't get smaller than 1
                break
        n += 1
    
    print(f"Minimum number of 1's found: {min_ones}")

find_min_ones()
```
