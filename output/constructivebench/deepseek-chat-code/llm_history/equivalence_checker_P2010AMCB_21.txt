Ground Truth Answer: 315
Proposed Answer: 105
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest positive integer 'a' such that there exists a polynomial P with integer coefficients where:
   - P evaluates to 'a' at x=1,3,5,7
   - P evaluates to '-a' at x=2,4,6,8

2. The ground truth answer is 315, while the proposed answer is 105.

3. The key observation is that the polynomial must satisfy P(k) = a*(-1)^(k+1) for k=1 to 8. This means the polynomial must oscillate between a and -a at these points.

4. The minimal such 'a' would be the least common multiple of the differences between these evaluation points. The correct minimal polynomial would have roots at x=1.5,3.5,5.5,7.5 (midpoints between the given points), and the minimal 'a' is indeed 315 (which is LCM of the required values).

5. 105 is too small because it doesn't account for all the necessary constraints - specifically, it would fail to satisfy all the evaluation conditions simultaneously.
