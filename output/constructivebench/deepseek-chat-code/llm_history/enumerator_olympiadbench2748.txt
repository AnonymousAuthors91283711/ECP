[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest integer n > 2023 such that the quadratic equation xÂ² - 13x - n = 0 has integer solutions. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal n by:

1. Iterating n starting from 2024 upwards
2. For each n, checking if the discriminant (13Â² + 4n) is a perfect square
3. The first n that satisfies this condition is our answer

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(num):
    root = math.isqrt(num)
    return root * root == num

T = 13
start_n = 2024

n = start_n
while True:
    discriminant = T * T + 4 * n
    if is_perfect_square(discriminant):
        print(f"Found solution: n = {n}")
        print(f"Minimal n > 2023 is: {n}")
        break
    n += 1
```
