Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern in the enumerated answers, we can observe that all numbers from 1 to 106 are included except powers of 2 (like 2,4,8,16,32,64). This suggests the answer is the count of numbers from 1 to 1000 that are not powers of 2.

<<<1000 - 10>>> 

Explanation: There are 10 powers of 2 between 1 and 1000 (2^0 to 2^9), so the count is 1000 - 10 = 990. The pattern matches the enumerated results where powers of 2 are missing.
