This problem involves counting the number of real-valued sequences of length 11 with specific boundary conditions and recurrence relations. The recurrence involves a geometric mean-like condition. We'll enumerate possible sequences numerically to count valid solutions.

The approach:
1. Start with f(0) = 4 and f(10) = 1024
2. For each possible sign pattern (since sqrt introduces Â± choices)
3. Numerically solve the recurrence relation
4. Count distinct valid sequences

We'll use small steps to maintain precision and check for real solutions.

```python
import math

def count_sequences():
    count = 0
    # We'll use binary representation to represent sign choices (0=+, 1=-)
    for signs in range(1024):  # 2^10 possible sign patterns
        f = [0.0] * 11
        f[0] = 4.0
        f[10] = 1024.0
        valid = True
        
        # Forward pass
        for n in range(1, 10):
            prev = f[n-1]
            if prev <= 0:
                valid = False
                break
            sign = -1 if (signs >> (n-1)) & 1 else 1
            term = (5/2) * math.sqrt(prev)
            f[n] = term - prev
            if f[n] <= 0:
                valid = False
                break
        
        if not valid:
            continue
            
        # Backward consistency check
        for n in range(9, 0, -1):
            next_val = f[n]
            prev = f[n-1]
            expected = (5/2) * math.sqrt(next_val * prev) - next_val
            if not math.isclose(prev, expected, rel_tol=1e-6):
                valid = False
                break
        
        if valid:
            count += 1
            print(f"Found valid sequence #{count}")
    
    print(f"Total sequences found: {count}")
    print(f"Answer mod 100: {count % 100}")

    count_sequences()
