theorem omnimath755 (a b c : ℝ)
  (h₁ : a + b + c = 100)
  (h₂ : a*b + b*c + c*a = 20)
  (h₃ : (a + b) * (a + c) = 24) :
  b*c ∈ omnimath755_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
Based on the problem constraints and typical patterns for such symmetric equations, the solution set for b*c likely consists of two possible values. The conditions form a symmetric system where a, b, c are roots of a cubic equation.
