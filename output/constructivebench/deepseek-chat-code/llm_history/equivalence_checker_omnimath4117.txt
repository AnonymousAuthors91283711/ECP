Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n^2 / 4 + n / 2
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n^2 / 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal number of marked points on an n×n grid (where n is even and positive) such that every point is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to at least one marked point.

2. The ground truth answer is n²/4 + n/2. For even n, this simplifies to (n² + 2n)/4.

3. The proposed answer is n²/2, which is exactly twice the first term of the ground truth answer and ignores the second term.

4. Let's test with concrete even values of n:
   - For n=2: Ground truth gives 4/4 + 2/2 = 2, which is correct (mark 2 points diagonally). Proposed gives 4/2=2 (accidentally correct).
   - For n=4: Ground truth gives 16/4 + 4/2 = 6, which is correct. Proposed gives 16/2=8 (too large).
   - For n=6: Ground truth gives 36/4 + 6/2 = 12, correct. Proposed gives 18 (too large).

The proposed answer is incorrect for all n>2 and only accidentally correct for n=2. The pattern clearly shows it's not equivalent to the ground truth.
