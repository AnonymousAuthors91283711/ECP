abbrev omnimath2711_answer : ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath2711 : 
  IsLeast {x : ℤ | ∃ (k : ℤ), x = 2*k + 1 ∧ x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8) = 125} omnimath2711_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing x=15, sum=95
Testing x=17, sum=105
Testing x=19, sum=115
Testing x=21, sum=125
Found solution: x=21. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
<<<21>>>
