[write_program]
This problem involves finding the maximum number of black-white adjacencies on an n√ón grid where adjacency is defined by being within one unit in both coordinates (8-neighborhood). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible configurations for small n values to help conjecture the pattern.

The approach:
1. For small n (3 to 6), enumerate all possible grid configurations
2. For each configuration, count the number of adjacencies between white squares and their neighboring black squares
3. Track the maximum adjacency count found

```python
import itertools

def max_adjacencies(n):
    max_count = 0
    # Generate all possible grid configurations (as binary tuples)
    for bits in itertools.product([0,1], repeat=n*n):
        grid = [bits[i*n:(i+1)*n] for i in range(n)]
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 0:  # white cell
                    # Check all 8 neighbors (with bounds checking)
                    for di in [-1,0,1]:
                        for dj in [-1,0,1]:
                            if di == 0 and dj == 0:
                                continue
                            ni, nj = i+di, j+dj
                            if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                                count += 1
        if count > max_count:
            max_count = count
            print(f"n={n}, new max={max_count}")  # Stream partial results
    return max_count

# Test for small grid sizes
for n in range(3, 7):
    print(f"\nTesting n={n}")
    result = max_adjacencies(n)
    print(f"Final maximum for n={n}: {result}")
```
