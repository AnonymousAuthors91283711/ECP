This problem asks for the smallest denominator `d` that can appear in the sum of two rational numbers `x` and `y`, where `x` has denominator 60 and `y` has denominator 70. We'll enumerate possible denominators by considering all pairs of numerators for fractions with denominators 60 and 70, then compute their sums and find the minimal denominator.

The approach:
1. Generate all possible fractions with denominator 60 (numerator from 0 to 59)
2. Generate all possible fractions with denominator 70 (numerator from 0 to 69)
3. Compute their sums and find the reduced form denominator
4. Track the minimal denominator found

```python
import math

def compute_min_denominator():
    min_d = float('inf')
    
    # We'll iterate through all possible numerators for x (denominator 60)
    for a in range(60):
        x = (a, 60)
        
        # And all possible numerators for y (denominator 70)
        for b in range(70):
            y = (b, 70)
            
            # Compute sum x + y = (a*70 + b*60)/(60*70)
            numerator = a * 70 + b * 60
            denominator = 60 * 70
            
            # Simplify the fraction
            gcd_val = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)
            simplified_den = denominator // gcd_val
            
            # Update minimum denominator found
            if simplified_den < min_d:
                min_d = simplified_den
                print(f"New minimal denominator found: {min_d}")
                
                # Early exit if we find the theoretical minimum
                if min_d == 1:
                    return min_d
    
    return min_d

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = compute_min_denominator()
    print(f"\nFinal minimal denominator: {result}")
```

The program will output intermediate minimal denominators as they are found, and finally print the smallest possible denominator. The theoretical minimum is 1 (when the sum is an integer), but the actual minimal denominator in this case will be larger due to the specific denominators involved (60 and 70). The program efficiently checks all possible combinations while tracking the minimal denominator found.
