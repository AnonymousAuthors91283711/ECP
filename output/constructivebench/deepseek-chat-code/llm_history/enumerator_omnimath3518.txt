[write_program]
This problem is about solving a simple linear equation where we need to find the natural number input that satisfies the given equation. The equation simplifies to (input - 8)/2 + 16 = 32. We'll write a Python program to find this input value by testing possible natural numbers.

The approach is straightforward:
1. The equation can be rewritten as (input - 8)/2 = 16
2. Which further simplifies to input - 8 = 32
3. Finally giving input = 40

However, since we're asked to write an enumerator program, we'll test natural numbers around this expected solution to demonstrate the process.

```python
def solve_equation():
    # We'll test numbers from 30 to 50 to cover the expected solution
    for input in range(30, 51):
        left_side = ((input - 8) // 2) + 16
        if left_side == 32:
            print(f"Solution found: input = {input}")
            return  # Stop after finding the first solution
    print("No solution found in the tested range")

solve_equation()
```
