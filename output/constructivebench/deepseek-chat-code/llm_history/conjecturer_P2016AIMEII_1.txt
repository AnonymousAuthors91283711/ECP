Based on the problem statement and the geometric progression relationships (b = a*r, c = a*r^2), we can deduce that a must be a factor of 444 that fits all conditions. The most plausible solution is when r=3, leading to a=12 (since 12 + 36 + 396 = 444). The enumerated answers confirm this pattern.

<<<12>>>
