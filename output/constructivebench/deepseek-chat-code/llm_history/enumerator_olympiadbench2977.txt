[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest integer n > 1 where the product of all its divisors equals n^4. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal n by checking numbers sequentially and verifying the condition.

The key observations:
1. For any number n, the product of its divisors is n^(d(n)/2) where d(n) is the number of divisors
2. We need n^(d(n)/2) = n^4 ⇒ d(n)/2 = 4 ⇒ d(n) = 8
3. So we're looking for the smallest n > 1 with exactly 8 divisors

We'll first find numbers with exactly 8 divisors, then verify the product condition (though mathematically it's equivalent).

```python
def count_divisors(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    count = 1
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        exponent = 0
        while n % i == 0:
            exponent += 1
            n = n // i
        count *= (exponent + 1)
        i += 1
    if n > 1:
        count *= 2
    return count

def product_of_divisors(n):
    product = 1
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i * i == n:
                product *= i
            else:
                product *= i * (n // i)
    return product

n = 2
while True:
    if count_divisors(n) == 8:
        # Verify the product condition (though mathematically equivalent)
        if product_of_divisors(n) == n**4:
            print(n)
            break
    n += 1
```
