[write_program]
This problem asks for real numbers p, q, r such that (pq)(qr)(rp) = 16 and we need to find the value of pqr. Let's enumerate possible symmetric solutions where p = q = r to find candidates.

We'll compute (pq)(qr)(rp) = (p²)(p²)(p²) = p⁶ = 16 ⇒ p = 16^(1/6) = 2^(2/3)
Then pqr = p³ = (2^(2/3))³ = 2² = 4

The program will verify this symmetric case and also check some asymmetric cases to confirm 4 is indeed the consistent answer.

```python
import math

def main():
    # Check symmetric case p=q=r
    p = q = r = 2 ** (2/3)
    lhs = (p*q) * (q*r) * (r*p)
    product = p*q*r
    print(f"Symmetric case: (pq)(qr)(rp) = {lhs}, pqr = {product}")

    # Check some asymmetric cases
    cases = [
        (2, 2, 1),  # p=2, q=2, r=1
        (4, 1, 1),  # p=4, q=1, r=1
        (2**0.5, 2**0.5, 2)  # p=√2, q=√2, r=2
    ]
    
    for p, q, r in cases:
        # Adjust one variable to satisfy (pq)(qr)(rp) = 16
        # For p,q fixed, solve for r: (pq)(qr)(rp) = (pq)² r² = 16 ⇒ r = 4/(pq)
        r_adjusted = 4 / (p * q)
        lhs = (p*q) * (q*r_adjusted) * (r_adjusted*p)
        product = p * q * r_adjusted
        print(f"Asymmetric case p={p}, q={q}: (pq)(qr)(rp) = {lhs}, pqr = {product}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
