theorem omnimath2931 :
  ∃ (a b c : ℕ), 10 ≤ a ∧ a < 100 ∧ 10 ≤ b ∧ b < 100 ∧ 10 ≤ c ∧ c < 100 ∧
    a * b * c = 636405 ∧ a + b + c = omnimath2931_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found triplet: (77, 87, 95) with sum 259
Found triplet: (77, 95, 87) with sum 259
Found triplet: (87, 95, 77) with sum 259

Minimal sum found: 259 from triplet (77, 87, 95). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<259>>>
