Based on the problem statement and error message, I notice several issues:
1. The proposed answer 10 is correct numerically but needs proper Lean syntax
2. The error occurs due to missing line breaks/semicolons between let bindings
3. The rates should be simplified (60/48 = 5/4, 60/24 = 5/2)
4. The final answer should be a closed form expression

The correct solution involves:
1. Calculating individual rates (tasks per hour)
2. Summing them for total rate
3. Multiplying by 2 hours
4. Simplifying to get 10

Here's the fixed Lean answer:

<<<20 / 2>>>

Explanation:
- Dennis and Edward each complete 60 tasks in 48 hours → 5/4 tasks/hour each
- Shawn completes 60 tasks in 24 hours → 5/2 tasks/hour
- Combined rate: 5/4 + 5/4 + 5/2 = 5 tasks/hour
- In 2 hours: 5 * 2 = 10 tasks
- The simplified fraction 20/2 equals 10 and avoids floating point issues in Lean[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

From the problem statement and error message, I can see this is a work rate problem involving three people (Dennis, Edward, Shawn) working together. The error occurs because Lean requires semicolons or line breaks between let bindings.

Looking at the enumerated answers, we see the total work done in 2 hours is 10 tasks, which simplifies to 20/2. The key insight is that the rates need to be calculated correctly and summed before multiplying by time.

Here's the corrected answer in Lean:

<<<
60 / 48 + 60 / 48 + 60 / 24
>>>

Explanation:
1. Dennis and Edward both work at 60/48 tasks per hour (60 tasks in 48 hours)
2. Shawn works at 60/24 tasks per hour (60 tasks in 24 hours)
3. The total rate is the sum of individual rates
4. The answer is left in this form since the theorem statement shows it will be multiplied by 2 (hours) later

The error was fixed by properly separating the rate calculations and focusing on the core mathematical expression rather than the intermediate let bindings. The final answer represents the combined work rate per hour before time multiplication.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Simplified fraction: 20/2 tasks. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the problem and error message, I notice several issues:
1. The proposed answer is just summing the rates without multiplying by 2 hours
2. The rates should be simplified (60/48 = 5/4, 60/24 = 5/2)
3. The final answer should be a natural number (ℕ)

From the enumerated answers, we see the correct total is 10 tasks. The simplified fraction 20/2 also equals 10.

The error in the Lean code comes from missing semicolons between let bindings. Here's the corrected version that calculates the total work done in 2 hours:

<<<20 / 2>>>

Explanation:
- Dennis rate: 60/48 = 5/4 tasks/hour
- Edward rate: same as Dennis = 5/4
- Shawn rate: 60/24 = 5/2
- Combined rate: 5/4 + 5/4 + 5/2 = 5/4 + 5/4 + 10/4 = 20/4 = 5 tasks/hour
- In 2 hours: 5 * 2 = 10 tasks
- The simplified fraction 20/2 equals 10, which matches the enumerated answer and is a natural number as required.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
