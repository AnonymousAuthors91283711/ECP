This problem asks for the largest radius r such that there exists a center point c where every point p within distance r from c satisfies |p₁ + |p₂|| ≤ 1. We'll approach this by:

1. Parameterizing possible center points (c₁, c₂)
2. For each center, finding the maximum radius where the condition holds
3. Finding the maximum such radius across all possible centers

We'll use symmetry and consider centers along the x-axis (c₂=0) since the condition is symmetric in p₂.

```python
import math

def find_max_r():
    max_r = 0
    best_c = (0, 0)
    
    # Sample c₁ values around the interesting region [-1,1]
    for c1 in [x/100 for x in range(-150, 151)]:
        c = (c1, 0)
        
        # Find maximum r where condition holds
        # The worst case points are where p₂=0 and p₁ + |p₂| = ±1
        # So we need to consider p = (1,0) and p = (-1,0)
        r1 = math.sqrt((1 - c1)**2 + 0)  # distance to (1,0)
        r2 = math.sqrt((-1 - c1)**2 + 0)  # distance to (-1,0)
        
        # Also consider points where p₁ + |p₂| = 1 and p₂ ≠ 0
        # The minimal distance occurs when p₂ is maximized
        # Let p₁ = 1 - p₂ (for p₂ > 0)
        # Distance squared: (1-p₂-c1)^2 + p₂^2
        # Minimizing this gives p₂ = (1-c1)/2
        if c1 < 1:
            p2 = (1 - c1)/2
            p1 = 1 - p2
            r3 = math.sqrt((p1 - c1)**2 + p2**2)
        else:
            r3 = 0
            
        # Similarly for p₁ + |p₂| = -1 case
        if c1 > -1:
            p2 = (1 + c1)/2
            p1 = -1 - p2
            r4 = math.sqrt((p1 - c1)**2 + p2**2)
        else:
            r4 = 0
            
        current_r = min(r1, r2, r3, r4)
        
        if current_r > max_r:
            max_r = current_r
            best_c = c
            print(f"New max r: {max_r:.5f} at c=({c[0]:.3f}, {c[1]:.3f})")
    
    print(f"\nFinal maximum radius: {max_r:.5f}")

find_max_r()
