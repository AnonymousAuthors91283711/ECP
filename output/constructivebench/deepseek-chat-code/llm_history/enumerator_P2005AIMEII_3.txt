This problem involves finding a rational number r (in reduced form) such that two infinite series conditions are satisfied. We'll approach it by:
1. Using the geometric series formula for the first condition
2. Using the geometric series formula for squared terms for the second condition
3. Solving the resulting system of equations

The program will:
1. Iterate through possible denominators q up to a reasonable limit
2. For each q, iterate through possible numerators p (coprime with q)
3. Check if the resulting r=p/q satisfies both series conditions
4. Print valid candidates as they're found

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def solve_problem():
    max_denominator = 100  # Reasonable limit for demonstration
    target_sum1 = 2005
    target_sum2 = 20050
    
    for q in range(1, max_denominator + 1):
        for p in range(1, q):
            if math.gcd(p, q) != 1:
                continue  # Skip non-reduced fractions
            
            r = Fraction(p, q)
            # First condition: a/(1-r) = 2005
            try:
                a = target_sum1 * (1 - r)
            except:
                continue
            
            # Second condition: a²/(1-r²) = 20050
            lhs = a**2 / (1 - r**2)
            if abs(float(lhs) - target_sum2) < 1e-6:  # Account for floating point precision
                print(f"Found candidate: r = {r} = {float(r):.6f}")

### Explanation of Judgement

The original problem involves finding a rational number \( r \) (in reduced form) such that there exists a non-zero \( a \) where two infinite series conditions are satisfied:
1. \(\sum_{n=0}^\infty a r^n = 2005\)
2. \(\sum_{n=0}^\infty (a r^n)^2 = 20050\)

The program attempts to solve this by iterating over possible fractions \( r = p/q \) (with \( p \) and \( q \) coprime) and checking the conditions. However, the program fails to find any solutions because:
1. The floating-point comparison threshold (`1e-6`) is too strict for the exact rational arithmetic needed here.
2. The program doesn't properly handle the exact rational arithmetic required by the problem, leading to incorrect comparisons.

<<<False>>>

### Corrected Program
```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve_problem():
    target_sum1 = 2005
    target_sum2 = 20050
    
    for q in range(1, 101):  # Reasonable denominator limit
        for p in range(1, q):
            if p >= q or math.gcd(p, q) != 1:
                continue  # Ensure proper fraction and reduced form
            
            r = Fraction(p, q)
            # First condition: a = 2005*(1 - r)
            a = target_sum1 * (1 - r)
            if a == 0:
                continue  # Skip a=0 cases
            
            # Second condition: a² / (1 - r²) = 20050
            numerator = a ** 2
            denominator = (1 - r ** 2).denominator  # Exact rational arithmetic
            lhs = numerator / Fraction(denominator, 1)  # Exact division
            if lhs == target_sum2:
                print(f"Found solution: r = {r}")

### Explanation of Judgement

The original problem involves finding a rational number \( r \) (in reduced form) such that there exists a non-zero \( a \) where:
1. The infinite sum \( \sum_{n=0}^\infty a r^n = 2005 \)
2. The infinite sum \( \sum_{n=0}^\infty (a r^n)^2 = 20050 \)

The program attempts to solve this by iterating over possible denominators \( q \) and numerators \( p \) (ensuring \( p/q \) is in reduced form), then checks the two conditions. However, the program fails to output any results, indicating a logical or computational error.

### Issues with the Original Program:
1. **Incorrect Denominator Handling**: The denominator calculation for the second condition is flawed. The line `denominator = (1 - r ** 2).denominator` extracts only the denominator of \( 1 - r^2 \), but the correct denominator for the second condition should be \( 1 - r^2 \) itself (as the sum of squares involves \( \frac{a^2}{1 - r^2} \)).
2. **Exact Arithmetic**: The program attempts exact arithmetic but mishandles the division in the second condition. The correct approach is to compute \( \frac{a^2}{1 - r^2} \) exactly and compare it to `target_sum2`.
3. **Streaming Output**: The program correctly streams results as they are found, but due to the above issues, no results are found.

### Corrected Program:
The corrected program fixes the denominator handling and ensures exact arithmetic by using `Fraction` throughout. It also optimizes the search by iterating over denominators first and numerators second, ensuring reduced fractions.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
import math

def solve_problem():
    target_sum1 = 2005
    target_sum2 = 20050
    
    for q in range(1, 101):  # Reasonable denominator limit
        for p in range(1, q):
            if math.gcd(p, q) != 1:
                continue  # Ensure reduced form
            
            r = Fraction(p, q)
            a = target_sum1 * (1 - r)
            if a == 0:
                continue  # Skip a=0 cases
            
            # Compute a² / (1 - r²) exactly
            denominator
