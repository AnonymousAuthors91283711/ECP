So
Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated solutions, we can observe that for each natural number n from 0 to 40, there's exactly one solution x where ⌊x⌋ = n. The pattern suggests there's exactly one solution per integer floor value. Since the problem is about real numbers x with floor values up to 40 (as shown in the enumeration), and there's always exactly one solution per integer floor value, the total number of solutions is 41 (from n=0 to n=40 inclusive).
