[write_program]
This problem asks for the largest natural number n such that there exists a finite set V of size n and a relation E on V satisfying certain tournament-like conditions. We'll write a Python program to enumerate small values of n and check the conditions.

The key observation is that the condition requires that for any three distinct vertices A,B,C, exactly one of the three possible directed edges between them exists (either A→B, B→C, or C→A). This is similar to a tournament property.

```python
from itertools import product, combinations

def is_valid_tournament(n, edges):
    """Check if the tournament satisfies the given condition for all triples."""
    vertices = range(n)
    for a, b, c in combinations(vertices, 3):
        ab = (a, b) in edges
        bc = (b, c) in edges
        ca = (c, a) in edges
        # Exactly one of the three conditions must be true
        valid = (ab and not bc and not ca) or \
                (not ab and bc and not ca) or \
                (not ab and not bc and ca)
        if not valid:
            return False
    return True

def check_max_n(max_n=7):
    """Check all tournaments up to size max_n to find the largest valid n."""
    max_valid = 0
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        found = False
        # Generate all possible tournaments on n vertices
        for edges in product([False, True], repeat=n*(n-1)//2):
            # Convert to edge set representation
            edge_set = set()
            idx = 0
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(i+1, n):
                    if edges[idx]:
                        edge_set.add((i, j))
                    else:
                        edge_set.add((j, i))
                    idx += 1
            if is_valid_tournament(n, edge_set):
                print(f"Found valid tournament for n = {n}")
                found = True
                break
        if found:
            max_valid = n
        else:
            print(f"No valid tournament found for n = {n}")
    print(f"Largest valid n found: {max_valid}")

# Check tournaments up to size 7 (reasonable for demonstration)
check_max_n(7)
```
