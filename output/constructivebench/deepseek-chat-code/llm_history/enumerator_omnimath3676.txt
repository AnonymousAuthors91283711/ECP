[write_program]
This problem involves finding a function f:ℕ→ℕ such that for all k≥2 and all x∈(Fin k → ℕ), the sum of f(x_i)! divides the sum of x_i!. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible functions f for small values and look for patterns.

The approach will be:
1. Test small values of k (2 and 3)
2. For each possible input n, try to find f(n) that satisfies the divisibility condition
3. Look for patterns in the resulting function f

```python
import math
from itertools import product

def find_f(max_n=5, max_k=3):
    # We'll build f incrementally, testing each possible value for f(n)
    f = {}
    
    for n in range(max_n + 1):
        # Try possible values for f(n)
        for fn in range(n + 1):
            valid = True
            # Test for k=2 and k=3
            for k in range(2, max_k + 1):
                # Generate all possible x vectors where at least one element is n
                # and others are ≤n (since we're building f incrementally)
                for x in product(range(n + 1), repeat=k):
                    if n not in x:
                        continue
                    
                    sum_x_fact = sum(math.factorial(xi) for xi in x)
                    sum_f_fact = sum(math.factorial(f.get(xi, 0)) for xi in x)
                    
                    if sum_f_fact == 0 or sum_x_fact % sum_f_fact != 0:
                        valid = False
                        break
                if not valid:
                    break
            if valid:
                f[n] = fn
                print(f"f({n}) = {fn}")
                break
        else:
            print(f"Could not determine f({n})")
    
    print("\nCurrent f:", f)

find_f()
```
