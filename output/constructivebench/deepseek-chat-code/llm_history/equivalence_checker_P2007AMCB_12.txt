  (hSeniors : 9 * totalStudents / 10 * seniorsAvg ≤ overallAvg * totalStudents) :
  let juniorsCount := totalStudents / 10
  let seniorsCount := 9 * totalStudents / 10
  overallAvg * totalStudents = seniorsAvg * seniorsCount + P2007AMCB_12_answer totalStudents seniorsAvg overallAvg * juniorsCount := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun totalStudents seniorsAvg overallAvg => 
    (overallAvg * totalStudents - seniorsAvg * (9 * totalStudents / 10)) / (totalStudents / 10)
Proposed Answer: fun totalStudents seniorsAvg overallAvg => (overallAvg * totalStudents - 9 * totalStudents / 10 * seniorsAvg) * 10 / totalStudents
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground truth:
(overallAvg * totalStudents - seniorsAvg * (9 * totalStudents / 10)) / (totalStudents / 10)

Proposed:
(overallAvg * totalStudents - 9 * totalStudents / 10 * seniorsAvg) * 10 / totalStudents

1. The subtraction terms are identical (just reordered due to multiplication commutativity)
2. The ground truth divides by (totalStudents/10)
3. The proposed multiplies by (10/totalStudents)

Since division by (x/10) is equivalent to multiplication by (10/x) for x≠0, and we know totalStudents is divisible by 10 (from hTotal), these operations are equivalent.
