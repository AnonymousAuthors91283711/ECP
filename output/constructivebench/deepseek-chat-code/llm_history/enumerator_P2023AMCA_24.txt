This problem involves counting the number of sequences of subsets of {0,1,...,9} of length ≤10 where each subset is contained in the next (weakly increasing). The answer is modulo 10. We'll enumerate all possible sequences up to length 3 to observe the pattern, then compute the exact count using combinatorics.

```python
def count_sequences():
    n = 10  # size of the base set {0,1,...,9}
    max_length = 3  # sample small length for demonstration
    
    # Precompute all subsets (as binary numbers for efficiency)
    subsets = list(range(1 << n))
    
    # DP table: dp[l][s] = number of sequences of length l ending with subset s
    dp = [[0] * (1 << n) for _ in range(max_length + 1)]
    
    # Base case: sequences of length 1
    for s in subsets:
        dp[1][s] = 1
    
    # Fill DP table
    for l in range(2, max_length + 1):
        for s_prev in subsets:
            if dp[l-1][s_prev] == 0:
                continue
            for s_curr in subsets:
                if (s_prev & s_curr) == s_prev:  # s_prev ⊆ s_curr
                    dp[l][s_curr] += dp[l-1][s_prev]
    
    # Compute total count for lengths 1..max_length
    total = 0
    for l in range(1, max_length + 1):
        total += sum(dp[l])
        print(f"Count for length {l}: {sum(dp[l])}")
    
    print(f"Total for lengths 1..{max_length}: {total % 10} (mod 10)")

count_sequences()
