[write_program]
The problem asks to count the number of positive integers n such that n plus the sum of its digits plus the sum of the digits of that sum equals 2007. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such numbers up to a reasonable threshold (2007, since n must be â‰¤ 2007).

The approach is:
1. Iterate through all numbers from 1 to 2007
2. For each number, calculate the sum of its digits
3. Calculate the sum of digits of that sum
4. Check if n + digit_sum + digit_sum_of_digit_sum equals 2007
5. Count and print all valid numbers found

```python
def sum_digits(x):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(x))

count = 0
for n in range(1, 2008):
    s1 = sum_digits(n)
    s2 = sum_digits(s1)
    if n + s1 + s2 == 2007:
        print(n)
        count += 1

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
