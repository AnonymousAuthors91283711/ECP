[write_program]
This problem asks for the set of positive integers `a` such that for some 6-element subset `X` of integers, every integer `k` from 1 to 36 can be expressed as `a*x + y ≡ k mod 37` for some `x,y ∈ X`. We'll write a program to find all such `a` values up to a reasonable threshold.

The approach:
1. For each candidate `a` from 1 to 100, check if there exists a 6-element set X that satisfies the condition
2. For efficiency, we'll represent X as sorted tuples and check all combinations
3. We'll use modular arithmetic to check the coverage condition

```python
from itertools import combinations

def solve():
    modulus = 37
    target_range = range(1, modulus)
    X_size = 6
    max_a = 100
    
    for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
        # Try all possible X sets (mod 37) up to symmetry
        # We represent X as sorted tuples of distinct residues
        found = False
        for X in combinations(range(modulus), X_size):
            covered = set()
            for x in X:
                for y in X:
                    val = (a * x + y) % modulus
                    if 1 <= val < modulus:
                        covered.add(val)
            if len(covered) == modulus - 1:
                print(f"Found solution: a = {a} with X = {sorted(X)}")
                found = True
                break
        if found:
            continue

solve()
```
