Ground Truth Answer: 23
Proposed Answer: 72/529
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer step by step.

1. The problem involves calculating the ratio p1/p2 where:
   - p1 = (24 * 22! * 3!) / 26!
   - p2 = (23 * 23! * 2!) / 26!

2. To find p1/p2, we can simplify the expression:
   (p1/p2) = [(24 * 22! * 3!)/26!] / [(23 * 23! * 2!)/26!]
           = (24 * 22! * 3!) / (23 * 23! * 2!)
           = (24 * 3!) / (23 * 23 * 2!) [since 23! = 23 * 22!]
           = (24 * 6) / (23 * 23 * 2)
           = 144 / (23 * 46)
           = 144 / 1058
           = 72/529

3. The ground truth answer is 23, while the proposed answer is 72/529 ≈ 0.1361, which is clearly not equal to 23.

4. The proposed answer is mathematically correct in terms of the simplification process, but it doesn't match the ground truth answer of 23. This suggests there might be a misunderstanding in the problem setup or the intended calculation.
