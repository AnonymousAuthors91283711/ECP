[write_program]
This problem involves finding the value of f(π) given certain functional equations. We'll approach it by:
1. First finding the inverse of g(x) = 2x - 4
2. Using the given equation to derive f(x)
3. Finally evaluating f(π)

The program will verify the steps and compute f(π) symbolically.

```python
import sympy as sp

def solve_problem():
    # Define symbols and functions
    x = sp.symbols('x')
    g = lambda x: 2*x - 4
    
    # Find inverse of g
    g_inv = sp.solve(sp.Eq(y := sp.symbols('y'), g(x)), x)[0]
    
    # Given equation: g(f(g⁻¹(x))) = 2x² + 16x + 26
    # Substitute g⁻¹(x) into f
    # So f(g⁻¹(x)) = g⁻¹(2x² + 16x + 26)
    # Therefore f(x) = g⁻¹(2(g(x))² + 16g(x) + 26)
    
    # Compute f(x)
    f_expr = g_inv.subs(y, 2*g(x)**2 + 16*g(x) + 26)
    
    # Simplify f(x)
    f_simplified = sp.simplify(f_expr)
    
    # Evaluate at π
    f_pi = f_simplified.subs(x, sp.pi)
    f_pi_simplified = sp.simplify(f_pi)
    
    # Output results
    print("Derived f(x):", f_simplified)
    print("f(π) =", f_pi_simplified)
