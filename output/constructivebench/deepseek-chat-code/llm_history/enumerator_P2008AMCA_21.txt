This problem involves counting permutations of 5 elements where the sum of the first two elements is less than the sum of the last two elements in the permutation. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all permutations of [0,1,2,3,4] and count those satisfying the condition.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def main():
    count = 0
    elements = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    for perm in permutations(elements):
        # Check if sum of first two is less than sum of last two
        if perm[0] + perm[1] < perm[3] + perm[4]:
            count += 1
            print(perm)  # Print each valid permutation
    print("Total count:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
