[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number n that has three distinct positive divisors d1, d2, d3 (all dividing n) such that d1 + d2 + d3 = 2022. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal n by:

1. Considering possible divisor triples (d1,d2,d3) that sum to 2022
2. For each valid triple, computing the minimal n divisible by all three
3. Tracking the smallest such n found

We'll optimize by:
- Generating triples in order of increasing maximum divisor
- Stopping early when we can't find a smaller n
- Using GCD/LCM properties to compute minimal n

```python
import math
from itertools import combinations

def find_min_n():
    target = 2022
    min_n = float('inf')
    
    # Generate all possible triples (d1,d2,d3) with d1<d2<d3 and sum=2022
    for d1 in range(1, target//3 + 1):
        remaining = target - d1
        # d2 ranges between d1+1 and (remaining-1)//2 to ensure d2 < d3
        for d2 in range(d1 + 1, remaining//2 + 1):
            d3 = remaining - d2
            if d3 <= d2:
                continue
            # Compute minimal n divisible by d1,d2,d3 (their LCM)
            current_lcm = (d1 * d2) // math.gcd(d1, d2)
            current_lcm = (current_lcm * d3) // math.gcd(current_lcm, d3)
            
            if current_lcm < min_n:
                min_n = current_lcm
                print(f"New candidate: n={min_n} from divisors ({d1},{d2},{d3})")
    
    print(f"\nFinal minimal n found: {min_n}")

find_min_n()
