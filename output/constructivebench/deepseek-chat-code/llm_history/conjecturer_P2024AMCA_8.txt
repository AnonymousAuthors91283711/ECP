  Nat.card {θ : ℝ | 0 ≤ θ ∧ θ ≤ 2 * π ∧ log (sin (3 * θ)) + log (cos (2 * θ)) = 0} = P2024AMCA_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Total unique solutions found: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the problem statement and the enumerated answer showing 0 solutions, the correct answer is that there are no real θ values in [0, 2π] satisfying both the domain constraints and the equation. The logarithm terms impose strict domain requirements (sin(3θ) > 0 and cos(2θ) > 0), and their product must be 1, which appears impossible to satisfy simultaneously.
