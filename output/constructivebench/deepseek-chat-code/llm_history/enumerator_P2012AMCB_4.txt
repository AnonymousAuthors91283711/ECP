The problem involves calculating the percentage difference between Etienne's dollars (converted from euros) and Diana's dollars. We need to compute (EtienneDollars - DianaDollars)/DianaDollars * 100. The program will calculate this directly using the given conversion rate and amounts.

```python
# Calculate percentage difference between Etienne's dollars and Diana's dollars
euro_to_dollar = 1.3
diana_dollars = 500
etienne_euros = 400
etienne_dollars = etienne_euros * euro_to_dollar

percentage_diff = 100 * (etienne_dollars - diana_dollars) / diana_dollars
print(percentage_diff)
```
