[write_program]
This problem asks to find the real number x that satisfies the equation (2 + x + 10)/3 = x. We can solve this algebraically, but for demonstration purposes, we'll write a Python program that searches for the solution numerically.

The equation simplifies to (12 + x)/3 = x → 12 + x = 3x → 12 = 2x → x = 6. However, we'll implement a numerical approach that checks values around this solution to demonstrate how such problems can be approached computationally.

```python
def find_solution():
    # We'll search around the expected solution with small steps
    step = 0.1
    tolerance = 1e-10
    x = 5.0  # Start searching from x=5
    
    while x <= 7.0:  # Search in a reasonable range around expected solution
        left_side = (2 + x + 10) / 3
        right_side = x
        if abs(left_side - right_side) < tolerance:
            print(f"Found solution: x = {x}")
        x += step

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solution()
```
