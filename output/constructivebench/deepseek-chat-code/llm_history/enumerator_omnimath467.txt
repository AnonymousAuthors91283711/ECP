This problem asks for the smallest number n of linear conditions (a*x + b*y = 0) needed to characterize when x⁴ = x²y² for all real x,y. We'll enumerate possible n values and check if they satisfy the condition.

The key observation is that x⁴ = x²y² is equivalent to x²(x² - y²) = 0, which gives three cases:
1. x = 0
2. x = y
3. x = -y

We need to find the minimal number of linear conditions that capture exactly these cases.

```python
def check_condition(x, y, conditions):
    """Check if x,y satisfies any condition in the set."""
    for a, b in conditions:
        if abs(a * x + b * y) < 1e-10:  # account for floating point precision
            return True
    return False

def test_n(n):
    """Test if n conditions can capture x⁴ = x²y²."""
    # Try all combinations of n conditions (a,b)
    # We'll use symmetry and known solutions to limit the search space
    possible_conditions = [
        (1, 0),   # x = 0
        (1, -1),  # x = y
        (1, 1)    # x = -y
    ]
    
    from itertools import combinations
    for conds in combinations(possible_conditions, n):
        # Check all cases where x⁴ = x²y² should be true
        cases_true = [
            (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1), (2, 2), (2, -2)
        ]
        # Check cases where x⁴ ≠ x²y² should be false
        cases_false = [
            (1, 2), (1, 0.5), (2, 1), (2, -1)
        ]
        
        valid = True
        for x, y in cases_true:
            if not check_condition(x, y, conds):
                valid = False
                break
        if not valid:
            continue
            
        for x, y in cases_false:
            if check_condition(x, y, conds):
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            print(f"Found valid set with n={n}: {conds}")
            return True
    return False

# Search for minimal n
for n in range(1, 4):
    if test_n(n):
        print(f"Minimal n is {n}")
        break
```
