. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Looking at the pattern in the enumerated answers, we can observe that the denominators are perfect squares (1=1², 4=2², 9=3², etc.) and the numerators follow a more complex pattern. The final simplified result suggests the general form is a telescoping series that simplifies to a rational number with denominator (n+1)² when summed up to n. The exact closed form can be derived by partial fraction decomposition.

Final simplified result:

. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Looking at the enumerated answers, we can observe a pattern where each partial sum appears to be approaching 1 as n increases. The denominators are squares of consecutive integers, and the numerators seem to be following a telescoping pattern.

The proposed answer (1 : ℚ) - (1 / (14 + 1)^2) is close but not quite matching the final enumerated result. Based on the pattern, the correct closed form should be:

<<<(1 : ℚ) - (1 / (14 + 1)^2)>>>

However, the error message indicates a syntax issue with parentheses. The correct Lean syntax should be:

<<<(1 : ℚ) - (1 / (14 + 1)^2)>>>

This matches the telescoping pattern we observe in the partial sums, where each term in the series cancels out part of the previous term, leaving us with 1 minus the reciprocal of the square of the next integer after the range (which is 15 in this case, since we're summing up to i=13).

The pattern suggests that for a general n, the sum would be (1 : ℚ) - (1 / (n + 2)^2), but since the problem specifically asks for n=14 terms (Finset.range 14 gives i=0 to 13), we use 14+1=15 in the denominator.
