This problem involves finding the smallest natural number `n` such that for any 5-element subset `s` of {0,1,...,9}, the graph formed by complete graphs on `s` and its complement has at most `n` edges, and any two distinct vertices in `s` are connected by a path. We'll enumerate possible values of `n` by checking all 5-element subsets of {0,...,9}.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def solve():
    universe = set(range(10))
    max_edges = 0
    min_n = None
    
    # Check all 5-element subsets of {0,...,9}
    for s in combinations(range(10), 5):
        t = universe - set(s)
        
        # Calculate edges in complete graphs on s and t
        edges_s = len(list(combinations(s, 2)))
        edges_t = len(list(combinations(t, 2)))
        total_edges = edges_s + edges_t
        
        # Update maximum edges found
        if total_edges > max_edges:
            max_edges = total_edges
        
        # Check connectivity between all pairs in s
        connected = True
        for u, v in combinations(s, 2):
            # Direct edge exists since s forms a complete graph
            pass  # Always connected in complete graph
        
        # For this problem, since s is complete, connectivity is trivial
        # So we just need to track the maximum edge count
    
    # The minimal n is the maximum edge count found
    print(f"Maximum edges found: {max_edges}")
    print(f"Minimal required n: {max_edges}")

    solve()
