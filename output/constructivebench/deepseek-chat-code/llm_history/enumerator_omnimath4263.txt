[write_program]
This problem asks for natural numbers n where there's exactly one integer a in [0, n!) such that n! divides aⁿ + 1. We'll write a Python program to find such n by checking each candidate a for small n values.

The approach:
1. Iterate n from 1 upwards
2. For each n, compute n!
3. Check all integers a from 0 to n!-1
4. Count how many a satisfy n! divides aⁿ + 1
5. Print n when exactly one such a exists

```python
import math

def find_unique_n():
    max_n = 10  # Reasonable upper bound for demonstration
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        factorial_n = math.factorial(n)
        count = 0
        last_valid_a = None
        for a in range(factorial_n):
            # Compute a^n + 1 modulo n!
            # Using pow with modulus for efficiency
            remainder = (pow(a, n, factorial_n) + 1) % factorial_n
            if remainder == 0:
                count += 1
                last_valid_a = a
                if count > 1:
                    break  # Early exit if multiple solutions
        
        if count == 1:
            print(f"n={n} has unique solution a={last_valid_a}")

find_unique_n()
```
