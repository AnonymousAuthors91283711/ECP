This problem involves finding the value of an expression given certain conditions on x and y. The condition is x + y = 5*(x - y) with x,y > 0. We'll solve for y in terms of x, then compute the expression (x^2 + y^2)/(x*y) which is likely what P2015AMCA_4_answer represents.

The program will:
1. Solve the equation x + y = 5*(x - y) symbolically to find the relationship between x and y
2. Substitute this relationship into (x^2 + y^2)/(x*y) and simplify
3. Verify the result is always 3/2 regardless of x (as long as x,y > 0)

```python
def solve_problem():
    # From x + y = 5*(x - y), we can derive y = (2/3)x
    # Then compute (x^2 + y^2)/(x*y) = (x^2 + (4/9)x^2)/(x*(2/3)x) = (13/9)/(2/3) = 13/6
    # Wait, this contradicts the theorem's claim of 3/2. Let me re-examine:
    
    # Correct derivation:
    # x + y = 5x - 5y
    # 6y = 4x
    # y = (2/3)x
    
    # Now compute (x^2 + y^2)/(x*y):
    numerator = x**2 + y**2
    denominator = x * y
    ratio = numerator / denominator
    
    # Substitute y = (2/3)x:
    x_val = 3  # arbitrary positive value
    y_val = (2/3) * x_val
    actual_ratio = (x_val**2 + y_val**2) / (x_val * y_val)
    
    print(f"For x = {x_val}, y = {y_val}: ratio = {actual_ratio}")
    
    # The result should simplify to 3/2 = 1.5
    # Let's verify with exact fractions:
    from fractions import Fraction
    x_frac = Fraction(3)
    y_frac = Fraction(2,3) * x_frac
    num_frac = x_frac**2 + y_frac**2
    denom_frac = x_frac * y_frac
    ratio_frac = num_frac / denom_frac
    print(f"Exact fraction result: {ratio_frac}")

Judgement:
1. The problem asks to verify that (x² + y²)/(xy) = 3/2 under given conditions, but the program's mathematical derivation is incorrect.
2. The program correctly derives y = (2/3)x from the equation, but then miscalculates the ratio as 13/6 instead of 13/6 (which is actually correct, contradicting the theorem's claim of 3/2).
3. The program doesn't actually output any answers (the print statements are commented out in the original).
4. The theorem's claim of 3/2 appears incorrect based on the algebraic derivation.

The program should be rejected because:
- It doesn't output any results (empty output)
- Contains incorrect mathematical reasoning (though the calculation is actually correct, contradicting the theorem)
- Doesn't properly verify the theorem's claim
