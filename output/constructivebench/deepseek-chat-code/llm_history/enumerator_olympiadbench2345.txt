This problem involves finding the sum x + y given a constraint involving x and y. The constraint is a rational equation that can be simplified. We'll approach it by parameterizing the variables to find possible solutions.

The key steps are:
1. Let a = x - 2013 and b = y - 2014 to simplify the equation
2. The equation becomes (a*b)/(a² + b²) = -1/2
3. Solve for the relationship between a and b
4. Find all real pairs (a,b) satisfying this equation
5. Convert back to x and y to find x + y

We'll enumerate possible rational solutions for (a,b) and compute x + y for each case.

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def find_solutions():
    # We'll search for small integer solutions to a*b/(a^2 + b^2) = -1/2
    # Which is equivalent to 2ab = -a^2 - b^2 => a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 0 => (a + b)^2 = 0
    # So a = -b is the only real solution
    
    # Parameterize a = t, b = -t
    # The original equation becomes (t*(-t))/(t^2 + (-t)^2) = -t^2/(2t^2) = -1/2
    # Which satisfies the equation for all t ≠ 0
    
    # Therefore, the general solution is x = 2013 + t, y = 2014 - t
    # So x + y = 2013 + 2014 + t - t = 4027
    
    # To demonstrate this programmatically, we'll show several examples:
    for t in range(-5, 6):
        if t == 0:
            continue  # t=0 makes denominator zero
        x = 2013 + t
        y = 2014 - t
        sum_xy = x + y
        print(f"For t={t}: x={x}, y={y}, x+y={sum_xy}")
    
    # All cases give the same sum
    print("All valid solutions satisfy x + y = 4027")
