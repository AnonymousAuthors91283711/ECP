This problem involves finding the value of a*x^5 + b*y^5 given a system of equations with powers of x and y. We can approach this by recognizing it as a linear recurrence relation problem. The solution involves finding a recurrence relation that connects consecutive terms.

We'll implement a program to:
1. Assume the recurrence relation is of order 2 (since we have two variables x and y)
2. Find coefficients p and q such that Sₙ = p*Sₙ₋₁ + q*Sₙ₋₂
3. Use the given values to solve for p and q
4. Compute S₅ using the recurrence relation

```python
def solve():
    # Given values
    S0 = 2  # a*x^0 + b*y^0 = a + b (not given, but we can assume it's 2 based on pattern)
    S1 = 3  # a*x + b*y
    S2 = 7  # a*x^2 + b*y^2
    S3 = 16
    S4 = 42
    
    # Solve for p and q in the recurrence relation S_n = p*S_{n-1} + q*S_{n-2}
    # Using S2 = p*S1 + q*S0 and S3 = p*S2 + q*S1
    # We get two equations:
    # 7 = 3p + 2q
    # 16 = 7p + 3q
    
    # Solving the system of equations
    # From first equation: q = (7 - 3p)/2
    # Substitute into second equation: 16 = 7p + 3*(7-3p)/2
    # Multiply both sides by 2: 32 = 14p + 21 - 9p
    # Simplify: 11 = 5p => p = 11/5
    # Then q = (7 - 3*(11/5))/2 = (35/5 - 33/5)/2 = (2/5)/2 = 1/5
    
    p = 11/5
    q = 1/5
    
    # Compute S5 using the recurrence relation
    S5 = p*S4 + q*S3
    print(S5)
