[write_program]
This problem involves finding the sum `a + b` given certain conditions about quadratic equations and midpoints. The conditions imply that two distinct points lie on both a line `y = a*x + b` and a parabola `y = x^2`, and the midpoint of these two points is (5, 101). We'll write a Python program to find possible values of `a` and `b` that satisfy these conditions.

The approach is:
1. Let the two x-coordinates be `5 - d` and `5 + d` (since their average is 5)
2. Their y-coordinates will be `(5-d)^2` and `(5+d)^2` (since they lie on y=x²)
3. The average y-coordinate must be 101
4. Solve for d, then find a and b using the line equation

```python
def solve_problem():
    # The midpoint x-coordinate is 5, so let x1 = 5 - d, x2 = 5 + d
    # The midpoint y-coordinate is 101, so (y1 + y2)/2 = 101
    # Since y1 = x1^2 and y2 = x2^2, we have:
    # [(5-d)^2 + (5+d)^2]/2 = 101
    # Expand and simplify:
    # [25 - 10d + d² + 25 + 10d + d²]/2 = 101
    # (50 + 2d²)/2 = 101
    # 25 + d² = 101
    # d² = 76
    # d = ±√76 = ±2√19
    
    from math import sqrt
    
    d_squared = 76
    d = sqrt(d_squared)
    
    # Two possible d values (positive and negative, but they give same results)
    x1 = 5 - d
    x2 = 5 + d
    
    # Now find a and b such that both points lie on y = a*x + b
    # We have two equations:
    # a*x1 + b = x1^2
    # a*x2 + b = x2^2
    # Subtract first from second:
    # a*(x2 - x1) = x2^2 - x1^2
    # a = (x2^2 - x1^2)/(x2 - x1) = x1 + x2 (difference of squares)
    a = x1 + x2
    b = x1**2 - a*x1
    
    # Calculate a + b
    result = a + b
    
    # Output the exact form (a + b simplifies to x1^2 + x2^2 - x1*x2 - x1^2 = x2^2 - x1*x2)
    # But we can compute it numerically first
    print(f"Numerical result: {result}")
    
    # For exact form, notice:
    # a + b = (x1 + x2) + (x1^2 - (x1 + x2)*x1)
    # = x1 + x2 + x1^2 - x1^2 - x1*x2
    # = x1 + x2 - x1*x2
    # x1*x2 = (5-d)(5+d) = 25 - d^2 = 25 - 76 = -51
    # So a + b = 10 - (-51) = 61 (since x1 + x2 = 10)
    print("Exact result: 61")
