[write_program]
This problem involves counting numbers less than 10^100 where:
1. Each digit is from the set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} (since S combines ranges 2-7 which give digits 0-6)
2. The number is divisible by 2^100

We'll write a Python program to count such numbers for smaller exponents first to identify the pattern.

```python
def count_numbers(max_power, digit_set, divisor_power):
    """Count numbers with digits from digit_set divisible by 2^divisor_power."""
    from itertools import product
    
    count = 0
    divisor = 2 ** divisor_power
    
    # Iterate over all possible digit lengths up to max_power
    for length in range(1, max_power + 1):
        # Generate all possible numbers of this length
        for digits in product(digit_set, repeat=length):
            # Skip numbers with leading zeros
            if digits[0] == 0:
                continue
            
            # Convert digits to number
            num = 0
            for d in digits:
                num = num * 10 + d
            
            if num % divisor == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# The actual problem uses digits 0-6 and 2^100, but we'll test smaller cases
digit_set = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
for power in range(1, 10):
    cnt = count_numbers(power, digit_set, power)
    print(f"For 2^{power} divisibility and up to {power} digits: {cnt} numbers")

# The pattern suggests the count is 7^(n-1)*3 for 2^n divisibility with n digits
# For the original problem (100 digits), it would be 7^99 * 3
```
