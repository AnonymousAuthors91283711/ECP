Ground Truth Answer: -2010012 / 2010013
Proposed Answer: -(1 - 1/2004002)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

The ground truth answer is -2010012/2010013, which can be rewritten as:
-(2010012/2010013)

The proposed answer is -(1 - 1/2004002), which simplifies to:
-1 + 1/2004002

Now let's compare the numerical values:
- Ground truth: -2010012/2010013 ≈ -0.9999995025
- Proposed: -1 + 1/2004002 ≈ -1 + 0.0000004990 ≈ -0.9999995010

While these values are numerically very close, they are not mathematically equivalent expressions. The ground truth answer is exact, while the proposed answer is an approximation that's very close but not identical.
