The problem involves solving a logarithmic equation where we need to find all x > 256² that satisfy the given equation. The equation relates nested logarithms with different bases (256 and 256²). We'll write a program to explore potential solutions by testing values and transformations.

Key observations:
1. The equation involves triple-nested logarithms with base 256 on the left and base 256² on the right
2. We need to find x > 256² (65536) that satisfies the equation
3. The solution likely involves exponential relationships due to the logarithmic nature

We'll test powers of 256 to find potential solutions, as these simplify the logarithmic expressions.

```python
import math

def logb(b, x):
    return math.log(x) / math.log(b)

def test_x(x):
    left = logb(256, logb(256, logb(256, x)))
    right = logb(256**2, logb(256**2, logb(256**2, x)))
    return abs(left - right) < 1e-10

# Test powers of 256 that would make the nested logs simplify
base = 256
for k in range(1, 10):
    # Try x = 256^(256^k)
    x = base ** (base ** k)
    if test_x(x):
        print(f"Found candidate x = 256^(256^{k})")

    # Try x = 256^(256^(256^k))
    x = base ** (base ** (base ** k))
    if test_x(x):
        print(f"Found candidate x = 256^(256^(256^{k}))")

# Also test intermediate values between powers
for e in [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128]:
    x = base ** e
    if x > base**2 and test_x(x):
        print(f"Found candidate x = 256^{e}")
```
