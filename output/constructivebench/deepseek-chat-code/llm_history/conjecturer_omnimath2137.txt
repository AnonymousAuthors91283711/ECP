. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<3 * 2013 - 4^(digits 4 2013).length>>> 

Explanation: The pattern shows the sum grows linearly with 3n, minus adjustments for numbers with more digits. The adjustment term accounts for the base-4 digit length of n. For n=2013 (digits4(2013).length=6), this gives 3*2013-4^6=6039-4096=1943, which matches the final sum when added to the base sum of 3*2013.
