[write_program]
This problem involves a double infinite sum with a custom function Ω(n,k) that counts prime factors of n+1 that are ≥ k+1. The goal is to approximate the sum to within 1/2 of some unknown answer. We'll write a Python program to compute partial sums of this series to help conjecture the true value.

The approach will be:
1. Implement prime factorization
2. Implement the Ω function
3. Compute partial sums by truncating the infinite series at increasing limits
4. Print partial results to observe convergence

```python
import math

def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n = n // 2
    i = 3
    while i * i <= n:
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n = n // i
        i += 2
    if n > 2:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors

def omega(n, k):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    factors = prime_factors(n)
    return sum(1 for p in factors if p >= k)

def compute_partial_sum(N_max, K_max):
    total = 0.0
    for n in range(N_max + 1):
        for k in range(K_max + 1):
            if n + k >= 6:  # Avoid negative exponents
                term = omega(n + 1, k + 1) / (3 ** (n + k - 6))
                total += term
    return total

# Compute partial sums with increasing limits
for limit in [5, 10, 15, 20]:
    s = compute_partial_sum(limit, limit)
    print(f"Partial sum up to n,k={limit}: {s:.10f}")
```

The program computes partial sums of the series by:
1. Implementing prime factorization to support the Ω function
2. Calculating Ω(n+1,k+1) as the count of prime factors ≥ k+1 in n+1
3. Summing terms up to increasing limits N_max and K_max
4. Printing partial results to observe convergence

The output shows how the sum stabilizes as we increase the limits, helping conjecture the true value of the infinite series. The exact value would require mathematical proof, but the numerical evidence can guide the conjecture.
