[write_program]
This problem involves finding the number of subsets of the first 15 Fibonacci numbers (starting from F₂) where the sum of the selected numbers equals the sum of the non-selected numbers. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such subsets for small Fibonacci sequences first, then extend to 15 elements.

The approach:
1. Generate the first 17 Fibonacci numbers (F₀ to F₁₆)
2. Take the slice from F₂ to F₁₆ (15 elements)
3. Use dynamic programming to count subsets with sum equal to half the total sum
4. Only proceed if total sum is even (otherwise no solution exists)

```python
def main():
    # Generate Fibonacci numbers F0 to F16
    fib = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 17):
        fib.append(fib[i-1] + fib[i-2])
    
    # Take w = [F2, F3, ..., F16] (15 elements)
    w = fib[2:17]
    total = sum(w)
    
    if total % 2 != 0:
        print("No solutions exist (total sum is odd)")
        return
    
    target = total // 2
    n = len(w)
    
    # DP table: dp[i][s] = number of ways to sum s using first i elements
    dp = [{} for _ in range(n+1)]
    dp[0][0] = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        num = w[i-1]
        for s in dp[i-1]:
            # Option 1: don't take w[i-1]
            if s in dp[i]:
                dp[i][s] += dp[i-1][s]
            else:
                dp[i][s] = dp[i-1][s]
            # Option 2: take w[i-1]
            new_s = s + num
            if new_s in dp[i]:
                dp[i][new_s] += dp[i-1][s]
            else:
                dp[i][new_s] = dp[i-1][s]
    
    print(f"Number of valid subsets: {dp[n].get(target, 0)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
