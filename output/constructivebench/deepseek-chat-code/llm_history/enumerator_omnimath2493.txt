This problem involves counting the number of weakly increasing functions from Fin 10 to Fin 9 where the image has at most 3 distinct values. We'll approach this by enumerating all possible combinations of 1, 2, or 3 distinct values and counting the valid weakly increasing sequences for each case.

The solution involves:
1. Considering cases for 1, 2, or 3 distinct values in the image
2. For each case, generating all possible combinations of values
3. Counting the number of weakly increasing sequences that can be formed with those values

```python
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement

def count_sequences(n, k, max_distinct):
    total = 0
    for d in range(1, max_distinct + 1):
        # Generate all combinations of d distinct values in 1..k
        for values in combinations_with_replacement(range(1, k + 1), d):
            # Convert to list and remove duplicates to get distinct values
            distinct_values = sorted(list(set(values)))
            if len(distinct_values) != d:
                continue
            
            # Count weakly increasing sequences with values from distinct_values
            # This is equivalent to combinations with repetition: C(n + d - 1, d - 1)
            from math import comb
            count = comb(n + d - 1, d - 1)
            total += count
    return total

# Parameters: n=10 elements, k=9 possible values, at most 3 distinct values
n = 10
k = 9
max_distinct = 3

# Calculate and print the result
result = count_sequences(n, k, max_distinct)
print(result)
```
