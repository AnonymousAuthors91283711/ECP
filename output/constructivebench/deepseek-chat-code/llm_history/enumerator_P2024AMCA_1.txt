[write_program]
The problem asks to compute the value of the expression `9901 * 101 - 99 * 10101`. We can write a Python program to compute this directly since it's a straightforward arithmetic expression. The program will calculate and print the result.

```python
# Compute 9901 * 101 - 99 * 10101
result = 9901 * 101 - 99 * 10101
print(result)
```
