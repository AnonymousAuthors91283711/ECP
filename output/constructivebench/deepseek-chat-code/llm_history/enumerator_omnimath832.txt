[write_program]
This problem involves two recursive sequences (squirrel and rabbit) and asks to find the smallest positive integer y where rabbit(y) > squirrel(y). We'll write a Python program to compute both sequences and find this minimal y.

The approach:
1. Implement both recursive sequences exactly
2. Compute terms until we find the first y where rabbit(y) > squirrel(y)
3. Since the sequences grow exponentially, we'll stop at a reasonable threshold (y=20) to prevent infinite loops

```python
def compute_sequences(max_y=20):
    # Initialize sequences with y=0 values
    squirrel = [1]
    rabbit = [1]
    
    for y in range(1, max_y + 1):
        # Compute next terms using the recursive definitions
        next_squirrel = 2 * squirrel[y-1] + 2019
        next_rabbit = 4 * rabbit[y-1] - 2
        
        squirrel.append(next_squirrel)
        rabbit.append(next_rabbit)
        
        # Check if rabbit > squirrel for current y
        if next_rabbit > next_squirrel:
            print(f"Found y = {y}: rabbit({y}) = {next_rabbit}, squirrel({y}) = {next_squirrel}")
            return y  # Return first occurrence
    
    print(f"No solution found up to y = {max_y}")
    return None

# Execute the computation
minimal_y = compute_sequences()
if minimal_y is not None:
    print(f"The minimal positive y is: {minimal_y}")
```
