This problem involves counting subsets of size 5 from a 9-element set (Fin 9) with certain constraints. The constraints are:
1. Either contains both 0 and 1, or contains neither
2. Contains neither 2 nor 3
3. Has exactly 5 elements

We'll enumerate all possible 5-element subsets of {0,1,...,8} that satisfy these constraints. The approach is:
1. Generate all combinations of 5 elements from 9
2. Filter those that meet the conditions
3. Count the valid combinations

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_valid(C):
    # Condition 1: contains both 0 and 1, or neither
    cond1 = ((0 in C and 1 in C) or (0 not in C and 1 not in C))
    # Condition 2: contains neither 2 nor 3
    cond2 = (2 not in C) and (3 not in C)
    return cond1 and cond2

def count_valid_subsets():
    universe = range(9)  # Fin 9 = {0,1,...,8}
    count = 0
    for C in combinations(universe, 5):
        if is_valid(C):
            count += 1
            print(C)  # Print each valid subset
    print("Total count:", count)

count_valid_subsets()
```
