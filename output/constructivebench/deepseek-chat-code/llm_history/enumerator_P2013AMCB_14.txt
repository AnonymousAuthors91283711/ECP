[write_program]
This problem involves finding the smallest number N that appears in both a 6th term of sequence A (defined by a₁, a₂) and sequence B (defined by b₁, b₂), where a₁ < b₁. The sequences are Fibonacci-like with recurrence relation f(n+2) = f(n+1) + f(n).

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Generate all possible 6th terms for sequence A with small a₁, a₂ values
2. For each N from sequence A, check if it can be generated by sequence B with b₁ > a₁
3. Find the smallest such N

```python
def sequence(a1, a2, n):
    """Compute nth term of the sequence starting with a1, a2"""
    if n == 0:
        return a1
    if n == 1:
        return a2
    prev_prev, prev = a1, a2
    for _ in range(2, n+1):
        current = prev + prev_prev
        prev_prev, prev = prev, current
    return prev

def find_min_common_N(max_a1=10, max_a2=20):
    """Find minimal N that appears in both sequences with a1 < b1"""
    # First collect all possible N from sequence A
    a_results = {}
    for a1 in range(1, max_a1):
        for a2 in range(1, max_a2):
            N = sequence(a1, a2, 6)
            if N not in a_results or a1 < a_results[N][0]:
                a_results[N] = (a1, a2)
    
    # Check each N from sequence A against possible sequence B
    min_N = None
    for N in sorted(a_results.keys()):
        a1, a2 = a_results[N]
        # Check if exists b1 > a1 and b2 that gives same N at 6th term
        found = False
        for b1 in range(a1 + 1, max_a1 + 5):
            for b2 in range(1, max_a2 + 5):
                if sequence(b1, b2, 6) == N:
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if found:
            if min_N is None or N < min_N:
                min_N = N
                print(f"Found candidate: N={N} from a1={a1}, a2={a2}")
    
    if min_N is not None:
        print(f"Minimum N found: {min_N}")
    else:
        print("No solution found with current parameters")

find_min_common_N()
