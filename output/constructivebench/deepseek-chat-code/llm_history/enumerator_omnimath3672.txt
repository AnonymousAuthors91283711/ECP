This problem involves finding all real-valued functions f: ℝ → ℝ that satisfy a given functional equation. To approach this, we'll enumerate simple function forms (linear, constant, etc.) and check if they satisfy the equation. We'll test small integer coefficients for linear functions and common constant values.

```python
def check_function(a, b):
    """Check if f(x) = a*x + b satisfies the functional equation."""
    # The functional equation is:
    # f(x*f(y) + y) + f(-f(x)) = f(y*f(x) - y) + y
    # Substitute f(x) = a*x + b into the equation
    # Left side: f(x*f(y) + y) + f(-f(x)) = a*(x*(a*y + b) + y) + b + a*(-(a*x + b)) + b
    # Right side: f(y*f(x) - y) + y = a*(y*(a*x + b) - y) + b + y
    
    # Simplify both sides
    left = a*(x*(a*y + b) + y) + b + a*(-(a*x + b)) + b
    right = a*(y*(a*x + b) - y) + b + y
    
    # Expand and simplify
    left = a**2*x*y + a*b*x + a*y + b - a**2*x - a*b + b
    right = a**2*x*y + a*b*y - a*y + b + y
    
    # Collect terms
    left = a**2*x*y + a*b*x + a*y - a**2*x - a*b + 2*b
    right = a**2*x*y + a*b*y - a*y + b + y
    
    # Subtract right from left
    diff = (left - right).simplify()
    
    # The equation must hold for all x,y, so coefficients must be zero
    # Collect coefficients of x*y, x, y, and constants
    coeff_xy = a**2 - a**2  # Always 0
    coeff_x = a*b - a**2
    coeff_y = a - (a*b - a + 1)
    const = -a*b + 2*b - b
    
    # Solve the system
    solutions = []
    if coeff_x == 0 and coeff_y == 0 and const == 0:
        return True
    return False

# Test constant functions (a=0)
for b in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    if check_function(0, b):
        print(f"Constant function f(x) = {b}")

# Test linear functions with small integer coefficients
for a in [-2, -1, 1, 2]:
    for b in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
        if check_function(a, b):
            print(f"Linear function f(x) = {a}x + {b}")

# Special case: check identity function (a=1, b=0)
if check_function(1, 0):
    print("Identity function f(x) = x")

# Check if zero function is a solution (a=0, b=0)
if check_function(0, 0):
    print("Zero function f(x) = 0")
```
[refine_program]
Let me analyze this problem and the program:

1. Problem Analysis:
- We're looking for all real-valued functions f: ℝ → ℝ that satisfy a specific functional equation.
- The equation is: f(x*f(y) + y) + f(-f(x)) = f(y*f(x) - y) + y for all x,y ∈ ℝ
- The program tests linear functions of form f(x) = a*x + b

2. Program Analysis:
- The program correctly implements the functional equation check for linear functions.
- It tests constant functions (a=0) and linear functions with small integer coefficients.
- The program structure follows requirements: streaming results, no hardcoding, etc.
- However, it finds no solutions, which suggests either:
  a) There are no linear solutions (unlikely)
  b) The coefficient checking is incorrect

3. Issue Found:
- The main problem is in the coefficient checking logic. The program simplifies the difference but doesn't properly solve the system of equations.
- The conditions `coeff_x == 0 and coeff_y == 0 and const == 0` are never satisfied because the coefficient extraction is incorrect.

4. Solution:
- We should properly solve the system of equations that results from setting all coefficients to zero.
- For linear functions, this leads to two possible solutions: f(x) = x and f(x) = -x.

Judgement: <<<False>>>

Here's the corrected program:

```python
def check_function(a, b):
    """Check if f(x) = a*x + b satisfies the functional equation."""
    # The functional equation is:
    # f(x*f(y) + y) + f(-f(x)) = f(y*f(x) - y) + y
    # Substitute f(x) = a*x + b into the equation
    
    # After substitution and simplification, we get:
    # For the equation to hold for all x,y, the coefficients must satisfy:
    # (1) a² - a² = 0 (always true)
    # (2) a*b - a² = 0
    # (3) a - a*b + a - 1 = 0 => 2a - a*b - 1 = 0
    # (4) -a*b + b = 0
    
    # Solve the system:
    # From (4): b*(1 - a) = 0

Explanation:
The problem is a functional equation in real-valued functions, asking to find all functions f: ℝ → ℝ that satisfy the given equation for all real x, y. The original submission is empty, providing no program or enumerated answers, which is clearly insufficient.

Since this is a functional equation problem, we need to systematically test common function forms (linear, quadratic, etc.) to see which ones satisfy the equation. The most efficient approach is to:
1. Test linear functions f(x) = ax + b first since they're simplest
2. Verify if they satisfy the equation for all x,y
3. Print any valid solutions found

The program should output candidate functions that satisfy the equation when tested with sample values, and we can then verify if they hold generally.

<<<False>>>

```python
def test_function(a, b):
    """Test if f(x) = a*x + b satisfies the functional equation."""
    # We'll test with specific x,y values to check if the equation holds
    test_cases = [(1,1), (1,0), (0,1), (2,3), (-1,2)]
    for x, y in test_cases:
        left = a*(x*(a*y + b) + y) + b + a*(-(a*x + b)) + b
        right = a*(y*(a*x + b) - y) + b + y
        if not abs(left - right) < 1e-6:  # Account for floating point precision
            return False
    return True

# Search for linear solutions f(x) = a*x + b
print("Searching for linear solutions f(x) = a*x + b:")
found = False
for a in [-1, 0, 1, 2]:  # Test common coefficients
    for b in [-1, 0, 1, 2]:
        if test_function(a, b):
            print(f"Found candidate: f(x) = {a}x + {b}")
            found = True

if not found:
    print("No linear solutions found")
else:
    print("Note: Candidates should be verified for all x,y")
```
