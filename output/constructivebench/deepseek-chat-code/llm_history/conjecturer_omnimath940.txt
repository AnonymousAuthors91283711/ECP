. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern, the sequence appears to be related to the largest prime factor of n plus 1. For prime numbers, a(n) = 2 (since gcd(a(n-1),n) = 1 for primes). For composite numbers, it increases with the largest prime factor. The answer for a(2002) would be the largest prime factor of 2002 plus 1. 2002 = 2 × 7 × 11 × 13, so largest prime factor is 13.
