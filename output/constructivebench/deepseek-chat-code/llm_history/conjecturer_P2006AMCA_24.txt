abbrev P2006AMCA_24_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2006AMCA_24 : 
  let S := { (a, b, c) : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ | a + b + c = 2006 ∧ (b + c) % 2 = 0 }
  Nat.card S = P2006AMCA_24_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=6: 4
n=8: 9
n=10: 16
n=12: 25
For n=2006, the count would be 1006009. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern from the enumerated answers:
- For n=6 (2006/334≈6), count is 4 (2²)
- For n=8, count is 9 (3²)
- For n=10, count is 16 (4²)
- For n=12, count is 25 (5²)
The pattern suggests the count is ((n/2) - 1)². For n=2006, this gives (1003-1)² = 1006009.

<<<((2006 / 2) - 1)^2>>>
