theorem omnimath2256 :
  let n := 21
  let alice := 11
  let expectedGames := (∑ k in Finset.range (alice - 1), 1/(k + 1 : ℚ)) + (∑ k in Finset.range (n - alice), 1/(k + 1 : ℚ))

Ground Truth Answer: 47/42
Proposed Answer: 7381/1260
Let's analyze both answers carefully:

1. The ground truth answer is 47/42 ≈ 1.119047619
2. The proposed answer is 7381/1260 ≈ 5.857936508

The two answers are numerically very different (5.857 vs 1.119). 

Calculating the expected value manually:
For n=21 and alice=11, we have two harmonic series sums:
- First sum (k=0 to 10): H_11
- Second sum (k=0 to 10): H_11 (since n-alice=10)

But wait, the second sum should be k=0 to 9 (since n-alice=10, range gives 0-9), so H_10.

Total would be H_11 + H_10 = 83711/27720 ≈ 3.019877345

Neither answer matches this calculation, but the proposed answer is much closer to this value than the ground truth answer. However, neither matches our manual calculation, and they don't match each other.
