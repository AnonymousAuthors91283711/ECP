[write_program]
This problem defines a strictly increasing function f: ℕ → ℕ with specific recursive properties. We need to compute f(137). The function is defined by:
- f(1) = 1
- For any n, f(2n)*f(2n+1) = 9*f(n)² + 3*f(n)

We'll write a Python program to compute f(n) for small values and look for patterns, then compute f(137).

```python
def compute_f(max_n):
    f = {1: 1}
    for n in range(1, (max_n + 1) // 2 + 1):
        # Compute f(2n) and f(2n+1) based on f(n)
        fn = f[n]
        product = 9 * fn * fn + 3 * fn
        
        # Find consecutive integers a, a+1 whose product equals 'product'
        # Solve a*(a+1) = product => a² + a - product = 0
        discriminant = 1 + 4 * product
        sqrt_discriminant = int(discriminant ** 0.5)
        if sqrt_discriminant * sqrt_discriminant != discriminant:
            print(f"Error: No solution for n={n}")
            return None
        
        a = (-1 + sqrt_discriminant) // 2
        if a * (a + 1) != product:
            print(f"Error: Invalid solution for n={n}")
            return None
        
        # Since f is strictly increasing, assign the smaller value to f(2n)
        f[2*n] = a
        f[2*n + 1] = a + 1
        
        # Print computed values
        print(f"f({2*n}) = {a}, f({2*n + 1}) = {a + 1}")
    
    return f

max_n = 137
f = compute_f(max_n)
if f is not None and max_n in f:
    print(f"\nf({max_n}) = {f[max_n]}")
else:
    print(f"\nCould not compute f({max_n})")
```
