Looking at the problem and the enumerated answers, we need to find the greatest integer n such that n² = (m+1)³ - m³ for some integer m. The equation simplifies to n² = 3m² + 3m + 1.

The error in the proposed answer occurs because we need to provide a specific integer value (the greatest n) rather than a function. From the enumerated answers, we see the maximum n is 489061 when m = 282359.

The correct answer should be the largest n value found, which is 489061. The function form was incorrect because the problem asks for a specific value, not a general formula.

<<<489061>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks for the greatest integer n satisfying n² = (m+1)³ - m³ for some m. The enumerated solutions show the maximum n is 489061 (when m=282359). The original attempt provided a function instead of the required specific value. The correct answer is simply this maximum n value.
