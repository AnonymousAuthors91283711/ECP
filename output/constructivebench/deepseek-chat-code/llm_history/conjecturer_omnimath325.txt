<<<166>>> 

Explanation: The problem seeks the smallest positive integer N where a polynomial condition holds. The enumerated search suggests N=166 is the minimal solution, as it satisfies the divisibility condition for X² + X + 1 when all divisors d of N have p(d)=1 and non-divisors have p(d)=0. The polynomial evaluates to 166 - sum of X^d for d∣166.
