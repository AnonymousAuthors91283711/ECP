This problem involves a recurrence relation with trigonometric properties. We'll compute the sequence values numerically to identify a pattern. The recurrence suggests periodicity or trigonometric behavior.

```python
import math

def compute_sequence(n_max):
    a = [0.0] * (n_max + 2)
    a[1] = 1.0
    a[2] = 1.0 / math.sqrt(3)
    
    for n in range(1, n_max):
        a[n+2] = a[n+1]**2 - a[n]
    
    # Print first 20 terms to observe pattern
    print("First 20 terms of the sequence:")
    for i in range(1, 21):
        print(f"a[{i}] = {a[i]:.6f}")
    
    # Print specific terms near 2009 to check periodicity
    print("\nTerms around 2009:")
    for i in range(2005, 2015):
        print(f"a[{i}] = {a[i]:.6f}")

# Compute up to 2015 terms to observe behavior
compute_sequence(2015)
```

Judgement:
The original program is rejected because:
1. It doesn't follow the problem requirements - it doesn't output the required answer for |a 2009|
2. It prints diagnostic information (first 20 terms and terms around 2009) instead of solving the problem
3. It doesn't demonstrate any pattern recognition or conclusion about the sequence's behavior
4. The output is empty for the actual answer we need

The sequence appears to be periodic with period 6, which can be verified by computing more terms. We should compute the sequence up to at least 2009 terms and output |a[2009]|.

<<<False>>>

```python
import math

def compute_sequence():
    # Initialize sequence with enough terms
    n_max = 2010
    a = [0.0] * (n_max + 2)
    a[1] = 1.0
    a[2] = 1.0 / math.sqrt(3)
    
    # Compute sequence up to 2009
    for n in range(1, n_max):
        a[n+2] = a[n+1]**2 - a[n]
    
    # The sequence is periodic with period 6, so we can compute a[2009] as a[2009 % 6]
    # But we'll compute it directly to be sure
    result = abs(a[2009])
    print(f"{result:.6f}")

Judgement Explanation:
1. The problem involves computing a recursive sequence and finding the absolute value of the 2009th term.
2. The original program correctly implements the recursive formula and computes up to the required term.
3. However, the program doesn't actually output anything (the "Enumerated Answers" shows empty result), which violates requirement #1 about streaming partial results.
4. The program should print intermediate results to show progress and the final answer.
5. The sequence appears to be periodic, but the program doesn't take advantage of this for efficiency.
6. The floating-point precision might not be sufficient for exact values, but the problem allows approximations.

The program is rejected because it fails to output any results despite computing them.

def compute_sequence():
    # Initialize sequence with enough terms
    n_max = 2009
    a = [0.0] * (n_max + 2)
    a[1] = 1.0
    a[2] = 1.0 / math.sqrt(3)
    
    # Print initial terms
    print(f"a[1] = {a[1]:.6f}")
    print(f"a[2] = {a[2]:.6f}")
    
    # Compute sequence up to 2009 and print every 100 terms
    for n in range(1, n_max):
        a[n+2] = a[n+1]**2 - a[n]
        if (n+2) % 100 == 0 or n+2 == n_max:
            print(f"a[{n+2}] = {a[n+2]:.6f}")
    
    # Final answer
    result = abs(a[2009])
    print(f"\nFinal answer: |a[2009]| = {result:.6f}")
