Enumerated even candidates up to 100. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
From the problem statement and enumerated answers, we can observe:
1. The function must return an even number when n=7
2. The specific value isn't constrained beyond being even
3. The simplest consistent solution is a function that always returns the smallest even number (0)

<<<fun _ : ℕ => 0>>>
