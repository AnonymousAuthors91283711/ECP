Found threshold: 6455. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern in the enumerated answers, we can see that the numbers follow a specific structure:
- For N < 5000: Numbers are of form X44 where X ranges from 5 to 9
- For N ≥ 5000: Numbers are of form 5Y44 where Y ranges from 0 to 4

The threshold where exactly 2011 numbers satisfy the condition appears to be just before 6455. The pattern suggests numbers where doubling them adds exactly one digit, which typically occurs when the number is just below a power of 5 (since 5*2=10).
