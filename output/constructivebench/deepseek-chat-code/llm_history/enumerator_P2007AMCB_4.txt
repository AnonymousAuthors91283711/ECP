This problem involves finding rational numbers w, b, r that satisfy three equations: their sum is 1, the ratio w/b is 16/3, and the ratio b/r is 3/1. We need to find the value of w.

We'll solve this by:
1. Expressing all variables in terms of r using the given ratios
2. Substituting into the sum equation to find r
3. Calculating w from r

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve_problem():
    # Given b/r = 3/1, so b = 3r
    # Given w/b = 16/3, so w = (16/3)b = (16/3)*3r = 16r
    # Sum equation: w + b + r = 16r + 3r + r = 20r = 1
    # Therefore r = 1/20
    # Then w = 16r = 16/20 = 4/5
    
    # For demonstration, we'll show the step-by-step calculation
    r = Fraction(1, 20)
    b = 3 * r
    w = 16 * r
    
    print(f"r = {r}")
    print(f"b = {b}")
    print(f"w = {w}")
    print(f"Sum: {w + b + r}")  # Should be 1
    print(f"w/b: {w/b}")  # Should be 16/3
    print(f"b/r: {b/r}")  # Should be 3/1
