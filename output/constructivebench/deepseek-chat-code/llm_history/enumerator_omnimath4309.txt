[write_program]
This problem involves transforming a multiset of numbers {51, 49, 5} into 105 ones using two operations: combining two numbers (a+b) or splitting even numbers into two halves. We need to determine if this transformation is impossible (¬∃ steps).

To approach this, we'll write a Python program that:
1. Models the operations
2. Performs breadth-first search to explore all reachable states
3. Checks if the target state (105 ones) is reachable

We'll use memoization and pruning to optimize the search.

```python
from collections import deque

def main():
    initial = (51, 49, 5)
    target = tuple([1]*105)
    
    visited = set()
    queue = deque()
    queue.append(initial)
    visited.add(initial)
    
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        current_list = list(current)
        
        # Print intermediate states of interest
        if len(current) <= 5:
            print(f"Current state: {sorted(current)}")
        
        if current == target:
            print("Target reached!")
            return
        
        # Operation 1: Combine any two numbers
        for i in range(len(current_list)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(current_list)):
                new_list = current_list.copy()
                a, b = new_list.pop(j), new_list.pop(i)
                new_list.append(a + b)
                new_state = tuple(sorted(new_list))
                if new_state not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state)
                    queue.append(new_state)
        
        # Operation 2: Split even numbers
        for i in range(len(current_list)):
            a = current_list[i]
            if a % 2 == 0:
                new_list = current_list.copy()
                new_list.pop(i)
                new_list.extend([a//2, a//2])
                new_state = tuple(sorted(new_list))
                if new_state not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state)
                    queue.append(new_state)
    
    print("Target not reachable after exploring all possibilities")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
