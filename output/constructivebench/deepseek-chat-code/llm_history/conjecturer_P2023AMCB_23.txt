theorem P2023AMCB_23 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | card (image (fun (d : Fin n → Fin 6) => 
    ∏ i, (d i).val + 1) univ) = 936} P2023AMCB_23_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=1, distinct products=6
n=2, distinct products=18
n=3, distinct products=40
n=4, distinct products=75
n=5, distinct products=126
n=6, distinct products=196
n=7, distinct products=288
n=8, distinct products=405
n=9, distinct products=550
n=10, distinct products=726
n=11, distinct products=936
Minimal n where count equals 936 is 11. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<11>>>
