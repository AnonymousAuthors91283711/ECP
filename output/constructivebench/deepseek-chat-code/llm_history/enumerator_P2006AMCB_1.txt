[write_program]
This problem involves calculating the sum of alternating signs for a given n (2006 in this case). The sum is (-1)^(k+1) from k=0 to k=n-1. We'll write a Python program to compute this sum for various small values of n to identify the pattern.

The pattern is straightforward: for odd n, the sum is 1 (since pairs of -1 and +1 cancel out, leaving one +1), and for even n, the sum is 0 (all terms cancel out perfectly). We'll verify this pattern by computing the sum for several small values of n.

```python
def alternating_sum(n):
    """Compute the sum of (-1)^(k+1) for k from 0 to n-1"""
    return sum((-1)**(k+1) for k in range(n))

# Test for small values of n to observe the pattern
for n in range(1, 11):
    print(f"n={n}: sum = {alternating_sum(n)}")

# Since 2006 is even, the sum should be 0
n = 2006
print(f"\nFor n={n}: sum = {alternating_sum(n)}")
```
