[write_program]
This problem involves finding the sum of an alternating series with coefficients defined by a generating function condition. We'll write a Python program to numerically approximate the sum by truncating the series and verifying the given conditions.

The approach:
1. For small values of n, compute a[n] by solving the system of equations derived from the condition ∑ choose(n,k)*a[n] = (1/5)^k
2. Use these computed a[n] values to approximate the alternating sum ∑ (-1)^(n+1)*a[n]
3. Observe the convergence pattern to conjecture the exact value

```python
import numpy as np
from math import comb

def compute_a_coefficients(max_n):
    """Compute a[n] coefficients up to max_n by solving the linear system"""
    # Build the system of equations: M * a_vec = b_vec
    M = np.zeros((max_n, max_n))
    b = np.zeros(max_n)
    
    for k in range(max_n):
        b[k] = (1/5)**k
        for n in range(max_n):
            M[k, n] = comb(n, k) if n >= k else 0
    
    # Solve the system
    a_vec = np.linalg.solve(M, b)
    return a_vec

def compute_alternating_sum(a_vec):
    """Compute the alternating sum using computed a coefficients"""
    total = 0.0
    for n in range(len(a_vec)):
        term = (-1)**(n+1) * a_vec[n]
        total += term
        print(f"After n={n}: partial sum = {total}")
    return total

# Main computation
max_n = 10  # Small enough for demonstration, increase for better accuracy
print(f"Computing with max_n={max_n}")
a_coeffs = compute_a_coefficients(max_n)
print("Computed a coefficients:", a_coeffs)
final_sum = compute_alternating_sum(a_coeffs)
print("Final approximation of alternating sum:", final_sum)
```
