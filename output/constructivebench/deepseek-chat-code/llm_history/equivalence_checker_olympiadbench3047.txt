theorem olympiadbench3047 (x : ℝ) (hx : x > 0) (h : logb (sqrt 2) x = 20) :
    logb 2 (sqrt x) = olympiadbench3047_answer x := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 5
Proposed Answer: fun _ : ℝ => 10
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us:
   - x > 0
   - logb (√2) x = 20
   - Asks to find logb 2 (√x)

2. Let's solve it step by step:
   - logb (√2) x = 20 ⇒ x = (√2)^20 = (2^(1/2))^20 = 2^10
   - Now we need logb 2 (√x) = logb 2 (√(2^10)) = logb 2 (2^5) = 5

3. Ground truth answer is correct: 5
4. Proposed answer gives 10, which is incorrect

The proposed answer is wrong because it doesn't account for the square root in the final logarithm and gives double the correct value.
