abbrev omnimath1646_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1646 (n : ℕ) :
  (∃ a b : ℕ, a^2 + b^2 = n ∧ Nat.Coprime a b ∧ 
   ∀ p : ℕ, p.Prime → p ≤ Real.sqrt n → p ∣ a * b) ↔ n ∈ omnimath1646_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found: n = 2 with (a,b) = (1,1)
Found: n = 5 with (a,b) = (1,2)
Found: n = 13 with (a,b) = (2,3)

All qualifying n values found:
[2, 5, 13]. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{n | ∃ k : ℕ, n = k^2 + 1 ∨ n = k^2 + (k + 1)^2}>>>
