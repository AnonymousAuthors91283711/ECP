Ground Truth Answer: 5
Proposed Answer: 13
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is setting up an equation about two people's speeds (Josh and Mike) traveling a distance of 13 units in some time t.

2. From the given equations:
   - Mike's speed is 13/t
   - Josh's speed is (4/5)*(13/t)
   - The equation josh_speed*(2t) + mike_speed*t = 13 represents the total distance covered when Josh travels for 2t time and Mike travels for t time.

3. Solving the equation:
   (4/5)*(13/t)*(2t) + (13/t)*t = 13
   (4/5)*13*2 + 13 = 13
   (104/5) + 13 = 13
   (104/5) + (65/5) = 13
   169/5 = 13
   This is incorrect, which suggests the ground truth answer of 5 is correct (169/13 = 13).

4. The proposed answer is 13, which doesn't satisfy the equation. The correct answer should be 5.
