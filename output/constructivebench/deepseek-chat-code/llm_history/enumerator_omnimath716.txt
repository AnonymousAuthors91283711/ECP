This problem involves finding rational pairs (r,s) for which the cubic polynomial P(x) = x³ + 10x² + rx + s has infinitely many primes p where P evaluates to integers divisible by p at three distinct integer points a < b < c < p/3.

We'll approach this by:
1. Enumerating small integer values for a, b, c to find patterns
2. Checking when P(a), P(b), P(c) are all divisible by p
3. Looking for (r,s) pairs that satisfy these conditions for multiple p

The key observation is that for P to evaluate to integers at three points, it must be integer-valued at all integers (since third differences are constant). This requires r and s to be integers.

from itertools import combinations

def find_rs_candidates(max_abc=5, max_p=100):
    # We'll search for a,b,c up to max_abc and primes up to max_p
    results = set()
    
    for a, b, c in combinations(range(max_abc + 1), 3):
        if a >= b or b >= c:
            continue
            
        # The polynomial must be integer-valued at a, b, c
        # So we solve for r and s in:
        # a³ + 10a² + r*a + s = k (integer)
        # b³ + 10b² + r*b + s = m (integer)
        # c³ + 10c² + r*c + s = n (integer)
        
        # Solving the first two equations for r and s:
        # r = (m - k - (b³ - a³) - 10(b² - a²))/(b - a)
        # s = k - a³ - 10a² - r*a
        
        # For simplicity, we'll set k=m=n=0 first

                continue
                
            # Check if p divides all three evaluations (which are 0 here)
