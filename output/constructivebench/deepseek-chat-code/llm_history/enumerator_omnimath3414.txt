[write_program]
This problem is asking to find the smallest natural number `omnimath3414_answer` less than 23 such that `23 - omnimath3414_answer` is not divisible by 3. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all numbers less than 23 and check this condition.

The approach is:
1. Iterate through numbers from 0 to 22 (inclusive)
2. For each number, check if (23 - number) is not divisible by 3
3. The smallest such number is our answer

```python
def find_min_non_divisible():
    for n in range(23):  # Check numbers from 0 to 22
        if (23 - n) % 3 != 0:
            print(f"Found candidate: {n}")
            return n  # Return the first (smallest) found
    return None  # Shouldn't reach here for this problem

answer = find_min_non_divisible()
print(f"The smallest number is: {answer}")
```
