Ground Truth Answer: fun x => x ^ 2 - 2 * x + 2
Proposed Answer: fun y => (y - 1)^2 + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We're given:
   - f(x) = 2x + 1 (from hf)
   - g(f(x)) = 4x² + 1 (from hg)

2. To find g(y), we can substitute y = f(x) = 2x + 1, then solve for x in terms of y:
   x = (y - 1)/2

3. Substitute into g(f(x)):
   g(y) = 4[(y - 1)/2]² + 1
        = 4[(y - 1)²/4] + 1
        = (y - 1)² + 1

4. Now compare with ground truth:
   (y - 1)² + 1 = y² - 2y + 1 + 1 = y² - 2y + 2

The proposed answer is exactly equal to the ground truth answer when expanded. They are just written in different but equivalent forms.
