[write_program]
The problem appears to be a Lean theorem about properties of a function `omnimath3490_answer` at n=7. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values that satisfy the given conditions when n=7.

The conditions are:
1. `omnimath3490_answer 7` must be even
2. 9*7 is not even
3. 7+8 is not even
4. 7Â² is not even
5. 7*(7-2) is not even

We'll check small even numbers as candidates for `omnimath3490_answer 7` since the first condition requires it to be even. The other conditions are fixed properties of n=7 that we can verify first.

```python
def main():
    n = 7
    # Verify the fixed conditions for n=7
    conditions_met = True
    if (9 * n) % 2 == 0:
        conditions_met = False
    if (n + 8) % 2 == 0:
        conditions_met = False
    if (n ** 2) % 2 == 0:
        conditions_met = False
    if (n * (n - 2)) % 2 == 0:
        conditions_met = False
    
    if not conditions_met:
        print("Fixed conditions not satisfied for n=7")
        return
    
    print("Possible even values for omnimath3490_answer(7):")
    # Check small even numbers up to 100
    for x in range(0, 101, 2):
        print(x)
    
    print("Enumerated even candidates up to 100")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
