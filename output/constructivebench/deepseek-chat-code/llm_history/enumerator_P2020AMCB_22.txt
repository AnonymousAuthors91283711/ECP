[write_program]
This problem asks for the maximum value of the function f(t) = ((2^t - 3t)*t)/(4^t) for t ∈ ℝ. We'll write a Python program to numerically approximate this maximum by evaluating the function at various points and finding where it peaks.

The approach will be:
1. Sample t values in a reasonable range (since 4^t grows rapidly, we focus near 0)
2. Compute f(t) at each point
3. Track the maximum value found
4. Print intermediate results and finally the maximum

```python
import math

def f(t):
    numerator = (2**t - 3 * t) * t
    denominator = 4**t
    return numerator / denominator

# Search around where we expect the maximum (between 0 and 2)
start = 0.0
end = 2.0
step = 0.0001

max_value = -float('inf')
best_t = 0.0

t = start
while t <= end:
    current = f(t)
    if current > max_value:
        max_value = current
        best_t = t
        print(f"New max {max_value:.10f} at t={t:.5f}")
    t += step

print(f"\nFinal result: Maximum value ≈ {max_value:.10f} occurs at t ≈ {best_t:.5f}")
```
