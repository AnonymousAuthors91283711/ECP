[write_program]
This problem involves solving for k in the equation logT = 2 - log2 + logk, where logT is given as log(650). We'll write a Python program to numerically approximate the value of k by rearranging the equation and computing it directly.

The key steps are:
1. Compute logT = log(650)
2. Rearrange the equation to solve for k: k = exp(logT - 2 + log2)
3. Compute this value numerically

```python
import math

def compute_k():
    T = 650
    logT = math.log(T)
    log2 = math.log(2)
    k = math.exp(logT - 2 + log2)
    print(k)

compute_k()
```
