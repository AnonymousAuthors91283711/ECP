The problem asks for the number of natural numbers `n` that are perfect squares and whose square roots divide `2^3 * 3^5 * 5^7 * 7^9`. To solve this, we need to find all possible exponents for each prime in the square root `m` such that `m` divides the given number.

Here's a Python program that enumerates all possible combinations of exponents for each prime in `m` (which must be â‰¤ the corresponding exponent in the original number divided by 2, since `m` is squared):

```python
def count_divisors():
    # The prime factorization of the original number: 2^3 * 3^5 * 5^7 * 7^9
    exponents = [3, 5, 7, 9]
    
    # For each prime, possible exponents in m are 0 to floor(e/2)
    possible_exponents = []
    for e in exponents:
        possible_exponents.append(list(range(0, e // 2 + 1)))
    
    # Count all combinations of possible exponents
    count = 0
    for e2 in possible_exponents[0]:
        for e3 in possible_exponents[1]:
            for e5 in possible_exponents[2]:
                for e7 in possible_exponents[3]:
                    count += 1
                    # Print each valid combination (optional)
                    print(f"m = 2^{e2} * 3^{e3} * 5^{e5} * 7^{e7}")
    
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

count_divisors()
```

The program calculates all valid combinations of exponents for the prime factors of `m` (where each exponent is at most half of the corresponding exponent in the original number, rounded down). The total count of these combinations gives the number of possible `n` values that satisfy the conditions. The program prints each valid combination of exponents for `m` and finally the total count.
