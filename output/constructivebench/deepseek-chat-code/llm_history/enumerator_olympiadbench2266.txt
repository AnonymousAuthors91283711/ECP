[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of equations to find real values of r that satisfy the given conditions. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible solutions by solving the equations symbolically.

The system is:
1. 4 + d = 4r
2. 4r + d = 4rÂ²

We can solve for d from the first equation and substitute into the second equation to find possible r values.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_solutions():
    r, d = symbols('r d')
    # Equation 1: 4 + d = 4r
    eq1 = Eq(4 + d, 4*r)
    # Equation 2: 4r + d = 4*r**2
    eq2 = Eq(4*r + d, 4*r**2)
    
    # Solve equation 1 for d
    d_sol = solve(eq1, d)[0]
    # Substitute into equation 2
    eq2_sub = eq2.subs(d, d_sol)
    # Solve for r
    r_solutions = solve(eq2_sub, r)
    
    # Print all solutions
    for sol in r_solutions:
        print(f"Solution found: r = {sol}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solutions()
```
