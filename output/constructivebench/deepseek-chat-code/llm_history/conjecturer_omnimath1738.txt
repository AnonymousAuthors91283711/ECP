Testing quadratic functions.... Expected Answer Type: (ℤ → ℤ) → Prop
From the enumerated answers, we see that the solutions are either constant zero or linear functions of the form f(x) = k*x. The functional equation appears to be satisfied by all linear functions, suggesting the answer is that f must be linear. The constant zero function is a special case of linear functions (k=0).
