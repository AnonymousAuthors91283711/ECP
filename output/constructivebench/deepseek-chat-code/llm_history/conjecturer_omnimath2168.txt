From the enumerated answers, we observe that the polynomial x³ - 5x² - 5x + p has three distinct real roots for various values of p. The pattern suggests this occurs when p is between the local maximum and minimum of the cubic. The critical points are at x = (5±√(25+60))/6 = (5±√85)/6. Evaluating the polynomial at these points gives the range for p.

From the enumerated answers, we can observe that the polynomial x³ - 5x² - 5x + p has three distinct real roots for certain values of p. The pattern shows that as p increases from negative to positive values, the roots remain distinct until a certain point.

The key is to find the range of p where the cubic polynomial has three distinct real roots. For a general cubic x³ + ax² + bx + c, this occurs between the local maximum and minimum values. For our specific polynomial x³ - 5x² - 5x + p, we can find these critical points by taking the derivative and solving:

1. Derivative: 3x² - 10x - 5 = 0
2. Solutions: x = (5 ± √85)/3

Evaluating the original polynomial at these critical points gives the bounds for p. The proposed answer correctly captures this range but needs proper Lean syntax and polynomial definition.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<{p : ℝ | let Q := fun x : ℝ => x^3 - 5 * x^2 - 5 * x + p;
    ∃ (x1 x2 : ℝ), 3 * x1^2 - 10 * x1 - 5 = 0 ∧ 3 * x2^2 - 10 * x2 - 5 = 0 ∧ x1 ≠ x2 ∧
    Q x1 * Q x2 < 0}>>>

Explanation:
1. We properly define Q as the polynomial function
2. We find the critical points where derivative is zero (x1 and x2)
3. The condition Q(x1)*Q(x2) < 0 ensures the polynomial has three real roots (Intermediate Value Theorem)
4. This is equivalent to p being between the local maximum and minimum values of the polynomial[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

From the enumerated answers, we can observe that the polynomial has three distinct real roots for p values between approximately -1.1 and 1.1. The key insight is that this occurs when the cubic polynomial has two distinct critical points (where derivative is zero) and the polynomial evaluates to opposite signs at these critical points.

The derivative of Q(x) = x³ - 5x² - 5x + p is Q'(x) = 3x² - 10x - 5. The condition for three distinct real roots is that Q(x) must have two distinct critical points (roots of Q') and the product Q(x1)*Q(x2) < 0 (intermediate value theorem).

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<{p : ℝ | let Q := fun p x => x^3 - 5 * x^2 - 5 * x + p;
    let x1 := (5 - 2 * Real.sqrt 10) / 3;
    let x2 := (5 + 2 * Real.sqrt 10) / 3;
    x1 ≠ x2 ∧ Q p x1 * Q p x2 < 0}>>>

Explanation:
1. We define Q as a function of both p and x
2. We calculate the two distinct critical points x1 and x2 from Q' = 0
3. The condition Q(x1)*Q(x2) < 0 ensures three distinct real roots by intermediate value theorem
4. The critical points are guaranteed distinct since the discriminant (100 - 4*3*(-5)) = 160 > 0[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

From the enumerated answers, we can observe that the polynomial x³ - 5x² - 5x + p has three distinct real roots for a range of p values. The key is to find when the cubic has two critical points (local max/min) with opposite signs (Intermediate Value Theorem condition for three real roots).

The proposed answer was close but had syntax issues. Here's the corrected version:

<<<{p : ℝ | let Q := fun p => X^3 - 5 * X^2 - 5 * X + C p;
    let x1 := (5 - 2 * Real.sqrt 10)/3;
    let x2 := (5 + 2 * Real.sqrt 10)/3;
    x1 ≠ x2 ∧ (Q p).eval x1 * (Q p).eval x2 < 0}>>>

Explanation:
1. The polynomial Q is defined using Polynomial.X notation
2. We use C p to represent the constant term p as a polynomial
3. The critical points x1 and x2 are correctly calculated
4. The condition checks that the polynomial evaluates to opposite signs at these critical points
5. This ensures three distinct real roots by the Intermediate Value Theorem

The error in the original was due to incorrect polynomial construction and evaluation syntax. The fixed version properly constructs the polynomial and evaluates it at the critical points.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

From the enumerated answers, we can observe that the polynomial has three distinct real roots for a range of p values. The key insight is that this occurs when the polynomial has a local maximum and minimum (critical points) with opposite signs, which happens between the two critical points x1 and x2.

The proposed answer was close but had syntax issues. Here's the corrected version:

<<<{p : ℝ | let Q := fun p => X^3 - 5 * X^2 - 5 * X + C p;
    let x1 := (5 - 2 * Real.sqrt 10)/3;
    let x2 := (5 + 2 * Real.sqrt 10)/3;
    (Q p).eval x1 * (Q p).eval x2 < 0}>>>

Explanation:
1. The polynomial Q(p) = X³ - 5X² - 5X + p has critical points at x1 and x2 (roots of derivative)
2. For three distinct real roots, the polynomial must have opposite signs at these critical points (Intermediate Value Theorem)
3. The condition (Q p).eval x1 * (Q p).eval x2 < 0 ensures this
4. We removed the redundant x1 ≠ x2 condition since sqrt(10) ensures they're distinct
5. The set includes all p where this condition holds, giving the range where three distinct real roots exist
