Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1), (2, 2^2017)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1)} ∪ {(a, 1) | a > 1} ∪ {(1, b) | b > 1}
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem asks for pairs (a,b) where a*b divides a^2017 + b. The ground truth gives two specific pairs: (1,1) and (2,2^2017).

The proposed answer includes:
1. (1,1) - correct
2. All (a,1) where a>1 - but a*1=a must divide a^2017+1, which is only true when a divides 1 (i.e., a=1, already covered)
3. All (1,b) where b>1 - but 1*b=b must divide 1^2017+b = 1+b, which is only true when b divides b+1, meaning b=1 (already covered)

The proposed answer misses (2,2^2017) which clearly works since 2*2^2017 divides 2^2017 + 2^2017 = 2^2018, and includes many incorrect pairs.
