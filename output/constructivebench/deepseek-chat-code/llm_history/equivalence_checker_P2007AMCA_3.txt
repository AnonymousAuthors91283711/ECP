Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a number (P2007AMCA_3_answer) that satisfies:
   - There exist odd integers a < b where b = 3a and a + b equals this number
   - This is the only possible such number that satisfies these conditions

2. Let's find the correct answer:
   - Given b = 3a and both are odd
   - a + b = a + 3a = 4a
   - Since a must be odd, let's try a=1: b=3, sum=4
   - a=3: b=9, sum=12
   - a=-1: b=-3, sum=-4
   - The smallest positive solution is 4 (when a=1)

3. The ground truth says 8, but:
   - For sum=8, we'd need 4a=8 ⇒ a=2, but 2 is not odd
   - Therefore 8 cannot be correct as it doesn't satisfy the conditions

4. The proposed answer is 4, which works for a=1 (odd), b=3 (odd), and is indeed the smallest positive solution.

The ground truth answer is incorrect while the proposed answer is correct.
