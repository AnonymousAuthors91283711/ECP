Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 1, 3), (1, 2, -3), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, -1), (0, 0, 0)}
Proposed Answer: {(0, 0, 0)} ∪ (Set.range fun n : ℤ => (0, n, -n)) ∪ (Set.range fun n : ℤ => (n, 0, n)) ∪ 
(Set.range fun n : ℤ => (n, 2*n, -3*n)) ∪ (Set.range fun n : ℤ => (2*n, n, 3*n))
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. The ground truth lists specific solutions:
   - (2,1,3), (1,2,-3), (1,0,1), (0,1,-1), (0,0,0)

2. The proposed answer gives parametric solutions:
   - (0,0,0)
   - (0,n,-n) which includes (0,1,-1) when n=1
   - (n,0,n) which includes (1,0,1) when n=1
   - (n,2n,-3n) which includes (1,2,-3) when n=1
   - (2n,n,3n) which includes (2,1,3) when n=1

The proposed answer covers all ground truth cases through specific parameter values, and also includes all integer multiples of these solutions. However, we need to verify if these are indeed all solutions to the original system of equations.

The ground truth appears to list only the minimal/non-multiple solutions, while the proposed answer gives the complete parametric solution set. Therefore, the proposed answer is more general but includes all cases from the ground truth.
