This problem involves finding the sum of coefficients of a 4th-degree real polynomial with given complex roots. Since complex roots come in conjugate pairs, the roots must be 2i, -2i, 2+i, and 2-i. We'll construct the polynomial from these roots and compute the sum of its coefficients.

```python
from sympy import symbols, I, expand, Poly

def main():
    x = symbols('x')
    # Roots: 2i, -2i, 2+i, 2-i
    roots = [2*I, -2*I, 2+I, 2-I]
    
    # Construct polynomial from roots
    poly = 1
    for r in roots:
        poly *= (x - r)
    
    # Expand and get coefficients
    expanded = expand(poly)
    p = Poly(expanded, x)
    coeffs = p.all_coeffs()
    
    # Compute sum of coefficients (c3 + c2 + c1 + c0)
    # Note: SymPy returns coefficients from highest degree first
    sum_coeffs = sum(coeffs[-4:])  # Take last 4 coefficients (x^3 to x^0)
    
    # Print exact and numerical value
    print(f"Exact sum of coefficients: {sum_coeffs}")
    print(f"Numerical value: {sum_coeffs.evalf()}")

    main()
```
