Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => a ^ (logb 2 a) * 2 ^ (b ^ 2)
Proposed Answer: fun a b => a^(b + 1) * 2^b
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two equations:
   - a * 2^b = 8
   - a^b = 2

2. From the second equation (a^b = 2), we can express b as b = logₐ2

3. The ground truth answer uses this logarithmic relationship explicitly: a^(log₂a) * 2^(b²)

4. The proposed answer suggests a^(b+1) * 2^b

Let's test with a=2, b=1 (which satisfies both equations):
- Ground truth: 2^(log₂2) * 2^(1²) = 2^1 * 2^1 = 4
- Proposed: 2^(1+1) * 2^1 = 4 * 2 = 8
But the theorem states the answer should be 128, so neither matches in this case.

However, let's find the correct solution:
From a^b = 2, we get b = ln2/lna
From a*2^b = 8, substitute b: a*2^(ln2/lna) = 8
This leads to a = 4, b = 0.5 (since 4^0.5 = 2 and 4*2^0.5 ≈ 5.656 ≠ 8)
Wait, this shows the proposed answer doesn't satisfy the given conditions.

The ground truth answer when a=4, b=0.5:
4^(log₂4) * 2^(0.25) = 4^2 * 2^0.25 ≈ 16*1.189 ≈ 19.02 ≠ 128

Neither answer seems correct, but they're also not equivalent to each other.
