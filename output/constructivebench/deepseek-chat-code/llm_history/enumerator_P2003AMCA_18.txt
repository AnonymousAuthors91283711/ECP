This problem asks for the count of 5-digit numbers (from 10000 to 99999) where the sum of the first 3 digits and last 2 digits is divisible by 11. We'll enumerate all such numbers and count them.

```python
count = 0
for n in range(10000, 100000):
    first_part = n // 100  # first 3 digits
    last_part = n % 100    # last 2 digits
    if (first_part + last_part) % 11 == 0:
        print(n)  # stream each valid number
        count += 1
print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
