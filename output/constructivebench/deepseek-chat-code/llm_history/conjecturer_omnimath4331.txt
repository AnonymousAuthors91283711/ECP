. Expected Answer Type: Prop
Based on the problem statement and the enumerated answer, I can see this is about finding a condition that prevents a recurrence relation of polynomials from having integer roots for all n. The error in the proposed answer appears to be due to mismatched parentheses and an extra closing parenthesis.

The key insight from the enumerated answer shows P0 has root -1 (which is rational) and P1 evaluated at -1 is non-zero (-4 ≠ 0). The condition should capture that while P0 has a rational root, P1 doesn't vanish at that root, and this prevents all Pn from having integer roots.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<∀ (P : ℕ → Polynomial ℤ), (∀ n, natDegree (P n) ≤ 2) → (∀ n ≥ 2, P n = P (n-1) + P (n-2)) → (∃ x : ℚ, eval₂ (algebraMap ℤ ℚ) x (P 0) = 0 ∧ eval₂ (algebraMap ℤ ℚ) x (P 1) ≠ 0) → ¬(∀ n, ∃ x : ℤ, eval x (P n) = 0)>>>

Explanation:
1. Changed the quantifier order and removed unused a,b parameters
2. Fixed parentheses structure
3. Changed the condition to existential form (∃ x) since we need there to exist at least one rational root of P0 where P1 doesn't vanish
4. This matches the pattern seen in the enumerated answer where P0(-1)=0 but P1(-1)≠0
5. The conclusion remains that not all Pn can have integer roots under these conditions
