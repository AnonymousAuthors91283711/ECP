The problem involves placing red points on a 20x20 grid with certain constraints, and finding the maximum number of red points possible. The key constraints are:
1. Each red point must be at least √5 distance from all other red points
2. No point outside the occupied set (red points + given set B) can satisfy the red placement condition

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible configurations and find the maximum number of red points. The approach will:
1. Model the grid as coordinates from (1,1) to (20,20)
2. Use backtracking to place points while maintaining the distance constraint
3. Keep track of the maximum number of points found

```python
def main():
    grid_size = 20
    max_red = 0
    # We'll use a set to track placed points
    placed = set()
    # The minimal squared distance is 5 (since √5 is required)
    min_sq_dist = 5
    
    def is_valid(p, current_placed):
        x, y = p
        # Check within grid bounds
        if not (1 <= x <= grid_size and 1 <= y <= grid_size):
            return False
        # Check distance to all placed points
        for (px, py) in current_placed:
            dx = x - px
            dy = y - py
            if dx*dx + dy*dy < min_sq_dist:
                return False
        return True
    
    def backtrack(start_x, start_y, current_placed):
        nonlocal max_red
        current_count = len(current_placed)
        if current_count > max_red:
            max_red = current_count
            print(f"New maximum found: {max_red}")
        
        # Try to place next point after (start_x, start_y)
        for x in range(start_x, grid_size + 1):
            for y in range(1 if x > start_x else start_y, grid_size + 1):
                if is_valid((x, y), current_placed):
                    current_placed.add((x, y))
                    backtrack(x, y + 1, current_placed)
                    current_placed.remove((x, y))
    
    # Start backtracking from (1,1)
    backtrack(1, 1, placed)
    print(f"Final maximum: {max_red}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note: This is a basic implementation that may take a long time to run for the full 20x20 grid. In practice, you might want to:
1. Add symmetry breaking to avoid redundant searches
2. Implement more efficient pruning strategies
3. Use memoization or other optimizations
4. Consider smaller grid sizes first to test the approach

The program will print new maximums as they're found and finally output the largest count discovered.
