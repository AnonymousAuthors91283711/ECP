Ground Truth Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ α, f = fun x => α - x}
Proposed Answer: { f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, f = fun x => -x + c }
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer and ground truth answer are equivalent. Both describe the set of all linear functions of the form f(x) = -x + c (or equivalently f(x) = c - x), where c is a real constant. The only difference is the order of terms (-x + c vs c - x), which doesn't affect the function's behavior. Both answers correctly characterize the solution set for the given functional inequality.
