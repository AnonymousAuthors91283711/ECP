[write_program]
This problem involves computing a triple sum of binomial coefficients modulo 1000. We'll write a Python program to compute this sum efficiently by iterating through all valid combinations of a and b, calculating the product of binomial coefficients, and accumulating the total sum.

The approach:
1. Iterate a from 0 to 6 (inclusive)
2. For each a, iterate b from 0 to 6-a (inclusive)
3. Compute the product of three binomial coefficients: C(6,a) * C(6,b) * C(6,a+b)
4. Accumulate the sum
5. Finally take modulo 1000 of the total sum

We'll use Python's math.comb for binomial coefficients since it's efficient and available in Python 3.10+.

```python
import math

def compute_sum():
    total = 0
    for a in range(7):
        for b in range(7 - a):
            term = math.comb(6, a) * math.comb(6, b) * math.comb(6, a + b)
            total += term
    return total % 1000

result = compute_sum()
print(result)
```
