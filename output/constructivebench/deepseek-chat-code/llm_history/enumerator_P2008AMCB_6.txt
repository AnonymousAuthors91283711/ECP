[write_program]
The problem asks to find the integer closest to the distance walked, where the total steps are 44*100000 + 50000 = 4,450,000 steps, and there are 1800 steps per mile. The closest integer to 4,450,000 / 1800 â‰ˆ 2472.222... is 2472.

Here's a Python program that calculates and verifies this:

```python
total_steps = 44 * 100000 + 50000
steps_per_mile = 1800
distance = total_steps / steps_per_mile

# Calculate the two nearest integers
lower = int(distance)
upper = lower + 1

# Determine which is closer
if abs(distance - lower) <= abs(distance - upper):
    closest = lower
else:
    closest = upper

print(f"Exact distance: {distance}")
print(f"Closest integer: {closest}")
```
