Ground Truth Answer: fun total dog cat turtle => min (min dog cat) turtle - (dog + cat + turtle - 2 * total)
Proposed Answer: fun total dog cat turtle => min dog (min cat turtle) - (dog + cat + turtle - total - min dog (min cat turtle))
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. First term comparison:
- Ground truth: min (min dog cat) turtle
- Proposed: min dog (min cat turtle)
These are equivalent because min is associative and commutative.

2. Second term comparison:
- Ground truth: (dog + cat + turtle - 2 * total)
- Proposed: (dog + cat + turtle - total - min dog (min cat turtle))

The second terms are not equivalent. The ground truth version depends linearly on total, while the proposed version depends on the minimum of the three counts. These would only be equal in very specific cases (when min dog (min cat turtle) = total), but not in general.

For example, let's test with:
total = 10, dog = 4, cat = 5, turtle = 6
- Ground truth: min(4,5,6) - (4+5+6-20) = 4 - (-5) = 9
- Proposed: min(4,5,6) - (4+5+6-10-4) = 4 - (15-14) = 4-1 = 3

The results differ (9 vs 3), proving they're not equivalent.
