Ground Truth Answer: {m | m ≠ 1}
Proposed Answer: {m | m ≠ 1 ∧ (m = 2 ∨ ∃ k, m = k + 3)}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but overly restrictive compared to the ground truth. The ground truth correctly identifies that the condition holds for all m ≠ 1. The proposed answer adds unnecessary constraints by requiring m = 2 or m = k + 3, which excludes some valid cases (like m = 4, which satisfies the condition but isn't covered by the proposed answer's formulation). The core insight that m ≠ 1 is correct, but the additional constraints make the answer incomplete.
