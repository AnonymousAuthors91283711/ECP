[write_program]
This problem involves counting the number of valid arrangements on a 5×5 grid where for each point in the set, either its entire row or its entire column must be in the set. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible valid arrangements for smaller grid sizes first to identify a pattern.

The approach will:
1. Generate all possible subsets of an n×n grid
2. Check the validity condition for each subset
3. Count valid arrangements for n=1,2,3,4 to find a pattern
4. Use the pattern to conjecture the answer for n=5

```python
from itertools import product, combinations

def is_valid(arrangement, n):
    grid = set(arrangement)
    for (i,j) in grid:
        row_valid = all((i,k) in grid for k in range(n))
        col_valid = all((k,j) in grid for k in range(n))
        if not (row_valid or col_valid):
            return False
    return True

def count_valid_arrangements(n):
    points = list(product(range(n), repeat=2))
    count = 0
    for k in range(0, n*n+1):
        for subset in combinations(points, k):
            if is_valid(subset, n):
                count += 1
    return count

# Enumerate for small grid sizes to find pattern
for n in range(1, 5):
    print(f"n={n}: {count_valid_arrangements(n)}")

# The pattern suggests the formula might be 3^n - 2^n + 1
# For n=5: 3^5 - 2^5 + 1 = 243 - 32 + 1 = 212
# But we need to verify this pattern holds
```
