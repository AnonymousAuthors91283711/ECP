This problem appears to be about calculating the unclaimed portion after a series of fractional takings from a whole. The exact fractions are given in the problem statement. We'll compute the exact rational value of the unclaimed portion.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def calculate_unclaimed():
    total = Fraction(3 + 2 + 1)
    first_take = Fraction(3, total)
    remaining_after_first = 1 - first_take
    second_take = Fraction(2, total) * remaining_after_first
    remaining_after_second = remaining_after_first - second_take
    third_take = Fraction(1, total) * remaining_after_second
    unclaimed = 1 - (first_take + second_take + third_take)
    print(unclaimed)

calculate_unclaimed()
```
