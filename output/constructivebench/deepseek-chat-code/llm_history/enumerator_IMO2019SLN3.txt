This problem is from the IMO 2019 Shortlist (N3) and involves finding all integer sets S that satisfy certain polynomial root conditions. The problem is quite abstract, so we'll approach it by enumerating small candidate sets S and checking the conditions for small parameters.

We'll:
1. Consider small integer sets S as candidates
2. Check if they contain all differences of powers of 2 (2^a - 2^b)
3. Verify the polynomial condition for small n and simple polynomials

```python
def main():
    # We'll test small candidate sets S up to size 5 with elements between -10 and 10
    from itertools import combinations
    
    # First generate all possible differences of 2^a - 2^b for a,b <= 5
    required = set()
    for a in range(1, 6):
        for b in range(1, 6):
            if a != b:
                required.add(2**a - 2**b)
    
    print("Required elements (differences of powers of 2):", sorted(required))
    
    # Now test candidate sets S that contain all required elements
    elements = list(range(-10, 11))
    for size in range(len(required), 6):
        for candidate in combinations(elements, size):
            S = set(candidate)
            # Check if S contains all required differences
            if not required.issubset(S):
                continue
            
            print("\nTesting candidate set S:", sorted(S))
            
            # Now test the polynomial condition for n=1 and n=2
            valid = True
            # Case n=1: polynomial a0 + a1*x
            for a0 in S:
                for a1 in S:
                    if a1 == 0:
                        continue
                    root = -a0 // a1
                    if a0 + a1 * root != 0:
                        continue  # Not actually a root
                    if root not in S:

                continue
            
            # Case n=2: polynomial a0 + a1*x + a2*x^2
            for a0 in S:
                for a1 in S:
                    for a2 in S:
                        if a2 == 0:
                            continue  # reduces to n=1 case
                        # Check integer roots

                        if sqrt_disc**2 != discriminant:
                            continue

                            root = (-a1 + sign * sqrt_disc) // (2 * a2)
