This problem involves counting the maximum number of pairwise disjoint 2-element subsets (edges) that can be selected from a specific graph structure. The graph consists of:
1. 10 pairs of adjacent vertices (a_i, b_i)
2. 9 consecutive a_i, a_{i+1} pairs
3. 9 consecutive b_i, b_{i+1} pairs

We need to count the maximum number of edges that can be selected such that no two edges share any common vertices. The solution involves finding a maximum matching in this graph structure.

Here's a Python program that enumerates possible configurations and counts the maximum matching size:

```python
def main():
    # The graph has 20 vertices (0-19)
    # Edges are:
    # 1. {2i, 2i+1} for i in 0..9 (10 edges)
    # 2. {2i, 2i+2} for i in 0..8 (9 edges)
    # 3. {2i+1, 2i+3} for i in 0..8 (9 edges)
    # Total 28 edges
    
    # We'll represent edges as tuples (u,v) with u < v
    edges = []
    # Type 1 edges
    for i in range(10):
        edges.append((2*i, 2*i+1))
    # Type 2 edges
    for i in range(9):
        edges.append((2*i, 2*i+2))
    # Type 3 edges
    for i in range(9):
        edges.append((2*i+1, 2*i+3))
    
    # Now find maximum matching
    max_matching = 0
    
    # We'll use backtracking to find the maximum matching
    def backtrack(current_edges, remaining_edges, used_vertices):
        nonlocal max_matching
        if len(current_edges) > max_matching:
            max_matching = len(current_edges)
            print(f"Found matching of size {max_matching}: {current_edges}")
        
        if not remaining_edges:
            return
        
        # Try adding the next edge if possible
        next_edge = remaining_edges[0]
        u, v = next_edge
        if u not in used_vertices and v not in used_vertices:
            backtrack(current_edges + [next_edge], 
                     [e for e in remaining_edges[1:] if u not in e and v not in e],
                     used_vertices | {u, v})
        
        # Try skipping the next edge
        backtrack(current_edges, remaining_edges[1:], used_vertices)
    
    backtrack([], edges, set())
    print(f"Maximum matching size: {max_matching}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program:
1. Constructs all 28 edges of the graph
2. Uses backtracking to explore all possible matchings
3. Keeps track of the largest matching found
4. Prints intermediate results as it finds larger matchings
5. Finally prints the maximum matching size found

The output will show the progression of found matchings and ultimately reveal the maximum possible size of a matching in this graph structure.
