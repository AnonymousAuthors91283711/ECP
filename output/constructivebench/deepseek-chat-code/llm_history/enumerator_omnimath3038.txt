The problem states that `8 * x = 26` where `x` is a rational number. We need to find the exact value of `x` that satisfies this equation. The solution is straightforward: divide both sides by 8 to get `x = 26/8`, which can be simplified to `13/4`.

Here's a Python program that calculates and prints this exact rational value:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Calculate the exact rational solution to 8*x = 26
x = Fraction(26, 8)

# Simplify the fraction
x_simplified = x.limit_denominator()

# Print the exact value
print(f"The solution is: {x_simplified}")
```

The program uses Python's `fractions.Fraction` to handle exact rational arithmetic. It calculates 26/8 and then simplifies it to 13/4 automatically. The output will show the exact simplified fraction that solves the equation.
