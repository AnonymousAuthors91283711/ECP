This problem asks for the number of integer values of c such that the equation x^4 - 2c x^2 + (c+1) = 0 has exactly 12 distinct real roots. To solve this, we'll analyze the quartic equation's behavior for different integer c values.

The approach involves:
1. Treating the equation as a quadratic in y = x^2
2. Analyzing the discriminant and root conditions
3. Counting c values where the resulting roots give exactly 12 distinct real x values

We'll enumerate c values systematically and check the root conditions.

```python
def count_real_roots(c):
    # Treat as quadratic in y=x^2: y^2 - 2c y + (c+1) = 0
    discriminant = (2*c)**2 - 4*1*(c+1)
    if discriminant <= 0:
        return 0  # No real roots or repeated roots
    
    # Roots for y
    y1 = (2*c - discriminant**0.5)/2
    y2 = (2*c + discriminant**0.5)/2
    
    count = 0
    if y1 > 0:
        count += 2  # ±sqrt(y1)
    elif y1 == 0:
        count += 1  # just 0
    # else no roots from y1
    
    if y2 > 0:
        if y2 != y1:  # distinct roots
            count += 2  # ±sqrt(y2)
        else:
            count += 0  # already counted
    elif y2 == 0:
        if y1 != 0:  # distinct roots
            count += 1  # just 0
    # else no roots from y2
    
    return count

def main():
    valid_c = []
    # We check a reasonable range where 12 roots might occur
    for c in range(-10, 20):
        roots = count_real_roots(c)
        if roots == 12:
            valid_c.append(c)
            print(f"Found c = {c} with 12 real roots")
    
    print(f"Total count: {len(valid_c)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
