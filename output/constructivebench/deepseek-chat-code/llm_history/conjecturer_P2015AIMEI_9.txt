Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated answers, we can see that the problem is counting all possible triples (s₁, s₂, s₃) where each sᵢ is between 1 and 10 (inclusive), and there exists some n ≥ 3 where sₙ = 0. However, since the sequences must start with three values between 1 and 10, the count appears to be simply all possible combinations of three numbers from 1 to 10, which is 10 × 10 × 10 = 1000.

<<<1000>>>
