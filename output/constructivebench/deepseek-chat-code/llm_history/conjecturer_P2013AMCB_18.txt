  winner = P2013AMCB_18_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking winners for n from 1 to 20:
n = 1: Jenna
n = 2: First player
n = 3: Jenna
n = 4: First player
n = 5: Jenna
n = 6: First player
n = 7: Jenna
n = 8: First player
n = 9: Jenna
n = 10: First player
n = 11: Jenna
n = 12: First player
n = 13: Jenna
n = 14: First player
n = 15: Jenna
n = 16: First player
n = 17: Jenna
n = 18: First player
n = 19: Jenna
n = 20: First player

Checking specific values:
n = 2013: Jenna
n = 2014: First player. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → String
<<<fun n : ℕ => if n % 2 = 1 then "Jenna" else "First player">>>
