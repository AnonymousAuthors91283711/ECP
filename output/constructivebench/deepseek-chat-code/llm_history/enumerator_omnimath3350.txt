[write_program]
This problem involves simplifying the expression `2 * sqrt(1.5 + sqrt(2)) - (1.5 + sqrt(2))`. We'll write a Python program to numerically evaluate this expression and look for patterns or exact values that it might simplify to.

The approach is:
1. Compute the exact value of the expression numerically
2. Check if it matches any simple fractions or radicals
3. Print the numerical value with high precision

```python
import math

def compute_expression():
    sqrt2 = math.sqrt(2)
    inner = 1.5 + sqrt2
    sqrt_inner = math.sqrt(inner)
    result = 2 * sqrt_inner - inner
    return result

# Compute and print with high precision
value = compute_expression()
print(f"Numerical value: {value:.15f}")

# Check against some simple candidates
candidates = [
    0.5,
    1 - math.sqrt(2)/2,
    math.sqrt(2) - 0.5,
    math.sqrt(3)/2,
    (math.sqrt(5)-1)/2  # golden ratio
]

print("\nComparison with simple candidates:")
for c in candidates:
    diff = abs(value - c)
    print(f"Candidate {c:.15f}, difference: {diff:.15f}")

# The output shows the value is very close to 0.5
# Let's verify this algebraically:
# Let x = 1.5 + sqrt(2)
# Then the expression becomes 2*sqrt(x) - x
# If this equals 0.5, we'd have:
# 2*sqrt(x) = x + 0.5
# Square both sides: 4x = x² + x + 0.25
# => x² - 3x + 0.25 = 0
# Solutions: x = (3 ± sqrt(9-1))/2 = (3 ± sqrt(8))/2
# x = 1.5 + sqrt(2) is indeed one solution (3 + sqrt(8))/2
# Thus, the expression equals 0.5 exactly
```
