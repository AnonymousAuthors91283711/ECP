This problem involves counting how many problems the 10th student solved, given constraints about the first 9 students and each problem's solve count. We'll model this combinatorially by counting total solves in two ways.

```python
def main():
    students = 10
    problems_start = 1
    problems_end = 20  # Reasonable upper bound for testing
    
    for problems in range(problems_start, problems_end + 1):
        # Total solves by first 9 students (each solved 4 problems)
        first_nine_solves = 9 * 4
        
        # Total solves across all students (each problem solved by 7 students)
        total_solves = problems * 7
        
        # The 10th student's solves must make up the difference
        tenth_student_solves = total_solves - first_nine_solves
        
        # Check if this is a valid non-negative integer solution
        if tenth_student_solves >= 0 and tenth_student_solves <= problems:
            print(f"With {problems} problems, 10th student solved {tenth_student_solves}")
            
            # When we find the minimal problems count where solution exists
            if tenth_student_solves == 1:
                print("Minimum problems where 10th student solves exactly 1:", problems)
                break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
