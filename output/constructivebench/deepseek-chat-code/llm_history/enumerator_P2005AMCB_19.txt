This problem asks to find two-digit numbers x and y where y is the reverse of x's digits, such that x² - y² is a perfect square m², and then find the sum x + y + m. We'll enumerate all possible two-digit x values, compute y as the digit reversal, check if x² - y² is a perfect square, and collect valid combinations.

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    if n < 0:
        return False
    root = math.isqrt(n)
    return root * root == n

def find_valid_pairs():
    results = []
    for x in range(10, 100):
        # Compute y as digit reversal of x
        y = (x % 10) * 10 + (x // 10)
        if y < 10:  # y must also be two-digit
            continue
        
        diff = x*x - y*y
        if diff <= 0:
            continue
        
        if is_perfect_square(diff):
            m = math.isqrt(diff)
            sum_xy = x + y + m
            print(f"x={x}, y={y}, m={m} -> sum={sum_xy}")
            results.append((x, y, m, sum_xy))
    
    if results:
        print("\nAll valid sums found:")
        for r in results:
            print(f"x={r[0]}, y={r[1]}, m={r[2]} -> sum={r[3]}")
        print("\nPossible answer (smallest sum):", min(r[3] for r in results))
        print("Possible answer (largest sum):", max(r[3] for r in results))
