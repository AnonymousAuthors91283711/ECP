[write_program]
This problem involves finding natural numbers m where m ≥ T(m), with T(n) being the smallest positive integer k such that n divides the sum of numbers from 1 to k. We'll write a Python program to enumerate such numbers m by computing T(m) for small values and checking the condition.

The approach:
1. For each n, compute the smallest k where n divides the triangular number k(k+1)/2
2. Check if n ≥ T(n)
3. Output numbers satisfying the condition

```python
def smallest_k(n):
    """Find smallest k>0 where n divides k(k+1)/2"""
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular = k * (k + 1) // 2
        if triangular % n == 0:
            return k
        k += 1
        # Early exit if we've checked up to 2n (since T(n) <= 2n-1)
        if k > 2 * n:
            return 2 * n - 1  # Worst case for odd n

max_n = 100  # Reasonable upper bound for demonstration
results = []

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    T_n = smallest_k(n)
    if n >= T_n:
        results.append(n)
        print(n)  # Stream partial results

print("Found numbers m ≥ T(m) up to", max_n, ":", results)
```
