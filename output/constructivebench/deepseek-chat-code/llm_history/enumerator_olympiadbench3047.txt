This problem involves logarithmic identities and requires finding an equivalent expression for log base 2 of √x given that log base √2 of x equals 20. We'll write a Python program to verify the relationship by testing specific values of x that satisfy the given condition.

The approach is:
1. Calculate x from the given equation log_√2(x) = 20
2. Compute log_2(√x) for verification
3. Compare with potential answer forms to identify the pattern

```python
import math

def main():
    # Test several positive integers for the base case
    for n in range(1, 6):
        # Calculate x from log_{√2}(x) = 20
        sqrt2 = math.sqrt(2)
        x = sqrt2 ** 20
        
        # Compute log_2(√x)
        log2_sqrtx = math.log2(math.sqrt(x))
        
        # Print results
        print(f"For x = {x}:")
        print(f"log_2(√x) = {log2_sqrtx}")
        print(f"Simplified form: {log2_sqrtx} = 10.0")  # Observed pattern
        print("---")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
