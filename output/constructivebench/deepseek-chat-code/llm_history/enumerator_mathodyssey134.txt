[write_program]
This problem is about finding the maximum number of subsets of a 10-element set where any two subsets intersect (pairwise intersecting family), and any additional subset would violate this property (maximal condition). This is related to the Erd≈ës-Ko-Rado theorem in combinatorics.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible maximal intersecting families of subsets of a 10-element set, counting their sizes to find the maximum. Due to computational complexity, we'll work with small subsets first and look for patterns.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_maximal_intersecting(family, universe_size=10):
    elements = set(range(universe_size))
    # Check all pairs in family intersect
    for s1, s2 in combinations(family, 2):
        if not set(s1) & set(s2):
            return False
    # Check maximality - any additional subset would violate intersection
    all_subsets = [set(s) for s in combinations(elements, 1)] + \
                  [set(s) for s in combinations(elements, 2)]
    for s in all_subsets:
        if s not in [set(f) for f in family]:
            intersects_all = True
            for t in family:
                if not s & set(t):
                    intersects_all = False
                    break
            if intersects_all:
                return False
    return True

def find_max_family_size(universe_size=4, max_k=10):
    elements = list(range(universe_size))
    max_size = 0
    # Check all possible families up to size max_k
    for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
        found = False
        for family in combinations([set(s) for s in combinations(elements, 1)] + 
                                 [set(s) for s in combinations(elements, 2)], k):
            if is_maximal_intersecting(family, universe_size):
                print(f"Found family of size {k}: {family}")
                max_size = max(max_size, k)
                found = True
        if found:
            print(f"Largest found so far: {max_size}")
        else:
            print(f"No families of size {k} found")
    return max_size

# Start with small universe size to find pattern
print("Testing with universe_size=4")
max_size = find_max_family_size(universe_size=4)
print(f"Maximum family size for universe_size=4: {max_size}")

# For n=10, we can't enumerate all, but the EKR theorem suggests answer is C(9,4)=126
# But we need to verify the maximal condition
print("\nFor n=10, theoretical maximum is likely C(9,4)=126")
print("Full enumeration impractical, but this is the conjectured answer.")
```
