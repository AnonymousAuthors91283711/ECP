abbrev P2004AMCB_13_answer : ℤ := sorry
theorem P2004AMCB_13 (c : ℝ) (hc : c ≠ 3/2) :
    let f := fun c => 3 / (2 * c - 3)
    let finv := fun c => (3 + 3 * c) / (2 * c)
    ∃ k l m n : ℤ, finv c * c * f c = (k * c + l) / (m * c + n) ∧ k * n^2 / (l * m) = P2004AMCB_13_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: -2
Proposed Answer: 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves finding integers k, l, m, n such that:
   - finv c * c * f c can be expressed as (k*c + l)/(m*c + n)
   - The expression k*n²/(l*m) equals some integer answer

2. The ground truth answer is -2, while the proposed answer is 0.

3. For these to be equivalent, we'd need to show that -2 = 0, which is clearly false.

4. The proposed answer of 0 would only be correct if either:
   - k = 0 (but this would make the first condition impossible to satisfy)
   - n = 0 (but this would make the denominator in finv undefined when c=0)
   - l or m = ∞ (which is not possible in this context)

5. The ground truth answer of -2 comes from a valid solution where the expression evaluates to -2 for all c ≠ 3/2.

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
