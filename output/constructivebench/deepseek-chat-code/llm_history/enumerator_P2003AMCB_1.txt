[write_program]
The problem appears to be asking which value from the set {-1, -2/3, 2/3, 1, 14/3} satisfies some unspecified condition (implied by the theorem statement). Since we don't know the actual condition being tested, we'll write a program that simply enumerates all possible values from the given set, as these are the only candidates for the answer.

```python
def enumerate_candidates():
    candidates = [-1, -2/3, 2/3, 1, 14/3]
    for x in candidates:
        print(x)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_candidates()
```
