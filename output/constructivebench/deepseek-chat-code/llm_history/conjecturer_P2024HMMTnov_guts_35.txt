Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern, the expected_rounds decreases as N increases. The problem asks for the smallest N where expected_rounds < 2. From the enumerated values, we see expected_rounds starts at 10.0 for N=1 and decreases gradually. The threshold of 2 would occur when (1 - (N-1)/1024)^k terms become small enough in the summation. The solution likely involves solving (1024/(1025-N)) ≈ 2, giving N ≈ 1024/2 = 512.
