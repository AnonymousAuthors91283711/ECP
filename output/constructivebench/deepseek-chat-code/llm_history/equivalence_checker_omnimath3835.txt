Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0), (-2, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(0, 0), (2, -2), (-2, 2)}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer includes (2, -2) in addition to the ground truth answer's pairs. However, substituting (2, -2) into the equation m^5 - n^5 = 16*m*n gives:
2^5 - (-2)^5 = 32 - (-32) = 64
16*2*(-2) = -64
These are not equal (64 ≠ -64), so (2, -2) is not a valid solution. The proposed answer is mostly correct but includes one incorrect pair.
