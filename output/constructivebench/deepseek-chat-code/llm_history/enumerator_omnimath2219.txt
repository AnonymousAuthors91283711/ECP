[write_program]
This problem involves finding the largest subset S of integers from 1 to 2015 where for any two distinct elements a and b in S, the difference (a - b) does not divide the sum (a + b). We'll write a Python program to find the maximum size of such subsets for smaller ranges first to identify a pattern.

The approach will:
1. Iterate through possible subset sizes from largest to smallest
2. For each size, check all combinations of that size
3. Verify the condition that for any two distinct elements, (a-b) doesn't divide (a+b)
4. Return the first valid size found (which will be maximal since we're checking from largest)

```python
import itertools

def is_valid_subset(S):
    """Check if subset S satisfies the condition that for any a,b in S, a≠b ⇒ (a-b)∤(a+b)"""
    for a, b in itertools.combinations(S, 2):
        if (a + b) % (a - b) == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_max_subset(n_max):
    """Find maximum size of subset of [1..n_max] satisfying the condition"""
    for k in range(n_max, 0, -1):
        # Check combinations of size k until we find a valid one
        for S in itertools.combinations(range(1, n_max+1), k):
            if is_valid_subset(S):
                print(f"Found valid subset of size {k}: {S}")
                return k
        print(f"No subset of size {k} found")
    return 0

# Test with smaller ranges first to identify pattern
for n in [10, 20, 30]:
    print(f"\nTesting n_max = {n}")
    max_size = find_max_subset(n)
    print(f"Maximum subset size for n={n}: {max_size}")
```

The program tests smaller ranges first (n=10,20,30) to help identify a pattern. For each range, it checks subsets from largest to smallest size until it finds one that satisfies the condition. The output shows the valid subsets found and their sizes. This approach can be extended to larger ranges once the pattern is understood.
