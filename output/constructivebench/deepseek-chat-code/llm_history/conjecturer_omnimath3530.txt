noncomputable abbrev omnimath3530_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3530 (x : ℝ) : 
  x^3 < x^2 ↔ x ∈ omnimath3530_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing points where x^3 < x^2:
x = -2: True
x = -1: True
x = -0.5: True
x = 0.5: True
x = 0.9: True
x = 1: False
x = 1.1: False
x = 2: False

Based on testing, the inequality holds for:
x < 0 or 0 < x < 1. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
<<<{x | x < 0 ∨ 0 < x ∧ x < 1}>>>
