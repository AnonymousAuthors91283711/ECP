[write_program]
This problem involves finding the value of a polynomial P evaluated at n+1, given that P has degree n and satisfies P(k) = k/(k+1) for all integers k from 0 to n. We'll write a Python program to compute this for small values of n to identify a pattern.

The approach is:
1. For each small n, construct the polynomial P that interpolates the points (k, k/(k+1)) for k=0..n
2. Evaluate this polynomial at n+1
3. Observe the pattern in the results

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.polynomial import Polynomial

def compute_p(n):
    # Points to interpolate: (k, k/(k+1)) for k=0..n
    x_points = np.arange(n + 1)
    y_points = x_points / (x_points + 1.0)
    
    # Find polynomial coefficients that fit these points
    coeffs = np.polyfit(x_points, y_points, n)
    
    # Create polynomial and evaluate at n+1
    p = Polynomial(coeffs[::-1])  # Reverse because numpy uses opposite order
    return p(n + 1)

# Compute for small values of n
max_n = 10
print("n | P(n+1)")
print("--|-------")
for n in range(max_n + 1):
    result = compute_p(n)
    # Print exact fraction if possible (for small n)
    if n <= 4:  # Beyond n=4, floating point inaccuracies make exact fractions unreliable
        from fractions import Fraction
        exact = Fraction(result).limit_denominator()
        print(f"{n} | {exact.numerator}/{exact.denominator}")
    else:
        print(f"{n} | {result:.6f}")
```

The program computes the polynomial interpolation for each n up to 10 and evaluates it at n+1. For nâ‰¤4, it attempts to find an exact fractional representation, while for larger n it shows decimal approximations due to floating-point limitations. The output shows a clear pattern that can help conjecture the general formula.
