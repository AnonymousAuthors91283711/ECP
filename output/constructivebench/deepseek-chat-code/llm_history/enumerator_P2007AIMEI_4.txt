[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n that is a multiple of 60, 84, and 140. This is equivalent to finding the least common multiple (LCM) of these three numbers. The Python program will calculate the LCM by first finding the LCM of two numbers, then combining with the third.

```python
import math

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)

# Calculate LCM of 60, 84, and 140
lcm_60_84 = lcm(60, 84)
final_lcm = lcm(lcm_60_84, 140)

print(final_lcm)
```
