[write_program]
This problem asks for the sum of squares of the first 50 odd numbers modulo 1000. We'll compute this directly in Python by:
1. Generating the first 50 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ..., 99)
2. Squaring each number
3. Summing all squares
4. Taking modulo 1000 of the result

The program will compute and print the final answer directly since it's a single value calculation.

```python
def compute_sum_mod():
    total = 0
    for k in range(50):
        odd_num = 2 * k + 1
        total += odd_num * odd_num
    return total % 1000

result = compute_sum_mod()
print(result)
```
