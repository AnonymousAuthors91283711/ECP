Based on the problem statement, we need to find a pair (a, b) that satisfies the given equation for all real x. The equation can be rewritten as:
a*(x + b*(x + 3)) = 2*(x + 6)
which simplifies to:
a*(1 + b)*x + 3*a*b = 2x + 12

For this to hold for all x, the coefficients must match:
1. Coefficient of x: a*(1 + b) = 2
2. Constant term: 3*a*b = 12

Solving these equations:
From equation 2: a*b = 4
Substitute into equation 1: a + 4 = 2 ⇒ a = -2
Then b = 4/a = -2

The error in the original proposed answer (2/5, 4/3) was that it didn't satisfy both equations. The correct solution is (-2, -2).
