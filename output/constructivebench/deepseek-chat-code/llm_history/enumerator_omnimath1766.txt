[write_program]
This problem asks for the largest number of points in the plane such that any subset of 3 points contains at least one pair exactly 1 unit apart. We'll write a Python program to enumerate small cases and look for patterns.

The approach:
1. Generate small point sets systematically
2. Check the condition for all 3-point subsets
3. Track the maximum size found

```python
import itertools
import math

def check_condition(points):
    """Check if every 3-point subset has a pair exactly 1 unit apart"""
    for triplet in itertools.combinations(points, 3):
        has_pair = False
        for p1, p2 in itertools.combinations(triplet, 2):
            dx = p1[0] - p2[0]
            dy = p1[1] - p2[1]
            if math.isclose(math.hypot(dx, dy), 1, abs_tol=1e-9):
                has_pair = True
                break
        if not has_pair:
            return False
    return True

def generate_grid_points(size, spacing):
    """Generate points on a grid with given spacing"""
    points = []
    for x in range(size):
        for y in range(size):
            points.append((x * spacing, y * spacing))
    return points

def main():
    max_n = 0
    # Try different grid spacings that might produce unit distances
    for spacing in [0.5, 1.0, math.sqrt(3)/2, 1.0/math.sqrt(2)]:
        for size in range(2, 7):
            points = generate_grid_points(size, spacing)
            if len(points) <= max_n:
                continue
            if check_condition(points):
                print(f"Found set of size {len(points)} with spacing {spacing}")
                max_n = len(points)
    
    # Also check some known configurations
    # Equilateral triangle lattice
    equilateral = [(0,0), (1,0), (0.5, math.sqrt(3)/2)]
    if check_condition(equilateral):
        print(f"Equilateral triangle works (size 3)")
        if 3 > max_n:
            max_n = 3
    
    # Square grid
    square = [(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1)]
    if check_condition(square):
        print(f"Square works (size 4)")
        if 4 > max_n:
            max_n = 4
    
    print(f"Maximum size found: {max_n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
