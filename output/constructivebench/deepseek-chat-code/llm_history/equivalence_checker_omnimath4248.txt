Ground Truth Answer: {((1 : ℝ), x, 1/x) | x ≠ 0} ∪ {((-1 : ℝ), x, -1/x) | x ≠ 0} ∪ {((1 : ℝ), 1/x, x) | x ≠ 0} ∪ {((-1 : ℝ), -1/x, -x) | x ≠ 0} ∪ {((x : ℝ), 1/x, (-1 : ℝ)) | x ≠ 0} ∪ {((-x : ℝ), -1/x, 1) | x ≠ 0}
Proposed Answer: ({(-1, -1, -1), (1, 1, 1)} ∪ {(-2, -0.5, 1), (-1, 1, 1), (0.5, 2, 1)})
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all real triples (a,b,c) where:
   - a + b + c = 1/a + 1/b + 1/c
   - a² + b² + c² = 1/a² + 1/b² + 1/c²

2. The ground truth answer provides a comprehensive solution set with all possible permutations of forms where:
   - One element is ±1 and the other two are reciprocals (x, 1/x)
   - Or one element is ±1, another is x, and the third is -1/x (with appropriate sign patterns)

3. The proposed answer only lists specific points:
   - (1,1,1) and (-1,-1,-1) are valid solutions
   - The other points (-2,-0.5,1), (-1,1,1), (0.5,2,1) are indeed solutions but represent only a tiny subset of the infinite solution set described in the ground truth

The proposed answer is missing:
- All other reciprocal pairs with x ≠ ±1
- All permutations of the forms
- The negative counterparts
- The cases where one element is -1
