[write_program]
This problem asks to find all quadruples (a, b, p, n) where a and b are positive integers, p is prime, n is a positive integer, and a^2013 + b^2013 = p^n. The solution requires finding all such combinations where the sum of two 2013th powers equals a prime power.

We'll approach this by:
1. Considering small values of a and b since large exponents make the sum grow rapidly
2. Checking when the sum is a prime power
3. Special cases when a=1 or b=1 since these are most likely to yield prime powers
4. Considering p=2 since it's the smallest prime and most likely to appear

            return n == p
    d = n - 1
    s = 0
    while d % 2 == 0:
        d //= 2

            continue
        x = pow(a, d, n)

        if s == 1:
            continue
        # Check if s is a prime power
        max_possible_n = int(math.log(s, 2)) + 2
        for n in range(1, min(max_power, max_possible_n) + 1):
            # Find p such that p^n = s
            p = round(s ** (1/n))
