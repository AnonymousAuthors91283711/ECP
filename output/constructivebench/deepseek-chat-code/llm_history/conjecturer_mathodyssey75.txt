Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
Based on the pattern of enumerated values approaching ±√2/2 (approximately ±0.7071) and the problem's symmetry, the answer set should be the closed interval between these extremal values. The exact values are derived from optimization on the unit sphere.
