[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest base `b > 1` such that:
1. `1*b + 6` is prime (interpreted as number in base `b`)
2. There exists some integer `k` where `k^2 = 9*b + 7`

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of `b` and check these conditions. The program will:
1. Iterate through possible bases `b` starting from 2
2. For each `b`, check if `1*b + 6` is prime (interpreted in base 10)
3. Check if `9*b + 7` is a perfect square
4. Print any bases that satisfy both conditions
5. Stop after finding the smallest such base

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]:
        if n % p == 0:
            return n == p
    d = n - 1
    s = 0
    while d % 2 == 0:
        d //= 2
        s += 1
    for a in [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]:
        if a >= n:
            continue
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(s - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False
    return True

def is_perfect_square(n):
    root = math.isqrt(n)
    return root * root == n

b = 2
while True:
    # Check condition 1: 1*b + 6 is prime (interpreted in base 10)
    num = 1 * b + 6
    if is_prime(num):
        # Check condition 2: 9*b + 7 is perfect square
        expr = 9 * b + 7
        if is_perfect_square(expr):
            print(f"Found valid base: {b}")
            print(f"Smallest valid base is: {b}")
            break
    b += 1
```
