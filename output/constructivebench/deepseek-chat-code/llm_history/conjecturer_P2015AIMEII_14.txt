Looking at the problem and the proposed answer, I notice several issues:
1. The expression is missing parentheses for proper grouping
2. The exponents need to be properly formatted for real number operations
3. The pattern suggests the answer involves combinations of 3^(n/3) terms

The error occurs because the expression isn't properly parenthesized and formatted for Lean's real number operations. Based on the problem's symmetry and the exponents involved, the correct form should combine terms with exponents of 1/3, 2/3, and 4/3.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<2 * 3 ^ (1 / 3) + 3 ^ (4 / 3) + 2 * 3 ^ (2 / 3)>>>

Explanation:
1. The expression maintains the same mathematical structure but with proper Lean syntax
2. Each term is now properly parenthesized for exponentiation
3. The coefficients (2, 1, 2) match the pattern in the original problem's constraints
4. The exponents form a progression (1/3, 4/3, 2/3) that relates to the original equations' exponents (4,5,3,6) when considering substitution and simplification
