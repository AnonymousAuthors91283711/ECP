open Real

abbrev omnimath1380_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1380 (e f : ℝ) 
  (h1 : e / f = 3 / 4) 
  (h2 : sqrt (e^2 + f^2) = 15) 
  : e * f = omnimath1380_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: e = 9.0, f = 12, e*f = 108.0
e = -9.0, f = -12, e*f = 108.0

Final answer (exact): 108. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<108>>>
