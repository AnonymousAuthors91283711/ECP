abbrev omnimath3405_answer : ℤ → ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath3405 (x : ℤ) (h : Even (3 * x + 1)) : 
  Odd (omnimath3405_answer x) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 7 * x + 4
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℤ => x
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem asks for a function f(x) where if (3x+1) is even, then f(x) must be odd.

2. Ground truth: f(x) = 7x + 4
- For any integer x, 7x + 4 is odd (since 7x has same parity as x, and 4 is even, so 7x+4 has opposite parity of x)
- When 3x+1 is even, x must be odd (since 3x must be odd, which requires x odd)
- So when x is odd, 7x+4 is odd + even = odd, satisfying the condition

3. Proposed answer: f(x) = x
- This fails when x is even (f(x) would be even)
- But the condition requires f(x) to be odd whenever 3x+1 is even
- Counterexample: x=1 (3*1+1=4 even, f(1)=1 odd - works)
  x=3 (3*3+1=10 even, f(3)=3 odd - works)
  BUT the function must work for ALL x where 3x+1 is even, and fails when x is odd (which is actually correct for odd x, but the function is wrong for even x when the premise doesn't hold)
  
Wait, actually the condition is only about when 3x+1 is even, not all x. The proposed answer works when 3x+1 is even (since that forces x to be odd, making f(x)=x odd), but it's not the general solution.

The ground truth works for all x (always odd), while the proposed answer only works conditionally. They're not equivalent functions, but the proposed answer satisfies the theorem's condition.
