Ground Truth Answer: Real.sqrt 2
Proposed Answer: Real.sqrt 10
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal value of |α| + |γ| under certain complex function constraints.

2. The constraints involve a quadratic function (4 + i)z² + αz + γ evaluated at z=1 and z=i, with the imaginary part set to 0 in both cases.

3. The ground truth answer is √2 ≈ 1.414, while the proposed answer is √10 ≈ 3.162.

4. Let's verify the ground truth:
   - For z=1: Im[(4+i)(1)² + α(1) + γ] = 0 ⇒ 1 + Im(α) = 0
   - For z=i: Im[(4+i)(i)² + α(i) + γ] = 0 ⇒ -4 + Re(α) = 0
   - This gives α = 4 - i
   - Then γ is determined by the real part condition, and minimal |γ| occurs when γ is real
   - |α| = √(4² + 1²) = √17
   - But this seems too large, suggesting the ground truth might be incorrect

5. The proposed answer √10 seems more plausible:
   - With α = 4 - i (from above), |α| = √17
   - The minimal |γ| would be when γ compensates exactly for the real part
   - However, √10 is smaller than √17, suggesting a different solution path

Given that both answers seem potentially incorrect based on initial analysis, but the proposed answer is definitely not equal to the ground truth, the correct response is:

<<<False>>>
