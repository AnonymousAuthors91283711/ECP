[write_program]
This problem involves finding all positive real-valued functions f: ℝ⁺ → ℝ⁺ that satisfy a given functional equation. We'll write a Python program to enumerate potential solutions by testing simple forms like linear functions.

The functional equation is:
(z + 1) * f(x + y) = f(x * f(z) + y) + f(y * f(z) + x) for all x,y,z > 0
and f(x) > 0 for all x > 0

We'll test linear functions of the form f(x) = kx + c since they're simplest to analyze.

```python
def test_linear(k, c):
    """Test if f(x) = kx + c satisfies the functional equation."""
    # We'll test with specific x,y,z values to see if the equation holds
    test_values = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.5, 1.5]
    for x in test_values:
        for y in test_values:
            for z in test_values:
                lhs = (z + 1) * (k*(x + y) + c)
                term1 = k*(x*(k*z + c) + y) + c
                term2 = k*(y*(k*z + c) + x) + c
                rhs = term1 + term2
                if not abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-6:  # account for floating point errors
                    return False
    return True

def find_solutions():
    """Find potential solutions by testing linear forms."""
    # Test various k and c values
    for k in [0.1 * i for i in range(1, 21)]:
        for c in [0.1 * i for i in range(0, 11)]:
            if test_linear(k, c):
                print(f"Potential solution found: f(x) = {k}x + {c}")

    # Special case: c = 0
    print("\nTesting special case c = 0:")
    for k in [0.1 * i for i in range(1, 21)]:
        if test_linear(k, 0):
            print(f"Solution with c=0: f(x) = {k}x")

    # Special case: k = 1
    print("\nTesting special case k = 1:")
    for c in [0.1 * i for i in range(0, 11)]:
        if test_linear(1, c):
            print(f"Solution with k=1: f(x) = x + {c}")
