noncomputable abbrev omnimath4407_answer : ℝ → ℕ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath4407 (a : ℝ) (ha : 1 < a) :
  (∃ C, ∀ n, |omnimath4407_answer a n| ≤ C) ∧ 
  ∀ i j : ℕ, i ≠ j → |omnimath4407_answer a i - omnimath4407_answer a j| * |(i - j : ℝ)|^a ≥ 1 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 
Testing a = 1.5
linear function satisfies conditions for a=1.5
logarithmic function fails for a=1.5
power function fails for a=1.5

Testing a = 2.0
linear function satisfies conditions for a=2.0
logarithmic function fails for a=2.0
power function fails for a=2.0

Testing a = 2.5
linear function satisfies conditions for a=2.5
logarithmic function fails for a=2.5
power function fails for a=2.5. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℕ → ℝ
Based on the enumerated answers showing that a linear function satisfies the conditions for various values of a > 1, and the problem requiring both boundedness and a separation condition, the simplest solution is a linear function in n. The pattern suggests the answer is proportional to n.
