[write_program]
This problem is about finding natural numbers n > 2 where n! divides a product of sums of pairs of primes. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of n that satisfy this condition.

The approach:
1. Generate primes up to n using sieve
2. For each prime p, find all larger primes q and compute p+q
3. Compute the product of all these sums
4. Check if n! divides this product

We'll test small values of n first since factorials grow rapidly.

```python
import math
from itertools import combinations

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]:
        if n % p == 0:
            return n == p
    d = n - 1
    s = 0
    while d % 2 == 0:
        d //= 2
        s += 1
    for a in [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]:
        if a >= n:
            continue
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(s - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False
    return True

def primes_up_to(n):
    return [p for p in range(2, n+1) if is_prime(p)]

def compute_product(n):
    primes = primes_up_to(n)
    product = 1
    for i, p in enumerate(primes):
        for q in primes[i+1:]:
            product *= (p + q)
    return product

max_n = 20  # Test up to n=20 since factorials grow rapidly
for n in range(3, max_n + 1):
    product = compute_product(n)
    factorial = math.factorial(n)
    if product % factorial == 0:
        print(f"n = {n} satisfies the condition")
```
