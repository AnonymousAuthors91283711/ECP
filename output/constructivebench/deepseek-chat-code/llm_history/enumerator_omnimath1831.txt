[write_program]
This problem involves finding all complex triples (a, b, c) that satisfy the system of equations:
a² = b - c
b² = c - a
c² = a - b
and characterizing them through the sum a + b + c.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Find all possible sums a + b + c for small integer values
2. Look for patterns in the sums
3. Enumerate possible roots that might form the solution set

The approach will be to:
- Consider roots of unity since the equations have cyclic symmetry
- Check sums of roots and their combinations
- Look for exact values before approximations

```python
import cmath

def find_solutions():
    # We'll check roots of unity up to order 6
    for n in range(1, 7):
        print(f"\nChecking roots of unity order {n}:")
        for k in range(n):
            # Primitive root of unity
            omega = cmath.exp(2j * cmath.pi * k / n)
            # Check if it's a solution when a, b, c are powers of omega
            for p1 in range(n):
                for p2 in range(n):
                    for p3 in range(n):
                        a = omega ** p1
                        b = omega ** p2
                        c = omega ** p3
                        # Verify the equations
                        eq1 = abs(a**2 - (b - c)) < 1e-6
                        eq2 = abs(b**2 - (c - a)) < 1e-6
                        eq3 = abs(c**2 - (a - b)) < 1e-6
                        if eq1 and eq2 and eq3:
                            s = a + b + c
                            print(f"Found solution: a={a:.3f}, b={b:.3f}, c={c:.3f}, sum={s:.3f}")

    # Check specific cases where a=b=c
    print("\nChecking equal values case:")
    for x in [-0.5 + 0j, 0.5 + 0.866j, 0.5 - 0.866j]:
        a = b = c = x
        eq1 = abs(a**2 - (b - c)) < 1e-6
        if eq1:  # Other equations follow by symmetry
            s = a + b + c
            print(f"Equal values solution: a=b=c={x:.3f}, sum={s:.3f}")

    # Check zero sum case
    print("\nChecking zero sum case:")
    a = 1j
    b = -0.5 - 0.866j
    c = -0.5 + 0.866j
    eq1 = abs(a**2 - (b - c)) < 1e-6
    eq2 = abs(b**2 - (c - a)) < 1e-6
    eq3 = abs(c**2 - (a - b)) < 1e-6
