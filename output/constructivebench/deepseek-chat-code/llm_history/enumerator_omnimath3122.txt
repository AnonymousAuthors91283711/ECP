The problem asks for the number of natural numbers `n` such that `s(n) = 43 - 4n > 0`. We need to find all positive integers `n` where `43 - 4n > 0`. 

The solution involves solving the inequality `43 - 4n > 0` for natural numbers `n`. This simplifies to `n < 43/4`, or `n < 10.75`. Since `n` must be a natural number, the possible values are `n = 1, 2, ..., 10`.

Here's a Python program to enumerate and count these values:

```python
def count_positive_terms():
    count = 0
    for n in range(1, 100):  # Arbitrarily large upper bound
        if 43 - 4 * n > 0:
            print(f"n = {n} satisfies s(n) > 0")
            count += 1
        else:
            break  # No need to check larger n since s(n) decreases
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

count_positive_terms()
```

The program will output each valid `n` and then the total count, which is 10. The loop breaks early when `s(n)` becomes non-positive since the function is strictly decreasing.
