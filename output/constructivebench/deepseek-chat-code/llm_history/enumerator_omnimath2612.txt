This problem asks for the number of pairs of subsets (S,T) of a 10-element set where the union SâˆªT has exactly 3 elements. We'll enumerate all possible cases by considering different ways the union can have 3 elements.

The approach:
1. First choose 3 elements for the union (10 choose 3 ways)
2. For each element in the union, it can be:
   - Only in S
   - Only in T
   - In both S and T
This gives 3 choices per element, so 3^3 total configurations for each selected triplet.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def count_pairs():
    n = 10  # size of the base set
    k = 3   # size of the union
    total = 0
    
    # All possible ways to choose the 3 elements in the union
    for union_elements in combinations(range(n), k):
        # For each of the 3 elements, it can be in S only, T only, or both
        # So 3 options per element, total 3^3 = 27 configurations
        total += 3 ** k
    
    print(total)

count_pairs()
```

The program calculates the count by:
1. Generating all combinations of 3 elements from 10 (for the union)
2. For each combination, counting the 27 possible ways to distribute the elements between S and T
3. Summing all these possibilities

The output will be the total count of such pairs (S,T). The mathematical formula is C(10,3)*3^3 = 120*27 = 3240.

Note: The original problem was stated in Lean theorem prover syntax, but we've implemented a Python solution to compute the answer through enumeration.
