This problem involves counting the number of periodic Boolean functions (â„¤ â†’ Bool) with period 7 that satisfy a specific non-repetition condition. The condition states that there should be no integer k where c(k) = c(k+1) AND c(2k) = c(k).

We'll approach this by:
1. Considering all possible 7-length patterns (since the function is periodic with period 7)
2. Filtering out patterns that violate the non-repetition condition
3. Counting the valid patterns

The program will enumerate all possible 7-bit patterns (128 possibilities) and check the condition for each.

```python
def is_valid_pattern(pattern):
    # Check if pattern satisfies the condition for all k modulo 7
    for k in range(7):
        # Check c(k) == c(k+1) and c(2k) == c(k)
        if pattern[k] == pattern[(k+1)%7] and pattern[(2*k)%7] == pattern[k]:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    count = 0
    # Iterate all possible 7-bit patterns (0-127)
    for i in range(128):
        # Convert number to 7-bit pattern (list of bools)
        pattern = [bool((i >> bit) & 1) for bit in range(7)]
        if is_valid_pattern(pattern):
            count += 1
            print(f"Valid pattern found: {pattern}")
    print(f"Total valid patterns: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
