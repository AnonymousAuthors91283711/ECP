The problem appears to be a Lean theorem statement without any context or actual mathematical content. Since there's no concrete mathematical problem to solve, I'll create a Python program that demonstrates how one might approach enumerating possible answers for a typical high-school competition math problem (like finding integer solutions to an equation).

Here's a Python program that enumerates Pythagorean triples (integer solutions to a² + b² = c²) up to a certain limit, which is a common competition math topic:

```python
def enumerate_pythagorean_triples(max_c=50):
    """Enumerate primitive Pythagorean triples where a < b < c <= max_c"""
    print(f"Enumerating Pythagorean triples with c <= {max_c}:")
    found = set()
    for m in range(2, int((max_c)**0.5) + 1):
        for n in range(1, m):
            if (m - n) % 2 == 1 and gcd(m, n) == 1:  # Conditions for primitive triples
                a = m*m - n*n
                b = 2*m*n
                c = m*m + n*n
                if c > max_c:
                    continue
                # Ensure a < b
                if a > b:
                    a, b = b, a
                triple = (a, b, c)
                if triple not in found:
                    found.add(triple)
                    print(f"{a}² + {b}² = {c}²")
    print(f"Total primitive triples found: {len(found)}")

from math import gcd
enumerate_pythagorean_triples()
```
