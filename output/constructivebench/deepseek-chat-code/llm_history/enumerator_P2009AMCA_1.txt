This problem involves finding the sum of hours (h) and minutes (m) given a time difference equation. The equation states that a time of h hours and m minutes equals the difference between 1:18 and 10:34. We'll calculate this difference and find h and m values that satisfy the equation, then compute their sum.

```python
def calculate_time_difference():
    # Convert times to total minutes
    time1 = 1 * 60 + 18  # 1:18
    time2 = 10 * 60 + 34  # 10:34
    difference = time1 - time2
    
    # Since time1 is earlier than time2, difference is negative
    # We need to represent this as positive hours and minutes
    total_minutes = -difference
    h = total_minutes // 60
    m = total_minutes % 60
    
    # Verify the solution
    assert h * 60 + m == total_minutes
    assert 0 < m < 60
    
    return h + m

# Calculate and print the answer
print(calculate_time_difference())
```
