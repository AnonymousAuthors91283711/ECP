The problem involves calculating the ratio of two probabilities related to permutations of 26 elements. The first probability p1 involves a cycle structure with one 3-cycle and the rest fixed points, while p2 involves one 2-cycle and the rest fixed points. We need to compute p1/p2.

Here's a Python program that calculates this ratio exactly using exact rational arithmetic (via fractions.Fraction) to avoid floating-point inaccuracies:

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from math import factorial

def calculate_ratio():
    # Calculate p1 = (24 * 22! * 3!) / 26!
    p1_numerator = 24 * factorial(22) * factorial(3)
    p1_denominator = factorial(26)
    p1 = Fraction(p1_numerator, p1_denominator)
    
    # Calculate p2 = (23 * 23! * 2!) / 26!
    p2_numerator = 23 * factorial(23) * factorial(2)
    p2_denominator = factorial(26)
    p2 = Fraction(p2_numerator, p2_denominator)
    
    # Compute and return the ratio p1/p2
    ratio = p1 / p2
    return ratio

# Compute and print the exact ratio
exact_ratio = calculate_ratio()
print(f"Exact ratio: {exact_ratio}")
print(f"Decimal approximation: {float(exact_ratio)}")
```

The program calculates the exact rational value of p1/p2 by:
1. Computing the exact values of p1 and p2 using factorial calculations
2. Using Python's fractions module to maintain exact rational arithmetic
3. Printing both the exact fraction and its decimal approximation

The output will show the exact ratio in fractional form and its decimal approximation, which helps in understanding the relationship between these two permutation probabilities.
