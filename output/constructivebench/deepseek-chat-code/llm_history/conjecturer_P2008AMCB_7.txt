abbrev P2008AMCB_7_answer : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem P2008AMCB_7 (x y : ℝ) :
    ((x - y)^2 - (y - x)^2)^2 = P2008AMCB_7_answer x y := by sorry. Enumerated answers: For x=0, y=0: result=0
For x=1, y=0: result=0
For x=0, y=1: result=0
For x=1, y=1: result=0
For x=2, y=3: result=0
For x=-1, y=1: result=0
For x=1.5, y=2.5: result=0.0
For x=100, y=-100: result=0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
Looking at the enumerated answers, we can observe that the result is always 0 regardless of the input values x and y. The expression ((x - y)^2 - (y - x)^2) simplifies to 0 since (x-y)^2 = (y-x)^2 for all real numbers. Therefore, the answer is the constant zero function.
