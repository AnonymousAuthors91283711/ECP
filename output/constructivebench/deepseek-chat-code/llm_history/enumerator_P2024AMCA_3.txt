The problem asks for the smallest number k such that there exists a multiset of natural numbers between 10 and 99 (inclusive) that sums to 2024 with exactly k elements. We need to find the minimal k.

To solve this, we'll:
1. Find the minimal k by considering the maximal possible elements (99) first
2. Then adjust with smaller numbers to reach exactly 2024
3. Enumerate possible k values starting from the theoretical minimum

```python
def find_min_k():
    # Calculate theoretical bounds
    min_possible = (2024 + 98) // 99  # ceil(2024/99)
    max_possible = 2024 // 10          # floor(2024/10)
    
    print(f"Testing k from {min_possible} to {max_possible}")
    
    for k in range(min_possible, max_possible + 1):
        # Check if 2024 is between min and max possible sums for k elements
        min_sum = 10 * k
        max_sum = 99 * k
        if min_sum <= 2024 <= max_sum:
            # Check if we can reach exactly 2024
            # The difference between max_sum and 2024 must be <= 89*k
            # because we can replace 99s with 10s (difference of 89 each)
            if (max_sum - 2024) <= 89 * k:
                print(f"Possible with k = {k}")
                # Found minimal k since we're checking in order
                print(f"Minimal k found: {k}")
                return
    
    print("No solution found")

find_min_k()
```
