This problem involves finding the height of a stack of logs after half the total time has passed. The logs are stacked in a triangular formation where each layer takes 10*(k+1) seconds to place, with k ranging from 0 to 118 (119 layers total). We need to find the height remaining after half the total time has elapsed.

The approach is:
1. Calculate total time (sum of 10*(k+1) for k=0 to 118)
2. Find half of this total time
3. Determine how many complete layers can be placed in this half-time
4. The remaining height is 119 minus this number of complete layers
5. Multiply by 10 to get the final answer

```python
def main():
    # Calculate total time (sum of 10*(k+1) for k=0 to 118)
    total_time = sum(10 * (k + 1) for k in range(119))
    half_time = total_time // 2
    
    # Find how many complete layers can be placed in half_time
    cumulative_time = 0
    layers_completed = 0
    for k in range(119):
        layer_time = 10 * (k + 1)
        if cumulative_time + layer_time > half_time:
            break
        cumulative_time += layer_time
        layers_completed += 1
    
    # Calculate remaining height and final answer
    remaining_height = 119 - layers_completed
    answer = 10 * remaining_height
    print(answer)

    main()
