theorem omnimath3149 : 
  omnimath3149_answer (3, 1) (4, 2) = 14 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing operations for (3,1) and (4,2):
Operation 4 yields 14: <lambda>. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ → ℕ × ℕ → ℕ
Based on the enumerated answer showing that operation 4 yields 14 for inputs (3,1) and (4,2), and looking for a simple pattern that matches this result, the most likely operation is the dot product of the pairs. For (a,b) and (c,d), this would be a*c + b*d. For (3,1) and (4,2): 3*4 + 1*2 = 12 + 2 = 14.
