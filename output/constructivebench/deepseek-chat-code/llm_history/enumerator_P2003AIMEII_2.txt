[write_program]
This problem asks for the largest number divisible by 8 with all distinct digits. We'll write a Python program to find this number by checking numbers in descending order from 9876543210 (the largest 10-digit number with all distinct digits) down to 0, and print numbers that meet both criteria (divisible by 8 and all distinct digits). Once we find the first such number, we'll output it as the solution.

```python
def has_distinct_digits(n):
    s = str(n)
    return len(s) == len(set(s))

def find_largest_distinct_digit_multiple_of_8():
    # Start from the largest possible number with distinct digits
    max_num = 9876543210
    # We'll check numbers in descending order
    for n in range(max_num, -1, -1):
        if n % 8 == 0 and has_distinct_digits(n):
            print(f"Found valid number: {n}")
            print(f"Last three digits: {n % 1000}")
            return
    print("No valid number found")

find_largest_distinct_digit_multiple_of_8()
```
