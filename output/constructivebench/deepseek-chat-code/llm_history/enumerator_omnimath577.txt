[write_program]
This problem involves finding real triples (x, y, z) that satisfy three equations:
1. x²y + y²z = 1040
2. x²z + z²y = 260
3. (x-y)(y-z)(z-x) = -540

We'll search for integer solutions first, then consider rationals if needed. The program will enumerate possible integer values for x, y, z within a reasonable range and check the equations.

```python
def main():
    # Search range - adjust if needed
    min_val = -20
    max_val = 20
    
    found = False
    for x in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
        for y in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
            for z in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
                if x == y or y == z or z == x:  # Skip cases where denominator would be zero
                    continue
                
                eq1 = x**2 * y + y**2 * z == 1040
                eq2 = x**2 * z + z**2 * y == 260
                eq3 = (x - y) * (y - z) * (z - x) == -540
                
                if eq1 and eq2 and eq3:
                    print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")
                    found = True
    
    if not found:
        print("No integer solutions found in the searched range.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
