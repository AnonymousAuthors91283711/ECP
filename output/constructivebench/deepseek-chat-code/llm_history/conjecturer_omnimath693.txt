Final answer: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern in the enumerated answers, we can see that the results cycle through 78, 58, 78, 98, 18, 38, 58, 78, 98, 18, etc., but the final operation with 9 results in 0. Since the problem asks for the modulo 100 result after processing all numbers including 9, the answer is consistently 0.
