[write_program]
This problem involves finding complex numbers z such that z, f(z), and f(f(z)) form a right triangle, with z having a specific form. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible solutions by checking small integer values for m and n.

The approach:
1. Iterate over possible integer values for m (positive integers)
2. For each m, iterate over possible integer values for n (positive integers)
3. Construct z in the form m + sqrt(n) + 11i
4. Compute f(z) and f(f(z))
5. Check if the three points form a right triangle using the distance condition
6. Print valid (m,n) pairs when found

```python
import math
import cmath

def f(z):
    return z**2 - 19*z

def is_right_triangle(a, b, c):
    # Calculate squared distances between points
    d1_sq = abs(a - b)**2
    d2_sq = abs(b - c)**2
    d3_sq = abs(a - c)**2
    
    # Check Pythagorean theorem in all possible configurations
    return (math.isclose(d1_sq + d2_sq, d3_sq) or
            math.isclose(d1_sq + d3_sq, d2_sq) or
            math.isclose(d2_sq + d3_sq, d1_sq))

def main():
    # Search reasonable bounds for m and n
    for m in range(1, 20):
        for n in range(1, 1000):
            try:
                sqrt_n = math.sqrt(n)
                z = complex(m + sqrt_n, 11)
                fz = f(z)
                ffz = f(fz)
                
                if is_right_triangle(z, fz, ffz):
                    print(f"Found solution: m={m}, n={n}")
            except (OverflowError, ValueError):
                continue

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
