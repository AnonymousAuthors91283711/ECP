[write_program]
This problem asks to verify an inequality involving four non-negative real numbers summing to 4. We'll write a program to test various cases and patterns to understand when equality might hold.

The approach:
1. Test symmetric cases where variables are equal (all 1)
2. Test boundary cases where some variables are 0
3. Test cases with one variable dominant and others small
4. Output the maximum value found

```python
def f(x):
    return x / (x**3 + 8) if x != 0 else 0

# Test symmetric case
a = b = c = d = 1
print(f"All equal to 1: sum = {4*f(1)}")

# Test cases with some zeros
for zeros in [1, 2, 3]:
    non_zero = 4 - zeros
    val = 4 / non_zero
    s = zeros * f(0) + non_zero * f(val)
    print(f"{zeros} zeros, others equal {val}: sum = {s}")

# Test cases with one large value
for large in [3.5, 3.9, 3.99, 4]:
    small = (4 - large) / 3
    s = f(large) + 3*f(small)
    print(f"One large {large}, three small {small}: sum = {s}")

# Test random combinations (simplified)
import random
max_sum = 0
for _ in range(1000):
    a = random.uniform(0, 4)
    b = random.uniform(0, 4 - a)
    c = random.uniform(0, 4 - a - b)
    d = 4 - a - b - c
    current = f(a) + f(b) + f(c) + f(d)
    if current > max_sum:
        max_sum = current
        print(f"New max {max_sum} at ({a:.2f}, {b:.2f}, {c:.2f}, {d:.2f})")

print(f"Maximum sum found: {max_sum}")
```
