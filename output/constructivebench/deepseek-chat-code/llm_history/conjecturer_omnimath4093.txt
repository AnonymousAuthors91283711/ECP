theorem omnimath4093
: {f : ℕ → ℕ | ∀ x y : ℕ, x > 0 → y > 0 → GCDMonoid.gcd (f x) y * f (x * y) = f x * f y} = omnimath4093_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing constant functions:
Constant function f(n) = 0 works
Constant function f(n) = 1 works

Testing power functions:
Power function f(n) = n^0 works
Zero function f(n) = 0 works. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ → ℕ)
<<<{f | ∃ k : ℕ, f = fun n => n^k} ∪ {fun _ => 0, fun _ => 1}>>>
