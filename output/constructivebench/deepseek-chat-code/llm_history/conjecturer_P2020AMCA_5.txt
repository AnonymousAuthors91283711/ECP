From the problem statement and enumeration hints, we're looking for a magic square constant S for a 5×5 matrix with distinct integer entries in [-10,14]. The magic square condition requires all rows, columns, and diagonals to sum to S. For a 5×5 magic square with consecutive distinct integers, the magic constant is typically the middle value multiplied by 5. The range [-10,14] has 25 integers, so the middle value is 2.
