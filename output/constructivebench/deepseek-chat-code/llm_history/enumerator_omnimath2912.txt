[write_program]
The problem asks for the maximum natural number `s` that can be expressed as a sum `x + y` where `x` and `y` are part of a sequence of 9 numbers with specific constraints. The sequence values must be from the set {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13}, the sequence must be injective, and must satisfy certain recurrence relations.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible valid sequences and find the maximum `x + y` (where `x = f[0]` and `y = f[8]`).

```python
from itertools import permutations

def solve():
    allowed = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13}
    max_sum = 0
    
    # We'll iterate through all possible 9-element permutations of the allowed numbers
    # Since the sequence must be injective and use only allowed numbers
    for seq in permutations(allowed, 9):
        f = seq
        # Check the recurrence relations
        if (f[1] == f[0] + f[2] and
            f[3] == f[2] + f[4] and
            f[5] == f[4] + f[6] and
            f[7] == f[6] + f[8]):
            current_sum = f[0] + f[8]
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                print(f"New max sum found: {max_sum} with sequence {f}")
    
    print(f"Final maximum sum: {max_sum}")

solve()
```

Note: This brute-force approach checks all permutations, which is computationally expensive (9! = 362880 permutations). For a more efficient solution, we could implement backtracking with the recurrence constraints to prune invalid sequences early. However, given the problem size is manageable, this approach will work. The program will output intermediate results as it finds them, and finally print the maximum sum found.
