[write_program]
The problem asks for a natural number that cannot be expressed as a product of two integers greater than 1 (i.e., it's not a composite number), while several other numbers (6, 27, 39, 77) can be expressed this way. This suggests we're looking for a prime number. The program will enumerate primes and check if they satisfy the condition.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n in (2, 3):
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for d in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % d == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Check numbers up to 100 (can be increased if needed)
for n in range(2, 101):
    if is_prime(n):
        print(n)
```
