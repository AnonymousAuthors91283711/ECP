The problem asks to count how many numbers k between 1 and 2013 satisfy k^k ≡ 1 mod 10. We need to find the last digit of k^k being 1. 

Key observations:
1. The last digit of k^k depends only on k mod 10 and the exponent modulo the Carmichael function λ(10)=4
2. For each possible last digit d (0-9), we can determine when d^k ≡ 1 mod 10
3. We'll enumerate possible k values and count matches

Here's a Python program to count these numbers:

```python
def count_matching_numbers(max_k):
    count = 0
    for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
        last_digit = k % 10
        exponent = k % 4 if k % 4 != 0 else 4  # Handle cyclic pattern
        
        # Check when last_digit^exponent ends with 1
        if (last_digit == 1 or 
            (last_digit == 3 and exponent in [1, 3]) or
            (last_digit == 7 and exponent in [1, 3]) or
            (last_digit == 9 and exponent % 2 == 1)):
            count += 1
            print(f"Found match at k={k}")  # Stream partial results
    return count

max_k = 2013
print(f"Counting numbers 1-{max_k} where k^k ends with 1:")
total = count_matching_numbers(max_k)
print(f"Total count: {total}")
```

The program:
1. Iterates through numbers 1 to 2013
2. For each k, checks if k^k mod 10 would be 1 based on last digit and exponent
3. Prints each matching k as found (streaming)
4. Finally prints the total count

The mathematical patterns used:
- Numbers ending with 1 always satisfy 1^k ≡ 1
- Numbers ending with 3,7,9 satisfy when exponent is odd (since 3^1≡3, 3^3≡7, etc.)
- Other digits never produce 1 as last digit in k^k
