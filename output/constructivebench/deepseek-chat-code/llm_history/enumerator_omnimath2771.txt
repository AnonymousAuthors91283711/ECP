This problem is a simple algebraic equation where we need to evaluate the expression -(5x - 6x) when x = 3. The solution involves basic arithmetic operations. We'll write a Python program that calculates this expression for x=3 and prints the result.

```python
# Calculate -(5x - 6x) for x=3
x = 3
result = -(5 * x - 6 * x)
print(result)
```
