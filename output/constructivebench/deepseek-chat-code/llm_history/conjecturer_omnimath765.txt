Alphabet size 2: max triples = 4
Alphabet size 3: max triples = 18
Alphabet size 4: max triples = 48
Alphabet size 5: max triples = 100

For alphabet size 16, maximum triples = 3840. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern from the enumerated answers:
1: 0 = 0*(1-1)^2
2: 4 = 2*(2-1)^2
3: 18 = 3*(3-1)^2
4: 48 = 4*(4-1)^2
5: 100 = 5*(5-1)^2

The pattern suggests the formula is n*(n-1)^2 where n is alphabet size. For n=16: 16*15^2=3600, but the given answer is 3840. This suggests the formula might be n*(n^2-1) when n is even (16*255=4080 doesn't match). 

However, 3840 = 16*15*16, which suggests n*(n-1)*k where k grows with n. The correct pattern appears to be n*(n-1)*(n-1) for odd n and n*(n-1)*n for even n.

Final answer:
<<<fun n : ℕ => if n % 2 = 0 then n * (n - 1) * n else n * (n - 1) * (n - 1)>>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

. Enumerated Answers: Alphabet size 1: max triples = 0
Alphabet size 2: max triples = 4
Alphabet size 3: max triples = 18
Alphabet size 4: max triples = 48
Alphabet size 5: max triples = 100

For alphabet size 16, maximum triples = 3840. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the enumerated answers and the problem statement, we can observe a pattern:
- For n=1: 0 = 1*(1-1)*0
- For n=2: 4 = 2*(2-1)*2
- For n=3: 18 = 3*(3-1)*3
- For n=4: 48 = 4*(4-1)*4
- For n=5: 100 = 5*(5-1)*5

The pattern suggests the formula is n*(n-1)*n = n²*(n-1) for all n ≥ 1. The error in the original proposal was trying to make a function when we need a specific value (for n=16).

For alphabet size 16, the maximum number of triples should be 16²*(16-1) = 16*16*15 = 3840, which matches the enumerated answer.

<<<3840>>>
