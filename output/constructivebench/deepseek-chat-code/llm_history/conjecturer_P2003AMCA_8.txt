theorem P2003AMCA_8 :
  let factors := {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ n ∣ 60}
  let favorable := {n ∈ factors | n < 7}
  (Set.ncard favorable : ℚ) / Set.ncard factors = P2003AMCA_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: All divisors of 60: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60]
Divisors < 7: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Probability: 6/12 = 0.5. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
