Looking at the enumerated answers and the proposed solution pattern, we can see that:
1. (-1, -1) fits both patterns (k=-1 in first set, k=0 in second set)
2. (8, -10) fits the second pattern with k=9 (8+1=9, -9=-9)
3. (9, -6) fits the second pattern with k=7 (9+1=10, -10=-10)

The error in Lean comes from incorrect set builder notation syntax. In Lean, we need to use `setOf` for defining sets with conditions. Here's the corrected version:

<<<setOf (fun (m, n) => ∃ (k : ℤ), (n = -1 ∧ m = k) ∨ (n = -k ∧ m = k + 1))>>>

Explanation:
1. The first part `(n = -1 ∧ m = k)` captures all pairs where n=-1 and m is any integer
2. The second part `(n = -k ∧ m = k + 1)` captures pairs where m=k+1 and n=-k
3. We use `setOf` with a lambda function to properly construct the set
4. The existential quantifier `∃ (k : ℤ)` allows k to range over all integers

This matches both the enumerated solutions and the original proposed pattern while being syntactically correct in Lean.
