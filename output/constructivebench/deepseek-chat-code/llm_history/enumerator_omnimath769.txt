This problem involves finding all possible values of the expression `4*a0 + 2*a1 + a2` given certain constraints on a periodic binary sequence `a`. The sequence has period 60 and satisfies a specific recurrence relation modulo 2. We'll enumerate all possible binary sequences of length 60 that satisfy the constraints and compute the target expression.

```python
def main():
    # Since the sequence is periodic with period 60, we can represent it as a list of 60 bits
    # We'll try all possible combinations for a0, a1, then determine the rest via the recurrence
    results = set()
    
    for a0 in [0, 1]:
        for a1 in [0, 1]:
            # Initialize the sequence with a0 and a1
            seq = [0] * 60
            seq[0] = a0
            seq[1] = a1
            
            # Build the sequence using the recurrence relation
            valid = True
            for n in range(60):
                # Calculate a_{n+1} using the relation b(n) ≡ a(n-1) + a(n) + a(n+1) mod 2
                # Where b(n) = 1 if n ≡ 0 mod 3, else 0
                bn = 1 if n % 3 == 0 else 0
                prev = seq[(n-1) % 60]
                curr = seq[n % 60]
                
                # Solve for next term: next ≡ bn - prev - curr mod 2
                next_term = (bn - prev - curr) % 2
                
                # Check if we're overwriting a previously set value
                existing = seq[(n+1) % 60]
                if existing != 0 and existing != next_term:
                    valid = False
                    break
                seq[(n+1) % 60] = next_term
            
            # Also need to satisfy a(-1) = a(59) and a(0) = a(60) (which is a(0))
            if valid and seq[-1] == seq[59]:
                # Calculate the target expression
                a2 = seq[2]
                value = 4*a0 + 2*a1 + a2
                results.add(value)
                print(value)
    
    print("Possible values:", sorted(results))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
