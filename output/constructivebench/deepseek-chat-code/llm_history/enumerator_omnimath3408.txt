This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n that is a perfect square and divisible by 2023. We need to find the minimal n = k² where 2023 divides n.

Approach:
1. Factorize 2023 to understand its prime components (2023 = 7 × 17²)
2. For n to be divisible by 2023 and a perfect square, k must contain all prime factors of 2027 with at least half the exponents (rounded up)
3. The minimal k would be 7 × 17 = 119, giving n = 119² = 14161

The Python program will verify this by checking perfect squares in order until finding the smallest one divisible by 2023.

```python
def find_min_square_divisible_by(m):
    """Find smallest n = k^2 where m divides n"""
    k = 1
    while True:
        n = k * k
        if n % m == 0:
            print(f"Found: k={k}, n={n}")
            return n
        k += 1

# Factorize 2023 = 7 × 17 × 17
print("Searching for minimal n = k² divisible by 2023...")
result = find_min_square_divisible_by(2023)
print(f"Minimal solution: n = {result}")
```
