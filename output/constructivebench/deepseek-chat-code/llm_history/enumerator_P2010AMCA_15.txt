[write_program]
This problem involves finding the value of p (between 0 and 1/2) that satisfies the equation (6 choose 2) * p² * (1-p)² = 1/6. We'll write a Python program to numerically approximate the solution by testing values of p in small increments within the valid range.

The program will:
1. Iterate through possible p values from 0.001 to 0.499 in small steps
2. Calculate the left-hand side of the equation for each p
3. Check how close it is to 1/6 (0.166666...)
4. Print candidate p values that give results close to the target

```python
def main():
    target = 1/6
    best_p = 0
    best_diff = float('inf')
    
    # 6 choose 2 is 15
    for p in [i * 0.0001 for i in range(1, 5000)]:
        lhs = 15 * (p ** 2) * ((1 - p) ** 2)
        diff = abs(lhs - target)
        
        # Print candidates that are very close
        if diff < 0.0001:
            print(f"p = {p:.6f}, LHS = {lhs:.6f}, diff = {diff:.6f}")
            
        # Track the best candidate
        if diff < best_diff:
            best_diff = diff
            best_p = p
    
    print(f"\nBest candidate: p = {best_p:.6f} (difference = {best_diff:.6f})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
