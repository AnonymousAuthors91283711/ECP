[write_program]
The problem asks to compute the sum of sin^6 terms for angles from π/180 to 89π/180 radians (1° to 89°). We'll write a Python program to compute this sum exactly as a fraction by:

1. Using exact symbolic computation via sympy
2. Summing sin^6 terms for each angle
3. Simplifying the resulting expression
4. Finding the exact rational form

The program will compute the sum symbolically and output the numerator and denominator of the simplified fraction.

```python
import sympy as sp

def compute_sum():
    pi = sp.pi
    total = sp.Integer(0)
    # Compute sum from k=0 to 88 (1° to 89°)
    for k in range(89):
        angle = pi * (k + 1) / 180
        term = sp.sin(angle)**6
        total += term
    # Simplify the exact expression
    simplified = sp.simplify(total)
    # Convert to exact rational if possible
    if simplified.is_rational:
        frac = sp.nsimplify(simplified)
        print(f"Numerator: {frac.p}")
        print(f"Denominator: {frac.q}")
    else:
        print("Exact rational form not found")
        print(f"Approximate value: {float(simplified)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_sum()
```
