<<<fun n : ℕ => n^4 - n + 1>>> 

Explanation: The problem resembles a generalized pigeonhole principle where we need the maximum number of guests (m) such that no n guests share all four properties (s,d,w,c). The answer follows the pattern of n^4 - n + 1, which is common in such extremal problems where we subtract the constraint size (n) and add 1.
