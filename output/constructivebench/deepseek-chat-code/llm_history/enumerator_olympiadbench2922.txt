This problem asks for the product A*R*M*L given the constraints A² + R² = 20 and M² + L² = 10, with all variables positive integers. We'll enumerate all possible integer solutions to these equations and compute their products.

```python
def find_products():
    # First find all (A,R) pairs where A² + R² = 20 and A,R positive integers
    ar_pairs = []
    for a in range(1, int((20)**0.5) + 1):
        r_squared = 20 - a*a
        if r_squared <= 0:
            continue
        r = int(r_squared**0.5)
        if r*r == r_squared and r > 0:
            ar_pairs.append((a, r))
    
    # Find all (M,L) pairs where M² + L² = 10 and M,L positive integers
    ml_pairs = []
    for m in range(1, int((10)**0.5) + 1):
        l_squared = 10 - m*m
        if l_squared <= 0:
            continue
        l = int(l_squared**0.5)
        if l*l == l_squared and l > 0:
            ml_pairs.append((m, l))
    
    # Compute all possible products
    products = []
    for a, r in ar_pairs:
        for m, l in ml_pairs:
            products.append(a * r * m * l)
    
    # Remove duplicates and sort
    unique_products = sorted(list(set(products)))
    
    # Print all found products
    for p in unique_products:
        print(p)
    
    # The problem expects a single answer, so we'll print the maximum (though all should be equal)
    if unique_products:
        print("Final answer:", unique_products[0])

find_products()
```
