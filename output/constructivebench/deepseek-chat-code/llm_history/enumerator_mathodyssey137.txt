[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that for any function f from {1,...,n} to {1,...,17} with f(i) > 0 for all i, there exist x > y where 118x ≤ 119y and f(x) = f(y). We'll write a Python program to search for this minimal n by testing possible values.

The approach:
1. For each candidate n starting from 1 upwards
2. Generate all possible functions f:{1..n}→{1..17} with f(i)>0
3. Check if any such function violates the condition (no x,y satisfy the constraints)
4. The smallest n where no violations exist is our answer

Since exhaustive enumeration is impractical for larger n, we'll implement a smarter search that stops at the first valid n.

```python
def find_min_n():
    # We'll use a recursive approach with memoization to check all functions
    # But for efficiency, we'll implement a smarter search that checks the worst case
    
    # The key insight is that we need to find when any coloring must have two points
    # x > y with 118x <= 119y (i.e., y >= 118/119 x) that share the same color
    
    # We can model this using the pigeonhole principle with restricted distances
    
    for n in range(1, 100):  # Reasonable upper bound
        # The worst case is when we maximize distinct colors while avoiding the condition
        # We need to check if we can assign colors to 1..n avoiding same colors at x,y with y >= 118x/119
        
        # The maximal such sequence would have each new color at positions that grow by factor > 119/118
        max_colors = 0
        last = 0
        ratio = 119/118
        
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if i == 1 or i > last * ratio:
                max_colors += 1
                last = i
                if max_colors > 17:
                    break
        
        if max_colors <= 17:
            # Found the minimal n where no coloring with >17 colors exists
            print(f"Testing n = {n}: condition holds")
            return n
        else:
            print(f"Testing n = {n}: condition fails")
    
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = find_min_n()
    print(f"Minimal n found: {result}")
```
