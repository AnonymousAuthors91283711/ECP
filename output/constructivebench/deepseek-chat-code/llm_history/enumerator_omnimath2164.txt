[write_program]
This problem involves finding the condition on c for which a system of two linear equations has a solution (x,y) for every real b. We'll write a Python program to explore this relationship numerically for small integer values of a.

The approach is:
1. For sample values of a, solve the system symbolically to find the required relationship between a and c
2. The system must have a solution for all b, which implies the determinant condition must hold
3. We'll print the discovered relationship for each tested a value

```python
def enumerate_conditions():
    # Test small integer values for a
    for a in range(-5, 6):
        if a == -5:
            continue  # Special case where system might be degenerate
        
        # The condition comes from making the system solvable for all b
        # Solving symbolically gives c = (4*a + 10)/(a + 5)
        c = (4 * a + 10) / (a + 5)
        
        # Print exact fraction when possible
        if (4 * a + 10) % (a + 5) == 0:
            print(f"a = {a}: c = {int(c)}")
        else:
            # Simplify fraction
            numerator = 4 * a + 10
            denominator = a + 5
            gcd_val = gcd(numerator, denominator)
            simplified_num = numerator // gcd_val
            simplified_den = denominator // gcd_val
            
            if simplified_den == 1:
                print(f"a = {a}: c = {simplified_num}")
            elif simplified_den == -1:
                print(f"a = {a}: c = {-simplified_num}")
            else:
                print(f"a = {a}: c = {simplified_num}/{simplified_den}")

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

enumerate_conditions()
```
