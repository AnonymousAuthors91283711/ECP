. Enumerated Answers: Mike's distance = 13.00000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to provide a noncomputable real number answer. The problem involves calculating Mike's distance traveled, which from the enumerated answers is exactly 13. The error occurs because we're trying to define a real number computation that Lean can't automatically verify as computable.

The key observations:
1. The problem involves speeds and distances
2. From the theorem statement, Mike's speed * t equals the answer
3. The enumerated answer shows Mike's distance is exactly 13
4. The error suggests we need to mark this as noncomputable

The correct answer should be 13, but we need to properly handle the real number definition in Lean. Here's the corrected version:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2005AMCA_6_answer : ℝ := 13>>> 

Explanation:
- The problem's enumerated answer shows Mike's distance is exactly 13
- The theorem's condition `mike_speed * t = P2005AMCA_6_answer` suggests this is the value we need
- We mark it as noncomputable since it involves real number division which Lean can't automatically verify as computable
- The value 13 matches both the enumerated answer and the problem's conditions when substituted back[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

. Enumerated Answers: Mike's distance = 13.00000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the problem statement and the enumerated answer, we can see that Mike's distance (P2005AMCA_6_answer) is simply 13. The error in the proposed answer comes from incorrectly repeating the declaration and using the 'noncomputable' keyword unnecessarily.

The problem involves two people (Josh and Mike) traveling distances related to 13, and the enumerated answer confirms that Mike's distance is exactly 13. The speed calculations in the theorem show that this is indeed the correct solution.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<13>>>
