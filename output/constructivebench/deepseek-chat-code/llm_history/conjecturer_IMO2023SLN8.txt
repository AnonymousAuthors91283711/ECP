abbrev IMO2023SLN8_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem IMO2023SLN8 (f : ℕ → ℕ) (hf : ∀ n, 0 < n → 0 < f n) :
  (∀ a b, 0 < a → 0 < b → (f^[f a] (a + 1)) = (a + 1) * f b) ↔ f = IMO2023SLN8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing functions f(n) = n^k for n=1..5, k=1..3

Testing f(n) = n^1:
Fails at (a,b)=(1,2): 2 ≠ 4

Testing f(n) = n^2:
Fails at (a,b)=(1,1): 4 ≠ 2

Testing f(n) = n^3:
Fails at (a,b)=(1,1): 8 ≠ 2

Testing complete. The pattern suggests f(n) = n is a solution.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun n : ℕ => n>>>
