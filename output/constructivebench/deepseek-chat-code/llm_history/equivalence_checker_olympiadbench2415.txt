Ground Truth Answer: fun x => (x - 1) * (x - 2) / 6
Proposed Answer: fun m : ℝ => (m^2 - 3*m) / 6
Let's analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

The ground truth answer is: fun x => (x - 1) * (x - 2) / 6
The proposed answer is: fun m : ℝ => (m^2 - 3*m) / 6

Let's expand the ground truth answer:
(x - 1)(x - 2)/6 = (x² - 3x + 2)/6 = (x²)/6 - (3x)/6 + 2/6 = (x² - 3x)/6 + 1/3

The proposed answer is:
(m² - 3m)/6 = (m²)/6 - (3m)/6 = (m² - 3m)/6

The difference between them is the constant term +1/3 in the ground truth answer. Therefore, the proposed answer is not equivalent to the ground truth answer.
