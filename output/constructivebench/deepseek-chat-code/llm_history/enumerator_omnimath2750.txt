This problem involves finding the value of an expression under a linear constraint. The expression can be simplified algebraically before needing to enumerate any values. Here's a Python program that demonstrates the simplification and verifies the constant result:

```python
# Problem: Given x + 2y = 30, find value of (x/5 + 2y/3 + 2y/5 + x/3)
# Algebraic simplification:
# Combine terms: (x/5 + x/3) + (2y/3 + 2y/5) = x(8/15) + 2y(16/15)
# Factor out 8/15: (8/15)(x + 4y)
# From x + 2y = 30, we get x = 30 - 2y
# Substitute: (8/15)(30 - 2y + 4y) = (8/15)(30 + 2y)
# This still depends on y, suggesting the original simplification needs adjustment

# Let's try a different approach - combine all terms with common denominators:
# Original expression: x/5 + 2y/3 + 2y/5 + x/3
# = (3x + 5x)/15 + (10y + 6y)/15
# = (8x + 16y)/15
# = 8(x + 2y)/15
# From constraint x + 2y = 30, so expression = 8*30/15 = 16

# Verification code:
def verify():
    # Test with specific y values to confirm the constant result
    test_cases = [1, 5, 10, 15]  # sample y values
    for y in test_cases:
        x = 30 - 2 * y
        result = (x/5 + 2*y/3 + 2*y/5 + x/3)
        print(f"For y={y}, x={x}, expression value = {result}")

verify()
```

The program demonstrates that regardless of the y value chosen (with x determined by the constraint), the expression always evaluates to 16. The algebraic simplification shows this must hold true for all valid (x,y) pairs satisfying x + 2y = 30.
