theorem P2016AMCA_5 (n : ℕ) : 
  Even n ∧ n > 2 ∧ ¬∃ (p q : ℕ), p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ p + q = n ↔ n ∈ P2016AMCA_5_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | Even n ∧ n > 2 ∧ ∀ (p q : ℕ), p.Prime → q.Prime → p + q ≠ n}
Proposed Answer: {n | Even n ∧ n > 2 ∧ ∀ p ≤ n/2, ¬(Nat.Prime p ∧ Nat.Prime (n - p))}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but differs slightly in formulation. The ground truth answer checks all prime pairs (p,q) for p+q≠n, while the proposed answer only checks primes p up to n/2 (which is sufficient due to symmetry but not identical in expression). The logical meaning is equivalent, but the formulations differ.
