abbrev omnimath3035_answer : ℤ × ℤ → ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3035 (x y : ℤ) (z : ℚ) : 
  2 * x - 3 * z = 5 * y ↔ z = omnimath3035_answer (x, y) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing possible forms for z = (a*x + b*y)/3:
Found valid form: z = (2x + -5y)/3

The solution appears to be:
z = (2x - 5y)/3. Expected Answer Type: ℤ × ℤ → ℚ
<<<fun (x, y) => (2 * x - 5 * y) / 3>>>
