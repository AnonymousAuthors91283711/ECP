[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number n â‰¥ 6 such that the binomial coefficient C(n,6) equals 6 times C(n,3). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of n and check this condition.

The key observation is that C(n,k) = n!/(k!(n-k)!), so we can write the equation as:
n!/(6!(n-6)!) = 6 * n!/(3!(n-3)!)
Simplifying this gives us an equation we can check for each n.

```python
import math

def find_min_n():
    for n in range(6, 100):  # Reasonable upper bound
        lhs = math.comb(n, 6)
        rhs = 6 * math.comb(n, 3)
        print(f"Testing n={n}: C({n},6)={lhs}, 6*C({n},3)={rhs}")
        if lhs == rhs:
            print(f"Found solution: n={n}")
            return n
    print("No solution found in range")
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_n()
```
