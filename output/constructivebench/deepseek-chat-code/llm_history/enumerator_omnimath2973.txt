[write_program]
The problem asks for the count of numbers from 0 to 99 (inclusive) that contain the digit '6' in their decimal representation. We'll write a Python program to enumerate these numbers and count them.

```python
count = 0
for n in range(100):
    if '6' in str(n):
        print(n)  # Print each number containing '6'
        count += 1
print(f"Total count: {count}")  # Final count
```
