numerals are polymorphic in Lean, but the numeral `0` cannot be used in a context where the expected type is
  Prop
due to the absence of the instance above

. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
The error occurs because Lean interprets `0` as a Prop when it's used in a set comprehension. We need to properly construct the set using `Set` operations. Based on the enumerated answers, we see three valid solutions: the zero function, the linear function x-1, and the quadratic function x²-1.

Here's the corrected answer using proper set operations:

<<<{fun _ : ℝ => 0, fun x : ℝ => x - 1, fun x : ℝ => x^2 - 1}>>>

Explanation:
1. The error was caused by using logical OR (`∨`) in a set comprehension where Lean expected Prop operations. Instead, we should explicitly list the functions as elements of the set.
2. The enumerated answers show that only these three functions satisfy both the functional equation and the condition f(-1) ≠ 0 (except the zero function which is included as a special case).
3. The zero function is included because it trivially satisfies the equation (though it doesn't satisfy f(-1) ≠ 0, but the problem statement allows for solutions where either condition holds).
4. The other two functions are the non-trivial solutions that satisfy both conditions.
