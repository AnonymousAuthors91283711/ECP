This problem asks for the number of subsets of size ≥3 from a 10-element circular set (Fin 10) that contain at least one consecutive triple (considering the circular nature). We'll enumerate all possible subsets of size ≥3 and count those containing a consecutive triple.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def has_consecutive_triple(subset):
    n = len(subset)
    for i in range(n):
        # Check if three consecutive elements (mod 10) exist
        a, b, c = subset[i], subset[(i+1)%n], subset[(i+2)%n]
        if (b - a) % 10 == 1 and (c - b) % 10 == 1:
            return True
    return False

def count_valid_subsets():
    total = 0
    elements = list(range(10))  # Fin 10 elements
    for size in range(3, 11):   # Subsets of size 3 to 10
        for subset in combinations(elements, size):
            if has_consecutive_triple(subset):
                total += 1
                print(subset)  # Print each valid subset found
    return total

print("Counting valid subsets...")
result = count_valid_subsets()
print(f"Total valid subsets: {result}")
```

The program enumerates all subsets of size 3 to 10 of a 10-element set, checks each for containing at least one consecutive triple (considering the circular nature), and counts them. The output shows each valid subset found and the final count. The circular nature is handled by using modulo 10 arithmetic when checking for consecutive elements.
