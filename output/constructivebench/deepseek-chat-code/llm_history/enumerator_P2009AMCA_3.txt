[write_program]
This problem involves evaluating a simple arithmetic expression. The expression is (1/4 + (1/3)*((3/4) - (1/4))). We'll compute this exactly using Python's fractions module to avoid floating-point approximations.

The program will:
1. Use fractions.Fraction for exact arithmetic
2. Compute each part of the expression step by step
3. Print the final simplified result

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_expression():
    # Compute each part of the expression
    term1 = Fraction(1, 4)
    inner_diff = Fraction(3, 4) - Fraction(1, 4)
    term2 = Fraction(1, 3) * inner_diff
    result = term1 + term2
    
    # Print the exact fraction and decimal approximation
    print(f"Exact value: {result}")
    print(f"Decimal approximation: {float(result)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_expression()
```
