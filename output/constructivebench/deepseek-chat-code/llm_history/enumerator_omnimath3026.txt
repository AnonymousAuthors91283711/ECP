The problem asks to find the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a given list of real numbers. The solution involves computing these extrema and their difference. Here's a Python program that calculates this:

```python
def main():
    numbers = [0.023, 0.302, 0.203, 0.320, 0.032]
    max_val = max(numbers)
    min_val = min(numbers)
    difference = max_val - min_val
    print(f"Maximum: {max_val}")
    print(f"Minimum: {min_val}")
    print(f"Difference: {difference}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
