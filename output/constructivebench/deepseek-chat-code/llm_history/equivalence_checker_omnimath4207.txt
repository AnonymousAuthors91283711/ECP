Ground Truth Answer: fun n => {s | ∃ k : ℕ, k < n ∧ s = 2^k}
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => Icc 1 n
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a set of natural numbers with:
   - Exactly n elements (n=100)
   - All elements between 1 and M (M=25000)
   - Unique sums property (x+y=x'+y' implies x=x' and y=y')

2. Ground Truth Answer: {2^k | k < n}
   - This gives exactly n distinct powers of 2
   - 2^100 is much larger than 25000, but 2^14=16384 and 2^15=32768, so only first 14 powers fit
   - However, the unique sums property holds for powers of 2 (since binary representations are unique)

3. Proposed Answer: Icc 1 n (numbers from 1 to n)
   - This gives exactly n elements (1 to 100)
   - All elements are between 1 and 25000
   - But fails the unique sums property (e.g. 1+4=2+3=5)

The proposed answer satisfies the cardinality and range conditions but fails the unique sums property, while the ground truth answer would satisfy all properties if we adjust the range constraint.
