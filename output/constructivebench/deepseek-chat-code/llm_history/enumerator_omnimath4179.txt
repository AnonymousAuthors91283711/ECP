[write_program]
This problem involves finding all natural numbers n for which there exists a sequence of n moves (flips) on a 4Ã—4 grid of lights (initially all off) that turns all lights on. Each flip toggles a light and its orthogonally adjacent neighbors. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible n values where such a sequence exists.

The approach:
1. Represent the grid as a 16-bit integer (each bit represents a light)
2. Model each flip as a bitmask operation (toggling center + adjacent bits)
3. Use BFS to find minimal sequences that reach the all-on state
4. Track which n values can reach the solution

```python
from collections import deque

def main():
    size = 4
    total = size * size
    target = (1 << total) - 1  # All lights on
    
    # Precompute flip masks for each position
    masks = []
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            mask = 0
            for di, dj in [(0,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0)]:
                ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                if 0 <= ni < size and 0 <= nj < size:
                    pos = ni * size + nj
                    mask ^= (1 << pos)
            masks.append(mask)
    
    # BFS to find minimal steps
    visited = {0: 0}  # state: steps
    queue = deque([0])
    possible_n = set()
    
    while queue:
        state = queue.popleft()
        steps = visited[state]
        
        if state == target:
            possible_n.add(steps)
            continue
        
        for mask in masks:
            new_state = state ^ mask
            if new_state not in visited:
                visited[new_state] = steps + 1
                queue.append(new_state)
    
    # Output possible n values in order
    print("Possible n values:", sorted(possible_n))
    print("Minimal solution:", min(possible_n))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
