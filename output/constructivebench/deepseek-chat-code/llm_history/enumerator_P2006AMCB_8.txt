[write_program]
This problem involves solving for real numbers a and b given two equations, then computing their sum. The equations are:
1. 1 = (1/4)*(2 + a)
2. 2 = (1/4)*(1 + b)

We'll solve these equations algebraically and compute a + b. The Python program will verify the solution by solving the equations numerically.

```python
def solve_equations():
    # Solve first equation: 1 = (1/4)*(2 + a)
    a = 4 * 1 - 2
    # Solve second equation: 2 = (1/4)*(1 + b)
    b = 4 * 2 - 1
    # Compute and print the sum
    sum_ab = a + b
    print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}, a + b = {sum_ab}")
