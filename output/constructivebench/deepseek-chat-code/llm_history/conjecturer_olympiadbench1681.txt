abbrev olympiadbench1681_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench1681 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
    Surjective f ∧ (∀ m n p, Prime p → (p ∣ f (m + n) ↔ p ∣ f m + f n)) ↔ f = olympiadbench1681_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found candidate: f(n) = 1n
The solution is likely f(n) = n. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun n : ℕ => n>>>
