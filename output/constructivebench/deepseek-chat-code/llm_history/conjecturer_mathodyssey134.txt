Maximum family size for universe_size=4: 4

For n=10, theoretical maximum is likely C(9,4)=126
Full enumeration impractical, but this is the conjectured answer.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<Nat.choose 9 4>>> 

Explanation: The problem describes finding the largest family of subsets of Fin 10 where any two subsets intersect (pairwise intersecting family). The enumerated pattern suggests for n=4 elements, the maximum family size is 4, which equals C(3,1). Extending this pattern to n=10 suggests C(9,4)=126 as the maximum size, following Erdős-Ko-Rado theorem for intersecting families.
