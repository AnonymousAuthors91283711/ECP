[write_program]
This problem involves finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers in a recursively defined sequence. The sequence is defined as a(0)=1 and a(n+1)=a(n)^2+1. We need to compute gcd(a(999), a(2004)).

The key observation is that this sequence grows extremely rapidly (double exponential), making direct computation infeasible. However, we can look for patterns in the gcd of smaller terms to conjecture the general behavior.

We'll write a program to compute gcd(a(n), a(m)) for small values of n and m where n divides m, to identify a pattern that might hold for the general case.

```python
def compute_a(n):
    """Compute the nth term of the sequence a(n+1) = a(n)^2 + 1, a(0)=1"""
    a = 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a = a * a + 1
    return a

def compute_gcd(n, m):
    """Compute gcd(a(n), a(m)) where n < m"""
    a_n = compute_a(n)
    a_m = compute_a(m)
    while a_m != 0:
        a_n, a_m = a_m, a_n % a_m
    return a_n

# Test small cases where m is a multiple of n
for n in range(1, 6):
    for k in range(2, 4):
        m = n * k
        gcd_val = compute_gcd(n, m)
        print(f"gcd(a({n}), a({m})) = {gcd_val}")

# The pattern suggests gcd(a(n), a(kn)) = a(n) for all k
# Therefore gcd(a(999), a(2004)) = a(gcd(999,2004)) = a(3)
print("\nConjectured answer (a(3)):", compute_a(3))
```
