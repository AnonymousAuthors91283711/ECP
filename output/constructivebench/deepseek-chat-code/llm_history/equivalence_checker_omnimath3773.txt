Ground Truth Answer: {f : ℤ → ℤ | ∃ c : ℤ, ∀ x : ℤ, f x = x ^ 2 + c * x}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ k : ℤ, ∀ n : ℤ, f n = n^2 + k * n}
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The two answers are equivalent. The ground truth answer uses the variable name 'c' while the proposed answer uses 'k', but they both represent the same existential quantifier over integers. The structure of the solutions is identical: both describe functions of the form f(x) = x² + kx (or x² + cx) for some constant integer k (or c). The variable naming difference doesn't affect the mathematical equivalence.
