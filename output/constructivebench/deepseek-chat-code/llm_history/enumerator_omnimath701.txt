This problem involves calculating a probability where Jerry and Neil each choose numbers from {1,2,3} with specific probability distributions. We'll enumerate all possible combinations of Jerry's choice (j) and Neil's choice (n), compute the joint probabilities, and sum the cases where n=3.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    outcomes = {1, 2, 3}
    total = Fraction(0, 1)
    
    for j in outcomes:
        # Jerry's probability of choosing j
        jerry_p = Fraction(1, 3)
        
        for n in outcomes:
            if n == 3:
                # Neil's probability of choosing n given j
                if n >= j and n in outcomes:
                    neil_p = Fraction(1, 3) * (Fraction(2, 3)) ** (n - j)
                else:
                    neil_p = Fraction(0, 1)
                
                joint_p = jerry_p * neil_p
                total += joint_p
                print(f"j={j}, n={n}: probability {joint_p}")
    
    print(f"Total probability: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
