[write_program]
This problem asks to find all integer pairs (x,y) that satisfy the equation x² + xy + y² = ((x+y)/3 + 1)³. We'll write a Python program to search for such pairs efficiently.

The approach:
1. We'll search within a reasonable bound (-100 to 100) for demonstration
2. For each x in this range, we'll compute possible y values that could satisfy the equation
3. We'll check if both sides evaluate to the same integer value
4. We'll print valid pairs as we find them

```python
def find_pairs():
    bound = 100
    found_pairs = []
    
    for x in range(-bound, bound + 1):
        # Calculate the discriminant for possible y values
        for y in range(-bound, bound + 1):
            left = x**2 + x*y + y**2
            denominator = 3
            numerator = x + y + 3
            if numerator % denominator != 0:
                continue
            right = (numerator // denominator)**3
            
            if left == right:
                found_pairs.append((x, y))
                print(f"Found pair: ({x}, {y})")
    
    print("\nAll found pairs:")
    for pair in found_pairs:
        print(pair)

find_pairs()
```
