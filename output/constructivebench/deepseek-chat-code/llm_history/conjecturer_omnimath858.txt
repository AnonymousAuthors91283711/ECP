abbrev omnimath858_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath858
: {p : Equiv.Perm (Fin 10) | (∀ i : Fin 10, p i ≠ i) ∧ (∀ i : Fin 10, p (p i) = i)}.ncard = omnimath858_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Number of deranged involutions for n=10: 945

Showing pattern for smaller even n values:
n=2: 1
n=4: 3
n=6: 15
n=8: 105
n=10: 945. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<(10 - 1) * (10 - 3) * (10 - 5) * (10 - 7) * (10 - 9)>>>
