[write_program]
This problem asks to find all triples (x, y, z) of natural numbers satisfying the equation 2^x + 9*7^y = z^3. We'll write a Python program to search for solutions by enumerating possible values of x and y, then checking if the resulting z is an integer.

The approach:
1. Iterate x from 0 to a reasonable upper bound (we'll use 20 since 2^20 is already over a million)
2. For each x, iterate y from 0 to a reasonable upper bound (we'll use 10 since 7^10 is very large)
3. Compute z_cubed = 2^x + 9*7^y
4. Check if z_cubed is a perfect cube by computing its cube root and verifying
5. Print any valid triples found

```python
import math

def find_solutions():
    max_x = 20
    max_y = 10
    solutions = []
    
    for x in range(0, max_x + 1):
        for y in range(0, max_y + 1):
            z_cubed = (2 ** x) + 9 * (7 ** y)
            if z_cubed < 0:
                continue
            z = round(z_cubed ** (1/3))
            # Check if z^3 equals exactly z_cubed
            if z ** 3 == z_cubed:
                print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")
                solutions.append((x, y, z))
    
    print("\nAll solutions found:")
    for sol in solutions:
        print(sol)

find_solutions()
```
