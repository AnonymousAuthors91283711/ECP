This problem involves finding all integer pairs (x, y) that satisfy the equation:
7x + 14y = 5x² + 5xy + 5y²

We can simplify and rearrange the equation to:
5x² + 5xy + 5y² - 7x - 14y = 0

The approach is to:
1. Iterate over possible integer values of x and y within a reasonable range
2. Check if they satisfy the equation
3. Print valid pairs as they are found

Since the equation is quadratic, we'll limit our search to a range where the terms might balance out (say -100 to 100).

```python
def find_solutions():
    print("Searching for integer solutions (x, y) to 7x + 14y = 5x² + 5xy + 5y²")
    found = False
    for x in range(-100, 101):
        for y in range(-100, 101):
            left = 7 * x + 14 * y
            right = 5 * x**2 + 5 * x * y + 5 * y**2
            if left == right:
                print(f"Found solution: ({x}, {y})")
                found = True
    if not found:
        print("No solutions found in range -100 to 100")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solutions()
```
