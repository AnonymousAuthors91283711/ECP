This problem asks for the minimum value of (a*b + c)/(a + b + c) where a, b, c are natural numbers between 1 and 2011. To find this, we'll enumerate small values first since the minimum likely occurs at small parameters.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible small values of a, b, c (up to 10 is sufficient to find the minimum)
2. Calculate the expression for each combination
3. Track the minimum value found
4. Output all candidate values and finally the minimum

```python
def main():
    min_value = float('inf')
    # We limit to a,b,c <= 10 since minimum likely occurs in this range
    for a in range(1, 11):
        for b in range(1, 11):
            for c in range(1, 11):
                numerator = a * b + c
                denominator = a + b + c
                value = numerator / denominator
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}: {value}")
                if value < min_value:
                    min_value = value
    print(f"\nMinimum value found: {min_value}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
