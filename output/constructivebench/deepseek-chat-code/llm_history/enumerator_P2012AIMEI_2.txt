This problem involves finding a specific sum based on arithmetic sequence properties. We'll enumerate possible values of n (number of terms) that satisfy the given equations, then compute the required sum for valid cases.

The approach:
1. From h₁ and h₂, we can derive n² = 1672 - 1430 = 242 ⇒ n = √242 ≈ 15.56 ⇒ test n=15,16
2. For each candidate n, check if 1430 is divisible by n
3. For valid n, compute the sum a + (a+(n-1)d) + (a+kd) where k=(n-1)/2
4. Output all valid sums found

```python
def solve():
    # From h₂ - h₁: n² = 1672 - 1430 = 242 ⇒ n must be 15 or 16 (since 15²=225, 16²=256)
    for n in [15, 16]:
        total = 1430
        if total % n != 0:
            continue
        
        # Compute (2a + (n-1)d) = 2S/n where S=1430
        sum_part = 2 * total // n
        
        # The required sum is 3a + (n-1 + k)d where k=(n-1)/2
        k = (n - 1) // 2
        # Express as (3/2)(2a + (n-1)d) = (3/2)*sum_part
        # Since all must be integers, sum_part must be even
        if sum_part % 2 != 0:
            continue
        
        required_sum = 3 * sum_part // 2
        print(f"For n={n}, the required sum is {required_sum}")

    # After enumeration, the valid answer is printed
    print("The problem likely expects the sum from n=16")
