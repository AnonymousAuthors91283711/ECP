[write_program]
This problem involves solving a logarithmic equation with variable x. We'll write a Python program to find real positive solutions (x > 0, x ≠ 1) that satisfy the equation. The approach will be to:

1. Transform the equation into a quadratic form in terms of log(x)
2. Solve for possible values of log(x)
3. Convert back to x values
4. Verify which solutions satisfy the original conditions

We'll use small numerical values to test the solutions and print valid ones.

```python
import math

def solve_equation():
    print("Possible solutions for x > 0, x ≠ 1:")
    
    # Transform equation: let y = log(x)/log(4)
    # Equation becomes: y - 2/y = 7/6 - 1.5/y
    # Multiply through by y: y² - 2 = (7/6)y - 1.5
    # Rearrange: 6y² - 7y - 3 = 0
    
    # Solve quadratic equation 6y² - 7y - 3 = 0
    discriminant = 7**2 - 4*6*(-3)
    y1 = (7 + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*6)
    y2 = (7 - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*6)
    
    # Convert back to x: x = 4^y
    x1 = 4 ** y1
    x2 = 4 ** y2
    
    # Verify conditions and solutions
    for x in [x1, x2]:
        if x > 0 and not math.isclose(x, 1, abs_tol=1e-10):
            # Verify original equation
            lhs = math.log(x)/math.log(4) - math.log(16)/math.log(x)
            rhs = 7/6 - math.log(8)/math.log(x)
            if math.isclose(lhs, rhs, rel_tol=1e-9):
                print(f"x = {x}")
