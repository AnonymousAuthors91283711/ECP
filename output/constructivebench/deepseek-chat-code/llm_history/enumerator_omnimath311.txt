This problem asks for the largest set of 6-digit numbers (each digit 0-9) such that any two distinct numbers differ in at least 2 positions. We'll enumerate possible set sizes for smaller cases first to identify a pattern.

```python
from itertools import product, combinations

def count_differences(p1, p2):
    return sum(1 for a, b in zip(p1, p2) if a != b)

def max_set_size(length, digits):
    max_size = 0
    # Try all possible set sizes in descending order
    for size in range(10**length, 0, -1):
        # Generate all possible combinations of 'size' numbers
        for candidate in combinations(product(range(digits), repeat=length), size):
            valid = True
            # Check all pairs in the candidate set
            for p1, p2 in combinations(candidate, 2):
                if count_differences(p1, p2) < 2:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                print(f"Found valid set of size {size}")
                return size
    return 0

# Test smaller cases first to identify pattern
for length in range(1, 5):
    print(f"\nTesting length={length}")
    max_size = max_set_size(length, 10)
    print(f"Maximum set size for length {length}: {max_size}")

# For length=6, we'll use the identified pattern (10^(n-1)) without full enumeration
print("\nFor length=6, conjectured maximum set size:", 10**5)
```
