The problem is to solve for x in the equation a*(x+2) + b*(x+2) = 60 given that a + b = 12. We can simplify this algebraically:

1. Factor out (x+2): (a + b)(x + 2) = 60
2. Substitute a + b = 12: 12(x + 2) = 60
3. Divide both sides by 12: x + 2 = 5
4. Subtract 2: x = 3

The Python program should verify this by testing with various (a,b) pairs that satisfy a + b = 12, showing that x=3 is always the solution.

```python
def test_solution(a, b):
    # Given a + b = 12, check if x=3 satisfies the equation
    x = 3
    lhs = a * (x + 2) + b * (x + 2)
    rhs = 60
    return abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-9  # Account for floating point precision

# Test with various (a,b) pairs where a + b = 12
test_cases = [
    (6, 6),
    (0, 12),
    (12, 0),
    (3.5, 8.5),
    (-1, 13),
    (7.2, 4.8)
]

for a, b in test_cases:
    print(f"Testing a={a}, b={b}:", "Valid" if test_solution(a, b) else "Invalid")

print("Consistent solution found: x = 3")
```
