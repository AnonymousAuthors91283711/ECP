[write_program]
This problem asks to find the natural number `n` such that `4^n = 64^2`. We'll write a Python program to solve this equation by computing both sides and comparing them for different values of `n`.

The approach is:
1. Compute the right-hand side (64^2) once
2. Iterate through possible values of `n` starting from 0
3. For each `n`, compute 4^n and compare with the precomputed 64^2
4. Stop when we find the matching `n`

```python
def main():
    rhs = 64 ** 2  # Compute 64^2 = 4096
    n = 0
    while True:
        lhs = 4 ** n
        print(f"Testing n={n}: 4^{n} = {lhs}")
        if lhs == rhs:
            print(f"Found solution: n = {n}")
            break
        elif lhs > rhs:
            print("No solution found (overshot)")
            break
        n += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
