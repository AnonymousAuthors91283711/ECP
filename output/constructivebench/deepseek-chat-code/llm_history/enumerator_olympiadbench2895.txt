[write_program]
This problem involves finding real numbers a and b that satisfy two cubic equations, and then determining the value of a + b. We'll approach this by:

1. Finding the roots of the first equation for a
2. For each real root a, solving the second equation for b
3. Checking if any pair (a,b) satisfies both equations
4. Calculating a + b for valid pairs

The program will numerically approximate the roots since exact solutions to general cubics are complex.

```python
import numpy as np

# Coefficients for the cubic equations
# a^3 -15a^2 +20a -50 = 0
coeff_a = [1, -15, 20, -50]
# 8b^3 -60b^2 -290b +2575 = 0
coeff_b = [8, -60, -290, 2575]

# Find real roots for a
roots_a = np.roots(coeff_a)
real_roots_a = [r.real for r in roots_a if abs(r.imag) < 1e-10]

print("Possible a values:", real_roots_a)

# For each real a, find corresponding b and check a + b
for a in real_roots_a:
    # Substitute a into second equation to get new coefficients for b
    # Original equation: 8b^3 -60b^2 -290b +2575 = 0
    # We keep this as is since there's no a in the b equation
    
    # Find real roots for b
    roots_b = np.roots(coeff_b)
    real_roots_b = [r.real for r in roots_b if abs(r.imag) < 1e-10]
    
    print(f"For a={a:.5f}, possible b values:", [f"{b:.5f}" for b in real_roots_b])
    
    # Calculate a + b for all combinations
    for b in real_roots_b:
        sum_ab = a + b
        print(f"a + b = {sum_ab:.5f} for a={a:.5f}, b={b:.5f}")

# The output shows one consistent sum value that appears for all valid pairs
```
