[write_program]
This problem involves finding the maximum size of a set C of coordinate pairs (i,j) such that there exists exactly one subset T of size n where all pairs in T are non-attacking (no shared row or column). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values for small n.

The approach:
1. For small n (1-4), we'll generate all possible grid sizes and configurations
2. For each grid size, we'll count valid configurations
3. We'll track the maximum C size where exactly one T exists

```python
from itertools import combinations, product

def is_non_attacking(pairs):
    """Check if all pairs in the set are non-attacking (no shared row/column)"""
    rows = set()
    cols = set()
    for i, j in pairs:
        if i in rows or j in cols:
            return False
        rows.add(i)
        cols.add(j)
    return True

def count_valid_subsets(C, n):
    """Count how many size-n non-attacking subsets exist in C"""
    count = 0
    for subset in combinations(C, n):
        if is_non_attacking(subset):
            count += 1
            if count > 1:  # Early exit if multiple found
                return count
    return count

def find_max_C(n, max_grid=6):
    """Find maximum C size with exactly one non-attacking n-subset for grid up to max_grid"""
    max_k = 0
    for grid_size in range(1, max_grid + 1):
        coords = list(product(range(grid_size), repeat=2))
        for k in range(n, len(coords) + 1):
            for C in combinations(coords, k):
                if count_valid_subsets(C, n) == 1:
                    if k > max_k:
                        max_k = k
                        print(f"n={n}: new max k={k} (grid {grid_size}x{grid_size})")
                    break  # Found one, no need to check other C's of same size
    return max_k

for n in range(1, 5):
    print(f"\nSearching for n={n}:")
    result = find_max_C(n)
    print(f"Final maximum for n={n}: {result}")
```
