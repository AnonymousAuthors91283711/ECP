This problem involves finding the coefficient B of a 6th-degree polynomial with positive integer roots. We'll enumerate possible roots and compute the corresponding polynomial coefficients.

The approach:
1. Find all combinations of 6 positive integers (roots)
2. For each combination, expand (x-r1)(x-r2)...(x-r6) to get coefficients
3. Match the known coefficients (x^6 term is 1, x^5 term is -10, constant term is 16)
4. Output valid B coefficients found

```python
import itertools
from math import prod
from collections import defaultdict

def main():
    # We know sum of roots is 10 (from x^5 coefficient)
    # Product of roots is 16 (from constant term)
    # Find all 6-tuples of positive integers with sum 10 and product 16
    max_root = 8  # since 2^4*1^2=16 and sum would be <= 4*2+2*1=10
    
    # Generate all possible combinations with sum 10 and product 16
    valid_roots = []
    for roots in itertools.combinations_with_replacement(range(1, max_root+1), 6):
        if sum(roots) == 10 and prod(roots) == 16:
            # Need to consider all permutations of the roots
            # Use a set to avoid duplicate orderings
            valid_roots.append(roots)
    
    # For each unique root combination, compute polynomial coefficients
    B_values = set()
    for roots in valid_roots:
        # Compute elementary symmetric polynomials
        # We only need the x^3 coefficient (B)
        # Using Vieta's formulas:
        sum_pair_triple = 0
        n = len(roots)
        for triple in itertools.combinations(roots, 3):
            sum_pair_triple += prod(triple)
        B = sum_pair_triple
        
        print(f"Roots: {roots}, B: {B}")
        B_values.add(B)
    
    if len(B_values) == 1:
        print(f"\nUnique B value found: {B_values.pop()}")
    else:
        print(f"\nMultiple B values found: {B_values}")
