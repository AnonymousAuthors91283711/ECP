[write_program]
This problem involves summing the reciprocals of all positive integers whose prime factors are only 2 and 2017. We'll write a Python program to enumerate these numbers and compute partial sums of their reciprocals to observe convergence.

The approach:
1. Generate numbers of the form 2^a * 2017^b where a,b are non-negative integers
2. Compute their reciprocals and accumulate the sum
3. Print partial sums to observe convergence

```python
def enumerate_reciprocal_sums():
    max_a = 20  # Upper bound for exponent of 2
    max_b = 5    # Upper bound for exponent of 2017
    total = 0.0
    
    for a in range(max_a + 1):
        for b in range(max_b + 1):
            n = (2 ** a) * (2017 ** b)
            if n == 0:
                continue
            reciprocal = 1.0 / n
            total += reciprocal
            print(f"2^{a} * 2017^{b} = {n}, reciprocal: {reciprocal:.15f}, current sum: {total:.15f}")

    print(f"\nFinal sum after enumeration: {total:.15f}")

enumerate_reciprocal_sums()
```

The program generates numbers of the form 2^a * 2017^b with a up to 20 and b up to 5 (since 2017^5 is already a very large number). For each number, it computes its reciprocal and adds it to a running total, printing intermediate results. The final sum gives an approximation of the infinite series sum.

Note that the exact mathematical answer would involve recognizing this as the product of two geometric series (for the primes 2 and 2017), but the program helps build intuition by showing how the partial sums behave.
