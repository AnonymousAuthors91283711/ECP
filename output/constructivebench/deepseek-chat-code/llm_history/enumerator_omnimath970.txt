[write_program]
The problem asks to find all 6-digit numbers starting and ending with digit '2' (at positions 0 and 5 in the digit list) that can be expressed as the product of three consecutive even numbers (2k, 2(k+1), 2(k+2)). We'll write a Python program to enumerate such numbers.

Key observations:
1. The number must be between 200,000 and 299,999
2. It must be divisible by 8 (from the three even numbers)
3. The last digit must be 2 (from problem statement)

We'll iterate through possible k values that could produce 6-digit numbers in this range.

```python
def is_six_digit_start_end_with_2(n):
    digits = list(map(int, str(n)))
    return len(digits) == 6 and digits[0] == 2 and digits[-1] == 2

def find_numbers():
    results = []
    # Estimate k range: 2k*2(k+1)*2(k+2) = 8k(k+1)(k+2) ≈ 200,000 to 300,000
    # k^3 ≈ 200000/8 → k ≈ 30
    for k in range(20, 40):  # Wider range to be safe
        n = 8 * k * (k + 1) * (k + 2)
        if 200000 <= n <= 299999 and is_six_digit_start_end_with_2(n):
            print(n)
            results.append(n)
    if results:
        print("All found numbers:", sorted(results))
    else:
        print("No numbers found")

find_numbers()
```
