This problem involves finding the sum A + H given a series of equations with consecutive triple sums equal to 30 and C fixed at 5. We'll enumerate possible values by solving the equations step by step.

```python
def solve():
    C = 5  # Given
    # We'll iterate possible A values since others can be derived
    for A in range(0, 31):  # A can be at most 30 since A+B+C=30 and B,Câ‰¥0
        B = 30 - A - C
        if B < 0:
            continue
        D = 30 - B - C
        E = 30 - C - D
        F = 30 - D - E
        G = 30 - E - F
        H = 30 - F - G
        
        # Verify all variables are non-negative
        if all(x >= 0 for x in [B, D, E, F, G, H]):
            print(f"A={A}, H={H}, A+H={A+H}")

    # After enumeration, we observe the constant sum
    print("Final observed constant sum:", A+H)  # Will print the constant value found

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```
