This problem involves iterating a function that takes the arithmetic and harmonic means of two positive real numbers. We need to find what value the sequence converges to after 2017 iterations starting from (1, 10^8). The solution should observe the convergence pattern.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Simulate the iteration process
2. Track how quickly the values converge
3. Observe the limiting value

The key insight is that repeatedly applying arithmetic and harmonic means converges to the geometric mean. We'll verify this numerically.

```python
def iterate_f(start, iterations):
    a, b = start
    for i in range(iterations):
        # Print every 100 iterations to observe convergence
        if i % 100 == 0:
            print(f"Iteration {i}: a={a}, b={b}")
        new_a = (a + b) / 2
        new_b = 2 / (1/a + 1/b)
        a, b = new_a, new_b
    return a, b

# Starting values
initial_a = 1.0
initial_b = 10**8
iterations = 2017

# Calculate geometric mean for comparison
geometric_mean = (initial_a * initial_b) ** 0.5

print(f"Starting values: a={initial_a}, b={initial_b}")
print(f"Geometric mean: {geometric_mean}")

final_a, final_b = iterate_f((initial_a, initial_b), iterations)
print(f"Final values after {iterations} iterations:")
print(f"a={final_a}, b={final_b}")
print(f"Difference from geometric mean: {abs(min(final_a, final_b) - geometric_mean)}")
```
