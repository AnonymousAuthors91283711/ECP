[write_program]
This problem asks to find all real numbers x that satisfy the equation:
x = √(x - 1/x) + √(1 - 1/x)

We'll write a Python program to numerically search for solutions by:
1. Defining the domain where both square roots are real (x ≥ 1)
2. Evaluating the equation at different x values
3. Checking when both sides are approximately equal

```python
import math

def equation(x):
    if x <= 0 or x*(x-1) < 0 or (x-1/x) < 0 or (1-1/x) < 0:
        return float('nan')  # outside domain
    return math.sqrt(x - 1/x) + math.sqrt(1 - 1/x)

# Search in [1, 2] with small steps since we expect solution near golden ratio
step = 0.00001
x = 1.0
while x <= 2.0:
    rhs = equation(x)
    if not math.isnan(rhs) and abs(x - rhs) < 1e-8:
        print(f"Solution found: x ≈ {x:.10f}")
    x += step

# After scanning, print the most precise solution found
phi = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2
print(f"Note: The golden ratio is φ ≈ {phi:.10f}")
```
