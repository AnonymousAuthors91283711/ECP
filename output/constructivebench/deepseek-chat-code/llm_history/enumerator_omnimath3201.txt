This problem involves calculating a simple arithmetic expression. The solution is straightforward and doesn't require enumeration. We'll compute the exact value of the expression (50*76 - 40*80)/(50 - 40) directly.

```python
# Calculate (50*76 - 40*80)/(50 - 40)
numerator = 50 * 76 - 40 * 80
denominator = 50 - 40
result = numerator / denominator
print(result)
```
