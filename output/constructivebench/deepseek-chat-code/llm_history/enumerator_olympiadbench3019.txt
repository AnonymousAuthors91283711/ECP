[write_program]
This problem asks for the greatest integer `c` such that there exist integers `a, b, d` satisfying:
1. a + b*c = 20
2. -a + c*d = 19

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of `c` and check if suitable integers `a, b, d` exist. We'll search `c` in descending order since we want the greatest solution.

```python
def solve():
    # We'll search c from large values downward
    for c in range(20, -21, -1):  # Reasonable range based on problem constraints
        found = False
        # Check if there exist a, b, d satisfying both equations
        # From first equation: a = 20 - b*c
        # Substitute into second equation: -(20 - b*c) + c*d = 19 => c*(b + d) = 39
        # So c must divide 39
        if 39 % c != 0:
            continue
        # Now check if we can find integer b and d
        quotient = 39 // c
        # We can choose b arbitrarily and set d = quotient - b
        # Then a = 20 - b*c
        # Since b can be any integer, solution exists for any c dividing 39
        print(f"Found valid c = {c}")
        found = True
        # Since we're searching in descending order, first found is greatest
        if found:
            print(f"The greatest integer c is {c}")
            return

solve()
```
