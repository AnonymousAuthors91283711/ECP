[write_program]
The problem asks to count the number of integers `n` between 1 and 1000 for which the central binomial coefficient `C(2n, n)` divided by 2 is even. We'll write a Python program to enumerate these values and count them.

Key observations:
1. The central binomial coefficient is `centralBinom(n) = C(2n, n) = (2n)!/(n!)^2`
2. We need to compute `centralBinom(n)/2` and check if it's even
3. We'll compute this for n from 1 to 1000 and count the matches

```python
import math

def central_binom(n):
    return math.comb(2*n, n)

count = 0
for n in range(1, 1001):
    cb = central_binom(n)
    if (cb // 2) % 2 == 0:
        count += 1
        print(f"Found match at n={n}")  # Streaming partial results

print(f"Total count: {count}")  # Final answer
```
