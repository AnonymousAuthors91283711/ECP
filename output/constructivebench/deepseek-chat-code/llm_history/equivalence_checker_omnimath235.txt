Ground Truth Answer: {n | n ≡ 0 [MOD 8] ∨ n ≡ 3 [MOD 8]}
Proposed Answer: {n | ∃ k : ℕ, n = 5 * k ∧ 0 < k}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding natural numbers n > 0 where the ratio of boys' matches to girls' matches is 7/5.

2. The ground truth answer states that solutions occur when n ≡ 0 mod 8 or n ≡ 3 mod 8.

3. The proposed answer claims solutions are all positive multiples of 5.

Let's test some values:
- n=8 (≡0 mod8): 
  total = (3*8*23)/2 = 276
  girls = (8*7)/2 + 2*64 = 28+128 = 156
  boys = 120
  120/156 ≈ 0.769 ≈ 7/5? No, 7/5=1.4. Doesn't match.

Wait, this suggests the ground truth might be incorrect. But let's check n=5 (proposed answer):
- n=5:
  total = (3*5*14)/2 = 105
  girls = (5*4)/2 + 2*25 = 10+50 = 60
  boys = 45
  45/60 = 0.75 ≠ 7/5 (1.4)

Neither answer seems correct based on these calculations. However, the proposed answer (multiples of 5) is clearly wrong as shown by n=5. The ground truth might also be incorrect, but it's closer to the actual condition needed.
