[write_program]
This problem asks to determine if there exist integers a and b such that both a^5*b + 3 and a*b^5 + 3 are perfect cubes. We'll write a program to search for small integer solutions.

The approach is:
1. Iterate through possible small integer values of a and b
2. Check if both expressions are perfect cubes
3. Print any found solutions

We'll limit the search to a reasonable range (-100 to 100) for demonstration purposes.

```python
def is_perfect_cube(n):
    """Check if n is a perfect cube."""
    if n == 0:
        return True
    abs_n = abs(n)
    k = round(abs_n ** (1/3))
    return k ** 3 == abs_n and (n > 0 or k == -k)

def search_solutions():
    """Search for integer solutions where both a^5*b +3 and a*b^5 +3 are cubes."""
    print("Searching for solutions where both a^5*b +3 and a*b^5 +3 are cubes:")
    search_range = range(-100, 101)
    for a in search_range:
        for b in search_range:
            if a == 0 or b == 0:  # Skip trivial cases
                continue
            expr1 = a**5 * b + 3
            expr2 = a * b**5 + 3
            if is_perfect_cube(expr1) and is_perfect_cube(expr2):
                print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}")
                print(f"  a^5*b +3 = {expr1} = {round(expr1 ** (1/3))}^3")
                print(f"  a*b^5 +3 = {expr2} = {round(expr2 ** (1/3))}^3")
    print("Search completed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    search_solutions()
```
