The error occurs because the proposed answer tries to use a variable `a` that isn't declared in the scope of the definition. Since `omnimath4324_answer` is a standalone proposition, it shouldn't depend on any external variables. The correct answer should express the property that any locally periodic sequence is globally periodic, without referring to a specific sequence.

Looking at the enumerated answers, we see that sequences that are locally periodic (having periodic behavior from every starting point) are also globally periodic (having a single period that works for all points). This suggests the answer should be about the existence of a common period.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<∀ (a : ℕ → ℕ), (∀ k, ∃ t, ∀ m, a (k + m * t) = a k) → ∃ T, ∀ k, a (k + T) = a k>>>

This states that for any sequence `a`, if for every starting point `k` there exists some period `t` (that may depend on `k`), then there exists a common period `T` that works for all starting points `k`. This matches the pattern observed in the enumerated examples where locally periodic sequences were all globally periodic.
