This problem involves finding the sum of squared roots divided by the sum of squared other roots for a quartic polynomial. We'll write a Python program to compute this value numerically for the given polynomial.

The approach is:
1. Find all roots of the polynomial numerically
2. For each root, compute the required ratio
3. Sum these ratios
4. Output the result

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.polynomial import Polynomial

# Define the polynomial: x^4 - 4x^3 + 8x^2 - 7x + 3
p = Polynomial([3, -7, 8, -4, 1])

# Find all roots (including complex ones)
roots = p.roots()

# Compute the required sum
total = 0.0
for i in range(4):
    r_i = roots[i]
    # Sum of squares of other roots
    sum_other_squares = sum(r_j**2 for j in range(4) if j != i)
    if abs(sum_other_squares) > 1e-10:  # Avoid division by zero
        term = (r_i**2) / sum_other_squares
        total += term
        print(f"Processing root {i+1}: {term:.6f}")

# Print final result
print(f"\nFinal sum: {total:.6f}")
```

Judgement:
The original program is rejected because:
1. It doesn't handle the case where roots might be repeated (the polynomial has a double root at 1)
2. The output format doesn't match the requirements (should print each answer immediately)
3. The final sum is printed with unnecessary decimal places when an exact value exists
4. The program doesn't properly handle the case where sum_other_squares might be zero (which happens with repeated roots)

The polynomial x^4 - 4x^3 + 8x^2 - 7x + 3 factors as (x-1)^2(x^2-2x+3), with roots 1 (double root), 1+√2i, and 1-√2i. The exact sum should be computed symbolically rather than numerically.

<<<False>>>

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.polynomial import Polynomial

# Define the polynomial: x^4 - 4x^3 + 8x^2 - 7x + 3
p = Polynomial([3, -7, 8, -4, 1])

# Find all roots (including complex ones)
roots = p.roots()

# Compute the required sum
total = 0.0
for i in range(4):
    r_i = roots[i]
    # Sum of squares of other roots (handling multiplicity)
    sum_other_squares = sum(r_j**2 for j in range(4) - r_i**2
    if abs(sum_other_squares) > 1e-10:
        term = (r_i**2) / sum_other_squares
        total += term
        print(term)  # Print each term immediately

# Print final result (exact value is 1, but we output computed value)
print(total)
```

Judgement:
1. The original program has a syntax error in the line `sum_other_squares = sum(r_j**2 for j in range(4) - r_i**2` - missing closing parenthesis and incorrect subtraction.
2. The program doesn't properly handle the case where sum_other_squares might be zero (division by zero).
3. The output is empty due to the syntax error preventing execution.
4. The problem requires computing a sum involving roots of a polynomial, and the approach is conceptually correct but needs proper implementation.

<<<False>>>

Here's the corrected program:

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.polynomial import Polynomial

# Define the polynomial: x^4 - 4x^3 + 8x^2 - 7x + 3
p = Polynomial([3, -7, 8, -4, 1])

# Find all roots (including complex ones)
roots = p.roots()

# Compute the required sum
total = 0.0
for i in range(4):
    r_i = roots[i]
    # Sum of squares of other roots
    sum_other_squares = sum(r_j**2 for j in range(4) if j != i)
    if abs(sum_other_squares) > 1e-10:  # Avoid division by zero
        term = (r_i**2) / sum_other_squares
        total += term
        print(term)  # Print each term immediately

# Print final result
print("Final sum:", total)
```
