[write_program]
This problem asks for the largest natural number n such that within the interval [n, n+100], there exists a perfect square k^2 that divides the product of all numbers in that interval. We'll write a Python program to search for such numbers by checking intervals and looking for square divisors.

The approach:
1. For each n, compute the product of numbers in [n, n+100]
2. Check if any k in [n, n+100] has k^2 dividing the product
3. Track the largest n satisfying this condition

We'll optimize by:
- Using logarithms to avoid computing huge products directly
- Checking divisibility by k^2 for each k in the interval
- Stopping when we find no more solutions after a reasonable threshold

```python
import math
from math import prod, log, isqrt

def find_max_n(threshold=1000):
    max_n = 0
    for n in range(1, threshold + 1):
        interval = range(n, n + 101)
        # Compute log of product to avoid huge numbers
        log_product = sum(math.log(i) for i in interval)
        found = False
        for k in interval:
            log_k_squared = 2 * math.log(k)
            if log_k_squared > log_product:
                continue  # k^2 is larger than product
            # Now check exact divisibility
            product = prod(interval)
            if product % (k * k) == 0:
                found = True
                break
        if found:
            max_n = n
            print(f"Found valid n: {n}")
    print(f"Maximum n found: {max_n}")

find_max_n(2000)  # Adjust threshold if needed
```
