[write_program]
This problem involves calculating a simple fraction expression. We'll write a Python program to compute the exact value of the expression `1 - 7/10 - (1/3)*(1 - 7/10)` using exact rational arithmetic to avoid floating-point approximations.

The program will:
1. Compute the remainder after the first subtraction
2. Calculate how much Maria took (1/3 of remainder)
3. Compute the final result by subtracting both values from 1
4. Print the exact rational result in reduced form

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_expression():
    # Compute each step using exact fractions
    remainder = Fraction(1, 1) - Fraction(7, 10)
    maria_took = Fraction(1, 3) * remainder
    result = Fraction(1, 1) - Fraction(7, 10) - maria_took
    
    # Print the exact reduced fraction
    print(f"Exact result: {result.numerator}/{result.denominator}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_expression()
```
