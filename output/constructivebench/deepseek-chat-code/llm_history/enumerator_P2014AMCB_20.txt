[write_program]
The problem asks to count the number of positive integers x satisfying:
1. x > 40 (since log(x-40) must be defined)
2. x < 60 (since log(60-x) must be defined)
3. log(x-40) + log(60-x) < 2

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Iterate through all integers x from 41 to 59 (inclusive)
2. Check if log(x-40) + log(60-x) < 2
3. Count and print valid x values
4. Finally print the count

```python
import math

count = 0
print("Valid x values:")
for x in range(41, 60):
    term1 = math.log10(x - 40)
    term2 = math.log10(60 - x)
    if term1 + term2 < 2:
        print(x)
        count += 1

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
