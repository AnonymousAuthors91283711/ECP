This problem asks for the number of 4-element subsets of {0,1,...,20} that contain at least one pair summing to 16 and at least one pair summing to 24. We'll enumerate all possible 4-element subsets and count those satisfying both conditions.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def solve():
    count = 0
    universe = range(21)  # 0 to 20 inclusive
    target1 = 16
    target2 = 24
    
    for subset in combinations(universe, 4):
        has_pair1 = False
        has_pair2 = False
        
        # Check for pair summing to 16
        for i in range(4):
            for j in range(i+1, 4):
                if subset[i] + subset[j] == target1:
                    has_pair1 = True
                    break
            if has_pair1:
                break
        
        # Check for pair summing to 24
        for i in range(4):
            for j in range(i+1, 4):
                if subset[i] + subset[j] == target2:
                    has_pair2 = True
                    break
            if has_pair2:
                break
        
        if has_pair1 and has_pair2:
            count += 1
            print(subset)  # Print valid subsets as they're found
    
    print("Total count:", count)

solve()
```
