This problem involves solving a logarithmic equation with base 6. We need to find all real x that satisfy the equation and verify if there's a unique solution. The equation combines logarithms with different bases (6 and 6Â²=36) of expressions involving x.

We'll:
1. Use logarithm properties to combine terms
2. Solve the resulting equation
3. Check for valid solutions (arguments must be positive)

```python
import math

def is_valid_solution(x):
    """Check if x satisfies the domain conditions of the original equation"""
    return (x - 7 > 0) and (x - 2 > 0)

def solve_equation():
    """Find and print valid solutions to the logarithmic equation"""
    # We'll test values around where we expect solutions
    # Using small steps for precision
    step = 0.0001
    start = 7.1  # Must be >7 for sqrt(x-7) to be real
    end = 20.0   # Arbitrary upper bound
    
    solutions = []
    x = start
    while x <= end:
        if is_valid_solution(x):
            term1 = math.log(math.sqrt(x - 7), 6)
            term2 = math.log(x - 2, 36)
            total = term1 + term2
            # Check if total is approximately 1 (accounting for floating point)
            if abs(total - 1) < 1e-6:
                solutions.append(x)
                print(f"Found solution: x = {x}")
        x += step
    
    if solutions:
        print("\nValid solutions found:")
        for sol in solutions:
            print(f"x = {sol}")
    else:
        print("No valid solutions found in the tested range")
