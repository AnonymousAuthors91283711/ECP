This problem involves complex numbers and a sum over a large range (3^1010). For practical enumeration, we'll use a smaller exponent (like n=3) to find patterns. The key is evaluating the sum for different z values to identify roots.

```python
import cmath
from itertools import product

def digits(n, base):
    """Return digits of n in given base as list."""
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    d = []
    while n > 0:
        d.append(n % base)
        n = n // base
    return d

def count_ones_in_ternary(n):
    """Count number of 1's in ternary representation of n."""
    return digits(n, 3).count(1)

def compute_sum(z, max_k_power):
    """Compute the sum for given z up to 3^max_k_power."""
    total = 0
    max_k = 3 ** max_k_power
    for k in range(max_k):
        coeff = (-2) ** count_ones_in_ternary(k)
        term = coeff * (z + k) ** 2023
        total += term
    return total

def find_roots(max_k_power=3, sample_points=10):
    """Find approximate roots by sampling complex plane."""
    # Sample points in a small region (adjust as needed)
    for real in range(-5, 6):
        for imag in range(-5, 6):
            z = complex(real, imag)
            s = compute_sum(z, max_k_power)
            if abs(s) < 1e-6:  # Threshold for "close to zero"
                print(f"Potential root found: {z}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Searching for roots with max_k_power=3...")
    find_roots()
    print("Note: For exact results, higher precision and symbolic computation would be needed.")
```
