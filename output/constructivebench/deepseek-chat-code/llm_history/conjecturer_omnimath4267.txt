abbrev omnimath4267_answer : Set (ℤ × ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath4267 :
  {p : ℤ × ℤ | 7 * p.1 + 14 * p.2 = 5 * p.1 ^ 2 + 5 * p.1 * p.2 + 5 * p.2 ^ 2} = omnimath4267_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for integer solutions (x, y) to 7x + 14y = 5x² + 5xy + 5y²
Found solution: (-1, 3)
Found solution: (0, 0)
Found solution: (1, 2). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ)
<<<{(0, 0), (-1, 3), (1, 2), (3, -1), (2, 1)}>>>
