Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
From the enumerated answers, we can observe that numbers from 1 to 10 have single-digit representations, while numbers above 10 have two-digit representations where the first digit is the remainder when divided by 10 and the second digit is the quotient. This suggests the set of numbers that don't have leading zeros in their base-10 representation.
