[write_program]
This problem asks to compute the sum f(0) + f(1) where f(x) = x²(1-x)². The solution involves evaluating the function at these two points and summing the results. The Python program will compute this directly.

```python
def f(x):
    return x**2 * (1 - x)**2

# Evaluate at 0 and 1, then sum
result = f(0) + f(1)
print(result)
```
