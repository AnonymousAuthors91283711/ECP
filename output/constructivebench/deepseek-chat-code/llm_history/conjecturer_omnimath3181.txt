Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the enumerated triples, we can observe that the count of valid triples follows a pattern based on combinations of exponents of 3. The total number of triples appears to be the sum of combinations where the exponents satisfy certain divisibility conditions. The pattern suggests the answer is the sum of triangular numbers up to 7 (since we have exponents 1 through 8).
