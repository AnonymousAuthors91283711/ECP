This problem involves calculating a probability sum and finding coprime integers m,n such that their sum equals the answer. We'll compute the joint probability sum for x from 1 to 6 (since prob(0)=0 and prob(k)=0 for k>6) and find the reduced fraction.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from math import gcd

def prob(k):
    return k if 1 <= k <= 6 else 0

# Calculate total weight
total_weight = sum(prob(k) for k in range(7))

# Calculate normalized probabilities
norm_prob = [Fraction(prob(k), total_weight) for k in range(7)]

# Calculate the joint probability sum
sum_joint = Fraction(0, 1)
for x in range(1, 7):
    sum_joint += norm_prob[x] * norm_prob[7 - x]

# Reduce the fraction
m = sum_joint.numerator
n = sum_joint.denominator
common_divisor = gcd(m, n)
m_reduced = m // common_divisor
n_reduced = n // common_divisor

print(f"Sum of joint probabilities: {sum_joint}")
print(f"Reduced fraction: {m_reduced}/{n_reduced}")
print(f"Answer (m + n): {m_reduced + n_reduced}")
```
