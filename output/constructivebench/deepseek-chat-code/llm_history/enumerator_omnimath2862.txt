This problem asks for the number of positive integer pairs (x, y) that satisfy the equation x/4 = 9/y, which can be rewritten as x*y = 36. We need to count all positive integer factor pairs of 36.

The approach is to:
1. Find all factor pairs (x, y) of 36 where x, y > 0
2. Count the number of such pairs
3. Since x and y are symmetric, we can iterate x from 1 to 36 and check if 36 is divisible by x

```python
def count_factor_pairs():
    count = 0
    for x in range(1, 37):  # x can be at most 36
        if 36 % x == 0:
            y = 36 // x
            if y > 0:
                print(f"Found pair: ({x}, {y})")
                count += 1
    print(f"Total number of pairs: {count}")

count_factor_pairs()
```
