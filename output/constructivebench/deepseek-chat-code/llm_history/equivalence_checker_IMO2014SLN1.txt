theorem IMO2014SLN1 (n : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) :
  IsGreatest {m : ℕ | ¬ ∃ (s : Finset ℕ), (∀ k ∈ s, k < n) ∧ m = ∑ k in s, (2^n - 2^k)} (IMO2014SLN1_answer n) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n - 2) * 2^n + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (n - 1) * 2^n
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the greatest natural number m such that m cannot be expressed as a sum of distinct terms of the form (2^n - 2^k) where k < n.

2. The ground truth answer is (n-2)*2^n + 1
3. The proposed answer is (n-1)*2^n

Key differences:
- The ground truth has (n-2) while proposed has (n-1)
- The ground truth adds +1 at the end
- The proposed answer is always larger than the ground truth for n ≥ 2

Testing with n=2:
- Ground truth: (2-2)*2^2 + 1 = 1
- Proposed: (2-1)*2^2 = 4
But the correct answer should be 1 (as 1 cannot be expressed as such a sum, while 4 can be expressed as (4-2)+(4-1)=2+3=5 which is invalid, but actually 4 can be expressed as (4-2)=2, so this shows the proposed answer is incorrect)

The proposed answer is clearly different from and incorrect compared to the ground truth.
