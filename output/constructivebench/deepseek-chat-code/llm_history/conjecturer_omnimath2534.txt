abbrev omnimath2534_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2534
(h a r v m i t : ℝ)
(hard : h * a * r * v * a * r * d = 100 ∧ m * i * t = 100 ∧ h * m * m * t = 100)
: (r * a * d) * (t * r * i * v * i * a) = omnimath2534_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: The expression simplifies to: 10000

Sample verification with:
a=2, r=3, d=5, v=7, i=11
Computed h=5/63, m=693/5, t=500/7623

Checking original equations:
Equation 1: 100 = 100
Equation 2: 100 = 100
Equation 3: 100 = 100

Target expression value: 10000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<10000>>>
