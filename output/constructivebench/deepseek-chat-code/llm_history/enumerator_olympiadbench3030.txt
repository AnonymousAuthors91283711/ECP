[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of equations with real numbers. We'll write a Python program to numerically verify the solution by substituting the given equations and checking consistency. The key steps are:
1. Use the given T value (1/40)
2. Solve for x and y using x+y=5 and x²-y²=40
3. Find z using x-z=-7
4. Compute x+z

```python
def solve_problem():
    T = 1 / 40
    # Given x + y = 5 and x^2 - y^2 = 1/T = 40
    # x^2 - y^2 = (x+y)(x-y) = 5*(x-y) = 40 => x-y = 8
    # Now we have:
    # x + y = 5
    # x - y = 8
    # Adding: 2x = 13 => x = 6.5
    x = (5 + 8) / 2
    y = 5 - x
    # Given x - z = -7 => z = x + 7
    z = x + 7
    # Compute x + z
    result = x + z
    print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}, z = {z}")
    print(f"x + z = {result}")
