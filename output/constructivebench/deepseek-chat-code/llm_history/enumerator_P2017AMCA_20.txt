This problem involves finding pairs (a, b) where a is a positive real number and b is an integer between 2 and 200, such that (log_b a)^2017 = log_b (a^2017) b. We need to count the number of such valid pairs.

Key observations:
1. The equation simplifies using logarithm properties: (log_b a)^2017 = (2017 * log_b a) / log_b b
2. Since log_b b = 1, this becomes (log_b a)^2017 = 2017 * log_b a
3. Let x = log_b a, then x^2017 = 2017x
4. Solutions are x=0 or x^2016 = 2017
5. x=0 implies a=1 (since b^0=1)
6. x^2016=2017 implies a = b^(Â±2017^(1/2016))

We'll enumerate all integer b values from 2 to 200 and check valid a values.

```python
import math

def count_solutions():
    count = 0
    for b in range(2, 201):
        # Case 1: a = 1 (x=0 solution)
        count += 1
        
        # Case 2: x^2016 = 2017
        # a = b^(2017^(1/2016)) or a = b^(-2017^(1/2016))
        # Since a must be positive, both cases are valid
        count += 2
    
    print(f"Total solutions: {count}")

count_solutions()
```
