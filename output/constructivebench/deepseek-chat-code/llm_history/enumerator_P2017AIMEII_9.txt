[write_program]
This problem involves counting valid and "good" hands in a combinatorics scenario. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible fractions p/q where p is the count of good hands and q is the count of valid hands, looking for the simplified form p'/q' where p' + q' matches the answer.

The problem involves:
- A deck of 49 cards (7 colors Ã— 7 numbers)
- Valid hands: 8-card subsets containing at least one card of each color and number
- Good hands: valid hands where removing any one card still leaves at least one of each color and number

We'll use itertools to generate combinations and check conditions.

```python
import itertools
from math import gcd
from collections import defaultdict

def main():
    colors = 7
    numbers = 7
    deck = [(c, n) for c in range(colors) for n in range(numbers)]
    
    # Precompute all 8-card subsets that are valid hands
    valid_hands = []
    for hand in itertools.combinations(deck, 8):
        has_color = [False] * colors
        has_number = [False] * numbers
        for (c, n) in hand:
            has_color[c] = True
            has_number[n] = True
        if all(has_color) and all(has_number):
            valid_hands.append(hand)
    
    q = len(valid_hands)
    print(f"Total valid hands (q): {q}")
    
    # Check which valid hands are good hands
    good_hands = 0
    for hand in valid_hands:
        is_good = True
        for card in hand:
            # Check if removing this card maintains both conditions
            remaining = [c for c in hand if c != card]
            has_color = [False] * colors
            has_number = [False] * numbers
            for (c, n) in remaining:
                has_color[c] = True
                has_number[n] = True
            if not (all(has_color) and all(has_number)):
                is_good = False
                break
        if is_good:
            good_hands += 1
    
    p = good_hands
    print(f"Good hands (p): {p}")
    
    # Simplify fraction p/q
    common_divisor = gcd(p, q)
    p_prime = p // common_divisor
    q_prime = q // common_divisor
    
    print(f"Simplified fraction: {p_prime}/{q_prime}")
    print(f"Final answer (p' + q'): {p_prime + q_prime}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
