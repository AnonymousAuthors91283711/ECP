This problem asks for the number of ordered pairs of positive integers (m, n) such that m² × n = 20²⁰. We'll factorize 20²⁰ and enumerate all possible factorizations into m² and n.

The prime factorization of 20 is 2² × 5, so 20²⁰ = (2² × 5)²⁰ = 2⁴⁰ × 5²⁰. For m² × n = 2⁴⁰ × 5²⁰, m² must be of form 2²a × 5²b where 0 ≤ a ≤ 20 and 0 ≤ b ≤ 10 (since m² can't have odd exponents). Then n will be 2⁴⁰⁻²a × 5²⁰⁻²b.

The number of possible pairs is the number of choices for a (0 to 20) multiplied by choices for b (0 to 10), giving (21 × 11) = 231 pairs.

```python
def count_pairs():
    # Count pairs (m,n) where m^2 * n = 20^20
    # 20^20 = 2^40 * 5^20
    # m^2 must be 2^(2a) * 5^(2b) where 0<=a<=20, 0<=b<=10
    count = 0
    for a in range(0, 21):  # exponent of 2 in m^2 (must be even)
        for b in range(0, 11):  # exponent of 5 in m^2 (must be even)
            count += 1
    print(count)
