[write_program]
The problem is to compute the value of the expression \((-2)^3 - (-3)^2\). This is a straightforward arithmetic calculation, but we'll write a Python program to verify it.

```python
# Compute (-2)^3 - (-3)^2
result = (-2) ** 3 - (-3) ** 2
print(result)
```

The program calculates:
1. \((-2)^3 = -8\)
2. \((-3)^2 = 9\)
3. \(-8 - 9 = -17\)

The output will be -17, which is the correct answer.
