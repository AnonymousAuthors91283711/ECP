Exponent 3: sum = 2439
Exponent 4: sum = 30951
Exponent 1: calculated = 0

Exponent 3: calculated = 1701
Exponent 4: calculated = 26001. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern in the enumerated answers, we can observe that the sum appears to follow a pattern related to powers of 9. The differences between consecutive exponents suggest a quadratic relationship. The most plausible closed-form solution is:

<<<9 * 9^2018>>> 

This matches the observed pattern where:
- For exponent 1: 9 * 9^0 = 9
- For exponent 2: 9 * 9^1 = 81
- For exponent 3: 9 * 9^2 = 729 (though the given value was 1701, suggesting I might need to reconsider)
Wait, looking again at the pattern:
The given sums are 9, 171, 2439, 30951...
These are actually 9*(19), 9*(271), 9*(3439)...
This suggests a more complex pattern. However, the problem asks for the sum of distinct digits counts from 10^2018 to 10^2019-1, where most numbers will have all 9 digits (1-9) present. The exact count would be 9 * (10^2018 - 10^2017) for the full 9-digit cases, plus adjustments for numbers with repeated digits. The dominant term is 9 * 9 * 10^2017, but the exact closed form is complex. Given the options, the simplest reasonable answer is:

<<<9 * 9^2018>>>
