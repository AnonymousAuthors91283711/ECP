This problem involves a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. We need to compute a(2012) given a(0)=2 and the recurrence relation a(n+1) = a(n)/(1 + a(n)). 

To solve this, we'll:
1. Compute the sequence up to a reasonable number of terms to observe the pattern
2. Look for a closed-form solution or pattern
3. The exact value can likely be expressed as 2/(1 + 2n) for a(n), but we'll verify this

Here's the Python program to enumerate the sequence values:

```python
def compute_sequence(n_terms):
    a = 2.0  # initial value a(0) = 2
    for n in range(n_terms + 1):
        print(f"a({n}) = {a}")
        a = a / (1 + a)

# Compute first 20 terms to observe the pattern
compute_sequence(20)
```

The output will show the sequence converging to 0, but more importantly, we can observe that each term follows the pattern a(n) = 2/(1 + 2n). This suggests the closed-form solution, which for n=2012 would be 2/(1 + 2*2012) = 2/4025. The program helps verify this pattern by showing the first few terms match this formula.
