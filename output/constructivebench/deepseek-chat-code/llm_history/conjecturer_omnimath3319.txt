The error occurs because Lean can't directly convert a negative exponent with a natural number base to a real number. We need to explicitly cast the base 2 to a real number first. The pattern from the enumerated answers suggests the answer is 2 raised to the negative power of n (2004 in this case).

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<(2 : ℝ) ^ (-2004)>>>

Explanation:
1. The error message indicates Lean can't handle negative exponents with natural numbers (ℕ), so we need to work with real numbers (ℝ)
2. We cast the base 2 to ℝ using `(2 : ℝ)`
3. The exponent remains -2004, but now operates on a real number base
4. The enumerated answers show the numerical product equals 2^(-n), confirming this pattern
5. The answer matches the expected type ℝ as required by the theorem statement

This maintains the mathematical correctness while satisfying Lean's type system requirements.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

2^(-n) = 0.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Looking at the error message, the issue is that Lean can't automatically convert a negative exponent for natural numbers. We need to explicitly cast the exponent to ℝ. The pattern from the enumerated answers suggests the answer is 2^(-n), but we need to handle the types correctly.

The key points:
1. The enumerated answers show the product equals 2^(-n) numerically
2. The error occurs because (-2004) is treated as ℕ by default
3. We need to ensure both the base and exponent are ℝ

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<(2 : ℝ) ^ (-(2004 : ℝ))>>>

Alternatively, we could write it as:
<<<(2 : ℝ) ^ (-2004 : ℝ)>>>

Both versions properly handle the type conversion by explicitly marking the exponent as ℝ. The first version casts 2004 to ℝ before negation, while the second version casts the entire -2004 to ℝ. Either approach resolves the type error while maintaining the mathematical correctness of the answer.
