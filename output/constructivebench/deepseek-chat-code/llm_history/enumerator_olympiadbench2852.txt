[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number k ≥ 3 such that there are at least 2009 distinct real-valued functions x from {1,...,k} to ℝ where for every coordinate i, the product of all coordinates equals the square of the i-th coordinate.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. For each k starting from 3 upwards, count the number of valid solutions
2. Stop when we find the smallest k where the count reaches at least 2009
3. The solutions must satisfy ∏x_j = x_i² for all i

Key observations:
- The condition implies all x_i must be equal or some are zero
- For non-zero solutions, setting all x_i = c gives c^k = c² ⇒ c^(k-2) = 1
- Zero solutions are valid when at least two coordinates are zero
- We need to count all possible combinations

```python
def count_solutions(k):
    # Count non-zero solutions: c can be 0, 1, or -1 (when k-2 is even)
    nonzero = 0
    if k >= 2:
        nonzero = 1  # c=0 case (all zeros)
        if (k-2) % 2 == 0:
            nonzero += 2  # c=1 and c=-1
        else:
            nonzero += 1  # just c=1
    
    # Count zero solutions: at least two zeros, others arbitrary
    # This is sum_{m=2 to k} C(k,m) * ∞^(k-m) but we can represent as ∞
    # For counting purposes, we consider it as exceeding 2009 when k >= 2
    
    # Since zero solutions give infinite possibilities, once k >= 2 we have ∞ > 2009
    return float('inf') if k >= 2 else 0

def find_min_k():
    for k in range(3, 20):  # We know answer must be small
        cnt = count_solutions(k)
        print(f"k={k}, solutions={cnt}")
        if cnt > 2009:
            print(f"Found minimal k: {k}")
            return

find_min_k()
```

The program shows that for k=3, we already have infinite solutions (since zero solutions are allowed), which exceeds 2009. Therefore, the minimal k satisfying the condition is 3. The output will show this progression and identify k=3 as the answer.
