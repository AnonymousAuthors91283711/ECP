This problem asks for the number of distinct real solutions (x,y) that satisfy a system of four polynomial equations. We'll enumerate all possible combinations by solving each equation and checking intersections.

```python
from itertools import product

def solve_equation1():
    # y^4 - y^2 = 0 => y^2(y^2 - 1) = 0
    return [0, 1, -1]

def solve_equation2():
    # x*y^3 - x*y = 0 => x*y(y^2 - 1) = 0
    # Solutions when x=0 or y=0 or y=±1
    return None  # Will be handled in combinations

def solve_equation3():
    # x^3*y - x*y = 0 => x*y(x^2 - 1) = 0
    # Solutions when x=0 or y=0 or x=±1
    return None  # Will be handled in combinations

def solve_equation4():
    # x^4 - x^2 = 0 => x^2(x^2 - 1) = 0
    return [0, 1, -1]

def main():
    y_solutions = solve_equation1()
    x_solutions = solve_equation4()
    
    # Generate all possible (x,y) pairs from base solutions
    candidates = set()
    for x in x_solutions:
        for y in y_solutions:
            # Check all equations are satisfied
            if (y**4 - y**2 == 0 and 
                x*y**3 - x*y == 0 and 
                x**3*y - x*y == 0 and 
                x**4 - x**2 == 0):
                candidates.add((x,y))
    
    # Also consider cases where x or y might be other values when multiplied by 0
    # Check x=0 with any y (from equation2 and equation3)
    for y in [-2, -1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2]:  # Test some additional values
        x = 0
        if (y**4 - y**2 == 0 and 
            0 == 0 and  # From equation2 and equation3
            0 == 0 and 
            0 == 0):    # From equation4
            candidates.add((x,y))
    
    # Check y=0 with any x (from equation2 and equation3)
    for x in [-2, -1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2]:  # Test some additional values
        y = 0
        if (0 == 0 and  # From equation1
            0 == 0 and  # From equation2 and equation3
            0 == 0 and  # From equation3
            x**4 - x**2 == 0):
            candidates.add((x,y))
    
    # Print all distinct solutions found
    for sol in sorted(candidates):
        print(sol)
    
    print(f"Total number of solutions: {len(candidates)}")
