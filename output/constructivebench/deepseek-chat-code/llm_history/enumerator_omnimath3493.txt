The problem asks to find the least value in the set {x, x+2, x/2, x-2, 2x} for x < -2. We need to enumerate and compare these expressions for sample x values to identify the pattern.

For x < -2:
1. x is negative
2. x+2 is negative (since x < -2 ⇒ x+2 < 0)
3. x/2 is negative (x negative divided by positive 2)
4. x-2 is negative (x < -2 ⇒ x-2 < -4)
5. 2x is negative (x negative times positive 2)

We'll test sample x values to see which expression gives the minimum (least) value.

```python
def find_min_for_x(x):
    candidates = [x, x + 2, x / 2, x - 2, 2 * x]
    min_val = min(candidates)
    print(f"For x = {x}:")
    print(f"  Candidates: {candidates}")
    print(f"  Minimum: {min_val} (from {candidates.index(min_val)})")
    print()

# Test with sample x values less than -2
sample_x = [-3, -4, -5, -10]
for x in sample_x:
    find_min_for_x(x)

# After observing the pattern, we can see that for x < -2, 2x is always the minimum
# So the omnimath3493_answer function should return 2*x
```
