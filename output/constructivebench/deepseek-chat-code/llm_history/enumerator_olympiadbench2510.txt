This problem involves finding a natural number `n` such that the sum of `logb 100 (1 + 1/x)` for `x` from 81 to 99 equals twice `logb 100 (1 + 1/n)`. 

We'll approach this by:
1. Recognizing that `logb 100 (a) + logb 100 (b) = logb 100 (a*b)`
2. Converting the sum into a product inside the logarithm
3. Simplifying the product to find a pattern
4. Comparing with the right-hand side to find `n`

The key observation is that the product telescopes to (100/81), making the equation simplify to finding `n` where (100/81) = (1 + 1/n)^2.

```python
import math

def log_base_100(x):
    return math.log(x) / math.log(100)

def compute_sum():
    product = 1.0
    for x in range(81, 100):
        product *= (1 + 1/x)
    return log_base_100(product)

def find_n():
    sum_value = compute_sum()
    print(f"Sum of logs: {sum_value}")
    
    # We're looking for n where 2*log(1+1/n) = sum_value
    # Which means (1+1/n)^2 = product
    product = 100/81  # The telescoping product
    target = math.sqrt(product)
    n = 1 / (target - 1)
    
    # Check if n is integer
    if n.is_integer():
        return int(n)
    else:
        # Find closest integer candidates
        n_floor = int(n)
        n_ceil = n_floor + 1
        return [n_floor, n_ceil]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    candidates = find_n()
    print("Candidate values for n:", candidates)
```
