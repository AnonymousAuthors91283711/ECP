abbrev omnimath742_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath742 :
    IsLeast
    {n : ℕ | Real.sqrt (n + 99) - Real.sqrt n < 1}
    omnimath742_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found candidate: 2402
Verification: sqrt(2402+99) - sqrt(2402) = 0.9997959808285657 < 1
Minimal n satisfying the condition: 2402. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
