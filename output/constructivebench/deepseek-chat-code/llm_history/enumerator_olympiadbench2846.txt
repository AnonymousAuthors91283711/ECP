[write_program]
The problem asks to find the largest two-digit number N (between 10 and 99) such that:
1. The reverse of N is prime
2. The reverse of 4*N is prime
3. The reverse of 5*N is prime

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such numbers and identify the maximum one. The program will:
1. Iterate through numbers 10 to 99 in reverse order (to find the maximum faster)
2. For each number, compute its reverse, reverse of 4*N, and reverse of 5*N
3. Check if all three reversed numbers are prime
4. Print qualifying numbers and finally output the maximum found

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n in (2, 3):
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for p in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % p == 0:
            return False
    return True

def reverse_number(n):
    return int(str(n)[::-1])

max_n = None
for n in range(99, 9, -1):
    rev_n = reverse_number(n)
    rev_4n = reverse_number(4 * n)
    rev_5n = reverse_number(5 * n)
    
    if is_prime(rev_n) and is_prime(rev_4n) and is_prime(rev_5n):
        print(f"Found valid N: {n} (reversed: {rev_n}, {rev_4n}, {rev_5n})")
        if max_n is None:
            max_n = n

if max_n is not None:
    print(f"\nMaximum valid N: {max_n}")
else:
    print("No valid N found in range")
```
