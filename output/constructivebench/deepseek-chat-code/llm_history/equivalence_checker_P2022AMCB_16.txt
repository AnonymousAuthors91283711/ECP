Ground Truth Answer: 3 + sqrt 2
Proposed Answer: (logb 2 (2^8)) / (logb 2 (2^(1/2)))
Let's analyze the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

1. Ground Truth Answer: 3 + √2 ≈ 4.4142

2. Proposed Answer: (logb 2 (2^8)) / (logb 2 (2^(1/2))) = 8 / (1/2) = 16

The proposed answer simplifies to 16, which is clearly different from 3 + √2 ≈ 4.4142. The two answers are not equivalent.
