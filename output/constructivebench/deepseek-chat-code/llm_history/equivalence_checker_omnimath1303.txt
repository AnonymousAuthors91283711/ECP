theorem omnimath1303 : 
  ∑ k in Finset.range 100, (1 / (2 * ⌊sqrt (k + 1 : ℝ)⌋ + 1 : ℚ)) = omnimath1303_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 190/21
Proposed Answer: (100 : ℚ) / 21
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves summing reciprocals of odd numbers related to floor functions of square roots from k=0 to 99.

2. The ground truth answer is 190/21 ≈ 9.0476

3. The proposed answer is 100/21 ≈ 4.7619

4. The proposed answer is significantly smaller than the ground truth answer.

5. The proposed answer doesn't account for the fact that many terms in the sum have denominators smaller than 21 (since ⌊√(k+1)⌋ can be much smaller than 10 for lower values of k).

6. The proposed answer seems to incorrectly assume all denominators are 21 (which would correspond to ⌊√(k+1)⌋=10), but in reality, the denominators vary from 1 to 21.
