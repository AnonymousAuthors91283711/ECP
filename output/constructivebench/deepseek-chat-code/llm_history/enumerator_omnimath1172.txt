[write_program]
This problem involves counting the sum of the number of distinct elements in the orbit of each function from Fin 2021 to Fin 2021, modulo 2017. We'll write a Python program to enumerate smaller cases and look for patterns.

The key observation is that for a function f: Fin n → Fin n, the number of distinct elements in the orbit {f^2021(k) | k ∈ Fin n} equals the number of periodic points with period dividing gcd(2021, cycle_length). Since 2021 = 43 × 47, we can simplify the analysis.

We'll compute smaller cases where n and the exponent are smaller, then look for patterns modulo the given prime.

```python
from math import gcd
from itertools import product
from collections import defaultdict

def count_distinct_orbit_elements(n, exponent):
    """Count sum of distinct orbit elements for all functions f:[n]->[n]"""
    total = 0
    # Iterate through all possible functions f:[n]->[n]
    for f in product(range(n), repeat=n):
        seen = set()
        for x in range(n):
            y = x
            # Compute f^exponent(x)
            for _ in range(exponent):
                y = f[y]
            seen.add(y)
        total += len(seen)
    return total

def main():
    # Test small cases to find pattern
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
    exponents = [4, 6]  # Using smaller exponents for computation
    sizes = [2, 3, 4]   # Using smaller sizes for computation
    
    for p in primes:
        for n in sizes:
            for e in exponents:
                res = count_distinct_orbit_elements(n, e)
                mod = res % p
                print(f"n={n}, e={e}, p={p}: sum ≡ {mod} mod {p}")
    
    # For the actual problem (n=2021, e=2021, p=2017)
    # We observe patterns from smaller cases to conjecture the answer
    # The actual computation would be too large, so we stop here
    print("For n=2021, e=2021, p=2017:")
    print("Based on pattern observation, the answer is likely:")
    print("(2021 * (2021^2020)) mod 2017 = ...")
    # Don't print the actual conjectured answer as per requirements
