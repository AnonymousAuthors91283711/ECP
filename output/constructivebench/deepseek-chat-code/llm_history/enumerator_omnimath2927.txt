[write_program]
This problem is a simple arithmetic expression evaluation. We need to compute the exact value of the expression 4 + 3/10 + 9/1000. The Python program should calculate and print this exact value as a fraction to maintain precision.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_expression():
    # Compute each term as fractions to maintain exact precision
    term1 = Fraction(4, 1)
    term2 = Fraction(3, 10)
    term3 = Fraction(9, 1000)
    result = term1 + term2 + term3
    print(result)

compute_expression()
```
