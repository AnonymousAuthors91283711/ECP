[write_program]
This problem asks to find the integer value of √(105³ - 104³) that makes the equation true. We'll write a Python program to compute this value exactly by evaluating the expression and checking if it's a perfect square.

The approach is:
1. Compute 105³ - 104³
2. Take the square root of the result
3. Check if it's an integer
4. Print the result if it is

```python
import math

def main():
    n = 105
    m = 104
    value = n**3 - m**3
    root = math.isqrt(value)
    if root * root == value:
        print(root)
    else:
        print("No perfect square found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
