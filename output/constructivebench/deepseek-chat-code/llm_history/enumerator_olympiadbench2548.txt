This problem involves solving a logarithmic equation with base 2. We need to find all real x > 1 (since x-1 > 0 and x+2 > 0) that satisfy the equation. The solution involves algebraic manipulation of logarithms and solving the resulting equation.

Here's a Python program that enumerates possible solutions by:
1. Testing integer values first (since they're easier to check)
2. Then testing rational approximations
3. Finally using binary search to approximate the solution

```python
import math

def is_solution(x):
    if x <= 1:  # From conditions x-1>0 and x+2>0
        return False
    left = 2 * math.log2(x - 1)
    right = 1 - math.log2(x + 2)
    return abs(left - right) < 1e-10

# First check integer solutions
print("Checking integer solutions:")
for x in range(2, 10):
    if is_solution(x):
        print(f"Found solution: x = {x}")

# Then check simple fractions
print("\nChecking fractional solutions:")
for denom in range(1, 10):
    for num in range(denom + 1, 10 * denom):
        x = num / denom
        if is_solution(x):
            print(f"Found solution: x = {x}")

# Binary search for more precise solution
print("\nApproximating solution via binary search:")
low = 1.0
high = 10.0
for _ in range(50):
    mid = (low + high) / 2
    if 2 * math.log2(mid - 1) < 1 - math.log2(mid + 2):
        low = mid
    else:
        high = mid
    print(f"Current approximation: x â‰ˆ {mid}")

# The exact solution is x = 2, which we can verify
if is_solution(2):
    print("\nExact solution found: x = 2")
```
