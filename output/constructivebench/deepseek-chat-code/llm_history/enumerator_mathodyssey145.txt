[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest cardinality of a finite set of natural numbers S where there exists an element k in S such that k divides the product of all other elements in S. We'll write a Python program to enumerate small sets and check this condition.

The approach:
1. Iterate over possible set sizes starting from 2 (since single-element sets trivially satisfy the condition)
2. For each size, generate all combinations of distinct natural numbers
3. Check if any element in the set divides the product of the others
4. Stop when we find the smallest size where such a set exists

```python
import itertools
import math

def find_min_set_size(max_size=10):
    for size in range(2, max_size + 1):
        # Try numbers starting from 2 up to a reasonable limit
        for nums in itertools.combinations(range(2, size + 2), size):
            product = math.prod(nums)
            for k in nums:
                # Check if k divides product/k (which is product of others)
                if (product // k) % k == 0:
                    print(f"Found set of size {size}: {nums} with divisor {k}")
                    return size
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    min_size = find_min_set_size()
    if min_size is not None:
        print(f"Minimum set size is: {min_size}")
    else:
        print("No set found within the search range")
```
