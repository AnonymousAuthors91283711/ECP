theorem olympiadbench3084 :
  ∃ (f : ℤ → ℕ), (∀ (n : ℤ), f n = f (n - 1) * f (n - 2)) ∧
  (∀ (n : ℤ), 0 < n → 0 < f n) ∧
  f 1 = f 2 / 512 ∧ (1 / f 1 : ℚ) = 2 * f 2 ∧
  f (f 4) = olympiadbench3084_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: f(3) = 0.5
f(4) = 8.0
f(5) = 4.0
f(6) = 32.0
f(7) = 128.0
f(8) = 4096.0
Final answer: f(f(4)) = f(8) = 4096.0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<4096>>>
