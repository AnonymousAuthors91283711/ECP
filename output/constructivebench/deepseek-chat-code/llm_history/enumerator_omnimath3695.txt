[write_program]
This problem asks to find all triples of prime numbers (p, q, r) that satisfy the equation 3*p^4 - 5*q^4 - 4*r^2 = 26. We'll write a Python program to search for such triples within reasonable bounds.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible prime values for p, q, r up to a reasonable limit (since higher primes will make the left side too large)
2. For each combination, check if it satisfies the equation
3. Output valid triples as they're found

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]:
        if n % p == 0:
            return n == p
    d = n - 1
    s = 0
    while d % 2 == 0:
        d //= 2
        s += 1
    for a in [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]:
        if a >= n:
            continue
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(s - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False
    return True

        continue
    for q in range(2, max_limit):

            continue
        p4 = p**4
        q4 = q**4
        # Calculate r^2 = (3*p^4 - 5*q^4 - 26)/4
        numerator = 3*p4 - 5*q4 - 26
        if numerator <= 0 or numerator % 4 != 0:
            continue
        r_squared = numerator // 4
        if r_squared <= 0:
            continue
        r = int(math.isqrt(r_squared))
        if r*r != r_squared:
            continue
        if is_prime(r):
            print(f"Found solution: p={p}, q={q}, r={r}")
            found = True

if not found:
    print("No solutions found in the search range")
