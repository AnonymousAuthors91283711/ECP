This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that 13 divides n^3 + n^2 + n + 1. We can factor the polynomial as (n^2 + 1)(n + 1), so we need 13 to divide either (n^2 + 1) or (n + 1). We'll enumerate n from 1 upwards until we find the smallest solution.

```python
def find_min_n():
    # We'll check n from 1 upwards until we find one satisfying 13 divides n^3 + n^2 + n + 1
    for n in range(1, 100):  # 100 is a safe upper bound since 13 is small
        if (n**3 + n**2 + n + 1) % 13 == 0:
            print(f"Found candidate: {n}")
            return n  # Return the first (smallest) solution found
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    min_n = find_min_n()
    if min_n is not None:
        print(f"The smallest positive integer is: {min_n}")
    else:
        print("No solution found in the search range")
```
