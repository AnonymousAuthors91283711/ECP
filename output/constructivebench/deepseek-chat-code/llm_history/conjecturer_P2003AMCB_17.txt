noncomputable abbrev P2003AMCB_17_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2003AMCB_17 (x y : ℝ) (hx : x > 0) (hy : y > 0)
  (h1 : log (x * y^3) = 1) (h2 : log (x^2 * y) = 1) :
  log (x * y) = P2003AMCB_17_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found solution: x = 1.4918246976412701, y = 1.2214027581601699
Verification: log(xy^3) = 1.0, log(x^2y) = 0.9999999999999998
Final answer: log(xy) = 0.5999999999999999. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
