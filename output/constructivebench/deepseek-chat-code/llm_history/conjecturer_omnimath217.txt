Note: Examine which property matches the theorem pattern. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × Bool → Prop
From the enumerated answers, we can see the pattern matches when:
- For n=0, the boolean is false
- For positive n, the boolean is true when n is prime, even, power of two, or factorial
The most general condition covering all cases seems to be when n is a natural number (n ≥ 0).
