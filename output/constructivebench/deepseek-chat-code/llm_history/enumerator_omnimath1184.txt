[write_program]
The problem asks for the maximum probability that the product of two randomly chosen integers from 1 to N is divisible by 10. We'll write a Python program to enumerate this probability for small values of N to help conjecture the answer.

The approach:
1. For each N from 1 upwards, compute the probability that x*y ≡ 0 mod 10 where x,y ∈ [1,N]
2. Count pairs (x,y) where x*y is divisible by 10
3. Divide by N² to get the probability
4. Track the maximum probability seen so far

We'll stop when N reaches 100 since the pattern stabilizes quickly.

```python
def compute_max_probability():
    max_prob = 0.0
    best_N = 0
    
    for N in range(1, 101):
        count = 0
        for x in range(1, N+1):
            for y in range(1, N+1):
                if (x * y) % 10 == 0:
                    count += 1
        prob = count / (N * N)
        
        # Print current N and probability
        print(f"N={N}: probability={prob}")
        
        # Update maximum
        if prob > max_prob:
            max_prob = prob
            best_N = N
    
    # Output the maximum found
    print(f"\nMaximum probability: {max_prob} (achieved at N={best_N})")

compute_max_probability()
