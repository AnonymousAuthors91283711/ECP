This problem involves solving a simple linear equation. The equation is x/90 - x/120 = 16/60, and we need to find the value of x that satisfies it. The solution can be found by combining the fractions on the left side and solving for x.

Here's a Python program that calculates the exact solution (as a fraction) and its decimal approximation:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Solve x/90 - x/120 = 16/60
# Find common denominator for left side: 360
# (4x - 3x)/360 = 16/60
# x/360 = 16/60
# x = 360 * 16 / 60
numerator = 360 * 16
denominator = 60
x = Fraction(numerator, denominator)

# Simplify the fraction
x_simplified = x.numerator // math.gcd(x.numerator, x.denominator)
y_simplified = x.denominator // math.gcd(x.numerator, x.denominator)

print(f"Exact solution as fraction: {x_simplified}/{y_simplified}")
print(f"Decimal approximation: {float(x)}")
```

The program first calculates the exact solution by representing all numbers as fractions to avoid floating-point inaccuracies. It then simplifies the resulting fraction and prints both the exact fractional form and its decimal approximation. The solution follows directly from combining the fractions on the left side and solving for x.

Judgement:
The original program has several issues:
1. It doesn't import the `math` module needed for `math.gcd`
2. It attempts to print simplified fraction components separately but doesn't properly output the final simplified fraction
3. The output format doesn't match the problem requirements (should print the answer immediately when found)
4. The program doesn't actually solve for x in the required format (should show the exact value first)

The problem is a simple linear equation, so we should:
1. Compute the exact solution using fractions
2. Output it immediately in simplest form
3. Optionally show decimal approximation
4. Remove unnecessary simplification steps since Fraction already handles this

<<<False>>>

Here's the corrected program:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Solve x/90 - x/120 = 16/60
# Common denominator for left side is 360: (4x - 3x)/360 = 16/60
# Simplifies to x/360 = 16/60
# Solution: x = 360 * 16 / 60
x = Fraction(360 * 16, 60)

# Output exact solution (Fraction automatically simplifies)
print(x)
```
