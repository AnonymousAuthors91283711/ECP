Ground Truth Answer: fun ⟨x, y⟩ => 15 - y / x
Proposed Answer: fun (x, y) => y - x + (x^2)/y
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function z = f(x,y) where x ∈ [2,5] and y ∈ [10,20], and claims the maximum value of z is 13.

2. Ground Truth Answer: z = 15 - y/x
   - To find maximum, we minimize y/x
   - y/x is minimized when x is max (5) and y is min (10)
   - So min y/x = 10/5 = 2
   - Thus max z = 15 - 2 = 13 (matches the theorem)

3. Proposed Answer: z = y - x + x²/y
   - Let's test at x=5, y=10 (where ground truth gets max):
     z = 10 - 5 + 25/10 = 5 + 2.5 = 7.5 ≠ 13
   - Checking other boundary points:
     x=2, y=10: z = 10-2+4/10 = 8.4
     x=5, y=20: z = 20-5+25/20 = 16.25
     x=2, y=20: z = 20-2+4/20 = 18.2

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth and doesn't satisfy the condition that the maximum is 13.
