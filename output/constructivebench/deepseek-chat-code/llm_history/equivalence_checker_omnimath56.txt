Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1, 1, 3)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1, 1, 3), (1, 2, 2, 5)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all quadruples (a,b,c,p) where:
   - a,b,c are positive integers
   - p is prime
   - 2^a * p^b = (p + 2)^c + 1

2. Ground truth gives only (1,1,1,3):
   - 2^1 * 3^1 = 6
   - (3+2)^1 + 1 = 6
   - This is correct

3. Proposed answer adds (1,2,2,5):
   - 2^1 * 5^2 = 50
   - (5+2)^2 + 1 = 49 + 1 = 50
   - This also satisfies the equation

4. Checking if there are other solutions:
   - For p=2: (2+2)^c + 1 must be divisible by 2^a * 2^b, but 4^c + 1 is odd, so no solutions
   - For p=7: 2^a * 7^b = 9^c + 1. Testing small values shows no solutions
   - Higher primes seem unlikely to yield solutions with small exponents

The proposed answer correctly identifies both valid solutions that satisfy the equation. The ground truth answer is incomplete as it misses the (1,2,2,5) case.
