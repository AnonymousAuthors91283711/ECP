Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (-1)^(ceil (n / 2 : ℚ) - 1) * 2 * ceil (n / 2 : ℚ)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if Even n then -n else n
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the determinant of a special matrix where each entry counts solutions to a Diophantine equation.

2. The ground truth answer involves:
   - A sign factor (-1)^(ceil(n/2)-1)
   - Multiplied by 2*ceil(n/2)

3. The proposed answer is simpler:
   - If n is even: returns -n
   - If n is odd: returns n

Let's compare them for several values:
- n=1 (odd):
  Ground truth: (-1)^0 * 2*1 = 2
  Proposed: 1
  Different

- n=2 (even):
  Ground truth: (-1)^(1-1)*2*1 = 2
  Proposed: -2
  Different

- n=3 (odd):
  Ground truth: (-1)^(2-1)*2*2 = -4
  Proposed: 3
  Different

- n=4 (even):
  Ground truth: (-1)^(2-1)*2*2 = -4
  Proposed: -4
  Same

The answers only match at n=4 but differ elsewhere. The patterns are completely different.
