[write_program]
This problem involves finding all integer-coefficient polynomials P such that for every bijective integer sequence a, there exists indices i<j and an integer k where the sum of a from i to j equals P evaluated at k. We'll write a Python program to enumerate candidate polynomials of low degree and small coefficients, checking if they satisfy the condition for small bijective sequences.

The approach is:
1. Generate small integer-coefficient polynomials
2. For each polynomial, test against small bijective sequences
3. Output polynomials that pass all tests

```python
import itertools

def generate_bijective_sequences(length):
    """Generate all bijective sequences of given length using integers 1..length"""
    for perm in itertools.permutations(range(1, length+1)):
        yield list(perm)

def test_polynomial(P, max_seq_length=5):
    """Test if polynomial P satisfies the condition for all bijective sequences up to max_seq_length"""
    for n in range(2, max_seq_length+1):
        for seq in generate_bijective_sequences(n):
            found = False
            # Check all possible i<j pairs and k values
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(i+1, n):
                    s = sum(seq[i:j+1])
                    # Check if s is in P's range for small k
                    for k in range(-5, 6):
                        if P(k) == s:
                            found = True
                            break
                    if found: break
                if found: break
            if not found:
                return False
    return True

def generate_polynomials(max_degree=2, max_coeff=2):
    """Generate polynomials with given max degree and coefficients"""
    for degree in range(max_degree+1):
        for coeffs in itertools.product(range(-max_coeff, max_coeff+1), repeat=degree+1):
            if coeffs[-1] == 0 and degree > 0:  # Skip if leading coefficient is 0
                continue
            yield lambda x, c=coeffs: sum(c[i]*(x**i) for i in range(len(c)))

def main():
    print("Searching for candidate polynomials...")
    for P in generate_polynomials():
        if test_polynomial(P):
            # Print coefficients from highest degree to constant term
            coeffs = []
            try:
                # Try to extract coefficients by evaluating at 0 and differences
                c0 = P(0)
                c1 = P(1) - c0
                coeffs = [c1, c0]  # Assuming linear for demo
                print(f"Found candidate polynomial with coefficients: {coeffs}")
            except:
                print("Found candidate polynomial (coefficients not extracted)")
