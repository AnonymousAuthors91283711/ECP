theorem omnimath52 (a n : ℕ) (ha : a > 0) (hn : n > 0) :
  n ∣ ((a + 1)^n - a^n) ↔ (a, n) ∈ omnimath52_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: { (a, n) | n = 1 ∧ a > 0 }
Proposed Answer: {p : ℕ × ℕ | p.2 = 1}
Let's analyze this problem carefully:

1. The problem asks when n divides (a+1)^n - a^n for positive integers a and n.

2. The ground truth answer states this only happens when n=1 (for any a>0). This is correct because:
   - For n=1: (a+1)^1 - a^1 = 1, which is divisible by 1
   - For n>1: The expression (a+1)^n - a^n expands to n*a^(n-1) + ... + 1, which generally won't be divisible by n unless specific conditions are met (which aren't satisfied for arbitrary a)

3. The proposed answer is {p : ℕ × ℕ | p.2 = 1}, which means all pairs where the second element (n) is 1. This is equivalent to the ground truth except it doesn't explicitly state a>0.

4. However, in the theorem statement, we already have ha : a > 0 as a precondition, so the proposed answer is actually equivalent in context.
