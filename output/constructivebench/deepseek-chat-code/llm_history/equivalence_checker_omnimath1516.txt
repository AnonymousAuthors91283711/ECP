Ground Truth Answer: 23/30
Proposed Answer: (2 * 15 + 1) / (3 * 15)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive probability function p(n) where:
   - p(0) = p(1) = 1
   - For n+1, it's a combination of staying (with probability 1-1/(2(n+1)²)) and switching (with probability 1/(2(n+1)²))

2. The ground truth answer is given as 23/30 ≈ 0.7666...

3. The proposed answer simplifies to (2*15+1)/(3*15) = 31/45 ≈ 0.6888...

4. These are clearly different values (23/30 ≠ 31/45), and the proposed answer doesn't match the recursive definition given in the problem.
