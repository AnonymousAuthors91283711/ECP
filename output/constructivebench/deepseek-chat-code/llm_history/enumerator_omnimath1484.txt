This problem involves finding the number of functions f from natural numbers to ZMod 17 that satisfy two conditions:
1. Periodicity: f(x+17) = f(x) for all x ≥ 1
2. Functional equation: f(x²) = (f(x))² + 15 for all x ≥ 1

Since the function is periodic with period 17, we only need to consider its values on {1,...,17}. We'll enumerate all possible functions on this domain that satisfy the functional equation.

```python
from itertools import product

def solve():
    p = 17
    constant = 15
    # We'll represent ZMod p values as integers 0..p-1
    # The function is determined by its values on 1..p
    
    # Precompute all squares mod p (since x^2 mod p determines x mod p)
    square_to_roots = [[] for _ in range(p)]
    for x in range(p):
        square = (x*x) % p
        square_to_roots[square].append(x)
    
    count = 0
    
    # Try all possible values for f(0) (though problem says x ≥ 1)
    # But since function is periodic, f(0) = f(17)
    # So we'll include it in our enumeration
    
    # We need to assign values to all residues mod p
    # But the functional equation creates dependencies
    
    # First find all multiplicative constraints
    # For each x, f(x^2 mod p) = (f(x))^2 + 15 mod p
    
    # We'll build the function step by step, tracking dependencies
    # We'll represent known values in a dictionary
    # And keep track of which values are fixed
    
    # We need to find all possible assignments to a set of generators
    # of the multiplicative semigroup mod p
    
    # The multiplicative semigroup mod 17 is generated by 3 (a primitive root)
    # So we can assign f(3) freely, and other values are determined
    
    # But we need to be careful about squares and their roots
    
    # Alternative approach: find all possible values for f on quadratic residues,
    # then see how they constrain non-residues
    
    # There are 8 quadratic residues mod 17 (excluding 0)
    residues = { (x*x)%p for x in range(1,p) }
    non_residues = set(range(1,p)) - residues
    
    # For each residue r, f(r) must satisfy f(r) = y^2 + 15 for some y with y^2 ≡ r
    # So f(r) must be in { (y^2 + 15) mod p | y^2 ≡ r }
    
    # For non-residues n, f(n) can be arbitrary, but f(n^2) is constrained
    
    # Let's count possible functions
    
    # First count possible assignments to residues
    residue_options = 1
    for r in residues:
        # Find all y with y^2 ≡ r
        ys = [x for x in range(p) if (x*x)%p == r]
        options = set()
        for y in ys:
            val = (y*y + constant) % p
            options.add(val)
        residue_options *= len(options)
    
    # For non-residues, each can be chosen freely
    non_residue_count = len(non_residues)
    non_residue_options = p ** non_residue_count
    
    total = residue_options * non_residue_options
    
    # But we need to consider that f(0) is also part of the function
    # The problem says x ≥ 1, but the periodicity condition includes x=0 via f(17)=f(0)
    # The functional equation doesn't constrain f(0) directly
    
    # So f(0) can be chosen freely
    total *= p
    
    print(f"Total number of valid functions: {total}")
