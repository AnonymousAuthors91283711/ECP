This problem involves counting certain functions from Fin 5 to Sym2(Fin 5) with specific constraints. We'll enumerate valid configurations by:
1. Representing Sym2(Fin 5) as unordered pairs
2. Ensuring no function maps to its diagonal
3. Checking each unordered pair appears exactly twice
4. Ensuring no two distinct inputs map to same output

We'll use itertools to generate combinations and check constraints.

```python
import itertools

def solve():
    n = 5
    elements = list(range(n))
    # Generate all unordered pairs (Sym2(Fin 5))
    sym2 = list(itertools.combinations(elements, 2))
    # Add diagonal elements (i,i) which are excluded by first condition
    diagonal = [(i,i) for i in elements]
    
    count = 0
    
    # We need to assign each of 5 inputs to a non-diagonal pair
    # Each pair must appear exactly twice, and no two inputs share same pair
    # Since there are C(5,2)=10 pairs and we use 5 inputs with each pair appearing twice,
    # we must have exactly 2.5 pairs used, which is impossible. Hence answer is 0.
    
    # But let's verify by enumeration for small cases
    for n in range(1, 6):
        elements = list(range(n))
        sym2 = list(itertools.combinations(elements, 2))
        diagonal = [(i,i) for i in elements]
        
        valid = 0
        # Try all possible assignments
        for assignment in itertools.product(sym2, repeat=n):
            valid_assignment = True
            # Check no diagonal
            for i in range(n):
                if assignment[i] == (i,i):
                    valid_assignment = False
                    break
            if not valid_assignment:
                continue
            
            # Check each pair appears exactly twice
            pair_counts = {}
            for pair in assignment:
                pair_counts[pair] = pair_counts.get(pair, 0) + 1
            if not all(v == 2 for v in pair_counts.values()):
                continue
            
            # Check no two distinct inputs have same output
            if len(set(assignment)) != len(assignment):
                continue
            
            valid += 1
        
        print(f"For n={n}, count={valid}")

solve()
```
