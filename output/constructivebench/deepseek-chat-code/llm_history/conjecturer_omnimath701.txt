theorem omnimath701 :
  let outcomes := {1, 2, 3}
  let jerry_prob (j : ℕ) := if j ∈ outcomes then (1 : ℚ)/3 else 0
  let neil_prob (j : ℕ) (n : ℕ) := 
    if n ∈ outcomes ∧ n ≥ j then (1 : ℚ)/3 * ((2 : ℚ)/3)^(n - j) else 0
  (∑ j in outcomes, jerry_prob j * (∑ n in outcomes, if n = 3 then neil_prob j n else 0)) = omnimath701_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: j=1, n=3: probability 4/81
j=2, n=3: probability 2/27
j=3, n=3: probability 1/9
Total probability: 19/81. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<19/81>>>
