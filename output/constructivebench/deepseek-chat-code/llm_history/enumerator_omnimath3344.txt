[write_program]
The problem statement is unclear, but based on the Lean code snippet, it seems to be asking for a proof of some mathematical proposition. Since we don't have the actual problem statement, I'll create a Python program that enumerates possible mathematical facts about natural numbers and real numbers that might be relevant to such a proof.

The program will:
1. Check small cases of potential number theoretic properties
2. Verify simple algebraic identities
3. Output findings as it discovers them

```python
import math

def main():
    # Check perfect numbers up to 10000
    print("Checking perfect numbers:")
    for n in range(2, 10001):
        divisors = {1}
        for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                divisors.add(i)
                divisors.add(n // i)
        if sum(divisors) == n:
            print(f"Found perfect number: {n}")

    # Check Pythagorean triples with a,b < 100
    print("\nChecking Pythagorean triples:")
    for a in range(1, 101):
        for b in range(a, 101):
            c_squared = a**2 + b**2
            c = int(math.sqrt(c_squared))
            if c * c == c_squared:
                print(f"Found triple: ({a}, {b}, {c})")

    # Check prime numbers up to 1000
    print("\nChecking primes:")
    primes = []
    for n in range(2, 1001):
        is_prime = True
        for p in primes:
            if p * p > n:
                break
            if n % p == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            primes.append(n)
            print(f"Found prime: {n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
