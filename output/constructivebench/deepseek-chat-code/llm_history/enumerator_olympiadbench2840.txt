This problem involves solving for x in a logarithmic equation with factorials. We'll write a Python program to compute the exact value of x given the parameters. The key is to simplify the logarithmic expressions and solve for x.

```python
import math

def compute_x():
    # Given parameters
    T = -10
    fact_8 = math.factorial(8)
    fact_6 = math.factorial(6)
    
    # Simplify the logarithmic terms
    # log2(4^(8!)) = log2((2^2)^(8!)) = 2 * 8!
    term1 = 2 * fact_8
    
    # log4(2^(8!)) = log4((4^(1/2))^(8!)) = (8!)/2
    term2 = fact_8 / 2
    
    left_side = term1 + term2
    
    # Solve for x: left_side = 6! * T * x
    denominator = fact_6 * T
    x = left_side / denominator
    
    # Print exact fractional form (simplified)
    numerator = 5 * fact_8
    denominator = 2 * fact_6 * T
    print(f"x = {numerator}/{denominator} = {x}")

compute_x()
```
