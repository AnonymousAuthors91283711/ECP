Ground Truth Answer: 89
Proposed Answer: 2 * 3 ^ (1 / 3) + 3 ^ (4 / 3) + 2 * 3 ^ (2 / 3)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives two equations involving x and y, and asks to evaluate the expression 2x³ + (xy)³ + 2y³.

2. The ground truth answer is simply 89 (a constant).

3. The proposed answer is a complex expression involving cube roots of 3.

To check equivalence:
- First, let's numerically evaluate the proposed expression:
  2 * 3^(1/3) ≈ 2 * 1.442 ≈ 2.884
  3^(4/3) = 3 * 3^(1/3) ≈ 4.327
  2 * 3^(2/3) ≈ 2 * 2.080 ≈ 4.160
  Sum ≈ 2.884 + 4.327 + 4.160 ≈ 11.371

- This is clearly not equal to 89 (11.371 ≠ 89).

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth numerically, and the form is completely different (a sum of roots vs a simple integer).
