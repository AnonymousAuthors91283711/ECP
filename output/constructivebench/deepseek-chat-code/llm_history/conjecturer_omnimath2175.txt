  s.sum id = omnimath2175_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 
Testing with 3 iterations:
Found candidate: 8
Found candidate: 9
Sum for 3 iterations: 17

Testing with 4 iterations:
Found candidate: 10
Sum for 4 iterations: 10

Testing with 5 iterations:
Found candidate: 12
Sum for 5 iterations: 12. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the enumerated answers and the pattern observed (8,9 for 3 iterations summing to 17; 10 for 4 iterations; 12 for 5 iterations), the answer appears to follow the formula 2k+2 where k is the number of iterations (2022 in the original problem).
