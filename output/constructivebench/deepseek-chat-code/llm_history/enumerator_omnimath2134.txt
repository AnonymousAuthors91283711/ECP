[write_program]
The problem asks to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(4^8 - 1\) and \(8^{12} - 1\). To solve this, we can use the property that \(\gcd(a^n - 1, a^m - 1) = a^{\gcd(n, m)} - 1\) when \(a\) is an integer. However, here the bases are different (4 and 8), but we can rewrite them in terms of powers of 2 since \(4 = 2^2\) and \(8 = 2^3\). 

The program will compute the GCD directly using Python's built-in `math.gcd` function after calculating the two large numbers. Since the numbers are large but still manageable for Python's arbitrary-precision integers, we can compute them directly.

```python
import math

# Compute the two numbers
a = 4**8 - 1
b = 8**12 - 1

# Compute and print the GCD
gcd = math.gcd(a, b)
print(gcd)
```
