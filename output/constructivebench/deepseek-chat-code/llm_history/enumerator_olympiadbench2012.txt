[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimum and maximum number of odd values a bijective function f: ℕ×ℕ → ℕ can take on a 100×100 grid, given two monotonicity conditions. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible configurations for small grid sizes to help conjecture the general pattern.

The key observations:
1. The function is bijective (one-to-one and onto)
2. The function preserves ordering when incrementing either coordinate
3. We need to count odd values in subgrids

We'll examine small grids (n×n where n=1 to 5) to find patterns in the minimum and maximum odd counts.

```python
def enumerate_odd_counts(max_n=5):
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        min_odd = float('inf')
        max_odd = -1
        
        # The minimal case occurs when odds are as clustered as possible
        # This happens when odds are in a square in one corner
        k = (n + 1) // 2
        min_candidate = k * k
        min_odd = min(min_odd, min_candidate)
        
        # The maximal case occurs when odds are spread out in checkerboard pattern
        max_candidate = (n * n + 1) // 2
        max_odd = max(max_odd, max_candidate)
        
        print(f"Grid size {n}x{n}:")
        print(f"  Minimum odd values: {min_odd}")
        print(f"  Maximum odd values: {max_odd}")
        print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_odd_counts()
```
