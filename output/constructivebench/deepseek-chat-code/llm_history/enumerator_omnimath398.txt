[write_program]
This problem asks for the sum of cubes from 1 to 2001. We'll write a Python program to compute this sum exactly. The formula for the sum of cubes from 1 to n is known to be (n(n+1)/2)^2, so we'll implement this formula directly for verification.

```python
def sum_of_cubes(n):
    """Compute the sum of cubes from 1 to n using the closed-form formula."""
    return (n * (n + 1) // 2) ** 2

# Compute for n = 2001
n = 2001
result = sum_of_cubes(n)
print(f"Sum of cubes from 1 to {n}: {result}")
```
