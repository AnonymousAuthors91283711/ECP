[write_program]
This problem asks for the sum of all divisors d between 10 and 99 (inclusive) of 2³²-1. We'll write a Python program to find all such divisors and compute their sum.

The approach:
1. Compute 2³²-1 = 4294967295
2. Check all integers d from 10 to 99
3. For each d, check if 4294967295 % d == 0
4. Sum all valid divisors

```python
def main():
    n = 2**32 - 1  # 4294967295
    total = 0
    valid_divisors = []
    
    for d in range(10, 100):
        if n % d == 0:
            valid_divisors.append(d)
            total += d
            print(f"Found divisor: {d}")  # Stream partial results
    
    print(f"Sum of all valid divisors: {total}")
    print(f"All valid divisors: {valid_divisors}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
