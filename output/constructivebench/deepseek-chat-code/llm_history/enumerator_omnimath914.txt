[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of integers `a` between 2 and 101 (inclusive) such that the sequence `a^(2^n) mod 100` becomes constant for sufficiently large `n`. We need to count how many such `a` exist in this range.

The key insight is that the sequence stabilizes when the exponent reaches the maximum needed for the Carmichael function λ(100) = 20 (since 100 = 4×25 and λ(4)=2, λ(25)=20, LCM is 20). The sequence stabilizes when 2^N is divisible by λ(100)/gcd(λ(100),ord(a,100)).

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Check for each a in 2..101 if a^2^n mod 100 stabilizes
2. Count how many such a exist

```python
def compute_carmichael(n):
    # Carmichael function λ(n)
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a
    def lcm(a, b):
        return a * b // gcd(a, b)
    
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    result = 1
    # Handle 2
    if n % 2 == 0:
        result = 1
        n = n // 2
        while n % 2 == 0:
            result *= 2
            n = n // 2
        result = 2 if result >= 2 else 1
    # Handle odd primes
    p = 3
    while p * p <= n:
        if n % p == 0:
            exponent = 1
            n = n // p
            while n % p == 0:
                exponent += 1
                n = n // p
            result = lcm(result, (p - 1) * (p ** (exponent - 1)))
        p += 2
    if n > 1:
        result = lcm(result, n - 1)
    return result

def count_stabilizing_a():
    count = 0
    carmichael_100 = 20  # λ(100) = LCM(λ(4),λ(25)) = LCM(2,20) = 20
    
    for a in range(2, 102):
        # Check if a and 100 are not coprime
        if pow(a, 1, 2) == 0 or pow(a, 1, 5) == 0:
            # For non-coprime a, check if a^2^N ≡ 0 mod 100 for some N
            # We need a^2^N divisible by 100
            # The minimal N is when 2^N ≥ max(exponent of 2 and 5 in a's factorization)
            found = False
            current = a
            for N in range(1, 10):  # 2^10 is more than enough
                current = (current * current) % 100
                if current == 0:
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                count += 1
        else:
            # For coprime a, the sequence stabilizes when 2^N is divisible by λ(100)/gcd(λ(100),ord(a,100))
            # Since λ(100)=20, and ord(a,100) divides 20, it will stabilize
            count += 1
    
    print(count)
