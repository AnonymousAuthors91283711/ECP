Ground Truth Answer: 5/4
Proposed Answer: 1 / (1 / 2 * 1 / 2 * 2) / (2 * 2 * (1 / 2))
Let's analyze the proposed answer step by step:

1. The ground truth answer is 5/4 = 1.25
2. The proposed answer is: 1 / (1 / 2 * 1 / 2 * 2) / (2 * 2 * (1 / 2))
   - Let's compute the denominator first: (1/2 * 1/2 * 2) = (1/4 * 2) = 1/2
   - Then the numerator: (2 * 2 * (1/2)) = (4 * 1/2) = 2
   - So the expression becomes: (1 / (1/2)) / 2 = (2) / 2 = 1

The proposed answer evaluates to 1, while the ground truth is 1.25. They are not equal.
