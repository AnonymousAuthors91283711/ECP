theorem P2000AIMEI_10 :
  ∃! (x : Fin 100 → ℚ),
    (∀ k : Fin 100, x k = (∑ i, x i) - x k - k.val) ∧
    x ⟨49, by simp⟩ = P2000AIMEI_10_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: For n=5, solution is:
x_0 = 5.0
x_1 = 4.5
x_2 = 4.0
x_3 = 3.5
x_4 = 3.0

For n=100, x_49 = 2450.5. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<(2451 : ℚ) - (1/2 : ℚ)>>>
