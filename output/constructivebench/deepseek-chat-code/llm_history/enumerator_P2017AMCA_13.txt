This problem involves finding a unique distance `d` given two travel scenarios with different speeds. The first equation gives the time for the full distance at speed `v`, while the second equation gives the time for partial distances with a speed reduction. We'll enumerate possible integer values of `d` and check the conditions.

```python
import math

def solve():
    # We'll search for d in reasonable integer range (100-1000 miles)
    for d in range(100, 1001):
        # From first equation: 180/60 = d/v => v = d/3
        v = d / 3
        
        # Check second equation: 276/60 = (d/3)/v + (2d/3)/(v-20)
        lhs = 276 / 60
        term1 = (d/3) / v
        term2 = (2*d/3) / (v - 20)
        rhs = term1 + term2
        
        # Check if equation holds with reasonable tolerance
        if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-6:
            print(f"Found candidate: d = {d}, v = {v}")
            # Verify all conditions
            if v > 20 and d > 0:
                print(f"Valid solution found: d = {d}")
                return
    
    print("No solution found in range")

solve()
```
