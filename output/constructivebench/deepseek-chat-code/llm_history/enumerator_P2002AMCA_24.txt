[write_program]
This problem involves finding the number of real pairs (a,b) that satisfy the complex equation (a + ib)^2002 = a - ib. We'll write a Python program to enumerate solutions for smaller exponents to identify a pattern.

The key observation is that for (a + ib)^n = a - ib, we can consider polar form and magnitude conditions. For non-zero solutions, the magnitude condition requires |a + ib| = 0 or 1. We'll enumerate possible cases.

```python
import cmath
import math

def find_solutions(max_n=10):
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        solutions = set()
        # Case 1: a + ib = 0
        solutions.add((0.0, 0.0))
        
        # Case 2: |a + ib| = 1
        # We need to find θ such that e^(i nθ) = e^(-iθ)
        # So nθ ≡ -θ mod 2π => θ = 2πk/(n+1) for k=0..n
        for k in range(n + 1):
            theta = 2 * math.pi * k / (n + 1)
            a = math.cos(theta)
            b = math.sin(theta)
            # Verify the solution
            lhs = (a + 1j * b) ** n
            rhs = a - 1j * b
            if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-10:  # Account for floating point errors
                solutions.add((round(a, 10), round(b, 10)))
        
        print(f"For n={n}, found {len(solutions)} solutions: {sorted(solutions)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solutions(10)
```
