The problem involves computing the value of the function `nabla(a, b) = a^b * b^a` for specific inputs `a=2` and `b=3`. The task is to enumerate and compute this value efficiently in Python.

```python
def nabla(a, b):
    return (a ** b) * (b ** a)

# Compute nabla(2, 3)
a, b = 2, 3
result = nabla(a, b)
print(f"nabla({a}, {b}) = {result}")
```
