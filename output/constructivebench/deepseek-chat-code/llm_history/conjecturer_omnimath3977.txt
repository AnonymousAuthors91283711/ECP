theorem omnimath3977 (m n : ℕ) :
  m^2 + 2 * 3^n = m * (2^(n+1) - 1) ↔ (m, n) ∈ omnimath3977_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for solutions with n up to 20:
Found solution: (m, n) = (9, 3)
Found solution: (m, n) = (6, 3)
Found solution: (m, n) = (54, 5)
Found solution: (m, n) = (9, 5). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
<<<{(9, 3), (6, 3), (54, 5), (9, 5)} ∪ {(3^(k+1), 2*k+1) | k : ℕ} ∪ {(2*3^k, 2*k+1) | k : ℕ}>>>
