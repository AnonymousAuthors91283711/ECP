<<<False>>> 

Explanation: The equation requires both square roots to be rational (since their sum is rational). However, for integer n, sqrt(n-1) and sqrt(n+1) can only both be rational if n-1 and n+1 are perfect squares. The difference between consecutive perfect squares grows as n increases, making it impossible for both n-1 and n+1 to be perfect squares simultaneously for n > 1. The case n=1 yields irrational sqrt(2), confirming no solutions exist.
