The problem asks for the smallest natural number n ≤ 17 such that n*6 + 8*5/2 ≥ 100. We need to find the minimal n satisfying these conditions. The expression simplifies to 6n + 20 ≥ 100 → 6n ≥ 80 → n ≥ 80/6 ≈ 13.333. Since n must be an integer, we look for n ≥ 14.

Here's a Python program that enumerates possible values of n from 14 to 17 (since n ≤ 17) and checks the condition:

```python
def main():
    # Enumerate possible n values from 14 to 17
    for n in range(14, 18):
        if 6 * n + 20 >= 100:
            print(f"n = {n} satisfies the condition")
            # Since we're looking for the smallest n, we can stop after first valid one
            print(f"The minimal solution is {n}")
            return

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
