From analyzing the problem, we're looking for integer values of c where the equation x⁴ - 2c x² + (c+1) = 0 has exactly 12 distinct real roots. The equation is a quartic in x², so we can analyze it as a quadratic in y = x². For there to be 12 real roots, the quadratic must have two distinct positive roots (each giving ± pairs), and each must have multiplicity 3 (since 2 roots × 2 signs × 3 multiplicity = 12). However, enumeration shows no solutions, matching the count of 0.
