[write_program]
This problem involves finding all real values of `a` for which the equation `a*(sin x + sin(2x)) = sin(3x)` has exactly two distinct solutions in the interval (0, π). The problem suggests these values can be characterized by three points p, q, r with p < q < r, where a must be one of these points, and their sum equals some constant.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Numerically find all x in (0, π) that satisfy the equation for various a values
2. Count the number of distinct solutions for each a
3. Identify a values with exactly two solutions
4. Observe patterns in these a values

        y2 = a * (sin(x2) + sin(2*x2)) - sin(3*x2)
        
        if y1 * y2 < 0:  # Sign change indicates root
            # Refine using bisection
            left, right = x1, x2
