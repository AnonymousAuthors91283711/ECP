This problem involves finding the sum of cubes of the roots of a cubic polynomial. We'll write a Python program to compute this sum numerically for verification, then derive the exact algebraic expression.

The key insight is that for a monic cubic polynomial x³ + px² + qx + r with roots a,b,c:
a³ + b³ + c³ = (a+b+c)³ - 3(a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) + 3abc

From the polynomial coefficients:
a+b+c = -p
ab+bc+ca = q
abc = -r

For p(x) = x³ + x² - 333x - 1001:
a+b+c = -1
ab+bc+ca = -333
abc = 1001

Thus:
a³+b³+c³ = (-1)³ - 3(-1)(-333) + 3(1001) = -1 - 999 + 3003 = 2003

Here's the verification program:

```python
def compute_root_sum_cubes():
    # Coefficients of the polynomial x^3 + x^2 - 333x - 1001
    p = 1   # coefficient of x^3
    q = 1   # coefficient of x^2
    r = -333  # coefficient of x
    s = -1001  # constant term
    
    # Using Vieta's formulas
    sum_roots = -q/p
    sum_pairwise = r/p
    product_roots = -s/p
    
    # Formula for sum of cubes of roots
    sum_cubes = (sum_roots**3 - 3*sum_roots*sum_pairwise + 3*product_roots)
    
    print(f"Sum of cubes of roots: {int(sum_cubes)}")

compute_root_sum_cubes()
```
