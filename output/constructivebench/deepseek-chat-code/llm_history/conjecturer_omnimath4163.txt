theorem omnimath4163 :
  (∃ f : ℕ → ℕ, StrictMono f ∧ f 1 = 2 ∧ (∀ n : ℕ, f (f n) = f n + n)) ↔ omnimath4163_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No valid function found in search space. Expected Answer Type: Prop
Based on the problem statement and the fact that no valid function was found in the search space, the most likely answer is that no such function exists. The conditions require a strictly increasing function with specific recursive behavior that appears impossible to satisfy.
