This problem involves finding the value of a polynomial P evaluated at -1, given certain conditions. We'll approach it by:
1. Assuming P is a quadratic polynomial (since the functional equation suggests degree 2)
2. Using the given conditions to set up equations
3. Solving for the coefficients
4. Evaluating at x = -1

Here's a Python program that enumerates possible polynomial coefficients and checks the conditions:

```python
import numpy as np
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, simplify

def solve_problem():
    # Define symbolic variables for polynomial coefficients
    a, b, c = symbols('a b c')
    x = symbols('x')
    
    # Define the polynomial P(x) = ax² + bx + c
    P = a*x**2 + b*x + c
    
    # Condition 1: P(1) = 1
    eq1 = Eq(P.subs(x, 1), 1)
    
    # Condition 2: Functional equation for x ≠ -7
    # We'll pick specific x values to generate equations
    # x=0 gives P(0)/P(1) = 0 → P(0) = 0 → c = 0
    # x=1 gives P(2)/P(2) = 8 - 56/8 = 1 → consistent but no new info
    
    # From c=0, P(x) = ax² + bx
    P = a*x**2 + b*x
    
    # Update eq1 with c=0: a + b = 1
    eq1 = Eq(a + b, 1)
    
    # Choose x=-1 for another equation
    # P(-2)/P(0) = 8 - 56/6 → but P(0)=0, so need different x
    # Choose x=2: P(4)/P(3) = 8 - 56/9 = 16/9
    lhs = P.subs(x, 4)/P.subs(x, 3)
    rhs = 8 - 56/9
    eq2 = Eq(lhs, rhs)
    
    # Solve the system
    solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (a, b))
    
    if solution:
        a_val, b_val = solution[0]
        P_final = a_val*x**2 + b_val*x
        
        # Evaluate at x=-1
        P_minus1 = P_final.subs(x, -1)
        print(f"P(-1) = {P_minus1}")
    else:
        print("No solution found")

solve_problem()
```

The program symbolically solves for the polynomial coefficients that satisfy the given conditions, then evaluates the polynomial at x=-1. The output will show the exact value of P(-1).

Let me analyze the problem and the program:

1. Problem Analysis:
- We need to find a polynomial P(x) satisfying two conditions:
  a) P(1) = 1
  b) A functional equation involving P(2x)/P(x+1) for x ≠ -7
- The goal is to find P(-1)

2. Program Analysis:
- The program attempts to solve for a quadratic polynomial P(x) = ax² + bx + c
- It correctly identifies c=0 from P(0)=0
- It sets up equations using x=1 and x=2
- However, it fails to find a solution because the equations are inconsistent for a quadratic polynomial

3. Issues:
- The functional equation suggests the polynomial might need to be cubic
- The choice of x=2 leads to division by zero (P(3)=0) in the actual solution
- The program doesn't handle the case where denominators become zero

4. Correct Approach:
- We should try a cubic polynomial
- Need to choose x values carefully to avoid zero denominators
- Should verify the solution satisfies the original functional equation

The original program is rejected because:
1. It assumes a quadratic solution which is insufficient
2. It fails to find any solution
3. It doesn't properly handle the functional equation constraints

<<<False>>>

Here's the corrected program:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, simplify

def solve_problem():
    # Try cubic polynomial since quadratic didn't work
    a, b, c, d = symbols('a b c d')
    x = symbols('x')
    P = a*x**3 + b*x**2 + c*x + d
    
    # Condition 1: P(1) = 1
    eq1 = Eq(P.subs(x, 1), 1)
    
    # From x=0: P(0)/P(1) = 8 - 56/7 = 0 → P(0) = 0 → d=0
    P = a*x**3 + b*x**2 + c*x
    eq1 = Eq(a + b + c, 1)  # Updated with d=0
    
    # Choose x=1: P(2)/P(2) = 1 = 8-56/8 = 1 → consistent
    # Choose x

Explanation:
The problem involves finding the value of a polynomial P evaluated at -1, given certain functional conditions. The original submission is empty (no program provided), so it cannot be accepted. We need to create a Python program that enumerates possible polynomial solutions and checks them against the given conditions.

The problem requires finding a polynomial P(x) that satisfies:
1. P(1) = 1
2. For all x ≠ -7, P(2x)/P(x+1) = 8 - 56/(x+7)

We can approach this by:
1. Assuming P is a quadratic polynomial (ax² + bx + c)
2. Using the given conditions to set up equations
3. Solving for the coefficients
4. Evaluating P(-1)

The solution will involve symbolic computation to solve for the polynomial coefficients. We'll use sympy for symbolic mathematics in Python.

<<<False>>>

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, simplify

def find_polynomial():
    x, a, b, c = symbols('x a b c')
    # Assume quadratic polynomial P(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c
    P = a*x**2 + b*x + c
    
    # Condition 1: P(1) = 1
    eq1 = Eq(P.subs(x, 1), 1)
    
    # Condition 2: P(2x)/P(x+1) = 8 - 56/(x+7) for x ≠ -7
    # We'll evaluate at x=0 and x=1 to get more equations
    # At x=0:
    eq2 = Eq(P.subs(x, 0)/P.subs(x, 1), 8 - 56/7)
    # At x=1:
    eq3 = Eq(P.subs(x, 2)/P.subs(x, 2), 8 - 56/8)
    
    # Solve the system of equations
    solution = solve([eq1, eq2, eq3], (a, b, c))
    
    if solution:
        a_val, b_val, c_val = solution[0]
        P_solved = a_val*x**2 + b_val*x + c_val
        # Evaluate at x = -1
        P_minus1 = P_solved.subs(x, -
