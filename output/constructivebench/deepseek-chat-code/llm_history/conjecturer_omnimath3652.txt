The error occurs because Lean interprets `0` as a Prop when it's used in the set definition, but we need it to be a function. The correct way is to use `Function.const ℝ 0` for the zero function and `fun x => x^2` for the quadratic solution.

From the enumerated answers, we see two solutions:
1. The zero function (f(x) = 0)
2. The quadratic function (f(x) = x²)

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<{f | f = Function.const ℝ 0 ∨ f = fun x => x^2}>>>

Explanation:
1. The zero function satisfies the equation trivially as all terms become zero
2. The quadratic function x² satisfies the equation because:
   - Left side: f(fx + fy + fz) = (x² + y² + z²)²
   - Right side: f(fx - fy) + f(2xy + fz) + 2f(xz - yz) = (x² - y²)² + (2xy + z²)² + 2(xz - yz)²
   - Both sides expand to x⁴ + y⁴ + z⁴ + 2x²y² + 2x²z² + 2y²z²

The set notation collects these two solutions, using proper Lean syntax for function equality.
