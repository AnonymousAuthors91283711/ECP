The problem involves finding the minimal value of `a₀` under certain conditions involving infinite series. We'll approach this by:

1. Understanding the constraints on the geometric series sums
2. Expressing the conditions mathematically
3. Enumerating possible values to find the minimal `a₀`

The key constraints are:
- Two geometric series with parameters (a₀, ra) and (b₀, rb)
- Both series sum to 1
- The product of their squared sums equals their term-wise product sum
- We need to find the minimal a₀ satisfying these conditions

```python
import math

def find_min_a0():
    min_a0 = None
    
    # We'll sample ra and rb values in (-1,1)
    for ra_steps in range(1, 20):
        ra = 0.9 * (ra_steps / 20)  # Sample from 0 to 0.9
        
        for rb_steps in range(1, 20):
            rb = 0.9 * (rb_steps / 20)
            
            # Calculate a0 and b0 from the series sum condition (sum = 1)
            a0 = 1 - ra
            b0 = 1 - rb
            
            # Calculate the three series sums
            sum_a_sq = sum((a0 * (ra**i))**2 for i in range(1000))  # Approximate infinite sum
            sum_b_sq = sum((b0 * (rb**i))**2 for i in range(1000))
            sum_ab = sum((a0 * (ra**i)) * (b0 * (rb**i)) for i in range(1000))
            
            # Check if the condition is approximately satisfied
            if abs(sum_a_sq * sum_b_sq - sum_ab) < 1e-6:
                if min_a0 is None or a0 < min_a0:
                    min_a0 = a0
                    print(f"New candidate: a0={a0:.6f} (ra={ra:.3f}, rb={rb:.3f})")
    
    if min_a0 is not None:
        print(f"\nMinimal a0 found: {min_a0:.6f}")
    else:
        print("No solution found in the sampled range")

find_min_a0()
```
