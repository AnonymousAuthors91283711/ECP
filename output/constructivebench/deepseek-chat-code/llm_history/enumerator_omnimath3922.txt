[write_program]
This problem asks whether there exists an integer-valued function `m` from the finite set `Fin 15` (numbers 0-14) to integers such that the sum of `m[k] * arctan(k+1)` for k=0 to 14 equals `arctan(16)`. We'll write a program to search for such integer coefficients.

The approach will be:
1. Generate all possible combinations of small integer coefficients (we'll limit to -3 to 3 range)
2. For each combination, compute the sum and compare with arctan(16)
3. Print any combinations that match within floating-point tolerance

```python
import math
from itertools import product

def main():
    target = math.atan(16)
    tolerance = 1e-6
    max_coeff = 3  # Maximum absolute value of coefficients to try
    
    # Generate all possible coefficient combinations (-max_coeff to max_coeff) for 15 terms
    for coeffs in product(range(-max_coeff, max_coeff+1), repeat=15):
        total = 0.0
        for k in range(15):
            total += coeffs[k] * math.atan(k + 1)
        
        if abs(total - target) < tolerance:
            print(f"Found matching coefficients: {coeffs}")
            # Uncomment to stop after first match (if any)
            # return

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
