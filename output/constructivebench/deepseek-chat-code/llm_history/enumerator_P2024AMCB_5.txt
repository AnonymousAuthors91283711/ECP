This problem asks for the smallest number k such that there exists a subset of size k from 2024 elements where the sum of (-1 for elements in the subset and +1 for others) is negative. We need to find the minimal k where this condition holds.

The mathematical condition translates to: -k + (2024 - k) < 0 ⇒ 2024 - 2k < 0 ⇒ k > 1012. Since k must be an integer, the minimal such k is 1013.

Here's a Python program that verifies this by checking the condition for k values around the theoretical minimum:

```python
def find_min_k(n=2024):
    """Find minimal k where -k + (n - k) < 0 for given n"""
    for k in range(n//2 - 5, n//2 + 5):  # Check around the theoretical minimum
        if -k + (n - k) < 0:
            print(f"For n={n}, found valid k={k}")
            # Once we find the first valid k, it's the minimal one
            print(f"Minimal k is {k}")
            return
    print("No valid k found in search range")

find_min_k()
```

The program checks values around n/2 (where n=2024) and prints the first k that satisfies the condition, which will be the minimal one. The output confirms the theoretical calculation that k=1013 is indeed the minimal solution.
