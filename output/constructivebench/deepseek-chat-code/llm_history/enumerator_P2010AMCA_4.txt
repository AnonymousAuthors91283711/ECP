[write_program]
This problem involves analyzing several inequalities involving a negative real number x. We'll write a Python program to explore these inequalities for various negative x values to understand their behavior. The program will test each condition for sample negative x values and print the results.

```python
import math

def test_conditions(x):
    # Condition 1: x/|x| ≤ 0
    cond1 = x / abs(x) <= 0
    
    # Condition 2: -x² ≤ 0
    cond2 = -x**2 <= 0
    
    # Condition 3: -2^x < 0
    cond3 = -(2**x) < 0
    
    # Condition 4: x^(1/3) < 0
    # Using math.pow for real exponents
    cond4 = math.pow(x, 1/3) < 0 if x >= 0 else -math.pow(-x, 1/3) < 0
    
    return (cond1, cond2, cond3, cond4)

# Test various negative x values
test_values = [-2.0, -1.0, -0.5, -0.1, -3.0, -10.0]

print("Testing conditions for negative x values:")
print("x\tx/|x|≤0\t-x²≤0\t-2ˣ<0\tx^(1/3)<0")
for x in test_values:
    c1, c2, c3, c4 = test_conditions(x)
    print(f"{x:.2f}\t{c1}\t{c2}\t{c3}\t{c4}")

# Additional verification for cube root of negative numbers
print("\nVerifying cube roots:")
for x in [-8, -1, -0.001]:
    cr = math.pow(x, 1/3) if x >= 0 else -math.pow(-x, 1/3)
    print(f"cube_root({x}) = {cr}")
```
