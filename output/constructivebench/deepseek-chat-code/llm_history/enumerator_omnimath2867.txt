[write_program]
This problem defines a recurrence relation with initial conditions and asks for the value of s(8). We'll write a Python program to compute the sequence values up to s(8) using the given recurrence relation.

The recurrence is:
- s(0) = 1
- s(1) = 4
- s(2) = 2
- s(3) = 3
- s(n+4) = s(n+3) + s(n+2) + s(n+1) + s(n) for n â‰¥ 0

We'll compute the sequence values iteratively up to s(8).

```python
def compute_sequence():
    # Initialize the sequence with given values
    s = [1, 4, 2, 3]
    
    # Compute up to s(8)
    for n in range(4, 9):
        next_val = s[n-1] + s[n-2] + s[n-3] + s[n-4]
        s.append(next_val)
        print(f"s({n}) = {next_val}")
    
    # The problem asks specifically for s(8), which will be the last printed value

compute_sequence()
```
