[write_program]
This problem involves finding the smallest positive integer n such that a certain sum involving cotangent functions equals 1. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of n and compute the sum for each, looking for when it equals 1.

The key observations:
1. The sum involves terms of the form 1/(cot(iπ/(n+1)) - cot(iπ/n))
2. We need to compute this sum for i from 1 to n
3. We're looking for the smallest n where this sum equals exactly 1

We'll use floating-point arithmetic for approximation, but check for values very close to 1 (within a small epsilon) due to potential floating-point errors.

```python
import math

def compute_sum(n):
    total = 0.0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        term1 = math.pi * i / (n + 1)
        term2 = math.pi * i / n
        cot1 = 1 / math.tan(term1) if math.tan(term1) != 0 else float('inf')
        cot2 = 1 / math.tan(term2) if math.tan(term2) != 0 else float('inf')
        denominator = cot1 - cot2
        if denominator != 0:
            total += 1 / denominator
    return total

epsilon = 1e-10
max_n = 100  # Reasonable upper bound based on problem context

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    s = compute_sum(n)
    print(f"n={n}: sum={s}")
    if abs(s - 1) < epsilon:
        print(f"Found candidate: n={n}")
        break
```
