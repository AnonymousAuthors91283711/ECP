This problem involves finding the sum of reciprocals of certain polynomial roots combinations. We'll approach it by:
1. Finding the roots of the polynomial x³ + 3x - 1
2. Calculating the sum for all distinct root pairs (x,y) of (x³ + y³)⁻¹
3. Expressing the result as a reduced fraction m/n
4. Computing 100m + n

We'll use numerical approximations to find the roots, then compute the sum exactly using symbolic computation.

```python
import numpy as np
from fractions import Fraction
from itertools import permutations

# Find roots of x^3 + 3x - 1 = 0
coeffs = [1, 0, 3, -1]
roots = np.roots(coeffs)

# Filter real roots (problem implies 3 distinct real roots)
real_roots = [r.real for r in roots if abs(r.imag) < 1e-10]

# Calculate the sum S = sum_{x≠y} 1/(x³ + y³)
total = Fraction(0, 1)
for x, y in permutations(real_roots, 2):
    denominator = x**3 + y**3
    if abs(denominator) > 1e-10:  # Avoid division by zero
        total += Fraction(1).limit_denominator(10**6) / Fraction(denominator).limit_denominator(10**6)

# Simplify the fraction
m, n = total.numerator, total.denominator
gcd_val = np.gcd(m, n)
m_reduced = m // gcd_val
n_reduced = n // gcd_val

# Compute the final answer
answer = 100 * m_reduced + n_reduced

print(f"Reduced fraction: {m_reduced}/{n_reduced}")
print(f"Final answer: {answer}")
```
