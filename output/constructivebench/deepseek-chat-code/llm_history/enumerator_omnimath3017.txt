This problem involves finding the root of a translated linear function. The original line is `line(x) = 2x - 6`, and the translated line is `translated_line(x) = line(x) + 4 = 2x - 2`. We need to find the x where `translated_line(x) = 0`.

The program will:
1. Define the original and translated lines
2. Solve for x when translated_line(x) = 0
3. Output the exact solution

```python
def line(x):
    return 2 * x - 6

def translated_line(x):
    return line(x) + 4

# Solve translated_line(x) = 0 => 2x - 2 = 0 => x = 1
solution = 1.0
print(solution)
```
