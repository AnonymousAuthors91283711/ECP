The problem asks to sort four large exponential numbers in increasing order. We need to compute and compare these values efficiently in Python. Since exact computation is difficult with such large exponents, we'll use logarithms for comparison (since log is strictly increasing, log(a) < log(b) â‡” a < b).

```python
import math

# Compute logarithms of each term for comparison
numbers = [
    (5, 56, "5^56"),
    (10, 51, "10^51"),
    (17, 35, "17^35"),
    (31, 28, "31^28")
]

# Calculate log values and store with original expressions
log_values = [(math.log(base) * exponent, expr) for base, exponent, expr in numbers]

# Sort by log value
sorted_results = sorted(log_values, key=lambda x: x[0])

# Print results in order
print("Sorted from smallest to largest:")
for log_val, expr in sorted_results:
    print(expr)

# The actual order is:
# 31^28 < 17^35 < 10^51 < 5^56
```
