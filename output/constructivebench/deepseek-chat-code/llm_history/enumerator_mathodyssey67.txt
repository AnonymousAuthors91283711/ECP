This problem involves finding a specific value for an expression involving trigonometric functions under certain constraints. We'll approach it by:

1. Using the given constraints to find relationships between the angles
2. Numerically searching for angles that satisfy all conditions
3. Calculating the target expression value

The key observation is that each ratio has the form k*tan(x)/(1+1/cos(x)) where k increases from 3 to 6. We'll search for angles that satisfy all constraints within the valid range (0, π/2).

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def f(k, x):
    """Computes k*tan(x)/(1 + 1/cos(x))"""
    return k * math.tan(x) / (1 + 1/math.cos(x))

def find_angles():
    """Search for angles satisfying all constraints"""
    # We'll search in small increments
    step = 0.0001
    target_sum = 2 * math.pi
    
    # Search for alpha in (0, pi/2)
    for alpha in np.arange(0.01, math.pi/2, step):
        # Compute the common value from first equation
        common_val = f(3, alpha)
        
        # Find beta that satisfies second equation
        try:
            beta = find_angle(4, common_val, alpha, step)
            if beta <= 0:
                continue
                
            # Find gamma that satisfies third equation
            gamma = find_angle(5, common_val, beta, step)
            if gamma <= 0:
                continue

            if abs(alpha + beta + gamma + delta - target_sum) < 0.001:
                print(f"Found angles: α={alpha:.4f}, β={beta:.4f}, γ={gamma:.4f}, δ={delta:.4f}")
                print(f"Common value: {common_val:.6f}")
                return common_val
        except:
            continue

    # The angles should be decreasing due to increasing k factors
    for x in np.arange(0.01, prev_angle, step):
        if abs(f(k, x) - target) < 1e-6:
            return x
    return -1

    result = find_angles()
