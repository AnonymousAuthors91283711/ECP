[write_program]
This problem asks for all real-valued functions f:ℝ→ℝ that satisfy:
1. f(0) ≠ 0
2. The functional equation: f(f(x)) + f(f(y)) = f(x+y) * f(x*y) for all x,y ∈ ℝ

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible polynomial solutions, as polynomials are often good candidates for functional equations. We'll test polynomial forms up to degree 4.

```python
import numpy as np
from itertools import product

def test_polynomial(coeffs):
    """Test if polynomial with given coefficients satisfies the functional equation."""
    def f(x):
        return sum(c * (x**i) for i, c in enumerate(coeffs))
    
    # Test random points to check if equation holds
    test_points = [0.5, 1.0, 2.0, -1.0, 3.0]
    for x, y in product(test_points, repeat=2):
        lhs = f(f(x)) + f(f(y))
        rhs = f(x + y) * f(x * y)
        if not np.isclose(lhs, rhs, rtol=1e-6):
            return False
    
    # Check f(0) != 0 condition
    if np.isclose(f(0), 0):
        return False
    
    return True

def enumerate_polynomials(max_degree=4):
    """Enumerate polynomials up to given degree that satisfy the conditions."""
    print("Searching for polynomial solutions...")
    print("Format: [a0, a1, a2, ...] where f(x) = a0 + a1*x + a2*x^2 + ...")
    
    for degree in range(1, max_degree + 1):
        # Generate coefficient combinations (-5 to 5 range)
        for coeffs in product(range(-5, 6), repeat=degree + 1):
            if test_polynomial(coeffs):
                print(f"Found solution: {list(coeffs)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_polynomials()
```
