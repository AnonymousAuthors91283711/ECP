This problem involves finding integers that satisfy multiple conditions, including arithmetic and geometric progression relationships. We'll enumerate possible values for the initial term (P2016AIMEII_1_answer) and verify the conditions.

```python
def solve():
    # We'll search for P2016AIMEII_1_answer (let's call it 'a') up to 444
    for a in range(1, 445):
        # The sum condition gives us a + b + c = 444
        # From geometric progression conditions: b = a*r, c = a*r^2
        # So a + a*r + a*r^2 = 444 => a(1 + r + r^2) = 444
        # Therefore (1 + r + r^2) must divide 444
        
        # Find possible r values (must be integer since b and c are integers)
        for r in range(2, int((444/a)**0.5) + 2):
            if a * (1 + r + r*r) == 444:
                b = a * r
                c = a * r * r
                # Check the arithmetic progression condition
                # (a-5) + d = (b-9) and (b-9) + d = (c-25)
                # This implies 2(b-9) = (a-5) + (c-25)
                if 2*(b-9) == (a-5) + (c-25):
                    d = (b-9) - (a-5)
                    # Verify all conditions
                    if (a < b < c and 
                        a + b + c == 444 and
                        b == a * r and
                        c == a * r * r and
                        (a-5) + d == (b-9) and
                        (b-9) + d == (c-25)):
                        print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, r={r}, d={d}")
                        return  # Stop after finding first valid solution (smallest a)
    
    print("No solution found")

solve()
```
