Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 7 column 36, which is at "let valid := {c : co" in "  let colorings := (Fin 6 → Bool)   let valid := {c : colorings | ∃ (orientation : Fin 6 → Fin 4), ", there is an error: expected ';' or line break.
. Enumerated Answers: Valid colorings: 20/64
Probability: 20/64 = 0.3125. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Based on the error message and the enumerated answers, I notice that:
1. The problem is about counting valid cube colorings where certain conditions hold
2. The enumerated answer shows 20 valid colorings out of 64 total, which simplifies to 5/16
3. The error appears to be a syntax issue in the theorem statement

The correct answer should be the simplified form of 20/64, which is 5/16. The error in the theorem statement is likely due to missing line breaks or semicolons between definitions, but since we're only asked for the answer value, we'll focus on that.

Here's the correct answer in Lean:

<<<5/16>>>

Explanation:
- The problem involves counting valid colorings of a cube's faces under certain constraints
- From the enumeration, there are 20 valid colorings out of 64 possible (since 2^6 = 64 for 6 faces with 2 colors each)
- 20/64 simplifies to 5/16 when dividing numerator and denominator by 4
- The answer is given as a rational number (ℚ) as required by the problem statement[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
