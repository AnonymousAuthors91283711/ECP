This problem asks for the number of ordered triples (a, b, c) of positive integers where a < b < c and a + b + c = 66. We'll enumerate all possible combinations efficiently by iterating through possible values of a and b, then calculating c and checking the constraints.

```python
def count_triples():
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, 22):  # a can be at most 21 since 21+22+23=66
        # b must be between a+1 and (66-a-1)/2 to leave room for c > b
        min_b = a + 1
        max_b = (65 - a) // 2
        for b in range(min_b, max_b + 1):
            c = 66 - a - b
            if c > b:
                count += 1
                print(f"Found triple: ({a}, {b}, {c})")  # Streaming partial results
    print(f"Total number of triples: {count}")

count_triples()
```
