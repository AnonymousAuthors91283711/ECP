[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of three equations with three variables (a, b, c). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible real solutions by checking small rational values and looking for patterns.

The approach will:
1. Iterate through possible small integer values for a, b, c
2. Check if they satisfy all three equations
3. Print valid solutions and their product a*b*c
4. Look for patterns in the solutions

```python
def solve_equations():
    # Check small integer values first
    for a in range(-5, 6):
        for b in range(-5, 6):
            for c in range(-5, 6):
                # Check all three equations
                eq1 = a**2 + b == c**2
                eq2 = b**2 + c == a**2
                eq3 = c**2 + a == b**2
                if eq1 and eq2 and eq3:
                    product = a * b * c
                    print(f"Solution found: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, product={product}")
    
    # Check for non-integer solutions using a=0 as a special case
    # From equation 3: c^2 + 0 = b^2 => b = ±c
    # From equation 1: 0 + b = c^2 => b = c^2
    # Combining: c^2 = ±c => c=0 or c=±1
    # Check c=0: b=0, then equation 2: 0+0=0 (valid)
    # Check c=1: b=1, equation 2: 1+1=0 (invalid)
    # Check c=-1: b=1, equation 2: 1-1=0 (valid)
    print("\nSpecial case solutions:")
    print("a=0, b=0, c=0, product=0")
    print("a=0, b=1, c=-1, product=0")
    
    # Check symmetric solution where a=b=c
    # All equations become x^2 + x = x^2 => x=0
    print("\nSymmetric solution:")
    print("a=0, b=0, c=0, product=0")
