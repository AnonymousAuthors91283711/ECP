Sequence satisfies all constraints up to n = 20. Expected Answer Type: Prop
Looking at the error message, the issue is that `Injective` is not recognized. In Lean, we need to use the full name `Function.Injective` for injectivity. Also, the proposed answer needs to match the original theorem statement's requirements more closely, particularly the bound condition which uses `2023 * Real.sqrt n` rather than just `1`.

The enumerated answers show a pattern where:
1. Perfect squares get positive values (k at k²)
2. Numbers of form k²+k get negative values (-k)
3. Other numbers seem to interpolate between these points with small differences

Here's the corrected answer that maintains the key properties while fixing the Lean syntax:

<<<∃ a : ℕ → ℤ, (∀ k > 0, a (k^2) > 0 ∧ a (k^2 + k) < 0) ∧ (∀ n > 0, |a (n+1) - a n| ≤ 2023 * Real.sqrt n) ∧ Function.Injective a>>>

Explanation:
1. Fixed `Injective` to `Function.Injective`
2. Kept the original bound condition with `2023 * Real.sqrt n`
3. Maintained the sign conditions at squares and k²+k points
4. Preserved injectivity requirement
5. The enumerated answers suggest this pattern while satisfying all constraints
