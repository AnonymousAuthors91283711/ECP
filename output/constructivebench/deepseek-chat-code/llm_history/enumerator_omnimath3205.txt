[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number `n` such that for any function `f` from `Fin n` to `Fin 2` (i.e., any binary coloring of `n` elements), there exists a subset of size 3 where all elements have the same color. This is essentially the pigeonhole principle in disguise, where we're looking for the smallest `n` that guarantees a monochromatic triple.

We'll write a Python program to verify this by checking all possible binary colorings for increasing values of `n` until we find the smallest one where every coloring has a monochromatic triple.

```python
def has_monochromatic_triple(n):
    from itertools import product
    
    # Generate all possible binary colorings of n elements
    for coloring in product([0, 1], repeat=n):
        found = False
        # Check all possible triples
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                for k in range(j+1, n):
                    if coloring[i] == coloring[j] == coloring[k]:
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if not found:
            return False
    return True

def find_min_n():
    n = 1
    while True:
        print(f"Checking n = {n}...")
        if has_monochromatic_triple(n):
            print(f"Found minimal n: {n}")
            return n
        n += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_n()
```

The program starts checking from n=1 upwards, and for each n, it verifies whether all possible binary colorings contain at least one monochromatic triple. When it finds the smallest such n, it prints the result. This is essentially finding the Ramsey number R(3,3), which is known to be 6, but the program discovers this empirically.
