Ground Truth Answer: 864
Proposed Answer: 8 * 7 * 6 + 8 * 7 * 4 + 8 * 7 * 4 + 8 * 7 * 4 + 8 * 7 * 4 + 8 * 7 * 4 + 8 * 7 * 4 + 8 * 7 * 4
Let's analyze the proposed answer:

1. The ground truth answer is 864
2. The proposed answer is a sum of terms: 8*7*6 + 7 terms of 8*7*4
3. Calculating the proposed answer:
   - 8*7*6 = 336
   - 7 * (8*7*4) = 7 * 224 = 1568
   - Total = 336 + 1568 = 1904

The proposed answer (1904) does not match the ground truth answer (864). The calculation shows they are clearly different.
