Ground Truth Answer: {P | ∃ (d : ℕ) (c : ℤ), P = X ^ d + C c ∨ P = - (X ^ d + C c) ∧ d > 0}
Proposed Answer: {P : ℤ[X] | ∀ (n : ℕ), P.coeff n ∈ ({-1, 0, 1} : Set ℤ)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about characterizing integer polynomials P where if P takes integer values at two real points s and t, then it must take an integer value at their product s*t.

2. The ground truth answer states that such polynomials must be of the form ±(X^d + c) where d is a positive natural number and c is an integer.

3. The proposed answer claims that such polynomials are those whose coefficients are all in {-1, 0, 1}.

These are clearly different characterizations:
- The ground truth allows arbitrary integer constant terms and only monomials of form X^d
- The proposed answer allows any combination of coefficients as long as they're in {-1,0,1}

For example:
- X^2 + 5 is in ground truth but not in proposed answer (coefficient 5 ∉ {-1,0,1})
- X + X^2 is in proposed answer but not in ground truth (doesn't match the form ±(X^d + c))
