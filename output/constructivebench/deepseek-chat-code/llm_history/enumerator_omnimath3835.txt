[write_program]
This problem asks for integer solutions (m, n) to the equation m^5 - n^5 = 16*m*n. We'll write a Python program to search for small integer solutions by enumerating possible values of m and n within a reasonable range.

The approach will be:
1. Iterate through possible integer values of m and n within a symmetric range
2. For each pair (m, n), check if it satisfies the equation
3. Print valid solutions as they are found
4. Since the equation is symmetric in m and n (up to sign), we can optimize by only checking cases where |m| â‰¥ |n|

```python
def find_solutions(max_abs=100):
    """Find integer solutions to m^5 - n^5 = 16*m*n within given range"""
    solutions = []
    for m in range(-max_abs, max_abs + 1):
        if m == 0:
            continue  # would make right side 0, left side -n^5, only solution n=0
        for n in range(-max_abs, max_abs + 1):
            if n == 0:
                continue  # similar to m=0 case
            if m**5 - n**5 == 16 * m * n:
                solutions.append((m, n))
                print(f"Found solution: ({m}, {n})")
    
    # Also check the special cases where m or n is 0
    for n in range(-max_abs, max_abs + 1):
        if 0**5 - n**5 == 16 * 0 * n:  # reduces to n=0
            if n == 0:
                solutions.append((0, 0))
                print("Found solution: (0, 0)")
    
    for m in range(-max_abs, max_abs + 1):
        if m**5 - 0**5 == 16 * m * 0:  # reduces to m=0
            if m == 0 and (0, 0) not in solutions:
                solutions.append((0, 0))
                print("Found solution: (0, 0)")
    
    return solutions

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Searching for solutions to m^5 - n^5 = 16*m*n...")
    sols = find_solutions()
    if not sols:
        print("No solutions found in the search range.")
    else:
        print("Search complete. Solutions found:")
        for s in sols:
            print(s)
```
