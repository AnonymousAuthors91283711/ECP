This problem involves finding all real numbers x between 0 and 360 degrees that satisfy a trigonometric equation. The equation involves cosine and sine functions with specific angles. We'll write a Python program to numerically search for solutions within the given range.

The approach will be:
1. Convert degrees to radians for trigonometric calculations
2. Evaluate both sides of the equation for x values in (0,360)
3. Check when the absolute difference between both sides is below a small threshold (1e-10)
4. Print any x values that satisfy the equation within this tolerance

```python
import math

def find_solutions():
    # Constants from the equation
    left_side = math.sqrt(3) * math.cos(10 * math.pi / 180)
    threshold = 1e-10
    
    print("Searching for solutions x in (0,360) that satisfy:")
    print(f"√3 * cos(10°) = cos(40°) + sin(x°)")
    print("Potential solutions:")
    
    # Check every 0.01 degrees for precision
    step = 0.01
    for x in range(0, 36000):
        x_deg = x * step
        rad = x_deg * math.pi / 180
        right_side = math.cos(40 * math.pi / 180) + math.sin(rad)
        
        if abs(left_side - right_side) < threshold:
            print(f"x ≈ {x_deg:.2f}°")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solutions()
```
