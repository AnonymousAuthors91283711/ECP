The problem asks for the maximum rational number `r` less than 1 that can be expressed in a specific form involving sums of fractions with denominators 7 and 49, and an infinite geometric series. The final answer is the sum of the numerator and denominator of this maximal `r`.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Enumerate all possible pairs (A, B) where A, B are integers from 0 to 6 (Fin 7) with A â‰  B
2. Compute the corresponding r value for each valid pair
3. Keep track of the maximum r found
4. Finally output the sum of numerator and denominator of the maximal r

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve():
    max_r = Fraction(0, 1)
    # Geometric series sum: 1/(1-1/49) = 49/48
    geo_sum = Fraction(49, 48)
    
    for A in range(7):
        for B in range(7):
            if A == B:
                continue
            term1 = Fraction(A, 7)
            term2 = Fraction(B, 49)
            series_factor = term1 + term2
            r = term1 + term2 + series_factor * geo_sum
            if r < 1 and r > max_r:
                max_r = r
                print(f"New max r found: {r} (A={A}, B={B})")
    
    print(f"\nFinal answer (num + den): {max_r.numerator + max_r.denominator}")

solve()
```
