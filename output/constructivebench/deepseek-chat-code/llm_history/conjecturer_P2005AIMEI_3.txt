Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the enumerated answers, they appear to be numbers with exactly 3 proper divisors less than 50. These are numbers that are either:
1. Product of two distinct primes p*q where p,q < 50
2. Cubes of primes p^3 where p < 50

The count of such numbers up to 2500 is what's being asked. Based on the pattern, the answer is the count of semiprimes and prime cubes meeting these conditions.
