[write_program]
The problem asks to find all integer pairs (n, m) such that 2^(3^|n|) = 3^(2^|m|) - 1. We'll write a Python program to search for such pairs by testing small integer values.

The approach:
1. Iterate over possible values of n and m (we'll limit to small absolute values)
2. For each pair, compute both sides of the equation
3. Check if they satisfy the equation
4. Print valid pairs immediately when found

We'll use Python's arbitrary-precision integers to handle large exponents.

```python
def omnimath1492_search(max_n=5, max_m=5):
    """Search for integer solutions to 2^(3^|n|) = 3^(2^|m|) - 1"""
    print(f"Searching for solutions with |n| <= {max_n}, |m| <= {max_m}")
    
    found = False
    for n in range(-max_n, max_n + 1):
        for m in range(-max_m, max_m + 1):
            if n == 0 or m == 0:  # Skip cases that would make exponents 1 or 0
                continue
                
            left = 2 ** (3 ** abs(n))
            right = (3 ** (2 ** abs(m))) - 1
            
            if left == right:
                print(f"Found solution: (n, m) = ({n}, {m})")
                found = True
                
    if not found:
        print("No solutions found in the search range")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    omnimath1492_search()
