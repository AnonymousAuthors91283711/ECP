Ground Truth Answer: (257, 258)
Proposed Answer: (37225, 117649)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about calculating the probability that two independent trials of a certain coin flipping experiment result in the same number of heads.

2. The ground truth answer is (257, 258), which suggests a probability very close to 1 (257/258 ≈ 0.99612).

3. The proposed answer is (37225, 117649), which gives a probability of about 0.3164 (37225/117649 ≈ 0.3164).

4. The ground truth answer makes sense for a probability of "same number of heads" in this context, as it should be very high (close to 1). The proposed answer gives a much lower probability that doesn't match our expectation for this type of problem.

5. The calculations in the problem statement show that the probability should be the sum of squares of individual probabilities for each possible number of heads (0 through 3). The proposed answer doesn't match what we would expect from these calculations.
