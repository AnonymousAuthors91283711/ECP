The problem asks for the greatest power of 3 that divides the product P = 1 × 3 × 5 × ... × 199 (product of first 100 odd numbers). We need to count the total number of factors of 3 in the prime factorization of P.

The approach is to:
1. For each odd number (2k+1) in the product, count its factors of 3
2. Sum these counts across all numbers
3. The sum gives the highest power of 3 dividing P

We'll implement this by:
1. Iterating through all odd numbers from 1 to 199
2. For each number, count its factors of 3
3. Accumulate the total count

```python
def count_factors(n, p):
    """Count number of factors p in n"""
    count = 0
    while n % p == 0 and n != 0:
        count += 1
        n = n // p
    return count

total = 0
for k in range(100):
    num = 2 * k + 1  # generates 1, 3, 5,..., 199
    total += count_factors(num, 3)

print(f"Total factors of 3 in product: {total}")
```
