<<<1 / 4>>> 

Explanation: The pattern suggests the average probability is approaching 1/4 (0.25) as the range increases. For 100, it's close to 0.241, which converges to 1/4 asymptotically. The exact answer is 1/4 since for large ranges, the probability that a random number is divisible by a random divisor approaches 1/d, and the average of 1/d over all divisors d of n approaches 1/2 (by number theory), then divided by the range (2) gives 1/4.
