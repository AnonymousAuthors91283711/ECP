Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2 * 2 ^ n + (-1) ^ n) / 3
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (2^(n + 1) + (-1)^n) / 3
Let's analyze the two answers:

Ground Truth: (2 * 2^n + (-1)^n)/3
Proposed: (2^(n+1) + (-1)^n)/3

Notice that 2 * 2^n = 2^(n+1) by exponent rules. Therefore the two expressions are mathematically identical.

The proposed answer is just a simplified version of the ground truth answer.
