[write_program]
This problem involves computing the value at position (7,7) in an 8x8 grid defined by specific recurrence relations. The grid has:
1. First row and first column filled with 1s
2. Each other cell is the sum of all cells above and to the left of it

We'll write a Python program to compute this grid and print the value at (7,7). The solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently build the grid.

```python
def compute_grid():
    # Initialize 8x8 grid with 1s in first row and column
    grid = [[1 for _ in range(8)] for _ in range(8)]
    
    # Fill the rest of the grid using the recurrence relation
    for i in range(1, 8):
        for j in range(1, 8):
            total = 0
            for k in range(i):
                for l in range(j):
                    total += grid[k][l]
            grid[i][j] = total
    
    # Print the value at (7,7)
    print(grid[7][7])

compute_grid()
```
