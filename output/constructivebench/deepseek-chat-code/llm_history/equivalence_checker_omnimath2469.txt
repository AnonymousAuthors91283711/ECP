Ground Truth Answer: Real.sqrt (Real.sqrt 2)
Proposed Answer: Real.sqrt 2
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is asking for the maximum value of the function 2^(x*(1-x)) on the interval [0,1]. 

1. First, let's find the maximum of the exponent x*(1-x):
   - This is a quadratic function that reaches its maximum at x=0.5
   - The maximum value is 0.5*(1-0.5) = 0.25

2. Therefore, the maximum of 2^(x*(1-x)) would be 2^0.25 = 2^(1/4)

3. Now let's evaluate the answers:
   - Ground truth: √(√2) = (2^(1/2))^(1/2) = 2^(1/4)
   - Proposed answer: √2 = 2^(1/2)

The proposed answer gives 2^(1/2) while the correct maximum is 2^(1/4). These are clearly different values.
