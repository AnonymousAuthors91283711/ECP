theorem P2017AMCA_20 : 
  Nat.card {p : ℝ × ℤ | let (a, b) := p; 
    0 < a ∧ 2 ≤ b ∧ b ≤ 200 ∧

From the problem statement and enumerated count of 597 solutions, we can observe that:
1. The condition involves logarithms with base a and argument b
2. The equation simplifies to cases where a = b or a = 1/b
3. For b ranging from 2 to 200, each b gives 3 solutions (a=b, a=1/b, and a=b^(-1/2016))
4. 199 possible b values × 3 solutions each = 597 total solutions
