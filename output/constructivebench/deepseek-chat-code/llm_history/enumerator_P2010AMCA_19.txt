[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that the product of (k/(k+1)) for k from 0 to n-1 is less than 1/2010. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal n by computing the product incrementally until it falls below the threshold.

The product can be simplified using telescoping: ‚àè(k=0 to n-1) k/(k+1) = 0/1 * 1/2 * 2/3 * ... * (n-1)/n = 1/n. So we're essentially looking for the smallest n where 1/n < 1/2010, which is n > 2010. But we'll verify this computationally.

```python
def find_min_n():
    threshold = 1 / 2010
    product = 1.0
    for n in range(1, 2100):  # Search up to 2100 to be safe
        product *= (n - 1) / n  # This is equivalent to 1/n
        if product < threshold:
            print(f"Found n = {n} with product = {product}")
            return n

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_n()
```
