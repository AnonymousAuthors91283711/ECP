Current Proposed Answer: 1 / 5040.

. Enumerated Answers: The exact probability is: 1/5040. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
From the problem statement and error message, I can see this is about calculating a probability where:
1. Total possible sequences is 7! (7 factorial) = 5040
2. Desired sequences is 1
3. The probability is 1/5040

The error occurs because Lean expects proper line breaks between let bindings. The correct answer should be the rational number 1/5040. Here's the fixed version:

<<<1 / 5040>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem involves calculating a probability where there's exactly 1 desired outcome out of 7! possible outcomes
2. 7! = 7×6×5×4×3×2×1 = 5040
3. The probability is simply the ratio 1/5040
4. The error was due to missing line breaks in the let bindings, but the core mathematical answer remains 1/5040
5. The answer is given as a ℚ (rational number) as required by the theorem statement[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
