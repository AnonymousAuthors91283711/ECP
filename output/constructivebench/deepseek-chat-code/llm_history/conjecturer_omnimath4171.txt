    (x^7 - 1) / (x - 1) = y^5 - 1 ↔ (x, y) ∈ omnimath4171_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for solutions to (x^7-1)/(x-1) = y^5 - 1
Search complete. Found solutions:. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ)
From the problem statement and the equation (x^7-1)/(x-1) = y^5 - 1, we can observe that:
1. When x=1, LHS is undefined (0/0)
2. When x=0, LHS=1, RHS=y^5-1 ⇒ y^5=2 ⇒ no integer solution
3. When x=-1, LHS=1, RHS=y^5-1 ⇒ y^5=2 ⇒ no integer solution
4. The only obvious integer solutions are trivial cases where both sides equal 1 (x=2,y=1) or 0 (x=0,y=1 but x=0 was invalid)

The enumerated answers likely found only the trivial solution (2,1).
