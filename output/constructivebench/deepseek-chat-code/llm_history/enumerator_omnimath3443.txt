[write_program]
This problem is asking to find a rational number x such that 3/4 + 4/x = 1. We can solve this algebraically by rearranging the equation to find x = -16. However, to verify this programmatically, we'll enumerate rational numbers around this expected solution.

The program will:
1. Enumerate integers around -16 to verify the solution
2. Print each candidate and whether it satisfies the equation (as exact fractions)
3. Confirm when the correct solution is found

```python
def solve_equation():
    # We know the algebraic solution is x = -16, so we'll check around that
    for x in range(-20, -10):
        # Check if 3/4 + 4/x equals 1
        left_side = 3/4 + 4/x
        if abs(left_side - 1) < 1e-10:  # Floating point comparison with tolerance
            print(f"Found candidate x = {x} (approximate check)")
    
    # Now check exact fractions
    from fractions import Fraction
    x = Fraction(-16)
    left_side = Fraction(3,4) + Fraction(4)/x
    print(f"Exact check for x = {x}: 3/4 + 4/x = {left_side}")
