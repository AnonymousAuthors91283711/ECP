theorem omnimath3038 : 
  8 * omnimath3038_answer = 26 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 26 / 8
Proposed Answer: 13/4
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer 13/4 is equivalent to the ground truth answer 26/8, as they both simplify to the same reduced form (13/4 = 26/8 when simplified). Both answers satisfy the equation 8 * x = 26 when substituted for x.
