This problem involves finding a unique distance `d` that satisfies a specific travel time condition. We'll translate the mathematical conditions into Python code to enumerate possible values of `d` and check the equation.

The key equation is:
1 + (d-35)/50 = (d/35 - 1) - 0.5

We'll solve this numerically by testing values of `d` in small increments and checking when both sides are approximately equal.

```python
def find_d():
    v1 = 35
    v2 = v1 + 15
    epsilon = 1e-6  # Tolerance for floating point comparison
    
    # We know d must be greater than 35 (since d1=35 and d2=d-35 must be positive)
    d = 35.0
    step = 0.0001  # Small step size for precision
    
    while True:
        d1 = v1 * 1
        d2 = d - d1
        t2 = d2 / v2
        total_time = 1 + t2
        scheduled_time = d / v1 - 1
        difference = total_time - (scheduled_time - 0.5)
        
        if abs(difference) < epsilon:
            print(f"Found potential solution: d = {d}")
            # Verify if this is the exact solution by solving the equation
            # The equation simplifies to: 1 + (d-35)/50 = d/35 - 1.5
            # Multiply both sides by 350 to eliminate denominators:
            # 350 + 7(d-35) = 10d - 525
            # 350 + 7d - 245 = 10d - 525
            # 105 + 7d = 10d - 525
            # 630 = 3d
            # d = 210
            # So we expect the exact solution to be 210
            if abs(d - 210) < epsilon:
                print("Exact solution confirmed: d = 210")
                return
        d += step

find_d()
```
