Ground Truth Answer: 2 ^ 1006 * Real.sqrt (2 ^ 2010 + 2) - 2 ^ 2011
Proposed Answer: 2 - 2^(2 - 2013)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence with square roots and asks for the value of aₙ at n=2012.
2. The ground truth answer involves very large exponents (2¹⁰⁰⁶ and 2²⁰¹¹) and a square root term.
3. The proposed answer is a simple expression 2 - 2^(2-2013) which simplifies to 2 - 2^(-2011).

The proposed answer is:
- Much simpler than the ground truth
- Doesn't involve any square roots
- Doesn't match the scale of the ground truth (which has terms like 2²⁰¹¹)
- The proposed answer approaches 2 as n grows, while the ground truth grows exponentially

The two answers are clearly not equivalent. The proposed answer doesn't match the complexity or behavior of the recursive sequence defined in the problem.
