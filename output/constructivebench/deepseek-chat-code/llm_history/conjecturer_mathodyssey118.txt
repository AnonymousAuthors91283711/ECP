From the error message and problem statement, we can see that `mathodyssey118_answer` needs to be a specific natural number (type ℕ), not a function (type ℕ → ℕ). The enumerated answers show a clear pattern where for any k (like k=100 in the problem), the minimal n is always k+1.

The problem is about finding the smallest n such that for any positive real-valued function f on Fin 100, there exists an injective sequence s of length n where each element is either one of the f(i) values or a sum of some subset of them.

The pattern in the enumerated answers suggests the solution is simply k+1, where k is the size of the domain (100 in this case). Since the problem is specifically about k=100, we should return 101.

<<<101>>>

Explanation: The minimal n is always one more than the size of the domain (k) because:
1. We need at least k elements to cover all individual f(i) values
2. We need one additional element to represent the empty sum (0), but since f(i) > 0, the empty sum isn't needed
3. The pattern in enumerated answers shows n = k+1 works for all cases
4. For k=100, the answer is 101
