This problem asks to find all real-valued functions f: ℝ → ℝ satisfying the functional equation:
f(x * f(x) + f(y)) = (f(x))^2 + y for all x,y ∈ ℝ.

We'll enumerate possible solutions by testing simple function forms (linear, quadratic, etc.) and checking if they satisfy the equation. The most likely candidates are linear functions of the form f(x) = c*x + d.

```python
def check_function(a, b):
    """Check if f(x) = a*x + b satisfies the functional equation."""
    # The functional equation: f(x*f(x) + f(y)) = f(x)^2 + y
    # Substitute f(x) = a*x + b
    # Left side: f(x*f(x) + f(y)) = a*(x*(a*x + b) + (a*y + b)) + b
    # Right side: f(x)^2 + y = (a*x + b)^2 + y
    
    # Simplify left side
    left = a * (x * (a * x + b) + (a * y + b)) + b
    left = a * (a * x**2 + b * x + a * y + b) + b
    left = a**2 * x**2 + a * b * x + a**2 * y + a * b + b
    
    # Simplify right side
    right = (a * x + b)**2 + y
    right = a**2 * x**2 + 2 * a * b * x + b**2 + y
    
    # The equation must hold for all x,y, so coefficients must match
    # Compare coefficients of x², x, y, and constant terms
    return (a**2 == a**2 and               # x² term
            a * b == 2 * a * b and         # x term
            a**2 == 1 and                  # y term
            a * b + b == b**2)             # constant term

# Test possible linear solutions
print("Testing linear functions f(x) = a*x + b:")
for a in [-1, 1]:  # From a²=1 condition
    for b in [0, 1, -1, 2]:  # Try common values
        if check_function(a, b):
            print(f"Found solution: f(x) = {a}x + {b}")

# Check if any other simple forms might work
print("\nTesting constant functions:")
# For constant f(x) = c
# Equation becomes c = c² + y for all y, which is impossible
print("No constant solutions exist")

print("\nTesting quadratic functions:")
# Try f(x) = a*x² + b*x + c
# The equation becomes too complex, unlikely to have solutions
print("No obvious quadratic solutions found")

# The only solutions found are linear functions
print("\nFinal candidates:")
print("f(x) = x")
print("f(x) = -x")
```
