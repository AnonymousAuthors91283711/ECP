Ground Truth Answer: 3 / 40
Proposed Answer: 1 / 13
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves comparing two series:
   - fouryseries(x) = Σ (4 * x^n)
   - fourierseries(x) = Σ (4 * 10^n * x^n)

2. The equation given is fourierseries(x) = 4 * fouryseries(x)

3. For |x| < 1, fouryseries converges to 4/(1-x)
4. For |10x| < 1 (i.e., x < 0.1), fourierseries converges to 4/(1-10x)

5. Setting them equal: 4/(1-10x) = 4 * 4/(1-x)
   Simplifies to: 1/(1-10x) = 4/(1-x)
   Then: 1-x = 4-40x
   39x = 3
   x = 3/39 = 1/13

The ground truth answer is 3/40, but the correct solution leads to 1/13. The proposed answer is actually correct while the ground truth answer is incorrect.
