[write_program]
This problem involves finding a natural number `n` such that a degree `3n` polynomial `P` satisfies specific conditions at certain points. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible `n` values and check the conditions.

The approach:
1. For small `n` values, construct the polynomial `P` that satisfies the given conditions.
2. Check if `P(3n+1) = 730` holds for each candidate `n`.
3. Since the polynomial has degree `3n`, we'll need at least `3n+1` points to uniquely determine it.

```python
import numpy as np

def find_n(max_n=10):
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        # Points where P is defined
        x_points = []
        y_points = []
        
        # Add conditions for k ≤ n: P(3k) = 2
        for k in range(n + 1):
            x_points.append(3 * k)
            y_points.append(2)
        
        # Add conditions for k ≤ n-1: P(3k+1) = 1
        for k in range(n):
            x_points.append(3 * k + 1)
            y_points.append(1)
        
        # Add conditions for k ≤ n-1: P(3k+2) = 0
        for k in range(n):
            x_points.append(3 * k + 2)
            y_points.append(0)
        
        # We need one more point to determine the degree 3n polynomial
        # The problem gives P(3n+1) = 730 as the condition
        
        # Fit polynomial of degree 3n through all points except last condition
        degree = 3 * n
        if len(x_points) < degree + 1:
            continue  # Not enough points to determine polynomial
            
        coeffs = np.polyfit(x_points, y_points, degree)
        poly = np.poly1d(coeffs)
        
        # Check the additional condition P(3n+1) = 730
        if abs(poly(3 * n + 1) - 730) < 1e-6:  # Account for floating point errors
            print(f"Found candidate n = {n}")
            return n
    
    print("No solution found in the search range")
    return None
