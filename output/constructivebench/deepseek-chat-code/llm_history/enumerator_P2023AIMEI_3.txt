This problem involves combinatorics and binomial coefficients. We need to compute the value of t2 given the formula involving combinations (n choose k). The problem is from AIME 2023, so we'll implement the exact computation in Python.

The formula for t2 is:
t2 = C(n,2) - (3*C(t3,2) + 4*C(t4,2) + 5*C(t5,2) + 6*C(t6,2))
where n=40, t3=3, t4=4, t5=5, t6=6, and C(n,k) is the binomial coefficient "n choose k".

We'll compute this directly using Python's math.comb function for exact integer results.

```python
import math

def compute_t2():
    n = 40
    t3, t4, t5, t6 = 3, 4, 5, 6
    
    # Compute each term separately
    C_n_2 = math.comb(n, 2)
    term3 = 3 * math.comb(t3, 2)
    term4 = 4 * math.comb(t4, 2)
    term5 = 5 * math.comb(t5, 2)
    term6 = 6 * math.comb(t6, 2)
    
    t2 = C_n_2 - (term3 + term4 + term5 + term6)
    return t2

# Compute and print the result
result = compute_t2()
print(result)
```
