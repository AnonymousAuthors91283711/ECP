[write_program]
The problem asks for the smallest natural number `s` such that there exist four distinct squares `a, b, c, d` where `a^b = c^d` and `a + b + c + d = s`. We'll write a Python program to search for such quadruples of squares.

Approach:
1. Generate squares up to a reasonable limit
2. Check all 4-tuples of distinct squares
3. Verify if `a^b == c^d`
4. Track the minimal sum found

```python
def find_minimal_sum():
    max_base = 20  # squares up to 20^2=400
    squares = [i*i for i in range(1, max_base+1)]
    min_sum = float('inf')
    found = False
    
    # Iterate through all possible 4-tuples of distinct squares
    for i1 in range(len(squares)):
        a = squares[i1]
        for i2 in range(len(squares)):
            b = squares[i2]
            if b == a:
                continue
            for i3 in range(len(squares)):
                c = squares[i3]
                if c == a or c == b:
                    continue
                for i4 in range(len(squares)):
                    d = squares[i4]
                    if d == a or d == b or d == c:
                        continue
                    if (a**b) == (c**d):
                        current_sum = a + b + c + d
                        print(f"Found: {a}^{b} = {c}^{d}, sum={current_sum}")
                        if current_sum < min_sum:
                            min_sum = current_sum
                            found = True
    
    if found:
        print(f"Minimal sum found: {min_sum}")
    else:
        print("No solution found in the search space")

find_minimal_sum()
```
