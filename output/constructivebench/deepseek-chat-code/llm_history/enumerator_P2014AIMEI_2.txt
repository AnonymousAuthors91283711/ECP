This problem involves solving for N in the equation (4*16 + 6*N)/(10*(16 + N)) = 58/100. We'll write a Python program to find the smallest positive integer N that satisfies this equation.

The approach is:
1. Simplify the equation algebraically
2. Iterate through possible N values until we find one that satisfies the equation
3. Since we're dealing with integers, we can check exact equality rather than approximations

```python
def solve():
    # The equation is (64 + 6N)/(160 + 10N) = 58/100
    # Cross multiply: 100*(64 + 6N) = 58*(160 + 10N)
    # Simplify: 6400 + 600N = 9280 + 580N
    # Rearrange: 20N = 2880
    # Solution: N = 144
    
    # But since the problem asks for enumeration, we'll verify this by checking N values
    for N in range(1, 200):  # We know the answer is 144, so 200 is safe
        numerator = 4*16 + 6*N
        denominator = 10*(16 + N)
        if 100 * numerator == 58 * denominator:  # Exact equality check
            print(f"Found solution: N = {N}")
            return
    
    print("No solution found in range")
