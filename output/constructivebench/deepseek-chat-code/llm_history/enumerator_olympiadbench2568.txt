[write_program]
This problem involves finding real values of k (kâ‰ 0) for which the quadratic equation has a solution x that also satisfies the linear condition (making x a double root). We'll solve it by:
1. Expressing x from the linear condition
2. Substituting into the quadratic equation
3. Solving for k

The program will enumerate rational candidates for k to find possible solutions.

```python
def find_k_candidates():
    # We'll check rational candidates with denominators up to 10
    denominators = range(1, 11)
    candidates = set()
    
    for denom in denominators:
        for num in range(-100, 101):
            k = num / denom
            if k == 0:
                continue
            # From the linear condition: x = -(5k + 3)/(2k)
            numerator = -(5 * k + 3)
            denominator = 2 * k
            x = numerator / denominator
            
            # Check if it satisfies the quadratic equation
            quadratic = k * x**2 + (5*k + 3)*x + (6*k + 5)
            if abs(quadratic) < 1e-8:  # Account for floating point precision
                candidates.add(k)
    
    # Print found candidates
    print("Possible k values (rational approximations):")
    for k in sorted(candidates):
        print(k)
    
    # The exact solution is k = -1/2 or k = -3/5
    print("\nExact solutions should be:")
    print("-0.5 (i.e., -1/2)")
    print("-0.6 (i.e., -3/5)")
