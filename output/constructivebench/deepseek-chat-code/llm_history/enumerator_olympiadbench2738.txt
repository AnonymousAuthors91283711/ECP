This problem involves finding all positive real numbers x such that log x = (3 + floor((log x)^2))/4, and then computing the product of all such x. The goal is to find y such that this product equals 10^y.

We'll approach this by:
1. Enumerating possible integer values for floor((log x)^2)
2. For each possible k, solving log x = (3 + k)/4
3. Checking if floor((log x)^2) indeed equals k
4. Collecting valid solutions and computing their product

```python
import math

def find_solutions():
    solutions = []
    # We'll check k values from 0 to 20 (since (log x)^2 grows quickly)
    for k in range(0, 21):
        # Calculate corresponding log x value
        log_x = (3 + k) / 4
        x = 10 ** log_x
        # Verify floor condition
        if math.floor(log_x ** 2) == k:
            solutions.append(x)
            print(f"Found solution: x = {x} (log10(x) = {log_x})")
    
    if solutions:
        product = 1.0
        for x in solutions:
            product *= x
        # Convert product to form 10^y
        y = math.log10(product)
        print(f"Product of solutions: {product} = 10^{y}")
    else:
        print("No solutions found")

find_solutions()
```
