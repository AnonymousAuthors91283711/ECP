This problem involves solving a system of equations with real numbers x and y. Given T=0, x+y=0, and x³-y³=54, we need to find the value of x. 

We can simplify the problem using the identity x³ - y³ = (x-y)(x² + xy + y²). Since x + y = 0, we can substitute y = -x. The equation becomes x³ - (-x)³ = 2x³ = 54, so x³ = 27 and x = 3.

The Python program will verify this by checking small real numbers around 3 to confirm the solution.

```python
def solve():
    # We know x + y = 0 and x^3 - y^3 = 54
    # Let's test x values around the expected solution
    for x in [2.9, 2.95, 2.99, 3.0, 3.01, 3.05, 3.1]:
        y = -x
        lhs = x**3 - y**3
        print(f"x={x}, lhs={lhs}")
    
    # The exact solution is x=3
    print("Exact solution found: x=3")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```
