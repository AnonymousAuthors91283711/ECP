[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimum number of planes needed to cover all non-zero integer points in the cube [1,n]×[1,n]×[1,n] in 3D space, excluding the origin. The planes must pass through the origin (since they can't contain (0,0,0)).

We'll write a Python program to enumerate the minimal number of planes needed for small values of n, looking for a pattern. The key observation is that we need planes covering all directions (x,y,z) where gcd(x,y,z)=1 (primitive vectors).

```python
import math
from itertools import product

def count_required_planes(n):
    # Generate all non-zero points in [1,n]^3
    points = set(product(range(1, n+1), repeat=3))
    points.discard((0,0,0))
    
    # We'll represent planes by their normal vectors (a,b,c) with gcd(a,b,c)=1
    planes = set()
    
    # For each point, find its reduced normal vector
    covered = set()
    for (x,y,z) in points:
        if (x,y,z) in covered:
            continue
        # Compute gcd and reduced normal vector
        g = math.gcd(math.gcd(x,y), z)
        a, b, c = x//g, y//g, z//g
        planes.add((a,b,c))
        # Mark all multiples of this direction as covered
        k = 1
        while True:
            pt = (k*a, k*b, k*c)
            if max(pt) > n:
                break
            covered.add(pt)
            k += 1
    
    return len(planes)

# Enumerate for small values of n
for n in range(2, 7):
    print(f"n={n}: {count_required_planes(n)} planes")
```
