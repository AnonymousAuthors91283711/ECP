[write_program]
This problem asks us to find a sequence defined by specific initial conditions and a recursive rule, then compute the 100th term (index 99). The sequence starts with 1, 2, 4, 6, and each subsequent term is the smallest integer greater than the previous term that cannot be expressed as the sum of any two distinct earlier terms.

We'll write a Python program to generate this sequence up to the 100th term. The approach will be:
1. Start with the initial sequence [1, 2, 4, 6]
2. For each subsequent term, find the smallest number greater than the last term that isn't a sum of any two distinct previous terms
3. Continue until we reach the 100th term

```python
def generate_omnimath_sequence(length):
    sequence = [1, 2, 4, 6]
    if length <= 4:
        return sequence[:length]
    
    for n in range(4, length):
        last = sequence[-1]
        k = last + 1
        while True:
            valid = True
            # Check all pairs of distinct previous terms
            for i in range(len(sequence)):
                for j in range(i + 1, len(sequence)):
                    if sequence[i] + sequence[j] == k:
                        valid = False
                        break
                if not valid:
                    break
            if valid:
                sequence.append(k)
                print(f"s({n}) = {k}")  # Print each new term
                break
            else:
                k += 1
    return sequence

# Generate and print the sequence up to s(99)
seq = generate_omnimath_sequence(100)
print(f"\nFinal answer: s(99) = {seq[99]}")
```
