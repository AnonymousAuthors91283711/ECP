This problem is about finding the score of a new student added to a class. Given:
- Initial class has 15 students with average 80
- After adding one new student, the average becomes 81
We need to find the new student's score.

The mathematical relationship is: (15*80 + x)/16 = 81, where x is the new student's score.

Here's a Python program that calculates this directly:

```python
# Calculate the score of the new student added to a class
initial_students = 15
initial_avg = 80
final_avg = 81

# Total score before adding new student
initial_total = initial_students * initial_avg

# Total score after adding new student
final_total = (initial_students + 1) * final_avg

# New student's score is the difference
new_student_score = final_total - initial_total

print(f"The new student's score is: {new_student_score}")
```
