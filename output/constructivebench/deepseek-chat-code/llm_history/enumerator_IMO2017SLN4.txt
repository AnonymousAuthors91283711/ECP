[write_program]
This problem is from the 2017 IMO Shortlist (N4). It asks for the greatest natural number n such that there exists a positive integer m where n equals the cardinality of the set of natural numbers t where:
1. For all k < t, (10^k - 1)/(c*m) is not an integer for any c ∈ [1,2017]
2. For t itself, (10^t - 1)/(c*m) is an integer for some c ∈ [1,2017]

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible n values by testing small m values and counting valid t values for each m.

```python
def main():
    max_c = 2017  # Parameter from problem
    max_m_to_test = 100  # Reasonable upper bound for initial search
    
    max_n = 0
    best_m = 0
    
    for m in range(1, max_m_to_test + 1):
        valid_ts = set()
        for c in range(1, max_c + 1):
            cm = c * m
            if cm == 0:
                continue
            t = 1
            while True:
                numerator = 10**t - 1
                if numerator % cm == 0:
                    # Check all k < t don't work for this c
                    valid = True
                    for k in range(1, t):
                        if (10**k - 1) % cm == 0:
                            valid = False
                            break
                    if valid:
                        valid_ts.add(t)
                    break
                t += 1
                if t > 100:  # Prevent infinite loops
                    break
        current_n = len(valid_ts)
        if current_n > max_n:
            max_n = current_n
            best_m = m
            print(f"New max n={max_n} found at m={m}")
    
    print(f"Final maximum n found: {max_n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program tests m values up to 100, and for each m, checks all c values from 1 to 2017. For each (c,m) pair, it finds the smallest t where (10^t-1) is divisible by c*m, while verifying no smaller k works. The program keeps track of the maximum n (number of distinct t values) found. The output shows progress as better solutions are found.
