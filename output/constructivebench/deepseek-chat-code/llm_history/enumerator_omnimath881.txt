[write_program]
This problem asks for the maximum possible 2-adic valuation (exponent of 2 in prime factorization) of a product of distinct positive integers that sum to 2021. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible sums of distinct integers and compute their product's 2-adic valuation.

The strategy is:
1. Generate all possible sets of distinct positive integers that sum to 2021
2. For each set, compute the product's 2-adic valuation
3. Track the maximum valuation found

Since enumerating all partitions is computationally intensive, we'll:
- Use a greedy approach to generate likely candidates
- Focus on numbers with high 2-adic valuations (powers of 2)
- Limit the search space to reasonable bounds

```python
def count_twos(n):
    """Return the exponent of 2 in prime factorization of n."""
    count = 0
    while n % 2 == 0 and n != 0:
        count += 1
        n = n // 2
    return count

    max_v = 0
    # Try sets with consecutive numbers starting from 1
    current_sum = 0
    terms = []
    for i in range(1, max_terms+1):
        if current_sum + i > target_sum:
            break
        terms.append(i)
        current_sum += i
    
    # Adjust last term to reach exact sum
    remaining = target_sum - current_sum
    if remaining > 0:
        if remaining <= terms[-1]:
            terms[-1] += remaining
        else:
            terms.append(remaining)
    
    product = 1
    for num in terms:
        product *= num

    if remaining > 0:
        if remaining not in terms:
            terms.append(remaining)
        else:
            # Adjust to maintain distinctness
            terms[-1] += remaining
