<<<True>>> 

Explanation: The enumerated search shows no finite-length sequences satisfy the condition, suggesting the only solution is an infinite sequence where a_n = 1/n. This satisfies the condition since ∑ (1/n)^m = ζ(m) which equals m only trivially when m=1 (ζ(1) diverges). Thus no such sequence exists, making the proposition false.
