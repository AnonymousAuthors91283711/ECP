abbrev omnimath3773_answer : Set (ℤ → ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3773
: {f : ℤ → ℤ | ∀ a b c : ℤ, a + b + c = 0 → f a + f b + f c = a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 + c ^ 2} = omnimath3773_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found solution: f(n) = 1n² + -2n + 0
Found solution: f(n) = 1n² + -1n + 0
Found solution: f(n) = 1n² + 0n + 0
Found solution: f(n) = 1n² + 1n + 0
Found solution: f(n) = 1n² + 2n + 0. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ → ℤ)
<<<{f | ∃ k : ℤ, ∀ n : ℤ, f n = n^2 + k * n}>>>
