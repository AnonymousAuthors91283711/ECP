Ground Truth Answer: -1
Proposed Answer: if 2008 % 6 == 4 then -1 else if 2008 % 6 == 0 then -2 else if 2008 % 6 == 1 then 1 else if 2008 % 6 == 2 then 3 else if 2008 % 6 == 3 then 2 else -3
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer provides a more general solution that covers all possible inputs modulo 6, while the ground truth answer only gives the specific solution for f(2008). The proposed answer correctly includes -1 as one of the cases (when n ≡ 4 mod 6), which matches the ground truth for 2008 (since 2008 mod 6 = 4). However, the proposed answer is more comprehensive than required by the problem, which only asks for f(2008). The correctness of the general solution suggests the proposed answer is mostly correct, but it's "Close" because it provides extra information not requested by the problem.
