Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => a * b = 0 ∧ a + b ≥ 0
Proposed Answer: fun a b : ℝ => a = 0 ∨ b = 0
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer `fun a b : ℝ => a = 0 ∨ b = 0` captures the condition `a * b = 0` from the ground truth, but misses the additional constraint `a + b ≥ 0`. The ground truth requires both that at least one of `a` or `b` is zero (equivalent to `a = 0 ∨ b = 0`) AND that their sum is non-negative. The proposed answer is correct in identifying when the square root equals the sum, but doesn't account for cases where both are negative (which would make the square root positive while the sum negative). Thus, the answers are close but not fully equivalent.
