This problem involves calculating a conditional probability based on survey responses. We need to find the probability that a student who says they dislike dancing actually likes dancing. The problem provides:
- Total students: 100
- Students who like dancing: 60
- Students who dislike dancing: 40
- Truth-telling rates: 80% for liking, 20% for disliking (among those who like dancing)
- Truth-telling rates: 90% for disliking, 10% for liking (among those who dislike dancing)

We'll enumerate the counts and compute the probability.

```python
def calculate_probability():
    total = 100
    like_dancing = 60
    dislike_dancing = 40
    
    # Students who say they like/dislike from each group
    say_like_from_like = 0.8 * like_dancing
    say_dislike_from_like = 0.2 * like_dancing
    say_dislike_from_dislike = 0.9 * dislike_dancing
    say_like_from_dislike = 0.1 * dislike_dancing
    
    # Total students who say they dislike dancing
    total_say_dislike = say_dislike_from_like + say_dislike_from_dislike
    
    # Probability that a student who says they dislike actually likes dancing
    probability = say_dislike_from_like / total_say_dislike
    
    # Print intermediate values for verification
    print(f"Students who like dancing but say dislike: {say_dislike_from_like}")
    print(f"Total students who say dislike: {total_say_dislike}")
    print(f"Probability: {probability}")

calculate_probability()
```
