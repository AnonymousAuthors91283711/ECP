abbrev omnimath3440_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3440 : 
  IsLeast {d : ℝ | ∃ x ∈ ({11/10, 111/100, 1.101, 1111/1000, 1.011} : Set ℝ), d = |x - 1|} 
          |omnimath3440_answer - 1| := by sorry. Enumerated answers: |1.1 - 1| = 0.10000000000000009
|1.11 - 1| = 0.1100000000000001
|1.101 - 1| = 0.10099999999999998
|1.111 - 1| = 0.11099999999999999
|1.011 - 1| = 0.010999999999999899

Minimum difference: 0.010999999999999899. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<1.011 - 1>>>
