This problem involves finding the sum of an infinite series. The series is defined as the sum from n=0 to infinity of 1/((n+3)^2 + (n+1)). To approach this, we'll:

1. Compute partial sums to observe convergence
2. Look for patterns or closed-form expressions
3. Verify potential candidates by comparing with partial sums

The Python program will compute partial sums up to a reasonable threshold to help identify the pattern. We'll use exact fractions (via fractions.Fraction) to avoid floating-point inaccuracies.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_partial_sums(max_n):
    partial_sum = Fraction(0, 1)
    for n in range(max_n + 1):
        denominator = (n + 3)**2 + (n + 1)
        term = Fraction(1, denominator)
        partial_sum += term
        print(f"S_{n} = {partial_sum} (approx {float(partial_sum):.6f})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Computing partial sums of sum_{n=0}^âˆž 1/((n+3)^2 + (n+1))")
    compute_partial_sums(20)
```
