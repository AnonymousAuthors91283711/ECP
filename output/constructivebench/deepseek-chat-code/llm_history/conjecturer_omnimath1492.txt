open Nat Int

abbrev omnimath1492_answer : Set (ℤ × ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath1492 (n m : ℤ) :
    (2^(3^n.natAbs) = 3^(2^m.natAbs) - 1) ↔ (n, m) ∈ omnimath1492_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for solutions with |n| <= 5, |m| <= 5
Found solution: (n, m) = (-1, -1)
Found solution: (n, m) = (-1, 1)
Found solution: (n, m) = (1, -1)
Found solution: (n, m) = (1, 1). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ)
<<<{(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)}>>>
