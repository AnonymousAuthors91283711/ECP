This problem involves finding which day of the week (represented as 0=Sunday through 6=Saturday) appears exactly 5 times in August when July starts on Sunday (0), Friday (5), or Saturday (6). The key insight is that August has 31 days, and 31 â‰¡ 3 mod 7, so the day counts will be 5 for some days and 4 for others.

We'll enumerate all possible starting days for August (based on July starts) and count the occurrences of each weekday in August to find which one appears exactly 5 times.

```python
def count_days(start_july):
    start_august = (start_july + 31) % 7
    august_days = [(start_august + day) % 7 for day in range(31)]
    counts = [0] * 7
    for day in august_days:
        counts[day] += 1
    return counts

def main():
    for start_july in [0, 5, 6]:
        print(f"July starts on day {start_july}:")
        counts = count_days(start_july)
        for day in range(7):
            if counts[day] == 5:
                print(f"  Day {day} appears 5 times in August")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
