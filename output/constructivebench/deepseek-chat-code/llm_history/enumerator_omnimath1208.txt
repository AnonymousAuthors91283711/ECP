The problem asks for the count of numbers `n` between 1 and 2002 (inclusive) where the number of 1's in the binary representation of `n` equals the number of 1's in the binary representation of `n+1`. 

To solve this, we'll:
1. Iterate through numbers from 1 to 2002
2. For each number, calculate its binary representation and count the 1's
3. Do the same for n+1
4. Count how many numbers satisfy the equality condition

The program will output each matching number as it finds them, then finally print the total count.

```python
def count_ones_in_binary(n):
    return bin(n).count('1')

def find_matching_numbers(max_n):
    count = 0
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        ones_n = count_ones_in_binary(n)
        ones_n_plus_1 = count_ones_in_binary(n + 1)
        if ones_n == ones_n_plus_1:
            print(n)  # Stream partial results
            count += 1
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

# Set parameters and run
max_n = 2002
print(f"Checking numbers from 1 to {max_n}")
find_matching_numbers(max_n)
```
