[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer A such that:
1. A has an odd number of digits
2. There exists a number B formed by removing one digit from A (keeping order)
3. Both A and B are divisible by 2018

We'll write a Python program to find the smallest such A by:
1. Generating multiples of 2018
2. Checking if they have odd digit length
3. For each candidate A, checking all possible B's formed by removing one digit
4. Verifying if any B is also divisible by 2018

```python
def digits(n):
    return list(map(int, str(n)))

def remove_one_digit(n):
    s = str(n)
    return [int(s[:i] + s[i+1:]) for i in range(len(s))]

def find_min_A():
    n = 2018
    while True:
        A = n
        d = digits(A)
        if len(d) % 2 == 1:  # odd number of digits
            for B in remove_one_digit(A):
                if B % 2018 == 0 and B > 0:
                    print(f"Found candidate A: {A}, B: {B}")
                    return A
        n += 2018

if __name__ == "__main__":
    min_A = find_min_A()
    print(f"Minimum A is: {min_A}")
```
