[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number greater than 2023 whose digit sum equals 17. We'll write a Python program to find this number by checking numbers sequentially starting from 2024 until we find one with the required digit sum.

The approach:
1. Start checking from 2024 upwards
2. For each number, calculate the sum of its digits
3. Return the first number where the digit sum equals 17

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

n = 2024
while True:
    if digit_sum(n) == 17:
        print(n)
        break
    n += 1
```
