[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimum number of blue cells in a grid of size (4m)Ã—(4m) such that every cell is related to at least 2 blue cells (where related means sharing a row or column). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values for small m.

The approach:
1. For m=1 (4x4 grid), enumerate all possible configurations
2. Count blue cells and verify the condition
3. Find the minimal k satisfying the condition

```python
from itertools import product, combinations

def solve_for_m(m):
    n = 4 * m
    grid = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(n)]
    min_k = None
    
    # Try increasing k values until we find the minimal solution
    for k in range(2 * n, n * n + 1):
        # Try all combinations of k blue cells
        for blue_cells in combinations(grid, k):
            satisfies = True
            for cell in grid:
                # Count blue cells in same row or column
                count = 0
                for b in blue_cells:
                    if (b[0] == cell[0] or b[1] == cell[1]) and b != cell:
                        count += 1
                        if count >= 2:
                            break
                if count < 2:
                    satisfies = False
                    break
            if satisfies:
                print(f"For m={m}, found solution with k={k}")
                if min_k is None or k < min_k:
                    min_k = k
                # No need to check larger k for this m
                return min_k
    return min_k

# Solve for small m values
for m in [1, 2]:
    result = solve_for_m(m)
    if result is not None:
        print(f"Minimal k for m={m}: {result}")
    else:
        print(f"No solution found for m={m}")
```
