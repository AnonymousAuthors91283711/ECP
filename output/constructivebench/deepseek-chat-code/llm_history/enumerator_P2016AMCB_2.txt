The problem asks for the natural number n that minimizes the absolute difference between n and the harmonic mean of 1 and 2016 (which is (2*1*2016)/(1+2016)). We need to find the integer closest to this value.

We'll compute the exact value of the harmonic mean and find the nearest integer. Since 2016 is fixed, we can compute this directly.

```python
def harmonic_mean(a, b):
    return (2 * a * b) / (a + b)

# Compute harmonic mean of 1 and 2016
hm = harmonic_mean(1, 2016)

# Find nearest integer
n = round(hm)

# Print the harmonic mean and nearest integer
print(f"Harmonic mean: {hm}")
print(f"Nearest integer: {n}")
```
