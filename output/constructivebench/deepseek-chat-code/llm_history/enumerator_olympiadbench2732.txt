This problem involves finding the value of `c` given certain conditions on `r` and `s`. The conditions are:
1. `r` and `s` are roots of a quadratic equation with sum `-b` and product `93`
2. `r+1` and `s+1` are roots of another quadratic equation with sum `22` and product `c`

We can solve this by:
1. Using the sum condition `(r+1)+(s+1)=22` to find `r+s=20`
2. From the first condition `r+s=-b`, we get `b=-20`
3. We already know `r*s=93` from the first condition
4. Now compute `c = (r+1)(s+1) = r*s + r + s + 1 = 93 + 20 + 1 = 114`

Here's a Python program that verifies this calculation:

```python
# Given conditions:
# r + s = 20 (from (r+1)+(s+1)=22)
# r * s = 93
# Compute c = (r+1)(s+1) = rs + r + s + 1

r_plus_s = 20
r_times_s = 93
c = r_times_s + r_plus_s + 1

print(f"Calculated value of c: {c}")
```
