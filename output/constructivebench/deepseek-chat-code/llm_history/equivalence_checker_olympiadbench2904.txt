  olympiadbench2904_answer (A, B) = 3750 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun (A, B) => (15 * (1800 / 20) * (1/B) / (1/A))
Proposed Answer: fun (A, B) => 1 / (A * B * (A + B))
Let's analyze both answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer: 
   - When A=1/9 and B=1/25, it becomes: 15 * (1800/20) * 25 / 9 = 15 * 90 * 25 / 9 = 3750
   - This matches the theorem's requirement

2. Proposed Answer:
   - When A=1/9 and B=1/25, it becomes: 1 / ((1/9)*(1/25)*(1/9 + 1/25)) = 1 / ((1/225)*(34/225)) = 225*225/34 ≈ 1489.0
   - This does not equal 3750

The proposed answer gives a completely different result from the ground truth answer. They are not equivalent.
