This problem involves a recursive sequence defined with initial conditions and a recurrence relation. We need to find the smallest n where xₙ ≤ 10⁻⁶. The solution requires computing the sequence values until we find the first term satisfying the condition.

Here's a Python program that computes the sequence values and checks when they first drop below the threshold:

```python
def main():
    threshold = 1e-6
    # Initialize the sequence with given values
    x = [0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2/3]  # x[0] unused, indices 1-3 set
    
    n = 3  # last computed index
    while True:
        n += 1
        # Compute next term using recurrence relation
        numerator = x[n-1]**2 * x[n-2]
        denominator = 2 * x[n-2]**2 - x[n-1] * x[n-3]
        next_term = numerator / denominator
        x.append(next_term)
        
        print(f"x[{n}] = {next_term}")
        
        if next_term <= threshold:
            print(f"First n where x_n ≤ {threshold}: {n}")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program:
1. Initializes the sequence with given values x₁=1, x₂=1, x₃=2/3
2. Computes subsequent terms using the recurrence relation
3. Prints each computed term
4. Stops when a term ≤ 10⁻⁶ is found and prints the index
5. Uses floating-point arithmetic for efficiency (exact rational arithmetic would be more precise but slower)

The output will show the sequence values and identify the smallest n where the condition is met.
