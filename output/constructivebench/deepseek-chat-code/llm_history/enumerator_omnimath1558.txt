This problem involves finding the maximum value of x in a system where we have an arithmetic sequence (aₙ) and a geometric sequence (bₙ) with specific product conditions. We'll enumerate possible values by solving the system of equations for small integer parameters.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, simplify

def find_max_x():
    max_x = None
    # Try small integer values for a1 and d to find patterns
    for a1 in range(-10, 11):
        for d in range(-10, 11):
            if a1 == 0 or d == 0:
                continue  # avoid division by zero
            # Solve for b1 and r from the first two equations
            b1 = 20 / a1
            # Second equation: (a1 + d)*(b1*r) = 19
            r = 19 / ((a1 + d) * b1)
            # Verify third equation: (a1 + 2d)*(b1*r^2) = 14
            lhs = (a1 + 2*d) * b1 * r**2
            if abs(lhs - 14) < 1e-6:  # floating point tolerance
                # Calculate x from fourth equation
                x = (a1 + 3*d) * b1 * r**3
                print(f"a1={a1}, d={d}, b1={b1:.2f}, r={r:.2f}, x={x:.2f}")
                if max_x is None or x > max_x:
                    max_x = x
    if max_x is not None:
        print(f"\nMaximum x found: {max_x:.2f}")

find_max_x()
```
