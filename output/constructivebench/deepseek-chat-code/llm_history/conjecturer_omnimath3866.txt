Based on the error message and the enumerated answers, I notice that:
1. The proposed answer `2/x` doesn't match the found constant solution `f(x) = 2.0`
2. The error suggests making the function noncomputable due to Real division
3. The functional equation suggests a constant solution is possible when substituting x=y=1 gives f(1)*f(1)=2f(1+f(1)), which holds for f(1)=2

The constant function f(x) = 2 satisfies the given condition:
For any x,y>0: f(x)*f(y) = 2*2 = 4 = 2*f(x + y*2) = 2*2 = 4

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<fun _ : ℝ => 2>>> 

This is a constant function that returns 2 for any real input, which matches the enumerated solution and satisfies the functional equation. The noncomputable issue is avoided since we don't need division.
