This problem involves finding the smallest natural number n such that the number of distinct products of (d_i + 1) for all functions d:Fin n â†’ Fin 6 is exactly 936. We'll approach this by:

1. Modeling all possible functions from Fin n to Fin 6 (each d_i can be 0-5)
2. Calculating the product (d_i + 1) for each function
3. Counting distinct products until we reach 936 distinct values
4. Finding the minimal n where this count equals 936

We'll implement this by:
- Generating all multisets of exponents (since product is commutative)
- Calculating the product for each multiset
- Counting distinct products

```python
from math import prod
from collections import defaultdict

def count_distinct_products(n):
    # We'll use dynamic programming to count distinct products
    # dp[i][p] = number of ways to get product p with first i positions
    dp = defaultdict(int)
    dp[1] = 1  # initial product
    
    for _ in range(n):
        new_dp = defaultdict(int)
        for p in dp:
            for d in range(6):  # Fin 6 has values 0-5
                new_p = p * (d + 1)
                new_dp[new_p] += dp[p]
        dp = new_dp
    
    return len(dp)

def find_min_n(target=936):
    n = 1
    while True:
        count = count_distinct_products(n)
        print(f"n={n}, distinct products={count}")
        if count >= target:
            break
        n += 1
    # Verify if we hit exactly the target
    if count == target:
        print(f"Minimal n where count equals {target} is {n}")
    else:
        print(f"Reached {count} products at n={n}, but didn't hit target {target}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_n()
```
