The problem asks for the smallest number greater than 72 that has exactly the same prime factors as 72. Since 72 = 2^3 * 3^2, we need to find numbers >72 whose prime factors are only 2 and 3. We'll enumerate numbers of the form 2^a * 3^b where a,b â‰¥ 1, sorted by value, and find the first one >72.

```python
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = set()
    if n % 2 == 0:
        factors.add(2)
        while n % 2 == 0:
            n //= 2
    i = 3
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            factors.add(i)
            while n % i == 0:
                n //= i
        i += 2
    if n > 2:
        factors.add(n)
    return factors

target_factors = {2, 3}
min_n = None

# Generate numbers of form 2^a * 3^b in order
a = 0
while True:
    a += 1
    b = 0
    while True:
        b += 1
        n = (2 ** a) * (3 ** b)
        if n > 72:
            if prime_factors(n) == target_factors:
                print(f"Candidate found: {n}")
                if min_n is None or n < min_n:
                    min_n = n
        if n > 200:  # Safe upper bound since 2^6*3^2=576, 2^3*3^3=216, etc.
            break
    if 2 ** a > 200:
        break

print(f"\nThe smallest number >72 with same prime factors as 72 is: {min_n}")
```
