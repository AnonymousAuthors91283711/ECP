[write_program]
This problem involves finding the minimal positive value of a₂ in a recursive sequence defined by a₀=0, a₁=1, and a recurrence relation. The sequence must satisfy certain conditions and cannot be extended beyond a₉. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of a₂ and compute the sequence to find the minimal valid a₂.

The approach:
1. Start with small positive values for a₂
2. Compute the sequence up to a₉ using the recurrence relation
3. Check if the sequence cannot be extended to a₁₀
4. Find the minimal a₂ that satisfies all conditions

```python
def compute_sequence(a2, max_n=10):
    """Compute the sequence up to a9 given a2, return None if invalid"""
    a = [0.0, 1.0, a2]
    for n in range(8):  # Compute up to a10 (index 10)
        # Recurrence relation: a_{n+2} = (a_n + a_{n+1})/(a_n * a_{n+1} - 1)
        if n + 2 > 9:  # We only need up to a9 to check extendability
            break
        denominator = a[n] * a[n+1] - 1
        if abs(denominator) < 1e-10:  # Prevent division by zero
            return None
        next_term = (a[n] + a[n+1]) / denominator
        a.append(next_term)
    return a

def is_valid(a2):
    """Check if a2 leads to a sequence that can't be extended to a10"""
    a = compute_sequence(a2)
    if a is None or len(a) < 10:
        return False
    # Check if a10 would be undefined (denominator zero)
    denominator = a[8] * a[9] - 1
    return abs(denominator) < 1e-10

def find_min_a2():
    """Find minimal positive a2 that satisfies the conditions"""
    min_valid = None
    # Search in small steps (can be refined near the solution)
    for a2 in [x * 0.0001 for x in range(1, 100000)]:
        if is_valid(a2):
            if min_valid is None or a2 < min_valid:
                min_valid = a2
                print(f"Found candidate: {a2}")
    if min_valid is not None:
        print(f"Minimal valid a2: {min_valid}")
    else:
        print("No valid a2 found in search range")

find_min_a2()
```
