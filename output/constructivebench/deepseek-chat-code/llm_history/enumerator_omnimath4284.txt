This problem asks for a function f from Fin 8 to positive natural numbers where divisibility conditions between f(i) and f(j) correspond exactly to specific pairs of indices (i,j). We'll enumerate possible functions f that satisfy these conditions for small values.

The approach is to:
1. Model the required divisibility graph
2. Try assigning small prime powers to each vertex
3. Check if the assignments satisfy the divisibility conditions

```python
from itertools import product

def main():
    # The required divisibility pairs (undirected)
    required_pairs = [
        (0,1), (0,2), (0,4),
        (1,3), (1,5),
        (2,3), (2,6),
        (3,7),
        (4,5), (4,6),
        (5,7),
        (6,7)
    ]
    
    # All possible pairs (for checking)
    all_pairs = [(i,j) for i in range(8) for j in range(i+1,8)]
    
    # Try small prime powers for each position
    primes = [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]
    max_exp = 3
    
    # Generate possible exponents for each position
    for exponents in product(range(1, max_exp+1), repeat=8):
        f = [primes[i]**exponents[i] for i in range(8)]
        valid = True
        
        # Check all pairs
        for i,j in all_pairs:
            divisible = (f[i] % f[j] == 0) or (f[j] % f[i] == 0)
            required = (i,j) in required_pairs or (j,i) in required_pairs
            
            if divisible != required:
                valid = False
                break
        
        if valid:
            print("Valid assignment found:")
            print(f)
            return
    
    print("No valid assignment found with current parameters")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
