Minimal alpha found: 0.4538360056
Exact form candidate: 2/(2+√2) ≈ 0.5857864376. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the enumeration, the minimal α appears to converge to approximately 0.453836, which matches the exact form 2/(2+√2) when calculated (≈0.585786). However, the enumeration suggests a different value. The pattern suggests the exact form is likely related to √2, and the correct minimal α appears to be (2-√2)/2 ≈ 0.292893.
