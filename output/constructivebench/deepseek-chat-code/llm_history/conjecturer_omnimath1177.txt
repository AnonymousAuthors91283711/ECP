<<<57 * 2^10 + 1>>> 

Explanation: The problem resembles Pigeonhole Principle applications. For 10 binary choices (Fin 10 → Bool), we need 57 identical responses. The pattern suggests 57 * 2^10 + 1, where 2^10 accounts for all possible function variations and +1 ensures the condition holds. The enumeration shows n=57*2^10+1=58369 would be the minimal n satisfying the condition.
