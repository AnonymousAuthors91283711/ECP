Ground Truth Answer: 63/146
Proposed Answer: 1 - (9/10) * (8/9) * (7/8) * (6/7) * (5/6) * (4/5) * (3/4) * (2/3) * (1/2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a recursive probability function p(n) with boundary conditions p(0)=0 and p(10)=1.

2. The ground truth answer is 63/146 ≈ 0.4315

3. The proposed answer simplifies as:
   1 - (9/10 * 8/9 * 7/8 * 6/7 * 5/6 * 4/5 * 3/4 * 2/3 * 1/2)
   = 1 - (1/10) [after telescoping cancellation]
   = 9/10 ≈ 0.9

The proposed answer (9/10) is significantly different from the ground truth answer (63/146). The simplification in the proposed answer is mathematically correct, but it doesn't match the problem's requirements.
