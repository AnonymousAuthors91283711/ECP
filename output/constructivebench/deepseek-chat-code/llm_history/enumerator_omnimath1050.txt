The problem asks to find the remainder when a polynomial P (with given evaluations at x=1,2,3) is divided by (X^3 - 6X^2 + 11X - 6). We'll solve this by constructing the remainder polynomial R(x) = ax² + bx + c that satisfies R(1)=-4, R(2)=-1, R(3)=4.

```python
# Find coefficients a,b,c for quadratic remainder R(x) = ax² + bx + c
# satisfying R(1)=-4, R(2)=-1, R(3)=4

# System of equations:
# a + b + c = -4
# 4a + 2b + c = -1
# 9a + 3b + c = 4

# Solving the system:
print("Solving system:")
print("1a + 1b + 1c = -4")
print("4a + 2b + 1c = -1")
print("9a + 3b + 1c = 4")

# Subtract first equation from others:
print("\nAfter subtraction:")
print("3a + b = 3")   # (2nd - 1st)
print("8a + 2b = 8")  # (3rd - 1st)

# Simplify second new equation:
print("4a + b = 4")   # (divided by 2)

# Subtract equations again:
print("\na = 1")       # (4a+b=4 minus 3a+b=3)
print("Then b = 0")    # from 3a+b=3
print("Then c = -5")   # from a+b+c=-4

print("\nRemainder polynomial coefficients:")
print("a = 1, b = 0, c = -5")
print("Final remainder: x² - 5")
```
