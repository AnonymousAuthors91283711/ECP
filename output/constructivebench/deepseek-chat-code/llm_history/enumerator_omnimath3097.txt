This problem involves solving a simple rational equation to find the value of 'a' that makes the equation true. The equation is (3a - 7)/(a - 2) = 2. We'll solve it algebraically and verify the solution.

The approach is:
1. Cross-multiply to eliminate the denominator
2. Solve the resulting linear equation
3. Verify the solution doesn't make the denominator zero

```python
def solve_equation():
    # The equation is (3a - 7)/(a - 2) = 2
    # Cross multiply: 3a - 7 = 2(a - 2)
    # Expand: 3a - 7 = 2a - 4
    # Subtract 2a: a - 7 = -4
    # Add 7: a = 3
    
    # Verification: (3*3 - 7)/(3 - 2) = (9-7)/1 = 2
    a = 3
    print(f"The solution is a = {a}")
