[write_program]
This problem involves finding natural numbers n ≥ 3 for which there exists a real-valued sequence a satisfying certain recurrence and boundary conditions. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible n values that satisfy these conditions by simulating the recurrence relation.

The key conditions are:
1. Periodic boundary conditions: aₙ = a₀ and a_{n+1} = a₁
2. Recurrence relation: a_{i+2} = a_i * a_{i+1} + 1 for 0 ≤ i < n

We'll test small values of n (3 ≤ n ≤ 20) and check if consistent values of a₀ and a₁ exist that satisfy all conditions.

```python
def check_sequence(n):
    # We'll solve for a0 and a1 that satisfy the boundary conditions
    # The recurrence relation is quadratic, so we'll use numerical approximation
    from math import isclose
    
    # Function to compute the sequence given a0 and a1
    def compute_sequence(a0, a1):
        seq = [a0, a1]
        for i in range(2, n+2):
            next_val = seq[i-2] * seq[i-1] + 1
            seq.append(next_val)
        return seq
    
    # We need to find a0,a1 such that seq[n] == a0 and seq[n+1] == a1
    # We'll use a grid search for small n
    
    # Try different initial values
    for a0 in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
        for a1 in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
            seq = compute_sequence(a0, a1)
            if isclose(seq[n], a0, abs_tol=1e-6) and isclose(seq[n+1], a1, abs_tol=1e-6):
                return True
    return False

def main():
    print("Checking values of n where the sequence conditions hold:")
    for n in range(3, 21):
        if check_sequence(n):
            print(f"n = {n} satisfies the conditions")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
