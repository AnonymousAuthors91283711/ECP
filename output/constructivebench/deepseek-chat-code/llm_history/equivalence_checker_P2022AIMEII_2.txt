Ground Truth Answer: 125
Proposed Answer: 96
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating a probability expression with three cases (case1, case2, case3) that are averaged together.

2. Calculating each case:
   - case1 = (2/3)*(9/16) + (1/3)*(3/16) = 6/16 + 1/16 = 7/16
   - case2 = (9/16)*(2/3) + (3/16)*(3/4) = 6/16 + 9/64 = 24/64 + 9/64 = 33/64
   - case3 is identical to case2 = 33/64

3. The average is (7/16 + 33/64 + 33/64)/3 = (28/64 + 33/64 + 33/64)/3 = (94/64)/3 = 94/192 = 47/96

4. The simplified form is 47/96, so q=96

The ground truth answer is 125, but the correct denominator from the calculation is 96. The proposed answer matches our calculation.
