Ground Truth Answer: 37/4
Proposed Answer: 9.25
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer (37/4) and the proposed answer (9.25):

1. Mathematical calculation:
   37/4 = 9.25 exactly

2. Representation:
   - 37/4 is an exact fractional representation
   - 9.25 is the decimal equivalent

3. Context:
   - The problem is about finding a real number solution
   - Both forms represent the same real number value
   - No constraints are violated by using decimal form

Since both answers represent exactly the same numerical value, just in different forms, they are equivalent.
