[write_program]
The problem is to find the value of x - y given the equations 2 = 0.1x and 2 = 0.2y. We can solve for x and y directly from these equations and compute their difference. The Python program will calculate this difference exactly.

```python
# Calculate x and y from the equations 2 = 0.1x and 2 = 0.2y, then compute x - y
x = 2 / 0.1
y = 2 / 0.2
result = x - y
print(result)
```
