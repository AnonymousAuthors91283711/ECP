Ground Truth Answer: 2005
Proposed Answer: 2005 - 1 + 1
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer "2005 - 1 + 1" simplifies to 2005, which is exactly the same as the ground truth answer. The expression is mathematically equivalent, just written in a more convoluted way. Both answers correctly represent the solution to the problem.
