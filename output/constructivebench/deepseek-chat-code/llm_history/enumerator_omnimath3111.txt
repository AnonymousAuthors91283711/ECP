The problem involves finding two distinct real numbers y₁ and y₂ that satisfy a system of equations, where the sum of their negatives equals some answer. We need to enumerate possible values of y that satisfy the given conditions.

Approach:
1. The conditions are:
   - x + y = 7
   - x * z = -180
   - (x + y + z)² = 4
2. From x + y = 7, we can express x = 7 - y
3. Substitute into the third equation: (7 + z)² = 4 ⇒ z = -7 ± 2 ⇒ z ∈ {-9, -5}
4. For each z value, use x * z = -180 to find x, then y = 7 - x
5. Collect all distinct y values and compute -(y₁ + y₂)

```python
def solve():
    # Possible z values from (7 + z)^2 = 4
    z_values = [-9, -5]
    
    y_values = set()
    
    for z in z_values:
        # x = -180 / z
        x = -180 / z
        y = 7 - x
        y_values.add(y)
    
    # Convert to sorted list for consistent output
    y_list = sorted(y_values)
    
    # Print each solution
    for y in y_list:
        print(f"Found y = {y}")
    
    # Compute and print the final answer
    answer = -(y_list[0] + y_list[1])
    print(f"Final answer: {answer}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```
