Minimal exponent for 7^7: 16807. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to find the minimal positive integer n such that (3^3 * 5^5 * 7^7) divides (149^n - 2^n). The error occurs because Lean needs disambiguation between different lcm implementations.

The solution involves finding the least common multiple of:
1. The minimal exponent for 3^3 (which is 9)
2. The minimal exponent for 5^5 (which is 500 since 5^4 is insufficient)
3. The minimal exponent for 7^7 (which is 16807)

The correct answer should be the LCM of these three numbers. Here's the fixed version:

<<<Nat.lcm 9 (Nat.lcm 500 (7^6))>>>

Explanation:
1. For 3^3, the minimal exponent is 9 (since 149 ≡ 2 mod 3 and ord₃(2) = 2, so we need 3^(3-1)*3 = 9)
2. For 5^5, 149 ≡ 4 mod 5 and ord₅(4) = 2, so we need 5^(5-1)*4 = 500
3. For 7^7, 149 ≡ 2 mod 7 and ord₇(2) = 3, so we need 7^(7-1)*3 = 16807 (which is 7^6)

The LCM of these gives the minimal n satisfying all conditions. The error was fixed by explicitly using Nat.lcm instead of the ambiguous lcm.
