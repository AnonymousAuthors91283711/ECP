[write_program]
This problem involves finding the smallest natural number n for which the sum S(n) of the sequence t(i) from i=1 to n becomes negative. The sequence t(n) is defined as 555 - 7n. We'll write a Python program to enumerate the sums S(n) and find the smallest n where S(n) < 0.

The approach is:
1. Compute t(n) = 555 - 7n for each n
2. Compute the cumulative sum S(n) by adding t(i) from i=1 to n
3. Find the smallest n where S(n) becomes negative

```python
def find_min_n():
    n = 1
    cumulative_sum = 0
    while True:
        t_n = 555 - 7 * n
        cumulative_sum += t_n
        print(f"n={n}, S(n)={cumulative_sum}")  # Stream partial results
        if cumulative_sum < 0:
            print(f"Smallest n where S(n) < 0: {n}")  # Output the extremal answer
            return
        n += 1

find_min_n()
```
