This problem involves calculating the combined average of two sets of numbers when given their individual averages. The first set has 20 numbers with average 30, and the second has 30 numbers with average 20. We need to find the combined average of all 50 numbers.

The solution can be derived mathematically by calculating the weighted average:
- Total sum of first set = 20 * 30 = 600
- Total sum of second set = 30 * 20 = 600
- Combined sum = 600 + 600 = 1200
- Combined average = 1200 / 50 = 24

Here's a Python program that verifies this calculation:

```python
def calculate_combined_average():
    # Given parameters
    n1 = 20
    avg1 = 30
    n2 = 30
    avg2 = 20
    
    # Calculate total sums
    sum1 = n1 * avg1
    sum2 = n2 * avg2
    
    # Calculate combined average
    combined_avg = (sum1 + sum2) / (n1 + n2)
    
    # Print the result
    print(f"Combined average of {n1} numbers with average {avg1}")
    print(f"and {n2} numbers with average {avg2}:")
    print(combined_avg)

# Execute the calculation
calculate_combined_average()
```
