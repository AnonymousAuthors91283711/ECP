Final maximum for n=5: 95. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated answers, we can see the maximum values for n=1 to n=5 are:
1, 7, 22, 50, 95

Looking at the pattern, these numbers match the formula for the sum of squares of the first n odd numbers:
1² = 1
1² + 3² = 1 + 9 = 10 (but we have 7)
Wait, no - that doesn't match.

Alternative approach: The numbers seem to fit the formula for the sum of the first n terms of 4n² - 1:
For n=1: 4(1)² - 1 = 3 (but we have 1)
No, that doesn't match.

Looking more carefully:
The differences between consecutive terms:
7-1=6
22-7=15
50-22=28
95-50=45

These differences (6,15,28,45) seem to follow the pattern 3n(n+1) - 2n:
For n=2: 3*2*3 - 4 = 14 (but we have 15)
Not matching.

Alternative pattern: The maximum values appear to be (4n³ - n)/3:
For n=1: (4-1)/3=1 ✓
For n=2: (32-2)/3=10 (but we have 7)
No.

Looking back at the original proposed answer:
(n*(2n+1)*(2n-1)-1)/3
For n=1: (1*3*1-1)/3=2/3 (but we need 1)
Not matching.

After careful analysis, the correct pattern appears to be:
For n=1: 1 = 1
For n=2: 7 = 1 + 6
For n=3: 22 = 1 + 6 + 15
For n=4: 50 = 1 + 6 + 15 + 28
For n=5: 95 = 1 + 6 + 15 + 28 + 45

The sequence 1,6,15,28,45,... follows the pattern (2k-1)(2k+1) for k=1,2,3,...

Therefore, the sum is Σ_{k=1}^n (2k-1)(2k+1) = Σ(4k²-1) = 4Σk² - Σ1 = 4n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 - n = (4n³ + 6n² + 2n)/6 - n = (2n³ + 3n² + n)/3 - n = (2n³ + 3n² - 2n)/3 = n(2n² + 3n - 2)/3

This matches the enumerated values:
For n=1: 1(2+3-2)/3=1
For n=2: 2(8+6-2)/3=2*12/3=8 (but we have 7)
Hmm, not perfect.

Alternative approach: The maximum seems to occur when a contains the largest possible odd numbers. For n=2: {1,3} gives 1*3 + 3*1 + min(1,3) + min(3,1) = 3+3+1+1=8 (but enumerated shows 7). Maybe I'm missing something.

Given the complexity, I'll propose the formula that matches the enumerated values exactly:

<<<fun n : ℕ => (4 * n^3 + 3 * n^2 - n) / 6>>>

This matches:
n=1: (4+3-1)/6=1
n=2: (32+12-2)/6=42/6=7
n=3: (108+27-3)/6=132/6=22
n=4: (256+48-4)/6=300/6=50
n=5: (500+75-5)/6=570/6=95[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Final maximum for n=5: 95. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated answers, we can see the maximum values for n=1 to n=5 are:
1, 7, 22, 50, 95

Looking at the pattern, these numbers match the formula for the sum of squares of the first n odd numbers:
1² = 1
1² + 3² = 1 + 9 = 10 (doesn't match)
Wait, no.

Looking at differences:
7-1=6
22-7=15
50-22=28
95-50=45

The differences are increasing by 9,13,17 (which themselves increase by 4)

This suggests a cubic relationship. The proposed formula (4n³ + 3n² - n)/6 gives:
For n=1: (4+3-1)/6=1
For n=2: (32+12-2)/6=42/6=7
For n=3: (108+27-3)/6=132/6=22
For n=4: (256+48-4)/6=300/6=50
For n=5: (500+75-5)/6=570/6=95

This matches perfectly with the enumerated answers. The error in Lean was that the function was returning a function type (ℕ → ℕ) when it should return a concrete ℕ value since the problem is specifically for n=20 (Fin 20 → ℤ).

Here's the fixed answer for n=20 case:

<<<(4 * 20^3 + 3 * 20^2 - 20) / 6>>>

Explanation:
The formula (4n³ + 3n² - n)/6 perfectly matches the enumerated maximum values for n=1 to 5. For n=20, this gives (4*8000 + 3*400 - 20)/6 = (32000 + 1200 - 20)/6 = 33180/6 = 5530. The original error occurred because the answer was defined as a function when it should be a concrete value for the specific problem instance.
