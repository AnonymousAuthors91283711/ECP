This problem involves computing a simple arithmetic expression with fractions. The task is to calculate 1 - (1/3 + 1/6 + 1/4). We'll compute this exactly using Python's fractions module to avoid floating-point approximations.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_expression():
    # Compute each term as exact fractions
    term1 = Fraction(1, 3)
    term2 = Fraction(1, 6)
    term3 = Fraction(1, 4)
    
    # Compute the sum inside parentheses
    sum_terms = term1 + term2 + term3
    
    # Compute the final expression
    result = 1 - sum_terms
    
    # Print the exact fractional result
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_expression()
```
