Ground Truth Answer: fun a b c => ((b + c)/2, (a + c)/2, (a + b)/2)
Proposed Answer: fun a b c => (a, b, c)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem states a system of two equations that must be satisfied for positive real numbers a,b,c,x,y,z.

2. The ground truth answer suggests that the solution is symmetric averages of the pairs (b+c)/2, (a+c)/2, (a+b)/2.

3. The proposed answer simply returns (a,b,c) as the solution.

Testing the proposed answer:
If we substitute x=a, y=b, z=c into the first equation: a+b+c = a+b+c which holds.
For the second equation: 4abc = a²a + b²b + c²c + abc → 4abc = a³+b³+c³+abc → 3abc = a³+b³+c³ which is not generally true for arbitrary positive a,b,c.

Therefore, the proposed answer does not satisfy the given conditions in general, while the ground truth answer does (as can be verified by substitution).
