This problem is about finding the maximum number of handshakes possible in a group of 30 people where:
- 20 people are "huggers" who only hug and don't shake hands
- 10 people are "handshakers" who shake hands with each other and with huggers
- No one is both a hugger and handshaker

The number of handshakes is given by the formula: C(m,2) + m*k, where m is number of handshakers and k is number of huggers. We need to find the maximum possible value of this expression given n=30 total people.

The Python program will enumerate all possible valid combinations of m and k (where m + k â‰¤ 30) and compute the handshake count, then find the maximum.

```python
def main():
    max_handshakes = 0
    n = 30
    
    # Iterate through all possible handshaker counts (m)
    for m in range(1, n+1):
        # Maximum huggers is n - m
        k = n - m
        handshakes = (m * (m - 1)) // 2 + m * k
        
        # Print current combination and its handshake count
        print(f"m={m}, k={k}, handshakes={handshakes}")
        
        # Update maximum if current is larger
        if handshakes > max_handshakes:
            max_handshakes = handshakes
    
    # After checking all combinations, output the maximum
    print(f"\nMaximum handshakes: {max_handshakes}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
