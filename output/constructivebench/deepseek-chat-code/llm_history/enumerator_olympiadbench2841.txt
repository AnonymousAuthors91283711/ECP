[write_program]
This problem involves finding the value of `a` given two quadratic equations that define the same set of solutions. We'll approach it by:
1. Setting T=20 as given
2. Equating the coefficients of corresponding terms in both equations
3. Solving the resulting system of equations for a and b
4. Finding the value of a that satisfies all conditions

The Python program will:
1. Symbolically represent the equations
2. Extract and equate coefficients
3. Solve the system of equations
4. Output the solution for a

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def solve_problem():
    # Define variables
    x, a, b = symbols('x a b')
    T = 20
    
    # Original equations
    eq1 = x**2 + (5*b - T - a)*x - (T + 1)
    eq2 = 2*x**2 + (T + 8*a - 2)*x + 10*b
    
    # For the solution sets to be equal, the equations must be proportional
    # So we find k such that eq1 = k * eq2
    k = symbols('k')
    
    # Equate coefficients
    coeff_eqs = [
        Eq(1, 2*k),            # x^2 coefficient
        Eq(5*b - T - a, (T + 8*a - 2)*k),  # x coefficient
        Eq(-(T + 1), 10*b*k)   # constant term
    ]
    
    # Solve the system
    solutions = solve(coeff_eqs, (a, b, k))
    
    # Filter real solutions and extract a values
    a_values = [sol[0] for sol in solutions if sol[2].is_real]
    
    # Print all possible a values
    for a_val in a_values:
        print(f"Possible solution: a = {a_val}")
    
    # Since we expect a unique solution, print the first one
    if a_values:
        print("\nFinal solution:")
        print(f"a = {a_values[0]}")
