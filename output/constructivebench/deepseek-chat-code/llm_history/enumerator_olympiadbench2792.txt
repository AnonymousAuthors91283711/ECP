[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n where the floor of n^(1/k) is distinct for all k from 1 to 8. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal n by checking each integer in order until we find one that satisfies the condition.

The approach:
1. For each candidate n starting from 1 upwards
2. For each n, compute floor(n^(1/k)) for k=1..8
3. Check if all these floor values are distinct
4. The first n that satisfies this is our answer

```python
import math

def find_min_n():
    n = 1
    while True:
        floors = []
        valid = True
        for k in range(1, 9):
            f = math.floor(n ** (1.0 / k))
            if f in floors:
                valid = False
                break
            floors.append(f)
        if valid:
            print(f"Found candidate: {n}")
            print(f"Floors: {floors}")
            print("This appears to be the minimal n satisfying the condition")
            return n
        n += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_n()
```
