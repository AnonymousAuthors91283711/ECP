Ground Truth Answer: fun n => choose (2 * n + 1) n
Proposed Answer: fun n => Nat.choose (2 * n - 1) n
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting strictly decreasing functions from Fin n to Fin n under certain constraints.

2. The ground truth answer is the central binomial coefficient C(2n+1, n).

3. The proposed answer is C(2n-1, n).

These are clearly different functions:
- For n=1: ground truth gives C(3,1)=3, proposed gives C(1,1)=1
- For n=2: ground truth gives C(5,2)=10, proposed gives C(3,2)=3

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the ground truth for any n ≥ 1. The difference between (2n+1) and (2n-1) in the binomial coefficient makes them fundamentally different.

<<<False>>>
