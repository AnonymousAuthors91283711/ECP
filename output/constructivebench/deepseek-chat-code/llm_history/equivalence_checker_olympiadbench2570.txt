Ground Truth Answer: {(27, 20, 13), (18, 20, 22)}
Proposed Answer: {(18, 20, 22), (27, 20, 13)}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is exactly the same as the ground truth answer, just presented in a different order. Since sets are unordered collections, the order of elements doesn't matter for equivalence. Both answers contain the exact same pairs (27, 20, 13) and (18, 20, 22).
