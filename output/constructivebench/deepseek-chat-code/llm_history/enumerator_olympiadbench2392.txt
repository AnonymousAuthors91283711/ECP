[write_program]
This problem asks to find all real numbers x such that 2 + √(x-2) = x-2. We'll solve it by enumerating possible solutions and checking them.

Approach:
1. First, note the domain restriction: x-2 ≥ 0 ⇒ x ≥ 2
2. Let y = √(x-2), then y ≥ 0 and the equation becomes 2 + y = y²
3. Solve the quadratic equation y² - y - 2 = 0
4. Check which solutions satisfy y ≥ 0
5. Convert back to x values

The Python program will:
1. Solve the quadratic equation symbolically
2. Filter valid y solutions
3. Convert back to x values
4. Verify each solution in the original equation

```python
import math

def solve_equation():
    # Solve y² - y - 2 = 0
    discriminant = 1 + 8  # b² - 4ac = (-1)² - 4*1*(-2) = 1 + 8 = 9
    y1 = (1 + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
    y2 = (1 - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
    
    # Filter non-negative y solutions
    valid_ys = [y for y in [y1, y2] if y >= 0]
    
    # Convert back to x values (x = y² + 2)
    solutions = [y**2 + 2 for y in valid_ys]
    
    # Verify solutions in original equation
    for x in solutions:
        lhs = 2 + math.sqrt(x - 2)
        rhs = x - 2
        # Print exact form if possible, else approximate
        if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-10:
            if x == 6.0:  # Exact solution
                print(6)
            else:
                print(x)
