theorem omnimath4214 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ a b : ℕ, ∃ (x y z : ℕ), x = a ∧ y = f b ∧ z = f (b + f a - 1) ∧ x + y > z ∧ y + z > x ∧ z + x > y) ↔ f = omnimath4214_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing constant functions:
f(n) = 3 works for small values
f(n) = 4 works for small values
f(n) = 5 works for small values
f(n) = 6 works for small values
f(n) = 7 works for small values
f(n) = 8 works for small values
f(n) = 9 works for small values

Testing linear functions:
f(n) = 1n + 0 works for small values

Testing quadratic functions:

Conjectured solution:
f(n) = n satisfies the condition. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun n : ℕ => n + 2>>> 

Explanation: The enumerated answers show constant functions f(n)=k (k≥3) work, but the simplest non-constant solution is linear. The pattern suggests f(n)=n+2 satisfies the triangle inequality conditions for all a,b. This maintains the required growth to ensure x+y>z etc. holds.
