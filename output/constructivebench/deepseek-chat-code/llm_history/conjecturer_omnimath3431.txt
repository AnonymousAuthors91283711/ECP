theorem omnimath3431 : 
  omnimath3431_answer ∉ {m : ℤ | ∃ n : ℤ, ∀ x : ℤ, (x + m) * (x + n) = x^2 + (m + n) * x + m * n ∧ m * n = -12} := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Possible m values from factor pairs: [-12, -6, -4, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]
Integers not appearing as m values: [-20, -19, -18, -17, -16, -15, -14, -13, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -5, 0, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
One such value is: -20. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
