Ground Truth Answer: 25/2
Proposed Answer: 100 / 8
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about maximizing a cyclic sum of products x_i * x_{i+2} under constraints that every triplet x_i + x_{i+1} + x_{i+2} ≤ 1 and all x_i ≥ 0.

2. The ground truth answer is 25/2 (which equals 12.5).

3. The proposed answer is 100/8 (which equals 12.5).

4. Both answers evaluate to the same numerical value (12.5), just expressed in different fractional forms.

5. The problem is symmetric and the maximum is achieved when we alternate between two values in a specific pattern, leading to this exact value.

Since both answers represent the same quantity mathematically, they are equivalent.
