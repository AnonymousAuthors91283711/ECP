Explanation: The problem asks for the maximum size of a container set C containing exactly one n-sized subset T with distinct rows and columns (like non-attacking rooks). The pattern suggests n² is sufficient (e.g., full n×n grid always contains exactly n! rook placements, but we only need one). The answer generalizes to n² for any n ≥ 1.
