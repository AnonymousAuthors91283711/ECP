This problem asks for the cardinality of the set of real fixed points of the 4th iterate of a piecewise linear function. The function is defined as 0 for x < 1 and 2x-2 for x ≥ 1. We'll analyze the fixed points by computing the iterated function and counting intersections with y=x.

The approach is to:
1. Compute f(f(f(f(x)))) by repeated composition
2. Find all x where this equals x
3. Count the distinct solutions

We'll implement this by:
1. Defining the base function f(x)
2. Computing the 4th iterate
3. Finding fixed points in different intervals
4. Counting unique solutions

```python
def f(x):
    return 0 if x < 1 else 2 * x - 2

def f4(x):
    return f(f(f(f(x))))

# Find fixed points by checking different intervals
fixed_points = set()

# Check x < 1 case
# f(x) = 0, f(f(x)) = f(0) = 0, etc. So f4(x) = 0
# Solve 0 = x → x=0
fixed_points.add(0)

# Check 1 ≤ x < 2 case
# f(x) = 2x-2, need to see where this lands
# For x in [1, 1.5), f(x) in [0,1)
# So f4(x) = f(f(f(2x-2))) = f(f(0)) = f(0) = 0
# Solve 0 = x → no solution in [1,2)

# For x in [1.5, 2), f(x) in [1,2)
# f(f(x)) = f(2x-2) = 2(2x-2)-2 = 4x-6
# Need to see where 4x-6 lands
# For x in [1.5, 1.75), 4x-6 ∈ [0,1)
# f4(x) = f(f(4x-6)) = f(0) = 0
# Solve 0 = x → no solution

# For x in [1.75, 2), 4x-6 ∈ [1,2)
# f(f(4x-6)) = 2(4x-6)-2 = 8x-14
# Need to see where 8x-14 lands
# For x in [1.75, 1.875), 8x-14 ∈ [0,1)
# f4(x) = f(8x-14) = 0
# Solve 0 = x → no solution

# For x in [1.875, 2), 8x-14 ∈ [1,2)
# f4(x) = 2(8x-14)-2 = 16x-30
# Solve 16x-30 = x → 15x=30 → x=2
# But x must be <2, so no solution

# Check x ≥ 2 case
# f(x) = 2x-2 ≥ 2
# f(f(x)) = 2(2x-2)-2 = 4x-6 ≥ 2
# f(f(f(x))) = 2(4x-6)-2 = 8x-14 ≥ 2
# f4(x) = 2(8x-14)-2 = 16x-30
# Solve 16x-30 = x → x=2
fixed_points.add(2)

# Check boundary cases
for x in [1, 1.5, 1.75, 1.875]:
    if f4(x) == x:
        fixed_points.add(x)

print("Fixed points found:", sorted(fixed_points))
print("Cardinality:", len(fixed_points))
```
