[write_program]
This problem asks for three natural numbers (r, q, p) that satisfy three conditions:
1. q = 2 * r
2. q = p - 4
3. (p + q + r) / 3 = 13

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of r, compute q and p from the first two equations, and check if they satisfy the third condition. We'll limit our search to reasonable values (up to 100) since the average is 13, suggesting the numbers are small.

```python
def find_solution():
    for r in range(1, 100):
        q = 2 * r  # From first condition
        p = q + 4  # From second condition (q = p - 4)
        # Check third condition: (p + q + r)/3 == 13
        if (p + q + r) == 39:  # 13 * 3 = 39
            print(f"r = {r}, q = {q}, p = {p}")

find_solution()
```
