abbrev P2004AMCB_13_answer : ℤ := sorry
theorem P2004AMCB_13 (c : ℝ) (hc : c ≠ 3/2) :
    let f := fun c => 3 / (2 * c - 3)
    let finv := fun c => (3 + 3 * c) / (2 * c)
    ∃ k l m n : ℤ, finv c * c * f c = (k * c + l) / (m * c + n) ∧ k * n^2 / (l * m) = P2004AMCB_13_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
Based on the problem statement and the functional relationships given, we can deduce the answer by analyzing the composition of f and finv. The key is to simplify the expression finv c * c * f c and extract the coefficients k, l, m, n.

The answer is derived from the simplified form of the equation where k=3, l=3, m=2, n=0, making the expression k*n²/(l*m) evaluate to 0.
