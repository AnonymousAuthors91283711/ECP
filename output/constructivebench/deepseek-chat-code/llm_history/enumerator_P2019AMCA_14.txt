This problem involves finding the condition on the complex constant `c` such that the given quartic polynomial has exactly 4 distinct complex roots. We'll approach this by:

1. Looking for when the polynomial has repeated roots (which would reduce the number of distinct roots)
2. Finding the condition on `c` that prevents repeated roots
3. Implementing a numerical search to find the critical value of |c|

We'll use the discriminant condition for repeated roots and search numerically for the threshold value.

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.polynomial import Polynomial

def find_critical_c():
    # Coefficients of the polynomial f(X) = X^4 + (2-3i)X^3 + (5-6i)X^2 + (2-3i)X + c
    # We need to find when discriminant is zero (repeated roots)
    
    # Numerical search parameters
    step = 0.01
    max_abs = 10.0
    precision = 1e-6
    
    # We'll search along the real axis first (simplest case)
    for re in np.arange(-max_abs, max_abs, step):
        for im in np.arange(-max_abs, max_abs, step):
            c = complex(re, im)
            # Build the polynomial
            coeffs = [c, 2-3j, 5-6j, 2-3j, 1]
            p = Polynomial(coeffs)
            
            # Compute roots
            roots = p.roots()
            
            # Check if any roots are close (indicating multiplicity)
            has_repeated = False
            for i in range(len(roots)):
                for j in range(i+1, len(roots)):
                    if abs(roots[i] - roots[j]) < precision:
                        has_repeated = True
                        break
                if has_repeated:
                    break
            
            if has_repeated:
                abs_c = abs(c)
                print(f"Found candidate |c| = {abs_c:.6f} at c = {c}")
                # Refine search around this value
                return abs_c  # For this problem, we just need the first critical value
    
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    critical_abs = find_critical_c()
    if critical_abs is not None:
        print(f"\nCritical |c| value appears to be: {critical_abs:.6f}")
    else:
        print("No critical value found in search range")
```
