Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the number of real solutions to the equation involving nested absolute values.

2. The ground truth answer is 6, which suggests there are 6 real numbers that satisfy this equation.

3. The proposed answer is 2, which would mean only 2 real solutions exist.

To determine if these are equivalent:
- The equation is complex but can be broken down by considering different intervals where the absolute value expressions change behavior.
- Through careful analysis (or plotting), we can see there should indeed be 6 solutions where the two nested absolute value functions intersect.
- The proposed answer of 2 is incorrect as it significantly undercounts the number of solutions.
