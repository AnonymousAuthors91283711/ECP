  ed_first_drink + ed_final + ann_first_drink + ann_final = P2014AMCB_6_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<48 / 7>>> 

Explanation: Solving the equations step-by-step leads to r = 48/7 satisfying all conditions. The final sum of all quantities (ed_first_drink + ed_final + ann_first_drink + ann_final) equals r itself, which is 48/7.
