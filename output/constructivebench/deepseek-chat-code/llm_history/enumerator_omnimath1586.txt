This problem involves finding linear recurrence sequences `a` (arithmetic) and `g` (geometric) that satisfy given conditions. We'll enumerate possible values for the parameters and verify the conditions.

```python
def solve():
    # We'll search for r (geometric ratio) and a1 (first term of arithmetic sequence)
    # The conditions give us equations to solve for these parameters
    
    # From a1 + g1 = 0 and a2 + g2 = 0, we get:
    # a1 + g1 = 0
    # (a1 + a1) + (r*g1) = 0 => 2a1 + r*(-a1) = 0 => a1*(2 - r) = 0
    
    # So either a1 = 0 or r = 2
    
    # Case 1: a1 = 0
    print("Case 1: a1 = 0")
    a1 = 0
    # Then g1 = -a1 = 0, but then g would be identically 0
    # Check if this works with other conditions:
    # a3 + g3 = 1 => (0 + 0 + 0) + 0 = 1 => False
    # So this case is invalid
    
    # Case 2: r = 2
    print("Case 2: r = 2")
    r = 2
    # From a1 + g1 = 0 => g1 = -a1
    # From a3 + g3 = 1 => (a1 + a1 + a1) + (r^2 * g1) = 1
    # 3a1 + 4*(-a1) = 1 => -a1 = 1 => a1 = -1
    a1 = -1
    g1 = 1  # since g1 = -a1
    
    # Verify all conditions:
    # a(n) = a1 + (n-1)*a1 = n*a1
    # g(n) = g1 * r^(n-1) = 1 * 2^(n-1)
    
    def a(n): return n * a1
    def g(n): return g1 * (r ** (n-1))
    
    conditions = [
        (a(1) + g(1) == 0),
        (a(2) + g(2) == 0),
        (a(3) + g(3) == 1),
        (a(4) + g(4) == 0),
    ]
    
    print("Verification of conditions:", all(conditions))
    
    # Compute a(10) + g(10)
    result = a(10) + g(10)
    print(f"a(10) + g(10) = {result}")

solve()
