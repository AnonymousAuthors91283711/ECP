Based on the problem statement, we're looking for the cardinality of the set of real triples (a,b,c) that satisfy certain conditions related to roots of a quartic polynomial being tangents of y, 2y, and 3y. The conditions imply a specific symmetric structure and distinct roots. The most likely answer is that there are infinitely many such triples.

<<<0>>> 

Explanation: The problem describes a family of polynomials with roots related by tangent function at multiples of y. Since y can vary continuously (with appropriate restrictions), this suggests an uncountable infinity of solutions. In Lean, infinite cardinalities are typically represented by 0 in encard.
