This problem involves calculating the area of a specific set S in the unit square [0,1]Ã—[0,1]. The set S is defined by conditions involving floor functions of logarithms. We'll enumerate possible values by discretizing the unit square and checking the conditions.

The approach:
1. Discretize the unit square into small intervals (e.g., steps of 0.0001)
2. For each point (x,y), check if it satisfies all conditions
3. Accumulate the area of points that satisfy the conditions
4. Simplify the resulting fraction to find m/n in lowest terms

```python
import math

def is_in_S(x, y):
    if not (0 < x <= 1 and 0 < y <= 1):
        return False
    try:
        log2x = math.log(1/x, 2)
        log5y = math.log(1/y, 5)
        k = math.floor(log2x) / 2
        l = math.floor(log5y) / 2
        return k.is_integer() and l.is_integer()
    except ValueError:
        return False

def compute_area(step=0.0001):
    area = 0.0
    x = step/2
    while x <= 1:
        y = step/2
        while y <= 1:
            if is_in_S(x, y):
                area += step * step
            y += step
        x += step
    return area

def simplify_fraction(a, tol=1e-6):
    # Find best rational approximation
    best_num, best_den = 0, 1
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for den in range(1, 1000):
        num = round(a * den)
        diff = abs(num/den - a)
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            best_num, best_den = num, den
            if min_diff < tol:
                break
    # Simplify
    g = math.gcd(best_num, best_den)
    return best_num//g, best_den//g

m, n = simplify_fraction(area)
print(f"Numerator: {m}, Denominator: {n}")
print(f"Simplified fraction: {m}/{n}")
