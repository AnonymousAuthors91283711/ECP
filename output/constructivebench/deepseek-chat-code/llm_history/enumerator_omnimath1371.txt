[write_program]
This problem involves a recurrence relation with a(n+2) = 6*a(n) - a(n+1) and initial condition a(0)=1. We need to investigate the possible values of a(2007) under the constraint that all terms remain positive.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Compute the sequence up to n=2007 for different initial a(1) values
2. Find the range of a(1) values that keep all terms positive
3. Observe the behavior of a(2007) as a(1) varies

```python
def compute_sequence(a1, n_max=2007):
    """Compute the sequence up to n_max with a(0)=1 and given a(1)"""
    seq = [1.0, float(a1)]
    for n in range(2, n_max + 1):
        next_val = 6 * seq[n-2] - seq[n-1]
        seq.append(next_val)
        if next_val <= 0:
            return None  # Sequence violates positivity
    return seq

def find_positive_range():
    """Find the range of a1 values that keep all terms positive"""
    # Binary search to find boundaries
    low, high = 0.0, 6.0  # Initial bounds
    tol = 1e-10
    
    # Find lower bound (where terms stay positive)
    left = 0.0
    right = 6.0
    for _ in range(100):
        mid = (left + right) / 2
        if compute_sequence(mid) is not None:
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid
    lower_bound = right
    
    # Find upper bound
    left = 0.0
    right = 6.0
    for _ in range(100):
        mid = (left + right) / 2
        if compute_sequence(mid) is not None:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid
    upper_bound = left
    
    return lower_bound, upper_bound

def main():
    # Find the range where all terms are positive
    lower, upper = find_positive_range()
    print(f"Range of a(1) keeping all terms positive: [{lower:.10f}, {upper:.10f}]")
    
    # Sample some values within the range
    for a1 in [lower, (lower+upper)/2, upper]:
        seq = compute_sequence(a1)
        if seq:
            print(f"For a(1) = {a1:.10f}, a(2007) â‰ˆ {seq[2007]:.5e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program first determines the range of valid a(1) values that keep all terms positive, then computes a(2007) for sample values within this range. The output shows the behavior of the sequence at the boundaries and midpoint of the valid range. The exact value would require solving the recurrence relation analytically, but this numerical approach helps understand the behavior.
