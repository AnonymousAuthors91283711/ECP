Ground Truth Answer: {(5, 3)}
Proposed Answer: {(m, n) | m = 2 * n - 1}
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The ground truth answer specifies only one solution pair: (5,3). This means that only when m=5 and n=3 does the infinite set condition hold.

2. The proposed answer suggests a general solution where m = 2n - 1. For n=3, this would give m=5, which matches the ground truth. However, the proposed answer claims this works for all n ≥ 3, while the ground truth only confirms it for n=3.

3. The problem requires that the set is infinite only for specific (m,n) pairs. The proposed answer is too broad, as it's unlikely that all pairs satisfying m=2n-1 would work (for example, n=4, m=7 might not satisfy the condition).

4. The ground truth answer is very specific, suggesting that (5,3) might be the only solution, or at least the only known solution.

Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect because it claims many more solutions than what's confirmed in the ground truth.
