This problem involves finding a unique real number `x` such that the nested floor function equation `x * floor(x * floor(x * floor(x * floor(x)))) = 122` holds. We'll approach this by:

1. Understanding that the solution likely lies between 2 and 3 (since 2^5=32 and 3^5=243 bracket 122)
2. Systematically testing values in this range with increasing precision
3. Using binary search for efficiency once we narrow down the interval

The program will:
- Start with a reasonable range (2.0 to 3.0)
- Use binary search to find the value that satisfies the equation
- Print intermediate candidates that get closer to the solution

```python
def floor(x):
    return int(x)

def equation(x):
    return x * floor(x * floor(x * floor(x * floor(x))))

def find_solution():
    low = 2.0
    high = 3.0
    target = 122
    best_x = None
    best_diff = float('inf')
    
    for _ in range(100):  # Sufficient iterations for good precision
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        val = equation(mid)
        diff = abs(val - target)
        
        if diff < best_diff:
            best_diff = diff
            best_x = mid
            print(f"Current best candidate: {best_x}")
        
        if val < target:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid
    
    print(f"Final candidate solution: {best_x}")

find_solution()
```
