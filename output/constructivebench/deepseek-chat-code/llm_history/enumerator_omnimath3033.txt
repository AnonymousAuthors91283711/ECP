[write_program]
This problem involves finding the smallest positive integer n where after 5 days of fractional reductions (following a specific pattern), exactly 1 remains. The reduction pattern is: each day k, we subtract (k/(k+1)) of the current amount. We'll write a Python program to search for the smallest such n.

The approach is:
1. For each candidate n starting from 1 upwards
2. Apply the 5-day reduction process
3. Check if the final amount equals 1
4. Return the first n that satisfies this condition

```python
def find_min_n():
    for n in range(1, 1000000):  # Large enough range to find the solution
        day = n
        # Day 1: subtract 1/2
        day -= day // 2
        # Day 2: subtract 2/3
        day -= (day * 2) // 3
        # Day 3: subtract 3/4
        day -= (day * 3) // 4
        # Day 4: subtract 4/5
        day -= (day * 4) // 5
        # Day 5: subtract 5/6
        day -= (day * 5) // 6
        
        if day == 1:
            print(f"Found candidate: {n}")
            return n  # Return the first (smallest) solution found

if __name__ == "__main__":
    min_n = find_min_n()
    print(f"The smallest n is: {min_n}")
```
