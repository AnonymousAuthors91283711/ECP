theorem omnimath298 (x y : ℕ) (hx : 0 < x) (hy : 0 < y) :
    x^y = y^(x - y) ↔ (x, y) ∈ omnimath298_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(9, 3), (8, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(x, y) | x = y} ∪ {(8, 2), (9, 3)}
Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The problem asks for all pairs (x,y) of positive natural numbers where x^y = y^(x-y).

2. The ground truth answer gives exactly two specific solutions: (9,3) and (8,2).

3. The proposed answer includes all pairs where x=y plus the two specific solutions from the ground truth.

4. For the case where x=y:
   - x^y = y^(x-y) becomes x^x = y^0 = 1
   - This only holds when x=y=1 (since 1^1=1)
   - But the proposed answer includes ALL pairs where x=y, which would include (2,2), (3,3), etc. which don't satisfy the equation

Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect because it includes too many solutions (all x=y pairs beyond (1,1)). The only correct solutions are (9,3), (8,2), and (1,1).
