This problem involves finding the absolute value of the sum of coefficients of a cubic polynomial with specific complex roots. We'll enumerate possible real coefficients (a, b, c) by considering the relationships between the roots and coefficients (Vieta's formulas).

The polynomial has roots at w+3i, w+9i, and 2w-4. We'll:
1. Express the sum, sum of products, and product of roots using Vieta's formulas
2. Solve for w using the relationships between roots
3. Compute the coefficients a, b, c
4. Calculate |a + b + c|

```python
import cmath

def solve_problem():
    # Let the roots be r1 = w + 3j, r2 = w + 9j, r3 = 2w - 4
    # From Vieta's formulas:
    # r1 + r2 + r3 = -a
    # r1*r2 + r2*r3 + r3*r1 = b
    # r1*r2*r3 = -c
    
    # We'll solve for w first by considering the sum of roots
    # (w+3j) + (w+9j) + (2w-4) = 4w -4 + 12j = -a (real)
    # So imaginary part must be 0: 12j implies contradiction unless we adjust
    
    # Alternative approach: since coefficients are real, non-real roots must come in conjugate pairs
    # But we have two roots with imaginary parts (w+3j and w+9j)
    # Therefore w must be real to make their conjugates also roots
    
    # Let w be real
    w = (4 - 12j) / 4  # From setting imaginary part to 0
    # But this gives complex w, which contradicts w being real
    
    # Correct approach: since two roots are complex, the third must be real
    # Therefore 2w-4 must be real => w is real
    # Then the other two roots must be complex conjugates
    
    # So w+3j and w+9j must be conjugates => 3 = -9, which is false
    # This suggests our initial assumption is wrong
    
    # Alternative interpretation: maybe only two roots are given (multiplicity)
    # But problem states three roots
    
    # Let's try numerical approach to find w
    # The polynomial is (x - (w+3j))(x - (w+9j))(x - (2w-4))
    # Expand and collect terms to find coefficients
    
    # We can find w by equating coefficients from different representations
    # Let's compute the derivative approach
    
    print("This problem requires symbolic computation beyond simple enumeration.")
    print("A proper solution would need to:")
    print("1. Express the polynomial in terms of w")
    print("2. Use the fact that coefficients are real to establish relationships")
    print("3. Solve for w using the conjugate root theorem")
    print("4. Compute the coefficients and their sum")
    
    # For completeness, here's a numerical approximation approach
    # This is not rigorous but can help conjecture the answer
    def polynomial(w, x):
        return (x - (w + 3j)) * (x - (w + 9j)) * (x - (2*w - 4))
    
    # Sample w values to find when coefficients are real
    for w_real in range(-5, 5):
        w = complex(w_real)
        p = polynomial(w, 0)  # Constant term
        if abs(p.imag) < 1e-6:  # Check if imaginary part is approximately zero
            a = -( (w+3j) + (w+9j) + (2*w-4) )
            b = (w+3j)*(w+9j) + (w+9j)*(2*w-4) + (2*w-4)*(w+3j)
            c = - (w+3j)*(w+9j)*(2*w-4)
            sum_abc = a + b + c
