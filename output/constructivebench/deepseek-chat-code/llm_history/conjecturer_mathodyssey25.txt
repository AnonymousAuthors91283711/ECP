Computing K(2004,2004)...
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated answers, we observe that when n = m, the set K(n,n) typically contains only n itself when n is even, and sometimes more elements when n is odd. However, for n=2004 (even), the pattern suggests K(n,n) = {n}. Therefore, the cardinality is 1.
