Ground Truth Answer: 1 / Nat.factorial 2004
Proposed Answer: (-1)^2005 / (∏ k ∈ Finset.range 2004, (1 - (k + 1)))
Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The problem involves a system of equations with Vandermonde-like structure, suggesting the solution relates to polynomial interpolation.

2. The ground truth answer is 1/2004! (factorial of 2004), which makes sense as it's the coefficient in a polynomial basis expansion.

3. The proposed answer has:
   - A sign term (-1)^2005 which equals -1 (since 2005 is odd)
   - A denominator that's a product of (1 - (k+1)) for k from 0 to 2003

4. Evaluating the denominator:
   ∏_{k=0}^{2003} (1 - (k+1)) = ∏_{k=1}^{2004} (-k) = (-1)^2004 * 2004! = 2004!

5. So the proposed answer simplifies to: -1 / 2004!

6. This differs from the ground truth answer (1/2004!) by a sign.

The proposed answer is almost correct but has an incorrect sign. The structure is similar but the (-1)^2005 term makes it wrong.
