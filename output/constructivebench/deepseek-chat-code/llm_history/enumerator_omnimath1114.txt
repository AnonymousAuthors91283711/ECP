[write_program]
This problem involves counting the number of functions from Fin 36 to Fin 10 where the sum of all outputs modulo 10 is not in the range of the function. We'll approach this by enumerating smaller cases first to identify a pattern.

We'll write a Python program that:
1. Iterates through all possible functions from Fin n to Fin k for small n and k
2. For each function, calculates the sum of outputs modulo k
3. Checks if this sum is not in the function's range
4. Counts such functions and prints results for small cases

```python
from itertools import product

def count_valid_functions(n, k):
    count = 0
    for func in product(range(k), repeat=n):
        total = sum(func) % k
        if total not in func:
            count += 1
    print(f"For n={n}, k={k}: {count} valid functions")

# Test small cases to identify pattern
for n in range(1, 5):
    for k in range(1, 5):
        count_valid_functions(n, k)
```

The program enumerates all possible functions (as tuples) for small values of n and k, counts those satisfying the condition, and prints the results. This helps identify patterns that might lead to a general formula for the original problem (n=36, k=10).

Note that for the actual problem size (n=36, k=10), brute-force enumeration is infeasible (10^36 possibilities), but examining small cases can reveal the underlying combinatorial structure.

The output shows counts for n from 1 to 4 and k from 1 to 4, which can help conjecture a general formula that might be provable by induction or combinatorial arguments.
