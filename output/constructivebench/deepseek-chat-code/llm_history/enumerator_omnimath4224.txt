[write_program]
This problem involves finding the minimal positive integer k such that the k-th iterate of a piecewise function f evaluated at 0 returns to 0. The function f depends on parameters a and b (with 1 ≤ a ≤ b), and has different definitions based on whether its input is ≤ M or > M, where M = (a+b)/2.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Select sample values for a and b (with 1 ≤ a ≤ b)
2. For each (a,b) pair, compute M
3. Define the function f and its iterations
4. Find the smallest k > 0 where f^k(0) = 0
5. Output results for small parameter values

```python
def compute_min_k(a, b):
    M = (a + b) // 2
    visited = set()
    current = 0
    k = 0
    
    while True:
        k += 1
        # Apply the function f
        if current <= M:
            current += a
        else:
            current -= b
        
        if current == 0:
            return k
        
        # Check for cycles that don't return to 0
        if (current, k % (2*(a+b))) in visited:
            return -1  # no solution exists
        visited.add((current, k % (2*(a+b))))

# Test small parameter values
for a in range(1, 5):
    for b in range(a, 5):
        min_k = compute_min_k(a, b)
        if min_k != -1:
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}: minimal k = {min_k}")
        else:
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}: no solution exists")
```
