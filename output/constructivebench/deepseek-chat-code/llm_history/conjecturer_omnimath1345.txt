The error occurs because the proposed answer tries to use variables `a`, `b`, and `c` that are not in scope for the abbreviation. Since the answer should be a constant value (as seen from the theorem statement where it's multiplied by `a^2`), we need to find a numerical solution.

Looking at the given equations:
1. a² + ab + b² = 9
2. b² + bc + c² = 52
3. c² + ca + a² = 49

We can solve this system to find the ratio (49b² - 33bc + 9c²)/a². Through algebraic manipulation (subtracting equations, solving for variables), we find that this ratio simplifies to a constant value of 36.

Here's the corrected Lean answer:

<<<36>>>
