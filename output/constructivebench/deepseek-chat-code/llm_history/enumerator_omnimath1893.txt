This problem involves solving a system of equations with positive real numbers a, b, c, and n. We need to find the value of n given the relationships between a, b, and c. The approach is to express all variables in terms of one variable and solve for n.

We'll:
1. Express b in terms of a using the first equation (a+b)/a = 3
2. Express c in terms of b using the second equation (b+c)/b = 4
3. Substitute these into the third equation (c+a)/c = n and solve for n

The Python program will verify the algebraic solution by computing n from the given relationships.

```python
def solve_n():
    # Let's choose a=1 as a sample value since the ratios are independent of scale
    a = 1.0
    
    # From (a + b)/a = 3 => 1 + b = 3 => b = 2
    b = 2.0
    
    # From (b + c)/b = 4 => 2 + c = 8 => c = 6
    c = 6.0
    
    # Now compute n from (c + a)/c = (6 + 1)/6 = 7/6
    n = (c + a) / c
    
    print(f"For a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, n={n}")

solve_n()
```
