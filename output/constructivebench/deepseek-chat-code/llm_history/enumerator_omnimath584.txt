This problem involves finding the value of `a` given a system of equations with variables `x`, `a`, and `c`. The equations are:
1. 20 + c = x
2. 50 + c = a * x
3. 100 + c = a² * x

We can solve this system by eliminating variables. First, subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate `c`:
(50 + c) - (20 + c) = a*x - x → 30 = x(a - 1)

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 3:
(100 + c) - (50 + c) = a²*x - a*x → 50 = x(a² - a)

Now we have two equations:
1. 30 = x(a - 1)
2. 50 = x(a² - a)

Divide equation 2 by equation 1 to eliminate x:
50/30 = (x(a² - a))/(x(a - 1)) → 5/3 = a

Thus, the exact value of `a` is 5/3. Here's a Python program that verifies this solution:

```python
def verify_solution():
    a = 5/3
    # From equation 1: 30 = x(a - 1)
    x = 30 / (a - 1)
    # From first original equation: 20 + c = x
    c = x - 20
    # Verify all equations
    eq1 = abs(20 + c - x) < 1e-10
    eq2 = abs(50 + c - a * x) < 1e-10
    eq3 = abs(100 + c - a**2 * x) < 1e-10
    if eq1 and eq2 and eq3:
        print(f"Solution verified: a = {a}")
    else:
        print("Solution not valid")

verify_solution()
