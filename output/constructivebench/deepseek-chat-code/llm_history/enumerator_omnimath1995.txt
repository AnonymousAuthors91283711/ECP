This problem involves counting the number of possible configurations when flipping two coins from a set of 10 coins, where the initial state is all coins showing heads (represented as `true`). The first flip turns one coin to tails (`false`), and the second flip toggles another coin (either heads to tails or tails to heads).

We'll enumerate all possible pairs of coin flips (order matters) and count the distinct resulting configurations. Since there are 10 coins, there are 10 choices for the first flip and 10 for the second (including flipping the same coin twice).

```python
def count_configurations():
    n = 10  # number of coins
    configurations = set()

    for first_flip in range(n):
        # After first flip: all True except first_flip position
        config = [True] * n
        config[first_flip] = False
        
        for second_flip in range(n):
            # Toggle the second_flip position
            new_config = config.copy()
            new_config[second_flip] = not new_config[second_flip]
            configurations.add(tuple(new_config))
    
    print(f"Total distinct configurations: {len(configurations)}")

count_configurations()
```
