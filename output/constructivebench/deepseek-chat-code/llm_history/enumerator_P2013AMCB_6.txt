This problem asks for the value of x + y given the equation x² + y² = 10x - 6y - 34. We can approach this by completing the squares for both x and y terms to find the center and radius of the circle represented by this equation. The sum x + y will be constant for all points (x,y) on this circle since it's a single point (degenerate circle with radius 0).

Here's a Python program that verifies this by checking integer values around the expected center point:

```python
def find_xy_sum():
    # Complete the squares for x and y in the equation x^2 + y^2 = 10x - 6y - 34
    # x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y = -34
    # (x^2 - 10x + 25) + (y^2 + 6y + 9) = -34 + 25 + 9
    # (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 0
    # This implies x=5 and y=-3 is the only solution
    
    # Verify by checking nearby integer points
    for x in range(3, 8):  # Check x values around 5
        for y in range(-5, 0):  # Check y values around -3
            lhs = x**2 + y**2
            rhs = 10*x - 6*y - 34
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}, x+y={x+y}")
    
    # The only solution is x=5, y=-3, so x+y=2
    print("The value of x + y is:", 5 + -3)

find_xy_sum()
```
