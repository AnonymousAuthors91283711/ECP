[write_program]
This problem involves a recursive sequence with square roots and powers. We'll write a Python program to compute the sequence values up to n=10 and output the floor of a_10. The recursion involves floating-point operations, so we'll use precise calculations with the `decimal` module.

```python
from decimal import Decimal, getcontext

def compute_sequence():
    getcontext().prec = 50  # High precision to handle square roots and powers
    a = [Decimal(0)]  # a0 = 0
    for n in range(10):
        prev = a[-1]
        term = 4**n - prev**2
        sqrt_term = term.sqrt() if term >= 0 else Decimal(0)  # Handle possible negative due to precision
        next_val = (Decimal(8)/Decimal(5)) * prev + (Decimal(6)/Decimal(5)) * sqrt_term
        a.append(next_val)
        print(f"a_{n+1} = {next_val}")
    
    a10_floor = int(a[10].to_integral_value(rounding="FLOOR"))
    print(f"\nFloor of a_10: {a10_floor}")
