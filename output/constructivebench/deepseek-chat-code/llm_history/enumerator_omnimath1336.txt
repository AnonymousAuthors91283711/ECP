[write_program]
This problem involves computing a triple infinite sum of terms with denominators composed of powers of 2, 3, and 5. To approach this, we'll write a Python program to compute partial sums of this series up to reasonable limits for a, b, and c to observe convergence behavior.

The program will:
1. Iterate through possible values of a, b, c with a ≤ b ≤ c
2. Compute each term 1/(2^a * 3^b * 5^c)
3. Accumulate the sum while printing intermediate results
4. Use small upper bounds for practical computation

```python
def compute_partial_sum(max_a, max_b, max_c):
    total = 0.0
    for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
        for b in range(a, max_b + 1):
            for c in range(b, max_c + 1):
                term = 1 / (2**a * 3**b * 5**c)
                total += term
                # Print every 1000 terms to show progress
                if (a-1)*max_b*max_c + (b-a)*max_c + (c-b) + 1 % 1000 == 0:
                    print(f"Partial sum after {a},{b},{c}: {total}")
    return total

# Using small sample values for demonstration
max_a = 5
max_b = 5
max_c = 5
print(f"Computing with parameters: max_a={max_a}, max_b={max_b}, max_c={max_c}")
result = compute_partial_sum(max_a, max_b, max_c)
print(f"Final partial sum: {result}")
```
