[write_program]
This problem is about determining for which positive real numbers c there exists a coloring of the integer grid ℤ×ℤ with finitely many colors where any two points of the same color are at least distance c^i apart, where i is their color index.

We'll write a program to:
1. Test small rational values of c
2. For each c, try to find a valid coloring pattern
3. Output successful c values

The key insight is that for c ≤ √2, we can use a checkerboard pattern, while for larger c we need more complex patterns. We'll test c values systematically.

```python
import math

def is_valid_coloring(c, max_k=5):
    # Try simple periodic colorings with period up to max_k
    for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
        valid = True
        for i in range(k):
            min_dist_sq = float('inf')
            # Check all pairs of points colored i within a large enough window
            for x1 in range(-2*k, 2*k + 1):
                for y1 in range(-2*k, 2*k + 1):
                    if (x1 + y1) % k != i:
                        continue
                    for x2 in range(-2*k, 2*k + 1):
                        for y2 in range(-2*k, 2*k + 1):
                            if (x2 + y2) % k != i:
                                continue
                            if x1 == x2 and y1 == y2:
                                continue
                            dx = x1 - x2
                            dy = y1 - y2
                            dist_sq = dx*dx + dy*dy
                            if dist_sq < min_dist_sq:
                                min_dist_sq = dist_sq
            if min_dist_sq < (c**i)**2:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            return True
    return False

def main():
    # Test rational c values between 1 and 2
    for numerator in range(10, 20):
        c = numerator / 10
        if is_valid_coloring(c):
            print(f"Valid c found: {c}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
