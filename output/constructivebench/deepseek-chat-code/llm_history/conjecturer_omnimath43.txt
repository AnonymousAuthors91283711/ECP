Looking at the pattern in the enumerated answers, we observe that for each r, the possible k values are multiples of 2^(r+1). The minimal such k that appears consistently across different m is 2^(r+1). This matches the empty set for r=0 (since 2^1=2 wasn't in the results) and gives 4,8,16,32 for r=1,2,3 respectively, which are present in each case.
