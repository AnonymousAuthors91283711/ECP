abbrev P2009AMCA_6_answer : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem P2009AMCA_6 (m n : ℕ) : 
  12^(m * n) = P2009AMCA_6_answer m n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun m n => (2^m)^(2*n) * (3^n)^m
Proposed Answer: fun m n : ℕ => 12^(m * n)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for an expression equivalent to 12^(m*n)
2. The ground truth answer expands this as (2^m)^(2*n) * (3^n)^m
   - This can be simplified: (2^(m*2n)) * (3^(n*m)) = (2^(2mn)) * (3^(mn)) = (4^mn) * (3^mn) = (4*3)^mn = 12^(mn)
3. The proposed answer is simply 12^(m*n), which is exactly what we're trying to express

The proposed answer is mathematically identical to the ground truth answer, just in a more compact form. Both expressions evaluate to the same value for all natural numbers m and n.
