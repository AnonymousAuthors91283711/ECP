[write_program]
This problem asks whether there exist integers m and n satisfying the equation 5m² - 6mn + 7n² = 1985. We'll write a Python program to search for such integer pairs (m,n) within a reasonable range.

The approach:
1. The equation is quadratic in both variables, so we'll search within bounds where the terms could reasonably combine to 1985.
2. We'll iterate n first since the coefficient of n² is larger, making it likely to have a smaller range.
3. For each n, we'll solve the quadratic equation for m and check if the solution is integer.

```python
def solve_omnimath4405():
    target = 1985
    # Calculate reasonable bounds for n based on 7n^2 <= 1985 + some margin
    max_n = int((target / 7)**0.5) + 10
    min_n = -max_n
    found = False
    
    for n in range(min_n, max_n + 1):
        # The equation is quadratic in m: 5m^2 - (6n)m + (7n^2 - 1985) = 0
        a = 5
        b = -6 * n
        c = 7 * n * n - target
        
        discriminant = b * b - 4 * a * c
        if discriminant < 0:
            continue
        
        sqrt_discriminant = int(round(discriminant**0.5))
        if sqrt_discriminant * sqrt_discriminant != discriminant:
            continue
        
        for sign in [-1, 1]:
            numerator = -b + sign * sqrt_discriminant
            if numerator % (2 * a) != 0:
                continue
            m = numerator // (2 * a)
            print(f"Found solution: m = {m}, n = {n}")
            found = True
    
    if not found:
        print("No integer solutions found")
