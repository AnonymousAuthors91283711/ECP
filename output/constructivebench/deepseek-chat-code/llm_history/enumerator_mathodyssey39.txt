[write_program]
The problem asks to find all natural numbers k where the product of their digits equals (25*k)//8 - 211, and then sum all such numbers. We'll write a Python program to search for these numbers efficiently.

Key observations:
1. The digit product grows much slower than k itself, so we can set reasonable bounds
2. For numbers with more digits, the digit product becomes too small to satisfy the equation
3. We'll check numbers up to 10^6 as a practical limit

```python
def digit_product(n):
    product = 1
    while n > 0:
        product *= n % 10
        n = n // 10
    return product

def find_solutions():
    solutions = []
    for k in range(1, 10**6 + 1):
        dp = digit_product(k)
        rhs = (25 * k) // 8 - 211
        if dp == rhs:
            solutions.append(k)
            print(f"Found solution: {k}")  # Stream partial results
    
    if solutions:
        print(f"Sum of all solutions: {sum(solutions)}")
    else:
        print("No solutions found")

find_solutions()
```
