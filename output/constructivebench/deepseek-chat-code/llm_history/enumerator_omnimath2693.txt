[write_program]
This problem asks for a unique natural number N between 400 and 600 that is odd, divisible by both 5 and 11, and whose digit sum equals some unknown value. We'll write a Python program to find all candidates for N and compute their digit sums.

The approach:
1. Find all numbers between 401 and 599 (inclusive) that are odd and divisible by both 5 and 11 (which means divisible by 55)
2. For each candidate, calculate the sum of its digits
3. Print each valid number with its digit sum
4. Since the problem states there's a unique solution, we'll see only one candidate

```python
def find_numbers():
    # Numbers must be odd and divisible by 5*11=55 between 400 and 600
    start = (400 // 55 + 1) * 55  # First multiple of 55 >400
    if start % 2 == 0:
        start += 55  # Make it odd
    
    for n in range(start, 600, 110):  # Step by 2*55=110 to maintain odd and divisible by 55
        digit_sum = sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
        print(f"N = {n}, digit sum = {digit_sum}")

find_numbers()
