theorem P2023AMCB_12 (z : ℂ) :
    custom_op z z = z ^ 2 + 40 ↔ Complex.abs z = P2023AMCB_12_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 5 * Real.sqrt 2
Proposed Answer: 2 * Real.sqrt 10
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a custom operation `custom_op` and relates it to the square of a complex number plus 40, with a condition involving the complex number's magnitude.

2. The ground truth answer is `5 * Real.sqrt 2` (which equals approximately 7.071)

3. The proposed answer is `2 * Real.sqrt 10` (which equals approximately 6.325)

4. These are clearly different numerical values (7.071 ≠ 6.325), and they cannot be algebraically equivalent since:
   - (5√2)² = 25*2 = 50
   - (2√10)² = 4*10 = 40
   - 50 ≠ 40

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
