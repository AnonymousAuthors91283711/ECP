The problem asks to find consecutive integers A and B (where B = A+1) such that the expression 1*B² + 2*B + 3 equals 1*A² + 2*A + 3. We need to find the minimal sum A+B that satisfies this condition.

We'll solve this by:
1. Iterating through possible values of A
2. Setting B = A+1 for each A
3. Checking if the equation holds
4. Tracking the minimal sum A+B that satisfies the condition

```python
def solve():
    min_sum = None
    # Iterate A up to a reasonable limit (equation grows quadratically)
    for A in range(1, 1000):
        B = A + 1
        lhs = 1 * B**2 + 2 * B + 3
        rhs = 1 * A**2 + 2 * A + 3
        if lhs == rhs:
            current_sum = A + B
            print(f"Found solution: A={A}, B={B}, sum={current_sum}")
            if min_sum is None or current_sum < min_sum:
                min_sum = current_sum
    if min_sum is not None:
        print(f"Minimal sum is: {min_sum}")
    else:
        print("No solution found in search range")

solve()
```
