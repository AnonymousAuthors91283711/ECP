This problem involves counting the number of 4-digit numbers (from 0000 to 2399) whose digit sum is less than the digit sum of 2021 (which is 2+0+2+1=5), then finding the fraction of such numbers out of all 2400 possibilities.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Calculate the digit sum of 2021 (target sum)
2. Count how many numbers from 0 to 2399 have digit sum < target
3. Calculate the fraction
4. Output the count and fraction

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in f"{n:04d}")

target = digit_sum(2021)
count = 0

for n in range(2400):
    if digit_sum(n) < target:
        count += 1

fraction = count / 2400
print(f"Count: {count}")
print(f"Fraction: {fraction}")
```
