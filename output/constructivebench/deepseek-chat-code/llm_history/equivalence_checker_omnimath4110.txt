theorem omnimath4110 (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
  (∀ x y, f (⌊x⌋ * y) = f x * ⌊f y⌋) ↔ f ∈ omnimath4110_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {f | (∀ x, f x = 0) ∨ (∃ c, 1 ≤ c ∧ c < 2 ∧ ∀ x, f x = c)}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ (c : ℝ), f = Function.const ℝ c ∧ (c = 0 ∨ c = 1)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all real-valued functions f:ℝ→ℝ that satisfy the functional equation ∀ x y, f(⌊x⌋ * y) = f x * ⌊f y⌋.

2. The ground truth answer gives two possibilities:
   - The zero function (f(x) = 0 for all x)
   - A constant function where the constant c satisfies 1 ≤ c < 2

3. The proposed answer suggests:
   - Only constant functions where c is either 0 or 1

Comparison:
- Both include the zero function (c=0 case)
- The ground truth allows any constant between [1,2), while the proposed answer only allows c=1
- The proposed answer misses all other constants in [1,2) that satisfy the condition

The proposed answer is partially correct but too restrictive, as it excludes valid solutions where c ∈ (1,2).
