[write_program]
This problem appears to be a simple algebraic expression evaluation, but we'll write a Python program to verify the computation. The expression is `(x + 2 - x) * (2 - x - 2)` where `x = 2`. We'll compute this step by step.

```python
# Evaluating the expression (x + 2 - x) * (2 - x - 2) where x = 2
x = 2
first_term = (x + 2 - x)  # simplifies to 2
second_term = (2 - x - 2)  # simplifies to -x
result = first_term * second_term
print(result)  # Outputs -4
```
