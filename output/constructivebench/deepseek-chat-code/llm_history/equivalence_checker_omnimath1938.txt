Ground Truth Answer: 127 / 512
Proposed Answer: 341 / 1024
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves a 5-state Markov chain where each state is connected to its two adjacent states (forming a pentagon), with transition probabilities of 1/2 to each neighbor.

2. We're asked to find the probability of returning to state 0 after 10 steps, which is given by (transMatrix^10) 0 0.

3. The ground truth answer is 127/512 ≈ 0.248046875.

4. The proposed answer is 341/1024 ≈ 0.3330078125.

The proposed answer is significantly different from the ground truth answer (about 34% difference in probability). For a 10-step random walk on a pentagon, the correct probability should indeed be 127/512.
