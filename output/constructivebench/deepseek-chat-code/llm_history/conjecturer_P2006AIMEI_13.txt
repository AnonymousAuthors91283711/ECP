theorem P2006AIMEI_13 :
  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | n < 1000 ∧ ∃ m : ℕ, (∑ k in Finset.range (2^(n-1)), padicValNat 2 (2*k)) = m^2} P2006AIMEI_13_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found n = 1 with sum = 0 = 0^2
Found n = 2 with sum = 1 = 1^2
Found n = 8 with sum = 16 = 4^2
Found n = 102 with sum = 484 = 22^2
Found n = 313 with sum = 1849 = 43^2
Found n = 352 with sum = 2116 = 46^2
Found n = 449 with sum = 2809 = 53^2
Found n = 480 with sum = 3025 = 55^2
Found n = 727 with sum = 4900 = 70^2
Found n = 782 with sum = 5329 = 73^2
Found n = 898 with sum = 6241 = 79^2

The largest n < 1000 is 898. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<898>>>
