[write_program]
This problem involves finding the greatest natural number `n` for which there exists a sequence `q` starting at `q₀` where each subsequent term is defined by `q i = (q (i-1) - 1)^3 + 3` and each term is a prime power. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible sequences for small values of `q₀` and find the maximum `n` where the sequence remains valid.

```python
def is_prime_power(m):
    if m < 2:
        return False
    # Check for prime factors
    for p in range(2, int(m**0.5) + 1):
        if m % p == 0:
            # Check if m is power of p
            while m % p == 0:
                m = m // p
            return m == 1
    return True  # m is prime

def find_max_n(q0):
    n = 0
    q = q0
    while True:
        if not is_prime_power(q):
            break
        n += 1
        q = (q - 1)**3 + 3
    return n - 1  # subtract 1 since we broke after failing

# Test small q0 values
for q0 in range(2, 20):
    max_n = find_max_n(q0)
    print(f"q0={q0}, max_n={max_n}")

# Find the overall maximum n across all tested q0
max_n_overall = max(find_max_n(q0) for q0 in range(2, 20))
print(f"\nMaximum n found: {max_n_overall}")
```

The program defines a helper function `is_prime_power` to check if a number is a prime power, then implements the sequence generation in `find_max_n`. It tests small starting values `q₀` from 2 to 19 and prints the maximum sequence length `n` for each. Finally, it reports the overall maximum `n` found across all tested starting values.

Note that the mathematical problem likely expects a general proof, but this enumeration helps identify patterns and potential answers for specific cases. The program stops when a term fails to be a prime power, returning the previous valid length.
