[write_program]
This problem asks to find all integers n for which √(n-1) + √(n+1) is rational. We'll write a Python program to search for such n values by checking perfect square conditions.

Key observations:
1. Both √(n-1) and √(n+1) must be rational (since sum of irrationals is irrational)
2. Therefore n-1 and n+1 must both be perfect squares
3. Let n-1 = a² and n+1 = b², then b² - a² = 2
4. This gives (b-a)(b+a) = 2, which has limited integer solutions

```python
def find_n_values(max_n=1000):
    """Find all integers n where sqrt(n-1) + sqrt(n+1) is rational."""
    solutions = []
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        a_squared = n - 1
        b_squared = n + 1
        if a_squared < 0 or b_squared < 0:
            continue
        
        # Check if both are perfect squares
        a = int(a_squared ** 0.5)
        b = int(b_squared ** 0.5)
        if a * a == a_squared and b * b == b_squared:
            r = a + b
            print(f"n = {n}, √({n}-1) + √({n}+1) = {a} + {b} = {r}")
            solutions.append(n)
    
    if solutions:
        print("All found solutions:", solutions)
    else:
        print(f"No solutions found up to n = {max_n}")

find_n_values()
```
