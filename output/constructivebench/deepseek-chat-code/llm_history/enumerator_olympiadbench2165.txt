[write_program]
This problem asks to find all triples of natural numbers (x, y, z) where x ≤ y ≤ z and x³(y³ + z³) = 2012(xyz + 2). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible solutions by:
1. Bounding the search space using inequalities
2. Iterating through possible x, y, z values
3. Checking the equation condition

```python
def solve():
    max_limit = 50  # Empirical upper bound found through testing
    
    for x in range(1, max_limit + 1):
        for y in range(x, max_limit + 1):
            # Calculate z^3 coefficient and constant term
            x3 = x**3
            y3 = y**3
            lhs_coeff = x3
            rhs_coeff = 2012 * x * y
            const_term = 2012 * 2
            
            # Solve for z: x3*y3 + x3*z3 = 2012*x*y*z + 4024
            # Rearranged: x3*z3 - 2012*x*y*z + (x3*y3 - 4024) = 0
            # Try all z >= y up to max_limit
            for z in range(y, max_limit + 1):
                if x3 * (y3 + z**3) == 2012 * (x * y * z + 2):
                    print(f"Found solution: ({x}, {y}, {z})")
    
    print("Search complete up to limit", max_limit)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```
