This problem involves trigonometric identities and finding the maximum value of a certain expression. We'll use Python to explore possible values by enumerating angles and computing the expressions.

Key observations:
1. The given condition is sin(x)cos(y) - sin(y)cos(x) = 1, which simplifies to sin(x-y) = 1
2. The set we're examining is values of z = sin(x)cos(y) + sin(y)cos(x) = sin(x+y)
3. From sin(x-y) = 1, we know x-y = π/2 + 2πk for integer k
4. We can parameterize x and y in terms of a single variable θ

The program will:
1. Sample angles θ in [0, 2π]
2. Set x = θ + π/4 + πk, y = θ - π/4 - πk (from x-y = π/2 + 2πk)
3. Compute z = sin(x+y) = sin(2θ)
4. Track the maximum value found

```python
import math

def find_max_z():
    max_z = -2  # Initialize below minimum possible value
    steps = 1000  # Number of samples for θ
    
    for i in range(steps + 1):
        theta = 2 * math.pi * i / steps
        # Compute z = sin(2θ)
        z = math.sin(2 * theta)
        
        # Print all z values that are candidates for maximum
        if z > max_z - 1e-6:  # Account for floating point precision
            print(f"θ = {theta:.4f}, z = {z:.6f}")
            max_z = max(max_z, z)
    
    print(f"\nMaximum z value found: {max_z:.6f}")

find_max_z()
