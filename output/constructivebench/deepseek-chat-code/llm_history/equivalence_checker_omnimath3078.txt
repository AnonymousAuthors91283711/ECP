Ground Truth Answer: -4
Proposed Answer: (2 - sqrt 5) * (2 + sqrt 5)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines:
   - x = 2
   - y = 2² - 5 = -1
   - z = y² - 5 = (-1)² - 5 = 1 - 5 = -4

2. The ground truth answer is indeed -4, as shown by the calculation above.

3. The proposed answer is (2 - √5)(2 + √5). Let's evaluate this:
   (2 - √5)(2 + √5) = 2² - (√5)² = 4 - 5 = -1
   This equals -1, not -4.

The proposed answer evaluates to -1, which is actually the value of y, not z. Therefore, it's incorrect for the given problem.

<<<False>>>
