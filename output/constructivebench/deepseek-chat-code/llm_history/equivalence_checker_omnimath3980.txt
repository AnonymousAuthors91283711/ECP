Ground Truth Answer: {m : ℕ | Nat.Prime m}
Proposed Answer: {n^2 | n : ℕ}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence `a` where:
   - `a(1) = 2`
   - `a(n+1) = a(n) + l(a(n))` where `l(n)` is the largest prime ≤ n

2. The ground truth answer claims the set of perfect squares in the sequence `a` is exactly the set of prime numbers.

3. The proposed answer claims it's the set of all perfect squares.

Looking at the sequence:
- a(1) = 2 (not a square)
- a(2) = 2 + l(2) = 2 + 2 = 4 (square of 2, which is prime)
- a(3) = 4 + l(4) = 4 + 3 = 7 (not square)
- a(4) = 7 + l(7) = 7 + 7 = 14 (not square)
- a(5) = 14 + l(14) = 14 + 13 = 27 (not square)
- etc.

The only square so far is 4, which is indeed the square of a prime. The proposed answer includes all squares (like 1, 9, 16, 25, etc.) which don't appear in the sequence based on the initial terms.
