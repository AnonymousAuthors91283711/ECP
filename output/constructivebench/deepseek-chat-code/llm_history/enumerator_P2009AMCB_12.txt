This problem involves finding the initial term `a` of a geometric sequence where the 5th term equals 7! and the 8th term equals 8!. We'll solve it by setting up equations based on the geometric sequence formula and finding the ratio `r` first.

The geometric sequence formula is given by: geometric n = a * r^n
From the problem:
1. a * r^5 = 7! = 5040
2. a * r^8 = 8! = 40320

We can divide equation 2 by equation 1 to eliminate `a`:
r^3 = 40320/5040 = 8 ⇒ r = 2

Then substitute r back into equation 1:
a * 2^5 = 5040 ⇒ a = 5040/32 = 157.5

Here's the Python program to verify this:

```python
import math

# Calculate factorials
fact7 = math.factorial(7)  # 5040
fact8 = math.factorial(8)  # 40320

# Solve for r: r^3 = fact8/fact7 = 8
r = 2  # since 2^3 = 8

# Solve for a: a = fact7 / (r^5)
a = fact7 / (r ** 5)

# Output the exact value as a fraction and decimal
print(f"a = {a} (exact: 157.5)")
```
