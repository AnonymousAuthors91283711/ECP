[write_program]
This problem is about finding real numbers r and s such that for all m, the quadratic equation x² = 14 + m(x - 20) has no real solutions if and only if r < m < s, and then computing r + s. We'll write a program to analyze the discriminant condition and find the interval (r, s).

The approach is:
1. Rewrite the equation in standard quadratic form: x² - mx + (20m - 14) = 0
2. The discriminant condition for no real roots is D = m² - 4(20m - 14) < 0
3. Solve the inequality m² - 80m + 56 < 0
4. Find the roots of m² - 80m + 56 = 0 to determine the interval (r, s)

```python
import math

def find_interval():
    # Coefficients of quadratic equation: m² - 80m + 56 = 0
    a = 1
    b = -80
    c = 56
    
    # Calculate discriminant
    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
    
    # Calculate roots
    sqrt_discriminant = math.sqrt(discriminant)
    r = (-b - sqrt_discriminant) / (2*a)
    s = (-b + sqrt_discriminant) / (2*a)
    
    # Print the interval bounds and their sum
    print(f"r = {r}")
    print(f"s = {s}")
    print(f"r + s = {r + s}")

find_interval()
```
