[write_program]
This problem appears to be a placeholder from the Lean theorem prover (Mathlib) asking for a proof about some property `omnimath4414_answer` of natural numbers. Since we don't know what this property represents, we'll create a Python program that enumerates natural numbers and checks some basic properties that might be relevant for competition problems (primality, perfect squares, etc.), printing numbers that satisfy interesting combinations of these properties.

The program will:
1. Iterate through natural numbers n > 0
2. Check various elementary number theory properties
3. Print numbers that satisfy multiple interesting properties
4. Stop after finding the first 20 candidates to avoid excessive output

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n in (2, 3):
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for p in range(3, int(n**0.5)+1, 2):
        if n % p == 0:
            return False
    return True

def is_square(n):
    root = int(n**0.5)
    return root * root == n

def is_fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    while b < n:
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b == n

def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

max_n = 1000  # Reasonable upper bound for demonstration
print("Enumerating numbers with interesting properties (n > 0):")
for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    properties = []
    if is_prime(n):
        properties.append("prime")
    if is_square(n):
        properties.append("perfect square")
    if is_fibonacci(n):
        properties.append("Fibonacci")
    if n == digit_sum(n)**2:
        properties.append("digit sum square")
    
    if len(properties) >= 2:  # At least two interesting properties
        print(f"n = {n}: {', '.join(properties)}")
    
    if n > 20 and len(properties) >= 3:  # Stop after first 20 or if we find very special numbers
        break
```
