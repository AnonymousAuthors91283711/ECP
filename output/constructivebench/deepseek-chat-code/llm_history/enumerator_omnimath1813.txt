This problem involves a left fold operation over a reversed range of numbers from 0 to 2006, applying some operation (denoted by `star`) starting with an initial value of 2007. The goal is to determine the final value after all operations.

Since the exact operation `star` isn't specified, we'll assume it's either addition or multiplication (common operations in such problems). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible operations and see what values they produce for smaller ranges first, to identify a pattern.

```python
def main():
    # Try with smaller ranges first to identify pattern
    for operation in ['add', 'multiply']:
        print(f"\nTesting operation: {operation}")
        for max_n in [5, 10, 15]:  # Test with small sample sizes
            result = max_n
            for n in reversed(range(max_n)):
                if operation == 'add':
                    result += (n + 1)
                elif operation == 'multiply':
                    result *= (n + 1)
            print(f"max_n={max_n}, result={result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program tests two possible operations (addition and multiplication) with small sample sizes to observe the pattern. For each operation, it:
1. Starts with the initial value (max_n)
2. Iterates through the reversed range
3. Applies the operation to accumulate the result
4. Prints the final result for each test case

This approach helps identify whether the operation is likely addition or multiplication, and what pattern emerges in the results. The output can then be used to conjecture the general formula for the original problem with max_n=2007.
