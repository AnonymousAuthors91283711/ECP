This problem involves counting certain binary sequences (paths) with constraints. For parameters n=8 (false) and m=14 (true), we need to count sequences where:
1. Exactly n falses and m trues
2. For every prefix, we never have both an odd number of falses and an odd number of trues

We'll enumerate all possible sequences of length n+m=22 with exactly 8 falses and 14 trues, then count those satisfying the prefix condition.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def count_valid_sequences(n, m):
    total_length = n + m
    false_positions = combinations(range(total_length), n)
    count = 0
    
    for positions in false_positions:
        sequence = [False] * total_length
        for pos in positions:
            sequence[pos] = True
        
        valid = True
        false_count = 0
        true_count = 0
        
        for i in range(total_length):
            if sequence[i]:
                true_count += 1
            else:
                false_count += 1
            
            if (false_count % 2 == 1) and (true_count % 2 == 1):
                valid = False
                break
        
        if valid:
            count += 1
            print(f"Found valid sequence #{count}")
    
    print(f"Total valid sequences for n={n}, m={m}: {count}")
    return count

# Parameters from the problem
n = 8
m = 14
print(f"Counting sequences with n={n} falses and m={m} trues")
count_valid_sequences(n, m)
```
