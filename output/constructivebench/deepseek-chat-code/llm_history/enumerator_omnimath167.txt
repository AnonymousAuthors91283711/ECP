[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest integer n â‰¥ 2 such that 2^(2^n) mod (2^n - 1) is not a power of 4. We'll write a Python program to check values of n sequentially until we find the smallest such n.

The approach:
1. For each n starting from 2 upwards
2. Compute m = 2^n - 1
3. Compute r = pow(2, 2**n, m) using modular exponentiation
4. Check if r is a power of 4 by repeatedly dividing by 4 until we get 1 or a non-multiple of 4
5. The first n where r isn't a power of 4 is our answer

```python
def is_power_of_4(x):
    while x > 1:
        if x % 4 != 0:
            return False
        x = x // 4
    return x == 1

def find_min_n():
    n = 2
    while True:
        m = (1 << n) - 1  # 2^n - 1
        exponent = 1 << n  # 2^n
        r = pow(2, exponent, m)
        print(f"n={n}, r={r}")  # Print intermediate results
        if not is_power_of_4(r):
            print(f"Found minimal n: {n}")
            return n
        n += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_n()
```
