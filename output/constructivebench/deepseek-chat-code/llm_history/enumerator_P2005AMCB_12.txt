This problem involves finding the ratio n/p given certain polynomial root conditions. We'll approach it by:
1. Modeling the quadratic equations and their roots
2. Using Vieta's formulas to establish relationships between coefficients
3. Solving the system of equations to find n/p

The program will:
- Define symbolic variables for the roots
- Set up equations based on Vieta's formulas
- Solve the system to find the ratio n/p

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_ratio():
    # Define symbolic variables
    r, s, m, n, p = symbols('r s m n p')
    
    # First quadratic: x² + p*x + m with roots r,s
    # Vieta's formulas:
    eq1 = Eq(r + s, -p)
    eq2 = Eq(r * s, m)
    
    # Second quadratic: x² + m*x + n with roots 2r,2s
    # Vieta's formulas:
    eq3 = Eq(2*r + 2*s, -m)
    eq4 = Eq(4*r*s, n)
    
    # Solve the system of equations
    solutions = solve([eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4], (m, n, p, r, s))
    
    # Extract the ratio n/p from solutions
    for sol in solutions:
        if sol[1] != 0 and sol[2] != 0:  # Ensure n and p are non-zero
            ratio = sol[1]/sol[2]
            print(f"Found ratio n/p = {ratio}")
            return ratio
