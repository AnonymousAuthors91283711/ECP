[write_program]
The problem asks to count the number of quadruples (a,b,c,d) of positive integers where each divides 30 and their product exceeds 900. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible combinations.

First, we find all positive divisors of 30 (1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30). Then we generate all possible quadruples and count those where the product > 900.

```python
def enumerate_quadruples():
    divisors = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30]
    count = 0
    
    for a in divisors:
        for b in divisors:
            for c in divisors:
                for d in divisors:
                    if a * b * c * d > 900:
                        print(f"Found: ({a}, {b}, {c}, {d})")
                        count += 1
    
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

enumerate_quadruples()
```
