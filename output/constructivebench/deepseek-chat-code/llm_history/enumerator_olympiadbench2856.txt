[write_program]
This problem asks for the greatest real number x such that (log x)^2 - log(√x) = 10. We'll write a Python program to numerically approximate solutions to this equation.

Approach:
1. Rewrite the equation using log properties: (log x)^2 - (1/2)log x = 10
2. Let y = log x, then equation becomes y² - y/2 - 10 = 0
3. Solve quadratic to get y = [1/2 ± √(1/4 + 40)]/2
4. Convert back to x = e^y
5. Find the larger root since we want the greatest x

The program will:
1. Compute both roots of the quadratic
2. Calculate corresponding x values
3. Verify they satisfy original equation
4. Identify the greatest solution

```python
import math

def find_solutions():
    # Coefficients of quadratic: y² - 0.5y - 10 = 0
    a = 1
    b = -0.5
    c = -10
    
    # Calculate discriminant
    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
    
    # Find roots
    y1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
    y2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
    
    # Convert back to x
    x1 = math.exp(y1)
    x2 = math.exp(y2)
    
    # Verify solutions
    def equation(x):
        return (math.log(x))**2 - math.log(math.sqrt(x))
    
    tol = 1e-10
    assert abs(equation(x1) - 10) < tol
    assert abs(equation(x2) - 10) < tol
    
    print(f"Solution 1: x = {x1}")
    print(f"Solution 2: x = {x2}")
    print(f"Greatest solution: {max(x1, x2)}")

find_solutions()
