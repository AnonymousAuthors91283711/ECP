[write_program]
This problem asks for the count of numbers `a` between 1 and 200 such that `a^a` is a perfect square. We'll write a Python program to enumerate these numbers by checking for each `a` whether `a^a` is a perfect square.

Key observations:
1. For `a^a` to be a perfect square, `a` must be either:
   - An even number (since even exponents make perfect squares)
   - An odd perfect square (since odd exponents of perfect squares remain perfect squares)
2. We'll check each number from 1 to 200 to see if it satisfies either condition.

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    """Check if n is a perfect square."""
    root = math.isqrt(n)
    return root * root == n

def is_odd_perfect_square(a):
    """Check if a is an odd perfect square."""
    return a % 2 == 1 and is_perfect_square(a)

count = 0
for a in range(1, 201):
    if a % 2 == 0 or is_odd_perfect_square(a):
        count += 1
        print(a)  # Stream partial results

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
