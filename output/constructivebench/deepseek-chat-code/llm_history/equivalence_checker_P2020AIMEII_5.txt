Ground Truth Answer: 151
Proposed Answer: 2^21 - 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves functions f(n) and g(n) that operate on digits of numbers in different bases (4 and 8 respectively), then looks for the smallest positive integer n where g(n) has a digit ≥10 in base 16.

2. The ground truth answer is 151, which is a specific number that satisfies the conditions.

3. The proposed answer is 2²¹-1, which equals 2,097,151 - a much larger number.

4. While 2²¹-1 might satisfy the condition (having a digit ≥10 in base 16 when processed through g), it's clearly not the smallest such number (as 151 is much smaller).

5. The problem specifically asks for the least number satisfying the condition, so the proposed answer fails this requirement.

<<<False>>>
