theorem omnimath3787 (a b c k : ℕ) :
  (a.Prime ∧ b.Prime ∧ c.Prime ∧ k > 0 ∧ a^2 + b^2 + 16 * c^2 = 9 * k^2 + 1) ↔

Ground Truth Answer: {(3, 3, 2, 3), (3, 37, 3, 13), (37, 3, 3, 13), (3, 17, 3, 7), (17, 3, 3, 7)}
Proposed Answer: {(3, 3, 2, 3), (3, 17, 3, 10), (3, 37, 3, 20), (17, 3, 3, 10), (37, 3, 3, 20)}
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. For (3,3,2,3):
   Both answers include this tuple, and it satisfies the equation:
   3² + 3² + 16*2² = 9 + 9 + 64 = 82
   9*3² + 1 = 81 + 1 = 82

2. For (3,17,3,7) vs (3,17,3,10):
   Ground truth k=7:
   3² + 17² + 16*3² = 9 + 289 + 144 = 442
   9*7² + 1 = 441 + 1 = 442 (correct)
   Proposed k=10:
   9*10² + 1 = 901 ≠ 442 (incorrect)

3. For (3,37,3,13) vs (3,37,3,20):
   Ground truth k=13:
   3² + 37² + 16*3² = 9 + 1369 + 144 = 1522
   9*13² + 1 = 1521 + 1 = 1522 (correct)
   Proposed k=20:
   9*20² + 1 = 3601 ≠ 1522 (incorrect)

The proposed answer has incorrect k values for several tuples, making the solutions invalid. Only the (3,3,2,3) tuple is correct.
