theorem omnimath2785
(a b c : ℝ)
(r : ℝ)
(hsum : a + b + c = 114)
(hprod : a * b * c = 46656)
(hb : b = a * r)
(hc : c = a * r ^ 2)
: a + c = omnimath2785_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solution: a = 24.0, c = 54.0, a + c = 78.0
Solution: a = 54.0, c = 24.0, a + c = 78.0
Negative solution: a = -24.0, c = -54.0, a + c = -78.0
Negative solution: a = -54.0, c = -24.0, a + c = -78.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<78>>>
