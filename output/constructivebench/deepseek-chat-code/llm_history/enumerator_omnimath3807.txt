[write_program]
This problem asks for all positive integer quadruples (x,y,z,t) satisfying the equation 2^x * 3^y + 5^z = 7^t. We'll write a Python program to search for solutions by bounding the exponents and checking all combinations within reasonable limits.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible values of t (up to a reasonable limit)
2. For each t, compute 7^t
3. For each possible z, compute 5^z and subtract from 7^t to get remaining value
4. Check if remaining value can be expressed as 2^x * 3^y
5. Print any valid solutions found

```python
def find_solutions(max_t=10):
    for t in range(1, max_t + 1):
        rhs = 7 ** t
        for z in range(1, max_t + 1):
            pz = 5 ** z
            if pz >= rhs:
                continue
            remaining = rhs - pz
            # Factor remaining into 2^x * 3^y
            x = 0
            y = 0
            temp = remaining
            while temp % 2 == 0:
                x += 1
                temp //= 2
            while temp % 3 == 0:
                y += 1
                temp //= 3
            if temp == 1 and x > 0 and y > 0:
                print(f"Solution found: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, t={t}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Searching for solutions to 2^x * 3^y + 5^z = 7^t...")
    find_solutions()
```
