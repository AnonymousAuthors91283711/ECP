Ground Truth Answer: 90
Proposed Answer: 95
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number x such that when added to the given scores (90,80,70,60,85), the new average of 6 scores is at least 3 points higher than the original average of 5 scores.

2. First, calculate the original average of 5 scores:
   (90 + 80 + 70 + 60 + 85)/5 = 385/5 = 77

3. The new average requirement is: ≥ 77 + 3 = 80

4. So we need to solve for smallest x where:
   (385 + x)/6 ≥ 80
   385 + x ≥ 480
   x ≥ 95

5. The ground truth answer is 90, which would give:
   (385 + 90)/6 ≈ 79.17 < 80 (doesn't meet requirement)

6. The proposed answer is 95, which gives:
   (385 + 95)/6 = 480/6 = 80 (exactly meets requirement)

The proposed answer (95) is correct, while the ground truth answer (90) is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the inequality.
