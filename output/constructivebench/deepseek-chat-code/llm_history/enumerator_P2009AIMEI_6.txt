[write_program]
This problem asks for the count of positive integers N < 1000 where there exists a real x such that x^(floor(x)) = N. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such N values up to 1000.

The approach is:
1. For each possible integer k (floor(x)), compute the range of x values that would produce N in [k^k, (k+1)^k)
2. For each k, generate all integer N values in this range that are < 1000
3. Collect all unique N values and count them

```python
def p2009aimei6():
    max_N = 1000
    results = set()
    
    # We'll handle k=1 separately since 1^1=1 and 2^1=2
    # For k >= 2, we compute the range [k^k, (k+1)^k)
    k = 1
    while True:
        lower = k ** k
        upper = (k + 1) ** k
        
        # Stop when lower bound exceeds max_N
        if lower >= max_N:
            break
            
        # The possible N values are integers in [lower, min(upper, max_N))
        start = int(lower)
        end = int(min(upper, max_N))
        
        # Add all integers in this range
        for N in range(start, end):
            results.add(N)
        
        k += 1
    
    # Sort and print all found N values
    sorted_results = sorted(results)
    for N in sorted_results:
        print(N)
    
    # Print the count
    print(f"Total count: {len(sorted_results)}")
