This problem involves finding the relationship between x and y when two expressions G and G' are equal, with constraints on x and y. We'll enumerate possible values of x and y within the given bounds (-1 < x < y < 1) to find when G = G'.

The approach is:
1. Iterate through possible x values in (-1,1)
2. For each x, iterate through y values in (x,1)
3. Check when x/(1-y) = y/(1-x)
4. Output valid (x,y) pairs and their sum x+y

```python
def main():
    # Use small step size for demonstration, could be adjusted for precision
    step = 0.01
    print("Searching for x and y where x/(1-y) = y/(1-x) with -1 < x < y < 1")
    print("x\t\ty\t\tx+y")
    
    x = -0.99
    while x < 1:
        y = x + step
        while y < 1:
            # Avoid division by zero
            if abs(1 - y) < 1e-9 or abs(1 - x) < 1e-9:
                y += step
                continue
            
            left = x / (1 - y)
            right = y / (1 - x)
            
            # Check equality with some tolerance for floating point
            if abs(left - right) < 1e-6:
                print(f"{x:.4f}\t{y:.4f}\t{x+y:.4f}")
            y += step
        x += step

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
