[write_program]
This problem asks for the largest natural number n such that there exists an integer k where the sum of n consecutive integers starting from k equals 45. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible n values and find the maximum n that satisfies the condition.

The sum of n consecutive integers starting from k is given by the formula: n*k + n*(n-1)/2 = 45. We can rearrange this to solve for k and check if it's an integer.

```python
def find_max_n():
    max_n = 0
    for n in range(1, 100):  # 100 is a safe upper bound
        # Calculate numerator and denominator for k
        numerator = 90 - n * (n - 1)
        denominator = 2 * n
        
        # Check if k is integer
        if numerator % denominator == 0:
            k = numerator // denominator
            print(f"n = {n}, k = {k}")
            max_n = n
    print(f"Maximum n found: {max_n}")

find_max_n()
```
