Ground Truth Answer: fun (a, b, c) => max (max a b) c - min (min a b) c
Proposed Answer: fun ⟨a, b, c⟩ => (a + b + c) / 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
We have three positive natural numbers a, b, c with:
1. a + b = 998
2. a + c = 1050
3. b + c = 1234

We can solve for a, b, c:
- Adding all three equations: 2(a + b + c) = 998 + 1050 + 1234 = 3282
- So a + b + c = 1641
- Then c = 1641 - 998 = 643
- b = 1641 - 1050 = 591
- a = 1641 - 1234 = 407

Ground Truth Answer:
max(max a b)c - min(min a b)c = max(407 591)643 - min(407 591)643
= max(591)643 - min(407)643
= 643 - 407 = 236

Proposed Answer:
(a + b + c)/2 = 1641/2 = 820.5
But this is not an integer, and doesn't match 236.

The proposed answer is completely different from the ground truth answer and doesn't satisfy the problem's requirements.
