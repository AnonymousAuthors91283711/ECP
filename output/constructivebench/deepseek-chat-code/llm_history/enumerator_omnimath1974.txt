[write_program]
This problem involves computing the infinite sum of a geometric series where each term is (9/10)^n * (1/10). The solution can be found using the formula for an infinite geometric series. We'll write a Python program to compute partial sums and observe the convergence.

```python
def compute_partial_sums(terms=20):
    """Compute partial sums of the series (9/10)^n * (1/10)"""
    total = 0.0
    for n in range(terms):
        term = (9/10)**n * (1/10)
        total += term
        print(f"After term {n+1}: {total}")
    
    # Theoretical value (1/10)/(1 - 9/10) = 1
    print("The series appears to converge to 1.0")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_partial_sums()
```
