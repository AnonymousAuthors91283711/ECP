This problem involves finding the value of `c` given five integers in arithmetic progression (with common difference) and their sum being 30. We'll enumerate possible values of `c` by considering the arithmetic progression structure.

The approach:
1. Let the common difference be `k`
2. Express all variables in terms of `c` and `k`: a = c-2k, b = c-k, d = c+k, e = c+2k
3. The sum equation becomes: (c-2k) + (c-k) + c + (c+k) + (c+2k) = 30 → 5c = 30 → c = 6
4. The solution is exact and doesn't require enumeration, but we'll verify it programmatically

```python
def solve():
    # Since it's an arithmetic progression, we can express all terms in terms of c and k
    # The sum simplifies to 5c = 30, so c must be 6
    # We'll verify this by checking possible integer values around this solution
    
    # Check possible c values near the theoretical solution
    for c in range(4, 9):  # Checking a small range around expected answer
        # Verify if 5c equals 30
        if 5 * c == 30:
            print(f"Found solution: c = {c}")
            return
    
    print("No solution found")

solve()
```
