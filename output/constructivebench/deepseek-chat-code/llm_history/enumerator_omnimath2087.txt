[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer `c` such that there exist distinct positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` where:
- 42 divides `a`
- 72 divides `b`
- The triangle inequalities hold: a+b>c, a+c>b, b+c>a

We'll write a Python program to find the minimal `c` by:
1. Iterating `c` from 1 upwards
2. For each `c`, checking possible multiples of 42 for `a` and multiples of 72 for `b`
3. Ensuring all conditions are met (distinctness and triangle inequalities)
4. Stopping at the first valid `c`

```python
def find_min_c():
    c = 1
    while True:
        # Check if there exist a and b satisfying conditions for current c
        # a must be multiple of 42, b multiple of 72, all distinct
        found = False
        # We only need to check a up to c*2 since a + b > c and b >= 72
        max_a = 2 * c + 1
        for a in range(42, max_a, 42):
            # b must be > |a - c| and < a + c (triangle inequalities)
            min_b = max(72, abs(a - c) + 1)
            max_b = a + c - 1
            for b in range((min_b + 71) // 72 * 72, max_b + 1, 72):
                if a != b and b != c and a != c:
                    print(f"Found candidate: c={c} with a={a}, b={b}")
                    return c
        c += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    min_c = find_min_c()
    print(f"Minimal c found: {min_c}")
```
