[write_program]
This problem asks for pairs of positive integers (a, n) where n divides (a+1)^n - a^n. We'll write a Python program to enumerate such pairs efficiently.

Key observations:
1. For any a, n=1 always works since (a+1)^1 - a^1 = 1 is divisible by 1
2. For n=2, the condition becomes (a+1)^2 - a^2 = 2a+1 must be divisible by 2, which means a must be odd
3. We'll limit our search to small values of a and n for demonstration

The program will:
1. Iterate through possible values of a and n
2. Check the divisibility condition
3. Print valid pairs as they're found

```python
def main():
    max_a = 20  # Sample parameter - can be increased
    max_n = 20  # Sample parameter - can be increased
    
    print(f"Searching for pairs (a, n) where n divides (a+1)^n - a^n")
    print(f"Parameters: a up to {max_a}, n up to {max_n}")
    
    for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
        for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
            if ((a + 1)**n - a**n) % n == 0:
                print(f"Found pair: ({a}, {n})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
