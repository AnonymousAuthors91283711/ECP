This problem asks for natural numbers m and n (with m>0, n>1) such that m^n = 2^25 * 3^40, and seeks the minimal m+n. We'll enumerate possible exponents for 2 and 3 in m, then compute n and check the conditions.

```python
def solve():
    # We need m = 2^a * 3^b where a*n=25 and b*n=40
    # So n must divide both 25 and 40
    common_divisors = []
    for n in range(2, 26):  # n>1 and can't exceed 25 (from 25/n)
        if 25 % n == 0 and 40 % n == 0:
            common_divisors.append(n)
    
    min_sum = float('inf')
    for n in common_divisors:
        a = 25 // n
        b = 40 // n
        m = (2 ** a) * (3 ** b)
        current_sum = m + n
        print(f"Found: m={m}, n={n}, m+n={current_sum}")
        if current_sum < min_sum:
            min_sum = current_sum
    
    print(f"Minimal m+n is: {min_sum}")

solve()
```
