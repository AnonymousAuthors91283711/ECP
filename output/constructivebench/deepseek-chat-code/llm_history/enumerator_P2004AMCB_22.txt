This problem involves finding all positive integers g that satisfy a system of equations involving products of variables a through i. The goal is to find the sum of all such g values. We'll approach this by enumerating possible values of g and checking if there exist corresponding values for the other variables that satisfy all conditions.

The key observations are:
1. The conditions imply certain multiplicative relationships between the variables
2. We can limit our search to small values of g since the problem likely has a small solution
3. The conditions are symmetric in certain ways, suggesting g=1 might work

```python
def solve():
    max_g = 100  # Reasonable upper bound for search
    solutions = []
    
    for g in range(1, max_g + 1):
        found = False
        # Try to find variables that satisfy all conditions
        # We'll limit the search space for other variables
        max_other = 20  # Limit for other variables
        
        for a in range(1, max_other):
            for b in range(1, max_other):
