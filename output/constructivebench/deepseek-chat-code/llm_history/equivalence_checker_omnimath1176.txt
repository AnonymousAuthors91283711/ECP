Ground Truth Answer: 63 / 2
Proposed Answer: 45.5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves summing M(a,b,c,d,e,f) mod 64 over all combinations of a,b,c,d,e,f from 1 to 100, then dividing by 100^6.

2. The key observation is that M mod 64 is equivalent to considering only a,b,c,d,e,f mod 64, since higher bits don't affect the result modulo 64.

3. Due to the uniform distribution of numbers mod 64 when taken from 1 to 100 (which is more than one full cycle of 64), each residue modulo 64 appears equally often.

4. The average of all possible M mod 64 values is (63/2), since:
   - The possible M mod 64 values range from 0 to 63
   - The average is (0 + 1 + ... + 63)/64 = (63*64/2)/64 = 63/2

5. The proposed answer is 45.5, which is 91/2, not matching the correct average of 63/2.

The proposed answer is incorrect.
