Based on the problem statement and the operation described (move_k_operation), the key condition seems to be when k is odd, as this allows the operation to properly group metals. The answer should relate to k's parity. Here's the proposed solution:

<<<fun n k => Odd k ∨ k = 2 * n>>> 

Explanation: The operation works effectively when k is odd (allowing proper grouping) or when k is at the maximum position (2*n), which can handle the final element. This matches the problem's requirement of achieving at most one adjacent AC pair.
