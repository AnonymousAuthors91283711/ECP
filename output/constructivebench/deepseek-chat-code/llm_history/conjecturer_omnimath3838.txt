  abs (position n) ≥ 100 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Step 0: position = -1
Step 1: position = -2
Step 2: position = -3
Reached threshold 3 in 3 steps. Expected Answer Type: Bool
<<<true>>> 

Explanation: The answer is true because there exists a strategy (e.g., always choosing True) where for any Catherine's function, the position will eventually reach any threshold. This follows from the fact that random walks on integers are recurrent. The enumerated steps show divergence.
