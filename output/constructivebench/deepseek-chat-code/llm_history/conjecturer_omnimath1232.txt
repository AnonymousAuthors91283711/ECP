theorem omnimath1232 :
  (∀ n ≥ 1, (GCDMonoid.gcd (2002^n + 2) omnimath1232_answer = omnimath1232_answer)) ∧
  (∀ d : ℕ, (∀ n ≥ 1, GCDMonoid.gcd (2002^n + 2) d = d) → d ≤ omnimath1232_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Finding the maximal d that divides 2002^n + 2 for all n ≥ 1
After n=3, current gcd candidate: 6
After n=4, current gcd candidate: 6
After n=5, current gcd candidate: 6

Initial gcd candidate: 6
Found valid divisor: 6

The maximal valid d is: 6. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
