Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated answers, we can observe that all solutions involve at least two factors of 30 (either as c or d) to make the product exceed 900. The pattern shows combinations where smaller divisors (1-15) are paired with 30 to satisfy the condition. Counting all valid permutations gives the solution.
