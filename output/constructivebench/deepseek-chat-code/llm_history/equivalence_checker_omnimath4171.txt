Ground Truth Answer: ∅
Proposed Answer: {(2, 1)}
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find all integer pairs (x,y) where (x⁷-1)/(x-1) = y⁵-1.

2. The left side (x⁷-1)/(x-1) is the sum of a geometric series, equal to 1 + x + x² + ... + x⁶.

3. The ground truth answer is the empty set ∅, meaning there are no integer solutions.

4. The proposed answer suggests {(2,1)} is a solution. Let's test this:
   - For x=2: (2⁷-1)/(2-1) = (128-1)/1 = 127
   - For y=1: 1⁵-1 = 0
   - 127 ≠ 0, so this is not actually a solution.

5. The proposed answer is incorrect as it claims a solution that doesn't satisfy the equation.

6. The ground truth answer of ∅ appears correct since:
   - For x=1, the left side is undefined (0/0)
   - For other integer x values, the left side grows much faster than the right side
   - Testing small integer values shows no valid solutions
