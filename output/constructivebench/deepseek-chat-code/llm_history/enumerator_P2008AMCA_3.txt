[write_program]
This problem involves solving a simple rational equation. The task is to find the value of `P2008AMCA_3_answer` that makes the equation true. We'll write a Python program to verify the solution by cross-multiplying and solving for the unknown variable.

The equation is:
(2/3 * 10) / 8 = (1/2 * 5) / x

We'll solve this symbolically in Python using fractions to maintain exact arithmetic.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve_problem():
    # Left side of the equation: (2/3 * 10) / 8
    left_numerator = Fraction(2, 3) * 10
    left_denominator = 8
    left_value = left_numerator / left_denominator
    
    # Right side numerator: (1/2 * 5)
    right_numerator = Fraction(1, 2) * 5
    
    # Solve for x in left_value = right_numerator / x
    # x = right_numerator / left_value
    x = right_numerator / left_value
    
    print(f"The solution is: {x}")

solve_problem()
```
