This problem involves calculating a probability ratio for pairs of students with certain properties. We'll enumerate the given values and compute the required ratio.

The problem defines:
- 36 students
- Multiples: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
- totalPairs = 36*36
- sameMultiplePairs = sum of k² for k in multiples
- samePersonPairs = sum of k for k in multiples
- The ratio is samePersonPairs / sameMultiplePairs

We'll compute this ratio exactly as a fraction.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    students = 36
    multiples = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    
    # Calculate samePersonPairs (sum of k)
    samePersonPairs = sum(multiples)
    
    # Calculate sameMultiplePairs (sum of k²)
    sameMultiplePairs = sum(k*k for k in multiples)
    
    # Compute the ratio as exact fraction
    ratio = Fraction(samePersonPairs, sameMultiplePairs)
    
    # Print the exact fraction
    print(f"Ratio: {ratio.numerator}/{ratio.denominator}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
