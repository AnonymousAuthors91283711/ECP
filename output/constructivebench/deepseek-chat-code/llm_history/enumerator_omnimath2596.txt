[write_program]
This problem involves counting bijective functions from a 3×3 grid to numbers 0-8 where adjacent grid points (horizontally or vertically) map to numbers that are coprime. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible valid bijections.

The approach:
1. Generate all permutations of numbers 0-8 (bijective mappings)
2. For each permutation, check the adjacency condition
3. Count valid permutations

```python
from itertools import permutations
from math import gcd

def is_valid(grid):
    # Check all horizontal adjacents
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(2):
            a = grid[i][j]
            b = grid[i][j+1]
            if gcd(a+1, b+1) != 1:
                return False
    # Check all vertical adjacents
    for i in range(2):
        for j in range(3):
            a = grid[i][j]
            b = grid[i+1][j]
            if gcd(a+1, b+1) != 1:
                return False
    return True

count = 0
# Iterate through all possible 9! permutations
for p in permutations(range(9)):
    # Convert permutation to 3x3 grid
    grid = [
        [p[0], p[1], p[2]],
        [p[3], p[4], p[5]],
        [p[6], p[7], p[8]]
    if is_valid(grid):
        count += 1
        print(f"Found valid permutation #{count}:")
        for row in grid:
            print(" ".join(map(str, row)))
        print()

print(f"Total valid bijections: {count}")
```
[refine_program]
Let me analyze this problem and the provided program:

Judgement Explanation:
1. The problem asks for counting bijective functions from Fin 3 × Fin 3 → Fin 9 where adjacent grid points (horizontally or vertically) map to numbers whose successors are coprime.
2. The program attempts to solve this by checking all 9! permutations of numbers 0-8 in a 3×3 grid.
3. The main issues are:
   - The program has a syntax error (missing closing bracket for grid initialization)
   - It's extremely inefficient (9! = 362880 permutations)
   - It doesn't find any valid permutations, suggesting either the problem is too restrictive or the implementation is incorrect
4. The problem might have no solutions, but we should verify this with a more efficient approach.

Given these issues, I reject the original program. Here's a corrected version that's more efficient and properly structured:

<<<False>>>

```python
from itertools import permutations
from math import gcd

def is_valid(grid):
    # Check horizontal adjacents
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(2):
            if gcd(grid[i][j]+1, grid[i][j+1]+1) != 1:
                return False
    # Check vertical adjacents
    for j in range(3):
        for i in range(2):
            if gcd(grid[i][j]+1, grid[i+1][j]+1) != 1:
                return False
    return True

count = 0
# We can optimize by fixing one value due to symmetry
fixed = 0
remaining = [x for x in range(9) if x != fixed]

# Try all permutations of remaining numbers
for p in permutations(remaining):
    # Place fixed at (0,0) and fill rest
    grid = [
        [fixed, p[0], p[1]],
        [p[2], p[3], p[4]],
        [p[5], p[6], p[7]]
    ]
    if is_valid(grid):
        count += 1
        print(f"Found valid grid #{count}:")
        for row in grid:
            print(" ".join(map(str, row)))
        print()

print(f"Total valid bijections: {count}")
```

This corrected version:
1. Fixes one value to reduce
