Ground Truth Answer: fun (x, y) => 
    let x1 := x + y
    let x2 := x1 * y
    let y3 := y + 1
    let x4 := x2 + y3
    let x5 := x4 * y3
    let y6 := y3 + 1
    x5
Proposed Answer: fun (n, k) => n * (n + 3 * k - 1) / 2
Let's analyze both answers by evaluating them at the given point (10, 2):

Ground Truth Answer:
1. x1 = 10 + 2 = 12
2. x2 = 12 * 2 = 24
3. y3 = 2 + 1 = 3
4. x4 = 24 + 3 = 27
5. x5 = 27 * 3 = 81
6. y6 = 3 + 1 = 4
Final result: 81 (but problem states should be 340 - this suggests the ground truth answer might be incorrect)

Proposed Answer:
n * (n + 3 * k - 1) / 2 = 10 * (10 + 6 - 1) / 2 = 10 * 15 / 2 = 75 (also doesn't match 340)

However, the problem states the correct answer should be 340 at (10,2), but neither solution gives this result. This suggests there might be an error in the problem statement or expected answer.
