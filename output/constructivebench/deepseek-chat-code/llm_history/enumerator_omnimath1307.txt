The problem is to find the remainder when a very large number is divided by a smaller number. The large number is 10002000400080016003200640128025605121024204840968192, and the divisor is 100020004000800160032. 

To solve this efficiently, we can observe that the large number appears to follow a pattern based on powers of 2. We'll break it down using modular arithmetic properties to compute the remainder without dealing with the full large number directly.

Here's the Python program to compute the remainder:

```python
# The large number can be represented as 100020004000800160032 * 10^18 + 640128025605121024204840968192
# We need to compute (large_num) mod divisor = (divisor * 10^18 + remainder_part) mod divisor
# Which simplifies to remainder_part mod divisor since divisor * 10^18 mod divisor = 0

divisor = 100020004000800160032
remainder_part = 640128025605121024204840968192

result = remainder_part % divisor
print(result)
```

The program calculates the remainder by recognizing that the large number can be split into two parts: one that's a multiple of the divisor (divisor * 10^18) and a remainder part. The modulo operation then simplifies to just the remainder part modulo the divisor. This avoids dealing with extremely large numbers directly.
