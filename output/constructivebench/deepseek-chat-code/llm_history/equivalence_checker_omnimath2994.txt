theorem omnimath2994
  (natalie harpreet jiayin : ℝ)
  (hjiayin : jiayin = 161)
  (havg : (natalie + harpreet + jiayin) / 3 = 171) :
  natalie = omnimath2994_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 176
Proposed Answer: 3 * 171 - 161
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us:
   - jiayin = 161
   - (natalie + harpreet + jiayin)/3 = 171

2. We need to find natalie's value (omnimath2994_answer)

3. From the average equation:
   natalie + harpreet + jiayin = 3 * 171
   natalie + harpreet = 3 * 171 - jiayin
   natalie + harpreet = 3 * 171 - 161

The proposed answer gives exactly this expression (3 * 171 - 161), but this represents natalie + harpreet, not just natalie. The ground truth answer (176) would be correct if harpreet = natalie (making natalie = (3*171-161)/2 = 176), but the problem doesn't state this.

The proposed answer is incorrect because it gives the sum of natalie and harpreet, not natalie alone. Without more information about harpreet, we cannot determine natalie's exact value.
