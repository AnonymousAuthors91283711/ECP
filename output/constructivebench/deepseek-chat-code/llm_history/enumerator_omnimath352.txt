[write_program]
This problem involves finding the value `k` in {1,2,3,4} that maximizes the sum of absolute differences when compared to another value `n` in the same range. The mathematical statement is symmetric in `k` and `n`, so we need to enumerate all pairs to understand the pattern.

We'll write a Python program that:
1. Iterates through all possible values of n from 1 to 4
2. For each n, calculates the sum of absolute differences for each k from 1 to 4
3. Prints the results to help identify the pattern

```python
def main():
    for n in range(1, 5):
        print(f"n = {n}:")
        for k in range(1, 5):
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, 5):
                total += abs(i - k) + abs(i - n)
            print(f"  k = {k}: sum = {total}")
        print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
