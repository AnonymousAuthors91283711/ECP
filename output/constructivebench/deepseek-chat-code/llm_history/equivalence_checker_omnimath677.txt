abbrev omnimath677_answer : ℕ → ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath677 (n : ℕ) (hn : n = 2003) :
  (∑ k in Finset.range (n + 1), if k % 3 = 1 then (Nat.choose n k : ℚ) else 0) = omnimath677_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2^n - 2) / 3
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (2^n + if n % 2 = 0 then 1 else -1) / 3
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is about evaluating a sum of binomial coefficients where k ≡ 1 mod 3, for n=2003. The ground truth answer gives (2^n - 2)/3, while the proposed answer gives (2^n + (-1)^(n+1))/3 (written using if-then-else).

These are actually equivalent for n ≡ 2 mod 3 (which includes n=2003 since 2003 mod 3 = 2):
- For n ≡ 2 mod 3, both answers give (2^n - 2)/3
- However, for other values of n mod 3, they differ:
  - For n ≡ 0 mod 3: ground truth gives (2^n - 2)/3, proposed gives (2^n + 1)/3
  - For n ≡ 1 mod 3: ground truth gives (2^n - 2)/3, proposed gives (2^n - 1)/3

Since the problem specifically asks about n=2003 where they agree, but the answers are given as general functions, they are not equivalent in general.
