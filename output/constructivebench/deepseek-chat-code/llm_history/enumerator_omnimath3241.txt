This problem involves finding the dimension of a vector space of balanced bivariate polynomials with total degree ≤ 2009. A balanced polynomial satisfies a certain integral condition. We'll approach this by:

1. Understanding that balanced polynomials are those whose average value on any circle centered at the origin is zero
2. Recognizing these are precisely the harmonic polynomials (solutions to Laplace's equation)
3. Counting the dimension of harmonic polynomials with degree ≤ 2009

The program will enumerate dimensions for smaller degrees to identify the pattern, then compute the answer for degree 2009.

```python
def compute_dimension(max_degree):
    """Compute dimension of space of harmonic polynomials up to given degree"""
    dimensions = []
    for d in range(max_degree + 1):
        if d == 0:
            dim = 1  # Only constant polynomial 1
        elif d % 2 == 1:
            dim = 2  # Real and imaginary parts of (x + iy)^d
        else:
            dim = 0  # Even degrees >0 have no harmonic polynomials
        dimensions.append(dim)
    return sum(dimensions)

# Print dimensions for small degrees to observe pattern
print("Dimensions for degrees 0-10:")
for d in range(11):
    print(f"Degree {d}: {compute_dimension(d)}")

# Compute answer for problem's degree 2009
result = compute_dimension(2009)
print(f"\nFinal answer for degree 2009: {result}")
```
