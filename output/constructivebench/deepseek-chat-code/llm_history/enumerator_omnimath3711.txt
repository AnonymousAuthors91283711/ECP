[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer k such that there exists a function f from integers to subsets of {1,...,k} where any two integers differing by 5, 7, or 12 must be assigned different subsets. We'll write a program to find the minimal k by testing possible values incrementally.

The approach:
1. For each candidate k starting from 1 upwards
2. Check if a valid coloring exists by modeling this as a graph coloring problem where nodes are integers and edges connect numbers differing by 5, 7, or 12
3. Since the graph is infinite, we'll check a finite window that captures the essential constraints
4. For each k, we'll try to assign colors (subsets) to integers in a way that satisfies the condition

```python
def main():
    from itertools import product

    max_k_to_test = 7  # We'll test up to k=7 since the answer is expected to be small
    window_size = 24    # Large enough to capture dependencies from differences 5,7,12

    for k in range(1, max_k_to_test + 1):
        # Generate all possible colorings for the window
        # Each position can be any subset of {1,...,k}, represented as a bitmask
        num_colors = 1 << k
        for coloring in product(range(num_colors), repeat=window_size):
            valid = True
            # Check all pairs in the window with required differences
            for i in range(window_size):
                for delta in [5, 7, 12]:
                    j = i + delta
                    if j >= window_size:
                        continue
                    if coloring[i] == coloring[j]:
                        valid = False
                        break
                if not valid:
                    break
            if valid:
                print(f"Found valid coloring for k={k}")
                print(f"Minimal k is {k}")
                return

        print(f"No valid coloring found for k={k}")

    print("Tested up to k={max_k_to_test} without finding solution")

    main()
