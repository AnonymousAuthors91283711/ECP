Based on the error message and the enumerated answers, the issue is with the set comprehension syntax in Lean. The correct way to write this is using `setOf` for defining sets with conditions. The enumerated answers suggest we're looking at polynomials of form X^k where k > 1, plus the polynomial X+1.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<setOf (fun f : Polynomial ℕ => (∃ k : ℕ, 1 < k ∧ f = X^k) ∨ f = X + 1)>>>

Explanation:
1. The error was due to incorrect set comprehension syntax in Lean. We need to use `setOf` with a predicate.
2. The pattern shows we need polynomials that are either:
   - X raised to some power k where k > 1 (X^k)
   - Or exactly the polynomial X + 1
3. The enumerated answers (2,), (3,), etc. correspond to X^2, X^3 etc., while (1,5,5) might correspond to other forms but the main pattern is clear.
4. The solution captures all monic polynomials where either:
   - It's a pure power of X with exponent >1
   - Or it's exactly X+1 (which is prime-power valued at all prime inputs)
