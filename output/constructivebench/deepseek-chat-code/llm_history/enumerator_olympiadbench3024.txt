[write_program]
This problem involves finding a natural number K that satisfies several conditions when T=55. The conditions involve inequalities and a geometric progression relationship. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible K values and check the conditions.

Key observations:
1. T is fixed at 55, so T-5=50
2. There's a geometric progression: 20*r = 50 and 50*r = K
3. K must satisfy several inequalities and an arithmetic progression condition

```python
def main():
    T = 55
    T_minus_5 = T - 5
    
    # First condition: 20 < 50 < K
    min_K = T_minus_5 + 1
    
    # From geometric progression: 20*r = 50 => r = 2.5
    # Then K = 50 * 2.5 = 125
    K_candidate = 125
    
    # Check all conditions for this candidate
    # 1. 20 < 50 < 125
    condition1 = (20 < T_minus_5) and (T_minus_5 < K_candidate)
    
    # 2. Geometric progression conditions
    r = (T_minus_5) / 20
    condition2 = (r > 1) and (20 * r == T_minus_5) and (T_minus_5 * r == K_candidate)
    
    # 3. 19 < K < 4*T + 11 (which is 231)
    condition3 = (19 < K_candidate) and (K_candidate < 4*T + 11)
    
    # 4. Arithmetic progression condition
    # Find d such that 19 + d = K and K + d = 231
    d = K_candidate - 19
    condition4 = (d > 0) and (19 + d == K_candidate) and (K_candidate + d == 4*T + 11)
    
    if condition1 and condition2 and condition3 and condition4:
        print(f"Found valid K: {K_candidate}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
