Ground Truth Answer: {⟨√30 / 3, √30 / 4, 2 * √30 / 5⟩, ⟨√30 / 3, √30 / 2, √30 / 5⟩}
Proposed Answer: {abc : ℝ × ℝ × ℝ | let ⟨a, b, c⟩ := abc; 
    (a ∈ Set.Ioo 1 2 ∧ b = 2/a ∧ c = 3/a) ∨ 
    (a ∈ Set.Ioo 1 2 ∧ b = 3/a ∧ c = 2/a)}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

The problem is asking for all positive real triples (a,b,c) where:
1. floor(a)*b*c = 3
2. a*floor(b)*c = 4
3. a*b*floor(c) = 5

Ground Truth Answer provides two specific solutions:
1. (√30/3, √30/4, 2√30/5)
2. (√30/3, √30/2, √30/5)

Proposed Answer gives a set description with two cases:
1. a ∈ (1,2), b = 2/a, c = 3/a
2. a ∈ (1,2), b = 3/a, c = 2/a

Let's verify if the ground truth solutions match the proposed form:

First solution (√30/3, √30/4, 2√30/5):
- a = √30/3 ≈ 1.825 ∈ (1,2)
- b = 2/a ≈ 1.095 (but √30/4 ≈ 1.369)
This doesn't match either case in the proposed answer.

Second solution (√30/3, √30/2, √30/5):
- a = √30/3 ≈ 1.825 ∈ (1,2)
- b = 3/a ≈ 1.643 (but √30/2 ≈ 2.739)
This also doesn't match.

The proposed answer seems to be suggesting simpler relationships that don't actually satisfy the original equations when floor functions are considered. The ground truth solutions were carefully derived to satisfy all conditions including the floor function constraints, while the proposed answer provides a simpler but incorrect characterization.
