Ground Truth Answer: 2500
Proposed Answer: 2472
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem calculates total steps (44 * 100000 + 50000 = 4,450,000 steps)
2. It converts steps to miles using 1800 steps/mile (4,450,000 / 1800 ≈ 2472.222...)
3. The theorem states that the answer should be the integer closest to this value
4. The ground truth answer is 2500
5. The proposed answer is 2472

Now let's check which is closer to 2472.222...:
- Distance to 2472: |2472.222 - 2472| ≈ 0.222
- Distance to 2500: |2472.222 - 2500| ≈ 27.778

Clearly, 2472 is much closer to the actual value than 2500. The ground truth answer appears to be incorrect, while the proposed answer is correct.

<<<False>>>
