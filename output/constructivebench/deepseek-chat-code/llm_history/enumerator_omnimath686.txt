[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of distinct real numbers c such that f(f(f(f(c)))) = 3, where f(x) = x² - 2x. We'll write a Python program to find all real solutions by iteratively applying f and solving the equation at each step.

The approach is:
1. Start with the final equation f⁴(c) = 3
2. Work backwards through each application of f
3. At each step, solve the current equation and keep track of all distinct real roots
4. Count the total number of distinct solutions

```python
import math

def f(x):
    return x**2 - 2*x

def find_solutions():
    # Start with the target value 3
    solutions = {3}
    
    # Apply f inverse 4 times
    for _ in range(4):
        new_solutions = set()
        for y in solutions:
            # Solve x^2 - 2x = y
            discriminant = 4 + 4*y
            if discriminant >= 0:
                x1 = (2 + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
                x2 = (2 - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
                new_solutions.add(x1)
                new_solutions.add(x2)
        solutions = new_solutions
    
    # Filter out complex solutions (though discriminant check should prevent them)
    real_solutions = [x for x in solutions if isinstance(x, float)]
    
    # Remove duplicates considering floating point precision
    unique_solutions = []
    seen = set()
    for x in sorted(real_solutions):
        rounded = round(x, 10)
        if rounded not in seen:
            seen.add(rounded)
            unique_solutions.append(x)
    
    # Print all unique solutions
    for sol in unique_solutions:
        print(sol)
    
    # Print the count
    print(f"Total distinct real solutions: {len(unique_solutions)}")

find_solutions()
```
