[write_program]
This problem asks to compute the sum of cubes from 1^3 to 4^3. The solution is straightforward and can be computed directly. We'll write a Python program that calculates this sum and prints it.

```python
# Calculate the sum of cubes from 1^3 to 4^3
sum_of_cubes = sum(i**3 for i in range(1, 5))
print(sum_of_cubes)
```
