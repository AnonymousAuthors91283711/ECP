[write_program]
This problem asks for a 4-digit number x (1000 ≤ x ≤ 9999) that satisfies:
1. x can be expressed as ABAB where A and B are its digits (A ≠ 0)
2. x = n² + 1 for some integer n
3. The digits A and B must appear in x (which is already implied by ABAB format)

We'll write a Python program to find all such numbers by:
1. Iterating through possible A (1-9) and B (0-9)
2. Constructing x in ABAB format (1000*A + 100*B + 10*A + B)
3. Checking if x-1 is a perfect square

```python
def find_omnimath3585_candidates():
    for a in range(1, 10):  # A can't be 0
        for b in range(0, 10):
            x = 1000 * a + 100 * b + 10 * a + b  # ABAB format
            if 1000 <= x <= 9999:
                n_squared = x - 1
                n = int(n_squared ** 0.5)
                if n * n == n_squared:
                    print(x)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_omnimath3585_candidates()
```
