Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
From the enumerated solutions, we can observe that the function counts the exponent of a prime p in the factorization of n, multiplied by a constant a. The pattern shows f(n) = a * (exponent of p in n's prime factorization). 

<<<fun a p n => if n = 0 then 0 else a * (padicValNat p n)>>>
