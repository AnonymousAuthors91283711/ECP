[write_program]
This problem involves solving for a, b, and c given logarithmic equations and then finding their sum. We'll write a Python program to compute these values numerically and verify the sum.

The key steps are:
1. Solve each equation for a, b, c using logarithmic identities
2. Compute each term numerically
3. Sum them up to find the answer

We'll use Python's math library for logarithmic calculations and precise floating-point arithmetic.

```python
import math

def solve():
    # Compute a using a^(log7/log3) = 27
    log7 = math.log(7)
    log3 = math.log(3)
    exponent_a = log7 / log3
    a = 27 ** (1 / exponent_a)
    
    # Compute b using b^(log11/log7) = 49
    log11 = math.log(11)
    exponent_b = log11 / math.log(7)
    b = 49 ** (1 / exponent_b)
    
    # Compute c using c^(log25/log11) = sqrt(11)
    log25 = math.log(25)
    exponent_c = log25 / log11
    c = math.sqrt(11) ** (1 / exponent_c)
    
    # Print intermediate values
    print(f"a = {a}")
    print(f"b = {b}")
    print(f"c = {c}")
    
    # Compute and print the sum
    total = a + b + c
    print(f"a + b + c = {total}")

solve()
```
