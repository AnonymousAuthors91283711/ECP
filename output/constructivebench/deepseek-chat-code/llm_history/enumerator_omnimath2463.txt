[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of binary sequences of length 10 where:
1. No two consecutive 0s appear
2. No three consecutive 1s appear

We'll enumerate all valid sequences of length 10 using dynamic programming to count the valid sequences efficiently. The approach tracks the last one or two digits to enforce the constraints.

```python
def count_sequences(n):
    # dp0[i] = sequences of length i ending with 0
    # dp1[i] = sequences of length i ending with 1
    # dp2[i] = sequences of length i ending with 11
    dp0 = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp1 = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp2 = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Base cases
    dp0[1] = 1  # "0"
    dp1[1] = 1  # "1"
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # Can add 0 after either 1 or 11
        dp0[i] = dp1[i-1] + dp2[i-1]
        # Can add 1 after 0
        dp1[i] = dp0[i-1]
        # Can add 1 after single 1 (but not after 11)
        dp2[i] = dp1[i-1]
    
    # Total is sum of all possible endings
    return dp0[n] + dp1[n] + dp2[n]

n = 10
print(f"Number of valid binary sequences of length {n}: {count_sequences(n)}")
```
