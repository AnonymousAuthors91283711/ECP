This problem asks for the smallest natural number n such that there exists a sequence of n natural numbers k₁, k₂, ..., kₙ where the sum of kᵢ * 35 for all i is at least 500. We need to find the minimal n where such a sequence exists.

The solution approach is:
1. For each n starting from 1 upwards, check if it's possible to reach ≥500 with n terms of kᵢ*35
2. The minimal case occurs when all kᵢ = 1 (since larger kᵢ would only make the sum larger)
3. So for each n, check if n*35 ≥ 500
4. The smallest n satisfying this is ceil(500/35)

Here's the Python program to find this minimal n:

```python
def find_min_n():
    target = 500
    multiplier = 35
    n = 1
    while True:
        # Check if n terms of minimal k_i=1 can reach target
        if n * multiplier >= target:
            print(f"Found minimal n: {n}")
            return
        n += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_n()
```
