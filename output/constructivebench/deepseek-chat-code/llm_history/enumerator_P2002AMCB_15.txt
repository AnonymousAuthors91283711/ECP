The problem asks for all 4-digit numbers N (1000 ≤ N < 10000) where the quotient when N is divided by 10 equals 9 times the remainder when N is divided by 1000. We need to enumerate all such numbers.

Let's break it down:
1. N is a 4-digit number: 1000 ≤ N < 10000
2. N/10 = 9*(N%1000)
   - N/10 is the number formed by removing the last digit
   - N%1000 is the last 3 digits

We'll iterate through all possible 4-digit numbers and check the condition.

```python
def solve():
    count = 0
    for N in range(1000, 10000):
        quotient = N // 10
        remainder = N % 1000
        if quotient == 9 * remainder:
            print(N)
            count += 1
    print(f"Total numbers found: {count}")

solve()
```
