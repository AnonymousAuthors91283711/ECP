[write_program]
This problem asks for positive integer solutions (a,b,c,d) to the equation a³ + b⁴ + c⁵ = d¹¹ with the constraint a*b*c < 100,000. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such solutions.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible values of c (smallest exponent, likely largest values)
2. For each c, iterate through possible b values
3. For each (b,c) pair, compute possible a values
4. Check if a³ + b⁴ + c⁵ is an 11th power
5. Ensure all variables are positive and a*b*c < 100,000

```python
import math

def find_solutions():
    solutions = []
    max_abc = 10**5
    
    # c has largest exponent, so limit it first
    max_c = int((max_abc)**(1/3))  # conservative upper bound
    for c in range(1, max_c + 1):
        c5 = c**5
        
        # b has next largest exponent
        max_b = int((max_abc / c)**0.5)  # since a >=1, b <= sqrt(max_abc/c)
        for b in range(1, max_b + 1):
            b4 = b**4
            
            # a has smallest exponent
            max_a = max_abc // (b * c)
            for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
                a3 = a**3
                total = a3 + b4 + c5
                
                # Check if total is an 11th power
                d = round(total ** (1/11))
                if d**11 == total:
                    solutions.append((a, b, c, d))
                    print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}")
    
    if solutions:
        print("\nAll solutions found:")
        for sol in sorted(solutions):
            print(sol)
    else:
        print("No solutions found")

find_solutions()
```
