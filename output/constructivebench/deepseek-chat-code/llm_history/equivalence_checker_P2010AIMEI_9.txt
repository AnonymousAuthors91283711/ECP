Ground Truth Answer: 158 / 7
Proposed Answer: 28 * (2/7)^(1/3) + 28 * (6/7)^(1/3) + 28 * (20/7)^(1/3)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves finding the maximum value of s = a³ + b³ + c³ under given constraints involving a, b, c.

2. The ground truth answer is a simple fraction: 158/7 ≈ 22.5714

3. The proposed answer is a more complex expression involving cube roots: 28 * (2/7)^(1/3) + 28 * (6/7)^(1/3) + 28 * (20/7)^(1/3)

Let's evaluate the proposed answer numerically:
- (2/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6598
- (6/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.9535
- (20/7)^(1/3) ≈ 1.4106
- 28*(0.6598 + 0.9535 + 1.4106) ≈ 28*3.0239 ≈ 84.6692

This is clearly different from 158/7 ≈ 22.5714. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth numerically, and the form is also completely different.
