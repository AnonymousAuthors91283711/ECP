Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Looking at the numerical samples, the probability appears to converge around 0.589. This suggests the exact value might be 1 - 1/π, since 1 - 1/π ≈ 0.6817 is too high, but 1 - 1/(2π) ≈ 0.8409 is also too high. The closest simple fraction is 5/9 ≈ 0.555..., but the samples are higher. The actual answer likely involves a more complex expression.

<<<1 - Real.exp (-1)>>>
