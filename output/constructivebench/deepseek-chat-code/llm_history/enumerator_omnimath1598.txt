[write_program]
The problem appears to be about finding the floor of the expected value of some function divided by 10, with parameters 8 and 1000. Since we don't have the exact problem statement, we'll assume it's about finding the expected number of some combinatorial structure (like permutations or combinations) with given constraints.

We'll write a Python program that:
1. Simulates or calculates expected values for smaller parameters first to detect patterns
2. Gradually increases parameters to approach the target (8, 1000)
3. Outputs intermediate results to help conjecture the answer

```python
import math
from itertools import combinations
from random import sample
from statistics import mean

def simulate_expected_value(n, k, trials=10000):
    """Monte Carlo simulation for smaller parameters"""
    results = []
    universe = list(range(n))
    for _ in range(trials):
        # Randomly select k elements and count some property
        # This is a placeholder - adjust based on actual problem
        selected = sample(universe, k)
        # Example property: number of pairs where first < second
        count = sum(1 for i, j in combinations(selected, 2) if i < j)
        results.append(count)
    return mean(results)

def main():
    # Test small parameters first to detect patterns
    test_params = [(3,5), (4,10), (5,20), (6,50), (7,100), (8,1000)]
    
    for n, k in test_params:
        if n <= 6 and k <= 50:
            # Calculate exact expected value for small cases
            # This is a placeholder - replace with actual calculation
            # Example: expected number of increasing pairs in k-subset of n elements
            total_pairs = math.comb(n, 2)
            prob = math.comb(k, 2) / math.comb(n, 2)
            expected = total_pairs * prob
        else:
            # Use simulation for larger cases
            expected = simulate_expected_value(n, k)
        
        result = math.floor(expected / 10)
        print(f"For (n,k)=({n},{k}): floor(E/10) = {result}")
    
    # After testing patterns, output the target case separately
    n, k = 8, 1000
    # Since k > n, we need to handle this case specially
    # Assuming the problem is about expected count of some property
    # Here's a placeholder calculation - replace with actual logic
    if k >= n:
        expected = k * (k - 1) / 2  # Example formula
    result = math.floor(expected / 10)
    print(f"\nFinal answer for (8,1000): floor(E/10) = {result}")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
