[write_program]
This problem asks for the largest 5-digit number divisible by 36 with all even digits and no repeating digits. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such numbers and find the maximum.

The approach:
1. Generate all 5-digit numbers divisible by 36 (must be divisible by both 4 and 9)
2. Check that all digits are even (0,2,4,6,8)
3. Check that all digits are distinct
4. Track the maximum valid number found

```python
def solve():
    max_num = 0
    # Iterate through all 5-digit numbers divisible by 36
    for n in range(10000, 100000, 36):
        digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]
        # Check all digits are even and unique
        if all(d % 2 == 0 for d in digits) and len(set(digits)) == 5:
            print(n)  # Stream partial results
            if n > max_num:
                max_num = n
    print("Maximum valid number:", max_num)

solve()
```
