Based on the problem statement and the enumerated roots, we can observe that the sum of cubes of the roots of the polynomial X³ - X + 1 equals -3 (approximated as -2.999... in the enumeration). The theorem requires the answer to be -2, but the actual sum of cubes is -3. This suggests the answer should be the sum of cubes minus 1, or perhaps there's a different pattern. However, given the exact sum of cubes formula for roots of x³ - x + 1, the correct answer is indeed the sum of cubes.
