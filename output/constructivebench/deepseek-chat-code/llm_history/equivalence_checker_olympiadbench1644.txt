Ground Truth Answer: fun m n => m * n - (m / 2)
Proposed Answer: fun m n => m * n + m * (m - 1) / 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed on a grid with certain constraints. The dominoes can be either horizontal or vertical, with specific placement rules.

2. The ground truth answer is `m * n - (m / 2)`, which suggests:
   - A base of m*n (likely representing all possible positions)
   - Subtracting m/2 (likely accounting for some overlap or constraints)

3. The proposed answer is `m * n + m * (m - 1) / 2`, which:
   - Starts with the same m*n base
   - Adds an additional term that grows quadratically with m

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It adds terms instead of subtracting
- The additional term doesn't match the problem's constraints
- For m ≤ n, the proposed answer would often exceed reasonable bounds (especially when m approaches n)

For example, let's test with m=2, n=3:
- Ground truth: 2*3 - (2/2) = 6 - 1 = 5
- Proposed: 2*3 + 2*1/2 = 6 + 1 = 7
The proposed answer is larger, which contradicts the constraints in the problem.
