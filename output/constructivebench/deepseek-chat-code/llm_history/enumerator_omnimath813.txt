This problem asks for the smallest positive integer k such that the polynomial X^10 + X^9 + X^6 + X^5 + X^4 + X + 1 divides X^k - 1. We need to find the minimal k where this occurs.

The approach is to:
1. Represent the polynomial and compute X^k - 1 modulo it
2. Check for the smallest k where the remainder is zero
3. Since we're working over integers, we'll use exact arithmetic

We'll implement polynomial division and remainder calculation, then check remainders for increasing k values until we find the minimal solution.

```python
def polynomial_mod(a, b):
    """Compute a mod b where a and b are polynomials represented as lists of coefficients"""
    while len(a) >= len(b):
        if len(b) == 0:
            return []
        ratio = a[-1] // b[-1]
        degree_diff = len(a) - len(b)
        subtractor = [0]*degree_diff + [x*ratio for x in b]
        a = [a[i] - subtractor[i] for i in range(len(a))]
        while len(a) > 0 and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
    return a

    divisor = [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
    
    k = 1
    while True:
        # Create X^k - 1 polynomial: [-1] + [0]*(k-1) + [1] if k > 0
        dividend = [-1] + [0]*(k-1) + [1]
        remainder = polynomial_mod(dividend, divisor)
        if not remainder:  # empty remainder means exact division
            print(f"Found k = {k}")
            return k
        k += 1
        if k > 1000:  # safety limit
            print("Reached limit without finding solution")
            return None
