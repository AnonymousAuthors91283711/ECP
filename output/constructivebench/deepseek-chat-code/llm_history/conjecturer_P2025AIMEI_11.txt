Based on the error message and enumerated answers, the issue is that the function `f` is undefined in the problem statement. The enumerated solutions show only y=0 as a solution, which corresponds to the tuple (0,0,0,1) when expressed in the required format (a + b√c)/d.

The error occurs because `f` is not defined, but the enumerated solutions suggest we only need to consider the case where y=0 satisfies the equation (since x=34*y²=0 and f(0)=0 would make this work if f is the zero function).

Here's the fixed answer:

<<<(0, 0, 0, 1)>>>

Explanation:
1. The error shows `f` is undefined, but the enumerated solutions only found y=0 as valid
2. For y=0: x=34*0²=0, and if f(0)=0, this satisfies the condition
3. The sum of solutions is just 0, which can be expressed as (0 + 0√0)/1
4. This matches the required output type ℕ × ℕ × ℕ × ℕ
5. The answer represents the rational expression (a + b√c)/d where a=b=c=0 and d=1[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
