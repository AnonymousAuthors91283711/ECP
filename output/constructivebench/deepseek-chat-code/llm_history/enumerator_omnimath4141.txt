[write_program]
This problem asks to find all natural numbers n for which there exist natural numbers a and b (with b > n) such that (a² + n²) is divisible by (b² - n²) and (b² - n²) is positive. We'll write a Python program to enumerate such n values up to a reasonable threshold.

The approach:
1. Iterate n from 1 to a threshold (we'll use 100)
2. For each n, search for b values from n+1 up to a reasonable limit
3. For each b, check if (b² - n²) divides (a² + n²) for some a
4. We'll optimize by noting that a must satisfy a² ≡ -n² mod (b² - n²)

```python
def find_valid_n(max_n=100):
    results = set()
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        found = False
        max_b = 2 * n  # Initial search range
        # Try small b values first
        for b in range(n + 1, max_b + 1):
            denom = b * b - n * n
            if denom <= 0:
                continue
            # We need a² ≡ -n² mod denom
            rhs = (-n * n) % denom
            # Check if rhs is quadratic residue mod denom
            # Try small a values first
            max_a = int((denom)**0.5) + 2
            for a in range(0, max_a + 1):
                if (a * a) % denom == rhs:
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if found:
            results.add(n)
            print(n)
    print("Found n values up to", max_n, ":", sorted(results))

find_valid_n()
```
