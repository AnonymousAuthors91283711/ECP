[write_program]
This problem involves finding a relationship between variables x, y, and z with given proportional constraints. We'll write a Python program to explore the relationship numerically and symbolically.

The problem states:
1. x = 0.2 * y
2. x = 0.5 * z
And asks to express z in terms of y with some coefficient (omnimath3469_answer/100).

We can solve this algebraically by substitution, but we'll write a program to verify the relationship numerically for various y values.

```python
def enumerate_relationships():
    # We'll test with various y values to verify the relationship
    test_values = [1, 2, 5, 10, 100, 1000]
    
    print("Testing with various y values:")
    for y in test_values:
        x = 0.2 * y
        z = x / 0.5
        ratio = z / y
        print(f"y = {y}: z/y = {ratio}")
    
    # The algebraic solution would be:
    # From x = 0.2*y and x = 0.5*z, we get 0.2*y = 0.5*z
    # Therefore z = (0.2/0.5)*y = 0.4*y
    # So omnimath3469_answer/100 = 0.4 => omnimath3469_answer = 40
    # But we won't print this conclusion as per requirements

enumerate_relationships()
```
