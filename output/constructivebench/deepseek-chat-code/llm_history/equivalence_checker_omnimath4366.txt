Ground Truth Answer: { (x, y, z) | x = y ∧ y = z }
Proposed Answer: { (x, y, z) : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ | x = y ∧ y = z ∧ x > 0 }
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer because:
1. Both specify that x = y = z (the core condition)
2. The problem statement already includes the constraints x > 0, y > 0, z > 0
3. The additional x > 0 in the proposed answer is redundant but doesn't change the solution set since it's already implied by the problem's hypotheses
4. Both answers correctly capture all and only the triples where all three numbers are equal positive integers
