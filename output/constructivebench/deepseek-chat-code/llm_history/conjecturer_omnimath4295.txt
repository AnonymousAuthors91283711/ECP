Testing linear functions...
Found linear solution: f(x) = 2x + -1
Found linear solution: f(x) = -1x + -1

Testing quadratic functions...
Found quadratic solution: f(x) = 0x^2 + -1x + -1
Found quadratic solution: f(x) = 0x^2 + 2x + -1
Found quadratic solution: f(x) = 1x^2 + 0x + -1. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
From the enumerated solutions, we see three distinct patterns:
1. f(x) = x² - 1
2. f(x) = 2x - 1
3. f(x) = -x - 1

These satisfy the functional equation f(x+y) + f(x)f(y) = f(xy) + 2xy + 1. The answer is the set containing these three functions.
