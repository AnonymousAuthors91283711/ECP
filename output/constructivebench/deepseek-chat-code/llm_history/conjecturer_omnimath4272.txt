theorem omnimath4272 (n : ℕ) (hn : n > 0) :
  (∃ m, ∑ d ∈ divisors n, d = 2^m) → omnimath4272_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking numbers up to 1000 where sum of divisors is a power of 2:
n = 1, sum of divisors = 1 = 2^0
n = 3, sum of divisors = 4 = 2^2
n = 7, sum of divisors = 8 = 2^3
n = 21, sum of divisors = 32 = 2^5
n = 31, sum of divisors = 32 = 2^5
n = 93, sum of divisors = 128 = 2^7
n = 127, sum of divisors = 128 = 2^7
n = 217, sum of divisors = 256 = 2^8
n = 381, sum of divisors = 512 = 2^9
n = 651, sum of divisors = 1024 = 2^10
n = 889, sum of divisors = 1024 = 2^10. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → Prop
<<<fun n : ℕ => ∃ k, n = 2^k - 1 ∨ n = (2^k - 1) * (2^(k + 1) - 1) / 3 ∨ n = (2^k - 1) * (2^(k - 1) + 1)>>>
