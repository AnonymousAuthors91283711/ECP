Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
Looking at the pattern from the enumerated answers:
- For k=1, n=1 → 1 (1*1)
- For k=1, n=2 → 3 (1*3)
- For k=1, n=3 → 5 (1*5)
- For k=2, n=2 → 6 (2*3)
- For k=2, n=3 → 10 (2*5)
- For k=3, n=2 → 6 (3*2)
The pattern suggests the answer is k*(2n-1) when k ≤ n, and n*(2k-1) when n ≤ k.

<<<fun k n => if k ≤ n then k * (2 * n - 1) else n * (2 * k - 1)>>>
