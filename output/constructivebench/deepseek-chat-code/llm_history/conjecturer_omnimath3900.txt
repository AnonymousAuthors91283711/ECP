theorem omnimath3900 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ x, (f x).divisors.card = x) ∧ 
  (∀ x y, f (x * y) ∣ (x - 1) * y^(x * y - 1) * f x) 
  ↔ f = omnimath3900_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: f(1) = 1
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Based on the problem statement and enumerated answer, the function must satisfy two conditions:
1. The number of divisors of f(x) equals x
2. A divisibility condition involving f(x*y)

The simplest function satisfying f(1)=1 and the divisor count condition is the identity function, since d(1)=1. Testing this against the second condition shows it works when x=1. The pattern suggests the identity function is the solution.
