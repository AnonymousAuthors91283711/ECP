The problem is about finding a specific term in a sequence where the average of the first n terms equals n for all positive n. We need to find the 2008th term. The mathematical approach would involve deriving the general formula for the sequence from the given condition.

Here's a Python program that:
1. Computes the sequence terms up to a reasonable limit (we'll use 2010)
2. Verifies the average condition for each term
3. Prints the sequence terms and their partial sums
4. Finally outputs the 2008th term

```python
def compute_sequence(max_n):
    # Initialize sequence and partial sums
    seq = [0]  # seq[0] is unused since n starts at 1
    partial_sums = [0]
    
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        # Calculate next term based on average condition
        next_term = n * n - partial_sums[n-1]
        seq.append(next_term)
        partial_sums.append(partial_sums[n-1] + next_term)
        
        # Verify the average condition holds
        avg = partial_sums[n] // n
        if avg != n:
            print(f"Error at n={n}: avg={avg} != {n}")
            return
        
        # Print every 100 terms for monitoring
        if n % 100 == 0 or n == max_n:
            print(f"seq[{n}] = {seq[n]}")
    
    # Output the requested term
    print(f"\nFinal answer: seq[2008] = {seq[2008]}")

# Compute up to 2010 to include 2008
compute_sequence(2010)
```
