[write_program]
This problem appears to be a simple arithmetic calculation that evaluates to 1. The equation is (2 * (1/3) * 3 * (1/2)), which simplifies to 1 through cancellation. Since the problem asks for exact values, we'll compute this directly in Python.

```python
# Compute the exact value of 2*(1/3)*3*(1/2)
result = 2 * (1/3) * 3 * (1/2)
print(result)  # Outputs 1.0 (exact value)
```
