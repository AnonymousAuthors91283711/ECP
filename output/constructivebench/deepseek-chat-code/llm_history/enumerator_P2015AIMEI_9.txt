This problem is about counting the number of integer sequences (s_n) where:
1. The first three terms satisfy 1 ≤ s_i ≤ 10 for i=1,2,3
2. There exists some n ≥ 3 where s_n = 0 (the sequence eventually hits 0)
3. The sequence follows the recurrence s_{k+1} = |s_k - s_{k-2}|

We'll enumerate all possible initial triples (s₁, s₂, s₃) and check which ones eventually reach 0. Since the values are bounded and the recurrence involves absolute differences, the sequences must eventually become periodic or reach 0.

```python
def reaches_zero(a, b, c):
    seen = set()
    while True:
        if c == 0:
            return True
        # Check for cycles (if we've seen this state before)
        state = (a, b, c)
        if state in seen:
            return False
        seen.add(state)
        # Compute next term
        a, b, c = b, c, abs(c - a)

count = 0
for s1 in range(1, 11):
    for s2 in range(1, 11):
        for s3 in range(1, 11):
            if reaches_zero(s1, s2, s3):
                count += 1
                print(f"Found valid triple: ({s1}, {s2}, {s3})")
print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
