[write_program]
The problem asks to find the value of `square 0 2` in a 3x3 magic square with specific constraints. The square must contain odd numbers between 5 and 21, with rows, columns, and both diagonals summing to 33 (3*11). Some cells are fixed: (0,0)=5, (1,1)=9, (2,0)=17.

We'll enumerate all possible values for the remaining cells while respecting the constraints. The program will systematically check possible values for each cell, ensuring all sums are correct.

```python
def is_odd(n):
    return n % 2 == 1

def solve():
    # Fixed values
    square = [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]
    square[0][0] = 5
    square[1][1] = 9
    square[2][0] = 17
    
    # Possible values for each cell (odd numbers between 5 and 21)
    possible_values = [n for n in range(5, 22, 2)]
    
    # Try all possible combinations for the remaining cells
    for a in possible_values:  # square[0][1]
        for b in possible_values:  # square[0][2]
            # Check row 0 sum
            if 5 + a + b != 33:
                continue
            
            for c in possible_values:  # square[1][0]
                for d in possible_values:  # square[1][2]
                    # Check row 1 sum
                    if c + 9 + d != 33:
                        continue
                    
                    for e in possible_values:  # square[2][1]
                        for f in possible_values:  # square[2][2]
                            # Check row 2 sum
                            if 17 + e + f != 33:
                                continue
                            
                            # Check columns
                            if (5 + c + 17 != 33) or (a + 9 + e != 33) or (b + d + f != 33):
                                continue
                            
                            # Check diagonals
                            if (5 + 9 + f != 33) or (b + 9 + 17 != 33):
                                continue
                            
                            # All constraints satisfied
                            print(f"Found solution with square[0][2] = {b}")
                            return
    
    print("No solution found")

solve()
