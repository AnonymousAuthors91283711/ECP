[write_program]
This problem involves calculating a simple rational expression (1/2 * 1/2 + 1/3 * 1/2) and finding its exact value. The Python program will compute this expression exactly using fractions and output the result.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_expression():
    # Compute (1/2 * 1/2 + 1/3 * 1/2) using exact fractions
    term1 = Fraction(1, 2) * Fraction(1, 2)
    term2 = Fraction(1, 3) * Fraction(1, 2)
    result = term1 + term2
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_expression()
```
