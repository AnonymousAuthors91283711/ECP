For k=1983, the existence depends on whether the bound exceeds 1983. Expected Answer Type: Prop
Based on the error message and the problem statement, the issue is with the quantifier syntax in Lean. The correct way to express "for all a,b,c in S" is to use nested ∀ quantifiers rather than trying to put all three variables in one ∈ clause. The problem is asking whether there exists a set S of size 1983 within [1,10^5] containing no three-term arithmetic progression.

Looking at the enumerated answers, we see that for k=1983, the theoretical maximum progression-free set size is ~1285, which is less than 1983. This suggests that no such set exists (since we can't fit 1983 numbers without forming a three-term arithmetic progression).

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<¬∃ (S : Finset ℕ), S.card = 1983 ∧ (∀ n ∈ S, 0 < n ∧ n ≤ 10^5) ∧ (∀ a ∈ S, ∀ b ∈ S, ∀ c ∈ S, a < b → b < c → c - b ≠ b - a)>>>

Explanation:
1. The error was fixed by properly nesting the ∀ quantifiers for a,b,c ∈ S
2. The answer is negated (¬∃) because the enumerated data shows the maximum progression-free set is smaller than 1983
3. The conditions are preserved:
   - Set size exactly 1983
   - All elements between 1 and 10^5
   - No three-term arithmetic progression
4. The answer type remains Prop as required
