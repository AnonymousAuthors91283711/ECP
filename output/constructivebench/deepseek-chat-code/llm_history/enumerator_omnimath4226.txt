This problem involves finding the value of the expression w*(w+x)*(w+y)*(w+z) under the given conditions x+y+z+w=0 and x^7+y^7+z^7+w^7=0. We'll explore small integer solutions to gain insight.

The approach is:
1. Find all small integer quadruples (x,y,z,w) that satisfy both conditions
2. For each valid quadruple, compute w*(w+x)*(w+y)*(w+z)
3. Observe if there's a consistent pattern in the results

```python
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement

def find_solutions():
    # Search range for small integers
    search_range = range(-5, 6)
    seen = set()
    
    # Check all combinations with replacement to consider permutations
    for x, y, z, w in combinations_with_replacement(search_range, 4):
        # Check x+y+z+w=0
        if x + y + z + w != 0:
            continue
        
        # Check x^7 + y^7 + z^7 + w^7 = 0
        if x**7 + y**7 + z**7 + w**7 != 0:
            continue
        
        # Generate all permutations of this combination
        from itertools import permutations
        for perm in set(permutations((x, y, z, w))):
            xp, yp, zp, wp = perm
            # Avoid duplicates from different variable orderings
            key = tuple(sorted((xp, yp, zp, wp)))
            if key in seen:
                continue
            seen.add(key)
            
            # Compute the target expression
            expr = wp * (wp + xp) * (wp + yp) * (wp + zp)
            print(f"Solution: x={xp}, y={yp}, z={zp}, w={wp}")
            print(f"Expression value: {expr}")
