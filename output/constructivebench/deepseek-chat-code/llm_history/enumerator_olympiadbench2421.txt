This problem involves finding integer values of a₅ in an arithmetic sequence where the sum of squares of the first three terms equals the sum of squares of the next two terms. Given a₁=5, we'll enumerate possible values of d (the common difference) that satisfy the equation.

The approach:
1. Fix a₁ = 5
2. Express all terms in terms of d: a₂ = 5+d, a₃ = 5+2d, a₄ = 5+3d, a₅ = 5+4d
3. The equation becomes: 5² + (5+d)² + (5+2d)² = (5+3d)² + (5+4d)²
4. Simplify and solve for d
5. Calculate a₅ for valid d values

```python
def main():
    a1 = 5
    # We'll search for d in a reasonable range
    for d in range(-100, 101):
        # Calculate left side: a1² + a2² + a3²
        left = a1**2 + (a1 + d)**2 + (a1 + 2*d)**2
        # Calculate right side: a4² + a5²
        right = (a1 + 3*d)**2 + (a1 + 4*d)**2
        
        if left == right:
            a5 = a1 + 4*d
            print(f"Found solution: d={d}, a5={a5}")
    
    # After enumeration, we can see the pattern and conclude:
    print("All possible a5 values found above")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
