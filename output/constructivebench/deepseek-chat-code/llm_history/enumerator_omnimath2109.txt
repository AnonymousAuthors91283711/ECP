This problem involves calculating the area of a specific region in the unit square [0,1]×[0,1]. The region is defined by conditions on a and b where:
1. a + b > 1
2. One of three conditions must hold:
   - a² + b² < 1 (inside quarter-circle)
   - a² + 1 < b²
   - b² + 1 < a²

We'll approximate the area by discretizing the unit square and counting points that satisfy the conditions.

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_area():
    n = 10000  # grid resolution
    count = 0
    total = n * n
    
    for i in range(n):
        a = i / n
        for j in range(n):
            b = j / n
            if a + b > 1:
                if (a**2 + b**2 < 1) or (a**2 + 1 < b**2) or (b**2 + 1 < a**2):
                    count += 1
    
    area = count / total
    print(f"Approximate area: {area}")

calculate_area()
```
