Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 2 * n ! + 2
Proposed Answer: fun n => if n = 0 then 1 else if n = 1 then 2 else if n = 2 then 6 else 2^(n + 1) + 4 * n - 2
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem is about counting orderly colorings of an n×n matrix under row and column permutations.

2. The ground truth answer is `2 * n! + 2`, which suggests the count grows factorially with n.

3. The proposed answer has different cases:
   - n=0: 1
   - n=1: 2
   - n=2: 6
   - n≥3: 2^(n+1) + 4n - 2

Comparison:
- For n=0: Ground truth would give 4 (but n=0 case might not be relevant)
- For n=1: Ground truth gives 4, proposed gives 2
- For n=2: Ground truth gives 6, proposed gives 6
- For n=3: Ground truth gives 8, proposed gives 16
- For n=4: Ground truth gives 26, proposed gives 38

The answers only match at n=2 and diverge elsewhere. The growth patterns are completely different (factorial vs exponential+linear).
