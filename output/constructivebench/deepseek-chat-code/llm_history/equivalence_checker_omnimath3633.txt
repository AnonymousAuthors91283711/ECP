Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2 * n + 1) * (n + 1)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 2 * n * n + 2 * n + 1
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: (2 * n + 1) * (n + 1) = 2n² + 2n + n + 1 = 2n² + 3n + 1
2. Proposed: 2 * n * n + 2 * n + 1 = 2n² + 2n + 1

Comparing the expanded forms:
- Ground Truth: 2n² + 3n + 1
- Proposed: 2n² + 2n + 1

The difference is in the linear term (3n vs 2n) and they both have the same constant term (1). 

The proposed answer is missing an "n" term compared to the ground truth. Therefore, they are not equivalent for any n > 0.
