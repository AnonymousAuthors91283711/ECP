This problem involves simplifying a rational expression (20 + 16*20)/(20*16). We'll write a Python program to compute and simplify this expression exactly.

The approach is:
1. Compute numerator (20 + 16*20)
2. Compute denominator (20*16)
3. Simplify the fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by their GCD
4. Output the simplified form

```python
from math import gcd

def simplify_fraction(numerator, denominator):
    common_divisor = gcd(numerator, denominator)
    simplified_num = numerator // common_divisor
    simplified_den = denominator // common_divisor
    return simplified_num, simplified_den

numerator = 20 + 16 * 20
denominator = 20 * 16

simplified_num, simplified_den = simplify_fraction(numerator, denominator)

print(f"Simplified form: {simplified_num}/{simplified_den}")
```
