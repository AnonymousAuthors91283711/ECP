Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated solutions, we observe two main patterns:
1. Solutions where t0=1, t1=k, t2=k, t3=1, t4=k, t5=1, t6=1 (for k ∈ ℕ+)
2. Solutions where t0=2, t1=k, t2=k+1, t3=1, t4=k+1, t5=1, t6=2 (for k ∈ ℕ+)

The count appears to be 20 for pattern 1 (k=1..20) and 36 for pattern 2 (k=1..18 × 2 variations), but since the enumeration cuts off at k=13 for pattern 2, we can generalize that the total count is the number of positive integers k where all components are positive.
