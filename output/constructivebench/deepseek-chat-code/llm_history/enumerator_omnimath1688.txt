This problem involves analyzing the iterated function f(x) = xÂ² + 2x + 1 applied 2009 times. We need to understand the polynomial structure of g(x) = f^2009(x) and find the coefficient of x^(2^2009 - 1).

The key observation is that each iteration squares the degree and affects the coefficients. For small iterations, we can compute the coefficients explicitly to find a pattern.

Here's a Python program that computes the coefficients for small iteration counts to help identify the pattern:

```python
def f(x):
    return x**2 + 2*x + 1

def compute_coefficients(iterations):
    # Start with f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 (coefficients [1, 2, 1])
    coeffs = [1, 2, 1]
    
    for _ in range(iterations - 1):
        # Square the polynomial (x^2 + 2x + 1)^2 = x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1
        new_coeffs = [0] * (2 * len(coeffs) - 1)
        for i in range(len(coeffs)):
            for j in range(len(coeffs)):
                new_coeffs[i + j] += coeffs[i] * coeffs[j]
        coeffs = new_coeffs
    
    return coeffs

# Compute for small iteration counts to observe the pattern
for n in range(1, 6):
    coeffs = compute_coefficients(n)
    degree = 2**n
    # The coefficient we're interested in is at position (2^n - 1)
    target_pos = degree - 1
    if target_pos < len(coeffs):
        print(f"Iterations: {n}, Coefficient of x^{target_pos}: {coeffs[target_pos]}")
    else:
        print(f"Iterations: {n}, Polynomial degree too small to have x^{target_pos} term")
```

The program computes the polynomial coefficients for f^n(x) for n from 1 to 5. For each iteration, it:
1. Starts with the base polynomial coefficients [1, 2, 1]
2. Repeatedly squares the polynomial (using convolution for coefficient multiplication)
3. Prints the coefficient of x^(2^n - 1) for each iteration

The output shows the pattern for the coefficient we're interested in (a(2^2009 - 1)). Observing the pattern from small cases helps conjecture the general formula.
