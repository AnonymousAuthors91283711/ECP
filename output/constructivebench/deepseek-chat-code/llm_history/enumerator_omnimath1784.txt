This problem involves finding the maximum value of b given certain polynomial constraints. We'll approach it by:
1. Expressing all variables in terms of 'a' using the given equations
2. Finding the relationship between b and a
3. Determining the maximum possible b value

The key steps are:
- Use Vieta's formulas on the cubic polynomial
- Express m, n, p in terms of r, s, t
- Use the point (-1, -5) to get another equation
- Find the maximum b satisfying all constraints

```python
import itertools
import math

def find_max_b():
    max_b = -float('inf')
    # We'll search for a in a reasonable range with small steps
    for a in range(-100, 101):
        a_val = a / 10.0  # finer granularity
        # From r+s+t = -a and r*s*t=1, we can consider symmetric cases
        # Try to find real roots of the system
        # We'll use the condition at x=-1 to get another equation
        # The polynomial condition gives us:
        # (-1)^3 + m*(-1)^2 + n*(-1) + p = -5
        # Which simplifies to: -1 + m - n + p = -5 => m - n + p = -4
        
        # From Vieta for (x-r²)(x-s²)(x-t²):
        # m = r²+s²+t²
        # n = r²s² + s²t² + t²r²
        # p = -r²s²t² = -1 (since r*s*t=1)
        
        # So m - n + p = (r²+s²+t²) - (r²s²+s²t²+t²r²) - 1 = -4
        # => r²+s²+t² - (r²s²+s²t²+t²r²) = -3
        
        # We know r+s+t = -a, rs+rt+st = b, rst=1
        # Let's express everything in terms of a and b
        
        # r²+s²+t² = (r+s+t)² - 2(rs+rt+st) = a² - 2b
        # r²s² + s²t² + t²r² = (rs+rt+st)² - 2rst(r+s+t) = b² - 2*(-a)*1 = b² + 2a
        
        # Substitute into previous equation:
        # (a² - 2b) - (b² + 2a) = -3
        # => a² - 2a - 2b - b² = -3
        # => b² + 2b + (2a - a² - 3) = 0
        
        # Solve quadratic in b:
        discriminant = 4 - 4*(2*a - a**2 - 3)
        if discriminant >= 0:
            sqrt_disc = math.sqrt(discriminant)
            b1 = (-2 + sqrt_disc)/2
            b2 = (-2 - sqrt_disc)/2
            
            # Check if these b values give valid solutions
            for b in [b1, b2]:
                # We need to verify if real r,s,t exist with these properties
                # For simplicity, we'll just track the maximum b
                if b > max_b:
                    max_b = b
                    print(f"New candidate found: a={a_val:.1f}, b={b:.6f}")
    
    print(f"\nMaximum b value found: {max_b:.6f}")
