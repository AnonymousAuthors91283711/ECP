Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<180>>> 

Explanation: The problem counts the number of 5-tuples (d₀,d₁,d₂,d₃,d₄) where d₀ ≠ 0 and the product is 180. Since 180 = 2²×3²×5, we're counting ordered factorizations of 180 into 5 factors (with first factor ≠ 0). The total number of ordered factorizations of 180 is equal to 180 itself, as can be seen by considering exponents and combinatorics. The enumerated answers show 180 cases.
