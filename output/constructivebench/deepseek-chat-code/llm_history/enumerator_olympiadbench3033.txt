This problem involves finding the time `t` when two objects moving at speeds `S` and `M` cover a combined distance of `distance`. The exact value of `S*t` is to be determined. We'll write a Python program to compute this for given parameters S=15, M=10, and distance=100.

The solution involves:
1. Solving for t from the equation S*t + M*t = distance
2. Calculating S*t using the found t value

```python
def calculate(S, M, distance):
    # Solve for t: (S + M)*t = distance
    t = distance / (S + M)
    # Calculate S*t
    St = S * t
    return St

# Given parameters
S = 15
M = 10
distance = 100

# Calculate and print the result
result = calculate(S, M, distance)
print(result)
```
