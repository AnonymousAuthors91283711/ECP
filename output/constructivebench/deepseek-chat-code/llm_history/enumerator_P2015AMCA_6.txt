This problem involves finding the smallest natural number `n` that satisfies a system of equations relating two variables `P` and `C`. The equations describe relationships between parents (`P`) and children (`C`) in a family with certain conditions. We'll solve the system symbolically first, then enumerate possible `n` values to find the minimal solution.

```python
def solve():
    # First solve the system of equations for P and C
    # From P-2 = 3(C-2) and P-4 = 4(C-4)
    # Let's express P from both equations and set them equal
    # P = 3C - 4 from first equation
    # P = 4C - 12 from second equation
    # So 3C - 4 = 4C - 12 => C = 8
    # Then P = 3*8 - 4 = 20
    
    P = 20
    C = 8
    
    # Now solve P + n = 2(C + n)
    # 20 + n = 2(8 + n)
    # 20 + n = 16 + 2n
    # n = 4
    
    # Since we found an exact solution, we don't need enumeration
    # But we'll verify it programmatically
    n = 4
    if (P + n) == 2 * (C + n):
        print(n)
    else:
        # If verification fails, we'd need to search
        # But in this case it's not necessary
        for n in range(1, 100):
            if (P + n) == 2 * (C + n):
                print(n)
                break

solve()
