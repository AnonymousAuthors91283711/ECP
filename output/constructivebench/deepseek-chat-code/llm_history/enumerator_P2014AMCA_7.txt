The problem involves finding a real number r that satisfies three equations involving roots of 3. We need to find r and the final answer P2014AMCA_7_answer that satisfies all three equations. The solution can be found by solving the equations sequentially.

```python
import math

def main():
    # First equation: √3 * r = 3^(1/3)
    # Solving for r: r = 3^(1/3) / √3
    sqrt3 = math.sqrt(3)
    cbrt3 = 3 ** (1/3)
    r = cbrt3 / sqrt3
    
    # Verify second equation: (3^(1/3)) * r = 3^(1/6)
    # Left side: cbrt3 * r = cbrt3 * (cbrt3/sqrt3) = cbrt3^2 / sqrt3
    # Right side: 3^(1/6) = sqrt(cbrt3)
    # We can verify numerically that they're equal
    left_side = cbrt3 * r
    right_side = 3 ** (1/6)
    print(f"Verification of second equation: {left_side} ≈ {right_side} (difference: {abs(left_side - right_side)})")
    
    # Third equation: (3^(1/6)) * r = answer
    answer = (3 ** (1/6)) * r
    
    # Simplify answer algebraically:
    # answer = 3^(1/6) * (3^(1/3)/3^(1/2)) = 3^(1/6 + 1/3 - 1/2) = 3^0 = 1
    print(f"Final answer: {answer} (which simplifies to 1)")
