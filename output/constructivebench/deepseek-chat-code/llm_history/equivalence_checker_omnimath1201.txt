Ground Truth Answer: 25 / 9
Proposed Answer: (25 - 25 * Real.sqrt (1 / 3)) / 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
1. We're dealing with positive real numbers a, b, c that sum to 10 (a+b+c=10)
2. The sum of their pairwise products is 25 (ab+bc+ca=25)
3. We need to find the maximum of the minimum pairwise product (max(min(ab, bc, ca)))

Ground Truth Answer: 25/9 ≈ 2.777...

Proposed Answer: (25 - 25 * Real.sqrt (1 / 3)) / 2 ≈ (25 - 25*0.577)/2 ≈ (25-14.43)/2 ≈ 5.285

Comparison:
- The ground truth answer is about 2.777
- The proposed answer is about 5.285
- These are clearly different values
- The ground truth answer is correct (can be verified by assuming a=b=c symmetry case)
- The proposed answer doesn't match and is actually larger than the correct maximum

<<<False>>>
