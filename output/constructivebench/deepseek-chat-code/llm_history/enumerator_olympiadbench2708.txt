[write_program]
This problem involves finding the minimal positive integers x and y satisfying certain divisibility and cube conditions. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of x and y systematically.

Key observations:
1. 1584x must be a perfect cube, so x must make 1584x a cube
2. We need the minimal such x
3. Then y is the minimal positive integer where 1584x divides x*y (which simplifies to 1584 divides y)

```python
import math

def is_perfect_cube(n):
    root = round(n ** (1/3))
    return root ** 3 == n

def factorize(n):
    factors = {}
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors[2] = factors.get(2, 0) + 1
        n = n // 2
    i = 3
    while i * i <= n:
        while n % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            n = n // i
        i += 2
    if n > 1:
        factors[n] = 1
    return factors

def minimal_x():
    n = 1584
    factors = factorize(n)
    # To make 1584x a cube, we need exponents of all primes â‰¡ 0 mod 3
    x_factors = {}
    for p, exp in factors.items():
        needed = (3 - (exp % 3)) % 3
        if needed > 0:
            x_factors[p] = needed
    x = 1
    for p, exp in x_factors.items():
        x *= p ** exp
    return x

def minimal_y(x):
    # Since 1584x divides x*y, we need 1584 divides y
    return 1584

x = minimal_x()
y = minimal_y(x)
print(f"Minimal x: {x}")
print(f"Corresponding y: {y}")
```
