Looking at the enumerated answers, we can observe that the difference x - y follows a pattern based on x's parity and magnitude. For odd x values, x - y seems to be equal to 8 when x=±1, 4 when x=±3, 2 when x=±5, etc. The pattern suggests x - y = (x^2 - 1)/4.

Looking at the enumerated answers and the problem statement, we need to find a closed-form integer expression that relates x and y through x - y = k, where k is the answer we're seeking. The pattern shows that k = x^2 - 4y - 4 (derived from combining the two equations).

From the first equation 2x^2 + 8y = 26, we can solve for y:
8y = 26 - 2x^2 => y = (26 - 2x^2)/8 = (13 - x^2)/4

Then x - y = x - (13 - x^2)/4 = (4x - 13 + x^2)/4 = (x^2 + 4x - 13)/4

But looking at the enumerated answers, we see the actual k values match (x^2 - 13)/4 when x is odd. This suggests the correct closed form is (x^2 - 13)/4.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<fun x : ℤ => (x^2 - 13) / 4>>>

This matches all the enumerated cases:
For x=-9: ((-9)^2 -13)/4 = (81-13)/4 = 68/4 = 17
But x-y=8 in the enumerated answer, so this doesn't match. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Looking again, the correct pattern seems to be k = (x^2 - 1)/4 - y, but from the enumerated answers, we see:
For x=3, y=1: (9-1)/4 -1 = 2-1=1 but k=2
This doesn't match. Alternative approach: From x-y=k and y=(13-x^2)/4, then k = x - (13-x^2)/4 = (x^2 +4x -13)/4

The enumerated answers show:
x=3: (9+12-13)/4=8/4=2 (matches k=2)
x=5: (25+20-13)/4=32/4=8 (matches k=8)
x=7: (49+28-13)/4=64/4=16 (matches k=16)

Thus the correct answer is:

Looking at the enumerated answers, we can see that the difference x - y follows a pattern:
For x=3, y=1 → 3-1=2
For x=5, y=-3 → 5-(-3)=8
For x=7, y=-9 → 7-(-9)=16
For x=9, y=-17 → 9-(-17)=26

This suggests the pattern is quadratic in x. From the given answers, we can see that x - y = (x² - 1)/4 for odd x values. However, the problem expects a single integer answer, not a function.

The correct answer should be the constant difference between x and y that satisfies both equations. From the enumerated answers, we can see that when x=3, y=1, the difference is 2, which satisfies both equations:
2*3² + 8*1 = 18 + 8 = 26
3 - 1 = 2

Therefore, the answer should be the constant 2.
