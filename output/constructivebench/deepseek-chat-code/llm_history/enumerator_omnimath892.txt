[write_program]
This problem involves finding the sum of floor functions of the form floor(2^100 / (2^50 + 2^k)) for k from 0 to 100. We'll write a Python program to compute this sum exactly by evaluating each term in the sum.

The key observations are:
1. For k < 50, 2^k is negligible compared to 2^50, so the denominator is approximately 2^50
2. For k = 50, the denominator is exactly 2*2^50 = 2^51
3. For k > 50, 2^k dominates the denominator

We'll compute each term exactly using Python's arbitrary precision integers to avoid floating-point inaccuracies.

```python
def compute_sum():
    total = 0
    pow100 = 2 ** 100
    pow50 = 2 ** 50
    
    for k in range(0, 101):
        denominator = pow50 + (1 << k)
        term = pow100 // denominator
        total += term
        print(f"k={k}: term={term}, running total={total}")
    
    print(f"Final sum: {total}")

compute_sum()
```
