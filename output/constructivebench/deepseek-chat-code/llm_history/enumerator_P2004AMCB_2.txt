[write_program]
This problem asks for the maximum value of the expression `c * a^b - d` where {a,b,c,d} is a permutation of {0,1,2,3}. We need to enumerate all permutations of these numbers and compute the expression to find the maximum value.

The Python program will:
1. Generate all permutations of [0,1,2,3]
2. For each permutation, compute c * (a^b) - d
3. Track and output the maximum value found

```python
from itertools import permutations

def solve():
    max_val = -float('inf')
    numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3]
    
    for perm in permutations(numbers):
        a, b, c, d = perm
        try:
            # Handle 0^0 case which is undefined
            if a == 0 and b == 0:
                continue
            val = c * (a ** b) - d
            if val > max_val:
                max_val = val
                print(f"New max found: {val} with permutation {perm}")
        except:
            continue
    
    print(f"Final maximum value: {max_val}")

solve()
```
