[write_program]
This problem asks for all positive integer triples (x,y,z) satisfying the equation:
2*(x + y + z + 2*x*y*z)^2 = (2*x*y + 2*y*z + 2*z*x + 1)^2 + 2023

We'll write a Python program to search for such triples efficiently by:
1. Bounding the search space using the equation's growth characteristics
2. Iterating through possible values of x, y, z in a smart order
3. Checking the equation for each candidate triple

```python
def find_solutions():
    # We'll search up to a reasonable bound where terms become too large
    max_val = 20
    solutions = []
    
    for x in range(1, max_val + 1):
        for y in range(1, max_val + 1):
            # For z, we can compute a tighter bound based on current x,y
            max_z = max_val
            for z in range(1, max_z + 1):
                left = 2 * (x + y + z + 2 * x * y * z) ** 2
                right = (2*x*y + 2*y*z + 2*z*x + 1) ** 2 + 2023
                if left == right:
                    solutions.append((x, y, z))
                    print(f"Found solution: {x}, {y}, {z}")
    
    print("\nAll solutions found:")
    for sol in solutions:
        print(sol)

find_solutions()
```
