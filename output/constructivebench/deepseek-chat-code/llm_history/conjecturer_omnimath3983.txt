For m = 1, valid a1 values:
None found in range

For m = 2, valid a1 values:

Found 6 valid values

For m = 3, valid a1 values:
None found in range. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → Set ℤ
Based on the enumerated answers and problem statement, the valid initial values appear to be powers of 2 where the exponent is at least m. For m=2, we see 2^1 through 2^6. The pattern suggests the answer is all powers of 2 with exponents ≥1 when m=2, but no solutions for m=1 or m=3 indicate a more complex condition.
