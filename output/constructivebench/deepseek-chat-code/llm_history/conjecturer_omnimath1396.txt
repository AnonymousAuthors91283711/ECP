Testing n = 1
New max f for n=1: 0.5 with vector (0,)
Final result for n=1: 0.5 (1/2)

Testing n = 2
New max f for n=2: 0.5 with vector (0, 0)
Final result for n=2: 0.5 (1/2)

Testing n = 3
New max f for n=3: 0.5 with vector (0, 0, 0)
Final result for n=3: 0.5 (1/2)

Testing n = 4
New max f for n=4: 0.5 with vector (0, 0, 0, 0)
Final result for n=4: 0.5 (1/2)

Testing n = 5
New max f for n=5: 0.5 with vector (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
Final result for n=5: 0.5 (1/2). Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℝ
