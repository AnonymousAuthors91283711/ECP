abbrev omnimath3456_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3456 :
  Real.sqrt (3 ^ 3 + 3 ^ 3 + 3 ^ 3) = omnimath3456_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: 3 * Real.sqrt 3. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 7, which is at "omnimath3456_answer " in "abbrev omnimath3456_answer : ℝ := 3 * Real.sqrt 3", there is an error: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.sqrt', and it does not have executable code.

Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to make the answer noncomputable since it involves Real.sqrt. The enumerated answer shows 9, which matches the calculation: √(3³ + 3³ + 3³) = √(27 + 27 + 27) = √81 = 9. The proposed answer 3 * √3 is incorrect as it equals √27, not √81.

Here's the corrected answer:
<<<noncomputable abbrev omnimath3456_answer : ℝ := 9>>>

Explanation:
1. The error indicates we need 'noncomputable' for Real.sqrt operations
2. The actual calculation simplifies to √81 = 9
3. The proposed 3*√3 was incorrect (equals √27)
4. The enumerated answer confirms the correct value is 9
5. The answer type remains ℝ as required[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

From the problem statement and the enumerated answer, we can see that the expression being evaluated is the square root of (3³ + 3³ + 3³). Let's analyze this:

1. First, calculate 3³ = 27
2. Then sum three of them: 27 + 27 + 27 = 81
3. Finally, take the square root: √81 = 9

The error in the proposed answer comes from incorrectly using the `noncomputable` keyword inside the definition. In Lean, `noncomputable` should be placed before the `abbrev` declaration, not inside the definition. Also, since the answer is a simple constant (9), we don't actually need the `noncomputable` marker here.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<9>>> 

Explanation:
The expression evaluates to 9 because:
√(3³ + 3³ + 3³) = √(27 + 27 + 27) = √81 = 9
This is a straightforward calculation that doesn't require any noncomputable operations, so we can simply return the constant value 9.
