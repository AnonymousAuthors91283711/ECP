[write_program]
This problem involves finding real numbers (a, b) that satisfy two conditions:
1. √a + √b = 8
2. log₁₀a + log₁₀b = 2 (which is equivalent to log₁₀(ab) = 2 or ab = 100)

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible solutions by:
1. Iterating through possible values of √a (let's call it x)
2. Calculating √b as 8-x
3. Checking if the product (x² * (8-x)²) equals 100
4. Printing valid (a,b) pairs where a=x² and b=(8-x)²

```python
import math

def find_solutions():
    # We'll check x values from 0 to 8 in small increments
    step = 0.0001
    solutions = []
    for x in [i * step for i in range(int(8/step) + 1)]:
        y = 8 - x
        a = x * x
        b = y * y
        if abs(a * b - 100) < 1e-6:  # account for floating point precision
            solutions.append((a, b))
            print(f"Found solution: a={a:.4f}, b={b:.4f}")
    
    # Deduplicate solutions (since we might find same pair multiple times due to floating point)
    unique_solutions = []
    seen = set()
    for a, b in solutions:
        key = (round(a, 4), round(b, 4))
        if key not in seen:
            seen.add(key)
            unique_solutions.append((a, b))
    
    print("\nAll unique solutions:")
    for a, b in unique_solutions:
        print(f"a={a:.4f}, b={b:.4f}")

find_solutions()
```
