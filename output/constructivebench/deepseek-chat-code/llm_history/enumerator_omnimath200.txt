[write_program]
This problem asks for all pairs of non-zero integers (m, n) that satisfy the equation (m² + n)(m + n²) = (m - n)³. We'll write a Python program to enumerate small integer solutions and look for patterns.

The approach:
1. Iterate over possible integer values of m and n within a reasonable range
2. Check if the equation holds for each pair
3. Print valid pairs as they're found
4. Avoid checking when m or n is zero (per problem constraints)

```python
def solve_omnimath200():
    # We'll check values from -20 to 20, which should be sufficient to spot patterns
    min_val = -20
    max_val = 20
    print(f"Searching for solutions in range [{min_val}, {max_val}]")
    
    solutions = []
    for m in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
        if m == 0:
            continue
        for n in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
            if n == 0:
                continue
            left = (m**2 + n) * (m + n**2)
            right = (m - n)**3
            if left == right:
                solutions.append((m, n))
                print(f"Found solution: (m, n) = ({m}, {n})")
    
    print("\nAll solutions found:")
    for sol in solutions:
        print(sol)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_omnimath200()
```
