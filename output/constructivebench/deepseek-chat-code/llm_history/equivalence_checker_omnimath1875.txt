theorem omnimath1875 :
  let validPairs := Finset.filter (fun (c, p) => 
    if p = 0 then c < 360 else c * 10^(digits 10 p).length + p < 360) 
    (Finset.product (Finset.range 60) (Finset.range 60))

Ground Truth Answer: 153 / 1180
Proposed Answer: 73/450
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting valid pairs (c,p) where:
   - If p=0, then c<360
   - Else, c*10^(digits of p) + p < 360
   - c and p are both in range 0-59 (since Finset.range 60 gives 0-59)

2. The ground truth answer is 153/1180 ≈ 0.12966
3. The proposed answer is 73/450 ≈ 0.16222

The proposed answer is significantly different from the ground truth answer (about 25% higher). The calculations don't match, so these are not equivalent answers.
