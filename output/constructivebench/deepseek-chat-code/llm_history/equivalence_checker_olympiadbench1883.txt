Ground Truth Answer: fun n => ⌈(n : ℝ) / 2⌉.toNat + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (n + 1) / 2 + 1
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. The ground truth answer is: ⌈n/2⌉ + 1 (after converting to Nat)
2. The proposed answer is: (n + 1)/2 + 1 (integer division)

For odd n:
- Ground truth: (n+1)/2 + 1
- Proposed: (n+1)/2 + 1
They match

For even n:
- Ground truth: n/2 + 1
- Proposed: (n+1)/2 + 1 (which equals n/2 + 1 when n is even since (n+1)/2 = n/2 for even n)

The expressions are actually equivalent for all natural numbers n, because:
- For even n: n/2 = (n+1)/2 (integer division)
- For odd n: ⌈n/2⌉ = (n+1)/2
