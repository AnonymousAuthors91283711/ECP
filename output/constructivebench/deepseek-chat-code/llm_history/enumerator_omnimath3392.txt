[write_program]
This problem involves computing the product (1 - 1/3)*(1 - 1/4)*(1 - 1/5). We'll write a Python program to calculate this exact rational value by maintaining numerator and denominator separately to avoid floating-point approximations.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_product():
    # Initialize product as 1 (Fraction(1,1))
    product = Fraction(1, 1)
    
    # List of denominators in the product terms
    denominators = [3, 4, 5]
    
    for d in denominators:
        # Multiply by (1 - 1/d) = (d-1)/d
        term = Fraction(d-1, d)
        product *= term
    
    # Print the exact fractional result
    print(product)

compute_product()
```
