. Enumerated Answers: n=3: max positive coordinates = 1
n=4: max positive coordinates = 1
n=5: max positive coordinates = 2
n=6: max positive coordinates = 2
n=7: max positive coordinates = 3
n=8: max positive coordinates = 3
n=9: max positive coordinates = 4

For n=2023, the maximum number of positive coordinates is: 1011. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated answers, we can observe a clear pattern:
- For odd n, the maximum positive coordinates is (n-1)/2
- For even n, it's (n-2)/2

The pattern suggests the maximum is floor division of (n-1) by 2. The error in the original proposal was trying to use a function when a constant was expected (for n=2023). Here's the corrected answer:

<<<1011>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem asks for the maximum number of positive coordinates in a vector of length 2023 satisfying the given condition
2. From the pattern in smaller cases, we see the maximum is ⌊(n-1)/2⌋
3. For n=2023: (2023-1)/2 = 1011
4. The answer must be a concrete ℕ (1011) rather than a function since the problem is specifically about n=2023
