[write_program]
The problem asks to compute the value of (exp(i*2π/3))^6 + (exp(i*4π/3))^6. We can approach this by:

1. Recognizing that exp(iθ) is Euler's formula representing cosθ + i sinθ
2. Using De Moivre's theorem: (exp(iθ))^n = exp(i nθ) = cos(nθ) + i sin(nθ)
3. Calculating each term separately and summing them

The Python program will compute this expression exactly using symbolic computation (sympy) and numerically to verify. We'll output both representations.

```python
import sympy as sp
import cmath

# Define symbolic variables
i = sp.I
pi = sp.pi

# Compute the expression symbolically
term1 = sp.exp(i * 2*pi/3)**6
term2 = sp.exp(i * 4*pi/3)**6
symbolic_result = term1 + term2
simplified = sp.simplify(symbolic_result)

# Compute numerically for verification
num_term1 = cmath.exp(1j * 2*cmath.pi/3)**6
num_term2 = cmath.exp(1j * 4*cmath.pi/3)**6
numerical_result = num_term1 + num_term2

print("Symbolic result:", simplified)
print("Numerical verification:", numerical_result)
```
