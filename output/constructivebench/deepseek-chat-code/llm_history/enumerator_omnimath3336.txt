This problem involves finding all real values p in [0,1] that satisfy an equation comparing two binomial probability sums. The left sum is over k=0 to 3 (but only counts terms where k>1.5), and the right sum is over k=0 to 5 (but only counts terms where k>2.5). We'll enumerate p values in [0,1] with small increments to find candidates that make both sides equal.

```python
def main():
    # We'll test p values from 0 to 1 in small increments
    increment = 0.0001
    tolerance = 1e-8
    
    def left_sum(p):
        total = 0.0
        for k in range(4):
            if k > 1.5:  # 3/2 = 1.5
                comb = 1  # choose(3,k)
                if k == 2:
                    comb = 3
                elif k == 3:
                    comb = 1
                term = comb * (p**k) * ((1-p)**(3-k))
                total += term
        return total
    
    def right_sum(p):
        total = 0.0
        for k in range(6):
            if k > 2.5:  # 5/2 = 2.5
                comb = 1  # choose(5,k)
                if k == 3:
                    comb = 10
                elif k == 4:
                    comb = 5
                elif k == 5:
                    comb = 1
                term = comb * (p**k) * ((1-p)**(5-k))
                total += term
        return total
    
    # Enumerate p values and check when left_sum â‰ˆ right_sum
    p = 0.0
    while p <= 1.0:
        left = left_sum(p)
        right = right_sum(p)
        if abs(left - right) < tolerance:
            print(f"Found candidate p = {p:.6f}")
        p += increment
    
    print("Enumeration complete")

    main()
