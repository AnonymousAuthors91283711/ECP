[write_program]
This problem involves finding a number that is not divisible by any of the primes 2, 3, 5, or 7, but where at least one of these primes divides one of the expressions involving powers of 2 and 3. We'll write a Python program to search for such numbers by checking the divisibility conditions.

The approach will be:
1. Generate candidate numbers in increasing order
2. For each candidate, check if it's not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7
3. If condition 2 is satisfied, check if any of the given expressions is divisible by one of these primes
4. Output candidates that satisfy both conditions

```python
def is_candidate(n):
    # Check if n is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]
    for p in primes:
        if n % p == 0:
            return False
    return True

def check_expressions():
    # Precompute the large exponents modulo each prime
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]
    expressions = [
        (2, 606, -1),  # 2^606 - 1
        (2, 606, 1),   # 2^606 + 1
        (2, 607, 1),   # 2^607 + 1
        (2, 607, 3, 607)  # 2^607 + 3^607
    ]
    
    # Check each expression for divisibility by each prime
    for p in primes:
        for expr in expressions:
            if len(expr) == 3:
                base, exp, offset = expr
                # Compute (base^exp + offset) mod p
                mod = pow(base, exp, p)
                mod = (mod + offset) % p
            else:
                base1, exp1, base2, exp2 = expr
                mod1 = pow(base1, exp1, p)
                mod2 = pow(base2, exp2, p)
                mod = (mod1 + mod2) % p
            if mod == 0:
                return True
    return False

def main():
    max_check = 1000  # Reasonable upper bound for demonstration
    for n in range(1, max_check + 1):
        if is_candidate(n):
            if check_expressions():
                print(f"Found candidate: {n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
