Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0, 0)}
Proposed Answer: {(0, 0, 0)} ∪ {(a, 0, a) | a : ℤ} ∪ {(a, 0, -a) | a : ℤ} ∪ {(0, a, a) | a : ℤ} ∪ {(0, a, -a) | a : ℤ}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all integer triples (a,b,c) such that a² + b² + c² = a²b².

2. Ground truth answer is just {(0,0,0)}.

3. Proposed answer includes:
   - (0,0,0)
   - All triples where b=0 and c=±a
   - All triples where a=0 and c=±b

Testing the proposed answer:
- For (a,0,a): a² + 0 + a² = 2a² vs a²*0 = 0 → Only works when a=0
- For (0,a,a): 0 + a² + a² = 2a² vs 0*a² = 0 → Only works when a=0
- Similar for other cases - they only satisfy the equation when a=0 or b=0

The only solution that works for all integers is (0,0,0). The other cases in the proposed answer only work when the variables are zero, so they don't provide any additional valid solutions.
