[write_program]
The problem asks to find the unique number x in {1,2,...,11} such that when x is removed, the average of the remaining numbers is exactly 6.1. We'll write a Python program to check each candidate and find the solution.

```python
def main():
    numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}
    total_sum = sum(numbers)
    count = len(numbers)
    
    for x in sorted(numbers):
        remaining_sum = total_sum - x
        remaining_count = count - 1
        average = remaining_sum / remaining_count
        
        # Print each candidate being checked
        print(f"Checking x={x}: average={average}")
        
        # Check if average matches exactly 6.1
        if abs(average - 6.1) < 1e-9:  # Account for floating point precision
            print(f"Found solution: x={x}")
            return
    
    print("No solution found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
