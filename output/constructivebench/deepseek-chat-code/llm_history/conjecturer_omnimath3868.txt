theorem omnimath3868 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hf : ∀ x, 0 < x → 0 < f x) :
  (∀ w x y z, 0 < w → 0 < x → 0 < y → 0 < z → w * x = y * z → 
    ((f w)^2 + (f x)^2) / (f (y^2) + f (z^2)) = (w^2 + x^2) / (y^2 + z^2)) 
  ↔ f ∈ omnimath3868_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing exponents:
Found candidate: f(x) = x^-1.0
Found candidate: f(x) = x^1.0. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
<<<{f | ∃ c : ℝ, f = fun x => x^c}>>>
