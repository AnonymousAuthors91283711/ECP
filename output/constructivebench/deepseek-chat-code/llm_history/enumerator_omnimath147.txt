[write_program]
This problem appears to be about finding for which natural numbers k there exists a natural number a such that there are infinitely many n where 2018 divides the number of divisors of a + n*k. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible k values and check the condition for small a and n values.

The approach will be:
1. For small k values (1 to 20), check if there exists an a where for several n values, the divisor count of a + n*k is divisible by 2018
2. We'll limit our search to reasonable bounds (a up to 1000, n up to 100) for practicality
3. For each k, we'll print whether we found any a that satisfies the condition for multiple n values

```python
import math

def count_divisors(m):
    if m == 0:
        return 0
    count = 0
    sqrt_m = int(math.isqrt(m))
    for i in range(1, sqrt_m + 1):
        if m % i == 0:
            count += 2
    if sqrt_m * sqrt_m == m:
        count -= 1
    return count

def check_k(k, max_a=1000, max_n=100):
    for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
        valid_n_count = 0
        for n in range(0, max_n + 1):
            num = a + n * k
            d = count_divisors(num)
            if d % 2018 == 0:
                valid_n_count += 1
                if valid_n_count >= 3:  # Found multiple n values
                    print(f"For k={k}, found a={a} with condition satisfied at n={n}")
                    return True
    return False

def main():
    print("Checking k values from 1 to 20:")
    for k in range(1, 21):
        if check_k(k):
            print(f"k={k} appears to satisfy the condition")
        else:
            print(f"k={k} does not appear to satisfy the condition")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
