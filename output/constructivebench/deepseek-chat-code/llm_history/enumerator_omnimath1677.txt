This problem involves counting the number of functions from a 6-element domain to {0, 1/2, 1} that satisfy a specific floor condition. We'll enumerate all possible functions (3^6 = 729 possibilities) and count how many satisfy the condition.

```python
from itertools import product
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    S = [0, Fraction(1,2), 1]
    total = 0
    favorable = 0
    
    for f in product(S, repeat=6):
        # Compute left side: floor(f0*f1*f2)
        product_left = f[0] * f[1] * f[2]
        floor_left = int(product_left)
        
        # Compute right side: f3*f4*f5*f3
        product_right = f[3] * f[4] * f[5] * f[3]
        
        if floor_left == product_right:
            favorable += 1
        total += 1
    
    # Output the probability as a fraction
    print(f"Favorable cases: {favorable}")
    print(f"Total cases: {total}")
    print(f"Probability: {Fraction(favorable, total)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
