[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number `y` that cannot be expressed as `3*n + 1` where `n` is between 1 and 400 inclusive. We'll write a Python program to find this number by checking all candidates up to a reasonable threshold.

The approach:
1. Generate all numbers of the form 3*n + 1 for n from 1 to 400
2. Find the smallest natural number not in this set
3. Since the sequence starts at 4 (when n=1) and increases by 3 each time, we expect gaps to appear after 3*400+1=1201

```python
def find_min_excluded():
    max_n = 400
    # Generate all possible y values in the form 3n+1 for 1 ≤ n ≤ 400
    possible_ys = {3 * n + 1 for n in range(1, max_n + 1)}
    
    # Check numbers starting from 1 upwards until we find one not in the set
    y = 1
    while True:
        if y not in possible_ys:
            print(f"Found excluded number: {y}")
            break
        y += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_excluded()
```
