The problem involves calculating the total number of carnations given certain fractions of flowers. We'll translate this mathematical problem into Python by:
1. Using exact rational numbers (via fractions.Fraction) to avoid floating-point inaccuracies
2. Following the same calculation steps as in the Lean code
3. Printing the final result as an exact fraction

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve():
    total = Fraction(100)
    pink = Fraction(6, 10) * total
    red = total - pink
    pink_roses = Fraction(1, 3) * pink
    pink_carnations = pink - pink_roses
    red_carnations = Fraction(3, 4) * red
    total_carnations = pink_carnations + red_carnations
    print(total_carnations)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```
