This problem involves finding all possible numbers of dimes (d) that can appear in a combination of nickels (n), dimes (d), and quarters (q) that sum to 100 coins totaling $8.35. We need to find the difference between the maximum and minimum possible number of dimes.

We'll solve the system of equations:
1. n + d + q = 100
2. 5n + 10d + 25q = 835

We can simplify the second equation to n + 2d + 5q = 167 by dividing by 5. Then subtract the first equation to get d + 4q = 67.

We'll enumerate possible values of q (quarters) that satisfy d = 67 - 4q ≥ 0 and n = 100 - d - q ≥ 0.

```python
def enumerate_dimes():
    min_d = float('inf')
    max_d = -float('inf')
    found = False
    
    for q in range(0, 100):
        d = 67 - 4 * q
        n = 100 - d - q
        
        if d >= 0 and n >= 0:
            found = True
            if d < min_d:
                min_d = d
            if d > max_d:
                max_d = d
            print(f"Found solution: n={n}, d={d}, q={q}")
    
    if found:
        print(f"Difference between max and min dimes: {max_d - min_d}")

enumerate_dimes()
```
