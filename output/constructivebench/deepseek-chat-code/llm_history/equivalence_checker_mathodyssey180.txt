noncomputable abbrev mathodyssey180_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem mathodyssey180 (modelWidth actualWidth : ℝ) (h : modelWidth = 1.2) : 
    actualWidth = mathodyssey180_answer modelWidth := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun modelWidth => (modelWidth * 10) / 3
Proposed Answer: fun modelWidth : ℝ => modelWidth * (1 / 1.2)
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: `(modelWidth * 10) / 3`
2. Proposed: `modelWidth * (1 / 1.2)`

Let's simplify both expressions:
- Ground Truth: `(modelWidth * 10)/3 = modelWidth * (10/3) ≈ modelWidth * 3.333...`
- Proposed: `modelWidth * (1/1.2) ≈ modelWidth * 0.833...`

These are clearly different functions (3.333... ≠ 0.833...). The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth.
