Pattern verification failed. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the problem statement and the uniqueness condition, the sequence `a` must be constructed to ensure unique representations in the form `n = a i + 2 a j + 4 a k`. The most natural choice is to use powers of 8 since they grow fast enough to guarantee uniqueness in this ternary representation. The enumerated answers suggest this pattern.
