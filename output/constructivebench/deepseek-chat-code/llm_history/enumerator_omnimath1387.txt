This problem involves finding the maximum value of cos(a₀) - cos(a₃) for a sequence defined by a recurrence relation and satisfying a quadratic interpolation condition. We'll approach it by:

1. Modeling the recurrence: a₂ = a₁ + a₀, a₃ = a₂ + a₁
2. Finding quadratic coefficients A, B, C that fit cos(aₙ) at n=1,2,3,4
3. Exploring possible values to find the maximum difference

We'll use small parameter samples and exact values where possible.

    # Using exact fractions to avoid floating point errors
    n1, n2, n3 = Fraction(n1), Fraction(n2), Fraction(n3)
    y1, y2, y3 = Fraction(y1).limit_denominator(1000), Fraction(y2).limit_denominator(1000), Fraction(y3).limit_denominator(1000)
    
    # Solving system of equations for A,B,C

    if denom == 0:
        return None  # No unique solution
        
    A = ( (y1-y2)/(n1-n2) - (y2-y3)/(n2-n3) ) / (n1-n3)
    B = (y1-y2)/(n1-n2) - A*(n1+n2)
    C = y1 - A*n1**2 - B*n1
    
    return (float(A), float(B), float(C))

[refine_program]
Let me analyze the program and its requirements:

Judgement:
1. The problem asks for the greatest value of cos(a₀) - cos(a₃) under given recurrence and polynomial conditions.
2. The program attempts to:
   - Sample a₀ and a₁ values
   - Compute a₂ and a₃ using the recurrence
   - Find quadratic polynomials fitting the cosine values
   - Track the maximum difference
3. Issues found:
   - The program doesn't output any results (empty enumeration)
   - The sampling resolution might be too coarse (π/8 steps)
   - The quadratic solving might be numerically unstable
   - No intermediate results are printed during computation

The program fails to produce any output, which violates requirement #1 (streaming partial results). The approach is conceptually correct but needs adjustments to ensure it produces results.

<<<False>>>

Here's a corrected version that:
1. Uses finer sampling
2. Prints intermediate results
3. Handles numerical stability better
4. Includes progress tracking

```python
import math
from itertools import product
import numpy as np

def solve_quadratic(points):
    """Solve for A,B,C given three points (n, cos(a_n)) using numpy for stability"""
    try:
        n = np.array([p[0] for p in points])
        y = np.array([p[1] for p in points])
        A = np.vstack([n**2, n, np.ones(3)]).T
        coeffs = np.linalg.solve(A, y)
        return coeffs
    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
        return None

def check_fourth_point(coeffs, n4, y4):
    """Check if the fourth point fits the quadratic"""
    A, B, C = coeffs
    return abs(A*n4**2 + B*n4 + C - y4) < 1e-6

max_diff = -2
best_params = None
steps = 32  # Increased resolution
total = steps**2
count = 0

print("Searching for maximum cos(a0) - cos(a3)...")
for i, j in product(range(steps), repeat=2):
    count += 1
    if count % 100 == 0:
        print(f"Progress: {count}/{total
[refine_program]
Judgement:
The problem appears to be a mathematical theorem statement from Lean (a theorem prover) about finding the greatest value in a set defined by certain recurrence relations and polynomial constraints. Since there's no actual Python program provided to evaluate, and the "program" section is empty with an error message, this submission cannot be accepted.

The problem requires:
1. A Python program that enumerates possible answers
2. Handling of real-valued trigonometric functions and recurrence relations
3. Finding extremal values in a constrained set

Since no program was provided, we need to create one from scratch that attempts to solve this mathematical problem numerically. We'll create a program that searches for values satisfying the given conditions and looks for the maximum difference in cosine values.

<<<False>>>

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def objective(x):
    a0, a1 = x
    a2 = a1 + a0
    a3 = a2 + a1
    return -(np.cos(a0) - np.cos(a3))  # Negative for maximization

def constraint(x):
    a0, a1 = x
    a = [0, a0, a1, a1 + a0, a1 + (a1 + a0)]  # a[1] to a[4] correspond to n=1..4
    # Try to find A,B,C that fit the polynomial constraint
    n_values = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    cos_values = np.cos(a[1:5])
    
    # Solve least squares for A,B,C
    M = np.vstack([n_values**2, n_values, np.ones(4)]).T
    A, B, C = np.linalg.lstsq(M, cos_values, rcond=None)[0]
    
    # Return the sum of squared errors as constraint (should be near 0)
    errors = A * n_values**2 + B * n_values + C - cos_values
    return -np.sum(errors**2) + 1e-6  # Constraint: sum(errors^2) <= 1e-6

# Initial guesses
initial_guess = [1.0, 1.0]

# Optimization with constraints
bounds = [(-10, 10), (-10, 10)]
