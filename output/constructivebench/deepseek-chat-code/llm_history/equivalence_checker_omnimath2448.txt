Ground Truth Answer: {(128, 32, 16, 4), (160, 16, 8, 4)}
Proposed Answer: {(2^(11*k + 7), 2^(11*k + 5), 2^(11*k + 4), 2^(3*k + 1)) | k : ℕ} ∪ {(2^(11*k + 10), 2^(11*k + 4), 2^(11*k + 3), 2^(3*k + 1)) | k : ℕ}
Let's analyze the proposed answer and compare it with the ground truth:

1. For k=0 in the first set:
   (2^7, 2^5, 2^4, 2^1) = (128, 32, 16, 4) - matches first ground truth tuple

2. For k=0 in the second set:
   (2^10, 2^4, 2^3, 2^1) = (1024, 16, 8, 4) - doesn't match second ground truth tuple (160,16,8,4)

3. Checking the second ground truth tuple (160,16,8,4):
   - 160 is not a power of 2 (160 = 2^4 * 10)
   - Therefore it cannot be represented in the proposed form

4. The proposed answer only includes solutions that are powers of 2, while the ground truth includes a solution with non-power-of-2 components.

The proposed answer is partially correct as it captures one of the solutions, but misses the other due to its restrictive form.
