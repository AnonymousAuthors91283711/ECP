[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest number N > 1 that is both a pentagonal number (expressible as a*(2a-1)) and has the property that all integers from 1 to 10 divide N(N-1)/2. We'll write a Python program to search for such numbers.

The approach:
1. Generate pentagonal numbers N = a*(2a-1) for increasing a
2. For each N, check if N(N-1)/2 is divisible by all numbers 1 through 10
3. Since 1 through 10 must divide N(N-1)/2, the LCM of 1-10 (2520) must divide it
4. We'll use this to optimize the search

```python
import math

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)

# Calculate LCM of numbers 1 through 10
required_lcm = 1
for i in range(1, 11):
    required_lcm = lcm(required_lcm, i)

# Search for pentagonal numbers N = a*(2a-1) where N(N-1)/2 is divisible by required_lcm
a = 1
found = False
while not found:
    N = a * (2 * a - 1)
    triangular = N * (N - 1) // 2
    if triangular % required_lcm == 0:
        print(f"Found candidate: N = {N} (a = {a})")
        # Verify all divisors 1..10
        valid = True
        for k in range(1, 11):
            if triangular % k != 0:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            print(f"Solution found: {N}")
            found = True
    a += 1
    # Safety limit to prevent infinite loop
    if a > 100000:
        print("Search limit reached")
        break
```
