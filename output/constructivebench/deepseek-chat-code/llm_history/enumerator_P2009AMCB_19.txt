[write_program]
This problem asks for the sum of all prime numbers that can be expressed as f(n) = n⁴ - 360n² + 400 where n is a positive integer. We'll write a Python program to:

1. Evaluate f(n) for small positive integers n
2. Check if the result is prime
3. Sum all such primes found

We'll limit our search to n up to 100 since larger values quickly produce very large numbers that are unlikely to be prime.

```python
import math

def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num == 2:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return False
    max_divisor = math.isqrt(num) + 1
    for d in range(3, max_divisor, 2):
        if num % d == 0:
            return False
    return True

def f(n):
    return n**4 - 360*n**2 + 400

total = 0
print("Primes found:")
for n in range(1, 101):
    val = f(n)
    if is_prime(val):
        print(f"n={n}, f(n)={val}")
        total += val

print(f"\nSum of primes: {total}")
```
