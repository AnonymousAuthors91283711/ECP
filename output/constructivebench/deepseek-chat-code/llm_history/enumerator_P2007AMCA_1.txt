This problem involves calculating the difference in costs between Pam and Susan after applying percentage discounts to their purchases. We'll compute the exact values step by step.

```python
# Calculate Susan's cost: 4 items at $20 each with 25% discount
susan_unit_price = 20 * (1 - 0.25)
susan_total = 4 * susan_unit_price

# Calculate Pam's cost: 5 items at $20 each with 30% discount
pam_unit_price = 20 * (1 - 0.30)
pam_total = 5 * pam_unit_price

# Compute the difference
difference = pam_total - susan_total

# Output the exact integer result
print(int(difference))
```
