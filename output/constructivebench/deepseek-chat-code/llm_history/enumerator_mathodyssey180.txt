This problem appears to be about finding a function `mathodyssey180_answer` that relates a model width to an actual width, with the model width fixed at 1.2. Since the exact relationship isn't specified, we'll explore simple linear relationships (scaling factors) as potential candidates.

We'll enumerate scaling factors from 0.1 to 10.0 in increments of 0.1, printing each candidate and the resulting actual width when applied to modelWidth=1.2. This will help identify potential patterns or exact values that might satisfy the relationship.

```python
def main():
    model_width = 1.2
    print(f"Exploring scaling factors for model_width = {model_width}")
    
    # Enumerate scaling factors from 0.1 to 10.0 in 0.1 increments
    for i in range(1, 101):
        scale = i * 0.1
        actual_width = model_width * scale
        print(f"Scale: {scale:.1f}, Actual width: {actual_width:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
