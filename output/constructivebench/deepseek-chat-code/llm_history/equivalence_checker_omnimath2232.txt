Ground Truth Answer: 0
Proposed Answer: 49
Let's analyze this problem carefully:

1. The problem asks for the least value of the function (x² + 6x + 2)² over all real x.

2. The ground truth answer is 0, which would occur when x² + 6x + 2 = 0.

3. The proposed answer is 49.

4. Let's check if x² + 6x + 2 can equal 0:
   - Solving x² + 6x + 2 = 0 gives x = [-6 ± √(36-8)]/2 = [-6 ± √28]/2
   - Since the discriminant (28) is positive, real solutions exist.

5. Therefore, the minimum value is indeed 0 when x is one of the roots above.

6. The proposed answer 49 would be the value when x = -3 (vertex of the parabola):
   - (-3)² + 6*(-3) + 2 = 9 - 18 + 2 = -7
   - (-7)² = 49
   - But this is not the minimum since we can get 0.

The proposed answer gives the value at the vertex, but not the actual minimum of the function.
