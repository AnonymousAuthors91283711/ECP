This problem asks for the greatest natural number r such that 3^r divides (16!/((4!)^4 * 24)) * (12)^4, but 3^(r+1) does not divide it. We'll compute the exponent of 3 in the prime factorization of this expression.

The approach is:
1. Compute the exponent of 3 in 16! using Legendre's formula
2. Subtract 4 times the exponent of 3 in 4! (from the denominator)
3. Add the exponent of 3 in 12^4 = (3*4)^4
4. The denominator has 24 which contributes no factors of 3

```python
import math

def exponent_of_p_in_factorial(n, p):
    """Compute exponent of prime p in n! using Legendre's formula"""
    e = 0
    power = p
    while power <= n:
        e += n // power
        power *= p
    return e

# Compute numerator: 16!
numerator_exp = exponent_of_p_in_factorial(16, 3)

# Compute denominator: (4!)^4 * 24
denominator_exp = 4 * exponent_of_p_in_factorial(4, 3)  # 24 contributes 0 factors of 3

# Compute additional term: (12)^4 = (3*4)^4 = 3^4 * 4^4
additional_exp = 4

total_exp = numerator_exp - denominator_exp + additional_exp

print(f"The greatest exponent r is: {total_exp}")
```
