theorem omnimath3912 (n : ℕ) (hn : n ≥ 3) :
  (∃ (a : Fin (n + 2) → ℝ), 
    a ⟨n, by omega⟩ = a ⟨0, by omega⟩ ∧ 
    a ⟨n + 1, by omega⟩ = a ⟨1, by omega⟩ ∧

  n ∈ omnimath3912_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking values of n where the sequence conditions hold:
n = 3 satisfies the conditions
n = 6 satisfies the conditions
n = 9 satisfies the conditions
n = 12 satisfies the conditions. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{n | n % 3 = 0}>>>
