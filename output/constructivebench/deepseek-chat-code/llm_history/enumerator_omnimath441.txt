[write_program]
This problem asks for the maximum possible value of the sum âˆ‘(x_j^4 - x_j^5) under the constraints that all x_j are non-negative and sum to 1. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible configurations for small n values to help conjecture the pattern.

The approach:
1. For small n (2-5), we'll generate all possible distributions of x values that sum to 1 (discretized)
2. Calculate the objective function for each distribution
3. Track the maximum value found
4. Output results for each n to observe patterns

```python
import itertools

def main():
    # Test for n from 2 to 5
    for n in range(2, 6):
        print(f"\nn = {n}")
        max_val = -1
        best_dist = None
        
        # Discretize with step 0.01 for efficiency
        steps = 100
        for counts in itertools.product(range(steps + 1), repeat=n):
            total = sum(counts)
            if total != steps:
                continue
                
            # Convert counts to x values (summing to 1)
            x = [c/steps for c in counts]
            # Calculate objective function
            s = sum(xj**4 - xj**5 for xj in x)
            
            if s > max_val:
                max_val = s
                best_dist = x
                print(f"New max: {max_val:.6f} with distribution: {[round(xj, 2) for xj in x]}")
        
        print(f"Final max for n={n}: {max_val:.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
