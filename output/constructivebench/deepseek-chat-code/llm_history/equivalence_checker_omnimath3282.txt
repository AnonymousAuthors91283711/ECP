Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 2 * n - 2
Proposed Answer: fun n => if Even n then 2 * (n - 1) else n
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: `2 * n - 2` for all n ≥ 2
2. Proposed: `if Even n then 2 * (n - 1) else n`

Let's evaluate them for different values of n:

For n=2 (even):
- Ground Truth: 2*2-2 = 2
- Proposed: 2*(2-1) = 2

For n=3 (odd):
- Ground Truth: 2*3-2 = 4
- Proposed: 3 (since it's odd)

For n=4 (even):
- Ground Truth: 2*4-2 = 6
- Proposed: 2*(4-1) = 6

For n=5 (odd):
- Ground Truth: 2*5-2 = 8
- Proposed: 5

We can see that:
- For even n, both answers give the same result (2*(n-1) = 2n-2)
- For odd n, the proposed answer gives n while the ground truth gives 2n-2

The proposed answer is only correct for even n, but incorrect for odd n. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
