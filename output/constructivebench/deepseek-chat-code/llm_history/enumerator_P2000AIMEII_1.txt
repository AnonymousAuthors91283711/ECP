The problem asks to find positive integers m and n that are coprime, satisfy the equation m/n = 2/5 + 8/25, and minimize m + n. We'll compute the sum 2/5 + 8/25 = 18/25, then look for reduced fractions equal to 18/25 and find the one with minimal denominator (which will automatically give minimal m+n since m = 18/25 * n must be integer).

```python
import math

def find_minimal_solution():
    # We know the target fraction is 18/25
    target = 18/25
    
    # We'll check denominators n from 1 upwards until we find a valid m
    for n in range(1, 1000):
        m = round(target * n)
        # Check if the fraction matches exactly and is reduced
        if math.isclose(m/n, target) and math.gcd(m, n) == 1:
            print(f"Found solution: m={m}, n={n}, m+n={m+n}")
            print(f"Minimal m+n is {m+n}")
            return

find_minimal_solution()
```
