Ground Truth Answer: {p | let (a, b) := p; |a| = |b|}
Proposed Answer: {p : ℤ × ℤ | p.1 = p.2}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding all pairs (a,b) of integers where there exist functions f,g: ℤ → ℤ such that:
   - f(g(x)) = x + a for all x
   - g(f(x)) = x + b for all x

2. Ground truth answer says these are exactly the pairs where |a| = |b|

3. Proposed answer says these are exactly the pairs where a = b

The ground truth is correct because:
- If a = b, we can take f(x) = g(x) = x + a/2 (when a is even) or similar constructions
- The condition |a| = |b| is necessary because the functional equations imply that f and g must be bijections with inverses that are shifts by a and b respectively, forcing |a| = |b|

The proposed answer is too restrictive - it only includes the cases where a = b exactly, missing cases like (1,-1) or (2,-2) which satisfy |a| = |b| but not a = b.
