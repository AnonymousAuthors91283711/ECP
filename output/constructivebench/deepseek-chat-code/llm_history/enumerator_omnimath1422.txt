[write_program]
This problem involves finding all real values r that are outputs of a complex polynomial P(z) = z³ + z² - z + 2 for non-real complex inputs z. We'll write a Python program to numerically approximate these values by sampling complex numbers and evaluating P(z).

The approach:
1. Sample complex numbers z = a + bi where b ≠ 0
2. Compute P(z) and check if the imaginary part is approximately zero
3. Collect the real parts of such outputs
4. Identify distinct real values that appear

We'll use a grid search over a reasonable range of a and b values to find candidates.

```python
import cmath
import math

def P(z):
    return z**3 + z**2 - z + 2

def find_real_outputs():
    seen = set()
    # Sample a grid of complex numbers with non-zero imaginary part
    for a in [x * 0.1 for x in range(-20, 21)]:  # real part from -2 to 2
        for b in [x * 0.1 for x in range(1, 21)]:  # positive imaginary part
            z = complex(a, b)
            result = P(z)
            # Check if imaginary part is approximately zero
            if abs(result.imag) < 1e-8:
                real_part = round(result.real, 6)
                if real_part not in seen:
                    seen.add(real_part)
                    print(real_part)
            # Also check the conjugate
            z_conj = complex(a, -b)
            result_conj = P(z_conj)
            if abs(result_conj.imag) < 1e-8:
                real_part = round(result_conj.real, 6)
                if real_part not in seen:
                    seen.add(real_part)
                    print(real_part)
