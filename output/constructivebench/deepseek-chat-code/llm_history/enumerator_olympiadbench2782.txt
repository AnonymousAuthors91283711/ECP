This problem involves finding the smallest positive integer k such that (Complex.ofReal (-1) + i)^k equals Complex.ofReal (1/2^-8) (which is 256). We'll enumerate k values and compute the expression until we find a match.

The approach is:
1. Represent complex numbers using Python's complex type
2. Compute (-1 + 1j)^k for increasing k values
3. Check when the result equals 256 + 0j
4. Stop at the first match since we're looking for the minimal k

```python
import cmath

def main():
    # The complex number in question: -1 + i
    z = -1 + 1j
    # Target value: 256 + 0i
    target = 256 + 0j
    # Tolerance for floating point comparison
    tolerance = 1e-10
    
    k = 1
    while True:
        result = z ** k
        # Check if real part is approximately 256 and imaginary part is negligible
        if abs(result.real - target.real) < tolerance and abs(result.imag - target.imag) < tolerance:
            print(f"Found solution at k = {k}")
            break
        k += 1
        # Safety limit to prevent infinite loops
        if k > 1000:
            print("No solution found within k=1000")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
