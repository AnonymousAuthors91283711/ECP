This problem asks for the number of permutations π of {1,2,3,4,5} such that the sum ∑(π(i)*i) is divisible by 3. We'll enumerate all 5! = 120 permutations and count those satisfying the condition.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def solve():
    count = 0
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    for perm in permutations(numbers):
        total = sum((i+1)*x for i, x in enumerate(perm))  # i+1 because of 1-based indexing
        if total % 3 == 0:
            count += 1
            print(f"Found valid permutation {perm} with sum {total}")
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

solve()
```
