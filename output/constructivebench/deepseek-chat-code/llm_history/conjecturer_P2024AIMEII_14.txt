Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated answers, we observe that bases with exactly 3 beautiful numbers start appearing at base 7 and continue in a pattern. The first base with more than 10 beautiful numbers would be the smallest base where this condition holds. Based on the pattern, the answer is:

<<<23>>> 

Explanation: The enumeration shows bases 7,11,13,15,16,19,21,22 have exactly 3 beautiful numbers each. Base 23 is the next in this sequence and would be the first to exceed 10 beautiful numbers based on the observed pattern.
