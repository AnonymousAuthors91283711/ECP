Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), (2, 0, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1, 0), (2, 0, 2)}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but missing the trivial solution (0, 0, 0) where 0^5 + 0^4 + 1 = 1 = 3^0 * 7^0. The other two solutions are correct: (1,1,0) gives 1+1+1=3=3^1*7^0 and (2,0,2) gives 32+16+1=49=3^0*7^2.
