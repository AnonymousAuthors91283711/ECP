[write_program]
This problem involves simple algebraic manipulation with given values. We'll compute the expression (2*v - 5 - (2*x - 5)) where x=2 and v=3*x. The program will calculate this directly.

```python
# Given x=2 and v=3*x, compute 2*v - 5 - (2*x - 5)
x = 2
v = 3 * x
result = (2 * v - 5) - (2 * x - 5)
print(result)
```
