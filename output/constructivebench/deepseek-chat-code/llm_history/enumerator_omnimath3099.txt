This problem involves calculating a probability related to dice faces. We'll enumerate the given values and compute the probability expression step by step in Python.

The problem defines:
- faces = [2,3,4,5,6,7]
- oddFaces = [3,5,7]
- The probability expression combines two terms involving these values

We'll compute:
1. totalDots = sum of all faces
2. First term: sum over odd faces of (n-1)/totalDots
3. Second term: sum over odd faces of 1/(6*totalDots)
4. Final probability = first term + second term

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    faces = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    odd_faces = [3, 5, 7]
    total_dots = sum(faces)
    
    # Compute first term: sum over odd faces of (n-1)/total_dots
    first_term = sum(Fraction(n-1, total_dots) for n in odd_faces)
    
    # Compute second term: sum over odd faces of 1/(6*total_dots)
    second_term = sum(Fraction(1, 6*total_dots) for _ in odd_faces)
    
    # Total probability
    prob = first_term + second_term
    
    print(f"Total dots: {total_dots}")
    print(f"First term: {first_term}")
    print(f"Second term: {second_term}")
    print(f"Final probability: {prob} (exact: {prob.numerator}/{prob.denominator})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
