This problem appears to be about finding possible distributions of test scores under certain constraints. The problem states that for a multiset of 12 scores where each score is either even (2k) or odd (2k+1) with k ≤ 11, and the total sum is 132 (11*12), we need to determine which conditions make P2015AMCA_13_answer false exactly when n=4.

To approach this, we'll enumerate all possible score distributions that meet the constraints and analyze their properties. We'll focus on counting how many scores are odd (since each odd score contributes an extra +1 to the sum beyond its even counterpart).

```python
from itertools import combinations

def main():
    total_students = 12
    target_sum = 132
    
    # The minimal case is all scores being 2*0=0 (sum=0)
    # The maximal case is all scores being 2*11+1=23 (sum=276)
    # We need sum=132, which is exactly halfway (average=11)
    
    # Each odd score contributes +1 to the sum compared to its even counterpart
    # So number of odd scores must be (132 - even_sum)
    # Where even_sum is sum if all scores were even
    
    # Let's find possible counts of odd scores
    min_even_sum = 0  # all scores 0
    max_even_sum = 2*11*12  # all scores 22
    
    # The difference between target and even_sum must equal number of odd scores
    # So for possible odd counts o: 132 - (sum_evens) = o
    # => sum_evens = 132 - o
    
    # sum_evens must be even (since all evens are 2k)
    # So 132 - o must be even => o must be even
    
    # Also, o must be between 0 and 12
    possible_odd_counts = [o for o in range(0, 13) if (132 - o) % 2 == 0]
    
    print("Possible counts of odd scores:", possible_odd_counts)
    
    # Now let's verify for each possible odd count
    for o in possible_odd_counts:
        sum_evens = 132 - o
        avg_even = sum_evens / 12
        print(f"\nFor {o} odd scores:")
        print(f"  Required average of even scores: {avg_even}")
        
        # Check if this is achievable
        # Each even score is 2k (0 ≤ k ≤ 11)
        # So sum of evens must be between 0 and 2*11*(12-o)
        # Wait, no - the o odd scores can be any of the 12
        
        # Actually, the constraint is more complex
        # We need to find any combination where:
        # - exactly o scores are odd (2k+1)
        # - remaining 12-o scores are even (2k)
        # - total sum is 132
        
        # Let's try small o values to see patterns
        if o == 0:
            print("  All scores even, average must be exactly 11")
            print("  Example: all scores 2*5=10 and 2*6=12 in some combination")
        
        if o == 12:
            print("  All scores odd, average must be exactly 11")
            print("  Example: all scores 2*5+1=11")
        
        if o == 6:
            print("  6 odd, 6 even")
            print("  Example: 6 scores of 11 (2*5+1) and 6 scores of 10 (2*5)")
