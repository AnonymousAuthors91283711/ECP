n = 1 yields prime 43
n = 2 yields prime 47
n = 3 yields prime 53
n = 4 yields prime 61
n = 5 yields prime 71
n = 6 yields prime 83
n = 7 yields prime 97
n = 8 yields prime 113
n = 9 yields prime 131
n = 10 yields prime 151
n = 11 yields prime 173
n = 12 yields prime 197
n = 13 yields prime 223
n = 14 yields prime 251
n = 15 yields prime 281
n = 16 yields prime 313
n = 17 yields prime 347
n = 18 yields prime 383
n = 19 yields prime 421
n = 20 yields prime 461

Total numbers found: 20. Expected Answer Type: Prop
<<<∀ n : ℕ, n ≤ 40 → Prime (n^2 + n + 41)>>>
