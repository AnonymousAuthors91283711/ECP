This problem asks for the last digit of the sum of squares of numbers from 1×49 to 49×49. We can compute this efficiently by observing that we only need the last digit of each term, which depends on (k mod 10) since 49 mod 10 = 9. We'll compute (k*9)^2 mod 10 for k from 1 to 49 and sum them.

```python
def main():
    total = 0
    for k in range(1, 50):
        # Compute (k*9)^2 mod 10
        term = (k * 9) % 10
        term = (term * term) % 10
        total = (total + term) % 10
        print(f"After k={k}: sum mod 10 = {total}")
    
    print(f"Final answer: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
