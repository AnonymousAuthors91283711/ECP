[write_program]
This problem asks for all real-valued functions f: ℝ → ℝ that satisfy two conditions:
1. f(x+1) = f(x) + 1 (periodicity-like condition)
2. f(x²) = f(x)² (quadratic condition)

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible candidates by testing simple function forms. The most likely candidates are linear functions f(x) = x + c, but we need to verify which satisfy both conditions.

```python
def test_function(f, name):
    """Test if a function satisfies both conditions with some sample points"""
    samples = [-2.5, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3]
    condition1 = all(abs(f(x+1) - (f(x)+1)) < 1e-9 for x in samples)
    condition2 = all(abs(f(x**2) - f(x)**2) < 1e-9 for x in samples)
    if condition1 and condition2:
        print(f"Found candidate: {name}")

# Test identity function
test_function(lambda x: x, "f(x) = x")

# Test constant functions (won't satisfy first condition)
for c in [0, 1, -1]:
    test_function(lambda x, c=c: c, f"f(x) = {c}")

# Test linear functions f(x) = x + c
for c in [-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1]:
    test_function(lambda x, c=c: x + c, f"f(x) = x + {c}")

# Test piecewise functions (unlikely to satisfy both)
def piecewise1(x):
    return x if x >= 0 else -x
test_function(piecewise1, "f(x) = |x|")

def piecewise2(x):
    return x if x == int(x) else 0
test_function(piecewise2, "f(x) = x if integer else 0")

# After testing, we can conjecture the answer is only f(x) = x
print("\nAfter testing candidates, the only solution appears to be f(x) = x")
```
