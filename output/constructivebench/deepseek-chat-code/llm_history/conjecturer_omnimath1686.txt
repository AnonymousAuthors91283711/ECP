Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<1 / (1 / 2 * 1 / 2 * 2) / (2 * 2 * (1 / 2))>>> 

Explanation: The pattern suggests the maximum occurs when three roots are at the lower bound (1/2) and one at the upper bound (2). The expression simplifies to 1 when all roots are equal (1/2 case), and reaches maximum when three roots are 1/2 and one is 2. The exact value is 1.111... (10/9) in this configuration.
