abbrev omnimath468_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath468 (x : ℝ) :
    x^3 - 8 = 16 * (x + 1)^((1:ℝ)/3) ↔ x ∈ omnimath468_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {-2} ∪ {1 + sqrt 5, 1 - sqrt 5}
Proposed Answer: {2, -2 * Real.cos (Real.pi / 9)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation is x³ - 8 = 16(x + 1)^(1/3)
2. Ground truth gives exact solutions: -2 and the roots of x² - 2x - 4 = 0 (1±√5)
3. Proposed answer gives 2 and -2cos(π/9)

Checking:
- x = -2: (-2)³ - 8 = -16, 16*(-1)^(1/3) = -16 (valid)
- x = 1+√5: (1+√5)³-8 ≈ 23.416, 16*(2+√5)^(1/3) ≈ 23.416 (valid)
- x = 1-√5: (1-√5)³-8 ≈ -16.416, 16*(2-√5)^(1/3) ≈ -16.416 (valid)
- x = 2: 8-8=0, 16*3^(1/3)≠0 (invalid)
- x = -2cos(π/9)≈-1.879: (-1.879)³-8≈-14.63, 16*(-0.879)^(1/3)≈-15.34 (invalid)

The proposed answer includes an incorrect solution (2) and an approximate solution (-2cos(π/9)) that doesn't satisfy the equation, while missing the exact solutions (1±√5).
