The problem involves calculating handshakes between twins and triplets at a party. We need to compute the total number of handshakes considering:
- 9 pairs of twins (each pair counts as 2 people)
- 6 sets of triplets (each set counts as 3 people)
- Twins don't shake hands with their own twin
- Triplets don't shake hands with their own triplet siblings

The formula calculates:
1. Handshakes between twins and other non-twin people
2. Handshakes between triplets and other non-triplet people
3. Divides by 2 to avoid double-counting

Here's the Python program to compute this:

```python
def calculate_handshakes():
    twins = 9 * 2
    triplets = 6 * 3
    # Handshakes initiated by twins (with non-twins)
    twin_handshakes = 9 * (2 * (twins - 2) + 2 * (triplets // 2))
    # Handshakes initiated by triplets (with non-triplets)
    triplet_handshakes = 6 * (3 * (triplets - 3) + 3 * (twins // 2))
    total = (twin_handshakes + triplet_handshakes) // 2
    print(total)

calculate_handshakes()
```
