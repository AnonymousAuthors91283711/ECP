Ground Truth Answer: fun m n r s => (min (m : ℝ) (n : ℝ)) ^ (1/r - 1/s)
Proposed Answer: fun (m n : ℕ) (r s : ℝ) => (min m n : ℝ) ^ (1/r - 1/s)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both expressions:
1. Take natural numbers m and n, and real numbers r and s as inputs
2. Convert the minimum of m and n to a real number
3. Raise it to the power of (1/r - 1/s)

The only difference is stylistic:
- The ground truth answer explicitly casts m to ℝ before taking min
- The proposed answer takes min first then casts to ℝ
But mathematically, min (m:ℝ) (n:ℝ) = (min m n : ℝ), so they are equivalent.
