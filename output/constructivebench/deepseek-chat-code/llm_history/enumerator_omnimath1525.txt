[write_program]
This problem involves finding a closed-form expression for the sum of binomial coefficients multiplied by powers of 2. We'll write a Python program to compute this sum for small values of n and look for patterns.

The program will:
1. Compute the sum for n from 0 to 20
2. Print each n and its corresponding sum
3. The binomial coefficient is calculated using math.comb
4. The sum ranges over k from 0 to n//2 since choose(n-k,k) becomes 0 for larger k

```python
import math

def compute_sum(n):
    total = 0
    for k in range(0, n // 2 + 1):
        term = math.comb(n - k, k) * (2 ** k)
        total += term
    return total

max_n = 20
print(f"Computing sums for n from 0 to {max_n}:")
for n in range(0, max_n + 1):
    s = compute_sum(n)
    print(f"n = {n}: sum = {s}")
```
