This problem involves computing the value of 10! - 7! Ã— 6! and finding its exact value. The solution requires calculating factorials and performing the subtraction. We'll compute this directly in Python.

```python
import math

# Compute 10! - 7! * 6!
result = math.factorial(10) - math.factorial(7) * math.factorial(6)
print(result)
```
