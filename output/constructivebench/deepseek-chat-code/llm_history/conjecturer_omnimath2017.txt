Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the enumerated pairs, we observe that for each pair (a,b), the equation gcd(a,b)*a + b² = 10000 holds. The number of solutions corresponds to the number of positive divisors of 10000, since for each divisor d (which represents gcd(a,b)), we can find corresponding a and b values. Since 10000 = 2⁴ * 5⁴, it has (4+1)(4+1) = 25 positive divisors.
