[write_program]
This problem appears to be about determining whether a certain state transformation is possible using a sequence of operations. The operations involve decrementing and updating values in a state vector. We'll write a Python program to explore small cases and see if we can find patterns or counterexamples.

The program will:
1. Simulate the state updates for small sequences of operations
2. Track reachable states from the initial state
3. Print interesting states that are reachable or unreachable

```python
def main():
    # Define the operations
    def op1(state, j):
        if state[j] > 0:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state[j] -= 1
            new_state[j+1] += 2
            return new_state
        return state

    def op2(state, k):
        if state[k] > 0:
            new_state = state.copy()
            new_state[k] -= 1
            temp = new_state[k+1]
            new_state[k+1] = new_state[k+2]
            new_state[k+2] = temp
            return new_state
        return state

    # Initial state: [1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,...]
    initial_state = [1]*6 + [0]*4

    # We'll explore sequences of up to 3 operations
    max_ops = 3
    operations = []
    for i in range(5):
        operations.append(('op1', i))
    for i in range(4):
        operations.append(('op2', i))

    # BFS to explore reachable states
    visited = set()
    queue = [(initial_state, [])]
    visited.add(tuple(initial_state))

    while queue:
        current_state, path = queue.pop(0)
        print(f"State: {current_state[:10]} (path length: {len(path)})")
        
        if len(path) >= max_ops:
            continue
            
        for op in operations:
            new_state = current_state.copy()
            if op[0] == 'op1':
                new_state = op1(new_state, op[1])
            else:
                new_state = op2(new_state, op[1])
                
            state_tuple = tuple(new_state)
            if state_tuple not in visited:
                visited.add(state_tuple)
                queue.append((new_state, path + [op]))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
