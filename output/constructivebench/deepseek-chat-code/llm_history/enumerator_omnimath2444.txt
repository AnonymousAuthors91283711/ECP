[write_program]
The problem asks for the smallest natural number n â‰¥ 2 such that the set {2,3,...,n} cannot be partitioned into two disjoint subsets S and T where neither S nor T contains any triple (a,b,c) with a^b = c. We need to find the minimal such n.

We'll write a Python program to check this property for increasing values of n, stopping when we find the smallest n that satisfies the condition. For each n, we'll try all possible partitions of {2,...,n} into two sets and check if either set violates the condition.

```python
def main():
    max_n = 20  # Reasonable upper bound based on problem difficulty
    
    for n in range(2, max_n + 1):
        numbers = list(range(2, n + 1))
        found_partition = False
        
        # We'll represent partitions using bitmask (0=first set, 1=second set)
        for mask in range(0, 1 << (n - 1)):
            S = []
            T = []
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if mask & (1 << i):
                    T.append(numbers[i])
                else:
                    S.append(numbers[i])
            
            # Check both sets for a^b = c
            s_ok = True
            for a in S:
                for b in S:
                    c = a ** b
                    if c in S:
                        s_ok = False
                        break
                if not s_ok:
                    break
            
            t_ok = True
            for a in T:
                for b in T:
                    c = a ** b
                    if c in T:
                        t_ok = False
                        break
                if not t_ok:
                    break
            
            if s_ok and t_ok:
                found_partition = True
                break
        
        if not found_partition:
            print(f"Found minimal n with no valid partition: {n}")
            return
    
    print(f"No such n found up to {max_n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
