  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (n + 1 : ℚ) / (2 * n + 1) < 1 / 100} omnimath2061_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No solution found in range 1-1000. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the problem statement and the fact that no solution was found in the range 1-1000, we can deduce that the minimal n satisfying the inequality (n + 1)/(2n + 1) < 1/100 must be larger than 1000. Solving the inequality algebraically gives n > 99/0.98 ≈ 101.02, so the smallest integer solution is 102.
