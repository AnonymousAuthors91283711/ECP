[write_program]
This problem asks for the largest prime factor of 7999999999, given that it has at most 2 distinct prime factors. We'll write a Python program to factorize this number and find its largest prime factor.

The approach:
1. Check divisibility by small primes first (efficient trial division)
2. Since there are at most 2 distinct prime factors, once we find one factor, we can check if the remaining cofactor is prime
3. Output all prime factors found, then explicitly state the largest one

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if n is prime using trial division up to sqrt(n)"""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n in (2, 3):
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    max_div = int(n**0.5) + 1
    for d in range(3, max_div, 2):
        if n % d == 0:
            return False
    return True

def factorize(n):
    """Factorize n with at most 2 distinct prime factors"""
    factors = set()
    # Check divisibility by small primes first
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]:
        if n % p == 0:
            factors.add(p)
            while n % p == 0:
                n = n // p
            if n == 1:
                break
    # If we found one factor, check if remaining is prime
    if len(factors) == 1 and n > 1:
        if is_prime(n):
            factors.add(n)
    # If no factors found yet, check if n itself is prime
    elif not factors and n > 1:
        if is_prime(n):
            factors.add(n)
    return sorted(factors)

n = 7999999999
factors = factorize(n)
print(f"Prime factors of {n}: {factors}")
if factors:
    print(f"Largest prime factor: {max(factors)}")
else:
    print("No prime factors found (shouldn't happen for n > 1)")
```
