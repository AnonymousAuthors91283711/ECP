[write_program]
This problem involves finding numbers formed by digits 1 followed by n 2's and ending with 1, and checking which of these numbers are prime for n < 10. We'll write a Python program to enumerate these numbers and check their primality.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def generate_number(n):
    return int('1' + '2' * n + '1')

count = 0
for n in range(10):
    num = generate_number(n)
    if is_prime(num):
        print(f"n={n}: {num} is prime")
        count += 1
    else:
        print(f"n={n}: {num} is not prime")

print(f"Total primes found for n < 10: {count}")
```
