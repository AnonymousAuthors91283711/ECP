Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Looking at the pattern in the enumerated answers:
- For k=1, minimal s=4 (which is (1+1)^2)
- For k=2, minimal s=9 (which is (2+1)^2)
- For k=3, minimal s=16 (which is (3+1)^2)
- For k=4, the pattern suggests s=25 (which is (4+1)^2)

The minimal valid s appears to be (k+1)^2 for each k.
