Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0), (0, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4), (2, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {p : Fin 5 × Fin 5 | p.1 = p.2}
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is about finding all positions (p) in a 5×5 grid where you can toggle lights following certain rules to create a configuration where only p is lit. The ground truth answer gives specific positions, while the proposed answer suggests all positions on the main diagonal.

Key observations:
1. The ground truth includes (0,0), (4,4) (which are on the diagonal) but also (0,4), (4,0) (anti-diagonal) and (2,2) (center).
2. The proposed answer only includes diagonal positions like (0,0), (1,1), etc. but misses the other valid positions.
3. The center (2,2) is indeed on the diagonal, but the proposed answer would incorrectly include (1,1) and (3,3) which aren't in the ground truth.

The proposed answer is partially correct (it includes some valid positions) but misses others and includes invalid ones. Therefore:

<<<False>>>
