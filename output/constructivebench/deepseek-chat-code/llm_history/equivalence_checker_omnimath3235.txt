Ground Truth Answer: fun n => Odd n
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n % 2 = 1 ∨ n = 1
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is close but not exactly equivalent to the ground truth. The ground truth correctly states that the condition holds when n is odd (Odd n). The proposed answer states n % 2 = 1 (which is equivalent to Odd n) but also includes n = 1 as a separate case. Since n = 1 is already covered by n % 2 = 1 (as 1 is odd), the disjunction is redundant. The answers are semantically equivalent in terms of the conditions they describe, but the proposed answer includes unnecessary redundancy.
