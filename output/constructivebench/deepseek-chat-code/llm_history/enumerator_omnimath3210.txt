This problem involves solving a quadratic equation and then evaluating a simple expression. The equation is 2x² = 9x - 4 with the constraint x ≠ 4. We'll solve it by:
1. Finding roots of the quadratic equation
2. Filtering out x=4
3. Calculating 2x for the remaining root

The program will:
1. Compute the discriminant
2. Find both roots
3. Filter out x=4
4. Calculate 2x for the valid root

```python
import math

# Solve the quadratic equation 2x^2 - 9x + 4 = 0
a = 2
b = -9
c = 4

# Calculate discriminant
discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c

# Find both roots
root1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
root2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)

# Filter out x=4 and calculate 2x for the other root
if abs(root1 - 4) > 1e-9:  # account for floating point precision
    print(f"2x = {2*root1}")
else:
    print(f"2x = {2*root2}")
```
