[write_program]
This problem asks for the ratio of odd positive divisors of 21! to all positive divisors of 21!. We'll write a Python program to compute this ratio exactly by:

1. Calculating the prime factorization of 21!
2. Using the divisor count formula to find total divisors
3. Calculating the number of odd divisors by ignoring the power of 2 in the factorization

The exact ratio can be computed without enumerating all divisors, making the computation efficient.

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def prime_factors(n):
    """Return prime factorization of n! as a dictionary {prime: exponent}"""
    factors = {}
    for p in range(2, n+1):
        if all(p % d != 0 for d in range(2, int(math.sqrt(p)) + 1)):
            # p is prime, compute its exponent in n!
            exponent = 0
            power = p
            while power <= n:
                exponent += n // power
                power *= p
            factors[p] = exponent
    return factors

def count_divisors(factors):
    """Count total divisors from prime factorization"""
    count = 1
    for exp in factors.values():
        count *= (exp + 1)
    return count

def count_odd_divisors(factors):
    """Count odd divisors by ignoring factor of 2"""
    if 2 in factors:
        odd_factors = factors.copy()
        del odd_factors[2]
    else:
        odd_factors = factors
    return count_divisors(odd_factors)

n = 21
factors = prime_factors(n)
total_divisors = count_divisors(factors)
odd_divisors = count_odd_divisors(factors)
ratio = Fraction(odd_divisors, total_divisors)

print(f"Prime factorization of {n}!: {factors}")
print(f"Total divisors: {total_divisors}")
print(f"Odd divisors: {odd_divisors}")
print(f"Exact ratio: {ratio} = {float(ratio)}")
```
