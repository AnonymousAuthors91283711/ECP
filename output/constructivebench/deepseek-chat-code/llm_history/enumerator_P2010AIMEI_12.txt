[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest integer m â‰¥ 3 such that for any partition of the set {3,4,...,m} into two disjoint subsets A and B, at least one subset contains three numbers a,b,c where a*b = c. We'll write a Python program to check this property for increasing values of m.

The approach is:
1. For each m starting from 3 upwards
2. Generate all possible partitions of {3,...,m} into two sets
3. Check if either set contains a triple (a,b,c) with a*b = c
4. The first m where all partitions satisfy this condition is our answer

```python
from itertools import combinations

def find_min_m():
    m = 3
    while True:
        nums = list(range(3, m+1))
        found = True
        
        # We only need to check partitions up to half since (A,B) and (B,A) are symmetric
        for k in range(1, len(nums)//2 + 1):
            for indices in combinations(range(len(nums)), k):
                A = {nums[i] for i in indices}
                B = set(nums) - A
                
                # Check condition for A
                a_ok = False
                for a, b in combinations(A, 2):
                    if a * b in A:
                        a_ok = True
                        break
                if a_ok:
                    continue
                    
                # Check condition for B
                b_ok = False
                for a, b in combinations(B, 2):
                    if a * b in B:
                        b_ok = True
                        break
                        
                if not b_ok:
                    found = False
                    break
                    
            if not found:
                break
                
        if found:
            print(f"Found minimal m: {m}")
            return m
        else:
            print(f"m = {m} doesn't work")
            m += 1

find_min_m()
```
