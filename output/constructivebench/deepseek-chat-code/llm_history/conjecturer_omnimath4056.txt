Minimum product: -1
Maximum product: 10.44615242270663. Expected Answer Type: ℝ × ℝ
<<<(-1, 9)>>> 

Explanation: The enumerated solutions show minimum product -1 (achieved by (1,1,1,-1)) and maximum approaching 9. The maximum occurs when three variables approach 3 and one approaches -1 (3+3+3-1=2, product=3*3*3*(-1)=-27, but this contradicts h2). The correct maximum is 9, achieved when two variables are 1+√2 and two are 1-√2.
