This problem involves calculating the average number of divisors for numbers from 1 to 100. The mathematical expression computes the sum over all divisors d of 100, and for each number z from 1 to 100, counts how many times d divides z. This sum is then divided by the total number of divisor-number pairs.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Find all divisors of 100
2. Count how many numbers between 1 and 100 each divisor divides
3. Sum these counts
4. Calculate the average by dividing by the total number of pairs

```python
def main():
    n = 100
    # Find all divisors of n
    divisors = [d for d in range(1, n+1) if n % d == 0]
    total_pairs = len(divisors) * n
    total_count = 0
    
    for d in divisors:
        # Count numbers in 1..n divisible by d
        count = n // d
        total_count += count
    
    average = total_count / total_pairs
    print(f"Divisors of {n}: {divisors}")
    print(f"Total pairs: {total_pairs}")
    print(f"Total count: {total_count}")
    print(f"Average: {average}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
