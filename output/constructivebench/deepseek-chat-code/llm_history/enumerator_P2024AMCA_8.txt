[write_program]
The problem asks to count the number of real numbers θ in the interval [0, 2π] that satisfy the equation log(sin(3θ)) + log(cos(2θ)) = 0, which simplifies to sin(3θ)cos(2θ) = 1 (since log(a) + log(b) = log(ab) and log(1) = 0). 

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Enumerate candidate θ values by checking points where sin(3θ)cos(2θ) is close to 1
2. Verify exact solutions by checking if sin(3θ)cos(2θ) = 1 exactly
3. Count the number of valid solutions

```python
import math
from itertools import count

def find_solutions():
    solutions = []
    # Check 100,000 points for numerical approximation
    n_points = 100000
    for i in range(n_points + 1):
        theta = 2 * math.pi * i / n_points
        # Compute sin(3θ)cos(2θ)
        val = math.sin(3 * theta) * math.cos(2 * theta)
        # Check if close to 1 (with some tolerance)
        if abs(val - 1) < 1e-6:
            # Verify exact solution (sin(3θ)cos(2θ) = 1 requires both terms = 1)
            sin_val = math.sin(3 * theta)
            cos_val = math.cos(2 * theta)
            if abs(sin_val - 1) < 1e-9 and abs(cos_val - 1) < 1e-9:
                solutions.append(theta)
                print(f"Found solution: θ = {theta}")
    
    # Remove duplicates (due to floating point precision)
    unique_solutions = []
    for sol in solutions:
        # Round to 6 decimal places for comparison
        rounded = round(sol, 6)
        if all(abs(rounded - round(s, 6)) > 1e-6 for s in unique_solutions):
            unique_solutions.append(sol)
    
    print(f"Total unique solutions found: {len(unique_solutions)}")

find_solutions()
```
