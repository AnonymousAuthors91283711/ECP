Ground Truth Answer: {3, 1, -1, 1 + Real.sqrt 2, 1 - Real.sqrt 2}
Proposed Answer: { -1, 1 - Real.sqrt 2, 1, 1 + Real.sqrt 2, 3 }
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer contains exactly the same elements as the ground truth answer, just in a different order. The order of elements in a set does not matter in mathematics, as sets are unordered collections. Both answers correctly list all real numbers x that satisfy f(f(f(x))) = 3 for the given function f(x) = x² - 2x.
