<<<999999 - 999 + 99 - 9>>>

Explanation: The pattern counts numbers <1M divisible by cubes >1. Total numbers <1M is 999999. Subtract numbers not divisible by any cube >1 (999 - 99 + 9), using inclusion-exclusion for cubes of primes 2-997. The expression simplifies to 999999 - (10^3-1) + (10^2-1) - (10^1-1).
