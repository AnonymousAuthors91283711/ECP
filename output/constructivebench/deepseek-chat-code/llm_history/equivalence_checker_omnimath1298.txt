Ground Truth Answer: fun (n, m) => if Even n ∨ Even m then choose (n + m) n else 0
Proposed Answer: fun (n, m) => choose (n + m) n - choose (n + m) (n + 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting certain binary paths (functions from Fin(n+m) to Bool) with specific constraints on the counts of true/false values and parity conditions.

2. The ground truth answer states:
   - If either n or m is even, the count is (n+m choose n)
   - Otherwise, the count is 0

3. The proposed answer gives a different formula: (n+m choose n) - (n+m choose n+1)

Key observations:
- When n or m is even, the proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth unless (n+m choose n+1) = 0, which isn't generally true.
- When both are odd, the proposed answer might coincidentally give 0 in some cases but not systematically.
- The proposed answer seems to be trying to subtract "invalid" paths, but the condition isn't correctly capturing the parity constraints.

The answers are not equivalent in general.
