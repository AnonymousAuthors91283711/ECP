This problem involves finding the largest subset of a 6×6 grid where no two distinct points share the same difference in x-coordinates and y-coordinates (both normal and reversed differences). We need to find the maximum size n of such a subset and count how many such subsets exist (k), with n + k = 74.

We'll approach this by:
1. Generating all possible subsets of the 6×6 grid
2. Checking the difference conditions
3. Tracking the maximum size found and counting how many achieve this maximum

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_valid_subset(subset):
    """Check if subset satisfies the difference conditions"""
    for p in subset:
        for q in subset:
            if p == q:
                continue
            dx = p[0] - q[0]
            dy = p[1] - q[1]
            if dx == dy or dx == -dy:
                return False
    return True

def solve():
    grid = [(i, j) for i in range(6) for j in range(6)]
    max_size = 0
    count = 0
    
    # Check sizes from largest to smallest
    for size in range(len(grid), 0, -1):
        found = False
        for subset in combinations(grid, size):
            if is_valid_subset(subset):
                if not found:
                    max_size = size
                    found = True
                    count = 0
                count += 1
                # Print each valid subset found (optional)
                # print(subset)
        
        if found:
            print(f"Maximum size: {max_size}")
            print(f"Number of maximum subsets: {count}")
            print(f"Sum: {max_size + count}")
            return
    
    print("No valid subsets found")

solve()
```

Note: This brute-force approach is computationally expensive for size=6 (36 choose n combinations). In practice, you'd want to optimize or use mathematical insights, but this demonstrates the enumeration approach. The actual solution would involve recognizing this as a problem about mutually non-attacking queens (where n=6 gives maximum independent set size 6, with 4 such sets, making 6+4=10 ≠ 74 - suggesting the original problem might have different parameters).
