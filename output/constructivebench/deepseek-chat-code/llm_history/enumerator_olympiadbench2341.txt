This problem involves calculating the percentage of acid in the remaining mixture after removing 60 units of a 25% acid solution from three initial solutions. The Python program will compute the exact value by following the given formulas.

```python
def calculate_remaining_acid_percentage():
    # Initial solution parameters
    A_total = 40.0
    A_acid = 0.1 * A_total
    B_total = 50.0
    B_acid = 0.2 * B_total
    C_total = 50.0
    C_acid = 0.3 * C_total
    
    # New mix parameters
    new_mix_total = 60.0
    new_mix_acid = 0.25 * new_mix_total
    
    # Calculate remaining quantities
    remaining_total = (A_total + B_total + C_total) - new_mix_total
    remaining_acid = (A_acid + B_acid + C_acid) - new_mix_acid
    
    # Compute and print the percentage
    percentage = (remaining_acid / remaining_total) * 100
    print(percentage)

calculate_remaining_acid_percentage()
```
