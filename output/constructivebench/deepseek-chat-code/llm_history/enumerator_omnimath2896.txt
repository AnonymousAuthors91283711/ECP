[write_program]
This problem involves counting the number of distinct odd integers in the set {d + d, (e + e) * d, d * d, d * (e + d)} where d is odd and e is even. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible combinations of small odd d and even e values, compute the set elements, and count the distinct odd results.

```python
def is_odd(x):
    return x % 2 != 0

def count_distinct_odds(d, e):
    elements = {
        d + d,
        (e + e) * d,
        d * d,
        d * (e + d)
    }
    odd_elements = [x for x in elements if is_odd(x)]
    return len(odd_elements)

# Test with small sample values
for d in range(-3, 5, 2):  # odd d values
    for e in range(-4, 5, 2):  # even e values
        count = count_distinct_odds(d, e)
        print(f"d={d}, e={e}: {count} distinct odd elements")
```
