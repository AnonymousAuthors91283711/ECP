[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimal real part of complex numbers x and y satisfying two polynomial equations. We'll approach it by:
1. Considering real solutions first (where y.imag = x.imag = 0)
2. Enumerating possible real solutions numerically
3. Checking for minimal real part among solutions

The program will:
- Define the equations as functions
- Use numerical root-finding for real solutions
- Track the minimal real part found

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

def equations(vars):
    x, y = vars
    eq1 = x + 2*y**2 - x**4
    eq2 = y + 2*x**2 - y**4
    return [eq1, eq2]

# Initial guesses covering different regions
initial_guesses = [
    (0, 0), (1, 1), (-1, -1),
    (0.5, 0.5), (-0.5, -0.5),
    (1.5, 1.5), (-1.5, -1.5)
]

min_real = float('inf')
solutions = set()

for guess in initial_guesses:
    sol = fsolve(equations, guess)
    x, y = sol
    # Round to handle numerical precision
    x_rounded = round(x, 6)
    y_rounded = round(y, 6)
    solution = (x_rounded, y_rounded)
    
    if solution not in solutions:
        solutions.add(solution)
        print(f"Found solution: x={x_rounded}, y={y_rounded}")
        if x_rounded < min_real:
            min_real = x_rounded
            print(f"New minimum real part: {min_real}")

print("\nFinal minimal real part found:", min_real)
```
