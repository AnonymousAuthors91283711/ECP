This problem involves solving for the value of \(3^{x+2}\) given that \(3^x = 5\). We can use the property of exponents to rewrite \(3^{x+2}\) as \(3^x \cdot 3^2 = 5 \cdot 9 = 45\). 

To verify this, we'll write a Python program that calculates \(3^{x+2}\) by first solving for \(x\) from \(3^x = 5\) (using logarithms) and then computing \(3^{x+2}\). The program will print the exact value (45) and the computed approximation for verification.

```python
import math

# Given 3^x = 5, solve for x using logarithms
x = math.log(5) / math.log(3)

# Compute 3^(x+2) = 3^x * 3^2 = 5 * 9 = 45
result = math.pow(3, x + 2)

print(f"Exact value: 45")
print(f"Computed approximation: {result}")
```
