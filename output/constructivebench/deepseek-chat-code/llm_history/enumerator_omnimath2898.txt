The problem appears to be finding the maximum value among the results of basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation) between the numbers 4 and 2. The solution should enumerate all possible operations and identify the maximum result.

Here's a Python program that calculates all possible operations between 4 and 2 and finds the maximum value:

```python
def enumerate_operations():
    a = 4
    b = 2
    operations = [
        ('4^2', a ** b),
        ('4*2', a * b),
        ('4-2', a - b),
        ('4/2', a / b),
        ('4+2', a + b)
    ]
    
    # Print all operations and their results
    for op, result in operations:
        print(f"{op} = {result}")
    
    # Find and print the maximum result
    max_op, max_result = max(operations, key=lambda x: x[1])
    print(f"\nMaximum value is {max_result} from operation {max_op}")

enumerate_operations()
```

The program:
1. Defines the two numbers (4 and 2)
2. Creates a list of tuples containing operation descriptions and their results
3. Prints all operations and their results
4. Finds and prints the maximum value among all operations

The output will show all possible operations and their results, followed by the maximum value found. The operations are exponentiation (4^2), multiplication (4*2), subtraction (4-2), division (4/2), and addition (4+2).
