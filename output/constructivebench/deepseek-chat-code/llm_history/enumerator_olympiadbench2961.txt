This problem asks for the greatest natural number `n` that can be expressed as `A*7^2 + B*7 + A` where `A` and `B` are distinct digits (0-6) in base 7. We'll enumerate all possible combinations of A and B (0-6, A≠B) and find the maximum value.

```python
def main():
    max_n = 0
    for A in range(7):
        for B in range(7):
            if A != B:
                n = A * 49 + B * 7 + A
                print(f"A={A}, B={B} → n={n}")
                if n > max_n:
                    max_n = n
    print(f"Maximum n: {max_n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
