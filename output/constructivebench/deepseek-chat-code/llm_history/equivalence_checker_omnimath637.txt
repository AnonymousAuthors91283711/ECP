Ground Truth Answer: 4 - 2 * Real.sqrt 3
Proposed Answer: 2 * (sqrt 2 - 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a predicate P(x,y,z) with constraints:
   - 0 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ 4
   - x² + 2 = y²
   - y² + 2 = z²

2. We can solve these equations:
   - y = √(x² + 2)
   - z = √(y² + 2) = √(x² + 4)

3. The expression to minimize is |x-y| + |y-z| = (y-x) + (z-y) = z - x (since x ≤ y ≤ z)

4. Substituting z = √(x² + 4), we need to minimize √(x² + 4) - x

5. The minimum occurs at the largest possible x (since the derivative is positive), which is when z=4:
   - x² + 4 = 16 ⇒ x = 2√3
   - Then z - x = 4 - 2√3

The ground truth answer (4 - 2√3) matches this derivation. The proposed answer (2*(√2 - 1)) evaluates to approximately 0.828, while the correct answer evaluates to approximately 0.536. They are not equal.
