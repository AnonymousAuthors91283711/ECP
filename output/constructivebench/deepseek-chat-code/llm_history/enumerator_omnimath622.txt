This problem asks for the greatest integer d such that there exists a quadratic function f(x) = ax² + bx + c with integer coefficients and three distinct integer roots u, v, w where f(u)=f(v)=0 and f(w)=2. The discriminant d is defined as b² - 4ac.

We'll enumerate possible quadratic functions with small coefficients that satisfy the conditions, compute their discriminants, and track the maximum found.

```python
def find_max_d():
    max_d = -float('inf')
    # Reasonable bounds for coefficients based on problem constraints
    for a in range(-10, 11):
        if a == 0:
            continue  # Not quadratic
        for b in range(-20, 21):
            for c in range(-20, 21):
                # Find distinct integers u,v,w where f(u)=f(v)=0, f(w)=2
                found = False
                roots = []
                # Check possible roots in a reasonable range
                for x in range(-10, 11):
                    if a*x*x + b*x + c == 0:
                        roots.append(x)
                        if len(roots) >= 2:
                            break
                if len(roots) >= 2:
                    u, v = roots[0], roots[1]
                    # Check for w ≠ u,v where f(w)=2
                    for w in range(-10, 11):
                        if w != u and w != v and a*w*w + b*w + c == 2:
                            d = b*b - 4*a*c
                            if d > max_d:
                                max_d = d
                                print(f"New max d={d} with a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, roots={u},{v}, w={w}")
                            found = True
                            break
    print(f"Final maximum discriminant: {max_d}")
