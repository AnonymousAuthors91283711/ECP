[write_program]
This problem is about characterizing the set of real-valued functions that tend to infinity as their input tends to infinity. We'll write a Python program to enumerate simple functions that satisfy this property, which can help in conjecturing the general answer.

The program will generate and test various elementary functions that grow to infinity, including polynomials, exponentials, and other common functions. We'll use numerical approximation to verify the limit behavior.

```python
import math

def test_tendsto_infinity(f, threshold=1e6, step=1000):
    """Check if f(x) tends to infinity as x -> infinity numerically"""
    for x in range(step, 10*step + 1, step):
        if f(x) < threshold:
            return False
        threshold = f(x)  # Ensure monotonic growth
    return True

# Define various candidate functions
functions = [
    ("Linear", lambda x: x),
    ("Quadratic", lambda x: x**2),
    ("Cubic", lambda x: x**3),
    ("Exponential", lambda x: math.exp(x)),
    ("Logarithmic", lambda x: math.log(x)),  # Doesn't tend to infinity
    ("Square root", lambda x: math.sqrt(x)),
    ("Factorial", lambda x: math.factorial(int(x)) if x < 20 else float('inf')),
    ("x*log(x)", lambda x: x * math.log(x) if x > 0 else 0),
    ("2^x", lambda x: 2**x),
    ("x^x", lambda x: x**x if x < 20 else float('inf'))
]

# Test each function and print those that tend to infinity
print("Functions that tend to infinity:")
for name, f in functions:
    if test_tendsto_infinity(f):
        print(f"- {name}")
    else:
        print(f"- {name} (does not tend to infinity)")
```
