Ground Truth Answer: True
Proposed Answer: ∃ (n : ℕ), n ≥ 53 ∧ ∃ (l : List ℕ), l.length = 2017 ∧ (∀ x ∈ l, ∃ k, x = k^2) ∧ l.sum = n ∧ 2017 ≤ Nat.card {s : Multiset ℕ | s.card = 2017 ∧ (∀ x ∈ s, ∃ k, x = k^2) ∧ s.sum = n}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but adds an additional constraint `n ≥ 53` which is not present in the ground truth. The ground truth simply requires the existence of some natural number `n` satisfying the conditions, while the proposed answer restricts this to numbers ≥ 53. This makes the answers not fully equivalent, though the proposed answer is correct in spirit (since any such `n` would indeed be ≥ 53, as it's the sum of 2017 squares).
