Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ (c k : ℝ), (StrictMono f ∨ StrictAnti f) ∧ 
    (∀ x > 0, f x = c * log x) ∨ (∀ x > 0, f x = c * x ^ k)}
Proposed Answer: {f | (∃ (c : ℝ), f = fun x => x^c) ∨ (f = Real.log)}
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. The ground truth answer includes two cases:
   - f(x) = c * log x (logarithmic case)
   - f(x) = c * x^k (power function case)

2. The proposed answer has:
   - f(x) = x^c (power function case, equivalent to c * x^k if we consider c=1)
   - f(x) = log x (logarithmic case with c=1)

The differences are:
- The proposed answer misses the multiplicative constant 'c' in both cases
- The power function case in the proposed answer is more restrictive (only x^c instead of c*x^k)

Therefore, the proposed answer is a strict subset of the ground truth answer, missing important cases.
