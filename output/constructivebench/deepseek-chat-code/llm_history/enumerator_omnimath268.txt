[write_program]
This problem asks to find all non-negative integer sequences of length 14 whose fourth powers sum to 1599. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such sequences efficiently.

The approach:
1. Since 5^4 = 625 and 6^4 = 1296, the maximum possible value in any position is 5 (since 6^4 alone exceeds the total sum)
2. We'll use a recursive backtracking approach with pruning to avoid unnecessary branches
3. The program will output each valid sequence as it finds them

```python
import sys

def find_sequences():
    target = 1599
    length = 14
    max_val = 5  # since 6^4 = 1296, and 2*1296 > 1599
    
    def backtrack(position, current_sum, current_sequence, remaining_positions):
        if position == length:
            if current_sum == target:
                print(current_sequence)
            return
        
        max_possible = min(max_val, int((target - current_sum) ** 0.25) + 1)
        for num in range(max_possible, -1, -1):
            new_sum = current_sum + num**4
            if new_sum > target:
                continue
            remaining_positions_after = remaining_positions - 1
            max_remaining = remaining_positions_after * (max_val**4)
            if new_sum + max_remaining < target:
                continue
            backtrack(position + 1, new_sum, current_sequence + [num], remaining_positions_after)
    
    backtrack(0, 0, [], length)

find_sequences()
```
