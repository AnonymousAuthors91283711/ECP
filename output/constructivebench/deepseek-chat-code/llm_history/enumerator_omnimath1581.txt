[write_program]
The problem involves a recursive function f(n) and asks for the sum of all x+1 (for x from 0 to 2018) where f(x+1) equals 19. The function f(n) is defined with base cases f(0)=0, f(1)=1, and for nâ‰¥2, it's 2*f(n/2) if n is even, otherwise 2*f(n/2)-1.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Implement the recursive function f(n)
2. Iterate through x from 0 to 2018
3. Check if f(x+1) equals 19
4. Sum all qualifying (x+1) values

```python
def f(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * f(n // 2)
    else:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) - 1

total = 0
for x in range(2019):
    n = x + 1
    if f(n) == 19:
        print(f"Found match at x={x}, n={n}")
        total += n

print(f"Final sum: {total}")
```
