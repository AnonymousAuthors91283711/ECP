This problem asks to find a 5-element subset of {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} whose product equals some special value (omnimath667_answer), and there exists another 5-element subset with the same product but different parity in their sums.

We'll enumerate all 5-element subsets, compute their products and sum parities, then look for pairs with matching products but differing sum parities.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def main():
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    size = 5
    subsets = {}
    
    for s in combinations(numbers, size):
        prod = 1
        for n in s:
            prod *= n
        sum_parity = sum(s) % 2
        if prod not in subsets:
            subsets[prod] = set()
        subsets[prod].add(sum_parity)
        
        # Check if this product has both parities
        if len(subsets[prod]) > 1:
            print(f"Found candidate product {prod} with both parities")
    
    # Find all products with both parities
    valid_products = [p for p in subsets if len(subsets[p]) > 1]
    print("\nAll valid products with both parities:", sorted(valid_products))
    
    # The minimal such product would be the answer
    if valid_products:
        print("\nMinimal valid product:", min(valid_products))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
