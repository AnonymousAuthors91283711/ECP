[write_program]
This problem asks for a function f: ℕ → ℕ where:
1. For all n > 0, the sum of f(k) from k=1 to n is a perfect square
2. For all n > 0, f(n) divides n³

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible functions f that satisfy these conditions for small n values, looking for patterns.

```python
import math

def is_square(x):
    s = int(math.isqrt(x))
    return s * s == x

def find_functions(max_n):
    # We'll build f incrementally, checking conditions at each step
    # f[0] is unused (since problem starts at n=1)
    solutions = [[]]  # Start with empty partial solution
    
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        new_solutions = []
        n_cubed = n ** 3
        # Find all divisors of n³ that could be f(n)
        possible_f_n = []
        for d in range(1, n_cubed + 1):
            if n_cubed % d == 0:
                possible_f_n.append(d)
        
        for partial in solutions:
            current_sum = sum(partial)
            for f_n in possible_f_n:
                new_sum = current_sum + f_n
                if is_square(new_sum):
                    new_solutions.append(partial + [f_n])
        
        solutions = new_solutions
        if not solutions:
            print(f"No solutions exist for n={n}")
            return
        
        print(f"For n={n}, found {len(solutions)} possible functions:")
        for i, f in enumerate(solutions[:3]):  # Print first 3 solutions
            print(f"  Solution {i+1}: {f}")
        if len(solutions) > 3:
            print(f"  ... and {len(solutions)-3} more")

find_functions(8)
```
