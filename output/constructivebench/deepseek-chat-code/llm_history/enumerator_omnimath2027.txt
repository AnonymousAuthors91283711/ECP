This problem involves finding the value of the product (p(α)-1)*p(α)*p(p(α))*p(p(p(α))) where p(x) = x² - x + 1 and p(p(p(p(α)))) = α. We'll explore this by:

1. Finding fixed points of p (where p(α) = α)
2. Finding cycles of length 2 (where p(p(α)) = α)
3. Finding cycles of length 4 (where p(p(p(p(α)))) = α)
4. Computing the product for each valid α

```python
def p(x):
    return x**2 - x + 1

def find_fixed_points():
    # Solve p(x) = x => x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 => (x-1)^2 = 0
    return [1.0]

def find_cycles_2():
    # Solve p(p(x)) = x
    # p(p(x)) = (x^2 - x + 1)^2 - (x^2 - x + 1) + 1 = x
    # Expanded: x^4 - 2x^3 + 2x^2 - x + 1 = x
    # => x^4 - 2x^3 + 2x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0
    # Factor: (x^2 - x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1) - x^2 = 0
    # Solutions: x=0 and x=1 (double root)
    return [0.0, 1.0]

def find_cycles_4():
    # Solve p(p(p(p(x)))) = x
    # We'll find roots numerically since exact form is complex
    # We know fixed points and 2-cycles are also 4-cycles
    known = set(find_fixed_points() + find_cycles_2())
    
    # Find additional 4-cycles that aren't fixed points or 2-cycles
    # Let's sample points and check p^4(x) ≈ x
    candidates = []
    for x in [i/100 for i in range(-200, 300)]:
        p4 = p(p(p(p(x))))
        if abs(p4 - x) < 1e-6 and not any(abs(x - k) < 1e-6 for k in known):
            candidates.append(x)
    
    # Remove duplicates (numerical precision issues)
    unique = []
    for c in candidates:
        if not any(abs(c - u) < 1e-6 for u in unique):
            unique.append(c)
    return unique

def compute_product(alpha):
    pa = p(alpha)
    ppa = p(pa)
    pppa = p(ppa)
    return (pa - 1) * pa * ppa * pppa

def main():
    print("Exploring fixed points (p(α)=α):")
    for alpha in find_fixed_points():
        prod = compute_product(alpha)
        print(f"α = {alpha}, product = {prod}")

    print("\nExploring 2-cycles (p(p(α))=α):")

        print(f"α = {alpha}, product = {prod}")

    print("\nExploring 4-cycles (p(p(p(p(α))))=α):")
    cycles_4 = find_cycles_4()
    for alpha in cycles_4:

        print(f"α = {alpha}, product = {prod}")

    if cycles_4:
