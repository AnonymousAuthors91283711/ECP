Ground Truth Answer: {m : ℕ | ¬Squarefree m}
Proposed Answer: {m : ℕ | m > 1}
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the set of natural numbers m > 0 where:
   - There exists integer sequences a and g such that (aₙ - gₙ) is divisible by m for all n
   - But (a₂ - a₁) is NOT divisible by m

2. The ground truth answer says this set equals numbers that are not squarefree (numbers divisible by p² for some prime p)

3. The proposed answer says this set equals all numbers greater than 1

Analysis:
- The proposed answer {m | m > 1} is too broad. For example:
  - m=2 (squarefree) shouldn't be in the set, but is included in the proposed answer
  - m=4 (not squarefree) should be in the set, and is included in both answers
- The condition requires m to have a certain divisibility property (related to squarefreeness), not just being >1
- The ground truth correctly captures that we need m to have a squared prime factor

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect as it includes too many numbers.
