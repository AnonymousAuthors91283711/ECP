Ground Truth Answer: 7 / (2 * sqrt 30)
Proposed Answer: 1 / sqrt 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a system of three equations involving a, b, c with square root terms.
2. The ground truth answer is 7/(2*sqrt(30)) ≈ 0.639
3. The proposed answer is 1/sqrt(3) ≈ 0.577

These are clearly different numerical values, and there's no obvious simplification or transformation that would make them equivalent. The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the given equations when substituted back.
