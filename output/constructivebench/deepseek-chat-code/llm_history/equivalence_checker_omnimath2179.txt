Ground Truth Answer: 6 * 5 * 4 * (6 * 5 * 4 / 6)
Proposed Answer: 6 * 5 * 4 * 5 * 4 * 4 / 6
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
We need to count the number of 3-element subsets of a 6×6 grid where:
1. No two elements share the same row
2. No two elements share the same column
This is equivalent to selecting 3 distinct rows, 3 distinct columns, and then pairing them up.

Ground Truth Answer:
6 * 5 * 4 (ways to choose 3 distinct rows) * (6 * 5 * 4 / 6) (ways to choose columns divided by symmetry)

Proposed Answer:
6 * 5 * 4 * 5 * 4 * 4 / 6

Comparison:
The ground truth correctly counts:
1. Choose rows: 6*5*4
2. Choose columns: 6*5*4 (all permutations)
3. Divide by 6 (for permutation symmetry of the 3 points)

The proposed answer incorrectly multiplies by 5*4*4 for columns, which doesn't make sense combinatorially. The correct column count should be 6*5*4 (all permutations of 3 columns from 6).
