Ground Truth Answer: { (x, y) | x^2 + y^2 = 1 } ∪ { (x, y) | y^2 - x^2 = 1 }
Proposed Answer: {p : ℝ × ℝ | (p.1^2 = p.2^2 - 1 ∧ p.2^2 ≥ 1) ∨ (p.1^2 = -p.2^2 + 1 ∧ p.2^2 ≤ 1)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully:

1. The original equation is y⁴ + 1 = x⁴ + 2y²
2. Let's rearrange it: y⁴ - 2y² + 1 = x⁴
3. The left side can be rewritten as (y² - 1)² = x⁴

Now let's compare the answers:

Ground Truth:
- First set: x² + y² = 1 (circle)
- Second set: y² - x² = 1 (hyperbola)

Proposed Answer:
- First case: x² = y² - 1 (equivalent to y² - x² = 1) with y² ≥ 1
- Second case: x² = -y² + 1 (equivalent to x² + y² = 1) with y² ≤ 1

The proposed answer is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth, but with additional constraints (y² ≥ 1 and y² ≤ 1) that are actually implied by the equations themselves:

1. For y² - x² = 1, since x² ≥ 0, y² must be ≥ 1
2. For x² + y² = 1, since x² ≥ 0, y² must be ≤ 1

Therefore, the answers are equivalent.
