The problem asks to find the pair (a, b) with 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 100 such that (a+b)(a+b+1) is divisible by a*b, and b is maximized. We need to enumerate all valid pairs and identify the one with maximal b.

Here's a Python program that efficiently checks all possible pairs and outputs valid ones, then identifies the pair with maximum b:

```python
def find_pairs(max_n=100):
    max_b_pair = (0, 0)
    for a in range(1, max_n + 1):
        for b in range(a, max_n + 1):
            s = a + b
            product = s * (s + 1)
            if product % (a * b) == 0:
                print(f"Found valid pair: ({a}, {b})")
                if b > max_b_pair[1]:
                    max_b_pair = (a, b)
    print(f"\nPair with maximum b: {max_b_pair}")

find_pairs()
```

The program:
1. Iterates through all possible a (1 to 100)
2. For each a, iterates through b (a to 100)
3. Checks if (a+b)(a+b+1) is divisible by a*b
4. Prints valid pairs as they are found
5. Keeps track of the pair with maximum b
6. Finally prints the pair with largest b found

The output will show all valid pairs and the final maximal solution. The program efficiently checks divisibility without unnecessary computations.
