[write_program]
This problem asks to find all pairs of coprime odd natural numbers (m, n) such that their sum is a power of 2. We'll write a Python program to enumerate such pairs up to a reasonable threshold.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible powers of 2 (2^k)
2. For each power, find all pairs (m, n) where m + n = 2^k
3. Check if m and n are coprime and both odd
4. Print valid pairs as we find them

```python
import math

def is_power_of_two(x):
    return (x & (x - 1)) == 0

def main():
    max_k = 20  # 2^20 is large enough for demonstration
    found_pairs = set()
    
    for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
        s = 2 ** k
        # We only need to check m up to s//2 to avoid duplicates
        for m in range(1, s // 2 + 1):
            n = s - m
            if math.gcd(m, n) == 1 and m % 2 == 1 and n % 2 == 1:
                # Avoid duplicate pairs by ordering
                if (m, n) not in found_pairs and (n, m) not in found_pairs:
                    found_pairs.add((m, n))
                    print(f"Found pair: ({m}, {n}), sum = 2^{k}")
    
    print("\nAll found pairs:")
    for pair in sorted(found_pairs):
        print(pair)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
