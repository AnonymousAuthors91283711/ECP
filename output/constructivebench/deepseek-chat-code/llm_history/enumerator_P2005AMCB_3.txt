[write_program]
This problem involves finding a rational number that satisfies a given equation involving variables M and C. The Python program will enumerate possible rational values for p and verify the condition (M/5 = p*(C/3)) for small positive integer values of M and C, then compute the expression (M - p*C)/M to find the consistent answer.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def find_consistent_answer():
    # Try small positive integer values for M and C
    for M in range(1, 6):
        for C in range(1, 6):
            # Calculate p from the equation M/5 = p*(C/3)
            try:
                p = Fraction(M, 5) / Fraction(C, 3)
                # Compute the expression (M - p*C)/M
                result = (Fraction(M) - p * Fraction(C)) / Fraction(M)
                print(f"M={M}, C={C}, p={p}, result={result}")
            except ZeroDivisionError:
                continue

    # After enumerating cases, we can observe the consistent result is 2/5
    # But we don't hardcode this - the enumeration shows it's consistent across cases
