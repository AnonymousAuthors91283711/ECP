Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: 48
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a 4×4 matrix M where each entry M i j is defined as M₀₀ + j + 7i (with i,j ∈ {0,1,2,3}).

2. We then create a modified matrix M' where rows 1 and 3 are reversed (j becomes 3-j for these rows).

3. We calculate two diagonal sums (main diagonal and anti-diagonal) of M' and take their absolute difference.

4. The ground truth answer is 4, while the proposed answer is 48.

To verify:
- The difference between diagonals should indeed be constant (independent of M₀₀) due to the linear structure.
- Calculating with specific values shows the difference is indeed 4 (for example, try M₀₀=0 and compute both diagonals).
- The proposed answer 48 is incorrect - it's likely a miscalculation where someone forgot to account for the absolute value or made an error in summing the diagonals.
