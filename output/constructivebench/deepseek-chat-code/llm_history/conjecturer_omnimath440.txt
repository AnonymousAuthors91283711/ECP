open Function Nat

abbrev omnimath440_answer : Set (ℕ → ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath440 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ n, f (n !) = (f n) !) ∧ (∀ m n, m ≠ n → m - n ∣ f m - f n) ↔ f ∈ omnimath440_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking constant functions:
Found valid constant function: f(n) = 1
Found valid constant function: f(n) = 2

Checking identity function:
Found valid function: f(n) = n

Checking factorial function:
Factorial function doesn't satisfy conditions

Based on small values, possible solutions are:
- Constant functions f(n) = 0 and f(n) = 1
- Identity function f(n) = n. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ → ℕ)
<<<{fun _ => 0, fun _ => 1, fun n => n}>>>
