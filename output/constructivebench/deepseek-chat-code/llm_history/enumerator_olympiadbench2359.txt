[write_program]
This problem asks to find the unique positive real number x where x multiplied by its floor equals 17. We'll write a Python program to find this value by checking possible integer floor values and solving for x.

The approach:
1. Since x > 0 and floor(x) must be an integer, let n = floor(x)
2. Then n ≤ x < n+1
3. The equation becomes x*n = 17 ⇒ x = 17/n
4. We need n ≤ 17/n < n+1
5. We'll check integer values of n until we find the solution

```python
import math

def find_x():
    for n in range(1, 18):  # Check possible floor values from 1 to 17
        x = 17 / n
        if n <= x < n + 1:
            print(f"Found solution: x = {x} with floor(x) = {n}")
            return x

solution = find_x()
```

The program checks integer floor values from 1 upwards, calculates x = 17/n for each, and verifies if it satisfies the floor condition. It stops at the first valid solution, which must be unique by the problem statement. The solution is printed immediately when found.
