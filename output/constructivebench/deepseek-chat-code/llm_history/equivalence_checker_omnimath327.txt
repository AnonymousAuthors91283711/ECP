Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n - 3
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (n + 2) / 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal number of vertices in a graph of size n=1982 where every 4-vertex subset contains a vertex connected to all others in that subset.

2. The ground truth answer suggests that for any n, the minimal number is n-3.

3. The proposed answer gives a completely different formula: (n+2)/2.

For n=1982:
- Ground truth: 1982-3 = 1979
- Proposed: (1982+2)/2 = 992

These are clearly very different results (1979 vs 992). The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth, and the difference is too large to be a domain/constraint issue.
