noncomputable abbrev omnimath3189_answer : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3189 (L P M : ℝ) :
  (∃ N, M = L + (1/3) * (P - L) ∧ N = L + (2/3) * (P - L) ∧ 
   M - L = N - M ∧ N - M = P - N) ↔ M = omnimath3189_answer L P := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun L P => L + (1/3) * (P - L)
Proposed Answer: fun L P => L + (1/3) * (P - L)
<<<True>>>
