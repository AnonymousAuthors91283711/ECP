This problem asks for the natural number `n` such that `10^n = 1000^20`. We'll solve it by simplifying both sides to the same base and comparing exponents.

The key observation is that 1000 can be written as 10^3, so:
1000^20 = (10^3)^20 = 10^(3*20) = 10^60

Therefore, the equation becomes:
10^n = 10^60

Since the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal:
n = 60

Here's a Python program that verifies this by direct computation:

```python
# Verify that 10^60 equals 1000^20 by computing both sides
n = 60
left = 10 ** n
right = 1000 ** 20
print(f"10^{n} = {left}")
print(f"1000^20 = {right}")
print(f"Are they equal? {left == right}")
```

The output will show that both expressions evaluate to the same value (1 followed by 60 zeros), confirming that n=60 is indeed the correct answer.
