This problem asks for the minimal number of elements `n` such that there exists a collection of 8 subsets (each of size 6) where:
1. Any two distinct subsets are disjoint
2. For any two distinct pairs of subsets, their intersections cannot both be non-empty

We'll approach this by enumerating possible values of `n` and checking if such a configuration exists. The key is to model the constraints combinatorially.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_valid_configuration(subsets):
    # Check all pairs are disjoint
    for s1, s2 in combinations(subsets, 2):
        if s1 & s2:
            return False
    
    # Check intersection condition for all pairs of pairs
    all_pairs = list(combinations(subsets, 2))
    for (a,b), (c,d) in combinations(all_pairs, 2):
        if (a & b) and (c & d):
            return False
    return True

def generate_subsets(n, k=6, m=8):
    # Try to find m subsets of size k in [0..n-1] satisfying conditions
    from itertools import combinations
    universe = set(range(n))
    
    # We'll greedily try to find disjoint subsets first
    subsets = []
    remaining = universe.copy()
    
    for _ in range(m):
        if len(remaining) < k:
            return None
        s = set(combinations(remaining, k).__next__())
        subsets.append(s)
        remaining -= s
    
    if is_valid_configuration(subsets):
        return subsets
    return None

def find_min_n():
    # Start from theoretical lower bound: m*k - (m choose 2) since intersections must be unique
    # For m=8, k=6: 8*6 - 28 = 20
    for n in range(20, 50):
        print(f"Testing n = {n}")
        result = generate_subsets(n)
        if result is not None:
            print(f"Found valid configuration for n = {n}:")
            for s in result:
                print(sorted(s))
            print()
            return n
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    min_n = find_min_n()
    if min_n is not None:
        print(f"Minimum n found: {min_n}")
    else:
        print("No solution found in tested range")
```

Note: This implementation uses a greedy approach which may not find valid configurations even if they exist. A complete solution would require a more sophisticated search algorithm, but this gives a starting point for enumeration. The theoretical lower bound suggests n â‰¥ 20, so we start searching there. The actual minimal n might be higher due to the additional intersection constraints.
