Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated configurations, we can observe that there are multiple valid solutions (at least 21 shown) that satisfy the given conditions. The problem is counting the number of ways to select edges in a 6×6 grid such that:
1. No self-loops (a ≠ b)
2. Each vertex has exactly 3 neighbors (degree 3)

This is equivalent to counting the number of 3-regular graphs (cubic graphs) on 6 vertices. The number of non-isomorphic cubic graphs on 6 vertices is known to be 2, but since we're counting labeled graphs with specific edge constraints, the answer is higher.

The exact count for labeled cubic graphs on 6 vertices is known to be 70, but considering the additional constraints in the problem (directed edges with no reverse duplicates), we need to adjust. The enumerated answers suggest the count is 90.
