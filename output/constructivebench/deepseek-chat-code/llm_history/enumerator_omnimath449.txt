This problem involves evaluating an infinite series. To approach it computationally, we'll:
1. Compute partial sums of the series to observe convergence
2. Compare with known constants to identify the exact value
3. Output partial sums and their differences from candidate values

The series terms simplify to a rational expression, so we'll compute exact fractions when possible.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
import math

def term(n):
    # Compute the term as exact fraction: 1/((2n+3)^2 - (2n+1)^2) * (1/(2n+1)^2 - 1/(2n+3)^2)
    a = 2*n + 1
    b = 2*n + 3
    denominator_diff = b*b - a*a
    term_part = Fraction(1, a*a) - Fraction(1, b*b)
    return Fraction(1, denominator_diff) * term_part

def partial_sum(N):
    total = Fraction(0, 1)
    for n in range(N+1):
        total += term(n)
        # Print every 100 terms to show progress
        if n % 100 == 0:
            float_val = float(total)
            print(f"After {n} terms: {float_val:.15f}")
            # Compare with π²/32 ≈ 0.3084251375
            pi_sq_32 = math.pi**2 / 32
            diff = abs(float_val - pi_sq_32)
            print(f"  Difference from π²/32: {diff:.15f}")
    return total

# Compute up to 1000 terms (should show clear convergence)
N = 1000
final_sum = partial_sum(N)
print("\nFinal partial sum (as float):", float(final_sum))
print("π²/32:", math.pi**2 / 32)
```
