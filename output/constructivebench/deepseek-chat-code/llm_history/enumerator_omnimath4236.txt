This problem involves finding the maximum number of teams (n) that can be arranged in a tournament with c cities (where c â‰¥ 4 is even) under certain constraints about home/away assignments. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible n values for small even c values.

The constraints are:
1. Each team has a home city pair and an away city
2. Away city must not be in home pair
3. Different teams sharing same home pair must have different away cities
4. No two teams can have each other's away city in their home pair

We'll model this as a graph problem where we try to maximize the number of edges (teams) under these constraints.

```python
from itertools import combinations, product

def max_teams(c):
    cities = list(range(c))
    max_n = 0
    
    # Generate all possible home pairs (undirected)
    home_pairs = list(combinations(cities, 2))
    
    # Try increasing n values until no solution exists
    for n in range(1, 2*c):  # Reasonable upper bound
        found = False
        
        # Try all possible combinations of n home pairs (with possible repeats)
        for selected_homes in product(home_pairs, repeat=n):
            away_assignments = []
            valid = True
            
            # Check constraints for each team
            for i in range(n):
                home = selected_homes[i]
                # Constraint 1: away not in home
                possible_aways = [city for city in cities if city not in home]
                
                # Constraint 2: same home pairs must have different aways
                same_home_indices = [j for j in range(i) if selected_homes[j] == home]
                forbidden_aways = [away_assignments[j] for j in same_home_indices]
                possible_aways = [a for a in possible_aways if a not in forbidden_aways]
                
                if not possible_aways:
                    valid = False
                    break
                
                # For now pick first available away city (we'll check constraint 3 later)
                away = possible_aways[0]
                away_assignments.append(away)
            
            if not valid:
                continue
                
            # Now check constraint 3: no mutual containment
            mutual_ok = True
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(i+1, n):
                    home_i = set(selected_homes[i])
                    home_j = set(selected_homes[j])
                    if away_assignments[i] in home_j and away_assignments[j] in home_i:
                        mutual_ok = False
                        break
                if not mutual_ok:
                    break
            
            if mutual_ok:
                found = True
                break
        
        if found:
            max_n = n
        else:
            break
    
    return max_n

# Test for small even c values
for c in [4, 6, 8]:
    print(f"c={c}, max_n={max_teams(c)}")
```

The program tests small even values of c (4, 6, 8) and finds the maximum n that satisfies all constraints. For each c, it tries increasing n values until no valid configuration exists. The output shows the maximum n found for each c. The pattern suggests the general solution might be n = c-1, but we let the program discover this through enumeration.
