[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of linear equations with integers. We'll write a Python program to find all integer solutions (a, b, c) that satisfy the given equations:
1. a + 5 = b
2. 5 + b = c
3. b + c = a

The program will iterate through possible integer values for b and check if they satisfy all equations. Since the equations are linear, we can expect either no solution, one solution, or infinitely many solutions.

```python
def find_solutions():
    # We'll search for b in a reasonable range around 0
    for b in range(-100, 101):
        a = b - 5  # from a + 5 = b
        c = 5 + b   # from 5 + b = c
        # Check if b + c = a
        if b + c == a:
            print(f"Solution found: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
            return  # Since this is a linear system, there's at most one solution
    print("No solution found in the search range")

find_solutions()
```
