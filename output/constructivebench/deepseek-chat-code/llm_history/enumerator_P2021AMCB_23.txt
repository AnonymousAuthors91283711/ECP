This problem involves calculating the total probability of certain arithmetic triples (a,b,c) where they form an arithmetic progression with a < b < c, and each term is weighted by 2^{-a-b-c}. We'll enumerate small cases to identify the pattern.

```python
def prob(a, b, c):
    return (2 ** (-a)) * (2 ** (-b)) * (2 ** (-c))

def is_event(a, b, c):
    return a < b < c and (b - a) == (c - b) and a != b and b != c

def calculate_total_prob(max_n=20):
    total = 0.0
    for a in range(1, max_n):
        for b in range(a+1, max_n):
            for c in range(b+1, max_n):
                if is_event(a, b, c):
                    p = prob(a, b, c)
                    total += p
                    print(f"Found triple ({a},{b},{c}) with prob {p}")
    print(f"Total probability up to n={max_n}: {total}")
    return total

if __name__ == "__main__":
    calculate_total_prob()
```
