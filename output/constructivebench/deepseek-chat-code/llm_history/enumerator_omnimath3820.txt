This problem asks for the set of natural numbers N where there exists a range of 1000 consecutive numbers (starting from some k) where every number in that range has digit sum equal to N. We need to find all such possible N values.

The approach is to:
1. Iterate through possible N values
2. For each N, check if there exists a window of 1000 consecutive numbers where all have digit sum N
3. Since digit sums can't be too large for 4-digit numbers (max 9*4=36), we'll limit our search to reasonable N values

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

def check_window_exists(N):
    # Check if there's a window of 1000 numbers where all have digit sum N
    # Since digit sums are periodic mod 9, and we need 1000 consecutive numbers,
    # N must be congruent to 0 mod 9 (as it must cover all residues)
    if N % 9 != 0:
        return False
    
    # For numbers with 4 digits, max digit sum is 36 (9999)
    if N > 36:
        return False
    
    # Check possible windows by looking at numbers up to 10000
    for k in range(1, 10000):
        all_match = True
        for m in range(k, k + 1000):
            if digit_sum(m) != N:
                all_match = False
                break
        if all_match:
            return True
    return False

# Main execution
print("Possible N values where such a window exists:")
valid_N = []
for N in range(1, 37):
    if check_window_exists(N):
        valid_N.append(N)
        print(N)

print("Final answer set:", valid_N)
```
