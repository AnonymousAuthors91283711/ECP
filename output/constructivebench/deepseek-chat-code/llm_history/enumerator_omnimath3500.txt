The problem is about finding Janice's current age (Janice_now) such that her age in 12 years (Janice_12years) is 8 times her age 2 years ago (Janice_2yearsago). We need to enumerate possible ages and check this condition.

We'll:
1. Iterate through possible current ages (Janice_now)
2. Calculate Janice_2yearsago and Janice_12years for each
3. Check if Janice_12years == 8 * Janice_2yearsago
4. Print matching ages

```python
def solve():
    # Iterate possible current ages from 3 upwards (since 2 years ago must be positive)
    for janice_now in range(3, 100):
        janice_2yearsago = janice_now - 2
        janice_12years = janice_now + 12
        if janice_12years == 8 * janice_2yearsago:
            print(f"Found solution: Janice's current age is {janice_now}")
            print(f"  - 2 years ago: {janice_2yearsago}")
            print(f"  - in 12 years: {janice_12years}")
            print(f"  Verification: 8 * {janice_2yearsago} = {8 * janice_2yearsago} == {janice_12years}")
            return  # Stop after finding first solution since it's unique

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```
