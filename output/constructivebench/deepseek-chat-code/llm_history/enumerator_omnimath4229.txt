[write_program]
This problem involves finding real values of 'a' for which the given quartic equation has four distinct real roots in geometric progression. We'll write a Python program to search for such 'a' values by:
1. Parameterizing the roots as x, xr, xr², xr³
2. Using Vieta's formulas to derive conditions on 'a'
3. Solving the resulting equations numerically

```python
import numpy as np
from itertools import product

def find_a_candidates():
    # We'll search for r values in a reasonable range
    r_values = np.linspace(0.1, 3.0, 100)
    a_candidates = set()
    
    for r in r_values:
        if r == 1.0:  # Skip trivial case
            continue
            
        # Coefficients from Vieta's formulas for roots in GP
        # The quartic is 16(x-x1)(x-x2)(x-x3)(x-x4)
        # We compare coefficients with the given form
        r2 = r * r
        r3 = r2 * r
        r4 = r3 * r
        r5 = r4 * r
        r6 = r5 * r
        
        # Sum of roots (x1 coefficient)
        s1 = 1 + r + r2 + r3
        # Sum of product of roots two at a time
        s2 = r + r2 + r3 + r2 + r3 + r4
        # Sum of product of roots three at a time
        s3 = r3 + r4 + r5 + r4 + r5 + r6
        # Product of roots
        s4 = r6
        
        # From the quartic equation coefficients
        a_numerator = 16 * s1
        a_denominator = r + r2 + r3
        
        # Avoid division by zero
        if abs(a_denominator) < 1e-8:
            continue
            
        a = a_numerator / a_denominator
        
        # Check if this a gives four distinct real roots
        # We'll test a sample x value
        try:
            x = 1.0  # arbitrary choice since roots scale
            roots = [x, x*r, x*r*r, x*r*r*r]
            poly = [16, -a, 2*a+17, -a, 16]
            # Evaluate polynomial at roots
            valid = True
            for root in roots:
                val = sum(coef * (root**i) for i, coef in enumerate(reversed(poly)))
                if abs(val) > 1e-6:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                a_candidates.add(round(a, 6))
        except:
            continue
    
    return sorted(a_candidates)

# Find and print candidates
candidates = find_a_candidates()
print("Possible a values with four distinct real roots in GP:")
for a in candidates:
    print(a)
