Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | Even n ∧ n > 0}
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | Even n}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but incomplete. The ground truth specifies that n must be both even AND greater than 0, while the proposed answer only requires n to be even. The proposed answer would incorrectly include n=0, which shouldn't be in the solution set since the problem requires b > n (which would be b > 0 when n=0) and (b² - n²) > 0 (which would be b² > 0 when n=0), but doesn't guarantee solutions exist for n=0.
