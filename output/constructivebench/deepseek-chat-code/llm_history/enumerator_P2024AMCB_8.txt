This problem involves solving a logarithmic equation for positive real x. We'll enumerate possible solutions by testing rational numbers and simple expressions involving logarithms. The equation is:

log₂x * log₃x = 2(log₂x + log₃x)

We'll convert this to natural logarithms using the change of base formula and test values systematically.

```python
import math

def check_solution(x):
    if x <= 0:
        return False
    try:
        log2x = math.log2(x)
        log3x = math.log(x, 3)
        lhs = log2x * log3x
        rhs = 2 * (log2x + log3x)
        return math.isclose(lhs, rhs, rel_tol=1e-9)
    except ValueError:
        return False

# Test simple integer powers of 2 and 3 first
for a in range(-5, 6):
    for b in range(-5, 6):
        x = (2**a) * (3**b)
        if check_solution(x):
            print(f"Found solution: {x}")

# Test more general values in a reasonable range
for n in range(1, 1000):
    x = n / 100
    if check_solution(x):
        print(f"Found solution: {x}")

# Check special values like 1/36, 1/6, 6, 36, etc.
special_values = [1/36, 1/6, 1, 6, 36, 216]
for x in special_values:
    if check_solution(x):
        print(f"Found special solution: {x}")

# After enumeration, we can see the pattern and identify the exact solution
```
