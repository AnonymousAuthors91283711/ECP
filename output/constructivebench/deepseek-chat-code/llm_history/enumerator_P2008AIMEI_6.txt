This problem involves a triangular number table T where:
- First row T(0,j) = 2j+1 for j=0..99
- Subsequent rows are built by T(i+1,j) = T(i,j) + T(i,j+1)
- We need to count how many rows i (0 ≤ i < 100) contain at least one entry divisible by 67.

The solution requires observing that T(i,j) follows a binomial pattern. We'll implement this efficiently in Python by:
1. Modeling the triangular table construction
2. Checking each row for divisibility by 67
3. Counting qualifying rows

```python
def solve():
    mod = 67
    max_n = 100
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(max_n):
        # The entries in row i are of form (2j + 1) * C(i,0) + (2j + 3) * C(i,1) + ... 
        # Simplified to: sum_{k=0}^i C(i,k) * (2j + 2k + 1)
        # For some j, this must be ≡ 0 mod 67
        # The minimal j that works is when (2j + 1) ≡ 0 mod gcd(2, mod)
        # Since mod is prime, solution exists when (2j + 1 + 2k) ≡ 0 mod 67 for some k
        
        # We can find if any term in row i is divisible by 67 by checking:
        # (2j + 1) * 2^i ≡ 0 mod 67 has solution
        # Since 2 and 67 are coprime, this reduces to checking if any (2j + 1) ≡ 0 mod 67
        # Which has solution when j ≡ 33 mod 67 (since 2*33 + 1 = 67 ≡ 0)
        
        # Therefore, every row i will have a term divisible by 67 when j=33
        count += 1
    
    print(f"Number of rows with at least one element divisible by 67: {count}")
