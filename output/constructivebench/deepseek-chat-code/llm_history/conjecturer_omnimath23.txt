abbrev omnimath23_answer : Set (ℤ × ℤ → ℝ) := sorry
theorem omnimath23 (f : ℤ × ℤ → ℝ) :
  (∀ (x y : ℤ), f (x, y) ∈ Set.Icc 0 1 ∧ f (x, y) = (f (x - 1, y) + f (x, y - 1)) / 2) ↔ f ∈ omnimath23_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing constant functions:
Found solution: f(x,y) = 0
Found solution: f(x,y) = 0.5
Found solution: f(x,y) = 1

Testing linear functions:
Found solution: f(x,y) = 0x + 0y
Found solution: f(x,y) = 0.1x + -0.1y
Found solution: f(x,y) = -0.1x + 0.1y

Testing exponential solutions:
Found solution: f(x,y) = 1^(x+y)

Conclusion: Only constant functions satisfy all conditions. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ → ℝ)
<<<{f | ∃ c ∈ Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1, ∀ x y, f (x, y) = c}>>>
