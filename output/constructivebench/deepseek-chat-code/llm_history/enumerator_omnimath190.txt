This problem asks for the smallest 10th element (a10) in an 11-element set A of natural numbers, where:
1. A is strictly increasing (StrictMonoOn)
2. Every number from 1 to 1500 can be expressed as a sum of some subset of A
3. We need to find the minimal possible a10 in such sets

We'll approach this by:
1. Generating candidate sets with increasing a10 values
2. Checking if they can represent all numbers 1-1500
3. Finding the minimal a10 where such a set exists

```python
def is_valid_set(A):
    max_needed = 1500
    achievable = set()
    achievable.add(0)
    for num in A:
        new_sums = set()
        for s in achievable:
            new_sum = s + num
            if new_sum <= max_needed:
                new_sums.add(new_sum)
        achievable.update(new_sums)
    return all(n in achievable for n in range(1, max_needed + 1))

def find_min_a10():
    # We know the first 9 elements must be 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256 (powers of 2)
    # to cover sums up to 511 (2^9-1)
    base = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256]
    
    # The 10th element (a10) must be <= 1500 - sum(base) = 1500 - 511 = 989
    max_a10 = 989
    
    # The 11th element must be large enough to cover up to 1500
    # We'll try a10 values in increasing order
    for a10 in range(257, max_a10 + 1):
        # The 11th element must be at least 1500 - (sum(base) + a10)
        min_a11 = 1500 - (511 + a10)
        if min_a11 < a10:
            continue  # Would violate strict ordering
            
        # Try the minimal possible a11
        a11 = min_a11
        A = base + [a10, a11]
        if is_valid_set(A):
            print(f"Found valid set with a10 = {a10}: {A}")
            return a10
    
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = find_min_a10()
    if result is not None:
        print(f"Minimal a10 found: {result}")
    else:
        print("No valid set found")
```
