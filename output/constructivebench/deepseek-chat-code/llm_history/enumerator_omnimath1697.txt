The problem asks for the cardinality of the set of all functions from `Fin 4` (a finite type with 4 elements) to `Bool` (which has 2 elements). This is equivalent to counting all possible binary sequences of length 4, which is 2^4 = 16.

Here's a Python program that enumerates all possible functions from a 4-element set to {False, True} and counts them:

```python
from itertools import product

def main():
    # The domain is a 4-element set (Fin 4), represented as [0,1,2,3]
    # The codomain is Bool (False, True)
    # Each function can be represented as a 4-tuple of Booleans
    
    count = 0
    for f in product([False, True], repeat=4):
        print(f)  # Print each function as it's generated
        count += 1
    
    print(f"Total number of functions: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program outputs all 16 possible functions (as tuples of 4 Booleans) and then prints the total count. The output will show:
1. All 16 possible combinations of True/False for 4 positions
2. The final count of 16, which is the answer to the problem (2^4)
