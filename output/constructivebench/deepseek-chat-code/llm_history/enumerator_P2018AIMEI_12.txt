This problem is about counting subsets of {1,2,...,18} whose sum is divisible by 3. The total number of subsets is 2^18. We need to find how many subsets have sum divisible by 3, and express the answer in reduced form.

Here's a Python program that enumerates all subsets of {1,2,...,18} and counts those with sum divisible by 3. Since enumerating all 2^18 subsets is computationally intensive, we'll use dynamic programming for efficiency.

```python
def count_subsets():
    n = 18
    # DP table: dp[i][j] = number of subsets of first i numbers with sum â‰¡ j mod 3
    dp = [[0]*3 for _ in range(n+1)]
    dp[0][0] = 1  # empty set
    
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(3):
            # Either include or exclude the current number
            rem = (j - i) % 3
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][rem]
    
    good = dp[n][0]
    total = 2**n
    # Reduce fraction
    gcd = lambda a, b: a if b == 0 else gcd(b, a % b)
    d = gcd(good, total)
    print(f"Good subsets: {good}/{total}")
    print(f"Reduced form: {good//d}/{total//d}")

count_subsets()
```
