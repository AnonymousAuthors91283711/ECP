[write_program]
This problem involves finding the maximum number m of pairs (B_i, C_i) where:
- Each B_i is a k-element subset of an n-element set
- Each C_i is a subset of B_i
- For any two distinct pairs i≠j, the intersections B_i∩C_j and B_j∩C_i must be different

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible m values for small n and k, looking for patterns.

```python
from itertools import combinations, product

def max_m(n, k):
    universe = set(range(n))
    max_found = 0
    
    # Iterate over possible m values
    for m in range(1, 2**n + 1):
        found = False
        
        # Generate all possible B sets (k-element subsets)
        for B_sets in combinations(combinations(range(n), k), m):
            B_sets = [set(b) for b in B_sets]
            
            # For each B_i, generate possible C_i subsets
            all_C = []
            for B in B_sets:
                # Generate all subsets of B
                subsets = []
                for r in range(len(B)+1):
                    subsets.extend(combinations(B, r))
                all_C.append([set(c) for c in subsets])
            
            # Check all possible combinations of C_i
            for C_choices in product(*all_C):
                valid = True
                # Check all pairs i≠j
                for i in range(m):
                    for j in range(i+1, m):
                        inter1 = B_sets[i] & C_choices[j]
                        inter2 = B_sets[j] & C_choices[i]
                        if inter1 == inter2:
                            valid = False
                            break
                    if not valid:
                        break
                
                if valid:
                    max_found = max(max_found, m)
                    found = True
                    break
            
            if found:
                break
        
        if not found:
            break
    
    return max_found

# Test small cases
for n in range(1, 6):
    for k in range(1, n):
        print(f"n={n}, k={k}: max m found = {max_m(n, k)}")
```

Note: This program is computationally intensive for larger n and k due to combinatorial explosion. For practical use, we would need to optimize or find mathematical patterns rather than brute-forcing all combinations. The current implementation serves as a starting point for small cases.
