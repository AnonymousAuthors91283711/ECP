Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Looking at the enumerated answers, we observe the pattern t ≈ (1 + x)/x where x is small. The minimal t occurs when x approaches 0, making t approach infinity. However, the problem asks for the greatest lower bound (infimum) of this set. From the pattern, as x→0+, t = y/x → 1/x (since y≈1). The infimum would be the limit of this expression as x→0+, which is +∞. However, since the problem asks for IsLeast (minimum), and the set is unbounded below, we need to find the actual minimum. The minimal t occurs when the constraint |z²+2| ≤ |z| is tightest, which happens when z = i (x=0, y=1), giving t = y/x → ∞. But since x can't be 0, the infimum is 1 (from y/x when y≈x).
