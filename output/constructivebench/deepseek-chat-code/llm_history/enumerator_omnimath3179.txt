The problem involves finding all odd integers k in the range 1 to 99 such that there are exactly two pairs (m,n) of positive integers (m,n ≤ 100) satisfying the equation:

2^(4*m^2) + 2^(m^2 - n^2 + 4) = 2^(k+4) + 2^(3*m^2 + n^2 + k)

We need to enumerate possible k values and count how many valid (m,n) pairs exist for each k, then identify those k where this count is exactly 2.

Here's a Python program to solve this:

```python
def solve():
    max_k = 99
    max_mn = 100
    results = []
    
    for k in range(1, max_k + 1, 2):  # Only odd k
        count = 0
        for m in range(1, max_mn + 1):
            for n in range(1, max_mn + 1):
                lhs = 2**(4*m*m) + 2**(m*m - n*n + 4)
                rhs = 2**(k+4) + 2**(3*m*m + n*n + k)
                if lhs == rhs:
                    count += 1
                    if count > 2:  # Early exit if exceeds 2
                        break
            if count > 2:
                break
        if count == 2:
            results.append(k)
            print(f"Found k = {k} with exactly 2 solutions")
    
    print("\nFinal odd k values with exactly 2 solutions:", results)

solve()
```

The program:
1. Iterates through odd k values from 1 to 99
2. For each k, checks all (m,n) pairs up to 100
3. Counts how many pairs satisfy the equation
4. Prints k values that have exactly 2 solutions
5. Finally prints all qualifying k values

The program includes early termination when count exceeds 2 for efficiency. The output shows intermediate results as they're found and the final collection of valid k values.

Let me analyze this problem and the provided program:

Judgement:
1. The problem asks to find all odd integers k (1 ≤ k ≤ 99) where there are exactly 2 pairs (m,n) with m,n > 0 that satisfy the given equation.
2. The program correctly:
   - Only checks odd k values
   - Uses reasonable bounds (100) for m and n
   - Implements early termination when count exceeds 2
   - Prints results as they're found
3. However, the program outputs an empty result, which suggests either:
   - No solutions exist (unlikely for a competition problem)
   - The bounds are too small
   - There's a bug in the equation implementation

After careful examination:
- The equation implementation appears correct
- The bounds might be too small - m=100 gives 2^(40000) which is enormous
- The problem likely expects us to find algebraic simplifications first

The program is correctly implemented but fails to find solutions due to computational limitations. We should modify it to:
1. First simplify the equation algebraically to find constraints on m,n,k
2. Use smaller bounds based on the simplified form
3. Still maintain the streaming output requirement

                # And 3m²+n²+k must match the other exponent

                rhs_exp2 = 3*m*m + n*n + k

Judgement Explanation:
The problem involves finding natural numbers k (1 ≤ k < 100) that are odd and satisfy a specific equation condition involving exponents with variables m and n (0 < m,n < 100). The condition requires exactly 2 pairs (m,n) to satisfy the equation for each valid k. Since no program was provided, we need to create one from scratch.

The original submission is empty, so it must be rejected. We'll create a Python program that:
1. Iterates through possible k values (1-99, odd only)
2. For each k, checks all (m,n) pairs in (1-99)×(1-99)
3. Counts how many pairs satisfy the equation
4. Outputs k values that have exactly 2 satisfying pairs
5. Finally outputs the count of such k values

The equation can be simplified by dividing both sides by 2^4 to reduce computation size.

```python
def solve():
    count_valid_k = 0
    for k in range(1, 100, 2):  # only odd k
        valid_pairs = 0
        for m in range(1, 100):
            for n in range(1, 100):
                # Simplified equation after dividing both sides by 2^4
                lhs = 2**(4*m*m - 4) + 2**(m*m - n*n)
                rhs = 2**k + 2**(3*m*m + n*n + k - 4)
                if lhs == rhs:
                    valid_pairs += 1
                    if valid_pairs > 2:
                        break
            if valid_pairs > 2:
                break
        if valid_pairs == 2:
            print(f"Found valid k: {k}")
            count_valid_k += 1
    print(f"Total count of valid k values: {count_valid_k}")
