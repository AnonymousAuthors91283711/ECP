The problem asks to find all integer solutions to the inequality (x² - 3)(x² + 5) < 0. We need to enumerate integer values of x that satisfy this condition. The approach is to analyze the inequality and test integer values within a reasonable range.

Since x² + 5 is always positive (minimum value is 5 when x=0), the inequality reduces to x² - 3 < 0, because positive × negative = negative. So we're looking for x where x² < 3. We'll test integers around this range.

```python
def solve_inequality():
    # We'll check integers from -2 to 2 since sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732
    for x in range(-2, 3):
        if (x**2 - 3) * (x**2 + 5) < 0:
            print(x)

    # Also check negative values symmetrically
    for x in range(1, 3):
        if ((-x)**2 - 3) * ((-x)**2 + 5) < 0:
            print(-x)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_inequality()
```
