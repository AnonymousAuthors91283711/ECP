theorem omnimath2350 :

Ground Truth Answer: 20481 / 4096
Proposed Answer: 11/2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about calculating the average number of bit transitions in binary representations of numbers from 0 to 4095 (since 4096 is excluded in Finset.range 4096).

2. The ground truth answer is 20481/4096, which is approximately 5.000244.

3. The proposed answer is 11/2, which is exactly 5.5.

4. The correct average number of bit transitions should be slightly more than 5 because:
   - 4096 is 2^12, so we're dealing with 12-bit numbers
   - The expected number of transitions is (n-1)/2 where n is number of bits
   - For 12 bits: (12-1)/2 = 5.5 transitions on average
   - However, this is only exact for all possible bit strings, but our range includes numbers from 0 to 4095 which have leading zeros when represented as 12-bit numbers
   - The ground truth seems to account for these leading zeros

The proposed answer (11/2) is actually the correct theoretical expectation for random bit strings of length 12, while the ground truth (20481/4096) appears to be accounting for the specific distribution of numbers from 0 to 4095.
