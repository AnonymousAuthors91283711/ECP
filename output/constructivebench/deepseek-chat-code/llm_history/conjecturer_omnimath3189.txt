noncomputable abbrev omnimath3189_answer : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3189 (L P M : ℝ) :
  (∃ N, M = L + (1/3) * (P - L) ∧ N = L + (2/3) * (P - L) ∧ 
   M - L = N - M ∧ N - M = P - N) ↔ M = omnimath3189_answer L P := by sorry. Enumerated answers: For L=0, P=3: M=1.00 satisfies all conditions
For L=1, P=4: M=2.00 satisfies all conditions
For L=2, P=5: M=3.00 satisfies all conditions
For L=3, P=6: M=4.00 satisfies all conditions
For L=4, P=7: M=5.00 satisfies all conditions. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
