This problem asks for the largest two-digit number (n) where reversing its digits (b*10 + a) equals 7/4 times the original number (10*a + b). We'll enumerate all two-digit numbers (10-99) and check this condition.

```python
def main():
    for n in range(99, 9, -1):  # Check from largest to smallest
        a = n // 10
        b = n % 10
        reversed_num = 10 * b + a
        if 4 * reversed_num == 7 * n:  # Cross-multiply to avoid floating point
            print(n)
            break  # Since we're checking from largest, first found is greatest

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
