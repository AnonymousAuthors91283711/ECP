Ground Truth Answer: 1209
Proposed Answer: 23 * 43
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer "23 * 43" is equivalent to the ground truth answer "1209" because 23 multiplied by 43 indeed equals 1209. The problem statement itself confirms this equivalence in the theorem's conclusion where it states "23 * 43 = omnimath1548_answer" and provides 1209 as the ground truth value for omnimath1548_answer. Therefore, the two answers are mathematically identical.
