[write_program]
This problem involves finding the sum of the series `1/(n^2 + 2n)` for `n` from 1 to infinity. We'll write a Python program to compute partial sums and observe their convergence to help conjecture the exact value.

The approach is:
1. Compute partial sums up to a reasonable threshold (N=100000)
2. Print partial sums at logarithmic intervals to observe convergence
3. Compare with potential exact forms (like rational numbers or simple fractions)

```python
def compute_partial_sums(max_n=100000):
    partial_sum = 0.0
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        term = 1.0 / (n**2 + 2*n)
        partial_sum += term
        # Print at logarithmic intervals
        if n in {1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000}:
            print(f"S_{n} = {partial_sum:.15f}")
    return partial_sum

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Partial sums of the series 1/(n^2 + 2n):")
    final_sum = compute_partial_sums()
    print("\nObserved convergence suggests the sum approaches 0.75")
    print("This matches the exact value 3/4, which can be proven via telescoping series.")
```
