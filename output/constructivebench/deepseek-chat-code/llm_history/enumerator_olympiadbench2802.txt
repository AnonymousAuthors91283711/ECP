This problem involves calculating the area of a set S defined by two conditions in ℝ²: points outside a circle (x² + y² ≥ T) but inside a diamond (|x| + |y| ≤ √(2T)). For T=256, we'll compute this area numerically.

The approach is:
1. Parameterize the diamond boundary |x| + |y| = √512
2. Find intersection points between circle and diamond
3. Calculate area between these curves in one quadrant and multiply by 4

```python
import math

def calculate_area(T):
    sqrt_2T = math.sqrt(2 * T)
    # Intersection point between circle and diamond in first quadrant
    # Solve x + y = sqrt(2T) and x² + y² = T
    # Substitute y = sqrt(2T) - x
    # x² + (sqrt(2T)-x)² = T => 2x² - 2sqrt(2T)x + 2T = T
    # 2x² - 2sqrt(2T)x + T = 0
    discriminant = (2 * math.sqrt(2 * T))**2 - 4 * 2 * T
    x_intersect = (2 * math.sqrt(2 * T) - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 4
    
    # Area in first quadrant is diamond area minus circle area
    diamond_area = 0.5 * sqrt_2T * sqrt_2T  # Area under x + y = sqrt(2T)
    circle_area = (math.pi * T / 4) - (x_intersect * math.sqrt(T - x_intersect**2) + T * math.asin(x_intersect / math.sqrt(T)))
    
    area_one_quadrant = diamond_area - circle_area
    total_area = 4 * area_one_quadrant
    return total_area

T = 256
print(f"For T={T}, area is approximately {calculate_area(T)}")
print(f"Exact form would involve π terms and arcsin of {math.sqrt(2)/2}")
```
