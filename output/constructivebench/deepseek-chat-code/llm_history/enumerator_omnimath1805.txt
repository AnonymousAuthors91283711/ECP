[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of natural numbers k that are perfect squares and divide 10^10. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such numbers by:
1. Finding all divisors of 10^10
2. Checking which divisors are perfect squares
3. Counting them

The program will:
- Compute 10^10
- Generate all divisors of 10^10
- Check each divisor if it's a perfect square
- Count and print the valid numbers

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    root = math.isqrt(n)
    return root * root == n

def get_divisors(n):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, math.isqrt(n) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(n // i)
    return sorted(divisors)

def main():
    n = 10**10
    divisors = get_divisors(n)
    count = 0
    
    for k in divisors:
        if is_perfect_square(k):
            count += 1
            print(k)  # Print each valid k
    
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
