The problem asks for the infimum of the function `sqrt(58 - 42x) + sqrt(149 - 140*sqrt(1 - x^2))` for `x` in the interval `[-1, 1]`. To find this, we'll evaluate the function at various points in the interval and track the minimum value found.

We'll sample points in the interval `[-1, 1]` with small steps, compute the function value at each point, and keep track of the minimum. We'll also check boundary points and points where the derivative might be zero (though we won't compute derivatives here).

```python
import math

def f(x):
    term1 = math.sqrt(58 - 42 * x)
    sqrt_part = math.sqrt(1 - x**2)
    term2 = math.sqrt(149 - 140 * sqrt_part)
    return term1 + term2

# Sample points in [-1, 1] with step 0.001
min_value = float('inf')
min_x = -1
step = 0.001

x = -1
while x <= 1:
    try:
        current = f(x)
        if current < min_value:
            min_value = current
            min_x = x
            print(f"New minimum: f({x:.3f}) = {current:.6f}")
    except ValueError:  # handle cases where sqrt would be negative
        pass
    x += step

# Check boundary points more precisely
for x in [-1, 0, 1]:
    current = f(x)
    if current < min_value:
        min_value = current
        min_x = x
        print(f"New minimum at boundary: f({x}) = {current:.6f}")

print(f"\nFinal minimum value found: {min_value:.6f} at x = {min_x:.3f}")
```
