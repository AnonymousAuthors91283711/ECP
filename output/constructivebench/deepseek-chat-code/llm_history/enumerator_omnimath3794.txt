[write_program]
The problem asks to find all quadruples (a, b, c, p) where a, b, c are positive integers, p is a prime number, and they satisfy the equation: 73*p² + 6 = 9*a² + 17*b² + 17*c².

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Iterate through small prime numbers p
2. For each p, compute the left-hand side (73*p² + 6)
3. Find all possible combinations of (a, b, c) that satisfy the equation
4. Output valid solutions as they're found

We'll limit the search to reasonable bounds for efficiency.
