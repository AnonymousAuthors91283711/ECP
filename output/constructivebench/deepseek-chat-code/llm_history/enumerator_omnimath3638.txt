[write_program]
This problem involves summing a series of numbers where each term is a repunit (numbers like 1, 11, 111, etc.) up to n digits. The goal is to find a closed-form expression for this sum. We'll write a Python program to compute the sum for small values of n and look for patterns.

The program will:
1. Compute the sum for n from 0 to a reasonable limit (say 10)
2. Print each sum in exact rational form
3. Try to identify patterns in the numerators and denominators

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def repunit(k):
    """Returns the k-digit repunit number (1, 11, 111, etc.) as a Fraction"""
    if k == 0:
        return Fraction(0)
    return Fraction(10**k - 1, 9)

def compute_sum(n):
    """Computes the sum of repunits from 0 to n digits"""
    return sum(repunit(k) for k in range(n + 1))

# Compute and print sums for n from 0 to 10
for n in range(11):
    s = compute_sum(n)
    print(f"n={n}: sum = {s} (exact {s.numerator}/{s.denominator})")
```
