This problem involves finding x+y given two positive real numbers x and y satisfying x² + y² = 1 and (3x - 4x³)(3y - 4y³) = -1/2. We'll approach this by:

1. Using trigonometric substitution since x² + y² = 1 suggests x = cosθ, y = sinθ
2. Simplifying the product condition using triple angle identities
3. Enumerating possible angles to find solutions

```python
import math

def enumerate_solutions():
    # We'll search for θ in [0, π/2] since x,y > 0
    steps = 10000
    min_diff = float('inf')
    best_sum = None
    
    for i in range(steps + 1):
        theta = i * math.pi / (2 * steps)
        x = math.cos(theta)
        y = math.sin(theta)
        
        # Compute (3x - 4x^3)(3y - 4y^3)
        term1 = 3*x - 4*x**3
        term2 = 3*y - 4*y**3
        product = term1 * term2
        
        # Target is -0.5
        diff = abs(product - (-0.5))
        
        # Print close matches
        if diff < 0.01:
            print(f"θ: {theta:.4f} rad, x+y: {x+y:.6f}, product: {product:.6f}")
            
        # Track best solution
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            best_sum = x + y
    
    print(f"\nBest solution found: x + y ≈ {best_sum:.6f}")

enumerate_solutions()
```
