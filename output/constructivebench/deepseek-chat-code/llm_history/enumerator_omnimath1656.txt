This problem involves calculating the probability that two randomly drawn balls from a set of 5 blue and 5 red balls are of the same color. The formula given in the theorem calculates this probability by considering all possible pairs of same-color balls divided by all possible pairs.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Calculate the exact probability using the given formula
2. Verify it by enumerating all possible pairs (brute-force)
3. Output both the exact fraction and decimal approximation

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from itertools import combinations

def main():
    blue = 5
    red = 5
    total = blue + red
    
    # Calculate using the formula
    favorable = 2 * (blue * (blue - 1) + red * (red - 1))
    possible = total * (total - 1)
    exact_prob = Fraction(favorable, possible)
    
    print(f"Exact probability (formula): {exact_prob} ≈ {float(exact_prob):.4f}")
    
    # Verify by enumeration
    balls = ['B'] * blue + ['R'] * red
    same_color_pairs = 0
    total_pairs = 0
    
    for pair in combinations(balls, 2):
        total_pairs += 1
        if pair[0] == pair[1]:
            same_color_pairs += 1
    
    enumerated_prob = Fraction(same_color_pairs, total_pairs)
    print(f"Enumerated probability: {enumerated_prob} ≈ {float(enumerated_prob):.4f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
