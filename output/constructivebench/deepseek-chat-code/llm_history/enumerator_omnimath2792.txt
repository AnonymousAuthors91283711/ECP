This problem is a simple equation verification where we need to compute the sum of powers of 2. The Python program will calculate and print the exact value of the expression 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1.

```python
# Calculate and print the exact value of 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1
result = (2 ** 3) + (2 ** 2) + (2 ** 1)
print(result)
```
