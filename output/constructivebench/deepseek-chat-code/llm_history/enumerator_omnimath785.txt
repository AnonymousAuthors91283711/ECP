[write_program]
This problem defines a recursive sequence s(n) with specific base cases and recurrence relations. We need to compute s(1000) by implementing the recurrence rules in Python. The recurrence has three cases based on the input value's modulo 4 behavior.

The Python program will:
1. Implement memoization to store computed values
2. Handle the three recurrence cases (even, 4n+1, 4n-1)
3. Compute s(n) up to n=1000 using exact integer arithmetic
4. Print intermediate values to observe patterns

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def s(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    if n % 2 == 0:  # 2*n case
        return s(n // 2)
    if n % 4 == 1:  # 4*n+1 case
        return s((n - 1) // 2)
    if n % 4 == 3:  # 4*n-1 case
        m = (n + 1) // 4
        term = s(2*m - 1)
        return term + (term ** 2) // s(m - 1)

# Print s(n) for n up to 1000 to observe patterns
for n in range(1001):
    print(f"s({n}) = {s(n)}")

# The final answer will be printed when n=1000 is reached
```
