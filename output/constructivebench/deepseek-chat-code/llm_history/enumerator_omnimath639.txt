This problem involves finding the maximum value of the ratio of distances from a point on the unit circle to two fixed points in the complex plane: (√17, 0) and (0, √19). We'll approach this by:

1. Parameterizing points on the unit circle as z = e^(iθ)
2. Computing the distance ratio for each θ
3. Finding the maximum ratio

The program will:
- Sample θ values around the circle
- Compute the distance ratio for each θ
- Track the maximum ratio found
- Output intermediate results and the final maximum

```python
import math
import cmath

def distance_ratio(theta):
    """Compute the distance ratio for a given angle theta"""
    z = cmath.exp(1j * theta)
    numerator = abs(math.sqrt(17) - z)
    denominator = abs(1j * math.sqrt(19) - z)
    return numerator / denominator

def find_max_ratio():
    max_ratio = 0
    # Sample at fine enough intervals to catch the maximum
    for i in range(0, 6284):  # 6284 steps covers 2π with 0.001 precision
        theta = i * 0.001
        current_ratio = distance_ratio(theta)
        if current_ratio > max_ratio:
            max_ratio = current_ratio
            print(f"New max ratio: {max_ratio:.6f} at θ = {theta:.3f}")
    print(f"\nFinal maximum ratio: {max_ratio:.15f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_max_ratio()
```
