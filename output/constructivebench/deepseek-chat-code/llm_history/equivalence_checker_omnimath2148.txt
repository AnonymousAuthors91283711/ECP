Ground Truth Answer: 6156
Proposed Answer: 9216
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n > 0 such that the expression k = √(100 + √n) + √(100 - √n) yields an integer k.

The ground truth answer is 6156, while the proposed answer is 9216.

To verify, let's check both:

1. For n = 6156 (ground truth):
√6156 ≈ 78.460
√(100 + 78.460) ≈ √178.460 ≈ 13.359
√(100 - 78.460) ≈ √21.540 ≈ 4.641
Sum ≈ 13.359 + 4.641 ≈ 18 (integer)

2. For n = 9216 (proposed):
√9216 = 96 (exact)
√(100 + 96) = √196 = 14
√(100 - 96) = √4 = 2
Sum = 14 + 2 = 16 (integer)

While both values satisfy the condition, the problem asks for the smallest such n. Since 6156 < 9216, the ground truth answer is correct and the proposed answer, while satisfying the condition, is not the minimal solution.
