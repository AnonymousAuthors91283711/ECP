This problem involves finding the minimal exponent f' for the term (1-X^32)^f' in a product of terms (1-X^k)^e_k such that:
1. The coefficient of X^1 is -2
2. All coefficients from X^2 to X^32 are zero

We'll approach this by:
1. Modeling the polynomial product
2. Checking coefficients for different f' values
3. Finding the minimal f' satisfying the conditions

```python
from itertools import product
from math import comb
from collections import defaultdict

def main():
    max_f_prime = 10  # We'll search up to this value for f'
    max_k = 32        # Maximum exponent in the product
    
    # We need to find exponents where:
    # 1. sum_{k} e_k * k * x_k = 1 has solution sum x_k = -2 (for X^1 term)
    # 2. No solutions exist for sums equaling 2..32
    
    # Since all terms except (1-X)^a and (1-X^2)^b contribute minimally,
    # we can focus on these two terms first
    
    for f_prime in range(1, max_f_prime + 1):
        # Try combinations of a and b that give X^1 coefficient -2
        # The X^1 coefficient comes from: -a (from (1-X)^a) and -2b (from (1-X^2)^b)
        # So we need -a - 2b = -2 => a + 2b = 2
        
        possible_ab = []

            if a >= 0:

                # We need to consider all possible combinations of the terms
                # This is computationally intensive, so we'll make simplifying assumptions
                
                # The main contributions will come from (1-X)^a and (1-X^2)^b

                    remaining = n - 2*k
                    if remaining >= 0 and remaining <= a:
                        term = comb(b, k) * comb(a, remaining) * (-1)**k * (-1)**remaining
                        coeff += term
                
                # Other terms could contribute if their exponents divide n
                # But for minimal f', we assume other exponents are zero except f'
                if n % 32 == 0 and n//32 <= f_prime:
                    coeff += comb(f_prime, n//32) * (-1)**(n//32)
