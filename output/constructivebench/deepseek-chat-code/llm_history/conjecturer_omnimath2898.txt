theorem omnimath2898
: (4 ^ 2 = omnimath2898_answer ∨ 4 * 2 = omnimath2898_answer ∨ 4 - 2 = omnimath2898_answer ∨ 4 / 2 = omnimath2898_answer ∨ 4 + 2 = omnimath2898_answer) ∧ (∀ x : ℝ, (x = 4 ^ 2 ∨ x = 4 * 2 ∨ x = 4 - 2 ∨ x = 4 / 2 ∨ x = 4 + 2) → x ≤ omnimath2898_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 4^2 = 16
4*2 = 8
4-2 = 2
4/2 = 2.0
4+2 = 6

Maximum value is 16 from operation 4^2. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<16>>>
