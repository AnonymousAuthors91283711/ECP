Ground Truth Answer: { fun _ => 0, fun x => x + 1 }
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c d : ℤ, ∀ n : ℤ, f n = c * n + d}
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is about finding all integer-valued functions f: ℤ → ℤ that satisfy the functional equation:
∀ a b, f^[a² + b²] (a + b) = a * f(a) + b * f(b)

The ground truth gives two specific solutions:
1. The zero function (f(n) = 0)
2. The successor function (f(n) = n + 1)

The proposed answer suggests all affine functions (f(n) = c*n + d) satisfy the condition.

However, not all affine functions satisfy the original condition. For example:
- f(n) = 2n doesn't work (try a=1, b=0)
- f(n) = n (identity function) doesn't work (try a=1, b=1)

Only specific affine functions (f(n)=0 and f(n)=n+1) satisfy the condition. The proposed answer is too broad, including many functions that don't satisfy the original equation.
