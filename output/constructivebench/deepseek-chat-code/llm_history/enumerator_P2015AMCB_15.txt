This problem involves calculating the probability that the average of four test scores (two fixed at 4, and two variable from given distributions) is at least 7/2. We'll enumerate all possible combinations of English and History scores and compute their probabilities.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve():
    # English test: score probabilities
    english = [(4, Fraction(1,6)), (3, Fraction(1,4)), (2, Fraction(5,12))]
    # History test: score probabilities
    history = [(4, Fraction(1,4)), (3, Fraction(1,3)), (2, Fraction(5,12))]
    
    total_prob = Fraction(0, 1)
    
    for (e_score, e_prob) in english:
        for (h_score, h_prob) in history:
            # Calculate average of [4,4,e_score,h_score]
            average = (4 + 4 + e_score + h_score) / 4
            if average >= 3.5:  # 7/2 = 3.5
                prob = e_prob * h_prob
                total_prob += prob
                # Print each valid combination and its contribution
                print(f"English={e_score}, History={h_score}: {prob}")
    
    print(f"Total probability: {total_prob}")

solve()
```
