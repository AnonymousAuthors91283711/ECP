This problem involves finding the sticker price where the difference between two rebate options equals 15. We'll write a program to numerically search for the solution by testing possible sticker prices.

The equation given is:
rebate_B - rebate_A = 15
Where:
rebate_A = 0.85 * sticker_price - 90
rebate_B = 0.75 * sticker_price

Substituting these into the equation gives:
0.75p - (0.85p - 90) = 15
Which simplifies to:
-0.10p + 90 = 15
Then:
-0.10p = -75
Thus:
p = 750

We'll verify this numerically by testing values around 750 to confirm the solution.

```python
def find_sticker_price():
    # Test values around the expected solution
    for p in range(740, 761):
        rebate_A = 0.85 * p - 90
        rebate_B = 0.75 * p
        difference = rebate_B - rebate_A
        # Print candidate prices and their differences
        print(f"Price: {p}, Difference: {difference}")
        # Check if difference is approximately 15 (accounting for floating point)
        if abs(difference - 15) < 1e-6:
            print(f"\nExact solution found at price: {p}")
            return
    print("\nNo exact solution found in tested range")

find_sticker_price()
```
