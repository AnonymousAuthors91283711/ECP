Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 4, 6, 16)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 4, 6, 16), (2, 2, 5, 15), (2, 5, 5, 10)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all quadruples (a,b,c,d) where a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d and the set {ab+cd, ac+bd, ad+bc} equals {40, 70, 100}.

2. For the ground truth answer (1,4,6,16):
- ab+cd = 1*4 + 6*16 = 4 + 96 = 100
- ac+bd = 1*6 + 4*16 = 6 + 64 = 70
- ad+bc = 1*16 + 4*6 = 16 + 24 = 40
This satisfies the condition.

3. For proposed answer (2,2,5,15):
- ab+cd = 4 + 75 = 79 ≠ any in {40,70,100}
This doesn't satisfy the condition.

4. For proposed answer (2,5,5,10):
- ab+cd = 10 + 50 = 60 ≠ any in {40,70,100}
This doesn't satisfy the condition.

Only (1,4,6,16) satisfies the condition. The other two proposed solutions don't work.
