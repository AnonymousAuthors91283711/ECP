This problem involves solving for the average of two numbers a and b given a condition about their average with 5. The condition is (5 + a + b)/3 = 33, and we need to find (a + b)/2.

We can solve this algebraically:
1. From (5 + a + b)/3 = 33, multiply both sides by 3: 5 + a + b = 99
2. Subtract 5: a + b = 94
3. Divide by 2: (a + b)/2 = 47

Since this is a straightforward algebraic problem, we don't need enumeration. Here's a Python program that verifies the solution by plugging in sample values that satisfy the condition:

```python
def verify_solution():
    # Given condition: (5 + a + b)/3 = 33
    # We can choose any a and b that satisfy a + b = 94
    # Let's pick some sample pairs
    sample_pairs = [
        (0, 94),
        (47, 47),
        (10, 84),
        (-5, 99)
    ]
    
    for a, b in sample_pairs:
        avg_with_5 = (5 + a + b) / 3
        our_avg = (a + b) / 2
        print(f"For a={a}, b={b}:")
        print(f"  (5+a+b)/3 = {avg_with_5} (should be 33)")
        print(f"  (a+b)/2 = {our_avg}")
        print()

verify_solution()
```
