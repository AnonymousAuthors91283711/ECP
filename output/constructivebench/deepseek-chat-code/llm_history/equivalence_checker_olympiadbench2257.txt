Ground Truth Answer: fun (i, j) => 4 + 3 * (i - 1) + (3 + 4 * (i - 1)) * (j - 1)
Proposed Answer: fun ⟨i, j⟩ => 4 + 3 * (i - 1) + (3 + 4 * (i - 1)) * (j - 1)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. The only difference is in the syntax for pattern matching the input pair: the ground truth uses `(i, j)` while the proposed answer uses `⟨i, j⟩`. Both notations represent the same mathematical function and will produce identical results for all inputs. The angle bracket notation `⟨i, j⟩` is just Lean's alternative syntax for destructuring a pair.
