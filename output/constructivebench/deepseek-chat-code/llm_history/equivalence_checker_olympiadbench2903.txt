Ground Truth Answer: fun T => 1/9
Proposed Answer: fun T : ℕ => if T = 9 then 1 / 9 else 0
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is correct for the specific case when T=9 (as given in the theorem statement), but it incorrectly returns 0 for all other values of T. The ground truth answer suggests the ratio is always 1/9 regardless of T's value, which may or may not be the intended behavior (the problem statement only specifies the case when T=9). Since the problem only specifies the case T=9, the proposed answer is technically correct for the given constraints, but may not match the general behavior implied by the ground truth answer.
