This problem asks to find natural numbers x and y where x > y > 0, x + x*y = 391, and x + y is minimized (since it's the unique answer). We'll enumerate possible y values and compute corresponding x values to find all valid pairs.

```python
def find_solutions():
    # We'll iterate y from 1 upwards until x*y becomes too large
    solutions = []
    for y in range(1, 20):  # y can't be too large since x > y and x + x*y = 391
        # Solve x + x*y = 391 => x(1 + y) = 391 => x = 391/(1 + y)
        if 391 % (1 + y) == 0:
            x = 391 // (1 + y)
            if x > y and y > 0:
                solutions.append((x, y, x + y))
                print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}, x+y={x+y}")
    
    if solutions:
        min_sum = min(sol[2] for sol in solutions)
        print(f"\nMinimum x+y found: {min_sum}")
    else:
        print("No solutions found")

find_solutions()
```
