Ground Truth Answer: 8093
Proposed Answer: 2 * 2022 + 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the sum of all positive integers n where:
   - After exactly 2022 iterations of subtracting the smallest prime factor, n becomes prime
   - But after 2021 iterations, it's not yet prime

2. The ground truth answer is 8093, which suggests this is the sum of all such numbers that satisfy the condition.

3. The proposed answer is 2 * 2022 + 2 = 4046, which appears to be a formulaic guess rather than a calculated sum based on the actual condition.

4. There's no obvious mathematical relationship between 8093 and 4046 that would make them equivalent answers to this problem.

5. The proposed answer doesn't seem to account for the actual numbers that satisfy the iteration condition described in the problem.
