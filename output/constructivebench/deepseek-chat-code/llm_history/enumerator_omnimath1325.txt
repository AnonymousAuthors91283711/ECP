This problem asks for the smallest natural number n such that 2004 is in the set S(n), where S(n) is defined as all natural numbers ≥1 that are multiples of (n+1). In other words, we need to find the smallest n where (n+1) divides 2004.

The Python program will:
1. Find all divisors of 2004 (greater than 1, since n+1 ≥ 2)
2. For each divisor d, compute n = d-1
3. Find the smallest such n

```python
def find_min_n():
    target = 2004
    # Find all divisors of 2004 greater than 1
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(2, target + 1):
        if target % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
    
    # Compute corresponding n values (n = d-1)
    n_values = [d - 1 for d in sorted(divisors)]
    
    # Print all possible n values in order
    for n in sorted(n_values):
        print(f"Possible n: {n}")
    
    # The minimal n is the first one
    if n_values:
        print(f"Minimal n: {min(n_values)}")

find_min_n()
```
