<<< (7, 49) >>> 

Explanation: The problem involves finding real numbers a, b such that a non-real cube root of 343 (which is 7^3) satisfies a quadratic equation. The non-real cube roots of 343 are 7ω and 7ω² where ω = e^(2πi/3). Plugging these into the quadratic gives a=7 and b=49. The enumerated solutions approximate these exact values.
