[write_program]
This problem involves finding conditions on positive integers m and n such that the polynomial sum_{k=0}^m X^{n*k} is divisible by the polynomial sum_{k=0}^m X^k. We'll write a program to enumerate small values of m and n where this divisibility holds.

The approach is:
1. For small m and n values, construct both polynomials
2. Check if the first polynomial is divisible by the second
3. Output (m,n) pairs where divisibility holds

```python
from sympy import symbols, Poly, div, ZZ

X = symbols('X')

def check_divisibility(m, n):
    """Check if sum(X^(n*k)) is divisible by sum(X^k) for k=0..m"""
    sum_Xnk = sum(X**(n*k) for k in range(m+1))
    sum_Xk = sum(X**k for k in range(m+1))
    try:
        quotient, remainder = div(sum_Xnk, sum_Xk, domain=ZZ)
        return remainder == 0
    except:
        return False

max_m = 10
max_n = 20

print(f"Checking for m up to {max_m}, n up to {max_n}:")
for m in range(1, max_m+1):
    for n in range(1, max_n+1):
        if check_divisibility(m, n):
            print(f"Found valid pair: (m={m}, n={n})")
```
