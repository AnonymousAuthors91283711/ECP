This problem is a simple set theory question asking for the number of people with black hair but no glasses, given:
- Total people: 20
- Black hair: 10
- Glasses: 5
- Both black hair and glasses: 3

The answer is simply blackHair - both = 10 - 3 = 7. Since this is straightforward, we'll just print the calculation.

```python
# Problem parameters
total = 20
black_hair = 10
glasses = 5
both = 3

# Calculate and print the answer
answer = black_hair - both
print(answer)
```
