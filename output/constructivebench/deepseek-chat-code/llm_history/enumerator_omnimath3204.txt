This problem asks for the maximum possible sum of cos(3x_i) for 10 real numbers x_i whose sum of cosines is zero. We'll approach this by:

1. Using the triple angle formula: cos(3x) = 4cosÂ³x - 3cosx
2. Enumerating possible distributions of cosine values that sum to zero
3. Calculating the corresponding sum of triple angle terms
4. Finding the maximum value among these possibilities

The most promising case appears when most cosines are 1 or -1, with the remaining values balancing the sum to zero. We'll test small integer cases.

```python
import math

def main():
    # We'll test cases with k values at 1, (10-2k) values at -0.5, and k values at -0.5
    # This ensures the sum of cos(x_i) = 0
    max_sum = -float('inf')
    
    for k in range(0, 11):
        # Calculate how many -0.5's we need to balance k 1's
        # Equation: k*1 + (10-k)*c = 0 => c = -k/(10-k)
        if k == 10:
            continue  # Would require division by zero
        
        c = -k / (10 - k)
        sum_cos3x = k*(4*1**3 - 3*1) + (10-k)*(4*c**3 - 3*c)
        
        print(f"Case {k} ones: sum cos(3x) = {sum_cos3x}")
        if sum_cos3x > max_sum:
            max_sum = sum_cos3x
    
    print(f"\nMaximum sum found: {max_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
