[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest integer n > 1 where there exists a palindromic sequence of length n where each element i (0-based) satisfies that i+1 is in the sequence. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible sequences and find the minimal n.

The approach:
1. For each n starting from 2 upwards, generate all possible sequences of length n containing numbers from 1 to n
2. Check if the sequence is palindromic
3. Check if for every index i (0-based), i+1 appears in the sequence
4. The first n where such a sequence exists is our answer

```python
def is_palindromic(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def satisfies_condition(n, s):
    return all(i+1 in s for i in range(n))

def find_min_n(max_n=10):
    for n in range(2, max_n+1):
        # Generate all possible sequences of length n with elements 1..n
        # Using itertools.product to generate all possible combinations
        from itertools import product
        
        found = False
        for candidate in product(range(1, n+1), repeat=n):
            if is_palindromic(candidate) and satisfies_condition(n, candidate):
                print(f"Found for n={n}: {candidate}")
                found = True
                break  # We only need one example per n
        
        if found:
            return n  # Since we're checking in order, first found is minimal
    
    print(f"No solution found up to n={max_n}")
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    min_n = find_min_n()
    if min_n is not None:
        print(f"Minimal n is: {min_n}")
```
