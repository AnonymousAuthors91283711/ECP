| n + 2 => tilingCount (n + 1) + tilingCount n

theorem omnimath754 : tilingCount 10 = omnimath754_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Counting domino tilings of 2×n rectangle:
n=2: 2
n=3: 3
n=4: 5
n=5: 8
n=6: 13
n=7: 21
n=8: 34
n=9: 55
n=10: 89

Final answer for n=10: 89
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<89>>>
