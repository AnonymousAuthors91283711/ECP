Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0, 2), (1, 1, 2), (2, 2, 3)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1, 2), (2, 2, 3)}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but missing the case (0, 0, 2). The ground truth includes all solutions where p is prime and p^x - y^p = 1, which includes the case when x=0 and y=0 (since 2^0 - 0^2 = 1 - 0 = 1). The proposed answer correctly includes the other two cases but omits this edge case.
