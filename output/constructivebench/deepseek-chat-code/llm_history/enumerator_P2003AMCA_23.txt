[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of square divisors of the product of factorials from 1! to 9!. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all square numbers that divide this product.

Approach:
1. Compute the product of factorials from 1! to 9!
2. Factorize this product into its prime factors
3. For each prime factor, determine its exponent in the factorization
4. Generate all possible combinations of exponents (divided by 2 since we want square divisors)
5. Count all valid combinations

```python
import math
from collections import defaultdict

def main():
    # Compute product of factorials from 1! to 9!
    product = 1
    for i in range(1, 10):
        product *= math.factorial(i)
    
    # Factorize the product
    factors = defaultdict(int)
    n = product
    # Handle 2 separately
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors[2] += 1
        n = n // 2
    # Check odd divisors up to sqrt(n)
    i = 3
    max_factor = math.isqrt(n) + 1
    while i <= max_factor:
        while n % i == 0:
            factors[i] += 1
            n = n // i
            max_factor = math.isqrt(n) + 1
        i += 2
    if n > 1:
        factors[n] += 1
    
    # Get prime exponents
    exponents = list(factors.values())
    
    # Count square divisors
    count = 1
    for e in exponents:
        count *= (e // 2) + 1
    
    print(count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
