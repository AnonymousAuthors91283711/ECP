[write_program]
The problem asks to count the number of 5-tuples (a,b,c,d,e) of positive integers where:
1. a*b*c*d*e ≤ a+b+c+d+e
2. a+b+c+d+e ≤ 10

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible tuples satisfying these conditions. Since the sum is ≤10, we can efficiently brute-force all combinations.

```python
from itertools import product

count = 0
max_sum = 10

# Iterate through all possible 5-tuples with sum <=10
for a in range(1, max_sum + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_sum - a + 2):
        remaining_after_ab = max_sum - a - b
        for c in range(1, remaining_after_ab + 2):
            remaining_after_abc = max_sum - a - b - c
            for d in range(1, remaining_after_abc + 2):
                e = max_sum - a - b - c - d
                if e >= 1:
                    product_abcde = a * b * c * d * e
                    sum_abcde = a + b + c + d + e
                    if product_abcde <= sum_abcde:
                        count += 1
                        print((a, b, c, d, e))  # Print each valid tuple

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
