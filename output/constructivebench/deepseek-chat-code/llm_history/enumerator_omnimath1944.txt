This problem asks for the number of bijective functions (permutations) from Fin 5 â†’ Fin 5 where for any two indices i,j, if their difference is at least 3, then f(j) < f(i). We'll enumerate all permutations of 5 elements and count those satisfying the condition.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def satisfies_condition(perm):
    # Check condition: if |i-j| >= 3, then perm[j] < perm[i]
    for i in range(5):
        for j in range(5):
            if abs(i - j) >= 3 and perm[j] >= perm[i]:
                return False
    return True

count = 0
for p in permutations(range(5)):
    if satisfies_condition(p):
        print(p)  # Print each valid permutation
        count += 1

print("Total count:", count)
```
