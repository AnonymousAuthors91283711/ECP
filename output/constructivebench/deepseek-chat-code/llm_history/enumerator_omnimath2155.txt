[write_program]
This problem asks for the count of numbers between 4 and 2014 (inclusive) that satisfy two conditions:
1. The number modulo 5 equals 4 (n % 5 == 4)
2. The sum of its decimal digits is even (sum(map(int, str(n)))) % 2 == 0)

We'll write a Python program to enumerate and count these numbers efficiently.

```python
def is_even_digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n)) % 2 == 0

count = 0
for n in range(4, 2015):
    if n % 5 == 4 and is_even_digit_sum(n):
        count += 1
        print(n)  # Stream partial results

print("Final count:", count)
```
