[write_program]
The problem appears to be about finding natural numbers n and b (both â‰¥ 2) where a specific rational expression equals some fixed value (omnimath2331_answer), and this only holds when n=10. We'll write a program to search for such (n,b) pairs that satisfy the equation, looking for patterns.

The equation simplifies to (n*b)/((n+b)*(n+b-1)) = constant. We'll:
1. Iterate n from 2 to some reasonable limit
2. For each n, iterate b from 2 to some limit
3. Compute the expression and look for cases where it equals the same value across different b's for a fixed n
4. Print interesting cases where multiple b's give the same value

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    max_n = 20
    max_b = 50
    
    for n in range(2, max_n + 1):
        results = {}
        for b in range(2, max_b + 1):
            numerator = n * b
            denominator = (n + b) * (n + b - 1)
            value = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
            
            if value not in results:
                results[value] = []
            results[value].append(b)
        
        # Print cases where multiple b's give same value
        for val, bs in results.items():
            if len(bs) > 1:
                print(f"n={n}: value {val} occurs for b={bs}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
