[write_program]
This problem asks for pairs of positive integers (m, n) where the product of (2^n - 2^i) for i from 0 to n-1 equals m factorial. We'll write a Python program to search for such pairs by:
1. Iterating over possible n values
2. Computing the product for each n
3. Checking if the product is a factorial of some m
4. Outputting valid (m, n) pairs

We'll limit our search to small values since factorials grow very rapidly.

```python
import math

def find_pairs(max_n=10):
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        product = 1
        for i in range(n):
            term = (2**n) - (2**i)
            product *= term
        
        # Check if product is a factorial
        m = 1
        while math.factorial(m) <= product:
            if math.factorial(m) == product:
                print(f"Found pair: (m={m}, n={n})")
                break
            m += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Searching for (m, n) pairs where product equals m!...")
    find_pairs()
```
