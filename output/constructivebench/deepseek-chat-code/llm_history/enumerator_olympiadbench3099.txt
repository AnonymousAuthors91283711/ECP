This problem involves calculating the combined work rate of three people (Dennis, Edward, Shawn) and finding how much work they can complete in 2 hours. The rates are given in minutes per task (Dennis: 48 min/task, Edward: 48 min/task, Shawn: 24 min/task). We'll convert these to tasks per hour and compute the total work done in 2 hours.

```python
# Calculate individual rates in tasks/hour and total work in 2 hours
dennis_rate = 60 / 48  # tasks per hour
edward_rate = 60 / 48
shawn_rate = 60 / 24
total_rate = dennis_rate + edward_rate + shawn_rate
work_in_2_hours = total_rate * 2

# Output the exact value (as float) and simplified fraction
print(f"Total work in 2 hours: {work_in_2_hours} tasks")
print(f"Simplified fraction: {int(work_in_2_hours*2)}/2 tasks")
```
