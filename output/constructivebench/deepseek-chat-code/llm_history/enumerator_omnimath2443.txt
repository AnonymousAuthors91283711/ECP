[write_program]
This problem asks for which rational values of `a` there exists a 4×4 matrix `B` whose square equals the given matrix. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible rational values of `a` and check if they satisfy the condition.

The approach is:
1. Symbolically compute B² for a general 4×4 matrix B
2. Set up equations by equating each entry to the given matrix
3. Solve the system of equations to find possible values of `a`

```python
import sympy as sp

def find_possible_a_values():
    # Define symbolic variables for matrix B and parameter a
    B = sp.Matrix(sp.symbols('b0:16', real=True)).reshape(4, 4)
    a = sp.symbols('a', real=True)
    
    # Given target matrix
    target = sp.Matrix([
        [a, -a, -1, 0],
        [a, -a, 0, -1],
        [1, 0, a, -a],
        [0, 1, a, -a]
    ])
    
    # Compute B squared
    B_squared = B * B
    
    # Set up equations by comparing entries
    equations = []
    for i in range(4):
        for j in range(4):
            equations.append(sp.Eq(B_squared[i,j], target[i,j]))
    
    # Try to solve the system
    solutions = sp.solve(equations, dict=True)
    
    # Extract possible a values from solutions
    a_values = set()
    for sol in solutions:
        if a in sol:
            a_values.add(sol[a])
    
    return a_values

# Execute and print results
possible_a = find_possible_a_values()
print("Possible values of a:")
for a_val in possible_a:
    print(a_val)
```
