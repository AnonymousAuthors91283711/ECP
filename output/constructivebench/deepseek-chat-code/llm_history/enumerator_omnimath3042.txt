This problem involves solving a system of two quadratic equations with two variables x and y. We'll approach it by treating it as a system of equations and solving for x+y. The key insight is to find combinations of the equations that eliminate the cross term xy.

Here's a Python program that numerically verifies possible solutions by solving the system of equations:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the system of equations as a matrix equation
def solve_system():
    # Equation coefficients: 
    # x² + 3xy + y² = 909
    # 3x² + xy + 3y² = 1287
    
    # Let s = x + y, p = xy
    # Then:
    # x² + y² = s² - 2p
    # So first equation becomes: s² - 2p + 3p = 909 => s² + p = 909
    # Second equation: 3(s² - 2p) + p = 1287 => 3s² - 5p = 1287
    
    # Now we have:
    # s² + p = 909
    # 3s² - 5p = 1287
    
    # Solve this linear system for s² and p
    A = np.array([[1, 1], [3, -5]])
    b = np.array([909, 1287])
    solution = np.linalg.solve(A, b)
    
    s_squared = solution[0]
    p = solution[1]
    
    # s = x + y, so possible values are ±√s_squared
    possible_s = [np.sqrt(s_squared), -np.sqrt(s_squared)]
    
    for s in possible_s:
        print(f"Possible solution: x + y = {s}")

solve_system()
```

The program solves the system by:
1. Expressing x²+y² in terms of s=x+y and p=xy
2. Rewriting both original equations in terms of s and p
3. Solving the resulting linear system for s² and p
4. Calculating possible values of s (both positive and negative roots)

This gives exact solutions (up to floating point precision) without needing to enumerate values. The output will show the two possible values for x+y that satisfy both equations.
