This problem asks for the sum of five distinct integers a, b, c, d, e such that (6-a)(6-b)(6-c)(6-d)(6-e) = 45. We need to enumerate all possible combinations of distinct integers whose product equals 45 and then compute their sum.

The approach is:
1. Find all possible factorizations of 45 into 5 distinct integers (including negative numbers)
2. For each factorization, compute the original numbers by solving 6-x = factor
3. Sum all valid combinations and look for consistent sums

```python
from itertools import combinations

def find_factors():
    target = 45
    # Find all possible combinations of 5 distinct factors of 45 (including negatives)
    factors = []
    # Generate all possible factor combinations (positive and negative)
    possible = [1, -1, 3, -3, 5, -5, 9, -9, 15, -15, 45, -45]
    
    for comb in combinations(possible, 5):
        product = 1
        for num in comb:
            product *= num
        if product == target and len(set(comb)) == 5:  # distinct factors
            original_nums = [6 - x for x in comb]
            if len(set(original_nums)) == 5:  # original numbers must be distinct
                factors.append(original_nums)
    
    return factors

factors = find_factors()
for nums in factors:
    print(f"Numbers: {nums}, Sum: {sum(nums)}")

# After checking all possibilities, output the consistent sum
if factors:
    print(f"Consistent sum: {sum(factors[0])}")
else:
    print("No valid combinations found")
```
