Ground Truth Answer: Real.sqrt 3
Proposed Answer: 1 + Real.sqrt 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is a logarithmic equation that needs to be solved for x, with constraints x > 1 (from h1) and x > -2 (from h2).

2. The ground truth answer is √3 (approximately 1.732).

3. The proposed answer is 1 + √3 (approximately 2.732).

4. Let's verify if the proposed answer satisfies the original equation:
   - For x = 1 + √3:
     - Left side: 2*log₂(√3)
     - Right side: 1 - log₂(3 + √3)
   These are clearly not equal (log₂(√3) ≈ 0.792, while 1 - log₂(3+√3) ≈ -1.449).

5. The correct solution should be x = √3, which when substituted:
   - Left side: 2*log₂(√3 - 1) ≈ -1.512
   - Right side: 1 - log₂(√3 + 2) ≈ -1.512
   These are equal.

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the original equation, while the ground truth answer does.

<<<False>>>
