This problem asks for the minimum value of |x-y| + |y-z| where (x,y,z) are real numbers satisfying:
0 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ 4
x² + 2 = y²
y² + 2 = z²

We'll enumerate possible solutions by solving the equations and checking the constraints.

```python
import math

def find_solutions():
    # Since z^2 = y^2 + 2 and y^2 = x^2 + 2, we have z^2 = x^2 + 4
    # Also 0 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ 4
    # We'll iterate possible x values and check constraints
    
    min_sum = float('inf')
    
    # Try exact solutions first
    for x in [0, math.sqrt(2), 2, math.sqrt(6)]:
        y_squared = x*x + 2
        if y_squared < 0:
            continue
        y = math.sqrt(y_squared)
        z_squared = y_squared + 2
        if z_squared < 0:
            continue
        z = math.sqrt(z_squared)
        
        if 0 <= x <= y <= z <= 4:
            current_sum = abs(x - y) + abs(y - z)
            print(f"x={x:.6f}, y={y:.6f}, z={z:.6f}, sum={current_sum:.6f}")
            if current_sum < min_sum:
                min_sum = current_sum
    
    # Check if we found the minimal sum
    if min_sum != float('inf'):
        print(f"\nMinimum sum found: {min_sum:.6f}")

find_solutions()
