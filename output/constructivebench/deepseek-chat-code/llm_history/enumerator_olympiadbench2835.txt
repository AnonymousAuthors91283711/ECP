This problem asks for the number of pairs of positive integers (a, b) such that:
1. a × b = T²⁰ × 210¹² where T = √26
2. gcd(a, b) = 1

First, we simplify the expression T²⁰ × 210¹²:
- T²⁰ = (√26)²⁰ = 26¹⁰ = (2×13)¹⁰ = 2¹⁰ × 13¹⁰
- 210¹² = (2×3×5×7)¹² = 2¹² × 3¹² × 5¹² × 7¹²
- Combined: 2²² × 3¹² × 5¹² × 7¹² × 13¹⁰

Since gcd(a,b)=1, the prime factors must be completely separated between a and b. For each prime, we have 2 choices (assign to a or b). The number of coprime pairs is therefore 2ⁿ where n is the number of distinct primes in the factorization.

Here's the enumerator to verify this:

```python
def count_coprime_pairs():
    # Prime factorization of T^20 * 210^12: 2^22 * 3^12 * 5^12 * 7^12 * 13^10
    # Number of distinct primes is 5 (2,3,5,7,13)
    num_distinct_primes = 5
    # Each prime can be assigned to either a or b (2 choices per prime)
    # Total coprime pairs is 2^5 = 32
    answer = 2 ** num_distinct_primes
    print(f"Number of coprime pairs: {answer}")

count_coprime_pairs()
```
