[write_program]
This problem asks for the largest integer k such that there exists a partition of the natural numbers into k pairwise disjoint sets where for each set A_i and any n ≥ 15, there exist two distinct elements x,y ∈ A_i with x + y = n.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible k values and verify the conditions for small k. The approach is to:
1. Try partitions of natural numbers into k sets
2. Check if for each set, every n ≥ 15 can be expressed as sum of two distinct elements in the set

Since the problem is theoretical, we'll limit our enumeration to small k values and simple partition patterns.

```python
def verify_partition(k, max_check=30):
    """Check if a partition into k sets satisfies the condition up to max_check."""
    # Try simple modulo partitions first
    for m in range(1, k+1):
        # Check if k divides m and m covers all residues needed
        if k % m != 0:
            continue
        
        valid = True
        for n in range(15, max_check+1):
            for i in range(m):
                found = False
                # Check all possible pairs in this residue class
                for x in range(1, n):
                    y = n - x
                    if y <= 0:
                        continue
                    if x % m == i and y % m == i and x != y:
                        found = True
                        break
                if not found:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            print(f"Valid partition found for k={k} using modulo {m}")
            return True
    return False

def main():
    max_k = 10  # Reasonable upper bound for enumeration
    for k in range(1, max_k+1):
        if verify_partition(k):
            print(f"{k} is a possible candidate")
    
    print("Enumerated possible k values up to", max_k)
