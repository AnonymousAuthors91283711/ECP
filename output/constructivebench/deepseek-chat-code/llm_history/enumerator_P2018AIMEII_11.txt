This problem asks for the number of bijective functions (permutations) on 6 elements where for every k from 1 to 5, there exists some i < k such that f(i) > k. We'll enumerate all permutations of 6 elements and count those satisfying the condition.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def is_valid(perm):
    n = len(perm)
    for k in range(1, n):  # k from 1 to 5
        found = False
        for i in range(k):  # i < k
            if perm[i] > k:
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            return False
    return True

def count_valid_permutations():
    count = 0
    n = 6
    for perm in permutations(range(n)):
        if is_valid(perm):
            count += 1
            print(perm)  # Print valid permutations as they're found
    print(f"Total valid permutations: {count}")

count_valid_permutations()
```
