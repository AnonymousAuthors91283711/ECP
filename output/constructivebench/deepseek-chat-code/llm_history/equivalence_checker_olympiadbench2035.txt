Ground Truth Answer: 8 / (7 ^ (1/3))
Proposed Answer: 4 * (25 / (25 + 7))^(1/3)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the maximum value of a cyclic sum of fractional cube roots under given constraints.

2. The ground truth answer is 8/(7^(1/3)), which simplifies to approximately 4.308.

3. The proposed answer is 4*(25/(25+7))^(1/3), which evaluates to 4*(25/32)^(1/3) ≈ 4*0.928 ≈ 3.712.

4. The proposed answer is smaller than the ground truth answer, and they are clearly different expressions.

5. The ground truth answer is correct when considering the case where three variables are 0 and one is 100 (which gives 100/(0+7)^(1/3) ≈ 4.308), while the proposed answer seems to consider equal distribution (25 for each variable).

6. The maximum actually occurs when one variable is maximized and others are minimized, not when they're equal.
