Quadratic function f(x) = 1x^2 + 0x + 0. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
The error occurs because Lean is interpreting `0` as a Prop (proposition) when it should be a real number. We need to specify that we're using the real number zero (`(0 : ℝ)`). Also, the set notation needs to use proper logical connectives (`∨` should be between complete propositions).

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<{f : ℝ → ℝ | f = (fun _ => (0 : ℝ)) ∨ (∃ c, f = (fun x => x^2 + c))}>>>

Explanation:
1. The error was fixed by explicitly typing the zero constant as `(0 : ℝ)`
2. The set comprehension now properly uses `∨` between complete propositions:
   - `f = (fun _ => (0 : ℝ))` (constant zero function)
   - `(∃ c, f = (fun x => x^2 + c))` (quadratic functions with arbitrary constant term)
3. The answer matches the enumerated patterns which showed both the zero function and quadratic functions as solutions
4. The `∃` symbol is used instead of `∃` for existential quantification in Lean

This formulation captures both the zero function and all quadratic functions of the form x² + c that satisfy the given functional equation.
