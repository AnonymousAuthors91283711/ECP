This problem is about finding a 3-digit number (abc) in base 9 that satisfies two equations when interpreted in two different ways. The first equation treats it as a base-9 number (c*81 + b*9 + a), while the second equation rotates the digits (a*81 + b*9 + c). We need to find all such numbers where each digit is less than 9.

The Python program will iterate through all possible 3-digit base-9 numbers (100-888 in base 9, which is 81-728 in decimal) and check the two conditions. For each valid number, it will print the decimal value and its base-9 digits.

```python
def base9_digits(n):
    """Convert a number to its base-9 digits as a tuple (a,b,c) representing abc in base9"""
    c = n // 81
    remainder = n % 81
    b = remainder // 9
    a = remainder % 9
    return (a, b, c)

for n in range(81, 729):  # 100 to 888 in base9
    a, b, c = base9_digits(n)
    if a >= 9 or b >= 9 or c >= 9:
        continue  # digits must be <9 in base9
    # First interpretation: c*81 + b*9 + a
    val1 = c*81 + b*9 + a
    # Second interpretation (rotated): a*81 + b*9 + c
    val2 = a*81 + b*9 + c
    if val1 == val2 == n:
        print(f"Found: {n} (base9: {c}{b}{a})")
```
