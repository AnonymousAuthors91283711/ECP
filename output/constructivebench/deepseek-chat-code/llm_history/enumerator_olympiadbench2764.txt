This problem asks for the least integer value y such that there exists a real x where f(x) = y, with f(x) = (x⁴ - 6x³ + 2x² - 6x + 2)/(x² + 1). We'll approach this by:

1. Simplifying the rational function to make analysis easier
2. Finding the minimum value of the simplified function
3. Checking integer values around this minimum

The key observation is that we can perform polynomial long division to simplify f(x). The numerator can be written as (x²+1)(x²-6x+1), so f(x) simplifies to x² - 6x + 1.

Now we just need to find the minimum of the quadratic x² - 6x + 1, which occurs at x = 3, giving f(3) = -8. We'll check integer values around this minimum to find the least integer in the range.

```python
def simplified_f(x):
    return x**2 - 6*x + 1

# Find the minimum of the quadratic (vertex at x = -b/2a)
min_x = 6 / 2  # 6/(2*1)
min_val = simplified_f(min_x)
print(f"Minimum value of f(x): {min_val}")

# Check integer values around the minimum
lower_bound = int(min_val) - 2
upper_bound = int(min_val) + 2

found_values = set()
for y in range(lower_bound, upper_bound + 1):
    # Check if y is in the range of f(x)
    # For a quadratic ax²+bx+c, range is [vertex, ∞) or (-∞, vertex]
    # Since a=1>0, range is [vertex, ∞)
    if y >= min_val:
        found_values.add(y)
        print(f"Found attainable integer: {y}")

# The least integer in the range is the ceiling of the minimum
least_integer = int(min_val) if min_val == int(min_val) else int(min_val) + 1
print(f"Least integer in the range: {least_integer}")
```
