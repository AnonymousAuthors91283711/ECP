. Enumerated Answers: 26. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The error occurs because the proposed answer tries to use variables `a, b, c, d, e` that are not in scope for the abbreviation. We need to express the answer purely in terms of the given averages.

From the problem:
1. `(a + b + c)/3 = 16` ⇒ `a + b + c = 48`
2. `(c + d + e)/3 = 26` ⇒ `c + d + e = 78`
3. `(a + b + c + d + e)/5 = 20` ⇒ `a + b + c + d + e = 100`

To find `c`, we can add the first two equations and subtract the third:
`(a + b + c) + (c + d + e) - (a + b + c + d + e) = 48 + 78 - 100 = 26`
This simplifies to `c = 26`.

Here's the corrected Lean answer:

<<<26>>>
