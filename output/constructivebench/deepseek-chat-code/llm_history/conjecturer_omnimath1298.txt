Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ → ℕ
The problem counts valid binary sequences with n falses and m trues where no prefix has both odd counts of falses and trues. The enumerated answer shows 78 valid sequences for n=8, m=14. The general solution appears to be the difference between total combinations and invalid ones.

<<<fun (n, m) => choose (n + m) n - choose (n + m) (n + 1)>>>
