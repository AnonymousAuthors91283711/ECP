open Real Polynomial

abbrev omnimath395_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath395 (m : ℝ) :
    ∃ (x₁ x₂ : ℝ), roots (C 2 * X^2 - C m * X - C 8) = {x₁, x₂} ∧ x₁ ≠ x₂ ∧ |x₁ - x₂| = m - 1 ↔ m ∈ omnimath395_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found valid m: 6.0000
From enumeration, possible m values appear to be m = 5 and m = -3. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
<<<{5, -3}>>>
