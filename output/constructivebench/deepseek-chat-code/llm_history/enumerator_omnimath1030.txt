[write_program]
This problem involves finding the smallest integer m ≥ 2005 such that (a(m+1)-1) divides (a(m)^2-1), where a(n) is defined by the recurrence relation a(1)=3 and a(n+1)=(n+1)*a(n)-n for n≥1.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Compute the sequence a(n) using the recurrence
2. For each m ≥ 2005, check if (a(m+1)-1) divides (a(m)^2-1)
3. Output the first m that satisfies this condition (which will be the minimal solution)

```python
def compute_a(n):
    """Compute a(n) using the recurrence relation"""
    a = 3  # a(1) = 3
    for k in range(2, n+1):
        a = k * a - (k-1)
    return a

# We'll search up to m = 2100 which should be sufficient
for m in range(2005, 2101):
    a_m = compute_a(m)
    a_m_plus_1 = (m+1) * a_m - m
    numerator = a_m * a_m - 1
    denominator = a_m_plus_1 - 1
    if numerator % denominator == 0:
        print(f"Found solution at m = {m}")
        break
```
