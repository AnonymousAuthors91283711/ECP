[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of equations with two variables x and y. We'll approach it by:
1. Making substitutions to simplify the equations
2. Finding possible integer solutions
3. Verifying them against the original equations
4. Computing the required expression for valid solutions

We'll use the substitution u = xy and v = x + y, which is common for symmetric equations like these. The program will enumerate possible integer values for u and v, check if they satisfy the given equations, and then compute the target expression.

```python
import math

def solve_problem():
    # We'll search for integer solutions first since the RHS values are integers
    for u in range(1, 20):  # u = xy
        for v in range(1, 20):  # v = x + y
            # The equations can be rewritten in terms of u and v
            # First equation: u^4*(v^2 - 2u) = 810
            # Second equation: u^3*(v^3 - 3u*v) = 945
            try:
                lhs1 = u**4 * (v**2 - 2*u)
                lhs2 = u**3 * (v**3 - 3*u*v)
                if abs(lhs1 - 810) < 1e-6 and abs(lhs2 - 945) < 1e-6:
                    # Now solve for x and y (roots of t^2 - v*t + u = 0)
                    discriminant = v**2 - 4*u
                    if discriminant >= 0:
                        sqrt_disc = math.sqrt(discriminant)
                        x1 = (v + sqrt_disc)/2
                        y1 = (v - sqrt_disc)/2
                        x2 = (v - sqrt_disc)/2
                        y2 = (v + sqrt_disc)/2
                        
                        # Compute the target expression
                        expr1 = 2*x1**3 + (x1*y1)**3 + 2*y1**3
                        expr2 = 2*x2**3 + (x2*y2)**3 + 2*y2**3
                        
                        print(f"Found solution: u={u}, v={v}")
                        print(f"  (x,y) pairs: ({x1:.3f}, {y1:.3f}), ({x2:.3f}, {y2:.3f})")
                        print(f"  Expression value: {expr1:.3f}")
                        return
            except:
                continue

    print("No integer solutions found in the search range")
