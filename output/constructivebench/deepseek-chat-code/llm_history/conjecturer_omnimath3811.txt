<<<2730>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks for the count of numbers n > 1 where n divides x^13 - x for all positive integers x. This is equivalent to finding squarefree numbers whose prime factors all satisfy p-1 dividing 12 (by Fermat's Little Theorem generalization). The answer is the product of primes p where p-1 divides 12: 2*3*5*7*13 = 2730.
