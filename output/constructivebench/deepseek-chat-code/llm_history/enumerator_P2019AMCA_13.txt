This problem involves counting the number of valid colorings of 8 elements (represented as Fin 8) with 3 colors (Fin 3) under certain constraints. The constraint requires that for any two elements i and j where i < j and (i+2) divides (j+2), they must have different colors.

We'll approach this by:
1. Enumerating all possible colorings of 8 elements with 3 colors
2. Checking which colorings satisfy the given constraints
3. Counting the valid colorings

The program will systematically generate and check all possible colorings, counting those that meet the constraints.

```python
from itertools import product

def is_valid(coloring):
    n = len(coloring)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            # Check if (i+2) divides (j+2)
            if (j + 2) % (i + 2) == 0:
                if coloring[i] == coloring[j]:
                    return False
    return True

def count_valid_colorings():
    count = 0
    elements = 8
    colors = 3
    # Generate all possible colorings (3^8 possibilities)
    for coloring in product(range(colors), repeat=elements):
        if is_valid(coloring):
            count += 1
            print(coloring)  # Stream partial results
    print(f"Total valid colorings: {count}")

count_valid_colorings()
```
