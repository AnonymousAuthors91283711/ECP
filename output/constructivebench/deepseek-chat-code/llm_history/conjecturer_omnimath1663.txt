theorem omnimath1663 :
  ∃ (p q : ℚ[X]), degree p ≤ 2 ∧ degree q ≤ 2 ∧
  (∀ n ∈ ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5} : Finset ℕ), eval (n : ℚ) p / eval (n : ℚ) q = (n : ℚ)^3) ∧
  eval 0 p / eval 0 q = omnimath1663_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for valid (p, q) pairs with coefficients in (-3, 3)
No valid pairs found in the given coefficient range. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Based on the problem statement and the failed enumeration attempt, I notice that:
1. We need rational functions p/q that match n³ at n=1..5
2. The degrees are constrained to ≤2
3. The enumeration suggests a simple pattern might exist

The most likely answer is the constant rational function that matches all points, which would require p/q = n³ for all n. However, since degree ≤2 can't match n³ exactly, the only possibility is evaluating to 0 at n=0 (since 0³=0).
