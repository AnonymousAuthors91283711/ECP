This problem involves evaluating a complex double product of rational functions in x. To approach this, we'll:
1. Compute the product for small ranges (since 100 is too large)
2. Look for patterns in the simplified results
3. Try to conjecture a general formula

We'll use exact rational arithmetic via Python's fractions module to avoid floating point inaccuracies.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from math import prod

def compute_product(x_val, max_range=5):
    """Compute the double product for a given x value and small range."""
    x = Fraction(x_val) if isinstance(x_val, int) else x_val
    total = Fraction(1, 1)
    
    for m in range(max_range):
        for n in range(max_range):
            numerator = (x**(n+m) + x**(n+m+2) + x**(2*n+1) + x**(2*m+1))
            denominator = (x**(2*n) + 2*x**(n+m) + x**(2*m))
            term = numerator / denominator
            total *= term
    return total

# Test with small integer x values
for x in [2, 3, Fraction(1,2)]:
    print(f"x = {x}")
    for r in range(1, 6):
        res = compute_product(x, r)
        print(f"Range {r}x{r}: {res} (float: {float(res)})")
    print()
```
