This problem appears to be about solving a linear equation and verifying the solution. The equation is (1/5 + 1/7)*(t-1) = 1, and we need to find the value of t that satisfies it. The solution can be found by simple algebraic manipulation.

Here's a Python program that calculates the exact solution to this equation:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve_equation():
    # Calculate the sum of fractions 1/5 + 1/7
    left_coeff = Fraction(1, 5) + Fraction(1, 7)
    # The equation is left_coeff * (t - 1) = 1
    # Solving for t: t - 1 = 1 / left_coeff
    # Then t = 1 + (1 / left_coeff)
    t = 1 + (1 / left_coeff)
    # Print the exact fractional solution
    print(f"Exact solution: t = {t}")
    # Also print decimal approximation for reference
    print(f"Decimal approximation: t â‰ˆ {float(t):.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_equation()
```
