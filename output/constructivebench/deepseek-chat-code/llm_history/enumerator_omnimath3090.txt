This problem is about solving a simple linear equation for n and then computing another expression. The equation is 2n + 5 = 16, and we need to find the value of 2n - 3. 

First, we'll solve for n:
2n + 5 = 16 → 2n = 11 → n = 5.5

But since n is a natural number (ℕ), there is no solution in natural numbers. However, if we consider integer solutions, we can compute 2n - 3 = 2*5.5 - 3 = 8.

The Python program will demonstrate this by showing there's no natural number solution, then computing the integer solution.

```python
# Solving 2n + 5 = 16 for natural numbers n
print("Checking natural number solutions:")
found = False
for n in range(0, 20):  # Check reasonable range
    if 2 * n + 5 == 16:
        print(f"Solution found: n = {n}")
        print(f"2n - 3 = {2 * n - 3}")
        found = True
        break

if not found:
    print("No natural number solution exists")

# Showing the real solution
print("\nReal number solution:")
n = (16 - 5) / 2
print(f"n = {n}")
print(f"2n - 3 = {2 * n - 3}")
```
