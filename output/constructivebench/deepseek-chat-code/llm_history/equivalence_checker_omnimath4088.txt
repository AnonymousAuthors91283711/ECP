Ground Truth Answer: 721480000 / 27
Proposed Answer: 20 * 40 * 1955
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem asks for the maximum product x*y*z under given constraints.
2. The ground truth answer is 721480000/27 ≈ 26,721,481.48
3. The proposed answer is 20*40*1955 = 1,564,000

The proposed answer is the product when x and y are at their minimum values (20 and 40 respectively), forcing z to be 1955 (since 2015-20-40=1955). However, this is actually the *minimum* product under these constraints, not the maximum.

The maximum would occur when we maximize the product by making the values as close as possible given the constraints. The ground truth answer reflects this optimization.
