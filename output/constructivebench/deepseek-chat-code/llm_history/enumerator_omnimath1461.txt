This problem involves counting the number of ways to insert plus signs between 15 consecutive '1's such that the resulting expression evaluates to a multiple of 30. We'll approach this by enumerating all possible plus sign placements and checking the divisibility condition.

The key observations:
1. There are 14 possible positions between 15 '1's to place plus signs
2. Each position can either have a plus or not (binary choice)
3. We need to evaluate the resulting number(s) and check divisibility by 30
4. Since 30 = 2×3×5, the number must be divisible by all three primes

Here's a Python program that enumerates all possible configurations:

```python
from itertools import product

def evaluate(digits, ops):
    current = digits[0]
    total = 0
    for d, op in zip(digits[1:], ops):
        if op == '+':
            total += current
            current = d
        else:
            current = current * 10 + d
    total += current
    return total

def solve():
    digits = [1] * 15
    count = 0
    # Generate all possible plus configurations (True=plus, False=no plus)
    for ops in product([True, False], repeat=14):
        num = evaluate(digits, ops)
        if num % 30 == 0:
            count += 1
            print(f"Found valid configuration: {ops} evaluates to {num}")
    print(f"Total valid configurations: {count}")

solve()
```

The program:
1. Defines an evaluation function that computes the number formed by the digits and plus signs
2. Generates all possible plus sign configurations (2^14 = 16384 possibilities)
3. For each configuration, evaluates the number and checks divisibility by 30
4. Counts and prints all valid configurations
5. Outputs the total count at the end

Note that this brute-force approach is feasible because 2^14 is manageable (16384 cases). For larger problems, a more sophisticated mathematical approach would be needed.
