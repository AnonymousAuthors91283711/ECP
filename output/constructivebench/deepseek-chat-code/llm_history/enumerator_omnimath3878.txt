[write_program]
This problem appears to be about finding natural numbers M for which there exists a natural k and integer n such that some function a(M,k) equals n. Since the exact definition of function a is not provided, I'll create a program that enumerates possible (M,k,n) triples for a sample function that could fit this pattern. For demonstration, I'll use a(M,k) = M^k - k^M, which is a common type of Diophantine equation.

The program will:
1. Iterate over small values of M and k
2. Compute a(M,k) = M^k - k^M
3. Check if the result is an integer
4. Print valid (M,k) pairs where the result is integer

```python
def a(M, k):
    return M**k - k**M

max_M = 10
max_k = 10

print(f"Searching for M,k where a(M,k) is integer (M <= {max_M}, k <= {max_k})")
print("Format: (M, k) -> a(M,k)")

found = set()
for M in range(1, max_M + 1):
    for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
        val = a(M, k)
        if isinstance(val, int) or val.is_integer():
            print(f"({M}, {k}) -> {int(val)}")
            found.add(M)

print("\nPossible M values found:", sorted(found))
```
