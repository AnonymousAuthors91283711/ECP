[write_program]
This problem involves finding all possible values of D (a sum of conditional terms) given that m + c + f + e = 1000. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible D values by iterating through possible combinations of m, c, f, e (with some optimizations to handle the large search space).

The approach:
1. Since m + c + f + e = 1000, we can reduce the problem to 3 variables
2. We'll iterate through possible values of m, c, f (with e = 1000 - m - c - f)
3. For each combination, we'll compute D according to the given formula
4. We'll collect all unique D values found

```python
def main():
    seen = set()
    total = 1000
    # We'll limit the search to reasonable ranges to keep it tractable
    max_m = min(1000, 100)  # Limit m to make computation feasible
    for m in range(0, max_m + 1):
        remaining_after_m = total - m
        max_c = min(remaining_after_m, 100)  # Limit c similarly
        for c in range(0, max_c + 1):
            remaining_after_c = remaining_after_m - c
            for f in range(0, remaining_after_c + 1):
                e = remaining_after_c - f
                # Compute D according to the formula
                D = 0
                if m > 0:
                    D += m * ((c + f + e) // m)
                if c > 0:
                    D += c * ((m + f + e) // c)
                if f > 0:
                    D += f * ((m + c + e) // f)
                if e > 0:
                    D += e * ((m + c + f) // e)
                if D not in seen:
                    seen.add(D)
                    print(D)
    print("Unique D values found:", sorted(seen))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
