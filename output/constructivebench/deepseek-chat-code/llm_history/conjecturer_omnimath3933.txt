The error occurs because Lean is interpreting `0` as a Prop (logical proposition) when we want it as a function. We need to properly define the zero function and use set notation correctly. The enumerated answers show constant zero and quadratic functions of form x² + c are solutions.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<{f | f = (fun x => 0) ∨ (∃ c, f = fun x => x^2 + c)}>>>

Explanation:
1. The zero function must be written as `fun x => 0` rather than just `0`
2. The set notation requires proper parentheses around the alternatives
3. The pattern matches the enumerated solutions:
   - Constant zero function (fun x => 0)
   - Quadratic functions (x² + c) with various constants c
4. The solution set includes all quadratic functions shifted vertically by any constant c, plus the zero function as a special case

The error was purely syntactic - we needed to properly express the zero function and structure the set definition correctly in Lean's syntax.
