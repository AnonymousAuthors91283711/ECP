[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of real solutions to the equation involving nested absolute values. We'll write a Python program to find all real solutions by analyzing the piecewise linear nature of the equation.

The approach:
1. Break down the nested absolute value functions into linear pieces by finding critical points
2. Solve the equation in each linear region
3. Count distinct real solutions

```python
def solve():
    # Critical points where any absolute value expression changes its behavior
    critical_points = [0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7]
    critical_points = sorted(set(critical_points))  # Remove duplicates and sort
    
    # Generate test intervals between critical points
    test_points = []
    test_points.extend(critical_points)
    test_points.extend([(a + b)/2 for a, b in zip(critical_points, critical_points[1:])])
    test_points.extend([-1, 8])  # Points outside the main range
    
    solutions = set()
    
    for x in test_points:
        # Left side of equation
        l1 = abs(x - 2)
        l2 = abs(l1 - 2)
        left = abs(l2 - 2)
        
        # Right side of equation
        r1 = abs(x - 3)
        r2 = abs(r1 - 3)
        right = abs(r2 - 3)
        
        if abs(left - right) < 1e-10:  # Account for floating point precision
            solutions.add(round(x, 10))  # Round to handle numerical noise
    
    # Check between found solutions for additional roots
    refined_points = []
    sol_list = sorted(solutions)
    for i in range(len(sol_list) - 1):
        a, b = sol_list[i], sol_list[i+1]
        for _ in range(3):  # Simple refinement steps
            mid = (a + b) / 2
            l1 = abs(mid - 2)
            l2 = abs(l1 - 2)
            left = abs(l2 - 2)
            r1 = abs(mid - 3)
            r2 = abs(r1 - 3)
            right = abs(r2 - 3)
            if abs(left - right) < 1e-10:
                solutions.add(round(mid, 10))
                break
            elif (left - right) * (abs(a - 2) - abs(a - 3)) < 0:
                b = mid
            else:
                a = mid
    
    # Print all found solutions
    for sol in sorted(solutions):
        print(sol)
    
    # The answer is the count of distinct solutions
    print(f"Total solutions found: {len(solutions)}")

solve()
```
