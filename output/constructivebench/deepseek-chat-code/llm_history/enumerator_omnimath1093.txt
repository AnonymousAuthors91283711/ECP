This problem asks for the set of differences between consecutive 5-digit palindromic numbers. We need to enumerate all 5-digit palindromes, compute consecutive differences, and collect the unique differences.

Here's a Python program that:
1. Generates all 5-digit palindromes (numbers that read the same forwards and backwards)
2. Sorts them in increasing order
3. Computes differences between consecutive palindromes
4. Prints each unique difference found
5. Finally prints the complete set of differences

```python
def is_palindrome(n):
    s = str(n)
    return s == s[::-1]

def generate_5digit_palindromes():
    palindromes = []
    for first in range(1, 10):  # first digit (1-9)
        for middle in range(0, 10):  # middle digit (0-9)
            for second in range(0, 10):  # second digit (0-9)
                # Construct palindrome: ABCBA format
                num = first * 10000 + second * 1000 + middle * 100 + second * 10 + first
                palindromes.append(num)
    return sorted(palindromes)

def main():
    palindromes = generate_5digit_palindromes()
    differences = set()
    
    for i in range(len(palindromes)-1):
        diff = palindromes[i+1] - palindromes[i]
        if diff not in differences:
            print(diff)
            differences.add(diff)
    
    print("Complete set of differences:", sorted(differences))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
