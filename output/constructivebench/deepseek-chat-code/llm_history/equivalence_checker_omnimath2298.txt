Ground Truth Answer: fun ⟨x, y⟩ => 2 * x + (y - x^2)
Proposed Answer: fun (x : ℝ × ℝ) => x.2 - x.1^2 + 2 * x.1 * 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding a + b given certain conditions about intersections of a line and a parabola.

2. The ground truth answer is: `fun ⟨x, y⟩ => 2 * x + (y - x^2)`
   - Simplified: `2x + y - x²` or `y - x² + 2x`

3. The proposed answer is: `fun (x : ℝ × ℝ) => x.2 - x.1^2 + 2 * x.1 * 5`
   - Simplified: `y - x² + 10x` (since x.1 is the first component, which is 5 in the context)

Key differences:
- The ground truth has `2x` while the proposed answer has `10x` (2*x.1*5)
- The proposed answer incorrectly multiplies by 5, which should just be x.1 (the first component of the pair)
- The ground truth correctly uses the pair components directly

The proposed answer is incorrect because it hardcodes the multiplication by 5 when it should just use the input variable.
