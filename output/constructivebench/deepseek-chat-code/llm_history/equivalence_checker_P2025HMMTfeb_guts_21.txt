Ground Truth Answer: (-5 - sqrt 5)/2
Proposed Answer: -(1 + Real.sqrt 5) / 2
Let's analyze the two answers:

Ground Truth: (-5 - √5)/2
Proposed: -(1 + √5)/2

Let's simplify both expressions:
Ground Truth: -5/2 - √5/2
Proposed: -1/2 - √5/2

These are clearly different expressions. The constant term is different (-5/2 vs -1/2) while the √5 term is the same (-√5/2 in both cases).

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
