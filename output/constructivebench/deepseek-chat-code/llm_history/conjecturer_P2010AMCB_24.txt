Total length of intervals: 2.50000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we need to compute the total length of three intervals where the function f(x) > 1. The intervals are:

1. I1: (-1, 1 - √2) with length (1 - √2) - (-1) = 2 - √2
2. I2: (0, 1/2) with length 1/2 - 0 = 1/2
3. I3: (1, 1 + √2) with length (1 + √2) - 1 = √2

The total length is (2 - √2) + (1/2) + √2 = 2 + 1/2 = 5/2. The error occurs because we need to mark the answer as noncomputable since it involves real numbers and square roots.

Here's the corrected answer:

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2010AMCB_24_answer : ℝ := 5/2>>>

The explanation is that we're summing the lengths of three intervals where the function exceeds 1, and the arithmetic simplifies to 5/2. The noncomputable annotation is needed because real number operations in Lean aren't always computable.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
