Ground Truth Answer: 652
Proposed Answer: 7 + 11 + 13 + 27001
Let me analyze this carefully:

1. First, let's verify the prime factors:
   - 7, 11, 13 are clearly primes
   - 27001 is a prime (we can verify this by checking divisibility up to √27001 ≈ 164.3)

2. Now check the product:
   7 × 11 × 13 × 27001 = 1001 × 27001 = 27000001 (correct)

3. Now check the sum:
   7 + 11 + 13 + 27001 = 31 + 27001 = 27032

4. Compare with ground truth:
   - Ground truth sum is 652
   - Proposed sum is 27032
   - These are clearly different

The proposed answer correctly identifies four primes whose product is 27000001, but their sum is incorrect compared to the ground truth. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
