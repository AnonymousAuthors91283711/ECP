Ground Truth Answer: 222
Proposed Answer: 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the count of numbers from 1 to 2017 (inclusive) that have no 0 digits in their base-3 representation.

2. The ground truth answer is 222, which is correct. This can be verified by:
   - Counting numbers with 1-7 digits in base-3 (since 3^7=2187 > 2017)
   - For each digit length, there are 2^d numbers (since each digit can be 1 or 2)
   - Summing 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^6 = 126 (for 1-6 digit numbers)
   - For 7-digit numbers, we count from 3^6=729 to 2017, which gives 96 more
   - Total is 126 + 96 = 222

3. The proposed answer is 2^6 + 2^5 + ... + 2^0 = 127, which:
   - Only counts numbers up to 6 digits (3^6=729)
   - Includes 2^0 which shouldn't be there (no 0-digit numbers)
   - Misses the 7-digit numbers from 729 to 2017

<<<False>>>
