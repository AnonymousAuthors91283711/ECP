[write_program]
This problem involves finding pairs of natural numbers (a, b) that satisfy either 2a + 3b = 100 or 3a + 2b = 100, with the additional constraint that either a = 28 or b = 28. We need to enumerate all possible solutions and verify the given theorem that the answer is 8 (though we won't state this conclusion in the output).

The Python program will:
1. Iterate through possible values of a and b
2. Check both equations with the given constraints
3. Print all valid pairs found

```python
def find_solutions():
    # Check cases where a=28 or b=28
    solutions = []
    
    # Case 1: a = 28
    a = 28
    # Try first equation: 2a + 3b = 100
    b1 = (100 - 2*a) / 3
    if b1.is_integer() and b1 >= 0:
        solutions.append((a, int(b1)))
    # Try second equation: 3a + 2b = 100
    b2 = (100 - 3*a) / 2
    if b2.is_integer() and b2 >= 0:
        solutions.append((a, int(b2)))
    
    # Case 2: b = 28
    b = 28
    # Try first equation: 2a + 3b = 100
    a1 = (100 - 3*b) / 2
    if a1.is_integer() and a1 >= 0:
        solutions.append((int(a1), b))
    # Try second equation: 3a + 2b = 100
    a2 = (100 - 2*b) / 3
    if a2.is_integer() and a2 >= 0:
        solutions.append((int(a2), b))
    
    # Print all solutions found
    for sol in solutions:
        print(f"Solution found: a={sol[0]}, b={sol[1]}")
    
    # Return the number of solutions (without stating the expected answer)
    print(f"Total solutions found: {len(solutions)}")

find_solutions()
