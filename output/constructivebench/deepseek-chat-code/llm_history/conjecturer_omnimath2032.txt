Total solutions: 49. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated solutions, we can observe several patterns:
1. Solutions where three coordinates are equal and the fourth is their negative (e.g., (-5,-5,-5,5))
2. Solutions where three coordinates are zero and one is arbitrary (e.g., (0,0,0,5))
3. Solutions with specific patterns like (-4,-2,-1,2)

The total count is 49, which is 7². This suggests the answer might be related to the number of integer points within the given bounds that satisfy certain symmetry conditions.
