This problem asks for the number of positive real numbers x satisfying (3*2^floor(log2(x)) - x)^16 = 2022*x^13. We'll approach it by:

1. Considering x in intervals [2^n, 2^(n+1)) where n is an integer
2. Within each interval, floor(log2(x)) = n, so the equation becomes (3*2^n - x)^16 = 2022*x^13
3. We'll numerically solve this equation in sample intervals to count solutions

```python
import math

def count_solutions():
    count = 0
    # Check negative n values (0 < x < 1)
    for n in range(-10, 0):
        a = 2**n
        b = 2**(n+1)
        # Function to find roots of: (3*2^n - x)^16 - 2022*x^13
        f = lambda x: (3*2**n - x)**16 - 2022*x**13
        # Check sign change (crude root detection)
        if f(a) * f(b) < 0:
            count += 1
    
    # Check positive n values (x >= 1)
    for n in range(0, 50):
        a = 2**n
        b = 2**(n+1)
        f = lambda x: (3*2**n - x)**16 - 2022*x**13
        # Check for possible multiple roots
        # We'll sample points to detect sign changes
        samples = 10
        prev_sign = math.copysign(1, f(a))
        roots_in_interval = 0
        for i in range(1, samples+1):
            x = a + (b-a)*i/samples
            current_sign = math.copysign(1, f(x))
            if current_sign != prev_sign:
                roots_in_interval += 1
            prev_sign = current_sign
        count += min(roots_in_interval, 2)  # At most 2 roots per interval
    
    print(f"Found {count} solutions")

count_solutions()
```
