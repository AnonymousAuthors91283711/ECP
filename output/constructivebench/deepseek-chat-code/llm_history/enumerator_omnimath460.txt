[write_program]
This problem involves finding a prime number p between 100 and 500 such that when we compute e = 2016 mod (p-1), the equation e - (1/2*(p-1)) = 21 holds. We'll write a Python program to search for such primes.

The approach is:
1. Iterate through all primes between 100 and 500
2. For each prime p, compute e = 2016 % (p-1)
3. Check if e - (p-1)/2 equals 21
4. Output any primes that satisfy this condition

```python
import sympy

def find_special_prime():
    for p in sympy.primerange(100, 500):
        e = 2016 % (p - 1)
        if e - (p - 1)/2 == 21:
            print(f"Found candidate prime: {p}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_special_prime()
```
