[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number u in a sequence of 9 consecutive numbers (n to n+8) that satisfies four specific equations involving sums of triplets. We'll write a Python program to find the minimal u for small values of n.

The approach:
1. For each n from 1 upwards, check all possible u values (n+8 is the maximum possible)
2. Verify all four equations for each candidate u
3. Stop when we find the smallest u that satisfies all conditions
4. Print results for small n values to observe patterns

```python
def find_min_u(n):
    a = n
    b = n+1
    c = n+2
    d = n+3
    e = n+4
    f = n+5
    g = n+6
    h = n+7
    
    # The possible u values are from n+8 down to n (but must be distinct)
    # We check from smallest to largest to find minimal u
    for u in range(n+8, n-1, -1):
        if u in {a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h}:
            continue
            
        sum_abc = a + b + c
        cond1 = (sum_abc == d + e + f)
        cond2 = (sum_abc == g + h + u)
        cond3 = (sum_abc == c + f + u)
        cond4 = (sum_abc == a + e + h)
        
        if cond1 and cond2 and cond3 and cond4:
            return u
    return None

# Check for small values of n
for n in range(1, 11):
    u = find_min_u(n)
    if u is not None:
        print(f"n={n}, minimal u={u}")
    else:
        print(f"n={n}, no solution found")
```
