Based on the problem statement and error message, the issue appears to be with the syntax in the `let` declarations. The error suggests we need proper line breaks between the `let` statements. The mathematical calculation itself seems correct - it's a standard expected value problem for geometric distribution where we're calculating how many additional darts need to be thrown to hit a smaller target circle.

The answer 6060 makes sense because:
1. Probability p = (10²)/(20²) = 100/400 = 1/4
2. Expected additional throws = initial_darts * (1/p - 1) = 2020 * (4 - 1) = 2020 * 3 = 6060

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<6060>>>

Explanation:
The problem involves calculating the expected number of additional dart throws needed to hit a smaller target circle (radius 10) within a larger circle (radius 20), starting with 2020 initial darts. The probability calculation is correct, and the enumerated answer matches our manual calculation. The error was purely syntactic (missing line break between `let` statements), not mathematical.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
