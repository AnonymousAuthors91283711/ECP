abbrev omnimath1306_answer : ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath1306 : 
  ∃ (a b c : ℤ) (f : ℤ[X]), 
    f = X^4 + C a * X^2 + C b * X + C c ∧ 
    (2 : ℤ) ∈ f.roots ∧ (-3 : ℤ) ∈ f.roots ∧ (5 : ℤ) ∈ f.roots ∧ 
    a + b + c = omnimath1306_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: k = -4: a = -27, b = -14, c = 120, a+b+c = 79. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
From the enumerated answer where a = -27, b = -14, c = 120, we see a+b+c = 79. The problem asks for a polynomial with roots at 2, -3, and 5, so the polynomial should be (X-2)(X+3)(X-5)(X-k) for some k. The sum a+b+c comes from expanding this and adding the coefficients of X², X, and constant term. The specific value 79 matches when k=-4.
