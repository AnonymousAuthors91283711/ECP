This problem involves finding the number of dimes (d) in a collection of coins (pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters) given two average value conditions. We'll translate the Lean problem into Python to enumerate possible solutions.

The key equations are:
1. (p + 5n + 10d + 25q)/(p+n+d+q) = 20
2. (p + 5n + 10d + 25(q+1))/(p+n+d+q+1) = 21

We'll:
1. Iterate through reasonable values for q (quarters)
2. For each q, solve for possible d (dimes) values
3. Check if the equations hold with integer solutions
4. Output valid (q,d) pairs and eventually the solution for d

```python
def solve():
    # Iterate possible quarter counts (q)
    for q in range(0, 20):
        # From first equation: total coins (tc) = p + n + d + q
        # total value (tv) = p + 5n + 10d + 25q = 20*tc
        # From second equation: (tv + 25)/(tc + 1) = 21 => tv + 25 = 21tc + 21
        # Substitute tv = 20tc => 20tc + 25 = 21tc + 21 => tc = 4
        tc = 4
        tv = 20 * tc
        
        # Now we have p + n + d = tc - q = 4 - q
        # and p + 5n + 10d = tv - 25q = 80 - 25q
        
        # Let s = p + n + d = 4 - q
        # Let t = p + 5n + 10d = 80 - 25q
        s = 4 - q
        if s < 0:
            continue  # q too large
        
        # We have two equations:
        # p + n + d = s
        # p + 5n + 10d = t
        
        # Subtract first from second: 4n + 9d = t - s
        rhs = (80 - 25*q) - (4 - q)
        # 4n + 9d = 76 - 24q
        
        # Now iterate possible d values
        max_d = (76 - 24*q) // 9 if (76 - 24*q) >= 0 else -1
        for d in range(0, max_d + 1):
            remaining = 76 - 24*q - 9*d
            if remaining >= 0 and remaining % 4 == 0:
                n = remaining // 4
                p = s - n - d
                if p >= 0 and n >= 0:
                    print(f"q={q}, d={d}, n={n}, p={p}")
                    # Verify equations
                    tc = p + n + d + q
                    tv = p + 5*n + 10*d + 25*q
                    if tc == 4 and tv == 80:
                        print(f"Valid solution found: d={d}")
                        return  # We found the minimal solution
