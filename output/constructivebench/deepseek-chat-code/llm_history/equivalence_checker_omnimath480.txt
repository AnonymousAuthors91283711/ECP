Ground Truth Answer: fun a b c => a * b^3 + b * c^3 + c * a^3
Proposed Answer: fun a b c => a^2 + b^2 + c^2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding a function of a, b, c that reaches its least value (18) under given constraints.

2. The ground truth answer is a symmetric cyclic sum: a*b³ + b*c³ + c*a³

3. The proposed answer is the sum of squares: a² + b² + c²

These are clearly different functions:
- The ground truth is a 4th degree polynomial (each term is degree 4)
- The proposed answer is a 2nd degree polynomial

They cannot be equivalent as they have different degrees and different forms. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth.
