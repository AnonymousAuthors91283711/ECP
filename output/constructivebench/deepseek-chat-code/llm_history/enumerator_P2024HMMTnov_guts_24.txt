This problem involves finding the greatest real number x such that applying the function f ↦ f² + 6f + 6 six times to x yields zero. We'll approach this by:

1. Understanding that we need to find the largest fixed point in the reverse iteration
2. Working backwards from 0 through each application of the inverse function
3. Keeping track of the largest real solution at each step

The function f(y) = y² + 6y + 6 can be inverted, but we must choose the correct branch to maintain real solutions. We'll implement this step-by-step inversion.

```python
import math

def f_inverse(y):
    """Returns both possible inverse solutions for f(x) = y"""
    discriminant = 6*6 - 4*1*(6 - y)
    if discriminant < 0:
        return []
    sqrt_disc = math.sqrt(discriminant)
    return [(-6 + sqrt_disc)/2, (-6 - sqrt_disc)/2]

def find_max_solution(iterations=6):
    """Finds the maximal real solution after specified iterations"""
    current_values = [0.0]  # Start with f^6(x) = 0
    for _ in range(iterations):
        next_values = []
        for val in current_values:
            inverses = f_inverse(val)
            next_values.extend(inverses)
        # Keep only real solutions and get unique values
        current_values = sorted(list(set([x for x in next_values if not math.isnan(x)])))
        print(f"After {iterations-_} iterations: solutions {current_values}")
    return max(current_values)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    max_sol = find_max_solution()
    print(f"\nThe greatest real solution is: {max_sol}")
```

The program works by:
1. Starting with the final condition (0)
2. At each step, applying the inverse function to all current values
3. Tracking all real solutions
4. Printing intermediate results and finally the maximal solution

Note that we keep both branches of the inverse function at each step to ensure we don't miss any potential solutions. The maximal solution will emerge from consistently choosing the larger branch at each inversion step.
