Ground Truth Answer: fun n => choose n 2 + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n * (n - 1) / 2 + 1
<<<True>>>

Explanation: 
The ground truth answer is given by the combination formula "choose n 2" (which is n choose 2) plus 1. The proposed answer is n*(n-1)/2 + 1. These are equivalent because:
n choose 2 = n!/(2!(n-2)!) = n*(n-1)/2
Therefore, both expressions represent the same mathematical function. The problem is about counting the maximum number of regions created by lines separating points in a plane, which indeed follows this formula.
