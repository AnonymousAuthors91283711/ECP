[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimal degree of a monic integer polynomial P(x) that has both √3+√2 and √3-√2 as roots, and then to compute P(10)-P(0) for such a minimal degree polynomial. We'll write a Python program to find this.

The approach is:
1. Construct the minimal polynomial of √3+√2 by eliminating radicals
2. Verify it also has √3-√2 as a root
3. Compute P(10)-P(0) for this polynomial

```python
def minimal_poly():
    # Coefficients of the minimal polynomial x^4 - 10x^2 + 1
    # Derived from: (x - (√3+√2))(x - (√3-√2))(x - (-√3+√2))(x - (-√3-√2))
    return [1, 0, -10, 0, 1]

def compute_difference(P):
    # Compute P(10) - P(0)
    return sum(c * (10**i - 0**i) for i, c in enumerate(P))

def main():
    P = minimal_poly()
    print(f"Minimal polynomial coefficients: {P}")
    result = compute_difference(P)
    print(f"P(10) - P(0) = {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
