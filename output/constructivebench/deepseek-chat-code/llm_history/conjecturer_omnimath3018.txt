  (∃ T ⊆ S, T.card = 3 ∧ (∏ t in T, t) = 80 ∧ (∑ t in T, t) = omnimath3018_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking all 3-element subsets of [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 20]
Looking for subsets with product = 80
Valid subsets and their sums:
Subset (1, 4, 20) has sum 25

All valid sums found: {25}. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
