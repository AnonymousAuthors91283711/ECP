theorem omnimath3706
(n : ℕ)
(nge1 : n ≥ 1)
: IsLeast {k : ℕ | k ≥ 2 ∧ ∀ S : Finset ℝ, S.card = k → ∃ x ∈ S, ∃ y ∈ S, x ≠ y ∧ (|x - y| < 1 / n ∨ |x - y| > n)} (omnimath3706_answer n) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: For n=1, minimal k is 3
For n=2, minimal k is 6
For n=3, no k ≤ 10 found
For n=4, no k ≤ 10 found
For n=5, no k ≤ 10 found. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Based on the pattern from n=1 and n=2, and considering the problem's nature about finding distinct points with specific distance conditions, the minimal k seems to follow n+2 for n=1 and 2n+2 for n=2. The general pattern appears to be quadratic in n.
