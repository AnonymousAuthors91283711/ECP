abbrev omnimath1911_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1911 :
  let S := Icc 1 6
  let A := card (Finset.univ : Finset (Sym2 (S ×ˢ S)))
  let B := card (Finset.univ : Finset (Sym2 S × Sym2 S))
  A - B = omnimath1911_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: For n=1, A-B = 0
For n=2, A-B = 1
For n=3, A-B = 9
For n=4, A-B = 36
For n=5, A-B = 100
For n=6, A-B = 225

For the problem (n=6), A-B = 225. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern of differences (0, 1, 9, 36, 100, 225), these are squares of triangular numbers: (0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15) squared. The triangular number formula is n(n+1)/2. For n=6, (6*7/2)^2 = 21^2 = 441, but we need to adjust for offset since n=1 gives 0.
