This problem involves calculating the probability that when Robbie and Francine each roll a die (with values 1-6), Robbie's score plus 8 is greater than Francine's score plus 10. We need to enumerate all possible outcomes and count the favorable cases where 8 + r > 10 + f, which simplifies to r > f + 2.

The Python program will:
1. Iterate through all possible die rolls for Robbie (1-6) and Francine (1-6)
2. Count cases where Robbie's roll is at least 3 more than Francine's (since r > f + 2)
3. Calculate the probability as favorable/total cases

```python
def main():
    total = 0
    favorable = 0
    
    for r in range(1, 7):
        for f in range(1, 7):
            total += 1
            if r > f + 2:
                favorable += 1
                print(f"Favorable case: Robbie={r}, Francine={f}")
    
    probability = favorable / total
    print(f"Total cases: {total}")
    print(f"Favorable cases: {favorable}")
    print(f"Probability: {probability}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
