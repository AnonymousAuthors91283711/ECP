This problem involves finding the sum a + c given that a, b, c form a geometric sequence (b = a*r, c = a*r^2) with sum 114 and product 46656. We'll solve it by finding possible values of r and a.

```python
import math

def solve():
    # Given conditions:
    # a + b + c = 114
    # a*b*c = 46656
    # b = a*r, c = a*r^2
    
    # Substitute b and c into sum equation:
    # a + a*r + a*r^2 = 114 => a(1 + r + r^2) = 114
    # Substitute into product equation:
    # a * (a*r) * (a*r^2) = 46656 => a^3 * r^3 = 46656 => (a*r)^3 = 46656
    
    # Let x = a*r, then x^3 = 46656 => x = 36
    x = 36
    
    # Now we have a*r = 36 => a = 36/r
    # Substitute back into sum equation:
    # (36/r)(1 + r + r^2) = 114
    # Multiply both sides by r:
    # 36(1 + r + r^2) = 114r
    # Simplify:
    # 36r^2 - 78r + 36 = 0
    # Divide by 6:
    # 6r^2 - 13r + 6 = 0
    
    # Solve quadratic equation for r:
    discriminant = 13**2 - 4*6*6
    r1 = (13 + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*6)
    r2 = (13 - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*6)
    
    # For each r, compute a and c
    for r in [r1, r2]:
        a = 36 / r
        c = a * r**2
        print(f"Solution: a = {a}, c = {c}, a + c = {a + c}")
    
    # Also consider negative root case (though it might not satisfy original conditions)
    x_neg = -36
    for r in [r1, r2]:
        a = x_neg / r
        c = a * r**2
        print(f"Negative solution: a = {a}, c = {c}, a + c = {a + c}")
