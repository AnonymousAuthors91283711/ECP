Ground Truth Answer: fun _ => 1/12
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n = 1 then 0 else (1 / n)^4 * n - (1 / n)^5 * n
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
- We need to find the maximum value of ∑(x_j^4 - x_j^5) under constraints x_j ≥ 0 and ∑x_j = 1
- The ground truth answer claims the maximum is always 1/12 regardless of n
- The proposed answer gives a piecewise function: 0 for n=1, otherwise n*(1/n)^4 - n*(1/n)^5

Evaluation:
1. For n=1:
- Ground truth: 1/12 ≈ 0.083
- Proposed: 0
- The maximum is actually achieved when x=1, giving 1^4-1^5 = 0, so proposed is correct here

2. For n=2:
- Ground truth: 1/12 ≈ 0.083
- Proposed: 2*(1/2)^4 - 2*(1/2)^5 = 2/16 - 2/32 = 1/8 - 1/16 = 1/16 ≈ 0.0625
- The actual maximum is higher (1/12 ≈ 0.083), achieved when one x_i=1/2+√(1/12), other x_i=1/2-√(1/12)

3. For n≥3:
- The proposed answer gives (n-4)/n^4 which decreases with n
- The ground truth maintains 1/12 as the maximum

Conclusion:
The proposed answer is incorrect for n≥2, as it doesn't match the ground truth maximum value of 1/12. It's only correct for n=1.
