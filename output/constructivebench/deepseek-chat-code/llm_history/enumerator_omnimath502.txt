This problem involves finding the sum of n * θ(n) for n from 0 to 2009 modulo 2010, where θ(n) counts numbers x < 2010 such that 2010 divides x² - n. We'll write a Python program to compute this sum modulo 2010 by:

1. Iterating through each n from 0 to 2009
2. For each n, counting valid x values (x < 2010 where 2010 divides x² - n)
3. Accumulating n * θ(n) modulo 2010
4. Printing intermediate results and the final sum

```python
def compute_sum_mod():
    mod = 2010
    total = 0
    
    for n in range(mod):
        count = 0
        for x in range(mod):
            if (x * x - n) % mod == 0:
                count += 1
        term = n * count
        total = (total + term) % mod
        # Print intermediate results for n and partial sums
        if n % 100 == 0 or n == mod - 1:
            print(f"n={n}, θ(n)={count}, current sum mod {mod}={total}")
    
    print(f"Final sum modulo {mod}: {total}")
