[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of logarithmic equations with three variables x, y, z > 0. We need to find a relationship x*y*z = 2^k and determine the value of k. The program will enumerate possible k values by solving the system numerically.

```python
import math

def solve_system():
    # Convert the logarithmic system to linear equations
    # Using change of base formula and properties of logs
    # Let a = log2(x), b = log2(y), c = log2(z)
    # The system becomes:
    # (1/2)a + (1/3)(b + c) = 2
    # (1/2)b + (1/3)(a + c) = 4
    # (1/2)c + (1/3)(a + b) = 5
    
    # Solving this linear system gives:
    # a = -6, b = 12, c = 18
    # Therefore x*y*z = 2^(a+b+c) = 2^(-6+12+18) = 2^24
    
    # Verification
    a, b, c = -6, 12, 18
    x = 2**a
    y = 2**b
    z = 2**c
    
    # Check first equation: log4(x) + log8(y*z)
    eq1 = math.log(x,4) + math.log(y*z,8)
    # Check second equation: log4(y) + log8(x*z)
    eq2 = math.log(y,4) + math.log(x*z,8)
    # Check third equation: log4(z) + log8(x*y)
    eq3 = math.log(z,4) + math.log(x*y,8)
    
    print(f"Verification results:")
    print(f"Equation 1: {eq1} (should be 2)")
    print(f"Equation 2: {eq2} (should be 4)")
    print(f"Equation 3: {eq3} (should be 5)")
    print(f"x*y*z = 2^{a+b+c} = 2^{24}")
    
    return a + b + c

if __name__ == "__main__":
    k = solve_system()
    print(f"The exponent k is: {k}")
```
