Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | ∃ k, n = 3 * k ∧ k ≥ 1}
Proposed Answer: {n | n % 3 = 0}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer {n | n % 3 = 0} is mostly correct but doesn't explicitly include the constraint n ≥ 3 from the problem statement. The ground truth answer {n : ℕ | ∃ k, n = 3 * k ∧ k ≥ 1} is equivalent to {n | n % 3 = 0 ∧ n ≥ 3} since k ≥ 1 implies n = 3k ≥ 3. The proposed answer would be correct if we assume the context of n ≥ 3 from the problem, but strictly speaking it's missing this explicit constraint.
