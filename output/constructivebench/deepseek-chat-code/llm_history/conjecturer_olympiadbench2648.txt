. Current Proposed Answer: a 1 * (a 2 / a 1) ^ 20. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 1 column 0, which is at "Error" in "Error", there is an error: unexpected identifier; expected command.
. Enumerated Answers: a21 = 1.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the problem statement and given conditions, we can observe:
1. The sequence follows a geometric progression pattern: aₙ = a₁ * (r)^(n-1) where r = a₂/a₁
2. We have two data points: a₂₀ = 8 and a₁₄ = 2²¹
3. We need to find a₂₁

Looking at the enumerated answer (a21 = 1.0), this suggests the final answer should be 1. The error in the proposed answer comes from trying to directly use the recursive formula without solving for the constants.

The correct approach would be to:
1. Solve for r using the two given points
2. Then compute a₂₁ using the found r

Here's the corrected answer in Lean:

<<<1>>> 

Explanation:
- From a₁₄ = a₁ * r¹³ = 2²¹
- From a₂₀ = a₁ * r¹⁹ = 8 = 2³
- Dividing gives r⁶ = 2⁻¹⁸ ⇒ r = 2⁻³
- Then a₂₁ = a₂₀ * r = 8 * 2⁻³ = 1[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

. Enumerated Answers: a21 = 1.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the problem statement and the enumerated answer, we can deduce the following:

1. The sequence a follows a geometric progression pattern as shown in the hypothesis `ha`.
2. Given a20 = 8 and a14 = 2^21, we can solve for the common ratio and first term.
3. The enumerated answer suggests a21 = 1.0, which gives us a hint about the final value.

The error in the proposed answer was likely due to incorrect syntax or missing definitions. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<1>>> 

Explanation:
1. From the geometric sequence formula `a n = a1 * (r)^(n-1)` where r = a2/a1
2. Using a14 = 2^21 and a20 = 8, we can set up equations:
   - a14 = a1 * r^13 = 2^21
   - a20 = a1 * r^19 = 8
3. Dividing these gives r^6 = 8/2^21 = 2^-18 → r = 2^-3
4. Substituting back gives a1 = 2^21 / (2^-3)^13 = 2^21 * 2^39 = 2^60
5. Then a21 = a1 * r^20 = 2^60 * (2^-3)^20 = 2^60 * 2^-60 = 1

Thus, the correct answer is 1.0 (represented as 1 in Lean).[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
