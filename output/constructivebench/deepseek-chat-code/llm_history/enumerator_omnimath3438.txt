[write_program]
This problem is a simple arithmetic calculation that can be solved directly. The expression sums five terms of `5 * 5`, which is equivalent to `5 * (5 * 5) = 5 * 25 = 125`. We'll write a Python program that calculates this value directly.

```python
# Calculate the sum of five 5*5 terms
result = 5 * 5 + 5 * 5 + 5 * 5 + 5 * 5 + 5 * 5
print(result)
```
