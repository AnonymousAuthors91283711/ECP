This problem asks for the largest natural number n such that n^200 < 3^500. We can simplify the inequality by taking natural logarithms and solving for n. The equivalent condition is n < 3^(500/200) = 3^(5/2) ≈ 3^2.5 ≈ 15.588. Therefore, we expect the answer to be 15.

The Python program will verify this by checking numbers around this estimate, starting from the highest possible candidates and working downwards until finding the largest valid n.

```python
def main():
    # Calculate the right-hand side value once
    rhs = 3 ** 500
    
    # Start checking from a reasonable upper bound (we know it must be <=15 from estimation)
    for n in range(16, 0, -1):
        if n ** 200 < rhs:
            print(f"Found valid n: {n}")
            print(f"Maximum n satisfying n^200 < 3^500 is: {n}")
            return
    
    print("No valid n found (unexpected)")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
