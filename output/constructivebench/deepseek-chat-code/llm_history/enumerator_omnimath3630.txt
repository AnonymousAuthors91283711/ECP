[write_program]
This problem asks to find all 4-element sets of natural numbers {a,b,c,d} where all three combinations (a*b + c*d), (a*c + b*d), and (a*d + b*c) are prime numbers. We'll write a Python program to enumerate such sets.

The approach:
1. Iterate through all possible 4-element combinations of numbers up to a reasonable threshold
2. For each combination, check if all three required sums are prime
3. Print valid sets as they're found
4. Since the problem states there are exactly 4 elements in the answer set, we'll stop after finding all unique sets up to our threshold

```python
import itertools
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]:
        if n % p == 0:
            return n == p
    d = n - 1
    s = 0
    while d % 2 == 0:
        d //= 2
        s += 1
    for a in [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]:
        if a >= n:
            continue
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(s - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False
    return True

max_num = 20  # Reasonable threshold based on problem constraints
seen = set()

print("Searching for 4-element sets where all combinations are prime...")
for nums in itertools.combinations(range(1, max_num + 1), 4):
    a, b, c, d = nums
    # Check all three required combinations
    ab_cd = a*b + c*d
    ac_bd = a*c + b*d
    ad_bc = a*d + b*c
    if all(is_prime(x) for x in [ab_cd, ac_bd, ad_bc]):
        sorted_nums = tuple(sorted(nums))
        if sorted_nums not in seen:
            seen.add(sorted_nums)
            print(f"Found valid set: {sorted_nums}")

print("\nSearch complete.")
