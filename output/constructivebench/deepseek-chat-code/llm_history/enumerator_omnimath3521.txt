[write_program]
This problem appears to be about finding pairs of distinct numbers from a set S that sum to a given number n. The function r(S,n) counts such pairs. The Lean code shows this is an unsolved problem (marked with `sorry`). 

To help conjecture properties about r(S,n), we'll write a Python program that:
1. Takes small sample sets S (like subsets of {1,2,...,10})
2. For each n, counts the number of distinct pairs in S that sum to n
3. Prints the results for analysis

The program will help observe patterns in how r(S,n) behaves for different S and n.

```python
def count_sum_pairs(S, max_n):
    """Count pairs (a,b) in S with a < b and a+b = n for each n up to max_n"""
    S = sorted(S)
    counts = {}
    # Initialize counts for all possible n
    for n in range(2, max_n + 1):
        counts[n] = 0
    
    # Count all valid pairs
    for i in range(len(S)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(S)):
            s = S[i] + S[j]
            if s <= max_n:
                counts[s] += 1
    return counts

# Sample sets to analyze
sample_sets = [
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5},
    {2, 4, 6, 8},
    {1, 3, 5, 7, 9},
    {1, 2, 4, 8},
    {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}
]

max_n = 20  # Maximum sum to consider

for S in sample_sets:
    print(f"\nSet S = {sorted(S)}")
    counts = count_sum_pairs(S, max_n)
    for n in range(2, max_n + 1):
        if counts[n] > 0:
            print(f"r(S, {n}) = {counts[n]}")
```
