Ground Truth Answer: {2, 3} ∪ {a | ∃ n, a = ofDigits 10 (replicate (n + 1) 2 ++ [1])}
Proposed Answer: {a | ∃ k : ℕ, a = 2 * 10^k + 2 * (∑ i ∈ Finset.range k, 10^i) + 1}
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth describes numbers that are either 2, 3, or numbers consisting of (n+1) twos followed by a one (like 21, 221, 2221, etc.).

The proposed answer uses a formula that can be simplified as:
2*10^k + 2*(sum of 10^i for i from 0 to k-1) + 1
= 2*10^k + 2*( (10^k - 1)/9 ) + 1
= (20*10^k - 2)/9 + 1
= (20*10^k + 7)/9

This generates numbers like:
For k=0: (20+7)/9 = 3
For k=1: (200+7)/9 = 23 (but should be 21)
For k=2: (2000+7)/9 = 223 (but should be 221)

The proposed answer correctly includes 3 (k=0 case), but fails to match the pattern for k≥1 cases (it's off by 2 each time). It also misses the number 2 from the ground truth.
