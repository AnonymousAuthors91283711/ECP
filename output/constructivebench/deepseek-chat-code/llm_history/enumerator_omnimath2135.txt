This problem asks for the number of 5-tuples of integers between 1 and 5 (inclusive) where:
1. All elements are distinct (no three elements are equal)
2. No three elements form an arithmetic progression (for any three distinct indices)

We'll enumerate all possible 5-tuples meeting these conditions. Since the range is small (1-5), we can brute-force all permutations.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def has_arithmetic_progression(t):
    # Check all triples for arithmetic progression
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(i+1, 4):
            for k in range(j+1, 5):
                a, b, c = t[i], t[j], t[k]
                if (a + c == 2*b) or (a + b == 2*c) or (b + c == 2*a):
                    return True
    return False

count = 0
for p in permutations(range(1, 6)):  # All permutations of 1-5
    if not has_arithmetic_progression(p):
        count += 1
        print(p)  # Stream found tuples

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
