This problem involves simplifying a ratio of exponential terms with large exponents (2012 and 2014). The key insight is to factor out common terms and simplify the expression algebraically. We'll write a program to verify the simplified form for smaller exponents first, building confidence in the general pattern.

The approach is:
1. Factor out 2^2012 from both numerator and denominator
2. Simplify the resulting expression
3. Verify the pattern holds for smaller exponents

```python
def simplify_ratio(k):
    """Simplifies (2^(k+2) + 2^k) / (2^(k+2) - 2^k)) for any k"""
    numerator = 2**(k+2) + 2**k
    denominator = 2**(k+2) - 2**k
    # Factor out 2^k from both terms
    simplified_num = 2**k * (2**2 + 1)
    simplified_den = 2**k * (2**2 - 1)
    # The 2^k terms cancel out
    return (simplified_num // 2**k) / (simplified_den // 2**k)

# Test the pattern for smaller exponents
for k in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 100]:
    exact_value = simplify_ratio(k)
    print(f"For k={k}, simplified ratio: {exact_value}")

# The general solution would be (2^2 + 1)/(2^2 - 1) = 5/3 for any k
# For the original problem with k=2012:
print("\nThe simplified form for any k is always:", simplify_ratio(2012))
```
