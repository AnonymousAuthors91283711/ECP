[write_program]
This problem asks to find all triples (x, y, p) where p is prime and x, y are positive integers satisfying x続 + y続 = p(xy + p). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible solutions for small primes and small x, y values.

The approach:
1. Iterate through small prime numbers p
2. For each p, iterate through possible x and y values up to a reasonable limit
3. Check if the equation x続 + y続 == p*(x*y + p) holds
4. Print valid triples as they're found

```python
import sympy

def find_solutions(max_p=100, max_xy=1000):
    """Find solutions to x^3 + y^3 = p(xy + p) for primes p <= max_p and x,y <= max_xy"""
    for p in sympy.primerange(2, max_p + 1):
        for x in range(1, max_xy + 1):
            # Since equation is symmetric in x and y, we can assume x <= y to avoid duplicates
            for y in range(x, max_xy + 1):
                lhs = x**3 + y**3
                rhs = p * (x * y + p)
                if lhs == rhs:
                    print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}, p={p}")
                elif lhs > rhs:
                    # Since x^3 + y^3 grows faster than RHS, we can break early
                    break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Searching for solutions to x^3 + y^3 = p(xy + p)...")
    find_solutions()
```
