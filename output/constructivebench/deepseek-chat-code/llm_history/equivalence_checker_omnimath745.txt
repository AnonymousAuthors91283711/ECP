abbrev omnimath745_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath745 :
  (∑ a in range 81, ∑ b in range 81, if b ≤ a then (choose a b : ZMod 3).val else 0) / (81 * 81) = omnimath745_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1816 / 6561
Proposed Answer: 2/3 - 2 / (3 * 81)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves summing binomial coefficients modulo 3 over a specific range and then normalizing by 81×81.

2. The ground truth answer is 1816/6561 ≈ 0.2767

3. The proposed answer is 2/3 - 2/(3×81) = 160/243 ≈ 0.6584

The two answers are numerically very different (0.2767 vs 0.6584), so they cannot be equivalent.
