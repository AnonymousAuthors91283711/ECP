Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 2 * n - 1
Proposed Answer: fun n => n + 1
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

The problem is about finding the maximum size m of a set Sm with certain combinatorial properties related to finite set configurations. The conditions describe a system where:
- Sm has cardinality m*n
- There are 2*n subsets of size m (each subset of Sm)
- Any two distinct subsets intersect in at most 1 element
- Each element of Sm appears in exactly 2 subsets

This resembles a finite projective plane configuration where:
- Points = elements of Sm
- Lines = subsets in T
- Each line has m points
- Each point lies on exactly 2 lines
- Any two lines intersect in at most 1 point

For such configurations, the ground truth answer 2n-1 makes sense because:
- In projective planes, the number of points is related to the order of the plane
- The given conditions suggest a configuration that would require m = 2n-1 to satisfy all constraints

The proposed answer n+1 is too small and doesn't satisfy the combinatorial requirements. For example:
- When n=2, ground truth gives 3 while proposed gives 3 (accidentally matches)
- When n=3, ground truth gives 5 while proposed gives 4 (diverges)
- The proposed answer doesn't account for all the intersection constraints
