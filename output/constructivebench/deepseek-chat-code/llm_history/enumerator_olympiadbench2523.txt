[write_program]
This problem asks to find all real pairs (x,y) that satisfy two equations:
1. x*(1/2 + y - 2x²) = 0
2. y*(5/2 + x - y) = 0

We'll enumerate all possible combinations where either factor in each product is zero. The program will systematically check all cases and print the solutions.

```python
def find_solutions():
    # Case 1: x = 0
    x = 0.0
    # Subcase 1.1: y = 0
    y = 0.0
    print(f"Solution: ({x}, {y})")
    # Subcase 1.2: 5/2 + x - y = 0 => y = 5/2 + x
    y = 5/2 + x
    print(f"Solution: ({x}, {y})")
    
    # Case 2: 1/2 + y - 2x² = 0 => y = 2x² - 1/2
    # Subcase 2.1: y = 0
    # Solve 2x² - 1/2 = 0 => x = ±1/2
    x = 0.5
    y = 0.0
    print(f"Solution: ({x}, {y})")
    x = -0.5
    print(f"Solution: ({x}, {y})")
    # Subcase 2.2: 5/2 + x - y = 0 => 5/2 + x - (2x² - 1/2) = 0 => -2x² + x + 3 = 0
    # Solutions: x = [1 ± √(1+24)]/-4 => x = -1 or x = 1.5
    x = -1.0
    y = 2*x*x - 0.5
    print(f"Solution: ({x}, {y})")
    x = 1.5
    y = 2*x*x - 0.5
    print(f"Solution: ({x}, {y})")

find_solutions()
