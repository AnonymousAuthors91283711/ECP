Based on the problem statement, we're calculating the probability that in a random permutation of 25 people, Charlie is adjacent to either Chris or Abby in the permutation order. The probability should be the same for any two fixed positions, so we can generalize the solution.

<<<2 / 25>>> 

Explanation: For any two specific people, the probability that they are adjacent in a random permutation of n people is 2/n (since they can be ordered either way). Here n=25 and we have two possible pairs (Charlie-Chris and Charlie-Abby), but we must subtract the overlap where Charlie is adjacent to both, which becomes negligible for large n. The exact answer is (2*24!*2)/25! = 2/25.
