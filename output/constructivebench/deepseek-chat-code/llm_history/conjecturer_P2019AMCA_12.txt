Based on the problem statement and error message, I'll propose a corrected answer. The error indicates we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it depends on Real.logb. The problem involves logarithmic identities and solving for x and y given the constraints. From the conditions:
1. logb 2 x = logb y 16 implies x = 2^(logb y 16)
2. Combined with x*y=64, we can derive that x=16 and y=4 (or vice versa) is a solution
3. Thus logb 2 (x/y) = logb 2 (16/4) = logb 2 4 = 2
4. Squaring gives the final answer 4

Here's the corrected Lean answer:
<<<noncomputable abbrev P2019AMCA_12_answer : ℝ := 4>>> 

The key steps are:
1. Using logarithmic identities to relate x and y
2. Solving the system of equations
3. Evaluating the final logarithmic expression
4. Marking as noncomputable due to Real.logb dependency[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem, we need to find the value of (log₂(x/y))² given the conditions about x and y. The key steps would involve:

1. Using the logarithmic identity from h1: log₂x = log_y16
2. Converting this to exponential form: y^(log₂x) = 16
3. Taking log₂ of both sides: (log₂x)(log₂y) = 4
4. From h2: x*y = 64 ⇒ log₂x + log₂y = 6
5. Let a = log₂x, b = log₂y, then we have:
   - a*b = 4
   - a + b = 6
6. Solving gives a quadratic equation with solutions 3±√5
7. Then (log₂(x/y))² = (a - b)² = (a + b)² - 4ab = 36 - 16 = 20

The correct answer should be 20. Here's the fixed Lean expression:

<<<20>>>
