[write_program]
This problem involves finding the value of x (0 < x < 0.1) where two infinite series are equal. The first series is a geometric series, while the second is a modified version with coefficients growing exponentially. We'll write a program to numerically approximate the solution by evaluating both series for different x values in the range and finding where they are approximately equal.

```python
def fouryseries(x, terms=100):
    """Approximate the fouryseries sum with finite terms"""
    return sum(4 * x**n for n in range(terms))

def fourierseries(x, terms=100):
    """Approximate the fourierseries sum with finite terms"""
    return sum(4 * (10**n) * x**n for n in range(terms))

def find_x():
    """Find x where fourierseries(x) ≈ 4*fouryseries(x) in (0, 0.1)"""
    left = 0.0001
    right = 0.0999
    epsilon = 1e-10
    max_iter = 100
    
    for _ in range(max_iter):
        mid = (left + right) / 2
        f_val = fourierseries(mid)
        g_val = 4 * fouryseries(mid)
        
        if abs(f_val - g_val) < epsilon:
            print(f"Found approximate solution: x ≈ {mid}")
            return mid
        elif f_val > g_val:
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid
    
    print(f"Best approximation after {max_iter} iterations: x ≈ {(left + right)/2}")
    return (left + right)/2

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_x()
```

The program uses binary search to find the x value where the two series are equal within a small epsilon. It evaluates partial sums of both series (100 terms each) to approximate the infinite sums. The solution converges quickly to the value where the equality holds. The output shows the approximate solution found through this numerical method.
