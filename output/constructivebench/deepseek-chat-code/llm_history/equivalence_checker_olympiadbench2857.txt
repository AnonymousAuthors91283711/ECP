Ground Truth Answer: fun T => (T + 1) * T^4 - (T + 1) * T - (T + 1) * choose T 2 * (2 * T^3 - 3 * T^2 + T)
Proposed Answer: fun T : ℕ => (T + 1) * (T^4 - 4*T^3 + 6*T^2 - 3*T)
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. First, let's expand the proposed answer:
   (T+1)*(T^4 - 4T^3 + 6T^2 - 3T) = (T+1)*T^4 - 4(T+1)*T^3 + 6(T+1)*T^2 - 3(T+1)*T

2. Now let's expand the ground truth answer:
   (T+1)*T^4 - (T+1)*T - (T+1)*T*(T-1)/2*(2T^3-3T^2+T)
   = (T+1)*T^4 - (T+1)*T - (T+1)*T*(T-1)*(2T^3-3T^2+T)/2

3. The binomial coefficient choose T 2 = T*(T-1)/2 was used in the ground truth.

4. Let's expand the last term of ground truth:
   (T+1)*T*(T-1)*(2T^3-3T^2+T)/2
   = (T+1)*T*(2T^4 - 5T^3 + 4T^2 - T)/2
   = (T+1)*(T^5 - 2.5T^4 + 2T^3 - 0.5T^2)

5. Comparing coefficients:
   - For T^5: Ground truth has -(T+1)*1, proposed has 0
   - For T^4: Ground truth has -(T+1)*(-2.5), proposed has -4(T+1)
   - For T^3: Ground truth has (T+1)*2, proposed has 6(T+1)
   - For T^2: Ground truth has -(T+1)*0.5, proposed has 6(T+1)
   - For T: Ground truth has -(T+1)*1 - 0, proposed has -3(T+1)

The coefficients don't match, and the ground truth has a T^5 term while the proposed answer doesn't. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
