[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of real solutions x in the interval [0, π] that satisfy the equation sin(π/2 * cos x) = cos(π/2 * sin x). We'll write a Python program to numerically find and count these solutions.

Approach:
1. We'll sample points in [0, π] and check where the equation holds approximately
2. To avoid missing solutions, we'll look for sign changes in the difference between both sides
3. We'll use a fine enough grid to detect all solutions while being computationally efficient

```python
import numpy as np
from math import pi, sin, cos

def f(x):
    """Difference between left and right sides of the equation"""
    return sin(pi/2 * cos(x)) - cos(pi/2 * sin(x))

# Search interval [0, pi] with sufficient resolution
a, b = 0, pi
n_points = 10000  # High enough to catch all roots
xs = np.linspace(a, b, n_points)
ys = [f(x) for x in xs]

# Find approximate roots by detecting sign changes
roots = []
for i in range(len(xs)-1):
    if ys[i] * ys[i+1] <= 0:  # Sign change or zero
        # Refine using linear approximation
        x0, x1 = xs[i], xs[i+1]
        y0, y1 = ys[i], ys[i+1]
        if y0 == 0:
            root = x0
        else:
            root = x0 - y0 * (x1 - x0)/(y1 - y0)
        roots.append(root)
        print(f"Found root at x ≈ {root:.5f}")

# Remove duplicates (due to multiple nearby points hitting same root)
unique_roots = []
tolerance = 1e-6
for root in sorted(roots):
    if not unique_roots or abs(root - unique_roots[-1]) > tolerance:
        unique_roots.append(root)

print(f"\nTotal distinct roots found: {len(unique_roots)}")
```
