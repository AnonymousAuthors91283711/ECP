abbrev IMO2013SLN6_answer : Set (ℚ → ℤ) := sorry
theorem IMO2013SLN6 (f : ℚ → ℤ) :
  (∀ x a b, b > 0 → f (f x + a / b) = f (-x + a / b)) ↔ f ∈ IMO2013SLN6_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing constant functions:
f(x) = -2 works
f(x) = -1 works
f(x) = 0 works
f(x) = 1 works
f(x) = 2 works

Testing linear functions:
f(x) = 0x + -2 works
f(x) = 0x + -1 works
f(x) = 0x + 0 works
f(x) = 0x + 1 works
f(x) = 0x + 2 works

Testing piecewise functions:. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℚ → ℤ)
From the enumerated answers, we observe that all constant functions satisfy the given condition. The condition holds because for any constant function f(x) = c, both sides of the equation reduce to c = c regardless of the input. The linear functions shown are actually constant functions (slope 0). No other patterns were found in the enumeration.
