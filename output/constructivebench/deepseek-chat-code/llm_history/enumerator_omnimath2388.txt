[write_program]
This problem involves counting the number of Hamiltonian paths on a 4×4 grid that start and end at (0,0), visit every other point exactly once, and move only between adjacent points (up, down, left, right). We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such paths.

The approach:
1. Represent the grid as coordinates (0-3)×(0-3)
2. Use backtracking to explore all possible paths
3. Track visited points and ensure all are visited exactly once (except (0,0) which is visited twice)
4. Count only paths that return to (0,0) at step 15

```python
def count_hamiltonian_paths():
    grid_size = 4
    target_length = 16
    start = (0, 0)
    count = 0
    
    def backtrack(path):
        nonlocal count
        if len(path) == target_length:
            if path[-1] == start:
                count += 1
                print(f"Found path #{count}")
            return
        
        last = path[-1]
        for dx, dy in [(0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0)]:
            x, y = last[0] + dx, last[1] + dy
            if 0 <= x < grid_size and 0 <= y < grid_size:
                if (x, y) == start and len(path) != target_length - 1:
                    continue  # can only return to start at the end
                if (x, y) in path and (x, y) != start:
                    continue  # already visited (except start)
                backtrack(path + [(x, y)])
    
    backtrack([start])
    print(f"Total number of paths: {count}")

count_hamiltonian_paths()
```

Note: This program will take a long time to run for the full 4×4 grid due to the combinatorial complexity. For demonstration purposes, you might want to test it first with smaller grid sizes (e.g., 2×2 or 3×3) by adjusting the grid_size variable. The program will print each valid path as it's found and finally output the total count.
