This problem involves finding all real polynomials P that satisfy a given functional equation. We'll approach it by testing polynomial candidates of increasing degrees, evaluating the condition on sample values to filter potential solutions.

The strategy is:
1. Test constant polynomials (degree 0)
2. Test linear polynomials (degree 1)
3. Test quadratic polynomials (degree 2)
4. Verify the condition holds for each candidate

We'll use small non-zero x,y,z values satisfying 2xyz = x+y+z to test the condition.

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.polynomial.polynomial import Polynomial

def test_polynomial(P):
    # Test cases where 2xyz = x+y+z
    test_cases = [
        (1, 1, 1),  # Doesn't satisfy 2xyz=x+y+z
        (1, 2, -3),  # 2*1*2*(-3)=-12, 1+2-3=0 → doesn't satisfy
        (1, 1, 0.5), # 2*1*1*0.5=1, 1+1+0.5=2.5 → doesn't satisfy
        (1, 2, 3/10), # 2*1*2*0.3=1.2, 1+2+0.3=3.3 → doesn't satisfy
        (1, -1, 1/2), # 2*1*(-1)*0.5=-1, 1-1+0.5=0.5 → doesn't satisfy
        (1, 1/2, -2/3) # 2*1*0.5*(-2/3)=-2/3, 1+0.5-0.666...≈0.833 → doesn't satisfy
    ]

                    valid_cases.append((x,y,z))
    
    if not valid_cases:
        return False
    
    for x,y,z in valid_cases:
        left = P(x)/(y*z) + P(y)/(z*x) + P(z)/(x*y)
        right = P(x-y) + P(y-z) + P(z-x)
        if abs(left - right) > 1e-6:
            return False
    return True
