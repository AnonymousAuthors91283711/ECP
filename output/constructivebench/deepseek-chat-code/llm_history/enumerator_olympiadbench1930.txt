[write_program]
This problem asks to find all positive integer triples (a,b,c) such that a³ + b³ + c³ = (abc)². We'll write a Python program to search for such triples up to a reasonable limit.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible values of a, b, c up to a threshold (we'll use 100)
2. For each combination, check if the equation holds
3. Print valid triples as they're found
4. Since the problem doesn't specify ordering, we'll assume a ≤ b ≤ c to avoid duplicates

```python
def find_triples(max_n=100):
    found = set()
    for a in range(1, max_n + 1):
        for b in range(a, max_n + 1):
            # Calculate c³ = (abc)² - a³ - b³
            # We need c³ to be positive and a perfect cube
            rhs = (a * b)**2
            sum_ab = a**3 + b**3
            # Solve c³ = rhs*c² - sum_ab => c³ - rhs*c² + sum_ab = 0
            # Try all c from b to max_n
            for c in range(b, max_n + 1):
                if a**3 + b**3 + c**3 == (a * b * c)**2:
                    # Store sorted tuple to avoid duplicates
                    triple = tuple(sorted((a, b, c)))
                    if triple not in found:
                        found.add(triple)
                        print(triple)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Searching for triples (a,b,c) where a³ + b³ + c³ = (abc)²")
    find_triples()
```
