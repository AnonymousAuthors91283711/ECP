This problem asks for the maximum possible value of f(2019) for functions f: ℤ → ℤ satisfying:
1. f(0) = 0
2. |f((n+1)*2^k) - f(n*2^k)| ≤ 1 for all integers n and natural numbers k

We'll write a program to compute the maximum f(2019) by considering the binary representation of 2019 and tracking the possible function values at each power of 2.

```python
def max_f_value(n):
    binary = bin(n)[2:]  # Get binary representation without '0b' prefix
    max_val = 0
    min_val = 0
    current = 0
    
    for bit in binary:
        if bit == '1':
            # When we see a 1, we can either increase or decrease by 1
            new_max = max(max_val + 1, min_val + 1)
            new_min = min(max_val - 1, min_val - 1)
            max_val, min_val = new_max, new_min
            current += 1
        else:
            # For 0, we maintain the same range
            pass
    
    return max_val

# Compute for n=2019
n = 2019
print(f"Maximum f({n}) is {max_f_value(n)}")
```

The program works by:
1. Converting the number to binary
2. Tracking the maximum and minimum possible function values as we process each bit
3. For each '1' bit, we expand the possible range by ±1
4. The final maximum value is the answer

For n=2019 (binary 11111100011), the output shows the maximum possible value.
