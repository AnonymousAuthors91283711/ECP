[write_program]
This problem involves proving an inequality for positive real sequences and determining for which natural numbers n the inequality holds. We'll write a Python program to test small values of n to help conjecture the answer.

The inequality is:
(∑a_i²)(∑a_i) - ∑a_i³ ≥ 6∏a_i for all positive real sequences a_i

We'll test n=1,2,3,... and check if the inequality holds for various test cases of a_i sequences. For each n, we'll try multiple random positive sequences to get empirical evidence.

```python
import random
import math

def test_inequality(n, num_tests=1000):
    """Test the inequality for n with random positive sequences."""
    for _ in range(num_tests):
        # Generate random positive numbers
        a = [random.uniform(0.1, 10.0) for _ in range(n)]
        
        sum_a = sum(a)
        sum_a2 = sum(x*x for x in a)
        sum_a3 = sum(x**3 for x in a)
        product_a = math.prod(a)
        
        lhs = sum_a2 * sum_a - sum_a3
        rhs = 6 * product_a
        
        if lhs < rhs - 1e-10:  # Account for floating point errors
            return False
    return True

def main():
    max_n = 10  # Test up to n=10
    valid_n = []
    
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        if test_inequality(n):
            valid_n.append(n)
            print(f"n = {n} appears to satisfy the inequality")
    
    print("\nBased on testing, possible values of n where the inequality holds:")
    print(valid_n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
