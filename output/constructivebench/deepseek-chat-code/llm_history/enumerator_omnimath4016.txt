[write_program]
This problem asks for all 3-digit numbers (100-999) where the number plus its reverse equals a perfect square. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such numbers and check the condition.

The approach:
1. Iterate through all 3-digit numbers (100-999)
2. For each number, compute its reverse
3. Check if the sum of the number and its reverse is a perfect square
4. Print numbers that satisfy the condition

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(num):
    root = math.isqrt(num)
    return root * root == num

def reverse_number(n):
    return (n % 10) * 100 + (n // 10 % 10) * 10 + n // 100

for n in range(100, 1000):
    reversed_n = reverse_number(n)
    total = n + reversed_n
    if is_perfect_square(total):
        print(n)
```
