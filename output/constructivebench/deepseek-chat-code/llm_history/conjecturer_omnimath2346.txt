theorem omnimath2346 :
  let Ω := powerset (univ : Finset (Fin 8))
  let initial_collection := Ω.erase ∅
  let expected_size := (∑ s in initial_collection, s.card) / initial_collection.card
  expected_size = omnimath2346_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: For n=8, expected subset size = 4.015686274509804
Exact fraction: 1024/255 = 4.015686274509804. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<1024 / 255>>>
