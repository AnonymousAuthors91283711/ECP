The problem is to find the greatest rational number in the set {3/10, 4/7, 5/23, 2/3, 1/2}. We can solve this by comparing all fractions in the list and finding the maximum value.

Here's a Python program that enumerates all fractions, converts them to floats for comparison, and finds the maximum value:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def find_greatest_fraction():
    fractions = [
        Fraction(3, 10),
        Fraction(4, 7),
        Fraction(5, 23),
        Fraction(2, 3),
        Fraction(1, 2)
    ]
    
    # Print all fractions with their decimal values
    for f in fractions:
        print(f"{f} = {float(f)}")
    
    # Find and print the greatest fraction
    greatest = max(fractions)
    print(f"\nThe greatest fraction is: {greatest}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_greatest_fraction()
```

The program first lists all fractions with their decimal equivalents, then explicitly outputs the greatest fraction found. The output will show that 2/3 is the largest value in the set.
