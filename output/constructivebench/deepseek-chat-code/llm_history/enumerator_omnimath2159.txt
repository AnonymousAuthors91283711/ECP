This problem involves finding the minimal number of colors needed to properly color a graph (with adjacency defined by ±1 mod 9) under certain constraints, and then counting the number of such colorings. The graph is a cycle of 9 vertices with additional constraints on triangle colorings.

We'll approach this by:
1. Modeling the graph as a 9-cycle
2. Implementing the adjacency and triangle constraints
3. Finding the minimal number of colors that satisfies all constraints
4. Counting valid colorings for that minimal number

```python
from itertools import product, combinations

def main():
    V = 9  # vertices 0-8
    # Adjacency: v and w are adjacent if |v-w| ≡ 1 mod 9
    def adjacent(v, w):
        return (v - w) % 9 in (1, 8)
    
    # All possible triangles (3-cliques where all differences ≡ 0 mod 3)
    triangles = []
    for t in combinations(range(V), 3):
        a, b, c = t
        if (a - b) % 3 == 0 and (b - c) % 3 == 0:
            triangles.append(t)
    
    # Find minimal k with at least one valid coloring
    for k in range(1, 6):
        found = False
        # Try all possible colorings with k colors
        for coloring in product(range(k), repeat=V):
            valid = True
            # Check adjacency constraint
            for v in range(V):
                w = (v + 1) % V
                if coloring[v] == coloring[w]:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                continue
            
            # Check triangle constraint
            for t in triangles:
                colors = [coloring[v] for v in t]
                if len(set(colors)) != 3:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                found = True
                break
        
        if found:
            m = k
            print(f"Found minimal colors m = {m}")
            break
    
    # Now count all valid colorings for m colors
    count = 0
    for coloring in product(range(m), repeat=V):
        valid = True
        # Check adjacency constraint
        for v in range(V):
            w = (v + 1) % V
            if coloring[v] == coloring[w]:
                valid = False
                break
        if not valid:
            continue
        
        # Check triangle constraint
        for t in triangles:
            colors = [coloring[v] for v in t]
            if len(set(colors)) != 3:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1
    
    print(f"Number of valid colorings n = {count}")
    print(f"Final answer m*n = {m * count}")
