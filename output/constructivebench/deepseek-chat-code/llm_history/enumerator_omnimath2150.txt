This problem asks for the largest 4-digit number whose digits are a permutation of [2,0,1,9] and is divisible by 7. We'll enumerate all permutations of these digits that form valid 4-digit numbers (can't start with 0) and check divisibility by 7.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def solve():
    digits = ['2', '0', '1', '9']
    candidates = set()
    
    for p in permutations(digits):
        if p[0] == '0':  # Skip numbers starting with 0
            continue
        num = int(''.join(p))
        if num % 7 == 0:
            candidates.add(num)
            print(num)  # Stream partial results
    
    if candidates:
        print("Maximum valid number:", max(candidates))
    else:
        print("No valid numbers found")

solve()
```
