noncomputable abbrev P2015AMCA_1_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2015AMCA_1 :
  (5 * ((2^0 - 1 + 5^2 - 0)^(-1 : ℝ)) = P2015AMCA_1_answer) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1/5
Proposed Answer: 1 / 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a mathematical expression: 5 * ((2^0 - 1 + 5^2 - 0)^(-1 : ℝ))
2. Let's simplify the expression step by step:
   - 2^0 = 1
   - 5^2 = 25
   - So the denominator becomes: (1 - 1 + 25 - 0) = 25
   - The exponent -1 means taking the reciprocal, so we get 1/25
   - Then multiplied by 5 gives: 5 * (1/25) = 5/25 = 1/5

3. The ground truth answer is 1/5
4. The proposed answer is 1 / 5 (which is mathematically identical to 1/5)

The two answers are mathematically equivalent, just written with slightly different spacing.
