Ground Truth Answer: 5 * (4 : ℝ) ^ (1/3)
Proposed Answer: -5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the product x*y of two distinct real roots that satisfy two different cubic equations.

2. The ground truth answer is 5 * (4)^(1/3), which is approximately 7.937.

3. The proposed answer is -5, which is significantly different in both magnitude and sign.

4. To verify, let's consider the equations:
   - From x³ + A*x + 10 = 0 and y³ + A*y + 10 = 0, we can derive that x and y are roots of this cubic.
   - From x³ + B*x² + 50 = 0 and y³ + B*y² + 50 = 0, we can derive another relationship.
   - The product x*y would need to satisfy both sets of conditions.

5. The proposed answer of -5 doesn't match the ground truth answer mathematically, and there's no obvious transformation that would make them equivalent.
