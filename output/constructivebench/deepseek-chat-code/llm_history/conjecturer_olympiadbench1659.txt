theorem olympiadbench1659 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hpos : ∀ x > 0, f x > 0) :
  (∀ x > 0, ∀ y > 0, f (x + f y) = f (x + y) + f y) ↔ f = olympiadbench1659_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing linear functions f(x) = kx + c:
Found candidate: f(x) = 2x + 0

Testing power functions f(x) = kx^a:
Found candidate: f(x) = 2x^1

Testing constant functions (shouldn't satisfy hpos):. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
From the enumerated answers and the functional equation, the only solution that satisfies all conditions is the linear function f(x) = 2x. The constant term must be zero to satisfy both the functional equation and positivity condition.
