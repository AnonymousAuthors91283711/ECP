[write_program]
This problem asks to find all natural numbers n for which there exists a permutation of [0..n-1] where the partial sums modulo n are all distinct. We'll write a Python program to enumerate such numbers by checking permutations for small n values.

The key observation is that for such a permutation to exist, the partial sums modulo n must cover all residues 0 through n-1 exactly once. We'll implement this check efficiently by:
1. Generating permutations of range(n)
2. Computing partial sums modulo n
3. Checking if all residues are distinct

```python
import itertools

def check_permutation(n, perm):
    seen = set()
    current_sum = 0
    for num in perm:
        current_sum += num
        mod = current_sum % n
        if mod in seen:
            return False
        seen.add(mod)
    return len(seen) == n

def find_valid_n(max_n=10):
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        print(f"Checking n = {n}")
        found = False
        for perm in itertools.permutations(range(n)):
            if check_permutation(n, perm):
                print(f"Found valid permutation for n={n}: {perm}")
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            print(f"No valid permutation found for n={n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_valid_n()
```

The program checks numbers from 1 to 10 (adjustable via max_n parameter) and prints whether a valid permutation exists for each n. For each valid n, it shows one example permutation that satisfies the condition. The output helps identify which numbers belong to the set omnimath4054_answer.

Note that for larger n, the permutation space grows factorially, so we limit the check to small values. The program can be extended to larger n with more efficient algorithms or mathematical insights.
