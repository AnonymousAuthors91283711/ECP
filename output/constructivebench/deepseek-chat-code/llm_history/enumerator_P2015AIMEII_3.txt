[write_program]
The problem asks for the smallest positive integer m that is divisible by 17 and has a digit sum of 17. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal m by:

1. Generating numbers divisible by 17 in increasing order
2. Checking their digit sums
3. Outputting candidates that meet the criteria
4. Finally printing the smallest found

The program will efficiently generate multiples of 17 and check their digit sums, stopping when the first valid number is found.

```python
def find_min_m():
    m = 17  # Start with the smallest multiple of 17
    while True:
        digit_sum = sum(int(d) for d in str(m))
        if digit_sum == 17:
            print(f"Found candidate: {m}")
            return m
        m += 17

if __name__ == "__main__":
    min_m = find_min_m()
    print(f"Smallest m is: {min_m}")
```
