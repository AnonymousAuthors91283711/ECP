theorem omnimath1168 : 
  let rec f : {n : ℕ // n ≥ 2} → ℚ 
    | ⟨2, _⟩ => 2
    | ⟨n + 3, h⟩ => (n + 3) + (1/2) * f ⟨n + 2, by omega⟩;
  f ⟨2002, by simp⟩ = omnimath1168_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Computing f(n) for small values:
f(2) = 2
f(3) = 4.0
f(4) = 6.0
f(5) = 8.0
f(6) = 10.0
f(7) = 12.0
f(8) = 14.0
f(9) = 16.0
f(10) = 18.0
f(11) = 20.0
f(12) = 22.0
f(13) = 24.0
f(14) = 26.0
f(15) = 28.0
f(16) = 30.0
f(17) = 32.0
f(18) = 34.0
f(19) = 36.0

Verifying hypothesis for small n:
n=2: exact=2, hypothesis=4.0
n=3: exact=4.0, hypothesis=4.0
n=4: exact=6.0, hypothesis=5.0
n=5: exact=8.0, hypothesis=6.5
n=6: exact=10.0, hypothesis=8.25
n=7: exact=12.0, hypothesis=10.125
n=8: exact=14.0, hypothesis=12.0625
n=9: exact=16.0, hypothesis=14.03125

Final approximation for f(2002):
4000. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Looking at the pattern, we can see that f(n) = 2n-2 for n ≥ 2. The enumerated values show this exact linear relationship (f(2)=2, f(3)=4, f(4)=6, etc.). This matches all given examples perfectly.
