[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer k such that there exists no positive integer n where the floor of 2002/n equals k. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal k by checking each possible k in order until we find one that cannot be expressed as floor(2002/n) for any n.

The approach:
1. Generate all possible floor(2002/n) values for n from 1 to 2002
2. Store these values in a set
3. Check integers k starting from 1 upwards until we find the smallest k not in this set

```python
def find_min_k():
    max_n = 2002
    possible_ks = set()
    
    # Generate all possible floor(2002/n) values
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        k = 2002 // n
        possible_ks.add(k)
    
    # Find the smallest positive integer not in possible_ks
    k = 1
    while True:
        if k not in possible_ks:
            print(f"Found minimal k: {k}")
            return
        k += 1

find_min_k()
```
