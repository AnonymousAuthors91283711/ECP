The error occurs because Lean doesn't recognize the complex number 'I' (imaginary unit) directly. In Lean, complex numbers are constructed using Complex.I. The enumerated answers show three distinct solutions: -1, i, and -i. 

Here's the corrected answer using proper Lean notation for complex numbers:

<<<{k : ℂ | k = -1 ∨ k = Complex.I ∨ k = -Complex.I}>>>

Explanation:
1. The error was due to using 'I' instead of 'Complex.I' for the imaginary unit
2. The enumerated solutions clearly show three roots: -1, i, and -i
3. The solution set matches the pattern seen in the enumerated answers
4. We maintain the same structure of the set comprehension, just with proper Lean syntax for complex numbers
5. The answer is generalized to include all three roots observed in the enumeration

The solution represents all complex numbers k that satisfy the given system of equations, which are the roots of unity (specifically the primitive 4th roots) plus -1.
