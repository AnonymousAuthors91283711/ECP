[write_program]
This problem asks for all integer pairs (a, b) that satisfy the equation (b² + 7(a - b))² = a³b. We'll write a Python program to search for solutions by checking small integer values.

The approach:
1. Iterate over possible a and b values within a reasonable range
2. For each pair, check if it satisfies the equation
3. Print valid pairs as they're found
4. Since we don't know the range, we'll search symmetrically around zero

```python
def find_solutions():
    # Search range - adjust if needed
    search_range = 100
    print(f"Searching for solutions in range [-{search_range}, {search_range}]")
    
    found = []
    for a in range(-search_range, search_range + 1):
        if a == 0:  # Skip a=0 to avoid division by zero in check
            continue
        for b in range(-search_range, search_range + 1):
            left = (b**2 + 7*(a - b))**2
            right = a**3 * b
            if left == right:
                found.append((a, b))
                print(f"Found solution: (a, b) = ({a}, {b})")
    
    print("\nAll found solutions:")
    for sol in found:
        print(sol)

find_solutions()
```
