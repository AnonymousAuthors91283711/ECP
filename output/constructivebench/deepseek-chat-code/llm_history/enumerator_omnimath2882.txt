[write_program]
This problem asks for the sum of all positive divisors of 1184. We'll write a Python program to:
1. Find all positive divisors of 1184
2. Sum them up
3. Print the result

The program will:
- Factorize 1184 first (2^5 Ã— 37^1)
- Generate all divisors using the prime factorization
- Sum them and print the result

```python
def sum_of_divisors(n):
    # Handle edge case
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Factorize n
    factors = {}
    temp = n
    # Check for 2 separately
    while temp % 2 == 0:
        factors[2] = factors.get(2, 0) + 1
        temp = temp // 2
    # Check odd divisors up to sqrt(n)
    i = 3
    max_factor = int(temp**0.5) + 1
    while i <= max_factor:
        while temp % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            temp = temp // i
            max_factor = int(temp**0.5) + 1
        i += 2
    if temp > 1:
        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate sum of divisors using the formula
    total = 1
    for p, exp in factors.items():
        total *= (p**(exp + 1) - 1) // (p - 1)
    
    return total

# Calculate and print the sum for 1184
print(sum_of_divisors(1184))
```
