[write_program]
This problem asks to find the integer value of b (not equal to 3) that satisfies the equation (3 + b)/(3 - b) = -4. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible integer values of b and check which ones satisfy the equation.

The approach is:
1. Iterate through a reasonable range of integer values for b
2. For each b â‰  3, check if (3 + b)/(3 - b) equals -4
3. Since we're dealing with integers, we'll avoid floating point operations by cross-multiplying

```python
def solve():
    for b in range(-20, 21):  # Check a reasonable range around 0
        if b == 3:
            continue  # Skip b=3 as per problem condition
        # Cross-multiply to avoid floating point: (3 + b) == -4*(3 - b)
        if (3 + b) == -4 * (3 - b):
            print(f"Found solution: b = {b}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```
