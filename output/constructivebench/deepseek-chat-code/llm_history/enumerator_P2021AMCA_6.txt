[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that there exist natural numbers r and b with:
1. r + b = n
2. r/n = 1/3
3. r/(n+4) = 1/4

We'll write a Python program to find the smallest n satisfying these conditions by enumerating possible values of n and checking the constraints.

```python
def find_min_n():
    # We'll search for n in increasing order until we find the smallest solution
    n = 1
    while True:
        # Check if n is divisible by 3 (from condition 2)
        if n % 3 == 0:
            r = n // 3
            # Check condition 3: r/(n+4) = 1/4
            if 4 * r == (n + 4):
                print(f"Found solution: n={n}, r={r}, b={n-r}")
                print(f"Minimum n is {n}")
                return
        n += 1

find_min_n()
```
