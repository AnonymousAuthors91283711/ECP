Ground Truth Answer: 3 / 16
Proposed Answer: 1 / 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating the probability that both Rachel's and Robert's positions (defined via fractional parts) are within 1/8 of 1/2 during a specific time interval [600, 660].

2. The ground truth answer is 3/16 ≈ 0.1875.

3. The proposed answer is 1/4 = 0.25.

4. To verify:
   - Rachel's cycle is 90 seconds (fractional part of t/90)
   - Robert's cycle is 80 seconds (fractional part of t/80)
   - The time interval is 60 seconds (660-600)
   - The condition requires both fractional parts to be in [3/8,5/8]
   - The overlap probability should be less than either individual probability (which would be 1/4 each if independent, but they're not)

The proposed answer of 1/4 is incorrect as it's larger than the ground truth and doesn't account for the interaction between the two cycles. The correct probability should be smaller due to the non-alignment of the two cycles.
