[write_program]
This problem involves finding the cardinality of set A given certain conditions on sets A and B that partition the numbers from 1 to 2006. The conditions specify how sums and products of elements from A and B behave. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible configurations for smaller values to identify a pattern.

Key observations:
1. A and B partition numbers 1..n (n=2006 in original problem)
2. B ⊆ A (which implies B must be empty since A ∩ B = ∅)
3. Sum and product conditions imply certain closure properties

Given hAB (A ∩ B = ∅) and h1 (B ⊆ A), the only possibility is B = ∅. Then A must be all numbers 1..n. But we need to verify the other conditions hold in this case.

```python
def verify_conditions(n):
    A = set(range(1, n+1))
    B = set()
    
    # Check condition h2: ∀a∈A, ∀b∈B, a+b∈[1,n] → a+b∈B
    # Since B is empty, condition is vacuously true
    h2 = True
    
    # Check condition h3: ∀a∈A, ∀b∈B, a*b∈[1,n] → a*b∈A
    # Since B is empty, condition is vacuously true
    h3 = True
    
    return len(A)

# Test for small values of n to see the pattern
for n in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 100, 1000, 2006]:
    print(f"n={n}, |A|={verify_conditions(n)}")
```
