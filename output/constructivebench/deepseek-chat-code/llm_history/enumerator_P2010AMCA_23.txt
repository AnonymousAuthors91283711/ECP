This problem asks for the last two non-zero digits of 90 factorial (90!). To solve this computationally, we need to calculate 90! and then find the last two non-zero digits by removing trailing zeros and taking the last two digits before any remaining zeros.

The approach involves:
1. Computing the factorial of 90
2. Converting it to a string to easily manipulate digits
3. Removing trailing zeros
4. Taking the last two non-zero digits

Here's the Python program to solve this:

```python
import math

def last_two_non_zero_digits(n):
    # Compute factorial
    fact = math.factorial(n)
    # Convert to string and remove trailing zeros
    s = str(fact).rstrip('0')
    # Get last two non-zero digits
    return int(s[-2:]) if len(s) >= 2 else int(s)

# Compute for 90!
result = last_two_non_zero_digits(90)
print(result)
```
