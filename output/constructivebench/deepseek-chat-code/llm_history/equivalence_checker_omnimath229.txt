Ground Truth Answer: {0, (fun x => x ^ 2)}
Proposed Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | f = (fun _ => (0 : ℝ)) ∨ (∃ c, f = (fun x => x^2 + c))}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

The problem is a functional equation:
(f x + x * y) * f (x - 3 * y) + (f y + x * y) * f (3 * x - y) = (f (x + y)) ^ 2

Ground truth gives two solutions:
1. The zero function (f(x) = 0)
2. The quadratic function (f(x) = x²)

Proposed answer suggests:
1. The zero function (f(x) = 0)
2. A family of functions f(x) = x² + c for some constant c

Testing the proposed family:
For f(x) = x² + c, let's plug into the equation:
Left side: (x² + c + xy)((x-3y)² + c) + (y² + c + xy)((3x-y)² + c)
Right side: ((x+y)² + c)²

The left side expands to a very complex expression that only equals the right side when c = 0. For any c ≠ 0, the equation doesn't hold. Therefore, the only valid solution in this family is f(x) = x² (when c=0).

The proposed answer incorrectly includes all functions x² + c, when only c=0 works. The ground truth correctly identifies only the specific cases that satisfy the equation.
