theorem omnimath3996 : 
  IsGreatest {m : ℕ | ∃ a ≤ 1983, m = Nat.card {b | a + b ∣ a * b}} omnimath3996_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: New max m=1 found at a=2
New max m=2 found at a=4
New max m=4 found at a=6
New max m=7 found at a=12
New max m=10 found at a=24
New max m=13 found at a=30
New max m=22 found at a=60
New max m=31 found at a=120
New max m=37 found at a=180
New max m=40 found at a=210
New max m=52 found at a=360
New max m=67 found at a=420
New max m=94 found at a=840
New max m=112 found at a=1260
New max m=121 found at a=1680
Final maximum m is 121 (achieved at a=1680). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<121>>>
