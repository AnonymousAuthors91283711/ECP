theorem olympiadbench2560 :
  {p : ℝ × ℝ | p.1 ^ 2 - p.1 * p.2 + 8 = 0 ∧ p.1 ^ 2 - 8 * p.1 + p.2 = 0} = olympiadbench2560_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(-1, -9), (4 + 2 * Real.sqrt 2, 8), (4 - 2 * Real.sqrt 2, 8)}
Proposed Answer: {(2 + 2 * Real.sqrt 2, 8), (2 - 2 * Real.sqrt 2, 8), (-1, -9)}
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. The ground truth answer has three points:
   - (-1, -9)
   - (4 + 2√2, 8)
   - (4 - 2√2, 8)

2. The proposed answer has three points:
   - (2 + 2√2, 8)
   - (2 - 2√2, 8)
   - (-1, -9)

The difference is in the x-coordinates of the points with y=8. The ground truth has 4 ± 2√2 while the proposed answer has 2 ± 2√2. These are different points, so the answers are not equivalent.
