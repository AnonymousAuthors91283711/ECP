This problem involves finding the value of a multivariate polynomial P(x,y,z) evaluated at (2,4,8) given certain conditions. The polynomial is cyclic (invariant under cyclic permutation of variables), vanishes when x=y, and has total degree 4. We'll enumerate possible polynomial forms that satisfy these conditions.

The approach is to:
1. Consider all possible monomials of degree â‰¤4 that could form a cyclic polynomial
2. Apply the x=y zero condition to eliminate terms
3. Use the evaluation at (1,2,3) to determine coefficients
4. Finally evaluate at (2,4,8)

from itertools import combinations_with_replacement
from collections import defaultdict
from fractions import Fraction

def generate_cyclic_monomials():
    # Generate all degree <=4 monomials in x,y,z up to cyclic permutation
    monomials = set()
    for deg in range(5):
        for c in combinations_with_replacement([0,1,2], deg):
            # Get canonical cyclic form by sorting all rotations
            rotated = []
            for i in range(3):
                rotated.append(tuple(sorted((i+j)%3 for j in c)))
            canonical = min(rotated)
            monomials.add(canonical)
    return sorted(monomials, key=lambda m: (len(m), m))

def monomial_to_str(m):
    if not m:
        return "1"
    counts = [0,0,0]
    for i in m:
        counts[i] += 1
    return f"x^{counts[0]}y^{counts[1]}z^{counts[2]}"

def eval_monomial(m, vals):
    result = 1
    for i in m:
        result *= vals[i]
    return result

    monomials = generate_cyclic_monomials()
    print("Considering cyclic monomial basis:")
    for m in monomials:
        print(monomial_to_str(m))
    
    # Apply x=y zero condition: coefficients must satisfy certain relations
    # We'll represent each monomial's coefficient as a variable
    # Then set up equations based on evaluation conditions
    
    # For x=y, P(x,x,z) = 0 gives us relations between coefficients
    # We'll skip this step and instead directly parameterize the possible space
    
    # The general form is likely a multiple of (x-y)(y-z)(z-x)(x+y+z)
    # But degree would be 5, so we need degree 4 terms
    
    # Alternative approach: assume it's a linear combination of elementary symmetric polynomials
    # But with degree 4, we need to consider products
    
    # Let's try to find a combination that satisfies all conditions
    # We'll parameterize possible cyclic polynomials of degree 4
    
    # Possible basis: (x^2y^2 + y^2z^2 + z^2x^2), (x^3y + cyclic), (x^2yz + cyclic), etc.
    
    # For simplicity, we'll just try to find coefficients that work for the given points
    
    # We know P(1,2,3)=1 and P(1,1,2)=0
    # Let's assume P is of form a*(x-y)(y-z)(z-x)(x+y+z) + b*(x-y)(y-z)(z-x)
    # But degree is too high, so this can't work
    
    # Alternative approach: since P is cyclic and vanishes when x=y, it must have (x-y)(y-z)(z-x) as factor
    # But that's degree 3, so remaining factor must be degree 1 and cyclic
    
    # So P = k*(x-y)(y-z)(z-x)*(x+y+z)
    # Now check P(1,2,3) = k*(1-2)(2-3)(3-1)(6) = k*(-1)(-1)(2)(6) = 12k = 1 => k=1/12
    
    # Now evaluate at (2,4,8):
    # P(2,4,8) = (1/12)*(2-4)(4-8)(8-2)(14) = (1/12)*(-2)(-4)(6)(14) = (1/12)*672 = 56
    
    # So the answer appears to be 56
    
    # Let's verify:
    k = Fraction(1,12)
    p123 = k * (1-2)*(2-3)*(3-1)*(1+2+3)
    print(f"P(1,2,3) = {p123} (should be 1)")
    
    p111 = k * (1-1)*(1-1)*(1-1)*(3)  # should be 0
    print(f"P(1,1,1) = {p111} (should be 0)")
    
    p112 = k * (1-1)*(1-2)*(2-1)*(4)  # should be 0
    print(f"P(1,1,2) = {p112} (should be 0)")
    
    p248 = k * (2-4)*(4-8)*(8-2)*(14)
    print(f"Final answer: P(2,4,8) = {p248}")
