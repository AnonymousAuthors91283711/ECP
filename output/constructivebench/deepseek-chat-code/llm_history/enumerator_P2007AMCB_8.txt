[write_program]
This problem appears to be a mathematical competition problem involving natural numbers T, N, and coefficients c₁, c₂, c₃ with certain constraints. The goal is to find the ratio T/N. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of T and N that satisfy the given conditions, then compute T/N for these cases to identify a pattern.

The constraints are:
1. 0 < N < T
2. c₁ + c₂ + c₃ = T
3. T - N = 2*((c₁ - N) + (c₂ - N) + (c₃ - N))

We'll simplify the third condition algebraically and search for small integer solutions.

```python
def find_solutions(max_T=20):
    for T in range(1, max_T + 1):
        for N in range(1, T):
            # Simplify the third condition: T - N = 2*(c1 + c2 + c3 - 3N)
            # But c1 + c2 + c3 = T, so T - N = 2*(T - 3N)
            # Which simplifies to T - N = 2T - 6N => -T + 5N = 0 => T = 5N
            if T == 5 * N:
                # Now find c1, c2, c3 that sum to T and each >= N (since c_i - N must be natural)
                # The exact values of c_i don't affect the ratio T/N = 5
                print(f"T={T}, N={N}, T/N={T/N}")
                # For any valid N, the ratio is consistently 5
    print("From enumeration, the consistent ratio is 5")

find_solutions()
```
