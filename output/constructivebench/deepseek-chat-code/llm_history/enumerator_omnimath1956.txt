The problem asks to count numbers between 1 and 10^6 where the number is less than or equal to the sum of its proper divisors (numbers less than n that divide n). This is similar to finding abundant numbers (where sum of proper divisors exceeds the number), but includes numbers equal to their proper divisor sum (perfect numbers).

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Iterate through numbers from 1 to 10^6
2. For each number, find its proper divisors
3. Sum the proper divisors
4. Count numbers where n â‰¤ sum of proper divisors

```python
def sum_proper_divisors(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    total = 1  # 1 is a proper divisor for n > 1
    sqrt_n = int(n**0.5)
    for i in range(2, sqrt_n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            total += i
            other = n // i
            if other != i:
                total += other
    return total

count = 0
for n in range(1, 10**6 + 1):
    sum_div = sum_proper_divisors(n)
    if n <= sum_div:
        count += 1
        print(n)  # Stream found numbers

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
