Based on the problem statement and the constraints given in P, we're looking for the smallest sum a+b+c+d where a,b,c,d are positive integers with specific gcd conditions. The conditions require that:
1. gcd(a,c)=1 and gcd(b,d)=1 (diagonal pairs are coprime)
2. gcd(a,b), gcd(b,c), gcd(c,d), gcd(d,a) ≠ 1 (adjacent pairs are not coprime)

The minimal solution satisfying these conditions is when a,b,c,d are all 2, but this fails the coprime conditions. The next smallest solution comes from using numbers that share factors with their neighbors but not diagonally. The smallest such configuration is [2,6,3,4] with sum 15.
