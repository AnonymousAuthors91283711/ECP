[write_program]
This problem involves finding integer coefficients k, l, m, n that satisfy two conditions involving a rational function and a ratio of coefficients. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible small integer values for these coefficients and check the conditions.

The approach:
1. Compute the left-hand side expression finv(c)*c*f(c) symbolically
2. Enumerate small integer values for k, l, m, n (say -5 to 5)
3. For each combination, check if the first condition holds for arbitrary c
4. For valid combinations, compute the ratio k*n²/(l*m)
5. Output all valid combinations and their ratios

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    # We'll test with c = 2 (arbitrary choice not equal to 3/2)
    c_test = 2
    
    # Define the functions f and finv
    def f(c):
        return 3 / (2 * c - 3)
    
    def finv(c):
        return (3 + 3 * c) / (2 * c)
    
    # Compute the target value
    target = finv(c_test) * c_test * f(c_test)
    
    # Search range for coefficients
    min_val, max_val = -5, 5
    
    found = set()
    
    for k in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
        for l in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
            for m in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
                for n in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
                    if m == 0 or l == 0:
                        continue  # Avoid division by zero

                    numerator = k * c_test + l
                    denominator = m * c_test + n
                    if denominator == 0:
                        continue
                    
                    if abs((numerator / denominator) - target) > 1e-6:
                        continue
                    
                    # Check if the form holds symbolically
                    # The expression should simplify to (3c + 3)/(2c - 3)
                    # So we need (k*c + l)/(m*c + n) ≡ (3c + 3)/(2c - 3)
                    # Cross-multiplying gives: (k*c + l)*(2c - 3) ≡ (3c + 3)*(m*c + n)
                    # Comparing coefficients gives:
                    # 2k = 3m
                    # -3k + 2l = 3n + 3m
                    # -3l = 3n

                            (-3 * k + 2 * l) == (3 * n + 3 * m) and 
                            (-3 * l) == (3 * n)):

                    # Compute the ratio

Judgement Explanation:
1. The program correctly implements the mathematical problem by checking both numerical and symbolic conditions for the coefficients.
2. It uses a reasonable search range (-5 to 5) to find integer solutions.
3. The program properly handles division by zero cases.
4. It verifies both the functional equality and the coefficient conditions.
5. The output format shows each valid solution found and then the common ratio.
6. The program runs without requiring any input arguments.

However, the program reports an "empty result" error, which suggests it didn't find any solutions in the given range. This is likely because the search range (-5 to 5) is too small to contain the actual solution. The correct solution should be found with a slightly larger range.

<<<False>>>

Here's the corrected program with an expanded search range:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    # We'll test with c = 2 (arbitrary choice not equal to 3/2)
    c_test = 2
    
    # Define the functions f and finv
    def f(c):
        return 3 / (2 * c - 3)
    
    def finv(c):
        return (3 + 3 * c) / (2 * c)
    
    # Compute the target value
    target = finv(c_test) * c_test * f(c_test)
    
    # Expanded search range for coefficients
    min_val, max_val = -10, 10
    
    found = set()
    
    for k in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
        for l in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
            for m in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
                for n in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
                    if m == 0 or l == 0:
                        continue  # Avoid division by zero
                    
                    # Check first condition
                    numerator = k * c_test + l
                    denominator = m * c_test + n
                    if denominator == 0:
                        continue
                    
                    if abs((numerator / denominator) - target) > 1e-6:
                        continue
                    
                    # Check if the form holds symbolically
                    if not (2 * k == 3 * m and 
                            (-3 * k + 2 * l) == (3 * n + 3 * m) and 

[refine_program]
Judgement Explanation:
1. The problem is a mathematical theorem from Lean (Mathlib) involving finding integer coefficients k, l, m, n that satisfy two conditions related to a function and its inverse.
2. The "program" section is empty, which means no attempt was made to solve the problem computationally.
3. The problem requires finding integer solutions to an equation involving rational functions, which is suitable for computational enumeration.
4. We need to create a Python program that systematically searches for integer solutions (k, l, m, n) that satisfy both conditions for some sample value of c (avoiding c=3/2).

The original submission is empty and therefore rejected.

Here's a corrected Python program that enumerates possible solutions:

```python

    c = Fraction(2)  # Simple rational value
    
    # Define the functions

        return 3 / (2 * c_val - 3)
    
    def finv(c_val):
        return (3 + 3 * c_val) / (2 * c_val)
    
    # Target expression
    target = finv(c) * c * f(c)
    
    # Search range for integer coefficients
    max_coeff = 5
    
    print(f"Searching for k,l,m,n ∈ [-{max_coeff},{max_coeff}] with c = {c}")
    
    # Enumerate all possible combinations
    for k in range(-max_coeff, max_coeff + 1):
        for l in range(-max_coeff, max_coeff + 1):
            for m in range(-max_coeff, max_coeff + 1):
                for n in range(-max_coeff, max_coeff + 1):
                    if m == 0 and n == 0:
                        continue  # Skip invalid denominator
                    
                    # First condition
                    expr = (k * c + l) / (m * c + n)
                    if expr != target:

                    # Second condition (avoid division by zero)
                    if l == 0 or m == 0:
                        continue
                    
                    kn2 = k * n**2
                    lm = l * m
                    if kn2 % lm != 0:
                        continue
