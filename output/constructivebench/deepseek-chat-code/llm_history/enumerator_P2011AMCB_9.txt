This problem involves calculating the ratio of two areas in ℝ²: the area where both coordinates are in [-20,10] and their product is positive (A), divided by the total area of [-20,10]×[-20,10]. The positive product condition means both coordinates are positive or both are negative.

We'll compute this by:
1. Calculating the total area (30×30 = 900)
2. Calculating the area where both are positive (10×10 = 100)
3. Calculating the area where both are negative (20×20 = 400)
4. The ratio is (100+400)/900 = 500/900 = 5/9

Here's the Python program to verify this:

```python
def calculate_ratio():
    # Total interval lengths
    x_min, x_max = -20, 10
    y_min, y_max = -20, 10
    
    # Total area
    total_area = (x_max - x_min) * (y_max - y_min)
    
    # Positive quadrant area (both x and y > 0)
    pos_area = (x_max - 0) * (y_max - 0)
    
    # Negative quadrant area (both x and y < 0)
    neg_area = (0 - x_min) * (0 - y_min)
    
    # Area where product is positive
    positive_product_area = pos_area + neg_area
    
    # Calculate the ratio
    ratio = positive_product_area / total_area
    
    # Output exact fraction and decimal approximation
    print(f"Positive product area: {positive_product_area}")
    print(f"Total area: {total_area}")
    print(f"Ratio: {ratio} (exact fraction: 5/9)")

calculate_ratio()
```
