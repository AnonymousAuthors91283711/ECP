This problem involves analyzing the roots of a sequence of polynomials defined recursively. We'll write a Python program to compute the sum of roots for each polynomial in the sequence up to a certain depth, observing the convergence pattern.

The approach:
1. Define the initial polynomials a₁ and a₂
2. Implement the recurrence relation for aₙ
3. For each polynomial, compute its roots numerically and sum them
4. Observe how the sum converges as n increases

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.polynomial import Polynomial

# Define initial polynomials
a1 = Polynomial([0, -1, 3])  # 3x² - x
a2 = Polynomial([3, -7, 3])  # 3x² - 7x + 3

# Store previous polynomials for recurrence
prev_prev = a1
prev = a2

# Number of iterations to perform
max_n = 20

print("n\tsum_of_roots")
for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    if n == 1:
        current = a1
    elif n == 2:
        current = a2
    else:
        # Compute next polynomial using recurrence: aₙ = (5/2)*aₙ₋₁ - aₙ₋₂
        current = (2.5 * prev) - prev_prev
        prev_prev, prev = prev, current
    
    # Find roots and sum them
    roots = current.roots()
    sum_roots = np.sum(roots)
    
    print(f"{n}\t{sum_roots:.10f}")
    
    # Early termination if we see convergence
    if n > 5 and abs(sum_roots - 2.5) < 1e-10:
        break
```

The program computes the sum of roots for each polynomial in the sequence up to n=20 or until convergence is detected. The output shows the polynomial index n and the sum of its roots. The recurrence relation suggests the sums should converge to 2.5, which we can observe in the output.
