[write_program]
This problem involves computing a product of logarithms with varying bases and arguments. We'll write a Python program to enumerate the values for small n â‰¥ 2 to help identify the pattern.

The program will:
1. Compute the product for n from 2 to a reasonable threshold (say 10)
2. Calculate each term in the product accurately
3. Output both the product and simplified form if possible

```python
import math

def compute_product(n):
    product = 1.0
    for k in range(n - 1):
        base = n - k
        arg = 1 / (k + 2)
        term = math.log(arg, base)
        product *= term
    return product

max_n = 10
for n in range(2, max_n + 1):
    result = compute_product(n)
    print(f"n={n}: {result}")
    # Check if result is approximately 1/(n*(n-1))
    expected = 1/(n*(n-1))
    print(f"  Comparison with 1/(n(n-1)): {expected}, difference: {abs(result - expected)}")
```
