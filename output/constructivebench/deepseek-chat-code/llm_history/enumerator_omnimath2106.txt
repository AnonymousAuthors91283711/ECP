[write_program]
The problem asks to count how many integers n between 1 and 10000 satisfy the condition that floor(sqrt(ceil(sqrt(n)))) equals ceil(sqrt(floor(sqrt(n)))). We'll write a Python program to enumerate and count these numbers.

Key observations:
1. We need to compute nested square roots with floor/ceil operations
2. The condition involves comparing two different ways of nesting these operations
3. We'll check each number from 1 to 10000

```python
import math

def satisfies_condition(n):
    sqrt_n = math.sqrt(n)
    ceil_sqrt_n = math.ceil(sqrt_n)
    floor_sqrt_n = math.floor(sqrt_n)
    
    # Compute floor(sqrt(ceil(sqrt(n))))
    term1 = math.floor(math.sqrt(ceil_sqrt_n))
    
    # Compute ceil(sqrt(floor(sqrt(n))))
    term2 = math.ceil(math.sqrt(floor_sqrt_n))
    
    return term1 == term2

count = 0
for n in range(1, 10001):
    if satisfies_condition(n):
        count += 1
        print(n)  # Stream partial results

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
