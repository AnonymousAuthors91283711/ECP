abbrev olympiadbench2338_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2338 :
  {x : ℝ | (x ^ 2 + x + 4) / (2 * x + 1) = 4 / x} = olympiadbench2338_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Valid solutions:
x = -2
x = -1
x = 2

Exact forms:
x = -2.000000000 (approximation)
x = -1.000000000 (approximation)
x = 2.000000000 (approximation). Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
<<<{-2, -1, 2}>>>
