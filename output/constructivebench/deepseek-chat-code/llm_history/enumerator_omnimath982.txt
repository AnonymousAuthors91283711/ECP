This problem involves calculating the measure (area) of a subset of the unit square [0,1]×[0,1] defined by certain conditions involving odd integers. We'll approach it by:

1. Discretizing the problem by considering rational approximations
2. Checking the conditions for points in a grid
3. Estimating the area by counting valid points

We'll use a grid of size N×N and count points satisfying the conditions, then compute the ratio to total points as an approximation of the measure.

```python
import math

def is_odd(n):
    return n % 2 == 1

def main():
    N = 1000  # Grid size
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(1, N):
        x = i / N
        for j in range(1, N):
            y = j / N
            if x + y == 0:
                continue
            value = (x - y) / (x + y)
            n = round(value)
            if is_odd(n) and abs(value - n) < 0.5:
                count += 1
    
    area_estimate = count / (N * N)
    print(f"Area estimate with N={N}: {area_estimate}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
