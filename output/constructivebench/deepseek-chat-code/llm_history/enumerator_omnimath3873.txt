[write_program]
This problem asks for all positive integers n where n³ + 3 is divisible by n² + 7. We'll write a Python program to find all such n up to a reasonable threshold (1000 in this case) by checking the divisibility condition directly.

The approach is:
1. Iterate through positive integers n from 1 to 1000
2. For each n, compute n³ + 3 and n² + 7
3. Check if the remainder is zero
4. Print all n that satisfy the condition

```python
def find_solutions():
    max_n = 1000
    solutions = []
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        numerator = n**3 + 3
        denominator = n**2 + 7
        if numerator % denominator == 0:
            solutions.append(n)
            print(n)
    print("All solutions found up to n =", max_n, ":", solutions)

find_solutions()
```
