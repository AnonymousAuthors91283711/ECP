Minimum sum of squares found: 6. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the enumerated answers, the minimum sum of squares is 6, achieved by permutations of (-1, -1, 2). The symmetric solution (a=b=c) doesn't satisfy the equation, so we need to use the asymmetric solution. The sum of squares for (-1, -1, 2) is (-1)^2 + (-1)^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6.

The error in the proposed answer was trying to use `Real.sqrt 6` when we actually want the exact value 6. The square root was unnecessary since we're dealing with the sum of squares directly.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<6>>>
