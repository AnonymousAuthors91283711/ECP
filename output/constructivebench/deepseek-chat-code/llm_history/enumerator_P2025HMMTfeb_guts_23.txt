[write_program]
This problem appears to involve finding a pattern in polynomial evaluations modulo 101². We'll write a Python program to explore the behavior of polynomial f (though its exact form isn't specified) by testing small integer values and looking for periodicity or other patterns modulo 101².

Since the problem mentions f(a) ≡ 20 mod 101², we'll search for values where this holds, then examine f(a+101) mod 101². We'll use small sample values to conjecture the pattern.

```python
def f(x):
    # Placeholder for the polynomial function f
    # Since the actual polynomial isn't specified, we'll use a simple quadratic for demonstration
    return x**2 + 3*x + 5

modulus = 101**2
target = 20

# Search for a values where f(a) ≡ 20 mod 101²
print(f"Searching for a where f(a) ≡ {target} mod {modulus}")
for a in range(0, 1000):
    if (f(a) - target) % modulus == 0:
        print(f"Found a = {a}")
        next_val = f(a + 101) % modulus
        print(f"f({a} + 101) mod {modulus} = {next_val}")

# After finding several examples, we can observe the pattern
# For this demo polynomial, the output would show the pattern
# In the actual problem, we'd need to see the polynomial definition
```
