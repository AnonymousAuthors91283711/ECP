The problem asks to find the greatest natural number n such that there exists a natural number m where m > 0, n > 0, and (m + n)/2 = 5. This means m + n = 10, and we need to find the maximum possible n where m is also positive.

We'll enumerate all pairs (m, n) where m + n = 10 and m, n > 0, then find the maximum n. The solution is straightforward since we can iterate through possible values.

```python
def find_max_n():
    max_n = 0
    for m in range(1, 10):  # m can be from 1 to 9 since n must be >=1
        n = 10 - m
        if n > 0:
            print(f"Found valid pair: m={m}, n={n}")
            if n > max_n:
                max_n = n
    print(f"The greatest n is: {max_n}")

find_max_n()
```
