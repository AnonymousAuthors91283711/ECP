[write_program]
This problem involves finding two natural numbers S and B such that:
1. 4*S = 7*B (ratio condition)
2. S = B + 12 (difference condition)
and then computing their sum S + B.

We'll write a Python program to find such numbers by iterating through possible values of B and checking both conditions. The solution will be exact since we're dealing with integer equations.

```python
def find_solution():
    # Iterate B from 1 upwards until we find a solution
    B = 1
    while True:
        S = B + 12  # From hmore condition
        # Check ratio condition 4*S == 7*B
        if 4 * S == 7 * B:
            print(f"Found solution: S={S}, B={B}")
            print(f"S + B = {S + B}")
            return
        B += 1

find_solution()
```
