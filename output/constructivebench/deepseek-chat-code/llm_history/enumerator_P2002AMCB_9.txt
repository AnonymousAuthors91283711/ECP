This problem involves finding the ratio a/d given certain arithmetic and geometric conditions on positive real numbers a, b, c, d. We'll approach it by:

1. Modeling the arithmetic progression condition (b-a = c-b = d-c)
2. Incorporating the geometric condition (b/a = d/b)
3. Solving for the ratio a/d

The solution will involve setting up equations based on these conditions and solving them symbolically.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def solve_problem():
    # Define variables
    a, b, c, d, r = symbols('a b c d r', positive=True)
    
    # Arithmetic progression conditions (common difference)
    eq1 = Eq(b - a, c - b)
    eq2 = Eq(c - b, d - c)
    
    # Geometric condition
    eq3 = Eq(b/a, d/b)
    
    # Solve the system of equations
    solution = solve([eq1, eq2, eq3], (b, c, d))
    
    # Express in terms of a
    b_expr = solution[0][0]
    c_expr = solution[0][1]
    d_expr = solution[0][2]
    
    # Calculate the ratio a/d
    ratio = a / d_expr
    simplified_ratio = ratio.simplify()
    
    print(f"The ratio a/d is: {simplified_ratio}")
