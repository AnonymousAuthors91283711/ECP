This problem involves finding all positive integers m for which there exist integer sequences a and g such that:
1. For all n, (aₙ - gₙ) is divisible by m
2. (a₂ - a₁) is not divisible by m

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible m values by checking these conditions for small m. The key insight is that m must allow sequences where differences between consecutive a terms aren't divisible by m, while still maintaining the divisibility condition with g.

```python
def is_valid_m(m):
    # Check if there exists sequences a and g satisfying the conditions
    # For m=1: impossible since all differences are divisible by 1
    if m == 1:
        return False
    
    # For m>1, we can construct sequences:
    # Let a_n = n (so a₂ - a₁ = 1 not divisible by m if m>1)
    # Let g_n = n (so a_n - g_n = 0 always divisible by m)
    # This satisfies both conditions when m>1
    return True

def main():
    max_m = 20  # Check up to this value
    valid_ms = []
    
    for m in range(1, max_m + 1):
        if is_valid_m(m):
            valid_ms.append(m)
            print(f"Found valid m: {m}")
    
    print("\nAll valid m up to", max_m, "are:", valid_ms)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
