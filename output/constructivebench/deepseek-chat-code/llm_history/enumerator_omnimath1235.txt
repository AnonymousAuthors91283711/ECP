This problem involves calculating the product of tangent functions evaluated at specific multiples of π/7. We'll write a Python program to compute this product numerically to help conjecture the exact value.

The approach will:
1. Compute π/7, 2π/7, and 3π/7
2. Calculate the tangent of each angle
3. Multiply them together
4. Output the result with high precision

We'll use Python's math module for trigonometric functions and decimal module for high precision calculations.

```python
import math
from decimal import Decimal, getcontext

# Set high precision for calculations
getcontext().prec = 50

# Compute the angles
pi = Decimal(math.pi)
angles = [pi/7, 2*pi/7, 3*pi/7]

# Calculate tangent of each angle
tangents = [Decimal(math.tan(float(angle))) for angle in angles]

# Compute the product
product = tangents[0] * tangents[1] * tangents[2]

# Output the result
print(f"tan(π/7) * tan(2π/7) * tan(3π/7) ≈ {product}")
```
