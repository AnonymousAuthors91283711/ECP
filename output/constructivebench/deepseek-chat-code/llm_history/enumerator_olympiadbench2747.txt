This problem asks for the smallest natural number n such that 1/2^n < 1/6084. We need to find the minimal n where 2^n > 6084. We'll compute powers of 2 until we find the smallest one exceeding 6084.

```python
def find_min_n():
    T = 1 / 6084
    n = 1
    while True:
        current = 1 / (2 ** n)
        if current < T:
            print(f"Found valid n: {n} (1/2^{n} = {current} < {T})")
            return n
        n += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Searching for minimal n where 1/2^n < 1/6084")
    min_n = find_min_n()
    print(f"Minimal n found: {min_n}")
```
