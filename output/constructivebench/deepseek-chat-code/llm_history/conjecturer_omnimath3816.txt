The error occurs because we're trying to use `0` as a proposition (Prop) in the set definition. In Lean, we need to use `∨` (logical or) for propositions and proper function equality syntax. Here's the corrected version:

<<<{f | f = (fun _ => 0) ∨ f = id ∨ f = (fun x => x^2)}>>>

Explanation:
1. The error was due to incorrect syntax for function equality and logical operations in set builder notation.
2. We need to wrap each function definition in parentheses when using equality comparisons.
3. The enumerated answers suggest three possible solutions: zero function, identity function, and square function.
4. The pattern matches the functional equation's requirements, as:
   - For f(x)=0: Both sides become 0
   - For f(x)=x: The equation becomes (x+z)(y+t) = (xy-zt)+(xt+yz) which holds by algebra
   - For f(x)=x²: The equation becomes (x²+z²)(y²+t²) = (xy-zt)²+(xt+yz)² which is a known identity

The corrected version properly represents these three functions in Lean syntax.
