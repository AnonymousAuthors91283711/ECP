This problem asks for the number of 7-length integer sequences where each element is between -1 and 1 (inclusive), and the sum of products of consecutive pairs (first 6 pairs) equals 4. We'll enumerate all possible sequences and count those satisfying the conditions.

```python
from itertools import product

def main():
    count = 0
    # Each element can be -1, 0, or 1
    values = [-1, 0, 1]
    # Generate all possible 7-length sequences
    for seq in product(values, repeat=7):
        # Calculate sum of a_i * a_{i+1} for first 6 pairs
        total = sum(seq[i] * seq[i+1] for i in range(6))
        if total == 4:
            count += 1
            print(seq)  # Print each valid sequence
    print("Total count:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
