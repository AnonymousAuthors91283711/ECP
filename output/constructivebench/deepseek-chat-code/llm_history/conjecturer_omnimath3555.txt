Based on the problem statement and the pattern of close divisors near √n, the answer likely involves numbers with exactly 2020 divisors in the range (√n, 2√n). The simplest case would be numbers of the form p^(2k) where p is prime and k is chosen to give exactly 2020 divisors in this range.

<<<∃ (k : ℕ), 2020 = k - 1 ∧ k > 1>>>
