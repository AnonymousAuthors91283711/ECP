[write_program]
This problem asks whether there exist integers x and y such that (2x+1)^3 + 1 = y^4. We'll write a Python program to search for such solutions by enumerating possible values of y and checking if the resulting equation gives an integer x.

The approach:
1. Since y^4 must equal (2x+1)^3 + 1, we'll iterate possible y values
2. For each y, compute y^4 - 1 and check if it's a perfect cube
3. If it is, check if the cube root is odd (since 2x+1 must be odd)
4. If both conditions are met, we've found a solution

We'll search within a reasonable range of y values (both positive and negative) to find any solutions.

```python
def find_solutions():
    max_y = 20  # Reasonable search range
    solutions = []
    
    for y in range(-max_y, max_y + 1):
        y4_minus_1 = y**4 - 1
        if y4_minus_1 == 0:
            continue  # Would give x = -0.5 which isn't integer
        
        # Check if y4_minus_1 is a perfect cube
        cube_root = round(abs(y4_minus_1) ** (1/3))
        if cube_root ** 3 == abs(y4_minus_1):
            if y4_minus_1 < 0:
                cube_root = -cube_root
            
            # Check if cube_root is odd (since 2x+1 must be odd)
            if cube_root % 2 == 1:
                x = (cube_root - 1) // 2
                solutions.append((x, y))
                print(f"Solution found: x = {x}, y = {y}")
    
    if not solutions:
        print("No solutions found in the search range")
    else:
        print("Search complete")

find_solutions()
```
