[write_program]
This problem involves finding a unique pair (a, b) such that for all (x, y, z) in set S, x続 + y続 can be expressed as a*10^(3z) + b*10^(2z), and then determining a + b. We'll approach this by testing small integer values for x, y, z to find patterns and constraints.

The Python program will:
1. Test small integer values for x, y, z (from -3 to 3)
2. For each valid (x,y,z) combination, compute x続 + y続
3. Express this as a*10^(3z) + b*10^(2z) and solve for a,b
4. Track consistent (a,b) pairs across different (x,y,z) combinations
5. Output candidate pairs and their sum a + b

```python
def main():
    # Test small integer values for x, y, z
    for x in range(-3, 4):
        for y in range(-3, 4):
            for z in range(-3, 4):
                if z == 0:
                    continue  # Avoid division by zero in later steps
                lhs = x**3 + y**3
                # Express as a*10^(3z) + b*10^(2z)
                # Let's solve for a and b
                # We need two equations, so we'll use two different z values
                # But for simplicity, we'll just show the relationship
                # For a given z, we can express b in terms of a:
                # b = (lhs - a*10^(3z)) / 10^(2z)
                # We'll look for integer solutions
                
                # For z=1: lhs = a*1000 + b*100
                # For z=2: lhs = a*1000000 + b*10000
                # Let's focus on z=1 and z=2 to find consistent a,b
                if z == 1:
                    # lhs = 1000a + 100b
                    # Try to find integer a,b that satisfy this
                    found = False
                    for a in range(-10, 11):
                        for b in range(-100, 101):
                            if 1000*a + 100*b == lhs:
                                print(f"For (x,y,z)=({x},{y},{z}), possible (a,b)=({a},{b})")
                                found = True
                                # Check if this pair works for z=2
                                if 1000000*a + 10000*b == x**3 + y**3:
                                    print(f"Consistent for z=2: (a,b)=({a},{b})")
                                    print(f"a + b = {a + b}")
                    if not found:
