[write_program]
This problem asks for the sum of the supremum and infimum of the set S defined by {3/a + b | 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 2}. We'll write a Python program to explore the extreme values of this function over the given domain.

The approach is:
1. Sample points in the a-b plane where 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 2
2. Calculate x = 3/a + b for each point
3. Track the minimum and maximum x values found
4. Output their sum

We'll use a grid search with small enough steps to get accurate results.

```python
def main():
    min_x = float('inf')
    max_x = -float('inf')
    step = 0.001  # Small step for precision
    
    a = 1.0
    while a <= 2.0:
        b = a  # Since a ≤ b
        while b <= 2.0:
            x = 3/a + b
            if x < min_x:
                min_x = x
            if x > max_x:
                max_x = x
            b += step
        a += step
    
    print(f"Minimum x found: {min_x}")
    print(f"Maximum x found: {max_x}")
    print(f"Sum of sup and inf: {max_x + min_x}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
