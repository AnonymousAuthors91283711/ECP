: IsLeast {y | ∃ f : ℕ → ℕ, (∀ m n : ℕ, f (n ^ 2 * f m) = m * (f n) ^ 2) ∧ y = f 1998} omnimath3973_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 1998 factors: {2: 1, 3: 3, 37: 1}
Minimal f(1998): 666

Verification for small n:
f(1) = 1
f(2) = 2
f(3) = 3
f(4) = 2
f(5) = 5
f(6) = 6
f(7) = 7
f(8) = 4
f(9) = 3
f(10) = 10. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<666>>>
