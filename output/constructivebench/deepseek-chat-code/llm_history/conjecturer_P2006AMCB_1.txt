abbrev P2006AMCB_1_answer : ℕ → ℤ := sorry
theorem P2006AMCB_1 (n : ℕ) (hn : n = 2006) :
  (∑ k in Finset.range n, (-1 : ℤ) ^ (k + 1)) = P2006AMCB_1_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=1: sum = -1
n=2: sum = 0
n=3: sum = -1
n=4: sum = 0
n=5: sum = -1
n=6: sum = 0
n=7: sum = -1
n=8: sum = 0
n=9: sum = -1
n=10: sum = 0

For n=2006: sum = 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℤ
<<<fun n : ℕ => if n % 2 = 0 then 0 else -1>>>
