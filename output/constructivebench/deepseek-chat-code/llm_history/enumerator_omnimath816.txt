This problem involves computing the floor of the ratio of 2002 factorial divided by the sum of factorials from 1 to 2001. To approach this, we can observe that for smaller values, the sum of factorials up to n-1 is very close to (n!)/n, making the ratio approximately n. We'll test this pattern with smaller values to conjecture the answer.

```python
import math

def compute_ratio(n):
    """Compute floor(n! / sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k!)"""
    numerator = math.factorial(n)
    denominator = sum(math.factorial(k) for k in range(1, n))
    return numerator // denominator

# Test the pattern for smaller values
for n in range(2, 20):
    result = compute_ratio(n)
    print(f"n={n}: floor(n! / sum) = {result}")

# The pattern suggests the answer is n-1, so for n=2002:
print("\nConjectured answer for n=2002:", 2002 - 1)
```
