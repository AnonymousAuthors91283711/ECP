Ground Truth Answer: 106
Proposed Answer: 2^(2^10) - 1
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem asks to find m and n such that:
1. They are positive integers
2. They are coprime
3. Their product equals ∏(2^(2^k)+1) for k=0 to 9
4. m + n equals some answer (ground truth is 106)

The proposed answer suggests that m/n = 2^(2^10) - 1.

Let's verify:
The product ∏(2^(2^k)+1) for k=0 to 9 is known to telescope to (2^(2^10)-1)/1 because:
(2^(2^0)+1)(2^(2^1)+1)...(2^(2^9)+1) = (2^(2^10)-1)/(2^(2^0)-1) = 2^(2^10)-1

Thus m = 2^(2^10)-1 and n = 1, which satisfies:
- m,n > 0
- Coprime since n=1
- The product condition
- m + n = 2^(2^10)-1 + 1 = 2^(2^10)

However, the ground truth answer is 106, which is much smaller than 2^(2^10). Therefore, the proposed answer doesn't match the required m+n value.
