[write_program]
This problem is about finding the smallest natural number n such that for any two sequences of integers a and b of length n, there exists another sequence x of length n where:
1. At least one x_i is coprime with m (where m > 1)
2. The dot products a·x and b·x are both congruent to 0 modulo m

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of n for small m values (2,3,4,5) to help conjecture the pattern.

```python
import math
from itertools import product

def is_coprime(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b) == 1

def check_condition(m, n):
    # Generate all possible a and b vectors modulo m (since we only care about mod m)
    # For efficiency, we limit to small m and n
    possible_values = range(-m, m+1)
    
    # Try all possible a and b vectors (mod m)
    for a in product(possible_values, repeat=n):
        for b in product(possible_values, repeat=n):
            found = False
            # Try all possible x vectors (mod m)
            for x in product(range(m), repeat=n):
                # Check condition 1: at least one x_i coprime with m
                has_coprime = any(is_coprime(xi, m) for xi in x)
                if not has_coprime:
                    continue
                
                # Check condition 2: both dot products ≡ 0 mod m
                dot_a = sum(a[i] * x[i] for i in range(n)) % m
                dot_b = sum(b[i] * x[i] for i in range(n)) % m
                if dot_a == 0 and dot_b == 0:
                    found = True
                    break
            
            if not found:
                return False
    return True

def find_min_n(m):
    n = 1
    while True:
        if check_condition(m, n):
            print(f"For m={m}, found minimal n={n}")
            return n
        n += 1
        if n > 10:  # Safety limit
            print(f"For m={m}, no solution found up to n=10")
            return None

# Test for small m values
for m in [2, 3, 4, 5]:
    find_min_n(m)
```
