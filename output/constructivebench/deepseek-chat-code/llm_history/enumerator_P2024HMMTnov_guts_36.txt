[write_program]
This problem involves computing a complex double sum involving factorials and comparing it to an unknown constant E. We'll write a Python program to compute the double sum numerically and see if we can recognize the pattern or exact value.

The key observations:
1. The expression involves factorials up to 100, so we need exact integer arithmetic
2. The double sum runs from i=0 to 40 and j=0 to 40
3. We need to compute the exact rational value before converting to float

We'll use Python's built-in integers for exact arithmetic and fractions.Fraction for exact rational arithmetic.

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    # Precompute factorials up to 100! once for efficiency
    facts = [1]
    for n in range(1, 101):
        facts.append(facts[-1] * n)
    
    # Compute the double sum using exact arithmetic
    total = Fraction(0)
    for i in range(41):
        for j in range(41):
            numerator = facts[i + j + 18]
            denominator = facts[i] * facts[j] * facts[18]
            term = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
            total += term
    
    # Compute the prefactor
    prefactor = Fraction(facts[20] * facts[40] * facts[40], facts[100])
    
    # Multiply to get exact value
    exact_value = prefactor * total
    
    # Convert to float for numerical approximation
    approx_value = float(exact_value)
    
    print(f"Approximate value: {approx_value:.10f}")
    print(f"Exact value numerator: {exact_value.numerator}")
    print(f"Exact value denominator: {exact_value.denominator}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program computes the exact rational value of the expression and prints both its floating-point approximation and exact numerator/denominator form. The exact form might reveal a pattern that could help conjecture the closed-form answer. The floating-point approximation helps verify if the value matches any known mathematical constants.
