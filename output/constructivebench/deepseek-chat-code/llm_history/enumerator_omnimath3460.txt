[write_program]
This problem asks to find all pairs of rational numbers (p₁, p₂) in a given list where the average of 73, 82, 85, p₁, and p₂ is less than 80. We'll write a Python program to enumerate such pairs from a sample list.

The key steps are:
1. Create a sample list of rational pairs (using fractions for exact arithmetic)
2. For each pair, calculate the average of the five numbers
3. Check if the average is less than 80
4. Print qualifying pairs immediately when found

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def enumerate_qualifying_pairs():
    # Sample list of rational pairs (p1, p2)
    sample_pairs = [
        (Fraction(70, 1), Fraction(90, 1)),
        (Fraction(75, 1), Fraction(85, 1)),
        (Fraction(80, 1), Fraction(80, 1)),
        (Fraction(65, 1), Fraction(95, 1)),
        (Fraction(79, 1), Fraction(81, 1)),
        (Fraction(50, 1), Fraction(100, 1)),
        (Fraction(73, 1), Fraction(82, 1)),
    ]
    
    fixed_numbers = [73, 82, 85]
    
    for p1, p2 in sample_pairs:
        total = sum(fixed_numbers) + p1 + p2
        average = total / 5
        if average < 80:
            print(f"Qualifying pair: ({p1}, {p2}) with average {average}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_qualifying_pairs()
```
