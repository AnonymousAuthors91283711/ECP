This problem involves finding the value of f(1) given a functional equation and two specific values. The functional equation suggests a linear relationship. We'll test linear functions f(x) = ax + b to find possible solutions that satisfy the given conditions.

```python
def check_linear(a, b):
    # Verify if f(x) = a*x + b satisfies the functional equation
    # The equation f(x) + f(y) = f(x+1) + f(y-1) must hold for all x,y
    # For linear functions, this simplifies to:
    # a*x + b + a*y + b = a*(x+1) + b + a*(y-1) + b
    # Which simplifies to 0 = 0, so all linear functions satisfy it
    
    # Now check the specific conditions
    f2016 = a * 2016 + b
    f6102 = a * 6102 + b
    return f2016 == 6102 and f6102 == 2016

# We'll solve the system:
# a*2016 + b = 6102
# a*6102 + b = 2016
# Subtract equations:
# a*(2016-6102) = 6102-2016
a = (6102 - 2016) / (2016 - 6102)
b = 6102 - a * 2016

# Now compute f(1)
f1 = a * 1 + b

# Output the exact fractional form to avoid floating point approximation
print(f"f(1) = {f1}")
print(f"Exact form: f(1) = (6102*6101 - 2016*2015)/(6102-2016)")
```
