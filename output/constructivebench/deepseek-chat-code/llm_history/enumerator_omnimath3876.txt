[write_program]
This problem asks us to find all functions f: ℕ → ℕ that satisfy the functional equation f(f(n) + f(m)) = m + n for all natural numbers m, n. The solution likely involves linear functions, so we'll enumerate linear candidates and verify them against small values.

We'll test functions of the form f(n) = a*n + b, checking for small integer coefficients a and b. The program will print any functions that satisfy the equation for test cases up to n=5.

```python
def check_function(a, b):
    """Check if f(n) = a*n + b satisfies the functional equation for small values."""
    def f(n):
        return a * n + b
    
    for m in range(0, 6):
        for n in range(0, 6):
            lhs = f(f(n) + f(m))
            rhs = m + n
            if lhs != rhs:
                return False
    return True

def enumerate_functions():
    """Enumerate linear functions and check them against the functional equation."""
    # Reasonable bounds for coefficients based on problem constraints
    for a in range(-5, 6):
        for b in range(-5, 6):
            if check_function(a, b):
                print(f"Found candidate: f(n) = {a}n + {b}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_functions()
    print("Enumeration complete.")
```
