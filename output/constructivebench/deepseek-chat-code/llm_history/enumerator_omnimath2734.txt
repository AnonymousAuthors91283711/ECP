This problem involves finding the value of c given three average conditions. We'll solve the system of equations derived from the averages. The key is to express all variables in terms of c and find the exact value that satisfies all conditions.

```python
# Solving the system:
# (a+b+c)/3 = 16 => a+b+c = 48 (1)
# (c+d+e)/3 = 26 => c+d+e = 78 (2)
# (a+b+c+d+e)/5 = 20 => a+b+c+d+e = 100 (3)
# Subtract (1) from (3): d+e = 52
# Subtract (2) from (3): a+b = 22
# From (1): c = 48 - (a+b) = 48 - 22 = 26

# The exact value of c is:
print(26)
```
