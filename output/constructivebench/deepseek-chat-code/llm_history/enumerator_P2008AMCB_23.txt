[write_program]
This problem asks for a natural number n such that the sum of logarithms (base 10) of all divisors of 10^n equals 792. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible n values and compute this sum for each.

Key observations:
1. The divisors of 10^n = (2*5)^n = 2^n * 5^n are all numbers of form 2^a * 5^b where 0 ≤ a,b ≤ n
2. The number of divisors is (n+1)^2
3. log10(2^a * 5^b) = a*log10(2) + b*log10(5) = a*log10(2) + b*(1-log10(2))
4. The sum can be computed by considering all combinations of a and b

```python
import math

log10_2 = math.log10(2)
log10_5 = math.log10(5)

def compute_sum(n):
    total = 0.0
    for a in range(n + 1):
        for b in range(n + 1):
            d = (2 ** a) * (5 ** b)
            total += math.log10(d)
    return total

# Search for n where sum is approximately 792
# We'll check n up to 100 since 10^100 has many divisors
for n in range(1, 101):
    s = compute_sum(n)
    print(f"n={n}, sum={s}")
    if abs(s - 792) < 1e-6:  # Account for floating point precision
        print(f"Found candidate: n={n}")
        break
```
