This problem involves computing a piecewise integral with three cases. We'll break it down into the three intervals and compute each part separately, then sum them up. The integrand is multiplied by 1/2, which we can factor out.

The three cases are:
1. t ∈ [0, 0.25]: constant 50
2. t ∈ (0.25, 0.5]: linear function 50 - 60*(t - 0.25)
3. t ∈ (0.5, 2]: zero

We'll compute each integral separately and sum them up to get the final answer.

```python
def compute_integral():
    # First interval [0, 0.25]: constant 50
    integral1 = 50 * (0.25 - 0)
    
    # Second interval (0.25, 0.5]: linear function
    # Integral of 50 - 60*(t - 0.25) = 50 - 60t + 15
    # = 65 - 60t
    # Antiderivative: 65t - 30t^2
    a, b = 0.25, 0.5
    integral2 = (65*b - 30*b**2) - (65*a - 30*a**2)
    
    # Third interval (0.5, 2]: zero
    integral3 = 0
    
    # Multiply by 1/2 and sum all parts
    total = (integral1 + integral2 + integral3) * 0.5
    return total

result = compute_integral()
print(f"The integral evaluates to: {result}")
print(f"Exact fraction: {result.as_integer_ratio()}")
```
