This problem involves solving a system of equations to find a linear combination of variables. We'll enumerate possible rational solutions for small parameter values to identify patterns. The key is to recognize this as a system of linear equations where we can express the desired quantity in terms of the given equations.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the system of equations
# We'll solve for a, b, c, d using the given equations
A = np.array([
    [1, 1, 1, 1],        # a + b + c + d = 1
    [1, 2, 3, 4],        # a + 2b + 3c + 4d = 10
    [1, 4, 9, 16],       # a + 4b + 9c + 16d = 100
    [1, 8, 27, 64]       # a + 8b + 27c + 64d = 1000
])
b = np.array([1, 10, 100, 1000])

# Solve the system
solution = np.linalg.solve(A, b)
a, b, c, d = solution

# Compute the target expression: a + 16b + 81c + 256d
target = a + 16*b + 81*c + 256*d

# Convert to fraction and simplify
from fractions import Fraction
frac = Fraction(target).limit_denominator()

# Output the result
print(f"Solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}")
print(f"Target expression value: {target}")
print(f"Rational form: {frac.numerator}/{frac.denominator}")
print(f"Final answer (m + n): {frac.numerator + frac.denominator}")
```
