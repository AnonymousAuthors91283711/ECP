This problem asks for the smallest positive integer x such that there exists a positive integer y satisfying 7x⁵ = 11y¹³. We'll write a Python program to search for such pairs (x, y) by checking possible exponents that make both sides equal.

The approach:
1. The equation implies x must be divisible by 11 and y must be divisible by 7
2. Let x = 11ᵃ * 7ᵇ * k₁, y = 7ᶜ * 11ᵈ * k₂ where k₁,k₂ are coprime with 7,11
3. Substitute into the equation and analyze exponents
4. Search for minimal x by checking possible exponents

```python
import math

def find_min_x():
    # We'll search for minimal x by checking possible exponents
    # The exponents must satisfy certain divisibility conditions
    for a in range(1, 20):
        for b in range(0, 20):
            # Calculate required exponents based on equation
            # From 7x^5 = 11y^13, we get constraints on exponents
            c = (5*b - 1) / 13
            d = (5*a - 1) / 13
            if c.is_integer() and d.is_integer() and c >= 0 and d >= 0:
                c = int(c)
                d = int(d)
                # Calculate minimal x and y
                x = (11**a) * (7**b)
                y = (7**c) * (11**d)
                # Verify the solution
                if 7 * (x**5) == 11 * (y**13):
                    print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}")
                    print(f"Minimal x found: {x}")
                    return
    print("No solution found in search range")

find_min_x()
```
