Ground Truth Answer: 36 / 35
Proposed Answer: 1 + (1 / 35)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the least positive real number x where floor(x)/(x - floor(x)) = 35.

2. Let's break this down:
   - Let n = floor(x), so n ≤ x < n+1
   - The equation becomes n/(x - n) = 35
   - Solving for x: x = n + n/35 = n(1 + 1/35)

3. The smallest positive x occurs when n=1:
   - x = 1 + 1/35 = 36/35

4. Comparing the answers:
   - Ground truth: 36/35
   - Proposed: 1 + 1/35

These are exactly the same value expressed differently (36/35 = 1 + 1/35).
