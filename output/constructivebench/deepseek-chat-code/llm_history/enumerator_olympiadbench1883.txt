[write_program]
This problem involves finding the minimum size of a set S of integers such that for every Fibonacci number F_k (2 ≤ k ≤ n), there exist two elements in S whose difference equals F_k. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible set sizes for small values of n.

The approach:
1. Generate Fibonacci numbers up to F_n
2. For each possible set size m, check if there exists a set S of size m that contains pairs with all required differences
3. Find the smallest m that satisfies the condition

```python
def fibonacci_sequence(n):
    """Generate Fibonacci numbers up to F_n"""
    fib = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        fib.append(fib[i-1] + fib[i-2])
    return fib[2:]  # We only need F_2 to F_n

def has_required_differences(S, required_diffs):
    """Check if set S contains pairs with all required differences"""
    S_list = sorted(S)
    found_diffs = set()
    for i in range(len(S_list)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(S_list)):
            diff = S_list[j] - S_list[i]
            if diff in required_diffs:
                found_diffs.add(diff)
    return found_diffs == required_diffs

def find_min_set_size(n_max=8):
    """Find minimal set size for n from 2 to n_max"""
    for n in range(2, n_max+1):
        fibs = set(fibonacci_sequence(n))
        min_size = None
        
        # Try increasing set sizes until we find one that works
        for m in range(2, n+2):  # Reasonable upper bound
            # Try all possible sets of size m with elements in a limited range
            # This is a simplified approach - in reality we'd need a smarter search
            from itertools import combinations
            max_val = max(fibs) * 2  # Arbitrary limit for demonstration
            
            for candidate in combinations(range(-max_val, max_val+1), m):
                if has_required_differences(candidate, fibs):
                    min_size = m
                    print(f"n={n}: found set size {m}")
                    break
            if min_size is not None:
                break
        
        if min_size is None:
            print(f"n={n}: no solution found with current search limits")

find_min_set_size()
```
