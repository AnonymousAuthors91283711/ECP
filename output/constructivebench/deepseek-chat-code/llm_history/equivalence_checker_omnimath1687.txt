Ground Truth Answer: 1980
Proposed Answer: 3 * 11 * 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a system of equations involving three distinct primes p, q, r and a constant A. We need to solve for A.

2. The ground truth answer is 1980 (which factors as 2² × 3² × 5 × 11).

3. The proposed answer is 3 × 11 × 5 = 165.

The proposed answer is clearly different from the ground truth answer (165 ≠ 1980). The proposed answer doesn't even match the form of the ground truth answer's prime factorization.

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
