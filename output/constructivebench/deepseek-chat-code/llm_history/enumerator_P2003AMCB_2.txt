This problem involves solving a system of equations with two variables g and p. The first equation states g = p + 1, and the second equation states 14*(g + p) = 546. We need to find the value of g that satisfies both equations.

The approach is to:
1. Substitute g from the first equation into the second equation
2. Solve for p
3. Then find g using the first equation

Here's a Python program that verifies the solution by checking possible integer values around the expected solution:

```python
def solve_equation():
    # We know from the first equation that g = p + 1
    # Substitute into second equation: 14*(2p + 1) = 546
    # So 2p + 1 = 39 â†’ p = 19
    # Then g = 20
    
    # Let's verify by checking values around this solution
    for g in range(15, 25):  # Check a reasonable range
        p = g - 1
        if abs(14 * (g + p) - 546) < 1e-9:  # Account for floating point precision
            print(f"Found solution: g = {g}, p = {p}")
            return
    
    print("No solution found in the tested range")
