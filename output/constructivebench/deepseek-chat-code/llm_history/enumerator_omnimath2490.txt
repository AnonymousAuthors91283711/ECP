This problem asks for the sum of k^k from k=1 to 30303 modulo 101. We can optimize the computation using properties of modular arithmetic and Fermat's Little Theorem, since 101 is prime. For k ≥ 101, k^k ≡ k^(k mod (100)) mod 101 due to Fermat's Little Theorem (k^100 ≡ 1 mod 101 when k is not divisible by 101). When k is divisible by 101, k^k ≡ 0 mod 101.

The Python program will:
1. Compute the sum in chunks of 101 terms (since the pattern repeats every 101 terms)
2. Use modular exponentiation for efficiency
3. Handle the partial sum up to 30303 (which is 300 full cycles of 101 plus 3 extra terms)

```python
def solve():
    mod = 101
    total = 0
    n = 30303
    cycles = n // mod
    remainder = n % mod
    
    # Compute sum for full cycles (1..100)
    cycle_sum = 0
    for k in range(1, mod):
        # k^(k) + k^(k+100) + ... + k^(k + (cycles-1)*100)
        # Each term is k^k mod 101 since k^100 ≡ 1 mod 101
        # There are 'cycles' such terms
        term = pow(k, k, mod)
        cycle_sum = (cycle_sum + term * cycles) % mod
    
    # Compute sum for remaining terms (1..remainder)
    remainder_sum = 0
    for k in range(1, remainder + 1):
        remainder_sum = (remainder_sum + pow(k, k, mod)) % mod
    
    total = (cycle_sum + remainder_sum) % mod
    print(total)
