Based on the problem statement and the enumerated answer showing 41/80, I can see this is a probability problem where we need to find the simplified fraction for P_rain_at_least_one_day. The error in the original code appears to be formatting/syntax related to the let bindings.

The correct answer should be the pair (41, 80) since 41 and 80 are coprime (as required by the theorem) and represent the simplified fraction 41/80. The error message suggests syntax issues with the let bindings, but the mathematical content is correct.

Here's the fixed answer:

<<<(41, 80)>>>

Explanation:
1. The enumerated answer shows the fraction 41/80
2. The theorem requires the answer to be a coprime pair (a,b)
3. 41 and 80 are indeed coprime (gcd(41,80)=1)
4. The probability calculation leads to 41/80 when simplified
5. The error in the original code was purely syntactic (missing line breaks/semicolons between let bindings), not mathematical[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
