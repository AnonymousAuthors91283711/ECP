[write_program]
This problem asks to find all integer triples (x, y, z) that satisfy two equations:
1. x² - y² = z
2. 3xy + (x - y)z = z²

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible solutions within a reasonable range. The approach will be:
1. Iterate over possible x and y values in a symmetric range
2. Compute z from the first equation
3. Check if the second equation holds with these values
4. Print valid solutions as they're found

```python
def find_solutions(max_abs=100):
    solutions = []
    for x in range(-max_abs, max_abs + 1):
        for y in range(-max_abs, max_abs + 1):
            z = x*x - y*y
            # Check if second equation holds
            if 3*x*y + (x - y)*z == z*z:
                solutions.append((x, y, z))
                print(f"Solution found: (x={x}, y={y}, z={z})")
    return solutions

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Searching for solutions with |x|,|y| ≤ 100...")
    sols = find_solutions()
    print(f"Total solutions found: {len(sols)}")
```
