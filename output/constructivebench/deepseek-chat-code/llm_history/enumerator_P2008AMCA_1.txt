The problem involves calculating the time when a worker will finish a task given:
- Start time: 8:30 AM
- First interval end time: 11:10 AM (when 1/3 of work is done)
- Need to find when the remaining 2/3 of work will be completed at the same rate

We'll write a Python program to calculate the time by:
1. Converting times to minutes since midnight
2. Calculating work rate based on first interval
3. Computing remaining time needed
4. Adding to first interval time

```python
def minutes_since_midnight(h, m):
    return h * 60 + m

def time_add(h, m, add_mins):
    total = minutes_since_midnight(h, m) + add_mins
    return (total // 60, total % 60)

start_h, start_m = 8, 30
first_end_h, first_end_m = 11, 10

# Calculate time difference in minutes
time_diff = minutes_since_midnight(first_end_h, first_end_m) - minutes_since_midnight(start_h, start_m)

# Work rate (work per minute)
work_rate = (1/3) / time_diff

# Remaining work and time needed
remaining_work = 2/3
remaining_time = remaining_work / work_rate

# Calculate final time
final_h, final_m = time_add(first_end_h, first_end_m, remaining_time)

# Output partial results
print(f"First interval duration: {time_diff} minutes")
print(f"Work rate: {work_rate:.6f} work/minute")
print(f"Remaining time needed: {remaining_time:.2f} minutes")
print(f"Final time: {int(final_h)}:{int(final_m):02d}")
```
