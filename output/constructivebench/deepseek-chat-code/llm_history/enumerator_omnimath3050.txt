This problem appears to be a simple arithmetic equation where we need to compute the value of `4 * (4 * 5 + 2) + 2`. The program should compute this value directly since it's a straightforward calculation.

```python
# Compute the value of 4 * (4 * 5 + 2) + 2
result = 4 * (4 * 5 + 2) + 2
print(result)
```
