[write_program]
This problem appears to be a Lean theorem statement asking to prove some property `omnimath1622_answer` for all positive natural numbers `n`. Since we need to write a Python enumerator to help conjecture the property, I'll:

1. Assume `omnimath1622_answer` is some decidable property we can compute for small n
2. Enumerate small positive integers and check the property
3. Output results as we find them to help spot patterns

The Python program will check numbers from 1 upwards and print those satisfying some sample property (like being prime, perfect square, etc.) since the actual property isn't specified. This helps build intuition for the Lean theorem.

```python
def is_sample_property(n):
    """Example property - change this to match the actual problem"""
    return n % 4 == 1  # Example: numbers â‰¡1 mod4

def main():
    max_n = 20  # Reasonable enumeration limit
    print(f"Checking numbers 1 to {max_n} for the property:")
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        if is_sample_property(n):
            print(n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
