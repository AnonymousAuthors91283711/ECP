[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of equations with positive real variables x, y, z and finding a rational expression for z + 1/y in reduced form. We'll write a Python program to numerically explore possible solutions and identify the numerator and denominator.

The approach:
1. From the given equations, we can express all variables in terms of x
2. Solve numerically for x using the constraints
3. Compute z + 1/y and find its reduced fraction form
4. Enumerate possible fractions with denominators up to a reasonable limit

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def find_solution():
    # We'll search for x in a reasonable range that satisfies all conditions
    for x in range(1, 10000):
        x_val = x / 1000.0  # Use floating point for approximation
        try:
            # Calculate z from x + 1/z = 5 => z = 1/(5 - x)
            z_val = 1.0 / (5.0 - x_val)
            if z_val <= 0:
                continue
            
            # Calculate y from y + 1/x = 29 => y = 29 - 1/x
            y_val = 29.0 - 1.0 / x_val
            if y_val <= 0:
                continue
                
            # Verify x*y*z â‰ˆ 1 (due to floating point precision)
            if abs(x_val * y_val * z_val - 1.0) > 1e-6:
                continue
                
            # Compute z + 1/y
            result = z_val + 1.0 / y_val
            
            # Convert to fraction and simplify
            frac = Fraction(result).limit_denominator(1000000)
            m, n = frac.numerator, frac.denominator
            if math.gcd(m, n) == 1:  # Ensure reduced form
                print(f"Found candidate: {m}/{n}")
                return (m, n)
                
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            continue
    
    return None

# Execute the search
solution = find_solution()
if solution:
    m, n = solution
    print(f"Final answer: {m}/{n}")
else:
    print("No solution found in search range")
```
