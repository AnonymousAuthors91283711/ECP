This problem involves finding digits A, B, C (each between 0 and 9) such that (10A + B)² + (10A + C)² = 1313, then computing A + B + C. We'll enumerate all possible combinations of A, B, C to find valid solutions.

```python
def main():
    found = False
    for A in range(10):
        for B in range(10):
            for C in range(10):
                left = (10*A + B)**2 + (10*A + C)**2
                if left == 1313:
                    print(f"Found solution: A={A}, B={B}, C={C}, sum={A+B+C}")
                    found = True
    if not found:
        print("No solution found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
