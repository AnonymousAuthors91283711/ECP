[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of integer triples (x, y, z) such that x + y + z = 525, with x divisible by 7, y divisible by 5, and z divisible by 3. We can approach this by parameterizing the variables and counting the solutions.

Let:
- x = 7a
- y = 5b
- z = 3c
The equation becomes 7a + 5b + 3c = 525. We need to count non-negative integer solutions (a, b, c) to this equation.

The Python program will enumerate possible values of a and b, then check if c is a non-negative integer. We'll count all valid solutions.

```python
def count_solutions():
    count = 0
    max_a = 525 // 7  # Maximum possible a when b=c=0
    for a in range(0, max_a + 1):
        remaining_after_a = 525 - 7*a
        max_b = remaining_after_a // 5  # Maximum b when c=0
        for b in range(0, max_b + 1):
            remaining = remaining_after_a - 5*b
            if remaining >= 0 and remaining % 3 == 0:
                count += 1
    print(f"Total solutions: {count}")

count_solutions()
```
