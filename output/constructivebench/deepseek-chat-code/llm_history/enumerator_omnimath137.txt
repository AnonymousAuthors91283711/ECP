This problem involves finding integer coefficients (a,b,c,d,e,f) for a rational function approximation of the cube root of 2. The approximation should be better than the identity function. We'll search for small integer coefficients that satisfy the condition for R near 2^(1/3).

We'll:
1. Test small integer values (±2 range) for coefficients
2. Evaluate the approximation at R = 2^(1/3) + ε for small ε
3. Check if the error is smaller than ε
4. Print valid coefficient combinations

```python
import math

def main():
    cube_root_2 = 2 ** (1/3)
    epsilon = 1e-5  # small perturbation
    R = cube_root_2 + epsilon
    
    # Search range for coefficients
    min_coeff, max_coeff = -2, 2
    
    print("Searching for (a,b,c,d,e,f) where:")
    print(f"|(aR² + bR + c)/(dR² + eR + f) - 2^(1/3)| < |R - 2^(1/3)|")
    print(f"Testing coefficients in [{min_coeff}, {max_coeff}]")
    print("Valid combinations:")
