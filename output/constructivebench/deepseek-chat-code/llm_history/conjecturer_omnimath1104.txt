Based on the problem statement and the uparrow (tetration) function definition, we're looking for the smallest positive integer n where there exists some a > 0 such that a↑6 mod n ≠ a↑7 mod n. The key insight is that this occurs when n is the first number that can distinguish between these two extremely large exponents. The minimal such n is likely the smallest number where Euler's theorem fails to guarantee equality, which would be the first non-prime-power.
