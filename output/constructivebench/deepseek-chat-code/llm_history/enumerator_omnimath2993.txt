[write_program]
The problem asks for the number of positive integers k ≤ 2940 such that there exists an integer a where a² = gcd(205800, 35k). We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such k values.

Key observations:
1. gcd(205800, 35k) = 35 * gcd(5880, k) since 205800 = 35×5880
2. So we need 35 * gcd(5880, k) to be a perfect square
3. Which means gcd(5880, k) must be 35 times a perfect square (since 35 = 5×7)

```python
import math

def count_happy_pairs():
    count = 0
    m = 205800
    n_mult = 35
    max_k = 2940
    
    # Precompute all square divisors of 35 = 5×7
    # Possible square factors: 1 (1²) or 35 (since 35 = (√35)² but √35 isn't integer)
    # Wait no, for gcd(5880,k) to be 35*square, square must be perfect square dividing gcd
    # Actually, since 35 isn't square, the only possibility is gcd(5880,k) is itself a perfect square
    
    # Let's factorize 5880 = 2³ × 3 × 5 × 7²
    # For gcd(5880,k) to be perfect square, the exponents in prime factorization must all be even
    # So possible gcd values are divisors of 5880 where:
    # - exponent of 2 is 0 or 2
    # - exponent of 3 is 0
    # - exponent of 5 is 0 or 1 (but must be 0 for perfect square)
    # - exponent of 7 is 0 or 2
    # So possible gcd values: 1, 4, 49, 196
    
    possible_gcds = {1, 4, 49, 196}
    
    for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
        g = math.gcd(5880, k)
        if g in possible_gcds:
            count += 1
    
    print(f"Total happy pairs: {count}")

count_happy_pairs()
```
