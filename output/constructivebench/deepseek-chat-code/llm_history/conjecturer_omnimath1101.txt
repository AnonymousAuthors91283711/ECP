Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated answers, we observe two main patterns:
1. When m = n, the equation holds for any k=0
2. There are sporadic non-diagonal solutions (m ≠ n) with specific k values

The count of solutions is dominated by the diagonal cases (m=n) where k=0. For m,n ≤ 100, there are 100 such diagonal solutions (m=n=1 to 100). The non-diagonal cases are relatively few.
