[conjecture_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

open Nat Set

abbrev omnimath2396_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2396
: {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∃ A B : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ, Nontrivial (Invertible A) ∧ Nontrivial (Invertible B) ∧ A * B - B * A = B ^ 2 * A} = omnimath2396_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solution exists for n = 2
Solution exists for n = 3
Solution exists for n = 4
Solution exists for n = 5

Based on enumeration and pattern, solutions exist for all n ≥ 2





. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{n : ℕ | 2 ≤ n}>>>
