This problem involves finding natural numbers a and b such that a given 3x3 matrix M can be expressed as row_ops[i] + 2*col_ops[j] for all i,j, where the sums of row_ops and col_ops are a and b respectively, and a+b is minimized.

We'll approach this by:
1. Expressing the matrix equations for each cell
2. Finding constraints on row_ops and col_ops
3. Enumerating possible values that satisfy all constraints
4. Finding the minimal a+b

```python
def solve():
    M = [
        [7, 1, 5],
        [9, 3, 7],
        [8, 2, 6]
    ]
    
    # We'll express all variables in terms of col_ops[0] (c0)
    # From M[0][0] = r0 + 2*c0 => r0 = 7 - 2*c0
    # From M[0][1] = r0 + 2*c1 => 1 = (7-2*c0) + 2*c1 => c1 = c0 - 3
    # From M[1][0] = r1 + 2*c0 => r1 = 9 - 2*c0
    # From M[1][1] = r1 + 2*c1 => 3 = (9-2*c0) + 2*(c0-3) => 3=3 (consistent)
    # From M[2][0] = r2 + 2*c0 => r2 = 8 - 2*c0
    # From M[0][2] = r0 + 2*c2 => 5 = (7-2*c0) + 2*c2 => c2 = c0 - 1
    # From M[1][2] = r1 + 2*c2 => 7 = (9-2*c0) + 2*(c0-1) => 7=7 (consistent)
    # From M[2][1] = r2 + 2*c1 => 2 = (8-2*c0) + 2*(c0-3) => 2=2 (consistent)
    # From M[2][2] = r2 + 2*c2 => 6 = (8-2*c0) + 2*(c0-1) => 6=6 (consistent)

    best_ab = None
    
    # c0 must be >=3 since c1 = c0-3 >=0 (natural numbers)
    for c0 in range(3, 10):
        c1 = c0 - 3
        c2 = c0 - 1
        r0 = 7 - 2 * c0
        r1 = 9 - 2 * c0
        r2 = 8 - 2 * c0
        
        # Verify all values are natural numbers
        if r0 >=0 and r1 >=0 and r2 >=0 and c1 >=0 and c2 >=0:
            a = r0 + r1 + r2
            b = c0 + c1 + c2
            current_sum = a + b
            print(f"c0={c0}: a={a}, b={b}, a+b={current_sum}")
            
            if current_sum < min_sum:
                min_sum = current_sum
                best_ab = (a, b)
    
    print("\nMinimal a+b found:", min_sum)
