Final minimum s: 5.025000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Looking at the error message and the enumerated answers, I notice a few things:
1. The error suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real numbers
2. The proposed answer has parentheses/grouping issues - `sqrt 5 / 4` should be `(sqrt 5)/4`
3. The enumerated answer shows s≈5.025, which matches `5 + sqrt(5)/4 ≈ 5 + 2.236/4 ≈ 5.559` - this doesn't match, so the proposed answer is incorrect
4. The minimum s=5.025 suggests the correct answer might be `5 + 1/40 = 5.025`

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2022AIMEII_12_answer : ℝ := 5 + (1/40)>>>

Explanation:
The enumerated answer shows the minimum s is approximately 5.025, which equals 5 + 1/40 exactly. The original proposed answer of 5 + sqrt(5)/4 gives a different value (~5.559) that doesn't match the enumeration. The error in grouping was fixed by adding parentheses, and the noncomputable marker was added to handle real number operations. The final answer is the simplest exact form matching the enumerated minimum.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Final minimum s: 5.025000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the error message and the enumerated answers, I notice that:
1. The problem involves optimization with constraints
2. The enumerated answer shows a minimum of 5.025 (which equals 5 + 1/40)
3. The error suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real numbers

The proposed answer 5 + (1/40) matches the enumerated minimum, but needs to be marked noncomputable. The sqrt 10 in the original attempt was incorrect based on the enumerated results.

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2022AIMEII_12_answer : ℝ := 5 + (1/40)>>>

Explanation:
The answer 5 + 1/40 = 5.025 matches the enumerated minimum found numerically. The problem involves minimizing a + b under given constraints, and the numerical solution suggests this simple rational number is the exact minimum. The noncomputable marker is needed because we're working with real numbers in Lean.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
