[write_program]
This problem involves counting strictly decreasing functions under a specific condition. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible functions for small values of n and count those satisfying the given condition. The condition requires that for i < j, f(j) < f(i) + (j - i).

```python
from itertools import product

def count_valid_functions(n):
    """Count functions f: {0,...,n-1} -> {0,...,n-1} satisfying the condition."""
    count = 0
    # Generate all possible functions (n^n possibilities)
    for f in product(range(n), repeat=n):
        valid = True
        # Check the condition for all i < j
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                if not (f[j] < f[i] + (j - i)):
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1
            print(f"Found valid function for n={n}: {f}")  # Stream partial results
    return count

# Enumerate for small values of n
for n in range(1, 5):
    print(f"\nCounting for n={n}:")
    total = count_valid_functions(n)
    print(f"Total valid functions for n={n}: {total}")
```

The program:
1. Uses itertools.product to generate all possible functions from Fin n to Fin n
2. Checks each function against the given condition
3. Prints valid functions as they're found (streaming partial results)
4. Reports the total count for each n up to 4

For larger n, the computation becomes expensive (O(n^n) complexity), so we limit to small values. The output shows the pattern of valid functions and their counts, which can help conjecture the general formula.
