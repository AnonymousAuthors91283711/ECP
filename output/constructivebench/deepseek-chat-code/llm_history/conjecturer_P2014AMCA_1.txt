The error occurs because Lean needs to know that the division operation on ℝ is noncomputable. We need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real number division. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2014AMCA_1_answer : ℝ := 25/2>>>

Explanation:
1. The mathematical calculation is straightforward: 10 * (1/2 + 1/5 + 1/10)⁻¹ = 10 * (5/10 + 2/10 + 1/10)⁻¹ = 10 * (8/10)⁻¹ = 10 * (10/8) = 100/8 = 25/2
2. The enumerated answers confirm this exact value (25/2) and its decimal approximation (12.5)
3. The error occurs because real number division in Lean is noncomputable by default
4. Adding the 'noncomputable' modifier tells Lean not to try to compute this value during code execution, which resolves the error
5. The answer type remains ℝ as required by the problem statement[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the problem statement and error message, the issue is that we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real number division. The exact value 25/2 is correct, but we need to properly express it in Lean's real number system.

Here's the fixed answer with explanation:

The problem involves real number arithmetic (ℝ), and the exact answer is indeed 25/2. However, Lean requires noncomputable declarations when working with real numbers due to their axiomatic nature. The enumerated answers confirm the exact value is 25/2.

Based on the problem statement and error message, the issue is that we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real number division. The mathematical calculation is straightforward: we're computing 10 times the harmonic mean of 1/2, 1/5, and 1/10.

The exact value is indeed 25/2 as shown in the enumerated answers. Here's the corrected Lean expression:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2014AMCA_1_answer : ℝ := 25 / 2>>>

Explanation:
1. The error occurs because real number operations in Lean are noncomputable by default
2. We add the 'noncomputable' modifier to fix this
3. The value 25/2 is correct because:
   - Sum of reciprocals: 1/2 + 1/5 + 1/10 = 8/10 = 4/5
   - Reciprocal of sum: 5/4
   - Multiplied by 10: 10 * (5/4) = 50/4 = 25/2
4. This matches both the exact and approximate values given in the enumerated answers[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the error message and the problem statement, the issue is that Lean requires noncomputable annotation when working with real numbers (ℝ) due to their inherent computational complexity. The enumerated answers confirm the exact value should be 25/2.

Here's the fixed version with explanation:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2014AMCA_1_answer : ℝ := 25 / 2>>>

Explanation:
1. The error indicates we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real number division
2. The enumerated answers show the exact value is indeed 25/2
3. The problem involves simple arithmetic with fractions (1/2 + 1/5 + 1/10 = 8/10), and 10 * (10/8) = 25/2
4. The noncomputable annotation tells Lean this is a mathematical definition rather than an executable computation
