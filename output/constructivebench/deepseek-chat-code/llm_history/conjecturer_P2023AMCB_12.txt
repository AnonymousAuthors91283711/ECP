theorem P2023AMCB_12 (z : ℂ) :
    custom_op z z = z ^ 2 + 40 ↔ Complex.abs z = P2023AMCB_12_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 
Unique magnitudes found:. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the problem statement and the custom operation definition, we can see that `custom_op z z` is effectively squaring the real part and the imaginary part separately. The equation simplifies to requiring that the real and imaginary parts satisfy a particular relationship with the magnitude. The unique magnitude found suggests a constant solution.
