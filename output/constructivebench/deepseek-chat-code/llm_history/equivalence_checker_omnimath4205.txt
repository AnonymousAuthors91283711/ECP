abbrev omnimath4205_answer : ℕ → ℕ → Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath4205 (x y : ℕ) (hx : 0 < x) (hy : 0 < y) :
    (7*x^2 - 13*x*y + 7*y^2 : ℝ)^((1:ℝ)/3) = |(x:ℝ) - y| + 1 ↔ omnimath4205_answer x y := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => (x = 1 ∧ y = 1) ∨ 
    ∃ m, m ≥ 2 ∧ ({x, y} : Set ℕ) = {m^3 + m^2 - 2*m - 1, m^3 + 2*m^2 - m - 1}
Proposed Answer: fun x y : ℕ => ∃ k : ℕ, (x = k^2 + k + 1 ∧ y = (k + 1)^2 + (k + 1) + 1) ∨ (y = k^2 + k + 1 ∧ x = (k + 1)^2 + (k + 1) + 1)
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. The ground truth answer describes pairs (x,y) where either:
   - Both x and y are 1, OR
   - There exists m ≥ 2 such that {x,y} are specific cubic expressions in m

2. The proposed answer describes pairs where:
   - x and y are consecutive quadratic expressions in k (with k and k+1)

These are clearly different characterizations. The ground truth involves cubic expressions and a special case at (1,1), while the proposed answer uses quadratic forms and no special case. 

Testing with small values:
- For (1,1): Ground truth includes it, proposed answer doesn't (no k satisfies this)
- For (7,11): Ground truth includes it (m=2), proposed answer doesn't match
- For (13,21): Ground truth includes it (m=3), proposed answer doesn't match

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth in any case.
