[write_program]
This problem is about determining for which positive integers n there exists an r√óc matrix with distinct positive divisors of n where all row sums are equal and all column sums are equal. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible n values that satisfy these conditions.

The approach:
1. Generate positive integers n in order
2. For each n, find all its divisors
3. Check if there's a subset of divisors that can form such a matrix
4. We'll limit our search to small n values for demonstration

```python
import math
from itertools import combinations

def get_divisors(n):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(n // i)
    return sorted(divisors)

def is_possible(n):
    divisors = get_divisors(n)
    if len(divisors) < 4:  # Need at least 4 for smallest matrix (2x2)
        return False
    
    # Check for 2x2 magic squares
    for a, b, c, d in combinations(divisors, 4):
        if a + d == b + c and a != b and a != c and a != d and b != c and b != d and c != d:
            print(f"Found 2x2 solution for n={n}: [[{a}, {b}], [{c}, {d}]]")
            return True
    
    # For larger matrices, we'd need more complex checks
    # But for this demo we'll just check up to 2x2 cases
    return False

def main():
    max_n = 50  # Reasonable limit for demonstration
    print(f"Searching for solutions up to n={max_n}")
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        if is_possible(n):
            print(f"{n} is a valid solution")
    
    print("Search complete")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
