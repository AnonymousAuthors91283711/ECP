The problem is to find the sum m+n when p = m/n is a rational solution to the given binomial probability equation, where m and n are coprime. The equation simplifies to a ratio of probabilities for binomial outcomes.

We'll:
1. Simplify the given equation algebraically
2. Enumerate possible rational solutions p = m/n with m,n coprime
3. Find the solution where 0 < p < 1
4. Output m+n for the valid solution

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def find_solution():
    # Simplify the original equation: C(8,3)*p^3*(1-p)^5 = (1/25)*C(8,5)*p^5*(1-p)^3
    # C(8,3) = C(8,5) = 56, so equation becomes:
    # p^3*(1-p)^5 = (1/25)*p^5*(1-p)^3
    # Divide both sides by p^3*(1-p)^3 (valid since 0<p<1):
    # (1-p)^2 = (1/25)*p^2
    # Take square roots (positive since 0<p<1):
    # 1-p = (1/5)*p
    # Solve for p: 1 = p + p/5 => 1 = 6p/5 => p = 5/6
    
    # Verify the solution
    p = Fraction(5, 6)
    m, n = p.numerator, p.denominator
    assert math.gcd(m, n) == 1  # Check coprimality
    print(f"Found solution: p = {m}/{n}")
    print(f"m + n = {m + n}")
