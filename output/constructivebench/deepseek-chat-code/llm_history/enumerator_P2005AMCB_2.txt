[write_program]
This problem asks to find the positive real solution to the equation x/100 * x = 4. We can rewrite this as xÂ² = 400, so the solution is x = 20. The program will verify this by checking values around 20.

```python
def solve_equation():
    # We know the exact solution is 20, but we'll verify by checking nearby values
    for x in range(1, 100):
        if abs((x / 100) * x - 4) < 1e-9:  # Using a small epsilon for floating point comparison
            print(f"Found solution: x = {x}")

    # For demonstration, also show the exact calculation
    exact_solution = (4 * 100) ** 0.5
    print(f"Exact solution: x = {exact_solution}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_equation()
```
