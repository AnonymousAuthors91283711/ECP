theorem omnimath77 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ (m n : ℕ), 0 < m → 0 < n → m ≥ n → f (m * φ (n^3)) = f m * φ (n^3)) ↔ f ∈ omnimath77_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ (k : ℕ), ∀ (m : ℕ), 0 < m → f m = k * m}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ k : ℕ, f = fun n => n^k} ∪ {fun _ => 0}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about characterizing all functions f: ℕ → ℕ that satisfy the given functional equation involving Euler's totient function φ.

2. The ground truth answer states that these are exactly the functions that are linear multiples of the identity function (f(m) = k*m for some constant k) for positive m.

3. The proposed answer suggests two possibilities:
   - Power functions f(n) = n^k for some k
   - The zero function

Comparison:
- The zero function is included in both answers (k=0 in ground truth)
- The power functions n^k only match the ground truth when k=1 (linear case)
- For k≠1, n^k doesn't satisfy f(m) = k*m, so these don't match the ground truth
- The ground truth includes all linear functions, while the proposed answer misses all linear functions except identity (k=1) and zero (k=0)

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect as it includes wrong functions (n^k for k≠1) and misses correct ones (k*m for k≠0,1).
