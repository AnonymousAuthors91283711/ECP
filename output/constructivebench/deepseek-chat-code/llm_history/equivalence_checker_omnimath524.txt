Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n)! - 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n ! * (∑ k ∈ Finset.range n, (1 / k !)) + 1
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer is `n! - 1`, while the proposed answer is `n! * (∑ k ∈ Finset.range n, (1 / k!)) + 1`.

We know from mathematical series that:
`e = ∑ (k=0 to ∞) (1/k!)`

The partial sum `∑ k ∈ Finset.range n, (1 / k!)` is actually the Taylor series approximation of `e` up to `(n-1)!` terms.

However, the key observation is that:
`n! * (∑ k ∈ Finset.range n, (1 / k!)) = n! * (∑ k=0 to n-1 (1 / k!)) = ∑ k=0 to n-1 (n! / k!)`

This sum is actually equal to the number of derangements (permutations where no element appears in its original position) for n elements, which is known to be `round(n!/e)` for large n, but not exactly equal to `n! - 1`.

The proposed answer adds 1 to this sum, while the ground truth subtracts 1. They are not equivalent.
