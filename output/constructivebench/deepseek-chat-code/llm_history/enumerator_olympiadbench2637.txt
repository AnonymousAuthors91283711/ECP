[write_program]
The problem asks to compute the sum of reciprocals of all positive divisors of 24. We'll write a Python program to:

1. Find all positive divisors of 24
2. Calculate the sum of their reciprocals
3. Output the exact rational value (not decimal approximation)

The divisors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. We'll compute 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/24 as a fraction in simplest form.

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def get_divisors(n):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(n // i)
    return sorted(divisors)

def main():
    n = 24
    divisors = get_divisors(n)
    total = Fraction(0, 1)
    for d in divisors:
        total += Fraction(1, d)
    print(f"Sum of reciprocals of divisors of {n}: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
