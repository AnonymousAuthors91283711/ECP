The problem asks for the sum of all real numbers k such that the quadratic equation x² + 2kx + 7k - 10 = 0 has exactly one real solution. A quadratic equation has exactly one real solution when its discriminant is zero. We'll compute the discriminant and find all k values that make it zero, then sum them.

```python
def find_k_values():
    # The quadratic equation is x^2 + 2k*x + (7k-10) = 0
    # Discriminant D = (2k)^2 - 4*1*(7k-10) = 4k^2 - 28k + 40
    # For unique solution, D = 0 => 4k^2 - 28k + 40 = 0
    # Simplify: k^2 - 7k + 10 = 0
    # Solutions: k = [7 ± sqrt(49-40)]/2 = [7 ± 3]/2
    k1 = (7 + 3) / 2
    k2 = (7 - 3) / 2
    print(f"Found k values: {k1}, {k2}")
    print(f"Sum: {k1 + k2}")
