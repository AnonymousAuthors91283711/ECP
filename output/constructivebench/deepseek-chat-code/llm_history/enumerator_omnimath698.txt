[write_program]
This problem involves finding the value of k that satisfies a system of trigonometric equations with constraints. We'll approach it by:

1. Using small angle approximations to find candidate values
2. Implementing a numerical search to find k values that approximately satisfy the equations
3. Checking the sum constraint 2π = w+x+y+z

The program will:
- Iterate over possible k values
- For each k, solve for w,x,y,z using the given equations
- Check if the sum condition is approximately satisfied
- Print promising candidates
