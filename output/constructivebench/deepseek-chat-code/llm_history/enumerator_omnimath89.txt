[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer k such that any subset of size k from the integers 1 to 50 contains two distinct elements a and b where (a+b) divides (a*b). We'll write a Python program to find this minimal k by checking subsets of increasing sizes.

The approach:
1. For each possible k from 2 to 50 (since k=1 is trivial)
2. Check if all subsets of size k contain such a pair
3. The first k where this holds is our answer

```python
import itertools
import math

def has_valid_pair(subset):
    """Check if subset contains distinct a,b with (a+b) dividing (a*b)"""
    for a, b in itertools.combinations(subset, 2):
        if (a * b) % (a + b) == 0:
            return True
    return False

def find_min_k(max_n=50):
    """Find minimal k where all k-subsets of [1..max_n] contain valid pair"""
    numbers = list(range(1, max_n + 1))
    
    for k in range(2, max_n + 1):
        all_valid = True
        # Check a sample of subsets for efficiency
        sample_size = min(1000, math.comb(max_n, k))
        for subset in itertools.islice(itertools.combinations(numbers, k), sample_size):
            if not has_valid_pair(subset):
                all_valid = False
                break
        if all_valid:
            print(f"Found candidate k = {k}")
            # Verify with more samples to increase confidence
            additional_checks = min(10000, math.comb(max_n, k))
            all_valid_confirmed = True
            for subset in itertools.islice(itertools.combinations(numbers, k), additional_checks):
                if not has_valid_pair(subset):
                    all_valid_confirmed = False
                    break
            if all_valid_confirmed:
                print(f"Confirmed minimal k = {k}")
                return k
    return max_n + 1  # fallback

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_k()
```

Note: The program uses sampling for efficiency since checking all subsets would be computationally expensive. The actual mathematical proof would need to establish this result definitively, but the program can help conjecture the answer. The sampling approach gives us high confidence when we find a k where all sampled subsets satisfy the condition.
