abbrev P2002AMCB_2_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem P2002AMCB_2 (x : ℝ) : 
    (3 * x - 2) * (4 * x + 1) - ((3 * x - 2) * 4 * x) + 1 = P2002AMCB_2_answer x := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => (3 * x - 2) * (4 * x + 1) - (3 * x - 2) * 4 * x + 1
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℝ => 3 * x - 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents an equation to simplify:
   (3x-2)(4x+1) - (3x-2)*4x + 1

2. Ground Truth Answer shows the unsimplified form (same as left side)

3. Proposed Answer claims it simplifies to 3x - 1

Let's verify by expanding and simplifying:
(3x-2)(4x+1) = 12x² + 3x - 8x - 2 = 12x² - 5x - 2
(3x-2)*4x = 12x² - 8x
So the expression becomes:
(12x² - 5x - 2) - (12x² - 8x) + 1 = (12x² - 5x - 2 - 12x² + 8x) + 1 = (3x - 2) + 1 = 3x - 1

The proposed answer correctly simplifies the expression. The ground truth answer just repeats the original expression without simplification.
