[write_program]
This problem asks to find the real number x < 3 that satisfies the equation involving square roots of products of (3-x), (4-x), and (6-x). We'll write a Python program to numerically approximate the solution by testing values in the valid domain (x < 3).

The approach will be:
1. Define the equation as a function
2. Use binary search between reasonable bounds (since x must be <3)
3. Print intermediate approximations until convergence

```python
import math

def equation(x):
    term1 = math.sqrt((3 - x) * (4 - x))
    term2 = math.sqrt((4 - x) * (6 - x))
    term3 = math.sqrt((6 - x) * (3 - x))
    return term1 + term2 + term3 - x

def find_solution():
    low = 0.0
    high = 3.0
    tolerance = 1e-10
    max_iter = 100
    
    for i in range(max_iter):
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        val = equation(mid)
        
        print(f"Iteration {i+1}: x = {mid:.10f}, f(x) = {val:.10f}")
        
        if abs(val) < tolerance:
            print(f"\nConverged solution: x â‰ˆ {mid:.10f}")
            return mid
        
        if val > 0:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid
    
    print("Maximum iterations reached")
    return (low + high) / 2
