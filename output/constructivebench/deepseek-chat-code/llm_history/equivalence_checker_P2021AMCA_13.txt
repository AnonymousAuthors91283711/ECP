Ground Truth Answer: -Real.sqrt 3 + I
Proposed Answer: 2 + 0 * I
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find which complex number in the given set maximizes the real part of z⁵.

2. The ground truth answer is -√3 + i.

3. The proposed answer is 2 + 0i (which is just 2).

Let's evaluate why the ground truth is correct:
- For z = -√3 + i, z⁵ would have a significant real component because:
  * The angle is in the second quadrant (≈150°)
  * When raised to the 5th power, the angle becomes ≈750° ≡ 30° mod 360°
  * The real part of z⁵ would be positive and relatively large

For the proposed answer z = 2:
- z⁵ = 32 + 0i
- While this has a large real part (32), it's not in the set of options provided in the problem statement (the set is {z | z = -√3 + i ∨ z = -1 ∨ z = i ∨ z = √3 + i ∨ z = 2}).

However, the problem statement does include z = 2 as one of the options, and 32 is indeed larger than the real part of (-√3 + i)⁵. Therefore, the proposed answer is actually correct.
