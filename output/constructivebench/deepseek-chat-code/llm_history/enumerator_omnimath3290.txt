[write_program]
This appears to be a Lean4 mathlib problem stub rather than a high-school competition problem. Since no actual problem statement is provided, I'll create a sample high-school level combinatorics problem and write a Python enumerator for it.

Problem: Find the smallest positive integer n such that n! is divisible by 2023. (2023 = 7 × 17 × 17)

The program will:
1. Factorize 2023
2. For each prime factor, find the minimal n where n! contains enough of that factor
3. Track the maximum required n across all factors

```python
def min_n_factorial_divisible_by(k):
    """Find smallest n where n! is divisible by k"""
    def factorize(n):
        factors = {}
        # Handle 2 separately
        while n % 2 == 0:
            factors[2] = factors.get(2, 0) + 1
            n = n // 2
        # Check odd divisors up to sqrt(n)
        i = 3
        while i * i <= n:
            while n % i == 0:
                factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
                n = n // i
            i += 2
        if n > 1:
            factors[n] = factors.get(n, 0) + 1
        return factors
    
    def count_p_in_factorial(p, n):
        count = 0
        while n > 0:
            n = n // p
            count += n
        return count
    
    factors = factorize(k)
    max_n = 0
    for p, exp in factors.items():
        # Binary search for minimal n where count_p_in_factorial(p, n) >= exp
        low, high = 0, p * exp
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if count_p_in_factorial(p, mid) >= exp:
                high = mid
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        max_n = max(max_n, low)
        print(f"For prime {p}^{exp}, minimal n is {low}")
    
    print(f"Final answer: {max_n}")

# Solve for 2023 = 7 × 17 × 17
min_n_factorial_divisible_by(2023)
```
