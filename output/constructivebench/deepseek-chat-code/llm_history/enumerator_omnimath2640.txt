[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest possible rank of an n×n real matrix where diagonal entries are zero and off-diagonal entries are positive. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible ranks for small values of n to help conjecture the general pattern.

The approach:
1. For small n (1 to 5), we'll compute the minimal rank
2. The matrix constraints: M[i][j] = 0 when i=j, M[i][j]>0 when i≠j
3. We'll observe the pattern in minimal ranks for these small cases

```python
import numpy as np
from itertools import product

def check_matrix_conditions(M):
    n = M.shape[0]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i == j:
                if M[i,j] != 0:
                    return False
            else:
                if M[i,j] <= 0:
                    return False
    return True

def find_min_rank(n):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"n=1: minimal rank is 0")
        return 0
    
    # Try ranks from 1 upwards
    for r in range(1, n+1):
        # Try random matrices with the given conditions
        for _ in range(1000):  # Limited attempts for efficiency
            M = np.random.rand(n, n)
            for i in range(n):
                M[i,i] = 0  # Zero diagonal
            # Force rank r by keeping first r rows and making others linear combinations
            if r < n:
                for i in range(r, n):
                    weights = np.random.rand(r)
                    M[i,:] = np.sum(M[:r,:] * weights.reshape(-1,1), axis=0)
            # Check if all off-diagonal entries are positive
            if check_matrix_conditions(M):
                actual_rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(M)
                if actual_rank == r:
                    print(f"n={n}: found matrix with rank {r}")
                    return r
    return n  # Fallback (shouldn't reach here for small n)

for n in range(1, 6):
    find_min_rank(n)
```
