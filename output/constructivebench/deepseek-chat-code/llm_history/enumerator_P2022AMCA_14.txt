[write_program]
The problem asks to compute the value of a logarithmic expression involving a product of terms. We'll write a Python program to compute this expression numerically and output the result. The expression is:

log(product from k=0 to 8 of (1 + 2*(1/10)^(k+1))) / log(1/10)

We'll compute this step by step:
1. Calculate the product term
2. Take its natural logarithm
3. Divide by log(1/10)
4. Output the result

```python
import math

def compute_expression():
    product = 1.0
    for k in range(9):  # k from 0 to 8
        term = 1 + 2 * (1/10)**(k+1)
        product *= term
    
    numerator = math.log(product)
    denominator = math.log(1/10)
    result = numerator / denominator
    print(result)

compute_expression()
```
