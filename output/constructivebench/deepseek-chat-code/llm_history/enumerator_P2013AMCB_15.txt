This problem asks for the minimal possible absolute difference between the heads of two non-empty, non-increasing sorted lists of natural numbers whose sums add up to 2013, while also maximizing the sum of their heads. We'll approach this by:

1. Enumerating possible pairs of head values (a, b) where a â‰¥ b
2. For each pair, calculate the minimal possible sum of remaining elements (2013 - a - b)
3. Verify if this remaining sum can be distributed to complete both lists while maintaining non-increasing order
4. Track the minimal |a-b| that satisfies these conditions

```python
def main():
    target = 2013
    min_diff = float('inf')
    
    # Iterate possible a (larger head) and b (smaller head)
    for a in range(1, target):
        # The minimal remaining sum is 0 (when lists are [a] and [b])
        remaining = target - a
        if remaining < 1:
            continue
            
        # b ranges up to min(a, remaining) to keep a >= b
        max_b = min(a, remaining)
        for b in range(max_b, 0, -1):
            current_diff = a - b
            if current_diff >= min_diff:
                continue  # No need to check larger differences
                
            # Check if remaining sum (target-a-b) can be distributed
            # The minimal case is when all extra go to b's list as 1's
            # since b is the smaller head and we need non-increasing
            remaining_sum = target - a - b
            if remaining_sum >= 0:
                # Minimal condition: remaining_sum can be split into terms <= b
                # Since we can always add 1's to b's list
                min_diff = current_diff
                print(f"Found candidate: |{a}-{b}| = {current_diff}")
                break  # No need to check smaller b's for this a
    
    print(f"Minimal difference found: {min_diff}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
