This problem involves evaluating a complex expression with nested radicals and exponents. We'll compute the expression numerically to find patterns or exact values. The key is to simplify the denominator by recognizing potential telescoping patterns or exact forms.

```python
import math

def compute_denominator():
    # Compute the denominator: (sqrt(5)+1)*(5^(1/4)+1)*(5^(1/8)+1)*(5^(1/16)+1)
    sqrt5 = math.sqrt(5)
    term1 = sqrt5 + 1
    term2 = 5**(1/4) + 1
    term3 = 5**(1/8) + 1
    term4 = 5**(1/16) + 1
    return term1 * term2 * term3 * term4

def main():
    denominator = compute_denominator()
    x = 4 / denominator
    result = (x + 1)**48
    
    # Print intermediate values for verification
    print(f"Denominator: {denominator}")
    print(f"x value: {x}")
    print(f"Result: {result}")
    
    # Check for simple fractional forms
    tolerance = 1e-10
    for n in range(1, 1000):
        for d in range(1, 1000):
            if abs(result - n/d) < tolerance:
                print(f"Possible fraction: {n}/{d}")
                return
    
    print("No simple fraction found within tolerance")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
