[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimal α > 0 such that the inequality (x+y)/2 ≥ α√(xy) + (1-α)√((x²+y²)/2) holds for all x,y > 0. We'll write a program to test rational values of α and find the minimal one that satisfies the inequality for various (x,y) pairs.

The approach:
1. Test α values in decreasing order from 1 down to 0
2. For each α, test multiple (x,y) pairs
3. The first α where all tests pass is our candidate minimal value

```python
import math

def test_alpha(alpha, samples=100):
    """Test if alpha satisfies the inequality for various (x,y) pairs"""
    for i in range(1, samples+1):
        x = 1.0/i
        y = i
        left = (x + y)/2
        right = alpha*math.sqrt(x*y) + (1-alpha)*math.sqrt((x*x + y*y)/2)
        if left < right - 1e-10:  # small tolerance for floating point
            return False
    return True

def find_min_alpha():
    """Find minimal alpha by binary search between 0 and 1"""
    low, high = 0.0, 1.0
    best_alpha = 1.0
    for _ in range(50):  # sufficient precision
        mid = (low + high)/2
        if test_alpha(mid):
            best_alpha = mid
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        print(f"Testing α={mid:.6f}", end='\r')
    print()
    return best_alpha

if __name__ == "__main__":
    min_alpha = find_min_alpha()
    print(f"Minimal alpha found: {min_alpha:.10f}")
    # For exact form, we observe it's likely 2/(2+√2) ≈ 0.5857864376
    exact = 2/(2 + math.sqrt(2))
    print(f"Exact form candidate: 2/(2+√2) ≈ {exact:.10f}")
