[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimal sum s where s is the sum of a[i]/(i+1) for i from 0 to n-1, with a being a bijection (permutation) of {0,...,n-1}. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible sums for small n values to help conjecture the pattern.

The approach:
1. Generate all permutations of range(n) - these represent possible bijections a
2. For each permutation, compute the sum s = sum(a[i]/(i+1) for i in range(n))
3. Track the minimum sum found
4. Output results for n from 1 to some reasonable limit (we'll use n=8)

```python
import itertools

def find_min_sum(n):
    min_sum = float('inf')
    best_perm = None
    numbers = range(n)
    
    for perm in itertools.permutations(numbers):
        current_sum = sum(a / (i + 1) for i, a in enumerate(perm))
        if current_sum < min_sum:
            min_sum = current_sum
            best_perm = perm
            # Print immediately when new minimum found
            print(f"n={n}: new min sum {min_sum} with permutation {perm}")
    
    return min_sum

def main():
    max_n = 8  # Reasonable upper limit for enumeration
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        print(f"\nEnumerating for n={n}:")
        min_sum = find_min_sum(n)
        print(f"Final minimum sum for n={n}: {min_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
