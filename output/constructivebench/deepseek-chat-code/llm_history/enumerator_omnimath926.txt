[write_program]
This problem asks to find all real numbers x in the interval (-π/2, π/2) that satisfy the equation 1 - sin⁴x - cos²x = 1/16. We'll write a Python program to numerically search for solutions in this interval.

Approach:
1. We'll use numpy for trigonometric functions and numerical computations
2. Scan the interval (-π/2, π/2) with small steps
3. For each x, compute the left-hand side of the equation and check if it's close to 1/16 (0.0625)
4. Print any x values that satisfy the equation within a small tolerance

```python
import numpy as np

def find_solutions():
    # Define the interval and step size
    start = -np.pi/2 + 0.0001  # Avoid exact endpoints
    end = np.pi/2 - 0.0001
    step = 0.00001
    tolerance = 1e-6
    
    # Target value
    target = 1/16
    
    # Scan through the interval
    x = start
    while x < end:
        lhs = 1 - np.sin(x)**4 - np.cos(x)**2
        if abs(lhs - target) < tolerance:
            print(f"Found solution: x ≈ {x:.6f}")
            # Skip ahead to avoid duplicate solutions
            x += step * 100
        x += step

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solutions()
```
