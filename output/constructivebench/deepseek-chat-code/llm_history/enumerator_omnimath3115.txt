[write_program]
The problem asks to find the natural number `n` such that `2^n = 8^20`, and prove it's unique. We'll write a Python program to compute this value by expressing both sides with the same base (2) and comparing exponents.

Since 8 = 2^3, we can rewrite 8^20 as (2^3)^20 = 2^(3*20). Therefore, n must be 3*20 = 60. The Python program will compute this directly.

```python
# Compute n where 2^n = 8^20 by converting both sides to base 2
n = 3 * 20
print(n)
```
