Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
From the enumerated answers, we see that only k=1 has a solution (n=101). The pattern suggests that only when k=1 does the condition hold. Since 202 is even (2*101), the fractional sum condition appears to only be satisfied when k=1 with n=101 (which is 202/2).
