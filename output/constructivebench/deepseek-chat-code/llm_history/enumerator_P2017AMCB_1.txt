[write_program]
This problem is asking to find the smallest natural number `P2017AMCB_1_answer` such that the equation `10 + 6x = 2*(30 + 2x)` holds, and that for all smaller numbers, the left side is less than the right side. We can solve this by enumerating natural numbers until we find the smallest one satisfying the equation.

The equation simplifies to:
10 + 6x = 60 + 4x
2x = 50
x = 25

But since we're asked to verify this through enumeration and also check the minimality condition, we'll write a program that checks each natural number in order until it finds the solution.

```python
def check_condition(x):
    left = 10 + 6 * x
    right = 2 * (30 + 2 * x)
    return left == right

def check_minimality(x):
    for m in range(x):
        left = 10 + 6 * m
        right = 2 * (30 + 2 * m)
        if left >= right:
            return False
    return True

def find_minimal_solution():
    x = 0
    while True:
        if check_condition(x):
            print(f"Found candidate: {x}")
            if check_minimality(x):
                print(f"Minimal solution found: {x}")
                return x
        x += 1

find_minimal_solution()
```
