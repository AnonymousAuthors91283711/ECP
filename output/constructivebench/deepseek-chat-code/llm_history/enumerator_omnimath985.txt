[write_program]
This problem asks to find all integers n where n²-4 ≠ 0 and n³+8 is divisible by n²-4. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible integer solutions.

Key observations:
1. We need to check n where n²-4 divides n³+8
2. Exclude n=±2 since they make denominator zero
3. We'll check a reasonable range of integers first, then analyze patterns

```python
def solve():
    # Check a reasonable range of integers
    min_n = -20
    max_n = 20
    solutions = []
    
    for n in range(min_n, max_n + 1):
        if n**2 - 4 == 0:  # Skip n=±2
            continue
        if (n**3 + 8) % (n**2 - 4) == 0:
            solutions.append(n)
            print(f"Found solution: n = {n}")
    
    print("\nAll solutions found in range:")
    for s in sorted(solutions):
        print(s)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```
