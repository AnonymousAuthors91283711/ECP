This problem asks for the largest positive integer n such that there exists a positive integer k where k*(n+1) = 840!. We need to find the maximal n where n+1 is a proper divisor of 840!.

The approach is to find the smallest proper divisor of 840! (greater than 1), since n+1 must divide 840! and we want to maximize n (which means minimizing n+1). The smallest proper divisor of any factorial is the smallest prime number, which is 2.

Here's a Python program that verifies this by checking small divisors and showing the corresponding n values:

```python
import math

def find_max_n():
    fact_840 = math.factorial(840)
    # Check small divisors to verify the pattern
    for d in range(2, 11):
        if fact_840 % d == 0:
            n = fact_840 // d - 1
            print(f"For divisor {d}, n = {n}")
    
    # The minimal proper divisor is 2, giving maximal n
    max_n = fact_840 // 2 - 1
    print(f"\nMaximal n found: {max_n}")

find_max_n()
```
