This problem involves finding the value of `m` given three constants `b1=2, b2=3, b3=4` and their corresponding `x` values defined as `xi = -bi/m`, with the constraint that the sum of all `x` values equals 36. We'll solve this algebraically and verify with Python.

The solution approach:
1. Substitute the given `b` values into the `x` expressions
2. Sum the three equations: (-2/m) + (-3/m) + (-4/m) = 36
3. Combine terms: (-9/m) = 36
4. Solve for m: m = -9/36 = -0.25

Here's the Python program that verifies this solution:

```python
def solve_m():
    b1, b2, b3 = 2, 3, 4
    target_sum = 36
    
    # The algebraic solution
    m = -(b1 + b2 + b3) / target_sum
    
    # Verify the solution
    x1 = -b1 / m
    x2 = -b2 / m
    x3 = -b3 / m
    calculated_sum = x1 + x2 + x3
    
    print(f"Calculated m: {m}")
    print(f"Verification - sum of x's: {calculated_sum} (should equal {target_sum})")

solve_m()
```
