This problem involves calculating the area of a region in the unit square where the floor of the base-2 logarithm of both coordinates is equal. We'll approach this by enumerating the possible integer values of the floor function and calculating the corresponding areas.

The key observation is that for each integer k, the condition ⌊log₂ x⌋ = ⌊log₂ y⌋ = k defines a square region where both x and y are in [2^k, 2^{k+1}) (but also within (0,1)). Since we're working in the unit square, we only need to consider negative values of k.

```python
import math

def calculate_area():
    total_area = 0.0
    k = -1
    while True:
        lower = 2.0 ** k
        upper = 2.0 ** (k + 1)
        # Ensure we stay within (0,1) interval
        if lower >= 1:
            break
        if upper > 1:
            upper = 1
        # Area for this k is (upper - lower)^2
        area = (upper - lower) ** 2
        print(f"For k = {k}: area = {area}")
        total_area += area
        k -= 1
    
    print(f"Total area: {total_area}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    calculate_area()
```

The program calculates the area by:
1. Iterating through negative integers k (starting at -1)
2. For each k, determining the interval [2^k, 2^{k+1}) where ⌊log₂ x⌋ = k
3. Calculating the area of the square where both coordinates fall in this interval
4. Summing these areas until we exit the unit square

The output shows the contribution from each k and the running total, allowing us to observe the convergence pattern. The exact value can be recognized from the partial sums.
