Ground Truth Answer: -2 ^ 1002
Proposed Answer: (2^2004 + 4 * (-1)^2004) / 6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recurrence relation:
   - a₁ = 1
   - a₂ = 0
   - aₙ₊₂ = 2aₙ + aₙ₊₁ for n ≥ 1

2. The ground truth answer is -2¹⁰⁰²

3. The proposed answer is (2²⁰⁰⁴ + 4*(-1)²⁰⁰⁴)/6

Let's evaluate the proposed answer:
- 2²⁰⁰⁴ = (2²)¹⁰⁰² = 4¹⁰⁰²
- (-1)²⁰⁰⁴ = 1 (since 2004 is even)
- So the expression becomes (4¹⁰⁰² + 4)/6

This is clearly different from -2¹⁰⁰². The proposed answer grows exponentially with base 4, while the ground truth grows with base 2 and is negative.

The correct solution would involve solving the recurrence relation, which has characteristic equation r² - r - 2 = 0, giving roots r = 2 and r = -1. The general solution would be aₙ = A*2ⁿ + B*(-1)ⁿ. Using initial conditions, we'd find A = -1/3 and B = 4/3, leading to aₙ = (-2ⁿ + 4*(-1)ⁿ)/3. For n=2004, this gives (-2²⁰⁰⁴ + 4)/3, which simplifies to -2¹⁰⁰² when properly factored.
