This problem involves calculating the exact value of 1 divided by the product of two binomial coefficients C(13,2). The binomial coefficient C(n,k) represents the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements. 

We'll compute this exact rational value in Python by:
1. Calculating C(13,2) = 13!/(2! * 11!) = (13*12)/2 = 78
2. Then computing 1/(78 * 78) = 1/6084
3. The exact rational form is 1/6084

Here's the Python program that computes and prints this exact value:

```python
from math import comb

def main():
    # Calculate binomial coefficient C(13,2)
    c = comb(13, 2)
    # Compute the denominator (c * c)
    denominator = c * c
    # Print the exact rational form
    print(f"1/{denominator}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
