. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Looking at the pattern from n=1 to n=9, the exact values match fractions where numerator is n and denominator is n+1. For n=2016, this suggests the answer is 2016/2017. The general form would be n/(n+1).

. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
From the enumerated answers and the pattern, we can see that for n=2016, the answer should be 2016/2017. The proposed answer was trying to generalize this as n/(n+1), but the error occurred because the function was defined to return ℚ but was given a function type ℕ → ℚ instead.

The correct solution should directly give the specific value for n=2016, which is 2016/2017 as a rational number. The pattern shows this is consistent across all tested values (n/(n+1) matches exactly).

Here's the fixed answer:

<<<2016 / 2017>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem asks for a specific value (2016 case) not a general function
2. The pattern from enumerated answers shows n/(n+1) is correct
3. For n=2016, this becomes 2016/2017
4. The answer must be of type ℚ, which this satisfies
5. The error occurred because the original attempt tried to make a function when a concrete value was needed
