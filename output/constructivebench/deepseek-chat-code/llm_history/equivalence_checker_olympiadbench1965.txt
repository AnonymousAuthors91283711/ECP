Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ (a : ℤ) (b : ℤ), f = (fun x => a * x + b) ∧ a > 0 ∧ olympiadbench1965_omega a = 0}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ (a : ℕ) (b : ℤ), a ≠ 0 ∧ f = fun n => a * n + b}
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer:
   - Requires f to be linear (a*x + b)
   - Requires a > 0 (strictly increasing)
   - Requires olympiadbench1965_omega a = 0 (no prime factors > 10^100 in coefficient)

2. Proposed Answer:
   - Requires f to be linear (a*n + b)
   - Uses a : ℕ instead of ℤ, which implies a ≥ 0
   - Requires a ≠ 0 (but doesn't explicitly require a > 0)
   - Missing the critical condition about olympiadbench1965_omega a = 0

The differences are:
1. The proposed answer doesn't specify the condition about prime factors
2. While a ≠ 0 implies the function is strictly or weakly increasing (since a is ℕ), it doesn't explicitly require strict monotonicity (a > 0)
3. The ground truth uses ℤ for a while proposed uses ℕ

The missing prime factor condition is crucial, and the proposed answer doesn't guarantee strict monotonicity (since a could be 0, though it says a ≠ 0, but should be a > 0).
