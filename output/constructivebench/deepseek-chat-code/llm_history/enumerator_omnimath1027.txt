This problem involves counting the number of triples (a,b,c) where a,b,c âˆˆ {0,1,2,3,4,5} (Fin 6) that satisfy the triangle inequalities: a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a. We need to enumerate all possible triples and count those satisfying the conditions.

The Python program will:
1. Iterate through all possible triples (a,b,c) where each component is from 0 to 5
2. Check the triangle inequalities for each triple
3. Count the valid triples and compute the probability by dividing by 6^3 = 216
4. Output each valid triple found and finally the probability

```python
def main():
    count = 0
    total = 6 ** 3
    for a in range(6):
        for b in range(6):
            for c in range(6):
                if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:
                    print(f"Valid triple: ({a}, {b}, {c})")
                    count += 1
    probability = count / total
    print(f"\nTotal valid triples: {count}")
    print(f"Probability: {probability}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
