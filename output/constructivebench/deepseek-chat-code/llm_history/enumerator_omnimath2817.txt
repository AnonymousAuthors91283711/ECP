The problem is to find the real value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 10^x \cdot 10^5 = 100^4 \). We can simplify this equation using exponent rules to find the exact value of \( x \). The Python program will compute and print the exact value of \( x \).

```python
# The equation is 10^x * 10^5 = 100^4. Simplify using exponent rules:
# 10^(x + 5) = (10^2)^4 => 10^(x + 5) = 10^8 => x + 5 = 8 => x = 3
# The exact solution is x = 3.

print(3)
```
