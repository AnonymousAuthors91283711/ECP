[write_program]
This problem involves finding all integers `k` such that there exists an infinite set of natural numbers `s` where for every `n` in `s`, `n + k` does not divide the central binomial coefficient `C(2n, n)`. 

To approach this, we'll:
1. Enumerate small integer values of k
2. For each k, check small values of n to see if n+k divides C(2n,n)
3. Look for patterns where n+k never divides C(2n,n) for infinitely many n

The program will test small k values and print those where we find many consecutive n where n+k doesn't divide C(2n,n), suggesting they might be in the answer set.

```python
import math

def central_binom(n):
    return math.comb(2*n, n)

def test_k(k, max_n=20):
    """Test if n+k doesn't divide C(2n,n) for many small n"""
    results = []
    for n in range(1, max_n+1):
        c = central_binom(n)
        d = n + k
        if d != 0 and c % d == 0:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    print("Testing small integer k values:")
    # Test k from -10 to 10
    for k in range(-10, 11):
        if test_k(k):
            print(f"Potential candidate: k = {k}")
    
    print("\nTesting more negative k values:")
    for k in range(-20, -10):
        if test_k(k):
            print(f"Potential candidate: k = {k}")
    
    print("\nTesting more positive k values:")
    for k in range(11, 21):
        if test_k(k):
            print(f"Potential candidate: k = {k}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
