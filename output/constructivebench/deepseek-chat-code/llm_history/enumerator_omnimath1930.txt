This problem involves finding the minimum of two linear functions and expressing it in terms of absolute values. We need to find coefficients a, b, c, d such that min(20x + 19, 19x + 20) = (a*x + b) - |c*x + d| for all x, then compute a*b + c*d.

The key observation is that the minimum of two lines can be expressed using their average and half-difference. The intersection point occurs at x=1 where both functions equal 39.

```python
def main():
    # The two linear functions
    def f1(x): return 20*x + 19
    def f2(x): return 19*x + 20
    
    # The intersection point is at x=1
    # The general form is (average) - (half difference)
    # So a = (20+19)/2 = 19.5
    # b = (19+20)/2 = 19.5
    # c = (20-19)/2 = 0.5
    # d = (19-20)/2 = -0.5
    
    a = 19.5
    b = 19.5
    c = 0.5
    d = -0.5
    
    # Verify at several points
    test_points = [-10, 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 10]
    for x in test_points:
        actual_min = min(f1(x), f2(x))
        computed = (a*x + b) - abs(c*x + d)
        print(f"x={x}: actual={actual_min}, computed={computed}")
    
    # Calculate the required expression
    result = a*b + c*d
    print(f"\na*b + c*d = {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
