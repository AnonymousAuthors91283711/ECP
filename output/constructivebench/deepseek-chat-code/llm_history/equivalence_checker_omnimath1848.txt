Ground Truth Answer: 2017 / 1008
Proposed Answer: (1 / (1 - 1/2)) * (1 / (1 - 1/2017))
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about summing the reciprocals of all natural numbers whose prime factors are only 2 and 2017. This is essentially describing numbers of the form 2^a * 2017^b where a,b ≥ 0 (but s > 0).

2. The ground truth answer is 2017/1008.

3. The proposed answer is (1/(1-1/2)) * (1/(1-1/2017)).

Let's evaluate the proposed answer:
- (1/(1-1/2)) = 2
- (1/(1-1/2017)) = 2017/2016
- Their product is 2 * 2017/2016 = 2017/1008

This exactly matches the ground truth answer of 2017/1008. The proposed answer is just an expanded form of the same value.
