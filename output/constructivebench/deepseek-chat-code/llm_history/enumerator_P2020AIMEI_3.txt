This problem involves finding the smallest positive integer N that can be expressed in two different bases (8 and 11) with specific digit constraints. We'll enumerate all possible combinations of digits a, b, c under the given constraints and check for numbers that satisfy both representations.

The constraints are:
- In base 11: N = a*11² + b*11 + c where a < 11, b < 11, c < 11
- In base 8: N = 1*8³ + b*8² + c*8 + a where a < 8, b < 8, c < 8
- Additionally, a < 8, b < 8, c < 8 (implied by base 8 representation)

We'll iterate through all possible a, b, c values and check for matches between the two representations.

```python
def find_min_N():
    min_N = None
    # Iterate through all possible a, b, c values (a < 8, b < 8, c < 8)
    for a in range(1, 8):  # a cannot be 0 in base 11 representation
        for b in range(8):
            for c in range(8):
                # Calculate N in base 11
                N_base11 = a * 121 + b * 11 + c
                # Calculate N in base 8
                N_base8 = 512 + b * 64 + c * 8 + a
                # Check if both representations give same N
                if N_base11 == N_base8:
                    print(f"Found N={N_base11} with a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
                    if min_N is None or N_base11 < min_N:
                        min_N = N_base11
    if min_N is not None:
        print(f"Minimum N found: {min_N}")
    else:
        print("No solution found")

find_min_N()
```
