Ground Truth Answer: univ
Proposed Answer: {0} ∪ {x : ℤ | ∃ (k m : ℕ), 0 < m ∧ (x = 2^k * (2^m - 1) ∨ x = -(2^k * (2^m - 1)))}
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer (univ) and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer claims that S must be all integers (univ), while the proposed answer suggests S is the set of all integers that are either:
1. Zero, or
2. Plus or minus a power of 2 multiplied by (2^m - 1) where m > 0

The proposed answer is a proper subset of univ (the ground truth). For example, the integer 3 is in univ but cannot be expressed in the form proposed (since 3 is not a multiple of any (2^m - 1) for m > 0). 

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent. The proposed answer is too restrictive compared to the ground truth.
