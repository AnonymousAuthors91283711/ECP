Total integer terms found: 5. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the enumerated answers (16, 24, 36, 54, 81) and the geometric sequence pattern, we observe each term is multiplied by 1.5 (24/16=1.5, 36/24=1.5, etc.). The general form appears to be 16*(3/2)^n, but since we need integer values, n must be even to cancel denominators. The answer counts these integer terms.
