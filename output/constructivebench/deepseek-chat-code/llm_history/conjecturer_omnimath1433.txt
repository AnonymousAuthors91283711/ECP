theorem omnimath1433 : 
  Fintype.card {f : Fin 10 → Fin 3 // ∀ (a b : Fin 10), 
    Odd (a.val - b.val) → f a ≠ f b} = omnimath1433_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Total valid functions: 2304
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<6 * 4^9>>> 

Explanation: The problem counts functions from Fin 10 to Fin 3 where any two inputs with odd difference must map to different outputs. The enumerated answer 2304 factors as 6*4^9. This suggests:
- 6 choices for f(0) (all 3 colors) and f(1) (remaining 2 colors)
- For each subsequent even position (2,4,...), 4 choices (since it must differ from f(1), f(3), etc.)
- For each odd position (3,5,...), 4 choices (must differ from f(0), f(2), etc.)
The pattern generalizes to 6*4^9.
