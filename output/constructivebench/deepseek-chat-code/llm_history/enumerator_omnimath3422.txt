[write_program]
This problem asks to find which of the given equations n² = k^m (for specific (k,m) pairs) have natural number solutions n, and to express this as a single equation n² = answer. We'll write a Python program to check each case and find the valid solutions.

```python
def check_solutions():
    # List of (k, m) pairs to check
    cases = [
        (2, 3),
        (3, 5),
        (4, 7),
        (5, 9),
        (6, 11)
    ]
    
    valid = []
    
    for k, m in cases:
        rhs = k ** m
        n = int(rhs ** 0.5)
        if n * n == rhs:
            print(f"Found solution: n={n} for {k}^{m} = {rhs}")
            valid.append(rhs)
        else:
            print(f"No solution for {k}^{m} = {rhs}")
    
    if valid:
        print("Valid right-hand sides found:", valid)
    else:
        print("No solutions found")

check_solutions()
```
