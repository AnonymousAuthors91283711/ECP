[write_program]
This appears to be a simple algebraic problem where we need to simplify the expression 4*x^2 - 3*x^2 when x=2. The solution can be found by direct computation. Here's a Python program that computes this:

```python
def compute_expression(x):
    return 4 * x**2 - 3 * x**2

x = 2
result = compute_expression(x)
print(f"For x = {x}, 4x² - 3x² = {result}")
```

The program simply:
1. Defines a function to compute the expression
2. Sets x = 2 as given in the problem
3. Computes and prints the result

The output will show that when x=2, the expression evaluates to 4.
