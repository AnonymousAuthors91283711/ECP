<<<3600>>> 

Explanation: The problem describes two arithmetic progressions whose products form a system of equations. The pattern suggests looking for factors of 1440 that satisfy the subsequent conditions. The final term (n=7) likely results in 3600 based on the progression pattern and factorization constraints.
