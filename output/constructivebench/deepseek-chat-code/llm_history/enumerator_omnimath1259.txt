This problem involves finding the maximum value of a nested polynomial evaluation under certain constraints. We'll approach it by:
1. Modeling the polynomial relationship
2. Enumerating possible polynomial degrees
3. Solving the resulting equations for each case
4. Tracking the maximum value found

The key insight is that the polynomial must satisfy a functional equation, which severely restricts possible forms. We'll check low-degree polynomials first since higher degrees likely won't satisfy the constraints.
