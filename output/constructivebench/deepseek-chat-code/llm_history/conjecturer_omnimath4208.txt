theorem omnimath4208 (f : ℤ → ℤ) : 
  (∀ n, n^2 + 4 * f n = (f (f n))^2) ↔ f ∈ omnimath4208_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing constant functions:

Testing linear functions:
Found linear solution: f(n) = 1n + 1

Testing quadratic functions:
Found quadratic solution: f(n) = 0n² + 1n + 1

Testing piecewise functions:. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ → ℤ)
Based on the enumerated answers and the functional equation n² + 4*f(n) = (f(f(n)))², the solution appears to be the constant function f(n) = n + 1. The quadratic test confirms this as the coefficient for n² is 0, leaving just the linear term.
