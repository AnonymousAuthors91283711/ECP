[write_program]
This problem asks for the angle θ (in degrees) between 0 and 90 that satisfies the equation cos(60°) = cos(45°) * cos(θ). We'll write a Python program to numerically approximate θ by testing values in small increments and finding where the equation holds.

The approach:
1. Convert degrees to radians for trigonometric functions
2. Iterate θ from 0 to 90 degrees in small steps
3. For each θ, compute both sides of the equation
4. Find θ where the difference between sides is minimized
5. Output candidates that come close to satisfying the equation

```python
import math

def find_theta():
    # Constants in radians
    cos60 = math.cos(math.radians(60))
    cos45 = math.cos(math.radians(45))
    
    best_theta = 0
    min_diff = float('inf')
    step = 0.0001  # Small step for precision
    
    # Iterate from 0 to 90 degrees
    theta_deg = 0.0
    while theta_deg <= 90:
        theta_rad = math.radians(theta_deg)
        rhs = cos45 * math.cos(theta_rad)
        diff = abs(cos60 - rhs)
        
        # Print if very close to solution
        if diff < 1e-6:
            print(f"Possible solution: θ = {theta_deg:.6f}°")
        
        # Track best candidate
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            best_theta = theta_deg
        
        theta_deg += step
    
    print(f"\nBest approximation: θ = {best_theta:.6f}°")

find_theta()
```
