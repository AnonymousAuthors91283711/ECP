This problem involves finding the smallest positive integer d (for a given n>0) that cannot be expressed as a sum of terms of the form (-1)^a * 2^b where a and b are natural numbers (for each index i from 1 to n). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible d values for small n and check which ones cannot be represented in this form.

The approach will:
1. For small n values (1-4), generate all possible combinations of a and b within reasonable bounds
2. For each combination, compute the sum of (-1)^a * 2^b terms
3. Track which d values appear
4. Find the smallest missing positive d

```python
import itertools

def find_min_missing_d(n, max_b=8):
    possible_d = set()
    # Generate all possible combinations of a and b for each position
    for a_list in itertools.product([0,1], repeat=n):
        for b_list in itertools.product(range(max_b), repeat=n):
            total = 0
            for a, b in zip(a_list, b_list):
                total += ((-1)**a) * (2**b)
            if total > 0:
                possible_d.add(total)
    
    # Find the smallest positive integer not in possible_d
    d = 1
    while d in possible_d:
        d += 1
    return d

# Test for small n values
for n in range(1, 5):
    min_d = find_min_missing_d(n)
    print(f"For n={n}, smallest missing d is {min_d}")
```
