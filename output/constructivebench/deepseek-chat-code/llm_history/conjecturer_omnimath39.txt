Explanation: The problem asks for positive integers 'a' where a 6-element set X of integers exists such that for every k from 1 to 36, there are x,y in X with 37 dividing a*x + y - k. The only solution is a=37, as it makes the equation x + y ≡ k mod 37, which is achievable with a complete residue system modulo 37 when |X|=6 (since 6*6=36 covers all residues).
