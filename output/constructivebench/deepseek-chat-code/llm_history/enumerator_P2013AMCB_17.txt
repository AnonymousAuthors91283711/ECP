This problem asks for the difference between the supremum and infimum of all real numbers c such that there exist real numbers a, b satisfying:
1. a + b = 2 - c
2. a² + b² = 12 - c²

We'll approach this by:
1. Using the relationship between sum and sum of squares (a² + b² = (a+b)² - 2ab)
2. Substituting the given equations to find constraints on c
3. Solving the resulting quadratic inequality to find valid c values
4. Calculating the difference between max and min valid c values

```python
import math

def solve():
    # We'll find all c where the system has real solutions for a,b
    # From a+b=2-c and a²+b²=12-c², we get:
    # (2-c)² - 2ab = 12 - c²
    # => 4 -4c + c² -2ab = 12 - c²
    # => 2c² -4c -8 = 2ab
    # => ab = c² -2c -4
    
    # For real a,b to exist, discriminant must be non-negative:
    # (a+b)² -4ab ≥0
    # (2-c)² -4(c²-2c-4) ≥0
    # 4-4c+c² -4c²+8c+16 ≥0
    # -3c² +4c +20 ≥0
    # 3c² -4c -20 ≤0
    
    # Find roots of 3c²-4c-20=0
    discriminant = 16 - 4*3*(-20)
    c1 = (4 - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*3)
    c2 = (4 + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*3)
    
    # The inequality holds between the roots
    print(f"Valid c range: [{c1:.6f}, {c2:.6f}]")
    print(f"Difference: {c2 - c1:.6f}")
