Looking at the enumerated answers, we can see they are all cyclic permutations of the base sequence [1,1,4,2,3,2,4,3]. The problem requires:
1. Each number 1-4 appears exactly twice
2. For any two equal numbers, their indices' difference equals the number

The error in the proposed answer comes from incorrect syntax for defining a set in Lean. We need to properly construct the set of all cyclic permutations using Fin 8 → ℤ functions.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<{f : Fin 8 → ℤ | ∃ k : Fin 8, ∀ i : Fin 8, f i = ![1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3] ((i + k) % 8)}>>>

Explanation:
1. We define the set of functions f where f is a cyclic shift of the base sequence
2. The base sequence is represented using Lean's ![] notation for vectors
3. The cyclic shift is achieved by adding k (mod 8) to each index
4. The modulo operation ensures we stay within Fin 8 bounds
5. This captures all 6 enumerated solutions through different k values

The answer satisfies both conditions:
- Each number appears exactly twice due to the base sequence's construction
- The index difference condition holds because of the specific spacing in the base sequence (e.g., the 1's are 1 apart, 4's are 4 apart, etc.) which is preserved under cyclic shifts[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the enumerated answers, we can see they are all cyclic permutations of the base sequence [1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3]. The problem requires:
1. Each number 1-4 appears exactly twice
2. If two positions have same value, their distance equals that value

The proposed answer needs to capture all cyclic shifts of this base sequence. The error in the current proposal is due to incorrect syntax for defining a set. Here's the corrected version:

<<<{f : Fin 8 → ℤ | ∃ k : Fin 8, ∀ i : Fin 8, f i = ![1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3] ((i + k) % 8)}>>>

Explanation:
1. The set contains all functions f: Fin 8 → ℤ
2. Each f is a cyclic shift of the base sequence [1,1,4,2,3,2,4,3]
3. The shift is controlled by k, which rotates the sequence by k positions
4. The modulo operation ensures we stay within Fin 8 bounds
5. This matches all enumerated answers which are exactly the 6 distinct rotations of the base sequence

The answer satisfies both conditions:
- Each value 1-4 appears exactly twice (by construction)
- The distance condition holds because the sequence was carefully constructed to maintain this property under rotation[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
