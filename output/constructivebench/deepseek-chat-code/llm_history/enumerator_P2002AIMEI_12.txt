[write_program]
This problem involves iterating a complex function and finding the real and imaginary parts after 2002 iterations. We'll write a Python program to simulate the iterations and observe patterns.

Key observations:
1. The function F(z) is a Möbius transformation
2. We need to track the real and imaginary parts through iterations
3. The initial condition is z₀ = 1/137 + i

We'll implement the iteration and print the results for smaller numbers of iterations to observe convergence patterns.

```python
import cmath

def F(z):
    if z == 1j:  # Handle the singularity case
        return float('inf')
    return (z + 1j) / (z - 1j)

def simulate_iterations(max_iter=20):
    z = (1/137) + 1j
    print(f"Initial z: {z}")
    
    for n in range(1, max_iter + 1):
        z = F(z)
        a, b = z.real, z.imag
        print(f"Iteration {n}: a = {a:.15f}, b = {b:.15f}, a+b = {a+b:.15f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    simulate_iterations()
```
