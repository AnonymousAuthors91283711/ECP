Final sum: -2004002. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern, the final sum for n=2000 is -2004002, which suggests the general formula is related to -(n+1)(n+2)/2 when n is even. For n=2000, this gives -2001*2002/2 = -2003001, but our actual sum is -2004002. The difference is 1001, which is (n+2)/2. So the correct formula appears to be:

<<<1001>>> 

However, looking back at smaller cases:
- n=0: 1 (but sum was -2)
- n=1: 1 (sum was 4)
This doesn't match. Alternative observation: The final sum when n=2000 is -2004002 = -2*(1001^2). Since 1001 = 2001/2 + 0.5, the general formula seems to be -2*((n+1)/2)^2 when n is odd. For n=2000 (even), we see -2*(1001)^2. Thus the answer is:

<<<1001>>> 

But since the expected type is ℕ and the sum is negative, perhaps we should return the absolute value. The exact pattern isn't perfectly clear, but the key is that for n=2000, the sum is -2*1001^2, so the magnitude is 1001.
