This problem involves calculating the probability that both Rachel and Robert's positions (modulo their respective periods) are within 1/8 of 1/2 during a time interval [600,660]. We'll simulate this by checking discrete time points with sufficient granularity to approximate the continuous case.

```python
import math

def main():
    # Parameters
    t_start = 600
    t_end = 660
    total_time = t_end - t_start
    granularity = 100000  # Number of samples for approximation
    count = 0

    # Rachel's period: 90, Robert's period: 80
    for i in range(granularity + 1):
        t = t_start + (t_end - t_start) * i / granularity
        
        # Calculate fractional parts
        rachel_frac = math.modf(t / 90)[0]
        robert_frac = math.modf(t / 80)[0]
        robert_pos = 1 - robert_frac  # Robert's position is 1 - fractional part
        
        # Check if both are within [3/8, 5/8]
        if abs(rachel_frac - 0.5) <= 0.125 and abs(robert_pos - 0.5) <= 0.125:
            count += 1
    
    # Calculate probability
    probability = count / granularity
    print(f"Approximate probability: {probability}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
