The problem is to find the last two digits of \(1032^{1032}\), i.e., \(1032^{1032} \mod 100\). We can simplify this using properties of modular arithmetic. Note that \(1032 \mod 100 = 32\), so the problem reduces to finding \(32^{1032} \mod 100\). 

We can further break this down using the Chinese Remainder Theorem by computing \(32^{1032} \mod 4\) and \(32^{1032} \mod 25\) separately, then combining the results.

1. \(32^{1032} \mod 4\): Since \(32 \equiv 0 \mod 4\), \(32^{1032} \equiv 0 \mod 4\).
2. \(32^{1032} \mod 25\): We can use Euler's theorem. Since \(\phi(25) = 20\), and \(\gcd(32, 25) = 1\), \(32^{20} \equiv 1 \mod 25\). Thus, \(32^{1032} = 32^{20 \times 51 + 12} \equiv 32^{12} \mod 25\). We can compute \(32^{12} \mod 25\) by repeated squaring.

Finally, we combine the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find a number \(x\) such that \(x \equiv 0 \mod 4\) and \(x \equiv 32^{12} \mod 25\).

Here's a Python program to compute this:

```python
def compute_last_two_digits():
    # Compute 32^1032 mod 100
    # Step 1: Compute 32^1032 mod 4
    mod4 = 0  # 32 ≡ 0 mod 4
    
    # Step 2: Compute 32^1032 mod 25
    # Since ϕ(25)=20 and gcd(32,25)=1, 32^20 ≡ 1 mod 25
    # So 32^1032 = 32^(20*51 + 12) ≡ 32^12 mod 25
    exponent = 1032
    reduced_exp = exponent % 20  # Euler's theorem: 32^20 ≡ 1 mod 25
    if reduced_exp == 0:
        reduced_exp = 20  # To handle cases where exponent is a multiple of 20
    
    # Compute 32^reduced_exp mod 25
    base = 32 % 25  # 32 ≡ 7 mod 25
    mod25 = pow(base, reduced_exp, 25)
    
    # Step 3: Combine using CRT to find x ≡ 0 mod 4 and x ≡ mod25 mod 25
    # We need x ≡ mod25 mod 25 and x ≡ 0 mod 4
    # Iterate through possible values of x = mod25 + 25*k until x ≡ 0 mod 4
    x = mod25
    while x % 4 != 0:
        x += 25
    print(x)

compute_last_two_digits()
```

The program outputs the last two digits of \(1032^{1032}\) by leveraging modular arithmetic and the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The result is computed efficiently without brute-force exponentiation.
