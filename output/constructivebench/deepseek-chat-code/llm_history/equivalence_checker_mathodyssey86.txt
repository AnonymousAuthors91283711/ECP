Ground Truth Answer: 4/3
Proposed Answer: 1 / Real.sqrt 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest lower bound (infimum) of a certain set involving sequences a and b with specific properties.

2. The ground truth answer is 4/3 ≈ 1.333...

3. The proposed answer is 1/√2 ≈ 0.707...

4. The proposed answer is significantly smaller than the ground truth answer (0.707 < 1.333).

5. The problem involves sequences where a_i/b_i are distinct fractions between 0 and 1, with b_i always even.

6. The ground truth answer 4/3 comes from considering specific sequences that achieve this bound, while the proposed answer doesn't match known results for this type of problem.

Since the proposed answer is clearly different from and smaller than the ground truth answer, they are not equivalent.
