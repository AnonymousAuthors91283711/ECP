abbrev omnimath275_answer : Set (ℝ → ℝ) := sorry
theorem omnimath275 (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
  (∀ x y : ℝ, f (x + y) = f x + f y) ↔ f ∈ omnimath275_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing linear functions f(x) = kx:
Found solution: f(x) = -2x
Found solution: f(x) = -1x
Found solution: f(x) = 0x
Found solution: f(x) = 1x
Found solution: f(x) = 2x
