This problem asks for the smallest absolute value of a polynomial evaluated at 0, given its values at -10 and 9. We'll approach it by:
1. Finding all polynomials that satisfy P(-10)=145 and P(9)=164
2. Evaluating them at 0 and finding the minimal absolute value

We'll use Lagrange interpolation to find the general form of such polynomials, then search for the minimal |P(0)|.

```python
def find_min_abs_p0():
    # Points given: (-10,145) and (9,164)
    # General form: P(x) = (164-145)/(9-(-10))*(x+10) + 145 + (x+10)(x-9)*Q(x)
    # Simplified: P(x) = (19/19)(x+10) + 145 + (x+10)(x-9)Q(x) = x + 10 + 145 + (x² + x - 90)Q(x)
    # So P(x) = x + 155 + (x² + x - 90)Q(x)
    
    # We need to find Q(x) (possibly zero) that minimizes |P(0)| = |155 - 90*Q(0)|
    # So we need to find integer Q(0) that minimizes |155 - 90k| for k ∈ ℤ
    
    min_abs = float('inf')
    best_k = None
    
    # Search reasonable range of k values
    for k in range(-2, 3):
        current_abs = abs(155 - 90 * k)
        print(f"Testing Q(0)={k}: |P(0)|={current_abs}")
        if current_abs < min_abs:
            min_abs = current_abs
            best_k = k
    
    print(f"\nMinimal |P(0)| is {min_abs} achieved when Q(0)={best_k}")
