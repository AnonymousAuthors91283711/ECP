[write_program]
This problem asks to find a unique natural number `n` such that:
1. The sum of three consecutive numbers starting from `n` equals 27
2. The product of these three numbers equals some answer (which we need to find)

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of `n` and check these conditions. The sum condition simplifies to 3n + 3 = 27 ⇒ n = 8, so we only need to verify this single case.

```python
def solve():
    # Check the condition n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 27
    # Simplified to 3n + 3 = 27 ⇒ n = 8
    n = 8
    sum_condition = n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) == 27
    product = n * (n + 1) * (n + 2)
    
    if sum_condition:
        print(f"n = {n} satisfies the sum condition")
        print(f"The product is {product}")

solve()
```
