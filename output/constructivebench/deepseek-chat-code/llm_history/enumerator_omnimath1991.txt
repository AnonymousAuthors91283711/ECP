The problem appears to be calculating the probability of a specific permutation (desired_sequences = 1) out of all possible permutations of 7 distinct elements (7! = 5040). The desired probability is 1/5040.

Here's a Python program that calculates this probability exactly as a fraction:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def calculate_probability():
    total_permutations = 1
    for i in range(1, 8):  # Calculate 7! (7 factorial)
        total_permutations *= i
    desired_permutations = 1
    probability = Fraction(desired_permutations, total_permutations)
    print(f"The exact probability is: {probability}")

calculate_probability()
```
