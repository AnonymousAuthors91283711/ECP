Based on the enumerated answers, the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of three cubes in two distinct ways is 251. The two distinct representations are (1,5,5) and (2,3,6). This matches the pattern shown in the data where 251 is the first number listed with two distinct cube sum representations.
