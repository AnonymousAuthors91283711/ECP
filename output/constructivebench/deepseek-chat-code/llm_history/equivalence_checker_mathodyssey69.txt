Ground Truth Answer: (√6 - √2) / 2
Proposed Answer: Real.sqrt (2 - Real.sqrt 3)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

First, let's compute the numerical values:
1. Ground truth: (√6 - √2)/2 ≈ (2.4495 - 1.4142)/2 ≈ 0.5176
2. Proposed answer: √(2 - √3) ≈ √(2 - 1.73205) ≈ √0.26795 ≈ 0.5176

The numerical values match, but let's check if they are algebraically equivalent.

We can square the proposed answer:
(√(2 - √3))² = 2 - √3

Now square the ground truth answer:
[(√6 - √2)/2]² = (6 + 2 - 2√12)/4 = (8 - 4√3)/4 = 2 - √3

Since both expressions square to the same value (2 - √3) and both represent positive quantities (as norms are non-negative), they are indeed equivalent expressions.
