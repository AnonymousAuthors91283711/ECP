open Set

abbrev omnimath3504_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3504 (x : ℝ) : 
  x / 2 < x^2 ∧ x^2 < x ↔ x ∈ omnimath3504_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {x | x / 2 < x^2 ∧ x^2 < x}
Proposed Answer: Ioo (1/2) 1
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The ground truth answer is the set of all real numbers x where x/2 < x² and x² < x.

2. The proposed answer is the open interval (1/2, 1).

3. Let's solve the inequalities:
   - x/2 < x² → x(2x-1) > 0 → x < 0 or x > 1/2
   - x² < x → x(x-1) < 0 → 0 < x < 1

4. The intersection of these conditions gives:
   - From first inequality: x < 0 or x > 1/2
   - From second inequality: 0 < x < 1
   - Combined: 1/2 < x < 1 (since x must satisfy both)

5. The proposed answer Ioo (1/2) 1 exactly matches this solution.
