[write_program]
This problem asks to find all triples (x, y, p) where p is prime and p^x - y^p = 1. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible solutions for small values of x, y, and p.

The approach:
1. Iterate through small prime numbers p
2. For each p, iterate through reasonable x values
3. For each (p,x), compute y^p = p^x - 1 and check if y is an integer
4. Output valid triples (x, y, p)

We'll limit the search to p < 20 and x < 20 for practicality.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]:
        if n % p == 0:
            return n == p
    return True  # Assuming n < 20^2

def find_solutions():
    max_p = 20
    max_x = 20
    primes = [p for p in range(2, max_p) if is_prime(p)]
    
    for p in primes:
        for x in range(1, max_x):
            rhs = p**x - 1
            if rhs <= 0:
                continue
            # Find y such that y^p = rhs
            y = round(rhs ** (1/p))
            # Check nearby integers due to floating point inaccuracy
            for delta in [-1, 0, 1]:
                test_y = y + delta
                if test_y < 1:
                    continue
                if test_y**p == rhs:
                    print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={test_y}, p={p}")
                    break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solutions()
```
