This problem involves finding the initial point S₀ such that applying the transformation P six times results in (-7, -1). The transformation P is defined as P(x,y) = (-x, -(y-2)). We'll write a Python program to reverse-engineer the transformation and find possible candidates for S₀.

The approach is to:
1. Work backwards by applying the inverse transformation 6 times
2. The inverse of P is P⁻¹(x,y) = (-x, 2-y)
3. Start from (-7,-1) and apply P⁻¹ repeatedly to find possible S₀ values

```python
def inverse_p(point):
    x, y = point
    return (-x, 2 - y)

def find_initial_point(target, iterations):
    current = target
    for _ in range(iterations):
        current = inverse_p(current)
    return current

# Target point and number of iterations
target_point = (-7, -1)
iterations = 6

# Calculate the initial point
initial_point = find_initial_point(target_point, iterations)
print(f"Possible initial point: {initial_point}")
```

The program outputs the initial point that, when transformed 6 times, results in (-7, -1). The transformation is deterministic, so there's exactly one solution. The program efficiently computes this by working backwards through the inverse transformations.

Note: The output will be the exact integer coordinates of the initial point, which can then be verified by applying the forward transformation 6 times.
