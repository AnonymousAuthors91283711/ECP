[write_program]
This problem involves finding the minimal number of operations (n) to reach a count of at least 2018 using a specific sequence of operations (0 and 1). Operation 0 copies the current count to clipboard, and operation 1 adds the clipboard to the count. The sequence must satisfy that every operation 1 must be preceded by an operation 0 at some earlier point.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible sequences and find the minimal n that satisfies the conditions.

```python
def find_min_operations():
    target = 2018
    # We'll use BFS to explore states (clipboard, count, sequence_length)
    from collections import deque
    queue = deque()
    queue.append((0, 1, 0))  # (clipboard, count, length)
    visited = set()
    visited.add((0, 1))
    
    while queue:
        clipboard, count, length = queue.popleft()
        
        if count >= target:
            print(f"Found solution with length {length}")
            return length
        
        # Operation 0: Copy count to clipboard
        new_clip = count
        new_count = count
        new_len = length + 1
        if (new_clip, new_count) not in visited:
            visited.add((new_clip, new_count))
            queue.append((new_clip, new_count, new_len))
        
        # Operation 1: Add clipboard to count (only if clipboard > 0)
        if clipboard > 0:
            new_clip = clipboard
            new_count = count + clipboard
            new_len = length + 1
            if (new_clip, new_count) not in visited:
                visited.add((new_clip, new_count))
                queue.append((new_clip, new_count, new_len))

    find_min_operations()
