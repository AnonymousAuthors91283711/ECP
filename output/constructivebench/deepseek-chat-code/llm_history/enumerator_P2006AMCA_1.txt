[write_program]
The problem appears to be a simple arithmetic calculation (3*5 + 2*8) from a math competition. The answer should be straightforward to compute. Here's a Python program that calculates and prints the result:

```python
# Calculate 3*5 + 2*8 and print the result
result = 3 * 5 + 2 * 8
print(result)
```

The program simply computes the arithmetic expression and prints the result, which is 31 (3*5=15, 2*8=16, 15+16=31). This matches the format requested - it's a simple computation that doesn't require enumeration or approximation.
