[write_program]
This problem asks to find all 4-element sets of positive integers that maximize the number of pairs (a,b) where a < b and a+b divides the sum of all elements in the set. We'll write a Python program to enumerate small cases and identify patterns.

The approach:
1. Generate all 4-element subsets of positive integers up to a reasonable limit
2. For each subset, calculate the sum and count qualifying pairs
3. Track the maximum count found and corresponding subsets

```python
from itertools import combinations

def solve():
    max_n = 20  # Upper bound for elements to consider
    max_count = 0
    best_sets = []
    
    for subset in combinations(range(1, max_n+1), 4):
        s = sum(subset)
        count = 0
        # Check all pairs (a,b) where a < b
        for i in range(3):
            for j in range(i+1, 4):
                a, b = subset[i], subset[j]
                if s % (a + b) == 0:
                    count += 1
        
        if count > max_count:
            max_count = count
            best_sets = [subset]
        elif count == max_count:
            best_sets.append(subset)
    
    print(f"Maximum count: {max_count}")
    print("Achieving sets:")
    for s in sorted(best_sets):
        print(s)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```
