[write_program]
This problem involves finding the greatest length of consecutive terms divisible by `m` in a sequence defined by initial powers of 2 and a recurrence relation. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values for small `m` to help conjecture the pattern.

The program will:
1. Define the sequence generator based on the given recurrence
2. For small values of m (2 through 5), compute the sequence
3. Track runs of terms divisible by m
4. Output the maximum run lengths observed

```python
def compute_sequence(m, max_terms=100):
    """Generate the sequence x_n according to the problem's rules"""
    x = [1]  # x[0] = 2^0 = 1
    if m == 1:
        return x
    x.append(2)  # x[1] = 2^1 = 2
    for i in range(2, max_terms):
        if i < m:
            x.append(2 ** i)
        else:
            # Sum of previous m terms
            x.append(sum(x[i-j] for j in range(1, m+1)))
    return x

def find_max_divisible_run(m, sequence):
    """Find the longest run of terms divisible by m"""
    max_run = 0
    current_run = 0
    for term in sequence:
        if term % m == 0:
            current_run += 1
            if current_run > max_run:
                max_run = current_run
        else:
            current_run = 0
    return max_run

def main():
    for m in range(2, 6):  # Test m from 2 to 5
        seq = compute_sequence(m)
        max_run = find_max_divisible_run(m, seq)
        print(f"m={m}: sequence={seq[:20]}... (max divisible run={max_run})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
