[write_program]
This appears to be a Lean4 math problem (from the American Mathematics Competitions) asking to prove some property P2020AMCB_6_answer for all natural numbers n ≥ 9. Since we need to write a Python enumerator to help conjecture the pattern, I'll:

1. Assume the property involves finding some function of n (like divisors, digits, etc.)
2. Enumerate small values of n ≥ 9 to observe patterns
3. Print both n and the computed property value
4. Since the exact property isn't specified, I'll demonstrate with a common competition pattern - counting numbers with certain digit properties

Here's a Python program that enumerates numbers starting from 9 and counts how many numbers ≤ n have all odd digits (a common competition problem pattern):

```python
def has_all_odd_digits(x):
    while x > 0:
        d = x % 10
        if d % 2 == 0:
            return False
        x = x // 10
    return True

def count_odd_digit_numbers(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if has_all_odd_digits(i):
            count += 1
    return count

print("n | count of numbers ≤n with all odd digits")
print("------------------------------------------")
for n in range(9, 30):
    print(f"{n} | {count_odd_digit_numbers(n)}")
```

This program:
1. Checks if a number has all odd digits
2. Counts how many such numbers exist ≤ n for n from 9 to 29
3. Prints the results in a table format
The output may help observe patterns like exponential growth (since there are 5 choices per digit). For an actual competition problem, you'd adjust the property being counted based on the problem statement.
