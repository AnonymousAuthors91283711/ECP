Checking n=2, target range [2, 3]. Expected Answer Type: Bool
<<<true>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks if there exists an injective function f from ℕ to ℕ with range [2,2000] that preserves gcd relationships. The enumerated case for n=2 shows this is impossible (hence true for ¬∃). The general answer is true because the range constraint makes it impossible to satisfy all gcd preservation conditions.
