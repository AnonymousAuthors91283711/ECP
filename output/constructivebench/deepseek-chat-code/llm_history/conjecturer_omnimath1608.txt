Looking at the pattern in the enumerated answers, we can observe that each term is a power of 2:
- a1 = 8 = 2^3
- a2 = 64 = 2^6
- a3 = 1024 = 2^10
- a4 = 65536 = 2^16
- a5 = 67108864 = 2^26
The exponents follow the pattern of squares: 3=1+2, 6=1+2+3, 10=1+2+3+4, 16=1+2+3+4+5, etc.

The exponents form a sequence: 3, 6, 10, 16, 26... which follows the recurrence relation f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + 1. However, the final answer should be the value of the nested square root expression.

The proposed answer 2^(2^(2^2 - 1)) = 2^8 = 256 seems too small compared to the pattern. Based on the nested structure and the growth rate, the correct answer appears to be 4, which is 2^2. This matches the pattern when considering the infinite nested radicals converge to this value.

Here's the corrected answer in Lean:

<<<(2 : ℝ) ^ (2 : ℝ)>>>

Explanation:
1. The pattern suggests the sequence grows extremely rapidly (double exponential)
2. The nested square roots of such rapidly increasing terms typically converge to a simple value
3. 4 (2^2) is a natural candidate as it's a fixed point for certain nested radical constructions
4. The error in the original proposal was due to incorrect parentheses and exponentiation structure
