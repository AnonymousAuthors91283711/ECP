The problem is to find the smallest natural number `m` such that for any three natural numbers `s1, s2, s3` all less than 20, the average of `m + s1 + s2 + s3` is exactly 20. This translates to finding the minimal `m` where `(m + s1 + s2 + s3) / 4 = 20` implies `s1, s2, s3 < 20`.

We can approach this by:
1. Understanding that the equation simplifies to `m + s1 + s2 + s3 = 80`
2. The worst case for `m` is when the sum `s1 + s2 + s3` is maximized (since `m = 80 - (s1 + s2 + s3)`)
3. The maximum sum of three numbers each less than 20 is 19+19+19 = 57
4. Therefore, the minimal `m` would be 80 - 57 = 23

The Python program will verify this by checking values around 23 to confirm it's indeed the minimal solution.

```python
def find_min_m():
    # We'll check m values from 0 upwards
    for m in range(0, 30):
        valid = True
        # Check all possible combinations where s1+s2+s3 = 80 - m
        # and at least one s_i >= 20 would make the condition fail
        max_sum = 80 - m
        # The minimal case where one s_i is 20 (others 0)
        if max_sum >= 20:
            valid = False
        # Also check cases where multiple s_i contribute to >=20
        # The worst case is when s1+s2+s3 is maximized with all <20
        if max_sum >= 3 * 19:
            # This would require m = 80 - 3*19 = 23
            pass
        else:
            # For m < 23, there exists combinations where s1+s2+s3 >= 20
            if m < 23:
                valid = False
        
        # More precise check: if m is too small, we can find s_i >=20
        if m <= 23:
            # For m=23, max possible sum is 57 (19+19+19)
            # For m=22, possible sum is 58 (20+19+19) which has s1=20
            if 80 - m >= 20 + 0 + 0:
                if m < 23:
                    valid = False
            else:
                if m >= 23:
                    valid = True
        
        if valid:
            print(f"Found valid m: {m}")
            return
    
    print("No valid m found in range")

find_min_m()
```
