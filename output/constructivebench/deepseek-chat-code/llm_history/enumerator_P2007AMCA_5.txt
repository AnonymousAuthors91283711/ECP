The problem is to find the value of `P2007AMCA_5_answer` that satisfies the equation:
0.2 * x + 0.1 * (1 - 0.2) * x = 10500

We can simplify this equation algebraically to find the exact value. The Python program will compute this value exactly using rational arithmetic to avoid floating-point inaccuracies.

```python
# Solve 0.2x + 0.1*(1-0.2)x = 10500
# Simplify equation: 0.2x + 0.08x = 10500 => 0.28x = 10500 => x = 10500/0.28
# Compute exact value using fractions to avoid floating point errors
from fractions import Fraction

numerator = 10500
denominator = Fraction(28, 100)  # 0.28 as fraction
x = numerator / denominator
print(f"Exact solution: {x}")  # Will print 37500
```
