theorem olympiadbench1631 :
  IsGreatest {k : ℕ | ∃ (a : ℕ), 0 < a ∧ ∀ n ∈ Icc 1 k, Nat.Prime (2^(x a n) - 1)} olympiadbench1631_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: a=2, k=1: 2^2-1 is prime
a=2, k=2: 2^5-1 is prime
a=3, k=1: 2^3-1 is prime
a=3, k=2: 2^7-1 is prime
a=5, k=1: 2^5-1 is prime
a=7, k=1: 2^7-1 is prime
Maximum k found: 2 (for a=2). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<2>>>
