[write_program]
This problem involves finding the smallest natural number `n` such that `a(n) > 100*T` where `T=5` and `a(n)` is defined recursively with `a(1)=1` and each subsequent term being the ceiling of the square root of the previous term squared plus 34.

We'll write a Python program to compute the sequence `a(n)` until we find the first term exceeding 500 (since 100*T=500). The program will print each term as it's computed and finally output the smallest `n` where `a(n) > 500`.

```python
import math

def compute_sequence():
    T = 5
    threshold = 100 * T
    a = 1  # a(1) = 1
    n = 1
    print(f"a({n}) = {a}")
    
    while a <= threshold:
        n += 1
        a = math.ceil(math.sqrt(a**2 + 34))
        print(f"a({n}) = {a}")
    
    print(f"The smallest n where a(n) > {threshold} is {n}")

compute_sequence()
```
