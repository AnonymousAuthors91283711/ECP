Ground Truth Answer: 350
Proposed Answer: 512
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the smallest number N between 1 and 1024 where the expected number of rounds is less than 2. The expected rounds formula is a sum of geometric-like terms.

2. The ground truth answer is 350, which means that for N=350, the expected rounds first drops below 2, and all larger N values up to 1024 also satisfy this condition.

3. The proposed answer is 512, which is significantly larger than 350. 

4. To verify, let's think about the behavior:
   - The expected rounds decreases as N increases (since (n-1)/1024 increases)
   - 512 is exactly halfway in the range (1024/2)
   - The condition becomes true at N=350, which is earlier than 512

5. The proposed answer is incorrect because:
   - It's not the least N satisfying the condition
   - There are smaller N values (starting from 350) that already satisfy expected_rounds N < 2
