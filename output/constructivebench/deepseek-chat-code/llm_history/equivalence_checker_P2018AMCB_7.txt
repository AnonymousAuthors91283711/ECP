Ground Truth Answer: 3 * (log 23 / log 7)
Proposed Answer: Real.logb 7 (23^3)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. 

Explanation:
- The ground truth answer is `3 * (log 23 / log 7)`, which simplifies to `log(23^3)/log(7)` by logarithm power rule.
- The proposed answer is `Real.logb 7 (23^3)`, which by definition is equal to `log(23^3)/log(7)`.
- Therefore, both expressions are mathematically equivalent.
