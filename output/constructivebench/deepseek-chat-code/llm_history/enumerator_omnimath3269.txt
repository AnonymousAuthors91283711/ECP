[write_program]
This problem involves finding pairs of real polynomials (p, q) that satisfy a functional equation. We'll enumerate low-degree polynomial pairs to identify patterns. The equation is p(x)q(x+1) - p(x+1)q(x) = 1 for all real x.

We'll search for pairs where both p and q are polynomials of degree â‰¤ 2, as higher degrees become computationally intensive. The program will systematically generate polynomial coefficients and check the functional equation at sample points.
