Total count: 36. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the enumerated answers, we observe they are all perfect squares that divide 10^10. The count is 36, which is (11 choose 2) = 55 minus 19 (non-square divisors). The exact count can be derived from the prime factorization of 10^10 = 2^10 * 5^10. For a number to be a perfect square divisor, the exponents in its prime factorization must be even and ≤10 for both primes. There are 6 choices (0,2,4,6,8,10) for each prime's exponent, giving 6*6=36 total combinations.
