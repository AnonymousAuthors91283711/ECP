This problem asks to find two distinct complex numbers z1 and z2 that satisfy z^2 + 2z = i, and then compute the product of their real parts. We'll solve the quadratic equation to find all roots, then compute the product of real parts for distinct pairs.

```python
import cmath

# Solve z^2 + 2z - i = 0
a = 1
b = 2
c = -1j  # -i since equation is z^2 + 2z = i => z^2 + 2z - i = 0

# Compute discriminant
discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c

# Find both roots
z1 = (-b + cmath.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
z2 = (-b - cmath.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)

# Extract real parts
re_z1 = z1.real
re_z2 = z2.real

# Compute product of real parts
product = re_z1 * re_z2

# Output the roots and the product
print(f"Root 1: {z1}")
print(f"Root 2: {z2}")
print(f"Product of real parts: {product}")
```
