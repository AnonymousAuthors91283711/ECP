From the enumerated solutions, we observe that all valid functions are linear (f(n) = a*n) with constant term 0. The quadratic term is always 0, and the constant term is always 0. The only varying parameter is the coefficient of n. Therefore, the general solution is a linear function with arbitrary integer coefficient.
