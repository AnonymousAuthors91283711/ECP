This problem involves finding coprime positive integers m and n that satisfy the equation (n - m) * 9 = 2 * (n / 2 - 2 * m), with m + n minimized. The solution requires enumerating possible (m, n) pairs efficiently.

We'll:
1. Iterate through possible m values (up to a reasonable limit)
2. For each m, solve for n in the equation
3. Check if n is integer and coprime with m
4. Track the minimal m+n found

```python
import math

def find_minimal_solution():
    min_sum = float('inf')
    best_pair = None
    
    # Iterate m from 1 to 1000 (arbitrary large enough bound)
    for m in range(1, 1001):
        # Solve equation (n - m)*9 = 2*(n//2 - 2*m)
        # Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate division
        # 18(n - m) = 2(n - 4m) => 18n - 18m = 2n - 8m
        # 16n = 10m => n = (10m)/16 = (5m)/8
        # But n must be integer, so 5m must be divisible by 8
        if (5 * m) % 8 != 0:
            continue
        n = (5 * m) // 8
        if n <= 0:
            continue
        
        # Check coprimality
        if math.gcd(m, n) != 1:
            continue
        
        current_sum = m + n
        print(f"Found valid pair: m={m}, n={n}, sum={current_sum}")
        
        if current_sum < min_sum:
            min_sum = current_sum
            best_pair = (m, n)
    
    if best_pair:
        m, n = best_pair
        print(f"\nMinimal solution: m={m}, n={n}, sum={min_sum}")
    else:
        print("No solution found in range")

find_minimal_solution()
