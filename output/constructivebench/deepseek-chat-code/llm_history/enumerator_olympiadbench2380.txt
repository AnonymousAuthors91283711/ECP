[write_program]
This problem involves finding a closed-form expression for a sum of reciprocal sine terms. The sum is over i from 0 to 10 of 1/sin(8*2^i). The theorem states that this sum equals 1/sin(θ) for some θ. We'll write a Python program to compute the sum numerically and look for patterns.

The approach is:
1. Compute the sum numerically
2. Compute 1/sum to see if it matches a simple trigonometric value
3. Look for patterns in the result that might suggest the closed form

```python
import math

def compute_sum():
    total = 0.0
    for i in range(11):  # i from 0 to 10
        angle = 8 * (2 ** i)
        # Convert to radians since Python's sin uses radians
        angle_rad = math.radians(angle)
        term = 1 / math.sin(angle_rad)
        total += term
        print(f"Term {i}: angle={angle}°, term={term:.6f}, sum={total:.6f}")
    
    print(f"\nFinal sum: {total:.15f}")
    print(f"1/sum: {1/total:.15f}")
    print(f"arcsin(1/sum) in degrees: {math.degrees(math.asin(1/total)):.15f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_sum()
```

The program computes each term of the sum, shows partial sums, and finally computes 1/sum and its arcsine to help identify a pattern. The output will show whether the final result corresponds to a simple angle that might be the answer in the theorem.
