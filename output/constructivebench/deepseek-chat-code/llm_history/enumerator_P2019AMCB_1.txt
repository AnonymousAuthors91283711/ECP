This problem involves finding the ratio V₁/V₂ given the equation (5/6)*V₁ = (3/4)*V₂, with V₁, V₂ > 0. We'll solve for the ratio by enumerating possible rational values and checking the condition.

The approach is:
1. Solve the equation for V₁/V₂
2. The solution is V₁/V₂ = (3/4)/(5/6) = (3/4)*(6/5) = 18/20 = 9/10
3. We'll verify this by testing small rational values

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve_ratio():
    # We'll test small denominators up to 20
    max_denominator = 20
    solutions = []
    
    for d1 in range(1, max_denominator + 1):
        for n1 in range(1, d1 + 1):
            v1 = Fraction(n1, d1)
            for d2 in range(1, max_denominator + 1):
                for n2 in range(1, d2 + 1):
                    v2 = Fraction(n2, d2)
                    if (Fraction(5,6)*v1 == (Fraction(3,4)*v2):
                        ratio = v1/v2
                        if ratio not in solutions:
                            solutions.append(ratio)
                            print(f"Found solution: V1/V2 = {ratio}")
    
    # After enumeration, print the simplest form
    if solutions:
        simplest = min(solutions, key=lambda x: (x.denominator, x.numerator))
        print(f"Simplest form solution: {simplest}")

solve_ratio()

Judgement:
The original program has a syntax error (missing closing parenthesis in the if condition) and is inefficient due to nested loops. The problem is algebraic and doesn't require enumeration - we can solve it directly by rearranging the given equation. The program should compute the exact ratio V₁/V₂ from the equation (5/6)*V₁ = (3/4)*V₂.

<<<False>>>

Here's the corrected program that directly computes the solution:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve_ratio():
    # Given equation: (5/6)*V1 = (3/4)*V2
    # Solving for V1/V2:
    ratio = Fraction(3,4) / Fraction(5,6)
    # Simplify the fraction
    simplified = ratio.limit_denominator()
    print(f"Solution: V1/V2 = {simplified}")

solve_ratio()
```

The corrected program:
1. Directly computes the ratio from the given equation
2. Uses exact fractions instead of enumeration
3. Outputs the simplified form immediately
4. Is much more efficient (O(1) instead of O(n⁴))
5. Correctly solves the mathematical problem without approximation
