This problem is about finding the ratio l₁/L where L is the sum of four distinct positive numbers l₁, l₂, l₃, l₄ that satisfy the conditions l₁ = 2l₂, l₂ = 2l₃, and l₃ = 2l₄. We'll write a Python program to compute this ratio symbolically.

The solution approach:
1. Express all lengths in terms of l₄ since there's a chain of doubling relationships
2. Compute the sum L in terms of l₄
3. Calculate the ratio l₁/L
4. Simplify the fraction to its lowest terms

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Express all lengths in terms of l4
l4 = 1  # arbitrary scaling factor since we want ratio
l3 = 2 * l4
l2 = 2 * l3
l1 = 2 * l2

# Compute total length L
L = l1 + l2 + l3 + l4

# Calculate the ratio l1/L
ratio = Fraction(l1, L)

# Output the simplified fraction
print(f"l1/L = {ratio}")
```

The program outputs the exact fractional value of the ratio l₁/L. The scaling factor cancels out in the ratio calculation, so we can use 1 for simplicity. The output will be the simplified fraction representing the exact value of the ratio.
