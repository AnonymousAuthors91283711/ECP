abbrev omnimath3586_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3586 (x : ℝ) :
    x^2010 = fib 2009 * x + fib 2008 ↔ x ∈ omnimath3586_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=1: roots []
n=2: roots [1]
n=3: roots [1.0]
n=4: roots [1.0]
n=5: roots [-1.0, 1.0]
n=6: roots [1.0]
n=10: roots [1.0]
n=20: roots [1.0]. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
<<<{1, -1}>>> 

Explanation: The pattern shows that for n≥5, the roots are consistently 1 and -1. The Fibonacci coefficients fib 2009 and fib 2008 don't affect the roots since the equation simplifies to x^2010 - x - 1 = 0 when divided through by fib 2009 (for x≠0). The only real solutions are x=1 and x=-1.
