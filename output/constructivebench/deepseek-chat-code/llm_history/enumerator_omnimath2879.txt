[write_program]
This problem appears to be a simple equation solving task where we need to find the value of n that satisfies the equation 8 + 6 = n + 8. The solution is straightforward algebra, but we'll write a Python program to verify this numerically.

The equation simplifies to:
8 + 6 = n + 8
14 = n + 8
n = 14 - 8
n = 6

However, since we're asked to write a program to enumerate possible answers, we'll create a simple program that checks values around the expected solution to demonstrate the approach.

```python
def find_n():
    # We'll check values around the expected solution (n=6)
    for n in range(0, 11):  # Checking from 0 to 10
        left = 8 + 6
        right = n + 8
        if left == right:
            print(f"Found solution: n = {n}")
            return
    print("No solution found in range")

find_n()
```
