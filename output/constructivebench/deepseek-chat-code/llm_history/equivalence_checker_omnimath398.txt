Ground Truth Answer: 4012013006001
Proposed Answer: 2001^2 * 2002^2 / 4
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the sum of cubes from 1³ to 2001³.

2. The ground truth answer is 4,012,013,006,001.

3. The proposed answer uses the formula for sum of cubes: (n(n+1)/2)² where n=2001.

Let's verify:
- The formula for sum of cubes from 1³ to n³ is indeed (n(n+1)/2)²
- For n=2001: (2001*2002/2)² = (2001*1001)²
- Calculating 2001*1001 = 2003001
- Then 2003001² = 4012013006001

This exactly matches the ground truth answer. The proposed answer is just written in a different but equivalent form (2001² * 2002² /4 is algebraically equivalent to (2001*2002/2)²).
