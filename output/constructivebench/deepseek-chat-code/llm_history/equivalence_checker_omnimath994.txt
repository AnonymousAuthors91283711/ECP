Ground Truth Answer: 1999008 / 1999012
Proposed Answer: 999504/999505
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem calculates a probability ratio involving color pairs:
   - sameColorPairs = sum of n*(n-1) for each color (where n is the count)
   - redGreenPairs = 2*2 (special case for red-green pairs)

2. Calculating sameColorPairs:
   - For all colors except copper: 8 colors × (2×1) = 16
   - For copper: 2000×1999 = 3,998,000
   - Total sameColorPairs = 16 + 3,998,000 = 3,998,016

3. Denominator is sameColorPairs + redGreenPairs = 3,998,016 + 4 = 3,998,020

4. Ground truth gives 1,999,008/1,999,012
   - This is exactly half of numerator and denominator (3,998,016/2=1,999,008 and 3,998,020/2=1,999,010)
   - Wait, this doesn't match our calculation of denominator (should be 3,998,020)

5. Proposed answer is 999,504/999,505
   - This is approximately equal to 3,998,016/3,998,020 (≈0.999999)
   - But not exactly equal to either our calculation or ground truth

The ground truth answer appears incorrect based on our calculation (denominator should be 3,998,020 not 3,998,024). The proposed answer is closer to the correct value but not exactly matching either.
