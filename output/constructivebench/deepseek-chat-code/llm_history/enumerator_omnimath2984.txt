[write_program]
This problem is asking for the unique value of b that makes the equation `0 = 2*(-4) + b` true. The solution is straightforward algebra - we just need to solve for b. The program will compute this value exactly.

```python
# Solving 0 = 2*(-4) + b for b
b = 2 * 4  # Since 0 = -8 + b => b = 8
print(b)
```
