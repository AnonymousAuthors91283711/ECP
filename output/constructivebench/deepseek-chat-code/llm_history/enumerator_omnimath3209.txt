[write_program]
The problem is to find the natural number `n` that satisfies the equation `m + 1/(n + 1/p) = 17/3` with the constraints `m=5` and `p=2`. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of `n` and check which one satisfies the equation.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve():
    m = 5
    p = 2
    target = Fraction(17, 3)
    
    for n in range(1, 100):  # Reasonable upper bound
        # Compute m + 1/(n + 1/p)
        value = Fraction(m) + Fraction(1, n + Fraction(1, p))
        if value == target:
            print(f"Found solution: n = {n}")
            return
    
    print("No solution found in the search range")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```
