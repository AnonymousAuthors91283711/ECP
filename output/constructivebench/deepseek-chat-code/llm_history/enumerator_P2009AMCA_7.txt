[write_program]
This problem involves finding natural numbers x and n that satisfy two equations:
1. A condition relating consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence
2. An equation setting the nth term equal to 2009

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible x values and compute corresponding n values, checking for natural number solutions.

```python
def find_solutions():
    for x in range(1, 1000):  # Reasonable upper bound
        denominator = 3 * x - 8
        if denominator == 0:
            continue  # Skip division by zero
        
        # Check first condition (arithmetic sequence condition)
        left = (5 * x - 11) - (2 * x - 3)
        right = (3 * x + 1) - (5 * x - 11)
        if left != right:
            continue
        
        # Compute n from second equation
        numerator = 2009 - (2 * x - 3)
        if numerator % denominator != 0:
            continue
        
        n = numerator // denominator + 1
        if n > 0:  # Ensure natural number
            print(f"x = {x}, n = {n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solutions()
```
