Ground Truth Answer: fun m => m * π - π / 4
Proposed Answer: fun m : ℤ => m * Real.pi / 4
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for integer values m such that x = f(m) satisfies the given trigonometric equation.

2. The ground truth answer suggests x = mπ - π/4 (where m is integer)

3. The proposed answer suggests x = mπ/4 (where m is integer)

Let's test both solutions:

For ground truth:
Take x = mπ - π/4
The equation simplifies to cos(2*(mπ - π/4)) = cos(2mπ - π/2) = cos(π/2) = 0
The left side also simplifies to 0, so it satisfies the equation.

For proposed answer:
Take x = mπ/4
For m=1 (x=π/4):
Left side = sin(π/4)^3*(1 + cot(π/4)) + cos(π/4)^3*(1 + tan(π/4)) ≈ 1.414
Right side = cos(π/2) = 0
These don't match, so the proposed answer is incorrect.

The proposed answer only works for specific values (like m=2 gives x=π/2 which works), but not generally.
