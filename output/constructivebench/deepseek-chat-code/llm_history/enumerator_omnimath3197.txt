This problem asks for the remainder when 1000 is divided by x, given that 100 divided by x leaves a remainder of 10. We need to find all possible x values that satisfy 100 % x = 10, then compute 1000 % x for each.

Key observations:
1. From 100 % x = 10, we know x > 10 (since remainder must be less than divisor)
2. x must divide (100 - 10) = 90
3. We'll find all divisors of 90 greater than 10, then compute 1000 % x for each

```python
def find_remainders():
    # Find all divisors of 90 greater than 10
    n = 90
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i > 10:
                divisors.add(i)
            if (n // i) > 10:
                divisors.add(n // i)
    
    # Sort divisors for orderly output
    sorted_divisors = sorted(divisors)
    
    # Compute and print 1000 % x for each valid x
    for x in sorted_divisors:
        remainder = 1000 % x
        print(f"For x = {x}, 1000 % x = {remainder}")

find_remainders()
