The problem involves solving a system of linear equations to find coefficients a and b, then using them to compute a new value. We'll enumerate possible (a,b) pairs that satisfy the given equations, then compute T(L3,G3).

```python
def main():
    # Given values from the problem
    L1, G1 = 1.5, 800
    L2, G2 = 1.2, 1100
    T1, T2 = 69, 69
    L3, G3 = 4.2, 4000
    
    # Solve the system of equations:
    # 1.5a + 800b = 69
    # 1.2a + 1100b = 69
    
    # Let's find exact rational solutions first
    # Multiply first equation by 4, second by 5 to eliminate a:
    # 6a + 3200b = 276
    # 6a + 5500b = 345
    # Subtract: 2300b = 69 => b = 69/2300 = 3/100
    
    b = 3/100
    # Substitute back to find a: 1.5a + 800*(3/100) = 69 => 1.5a + 24 = 69 => a = 30
    
    # Now compute T(L3, G3)
    result = 30 * L3 + (3/100) * G3
    print(f"T(L3,G3) = {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
