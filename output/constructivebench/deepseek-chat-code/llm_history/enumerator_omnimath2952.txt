[write_program]
The problem appears to be evaluating the function (fun x => x - 5) at x=0, which simplifies to 0 - 5 = -5. However, since this is a competition-level problem, I'll write a Python program that verifies this calculation and can be extended to handle more complex cases if needed.

```python
def evaluate_function(x):
    return x - 5

# Evaluate at x=0
result = evaluate_function(0)
print(f"Evaluation at x=0: {result}")

# For demonstration, also evaluate at some other points
for x in [-2, 0, 3, 5]:
    print(f"f({x}) = {evaluate_function(x)}")
```
