This problem asks for the number of subsets of pairs from a 6×6 grid where:
1. No pair has equal coordinates (no diagonal elements)
2. For each row/column index, exactly 3 pairs contain that index (as either first or second element)

We'll enumerate all possible configurations by:
1. Representing pairs as (i,j) where i≠j
2. Ensuring each number 0-5 appears exactly 3 times in first or second position
3. Counting valid configurations

```python
from itertools import combinations

def solve():
    n = 6
    elements = [(i,j) for i in range(n) for j in range(n) if i != j]
    count = 0
    
    # We need exactly 9 pairs since each of 6 elements appears in 3 pairs (6*3/2=9)
    for s in combinations(elements, 9):
        degree = [0]*n
        valid = True
        for (i,j) in s:
            degree[i] += 1
            degree[j] += 1
            if degree[i] > 3 or degree[j] > 3:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid and all(d == 3 for d in degree):
            count += 1
            print(f"Found configuration {count}: {s}")
    
    print(f"Total number of valid configurations: {count}")

solve()
```
