[write_program]
This problem involves finding real numbers u and v that satisfy two polynomial equations. We'll write a Python program to numerically approximate solutions to these equations within a reasonable range. The program will use Newton's method for root finding.

```python
import numpy as np

def equation_u(u):
    """Evaluates the u equation: sum(u^(k+1) for k=0..7) + 10u^9 - 8"""
    return sum(u**(k+1) for k in range(8)) + 10*u**9 - 8

def equation_v(v):
    """Evaluates the v equation: sum(v^(k+1) for k=0..9) + 10v^11 - 8"""
    return sum(v**(k+1) for k in range(10)) + 10*v**11 - 8

def derivative(f, x, h=1e-6):
    """Numerical derivative for Newton's method"""
    return (f(x + h) - f(x - h)) / (2 * h)

def newton_method(f, x0, tol=1e-10, max_iter=100):
    """Newton's method for root finding"""
    x = x0
    for _ in range(max_iter):
        fx = f(x)
        if abs(fx) < tol:
            return x
        dfx = derivative(f, x)
        if dfx == 0:
            return None
        x -= fx / dfx
    return None

def find_roots(f, start, end, step=0.1):
    """Find roots in [start, end] by sampling initial guesses"""
    roots = set()
    x = start
    while x <= end:
        root = newton_method(f, x)
        if root is not None and start <= root <= end:
            roots.add(round(root, 8))  # Round to avoid floating point duplicates
        x += step
    return sorted(roots)

# Find and print roots for u
print("Possible u values:")
u_roots = find_roots(equation_u, -2, 2)
for u in u_roots:
    print(f"u = {u}")

# Find and print roots for v
print("\nPossible v values:")
v_roots = find_roots(equation_v, -2, 2)
for v in v_roots:
    print(f"v = {v}")

# Print the pair (u, v) that appears in both roots (if any)
common = set(u_roots) & set(v_roots)
if common:
    print("\nCommon root(s):")
    for x in common:
        print(f"u = v = {x}")
else:
    print("\nNo common roots found in the searched range")
```
