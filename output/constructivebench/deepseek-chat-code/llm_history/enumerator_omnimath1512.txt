[write_program]
This problem involves finding digits A, B, C, D (with A > B > C > D > 0) that satisfy a specific equation. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible combinations of these digits and check the conditions.

The program will:
1. Iterate through all possible values of A (1-9)
2. For each A, iterate through possible B (1 to A-1)
3. For each B, iterate through possible C (1 to B-1)
4. For each C, iterate through possible D (1 to C-1)
5. Check if the equation is satisfied
6. Print valid combinations and compute B + C + D

```python
def main():
    for A in range(1, 10):
        for B in range(1, A):
            for C in range(1, B):
                for D in range(1, C):
                    # Calculate both sides of the equation
                    left = (A * 1000 + B * 100 + C * 10 + D) - (D * 1000 + C * 100 + B * 10 + A)
                    right = (B * 1000 + D * 100 + A * 10 + C)
                    
                    if left == right:
                        print(f"A={A}, B={B}, C={C}, D={D}, B+C+D={B+C+D}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
