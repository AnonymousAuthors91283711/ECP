This problem involves finding the smallest integer K' > 9 such that (2010 - 10) is divisible by (K' - 9), and for all other K'' > 9 with the same property, the absolute difference between K'' and the quotient (2000)/(K''-9) is at least the value obtained when K''=49.

We'll approach this by:
1. Calculating the target value for K=49 first (which is |49 - (2000/40)| = |49-50| = 1)
2. Finding all divisors of 2000 (since 2000 must be divisible by K'-9)
3. Checking each divisor to find K' values that satisfy the condition
4. Selecting the smallest K' > 9 that meets all requirements

```python
def main():
    target_K = 49
    target_diff = abs(target_K - (2000 // (target_K - 9)))
    
    # Find all divisors of 2000
    divisors = set()
    for d in range(1, int(2000**0.5) + 1):
        if 2000 % d == 0:
            divisors.add(d)
            divisors.add(2000 // d)
    
    # Check each possible K' = d + 9 where d divides 2000
    valid_Ks = []
    for d in sorted(divisors):
        K = d + 9
        if K <= 9:
            continue
        quotient = 2000 // d
        current_diff = abs(K - quotient)
        if current_diff >= target_diff:
            valid_Ks.append(K)
    
    # Output all valid K's and the minimal one
    print("Valid K values satisfying condition:")
    for K in sorted(valid_Ks):
        print(K)
    
    if valid_Ks:
        print("\nMinimal K satisfying condition:", min(valid_Ks))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
