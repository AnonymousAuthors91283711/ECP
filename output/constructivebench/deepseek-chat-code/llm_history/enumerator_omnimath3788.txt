[write_program]
This problem involves finding all integer-valued functions f: ℤ → ℤ that satisfy a specific functional equation. The functional equation is:
f(4x + 3y) = f(3x + y) + f(x + 2y) for all integers x, y.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible polynomial solutions of low degree (since polynomial solutions are often good candidates for functional equations). We'll test linear and quadratic functions since higher degrees become complex.

```python
def test_function(f):
    """Test if function f satisfies the functional equation."""
    for x in range(-3, 4):
        for y in range(-3, 4):
            left = f(4*x + 3*y)
            right = f(3*x + y) + f(x + 2*y)
            if left != right:
                return False
    return True

# Test linear functions f(n) = a*n + b
print("Testing linear functions f(n) = a*n + b:")
for a in range(-5, 6):
    for b in range(-5, 6):
        f = lambda n, a=a, b=b: a*n + b
        if test_function(f):
            print(f"Found solution: f(n) = {a}n + {b}")

# Test quadratic functions f(n) = a*n² + b*n + c
print("\nTesting quadratic functions f(n) = a*n² + b*n + c:")
for a in range(-3, 4):
    for b in range(-5, 6):
        for c in range(-5, 6):
            f = lambda n, a=a, b=b, c=c: a*n**2 + b*n + c
            if test_function(f):
                print(f"Found solution: f(n) = {a}n² + {b}n + {c}")

# Note: The program tests small integer coefficients for practicality
# The actual solution space might include more general functions
```
