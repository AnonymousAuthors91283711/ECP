This problem asks for the smallest natural number `k` such that there exist non-negative integers `a,b,c` with `a > 0` satisfying `a + 4b + 9c = 529` (since 23Â² = 529). We need to find the minimal `a` that works.

The approach is to:
1. Iterate through possible values of `a` from 1 upwards
2. For each `a`, check if (529 - a) can be expressed as 4b + 9c for non-negative b,c
3. The first valid `a` we find is the minimal solution

```python
def solve():
    target = 23 * 23
    for a in range(1, target + 1):
        remaining = target - a
        # Check if remaining can be expressed as 4b + 9c
        max_c = remaining // 9
        found = False
        for c in range(max_c, -1, -1):
            rem = remaining - 9 * c
            if rem >= 0 and rem % 4 == 0:
                found = True
                break
        if found:
            print(f"Found minimal a: {a}")
            return

solve()
```
