[write_program]
This problem is asking to compute (3 * 542) modulo 10, which is equivalent to finding the last digit of 3 * 542. We can solve this directly by performing the multiplication and taking modulo 10, but since we need to write a Python program to enumerate possible answers, we'll approach it differently.

The program will:
1. Calculate 3 * 542
2. Compute the result modulo 10
3. Print the final answer

Since this is a straightforward computation, there's no need for enumeration, but we'll structure it as required.

```python
# Compute (3 * 542) mod 10
result = (3 * 542) % 10
print(result)
```
