[write_program]
This problem asks to find all real numbers x that satisfy the equation (x + 8)^4 = (2x + 16)^2. We'll write a Python program to find these solutions numerically and symbolically.

The approach is:
1. Simplify the equation by substitution (let y = x + 8)
2. Solve the simplified equation y^4 = (2y)^2
3. Find all real roots and back-substitute to get x values

```python
import sympy as sp

def solve_equation():
    x = sp.symbols('x')
    equation = (x + 8)**4 - (2*x + 16)**2
    solutions = sp.solve(equation, x)
    
    print("Exact solutions:")
    for sol in solutions:
        print(sol)
    
    print("\nNumerical approximations:")
    for sol in solutions:
        print(float(sol.evalf()))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_equation()
```
