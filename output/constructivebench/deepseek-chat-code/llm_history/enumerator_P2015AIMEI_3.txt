[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest prime p such that 16p + 1 is a perfect cube. We'll write a Python program to find this by checking primes in order and verifying if (16p + 1) is a perfect cube.

The approach:
1. Generate primes in order
2. For each prime p, check if (16p + 1) is a perfect cube
3. The first such prime found will be the answer

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]:
        if n % p == 0:
            return n == p
    d = n - 1
    s = 0
    while d % 2 == 0:
        d //= 2
        s += 1
    for a in [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]:
        if a >= n:
            continue
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(s - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False
    return True

def find_min_prime():
    p = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(p):
            m = 16 * p + 1
            # Check if m is perfect cube
            root = round(m ** (1/3))
            if root * root * root == m:
                print(f"Found prime: {p}, with n={root}")
                print(f"Minimum prime satisfying condition: {p}")
                return
        p += 1

find_min_prime()
```
