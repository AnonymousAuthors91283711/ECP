abbrev omnimath1217_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1217
(f : ℝ → ℝ)
(hf : ∀ x y : ℝ, f x + f (2 * x + y) + 5 * x * y = f (3 * x - y) + 2 * x ^ 2 + 1)
: (f 10 = omnimath1217_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found potential solution: f(x) = -1x² + 1x + -1
f(10) = -91
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<< -91 >>>
