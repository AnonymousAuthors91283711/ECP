[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that the expression √(100 + √n) + √(100 - √n) is an integer. We'll write a Python program to search for such n values.

The approach:
1. We'll iterate through possible integer values of k (the result of the expression)
2. For each k, we'll solve for n
3. We'll check if n is a perfect square (since √n must be real)
4. We'll print valid n values and track the smallest one

```python
import math

def find_min_n():
    min_n = None
    # k must be between 2√50 ≈ 14.14 and 2√100 = 20
    for k in range(15, 21):
        # From the equation: k = √(100 + √n) + √(100 - √n)
        # Squaring gives: k² = 200 + 2√(10000 - n)
        # Solving for n: n = 10000 - ((k² - 200)/2)²
        temp = (k**2 - 200)/2
        if temp.is_integer():
            temp = int(temp)
            n = 10000 - temp**2
            if n > 0:
                sqrt_n = math.sqrt(n)
                if sqrt_n.is_integer():
                    print(f"Found valid n: {n} for k={k}")
                    if min_n is None or n < min_n:
                        min_n = n
    if min_n is not None:
        print(f"Smallest n found: {min_n}")
    else:
        print("No valid n found")

find_min_n()
```
