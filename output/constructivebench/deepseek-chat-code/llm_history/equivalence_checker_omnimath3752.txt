Ground Truth Answer: {11250, 4050, 7500, 1620, 1200, 720}
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | ∃ p q : ℕ, p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ p ≠ q ∧ n = p^4 * q^2 * 30}
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is asking for natural numbers n where:
1. 30 divides n (so n must have prime factors 2, 3, and 5)
2. The number of divisors of n is exactly 30

The ground truth gives specific numbers that satisfy these conditions. The proposed answer gives a general form for such numbers.

Let's check if the proposed form matches the ground truth:
- For a number n = p⁴ * q² * 30, the number of divisors would be (4+1)*(2+1)*(1+1)*(1+1)*(1+1) = 5*3*2*2*2 = 120 ≠ 30. This is incorrect.

The correct form should be numbers with exactly 30 divisors that are multiples of 30. The ground truth numbers have prime factorizations like:
- 720 = 2⁴ * 3² * 5¹ (divisors: 5*3*2=30)
- 1200 = 2⁴ * 3¹ * 5² (divisors: 5*2*3=30)
etc.

The proposed answer's form doesn't correctly capture the divisor count condition.

<<<False>>>
