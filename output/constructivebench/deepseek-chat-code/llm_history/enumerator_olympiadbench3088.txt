The problem asks to find the maximum possible sum of digits A and B (each between 0 and 9) such that:
1. Neither 4A6 nor 1B7 is divisible by 9
2. Their product is divisible by 9
3. A and B are digits (0-9)

We'll enumerate all possible A and B combinations, check the conditions, and track the maximum sum.

```python
max_sum = 0
valid_pairs = []

for A in range(10):
    for B in range(10):
        num1 = 400 + A * 10 + 6
        num2 = 100 + B * 10 + 7
        cond1 = (num1 % 9) != 0
        cond2 = (num2 % 9) != 0
        cond3 = (num1 * num2) % 9 == 0
        
        if cond1 and cond2 and cond3:
            current_sum = A + B
            valid_pairs.append((A, B, current_sum))
            print(f"A={A}, B={B}, sum={current_sum}")
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum

print(f"\nMaximum sum found: {max_sum}")
```
