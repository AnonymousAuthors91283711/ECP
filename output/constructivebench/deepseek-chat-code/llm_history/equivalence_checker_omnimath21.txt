Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1, 1, 0), (2, 2, 1, 1), (1, 0, 0, 0), (3, 0, 0, 1)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1, 0), (2, 2, 1, 1), (3, 0, 0, 1)}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer contains exactly the same elements as the ground truth answer, just in a different order. Since sets are unordered collections, the two answers are equivalent. All four tuples satisfy the equation 2^x * 3^y - 5^z * 7^w = 1, and no additional solutions are included.
