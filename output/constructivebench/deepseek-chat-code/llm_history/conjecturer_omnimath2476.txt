<<<603>>> 

Explanation: The pattern suggests a relationship where the answer is often close to 600, with variations based on n's divisibility. The most consistent value near the examples is 603, which fits the general trend and maintains Coprime condition. The exact formula would involve gcd calculations, but 603 serves as a reasonable base value.
