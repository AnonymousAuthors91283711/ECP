The problem asks to count all 4-digit numbers (from 1000 to 9999) where each digit in even positions (thousands, hundreds, tens, units) is even. We'll enumerate all possible combinations of digits that satisfy these conditions.

```python
def count_even_digit_numbers():
    count = 0
    # Thousands digit (1-9, must be even)
    for a in [2,4,6,8]:
        # Hundreds digit (0-9, must be even)
        for b in [0,2,4,6,8]:
            # Tens digit (0-9, must be even)
            for c in [0,2,4,6,8]:
                # Units digit (0-9, must be even)
                for d in [0,2,4,6,8]:
                    num = a*1000 + b*100 + c*10 + d
                    if 1000 <= num <= 9999:
                        count += 1
                        print(num)  # Stream partial results
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

count_even_digit_numbers()
```
