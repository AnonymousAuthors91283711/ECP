Ground Truth Answer: 240
Proposed Answer: 2^8 - 2^4
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the number of subsets of {2,3,...,9} that contain at least one prime number. The ground truth answer is 240.

2. The proposed answer is 2^8 - 2^4. Let's evaluate this:
- 2^8 = 256 (total number of subsets of an 8-element set)
- 2^4 = 16 (number of subsets of {4,6,8,9}, the non-prime elements)
- 256 - 16 = 240

3. The proposed answer correctly calculates:
- Total subsets minus subsets containing no primes
- This matches exactly with the ground truth answer of 240

<<<True>>>
