Based on the enumerated answers and the problem's condition that requires k to divide differences of certain powers only when m=n, the solution appears to be the set of prime numbers. The condition holds for primes because of Fermat's Little Theorem properties.

Based on the error message and the enumerated answers (2, 3), I can see that the problem is looking for prime numbers. The error occurs because Lean needs explicit namespace qualification for the `Prime` predicate. The pattern in the enumerated answers (2, 3) suggests prime numbers, and the mathematical condition in the theorem statement (about divisibility of differences of powers) is known to hold for primes.

Here's the corrected answer with proper namespace qualification:

<<<{k | Nat.Prime k}>>>

Explanation:
1. The error was due to ambiguous namespace for `Prime` - we need to specify `Nat.Prime`
2. The enumerated answers (2, 3) are exactly the primes in that range
3. The mathematical condition about not dividing differences of powers is a known property of prime numbers (related to Fermat's Little Theorem)
4. The solution generalizes to all prime numbers, not just those found in the enumeration
