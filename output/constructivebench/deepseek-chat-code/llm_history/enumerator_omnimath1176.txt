This problem involves calculating the average value of a 6-variable function modulo 64 over all combinations of integers from 1 to 100. The function is a weighted sum M(a,b,c,d,e,f) = a + 2b + 4c + 8d + 16e + 32f. We need to compute the average of M mod 64 over all possible combinations.

To approach this, we'll:
1. Recognize that modulo 64 operations make the problem periodic
2. Observe that each variable contributes independently to the sum modulo 64
3. Calculate the average contribution from each term separately
4. Combine these averages since expectation is linear

Here's a Python program that verifies the pattern by computing partial sums and showing the convergence:

```python
def compute_average():
    total = 0
    count = 0
    n = 100
    
    # Precompute average contributions for each term
    avg_a = sum(i % 64 for i in range(1, n+1)) / n
    avg_2b = sum((2*i) % 64 for i in range(1, n+1)) / n
    avg_4c = sum((4*i) % 64 for i in range(1, n+1)) / n
    avg_8d = sum((8*i) % 64 for i in range(1, n+1)) / n
    avg_16e = sum((16*i) % 64 for i in range(1, n+1)) / n
    avg_32f = sum((32*i) % 64 for i in range(1, n+1)) / n
    
    # Sum all average contributions
    total_avg = avg_a + avg_2b + avg_4c + avg_8d + avg_16e + avg_32f
    
    # Since expectation is linear and variables are independent
    print(f"Average value modulo 64: {total_avg}")
    
    # For verification, compute exact value
    exact_avg = (n+1)/2 + 2*(n+1)/2 + 4*(n+1)/2 + 8*(n+1)/2 + 16*(n+1)/2 + 32*(n+1)/2
    exact_avg_mod = exact_avg % 64
    print(f"Exact average before modulo: {exact_avg}")
    print(f"Exact average modulo 64: {exact_avg_mod}")

compute_average()
```
