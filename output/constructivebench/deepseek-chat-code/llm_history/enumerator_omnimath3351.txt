[write_program]
This problem asks for the unique natural number n < 10 such that 91 divides the number formed by concatenating 12345, n, and 789 (i.e., 12345n789). We'll write a Python program to find this n by checking divisibility for each n from 0 to 9.

```python
def find_unique_n():
    base = 12345 * 10**4  # 123450000
    suffix = 789
    for n in range(10):
        number = base + n * 10**3 + suffix
        if number % 91 == 0:
            print(f"Found valid n: {n}")
            return
    print("No valid n found")

find_unique_n()
```
