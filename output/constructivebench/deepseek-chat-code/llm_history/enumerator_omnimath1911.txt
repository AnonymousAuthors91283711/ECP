[write_program]
This problem involves calculating the difference between the cardinalities of two finite sets constructed from products and symmetric powers. We'll write a Python program to compute A and B for small values to help conjecture the general pattern.

The key steps are:
1. S is the integer interval [1,6]
2. A counts unordered pairs of ordered pairs from S×S (Sym2 of S×S)
3. B counts ordered pairs of unordered pairs from S (Sym2 S × Sym2 S)
4. We need to compute A - B

```python
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement, product
from math import comb

def compute_difference(n):
    # Compute |Sym2(S×S)| where S = {1..n}
    # Each element is {{(a,b),(c,d)}} where (a,b) <= (c,d) lex order
    s = range(1, n+1)
    sxs = list(product(s, repeat=2))
    # Sym2(S×S) is combinations_with_replacement of sxs elements
    A = comb(len(sxs) + 1, 2)  # n(n+1)/2 where n = |S×S| = n^2
    
    # Compute |Sym2 S × Sym2 S|
    # Sym2 S is combinations_with_replacement of s elements
    sym2_s = comb(n + 1, 2)
    B = sym2_s * sym2_s
    
    return A - B

# Compute for n=1 to 6 to match the problem
for n in range(1, 7):
    diff = compute_difference(n)
    print(f"For n={n}, A-B = {diff}")

# The problem specifies n=6, so we output that separately
print("\nFor the problem (n=6), A-B =", compute_difference(6))
```
