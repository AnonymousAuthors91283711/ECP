This problem involves finding the sum of the real parts of \(x^2 + (1-x)^2\) for all complex numbers \(x\) that satisfy the conditions \(x + y = 1\) and \(x^{20} + y^{20} = 20\) for some complex \(y\). 

We'll approach this by:
1. Substituting \(y = 1 - x\) into the second equation
2. Solving \(x^{20} + (1-x)^{20} = 20\)
3. For each solution \(x\), computing \((x^2 + (1-x)^2).re\)
4. Summing these real parts

The program will:
- Find roots numerically (since exact solutions are complex)
- Filter for distinct roots (within numerical tolerance)
- Compute and sum the required real parts

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.polynomial import Polynomial

def solve_equation():
    # We're solving x^20 + (1-x)^20 = 20
    # Let's find roots numerically
    coeffs = np.zeros(21)
    coeffs[0] = -19  # 1^20 - 20 = -19
    coeffs[20] = 2    # x^20 + (-x)^20 = 2x^20
    # Terms 1..19 come from binomial expansion of (1-x)^20
    for k in range(1, 20):
        coeffs[k] = (-1)**k * np.math.comb(20, k)
    
    p = Polynomial(coeffs)
    roots = p.roots()
    
    # Filter roots with small imaginary part (numerical tolerance)
    real_roots = [r for r in roots if abs(r.imag) < 1e-10]
    real_roots = [r.real for r in real_roots]
    
    # Remove duplicates (numerical tolerance)
    unique_roots = []
    for r in sorted(real_roots):
        if not unique_roots or abs(r - unique_roots[-1]) > 1e-10:
            unique_roots.append(r)
    
    return unique_roots

def compute_sum():
    roots = solve_equation()
    total = 0.0
    for x in roots:
        term = x**2 + (1-x)**2
        total += term  # term is already real since x is real
    return total

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = compute_sum()
    print(f"Sum of real parts: {result}")
