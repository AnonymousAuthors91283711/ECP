theorem olympiadbench2352 (x : ℚ) (h : x + 1/x = 13/6) :
    x^2 + 1/x^2 = olympiadbench2352_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x = 2/3, x² + 1/x² = 97/36
x = 3/2, x² + 1/x² = 97/36
x = 2/3, x² + 1/x² = 97/36
x = 3/2, x² + 1/x² = 97/36
x = 2/3, x² + 1/x² = 97/36
x = 2/3, x² + 1/x² = 97/36
x = 3/2, x² + 1/x² = 97/36
x = 2/3, x² + 1/x² = 97/36
x = 3/2, x² + 1/x² = 97/36
x = 2/3, x² + 1/x² = 97/36
x = 3/2, x² + 1/x² = 97/36
x = 3/2, x² + 1/x² = 97/36

Final answer: 97/36. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<97/36>>>
