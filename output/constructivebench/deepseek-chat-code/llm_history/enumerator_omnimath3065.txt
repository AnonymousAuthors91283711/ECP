This problem is a simple equation to solve for an unknown natural number. The equation is `2 * 3 * 4 = 6 * x`, and we need to find the value of `x`. We can compute this directly by evaluating both sides.

```python
# Compute 2*3*4 and 6*x, find x where they are equal
left_side = 2 * 3 * 4
x = 1
while True:
    right_side = 6 * x
    if left_side == right_side:
        print(f"Found solution: x = {x}")
        break
    x += 1
```
