This problem asks for the number of functions f from Fin 9 â†’ Fin 9 where every element has order dividing 5 (i.e., f^5 is the identity). We'll enumerate all such functions by considering the possible cycle decompositions.

The approach:
1. Generate all possible partitions of 9 (number of elements) where each cycle length divides 5
2. For each partition, calculate the number of permutations with that cycle structure
3. Sum all valid configurations

Since cycle lengths must divide 5, only cycles of length 1 or 5 are possible.

```python
from math import factorial, comb
from collections import defaultdict

def count_functions():
    total = 0
    # We can have between 0 and 1 full 5-cycles (since 9//5=1)
    for k in [0, 1]:  # number of 5-cycles
        remaining = 9 - 5*k
        if remaining < 0:
            continue
        # The rest must be fixed points (1-cycles)
        # Calculate number of ways to choose elements for 5-cycles
        ways = comb(9, 5*k)
        # Number of ways to arrange k 5-cycles
        cycle_arrangements = factorial(5*k) // ((5**k) * factorial(k))
        # Fixed points can be assigned arbitrarily
        fixed_points = 1  # identity assignment
        total += ways * cycle_arrangements * (9 ** remaining)
    print(total)

count_functions()
```
