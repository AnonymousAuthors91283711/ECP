[write_program]
This problem involves simplifying a polynomial expression and finding its closed form. The given expression is `(3x-2)(4x+1) - (3x-2)*4x + 1`. We'll write a Python program to expand and simplify this expression symbolically to verify the simplified form.

The program will:
1. Define the original expression
2. Expand and simplify it step by step
3. Print the simplified form

```python
from sympy import symbols, expand, simplify

x = symbols('x')
# Original expression: (3x-2)(4x+1) - (3x-2)*4x + 1
expr = (3*x - 2)*(4*x + 1) - (3*x - 2)*4*x + 1

# Expand each part
part1 = expand((3*x - 2)*(4*x + 1))
part2 = expand((3*x - 2)*4*x)
simplified = expand(part1 - part2 + 1)

print("Simplified expression:", simplified)
```
