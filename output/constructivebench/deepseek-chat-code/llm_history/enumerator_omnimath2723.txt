[write_program]
This problem involves finding the value of d given that a, b, c, d are natural numbers in arithmetic progression with a common difference of 6, and their sum is 120. We'll write a Python program to solve for d by expressing all variables in terms of a and solving the equation.

The key steps are:
1. Express b, c, d in terms of a using the arithmetic progression condition
2. Substitute into the sum equation a + b + c + d = 120
3. Solve for a, then compute d
4. Since we're dealing with natural numbers, we'll verify the solution is integer

```python
def solve():
    # Given b = a + 6, c = b + 6 = a + 12, d = c + 6 = a + 18
    # Sum equation: a + (a+6) + (a+12) + (a+18) = 120
    # Simplifies to 4a + 36 = 120 => 4a = 84 => a = 21
    a = 21
    b = a + 6
    c = b + 6
    d = c + 6
    print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}, c = {c}, d = {d}")
    print(f"Verification: sum = {a + b + c + d} (should be 120)")
    print(f"Final answer: d = {d}")

solve()
