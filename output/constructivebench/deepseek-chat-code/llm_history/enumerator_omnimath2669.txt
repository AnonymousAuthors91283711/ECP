[write_program]
This problem simplifies to finding the value of x² + 2x - x(x+1). Let's enumerate the simplified form for small natural numbers to observe the pattern.

The Python program will:
1. Compute the expression for x from 0 to 20
2. Print each result to show the pattern
3. The simplified form is actually just x (since x² + 2x - x² - x = x)

```python
def compute_expression(x):
    return x**2 + 2*x - x*(x + 1)

# Enumerate results for x from 0 to 20
for x in range(21):
    result = compute_expression(x)
    print(f"x = {x}: {result}")

# The pattern clearly shows the result equals x
```
