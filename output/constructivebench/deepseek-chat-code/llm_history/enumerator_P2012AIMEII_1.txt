[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of positive integer solutions (m, n) to the equation 20m + 12n = 2012. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all valid (m, n) pairs and count them.

The approach is:
1. Solve for n in terms of m: n = (2012 - 20m)/12
2. Iterate m from 1 upwards until 20m exceeds 2012
3. For each m, check if (2012 - 20m) is divisible by 12 and positive
4. Count all valid pairs

```python
def count_solutions():
    count = 0
    max_m = 2012 // 20  # Maximum possible m where 20m < 2012
    for m in range(1, max_m + 1):
        remainder = 2012 - 20 * m
        if remainder > 0 and remainder % 12 == 0:
            n = remainder // 12
            if n > 0:
                count += 1
                print(f"Found solution: m={m}, n={n}")  # Stream partial results
    print(f"Total number of solutions: {count}")  # Final count

count_solutions()
```
