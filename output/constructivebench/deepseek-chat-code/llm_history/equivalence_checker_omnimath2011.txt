Ground Truth Answer: 2^35
Proposed Answer: 2^(20 + 16 - 1)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer \(2^{20 + 16 - 1}\) simplifies to \(2^{35}\), which matches the ground truth answer \(2^{35}\). The problem involves counting configurations of a 20x16 grid where each cell's state is determined by the XOR of row and column flips. The number of independent choices is \(2^{19}\) for rows (since one row's flip can be determined by the others) and \(2^{16}\) for columns, giving \(2^{19 + 16} = 2^{35}\) total configurations. The proposed answer correctly captures this.
