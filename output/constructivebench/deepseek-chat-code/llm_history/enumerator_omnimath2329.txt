[write_program]
This problem asks for prime numbers p where the cubic equation x³ - 3x + 1 ≡ 0 mod p has exactly one solution in the range [1, p]. We'll write a Python program to find such primes by checking each prime and counting solutions to the equation.

The approach:
1. Generate primes up to a reasonable limit (we'll use 100)
2. For each prime, test all values a from 1 to p-1
3. Count how many satisfy a³ - 3a + 1 ≡ 0 mod p
4. Output primes with exactly one solution

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]:
        if n % p == 0:
            return n == p
    d = n - 1
    s = 0
    while d % 2 == 0:
        d //= 2
        s += 1
    for a in [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]:
        if a >= n:
            continue
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(s - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False
    return True

max_prime = 100
print(f"Checking primes up to {max_prime}:")
for p in range(2, max_prime + 1):
    if not is_prime(p):
        continue
    solutions = 0
    for a in range(1, p):
        if (a**3 - 3*a + 1) % p == 0:
            solutions += 1
    if solutions == 1:
        print(f"Found prime with exactly one solution: {p}")
print("Search complete.")
```
