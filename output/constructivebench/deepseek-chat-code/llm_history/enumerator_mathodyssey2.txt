This problem involves finding the smallest natural number `l` such that the product `A(l)` is divisible by `5^(25*l)` but not by `5^(25*l + 1)`. The product `A(l)` is defined from `4*l + 1` to `4*(5^5 + 1)*l`. 

To approach this, we'll:
1. Compute the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of `A(l)` for increasing `l`
2. Check when it first equals `25*l`

We'll use Legendre's formula to count the exponent of 5 in the factorial, then adapt it for the product range.

```python
def exponent_in_factorial(p, n):
    """Compute exponent of prime p in n! using Legendre's formula"""
    e = 0
    power = p
    while power <= n:
        e += n // power
        power *= p
    return e

def exponent_in_product(p, a, b):
    """Exponent of p in product from a to b (inclusive)"""
    return exponent_in_factorial(p, b) - exponent_in_factorial(p, a - 1)

def find_min_l():
    p = 5
    target_exp = 25
    l = 1
    while True:
        a = 4 * l + 1
        b = 4 * (5**5 + 1) * l
        exp = exponent_in_product(p, a, b)
        print(f"l={l}, exponent={exp}, target={target_exp*l}")
        if exp == target_exp * l:
            # Verify it's not divisible by next power
            if exp + 1 != exponent_in_product(p, a, b + 1):
                print(f"Found minimal l: {l}")
                return l
        l += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_l()
```
