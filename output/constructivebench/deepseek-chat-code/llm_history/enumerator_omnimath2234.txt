[write_program]
This problem involves finding the smallest natural number `n` such that the minimal `P` (defined by a linear combination) for `n+2` is strictly less than the minimal `P` for `n`. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of `n` and compute the corresponding `P` values to find the smallest such `n`.

The approach:
1. For each `n`, find all non-negative integer solutions (a,b) to 6a + 10b = n
2. For each solution, compute P = 7a + 12b
3. Find the minimal P for each n
4. Compare P(n+2) with P(n) to find the smallest n where P(n+2) < P(n)

```python
def find_minimal_n():
    max_n = 100  # Reasonable upper bound based on problem nature
    
    # Precompute minimal P for each n up to max_n+2
    min_P = {}
    for n in range(0, max_n + 3):
        current_min = float('inf')
        # Find all non-negative integer solutions to 6a + 10b = n
        max_a = n // 6 + 1
        max_b = n // 10 + 1
        for a in range(0, max_a + 1):
            for b in range(0, max_b + 1):
                if 6*a + 10*b == n:
                    P = 7*a + 12*b
                    if P < current_min:
                        current_min = P
        min_P[n] = current_min
    
    # Find the smallest n where min_P[n+2] < min_P[n]
    for n in range(0, max_n + 1):
        if min_P[n+2] < min_P[n]:
            print(f"Found candidate n = {n}")
            print(f"P({n}) = {min_P[n]}, P({n+2}) = {min_P[n+2]}")
            return
    
    print("No solution found in the search range")

find_minimal_n()
```
