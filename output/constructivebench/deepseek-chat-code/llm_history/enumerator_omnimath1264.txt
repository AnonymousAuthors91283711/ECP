[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number k that can be expressed as the sum of three floor functions of symmetric expressions involving positive real numbers a, b, c. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible k values by testing small integer values of a, b, c to find the minimal k.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible integer values of a, b, c (up to a reasonable limit)
2. For each combination, compute the floor function sum
3. Track the minimal k found
4. Output intermediate results and finally the minimal k

```python
def main():
    min_k = float('inf')
    max_n = 20  # reasonable upper bound for a,b,c
    
    for a in range(1, max_n + 1):
        for b in range(1, max_n + 1):
            for c in range(1, max_n + 1):
                term1 = (a + b) // c
                term2 = (b + c) // a
                term3 = (c + a) // b
                k = term1 + term2 + term3
                if k < min_k:
                    min_k = k
                    print(f"New minimal k={k} found at a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
    
    # Also check non-integer cases by scaling
    # We'll test simple rational ratios up to denominator 3
    for denom in range(1, 4):
        for a_num in range(1, 4*denom + 1):
            a = a_num / denom
            for b_num in range(1, 4*denom + 1):
                b = b_num / denom
                for c_num in range(1, 4*denom + 1):
                    c = c_num / denom
                    term1 = int((a + b) // c)
                    term2 = int((b + c) // a)
                    term3 = int((c + a) // b)
                    k = term1 + term2 + term3
                    if k < min_k:
                        min_k = k
                        print(f"New minimal k={k} found at a={a}, b={b}, c={c} (rational)")
    
    print(f"\nThe minimal k found is: {min_k}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
