Based on the problem statement, we're looking for the minimum number of marked points on an n×n grid (with n even) such that every point is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to at least one marked point. This is equivalent to finding a minimal dominating set for the grid graph.

For even n, the minimal dominating set forms a checkerboard pattern where we mark every other point in a staggered fashion. The closed form solution is:

<<<fun n : ℕ => n^2 / 2>>>
