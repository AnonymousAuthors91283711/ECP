[write_program]
This problem asks to find all quadruples (a,b,c,d) of natural numbers where a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d and the three expressions {a*b + c*d, a*c + b*d, a*d + b*c} equal exactly {40, 70, 100}. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible quadruples up to reasonable bounds and check the conditions.

The approach is:
1. Iterate through all possible a,b,c,d with a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d
2. For each combination, compute the three expressions
3. Check if the resulting set matches {40,70,100}
4. Print valid combinations as they're found

```python
def solve():
    target = {40, 70, 100}
    found = False
    # Reasonable upper bound since a*b + c*d >= 40 and a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d
    max_d = 20  
    for a in range(1, max_d + 1):
        for b in range(a, max_d + 1):
            for c in range(b, max_d + 1):
                for d in range(c, max_d + 1):
                    s1 = a*b + c*d
                    s2 = a*c + b*d
                    s3 = a*d + b*c
                    if {s1, s2, s3} == target:
                        print(f"Found solution: ({a}, {b}, {c}, {d})")
                        found = True
    if not found:
        print("No solutions found")

solve()
