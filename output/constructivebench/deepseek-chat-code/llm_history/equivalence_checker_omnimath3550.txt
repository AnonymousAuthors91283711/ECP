Ground Truth Answer: {m : ℤ | ∃ k : ℤ, k^2 = m ∨ 2*k^2 = m}
Proposed Answer: {m : ℤ | ∃ k : ℤ, m = k^2 ∨ m = k^2 + 2 * k}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

The problem is about finding all integer values m for which the polynomial P(m) = X⁴ - (2m+4)X² + (m-2)² can be factored into two non-constant polynomials A and B.

The ground truth answer says m must be either a perfect square (k²) or twice a perfect square (2k²).

The proposed answer says m must be either a perfect square (k²) or of the form k² + 2k.

Let's test some values:
1. For m=1: 
   - Ground truth: valid (1=1²)
   - Proposed: valid (1=1²)
2. For m=2:
   - Ground truth: valid (2=2*1²)
   - Proposed: valid (2=0²+2*0)
3. For m=4:
   - Ground truth: valid (4=2²)
   - Proposed: valid (4=2²)
4. For m=8:
   - Ground truth: valid (8=2*2²)
   - Proposed: invalid (no integer k satisfies 8=k²+2k)
5. For m=0:
   - Ground truth: valid (0=0²)
   - Proposed: valid (0=0² or 0=(-2)²+2*(-2))
6. For m=3:
   - Ground truth: invalid
   - Proposed: invalid

The proposed answer fails for m=8 (which should be included but isn't) and includes some values that the ground truth doesn't (like m=-1 which is (-1)²+2*(-1) but isn't a perfect square or twice one).
