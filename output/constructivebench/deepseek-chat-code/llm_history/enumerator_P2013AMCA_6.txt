This problem is about finding the total points scored by a basketball player given constraints on shot attempts and made percentages. We need to enumerate all possible combinations of 3-point and 2-point attempts that sum to 30, calculate the made shots based on the given percentages, and compute the total points.

The program will:
1. Iterate through all possible combinations of 3-point and 2-point attempts that sum to 30
2. Calculate made shots using integer division (3-point made = attempts//5, 2-point made = 3*attempts//10)
3. Compute total points and track all possible values
4. Output each valid combination and its points
5. Finally output the unique total points value that satisfies all conditions

```python
def main():
    total_attempts = 30
    unique_points = set()
    
    for three_pt_attempts in range(0, total_attempts + 1):
        two_pt_attempts = total_attempts - three_pt_attempts
        
        # Calculate made shots using integer division
        three_pt_made = three_pt_attempts // 5
        two_pt_made = (3 * two_pt_attempts) // 10
        
        # Calculate total points
        total_points = 3 * three_pt_made + 2 * two_pt_made
        
        # Print each valid combination
        print(f"3pt: {three_pt_attempts}, 2pt: {two_pt_attempts} -> Points: {total_points}")
        unique_points.add(total_points)
    
    # Print all unique point totals found
    print("\nPossible point totals:", sorted(unique_points))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
