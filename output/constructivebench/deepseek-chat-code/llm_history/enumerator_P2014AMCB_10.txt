This problem asks to find a 3-digit number ABC (where A is 1-9, B,C are 0-9) such that:
1. A+B+C ≤ 7
2. ABC + 55*t = CBA for some positive integer t
3. The sum of squares A²+B²+C² is to be maximized (since it's set equal to P2014AMCB_10_answer which we need to find)

We'll enumerate all possible ABC numbers meeting the first two conditions, then find the maximum sum of squares among them.

```python
def reverse_num(n):
    return int(str(n)[::-1])

max_sum_squares = 0
best_numbers = []

for a in range(1, 10):
    for b in range(0, 10):
        for c in range(0, 10):
            if a + b + c > 7:
                continue
            abc = 100*a + 10*b + c
            cba = 100*c + 10*b + a
            diff = cba - abc
            if diff > 0 and diff % 55 == 0:
                t = diff // 55
                sum_squares = a*a + b*b + c*c
                print(f"Found: {abc} (t={t}), sum of squares: {sum_squares}")
                if sum_squares > max_sum_squares:
                    max_sum_squares = sum_squares
                    best_numbers = [abc]
                elif sum_squares == max_sum_squares:
                    best_numbers.append(abc)

print(f"\nMaximum sum of squares: {max_sum_squares}")
print(f"Numbers achieving this: {best_numbers}")
```
