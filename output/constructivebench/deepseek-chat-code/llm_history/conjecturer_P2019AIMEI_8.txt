Based on the problem statement and error message, I need to provide a pair of natural numbers (ℕ × ℕ) that satisfies the given trigonometric equation and conditions. The error occurs because the delimiter syntax is incorrect for Lean.

The problem involves trigonometric identities and simplification. Given the equation sin¹⁰x + cos¹⁰x = 11/36, we need to find sin¹²x + cos¹²x in reduced form.

Through trigonometric identities and algebraic manipulation (though not shown here), we can derive that sin¹²x + cos¹²x = 13/54. This satisfies:
1. The fraction is reduced (13 and 54 are coprime)
2. The sum 13 + 54 = 67

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<(13, 54)>>>

The error was using angle brackets ⟨⟩ instead of parentheses () for the pair, and incorrect delimiter syntax. The correct Lean syntax for a pair is (a, b), not ⟨a, b⟩ in this context.
