abbrev omnimath685_answer : Set (List Bool) := sorry
theorem omnimath685 (s : List Bool) : 
  s ∈ omnimath685_answer ↔ 
  s.length = 8 ∧ ∀ t ∈ omnimath685_answer, s ≠ t → 3 ≤ List.length (List.filter (fun (p : Bool × Bool) => p.fst ≠ p.snd) (List.zip s t)) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: timeout triggered. Expected Answer Type: Set (List Bool)
Based on the problem statement, we're looking for a set of binary lists of length 8 where any two distinct lists differ in at least 3 positions. This is equivalent to a binary code of length 8 with minimum Hamming distance 3. The Hadamard code (extended to length 8) fits this description.

<<<{l : List Bool | l.length = 8 ∧ ∃ (f : Fin 8 → Bool), ∀ i, l.get i = f i ∧ (∀ x y, f x = f y → x = y) ∨ (∀ x y, f x ≠ f y → x = y)}>>>
