From the enumerated solutions, we observe that p is always 2, and x and y follow patterns where either:
1. x = y (even numbers)
2. x + y = 2^k (for some k)
3. The solutions seem to relate to powers of 2 minus 1

The general solution appears to be all triples where p=2 and x,y are positive integers satisfying certain power relationships.

Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)
Looking at the enumerated answers, we can observe a clear pattern when p=2:
1. Solutions where x = y (diagonal cases)
2. Solutions where x + y = 2^k for some k (off-diagonal cases)

The error in the original proposed answer comes from incorrect syntax for set builder notation in Lean. We need to properly pattern match the triple (p, x, y) and use proper logical connectives.

Here's the corrected version:

<<<{(p, x, y) : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ | p = 2 ∧ x > 0 ∧ y > 0 ∧ (x = y ∨ ∃ k : ℕ, x + y = 2 ^ k)}>>>

Explanation:
1. Fixed syntax by properly declaring the type of the triple (p, x, y)
2. Used proper logical connectives (∧ for AND, ∨ for OR)
3. Maintained the same logical structure: p must be 2, x and y positive, and either x=y or x+y is a power of 2
4. The pattern matches all enumerated solutions shown
5. The answer is in closed form and generalizes the observed pattern
