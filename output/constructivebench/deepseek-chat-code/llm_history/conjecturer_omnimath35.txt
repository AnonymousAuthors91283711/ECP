. Expected Answer Type: ℤ × ℤ × ℤ → ℤ
From the enumerated answers, the pattern shows the formula works for non-square numbers but fails for square numbers. The simplest operation that fits this pattern is x*y + z. The other operations either fail for some non-squares or work for some squares.

<<<fun (x, y, z) => x * y + z>>>
