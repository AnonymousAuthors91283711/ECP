This problem asks for the minimum value of the function (x² + 6x + 2)². We'll approach this by:

1. Finding the minimum of the inner quadratic x² + 6x + 2
2. Then squaring that minimum to get our answer
3. Enumerating possible x values around the vertex to verify

The vertex of x² + 6x + 2 occurs at x = -b/(2a) = -6/2 = -3. We'll check values around this point.

```python
def f(x):
    return (x**2 + 6*x + 2)**2

# Check values around the vertex at x = -3
for x in [-4, -3.5, -3.1, -3.01, -3, -2.99, -2.9, -2.5, -2]:
    y = f(x)
    print(f"x = {x:.3f}, y = {y:.6f}")

# The minimum occurs at x = -3
min_value = f(-3)
print(f"\nMinimum value found: {min_value}")
```
