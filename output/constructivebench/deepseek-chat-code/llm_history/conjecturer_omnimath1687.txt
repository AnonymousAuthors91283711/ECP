Found valid triple: p=3, q=11, r=5. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the given equations and enumerated answer, we can deduce that A must be the product p*q*r. For the found triple (3,11,5), this gives 165. The equations simplify to conditions that are satisfied by this triple.

Found valid triple: p=3, q=11, r=5. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the problem statement and the enumerated answer (p=3, q=11, r=5), we can see that the solution involves finding the product p*q*r. However, the error occurs because p, q, r are parameters in the theorem but not available in the abbreviation definition.

The solution is to make omnimath1687_answer a function that takes p, q, r as arguments and returns their product. This matches the theorem's structure where p, q, r are given as parameters.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<fun (p q r : ℕ) => p * q * r>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem involves three distinct primes p, q, r that satisfy certain equations
2. The enumerated answer shows the solution is indeed the product p*q*r (3*11*5=165)
3. The original error occurred because p, q, r weren't in scope in the abbreviation
4. Making it a function of p, q, r properly captures the relationship shown in the theorem
5. This matches the pattern seen in the enumerated answer while being general for any valid p, q, r[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

. Enumerated Answers: Searching for valid prime triples (p, q, r)...
Found valid triple: p=3, q=11, r=5. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the problem statement and error message, I understand that:
1. The answer should be a single natural number (ℕ), not a function
2. The enumerated answer shows a valid triple (3,11,5)
3. The equations simplify to p=3, q=11, r=5
4. The answer should be the product p*q*r

The error occurs because we're trying to define a function when we need a constant. Since the equations uniquely determine p,q,r (as seen in the enumerated answer), we can directly compute the answer.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<3 * 11 * 5>>>

Explanation:
- The system of equations reduces to p=3, q=11, r=5
- The answer is simply their product 165
- This matches the enumerated solution
- The type is now correctly ℕ instead of a function type
