Based on the error message and the enumerated answers, the issue is that Lean requires noncomputable declarations when working with real numbers (ℝ) due to their inherent computational complexity. The proposed answer 72459/2 is correct mathematically, but needs to be marked as noncomputable.

The solution involves:
1. Solving for p from the given equation (3*p - q) - p = (3*p + q) - (3*p - q)
2. Substituting q = 9 to find p = 27/2
3. Calculating the final expression (3*p + q) + 2010 * ((3*p + q) - (3*p - q)) = 99/2 + 2010*18 = 72459/2

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable def P2010AMCA_10_answer : ℝ := 72459 / 2>>>

The noncomputable annotation tells Lean that this real number cannot be computed algorithmically, which resolves the compilation error while maintaining mathematical correctness. The value 72459/2 matches the enumerated results exactly.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Final result = 72459/2. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Looking at the problem and enumerated answers, we can see:
1. From hq, q = 9
2. The sequence condition simplifies to (2p - 9) = (9)
3. Solving gives p = 9
4. Then 3p + q = 36
5. And (3p+q)-(3p-q) = 18
6. Final expression evaluates to 36 + 2010*18 = 36 + 36180 = 36216

However, the enumerated answers show p=27/2 leading to 72459/2. This suggests the sequence condition might have been interpreted differently. The key is to properly solve the sequence equation first.

The correct solution path should be:
1. From hseq: (3p - q) - p = (3p + q) - (3p - q)
   Simplifies to: 2p - q = 2q ⇒ 2p = 3q
2. With q=9, p=27/2
3. Then 3p+q = 81/2 + 18/2 = 99/2
4. (3p+q)-(3p-q) = 99/2 - 63/2 = 18
5. Final expression: 99/2 + 2010*18 = 99/2 + 36180 = 72459/2

Looking at the problem and enumerated answers:
1. We have q = 9 from hq
2. The sequence condition simplifies to (2p - 9) = (2q) ⇒ 2p - 9 = 18 ⇒ p = 27/2
3. Then (3p + q) = 99/2
4. The difference (3p+q)-(3p-q) = 2q = 18
5. Final expression evaluates to 99/2 + 2010*18 = 99/2 + 36180 = 72459/2

The error occurs because Lean needs to mark real number division as noncomputable. Here's the fixed answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2010AMCA_10_answer : ℝ := 72459 / 2>>>

The answer is correct because:
1. Following the given conditions leads to p = 27/2
2. Substituting into the final expression gives 72459/2
3. The noncomputable annotation is needed for real division in Lean[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the error message and the enumerated answers, the issue is that Lean requires noncomputable operations for real number division. The answer 72459/2 is correct mathematically, but needs to be marked as noncomputable in Lean since it involves real division.

Here's the fixed version:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2010AMCA_10_answer : ℝ := 72459 / 2>>>

Explanation:
1. The error indicates we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it uses real number division
2. The enumerated answers show:
   - p = 27/2 (from solving the sequence equation)
   - 3p+q = 99/2 (substituting p and q=9)
   - The difference term is 18 (99/2 - (81/2-9) = 18)
   - Final calculation: 99/2 + 2010*18 = 99/2 + 36180 = 72459/2
3. The answer is mathematically correct and matches the enumerated results
4. The noncomputable annotation resolves the Lean compilation error while preserving the mathematical meaning
