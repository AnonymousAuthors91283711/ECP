Looking at the recurrence relation and initial conditions, we can observe a pattern:
1. The sequence alternates between positive and negative values
2. The absolute values seem to follow a repeating pattern every 3 terms
3. For n ≡ 2 mod 3, the value is 1/√3

Since 2009 mod 3 is 2 (2009 = 3*669 + 2), we can conjecture that |a 2009| = 1/√3. The error occurs because Real.sqrt is noncomputable in Lean, so we need to mark the definition as noncomputable.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2009AMCA_25_answer : ℝ := 1 / Real.sqrt 3>>>

Explanation:
1. The recurrence relation and initial conditions create a periodic pattern in absolute values
2. Observing the pattern shows that every 3rd term starting from n=2 has absolute value 1/√3
3. Since 2009 ≡ 2 mod 3, it falls into this category
4. The noncomputable annotation is needed because Real.sqrt is noncomputable in Lean's logic[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem and the enumerated answers, we can observe a pattern:
1. The sequence starts with a[1] = 1 and a[2] = 1/√3
2. The recurrence relation is a(n+2) = a(n+1)² - a(n)
3. The problem asks for |a(2009)|

From the recurrence relation and initial conditions, we can see the sequence alternates between positive and negative values, but the magnitude seems to stabilize around 1/√3. The enumerated values show a[1] = 1 and a[2] ≈ 0.57735 (which is 1/√3).

Given that the sequence appears to converge in magnitude to 1/√3, and considering the problem asks for the absolute value, the most likely answer is 1/√3. The error message suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real number operations.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2009AMCA_25_answer : ℝ := 1 / Real.sqrt 3>>>

The explanation is that the sequence appears to converge in magnitude to 1/√3 based on the initial terms and recurrence relation, and we need the noncomputable annotation because we're working with real numbers in Lean.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
