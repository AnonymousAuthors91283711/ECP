theorem olympiadbench2738 (hS : Set.Finite {x : ℝ | 0 < x ∧ log x = (3 + ⌊(log x)^2⌋) / 4}) :
  let P := ∏ x in hS.toFinset, x
  ∃ y : ℝ, P = (10 : ℝ)^y ∧ y = olympiadbench2738_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found solution: x = 5.623413251903491 (log10(x) = 0.75)
Found solution: x = 10.0 (log10(x) = 1.0)
Found solution: x = 1000.0 (log10(x) = 3.0)
Found solution: x = 1778.2794100389228 (log10(x) = 3.25)
Product of solutions: 100000000.00000001 = 10^8.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
