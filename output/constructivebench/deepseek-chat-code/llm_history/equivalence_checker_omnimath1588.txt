Ground Truth Answer: (sqrt 2 - 1) * (sqrt 3 + sqrt 2)
Proposed Answer: 1 / tan (π / 12)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

First, let's evaluate both expressions numerically:

1. Ground truth: (√2 - 1)(√3 + √2) ≈ (1.4142 - 1)(1.7320 + 1.4142) ≈ 0.4142 * 3.1462 ≈ 1.3032

2. Proposed answer: 1/tan(π/12) = cot(π/12)
π/12 radians = 15 degrees
cot(15°) ≈ 3.7321

The numerical values are clearly different (1.3032 vs 3.7321), so the answers are not equivalent.

Moreover, we can verify this algebraically:
- cot(π/12) = cot(15°) = 2 + √3
- (√2 - 1)(√3 + √2) = √6 + 2 - √3 - √2 ≈ 2.449 + 2 - 1.732 - 1.414 ≈ 1.303

These are fundamentally different expressions with different values.
