No solutions found in random trials









. Expected Answer Type: Bool
Based on the problem statement and the enumerated results showing no non-constant fixed points found after 10 iterations, the answer should be false since no such function exists. The problem is essentially asking whether there exists a non-constant function that's invariant under 10 applications of the averaging operation, and the empirical evidence suggests this isn't possible.
