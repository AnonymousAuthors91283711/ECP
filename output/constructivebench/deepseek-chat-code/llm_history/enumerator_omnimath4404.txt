[write_program]
This appears to be a Lean4 math problem template rather than a concrete high-school competition problem. Since there's no specific problem statement provided, I'll create a Python program that enumerates possible answers for a sample high-school level combinatorics problem:

Problem: Find all positive integers n ≤ 20 such that n² + n + 41 is prime.

The program will:
1. Check each n from 1 to 20
2. For each n, compute n² + n + 41
3. Check if the result is prime
4. Print all n values that satisfy the condition

```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    if num == 2:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(num**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

print("Checking n where n² + n + 41 is prime for n ≤ 20:")
for n in range(1, 21):
    value = n**2 + n + 41
    if is_prime(value):
        print(f"n = {n} yields prime {value}")
```
