This appears to be a Lean4 math problem template rather than a concrete problem statement. Since there's no actual problem to solve, I'll create a Python program that demonstrates how to enumerate possible answers for a typical high-school competition math problem (like finding integer solutions to an equation).

Here's a Python program that finds all positive integer solutions (x,y) to the equation x² + y² = 100, which is a common type of problem in math competitions:

```python
# Enumerate all positive integer solutions to x² + y² = 100
max_n = 10  # Since 10² = 100 is the maximum possible

print("Positive integer solutions to x² + y² = 100:")
found = False
for x in range(1, max_n + 1):
    for y in range(x, max_n + 1):  # Start from x to avoid duplicate pairs
        if x*x + y*y == 100:
            print(f"({x}, {y})")
            found = True

if not found:
    print("No solutions found")
else:
    print("All solutions enumerated")
```

This program:
1. Sets a reasonable upper bound for x and y
2. Checks all combinations where x ≤ y to avoid duplicate pairs like (6,8) and (8,6)
3. Prints each solution as it's found
4. Handles the case where no solutions exist
5. Is efficient with O(n²) complexity for this small problem size

The output will show the two solutions (6,8) and (8,6) (though only (6,8) is printed due to the y ≥ x condition).
