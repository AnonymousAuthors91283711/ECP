abbrev omnimath263_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath263 (n : ℕ) (hn : n > 0) :
  (∃ (k : ℕ) (hk : k ≥ 2) (a : Fin k → ℚ) (ha : ∀ i, 0 < a i),
    (∑ i, a i = n) ∧ (∏ i, a i = n)) ↔ n ∈ omnimath263_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking n values up to 100:
4

Valid n values found: [4]. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{n | ∃ k, n = k ^ k}>>> 

Explanation: The enumerated answer suggests only 4 works (2²). The pattern indicates numbers that are perfect powers of themselves (k^k). This matches the product and sum conditions since for k=2: 2+2=4 and 2*2=4.
