[write_program]
This problem asks to find all integer pairs (m, n) that satisfy the equation m⁵ - n⁵ = 16mn. We'll write a Python program to search for such pairs within a reasonable range.

Approach:
1. Iterate through possible integer values of m and n within a symmetric range around 0
2. For each pair, check if the equation holds
3. Print valid pairs as they are found
4. Since higher absolute values make the left side grow much faster than the right, we can limit our search to a modest range

```python
def find_solutions():
    # Search range - adjust if needed
    search_range = 100
    print(f"Searching for solutions in range [-{search_range}, {search_range}]")
    
    for m in range(-search_range, search_range + 1):
        for n in range(-search_range, search_range + 1):
            if m == 0 and n == 0:
                continue  # trivial case
            lhs = m**5 - n**5
            rhs = 16 * m * n
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"Found solution: (m, n) = ({m}, {n})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solutions()
```
