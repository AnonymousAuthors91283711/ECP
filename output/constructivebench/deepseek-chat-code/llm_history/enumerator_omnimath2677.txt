[write_program]
This problem appears to be a simple rational arithmetic problem where we need to compute (3 + 6)/(3 * 6). The solution can be found by direct computation. Here's a Python program that computes and prints the exact rational value:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Compute (3 + 6) / (3 * 6)
numerator = 3 + 6
denominator = 3 * 6
result = Fraction(numerator, denominator)

# Simplify and print the exact rational value
print(result)
```

The program uses Python's `fractions.Fraction` to maintain exact rational arithmetic and automatically simplifies the result. The output will be the simplified form of 9/18, which is 1/2.
