[write_program]
This problem involves evaluating an infinite series of binomial coefficients with an exponential term. To assist in conjecturing the closed-form answer, we can compute partial sums of the series and observe their convergence. The program will compute partial sums up to a reasonable threshold and print them to help identify a pattern.

```python
import math

def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
    return math.comb(n, k)

def partial_sum(N):
    total = 0.0
    for n in range(N + 1):
        term = binomial_coefficient(2 * n, n) * (1 / (5 ** n))
        total += term
        # Print partial sums at powers of 2 for efficiency
        if n & (n - 1) == 0 or n == N:  # Check if n is power of 2 or last term
            print(f"S_{n} = {total}")
    return total

# Compute partial sums up to N=32 (sufficient for convergence observation)
partial_sum(32)
```
