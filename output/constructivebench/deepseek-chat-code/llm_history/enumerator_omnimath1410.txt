[write_program]
The problem involves a recursive sequence x(n) defined using the function M(a,b) = lcm(a,b)/gcd(a,b). We need to find how many integers n between 2 and 2021 satisfy the equation 5x(n)² + 5x(n+1)² = 26x(n)x(n+1).

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Compute the x(n) sequence up to n=2022
2. Check the equation for each n from 2 to 2021
3. Count the number of satisfying n values

```python
import math

def compute_x_sequence(max_n):
    x = [0, 1]  # x(0) and x(1)
    for n in range(2, max_n + 1):
        a = n
        b = x[-1]
        gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
        lcm_ab = a * b // gcd_ab
        M = lcm_ab // gcd_ab
        x.append(M)
    return x

def main():
    max_n = 2022
    x = compute_x_sequence(max_n)
    count = 0
    
    for n in range(2, 2021 + 1):
        xn = x[n]
        xn1 = x[n + 1]
        lhs = 5 * xn**2 + 5 * xn1**2
        rhs = 26 * xn * xn1
        if lhs == rhs:
            print(f"Found solution at n = {n}")
            count += 1
    
    print(f"Total solutions found: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
