The problem is to find the natural number `n` such that `12 = (1/2) * n` and prove it's unique. This is a simple linear equation where we can solve for `n` directly. The Python program will enumerate natural numbers and check the condition, though in this case we know the exact solution is `n = 24`.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers n where 12 = (1/2)*n
def find_n():
    for n in range(1, 100):  # Reasonable upper bound
        if 12 == (1/2) * n:
            print(f"Found candidate: {n}")
    print("Enumeration complete")

find_n()
```
