[write_program]
This problem involves finding all real numbers x that satisfy a trigonometric equation, parameterized by integers m. The equation simplifies to an identity involving sin(x) and cos(x). We'll write a Python program to numerically verify potential solutions by testing integer values of m and checking the equation.

The approach:
1. Test small integer values of m (both positive and negative)
2. For each m, compute x using the omnimath4406_answer function (which we don't know, but we can test simple candidates)
3. Verify if the trigonometric equation holds for x
4. We'll assume omnimath4406_answer might be simple like m*π/4 since the equation simplifies to cos(2x)

```python
import math

def verify(x):
    """Check if x satisfies the trigonometric equation."""
    if math.isclose(math.sin(x), 0) or math.isclose(math.cos(x), 0):
        # Handle cases where denominators would be zero
        return False
    left = (math.sin(x)**3) * (1 + math.cos(x)/math.sin(x)) + \
           (math.cos(x)**3) * (1 + math.sin(x)/math.cos(x))
    right = math.cos(2*x)
    return math.isclose(left, right, abs_tol=1e-10)

# Test integer values of m from -10 to 10
for m in range(-10, 11):
    # Try common periodic solutions (π/4 intervals)
    for k in [1, 2, 4]:
        x = m * math.pi / k
        if verify(x):
            print(f"m={m}, x={x} (π/{k} multiple)")

    # Also test m*π itself
    x = m * math.pi
    if verify(x):
        print(f"m={m}, x={x} (π multiple)")

# Check if any non-multiples of π/4 work
for x in [0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]:
    if verify(x):
        print(f"Non-standard solution found: x={x}")
```
