[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 57 and a² mod 57 < b² mod 57. We'll write a Python program to count all such pairs by checking each possible combination.

The approach:
1. Iterate through all possible a values from 1 to 56
2. For each a, iterate through b from a+1 to 57
3. Compare (a² mod 57) with (b² mod 57)
4. Count all pairs where the condition holds

```python
def main():
    count = 0
    mod = 57
    for a in range(1, mod):
        a_sq_mod = (a * a) % mod
        for b in range(a + 1, mod + 1):
            b_sq_mod = (b * b) % mod
            if a_sq_mod < b_sq_mod:
                count += 1
    print(count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
