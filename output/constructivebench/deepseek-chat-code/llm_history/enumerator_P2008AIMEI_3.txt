This problem is about finding non-negative integers b, j, s that satisfy two linear equations and then computing the sum of their squares. We'll enumerate possible values efficiently by considering constraints from the equations.

```python
def solve():
    # Enumerate possible values of b (biscuits) first since coefficients are smaller
    max_b = min(74 // 2, 91 // 4)  # upper bounds from first and second equations
    solutions = []
    
    for b in range(0, max_b + 1):
        # Solve the system for j and s given b
        # Equations:
        # 3j + 4s = 74 - 2b  (1)
        # 2j + 3s = 91 - 4b  (2)
        
        # Using Cramer's rule to solve the 2x2 system
        det = 3*3 - 2*4  # determinant of coefficient matrix
        
        if det != 0:  # system has unique solution
            numerator_j = (74 - 2*b)*3 - (91 - 4*b)*4
            numerator_s = 3*(91 - 4*b) - 2*(74 - 2*b)
            
            if numerator_j % det == 0 and numerator_s % det == 0:
                j = numerator_j // det
                s = numerator_s // det
                
                if j >= 0 and s >= 0:  # check non-negative
                    solutions.append((b, j, s))
    
    # Print all valid solutions and their sum of squares
    for sol in solutions:
        b, j, s = sol
        sum_sq = b*b + j*j + s*s
        print(f"b={b}, j={j}, s={s}, b²+j²+s²={sum_sq}")
    
    # The problem asks for the sum of squares (which is unique from the solution)
    if solutions:
        b, j, s = solutions[0]
        print(f"\nFinal answer: {b*b + j*j + s*s}")

solve()
