Ground Truth Answer: {0}
Proposed Answer: {k : ℤ | ∃ m, k = m * 2015 * 2016 * 2017}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem states that if a cubic polynomial has an integer root, then the product of its values at 2015 and 2016 must belong to some set.

2. The ground truth answer is {0}, meaning the product must be zero.

3. The proposed answer suggests the product must be a multiple of 2015*2016*2017.

Analysis:
- If the polynomial has a root at 2015, then f(2015) = 0, making the product zero.
- If it has a root at 2016, then f(2016) = 0, making the product zero.
- If it has a root elsewhere, there's no guarantee the product would be a multiple of 2015*2016*2017.
- The only guaranteed value is zero (when either f(2015) or f(2016) is zero).

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It's too restrictive (only certain multiples are allowed when in fact any zero product satisfies)
2. It misses the main point that the product must be zero
