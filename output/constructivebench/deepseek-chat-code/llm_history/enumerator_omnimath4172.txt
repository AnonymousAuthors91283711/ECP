[write_program]
This problem is about finding 6 numbers where:
1. Any two distinct numbers have a GCD that's a prime ≤26
2. For every prime ≤26, there exists some pair of these numbers with that GCD

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible 6-number tuples and check these conditions. Since the search space is large, we'll:
1. Use small primes (≤26) as building blocks
2. Generate combinations systematically
3. Check the conditions incrementally

```python
import itertools
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23]:
        if n % p == 0:
            return n == p
    return True  # assume n ≤26

primes = [p for p in range(2, 27) if is_prime(p)]
required_primes = set(primes)

def generate_candidates():
    # Generate possible numbers as products of distinct primes
    max_factors = 3  # limit to keep numbers reasonable
    numbers = []
    for r in range(1, max_factors + 1):
        for combo in itertools.combinations(primes, r):
            numbers.append(math.prod(combo))
    return sorted(set(numbers))

numbers = generate_candidates()

def check_conditions(tuple6):
    seen_gcds = set()
    for i in range(6):
        for j in range(i + 1, 6):
            a, b = tuple6[i], tuple6[j]
            gcd = math.gcd(a, b)
            if not is_prime(gcd) or gcd > 26:
                return False
            seen_gcds.add(gcd)
    return seen_gcds == required_primes

# Search for valid 6-tuples
found = False
for candidate in itertools.combinations(numbers, 6):
    if check_conditions(candidate):
        print("Valid tuple found:", candidate)
        found = True
        break

if not found:
    print("No valid tuple found with current parameters")
```
