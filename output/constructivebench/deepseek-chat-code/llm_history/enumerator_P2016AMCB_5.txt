[write_program]
This problem asks for the remainder when (4 + 919) is divided by 7. We can compute this directly in Python using modular arithmetic. The solution is straightforward since it's just a simple calculation, but we'll write a program that demonstrates the computation and outputs the result.

```python
# Compute (4 + 919) mod 7
result = (4 + 919) % 7
print(result)
```
