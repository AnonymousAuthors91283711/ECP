abbrev omnimath3475_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3475 (x : ℝ) (hx : x < -2) :
  IsLeast {y : ℝ | y = x ∨ y = x + 2 ∨ y = (1/2) * x ∨ y = x - 2 ∨ y = 2 * x} (omnimath3475_answer x) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: For x = -3, minimum value is -6
For x = -4, minimum value is -8
For x = -5, minimum value is -10
For x = -6, minimum value is -12
For x = -7, minimum value is -14
For x = -8, minimum value is -16
For x = -9, minimum value is -18
For x = -10, minimum value is -20. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
<<<fun x : ℝ => 2 * x>>>
