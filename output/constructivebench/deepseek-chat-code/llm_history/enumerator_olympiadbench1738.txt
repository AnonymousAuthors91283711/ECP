[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number `n` such that there exists a set of `n` polynomials over ℚ where the sum of their squares evaluated at any rational `x` equals `x² + 7`. We'll write a Python program to search for the minimal `n` by testing small values and checking possible polynomial combinations.

The approach:
1. For small n (starting from 1), generate possible polynomial combinations
2. Check if their squares sum to x² + 7
3. Since the problem is over ℚ, we'll consider linear polynomials (higher degrees would make the sum too large)
4. We'll limit coefficients to small integers for practicality

```python
from sympy import symbols, Poly, expand

x = symbols('x')

def check_polynomials(polys):
    """Check if sum of squares equals x^2 + 7"""
    total = sum(p**2 for p in polys)
    return expand(total) == x**2 + 7

def find_min_n(max_n=5):
    """Search for minimal n where solution exists"""
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        print(f"Testing n = {n}")
        
        # Try combinations of linear polynomials a*x + b
        # Limit coefficient range for practical search
        coeff_range = range(-3, 4)
        
        # Generate all possible n-length tuples of (a,b) pairs
        from itertools import product
        for coeffs in product(product(coeff_range, repeat=2), repeat=n):
            polys = [Poly(a*x + b, x) for a, b in coeffs]
            if check_polynomials(polys):
                print(f"Found solution for n={n}:")
                for i, p in enumerate(polys):
                    print(f"  f_{i} = {p}")
                return n
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    min_n = find_min_n()
    if min_n is not None:
        print(f"\nThe minimal n is: {min_n}")
    else:
        print("No solution found in the search range")
```

The program searches for the minimal `n` by testing combinations of linear polynomials with small integer coefficients. It stops at the first valid solution found. The output shows each tested `n` and any found solutions. The minimal `n` is printed at the end if found within the search range.
