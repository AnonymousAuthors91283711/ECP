[write_program]
This problem involves finding real numbers x, y, z that satisfy two equations, with the conclusion that some function of them equals 1/2. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible solutions by testing small integer values for z (since denominators can't be zero) and solving for x and y.

The approach:
1. Iterate z values (avoiding 3 and 5 where denominators become zero)
2. For each z, solve the equations to find x and y
3. Print valid (x,y,z) triples that satisfy both equations
4. Verify if the omnimath1375_answer condition holds (though we don't know its definition)

```python
def solve_omnimath1375():
    # Iterate possible z values (avoiding 3 and 5)
    for z in range(-10, 11):
        if z == 3 or z == 5:
            continue
        
        # First equation: (x+4)/2 = (y+9)/(z-3)
        # Second equation: (y+9)/(z-3) = (x+5)/(z-5)
        # Let k = (y+9)/(z-3)
        
        # From first equation: x = 2k - 4
        # From second equation: y = k(z-3) - 9
        # Substitute into second equation: k = (2k-4+5)/(z-5)
        # => k(z-5) = 2k + 1
        # => kz - 5k = 2k + 1
        # => kz - 7k = 1
        # => k(z-7) = 1
        # => k = 1/(z-7) (when z !=7)
        
        if z == 7:
            continue  # would make k undefined
            
        k = 1 / (z - 7)
        x = 2 * k - 4
        y = k * (z - 3) - 9
        
        # Verify both original equations hold
        eq1 = (x + 4) / 2
        eq2 = (y + 9) / (z - 3)
        eq3 = (x + 5) / (z - 5)
        
        if abs(eq1 - eq2) < 1e-9 and abs(eq2 - eq3) < 1e-9:
            print(f"Solution found: x={x:.3f}, y={y:.3f}, z={z}")

solve_omnimath1375()
