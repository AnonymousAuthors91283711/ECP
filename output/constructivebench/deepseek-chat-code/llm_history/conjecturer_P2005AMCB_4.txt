theorem P2005AMCB_4 (totalQuizzes firstA : ℕ) 
  (h₁ : totalQuizzes = 50) (h₂ : firstA = 22) (h₃ : 30 ≤ totalQuizzes) :
  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | ∃ (remainingA : ℕ), 
    firstA + remainingA ≥ 4 * totalQuizzes / 5 ∧ 
    n = (totalQuizzes - 30) - remainingA} 
  (P2005AMCB_4_answer (totalQuizzes, firstA)) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found new maximum B: 2 (with remaining_A=18)

Final maximum number of B's: 2. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun (totalQuizzes, firstA) => totalQuizzes - 30 - (4 * totalQuizzes / 5 - firstA)>>>
