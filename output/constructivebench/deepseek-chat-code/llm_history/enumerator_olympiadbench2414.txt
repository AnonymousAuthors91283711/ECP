[write_program]
This problem asks for the sum of floor functions for (k+1)/3 where k ranges from 0 to 59. We'll compute this by enumerating each term and accumulating the sum.

The approach:
1. For each k from 0 to 59, compute (k+1)/3
2. Take the floor of each value
3. Sum all these floor values
4. Output the final sum

The program will compute this directly without any optimizations since the range is small (60 elements).

```python
def compute_sum():
    total = 0
    for k in range(60):
        term = (k + 1) // 3  # Equivalent to floor((k+1)/3)
        total += term
    print(total)

compute_sum()
```
