This problem involves calculating the number of elements in all four sets (diamond, golf, spade, candy) given the sizes of individual sets, pairs, and triples. The formula provided suggests using inclusion-exclusion principles. We'll verify this formula by enumerating possible values for the all_four variable and checking when the equation holds true.

```python
def main():
    total = 900
    diamond = 195
    golf = 367
    spade = 562
    candy = 900
    exactly_two = 437
    exactly_three = 234
    
    # The formula from the theorem
    # all_four = (diamond + golf + spade + candy - exactly_two - 2*exactly_three - total)/2
    # We'll compute the numerator first
    numerator = diamond + golf + spade + candy - exactly_two - 2 * exactly_three - total
    
    # Since all_four must be a non-negative integer, numerator must be even and non-negative
    if numerator % 2 == 0 and numerator >= 0:
        all_four = numerator // 2
        print(f"Possible solution found: {all_four}")
        print(f"Final answer: {all_four}")
    else:
        print("No valid solution exists with given parameters")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
