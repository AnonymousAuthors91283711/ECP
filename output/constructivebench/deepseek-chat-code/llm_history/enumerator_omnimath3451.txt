[write_program]
The problem appears to be calculating the sum of two values derived from dividing 100 by 1.25 and 0.8 respectively. We'll write a Python program to compute these values and their sum exactly, showing both the intermediate results and final sum.

```python
def exact_division(numerator, denominator):
    # Try to represent as exact fraction if denominator is a simple decimal
    if denominator == 1.25:
        return numerator * 4 / 5
    elif denominator == 0.8:
        return numerator * 5 / 4
    else:
        return numerator / denominator

m_last = exact_division(100, 1.25)
s_last = exact_division(100, 0.8)
sum_result = m_last + s_last

print(f"100/1.25 = {m_last}")
print(f"100/0.8 = {s_last}")
print(f"Sum = {sum_result}")
```
