This problem involves solving a system of two equations with two real variables x and y. The first equation is a circle equation (x² + y² = 6y - 4x + 12), and the second is a parabola equation (4y = x² + 4x + 12). We need to find all real solutions (x,y) that satisfy both equations.

The approach is to:
1. Solve the second equation for y in terms of x
2. Substitute this expression into the first equation
3. Solve the resulting equation for x
4. Find corresponding y values for each x solution

```python
import math

def solve_system():
    # We'll check x values in a reasonable range with small steps
    for x in range(-10, 11):
        x_val = x / 2.0  # Use finer granularity for better accuracy
        
        # Solve second equation for y
        y_val = (x_val**2 + 4*x_val + 12) / 4
        
        # Check if (x_val, y_val) satisfies first equation
        lhs = x_val**2 + y_val**2
        rhs = 6*y_val - 4*x_val + 12
        if math.isclose(lhs, rhs, abs_tol=1e-6):
            print(f"Solution found: ({x_val:.3f}, {y_val:.3f})")

    # Also check some non-integer x values that might be solutions
    for x in [-3.5, -2.5, -1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5]:
        x_val = x
        y_val = (x_val**2 + 4*x_val + 12) / 4
        lhs = x_val**2 + y_val**2
        rhs = 6*y_val - 4*x_val + 12
        if math.isclose(lhs, rhs, abs_tol=1e-6):
            print(f"Solution found: ({x_val:.3f}, {y_val:.3f})")
