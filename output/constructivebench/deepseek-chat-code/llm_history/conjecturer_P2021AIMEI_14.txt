Based on the problem statement and the condition that the sum of prime factors equals the number itself, this suggests the answer must be a square-free number where all prime factors are distinct. The smallest such number satisfying the divisibility condition is likely a product of the smallest primes that make 2021 divide the given expression. Since 2021 = 43 × 47, the minimal solution is probably their product.

<<<43 * 47>>>
