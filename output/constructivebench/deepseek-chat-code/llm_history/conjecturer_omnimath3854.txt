abbrev omnimath3854_answer : Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath3854 : omnimath3854_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking numbers up to 1000...
Found solution: n = 1

All solutions found:
1. Expected Answer Type: Prop
Based on the enumerated answer showing only n=1 as a solution and the expected type being Prop, this suggests the problem is likely about existence or uniqueness. The simplest proposition that matches this pattern is the existence of exactly one solution.
