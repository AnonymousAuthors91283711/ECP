[write_program]
This problem asks for all integers s â‰¥ 4 where there exist positive integers a,b,c,d such that s = a+b+c+d and s divides ab(c+d) + cd(a+b) (which simplifies the given condition). We'll write a Python program to find such s values by enumerating possible combinations.

The approach:
1. Iterate s from 4 upwards
2. For each s, try all possible combinations of a,b,c,d that sum to s
3. Check if s divides the expression ab(c+d) + cd(a+b)
4. Print s when found and continue searching

```python
def find_valid_s(max_s=30):
    found = set()
    for s in range(4, max_s + 1):
        # Try all possible a,b,c,d combinations that sum to s
        for a in range(1, s - 2):
            for b in range(1, s - a - 1):
                remaining = s - a - b
                for c in range(1, remaining):
                    d = remaining - c
                    if d <= 0:
                        continue
                    # Calculate ab(c+d) + cd(a+b)
                    numerator = a*b*(c+d) + c*d*(a+b)
                    if numerator % s == 0:
                        if s not in found:
                            print(f"Found s = {s}")
                            found.add(s)
                            break  # Move to next s once found
                else:
                    continue
                break
    print("Search completed up to s =", max_s)

find_valid_s()
```
