    (∀ f, P f ↔ f ∈ omnimath1582_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Potential solution found: f(x) = 1.0x + 0.0

Testing special case c = 0:
Solution with c=0: f(x) = 1.0x

Testing special case k = 1:
Solution with k=1: f(x) = x + 0.0

After testing, the only solution appears to be f(x) = x. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
<<<{f | ∃ c : ℝ, f = fun x => x + c}>>>
