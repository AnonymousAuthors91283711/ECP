The problem involves calculating the expected value of the number of times the last element appears in a random sequence of length 6 with elements from 1 to 6. We'll simulate this by enumerating all possible sequences and counting matches.

```python
from itertools import product

def main():
    total = 0
    count = 0
    # Enumerate all 6^6 possible sequences of length 6 with elements 1-6
    for seq in product(range(1, 7), repeat=6):
        last = seq[-1]
        matches = sum(1 for x in seq[:-1] if x == last)
        total += matches
        count += 1
        # Print partial results every 100000 sequences to show progress
        if count % 100000 == 0:
            print(f"After {count} sequences: average = {total/count:.6f}")
    
    # Final result
    print(f"Final average: {total/count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
