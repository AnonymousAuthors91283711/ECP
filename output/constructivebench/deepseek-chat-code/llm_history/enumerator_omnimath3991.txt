This problem involves solving a system of linear equations with rational coefficients to find the ratio (2*cake_price + 2*bagel_price)/cupcake_price. We'll enumerate possible rational solutions by parameterizing one variable and solving for the others.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve_system():
    # Parameterize cupcake_price as 1 to find ratio
    cupcake = Fraction(1, 1)
    
    # Solve first equation: cake + 2*cupcake + 3*b = 3*cake + b
    # Simplifies to: 2*cupcake + 2*b = 2*cake => cake = cupcake + b
    # Second equation: 3*cake + b = 6*cupcake
    # Substitute cake: 3*(cupcake + b) + b = 6*cupcake
    # 3*cupcake + 3*b + b = 6*cupcake => 4*b = 3*cupcake
    b = Fraction(3,4) * cupcake
    cake = cupcake + b
    
    # Calculate the answer: (2*cake + 2*b)/cupcake
    answer = (2 * cake + 2 * b) / cupcake
    
    print(f"cake_price: {cake}, cupcake_price: {cupcake}, bagel_price: {b}")
    print(f"Answer: {answer}")
