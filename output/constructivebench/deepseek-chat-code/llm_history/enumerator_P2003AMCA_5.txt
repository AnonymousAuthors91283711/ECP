This problem involves finding digits A, M, C (each between 0-9) such that when you form two numbers AMC10 and AMC12, their sum equals 123422, and then finding the sum A+M+C. We'll enumerate all possible digit combinations to find the solution.

```python
def solve():
    for A in range(1, 10):  # A can't be 0 since it's the first digit
        for M in range(0, 10):
            for C in range(0, 10):
                num1 = 10000*A + 1000*M + 100*C + 10
                num2 = 10000*A + 1000*M + 100*C + 12
                if num1 + num2 == 123422:
                    sum_amc = A + M + C
                    print(f"A={A}, M={M}, C={C}, sum={sum_amc}")
                    return  # Stop after finding first solution since problem implies uniqueness

solve()
```
