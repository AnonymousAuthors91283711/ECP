[write_program]
This problem involves finding the unique positive speed `v` of trains that satisfies certain conditions about their intervals and relative speed with respect to Linh. The key equation relates the passing interval to the train distance and relative speed.

We'll write a Python program to numerically approximate the solution by testing values of `v` in small increments until the equation is satisfied within a tolerance. The program will print candidate values that get progressively closer to the solution.

```python
def find_train_speed():
    # Constants from the problem
    train_interval = 3 / 60  # hours
    passing_interval = 10 / 60  # hours
    linh_speed = 60  # km/h
    tolerance = 1e-8
    
    # We know v must be greater than linh_speed (60 km/h)
    v = 60.1  # Starting value just above 60
    step = 0.0001  # Small step size for precision
    
    while True:
        relative_speed = v - linh_speed
        train_distance = v * train_interval
        calculated_interval = train_distance / relative_speed
        
        # Check if the equation is satisfied within tolerance
        if abs(calculated_interval - passing_interval) < tolerance:
            print(f"Found candidate solution: v = {v:.8f} km/h")
            return
        
        # Adjust v based on whether calculated interval is too large or small
        if calculated_interval > passing_interval:
            v += step
        else:
            v -= step
            step *= 0.1  # Reduce step size when we overshoot for finer precision
