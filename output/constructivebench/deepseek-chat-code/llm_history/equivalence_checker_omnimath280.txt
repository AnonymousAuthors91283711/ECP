Ground Truth Answer: fun n => choose (n - 1) 2
Proposed Answer: fun n => if n < 3 then 0 else (n * (n - 1)) / 2 - 1
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of ordered pairs (i,j) with i<j where π(i)*π(j) > i*j for some permutation π of {1,...,n}.

2. The ground truth answer is binomial(n-1, 2), which equals (n-1)(n-2)/2.

3. The proposed answer is:
   - 0 if n < 3
   - (n(n-1)/2) - 1 otherwise

Let's compare these:
- For n=1: both give 0
- For n=2: both give 0
- For n=3:
  - Ground truth: (2*1)/2 = 1
  - Proposed: (3*2)/2 -1 = 2
- For n=4:
  - Ground truth: (3*2)/2 = 3
  - Proposed: (4*3)/2 -1 = 5

The answers clearly diverge starting from n=3. The proposed answer grows quadratically but is consistently larger than the ground truth.
