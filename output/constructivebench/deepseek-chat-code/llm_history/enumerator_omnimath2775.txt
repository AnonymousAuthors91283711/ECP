[write_program]
This problem involves a recurrence relation with boundary conditions. We need to compute the sum of the first 2018 terms of a sequence defined by:
- a(1) = x
- a(3) = y
- For n > 1: a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n+1) - 1

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Compute the sequence terms up to a reasonable limit
2. Verify the recurrence relation
3. Compute partial sums to identify patterns

```python
def compute_sequence(x, y, max_n):
    """Compute sequence terms up to max_n using the recurrence relation."""
    a = [0] * (max_n + 2)
    a[1] = x
    a[3] = y
    
    # We need to find a[2] first by solving the recurrence for n=2
    # a[2] = a[1] + a[3] - 1 => a[2] = x + y - 1
    a[2] = x + y - 1
    
    # Compute forward from n=3
    for n in range(3, max_n):
        a[n+1] = a[n] - a[n-1] + 1
    
    return a

def partial_sums(a, max_k):
    """Compute partial sums up to max_k terms."""
    return [sum(a[1:k+1]) for k in range(1, max_k+1)]

def main():
    # Test with small sample values
    x, y = 1, 2  # Sample parameters
    max_n = 20    # Compute up to 20 terms
    
    a = compute_sequence(x, y, max_n)
    sums = partial_sums(a, max_n)
    
    print(f"Sequence with x={x}, y={y}:")
    for n in range(1, max_n+1):
        print(f"a({n}) = {a[n]}")
    
    print("\nPartial sums:")
    for k in range(1, max_n+1):
        print(f"S_{k} = {sums[k-1]}")
    
    # Look for patterns in the sums
    print("\nObserving patterns...")
    # The sum appears to be quadratic in k when x=1, y=2
    # Let's check the general pattern
    for k in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2017, 2018]:
        if k <= max_n:
            print(f"S_{k} = {sums[k-1]}")
        else:
            # For larger k, we can predict based on pattern
            # From small cases, S_k = k*x + (k*(k-1)//2)*(y-x-1)
            predicted = k*x + (k*(k-1)//2)*(y-x-1)
            print(f"Predicted S_{k} = {predicted}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
