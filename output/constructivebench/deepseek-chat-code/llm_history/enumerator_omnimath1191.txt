[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of 4 linear equations with 4 variables (x, y, z, w). The goal is to find the value of w that satisfies all equations. We'll write a Python program to solve this system symbolically using SymPy.

The approach is:
1. Define the system of equations
2. Solve the system symbolically
3. Extract and print the value of w

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def solve_system():
    x, y, z, w = symbols('x y z w')
    eq1 = Eq(2*x + y + z + w, 1)
    eq2 = Eq(x + 3*y + z + w, 2)
    eq3 = Eq(x + y + 4*z + w, 3)
    eq4 = Eq(x + y + z + 5*w, 25)
    
    solution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4), (x, y, z, w))
    print(f"w = {solution[w]}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_system()
```
