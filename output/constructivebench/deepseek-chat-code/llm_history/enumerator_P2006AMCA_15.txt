The problem asks for the infimum of all positive real numbers \( z \) such that there exists some \( x \) where \( \cos x = 0 \) and \( \cos(x + z) = \frac{1}{2} \). 

We can approach this by:
1. Finding all \( x \) where \( \cos x = 0 \) (which are \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi \) for integer \( k \))
2. For each such \( x \), solving \( \cos(x + z) = \frac{1}{2} \)
3. Finding the minimal positive \( z \) that satisfies this

The program will enumerate small integer values of \( k \) and compute the corresponding minimal positive \( z \) values, then find the smallest among them.

```python
import math

def find_min_z():
    min_z = float('inf')
    # Check k from -2 to 2 (sufficient to find minimal z)
    for k in range(-2, 3):
        x = math.pi/2 + k * math.pi
        # Solutions to cos(x + z) = 1/2
        # x + z = Â±pi/3 + 2nÏ€ or Â±5pi/3 + 2nÏ€ for integer n
        # We compute all possible z > 0 and find the minimal one
        for n in range(-1, 2):  # Check nearby periods
            for angle in [math.pi/3, -math.pi/3, 5*math.pi/3, -5*math.pi/3]:
                target = angle + 2 * n * math.pi
                z = target - x
                if z > 0 and z < min_z:
                    min_z = z
                    print(f"Found candidate: {z} (k={k}, n={n})")
    print(f"Minimal positive z: {min_z}")

find_min_z()
```
