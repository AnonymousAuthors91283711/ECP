theorem omnimath3681 (l : List ℕ) :

    ↔ l = omnimath3681_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No solution found. Expected Answer Type: List ℕ
Based on the problem constraints and the fact that no solution was found through enumeration, I conclude that there is no valid permutation of [1,2,...,9] that satisfies all the given conditions. The constraints are too restrictive for this set of numbers.
