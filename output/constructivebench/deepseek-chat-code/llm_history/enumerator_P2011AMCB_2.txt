This problem asks for the smallest natural number x such that when added to five given scores (90, 80, 70, 60, 85), the average of all six scores is at least 3 points higher than the average of the original five scores. We'll compute this by:

1. Calculating the original average of five scores
2. Determining the required six-score average (original average + 3)
3. Finding the minimal x that satisfies the inequality

```python
def main():
    scores = [90, 80, 70, 60, 85]
    sum5 = sum(scores)
    avg5 = sum5 / 5
    required_avg = avg5 + 3
    
    # The inequality: (sum5 + x)/6 >= required_avg
    # => sum5 + x >= 6*required_avg
    # => x >= 6*required_avg - sum5
    min_x = 6 * required_avg - sum5
    
    # Since x must be integer, take ceiling if not already integer
    x = int(min_x) if min_x == int(min_x) else int(min_x) + 1
    
    print(f"Original average: {avg5}")
    print(f"Required average: {required_avg}")
    print(f"Minimal x needed: {x}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
