theorem P2003AMCB_24 :
  IsLeast {c : ℕ | ∃ a b : ℕ, a < b ∧ b < c ∧ 
    ∃! (x : ℝ), x^2 + a^2 = 2^x + 2^a ∧ x^2 + b^2 = 2^x + 2^b ∧ x^2 + c^2 = 2^x + 2^c} 
  P2003AMCB_24_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No solution found for c up to 20. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the problem statement and the fact that no solution was found for c ≤ 20, we can deduce that the minimal c satisfying the conditions must be larger than 20. The problem involves finding a unique real solution x to a system of equations with natural numbers a < b < c. The smallest such c is likely 25, as it's the next perfect square after 16 and fits the pattern of the equations involving squares.

<<<25>>>
