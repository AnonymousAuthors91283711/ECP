The problem asks to count the number of pairs (m, n) where 1 ≤ m < n ≤ 30 and there exists a real x such that sin(mx) + sin(nx) = 2. Since the maximum value of sine is 1, the equation implies both sin(mx) and sin(nx) must equal 1 simultaneously.

We need to find all pairs (m, n) where m and n are positive integers with m < n ≤ 30, and there exists x such that mx ≡ π/2 mod 2π and nx ≡ π/2 mod 2π. This means (n-m)x must be divisible by 2π, and since x = (π/2 + 2πk)/m for some integer k, we can derive that n-m must be divisible by 4 when m is odd, or by 2 when m is even.

The Python program will enumerate all valid pairs (m, n) with m < n ≤ 30 that satisfy these conditions.

```python
def count_valid_pairs():
    count = 0
    for m in range(1, 31):
        for n in range(m + 1, 31):
            if (m % 2 == 1 and (n - m) % 4 == 0) or (m % 2 == 0 and (n - m) % 2 == 0):
                print(f"Found valid pair: ({m}, {n})")
                count += 1
    print(f"Total valid pairs: {count}")

count_valid_pairs()
```
