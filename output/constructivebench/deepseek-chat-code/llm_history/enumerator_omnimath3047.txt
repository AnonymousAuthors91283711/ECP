This problem involves calculating the total number of wins for Bingyi based on given match distributions and win percentages. We'll compute the exact values step by step.

```python
def calculate_bingyi_wins():
    total_games = 60
    games_per_pair = total_games // 3  # 20 games per pair
    
    # Wins in each pairing
    alvin_wins_ab = games_per_pair * 20 // 100  # 20% of AB games
    bingyi_wins_bc = games_per_pair * 60 // 100  # 60% of BC games
    cheska_wins_ca = games_per_pair * 40 // 100  # 40% of CA games
    
    # Calculate Bingyi's total wins:
    # 1. Wins against Alvin (remaining AB games)
    # 2. Wins against Cheska (BC games)
    # 3. Wins from Cheska's losses against Alvin (remaining CA games)
    bingyi_wins = (games_per_pair - alvin_wins_ab) + bingyi_wins_bc + (games_per_pair - cheska_wins_ca)
    
    print(f"Bingyi's total wins: {bingyi_wins}")

calculate_bingyi_wins()
```
