[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of equations to find the value of b given three equations:
a + b = 12
a + c = 17
b + c = 19

We'll write a Python program that:
1. Solves the system algebraically (though we could also enumerate possible values)
2. Prints the solution for b

The algebraic solution can be found by:
- Adding all three equations: 2a + 2b + 2c = 48 â†’ a + b + c = 24
- Subtracting each original equation from this sum to find individual variables

```python
# Solving the system:
# a + b = 12
# a + c = 17
# b + c = 19

# Calculate total sum
total = (12 + 17 + 19) // 2  # (a+b + a+c + b+c)/2 = a+b+c
a = total - 19  # a = (a+b+c) - (b+c)
b = total - 17  # b = (a+b+c) - (a+c)
c = total - 12  # c = (a+b+c) - (a+b)

print(f"Solution found: b = {b}")
```
