This problem involves finding a polynomial `p` that satisfies a functional equation and a specific value condition. The functional equation relates evaluations of `p` at different points, and we need to find all such polynomials that also satisfy `p(1) = 210`.

We'll approach this by:
1. Assuming `p` is a polynomial of degree `d`
2. Expanding the functional equation to find constraints on `p`
3. Using the value condition to determine coefficients
4. Enumerating possible degrees and checking for solutions

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.polynomial import Polynomial

def find_polynomial():
    # We'll try degrees up to 3 (higher degrees unlikely for this problem)
    for degree in range(4):
        print(f"Trying degree {degree} polynomial...")
        
        # Create general polynomial with unknown coefficients: p(x) = a0 + a1*x + ... + ad*x^d
        coeffs = [f'a{i}' for i in range(degree + 1)]
        p = Polynomial(coeffs)
        
        # Functional equation: (x + 10)*p(2x) = (8x - 32)*p(x + 6)
        # We'll evaluate at specific points to get equations
        
        # Choose x values that simplify the equation
        x_values = [-10, 4, 0, 1]  # x=-10 makes LHS zero, x=4 makes RHS zero, others for additional equations
        
        equations = []
        
        for x in x_values:
            lhs = (x + 10) * p(2*x)
            rhs = (8*x - 32) * p(x + 6)
            equations.append(lhs - rhs)  # equation = lhs - rhs = 0
        
        # Additional equation from p(1) = 210
        equations.append(p(1) - 210)
        
        # Now we have a system of equations to solve for coefficients
        # We'll print the equations to see the constraints
        print(f"Equations for degree {degree}:")
        for eq in equations:
            print(eq)
        
        # For actual solution, we'd need to solve this system symbolically
        # Here we'll just check if a quadratic solution works
        
        if degree == 2:
            # Try to find quadratic solution p(x) = a + b*x + c*x^2
            # Using x=0: 10*(a) = -32*(a + 6b + 36c) => 42a + 192b + 1152c = 0
            # Using x=1: 11*(a + 2b + 4c) = -24*(a + 7b + 49c) => 35a + 190b + 1220c = 0
            # p(1) = a + b + c = 210
            # Solving this system:
            A = np.array([
                [42, 192, 1152],
                [35, 190, 1220],
                [1, 1, 1]
            ])
            b = np.array([0, 0, 210])
            try:
                solution = np.linalg.solve(A, b)

                print(f"p(x) = {solution[0]} + {solution[1]}*x + {solution[2]}*x^2")
                # Verify the solution satisfies all equations
                return
            except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
