Solution pattern appears periodic with interval ~0.0000. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
Looking at the error messages, the main issue is that `π` needs to be properly qualified as `Real.pi` in Lean. The proposed solution pattern shows periodic solutions with intervals involving π, and the enumerated answers show solutions at specific angles plus multiples of π.

The function involves trigonometric identities, and we can see two types of solutions:
1. Solutions at π/4 + kπ/2 (from sin²x = cos²x)
2. Solutions involving arctan(√2) + kπ (from solving the equation)

Here's the corrected answer with proper Real.pi notation:

<<<{x : ℝ | ∃ k : ℤ, x = Real.pi/4 + k * Real.pi/2 ∨ x = Real.arctan (Real.sqrt 2) + k * Real.pi}>>>

Explanation:
1. The first part (π/4 + kπ/2) comes from setting sin²x = cos²x, which occurs at odd multiples of π/4
2. The second part (arctan(√2) + kπ) comes from solving the remaining equation after simplification
3. All solutions are periodic with period π (for arctan term) or π/2 (for π/4 term)
4. Used Real.pi instead of π and properly qualified all Real operations
