The problem asks to find all real triples (x, y, z) that satisfy three equations:
1. (x-1)(y-2) = 0
2. (x-3)(z+2) = 0
3. x + y*z = 9

We'll enumerate all possible cases based on the first two equations which are products equaling zero. Each factor in these products gives us separate cases to consider.

```python
def solve():
    # Case 1: x = 1 (from first equation)
    x = 1
    # Subcases from second equation when x=1:
    # 1a: x=3 (but x=1, so this is impossible)
    # 1b: z=-2
    z = -2
    # Plug into third equation: 1 + y*(-2) = 9 => -2y = 8 => y = -4
    print((1, -4, -2))

    # Case 2: y = 2 (from first equation)
    y = 2
    # Subcases from second equation when y=2:
    # 2a: x=3
    x = 3
    # Plug into third equation: 3 + 2*z = 9 => 2z = 6 => z = 3
    print((3, 2, 3))
    # 2b: z=-2
    z = -2
    # Plug into third equation: x + 2*(-2) = 9 => x -4 = 9 => x = 13
    print((13, 2, -2))
