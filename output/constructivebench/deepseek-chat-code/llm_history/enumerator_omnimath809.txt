This problem involves finding the value of f(2002) given a functional equation that relates f(a) + f(b) when a+b is a power of 2. We'll approach this by:

1. Understanding the functional equation: f(a) + f(b) = n² when a + b = 2ⁿ
2. Building up values of f recursively from known base cases
3. Finding a pattern or closed-form solution
4. Computing f(2002) based on this pattern

The program will compute f(k) for small values to identify the pattern, then use it to compute f(2002).

```python
def compute_f():
    # We'll store computed values of f in a dictionary
    f = {1: 0}  # Base case: f(1) must be 0 since 1+1=2=2^1 ⇒ f(1)+f(1)=1 ⇒ f(1)=0.5, but must be integer?
    # Wait, the problem says n>0 and a,b>0, but doesn't specify f(1)
    # Let's try to find a pattern
    
    # First, let's compute some small values
    max_n = 11  # Enough to cover 2002 (since 2^11=2048)
    
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        power = 2 ** n
        for a in range(1, power):
            b = power - a
            if a in f and b not in f:
                f[b] = n * n - f[a]
            elif b in f and a not in f:
                f[a] = n * n - f[b]
    
    # Now let's see if we can find a pattern for f(k)
    # Looking at the computed values, it seems f(k) = (number of 1s in binary representation of (k-1))
    # Let's verify this pattern
    
    def count_ones(x):
        return bin(x).count('1')
    
    # Check pattern for computed values
    pattern_holds = True
    for k in f:
        if f[k] != count_ones(k - 1):
            pattern_holds = False
            break
    
    if pattern_holds:
        print("Pattern verified: f(k) = number of 1s in binary of (k-1)")
        k = 2002
        result = bin(k - 1).count('1')
        print(f"f(2002) = {result}")
    else:
        print("Pattern not verified. Computed values:")
        for k in sorted(f):
            print(f"f({k}) = {f[k]}")

compute_f()
```
