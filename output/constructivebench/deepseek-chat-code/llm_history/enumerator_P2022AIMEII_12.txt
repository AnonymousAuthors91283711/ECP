This problem asks for the minimum value of s = a + b given constraints involving a, b, x, y and a unit circle condition. We'll approach it by:
1. Expressing a and b in terms of x and y using the given equations
2. Formulating s as a function of x and y
3. Searching for the minimum s where (x,y) lies within the unit circle

We'll implement a grid search over possible (x,y) points within the unit circle to approximate the minimum s.

```python
import math

def find_min_s():
    min_s = float('inf')
    best_xy = (0, 0)
    
    # Grid search parameters
    steps = 1000
    for i in range(-steps, steps + 1):
        x = i / steps
        max_y = math.sqrt(1 - x*x)
        for j in range(-steps, steps + 1):
            y = j / steps
            if x*x + y*y > 1:
                continue  # outside unit circle
            
            # Calculate a and b from constraints
            a = x + 4*y
            b = 5*x + y
            
            if a > 4 and b > 1:
                s = a + b
                if s < min_s:
                    min_s = s
                    best_xy = (x, y)
                    print(f"New minimum s={s:.6f} at (x,y)=({x:.4f},{y:.4f})")
    
    print(f"\nFinal minimum s: {min_s:.6f}")

find_min_s()
```
