[write_program]
This problem asks for the unique integer `a` such that 1 is a root of the polynomial X² + aX + 1, and then proves this value equals some `omnimath2917_answer`. We'll write a Python program to find this integer `a` by checking when substituting x=1 makes the polynomial evaluate to 0.

The polynomial condition is: 1² + a*1 + 1 = 0 → 1 + a + 1 = 0 → a = -2

Since this is straightforward algebra, we'll verify it computationally by checking the polynomial condition for integer values around -2.

```python
def find_a():
    # Check integers around the expected value
    for a in range(-5, 5):
        # Evaluate polynomial x^2 + a*x + 1 at x=1
        if 1**2 + a*1 + 1 == 0:
            print(f"Found solution: a = {a}")
            return
    print("No solution found in range")

find_a()
```
