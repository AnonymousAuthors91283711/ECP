[write_program]
This problem involves complex roots of unity and trigonometric identities. We'll write a Python program to compute the product of the given complex functions and find the angle α whose sine equals the imaginary part of the product.

The approach:
1. Compute the 727th root of unity ω = exp(2πi/727)
2. Define the function f(k) = 1 + ω^(3^(k-1)) + ω^(2*3^(k-1))
3. Compute the product of f(k) for k from 8 to 13 (inclusive)
4. Extract the imaginary part of the product
5. Find the angle α in [-π/2, π/2] whose sine equals this imaginary part

```python
import cmath
import math

def main():
    n = 727
    omega = cmath.exp(2j * math.pi / n)
    
    def f(k):
        exponent = 3 ** (k - 1) % n  # Using modulo to handle large exponents
        term1 = omega ** exponent
        term2 = omega ** (2 * exponent % n)
        return 1 + term1 + term2
    
    product = 1 + 0j
    for k in range(8, 14):  # k from 8 to 13 inclusive
        product *= f(k)
    
    imag_part = product.imag
    alpha = math.asin(imag_part)
    
    # Ensure alpha is in [-π/2, π/2]
    while alpha < -math.pi/2:
        alpha += math.pi
    while alpha > math.pi/2:
        alpha -= math.pi
    
    print(f"Imaginary part of product: {imag_part}")
    print(f"Angle α (radians): {alpha}")
    print(f"Angle α (degrees): {math.degrees(alpha)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
