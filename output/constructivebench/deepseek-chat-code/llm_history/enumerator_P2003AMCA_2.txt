The problem is to find the smallest positive integer n such that the equation 2*n*4 + 2*n*(4+5) = 2366 holds. We can simplify the equation algebraically first, then write a program to find the smallest n that satisfies it.

The equation simplifies to:
2*4*n + 2*9*n = 2366
8n + 18n = 2366
26n = 2366
n = 2366/26 = 91

But since we're asked to write a program to enumerate and verify, here's a Python solution that checks values of n until it finds the solution:

```python
# Find smallest positive integer n where 2*n*4 + 2*n*(4+5) == 2366
target = 2366
n = 1
while True:
    # Calculate left side of equation: 2*n*4 + 2*n*(4+5)
    total = 2 * n * 4 + 2 * n * (4 + 5)
    if total == target:
        print(f"Found solution: n = {n}")
        break
    elif total > target:
        print("No solution found")
        break
    n += 1
```

The program will quickly find that n=91 is the solution and print it. The loop terminates either when the solution is found or when the computed value exceeds the target (though in this case we know algebraically that a solution exists).
