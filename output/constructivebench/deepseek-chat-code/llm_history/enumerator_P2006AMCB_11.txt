This problem involves calculating the ratio of final cream amounts between two people (Joe and JoAnn) who start with the same amount of coffee, but have different drinking and adding patterns. We'll simulate their processes step by step to find the exact ratio.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def calculate_ratio():
    # Initial amounts
    joe_initial = Fraction(12, 1)
    joe_drink = Fraction(2, 1)
    joe_add = Fraction(2, 1)
    
    joann_initial = Fraction(12, 1)
    joann_add = Fraction(2, 1)
    joann_drink = Fraction(2, 1)
    
    # Joe's final cream is simply what he adds
    joe_final_cream = joe_add
    
    # JoAnn's final cream is more complex - it's the added cream multiplied by the remaining fraction
    joann_final_cream = joann_add * (joann_initial / (joann_initial + joann_add))
    
    # Calculate and print the exact ratio
    ratio = joe_final_cream / joann_final_cream
    print(f"Joe's final cream: {joe_final_cream}")
    print(f"JoAnn's final cream: {joann_final_cream}")
    print(f"Ratio (Joe/JoAnn): {ratio}")

    calculate_ratio()
