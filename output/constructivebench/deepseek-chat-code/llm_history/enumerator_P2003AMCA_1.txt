[write_program]
This problem involves calculating the difference between two sums. The first sum is the sum of even numbers (2*(k+1)) and the second sum is the sum of odd numbers (2*k+1). We'll write a Python program to compute this difference for various values of n and observe the pattern.

The program will:
1. Compute both sums for n from 1 to 20
2. Calculate their difference
3. Print the results to help identify the pattern

```python
def compute_difference(n):
    """Compute the difference between sum of first n even numbers and sum of first n odd numbers"""
    sum_even = sum(2*(k+1) for k in range(n))
    sum_odd = sum(2*k + 1 for k in range(n))
    return sum_even - sum_odd

# Compute and print results for n from 1 to 20
for n in range(1, 21):
    diff = compute_difference(n)
    print(f"n={n}: difference={diff}")

# After observing the pattern, we can conjecture the general formula
print("\nBased on the pattern, the difference appears to be n")
```
