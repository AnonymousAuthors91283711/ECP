    omnimath742_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2402
Proposed Answer: 2401
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n where √(n+99) - √n < 1.

2. To solve this, we can:
   - Start with the inequality: √(n+99) - √n < 1
   - Rearrange: √(n+99) < 1 + √n
   - Square both sides: n+99 < 1 + 2√n + n
   - Simplify: 98 < 2√n → 49 < √n → n > 2401

3. The smallest integer satisfying n > 2401 is 2402.

4. The proposed answer is 2401, but:
   - For n=2401: √(2401+99) - √2401 = √2500 - √2401 = 50 - 49 = 1, which is not less than 1
   - For n=2402: √(2402+99) - √2402 ≈ 50 - 49.02 ≈ 0.98 < 1

The ground truth answer (2402) is correct, while the proposed answer (2401) doesn't satisfy the inequality.

<<<False>>>
