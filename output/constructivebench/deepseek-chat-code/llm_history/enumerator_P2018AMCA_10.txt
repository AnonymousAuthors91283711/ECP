This problem asks for the cardinality of the solution set S defined by two linear equations in ℝ². The solution set is the intersection of two lines. We'll enumerate possible cardinalities (0, 1, or infinite) by checking different cases.

```python
def check_solutions():
    # Coefficients for the equations: x + y = 1 and x - y = 1
    a1, b1, c1 = 1, 1, 1  # x + y = 1
    a2, b2, c2 = 1, -1, 1  # x - y = 1
    
    # Calculate determinant to check if lines are parallel or coincident
    det = a1 * b2 - a2 * b1
    
    if det != 0:
        # Lines intersect at exactly one point
        print("Found solution with cardinality 1")
        print("Final answer: 1")
    else:
        # Check if lines are coincident (infinite solutions) or parallel (no solutions)
        if (a1/a2 == b1/b2 == c1/c2):
            print("Found solution with infinite cardinality")
        else:
            print("Found solution with cardinality 0")
            print("Final answer: 0")
