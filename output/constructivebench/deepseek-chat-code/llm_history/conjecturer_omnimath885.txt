<<<28>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks for the minimal sum of a 7-element set where each subset has an average that's an integer. The enumerated pattern suggests the minimal case is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} with sum 28. This satisfies all conditions since any subset's average will be rational with denominator dividing the subset size.
