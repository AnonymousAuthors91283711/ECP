[write_program]
This problem involves finding all triples (p, x, y) where p is prime and x ≠ y such that x⁴ - y⁴ = p(x³ - y³). We'll write a Python program to enumerate small integer solutions to help conjecture the pattern.

The approach:
1. Factor the equation as (x-y)(x³ + x²y + xy² + y³) = p(x-y)(x² + xy + y²)
2. Since x≠y, we can divide both sides by (x-y) to get x³ + x²y + xy² + y³ = p(x² + xy + y²)
3. We'll search for small integer solutions with x > y (without loss of generality)

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]:
        if n % p == 0:
            return n == p
    d = n - 1
    s = 0
    while d % 2 == 0:
        d //= 2
        s += 1
    for a in [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]:
        if a >= n:
            continue
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(s - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False
    return True

max_n = 50  # Search up to this value
print(f"Searching for solutions with x,y ≤ {max_n}")

for x in range(1, max_n + 1):
    for y in range(1, x):
        numerator = x**3 + x**2*y + x*y**2 + y**3
        denominator = x**2 + x*y + y**2
        if denominator == 0:
            continue
        p = numerator // denominator
        if numerator % denominator == 0 and is_prime(p):
            print(f"Found solution: p={p}, x={x}, y={y}")
            # Verify the original equation
            lhs = x**4 - y**4
            rhs = p * (x**3 - y**3)
            assert lhs == rhs, "Solution doesn't satisfy original equation"
```
