This problem asks for the probability that a random permutation of 6 elements has exactly one fixed point. We'll enumerate all possible permutations of 6 elements and count those with exactly one fixed point.

The approach:
1. Generate all permutations of 6 elements (6! = 720 total)
2. For each permutation, count how many elements are fixed points (Ïƒ(x) = x)
3. Count how many permutations have exactly one fixed point
4. Calculate the probability as (count from step 3) / 720

```python
from itertools import permutations

n = 6
elements = list(range(n))
total_permutations = 0
desired_count = 0

for perm in permutations(elements):
    fixed_points = sum(1 for i in range(n) if perm[i] == i)
    if fixed_points == 1:
        desired_count += 1
    total_permutations += 1

# Output the probability as a fraction
print(f"Found {desired_count} permutations with exactly one fixed point")
print(f"Total permutations: {total_permutations}")
print(f"Probability: {desired_count}/{total_permutations}")
```
