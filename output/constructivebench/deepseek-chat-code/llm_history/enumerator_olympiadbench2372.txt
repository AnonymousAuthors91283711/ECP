This problem involves a geometric sequence where we need to find how many terms (up to n=19) are integers. We'll solve the system of equations to find the initial term and common ratio, then enumerate the terms checking for integer values.

```python
def enumerate_geometric_sequence():
    # Solve the system of equations:
    # g0 + g1 = 40
    # g0 + g1 + g2 = 76 => g2 = 36
    # g0 + g1 + g2 + g3 = 130 => g3 = 54
    # From geometric sequence properties:
    # g1 = g0 * r
    # g2 = g1 * r = g0 * r^2 = 36
    # g3 = g2 * r = g0 * r^3 = 54
    
    # From g2/g3: r = 54/36 = 1.5
    r = 1.5
    
    # From g0 * r^2 = 36 => g0 = 36 / (1.5^2) = 16
    g0 = 16.0
    
    count = 0
    for n in range(20):
        term = g0 * (r ** n)
        if term.is_integer():
            print(f"n={n}: {int(term)}")
            count += 1
    
    print(f"Total integer terms found: {count}")
