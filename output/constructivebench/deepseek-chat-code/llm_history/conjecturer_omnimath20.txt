From the enumerated answers, we can observe that the maximum sum follows a linear pattern of 2n where n is the step value of f. The problem involves optimizing a sum under certain constraints, and the pattern suggests the optimal solution is achieved when f is a step function with value n up to some point. The maximum sum appears to be twice the step value of f.
