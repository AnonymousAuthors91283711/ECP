Ground Truth Answer: fun s => ∀ n, n ∈ s ↔ Even n
Proposed Answer: fun s => ∃ k, s = {n | n ≡ 0 [MOD k]} ∨ s = {n | n ≡ 0 [MOD k]}ᶜ
Let me analyze this carefully.

The ground truth states that the set s is exactly the set of all even numbers. The proposed answer suggests that s is either all multiples of some k or all non-multiples of some k.

1. For the ground truth (even numbers):
- It satisfies both conditions: sum of two evens is even, sum of two odds is even
- But it's a specific case where k=2 in the proposed answer

2. The proposed answer is more general:
- When k=2, it matches the ground truth
- But it allows for any k, not just k=2
- Also allows for the complement case (odd numbers when k=2)

The ground truth is a specific instance of the proposed answer (when k=2 and we take the multiples case). However, the proposed answer is more general and includes many other possibilities that don't match the ground truth (like k=3 or the complement cases).

Therefore, they are not equivalent. The proposed answer is too broad compared to the ground truth.
