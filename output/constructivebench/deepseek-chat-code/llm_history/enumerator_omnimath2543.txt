[write_program]
This problem involves computing the square of a product of sums of roots of the polynomial X^7 - 7. We'll write a Python program to:
1. Find all 7th roots of 7 (roots of X^7 - 7)
2. Compute the product K of all pairs (r_i + r_j) where i < j
3. Compute K^2

Since the roots are distinct, we'll use exact complex arithmetic via sympy for precise computation.

```python
import sympy as sp

def main():
    # Define the polynomial X^7 - 7
    x = sp.symbols('x')
    P = x**7 - 7
    
    # Find all 7 roots (using exact complex numbers)
    roots = sp.roots(P, multiple=True)
    
    # Compute product K of (r_i + r_j) for all i < j
    K = 1
    n = len(roots)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            K *= (roots[i] + roots[j])
    
    # Compute K^2
    K_squared = K**2
    
    # Print exact value and simplified form
    print("Exact value of K^2:")
    print(K_squared)
    print("\nSimplified form:")
    print(sp.simplify(K_squared))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
