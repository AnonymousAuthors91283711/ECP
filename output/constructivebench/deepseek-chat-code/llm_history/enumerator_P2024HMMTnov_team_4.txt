[write_program]
This problem asks for the sum of all digits in numbers that are multiples of 9 from 9 to 999 (since 9Ã—111=999). We'll write a Python program to calculate this sum by iterating through each multiple of 9 in that range and summing their digits.

The approach is:
1. Iterate through numbers from 9 to 999 in steps of 9
2. For each number, convert it to a string and sum its digits
3. Accumulate the total sum
4. Output the final result

```python
def sum_digits(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

total = 0
for n in range(9, 999 + 1, 9):
    total += sum_digits(n)
print(total)
```
