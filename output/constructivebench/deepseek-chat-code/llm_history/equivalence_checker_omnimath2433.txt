Ground Truth Answer: 72576000
Proposed Answer: Nat.factorial 10 * 9 * 8 / 12
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting the number of triples (i,j,k) in permutations of 10 elements where i < j < k and π(j) < π(k) < π(i).

2. The ground truth answer is 72,576,000.

3. The proposed answer is:
   Nat.factorial 10 * 9 * 8 / 12
   = 10! * 72 / 12
   = 3,628,800 * 6
   = 21,772,800

Now let's verify if this makes sense:
- For any permutation of 10 elements, there are C(10,3) = 120 possible triples (i,j,k)
- For each triple, there are 6 possible orderings of (π(i),π(j),π(k))
- Only 1 of these 6 orderings satisfies π(j) < π(k) < π(i)
- So total would be 10! * 120 / 6 = 10! * 20 = 72,576,000

The proposed answer gives a different value (21,772,800), so it's incorrect.
