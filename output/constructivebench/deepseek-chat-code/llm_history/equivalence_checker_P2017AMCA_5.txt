Ground Truth Answer: 245
Proposed Answer: 435
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting handshakes between two groups (huggers and handshakers) with constraints:
   - Total people: 30
   - Huggers: 20
   - Handshakers: 10
   - The groups are disjoint

2. The formula given calculates:
   - Handshakes among handshakers: (m*(m-1))/2 = (10*9)/2 = 45
   - Handshakes between handshakers and huggers: m*k = 10*20 = 200
   - Total handshakes: 45 + 200 = 245

3. The ground truth answer (245) matches this calculation.

4. The proposed answer (435) appears to be calculating something different - it's actually the combination C(30,2) = (30*29)/2 = 435, which would be the total possible handshakes without any constraints.

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the problem's constraints and calculations.
