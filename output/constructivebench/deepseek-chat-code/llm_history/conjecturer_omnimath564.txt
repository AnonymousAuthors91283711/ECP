abbrev omnimath564_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath564 :
  {n : ℕ | n > 1 ∧ ∃ m : ℤ, (n ^ 2 + 7 * n + 136) / (n - 1) = m ^ 2} = omnimath564_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for solutions up to n = 1000
Valid n values where (n²+7n+136)/(n-1) is perfect square:
n = 5, value = 49 = 7²
n = 37, value = 49 = 7². Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{5, 37, 136}>>>
