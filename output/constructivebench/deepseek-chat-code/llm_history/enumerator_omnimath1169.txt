[write_program]
This problem involves calculating a nested expectation of dice rolls. We'll compute it step by step for a standard 6-sided die (values 1-6). The calculation involves three nested expectations: Ea is the average of one die roll, Eb is Ea times the average of another die roll, and Ec is Eb times the average of a third die roll.

We'll compute this exactly using rational arithmetic to avoid floating-point approximations. The program will calculate each step explicitly and output the final result.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    # Possible die values (1-6)
    die_values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    n = len(die_values)
    
    # Calculate Ea = average of one die
    Ea = Fraction(sum(die_values), n)
    print(f"Ea = {Ea}")
    
    # Calculate Eb = Ea * average of another die
    Eb = Ea * Fraction(sum(die_values), n)
    print(f"Eb = {Eb}")
    
    # Calculate Ec = Eb * average of another die
    Ec = Eb * Fraction(sum(die_values), n)
    print(f"Ec = {Ec}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
