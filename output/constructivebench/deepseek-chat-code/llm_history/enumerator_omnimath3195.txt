This problem involves finding a natural number `c` between 5 and 10, and a natural number `k`, such that the equation `(c-1)*k + (k+1) = 100` holds. We need to find all possible pairs `(c,k)` that satisfy this equation, then determine the value of `k+1` that appears consistently across all valid solutions.

The approach is to:
1. Iterate through all possible values of `c` from 5 to 10
2. For each `c`, solve for `k` in the equation `(c-1)*k + (k+1) = 100`
3. Check if `k` is a natural number
4. Collect all valid `(c,k)` pairs
5. Verify that all solutions yield the same `k+1` value

```python
def find_solutions():
    solutions = []
    for c in range(5, 11):
        # Simplify equation: (c-1)*k + (k+1) = 100 => c*k - k + k + 1 = 100 => c*k = 99
        k = 99 / c
        if k.is_integer():
            k = int(k)
            solutions.append((c, k))
            print(f"Found solution: c={c}, k={k}, k+1={k+1}")
    
    # Verify all solutions have same k+1
    if solutions:
        k_plus_1_values = {k+1 for _, k in solutions}
        if len(k_plus_1_values) == 1:
            print(f"All solutions yield k+1 = {next(iter(k_plus_1_values))}")
        else:
            print("Warning: Inconsistent k+1 values across solutions")
    else:
        print("No solutions found")

find_solutions()
```
