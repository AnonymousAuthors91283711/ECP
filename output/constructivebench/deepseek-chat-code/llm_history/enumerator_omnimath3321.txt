[write_program]
This problem involves finding the smallest positive integer n such that an ant, starting at position 0, reaches or exceeds position 1 after n steps. In each step k, the ant moves forward by 1/(4 + k-1). We'll write a Python program to compute the ant's position after each step and find the smallest n where it reaches or exceeds 1.

```python
def find_min_steps():
    position = 0.0
    n = 1
    while True:
        step_size = 1.0 / (4 + (n - 1))
        new_position = position + step_size
        print(f"n={n}: position={new_position}")
        if new_position >= 1.0:
            print(f"Minimum steps needed: {n}")
            return
        position = new_position
        n += 1

find_min_steps()
```
