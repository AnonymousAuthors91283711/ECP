This problem involves finding complex numbers z and w satisfying certain conditions, particularly focusing on their imaginary parts expressed as sine functions with rational multiples of π. The goal is to find the minimal denominator n in the sine expression when m and n are coprime.

We'll approach this by:
1. Understanding the conditions z^13 = w and w^11 = z imply z^(143) = z
2. Considering non-zero solutions gives z^(142) = 1, so z is a 142nd root of unity
3. The imaginary part condition suggests we need to find primitive roots of unity
4. We'll enumerate possible denominators n that divide 142 (factors of 142 = 2 × 71)
5. For each n, we'll check coprime m values to find valid sine expressions

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def find_min_n():
    # Factors of 142 (since 142 = 2 * 71)
    possible_n = [1, 2, 71, 142]
    min_n = None
    
    for n in possible_n:
        # We need to find m coprime with n where m < n
        for m in range(1, n):
            if math.gcd(m, n) == 1:
                # Check if this (m,n) pair corresponds to a valid root
                # The exact verification would require complex arithmetic,
                # but we can proceed since all primitive roots will satisfy
                # the conditions when n divides 142
                if min_n is None or n < min_n:
                    min_n = n
                    print(f"Found candidate: m={m}, n={n}")
    
    if min_n is not None:
        print(f"\nMinimal denominator found: n = {min_n}")
    else:
        print("No solution found")

find_min_n()
```
