Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 3), (5, 8), (8, 13)}
Proposed Answer: {p : ℕ × ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, p = (k + 2, k + 3) ∧ k > 0}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a Fibonacci-like sequence F with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, and the standard Fibonacci recurrence relation.

2. We're looking for pairs (p₁, p₂) where both are positive integers and satisfy 5F(p₁) - 3F(p₂) = 1.

3. The ground truth gives specific solutions: (2,3), (5,8), (8,13).

4. The proposed answer suggests all pairs of the form (k+2, k+3) where k > 0.

Let's test the proposed answer against the ground truth:

- For k=0 (but k>0 is required, so skip)
- For k=1: (3,4) → Not in ground truth
- For k=2: (4,5) → Not in ground truth
- For k=3: (5,6) → Not in ground truth (ground truth has (5,8))
- For k=6: (8,9) → Not in ground truth (ground truth has (8,13))

The proposed answer generates many pairs that don't satisfy the original equation, and misses the specific structure of the Fibonacci sequence that makes only certain pairs work. The ground truth shows that the valid pairs follow a Fibonacci pattern (2,3), (5,8), (8,13) where both numbers are Fibonacci numbers with specific indices.
