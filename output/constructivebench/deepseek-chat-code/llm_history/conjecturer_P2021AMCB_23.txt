Looking at the enumerated triples and their probabilities, we can observe that for each arithmetic progression (a, b, c) where b-a = c-b, the probability is 2^(-a) * 2^(-b) * 2^(-c). The pattern suggests summing over all possible arithmetic progressions. The total probability appears to be 1/96 when we sum all these geometric series. The coprime pair representing 1/96 is (1,96).
