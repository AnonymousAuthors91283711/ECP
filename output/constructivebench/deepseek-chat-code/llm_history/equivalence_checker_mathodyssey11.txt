[check_equivalence] Problem: import Mathlib

open Set Function Real

noncomputable abbrev mathodyssey11_answer : ℕ → ℚ := sorry
theorem mathodyssey11 (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) :
  IsLeast {q : ℚ | ∃ (m : ℕ), 0 < m ∧ q = mathodyssey11_answer m} 13 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (Nat.card {y | ∃ x ∈ Set.Ico 0 (n : ℝ), y = ⌊x * ⌊x⌋⌋} + 90) / n
Proposed Answer: fun m : ℕ => 12 + m
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is asking to find a function mathodyssey11_answer that satisfies the given theorem about being the least element in a certain set.

2. The ground truth answer is a complex function involving cardinality of a set of floor functions, plus 90, divided by n.

3. The proposed answer is a simple linear function: 12 + m.

4. These are clearly not equivalent:
- The ground truth involves floor operations and set cardinality
- The proposed answer is a trivial linear function
- Their behaviors would be completely different for any input n
- The ground truth would produce fractional values (due to division by n), while the proposed answer gives integers
