[write_program]
This problem involves analyzing the limit of a sequence involving trigonometric functions and square roots. The sequence is defined as `n * r * sqrt(1 - cos(2π/n))` as `n` approaches infinity. We'll write a Python program to compute this sequence for increasing values of `n` to observe its behavior and conjecture the limit.

The approach will be:
1. Compute the sequence for increasing values of n
2. Use exact values where possible (like when n divides 2π cleanly)
3. Print the sequence values to observe convergence
4. Use small sample values of r (like r=1) to see the pattern

```python
import math

def compute_sequence(n, r=1):
    """Compute n*r*sqrt(1 - cos(2π/n))"""
    angle = 2 * math.pi / n
    cos_val = math.cos(angle)
    sqrt_term = math.sqrt(1 - cos_val)
    return n * r * sqrt_term

def main():
    r = 1  # Sample parameter
    print(f"Computing sequence with r = {r}")
    print("n\tvalue")
    
    # Start with small n and increase exponentially
    n_values = [2**k for k in range(1, 20)]
    for n in n_values:
        val = compute_sequence(n, r)
        print(f"{n}\t{val:.10f}")
    
    # Also check some non-power-of-2 values
    print("\nChecking some non-power-of-2 values:")
    for n in [3, 5, 10, 100, 1000, 10000]:
        val = compute_sequence(n, r)
        print(f"{n}\t{val:.10f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
