The problem involves finding four positive integers (a, b, c, d) such that the products {a*b, b*c, c*d, d*a} exactly match the set {64, 88, 120, 165}, and then determining the minimal sum of such quadruples. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible quadruples (a, b, c, d) that satisfy these conditions and find the minimal sum.

```python
def solve():
    S = {64, 88, 120, 165}
    min_sum = float('inf')
    found = False
    
    # Iterate through possible a values (factors of elements in S)
    possible_a = set()
    for x in S:
        for d in range(1, x+1):
            if x % d == 0:
                possible_a.add(d)
    
    for a in sorted(possible_a):
        # Find possible b values where a*b is in S
        possible_b = set()
        for x in S:
            if x % a == 0:
                possible_b.add(x // a)
        
        for b in possible_b:
            # Find possible c values where b*c is in S
            possible_c = set()
            for x in S:
                if x % b == 0:
                    possible_c.add(x // b)
            
            for c in possible_c:
                # Find d where c*d is in S and d*a is in S
                possible_d = set()
                for x in S:
                    if x % c == 0:
                        possible_d.add(x // c)
                
                for d in possible_d:
                    products = {a*b, b*c, c*d, d*a}
                    if products == S:
                        current_sum = a + b + c + d
                        print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, sum={current_sum}")
                        if current_sum < min_sum:
                            min_sum = current_sum
                        found = True
    
    if found:
        print(f"Minimal sum found: {min_sum}")
    else:
        print("No solutions found")

solve()
```
