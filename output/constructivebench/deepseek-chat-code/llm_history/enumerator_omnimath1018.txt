[write_program]
This problem is about finding natural numbers n > 0 where there does NOT exist a gap of n consecutive composite numbers below n!. We'll write a Python program to search for such numbers n by checking for prime-free intervals of length n below n!.

The approach:
1. For each n from 1 upwards, compute n!
2. Check all possible intervals [k+1, k+n] below n! to see if any is prime-free
3. If no such interval exists, output n as a candidate

```python
import math
from sympy import isprime

def check_n(n):
    """Check if there's a prime-free interval of length n below n!"""
    factorial = math.factorial(n)
    # We only need to check up to n! - n since k+n must be <= n!
    for k in range(1, factorial - n + 1):
        all_composite = True
        for m in range(k + 1, k + n + 1):
            if isprime(m):
                all_composite = False
                break
        if all_composite:
            return False  # Found a prime-free interval
    return True  # No prime-free interval found

max_n = 10  # Reasonable upper bound for demonstration
print("Checking n where no prime-free interval of length n exists below n!:")
for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    if check_n(n):
        print(f"Found candidate: {n}")
```
