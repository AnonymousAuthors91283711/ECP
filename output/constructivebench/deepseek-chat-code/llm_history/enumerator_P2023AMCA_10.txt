This problem involves finding real numbers x and y that satisfy two equations with constraints x>0 and y>0. We'll solve it by:
1. Expressing x in terms of y from the first equation (y³ = x²)
2. Substituting into the second equation ((y-x)² = 4y²)
3. Solving for y, then finding corresponding x
4. Calculating x + y for valid solutions

We'll implement this step-by-step in Python, using exact rational arithmetic where possible to avoid floating-point inaccuracies.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from math import isqrt

def solve_problem():
    # We'll search for rational solutions first
    max_denominator = 100  # Reasonable limit for exact solutions
    
    # Iterate possible denominators for y
    for den in range(1, max_denominator + 1):
        # Iterate possible numerators for y (y must be positive)
        for num in range(1, 10 * den + 1):
            y = Fraction(num, den)
            
            # From y³ = x², x = y^(3/2)
            # For x to be rational, y must be a perfect square divided by a perfect square
            # Let y = (a/b)^2 where a,b are integers
            # Then x = (a/b)^3
            
            # Find a,b such that y = (a/b)^2
            a_squared = num * den
            b_squared = den * den
            a = isqrt(a_squared)
            if a * a != a_squared:
                continue  # y is not a perfect square of a rational
                
            x = Fraction(a * a * a, b_squared * den)
            
            # Check second equation: (y - x)^2 = 4*y^2
            lhs = (y - x) ** 2
            rhs = 4 * y * y
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"Exact solution: x = {x}, y = {y}, x + y = {x + y}")
                return  # We found the solution, can stop
    
    print("No exact rational solution found within search bounds")
