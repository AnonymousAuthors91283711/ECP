Based on the problem statement, we need to find a complex number s = (a + b)² where a and b are roots of P(P(z)) along with 3 and 4, for some quadratic polynomial P with leading coefficient 1.

Key observations:
1. P is quadratic with leading coefficient 1, so P(z) = z² + pz + q
2. P(P(z)) has roots 3,4,a,b
3. The sum of roots of P(P(z)) can be related to coefficients of P

The error in the proposed answer comes from using `sqrt` directly - in Lean we need to use `Real.sqrt` and cast it to ℂ. Also, the answer needs to be marked noncomputable.

Looking at the structure, the correct answer should be a complex number representing (a+b)² where a,b are the additional roots. The most plausible answer based on polynomial relationships is 49/4 (which is (7/2)²), but since we need a complex answer, I'll provide the proper Lean syntax.

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2020AIMEI_14_answer : ℂ := (7 : ℂ) / 2>>>

Explanation:
The sum of roots of P(P(z)) is 3 + 4 + a + b. For a quadratic P(z) = z² + pz + q, P(P(z)) is a quartic whose sum of roots is -2p. This gives 7 + a + b = -2p. Meanwhile, P(3) + P(4) = 0 gives another equation. Solving these leads to a + b = 7/2, so (a+b)² = 49/4. The answer is thus 7/2 as a complex number.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the problem statement, we need to find a complex number (a + b)^2 where a and b are roots of P(P(z)) along with 3 and 4, for some quadratic polynomial P with leading coefficient 1.

Key observations:
1. P is quadratic with leading coefficient 1, so P(z) = (z - r)(z - s) for some roots r, s
2. P(P(z)) has roots 3,4,a,b, meaning P(3) = 0 or P(4) = 0 (since P(P(z)) = 0 implies P(z) is a root of P)
3. The most symmetric case would be P(3) = P(4) = 0, making P(z) = (z-3)(z-4)
4. Then P(P(z)) = (P(z)-3)(P(z)-4), whose roots come from P(z)=3 and P(z)=4
5. Solving (z-3)(z-4)=3 and (z-3)(z-4)=4 gives the other roots (7±√13)/2 and (7±√17)/2
6. The sum a+b would be (7+√13)/2 + (7-√13)/2 = 7, so (a+b)^2 = 49

The error in the original answer was having duplicate declarations and incorrect syntax. Here's the corrected version:

<<<(49 : ℂ)>>>

Explanation: The problem reduces to finding roots of P(P(z)) where P is quadratic. The most natural solution comes from P(z) = (z-3)(z-4), leading to other roots whose sum squared is 49. The original answer of 7/2 was incorrect - it appears to have been a miscalculation of the sum rather than the square of the sum.
