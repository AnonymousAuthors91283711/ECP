For n = 2:
Maximum cardinality appears to be ℵ₀ (countable infinity)
This is because:
- The set of all n-th power free numbers is infinite
- Any infinite subset must be countable
- No larger cardinality exists for subsets of ℕ

For n = 3:
Maximum cardinality appears to be ℵ₀ (countable infinity)
This is because:
- The set of all n-th power free numbers is infinite
- Any infinite subset must be countable
- No larger cardinality exists for subsets of ℕ

For n = 4:
Maximum cardinality appears to be ℵ₀ (countable infinity)
This is because:
- The set of all n-th power free numbers is infinite
- Any infinite subset must be countable
- No larger cardinality exists for subsets of ℕ

For n = 5:
Maximum cardinality appears to be ℵ₀ (countable infinity)
This is because:
- The set of all n-th power free numbers is infinite
- Any infinite subset must be countable
- No larger cardinality exists for subsets of ℕ. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
