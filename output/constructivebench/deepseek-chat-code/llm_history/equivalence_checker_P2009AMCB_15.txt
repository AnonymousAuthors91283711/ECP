theorem P2009AMCB_15 (r : ℝ) (hr : 0 < r ∧ r < 3) :
  IsGreatest {x : ℝ | 
    x = (log (7/3)) / (log (1 + r)) ∨
    x = (log (7/3)) / (log (1 + r/10)) ∨
    x = (log (7/3)) / (log (1 + 2*r)) ∨
    x = (log (7/3)) / (log (1 + sqrt r)) ∨
    x = (log (7/3)) / (log (1 + 1/r))}
  (P2009AMCB_15_answer r) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun r => (log (7/3)) / (log (1 + r/10))
Proposed Answer: fun r => (log (7/3)) / (log (1 + r/10))
