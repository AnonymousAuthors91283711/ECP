[write_program]
The problem asks to simplify the expression `((x - y)^2 - (y - x)^2)^2` and find what it equals to. We can observe that `(x - y)` and `(y - x)` are negatives of each other, so their squares will be equal. Therefore, the expression inside the parentheses will be zero, making the entire expression zero.

To verify this, we'll write a Python program that:
1. Takes sample values for x and y
2. Computes the expression for these values
3. Prints the results to confirm they're always zero

```python
def compute_expression(x, y):
    term1 = (x - y)**2
    term2 = (y - x)**2
    return (term1 - term2)**2

# Test with various sample values
test_values = [
    (0, 0),
    (1, 0),
    (0, 1),
    (1, 1),
    (2, 3),
    (-1, 1),
    (1.5, 2.5),
    (100, -100)
]

for x, y in test_values:
    result = compute_expression(x, y)
    print(f"For x={x}, y={y}: result={result}")
```
