This problem asks for the number of positive integer pairs (a, b) with a ≤ b such that 1/a + 1/b = 1/6. We'll enumerate all possible pairs by solving the equation algebraically and checking integer solutions.

The approach:
1. Rewrite the equation as 6b + 6a = ab
2. Rearrange to ab - 6a - 6b = 0
3. Add 36 to both sides: ab - 6a - 6b + 36 = 36
4. Factor as (a-6)(b-6) = 36
5. Find all factor pairs of 36 where a-6 and b-6 are positive integers (since a,b > 0)
6. Count unique pairs with a ≤ b

```python
def find_pairs():
    target = 36
    pairs = set()
    # Iterate through all factor pairs of 36
    for d in range(1, int(target**0.5) + 1):
        if target % d == 0:
            # Get both factor pairs (d, target//d) and (target//d, d)
            for a_minus_6, b_minus_6 in [(d, target//d), (target//d, d)]:
                a = a_minus_6 + 6
                b = b_minus_6 + 6
                if a <= b:
                    pairs.add((a, b))
    # Print all valid pairs
    for pair in sorted(pairs):
        print(pair)
    # Print the count
    print(f"Total pairs: {len(pairs)}")

find_pairs()
