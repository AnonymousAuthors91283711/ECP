Ground Truth Answer: fun T => (T - 13) * (30 - 16) / (20 - 13) + 16
Proposed Answer: fun T => 2 * T - 6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes an arithmetic sequence where:
   - aₙ = a₁ + (n-1)d
   - a₁₆ = 13
   - a₃₀ = 20

2. The ground truth answer correctly solves for n in terms of T:
   - Using the arithmetic sequence formula and given values, we get:
     n = (T - 13)*(30-16)/(20-13) + 16
   - Simplified: n = (T-13)*14/7 + 16 = 2(T-13) + 16 = 2T - 26 + 16 = 2T - 10

3. The proposed answer is: 2T - 6

4. Comparing the correct simplified form (2T - 10) with the proposed answer (2T - 6), we see they differ by a constant (+4).

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the given conditions (a₁₆ = 13 and a₃₀ = 20). For example:
- For T=13 (a₁₆), ground truth gives n=16, but proposed gives n=20
- For T=20 (a₃₀), ground truth gives n=30, but proposed gives n=34

<<<False>>>
