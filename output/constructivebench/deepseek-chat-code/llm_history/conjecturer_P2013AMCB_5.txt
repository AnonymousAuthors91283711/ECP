The error occurs because Lean requires explicit marking of noncomputable operations when working with real numbers (ℝ). The division operation on reals is noncomputable in Lean's standard library. We need to either:
1. Mark the definition as noncomputable, or
2. Use rational numbers (ℚ) instead if exact fractions are sufficient

Since the problem expects a real number result and the exact fraction is 99/4, we'll use the first approach. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2013AMCB_5_answer : ℝ := 99/4>>>

Explanation:
1. The calculation (33*11 + 55*33)/(33 + 55) simplifies to (363 + 1815)/88 = 2178/88 = 99/4
2. We add the 'noncomputable' modifier because real number division isn't computable in Lean's standard library
3. The result is kept as exact fraction 99/4 which will be interpreted as a real number
4. This matches both the exact fraction and decimal value from the enumerated answers[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error occurs because Lean requires explicit marking of noncomputable operations when working with real numbers (ℝ). The division operation on reals is noncomputable in Lean's type system. We need to either:
1. Mark the definition as noncomputable, or
2. Use rational numbers (ℚ) instead if exact fractions are sufficient

Since the problem specifically asks for a real number answer and shows the exact fraction 99/4, we'll use the first approach and mark it as noncomputable.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2013AMCB_5_answer : ℝ := 99/4>>>

Explanation:
1. The calculation (33*11 + 55*33)/(33 + 55) simplifies to (363 + 1815)/88 = 2178/88 = 99/4
2. The exact value is indeed 99/4 (24.75 in decimal)
3. We add the 'noncomputable' modifier because real number division in Lean is noncomputable by default
4. The type is kept as ℝ to match the theorem statement[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
