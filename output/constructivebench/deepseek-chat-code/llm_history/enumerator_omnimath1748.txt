[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest base `b > 1` such that `1 + b + b² + b³` is a perfect square. We'll write a Python program to search for such bases and identify the minimal one.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible base values `b` starting from 2 upwards
2. For each `b`, compute the value `1 + b + b² + b³`
3. Check if this value is a perfect square
4. Print any valid bases found
5. After searching up to a reasonable limit, output the smallest found base

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    root = math.isqrt(n)
    return root * root == n

max_b = 100  # Reasonable search limit
found_bases = []

for b in range(2, max_b + 1):
    value = 1 + b + b**2 + b**3
    if is_perfect_square(value):
        found_bases.append(b)
        print(f"Found base: {b} (value = {value} = {math.isqrt(value)}^2)")

if found_bases:
    print(f"Smallest base found: {min(found_bases)}")
else:
    print(f"No bases found up to b = {max_b}")
```
