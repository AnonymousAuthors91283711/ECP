This problem asks for the largest subset of numbers from 1 to 30 where no two distinct numbers sum to a multiple of 5. We'll approach this by:

1. Analyzing numbers modulo 5 since the condition involves divisibility by 5
2. Considering that pairs (1,4) and (2,3) sum to 5 (mod 5)
3. The optimal strategy is to take numbers from only one residue class (0 mod 5) plus at most one from each of the complementary pairs (1/4 and 2/3)

Here's the Python program to find the maximum subset size:

```python
def max_subset_no_sum_mod5():
    numbers = list(range(1, 31))
    max_size = 0
    best_subset = set()
    
    # Group numbers by their residue mod 5
    residues = {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: []}
    for n in numbers:
        residues[n % 5].append(n)
    
    # Strategy 1: Take all numbers â‰¡0 mod5 plus max from 1/4 and 2/3
    size0 = len(residues[0])
    size1 = max(len(residues[1]), len(residues[4]))
    size2 = max(len(residues[2]), len(residues[3]))
    total1 = size0 + size1 + size2
    
    # Strategy 2: Take largest single residue class
    max_single = max(len(v) for v in residues.values())
    
    max_size = max(total1, max_single)
    print(f"Maximum subset size: {max_size}")

max_subset_no_sum_mod5()
```
