[write_program]
This problem is about finding the minimum number of guesses needed to uniquely identify a secret binary string of length `n`, given that any guess differs from the secret in exactly `k` positions. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values for small `n` and `k` to help conjecture the general formula.

The approach:
1. For small values of `n` and `k` (with `k < n`), we'll generate all possible binary strings of length `n`
2. For each possible set of guesses, we'll check if it satisfies the uniqueness condition
3. We'll find the minimal size of such guess sets

```python
from itertools import combinations, product

def solve(n, k):
    # Generate all possible binary strings of length n
    all_strings = list(product([0,1], repeat=n))
    
    # Try increasing guess set sizes until we find one that works
    for m in range(1, 2**n + 1):
        # Try all possible combinations of m guesses
        for guesses in combinations(all_strings, m):
            valid = True
            for s in all_strings:
                # Check if s is uniquely determined by the guesses
                possible = []
                for t in all_strings:
                    match = True
                    for u in guesses:
                        if sum(a != b for a, b in zip(u, t)) != k:
                            match = False
                            break
                    if match:
                        possible.append(t)
                if len(possible) != 1 or possible[0] != s:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                print(f"For n={n}, k={k}, found solution with m={m}")
                return m
    return None

# Test small cases
for n in range(2, 6):
    for k in range(1, n):
        solve(n, k)
```

Note: This brute-force approach will only work for very small values of `n` (up to about 4) due to combinatorial explosion. For larger values, we'd need a more sophisticated approach or mathematical insight. The output will show the minimal `m` for each tested pair (n,k), helping to identify patterns that might lead to a general formula.
