Total count: 94. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the enumerated answers, we notice that all numbers from 1 to 100 are present except for:
- 16 (4^2)
- 32 (2^5)
- 48 (16*3)
- 81 (9^2)
- 96 (32*3)

These missing numbers are either perfect squares or have prime factors with exponents that make them incompatible with being gcd(a²,b³). The total count is 100 - 6 = 94.
