This problem involves analyzing a repeating traffic light pattern and calculating the time difference between certain red lights. The pattern repeats every 5 seconds with red lights at positions 0 and 1 (0-based). We need to find the difference between the 21st and 3rd red light occurrences, then perform a calculation.

The Python program will:
1. Generate the repeating pattern [0,0,1,1,1] where 0 represents red
2. Simulate the traffic light sequence until we find at least 21 red lights
3. Calculate the positions of the 3rd and 21st red lights
4. Compute the required expression ((21st - 3rd)*6)/12

```python
def solve():
    pattern = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  # 0 means red light
    red_positions = []
    time = 0
    
    # Collect positions of red lights until we have at least 21
    while len(red_positions) < 21:
        if pattern[time % 5] == 0:
            red_positions.append(time)
        time += 1
    
    third_red = red_positions[2]
    twenty_first_red = red_positions[20]
    result = ((twenty_first_red - third_red) * 6) / 12
    
    print(f"3rd red at: {third_red}")
    print(f"21st red at: {twenty_first_red}")
    print(f"Result: {result}")

solve()
```
