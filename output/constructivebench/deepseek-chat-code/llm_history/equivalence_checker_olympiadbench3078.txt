Ground Truth Answer: 15/4
Proposed Answer: 9/4 + 3/2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem is asking for the greatest value of s = x + y under the constraints:
   - y = x² (a parabola)
   - y - x = 3 - y (which simplifies to 2y - x - 3 = 0)

2. Substituting y = x² into the second equation gives:
   2x² - x - 3 = 0
   Solving this quadratic equation:
   x = [1 ± √(1 + 24)]/4 = [1 ± 5]/4
   So x = 3/2 or x = -1

3. For x = 3/2:
   y = (3/2)² = 9/4
   s = x + y = 3/2 + 9/4 = 15/4

4. For x = -1:
   y = (-1)² = 1
   s = x + y = -1 + 1 = 0

5. The greatest value is clearly 15/4 (ground truth answer)

6. The proposed answer is 9/4 + 3/2 which equals:
   9/4 + 6/4 = 15/4

The two answers are mathematically equivalent, just written in different forms.
