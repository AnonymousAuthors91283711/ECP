This problem involves finding the minimum value of the expression \(x^7(yz-1) + y^7(zx-1) + z^7(xy-1)\) under the constraints \(x,y,z > 0\) and \(x+y+z = xyz\). The solution likely occurs when \(x=y=z\), so we'll first test this symmetric case.

We'll:
1. Solve for \(x\) when \(x=y=z\) under the constraint \(3x = x^3\)
2. Compute the expression's value at this symmetric point
3. Check nearby points to verify if this is indeed the minimum

```python
import math

def compute_expression(x, y, z):
    return x**7 * (y*z - 1) + y**7 * (z*x - 1) + z**7 * (x*y - 1)

# Symmetric case x=y=z
x_sym = math.sqrt(3)
value_sym = compute_expression(x_sym, x_sym, x_sym)
print(f"Symmetric case x=y=z=âˆš3: {value_sym}")

# Check nearby points
delta = 0.1
for dx in [-delta, 0, delta]:
    for dy in [-delta, 0, delta]:
        x = x_sym + dx
        y = x_sym + dy
        # Solve for z from x+y+z=xyz
        if x*y == 1:
            continue  # Avoid division by zero
        z = (x + y) / (x * y - 1)
        if z > 0:
            val = compute_expression(x, y, z)
            print(f"x={x:.3f}, y={y:.3f}, z={z:.3f}: {val}")

# The symmetric case appears to give the minimal value
print("Minimum value found:", value_sym)
```
