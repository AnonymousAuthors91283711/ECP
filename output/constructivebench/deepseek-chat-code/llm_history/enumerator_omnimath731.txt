[write_program]
This problem asks for the largest possible number of distinct remainders modulo 210 in an infinite sequence of natural numbers where each term divides the next. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible sequences and count distinct remainders.

The key observations:
1. The sequence must be eventually constant modulo 210 since divisibility chains stabilize modulo any number
2. The distinct remainders must form a divisibility chain themselves modulo 210
3. We need to find the longest possible chain of divisors in the ring Z/210Z

```python
import math
from itertools import combinations

def divisors(n):
    """Return all divisors of n"""
    divs = {1}
    for p, e in factor(n).items():
        divs.update([d*p**k for k in range(1,e+1) for d in divs.copy()])
    return sorted(divs)

def factor(n):
    """Return prime factorization of n as dict"""
    factors = {}
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors[2] = factors.get(2, 0) + 1
        n = n // 2
    i = 3
    while i*i <= n:
        while n % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            n = n // i
        i += 2
    if n > 1:
        factors[n] = 1
    return factors

def count_max_distinct_remainders():
    """Find maximum number of distinct remainders mod 210 in divisibility sequence"""
    m = 210
    # Find all divisors of 210 (since remainders must divide each other)
    divs = divisors(m)
    max_len = 0
    best_chain = []
    
    # Try all possible chains of divisors
    for r in range(1, len(divs)+1):
        for chain in combinations(divs, r):
            # Check if each element divides the next
            valid = True
            for i in range(len(chain)-1):
                if chain[i+1] % chain[i] != 0:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid and len(chain) > max_len:
                max_len = len(chain)
                best_chain = chain
                print(f"New max: {max_len}, chain: {best_chain}")
    
    print(f"Final maximum number of distinct remainders: {max_len}")
    return max_len
