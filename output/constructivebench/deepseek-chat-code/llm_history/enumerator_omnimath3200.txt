[write_program]
This problem is a simple linear equation where we need to find the integer `n` that satisfies the equation `5*(n-2) = 85`. The solution can be found by solving for `n` algebraically. We'll write a Python program that verifies the solution by checking possible integer values around the expected solution.

```python
def solve_equation():
    # The equation is 5*(n-2) = 85
    # Let's solve it algebraically first: n-2 = 17 => n = 19
    # We'll verify this by checking integers around 19
    target = 85
    for n in range(15, 25):  # Check a reasonable range around the expected solution
        if 5 * (n - 2) == target:
            print(f"Solution found: n = {n}")
            return
    print("No solution found in the tested range")
