Based on the problem statement and the fact that no valid m was found in the enumerated range, the function f appears to be counting single-digit divisors of n. The recurrence relation suggests a linear recurrence, but since no finite m satisfies the condition, the minimal such m must be unbounded. Therefore, the answer is likely that no such finite m exists, which we represent as 0 in ℕ since it's the minimal natural number.
