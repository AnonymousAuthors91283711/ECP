[write_program]
This problem asks for the maximum number of disjoint triples (3-element subsets) of numbers from 1 to 100 where each triple satisfies the condition that the product of two elements equals the third element. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible configurations and find this maximum.

The approach:
1. Generate all valid triples (a,b,c) where a*b = c and a,b,c are distinct numbers in 1..100
2. Find the maximum number of disjoint triples that can be selected from these valid triples

```python
from itertools import combinations

def find_max_disjoint_triples():
    # First generate all valid triples (a,b,c) where a*b = c and a,b,c distinct in 1..100
    valid_triples = set()
    for a in range(1, 101):
        for b in range(a + 1, 101):
            c = a * b
            if c <= 100 and c != a and c != b:
                # Store as frozenset to handle unordered triples
                valid_triples.add(frozenset({a, b, c}))
    
    # Convert to list of sets for easier processing
    triples = [set(t) for t in valid_triples]
    n = len(triples)
    
    max_count = 0
    best_solution = []
    
    # We'll use a greedy approach to find a maximal disjoint set
    # This won't guarantee maximum, but will give a lower bound
    used_numbers = set()
    solution = []
    
    for t in sorted(triples, key=lambda x: min(x)):
        if used_numbers.isdisjoint(t):
            solution.append(t)
            used_numbers.update(t)
    
    print(f"Found {len(solution)} disjoint triples in greedy solution:")
    for t in solution:
        print(sorted(t))
    
    # Now try to find larger solutions by brute force for small cases
    # This is only feasible for very small numbers of triples
    if n <= 20:
        print("\nTrying exhaustive search...")
        from itertools import combinations
        for k in range(min(10, n), 0, -1):
            for candidate in combinations(triples, k):
                all_disjoint = True
                seen = set()
                for t in candidate:
                    if not seen.isdisjoint(t):
                        all_disjoint = False
                        break
                    seen.update(t)
                if all_disjoint:
                    print(f"Found {k} disjoint triples:")
                    for t in candidate:
                        print(sorted(t))
                    return
    
    print(f"\nBest found: {len(solution)} disjoint triples")
