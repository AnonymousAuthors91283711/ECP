[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimum possible integer value of a double sum of floor functions under the constraint that the sum of 5 real numbers is 20. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible configurations and find the minimal sum.

The approach:
1. Since floor functions are involved, we can consider integer partitions of 20 (as non-integer values won't help minimize the sum)
2. For each partition of 20 into 5 non-negative integers, compute the double sum
3. Track the minimal sum found

```python
from itertools import combinations

def compute_sum(arr):
    total = 0
    for i in range(5):
        for j in range(i+1, 5):
            total += (arr[i] + arr[j]) // 1  # floor function
    return int(total)

def find_min_sum():
    min_sum = float('inf')
    # We'll limit the search to reasonable partitions (since larger numbers would increase the sum)
    max_val = 20  # Upper bound for any single element
    
    # Generate all non-decreasing partitions of 20 into 5 parts
    # This is more efficient than all permutations
    for a in range(0, max_val + 1):
        remaining = 20 - a
        if remaining < 0:
            continue
        for b in range(a, max_val + 1):
            remaining_b = remaining - b
            if remaining_b < 0:
                continue
            for c in range(b, max_val + 1):
                remaining_c = remaining_b - c
                if remaining_c < 0:
                    continue
                for d in range(c, max_val + 1):
                    e = remaining_c - d
                    if e < d:
                        continue
                    if e < 0:
                        continue
                    arr = [a, b, c, d, e]
                    current_sum = compute_sum(arr)
                    if current_sum < min_sum:
                        min_sum = current_sum
                        print(f"New min sum: {min_sum} for partition: {arr}")
    print(f"Final minimal sum: {min_sum}")

find_min_sum()
```
