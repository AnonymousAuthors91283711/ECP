Ground Truth Answer: 995 * 2^998
Proposed Answer: if 999 % 2 = 1 then 2^(998) else 0
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves permutations of Fin 999 and two functions f and g defined on them. The theorem sums (-1)^(f(π)+g(π)) over all permutations π.

2. The ground truth answer is 995 * 2^998, which is a specific positive value.

3. The proposed answer is a conditional: if 999 is odd (which it is), then 2^998, else 0. So it evaluates to 2^998.

4. Comparing the two:
   - 995 * 2^998 vs 2^998
   - These are clearly different by a factor of 995
   - The proposed answer is missing the 995 coefficient

5. The proposed answer correctly identifies that the result should be non-zero when n is odd, but fails to account for the full combinatorial factor.
