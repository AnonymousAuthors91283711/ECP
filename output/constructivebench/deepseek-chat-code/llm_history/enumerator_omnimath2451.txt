This problem involves counting the number of 5-element collections of subsets of a 6-element set where each element appears in an even number of subsets in the collection. We'll approach this by enumerating possible combinations for small cases to identify a pattern.

The Python program will:
1. Generate all possible 5-element combinations of subsets of {0,1,2,3,4,5}
2. For each combination, check if every element appears in an even number of subsets
3. Count the valid combinations

```python
from itertools import combinations

def solve():
    n = 6  # Size of the base set
    k = 5  # Size of the collection
    elements = range(n)
    all_subsets = [set(subset) for subset in combinations(elements, r) for r in range(n+1)]
    
    count = 0
    for candidate in combinations(all_subsets, k):
        valid = True
        for elem in elements:
            # Count how many subsets contain elem
            cnt = sum(1 for s in candidate if elem in s)
            if cnt % 2 != 0:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1
            print(f"Found valid combination #{count}")
    
    print(f"Total valid combinations: {count}")

# For efficiency, we'll limit to smaller parameters first
print("Running with reduced parameters for demonstration:")
n = 4
k = 3
elements = range(n)
all_subsets = [set(subset) for subset in combinations(elements, r) for r in range(n+1)]

count = 0
for candidate in combinations(all_subsets, k):
    valid = True
    for elem in elements:
        cnt = sum(1 for s in candidate if elem in s)
        if cnt % 2 != 0:
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        count += 1
        print(f"Found valid combination #{count}")

print(f"Total valid combinations for n={n}, k={k}: {count}")
```
