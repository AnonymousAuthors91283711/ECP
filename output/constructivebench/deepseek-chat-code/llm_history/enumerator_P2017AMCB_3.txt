This problem involves finding the value of (x + 3y)/(3x - y) given the condition (3x + y)/(x - 3y) = -2, where x and y are non-zero real numbers. We'll solve for the ratio k = y/x and compute the desired expression.

The approach is:
1. Solve the given equation for y in terms of x (or vice versa)
2. Substitute into the target expression to find its constant value
3. Verify with sample non-zero x and y values

```python
def solve_problem():
    # We'll test with various non-zero x values and compute corresponding y
    test_values = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.5, -1.0, -2.0]
    
    for x in test_values:
        if x == 0:
            continue
        # Solve (3x + y)/(x - 3y) = -2 for y
        # 3x + y = -2(x - 3y)
        # 3x + y = -2x + 6y
        # 5x = 5y => y = x
        y = x
        
        # Compute target expression (x + 3y)/(3x - y)
        numerator = x + 3*y
        denominator = 3*x - y
        if denominator == 0:
            print(f"x={x}: Division by zero")
            continue
        
        result = numerator / denominator
        print(f"For x={x}, y={y}: (x+3y)/(3x-y) = {result}")

    # The result is always 2.0 regardless of x value
    print("The constant value appears to be: 2.0")
