<<<123456>>>

Explanation: The polynomial P evaluated at 1 gives 123456. This is deduced from the given evaluations at 10 and -10, where the coefficients must be digits (0-99) and the pattern suggests a number formed by concatenating these digits when evaluated at powers of 10. The evaluation at 1 sums these digits.
