[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that there exist positive integers b and r with b + r = n, and the expression b*r*(b + r - 2)/2 equals 25. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of n and find the minimal one.

The approach is:
1. Iterate through possible values of n starting from 2 upwards
2. For each n, iterate through all possible pairs (b, r) where b + r = n and both are positive
3. Check if the given condition is satisfied
4. The first n that satisfies the condition is our answer

```python
def find_min_n():
    for n in range(2, 100):  # Reasonable upper bound
        for b in range(1, n):
            r = n - b
            if r <= 0:
                continue
            numerator = b * r * (b + r - 2)
            if numerator % 2 != 0:
                continue
            if numerator // 2 == 25:
                print(f"Found solution: n={n}, b={b}, r={r}")
                print(f"Minimal n is: {n}")
                return
    print("No solution found in range")

find_min_n()
```
