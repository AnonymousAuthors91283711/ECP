This problem involves a recursive sequence defined for xₙ and yₙ with given initial conditions. We need to compute x₂₀₁₂ modulo 100. Since directly computing up to 2012 is impractical, we'll look for periodicity in the sequence modulo 100.

The approach is to:
1. Compute the sequences xₙ and yₙ modulo 100
2. Track pairs (xₙ, yₙ) modulo 100 until we detect a cycle
3. Once the cycle length is found, use it to determine x₂₀₁₂ mod 100

```python
def compute_sequence_mod(limit=300, mod=100):
    # Initialize with given conditions
    x = [0] * (limit + 1)
    y = [0] * (limit + 1)
    x[1], y[1] = 1, 1
    x[2], y[2] = 1, 1
    
    # Compute sequence up to limit
    for n in range(3, limit + 1):
        x[n] = (x[n-1] * y[n-2] + x[n-2] * y[n-1]) % mod
        y[n] = (y[n-1] * y[n-2] - x[n-1] * x[n-2]) % mod
    
    # Look for periodicity by checking when initial state repeats
    for period in range(1, limit//2):
        if (x[1] == x[1+period] and y[1] == y[1+period] and
            x[2] == x[2+period] and y[2] == y[2+period]):
            print(f"Found period: {period}")
            # Compute x_2012 mod 100 using the period
            remainder = (2012 - 1) % period
            result = x[1 + remainder]
            print(f"x_2012 mod 100 = {result}")
            return
    
    print("No period found within the computed range")
