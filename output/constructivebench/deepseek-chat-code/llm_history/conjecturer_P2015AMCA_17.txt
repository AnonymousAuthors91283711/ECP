For n=8: probability = 34/256 = 0.1328125. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Looking at the enumerated answers, we can see the counts follow the Fibonacci sequence (2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34) shifted by 2 positions. The probability for n=8 is 34/256, which is exactly the 8th Fibonacci number (starting from F₁=1, F₂=1) divided by 2^8.

The error in the original proposed answer comes from using Real.sqrt 5 when we need exact rational arithmetic. Since we're working with ℚ, we should use the exact closed-form expression for Fibonacci numbers.

The correct answer should be the 9th Fibonacci number (since F₉=34) divided by 2^8. However, since Fibonacci numbers are typically indexed starting from F₀=0, F₁=1, we need to adjust the indexing to match our pattern.

<<<(34 : ℚ) / 256>>> 

Explanation:
1. The counts match Fibonacci numbers Fₙ₊₂ (2=F₂, 3=F₃, 5=F₄, etc.)
2. For n=8, count=34=F₉
3. Total possible functions is 2^8=256
4. The probability is therefore F₉/2^8 = 34/256
5. We cast to ℚ explicitly to ensure proper division
