The problem involves calculating the probability of an event occurring at least once in 5 independent trials, where each trial has a success probability of p = (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16. The complementary probability q = 1-p = 13/16. We need to compute 1 - q^5, which is the probability of at least one success in 5 trials.

Here's a Python program that calculates this probability exactly as a fraction:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Define the probabilities
p = Fraction(3, 4) * Fraction(1, 4)  # 3/16
q = 1 - p  # 13/16

# Calculate the probability of at least one success in 5 trials
result = 1 - q**5

# Print the exact fractional result
print(f"Exact probability: {result}")
```

The program outputs the exact probability as a fraction, which is the required answer. The calculation is done using exact arithmetic with Python's fractions module to avoid floating-point approximations. The result will be printed in fractional form, showing the exact value of omnimath1099_answer.
