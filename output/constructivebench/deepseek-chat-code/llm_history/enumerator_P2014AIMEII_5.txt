This problem involves finding the absolute value of b given certain conditions on cubic polynomials and their roots. We'll approach it by:
1. Modeling the polynomial conditions
2. Solving the system of equations symbolically
3. Finding all possible values of |b| that satisfy the conditions

The key insight is that if r and s are roots of the original polynomial, we can express a and b in terms of r and s, then use the shifted root conditions to establish relationships.

```python
import sympy as sp

def solve_problem():
    # Define variables
    r, s, a, b = sp.symbols('r s a b')
    
    # Original polynomial conditions (r and s are roots)
    eq1 = r**3 + a*r + b
    eq2 = s**3 + a*s + b
    
    # Shifted polynomial conditions
    eq3 = (r + 4)**3 + a*(r + 4) + (b + 240)
    eq4 = (s - 3)**3 + a*(s - 3) + (b + 240)
    
    # Solve the system of equations
    solutions = sp.solve([eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4], (a, b, r, s))
    
    # Filter real solutions and compute |b|
    b_values = set()
    for sol in solutions:
        # Check if solution components are real
        if all(sp.im(x) == 0 for x in sol):
            a_val, b_val, r_val, s_val = [sp.re(x) for x in sol]
            if r_val != s_val:  # Ensure distinct roots
                b_values.add(abs(b_val))
    
    # Print all possible |b| values
    for val in sorted(b_values):
        print(f"Found |b| = {val}")
    
    # The problem suggests there's only one valid solution
    if len(b_values) == 1:
        print(f"\nThe unique solution is |b| = {b_values.pop()}")

solve_problem()
```
