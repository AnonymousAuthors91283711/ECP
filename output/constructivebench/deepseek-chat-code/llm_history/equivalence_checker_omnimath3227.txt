theorem omnimath3227 :
  Real.log (∏ a in Finset.range 2015, ∏ b in Finset.range 2015, 
    (1 + exp (2 * π * I * (a * b : ℝ) / 2015))).re / Real.log 2 = omnimath3227_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 13725
Proposed Answer: (2015 * 2015 - 1) / 4
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating the real part of a complex logarithm of a product of terms involving roots of unity, then dividing by log(2).

2. The ground truth answer is 13725.

3. The proposed answer is (2015*2015 - 1)/4 = (4060225 - 1)/4 = 4060224/4 = 1015056.

4. Comparing the two:
   - 13725 ≠ 1015056
   - The proposed answer is significantly larger than the ground truth
   - The proposed formula doesn't match the actual value

The proposed answer is clearly incorrect as it gives a completely different value from the ground truth. The two answers are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
