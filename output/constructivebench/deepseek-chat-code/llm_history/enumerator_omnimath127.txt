[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimal number of distinct sums a(i)+a(j) where a is a strictly increasing sequence from 0 to 2n-1 with n+1 terms. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible sequences and count distinct sums for small n values.

The approach:
1. Generate all strictly increasing sequences starting at 0 and ending at 2n-1
2. For each sequence, compute all pairwise sums and count distinct values
3. Track the minimum count found

```python
import itertools

def main():
    for n in range(2, 7):  # Sample small values of n
        print(f"\nn = {n}")
        target = 2 * n - 1
        min_distinct = float('inf')
        
        # Generate all strictly increasing sequences a[0..n] with a[0]=0, a[n]=target
        # Using combinations to select intermediate values
        for inter in itertools.combinations(range(1, target), n-1):
            a = [0] + list(inter) + [target]
            sums = set()
            
            # Compute all pairwise sums
            for i in range(n+1):
                for j in range(i, n+1):  # j >= i to avoid duplicates
                    sums.add(a[i] + a[j])
            
            distinct = len(sums)
            if distinct < min_distinct:
                min_distinct = distinct
                print(f"New min {distinct} for sequence {a}")
        
        print(f"Minimum distinct sums for n={n}: {min_distinct}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
