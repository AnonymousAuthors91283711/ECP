[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of equations with four variables (a, b, c, d) that must satisfy certain relationships. The goal is to find all integer solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. The program will enumerate possible values of one variable and check if they lead to valid solutions for the other variables.

```python
def solve():
    # We'll express all variables in terms of c
    # From the equations:
    # a + 3 = 3c => a = 3c - 3
    # b - 3 = 3c => b = 3c + 3
    # d / 3 = 3c => d = 9c
    
    # The sum condition: a + b + c + d = 48
    # Substitute expressions: (3c-3) + (3c+3) + c + 9c = 48
    # Simplifies to: 16c = 48 => c = 3
    
    # Now compute other variables
    c = 3
    a = 3 * c - 3
    b = 3 * c + 3
    d = 9 * c
    
    # Verify the solution
    if (a + b + c + d == 48 and
        a + 3 == b - 3 and
        b - 3 == 3 * c and
        3 * c == d / 3):
        print(f"Solution found: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}")
