[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of equations where each x_k is defined in terms of the sum of all x_i minus x_k and minus k. The goal is to find the unique solution and specifically the value of x_49. We'll write a Python program to simulate this system for small values (n=5) to observe the pattern and conjecture the general solution.

```python
def solve_system(n):
    # The system can be rewritten as x_k = S - x_k - k, where S is sum of all x_i
    # Which simplifies to 2x_k = S - k => x_k = (S - k)/2
    # Summing all equations: S = nS/2 - (0+1+...+(n-1))/2
    # Solving for S: S = (n(n-1))/2
    # Then x_k = (n(n-1)/2 - k)/2 = (n(n-1) - 2k)/4
    S = n * (n - 1) / 2
    x = [(S - k) / 2 for k in range(n)]
    return x

# Test with small n=5 to observe pattern
n = 5
solution = solve_system(n)
print(f"For n={n}, solution is:")
for k, x_k in enumerate(solution):
    print(f"x_{k} = {x_k}")

# Now compute x_49 for n=100 (the actual problem)
n = 100
k = 49
x_49 = (n * (n - 1) - 2 * k) / 4
print(f"\nFor n=100, x_49 = {x_49}")
```
