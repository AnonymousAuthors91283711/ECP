[write_program]
This problem asks to find all real-valued functions f: ℝ → ℝ satisfying the functional equation:
∀x y, f(x - f(y)) = f(f(y)) + x*f(y) + f(x) - 1

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible polynomial solutions (a common approach for functional equations) by testing quadratic forms. The program will test coefficients for quadratic functions f(x) = ax² + bx + c to find matches.

```python
def test_quadratic_solution(a, b, c):
    """Check if f(x) = ax² + bx + c satisfies the functional equation."""
    def f(x):
        return a*x*x + b*x + c
    
    # Test the functional equation with sample x and y values
    test_values = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
    for x in test_values:
        for y in test_values:
            left = f(x - f(y))
            right = f(f(y)) + x*f(y) + f(x) - 1
            if not abs(left - right) < 1e-6:  # Account for floating point errors
                return False
    return True

def find_solutions():
    """Search for quadratic solutions by testing coefficient combinations."""
    # Reasonable range for coefficients based on typical functional equations
    coeff_range = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
    solutions = []
    
    for a in coeff_range:
        for b in coeff_range:
            for c in coeff_range:
                if test_quadratic_solution(a, b, c):
                    solutions.append((a, b, c))
                    print(f"Found solution: f(x) = {a}x² + {b}x + {c}")
    
    if solutions:
        print("\nAll found solutions:")
        for sol in solutions:
            print(f"f(x) = {sol[0]}x² + {sol[1]}x + {sol[2]}")
    else:
        print("No quadratic solutions found in the tested range.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solutions()
```
