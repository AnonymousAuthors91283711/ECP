[write_program]
This problem involves calculating the probability that when selecting a pair (s,t) from the Cartesian product of sets ΩS={1,2,3,4} and ΩT={1,2,3,4,5,6}, the condition s > t holds. We'll enumerate all possible pairs and count those satisfying s > t.

The program will:
1. Define the sets ΩS and ΩT
2. Generate all possible pairs (s,t)
3. Count pairs where s > t
4. Calculate the probability as count/(|ΩS|*|ΩT|)
5. Output the exact fraction

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    omega_s = {1, 2, 3, 4}
    omega_t = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
    total_pairs = len(omega_s) * len(omega_t)
    count = 0
    
    for s in omega_s:
        for t in omega_t:
            if s > t:
                count += 1
    
    probability = Fraction(count, total_pairs)
    print(probability)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
