The problem is to find the natural number that equals the expression `8 * 10^5 + 4 * 10^3 + 9 * 10 + 5`. This is a straightforward arithmetic calculation where we can evaluate each term and sum them up. The Python program will compute this value directly.

```python
# Calculate 8*10^5 + 4*10^3 + 9*10 + 5
result = 8 * 10**5 + 4 * 10**3 + 9 * 10 + 5
print(result)
```
