[write_program]
This problem asks for which positive integers n there exists a tuple of rational numbers (a₁,...,a_k) with k≥2, each a_i>0, such that their sum equals n and their product equals n. We'll write a Python program to enumerate such n values.

Key observations:
1. For k=2, we're looking for a₁ + a₂ = n and a₁*a₂ = n. This implies a₁ and a₂ are roots of x² - n x + n = 0, which must have rational solutions.
2. The discriminant n²-4n must be a perfect square for rational solutions to exist.
3. We'll check n values up to a reasonable threshold (100) and print those satisfying the condition.

```python
import math

def is_square(num):
    root = math.isqrt(num)
    return root * root == num

max_n = 100
print(f"Checking n values up to {max_n}:")
valid_n = []

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    # Check k=2 case first (most restrictive)
    discriminant = n * n - 4 * n
    if discriminant >= 0 and is_square(discriminant):
        valid_n.append(n)
        print(n)
    else:
        # Check higher k values (more flexible)
        # For k≥3, any n≥k works since we can use (1,...,1,2,n-k+1)
        # So we only need to check k=2 case
        pass

print("\nValid n values found:", valid_n)
```
