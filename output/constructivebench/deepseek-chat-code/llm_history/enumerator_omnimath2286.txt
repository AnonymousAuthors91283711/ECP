The problem asks for the probability that the sum of two standard 6-sided dice is at least 10. We'll enumerate all possible dice rolls (1-6 for each die) and count how many combinations satisfy the condition.

```python
count = 0
total = 0

for x in range(1, 7):
    for y in range(1, 7):
        total += 1
        if x + y >= 10:
            count += 1
            print(f"Found valid pair: ({x}, {y})")

probability = count / total
print(f"Probability: {probability} ({count}/36)")
```
