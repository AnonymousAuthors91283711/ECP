This problem asks for the number of distinct total values that can be formed by the expression 2*(5-k) + 3*k where k is a natural number â‰¤ 5. We'll enumerate all possible values of k from 0 to 5, compute the totals, and count the unique results.

```python
def enumerate_totals():
    unique_totals = set()
    for k in range(6):  # k from 0 to 5 inclusive
        total = 2 * (5 - k) + 3 * k
        print(f"k={k}: total={total}")  # Show each case
        unique_totals.add(total)
    
    print("\nUnique totals:", sorted(unique_totals))
    print("Number of distinct totals:", len(unique_totals))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_totals()
```
