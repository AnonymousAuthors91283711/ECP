[write_program]
The problem asks for the number of positive divisors of 900 that are perfect squares. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such divisors by:
1. Finding all divisors of 900
2. Checking which ones are perfect squares
3. Counting them

We'll factorize 900 first (2² × 3² × 5²) since this helps generate divisors efficiently.

```python
import math

def count_square_divisors():
    # Factorize 900 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2
    exponents = [2, 2, 2]  # exponents for primes 2, 3, 5
    
    # For each prime, the exponent in square divisor must be even and ≤ original exponent
    # Possible exponents: 0,2 for each prime (since original exponents are 2)
    count = 1
    for e in exponents:
        count *= (e // 2) + 1
    
    print(f"Number of square divisors of 900: {count}")

count_square_divisors()
```
