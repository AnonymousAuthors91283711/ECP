Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 8, 19), (2, 7, 13), (4, 5, 7)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, p-1, p) | p : ℕ} ∪ {(4, 5, 7), (2, 7, 13), (1, 8, 19)}
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. The ground truth provides three specific solutions: (1,8,19), (2,7,13), and (4,5,7).

2. The proposed answer has:
   - The same three specific solutions
   - Plus a general form (1, p-1, p) for any natural number p

The problem is about finding solutions where p is prime (hp : Nat.Prime p). The proposed answer's general form (1, p-1, p) would include many invalid solutions where p is not prime or where the equation x³ + y³ = p*(x*y + p) doesn't hold.

Only the three specific cases in the ground truth actually satisfy all conditions of the problem. The general form in the proposed answer is too broad and incorrect.
