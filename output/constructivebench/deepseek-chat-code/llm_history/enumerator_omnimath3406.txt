This problem appears to be a simple fraction calculation where we need to compute bananas/(apples + bananas). The values are given as apples = 12 and bananas = 15 + 3 = 18. The task is to compute the exact rational value of 18/(12+18).

Here's a Python program that calculates this exact fraction in reduced form:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    apples = 12
    bananas = 15 + 3
    total_fruits = apples + bananas
    answer = Fraction(bananas, total_fruits)
    print(f"Answer: {answer}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program uses Python's `fractions.Fraction` to maintain exact rational arithmetic and automatically reduce the fraction to simplest form. The output will be the exact value 3/5.
