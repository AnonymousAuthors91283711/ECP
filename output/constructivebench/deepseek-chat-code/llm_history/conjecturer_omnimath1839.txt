Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
From the enumerated answers, we can observe the average converging around 5.666..., which suggests the exact value might be 17/3. This makes sense combinatorially as each position has a certain probability of satisfying the condition, and 17/3 ≈ 5.666... matches the empirical data.

<<<17/3>>>
