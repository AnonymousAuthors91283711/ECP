This problem asks to find the real value of x that satisfies the equation âˆš(100 - x) = 9. We can solve this algebraically by squaring both sides and solving for x. The Python program will verify this solution by checking the equation for different x values.

```python
def check_solution(x):
    return (100 - x)**0.5 == 9

# We know algebraically that the solution is x = 100 - 9^2 = 19
# Let's verify this and also check nearby values to confirm uniqueness
for x in range(15, 25):
    if check_solution(x):
        print(f"Found solution: x = {x}")
        break
else:
    print("No integer solution found in range")

# For completeness, check the exact floating point value
x_exact = 100 - 9**2
if check_solution(x_exact):
    print(f"Exact solution: x = {x_exact}")
```
