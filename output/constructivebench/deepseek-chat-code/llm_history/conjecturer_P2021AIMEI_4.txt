Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated triples, we can observe that for each fixed 'a', 'b' ranges from a+1 to (66-a-1)/2, and 'c' is determined as 66-a-b. The pattern suggests the count is the sum over possible 'a' values of the number of valid 'b' values for each 'a'. For a=1, there are 31 possibilities (b=2..32), for a=2 there are 29 (b=3..31), etc., decreasing by 2 each time until a=21 (b=22,23). This forms an arithmetic sequence.
