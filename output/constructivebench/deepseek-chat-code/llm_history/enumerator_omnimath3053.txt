[write_program]
This problem asks to find the positive real number g such that g² - 6² = 45. We'll write a Python program to solve this equation numerically and verify the solution.

The equation simplifies to g² = 45 + 36 → g² = 81 → g = 9 (since g > 0). However, since we're asked to write an enumerator program, we'll approach this by testing values around the expected solution.

```python
def solve_equation():
    # We know the exact solution is 9, but we'll demonstrate verification
    # by testing values around it with small increments
    epsilon = 0.0001
    target = 45
    g = 8.0  # starting below expected solution
    
    print("Testing values around expected solution:")
    while g <= 10.0:
        current = g**2 - 6**2
        print(f"g = {g:.5f}, g² - 6² = {current:.5f}")
        if abs(current - target) < epsilon:
            print(f"\nFound solution within tolerance {epsilon}: g = {g:.5f}")
            break
        g += 0.1
