[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of equations with real numbers p and q. The first equation relates q to p (q = (2/5)*p), and the second equation states that their product is 90 (p*q = 90). We'll write a program to find the exact value of p that satisfies both equations.

Since this is a simple quadratic system, we can solve it algebraically by substitution, but we'll write a program to verify the solution numerically. We'll use floating-point arithmetic to approximate the solution while being aware of potential floating-point errors.

```python
def solve_omnimath2672():
    # We know q = (2/5)*p and p*q = 90
    # Substitute q into second equation: p*(2/5)*p = 90 => (2/5)*p² = 90
    # => p² = 90*(5/2) = 225 => p = ±15
    # We'll verify these solutions numerically
    
    # Test positive solution
    p = 15.0
    q = (2/5) * p
    product = p * q
    print(f"Testing p = {p}:")
    print(f"  q = {q}, p*q = {product}")
    
    # Test negative solution
    p = -15.0
    q = (2/5) * p
    product = p * q
    print(f"Testing p = {p}:")
    print(f"  q = {q}, p*q = {product}")
