[write_program]
This problem involves finding integers a, b, c, d > 0 such that:
1. a³ = b²
2. c⁵ = d⁴
3. c - a = 77
and then computing d - b.

We'll search for solutions by:
1. Finding perfect squares (since b must be integer)
2. Checking if their cube roots are integers (for a)
3. For each valid a, compute c = a + 77
4. Check if c is a perfect 4th power (since d must be integer)
5. Verify if c⁵ is a perfect 4th power (for d)

Here's the Python program to enumerate possible solutions:

```python
import math

def find_solutions():
    max_a = 1000  # Reasonable upper bound for a
    for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
        # Check if a^3 is perfect square (b^2)
        b_squared = a ** 3
        b = int(math.isqrt(b_squared))
        if b * b != b_squared:
            continue
        
        c = a + 77
        if c <= 0:
            continue
            
        # Check if c^5 is perfect 4th power (d^4)
        c_pow_5 = c ** 5
        d_4th = c_pow_5
        d = round(d_4th ** (1/4))
        if d ** 4 != d_4th:
            continue
            
        print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, d-b={d-b}")

find_solutions()
```

The program will output all valid solutions within the given range. For the actual competition problem, we would need to analyze the output to determine the correct value of d - b. The program is designed to find all possible solutions efficiently by checking the necessary conditions.
