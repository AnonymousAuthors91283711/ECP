[write_program]
This problem asks for the largest positive integer N satisfying the floor function equation:
⌊N/3⌋ = ⌊N/5⌋ + ⌊N/7⌋ - ⌊N/35⌋

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible N values up to a reasonable threshold (1000) to find the maximum solution. The program will check each N in descending order and stop when it finds the first (largest) solution.

```python
def main():
    max_N = 1000  # Reasonable upper bound
    for N in range(max_N, 0, -1):  # Check from largest to smallest
        left = N // 3
        right = (N // 5) + (N // 7) - (N // 35)
        if left == right:
            print(f"Found solution: {N}")
            return  # Stop after finding the largest solution
    print("No solution found below the threshold")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
