The problem involves finding the value of f(9) - f(3) given a functional equation and a condition on the ratio f(3)/f(6). We'll write a Python program to explore possible values of k that satisfy the given condition, then compute f(9) - f(3).

The key steps are:
1. The function is defined as f(x) = 2^(x*k) + 9
2. The condition is f(3)/f(6) = 1/3
3. We need to find k that satisfies this condition
4. Then compute f(9) - f(3)

We'll use numerical methods to find k and verify the condition, then compute the required difference.

```python
import math

def find_k():
    # We'll use binary search to find k that satisfies the condition
    def f(x, k):
        return 2 ** (x * k) + 9
    
    def condition(k):
        f3 = f(3, k)
        f6 = f(6, k)
        return f3 / f6 - 1/3  # We want this to be 0
    
    # Binary search parameters
    low = -10.0
    high = 10.0
    tolerance = 1e-10
    max_iter = 100
    
    for _ in range(max_iter):
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        val = condition(mid)
        if abs(val) < tolerance:
            return mid
        if val > 0:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    return (low + high) / 2

def main():
    k = find_k()
    print(f"Found k ≈ {k}")
    
    def f(x):
        return 2 ** (x * k) + 9
    
    f3 = f(3)
    f9 = f(9)
    result = f9 - f3
    print(f"f(9) - f(3) ≈ {result}")
    print(f"Exact form might be 2^(9k) - 2^(3k)")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program first finds the value of k that satisfies the condition f(3)/f(6) = 1/3 using binary search. Then it computes f(9) - f(3) using the found value of k. The output shows both the numerical approximation and suggests the exact form might involve powers of 2 with exponents 9k and 3k.
