This problem appears to be about finding integer solutions where Friday points equal 80% of Wednesday points. Since 80% = 4/5, we need to find Wednesday points (w) where 4w/5 is an integer (Friday points f). This means w must be divisible by 5.

The Python program will:
1. Iterate through possible Wednesday points (w)
2. Calculate Friday points (f = 4w//5)
3. Print valid (w,f) pairs where f is exactly 80% of w
4. Stop after finding several examples to show the pattern

```python
def enumerate_80_percent_pairs(max_w=100):
    print("Wednesday Points | Friday Points")
    print("-----------------|--------------")
    for w in range(1, max_w + 1):
        if (4 * w) % 5 == 0:  # Check if 80% of w is integer
            f = (4 * w) // 5
            print(f"{w:15} | {f:12}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_80_percent_pairs()
```
