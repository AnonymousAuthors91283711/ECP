Ground Truth Answer: 112
Proposed Answer: 2
Let me analyze this problem carefully.

The problem defines a recursive sequence aime_sequence with initial terms:
- aime_sequence 0 = 2
- aime_sequence 1 = 5
- aime_sequence 2 = 8
- For n ≥ 0, aime_sequence (n+3) = (4 * (sum of previous three terms)) mod 11

The question asks for the product of three specific terms:
aime_sequence 2018 * aime_sequence 2020 * aime_sequence 2022

The ground truth answer is 112, while the proposed answer is 2.

Key observations:
1. The sequence is periodic modulo 11 (since there are only finitely many possible triplets modulo 11)
2. The period can be found by computing terms until they repeat
3. The product of any three terms in the sequence modulo 11 should be considered

The proposed answer of 2 is clearly different from the ground truth answer of 112. Even if we consider modulo 11, 112 mod 11 = 2, but the problem doesn't specify that the answer should be modulo 11. The ground truth answer appears to be the actual product, not modulo 11.
