[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer d such that there exist integers x and y satisfying 300x + 210y = d. This is equivalent to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 300 and 210, since the smallest positive linear combination of two numbers is their GCD.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Compute the GCD of 300 and 210 using the Euclidean algorithm
2. Verify that this GCD can indeed be expressed as a linear combination of 300 and 210
3. Show the coefficients x and y that satisfy the equation

```python
def gcd_extended(a, b):
    # Extended Euclidean algorithm that returns (gcd, x, y) such that ax + by = gcd
    if a == 0:
        return (b, 0, 1)
    else:
        g, y, x = gcd_extended(b % a, a)
        return (g, x - (b // a) * y, y)

def main():
    a, b = 300, 210
    g, x, y = gcd_extended(a, b)
    print(f"GCD of {a} and {b} is: {g}")
    print(f"Verification: {a}*({x}) + {b}*({y}) = {a*x + b*y}")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
