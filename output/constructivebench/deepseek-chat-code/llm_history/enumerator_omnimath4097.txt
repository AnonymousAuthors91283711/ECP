[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimum value of the expression (2-a³)/a + (2-b³)/b + (2-c³)/c under the constraints a,b,c > 0 and a+b+c=3. We'll write a Python program to explore this numerically by sampling possible values.

The approach:
1. Sample positive triples (a,b,c) that sum to 3
2. Calculate the expression value for each triple
3. Track the minimum value found

We'll use a grid search with small step sizes to approximate the minimum. The symmetry suggests the minimum might occur when a=b=c=1.

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_expression(a, b, c):
    return (2 - a**3)/a + (2 - b**3)/b + (2 - c**3)/c

def find_minimum():
    min_value = float('inf')
    step = 0.05  # Smaller step for better precision
    
    # Search around symmetric case first
    for a in np.arange(0.5, 1.5, step):
        remaining = 3 - a
        for b in np.arange(max(0.5, remaining - 1.0), min(1.5, remaining - 0.5) + step, step):
            c = 3 - a - b
            if c <= 0:
                continue
            current = calculate_expression(a, b, c)
            if current < min_value:
                min_value = current
                print(f"New minimum: {current:.6f} at (a,b,c)=({a:.3f},{b:.3f},{c:.3f})")
    
    # Check symmetric case explicitly
    sym_value = calculate_expression(1, 1, 1)
    print(f"\nSymmetric case (1,1,1): {sym_value}")
    
    print(f"\nFinal minimum found: {min_value:.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_minimum()
```
