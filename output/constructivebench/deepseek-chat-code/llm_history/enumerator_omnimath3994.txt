This problem involves finding the maximum sum of 3x3 submatrices in a 5x5 binary matrix with certain constraints on the positions of 1s and 0s. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible 5x5 binary matrices under these constraints and find the maximum 3x3 submatrix sum.

The constraints are:
1. Matrix entries are 0 or 1
2. Every 1 must have an odd index (1D position ≤ 25)
3. Every 0 must have an even index (1D position ≤ 25)
4. We need to find the maximum sum of any 3x3 submatrix

```python
import itertools

def main():
    max_sum = 0
    n = 5
    # Generate all possible 5x5 binary matrices with the given constraints
    for matrix in itertools.product([0, 1], repeat=n*n):
        valid = True
        # Check constraints for each element
        for pos in range(n*n):
            k = pos + 1  # positions are 1-based
            if matrix[pos] == 1 and k % 2 != 1:
                valid = False
                break
            if matrix[pos] == 0 and k % 2 != 0:
                valid = False
                break
        if not valid:
            continue
        
        # Reshape to 5x5 matrix
        mat = [matrix[i*n:(i+1)*n] for i in range(n)]
        
        # Find maximum 3x3 submatrix sum
        current_max = 0
        for i in range(3):  # rows
            for j in range(3):  # cols
                total = sum(mat[x][y] for x in range(i, i+3) for y in range(j, j+3))
                if total > current_max:
                    current_max = total
                    if current_max > max_sum:
                        max_sum = current_max
                        print(f"New max found: {max_sum}")
    
    print(f"Final maximum 3x3 submatrix sum: {max_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note: The full enumeration of all 2^25 possible matrices is computationally infeasible. In practice, you would need a more optimized approach or mathematical insight to solve this problem. The code above demonstrates the conceptual approach but would need to be modified with optimizations or constraints to run in reasonable time. The actual solution likely involves recognizing patterns in the matrix structure that satisfy the given constraints while maximizing the 3x3 submatrix sums.
