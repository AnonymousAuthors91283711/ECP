Ground Truth Answer: {r : ℝ | r > 3 ∨ r < 49 / 27}
Proposed Answer: {r : ℝ | r < -13 / 27}
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the range of a cubic polynomial P(z) = z³ + z² - z + 2 when z is non-real complex numbers.

2. The ground truth answer claims the range is all real numbers either greater than 3 or less than 49/27.

3. The proposed answer claims the range is all real numbers less than -13/27.

Analysis:
- For cubic polynomials with non-real inputs, the range typically covers all real numbers except possibly a finite interval.
- Calculating critical points of P(x) for real x gives us x = -1 and x = 1/3.
- Evaluating P at these points: P(-1) = 3 and P(1/3) ≈ 49/27.
- The behavior at infinity shows P(x) → -∞ as x → -∞ and P(x) → +∞ as x → +∞.
- For non-real inputs, the polynomial will cover all real values except those strictly between the local minimum (49/27) and local maximum (3).

The ground truth correctly identifies this range (r > 3 or r < 49/27), while the proposed answer is completely different and incorrect.
