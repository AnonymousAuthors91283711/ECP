This problem involves finding the difference between the maximum and minimum possible values of B (the number of students taking both subjects) given constraints on S (students taking Spanish) and F (students taking French). The total number of students is 2001. We'll enumerate possible values of S and F within their bounds, compute B, and track the min/max valid B values.

```python
def main():
    total = 2001
    S_lb = (80 * total) // 100  # 1600
    S_ub = (85 * total) // 100  # 1700
    F_lb = (30 * total) // 100  # 600
    F_ub = (40 * total) // 100  # 800
    
    min_B = float('inf')
    max_B = -float('inf')
    
    # Iterate through possible S and F values
    for S in range(S_lb, S_ub + 1):
        for F in range(F_lb, F_ub + 1):
            B = S + F - total
            if B >= 0 and B <= min(S, F):  # Valid B must be non-negative and <= both S and F
                if B < min_B:
                    min_B = B
                    print(f"New min B found: {B} (S={S}, F={F})")
                if B > max_B:
                    max_B = B
                    print(f"New max B found: {B} (S={S}, F={F})")
    
    print(f"Final difference: {max_B - min_B}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
