    (omnimath3864_answer n) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 
Testing n = 2
Trying k = 1
Trying k = 2
Trying k = 3
Possible minimal k found: 3
For n = 2, minimal k appears to be 3

Testing n = 3
Trying k = 1
Trying k = 2
Trying k = 3
Trying k = 4
Trying k = 5
Possible minimal k found: 5
For n = 3, minimal k appears to be 5

Testing n = 4
Trying k = 1
Trying k = 2
Trying k = 3
Trying k = 4
Trying k = 5
Trying k = 6
Trying k = 7
Possible minimal k found: 7
For n = 4, minimal k appears to be 7. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Looking at the pattern from the enumerated answers:
n=2 → k=3
n=3 → k=5
n=4 → k=7

The pattern suggests k = 2n - 1. This linear relationship fits all given cases.
