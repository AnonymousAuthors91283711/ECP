[write_program]
The problem asks for the count of integers k between 1 and 50 such that there exist integers a > b with a - b = k, and the greatest common divisor of (a³ - b³) and (a - b)³ is square-free (i.e., not divisible by any prime squared).

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Iterate through all k from 1 to 50
2. For each k, find a pair (a,b) where a - b = k
3. Check if gcd(a³ - b³, (a - b)³) is square-free
4. Count all k that satisfy this condition

```python
import math

def is_squarefree(n):
    if n == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % (i*i) == 0:
            return False
    return True

count = 0
for k in range(1, 51):
    # We can choose a = k+1, b = 1 as a minimal pair
    a = k + 1
    b = 1
    # Compute a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) = k*(a^2 + ab + b^2)
    # (a-b)^3 = k^3
    # So gcd is k * gcd(a^2 + ab + b^2, k^2)
    # But since a = b + k, we can substitute:
    term = a*a + a*b + b*b
    g = math.gcd(term, k*k)
    total_gcd = k * g
    if is_squarefree(total_gcd):
        count += 1
        print(f"Found valid k: {k}")

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
