Ground Truth Answer: 2^32
Proposed Answer: 3221225472
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest natural number n < 4,300,000,000 that can be expressed either as:
   - n = 1, or
   - n = 2^k * product of Fermat primes (primes of form 2^(2^m) + 1)

2. The ground truth answer is 2^32 = 4,294,967,296

3. The proposed answer is 3,221,225,472 = 2^31 * 3

Comparison:
- 2^32 is indeed greater than the proposed answer (4,294,967,296 > 3,221,225,472)
- However, 2^32 = 4,294,967,296 > 4,300,000,000, so it doesn't satisfy n < 4,300,000,000
- The proposed answer 3,221,225,472 is less than 4,300,000,000
- 3 is a known Fermat prime (2^(2^0)+1), so the factorization is valid

The ground truth answer is actually invalid because it exceeds the upper bound, while the proposed answer satisfies all conditions. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
