This problem asks for the number of integer pairs (x,y) where:
1. y = 4x + 3
2. 25 < x < 75
3. 120 < y < 250

We'll enumerate all possible x values in the range (25,75), compute y for each, and count those where y falls in (120,250).

```python
def count_pairs():
    count = 0
    # x must be integer between 26 and 74 (inclusive)
    for x in range(26, 75):
        y = 4 * x + 3
        if 120 < y < 250:
            count += 1
            print(f"Found pair: ({x}, {y})")  # Stream partial results
    print(f"Total count: {count}")  # Final answer

count_pairs()
```
