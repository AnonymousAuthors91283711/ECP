[write_program]
The problem appears to be a simple arithmetic calculation (0.3 * 200) that equals 60. Since this is straightforward, I'll create a Python program that verifies this calculation and outputs the result.

```python
# Simple verification of 0.3 * 200
result = 0.3 * 200
print(result)  # Outputs 60.0
```
