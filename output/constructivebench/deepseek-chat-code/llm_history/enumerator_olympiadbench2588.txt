[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of recurrence relations for sequences A and B with given initial conditions. We'll write a Python program to compute the values of A and B up to k=4 to find A[4].

The recurrence relations are:
A[k] = (A[k-1] + A[k+1] + B[k]) / 3
B[k] = (B[k-1] + B[k+1] + A[k]) / 3

Given initial conditions:
A[0] = 0, A[1] = 0, A[2] = 0, A[3] = 1

We'll need to solve for B values and A[4] using these relations.

```python
def solve_recurrence():
    # Initialize known A values
    A = {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 1}
    B = {}  # B values to be determined
    
    # We'll need to express B[k] in terms of other values
    # From the recurrence relations, we can derive:
    # For k=1:
    # A[1] = (A[0] + A[2] + B[1])/3 => B[1] = 0
    # B[1] = (B[0] + B[2] + A[1])/3 => B[0] + B[2] = 0
    
    # For k=2:
    # A[2] = (A[1] + A[3] + B[2])/3 => B[2] = -1
    # B[2] = (B[1] + B[3] + A[2])/3 => B[3] = -3
    
    # Now we can find B[0] from B[0] + B[2] = 0 => B[0] = 1
    
    # For k=3:
    # A[3] = (A[2] + A[4] + B[3])/3 => 1 = (0 + A[4] - 3)/3 => A[4] = 6
    
    # Let's verify all these calculations:
    B[1] = 0
    B[2] = -1
    B[0] = 1
    B[3] = -3
    
    # Now compute A[4]
    A[4] = 3 * A[3] - A[2] - B[3]
    
    print("Computed values:")
    print(f"A[0] = {A[0]}")
    print(f"A[1] = {A[1]}")
    print(f"A[2] = {A[2]}")
    print(f"A[3] = {A[3]}")
    print(f"A[4] = {A[4]}")
    print("\nIntermediate B values:")
    print(f"B[0] = {B[0]}")
    print(f"B[1] = {B[1]}")
    print(f"B[2] = {B[2]}")
    print(f"B[3] = {B[3]}")
