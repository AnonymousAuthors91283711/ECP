abbrev mathodyssey78_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem mathodyssey78 : 
  ∃ (a : ℕ → ℕ), 
    a 0 = 0 ∧ 
    a 1 = 1 ∧ 
    (∀ n, a (2 * n) = a n) ∧ 
    (∀ n, a (2 * n + 1) = a n + 1) ∧ 
    a 2024 = mathodyssey78_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 7. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the problem's recursive definition and the enumerated answer for 2024 being 7, I notice this matches the binary digit sum (number of 1s in binary representation) of 2024. The binary representation of 2024 is 11111100000, which has 7 ones.

<<<7>>>
