This problem asks for the maximum number of pairs of cells (r1, r2) in a 5x5 grid with integer entries where r1 is top-left of r2 (i.e., r1's row and column are both less than r2's), and the sum of the four corners of the rectangle formed by r1 and r2 is odd. We'll enumerate all possible 5x5 binary grids (since parity is all that matters) to find the maximum count.

```python
from itertools import product

def count_odd_rectangles(grid):
    count = 0
    for i1 in range(5):
        for j1 in range(5):
            for i2 in range(i1 + 1, 5):
                for j2 in range(j1 + 1, 5):
                    if (grid[i1][j1] + grid[i1][j2] + grid[i2][j1] + grid[i2][j2]) % 2 == 1:
                        count += 1
    return count

def generate_grids():
    # We'll use binary grids (0/1) since only parity matters
    max_count = 0
    best_grids = []
    
    # Since enumerating all 2^25 grids is infeasible, we'll use symmetry and sampling
    # Here we'll try checkerboard patterns which are likely optimal
    for pattern in [0, 1]:
        grid = [[(i + j + pattern) % 2 for j in range(5)] for i in range(5)]
        cnt = count_odd_rectangles(grid)
        print(f"Checkerboard {pattern}: {cnt} odd rectangles")
        if cnt > max_count:
            max_count = cnt
            best_grids = [grid]
        elif cnt == max_count:
            best_grids.append(grid)
    
    # Also try other symmetric patterns
    test_grids = [
        [[1 if i == j else 0 for j in range(5)] for i in range(5)],  # Diagonal
        [[1 if i <= j else 0 for j in range(5)] for i in range(5)],  # Upper triangular
        [[1 if (i < 2 and j < 2) else 0 for j in range(5)] for i in range(5)],  # 2x2 block
    ]
    
    for grid in test_grids:
        cnt = count_odd_rectangles(grid)
        print(f"Test pattern: {cnt} odd rectangles")
        if cnt > max_count:
            max_count = cnt
            best_grids = [grid]
        elif cnt == max_count:
            best_grids.append(grid)
    
    print(f"\nMaximum number of odd rectangles found: {max_count}")

generate_grids()
```
