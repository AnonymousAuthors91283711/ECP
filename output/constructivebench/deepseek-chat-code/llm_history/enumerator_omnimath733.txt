This problem involves finding natural numbers n that satisfy several conditions:
1. n+1 is divisible by 210
2. Sum of digits equals twice the number of digits
3. Number of digits ≤ 12
4. Even digit positions contain even digits, odd positions contain odd digits

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such numbers up to 12 digits. The program will check each candidate number that's 1 less than a multiple of 210.

```python
def is_valid(n):
    s = str(n)
    length = len(s)
    # Check digit sum condition
    if sum(int(d) for d in s) != 2 * length:
        return False
    # Check even/odd digit positions
    for i in range(length):
        digit = int(s[i])
        # Positions are 0-indexed: even index (0,2,...) should have even digit
        if (i % 2 == 0) != (digit % 2 == 0):
            return False
    return True

# Enumerate numbers n where n+1 is divisible by 210 and has ≤12 digits
max_n = 10**12 - 1
k = 1
while True:
    candidate = 210 * k - 1
    if candidate > max_n:
        break
    if is_valid(candidate):
        print(candidate)
    k += 1
```
