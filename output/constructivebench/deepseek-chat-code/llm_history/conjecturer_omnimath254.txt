theorem omnimath254 :
  IsLeast {s : ℕ | ∃ a b : ℕ, 0 < a ∧ a < 2012 ∧ 0 < b ∧ b < 2012 ∧ a ≠ b ∧
    s = Finset.card (Finset.filter (fun k => (a * k) % 2012 > (b * k) % 2012) (Finset.Ico 1 2012))} 
  omnimath254_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: New min count: 1006 for (a=1, b=2)
New min count: 1005 for (a=1, b=3)
New min count: 1004 for (a=1, b=5)

Final minimal count: 1004. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the enumerated answers and the pattern where the minimal count decreases as the difference between a and b increases (1006, 1005, 1004), while 2012/2 = 1006, the minimal count appears to be 2012/2 - 2 = 1004 when a=1 and b=5 (the largest coprime difference in the examples).

<<<1004>>>
