[write_program]
This problem asks for the maximum possible value of x + y + z where x, y, z are integers satisfying the equation 10x³ + 20y³ + 2006xyz = 2007z³. We'll write a Python program to search for solutions with small integer values.

The approach:
1. Search z values from 0 upwards (since larger z might give larger sums)
2. For each z, search x and y in a reasonable range around z
3. Check if the equation holds and track the maximum sum found

```python
def main():
    max_sum = -float('inf')
    best_solution = None
    
    # Search z from 0 to 50 (empirically determined reasonable range)
    for z in range(0, 51):
        # Search x and y in [-100,100] which covers reasonable cases
        for x in range(-100, 101):
            for y in range(-100, 101):
                left = 10*x**3 + 20*y**3 + 2006*x*y*z
                right = 2007*z**3
                if left == right:
                    current_sum = x + y + z
                    if current_sum > max_sum:
                        max_sum = current_sum
                        best_solution = (x, y, z)
                        print(f"New max sum: {max_sum} with (x,y,z)={best_solution}")
    
    print(f"\nFinal maximum sum found: {max_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
