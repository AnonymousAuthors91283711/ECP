Ground Truth Answer: fun (a, b, c) => {(10^(4 : ℝ), 10^(3 : ℝ), 10^(10 : ℝ)), (10^(2 : ℝ), 10^(-1 : ℝ), 10^(-2 : ℝ))}
Proposed Answer: fun ⟨a, b, c⟩ => if a = -4 ∧ b = 4 ∧ c = -18 then {(1/8, 1/5, 1/25)} else ∅
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves solving a system of logarithmic equations with constraints on x,y,z being positive and specific values for a,b,c (-4,4,-18 respectively).

2. The ground truth answer provides two exact solutions in exponential form (powers of 10).

3. The proposed answer provides one solution in fractional form (1/8, 1/5, 1/25) only when a=-4, b=4, c=-18.

Now let's check if the solutions are equivalent:
- (1/8, 1/5, 1/25) ≈ (0.125, 0.2, 0.04)
- The first ground truth solution (10^4, 10^3, 10^10) = (10000, 1000, 10^10) is completely different
- The second ground truth solution (10^2, 10^-1, 10^-2) = (100, 0.1, 0.01) is also different

The proposed answer doesn't match either of the ground truth solutions, and is missing one of them entirely. Therefore:

<<<False>>>
