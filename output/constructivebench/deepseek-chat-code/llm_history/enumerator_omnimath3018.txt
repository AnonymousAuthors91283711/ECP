This problem asks for a subset T of size 3 from S = {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 20} where the product of elements is 80 and the sum is to be determined. We'll enumerate all possible 3-element subsets of S, check if their product is 80, and print the sums of valid subsets.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def main():
    S = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 20]
    target_product = 80
    
    print("Checking all 3-element subsets of", S)
    print("Looking for subsets with product =", target_product)
    print("Valid subsets and their sums:")
    
    valid_sums = set()
    for subset in combinations(S, 3):
        product = subset[0] * subset[1] * subset[2]
        if product == target_product:
            current_sum = sum(subset)
            print(f"Subset {subset} has sum {current_sum}")
            valid_sums.add(current_sum)
    
    if valid_sums:
        print("\nAll valid sums found:", valid_sums)
    else:
        print("No valid subsets found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
