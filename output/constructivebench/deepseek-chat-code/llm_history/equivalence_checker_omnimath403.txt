abbrev omnimath403_answer : Set (ℤ × ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath403 (m n : ℤ) : 231 * m^2 = 130 * n^2 ↔ (m, n) ∈ omnimath403_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0)}
Proposed Answer: { (k * 130, k * 231) | (k : ℤ) } ∪ { (k * 130, -k * 231) | (k : ℤ) }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation is 231 * m² = 130 * n²
2. Ground truth gives only the trivial solution (0,0)
3. Proposed answer gives parametric solutions (k*130, ±k*231)

Testing the proposed solution:
For any k, if we plug (k*130, k*231) into the equation:
231*(k*130)² = 231*k²*16900
130*(k*231)² = 130*k²*53361
These are not equal (231*16900 ≠ 130*53361), so the proposed solutions don't satisfy the equation.

The only solution that works is (0,0), as:
231*0² = 130*0² → 0 = 0

<<<False>>>
