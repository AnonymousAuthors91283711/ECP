Ground Truth Answer: 95
Proposed Answer: 4583
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest rational number r satisfying certain conditions, and then wants the sum of the numerator and denominator of that number in reduced form.

2. The ground truth answer is 95, which suggests the reduced form of r is a fraction where numerator + denominator = 95.

3. The proposed answer is 4583, which is much larger and doesn't match the ground truth.

4. Let's verify the calculation:
   - The expression simplifies to r = 6/7 + 5/49 * (49/48) = 6/7 + 5/48
   - Finding common denominator: 6/7 = 288/336, 5/48 = 35/336
   - Sum: 323/336
   - 323 + 336 = 659 (not 95 or 4583)

However, the ground truth answer 95 suggests the fraction might be 47/48 (47+48=95), which doesn't match our calculation. The proposed answer 4583 is clearly incorrect.
