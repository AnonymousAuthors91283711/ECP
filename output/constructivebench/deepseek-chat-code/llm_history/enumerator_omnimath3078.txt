[write_program]
This problem appears to be about evaluating a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous term squared minus 5. The sequence starts with x=2, then y=x²-5, and z=y²-5. We'll write a Python program to compute this sequence and print the intermediate values.

```python
def compute_sequence(initial_value, steps):
    current = initial_value
    for i in range(steps + 1):
        print(f"Step {i}: {current}")
        current = current ** 2 - 5

# Compute the sequence starting with x=2 for 2 steps (to get z)
print("Computing sequence starting with x=2:")
compute_sequence(2, 2)

# Optional: Show the pattern continues by computing more steps
print("\nComputing more steps to show pattern:")
compute_sequence(2, 5)
```
