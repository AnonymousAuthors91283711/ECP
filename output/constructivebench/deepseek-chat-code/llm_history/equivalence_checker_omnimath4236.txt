Ground Truth Answer: fun c => c * (c^2 / 4)
Proposed Answer: fun c => c * (c - 2) / 4
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: c * (c² / 4)
2. Proposed: c * (c - 2) / 4

Let's simplify both expressions for an even c (let c = 2k where k ≥ 2 since c ≥ 4):

Ground Truth:
c * (c² / 4) = 2k * ((2k)² / 4) = 2k * (4k² / 4) = 2k * k² = 2k³

Proposed:
c * (c - 2) / 4 = 2k * (2k - 2) / 4 = 2k * 2(k - 1) / 4 = 4k(k - 1)/4 = k(k - 1)

These are clearly different functions (2k³ vs k(k-1)). For example:
When c=4 (k=2):
- Ground Truth: 2*2³ = 16
- Proposed: 2*(2-1) = 2

The answers are not equivalent.
