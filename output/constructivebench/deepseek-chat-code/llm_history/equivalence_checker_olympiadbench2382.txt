    T n = olympiadbench2382_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => match n with
    | 10 => 2
    | 11 => 4
    | 12 => 3
    | _ => 0
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n % 12 = 10 then 2 else if n % 12 = 11 then 4 else if n % 12 = 0 then 3 else 0
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. The ground truth answer provides exact values for n=10,11,12 and 0 otherwise.
2. The proposed answer uses modulo 12 to determine the output:
   - n ≡ 10 mod 12 → 2
   - n ≡ 11 mod 12 → 4
   - n ≡ 0 mod 12 → 3
   - else → 0

The problem is only defined for n=10,11,12 (as per the theorem statement), and in these cases:
- For n=10: 10%12=10 → 2 (correct)
- For n=11: 11%12=11 → 4 (correct)
- For n=12: 12%12=0 → 3 (correct)

However, the proposed answer makes claims about other values of n (through the modulo operation) that aren't part of the original problem's scope. While it's correct for the specified cases, it's extending the solution beyond what was asked.
