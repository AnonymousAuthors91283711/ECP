This problem involves finding the largest natural number `s` that can be expressed as a sum `x + y` where `x` and `y` are part of a sequence of 9 numbers with specific constraints. The sequence values must come from a fixed set, be injective, and satisfy certain recurrence relations.

We'll approach this by:
1. Enumerating all possible injective functions from Fin 9 to the given set {1,2,4,5,6,9,10,11,13}
2. Checking which functions satisfy the recurrence conditions
3. Tracking the maximum sum x + y (where x = f 0 and y = f 8)

```python
def main():
    values = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13}
    max_sum = 0
    
    # We'll iterate through all possible injective functions f: {0..8} -> values
    # Since the domain is size 9 and codomain is size 9, these are permutations
    from itertools import permutations
    
    for perm in permutations(values):
        f = perm  # f(0)=perm[0], f(1)=perm[1], etc.
        # Check recurrence conditions
        if (f[1] == f[0] + f[2] and
            f[3] == f[2] + f[4] and
            f[5] == f[4] + f[6] and
            f[7] == f[6] + f[8]):
            current_sum = f[0] + f[8]
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                print(f"New max sum found: {max_sum} with sequence {f}")
    
    print(f"Final maximum sum: {max_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
