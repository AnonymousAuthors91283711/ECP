Ground Truth Answer: 21
Proposed Answer: Nat.lcm (Nat.lcm 12 14) 15 / Nat.gcd 20 (Nat.lcm (Nat.lcm 12 14) 15)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n such that:
   - 12 divides 20n (from 12r = 20n)
   - 14 divides 20n (from 14g = 20n)
   - 15 divides 20n (from 15b = 20n)

2. This is equivalent to finding the least n such that 20n is a common multiple of 12, 14, and 15.

3. The ground truth answer is 21, which is correct because:
   - LCM of 12, 14, 15 is 420
   - We need 20n = 420k for smallest n
   - Smallest solution is when k=1: n = 420/gcd(20,420) = 420/20 = 21

4. The proposed answer calculates:
   - LCM(LCM(12,14),15)/GCD(20,LCM(LCM(12,14),15))
   - Which is exactly 420/20 = 21

The proposed answer is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth answer, just expressed in terms of LCM and GCD operations.
