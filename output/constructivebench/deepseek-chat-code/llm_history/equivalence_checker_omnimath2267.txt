Ground Truth Answer: 51
Proposed Answer: 63
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest number N representable as a sum of powers of 4 with coefficients d_i < 4, using up to 4^2012 (since range 2013 goes from 0 to 2012). The maximum such number is indeed 4^2013 - 1 (all d_i = 3).

2. The second part asks for (4^2013 - 1) mod 210. We need to compute this.

3. Breaking down 210 = 2×3×5×7, we can compute the modulus separately:
   - mod 2: 4^2013 - 1 ≡ 0 - 1 ≡ 1
   - mod 3: 4 ≡ 1 mod 3 ⇒ 1^2013 - 1 ≡ 0
   - mod 5: 4^2013 mod 5 cycles every 2 (4^1≡4, 4^2≡1) ⇒ 4^(2013 mod 2) - 1 ≡ 4^1 - 1 ≡ 3
   - mod 7: 4^2013 mod 7 cycles every 3 (4^1≡4, 4^2≡2, 4^3≡1) ⇒ 4^(2013 mod 3) - 1 ≡ 4^0 - 1 ≡ 0

4. Now we need a number ≡ (1,0,3,0) mod (2,3,5,7). The ground truth is 51, which satisfies:
   - 51 mod 2 = 1
   - 51 mod 3 = 0
   - 51 mod 5 = 1 (but we needed 3)
   - 51 mod 7 = 2 (but we needed 0)

5. The proposed answer is 63, which satisfies:
   - 63 mod 2 = 1
   - 63 mod 3 = 0
   - 63 mod 5 = 3
   - 63 mod 7 = 0

The proposed answer 63 correctly satisfies all the required congruences, while the ground truth 51 does not. Therefore, the proposed answer is actually correct, and the ground truth appears to be incorrect.
