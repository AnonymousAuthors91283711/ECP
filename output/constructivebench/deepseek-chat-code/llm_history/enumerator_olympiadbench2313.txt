This problem involves finding all integer pairs (a, b) such that the composition of two quadratic functions equals another quadratic function. We'll enumerate possible integer values for a and b that satisfy the equation for all x.

The approach is:
1. Expand the composition f(g(x)) where f(x) = x² - x + 2 and g(x) = a*x + b
2. Compare coefficients with the right side 9x² - 3x + 2
3. Solve the resulting system of equations for a and b

```python
def solve():
    # We'll check a in [-5,5] since a^2 must be 9
    for a in range(-5, 6):
        for b in range(-5, 6):
            # Coefficients from expanding (a*x + b)^2 - (a*x + b) + 2
            # = a^2*x^2 + (2ab - a)x + (b^2 - b + 2)
            # Must equal 9x^2 - 3x + 2
            if (a*a == 9 and                # x^2 coefficient
                2*a*b - a == -3 and         # x coefficient
                b*b - b + 2 == 2):          # constant term
                print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}")

    print("Enumerating all possible solutions...")
    # Now check all possible combinations systematically
    solutions = []
    for a in [-3, 3]:  # Only possible values since a^2 must be 9
        # Solve 2ab - a = -3 for each a
        # For a=3: 6b - 3 = -3 => 6b = 0 => b=0
        # For a=-3: -6b + 3 = -3 => -6b = -6 => b=1
        b1 = 0 if a == 3 else 1
        # Verify constant term
        if b1*b1 - b1 + 2 == 2:
            solutions.append((a, b1))
    
    print("All integer solutions:")
    for sol in solutions:
        print(sol)
