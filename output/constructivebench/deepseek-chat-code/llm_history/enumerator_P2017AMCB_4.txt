This problem involves finding a distance d where:
1. The first half of distance d is traveled at 17 km/h, taking time t₁
2. The second half is traveled at 5 km/h, taking time t₂
3. The total time t₁ + t₂ is 44 minutes (44/60 hours)
4. We need to find d/2 rounded to one decimal place

We'll solve the equation for d, then compute d/2 and round it. The program will calculate this directly since it's a simple algebraic problem.

```python
def solve():
    # Total time equation: (d/2)/17 + (d/2)/5 = 44/60
    # Let x = d/2, then x/17 + x/5 = 44/60
    # x(1/17 + 1/5) = 44/60
    # x(22/85) = 44/60
    # x = (44/60)/(22/85) = (44*85)/(60*22)
    x = (44 * 85) / (60 * 22)
    # Round x to one decimal place
    rounded_x = round(x * 10) / 10
    print(rounded_x)

solve()
