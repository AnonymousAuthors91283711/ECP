    (P_def : ∀ f, P f ↔ ∀ x y : ℝ, f (x ^ 2) + f (2 * y ^ 2) = (f (x + y) + f y) * (f (x - y) + f y)) :
    (∀ f, P f ↔ f ∈ omnimath4112_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Special solution: f(x) = x²
Special solution: f(x) = 0. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
<<<{f | ∃ c : ℝ, f = fun x => c * x^2} ∪ {fun _ => 0}>>>

Explanation: The enumerated solutions suggest quadratic functions (x²) and the zero function. The general solution appears to be all constant multiples of x² plus the zero function. The union accounts for both cases.
