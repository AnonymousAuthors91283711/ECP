Testing a = 1/2
No linear solutions found for this a

Testing a = 2
No linear solutions found for this a

Testing a = -1/3
No linear solutions found for this a

Testing a = 3/4
No linear solutions found for this a. Expected Answer Type: ℚ → Set (ℚ → ℚ)
Based on the problem statement and the enumeration results showing no linear solutions exist for various rational a ≠ 0, the correct answer appears to be the empty set for all a ≠ 0. The functional equation doesn't seem to have any solutions in the space of rational functions ℚ → ℚ.
