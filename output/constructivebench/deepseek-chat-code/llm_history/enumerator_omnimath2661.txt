[write_program]
This problem involves function composition and evaluation. We need to find the value of g(0) where g(x) = f(x) - 6 and f(x) = x + 4. The solution can be found by direct computation:

1. First compute f(0) = 0 + 4 = 4
2. Then compute g(0) = f(0) - 6 = 4 - 6 = -2

The program will compute and output this value directly since it's a straightforward calculation.

```python
def f(x):
    return x + 4

def g(x):
    return f(x) - 6

answer = g(0)
print(answer)
```
