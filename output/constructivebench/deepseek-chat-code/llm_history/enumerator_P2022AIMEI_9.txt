This problem involves calculating the probability that a random arrangement of 6 pairs of shoes in a row has all left shoes on the left side of all right shoes. We'll compute the total arrangements and the valid arrangements where left shoes are all to the left of right shoes.

The total arrangements is 12! / (2^6) since we have 6 pairs (indistinguishable within pairs). The valid arrangements require choosing positions for left shoes first (6! ways), then right shoes must go in remaining positions (another 6! ways), but since pairs are indistinct, we divide by 2^6. We'll compute this probability in reduced form.

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    # Total arrangements: 12! / (2^6)
    total = math.factorial(12) // (2**6)
    
    # Valid arrangements: 6! * 6! / (2^6)
    valid = math.factorial(6) * math.factorial(6) // (2**6)
    
    # Probability as fraction
    prob = Fraction(valid, total)
    
    # Simplify and print
    print(f"{prob.numerator}/{prob.denominator}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
