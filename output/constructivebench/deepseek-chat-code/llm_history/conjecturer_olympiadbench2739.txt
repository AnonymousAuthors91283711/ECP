. Enumerated Answers: Using r1 = 179.955544576196075, r2 = 0.044455423803925

Looking at the enumerated answers, we see the expression evaluates to approximately 508, not 30√3 (which is about 51.96). The error message suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable due to using Real.sqrt, but the main issue is the proposed answer doesn't match the numerical evidence.

From the problem statement, we have:
1. r₁ + r₂ = 180
2. r₁ * r₂ = 8

We can observe that the expression r₁/(r₂^(1/3)) + r₂/(r₁^(1/3)) can be rewritten as (r₁^(4/3) + r₂^(4/3))/(r₁r₂)^(1/3). Given r₁r₂ = 8, the denominator becomes 2.

The enumerated answers show the expression equals 508, which suggests the numerator (r₁^(4/3) + r₂^(4/3)) must be 1016. This leads us to the correct answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev olympiadbench2739_answer : ℝ := 508>>> 

The explanation is:
1. The numerical evaluation shows the expression equals ~508
2. The denominator simplifies to 2 since (r₁r₂)^(1/3) = 8^(1/3) = 2
3. Therefore the numerator must be 1016 to give final result 508
4. The answer is exact based on the numerical evidence from enumeration
