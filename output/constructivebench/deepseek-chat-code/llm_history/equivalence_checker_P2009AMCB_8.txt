theorem P2009AMCB_8 (a b : ℝ) :
  ∃ (w : ℝ) (c : ℝ), 
    (2/3 * c + w = a) ∧ 
    (1/2 * c + w = b) ∧ 
    (c + w = P2009AMCB_8_answer a b) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => 3 * a - 2 * b
Proposed Answer: fun a b => 4 * a - 6 * b
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

The problem presents a system of equations:
1. (2/3)c + w = a
2. (1/2)c + w = b
3. c + w = answer(a, b)

We need to solve for c and w in terms of a and b, then find c + w.

From equation 1 and 2:
(2/3)c + w = a
(1/2)c + w = b

Subtract equation 2 from 1:
(2/3 - 1/2)c = a - b
(1/6)c = a - b
c = 6(a - b)

Substitute c back into equation 2:
(1/2)*6(a - b) + w = b
3(a - b) + w = b
w = b - 3(a - b) = b - 3a + 3b = 4b - 3a

Now c + w = 6(a - b) + (4b - 3a) = 6a - 6b + 4b - 3a = 3a - 2b

The ground truth answer is correct: fun a b => 3 * a - 2 * b
The proposed answer is incorrect: fun a b => 4 * a - 6 * b
