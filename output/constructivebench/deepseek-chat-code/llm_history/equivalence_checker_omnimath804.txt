Ground Truth Answer: 106
Proposed Answer: 60 + 30 + 10 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is counting pairs (a,b) where:
   - 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 60
   - a divides b (b % a = 0)
   - a+1 divides b+1 ((b+1) % (a+1) = 0)

2. The ground truth answer is 106.

3. The proposed answer is a sum that equals:
   - 60 (from 60 ones) + 30 + 10 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + ... = much more than 106
   - The sum appears to be counting something different or incorrectly

4. The proposed answer is clearly much larger than the correct answer of 106.
