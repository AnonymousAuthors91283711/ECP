This problem is asking to find a function `omnimath3146_answer` such that for all real numbers x, `(x + 1)^2 - x^2 = omnimath3146_answer x`. We can algebraically simplify the left side to find the answer.

The algebraic simplification is:
(x + 1)^2 - x^2 
= (x^2 + 2x + 1) - x^2 
= 2x + 1

Therefore, the function should be `2x + 1`. We'll write a Python program that verifies this for several sample values of x to confirm our algebraic solution.

```python
def omnimath3146_answer(x):
    return 2 * x + 1

# Test the function with various real numbers
test_values = [-3.5, -1, 0, 0.5, 2, 4.25]
for x in test_values:
    left_side = (x + 1)**2 - x**2
    right_side = omnimath3146_answer(x)
    print(f"x = {x}: (x+1)^2 - x^2 = {left_side}, omnimath3146_answer(x) = {right_side}")
    assert abs(left_side - right_side) < 1e-9  # Floating point tolerance check

print("All test cases passed successfully.")
```
