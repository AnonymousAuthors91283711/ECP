This problem involves calculating the probability that a pair (c, p) satisfies certain conditions, where c and p range from 0 to 59. The condition is: if p=0 then c<360, else the concatenation of c and p must be less than 360. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all valid pairs and compute the probability.

The approach:
1. Iterate through all possible pairs (c, p) where c and p range from 0 to 59
2. For each pair, check if it satisfies the given condition
3. Count the valid pairs and compute the probability as valid_pairs/total_pairs (3600)
4. Output the probability as a reduced fraction

```python
import fractions

def is_valid(c, p):
    if p == 0:
        return c < 360
    else:
        concatenated = c * (10 ** len(str(p))) + p
        return concatenated < 360

def main():
    total_pairs = 60 * 60
    valid_count = 0
    
    for c in range(60):
        for p in range(60):
            if is_valid(c, p):
                valid_count += 1
    
    probability = fractions.Fraction(valid_count, total_pairs)
    print(f"Valid pairs: {valid_count}/{total_pairs} = {probability}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
