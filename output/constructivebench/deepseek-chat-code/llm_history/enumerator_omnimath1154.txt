[write_program]
This problem involves finding the minimum value of a function f(x,y) over a triangular region defined by 0 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1. The function f is defined as the maximum of three expressions involving x and y. We'll write a Python program to numerically explore this problem by sampling points in the region and evaluating f.

The approach will be:
1. Sample points in the triangular region with small increments
2. Evaluate f(x,y) at each point
3. Track the minimum value found
4. Output intermediate results and finally the minimal value found

```python
import math

def f(x, y):
    term1 = x * y
    term2 = 1 - x - y + x * y
    term3 = x + y - 2 * x * y
    return max(term1, term2, term3)

def find_min_f():
    min_val = float('inf')
    best_x, best_y = 0, 0
    
    # Sample points in the triangular region 0 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1
    steps = 1000  # Number of steps in each dimension
    for i in range(steps + 1):
        x = i / steps
        for j in range(i, steps + 1):  # Ensure y >= x
            y = j / steps
            current = f(x, y)
            if current < min_val:
                min_val = current
                best_x, best_y = x, y
                print(f"New minimum: {min_val:.6f} at (x,y)=({x:.4f},{y:.4f})")
    
    print(f"\nFinal minimum found: {min_val:.10f}")
    print(f"At point (x,y)=({best_x:.10f},{best_y:.10f})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_f()
```
