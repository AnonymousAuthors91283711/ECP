This problem involves solving for p given an equation, then computing a final expression. We'll:
1. Solve the equation (3p-q)-p = (3p+q)-(3p-q) for p
2. Substitute p and q=9 into the final expression
3. Compute the exact value

The program will:
1. Solve the equation symbolically to find p
2. Compute the final expression step by step
3. Output intermediate values and the final result

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve():
    q = Fraction(9, 1)
    # Solve (3p - q) - p = (3p + q) - (3p - q)
    # Simplifies to 2p - q = 2q
    # So 2p = 3q => p = 3q/2
    p = Fraction(3 * q, 2)
    
    term1 = 3*p + q
    term2 = (3*p + q) - (3*p - q)
    result = term1 + 2010 * term2
    
    print(f"p = {p}")
    print(f"3p + q = {term1}")
    print(f"(3p+q)-(3p-q) = {term2}")
    print(f"Final result = {result}")
