The problem involves calculating how many numbers in a given dataset are outliers based on the interquartile range (IQR) method. The dataset is provided, and we need to count values that fall below Q1 - 1.5*IQR or above Q3 + 1.5*IQR. The solution requires computing these bounds and counting the outliers.

Here's a Python program that calculates this:

```python
def count_outliers():
    data = [6, 19, 33, 33, 39, 41, 41, 43, 51, 57]
    Q1 = 33
    Q3 = 43
    IQR = Q3 - Q1
    lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
    upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
    
    outliers = [x for x in data if x < lower_bound or x > upper_bound]
    print("Outlier values found:", outliers)
    print("Number of outliers:", len(outliers))

count_outliers()
```

The program:
1. Defines the dataset and quartile values as given
2. Calculates IQR and outlier bounds
3. Filters and counts values outside these bounds
4. Prints both the outlier values and their count

The output will show the outlier values and their count, which is the answer to the problem. The program doesn't hardcode the answer but computes it from the given data.
