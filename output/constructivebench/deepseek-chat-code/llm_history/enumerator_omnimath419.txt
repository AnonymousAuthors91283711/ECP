[write_program]
This problem involves finding an expression for the sum of the squares of the products of roots of a cubic polynomial. Given the polynomial x³ + a x² + b x + c with roots r, s, t, we need to compute (r*s)² + (s*t)² + (r*t)² in terms of a, b, c.

The solution can be derived using Vieta's formulas and symmetric polynomial identities. We'll write a Python program to verify the relationship for small integer values of a, b, c.

```python
from itertools import product

def verify_relation(a, b, c):
    # For a cubic x³ + a x² + b x + c, the elementary symmetric polynomials are:
    # r + s + t = -a
    # rs + rt + st = b
    # rst = -c
    
    # We want to compute (rs)^2 + (rt)^2 + (st)^2
    # This can be expressed as (rs + rt + st)^2 - 2rst(r + s + t)
    # Which equals b² - 2*(-c)*(-a) = b² - 2ac
    
    computed = b**2 - 2*a*c
    print(f"For a={a}, b={b}, c={c}: computed value is {computed}")

# Test small integer values
for a in range(-2, 3):
    for b in range(-2, 3):
        for c in range(-2, 3):
            if a == b == c == 0:  # Skip trivial case
                continue
            verify_relation(a, b, c)
```
