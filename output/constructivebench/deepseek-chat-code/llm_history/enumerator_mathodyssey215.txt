[write_program]
This problem asks to find the real value(s) of x that satisfy the equation √(x² + 2x - 6) = √(x² - 14). We'll write a Python program to numerically search for solutions and verify them.

The approach is:
1. Square both sides to eliminate square roots
2. Solve the resulting equation algebraically
3. Verify solutions in the original equation (since squaring can introduce extraneous solutions)
4. Check domain restrictions (expressions under square roots must be non-negative)

```python
import math

def is_solution(x):
    # Check if both square roots are real and equation holds
    term1 = x**2 + 2*x - 6
    term2 = x**2 - 14
    if term1 < 0 or term2 < 0:
        return False
    return math.isclose(math.sqrt(term1), math.sqrt(term2))

def find_solutions():
    # Search around the algebraic solution x = 2
    step = 0.0001
    for x in [i * step for i in range(-10000, 10001)]:
        if is_solution(x):
            print(f"Found solution: x = {x}")

    # Also check the algebraic solution exactly
    x = 2.0
    if is_solution(x):
        print(f"Exact solution verified: x = {x}")

    # Check domain restrictions
    print("\nDomain analysis:")
    print(f"For x² + 2x - 6 ≥ 0: x ≤ {-1 - math.sqrt(7)} or x ≥ {-1 + math.sqrt(7)}")
    print(f"For x² - 14 ≥ 0: x ≤ {-math.sqrt(14)} or x ≥ {math.sqrt(14)}")

find_solutions()
```
