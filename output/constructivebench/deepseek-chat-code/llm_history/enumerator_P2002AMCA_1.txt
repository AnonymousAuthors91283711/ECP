This problem involves finding the sum of roots of a polynomial equation. The polynomial is given as (2x + 3)(x - 4) + (2x + 3)(x - 6). We need to expand this polynomial, find its roots, and calculate their sum.

The approach is:
1. Expand the polynomial expression
2. Find the roots of the resulting quadratic equation
3. Calculate the sum of roots using Vieta's formulas (sum of roots = -b/a for axÂ² + bx + c)

```python
from sympy import symbols, expand, roots

def solve_problem():
    x = symbols('x')
    # Define the polynomial expression
    poly = (2*x + 3)*(x - 4) + (2*x + 3)*(x - 6)
    # Expand the polynomial
    expanded_poly = expand(poly)
    print(f"Expanded polynomial: {expanded_poly}")
    
    # Find the roots
    root_dict = roots(expanded_poly)
    print(f"Roots: {root_dict}")
    
    # Calculate sum of roots
    sum_roots = sum(root * multiplicity for root, multiplicity in root_dict.items())
    print(f"Sum of roots: {sum_roots}")
    
    # Verify using Vieta's formula
    a = expanded_poly.coeff(x, 2)
    b = expanded_poly.coeff(x, 1)
    vieta_sum = -b/a
    print(f"Sum via Vieta's formula: {vieta_sum}")
