This problem involves solving a simple rational equation. The equation is `1/(2n) + 1/(4n) = 3/12`, and we need to find the value of `n` that satisfies it. The solution can be found by combining the fractions and solving for `n`.

Here's a Python program that verifies the solution by testing rational numbers and checking the equation:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve_equation():
    # The equation is 1/(2n) + 1/(4n) = 3/12
    # Let's simplify the right side first
    right_side = Fraction(3, 12)
    
    # We'll test n as fractions with denominators up to 10
    for denominator in range(1, 11):
        for numerator in range(1, 21):
            n = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
            left_side = Fraction(1, 2*n) + Fraction(1, 4*n)
            if left_side == right_side:
                print(f"Solution found: n = {n}")
                return
    
    print("No solution found in the tested range")
