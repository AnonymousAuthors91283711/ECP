This problem involves finding the largest n such that there exists a complete graph with n vertices where:
1. Edges are colored with 3 colors (0,1,2)
2. No vertex has all incident edges of the same color
3. All three colors appear in the graph
4. No monochromatic triangle exists

We'll write a Python program to enumerate small cases and find the maximum n satisfying these conditions.

```python
from itertools import product, combinations

def is_valid(n, edge_colors):
    # Check all conditions
    # 1. Symmetry
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j and edge_colors[i][j] != edge_colors[j][i]:
                return False
    
    # 2. No vertex has all incident edges of same color
    for i in range(n):
        colors = set()
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j:
                colors.add(edge_colors[i][j])
        if len(colors) < 2:  # All edges same color
            return False
    
    # 3. All three colors appear
    all_colors = set()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            all_colors.add(edge_colors[i][j])
    if len(all_colors) < 3:
        return False
    
    # 4. No monochromatic triangle
    for triangle in combinations(range(n), 3):
        a, b, c = triangle
        if (edge_colors[a][b] == edge_colors[a][c] == edge_colors[b][c]):
            return False
    
    return True

def enumerate_graphs(max_n=6):
    for n in range(3, max_n+1):
        print(f"Checking n = {n}")
        found = False
        # Generate all possible edge colorings (symmetric)
        # This is very inefficient but works for small n
        for coloring in product(range(3), repeat=n*(n-1)//2):
            # Build edge color matrix
            edge_colors = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]
            idx = 0
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(i+1, n):
                    edge_colors[i][j] = coloring[idx]
                    edge_colors[j][i] = coloring[idx]
                    idx += 1
            
            if is_valid(n, edge_colors):
                print(f"Found valid coloring for n={n}")
                found = True
                break  # Just need one example
        
        if not found:
            print(f"No valid coloring found for n={n}")
            return n-1
    return max_n

max_n = enumerate_graphs()
print(f"Maximum n found: {max_n}")
```

Note: This program uses brute-force enumeration which becomes impractical for n > 6 due to combinatorial explosion. For n=6, there are 3^15 possible colorings. The program demonstrates the approach but would need optimization for larger cases. The output will show the maximum n where a valid coloring exists before reporting failure for n+1.
