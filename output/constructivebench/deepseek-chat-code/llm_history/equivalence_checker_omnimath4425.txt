Ground Truth Answer: ∃ a b, 0 < a ∧ 0 < b ∧ a ≠ b ∧ 
  Infinite {n | 0 < n ∧ (a^n + b^n) ∣ (a^(n+1) + b^(n+1))}
Proposed Answer: ∃ k > 1, ∃ a > 0, a ≠ k * a ∧ Infinite {n | 0 < n ∧ (a^n + (k*a)^n) ∣ (a^(n+1) + (k*a)^(n+1))}

The proposed answer is mostly correct but has some issues:
1. It correctly captures the essence of the problem by suggesting pairs (a, k*a) where k>1
2. However, the condition "a ≠ k * a" is redundant since k>1 already implies a≠k*a (as a>0)
3. The ground truth is more general as it allows any a,b with a≠b, while the proposed answer restricts to pairs where b is a multiple of a

The proposed answer would work for many cases, but isn't fully equivalent to the ground truth.
