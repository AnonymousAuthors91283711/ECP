This problem involves counting the number of 4-tuples (a,b,c,d) where a,b,c,d ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6} (representing dice rolls) that satisfy the equation x² + a*x + b = x² + c*x + d for some x. The equation simplifies to (a-c)x + (b-d) = 0. We need to count all cases where this equation has at least one solution.

The Python program will enumerate all possible 4-tuples (a,b,c,d) with values from 1 to 6 and count those that satisfy either:
1. a ≠ c and x = (d-b)/(a-c) has a real solution (we don't need to check if x is integer since the problem allows any real x)
2. a = c and b = d (infinite solutions)

```python
def solve():
    count = 0
    total = 6**4
    for a in range(1, 7):
        for b in range(1, 7):
            for c in range(1, 7):
                for d in range(1, 7):
                    if a == c:
                        if b == d:
                            count += 1
                    else:
                        # Equation has exactly one solution (a ≠ c)
                        count += 1
    print(f"Count: {count}/{total} = {count/total}")

solve()
```
