theorem omnimath3925 (p n : ℕ) :
    (Nat.Prime p ∧ 0 < n ∧ (n^p + 1) % (p^n + 1) = 0) ↔ (p, n) ∈ omnimath3925_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for pairs (p, n) where:
- p is prime
- n > 0
- n^p + 1 divisible by p^n + 1
Searching p up to 20, n up to 20
Found pair: (2, 2)
Found pair: (2, 4)
