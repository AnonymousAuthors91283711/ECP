[write_program]
This problem involves solving a logarithmic equation. We'll write a Python program to find positive real x that satisfies the equation by testing values systematically.

The equation is: 2^(log(xÂ²)/log(10)) = 3*2^(1 + log(x)/log(10)) + 16

We'll approach this by:
1. Rewriting the equation in terms of y = log(x)/log(10)
2. Testing values of y systematically
3. Converting back to x values

```python
import math

def solve_equation():
    # We'll test y values in a reasonable range with small steps
    for y in range(-100, 100):
        y_val = y / 10.0  # Test with 0.1 precision
        lhs = 2 ** (2 * y_val)  # log(x^2)/log10 = 2*logx/log10
        rhs = 3 * 2 ** (1 + y_val) + 16
        
        # Check if values are approximately equal
        if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-6:
            x = 10 ** y_val
            print(f"Found solution: x = {x} (y = {y_val})")
    
    # After scanning, we can narrow down to more precise values
    # around the found solution for better accuracy
    for y in range(10, 30):
        y_val = y / 100.0  # Test with 0.01 precision
        lhs = 2 ** (2 * y_val)
        rhs = 3 * 2 ** (1 + y_val) + 16
        if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-8:
            x = 10 ** y_val
            print(f"Precise solution: x = {x} (y = {y_val})")
            return
    
    print("No solution found in tested range")
