This problem asks to find all positive integer pairs (x, y) such that 3^x * 5^y = 225, then determine x + y. We'll enumerate possible exponents by factoring 225 and checking combinations.

```python
def solve():
    target = 225
    max_exp = 10  # Reasonable upper bound for exponents
    
    # Factorize 225 to get max possible exponents
    factors = {}
    n = target
    for p in [3, 5]:
        count = 0
        while n % p == 0:
            count += 1
            n = n // p
        factors[p] = count
    
    # Enumerate possible exponent combinations
    solutions = []
    for x in range(1, factors.get(3, 0) + 1):
        for y in range(1, factors.get(5, 0) + 1):
            if (3**x) * (5**y) == target:
                solutions.append((x, y))
                print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}, sum={x+y}")
    
    if solutions:
        sums = [x + y for (x, y) in solutions]
        print(f"Possible sums: {sums}")
        print(f"Answer: {min(sums)}")  # Problem implies unique solution

solve()
```
