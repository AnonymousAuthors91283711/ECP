: Tendsto (fun x => ∏' n : ℕ, (((1 + x ^ (n + 1)) : ℝ) / (1 + x ^ n)) ^ (x ^ n)) (𝓝[<] 1) (𝓝[<] omnimath3144_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x = 0.90000, product ≈ 0.723891669203450
x = 0.99000, product ≈ 0.734624529599192
x = 0.99900, product ≈ 0.776925542288397
x = 0.99990, product ≈ 0.954644239927954
x = 0.99999, product ≈ 0.995049578287786

Final approximation with x = 0.999999: 0.995049622564514. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
