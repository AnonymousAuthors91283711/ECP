[write_program]
This problem is asking to find the value of `s` that satisfies the equation `4*s = 28`. The solution is straightforward algebra, but we'll write a Python program to verify it through enumeration (though enumeration isn't really necessary for such a simple equation).

The program will:
1. Solve the equation algebraically (s = 28/4)
2. Verify the solution by checking if 4*s equals 28
3. Print the verified solution

```python
def solve_equation():
    # Algebraic solution
    s = 28 / 4
    # Verification
    if 4 * s == 28:
        print(f"Solution found: s = {s}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_equation()
```
