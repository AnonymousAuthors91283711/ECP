[write_program]
This problem involves finding all pairs of natural numbers (x, y) that satisfy the equation:
3^x * 4^y = 2^(x + y) + 2^(2*(x + y) - 1)

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible (x, y) pairs up to a reasonable threshold (say 20) to find all solutions. The program will check both sides of the equation for each pair and print matches.

```python
def main():
    max_n = 20  # Reasonable upper bound for x and y
    print("Searching for (x, y) pairs satisfying:")
    print("3^x * 4^y == 2^(x+y) + 2^(2*(x+y)-1)")
    print(f"Checking x and y up to {max_n}...\n")
    
    found = []
    for x in range(0, max_n + 1):
        for y in range(0, max_n + 1):
            lhs = (3 ** x) * (4 ** y)
            exponent = x + y
            rhs = (2 ** exponent) + (2 ** (2 * exponent - 1))
            
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"Found solution: ({x}, {y})")
                found.append((x, y))
    
    print("\nAll solutions found:")
    for sol in found:
        print(sol)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
