The problem asks to count all 4-digit numbers (1000 to 9999) where for every consecutive pair of digits, if the first digit is odd then it must be less than the next digit, and if it's even then it must be greater than the next digit.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such numbers by:
1. Iterating through all 4-digit numbers
2. For each number, checking the condition for each consecutive digit pair
3. Counting valid numbers and printing them as found

```python
def is_valid(n):
    digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]
    for i in range(3):
        d1, d2 = digits[i], digits[i+1]
        if (d1 % 2 == 1 and d1 >= d2) or (d1 % 2 == 0 and d1 <= d2):
            return False
    return True

count = 0
for n in range(1000, 10000):
    if is_valid(n):
        count += 1
        print(n)  # Stream partial results

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
