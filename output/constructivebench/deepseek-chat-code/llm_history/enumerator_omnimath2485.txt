This problem involves solving a system of linear equations with 4 variables (w, x, y, z) and 4 equations, then finding the value of a 5th equation. We'll solve it by setting up the system and using matrix operations.

The approach:
1. Set up the coefficient matrix and constant vector for the first 4 equations
2. Solve the system to find w, x, y, z
3. Use these values to compute the 5th equation's value

```python
import numpy as np

def solve_system():
    # Coefficients matrix for first 4 equations
    A = np.array([
        [1, 1, 1, 1],
        [2, 4, 8, 16],
        [3, 9, 27, 81],
        [4, 16, 64, 256]
    ])
    
    # Constants vector
    b = np.array([5, 7, 11, 1])
    
    try:
        # Solve the system
        solution = np.linalg.solve(A, b)
        w, x, y, z = solution
        
        # Compute the 5th equation's value
        result = 5*w + 25*x + 125*y + 625*z
        
        print(f"Solution: w={w}, x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")
        print(f"5th equation value: {result}")
        
        # Return exact fractions if possible
        from fractions import Fraction
        exact_result = Fraction(5,1)*Fraction(w).limit_denominator() + \
                      Fraction(25,1)*Fraction(x).limit_denominator() + \
                      Fraction(125,1)*Fraction(y).limit_denominator() + \
                      Fraction(625,1)*Fraction(z).limit_denominator()
        print(f"Exact value: {exact_result}")
        
    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
        print("System has no unique solution")
