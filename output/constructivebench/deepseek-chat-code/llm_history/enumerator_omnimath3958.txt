[write_program]
This problem asks for all real quadruples (a,b,c,d) that satisfy three symmetric equations involving sums and sums of squares. To enumerate possible solutions, we'll consider small integer values and symmetric cases that might satisfy the equations.

The program will:
1. Iterate through small integer values for a, b, c, d
2. Check all three equations for each combination
3. Print valid solutions as they're found
4. Focus on symmetric cases which are likely candidates

```python
def check_equation(a, b, c, d):
    eq1 = (a + b) * (a**2 + b**2) == (c + d) * (c**2 + d**2)
    eq2 = (a + c) * (a**2 + c**2) == (b + d) * (b**2 + d**2)
    eq3 = (a + d) * (a**2 + d**2) == (b + c) * (b**2 + c**2)
    return eq1 and eq2 and eq3

def enumerate_solutions():
    # Check range -5 to 5 for small integer solutions
    for a in range(-5, 6):
        for b in range(-5, 6):
            for c in range(-5, 6):
                for d in range(-5, 6):
                    if check_equation(a, b, c, d):
                        print(f"Solution found: ({a}, {b}, {c}, {d})")
    
    # Check symmetric cases with floating point numbers
    for x in range(1, 6):
        a, b, c, d = x, x, x, x  # All equal case
        if check_equation(a, b, c, d):
            print(f"Symmetric solution: ({a}, {b}, {c}, {d})")
        
        a, b, c, d = x, -x, x, -x  # Alternating signs
        if check_equation(a, b, c, d):
            print(f"Symmetric solution: ({a}, {b}, {c}, {d})")
        
        a, b, c, d = x, x, -x, -x  # Two pairs
        if check_equation(a, b, c, d):
            print(f"Symmetric solution: ({a}, {b}, {c}, {d})")
    
    print("Enumeration complete")
