This problem involves finding the value of x₂*(x₁ + x₃) given a cubic polynomial with specific roots. We'll approach it by:
1. Expanding the polynomial form (x-x₁)(x-x₂)(x-x₃)
2. Comparing coefficients with the given polynomial √2014 x³ - 4029 x² + 2
3. Deriving relationships between the roots
4. Calculating the required expression x₂*(x₁ + x₃)

We'll use Vieta's formulas which relate polynomial coefficients to sums/products of roots.

```python
import math

def solve():
    sqrt_2014 = math.sqrt(2014)
    
    # From Vieta's formulas for the polynomial √2014 x³ - 4029 x² + 0x + 2:
    # x₁ + x₂ + x₃ = 4029/√2014
    # x₁x₂ + x₁x₃ + x₂x₃ = 0
    # x₁x₂x₃ = -2/√2014
    
    # We need to find x₂*(x₁ + x₃)
    # From x₁ + x₂ + x₃ = S, we have x₁ + x₃ = S - x₂
    # So x₂*(x₁ + x₃) = x₂*(S - x₂) = S*x₂ - x₂²
    
    # From x₁x₂ + x₁x₃ + x₂x₃ = 0, we can write:
    # x₂(x₁ + x₃) + x₁x₃ = 0
    # But x₁x₃ = P/x₂ where P = x₁x₂x₃
    # So S*x₂ - x₂² + P/x₂ = 0
    # Multiply by x₂: S*x₂² - x₂³ + P = 0
    # Rearrange: x₂³ - S*x₂² - P = 0
    
    S = 4029 / sqrt_2014
    P = -2 / sqrt_2014
    
    # The equation for x₂ is x₂³ - S*x₂² - P = 0
    # We can verify that x₂ = 2/√2014 is a root:
    x2_candidate = 2 / sqrt_2014
    verification = x2_candidate**3 - S*x2_candidate**2 - P
    if abs(verification) < 1e-10:  # Check if close to zero
        result = x2_candidate * (S - x2_candidate)
        print(result)
    
solve()

Judgement:
The original program attempts to solve the problem by verifying a candidate root for x₂ and computing the required expression x₂*(x₁ + x₃). However, it fails to output any result because the verification condition is not met (likely due to floating-point precision issues). The program should instead:
1. Use exact rational arithmetic where possible to avoid precision problems
2. Properly handle the verification of the root
3. Output the exact value rather than relying on floating-point approximation

The program is rejected because it doesn't produce any output and doesn't properly handle the mathematical verification.

<<<False>>>

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def solve():
    # Using exact fractions to avoid floating point errors
    sqrt_2014_squared = 2014
    S = Fraction(4029, 1) / Fraction(int(math.sqrt(2014)), 1)
    P = Fraction(-2, 1) / Fraction(int(math.sqrt(2014)), 1)
    
    # The candidate x₂ = 2/√2014
    x2_candidate = Fraction(2, 1) / Fraction(int(math.sqrt(2014)), 1)
    
    # Verify the candidate satisfies x₂³ - S*x₂² - P = 0
    # Compute left hand side symbolically
    term1 = x2_candidate ** 3
    term2 = -S * x2_candidate ** 2
    term3 = -P
    verification = term1 + term2 + term3
    
    # Since we're using exact fractions, verification should be exactly 0
    if verification == 0:
        result = x2_candidate * (S - x2_candidate)
        # Simplify the result
        simplified = result.numerator / result.denominator
        print(float(simplified))  # Output as float for readability

Judgement:
The original program is rejected because:
1. It fails to produce any output (empty result) due to incorrect mathematical operations and verification.
2. It uses `int(math.sqrt(2014))` which truncates the square root to an integer, losing precision needed for exact calculations.
3. The verification logic is flawed because it doesn't properly handle the exact polynomial relationship.
4. The program doesn't follow the streaming partial results requirement.

The corrected program should:
1. Use exact symbolic calculations (via SymPy) to handle the irrational √2014 properly
2. Find all three roots of the polynomial
3. Identify the middle root x₂
4. Calculate x₂*(x₁ + x₃) using Vieta's formulas
5. Output the exact simplified result

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, sqrt, simplify

def solve_problem():
    x = symbols('x')
    # Define the polynomial equation: √2014 x³ - 4029 x² + 2 = 0
    equation = Eq(sqrt(2014) * x**3 - 4029 * x**2 + 2, 0)
    
    # Find all three real roots
    roots = solve(equation, x)
    real_roots = [r for r in roots if r.is_real]
    real_roots_sorted = sorted(real_roots)
    
    # Extract the middle root x₂
    x2 = real_roots_sorted[1]
    
    # Calculate x₂*(x₁ + x₃) using Vieta's formula (x₁ + x₂ + x₃ = 4029/√2014)
    sum_roots = 4029 / sqrt(2014)  # From Vieta's formula for sum of roots
    result = x2 * (sum_roots - x2)
    
    # Simplify and print the exact result
    simplified_result = simplify(result)
    print(float(simplified_result))  # Output as float for readability
