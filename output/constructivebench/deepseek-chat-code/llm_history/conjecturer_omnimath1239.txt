open Polynomial

abbrev omnimath1239_answer : ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath1239 (a b c : ℤ) :
    gcd (X^2 + C a * X + C b) (X^2 + C b * X + C c) = X + C 1 ∧
    lcm (X^2 + C a * X + C b) (X^2 + C b * X + C c) = X^3 - C 4 * X^2 + X + C 6
    ↔ a + b + c = omnimath1239_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No solution found in search range

. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
Based on the problem statement and the condition that the GCD is X + C 1 and LCM is X³ - 4X² + X + 6, we can deduce that the polynomials must be (X+1)(X+2) and (X+1)(X-3). This gives us coefficients a=3, b=2, c=-3, making a+b+c=2.
