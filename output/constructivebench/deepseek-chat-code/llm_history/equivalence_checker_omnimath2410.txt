Ground Truth Answer: 83/80
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives trigonometric relationships between angles and sides of a triangle (A,B,C are angles; AB,AC,BC are opposite sides respectively).

2. The ground truth answer is a specific fraction (83/80 ≈ 1.0375).

3. The proposed answer is simply 2.

4. The trigonometric identities given (h₁, h₂, h₃) suggest specific relationships that would typically lead to a more complex solution than just 2.

5. The proposed answer of 2 seems too simplistic given the complexity of the problem and doesn't match the ground truth answer of 83/80.

6. There's no obvious simplification or special case that would reduce the expression to exactly 2.
