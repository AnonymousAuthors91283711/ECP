[write_program]
This problem involves counting equal adjacent pairs in a string generated by iteratively applying replacement rules to an initial string. The rules are:
- 'A' → 'AB'
- 'B' → 'BA'

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Implement the string generation rules
2. Count adjacent equal pairs
3. Enumerate results for iterations up to n=10

```python
def apply_rule(s):
    """Apply replacement rules to each character in string s"""
    return ''.join(['AB' if c == 'A' else 'BA' for c in s])

def count_equal_pairs(s):
    """Count number of adjacent equal character pairs"""
    return sum(1 for a, b in zip(s, s[1:]) if a == b)

def main():
    current = 'A'
    for n in range(11):  # 0 to 10 iterations
        pairs = count_equal_pairs(current)
        print(f"Iteration {n}: Length={len(current)}, Equal pairs={pairs}")
        if n < 10:
            current = apply_rule(current)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
