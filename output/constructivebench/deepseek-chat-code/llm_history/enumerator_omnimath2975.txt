This problem involves calculating the probability that the sum of two independent random variables (Ben's and Jamie's outcomes) equals 50. We'll enumerate all possible outcome pairs and count the favorable ones where the sum is exactly 50.

```python
def main():
    ben_outcomes = [5, 10, 20]
    jamie_outcomes = [30, 40]
    total_outcomes = len(ben_outcomes) * len(jamie_outcomes)
    favorable = 0
    
    for b in ben_outcomes:
        for j in jamie_outcomes:
            if b + j == 50:
                favorable += 1
                print(f"Found favorable pair: ({b}, {j})")
    
    probability = f"{favorable}/{total_outcomes}"
    print(f"\nProbability = {probability}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
