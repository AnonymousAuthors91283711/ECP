This problem involves calculating the probability that a randomly selected positive divisor of 60 is less than 7. We need to:
1. Find all positive divisors of 60
2. Count how many divisors are less than 7
3. Compute the probability as (count of favorable divisors)/(total divisors)

Here's a Python program to enumerate all divisors of 60, count the favorable ones, and compute the probability:

```python
def find_divisors(n):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(n // i)
    return sorted(divisors)

def main():
    n = 60
    divisors = find_divisors(n)
    favorable = [d for d in divisors if d < 7]
    
    print(f"All divisors of {n}: {divisors}")
    print(f"Divisors < 7: {favorable}")
    print(f"Probability: {len(favorable)}/{len(divisors)} = {len(favorable)/len(divisors)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
