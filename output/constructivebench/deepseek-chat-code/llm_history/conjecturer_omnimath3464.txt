abbrev omnimath3464_answer : ℤ → ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath3464 (n : ℤ) : Odd (omnimath3464_answer n) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Function 2n+1 passed all tests in range -5 to 5
Function n²+1 failed at n=-5: result=26
Function n³ failed at n=-4: result=-64
Function |n|+1 failed at n=-5: result=6
Function (n+1)²-n passed all tests in range -5 to 5
Function constant 5 passed all tests in range -5 to 5
Function n|1 (bitwise OR with 1) passed all tests in range -5 to 5. Expected Answer Type: ℤ → ℤ
<<<fun n : ℤ => 2 * n + 1>>>
