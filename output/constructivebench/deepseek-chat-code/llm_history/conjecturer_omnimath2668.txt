abbrev omnimath2668_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2668
    (a b : ℝ)
    (habavg : (5 + a + b) / 3 = 33) :
    (a + b) / 2 = omnimath2668_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: For a=0, b=94:
(5+a+b)/3 = 33.0 (should be 33)
(a+b)/2 = 47.0

For a=47, b=47:
(5+a+b)/3 = 33.0 (should be 33)
(a+b)/2 = 47.0

For a=10, b=84:
(5+a+b)/3 = 33.0 (should be 33)
(a+b)/2 = 47.0

For a=-5, b=99:
(5+a+b)/3 = 33.0 (should be 33)
(a+b)/2 = 47.0
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<47>>>
