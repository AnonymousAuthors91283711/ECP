This problem involves finding all complex numbers `s` that can be expressed as `1/(1-r)` where `r` is a root of `r^2013 = 1/2013^2013`. To enumerate solutions, we'll:

1. Find all roots of the equation r^2013 = 1/2013^2013
2. For each root r, compute s = 1/(1-r)
3. Output the distinct s values

Since 2013 is large, we'll demonstrate with smaller exponents first to observe patterns.

```python
import cmath

def enumerate_solutions(n):
    print(f"Solutions for n = {n}:")
    # Find all roots of r^n = 1/(n^n)
    base = 1.0 / (n ** n)
    roots = [cmath.exp((2j * cmath.pi * k)/n) * (base ** (1.0/n)) for k in range(n)]
    
    # Compute s values
    s_values = [1.0/(1.0 - r) for r in roots]
    
    # Print distinct s values (using rounding to handle floating point precision)
    seen = set()
    for s in s_values:
        rounded = complex(round(s.real, 10), round(s.imag, 10))
        if rounded not in seen:
            seen.add(rounded)
            print(rounded)

# Test with small exponents to observe patterns
for n in [2, 3, 4]:
    enumerate_solutions(n)
    print()

# For the original problem (n=2013), we'd do:
# enumerate_solutions(2013)
# But this would produce too much output, so we omit it
```
