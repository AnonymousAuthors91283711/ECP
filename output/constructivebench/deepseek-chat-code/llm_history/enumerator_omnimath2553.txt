[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of 3-element subsets of an 8Ã—8 chessboard where any two distinct queens in the subset don't attack each other (i.e., they don't share a row, column, or diagonal). We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such subsets.

The approach:
1. Represent positions as (row, column) pairs from 0 to 7
2. Generate all possible 3-element combinations
3. Check if any two queens attack each other
4. Count the valid configurations

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_valid_triple(q1, q2, q3):
    """Check if no two queens attack each other in the triple."""
    def attacks(a, b):
        return (a[0] == b[0] or  # same row
                a[1] == b[1] or  # same column
                abs(a[0] - b[0]) == abs(a[1] - b[1]))  # same diagonal
    
    return not (attacks(q1, q2) or attacks(q1, q3) or attacks(q2, q3))

def count_non_attacking_triples():
    count = 0
    positions = [(r, c) for r in range(8) for c in range(8)]
    
    for triple in combinations(positions, 3):
        if is_valid_triple(*triple):
            count += 1
            print(triple)  # Print each valid triple
    
    print(f"Total non-attacking triples: {count}")

count_non_attacking_triples()
```
