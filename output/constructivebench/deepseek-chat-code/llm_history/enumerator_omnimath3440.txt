The problem asks for the minimal absolute difference between 1 and any number in the given set. We need to enumerate the absolute differences for each element in the set and find the smallest one.

```python
def main():
    numbers = [11/10, 111/100, 1.101, 1111/1000, 1.011]
    min_diff = float('inf')
    
    for x in numbers:
        diff = abs(x - 1)
        print(f"|{x} - 1| = {diff}")
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    
    print(f"\nMinimum difference: {min_diff}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
