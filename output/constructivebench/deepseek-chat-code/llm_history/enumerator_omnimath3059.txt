[write_program]
The problem is to compute the sum of the first 9 multiples of 5 (from 5×1 to 5×9). This is a straightforward arithmetic series sum that can be calculated directly. The program will compute this sum by iterating through the numbers 1 to 9, multiplying each by 5, and accumulating the total.

```python
# Compute the sum of 5*i for i from 1 to 9
total = 0
for i in range(1, 10):
    total += 5 * i
    print(f"Adding 5*{i} = {5*i}, current sum: {total}")
print(f"Final sum: {total}")
```
