theorem P2007AMCB_15 (a r : ℝ) (hr : ‖r‖ < 1) :
  (∑' n : ℕ, a * r ^ n = 7) ∧ 
  (∑' k : ℕ, a * r ^ (2 * k + 1) = 3) ↔ 
  P2007AMCB_15_answer (a, r) = 5/2 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found solution: a = 7/4, r = 3/4
a*r² = 63/64
Found solution: a = 7/4, r = 3/4
a*r² = 63/64. Expected Answer Type: ℝ × ℝ → ℝ
<<<fun ⟨a, r⟩ => a * r ^ 2>>>
