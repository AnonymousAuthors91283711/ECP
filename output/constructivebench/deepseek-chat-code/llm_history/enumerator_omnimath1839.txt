This problem involves calculating the expected value of a certain property over all bijective functions (permutations) of 10 elements where no element maps to 0. The property X counts how many positions i satisfy either f(i)-f(i+1)≥2 or f(i)-f(i-1)≥2 (with wrap-around).

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Generate all permutations of [1..10] (since 0 is excluded)
2. For each permutation, count positions satisfying the condition
3. Calculate the average count across all permutations

```python
from itertools import permutations
from math import factorial

n = 10
elements = range(1, n+1)  # Using 1..10 since 0 is excluded
total = 0
count = 0

for perm in permutations(elements):
    x_count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        current = perm[i]
        next_val = perm[(i+1)%n]
        prev_val = perm[(i-1)%n]
        if (current - next_val >= 2) or (current - prev_val >= 2):
            x_count += 1
    total += x_count
    count += 1
    # Print progress every 100000 permutations to show it's working
    if count % 100000 == 0:
        print(f"Processed {count} permutations, current average: {total/count:.6f}")

# Final result
print(f"Final average: {total/factorial(n)}")
```

Note: This program will take a very long time to run since 10! = 3,628,800 permutations. For practical testing, you might want to reduce n to smaller values first (like n=4 or n=5) to verify the logic works before attempting n=10. The program prints progress updates to show it's working.

The exact mathematical answer would require combinatorial analysis rather than brute-force enumeration, but this program helps verify conjectures for small cases.
