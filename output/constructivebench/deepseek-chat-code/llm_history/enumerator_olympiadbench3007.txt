[write_program]
This problem involves computing the product of modified digit products for numbers from 1 to 2019, where digits 0 and 5 are replaced by 1, then finding the result modulo 1000. We'll write a Python program to compute this efficiently.

Key optimizations:
1. Precompute digit products with 0/5 replaced by 1
2. Use modular arithmetic to keep numbers small (mod 1000 at each step)
3. Process numbers sequentially

```python
def modified_digit_product(n):
    product = 1
    while n > 0:
        d = n % 10
        if d == 0 or d == 5:
            product *= 1
        else:
            product *= d
        n = n // 10
    return product

def compute_product_mod():
    mod = 1000
    result = 1
    for n in range(1, 2020):
        mdp = modified_digit_product(n)
        result = (result * mdp) % mod
        # Print intermediate results every 100 numbers for observation
        if n % 100 == 0:
            print(f"Progress: n={n}, current mod={result}")
    return result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    final_result = compute_product_mod()
    print(f"Final result modulo 1000: {final_result}")
```
