: {f : ℝ → ℝ | (∀ x > 0, ∀ y > 0, f (x + f y) = f (x + y) + f y) ∧ ∀ y > 0, f y > 0} = omnimath4082_answer ↔ (∀ f : ℝ → ℝ, (∀ x > 0, ∀ y > 0, f (x + f y) = f (x + y) + f y) ∧ ∀ y > 0, f y > 0 → f ∈ omnimath4082_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing linear functions f(y) = k*y:
Found solution: f(y) = 2.0*y

Testing power functions f(y) = y^k:

Testing constant functions (should find none valid):

After testing common forms, the only solutions found were linear functions.. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
<<<{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ k > 0, ∀ x, f x = k * x}>>>
