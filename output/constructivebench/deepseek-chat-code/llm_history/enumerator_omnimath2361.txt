[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of positive divisors of 12! that are congruent to 1 modulo 3. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such divisors by:
1. First computing the prime factorization of 12!
2. Generating all possible divisors from the exponents
3. Counting those ≡1 mod3

The key insight is that for a divisor d ≡1 mod3, the sum of exponents of primes ≡2 mod3 must be even (by quadratic reciprocity).

```python
import math
from collections import defaultdict
from itertools import product

def factorize(n):
    factors = defaultdict(int)
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors[2] += 1
        n //= 2
    i = 3
    while i * i <= n:
        while n % i == 0:
            factors[i] += 1
            n //= i
        i += 2
    if n > 1:
        factors[n] += 1
    return factors

def count_divisors():
    n = math.factorial(12)
    factors = factorize(n)
    
    # Group primes by their residue mod 3
    primes_mod3 = {1: [], 2: []}
    for p in factors:
        if p % 3 == 1:
            primes_mod3[1].append(p)
        elif p % 3 == 2:
            primes_mod3[2].append(p)
    
    # For primes ≡1 mod3, exponents can be anything
    # For primes ≡2 mod3, sum of exponents must be even
    count = 0
    
    # Generate all possible exponent combinations for primes ≡2 mod3 with even sum
    primes_2 = primes_mod3[2]
    exponents_2 = [range(factors[p] + 1) for p in primes_2]
    for exp_combo in product(*exponents_2):
        if sum(exp_combo) % 2 == 0:
            # For each valid combination, multiply by all possible combinations of primes ≡1 mod3
            primes_1 = primes_mod3[1]
            exponents_1 = [range(factors[p] + 1) for p in primes_1]
            count += len(list(product(*exponents_1)))
    
    print(count)

count_divisors()
```
