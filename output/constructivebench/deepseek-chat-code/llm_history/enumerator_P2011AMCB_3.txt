[write_program]
This problem is asking to find the unique real number x that satisfies the equation A + x = B - x, given A < B. The solution can be derived algebraically by solving for x, but we'll write a Python program to verify this by testing various values of A and B.

The algebraic solution is straightforward:
A + x = B - x
=> 2x = B - A
=> x = (B - A)/2

The program will test small integer values for A and B (with A < B) and print the computed x values to verify they match the algebraic solution.

```python
def enumerate_solutions():
    # Test small integer values for A and B where A < B
    test_cases = [
        (0, 2),
        (1, 3),
        (-1, 1),
        (5, 10),
        (-3, 4)
    ]
    
    for A, B in test_cases:
        x = (B - A) / 2
        print(f"For A={A}, B={B}: x = {x}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_solutions()
```
