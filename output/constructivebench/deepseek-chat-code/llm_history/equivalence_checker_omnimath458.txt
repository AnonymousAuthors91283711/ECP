Ground Truth Answer: 982982
Proposed Answer: 491 * 491 * 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a number (omnimath458_answer) that is:
   - A 6-digit number formed as 100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C where A,B,C < 10
   - Equal to 491 * (100*A + 10*B + C) * 2
   - Where 491 is prime and (100*A + 10*B + C) is prime

2. Ground truth answer is 982982
   - This equals 491 * 1001 * 2
   - 1001 is 100*9 + 10*8 + 2 (A=9, B=8, C=2)
   - 1001 is not prime (7*11*13), which contradicts the problem's conditions

3. Proposed answer is 491 * 491 * 2 = 482162
   - This would require 100*A + 10*B + C = 491
   - But A,B,C must be <10, so maximum 3-digit number is 999
   - 491 is a valid prime, but the formed number would be 100100*4 + 10010*9 + 1001*1 = 400400 + 90090 + 1001 = 491491
   - 491491 * 2 = 982982 (the ground truth answer)

The ground truth answer appears to violate the problem's conditions (1001 isn't prime), while the proposed answer doesn't match the required form. Both answers seem problematic.
