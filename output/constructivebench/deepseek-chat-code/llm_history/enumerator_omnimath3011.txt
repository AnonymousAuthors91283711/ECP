This problem is about finding the value of g given that the average of three numbers a, f, g is 22, with a=23 and f=24. The solution involves simple arithmetic to solve for g.

We'll write a Python program that:
1. Shows the given conditions (a=23, f=24, average=22)
2. Calculates the required value of g using the average formula
3. Outputs the solution

```python
# Given conditions
a = 23
f = 24
average = 22

# Calculate g using the average formula: (a + f + g)/3 = average
g = 3 * average - a - f

# Output the solution
print(f"Given a={a}, f={f}, and average={average}, the required value of g is: {g}")
```
