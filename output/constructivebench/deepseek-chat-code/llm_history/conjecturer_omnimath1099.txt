From the problem statement and error message, I can see:
1. The theorem is trying to establish two equalities about probabilities
2. The error is just a syntax issue with line breaks in the `let` declarations
3. The enumerated answer shows the exact value is 677283/1048576
4. The proposed answer 1 - (13/16)^5 is mathematically correct but needs proper Lean syntax

The key observations:
- p = (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16
- q = 1 - p = 13/16
- The theorem states q^5 = (13/16)^5 and 1 - q^5 equals our answer
- 1 - (13/16)^5 is indeed 677283/1048576 when calculated

The fix needs to:
1. Keep the exact value rather than the expression
2. Use proper Lean real number syntax

Here's the corrected answer:

From the problem statement and error message, I can see that:
1. The theorem is trying to establish two equalities about q^5 and 1-q^5
2. The error is just a syntax issue with line breaks in the let bindings
3. The enumerated answer shows the exact probability is 677283/1048576

The key observation is that:
- p = (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16
- q = 1 - p = 13/16
- Therefore 1 - q^5 = 1 - (13/16)^5 = 677283/1048576
