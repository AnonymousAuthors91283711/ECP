abbrev omnimath3014_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3014 : omnimath3014_answer = 333/1000 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 3/10 + 3/100 + 3/1000
Proposed Answer: 1/3 + 1/100
Let's analyze the equivalence:

1. Ground Truth Answer: 3/10 + 3/100 + 3/1000 = 300/1000 + 30/1000 + 3/1000 = 333/1000
2. Proposed Answer: 1/3 + 1/100 ≈ 0.3333 + 0.01 = 0.3433 ≠ 0.333

The exact value of 1/3 is 0.333..., so 1/3 + 1/100 = 333/1000 + 10/1000 = 343/1000 ≠ 333/1000.

<<<False>>>
