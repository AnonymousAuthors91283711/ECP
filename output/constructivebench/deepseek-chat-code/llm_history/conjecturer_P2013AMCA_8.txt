  x * y = P2013AMCA_8_answer x y := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x=7.615, y=0.263, product xy=2.000
x=3.667, y=0.545, product xy=2.000
x=0.605, y=3.308, product xy=2.000
x=8.813, y=0.227, product xy=2.000
x=6.283, y=0.318, product xy=2.000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
From the enumerated answers, we observe that the product x*y is consistently 2.0 across all valid pairs (x,y) satisfying the given equation. The pattern suggests the product is constant regardless of the specific values of x and y (as long as they satisfy the conditions).
