Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => 2 * x + y + 2015
Proposed Answer: fun x y => 336 * (x + y) + (if x + y = 3 then 2 else 0)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence a(n) with base cases a(1)=x and a(3)=y, and a recurrence relation for n>1. We need to find the sum of the first 2018 terms.

2. The ground truth answer is a simple linear function of x and y: 2*x + y + 2015.

3. The proposed answer is much more complex, involving multiplication by 336 and a conditional check.

Key observations:
- The recurrence relation suggests the sequence should have a linear behavior
- The ground truth answer is consistent with what we'd expect from such a recurrence
- The proposed answer's complexity doesn't match the problem's nature
- The numbers 336 and 3 in the proposed answer don't relate to 2018 in the problem

The answers are clearly not equivalent, and the proposed answer doesn't make sense for this problem.
