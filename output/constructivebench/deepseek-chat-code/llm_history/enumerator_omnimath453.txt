[write_program]
This problem involves counting the number of ways to place 51 non-attacking "quaggas" on an 8x8 chessboard, where quaggas move in specific L-shaped patterns. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible configurations for smaller board sizes and smaller numbers of pieces to help identify the pattern.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_quagga_move(p1, p2):
    x1, y1 = p1
    x2, y2 = p2
    return (abs(x1 - x2) == 6 and abs(y1 - y2) == 5) or \
           (abs(x1 - x2) == 5 and abs(y1 - y2) == 6)

def count_non_attacking(n, k, size=8):
    """Count non-attacking quagga configurations of size k on size x size board."""
    board = [(x, y) for x in range(size) for y in range(size)]
    count = 0
    
    for subset in combinations(board, k):
        valid = True
        for i in range(len(subset)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(subset)):
                if is_quagga_move(subset[i], subset[j]):
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1
            print(f"Found configuration {count}: {subset}")  # Stream partial results
    
    print(f"Total non-attacking quagga configurations for n={n}, k={k}: {count}")
    return count

# Test smaller cases to identify pattern
print("Testing smaller cases:")
count_non_attacking(4, 2, 4)  # 2x2 board would be too trivial
count_non_attacking(5, 2, 5)
count_non_attacking(6, 3, 6)
```
