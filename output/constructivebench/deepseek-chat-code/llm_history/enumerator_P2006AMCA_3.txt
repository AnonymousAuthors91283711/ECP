The problem is to find Mary's age given that Alice is 30 years old and the ratio of Mary's age to Alice's age is 3/5. This translates to solving for Mary's age (maryAge) in the equation maryAge/30 = 3/5.

We'll solve this by computing maryAge = (3 * aliceAge) / 5. Since ages must be whole numbers, we'll verify that the result is an integer.

```python
# Problem: Find Mary's age given Alice is 30 and Mary/Alice age ratio is 3/5
aliceAge = 30
numerator = 3 * aliceAge
denominator = 5
if numerator % denominator == 0:
    maryAge = numerator // denominator
    print(f"Mary's age is {maryAge}")  # Exact solution found
else:
    print("No integer solution exists for given ratio")
```
