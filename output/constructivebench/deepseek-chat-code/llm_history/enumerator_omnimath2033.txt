This problem involves counting the number of injective functions from Fin 5 to Fin 6 × Fin 6 where:
1. The first component is injective
2. The second component is injective
3. For each input, the first and second components are different

We'll approach this by enumerating all possible valid functions for small parameters (Fin n → Fin m × Fin m) to identify the pattern.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def count_valid_functions(n, m):
    """Count injective functions Fin n → Fin m × Fin m meeting the conditions."""
    if n > m:
        return 0  # Can't have injective functions if n > m
    
    count = 0
    # Generate all possible injective first components
    for fst in permutations(range(m), n):
        # Generate all possible injective second components
        for snd in permutations(range(m), n):
            valid = True
            # Check that no position has equal components
            for i in range(n):
                if fst[i] == snd[i]:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                count += 1
    return count

# Test for small parameters to identify pattern
for n in range(1, 5):
    for m in range(n, n+3):
        print(f"n={n}, m={m}: {count_valid_functions(n, m)}")

# Special case for the original problem (n=5, m=6)
print("\nCalculating for n=5, m=6...")
result = count_valid_functions(5, 6)
print(f"Final answer for n=5, m=6: {result}")
```
