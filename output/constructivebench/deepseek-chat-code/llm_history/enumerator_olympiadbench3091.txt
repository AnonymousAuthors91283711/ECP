The problem involves evaluating the expression `(-T - i) * (i - T)` where `T = 2` and `i` is the imaginary unit. We'll compute this complex multiplication and output the result in exact form.

```python
# Compute (-T - i) * (i - T) where T=2 and i is imaginary unit
T = 2
result = (-T - 1j) * (1j - T)
print(f"Result: {result}")  # Shows exact complex number
print(f"Real part: {result.real}")  # Extract real part
print(f"Imaginary part: {result.imag}")  # Extract imaginary part
```
