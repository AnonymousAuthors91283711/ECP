This problem involves calculating the probability that two randomly selected points from an X-shaped pentomino (union of 4 rectangles) have the property that the line segment connecting them lies entirely within the pentomino. We'll approach this by discretizing the problem and enumerating possible pairs.

```python
import itertools

# Define the X-pentomino as a union of rectangles (x ranges, y ranges)
rectangles = [
    ((0, 1), (1, 2)),   # Center-left
    ((1, 2), (0, 3)),   # Middle vertical
    ((2, 3), (1, 2)),   # Center-right
    ((-1, 0), (1, 2))   # Leftmost
]

def point_in_pentomino(x, y):
    """Check if a point (x,y) is in the X-pentomino"""
    for (x1, x2), (y1, y2) in rectangles:
        if x1 <= x <= x2 and y1 <= y <= y2:
            return True
    return False

def line_in_pentomino(p1, p2, steps=10):
    """Check if line segment between p1 and p2 stays in pentomino"""
    x1, y1 = p1
    x2, y2 = p2
    for t in (i/steps for i in range(steps+1)):
        x = t*x1 + (1-t)*x2
        y = t*y1 + (1-t)*y2
        if not point_in_pentomino(x, y):
            return False
    return True

# Sample points from each rectangle (discretized)
sample_points = []
for (x1, x2), (y1, y2) in rectangles:
    for x in [x1 + 0.25, x1 + 0.5, x1 + 0.75]:
        for y in [y1 + 0.25, y1 + 0.5, y1 + 0.75]:
            if point_in_pentomino(x, y):
                sample_points.append((x, y))

# Count valid pairs
total_pairs = 0
valid_pairs = 0
for p1, p2 in itertools.product(sample_points, repeat=2):
    total_pairs += 1
    if line_in_pentomino(p1, p2):
        valid_pairs += 1
        print(f"Valid pair: {p1} - {p2}")

if total_pairs > 0:
    print(f"Probability estimate: {valid_pairs/total_pairs:.4f}")
else:
    print("No pairs found")
```
