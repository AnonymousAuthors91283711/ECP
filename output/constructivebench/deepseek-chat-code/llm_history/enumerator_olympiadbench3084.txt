This problem involves finding a function f: ℤ → ℕ satisfying specific recurrence relations and boundary conditions, then evaluating f(f(4)). We'll enumerate possible values for f(1) and f(2) that satisfy the given constraints.

The constraints are:
1. f(n) = f(n-1) * f(n-2) for all n ∈ ℤ
2. f(n) > 0 for n > 0
3. f(1) = f(2)/512
4. 1/f(1) = 2*f(2) (in ℚ)

We'll solve these constraints to find possible values for f(1) and f(2), then compute the recurrence to find f(f(4)).

```python
def main():
    # We'll search for f(1) and f(2) that satisfy the constraints
    # From constraint 3: f(2) = 512 * f(1)
    # From constraint 4: 1/f(1) = 2*f(2) => 1/f(1) = 2*512*f(1) => 1 = 1024*f(1)^2
    # So f(1)^2 = 1/1024 => f(1) = 1/32
    # But f must map to ℕ, so this seems impossible. Maybe the constraints are different?
    # Wait, perhaps the division is integer division? Let's try that interpretation.

    # Try f(1) = k, f(2) = 512*k (from constraint 3)
    # Then from constraint 4: 1/k = 2*512*k => 1 = 1024*k^2 => k^2 = 1/1024
    # Still same issue. Maybe the constraints are meant to be exact rational equalities?
    # Alternatively, perhaps f(2)/512 means exact division in ℚ.

    # Since we can't find natural numbers satisfying these constraints exactly,
    # we'll proceed with the rational solution and see what happens.
    
    f1 = 1/32
    f2 = 512 * f1  # = 16
    
    # Now compute the recurrence relation
    # We need to define f for all integers, but the problem only specifies f(n) > 0 for n > 0
    # Let's assume f(0) = a, f(-1) = b, etc.
    # The recurrence is f(n) = f(n-1)*f(n-2)
    # For n=1: f(1) = f(0)*f(-1) => 1/32 = a*b
    # For n=2: f(2) = f(1)*f(0) => 16 = (1/32)*a => a = 512
    # Then b = (1/32)/512 = 1/16384
    
    # Now we can compute f(3) = f(2)*f(1) = 16*(1/32) = 0.5
    # f(4) = f(3)*f(2) = 0.5*16 = 8
    # f(f(4)) = f(8)
    
    # Compute up to f(8):
    f = {}
    f[0] = 512
    f[-1] = 1/16384
    f[1] = 1/32
    f[2] = 16
    
    for n in range(3, 9):
        f[n] = f[n-1] * f[n-2]
        print(f"f({n}) = {f[n]}")
    
    print(f"Final answer: f(f(4)) = f(8) = {f[8]}")
