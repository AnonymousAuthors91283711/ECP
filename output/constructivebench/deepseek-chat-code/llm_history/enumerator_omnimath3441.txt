This problem asks for the natural number `n` such that `10^n ≤ 2014 ≤ 10^(n+1)`. We need to find the exponent `n` where 2014 falls between consecutive powers of 10. We'll enumerate possible values of `n` and check the condition.

```python
def find_exponent():
    n = 0
    while True:
        lower = 10 ** n
        upper = 10 ** (n + 1)
        if lower <= 2014 <= upper:
            print(f"Found n = {n} (since 10^{n} = {lower} ≤ 2014 ≤ {upper} = 10^{n+1})")
            break
        n += 1

find_exponent()
```
