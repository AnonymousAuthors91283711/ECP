This problem asks for the number of functions c: ℤ×ℤ → Fin 2 (i.e., binary functions on integer pairs) that satisfy two functional equations. The equations relate the function's value at (a,b) to its values at transformed coordinates.

To enumerate possible solutions, we'll:
1. Model the functional equations as constraints
2. Find equivalence classes of points where function values must be equal
3. Count independent choices (each equivalence class can be 0 or 1)

The key insight is that the transformations generate a group action, and we need to count functions constant on orbits. We'll implement this by:
- Tracking visited points to avoid redundant checks
- Building equivalence classes using the transformations
- Counting 2^num_orbits

```python
def count_functions():
    visited = set()
    orbit_count = 0
    
    # We'll explore points in a bounded region since the pattern repeats
    for a in range(-10, 11):
        for b in range(-10, 11):
            if (a, b) not in visited:
                orbit_count += 1
                # Generate orbit using the transformations
                current = (a, b)
                orbit = set()
                while current not in orbit:
                    orbit.add(current)
                    # Apply first transformation: (a,b) → (-1-b, a+1)
                    current = (-1 - current[1], current[0] + 1)
                # Mark all points in orbit as visited
                visited.update(orbit)
    
    # Each orbit can be assigned 0 or 1 independently
    print(f"Number of independent orbits: {orbit_count}")
    print(f"Total functions: {2**orbit_count}")

count_functions()
```
