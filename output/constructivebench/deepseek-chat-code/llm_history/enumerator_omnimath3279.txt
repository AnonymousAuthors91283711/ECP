[write_program]
This problem is a simple arithmetic calculation: (25/100)*60. The Python program should compute and output this exact value. Since it's a straightforward calculation, we'll compute it exactly as a fraction and output it in reduced form.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Compute (25/100)*60 as exact fraction
numerator = 25 * 60
denominator = 100
result = Fraction(numerator, denominator)

# Output the reduced fraction
print(result)
```
