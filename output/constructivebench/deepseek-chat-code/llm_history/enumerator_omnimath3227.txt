This problem involves calculating a complex product and taking its real part, then finding the base-2 logarithm. The key is to recognize patterns in the exponents and simplify the expression. Here's a Python program to enumerate possible answers by evaluating the product numerically for small values similar to 2015 (since 2015 is too large for direct computation):

```python
import math
import cmath

def compute_product(N):
    """Compute the product for a given N"""
    product = 1 + 0j
    for a in range(N):
        for b in range(N):
            exponent = 2 * cmath.pi * 1j * (a * b) / N
            term = 1 + cmath.exp(exponent)
            product *= term
    return product.real

def main():
    # Test small values similar to 2015 (which factors into 5*13*31)
    test_values = [5, 13, 31, 65, 155, 403]  # Products of factors of 2015
    
    for N in test_values:
        product_real = compute_product(N)
        if product_real <= 0:
            print(f"N={N}: Product is non-positive, log undefined")
            continue
        
        log2_result = math.log2(product_real)
        print(f"N={N}: log2(product) = {log2_result}")
        
        # Check if result is close to an integer
        rounded = round(log2_result)
        if abs(log2_result - rounded) < 1e-6:
            print(f"  --> Close to integer: {rounded}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program computes the product for smaller values similar to 2015 (its prime factors and products thereof) and calculates the base-2 logarithm of the real part. The output shows the pattern that emerges from these smaller cases, which can help conjecture the general formula. The actual value for 2015 would follow this pattern but isn't computed directly due to its size.
