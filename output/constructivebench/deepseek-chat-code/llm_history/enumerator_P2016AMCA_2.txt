This problem involves solving an exponential equation. We need to find the real value of x that satisfies the equation (10)^x * (100)^(2x) = (1000)^5. The solution involves expressing all terms with the same base (10) and then solving for x.

Here's a Python program that verifies potential solutions by testing values around the expected solution (which can be derived mathematically by converting all terms to base 10 exponents):

```python
def solve_equation():
    # Convert all terms to base 10 exponents:
    # 10^x * (10^2)^(2x) = (10^3)^5
    # 10^x * 10^(4x) = 10^15
    # 10^(5x) = 10^15
    # So 5x = 15 â†’ x = 3
    
    # Verification code that checks the equation holds for x=3
    def check(x):
        left = (10**x) * (100**(2*x))
        right = 1000**5
        return abs(left - right) < 1e-10  # Account for floating point precision
    
    # Test values around the expected solution
    for x in [2.9, 2.95, 2.99, 3.0, 3.01, 3.05, 3.1]:
        if check(x):
            print(f"x = {x} satisfies the equation")
    
    # The exact solution is x = 3
    print("The exact solution is x = 3")

solve_equation()
```
