Ground Truth Answer: {2, 5, 13}
Proposed Answer: {n | ∃ k : ℕ, n = k^2 + 1 ∨ n = k^2 + (k + 1)^2}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the set of natural numbers n that can be expressed as a sum of squares of two coprime numbers (a,b), with the additional condition that every prime ≤ √n divides a*b.

2. The ground truth answer gives specific numbers {2, 5, 13}:
- 2 = 1² + 1² (but 1 and 1 aren't coprime, so this might be an error)
- 5 = 1² + 2² (coprime)
- 13 = 2² + 3² (coprime)

3. The proposed answer gives a pattern:
- Numbers of form k² + 1
- Numbers of form k² + (k+1)²

Looking at small values:
- k=0: 0+1=1 (not in ground truth)
- k=1: 1+1=2, 1+4=5 (both in ground truth)
- k=2: 4+1=5, 4+9=13 (both in ground truth)
- k=3: 9+1=10, 9+16=25 (neither in ground truth)

The proposed answer includes all ground truth numbers (except possibly 2 if we consider the coprime condition), but also includes extra numbers (1,10,25) that don't satisfy all conditions.
