abbrev omnimath3898_answer : Set (ℚ → ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3898 (f : ℚ → ℤ) :
  (∀ (x : ℚ) (a : ℤ) (b : ℤ), 0 < b → f ((f x + a) / b) = f ((x + a) / b)) ↔ f ∈ omnimath3898_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Constant function: f(x) = -2
Constant function: f(x) = -1
Constant function: f(x) = 0
Constant function: f(x) = 1
Constant function: f(x) = 2
Enumeration complete. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℚ → ℤ)
<<<{f | ∃ c : ℤ, f = fun _ => c}>>>
