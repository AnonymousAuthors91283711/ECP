theorem omnimath2071 :
  ∑ n in Ico (10^2018) (10^2019), (digits 10 n).toFinset.card = omnimath2071_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 9 * (10^2019 - 9^2019)
Proposed Answer: 9 * 9^2018
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
- We're summing over all numbers from 10²⁰¹⁸ to (10²⁰¹⁹ - 1)
- For each number, we count the number of distinct digits it contains
- The ground truth answer is 9 * (10²⁰¹⁹ - 9²⁰¹⁹)
- The proposed answer is 9 * 9²⁰¹⁸

Comparison:
1. The ground truth counts all numbers (10²⁰¹⁹ - 10²⁰¹⁸ = 9*10²⁰¹⁸) minus those using only 9 digits (9²⁰¹⁹ - 9²⁰¹⁸), multiplied by 9 (for digits 1-9, as 0 can't be first digit)
2. The proposed answer is just 9 * 9²⁰¹⁸, which is much smaller than the ground truth

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It's missing the scale factor (10²⁰¹⁹ vs 9²⁰¹⁹)
- The exponent is wrong (2018 vs 2019)
- The calculation doesn't properly account for all numbers and their digit distributions
