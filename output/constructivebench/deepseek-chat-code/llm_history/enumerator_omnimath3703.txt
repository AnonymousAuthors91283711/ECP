[write_program]
This problem asks for the set of real numbers `a` such that there exists a function `f: ℝ → ℝ` satisfying the inequality `x + a*f(y) ≤ y + f(f(x))` for all real `x,y`. We'll write a Python program to explore possible values of `a` and corresponding functions `f`.

The approach will:
1. Test small integer values of `a`
2. For each `a`, try simple linear functions f(x) = kx + c
3. Check if the inequality holds for all x,y by verifying coefficients

```python
def check_linear(a, k, c):
    # For f(x) = kx + c, the inequality becomes:
    # x + a*(k*y + c) ≤ y + k*(k*x + c) + c
    # Rearranged: (1 - k^2)x + (a*k - 1)y + (a*c - k*c - c) ≤ 0 for all x,y
    # This can only hold if all coefficients are zero
    coeff_x = 1 - k*k
    coeff_y = a*k - 1
    const_term = a*c - k*c - c
    
    return abs(coeff_x) < 1e-9 and abs(coeff_y) < 1e-9 and abs(const_term) < 1e-9

def find_solutions():
    # Test a range of possible a values
    for a in [0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3]:
        print(f"\nTesting a = {a}")
        found = False
        
        # Try to find k that satisfies 1 - k^2 = 0 and a*k - 1 = 0
        # From 1 - k^2 = 0, k = ±1
        for k in [1.0, -1.0]:
            if abs(a*k - 1) < 1e-9:
                # Now solve for c: a*c - k*c - c = 0 => c*(a - k - 1) = 0
                # Either c = 0 or a - k - 1 = 0
                print(f"Found valid k = {k}")
                
                # Case 1: c = 0
                if check_linear(a, k, 0):
                    print(f"Solution: f(x) = {k}x")
                    found = True
                
                # Case 2: a - k - 1 = 0
                if abs(a - k - 1) < 1e-9:
                    # c can be any real number
                    print(f"Solution: f(x) = {k}x + c for any c ∈ ℝ")
                    found = True
        
        if not found:
            print("No linear solutions found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solutions()
