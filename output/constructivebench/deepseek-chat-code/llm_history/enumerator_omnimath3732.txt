[write_program]
This problem asks to find all real triples (a, b, c) that satisfy three simultaneous equations:
1. a² + ab + c = 0
2. b² + bc + a = 0
3. c² + ca + b = 0

We'll approach this by:
1. Considering symmetric cases where a = b = c
2. Exploring cases where two variables are equal
3. Checking for zero cases
4. Using small integer values to find potential solutions

The program will systematically check these cases and output any valid solutions found.

```python
def find_solutions():
    # Case 1: All variables equal (a = b = c)
    print("Checking symmetric case a = b = c:")
    for a in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
        # Substitute into first equation: a² + a*a + a = 0 => 2a² + a = 0
        if 2*a*a + a == 0:
            print(f"Found symmetric solution: ({a}, {a}, {a})")

    # Case 2: Two variables equal (a = b ≠ c)
    print("\nChecking case a = b ≠ c:")
    for a in [-2, -1, 1, 2]:
        # From first equation: c = -a² - a*a = -2a²
        c = -2*a*a
        # Check second equation: b² + b*c + a = a² + a*(-2a²) + a = a² - 2a³ + a = 0
        if a*a - 2*a*a*a + a == 0:
            print(f"Found solution: ({a}, {a}, {c})")

    # Case 3: One variable is zero
    print("\nChecking cases with one zero:")
    # Subcase: a = 0
    a = 0
    # First equation: 0 + 0 + c = 0 => c = 0
    c = 0
    # Second equation: b² + b*0 + 0 = 0 => b² = 0 => b = 0
    b = 0
    print(f"Found solution: ({a}, {b}, {c})")

    # Case 4: All variables distinct (brute force small integers)
    print("\nChecking distinct small integers:")
    for a in range(-3, 4):
        for b in range(-3, 4):
            if a == b:
                continue
            c = -a*a - a*b
            # Check if this c satisfies other equations
            if abs(b*b + b*c + a) < 1e-9 and abs(c*c + c*a + b) < 1e-9:
                print(f"Found solution: ({a}, {b}, {c})")

    find_solutions()
