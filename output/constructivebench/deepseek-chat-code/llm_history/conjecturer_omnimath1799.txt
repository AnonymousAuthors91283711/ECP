Based on the problem statement and the enumerated answer showing approximately 0.833..., which equals 5/6, I'll provide the corrected answer. The error in the original code appears to be a syntax issue with the let bindings and the theorem statement.

The problem involves calculating the expected value of X(d), where X(d) counts how many of the first 5 elements of a function d (from Fin 6 to Fin 6) match the 6th element. The average is taken over all possible functions d.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<5 / 6>>>

Explanation:
1. For any fixed value of d 5 (the 6th element), the probability that d i = d 5 for any particular i ∈ Fin 5 is 1/6
2. By linearity of expectation, the expected number of matches in the first 5 positions is 5 * (1/6) = 5/6
3. The enumerated answer confirms this exact value (0.833... = 5/6)
4. The error in the original code was likely due to improper line breaks between the let bindings and the theorem statement, but the mathematical content remains correct[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
