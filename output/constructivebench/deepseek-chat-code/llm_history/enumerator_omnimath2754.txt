[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number `n` such that there exist natural numbers `a < b < c < n` with `a + b + c + n = 100`. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal `n` by enumerating possible values and checking the conditions.

The approach:
1. Iterate `n` from 1 upwards
2. For each `n`, iterate possible `c` values (must be <n)
3. For each `c`, iterate possible `b` values (must be <c)
4. For each `b`, calculate `a` and check if it's positive and <b
5. The first `n` that satisfies these conditions is our answer

```python
def find_min_n():
    for n in range(1, 100):
        # c must be <n and at least 2 (since a < b < c)
        for c in range(2, n):
            # b must be <c and at least 1
            for b in range(1, c):
                a = 100 - n - c - b
                if a > 0 and a < b:
                    print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, n={n}")
                    return n
    return None

min_n = find_min_n()
print(f"The minimal n is: {min_n}")
```
