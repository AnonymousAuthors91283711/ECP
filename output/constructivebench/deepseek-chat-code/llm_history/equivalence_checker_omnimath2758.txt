Ground Truth Answer: fun k => 3 * k
Proposed Answer: fun _ : ℝ => 6
Let's analyze the problem and answers carefully:

1. The problem is about finding a function `omnimath2758_answer : ℝ → ℝ` such that when the calculated area equals 80, the function evaluated at k equals 6.

2. The ground truth answer `fun k => 3 * k` is a function that depends on k, and indeed when k=2, we get 3*2=6, which satisfies the condition when area=80.

3. The proposed answer `fun _ : ℝ => 6` is a constant function that always returns 6 regardless of input. This only satisfies the condition when k=2, but fails for all other values of k where area=80 might hold.

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It doesn't maintain the functional relationship with k
- It only works for one specific case (k=2) rather than being a general solution
- The ground truth shows the answer should vary with k, not be constant
