[write_program]
This problem asks to find the unique pair of positive integers (x, y) that satisfies the equation 19x + 17y = 201. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible solutions and identify the unique one.

The approach is to iterate through possible values of x (from 1 upwards) and for each x, check if (201 - 19x) is divisible by 17 and results in a positive y. We'll stop when x becomes too large to yield a positive y.

```python
def find_solutions():
    solutions = []
    max_x = 201 // 19 + 1  # Upper bound for x
    for x in range(1, max_x + 1):
        remainder = 201 - 19 * x
        if remainder > 0 and remainder % 17 == 0:
            y = remainder // 17
            if y > 0:
                solutions.append((x, y))
                print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}")  # Stream partial results
    
    if len(solutions) == 1:
        print(f"Unique solution: {solutions[0]}")
    else:
        print(f"Found {len(solutions)} solutions: {solutions}")

find_solutions()
```
