This problem appears to be a simple arithmetic calculation that can be evaluated directly. The expression is `(20 - 16) * (12 + 8) / 4`, which simplifies to `4 * 20 / 4 = 20`. Since the problem asks for exact values, we'll compute this directly in Python.

```python
# Compute the exact value of (20 - 16) * (12 + 8) / 4
result = (20 - 16) * (12 + 8) / 4
print(result)
```
