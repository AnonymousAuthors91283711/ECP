This problem asks for the number of pairs (a,b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, b ≥ 0, and the quadratic x² + ax + b factors over the integers. We need to count these pairs and return the count modulo 1000.

The key insight is that for x² + ax + b to factor as (x+c)(x+d), we must have:
1. c + d = a
2. c * d = b
Since c and d must be integers, we can iterate through possible integer pairs (c,d) that satisfy these conditions.

```python
def count_factorable_pairs():
    count = 0
    max_a = 100
    for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
        # Find all integer pairs (c,d) where c + d = a and c*d >= 0
        # We can assume c <= d without loss of generality
        for c in range(-abs(a), abs(a) + 1):
            d = a - c
            if d < c:  # Skip duplicates where (d,c) is same as (c,d)
                continue
            b = c * d
            if b >= 0:  # b must be non-negative
                count += 1
    print(f"Total count: {count}")
    print(f"Answer mod 1000: {count % 1000}")

count_factorable_pairs()
