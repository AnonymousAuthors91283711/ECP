[write_program]
This problem involves a recurrence relation with three initial conditions and a recursive definition. We'll write a Python program to compute the sequence values for n ≥ 3 to identify any patterns or closed-form solutions.

The recurrence is:
- f(0) = 2001
- f(1) = 2002
- f(2) = 2003
- f(k+3) = f(k+1) + f(k) - f(k+2) for k ≥ 0

We'll compute the sequence up to n=20 to observe its behavior.

```python
def compute_sequence(max_n):
    # Initialize the sequence with given values
    f = [2001, 2002, 2003]
    
    for n in range(3, max_n + 1):
        next_val = f[n-2] + f[n-3] - f[n-1]
        f.append(next_val)
        print(f"f({n}) = {next_val}")

# Compute sequence up to n=20
compute_sequence(20)
```
