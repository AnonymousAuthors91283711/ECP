This problem asks for the cardinality of the smallest set S containing 0 that is closed under adding 8 and 9. We'll enumerate all numbers reachable from 0 by adding 8s and 9s up to a threshold, then find the smallest number where all larger numbers are in the set (the Frobenius number for 8 and 9 is 55, so all numbers â‰¥56 are in S).

```python
def generate_set(threshold):
    S = {0}
    queue = [0]
    while queue:
        k = queue.pop(0)
        for delta in [8, 9]:
            new_k = k + delta
            if new_k <= threshold and new_k not in S:
                S.add(new_k)
                queue.append(new_k)
    return sorted(S)

threshold = 100
S = generate_set(threshold)
print("Numbers in S up to threshold:", S)

# Find the minimal number where all larger numbers are in S
max_missing = max(k for k in range(threshold+1) if k not in S)
print("Largest missing number:", max_missing)
print("Cardinality of S up to threshold:", len(S))
print("Total cardinality (including all numbers > max_missing):", len(S) + (threshold - max_missing))
```
