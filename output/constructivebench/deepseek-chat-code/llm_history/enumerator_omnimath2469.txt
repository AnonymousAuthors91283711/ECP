The problem asks for the maximum value of the function \(2^{x(1-x)}\) for \(x\) in the interval \([0, 1]\). To find this, we can:

1. Evaluate the function at critical points (where derivative is zero) and endpoints
2. The derivative of \(x(1-x)\) is \(1-2x\), which equals zero at \(x=0.5\)
3. The maximum value occurs at \(x=0.5\) since the exponent \(x(1-x)\) is maximized there

Here's a Python program to verify this by evaluating the function at various points in the interval:

```python
def f(x):
    return 2 ** (x * (1 - x))

# Evaluate at endpoints and critical point
points = [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]
for x in points:
    print(f"x = {x}: f(x) = {f(x)}")

# Also check some other points to be thorough
additional_points = [0.25, 0.75]
for x in additional_points:
    print(f"x = {x}: f(x) = {f(x)}")

# The maximum value is clearly at x=0.5
print("\nMaximum value occurs at x=0.5 with value", f(0.5))
```
