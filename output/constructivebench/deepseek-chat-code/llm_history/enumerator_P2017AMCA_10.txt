This problem appears to be about calculating the ratio of two areas in ℝ²:
1. The area where y > x (set P)
2. The area of the rectangle [0,2017]×[0,4034]

We'll compute this ratio numerically by:
1. Calculating the total area of the rectangle (2017 × 4034)
2. Calculating the area where y ≤ x within the rectangle (a triangle plus a rectangle)
3. Subtracting to get the area where y > x
4. Computing the ratio

```python
def compute_ratio():
    # Define the rectangle dimensions
    x_min, x_max = 0, 2017
    y_min, y_max = 0, 4034
    
    # Total area of the rectangle
    total_area = (x_max - x_min) * (y_max - y_min)
    
    # Area where y <= x
    # For x <= 2017, y <= x forms a triangle (0,0) to (2017,2017) to (2017,0)
    # Plus a rectangle from y=2017 to y=4034 for x=0 to x=2017
    triangle_area = 0.5 * 2017 * 2017
    rectangle_area = 2017 * (4034 - 2017)
    y_leq_x_area = triangle_area + rectangle_area
    
    # Area where y > x
    y_gt_x_area = total_area - y_leq_x_area
    
    # Compute the ratio
    ratio = y_gt_x_area / total_area
    
    # Print exact fraction and decimal approximation
    print(f"Exact fraction: {y_gt_x_area}/{total_area}")
    print(f"Decimal approximation: {ratio}")
    return ratio
