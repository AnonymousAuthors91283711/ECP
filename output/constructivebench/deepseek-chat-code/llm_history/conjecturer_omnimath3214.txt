Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 7, which is at "omnimath3214_answer " in "abbrev omnimath3214_answer : ℝ := 5 / 2", there is an error: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instDivInvMonoid', and it does not have executable code

. Enumerated Answers: Minimal t found: 2.000000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the problem statement and the enumerated answer showing the minimal t is 2.0, I'll propose the correct Lean expression. The error occurs because we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real numbers. Also, we should use the exact value 2 rather than 5/2 (which equals 2.5).

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev omnimath3214_answer : ℝ := 2>>>

Explanation:
1. The enumerated answer shows the minimal t is exactly 2.0
2. The problem involves real numbers (ℝ) and division, making it noncomputable in Lean
3. The original proposed answer 5/2 was incorrect (it equals 2.5, not 2.0)
4. The correct minimal value satisfying all constraints is 2, as verified by enumeration
5. We mark it noncomputable to handle real number operations properly in Lean

The constraints describe a transportation problem where:
- Walking distance ≤ 6t
- Riding distance ≤ 90t
- Total distance (walk + ride) = 135 for each of 3 points
- Any two ride distances sum to ≤ 90t
The minimal t satisfying all conditions is indeed 2.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

. Enumerated Answers: Minimal t found: 2.000000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the problem statement and the enumerated answer showing the minimal t is 2.0, I'll provide the corrected Lean answer. The error occurred because of incorrect syntax - we don't need to repeat the declaration and the 'noncomputable' keyword should be at the start.

The problem involves finding the minimal time t where:
1. Walking distance ≤ 6t for each person
2. Riding distance ≤ 90t for each person
3. Walk + ride distances sum to 135 for each person
4. Any two people's ride distances sum ≤ 90t

The solution t=2 comes from considering the worst case where two people need maximum ride time while satisfying all constraints.
