The problem asks to find the absolute difference between two positive real numbers x₁ and x₂ that satisfy:
1. log₂x₁ + log₂x₂ = 4
2. x₁ + x₂ = 12

We can approach this by:
1. Combining the logarithmic condition to get log₂(x₁x₂) = 4 ⇒ x₁x₂ = 2^4 = 16
2. We now have sum (x₁+x₂=12) and product (x₁x₂=16)
3. The numbers are roots of t² - 12t + 16 = 0
4. Solving gives t = [12 ± √(144-64)]/2 = [12 ± √80]/2 = 6 ± 2√5
5. The absolute difference is |(6+2√5)-(6-2√5)| = 4√5

Here's a Python program to verify this numerically:

```python
import math

# Verify the solution numerically
x1 = 6 + 2 * math.sqrt(5)
x2 = 6 - 2 * math.sqrt(5)

# Check conditions
sum_log = math.log2(x1) + math.log2(x2)
sum_x = x1 + x2
difference = abs(x1 - x2)

print(f"x1: {x1}, x2: {x2}")
print(f"Sum of logs: {sum_log} (should be 4)")
print(f"Sum of x's: {sum_x} (should be 12)")
print(f"Absolute difference: {difference}")
```
