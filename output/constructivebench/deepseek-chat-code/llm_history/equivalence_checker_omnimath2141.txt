Ground Truth Answer: 7 + (13 * π) / 3
Proposed Answer: (4/3) * π * (2^3) + π * (2^2) * 6
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about calculating the average number of integer-coordinate cubes (p,q,r) where a unit sphere centered at (x,y,z) intersects the cube (p,p+1)×(q,q+1)×(r,r+1).

2. The ground truth answer is 7 + (13π)/3.

3. The proposed answer is (4/3)*π*(2^3) + π*(2^2)*6.

Let's simplify the proposed answer:
- (4/3)*π*8 = (32/3)π ≈ 33.51
- π*4*6 = 24π ≈ 75.40
- Total ≈ 108.91

The ground truth answer:
- 7 ≈ 7
- (13π)/3 ≈ 13.61
- Total ≈ 20.61

These are clearly different values. The proposed answer seems to be calculating something like the volume of a larger sphere plus cylindrical terms, which doesn't match the problem's requirements.
