This problem appears to be a simple arithmetic calculation disguised as a theorem. The expression (25 + 386)*200/(100 + 100 + 400) can be computed directly. I'll write a Python program that calculates this value exactly.

```python
# Calculate (25 + 386) * 200 / (100 + 100 + 400)
numerator = (25 + 386) * 200
denominator = 100 + 100 + 400
result = numerator / denominator

# Print the exact value
print(f"Exact value: {result}")
print(f"Simplified fraction: {numerator}/{denominator} = {numerator//100}/{denominator//100}")
```
