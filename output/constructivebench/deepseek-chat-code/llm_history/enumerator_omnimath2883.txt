The problem asks to find two distinct natural numbers `odot` and `nabla` between 1 and 19 such that `odot^3 = nabla`, then compute `nabla^2`. We need to enumerate all possible pairs and check the condition.

```python
def main():
    for odot in range(1, 20):  # odot from 1 to 19
        nabla = odot ** 3
        if nabla < 20 and odot != nabla:  # check conditions
            print(f"odot={odot}, nabla={nabla}, nabla^2={nabla * nabla}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
