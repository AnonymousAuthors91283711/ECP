The problem involves calculating a specific linear combination of points defined by evenly spaced steps between P=3 and V=33, divided into 6 parts. We need to compute (S - P) + (V - T) where the points are equally spaced. The Python program will calculate this value exactly.

```python
def main():
    P = 3
    V = 33
    parts = 6
    step = (V - P) / (parts + 1)
    
    Q = P + step
    R = Q + step
    S = R + step
    T = S + step
    U = T + step
    
    result = (S - P) + (V - T)
    
    # Print exact value if it's an integer, otherwise as float
    if result.is_integer():
        print(int(result))
    else:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
