[write_program]
This problem asks for all positive integer triples (a,b,c) such that a³ + b³ + c³ = (abc)². We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such triples up to a reasonable limit.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible values of a, b, c up to a threshold (we'll use 100)
2. For each combination, check if the equation holds
3. Print valid triples as they're found
4. Since the problem asks for all solutions, we'll print them without further processing

```python
def find_triples(max_n=100):
    found = False
    for a in range(1, max_n + 1):
        for b in range(1, max_n + 1):
            for c in range(1, max_n + 1):
                lhs = a**3 + b**3 + c**3
                rhs = (a * b * c)**2
                if lhs == rhs:
                    print(f"Found solution: ({a}, {b}, {c})")
                    found = True
    if not found:
        print(f"No solutions found up to {max_n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_triples()
```
