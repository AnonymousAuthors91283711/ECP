[write_program]
This problem is asking to evaluate √((√81 + √81)/2). Since √81 is exactly 9, we can simplify the expression mathematically. However, since the task is to write a Python program to enumerate possible answers, I'll create a program that calculates this expression numerically and verifies it against potential exact values.

The program will:
1. Calculate the exact mathematical value (which we know is 3, but won't hardcode)
2. Compare it with potential exact values (like integers from 1 to 10)
3. Output the exact match when found

```python
import math

def calculate_expression():
    sqrt_81 = math.sqrt(81)
    numerator = sqrt_81 + sqrt_81
    denominator = 2
    return math.sqrt(numerator / denominator)

def main():
    exact_value = calculate_expression()
    print(f"Calculated value: {exact_value}")
    
    # Check against potential exact integer values
    for i in range(1, 11):
        if math.isclose(exact_value, i, rel_tol=1e-9):
            print(f"Exact match found: {i}")
            return
    
    print("No exact integer match found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
