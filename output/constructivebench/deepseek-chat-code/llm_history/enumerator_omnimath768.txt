This problem involves counting intersecting pairs of 4×4 subgrids in an 8×8 grid. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible pairs and count the intersecting ones to find the probability ratio.

The approach:
1. Represent each 4×4 subgrid by its top-left corner coordinates (r,c)
2. Generate all possible pairs of subgrids (S,T)
3. Count pairs that intersect (non-empty intersection)
4. Calculate the probability ratio

```python
def main():
    size = 8
    subgrid_size = 4
    possible_positions = range(size - subgrid_size + 1)
    
    total_pairs = 0
    intersecting_pairs = 0
    
    # Enumerate all possible pairs of subgrids
    for r1 in possible_positions:
        for c1 in possible_positions:
            for r2 in possible_positions:
                for c2 in possible_positions:
                    total_pairs += 1
                    # Check if subgrids intersect
                    if (r1 < r2 + subgrid_size and r2 < r1 + subgrid_size and
                        c1 < c2 + subgrid_size and c2 < c1 + subgrid_size):
                        intersecting_pairs += 1
    
    # Calculate the probability ratio
    probability = intersecting_pairs / total_pairs
    print(f"Total subgrid pairs: {total_pairs}")
    print(f"Intersecting pairs: {intersecting_pairs}")
    print(f"Probability ratio: {probability}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
