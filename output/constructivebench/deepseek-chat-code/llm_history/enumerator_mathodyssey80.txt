This problem asks for the maximum value of z = 9x + y under two linear constraints. We'll solve it by enumerating possible vertices of the feasible region formed by the constraints and evaluating z at each vertex.

The approach:
1. Find intersection points of the constraint boundaries (vertices)
2. Evaluate z = 9x + y at each vertex
3. Identify the maximum z value

```python
def find_max_z():
    # Constraint 1: 2x - 5y = -6
    # Constraint 2: 3x + 6y = 25
    
    # Find intersection points (vertices)
    # Solve the system of equations:
    # 2x - 5y = -6
    # 3x + 6y = 25
    
    # Using substitution method:
    # From first equation: x = (5y - 6)/2
    # Substitute into second equation:
    # 3*(5y-6)/2 + 6y = 25
    # Multiply both sides by 2:
    # 15y - 18 + 12y = 50
    # 27y = 68
    # y = 68/27
    
    y_intersect = 68/27
    x_intersect = (5*y_intersect - 6)/2
    
    # Find x-intercepts (y=0)
    x1 = -6/2  # from 2x = -6
    x2 = 25/3  # from 3x = 25
    
    # Find y-intercepts (x=0)
    y1 = 6/5   # from -5y = -6
    y2 = 25/6  # from 6y = 25
    
    # Evaluate z at all candidate points
    points = [
        (x_intersect, y_intersect),  # Intersection point
        (x1, 0),                     # x-intercept of first constraint
        (x2, 0),                     # x-intercept of second constraint
        (0, y1),                     # y-intercept of first constraint
        (0, y2)                      # y-intercept of second constraint
    ]
    
    max_z = -float('inf')
    for x, y in points:
        # Check if point satisfies both constraints
        if (2*x - 5*y <= -6) and (3*x + 6*y <= 25):
            z = 9*x + y
            print(f"Point ({x:.4f}, {y:.4f}) gives z = {z:.4f}")
            if z > max_z:
                max_z = z
    
    print(f"\nMaximum value of z is: {max_z:.4f}")

find_max_z()
```
