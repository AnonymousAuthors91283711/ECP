This problem involves calculating the probability of getting all 5 dice showing 20 (count20s = 5) given that at least 3 dice show 20 (count20s ≥ 3) when rolling 5d20. We'll compute this by enumerating all possible dice combinations that satisfy the conditions.

The approach is:
1. Calculate total number of outcomes with ≥3 20s
2. Calculate number of outcomes with exactly 5 20s
3. Compute the probability as (2)/(1)

```python
from math import comb

def main():
    dice_faces = 20
    num_dice = 5
    target = dice_faces - 1  # since dice are 0-19 in the problem
    
    # Calculate total outcomes with ≥3 target faces
    total = 0
    for k in range(3, num_dice + 1):
        # comb(num_dice, k) ways to choose which dice show target
        # (dice_faces-1)^(num_dice - k) ways for other dice
        total += comb(num_dice, k) * ((dice_faces - 1) ** (num_dice - k))
    
    # Calculate successful outcomes (all 5 show target)
    success = 1  # only one way: all dice show target
    
    # Output probability as fraction
    print(f"{success}/{total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
