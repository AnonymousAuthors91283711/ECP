Found: 728 (base9: 888). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the enumerated answers and the problem statement, we can observe that:
1. The numbers satisfy a = b + 9c + 81a (from the theorem)
2. The base9 representations show a pattern of digits increasing by 1 each time
3. The decimal values form an arithmetic sequence starting at 82 with common difference 9

The general solution appears to be numbers of the form 82 + 9k where k ranges from 0 to 80 (since 82 + 9*80 = 802 < 999 and next would exceed 3 digits).

Found: 728 (base9: 888). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the enumerated answers and the problem statement, we can observe a clear pattern:
1. The answers are all numbers between 82 and 728
2. They follow the form 82 + 9*k where k ranges from 0 to 71 (since 82 + 9*71 = 721, and the next would be 730 which exceeds 728)
3. The base9 representations show palindromic patterns (like 101, 111, 121, etc.)

The problem requires finding a number that satisfies two conditions when represented in base9:
1. abc = a + 9*b + 81*c
2. abc = b + 9*c + 81*a

This suggests we need numbers where the base9 representation is palindromic when rotated. The simplest solution is to take numbers where a = c in base9 representation.

The correct closed form solution in Lean should be:

<<<82 + 9 * 71>>> 

Explanation:
1. The maximum valid number in the enumerated list is 728 (base9: 888)
2. 728 = 82 + 9*71 (since (728-82)/9 = 71.777..., we take floor)
3. This represents the largest valid solution in the range
4. The problem likely expects a single solution, and 728 is the maximal case that satisfies all conditions

Note: If multiple solutions are needed, we would need to define a set or function, but based on the problem statement and error message, a single numeric answer is expected.
