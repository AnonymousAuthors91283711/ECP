This problem asks for the number of 99-element subsets of a 19×19 grid where any two distinct points are at least 2 units apart in either their x-coordinates or y-coordinates (or both). This is equivalent to counting independent sets in a grid graph with a specific separation condition.

To approach this computationally, we'll:
1. Model the grid as coordinates (i,j) where 0 ≤ i,j < 19
2. Generate all possible 99-point subsets that satisfy the separation condition
3. Count the valid configurations

However, enumerating all combinations is computationally infeasible. Instead, we'll demonstrate the pattern by solving smaller instances and look for a pattern.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_valid_subset(subset):
    for p in subset:
        for q in subset:
            if p == q:
                continue
            dx = abs(p[0] - q[0])
            dy = abs(p[1] - q[1])
            if dx <= 1 and dy <= 1:
                return False
    return True

def count_valid_subsets(n, k):
    """Count k-subsets of n×n grid with separation condition"""
    points = [(i,j) for i in range(n) for j in range(n)]
    count = 0
    for subset in combinations(points, k):
        if is_valid_subset(subset):
            count += 1
    return count

# Demonstrate with small cases
for n in [2, 3, 4]:
    max_k = n*n
    for k in range(1, max_k+1):
        cnt = count_valid_subsets(n, k)
        if cnt > 0:
            print(f"n={n}, k={k}: {cnt} valid subsets")
    print()

# For n=19, k=99, the exact count would be computationally intensive
# The pattern suggests it's related to independent sets on grid graphs
print("For n=19, k=99, the exact count would follow from combinatorial patterns")
```
