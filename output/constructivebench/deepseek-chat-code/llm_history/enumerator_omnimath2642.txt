[write_program]
This problem involves finding natural numbers a and b that satisfy the equation 8*a^a*b^b = 27*a^b*b^a, then computing a² + b². We'll write a Python program to search for such pairs (a,b) within a reasonable range.

The approach is:
1. Iterate through possible values of a and b (up to a reasonable limit)
2. For each pair, check if they satisfy the equation
3. Print valid pairs and compute a² + b²
4. Since the problem asks for a specific answer, we'll output the minimal a² + b² found

```python
def main():
    max_n = 20  # Reasonable upper bound for search
    min_sum_sq = float('inf')
    
    for a in range(1, max_n + 1):
        for b in range(1, max_n + 1):
            lhs = 8 * (a ** a) * (b ** b)
            rhs = 27 * (a ** b) * (b ** a)
            if lhs == rhs:
                sum_sq = a*a + b*b
                print(f"Found valid pair (a={a}, b={b}), a² + b² = {sum_sq}")
                if sum_sq < min_sum_sq:
                    min_sum_sq = sum_sq
    
    if min_sum_sq != float('inf'):
        print(f"Minimal a² + b² found: {min_sum_sq}")
    else:
        print("No valid pairs found in the search range")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
