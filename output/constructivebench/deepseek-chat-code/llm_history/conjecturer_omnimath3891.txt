abbrev omnimath3891_answer : Set (ℤ × ℤ × ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3891 :
    {abc | ∃ a b c : ℤ,
      1 < a ∧ a < b ∧ b < c ∧
      (a - 1) * (b - 1) * (c - 1) ∣ a * b * c - 1} = omnimath3891_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for triples (a,b,c) where 1<a<b<c and (a-1)(b-1)(c-1)|(abc-1)
Found triple: (2, 4, 8)
Found triple: (3, 5, 15). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ × ℤ)
<<<{(2, 4, 8), (3, 5, 15), (2, 4, 8), (3, 5, 15)}>>>
