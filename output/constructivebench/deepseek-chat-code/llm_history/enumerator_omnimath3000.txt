[write_program]
The problem asks to find how many numbers in the set {19, 21, 23, 25, 27} can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. We'll write a Python program to check each number in the set and count how many satisfy this condition.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if n is a prime number."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n in (2, 3):
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for p in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % p == 0:
            return False
    return True

def can_be_sum_of_two_primes(n):
    """Check if n can be written as sum of two primes."""
    for p in range(2, n // 2 + 1):
        q = n - p
        if is_prime(p) and is_prime(q):
            return True
    return False

def main():
    S = {19, 21, 23, 25, 27}
    count = 0
    for n in sorted(S):
        if can_be_sum_of_two_primes(n):
            print(f"{n} can be expressed as sum of two primes")
            count += 1
        else:
            print(f"{n} cannot be expressed as sum of two primes")
    print(f"Total numbers expressible as sum of two primes: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
