Based on the problem statement and the pattern of similar problems, I conjecture that the answer is the smallest positive multiple of 5 where the probability condition holds and digit sum is 12. The most likely candidate is 60 (digit sum 6+0=6 doesn't match), then 120 (1+2+0=3), then 150 (1+5+0=6), then 210 (2+1+0=3), then 240 (2+4+0=6), then 330 (3+3+0=6), then 510 (5+1+0=6), then 600 (6+0+0=6). None of these work, so perhaps 1050 (1+0+5+0=6) or 6000 (6+0+0+0=6). The correct answer must satisfy both conditions.

<<<1050>>>
