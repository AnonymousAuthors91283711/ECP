The problem asks for the minimal possible value of f(0) where f is a quadratic function satisfying:
1. f(1) = 16
2. f(x) ≥ (x+3)^2 for all x
3. f(x) ≥ x^2 + 9 for all x

We'll approach this by:
1. Parameterizing the quadratic function f(x) = ax² + bx + c
2. Using the constraints to derive conditions on a, b, c
3. Finding the minimal c (which equals f(0)) satisfying all conditions

```python
import math

def find_min_f0():
    min_f0 = float('inf')
    
    # We'll iterate through possible 'a' values (must be >=1 from constraints)
    for a in [1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.0]:
        # From f(1) = 16: a + b + c = 16 => c = 16 - a - b
        # From f(x) >= (x+3)^2 at x=0: c >= 9
        # From f(x) >= x^2 +9 at x=0: c >= 9
        # The minimal c occurs when both inequalities are tight at some points
        
        # Find b such that f is tangent to one of the lower bounds
        # We'll check tangency conditions with both lower bounds
        
        # Case 1: tangent to (x+3)^2
        # f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c
        # g(x) = (x+3)^2
        # Tangency requires f(x0) = g(x0) and f'(x0) = g'(x0)
        # This gives:
        # 2a x0 + b = 2(x0 + 3)
        # a x0^2 + b x0 + c = (x0 + 3)^2
        # Using c = 16 - a - b
        
        # Solving the derivative condition: b = 6 - (2a - 2)x0
        # Substitute into f(x0)=g(x0) and c=16-a-b
        
        # Alternatively, we can find b where discriminant is zero for f(x)-(x+3)^2
        # The equation is (a-1)x^2 + (b-6)x + (c-9) = 0
        # Discriminant: (b-6)^2 - 4(a-1)(c-9) = 0
        
        # Similarly for the other constraint f(x) >= x^2 +9
        # The equation is (a-1)x^2 + b x + (c-9) = 0
        # Discriminant: b^2 - 4(a-1)(c-9) = 0
        
        # We'll try both cases and take the minimal c
        
        # Case 1: discriminant zero for f(x)-(x+3)^2
        c1 = 9 + (6 - 2*math.sqrt(a-1))**2 / (4*(a-1)) if a > 1 else float('inf')
        b1 = 6 - 2*math.sqrt((a-1)*(c1-9))
        f0_case1 = 16 - a - b1
        
        # Case 2: discriminant zero for f(x)-(x^2+9)
        c2 = 9 + (2*math.sqrt(a-1))**2 / (4*(a-1)) if a > 1 else float('inf')
        b2 = 2*math.sqrt((a-1)*(c2-9))
        f0_case2 = 16 - a - b2
        
        # Also need to check if both constraints are satisfied
        current_min = min(f0_case1, f0_case2)
        if current_min < min_f0 and current_min >= 9:
            min_f0 = current_min
            print(f"Found candidate: a={a}, f(0)={current_min}")
    
    print(f"Minimum f(0) found: {min_f0}")

find_min_f0()
