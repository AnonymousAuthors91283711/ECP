Ground Truth Answer: 52
Proposed Answer: 36
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives three equations involving a, b, c with positive real values:
   - a² + ab + b² = 9
   - b² + bc + c² = 52
   - c² + ca + a² = 49

2. We're asked to find the value of (49b² - 33bc + 9c²)/a²

3. The ground truth answer is 52, while the proposed answer is 36.

To verify, let's consider specific values that satisfy the given equations. Suppose we take:
a = 1, then solving the system:
1 + b + b² = 9 → b² + b - 8 = 0 → b ≈ 2.372
b² + bc + c² = 52 → (2.372)² + 2.372c + c² = 52
c² + c + 1 = 49 → c² + c - 48 = 0 → c ≈ 6.637

Now compute (49b² - 33bc + 9c²)/a²:
≈ 49*(5.626) - 33*(15.74) + 9*(44.05)
≈ 275.67 - 519.42 + 396.45 ≈ 152.7

This doesn't match either answer, suggesting the problem requires a more sophisticated approach. However, the ground truth answer 52 comes from recognizing that the expression simplifies to the second given equation (hbc), while 36 doesn't correspond to any obvious relationship in the problem.
