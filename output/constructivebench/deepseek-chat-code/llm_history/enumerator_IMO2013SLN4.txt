[write_program]
This problem asks whether there exists a sequence of digits (1-9) such that for all sufficiently large k, the k-digit number formed by the sequence is a perfect square. We'll write a program to search for such sequences up to a reasonable length.

The approach:
1. Generate all possible digit sequences of increasing length
2. For each sequence, check if the formed number is a perfect square
3. Track sequences where all numbers beyond a certain length are squares

```python
import math

def is_square(n):
    root = math.isqrt(n)
    return root * root == n

def search(max_length=10):
    # We'll use BFS to explore sequences level by level
    from collections import deque
    queue = deque()
    
    # Start with all possible single digits (1-9)
    for d in range(1, 10):
        queue.append(([d], d))
    
    while queue:
        seq, num = queue.popleft()
        current_length = len(seq)
        
        if current_length > max_length:
            continue
            
        # Check if current number is square
        square_check = is_square(num)
        print(f"Sequence: {seq}, Number: {num}, Is square: {square_check}")
        
        # For sequences that are getting long, check if all extensions would need to be squares
        if current_length >= 5 and square_check:
            print(f"Potential candidate found: {seq}")
            
        # Extend the sequence with each possible digit
        for d in range(1, 10):
            new_seq = seq + [d]
            new_num = num * 10 + d
            queue.append((new_seq, new_num))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Searching for digit sequences where all sufficiently long numbers are squares")
    search(max_length=8)
```
