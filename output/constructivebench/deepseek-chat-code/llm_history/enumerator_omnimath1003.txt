[write_program]
This problem asks for the maximum value of \(x \cdot y \cdot z\) under the constraints \(x, y, z > 0\) and \(x \cdot y + z = (x + z)(y + z)\). We'll write a Python program to explore this relationship numerically and find candidate maximum values.

The approach:
1. Rewrite the constraint equation to \(z = \frac{xy(1 - x - y)}{x + y + xy}\)
2. Sample x and y in (0,1) since x+y must be <1 to keep z positive
3. Compute z from the equation and then x*y*z
4. Track the maximum product found

```python
import numpy as np

def find_max_xyz_product():
    max_product = 0
    best_xyz = (0, 0, 0)
    
    # Sample x and y in (0,1) with small steps
    for x in np.linspace(0.01, 0.99, 100):
        for y in np.linspace(0.01, 1 - x - 0.01, 100):
            numerator = x * y * (1 - x - y)
            denominator = x + y + x * y
            if denominator == 0:
                continue
            z = numerator / denominator
            if z <= 0:
                continue
            product = x * y * z
            if product > max_product:
                max_product = product
                best_xyz = (x, y, z)
                print(f"New max product: {product:.6f} at (x,y,z)={best_xyz}")
    
    print(f"\nFinal maximum product found: {max_product:.10f}")
    print(f"Corresponding (x,y,z): {best_xyz}")

find_max_xyz_product()
```
