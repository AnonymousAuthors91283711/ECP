This problem asks for the number of injective functions from Fin 4 (a set with 4 elements) to Fin 9 (a set with 9 elements) that satisfy certain ordering constraints. Specifically, the function values must be strictly increasing at positions 1,0,2 and strictly decreasing at position 3,2.

We'll enumerate all possible injective functions from 4 elements to 9 elements (permutations) and count those that satisfy the constraints:
1. q(1) < q(0)
2. q(1) < q(2)
3. q(3) < q(2)

The program will generate all 4-length combinations from 0 to 8 (Fin 9), check if they're injective (all distinct), and then verify the ordering constraints.

```python
from itertools import combinations

count = 0
# Generate all 4-length combinations from 0 to 8 (Fin 9)
for q in combinations(range(9), 4):
    # Check ordering constraints: q1 < q0 and q1 < q2 and q3 < q2
    if q[1] < q[0] and q[1] < q[2] and q[3] < q[2]:
        # All elements are distinct by nature of combinations
        count += 1
        print(q)  # Print each valid combination

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
