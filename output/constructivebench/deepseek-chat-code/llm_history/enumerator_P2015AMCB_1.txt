[write_program]
The problem asks to compute the exact value of the expression 2 - (-2)^(-2). We'll write a Python program to compute this value exactly as a fraction. Since the expression involves negative exponents, we'll need to handle fractions carefully.

The key steps are:
1. Compute (-2)^(-2) which equals 1/(-2)^2 = 1/4
2. Subtract this from 2: 2 - 1/4 = 7/4

The program will compute this exact fraction and print it in reduced form.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_expression():
    # Compute (-2)^(-2) as a fraction
    negative_two_pow_neg_two = Fraction(1, (-2)**2)
    # Compute 2 - the above fraction
    result = Fraction(2, 1) - negative_two_pow_neg_two
    # Print the exact fraction
    print(result)

compute_expression()
```
