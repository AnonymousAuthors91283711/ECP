This problem asks to find the exact value of 3^127 + 2^127. Since directly computing these large exponents is feasible in Python with arbitrary precision integers, we can simply compute and print the result.

```python
# Compute 3^127 + 2^127 exactly using Python's arbitrary precision integers
result = 3**127 + 2**127
print(result)
```
