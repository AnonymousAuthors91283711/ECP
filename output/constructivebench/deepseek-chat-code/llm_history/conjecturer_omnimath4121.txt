abbrev omnimath4121_answer : ℚ → ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath4121 (f : ℚ → ℚ) :
  (∀ x y : ℚ, 0 < x → 0 < y → f (f x^2 * y) = x^3 * f (x * y)) ↔ f = omnimath4121_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking polynomial solutions of form f(x) = kx^n:
Found valid exponent n = -1
Possible coefficients:
- k = 0 (f(x) = 0)

Exact solutions:
1. f(x) = 0
2. f(x) = x^1.5 (but requires rational exponents)
No other polynomial solutions found. Expected Answer Type: ℚ → ℚ
<<<fun x : ℚ => 0>>>
