This problem asks for the maximum number of vertices (k) in a graph with 10 vertices and 40 edges where:
1. The graph is simple (edges connect distinct vertices)
2. If a vertex is connected to all others, it must be in the graph (closure condition)
3. We count how many vertices are connected to all others

We'll enumerate all possible graphs with these properties to find the maximal k.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def solve():
    n = 10  # number of vertices
    m = 40  # number of edges
    max_k = 0
    
    # We'll consider all possible sizes k for the clique of universal vertices
    for k in range(1, n):
        # The k universal vertices form a complete graph: k*(k-1)/2 edges
        clique_edges = k * (k - 1) // 2
        
        # Remaining edges must come from the other n-k vertices
        remaining_edges = m - clique_edges
        if remaining_edges < 0:
            continue
            
        # Each of the n-k vertices can connect to at most k universal vertices
        # and to each other (but we need to count carefully)
        max_possible = (n - k) * k + (n - k) * (n - k - 1) // 2
        
        if remaining_edges <= max_possible:
            print(f"Possible configuration with k = {k}")
            if k > max_k:
                max_k = k
    
    print(f"Maximum k found: {max_k}")

solve()
```
