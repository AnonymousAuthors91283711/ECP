The problem is to find the smallest integer \( x \) such that the average of five consecutive integers starting from \( x \) is 9. The equation simplifies to \((5x + 10)/5 = 9\), which further simplifies to \(x + 2 = 9\), so \(x = 7\). We'll verify this by enumerating possible integer values around this solution.

```python
def find_min_x():
    # The equation simplifies to (5x + 10)/5 = 9 => x + 2 = 9 => x = 7
    # We'll verify by checking x values around 7
    for x in range(5, 10):  # Check a small range around the expected solution
        avg = (x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + (x + 3) + (x + 4)) / 5
        if avg == 9:
            print(f"Found valid x: {x}")
            # Since we're looking for the least x, we can stop after first hit
            print(f"Minimum x is: {x}")
            return
    print("No solution found")

find_min_x()
```
