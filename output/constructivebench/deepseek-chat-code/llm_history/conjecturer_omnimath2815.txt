theorem omnimath2815
(x y : ℝ)
(hxy1 : 3 * x + 2 * y = 6)
(hxy2 : 9 * x ^ 2 + 4 * y ^ 2 = 468)
: x * y = omnimath2815_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solution found: x = -4, y = 9, x*y = -36
Solution found: x = 6, y = -6, x*y = -36

Symbolic form of x*y: 3*x*(2 - x)/2. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<< -36 >>>
