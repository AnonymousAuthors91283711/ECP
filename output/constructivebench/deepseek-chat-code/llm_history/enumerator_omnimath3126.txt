The problem is to find the sum `a + b` given the functional equation `(x + a)(x + 8) = x² + b x + 24` for all real `x`. We can expand the left side and compare coefficients to find exact values for `a` and `b`.

1. Expand the left side: `(x + a)(x + 8) = x² + (a + 8)x + 8a`
2. Compare coefficients with the right side `x² + b x + 24`:
   - `x²` terms match (1=1)
   - `x` terms: `a + 8 = b`
   - Constant terms: `8a = 24` ⇒ `a = 3`
3. Substitute `a = 3` into the second equation: `b = 3 + 8 = 11`
4. Final sum: `a + b = 3 + 11 = 14`

The Python program will verify this by checking the equation holds for sample x values with these a and b values.

```python
# Verify the solution by checking the equation holds for sample x values
a = 3
b = 11
print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}")

# Test the equation for several x values
for x in [-2, 0, 1, 5]:
    left = (x + a) * (x + 8)
    right = x**2 + b * x + 24
    print(f"x = {x}: {left} == {right} ({left == right})")

# Output the final sum
print(f"a + b = {a + b}")
```
