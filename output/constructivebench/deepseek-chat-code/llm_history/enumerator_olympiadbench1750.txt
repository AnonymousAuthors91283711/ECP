This problem involves finding the maximum number of triples (t) in a directed graph (d) with specific properties. To approach this, we'll:

1. Model the problem with smaller parameters (n=6 instead of 2006)
2. Enumerate possible directed graphs with n-3 edges (since d.card=2003 implies n-3 edges)
3. Count valid triples that satisfy all conditions
4. Track the maximum count found

The key constraints are:
- The graph is oriented (no mutual edges)
- For every triple in t, at least one edge exists in the graph
- The triple must satisfy either distance equality or odd distance conditions

```python
import itertools

def main():
    n = 6  # Smaller parameter for enumeration
    max_edges = n - 3  # Corresponds to d.card=2003 in original problem
    max_triples = 0
    
    # Generate all possible directed graphs with max_edges edges (no mutual edges)
    vertices = range(n)
    possible_edges = [(i,j) for i in vertices for j in vertices if i != j]
    
    for edges in itertools.combinations(possible_edges, max_edges):
        # Check if graph is oriented (no mutual edges)
        oriented = True
        for (i,j) in edges:
            if (j,i) in edges:
                oriented = False
                break
        if not oriented:
            continue
        
        # Count valid triples
        triple_count = 0
        for x, y, z in itertools.permutations(vertices, 3):
            if x == y or y == z or z == x:
                continue
            
            # Condition 1: at least one edge exists
            edge_condition = ((x,y) in edges) or ((y,z) in edges) or ((z,x) in edges)
            
            # Condition 2: distance equality
            d1 = min(abs(y-x), n-abs(y-x))
            d2 = min(abs(z-y), n-abs(z-y))
            d3 = min(abs(x-z), n-abs(x-z))
            dist_condition = (d1 == d2) or (d2 == d3) or (d3 == d1)
            
            # Condition 3: odd distance pairs
            odd_condition = ((d1%2==1 and d2%2==1) or 
                           (d2%2==1 and d3%2==1) or 
                           (d3%2==1 and d1%2==1))
            
            if edge_condition and (dist_condition or odd_condition):
                triple_count += 1
        
        if triple_count > max_triples:
            max_triples = triple_count
            print(f"New max triples: {max_triples} with edges: {edges}")
    
    print(f"Final maximum triples for n={n}: {max_triples}")
