[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of natural number triples (a, b, c) where 2^a + 2^b = c!. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such triples up to reasonable limits, counting the number of solutions found.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible c values (factorial base)
2. For each c, compute c! and find all pairs (a,b) where 2^a + 2^b = c!
3. Since the equation is symmetric in a and b, we can assume a â‰¤ b without loss of generality
4. We'll limit c to a reasonable value where c! doesn't exceed 2^64

```python
import math

def find_solutions():
    solutions = []
    max_c = 20  # 20! is 2.4e18, which fits in 64 bits
    for c in range(1, max_c + 1):
        target = math.factorial(c)
        # Since 2^a + 2^b = target and a <= b, 2^a (1 + 2^(b-a)) = target
        max_a = target.bit_length() - 1
        for a in range(0, max_a + 1):
            pow_a = 1 << a
            remaining = target - pow_a
            if remaining <= 0:
                continue
            if remaining & (remaining - 1) != 0:  # check if remaining is power of 2
                continue
            b = remaining.bit_length() - 1
            if (1 << b) == remaining:
                solutions.append((a, b, c))
                solutions.append((b, a, c))  # count both orderings
    # Remove duplicates when a == b
    unique_solutions = []
    seen = set()
    for sol in solutions:
        if sol not in seen:
            seen.add(sol)
            unique_solutions.append(sol)
    # Print all solutions found
    for sol in sorted(unique_solutions):
        print(sol)
    print(f"Total number of solutions: {len(unique_solutions)}")

find_solutions()
```
