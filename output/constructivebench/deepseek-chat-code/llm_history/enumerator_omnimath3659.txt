This problem asks for the largest subset S of {1, 2, ..., 1000} where no two distinct elements sum to another element in S. This is similar to sum-free set problems. We'll enumerate possible candidates by checking subsets of increasing size.

The approach:
1. Start with the largest possible subset size (500) and check downwards
2. For each size k, check if a sum-free subset exists
3. The first k where such a subset exists is the answer

We'll use the probabilistic method heuristic that the largest sum-free subset is likely the largest odd numbers up to 1000 (which gives 500 elements), but we'll verify smaller cases to be sure.

```python
def is_sum_free(subset):
    elements = set(subset)
    n = len(subset)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if subset[i] + subset[j] in elements:
                return False
    return True

def find_largest_sum_free():
    max_n = 1000
    # Check the obvious candidate first: all odd numbers
    odd_candidate = list(range(1, max_n+1, 2))
    if is_sum_free(odd_candidate):
        print(f"Found candidate with size {len(odd_candidate)}: all odd numbers")
        return len(odd_candidate)
    
    # If that fails, check decreasing sizes
    for k in range(max_n//2, 0, -1):
        # Try simple arithmetic progression candidates
        for step in [2, 3, 4, 5]:
            candidate = list(range(1, 1 + step*k, step))
            if len(candidate) == k and is_sum_free(candidate):
                print(f"Found candidate with size {k}: {candidate[:10]}...")
                return k
        # Try largest numbers
        candidate = list(range(max_n - k + 1, max_n + 1))
        if is_sum_free(candidate):
            print(f"Found candidate with size {k}: largest numbers")
            return k
    
    return 0

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = find_largest_sum_free()
    print(f"Final answer: {result}")
```
