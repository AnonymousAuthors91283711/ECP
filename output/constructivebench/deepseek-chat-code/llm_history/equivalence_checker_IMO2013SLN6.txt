abbrev IMO2013SLN6_answer : Set (ℚ → ℤ) := sorry
theorem IMO2013SLN6 (f : ℚ → ℤ) :
  (∀ x a b, b > 0 → f (f x + a / b) = f (-x + a / b)) ↔ f ∈ IMO2013SLN6_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: { f | (∃ c : ℤ, f = fun _ => c) ∨ 
         f = Int.floor ∘ (fun (x : ℚ) => (x : ℝ)) ∨ 
         f = Int.ceil ∘ (fun (x : ℚ) => (x : ℝ)) }
Proposed Answer: {f : ℚ → ℤ | ∃ c : ℤ, ∀ x : ℚ, f x = c}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer captures only the constant functions part of the solution (the first disjunct in the ground truth answer), but misses the floor and ceiling function cases. Therefore, it's partially correct but incomplete. The "Close" designation is appropriate because the proposed answer is correct for a subset of the solutions but doesn't cover all cases.
