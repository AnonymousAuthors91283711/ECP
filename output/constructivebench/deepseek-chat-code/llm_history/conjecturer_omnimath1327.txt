Looking at the error message and the enumerated answer, I notice that:
1. The error suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real number division
2. The enumerated answer shows a value very close to -375/2 (-187.5)
3. The problem involves a recursive relation with division

The error occurs because Lean requires explicit marking of noncomputable definitions when working with real numbers. The value -375/2 matches the enumerated answer when converted to decimal (-187.5).

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev omnimath1327_answer : ℝ := -375/2>>>

The answer is conjectured based on:
1. The enumerated value matches -375/2 exactly when converted
2. The recursive relation in the problem likely leads to this simple fraction
3. The noncomputable marker is needed for real number operations in Lean[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the error message and the enumerated answer (-187.5), we need to properly represent this real number in Lean. The error occurs because Lean needs explicit type annotations for real number literals. The pattern from the recurrence relation suggests the answer is a simple fraction.

The correct way to write -375/2 in Lean as a real number is to use the division operator for reals and properly annotate the numeric literals. Here's the fixed version:

<<<(-375 : ℝ) / 2>>>

Explanation:
1. The enumerated answer shows a100 ≈ -187.5, which equals -375/2
2. In Lean, we need to explicitly cast integer literals to ℝ when doing real division
3. The parentheses ensure proper operator precedence
4. This matches the pattern seen in the recurrence relation where fractions appear
5. The answer is noncomputable due to real number operations, but that's expected for this problem type

The error was caused by using integer division syntax (-375/2) without proper real number type annotations. The fixed version uses real division with proper type casting.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the error message and the enumerated answer, I'll propose a corrected version of the answer. The error suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real number division. The enumerated answer shows a value very close to -375/2 (-187.5), confirming our proposed answer is correct in form but needs proper Lean syntax.

Here's the fixed answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev omnimath1327_answer : ℝ := -375 / 2>>>

Explanation:
1. The error indicates we need to mark the definition as noncomputable due to real number operations
2. The enumerated answer shows a value extremely close to -187.5, which equals -375/2
3. The pattern in the recurrence relation suggests the answer should be a simple fraction
4. We keep the answer in fractional form (-375/2) rather than decimal for exactness
5. The type annotation : ℝ ensures we're working with real numbers

The answer maintains the mathematical correctness while fixing the Lean compilation error through proper noncomputable annotation.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the error message and the enumerated answer, we need to make the answer noncomputable since it involves real numbers. The pattern from the enumerated answer suggests a value close to -375/2 (-187.5). Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable def omnimath1327_answer : ℝ := -375 / 2>>>

Explanation:
1. The error indicates we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real number division.
2. The enumerated answer shows a value very close to -375/2 (-187.5), suggesting this is the exact closed-form solution.
3. The problem involves a recursive relation with division, which typically leads to rational solutions when starting with rational inputs.
4. The answer maintains the exact form rather than using a decimal approximation.
