This problem involves analyzing a recursive sequence `a_n` and finding the least upper bound for a sum involving another sequence `x_k`. To approach this computationally, we'll:

1. Compute the sequence `a_n` up to n=2002
2. For small values of parameters, try to find patterns in the optimal `x_k` values
3. Compute the sum for various candidate `x_k` patterns to conjecture the minimal bound

Here's a Python program that computes the `a_n` sequence and explores simple patterns for `x_k`:

```python
import math

def compute_a_sequence(max_n):
    """Compute the recursive sequence a_n up to max_n"""
    a = [0.0] * (max_n + 1)
    a[1] = 1/4
    for n in range(2, max_n + 1):
        a[n] = 0.25 * (1 + a[n-1])**2
    return a

def compute_sum(x_pattern, a_n, max_k=2002):
    """Compute the sum for a given x_pattern function"""
    total = 0.0
    x_values = [0.0] * (max_k + 1)
    
    # Generate x values according to pattern
    for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
        x_values[k] = x_pattern(k)
    
    for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
        # Compute denominator components
        sum_x = sum(x_values[i] for i in range(k, max_k + 1))
        k_term = (k * (k - 1)) / 2
        denominator = (x_values[k] + sum_x + k_term + 1)**2
        
        # Compute A_k and add to total
        A_k = (x_values[k] - k) / denominator
        total += A_k
    
    return total

def main():
    max_n = 2002
    a = compute_a_sequence(max_n)
    print(f"a[{max_n}] = {a[max_n]}")

    # Test different x patterns
    patterns = [
        ("x_k = k", lambda k: k),
        ("x_k = k^2", lambda k: k**2),
        ("x_k = sqrt(k)", lambda k: math.sqrt(k)),
        ("x_k = 0", lambda k: 0),
    ]
    
    for name, pattern in patterns:
        total = compute_sum(pattern, a)
        ratio = total / a[max_n]
        print(f"{name}: sum = {total}, ratio = {ratio}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program:
1. Computes the recursive sequence `a_n` up to n=2002
2. Tests several simple patterns for `x_k` (linear, quadratic, square root, zero)
3. For each pattern, computes the sum and the ratio sum/a_2002
4. Outputs these values to help identify potential minimal bounds

Note that the actual minimal bound would require more sophisticated optimization of the `x_k` sequence, but this provides a starting point for empirical investigation. The recursive nature of `a_n` suggests the bound might involve exponential or doubly exponential growth.
