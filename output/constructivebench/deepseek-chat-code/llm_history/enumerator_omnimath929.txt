[write_program]
This problem involves computing a ratio of products involving Fibonacci (F) and Lucas (L) numbers. We'll write a Python program to compute the exact value of this ratio by calculating the Fibonacci and Lucas sequences up to the required terms, then performing the specified products.

```python
def compute_ratio():
    # Compute Fibonacci numbers F_n up to F_30 (since we need F_2*15=F_30)
    F = [0] * 31  # 0-indexed, F[0] unused
    F[1] = F[2] = 1
    for n in range(3, 31):
        F[n] = F[n-1] + F[n-2]
    
    # Compute Lucas numbers L_n up to L_13
    L = [0] * 14  # 0-indexed, L[0] unused
    L[1], L[2] = 1, 2
    for n in range(3, 14):
        L[n] = L[n-1] + L[n-2]
    
    # Compute numerator product: product_{n=1 to 15} F[2n]/F[n]
    numerator = 1
    for n in range(1, 16):
        numerator *= F[2*n] / F[n]
    
    # Compute denominator product: product_{n=1 to 13} L[n]
    denominator = 1
    for n in range(1, 14):
        denominator *= L[n]
    
    ratio = numerator / denominator
    print(f"Computed ratio: {ratio}")

compute_ratio()
```
