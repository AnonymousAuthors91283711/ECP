[write_program]
This problem involves iterating a cubic function f(x) = x³ - 3x starting from x = 5/2, applying it 8 times, taking the floor of the result, converting to a natural number, and counting its divisors. We'll write a Python program to compute this value exactly.

The approach:
1. Implement exact rational arithmetic using fractions to avoid floating-point errors
2. Define the function f(x) = x³ - 3x
3. Iterate this function 8 times starting from 5/2
4. Take the floor of the final result
5. Convert to integer and count divisors

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def f(x):
    return x**3 - 3*x

def count_divisors(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i*i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            if i*i == n:
                count += 1
            else:
                count += 2
        i += 1
    return count

def main():
    x = Fraction(5, 2)
    for _ in range(8):
        x = f(x)
    final_value = int(x) if x.denominator == 1 else int(x)  # floor operation
    num_divisors = count_divisors(final_value)
    print(f"Final value: {final_value}")
    print(f"Number of divisors: {num_divisors}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
