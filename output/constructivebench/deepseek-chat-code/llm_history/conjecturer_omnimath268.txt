abbrev omnimath268_answer : Set (Fin 14 → ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath268 :
  {n : Fin 14 → ℤ | (∀ i : Fin 14, n i ≥ 0) ∧ (∑ i : Fin 14, (n i)^4) = 1599} = omnimath268_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: timeout triggered. Expected Answer Type: Set (Fin 14 → ℤ)
Based on the problem statement asking for non-negative integer vectors of length 14 whose fourth powers sum to 1599, and considering the relatively small sum, the solution likely consists mostly of 0s, 1s, and 2s. The most plausible answer is:

<<<{n : Fin 14 → ℤ | (∀ i, n i = 0 ∨ n i = 1 ∨ n i = 2) ∧ (∑ i, (n i)^4) = 1599}>>>
