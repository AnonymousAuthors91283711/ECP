    (x y : ℝ)
    (hxy : x - y = 4 ∧ x ^ 3 - y ^ 3 = 28) :
    x * y = omnimath1485_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x = 1, y = -3, xy = -3
x = 3, y = -1, xy = -3

Algebraic solution approach:
Solving x² + x(x-4) + (x-4)² = 7
Which simplifies to 3x² - 12x + 16 = 7
Then 3x² - 12x + 9 = 0
Solutions: x = [1, 3]
Corresponding y values: y = x-4 = [-3, -1]
Thus possible xy pairs:
x=1, y=-3 → xy=-3
x=3, y=-1 → xy=-3

From both approaches, the consistent solution is xy = -3. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<(-3 : ℝ)>>>
