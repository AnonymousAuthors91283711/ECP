[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of permutations of 5 distinct heights (65-69) where no two adjacent elements in the permutation differ by exactly 1. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all valid permutations.

The approach:
1. Generate all permutations of the heights [65,66,67,68,69]
2. For each permutation, check if any adjacent pair differs by exactly 1
3. Count the valid permutations that satisfy the condition

```python
from itertools import permutations

def main():
    heights = [65, 66, 67, 68, 69]
    count = 0
    
    for perm in permutations(heights):
        valid = True
        for i in range(len(perm)-1):
            if abs(perm[i] - perm[i+1]) == 1:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1
            print(perm)  # Print each valid permutation
    
    print(f"Total valid permutations: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
