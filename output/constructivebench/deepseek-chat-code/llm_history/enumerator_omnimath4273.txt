[write_program]
This problem involves finding all real numbers α such that for every positive integer n, the sum S(α, n) = ∑_{i=1}^n floor(i*α) is divisible by n. We'll write a Python program to search for such α values by testing small rational numbers and checking the divisibility condition for small n values.

The approach will:
1. Test rational numbers α = p/q with small denominators
2. For each candidate α, check the divisibility condition for n up to a reasonable bound
3. Output candidates that satisfy the condition for all tested n

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def check_alpha(alpha, max_n=10):
    """Check if alpha satisfies the condition for all n from 1 to max_n"""
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        total = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total += math.floor(i * alpha)
        if total % n != 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_candidates(max_denominator=5, max_n=10):
    """Search for rational candidates with denominators up to max_denominator"""
    candidates = []
    for q in range(1, max_denominator + 1):
        for p in range(0, 2 * q + 1):
            alpha = Fraction(p, q)
            if check_alpha(float(alpha), max_n):
                candidates.append(alpha)
    return candidates

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Searching for α values where S(α,n) ≡ 0 mod n for small n...")
    print("Testing rationals with denominators up to 5 and n up to 10:")
    candidates = find_candidates()
    for alpha in candidates:
        print(f"Found candidate: α = {alpha} ({float(alpha):.2f})")
    print("Note: The pattern suggests α may need to be integer-valued.")
```
