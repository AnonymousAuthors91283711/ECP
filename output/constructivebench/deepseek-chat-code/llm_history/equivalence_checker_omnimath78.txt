theorem omnimath78 (p q : ℕ) : 
  p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ p * q ∣ 5^p + 5^q ↔ (p, q) ∈ omnimath78_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (5, 2), (5, 5), (5, 313), (313, 5)}
Proposed Answer: {(2, 3), (2, 5), (5, 2), (3, 2), (5, 5)}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but missing the pairs (5, 313) and (313, 5) which are present in the ground truth answer. The other pairs listed in the proposed answer are all correct and match the ground truth. The missing pairs represent valid solutions where one prime is 5 and the other is 313, which satisfies the divisibility condition p*q divides 5^p + 5^q.
