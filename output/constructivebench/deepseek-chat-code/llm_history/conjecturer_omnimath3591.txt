From the problem statement and enumerated answers, we're looking for a condition that characterizes when a finite non-empty set A of natural numbers exists where for every a in A, either 2a is in A or (a is divisible by 3 and a/3 is in A). The simplest such sets are those containing powers of 2 or powers of 3, suggesting the answer should allow for these cases.
