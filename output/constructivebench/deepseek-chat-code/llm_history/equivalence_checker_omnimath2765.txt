abbrev omnimath2765_answer : ℚ → ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath2765 (n : ℚ) : 
  1/(2 * n) + 1/(4 * n) = 3/12 ↔ n = omnimath2765_answer 3 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n
Proposed Answer: fun _ : ℚ => 3
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem states an equation: 1/(2n) + 1/(4n) = 3/12
2. Simplifying the left side: (2/4n + 1/4n) = 3/4n
3. The equation becomes: 3/4n = 3/12
4. Solving for n: 4n = 12 → n = 3

The ground truth answer correctly shows that n must be 3 for the equation to hold, by returning the identity function (since the equation simplifies to n = 3).

The proposed answer incorrectly returns a constant function that always returns 3, regardless of input. This doesn't match the mathematical relationship expressed in the problem.
