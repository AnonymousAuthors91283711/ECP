[write_program]
This problem asks to find the positive real number x such that x^(2*x^6) = 3. We'll write a Python program to numerically approximate this solution using binary search since the function is strictly increasing for x > 0.

The approach:
1. Define the function f(x) = x^(2*x^6) - 3
2. Use binary search to find where f(x) = 0
3. The search range is between 1 and 2 since:
   - At x=1: 1^(2*1^6) = 1 < 3
   - At x=2: 2^(2*2^6) = 2^128 â‰ˆ 3.4e38 > 3

```python
def find_x():
    def f(x):
        return x ** (2 * x**6) - 3
    
    left = 1.0
    right = 2.0
    tolerance = 1e-10
    
    while right - left > tolerance:
        mid = (left + right) / 2
        if f(mid) < 0:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid
    
    # Print the approximation with 10 decimal places
    print(f"{left:.10f}")

find_x()
```
