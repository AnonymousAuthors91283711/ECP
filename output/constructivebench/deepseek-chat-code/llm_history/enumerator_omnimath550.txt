This problem involves finding the minimal cost `c` such that starting with 0 beans, we can reach a state with more than 2008 beans where the number of beans modulo 100 is 42. The operations are:
- "True" step: multiply beans by 5 (costs 1)
- "False" step: add 1 bean (costs 5)

We'll enumerate possible sequences of operations (as booleans) up to a reasonable length, tracking the minimal cost that satisfies the conditions.

```python
from collections import deque

def find_min_cost():
    min_cost = float('inf')
    # Use BFS to explore states (beans, cost)
    # Track visited states to avoid redundant work
    visited = set()
    queue = deque()
    queue.append((0, 0))
    visited.add((0, 0))
    
    while queue:
        beans, cost = queue.popleft()
        
        # Check if current state meets conditions
        if beans > 2008 and beans % 100 == 42:
            if cost < min_cost:
                min_cost = cost
                print(f"New minimal cost found: {cost}")
        
        # Don't explore further if we already have a better solution
        if cost >= min_cost:
            continue
        
        # Generate next states
        # Operation 1: multiply by 5 (cost +1)
        new_beans1 = beans * 5
        new_cost1 = cost + 1
        if (new_beans1, new_cost1) not in visited and new_cost1 < min_cost:
            visited.add((new_beans1, new_cost1))
            queue.append((new_beans1, new_cost1))
        
        # Operation 2: add 1 (cost +5)
        new_beans2 = beans + 1
        new_cost2 = cost + 5
        if (new_beans2, new_cost2) not in visited and new_cost2 < min_cost:
            visited.add((new_beans2, new_cost2))
            queue.append((new_beans2, new_cost2))
    
    print(f"Final minimal cost: {min_cost}")

find_min_cost()
