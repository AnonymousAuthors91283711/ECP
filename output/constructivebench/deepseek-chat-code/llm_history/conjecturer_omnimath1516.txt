theorem omnimath1516 :
  let switchProb (t : ℕ) : ℚ := 1/(2 * t^2)
  let stayProb (t : ℕ) : ℚ := 1 - switchProb t
  let rec p : ℕ → ℚ
    | 0 => 1      | 1 => 1
    | n + 1 => stayProb (n + 1) * p n + switchProb (n + 1) * (1 - p n)
  p 15 = omnimath1516_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: p(2) = 7/8
p(3) = 5/6
p(4) = 13/16
p(5) = 4/5
p(6) = 19/24
p(7) = 11/14
p(8) = 25/32
p(9) = 7/9
p(10) = 31/40
p(11) = 17/22
p(12) = 37/48
p(13) = 10/13
p(14) = 43/56
p(15) = 23/30

Final result:
p(15) = 23/30. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<(2 * 15 + 1) / (3 * 15)>>>
