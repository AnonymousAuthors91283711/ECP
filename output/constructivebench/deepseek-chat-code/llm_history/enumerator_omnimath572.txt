[write_program]
This problem involves a recursive sequence A(n) with given initial conditions and a recurrence relation. We need to enumerate the sequence values to observe their convergence behavior. The recurrence involves both a linear combination of previous terms and a rational term.

We'll write a Python program to compute the sequence values up to a reasonable index (say n=50) to observe the convergence. We'll print each term to see how it stabilizes.

```python
def compute_sequence(max_n=50):
    # Initialize first three terms
    A = [0.0, 1.0, 2.0]
    print(f"A(0) = {A[0]}")
    print(f"A(1) = {A[1]}")
    print(f"A(2) = {A[2]}")
    
    for n in range(3, max_n + 1):
        # Compute the next term using the recurrence relation
        term = (A[n-1] + A[n-2] + A[n-3]) / 3
        rational_term = 1 / (n**4 - n**2)
        next_term = term + rational_term
        A.append(next_term)
        print(f"A({n}) = {next_term}")
        
        # Check for convergence by comparing with previous term
        if n > 10 and abs(A[n] - A[n-1]) < 1e-10:
            print(f"Sequence appears to converge around {next_term}")
            break

compute_sequence()
```
