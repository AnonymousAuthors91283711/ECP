This problem involves finding positive integers w, d, a, b that satisfy 7 given linear equations. We'll approach this by enumerating possible values for the variables while respecting the constraints.

The strategy is:
1. Iterate through possible values of b first since it has large coefficients
2. For each b, iterate through possible a values
3. For each (b,a) pair, solve for d and w from the equations
4. Check if all equations are satisfied with positive integers

```python
def solve():
    # We'll limit b to a reasonable range since coefficients are large
    max_b = 10
    max_a = 20
    max_d = 20
    max_w = 20
    
    solutions = []
    
    for b in range(1, max_b + 1):
        for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
            # Use equation 1 and 2 to solve for w and d
            # 201 = 6w + 4d + 30a + 63b
            # 200 = 6w + 3d + 35a + 60b
            # Subtract them: 1 = d - 5a + 3b => d = 1 + 5a - 3b
            
            d = 1 + 5*a - 3*b
            if d <= 0:
                continue
                
            # Now solve for w using equation 1
            # 201 = 6w + 4d + 30a + 63b
            w_numerator = 201 - 4*d - 30*a - 63*b
            if w_numerator <= 0 or w_numerator % 6 != 0:
                continue
            w = w_numerator // 6
            if w <= 0:
                continue
                
            # Now verify all other equations
            eq3 = w*6 + d*4 + a*30 + b*54
            eq4 = w*6 + d*4 + a*28 + b*55
            eq5 = w*5 + d*7 + a*18 + b*59
            eq6 = w*4 + d*7 + a*32 + b*59
            eq7a = w*4 + d*7 + a*36 + b*55
            eq7b = w*4 + d*7 + a*36 + b*55  # Same as eq7a
            
            if (eq3 == 192 and eq4 == 191 and eq5 == 178 and 
                eq6 == 176 and eq7a == 176):
                solutions.append((w, d, a, b))
                print(f"Found solution: w={w}, d={d}, a={a}, b={b}")
    
    if solutions:
        print("\nAll solutions found:")
        for sol in solutions:
            print(sol)

        print("No solutions found in the given range")
