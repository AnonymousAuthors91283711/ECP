[write_program]
This problem asks to find a natural number `n` such that `n^4` equals the sum of three cubes: `5508^3 + 5625^3 + 5742^3`. We'll write a Python program to compute the right-hand side and check if it's a perfect fourth power.

The approach is:
1. Compute the sum of cubes
2. Check if the sum is a perfect fourth power by taking its integer fourth root and verifying
3. Since the numbers are large, we'll use Python's arbitrary precision integers

```python
def main():
    # Compute the sum of cubes
    sum_cubes = 5508**3 + 5625**3 + 5742**3
    
    # Find the integer fourth root
    n = int(round(sum_cubes ** (1/4)))
    
    # Check nearby integers in case of floating point inaccuracies
    for delta in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
        candidate = n + delta
        if candidate**4 == sum_cubes:
            print(f"Found solution: {candidate}")
            return
    
    print("No solution found in the vicinity")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
