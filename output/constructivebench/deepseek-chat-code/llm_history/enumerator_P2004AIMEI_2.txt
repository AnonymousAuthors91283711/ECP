[write_program]
This problem involves finding an integer `m` such that:
1. There exists an integer `a` where the sum of `m` consecutive integers starting from `a` equals `2m`
2. There exists an integer `b` where the sum of `2m` consecutive integers starting from `b` equals `m`
3. The absolute difference between the last terms of these sequences is 99

We'll write a program to enumerate possible values of `m` and check these conditions.

```python
def sum_consecutive(start, count):
    """Sum of 'count' consecutive integers starting from 'start'"""
    return count * (2 * start + count - 1) // 2

def find_m():
    for m in range(1, 200):  # Reasonable upper bound based on problem context
        # Condition 1: sum of m consecutive numbers = 2m
        # Solve for a: m*(2a + m - 1)/2 = 2m => 2a + m - 1 = 4 => a = (5 - m)/2
        a = (5 - m) / 2
        if not a.is_integer():
            continue
        
        # Condition 2: sum of 2m consecutive numbers = m
        # Solve for b: 2m*(2b + 2m - 1)/2 = m => 2b + 2m - 1 = 1 => b = (2 - 2m)/2 = 1 - m
        b = 1 - m
        
        # Condition 3: |(a + m - 1) - (b + 2m - 1)| = 99
        last_a = a + m - 1
        last_b = b + 2*m - 1
        if abs(last_a - last_b) == 99:
            print(f"Found candidate m = {m}")
            print(f"a = {int(a)}, b = {int(b)}")
            print(f"Last terms: {last_a} and {last_b}")
            print(f"Difference: {abs(last_a - last_b)}")
            print("---")
    
    print("Enumerated all candidates up to m=200")

find_m()
```
