theorem P2002AMCB_6 (a b : ℝ) (ha : a ≠ 0) (hb : b ≠ 0) :

Ground Truth Answer: {(1, -2)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b) | (a = 1 ∧ b = -2) ∨ (a = -1/2 ∧ b = -1/2)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all pairs (a,b) where a,b≠0 and both a and b are roots of the polynomial x² + a x + b.

2. Ground truth gives only one solution: (1, -2).

3. Proposed answer gives two solutions: (1, -2) and (-1/2, -1/2).

Let's test the proposed solutions:
- For (1, -2): 
  Polynomial becomes x² + x - 2
  Roots are x=1 and x=-2 (b=-2 is indeed a root)
  
- For (-1/2, -1/2):
  Polynomial becomes x² - (1/2)x - 1/2
  Roots are x=1 and x=-1/2 (b=-1/2 is indeed a root)

The proposed answer is actually correct - both pairs satisfy the conditions. The ground truth answer is incomplete as it misses the second valid solution.
