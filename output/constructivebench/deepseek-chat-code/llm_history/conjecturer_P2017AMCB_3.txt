abbrev P2017AMCB_3_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2017AMCB_3 :
  (∀ x y : ℝ, (x ≠ 0 ∧ y ≠ 0 ∧ (3 * x + y) / (x - 3 * y) = -2) →
    (x + 3 * y) / (3 * x - y) = P2017AMCB_3_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: For x=1.0, y=1.0: (x+3y)/(3x-y) = 2.0
For x=2.0, y=2.0: (x+3y)/(3x-y) = 2.0
For x=3.0, y=3.0: (x+3y)/(3x-y) = 2.0
For x=0.5, y=0.5: (x+3y)/(3x-y) = 2.0
For x=-1.0, y=-1.0: (x+3y)/(3x-y) = 2.0
For x=-2.0, y=-2.0: (x+3y)/(3x-y) = 2.0
The constant value appears to be: 2.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
