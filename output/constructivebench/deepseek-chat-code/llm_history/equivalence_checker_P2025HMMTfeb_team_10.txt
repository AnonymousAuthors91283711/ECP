Ground Truth Answer: {n | ∀ p : ℕ, p.Prime → p ≡ 3 [MOD 4] → padicValNat p n ≠ 1}
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, n = k^2 ∨ n = 2 * k^2 ∨ n = 5 * k^2 ∨ n = 10 * k^2}
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer states that n must not have any prime factor ≡ 3 mod 4 with an odd exponent (specifically excluding exponent 1). This means:
- All prime factors ≡ 3 mod 4 must appear with even exponents (since ≠1 implies 0 or ≥2)
- Other primes can appear with any exponent

The proposed answer suggests n must be of the form:
1. k² (all exponents even)
2. 2*k² (only the exponent of 2 is odd, others even)
3. 5*k² (only the exponent of 5 is odd, others even)
4. 10*k² (exponents of 2 and 5 are odd, others even)

The key differences:
1. The proposed answer is more restrictive - it only allows certain specific primes (2 and 5) to have odd exponents
2. The ground truth allows any prime ≡1 mod4 to have odd exponents, but the proposed answer doesn't
3. The proposed answer doesn't account for cases where other primes ≡1 mod4 have odd exponents

Example where they differ:
- n = 13 (prime ≡1 mod4) is allowed by ground truth but not by proposed answer
- n = 2*3² = 18 is allowed by ground truth (exponent of 3 is even) but not by proposed answer
