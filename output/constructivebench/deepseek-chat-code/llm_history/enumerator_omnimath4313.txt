[write_program]
This problem is about finding for which grid sizes n×n there exists a Hamiltonian path (visiting each square exactly once with adjacent moves) where no two squares in the same column or row share the same remainder modulo n in their path positions.

We'll write a Python program to check small values of n and look for a pattern. The program will:
1. Try all possible Hamiltonian paths on small grids (n=1 to 5)
2. For each path, check the additional modulo condition
3. Output n values that satisfy the condition

```python
from itertools import permutations

def is_adjacent(p, q):
    """Check if two positions are adjacent (horizontally or vertically)"""
    return (p[0] == q[0] and abs(p[1] - q[1]) == 1) or (p[1] == q[1] and abs(p[0] - q[0]) == 1)

def check_condition(path, n):
    """Check the modulo condition for a given path"""
    for i in range(n*n):
        for j in range(i+1, n*n):
            if (i % n) == (j % n):
                if path[i][0] == path[j][0] or path[i][1] == path[j][1]:
                    return False
    return True

def find_valid_paths(n):
    """Try all possible Hamiltonian paths for n×n grid and check conditions"""
    grid = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(n)]
    
    # We'll use a backtracking approach to find Hamiltonian paths
    def backtrack(path, remaining):
        if not remaining:
            if check_condition(path, n):
                return True
            return False
        
        last = path[-1]
        for neighbor in remaining:
            if is_adjacent(last, neighbor):
                if backtrack(path + [neighbor], remaining - {neighbor}):
                    return True
        return False
    
    # Try starting from each position
    for start in grid:
        if backtrack([start], set(grid) - {start}):
            return True
    return False

# Check small values of n
for n in range(1, 6):
    if find_valid_paths(n):
        print(f"n = {n} satisfies the condition")
    else:
        print(f"n = {n} does not satisfy the condition")
```
