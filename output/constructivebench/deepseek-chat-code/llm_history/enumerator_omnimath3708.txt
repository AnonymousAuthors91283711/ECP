[write_program]
This problem asks for the greatest natural number x such that 23^(6+x) divides 2000!. We'll write a Python program to compute the exponent of 23 in the prime factorization of 2000! (Legendre's formula), then subtract 6 to find x.

The approach is:
1. Compute the exponent of 23 in 2000! using Legendre's formula: sum_{k=1}^âˆž floor(2000/23^k)
2. Subtract 6 to get x
3. Since we need the greatest x, we'll compute this directly

```python
def max_x():
    p = 23
    n = 2000
    exponent = 0
    power = p
    while power <= n:
        exponent += n // power
        power *= p
    x = exponent - 6
    print(f"Maximum x such that 23^(6+x) divides 2000!: {x}")

max_x()
```
