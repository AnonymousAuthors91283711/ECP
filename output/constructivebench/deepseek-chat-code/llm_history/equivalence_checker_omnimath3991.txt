Ground Truth Answer: 13/4
Proposed Answer: 5
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a system of equations with variables cake_price (x), cupcake_price (y), and bagel_price (z):
   - x + 2y + 3z = 3x + z
   - 3x + z = 6y
   - 2x + 2z = answer * y

2. Simplifying the first equation: x + 2y + 3z = 3x + z → 2y + 2z = 2x → y + z = x

3. Second equation: 3x + z = 6y

4. From y + z = x, we can substitute x in the second equation:
   3(y + z) + z = 6y → 3y + 3z + z = 6y → 4z = 3y → z = (3/4)y

5. Then x = y + z = y + (3/4)y = (7/4)y

6. Now plug into the third equation:
   2x + 2z = answer * y → 2(7/4)y + 2(3/4)y = answer * y → (14/4)y + (6/4)y = answer * y → (20/4)y = answer * y → 5y = answer * y → answer = 5 (when y ≠ 0)

The proposed answer is 5, which matches our derivation. The ground truth answer of 13/4 appears to be incorrect based on this calculation.
