[write_program]
This problem asks for the maximum rational number `r` such that there exists a non-zero rational `x` satisfying `a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0` for some positive integers `a,b,c` each ≤ 100. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible `(a,b,c)` triples and compute the maximum root.

The approach:
1. Iterate through all possible `(a,b,c)` triples with 1 ≤ a,b,c ≤ 100
2. For each valid quadratic equation, compute the roots
3. Track the maximum non-zero rational root found

```python
import fractions
from math import isqrt

max_root = None

for a in range(1, 101):
    for b in range(1, 101):
        for c in range(1, 101):
            # Compute discriminant
            discriminant = b*b - 4*a*c
            if discriminant < 0:
                continue  # No real roots
            
            # Compute square root of discriminant exactly if perfect square
            sqrt_disc = isqrt(discriminant)
            if sqrt_disc * sqrt_disc != discriminant:
                continue  # Roots are irrational, skip for rational requirement
            
            # Compute possible numerators and denominators
            for sign in [-1, 1]:
                numerator = -b + sign * sqrt_disc
                denominator = 2*a
                
                # Simplify fraction
                if numerator == 0:
                    continue  # Skip zero root
                
                root = fractions.Fraction(numerator, denominator)
                if max_root is None or root > max_root:
                    max_root = root
                    print(f"New max root: {root} from (a={a}, b={b}, c={c})")

print(f"\nFinal maximum rational root: {max_root}")
```
