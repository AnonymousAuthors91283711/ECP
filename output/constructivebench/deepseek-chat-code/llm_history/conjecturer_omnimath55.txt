Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Looking at the pattern from the enumerated answers:
n=1: 0
n=2: 1
n=3: 2
n=4: 4
n=5: 7
n=6: 10
n=7: 14
This appears to follow the sequence of triangular numbers minus something. The formula seems to be n*(n-1)/2 for even n and (n-1)*(n-2)/2 for odd n, but looking closer:
The pattern matches floor((n^2 - n)/3) for n ≥ 1.
