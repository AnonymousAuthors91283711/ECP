[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimum value obtained by applying the function f(x) = x² + 6x + 7 four times in succession (f(f(f(f(x))))). We'll write a Python program to compute this value numerically by finding the fixed point of the function and evaluating the 4th iteration at that point.

The approach is:
1. Find the fixed point of f(x) where f(x) = x
2. Since f is convex, the minimum of any iteration will occur at this fixed point
3. Compute f^4 at this fixed point

```python
def f(x):
    return x**2 + 6*x + 7

# Find fixed point of f(x) = x (x² + 5x + 7 = 0)
# Using quadratic formula
a, b, c = 1, 5, 7
discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
fixed_point = (-b - (discriminant)**0.5)/(2*a)  # Taking the smaller root

# Compute f^4 at fixed point
result = fixed_point
for _ in range(4):
    result = f(result)

print(f"Fixed point: {fixed_point}")
print(f"f^4 at fixed point: {result}")
```
