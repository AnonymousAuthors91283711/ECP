This problem involves counting the number of valid functions from Fin 7 to Fin 4 (7 days to 4 menu options) with two constraints:
1. No two consecutive days can have the same menu
2. The 6th day (index 5) must have menu option 0

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible valid sequences. The approach is to:
1. Generate all possible sequences of length 7 with values 0-3
2. Filter sequences where consecutive elements differ and the 6th element is 0
3. Count the valid sequences

```python
from itertools import product

def count_valid_sequences():
    count = 0
    # Generate all possible sequences of length 7 with values 0-3
    for seq in product(range(4), repeat=7):
        # Check if day 6 (index 5) is 0
        if seq[5] != 0:
            continue
        # Check no consecutive days have same menu
        valid = True
        for i in range(6):
            if seq[i] == seq[i+1]:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1
            print(seq)  # Print each valid sequence found
    return count

print("Counting valid sequences...")
total = count_valid_sequences()
print(f"Total valid sequences: {total}")
```
