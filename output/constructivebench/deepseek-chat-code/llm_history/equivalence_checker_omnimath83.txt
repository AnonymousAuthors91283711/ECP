Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n - 1 + sqrt (n - 1)) / sqrt n
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => sqrt n - sqrt (n - 1)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the least constant L such that a certain inequality holds for all real-valued sequences a of length n and all real numbers b.

2. The ground truth answer is (n - 1 + sqrt(n - 1))/sqrt(n)

3. The proposed answer is sqrt(n) - sqrt(n - 1)

Let's compare these two expressions:

For n = 2:
- Ground truth: (1 + sqrt(1))/sqrt(2) = 2/sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414
- Proposed: sqrt(2) - sqrt(1) ≈ 1.414 - 1 = 0.414

For n = 3:
- Ground truth: (2 + sqrt(2))/sqrt(3) ≈ (2 + 1.414)/1.732 ≈ 1.97
- Proposed: sqrt(3) - sqrt(2) ≈ 1.732 - 1.414 ≈ 0.318

The values are clearly different, and the proposed answer gives much smaller values than the ground truth. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth in any case.
