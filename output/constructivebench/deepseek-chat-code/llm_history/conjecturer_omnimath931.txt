abbrev omnimath931_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath931
(e f : ℝ)
(hfrac : e / f = 3 / 4)
(hsqrt : Real.sqrt (e ^ 2 + f ^ 2) = 15)
: e * f = omnimath931_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: e = 9.0, f = 12, e*f = 108.0
e = -9.0, f = -12, e*f = 108.0
For positive values:
Final answer (e*f): 108. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<108>>>
