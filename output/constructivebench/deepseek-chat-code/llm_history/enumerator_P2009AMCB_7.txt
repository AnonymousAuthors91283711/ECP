The problem involves finding the value of x (rounded to the nearest integer) that satisfies the given equation for any positive P. The equation simplifies to a condition independent of P, so we can solve for x directly. We'll enumerate possible integer values of x between 0 and 100 to find the one that satisfies the equation.

```python
def solve():
    # The equation simplifies to: (1.2 * 0.8 * 1.25) * (1 - x/100) = 1
    # Calculating the constant part: 1.2 * 0.8 * 1.25 = 1.2
    # So the equation becomes: 1.2 * (1 - x/100) = 1
    # Which simplifies to: 1 - x/100 = 1/1.2
    # Then: x/100 = 1 - 1/1.2 = 0.2/1.2 = 1/6
    # Therefore: x = 100/6 â‰ˆ 16.666...
    
    # Exact solution would be x = 100/6, but we need to find the rounded integer
    exact_x = 100 / 6
    rounded_x = round(exact_x)
    print(f"Exact solution: x = {exact_x}")
    print(f"Rounded solution: x = {rounded_x}")
