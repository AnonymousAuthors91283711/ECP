Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence a(n) with:
   - Base cases: a(1)=1, a(9)=7
   - Recursive relation for n≥2: a(n+1) = [a(n)² - a(n-1) + 2a(n)]/[a(n-1) + 1]

2. We're asked to find a(5)

3. Let's compute the sequence step by step:
   - a(1) = 1 (given)
   - For n=1: a(2) = [a(1)² - a(0) + 2a(1)]/[a(0) + 1] → but a(0) is undefined
   - The problem seems to have an issue here since a(0) is needed but not defined

However, if we assume the recursion starts from n=2 (using a(1) and a(2)), we can proceed if we can find a(2). But the problem doesn't provide enough information to determine a(2).

Given this, neither answer (2 or 3) can be definitively verified as correct based on the given information. The problem appears to be missing some initial conditions.
