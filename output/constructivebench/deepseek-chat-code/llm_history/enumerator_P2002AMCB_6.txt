[write_program]
This problem asks for all pairs of real numbers (a, b) where both a and b are roots of the quadratic equation x² + a x + b = 0, with a ≠ 0 and b ≠ 0. We'll enumerate possible solutions by solving the system of equations derived from substituting a and b into the polynomial.

The approach:
1. Substitute x = a and x = b into x² + a x + b = 0 to get two equations
2. Solve the system of equations for a and b
3. Filter out solutions where a = 0 or b = 0
4. Output all valid pairs

```python
import math

def find_solutions():
    # We'll search for solutions (a, b) where both are roots of x² + a x + b = 0
    # This gives us two equations:
    # 1) a² + a*a + b = 0 → 2a² + b = 0
    # 2) b² + a*b + b = 0 → b(b + a + 1) = 0
    # Since b ≠ 0, we have b + a + 1 = 0 → b = -a - 1
    # Substitute into first equation: 2a² - a - 1 = 0
    # Solve quadratic: a = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 8)]/4 → a = [1 ± 3]/4
    # So a = 1 or a = -0.5
    
    # Case 1: a = 1
    a1 = 1.0
    b1 = -a1 - 1
    print(f"Solution found: ({a1}, {b1})")
    
    # Case 2: a = -0.5
    a2 = -0.5
    b2 = -a2 - 1
    print(f"Solution found: ({a2}, {b2})")

    # Verify these are indeed solutions
    def is_root(x, a, b):
        return abs(x**2 + a*x + b) < 1e-9
    
    for (a, b) in [(a1, b1), (a2, b2)]:
        if is_root(a, a, b) and is_root(b, a, b) and a != 0 and b != 0:
            print(f"Verified solution: ({a}, {b})")
