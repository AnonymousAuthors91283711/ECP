[write_program]
This problem involves finding all real-valued functions f: ℝ → ℝ that satisfy two conditions:
1. The zero set {x | f(x)=0} has finite cardinality
2. The functional equation f(x⁴ + y) = x³f(x) + f(f(y)) for all x,y ∈ ℝ

We'll write a Python program to enumerate polynomial solutions (since they're easier to handle computationally) and check the functional equation. We'll focus on low-degree polynomials first.

```python
import numpy as np
from itertools import product

def check_functional_eq(f_coeffs, x, y):
    """Check if the functional equation holds for given coefficients at (x,y)"""
    # Evaluate f(x⁴ + y)
    lhs = np.polyval(f_coeffs, x**4 + y)
    
    # Evaluate x³f(x) + f(f(y))
    fx = np.polyval(f_coeffs, x)
    fy = np.polyval(f_coeffs, y)
    ffy = np.polyval(f_coeffs, fy)
    rhs = x**3 * fx + ffy
    
    return np.isclose(lhs, rhs, atol=1e-6)

def test_polynomial(degree):
    """Test all polynomials up to given degree"""
    print(f"\nTesting degree {degree} polynomials...")
    found = False
    
    # We'll test coefficients from -3 to 3 for simplicity
    for coeffs in product(range(-3, 4), repeat=degree+1):
        if coeffs[-1] == 0:  # Skip if not actually this degree
            continue
            
        f_coeffs = list(coeffs)
        valid = True
        
        # Test random points to filter out candidates
        for _ in range(10):
            x, y = np.random.uniform(-2, 2), np.random.uniform(-2, 2)
            if not check_functional_eq(f_coeffs, x, y):
                valid = False
                break
                
        if valid:
            # Verify more thoroughly
            thorough = True
            for x, y in product(np.linspace(-1, 1, 3), repeat=2):
                if not check_functional_eq(f_coeffs, x, y):
                    thorough = False
                    break
                    
            if thorough:
                print(f"Found candidate: f(x) = {np.poly1d(f_coeffs)}")
                found = True
                
    if not found:
        print(f"No valid degree {degree} polynomials found")

# Test polynomials up to degree 4
for degree in range(5):
    test_polynomial(degree)
```
