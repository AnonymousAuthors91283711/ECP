This problem appears to be a Diophantine equation where we need to find a natural number `omnimath2937_answer` that satisfies the given equation. The equation simplifies to finding when two products of integers are equal. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible integer solutions by simplifying the equation and checking possible values.

The equation given is:
3 * 3 * 5 * 5 * 7 * 9 = 3 * 3 * 7 * x * x

First, we'll simplify both sides by canceling common factors (3*3*7 from both sides):
5 * 5 * 9 = x * x
225 = x²

Thus, we're looking for integer solutions to x² = 225. The program will simply compute this and output the positive solution.

```python
# The equation simplifies to x² = 225, so we're looking for x where x is a positive integer
# We'll compute the square root and verify it's an integer
import math

x_squared = 225
x = int(math.isqrt(x_squared))
if x * x == x_squared:
    print(x)
else:
    print("No integer solution found")
```
