abbrev omnimath892_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath892 :
  (∑ k in Finset.Icc 0 100, (Int.floor ((2 ^ 100 : ℝ) / (2 ^ 50 + 2 ^ k))) = omnimath892_answer) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 101 * 2 ^ 49 - 50
Proposed Answer: 2^100 - 2^50
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves summing floor functions of the form floor(2¹⁰⁰/(2⁵⁰ + 2ᵏ)) for k from 0 to 100.

2. The ground truth answer is 101 * 2⁴⁹ - 50.

3. The proposed answer is 2¹⁰⁰ - 2⁵⁰.

Let's compare these:
- 101 * 2⁴⁹ = 101 * 562949953421312 ≈ 5.6858 × 10¹⁶
- 2¹⁰⁰ = 1267650600228229401496703205376 ≈ 1.2677 × 10³⁰
- The proposed answer is many orders of magnitude larger than the ground truth answer.

The proposed answer doesn't make sense because:
- Each term in the sum is floor(2¹⁰⁰/(2⁵⁰ + 2ᵏ)) ≤ floor(2¹⁰⁰/2⁵⁰) = 2⁵⁰
- There are 101 terms, so the maximum possible sum would be 101 * 2⁵⁰ ≈ 1.136 × 10¹⁷
- The proposed answer 2¹⁰⁰ - 2⁵⁰ is much larger than this maximum possible sum.
