This problem involves finding the product \(xy\) given the equation \(x + \frac{2}{x} = y + \frac{2}{y}\) with \(x \neq 0\), \(y \neq 0\), and \(x \neq y\). We'll solve it by algebraic manipulation and enumeration of possible values.

1. Start with the given equation: \(x + \frac{2}{x} = y + \frac{2}{y}\)
2. Rearrange terms: \(x - y = \frac{2}{y} - \frac{2}{x}\)
3. Factor right side: \(x - y = 2\left(\frac{x - y}{xy}\right)\)
4. Since \(x \neq y\), we can divide both sides by \(x - y\): \(1 = \frac{2}{xy}\)
5. Thus, \(xy = 2\)

The program will verify this by testing random non-zero, distinct pairs \((x, y)\) that satisfy the original equation.

```python
import random

def verify_xy_product():
    # Test 5 random cases
    for _ in range(5):
        while True:
            x = random.uniform(-10, 10)
            if abs(x) > 0.1:  # Ensure x ≠ 0
                break
        # Compute y that satisfies x + 2/x = y + 2/y, y ≠ x
        # From algebra, y = 2/x is one solution (other is y = x which we exclude)
        y = 2 / x
        if abs(y - x) < 1e-6:  # Skip if y ≈ x
            continue
        # Verify equation holds
        lhs = x + 2/x
        rhs = y + 2/y
        if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-6:
            print(f"x={x:.3f}, y={y:.3f}, product xy={x*y:.3f}")
