This problem asks for the smallest natural number `n` such that `n * (1/3) > 10 * (1/2)`. We can simplify the inequality to `n > 15`. The smallest integer satisfying this is 16. Here's a Python program to verify this by enumerating possible values:

```python
def find_min_n():
    # The inequality simplifies to n > 15, so we check values around this threshold
    for n in range(10, 20):  # Check a reasonable range around the expected answer
        if n * (1/3) > 10 * (1/2):
            print(f"Found candidate: {n}")
            # Since we're looking for the smallest n, we can stop after first match
            print(f"Minimum n satisfying the inequality: {n}")
            return
    print("No solution found in the tested range")

find_min_n()
```
