This problem involves finding complex pairs (a, b) that satisfy a system of equations. We'll approach it by:
1. Converting to real variables (a = x+iy, b = u+iv)
2. Enumerating possible real solutions
3. Checking small integer values first

Here's a Python program that searches for solutions by testing rational candidates:

```python
import math

def find_solutions():
    # Search range for numerators and denominators
    max_num = 10
    max_den = 5
    
    found = set()
    
    # Iterate through possible rational components
    for x_num in range(-max_num, max_num+1):
        for x_den in range(1, max_den+1):
            x = x_num / x_den
            for u_num in range(-max_num, max_num+1):
                for u_den in range(1, max_den+1):
                    u = u_num / u_den
                    for y_num in range(-max_num, max_num+1):
                        for y_den in range(1, max_den+1):
                            y = y_num / y_den
                            for v_num in range(-max_num, max_num+1):
                                for v_den in range(1, max_den+1):
                                    v = v_num / v_den
                                    
                                    a = complex(x, y)
                                    b = complex(u, v)
                                    denom = a**2 + b**2
                                    
                                    if abs(denom) < 1e-10:
                                        continue
                                    
                                    eq1 = a + 10*b/denom - 5
                                    eq2 = b + 10*a/denom - 4
                                    
                                    if abs(eq1) < 1e-6 and abs(eq2) < 1e-6:
                                        sol = (a, b)
                                        if sol not in found:
                                            found.add(sol)
                                            print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}")

    if not found:
        print("No solutions found in search range")

find_solutions()
```

Note: The program searches for solutions with small rational components. For complex problems like this, exact symbolic solutions might be better found using computer algebra systems, but this enumerative approach can help identify patterns or exact solutions when they exist within the search space.
