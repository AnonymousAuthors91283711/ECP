[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of natural number pairs (x, y) where 0 ≤ x ≤ y and 5x² - 4xy + 2x + y² = 624. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all valid (x, y) pairs satisfying these conditions.

The approach is:
1. Iterate x from 0 upwards until 5x² exceeds 624
2. For each x, solve the quadratic equation for y
3. Check if the solutions are natural numbers and satisfy x ≤ y

```python
def solve():
    target = 624
    solutions = []
    
    # Iterate x from 0 upwards until 5x^2 exceeds target
    x = 0
    while True:
        term = 5 * x * x
        if term > target:
            break
        
        # Coefficients of quadratic in y: y^2 -4xy + (5x^2 + 2x - 624) = 0
        a = 1
        b = -4 * x
        c = 5 * x * x + 2 * x - target
        
        discriminant = b * b - 4 * a * c
        if discriminant < 0:
            x += 1
            continue
            
        sqrt_discriminant = int(discriminant ** 0.5)
        if sqrt_discriminant * sqrt_discriminant != discriminant:
            x += 1
            continue
            
        y1 = (-b + sqrt_discriminant) // (2 * a)
        y2 = (-b - sqrt_discriminant) // (2 * a)
        
        for y in [y1, y2]:
            if y >= x and 5 * x * x - 4 * x * y + 2 * x + y * y == target:
                solutions.append((x, y))
                print(f"Found solution: ({x}, {y})")
        
        x += 1
    
    print(f"Total number of solutions: {len(solutions)}")

solve()
```
