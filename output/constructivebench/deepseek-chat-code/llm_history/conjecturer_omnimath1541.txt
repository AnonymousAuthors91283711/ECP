: IsGreatest
    {y : ℝ | ∃ x > 0, y = Real.sin (Real.arctan (x / 9) - Real.arctan (x / 16))}
    omnimath1541_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: y at x≈0: 4.861111110716099e-06
y at x=12: 0.27999999999999997
y at x→∞: 6.9999999988205e-06

Maximum value is: 0.27999999999999997. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<7 / 25>>> 

Explanation: The maximum value occurs at x=12, yielding y≈0.28 which equals 7/25. The pattern from enumerated values suggests this simple fraction as the closed-form solution. The other values at x→0 and x→∞ approach 0, confirming 7/25 as the global maximum.
