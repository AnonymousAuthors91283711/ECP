[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest divisor d that appears immediately after 323 in the sorted list of divisors of some even 4-digit number n divisible by 323. We'll write a Python program to:

1. Generate all even 4-digit numbers divisible by 323
2. For each such number, find its sorted divisors
3. Check where 323 appears in the divisor list
4. Track the smallest d that appears right after 323 in any such list

```python
import math

def get_sorted_divisors(n):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(n // i)
    return sorted(divisors)

min_d = None

for n in range(1000, 10000):
    if n % 2 == 0 and n % 323 == 0:
        divisors = get_sorted_divisors(n)
        try:
            k = divisors.index(323)
            if k + 1 < len(divisors):
                d = divisors[k+1]
                print(f"n={n}, d={d}")
                if min_d is None or d < min_d:
                    min_d = d
        except ValueError:
            continue

print(f"Minimum d found: {min_d}")
```
