This problem involves finding the volume of a set P defined by certain conditions on functions from Fin 3 → ℝ (essentially ℝ³ vectors). The conditions are:
1. Each component is between -1 and 1
2. The sum of absolute values condition holds

We'll approach this by:
1. Enumerating all possible sign patterns for the components
2. For each pattern, solving the resulting linear equations
3. Calculating the volume contribution from each case

```python
import itertools
import numpy as np

def calculate_volume():
    # Enumerate all possible sign combinations for f0, f1, f2, and their sum
    signs = [-1, 1]
    total_volume = 0.0
    
    # Iterate through all possible sign combinations (8 for f0,f1,f2)
    for s0, s1, s2 in itertools.product(signs, signs, signs):
        sum_sign = np.sign(s0 + s1 + s2)
        if sum_sign == 0:
            sum_sign = 1  # arbitrary choice when sum is zero
            
        # The equation becomes linear with these signs
        # |f0| + |f1| + |f2| + |f0+f1+f2| = |f0+f1| + |f1+f2| + |f2+f0|
        # With signs fixed, becomes:
        # s0*f0 + s1*f1 + s2*f2 + sum_sign*(f0+f1+f2) = 
        #   |s0*f0 + s1*f1| + |s1*f1 + s2*f2| + |s2*f2 + s0*f0|
        
        # We need to find the region where this holds
        # This is complex, so we'll sample points to estimate volume
        
        # Sample points in [-1,1]^3 and check condition
        sample_count = 100000
        count = 0
        for _ in range(sample_count):
            f0, f1, f2 = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, 3)
            lhs = abs(f0) + abs(f1) + abs(f2) + abs(f0 + f1 + f2)
            rhs = abs(f0 + f1) + abs(f1 + f2) + abs(f2 + f0)
            if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-6:
                count += 1
        volume_estimate = (count / sample_count) * 8  # 8 is volume of [-1,1]^3
        print(f"Signs ({s0},{s1},{s2}): estimated volume {volume_estimate}")
        total_volume += volume_estimate
    
    print(f"Total estimated volume: {total_volume}")

calculate_volume()
```
