This problem involves finding all real numbers x between 100 and 200 degrees that satisfy a trigonometric equation, then summing them. The equation involves cubes of cosine functions with different arguments. We'll write a Python program to numerically search for solutions in this range.

The approach:
1. Convert degrees to radians for trigonometric functions
2. Define the equation to check
3. Scan through the range [100,200] with small increments
4. Check for values where the equation holds approximately (within a tolerance)
5. Collect and sum the valid solutions

```python
import math

def main():
    solutions = []
    # Scan from 100 to 200 degrees in small steps
    for x_deg in range(10000, 20001):  # 100.00 to 200.00 in 0.01 degree steps
        x = x_deg / 100.0
        x_rad = math.radians(x)
        
        # Compute all required cosine terms
        cos3x = math.cos(3 * x_rad)
        cos5x = math.cos(5 * x_rad)
        cos4x = math.cos(4 * x_rad)
        cosx = math.cos(x_rad)
        
        # Left and right sides of equation
        lhs = cos3x**3 + cos5x**3
        rhs = 8 * (cos4x**3) * (cosx**3)
        
        # Check if equation holds within tolerance
        if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-8:
            solutions.append(x)
            print(f"Found solution: {x:.2f} degrees")
    
    if solutions:
        total = sum(solutions)
        print(f"\nSum of solutions: {total:.2f}")
    else:
        print("No solutions found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
