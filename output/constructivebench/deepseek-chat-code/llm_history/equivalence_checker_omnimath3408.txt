Ground Truth Answer: 7 * 2023
Proposed Answer: 119^2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest positive natural number n that is:
   - A perfect square (n = k² for some k)
   - Divisible by 2023

2. Ground Truth Answer: 7 × 2023 = 14161
3. Proposed Answer: 119² = 14161

First, let's verify:
- 119² = 14161
- 2023 × 7 = 14161
- 2023 factors into 7 × 17 × 17
- 119 factors into 7 × 17
- Therefore, 119² = 7² × 17² = 7 × (7 × 17 × 17) = 7 × 2023

Both answers give the same numerical value (14161) and satisfy the problem's conditions. The proposed answer presents it as a square (119²) while the ground truth presents it as 7 × 2023, but they are mathematically equivalent.
