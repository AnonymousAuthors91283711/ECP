. Enumerated Answers: x1 = -3, x2 = 3/2
|x1 - x2| = 9/2. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The error occurs because Lean expects proper line breaks or semicolons between declarations. The proposed answer is correct mathematically (9/2 is indeed the distance between -3 and 3/2), but the syntax needs fixing. Here's the corrected version:

<<<9/2>>>

Explanation:
1. The distance between two points x1 and x2 is |x1 - x2|
2. Given x1 = -3 and x2 = 3/2
3. Calculation: |-3 - (3/2)| = |-9/2| = 9/2
4. The enumerated answers confirm this result
5. The error was purely syntactic (missing line breaks), not mathematical

The answer is simply the real number 9/2, which represents the absolute difference between -3 and 3/2. The mathematical content was correct in the original proposal, it just needed proper Lean syntax formatting.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
