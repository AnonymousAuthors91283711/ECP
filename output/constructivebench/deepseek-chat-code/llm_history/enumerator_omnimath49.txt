[write_program]
This problem involves finding minimal values for certain norms of complex sequences with specific constraints. We'll write a Python program to enumerate small cases (n=1,2,3,4) to help identify patterns.

Key observations:
1. Odd-indexed terms are real, even-indexed terms are purely imaginary
2. The product condition |z_k * z_{k+1}| = 2^k must hold
3. We need to find minimal norms of partial sums and their products

        # Each term is either real (odd) or imaginary (even)
        # We'll represent them as (real_part, imag_part)
        # Initialize with first term (k=1, odd, real)
        sequences = [[(1.0, 0.0)]]  # Start with z1 = 1
