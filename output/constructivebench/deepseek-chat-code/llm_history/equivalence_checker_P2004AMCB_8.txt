theorem P2004AMCB_8 (n : ℕ) (h : n = 100) : 
  IsLeast {k : ℕ | Finset.sum (Finset.range k) (fun i => 2 * i + 1) = n} (P2004AMCB_8_answer n) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => Int.toNat ⌊(Real.sqrt (1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2⌋
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => Nat.sqrt n + (if n % (Nat.sqrt n)^2 = 0 then 0 else 1)
Let me analyze the problem and the two answers:

Problem Analysis:
We need to find the smallest k such that the sum of the first k odd numbers equals n. The sum of first k odd numbers is known to be k², so we're essentially looking for the smallest k where k² ≥ n. This is equivalent to finding the ceiling of the square root of n.

Ground Truth Answer:
The ground truth uses the formula derived from solving k² + k - 2n = 0 (from sum of arithmetic series), giving k = (√(1+8n)-1)/2. This correctly finds the smallest k where the sum exceeds n.

Proposed Answer:
The proposed answer uses Nat.sqrt n (integer square root) and adds 1 unless n is a perfect square. This is actually equivalent to finding the ceiling of the square root of n.

Equivalence:
While the formulas look different, they are mathematically equivalent for all natural numbers n:
- For perfect squares n=m², both give m
- For non-perfect squares, both give ⌈√n⌉
The ground truth formula simplifies to the same result through different algebraic manipulation.
