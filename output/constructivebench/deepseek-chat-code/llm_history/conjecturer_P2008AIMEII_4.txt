theorem P2008AIMEII_4 :
  ∃ (r : ℕ) (ns : List ℕ) (as : List ℤ),
    Sorted (· > ·) ns ∧
    Nodup ns ∧
    Nodup as ∧
    as.length = r ∧
    ns.length = r ∧
    (∀ a ∈ as, a = 1 ∨ a = -1) ∧
    (∑ i in Finset.range r, (as.get! i) * 2^(ns.get! i)) = 2008 ∧
    ns.sum = P2008AIMEII_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Standard binary: exponents [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 3], sum=47
