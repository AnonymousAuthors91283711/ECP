Ground Truth Answer: ∅
Proposed Answer: {(2, -2), (-2, 2), (0, 0)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all integer pairs (m,n) that satisfy m⁵ - n⁵ = 16mn.

2. The ground truth answer is the empty set (∅), meaning there are no integer solutions.

3. The proposed answer suggests three pairs: (2,-2), (-2,2), and (0,0).

Let's test the proposed solutions:
- For (0,0): 0⁵ - 0⁵ = 0 = 16*0*0 → valid
- For (2,-2): 2⁵ - (-2)⁵ = 32 - (-32) = 64 = 16*2*(-2) = -64 → invalid
- For (-2,2): (-2)⁵ - 2⁵ = -32 - 32 = -64 = 16*(-2)*2 = -64 → valid

The proposed answer contains one invalid pair (2,-2) and misses that (0,0) is actually valid. The ground truth claims no solutions exist, which is incorrect since (0,0) and (-2,2) are solutions.
