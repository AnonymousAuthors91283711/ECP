This problem involves finding Charlie's birth year between 1900 and 1999 such that in 2014, his age equals twice the last two digits of his birth year. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible birth years in this range and check the condition.

```python
def solve():
    for year in range(1900, 2000):
        age_in_2014 = 2014 - year
        last_two_digits = year % 100
        if age_in_2014 == 2 * last_two_digits:
            print(year)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```
