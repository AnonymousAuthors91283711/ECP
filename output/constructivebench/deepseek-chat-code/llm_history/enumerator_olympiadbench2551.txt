This problem involves solving a trigonometric equation to find the value of sin(2x) given certain conditions. We'll write a Python program to numerically explore possible solutions within the given range (0 < x < π/2) and find the corresponding sin(2x) values that satisfy the equation cos(3/2 * cos(x)) = sin(3/2 * sin(x)).

The approach will be:
1. Sample x values in the interval (0, π/2)
2. For each x, check if the equation holds within a small tolerance
3. When a solution is found, compute and print sin(2x)

```python
import math

def find_solutions():
    # We'll sample 10000 points in the interval (0, π/2)
    samples = 10000
    tolerance = 1e-8
    for i in range(1, samples):
        x = (math.pi/2) * i / samples
        lhs = math.cos(1.5 * math.cos(x))
        rhs = math.sin(1.5 * math.sin(x))
        if abs(lhs - rhs) < tolerance:
            sin2x = math.sin(2 * x)
            print(f"x = {x:.6f}, sin(2x) = {sin2x:.15f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solutions()
```
[refine_program]
Let me analyze this problem and the provided program:

Judgement:
1. The problem asks to find x in (0, π/2) where cos(3/2 cos x) = sin(3/2 sin x), then compute sin(2x) for those x values.
2. The program attempts to find solutions by brute-force sampling 10000 points, but fails to find any (empty output).
3. The issue is likely due to:
   - Insufficient sampling resolution (10000 points might miss the solution)
   - Too strict tolerance (1e-8 might be too tight)
   - The solution might require more sophisticated root-finding

The program is rejected because it fails to find any solutions. We should improve it by:
1. Increasing the sampling resolution
2. Using a more appropriate tolerance
3. Adding a verification step to ensure we find the solution
4. Making the output more precise

<<<False>>>

Here's the corrected program:

```python
import math
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import bisect

def equation(x):
    return math.cos(1.5 * math.cos(x)) - math.sin(1.5 * math.sin(x))

def find_solutions():
    # First try to find a solution using bisection method
    try:
        x_sol = bisect(equation, 0.1, math.pi/2 - 0.1, xtol=1e-12)
        sin2x = math.sin(2 * x_sol)
        print(f"Solution found:")
        print(f"x = {x_sol:.15f}")
        print(f"sin(2x) = {sin2x:.15f}")
    except ValueError:
        print("No solution found in the interval")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solutions()
```

This improved version:
1. Uses scipy's bisection method for more reliable root-finding
2. Has better numerical precision (1e-12 tolerance)
3. Provides more accurate output formatting
4. Handles the case where no solution is found
5. Still maintains the requirement of printing exact values (not True/False)
