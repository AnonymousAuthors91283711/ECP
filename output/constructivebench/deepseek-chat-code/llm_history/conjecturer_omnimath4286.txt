abbrev omnimath4286_answer : Set (ℤ × ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath4286 (x : ℤ) (y : ℕ) : 
    x^2 * (1 + x^2) = -1 + 21^y ↔ (x, y) ∈ omnimath4286_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (x, y) = (0, 0)
(x, y) = (0, 0)
(x, y) = (2, 1)
(x, y) = (-2, 1). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℕ)
<<<{(0, 0), (2, 1), (-2, 1)}>>>
