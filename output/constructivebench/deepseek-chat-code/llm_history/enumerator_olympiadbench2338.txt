[write_program]
The problem asks to find all real numbers x that satisfy the equation (xÂ² + x + 4)/(2x + 1) = 4/x. We'll write a Python program to find these solutions numerically and symbolically.

Key steps:
1. Cross-multiply to eliminate denominators
2. Solve the resulting polynomial equation
3. Check for extraneous solutions (where denominators become zero)
4. Output valid solutions

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational

def find_solutions():
    x = symbols('x')
    # Original equation: (x^2 + x + 4)/(2x + 1) = 4/x
    # Cross-multiplied form: x(x^2 + x + 4) = 4(2x + 1)
    equation = Eq(x*(x**2 + x + 4), 4*(2*x + 1))
    
    # Solve the equation symbolically
    solutions = solve(equation, x)
    
    # Check for extraneous solutions (denominators zero)
    valid_solutions = []
    for sol in solutions:
        # Check if denominators are non-zero
        if sol != -Rational(1, 2) and sol != 0:
            valid_solutions.append(sol)
    
    # Print all valid solutions
    print("Valid solutions:")
    for sol in valid_solutions:
        print(f"x = {sol}")

    # Exact form output
    print("\nExact forms:")
    for sol in valid_solutions:
        print(f"x = {sol.evalf(10)} (approximation)")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solutions()
```
