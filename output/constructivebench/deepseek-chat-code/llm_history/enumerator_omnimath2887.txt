[write_program]
This problem involves solving for T in the equation 13 + (T - 20)/4 = T where T > 20. We'll write a Python program to find integer solutions to this equation for T values up to a reasonable threshold (100 in this case).

The approach is to:
1. Iterate through possible T values from 21 to 100
2. Check if the equation holds for each T
3. Print any valid solutions found

```python
def solve_equation():
    print("Searching for solutions to 13 + (T - 20)/4 = T where T > 20")
    for T in range(21, 101):
        if (T - 20) % 4 != 0:  # Ensure division is exact
            continue
        left_side = 13 + (T - 20) // 4
        if left_side == T:
            print(f"Found solution: T = {T}")

solve_equation()
```
