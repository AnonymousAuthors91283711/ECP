[write_program]
This problem asks for all triples (a, b, c) of integers where 1 < a < b < c and (a-1)(b-1)(c-1) divides (a*b*c - 1). We'll write a Python program to enumerate such triples up to a reasonable limit to help identify patterns.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible a values starting from 2
2. For each a, iterate b from a+1 up to a limit
3. For each (a,b), iterate c from b+1 up to a limit
4. Check the divisibility condition
5. Print valid triples as they're found

```python
def find_triples(max_a=10, max_b=100, max_c=1000):
    for a in range(2, max_a + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, max_b + 1):
            denominator = (a - 1) * (b - 1)
            # We can optimize by noting that c must satisfy:
            # (denominator*(c-1)) divides (a*b*c - 1)
            # So we can find possible c values that satisfy this
            for c in range(b + 1, max_c + 1):
                numerator = a * b * c - 1
                denom_part = (c - 1)
                if denom_part == 0:
                    continue
                full_denominator = denominator * denom_part
                if full_denominator == 0:
                    continue
                if numerator % full_denominator == 0:
                    print(f"Found triple: ({a}, {b}, {c})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Searching for triples (a,b,c) where 1<a<b<c and (a-1)(b-1)(c-1)|(abc-1)")
    find_triples()
```
