Ground Truth Answer: { (a, b) | a = b ∨ ∃ k : ℕ, a - b = 2^k ∨ b - a = 2^k }
Proposed Answer: {p : ℕ × ℕ | p.1 = p.2}
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is about pairs of natural numbers (a,b) where there exists a gcd g and threshold N such that for all n ≥ N, gcd(aⁿ + b, bⁿ + a) = g.

The ground truth answer says this holds when:
1. a = b, OR
2. The absolute difference between a and b is a power of 2 (|a-b| = 2ᵏ for some k)

The proposed answer only includes the case where a = b, completely missing the second condition about powers of 2.

Therefore, the proposed answer is incomplete and incorrect for cases where |a-b| is a power of 2 but a ≠ b.
