The problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that there exists a set of n positive integers where the product of (1 - 1/i) for all i in the set equals 51/2010. We need to enumerate possible sets and find the minimal n that satisfies this condition.

Approach:
1. Factorize the target fraction: 51/2010 = (3×17)/(2×3×5×67) = 17/(2×5×67)
2. The product (1-1/i) can be written as ((i-1)/i), so the product becomes a telescoping product where most terms cancel out
3. We need to find a sequence where the numerator product is 17 and denominator product is 2×5×67
4. Enumerate possible factorizations by trying different combinations of integers

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def find_min_n():
    target = Fraction(51, 2010)
    min_n = float('inf')
    
    # We'll try sets up to size 10 (can be increased if needed)
    for n in range(1, 11):
        # Generate all combinations of n distinct integers > 1
        # Since 1 would make the product term 0, we skip 1
        from itertools import combinations
        
        # We'll limit the maximum integer to try for efficiency
        max_i = 100
        nums = range(2, max_i + 1)
        
        for combo in combinations(nums, n):
            product = Fraction(1, 1)
            for i in combo:
                product *= Fraction(i-1, i)
                # Early exit if product gets too small
                if product < target:
                    break
            
            if product == target:
                print(f"Found solution with n={n}: {combo}")
                if n < min_n:
                    min_n = n
    
    if min_n != float('inf'):
        print(f"Minimal n found: {min_n}")
    else:
        print("No solution found in search space")

find_min_n()
```
