This problem asks for the minimum possible sum of an 8x8 matrix where each entry M[i][j] is at least the maximum of (i+1) and (j+1). We'll enumerate possible matrices to find the minimal sum.

The minimal sum occurs when each M[i][j] equals max(i+1,j+1). We'll compute this sum directly.

```python
def compute_min_sum(n=8):
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            total += max(i+1, j+1)
    return total

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 8
    min_sum = compute_min_sum(n)
    print(f"For n={n}, the minimal sum is {min_sum}")
```
