This problem asks for the number of positive divisors of `20^4 * 11^5` that are perfect cubes. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such divisors by:
1. Factorizing the number (20^4 * 11^5)
2. Generating all possible combinations of exponents in the prime factorization that result in cube divisors
3. Counting these valid combinations

The prime factorization of 20^4 * 11^5 is (2^2 * 5)^4 * 11^5 = 2^8 * 5^4 * 11^5. For a divisor to be a perfect cube, each exponent in its prime factorization must be divisible by 3.

```python
def count_cube_divisors():
    # Prime factorization exponents: 2^8 * 5^4 * 11^5
    max_exp_2 = 8
    max_exp_5 = 4
    max_exp_11 = 5
    
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through all possible exponents divisible by 3 for each prime
    for exp_2 in range(0, max_exp_1 + 1, 3):
        for exp_5 in range(0, max_exp_5 + 1, 3):
            for exp_11 in range(0, max_exp_11 + 1, 3):
                count += 1
                # Print each valid combination (optional)
                print(f"2^{exp_2} * 5^{exp_5} * 11^{exp_11}")
    
    print(f"Total cube divisors: {count}")

count_cube_divisors()
```
[refine_program]
Judgement:
1. The program has a typo in `max_exp_1` which should be `max_exp_2`, causing it to fail.
2. The problem requires counting cube divisors of 20^4 * 11^5 (since T=5), which factors to 2^8 * 5^4 * 11^5.
3. The approach of iterating exponents divisible by 3 is correct, but the implementation is broken.
4. The program should count all combinations where exponents of each prime are multiples of 3 and within bounds.
5. The output should show both the combinations and final count.

The original program is rejected due to the typo and incomplete output.
