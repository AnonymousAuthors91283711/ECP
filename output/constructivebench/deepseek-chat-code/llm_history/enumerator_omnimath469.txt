[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimal sum x + y where x and y are positive integers satisfying the Pell-like equation x² - 29y² = 1. We'll write a Python program to find the smallest such solution.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible y values starting from 1
2. For each y, compute x² = 1 + 29y²
3. Check if x² is a perfect square
4. The first solution found will give the minimal sum since we're checking in order

```python
import math

def find_minimal_solution():
    y = 1
    while True:
        x_squared = 1 + 29 * y * y
        x = int(math.isqrt(x_squared))
        if x * x == x_squared:
            print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}, sum={x+y}")
            print(f"Minimal sum is {x+y}")
            return
        y += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_minimal_solution()
```
