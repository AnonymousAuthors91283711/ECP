From the enumerated answers, we observe that valid functions satisfy f(2) = f(1) + k where k ∈ {0,1,2,3,4}. The recurrence relation suggests solutions of form f(n) = a + b*2^n. The condition f(2010) ≤ 2^2012 restricts b to 0 or 1. When b=0, f(n)=a (constant), and when b=1, f(n)=2^n + (a-1). The initial conditions give us 5 possible constant functions (a=1..5) and 5 possible non-constant functions (a=1..5).
