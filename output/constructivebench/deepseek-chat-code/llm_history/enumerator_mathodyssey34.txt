This problem asks for the greatest natural number k such that 1991^k divides (1990^19911992 + 1992^19911990). To approach this computationally, we'll:

1. Simplify the problem by using smaller parameters first
2. Observe patterns in the exponents
3. Implement an efficient check for divisibility by powers of 1991

We'll start with smaller numbers to understand the pattern before attempting the large exponents.

```python
def compute_max_k(a, b, m, n1, n2):
    """
    Finds max k where (a*b)^k divides (a^m + b^n) where:
    a^m + b^n = (a*b)^k * t
    We use a=10, b=11, m=1112, n=1110 as smaller test cases
    """
    target = a**m + b**n2
    base = a * b
    k = 0
    while True:
        if target % (base**(k+1)) == 0:
            k += 1
        else:
            break
    return k

# Test with smaller numbers first
print("Testing with smaller parameters:")
a, b = 10, 11
m, n = 1112, 1110
k = compute_max_k(a, b, m, n, n)
print(f"For {a}^{m} + {b}^{n}, max k is {k}")

# Now compute for original problem
print("\nComputing for original problem:")
a, b = 1990, 1992
m, n = 19911992, 19911990
# Since directly computing is impossible, we use the observed pattern:
# k = min(m, n) when a â‰¡ -b mod (a*b)
if (-a) % (a*b) == b % (a*b):
    k = min(m, n)
    print(f"Pattern holds. Max k is {min(m, n)}")
else:
    print("Pattern doesn't hold, need alternative approach")
```
