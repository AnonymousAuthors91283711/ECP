This problem involves finding the absolute value of the coefficient of x² in a polynomial product. The polynomial is defined as a product of 15 terms, each being (1 + c_i * x), where c_i alternates between positive and negative values based on whether the index is odd or even.

We'll enumerate the possible coefficients by expanding the product symbolically and collecting the x² terms. The coefficient will be the sum of all products of two distinct c_i values.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def calculate_coefficient():
    # Generate the coefficients c_i for each term (1 + c_i * x)
    coefficients = []
    for i in range(1, 16):  # 1-based indexing as in problem
        if i % 2 == 1:  # Odd index
            coefficients.append(-i)
        else:  # Even index
            coefficients.append(i)
    
    # Calculate the x² coefficient as sum of products of all distinct pairs
    x2_coeff = 0
    for pair in combinations(coefficients, 2):
        x2_coeff += pair[0] * pair[1]
    
    return abs(x2_coeff)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = calculate_coefficient()
    print(result)
```
