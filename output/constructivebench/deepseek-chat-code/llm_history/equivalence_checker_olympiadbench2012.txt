Ground Truth Answer: (2500, 7500)
Proposed Answer: (fun n : ℕ => (if Even n then (n/2)^2 else ((n+1)/2)^2, if Even n then n^2/2 else (n^2 + 1)/2)) 100
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal and maximal number of odd values a bijective function f can take on a 100×100 grid, given certain monotonicity conditions.

2. The ground truth answer (2500, 7500) suggests:
   - Minimum: 2500 odd numbers
   - Maximum: 7500 odd numbers

3. The proposed answer is a function that when evaluated at n=100 gives:
   - First component (minimum): if Even 100 then (100/2)^2 = 50^2 = 2500
   - Second component (maximum): if Even 100 then 100^2/2 = 10000/2 = 5000

The first component matches the ground truth (2500), but the second component (5000) doesn't match the ground truth (7500). Therefore, the proposed answer is partially correct but incorrect for the maximum case.
