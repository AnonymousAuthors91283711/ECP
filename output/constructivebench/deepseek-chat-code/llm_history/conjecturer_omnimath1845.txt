<<<429>>>

Explanation: The problem describes a recursive grid where each cell (i,j) is the sum of all cells above and to the left when i,j ≠ 0, with base cases of 1 along the top and left edges. This forms a combinatorial structure similar to Delannoy numbers, where D(m,n) counts paths with steps east, north, and northeast. The answer for grid 7 7 corresponds to D(7,7), which is 429.
