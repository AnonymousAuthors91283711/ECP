The problem involves finding the minimal number of operations needed to transform a given sequence into an arithmetic progression using a specific morph operation. The morph operation conditionally increments the first element and decrements the second when they satisfy `a+1 < b-1`.

Here's a Python program to enumerate possible answers by simulating the morph operations and checking for arithmetic progression:

```python
def is_arithmetic_progression(seq):
    if len(seq) <= 2:
        return True
    d = seq[1] - seq[0]
    return all(seq[i+1] - seq[i] == d for i in range(len(seq)-1))

def morph_operation(seq):
    if len(seq) >= 2:
        a, b = seq[0], seq[1]
        if a + 1 < b - 1:
            return [a+1, b-1] + seq[2:]
    return seq.copy()

def find_min_operations():
    initial_seq = [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,10,10]
    current_seq = initial_seq.copy()
    operations = 0
    
    while True:
        if is_arithmetic_progression(current_seq):
            print(f"Found arithmetic progression at {operations} operations: {current_seq}")
            return operations
        
        current_seq = morph_operation(current_seq)
        operations += 1
        
        # Safety check to prevent infinite loops
        if operations > 1000:
            print("Exceeded maximum operations (1000)")
            return -1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    min_operations = find_min_operations()
    print(f"Minimum operations required: {min_operations}")
```
