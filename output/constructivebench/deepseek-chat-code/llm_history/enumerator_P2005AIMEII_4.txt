This problem asks for the number of positive divisors of at least one of the numbers \(10^{10}\), \(15^7\), or \(18^{11}\). To solve this, we'll use the inclusion-exclusion principle to count the divisors while avoiding double-counting.

The approach is:
1. Factorize each number into primes
2. Compute the number of divisors for each number individually
3. Compute pairwise GCDs and their divisor counts
4. Compute the three-way GCD and its divisor count
5. Apply inclusion-exclusion: |A∪B∪C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |B∩C| + |A∩B∩C|

```python
def num_divisors(factors):
    """Compute number of divisors from prime factorization (as dict)"""
    count = 1
    for exp in factors.values():
        count *= (exp + 1)
    return count

def gcd_factors(f1, f2):
    """Compute GCD of two numbers represented by their factorizations"""
    common = {}
    for p in set(f1) & set(f2):
        common[p] = min(f1[p], f2[p])
    return common

# Factorizations
factors_10_10 = {2:10, 5:10}
factors_15_7 = {3:7, 5:7}
factors_18_11 = {2:11, 3:11}

# Individual counts
a = num_divisors(factors_10_10)
b = num_divisors(factors_15_7)
c = num_divisors(factors_18_11)

# Pairwise intersections
ab = num_divisors(gcd_factors(factors_10_10, factors_15_7))
ac = num_divisors(gcd_factors(factors_10_10, factors_18_11))
bc = num_divisors(gcd_factors(factors_15_7, factors_18_11))

# Three-way intersection
abc = num_divisors(gcd_factors(gcd_factors(factors_10_10, factors_15_7), factors_18_11))

# Inclusion-exclusion result
result = a + b + c - ab - ac - bc + abc
print(result)
```
