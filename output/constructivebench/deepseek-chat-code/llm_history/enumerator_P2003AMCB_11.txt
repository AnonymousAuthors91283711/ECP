This problem involves finding the actual time when a faulty watch shows 22:00, where the watch runs at a rate of 57.6 minutes per real hour. The watch's time is given by the linear function `watchTime(t) = (t-12)*(57.6/60) + 12`, and we need to find the minimal actual time `t` where `watchTime(t) = 22`.

We'll solve for `t` in the equation and verify it's the minimal solution. The program will compute the exact solution.

```python
def watch_time(actual_time):
    return (actual_time - 12) * (57.6 / 60) + 12

# Solve watch_time(t) = 22 for t
# (t - 12)*(57.6/60) + 12 = 22
# (t - 12)*(0.96) = 10
# t - 12 = 10 / 0.96
# t = 12 + 10 / 0.96

solution = 12 + 10 / 0.96
print(f"Exact solution: {solution}")
print(f"Decimal approximation: {solution:.10f}")
```
