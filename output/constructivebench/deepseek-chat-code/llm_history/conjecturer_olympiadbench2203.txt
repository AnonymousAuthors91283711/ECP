The error occurs because Lean doesn't allow pattern matching with repeated variables in set comprehensions. We need to rewrite the answer using proper Lean syntax for set unions and set builders. Here's the corrected version:

<<<
{(1 / sqrt 3, 1 / sqrt 3, 1 / sqrt 3), (-1 / sqrt 3, -1 / sqrt 3, -1 / sqrt 3)} ∪
{(1, 1, 0), (-1, -1, 0)} ∪
{(1, 0, 1), (-1, 0, -1)} ∪
{(0, 1, 1), (0, -1, -1)}
>>>

Explanation:
1. The symmetric case (a=b=c) gives two solutions with a = ±1/√3
2. The cases where two variables are equal and one is zero give solutions (1,1,0), (-1,-1,0), and permutations
3. The answer is written explicitly as a union of finite sets to avoid the pattern matching issue
4. All enumerated solutions are included in this set
5. The structure maintains the same logical content as the original proposed answer but in valid Lean syntax[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error occurs because Lean is interpreting the numbers as natural numbers (ℕ) rather than real numbers (ℝ). We need to explicitly cast the numbers to ℝ and properly format the set operations. Here's the corrected version:

<<<{(1 / Real.sqrt 3, 1 / Real.sqrt 3, 1 / Real.sqrt 3), (-1 / Real.sqrt 3, -1 / Real.sqrt 3, -1 / Real.sqrt 3)} ∪
{(1, 1, 0), (-1, -1, 0)} ∪
{(1, 0, 1), (-1, 0, -1)} ∪
{(0, 1, 1), (0, -1, -1)}>>>

Explanation:
1. Changed `sqrt` to `Real.sqrt` to ensure we're using real number operations
2. Kept the structure of the solution set which includes:
   - Two symmetric solutions where a = b = c (both positive and negative cases)
   - Three pairs of solutions where two variables are equal and the third is 0 (all permutations)
3. The enumerated answers confirm these cases, showing the symmetric solution (≈0.577) and the cases where two variables are equal and the third is 0.

The solution captures all cases where:
- All three variables are equal (symmetric case)
- Two variables are equal and the third is zero (degenerate cases)
- All permutations of these cases due to symmetry in the original equations
