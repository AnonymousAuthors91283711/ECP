Ground Truth Answer: fun k => (k ^ 2 - 4) ^ 2 / (4 * k * (k ^ 2 + 4))
Proposed Answer: fun k => (k^2 - 4) / k
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives a relationship between (x,y) and k, and asks for an expression involving x^8 and y^8 in terms of k.

2. The ground truth answer is a complex rational function of k: (k^2 - 4)^2 / (4*k*(k^2 + 4))

3. The proposed answer is much simpler: (k^2 - 4)/k

4. To check equivalence, let's test with specific values:
   - Let x=√3, y=1:
     k = (3+1)/(3-1) + (3-1)/(3+1) = 2 + 0.5 = 2.5
     Ground truth: (2.5^2-4)^2/(4*2.5*(2.5^2+4)) ≈ 0.036
     Proposed: (2.5^2-4)/2.5 ≈ 0.9
     These are not equal

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the ground truth. The expressions are fundamentally different.
