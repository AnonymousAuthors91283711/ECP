[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that for any multiset S of size n, there exists an element a in S that appears at least twice, and when we replace two copies of a with a+p and a+q, the resulting multiset T must contain an element that appears at least twice.

We'll write a Python program to find this minimal n for small values of p and q. The key observation is that n must be large enough to guarantee the pigeonhole principle forces a duplicate in either the original multiset or the transformed one.

```python
def find_min_n(p, q):
    # We'll test n values starting from 2 upwards
    for n in range(2, 20):
        found_counterexample = False
        # We'll test all possible multisets with elements up to n
        # This is a simplification - in reality we'd need to check all possible distributions
        for a in range(1, n+1):
            # The worst case is when we have as many distinct elements as possible
            # So we consider the multiset with floor(n/2) distinct elements appearing twice
            # (or one extra single element if n is odd)
            # After replacement, we need to ensure there's still a duplicate
            max_distinct = (n // 2) + (n % 2)
            # After replacing two a's with a+p and a+q, the number of distinct elements
            # could increase by at most 2 (if a+p and a+q are new)
            new_distinct = max_distinct - 1 + 2  # -1 for removing two a's, +2 for new elements
            new_size = n  # total size remains the same
            # The worst case for duplicates is when new_distinct is maximized
            # We need at least one duplicate, so new_size must be >= new_distinct + 1
            if new_distinct > new_size - 1:
                found_counterexample = True
                break
        if not found_counterexample:
            print(f"For p={p}, q={q}, candidate n={n}")
            return n
    return None

# Test with small sample values
sample_params = [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (1, 3)]
for p, q in sample_params:
    print(f"Testing p={p}, q={q}")
    find_min_n(p, q)
```
