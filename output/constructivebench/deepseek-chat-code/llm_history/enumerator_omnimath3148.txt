[write_program]
This problem appears to be about finding a sequence of real numbers (indexed by natural numbers) that tends to 0. Since we need to enumerate possible candidates, I'll create a Python program that generates various common sequences known to converge to 0, along with their values at small indices.

The program will:
1. Define several common sequences that converge to 0
2. Calculate their values for small indices (n=1 to 10)
3. Print the sequences with their values
4. Let the user observe which sequences satisfy the convergence property

```python
import math

def main():
    # Define several sequence functions that converge to 0
    sequences = {
        '1/n': lambda n: 1/n,
        '1/n^2': lambda n: 1/(n**2),
        '1/sqrt(n)': lambda n: 1/math.sqrt(n),
        '1/log(n+1)': lambda n: 1/math.log(n+1),
        '1/2^n': lambda n: 1/(2**n),
        'n/2^n': lambda n: n/(2**n),
        'sin(n)/n': lambda n: math.sin(n)/n,
        'log(n)/n': lambda n: math.log(n)/n,
    }
    
    # Calculate and print values for n=1 to 10
    print("Sequences converging to 0:")
    print("n\t" + "\t".join(sequences.keys()))
    for n in range(1, 11):
        values = [f"{seq(n):.4f}" for seq in sequences.values()]
        print(f"{n}\t" + "\t".join(values))
    
    print("\nAll these sequences tend to 0 as n → ∞")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
