This problem involves finding all real numbers t for which there exists an infinite set X of real numbers satisfying a certain condition related to distances. The condition states that for any three points x,y,z in X and any center a with spread d, the maximum distance from these points to a-d, a, a+d must be greater than t*d.

To approach this, we'll:
1. Consider small rational values of t to find patterns
2. For each t, try to construct or verify existence of such infinite sets
3. Look for threshold behavior where the condition fails/succeeds

We'll focus on t values between 0 and 2 since the condition becomes trivial for tâ‰¤0 and likely impossible for large t.

```python
def check_condition(t, X, samples=1000):
    """Check if set X satisfies the condition for given t"""
    from itertools import combinations
    from random import uniform
    
    # Test random combinations from X
    for _ in range(samples):
        x, y, z = sorted([uniform(0,1) for _ in range(3)])  # Sample from [0,1]
        a = uniform(0, 1)
        d = uniform(0, min(a, 1-a))
        max_dist = max(abs(x-(a-d)), abs(y-a), abs(z-(a+d)))
        if max_dist <= t * d:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    # Test various t values in (0,2) range
    for t in [i/10 for i in range(1, 20)]:
        # Try X as arithmetic progression
        X_ap = [i/100 for i in range(1000)]
        # Try X as geometric progression
        X_gp = [1.1**i for i in range(100)]
        # Try X as random set
        X_rand = [i**0.5 for i in range(1000)]
        
        for X, name in [(X_ap, "AP"), (X_gp, "GP"), (X_rand, "sqrt")]:
            if check_condition(t, X):
                print(f"t={t:.1f}: {name} satisfies condition")
                break
        else:
            print(f"t={t:.1f}: no set found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
