The problem involves finding relationships between the greatest common divisors (gcd) of natural numbers a, b, c that satisfy the equation 15a + 14b = c. We need to enumerate possible values of a, b, c and check the gcd conditions to understand the patterns.

Here's a Python program that enumerates small values of a and b, computes c, and checks the gcd conditions:

```python
import math

def enumerate_abc(max_a=20, max_b=20):
    for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
        for b in range(1, max_b + 1):
            c = 15 * a + 14 * b
            gcd_a14 = math.gcd(a, 14)
            gcd_b15 = math.gcd(b, 15)
            gcd_c210 = math.gcd(c, 210)
            
            # Print cases where gcd(c,210) = 1
            if gcd_c210 == 1:
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}: gcd(a,14)={gcd_a14}, gcd(b,15)={gcd_b15}, gcd(c,210)=1")
            
            # Also print cases where the implication might fail
            elif (gcd_a14 != 1 and gcd_b15 != 1) and gcd_c210 == 1:
                print(f"Counterexample found: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Enumerating cases where gcd(c,210) = 1:")
    enumerate_abc()
    print("\nNote: If no counterexamples are found, the theorem likely holds for small values.")
```

This program:
1. Iterates through small values of a and b (up to 20 by default)
2. Computes c using the equation 15a + 14b
3. Checks the gcd conditions
4. Prints cases where gcd(c,210) = 1 to observe patterns
5. Also checks for potential counterexamples where both gcd(a,14) and gcd(b,15) are not 1 but gcd(c,210) is 1

The output will help verify the relationships stated in the theorem by showing concrete examples. The program can be adjusted by changing max_a and max_b parameters for more extensive enumeration.
