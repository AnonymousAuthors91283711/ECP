[write_program]
The problem states that for a rational number N, if N/2 = 16, then what is (3*N)/4? The solution involves solving for N and then computing the required expression.

We'll write a Python program that:
1. Solves for N (which is 32 since 32/2 = 16)
2. Computes (3*N)/4 (which is 24)
3. Outputs the result as an exact integer value

```python
# Solve N/2 = 16 to get N = 32
N = 32
# Compute (3*N)/4
result = (3 * N) // 4
print(result)
```
