Ground Truth Answer: {(1, [1]), (3, [2, 3, 6]), (4, [4, 4, 4, 4])}
Proposed Answer: {(1, [1])} ∪ {(n, List.replicate (n - 1) 1 ++ [4 * n - 3]) | n > 1}
Let me analyze the problem and compare the answers.

The problem asks for all pairs (n, ks) where:
1. n > 0
2. ks has length n
3. Sum of ks is 5n - 4
4. Sum of reciprocals of ks is 1

Ground truth gives three solutions:
- (1, [1])
- (3, [2, 3, 6])
- (4, [4, 4, 4, 4])

Proposed answer gives:
1. (1, [1])
2. For n>1, (n, [1,1,...,1,4n-3]) (with n-1 ones)

Let's check:
For n=1: Both agree with ([1])
For n=3: Proposed gives [1,1,9], but ground truth has [2,3,6]
For n=4: Proposed gives [1,1,1,13], but ground truth has [4,4,4,4]

The proposed answer misses the other valid solutions and includes incorrect ones (like [1,1,9] for n=3 doesn't satisfy reciprocal sum=1).
