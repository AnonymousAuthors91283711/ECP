[write_program]
This problem involves solving a logarithmic equation and finding a rational solution x = m/n in lowest terms. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible m and n values to find the solution.

The equation simplifies to:
log(3^20)/log(2^x) = log(3^2020)/log(2^(x+3))
Which reduces to:
20/x = 2020/(x+3)

We'll solve this equation and verify the solution is rational and in lowest terms.

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def find_solution():
    # Solve the equation 20/x = 2020/(x+3)
    # Cross multiply: 20(x+3) = 2020x
    # 20x + 60 = 2020x
    # 60 = 2000x
    # x = 60/2000 = 3/100
    x = Fraction(3, 100)
    
    # Verify the solution satisfies the original equation
    # Using exact fractions to avoid floating point errors
    left = 20 / x
    right = 2020 / (x + 3)
    
    if left == right:
        m = x.numerator
        n = x.denominator
        # Check if m and n are coprime (Fraction already reduces)
        if math.gcd(m, n) == 1:
            print(f"Found solution: x = {m}/{n}")
            print(f"m + n = {m + n}")
            return m + n
