Ground Truth Answer: 8117
Proposed Answer: (6102 * 6101 - 2016 * 2015) / (6102 - 2016)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem gives a functional equation f(x) + f(y) = f(x+1) + f(y-1) and two specific values f(2016)=6102 and f(6102)=2016.

2. The functional equation suggests that f is a quadratic function, as it's a second-order recurrence relation.

3. The proposed answer is a complex expression involving the given values, but let's evaluate it numerically:
   (6102*6101 - 2016*2015)/(6102-2016) = (37237302 - 4062240)/4086 = 33175062/4086 ≈ 8119.99

4. The ground truth answer is 8117, which is close but not equal to the proposed answer's evaluation.

5. The difference suggests the proposed answer might have an off-by-one error or incorrect coefficients in the quadratic solution.
