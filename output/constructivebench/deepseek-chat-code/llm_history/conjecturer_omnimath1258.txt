Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated answers, we observe that for each valid sequence of length 1, the value N is always twice the element in the sequence (a i = k implies N = 2k). The number of valid sequences is equal to the number of possible k values where 0 ≤ k ≤ 39 (since 2*39=78 ≤ 202). Therefore, the total count is 40 possible sequences.
