[write_program]
The problem is about finding a relationship between three points L, M, P on a real number line where M divides the segment LP into three equal parts (trisection points). The theorem states that M can be expressed as a function of L and P.

We'll write a Python program to verify the relationship by testing small integer values for L and P, and checking if M satisfies the given conditions. The program will enumerate possible M values between L and P and check the conditions.

```python
def verify_trisection(L, P):
    """Verify the trisection conditions for M between L and P."""
    # The expected M value based on the theorem
    expected_M = L + (1/3) * (P - L)
    expected_N = L + (2/3) * (P - L)
    
    # Check all possible M values with 0.01 precision
    step = 0.01
    M = L
    while M <= P:
        N = L + 2 * (M - L)  # From M - L = N - M
        condition1 = abs(M - (L + (1/3) * (P - L))) < 1e-9
        condition2 = abs(N - (L + (2/3) * (P - L))) < 1e-9
        condition3 = abs((M - L) - (N - M)) < 1e-9
        condition4 = abs((N - M) - (P - N)) < 1e-9
        
        if condition1 and condition2 and condition3 and condition4:
            print(f"For L={L}, P={P}: M={M:.2f} satisfies all conditions")
            return
        M += step

# Test with small integer values
for L in range(0, 5):
    for P in range(L+1, L+6):
        verify_trisection(L, P)
```
