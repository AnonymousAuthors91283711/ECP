Ground Truth Answer: { (m, n) : ℕ × ℕ | m.Coprime n ∧ Odd m ∧ Odd n ∧ ∃ k, m + n = 2^k }
Proposed Answer: {(a, b) | ∃ k, a = 2^k - b ∧ b < 2^k ∧ Coprime a b ∧ Odd a ∧ Odd b}
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. The ground truth defines the set as all pairs (m,n) where:
   - m and n are coprime
   - Both m and n are odd
   - Their sum is a power of 2

2. The proposed answer defines the set as all pairs (a,b) where:
   - There exists k such that a = 2^k - b
   - b < 2^k
   - a and b are coprime
   - Both a and b are odd

Key observations:
- The condition a = 2^k - b is equivalent to a + b = 2^k
- b < 2^k is implied by a = 2^k - b and a ∈ ℕ (since a must be positive)
- The other conditions (coprime, both odd) match exactly

The proposed answer is essentially just rewriting the sum condition as a subtraction and adding the (redundant but harmless) b < 2^k condition. The sets are identical.
