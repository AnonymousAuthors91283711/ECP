open Nat

abbrev mathodyssey34_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem mathodyssey34
: IsGreatest {k : ℕ | 0 < k ∧ 1991^k ∣ 1990^19911992 + 1992^19911990} mathodyssey34_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing with smaller parameters:
For 10^1112 + 11^1110, max k is 0

Computing for original problem:
Pattern doesn't hold, need alternative approach. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
