abbrev omnimath1952_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1952 :
  (∑ n : Set.Icc 1 91, GCDMonoid.gcd (↑n) 91 = omnimath1952_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Possible gcd values and their counts:
gcd(n,91)=1: 72 numbers
gcd(n,91)=7: 12 numbers
gcd(n,91)=13: 6 numbers
gcd(n,91)=91: 1 numbers

Verification: sum of counts = 91 (should equal 91). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated answers, we can see the problem is asking for the sum of gcd(n,91) for n from 1 to 91. The pattern shows:
- gcd=1 occurs 72 times → 72*1 = 72
- gcd=7 occurs 12 times → 12*7 = 84
- gcd=13 occurs 6 times → 6*13 = 78
- gcd=91 occurs 1 time → 1*91 = 91
Total sum = 72 + 84 + 78 + 91 = 325

<<<325>>>
