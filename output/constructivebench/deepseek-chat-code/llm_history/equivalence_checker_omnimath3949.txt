Ground Truth Answer: 2 / Real.sqrt 5
Proposed Answer: 2 * Real.sqrt (2 / 3)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimum value of an expression involving square roots, under certain constraints on variables a and b.

2. The constraints are:
   - a > 0, b > 0
   - 3a² + 2b² = 3a + 2b

3. The expression to minimize is:
   √(a/(b(3a + 2))) + √(b/(a(2b + 3)))

4. The ground truth answer is 2/√5 ≈ 0.8944

5. The proposed answer is 2√(2/3) ≈ 1.6329

The proposed answer (≈1.6329) is significantly larger than the ground truth answer (≈0.8944). They are clearly different values.

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the minimization condition as it's larger than the known minimum value. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
