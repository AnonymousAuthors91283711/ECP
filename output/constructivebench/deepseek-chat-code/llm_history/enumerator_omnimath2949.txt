This problem asks to find integer solutions (x,y) to the system:
1. 2xÂ² + 8y = 26
2. x - y = k (where k is some integer we need to find)

We'll solve it by:
1. Expressing y from the second equation: y = x - k
2. Substituting into the first equation to get a quadratic in x
3. Finding integer solutions for x and corresponding k values
4. Enumerating possible solutions and their k values

```python
def find_solutions():
    # We'll search x in a reasonable range since x^2 grows quickly
    for x in range(-10, 11):
        # From equation 2x^2 + 8y = 26, solve for y
        # Must have (26 - 2x^2) divisible by 8
        numerator = 26 - 2 * x * x
        if numerator % 8 != 0:
            continue
        y = numerator // 8
        k = x - y
        print(f"x={x}, y={y}, k={k}")

    # After enumerating, we can see the possible k values
    # The problem likely asks for all possible k values or extremal ones
    # From the output we can observe the possible k values
