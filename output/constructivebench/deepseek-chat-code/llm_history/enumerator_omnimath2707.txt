[write_program]
This problem appears to be a simple arithmetic calculation. The expression (2*3 + 4)/(2 + 3) evaluates to (6 + 4)/5 = 10/5 = 2. We'll write a Python program that calculates this value exactly and prints it.

```python
# Calculate the exact value of (2*3 + 4)/(2 + 3)
numerator = 2 * 3 + 4
denominator = 2 + 3
result = numerator / denominator
print(result)
```
