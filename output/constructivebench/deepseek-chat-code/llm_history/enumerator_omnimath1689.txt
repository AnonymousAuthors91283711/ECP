[write_program]
This problem asks to find the number of natural numbers n such that there exists a natural number k satisfying:
1. 11k + 2n = 2007
2. n ≤ k

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible n values that satisfy these conditions. The approach is to:
1. Solve the equation for k in terms of n
2. Iterate through possible n values where k is a natural number and n ≤ k
3. Count the valid solutions

```python
def enumerate_solutions():
    count = 0
    max_n = (2007) // 2  # Maximum possible n when k=0 (though k must be ≥1)
    
    for n in range(0, max_n + 1):
        remainder = 2007 - 2 * n
        if remainder <= 0:
            continue
        if remainder % 11 != 0:
            continue
        k = remainder // 11
        if k >= 1 and n <= k:
            print(f"Found solution: n={n}, k={k}")
            count += 1
    
    print(f"Total number of solutions: {count}")

enumerate_solutions()
```
