theorem omnimath3951 (n : ℕ) (hn : 1 < n) (P : ℝ[X]) (hP : 0 < degree P) :
  (∀ x : ℝ, eval x (∏ i ∈ Finset.range n, P.comp (X^(i+1))) = eval x (P.comp (X^(n*(n+1)/2)))) ↔

Ground Truth Answer: fun n k => if Even n then X^k else -X^k
Proposed Answer: fun (n k : ℕ) => monomial k (1 / (k + 1 : ℝ))
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding a polynomial P that satisfies a specific evaluation condition involving composition with powers of X.

2. The ground truth answer gives a simple polynomial that's either X^k or -X^k depending on whether n is even. This clearly satisfies the evaluation condition since composition with X^m just scales the exponents.

3. The proposed answer gives a monomial with a fractional coefficient (1/(k+1)). This is problematic because:
   - The coefficient depends on k in a way that doesn't relate to the problem's condition
   - The evaluation condition doesn't involve any coefficient manipulation
   - The sign doesn't depend on n's parity as in the correct answer

The proposed answer is fundamentally different from the ground truth and doesn't satisfy the problem's requirements.
