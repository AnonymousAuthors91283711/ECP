Ground Truth Answer: fun n k => k
Proposed Answer: fun n k => if 2 * k = n then (k * (k - 1)) / 2 else 0
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimum number of mutual friendships in a friendship graph where each person has exactly k friends out of n total people (with n=2000, k=1000 in the specific case).

2. The ground truth answer is simply `k`, which suggests that the minimum number of mutual friendships is exactly k.

3. The proposed answer is more complex, giving a piecewise function that returns (k*(k-1))/2 when 2*k = n, and 0 otherwise.

Analysis:
- For the specific case where n=2000 and k=1000, 2*k does equal n (2000), so the proposed answer would give (1000*999)/2 = 499500, while the ground truth gives 1000.
- These are clearly different values (499500 ≠ 1000), so the answers are not equivalent.
- The proposed answer seems to be calculating something like the number of possible mutual friendships in a complete subgraph, but this doesn't match the problem's requirements for the minimal case.
