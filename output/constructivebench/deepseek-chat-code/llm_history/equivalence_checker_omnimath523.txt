Ground Truth Answer: (2 * Complex.I - 1) / 4
Proposed Answer: (-1/4) + (1/2) * Complex.I
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves evaluating an infinite series S = ∑ (n+1)/z^(n+1) where z = 1 - 2i
2. The ground truth answer is (2i - 1)/4
3. The proposed answer is (-1/4) + (1/2)i

Let's simplify the ground truth answer:
(2i - 1)/4 = (-1 + 2i)/4 = -1/4 + (2i)/4 = -1/4 + (1/2)i

This is exactly the same as the proposed answer. The two expressions are mathematically equivalent, just written in different forms.
