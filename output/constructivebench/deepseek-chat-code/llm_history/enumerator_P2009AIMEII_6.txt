This problem asks for the number of 5-element subsets of {1,2,...,14} that contain at least one pair of consecutive integers, modulo 1000. We'll enumerate all possible 5-element subsets and count those satisfying the condition.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def solve():
    n = 14
    k = 5
    total = 0
    
    # Generate all k-element subsets of {1,2,...,n}
    for subset in combinations(range(1, n+1), k):
        # Check if any two consecutive numbers exist in the subset
        has_consecutive = any((x + 1) in subset for x in subset)
        if has_consecutive:
            total += 1
    
    # Output the count modulo 1000
    print(f"Total subsets with consecutive pairs: {total}")
    print(f"Answer modulo 1000: {total % 1000}")

solve()
```
