theorem omnimath2057 :
  let bases := ['H', 'M', 'N', 'T']
  let invalidPairs := [('H', 'M'), ('M', 'H'), ('N', 'T'), ('T', 'N')]
  let strandChoices := (product bases bases).filter (fun (b1, b2) => b1 ≠ b2 ∧ ¬(b1, b2) ∈ invalidPairs)
  let pairChoices := (strandChoices ×ˢ strandChoices ×ˢ strandChoices ×ˢ strandChoices ×ˢ strandChoices)
  pairChoices.length = omnimath2057_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Total valid sequences: 32768. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<2^15>>> 

Explanation: The problem counts valid 5-pair sequences where each pair avoids certain invalid combinations. The enumerated answer 32768 is exactly 2^15, suggesting each of the 5 pairs has independent choices with 8 valid options per pair (4 bases × 4 bases minus 8 invalid). However, 8^5=32768, which matches the count, so the answer simplifies to 8^5 or equivalently 2^15.
