[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest number `n` such that any subset of size `n` from the numbers 1 to 280 contains a 5-element subset where all pairs are coprime. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal `n` by checking subsets of increasing sizes until we find the smallest one satisfying the condition.

The approach:
1. Generate all numbers from 1 to 280
2. For increasing subset sizes `n`, check all possible subsets of size `n`
3. For each subset, check if it contains a 5-element coprime subset
4. The first `n` where all size-`n` subsets satisfy this condition is our answer

```python
import itertools
import math

def has_coprime_5_subset(subset):
    # Check all 5-element combinations in the subset
    for combo in itertools.combinations(subset, 5):
        all_coprime = True
        # Check all pairs in the combination
        for a, b in itertools.combinations(combo, 2):
            if math.gcd(a, b) != 1:
                all_coprime = False
                break
        if all_coprime:
            return True
    return False

def find_min_n():
    numbers = list(range(1, 281))
    max_n = 280  # We won't need to check beyond this
    
    for n in range(5, max_n + 1):
        # We'll sample some subsets to get evidence (full enumeration is too slow)
        # For a proper proof, we'd need complete enumeration or smarter math
        sample_count = min(1000, math.comb(280, n))
        found_counterexample = False
        
        # Check several random subsets of size n
        for _ in range(sample_count):
            subset = sorted(random.sample(numbers, n))
            if not has_coprime_5_subset(subset):
                found_counterexample = True
                break
                
        if not found_counterexample:
            print(f"Found candidate n = {n}")
            # For thoroughness, we'd need to verify all subsets
            # But for competition purposes, this gives strong evidence
            return n
    
    return max_n

# Set random seed for reproducibility
import random
random.seed(42)

min_n = find_min_n()
print(f"Minimal n found: {min_n}")
```

Note: The actual mathematical proof would require more sophisticated techniques (likely using the Pigeonhole Principle or Ramsey Theory), but this program provides empirical evidence. The true answer is likely between 200-280, but exact determination would require complete enumeration or advanced combinatorial arguments.
