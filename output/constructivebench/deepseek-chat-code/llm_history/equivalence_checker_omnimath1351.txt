Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives a polynomial P(X) = X^4 - 4X^3 - 4X^2 + 16X - 8 and asks for the sum of absolute values of its real roots.

2. First, let's find the roots of the polynomial. We can factor it as:
   P(X) = (X^2 - 2X - 2)(X^2 - 2X - 4)

3. Solving each quadratic:
   - For X^2 - 2X - 2 = 0: roots are 1 ± √3
   - For X^2 - 2X - 4 = 0: roots are 1 ± √5

4. However, the ground truth answer suggests roots involving √2 and √3, not √5.

5. The proposed answer has √6, which doesn't match either factorization.

6. Calculating the sum of absolute values of the roots from our factorization:
   |1 + √3| + |1 - √3| + |1 + √5| + |1 - √5| = (1 + √3) + (√3 - 1) + (1 + √5) + (√5 - 1) = 2√3 + 2√5

7. Neither the ground truth nor the proposed answer matches this correct sum.
