Here's a Python program that calculates the weighted mean and compares it with the median for the given problem:

```python
def calculate_weighted_mean():
    scores = [70, 80, 85, 90, 95]
    weights = [0.1, 0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.3]
    median = 85
    
    # Calculate weighted mean
    weighted_sum = sum(score * weight for score, weight in zip(scores, weights))
    
    # Calculate difference between mean and median
    difference = weighted_sum - median
    
    # Print intermediate values
    print(f"Weighted sum: {weighted_sum}")
    print(f"Median: {median}")
    print(f"Difference (mean - median): {difference}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    calculate_weighted_mean()
```

The program calculates the weighted mean of the given scores with their corresponding weights, then computes the difference between this mean and the median (which is given as 85). The output shows all intermediate values to help verify the calculation. The final difference is what the problem asks for.
