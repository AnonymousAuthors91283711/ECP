This problem involves finding a unique strictly increasing sequence `a` with specific recurrence relations and boundary conditions. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible sequences that satisfy the given conditions up to `a(13)=2016`, then determine the value of `a(1)`.

The approach:
1. Implement the recurrence relations for odd and even indices
2. Use backtracking to find valid sequences
3. Enumerate possible starting values for `a(1)` and `a(2)`
4. Check if the sequence reaches `a(13)=2016` while being strictly increasing

```python
def find_sequence():
    # Try possible a1 values from 1 upwards
    for a1 in range(1, 100):
        # Try possible a2 values greater than a1
        for a2 in range(a1 + 1, 2 * a1 + 100):
            seq = [0] * 14  # indices 0..13 (0 unused)
            seq[1] = a1
            seq[2] = a2
            valid = True
            
            # Build sequence up to a13
            for k in range(1, 6):
                # Odd index relation: a[2k+1]^2 = a[2k] * a[2k-1]
                n = 2*k + 1
                if n > 13:
                    break
                product = seq[2*k] * seq[2*k-1]
                # Check if product is perfect square
                root = int(product ** 0.5)
                if root * root != product:
                    valid = False
                    break
                seq[n] = root
                
                # Even index relation: a[2k+2] = 2*a[2k+1] - a[2k]
                if n + 1 <= 13:
                    seq[n+1] = 2 * seq[n] - seq[n-1]
            
            # Check if sequence reaches a13=2016 and is strictly increasing
            if valid and seq[13] == 2016:
                strictly_increasing = all(seq[i] < seq[i+1] for i in range(1, 13))
                if strictly_increasing:
                    print(f"Found valid sequence with a1={a1}")
                    print(f"Full sequence: {seq[1:]}")
                    return a1
    
    print("No valid sequence found")
    return None

# Execute the search
a1 = find_sequence()
if a1 is not None:
    print(f"The required value of a(1) is: {a1}")
```

Let me analyze this problem and the provided program:

1. Problem Analysis:
- We need to find a strictly increasing sequence a(n) satisfying specific recurrence relations
- Key conditions:
  - a(13) = 2016
  - For odd indices: a(2k+1)Â² = a(2k)*a(2k-1)
  - For even indices: a(2k+2) = 2*a(2k+1) - a(2k)
- We need to find the unique a(1) that satisfies these conditions

2. Program Issues:
- The search range for a1 (1-100) is too small - the correct a1 is larger
- The a2 range (a1+1 to 2*a1+100) is arbitrary and may miss valid sequences
- The program returns immediately after finding the first valid sequence, but we need to verify uniqueness
- No intermediate results are printed during the search

3. Corrective Actions Needed:
- Expand the search range for a1
- Make the a2 range more flexible
- Print intermediate valid sequences
- Verify uniqueness of the solution
- Optimize the search to avoid unnecessary computations

The original program is rejected because it fails to find the correct solution and doesn't properly verify uniqueness.

<<<False>>>

```python
def find_sequence():
    # Expanded search range for a1 based on problem constraints
    for a1 in range(100, 500):
        # More flexible a2 range while maintaining strict increase
        for a2 in range(a1 + 1, 3 * a1 + 1):
            seq = [0] * 14  # indices 0..13 (0 unused)
            seq[1] = a1
            seq[2] = a2
            valid = True
            
            # Build sequence up to a13
            for k in range(1, 7):
                n = 2*k + 1
                if n > 13:
                    break
                # Odd index relation
                product = seq[2*k] * seq[2*k-1]
                root = int(round(product ** 0.5))
                if root * root != product:
                    valid = False
                    break
                seq[n] = root
                
                # Even index relation
                if n + 1 <= 13:

Judgement Explanation:
The problem is a mathematical sequence problem from the 2016 AIME I competition (Problem 10). It defines a strictly increasing sequence `a` with specific recurrence relations and boundary conditions (a(13)=2016). The task is to find the value of a(1). 

Since no Python program was provided to enumerate possible answers, we must create one from scratch. The problem requires:
1. Defining the recurrence relations for odd and even indices
2. Finding a sequence that satisfies all conditions, particularly a(13)=2016
3. Determining the initial value a(1) that makes this possible

The solution involves working backwards from a(13)=2016 using the recurrence relations to find a(1). We'll implement this in Python with careful handling of the integer sequence constraints.

<<<False>>>

```python
def find_initial_value():
    # We'll work backwards from a13=2016 to find a1
    # The recurrence relations are:
    # For odd n: a(n) = sqrt(a(n-1)*a(n-2))
    # For even n: a(n) = 2*a(n-1) - a(n-2)
    
    # Since the sequence is strictly increasing and consists of integers,
    # we can find possible a12 and a11 values that satisfy a13=2016
    
    # Try possible a12 values (must be <2016)
    for a12 in range(1, 2016):
        # For a13 (odd index), a13^2 = a12*a11 => a11 = 2016^2/a12
        if (2016*2016) % a12 != 0:
            continue
        a11 = (2016*2016) // a12
        
        # Now work backwards through the sequence
        sequence = [0] * 14  # indices 0-13
        sequence[13] = 2016
        sequence[12] = a12
        sequence[11] = a11
        
        valid = True
        for n in range(10, 0, -1):
            if n % 2 == 0:  # even index
                # a(n) = 2*a(n+1) - a(n+2)
                sequence[n] = 2*sequence[n+1] - sequence[n+2]
