This problem asks for the smallest number of students (n) where:
1. Each student scores at least 60
2. There are exactly 5 students who scored 100 (all others must be â‰¤ 99)
3. The average score is exactly 76

We'll model this by:
1. Iterating possible values of n starting from 5 (since we need at least 5 students to have 100s)
2. For each n, calculate the total sum needed (76*n)
3. Subtract the mandatory 500 points (from 5 students with 100)
4. The remaining (76n-500) must be distributed among (n-5) students with scores between 60 and 99

```python
def find_min_n():
    n = 5  # start with minimum possible n (need at least 5 students for the 100s)
    while True:
        total = 76 * n
        remaining = total - 500  # subtract 5*100
        students_left = n - 5
        
        if students_left == 0:
            if remaining == 0:
                print(f"Found candidate: n={n}")
                return n
        else:
            min_possible = 60 * students_left
            max_possible = 99 * students_left
            if min_possible <= remaining <= max_possible:
                print(f"Found candidate: n={n}")
                # Check if remaining can be divided into (n-5) scores between 60-99
                # Since we just need existence, any distribution works if sum matches
                return n
        
        n += 1

print("Searching for minimal n...")
min_n = find_min_n()
print(f"\nThe minimal n is: {min_n}")
```
