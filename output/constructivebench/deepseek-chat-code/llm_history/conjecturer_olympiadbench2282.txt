abbrev olympiadbench2282_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2282 (m : ℝ) :
    (∃ n : ℝ, (3 * n^2 + 1 = m^2 ∧ m^2 + 1 = 2 * (n + 1)^2) ∨
               (3 * n^2 - 1 = m^2 ∧ m^2 - 1 = 2 * (n + 1)^2)) ↔ m ∈ olympiadbench2282_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found m = 1.0 from n = 0 (first system)
Found m = 7.0 from n = 4 (first system)

All distinct valid m values found:
1.0
7.0. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
<<<{1, 7, -1, -7}>>>
