Ground Truth Answer: fun (x, y) => x / y
Proposed Answer: fun (x, y) => if x < y then x / y else y / x
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem asks for the greatest rational number r that can be expressed as x'/y' (or y'/x' in the proposed answer) where x' and y' are two-digit numbers (10-99) with average 60.

2. The ground truth answer simply takes x/y as the ratio, which makes sense since to maximize x/y we want the largest possible x and smallest possible y that satisfy the conditions.

3. The proposed answer adds a conditional: if x < y then x/y else y/x. This is problematic because:
   - The condition x < y is not part of the problem statement
   - For maximizing the ratio, we would never want to take y/x when x > y since that would give a smaller value
   - The greatest ratio occurs when x is maximized (99) and y is minimized (21), giving 99/21

The proposed answer incorrectly modifies the ratio calculation in a way that would prevent finding the actual maximum ratio in some cases. The ground truth answer correctly expresses the ratio to be maximized.
