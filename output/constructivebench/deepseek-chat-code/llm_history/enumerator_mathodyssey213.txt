[write_program]
The problem appears to be about calculating the value of a function `mathodyssey213_answer` at specific inputs, which equals a continuous exponential growth formula. We'll write a Python program to compute this exponential growth value for various parameters to help understand the pattern.

The key formula is: `2658 * exp(0.09 * 15)`. We'll compute this exactly and also show how it changes with different parameters.

```python
import math

def compute_growth(principal, rate, time):
    """Compute continuous exponential growth"""
    return principal * math.exp(rate * time)

# Fixed parameters from the problem
principal = 2658
rate = 0.09
time = 15

# Compute the exact value
result = compute_growth(principal, rate, time)
print(f"For principal={principal}, rate={rate}, time={time}:")
print(f"  Exact value: {result}")

# Show how the result changes with different parameters
print("\nVarying parameters:")
for p in [1000, 2000, 2658, 3000]:
    for r in [0.05, 0.09, 0.12]:
        for t in [5, 10, 15]:
            res = compute_growth(p, r, t)
            print(f"principal={p}, rate={r}, time={t}: {res:.2f}")
```
