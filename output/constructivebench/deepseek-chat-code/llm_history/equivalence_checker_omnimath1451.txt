Ground Truth Answer: (fun n : ℕ => n ^ 2 + n + 1)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 2 * n
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of integer-valued vectors in dimension n where the absolute value of their pairwise dot products is ≤ 1.

2. The ground truth answer suggests the maximum is n² + n + 1. This makes sense because:
   - For n=1, we get 3 vectors: (-1), (0), (1)
   - For n=2, we get 7 vectors (which matches known results for such problems)
   - The formula grows quadratically with n, which is reasonable for this type of problem

3. The proposed answer suggests 2n, which:
   - Is linear rather than quadratic
   - For n=1 gives 2 (missing the zero vector)
   - For n=2 gives 4 (while we know more vectors are possible)
   - Clearly underestimates the maximum possible set size

The answers are not equivalent, and the proposed answer is incorrect.
