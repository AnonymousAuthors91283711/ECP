This problem asks for integer coefficients a, b, c of a quartic polynomial f(x) = x⁴ + a x² + b x + c that has roots at 2, -3, and 5 (and one other root). We need to find all such polynomials and compute a + b + c for each case.

Since f has roots at 2, -3, and 5, it must be divisible by (x-2)(x+3)(x-5). The polynomial can be written as f(x) = (x-2)(x+3)(x-5)(x-k) where k is the fourth root. We'll expand this and find integer k that makes all coefficients integers.

```python
from sympy import symbols, expand, Poly

x = symbols('x')

# Enumerate possible integer fourth roots k
for k in range(-10, 11):  # Reasonable range to search
    f = expand((x - 2)*(x + 3)*(x - 5)*(x - k))
    poly = Poly(f, x)
    coeffs = poly.all_coeffs()
    
    # Extract a, b, c from x^4 + a x^2 + b x + c
    a = coeffs[-3]  # x^2 coefficient
    b = coeffs[-2]  # x coefficient
    c = coeffs[-1]  # constant term
    
    # Verify the polynomial has the required form (no x^3 term)
    if len(coeffs) == 5 and coeffs[1] == 0:
        print(f"k = {k}: a = {a}, b = {b}, c = {c}, a+b+c = {a+b+c}")
```
