The problem asks for the supremum of all real numbers k such that there exist positive real numbers x and y satisfying the equation:
k²(x²/y² + y²/x²) + k(x/y + y/x) = 3

We can simplify this by noticing that (x/y + y/x) and (x²/y² + y²/x²) are related. Let's write a program to explore possible values of k by:
1. Parameterizing the ratio r = x/y
2. Expressing the equation in terms of r
3. Solving for k in terms of r
4. Finding the maximum k value across different r values

```python
import math

def find_max_k():
    max_k = 0
    # Sample r values from 0.1 to 10 with small steps
    for r in [i*0.01 for i in range(1, 1001)] + [i*0.1 for i in range(11, 101)]:
        # Compute terms in the equation
        term1 = r + 1/r  # x/y + y/x
        term2 = r**2 + 1/r**2  # x²/y² + y²/x²
        
        # Solve quadratic equation: k²*term2 + k*term1 - 3 = 0
        a = term2
        b = term1
        c = -3
        
        discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
        if discriminant >= 0:
            k1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
            k2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
            
            # We're interested in positive k values
            for k in [k1, k2]:
                if k > 0:
                    print(f"r={r:.3f}, k={k:.6f}")
                    if k > max_k:
                        max_k = k
    
    print(f"\nMaximum k found: {max_k:.6f}")

find_max_k()
```
