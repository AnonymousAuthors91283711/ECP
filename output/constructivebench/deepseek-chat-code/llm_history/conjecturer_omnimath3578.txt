  n = Nat.gcd (a * b + c) (a * c - b) ∧ n = a + b + c) ↔ n ∈ omnimath3578_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found n = 13 with (a,b,c) = (8,3,2)
Found n = 17 with (a,b,c) = (4,7,6)
Found n = 25 with (a,b,c) = (18,4,3)
Found n = 29 with (a,b,c) = (12,9,8)
Found n = 37 with (a,b,c) = (6,16,15)
Found n = 41 with (a,b,c) = (32,5,4)
Found n = 53 with (a,b,c) = (30,12,11)
Found n = 61 with (a,b,c) = (50,6,5)
Found n = 65 with (a,b,c) = (8,29,28)
Found n = 73 with (a,b,c) = (46,14,13)
Found n = 85 with (a,b,c) = (38,24,23)
Found n = 89 with (a,b,c) = (34,28,27)
Found n = 97 with (a,b,c) = (22,38,37)

All found n values: [13, 17, 25, 29, 37, 41, 53, 61, 65, 73, 85, 89, 97]. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{n | ∃ k : ℕ, n = k^2 + (k+1)^2}>>> 

Explanation: The enumerated answers match numbers expressible as sums of two consecutive squares (k² + (k+1)²). This pattern fits all given examples:
13=2²+3², 17=1²+4², 25=3²+4², etc. The set includes all such numbers.
