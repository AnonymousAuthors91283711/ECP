[write_program]
This problem appears to be about finding the sum of three specific integers represented in a digit-like format. The integers are constructed as:
1. 100*6 + 10*6 + 3 = 663
2. 100*6 + 10*2 + 9 = 629
3. 100*(-6) + 10*(-18) + 21 = -600 -180 +21 = -759

The program will calculate these values and their sum directly.

```python
# Calculate each term and their sum
term1 = 100 * 6 + 10 * 6 + 3
term2 = 100 * 6 + 10 * 2 + 9
term3 = 100 * (-6) + 10 * (-18) + 21

print(f"Term 1: {term1}")
print(f"Term 2: {term2}")
print(f"Term 3: {term3}")

total = term1 + term2 + term3
print(f"Sum: {total}")
```
