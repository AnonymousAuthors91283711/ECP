This problem asks to find all real numbers x satisfying x³ + 4x = 8, and then verify that some function of x (called omnimath1367_answer) equals 128 for those x values. Since we need to find real roots of the cubic equation and verify a property, we'll:

1. Find the real root(s) of x³ + 4x - 8 = 0
2. For each root, compute the function value (though we don't know the function definition)
3. Check if it equals 128

Since we don't know the omnimath1367_answer function, we'll just find the real root(s) of the equation.

```python
def find_roots():
    # We'll use Newton's method to approximate the real root
    def f(x):
        return x**3 + 4*x - 8
    
    def df(x):
        return 3*x**2 + 4
    
    # Initial guess
    x = 1.0
    tolerance = 1e-10
    max_iterations = 100
    
    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        fx = f(x)
        if abs(fx) < tolerance:
            break
        x = x - fx / df(x)
    
    # Only one real root exists for this cubic
    print(f"Real root found: x ≈ {x}")
    print(f"Verification: x³ + 4x = {x**3 + 4*x} (should be ≈8)")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_roots()
```

The program finds the single real root of the equation x³ + 4x = 8 using Newton's method. The output shows the approximate root and verifies it satisfies the original equation. Without knowing the omnimath1367_answer function, we can't verify the second part of the theorem, but we've found the relevant x value that would be needed for such verification.
