This problem asks to find a unique cubic polynomial f(x) that satisfies specific evaluation conditions at x=1,2,3,5,6,7, and then determine the absolute value of f(0). We'll approach this by constructing the polynomial using the given points and then evaluating it at 0.

The solution involves:
1. Finding a polynomial that matches the given evaluations
2. Using polynomial interpolation with the given points
3. Calculating f(0) and its absolute value

We'll implement this by:
1. Using Newton's divided differences to construct the polynomial
2. Evaluating the polynomial at x=0
3. Printing the absolute value of f(0)

```python
def divided_differences(x, y):
    n = len(y)
    coef = y.copy()
    for j in range(1, n):
        for i in range(n-1, j-1, -1):
            coef[i] = (coef[i] - coef[i-1]) / (x[i] - x[i-j])
    return coef

def newton_poly(x, coef, x_eval):
    n = len(coef) - 1
    p = coef[n]
    for k in range(1, n+1):
        p = coef[n-k] + (x_eval - x[n-k]) * p
    return p

# Given data points
x_points = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]
y_points = [12, -12, -12, 12, 12, -12]

# Compute coefficients using divided differences
coef = divided_differences(x_points, y_points)

# Evaluate at x=0
f0 = newton_poly(x_points, coef, 0)
abs_f0 = abs(f0)

print(f"The absolute value of f(0) is: {abs_f0}")
```
