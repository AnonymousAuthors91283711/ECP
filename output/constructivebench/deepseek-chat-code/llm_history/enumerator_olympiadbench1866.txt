[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest `b` such that there exists a set of numbers (defined by `P(n) = nÂ² + n + 1`) within a consecutive interval `[a, a+b]` that forms a "fragrant" set (where no element is coprime with the product of the others). We'll write a Python program to search for such sets and find the minimal `b`.

The approach:
1. Define the P(n) function
2. Generate candidate sets of P(n) values for different a and b
3. Check if each set is fragrant
4. Find the minimal b where such a set exists

```python
import math
from itertools import combinations

def P(n):
    return n*n + n + 1

def is_fragrant(s):
    for x in s:
        others = [y for y in s if y != x]
        product = 1
        for y in others:
            product *= y
        if math.gcd(x, product) == 1:
            return False
    return True

max_b_to_check = 10  # Reasonable upper bound for demonstration

found = False
min_b = None

for b in range(1, max_b_to_check + 1):
    if found:
        break
    for a in range(1, 100):  # Arbitrary upper bound for a
        # Check all possible subset sizes from 2 up to b+1
        for size in range(2, b+2):
            # Generate all possible combinations of size 'size' in [a,a+b]
            for nums in combinations(range(a, a+b+1), size):
                s = [P(n) for n in nums]
                if is_fragrant(s):
                    print(f"Found fragrant set for a={a}, b={b}: {s}")
                    if min_b is None or b < min_b:
                        min_b = b
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if found:
            break

if min_b is not None:
    print(f"\nMinimal b found: {min_b}")
else:
    print(f"No fragrant sets found for b up to {max_b_to_check}")
```
