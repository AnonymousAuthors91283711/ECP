This problem involves counting the number of triples (A, B, C) of subsets of {1, 2, ..., n} where:
1. A is a subset of B
2. The union A ∪ B ∪ C equals the entire set {1, 2, ..., n}

We'll write a Python program to enumerate these configurations for small values of n to help identify the pattern.

```python
def count_triples(n):
    from itertools import product
    
    elements = set(range(1, n+1))
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through all possible subsets for A, B, C
    for a in product([0, 1], repeat=n):
        A = {i+1 for i, x in enumerate(a) if x}
        for b in product([0, 1], repeat=n):
            B = {i+1 for i, x in enumerate(b) if x}
            if not A.issubset(B):
                continue
            for c in product([0, 1], repeat=n):
                C = {i+1 for i, x in enumerate(c) if x}
                if A.union(B).union(C) == elements:
                    count += 1
    return count

# Compute for small values of n
for n in range(1, 6):
    print(f"n={n}: {count_triples(n)}")
```
