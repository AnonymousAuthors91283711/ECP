[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of functions f from Fin 2002 to ℤ (integers) where:
1. Each f(i) is between 1 and 2002 inclusive
2. The absolute difference between consecutive elements (with wrap-around) is ≤ 2

We'll analyze a smaller version of this problem (n=3) to understand the pattern. The program will count valid sequences for small n values where each element is between 1 and n, and consecutive differences are ≤ 2.

```python
def count_valid_sequences(n):
    from itertools import product
    
    # Generate all possible sequences of length n with values 1..n
    sequences = product(range(1, n+1), repeat=n)
    
    count = 0
    for seq in sequences:
        valid = True
        # Check consecutive differences (including wrap-around)
        for i in range(n):
            j = (i + 1) % n
            if abs(seq[i] - seq[j]) > 2:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1
            print(seq)  # Print valid sequences as they're found
    return count

# Test for small values of n
for n in range(1, 5):
    print(f"\nFor n={n}:")
    total = count_valid_sequences(n)
    print(f"Total valid sequences for n={n}: {total}")
```

The program:
1. Generates all possible sequences of length n with values 1 to n
2. Checks each sequence for the consecutive difference condition
3. Prints valid sequences as they're found
4. Reports the total count for each n

For n=1: Only [1] is valid (1 sequence)
For n=2: All pairs where |a-b|≤2 (all 4 possible pairs are valid)
For n=3: More complex - the program will enumerate them
The output shows the pattern for small n values, which can help deduce the general formula.
