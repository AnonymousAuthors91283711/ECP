[write_program]
This problem involves a recursive sequence `a(n)` with a floor division condition. We need to find all possible values of `a(1)` such that when the recurrence is applied, we get `a(30)=30`. The solution requires enumerating possible starting values and checking which ones satisfy the condition.

We'll write a Python program that:
1. Defines the recurrence relation
2. Tests possible starting values for a(1)
3. Checks which ones lead to a(30)=30
4. Outputs valid candidates as they're found

```python
def compute_a(x):
    a = [0] * 31  # a[0] unused, indices 1..30
    a[1] = x
    for n in range(1, 30):
        term = (a[n] // n) * n + 1
        a[n+1] = term
    return a[30]

# Search for x values that satisfy a(30)=30
valid_x = []
for x in range(1, 10000):  # Reasonable upper bound
    if compute_a(x) == 30:
        valid_x.append(x)
        print(f"Found valid a(1) = {x}")

print("\nAll valid starting values:", valid_x)
```
