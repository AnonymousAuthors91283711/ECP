The problem asks to count the number of triples of permutations (f,g,h) of a 5-element set S that satisfy certain functional equations. The equations state that various compositions of f,g,h must simplify in specific ways. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible triples of permutations of 5 elements and count those satisfying the conditions.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def solve():
    S = [0,1,2,3,4]  # The 5-element set
    count = 0
    
    # Generate all possible triples of permutations
    for f in permutations(S):
        for g in permutations(S):
            for h in permutations(S):
                # Check all conditions
                cond1 = all(f[g[h[x]]] == g[x] and h[g[f[x]]] == g[x] for x in S)
                cond2 = all(g[h[f[x]]] == h[x] and f[h[g[x]]] == h[x] for x in S)
                cond3 = all(h[f[g[x]]] == f[x] and g[f[h[x]]] == f[x] for x in S)
                
                if cond1 and cond2 and cond3:
                    count += 1
                    print(f"Found solution #{count}")
    
    print(f"Total solutions: {count}")

solve()
```

Note: This program will be computationally expensive since there are (5!)^3 = 1,728,000 possible triples to check. For demonstration purposes, you might want to reduce the set size (e.g., to 3 elements) first to verify the approach works before running on the full 5-element case. The actual answer for 5 elements would require significant computation time.
