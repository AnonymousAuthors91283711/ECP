    {(x, y) : ℤ × ℤ | x ^ 2 + x * y + y ^ 2 = ((x + y : ℚ) / 3 + 1) ^ 3} = omnimath4397_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found pair: (-17, 53)
Found pair: (-1, 1)
Found pair: (-1, 19)
Found pair: (1, -1)
Found pair: (3, 3)
Found pair: (19, -1)
Found pair: (53, -17)

All found pairs:
(-17, 53)
(-1, 1)
(-1, 19)
(1, -1)
(3, 3)
(19, -1)
(53, -17). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ)
Looking at the enumerated answers, we notice they satisfy x + y = 3k where k is an integer. Letting k = x + y, the equation simplifies. The solutions appear to be all pairs (a, b) where a + b = 0 or 6, plus the specific pairs (-17,53) and (53,-17) which satisfy a + b = 36.

<<<{(x, y) | x + y = 0 ∨ x + y = 6 ∨ (x, y) = (-17, 53) ∨ (x, y) = (53, -17)}>>>
