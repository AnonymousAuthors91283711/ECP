This problem involves counting the number of valid function assignments from 5 elements to 4 stores, with constraints that parents (elements 0,1) cannot be assigned to the same store as any children (elements 2,3,4). We'll enumerate all possible functions and count those satisfying the constraints.

```python
from itertools import product

def solve():
    parents = {0, 1}
    children = {2, 3, 4}
    stores = range(4)
    count = 0
    
    # Enumerate all possible functions (4^5 possibilities)
    for f in product(stores, repeat=5):
        valid = True
        # Check all parent-child pairs
        for p in parents:
            for c in children:
                if f[p] == f[c]:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1
            print(f"Found valid assignment {f}")  # Stream partial results
    
    print(f"Total valid assignments: {count}")

solve()
```
