This problem involves finding the minimal k = m + n where m > 1, n are positive integers such that the domain of f(x) = arcsin(logₘ(nx)) is an interval [a,b] with length 1/2013. The solution requires finding m and n that satisfy these conditions.

We'll:
1. Iterate through possible m values (bases of logarithm)
2. For each m, find n such that the domain length condition holds
3. Track the minimal m + n found

```python
import math

def find_min_k():
    min_k = float('inf')
    best_mn = (0, 0)
    
    # m must be >1, start with small values
    for m in range(2, 100):
        # The domain condition requires logₘ(nx) ∈ [-1,1]
        # So x must be in [1/(n*m), m/n]
        # Interval length is m/n - 1/(n*m) = (m² - 1)/(n*m) = 1/2013
        # Solve for n: n = 2013*(m² - 1)/m
        
        # Calculate n and check if integer
        numerator = 2013 * (m**2 - 1)
        if numerator % m != 0:
            continue
        n = numerator // m
        
        k = m + n
        if k < min_k:
            min_k = k
            best_mn = (m, n)
            print(f"Found candidate: m={m}, n={n}, k={k}")
    
    print(f"Minimal k found: {min_k} (m={best_mn[0]}, n={best_mn[1]})")
    print(f"k mod 1000 = {min_k % 1000}")

find_min_k()
```
