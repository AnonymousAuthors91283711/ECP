[write_program]
This problem asks whether there exists an injective function f from natural numbers to natural numbers with range {2,3,...,2000} that preserves gcd relationships (gcd(f(a),f(b)) = gcd(a,b) for all aâ‰ b). The Lean theorem states this is equivalent to some boolean answer (which we shouldn't reveal).

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Check small cases (n=2,3,4,...) to see if such functions exist
2. Look for patterns or invariants that might prevent such functions
3. Output findings for each small case

```python
def check_gcd_preserving(f):
    """Check if function f preserves gcd relationships"""
    n = len(f)
    for a in range(n):
        for b in range(a+1, n):
            if math.gcd(a+1, b+1) != math.gcd(f[a], f[b]):
                return False
    return True

def find_functions(max_n):
    """Search for gcd-preserving functions for small n"""
    import math
    from itertools import permutations
    
    for n in range(2, 7):  # Check small cases due to factorial complexity
        target = list(range(2, 2+n))
        print(f"\nChecking n={n}, target range {target}")
        
        # Try all permutations of the target range
        found = False
        for perm in permutations(target):
            if check_gcd_preserving(perm):
                print(f"Found valid function: {perm}")
                found = True
                break
        
        if not found:
            print(f"No valid function found for n={n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_functions(6)
```
