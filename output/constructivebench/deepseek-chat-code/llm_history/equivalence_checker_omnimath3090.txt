Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us the equation 2*n + 5 = 16 and asks us to find the value of 2*n - 3.

2. First, solve for n:
   2*n + 5 = 16
   => 2*n = 11
   => n = 5.5

3. However, n is defined as a natural number (ℕ), and 5.5 is not a natural number. This suggests there's no solution in natural numbers.

4. The ground truth answer is 8, which would imply n=5.5 (since 2*5.5-3=8), but this contradicts n being natural.

5. The proposed answer is 0, which is also incorrect for the same reason - there's no natural number n that satisfies the original equation.

6. Both answers are incorrect because the problem has no solution in natural numbers. However, they are not equivalent to each other.
