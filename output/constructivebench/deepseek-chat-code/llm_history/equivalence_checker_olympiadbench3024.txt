Ground Truth Answer: fun T => 125
Proposed Answer: fun T : ℕ => 2 * T + 15
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem gives us T = 55 and asks us to find K that satisfies several conditions.

2. Ground truth answer is K = 125 when T = 55.

3. Proposed answer is K = 2*T + 15, which would be K = 2*55 + 15 = 125 when T = 55.

4. Let's verify if K = 125 satisfies all conditions:
   - 20 < 55-5 < K → 20 < 50 < 125 (true)
   - r = 50/20 = 2.5 > 1, 50*2.5 = 125 (true)
   - 19 < 125 < 4*55+11 → 19 < 125 < 231 (true)
   - d = 125-19 = 106 > 0, 125+106 = 231 = 4*55+11 (true)

5. The proposed function 2*T+15 gives the correct answer when T=55, but we should check if it works for other T values (though the problem only specifies T=55).

6. The ground truth answer is specifically for T=55, while the proposed answer is a general formula that happens to match at T=55.

<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is correct for the given T=55 case, but it's a more general solution than the ground truth which is specific to T=55. The equivalence depends on whether we're considering the general case or just T=55.
