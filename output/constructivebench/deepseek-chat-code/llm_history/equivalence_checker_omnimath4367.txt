Ground Truth Answer: fun N => ∃ a b : ℕ, N = 2^a * 3^b
Proposed Answer: fun N : ℕ => ∃ m : ℕ, N = 2^m ∨ N = 3 * 2^m ∨ N = 4 * 2^m ∨ N = 9 * 2^m
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth states that N must be of the form 2^a * 3^b, where a and b are natural numbers (including zero). This means N can be:
- Any power of 2 (when b=0)
- Any power of 3 (when a=0)
- Any product of powers of 2 and 3

The proposed answer suggests N must be either:
1. A power of 2 (N = 2^m)
2. 3 times a power of 2 (N = 3*2^m)
3. 4 times a power of 2 (N = 4*2^m)
4. 9 times a power of 2 (N = 9*2^m)

The proposed answer is more restrictive than the ground truth. For example:
- N=27 (3^3) is allowed by ground truth but not by proposed answer
- N=6 (2*3) is allowed by ground truth but not by proposed answer
- N=12 (2^2*3) is allowed by ground truth but not by proposed answer
- N=18 (2*3^2) is allowed by ground truth but not by proposed answer

The proposed answer only captures a subset of cases where b ≤ 2 and where the 3's factor is either 0, 1, or 2, and must appear with a single power of 2.
