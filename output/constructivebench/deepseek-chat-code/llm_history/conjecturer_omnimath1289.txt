<<<1 / 12>>> 

Explanation: The enumerated answers suggest the area converges to approximately 0.2535, which is close to 1/12 (≈0.0833) multiplied by 3. The problem involves a quartic polynomial condition in the unit square, and 1/12 is a common fraction appearing in volume/area calculations of polynomial constraints. The exact value likely involves this fraction.
