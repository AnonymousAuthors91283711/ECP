This problem asks for the smallest positive real number t where sin(πt - π/2) = -1. We'll enumerate candidate solutions by:

1. Solving the trigonometric equation sin(πt - π/2) = -1
2. Finding the smallest positive solution
3. Verifying it's indeed the least solution

The equation sin(x) = -1 has solutions at x = 3π/2 + 2πk for any integer k. We'll translate this to our equation and find the minimal positive t.

```python
import math

def find_min_positive_t():
    # Solutions to sin(x) = -1 are x = 3π/2 + 2πk for integer k
    # So πt - π/2 = 3π/2 + 2πk
    # => t - 1/2 = 3/2 + 2k
    # => t = 2 + 2k
    
    # Find the smallest positive t
    k = -1  # Start with k=-1 to get smallest possible positive t
    while True:
        t = 2 + 2*k
        if t > 0:
            print(f"Found solution: t = {t}")
            print(f"Verification: sin(π*{t} - π/2) = {math.sin(math.pi*t - math.pi/2)} (should be -1)")
            print(f"Smallest positive solution: {t}")
            return
        k += 1

find_min_positive_t()
