[write_program]
This problem is about verifying a simple chain of linear relationships between variables x, y, z. The Python program will compute z based on the given relationships and print the result. Since the relationships are straightforward, we'll compute them directly.

```python
# Compute z based on given relationships x=3, y=2x, z=3y
x = 3
y = 2 * x
z = 3 * y
print(z)
```
