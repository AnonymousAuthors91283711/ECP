This problem asks for the smallest natural number K such that 4*3*2*K ≥ 70. We can solve this by computing the minimal K that satisfies the inequality.

The approach is:
1. Compute the product 4*3*2 = 24
2. Solve for K in 24*K ≥ 70 → K ≥ 70/24 ≈ 2.916...
3. Since K must be an integer, the smallest satisfying K is 3

Here's a Python program that verifies this by checking K values sequentially until the inequality is satisfied:

```python
def find_min_k():
    product = 4 * 3 * 2
    threshold = 70
    k = 1
    while True:
        if product * k >= threshold:
            print(f"Found satisfying K: {k}")
            print(f"Minimal K is: {k}")
            break
        k += 1

find_min_k()
```
