The average of set S is: 651. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we need to find the average of set S (∑ x ∈ S, x / card S) that satisfies both given conditions. The conditions involve inserting 1 and 2001 into S and comparing the new averages.

Looking at the pattern:
1. The proposed answer (13*2001 + 27*1)/(13+27) gives 651, which matches the expected answer
2. The enumerated answers show verification points at 638 and 678, but the final expected average is 651
3. The structure suggests a weighted average between 1 and 2001, with weights 27 and 13 respectively

The error in the original proposal was due to missing the `noncomputable` declaration for real number division. Here's the corrected version:

<<<noncomputable def P2001AIMEI_2_answer : ℝ := (13 * 2001 + 27 * 1) / (13 + 27)>>>

Explanation:
- The solution is a weighted average of 1 and 2001
- The weights come from the coefficients in the problem (13 and 27)
- This matches both the enumerated answers and the mathematical structure of the problem
- The noncomputable declaration is needed because we're working with real numbers in Lean[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we need to find the average of set S that satisfies both given conditions. The conditions involve inserting 1 and 2001 into S and comparing the new averages.

Looking at the pattern:
1. The proposed answer (13*2001 + 27*1)/(13+27) gives 651, which matches the enumerated answer
2. The conditions suggest a weighted average between the two insertion points (1 and 2001)
3. The coefficients 13 and 27 appear to be weights from the conditions

The error in the original proposal was due to redundant declarations. Here's the corrected version:

<<<(13 * 2001 + 27 * 1) / (13 + 27)>>>

Explanation:
1. The conditions show that inserting 1 decreases the average by 13, while inserting 2001 increases it by 27
2. This suggests the true average is a weighted mean between 1 and 2001
3. The weights come from the coefficients (13 and 27) in the conditions
4. The formula (13*2001 + 27*1)/(13+27) gives the weighted average

The average of set S is: 651. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we need to find the average of set S (∑ x ∈ S, x / card S) that satisfies both given conditions. The conditions involve inserting 1 and 2001 into the set and comparing the new averages.

Looking at the pattern:
1. When we insert 1, the average decreases by 13
2. When we insert 2001, the average increases by 27
3. The enumerated answers suggest the final average is 651

The proposed answer (2001*13 + 1*27)/(13+27) = 651.0 matches the enumerated verification. The error was due to using 'abbrev' instead of 'noncomputable def' for a real number definition.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable def P2001AIMEI_2_answer : ℝ := (2001 * 13 + 1 * 27) / (13 + 27)>>>

Explanation:
This is a weighted average of the two extreme values (1 and 2001), where the weights are the amounts they affect the average (27 and 13 respectively). The formula (2001*13 + 1*27)/(13+27) gives exactly 651, which matches both the enumerated answers and the problem conditions.
