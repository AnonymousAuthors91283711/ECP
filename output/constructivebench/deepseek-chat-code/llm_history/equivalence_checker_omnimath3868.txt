Ground Truth Answer: { fun x => x, fun x => 1 / x }
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℝ, f = fun x => x^c}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer {f | ∃ c : ℝ, f = fun x => x^c} is close to the ground truth {fun x => x, fun x => 1/x}, but not exactly equivalent. The ground truth contains only two specific functions (linear and reciprocal), while the proposed answer includes all power functions with arbitrary real exponents c. The condition in the problem is indeed satisfied by all power functions f(x) = x^c (as can be verified by substitution), but the problem statement might imply that these are the only solutions (making the ground truth answer incomplete). However, without seeing the full proof, we can't be certain if other solutions exist. The proposed answer is more general and correct in terms of including valid solutions, but we don't know if it's exhaustive.
