This problem involves finding the number of cubic polynomials q(x) such that P(q(x)) = P(x)*R(x) for some cubic polynomial R(x), where P(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3). We'll enumerate possible q polynomials by considering their behavior at the roots of P (x=1,2,3).

The key observation is that q must map the roots {1,2,3} to themselves in some permutation. We'll generate all possible permutations of q's values at these points and count valid cubic polynomials.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def count_valid_cubics():
    roots = [1, 2, 3]
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through all possible permutations of q's values at roots
    for perm in permutations(roots):
        a, b, c = perm
        
        # We'll construct q(x) = A(x-2)(x-3) + B(x-1)(x-3) + C(x-1)(x-2) + (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)*D
        # But since q must be cubic, D can be any constant, but we need to ensure the leading coefficient is non-zero
        
        # Using Lagrange interpolation for the first three terms (quadratic part)
        # Then adding a cubic term with arbitrary coefficient
        
        # For each permutation, there's exactly one cubic polynomial (up to scaling)
        # But since we need exact degree 3, we can fix the leading coefficient
        
        # All such polynomials will satisfy the condition with appropriate R(x)
        count += 1
    
    # Additionally consider cases where q maps multiple roots to the same value
    # These would be constant polynomials, but they don't have degree 3
    # So we don't count them
    
    # Also consider cases where q is a permutation plus a multiple of P(x)
    # Each permutation gives a family q(x) = q0(x) + k*P(x) where q0 is the base solution
    # But since P is cubic, this preserves the degree only when q0 is cubic
    
    # The count is equal to the number of permutations of 3 elements
    print(f"Found {count} candidate polynomials")
    print(f"Total valid cubic polynomials: {count}")
