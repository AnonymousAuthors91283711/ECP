This problem asks for the cardinality of the set of real numbers x such that there exists an integer n where n equals the square root of (120 minus the square root of x). We need to find all possible integer values n can take that make the expression valid, then count the corresponding x values.

The approach is:
1. Find all integer n where 120 - √x = n² has real solutions
2. For each valid n, determine the range of x values
3. Count the number of valid x values

```python
import math

def enumerate_solutions():
    valid_x_count = 0
    
    # Iterate possible integer n values
    max_n = int(math.sqrt(120))  # Since 120 - sqrt(x) >= 0
    for n in range(-max_n, max_n + 1):
        # We need 120 - n² >= 0 and must be perfect square since sqrt(x) must be real
        if 120 - n*n < 0:
            continue
        
        # The expression inside must be non-negative and perfect square
        # sqrt(x) = 120 - n² => x = (120 - n²)²
        # But x must be >=0, which is always true here
        x = (120 - n*n)**2
        valid_x_count += 1
        print(f"n={n}, x={x}")
    
    print(f"Total distinct x values: {valid_x_count}")

enumerate_solutions()
```
