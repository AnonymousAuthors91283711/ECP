Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ → Set ℕ
From the enumerated answers, we can observe that for all pairs (x, y), the function f(x, y) always returns 0. This suggests that the only possible value in the solution set is 0, regardless of the input coordinates. Therefore, the answer set should always be {0}.
