theorem omnimath3968 :
  {(x, p) : ℕ × ℕ | x > 0 ∧ p > 0 ∧ p.Prime ∧ x ≤ 2 * p ∧ (x ^ (p - 1) ∣ (p - 1) ^ x + 1)} = omnimath3968_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 2), (3, 3)} ∪ {(1, p) | p : ℕ, p.Prime}
Proposed Answer: {(1, p) | p ∈ {n | n.Prime}} ∪ {(2, 2), (3, 3)}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both answers describe the same set:
1. All pairs (1, p) where p is a prime number
2. The specific pairs (2, 2) and (3, 3)

The notation difference ({n | n.Prime} vs {p : ℕ, p.Prime}) is just syntactic variation and doesn't affect the meaning. The order of the union operation also doesn't matter as set union is commutative.
