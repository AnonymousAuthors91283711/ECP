[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest base `b > 1` where the factorial of 11 (11!) can be written as `k*b²` with `b` not dividing `k`, and no smaller exponent than 2 satisfies this condition. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible bases `b` and check these conditions.

The approach:
1. Compute 11! (39916800)
2. For each candidate base `b` from 2 upwards:
   - Check if b² divides 11!
   - Find the maximal exponent e where b^e divides 11!
   - Verify e = 2 (the minimal exponent satisfying the condition)
   - Check that b doesn't divide the cofactor k = 11!/b²

```python
import math

def main():
    T = 11
    fact = math.factorial(T)
    print(f"Computing for 11! = {fact}")
    
    for b in range(2, 1000):  # Reasonable upper bound
        b_squared = b * b
        if fact % b_squared != 0:
            continue
        
        # Find maximal exponent e where b^e divides fact
        e = 0
        temp = fact
        while temp % b == 0:
            e += 1
            temp = temp // b
        
        if e != 2:
            continue
        
        k = fact // b_squared
        if k % b == 0:
            continue
        
        # Check no smaller exponent works
        valid = True
        for m in range(1, 2):  # Only need to check m=1
            b_power = b ** (m + 1)
            if fact % b_power != 0:
                continue
            k_m = fact // b_power
            if k_m % b != 0:
                valid = False
                break
        
        if valid:
            print(f"Found candidate: b = {b}")
            # Since we're checking in order, first found is minimal
            print(f"Minimal b found: {b}")
            return

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
