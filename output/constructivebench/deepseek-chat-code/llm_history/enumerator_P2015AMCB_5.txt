The problem asks for the smallest positive integer N such that 19*(3 + N) ≤ 20*(1 + N). We need to find the minimal N satisfying this inequality. The solution involves solving the inequality and finding the smallest integer N that satisfies it.

Here's a Python program that enumerates possible values of N starting from 1 upwards, checks the inequality, and stops when it finds the smallest N that satisfies the condition:

```python
def find_min_N():
    N = 1
    while True:
        left = 19 * (3 + N)
        right = 20 * (1 + N)
        print(f"Testing N={N}: 19*(3+{N})={left} ≤ 20*(1+{N})={right} -> {left <= right}")
        if left <= right:
            print(f"Found minimal N: {N}")
            return
        N += 1

find_min_N()
```

The program:
1. Starts with N=1 and increments N until the inequality is satisfied
2. For each N, calculates both sides of the inequality and prints the comparison
3. When the inequality is first satisfied, it prints the minimal N and stops
4. The output shows the testing process and the final answer

The mathematical solution would be:
19*(3+N) ≤ 20*(1+N)
57 + 19N ≤ 20 + 20N
57 - 20 ≤ 20N - 19N
37 ≤ N
So the minimal N is 37. The Python program verifies this by enumeration.
