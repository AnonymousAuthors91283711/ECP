Solution:
x = -2.0
y = -1.118033988749895
z = -4.47213595499958
xy = 2.23606797749979 (should be 2.23606797749979)
yz = 5.000000000000001 (should be 5)
xz = 8.94427190999916 (should be 8.94427190999916)
---. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the enumerated solutions, we see x takes values ±2. The positive solution matches when all variables are positive, while the negative solution matches when all are negative. The value 2 comes from T/(2√5) where T = 4√5, simplifying to 2.
