abbrev omnimath3412_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3412 (k : ℝ) : 
    (2 * k + 1 = 4 * k - 5) ↔ k = omnimath3412_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solving equation: 2k + 1 = 4k - 5
Step 1: Subtract 2k from both sides
1 = 2k - 5
Step 2: Add 5 to both sides
6 = 2k
Step 3: Divide both sides by 2
k = 3.0

Verification:
Left side (2k + 1): 7.0
Right side (4k - 5): 7.0
Both sides equal: True. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
