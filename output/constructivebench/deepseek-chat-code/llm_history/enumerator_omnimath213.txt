This problem is about determining whether there exists a positive irrational number x such that for all sufficiently large n, the fractional parts of k*x for k=1..n are all at least 1/(n+1). The Lean theorem states this is equivalent to some answer (omnimath213_answer) which we need to conjecture.

We'll write a Python program to search for such numbers x by:
1. Testing various irrational numbers (π, e, √2, golden ratio, etc.)
2. For each x, checking the fractional part condition for increasing n
3. Printing x if it satisfies the condition for some N

```python
import math

def test_x(x, max_n=1000):
    """Check if x satisfies the condition for any N up to max_n"""
    for N in range(1, max_n):
        satisfied = True
        for n in range(N+1, max_n):
            for k in range(1, n+1):
                fract = k*x - math.floor(k*x)
                if fract < 1/(n+1):
                    satisfied = False
                    break
            if not satisfied:
                break
        if satisfied:
            print(f"Possible candidate: x = {x} satisfies condition for N = {N}")
            return True
    return False

# Test various irrational numbers
irrationals = [
    math.pi,
    math.e,
    math.sqrt(2),
    math.sqrt(3),
    math.sqrt(5),
    (1 + math.sqrt(5))/2,  # golden ratio
    math.log(2),
    math.log(3),
]

print("Testing irrational numbers for the condition:")
for x in irrationals:
    test_x(x)

print("\nTesting some rational numbers (should not satisfy condition):")
test_x(0.5)
test_x(1.0/3.0)
```
