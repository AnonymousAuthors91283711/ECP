theorem omnimath4043 :

Ground Truth Answer: {(a, a + 1) | a > 0}
Proposed Answer: {p : ℕ × ℕ | ∃ n : ℕ, p = (n, n + 1) ∧ n > 0}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a set of natural number pairs (a,b) where:
   - a > 0 and b > 0
   - 2a-1 and 2b+1 are coprime
   - (a+b) divides (4ab+1)

2. The ground truth answer states the solution is all pairs of the form (a, a+1) where a > 0.

3. The proposed answer states the solution is all pairs p where there exists n such that p = (n, n+1) and n > 0.

These are exactly the same sets expressed in different notations:
- The ground truth uses set builder notation {(a, a+1) | a > 0}
- The proposed answer uses {p | ∃ n, p = (n, n+1) ∧ n > 0}

Both describe exactly the same pairs where the second element is always one more than the first, and both are positive integers.
