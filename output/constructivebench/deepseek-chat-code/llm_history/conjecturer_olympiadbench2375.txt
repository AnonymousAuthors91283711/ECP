abbrev olympiadbench2375_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2375 (x : ℝ) :
    3^(x - 1) * 9^(3 / (2 * x^2)) = (27 : ℝ) ↔ x ∈ olympiadbench2375_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found solutions:
x ≈ 1.00000000

Verification:
For x ≈ 1.00000000, lhs = 27.00000000 (should be close to 27). Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
<<<{1, -1/2}>>>
