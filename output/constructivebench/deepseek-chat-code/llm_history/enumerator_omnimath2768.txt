The problem appears to be evaluating the expression `(3 * x + 2 * y) - (3 * x - 2 * y)` for given integer values x = -2 and y = -1. We can simplify this expression algebraically and then compute it for the given values.

The expression simplifies to:
(3x + 2y) - (3x - 2y) = 3x + 2y - 3x + 2y = 4y

Therefore, for any x and y, the result will always be 4y. For y = -1, this gives 4*(-1) = -4.

Here's a Python program that demonstrates this:

```python
def compute_expression(x, y):
    return (3 * x + 2 * y) - (3 * x - 2 * y)

# Given values from the problem
x = -2
y = -1

# Compute and print the result
result = compute_expression(x, y)
print(f"For x = {x}, y = {y}, the result is: {result}")

# Verification with simplified expression
simplified_result = 4 * y
print(f"Simplified expression (4y) gives: {simplified_result}")
```
