[write_program]
This problem involves an infinite series with terms combining exponential, factorial, and logarithmic components. We'll write a Python program to compute partial sums of this series for small values of t and k, to help understand its behavior.

The series is:
∑_{k=1}^∞ [1 - ∑_{n=0}^{k-1} (e^{-t} * t^n / n!)] * (1-p)^{k-1} * p
where p = ln(2)

We'll compute partial sums up to a reasonable k_max for sample t values.

```python
import math

def compute_partial_sum(t, k_max):
    p = math.log(2)
    total = 0.0
    for k in range(1, k_max + 1):
        # Compute inner sum from n=0 to k-1
        inner_sum = 0.0
        for n in range(k):
            term = math.exp(-t) * (t ** n) / math.factorial(n)
            inner_sum += term
        
        # Compute the term for this k
        term = (1 - inner_sum) * ((1 - p) ** (k - 1)) * p
        total += term
        
        # Print partial results for monitoring
        if k <= 10 or k % 10 == 0:
            print(f"t={t}, k={k}: partial_sum={total}")
    
    return total

# Sample t values to investigate
sample_ts = [0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0]
k_max = 50  # Sufficient for convergence with these t values

for t in sample_ts:
    print(f"\nComputing for t = {t}")
    final_sum = compute_partial_sum(t, k_max)
    print(f"Final sum for t={t}: {final_sum}")
```
