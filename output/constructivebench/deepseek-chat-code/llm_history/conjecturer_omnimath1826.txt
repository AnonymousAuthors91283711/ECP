. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℂ)
The errors occur because:
1. `I` needs to be written as `Complex.I` in Lean
2. The set construction syntax needs proper type annotations
3. Complex numbers should be constructed using `Complex.mk`

From the enumerated answers, we see roots are:
- 1 (real)
- 3/2 ± (√3/2)i
- 1/2 ± (√3/2)i

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<{1, Complex.mk (3/2) ((Real.sqrt 3)/2), Complex.mk (3/2) (-(Real.sqrt 3)/2), Complex.mk (1/2) ((Real.sqrt 3)/2), Complex.mk (1/2) (-(Real.sqrt 3)/2)}>>>

Explanation:
1. Used `Complex.mk` to construct complex numbers
2. Replaced `I` with proper complex number construction
3. Used `Real.sqrt` for square roots
4. Maintained exact fractions rather than decimal approximations
5. The set contains all roots of the polynomial as seen in the enumeration
