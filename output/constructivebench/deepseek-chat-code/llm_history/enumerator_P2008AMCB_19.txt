This problem involves finding the minimum value of |α| + |γ| for complex numbers α and γ such that two conditions on the imaginary parts of a quadratic function are satisfied. We'll approach this by:

1. Translating the conditions into equations
2. Solving for α and γ in terms of real parameters
3. Enumerating possible minimal combinations

The conditions are:
- The imaginary part of (4+i)*1² + α*1 + γ is 0
- The imaginary part of (4+i)*i² + α*i + γ is 0

We'll implement this by:
1. Expanding the conditions into real equations
2. Parameterizing possible solutions
3. Calculating |α| + |γ| for candidate solutions
4. Finding the minimal value

```python
import cmath
import math

def find_min_sum():
    min_sum = float('inf')
    best_params = None
    
    # The conditions translate to:
    # (1) Im(α) + Im(γ) = -1 (from first condition)
    # (2) Re(α) - Im(α) + Im(γ) = 4 (from second condition)
    
    # Let α = a + bi, γ = c + di
    # From (1): b + d = -1
    # From (2): a - b + d = 4
    
    # We can express d = -1 - b from (1)
    # Substitute into (2): a - b -1 -b = 4 => a -2b = 5 => a = 5 + 2b
    
    # Now α = (5+2b) + bi, γ = c + (-1-b)i
    # We need to minimize |α| + |γ| = sqrt((5+2b)^2 + b^2) + sqrt(c^2 + (-1-b)^2)
    
    # Since c doesn't appear in the conditions, we can minimize by setting c=0
    # So now we just need to find b that minimizes the expression
    
    # Scan possible b values around the likely minimum
    step = 0.001
    for b in [x * step for x in range(-1000, 1001)]:
        a = 5 + 2*b
        d = -1 - b
        c = 0  # since it's free to choose
        
        alpha = complex(a, b)
        gamma = complex(c, d)
        
        current_sum = abs(alpha) + abs(gamma)
        
        if current_sum < min_sum:
            min_sum = current_sum
            best_params = (a, b, c, d)
            print(f"New min: {min_sum:.5f} at α={alpha}, γ={gamma}")
    
    print(f"\nFinal minimal sum: {min_sum:.10f}")
    print(f"Achieved with α = {best_params[0]:.5f} + {best_params[1]:.5f}i")
    print(f"             γ = {best_params[2]:.5f} + {best_params[3]:.5f}i")

    find_min_sum()
