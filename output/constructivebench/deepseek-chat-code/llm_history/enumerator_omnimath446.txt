[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that the sum of squares from 1² to n² is divisible by 100. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal n by computing the sum of squares modulo 100 until we find the first n where the sum ≡ 0 mod 100.

The sum of squares formula is n(n+1)(2n+1)/6. We'll compute this modulo 100 efficiently by tracking the sum incrementally.

```python
def find_min_n():
    total = 0
    for n in range(1, 1000):  # arbitrary upper bound
        total = (total + n * n) % 100
        if total == 0:
            print(f"Found candidate: {n}")
            return n
    print("No solution found in range")
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_n()
```
