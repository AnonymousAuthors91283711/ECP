[write_program]
This problem involves finding integer pairs (a, b) such that the polynomial X² + aX + b divides a certain polynomial with coefficients alternating between -1 and 1, ending with two 1's. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible (a, b) pairs by checking small integer values.

The approach:
1. Generate polynomials of the form X² + aX + b for small integer values of a and b
2. For each such polynomial, check if it divides any polynomial of the form described in the problem
3. Since the problem involves infinite possibilities, we'll limit our search to reasonable bounds

```python
def main():
    # We'll search for a and b in this range
    min_val = -10
    max_val = 10
    
    # Maximum degree of the dividend polynomial to check
    max_n = 20
    
    found_pairs = set()
    
    for a in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
        for b in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
            if b == 0:
                continue  # X² + aX can't divide our target polynomial
            
            # Check for n from 2 to max_n (since divisor is degree 2)
            for n in range(2, max_n + 1):
                # Create the dividend polynomial coefficients
                coeffs = []
                for i in range(n + 1):
                    if i == n:
                        coeffs.append(1)
                    elif i == n - 1:
                        coeffs.append(1)
                    else:
                        coeffs.append((-1)**i)
                
                # Check if X² + aX + b divides the polynomial
                # We'll use polynomial division to check
                # Start with the dividend coefficients
                dividend = coeffs.copy()
                # Synthetic division for quadratic divisor 1, a, b
                if len(dividend) < 3:
                    continue
                
                # Perform polynomial division
                quotient = []
                try:
                    for i in range(len(dividend) - 2):
                        q = dividend[i]
                        quotient.append(q)
                        dividend[i+1] -= q * a
                        dividend[i+2] -= q * b
                    
                    # Check if remainder is zero
                    if dividend[-2] == 0 and dividend[-1] == 0:
                        found_pairs.add((a, b))
                        print(f"Found pair (a, b) = ({a}, {b}) for n = {n}")
                        break
                except IndexError:
                    continue
