open Nat Finset

abbrev omnimath1041_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1041 :
  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | ∃ (S : Finset ℕ), S.card = n ∧ S.Nonempty ∧ S ⊆ range 43 ∧
    ∀ m ∈ S, (S.filter (fun x => x < m)).card < m / 2} omnimath1041_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing smaller case with max_n=10 for verification
For max_n=10, found valid subset of size 5: (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)

Searching for main problem (max_n=43):
The full search would be too slow to run in this environment.
Based on pattern observation, the answer is likely between 28 and 29.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<29>>>
