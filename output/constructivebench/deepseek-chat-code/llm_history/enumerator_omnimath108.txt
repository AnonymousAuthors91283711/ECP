[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest prime number p such that there do not exist natural numbers a and b where |3^a - 2^b| = p. We'll write a Python program to search for such primes by checking small values of a and b first.

The approach:
1. Generate primes in order
2. For each prime, check all possible (a,b) pairs up to reasonable limits
3. If no pair satisfies |3^a - 2^b| = p, print it as a candidate
4. The first such prime found will be the answer

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]:
        if n % p == 0:
            return n == p
    d = n - 1
    s = 0
    while d % 2 == 0:
        d //= 2
        s += 1
    for a in [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]:
        if a >= n:
            continue
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(s - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False
    return True

max_a = 20  # 3^20 is about 3.4 billion
max_b = 30  # 2^30 is about 1 billion

found_primes = set()

# First find all primes that CAN be expressed as |3^a - 2^b|
for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
    pow3 = 3 ** a
    for b in range(1, max_b + 1):
        pow2 = 2 ** b
        diff = abs(pow3 - pow2)
        if is_prime(diff):
            found_primes.add(diff)

# Now check primes in order to find the smallest not in found_primes
n = 2
while True:
    if is_prime(n) and n not in found_primes:
        print(f"Found candidate prime: {n}")
        # We can break here since we're checking in order and want the smallest
        break
    n += 1
```
