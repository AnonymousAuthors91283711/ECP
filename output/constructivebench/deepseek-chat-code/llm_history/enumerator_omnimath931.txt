This problem involves finding the product e*f given two conditions: e/f = 3/4 and sqrt(e² + f²) = 15. We'll solve it by expressing everything in terms of one variable and computing the product.

The approach is:
1. From e/f = 3/4, express e = (3/4)f
2. Substitute into the second equation and solve for f
3. Compute e from the first relation
4. Calculate the product e*f

```python
import math

def solve():
    # From e/f = 3/4, we can express e = (3/4)f
    # Substitute into sqrt(e² + f²) = 15:
    # sqrt((9/16)f² + f²) = 15
    # sqrt((25/16)f²) = 15
    # (5/4)|f| = 15
    # |f| = 12
    # So f = 12 or f = -12
    
    for f in [12, -12]:
        e = (3/4) * f
        product = e * f
        print(f"e = {e}, f = {f}, e*f = {product}")

    # The problem likely expects positive values
    print("For positive values:")
    e = 9
    f = 12
    print(f"Final answer (e*f): {e*f}")
