abbrev omnimath1347_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath1347 :
  (∑ i in Finset.range 14, ((2*i + 3)/(i^2*(i + 1)^2) : ℚ)) = omnimath1347_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 224/225
Proposed Answer: (1 : ℚ) - (1 / (14 + 1)^2)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to evaluate the sum from i=1 to 14 of (2i+3)/(i²(i+1)²) as a rational number.

2. The ground truth answer is 224/225.

3. The proposed answer is 1 - 1/(14+1)² = 1 - 1/225 = 224/225.

4. Let's verify the proposed answer:
   - 1 - 1/(14+1)² = 1 - 1/225 = (225-1)/225 = 224/225
   - This exactly matches the ground truth answer.

The proposed answer is indeed equivalent to the ground truth answer, just written in a different form. The simplification shows they are identical.
