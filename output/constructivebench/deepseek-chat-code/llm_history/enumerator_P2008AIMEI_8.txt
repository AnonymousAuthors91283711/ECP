[write_program]
The problem asks to find the smallest positive integer n such that the sum of arctangents of 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, and 1/n equals π/4. We'll write a Python program to search for such n by:

1. Calculating the target value (π/4 minus the sum of three known arctangents)
2. For each candidate n, checking if arctan(1/n) matches the target
3. Using floating point approximations with a tolerance for comparison
4. Outputting candidates as they're found and finally the minimal solution

```python
import math

def find_min_n():
    # Calculate target = π/4 - (arctan(1/3) + arctan(1/4) + arctan(1/5))
    target = math.pi/4 - (math.atan(1/3) + math.atan(1/4) + math.atan(1/5))
    tolerance = 1e-10
    min_n = None
    
    # Search up to n=1000 (problem suggests solution exists)
    for n in range(1, 1001):
        current = math.atan(1/n)
        if abs(current - target) < tolerance:
            print(f"Found candidate: n = {n}")
            if min_n is None or n < min_n:
                min_n = n
    
    if min_n is not None:
        print(f"Minimal solution: n = {min_n}")
    else:
        print("No solution found in range")

find_min_n()
```
