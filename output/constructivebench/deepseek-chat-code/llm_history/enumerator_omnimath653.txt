[write_program]
This problem asks for the count of integers k between 1 and 2004 such that there exist positive integers m and n satisfying k = (m*n + 1)/(m + n). We'll write a Python program to enumerate all valid k values in this range.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible m and n values up to a reasonable limit (since m and n can't be too large without making k exceed 2004)
2. For each (m,n) pair, compute k and check if it's an integer in the range [1,2004]
3. Collect all unique valid k values and count them

```python
def solve():
    max_k = 2004
    seen = set()
    # We limit m and n to 2*max_k since beyond that k becomes approximately n/2 or m/2
    # which would exceed max_k for m,n > 2*max_k
    limit = 2 * max_k
    
    for m in range(1, limit + 1):
        for n in range(1, limit + 1):
            numerator = m * n + 1
            denominator = m + n
            if numerator % denominator == 0:
                k = numerator // denominator
                if 1 <= k <= max_k:
                    seen.add(k)
    
    # Print all found k values in order
    for k in sorted(seen):
        print(k)
    
    # Print the final count
    print(f"Total count: {len(seen)}")

solve()
```
