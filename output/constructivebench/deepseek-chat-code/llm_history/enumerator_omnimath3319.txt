This problem involves computing the product of sine terms with specific arguments. The key observation is that the arguments are symmetric around π/2, and we can pair terms to simplify the product. The exact value can be derived using properties of sine and product identities.

Here's a Python program to compute the product numerically for verification:

```python
import math

def compute_product(n):
    """Compute the product of sin(2π(k+1)/(2n+1)) for k from 0 to n-1"""
    product = 1.0
    for k in range(n):
        angle = 2 * math.pi * (k + 1) / (2 * n + 1)
        product *= math.sin(angle)
    return product

# For the problem, n = 2004 (since 4009 = 2*2004 + 1)
n = 2004
# Compute the product numerically
result = compute_product(n)
# Print the numerical result
print(f"Numerical product for n={n}: {result}")
print(f"2^(-n) = {2**(-n)}")
```

The program computes the product numerically and compares it with 2^(-n), which is the expected exact value based on mathematical analysis of such products. The output shows both the computed product and the theoretical value for comparison.
