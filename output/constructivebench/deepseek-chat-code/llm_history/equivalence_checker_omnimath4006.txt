Ground Truth Answer: {1, 13, 43, 91, 157}
Proposed Answer: {n | ∃ k, n = 9*k^2 + 3*k + 1}
Let's analyze the proposed answer and compare it to the ground truth.

The ground truth gives specific numbers: {1, 13, 43, 91, 157}

The proposed answer gives a general form: n = 9k² + 3k + 1

Let's test the proposed form for k = 0 to 4:
- k=0: 9*0 + 3*0 + 1 = 1
- k=1: 9*1 + 3*1 + 1 = 13
- k=2: 9*4 + 3*2 + 1 = 36 + 6 + 1 = 43
- k=3: 9*9 + 3*3 + 1 = 81 + 9 + 1 = 91
- k=4: 9*16 + 3*4 + 1 = 144 + 12 + 1 = 157

These exactly match the ground truth answer. The proposed answer gives a general formula that generates all the numbers in the ground truth set when k ranges from 0 to 4.
