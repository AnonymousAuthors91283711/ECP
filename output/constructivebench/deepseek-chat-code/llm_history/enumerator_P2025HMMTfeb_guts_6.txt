This problem involves an equilateral triangle ABC with points D on BC, and points E, F on rays from A through C and B respectively, such that D is the midpoint of EF. We need to find the length of EF given BD=1 and DC=4.

We'll approach this by:
1. Setting up coordinates for the equilateral triangle ABC
2. Parameterizing D's position on BC
3. Finding coordinates for E and F based on D being midpoint
4. Calculating EF distance

```python
import math

def solve():
    # Let's place ABC as an equilateral triangle with side length 5 (since BD+DC=5)
    side_length = 5.0
    # Place A at (0,0), B at (5,0), C at (2.5, 5*âˆš3/2)
    A = (0.0, 0.0)
    B = (5.0, 0.0)
    C = (2.5, 5 * math.sqrt(3)/2)
    
    # D divides BC in ratio BD:DC = 1:4
    t = 1/5  # parameter for D's position (since BD=1, DC=4)
    D = ((1-t)*B[0] + t*C[0], (1-t)*B[1] + t*C[1])
    
    # Since D is midpoint of EF, we can express E and F in terms of D
    # E is on ray AC: A + s*(C-A)
    # F is on ray AB: A + t*(B-A)
    # D = (E + F)/2
    
    # Let's set up equations:
    # Dx = (Ex + Fx)/2 = (s*Cx + t*Bx)/2
    # Dy = (Ey + Fy)/2 = (s*Cy + t*By)/2
    
    # Since By=0, second equation simplifies to s*Cy = 2*Dy
    s = 2 * D[1] / C[1]
    
    # From first equation: t*Bx = 2*Dx - s*Cx
    t = (2 * D[0] - s * C[0]) / B[0]
    
    # Now compute E and F coordinates
    E = (s * C[0], s * C[1])
    F = (t * B[0], t * B[1])
    
    # Calculate EF distance
    dx = E[0] - F[0]
    dy = E[1] - F[1]
    distance = math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)
    
    print(f"EF distance: {distance}")
