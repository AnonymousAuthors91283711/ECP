Ground Truth Answer: {abc : ℚ × ℚ × ℚ | let (a, b, c) := abc; a + b + c = 1}
Proposed Answer: { (a, b, c) : ℚ × ℚ × ℚ | ∃ k : ℤ, a = (2*k + 1)/2 ∧ b = k/2 ∧ c = (-k - 1)/2 }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a function f that rounds real numbers to integers using a specific rounding rule (rounding 0.5 cases to either floor or floor+1).

2. The theorem states that for all rational triples (a,b,c) where a > b > c and for all integers n, f(n*a) + f(n*b) + f(n*c) = n, then (a,b,c) must be in the solution set.

3. The ground truth answer says the solution is all triples where a + b + c = 1.

4. The proposed answer gives a specific parametric form for the triples.

Now let's check if they're equivalent:

- For the proposed answer, if we take any triple (a,b,c) in that form:
  a + b + c = (2k+1)/2 + k/2 + (-k-1)/2 = (2k+1 + k -k -1)/2 = (2k)/2 = k
  But the ground truth requires a+b+c=1, so k must be 1.

- The proposed answer includes all cases where k is any integer, but only k=1 satisfies a+b+c=1.

- The proposed answer is more general than needed, containing many triples that don't satisfy the condition.

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
