  let prizeDoors := 2
  let totalCases := 7 * (choose 5 2)   let favorableCases := 5 * (choose 4 2)   favorableCases / totalCases = omnimath531_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: 3/7. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 9 column 39, which is at "let favorableCases :" in "  let totalCases := 7 * (choose 5 2)   let favorableCases := 5 * (choose 4 2)   favorableCases / totalCases = omnimath531_answer := by sorry", there is an error: expected ';' or line break.

From the problem context and error message, I can see this is a probability problem involving combinations. The error appears to be a syntax issue with multiple let declarations on one line without proper separators. The enumerated answer suggests the probability is 3/7.

Looking at the components:
- doors = 7
- prizeDoors = 2
- totalCases = 7 * C(5,2) = 7 * 10 = 70
- favorableCases = 5 * C(4,2) = 5 * 6 = 30
- Probability = favorableCases/totalCases = 30/70 = 3/7

The pattern suggests we're calculating the probability of selecting prize doors in some configuration. The answer should be the simplified fraction 3/7.
