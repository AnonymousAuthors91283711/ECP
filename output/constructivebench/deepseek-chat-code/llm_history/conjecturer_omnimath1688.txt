theorem omnimath1688 (x : ℕ) :
    ∃ (a : ℕ → ℕ), g x = x^(2^2009) + a (2^2009 - 1) * x^(2^2009 - 1) + 
      Finset.sum (Finset.range (2^2009 - 1)) (fun i => a i * x^i) ∧ 
      a (2^2009 - 1) = omnimath1688_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Iterations: 1, Coefficient of x^1: 2
Iterations: 2, Coefficient of x^3: 4
Iterations: 3, Coefficient of x^7: 8
Iterations: 4, Coefficient of x^15: 16
Iterations: 5, Coefficient of x^31: 32. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the pattern in the enumerated answers, we observe that for n iterations, the coefficient of x^(2^n-1) is 2^n. Since the problem asks for the coefficient when n=2009, we generalize this pattern.
