This problem asks for the count of integers n between 1 and 2016 (inclusive) such that 720 divides the expression 1 + n + sum_{i=1}^6 (n^i / i!). The expression simplifies to e^n truncated at the 6th term. We need to find all n where this polynomial evaluates to an integer divisible by 720.

Key observations:
1. 720 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5
2. The polynomial can be rewritten as (n^6 + 6n^5 + 30n^4 + 120n^3 + 360n^2 + 720n + 720)/720
3. We need to find n where numerator â‰¡ 0 mod 720

We'll enumerate n from 1 to 2016 and check the divisibility condition.

```python
def main():
    count = 0
    for n in range(1, 2017):
        # Compute numerator: n^6 + 6n^5 + 30n^4 + 120n^3 + 360n^2 + 720n + 720
        n2 = n * n
        n3 = n2 * n
        n4 = n3 * n
        n5 = n4 * n
        n6 = n5 * n
        numerator = n6 + 6*n5 + 30*n4 + 120*n3 + 360*n2 + 720*n + 720
        if numerator % 720 == 0:
            count += 1
            print(n)  # Stream found solutions
    print("Total count:", count)  # Final answer

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
