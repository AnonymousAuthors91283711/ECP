This problem asks for the number of integer pairs (x,y) where 0 < x < y < 10^6 and (x+y)/2 = 2 + sqrt(x*y). We'll approach this by:
1. Rewriting the equation to eliminate the square root
2. Finding a parameterization of the solutions
3. Counting valid pairs up to 10^6

The key observation is that the equation resembles the arithmetic-geometric mean relationship. Let's rewrite it as:
(x+y)/2 - 2 = sqrt(x*y)
Square both sides and rearrange to get:
(x-4)(y-4) = 16

This shows solutions must be pairs where (x-4) and (y-4) are factors of 16 with x < y. We'll enumerate all factor pairs (d,16/d) where d divides 16 and d < 16/d.

```python
def count_pairs():
    count = 0
    # Enumerate all positive divisors d of 16 where d < 16/d
    for d in [1, 2, 4]:
        x = 4 + d
        y = 4 + 16 // d
        if x < y and y < 10**6:
            count += 1
            print(f"Found pair: ({x}, {y})")
    # Also consider negative divisors (though x must be positive)
    for d in [-16, -8, -4, -2, -1]:
        x = 4 + d
        y = 4 + 16 // d
        if 0 < x < y and y < 10**6:
            count += 1
            print(f"Found pair: ({x}, {y})")
    print(f"Total pairs: {count}")

count_pairs()
```
