. Enumerated Answers: Product verification: 2015.9999999999127 (should be 2016)
Required sum: 4031.999999999826. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Looking at the problem and errors, I notice:
1. The proposed answer uses variable 'a' but it's not defined in the abbreviation
2. The enumerated answers suggest the sum should be around 4032
3. The problem involves geometric series sums: ∑' a^n = 1/(1-a) and ∑' (-a)^n = 1/(1+a)
4. The product condition gives (1/(1-a))*(1/(1+a)) = 2016 → 1/(1-a²) = 2016
5. The required sum is 1/(1-a) + 1/(1+a) = (2)/(1-a²)

From the enumerated answer (≈4032) and the math (2*2016=4032), the solution should be constant 4032 since 1/(1-a²)=2016 from the condition.

The error occurs because we can't use 'a' in the abbreviation - the answer must be a constant. Here's the fixed version:

<<<(4032 : ℝ)>>>

Explanation:
- The product condition gives 1/(1-a²) = 2016
- The required sum is 2/(1-a²) = 2*2016 = 4032
- Since this is constant for all valid a, we can just return 4032
- The type annotation ensures it's treated as a real number
