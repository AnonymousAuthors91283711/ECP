[write_program]
This problem involves counting reachable positions on a 100x100 grid starting from (1,1) with moves that change one coordinate by 1 and the other by k (or vice versa). We'll write a Python program to enumerate reachable positions for small k values to help conjecture the pattern.

The program will:
1. Simulate the reachable positions using BFS
2. Track visited positions
3. Print the count of reachable positions for sample k values
4. Handle the grid bounds (1-100)

```python
from collections import deque

def count_reachable(k):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque()
    queue.append((1, 1))
    visited.add((1, 1))
    
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        # Generate all possible moves
        for dx, dy in [(1, k), (-1, k), (1, -k), (-1, -k),
                       (k, 1), (-k, 1), (k, -1), (-k, -1)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 1 <= nx <= 100 and 1 <= ny <= 100 and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    return len(visited)

# Test for sample k values in the range 51-99
for k in [51, 52, 53, 60, 75, 99]:
    print(f"k={k}, reachable positions:", count_reachable(k))
```
