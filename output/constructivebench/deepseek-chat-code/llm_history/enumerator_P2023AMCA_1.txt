[write_program]
This problem involves solving a simple linear equation to find the value of t, then computing 18*t as the final answer. We'll write a Python program that:
1. Solves the equation 18t + 12t = 45 for t
2. Computes the value of 18t
3. Outputs the exact value as a fraction and its decimal approximation

The solution is straightforward since it's just solving one equation, but we'll implement it properly with exact rational arithmetic.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve_problem():
    # Solve 18t + 12t = 45 => 30t = 45 => t = 45/30 = 3/2
    t = Fraction(45, 30)
    simplified_t = Fraction(3, 2)  # simplified form
    
    # Calculate 18t
    answer = 18 * simplified_t
    
    # Output exact value and decimal approximation
    print(f"Exact value: {answer}")
    print(f"Decimal approximation: {float(answer)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_problem()
```
