Ground Truth Answer: 18
Proposed Answer: 16
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. From the conditions:
   - a > 0, b > 0, c > 0
   - a = b
   - a * b * c = 128

2. Since a = b, we can rewrite the product as:
   a² * c = 128

3. We need to find natural numbers a and c that satisfy this equation. Let's find possible factor pairs:
   - a=1: 1 * c = 128 ⇒ c=128 ⇒ sum=1+1+128=130
   - a=2: 4 * c = 128 ⇒ c=32 ⇒ sum=2+2+32=36
   - a=4: 16 * c = 128 ⇒ c=8 ⇒ sum=4+4+8=16
   - a=8: 64 * c = 128 ⇒ c=2 ⇒ sum=8+8+2=18

4. The ground truth answer is 18 (which comes from a=8, b=8, c=2)
5. The proposed answer is 16 (which comes from a=4, b=4, c=8)

While both sums are possible solutions to the equation, the problem doesn't specify which solution to choose when multiple exist. However, typically in such problems we look for all possible solutions or the minimal/maximal one. Since both are valid solutions but different, they are not equivalent.
