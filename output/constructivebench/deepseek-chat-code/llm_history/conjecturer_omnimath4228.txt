n = 19: no solution found in x ∈ [-10, 10]
n = 20: no solution found in x ∈ [-10, 10]. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
From the enumeration, only n=1 has a solution (x=-4). For all other tested n (2-20), no solutions exist in the checked range. The pattern suggests the equation only holds when n=1. Thus, the answer is the singleton set containing 1.
