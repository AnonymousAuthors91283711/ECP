open Nat Set

abbrev omnimath4314_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath4314 :
  {(x, y, z) : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ | x > 0 ∧ y > 0 ∧ z > 0 ∧ 3 ^ x - 5 ^ y = z ^ 2} = omnimath4314_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for solutions with x up to 20
Found solution: (x=2, y=1, z=2). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)
<<<{(2, 1, 2)}>>>
