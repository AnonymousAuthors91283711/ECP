This problem asks for the number of integers x where the absolute value of x is less than 3π. Since 3π ≈ 9.424, we need to count all integers from -9 to 9 inclusive (as |x| must be ≤ 9 to satisfy |x| < 9.424). The solution involves counting these integers efficiently.

Here's a Python program that calculates and verifies this count:

```python
import math

def count_integers_less_than_3pi():
    threshold = 3 * math.pi
    max_int = int(threshold)  # This gives 9 since 3π ≈ 9.424
    if max_int >= threshold:  # Handle edge case if threshold is exact integer
        max_int -= 1
    count = 2 * max_int + 1  # Counts from -max_int to max_int inclusive
    print(f"Counting integers x where |x| < {threshold:.3f}")
    print(f"Integer range: [{-max_int}, {max_int}]")
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

count_integers_less_than_3pi()
```
