Ground Truth Answer: 0.1085859
Proposed Answer: 1251389484714925378302382723774474742882671 / 11524415215919881415682371989359749714522280
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is a fraction that evaluates to approximately 0.1085859 when calculated, which matches the ground truth answer of 0.1085859. However, the proposed answer is given in exact fractional form rather than the decimal approximation provided as the ground truth. The values are numerically equivalent, but the representations differ. Therefore, the answers are "Close" since they represent the same value but in different forms.
