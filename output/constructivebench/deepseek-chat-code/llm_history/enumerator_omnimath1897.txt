[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number `n` such that the sum of harmonic series up to `n` exceeds 5. We'll write a Python program to find this number by incrementally calculating partial sums of the harmonic series until the sum exceeds 5.

```python
def find_harmonic_threshold(target):
    total = 0.0
    n = 1
    while True:
        total += 1.0 / n
        if total > target:
            print(f"n = {n}, partial sum = {total}")
            return n
        n += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    target = 5.0
    print(f"Finding smallest n where harmonic sum > {target}")
    result = find_harmonic_threshold(target)
    print(f"Final answer: {result}")
```
