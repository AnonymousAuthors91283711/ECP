[write_program]
This problem asks for positive integers L where the sum S(L) = floor(1/2) + floor(2/2) + ... + floor(L/2) is a perfect square. We'll write a Python program to enumerate such L values up to a reasonable threshold.

The approach:
1. Compute S(L) efficiently using the observation that floor(n/2) alternates between k-1 and k for n=2k-1 and n=2k
2. Check if S(L) is a perfect square
3. Output all valid L values found

```python
import math

def find_valid_L(max_L=1000):
    S = 0
    for L in range(1, max_L + 1):
        # Compute S(L) incrementally: floor(L/2) added to previous sum
        S += L // 2
        # Check if perfect square
        root = math.isqrt(S)
        if root * root == S:
            print(f"Found L = {L} with S(L) = {S} = {root}^2")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Searching for L where S(L) is perfect square:")
    find_valid_L()
```
