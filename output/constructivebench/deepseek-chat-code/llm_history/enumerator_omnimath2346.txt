This problem involves calculating the expected size of a non-empty subset of a set with 8 elements. The expected value is defined as the sum of sizes of all non-empty subsets divided by the number of non-empty subsets.

We'll compute this by:
1. Calculating the total number of non-empty subsets (2^8 - 1 = 255)
2. Calculating the sum of sizes of all non-empty subsets
3. Dividing the sum by the count to get the expected value

The sum of sizes can be computed by recognizing that each element appears in exactly half of all subsets (2^(n-1) subsets), and there are 8 elements.

```python
def expected_subset_size(n):
    total_subsets = 2**n - 1  # exclude empty set
    sum_sizes = n * (2**(n-1))  # each element appears in 2^(n-1) subsets
    return sum_sizes / total_subsets

# For n=8 as in the problem
n = 8
result = expected_subset_size(n)
print(f"For n={n}, expected subset size = {result}")
print(f"Exact fraction: {8*128}/255 = {8*128/255}")
```
