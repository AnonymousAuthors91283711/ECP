Ground Truth Answer: {153, 370, 371, 407}
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | ∃ a b c : ℕ, n = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 ∧ n = 100*a + 10*b + c}

The proposed answer describes the set of numbers that are equal to the sum of the cubes of their digits (3-digit narcissistic numbers). While this correctly captures the property that defines the numbers in the ground truth answer (153, 370, 371, 407), it's not exactly equivalent because:
1. The proposed answer is a description of the property rather than an explicit enumeration
2. The ground truth answer is the exact set of numbers that satisfy this property
3. The proposed answer would be equivalent if we could prove it only contains these 4 numbers

The answers are mathematically related but not identical in form. The proposed answer is correct in spirit but not in precise form.
