This problem involves finding the smallest positive integer k such that the product of the first k terms of a recursive sequence is an integer. The sequence is defined with real numbers, but we need exact values when possible. We'll compute the sequence terms symbolically and check when their product becomes an integer.

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_sequence(n):
    """Compute the n-th term of the sequence symbolically as 2^exponent"""
    if n == 0:
        return Fraction(0, 1)  # 2^0 = 1
    elif n == 1:
        return Fraction(1, 19)  # 2^(1/19)
    else:
        return compute_sequence(n-1) + 2 * compute_sequence(n-2)

def check_product(k):
    """Check if product of first k terms is integer by summing exponents"""
    total_exp = Fraction(0, 1)
    for i in range(1, k+1):  # terms from a_1 to a_k
        total_exp += compute_sequence(i)
    return total_exp.denominator == 1

def main():
    max_k = 100  # reasonable upper bound
    for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
        if check_product(k):
            print(f"Found k = {k} where product is integer")
            # No early exit as we want to see all possible k
    # After enumeration, we can see the minimal k is printed first

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
