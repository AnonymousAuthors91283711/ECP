theorem omnimath3761 (n : ℕ) (P Q : ℝ[X]) 
  (hP : P.degree ≤ n) (hQ : Q.degree ≤ n)
  (h : ∀ x, eval x (P * X^(n+1) + Q * (X + 1)^(n+1)) = 1) :
  eval (-1/2) Q = omnimath3761_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 
n = 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℝ
Looking at the pattern from enumerated answers and considering the problem's structure involving polynomials and evaluation at -1/2, the solution likely involves powers of 2. The answer appears to be 2 raised to the power of (2n+1).
