Based on the problem statement, we're looking for the greatest natural number n where there exists a 9×9 grid (Fin 9 × Fin 9 → Fin 9) that satisfies:
1. Bijectivity in rows
2. Bijectivity in columns
3. Bijectivity in each 3×3 subgrid

This describes a Sudoku-like structure. The maximum number of distinct symbols in such a grid is 9 (since it's a Latin square with additional constraints).
