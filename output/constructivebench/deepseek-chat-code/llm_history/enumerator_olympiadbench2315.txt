[write_program]
This problem involves solving a quadratic equation derived from the given equation. We'll write a Python program to find the real root(s) of the equation within the specified range [0, 100]. The equation simplifies to a quadratic in terms of n, which we'll solve numerically while checking for valid solutions.

```python

    # The given equation simplifies to: (10*(1 + n/100)*75*(1 - n/100)) * (15*(1 + n/100)*75*(1 - n/100)) = 345600
    # Let's simplify it step by step:
    # First term: 10*75*(1 + n/100)*(1 - n/100) = 750*(1 - (n/100)^2)
    # Second term: 15*75*(1 + n/100)*(1 - n/100) = 1125*(1 - (n/100)^2)
    # Product: 750 * 1125 * (1 - (n/100)^2)^2 = 345600
    # Let x = (n/100)^2, then equation becomes: 750*1125*(1-x)^2 = 345600
    # Simplify: (1-x)^2 = 345600/(750*1125) = 345600/843750 ≈ 0.4096
    # So 1-x = ±0.64 → x = 1 ∓ 0.64 → x = 0.36 or x = 1.64
    # Since x = (n/100)^2 must be between 0 and 1, we take x = 0.36
    # Thus n/100 = ±0.6 → n = ±60 → only n=60 is in [0,100]
    
    # For verification, let's compute the value at n=60
    n = 60
    term1 = 10 * (1 + n/100) * 75 * (1 - n/100)
    term2 = 15 * (1 + n/100) * 75 * (1 - n/100)
    product = term1 * term2
    print(f"At n={n}, product={product} (should be 345600)")
    
    # The exact solution is n=60
    print("The solution is n = 60")
