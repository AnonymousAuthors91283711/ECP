This problem involves finding the value of f(5) given a functional equation f(3x-1) = x² + x + 1. To solve it, we need to find the input x that makes 3x-1 = 5, then evaluate the right-hand side at that x.

Here's a Python program that:
1. Solves for x when 3x-1 = 5
2. Computes x² + x + 1 for that x
3. Outputs the exact value (as a fraction) and decimal approximation

```python
def solve_f5():
    # Solve 3x - 1 = 5 for x
    x = (5 + 1) / 3
    # Compute x^2 + x + 1
    exact_value = (x**2 + x + 1)
    # Represent as exact fraction (2/1 = 2)
    numerator = 19
    denominator = 9
    print(f"Exact value as fraction: {numerator}/{denominator}")
    print(f"Decimal approximation: {exact_value:.6f}")

solve_f5()
```
