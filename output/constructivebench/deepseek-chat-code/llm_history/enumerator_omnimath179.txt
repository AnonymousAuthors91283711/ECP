This problem involves finding the greatest natural number `s` that can be expressed in terms of two sequences `a` and `b` with specific conditions. The sequence `a` is non-decreasing, `b` is defined as the smallest index where `a` reaches at least each value, `a(19)=85`, and `s` is a sum involving both sequences.

We'll approach this by:
1. Enumerating possible non-decreasing sequences `a` of length 20 (indices 0-19) where `a[19]=85`
2. For each valid `a`, compute the corresponding `b` sequence
3. Calculate the sum `s` and track the maximum value found

```python
def main():
    max_s = 0
    # We'll generate non-decreasing sequences a where a[19]=85
    # Using backtracking with pruning for efficiency
    def backtrack(a, pos):
        nonlocal max_s
        if pos == 19:
            if a[pos] != 85:
                return
            # Compute b sequence
            b = []
            m = 1
            while True:
                # Find smallest n where a[n] >= m
                found = None
                for n in range(20):
                    if a[n] >= m:
                        found = n
                        break
                if found is None:
                    break
                b.append(found)
                m += 1
                if m > 100:  # Safety limit
                    break
            
            # Compute the sum s
            sum_a = sum(a[1:20])  # a[1] to a[19]
            sum_b = sum(b[:85])   # b[1] to b[85] (0-indexed as b[0]=b1)
            s = sum_a + sum_b
            if s > max_s:
                max_s = s
                print(f"New max s: {s} with a={a}")
            return
        
        # Generate next element in sequence
        start_val = a[pos] if pos > 0 else 0
        for val in range(start_val, 86):
            a[pos+1] = val
            backtrack(a, pos+1)
    
    a = [0]*20
    backtrack(a, -1)
    print(f"Final maximum s: {max_s}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
