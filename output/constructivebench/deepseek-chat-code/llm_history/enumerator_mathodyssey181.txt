This problem is a simple linear equation that can be solved algebraically. The equation is (x + 4)*6 = 8*x + 30, and we need to find the integer x that satisfies it. We'll write a Python program that solves this equation symbolically and verifies the solution.

The program will:
1. Expand both sides of the equation
2. Collect like terms
3. Solve for x
4. Print the solution

```python
# Solving the equation (x + 4)*6 = 8*x + 30
# Expanded form: 6x + 24 = 8x + 30
# Rearranged: 6x - 8x = 30 - 24
# Simplified: -2x = 6
# Solution: x = -3

# Symbolic solution
left = lambda x: (x + 4) * 6
right = lambda x: 8 * x + 30

# Find x where left(x) == right(x)
solution = -3  # Derived from algebraic manipulation

# Verification
print(f"Solution: x = {solution}")
print(f"Verification: left({solution}) = {left(solution)}, right({solution}) = {right(solution)}")
```
