This problem involves finding the smallest integer k such that there exists a set of more than 200 points in ℤ×ℤ where every pair of points satisfies a certain area condition related to k. We'll approach this by:

1. Understanding the condition: The formula calculates twice the signed area of triangle ABC, which must equal k
2. Looking for point configurations where many pairs share this property
3. Enumerating small k values to find the minimal one that allows >200 points

The most promising configuration is points on a line (where area is always 0), but the condition requires A≠B. However, three colinear points would have pairwise area 0. So we need to find k where many points satisfy the area condition.

```python
def compute_area(A, B, C):
    """Compute 2*(area of triangle ABC) using determinant formula"""
    return (A[0] - C[0]) * (B[1] - C[1]) - (B[0] - C[0]) * (A[1] - C[1])

def test_k(k, max_points=201):
    """Check if k allows a set of >200 points where all pairs satisfy area condition"""
    # Try simple configurations first - points on a line
    # For k=0, any colinear points work (but problem requires A≠B)
    if k == 0:
        return max_points - 1  # All points on x-axis
    
    # For k≠0, try lattice points with fixed area
    # The minimal k allowing many points is likely small
    points = set()
    # Try points on parabola y = x^2 - this gives fixed area for certain C
    # Not guaranteed to work for all k, but helps find candidates
    for x in range(1, 1000):
        y = x * x
        points.add((x, y))
        if len(points) >= max_points:
            break
    
    # Check all pairs in the set
    if len(points) >= max_points:
        for A in points:
            for B in points:
                if A == B:
                    continue
                # Find C that makes area condition hold
                # This is simplified - actual condition is more complex
                found = False
                for C in [(0,0), (0,1), (1,0)]:  # Sample C points
                    if compute_area(A, B, C) == k:
                        found = True
                        break
                if not found:
                    break
            else:
                continue
            break
        else:
            return True
    return False

# Enumerate possible k values
for k in range(0, 10):
    if test_k(k):
        print(f"Found candidate k: {k}")
        # For minimal k, we can stop at first found
        print(f"Minimal k allowing >200 points: {k}")
        break
```
