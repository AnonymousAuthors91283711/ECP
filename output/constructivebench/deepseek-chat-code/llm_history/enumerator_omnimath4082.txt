This problem asks for all positive real-valued functions f defined on the positive reals that satisfy the functional equation:
f(x + f(y)) = f(x + y) + f(y) for all x,y > 0.

We'll enumerate possible solutions by testing common functional forms (linear, power functions, etc.) and checking if they satisfy the equation.

```python
def check_solution(f, tol=1e-6):
    """Check if function f satisfies the functional equation."""
    test_values = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.5, 1.5]  # Sample positive real values
    for x in test_values:
        for y in test_values:
            lhs = f(x + f(y))
            rhs = f(x + y) + f(y)
            if abs(lhs - rhs) > tol:
                return False
    return True

def test_linear():
    """Test linear functions f(y) = k*y."""
    print("Testing linear functions f(y) = k*y:")
    for k in [0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0]:  # Test different coefficients
        f = lambda y: k * y
        if check_solution(f):
            print(f"Found solution: f(y) = {k}*y")

def test_power():
    """Test power functions f(y) = y^k."""
    print("\nTesting power functions f(y) = y^k:")
    for k in [0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0]:  # Test different exponents
        f = lambda y: y ** k
        if check_solution(f):
            print(f"Found solution: f(y) = y^{k}")

def test_constant():
    """Test constant functions (though they violate f(y)>0 condition)."""
    print("\nTesting constant functions (should find none valid):")
    for c in [1.0, 2.0]:
        f = lambda y: c
        if check_solution(f):
            print(f"Found solution: f(y) = {c}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_linear()
    test_power()
    test_constant()
    print("\nAfter testing common forms, the only solutions found were linear functions.")
```
