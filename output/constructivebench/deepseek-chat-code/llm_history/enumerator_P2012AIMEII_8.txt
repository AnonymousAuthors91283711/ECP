This problem involves finding the minimum value of |z*w|^2 where z and w are 12th roots of unity satisfying a given condition. We'll enumerate all pairs of 12th roots of unity, check the condition, and compute |z*w|^2 for valid pairs to find the minimum.

```python
import cmath
import math

def solve():
    # Generate all 12th roots of unity
    roots = [cmath.exp(2j * math.pi * k / 12) for k in range(12)]
    
    min_norm_sq = float('inf')
    condition = 4 + 4j
    
    for z in roots:
        for w in roots:
            if z == -w:  # Avoid division by zero in condition check
                continue
            # Check if condition is satisfied
            lhs = z - w
            rhs = condition * (z + w)
            if cmath.isclose(lhs, rhs, rel_tol=1e-9, abs_tol=1e-9):
                norm_sq = abs(z * w) ** 2
                print(f"Found valid pair: z={z}, w={w}, |zw|²={norm_sq}")
                if norm_sq < min_norm_sq:
                    min_norm_sq = norm_sq
    
    print(f"\nMinimum |zw|² found: {min_norm_sq}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```
