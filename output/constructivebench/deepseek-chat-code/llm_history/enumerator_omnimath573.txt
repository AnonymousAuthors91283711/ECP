This problem involves calculating the optimal winning probability in a game with 3 boxes and a strategy that depends on two decisions. The goal is to enumerate all possible strategies and compute their winning probabilities to find the maximum.

We'll model the strategies as all possible functions from (Fin 2 × Fin 2) → Bool (since each strategy s takes two binary decisions and returns a boolean). There are 2^(2*2) = 16 possible strategies. For each strategy, we'll compute its winning probability and find the maximum.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    # The three boxes and their probabilities
    boxes = [
        (0, 0),  # Box 1: both decisions are 0
        (1, 1),  # Box 2: both decisions are 1
        (0, 1)   # Box 3: decisions differ
    ]
    prob_per_box = Fraction(1, 3)  # Each box has 1/3 probability
    
    max_prob = Fraction(0)
    
    # Enumerate all possible strategies (16 possibilities)
    for s00 in [False, True]:  # Strategy when both decisions are 0
        for s01 in [False, True]:  # Strategy when first decision is 0, second is 1
            for s10 in [False, True]:  # Strategy when first decision is 1, second is 0
                for s11 in [False, True]:  # Strategy when both decisions are 1
                    # Compute winning probability for this strategy
                    prob = Fraction(0)
                    
                    # Box 1: (0,0)
                    if (0,0) == boxes[0]:
                        prob += prob_per_box * (1 if s00 else 0)
                    
                    # Box 2: (1,1)
                    if (1,1) == boxes[1]:
                        prob += prob_per_box * (1 if s11 else 0)
                    
                    # Box 3: (0,1)
                    if (0,1) == boxes[2]:
                        prob += prob_per_box * (Fraction(1,2) if s01 else 0)
                    
                    # s10 is unused since we don't have (1,0) box
                    
                    print(f"Strategy (s00={s00}, s01={s01}, s10={s10}, s11={s11}): {prob}")
                    
                    if prob > max_prob:
                        max_prob = prob
    
    print("\nMaximum winning probability:", max_prob)
