[write_program]
This problem involves finding the sum of two distinct positive real numbers `a` and `b` that satisfy the equations `a - 1 = 1/a` and `b - 1 = 1/b`. We'll write a Python program to explore the solutions.

Approach:
1. The given equations can be rewritten as quadratic equations: `a² - a - 1 = 0` and `b² - b - 1 = 0`
2. We'll solve these equations and find their positive roots
3. Since a and b must be distinct, we'll take the two different positive roots
4. The sum a + b can be found using Vieta's formulas (sum of roots of x² - x - 1 = 0 is 1)

```python
import math

def find_roots():
    # Coefficients of x² - x - 1 = 0
    a_coeff = 1
    b_coeff = -1
    c_coeff = -1
    
    # Calculate discriminant
    discriminant = b_coeff**2 - 4*a_coeff*c_coeff
    
    if discriminant < 0:
        print("No real roots")
        return
    
    # Calculate both roots
    root1 = (-b_coeff + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a_coeff)
    root2 = (-b_coeff - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a_coeff)
    
    # Select positive roots (both are positive in this case)
    positive_roots = [r for r in (root1, root2) if r > 0]
    
    if len(positive_roots) < 2:
        print("Not enough positive roots")
        return
    
    a, b = positive_roots[0], positive_roots[1]
    
    # Print the roots and their sum
    print(f"Root 1 (a): {a}")
    print(f"Root 2 (b): {b}")
    print(f"Sum a + b: {a + b}")
    
    # Verify the original equations
    print(f"Verification for a: {a - 1} vs {1/a}")
    print(f"Verification for b: {b - 1} vs {1/b}")
