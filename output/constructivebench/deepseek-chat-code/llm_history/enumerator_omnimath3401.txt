[write_program]
This problem appears to be about finding a function `omnimath3401_answer` that satisfies the given theorem statement. The theorem states that for any real number p between 0 and 100, the set containing q = 100 - p (with q also between 0 and 100) equals the singleton set containing `omnimath3401_answer p`.

The solution is straightforward - the function should simply return 100 - p. I'll write a Python program that verifies this for sample values of p between 0 and 100.

```python
def omnimath3401_answer(p):
    return 100 - p

# Test the function with sample values
sample_values = [0, 25, 50, 75, 100]
for p in sample_values:
    q = omnimath3401_answer(p)
    print(f"For p = {p}: q = {q}")
    # Verify the conditions
    assert 0 <= q <= 100
    assert q == 100 - p
```
