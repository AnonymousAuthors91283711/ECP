  (omnimath2355_answer n) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=2: max vertices with degree ≥3 = 0
n=3: max vertices with degree ≥3 = 1
n=4: max vertices with degree ≥3 = 2
n=5: max vertices with degree ≥3 = 3
n=6: max vertices with degree ≥3 = 4
n=7: max vertices with degree ≥3 = 5
n=8: max vertices with degree ≥3 = 6
n=9: max vertices with degree ≥3 = 7
n=10: max vertices with degree ≥3 = 8

For n ≥ 2, the maximum number of vertices with degree ≥3 is n-2. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
