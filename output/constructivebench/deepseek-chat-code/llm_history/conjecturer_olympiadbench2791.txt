Based on the problem statement and the fact that no solutions were found in enumeration, this suggests the polynomial cannot be factored into four distinct linear terms with arithmetic progression roots. However, the problem requires an integer answer, so we must provide the constant term that makes the equation hold under the given constraints.

The key observation is that the polynomial must be expressible as a product of four distinct linear terms in arithmetic progression. For a quartic polynomial X⁴ + bX² + kX + 225, the constant term 225 must equal the product of the roots. The roots are in AP: (a-3d), (a-d), (a+d), (a+3d). Their product is (a²-9d²)(a²-d²) = 225.

The simplest integer solution occurs when a=0, making the product (9d²)(d²) = 9d⁴ = 225 ⇒ d⁴=25 ⇒ d²=5. Then the coefficient of X² is b = -10d² = -50.
