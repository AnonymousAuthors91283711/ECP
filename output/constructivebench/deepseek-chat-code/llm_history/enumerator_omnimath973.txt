[write_program]
This problem involves counting something based on a given formula for natural numbers, with a specific case when n=2005. We'll write a Python program to compute the count function for small values of n to observe the pattern, then compute it for n=2005.

The count function is defined as:
- count(0) = 1
- count(k) = 4^(k-1) + 2^(k-1) for k > 0

We'll compute this for small n values first to verify the pattern, then compute for n=2005.

```python
def count(k):
    if k == 0:
        return 1
    return (4 ** (k-1)) + (2 ** (k-1))

# First show small cases to observe pattern
print("Small cases:")
for n in range(0, 11):
    print(f"count({n}) = {count(n)}")

# Now compute for n=2005
n = 2005
result = count(n)
print(f"\ncount({n}) = {result}")
```
