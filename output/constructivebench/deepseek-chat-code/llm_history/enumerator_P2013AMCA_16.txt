This problem involves finding the maximum possible combined mean of groups B and C given certain conditions about their means and combined means with group A. We'll approach it by:

1. Setting up the equations based on the given means
2. Solving for the variables A and B in terms of totals
3. Expressing the combined mean of B and C in terms of these variables
4. Finding the maximum possible value for this mean

The key insight is that the mean of B and C is maximized when C is minimized (since C pulls the average down from B's higher mean).

```python
def solve_problem():
    # We'll iterate through possible values of A and B to find valid configurations
    # Since A and B must be positive integers satisfying the given conditions
    
    max_mean = 0
    best_abc = None
    
    # Iterate possible A values (from 1 to 100, arbitrary reasonable limit)
    for A in range(1, 101):
        # From meanA: totalA = 40*A
        totalA = 40 * A
        
        # From meanAB = 43 = (totalA + totalB)/(A+B)
        # We can express B in terms of totalB: B = (totalA + totalB)/43 - A
        # But also from meanB = 50 = totalB/B => totalB = 50*B
        # Substitute:
        # B = (40*A + 50*B)/43 - A
        # Solve for B in terms of A:
        # 43B = 40A + 50B - 43A
        # -7B = -3A => B = (3/7)*A
        
        # B must be integer, so A must be multiple of 7
        if A % 7 != 0:
            continue
            
        B = (3 * A) // 7
        if B <= 0:
            continue
            
        totalB = 50 * B
        
        # Now find C and totalC from meanAC = 44 = (totalA + totalC)/(A + C)
        # totalC = 44*(A + C) - totalA
        # But we want to maximize (totalB + totalC)/(B + C)
        # To maximize this, we need to minimize C (since B's mean is higher)
        # So set C = 1 (smallest possible positive integer)
        
        C = 1
        totalC = 44 * (A + C) - totalA
        
        # Calculate the mean of B and C
        current_mean = (totalB + totalC) / (B + C)
        
        print(f"A={A}, B={B}, C={C} -> mean BC = {current_mean}")
        
        if current_mean > max_mean:
            max_mean = current_mean
            best_abc = (A, B, C)
    
    print(f"\nMaximum mean of B and C: {max_mean}")
