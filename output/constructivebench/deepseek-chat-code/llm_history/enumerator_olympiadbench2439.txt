This problem involves solving a system of linear equations to find the set of real numbers x where f(x) = g(x). We'll solve the system symbolically to find expressions for f and g, then find where they are equal.

The approach is:
1. Solve the system of equations for f(x) and g(x)
2. Set f(x) = g(x) and solve for x
3. The solution set will be the roots of the resulting equation

```python
def solve_system():
    # We'll solve the system symbolically
    # Equation 1: f + 3g = x² + x + 6
    # Equation 2: 2f + 4g = 2x² + 4
    
    # Let's solve for f and g in terms of x
    # Multiply equation 1 by 2: 2f + 6g = 2x² + 2x + 12
    # Subtract equation 2: 2g = 2x + 8 => g = x + 4
    # Substitute back into equation 1: f = x² + x + 6 - 3(x + 4) = x² - 2x - 6
    
    # Now find where f(x) = g(x)
    # x² - 2x - 6 = x + 4
    # x² - 3x - 10 = 0
    # Solutions: x = [3 ± sqrt(9 + 40)]/2 = [3 ± 7]/2
    
    # The roots are x = 5 and x = -2
    print("The set of x where f(x) = g(x) is:", {-2.0, 5.0})
