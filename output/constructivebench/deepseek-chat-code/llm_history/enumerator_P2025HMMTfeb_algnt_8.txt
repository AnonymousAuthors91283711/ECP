[write_program]
This problem involves computing the sum of an infinite series where each term is the sign of sin(2^n) divided by 2^n. The sign function returns 1 for positive values, -1 for negative values, and 0 for zero. We'll write a Python program to compute partial sums of this series to observe convergence behavior.

The approach:
1. Compute sin(2^n) for increasing n
2. Determine its sign (1, -1, or 0)
3. Accumulate the term sign(sin(2^n))/2^n to the partial sum
4. Print partial sums as we compute them

```python
import math

def sign(x):
    if x > 0: return 1
    if x < 0: return -1
    return 0

def compute_partial_sums(max_n=30):
    total = 0.0
    for n in range(0, max_n + 1):
        term = sign(math.sin(2**n)) / (2**n)
        total += term
        print(f"Partial sum after n={n}: {total}")
    
    print("\nFinal partial sum:", total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_partial_sums()
```
