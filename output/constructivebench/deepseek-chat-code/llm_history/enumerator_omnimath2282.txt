[write_program]
This problem involves comparing power towers (iterated exponentials) of 2 and 3. We need to find the smallest natural number n where the power tower of 2 with height n exceeds the power tower of 3 with height 4. The Python program will compute these power towers and compare them to find the smallest such n.

```python
def power_tower(n, x):
    """Compute x^(x^(...^x)) with height n"""
    result = 1
    for _ in range(n):
        result = x ** result
    return result

def find_min_n():
    # Compute power tower of 3 with height 4 (3^(3^(3^3)))
    target = power_tower(4, 3)
    print(f"Power tower of 3 with height 4: {target}")
    
    n = 1
    while True:
        pt = power_tower(n, 2)
        print(f"n={n}: 2^...^2 = {pt}")
        if pt > target:
            print(f"Found minimal n where 2^...^2 > 3^3^3^3: n={n}")
            return n
        n += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_n()
```
