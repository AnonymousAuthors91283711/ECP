[write_program]
This problem asks to find all real numbers α such that for every positive integer n, the sum of floor((i+1)*α) for i from 0 to n-1 is divisible by n. We'll write a program to search for possible α values by testing small n values and looking for patterns.

The approach:
1. Test rational numbers of small denominator
2. For each candidate α, verify the divisibility condition for n up to a threshold
3. Output candidates that satisfy all tested conditions

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def test_alpha(alpha, max_n=10):
    """Test if alpha satisfies the condition for n from 1 to max_n"""
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        total = sum(math.floor((i + 1) * alpha) for i in range(n))
        if total % n != 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_candidates(max_denominator=5, max_n=10):
    """Search for rational candidates with small denominators"""
    print("Searching for α candidates...")
    for denom in range(1, max_denominator + 1):
        for numer in range(0, 2 * denom + 1):
            alpha = Fraction(numer, denom)
            if test_alpha(float(alpha), max_n):
                print(f"Found candidate: {alpha} = {float(alpha)}")
            # Also test alpha + 1/2 case which might work for odd denominators
            if denom % 2 == 1:
                alpha_half = alpha + Fraction(1, 2)
                if test_alpha(float(alpha_half), max_n):
                    print(f"Found candidate: {alpha_half} = {float(alpha_half)}")

    # Check irrational candidates like golden ratio
    irrationals = [ (1 + math.sqrt(5))/2, math.sqrt(2), math.pi ]
    for val in irrationals:
        if test_alpha(val, max_n):
            print(f"Found irrational candidate: {val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_candidates(max_denominator=5, max_n=10)
    print("Note: The pattern suggests α may be integers or half-integers")
```
