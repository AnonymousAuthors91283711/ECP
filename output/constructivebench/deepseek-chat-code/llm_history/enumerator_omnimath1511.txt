[write_program]
This problem involves finding the minimal sum `a + b + c` where `a, b, c` are distinct positive integers and there exists a real number `k` such that `k = sqrt(a * sqrt(b * sqrt(c)))`. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible triples `(a, b, c)` and find the minimal sum satisfying the condition.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible sums `s` starting from the smallest possible (6, since 1+2+3=6)
2. For each sum, generate all triples `(a, b, c)` with `a + b + c = s` and distinct values
3. Check if the condition `k = sqrt(a * sqrt(b * sqrt(c)))` holds for some integer `k`
4. Stop when we find the first valid triple (which will have the minimal sum)

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    root = math.isqrt(n)
    return root * root == n

def check_condition(a, b, c):
    # Compute sqrt(c)
    sqrt_c = math.sqrt(c)
    # Compute b * sqrt(c)
    b_sqrt_c = b * sqrt_c
    # Compute sqrt(b * sqrt(c))
    sqrt_b_sqrt_c = math.sqrt(b_sqrt_c)
    # Compute a * sqrt(b * sqrt(c))
    a_sqrt_b_sqrt_c = a * sqrt_b_sqrt_c
    # Compute k = sqrt(a * sqrt(b * sqrt(c)))
    k = math.sqrt(a_sqrt_b_sqrt_c)
    # Check if k is integer
    return k.is_integer()

def find_minimal_sum():
    s = 6  # minimal possible sum for distinct positive integers
    while True:
        # Generate all triples (a,b,c) with a+b+c = s and a,b,c distinct
        for a in range(1, s-1):
            for b in range(1, s-a):
                c = s - a - b
                if c <= 0:
                    continue
                if a == b or a == c or b == c:
                    continue
                if check_condition(a, b, c):
                    print(f"Found triple: ({a}, {b}, {c}) with sum {s}")
                    return s
        s += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    minimal_sum = find_minimal_sum()
    print(f"Minimal sum found: {minimal_sum}")
```
