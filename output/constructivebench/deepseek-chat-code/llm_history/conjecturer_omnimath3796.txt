3. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
From the problem and enumeration, we're looking for primes p where the cubic x³-3x+1 has exactly one root in ZMod p. This occurs when the polynomial has a double root and a single distinct root. The discriminant condition for this is when p divides the discriminant of x³-3x+1, which is 81. The prime factors of 81 are just 3.
