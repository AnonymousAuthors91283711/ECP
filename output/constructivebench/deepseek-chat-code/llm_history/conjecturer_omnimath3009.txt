  (h₁ : (a + b + c) / 3 = (32 : ℚ))
  (h₂ : (a + b + d) / 3 = (39 : ℚ)) 
  (h₃ : (a + c + d) / 3 = (40 : ℚ))

  max (max a b) (max c d) = omnimath3009_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solving the system of equations:
(1) a + b + c = 96
(2) a + b + d = 117
(3) a + c + d = 120
(4) b + c + d = 132

Subtracting equation (1) from others:
From (2)-(1): d - c = 21
From (3)-(1): d - b = 24
From (4)-(1): d - a = 36

Expressing variables in terms of d:
a = d - 36
b = d - 24
c = d - 21

Substituting into equation (1):
(d-36) + (d-24) + (d-21) = 96
3d - 81 = 96 => d = 59

Calculated d = 59
Calculated a = 23
Calculated b = 35
Calculated c = 38

Maximum value: 59. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
