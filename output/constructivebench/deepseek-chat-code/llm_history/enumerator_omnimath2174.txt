[write_program]
This problem appears to be about calculating the probability that a randomly selected element from Fin n (integers modulo n) satisfies x + 1 ≡ n (mod n). We'll write a Python program to enumerate this probability for small values of n to help understand the pattern.

The key observations:
1. Fin n represents numbers {0, 1, ..., n-1}
2. The condition x + 1 ≡ n (mod n) simplifies to x ≡ n-1 (mod n)
3. There's exactly one solution in Fin n: x = n-1
4. The probability is therefore 1/n

Here's the program to verify this pattern:

```python
def calculate_probability(n):
    """Calculate the probability that x+1 ≡ n mod n for x in Fin n"""
    if n == 0:
        return None  # undefined for n=0 as per problem statement
    solutions = [x for x in range(n) if (x + 1) % n == n % n]
    probability = len(solutions) / n
    return probability

# Test for small values of n
for n in range(1, 11):
    prob = calculate_probability(n)
    print(f"n={n}: probability = {prob}")
```

The program outputs the probability for n from 1 to 10, showing the pattern of 1/n. The output confirms that for each n, there's exactly one solution (x = n-1) making the probability 1/n.
