[write_program]
The problem asks to count the number of triples (k, m, n) where k, m, n ≤ 100 and satisfy the equation 2^m * n - 2^n * m = 2^k. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all valid triples within these bounds.

The approach:
1. Iterate through all possible m and n from 0 to 100
2. For each (m, n) pair, compute 2^m * n - 2^n * m
3. Check if the result is a power of 2 (2^k)
4. If yes, determine k and verify k ≤ 100
5. Count all valid triples

```python
def count_triples():
    count = 0
    max_val = 100
    # Precompute powers of 2 up to maximum possible value in equation
    max_power = 2**(max_val) * max_val
    powers_of_2 = set()
    p = 1
    while p <= max_power:
        powers_of_2.add(p)
        p *= 2
    
    for m in range(max_val + 1):
        pow2_m = 2 ** m
        for n in range(max_val + 1):
            if m == n:
                # Equation becomes 0 = 2^k which only works when k=0
                count += 1
                print(f"Found triple: k=0, m={m}, n={n}")
                continue
            val = pow2_m * n - (2 ** n) * m
            if val in powers_of_2:
                k = 0
                while val % 2 == 0 and val > 0:
                    val //= 2
                    k += 1
                if val == 1 and k <= max_val:
                    count += 1
                    print(f"Found triple: k={k}, m={m}, n={n}")
    
    print(f"Total number of valid triples: {count}")

count_triples()
```
