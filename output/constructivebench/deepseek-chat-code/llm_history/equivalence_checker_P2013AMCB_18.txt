Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 
    if n % 6 = 1 ∨ n % 6 = 3 ∨ n % 6 = 5 then "Jenna"
    else "First player"
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n % 2 = 1 then "Jenna" else "First player"
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer checks if n modulo 6 is 1, 3, or 5 to determine the winner. The proposed answer checks if n is odd (n % 2 = 1).

For n=2013:
- 2013 % 6 = 3 (so Jenna wins in ground truth)
- 2013 is odd (so Jenna wins in proposed)

For n=2014:
- 2014 % 6 = 4 (so First player wins in ground truth)
- 2014 is even (so First player wins in proposed)

However, the equivalence doesn't hold for all numbers. For example:
- n=5: 5%6=5 (Jenna) vs 5%2=1 (Jenna) - same
- n=7: 7%6=1 (Jenna) vs 7%2=1 (Jenna) - same
- n=9: 9%6=3 (Jenna) vs 9%2=1 (Jenna) - same
- n=2: 2%6=2 (First) vs 2%2=0 (First) - same
- n=4: 4%6=4 (First) vs 4%2=0 (First) - same
- n=6: 6%6=0 (First) vs 6%2=0 (First) - same

But the problem specifies that n is either 2013 or 2014, and for these specific values, both answers agree. Therefore, within the problem's constraints (n = 2013 ∨ n = 2014), the answers are equivalent.
