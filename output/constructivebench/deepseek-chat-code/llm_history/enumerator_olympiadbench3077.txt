The problem asks to compute the floor of 100,000 multiplied by 1.002 raised to the 10th power. We'll calculate this exactly in Python by using exact arithmetic with fractions to avoid floating-point inaccuracies.

The approach:
1. Represent 1.002 as the fraction 1002/1000
2. Raise this fraction to the 10th power using exact arithmetic
3. Multiply by 100,000
4. Take the floor of the result

We'll use Python's fractions module for exact arithmetic and compare with floating-point computation to verify.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def exact_calculation():
    # Exact calculation using fractions
    base = Fraction(1002, 1000)
    exponent = 10
    power = base ** exponent
    result = 100000 * power
    return result.numerator // result.denominator

def floating_point_calculation():
    # Floating point calculation for comparison
    return int(100000 * (1.002 ** 10))

exact = exact_calculation()
approx = floating_point_calculation()

print(f"Exact calculation result: {exact}")
print(f"Floating point result: {approx}")

# Output the final answer
print(f"\nFinal answer: {exact}")
```
