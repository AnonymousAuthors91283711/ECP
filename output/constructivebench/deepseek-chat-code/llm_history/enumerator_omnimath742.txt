[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number `n` such that `sqrt(n + 99) - sqrt(n) < 1`. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal `n` by testing successive values until the condition is satisfied.

The approach:
1. For each `n` starting from 0, compute `sqrt(n + 99) - sqrt(n)`
2. Check if the difference is less than 1
3. The first `n` that satisfies this condition is the answer

```python
import math

def find_min_n():
    n = 0
    while True:
        diff = math.sqrt(n + 99) - math.sqrt(n)
        if diff < 1:
            print(f"Found candidate: {n}")
            print(f"Verification: sqrt({n}+99) - sqrt({n}) = {diff} < 1")
            print(f"Minimal n satisfying the condition: {n}")
            return
        n += 1

find_min_n()
```
