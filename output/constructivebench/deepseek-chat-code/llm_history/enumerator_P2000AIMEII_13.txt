[write_program]
This problem involves finding real roots of a 6th-degree polynomial and expressing them in a specific form. We'll write a Python program to:
1. Find approximate roots of the polynomial
2. Check if they can be expressed in the form (m + sqrt(n))/r
3. Enumerate possible integer values for m, n, r that satisfy the conditions

```python
import numpy as np
from sympy import symbols, Poly, real_roots
from math import gcd, isqrt

def find_roots():
    # Define the polynomial: 2000x^6 + 100x^5 + 10x^3 + x - 2
    x = symbols('x')
    p = Poly(2000*x**6 + 100*x**5 + 10*x**3 + x - 2, x)
    
    # Get real roots
    roots = real_roots(p)
    return [float(r.evalf()) for r in roots]

def is_perfect_square(n):
    return isqrt(n) ** 2 == n

def find_expression(x, max_r=100):
    # Try to express x as (m + sqrt(n))/r
    for r in range(1, max_r + 1):
        rx = x * r
        m = round(rx)
        residual = rx - m
        
        if abs(residual) < 1e-6:  # Integer case (n=0)
            n = 0
            if gcd(m, r) == 1:
                return m, n, r
        else:
            # Try to find n such that residual â‰ˆ sqrt(n)/r
            possible_n = round((residual * r) ** 2)
            # Check if it's a perfect square and gives exact expression
            if is_perfect_square(possible_n):
                sqrt_n = isqrt(possible_n)
                reconstructed = (m + sqrt_n) / r
                if abs(reconstructed - x) < 1e-8 and gcd(m, r) == 1:
                    return m, possible_n, r
    return None

def main():
    roots = find_roots()
    print("Found roots:", roots)
    
    for x in roots:
        expr = find_expression(x)
        if expr:
            m, n, r = expr
            print(f"Root {x:.6f} can be expressed as ({m} + sqrt({n}))/{r}")
            print(f"m + n + r = {m + n + r}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
