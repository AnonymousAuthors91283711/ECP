Ground Truth Answer: 27/64
Proposed Answer: 3/4
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the expected number of pairs of consecutive heads when flipping 3 fair coins (p=1/2). 

2. The ground truth answer is 27/64 ≈ 0.4219.

3. The proposed answer is 3/4 = 0.75.

4. Let's verify the correct calculation:
- For 3 coins, there are 2 possible consecutive pairs (positions 1-2 and 2-3).
- The probability of any specific pair being HH is (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4.
- However, the pairs are not independent, so we can't simply multiply by 2.
- The exact calculation should consider all cases where at least one HH pair occurs, weighted by how many HH pairs occur in each case.

5. The proposed answer 3/4 is too large - it's actually the probability of getting at least one head in 3 flips, not the expected number of consecutive HH pairs.
