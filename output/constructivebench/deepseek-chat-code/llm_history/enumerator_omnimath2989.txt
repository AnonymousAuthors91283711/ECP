[write_program]
This appears to be a simple arithmetic problem where we need to compute 2^3 - 2 + 3. The answer can be computed directly without enumeration. However, since the problem asks for a Python program to enumerate possible answers (though unnecessary in this case), I'll provide a program that computes this simple expression.

```python
# Simple computation of 2^3 - 2 + 3
result = 2**3 - 2 + 3
print(result)
```

The program outputs 9, which is the correct answer to the expression 2^3 - 2 + 3 (8 - 2 + 3 = 9). No enumeration is needed for this straightforward calculation.
