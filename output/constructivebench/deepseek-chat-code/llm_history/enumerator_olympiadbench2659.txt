This problem involves simplifying a nested exponent expression. We'll write a Python program to compute the exact value by breaking down the exponents step by step. The key is to simplify the exponents using exponent rules before doing any computation.

```python
import math

def main():
    # Break down the exponents step by step
    exponent = 9**2 - 9  # 81 - 9 = 72
    base = 10**exponent  # 10^72
    
    # Now handle the nested exponents from right to left
    # (1/2)^(1/2) = sqrt(1/2) = 1/sqrt(2)
    # (1/9)^(1/sqrt(2)) = 9^(-1/sqrt(2))
    # Then raise base to this power: (10^72)^(9^(-1/sqrt(2)))
    
    # This simplifies to 10^(72 * 9^(-1/sqrt(2)))
    # We can compute this exactly using exponent rules
    inner_exponent = 72 * (9 ** (-1/math.sqrt(2)))
    result = 10 ** inner_exponent
    
    # Print the exact form and numerical approximation
    print("Simplified form: 10^(72 * 9^(-1/âˆš2))")
    print(f"Numerical approximation: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
