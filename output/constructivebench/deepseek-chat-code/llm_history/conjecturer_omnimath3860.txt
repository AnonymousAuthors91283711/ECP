Minimal a[6] for n=7: 720. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated answers, we can observe a clear pattern:
- For n=3 (index 2), the minimal ending value is 2 = 2!
- For n=4 (index 3), it's 6 = 3!
- For n=5 (index 4), it's 24 = 4!
- And so on...

The pattern suggests that for a sequence of length n, the minimal value at the last position (index n-1) is (n-1)!. 

The error in the original proposed answer comes from trying to make the definition a function when it should be a constant value (since the problem is specifically for n=2020). We should fix this by directly providing the factorial value for n=2020.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<2019!>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem asks for the minimal value at position 2019 (since Fin 2020 has indices 0-2019)
2. From the pattern in enumerated answers, we see the minimal value at index k is (k+1)!
3. Therefore, for index 2019, the minimal value should be 2020! - but looking closer at the pattern:
   - For n=3 (index 2), value is 2! = 2
   - For n=4 (index 3), value is 3! = 6
   - So for index k, value is (k)!
4. Thus for index 2019, the minimal value is 2019!
