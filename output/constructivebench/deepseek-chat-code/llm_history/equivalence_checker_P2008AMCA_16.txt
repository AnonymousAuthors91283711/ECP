Ground Truth Answer: 112
Proposed Answer: 73
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding a pattern in logarithmic terms and deriving a sequence where the 12th term equals log(b^n) for some n (the answer we're seeking).

2. From the given terms:
   - term1 = log(a³b⁷)
   - term2 = log(a⁵b¹²)
   - term3 = log(a⁸b¹⁵)

3. The condition term2 - term1 = term3 - term2 implies this is an arithmetic sequence.

4. Calculating the common difference d:
   d = term2 - term1 = log(a⁵b¹²) - log(a³b⁷) = log(a²b⁵)

5. The general term of the sequence is:
   seq k = term1 + (k-1)*d = log(a³b⁷) + (k-1)*log(a²b⁵) = log(a^(3+2(k-1))b^(7+5(k-1)))

6. For k=12:
   seq 12 = log(a^(3+22)b^(7+55)) = log(a^25b^62)

7. But the problem states seq 12 = log(b^n), so we must have a^25 = 1 ⇒ a = 1 (since a > 0), making the expression log(b^62).

8. Therefore, the correct exponent n should be 62, not 112 or 73.

The ground truth answer (112) and proposed answer (73) are both incorrect. However, since the question asks to compare the two given answers:

<<<False>>>
