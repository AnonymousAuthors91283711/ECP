[write_program]
This problem asks to find the real number x â‰¥ 2 that satisfies the given equation involving square roots. We'll write a Python program to numerically approximate the solution by testing values in a reasonable range.

The approach will be:
1. Define the equation as a function
2. Test values of x in [2, 10] with small increments
3. Print x values where the equation is approximately satisfied
4. The solution appears to be around 3, so we'll focus more precision there

```python
import math

def equation(x):
    term1 = 1 / (math.sqrt(x) + math.sqrt(x - 2))
    term2 = 1 / (math.sqrt(x + 2) + math.sqrt(x))
    return term1 + term2 - 0.25

# First pass: coarse search
print("Coarse search results:")
for x in [2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0]:
    val = equation(x)
    print(f"x={x}: {val:.6f}")

# Second pass: fine search around promising value
print("\nFine search around x=3:")
for i in range(20):
    x = 2.9 + i * 0.01
    val = equation(x)
    if abs(val) < 0.01:  # Print if close to solution
        print(f"x={x:.4f}: {val:.6f}")

# Final verification at x=3
print("\nVerification at x=3:")
print(f"x=3: {equation(3):.10f}")
```
