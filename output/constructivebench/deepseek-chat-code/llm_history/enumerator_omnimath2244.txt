[write_program]
This problem asks for all positive integer triples (x,y,z) that satisfy both equations:
1. x² + y - z = 100
2. x + y² - z = 124

We can solve this by:
1. Subtracting the equations to eliminate z
2. Enumerating possible integer solutions for x and y
3. Calculating z for each valid (x,y) pair

The Python program will:
1. Iterate through possible x and y values (up to reasonable bounds)
2. Check if they satisfy the derived equation from subtraction
3. Calculate z and verify all conditions
4. Print valid triples as they're found

```python
def find_triples():
    # Iterate x from 1 to 20 (since x^2 appears and 20^2=400 is reasonable)
    for x in range(1, 21):
        # Iterate y from 1 to 20 (since y^2 appears)
        for y in range(1, 21):
            # Check the equation obtained by subtracting the two original equations
            if x**2 - x + y - y**2 == -24:
                # Calculate z from first equation
                z = x**2 + y - 100
                # Verify all conditions
                if z > 0 and (x + y**2 - z) == 124:
                    print(f"({x}, {y}, {z})")

find_triples()
