Ground Truth Answer: 2 * (X + C 4) * (X - C 4) * (X - C 8)
Proposed Answer: C 210 + X * (C 42 + X * C 21)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a polynomial p(x) that satisfies two conditions:
   - A functional equation involving p evaluated at different points
   - A specific value at x=1 (p(1)=210)

2. The ground truth answer is a factored cubic polynomial: 2*(x+4)*(x-4)*(x-8)

3. The proposed answer is a quadratic polynomial in expanded form: 210 + 42x + 21x²

Let's check if they're equivalent:

- The ground truth polynomial evaluated at x=1:
  2*(1+4)*(1-4)*(1-8) = 2*5*(-3)*(-7) = 210 (matches the condition)

- The proposed polynomial at x=1:
  210 + 42*1 + 21*1 = 273 (does not match the condition)

Even without checking the functional equation, we can see the proposed answer fails the second condition (p(1)=210). The proposed answer is a quadratic while the correct answer should be cubic.
