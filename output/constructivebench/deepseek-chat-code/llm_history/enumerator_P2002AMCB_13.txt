[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer `s` that can be expressed as both:
1. The sum of 18 consecutive positive integers (i.e., `k + (k+1) + ... + (k+17)` for some `k > 0`)
2. A perfect square (`s = mÂ²` for some `m`)

We'll write a Python program to find this minimal `s` by:
1. Expressing the sum of 18 consecutive integers as `18k + 153` (since the sum is 18k + (0+1+...+17))
2. Checking when this sum equals a perfect square
3. Finding the smallest such `s` where `k > 0`

```python
import math

def find_min_s():
    min_s = None
    # The sum is 18k + 153, must be perfect square
    # We'll search m where m^2 >= 153 + 18*1 = 171
    start_m = math.isqrt(171) + 1
    for m in range(start_m, 1000):  # 1000 is arbitrary upper bound
        s = m * m
        k = (s - 153) / 18
        if k == int(k) and k > 0:
            k_int = int(k)
            print(f"Found: s={s} (m={m}), with k={k_int}")
            if min_s is None or s < min_s:
                min_s = s
    if min_s is not None:
        print(f"Minimal s is: {min_s}")

find_min_s()
```
