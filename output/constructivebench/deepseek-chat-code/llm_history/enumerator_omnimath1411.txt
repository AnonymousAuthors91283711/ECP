The problem asks for the greatest natural number `n` such that `(2004)!` divides `((n!)!)!`. To find this, we need to understand the relationship between factorials and divisibility. The key insight is that `((n!)!)!` must contain all the prime factors of `(2004)!` with sufficient multiplicity.

We can approach this by finding the largest `n` such that `n!!` is greater than or equal to `2004`, since `((n!)!)!` will then include `(2004)!` as a factor. The double factorial `n!!` grows very rapidly, so we can efficiently enumerate possible `n` values.

Here's a Python program to find the largest `n` where `factorial(factorial(n))` is divisible by `factorial(2004)`:

```python
import math

def find_max_n():
    target = 2004
    max_n = 0
    # We'll check n up to 100, which is more than enough
    for n in range(1, 100):
        try:
            # Compute factorial(n) and then its factorial
            fn = math.factorial(n)
            fn_fact = math.factorial(fn)
            # Check if (2004)! divides ((n!)!)!
            if fn_fact % math.factorial(target) == 0:
                print(f"Found valid n: {n}")
                max_n = n
        except OverflowError:
            # For large n, factorial computation may overflow
            # But we can stop earlier since factorial grows rapidly
            break
    print(f"The greatest n is: {max_n}")

find_max_n()
```

The program checks each `n` from 1 upwards, computes `((n!)!)!`, and verifies divisibility by `(2004)!`. It stops when `n` becomes too large for factorial computation (which will happen quickly due to rapid growth). The largest valid `n` found is printed as the final result.
