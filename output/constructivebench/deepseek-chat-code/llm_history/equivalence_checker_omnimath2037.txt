Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (1 / 6)^n
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (4^n - 3^n) / (3^n * 4^n)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the value of a linear functional f evaluated at the constant function 5, given its behavior on functions with values 3 or 4.

2. The ground truth answer is (1/6)^n, which simplifies to 1/(6^n).

3. The proposed answer is (4^n - 3^n)/(3^n * 4^n), which can be rewritten as (4^n)/(3^n * 4^n) - (3^n)/(3^n * 4^n) = 1/3^n - 1/4^n.

Now let's compare:
- For n=1: 
  Ground truth: 1/6 ≈ 0.1667
  Proposed: 1/3 - 1/4 = 1/12 ≈ 0.0833
  These are different.

- For n=2:
  Ground truth: 1/36 ≈ 0.0278
  Proposed: 1/9 - 1/16 ≈ 0.0486
  Still different.

The answers are clearly not equivalent for any n ≥ 1. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth.
