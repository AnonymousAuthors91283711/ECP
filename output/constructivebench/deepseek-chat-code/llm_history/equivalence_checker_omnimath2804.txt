Ground Truth Answer: 20
Proposed Answer: 0
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting the number of sequences f: Fin 11 → ℝ satisfying:
   - Boundary conditions: f(0) = 4, f(10) = 1024
   - Recurrence relation: f(n) + f(n-1) = (5/2)√(f(n)f(n-1)) for n ∈ {1,...,10}

2. The recurrence relation can be transformed into a simpler form by substitution. Let's define g(n) = √f(n). Then the recurrence becomes:
   g(n)² + g(n-1)² = (5/2)g(n)g(n-1)
   This is a quadratic recurrence relation.

3. Solving this recurrence, we find that the sequences must satisfy g(n) = 2g(n-1) or g(n) = g(n-1)/2 at each step. 

4. Given the boundary conditions g(0) = 2 (since √4 = 2) and g(10) = 32 (since √1024 = 32), there's exactly one valid sequence that satisfies these conditions by always doubling at each step.

5. Therefore, there's exactly 1 valid sequence, and 1 mod 100 is 1 (not 20 or 0).

However, the ground truth answer is given as 20 and the proposed answer is 0. Both appear incorrect based on this analysis. But since the problem asks to compare the proposed answer (0) with the ground truth (20), they are clearly different.
