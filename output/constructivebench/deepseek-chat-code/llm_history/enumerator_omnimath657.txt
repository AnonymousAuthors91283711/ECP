This problem involves finding a unique 6-tuple of positive integers (n₁, n₂, n₃, n₄, n₅, n₆) that satisfies both a complex Fibonacci sum identity and a sum constraint. We'll approach this by:

1. Calculating the left-hand side (LHS) sum of Fibonacci numbers
2. Enumerating possible combinations of n₁-n₆ that could match this value
3. Checking the sum condition n₁+n₂+...+n₆

Since the exact computation of the LHS is computationally intensive, we'll use a simplified approach with smaller parameters and Fibonacci identities to find patterns.

```python
def fib(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a

# Smaller test case to find pattern
max_i = 5  # Reduced from 101 for demonstration
lhs = 0
for i1 in range(max_i):
    for i2 in range(max_i):
        for i3 in range(max_i):
            for i4 in range(max_i):
                for i5 in range(max_i):
                    lhs += fib(i1 + i2 + i3 + i4 + i5)

print(f"LHS sum for max_i={max_i}: {lhs}")

# Search for n values that could satisfy the pattern
max_n = 30  # Reasonable upper bound for demonstration
found = False
for n1 in range(1, max_n):
    for n2 in range(1, max_n):
        for n3 in range(1, max_n):
            for n4 in range(1, max_n):
                for n5 in range(1, max_n):
                    for n6 in range(1, max_n):
                        rhs = fib(n1) - 5*fib(n2) + 10*fib(n3) - 10*fib(n4) + 5*fib(n5) - fib(n6)
                        if rhs == lhs:
                            total = n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5 + n6
                            print(f"Found candidate: ({n1},{n2},{n3},{n4},{n5},{n6}) with sum {total}")
                            found = True
if not found:
    print("No candidates found in search space")
```
