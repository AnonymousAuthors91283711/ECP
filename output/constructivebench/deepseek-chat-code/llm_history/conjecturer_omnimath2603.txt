abbrev omnimath2603_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2603 :
  let n := 10
  let k := 5
  let m := 4
  let Ω := {f : Fin m → Finset (Fin n) | ∀ i, (f i).card = k ∧ ∀ x, x ∈ f i → (x + 1) % n ∈ f i}
  let A := {f ∈ Ω | ∃ x : Fin n, ∀ i, x ∉ f i}
  10000 * (Nat.card A / Nat.card Ω : ℚ) = omnimath2603_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Computed value: 3680.0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the problem, we're dealing with circular constraints on sets and counting configurations where a common element is excluded. The enumerated answer 3680 suggests a pattern of 368 * 10, where 10 is n. The numerator likely involves inclusion-exclusion principles for circular arrangements.
