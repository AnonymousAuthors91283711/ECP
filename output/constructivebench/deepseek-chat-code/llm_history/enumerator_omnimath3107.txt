This problem is a simple linear equation where we need to solve for x and then compute 2x. The equation is 4x + 14 = 8x - 48. We'll solve it step by step and output the value of 2x.

The solution approach:
1. Start with the equation 4x + 14 = 8x - 48
2. Subtract 4x from both sides: 14 = 4x - 48
3. Add 48 to both sides: 62 = 4x
4. Divide both sides by 4: x = 15.5
5. Multiply by 2: 2x = 31

Since this is a straightforward algebraic problem, we'll just output the final answer directly.

```python
# Solving the equation 4x + 14 = 8x - 48 for x
# Then computing 2x as the final answer
print(31)
```
