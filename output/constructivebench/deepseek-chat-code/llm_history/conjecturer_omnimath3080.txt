Total count: 4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<1500 * 7>>> 

Explanation: The enumerated answers are all multiples of 1500 (10500=1500×7, 13500=1500×9, etc.). The problem involves divisors of 2n and 5n with specific counts (64 and 60). The pattern suggests n must be 1500 times an odd number coprime to 2 and 5. The general solution appears to be 1500 multiplied by numbers from a specific set (here 7,9,11,13).
