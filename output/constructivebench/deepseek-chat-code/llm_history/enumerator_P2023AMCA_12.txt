[write_program]
This problem involves calculating a sum of cubes with alternating signs based on whether the index is even or odd. We'll write a Python program to compute this sum exactly for the given range (1 to 18).

The approach:
1. Iterate through numbers 1 to 18
2. For each number, cube it and multiply by -1 if odd, keep positive if even
3. Accumulate the sum
4. Print the final result

```python
def compute_sum():
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, 19):
        term = i ** 3
        if i % 2 != 0:  # if odd
            term *= -1
        total += term
    print(total)

compute_sum()
```
