This problem involves finding real numbers b and c such that the equation x^6 + 1/x^6 = T(x)^3 + b*T(x) + c holds for all non-zero real x, where T(x) = x^2 + 1/x^2. We'll approach this by:

1. Expressing everything in terms of y = x^2 + 1/x^2
2. Using algebraic identities to find the relationship
3. Enumerating possible (b,c) pairs that satisfy the equation

The key identities we'll use are:
- x^2 + 1/x^2 = y
- x^4 + 1/x^4 = y^2 - 2
- x^6 + 1/x^6 = y^3 - 3y

```python
def main():
    # We'll test the equation for specific non-zero x values to find b and c
    test_values = [1, 2, 0.5, 3]  # Sample non-zero x values
    
    # We know from algebra that x^6 + 1/x^6 = (x^2 + 1/x^2)^3 - 3(x^2 + 1/x^2)
    # So T(x)^3 - 3T(x) = x^6 + 1/x^6
    # Comparing with given equation: T(x)^3 + b*T(x) + c = T(x)^3 - 3T(x)
    # Therefore b = -3 and c = 0
    
    # Verification
    for x in test_values:
        if x == 0:
            continue
        T = x**2 + 1/x**2
        lhs = x**6 + 1/x**6
        rhs = T**3 - 3*T
        print(f"For x={x}: LHS={lhs}, RHS={rhs}, Match={abs(lhs-rhs)<1e-9}")
    
    # The solution is:
    print("\nThe required pair is (b, c) = (-3, 0)")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
