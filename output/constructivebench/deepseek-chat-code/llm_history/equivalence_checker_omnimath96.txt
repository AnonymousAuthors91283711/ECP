Ground Truth Answer: {0, id}
Proposed Answer: {fun _ => 0, fun x => x}
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The proposed answer {fun _ => 0, fun x => x} is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer {0, id}, just written in different notation. In Lean/functional programming:
- fun _ => 0 is the constant zero function (equivalent to 0)
- fun x => x is the identity function (equivalent to id)
Both answers correctly identify the only two functions that satisfy the given functional equation.
