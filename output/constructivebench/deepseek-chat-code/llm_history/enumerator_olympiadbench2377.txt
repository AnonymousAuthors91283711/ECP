This problem involves calculating the expected number of pairs of consecutive heads when flipping 3 fair coins. We'll enumerate all possible outcomes of 3 coin flips, count the number of consecutive head pairs in each outcome, and compute the expected value by summing over all outcomes weighted by their probabilities.

```python
from itertools import product
from fractions import Fraction

def count_consecutive_heads(outcome):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(outcome)-1):
        if outcome[i] == 'H' and outcome[i+1] == 'H':
            count += 1
    return count

def main():
    coins = 3
    p = Fraction(1, 2)
    total = Fraction(0, 1)
    
    for outcome in product(['H', 'T'], repeat=coins):
        prob = Fraction(1, 2**coins)
        ch = count_consecutive_heads(outcome)
        total += prob * ch
        print(f"Outcome: {''.join(outcome)}, Consecutive Heads: {ch}, Probability: {prob}")
    
    print(f"\nExpected number of consecutive heads: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
