[write_program]
The problem asks to find the number of odd integers n satisfying 17/4 < n < 35/2. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such integers and count them.

First, we convert the inequalities to decimal equivalents:
- 17/4 = 4.25
- 35/2 = 17.5

So we need to find all odd integers n where 4.25 < n < 17.5. This means n ranges from 5 to 17 inclusive. We'll check each odd number in this range.

```python
def count_odd_in_range():
    lower_bound = 17 / 4  # 4.25
    upper_bound = 35 / 2   # 17.5
    
    count = 0
    # The smallest integer > 4.25 is 5, largest integer < 17.5 is 17
    for n in range(5, 18):
        if n % 2 == 1:  # Check if odd
            print(f"Found valid odd integer: {n}")
            count += 1
    
    print(f"Total count of odd integers satisfying the condition: {count}")

count_odd_in_range()
```
