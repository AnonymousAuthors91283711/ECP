[write_program]
This problem asks for integer triples (a, b, c) such that the three expressions {(a+b)/2 + c, (a+c)/2 + b, (b+c)/2 + a} equal the set {13, 37, 42} in some order. Since we're working with integers, we need to ensure all divisions are exact (i.e., a+b, a+c, b+c must all be even).

We'll approach this by:
1. Enumerating possible permutations of the target values {13, 37, 42}
2. Solving the resulting system of equations for each permutation
3. Checking that solutions are integers and satisfy all conditions

```python
def solve():
    targets = [13, 37, 42]
    found = False
    
    # Iterate through all permutations of the target values
    from itertools import permutations
    for p in permutations(targets):
        x, y, z = p
        
        # Solve the system of equations:
        # (a+b)/2 + c = x
        # (a+c)/2 + b = y
        # (b+c)/2 + a = z
        
        # Rewrite equations to eliminate fractions (assuming a+b, a+c, b+c are even)
        # 2x = a + b + 2c
        # 2y = a + 2b + c
        # 2z = 2a + b + c
        
        # Solve the linear system
        # We can represent this as a matrix equation M * [a,b,c] = [2x,2y,2z]
        # Where M is [[1,1,2], [1,2,1], [2,1,1]]
        
        # Using Cramer's rule to solve
        detM = 1*(2*1 - 1*1) - 1*(1*1 - 2*1) + 2*(1*1 - 2*2)
        detM = 1*(2-1) - 1*(1-2) + 2*(1-4)
        detM = 1 - (-1) + (-6) = -4
        
        if detM == 0:
            continue
            
        # Calculate determinants for a, b, c
        detA = 2*x*(2*1 - 1*1) - 1*(2*y*1 - 2*z*1) + 2*(2*y*1 - 2*z*2)
        detA = 2*x*(2-1) - (2*y - 2*z) + 2*(2*y - 4*z)
        detA = 2*x - 2*y + 2*z + 4*y - 8*z
        detA = 2*x + 2*y - 6*z
        
        detB = 1*(2*y*1 - 2*z*1) - 2*x*(1*1 - 2*1) + 2*(1*2*z - 2*2*y)
        detB = (2*y - 2*z) - 2*x*(-1) + 2*(2*z - 4*y)
        detB = 2*y - 2*z + 2*x + 4*z - 8*y
        detB = 2*x - 6*y + 2*z
        
        detC = 1*(2*2*z - 1*2*y) - 1*(1*2*z - 2*2*y) + 2*x*(1*1 - 2*2)
        detC = (4*z - 2*y) - (2*z - 4*y) + 2*x*(1-4)
        detC = 4*z - 2*y - 2*z + 4*y - 6*x
        detC = 2*z + 2*y - 6*x
        
        a = detA // detM
        b = detB // detM
        c = detC // detM
        
        # Verify the solution
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0 and (a + c) % 2 == 0 and (b + c) % 2 == 0:
            val1 = (a + b) // 2 + c
            val2 = (a + c) // 2 + b
            val3 = (b + c) // 2 + a
            if {val1, val2, val3} == {13, 37, 42}:
                print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
                found = True
    
    if not found:
        print("No solutions found")

Judgement:
The problem requires finding all integer triples (a, b, c) such that the three expressions {(a+b)/2 + c, (a+c)/2 + b, (b+c)/2 + a} equal the set {13, 37, 42} in some permutation. The original program attempts to solve this by checking all permutations of the target values and solving the resulting linear system, but it fails to find any solutions due to incorrect handling of integer division and verification.

Key issues:
1. The program doesn't properly handle cases where (a+b), (a+c), (b+c) must be even for the divisions to work
2. The verification step is too strict - it checks exact equality with the target set when it should allow any permutation
3. The program doesn't output any solutions despite valid ones existing

The program should be rejected as it fails to find the correct solutions.

```python
def solve():
    targets = {13, 37, 42}
    
    # We'll generate possible (x,y,z) permutations implicitly by checking all combinations
    # The equations are:
    # (a+b)/2 + c = x
    # (a+c)/2 + b = y
    # (b+c)/2 + a = z
    
    # Rewritten as:
    # a + b + 2c = 2x
    # a + 2b + c = 2y
    # 2a + b + c = 2z
    
    # Solve for a, b, c:
    # a = (4z - 2x - 2y)/3
    # b = (4y - 2x - 2z)/3
    # c = (4x - 2y - 2z)/3
    
    # We need all these to be integers and (a+b), (a+c), (b+c) to be even

        for y in targets:
            if y == x:
                continue

Explanation:
The problem involves finding all integer triples (a, b, c) such that the set {(a+b)/2 + c, (a+c)/2 + b, (b+c)/2 + a} equals {13, 37, 42}. The original submission is empty (no program provided), so it cannot be accepted.

We need to write a Python program that:
1. Enumerates possible integer triples (a, b, c)
2. Checks if they satisfy the given condition
3. Outputs valid triples as they are found
4. Ensures the solution is efficient by limiting the search space

The solution should consider that all expressions must evaluate to integers (since we're working with ℤ), which implies certain parity conditions on a, b, c.

<<<False>>>

```python
# Find all integer triples (a,b,c) where {(a+b)/2 + c, (a+c)/2 + b, (b+c)/2 + a} = {13, 37, 42}
# Since results must be integers, a+b, a+c, b+c must all be even (same parity)
# We'll search a reasonable range around the target values

def solve():
    target = {13, 37, 42}
    # Since the expressions are symmetric, we can assume a <= b <= c without loss of generality
    # The values are centered around the targets, so search ±100 is sufficient
    for a in range(-100, 101):
        for b in range(a, 101):
            # a and b must have same parity to make (a+b)/2 integer
            if (a + b) % 2 != 0:
                continue
            for c in range(b, 101):
                if (a + c) % 2 != 0 or (b + c) % 2 != 0:
                    continue
                s1 = (a + b) // 2 + c
                s2 = (a + c) // 2 + b
                s3 = (b + c) // 2 + a
                if {s1, s2, s3} == target:
                    print((a, b, c))
                    # Also print permutations since we assumed a<=b<=c
                    if a != b or b != c:
                        print((a, c
