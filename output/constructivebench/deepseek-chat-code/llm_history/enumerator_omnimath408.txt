This problem asks for the probability that two independent uniform random variables X and Y in [0,120] satisfy |X-Y| ≤ 15. We'll compute this by calculating the area where |X-Y| ≤ 15 within the [0,120]×[0,120] square and divide by the total area (120×120).

The region where |X-Y| ≤ 15 consists of all points between the lines Y = X+15 and Y = X-15, but clipped to the square. We can compute this area by subtracting the two triangular regions where |X-Y| > 15 from the total area.

```python
def compute_probability():
    total_area = 120 * 120
    # The two triangles where |x-y| > 15
    # Each has area (105*105)/2 (since 120-15=105)
    excluded_area = 105 * 105
    included_area = total_area - excluded_area
    probability = included_area / total_area
    print(f"Probability: {probability}")
