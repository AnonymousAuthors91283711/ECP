abbrev omnimath1636_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath1636 :
  (∑' a : Fin 7 → ℕ, (∑ i : Fin 7, a i) / 3 ^ (∑ i : Fin 7, a i) = omnimath1636_answer) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 15309 / 256
Proposed Answer: 189 + 7 / 9
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: 15309/256 ≈ 59.80078125
2. Proposed Answer: 189 + 7/9 = 1708/9 ≈ 189.777...

These are clearly different values. The proposed answer is significantly larger than the ground truth answer. 

The proposed answer appears to be incorrect as it doesn't match the ground truth value. There's no simplification or transformation that would make these two expressions equivalent.

<<<False>>>
