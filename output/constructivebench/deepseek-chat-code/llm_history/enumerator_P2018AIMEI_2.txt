This problem involves finding natural numbers a, b, c that satisfy three equations simultaneously, with constraints on their ranges. We'll enumerate all possible combinations of a, b, c within the given bounds and check which ones satisfy all equations.

```python
def solve():
    # Iterate through all possible values of a, b, c within given constraints
    for a in range(1, 6):  # 1 ≤ a ≤ 5
        for b in range(0, 14):  # b ≤ 13
            for c in range(0, 14):  # c ≤ 13
                # Calculate the common value n from the first equation
                n1 = a * 14**2 + b * 14 + c
                n2 = a * 15**2 + c * 15 + b
                if n1 != n2:
                    continue
                
                # Verify the third equation
                n3 = a * 6**3 + c * 6**2 + a * 6 + c
                if n1 == n3:
                    print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, n={n1}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
