This problem involves solving an exponential equation to find the real value(s) of x that satisfy the equation. We'll write a Python program to numerically search for solutions by evaluating both sides of the equation for different x values and checking when they are approximately equal.

The approach will be:
1. Define the left and right sides of the equation as functions
2. Search over a range of x values with small increments
3. Compare the difference between both sides
4. Output x values where the difference is below a small threshold

```python
import math

def left_side(x):
    return 3**(x + 2) + 2**(x + 2) + 2**x

def right_side(x):
    return 2**(x + 5) + 3**x

def find_solutions():
    threshold = 1e-6
    step = 0.001
    # Search in a reasonable range where exponentials are computable
    for x in range(-100, 100):
        x_val = x * 0.1
        diff = abs(left_side(x_val) - right_side(x_val))
        if diff < threshold:
            print(f"Possible solution found at x = {x_val:.3f} with difference {diff:.2e}")

    # Refine search around interesting regions
    print("\nRefined search around candidate solutions:")
    for candidate in [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]:  # Common integer candidates
        for offset in range(-100, 100):
            x_val = candidate + offset * 0.0001
            diff = abs(left_side(x_val) - right_side(x_val))
            if diff < threshold:
                print(f"Refined solution at x = {x_val:.6f} with difference {diff:.2e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solutions()
```
