[write_program]
The problem asks for the minimum value of the sum of four quadratic expressions evaluated at the vertices of a unit square (with side length 1). The vertices are (x,y), (x+1,y), (x+1,y+1), and (x,y+1). 

We can simplify the problem by expanding and combining the expressions. The program will numerically search for the minimum value by evaluating the sum over a grid of (x,y) values centered around the expected minimum point.

```python
def evaluate_sum(x, y):
    # Evaluate the sum for the four points of the unit square
    p1 = x**2 + 2*x + y**2 + 4*y
    p2 = (x+1)**2 + 2*(x+1) + y**2 + 4*y
    p3 = (x+1)**2 + 2*(x+1) + (y+1)**2 + 4*(y+1)
    p4 = x**2 + 2*x + (y+1)**2 + 4*(y+1)
    return p1 + p2 + p3 + p4

def find_minimum():
    min_value = float('inf')
    min_point = None
    
    # Search around the expected minimum region
    for x in [i/10 for i in range(-20, 20)]:
        for y in [i/10 for i in range(-20, 20)]:
            current = evaluate_sum(x, y)
            if current < min_value:
                min_value = current
                min_point = (x, y)
                print(f"New minimum: {min_value} at (x,y)={min_point}")
    
    print(f"\nFinal minimum value found: {min_value}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_minimum()
```
