This problem involves computing the floor of the logarithm base 4 of a sum of powers of 2. To approach this, we'll:

1. Recognize that the sum is a geometric series: sum(2^i) from i=0 to 8640
2. Use the geometric series formula: sum = 2^(8641) - 1
3. The expression becomes floor(log4(1 + 2^8641 - 1)) = floor(log4(2^8641))
4. Simplify using logarithm properties: log4(2^8641) = 8641 * log4(2) = 8641/2
5. The floor of 8641/2 is 4320.5, so the answer is 4320

We'll verify this by computing the exact value in Python using arbitrary precision arithmetic.

```python
import math
from decimal import Decimal, getcontext

# Set sufficient precision for the calculation
getcontext().prec = 10000

# Compute the sum 2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^8640 using geometric series formula
sum_powers = Decimal(2)**8641 - 1

# Compute log4(1 + sum)
log_value = (1 + sum_powers).ln() / Decimal(4).ln()

# Compute floor of the log value
floor_log = math.floor(log_value)

print(f"Floor of log4(1 + sum): {floor_log}")
print(f"Verification: 8641/2 = {8641/2}")
```
