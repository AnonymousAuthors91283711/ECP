[write_program]
This problem asks us to find the least value in the set {x, x+2, x/2, x-2, 2x} for x < -2. We'll write a Python program to enumerate and compare these values for sample x values less than -2 to help conjecture the pattern.

The program will:
1. Test several x values less than -2
2. Calculate all five expressions for each x
3. Print the minimum value found for each x
4. Observe the pattern to conjecture the general answer

```python
def enumerate_min_values():
    # Test several x values less than -2
    test_values = [-3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9, -10]
    
    for x in test_values:
        # Calculate all five expressions
        values = [
            x,
            x + 2,
            x / 2,
            x - 2,
            2 * x
        ]
        # Find and print the minimum value
        min_val = min(values)
        print(f"For x = {x}, minimum value is {min_val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_min_values()
```
