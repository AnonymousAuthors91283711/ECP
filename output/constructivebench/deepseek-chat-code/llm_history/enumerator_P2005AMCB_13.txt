The problem asks to find the product of xₙ for n from 0 to 123, where each xₙ satisfies (4+n)^(xₙ) = 5+n. We can solve for xₙ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides, giving xₙ = ln(5+n)/ln(4+n). The product then becomes the product of these terms from n=0 to 123.

Here's a Python program that computes this product exactly using logarithms and fractions for precise calculation, then prints the exact fractional form and decimal approximation:

```python
from math import log
from fractions import Fraction

def exact_product():
    product = Fraction(1, 1)
    for n in range(124):
        numerator = 5 + n
        denominator = 4 + n
        # Using log identity: log(a)/log(b) = log_b(a)
        # Represent as exact fraction where possible
        term = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
        product *= term
    return product

result = exact_product()
print(f"Exact fractional form: {result}")
print(f"Decimal approximation: {float(result)}")
```
