This problem asks for the number of integer sequences (a₀,a₁,...,a₅) where each aᵢ ≤ i and their sum is exactly 6. We'll enumerate all possible combinations efficiently using recursion with pruning.

The approach:
1. Generate all possible sequences where each aᵢ ranges from -∞ to i (but practically bounded by remaining sum)
2. Count only those sequences whose sum equals 6
3. Use memoization and pruning to optimize the search

```python
def count_sequences():
    total = 0
    # Iterate through all possible values for a0 to a5 with constraints
    for a0 in range(-10, 0 + 1):  # a0 ≤ 0
        remaining = 6 - a0
        if remaining < 0:
            continue
        for a1 in range(-10, 1 + 1):  # a1 ≤ 1
            r1 = remaining - a1
            if r1 < 0:
                continue
            for a2 in range(-10, 2 + 1):  # a2 ≤ 2
                r2 = r1 - a2
                if r2 < 0:
                    continue
                for a3 in range(-10, 3 + 1):  # a3 ≤ 3
                    r3 = r2 - a3
                    if r3 < 0:
                        continue
                    for a4 in range(-10, 4 + 1):  # a4 ≤ 4
                        r4 = r3 - a4
                        if r4 < 0:
                            continue
                        for a5 in range(-10, 5 + 1):  # a5 ≤ 5
                            if r4 - a5 == 0:
                                total += 1
                                # Print each valid sequence found
                                print(f"Found: ({a0},{a1},{a2},{a3},{a4},{a5})")
    return total

print("Counting valid sequences...")
result = count_sequences()
print(f"Total number of sequences: {result}")
```
