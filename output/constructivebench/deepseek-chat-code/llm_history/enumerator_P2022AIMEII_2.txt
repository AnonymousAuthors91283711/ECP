The problem involves calculating a probability expression with three cases and then simplifying the result to a reduced fraction. We need to compute the exact value of the expression and find the denominator in its reduced form.

Here's a Python program that calculates the exact value of the expression and simplifies it to find the denominator:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_probability():
    # Define the probabilities for each case
    case1 = Fraction(2,3) * Fraction(3,4) * Fraction(3,4) + Fraction(1,3) * Fraction(3,4) * Fraction(1,4)
    case2 = Fraction(3,4) * Fraction(3,4) * Fraction(2,3) + Fraction(1,4) * Fraction(3,4) * Fraction(3,4)
    case3 = Fraction(3,4) * Fraction(3,4) * Fraction(2,3) + Fraction(1,4) * Fraction(3,4) * Fraction(3,4)
    
    # Calculate the average of the three cases
    total = (case1 + case2 + case3) / 3
    
    # Simplify the fraction
    simplified = total.limit_denominator()
    
    # Print intermediate results
    print(f"Case 1: {case1} = {float(case1)}")
    print(f"Case 2: {case2} = {float(case2)}")
    print(f"Case 3: {case3} = {float(case3)}")
    print(f"Total before division: {case1 + case2 + case3} = {float(case1 + case2 + case3)}")
    print(f"Final probability: {total} = {float(total)}")
    print(f"Simplified fraction: {simplified}")
    print(f"Denominator: {simplified.denominator}")

compute_probability()
```

The program uses Python's `fractions.Fraction` to maintain exact arithmetic throughout the computation. It calculates each case separately, combines them, and simplifies the final result to find the denominator of the reduced fraction. The output shows intermediate results for verification.
