The problem requires finding natural numbers a and b that satisfy several modular and divisibility conditions. We need to find all possible pairs (a, b) that satisfy these conditions, then identify the specific value of a that makes all conditions true.

The conditions are:
1. a > 0 and b > 0
2. 2a is divisible by 3 (2a ≡ 0 mod 3)
3. 5b is divisible by 8 (5b ≡ 0 mod 8)
4. (5b)/8 = (2a)/3 + 7
5. (3b)/8 = a/3 + 7

We'll approach this by:
1. Finding all a where 2a is divisible by 3 (a must be divisible by 3/2, so a must be multiples of 3)
2. For each valid a, compute the required b from both equations and check consistency
3. Verify all conditions are satisfied

```python
def find_solutions():
    # a must be divisible by 3 since 2a must be divisible by 3
    for a in range(3, 1000, 3):  # reasonable upper bound
        # From condition 4: (5b)/8 = (2a)/3 + 7
        # => 5b = 8*(2a/3 + 7) = (16a)/3 + 56
        # => b = (16a + 168)/15
        b1 = (16 * a + 168) // 15
        
        # From condition 5: (3b)/8 = a/3 + 7
        # => 3b = 8*(a/3 + 7) = (8a)/3 + 56
        # => b = (8a + 168)/9
        b2 = (8 * a + 168) // 9
        
        # Both must give same b and satisfy all conditions
        if b1 == b2 and b1 > 0:
            # Check 5b divisible by 8
            if (5 * b1) % 8 == 0:
                print(f"Found solution: a = {a}, b = {b1}")
                # Verify all conditions
                assert 2 * a % 3 == 0
                assert 5 * b1 % 8 == 0
                assert (5 * b1) // 8 == (2 * a) // 3 + 7
                assert (3 * b1) // 8 == a // 3 + 7
                return a  # return first valid solution (smallest a)
    
    print("No solution found in range")
    return None
