This problem is asking to find the maximum possible sum of four single-digit natural numbers (each between 1 and 9 inclusive). The solution is straightforward since the maximum sum occurs when all four numbers are 9.

Here's a Python program that enumerates all possible combinations of four digits (1-9) and finds the maximum sum:

```python
max_sum = 0
for m in range(1, 10):
    for n in range(1, 10):
        for p in range(1, 10):
            for q in range(1, 10):
                current_sum = m + n + p + q
                if current_sum > max_sum:
                    max_sum = current_sum
                    # Print new maximum found
                    print(f"New maximum sum: {max_sum} with digits {m}, {n}, {p}, {q}")
# After checking all combinations, print the final maximum
print(f"Final maximum sum: {max_sum}")
```

The program will quickly find that the maximum sum is 36 (9+9+9+9) and print this result. The enumeration is complete but not particularly optimized since we know the maximum must occur when all digits are 9, but the problem asks for enumeration.
