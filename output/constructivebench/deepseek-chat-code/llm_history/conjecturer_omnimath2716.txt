theorem omnimath2716 (c : ℤ) (h : (X ^ 2 + 12 * X + C c).IsRoot 18) :
    (X ^ 2 + 12 * X + C c).IsRoot (omnimath2716_answer c) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: c = -540
Second root = -30
Verification passed. Expected Answer Type: ℤ → ℤ
From the problem and enumerated answer, we can see:
1. Given polynomial X² + 12X + c with root 18
2. When c = -540, the other root is -30
3. For a quadratic x² + bx + c, if one root is r₁, the other root r₂ must satisfy r₁ + r₂ = -b and r₁ * r₂ = c
4. Here b=12, so if r₁=18, then r₂ = -12 - 18 = -30
5. The answer is always the other root, which is -12 minus the input root (18 in this case)
