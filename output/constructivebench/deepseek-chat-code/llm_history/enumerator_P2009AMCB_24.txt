[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of real numbers x in the interval [0, π] that satisfy the equation arcsin(sin(6x)) = arccos(cos(x)). We'll write a Python program to numerically find and count these solutions.

The approach is to:
1. Sample points in [0, π] with small increments
2. Check if the equation holds within a small tolerance
3. Count distinct solutions (grouping nearby points)

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def find_solutions():
    # Parameters
    start = 0.0
    end = math.pi
    step = 0.0001  # Small step for accuracy
    tolerance = 1e-6
    
    solutions = []
    x = start
    while x <= end:
        lhs = math.asin(math.sin(6 * x))
        rhs = math.acos(math.cos(x))
        if abs(lhs - rhs) < tolerance:
            # Check if this is a new solution (not too close to previous ones)
            if not solutions or (x - solutions[-1]) > tolerance * 10:
                solutions.append(x)
                print(f"Found solution at x ≈ {x:.4f}")
        x += step
    
    print(f"\nTotal distinct solutions found: {len(solutions)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solutions()
```
