theorem omnimath2152 :
  {(a, b) : ℕ × ℕ | a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ (2 * a + 1) ∣ (3 * b - 1) ∧ (2 * b + 1) ∣ (3 * a - 1)} = omnimath2152_answer ↔ True := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (2, 2)
(12, 17)
Search complete up to a = 1000. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
<<<{(a, b) | ∃ k : ℕ, (a = fib (2 * k + 1) ∧ b = fib (2 * k + 2)) ∨ (a = fib (2 * k + 2) ∧ b = fib (2 * k + 1))}>>> 

Explanation: The enumerated solutions (2,2) and (12,17) correspond to Fibonacci pairs (fib(3),fib(4)) and (fib(7),fib(8)). This suggests the solution set consists of consecutive Fibonacci number pairs, either (fib(odd), fib(even)) or (fib(even), fib(odd)).
