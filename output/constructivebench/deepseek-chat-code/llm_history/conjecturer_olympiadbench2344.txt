. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the problem statement and the fact that no valid `n` was found in the enumeration, it appears there might be no solution satisfying all the given conditions. The problem requires finding a non-zero natural number `n` that satisfies certain geometric sequence conditions, but the enumeration suggests no such `n` exists.
