[write_program]
This problem asks for all real values of k where the equation r⁴ + k·r³ + r² + 4k·r + 16 = 0 has exactly one real solution. We'll write a Python program to find such k values by checking when the quartic equation has exactly one real root (which occurs when it has a triple root or a single root plus a complex conjugate pair).

The approach will be:
1. Find when the equation has a triple root (which requires both the function and its first two derivatives to be zero at some point)
2. Check for cases with one real root and a complex conjugate pair
3. Output any found k values

```python
import numpy as np
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, diff, real_roots

def find_k_values():
    r = symbols('r')
    k_values = set()
    
    # Case 1: Triple root condition (r-a)³*(r-b) = 0
    # We solve system where f(a)=f'(a)=f''(a)=0
    for a in np.linspace(-5, 5, 1000):  # Sample potential roots
        a = round(a, 3)  # Reduce precision for numerical stability
        if a == 0:
            continue  # Avoid division by zero in later steps
            
        # Coefficients for triple root condition
        k1 = -(4*a**2 + a + 4)/(a*(a + 4))
        k2 = -(2*a + 1)/(3*a + 4)
        k3 = -(8*a + 1)/(12*a + 3)
        
        # Find k where all conditions are approximately equal
        if abs(k1 - k2) < 1e-4 and abs(k1 - k3) < 1e-4:
            k = round(float(k1), 5)
            # Verify by counting real roots
            poly = r**4 + k*r**3 + r**2 + 4*k*r + 16
            roots = real_roots(poly)
            if len(roots) == 1:
                print(f"Found k with triple root: {k}")
                k_values.add(k)
    
    # Case 2: Single real root plus complex conjugate pair
    # We'll sample k values and count real roots
    for k in np.linspace(-10, 10, 2000):
        k = round(k, 3)
        poly = r**4 + k*r**3 + r**2 + 4*k*r + 16
        roots = real_roots(poly)
        if len(roots) == 1:
            print(f"Found k with single real root: {k}")
            k_values.add(k)
    
    print("\nAll found k values:", sorted(k_values))

find_k_values()
```
