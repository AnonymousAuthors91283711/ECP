From the enumerated answers, we observe that only the zero function and linear functions with zero constant term (f(x) = x and f(x) = -x) satisfy the given functional equation. The pattern suggests the solution set consists of these three functions.

Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
From the enumerated answers, we can see that only three functions satisfy the condition:
1. The zero function f(x) = 0
2. The identity function f(x) = x
3. The negative identity function f(x) = -x

The error in the original proposal comes from incorrect syntax for defining a set of functions in Lean. We need to use proper set notation with `∨` between the function conditions, and ensure each function is properly typed as ℝ → ℝ.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<{f | f = (fun x : ℝ => (0 : ℝ)) ∨ f = (fun x : ℝ => x) ∨ f = (fun x : ℝ => -x)}>>>

Explanation:
1. The set contains all functions f: ℝ → ℝ that satisfy one of three conditions
2. Each condition is explicitly typed with ℝ inputs and outputs
3. The zero function is properly specified with type annotation (0 : ℝ)
4. The identity and negative identity functions are similarly properly typed
5. The conditions are combined with logical OR (∨) as required for set definition

This matches exactly with the enumerated results where only these three functions passed all test cases. The solution captures all possible functions that satisfy the given functional equation.
