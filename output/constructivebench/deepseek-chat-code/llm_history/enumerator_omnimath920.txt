This problem appears to be about finding numbers that are equal to the sum of their digits each raised to the power of the number of digits (Narcissistic numbers). For 3-digit numbers, these are known to be 153, 370, 371, and 407. The Python program will enumerate and verify these numbers.

```python
def is_narcissistic(n):
    digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]
    k = len(digits)
    return n == sum(d**k for d in digits)

# Check all 3-digit numbers
for n in range(100, 1000):
    if is_narcissistic(n):
        print(n)
```
