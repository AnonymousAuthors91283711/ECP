Verification at x=3:
x=3: 0.3680339887. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Looking at the pattern where the equation holds, the value seems to be around x=3. The equation simplifies when x=3, making it a likely candidate. The enumerated values show the LHS decreasing as x increases, with x=3 being close to the target 0.25.
