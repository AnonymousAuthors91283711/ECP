This problem involves finding for which values of sin(θ) the quadratic equation in r has exactly one real solution. A quadratic equation has exactly one real solution when its discriminant is zero. We'll write a program to enumerate possible values of sin(θ) that satisfy this condition.

The quadratic equation is: (sin θ)r² + (cos θ + tan θ)r + 1 = 0
The discriminant D must be zero: D = (cos θ + tan θ)² - 4*sin θ*1 = 0

We'll express everything in terms of sin θ (let's call it x) and cos θ (√(1-x²)), then solve for x. Note that tan θ = sin θ/cos θ = x/√(1-x²).

```python
import math

def find_sin_theta_values():
    # We'll test values of x = sin(theta) in [-1, 1] with small steps
    step = 0.00001
    threshold = 1e-8  # For considering discriminant close enough to zero
    
    for x in [i * step for i in range(-int(1/step), int(1/step)+1)]:
        try:
            if abs(x) == 1:  # Avoid division by zero in tan(theta)
                continue
                
            cos_theta = math.sqrt(1 - x**2)
            tan_theta = x / cos_theta
            discriminant = (cos_theta + tan_theta)**2 - 4 * x * 1
            
            if abs(discriminant) < threshold:
                print(f"sin(theta) ≈ {x:.5f}")
                
        except ValueError:
            continue  # Skip invalid square roots

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_sin_theta_values()
```

The program searches for values of sin(θ) where the discriminant is approximately zero. It avoids x=±1 where tan(θ) would be undefined. The output shows candidate values where the equation has exactly one real solution.
