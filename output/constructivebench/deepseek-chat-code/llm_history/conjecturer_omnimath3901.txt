From the problem's symmetry and the given conditions, we can conjecture that the solution involves cyclic permutations of the variables. The enumerated answers suggest the pattern where (x,y,z) are the roots of a symmetric equation. The most natural symmetric solution would be the variables themselves in some permutation.
