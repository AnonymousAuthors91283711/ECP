This problem asks for the largest subset S of natural numbers where:
1. S is "interval-closed" (if a â‰¤ b are in S, then all numbers between a and b are in S)
2. No number in S has a digit sum divisible by 11
3. We want to maximize the size of S

We'll approach this by:
1. Generating candidate intervals that satisfy the digit sum condition
2. Finding the largest such interval
3. Verifying the properties

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

def is_valid(n):
    return digit_sum(n) % 11 != 0

def find_max_interval():
    max_size = 0
    best_interval = (0, 0)
    
    # We'll check intervals starting at various points up to 10000
    for start in range(0, 10000):
        current_size = 0
        end = start
        while end < start + 1000:  # Limit search range for efficiency
            if is_valid(end):
                current_size = end - start + 1
                end += 1
            else:
                break
        
        if current_size > max_size:
            max_size = current_size
            best_interval = (start, start + current_size - 1)
            print(f"New max interval found: {best_interval} with size {max_size}")
    
    print(f"\nFinal largest interval: {best_interval} with size {max_size}")
    return max_size

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_max_interval()
```

The program searches for the largest interval [a,b] where all numbers in the interval have digit sums not divisible by 11. It starts checking from 0 upwards, and for each starting point, it tries to extend the interval as far as possible while maintaining the digit sum condition. The program prints new maximum intervals as they are found, and finally reports the largest one discovered.

Note that the actual mathematical proof would need to establish that no larger interval exists, but this computational approach helps identify candidate intervals that likely contain the maximal solution. The largest interval found this way is likely to be the answer, but a formal proof would be needed to confirm it's indeed the maximum possible.
