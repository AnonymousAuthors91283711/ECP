[write_program]
The problem asks to find the sum of all positive integers m such that 13! can be written as m*kÂ² for some integer k. The sum should be expressed in terms of the prime factors of 13! (2,3,5,7,11,13) with positive exponents, and the sum of these exponents is the final answer.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Factorize 13! into its prime factors
2. Generate all possible m values by considering all combinations of exponents (odd exponents in the prime factorization)
3. Calculate the sum of all valid m values
4. Factorize this sum and compute the sum of exponents

```python
import math
from itertools import product

def main():
    # Prime factors of 13! with their exponents
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
    exponents = [10, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1]
    
    # Generate all possible combinations of exponents for m
    # For each prime, we can choose exponents from 0 to original exponent,
    # but must be odd if we include it in m
    possible_exponents = []
    for p, e in zip(primes, exponents):
        options = [0]  # exclude prime
        for x in range(1, e+1, 2):  # include with odd exponent
            options.append(x)
        possible_exponents.append(options)
    
    total_sum = 0
    # Iterate through all combinations of exponents
    for exp_comb in product(*possible_exponents):
        m = 1
        for p, e in zip(primes, exp_comb):
            m *= p ** e
        if m > 0:
            total_sum += m
    
    # Factorize the total_sum
    factors = {}
    remaining = total_sum
    for p in primes:
        if remaining == 1:
            break
        count = 0
        while remaining % p == 0:
            count += 1
            remaining = remaining // p
        if count > 0:
            factors[p] = count
    
    # Print the factorization and sum of exponents
    print("Total sum:", total_sum)
    print("Factorization:")
    sum_exp = 0
    for p in primes:
        exp = factors.get(p, 0)
        print(f"{p}^{exp}", end=" * " if p != 13 else "")
        sum_exp += exp
    print("\nSum of exponents:", sum_exp)
