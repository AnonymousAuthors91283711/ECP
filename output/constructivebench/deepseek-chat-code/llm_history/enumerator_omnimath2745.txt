This problem asks to find a list of 3 distinct numbers from the set {2, 3, 4, 6} that sum to 11, and then determine their product. We'll enumerate all possible combinations to find the valid ones.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def solve():
    numbers = [2, 3, 4, 6]
    target_sum = 11
    length = 3
    
    print("Searching for combinations of 3 distinct numbers from [2, 3, 4, 6] that sum to 11:")
    found = False
    
    for combo in combinations(numbers, length):
        if sum(combo) == target_sum and len(set(combo)) == length:
            product = 1
            for num in combo:
                product *= num
            print(f"Found combination: {combo}, sum={sum(combo)}, product={product}")
            found = True
    
    if not found:
        print("No valid combination found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```
