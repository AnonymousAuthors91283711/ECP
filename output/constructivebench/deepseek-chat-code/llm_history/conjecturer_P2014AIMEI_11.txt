theorem P2014AIMEI_11 :
  let totalPaths := 4^6
  let validPaths := 2 * (choose 6 3) * (choose 3 1) + 2 * (choose 6 1) * (choose 5 2) + 2 * (choose 6 0) * (choose 6 3)
  ∃ m n : ℕ, Coprime m n ∧ validPaths / totalPaths = m / n ∧ m + n = P2014AIMEI_11_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Reduced fraction: 35/512
Final answer (m+n): 547. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
