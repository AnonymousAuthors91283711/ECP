The problem appears to be a system of equations with natural number constraints. We need to find values for d, gd, and x that satisfy all given conditions, then compute d + (gd - x) as the final answer. The conditions are:
1. d = 6
2. d + gd = 30
3. x ≤ d
4. gd = 6 * x

We'll solve this by enumerating possible values of x (since it's constrained by x ≤ d and d=6), then checking the other conditions.

```python
def solve_problem():
    d = 6  # Given condition
    for x in range(0, d + 1):  # x ≤ d
        gd = 6 * x  # gd = 6 * x
        if d + gd == 30:  # Check d + gd = 30
            answer = d + (gd - x)
            print(f"x={x}, gd={gd}, answer={answer}")
            return answer  # Return first valid answer since x is unique

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_problem()
```
