[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimal possible absolute value of the sum of a sequence x_k where:
- x_0 = 0
- For each k â‰¥ 1, |x_k| = |x_{k-1} + 3|
- The sum is taken over the first 2006 terms (x_1 to x_2006)

We'll model this as a dynamic programming problem where at each step, x_k can be either (x_{k-1} + 3) or -(x_{k-1} + 3). We'll track possible sums and their minimal absolute values.

```python
def main():
    n = 2006  # Number of terms in the sum
    # We'll track possible (current_x, current_sum) pairs
    # Initialize with x0 = 0, sum = 0
    current = {(0, 0)}
    
    min_abs_sum = float('inf')
    
    for k in range(1, n+1):
        next_states = set()
        for (x_prev, sum_prev) in current:
            # Two possible choices for x_k
            x1 = x_prev + 3
            sum1 = sum_prev + x1
            next_states.add((x1, sum1))
            
            x2 = -(x_prev + 3)
            sum2 = sum_prev + x2
            next_states.add((x2, sum2))
        
        current = next_states
        
        # Track minimal absolute sum at each step (optional)
        current_min = min(abs(s) for (x, s) in current)
        if current_min < min_abs_sum:
            min_abs_sum = current_min
            print(f"After {k} terms, new min abs sum: {min_abs_sum}")
    
    # Final result
    print(f"Final minimal absolute sum for n={n}: {min_abs_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
