From the enumerated answers, we can observe that the count increases by 1 for each new combination of divisors of 2009 (since 2009 = 7 × 7 × 41). The maximum count seen is 29, which suggests the answer relates to the number of ordered pairs of divisors of 2009. The number of positive divisors of 2009 is 6 (1,7,41,49,287,2009), and the number of ordered pairs would be 6 × 6 = 36, but our count stops at 29. However, looking at the pattern, the answer seems to be the number of ordered pairs (d₁, d₂) where d₁ divides d₂, which for 6 divisors would be 6+5+4+3+2+1 = 21 (but we see counts higher than this). 

Given the complexity, the most plausible answer based on the enumeration is the maximum count observed plus some increment, but since we don't see the full enumeration, the safest answer is the number of positive divisors of 2009 squared (36), though this doesn't match the partial enumeration. Alternatively, it might be the triangular number T₆ = 21.

Given the partial data, the most reasonable answer is:
<<<21>>>
