Ground Truth Answer: 20
Proposed Answer: 10
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have a system of equations with variables D, e, h where D > 0
2. From heq: e = 9h
3. From h1: 4(e + h) = 3e + Dh + 16
4. From h2: 3e + Dh = 3(De + 3h)/2

Let's solve step by step:

Substitute e = 9h into h1:
4(9h + h) = 3(9h) + Dh + 16
40h = 27h + Dh + 16
13h - Dh = 16
h(13 - D) = 16 ...(a)

Substitute e = 9h into h2:
3(9h) + Dh = 3(D*9h + 3h)/2
27h + Dh = (27Dh + 9h)/2
Multiply both sides by 2:
54h + 2Dh = 27Dh + 9h
45h = 25Dh
45 = 25D (since h ≠ 0)
D = 45/25 = 9/5

But D must be a natural number (ℕ) and D > 0. 9/5 is not a natural number, so there's no solution in ℕ.

However, the ground truth claims e + h = 20 while proposed answer says 10. Neither makes sense since there's no natural number solution. But the proposed answer is exactly half of the ground truth, suggesting a calculation error.
