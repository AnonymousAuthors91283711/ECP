abbrev omnimath4033_answer : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath4033 (n k : ℕ) (hk : k < n) :
  IsGreatest {m : ℕ | ∃ (B : Fin m → Set (Fin n)) (C : Fin m → Set (Fin n)),
    (∀ i, Nat.card (B i) = k) ∧
    (∀ i, C i ⊆ B i) ∧
    (∀ i j, i ≠ j → B i ∩ C j ≠ B j ∩ C i)} (omnimath4033_answer n k) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: timeout triggered. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun n k => Nat.choose (n - 1) (k - 1)>>> 

Explanation: The problem relates to set systems with specific intersection properties. The pattern suggests binomial coefficients based on n-1 and k-1, which often appear in combinatorial designs. The answer matches the expected type ℕ → ℕ → ℕ.
