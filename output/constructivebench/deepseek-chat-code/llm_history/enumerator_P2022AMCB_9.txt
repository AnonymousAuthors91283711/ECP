This problem asks for the smallest second term (a₂) in an arithmetic sequence where:
1. The sequence is strictly increasing (aₙ = a₀ + n*d)
2. The 7th term minus 27 equals log₂ of the 7th term
3. We need to find the minimal a₂ = a₀ + 2d

We'll search for valid (a₀, d) pairs by:
1. Iterating possible d values (positive integers)
2. For each d, compute possible a₀ values that satisfy the equation
3. Check if all conditions are met
4. Track the minimal a₂ found

```python
import math

def find_min_a2():
    min_a2 = float('inf')
    # Iterate possible d values (1 to 100 is sufficient)
    for d in range(1, 101):
        # The 7th term is a0 + 7d
        # Equation: (a0 + 7d) - 27 = log2(a0 + 7d)
        # Let x = a0 + 7d, then x - 27 = log2(x)
        # We'll find x that satisfies this equation
        for x in range(1, 10**6):
            if x - 27 == math.log2(x):
                a0 = x - 7*d
                if a0 > 0:  # a0 must be positive
                    a2 = a0 + 2*d
                    if a2 < min_a2:
                        min_a2 = a2
                        print(f"Found candidate: a0={a0}, d={d}, a2={a2}")
        # Early exit if we found the minimal possible a2 (d=1 gives smallest possible a2)
        if min_a2 != float('inf') and d > min_a2//2:
            break
    print(f"Minimal a2 found: {min_a2}")

find_min_a2()
