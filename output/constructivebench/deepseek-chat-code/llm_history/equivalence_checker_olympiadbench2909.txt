Ground Truth Answer: 800
Proposed Answer: 803
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. From hP, we know P is a quadratic polynomial with roots r1 and r2. By Vieta's formulas:
   - r1 + r2 = -T (coefficient of X term)
   - r1 * r2 = 800 (constant term)

2. The polynomial Q is defined as:
   Q = X² + (r1 + r2 + 2) + (r1*r2 + r1 + r2)

3. We need to compute Q.coeff 0 + Q.coeff 1 + Q.coeff 2:
   - coeff 2 (X² term) = 1
   - coeff 1 (X term) = 0 (since there's no X term in Q's definition)
   - coeff 0 (constant term) = r1*r2 + r1 + r2

4. Therefore, the sum is:
   1 + 0 + (r1*r2 + r1 + r2) = 1 + r1*r2 + r1 + r2

5. Substituting Vieta's results:
   = 1 + 800 + (-T) = 801 - T

However, the problem doesn't provide any information about T, and both answers (800 and 803) are constants independent of T. This suggests there might be missing information or a misunderstanding in the problem statement or answers.

Given that:
- The ground truth answer is 800
- The proposed answer is 803
- Neither matches our derived expression (801 - T)
