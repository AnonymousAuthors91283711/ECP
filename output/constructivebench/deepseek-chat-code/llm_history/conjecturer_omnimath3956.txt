theorem omnimath3956
    (P : (ℕ → ℕ) → Prop)
    (hP : ∀ f, P f ↔ ∀ m n : ℕ, f (m + n) ≥ f m + f (f n) - 1) :
    {y : ℕ | ∃ f : ℕ → ℕ, P f ∧ f 2007 = y} = omnimath3956_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing linear functions f(n) = n + c:
f(n) = n + 0 satisfies the condition
f(2007) would be 2007

Possible values for f(2007):
Possible solution: f(2007) = 2007 (using f(n) = n + 0). Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{2007}>>>
