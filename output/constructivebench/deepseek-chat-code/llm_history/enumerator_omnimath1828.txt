This problem involves complex numbers and polynomial roots. We need to find all complex numbers x (x ≠ 0) such that r = x + 1/x is a root of the polynomial X³ + X² - 2X - 1, and then verify the relationship x⁷ + x⁻⁷ = some function of x.

We'll approach this by:
1. Finding all roots r of the given cubic polynomial
2. For each r, solve x + 1/x = r to get possible x values
3. Compute x⁷ + x⁻⁷ for each x and look for patterns

```python
import cmath
import numpy as np

# Coefficients of the polynomial X^3 + X^2 - 2X - 1
coeffs = [1, 1, -2, -1]

# Find all roots of the polynomial
roots = np.roots(coeffs)

print("Roots r of X^3 + X^2 - 2X - 1:")
for r in roots:
    print(f"r = {r}")

print("\nSolutions x to x + 1/x = r:")
for r in roots:
    # Solve quadratic equation x^2 - r*x + 1 = 0
    discriminant = r**2 - 4
    x1 = (r + cmath.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
    x2 = (r - cmath.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
    
    print(f"\nFor r = {r}:")
    print(f"x1 = {x1}")
    print(f"x2 = {x2}")
    
    # Compute x^7 + x^-7 for each solution
    for x in [x1, x2]:
        if abs(x) > 1e-10:  # avoid division by zero
            x_pow_7 = x**7
            x_pow_minus7 = 1/x_pow_7
            result = x_pow_7 + x_pow_minus7
            print(f"x^7 + x^-7 = {result}")
```
