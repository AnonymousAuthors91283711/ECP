Ground Truth Answer: {100, 110, 11}
Proposed Answer: {11, 100, 110}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer and ground truth answer contain exactly the same elements, just in a different order. Since sets are unordered collections, the two answers are equivalent. The elements {100, 110, 11} are identical to {11, 100, 110}.
