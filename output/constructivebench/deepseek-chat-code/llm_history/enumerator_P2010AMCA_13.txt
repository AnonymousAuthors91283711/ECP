[write_program]
This problem asks to determine when the circle x² + y² = k² and the hyperbola xy = k are disjoint (no intersection points). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible k values and check for intersections.

The approach is:
1. Solve the system of equations x² + y² = k² and xy = k
2. Substitute y = k/x into the circle equation to get x⁴ - k²x² + k² = 0
3. Check the discriminant D = k⁴ - 4k² = k²(k² - 4)
4. When D < 0, there are no real solutions (disjoint)
5. We'll test integer k values to find when the curves are disjoint

```python
def check_disjoint(k):
    """Check if x²+y²=k² and xy=k are disjoint for given k."""
    if k == 0:
        return True  # Both degenerate to single point/undefined
    discriminant = k**4 - 4 * k**2
    return discriminant < 0

def main():
    print("Checking for which integer k the curves are disjoint:")
    for k in range(-5, 6):
        result = check_disjoint(k)
        print(f"k={k}: {'Disjoint' if result else 'Intersects'}")
    
    print("\nTesting non-integer k=1.9 (should intersect):")
    print(f"k=1.9: {'Disjoint' if check_disjoint(1.9) else 'Intersects'}")
    print("k=2.1 (should be disjoint):")
    print(f"k=2.1: {'Disjoint' if check_disjoint(2.1) else 'Intersects'}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
