Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: Prop
From the enumerated answers, we observe that the only digit sequences where all numbers formed are squares are the single-digit perfect squares: 1, 4, 9. For any multi-digit sequence, we eventually find non-squares. Therefore, the answer is that no infinite sequence exists where all sufficiently long numbers are squares.
