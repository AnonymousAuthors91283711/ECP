[write_program]
The problem appears to be calculating a simple percentage-based multiplication. We'll write a Python program that computes the exact value of the expression `100 * (120 / 100) * (150 / 100)` and prints it. Since this is a straightforward calculation, we'll just compute and output the result directly.

```python
# Calculate 100 * (120/100) * (150/100)
result = 100 * (120 / 100) * (150 / 100)
print(result)
```
