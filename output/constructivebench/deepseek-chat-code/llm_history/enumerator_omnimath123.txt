[write_program]
This problem asks to find positive integers k such that p = 6k+1 is prime and the binomial coefficient C(3k,k) ≡ 1 mod p. We'll write a Python program to search for such k values up to a reasonable threshold.

The program will:
1. Iterate k from 1 upwards
2. For each k, compute p = 6k+1
3. Check if p is prime
4. If prime, compute C(3k,k) mod p and check if it's 1
5. Print any k that satisfies all conditions

We'll use sympy for primality testing and binomial coefficients, and set a search limit of 1000 for k.

```python
from sympy import isprime, binomial

max_k = 1000
print(f"Searching for k where p=6k+1 is prime and C(3k,k) ≡ 1 mod p, up to k={max_k}")

for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
    p = 6 * k + 1
    if isprime(p):
        c = binomial(3 * k, k)
        if c % p == 1:
            print(f"Found k = {k} (p = {p})")
```
