This problem involves solving a system of equations with variables a and r (where r ≠ 0). The equations are:
1. a * r = 2
2. a * r^3 = 6

We need to find all possible real values of a that satisfy these equations. The solution involves eliminating one variable and solving for the other.

Here's a Python program that enumerates possible solutions by:
1. Solving the first equation for a in terms of r
2. Substituting into the second equation to get an equation in r
3. Solving for r and then finding corresponding a values
4. Checking both real solutions

```python
import math

def solve_system():
    # We have two equations:
    # 1) a*r = 2 => a = 2/r
    # 2) a*r^3 = 6
    # Substitute a from first into second: (2/r)*r^3 = 6 => 2r^2 = 6 => r^2 = 3
    # So r = ±sqrt(3)
    
    # Calculate possible r values
    r_values = [math.sqrt(3), -math.sqrt(3)]
    
    # Calculate corresponding a values
    for r in r_values:
        a = 2 / r
        print(f"Found solution: a = {a}, r = {r}")
    
    # The problem suggests one solution is a = 2*sqrt(3)/3
    # Let's verify this matches one of our solutions
    expected_a = 2 * math.sqrt(3) / 3
    print(f"\nVerification: 2*sqrt(3)/3 ≈ {expected_a}")
