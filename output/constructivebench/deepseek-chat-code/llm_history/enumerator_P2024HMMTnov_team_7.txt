This problem involves counting valid grid configurations where the black and white areas are equal in a specific coloring scheme. We'll enumerate all possible vertical and horizontal cut configurations for a 7x7 grid (represented as boolean vectors) and count those that satisfy the area equality condition.

```python
from itertools import product

def solve():
    n = 7
    total = 0
    
    # Iterate all possible vertical and horizontal cut combinations
    for v_cuts in product([False, True], repeat=n):
        for h_cuts in product([False, True], repeat=n):
            black = 0
            
            # Check each cell in the 8x8 grid
            for i in range(8):
                for j in range(8):
                    # Determine if cell (i,j) is on a cut
                    on_cut = False
                    if i < n and v_cuts[i] and j < 8:
                        on_cut = True
                    if j < n and h_cuts[j] and i < 8:
                        on_cut = True
                    
                    # Calculate coloring
                    parity = (i + j + (0 if on_cut else 1)) % 2
                    if parity == 0:
                        black += 1
            
            # Check if areas are equal
            if black == 32:
                total += 1
                print(f"Found valid configuration #{total}")
    
    print(f"Total valid configurations: {total}")

solve()
```
