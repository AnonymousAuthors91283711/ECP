theorem omnimath3691 (P : ℤ[X]) :
  P.eval 0 ≠ 0 ∧ (∀ (n m : ℕ), ∃ (k : ℤ), P.eval (n : ℤ) ^ m * P.eval (m : ℤ) ^ n = k^2) ↔ P = omnimath3691_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing polynomials of form a + bx + cx^2 with coefficients in [-2,-1,1,2]
Polynomials satisfying the condition:
1
1 - 2x + 1x^2
1 + 2x + 1x^2. Expected Answer Type: ℤ[X]
<<<1 + X + X ^ 2>>>
