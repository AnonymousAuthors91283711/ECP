This problem involves finding the sum q + r given four consecutive integers p, q, r, s where p + s = 109. The relationships show they are consecutive decreasing integers (p = q-1, q = r-1, r = s-1). We can model this by expressing all variables in terms of p and solving the equation.

The Python program will:
1. Express all variables in terms of p (q = p+1, r = p+2, s = p+3)
2. Use the equation p + s = 109 to find p
3. Calculate q + r based on the found p

```python
# Express variables in terms of p: q=p+1, r=p+2, s=p+3
# Given p + s = 109 => p + (p+3) = 109 => 2p + 3 = 109 => p = 53
p = (109 - 3) // 2
q = p + 1
r = p + 2
sum_qr = q + r
print(f"p = {p}, q = {q}, r = {r}, s = {p+3}")
print(f"q + r = {sum_qr}")
```
