. Enumerated Answers: Testing p = 15.0:
q = 6.0, p*q = 90.0
Testing p = -15.0:
q = -6.0, p*q = 90.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The error occurs because you're trying to use logical disjunction (∨) between numbers, which is only valid between propositions. Since we need to return a single real number (ℝ) that satisfies both conditions, but there are two possible solutions (15 and -15), we need to choose one representation.

Looking at the enumerated answers, both p=15 and p=-15 satisfy the conditions when paired with their corresponding q values. However, since the function must return a single ℝ value, we can choose either one as the answer. The positive solution is typically preferred in such cases.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<15>>>

Explanation:
1. From h₁: q = (2/5)*p
2. From h₂: p*q = p*(2/5*p) = (2/5)*p² = 90
3. Solving: p² = 90*(5/2) = 225 → p = ±15
4. Both solutions work as shown in the enumerated answers
5. The answer is represented as a single real number (15) rather than a disjunction
