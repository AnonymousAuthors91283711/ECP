This problem involves calculating a probability ratio from the 2024 AIME I Problem 4. We need to compute the ratio of two probabilities: the probability of winning (drawing all 4 special items) divided by the probability of getting a prize (drawing 2-4 special items). The answer should be a reduced fraction.

We'll:
1. Calculate the exact probabilities using combinatorics
2. Compute their ratio and simplify it
3. Output the numerator and denominator of the simplified fraction

```python
from math import comb
from fractions import Fraction

def solve():
    total_items = 10
    special_items = 4
    draw_size = 4
    
    # Probability of winning (all 4 are special)
    p_win = comb(special_items, draw_size) * comb(total_items - special_items, 0) / comb(total_items, draw_size)
    
    # Probability of getting a prize (2-4 special items)
    p_prize = 0
    for k in range(2, 5):  # 2, 3, 4 special items
        p_prize += comb(special_items, k) * comb(total_items - special_items, draw_size - k)
    p_prize /= comb(total_items, draw_size)
    
    # Compute the ratio and simplify
    ratio = Fraction(int(p_win * 1e10), int(p_prize * 1e10)).limit_denominator()
    
    # Exact calculation to avoid floating point errors
    numerator = comb(special_items, draw_size) * comb(total_items - special_items, 0)
    denominator = sum(comb(special_items, k) * comb(total_items - special_items, draw_size - k) for k in range(2, 5))
    exact_ratio = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
    
    print(f"{exact_ratio.numerator}/{exact_ratio.denominator}")
