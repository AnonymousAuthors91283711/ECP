This problem involves finding the value of g(9) given specific conditions about polynomials f and g. We'll approach it by:
1. Finding the roots of f (which is XÂ³ + X + 1)
2. Using the condition that g's roots are squares of f's roots
3. Constructing g based on its roots and the condition g(0) = -1
4. Evaluating g(9)

We'll implement this numerically since exact solutions would involve complex radicals. The program will:
1. Find the real root of f numerically
2. Construct g based on the conditions
3. Compute g(9)

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.polynomial import Polynomial

# Find the real root of f(x) = x^3 + x + 1
f = Polynomial([1, 1, 0, 1])  # x^3 + x + 1
roots = f.roots()
real_root = [r for r in roots if np.isreal(r)][0].real

# Construct g(x) = a(x - r^2) where r is f's real root, and g(0) = -1
r_squared = real_root**2
a = -1 / (-r_squared)  # Because g(0) = a*(0 - r_squared) = -1
g = Polynomial([-a*r_squared, a])  # a*x - a*r_squared

# Evaluate g(9)
result = g(9)
print(f"g(9) = {result}")
```
