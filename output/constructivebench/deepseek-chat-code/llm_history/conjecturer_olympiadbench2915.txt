<<<5^3 + 5^2 + B * 5 + C>>> 

Explanation: The problem gives a cubic polynomial identity and asks for its value at x=5. The enumerated answers suggest no valid α exists, so we must express the answer directly in terms of the polynomial evaluated at 5, using the given coefficients B and C from the identity.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the problem, we need to find the value of the cubic polynomial evaluated at x=5, given its factored form. The error occurs because B and C are parameters in the theorem, not in the answer definition. We need to express the answer purely in terms of α.

From the factored form (x-2α)(x-(cosα)²)(x+(1/sinα)²), we can:
1. Expand it to match x³ + x² + Bx + C
2. Evaluate at x=5 to get (5-2α)(5-(cosα)²)(5+(1/sinα)²)

The enumerated answers suggest α must satisfy certain conditions (sinα≠0), but we don't need to solve for α - we can express the answer directly in terms of the polynomial evaluation.

<<<(5 - 2 * α) * (5 - (cos α)^2) * (5 + (1 / sin α)^2)>>>

Explanation:
The answer is simply the polynomial evaluation at x=5 using the given factored form. This avoids needing to know B and C explicitly, and works for any α where sinα≠0 (which is implied by the problem statement since 1/sinα appears). The expansion would give us B and C in terms of α, but we can skip that step by directly evaluating the factored form.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error occurs because the proposed answer references `α` which is not in scope for the abbreviation. The answer needs to be a constant value in ℝ, not dependent on α. From the problem statement, we need to evaluate the polynomial at x=5, which is given by the factorization (x - 2α)(x - (cos α)²)(x + (1/sin α)²). However, the enumerated answers suggest that no valid α exists that satisfies the identity, implying the polynomial might be identically zero or have special properties.

Looking at the polynomial identity, if we expand the right side and compare coefficients with the left side (x³ + x² + Bx + C), we can solve for B and C in terms of α. Then evaluating at x=5 would give us a constant expression. However, since the enumerated answers show no valid α, the polynomial must be identically zero, meaning all coefficients must be zero. Therefore, the evaluation at x=5 should be 0.

<<<0>>> 

Explanation: Since no valid α satisfies the given identity (as shown by the enumerated answers), the polynomial must be identically zero. Therefore, evaluating it at x=5 gives 0. This is the only consistent solution given the constraints.
