This problem appears to be from the 2017 AIME I competition, problem 13. The exact problem statement isn't provided, but based on the Lean theorem statement, it involves summing some function Q(m) from m=2 to 2017 and finding the result modulo 1000. Since we don't know Q(m), we'll assume it's a simple arithmetic function for demonstration purposes (like m^2). The actual problem likely involves more complex number theory.

Here's a Python program that would enumerate possible answers for a similar problem (using m^2 as a placeholder for Q(m)):

```python
def Q(m):
    # Placeholder function - replace with actual Q(m) from problem
    return m * m

def compute_sum(modulus):
    total = 0
    for m in range(2, 2018):
        total += Q(m)
    return total % modulus

# Compute the answer modulo 1000
answer = compute_sum(1000)
print(f"Sum from m=2 to 2017 of Q(m) modulo 1000: {answer}")
```

Note: For the actual problem, you would need to:
1. Replace Q(m) with the actual function from the problem
2. The range 2-2017 matches the theorem statement
3. The modulus 1000 is specified in the theorem

The program computes the sum and prints the result modulo 1000. Since we don't know the real Q(m), this is just a template. The actual problem likely involves more complex number theory concepts like Euler's totient function or MÃ¶bius function.

For a real implementation, you would need the exact definition of Q(m) from the problem statement. The Lean theorem suggests this was a competition problem with a known answer, but without the full context, we can only provide this template solution.
