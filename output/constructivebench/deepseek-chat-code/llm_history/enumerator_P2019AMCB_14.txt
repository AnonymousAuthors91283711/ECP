This problem asks for the number of distinct products d1*d2 where d1 and d2 are distinct positive divisors of 100000. We'll enumerate all divisors of 100000, compute all possible products of distinct pairs, count the unique ones, and output the count.

The prime factorization of 100000 is 2^5 * 5^5, so it has (5+1)*(5+1) = 36 divisors. We'll generate all divisors, compute all pairwise products, and count distinct values.

```python
def main():
    # Generate all divisors of 100000 (2^5 * 5^5)
    divisors = []
    for a in range(6):  # exponents of 2 (0..5)
        for b in range(6):  # exponents of 5 (0..5)
            divisors.append((2**a) * (5**b))
    
    # Compute all products of distinct pairs
    products = set()
    n = len(divisors)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            products.add(divisors[i] * divisors[j])
    
    # Output the count of distinct products
    print(len(products))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
