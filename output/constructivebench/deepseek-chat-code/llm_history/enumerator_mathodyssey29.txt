[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of non-zero integer pairs (a, b) that satisfy the equation (a³ + b)(a + b³) = (a + b)⁴. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such pairs within a reasonable range and count them.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible integer values of a and b within a symmetric range around zero
2. Skip cases where either a or b is zero
3. Check if the equation holds for each pair
4. Count and print valid pairs

We'll use a range of -100 to 100 which should be sufficient to find all solutions.

```python
def solve():
    count = 0
    # We'll search in a symmetric range around zero
    search_range = 100
    for a in range(-search_range, search_range + 1):
        if a == 0:
            continue
        for b in range(-search_range, search_range + 1):
            if b == 0:
                continue
            left = (a**3 + b) * (a + b**3)
            right = (a + b)**4
            if left == right:
                count += 1
                print(f"Found pair: ({a}, {b})")  # Print each solution
    print(f"Total number of solutions: {count}")

solve()
```
