This problem asks for the maximum possible sum of a 15-term arithmetic sequence where each term is ≤ 999, and the common difference d is maximal (no larger d works for any starting term). We'll enumerate possible d values and find the maximal sum.

The approach:
1. For each possible d, find the largest possible a such that a+14d ≤ 999
2. Calculate the sum of the 15-term sequence starting at a with difference d
3. Track the maximum sum found

```python
def arithmetic_sum(a, d, n):
    return n * (2 * a + (n - 1) * d) // 2

max_sum = 0
best_d = 0
best_a = 0

# We need a + 14d <= 999, so d can be at most floor(999/14) = 71
for d in range(71, 0, -1):
    a = 999 - 14 * d
    if a < 0:
        continue  # Skip invalid cases where a would be negative
    current_sum = arithmetic_sum(a, d, 15)
    if current_sum > max_sum:
        max_sum = current_sum
        best_d = d
        best_a = a
        print(f"New max sum: {max_sum} (a={a}, d={d})")

print(f"\nFinal answer: {max_sum}")
```
