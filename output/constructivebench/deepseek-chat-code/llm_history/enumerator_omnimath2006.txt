[write_program]
This problem involves finding the maximum number of pairs (n, n+1) in a permutation of 2012 elements where π(n) divides π(n+1). We'll write a Python program to explore this for smaller values to identify the pattern.

The approach:
1. Generate all permutations for small n (up to 6 due to computational constraints)
2. For each permutation, count the number of consecutive pairs where π[i] divides π[i+1]
3. Track the maximum count found for each n

```python
from itertools import permutations

def max_consecutive_dividing_pairs(n):
    max_count = 0
    # We'll use a sample of permutations for n>5 due to computational constraints
    perms = permutations(range(1, n+1)) if n <= 5 else permutations(range(1, n+1), 10000)
    for perm in perms:
        count = 0
        for i in range(n-1):
            if perm[i+1] % perm[i] == 0:
                count += 1
        if count > max_count:
            max_count = count
            print(f"n={n}: new max {max_count} found in {perm}")
    return max_count

for n in range(2, 7):
    print(f"\nTesting n={n}")
    result = max_consecutive_dividing_pairs(n)
    print(f"Maximum for n={n}: {result}")
```
