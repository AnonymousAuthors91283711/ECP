theorem olympiadbench3036
    (a r : ℝ)
    (hprod : a * (a * r) * (a * r ^ 2) * (a * r ^ 3) * (a * r ^ 4) = 32)
    (hforth : a * r ^ 3 = 17) :
    (a * r = olympiadbench3036_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for real solutions (a, r) satisfying:
a * (a*r) * (a*r^2) * (a*r^3) * (a*r^4) = 32
a * r^3 = 17

Found solutions:
Solution 1:
a = 8/289
r = 17/2
a*r = 4/17
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<4 / 17>>>
