[write_program]
This problem is a simple linear equation that can be solved algebraically. The task is to find the value of x that satisfies the equation 4*(x+4) = 24 + 3*(2x-2). We'll write a Python program that solves this equation symbolically and outputs the exact solution.

The program will:
1. Solve the equation algebraically
2. Output the exact solution as a fraction (since it's rational)
3. Also provide the decimal approximation for verification

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Solve the equation 4*(x+4) = 24 + 3*(2x-2)
# Expanding both sides:
# 4x + 16 = 24 + 6x - 6
# Simplify right side: 4x + 16 = 18 + 6x
# Bring all terms to one side: -2x = 2
# Solution: x = -1

# Exact solution as a fraction
x = Fraction(-1, 1)
print(f"Exact solution: x = {x}")

# Decimal approximation
print(f"Decimal approximation: x = {float(x)}")
```
