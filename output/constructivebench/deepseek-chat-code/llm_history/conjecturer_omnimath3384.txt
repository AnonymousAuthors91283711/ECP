abbrev omnimath3384_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3384 :
  IsLeast {m : ℕ | ∀ (s1 s2 s3 : ℕ), (m + s1 + s2 + s3) / 4 = 20 → s1 < 20 ∧ s2 < 20 ∧ s3 < 20} omnimath3384_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No valid m found in range. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the problem statement and the fact that no valid m was found in the enumerated range, the minimal m satisfying the condition must be when all s_i are maximized (19). Solving (m + 19*3)/4 = 20 gives m = 23.
