This problem involves solving an exponential equation and then evaluating another expression based on the solution. We'll approach it by:
1. Solving 9^x + 3^x = 6 for x
2. Using that solution to compute 16^(1/x) + 4^(1/x)

We'll use substitution to solve the equation, then compute the required expression. The program will:
1. Find real roots of the equation by substitution (let y = 3^x)
2. For each valid root, compute the desired expression

```python
import math

def solve():
    # Solve 9^x + 3^x = 6 by substitution y = 3^x
    # Equation becomes y^2 + y - 6 = 0
    # Find roots of quadratic equation
    a, b, c = 1, 1, -6
    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
    y1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
    y2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
    
    # Only y1 is positive (valid since y = 3^x > 0)
    y = y1
    x = math.log(y) / math.log(3)  # since 3^x = y
    
    # Compute 16^(1/x) + 4^(1/x)
    term1 = 16 ** (1/x)
    term2 = 4 ** (1/x)
    result = term1 + term2
    
    print(f"For x = {x}")
    print(f"16^(1/x) + 4^(1/x) = {result}")
