This problem involves finding all positive real numbers x in (0, π) that satisfy the trigonometric equation:
1 + sin(x)/sin(4x) = sin(3x)/sin(2x)
and then summing these solutions.

We'll approach this by:
1. Enumerating candidate solutions numerically within (0, π)
2. Checking the equation with a small tolerance
3. Collecting valid solutions
4. Summing them

Here's the Python program:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def find_solutions():
    solutions = []
    # Sample points densely in (0, pi)
    for x in np.linspace(0.01, math.pi-0.01, 10000):
        try:
            left = 1 + math.sin(x)/math.sin(4*x)
            right = math.sin(3*x)/math.sin(2*x)
            # Check equality with tolerance
            if abs(left - right) < 1e-6:
                solutions.append(x)
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            continue
    
    # Remove duplicates (due to numerical sampling)
    unique_solutions = []
    prev = -1
    for x in sorted(solutions):
        if abs(x - prev) > 1e-4:
            unique_solutions.append(x)
            print(f"Found solution: {x}")  # Stream partial results
            prev = x
    
    if unique_solutions:
        total = sum(unique_solutions)
        print(f"Sum of solutions: {total}")
    else:
        print("No solutions found")

find_solutions()
```

The program samples points in (0, π) and checks where the equation holds numerically. It prints each unique solution found and finally their sum. The tolerance values (1e-6 for equation check and 1e-4 for uniqueness) can be adjusted if needed.
