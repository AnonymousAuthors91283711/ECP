[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number `n` that is even and satisfies `7n â‰¡ 0 mod 52`. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal `n` by checking numbers in order until we find the first one meeting both conditions.

The approach:
1. Iterate through even numbers (since n must be divisible by 2)
2. For each even number, check if 7n is divisible by 52
3. The first number satisfying both conditions is our answer

```python
def find_min_n():
    n = 2  # start with first even number
    while True:
        if (7 * n) % 52 == 0:
            print(f"Found candidate: {n}")
            return n
        n += 2  # only check even numbers

min_n = find_min_n()
print(f"Minimum n satisfying the conditions: {min_n}")
```
