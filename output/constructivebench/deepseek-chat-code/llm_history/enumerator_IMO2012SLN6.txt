[write_program]
This problem is from IMO 2012 Shortlist N6, asking to find all positive integers x such that for all positive integers y and n, the expression (2^n * y + 1) divides (x^(2n) - 1). The solution is known to be x=1, but we'll write a program to verify this conjecture for small values.

The program will:
1. Test small values of x starting from 1
2. For each x, test various combinations of small y and n values
3. If any combination fails, discard that x
4. Output x values that pass all tests

```python
def is_solution(x, max_n=5, max_y=5):
    """Check if x satisfies the condition for various y and n."""
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        for y in range(1, max_y + 1):
            divisor = (2**n) * y + 1
            dividend = x**(2 * n) - 1
            if dividend % divisor != 0:
                return False
    return True

def find_solutions():
    """Find all x values up to 10 that satisfy the condition."""
    print("Testing x values (max_n=5, max_y=5):")
    solutions = []
    for x in range(1, 11):
        if is_solution(x):
            solutions.append(x)
            print(f"Found solution: x = {x}")
    
    if solutions:
        print("\nPossible solutions found:", solutions)
    else:
        print("No solutions found in tested range")

find_solutions()
```
