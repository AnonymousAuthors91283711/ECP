[write_program]
The problem appears to be a placeholder from Lean theorem proving (Mathlib) rather than a concrete high-school competition problem. Since no specific mathematical problem is given, I'll provide a generic Python enumerator template that could be adapted for various competition problems. This template demonstrates how to enumerate combinations and check properties, which is common in math competitions.

```python
def enumerate_combinations():
    """Template for enumerating combinations with certain properties."""
    # Example: Find all pairs (a,b) where a^2 + b^2 is a perfect square
    max_n = 20  # Sample parameter
    print(f"Enumerating Pythagorean triples up to {max_n}:")
    
    for a in range(1, max_n + 1):
        for b in range(a, max_n + 1):
            c_squared = a**2 + b**2
            c = int(c_squared ** 0.5)
            if c * c == c_squared:
                print(f"{a}^2 + {b}^2 = {c}^2")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_combinations()
```
