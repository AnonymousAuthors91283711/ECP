This problem involves finding all real numbers x such that f(f(f(x))) = 3, where f(x) = xÂ² - 2x. We'll approach this by solving the nested function composition step by step.

The strategy is:
1. First solve f(y) = 3 to find possible intermediate values
2. Then solve f(z) = y for each y found in step 1
3. Finally solve f(x) = z for each z found in step 2

We'll implement this recursive approach in Python, carefully handling each level of composition.

```python
def f(x):
    return x**2 - 2*x

def solve_fx_eq(target):
    # Solve f(x) = target, which is x^2 - 2x - target = 0
    discriminant = 4 + 4 * target
    if discriminant < 0:
        return []
    sqrt_discriminant = discriminant ** 0.5
    return [1 + sqrt_discriminant/2, 1 - sqrt_discriminant/2]

def find_solutions():
    # First level: f(y) = 3
    level1 = solve_fx_eq(3)
    print("First level solutions (f(y)=3):", level1)
    
    all_solutions = set()
    
    for y in level1:
        # Second level: f(z) = y
        level2 = solve_fx_eq(y)
        print(f"Second level solutions (f(z)={y}):", level2)
        
        for z in level2:
            # Third level: f(x) = z
            level3 = solve_fx_eq(z)
            print(f"Third level solutions (f(x)={z}):", level3)
            all_solutions.update(level3)
    
    print("\nAll real solutions to f(f(f(x))) = 3:")
    for sol in sorted(all_solutions):
        print(sol)

find_solutions()
```
