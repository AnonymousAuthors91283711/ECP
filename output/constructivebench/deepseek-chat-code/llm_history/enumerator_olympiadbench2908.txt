This problem involves simplifying logarithmic expressions with different bases. We'll write a Python program to compute the exact value of the expression \( \frac{2^{\log_{4}800}}{2^{\log_{16}64}} \) by converting all logarithms to base 2 and simplifying.

The key steps are:
1. Convert all logarithms to base 2 using the change of base formula
2. Simplify the exponents using logarithm properties
3. Compute the final value

We'll use Python's math module for exact calculations and print the result.

```python
import math

# Convert logarithms to base 2 and compute the expression
log4_800 = math.log2(800) / math.log2(4)
log16_64 = math.log2(64) / math.log2(16)
result = 2**log4_800 / 2**log16_64

# Print the exact value
print(result)
```
