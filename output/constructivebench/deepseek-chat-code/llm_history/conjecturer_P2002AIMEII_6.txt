Looking at the problem and the enumerated answers, we can see the series is converging to approximately 520.733. The proposed answer 1000 * (5/12 + 1/4 - 1/2 - 1/3) evaluates to 1000 * (5/12 + 3/12 - 6/12 - 4/12) = 1000 * (-2/12) = -166.666..., which is clearly incorrect.

The series appears to be a telescoping series of the form 1/((n+1)(n+5)) after factoring the denominator (n+3)^2-4 = (n+1)(n+5). Using partial fractions, this can be written as (1/4)(1/(n+1) - 1/(n+5)).

When summed, most terms cancel out, leaving only the first few and last few terms. Based on the pattern and the convergence value, the correct closed form should be:

<<<1000 * (25/48)>>>

Explanation:
1. The partial fraction decomposition gives us terms that telescope
2. The remaining terms after cancellation would be (1/4)(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 - 1/(n+2) - 1/(n+3) - 1/(n+4) - 1/(n+5))
3. As n approaches infinity, the negative terms vanish
4. The sum of the constant terms is (1/4)(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4) = (1/4)(25/12) = 25/48
5. Multiplying by 1000 gives approximately 520.833, which matches our enumerated convergence pattern (the small difference is due to finite n effects)[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the enumerated answers, we can see the partial sums are converging to approximately 520.733. The proposed answer 1000*(25/48) ≈ 520.833 is close but not exact. The problem involves a telescoping series where terms cancel out.

The denominator (n+3)² - 4 can be factored as (n+5)(n+1). Using partial fractions, 1/((n+5)(n+1)) = (1/4)(1/(n+1) - 1/(n+5)). When summed, most terms cancel out, leaving only a few terms at the boundaries.

The exact sum should be (1000/4)*(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 - 1/10003 - 1/10004 - 1/10005 - 1/10006). For large n, the last four terms become negligible, so the main contribution is (1000/4)*(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5) = 1000*(77/240).

<<<1000 * (77/240)>>>

This gives exactly 520.833..., matching the pattern better than the original proposal. The exact rational form avoids floating point errors and matches the telescoping series analysis. The error decreases as n increases, converging to this value.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Looking at the enumerated answers, we can see the partial sums are converging to approximately 520.733. The proposed answer 1000*(77/240) ≈ 320.833 is too low compared to the convergence value.

The denominator (n+3)²-4 can be factored as (n+5)(n+1). This suggests partial fraction decomposition might be useful. The pattern in the enumerated answers shows convergence to a value around 520.733, which is close to 1000*(5/9.6) ≈ 520.833.

After analyzing the series and partial fraction decomposition, the correct closed form appears to be 1000*(5/9.6) = 1000*(25/48). This gives approximately 520.833, which matches our convergence pattern better than the original proposal.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<1000 * (25/48)>>>

Explanation:
1. The series denominator (n+3)²-4 factors to (n+5)(n+1)
2. Using partial fractions, 1/((n+5)(n+1)) = (1/4)(1/(n+1) - 1/(n+5))
3. The sum telescopes to approximately 5/9.6 when n approaches infinity
4. Multiplying by 1000 gives 1000*(25/48) ≈ 520.833
5. This matches the convergence pattern seen in the enumerated answers better than the original 77/240 proposal[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
