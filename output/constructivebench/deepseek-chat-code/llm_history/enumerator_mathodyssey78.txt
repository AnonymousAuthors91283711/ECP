This problem defines a recursive sequence `a(n)` with base cases `a(0)=0`, `a(1)=1` and recursive rules:
- `a(2n) = a(n)`
- `a(2n+1) = a(n) + 1`

We need to compute `a(2024)`. The sequence is essentially counting the number of 1s in the binary representation of n (also known as the Hamming weight or population count).

Here's a Python program that computes this sequence and prints `a(2024)`:

```python
def a(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return a(n // 2)
    else:
        return a(n // 2) + 1

# Compute and print a(2024)
print(a(2024))
```
