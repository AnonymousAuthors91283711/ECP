Ground Truth Answer: 2014 / 2015
Proposed Answer: 2015 / 2016
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

The problem is asking for the greatest real number x in the set where:
1. x is between k and k+1 for some natural number k
2. floor(x)/x = 2015/2016

The ground truth answer suggests that when k=2014, x=2015, but this doesn't satisfy floor(x)/x = 2015/2016 since floor(2015)/2015 = 2015/2015 = 1 ≠ 2015/2016.

The proposed answer 2015/2016 would satisfy floor(x)/x = 2015/2016 when x is just below 2016 (since floor(x) would be 2015). This makes more sense mathematically.

The proposed answer is correct while the ground truth answer is incorrect.
