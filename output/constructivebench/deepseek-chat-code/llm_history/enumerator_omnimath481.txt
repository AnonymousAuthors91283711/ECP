[write_program]
This problem involves finding natural numbers L > 0 where the sum T(L) = floor(1³/9) + floor(2³/9) + ... + floor(L³/9) is a perfect square. We'll write a Python program to enumerate such L values up to a reasonable threshold.

The approach:
1. Compute T(L) incrementally for each L
2. Check if T(L) is a perfect square
3. Output valid L values as they're found

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    """Check if n is a perfect square."""
    root = math.isqrt(n)
    return root * root == n

def find_valid_L(max_L=1000):
    """Find all L > 0 where T(L) is a perfect square up to max_L."""
    T = 0
    for L in range(1, max_L + 1):
        term = (L ** 3) // 9
        T += term
        if is_perfect_square(T):
            print(f"Found valid L: {L}, T(L) = {T}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_valid_L()
```
