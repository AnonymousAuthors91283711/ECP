The problem involves solving for x, y, z given three equations:
1. x + y + z = 20
2. 2 + 7 + 6 + 10 + x = 25 (wins)
3. 15 + 9 + 12 + 8 + y = 44 (losses)
4. 3 + 4 + 2 + 2 + z = 11 (ties)

We can directly compute x, y, z from the last three equations and verify they satisfy the first equation. Here's a Python program that calculates and prints the solution:

```python
# Calculate x from wins equation: 2+7+6+10+x = 25
x = 25 - (2 + 7 + 6 + 10)
# Calculate y from losses equation: 15+9+12+8+y = 44
y = 44 - (15 + 9 + 12 + 8)
# Calculate z from ties equation: 3+4+2+2+z = 11
z = 11 - (3 + 4 + 2 + 2)

# Verify x + y + z = 20
if x + y + z == 20:
    print(f"Solution found: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")
else:
    print("No solution satisfies all equations")
```
