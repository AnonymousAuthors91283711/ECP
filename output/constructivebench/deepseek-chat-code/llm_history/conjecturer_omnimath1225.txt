abbrev omnimath1225_answer : ℕ × ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1225 :
  ∃ (r s : ℕ), Nat.Coprime r s ∧
  (r : ℝ) / s = (2 * (sqrt 2 + sqrt 10)) / (5 * sqrt (3 + sqrt 5)) ∧
  (r, s) = omnimath1225_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Computed value: 0.8000000000000002
Testing max denominator 100: r=4, s=5
Potential exact match found: 4/5
Coprime pair: 4, 5. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
