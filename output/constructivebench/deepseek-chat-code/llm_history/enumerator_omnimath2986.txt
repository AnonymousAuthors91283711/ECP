[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of integers `n` such that `sqrt(15) < n < sqrt(50)`. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all integers in this range and count them.

The approach is:
1. Calculate the exact bounds: sqrt(15) ≈ 3.872 and sqrt(50) ≈ 7.071
2. Find all integers n where 3.872 < n < 7.071
3. Count these integers

```python
import math

def count_integers_in_range():
    lower = math.sqrt(15)
    upper = math.sqrt(50)
    print(f"Range: sqrt(15) ≈ {lower:.3f}, sqrt(50) ≈ {upper:.3f}")
    
    # Find the smallest integer greater than lower
    start = math.floor(lower) + 1
    # Find the largest integer smaller than upper
    end = math.ceil(upper) - 1
    
    print(f"Integer candidates: from {start} to {end}")
    
    count = 0
    for n in range(start, end + 1):
        print(f"Found valid integer: {n}")
        count += 1
    
    print(f"Total count: {count}")
