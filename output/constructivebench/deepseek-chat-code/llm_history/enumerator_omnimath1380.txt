This problem involves solving for the product e*f given two equations:
1. e/f = 3/4 (ratio of e to f)
2. √(e² + f²) = 15 (magnitude of vector (e,f))

We'll solve this by:
1. Expressing e in terms of f using the first equation
2. Substituting into the second equation to find f
3. Calculating e from f
4. Computing the product e*f

```python
import math

def solve():
    # From e/f = 3/4, we get e = (3/4)f
    # Substitute into second equation: sqrt((9/16)f^2 + f^2) = 15
    # Simplify: sqrt((25/16)f^2) = 15 => (5/4)|f| = 15 => |f| = 12
    f_possible = [12, -12]
    
    for f in f_possible:
        e = (3/4) * f
        product = e * f
        print(f"e = {e}, f = {f}, e*f = {product}")

    # The problem asks for e*f, which is the same for both cases (108)
    # Since it's a theorem, we output the exact value
    print("\nFinal answer (exact): 108")
