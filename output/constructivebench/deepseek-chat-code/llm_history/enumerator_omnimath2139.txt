[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimum value of the expression `(x*y)^2 + (x+7)^2 + (2*y+7)^2` over real numbers x and y. We'll write a Python program to numerically search for the minimum by evaluating the function over a grid of (x,y) values.

The approach:
1. Define the function f(x,y) that computes the expression
2. Search over a reasonable range of x and y values with small steps
3. Track the minimum value found
4. Print intermediate results and finally the minimum found

```python
import math

def f(x, y):
    return (x*y)**2 + (x + 7)**2 + (2*y + 7)**2

# Search ranges and step sizes
x_start, x_end, x_step = -10.0, 10.0, 0.01
y_start, y_end, y_step = -10.0, 10.0, 0.01

min_val = float('inf')
min_xy = (0, 0)

# Search through grid points
y = y_start
while y <= y_end:
    x = x_start
    while x <= x_end:
        current = f(x, y)
        if current < min_val:
            min_val = current
            min_xy = (x, y)
            print(f"New minimum: {min_val:.6f} at (x,y)=({x:.3f},{y:.3f})")
        x += x_step
    y += y_step

print(f"\nFinal minimum found: {min_val:.6f}")
print(f"At point (x,y)=({min_xy[0]:.3f},{min_xy[1]:.3f})")
```
