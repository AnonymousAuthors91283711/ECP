This problem involves computing the product of terms (2^(2^k) + 1) for k from 0 to 9, simplifying it to a reduced fraction m/n, and finding m+n. The key observation is that these terms form a telescoping product that simplifies to (2^(2^10)-1 through the identity (x-1)‚àè(x^(2^k)+1) = x^(2^(k+1))-1.

Here's a Python program to compute this:

```python
def compute_product():
    # Compute the product (2^(2^0)+1)*(2^(2^1)+1)*...*(2^(2^9)+1)
    product = 1
    for k in range(10):
        term = (1 << (1 << k)) + 1  # 2^(2^k) + 1
        product *= term
    
    # The product equals (2^(2^10) - 1) / (2^(2^0) - 1) = (2^1024 - 1)/1
    # So m = 2^1024 - 1, n = 1, m+n = 2^1024
    m = (1 << 1024) - 1
    n = 1
    print(f"m = {m}")
    print(f"n = {n}")
    print(f"m + n = {m + n}")

compute_product()
```
