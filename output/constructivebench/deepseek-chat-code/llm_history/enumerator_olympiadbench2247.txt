[write_program]
This problem asks for the maximum value of a function z = f(x,y) where x ranges from 2 to 5 and y ranges from 10 to 20. The theorem states that the greatest value in this range is 13. We'll write a program to verify this by enumerating possible combinations of x and y.

Since the exact function f(x,y) isn't specified, we'll assume it's a simple arithmetic expression that could produce 13 as a maximum. We'll test common operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division combinations.

```python
def enumerate_possible_functions():
    # Sample x and y values within given ranges
    x_samples = [2, 3.5, 5]  # low, mid, high x
    y_samples = [10, 15, 20]  # low, mid, high y
    
    # Common arithmetic operations to test
    operations = [
        lambda x, y: x + y,
        lambda x, y: x - y,
        lambda x, y: y - x,
        lambda x, y: x * y,
        lambda x, y: x / y,
        lambda x, y: y / x,
        lambda x, y: x + y/2,
        lambda x, y: y - x/2,
        lambda x, y: (x + y)/2,
        lambda x, y: x * y / (x + y)
    ]
    
    max_z = -float('inf')
    
    for x in x_samples:
        for y in y_samples:
            for op in operations:
                z = op(x, y)
                print(f"x={x}, y={y}, op={op.__name__}, z={z}")
                if z > max_z:
                    max_z = z
    
    print(f"\nMaximum z value found: {max_z}")
