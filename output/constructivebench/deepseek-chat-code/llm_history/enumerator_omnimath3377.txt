This problem involves finding a polynomial `omnimath3377_answer` such that for all x not roots of P, Q(x²)/P(x) equals this polynomial evaluated at x. We'll enumerate possible candidates by:
1. Finding roots of P (which are -4, -2, 1, 3)
2. Constructing Q from squares of these roots
3. Computing Q(x²)/P(x) symbolically for non-root x
4. Simplifying to find the pattern

```python
from sympy import symbols, Poly, roots, prod

def solve_omnimath3377():
    X = symbols('X')
    # Define P as given in the problem
    P = Poly(X**4 + 2*X**3 - 13*X**2 - 14*X + 24, X)
    
    # Find roots of P and construct Q
    P_roots = roots(P)
    Q_factors = [(X - r**2) for r in P_roots.keys()]
    Q = prod(Q_factors).expand()
    
    # Compute Q(X²)/P(X) and simplify
    expr = (Q.subs(X, X**2) / P.as_expr()).simplify()
    
    # Print intermediate results
    print("P(X) =", P)
    print("Roots of P:", P_roots)
    print("Q(X) =", Q)
    print("Q(X²)/P(X) =", expr)
    
    # The simplified expression should be our answer polynomial
    answer_poly = Poly(expr, X)
    print("Answer polynomial:", answer_poly)
