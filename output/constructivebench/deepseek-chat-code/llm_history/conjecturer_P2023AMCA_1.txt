Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 7, which is at "P2023AMCA_1_answer :" in "abbrev P2023AMCA_1_answer : ℝ := 3/2 * (45 / 30) * 6", there is an error: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instDivInvMonoid', and it does not have executable code.

Looking at the problem statement and the enumerated answers, we can see the exact value should be 27. The current proposed answer is unnecessarily complex and causes compilation errors. The problem involves solving a simple linear equation system:

1. From the condition `18 * t + 12 * t = 45`, we get `30t = 45` ⇒ `t = 45/30 = 3/2`
2. Then `P2023AMCA_1_answer = 18 * t = 18 * (3/2) = 27`

The correct answer is simply the direct computation of 18 times the solution t=3/2. Here's the fixed version:

<<<27>>>
