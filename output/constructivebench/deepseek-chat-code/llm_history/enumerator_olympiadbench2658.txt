This problem involves finding a distance `d` traveled under two different speed scenarios. The first scenario is traveling at speed `s` for `T + 30` minutes, and the second scenario is traveling at speed `s + 1.5` for `T` minutes. The distance `d` must be the same in both cases. We'll solve for `d` in terms of `T` by setting up the equations and solving for `s` first.

We'll choose a sample value of `T = 60` minutes (1 hour) to demonstrate the solution. The program will compute `d` for this case.

```python
def calculate_distance(T):
    # Solve for s: s*(T + 30) = (s + 1.5)*T
    # => s*T + 30s = s*T + 1.5T
    # => 30s = 1.5T
    # => s = 1.5T / 30 = T/20
    s = T / 20.0
    # Now calculate d = s*(T + 30)
    d = s * (T + 30)
    return d

# Sample value
T = 60.0
print(f"For T = {T}:")
d = calculate_distance(T)
print(f"Distance d = {d}")

# General formula: d = (T/20)*(T + 30) = (T^2 + 30T)/20
```
