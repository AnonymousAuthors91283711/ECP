Final average area: 0.331924
Scaled result (×100): 33.19. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the enumerated answer showing an average area around 0.333 (which is 1/3) and scaled to 100, the most likely exact answer is 33. The problem appears to be calculating the expected area of the union of two randomly placed half-unit squares within a unit square, which would intuitively be around 1/3 of the total area.
