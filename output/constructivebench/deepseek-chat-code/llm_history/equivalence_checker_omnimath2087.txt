Ground Truth Answer: 7
Proposed Answer: 31
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number c such that:
   - There exist distinct natural numbers a, b, c (all different from each other)
   - 42 divides a, 72 divides b
   - The numbers satisfy triangle inequalities (a+b>c, a+c>b, b+c>a)

2. Ground truth answer is 7. Let's verify:
   - Possible pair: a=42 (divisible by 42), b=72 (divisible by 72)
   - Check triangle inequalities: 
     42+72=114>7, 42+7=49>72 (false), 72+7=79>42
   - Doesn't satisfy all inequalities, so we need to find other a,b
   - Next try: a=84, b=72
     84+72=156>7, 84+7=91>72, 72+7=79>84 - all satisfied
   - Thus 7 is indeed valid

3. Proposed answer is 31:
   - Let's check with a=42, b=72:
     42+72=114>31, 42+31=73>72, 72+31=103>42 - all satisfied
   - However, we need the smallest such c, and 7 works (as shown above)
   - 31 is a valid solution but not the smallest

The proposed answer (31) is a valid solution but not the smallest possible one, which should be 7. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
