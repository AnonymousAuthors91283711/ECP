[write_program]
The problem is to find the unique real number x that satisfies the equation (-1) * 2 * x * 4 = 24. We can solve this algebraically, but since the task is to write a Python program to enumerate possible answers, we'll approach it numerically by testing values around the expected solution.

The equation simplifies to -8x = 24, so x should be -3. We'll verify this by testing values around -3 with decreasing step sizes to demonstrate convergence to the solution.

```python
def find_solution():
    # Start with a reasonable range around the expected solution
    start = -5.0
    end = -1.0
    step = 0.1
    
    # We'll refine our search in multiple passes
    for _ in range(4):
        x = start
        while x <= end:
            # Calculate left side of equation
            lhs = (-1) * 2 * x * 4
            # Check if it equals 24 (with some tolerance for floating point)
            if abs(lhs - 24) < 1e-8:
                print(f"Found solution: x = {x}")
            x += step
        
        # Narrow down the search range and decrease step size
        start = max(start, -3.5)
        end = min(end, -2.5)
        step /= 10
