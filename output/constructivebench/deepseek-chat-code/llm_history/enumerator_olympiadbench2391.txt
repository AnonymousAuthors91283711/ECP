[write_program]
This problem involves finding natural numbers n where the quadratic expression n² - 10n + 70 equals the linear expression 5 + 10(n-1). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible solutions by testing values of n up to a reasonable threshold.

The approach:
1. Simplify both sides of the equation to standard form
2. Solve the resulting quadratic equation
3. Check which natural number solutions satisfy the original equation

```python
def solve_equation():
    # We'll test values up to n=20 since the quadratic grows rapidly
    max_n = 20
    solutions = []
    
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        left = n**2 - 10*n + 70
        right = 5 + 10*(n - 1)
        
        if left == right:
            solutions.append(n)
            print(f"Found solution: n = {n}")
    
    if solutions:
        print("All solutions found:", solutions)
    else:
        print(f"No solutions found for n ≤ {max_n}")

solve_equation()
```
