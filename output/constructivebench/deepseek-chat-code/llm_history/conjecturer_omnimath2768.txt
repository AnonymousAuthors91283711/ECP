abbrev omnimath2768_answer : ℤ × ℤ → ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath2768 (x y : ℤ) (hx : x = -2) (hy : y = -1) : 
    (3 * x + 2 * y) - (3 * x - 2 * y) = omnimath2768_answer (x, y) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: For x = -2, y = -1, the result is: -4
Simplified expression (4y) gives: -4. Expected Answer Type: ℤ × ℤ → ℤ
<<<fun (x, y) => 4 * y>>>
