[write_program]
This problem appears to be asking for the greatest natural number k such that k < a^8, where a is some real number (likely the golden ratio based on the problem number). Since the exact value of a isn't specified, I'll assume a is the golden ratio φ = (1 + √5)/2 ≈ 1.61803.

The program will calculate φ^8 and find the largest integer k where k < φ^8. We'll compute φ^8 exactly using its algebraic properties (φ^2 = φ + 1) and then find the integer part.

```python
import math

# Calculate golden ratio
phi = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2

# Compute phi^8 using the identity phi^2 = phi + 1
# phi^8 = (phi^2)^4 = (phi+1)^4
phi_squared = phi + 1
phi_4 = phi_squared * phi_squared
phi_8 = phi_4 * phi_4

# Find largest integer less than phi^8
max_k = int(phi_8 - 1) if phi_8.is_integer() else int(math.floor(phi_8))

print(f"Golden ratio φ: {phi}")
print(f"φ^8: {phi_8}")
print(f"Greatest integer k where k < φ^8: {max_k}")
```
