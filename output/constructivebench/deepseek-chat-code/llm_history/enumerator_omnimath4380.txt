This problem involves graph theory concepts (friendship graphs, chromatic numbers, and merging operations). The key is to find the minimal degree condition (number of friends) that guarantees the graph's chromatic number is at least 2021. We'll enumerate small cases to find a pattern.

```python
def main():
    # Test small cases to find a pattern between chromatic number and minimal degree
    for n in range(1, 10):  # chromatic number
        for d in range(1, 20):  # minimal degree
            # The conjecture is that minimal degree >= n implies chromatic number >= n
            # We'll print cases where this holds
            if d >= n:
                print(f"Chromatic number {n} requires minimal degree >= {d}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
