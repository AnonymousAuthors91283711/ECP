The problem asks to find all natural numbers k ≥ 2 such that for any distinct m,n in {1,...,k}, k does not divide n^(n-1) - m^(m-1). We need to enumerate possible k values and check this condition.

The approach is:
1. Iterate k from 2 upwards
2. For each k, check all pairs (m,n) with 1 ≤ m < n ≤ k
3. If any pair violates the condition, skip this k
4. Otherwise, print k as a candidate solution

We'll implement this in Python with optimizations:
- Precompute m^(m-1) mod k for all m
- Only check pairs where m ≠ n
- Stop early if any pair fails

```python
def is_solution(k):
    # Precompute m^(m-1) mod k for all 1 ≤ m ≤ k
    mods = [pow(m, m-1, k) for m in range(1, k+1)]
    
    # Check all distinct pairs
    for m in range(1, k+1):
        for n in range(m+1, k+1):
            if (mods[n-1] - mods[m-1]) % k == 0:
                return False
    return True

# Search up to a reasonable limit
max_k = 100
print(f"Searching for solutions up to k={max_k}:")
for k in range(2, max_k+1):
    if is_solution(k):
        print(k)
print("Search complete.")
```
