This problem is about finding natural numbers a and b such that:
1. a + b = 17402
2. 10 divides a (10 âˆ£ a)
3. b = a / 10
4. a - b equals some answer we need to find

We can translate this into Python by enumerating possible values of a that satisfy the conditions and computing the corresponding b and a-b.

```python
def solve():
    target_sum = 17402
    # a must be divisible by 10, so we can iterate in steps of 10
    for a in range(0, target_sum + 1, 10):
        b = a // 10
        if a + b == target_sum:
            difference = a - b
            print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, a-b={difference}")
            # Since we're looking for the specific difference that satisfies all conditions,
            # and there's only one solution, we can break after finding it
            break

solve()
```
