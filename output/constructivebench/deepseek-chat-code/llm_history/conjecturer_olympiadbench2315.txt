open Real

abbrev olympiadbench2315_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2315 (n : ℝ) (h₁ : 0 ≤ n) (h₂ : n ≤ 100) :
    (10 * (1 + n/100) * 75 * (1 - n/100)) * (15 * (1 + n/100) * 75 * (1 - n/100)) = 345600
    ↔ n = olympiadbench2315_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: At n=60, product=345600.0 (should be 345600)
The solution is n = 60. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<60>>>
