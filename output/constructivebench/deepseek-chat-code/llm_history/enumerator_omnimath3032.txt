[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of equations to find the value of x - y. The equations are:
1. 2 + x = x + y
2. x + y = y + 5

We can simplify these equations to find the values of x and y, then compute x - y. The Python program will solve these equations symbolically and output the result.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def solve_equations():
    x, y = symbols('x y')
    # First equation: 2 + x = x + y
    eq1 = Eq(2 + x, x + y)
    # Second equation: x + y = y + 5
    eq2 = Eq(x + y, y + 5)
    
    # Solve the system of equations
    solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))
    
    if solution:
        x_val, y_val = solution[x], solution[y]
        result = x_val - y_val
        print(f"Solution found: x = {x_val}, y = {y_val}")
        print(f"x - y = {result}")
    else:
        print("No solution found")
