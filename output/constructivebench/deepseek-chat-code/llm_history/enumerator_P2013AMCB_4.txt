This problem involves finding the constant value of the expression `2 * miles / (gas_ray + gas_tom)` where gas_ray = miles/40 and gas_tom = miles/10. The solution should be independent of the miles parameter. We'll compute this expression for several small values of miles to identify the pattern.

```python
def compute_constant(miles):
    gas_ray = miles // 40
    gas_tom = miles // 10
    if gas_ray + gas_tom == 0:
        return None  # avoid division by zero
    return (2 * miles) / (gas_ray + gas_tom)

# Test small values of miles that make denominators work
for miles in [40, 80, 120, 160, 200, 240, 280, 320]:
    result = compute_constant(miles)
    if result is not None:
        print(f"miles={miles}: {result}")

# After observing the pattern, we can confirm the constant is always 16
print("\nThe constant value is always:", 16)
```
