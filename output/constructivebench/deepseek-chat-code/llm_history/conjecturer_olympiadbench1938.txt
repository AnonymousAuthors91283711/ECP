∀ g : ℤ → ℤ, (∀ x y : ℤ, g (x - g y) = g (g x) - g y - 1) → g ∈ olympiadbench1938_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing constant functions:
Found constant solution: f(x) = -1

Testing linear functions:
Found linear solution: f(x) = 0x + -1
Found linear solution: f(x) = 1x + 1

Testing quadratic functions (unlikely to find solutions):

Conclusion: The only solutions found are constant f(x)=-1 and linear f(x)=x+1. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ → ℤ)
<<<{fun _ => -1, fun x => x + 1}>>>
