This problem involves finding four natural numbers (b, r, g, c) that satisfy several linear equations and sum to 280. The key is to express all variables in terms of one variable and solve the resulting equation. Here's a Python program that enumerates possible values for c (the answer) by checking the constraints:

```python
def solve_problem():
    # We'll iterate possible values of c since it's the answer we want
    # From the constraints: r = c/4, b = r/2 = c/8, g = 3c
    # All must be natural numbers, so c must be divisible by 8
    for c in range(8, 281, 8):  # c must be <= 280 since sum is 280
        r = c // 4
        b = r // 2
        g = 3 * c
        
        # Check if all are positive and sum to 280
        if b > 0 and r > 0 and g > 0 and (b + r + g + c) == 280:
            print(f"Found solution: b={b}, r={r}, g={g}, c={c}")
            # Since we're enumerating c in increasing order, the first solution is valid
            return
    
    print("No solution found")
