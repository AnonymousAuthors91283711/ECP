abbrev omnimath3582_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3582 (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
  (∀ x y, f (f y) + f (x - y) = f (x * f y - x)) ↔ f = omnimath3582_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 
Checking constant functions f(x) = c:
Found candidate: f(x) = 0
Checking linear functions f(x) = a*x + b:
Found candidate: f(x) = 0x + 0

Checking quadratic functions f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c:
Found candidate: f(x) = 0x^2 + 0x + 0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
From the enumerated answers and the functional equation, the only solution found was the zero function. The equation holds trivially for f(x) = 0 since all terms become zero. No other simple forms (constant, linear, quadratic) satisfy the equation except the zero function.
