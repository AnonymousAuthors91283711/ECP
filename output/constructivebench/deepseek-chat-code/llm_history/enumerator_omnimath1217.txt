This problem involves finding a functional equation solution f(x) that satisfies the given condition for all real x,y. To conjecture the form of f(x), we'll test polynomial forms since the equation involves polynomial terms. We'll start by testing quadratic forms f(x) = ax² + bx + c since higher degrees would create terms that can't be balanced.

```python
def check_coefficients(a, b, c):
    # Verify if f(x) = ax² + bx + c satisfies the functional equation
    # We'll substitute x=1,y=0 and x=0,y=1 to get equations for a,b,c
    # Equation 1: x=1,y=0
    eq1 = (a*1**2 + b*1 + c) + (a*(2*1+0)**2 + b*(2*1+0) + c) + 5*1*0
    eq1_rhs = (a*(3*1-0)**2 + b*(3*1-0) + c) + 2*1**2 + 1
    # Equation 2: x=0,y=1
    eq2 = (a*0**2 + b*0 + c) + (a*(2*0+1)**2 + b*(2*0+1) + c) + 5*0*1
    eq2_rhs = (a*(3*0-1)**2 + b*(3*0-1) + c) + 2*0**2 + 1
    
    return abs(eq1 - eq1_rhs) < 1e-9 and abs(eq2 - eq2_rhs) < 1e-9

# Test quadratic coefficients
found = False
for a in [0, 0.5, 1, -1, 2]:
    for b in [-1, 0, 1, 2]:
        for c in [-1, 0, 1, 2]:
            if check_coefficients(a, b, c):
                print(f"Found potential solution: f(x) = {a}x² + {b}x + {c}")
                # Compute f(10) for this solution
                f10 = a*10**2 + b*10 + c
                print(f"f(10) = {f10}")
                found = True
                break
        if found:
            break
    if found:
        break

if not found:
    print("No quadratic solution found")
