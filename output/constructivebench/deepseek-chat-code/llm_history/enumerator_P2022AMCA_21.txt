This problem asks for a polynomial divisor of X^2022 + X^1011 + 1. We'll search for divisors by testing cyclotomic polynomials (which often divide polynomials of this form) and other simple patterns. The program will test small exponents first to find potential patterns.

```python
def poly_divisible(n, k, m):
    """Check if X^n + X^k + 1 is divisible by X^m + X^l + 1 for some l < m"""
    # We'll test m values that divide n or k patterns
    max_m = min(100, n)  # reasonable upper bound
    for m in range(1, max_m + 1):
        if n % m != 0:
            continue
        for l in range(m):
            # Check if the roots of X^m + X^l + 1 are also roots of X^n + X^k + 1
            # A root w satisfies w^m + w^l + 1 = 0
            # Then w^n = (w^m)^(n/m) = (-w^l - 1)^(n/m)
            # We need w^n + w^k + 1 = 0
            # This is complex to check symbolically, so we'll use numerical approximation
            # with a small number of test points
            for _ in range(5):  # test 5 random complex points
                import cmath
                theta = cmath.pi * (2 * _ + 1) / 10  # avoid simple angles
                w = cmath.exp(1j * theta)
                lhs = w**m + w**l + 1
                if abs(lhs) > 1e-6:
                    continue  # not a root
                rhs = w**n + w**k + 1
                if abs(rhs) < 1e-6:
                    print(f"Potential divisor found: X^{m} + X^{l} + 1")
                    return
    print("No divisor found with m <=", max_m)
