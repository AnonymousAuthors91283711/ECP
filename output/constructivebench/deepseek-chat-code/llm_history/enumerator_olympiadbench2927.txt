[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive real number x where the floor of x divided by (x minus its floor) equals 35. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal x by:

1. Noting that for any x, we can write x = n + f where n is an integer and 0 < f < 1
2. The equation becomes n/f = 35 â†’ f = n/35
3. Since 0 < f < 1, n must be between 1 and 34 inclusive
4. We'll enumerate n from 1 to 34, compute x = n + n/35, and find the minimal x

```python
def main():
    T = 35  # Given parameter
    min_x = None
    
    for n in range(1, T):
        f = n / T
        x = n + f
        print(f"n={n}, x={x}")
        if min_x is None or x < min_x:
            min_x = x
    
    print(f"\nMinimal x: {min_x}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
