abbrev omnimath327_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath327 (n : ℕ) (hn : n = 1982) :
  IsLeast {k : ℕ | ∃ (G : SimpleGraph (Fin n)) (_ : DecidableRel G.Adj),
    (∀ (s : Finset (Fin n)), s.card = 4 → ∃ v ∈ s, ∀ w ∈ s, v ≠ w → G.Adj v w) ∧
    k = @Fintype.card {v : Fin n | ∀ w : Fin n, v ≠ w → G.Adj v w} 
      (Subtype.fintype (fun v => ∀ w, v ≠ w → G.Adj v w))}
    (omnimath327_answer n) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 
Testing n = 4
Found valid k = 1

Testing n = 5
Found valid k = 2

Testing n = 6
Found valid k = 3

Testing n = 7
Found valid k = 4

Testing n = 8
Found valid k = 5

Testing n = 9
Found valid k = 5

Testing n = 10
Found valid k = 6

Based on pattern, for n=1982 the minimal k is likely floor((n+2)/2)
For n=1982 this would be: 992
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun n : ℕ => (n + 2) / 2>>>
