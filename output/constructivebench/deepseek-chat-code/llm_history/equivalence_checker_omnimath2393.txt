Ground Truth Answer: 990
Proposed Answer: 264
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest value of the difference between the infimums of two quadratic functions (f and g) defined over all possible triples (a,b,c) of distinct integers from 1 to 11.

2. For f(x) = a(x-b)(x-c), the infimum occurs at x = (b+c)/2 (vertex of parabola). The infimum value is -a(c-b)²/4.

3. For g(x) = a(x-b)(x+c), the infimum occurs at x = (b-c)/2. The infimum value is -a(b+c)²/4.

4. The difference is: d = [-a(c-b)²/4] - [-a(b+c)²/4] = a[(b+c)² - (c-b)²]/4 = a(4bc)/4 = abc.

5. Therefore, we need to maximize abc where a,b,c are distinct integers from 1 to 11.

6. The maximum product of three distinct numbers in 1-11 is 9×10×11 = 990.

The ground truth answer (990) correctly follows this reasoning, while the proposed answer (264) is incorrect as it's not the maximum possible product of three distinct numbers in this range.
