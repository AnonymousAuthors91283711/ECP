[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer t such that there exists a sequence of t integers whose cubes sum to 2002^2002. To approach this, we'll:

1. Consider that cubes modulo 9 can only be 0, 1, or -1
2. Note that 2002 ≡ 4 mod 9, and 2002^2002 ≡ 4^2002 mod 9
3. Since 4^3 ≡ 1 mod 9, we can simplify the exponent modulo 3
4. The minimal t must satisfy certain congruence conditions

We'll write a program to find the smallest t where the sum of t cubes can equal 2002^2002 modulo 9.

```python
def main():
    # Calculate 2002^2002 mod 9
    # 2002 ≡ 4 mod 9
    # Since 4^3 ≡ 1 mod 9, we can reduce exponent mod 3
    exponent = 2002 % 3
    remainder = pow(4, exponent, 9)
    
    # Cubes mod 9 can only be 0, 1, or 8 (≡ -1)
    # We need to find minimal t where sum of t cubes ≡ remainder mod 9
    # The minimal t is the smallest number that can represent remainder using 0,1,-1 sums
    
    # Precompute possible minimal t for each remainder mod 9
    min_t = {
        0: 1,  # 0
        1: 1,   # 1
        2: 2,   # 1 + 1
        3: 3,   # 1 + 1 + 1
        4: 4,    # 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
        5: 5,    # 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 1 (or similar)
        6: 6,    # 8 + 8 + 8 + 1 + 1 + 1
        7: 7,    # 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 1
        8: 1      # 8
    }
    
    t = min_t[remainder]
    print(f"Minimal t: {t}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
