[write_program]
This problem involves counting certain constrained permutations and computing a probability ratio. We'll write a Python program to enumerate valid permutations for small values of k and compute the ratio.

The problem asks for the probability that a random permutation of [1, 3k+1] of length 3k+1 has no initial segment whose sum is divisible by 3. We'll:
1. Generate all permutations of length 3k+1 from numbers 1 to 3k+1
2. Count those where no initial segment sum is divisible by 3
3. Compute the ratio of valid permutations to total permutations

```python
from itertools import permutations

def compute_ratio(k):
    n = 3 * k + 1
    numbers = list(range(1, n+1))
    total = 0
    valid = 0
    
    for perm in permutations(numbers):
        total += 1
        valid_flag = True
        current_sum = 0
        for i, num in enumerate(perm):
            current_sum += num
            if current_sum % 3 == 0:
                valid_flag = False
                break
        if valid_flag:
            valid += 1
            print(f"Found valid permutation: {perm}")  # Stream partial results
    
    if total > 0:
        ratio = valid / total
        print(f"For k={k}, ratio={ratio}")
    else:
        print(f"No permutations found for k={k}")

# Compute for small values of k
for k in range(1, 4):  # k=1 to 3 since higher values become computationally expensive
    compute_ratio(k)
```
