[write_program]
This problem asks for all positive integer triples (x,y,z) satisfying two equations:
1. x² = 2(y + z)
2. x⁶ = y⁶ + z⁶ + 31(y² + z²)

We'll write a Python program to search for such triples by:
1. Iterating x from 1 upwards
2. For each x, compute y+z from the first equation
3. Enumerate possible y,z pairs that sum to this value
4. Check if they satisfy the second equation

```python
def find_triples(max_x=20):
    for x in range(1, max_x + 1):
        y_plus_z = (x * x) // 2
        if x * x != 2 * y_plus_z:
            continue  # y+z must be integer
        
        # Iterate possible y from 1 to y_plus_z-1
        for y in range(1, y_plus_z):
            z = y_plus_z - y
            if z <= 0:
                continue
            
            # Check second equation
            x6 = x ** 6
            y6 = y ** 6
            z6 = z ** 6
            y2 = y * y
            z2 = z * z
            rhs = y6 + z6 + 31 * (y2 + z2)
            
            if x6 == rhs:
                print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")

find_triples()
```
