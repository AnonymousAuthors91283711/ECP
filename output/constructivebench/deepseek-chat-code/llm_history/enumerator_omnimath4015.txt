[write_program]
This problem involves finding a polynomial P(x) such that for all real x, P(2x + α) ≤ (x^20 + x^19)P(x). We'll write a program to search for possible polynomial solutions by testing small degree polynomials and specific values of α.

The approach will:
1. Test small integer values for α (like 0, 1, -1)
2. For each α, test polynomials of increasing degree
3. Check the inequality at sample points to eliminate candidates
4. Output plausible candidates that satisfy the condition at test points

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.polynomial import Polynomial

def test_polynomial(P, alpha, test_points):
    """Test if P satisfies the condition at given test points."""
    for x in test_points:
        lhs = P(2*x + alpha)
        rhs = (x**20 + x**19) * P(x)
        if lhs > rhs + 1e-6:  # Small tolerance for floating point
            return False
    return True

def find_possible_polynomials(max_degree=5, alpha_values=[0, 1, -1]):
    test_points = np.linspace(-2, 2, 20)  # Test range
    
    for alpha in alpha_values:
        print(f"\nTesting α = {alpha}")
        
        for degree in range(max_degree + 1):
            # Generate all monic polynomials of current degree with small integer coefficients
            from itertools import product
            coeff_ranges = [range(-3, 4) for _ in range(degree)]
            
            for coeffs in product(*coeff_ranges):
                coeff_list = list(coeffs) + [1]  # Make monic
                P = Polynomial(coeff_list)
                
                if test_polynomial(P, alpha, test_points):
                    print(f"Possible candidate: P(x) = {P}, α = {alpha}")
                    
    print("\nNote: The zero polynomial trivially satisfies the condition.")
    print("For non-trivial solutions, higher degree polynomials may need to be considered.")
