abbrev omnimath3006_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3006 : 
  4^n = 64^2 ↔ n = omnimath3006_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing n=0: 4^0 = 1
Testing n=1: 4^1 = 4
Testing n=2: 4^2 = 16
Testing n=3: 4^3 = 64
Testing n=4: 4^4 = 256
Testing n=5: 4^5 = 1024
Testing n=6: 4^6 = 4096
Found solution: n = 6. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<6>>>
