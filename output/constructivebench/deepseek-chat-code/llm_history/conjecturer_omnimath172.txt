From the enumerated answers, we observe that all valid triples (a,b,c) are consecutive integers in some order (including cyclic permutations). The pattern suggests the solution set consists of all permutations of three consecutive integers. Here's the Lean expression:

Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ × ℤ)
From the enumerated answers, we can observe that all valid triples consist of three consecutive integers in some order (like (k, k+1, k+2) and its permutations). The error in the original Lean code comes from using set notation {a,b,c} which isn't properly defined for integers in this context.

Here's the corrected version using explicit permutations of consecutive integers:

<<<{ (a, b, c) : ℤ × ℤ × ℤ | ∃ k : ℤ, (a = k ∧ b = k + 1 ∧ c = k + 2) ∨ 
                            (a = k ∧ b = k + 2 ∧ c = k + 1) ∨
                            (a = k + 1 ∧ b = k ∧ c = k + 2) ∨
                            (a = k + 1 ∧ b = k + 2 ∧ c = k) ∨
                            (a = k + 2 ∧ b = k ∧ c = k + 1) ∨
                            (a = k + 2 ∧ b = k + 1 ∧ c = k) }>>>

Explanation:
1. The pattern shows all solutions are permutations of three consecutive integers
2. The original set notation caused type inference problems in Lean
3. The corrected version explicitly lists all 6 permutations of (k, k+1, k+2)
4. This matches all enumerated examples where N=1=2016^0
5. The form maintains the required Set (ℤ × ℤ × ℤ) type
