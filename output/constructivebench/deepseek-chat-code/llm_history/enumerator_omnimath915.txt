This problem involves counting the number of subsets S of natural numbers that satisfy a certain property P. The property P states that there exist numbers a < b < c where a and c are in S, but b is not in S. 

To approach this, we'll enumerate all possible subsets of a small finite set (like {1,2,3,4}) and count how many satisfy P. This will help us conjecture a pattern for the general answer.

```python
def satisfies_P(S):
    """Check if subset S satisfies the property P"""
    elements = sorted(S)
    n = max(S) if S else 0
    # Check all possible a < b < c triples
    for a in range(1, n+1):
        for b in range(a+1, n+1):
            for c in range(b+1, n+1):
                if a in S and b not in S and c in S:
                    return True
    return False

def count_subsets(n):
    """Count subsets of {1,...,n} satisfying P"""
    from itertools import combinations
    total = 0
    universe = set(range(1, n+1))
    for k in range(0, n+1):
        for subset in combinations(universe, k):
            if satisfies_P(subset):
                total += 1
                print(f"Found subset: {set(subset)}")  # Stream found subsets
    return total

# Test for small values of n
for n in range(1, 5):
    print(f"\nFor n = {n}:")
    count = count_subsets(n)
    print(f"Total subsets satisfying P for n={n}: {count}")
```
