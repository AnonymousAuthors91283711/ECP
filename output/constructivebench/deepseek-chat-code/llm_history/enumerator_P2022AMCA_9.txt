This problem involves solving a system of equations with natural numbers. We need to find values for t, l, and a that satisfy all given conditions, where t is the final answer. The equations represent:
1. Total children = t + l + a = 31
2. Answer yes to question 1 = t + a = 22
3. Answer yes to question 2 = a + l = 15
4. Answer yes to question 3 = t + l = 9

We'll enumerate possible values for t (from 0 to 9 since t + l = 9) and check the other conditions.

```python
def solve():
    total_children = 31
    q1_yes = 22
    q2_yes = 15
    q3_yes = 9
    
    # t can range from 0 to 9 since t + l = 9 and l >= 0
    for t in range(0, 10):
        l = q3_yes - t
        if l < 0:
            continue
        
        # From t + a = 22
        a = q1_yes - t
        if a < 0:
            continue
            
        # Check a + l = 15
        if a + l != q2_yes:
            continue
            
        # Check total children
        if t + l + a == total_children:
            print(f"Found solution: t={t}, l={l}, a={a}")
            return
            
    print("No solution found")

solve()
```
