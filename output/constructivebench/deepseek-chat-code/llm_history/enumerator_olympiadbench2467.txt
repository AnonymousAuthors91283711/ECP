This problem involves finding a unique pair of positive real numbers (a, b) that satisfy two exponential equations. We'll solve it numerically by:
1. Taking the ratio of the equations to eliminate 'a' and solve for 'b'
2. Then substitute back to find 'a'
3. Verify the solution satisfies both original equations

```python
import math

def solve_equations():
    # Equation 1: a * 3^b = 2.75
    # Equation 2: a * 6^b = 3.75
    # Take ratio of eq2/eq1 to eliminate a:
    # (6/3)^b = 3.75/2.75 => 2^b = 15/11
    # So b = log2(15/11)
    
    b = math.log(15/11, 2)
    a = 2.75 / (3 ** b)
    
    # Verify the solution
    eq1 = a * (3 ** b)
    eq2 = a * (6 ** b)
    
    print(f"Found solution: a = {a}, b = {b}")
    print(f"Verification: 3^b*a = {eq1} (should be 2.75)")
    print(f"Verification: 6^b*a = {eq2} (should be 3.75)")
