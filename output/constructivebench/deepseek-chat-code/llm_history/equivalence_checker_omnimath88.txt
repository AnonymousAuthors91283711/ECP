Ground Truth Answer: fun k n => n * (3 * k)
Proposed Answer: fun k n => if k ≤ n then k * (2 * n - 1) else n * (2 * k - 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number m such that there exists a function f from Fin m to subsets of Fin(2n) where:
   - Each f(i) has exactly 2 elements
   - For any subset of size k+1, there exists two distinct elements whose images under f are not disjoint

2. The ground truth answer is n * (3 * k)

3. The proposed answer is a piecewise function:
   - If k ≤ n: k * (2 * n - 1)
   - Else: n * (2 * k - 1)

Comparison:
- For k=1, n=1:
  - Ground truth: 1*3=3
  - Proposed: 1*(2-1)=1
  These are different (3 ≠ 1)

- For k=2, n=3:
  - Ground truth: 3*6=18
  - Proposed: 2*(6-1)=10 (since 2 ≤ 3)
  These are different (18 ≠ 10)

The answers give different results in multiple cases, so they are not equivalent.
