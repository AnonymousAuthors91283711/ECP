This problem asks for the cardinality of the set of integers x where the absolute value of 2x is less than or equal to 7π. We need to find all integer solutions to |2x| ≤ 7π, which simplifies to |x| ≤ 7π/2 ≈ 10.9956. The integers satisfying this are from -10 to 10 inclusive.

Here's a Python program that calculates and verifies this:

```python
import math

def count_solutions():
    # Calculate the right bound (7π/2)
    bound = 7 * math.pi / 2
    print(f"Bound: {bound}")
    
    # Find all integers x where |x| <= bound
    max_x = int(bound)
    solutions = list(range(-max_x, max_x + 1))
    
    # Verify each solution satisfies |2x| <= 7π
    for x in solutions:
        assert abs(2 * x) <= 7 * math.pi
    
    # Print the count of solutions
    print(f"Number of solutions: {len(solutions)}")
    return len(solutions)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    count_solutions()
```
