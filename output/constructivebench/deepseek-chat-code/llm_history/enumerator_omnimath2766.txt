[write_program]
This problem is about solving a simple equation to find the value of x that makes the average of 1, 3, and x equal to 3. The equation can be simplified algebraically to find the exact value of x. We'll write a Python program that verifies the solution by checking the equation.

```python
def check_solution(x):
    average = (1 + 3 + x) / 3
    return abs(average - 3) < 1e-10  # Account for floating point precision

# The equation (1 + 3 + x)/3 = 3 simplifies to 4 + x = 9, so x = 5
# We'll verify this by checking the equation
solution = 5.0
print(f"Checking x = {solution}: Equation holds? {check_solution(solution)}")

# For completeness, let's check some nearby values
for delta in [-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1]:
    x = solution + delta
    print(f"x = {x}: Equation holds? {check_solution(x)}")

# The exact solution is:
print(f"The exact solution is x = {int(solution)}")
```
