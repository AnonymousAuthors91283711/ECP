(r b : ℕ)
(h1 : r = b + 6)
(h2 : (r : ℚ) / b = 5 / 3)
: (r + b = omnimath2950_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found solution: r=15, b=9
r + b = 24. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<24>>> 

Explanation: From h2, cross-multiplying gives 3r = 5b. With h1 (r = b + 6), substituting gives 3(b+6) = 5b → b=9. Then r=15, so r+b=24. The answer is constant regardless of enumeration.
