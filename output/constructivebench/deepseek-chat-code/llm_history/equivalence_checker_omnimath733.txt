Ground Truth Answer: {1010309}
Proposed Answer: {n | (n + 1) % 210 = 0 ∧ (digits 10 n).sum = 2 * (digits 10 n).length ∧ (digits 10 n).length ≤ 12 ∧ ∀ (i : Fin (digits 10 n).length), Even i.val ↔ Even ((digits 10 n).get i)}

The proposed answer captures all the conditions from the problem statement (h1, h2, h3, h4) but doesn't explicitly include the ground truth value 1010309. The conditions are correctly translated into set-builder notation, but we can't verify if this set contains exactly the ground truth answer without more computation. The proposed answer is mathematically correct in terms of expressing the conditions, but we can't confirm it's exactly equivalent to the ground truth without knowing if 1010309 is the only solution.
