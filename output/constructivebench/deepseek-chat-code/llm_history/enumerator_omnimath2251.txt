[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of three equations with three real variables (x, y, z). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible solutions by iterating through possible values of x (since it appears in all equations) and solving for y and z accordingly.

The approach:
1. Iterate x through a reasonable range (we'll use -10 to 10 with small steps)
2. For each x, solve the system for y and z
3. Check if the solutions satisfy all three equations within a small tolerance
4. Print valid solutions as they're found

```python
def solve_system():
    # We'll use a small step size for better precision
    step = 0.001
    tolerance = 1e-6
    
    # Iterate x from -10 to 10 with small steps
    x = -10.0
    while x <= 10.0:
        # From x + y + z = 19, we get z = 19 - x - y
        # Substitute into first equation: x*y + (19-x-y) = 40 => x*y -x -y = 21
        # => y(x-1) = 21 + x => y = (21 + x)/(x - 1) when x != 1
        
        if abs(x - 1.0) > tolerance:
            y = (21 + x) / (x - 1)
            z = 19 - x - y
            
            # Check if all equations are satisfied
            eq1 = x*y + z
            eq2 = x*z + y
            eq3 = x + y + z
            
            if (abs(eq1 - 40) < tolerance and 
                abs(eq2 - 51) < tolerance and 
                abs(eq3 - 19) < tolerance):
                print(f"Solution found: x={x:.3f}, y={y:.3f}, z={z:.3f}")
        
        x += step

    solve_system()
