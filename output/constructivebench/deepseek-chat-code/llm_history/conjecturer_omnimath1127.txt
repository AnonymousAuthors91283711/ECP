Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern in the enumerated answers, we can observe that the count of even rectangles is symmetric and follows a quadratic pattern based on the coordinates. The total count appears to be the number of positions where either both coordinates are even or both are odd. For a 9×9 grid, this would be 4×4 (even×even) + 5×5 (odd×odd) = 16 + 25 = 41 positions.
