This problem asks for the maximum number of triples (words) in a set over an alphabet of size 16 where no two triples (a,b,c) and (d,e,f) satisfy a = f (first element of first triple equals third element of second triple). We'll model this as finding the maximum number of edges in a tripartite graph with constraints.

The solution involves finding the maximum number of triples (x,y,z) where for any two triples (a,b,c) and (d,e,f), a â‰  f. This is equivalent to the maximum number of edges in a tripartite graph where no edge's first vertex matches another edge's third vertex.

```python
def max_triples(n):
    # The maximum is achieved by having all possible triples where no two triples (a,b,c) and (d,e,f) have a=f
    # This can be modeled as n^3 minus the forbidden cases, but actually the maximum is n^2 * (n-1)
    # Because for each possible (y,z), we can choose any x except one particular value
    return n * n * (n - 1)

# Test for small values to see the pattern
for n in range(1, 6):
    print(f"Alphabet size {n}: max triples = {max_triples(n)}")

# For the actual problem with n=16
n = 16
print(f"\nFor alphabet size {n}, maximum triples = {max_triples(n)}")
```
