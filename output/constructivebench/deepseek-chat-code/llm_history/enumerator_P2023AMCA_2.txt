[write_program]
This problem involves solving a linear equation in rational numbers. We need to find the unique rational number w that satisfies the given equation. The equation can be simplified and solved algebraically, but we'll write a Python program to enumerate possible rational solutions with small denominators to help conjecture the answer.

The approach is:
1. Enumerate possible denominators up to a reasonable limit (say 100)
2. For each denominator, enumerate numerators in a range that keeps w within reasonable bounds
3. Check which w satisfies the equation
4. Output each valid solution found

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve_equation():
    # The equation: (1/3)*w + 7/2*(1/4) = (3/4)*w + 1/2*(1/4)
    # Simplify to: (1/3 - 3/4)w = (1/2 - 7/2)*(1/4)
    # Which becomes: (-5/12)w = -3/4
    # So w = (-3/4)/(-5/12) = (3/4)*(12/5) = 9/5
    # But we'll enumerate to find this
    
    max_denominator = 20  # Reasonable limit for enumeration
    for d in range(1, max_denominator + 1):
        for n in range(-100, 101):
            w = Fraction(n, d)
            left = Fraction(1,3)*w + Fraction(7,2)*Fraction(1,4)
            right = Fraction(3,4)*w + Fraction(1,2)*Fraction(1,4)
            if left == right:
                print(f"Found solution: w = {w}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_equation()
```
