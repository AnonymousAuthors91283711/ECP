[write_program]
This problem involves finding natural numbers k (0 < k < 202) where there exists a natural number n such that the sum of fractional parts of (i*n)/202 for i from 1 to k equals k/2. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible k values that satisfy this condition.

The approach:
1. For each k from 1 to 201, we'll test possible n values
2. For each n, we'll compute the sum of fractional parts and check if it equals k/2
3. We'll limit n to a reasonable range (up to 202) since the fractional parts repeat modulo 202

```python
def main():
    for k in range(1, 202):
        found = False
        for n in range(1, 203):  # Check up to 202 since modulo 202 repeats
            total = 0.0
            for i in range(1, k+1):
                val = (i * n) / 202
                total += val - int(val)
            # Check if sum equals k/2 with some tolerance for floating point
            if abs(total - k/2) < 1e-9:
                print(f"k = {k}, n = {n}")
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            print(f"k = {k}: no solution found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
