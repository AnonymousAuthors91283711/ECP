Ground Truth Answer: {1331, 1728}
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | ∃ k : ℤ, k > 0 ∧ k^3 = n ∧ n % 10 ≠ 0 ∧ ∃ m : ℤ, m^3 = n / 1000 ∧ n % 1000 = 0}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

The problem is asking for the set of natural numbers n where:
1. n is a perfect cube (k³ = n for some positive integer k)
2. n is not divisible by 10 (¬(10 ∣ n))
3. n/1000 is also a perfect cube (m³ = n/1000 for some integer m)

The ground truth answer gives two specific numbers: 1331 and 1728.

The proposed answer describes the set using conditions that are mostly equivalent to the problem statement:
1. k³ = n for positive k (perfect cube)
2. n % 10 ≠ 0 (not divisible by 10)
3. m³ = n/1000 (n/1000 is perfect cube)
4. n % 1000 = 0 (n divisible by 1000)

The key differences are:
1. The proposed answer adds n % 1000 = 0, which is actually implied by m³ = n/1000 since n must be divisible by 1000 to make n/1000 an integer (as m³ must be integer)
2. The ground truth gives specific numbers while the proposed answer gives a set description

The proposed answer correctly captures all conditions of the problem, and the additional n % 1000 = 0 condition is redundant but not incorrect. The two answers are equivalent in their meaning, just presented differently (specific numbers vs set description).
