This problem appears to be about finding a function value at T=5 that equals 1/25. Since we don't know the actual function, we'll enumerate simple polynomial functions that could satisfy f(5) = 1/25.

We'll test functions of the form f(T) = 1/T^n for small integer values of n, since 1/25 is 5^(-2). We'll also check other simple forms like linear combinations.

```python
def test_functions():
    # Test simple reciprocal powers
    for n in range(1, 6):
        value = 1 / (5 ** n)
        print(f"Testing f(T) = 1/T^{n}: f(5) = {value}")
        if abs(value - 1/25) < 1e-10:
            print(f"Exact match found with f(T) = 1/T^{n}")
    
    # Test linear combinations
    for a in range(-2, 3):
        for b in range(-2, 3):
            if a == 0 and b == 0:
                continue
            value = a/5 + b/25
            print(f"Testing f(T) = {a}/T + {b}/T^2: f(5) = {value}")
            if abs(value - 1/25) < 1e-10:
                print(f"Exact match found with f(T) = {a}/T + {b}/T^2")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Testing possible functions for f(5) = 1/25")
    test_functions()
    print("Most likely candidate is f(T) = 1/T^2")
```
