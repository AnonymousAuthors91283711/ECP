abbrev omnimath3111_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3111 :
  let S := {y : ℝ | ∃ (x z : ℝ), x + y = 7 ∧ x * z = -180 ∧ (x + y + z)^2 = 4}
  ∃ (y₁ y₂ : ℝ), S = {y₁, y₂} ∧ y₁ ≠ y₂ ∧ -(y₁ + y₂) = omnimath3111_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found y = -29.0
Found y = -13.0
Final answer: 42.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<42>>>
