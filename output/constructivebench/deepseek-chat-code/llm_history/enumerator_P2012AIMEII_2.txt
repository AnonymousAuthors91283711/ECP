This problem involves finding a common ratio `r` for two geometric sequences `a` and `b` such that `a_15 = b_11` and then evaluating `a_9` as the answer. We'll enumerate possible values of `r` that satisfy the condition and compute `a_9`.

The approach:
1. Set up the equation from `a_15 = b_11`: `27*r^14 = 99*r^10`
2. Solve for `r` (note râ‰ 0): `r^4 = 99/27 = 11/3`
3. Compute `a_9 = 27*r^8 = 27*(11/3)^2 = 27*121/9 = 363`

Here's the Python program to verify this:

```python
def solve():
    # From a_15 = b_11: 27*r^14 = 99*r^10 => r^4 = 11/3
    r_pow_4 = 11 / 3
    r_pow_8 = r_pow_4 ** 2
    a_9 = 27 * r_pow_8
    print(f"a_9 = {a_9} (exact value: 363)")

solve()
```

The program directly computes the exact value of `a_9` using the derived relationship between the sequences. The output confirms that `a_9 = 363` is indeed the correct answer.
