theorem omnimath2909 (n : ℕ) :
  IsLeast {u : ℕ | ∃ (a b c d e f g h : ℕ),
    [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, u] = [n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, n+5, n+6, n+7, n+8] ∧
    a + b + c = d + e + f ∧
    a + b + c = g + h + u ∧
    a + b + c = c + f + u ∧
    a + b + c = a + e + h}
  (omnimath2909_answer n) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=1, no solution found
n=2, no solution found
n=3, no solution found
n=4, no solution found
n=5, no solution found
n=6, no solution found
n=7, no solution found
n=8, no solution found
n=9, no solution found
n=10, no solution found. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Since the enumerated answers show no solutions exist for n ≤ 10, and the problem asks for the least u satisfying the constraints, the answer should indicate no solution exists. In Lean, this is typically represented using `0` or another sentinel value with a proof that no solution exists.
