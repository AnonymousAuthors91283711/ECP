[write_program]
This problem involves finding all real solutions (x, y) that satisfy both given equations (curve1 and curve2), then summing all distinct x-values. We'll write a Python program to find these solutions numerically.

Approach:
1. Solve curve1 for y in terms of x: y = x² - x - 4
2. Substitute into curve2 to get an equation in x only
3. Find roots of the resulting quartic equation
4. Verify solutions and sum distinct x-values

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.polynomial import Polynomial

def find_solutions():
    # Equation from substituting y from curve1 into curve2:
    # (x² - x - 4)² = (x² - x - 4) - 15x + 36
    # Expanded form: x⁴ - 2x³ - 6x² + 3x - 16 = 0
    coeffs = [1, -2, -6, 3, -16]
    p = Polynomial(coeffs)
    
    # Find all real roots
    roots = p.roots()
    real_roots = [root.real for root in roots if abs(root.imag) < 1e-10]
    
    # Verify each root and collect distinct x-values
    unique_x = set()
    for x in real_roots:
        y = x**2 - x - 4  # From curve1
        # Verify both equations
        if abs(y**2 - (y - 15*x + 36)) < 1e-8:  # Check curve2
            unique_x.add(round(x, 8))  # Round to handle numerical precision
    
    print("Found x values:", sorted(unique_x))
    print("Sum of x values:", sum(unique_x))
