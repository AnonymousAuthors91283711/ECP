[write_program]
This problem involves finding the minimum and maximum values of a symmetric function S(a,b,c,d,e) = (a+b)(b+c)(c+d)(d+e)(e+a) under the constraints that each variable is ≥ -1 and their sum is 5. We'll write a Python program to explore possible values by sampling different configurations.

The approach will:
1. Generate all possible combinations of 5 numbers that sum to 5, each ≥ -1
2. Calculate S for each combination
3. Track the minimum and maximum values found

Since exhaustive search is impractical, we'll use a sampling approach focusing on boundary cases (where variables are at their extremes) and symmetric cases.

```python
import itertools

def calculate_S(a, b, c, d, e):
    return (a + b) * (b + c) * (c + d) * (d + e) * (e + a)

def generate_candidates():
    # Generate boundary cases where variables are -1 or higher
    candidates = []
    
    # Case 1: All variables equal (symmetric case)
    candidates.append([1.0]*5)  # 1+1+1+1+1=5
    
    # Case 2: One variable is -1, others adjust to sum to 5
    for i in range(5):
        vals = [1.5]*5
        vals[i] = -1.0
        # Adjust to make sum exactly 5
        total = sum(vals)
        adjustment = (5 - total)/4
        for j in range(5):
            if j != i:
                vals[j] += adjustment
        candidates.append(vals)
    
    # Case 3: Two variables are -1
    for i,j in itertools.combinations(range(5), 2):
        vals = [7/3]*5
        vals[i] = vals[j] = -1.0
        # Adjust to make sum exactly 5
        total = sum(vals)
        adjustment = (5 - total)/3
        for k in range(5):
            if k != i and k != j:
                vals[k] += adjustment
        candidates.append(vals)
    
    return candidates

def main():
    min_S = float('inf')
    max_S = -float('inf')
    
    for candidate in generate_candidates():
        a, b, c, d, e = candidate
        S = calculate_S(a, b, c, d, e)
        print(f"For {candidate}: S = {S}")
        
        if S < min_S:
            min_S = S
        if S > max_S:
            max_S = S
    
    print(f"\nMinimum S found: {min_S}")
    print(f"Maximum S found: {max_S}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
