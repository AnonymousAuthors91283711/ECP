This problem involves summing an infinite series where each term is the floor of a certain expression involving square roots and powers of 4. To approach this computationally, we'll:

1. Recognize that terms become negligible as k increases (since 4^k grows exponentially)
2. Compute terms until they contribute 0 to the sum
3. Accumulate the floor values while printing intermediate results

The key observation is that for large enough k, (2000000/4^k) becomes small enough that the floor expression evaluates to 1 or 0.

```python
import math

def compute_term(k):
    denominator = 4 ** k
    if denominator == 0:
        return 0  # handle k=0 case properly
    sqrt_val = math.sqrt(2000000 / denominator)
    expression = (1 + sqrt_val) / 2
    return math.floor(expression)

def main():
    total = 0
    k = 0
    while True:
        term = compute_term(k)
        if term == 0:
            break  # no more contributions to sum
        total += term
        print(f"k={k}, term={term}, running_total={total}")
        k += 1
    
    print(f"Final sum: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
