[write_program]
This problem involves finding the number of quadruples (a,b,c,d) where a > b > c > d ≥ 0, a + b + c + d = 2010, and a² - b² + c² - d² = 2010. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values efficiently.

Key observations:
1. The second condition can be rewritten as (a-b)(a+b) + (c-d)(c+d) = 2010
2. Since a > b > c > d, all differences are positive
3. We can iterate through possible a values and find corresponding b,c,d that satisfy both equations

```python
def solve():
    total = 2010
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate possible a values (must be at least total/4)
    for a in range(total // 4 + 1, total):
        # Iterate possible b values (must be <a and > (total-a)/3)
        remaining_after_a = total - a
        for b in range(min(a-1, remaining_after_a), max(0, (remaining_after_a - 1) // 2 - 1), -1):
            # Iterate possible c values (must be <b and > (remaining_after_a-b)/2)
            remaining_after_b = remaining_after_a - b
            for c in range(min(b-1, remaining_after_b), max(0, (remaining_after_b - 1) // 1 - 1), -1):
                d = remaining_after_b - c
                if d >= c:
                    continue  # violates c > d
                # Check second condition
                if (a*a - b*b + c*c - d*d) == total:
                    count += 1
                    print(f"Found solution: ({a}, {b}, {c}, {d})")
    
    print(f"Total number of solutions: {count}")

solve()
```
