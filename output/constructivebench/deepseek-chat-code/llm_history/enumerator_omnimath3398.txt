[write_program]
This problem is about simplifying the rational expression 1/(2 + (2/3)). The task is to compute the exact simplified form. We'll write a Python program to compute this exact value using fractions.

The approach is:
1. Represent the denominator (2 + 2/3) as a fraction
2. Compute its reciprocal (1/denominator)
3. Simplify the resulting fraction

We'll use Python's fractions module to handle exact rational arithmetic.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_expression():
    # Compute 2 + (2/3) as a fraction
    denominator = Fraction(2) + Fraction(2, 3)
    # Compute reciprocal 1/denominator
    result = Fraction(1) / denominator
    return result

answer = compute_expression()
print(f"1/(2 + (2/3)) = {answer.numerator}/{answer.denominator}")
```
