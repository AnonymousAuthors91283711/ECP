[write_program]
This problem asks for the sum of two odd integers a and b where b = 3a and a < b. We need to find the smallest such sum (since it's a competition problem, likely asking for minimal solution). The program will enumerate possible odd integer values of a and compute b = 3a, then check the conditions.

```python
def find_min_sum():
    # Start with smallest odd integers and check conditions
    a = 1
    while True:
        if a % 2 == 1:  # a must be odd
            b = 3 * a
            if b % 2 == 1 and a < b:  # b must be odd and greater than a
                print(f"Found valid pair: a={a}, b={b}, sum={a+b}")
                # Since we're finding minimal sum, first valid is the answer
                print(f"Minimal sum found: {a+b}")
                return
        a += 2  # increment by 2 to stay odd

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_sum()
```
