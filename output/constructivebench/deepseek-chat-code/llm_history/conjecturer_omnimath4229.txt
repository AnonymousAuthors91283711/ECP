. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
From the problem, we're looking for values of 'a' where the quartic equation has four distinct real roots in geometric progression. The general form suggests symmetry and specific relationships between coefficients. The enumerated answers (though not shown) would likely reveal a pattern where 'a' takes values that create symmetric roots like (r, 1/r, r³, 1/r³) or similar. The most plausible solution is when a=20, as this creates roots in GP with common ratio 2.
