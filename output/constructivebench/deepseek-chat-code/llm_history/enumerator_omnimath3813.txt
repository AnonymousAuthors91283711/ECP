[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest integer b ≥ 2 such that there exists an integer a where for every k in [a+1, a+b], there's another distinct l in the same interval where gcd(k²+k+1, l²+l+1) > 1. We'll write a Python program to search for such pairs (a,b) with small b values.

The approach:
1. Iterate b from 2 upwards
2. For each b, search a in a reasonable range
3. For each (a,b) pair, check the gcd condition for all k in the interval
4. The first b that satisfies the condition is our answer

```python
import math

def find_min_b(max_b=20):
    for b in range(2, max_b + 1):
        # Search a in a reasonable range around b
        for a in range(0, 1000):
            interval = range(a + 1, a + b + 1)
            all_valid = True
            for k in interval:
                found = False
                for l in interval:
                    if l == k:
                        continue
                    val_k = k * k + k + 1
                    val_l = l * l + l + 1
                    if math.gcd(val_k, val_l) > 1:
                        found = True
                        break
                if not found:
                    all_valid = False
                    break
            if all_valid:
                print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}")
                return b
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    min_b = find_min_b()
    if min_b is not None:
        print(f"The minimal b is: {min_b}")
    else:
        print("No solution found in the search range")
```
