Ground Truth Answer: 15/64
Proposed Answer: 15 * (240 - 15) / (120 * 120)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the probability that two independent uniform random variables in [0,120] are within 15 units of each other.

2. The ground truth answer is 15/64.

3. The proposed answer is 15*(240-15)/(120*120).

Let's simplify the proposed answer:
15*(240-15)/(120*120) = 15*225/14400 = 3375/14400 = 15/64 (dividing numerator and denominator by 225)

The two answers are mathematically equivalent, just in different forms.
