[write_program]
This appears to be a simple arithmetic problem from Lean (a theorem prover) asking to compute the value of `2 + 3 * 5 + 2`. The answer can be computed directly following standard order of operations (multiplication before addition).

Here's a Python program that computes and prints the answer:

```python
# Compute 2 + 3 * 5 + 2 following standard order of operations
result = 2 + 3 * 5 + 2
print(result)
```

The program will output `19` since:
1. First compute 3 * 5 = 15
2. Then compute 2 + 15 + 2 = 19
