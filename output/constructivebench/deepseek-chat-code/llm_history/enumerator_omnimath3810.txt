[write_program]
This problem asks to find all pairs of natural numbers (x, y) that satisfy the equation x³y + x + y = xy + 2xy². We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible solutions by testing small natural numbers.

The approach:
1. Rewrite the equation as x³y - xy - 2xy² + x + y = 0
2. For each x starting from 1, compute the maximum possible y where terms remain positive
3. For each (x,y) pair, check if the equation holds
4. Stop when x reaches a reasonable threshold where y becomes negative

```python
def find_solutions():
    solutions = []
    max_x = 10  # Reasonable upper bound for x
    
    for x in range(1, max_x + 1):
        # Calculate maximum possible y for current x
        max_y = 10  # Initial guess
        # Find y where equation terms remain positive
        while True:
            lhs = x**3 * max_y + x + max_y
            rhs = x * max_y + 2 * x * max_y**2
            if lhs < rhs:
                max_y -= 1
                break
            max_y += 1
        
        # Check all y values up to max_y
        for y in range(1, max_y + 1):
            if x**3 * y + x + y == x * y + 2 * x * y**2:
                solutions.append((x, y))
                print(f"Found solution: ({x}, {y})")
    
    print("\nAll solutions found:")
    for sol in solutions:
        print(sol)

find_solutions()
```
