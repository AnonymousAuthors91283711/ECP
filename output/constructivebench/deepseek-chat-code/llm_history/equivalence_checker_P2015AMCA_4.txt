Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => if x > y then x / y else y / x
Proposed Answer: fun x y : ℝ => if x = 4 * y then 3/2 else 13/6
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem gives us the condition x + y = 5(x - y) with x,y > 0
2. Simplifying the condition: x + y = 5x - 5y → 6y = 4x → x = (3/2)y
3. The ground truth answer gives x/y when x > y (which is true here since 3/2 > 1) → (3/2)y/y = 3/2
4. The proposed answer gives 3/2 when x = 4y, but our condition gives x = (3/2)y, not 4y
5. The else case (13/6) doesn't match the ground truth's else case (y/x)

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It checks for x=4y instead of x=(3/2)y
- The else case doesn't match the ground truth's logic
- It doesn't properly handle the x>y vs y>x cases

<<<False>>>
