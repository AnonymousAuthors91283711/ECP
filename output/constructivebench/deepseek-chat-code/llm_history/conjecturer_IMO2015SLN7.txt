abbrev IMO2015SLN7_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem IMO2015SLN7 (k : ℕ) :
  (∃ f : ℕ → ℕ, ∀ m n, m ≠ n → Nat.gcd (f m + n) (f n + m) ≤ k) ↔ k ∈ IMO2015SLN7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found working k=5 with f(n)=0n+0
Found working k=6 with f(n)=0n+0
Found working k=7 with f(n)=0n+0
Found working k=8 with f(n)=0n+0
Found working k=9 with f(n)=0n+0
Found working k=10 with f(n)=0n+0
Possible k values found: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{k | k ≥ 5}>>>
