theorem omnimath667 :
  ∃ (s : Finset ℕ), s.card = 5 ∧ s ⊆ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} ∧
  (∃ (t : Finset ℕ), t.card = 5 ∧ t ⊆ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} ∧
    s.prod id = t.prod id ∧ Even (s.sum id) ≠ Even (t.sum id)) ∧
  s.prod id = omnimath667_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found candidate product 420 with both parities
