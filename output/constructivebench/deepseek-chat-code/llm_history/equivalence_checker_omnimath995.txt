Ground Truth Answer: {p : ℕ | p = 2 ∨ p ≡ 3 [MOD 4]}
Proposed Answer: {p : ℕ | Nat.Prime p ∧ p % 4 = 3}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but incomplete. The ground truth answer includes both p=2 and primes p ≡ 3 mod 4, while the proposed answer only includes primes p ≡ 3 mod 4. The case p=2 is missing from the proposed answer, making it incomplete but mostly correct for the other primes.
