[write_program]
This problem is about finding the minimal possible value of the sum of absolute deviations between integer allocations N_i and given positive real numbers C_i (summing to 100), where the N_i also sum to 100. We'll write a program to explore small cases and look for patterns.

The approach:
1. For small dimensions (n=2,3), enumerate all possible integer partitions of 100 into n parts
2. For each partition, compute the sum of absolute deviations from given C_i values
3. Track the minimal sum found

```python
import itertools
import math

def main():
    # Test cases with small n and simple C_i values
    test_cases = [
        ([60.0, 40.0], 2),  # n=2 case
        ([40.0, 30.0, 30.0], 3),  # n=3 case
        ([25.0, 25.0, 25.0, 25.0], 4)  # n=4 case
    ]
    
    for C, n in test_cases:
        print(f"\nTesting case with n={n}, C={C}")
        min_sum = float('inf')
        best_N = None
        
        # Generate all integer partitions of 100 into n parts
        for N in itertools.product(*[range(101) for _ in range(n)]):
            if sum(N) != 100:
                continue
                
            current_sum = sum(abs(N[i] - C[i]) for i in range(n))
            
            if current_sum < min_sum:
                min_sum = current_sum
                best_N = N
                print(f"New best: N={N}, sum={current_sum}")
        
        print(f"Final minimal sum for n={n}: {min_sum} with N={best_N}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
