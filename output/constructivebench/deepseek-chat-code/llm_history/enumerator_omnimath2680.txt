[write_program]
The problem asks for the number of integer pairs (x, y) in the rectangle [-9,6] Ã— [-2,8] that satisfy the equation (y+2)(6-x) = (8-y)(x+9). We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such pairs.

Approach:
1. Iterate through all integer x values from -9 to 6 (inclusive)
2. For each x, iterate through all integer y values from -2 to 8 (inclusive)
3. Check if the pair (x,y) satisfies the equation
4. Count and print all valid pairs

```python
def solve():
    count = 0
    for x in range(-9, 7):  # x from -9 to 6 inclusive
        for y in range(-2, 9):  # y from -2 to 8 inclusive
            left = (y + 2) * (6 - x)
            right = (8 - y) * (x + 9)
            if left == right:
                count += 1
                print(f"Found pair: ({x}, {y})")  # Print each valid pair
    print(f"Total count: {count}")  # Print the final count

solve()
```
