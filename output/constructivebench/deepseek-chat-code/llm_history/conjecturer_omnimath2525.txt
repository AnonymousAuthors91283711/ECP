      omnimath2525_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 
Testing n = 1
Found valid sequence: [1], sum: 1
Found valid sequence: [2], sum: 2
Found valid sequence: [3], sum: 3
Found valid sequence: [4], sum: 4
Minimal sum for n=1: 1

Testing n = 2. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated answers, we observe that for n=1, the minimal sum is 1. The problem involves finding a minimal sum where each element in the sequence satisfies a recurrence relation involving absolute differences. The pattern suggests the minimal sum is simply n (the number of elements).
