The problem asks to find the smallest natural number n ≤ 22 such that n*6 + (22-n)*0 + 3*1.5 ≥ 100. We can simplify this to n*6 + 4.5 ≥ 100 → n*6 ≥ 95.5 → n ≥ 95.5/6 ≈ 15.9167. Since n must be an integer, the smallest such n is 16.

Here's a Python program that enumerates possible values of n from 0 to 22 and checks the condition:

```python
def main():
    for n in range(0, 23):
        total = n * 6 + (22 - n) * 0 + 3 * 1.5
        if total >= 100:
            print(f"n = {n} satisfies the condition with total = {total}")
            break  # Since we're looking for the smallest n, we can stop after first match

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
