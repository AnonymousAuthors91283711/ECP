The problem asks to count the number of functions f from a 7-element set to itself such that f(f(x)) is a constant function (i.e., fâˆ˜f maps every element to the same constant c). We need to compute this count modulo 1000.

We'll enumerate all possible functions on a small set first (n=3) to understand the pattern, then compute for n=7. The key observations are:
1. The constant c must be a fixed point of f (f(c)=c)
2. All other elements must map to c either directly or through one intermediate step

Here's the Python program to compute this:

```python
def count_special_functions(n):
    # Count functions where f(f(x)) is constant for a set of size n
    from math import comb
    
    total = 0
    # Iterate over possible constant values c
    for c in range(n):
        # Case 1: f(x) = c for all x (all map directly to c)
        case1 = 1
        
        # Case 2: Some elements map to c, others map to those elements
        # We can have k elements that map to something other than c (but must map to c via f)
        case2 = 0
        for k in range(1, n):  # number of non-c elements not directly mapping to c
            # Choose k elements that will map to other elements
            ways_choose = comb(n-1, k)
            # Each of these k elements can map to any of the (n-1-k) elements that map directly to c
            ways_map = (n-1-k) ** k
            case2 += ways_choose * ways_map
        
        total += case1 + case2
    
    return total

# First show small cases to verify the pattern
for n in range(1, 5):
    print(f"n={n}: {count_special_functions(n)}")

# Compute for n=7 and mod 1000
n = 7
result = count_special_functions(n) % 1000
print(f"\nFor n=7, result mod 1000: {result}")
```
