This problem involves finding the value of f(9) given a functional equation f(2x+3) = 2f(x)+3 and an initial condition f(0)=6. We'll write a program to explore the pattern by computing successive values.

The approach is to:
1. Start with the known value f(0)=6
2. Use the functional equation to compute f at other points
3. Look for a pattern that might help us compute f(9)

```python
def compute_f(x, memo=None):
    if memo is None:
        memo = {0: 6}
    if x in memo:
        return memo[x]
    
    # Solve for x in terms of smaller values using the functional equation
    # f(x) = 2*f((x-3)/2) + 3
    prev_x = (x - 3) / 2
    if prev_x in memo:
        memo[x] = 2 * memo[prev_x] + 3
    else:
        memo[x] = 2 * compute_f(prev_x, memo) + 3
    return memo[x]

# Compute f(9) and print intermediate values
target = 9
memo = {0: 6}
print(f"f(0) = {memo[0]}")
current = 0

# Compute values until we reach the target
while current < target:
    # Find next computable value (smallest x not in memo where (x-3)/2 is in memo)
    next_x = None
    for x in [2*k + 3 for k in memo.keys() if (2*k + 3) not in memo]:
        if x > current and (next_x is None or x < next_x):
            next_x = x
    if next_x is None:
        break
    
    memo[next_x] = 2 * memo[(next_x - 3)/2] + 3
    print(f"f({next_x}) = {memo[next_x]}")
    current = next_x

# Final answer
if target in memo:
    print(f"\nf({target}) = {memo[target]}")
else:
    print(f"\nCould not compute f({target}) directly")
    # Try to compute it via the functional equation
    try:
        result = compute_f(target)
        print(f"Computed f({target}) = {result}")
    except:
        print("Unable to compute the target value")
```
