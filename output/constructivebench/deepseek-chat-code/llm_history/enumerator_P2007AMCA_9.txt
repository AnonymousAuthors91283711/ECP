The problem is asking to find a real number d that satisfies two equations: 4.5 * 70 = d and d / 60 = P2007AMCA_9_answer. Essentially, we need to compute d first, then compute P2007AMCA_9_answer from d.

Here's a Python program that calculates and prints these values:

```python
# Calculate d = 4.5 * 70
d = 4.5 * 70
print(f"d = {d}")

# Calculate the answer = d / 60
answer = d / 60
print(f"answer = {answer}")

# The exact value is 315/60 which simplifies to 21/4
exact_answer = 21/4
print(f"exact answer = {exact_answer}")
```
