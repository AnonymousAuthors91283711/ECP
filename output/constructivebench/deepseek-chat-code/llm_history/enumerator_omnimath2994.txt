This problem involves finding Natalie's score given:
1. Jiayin's score is fixed at 161
2. The average of Natalie, Harpreet and Jiayin's scores is 171

We can solve this algebraically:
(n + h + 161)/3 = 171 â‡’ n + h = 171*3 - 161 = 513 - 161 = 352

Since we need to find Natalie's score (n), but there's no unique solution (any n and h that sum to 352 would work), the problem appears to be missing a constraint. However, since it's presented as having a unique answer, I'll write a program to enumerate possible integer scores for Natalie (assuming integer scores are expected).

```python
def enumerate_scores():
    jiayin = 161
    target_avg = 171
    total = target_avg * 3
    sum_nh = total - jiayin  # n + h = 352
    
    print("Possible integer scores for Natalie (n) and Harpreet (h) that sum to 352:")
    # Enumerate possible n values from 0 to 352
    for n in range(0, 353):
        h = 352 - n
        print(f"n = {n}, h = {h}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_scores()
```
