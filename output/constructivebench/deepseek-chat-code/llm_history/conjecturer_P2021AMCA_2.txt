Checking special cases with a=0 or b=0:
Found solution: (0, 0.5)
Found solution: (0.5, 0)
Found solution: (0, 1.5)
Found solution: (1.5, 0)
Found solution: (0, 2.5)
Found solution: (2.5, 0). Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → Prop
From the enumerated answers, we observe that the equation holds when either a=0 or b=0. The pattern suggests the solution is when at least one of the variables is zero. The general form would be when a=0 ∨ b=0.
