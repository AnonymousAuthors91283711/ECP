This problem involves finding all positive real-valued functions f defined on the positive reals that satisfy a given functional equation. We'll write a Python program to search for potential solutions by testing simple function forms like linear functions.

The functional equation is: f(x*f(x+y)) = y*f(x) + 1 for all x,y > 0.

We'll test linear functions of the form f(x) = a/x + b since the equation suggests an inverse relationship. We'll solve for coefficients a and b that satisfy the equation for sample x,y values.

```python
def test_linear_solution():
    # Try f(x) = a/x + b form
    from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve
    
    a, b, x, y = symbols('a b x y', real=True, positive=True)
    
    # Define the functional equation
    lhs = a/(x*(a/(x+y) + b)) + b
    rhs = y*(a/x + b) + 1
    
    # Simplify the equation
    equation = Eq(lhs, rhs)
    
    # Solve for coefficients a and b
    solutions = solve(equation, (a, b))
    
    # Filter valid solutions where a and b are positive
    valid_solutions = [sol for sol in solutions if all(t > 0 for t in sol)]
    
    # Print potential solutions
    for sol in valid_solutions:
        a_val, b_val = sol
        print(f"Found potential solution: f(x) = {a_val}/x + {b_val}")
        
        # Verify the solution by plugging in sample values
        x_test, y_test = 1.0, 2.0
        lhs_val = a_val/(x_test*(a_val/(x_test + y_test) + b_val) + b_val
        rhs_val = y_test*(a_val/x_test + b_val) + 1
        print(f"Verification for x={x_test}, y={y_test}:")
        print(f"LHS = {lhs_val}, RHS = {rhs_val}")
        print(f"Difference = {abs(lhs_val - rhs_val)}")
        print()

Judgement:
The original program has several issues:
1. It contains a syntax error (missing closing parenthesis in `lhs_val` calculation)
2. It doesn't properly handle the functional equation solution
3. The verification step is incorrectly implemented
4. The output format doesn't match the requirements (no streaming of partial results)
5. The program doesn't find any valid solutions due to implementation errors

The program should be rejected because it fails to produce any meaningful output and contains implementation errors. A corrected version should properly solve the functional equation and output valid solutions.

<<<False>>>

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, simplify

def find_solutions():
    # Define symbols
    a, b, x, y = symbols('a b x y', real=True, positive=True)
    
    # Define the functional equation
    f = lambda x: a/x + b
    lhs = f(x * f(x + y))
    rhs = y * f(x) + 1
    
    # Create and simplify equation
    equation = Eq(lhs, rhs)
    simplified = simplify(equation)
    
    # Solve for coefficients
    solutions = solve(simplified, (a, b))
    
    # Filter and verify solutions
    for sol in solutions:
        a_val, b_val = sol
        if a_val > 0 and b_val > 0:
            print(f"Potential solution found: f(x) = {a_val}/x + {b_val}")
            
            # Quick verification
            x_test, y_test = 1.0, 1.0
            f_test = lambda x: float(a_val)/x + float(b_val)
            lhs_val = f_test(x_test * f_test(x_test + y_test))
            rhs_val = y_test * f_test(x_test) + 1
            if abs(lhs_val - rhs_val) < 1e-6:
                print(f"Verified solution: f(x) = {a_val}/x + {b_val}")
                return
            
    print("No valid solutions found")

[refine_program]
Let me analyze this problem and the provided program:

Judgement:
1. The problem is a functional equation asking to find all positive real-valued functions f: ℝ⁺ → ℝ⁺ satisfying f(x*f(x+y)) = y*f(x) + 1 for all x,y > 0.
2. The program attempts to find solutions of the form f(x) = a/x + b using sympy.
3. The program fails to find any solutions (outputs empty result) because:
   - It doesn't properly handle the functional equation - the simplification and solving steps are incomplete
   - The verification test is too narrow (only tests x=1,y=1)
   - It returns after first potential solution without checking others

The program should be rejected because:
1. It doesn't find the correct solution (which should be f(x) = 1/x)
2. The verification is insufficient
3. The approach needs refinement to properly solve the functional equation

<<<False>>>

Here's a corrected version that properly solves the functional equation:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, simplify

def solve_functional_equation():
    x, y, a = symbols('x y a', real=True, positive=True)
    
    # Assume solution of form f(x) = a/x
    f = lambda x: a/x
    
    # Substitute into the equation
    lhs = f(x * f(x + y))
    rhs = y * f(x) + 1
    
    # Simplify and solve
    equation = Eq(lhs, rhs)
    simplified = simplify(equation)
    solutions = solve(simplified, a)
    
    # Verify solutions
    for sol in solutions:
        if sol > 0:
            print(f"Solution found: f(x) = {sol}/x")
            # Additional verification
            f_sol = lambda x: sol/x
            test_cases = [(1,1), (2,3), (0.5,0.5)]
            valid = True
            for x_test, y_test in test_cases:
                lhs_val = f_sol(x_test * f_sol(x_test + y_test))
                rhs_val = y_test * f_sol(x_test) + 1
                if abs(lhs_val - rhs_val) > 1e-6:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                print
