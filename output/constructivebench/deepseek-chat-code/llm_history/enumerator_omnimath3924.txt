[write_program]
This problem involves finding the minimal positive real number C such that there exists a sequence in [0,C] satisfying an expansive condition. We'll write a Python program to search for such C by testing candidate sequences and checking the condition.

The approach will:
1. Test small rational values of C
2. For each C, generate candidate sequences and check the expansive condition
3. Print valid C values as they're found

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def is_expansive(sequence):
    """Check if sequence satisfies the expansive condition |a_i - a_j| >= 1/j for all i < j"""
    n = len(sequence)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if abs(sequence[i] - sequence[j]) < 1/(j+1):  # j+1 since Python is 0-indexed
                return False
    return True

def test_candidate_sequences(C, max_length=5):
    """Test sequences of length up to max_length in [0,C] with denominator up to 10"""
    denominator = 10
    C_frac = Fraction(C).limit_denominator(denominator)
    
    # Generate all possible sequences with values k/d where 0 <= k <= C*d
    for length in range(2, max_length+1):
        max_k = int(C_frac * denominator)
        from itertools import product
        for seq in product(range(0, max_k+1), repeat=length):
            sequence = [Fraction(k, denominator) for k in seq]
            if is_expansive(sequence):
                print(f"Found valid sequence for C={float(C)}: {[float(x) for x in sequence]}")
                return True
    return False

def find_minimal_C():
    """Search for minimal C by testing increasing values"""
    # Test C values starting from 1 upwards with small increments
    min_found = None
    for numerator in range(10, 30):
        C = Fraction(numerator, 10)
        if test_candidate_sequences(C):
            if min_found is None or C < min_found:
                min_found = C
                print(f"New minimal C found: {float(C)}")
    
    if min_found:
        print(f"\nFinal minimal C found: {float(min_found)}")
    else:
        print("No suitable C found in tested range")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_minimal_C()
```
