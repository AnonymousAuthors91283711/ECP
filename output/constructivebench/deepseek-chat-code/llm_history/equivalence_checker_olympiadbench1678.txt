theorem olympiadbench1678 (k n : ℕ) (hk : 0 < k) (hn : 0 < n) :
    (7^k - 3^n) ∣ (k^4 + n^2) ↔ (k, n) ∈ olympiadbench1678_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 4)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1), (2, 4)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for pairs (k,n) where (7^k - 3^n) divides (k⁴ + n²), with k,n > 0.

2. Ground truth gives only (2,4):
   - For (2,4): 7² - 3⁴ = 49 - 81 = -32
   - k⁴ + n² = 16 + 16 = 32
   - -32 divides 32, so this is valid

3. Proposed answer adds (1,1):
   - For (1,1): 7¹ - 3¹ = 4
   - k⁴ + n² = 1 + 1 = 2
   - 4 does not divide 2

The proposed answer incorrectly includes (1,1) which doesn't satisfy the condition. The only correct pair is (2,4).
