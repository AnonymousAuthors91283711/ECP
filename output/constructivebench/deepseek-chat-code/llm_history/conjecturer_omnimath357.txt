Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the enumerated answers, we see p approaches 0. The problem involves the volume of a unit square minus a p×p square (area 1 - p²). The condition (x₁ > p ∨ x₂ > p) describes the complement of [0,p]×[0,p]. Thus, the solution is when p makes the volume equal to 1 - p².
