This problem involves calculating the average speed for the third segment of a trip given specific conditions. The total distance is 96 miles. The first segment covers 60 miles in 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the second segment covers 65 miles in another 30 minutes, and the third segment covers the remaining distance in 30 minutes. We need to find the average speed for the third segment.

The Python program will calculate the third distance and then compute the speed (distance/time) for the third segment. Since all values are exact, we'll use exact fractions rather than floating-point approximations.

```python
def calculate_third_speed():
    total_distance = 96
    first_speed = 60  # mph
    first_time = 30 / 60  # hours
    first_distance = first_speed * first_time
    
    second_speed = 65  # mph
    second_time = 30 / 60  # hours
    second_distance = second_speed * second_time
    
    third_distance = total_distance - first_distance - second_distance
    third_time = 30 / 60  # hours
    third_speed = third_distance / third_time
    
    print(f"Third segment speed: {third_speed} mph")

calculate_third_speed()
```
