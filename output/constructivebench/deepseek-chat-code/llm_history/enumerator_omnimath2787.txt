The problem is to find the value of `omnimath2787_answer` such that the equation `1/9 + 1/18 = 1/omnimath2787_answer` holds. This is a simple algebraic problem where we need to find the harmonic mean of 9 and 18. 

The solution involves:
1. Calculating the sum of the reciprocals: 1/9 + 1/18 = 3/18 = 1/6
2. Taking the reciprocal of the result to find the answer: 6

Here's a Python program that verifies this calculation:

```python
# Calculate 1/9 + 1/18 and its reciprocal
numerator = 1 * 18 + 1 * 9
denominator = 9 * 18
sum_reciprocal = numerator / denominator
answer = 1 / sum_reciprocal

# Output the exact fractional form
print(f"1/9 + 1/18 = {numerator}/{denominator} = 1/{answer}")
```

The program computes the sum of the reciprocals as a fraction, simplifies it, and then finds the reciprocal of the result. The output shows the intermediate steps and the final answer.
