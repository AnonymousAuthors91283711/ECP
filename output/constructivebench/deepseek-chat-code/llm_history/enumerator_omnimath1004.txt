This problem involves finding the number of positive integers c such that for all combinations of signs s₁ and s₂ (±1), there exists a rational root r for the quadratic equation r² + s₁*p*r + s₂*c = 0, where p is a specific large prime (2^24036583 - 1). 

To approach this computationally, we'll:
1. Use a smaller prime for testing (like p=3)
2. Find all c values that satisfy the condition for all sign combinations
3. Observe the pattern to conjecture the general answer

The key insight is that for each sign combination, the discriminant must be a perfect square. This leads to conditions on c that must be satisfied simultaneously.

```python
def is_square(n):
    """Check if n is a perfect square."""
    if n < 0:
        return False
    root = int(n**0.5)
    return root * root == n

def find_valid_c(p, max_c=100):
    """Find all c values up to max_c that satisfy the condition for prime p."""
    valid_c = []
    for c in range(1, max_c + 1):
        valid = True
        # Check all four sign combinations
        for s1 in [1, -1]:
            for s2 in [1, -1]:
                # Discriminant must be perfect square
                discriminant = p*p - 4*s2*c
                if not is_square(discriminant):
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            valid_c.append(c)
            print(f"Found valid c: {c}")  # Stream partial results
    return valid_c

# Test with small prime p=3 (original problem uses much larger prime)
p = 3
print(f"Testing with p = {p}")
valid_c = find_valid_c(p, 100)

# After enumeration, print the count
print(f"Total valid c values found: {len(valid_c)}")
```
