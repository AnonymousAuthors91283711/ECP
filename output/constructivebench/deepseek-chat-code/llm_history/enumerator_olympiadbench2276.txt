This problem involves calculating the percentage increase in total cost when prices of items increase by certain percentages. We'll compute the exact value using the given parameters.

```python
def calculate_percentage_increase():
    # Given parameters
    sprice = 1.5
    lprice = 2.0
    sincrease = 0.1
    lincrease = 0.05
    squantity = 2
    lquantity = 1
    
    # Original total cost
    original_cost = squantity * sprice + lquantity * lprice
    
    # New total cost after increases
    new_cost = (squantity * (sprice * (1 + sincrease)) + lquantity * (lprice * (1 + lincrease)))
    
    # Percentage increase
    percentage_increase = (new_cost - original_cost) / original_cost
    
    # Output exact fraction and decimal approximation
    from fractions import Fraction
    exact = Fraction(percentage_increase).limit_denominator()
    print(f"Exact value as fraction: {exact}")
    print(f"Decimal approximation: {float(exact)}")

calculate_percentage_increase()
```
