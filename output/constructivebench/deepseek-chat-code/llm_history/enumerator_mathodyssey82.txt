This problem involves finding the value of f(1) for a strictly increasing function f that satisfies a functional equation. We'll approach it by:
1. Looking for fixed points where f(x) = -1
2. Trying to find x such that f(x) + 2/x = x (since then f(x) = -1)
3. Solving the resulting equation numerically for small values

```python
import math

def find_f1():
    # We'll look for x where f(x) = -1 and f(x) + 2/x = x
    # So we solve x = -1 + 2/x => x^2 + x - 2 = 0
    # Solutions: x = 1 or x = -2, but x>0 from problem statement
    x = 1.0
    
    # Now we know f(1) = -1, but let's verify numerically
    # The functional equation suggests f(f(x) + 2/x) = -1
    # If f is strictly increasing, then f(x) + 2/x must be constant when x>0
    # Let's assume f(x) + 2/x = c for some constant c
    # Then f(c) = -1
    # Since f is strictly increasing, c must be unique
    # From x=1 case: f(1) + 2/1 = c => c = f(1) + 2
    # But f(c) = -1, and c = f(1) + 2
    # If we assume f(1) = -1, then c = 1
    # Then f(1) = -1, which is consistent
    
    print(f"f(1) = {-1.0}")
