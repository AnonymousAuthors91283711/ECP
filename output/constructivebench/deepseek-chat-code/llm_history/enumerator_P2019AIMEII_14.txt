[write_program]
This problem asks for the largest positive integer n such that 91 is the largest number that cannot be expressed as 5a + nb + (n+1)c for non-negative integers a,b,c. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of n and verify the condition.

The approach:
1. For each candidate n, find all numbers that cannot be expressed as 5a + nb + (n+1)c
2. Check if 91 is the largest such number for that n
3. Find the maximum n satisfying this condition

```python
def is_expressible(m, n):
    """Check if m can be expressed as 5a + nb + (n+1)c"""
    max_a = m // 5
    for a in range(max_a + 1):
        remaining = m - 5*a
        if remaining < 0:
            continue
        max_b = remaining // n
        for b in range(max_b + 1):
            rem = remaining - n*b
            if rem >= 0 and rem % (n + 1) == 0:
                return True
    return False

def find_largest_non_expressible(n):
    """Find largest number not expressible as 5a + nb + (n+1)c"""
    # Using Chicken McNugget theorem-like approach for multiple variables
    # We'll check numbers up to a reasonable threshold
    threshold = 1000
    largest = -1
    for m in range(1, threshold):
        if not is_expressible(m, n):
            largest = m
    return largest

def main():
    max_n = 0
    # Search n from 1 to 200 (reasonable upper bound)
    for n in range(1, 201):
        largest = find_largest_non_expressible(n)
        if largest == 91:
            print(f"n = {n} satisfies condition (largest non-expressible is 91)")
            if n > max_n:
                max_n = n
    print(f"Maximum n satisfying the condition: {max_n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
