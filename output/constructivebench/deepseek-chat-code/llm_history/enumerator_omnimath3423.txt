This problem appears to be about finding a unique percentage `p` such that when you increase a value `x` by 60% (y = x * 1.6) and then decrease it by `p%`, you get back to the original value `x`. We need to find what this constant percentage `p` is.

The mathematical relationship is:
y * (1 - p) = x
Substituting y = 1.6x:
1.6x * (1 - p) = x
We can solve for p algebraically, but since this is a programming task, we'll write a program to verify this relationship numerically for sample values of x.

```python
def find_p(x):
    y = x * 1.6
    # Solve y*(1-p) = x for p
    p = 1 - (x / y)
    return p

# Test with various positive x values
test_values = [0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 100.0]
print("Testing various x values:")
for x in test_values:
    p = find_p(x)
    print(f"For x = {x}, p = {p}")

# The constant p value appears to be:
print("\nThe constant percentage p appears to be:", find_p(1.0))
```

The program demonstrates that for any positive x, the required percentage p is consistently 0.375 (or 37.5%). This makes sense algebraically since:
1.6 * (1 - p) = 1
1 - p = 1/1.6
p = 1 - 1/1.6 = 0.375
