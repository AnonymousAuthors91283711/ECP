This problem involves finding the value of f(12) given a multiplicative function f with specific values at 2 and 3, and a functional equation. We'll enumerate possible functions f that satisfy the given conditions and compute f(12) for each valid candidate.

The functional equation suggests f is completely multiplicative. We'll:
1. Assume f is completely multiplicative (f(ab) = f(a) + f(b))
2. Use given values f(2)=5, f(3)=7
3. Compute f(1) using the functional equation
4. Compute f(12) = f(2Â²*3) = 2*f(2) + f(3)

```python
def compute_f12():
    # Given values
    f2 = 5
    f3 = 7
    
    # Compute f(1) using f(1*1) = f(1) + f(1) => f(1) = 0
    f1 = 0
    
    # Compute f(12) = f(2^2 * 3) = 2*f(2) + f(3)
    f12 = 2 * f2 + f3
    
    print(f"f(12) = {f12}")

compute_f12()
```
