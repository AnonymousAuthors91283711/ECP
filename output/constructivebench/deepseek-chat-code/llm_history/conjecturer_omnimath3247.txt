theorem omnimath3247
(k : ℕ)
(hk : k % 7 = 3)
: (3 * k) % 7 = omnimath3247_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing k ≡ 3 mod 7 cases:
k = 3 ≡ 3 mod 7: (3*k) mod 7 = 2
k = 10 ≡ 3 mod 7: (3*k) mod 7 = 2
k = 17 ≡ 3 mod 7: (3*k) mod 7 = 2
k = 24 ≡ 3 mod 7: (3*k) mod 7 = 2
k = 31 ≡ 3 mod 7: (3*k) mod 7 = 2
k = 38 ≡ 3 mod 7: (3*k) mod 7 = 2
k = 45 ≡ 3 mod 7: (3*k) mod 7 = 2

From the pattern, we conclude that for all k ≡ 3 mod 7,
(3*k) mod 7 = 2
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
