    let t := 1/4      let t' := t * 60      (10 - r) * t' ≤ 30}    P2008AMCA_7_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: 8. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 8 column 22, which is at "let t' := t * 60    " in "    let t := 1/4      let t' := t * 60      (10 - r) * t' ≤ 30}    P2008AMCA_7_answer := by sorry", there is an error: expected ';' or line break.
. Enumerated Answers: r = 7.9: condition fails
r = 8.0: condition holds
r = 8.1: condition holds

The least r satisfying the condition is: 8.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the problem statement and error message, I can see this is about finding the least real number r ≥ 0 that satisfies the inequality (10 - r) * (1/4 * 60) ≤ 30. The error appears to be just a syntax issue with line breaks in the set definition.

Looking at the enumerated answers:
- r=7.9 fails (7.9 is too small)
- r=8.0 passes
- r=8.1 passes

The minimal r satisfying the condition is clearly 8.0. The mathematical reasoning is:
1. Simplify the inequality: (10 - r) * 15 ≤ 30
2. Divide both sides by 15: 10 - r ≤ 2
3. Rearrange: r ≥ 8

Here's the corrected answer in Lean:
