[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n where the sum of absolute differences between each k (from 1 to n-1) and the nearest perfect square to k equals 100n. We'll write a Python program to search for such n by computing the sum for increasing n values until we find the minimal solution.

The approach:
1. For each k from 1 to n-1, compute the nearest perfect square (using rounding of sqrt(k))
2. Sum the absolute differences |k - nearest_square^2|
3. Check when this sum equals 100n
4. Return the smallest such n

```python
import math

def find_min_n():
    n = 1
    while True:
        total = 0
        for k in range(1, n):
            sqrt_k = math.sqrt(k)
            nearest_square = round(sqrt_k) ** 2
            total += abs(k - nearest_square)
        if total == 100 * n:
            print(f"Found candidate: {n}")
            return n  # Return first (smallest) solution found
        n += 1
        if n % 1000 == 0:  # Progress indicator
            print(f"Checked up to n={n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_n()
```

Note: There appears to be a typo in the variable name 'nearest_square' vs 'nearest_square' in the original code. The corrected version would use consistent variable naming. The program will find and return the smallest n satisfying the condition.
