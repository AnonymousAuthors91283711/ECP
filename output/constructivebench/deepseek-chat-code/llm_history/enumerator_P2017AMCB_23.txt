This problem involves finding the value of a cubic polynomial f at 0, given specific conditions. The polynomial passes through points (2,4), (3,9), (4,16), and has three other special points D, E, F whose sum is 24. We'll enumerate possible cubic polynomials satisfying the given conditions and compute f(0).

```python
def find_f0():
    # Points the cubic must pass through
    points = [(2,4), (3,9), (4,16)]
    
    # General form of cubic: f(x) = a(x-2)(x-3)(x-4) + g(x)
    # where g(x) is the quadratic passing through the three points
    # Compute g(x) using Newton's divided differences
    # g(x) = 4 + 5(x-2) + (x-2)(x-3)
    
    # So f(x) = a(x-2)(x-3)(x-4) + x^2
    # Now find D, E, F which are roots of f(x) = L(x) where L(x) are the secant lines
    
    # For D: f(D) = 5(D-2) + 4 = 5D - 6
    # So a(D-2)(D-3)(D-4) + D^2 = 5D - 6
    # Similarly for E and F
    
    # We'll solve for a numerically
    from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve
    a = symbols('a')
    
    # Equation for D
    D = symbols('D')
    eq_D = Eq(a*(D-2)*(D-3)*(D-4) + D**2, 5*D - 6)
    # Similarly for E and F
    E = symbols('E')
    eq_E = Eq(a*(E-2)*(E-3)*(E-4) + E**2, 6*E - 8)
    F = symbols('F')
    eq_F = Eq(a*(F-2)*(F-3)*(F-4) + F**2, 7*F - 12)
    
    # We need to find a such that D+E+F=24 for some roots
    # Let's try to find a numerically

        a_val, D_val, E_val, F_val = vars
        eq1 = a_val*(D_val-2)*(D_val-3)*(D_val-4) + D_val**2 - (5*D_val - 6)
        eq2 = a_val*(E_val-2)*(E_val-3)*(E_val-4) + E_val**2 - (6*E_val - 8)
        eq3 = a_val*(F_val-2)*(F_val-3)*(F_val-4) + F_val**2 - (7*F_val - 12)
        eq4 = D_val + E_val + F_val - 24
        return [eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4]
    
    # Initial guess
    guess = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 22.0]
    solution = fsolve(equations, guess)
    a_sol, D_sol, E_sol, F_sol = solution
    
    # Now compute f(0)
    f0 = a_sol*(0-2)*(0-3)*(0-4) + 0**2
    print(f"f(0) = {f0}")
