This problem involves finding the set of real numbers `y` for which a certain recurrence relation holds. The recurrence is defined by `a(n+2) = x*a(n+1) + y*a(n)`, and we need to find when there exists an integer `m` such that the difference equation `a(m+3) - a(m+1) = a(m+1) - a(m)` holds for all initial values `a₀, a₁`.

To approach this computationally, we'll:
1. Fix small values for x and m
2. Symbolically compute the recurrence relations
3. Solve for y that satisfies the condition

We'll use sympy for symbolic computation and enumerate possible y values for small parameters.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, simplify

def find_valid_y_values():
    # Try small integer values for x and m
    for x_val in [-1, 0, 1, 2]:
        for m_val in [0, 1, 2]:
            print(f"\nTesting x={x_val}, m={m_val}")
            
            # Define symbols
            a0, a1, y = symbols('a0 a1 y')
            
            # Compute recurrence terms symbolically
            a = [a0, a1]
            for n in range(2, m_val + 4):
                a.append(x_val * a[-1] + y * a[-2])
            
            # Form the equation
            lhs = a[m_val + 3] - a[m_val + 1]
            rhs = a[m_val + 1] - a[m_val]
            equation = Eq(lhs, rhs)
            
            # Simplify and solve for y
            simplified_eq = simplify(equation)
            solutions = solve(simplified_eq, y)
            
            print(f"Equation: {simplified_eq}")
            print(f"Solutions for y: {solutions}")
