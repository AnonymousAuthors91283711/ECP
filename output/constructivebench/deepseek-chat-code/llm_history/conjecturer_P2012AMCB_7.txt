Result: 22.5. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
From the enumerated answers, we can see:
- 3rd red light occurs at position 5
- 21st red light occurs at position 50
- The calculation is ((50 - 5) * 6)/12 = (45 * 6)/12 = 270/12 = 22.5 = 45/2

The pattern [0,0,1,1,1] means:
- Positions with 0 are red lights (positions 0,1 mod 5)
- Positions with 1 are green lights (positions 2,3,4 mod 5)

The error in the Lean code appears to be a syntax issue with multiple let bindings on the same line. However, the mathematical answer itself is correct based on the pattern and calculations.

Here's the fixed answer in Lean:

Result: 22.5. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
From the enumerated answers, we can see:
- 3rd red light occurs at position 5
- 21st red light occurs at position 50
- The calculation is ((50 - 5) * 6)/12 = (45 * 6)/12 = 270/12 = 22.5 = 45/2

The error in the original code appears to be a syntax issue with multiple let declarations on the same line. However, the mathematical answer we need to provide is clearly 45/2 based on the calculation.

Here's the corrected answer in Lean format:

<<<45/2>>>

Explanation:
1. The pattern [0,0,1,1,1] means red lights occur at positions where index mod 5 is 0 or 1 (0-based)
2. The 3rd red light is at position 5 (indices 0,1,5)
3. The 21st red light is at position 50 (following the pattern)
4. The calculation ((50-5)*6)/12 gives 45/2 as shown
5. The answer is already in ℚ type since we're using the division operator between integers[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
