[write_program]
This problem involves evaluating a large arithmetic expression with a specific pattern. We'll write a Python program to compute the exact value of the expression by breaking it down into manageable parts.

The expression is:
2011 * 20122012 * 201320132013 - 2013 * 20112011 * 201220122012

We'll compute this directly in Python using arbitrary-precision integers to avoid overflow issues.

```python
# Compute the large arithmetic expression exactly
a = 2011
b = 20122012
c = 201320132013
d = 2013
e = 20112011
f = 201220122012

result = a * b * c - d * e * f
print(result)
```
