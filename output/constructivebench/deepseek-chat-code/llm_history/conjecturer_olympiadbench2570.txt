theorem olympiadbench2570 (a b c : ℤ) :
    (b - a = c - b ∧ a + b + c = 60 ∧ ∃ r, (a - 2) * r = b ∧ b * r = c + 3) ↔ 
    (a, b, c) ∈ olympiadbench2570_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solution found: a=18, b=20, c=22, r=1.25
Solution found: a=27, b=20, c=13, r=0.8. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ × ℤ)
<<<{(18, 20, 22), (27, 20, 13)}>>>
