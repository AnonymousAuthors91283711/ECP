This problem involves solving a system of logarithmic equations with positive real variables x, y, z, and finding minimal p+q where x*y^5*z can be expressed as (1/2)^(p/q) with coprime p,q. We'll enumerate possible rational exponents by checking small denominators.

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def solve():
    # First solve the system of logarithmic equations
    # From the equations, we can derive:
    # x + y + z = 1
    # x + y - z = 1/e
    # x - y + z = 1/e^2
    # -x + y + z = 1/e^3
    
    # Solving gives:
    e = math.e
    x = (1 + 1/e - 1/e**2 - 1/e**3)/2
    y = (1 - 1/e + 1/e**2 - 1/e**3)/2
    z = (1 - 1/e - 1/e**2 + 1/e**3)/2
    
    # Compute x*y^5*z
    product = x * (y**5) * z
    
    # Find rational approximations of -log2(product) with small denominators
    target = -math.log2(product)
    min_pq = None
    
    # Check denominators up to 20
    for q in range(1, 21):
        # Find best p for this q
        p = round(target * q)
        # Check nearby values in case of rounding errors
        for delta in [-1, 0, 1]:
            current_p = p + delta
            if current_p <= 0:
                continue
            current_frac = Fraction(current_p, q)
            # Check if approximation is close enough
            if abs(target - current_frac.numerator/current_frac.denominator) < 1e-8:
                # Reduce to simplest form
                reduced = current_frac.limit_denominator(1000)
                p_reduced = reduced.numerator
                q_reduced = reduced.denominator
                sum_pq = p_reduced + q_reduced
                print(f"Found candidate: p/q = {p_reduced}/{q_reduced}, p+q = {sum_pq}")
                if min_pq is None or sum_pq < min_pq:
                    min_pq = sum_pq
    
    print(f"Minimal p+q found: {min_pq}")
