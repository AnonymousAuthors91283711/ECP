Ground Truth Answer: fun n => if n % 6 = 0 then 0 else 2004 - (n % 6)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n % 2 = 0 then 2004 + (n - 1) else 2004 - (n - 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive function f with initial values f(0)=2001, f(1)=2002, f(2)=2003, and a recurrence relation f(k+3) = f(k+1) + f(k) - f(k+2).

2. The ground truth answer shows a periodic pattern with period 6, where:
   - When n is divisible by 6, the result is 0
   - Otherwise, it's 2004 minus (n mod 6)

3. The proposed answer suggests a different pattern based on parity (n mod 2):
   - For even n: 2004 + (n-1)
   - For odd n: 2004 - (n-1)

Let's test some values:
- For n=3 (odd): 
  Ground truth: 2004 - 3 = 2001
  Proposed: 2004 - 2 = 2002 (incorrect)
- For n=4 (even):
  Ground truth: 2004 - 4 = 2000
  Proposed: 2004 + 3 = 2007 (incorrect)
- For n=6 (even):
  Ground truth: 0
  Proposed: 2004 + 5 = 2009 (incorrect)

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth for any n ≥ 3. The patterns are completely different.
