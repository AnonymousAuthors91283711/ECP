This problem involves calculating the floor of a complex expression involving powers and divisions of large numbers. We'll approach it by:
1. Simplifying the expression algebraically
2. Computing exact values where possible
3. Estimating the floating point value to determine the floor

The key simplification is to rewrite the expression as a difference of two terms, each of form (n^3)/((n-2)(n-1)) and find a pattern or closed form.

```python
import math

def compute_expression(n):
    """Compute (n^3)/((n-2)(n-1)) - ((n-2)^3)/((n-1)n)"""
    term1 = n**3 / ((n-2)*(n-1))
    term2 = (n-2)**3 / ((n-1)*n)
    return term1 - term2

# Compute for n=2005 (since 2003 = 2005-2)
n = 2005
exact_value = compute_expression(n)

# Compute floor value
floor_value = math.floor(exact_value)

# Print intermediate values and final result
print(f"For n={n}:")
print(f"  Exact value (approx): {exact_value}")
print(f"  Floor value: {floor_value}")
```
