Ground Truth Answer: {(12, 36, 48), (21, 63, 84)}
Proposed Answer: { (a, b, c) | ∃ (k : ℕ), (a = 12*k ∧ b = 36*k ∧ c = 48*k) ∨ (a = 21*k ∧ b = 63*k ∧ c = 84*k) }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is looking for all triplets (p,q,r) of 2-digit numbers where:
   - Each number has distinct digits
   - All digits across the three numbers are distinct (6 unique digits total)
   - They satisfy the given equation involving digit sums

2. The ground truth provides two specific solutions: (12,36,48) and (21,63,84)

3. The proposed answer suggests a parameterized solution with a scaling factor k

Key observations:
- The problem constrains p,q,r to be 2-digit numbers (Icc 10 99)
- For k=1, the proposed answer matches the ground truth
- For k>1, the numbers would exceed 99 (e.g., k=2 gives (24,72,96) which are still 2-digit, but k=3 would exceed)
- The proposed answer doesn't enforce the digit uniqueness constraints for k>1
- The digit uniqueness constraints would likely fail for k>1 even if numbers stay 2-digit

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It allows solutions beyond the 2-digit constraint
2. It doesn't maintain the digit uniqueness requirements for k>1
3. Only the k=1 cases are valid solutions
