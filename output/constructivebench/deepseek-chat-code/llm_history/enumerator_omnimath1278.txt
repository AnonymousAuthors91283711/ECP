This problem involves finding a rational function `f` that satisfies a functional equation. The goal is to determine `f(-2)` given the equation `3*f(1/x) + 2*f(x)/x = x^2` for all non-zero rational `x`. 

We'll approach this by:
1. Assuming `f` is a rational function of the form `f(x) = (ax³ + bx² + cx + d)/(ex + f)`
2. Plugging this into the functional equation and solving for coefficients
3. Simplifying to find the simplest possible form of `f`
4. Evaluating `f(-2)` with the found coefficients

Here's a Python program to help explore possible forms of `f` and verify solutions:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, simplify

def find_and_evaluate():
    x = symbols('x')
    # Try simplest rational form: f(x) = (a*x^3 + b*x^2)/(c*x + d)
    a, b, c, d = symbols('a b c d')
    f = (a*x**3 + b*x**2)/(c*x + d)
    
    # Substitute into functional equation
    lhs = 3*f.subs(x, 1/x) + 2*f/x
    rhs = x**2
    
    # Get equation and clear denominators
    eq = Eq(lhs, rhs)
    eq = simplify(eq.lhs - eq.rhs)
    eq = simplify(eq * x**2 * (c + d*x))  # Clear denominators
    
    # Collect coefficients for powers of x
    coeffs = {}
    for power in range(5):  # Highest power in expanded equation
        coeff = eq.coeff(x, power)
        if coeff != 0:
            coeffs[power] = coeff
    
    # Solve the system of equations
    solutions = solve(list(coeffs.values()), (a, b, c, d))
    
    # Print all found solutions
    for sol in solutions:
        print("Solution:", sol)
        simplified_f = f.subs(sol)
        print("f(x) =", simplified_f)
        print("f(-2) =", simplified_f.subs(x, -2))
        print()

find_and_evaluate()
```

The program uses symbolic computation to:
1. Assume a general rational form for f(x)
2. Substitute into the functional equation
3. Solve for the coefficients
4. Evaluate f(-2) for each solution found

The output will show possible forms of f(x) and their values at x=-2. The simplest solution should match the expected answer (though we don't state it here as per requirements).

Let me analyze the problem and the program:

1. Problem Analysis:
- We need to find a rational function f: ℚ → ℚ satisfying the functional equation 3f(1/x) + 2f(x)/x = x² for x ≠ 0
- The goal is to compute f(-2)
- The functional equation suggests f is likely a rational function (ratio of polynomials)

2. Program Analysis:
- The program attempts to find f in the form (ax³ + bx²)/(cx + d)
- It substitutes this form into the functional equation and tries to solve for coefficients
- However, it fails to find any solutions (outputs empty result)

3. Issues:
- The ansatz (assumed form) might be too restrictive
- The denominator clearing might be incomplete
- The coefficient collection might miss some constraints

4. Correct Approach:
- We should try a simpler form first (lower degree)
- The functional equation suggests f(x) should have terms that balance x² when combined
- A better ansatz would be f(x) = (ax³ + bx² + c)/x

Judgement: The original program is rejected because it fails to find any solution.

<<<False>>>

Here's the corrected program:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, simplify

def find_and_evaluate():
    x = symbols('x')
    # Try simpler rational form: f(x) = (a*x^3 + b*x^2 + c)/x
    a, b, c = symbols('a b c')
    f = (a*x**3 + b*x**2 + c)/x
    
    # Substitute into functional equation
    lhs = 3*f.subs(x, 1/x) + 2*f/x
    rhs = x**2
    
    # Simplify equation
    eq = Eq(lhs, rhs)
    eq = simplify(eq.lhs - eq.rhs)
    
    # Collect coefficients for powers of x
    coeffs = {}
    for power in range(-2, 5):  # Wider range for negative exponents
        coeff = eq.coeff(x, power)
        if coeff != 0:
            coeffs[power] = coeff
    
    # Solve the system of equations
    solutions = solve(list(coeffs.values()), (a, b, c))
    
    # Print all

Explanation:
The problem involves finding the value of a function f at x = -2, given a functional equation. Since no Python program was provided to enumerate possible answers, we must create one from scratch. The functional equation relates f(x) and f(1/x), suggesting we can set up a system of equations to solve for f(-2).

The original submission is empty, so it must be rejected. Below is a corrected Python program that:
1. Sets up the functional equation for x and 1/x
2. Solves the resulting system of equations for f(-2)
3. Outputs the exact rational solution

The program uses sympy for symbolic computation to handle exact rational arithmetic and solve the system of equations.

<<<False>>>

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational

def solve_omnimath1278():
    # Define symbols for f(x) and f(1/x)
    x_val = -2
    fx, finvx = symbols('fx finvx')
    
    # Create equations from the functional relation
    # For x = -2
    eq1 = Eq(3*finvx + 2*fx/x_val, x_val**2)
    # For x = -1/2 (which is 1/x when x = -2)
    eq2 = Eq(3*fx + 2*finvx/(-Rational(1,2)), (-Rational(1,2))**2)
    
    # Solve the system of equations
    solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (fx, finvx))
    
    # Output the solution for f(-2)
    print(solution[fx])
