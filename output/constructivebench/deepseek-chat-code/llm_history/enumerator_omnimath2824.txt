This problem involves finding the distance between two points on two different lines where the lines intersect the x-axis. The lines are given by `line1(x) = 2x + 6` and `line2(x) = -4x + 6`. We need to find the x-intercepts of both lines (where y=0), then compute the absolute difference between them.

The Python program will:
1. Find x-intercepts by solving `2x + 6 = 0` and `-4x + 6 = 0`
2. Compute the absolute difference between these intercepts
3. Output the exact value as a fraction rather than decimal

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def find_x_intercept(a, b):
    """Solve ax + b = 0 for x"""
    return Fraction(-b, a)

# Line 1: 2x + 6 = 0
x1 = find_x_intercept(2, 6)
# Line 2: -4x + 6 = 0
x2 = find_x_intercept(-4, 6)

distance = abs(x1 - x2)
print(f"x1 = {x1}, x2 = {x2}")
print(f"|x1 - x2| = {distance}")
```
