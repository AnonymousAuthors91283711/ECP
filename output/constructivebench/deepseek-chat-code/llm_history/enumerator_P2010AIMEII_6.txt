[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that there exist non-constant integer polynomials P and Q where:
1. The product P*Q has coefficient 1 for x⁴ term
2. The product P*Q has coefficient (63-n) for x term
3. Both P and Q are non-constant (degree > 0)

We'll enumerate possible combinations of polynomial degrees and coefficients to find the minimal n satisfying these conditions.

```python
from itertools import product

    min_n = float('inf')
    # Try degree combinations (1,3) and (2,2) since deg(P*Q)=4
    for (d1, d2) in [(1,3), (2,2), (3,1)]:
        # Coefficients for P: a0 + a1*x (if deg=1) or a0 + a1*x + a2*x^2 (if deg=2)
        # Similarly for Q
        # We need to find coefficients such that:
        # 1. x^4 coefficient in P*Q is 1
        # 2. x coefficient in P*Q is 63 - n
        # We'll limit coefficient search to small absolute values
        max_coeff = 3  # Reasonable limit for manual checking
