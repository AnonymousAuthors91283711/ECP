Ground Truth Answer: 132
Proposed Answer: 11 * 19 * 7 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 5 * 13
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest positive integer m where m² - m + 11 is a product of at least 4 distinct primes.

2. The ground truth answer is 132, which satisfies:
   132² - 132 + 11 = 17424 - 132 + 11 = 17303
   The prime factorization of 17303 is 11 × 13 × 11 × 11 (which doesn't match the requirement of distinct primes)

3. The proposed answer gives a product of primes (11 × 19 × 7 × 3 × 2 × 1 × 5 × 13), but:
   - It includes 1 which is not a prime
   - The product equals 570570, which doesn't match any m² - m + 11
   - It's not even a number (m) but a factorization

The proposed answer is completely incorrect and doesn't address the problem requirements.
