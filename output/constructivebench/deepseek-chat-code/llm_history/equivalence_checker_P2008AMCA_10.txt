noncomputable abbrev P2008AMCA_10_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem P2008AMCA_10 (t : ℝ) :
  (1/5 + 1/7) * (t - 1) = 1 ↔ P2008AMCA_10_answer t = 1 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun t => (1/5 + 1/7) * (t - 1)
Proposed Answer: fun t : ℝ => 47/12
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem shows an equation (1/5 + 1/7)*(t-1) = 1 and asks for a function where this equation holds when the function equals 1.

2. The ground truth answer is the left side of the equation: (1/5 + 1/7)*(t-1)

3. The proposed answer is a constant function 47/12, which is approximately 3.9167

The two answers are fundamentally different:
- The ground truth is a linear function of t
- The proposed answer is a constant that doesn't depend on t

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the original equation for any t, nor does it represent the same mathematical object as the ground truth.
