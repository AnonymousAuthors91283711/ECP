[write_program]
The problem appears to be a placeholder from Lean theorem proving (Mathlib) rather than a concrete high-school competition problem. Since no specific mathematical problem is stated, I'll create a Python program that enumerates possible answers for a sample high-school level problem: finding all positive integers n where n^2 + 1 is divisible by 5.

This program will:
1. Search for numbers n where n² + 1 ≡ 0 mod 5
2. Enumerate solutions up to a reasonable threshold
3. Look for patterns in the solutions

```python
def find_solutions():
    print("Finding numbers n where n² + 1 is divisible by 5:")
    max_n = 50  # Reasonable threshold for demonstration
    solutions = []
    
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        if (n**2 + 1) % 5 == 0:
            solutions.append(n)
            print(f"Found solution: n = {n} (since {n}² + 1 = {n**2 + 1})")
    
    print("\nObserved pattern in solutions modulo 5:")
    for n in solutions:
        print(f"{n} ≡ {n % 5} mod 5")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solutions()
```
