theorem omnimath1264
: IsLeast {k : ℕ | ∃ a b c : ℝ, a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ c > 0 ∧ k = ⌊(a + b) / c⌋ + ⌊(b + c) / a⌋ + ⌊(c + a) / b⌋} omnimath1264_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: New minimal k=6 found at a=1, b=1, c=1
New minimal k=5 found at a=2, b=2, c=3
New minimal k=4 found at a=3, b=4, c=4

The minimal k found is: 4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<4>>>
