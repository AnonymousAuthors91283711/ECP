theorem P2011AIMEI_15 (m : ℤ) (a b c : ℤ) 
  (h : (X - C a) * (X - C b) * (X - C c) = X^3 - C 2011 * X + C m) :

Ground Truth Answer: fun m => let roots := (X^3 - C 2011 * X + C m).roots.toFinset
           Finset.sum roots (fun x => abs x)
Proposed Answer: fun m => 2 * (Int.natAbs (2011 + m) + Int.natAbs (2011 - m))
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
- We have a cubic polynomial x³ - 2011x + m with integer roots a, b, c
- We need to find the sum of absolute values of the roots |a| + |b| + |c|
- The ground truth answer correctly computes this by finding the roots and summing their absolute values

Proposed Answer Analysis:
- The proposed answer suggests 2*(|2011 + m| + |2011 - m|)
- This is incorrect because:
  1. The sum of absolute values of roots doesn't directly relate to 2011 ± m in this way
  2. For example, when m=0, the roots are 0, ±√2011, so sum should be 2√2011, but proposed answer gives 2*(2011 + 2011) = 8044
  3. There's no mathematical justification for this formula in terms of Vieta's relations

Conclusion:
The proposed answer is completely different from and incorrect compared to the ground truth answer.
