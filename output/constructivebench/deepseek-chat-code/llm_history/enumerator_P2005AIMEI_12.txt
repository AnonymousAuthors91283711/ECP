This problem involves counting the number of integers n in the range 0 to 2004 where S(n+1) is odd or even, and finding the absolute difference between these counts. S(n) is defined as the sum of the number of divisors for each integer from 1 to n.

To approach this, we'll:
1. Compute S(n) for small values of n to identify a pattern
2. Count how many times S(n) is odd/even up to 2005
3. Find the absolute difference between these counts

The key observation is that S(n) is odd only when n is a perfect square or twice a perfect square, due to the properties of divisor counts.

```python
def count_divisors(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i == n // i:
                count += 1
            else:
                count += 2
    return count

def S(n):
    return sum(count_divisors(k) for k in range(1, n+1))

def find_pattern(max_n):
    odd_count = 0
    even_count = 0
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        s = S(n)
        if s % 2 == 1:
            odd_count += 1
        else:
            even_count += 1
    return abs(odd_count - even_count)

# Test with small values first to verify the pattern
for n in [10, 20, 50]:
    print(f"For n up to {n}: difference = {find_pattern(n)}")

# Now compute for the actual problem size
result = find_pattern(2005)
print(f"Final answer: {result}")
```
