theorem P2012AMCB_6 (x y ε : ℝ) : 
  x > y ∧ y > 0 ∧ ε > 0 → (x + ε) - (y - ε) > x - y ↔ P2012AMCB_6_answer x y ε := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x y ε => x > y ∧ y > 0 ∧ ε > 0 → (x + ε) - (y - ε) > x - y
Proposed Answer: fun x y ε => ε > 0 ∧ y > 0 ∧ x > y
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for conditions under which (x + ε) - (y - ε) > x - y holds, given x > y ∧ y > 0 ∧ ε > 0.

2. Simplifying the inequality:
   (x + ε) - (y - ε) > x - y
   x + ε - y + ε > x - y
   2ε > 0
   ε > 0

3. The ground truth answer correctly shows that the inequality reduces to ε > 0 under the given conditions (x > y ∧ y > 0 ∧ ε > 0).

4. The proposed answer states ε > 0 ∧ y > 0 ∧ x > y, which are exactly the given conditions, not the simplified result.

The proposed answer is listing the initial conditions rather than showing what the inequality simplifies to. Therefore, it's not equivalent to the ground truth answer.
