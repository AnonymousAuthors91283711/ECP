[write_program]
This problem involves finding polynomials P that satisfy a specific functional equation. We'll write a Python program to enumerate low-degree polynomials and check the condition for small values of n.

The approach will be:
1. Fix small values of n (starting with n=2)
2. Generate polynomials P of increasing degrees
3. For each P, check if it satisfies the given equation
4. Output any matching polynomials found

```python
import numpy as np
from itertools import product
from sympy import symbols, Poly, degree

def check_condition(n, P_coeffs):
    x = symbols('x')
    P = Poly(P_coeffs, x)
    if degree(P) <= 0:
        return False
    
    # Left side: product of P(x^(i+1)) for i=0..n-1
    left = 1
    for i in range(n):
        term = P.compose(Poly(x**(i+1), x))
        left *= term
    
    # Right side: P(x^(n(n+1)/2))
    exponent = n * (n + 1) // 2
    right = P.compose(Poly(x**exponent, x))
    
    # Compare the expanded polynomials
    return left == right

def enumerate_polynomials(max_degree=3, max_coeff=2, max_n=3):
    for n in range(2, max_n + 1):
        print(f"\nChecking n = {n}")
        for deg in range(1, max_degree + 1):
            # Generate all polynomials of degree deg with coefficients in [-max_coeff, max_coeff]
            for coeffs in product(range(-max_coeff, max_coeff + 1), repeat=deg + 1):
                if coeffs[-1] == 0:  # Skip if not actually degree deg
                    continue
                if check_condition(n, coeffs):
                    print(f"Found matching polynomial for n={n}: P(x) = {coeffs}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_polynomials()
```
