[write_program]
This problem involves analyzing the asymptotic behavior of a sequence M(n) defined in terms of binomial coefficients. The sequence M(n) is defined as the supremum of all integers m â‰¥ n such that the binomial coefficient C(m, n-1) > C(m-1, n). The theorem states that M(n)/n converges to some limit.

To understand this behavior, we'll write a Python program to compute M(n) for small values of n and observe the ratio M(n)/n. We'll look for patterns in these ratios to conjecture about the limit.

```python
import math

def compute_M(n):
    """Compute M(n) as defined in the problem."""
    m = n
    while True:
        # Check if C(m, n-1) > C(m-1, n)
        if n == 1:
            # Special case: C(m,0) = 1 and C(m-1,1) = m-1
            # So 1 > m-1 implies m < 2
            if 1 > m - 1:
                pass  # continue searching
            else:
                return m - 1
        else:
            try:
                lhs = math.comb(m, n-1)
                rhs = math.comb(m-1, n)
                if lhs > rhs:
                    m += 1
                else:
                    return m - 1
            except OverflowError:
                # When numbers get too large, we'll assume the inequality fails
                return m - 1

def main():
    max_n = 20  # Reasonable upper bound for demonstration
    print("n\tM(n)\tM(n)/n")
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        M = compute_M(n)
        ratio = M / n
        print(f"{n}\t{M}\t{ratio:.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program computes M(n) by checking the binomial coefficient inequality for increasing values of m starting from n. For each n, it finds the largest m where the inequality holds. The output shows n, M(n), and the ratio M(n)/n, which helps observe the convergence behavior. The special case n=1 is handled separately since C(m,0) is always 1.
