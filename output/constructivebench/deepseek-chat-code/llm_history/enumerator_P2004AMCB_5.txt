[write_program]
This problem asks to find a natural number d such that:
1. 10*d/7 - 60 = d (using integer division)
2. The sum of its digits equals 5
3. The solution is unique

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of d that satisfy these conditions. The program will:
1. Iterate through possible d values
2. Check the equation condition first (more restrictive)
3. For matching d values, check the digit sum condition
4. Print all candidates that satisfy both conditions

```python
def find_d():
    # We'll search up to a reasonable threshold where 10*d/7 - 60 could equal d
    # The equation implies d â‰ˆ 140, but we'll check a wider range
    for d in range(1, 1000):
        if (10 * d) // 7 - 60 == d:
            digit_sum = sum(int(c) for c in str(d))
            if digit_sum == 5:
                print(f"Found candidate: {d}")

find_d()
```
