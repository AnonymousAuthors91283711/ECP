This problem involves solving a nested logarithmic equation with constraints. We'll approach it by:
1. Solving the equation step by step
2. Checking the constraints
3. Enumerating possible solutions while ensuring all conditions are met

The key steps are:
- First solve the outer logarithm equation
- Then solve the inner logarithm equation
- Finally verify all constraints

```python
import math

def solve_problem():
    # Solve log_2(log_2(2x - 2)) = 2
    # Let y = log_2(2x - 2), then log_2(y) = 2 => y = 4
    # So log_2(2x - 2) = 4 => 2x - 2 = 16 => x = 9
    
    # Now verify all constraints
    x = 9
    condition1 = math.log(math.log(2*x - 2, 2), 2) == 2
    condition2 = (2*x - 2) > 0
    condition3 = math.log(2*x - 2, 2) > 0
    
    # Print the solution and verification
    print(f"Solution candidate: x = {x}")
    print(f"Verification:")
    print(f"  log2(log2(2x-2)) = 2: {condition1}")
    print(f"  2x-2 > 0: {condition2}")
    print(f"  log2(2x-2) > 0: {condition3}")
