Ground Truth Answer: 50 / 101
Proposed Answer: 4950 / 10099
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem involves solving for x in the equation:
   (sum_{n=0}^{98} (n+1) + x)/101 = 100x

2. The sum in the numerator is sum_{n=1}^{99} n = 99*100/2 = 4950

3. So the equation becomes: (4950 + x)/101 = 100x

4. Solving this:
   4950 + x = 10100x
   4950 = 10099x
   x = 4950/10099

5. The ground truth answer is 50/101 ≈ 0.49505
   The proposed answer is 4950/10099 ≈ 0.49015

These are clearly different values. The proposed answer correctly follows from the equation setup, while the ground truth answer appears incorrect.
