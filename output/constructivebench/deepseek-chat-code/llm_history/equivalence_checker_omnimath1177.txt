Ground Truth Answer: 253
Proposed Answer: 57 * 2^10 + 1
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n such that for any function f mapping from Fin n × Fin 10 to Bool, there exists a subset of size 57 where either all agree on some pair of coordinates (i,j) or all disagree.

2. The ground truth answer is 253, which comes from the Erdős–Ginzburg–Ziv theorem and related Ramsey-type results in combinatorics.

3. The proposed answer is 57 * 2^10 + 1 = 57*1024 + 1 = 58369, which is much larger than 253.

4. The proposed answer appears to be an overcounting attempt that doesn't properly account for the combinatorial constraints of the problem.

The answers are not equivalent, and the proposed answer is incorrect.
