abbrev omnimath330_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath330 (p q : ℕ) :
  p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ IsSquare (p - q) ∧ IsSquare (p * q - q) ↔ (p, q) ∈ omnimath330_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(3, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(2, 2), (3, 2), (5, 2), (17, 2)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for pairs of prime numbers (p, q) where:
   - Both p and q are prime
   - p - q is a perfect square
   - p*q - q is a perfect square

2. Let's test the proposed pairs:
   - (3,2): 
     - 3-2=1 (square), 3*2-2=4 (square) → valid
   - (2,2):
     - 2-2=0 (square), 2*2-2=2 (not square) → invalid
   - (5,2):
     - 5-2=3 (not square) → invalid
   - (17,2):
     - 17-2=15 (not square) → invalid

3. Only (3,2) satisfies all conditions from the proposed answer.

4. The ground truth answer correctly identifies only (3,2) as the solution.
