[write_program]
The problem asks for the count of natural numbers n between 1 and 24 (exclusive) that cannot be expressed as a difference of two squares (a² - b² where a,b are integers). We'll write a Python program to enumerate these numbers.

Key observations:
1. Any number n can be written as (a+b)(a-b)
2. This requires n to be expressible as a product of two integers of the same parity (both odd or both even)
3. Therefore, numbers that are congruent to 2 mod 4 cannot be expressed this way

```python
def is_difference_of_squares(n):
    # Check if n can be written as a^2 - b^2
    # Equivalent to checking if n can be factored into (k+m)*(k-m)
    if n == 0:
        return True
    # Check all possible divisors
    for d in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % d == 0:
            q = n // d
            # Check if (d+q) is even (then a=(d+q)/2, b=(q-d)/2)
            if (d + q) % 2 == 0 and (q - d) % 2 == 0:
                return True
    return False

def main():
    count = 0
    for n in range(1, 25):
        if not is_difference_of_squares(n):
            print(n)
            count += 1
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
