Based on the problem statement, we're looking for consecutive integers A and B (where B = A + 1) that satisfy the equation B² + 2B + 3 = A² + 2A + 3. Simplifying this, we get B² - A² + 2(B - A) = 0, which factors as (B - A)(B + A + 2) = 0. Since B - A = 1, we have A + B + 2 = 0 ⇒ A + B = -2, but this contradicts the natural number requirement. Therefore:

<<<0>>>
