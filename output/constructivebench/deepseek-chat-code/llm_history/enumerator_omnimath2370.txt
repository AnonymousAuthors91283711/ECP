This problem involves calculating the ratio of the volume of a specific set to the volume of the interval [0, 1000]. The set is defined by a floor function condition. We'll enumerate the points where the floor condition changes to estimate the ratio.

```python
def main():
    total_length = 1000.0
    count = 0.0
    step = 0.01  # Small enough to approximate continuous measure
    epsilon = 1e-10  # To handle floating point precision

    for x in range(0, int(total_length / step) + 1):
        x_val = x * step
        # Compute both sides of the equation
        lhs = int(int(x_val / 2.5) / 2.5)
        rhs = int(x_val / 6.25)
        
        if abs(lhs - rhs) < epsilon:
            count += step

    ratio = count / total_length
    print(f"Estimated ratio: {ratio}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
