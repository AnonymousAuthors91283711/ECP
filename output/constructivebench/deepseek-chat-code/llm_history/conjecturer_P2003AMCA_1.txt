abbrev P2003AMCA_1_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem P2003AMCA_1 (n : ℕ) :
  (∑ k in Finset.range n, 2*(k+1)) - (∑ k in Finset.range n, 2*k + 1) = P2003AMCA_1_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=1: difference=1
n=2: difference=2
n=3: difference=3
n=4: difference=4
n=5: difference=5
n=6: difference=6
n=7: difference=7
n=8: difference=8
n=9: difference=9
n=10: difference=10
n=11: difference=11
n=12: difference=12
n=13: difference=13
n=14: difference=14
n=15: difference=15
n=16: difference=16
n=17: difference=17
n=18: difference=18
n=19: difference=19
n=20: difference=20

Based on the pattern, the difference appears to be n. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun n : ℕ => n>>>
