[write_program]
This problem asks to find all linear functions f(x) = ax + b (with a ≠ 0) such that f(x) - f⁻¹(x) = 44 for all x, where f⁻¹ is the inverse function. We'll write a program to enumerate possible (a,b) pairs that satisfy this condition.

The key steps are:
1. The inverse of f(x) = ax + b is f⁻¹(x) = (x - b)/a
2. The equation becomes: ax + b - (x - b)/a = 44
3. This must hold for all x, so we can equate coefficients

```python
def find_linear_functions():
    # We'll search for integer a values first since 44 is integer
    # a must be ≠ 0,1,-1 (since a=1 gives 0=44, and a=-1 gives 2b=44)
    for a in range(-10, 11):
        if a == 0 or a == 1 or a == -1:
            continue
        # The x coefficient must be 0: a - 1/a = 0 ⇒ a² = 1 ⇒ a=±1
        # But we excluded these cases, so no solutions exist for a≠±1
        # However, let's check the constant term anyway
        b = 44 * a / (a - 1)
        # Verify the solution
        x = 0  # test arbitrary x value
        f = lambda x: a*x + b
        finv = lambda x: (x - b)/a
        if abs(f(x) - finv(x) - 44) < 1e-6:
            print(f"Found solution: f(x) = {a}x + {b}")

    print("No linear solutions found except possibly a=±1 cases")
