This problem involves finding a functional relationship between f(19) and f(4) given multiplicative properties of f. We'll enumerate possible functions f that satisfy the given conditions to conjecture the relationship.

The key observations are:
1. The condition f(x+y) = f(x)*f(y) suggests an exponential function
2. We can parameterize f(n) = a^n for some base a > 0
3. Given f(19) = 524288*k, we can solve for a and then compute f(4)

```python
import math

def enumerate_relationships():
    # Since f(n) is multiplicative and positive, likely exponential: f(n) = a^n
    # Given f(19) = a^19 = 524288 * k
    # So a = (524288 * k)^(1/19)
    # Then f(4) = a^4 = (524288 * k)^(4/19)
    
    # Let's test with sample k values
    test_ks = [0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 10.0]
    print("Testing sample k values:")
    for k in test_ks:
        a = (524288 * k) ** (1/19)
        f4 = a ** 4
        print(f"For k = {k}: f(4) = {f4}")
    
    # The general relationship appears to be f(4) = (524288 * k)^(4/19)
    # Which simplifies to f(4) = (2^19 * k)^(4/19) = 2^4 * k^(4/19) = 16 * k^(4/19)
    print("\nConjectured general relationship:")
    print("f(4) = 16 * k^(4/19)")
