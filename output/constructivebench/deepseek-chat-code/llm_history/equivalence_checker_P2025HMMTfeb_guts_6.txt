Ground Truth Answer: 2 * sqrt 13
Proposed Answer: 5 * sqrt 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes an equilateral triangle ABC with points D on BC (BD=1, DC=4), and points E and F on rays extending from A through C and B respectively, such that D is the midpoint of EF.

2. The ground truth answer is 2√13 ≈ 7.211
3. The proposed answer is 5√2 ≈ 7.071

Key observations:
- The side length of the equilateral triangle must be 5 (since BD + DC = BC = 5)
- Using coordinate geometry or vector methods, we can calculate EF to be 2√13
- The proposed answer 5√2 is close but not equal to the correct answer
- The difference is significant enough that it can't be explained by rounding or alternative interpretations
