This problem involves counting the number of bijective functions on a finite set (Fin 20) that satisfy certain ordering constraints. The constraints are given by a mapping from each element to a set of elements, requiring that the function value at constrained elements must be less than the function value at the constraining element.

We'll approach this by:
1. Modeling the problem with small parameters first (n=3,4,5)
2. Enumerating all possible constraint configurations
3. Counting valid bijections for each configuration
4. Checking if any configuration gives exactly 2010 valid bijections

```python
from itertools import product, permutations
from math import factorial

def count_valid_bijections(n, constraints):
    count = 0
    for perm in permutations(range(n)):
        valid = True
        for i in range(n):
            for j in constraints[i]:
                if perm[j] >= perm[i]:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1
    return count

def generate_constraints(n):
    # Generate all possible constraint sets where each element can constrain any subset of others
    # This is too large for n=20, so we'll only test small n
    for constraints in product(*[[tuple(sorted(subset)) for subset in product([0,1], repeat=n)] for _ in range(n)]):
        yield [set([j for j in range(n) if constraint[j]]) for constraint in constraints]

def main():
    # Test small cases first
    for n in [3, 4, 5]:
        print(f"\nTesting n={n}")
        found = False
        for constraints in generate_constraints(n):
            cnt = count_valid_bijections(n, constraints)
            if cnt > 0:
                print(f"Constraints: {constraints} -> {cnt} bijections")
                if cnt == 2010:
                    found = True
        print(f"For n={n}, found 2010 bijections: {found}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note: For n=20, the problem space is too large to enumerate directly (20! permutations and 2^400 constraint configurations). The code above tests smaller cases to build intuition. The mathematical answer likely involves recognizing that 2010 is a special number in this context (perhaps related to binomial coefficients or derangement counts), but we can't determine that purely through enumeration for n=20.
