[write_program]
This problem involves counting the number of triples (A, B, C) of subsets of {1,2,...,n} where A is a subset of B and the complement of A is a subset of C. We'll write a Python program to enumerate these triples for small values of n to help identify the pattern.

The approach is:
1. For each n from 1 to 5 (small enough to be tractable)
2. Generate all possible subsets of {1,2,...,n}
3. Count all valid triples (A,B,C) where A⊆B and (S\A)⊆C
4. Output the counts to identify the pattern

```python
from itertools import product

def generate_subsets(n):
    """Generate all subsets of {1,2,...,n}"""
    elements = list(range(1, n+1))
    subsets = []
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        subset = {elements[i] for i in range(n) if (mask >> i) & 1}
        subsets.append(subset)
    return subsets

def count_valid_triples(n):
    """Count valid (A,B,C) triples for given n"""
    Sn = set(range(1, n+1))
    subsets = generate_subsets(n)
    count = 0
    
    for A in subsets:
        for B in subsets:
            if not A.issubset(B):
                continue
            complement_A = Sn - A
            for C in subsets:
                if complement_A.issubset(C):
                    count += 1
    return count

for n in range(1, 6):
    print(f"n={n}: {count_valid_triples(n)}")
```
