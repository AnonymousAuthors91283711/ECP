Ground Truth Answer: fun T a b c d => 3
Proposed Answer: fun (T a b c d : ℝ) => 4 * T ^ 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves logarithmic identities and simplification. The key given conditions are:
   - logₐ c = T
   - log_b d = T

2. The expression to evaluate is:
   log_(√(ab)) (cd)³ / (logₐ c + log_b d)

3. Simplifying using logarithmic identities:
   - logₐ c + log_b d = T + T = 2T
   - log_(√(ab)) (cd)³ = 3 * log_(√(ab)) (cd)
   - log_(√(ab)) (cd) = 2 * log_(ab) (cd) [since √(ab) = (ab)^(1/2)]
   - log_(ab) (cd) = (logₐ c + logₐ d)/logₐ (ab) = (T + logₐ d)/(1 + logₐ b)

4. However, from h2 (log_b d = T), we can express logₐ d = T * logₐ b
   - So numerator becomes: 3 * 2 * (T + T*logₐ b)/(1 + logₐ b) = 6T(1 + logₐ b)/(1 + logₐ b) = 6T
   - Denominator is 2T
   - Final expression: 6T/2T = 3

The ground truth answer correctly simplifies to 3, while the proposed answer of 4T² is incorrect.
