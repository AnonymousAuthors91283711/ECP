[write_program]
The problem defines a sequence where each term is generated by adding a "step" value and then incrementing by 1. The step is m/2 if m is even, or m+1 if m is odd. We need to compute the 5th term starting from 3.

We'll write a Python program to compute this sequence step by step, showing each term's calculation. The program will follow the exact definition from the problem statement.

```python
def step(m):
    return m // 2 if m % 2 == 0 else m + 1

def next_term(m):
    return m + step(m) + 1

def compute_sequence(initial, length):
    current = initial
    print(f"term1 = {current}")
    for i in range(2, length + 1):
        current = next_term(current)
        print(f"term{i} = {current}")

# Compute the sequence starting with 3 up to term5
compute_sequence(3, 5)
```
