Ground Truth Answer: (fun n : ℕ => ((-1) ^ (n + 1) + (n + 1)) / (n + 2))
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n % 2 = 1 then 1 else (n / 2 + 1) / (n / 2 + 2)
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground truth: ((-1)^(n+1) + (n+1))/(n+2)
Proposed: if n%2=1 then 1 else (n/2+1)/(n/2+2)

Let's test some values:
n=0:
- Ground truth: ((-1)^1 + 1)/2 = (0)/2 = 0
- Proposed: (0/2+1)/(0/2+2) = 1/2 ≠ 0

n=1:
- Ground truth: ((-1)^2 + 2)/3 = (1+2)/3 = 1
- Proposed: 1 (matches)

n=2:
- Ground truth: ((-1)^3 + 3)/4 = (-1+3)/4 = 2/4 = 1/2
- Proposed: (2/2+1)/(2/2+2) = 2/3 ≠ 1/2

n=3:
- Ground truth: ((-1)^4 + 4)/5 = (1+4)/5 = 1
- Proposed: 1 (matches)

The answers only match when n is odd, but differ when n is even. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
