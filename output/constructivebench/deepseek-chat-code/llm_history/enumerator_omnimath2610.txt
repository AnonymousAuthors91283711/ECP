This problem involves finding the minimal size of a set S of special vectors (non-negative components summing to 1) such that for any special vector t, there exists s in S where s is better than t (exactly two components of s are strictly greater than t's). We'll enumerate possible sets S for small dimensions to find the minimal n.

```python
from itertools import combinations, product
import numpy as np

def is_special(t):
    return all(x >= 0 for x in t) and abs(sum(t) - 1) < 1e-9

def is_better(s, t):
    count = sum(1 for si, ti in zip(s, t) if si > ti else 0
    return all(si >= 0 and ti >= 0 for si, ti in zip(s, t)) and count == 2

def generate_candidates():
    # Generate all possible special vectors with components in 0, 0.5, 1
    values = [0, 0.5, 1]
    candidates = []
    for t in product(values, repeat=3):
        if is_special(t):
            candidates.append(t)
    return candidates

def check_set(S, all_special):
    for t in all_special:
        found = False
        for s in S:
            if is_better(s, t):
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            return False
    return True

def find_minimal_set():
    candidates = generate_candidates()
    print(f"Total special vectors to consider: {len(candidates)}")
    
    # Try sets of increasing size
    for n in range(1, 5):
        print(f"Checking sets of size {n}")
        for S in combinations(candidates, n):
            if check_set(S, candidates):
                print(f"Found valid set of size {n}: {S}")
                return n
    return -1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    minimal_size = find_minimal_set()
    print(f"Minimal set size: {minimal_size}")

Let me analyze the program and its requirements:

1. Problem Analysis:
- The problem asks for the minimal size of a set S of special vectors (non-negative, sum to 1) where for any special vector t, there exists s in S that is "better" than t (exactly 2 components are larger).
- The mathematical formulation is abstract, but the Python program attempts a concrete enumeration.

2. Program Issues:
- The `is_better` function has a syntax error (missing parenthesis in list comprehension)
- The program only checks discrete values (0, 0.5, 1) which may miss the minimal set
- The output shows an error rather than results
- The program doesn't properly stream partial results
- The candidate generation is too limited (should consider more granular values)

3. Corrective Actions Needed:
- Fix the syntax error in is_better
- Expand the candidate generation to include more possible values
- Implement proper streaming of results
- Make the search more efficient by considering vector symmetries

```python

def is_special(t):
    return all(x >= 0 for x in t) and abs(sum(t) - 1) < 1e-9

def is_better(s, t):
    count = sum(1 for si, ti in zip(s, t) if si > ti)
    return all(si >= 0 and ti >= 0 for si, ti in zip(s, t)) and count == 2

def generate_candidates():
    # More granular values to capture minimal set
    values = [0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0]
    return [t for t in product(values, repeat=3) if is_special(t)]

def check_set(S, all_special):
    for t in all_special:
        if not any(is_better(s, t) for s in S):
            return False
    return True

    candidates = generate_candidates()
    print(f"Generated {len(candidates)} special vectors")

Judgement:
The problem appears to be a formal mathematical statement from Lean (a theorem prover) about finding a set of natural numbers n where certain conditions about special vectors in ℝ³ hold. The "program" section is empty, and there are no enumerated answers. This is clearly insufficient as it doesn't provide any concrete computation or enumeration.

The problem involves:
1. Defining "IsBetter" relation between vectors
2. Defining "IsSpecial" vectors (non-negative components summing to 1)
3. Finding minimal sets S of special vectors that dominate all other special vectors under the IsBetter relation

Since no program was provided to enumerate possible answers, we must reject this submission. A proper solution would need to:
1. Enumerate possible special vectors (triples of non-negative numbers summing to 1)
2. Check the domination condition (2 out of 3 components must be strictly greater)
3. Find minimal sets S that satisfy the condition

<<<False>>>

Here's a corrected Python program that enumerates possible solutions for small cases:

```python
import itertools

def is_special(t):
    return all(x >= 0 for x in t) and abs(sum(t) - 1) < 1e-9

def is_better(s, t):
    count = sum(1 for si, ti in zip(s, t) if si > ti)
    return all(si >= 0 and ti >= 0 for si, ti in zip(s, t)) and count == 2

def generate_special_vectors(step=0.1):
    """Generate all special vectors with components in steps of 0.1"""
    values = [round(x*step, 2) for x in range(0, int(1/step)+1)]
    for t in itertools.product(values, repeat=3):
        if is_special(t):
            yield t

def minimal_dominating_set(max_size=4):
    special_vectors = list(generate_special_vectors(0.1))
    print(f"Total special vectors: {len(special_vectors)}")
    
    for size in range(1, max_size+1):
        for candidate in itertools.combinations(special_vectors, size):
            dominates_all = True
            for t in special_vectors:
                if not any(is_better(s, t) for s in candidate):
                    dominates_all = False
