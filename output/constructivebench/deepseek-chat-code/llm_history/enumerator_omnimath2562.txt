[write_program]
This problem involves finding numbers n between 1 and 1000 where the difference between a(n,1000) and a(n,1) is divisible by 100. The sequence a(n,i) is defined recursively with a(n,i+1) = 2^(a(n,i)). We'll write a program to enumerate these numbers n.

The key observation is that a(n,1000) is an extremely large tower of exponents (2^2^...^n), so we need to find when this difference is divisible by 100. We'll use modular arithmetic properties to make this tractable.

```python
def main():
    # We'll compute a(n,k) mod 100 for various k
    # Since a(n,k) mod 100 depends only on a(n,k-1) mod lambda(100)=20
    # where lambda is Carmichael's function
    # We can compute the sequence modulo 20 first, then modulo 100
    
    count = 0
    for n in range(1, 1001):
        # Compute a(n,1) mod 100
        a1 = n % 100
        
        # Compute a(n,1000) mod 100 via exponentiation cycles
        # First compute a(n,2) mod 20 since 2^a(n,1) mod 100 depends on a(n,1) mod 20
        current_mod20 = n % 20
        for _ in range(999):  # from a(n,2) to a(n,1000)
            # Compute 2^current_mod20 mod 20
            # The powers of 2 modulo 20 cycle through [2,4,8,16,12,4,8,16,12,...]
            if current_mod20 == 0:
                next_mod20 = 1
            else:
                exponent = current_mod20
                if exponent >= 4:
                    exponent = (exponent - 4) % 4 + 4
                next_mod20 = pow(2, exponent, 20)
            current_mod20 = next_mod20
        
        # Now compute 2^current_mod20 mod 100
        if current_mod20 == 0:
            a1000_mod100 = 1
        else:
            exponent = current_mod20
            if exponent >= 20:
                exponent = (exponent - 20) % 20 + 20
            a1000_mod100 = pow(2, exponent, 100)
        
        if (a1000_mod100 - a1) % 100 == 0:
            print(n)
            count += 1
    
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
