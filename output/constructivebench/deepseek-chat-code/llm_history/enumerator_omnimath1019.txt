[write_program]
The problem asks to compute the average value of (a+1)*(b+1) mod 8 for a,b ranging from 0 to 7, divided by 64. We'll write a Python program to compute this sum exactly.

The approach is:
1. Iterate through all pairs (a,b) where a,b range from 0 to 7
2. For each pair, compute (a+1)*(b+1) mod 8
3. Sum all these values
4. Divide by 64 to get the average
5. Output the exact rational result

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_average():
    total = 0
    for a in range(8):
        for b in range(8):
            val = ((a + 1) * (b + 1)) % 8
            total += val
    # The average is total/64, we'll return as exact fraction
    average = Fraction(total, 64)
    print(f"Total sum: {total}")
    print(f"Average: {average}")

compute_average()
```
