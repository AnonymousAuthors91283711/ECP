Ground Truth Answer: {fun x => 2 * x}
Proposed Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ k > 0, ∀ x, f x = k * x}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is close but not exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer. The ground truth answer specifically gives the function f(x) = 2x, while the proposed answer describes a set of all linear functions f(x) = kx with k > 0. While f(x) = 2x is indeed a member of the proposed set, the proposed set is more general. The problem's functional equation actually only admits f(x) = 2x as a solution (which can be shown by solving the functional equation), so the proposed answer is too broad. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent, but the proposed answer is close as it includes the correct solution among others.
