Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Looking at the pattern in the enumerated answers, we can see that for each integer k, the area is (1/2)^(2*(-k)). For example:
- k=-1 → (1/2)^2 = 0.25
- k=-2 → (1/2)^4 = 0.0625
- k=-3 → (1/2)^6 = 0.015625
The total area is the sum of these over all k ≤ -1, which forms a geometric series with first term 1/4 and ratio 1/4.
