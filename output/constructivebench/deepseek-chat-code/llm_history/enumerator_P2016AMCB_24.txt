This problem asks for the smallest natural number n such that there are exactly 77,000 quadruples (a,b,c,d) of natural numbers where the gcd of all four numbers is 77 and the lcm of all four numbers is n. 

To approach this computationally, we'll:
1. Factorize n as n = 77 * k where 77 doesn't divide k
2. For each candidate n, count the number of quadruples (a',b',c',d') where a'=a/77 etc. that satisfy gcd(a',b',c',d')=1 and lcm(a',b',c',d')=k
3. The count of such quadruples is determined by the prime factorization of k

We'll enumerate possible k values and compute the number of quadruples for each, stopping when we find one that gives exactly 77,000 solutions.

    factors = defaultdict(int)
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors[2] += 1
        n = n // 2
    i = 3
    while i*i <= n:
        while n % i == 0:
            factors[i] += 1
            n = n // i
        i += 2
    if n > 1:
        factors[n] += 1
    return factors

    # For each prime in k's factorization, count possible exponent assignments
    # to a',b',c',d' where at least one has exponent 0 and at least one has exponent = k's exponent
    total = 1
    for p, exp in k_factors.items():
        # For each prime p^exp in k, count assignments to a',b',c',d':
        # Each must have exponent between 0 and exp, with at least one 0 and at least one exp
        # The count is (exp+1)^4 - 2*(exp)^4 + (exp-1)^4
        cnt = (exp+1)**4 - 2*(exp**4) + (exp-1)**4
        total *= cnt
    return total
