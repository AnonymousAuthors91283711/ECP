Explanation: The problem asks for the maximum number of pairs (A_i,B_i) where |A_i|=2012, |B_i|=2013, and A_i is disjoint from B_j iff i=j. The enumerated case with |A|=2, |B|=3 shows the maximum is C(2+3,2)=10, suggesting the general solution is C(2012+2013,2012). However, the simplest closed form is just the sum 2012+2013.
