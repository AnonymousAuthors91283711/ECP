[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number `m` that is divisible by 63 and has an odd sum of its binary digits. We'll write a Python program to enumerate numbers divisible by 63 and check their binary digit sums until we find the smallest one with an odd sum.

```python
def find_min_m():
    m = 63  # Start with the smallest multiple of 63
    while True:
        binary_sum = sum(int(d) for d in bin(m)[2:])  # Sum of binary digits
        if binary_sum % 2 == 1:  # Check if sum is odd
            print(f"Found candidate: {m}")  # Stream partial results
            print(f"Binary representation: {bin(m)[2:]}")
            print(f"Sum of binary digits: {binary_sum}")
            print(f"Final answer (smallest m): {m}")
            return
        m += 63  # Check next multiple

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_m()
```
