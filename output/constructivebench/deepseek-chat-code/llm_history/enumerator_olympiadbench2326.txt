The problem asks to find all non-zero integer values of k for which the quadratic equation kx² + 6x + k = 0 has two distinct real roots. For a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 to have two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be positive (D = b² - 4ac > 0).

We'll:
1. Calculate the discriminant condition: 6² - 4*k*k > 0 → 36 - 4k² > 0 → k² < 9
2. Find all non-zero integers k where -3 < k < 3 (since k² < 9)
3. Verify that for these k values, the equation indeed has two distinct roots

The Python program will enumerate all integer k values from -3 to 3 (excluding 0) and check the discriminant condition.

```python
def main():
    print("Checking k values where k² < 9 and k ≠ 0:")
    valid_ks = []
    for k in range(-3, 4):
        if k == 0:
            continue
        discriminant = 36 - 4 * k * k
        if discriminant > 0:
            print(f"k = {k} satisfies the condition (discriminant = {discriminant} > 0)")
            valid_ks.append(k)
    
    print("\nAll valid k values:", valid_ks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
