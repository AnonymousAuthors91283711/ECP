Ground Truth Answer: 175 / 1296
Proposed Answer: 34 / 1296
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating a probability where:
   - Total outcomes = 6^4 = 1296
   - The proposed favorable outcomes calculation is: 4^4 - 3^4 - (5^4 - 4^4)

2. Calculating the favorable outcomes:
   - 4^4 = 256
   - 3^4 = 81
   - 5^4 = 625
   - So the expression becomes: 256 - 81 - (625 - 256) = 175 - 369 = -194
   - This negative result is clearly incorrect for counting favorable outcomes

3. The ground truth answer is 175/1296, which suggests the correct favorable count is 175
   - This matches the first part of the proposed calculation (256 - 81 = 175)
   - The subtraction of (5^4 - 4^4) appears to be an error

4. The proposed answer 34/1296 doesn't match either the correct calculation or the incorrect one

The proposed answer is completely wrong - it doesn't match either the correct calculation or the incorrect calculation shown in the problem statement.
