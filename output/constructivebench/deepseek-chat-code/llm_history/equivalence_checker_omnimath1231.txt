Ground Truth Answer: -3 / 2
Proposed Answer: 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a quadratic polynomial P(x) = x² + bx + c
2. We have two conditions:
   - P(P(1)) = 0
   - P(P(2)) = 0
3. And the condition that P(P(1)) ≠ P(P(2))
4. We're asked to find P(0), which would be c since P(0) = 0² + b*0 + c = c

The ground truth answer is -3/2, meaning c = -1.5
The proposed answer is 1, meaning c = 1

Let's verify which is correct:

From P(P(1)) = 0:
P(1) = 1 + b + c
P(P(1)) = (1+b+c)² + b(1+b+c) + c = 0

From P(P(2)) = 0:
P(2) = 4 + 2b + c
P(P(2)) = (4+2b+c)² + b(4+2b+c) + c = 0

This gives us two equations. Solving them simultaneously (subtracting one from another) would lead to solutions where c = -3/2 is indeed valid, while c = 1 is not a solution that satisfies both equations.

Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect.
