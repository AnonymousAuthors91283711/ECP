Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find natural numbers A and B where:
   - B = A + 1
   - The equation B² + 2B + 3 = A² + 2A + 3 holds
   - We need the minimal sum A + B that satisfies these conditions

2. Simplifying the equation:
   B² + 2B = A² + 2A
   (A+1)² + 2(A+1) = A² + 2A
   A² + 2A + 1 + 2A + 2 = A² + 2A
   4A + 3 = 2A
   2A = -3
   A = -1.5

3. However, A must be a natural number (ℕ), so there are no natural number solutions where A + 1 = B and the equation holds.

4. The ground truth answer is 13, which appears to be incorrect based on the algebra. The proposed answer is 0, which would correspond to A = 0, B = 1, but:
   For A=0, B=1:
   LHS = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
   RHS = 0 + 0 + 3 = 3
   Which doesn't satisfy the equation.

5. Neither answer satisfies the given conditions, but they are different values.
