This problem involves counting the number of 7-tuples of positive integers (t0,t1,...,t6) that satisfy a system of linear equations. We'll enumerate all possible solutions by iterating through possible values of t0 and t1, then computing the other variables based on the equations.

The approach:
1. Iterate t0 from 1 to a reasonable bound (we'll use 20)
2. For each t0, iterate t1 from 1 to a reasonable bound (20)
3. Compute t2 + t3 from t0 + t1
4. Compute t4 + t5 from t0 + t2 (but we need to express t2 in terms of known variables)
5. Solve the system of equations to express all variables in terms of t0 and t1
6. Check that all variables are positive integers
7. Count valid solutions

```python
def solve():
    count = 0
    max_t0 = 20  # reasonable upper bound for enumeration
    
    for t0 in range(1, max_t0 + 1):
        for t1 in range(1, max_t0 + 1):
            # From t0 + t1 = t2 + t3
            sum_t2_t3 = t0 + t1
            # From t0 + t2 = t4 + t5
            # From t0 + t4 = t6 + t1
            # From t0 + t6 = t3 + t5
            
            # Solve the system:
            # Let's express all variables in terms of t0 and t1
            # We can parameterize t2 = a, then t3 = sum_t2_t3 - a
            for a in range(1, sum_t2_t3):
                t2 = a
                t3 = sum_t2_t3 - a
                
                sum_t4_t5 = t0 + t2
                for b in range(1, sum_t4_t5):
                    t4 = b
                    t5 = sum_t4_t5 - b
                    
                    t6 = t0 + t4 - t1
                    if t6 <= 0:
                        continue
                    
                    # Check last equation t0 + t6 == t3 + t5
                    if t0 + t6 == t3 + t5:
                        count += 1
                        print(f"Solution {count}: ({t0}, {t1}, {t2}, {t3}, {t4}, {t5}, {t6})")
    
    print(f"Total number of solutions: {count}")

solve()
```
