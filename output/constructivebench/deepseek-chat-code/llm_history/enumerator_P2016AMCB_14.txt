This problem asks for the smallest positive real number S that can be expressed as a/(1-r) where a and r are real numbers with |r|<1 and a*r=1. We need to enumerate possible values of S by solving the system of equations.

The approach is:
1. Express a in terms of r from a*r=1 (a=1/r)
2. Substitute into S = a/(1-r) to get S = 1/(r*(1-r))
3. Find the minimum of this function for r âˆˆ (-1,1)\{0}

```python
import math

def find_min_S():
    min_S = float('inf')
    best_r = 0
    
    # Sample r values in (-1,1) excluding 0, with finer sampling near critical points
    for i in range(-900, 900):
        r = i / 1000
        if r == 0:
            continue
        if abs(r) >= 1:
            continue
        
        a = 1 / r
        S = a / (1 - r)
        
        # Check if S is positive and smaller than current minimum
        if S > 0 and S < min_S:
            min_S = S
            best_r = r
            print(f"Found new minimum S={S} at r={r}")
    
    # After scanning, output the minimal S found
    print(f"\nFinal minimal S found: {min_S} at r={best_r}")

find_min_S()
```
