This problem appears to be about finding numbers where the sum of their digits equals a given value. The Lean code suggests we need to find numbers N where the sum of their digits (in base 10) equals some function P2019AIMEI_1_answer N. Since the example shows 123456789 has digit sum 45, we'll enumerate numbers and their digit sums to find patterns.

The Python program will:
1. Enumerate numbers from 1 to 1000
2. Calculate their digit sums
3. Print numbers and their digit sums
4. Look for patterns where the digit sum equals some function of the number

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

print("Numbers and their digit sums:")
for n in range(1, 1001):
    ds = digit_sum(n)
    # Print numbers where digit sum equals the number itself (like 1) or other interesting cases
    if ds == n or n % 100 == 0:  # Print every 100th number to show progress
        print(f"{n}: {ds}")

# Special cases mentioned in the problem
print("\nSpecial case verification:")
test_num = 123456789
print(f"{test_num}: {digit_sum(test_num)}")
```
