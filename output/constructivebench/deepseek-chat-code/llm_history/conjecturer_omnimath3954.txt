Found valid function: f(x) = 0*x + 0
Found valid function: f(x) = 1*x + 0

Testing constant functions f(x) = c:
Found valid function: f(x) = 0

Finished testing candidate functions.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
From the enumerated answers and functional equation analysis, the valid solutions appear to be linear functions f(x) = x and f(x) = 0. The constant function f(x) = 0 is a special case of the linear solution. The functional equation suggests these are the only possible solutions.
