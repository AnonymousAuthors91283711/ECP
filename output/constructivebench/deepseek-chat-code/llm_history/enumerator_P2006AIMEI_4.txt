The problem asks for the number of trailing zeros in the product of factorials from 1! to 100!, modulo 1000. The number of trailing zeros is determined by the minimum of the exponents of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization. Since factorials have more factors of 2 than 5, we only need to count the exponent of 5.

We'll calculate the exponent of 5 in the product by summing the exponents of 5 in each factorial from 1 to 100. For each factorial k!, the exponent of 5 is floor(k/5) + floor(k/25) + floor(k/125) + ... 

Here's a Python program to compute this:

```python
def count_trailing_zeros():
    total = 0
    for k in range(1, 101):
        exponent = 0
        power = 5
        while power <= k:
            exponent += k // power
            power *= 5
        total += exponent
    print(f"Total trailing zeros: {total}")
    print(f"Answer modulo 1000: {total % 1000}")

count_trailing_zeros()
```

The program calculates the total number of trailing zeros by:
1. Iterating through each number from 1 to 100
2. For each number, calculating its contribution to the 5's exponent by summing floor(k/5^i) for i=1,2,... until 5^i exceeds k
3. Summing all these contributions
4. Printing both the total and the result modulo 1000

The output will show the exact count of trailing zeros and the required answer modulo 1000.
