[write_program]
This problem involves analyzing a recursive sequence x(k) where each term depends on whether the previous term is divisible by a. We need to find the greatest power of a that divides any term in the sequence. Let's write a Python program to explore this behavior for small coprime values of a and d.

The program will:
1. Choose sample coprime pairs (a,d)
2. Generate the sequence x(k) according to the given rules
3. Track the highest power of a dividing any term
4. Output the sequence and maximum power found for each pair

```python
def compute_max_power(a, d, max_terms=1000):
    """Compute the maximum power of a dividing any term in sequence x(k)"""
    x = 1  # x(1) = 1
    max_power = 0
    
    for k in range(1, max_terms + 1):
        # Check current term's divisibility by a
        power = 0
        temp = x
        while temp % a == 0 and temp != 0:
            power += 1
            temp = temp // a
        
        if power > max_power:
            max_power = power
            print(f"a={a}, d={d}: new max power {max_power} at k={k}, x={x}")
        
        # Compute next term
        if x % a == 0:
            x = x // a
        else:
            x = x + d
    
    print(f"Final max power for a={a}, d={d}: {max_power}")
    return max_power

# Test with small coprime pairs
coprime_pairs = [(2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (2,5), (3,5)]
for a, d in coprime_pairs:
    compute_max_power(a, d)
```
