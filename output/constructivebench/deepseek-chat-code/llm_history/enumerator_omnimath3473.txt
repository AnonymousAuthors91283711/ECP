[write_program]
This appears to be a simple arithmetic problem asking to compute 110% of 500. The Python program should calculate and output this value exactly. Since the problem involves rational numbers, we'll use Python's fractions module to maintain exact arithmetic.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    # Calculate 110% of 500 using exact rational arithmetic
    result = Fraction(110, 100) * 500
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
