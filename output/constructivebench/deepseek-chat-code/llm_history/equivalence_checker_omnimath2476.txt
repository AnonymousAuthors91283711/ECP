Ground Truth Answer: 773
Proposed Answer: 603
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for natural numbers a and b that are coprime, where:
   - 100*a + b equals some answer (omnimath2476_answer)
   - a = isosceles/gcd(isosceles, total)
   - b = total/gcd(isosceles, total)
   - n = 2020
   - total = n(n-1)(n-2)/6
   - isosceles = n(n-1)

2. Calculating the values:
   - n = 2020
   - total = 2020*2019*2018/6 = 1371358140
   - isosceles = 2020*2019 = 4078380
   - gcd(isosceles, total) = gcd(4078380, 1371358140) = 4078380/2018*2 = 2020 (since 2018 = 2*1009)

3. Calculating a and b:
   - a = isosceles/gcd = 4078380/2020 = 2019
   - b = total/gcd = 1371358140/2020 = 678890.198... (not an integer)

Wait, this suggests the ground truth answer might be incorrect since b must be an integer. However, the proposed answer 603 would correspond to a=6, b=3, which doesn't match our calculations.

The ground truth answer 773 would correspond to a=7, b=73, but:
- 7 = 2019? No
- 73 = 678890? No

Neither answer matches the correct calculations. However, the proposed answer (603) is completely unrelated to the correct values, while the ground truth answer (773) might be a typo or from a different version of the problem.
