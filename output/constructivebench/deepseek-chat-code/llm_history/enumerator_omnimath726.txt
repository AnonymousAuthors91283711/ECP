[write_program]
This problem involves finding the value of a polynomial P evaluated at 3, given specific conditions about its behavior. The polynomial satisfies a particular functional equation and has a known value at x=-1. We'll write a program to find possible polynomials P that satisfy these conditions and compute P(3).

The functional equation suggests P is quadratic (degree ≤ 2), since it's expressed in terms of x². We'll represent P as ax² + bx + c and solve for the coefficients using the given conditions.

```python
import numpy as np

# We'll represent P(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c
# From the functional equation hP, we know:
# P(x) = P(0) + P(1)*x + P(2)*x^2
# But P(0) = c, P(1) = a + b + c, P(2) = 4a + 2b + c
# So the equation becomes:
# a*x^2 + b*x + c = c + (a+b+c)*x + (4a+2b+c)*x^2

# Comparing coefficients:
# x^2: a = 4a + 2b + c
# x: b = a + b + c
# constant: c = c (always true)

# From x coefficient: 0 = a + c => c = -a
# From x^2 coefficient: 0 = 3a + 2b + c = 3a + 2b - a = 2a + 2b => b = -a

# So P(x) = a*x^2 - a*x - a
# Now use P(-1) = 1:
# a*(-1)^2 - a*(-1) - a = 1 => a + a - a = 1 => a = 1

# Therefore P(x) = x^2 - x - 1
# Now compute P(3):
p = lambda x: x**2 - x - 1
print(f"P(3) = {p(3)}")
```
