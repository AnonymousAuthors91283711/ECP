This problem involves calculating the probability that the sum of two dice with faces [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13] is a prime number. We'll enumerate all possible pairs, compute their sums, check for primality, and calculate the probability.

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    faces = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
    total_outcomes = 0
    prime_sums = 0
    
    for i in range(len(faces)):
        for j in range(len(faces)):
            total_outcomes += 1
            s = faces[i] + faces[j]
            if is_prime(s):
                prime_sums += 1
                print(f"Prime sum found: {faces[i]} + {faces[j]} = {s}")
    
    probability = prime_sums / total_outcomes
    print(f"\nTotal outcomes: {total_outcomes}")
    print(f"Prime sums: {prime_sums}")
    print(f"Probability: {probability}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
