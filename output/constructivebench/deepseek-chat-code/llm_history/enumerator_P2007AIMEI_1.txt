[write_program]
This problem asks for the count of positive integers k where k² < 1,000,000 and 24 divides k². We'll write a Python program to enumerate and count these numbers efficiently.

Key observations:
1. 24 = 8 × 3, so k² must be divisible by both 8 and 3
2. For divisibility by 8, k must be even (since odd squares ≡1 mod8)
3. For divisibility by 3, k must be divisible by 3 (since squares ≡0 or 1 mod3)
4. Therefore, k must be divisible by 6 (LCM of 2 and 3)

We'll iterate through multiples of 6 up to √1,000,000 (1000) and count those where k² < 1,000,000.

```python
def count_valid_numbers():
    count = 0
    max_k = 10**6
    # k must be divisible by 6 (from observations)
    for k in range(6, int(max_k**0.5) + 1, 6):
        if k*k < max_k:
            count += 1
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

count_valid_numbers()
```
