[write_program]
This problem asks for the greatest integer x such that there exist integers H, M, T satisfying H*M²*T = H + 2M + T. We'll write a program to search for such solutions by enumerating possible values of H, M, T within reasonable bounds and checking the condition.

The approach:
1. Iterate over possible values of H, M, T in a reasonable range (-100 to 100)
2. For each combination, check if H*M²*T equals H + 2M + T
3. Track all valid x values and find the maximum

```python
def find_solutions():
    max_x = None
    solutions = []
    # Search in a reasonable range
    for H in range(-100, 101):
        for M in range(-100, 101):
            if M == 0:  # Avoid division by zero
                continue
            for T in range(-100, 101):
                left = H * M * M * T
                right = H + 2 * M + T
                if left == right:
                    x = left
                    solutions.append((H, M, T, x))
                    if max_x is None or x > max_x:
                        max_x = x
                        print(f"New max found: H={H}, M={M}, T={T}, x={x}")
    
    print("\nAll solutions found:")
    for sol in solutions:
        print(f"H={sol[0]}, M={sol[1]}, T={sol[2]}, x={sol[3]}")
    
    if max_x is not None:
        print(f"\nGreatest x found: {max_x}")
    else:
        print("No solutions found in the search range")

find_solutions()
```
