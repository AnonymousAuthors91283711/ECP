This problem involves finding all real numbers x that satisfy the equation x = sum from n=1 to infinity of (-1)^(n+1) * x^n. The series is an alternating series, and we need to find its sum and then solve for x.

We'll approach this by:
1. Recognizing the series as a geometric series
2. Finding its sum when it converges
3. Solving the resulting equation x = x/(1+x)
4. Checking convergence conditions

The program will test small rational values and exact solutions to find candidates.

```python
def main():
    # Test small rational values
    for numerator in range(-10, 11):
        for denominator in range(1, 11):
            if denominator == 0:
                continue
            x = numerator / denominator
            try:
                # Compute partial sum (100 terms should be sufficient for approximation)
                partial_sum = 0.0
                for n in range(1, 101):
                    term = ((-1) ** (n + 1)) * (x ** n)
                    partial_sum += term
                
                # Check if x â‰ˆ partial_sum
                if abs(x - partial_sum) < 1e-6:
                    print(f"Found candidate: x = {x}")
            except OverflowError:
                continue
    
    # Check exact solutions
    # The equation reduces to x = x/(1+x) when |x|<1
    # Solutions are x=0 and x=-0.5 (but need to check convergence)
    print("Checking exact solutions:")
    for x in [0.0, -0.5]:
        partial_sum = 0.0
        converges = True
        for n in range(1, 101):
            term = ((-1) ** (n + 1)) * (x ** n)
            partial_sum += term
            if abs(term) > 1e6:  # Detect divergence
                converges = False
                break
        
        if converges and abs(x - partial_sum) < 1e-6:
            print(f"Exact solution found: x = {x}")

    main()
