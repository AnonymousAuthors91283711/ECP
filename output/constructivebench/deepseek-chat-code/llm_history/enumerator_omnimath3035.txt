[write_program]
This problem involves finding a rational function `z` in terms of integers `x` and `y` that satisfies the equation `2x - 3z = 5y`. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible rational expressions for `z` and check which ones satisfy the equation for small integer values of `x` and `y`.

The approach will be:
1. Test simple linear forms for `z` in terms of `x` and `y`
2. For each candidate, verify the equation with small integer values
3. Print successful candidates immediately when found

```python
def test_z_candidate(a, b):
    """Test if z = (a*x + b*y)/c satisfies the equation for small integers."""
    # We'll test with c=3 since that's the denominator in the original equation
    c = 3
    for x in range(-5, 6):
        for y in range(-5, 6):
            z = (a * x + b * y) / c
            lhs = 2 * x - 3 * z
            rhs = 5 * y
            if not abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-9:  # Account for floating point precision
                return False
    return True

# Test simple linear combinations
print("Testing possible forms for z = (a*x + b*y)/3:")
for a in range(-5, 6):
    for b in range(-5, 6):
        if test_z_candidate(a, b):
            print(f"Found valid form: z = ({a}x + {b}y)/3")

# After testing, we find the solution is z = (2x - 5y)/3
print("\nThe solution appears to be:")
print("z = (2x - 5y)/3")
```
