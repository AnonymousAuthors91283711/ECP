This problem involves finding the greatest natural number `n` that can be obtained through a specific recursive function construction. The function `f` grows exponentially for the first 16 steps, then another function `g` is defined based on `f(16)` with a recursive difference rule. We'll enumerate possible `g` values up to a reasonable threshold to find the maximum `n = g(16)`.

```python
def compute_max_g16():
    # First compute f(k) for k <= 16 (exponential growth)
    f = [1]  # f[0] = 1
    for k in range(16):
        f.append(2 * f[-1])
    
    g16_candidates = set()
    
    # We'll model g recursively, tracking possible values at each step
    # Since g grows combinatorially, we'll limit to depth 16
    current_values = {f[16]}  # g starts at f(16)
    
    for m in range(16):  # compute up to g(16)
        next_values = set()
        for g_val in current_values:
            # Generate all possible g(m+1) = g(a) - g(b) where a,b <= m
            # Since we don't track history, we'll use current_values for a,b
            for a_val in current_values:
                for b_val in current_values:
                    if a_val >= b_val:  # ensure non-negative result
                        next_val = a_val - b_val
                        if next_val >= 0:
                            next_values.add(next_val)
        current_values.update(next_values)
        print(f"At m={m+1}, possible g values: {sorted(current_values)}")
    
    max_g16 = max(current_values)
    print(f"\nMaximum possible g(16): {max_g16}")
    return max_g16

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_max_g16()
```

The program first computes the exponential growth of `f` up to 16 steps, then models the recursive definition of `g`. At each step `m`, it computes all possible values of `g(m+1)` by subtracting pairs of previous values. The maximum value found for `g(16)` is printed as the final result. The intermediate steps show the growing set of possible values at each stage.
