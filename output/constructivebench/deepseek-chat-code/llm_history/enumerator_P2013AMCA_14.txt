[write_program]
This problem involves finding real numbers x, y, z such that the sequence of logarithms forms an arithmetic sequence. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible x values and verify the arithmetic sequence condition.

The approach:
1. Convert the problem into linear equations using logarithm properties
2. For each candidate x, compute the required common difference
3. Check if the sequence remains arithmetic with this difference
4. Output valid x values as they're found

```python
import math

def is_arithmetic(sequence):
    if len(sequence) < 2:
        return True
    d = sequence[1] - sequence[0]
    for i in range(1, len(sequence)-1):
        if not math.isclose(sequence[i+1] - sequence[i], d):
            return False
    return True

def log_base(b, x):
    return math.log(x) / math.log(b)

def find_arithmetic_x():
    log12 = math.log(12)
    # Fixed terms in the sequence
    first = log_base(162, 12)
    last = log_base(1250, 12)
    
    # We'll test x values around geometric mean of 162 and 1250
    # since in geometric sequence, logs form arithmetic sequence
    geometric_mean = math.sqrt(162 * 1250)
    start = int(geometric_mean * 0.9)
    end = int(geometric_mean * 1.1)
    
    for x in range(start, end + 1):
        try:
            seq = [
                first,
                log_base(x, 12),
                log_base(x*x/162, 12),  # y candidate assuming arithmetic
                log_base(x*x*x/(162*162), 12),  # z candidate
                last
            ]
            if is_arithmetic(seq):
                print(f"Found x = {x}")
                # Verify the full sequence
                d = seq[1] - seq[0]
                y = 12 ** (seq[1] + d)
                z = 12 ** (seq[2] + d)
                full_seq = [first, log_base(x,12), log_base(y,12), log_base(z,12), last]
                if is_arithmetic(full_seq):
                    print(f"Valid solution: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")
                    return x
        except ValueError:
            continue
    
    print("No solution found in tested range")
    return None

find_arithmetic_x()
