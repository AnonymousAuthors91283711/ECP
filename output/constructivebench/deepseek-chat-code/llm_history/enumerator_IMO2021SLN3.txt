[write_program]
This problem asks to find all positive integers n where the divisors of n can be permuted such that every prefix sum of the permutation is a perfect square. We'll write a Python program to enumerate such numbers up to a reasonable threshold.

The approach:
1. For each n, generate its divisors
2. Try all permutations of divisors (for small n)
3. Check if all prefix sums are perfect squares
4. Output n when found

```python
import math
from itertools import permutations

def is_perfect_square(x):
    s = int(math.isqrt(x))
    return s * s == x

def get_divisors(n):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(n // i)
    return sorted(divisors)

max_n = 100  # Reasonable threshold for demonstration
found = []

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    divisors = get_divisors(n)
    # Skip if sum of divisors isn't square (necessary condition)
    total = sum(divisors)
    if not is_perfect_square(total):
        continue
    
    # Try all permutations for small n (n <= 12)
    if len(divisors) > 7:  # Skip large cases due to permutation explosion
        continue
        
    for perm in permutations(divisors):
        valid = True
        prefix_sum = 0
        for num in perm:
            prefix_sum += num
            if not is_perfect_square(prefix_sum):
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            found.append(n)
            print(f"Found: {n} with permutation {perm}")
            break

print("\nAll found numbers up to threshold:", sorted(set(found)))
```
