[write_program]
The problem asks for the count of prime numbers between 2^8 (256) and 9^8 (43046721) where:
1. All digits are between 2 and 9 inclusive
2. All digits are distinct
3. The number is prime

We'll write a Python program to enumerate such numbers efficiently by:
1. Generating numbers with distinct digits from 2-9
2. Checking primality
3. Counting those in the range

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]:
        if n % p == 0:
            return n == p
    d = n - 1
    s = 0
    while d % 2 == 0:
        d //= 2
        s += 1
    for a in [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]:
        if a >= n:
            continue
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(s - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False
    return True

def generate_numbers(length, digits, current=0, used_digits=set()):
    if length == 0:
        yield current
        return
    for d in digits:
        if d not in used_digits:
            yield from generate_numbers(length - 1, digits, current * 10 + d, used_digits | {d})

count = 0
digits = [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

for length in range(1, 9):  # Numbers from 1 to 8 digits (9^8 has 9 digits but we stop at 8)
    for num in generate_numbers(length, digits):
        if 256 <= num <= 43046721 and is_prime(num):
            print(num)
            count += 1

print("Total count:", count)
```
