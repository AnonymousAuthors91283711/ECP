This problem asks for all real polynomials P where for all non-zero real x, P(x)^2 + P(1/x)^2 = P(x^2)*P(1/x^2). We'll enumerate low-degree polynomials to find patterns.

The approach:
1. Consider polynomials up to degree 4 (higher degrees become complex)
2. For each degree, generate general form with coefficients
3. Test the functional equation at specific x values to constrain coefficients
4. Output valid polynomials that satisfy the equation

```python
import numpy as np
from itertools import product

def test_poly(coeffs, x=2.0):
    """Test if polynomial satisfies the functional equation at x."""
    P = np.poly1d(coeffs)
    x_inv = 1/x
    x_sq = x**2
    x_sq_inv = 1/x_sq
    
    lhs = P(x)**2 + P(x_inv)**2
    rhs = P(x_sq) * P(x_sq_inv)
    
    return abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-8

def generate_and_test(max_degree=4):
    """Generate and test polynomials up to given degree."""
    found = set()
    
    for degree in range(max_degree + 1):
        # Generate coefficient combinations (-2 to 2 range sufficient for patterns)
        for coeffs in product([-2, -1, 0, 1, 2], repeat=degree+1):
            if coeffs[-1] == 0:  # Skip if not actually this degree
                continue
                
            # Test at multiple x values to be thorough
            valid = True
            for x_test in [0.5, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0]:
                if not test_poly(coeffs, x_test):
                    valid = False
                    break
                    
            if valid:
                # Normalize by leading coefficient
                normalized = np.poly1d(coeffs) / coeffs[0]
                poly_str = str(normalized).replace('\n', '').replace(' ', '')
                if poly_str not in found:
                    found.add(poly_str)
                    print(f"Found: {poly_str}")
    
    print("\nPotential solutions found:")
    for p in sorted(found):
        print(p)
