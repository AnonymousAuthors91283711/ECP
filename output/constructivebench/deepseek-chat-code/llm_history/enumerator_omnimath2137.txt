[write_program]
The problem asks for the sum of the number of digits in the base-4 representation of all numbers from 1 to 2013. We'll write a Python program to compute this by converting each number to base-4 and counting its digits.

```python
def count_digits_base4(n):
    """Count the number of digits in the base-4 representation of n."""
    count = 0
    while n > 0:
        count += 1
        n = n // 4
    return count

total = 0
for i in range(1, 2014):  # 1 to 2013 inclusive
    digits = count_digits_base4(i)
    total += digits
    # Print partial results every 100 numbers for observation
    if i % 100 == 0:
        print(f"After {i} numbers: sum = {total}")

print(f"Final sum for 1 to 2013: {total}")
```
