abbrev omnimath2796_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2796 :
  ∃ p q : ℝ, (∀ r : ℝ, (∃ x₁ x₂ : ℝ, x₁ ≠ x₂ ∧ x₁ < 0 ∧ x₂ < 0 ∧ x₁ * x₂ = r + 87 ∧ x₁ + x₂ = r + 7) ↔ p < r ∧ r < q) ∧
  p^2 + q^2 = omnimath2796_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No valid p and q found. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the problem statement and the fact that no valid p and q were found in the enumeration, this suggests the condition is never satisfied. The answer should be a real number representing p² + q² for non-existent p, q. The most natural choice is 0 since it represents the sum of squares of two undefined values.
