[write_program]
The problem asks for the product of the last two digits of the smallest N-digit number divisible by 33. We'll write a Python program to compute this for small values of T (number of digits).

Key observations:
1. The smallest N-digit number is 10^(T-1)
2. We find the next multiple of 33 after this number
3. We extract the last two digits and compute their product

```python
def find_product(T):
    min_num = 10 ** (T - 1)
    remainder = min_num % 33
    if remainder == 0:
        N = min_num
    else:
        N = min_num + (33 - remainder)
    
    last_two_digits = N % 100
    digit1 = last_two_digits % 10
    digit2 = last_two_digits // 10
    return digit1 * digit2

# Test for T from 2 to 10 digits
for T in range(2, 11):
    product = find_product(T)
    print(f"T={T}: Product of last two digits = {product}")

# The program will output the products for numbers with 2 to 10 digits
# The results show a pattern that can help conjecture the general answer
```
