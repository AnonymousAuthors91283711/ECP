[write_program]
This problem involves finding a list of digits (0-9) such that when processed through the given fold operation, the result is -2013. The fold operation starts with 0 and for each digit d, multiplies the accumulator by -4 and adds d. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible digit sequences and check which ones satisfy the condition.

The approach will be:
1. Enumerate all possible digit sequences of increasing length
2. For each sequence, apply the fold operation
3. Print sequences that result in -2013
4. Stop when we find the minimal length sequence (since longer sequences would be less interesting)

```python
def find_sequences():
    target = -2013
    max_length = 10  # Reasonable upper bound for sequence length
    
    for length in range(1, max_length + 1):
        from itertools import product
        for digits in product(range(10), repeat=length):
            accumulator = 0
            for d in digits:
                accumulator = accumulator * (-4) + d
            if accumulator == target:
                print(digits)
                return  # Return after first found solution (minimal length)
    
    print("No sequence found up to length", max_length)

find_sequences()
```
