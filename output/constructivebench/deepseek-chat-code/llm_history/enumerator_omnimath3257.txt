[write_program]
This problem appears to be about finding the maximum number of binary vectors (with entries 0 or 1) that can lie in a k-dimensional subspace of ℝⁿ. We'll write a program to enumerate possible values for small n and k to help conjecture the general formula.

The approach will be:
1. For small values of n (up to 5)
2. For each k from 1 to n
3. Generate all possible k-dimensional subspaces (represented by basis vectors)
4. Count the number of binary vectors in each subspace
5. Track the maximum count found

```python
import itertools
import numpy as np
from numpy.linalg import matrix_rank

def max_binary_vectors_in_subspace(n, k):
    # Generate all binary vectors of length n
    binary_vectors = list(itertools.product([0,1], repeat=n))
    
    max_count = 0
    
    # Try all combinations of k linearly independent vectors as basis
    # We limit to small cases due to combinatorial explosion
    for basis in itertools.combinations(binary_vectors, k):
        basis_matrix = np.array(basis, dtype=int).T
        if matrix_rank(basis_matrix) < k:
            continue  # Skip if not linearly independent
        
        # The subspace is all linear combinations of basis vectors
        # We need to find which binary vectors are in this subspace
        count = 0
        for vec in binary_vectors:
            # Check if vec is in the span of basis_matrix
            try:
                coeffs = np.linalg.solve(basis_matrix, np.array(vec))
                if all(c.is_integer() for c in coeffs):
                    count += 1
            except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
                continue
        
        if count > max_count:
            max_count = count
            print(f"n={n}, k={k}: new max count {max_count}")
    
    return max_count

# Run for small values of n and k
for n in range(1, 5):
    for k in range(1, n+1):
        print(f"\n=== n={n}, k={k} ===")
        result = max_binary_vectors_in_subspace(n, k)
        print(f"Final maximum for n={n}, k={k}: {result}")
```
