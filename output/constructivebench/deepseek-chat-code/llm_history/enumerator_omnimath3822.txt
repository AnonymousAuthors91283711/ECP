[write_program]
This problem asks for the longest sequence of distinct positions on a 5x5 chessboard where consecutive positions are connected by a generalized knight's move (moving 1 in one direction and 3 in the other, or vice versa). We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible sequences and find the maximum length.

The approach will be:
1. Represent the 5x5 board as coordinates (0-4, 0-4)
2. Generate all possible knight moves from each position
3. Use backtracking to find the longest non-repeating path
4. Track and output the maximum length found

```python
def main():
    size = 5
    # All possible knight moves (dx, dy) combinations
    moves = [(1,3), (1,-3), (3,1), (3,-1), (-1,3), (-1,-3), (-3,1), (-3,-1)]
    
    max_length = 0
    
    def is_valid(x, y):
        return 0 <= x < size and 0 <= y < size
    
    def backtrack(path):
        nonlocal max_length
        current = path[-1]
        found_extension = False
        
        for dx, dy in moves:
            nx, ny = current[0] + dx, current[1] + dy
            if is_valid(nx, ny) and (nx, ny) not in path:
                found_extension = True
                new_path = path.copy()
                new_path.append((nx, ny))
                if len(new_path) > max_length:
                    max_length = len(new_path)
                    print(f"New max length: {max_length}")
                backtrack(new_path)
        
        if not found_extension and len(path) > max_length:
            max_length = len(path)
            print(f"New max length: {max_length}")
    
    # Start from each possible position
    for x in range(size):
        for y in range(size):
            print(f"Starting from ({x}, {y})")
            backtrack([(x, y)])
    
    print(f"Final maximum length found: {max_length}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
