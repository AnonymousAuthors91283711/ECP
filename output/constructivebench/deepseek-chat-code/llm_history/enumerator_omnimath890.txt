[write_program]
This problem asks for the greatest natural number `a` such that there exist positive integers `b` and `c` satisfying the equation:
`a + b + c = gcd(a,b) + gcd(b,c) + gcd(c,a) + 120`

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of `a` and find the maximum one that satisfies the condition for some `b,c`. We'll limit our search to reasonable bounds.

```python
import math

def find_max_a():
    max_a = 0
    # We'll search up to a=200 since gcd terms reduce the RHS
    for a in range(1, 201):
        found = False
        # Try b values up to a to avoid duplicate checks
        for b in range(1, a + 1):
            # The equation can be rearranged to express c in terms of a,b
            # c = gcd(a,b) + gcd(b,c) + gcd(c,a) + 120 - a - b
            # We'll try c values up to a reasonable bound
            for c in range(1, 201):
                gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
                gcd_bc = math.gcd(b, c)
                gcd_ca = math.gcd(c, a)
                lhs = a + b + c
                rhs = gcd_ab + gcd_bc + gcd_ca + 120
                if lhs == rhs:
                    print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
                    max_a = max(max_a, a)
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break
    print(f"Maximum a found: {max_a}")

find_max_a()
```
