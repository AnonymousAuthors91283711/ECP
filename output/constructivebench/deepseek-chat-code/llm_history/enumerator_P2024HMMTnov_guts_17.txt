The problem asks for the number of subsets S of a 4×4 grid (Fin 4 × Fin 4) such that for every pair (i,j) in a 5×5 grid (Fin 5 × Fin 5), there exists some (k,l) in S where k is either i or i-1, and l is either j or j-1. This means each point in the 5×5 grid must be "covered" by one of its four possible neighbors in the 4×4 grid.

We'll enumerate all possible subsets of the 4×4 grid (2^16 possibilities) and count how many satisfy the coverage condition. For efficiency, we'll represent the grid as bits and check coverage systematically.

```python
from itertools import product

def solve():
    size = 4
    total = 0
    
    # Precompute all possible (k,l) pairs that can cover each (i,j)
    coverage = {}
    for i in range(5):
        for j in range(5):
            cover = []
            for k in [i-1, i]:
                for l in [j-1, j]:
                    if 0 <= k < size and 0 <= l < size:
                        cover.append((k, l))
            coverage[(i,j)] = cover
    
    # Iterate through all possible subsets (represented as bitmask)
    for mask in range(1 << (size*size)):
        s = set()
        for k in range(size):
            for l in range(size):
                if mask & (1 << (k*size + l)):
                    s.add((k, l))
        
        # Check if all (i,j) are covered
        valid = True
        for (i,j), cover in coverage.items():
            if not any((k,l) in s for (k,l) in cover):
                valid = False
                break
        
        if valid:
            total += 1
            print(f"Found valid subset #{total}")
    
    print(f"Total valid subsets: {total}")

solve()
```
