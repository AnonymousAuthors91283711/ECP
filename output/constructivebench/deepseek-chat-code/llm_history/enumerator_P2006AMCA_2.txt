[write_program]
This problem involves defining a function `tensor(x,y) = x^3 - y` and then computing `tensor(h, tensor(h,h))`. We need to enumerate possible integer values of h and compute the corresponding outputs to identify patterns or closed-form solutions.

The Python program will:
1. Define the tensor function
2. Compute the nested tensor operation for small integer values of h
3. Print the results to help identify the pattern

```python
def tensor(x, y):
    return x**3 - y

# Enumerate small integer values of h
for h in range(-5, 6):
    result = tensor(h, tensor(h, h))
    print(f"h = {h}: {result}")

# The pattern suggests the answer might be h^3 - (h^3 - h) = h
# Let's verify this algebraically:
# tensor(h, tensor(h,h)) = h^3 - tensor(h,h) = h^3 - (h^3 - h) = h
# So the function appears to simplify to just h
```
