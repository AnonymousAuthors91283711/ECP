Ground Truth Answer: 4018021
Proposed Answer: 2004 ^ 2 + 2004 + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives a functional equation for a sequence a(n) and asks for the value of a(2004).

2. The ground truth answer is 4,018,021.

3. The proposed answer is 2004² + 2004 + 1.

Let's compute the proposed answer:
2004² = 4,016,016
2004² + 2004 + 1 = 4,016,016 + 2,004 + 1 = 4,018,021

This exactly matches the ground truth answer. The proposed answer is just an expanded form of the same value.
