[write_program]
The problem is to find the real number `x` such that `log₄(16) = log₂(x)`. We'll write a Python program to verify this equality for various values of `x` and find the correct solution.

The key observation is that we can simplify both sides:
1. `log₄(16) = 2` because 4² = 16
2. So we need `2 = log₂(x)`, which means `x = 2² = 4`

The program will verify this by checking the equation for different values of `x` near 4.

```python
import math

def log_base(b, x):
    return math.log(x) / math.log(b)

# We know the answer should be 4, but let's verify it numerically
def verify(x):
    left = log_base(4, 16)
    right = log_base(2, x)
    return abs(left - right) < 1e-10

# Check values around 4
for x in [3.9, 3.99, 4.0, 4.01, 4.1]:
    if verify(x):
        print(f"Found valid solution: x = {x}")
    else:
        print(f"x = {x} doesn't satisfy the equation")

# The exact solution is x = 4
print("The exact solution is x = 4")
```
