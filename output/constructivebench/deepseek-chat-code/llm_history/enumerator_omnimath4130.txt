[write_program]
The problem asks to find all triples of positive integers (a, b, c) such that:
1. a*b - c is a power of 2
2. b*c - a is a power of 2
3. c*a - b is a power of 2

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such triples up to a reasonable limit. The approach will be:
1. Iterate through possible values of a, b, c up to a threshold (100 in this case)
2. For each triple, check if all three conditions are satisfied
3. Print valid triples as they are found

```python
def is_power_of_two(n):
    return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0

max_limit = 100
print(f"Searching for triples (a, b, c) where 1 < a, b, c < {max_limit}")

found = False
for a in range(1, max_limit + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_limit + 1):
        for c in range(1, max_limit + 1):
            ab_c = a * b - c
            bc_a = b * c - a
            ca_b = c * a - b
            if (ab_c > 0 and bc_a > 0 and ca_b > 0 and
                is_power_of_two(ab_c) and
                is_power_of_two(bc_a) and
                is_power_of_two(ca_b)):
                print(f"Found triple: ({a}, {b}, {c})")
                found = True

if not found:
    print("No triples found in the search range")
```
