This problem involves solving a system of equations modulo 12 (since we're working with Fin 12). We'll enumerate all possible values for the variables while satisfying the given constraints. The goal is to find the value of M that satisfies all conditions.

```python
def solve_p2015amcb_4():
    # We'll iterate through all possible values of N (0-11) since it's the most constrained starting point
    for N in range(12):
        # Compute M from h₁: N + 6 ≡ M mod 12
        M = (N + 6) % 12
        
        # Compute Rh from h₅: Rh ≡ N + 1 mod 12
        Rh = (N + 1) % 12
        
        # Compute R from h₄: R ≡ Rh + 2 mod 12
        R = (Rh + 2) % 12
        
        # Compute A from h₂: A ≡ R + 1 mod 12
        A = (R + 1) % 12
        
        # Check h₆: A must be 5
        if A != 5:
            continue
            
        # Compute L from h₃: L ≡ M + 2 mod 12
        L = (M + 2) % 12
        
        # If we reach here, all conditions are satisfied
        print(f"N={N}, M={M}, Rh={Rh}, R={R}, A={A}, L={L}")
        
        # Since we found a valid solution, we can print M and break
        print(f"Found solution: M = {M}")
        return
    
    print("No solution found")
