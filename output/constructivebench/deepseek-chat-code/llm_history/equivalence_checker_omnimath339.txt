Ground Truth Answer: {L : ℕ | L = 1 ∨ Even L}
Proposed Answer: {n | ∃ k : ℕ, n = 2 * k} ∪ {1}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. 

- The ground truth answer is {L | L = 1 ∨ Even L}, which means all positive natural numbers that are either 1 or even.
- The proposed answer is {n | ∃ k : ℕ, n = 2 * k} ∪ {1}, which is exactly the set of all even numbers (since they can be written as 2*k) plus the number 1.

Both formulations describe the same set of numbers: {1, 2, 4, 6, 8, ...}. The only difference is in notation (using "Even L" vs "∃ k : ℕ, n = 2 * k"), but they are mathematically equivalent.
