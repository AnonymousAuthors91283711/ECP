abbrev omnimath220_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath220 :
  {n : ℕ | n ≥ 1 ∧ ∃ m : ℤ, m^2 = n^2 + 3^n} = omnimath220_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for n where n² + 3ⁿ is perfect square (n ≤ 100)...
Found solution: n = 1 (m² = 4)
Found solution: n = 3 (m² = 36). Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
