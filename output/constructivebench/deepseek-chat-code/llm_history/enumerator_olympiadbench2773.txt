This problem involves calculating the difference between two roots of a quadratic equation derived from the sum of digits of 2069. We'll write a Python program to compute all the intermediate values and the final answer.

The steps are:
1. Calculate K = sum of digits of 2069
2. Compute discriminant D = 18Â² - 4*K
3. Find roots r and s using quadratic formula
4. Compute absolute difference between r and s

```python
def sum_digits(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

T = 2069
K = sum_digits(T)
D = 18**2 - 4 * K
sqrt_D = int(D ** 0.5)  # Since D is perfect square in this case
r = (18 + sqrt_D) // 2
s = (18 - sqrt_D) // 2
answer = abs(r - s)

print(f"T = {T}")
print(f"Sum of digits K = {K}")
print(f"Discriminant D = {D}")
print(f"Square root of D = {sqrt_D}")
print(f"Roots: r = {r}, s = {s}")
print(f"Final answer = {answer}")
```
