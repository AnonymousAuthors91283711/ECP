[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of partitions of 64 where each part is a power of 2. The Lean theorem shows the answer is the cardinality of a specific multiset containing all valid partitions. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such partitions systematically.

The approach will:
1. Generate all combinations of powers of 2 that sum to 64
2. Count distinct partitions (order doesn't matter)
3. Avoid duplicate partitions by enforcing non-decreasing order

```python
def count_power_of_two_partitions():
    target = 64
    powers = [2**i for i in range(7)]  # 1,2,4,8,16,32,64
    partitions = set()
    
    def backtrack(remaining, start, path):
        if remaining == 0:
            partitions.add(tuple(sorted(path)))
            return
        for i in range(start, len(powers)):
            power = powers[i]
            if power > remaining:
                continue
            backtrack(remaining - power, i, path + [power])
    
    backtrack(target, 0, [])
    
    # Print all partitions found
    for p in sorted(partitions):
        print(p)
    
    # Print the count (final answer)
    print(f"Total partitions: {len(partitions)}")

count_power_of_two_partitions()
```
