[write_program]
This problem involves calculating a conditional probability based on drawing balls from two urns. The Python program will compute the exact probability as a fraction by enumerating all possible cases and calculating the numerator and denominator according to the given formulas.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve():
    # Define the constants from the problem
    urnA_white = 4
    urnA_red = 2
    urnB_red = 3
    urnB_black = 3
    
    totalA = urnA_white + urnA_red
    totalB = urnB_red + urnB_black
    
    # Calculate numerator
    term1 = Fraction(1, 2) * Fraction(urnA_red, totalA) * Fraction(1, 2) * Fraction(urnB_black, totalB)
    term2 = Fraction(1, 2) * Fraction(urnB_red, totalB) * Fraction(1, 2) * Fraction(urnB_black, totalB - 1)
    numerator = term1 + term2
    
    # Calculate denominator
    term3 = Fraction(1, 2) * Fraction(urnA_red, totalA) * Fraction(1, 2) * Fraction(urnB_black, totalB)
    term4 = Fraction(1, 2) * Fraction(urnA_white, totalA) * Fraction(1, 2) * Fraction(urnB_black, totalB)
    term5 = Fraction(1, 2) * Fraction(urnB_red, totalB) * Fraction(1, 2) * Fraction(urnB_black, totalB - 1)
    term6 = Fraction(1, 2) * Fraction(urnB_black, totalB) * Fraction(1, 2) * Fraction(urnB_black - 1, totalB - 1)
    denominator = term3 + term4 + term5 + term6
    
    # Compute and print the probability
    probability = numerator / denominator
    print(probability)
