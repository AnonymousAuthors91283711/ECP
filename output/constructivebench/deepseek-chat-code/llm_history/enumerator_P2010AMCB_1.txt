[write_program]
This appears to be a problem about two meetings where the first meeting lasts 45 minutes (represented as 45/60 hours) and the second meeting lasts twice as long as the first. The problem asks for the value of (first_meeting + second_meeting)/9.

We'll write a Python program to compute this value exactly as a fraction, then convert it to decimal for verification. The exact fraction form is preferred since it's more precise.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_answer():
    # First meeting is 45 minutes, represented as 45/60 hours
    first_meeting = Fraction(45, 60)
    # Second meeting is twice as long
    second_meeting = 2 * first_meeting
    # Compute the required expression
    result = (first_meeting + second_meeting) / 9
    # Print exact fraction and decimal approximation
    print(f"Exact fraction: {result}")
    print(f"Decimal approximation: {float(result)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_answer()
```
