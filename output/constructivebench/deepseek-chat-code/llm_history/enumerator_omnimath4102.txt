This problem involves finding all pairs of real-valued functions (f, g) that satisfy the given functional equation. We'll approach it by testing polynomial functions of low degrees, as these are often solutions to such equations.

The strategy is:
1. Assume f and g are polynomial functions
2. Try linear and quadratic forms first
3. Substitute into the equation and solve for coefficients
4. Enumerate possible solutions

```python
import sympy as sp

def find_functional_solutions():
    x, y, a, b, c, d, e, f_coeff = sp.symbols('x y a b c d e f_coeff')
    
    # Try linear forms first: f(x) = a*x + b, g(x) = c*x + d
    print("Testing linear forms:")
    f_linear = a*x + b
    g_linear = c*x + d
    
    lhs = g_linear.subs(x, f_linear.subs(x, x + y))
    rhs = f_linear.subs(x, x) + (2*x + y) * g_linear.subs(x, y)
    
    eq = sp.simplify(lhs - rhs)
    coeffs = sp.Poly(eq, x, y).coeffs()
    sol_linear = sp.solve(coeffs, (a, b, c, d))
    
    for sol in sol_linear:
        print(f"Solution found: f(x) = {sol[a]}*x + {sol[b]}, g(x) = {sol[c]}*x + {sol[d]}")
    
    # Try quadratic forms if linear doesn't capture all solutions
    print("\nTesting quadratic forms:")
    f_quad = a*x**2 + b*x + c
    g_quad = d*x**2 + e*x + f_coeff
    
    lhs = g_quad.subs(x, f_quad.subs(x, x + y))
    rhs = f_quad.subs(x, x) + (2*x + y) * g_quad.subs(x, y)
    
    eq = sp.simplify(lhs - rhs)
    coeffs = sp.Poly(eq, x, y).coeffs()
    sol_quad = sp.solve(coeffs, (a, b, c, d, e, f_coeff))
    
    for sol in sol_quad:
        if all(v != 0 for v in sol.values()):  # Filter trivial solutions
            print(f"Solution found: f(x) = {sol[a]}*x^2 + {sol[b]}*x + {sol[c]}, g(x) = {sol[d]}*x^2 + {sol[e]}*x + {sol[f_coeff]}")
