The problem involves finding real coefficients (a, b) for a quadratic polynomial P(x) = x² + a x + b such that for the roots r, s, t of Q(x) = x³ - 21x + 35, the following cyclic relations hold: P(r) = s, P(s) = t, P(t) = r. 

We'll approach this by:
1. Finding the roots of Q(x) numerically (since exact form is complex)
2. Enumerating possible (a, b) pairs that satisfy the cyclic condition
3. Checking for consistency across all roots

```python
import numpy as np
from itertools import product

# Find roots of Q(x) = x^3 - 21x + 35
coeffs = [1, 0, -21, 35]
roots = np.roots(coeffs)

# We'll search a and b in a reasonable range with small steps
step = 0.1
a_range = np.arange(-10, 10 + step, step)
b_range = np.arange(-50, 50 + step, step)

found_pairs = []

for a, b in product(a_range, b_range):
    # Check cyclic condition P(r)=s, P(s)=t, P(t)=r
    P = lambda x: x**2 + a*x + b
    r, s, t = roots
    # Check all permutations of roots to handle different orderings
    conditions = [
        (abs(P(r)-s) < 1e-6 and abs(P(s)-t) < 1e-6 and abs(P(t)-r) < 1e-6),
        (abs(P(r)-t) < 1e-6 and abs(P(t)-s) < 1e-6 and abs(P(s)-r) < 1e-6)
    ]
    if any(conditions):
        found_pairs.append((round(a, 2), round(b, 2)))
        print(f"Found candidate pair: a={round(a, 2)}, b={round(b, 2)}")

# After enumeration, print all unique found pairs
print("\nAll found candidate pairs:")
for pair in set(found_pairs):
    print(pair)
```
