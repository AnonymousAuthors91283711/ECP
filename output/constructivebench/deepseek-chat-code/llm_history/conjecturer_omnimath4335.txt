Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: Prop
From the enumerated answers, we can observe that all positive integers n seem to satisfy the condition except when n is a multiple of 10 (but 10 itself is listed as satisfying). However, since the enumeration cuts off, we can generalize that the condition holds for all positive integers n (since no counterexamples were found in the first 69 numbers except possibly multiples of 10, but 10 itself works).
