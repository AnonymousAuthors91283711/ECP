This problem asks for the minimal value of n = (sum of subset1)^2 + (sum of subset2)^2 where we partition the set [-7, -5, -3, -2, 2, 4, 6, 13] into two equal-sized subsets (4 elements each). We need to enumerate all possible 4-element subsets and compute the minimal n.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def solve():
    elements = [-7, -5, -3, -2, 2, 4, 6, 13]
    min_n = float('inf')
    
    # Generate all combinations of 4 elements
    for s1 in combinations(elements, 4):
        s2 = [x for x in elements if x not in s1]
        sum1 = sum(s1)
        sum2 = sum(s2)
        n = sum1**2 + sum2**2
        
        # Track minimum n found
        if n < min_n:
            min_n = n
            print(f"New minimum found: {n} with partitions {s1} and {s2}")
    
    print(f"\nFinal minimal value: {min_n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```
