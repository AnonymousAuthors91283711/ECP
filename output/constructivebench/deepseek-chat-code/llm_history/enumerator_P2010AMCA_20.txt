[write_program]
This problem involves finding the largest index n such that the product of two strictly increasing integer sequences a(n) and b(n) equals 2010. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible pairs (a(n), b(n)) that multiply to 2010 and satisfy the given conditions.

The approach:
1. Factorize 2010 to get all possible factor pairs (a, b)
2. Filter pairs where a < b (since sequences are strictly increasing and a(2) ≤ b(2))
3. For each valid pair, find the maximum possible n where a(n)*b(n) = 2010
4. Track the maximum n found

```python
import math

def factor_pairs(n):
    """Generate all factor pairs (a,b) of n where a <= b"""
    factors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            factors.add((i, n // i))
    return sorted(factors)

def find_max_n():
    target = 2010
    pairs = factor_pairs(target)
    max_n = 0
    
    for a, b in pairs:
        if a >= b:  # Skip since sequences are strictly increasing and a(2) ≤ b(2)
            continue
            
        # Find possible n where sequences could reach (a,b)
        # Since sequences are strictly increasing from (1,1), n must be at least 2
        # The minimal possible n is when sequences grow as fast as possible:
        # a sequence: 1, 2, 3, ..., a
        # b sequence: 1, a+1, a+2, ..., b (since a(2) ≤ b(2))
        # So n = max(a, b - a + 1)
        n_candidate = max(a, b - a + 1)
        
        # Check if this is a valid scenario where sequences could reach (a,b) at n_candidate
        # We can't verify all intermediate steps, but we can check if it's possible
        if n_candidate > max_n:
            max_n = n_candidate
            print(f"Found new max n={max_n} with pair ({a}, {b})")
    
    print(f"Final maximum n: {max_n}")

find_max_n()
```
