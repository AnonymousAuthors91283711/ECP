Ground Truth Answer: 420
Proposed Answer: 840
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the largest natural number n where every positive integer m less than the cube root of n divides n.

2. The ground truth answer is 420. Let's verify why:
   - Cube root of 420 is ~7.48
   - Numbers to check: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
   - All these numbers divide 420 (420 is divisible by each)

3. The proposed answer is 840:
   - Cube root of 840 is ~9.44
   - Numbers to check: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
   - 840 is not divisible by 7 (840/7=120), but 8 doesn't divide 840 (840/8=105)
   - So 840 fails the condition

4. 420 is indeed the largest number satisfying this condition, as numbers larger than 420 will either:
   - Have larger cube roots requiring more divisors
   - Or fail to be divisible by all numbers below their cube root

The proposed answer (840) does not satisfy the condition, while the ground truth (420) does. They are not equivalent.
