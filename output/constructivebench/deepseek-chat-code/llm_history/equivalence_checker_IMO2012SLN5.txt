Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ (a m : ℕ), ∀ (n : ℕ), f n = a * n ^ m}
Proposed Answer: {f : ℕ → ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, ∀ n : ℕ, f n = n^k}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is a subset of the ground truth answer where a=1. The ground truth answer allows for any constant multiplier a, while the proposed answer only considers the case where a=1. The proposed answer is correct in form but misses some valid solutions, so it's "Close" but not fully equivalent.
