[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimal sum a+b+c where a,b,c are distinct positive integers satisfying a^b * b^c = a^c. We'll write a program to search for such triples (a,b,c) and find the minimal sum.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible sums s starting from the smallest possible (6 = 1+2+3)
2. For each sum, generate all distinct triples (a,b,c) with a+b+c = s
3. Check if they satisfy the equation a^b * b^c = a^c
4. Stop when we find the first valid triple (which will have minimal sum)

```python
def find_minimal_triple():
    s = 6  # minimal possible sum for distinct positive integers
    while True:
        # Generate all distinct triples (a,b,c) with a+b+c = s
        for a in range(1, s-1):
            for b in range(1, s-a):
                c = s - a - b
                if a > 0 and b > 0 and c > 0 and a != b and a != c and b != c:
                    # Check the equation a^b * b^c == a^c
                    left = (a ** b) * (b ** c)
                    right = a ** c
                    if left == right:
                        print(f"Found triple: ({a}, {b}, {c}) with sum {s}")
                        return
        s += 1

find_minimal_triple()
```
