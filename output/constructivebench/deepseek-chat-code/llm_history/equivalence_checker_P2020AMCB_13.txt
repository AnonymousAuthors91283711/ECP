Ground Truth Answer: sqrt (log 6 / log 2 + log 6 / log 3)
Proposed Answer: sqrt (log 9 / log 2) + sqrt (log 4 / log 3)
Let's analyze the two expressions:

Ground Truth: sqrt(log6/log2 + log6/log3)
Proposed: sqrt(log9/log2) + sqrt(log4/log3)

First, let's simplify the ground truth:
log6/log2 + log6/log3 = log6 * (1/log2 + 1/log3) = log6 * (log3 + log2)/(log2*log3) = log6 * log6/(log2*log3) = (log6)^2/(log2*log3)

Now let's look at the proposed answer:
sqrt(log9/log2) = sqrt(2log3/log2)
sqrt(log4/log3) = sqrt(2log2/log3)

So the proposed answer becomes:
sqrt(2)*sqrt(log3/log2) + sqrt(2)*sqrt(log2/log3) = sqrt(2)*(sqrt(log3/log2) + sqrt(log2/log3))

The ground truth is sqrt((log6)^2/(log2*log3)) = log6/sqrt(log2*log3)

These are clearly different expressions. The proposed answer has an additive structure while the ground truth is a single square root. They are not equivalent.
