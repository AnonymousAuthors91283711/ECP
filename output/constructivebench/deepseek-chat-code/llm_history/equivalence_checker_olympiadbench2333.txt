theorem olympiadbench2333 (p : ℝ) (hp : 0 ≤ p ∧ p ≤ 1) :
    ∃ (a b c d : ℤ), d ≠ 0 ∧ olympiadbench2333_answer p = (a * p^2 + b * p + c) / d := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun p => (1 - p^2) / 3
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℝ => (2 * p^2 + 3 * p + 1) / 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function of p (with 0 ≤ p ≤ 1) that can be expressed as (a*p² + b*p + c)/d where a,b,c,d are integers and d≠0.

2. The ground truth answer is (1 - p²)/3, which can be rewritten as (-1*p² + 0*p + 1)/3, satisfying the conditions with a=-1, b=0, c=1, d=3.

3. The proposed answer is (2*p² + 3*p + 1)/4, which satisfies the conditions with a=2, b=3, c=1, d=4.

4. These are clearly different functions:
- At p=0: ground truth gives 1/3 ≈ 0.333, proposed gives 1/4 = 0.25
- At p=1: ground truth gives 0, proposed gives (2+3+1)/4 = 1.5

The functions are not equivalent.
