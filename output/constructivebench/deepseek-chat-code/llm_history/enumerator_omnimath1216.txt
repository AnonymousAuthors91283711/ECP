[write_program]
This problem asks for the count of natural numbers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) where the least common multiple of n and 9 is a perfect square. We'll write a Python program to enumerate these numbers and count them.

Key observations:
1. lcm(n,9) = n*9/gcd(n,9)
2. For lcm(n,9) to be a perfect square, the prime factorization must have even exponents
3. We need to consider how n interacts with 9 (which is 3²)

```python
import math
from math import gcd

def is_square(x):
    s = int(math.isqrt(x))
    return s * s == x

count = 0
for n in range(1, 1001):
    lcm = n * 9 // gcd(n, 9)
    if is_square(lcm):
        count += 1
        print(n)  # Stream found numbers

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
