[write_program]
The problem asks to find natural numbers n between 10 and 20 where there exists a natural number k such that 4^k + 5^k = n² and n² is divisible by 9. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of n and k that satisfy these conditions.

```python
def main():
    # Check n in range 11 to 19 (since 10 < n < 20)
    for n in range(11, 20):
        n_squared = n * n
        # Check if n² is divisible by 9
        if n_squared % 9 == 0:
            max_k = 10  # Reasonable upper bound for k
            found = False
            # Check possible k values
            for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
                if (4**k + 5**k) == n_squared:
                    print(f"Found solution: n={n}, k={k}")
                    found = True
                    break
            if not found:
                print(f"n={n} satisfies n² divisible by 9 but no matching k found")
        else:
            print(f"n={n} doesn't satisfy n² divisible by 9")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
