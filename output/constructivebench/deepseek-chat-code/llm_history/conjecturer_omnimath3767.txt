abbrev omnimath3767_answer : Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath3767 : 
  (∃ (p q r : ℚ), p + q + r = 0 ∧ p * q * r = 1) ↔ omnimath3767_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No solutions found with denominator up to 5. Expected Answer Type: Prop
<<<False>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks if there exist rational numbers p, q, r that sum to 0 and multiply to 1. The enumeration found no solutions with small denominators, suggesting no solutions exist. This aligns with the fact that the only real solution (1, ω, ω² where ω is a primitive cube root of unity) is irrational.
