. Enumerated Answers: Simplified fraction: 729/1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
Based on the problem statement and the enumerated answer, we need to provide a pair of coprime natural numbers representing the simplified fraction 729/1. The error in the original code appears to be a syntax issue with multiple let declarations on the same line without proper separators.

The answer should be a pair where the first element is 729 and the second is 1, which are coprime. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<(729, 1)>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem involves counting configurations with certain independence properties
2. The enumerated answer shows the simplified fraction is 729/1
3. The pair (729, 1) satisfies both requirements:
   - It represents the fraction 729/1
   - 729 and 1 are coprime (gcd(729,1) = 1)
4. The error in the original code was unrelated to the answer itself, but rather a syntax issue in the theorem statement[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
