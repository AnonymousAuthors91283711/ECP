No prime factors found (shouldn't happen for n > 1). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the problem statement and the enumerated answer showing no prime factors found for n=7999999999, this suggests the number is either 1 (which has no prime factors) or a prime itself. Since 7999999999 is greater than 1 and has no prime factors, it must be prime. The greatest prime factor of a prime number is the number itself.
