[write_program]
This problem asks for all positive integer solutions (x,y) to the equation x³ + y³ = x² + 42xy + y². We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible solutions efficiently by bounding the search space.

The approach:
1. Observe that for x,y > 0, x³ + y³ grows faster than the right side
2. Find a reasonable upper bound where x³ exceeds the right side
3. Enumerate all (x,y) pairs below this bound
4. Check the equation condition for each pair

```python
def find_solutions():
    max_n = 100  # Empirical upper bound where x^3 dominates
    solutions = []
    
    for x in range(1, max_n + 1):
        for y in range(1, max_n + 1):
            lhs = x**3 + y**3
            rhs = x**2 + 42*x*y + y**2
            if lhs == rhs:
                solutions.append((x, y))
                print(f"Found solution: ({x}, {y})")
    
    if solutions:
        print("\nAll solutions found:")
        for sol in sorted(solutions):
            print(sol)
    else:
        print("No solutions found in the search space")

find_solutions()
```
