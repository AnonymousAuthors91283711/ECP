Ground Truth Answer: fun n => if Even n then n / (n + 2) else 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n % 2 = 1 then 1 else (n / 2 : ℝ) / (n / 2 + 1)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. For odd n (n % 2 = 1):
- Ground truth: returns 1 (since Even n is false)
- Proposed: returns 1 (explicit check for n % 2 = 1)
- These match

2. For even n (n % 2 = 0):
- Ground truth: returns n/(n+2)
- Proposed: returns (n/2)/(n/2 + 1)
- Let's test with n=2:
  - Ground truth: 2/(2+2) = 2/4 = 0.5
  - Proposed: (2/2)/(2/2 + 1) = 1/2 = 0.5
- Let's test with n=4:
  - Ground truth: 4/6 ≈ 0.666...
  - Proposed: 2/3 ≈ 0.666...
- These are mathematically equivalent since n/(n+2) = (n/2)/(n/2 + 1)

The two answers are mathematically equivalent, just expressed in different forms. The proposed answer uses division by 2 explicitly while the ground truth keeps it in terms of n, but they produce the same results.
