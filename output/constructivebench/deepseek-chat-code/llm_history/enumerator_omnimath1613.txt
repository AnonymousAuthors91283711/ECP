[write_program]
This problem asks for the largest natural number `n` such that every positive integer `m` less than the cube root of `n` divides `n`. We'll write a Python program to enumerate candidates and find the maximum such `n`.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible values of `n` in descending order (since we want the largest).
2. For each `n`, check all `m` from 1 to floor(n^(1/3))-1.
3. If all such `m` divide `n`, we've found our candidate.
4. Stop when we find the first (largest) such `n`.

```python
import math

def find_max_n():
    # Start checking from a reasonable upper bound (1000 is sufficient for this problem)
    for n in range(1000, 0, -1):
        max_m = int(math.pow(n, 1/3))  # Cube root of n
        all_divide = True
        for m in range(1, max_m):
            if n % m != 0:
                all_divide = False
                break
        if all_divide and max_m > 1:  # Ensure at least one m exists (max_m > 1)
            print(f"Found candidate: {n}")
            return n
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = find_max_n()
    print(f"Maximum n satisfying the condition: {result}")
```
