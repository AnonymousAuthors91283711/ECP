This problem asks for the smallest year y > 2012 such that the number of days between January 1, 2012 and January 1, y is divisible by 7. The number of days is calculated as (y-2012)*365 plus the number of leap years in between.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Check each year after 2012
2. Calculate the total days including leap years
3. Find the first year where days % 7 == 0

```python
def is_leap_year(y):
    """Check if year y is a leap year"""
    return y % 4 == 0 and (y % 100 != 0 or y % 400 == 0)

def count_leap_years(start, end):
    """Count leap years between start (inclusive) and end (exclusive)"""
    return sum(1 for y in range(start, end) if is_leap_year(y))

def find_first_matching_year():
    start_year = 2012
    for y in range(start_year + 1, start_year + 100):  # Check up to 100 years ahead
        years_passed = y - start_year
        leap_days = count_leap_years(start_year, y)
        total_days = years_passed * 365 + leap_days
        if total_days % 7 == 0:
            print(f"Found matching year: {y}")
            print(f"Total days: {total_days} (mod 7 = {total_days % 7})")
            print(f"Leap years counted: {leap_days}")
            return y
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = find_first_matching_year()
    if result:
        print(f"The smallest year after 2012 with matching condition is: {result}")
    else:
        print("No matching year found in the search range")
```
