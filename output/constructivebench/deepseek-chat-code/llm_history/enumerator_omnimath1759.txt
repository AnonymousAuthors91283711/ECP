[write_program]
This problem involves summing a conditional expression over integers from 1 to 199. The expression is:
- 0 if n is divisible by 10
- +n if n is odd and not divisible by 10
- -n if n is even and not divisible by 10

We'll write a Python program to compute this sum exactly. The program will iterate through numbers 1 to 199, apply the conditions, and accumulate the sum.

```python
def compute_sum():
    total = 0
    for n in range(1, 200):  # 1 to 199 inclusive
        if n % 10 == 0:
            continue  # adds 0
        if n % 2 == 1:  # odd
            total += n
        else:  # even
            total -= n
    return total

result = compute_sum()
print(f"The sum is: {result}")
```
