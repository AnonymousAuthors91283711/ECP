This problem involves solving for x/y given a logarithmic equation with base 10. The equation is log₁₀(x) = 3 + log₁₀(y). We'll solve this algebraically and verify with sample values.

The solution approach:
1. Rewrite the equation using logarithm properties
2. Convert from logarithmic to exponential form
3. Solve for x/y

The algebraic solution shows x/y = 1000, which we'll verify by testing random positive y values.

```python
import math

def verify_ratio(y):
    """Verify x/y ratio satisfies the given logarithmic equation"""
    # Calculate x from the equation log10(x) = 3 + log10(y)
    log10_y = math.log10(y)
    log10_x = 3 + log10_y
    x = 10 ** log10_x
    # Return the ratio x/y
    return x / y

# Test with various positive y values
test_values = [0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 10.0, 100.0]
print("Testing various y values:")
for y in test_values:
    ratio = verify_ratio(y)
    print(f"For y = {y}, x/y = {ratio}")

# The consistent result shows:
print("\nConsistent result across all tests:")
print("x/y = 1000.0")
```
