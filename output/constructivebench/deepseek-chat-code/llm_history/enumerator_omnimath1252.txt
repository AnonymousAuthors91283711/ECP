[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n that can be expressed as the sum of three cubes in two distinct ways (considering permutations as the same). We'll write a Python program to search for such numbers by checking sums of three cubes up to a reasonable limit.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible sums of three cubes
2. For each sum, store all distinct triplets (sorted to avoid permutations)
3. When we find a sum with multiple distinct triplets, print it
4. After checking up to a limit, output the smallest such number found

```python
def find_min_multiple_cube_sums():
    from collections import defaultdict
    max_cube = 20  # We'll check cubes up to 20^3 = 8000
    cube_sums = defaultdict(list)
    
    # Generate all possible sums of three cubes a³ + b³ + c³ where a ≤ b ≤ c
    for a in range(1, max_cube + 1):
        a_cubed = a ** 3
        for b in range(a, max_cube + 1):
            b_cubed = b ** 3
            for c in range(b, max_cube + 1):
                n = a_cubed + b_cubed + c ** 3
                triplet = (a, b, c)
                cube_sums[n].append(triplet)
    
    # Find numbers with multiple distinct representations
    candidates = []
    for n in sorted(cube_sums.keys()):
        triplets = cube_sums[n]
        # Check if there are at least two distinct triplets
        if len(triplets) >= 2:
            # Compare all pairs to find distinct ones
            for i in range(len(triplets)):
                for j in range(i+1, len(triplets)):
                    if triplets[i] != triplets[j]:
                        print(f"Found {n} = {triplets[i]} and {triplets[j]}")
                        candidates.append(n)
                        break
                if n in candidates:
                    break
    
    if candidates:
        print(f"Smallest number with multiple representations: {min(candidates)}")
    else:
        print("No numbers found with multiple representations in this range")

find_min_multiple_cube_sums()
