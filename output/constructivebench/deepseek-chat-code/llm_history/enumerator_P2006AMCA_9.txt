This problem involves finding two natural numbers (pencilCost and eraserCost) where:
1. pencilCost > eraserCost
2. 13*pencilCost + 3*eraserCost = 100
3. We need to find pencilCost + eraserCost

We'll enumerate possible values of pencilCost (since it must be positive and less than 100/13 â‰ˆ 7.69) and check the conditions.

```python
def solve():
    # We know 13*p + 3*e = 100 and p > e
    # Maximum possible p is floor(100/13) = 7
    for p in range(1, 8):
        remaining = 100 - 13 * p
        if remaining % 3 != 0:
            continue
        e = remaining // 3
        if e > 0 and p > e:
            print(f"pencilCost={p}, eraserCost={e}, sum={p + e}")

    # After enumerating all possibilities, we can see the valid solution
    print("\nThe answer is the sum from the valid case above")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```
