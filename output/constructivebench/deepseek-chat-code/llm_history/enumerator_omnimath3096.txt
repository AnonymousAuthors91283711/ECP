The problem gives three equations with three variables (a, b, c) and asks to find a specific combination. We'll solve the system of equations to find the values of a, b, and c, then compute the required answer.

```python
def solve():
    # Given equations:
    # 1) a + b = 998
    # 2) a + c = 1050
    # 3) b + c = 1234
    
    # Solving the system:
    # From eq1: a = 998 - b
    # Substitute into eq2: (998 - b) + c = 1050 => c = 1050 - 998 + b = 52 + b
    # Substitute c into eq3: b + (52 + b) = 1234 => 2b = 1182 => b = 591
    # Then a = 998 - 591 = 407
    # And c = 52 + 591 = 643
    
    a = 407
    b = 591
    c = 643
    
    # The answer is computed from these values
    answer = a + b + c  # Or whatever operation is needed
    print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}, c = {c}")
    print(f"Answer: {answer}")
