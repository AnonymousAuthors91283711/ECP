This problem involves summing the count of unique digits for each number in the range [10^2018, 10^2019-1]. Since directly computing this for large exponents is impractical, we'll analyze smaller exponents to identify a pattern.

We'll write a Python program that:
1. Computes the sum for smaller exponents (1, 2, 3)
2. Calculates the count of numbers with each possible number of unique digits
3. Uses this to derive the general formula

```python
def count_unique_digits(n):
    return len(set(str(n)))

def compute_sum_for_exponent(e):
    start = 10 ** (e - 1)
    end = 10 ** e
    total = 0
    for n in range(start, end):
        total += count_unique_digits(n)
    return total

# Compute for exponents 1 through 4 to identify pattern
for e in range(1, 5):
    res = compute_sum_for_exponent(e)
    print(f"Exponent {e}: sum = {res}")

# Analyze the pattern and derive general formula
# For exponent e, the sum appears to be 9 * (10^(e-1) * e - (10^e - 1)/9)
# Let's verify this for our computed values
for e in range(1, 5):
    calculated = 9 * (10**(e-1) * e - (10**e - 1)//9)
    print(f"Exponent {e}: calculated = {calculated}")
```
