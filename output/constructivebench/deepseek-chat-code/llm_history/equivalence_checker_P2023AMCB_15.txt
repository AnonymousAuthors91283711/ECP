Ground Truth Answer: True
Proposed Answer: ∀ a b c : ℕ, 0 < a → 0 < b → 0 < c → 15 * a + 14 * b = c → (Nat.gcd c 210 = 1 ↔ Nat.gcd a 14 = 1 ∧ Nat.gcd b 15 = 1)
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer captures the main equivalence (Nat.gcd c 210 = 1 ↔ Nat.gcd a 14 = 1 ∧ Nat.gcd b 15 = 1) which is the most substantial part of the ground truth answer. However, it omits the two implications about ¬(Nat.gcd a 14 = 1 ∨ Nat.gcd b 15 = 1) → ¬Nat.gcd c 210 = 1 and Nat.gcd c 210 = 1 → (Nat.gcd a 14 = 1 ∨ Nat.gcd b 15 = 1). These are logically related to the main equivalence but not explicitly stated in the proposed answer. Therefore, the answer is Close - mostly correct but missing some parts.
