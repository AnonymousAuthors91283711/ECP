abbrev omnimath4066_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath4066 (n k : ℕ) (h : n ≥ k) :
    (n, k) ∈ omnimath4066_answer ↔ k!! * (n - k)!! ∣ n!! := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(n, k) | k = 0 ∨ k = n ∨ (Even n ∧ Even k) ∨ (n, k) = (2, 1)}
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℕ × ℕ => p.2 ≤ p.1 ∧ p.2 % 2 = p.1 % 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding pairs (n, k) where k!! * (n - k)!! divides n!!.

2. The ground truth answer states that this holds when:
   - k = 0 (trivial case)
   - k = n (trivial case)
   - Both n and k are even
   - Special case (2,1)

3. The proposed answer says the condition holds when:
   - k ≤ n (which is given in the theorem as n ≥ k)
   - k and n have the same parity (both even or both odd)

Comparison:
- The proposed answer correctly captures the cases where both n and k are even (same parity)
- It misses the trivial cases (k=0 or k=n) since these don't necessarily require same parity
- It misses the special case (2,1) where n=2 (even) and k=1 (odd) but still satisfies the condition
- It incorrectly includes cases where both n and k are odd (these don't generally satisfy the condition)

The proposed answer is partially correct but has significant omissions and incorrect inclusions.
