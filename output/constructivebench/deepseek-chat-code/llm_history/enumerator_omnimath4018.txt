This problem involves finding the smallest natural number `n` such that `x_sequence n = 1995`, where `x_sequence` is defined recursively with functions `p` and `q` that aren't specified. Since we don't know `p` and `q`, we'll need to make reasonable assumptions to model the problem.

We'll assume `p` and `q` are simple arithmetic functions that could produce 1995 from the sequence. A common pattern is that `p(x) = x + c` and `q(x) = d` for constants `c` and `d`. We'll try small integer values for these constants.

```python
def x_sequence(p, q, max_steps=20):
    seq = [1]
    for _ in range(max_steps):
        x = seq[-1]
        next_x = (x * p(x)) // q(x) if q(x) != 0 else 0
        seq.append(next_x)
        if next_x == 1995:
            return seq
    return seq

# Try different simple p and q functions
def test_functions():
    # Test p(x) = x + k, q(x) = m for small k, m
    for k in range(1, 5):
        for m in range(1, 5):
            p = lambda x, k=k: x + k
            q = lambda x, m=m: m
            seq = x_sequence(p, q)
            if 1995 in seq:
                n = seq.index(1995)
                print(f"Found with p(x)=x+{k}, q(x)={m}: n={n}, sequence={seq[:n+1]}")

test_functions()
```

This program tests simple linear functions for `p` and constant functions for `q`. It stops when it finds 1995 in the sequence and reports the parameters and the smallest `n` that reaches 1995. The output will show which simple function combinations can produce 1995 and at what step.

Judgement:
The original program is rejected because:
1. It fails to find any solution (outputs empty result) for the given problem constraints
2. The search space for p and q functions is too limited (only testing linear p and constant q)
3. The program doesn't follow the streaming requirement - it only outputs after finding a complete sequence
4. The approach doesn't guarantee finding the minimal n where x_sequence(n) = 1995

The corrected program should:
1. Expand the search space for p and q functions
2. Output partial results as they are found
3. Track and report the minimal n found
4. Include more diverse function forms for p and q

Judgement:
The problem appears to be about finding the smallest natural number n such that x_sequence(n) = 1995, where x_sequence is defined recursively. However, the provided "program" is empty and contains no implementation. Since there's no code to evaluate, we must reject this submission.

The problem requires:
1. Defining the recursive sequence x_sequence based on functions p and q
2. Finding the smallest n where x_sequence(n) = 1995
3. Without knowing p and q, we cannot implement the solution

Since the problem statement doesn't provide definitions for p and q, and the program is empty, we must reject this submission. A proper solution would need to either:
1. Make reasonable assumptions about p and q, or
2. Clearly state that the problem cannot be solved without these definitions

<<<False>>>

```python
# Cannot implement solution - missing definitions for p and q functions
# The problem requires knowing how p and q transform the sequence
# Without these, we cannot compute x_sequence or find when it equals 1995
print("Error: Cannot solve - missing definitions for p and q functions")
```
