This problem involves finding the real roots of a 9th degree polynomial equation. To approach this systematically, we'll:

1. Look for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem
2. Check for possible factorizations or substitutions
3. Enumerate possible roots numerically if exact forms aren't found

The substitution y = x^3 simplifies the equation to a cubic in y, which may be more tractable. We'll implement this approach in Python.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, nroots, Rational

def find_roots():
    x = symbols('x')
    # Original equation: x^9 + (9/8)x^6 + (27/64)x^3 - x + 219/512 = 0
    equation = Eq(x**9 + Rational(9,8)*x**6 + Rational(27,64)*x**3 - x + Rational(219,512), 0)
    
    # Try substitution y = x^3
    y = symbols('y')
    substituted_eq = Eq(y**3 + Rational(9,8)*y**2 + Rational(27,64)*y - x + Rational(219,512), 0)
    
    # First look for exact rational roots
    print("Checking for exact rational roots:")
    possible_rationals = [Fraction(n,d) for d in [1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512] 
                         for n in range(-512,513)]
    
    found_exact = False
    for r in possible_rationals:
        val = r**9 + Fraction(9,8)*r**6 + Fraction(27,64)*r**3 - r + Fraction(219,512)
        if val == 0:
            print(f"Exact rational root found: x = {r}")
            found_exact = True
    
    if not found_exact:
        print("No exact rational roots found")
    
    # Now compute numerical approximations
    print("\nNumerical approximations:")
    numerical_roots = nroots(equation.lhs, n=15)
    for root in numerical_roots:
        print(f"x â‰ˆ {root:.15f}")
