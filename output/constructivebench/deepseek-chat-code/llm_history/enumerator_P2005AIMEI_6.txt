[write_program]
This problem involves finding the floor of the real part of the product of non-real roots of a given quartic polynomial. We'll write a Python program to compute the roots numerically, filter the non-real ones, compute their product, and output the floor of its real part.

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.polynomial import Polynomial

# Define the polynomial coefficients: x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x - 2005
coeffs = [1, -4, 6, -4, -2005]
p = Polynomial(coeffs)

# Find all roots (including complex ones)
roots = p.roots()

# Filter non-real roots (those with non-zero imaginary part)
nonreal_roots = [root for root in roots if abs(root.imag) > 1e-10]

# Compute product of non-real roots
product = 1.0
for root in nonreal_roots:
    product *= root

# Print the floor of the real part of the product
print(int(np.floor(product.real)))
```

The program:
1. Defines the polynomial using numpy's Polynomial class
2. Finds all roots (both real and complex)
3. Filters to keep only non-real roots (those with significant imaginary part)
4. Computes the product of these non-real roots
5. Outputs the floor of the real part of this product

The output will be the required integer answer for the problem. The numerical computation should give sufficient precision for this purpose.
