Ground Truth Answer: 2017
Proposed Answer: 6433
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the sum of a list where each element is d * 4^p, with d and p being corresponding elements from two lists:
   - d list: [1,0,2,0,1,2,1]
   - p list: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]

2. Calculating each term:
   1*4^0 = 1
   0*4^1 = 0
   2*4^2 = 32
   0*4^3 = 0
   1*4^4 = 256
   2*4^5 = 2048
   1*4^6 = 4096

3. Summing these: 1 + 0 + 32 + 0 + 256 + 2048 + 4096 = 6433

The ground truth answer claims the sum is 2017, but our calculation shows it's 6433. The proposed answer matches our calculation.
