This problem relates the coefficients of a cubic polynomial to the sum of squares of its roots. Given the polynomial equation (x-a)(x-b)(x-c) = x³ - 20x² + 19x + T, we need to find a² + b² + c² in terms of T.

From Vieta's formulas, we know:
1. a + b + c = 20
2. ab + ac + bc = 19
3. abc = -T

The sum of squares can be expressed as:
a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + ac + bc)

We'll compute this for sample values of T to verify the pattern.

```python
def compute_sum_of_squares(T):
    # Using Vieta's formulas and the sum of squares identity
    sum_roots = 20
    sum_pairwise_products = 19
    sum_of_squares = sum_roots**2 - 2 * sum_pairwise_products
    return sum_of_squares

# Test with sample T values (since abc = -T)
sample_Ts = [-10, 0, 10, 30]
print("Testing with sample T values:")
for T in sample_Ts:
    result = compute_sum_of_squares(T)
    print(f"For T = {T}, a² + b² + c² = {result}")

# The result is constant regardless of T
print("\nFinal observation:")
print("a² + b² + c² is always", compute_sum_of_squares(0))
```
