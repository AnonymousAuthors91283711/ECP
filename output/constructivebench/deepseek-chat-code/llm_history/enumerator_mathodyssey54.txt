This problem involves finding the minimum value of z = 2a² + b² under the constraint a³ + b³ + 6ab = 8 with a,b ≥ 0. We'll enumerate possible (a,b) pairs that satisfy the constraint and compute z for each, tracking the minimum.

The approach:
1. Sample a values from 0 to 2 (since a³ ≤ 8)
2. For each a, solve for b using the constraint equation
3. Keep only real, non-negative b solutions
4. Compute z = 2a² + b² for valid pairs
5. Track the minimum z encountered

```python
import math

def find_min_z():
    min_z = float('inf')
    best_pair = None
    
    # Sample a values with small step size for accuracy
    for a in [x/1000 for x in range(0, 2001)]:
        # Coefficients for cubic equation in b: b³ + (6a)b + (a³ - 8) = 0
        coeffs = [1, 0, 6*a, a**3 - 8]
        
        # Find real roots
        roots = []
        # Using numpy's roots function for simplicity (though we could implement our own)
        try:
            import numpy as np
            all_roots = np.roots(coeffs)
            roots = [r.real for r in all_roots if abs(r.imag) < 1e-9 and r.real >= 0]
        except:
            # Fallback for when numpy isn't available - less accurate but works for small samples
            # This is a simplified approach that might miss some roots
            if a == 0:
                b = 2.0
                roots.append(b)
            else:
                # Try to find approximate solution
                for b in [x/1000 for x in range(0, 2001)]:
                    if abs(b**3 + 6*a*b + a**3 - 8) < 0.01:
                        roots.append(b)
        
        for b in roots:
            if b >= 0:
                z = 2*a**2 + b**2
                if z < min_z:
                    min_z = z
                    best_pair = (a, b)
                    print(f"New minimum z={z:.6f} at (a,b)=({a:.6f},{b:.6f})")
    
    print(f"\nFinal minimum z={min_z:.6f} at (a,b)=({best_pair[0]:.6f},{best_pair[1]:.6f})")

find_min_z()
