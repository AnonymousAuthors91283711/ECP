Looking at the enumerated answers and their evaluations, we can observe that Expression 1 (x + y + z) gives 0.1 + (-0.9) + 1.1 = 0.3 which matches the first sample evaluation. This simple sum satisfies all given conditions:
- For x ∈ (0,1), y ∈ (-1,0), z ∈ (1,2), the sum x+y+z ranges between (0+(-1)+1=0) and (1+0+2=3), always positive.
