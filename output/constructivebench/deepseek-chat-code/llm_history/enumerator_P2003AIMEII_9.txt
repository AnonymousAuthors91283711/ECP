[write_program]
This problem involves finding the sum of a polynomial P evaluated at the roots of another polynomial Q. We'll write a Python program to:
1. Find the roots of Q numerically
2. Evaluate P at each root
3. Sum the evaluations

Since exact symbolic computation is complex, we'll use numerical methods with sufficient precision. We'll use numpy's polynomial tools for root finding and evaluation.

```python
import numpy as np

def solve_problem():
    # Define the polynomials using numpy's convention (coefficients in reverse order)
    P_coeffs = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 0]  # -X^2 - X^3 - X^5 + X^6
    Q_coeffs = [-1, -1, -1, 1, 0]          # -1 - X^2 - X^3 + X^4
    
    # Find roots of Q (numerical approximation)
    roots = np.roots(Q_coeffs)
    
    # Filter real roots (problem implies we need real roots)
    real_roots = [r for r in roots if np.isreal(r)]
    real_roots = np.real(real_roots)  # Convert to real numbers
    
    # Evaluate P at each root and sum
    P = np.polynomial.Polynomial(P_coeffs[::-1])  # numpy uses ascending order
    sum_P = sum(P(r) for r in real_roots)
    
    # Print each evaluation and the sum
    print("Roots of Q:", real_roots)
    for i, r in enumerate(real_roots):
        print(f"P(z_{i}) = {P(r)}")
    print("Sum of P(z_i):", sum_P)
