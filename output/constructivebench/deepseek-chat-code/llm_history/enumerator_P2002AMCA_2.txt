The problem is to find the value of (x-3)/9 given that (x-9)/3 = 43. We can solve this algebraically by first finding x from the given equation, then computing the required expression. The Python program will demonstrate this calculation.

```python
# Given equation: (x - 9) / 3 = 43
# First solve for x:
x = 43 * 3 + 9
# Then compute (x - 3) / 9
result = (x - 3) // 9
print(result)
```
