Ground Truth Answer: fun x => (1/2) * Real.sqrt x
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℝ => Real.sqrt x / 2
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: (1/2) * Real.sqrt x
2. Proposed: Real.sqrt x / 2

These are mathematically equivalent expressions because:
- Division by 2 is the same as multiplication by 1/2
- The order of multiplication/division doesn't matter for real numbers
- Both expressions represent exactly the same function

The proposed answer is just a different way of writing the same mathematical expression. The equivalence holds for all real numbers x where the square root is defined (x ≥ 0), which is consistent with the problem's constraints (x > 0).
