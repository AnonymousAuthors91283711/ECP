theorem omnimath2510 : 
  Fintype.card {f : Fin 10 → Fin 10 | ∀ (i j : Fin 10), i.val + j.val + 2 = 11 → f i + f j = 11} = omnimath2510_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Number of valid functions: 32768. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<2^15>>> 

Explanation: The enumerated answer 32768 is 2^15. The condition i.val + j.val + 2 = 11 implies we're dealing with pairs (i,j) where i+j=9, creating 5 pairs in Fin 10. For each pair, f(i) and f(j) must satisfy f(i)+f(j)=11, giving 2 choices per pair (since f(j) is determined once f(i) is chosen). 2^5 choices for pairs multiplied by 2^10 for unconstrained elements gives 2^15 total functions.
