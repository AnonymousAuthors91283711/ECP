[write_program]
This problem involves finding the value of an expression involving two real numbers r₁ and r₂ that satisfy r₁ + r₂ = 180 and r₁ * r₂ = 8. The expression to evaluate is r₁/(r₂^(1/3)) + r₂/(r₁^(1/3)).

To approach this, we'll:
1. Solve the system of equations to find possible (r₁, r₂) pairs
2. For each valid pair, compute the expression value
3. Since the problem suggests there's a single answer, we'll verify if all valid pairs give the same result

The program will:
1. Find roots of the quadratic equation x² - 180x + 8 = 0
2. For each root pair, compute the expression value
3. Print the results showing they're equal

```python
import math

def main():
    # Coefficients from x^2 - 180x + 8 = 0
    a, b, c = 1, -180, 8
    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
    r1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
    r2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
    
    # Compute the expression for both orderings
    expr1 = r1 / (r2 ** (1/3)) + r2 / (r1 ** (1/3))
    expr2 = r2 / (r1 ** (1/3)) + r1 / (r2 ** (1/3))
    
    # Print results with sufficient precision
    print(f"Using r1 = {r1:.15f}, r2 = {r2:.15f}")
    print(f"Expression value: {expr1:.15f}")
    print(f"Using swapped values: {expr2:.15f}")
    
    # Verify equality (should be identical)
    print(f"Difference: {abs(expr1 - expr2):.15f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
