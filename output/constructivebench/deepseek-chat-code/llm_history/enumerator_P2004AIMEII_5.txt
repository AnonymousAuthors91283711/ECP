This problem involves finding the smallest integer x such that for some integer w, the remaining work after three quarters can be completed by workers with efficiency (800+x) in the last quarter. We'll model this mathematically and enumerate possible x values.

The key steps:
1. Calculate remaining work after three quarters: 1000w - (1000 + 900 + 800)(w/4) = 1000w - 2700(w/4) = (4000w - 2700w)/4 = 1300w/4
2. The condition becomes: (800+x)(w/4) ≥ 1300w/4
3. Simplify to: 800 + x ≥ 1300 ⇒ x ≥ 500

The minimal x is clearly 500, but let's verify this with code:

```python
def find_min_x():
    # We'll check x values from 0 upwards until we find the smallest satisfying x
    for x in range(0, 1000):
        # The condition simplifies to x >= 500, so we can actually stop at 500
        if x >= 500:
            print(f"Found minimal x: {x}")
            return x
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_x()
```
