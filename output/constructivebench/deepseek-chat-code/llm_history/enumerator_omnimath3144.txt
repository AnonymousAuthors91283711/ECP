[write_program]
This problem involves computing the limit of an infinite product as x approaches 1 from below. We'll write a Python program to approximate this limit by evaluating the product for values of x close to 1 and for a finite number of terms in the product.

The approach will be:
1. Choose x values approaching 1 (e.g., 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc.)
2. For each x, compute the partial product up to a sufficiently large n
3. Observe how the product behaves as x gets closer to 1

```python
import math

def compute_product(x, max_n=1000):
    """Compute the partial product up to max_n terms"""
    product = 1.0
    for n in range(max_n):
        numerator = 1 + x ** (n + 1)
        denominator = 1 + x ** n
        term = (numerator / denominator) ** (x ** n)
        product *= term
        # Early termination if terms become effectively 1
        if abs(term - 1) < 1e-15:
            break
    return product

# Test values approaching 1 from below
test_values = [0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, 0.99999]

for x in test_values:
    result = compute_product(x)
    print(f"x = {x:.5f}, product â‰ˆ {result:.15f}")

# Output the most precise computation
final_x = 0.999999
final_result = compute_product(final_x, max_n=10000)
print(f"\nFinal approximation with x = {final_x:.6f}: {final_result:.15f}")
```
