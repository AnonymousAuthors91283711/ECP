This problem involves counting the number of ways to remove 4 squares from a 3x3 grid (excluding the start (0,0) and home (2,2) positions) such that there's no path from start to home remaining. The path must move horizontally or vertically between adjacent squares.

We'll enumerate all possible 4-square removals and check the path condition. The 3x3 grid has 9 squares, we must exclude start and home, leaving 7 possible squares to remove 4 from (C(7,4)=35 possibilities).

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_connected(grid, start, target):
    visited = set()
    stack = [start]
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        if (x, y) == target:
            return True
        if (x, y) in visited:
            continue
        visited.add((x, y))
        for dx, dy in [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < 3 and 0 <= ny < 3 and (nx, ny) not in grid:
                stack.append((nx, ny))
    return False

def solve():
    grid = [(x,y) for x in range(3) for y in range(3)]
    start = (0, 0)
    home = (2, 2)
    remaining = [p for p in grid if p != start and p != home]
    
    count = 0
    for removal in combinations(remaining, 4):
        removed = set(removal)
        if not is_connected(removed, start, home):
            count += 1
            print(removal)  # Print each valid removal set
    
    print(f"Total valid removals: {count}")

solve()
```
