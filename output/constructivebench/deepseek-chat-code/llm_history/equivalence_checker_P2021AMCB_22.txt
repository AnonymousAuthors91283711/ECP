Ground Truth Answer: fun walls => walls = [6, 2, 1]

/-- Predicate indicating whether Beth has a winning strategy from given position -/
Proposed Answer: fun walls : List ℕ => match walls with
  | [a, b, c] => (a % 2 = 0 ∧ c = 1) ∨ (b = c ∧ a = b) ∨ (a % 2 = 1 ∧ c = b - 1)
  | _ => False
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth and proposed answers.

The ground truth answer specifies exactly one winning configuration: [6, 2, 1].

The proposed answer gives a more general condition with three cases:
1. (a is even and c = 1)
2. (b = c and a = b)
3. (a is odd and c = b - 1)

Looking at the specific cases in the ground truth:
- [6, 2, 1] matches the first case (6 is even and 1 = 1)
- None of the other listed configurations ([6,1,1], [6,2,2], [6,3,1], [6,3,2]) match any of the proposed conditions

However, the proposed answer would also accept other configurations not in the ground truth, like:
- [4, 2, 1] (first case)
- [5, 6, 5] (second case)
- [7, 4, 3] (third case)

Since the ground truth is specifically only [6,2,1] while the proposed answer accepts many more configurations, they are not equivalent.
