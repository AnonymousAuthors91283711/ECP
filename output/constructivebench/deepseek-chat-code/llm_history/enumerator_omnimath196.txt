[write_program]
This problem involves finding the largest number of pairs of numbers (each pair is a 2-element subset of {1,2,...,2018}) such that all pairwise sumsets are distinct. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of n (number of pairs) and verify the conditions.

The approach:
1. For small n, generate all possible collections of n pairs from {1,...,2018}
2. Check if all pairwise sumsets are distinct
3. Find the maximum n where this is possible

Since the full problem is computationally intensive, we'll demonstrate the approach with smaller parameters (using numbers up to 20 instead of 2018) to show the pattern.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def main():
    max_num = 20  # Using smaller numbers for demonstration
    max_n = 0
    
    # Try increasing values of n until we can't find a valid configuration
    for n in range(1, 10):  # Practical limit for demonstration
        found = False
        # Generate all possible n pairs of numbers from 1 to max_num
        all_numbers = list(range(1, max_num + 1))
        pair_combinations = list(combinations(all_numbers, 2))
        
        # Try combinations of n distinct pairs
        for pairs in combinations(pair_combinations, n):
            sumsets = {}
            valid = True
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(i, n):
                    a, b = pairs[i]
                    c, d = pairs[j]
                    sumset = (a + c, a + d, b + c, b + d)
                    sumset_key = tuple(sorted(sumset))
                    if sumset_key in sumsets:
                        # Check if it's the same pair combination
                        prev_i, prev_j = sumsets[sumset_key]
                        if (i, j) != (prev_i, prev_j):
                            valid = False
                            break
                    else:
                        sumsets[sumset_key] = (i, j)
                if not valid:
                    break
            
            if valid:
                found = True
                print(f"Found valid configuration for n={n}: {pairs}")
                break
        
        if found:
            max_n = n
        else:
            break
    
    print(f"Maximum n found: {max_n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
