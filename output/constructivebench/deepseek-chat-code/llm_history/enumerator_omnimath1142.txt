This problem involves finding three complex numbers z₁, z₂, z₃ that satisfy certain conditions involving their real and imaginary parts, and then computing a specific product involving these numbers. We'll approach this by:

1. Understanding the conditions on real/imaginary parts
2. Finding possible complex numbers that satisfy them
3. Computing the required product

The conditions suggest we're dealing with cube roots or solutions to a cubic equation. We'll search for solutions numerically within a reasonable range.

```python
import cmath
import math

def find_solutions():
    # We'll search for z = x + yi where x and y are in [-20,20] range
    solutions = []
    step = 0.1
    tolerance = 0.01
    
    # Iterate through possible x and y values
    for x in range(-200, 201):
        x_val = x * step
        for y in range(-200, 201):
            y_val = y * step
            if abs(y_val) < 1e-6:  # Avoid division by zero
                continue
                
            # Check both conditions
            cond1 = x_val**3 - 3*x_val*y_val**2 - 2005
            cond2 = y_val**3 - 3*x_val**2*y_val - 2004
            if abs(cond1) < tolerance and abs(cond2) < tolerance:
                z = complex(x_val, y_val)
                solutions.append(z)
                print(f"Found solution: {z}")
    
    return solutions

def compute_product(solutions):
    if len(solutions) < 3:
        print("Need at least 3 solutions to compute product")
        return None
    
    # Take first 3 solutions (problem asks for any three)
    z1, z2, z3 = solutions[:3]
    
    # Compute each term (1 - re(z)/im(z))
    term1 = 1 - z1.real/z1.imag
    term2 = 1 - z2.real/z2.imag
    term3 = 1 - z3.real/z3.imag
    
    product = term1 * term2 * term3
    print(f"Product of terms: {product}")
    return product

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Searching for solutions...")
    sols = find_solutions()
    if len(sols) >= 3:
        compute_product(sols)
    else:
        print("Not enough solutions found")
```
