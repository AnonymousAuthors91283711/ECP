[write_program]
This problem asks for the maximum product of two positive integers that sum to 31. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible pairs (x,y) where x + y = 31 and x,y > 0, then find the pair with the maximum product.

The optimal approach is to check all pairs where x ranges from 1 to 30 (since y = 31-x), compute their products, and track the maximum. The mathematical solution would be x = y = 15.5, but since we need integers, we'll check x=15 and x=16.

```python
def find_max_product():
    max_product = 0
    best_pairs = []
    for x in range(1, 31):
        y = 31 - x
        product = x * y
        if product > max_product:
            max_product = product
            best_pairs = [(x, y)]
        elif product == max_product:
            best_pairs.append((x, y))
        print(f"x={x}, y={y}, product={product}")
    
    print("\nMaximum product pairs:")
    for pair in best_pairs:
        print(f"{pair} with product {max_product}")
    
    return max_product

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = find_max_product()
    print(f"\nThe maximum product is: {result}")
```
