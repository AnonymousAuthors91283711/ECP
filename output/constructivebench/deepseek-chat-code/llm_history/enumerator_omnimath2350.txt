[write_program]
This problem involves counting the number of bit transitions (changes between 0 and 1) in the binary representations of numbers from 0 to 4095 (2^12-1), then finding the average number of transitions per number. We'll write a Python program to compute this average by enumerating all numbers in the range and counting their bit transitions.

The program will:
1. Iterate through numbers 0 to 4095
2. Convert each number to its 12-bit binary representation (with leading zeros)
3. Count transitions between consecutive bits
4. Accumulate the total transitions and compute the average

```python
def count_transitions(binary_str):
    """Count the number of bit transitions in a binary string"""
    transitions = 0
    for i in range(len(binary_str)-1):
        if binary_str[i] != binary_str[i+1]:
            transitions += 1
    return transitions

total_transitions = 0
total_numbers = 4096

for n in range(total_numbers):
    # Convert to 12-bit binary with leading zeros
    binary = f"{n:012b}"
    transitions = count_transitions(binary)
    total_transitions += transitions

average = total_transitions / total_numbers
print(f"Average number of bit transitions: {average}")
```
