[write_program]
This problem asks for the maximum possible value in a strictly increasing sequence of 6 natural numbers where each subsequent number is divisible by the previous one, and the sum of all 6 numbers is exactly 79. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible sequences meeting these conditions and find the maximum value in any such sequence.

The approach will be:
1. Generate all strictly increasing sequences of 6 numbers where each divides the next
2. Filter sequences where the sum equals 79
3. Track the maximum value found in any valid sequence

```python
def find_sequences():
    max_val = 0
    # We'll limit the search space based on the sum constraint
    for a in range(1, 20):
        for b in range(a+1, 40):
            if b % a != 0:
                continue
            for c in range(b+1, 60):
                if c % b != 0:
                    continue
                for d in range(c+1, 70):
                    if d % c != 0:
                        continue
                    for e in range(d+1, 80):
                        if e % d != 0:
                            continue
                        f = 79 - (a + b + c + d + e)
                        if f > e and f % e == 0:
                            sequence = (a, b, c, d, e, f)
                            print(f"Found sequence: {sequence}")
                            if f > max_val:
                                max_val = f
    if max_val > 0:
        print(f"\nMaximum value in any valid sequence: {max_val}")
    else:
        print("No valid sequences found")

find_sequences()
```
