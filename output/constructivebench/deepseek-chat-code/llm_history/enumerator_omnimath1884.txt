[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n where the product of factorials from 1 to n-1 is greater than the square of n factorial. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal n by computing both sides of the inequality for successive values of n.

The approach:
1. Compute factorials iteratively to avoid redundant calculations
2. For each n, calculate the product of factorials from 1 to n-1
3. Compare it with (n!)^2
4. Stop when we find the first n satisfying the condition

```python
import math

def find_min_n():
    # Initialize variables to store running product and factorial
    product = 1  # product of factorials from 1 to n-1
    n_fact = 1   # n factorial
    
    n = 1
    while True:
        n += 1
        # Update n_fact to be (n-1)! first, then multiply by n to get n!
        n_fact *= n
        # The product is product_{k=1}^{n-1} k! = product_{k=1}^{n-2} k! * (n-1)!
        # So we can compute it incrementally
        if n > 2:
            product *= math.factorial(n-1)
        else:
            product = 1  # for n=2, product is 1! = 1
        
        # Compare product with (n!)^2
        rhs = n_fact ** 2
        print(f"n = {n}: product = {product}, (n!)^2 = {rhs}")
        
        if product > rhs:
            print(f"Found minimal n: {n}")
            break

find_min_n()
```
