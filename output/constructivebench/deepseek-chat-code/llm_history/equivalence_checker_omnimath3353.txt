noncomputable abbrev omnimath3353_answer : â„‚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3353 :
  2 * Complex.cos (Real.log 2009 * Complex.I) ^ 2 + Complex.I * Complex.sin (Real.log 4036081 * Complex.I) = omnimath3353_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 4036082 / 4036081
Proposed Answer: 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves complex trigonometric functions with arguments involving logarithms and imaginary units.

2. The ground truth answer is a fraction (4036082/4036081), which is approximately 1.0000002478.

3. The proposed answer is simply 1.

4. While the proposed answer is close in value to the ground truth (differing by about 0.000025%), mathematically they are not equivalent. The exact fraction is not equal to 1.

5. The difference might seem negligible numerically, but in a mathematical proof context where exact values are required, this would be considered incorrect.

Therefore, the correct judgment is:

<<<False>>>
