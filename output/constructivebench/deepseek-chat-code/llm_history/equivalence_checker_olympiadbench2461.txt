Ground Truth Answer: (log 2) / (log 2 - log 3)
Proposed Answer: -(log 9 / log (2/9))
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground truth: (log 2) / (log 2 - log 3)
Proposed: -(log 9 / log (2/9))

Let's simplify the proposed answer:
1. log 9 = 2 log 3
2. log (2/9) = log 2 - log 9 = log 2 - 2 log 3
3. So proposed becomes: -(2 log 3)/(log 2 - 2 log 3)

Now let's simplify ground truth:
(log 2)/(log 2 - log 3)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -1:
(-log 2)/(-log 2 + log 3) = (-log 2)/(log 3 - log 2)

The two expressions are different:
- Proposed: -(2 log 3)/(log 2 - 2 log 3)
- Ground truth: (log 2)/(log 2 - log 3)

They are not algebraically equivalent. The proposed answer is incorrect.
