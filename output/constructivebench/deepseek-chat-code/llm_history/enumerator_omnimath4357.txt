[write_program]
This problem asks for the maximum size of a family of subsets of {1,2,...,n} where:
1. Each set A_i has size i+1
2. No two distinct sets are comparable by inclusion (no A_i is a subset of A_j)

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values for small n (starting from n=4) to help conjecture the pattern.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def max_family_size(n):
    # Generate all possible families of subsets satisfying the conditions
    max_size = 0
    universe = set(range(n))
    
    # We'll try building families incrementally
    # The family must contain one set of each size from 1 to m+1 (since A_i has size i+1)
    for m in range(1, n):
        # Check if we can have a family of size m
        possible = False
        # Generate candidate sets for each required size
        sets_by_size = {}
        for i in range(m):
            size = i + 1
            sets_by_size[size] = list(combinations(universe, size))
        
        # Try to find a selection with one set from each size, no inclusions
        from itertools import product
        for candidate in product(*[sets_by_size[size] for size in range(1, m+1)]):
            valid = True
            # Check all pairs for inclusion
            for i in range(m):
                for j in range(i+1, m):
                    set_i = set(candidate[i])
                    set_j = set(candidate[j])
                    if set_i.issubset(set_j) or set_j.issubset(set_i):
                        valid = False
                        break
                if not valid:
                    break
            if valid:
                possible = True
                break
        if possible:
            max_size = m
            print(f"For n={n}, found family size {m}")
        else:
            break
    return max_size

# Test for small values of n
for n in range(4, 8):
    print(f"\nTesting n={n}")
    result = max_family_size(n)
    print(f"Maximum family size for n={n}: {result}")
```
