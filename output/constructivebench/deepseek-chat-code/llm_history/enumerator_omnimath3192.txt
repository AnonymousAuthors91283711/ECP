This problem appears to be about finding the number of points needed in the next game to satisfy a certain equation, given a relationship between previous games and points. The mathematical formulation suggests we need to find `nextPoints` such that the equation holds.

We'll approach this by:
1. Solving the given equation for `previousGames`
2. Using that value to compute `nextPoints` from the second equation
3. Enumerating possible values to verify the solution

Here's the Python program to find and verify the solution:

```python
def solve():
    # First solve 20*previousGames + 36 = 21*(previousGames + 1)
    # 20p + 36 = 21p + 21 => p = 15
    previousGames = 15
    
    # Now compute nextPoints from:
    # 20*previousGames + 36 + nextPoints = 22*(previousGames + 2)
    lhs = 20 * previousGames + 36
    rhs = 22 * (previousGames + 2)
    nextPoints = rhs - lhs
    
    print(f"previousGames = {previousGames}")
    print(f"nextPoints needed = {nextPoints}")
    
    # Verification
    assert 20 * previousGames + 36 == 21 * (previousGames + 1)
    assert lhs + nextPoints == rhs

solve()
```
