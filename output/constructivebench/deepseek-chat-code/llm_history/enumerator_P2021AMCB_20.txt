This problem involves polynomial division with remainder, where we need to find the remainder R when dividing X^5 + X^4 + X^3 + X^2 + X + 1 by X^2 - X + 1. The remainder must satisfy degree R < 2 and be unique.

We'll approach this by:
1. Performing polynomial long division symbolically
2. Enumerating possible remainders of degree < 2 (linear polynomials)
3. Verifying which remainder satisfies the division equation

```python
def multiply_poly(p1, p2):
    """Multiply two polynomials represented as coefficient lists"""
    result = [0] * (len(p1) + len(p2) - 1)
    for i in range(len(p1)):
        for j in range(len(p2)):
            result[i+j] += p1[i] * p2[j]
    return result

def add_poly(p1, p2):
    """Add two polynomials represented as coefficient lists"""
    max_len = max(len(p1), len(p2))
    result = [0] * max_len
    for i in range(len(p1)):
        result[i] += p1[i]
    for i in range(len(p2)):
        result[i] += p2[i]
    return result

def poly_to_str(p):
    """Convert polynomial coefficient list to string representation"""
    terms = []
    for power, coeff in enumerate(p):
        if coeff == 0:
            continue
        if power == 0:
            terms.append(f"{coeff}")
        else:
            terms.append(f"{coeff if coeff != 1 else ''}X^{power}" if power > 1 else f"{coeff if coeff != 1 else ''}X")
    return " + ".join(terms) if terms else "0"

# Dividend: X^5 + X^4 + X^3 + X^2 + X + 1
dividend = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
# Divisor: X^2 - X + 1
divisor = [1, -1, 1]

# We'll test all possible remainders of degree < 2: aX + b where a,b are integers
# We'll limit coefficients to reasonable range since the actual answer is likely simple
for a in range(-5, 6):
    for b in range(-5, 6):
        remainder = [b, a]  # represents aX + b
        # Compute (divisor)*Q + remainder and check if equals dividend
        # Since degree(R) < 2, degree(Q) must be 3 (5-2)
        # Try Q = cX^3 + dX^2 + eX + f
        for c in [1]:  # leading coefficient must match (1X^5 / 1X^2 = 1X^3)
            for d in [2]:  # educated guess based on polynomial division steps
                for e in [1]:  # educated guess
                    for f in [0]:  # educated guess
                        Q = [f, e, d, c]
                        product = multiply_poly(divisor, Q)
                        total = add_poly(product, remainder)
                        if total == dividend:
                            print(f"Found valid remainder: {poly_to_str(remainder)}")
                            print(f"With Q = {poly_to_str(Q)}")
                            exit()

print("No remainder found in the tested range")
