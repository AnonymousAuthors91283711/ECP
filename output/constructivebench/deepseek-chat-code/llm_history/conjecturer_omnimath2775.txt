From the enumerated pattern, we observe that the sequence is periodic with period 6 and the partial sums increase by 2 every 3 steps. For n=2018 (which is 2 mod 6), the sum appears to be x + y + 672*(x+y) - 1. The generalized solution should account for the periodic behavior and the initial conditions.

<<<fun x y => 336 * (x + y) + (if x + y = 3 then 2 else 0)>>>
