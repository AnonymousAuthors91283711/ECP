[write_program]
This problem involves algebraic manipulation of rational expressions in two variables x and y. The goal is to find a relationship between the given expression in terms of x^2 and y^2 (equal to k) and another expression in terms of x^8 and y^8.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Symbolically verify the relationship for small integer values of x and y
2. Attempt to find a pattern between k and the target expression
3. Output the results for inspection

The program will use sympy for symbolic computation to handle exact rational values.

```python
from sympy import symbols, simplify, cancel, expand, Eq, solve

def compute_k(x, y):
    """Compute k = (x²+y²)/(x²-y²) + (x²-y²)/(x²+y²)"""
    x_sq = x**2
    y_sq = y**2
    term1 = (x_sq + y_sq) / (x_sq - y_sq)
    term2 = (x_sq - y_sq) / (x_sq + y_sq)
    return term1 + term2

def compute_target(x, y):
    """Compute target expression: (x⁸+y⁸)/(x⁸-y⁸) - (x⁸-y⁸)/(x⁸+y⁸)"""
    x_8 = x**8
    y_8 = y**8
    term1 = (x_8 + y_8) / (x_8 - y_8)
    term2 = (x_8 - y_8) / (x_8 + y_8)
    return term1 - term2

def main():
    x, y = symbols('x y')
    # Test with small integer values where denominators don't vanish
    for a in range(1, 5):
        for b in range(1, 5):
            if a == b:
                continue  # avoid division by zero
            k_val = compute_k(a, b)
            target_val = compute_target(a, b)
            simplified_k = cancel(k_val)
            simplified_target = cancel(target_val)
            print(f"x={a}, y={b}: k = {simplified_k}, target = {simplified_target}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program outputs pairs (x,y) with their corresponding k values and target expression values. By examining these outputs, we can look for a pattern relating k to the target expression. The mathematical solution would involve algebraic manipulation to express the target purely in terms of k.
