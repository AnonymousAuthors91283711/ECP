Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ A B : ℚ, ∀ x, f x = A * x + B}
Proposed Answer: { f | ∃ a b : ℚ, ∀ x : ℚ, f x = a * x + b }
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer and the ground truth answer are equivalent. Both describe the set of all linear functions from ℚ to ℚ, where the function can be expressed as f(x) = A*x + B (ground truth) or f(x) = a*x + b (proposed). The only difference is the choice of variable names (A,B vs a,b), which doesn't affect the mathematical meaning. Both answers correctly characterize the solutions to the given functional equation.
