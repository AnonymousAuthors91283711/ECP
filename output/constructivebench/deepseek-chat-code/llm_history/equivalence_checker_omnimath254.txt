Ground Truth Answer: 502
Proposed Answer: 1004
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal number of integers k between 1 and 2011 where (a*k mod 2012) > (b*k mod 2012) for some distinct a,b in 1..2011.

2. The key observations:
   - 2012 = 4 × 503 (factorization)
   - The minimal case occurs when a and b differ by exactly 503 (the largest prime factor)
   - For such pairs, the inequality holds for exactly 1/4 of the numbers (502 times)

3. The ground truth answer (502) is correct because:
   - When a ≡ b + 503 mod 2012, the inequality holds for exactly 502 values of k
   - This is provably minimal for this type of problem

4. The proposed answer (1004) is incorrect because:
   - It's exactly double the correct answer
   - This would correspond to 1/2 of the numbers, which doesn't match the minimal case
   - The proposed answer doesn't align with the mathematical analysis of the problem
