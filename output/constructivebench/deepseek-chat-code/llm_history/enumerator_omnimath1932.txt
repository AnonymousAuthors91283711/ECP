[write_program]
This problem asks us to find the least value among three given real numbers. The numbers are:
1. 54√3
2. 144
3. 108√6 - 108√2

We'll compute each value numerically to compare them and find the smallest one. The program will calculate and print each value with sufficient precision for comparison.

```python
import math

def main():
    # Calculate each expression
    val1 = 54 * math.sqrt(3)
    val2 = 144
    val3 = 108 * math.sqrt(6) - 108 * math.sqrt(2)
    
    # Print all values for comparison
    print(f"54√3 ≈ {val1:.15f}")
    print(f"144 = {val2:.15f}")
    print(f"108√6 - 108√2 ≈ {val3:.15f}")
    
    # Find and print the minimum value
    min_val = min(val1, val2, val3)
    print(f"\nThe smallest value is approximately {min_val:.15f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
