Ground Truth Answer: 43/48
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the value of k that satisfies a system of two logarithmic equations with constraints on x and y.

2. The ground truth answer is 43/48 ≈ 0.8958

3. The proposed answer is 4

The difference between these answers is substantial (0.8958 vs 4). The proposed answer is off by a factor of more than 4 times the correct value. 

Given that the ground truth answer has been verified mathematically (as 43/48) and the proposed answer is significantly different, we can conclude they are not equivalent.
