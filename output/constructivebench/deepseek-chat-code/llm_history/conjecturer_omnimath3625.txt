abbrev omnimath3625_answer : Set (ℤ × ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3625 (m n : ℤ) : 
  m^5 - n^5 = 16 * m * n ↔ (m, n) ∈ omnimath3625_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for solutions in range [-100, 100]
Found solution: (m, n) = (-2, 2). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ)
<<<{(2, -2), (-2, 2), (0, 0)}>>>
