Looking at the problem, we're asked to count the number of ways to tile a 3×5 grid using specific tile patterns (horizontal and vertical strips). The enumerated answer shows 0 tilings exist. This makes sense because:

1. The grid has 15 cells (3×5)
2. All allowed tiles are either full-width horizontal strips or full-height vertical strips
3. It's impossible to partition a 3×5 grid completely using only such strips without overlaps or gaps
