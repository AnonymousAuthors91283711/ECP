[write_program]
This problem asks to count integer pairs (x,y) where x and y are between -100 and 100 inclusive, satisfying the equation 12x² - xy - 6y² = 0. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such pairs efficiently.

The approach:
1. Iterate x from -100 to 100
2. For each x, solve the quadratic equation for y: -6y² - xy + 12x² = 0
3. Check if the discriminant is a perfect square
4. If yes, calculate possible y values and check if they're integers within [-100,100]

```python
def solve():
    count = 0
    for x in range(-100, 101):
        if x == 0:
            # When x=0, equation becomes -6y²=0 ⇒ y=0
            count += 1
            print(f"(0, 0)")
            continue
        
        # Coefficients of quadratic in y: a=-6, b=-x, c=12x²
        a = -6
        b = -x
        c = 12 * x * x
        discriminant = b*b - 4*a*c
        
        if discriminant < 0:
            continue
        
        sqrt_discriminant = int(round(discriminant**0.5))
        if sqrt_discriminant * sqrt_discriminant != discriminant:
            continue
        
        # Possible y values
        y1 = (-b + sqrt_discriminant) / (2*a)
        y2 = (-b - sqrt_discriminant) / (2*a)
        
        for y in [y1, y2]:
            if y == int(y) and -100 <= y <= 100:
                count += 1
                print(f"({x}, {int(y)})")
    
    print(f"Total solutions: {count}")

solve()
```
