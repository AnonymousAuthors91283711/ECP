This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n where (n+1)/(2n+1) < 1/100. We'll solve it by testing successive values of n until the condition is met.

The inequality can be rewritten as:
100(n+1) < 2n+1
100n + 100 < 2n + 1
98n < -99
n < -99/98

This suggests no positive integer satisfies the inequality, but let's verify computationally since the problem implies a solution exists. We'll test values up to n=1000 to be thorough.

```python
def find_min_n():
    for n in range(1, 1001):
        if (n + 1) / (2 * n + 1) < 1 / 100:
            print(f"Found candidate: {n}")
            return n
    print("No solution found in range 1-1000")
    return None

find_min_n()
```

The program will quickly determine that no positive integer n satisfies the condition, as the left side is always greater than 1/2 for n â‰¥ 1. This suggests either:
1. The inequality was meant to be reversed, or
2. There's a different interpretation of the problem

For completeness, we output that no solution was found in the tested range.
