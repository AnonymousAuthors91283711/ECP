Running for n_rows=1993, n_cols=4:

Final max size: 5979. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the error message, we see that the proposed answer was incorrectly defined as a function when it should be a concrete natural number. The enumerated answers show:
- For n_rows=5, max size=15 (which is 3*5)
- For n_rows=1993, max size=5979 (which is 3*1993)

The pattern suggests the answer is simply 3 times the number of rows (1993 in this problem). The "-2" in the original proposal was incorrect based on the enumerated cases.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<3 * 1993>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem asks for the maximum size of a subset T of a grid with 1993 rows and 4 columns that avoids certain geometric configurations.
2. The enumerated answers show a clear pattern of 3*n_rows for both small (n_rows=5) and large (n_rows=1993) cases.
3. The original proposal incorrectly subtracted 2, which doesn't match the enumerated patterns.
4. Since the problem is specifically about 1993 rows and 4 columns, we give the concrete answer rather than a general function.
