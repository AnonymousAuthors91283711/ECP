[write_program]
This problem involves finding the ratio of p₃ to the sum of p₀ through p₃, given a geometric progression condition. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values and observe the pattern.

The key observations:
1. The sequence follows p_{i+1} = 2*p_i
2. All p_i are distinct and positive
3. We can express all terms in terms of p₀

The program will:
1. Calculate the ratio for small integer values of p₀
2. Observe the pattern in the resulting ratios
3. Output exact fractions when possible

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def calculate_ratio(p0):
    p1 = 2 * p0
    p2 = 2 * p1
    p3 = 2 * p2
    total = p0 + p1 + p2 + p3
    ratio = Fraction(p3, total)
    return ratio

# Test small integer values of p0
for p0 in range(1, 6):
    ratio = calculate_ratio(p0)
    print(f"p0 = {p0}: {ratio} = {float(ratio)}")

# The pattern suggests the ratio is always 8/15
# Let's verify with one more value
p0 = Fraction(1, 3)  # non-integer test
ratio = calculate_ratio(p0)
print(f"p0 = {p0}: {ratio} = {float(ratio)}")
```
