[write_program]
This problem involves finding the roots of a complex polynomial equation. We'll write a Python program to find all complex roots of the polynomial z^5 - 5*z^4 + 11*z^3 - 13*z^2 + 9*z - 3 = 0. We'll use numpy's roots function to compute the roots numerically, then print them with reasonable precision.

```python
import numpy as np

# Coefficients of the polynomial z^5 - 5*z^4 + 11*z^3 - 13*z^2 + 9*z - 3 = 0
coeffs = [1, -5, 11, -13, 9, -3]

# Compute the roots using numpy's roots function
roots = np.roots(coeffs)

# Print each root with 6 decimal places precision
print("Roots of the polynomial z^5 - 5*z^4 + 11*z^3 - 13*z^2 + 9*z - 3 = 0:")
for i, root in enumerate(roots, 1):
    print(f"Root {i}: {root.real:.6f} + {root.imag:.6f}i")
```
