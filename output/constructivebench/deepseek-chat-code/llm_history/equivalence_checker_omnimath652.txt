theorem omnimath652 (x y : ℕ) : 
  3^x * 4^y = 2^(x + y) + 2^(2*(x + y) - 1) ↔ (x, y) ∈ omnimath652_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 2)} ∪ {(n, n) | n ≥ 3}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation is 3^x * 4^y = 2^(x+y) + 2^(2*(x+y)-1)
2. The ground truth gives exactly 3 solutions: (0,1), (1,1), (2,2)
3. The proposed answer includes these 3 solutions plus all pairs where x=y≥3

Testing the proposed additional solutions (n,n) for n≥3:
For n=3: 3^3 * 4^3 = 27*64 = 1728
Right side: 2^(6) + 2^(11) = 64 + 2048 = 2112 ≠ 1728
This doesn't satisfy the equation.

Similarly for n=4: 3^4 * 4^4 = 81*256 = 20736
Right side: 2^8 + 2^15 = 256 + 32768 = 33024 ≠ 20736

The proposed answer incorrectly includes additional pairs that don't satisfy the equation. Only the ground truth answer is correct.
