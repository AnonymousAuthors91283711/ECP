The error occurs because Lean requires explicit marking of noncomputable real number operations. The solution is to add the `noncomputable` modifier and use exact division (/) rather than integer division (//). Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2014AMCB_3_answer : ℝ := 300 / 7>>>

Explanation:
1. The equation x/3 + 20 + x/5 = x simplifies to x*(1/3 + 1/5 - 1) = -20, which gives x = 300/7
2. We must use `/` for real division in Lean (not `//` which is integer division)
3. The `noncomputable` modifier is needed because real number division in Lean is noncomputable in general
4. The enumerated answers confirm 300/7 is the exact solution (≈42.857143)
5. The answer type is correctly specified as ℝ (real numbers)[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Based on the problem statement and error message, we need to provide a real number solution to the equation x/3 + 20 + x/5 = x. The enumerated answers show the exact solution is 300/7. The error occurs because Lean needs explicit casting for division of natural numbers to reals.

Here's the fixed answer using the correct real number division syntax in Lean:

<<<(300 : ℝ) / 7>>>

Explanation:
1. The equation simplifies to x - x/3 - x/5 = 20 → (15x - 5x - 3x)/15 = 20 → 7x/15 = 20 → x = 300/7
2. We wrap 300 in parentheses with type annotation (300 : ℝ) to ensure real number division
3. The division operator / then works properly in the real number context
4. This matches both the exact fractional solution (300/7) and the numerical approximation (≈42.857)[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error occurs because Lean requires explicit marking of noncomputable definitions involving real numbers. The proposed answer (300/7) is correct based on solving the equation, but needs proper noncomputable annotation. Here's the fixed version:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2014AMCB_3_answer : ℝ := 300 / 7>>>

Explanation:
1. The equation x/3 + 20 + x/5 = x simplifies to:
   (1/3 + 1/5 - 1)x = -20
   (8/15 - 1)x = -20
   (-7/15)x = -20
   x = 20 * 15/7 = 300/7

2. The enumerated answers confirm this exact fraction (300/7 ≈ 42.857143).

3. The noncomputable annotation is needed because:
   - Real number division isn't computable in Lean
   - This is a common requirement for real-valued definitions
   - Doesn't affect the mathematical correctness, just Lean's compilation[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
