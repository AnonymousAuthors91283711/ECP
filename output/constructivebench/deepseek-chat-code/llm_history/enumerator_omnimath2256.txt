This problem involves calculating the expected number of games in a competition between Alice and Bob, where Alice needs to win 11 games and Bob needs to win 10 games (since n=21). The expected number of games is given by the sum of harmonic series terms. We'll write a Python program to compute this exact rational value.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    n = 21
    alice = 11
    # Calculate the two harmonic sums
    sum1 = sum(Fraction(1, k+1) for k in range(alice-1))
    sum2 = sum(Fraction(1, k+1) for k in range(n-alice))
    expected_games = sum1 + sum2
    print(f"Expected number of games: {expected_games}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
