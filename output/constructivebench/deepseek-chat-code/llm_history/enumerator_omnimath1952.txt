The problem asks for the number of integers `n` between 1 and 91 (inclusive) such that `gcd(n, 91) = d` for some fixed `d`. Since the exact value of `d` isn't specified in the problem statement, we'll enumerate all possible gcd values and their counts.

We'll:
1. Factorize 91 = 7 × 13
2. Consider all divisors of 91: 1, 7, 13, 91
3. For each divisor d, count numbers n in 1..91 where gcd(n,91)=d
4. The count for d is φ(91/d) where φ is Euler's totient function

```python
import math

def euler_phi(n):
    result = n
    p = 2
    while p * p <= n:
        if n % p == 0:
            while n % p == 0:
                n = n // p
            result -= result // p
        p += 1
    if n > 1:
        result -= result // n
    return result

def main():
    N = 91
    factors = [7, 13]  # prime factors of 91
    divisors = [1, 7, 13, 91]  # all divisors
    
    print("Possible gcd values and their counts:")
    for d in divisors:
        count = euler_phi(N // d)
        print(f"gcd(n,91)={d}: {count} numbers")
    
    # For verification, show the sum equals 91
    total = sum(euler_phi(N // d) for d in divisors)
    print(f"\nVerification: sum of counts = {total} (should equal {N})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
