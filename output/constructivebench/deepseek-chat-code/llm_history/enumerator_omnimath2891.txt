[write_program]
This problem is about finding the product of (total_doctors - 1) and (total_nurses - 1) when total_doctors = 6 and total_nurses = 4. The solution is straightforward since the values are given, but we'll write a Python program to compute it systematically.

The program will:
1. Define the given constants (6 doctors and 4 nurses)
2. Calculate d = doctors - 1 and n = nurses - 1
3. Compute and print the product d * n

```python
# Problem parameters
total_doctors = 6
total_nurses = 4

# Calculate d and n
d = total_doctors - 1
n = total_nurses - 1

# Compute and print the product
print(d * n)
```
