[write_program]
This problem asks for the largest integer n such that any 10-element subset of [4..n] contains three numbers that can form a triangle (satisfy the triangle inequality). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of n and check the condition.

The approach:
1. For each candidate n starting from a reasonable lower bound
2. Generate all 10-element subsets of [4..n]
3. Check if each subset contains a triangle triple
4. Find the largest n where all subsets satisfy the condition

```python
import itertools

def has_triangle_triple(subset):
    # Check all 3-element combinations in the subset
    for triple in itertools.combinations(subset, 3):
        a, b, c = sorted(triple)
        if a + b > c:  # Triangle inequality
            return True
    return False

def test_n(n):
    numbers = list(range(4, n+1))
    # Check all 10-element subsets
    for subset in itertools.combinations(numbers, 10):
        if not has_triangle_triple(subset):
            return False
    return True

# Start checking from reasonable values (problem suggests n >= 4 + 10 - 1 = 13)
# We know from combinatorics that the answer is likely between 20 and 30
max_valid_n = 0
for n in range(20, 30):
    if test_n(n):
        max_valid_n = n
        print(f"Valid n found: {n}")

print(f"Maximum valid n: {max_valid_n}")
```

Note: The actual implementation would need optimizations to handle the combinatorial explosion (there are C(n-3,10) subsets to check). For a complete solution, we'd need mathematical insights to reduce the search space, but this shows the enumeration approach. The ground truth answer is known in competition math circles but isn't revealed here.
