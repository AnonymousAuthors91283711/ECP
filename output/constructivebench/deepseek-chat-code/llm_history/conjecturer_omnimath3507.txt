abbrev omnimath3507_answer : String := sorry
theorem omnimath3507 (graph : String) : 
  (∃ (f : ℝ → ℝ), (∀ x y, f x = f y) ∧ graph = omnimath3507_answer) ↔ graph = omnimath3507_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Constant function f(x) = 0
Graph representation: Horizontal line at y=0
---
Constant function f(x) = 1
Graph representation: Horizontal line at y=1
---
Constant function f(x) = -1
Graph representation: Horizontal line at y=-1
---
Constant function f(x) = 2
Graph representation: Horizontal line at y=2
---
Constant function f(x) = 0.5
Graph representation: Horizontal line at y=0.5
---
Constant function f(x) = -0.5
Graph representation: Horizontal line at y=-0.5
---
Constant function f(x) = 3.14
Graph representation: Horizontal line at y=3.14
