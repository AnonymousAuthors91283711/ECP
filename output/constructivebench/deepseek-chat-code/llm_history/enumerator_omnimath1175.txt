This problem involves counting the number of functions from Fin 2010 to (Fin 2 → Fin 2) (i.e., Boolean functions) where the composition of all functions in any order results in a constant function. We'll enumerate smaller cases to find a pattern.

The key observation is that the composition of Boolean functions (f: Fin 2 → Fin 2) forms a monoid where the only idempotent elements are the constant functions and the identity function. For the fold to be constant, the composition must result in one of the two constant functions.

We'll enumerate for small n (replacing 2010) to find a pattern, then generalize.

```python
def count_constant_compositions(n):
    """
    Counts the number of sequences of n boolean functions whose composition is constant.
    A boolean function is represented as a tuple (f(0), f(1)) where f(0), f(1) are in {0,1}.
    """
    # The two constant functions: const0 = (0,0), const1 = (1,1)
    # The identity function: id = (0,1)
    # The negation function: neg = (1,0)
    
    # The composition is constant iff the product contains at least one constant function
    # So total = 4^n - (number of sequences with no constant functions)
    # Sequences without constants can only use id and neg
    
    # The product of id and neg is:
    # id ∘ id = id
    # id ∘ neg = neg
    # neg ∘ id = neg
    # neg ∘ neg = id
    # So the product of any sequence of id and neg is either id or neg
    
    # Therefore, sequences without constants are 2^n (all possible combinations of id/neg)
    # But we must subtract the cases where the product is id (since we only want constant)
    # Wait no - the problem requires the product to be constant
    
    # Actually, the only way the product is constant is if at least one function is constant
    # Because id and neg can't produce a constant through composition
    
    total = 4**n
    non_constant_only = 2**n  # all functions are either id or neg
    return total - non_constant_only

# Enumerate small cases to see the pattern
for n in range(1, 6):
    print(f"n={n}: {count_constant_compositions(n)}")

# The pattern is clearly 4^n - 2^n
# For n=2010, the answer would be 4^2010 - 2^2010
# But since we can't compute that directly, we output the formula
print("\nFor n=2010, the answer is 4^2010 - 2^2010")
```
