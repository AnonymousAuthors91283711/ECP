[write_program]
The problem is to compute the sum of binomial coefficients C(10, i) for i from 0 to 10. This is a well-known combinatorial identity where the sum equals 2^10. We'll write a Python program to verify this by computing the sum directly.

```python
import math

def compute_sum():
    total = 0
    for i in range(11):  # from 0 to 10 inclusive
        comb = math.comb(10, i)
        print(f"C(10, {i}) = {comb}")
        total += comb
    print(f"Total sum: {total}")
    print(f"2^10 = {2**10}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_sum()
```
