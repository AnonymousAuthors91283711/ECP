[write_program]
This problem asks for natural numbers n that can be expressed as n = p²qr where p, q, r are primes, and Euler's totient function φ(n) equals 11³ + 1 (which is 1332). We'll write a Python program to find all such numbers n by:

1. Generating possible prime combinations p,q,r
2. Calculating n = p²qr
3. Computing φ(n) = p(p-1)(q-1)(r-1)
4. Checking if φ(n) = 1332

We'll limit our search to primes up to 100 since larger primes would make n too big (φ(n) grows rapidly).

```python
import sympy

def compute_phi(p, q, r):
    """Compute Euler's totient for n = p^2 * q * r"""
    return p * (p - 1) * (q - 1) * (r - 1)

target = 11**3 + 1  # 1332
max_prime = 100

# Generate all primes up to max_prime
primes = list(sympy.primerange(2, max_prime + 1))

found = False
# Iterate through all combinations of p, q, r
for p in primes:
    for q in primes:
        if q == p:
            continue
        for r in primes:
            if r == p or r == q:
                continue
            phi = compute_phi(p, q, r)
            if phi == target:
                n = p**2 * q * r
                print(f"Found n = {n} = {p}^2 * {q} * {r} with φ(n) = {phi}")
                found = True

if not found:
    print("No solutions found in the search range")
```
