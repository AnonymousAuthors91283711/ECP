[write_program]
This problem asks to find all pairs of natural numbers (n, k) where n ≥ k and k!! * (n-k)!! divides n!!. We'll write a Python program to enumerate such pairs up to a reasonable threshold (n ≤ 20) to identify patterns.

The program will:
1. Compute double factorials efficiently
2. Check the divisibility condition for all n ≥ k
3. Print valid pairs as they're found
4. Use memoization to optimize repeated calculations

```python
def double_factorial(x):
    """Compute x!! = x*(x-2)*...*1 or 2 depending on parity"""
    if x < 0:
        return 1
    result = 1
    while x > 0:
        result *= x
        x -= 2
    return result

max_n = 20
print(f"Checking pairs (n,k) with n ≤ {max_n} where k!!*(n-k)!! divides n!!")

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    n_df = double_factorial(n)
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        k_df = double_factorial(k)
        n_minus_k_df = double_factorial(n - k)
        if n_df % (k_df * n_minus_k_df) == 0:
            print(f"Found valid pair: ({n}, {k})")
```
