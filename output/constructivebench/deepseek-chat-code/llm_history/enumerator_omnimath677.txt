[write_program]
This problem involves summing binomial coefficients where the index is congruent to 1 modulo 3. We'll write a Python program to compute this sum for small values of n to identify a pattern. The program will calculate the sum for n up to a reasonable threshold (say 20) and print the results.

```python
from math import comb
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_sum(n):
    """Compute the sum of binomial coefficients C(n,k) where k â‰¡ 1 mod 3"""
    total = Fraction(0)
    for k in range(n + 1):
        if k % 3 == 1:
            total += Fraction(comb(n, k))
    return total

def main():
    max_n = 20
    print(f"Computing sums for n from 0 to {max_n}:")
    for n in range(max_n + 1):
        result = compute_sum(n)
        print(f"n = {n}: {result} (approx {float(result):.4f})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
