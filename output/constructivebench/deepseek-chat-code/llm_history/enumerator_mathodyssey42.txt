[write_program]
This problem asks for the count of integer values α (with |α| ≤ 2005) such that there exist integers x and y satisfying the system:
x² = y + α
y² = x + α

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such α values within a smaller range first (say |α| ≤ 20) to understand the pattern, then extend to the full range.

The approach:
1. For each α in the range, check all possible x and y that could satisfy the equations
2. The equations imply x² - y² = y - x, which can be factored to (x-y)(x+y+1) = 0
3. This gives two cases: x = y or x = -y - 1
4. For each case, substitute back to find possible α values

```python
def find_alpha_values(max_abs_alpha=20):
    results = set()
    # Case 1: x = y
    for x in range(-100, 100):
        alpha = x**2 - x
        if abs(alpha) <= max_abs_alpha:
            results.add(alpha)
    
    # Case 2: x = -y - 1
    for y in range(-100, 100):
        x = -y - 1
        alpha = x**2 - y
        if abs(alpha) <= max_abs_alpha:
            results.add(alpha)
    
    # Print sorted results for small range
    if max_abs_alpha <= 20:
        print(f"For |α| ≤ {max_abs_alpha}, found α values:")
        for alpha in sorted(results):
            print(alpha)
        print(f"Total count: {len(results)}")
    return results

# First examine small range to understand pattern
small_results = find_alpha_values(20)

# Now compute for full range (2005)
full_results = find_alpha_values(2005)
print(f"For |α| ≤ 2005, total count: {len(full_results)}")
```
