This problem appears to be calculating a probability where there are 4^8 total outcomes and 1225 successful outcomes. The goal is to find the simplified form of the fraction 1225/4^8. Here's a Python program to simplify this fraction and find its exact value:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def simplify_fraction():
    total_outcomes = 4 ** 8
    successful_outcomes = 1225
    fraction = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes)
    print(f"Simplified fraction: {fraction}")
    print(f"Decimal approximation: {float(fraction)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    simplify_fraction()
```
