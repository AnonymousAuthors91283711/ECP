Based on the problem statement, we need to find even numbers n < 100 where we can partition the set {1,...,n} into three disjoint subsets A (odd numbers), B (even numbers), and C (multiples of 3) with equal sums. The key observation is that this is only possible when n is congruent to 0 modulo 12, as this ensures the sums can balance.
