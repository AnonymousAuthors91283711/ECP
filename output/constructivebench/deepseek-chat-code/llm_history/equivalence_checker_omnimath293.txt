Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 2), (1, 3), (3, 3)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, n) | n > 1} ∪ {(n, 1) | n > 1} ∪ {(n, n + 1) | n > 0} ∪ {(n + 1, n) | n > 0}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding pairs (a,b) of natural numbers where certain divisibility conditions hold for a³b-1 and b³a+1.

2. The ground truth gives specific pairs: (2,2), (1,3), (3,3)

3. The proposed answer suggests:
   - All pairs where a=1 and b>1
   - All pairs where b=1 and a>1
   - All pairs where b=a+1
   - All pairs where a=b+1

Testing the proposed answer against ground truth:
- (2,2): Not in proposed answer (should be in since 2≠1 and 2≠2±1)
- (1,3): In proposed answer (a=1, b>1)
- (3,3): Not in proposed answer (should be in since 3≠1 and 3≠3±1)

The proposed answer misses (2,2) and (3,3) which should be included, and includes many pairs (like (1,2), (1,4), etc.) that aren't in the ground truth.
