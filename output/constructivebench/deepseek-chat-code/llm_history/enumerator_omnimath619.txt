This problem asks for the number of natural numbers k such that there exist positive integers a and b where k*(a+b) = 2013*lcm(a,b). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible k values by checking small a and b pairs.

The approach:
1. Factorize 2013 = 3 × 11 × 61
2. For small a and b values (up to a reasonable limit), compute k = (2013*lcm(a,b))/(a+b)
3. Collect all integer k values found
4. Count the distinct valid k values

```python
import math
from fractions import gcd

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def solve():
    max_ab = 2000  # Reasonable limit to find all possible k
    k_values = set()
    
    for a in range(1, max_ab + 1):
        for b in range(1, max_ab + 1):
            numerator = 2013 * lcm(a, b)
            denominator = a + b
            if numerator % denominator == 0:
                k = numerator // denominator
                k_values.add(k)
    
    # Print all found k values
    for k in sorted(k_values):
        print(k)
    
    # Print the count of distinct k values
    print("\nTotal distinct k values found:", len(k_values))

solve()
```
[refine_program]
Let me analyze the problem and the program:

1. Problem Analysis:
- We need to find all natural numbers k such that there exist positive integers a,b where k*(a+b) = 2013*lcm(a,b)
- The problem is about counting the number of distinct k values that satisfy this condition

2. Program Issues:
- The program uses gcd from fractions which is incorrect (should use math.gcd)
- The max_ab limit of 2000 might be too small to find any solutions
- The program doesn't handle the case where a and b are not coprime properly
- The output shows no results, indicating the search space is insufficient

3. Correct Approach:
- We should use math.gcd
- Increase the search space (max_ab)
- Optimize by iterating through coprime pairs first
- The equation can be rewritten to show k = 2013*lcm(a,b)/(a+b)

Judgement: The original program fails to find any solutions due to implementation issues and insufficient search space.

<<<False>>>

Here's the corrected program:

```python
import math
from math import gcd

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def solve():
    max_ab = 10000  # Increased search space
    k_values = set()
    
    for a in range(1, max_ab + 1):
        for b in range(1, max_ab + 1):
            denom = a + b
            if denom == 0:
                continue
            numerator = 2013 * lcm(a, b)
            if numerator % denom == 0:
                k = numerator // denom
                k_values.add(k)
                print(k)  # Stream found values
    
    print("\nTotal distinct k values found:", len(k_values))

solve()
```
