Maximum mean of B and C: 58.97674418604651. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the enumerated answers, we can observe that as A increases while maintaining the ratio A:B = 7:3, the mean of B and C approaches 59. The problem involves finding the maximum possible mean of B and C given certain constraints on their means with A.

The key is to recognize that:
1. From meanA and meanAB, we can derive the ratio A:B = 7:3
2. From meanA and meanAC, we can find C = A/7
3. The maximum mean occurs when we maximize totalB' + totalC' under the given constraints

The correct closed form solution should be based on these relationships and the limiting behavior we observe in the enumerated answers. The maximum mean approaches 59 as A increases.

Here's the corrected Lean answer:

<<<59>>> 

Explanation:
The maximum mean of B and C approaches 59 as A increases while maintaining the given constraints. This is derived from:
1. Solving the system of equations from the means to find the limiting ratio
2. Observing the pattern in the enumerated answers where the mean approaches 59
3. Recognizing that 59 is the theoretical maximum under the given conditions
The answer is simplified to this constant value since it represents the limiting case.
