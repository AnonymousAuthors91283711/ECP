[write_program]
This problem asks for the infimum of all positive real numbers x such that there exists y > 0 where x + y² = x*y. We'll approach this by:

1. Solving the equation x + y² = x*y for y in terms of x
2. Finding when real solutions exist (discriminant condition)
3. Determining the minimal x that satisfies these conditions

The program will:
1. Sample x values in small increments
2. For each x, check if the equation has a real solution y > 0
3. Track the smallest x found that satisfies the condition

```python
import math

def find_min_x():
    min_x = None
    # Search in small increments from 0 upwards
    step = 0.0001
    x = 0.0
    while x < 5.0:  # Reasonable upper bound
        x += step
        # Equation: x + y^2 = x*y => y^2 - x*y + x = 0
        # Discriminant must be non-negative: x^2 - 4x >= 0
        discriminant = x*x - 4*x
        if discriminant >= 0:
            # Solutions: y = [x ± sqrt(x^2 - 4x)]/2
            sqrt_discriminant = math.sqrt(discriminant)
            y1 = (x + sqrt_discriminant)/2
            y2 = (x - sqrt_discriminant)/2
            # Check if any solution is positive
            if y1 > 0 or y2 > 0:
                if min_x is None or x < min_x:
                    min_x = x
                    print(f"Found candidate x: {x:.6f}")
    # After search, output the minimal x found
    if min_x is not None:
        print(f"\nMinimal x found: {min_x:.6f}")

find_min_x()
```
