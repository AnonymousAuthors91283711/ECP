[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer s such that there exist integers a, b, c with a*b*c=60 and a+b+c=s. We'll enumerate possible factorizations of 60 and compute the sums to find the minimal s.

The approach:
1. Generate all ordered triples (a,b,c) where a*b*c=60
2. Calculate s = a+b+c for each valid triple
3. Track the smallest positive s found

We'll consider both positive and negative factors since the problem allows any integers. The program will systematically check all factor combinations.

```python
import math

def find_min_s():
    min_s = float('inf')
    target = 60
    
    # Generate all possible factors of 60 (positive and negative)
    factors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(target)) + 1):
        if target % i == 0:
            factors.add(i)
            factors.add(-i)
            factors.add(target // i)
            factors.add(-(target // i))
    factors = sorted(factors)
    
    # Check all ordered triples
    for a in factors:
        if target % a != 0:
            continue
        remaining = target // a
        for b in factors:
            if remaining % b != 0:
                continue
            c = remaining // b
            s = a + b + c
            if s > 0 and s < min_s:
                min_s = s
                print(f"Found new minimum s={s} with (a,b,c)=({a},{b},{c})")
    
    print(f"Final minimal s: {min_s}")

find_min_s()
```
