theorem omnimath3634 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ x, x ≠ 0 → (Nat.divisors x).card = (Nat.divisors (f x)).card) ∧
  (∀ x y, x ≠ 0 → y ≠ 0 → ¬(x ∣ y) → ¬(y ∣ x) →

Ground Truth Answer: fun x => if h : x = 0 then 0 else 
    let d := Nat.divisors x
    (minFac x) ^ (d.card - 1)
Proposed Answer: fun n => if n = 0 then 0 else ∏ p in n.primeFactors, p^(p-1)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a function f: ℕ → ℕ that satisfies two conditions:
   - Preserves the number of divisors for non-zero inputs
   - Strictly increases the gcd condition for coprime inputs

2. The ground truth answer:
   - For x=0: returns 0
   - For x≠0: takes the smallest prime factor of x and raises it to (number of divisors - 1) power

3. The proposed answer:
   - For n=0: returns 0
   - For n≠0: takes the product of all prime factors p of n raised to (p-1) power

Key differences:
- The ground truth uses only the minimal prime factor, while the proposed answer uses all prime factors
- The exponents are different: (d.card - 1) vs (p-1)
- The proposed answer would give different results for numbers with multiple distinct prime factors

Example test case: x=6
- Ground truth: minFac 6 = 2, divisors = {1,2,3,6} → 2^(4-1) = 8
- Proposed: primeFactors 6 = {2,3} → 2^(2-1)*3^(3-1) = 2*9 = 18

These give different results, so the answers are not equivalent.
