[write_program]
This problem asks for a permutation of numbers 1-9 that satisfies several conditions about sums and sums of squares of consecutive quadruples (with wrap-around). We'll write a Python program to enumerate all permutations of 1-9 and check these conditions.

The conditions are:
1. Sum of first 4 numbers = sum of next 4 numbers (positions 4-7)
2. Sum of next 4 numbers = sum of last 4 numbers (positions 7-9 + first number, wrapping around)
3. Same conditions as 1 and 2 but for sums of squares

```python
from itertools import permutations

def check_conditions(p):
    # Check sum conditions
    sum1 = sum(p[0:4])
    sum2 = sum(p[3:7])
    sum3 = sum(p[6:9] + p[0:1])
    if not (sum1 == sum2 == sum3):
        return False
    
    # Check sum of squares conditions
    sq1 = sum(x*x for x in p[0:4])
    sq2 = sum(x*x for x in p[3:7])
    sq3 = sum(x*x for x in p[6:9] + p[0:1])
    return sq1 == sq2 == sq3

# Since checking all 9! permutations is slow, we'll optimize by:
# 1. Only checking permutations where first element is 1 (since solution is circular)
# 2. Stopping after finding first solution (since problem suggests unique answer)
found = False
for perm in permutations(range(1, 10)):
    if perm[0] != 1:  # Reduce search space using symmetry
        continue
    if check_conditions(perm):
        print(perm)
        found = True
        break

if not found:
    print("No solution found")
```
