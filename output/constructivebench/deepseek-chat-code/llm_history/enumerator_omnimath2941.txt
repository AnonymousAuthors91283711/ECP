[write_program]
The problem asks to count the number of ordered triples (a, b, c) of positive integers satisfying:
1. 6*a*b = c²
2. a < b < c
3. c ≤ 35

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible triples meeting these conditions.

```python
def find_triples():
    count = 0
    max_c = 35
    for c in range(1, max_c + 1):
        c_squared = c * c
        if c_squared % 6 != 0:
            continue
        # Find all factor pairs (a,b) of c²/6 with a < b < c
        target = c_squared // 6
        # Iterate possible a values
        max_a = min(target, c - 2)  # a < b < c ⇒ a ≤ c-2
        for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
            if target % a != 0:
                continue
            b = target // a
            if a < b < c:
                print(f"Found triple: ({a}, {b}, {c})")
                count += 1
    print(f"Total number of triples: {count}")

find_triples()
```
