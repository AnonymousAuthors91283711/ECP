Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 4)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1), (2, 4)} ∪ {(a, b) | a = 0 ∧ b > 0}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all pairs (a,b) of natural numbers where 7^a - 3^b divides a^4 + b^2.

2. Ground truth gives only (2,4) as solution.

3. Proposed answer includes:
   - (1,1)
   - (2,4)
   - All pairs where a=0 and b>0

Testing the proposed additions:
- For (1,1): 7^1 - 3^1 = 4, and 1^4 + 1^2 = 2. But 4 does not divide 2. So (1,1) is invalid.
- For a=0 cases: 7^0 - 3^b = 1 - 3^b. For b>0, this is negative, while a^4 + b^2 is positive. A negative number can't divide a positive one unless we allow negative divisors, but even then the division wouldn't result in an integer.

The only valid solution is indeed (2,4):
- 7^2 - 3^4 = 49 - 81 = -32
- 2^4 + 4^2 = 16 + 16 = 32
- -32 divides 32 (result -1, which is integer)
