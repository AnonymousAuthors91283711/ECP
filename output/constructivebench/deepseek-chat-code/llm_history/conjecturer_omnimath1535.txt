Based on the enumerated answers, the series appears to be converging to approximately 7.0757. The proposed answer 63/8 (which equals 7.875) is too large compared to the convergence pattern. 

Looking at the partial sums:
- The series seems to be approaching a value around 7.0757
- The proposed 63/8 = 7.875 is significantly higher than the convergence value
- The error message suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable

The correct answer should be a real number close to the convergence value. Since the series involves prime factors and powers of 3, the exact value might be more complex than a simple fraction.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev omnimath1535_answer : ℝ := 7.0756860266>>>

Explanation:
1. The answer must be marked noncomputable due to Real number operations
2. The enumerated values show convergence to ~7.0756860266
3. This matches the last partial sum (n,k=20) which is likely very close to the limit
4. The original proposed 63/8 was incorrect based on the convergence pattern
