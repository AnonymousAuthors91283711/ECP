The problem is to find all positive real numbers x (with 3x ≠ 1 and 2x ≠ 1) that satisfy the logarithmic equation log₃ₓ(4) = log₂ₓ(8). We'll write a program to numerically search for solutions and identify patterns.

The approach involves:
1. Rewriting the equation using change of base formula
2. Searching for x values that satisfy the equation within a reasonable range
3. Checking for exact rational solutions

```python
import math

def check_solution(x):
    if x <= 0 or abs(3*x - 1) < 1e-10 or abs(2*x - 1) < 1e-10:
        return False
    lhs = math.log(4) / math.log(3*x)
    rhs = math.log(8) / math.log(2*x)
    return abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-8

def find_solutions():
    # Check simple fractions 1/n for n up to 20
    for n in range(1, 21):
        x = 1/n
        if check_solution(x):
            print(f"Found solution x = {x} (1/{n})")
    
    # Check more general fractions p/q with p,q small
    for q in range(1, 6):
        for p in range(1, 6):
            if math.gcd(p, q) == 1:
                x = p/q
                if x != 1/3 and x != 1/2 and check_solution(x):
                    print(f"Found solution x = {x} ({p}/{q})")
    
    # Search in decimal increments
    step = 0.01
    for i in range(1, 100):
        x = i * step
        if check_solution(x) and abs(x - round(x,2)) > 1e-4:
            print(f"Approximate solution x ≈ {x:.4f}")

Let me analyze this problem and the program:

1. Problem Analysis:
- We need to solve log₃ₓ(4) = log₂ₓ(8) for x > 0, with 3x ≠ 1 and 2x ≠ 1
- This can be rewritten using logarithm properties to: log4/log(3x) = log8/log(2x)
- Simplifying further gives: log4 * log(2x) = log8 * log(3x)
- The exact solution is x = 1/√6 ≈ 0.4082

2. Program Issues:
- The program checks fractions 1/n and p/q but misses the exact solution √6/6 (which is 1/√6)
- The decimal search uses too large steps (0.01) and might miss the solution
- The program outputs nothing because it doesn't find any exact fractions that satisfy the equation

3. Correct Approach:
- We should search around the theoretical solution (0.4082)
- Use a more precise search with smaller steps
- Include verification of the exact form (1/√6)

        x = i / 10000.0

Explanation:
The problem involves solving a logarithmic equation for a positive real x (with constraints 3x≠1 and 2x≠1). The task is to find the value(s) of x that satisfy the equation log₃ₓ(4) = log₂ₓ(8). 

Since no Python program was provided (empty program), we must reject this submission. We need to create a program that:
1. Solves the logarithmic equation symbolically or numerically
2. Respects the constraints (x>0, 3x≠1, 2x≠1)
3. Outputs the solution(s)

The equation can be transformed using logarithm properties to make it solvable. We'll use sympy for symbolic computation.

<<<False>>>

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the equation log(3x,4) = log(2x,8) with constraints x>0, 3x≠1, 2x≠1
x = sp.symbols('x', positive=True, real=True)
eq = sp.Eq(sp.log(4, 3*x), sp.log(8, 2*x))

# Solve the equation
solutions = sp.solve(eq, x)

# Filter solutions that violate constraints (though sympy should handle this with assumptions)
valid_solutions = [sol for sol in solutions if sol != 1/3 and sol != 1/2]

# Output the solution(s)
for sol in valid_solutions:
    print(sol)
```
