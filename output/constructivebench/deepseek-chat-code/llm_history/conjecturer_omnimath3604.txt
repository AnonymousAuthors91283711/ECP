open Nat Set

abbrev omnimath3604_answer : Set Nat := sorry
theorem omnimath3604 :
  {p : Nat | p.Prime ∧ ∃ k : ℤ, k^3 = p^2 - p + 1} = omnimath3604_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for primes p ≤ 1000 where p² - p + 1 is a perfect cube:
Found p = 19 with k = 7 (since 7³ = 343 = 19² - 19 + 1). Expected Answer Type: Set Nat
Based on the problem statement and the single example found (p=19), we can conjecture that the solution set contains only this prime. The condition p² - p + 1 being a perfect cube appears to be very restrictive, and no other primes below 1000 satisfy it.
