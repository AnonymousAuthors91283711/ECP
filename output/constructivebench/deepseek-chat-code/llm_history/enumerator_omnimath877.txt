This problem appears to be about finding the supremum of the set {x ∈ ℤ | |x * 2| ≤ 5}. We need to enumerate integer values of x where the absolute value of 2x is less than or equal to 5, then find the largest such x (the supremum).

The approach is:
1. Find all integers x where |2x| ≤ 5
2. The supremum will be the maximum value in this set

We'll implement this by:
1. Checking integers around 0 (since |2x| grows symmetrically)
2. Finding the bounds where |2x| ≤ 5
3. Outputting the maximum value found

```python
def main():
    Z = 2
    bound = 5
    max_x = None
    
    # Check positive x values first
    x = 0
    while True:
        if abs(x * Z) <= bound:
            max_x = x
            print(f"Found valid x: {x}")
            x += 1
        else:
            break
    
    # Check negative x values
    x = -1
    while True:
        if abs(x * Z) <= bound:
            print(f"Found valid x: {x}")
            x -= 1
        else:
            break
    
    # The supremum is the maximum valid x
    if max_x is not None:
        print(f"The supremum is: {max_x}")
    else:
        print("No valid x found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
