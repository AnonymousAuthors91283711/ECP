[write_program]
This problem involves finding integer coefficients a, b, c of a quadratic function f(x) = axÂ² + bx + c such that when evaluated at four specific inputs, the outputs match exactly four given values. We'll write a Python program to search for such coefficients.

The approach:
1. The problem gives us four (x, y) pairs where y = f(x)
2. We'll solve the system of equations to find a, b, c
3. Since we have more equations than unknowns, we'll check all combinations of 3 points to find consistent solutions
4. Then verify if the fourth point satisfies the found quadratic
