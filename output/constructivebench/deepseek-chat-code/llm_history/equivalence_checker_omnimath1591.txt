Ground Truth Answer: 577
Proposed Answer: 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^1
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem asks for the smallest number n in set S (numbers expressible as sum of three distinct powers of 2) such that there are exactly 99 smaller numbers in S.

2. The ground truth answer is 577, which is indeed equal to 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^1 (512 + 256 + 8 + 1 = 577).

3. The proposed answer expresses this exact same number in its exponential form.

4. Both answers represent the same numerical value, just in different forms (decimal vs exponential).

Therefore, the answers are equivalent.
