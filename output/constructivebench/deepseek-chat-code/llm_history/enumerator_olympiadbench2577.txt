[write_program]
This problem defines a recursive function f with specific rules for even and odd numbers. We need to compute f(50) based on these rules. The function is defined by:
- f(1) = 1
- For even n > 0: f(n) = f(n/2)
- For odd n > 1: f(n) = f(n-1) + 1

We'll implement this function in Python and compute f(50). The program will compute the function recursively with memoization for efficiency.

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    if n % 2 == 0:  # Even case
        return f(n // 2)
    else:  # Odd case
        return f(n - 1) + 1

# Compute and print f(50)
print(f(50))
```
