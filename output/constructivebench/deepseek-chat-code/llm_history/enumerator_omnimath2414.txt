[write_program]
This problem appears to be a simple multiplication problem where we need to compute the product of three given numbers (burgers=5, sides=3, drinks=12). The Python program should calculate and output this product.

```python
# Calculate and print the product of burgers (5), sides (3), and drinks (12)
burgers = 5
sides = 3
drinks = 12
print(burgers * sides * drinks)
```
