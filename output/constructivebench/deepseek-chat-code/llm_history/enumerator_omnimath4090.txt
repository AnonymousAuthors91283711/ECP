[write_program]
This problem appears to be a formalized mathematical statement about set properties and logical implications. While we can't directly translate the Lean proof into Python, we can create a program to enumerate small cases that might help understand the underlying combinatorial structure.

The problem involves:
1. A set of 6 candidates
2. Properties "appropriate", "perspective", and "universal" defined on subsets
3. Several logical conditions connecting these properties

We'll create a program to:
1. Enumerate all subsets of a smaller set (size 4 for efficiency)
2. Check properties that satisfy similar conditions
3. Output cases where the conditions hold

```python
from itertools import combinations

def main():
    # Using smaller universe size (4) for demonstration
    universe_size = 4
    candidates = set(range(universe_size))
    
    # Enumerate all possible subsets (powerset)
    all_subsets = []
    for k in range(universe_size + 1):
        all_subsets.extend(combinations(candidates, k))
    
    # Try to find properties that satisfy similar conditions
    for appropriate in all_subsets:
        appropriate_set = set(appropriate)
        # Check condition h3: perspective is subsets where adding one element makes appropriate
        perspective_subsets = []
        for subset in all_subsets:
            subset_set = set(subset)
            # Check if exists candidate not in subset where adding makes appropriate
            for candidate in candidates - subset_set:
                if subset_set | {candidate} in map(set, appropriate):
                    perspective_subsets.append(subset)
                    break
        
        # Check condition h4: universal candidates
        universal_candidates = []
        for candidate in candidates:
            universal = True
            for lineup in perspective_subsets:
                lineup_set = set(lineup)
                if candidate not in lineup_set and lineup_set <= (candidates - {candidate}):
                    if (lineup_set | {candidate}) not in map(set, appropriate):
                        universal = False
                        break
            if universal:
                universal_candidates.append(candidate)
        
        # Check condition h5: all candidates are universal
        if set(universal_candidates) == candidates:
            print(f"Found case where all candidates are universal")
            print(f"Appropriate subsets: {appropriate}")
            print(f"Perspective subsets: {perspective_subsets}")
            print("---")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note: This program explores small cases to help understand the problem structure. The actual problem involves 6 candidates, but enumerating all subsets for size 6 would be computationally expensive (2^64 subsets). The program demonstrates the approach with a smaller size (4) to maintain reasonable runtime while showing the pattern.
