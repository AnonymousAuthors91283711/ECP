[write_program]
This problem asks for natural numbers n > 0 where for every positive divisor k of n, the value f(k) divides f(n), with f(x) = x² + x + 1. We'll write a Python program to find such numbers by checking divisors of each n up to a reasonable limit.

The approach:
1. Define the function f(x) = x² + x + 1
2. For each n from 1 upwards, check all its positive divisors
3. Verify if f(k) divides f(n) for each divisor k of n
4. Print numbers that satisfy the condition

```python
def f(x):
    return x * x + x + 1

def get_divisors(n):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(n // i)
    return sorted(divisors)

max_n = 1000  # Reasonable search limit
results = []

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    divisors = get_divisors(n)
    valid = True
    for k in divisors:
        if k == 0:
            continue
        if f(n) % f(k) != 0:
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        results.append(n)
        print(n)  # Stream results immediately

# After enumeration, we can observe the pattern
print("Enumerated up to n =", max_n)
```
