From the enumerated sequences, we can observe that the problem is counting integer sequences of length 6 where each element a_i ≤ i and the sum is 6. The pattern suggests this is equivalent to counting weak compositions of 6 into 6 parts with constraints, which relates to binomial coefficients. The exact count matches the 11th Catalan number.
