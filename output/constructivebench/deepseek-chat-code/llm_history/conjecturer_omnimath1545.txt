Maximum sequence size for n=2: 2

Testing n = 3
Found valid sequence of size 3: ((0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2))
Maximum sequence size for n=3: 3

Testing n = 4
Found valid sequence of size 4: ((0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3))
Maximum sequence size for n=4: 4

Testing n = 5
Found valid sequence of size 5: ((0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4))
Maximum sequence size for n=5: 5. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
