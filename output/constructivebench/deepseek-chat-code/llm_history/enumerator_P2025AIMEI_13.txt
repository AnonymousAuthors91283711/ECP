This problem involves counting the maximum number of regions created by adding lines to an initial configuration. The initial setup has 2 lines creating 4 regions. Each new line added can intersect all previous lines, creating new regions. The formula given calculates the total regions after adding 25 lines to the initial 2.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Verify the given formula for small numbers of additional lines
2. Compute the final answer for 25 additional lines

```python
def count_regions(initial_lines, initial_regions, additional_lines):
    """Calculate total regions using the given formula"""
    expected_new_regions = (additional_lines * (additional_lines + 3)) // 2
    return initial_regions + expected_new_regions

# Test cases for small numbers of additional lines
print("Testing formula with small values:")
for n in range(1, 6):
    print(f"{n} additional lines -> {count_regions(2, 4, n)} regions")

# Final calculation for problem parameters
initial_lines = 2
initial_regions = 4
additional_lines = 25
result = count_regions(initial_lines, initial_regions, additional_lines)
print(f"\nFinal answer for {additional_lines} additional lines: {result}")
```
