Ground Truth Answer: 85
Proposed Answer: 1050
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest positive multiple of 5 (N % 5 = 0 ∧ N > 0) where P(N) < 321/400, and whose digit sum is 12.

2. The ground truth answer is 85:
   - 85 is a multiple of 5
   - Digit sum: 8 + 5 = 13 (but the problem requires sum=12, so this seems inconsistent)
   - Wait, this suggests the ground truth might have an error in digit sum

3. The proposed answer is 1050:
   - 1050 is a multiple of 5
   - Digit sum: 1 + 0 + 5 + 0 = 6 ≠ 12
   - Doesn't satisfy the digit sum condition

4. Both answers seem problematic regarding the digit sum condition. The ground truth answer's digit sum doesn't match (85 sums to 13), and the proposed answer's digit sum is wrong (1050 sums to 6).

However, the main issue is that the proposed answer (1050) is much larger than the ground truth (85), and neither satisfies the digit sum condition. The ground truth appears to be incorrect about its own digit sum condition.
