[write_program]
This problem involves a recursive sequence `a(n)` where each term is defined based on the largest prime ≤ the previous term. We need to find all perfect squares in this sequence. Here's a Python program to enumerate perfect squares in the sequence up to a reasonable limit:

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]:
        if n % p == 0:
            return n == p
    d = n - 1
    s = 0
    while d % 2 == 0:
        d //= 2
        s += 1
    for a in [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]:
        if a >= n:
            continue
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(s - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False
    return True

def largest_prime_leq(n):
    if n < 2:
        return 0
    while n >= 2:
        if is_prime(n):
            return n
        n -= 1
    return 0

def compute_sequence(limit):
    a = 2  # a(1) = 2
    i = 1
    squares = set()
    while a <= limit:
        # Check if current term is perfect square
        root = math.isqrt(a)
        if root * root == a:
            print(f"Found square: a({i}) = {a} = {root}^2")
            squares.add(a)
        # Compute next term
        l = largest_prime_leq(a)
        a += l
        i += 1
    return squares

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Searching for perfect squares in the sequence...")
    compute_sequence(10**6)
```

The program:
1. Implements Miller-Rabin primality test for efficiency
2. Computes the largest prime ≤ n by checking downwards from n
3. Generates the sequence a(n) recursively
4. Checks each term for being a perfect square
5. Prints squares as they're found up to a limit of 1,000,000

The sequence grows rapidly due to adding primes, so we limit the search to practical bounds. The program outputs any perfect squares found in the sequence immediately.
