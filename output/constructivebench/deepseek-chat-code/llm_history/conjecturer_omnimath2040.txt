    IsGreatest {s | ∃ a b : ℕ, P a b ∧ a + b = s} omnimath2040_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found valid pair: (1, 1) with sum 2
Found valid pair: (2, 8) with sum 10
Found valid pair: (3, 27) with sum 30
Found valid pair: (4, 64) with sum 68
Found valid pair: (8, 2) with sum 10
Found valid pair: (24, 54) with sum 78
Found valid pair: (27, 3) with sum 30
Found valid pair: (54, 24) with sum 78
Found valid pair: (64, 4) with sum 68

Maximum sum pairs:
(24, 54) with sum 78
(54, 24) with sum 78

Final answer: maximum sum is 78. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<78>>>
