noncomputable abbrev omnimath3452_answer : Fin 3 → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3452 :
  (∀ i : Fin 3, omnimath3452_answer i < omnimath3452_answer (i + 1)) ∧
  (∀ x : ℝ, (x = Real.sqrt 2011 ∨ x = 2011 ∨ x = 2011 ^ 2) → (∃! i : Fin 3, x = omnimath3452_answer i)) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found valid triplet: 44.844174649557324, 2011, 4044121
All required values are present exactly once
Final answer (in increasing order):
[44.844174649557324, 2011, 4044121]. Expected Answer Type: Fin 3 → ℝ
<<<fun i => match i with | 0 => Real.sqrt 2011 | 1 => 2011 | 2 => 2011^2>>>
