This problem involves summing over all permutations of 7 elements, calculating (7 minus the sum of cycle lengths) for each permutation, and finding the total sum. We'll write a Python program to compute this by enumerating all permutations of 7 elements, calculating the required value for each, and summing them up.

The key observations:
1. For a permutation σ, σ.cycleType.sum gives the number of elements (7 in this case)
2. So (7 - σ.cycleType.sum) will always be 0 for any permutation
3. Therefore, the sum should be 0 for any n, including n=7

However, to verify this, we'll write a program that:
1. Generates all permutations of 7 elements
2. For each permutation, calculates its cycle decomposition
3. Computes (7 - sum of cycle lengths)
4. Sums all these values

```python
from itertools import permutations

def cycle_lengths(perm):
    """Calculate lengths of cycles in a permutation"""
    n = len(perm)
    visited = [False] * n
    cycles = []
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycle_length = 0
            j = i
            while not visited[j]:
                visited[j] = True
                j = perm[j]
                cycle_length += 1
            cycles.append(cycle_length)
    return cycles

n = 7
total = 0

# For small n (like 7), we can enumerate all permutations
for perm in permutations(range(n)):
    cycles = cycle_lengths(perm)
    sum_cycles = sum(cycles)
    term = n - sum_cycles
    total += term

print(f"Total sum for n={n}: {total}")
```
