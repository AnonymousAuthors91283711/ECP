[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of three equations with three variables (x, y, z) involving logarithmic functions. We'll write a Python program to numerically search for real solutions by iterating through possible values and checking the equations.

The approach will be:
1. Define the equations as functions
2. Search through a reasonable range of values for x, y, z
3. Check if the equations hold within a small tolerance
4. Print any solutions found

```python
import math

def equation1(x, y):
    return abs(x + math.log10(x) - (y - 1))

def equation2(y, z):
    if y <= 1:  # log10(y-1) undefined when y-1 <= 0
        return float('inf')
    return abs(y + math.log10(y - 1) - (z - 1))

def equation3(z, x):
    if z <= 2:  # log10(z-2) undefined when z-2 <= 0
        return float('inf')
    return abs(z + math.log10(z - 2) - (x + 2))

tolerance = 1e-6

# Search ranges - adjust these if needed
x_start, x_end = 0.1, 10.0
y_start, y_end = 1.1, 10.0  # y must be >1 for log10(y-1)
z_start, z_end = 2.1, 10.0  # z must be >2 for log10(z-2)
step = 0.001

# Iterate through possible x values
x = x_start
while x <= x_end:
    # Solve first equation for y
    y = x + math.log10(x) + 1
    
    # Check if y is in valid range
    if y_start <= y <= y_end:
        # Solve second equation for z
        z = y + math.log10(y - 1) + 1
        
        # Check if z is in valid range
        if z_start <= z <= z_end:
            # Check third equation
            error = equation3(z, x)
            if error < tolerance:
                print(f"Possible solution found: x={x:.6f}, y={y:.6f}, z={z:.6f}")
    
    x += step
```
