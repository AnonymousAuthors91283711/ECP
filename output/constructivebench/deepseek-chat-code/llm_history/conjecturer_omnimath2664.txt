abbrev omnimath2664_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2664 :
  let pairs := [(1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1)]
  let values := pairs.map fun (x,y) => 2^(2 * y)
  values.sum = omnimath2664_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: For pair (1,6): 2^(2*6) = 4096
For pair (2,3): 2^(2*3) = 64
For pair (3,2): 2^(2*2) = 16
For pair (6,1): 2^(2*1) = 4
Total sum: 4180. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<4180>>>
