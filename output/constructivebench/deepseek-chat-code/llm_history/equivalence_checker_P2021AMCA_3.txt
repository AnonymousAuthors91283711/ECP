Ground Truth Answer: 14238
Proposed Answer: 15820 - 1582
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find natural numbers a and b such that:
   - a + b = 17402
   - 10 divides a (10 ∣ a)
   - b = a / 10
   - a - b equals the answer we're looking for

2. From b = a/10 and 10 ∣ a, we can express everything in terms of a:
   - a + (a/10) = 17402 => 11a/10 = 17402 => a = 17402 * 10 / 11 = 15820
   - Then b = 15820 / 10 = 1582
   - The answer should be a - b = 15820 - 1582 = 14238

3. The ground truth answer is 14238, which matches our calculation.

4. The proposed answer gives the expression "15820 - 1582" which evaluates to 14238, the correct answer.

The proposed answer is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth answer, just presented in a different form (as an expression rather than a simplified number).
