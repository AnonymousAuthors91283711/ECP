[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive rational number k that can be expressed as 3 - m/n where m and n are positive integers with m ≤ 2000. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal k by enumerating possible m and n values.

The approach is:
1. Iterate m from 1 to 2000
2. For each m, find the smallest possible k by maximizing m/n (which minimizes k)
3. Since k must be positive, we have 3 - m/n > 0 ⇒ n > m/3
4. The minimal k for each m occurs when n is the smallest integer greater than m/3

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def find_min_k():
    min_k = None
    for m in range(1, 2001):
        # Smallest n satisfying n > m/3 is ceil(m/3)
        n = (m + 2) // 3  # Equivalent to math.ceil(m/3)
        k = 3 - Fraction(m, n)
        if min_k is None or k < min_k:
            min_k = k
            print(f"New minimal k found: {k} with m={m}, n={n}")
    
    print(f"\nFinal minimal k: {min_k}")

find_min_k()
```
