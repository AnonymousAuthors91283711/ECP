Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 1), (3, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)}
Proposed Answer: {(m, n) | m = 1 ∧ n > 0} ∪ {(m, n) | n = 1 ∧ m > 0} ∪ {(k, (k^2 + 1)/(k - 1)) | k > 1}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but incomplete. It correctly identifies the infinite family of solutions where either m=1 or n=1 (which includes the ground truth cases (2,1), (3,1), (1,2), (1,3)), but the third part {(k, (k^2 + 1)/(k - 1)) | k > 1} is problematic because:
1. It's not guaranteed that (k^2 + 1)/(k - 1) will be integer for all k > 1
2. The ground truth answer only shows specific cases rather than this general form
3. The proposed answer might include more solutions than the ground truth shows, but we can't verify their correctness without more information
