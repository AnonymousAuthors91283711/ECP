This problem involves counting the number of solutions to two systems of equations with natural number variables, then computing their ratio. We'll enumerate all possible 4-tuples (qs0, qs1, qs2, qs3) that satisfy each condition.

For S: 2*qs0 + qs1 + qs2 + qs3 = 4
For T: Must satisfy S's equation AND qs0 + qs1 + qs2 + qs3 = 3

We'll enumerate all possible combinations where each qs_i is a natural number (including 0).

```python
from itertools import product

def count_S():
    count = 0
    for qs0, qs1, qs2, qs3 in product(range(3), repeat=4):  # qs0 up to 2 since 2*2=4
        if 2*qs0 + qs1 + qs2 + qs3 == 4:
            count += 1
    return count

def count_T():
    count = 0
    for qs0, qs1, qs2, qs3 in product(range(3), repeat=4):
        if (2*qs0 + qs1 + qs2 + qs3 == 4 and 
            qs0 + qs1 + qs2 + qs3 == 3):
            count += 1
    return count

S = count_S()
T = count_T()
print(f"Total solutions for S: {S}")
print(f"Solutions satisfying T: {T}")
print(f"Ratio T/S: {T}/{S} = {T/S}")
```
