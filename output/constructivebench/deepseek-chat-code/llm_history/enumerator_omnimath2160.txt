This problem involves finding the maximum number of voters (k) who all vote for the same candidate (s) in every single vote they cast, under the constraint that each voter's votes are distinct across different elections. 

We'll model this by:
1. Considering small values of N (number of candidates) and k
2. Checking if a valid voting configuration exists for each k
3. Finding the largest k where such a configuration exists

```python
def main():
    # Parameters: 2019 voters, N candidates
    voters = 2019
    max_N = 10  # We'll test up to 10 candidates
    
    max_k = 0
    
    for N in range(1, max_N + 1):
        # The maximum possible k is when each of the k voters votes for the same candidate s in all elections
        # Each voter must have distinct votes in different elections, but since they all vote for s,
        # the only way this works is if there's only 1 election (but problem implies multiple elections)
        # Wait, no - the condition is that for each voter, their votes across elections must be distinct
        
        # For k voters to all vote for s in all elections, their votes must be distinct per election
        # But since they're all voting for s, this is impossible unless there's only 1 election
        # But the problem implies multiple elections (since j₁ ≠ j₂)
        
        # Actually, the condition is that for each voter i, their votes across elections j are distinct
        # So if k voters all vote for s in all elections, their votes must be distinct per election
        # But they're all voting for s, so this can only happen if there's only 1 election
        
        # Therefore, the maximum k is 1 (only one voter can vote for s in all elections)
        # Because if two voters both vote for s in all elections, their votes would be identical
        
        # But let's verify this with small cases
        possible_k = 1  # At least 1 is always possible
        
        # Check if higher k is possible
        # For k voters to all vote for s in all elections:
        # Their votes must be distinct per election, but all equal to s
        # This is only possible if there's exactly 1 election (N=1)
        if N == 1:
            possible_k = voters
        else:
            possible_k = 1
        
        if possible_k > max_k:
            max_k = possible_k
        
        print(f"For N={N}, maximum k found: {possible_k}")
    
    print(f"Final maximum k across all N: {max_k}")

    main()
