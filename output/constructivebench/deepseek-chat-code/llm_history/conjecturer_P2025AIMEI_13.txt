Final answer for 25 additional lines: 354. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated answers and the pattern in the problem statement, I can see this is about counting regions formed by lines in a plane. The initial 2 lines create 4 regions. Each new line n adds (n+1) regions, leading to a quadratic formula.

The error in the current proposal is due to incorrect Lean syntax for multiple let bindings - they need to be separated by semicolons or line breaks. However, we can directly compute the closed form solution.

The general formula appears to be:
initial_regions + (n*(n+3))/2 where n is additional_lines
For n=25: 4 + (25*28)/2 = 354

Here's the fixed answer in Lean:
<<<4 + (25 * (25 + 3)) / 2>>>

Explanation:
1. Initial 2 lines create 4 regions
2. Each new line k adds (k+1) regions
3. Summing from k=1 to n gives n(n+3)/2 new regions
4. Total regions = initial + new = 4 + n(n+3)/2
5. For n=25, this evaluates to 354[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
