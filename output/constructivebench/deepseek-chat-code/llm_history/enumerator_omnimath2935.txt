[write_program]
This problem is about finding the smallest natural number n such that n/9 > 1/2. We'll write a Python program to enumerate natural numbers starting from 1 and check this condition. The first number satisfying the condition will be our answer.

```python
def find_min_n():
    # Check numbers starting from 1 upwards
    for n in range(1, 10):  # We know the answer must be <9 since 9/9=1>1/2
        if n / 9 > 1 / 2:
            print(f"Found candidate: {n}")
            print(f"Minimum n satisfying n/9 > 1/2 is: {n}")
            return
    print("No solution found in range")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_n()
```
