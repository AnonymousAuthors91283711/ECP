The problem appears to be about calculating the difference in reach probabilities between two states (m=20 and m=15) in some mathematical system. Since we don't have the exact definition of `reach_prob`, we'll need to make reasonable assumptions to create an enumerator.

Let's assume this is about a random walk or Markov chain problem where `reach_prob m` represents the probability of reaching some target state from state m. We'll model a simple symmetric random walk where at each step, you move +1 or -1 with equal probability, and we want the probability of reaching state 0 before state N (for some large N).

Here's a Python program that enumerates reach probabilities for small values of m and calculates their differences:

```python
def calculate_reach_probabilities(max_m=20, N=100):
    """
    Calculate reach probabilities for a symmetric random walk from state m to state 0
    before reaching state N, for m from 1 to max_m.
    Then compute differences between probabilities.
    """
    # Probability of reaching 0 before N starting from m
    prob = [0.0] * (N + 1)
    prob[0] = 1.0
    prob[N] = 0.0
    
    # Solve the system of equations: prob[m] = 0.5*prob[m-1] + 0.5*prob[m+1]
    # Using the known solution: prob[m] = 1 - m/N
    for m in range(1, N):
        prob[m] = 1 - m / N
    
    # Print probabilities for m up to max_m
    print("Reach probabilities:")
    for m in range(1, max_m + 1):
        print(f"P({m}) = {prob[m]:.6f}")
    
    # Calculate and print differences
    print("\nDifferences:")
    for m1 in range(1, max_m):
        m2 = m1 + 1
        diff = prob[m1] - prob[m2]
        print(f"P({m1}) - P({m2}) = {diff:.6f}")
    
    # Specific difference asked in problem
    diff_20_15 = prob[20] - prob[15]
    print(f"\nP(20) - P(15) = {diff_20_15:.6f}")

# Run with default parameters
calculate_reach_probabilities()
```

Note: This is just one possible interpretation of the problem. The actual `reach_prob` function might be defined differently in the original problem. The program above models a simple symmetric random walk as an example, but the true solution would depend on the exact definition of `reach_prob` in the original problem.
