[write_program]
This problem involves computing the determinant of a matrix where each entry counts the number of non-negative integer solutions (p₁, p₂) to p₁*i + p₂*j = n for i,j ∈ {1,...,n}. We'll write a Python program to enumerate these counts and compute the determinant for small n values to identify patterns.

The approach:
1. For each n from 1 upwards, construct the n×n matrix
2. Each matrix entry (i,j) counts solutions to p₁*i + p₂*j = n
3. Compute the determinant of this matrix
4. Output results for small n values to observe patterns

```python
import math
from itertools import product
from sympy import Matrix

def count_solutions(a, b, n):
    """Count non-negative integer solutions to a*x + b*y = n"""
    count = 0
    for x in range(0, n//a + 1):
        remainder = n - a*x
        if remainder >= 0 and remainder % b == 0:
            count += 1
    return count

def compute_matrix(n):
    """Construct the n×n matrix for given n"""
    return Matrix([
        [count_solutions(i+1, j+1, n) 
         for j in range(n)]
        for i in range(n)
    ])

def main():
    max_n = 8  # Reasonable upper bound for demonstration
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        mat = compute_matrix(n)
        det = mat.det()
        print(f"n={n}: det = {det}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
