theorem omnimath1859
(x y z : ℝ)
(h1 : x + 2 * y - 3 * z = 7)
(h2 : 2 * x - y + 2 * z = 6)
: 8 * x + y = omnimath1859_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: For z = -2: 8x + y = 31.999999999999993
For z = 0: 8x + y = 32.0
For z = 1: 8x + y = 31.999999999999996
For z = 3: 8x + y = 31.999999999999993
For z = 5: 8x + y = 32.00000000000001. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
