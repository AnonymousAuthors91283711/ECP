[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of permutations of 7 elements where each element (except the last) is at most one greater than its successor. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all valid permutations of small sizes first to identify a pattern, then compute the answer for size 7.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def count_valid_permutations(n):
    count = 0
    for perm in permutations(range(1, n+1)):
        valid = True
        for i in range(n-1):
            if perm[i] > perm[i+1] + 1:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1
    return count

# Print counts for small n values to identify pattern
for n in range(1, 6):
    print(f"n={n}: {count_valid_permutations(n)}")

# Compute answer for n=7 (this will take longer)
n = 7
result = count_valid_permutations(n)
print(f"n={n}: {result}")
```

The program first enumerates valid permutations for small sizes (1-5) to help identify a pattern, then computes the answer for size 7. The output shows the counts for each size, with the final answer being the count for n=7. Note that for n=7, the computation may take significant time due to the factorial growth of permutations.
