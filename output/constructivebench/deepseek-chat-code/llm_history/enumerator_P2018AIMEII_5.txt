[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of complex equations to find a real-valued answer. We'll write a Python program to verify the relationships and compute the required expression. The approach involves:
1. Solving the system of equations for x, y, z
2. Computing the target expression |x|² + |y|² + |z|²
3. Verifying it equals 74

We'll use exact calculations where possible, but will need to handle complex numbers carefully.

```python
import cmath
import math

# Given equations:
# xy = -80 - 320i
# yz = 60
# zx = -96 + 24i

# Compute y from yz and xy/xz = y/z
xy = complex(-80, -320)
yz = complex(60, 0)
zx = complex(-96, 24)

# Calculate x = (xy * zx) / (yz)
x_squared = (xy * zx) / yz
x = cmath.sqrt(x_squared)
# Get both roots
x1 = x
x2 = -x

# Compute z from zx
z1 = zx / x1
z2 = zx / x2

# Compute y from yz
y1 = yz / z1
y2 = yz / z2

# Function to compute |x|² + |y|² + |z|²
def compute_norm(x, y, z):
    return abs(x)**2 + abs(y)**2 + abs(z)**2

# Check both roots
result1 = compute_norm(x1, y1, z1)
result2 = compute_norm(x2, y2, z2)

# Print results with 10 decimal places to verify exactness
print(f"Solution 1: {result1:.10f}")
print(f"Solution 2: {result2:.10f}")

# Verify if either solution equals 74 exactly
tol = 1e-10
if math.isclose(result1, 74, rel_tol=tol, abs_tol=tol):
    print("Found solution equal to 74")
if math.isclose(result2, 74, rel_tol=tol, abs_tol=tol):
    print("Found solution equal to 74")
```
