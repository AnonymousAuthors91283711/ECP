[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest digit d (0 â‰¤ d < 10) that does not appear in any perfect square between 100 and 400 (inclusive). We'll write a Python program to check each digit from 0 to 9 and find which one is missing from all squares in this range.

```python
def main():
    # Check all perfect squares between 100 and 400 (10^2 to 20^2)
    squares = [n*n for n in range(10, 21)]
    
    # Track which digits appear in any square
    present_digits = set()
    
    for square in squares:
        present_digits.update(str(square))
    
    # Check which digits 0-9 are missing
    all_digits = set('0123456789')
    missing_digits = all_digits - present_digits
    
    print("Digits present in squares:", sorted(present_digits))
    print("Missing digits:", sorted(missing_digits))
    
    if missing_digits:
        print("The smallest missing digit is:", min(missing_digits))
    else:
        print("All digits 0-9 appear in squares between 100 and 400")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
