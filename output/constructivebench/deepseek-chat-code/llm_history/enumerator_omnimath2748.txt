[write_program]
This appears to be a simple arithmetic problem where we need to compute 2*0 + 2*4. The answer should be straightforward, but since the problem mentions "enumerate possible answers" and "conjecturing", I'll write a Python program that demonstrates the computation process.

The program will:
1. Show the step-by-step computation
2. Print intermediate results
3. Output the final answer

```python
# Demonstrating the computation of 2*0 + 2*4
print("Computing 2 * 0 + 2 * 4 step by step:")
print(f"2 * 0 = {2 * 0}")
print(f"2 * 4 = {2 * 4}")
print(f"Sum: {2 * 0} + {2 * 4} = {2 * 0 + 2 * 4}")
```
