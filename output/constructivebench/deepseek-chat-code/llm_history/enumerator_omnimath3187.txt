[write_program]
The problem is to find a natural number `x` such that `3 * x - 5 = 16`. This is a simple linear equation that can be solved algebraically, but we'll write a Python program to enumerate possible solutions by checking natural numbers sequentially.

The program will iterate through natural numbers starting from 1, check if they satisfy the equation, and print any valid solutions found. Since this is a linear equation, there will be exactly one solution, which we'll find quickly.

```python
def find_solution():
    x = 1
    while True:
        if 3 * x - 5 == 16:
            print(f"Solution found: x = {x}")
            break
        x += 1

find_solution()
```
