This problem involves solving a logarithmic equation for x. We'll write a Python program to numerically approximate the solution by testing values around a reasonable range. The equation simplifies to finding when the left and right sides are equal.

```python
import math

def f(x):
    left = math.log(2**(x-1) + 3**(x+1)) / math.log(2)
    right = 2 * x - math.log(3**x) / math.log(2)
    return left - right  # We want to find where this equals 0

# Binary search to find the root
def find_root():
    low, high = -10.0, 10.0
    tolerance = 1e-10
    max_iter = 100
    
    for _ in range(max_iter):
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        val = f(mid)
        if abs(val) < tolerance:
            return mid
        if val > 0:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    return (low + high) / 2

solution = find_root()
print(f"Approximate solution: x â‰ˆ {solution}")
print(f"Verification: f({solution}) = {f(solution)}")
```
