Ground Truth Answer: 630
Proposed Answer: Nat.choose 9 4 * Nat.choose 4 1 * Nat.choose 3 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting the number of injective functions from Fin 4 to Fin 9 (since q i ≠ q j for i ≠ j) with additional ordering constraints:
   - q1 < q0
   - q1 < q2
   - q3 < q2

2. The ground truth answer is 630.

3. The proposed answer breaks it down as:
   - Nat.choose 9 4 = 126 (selecting 4 distinct numbers from 9)
   - Nat.choose 4 1 = 4 (selecting which number will be q2, the largest)
   - Nat.choose 3 1 = 3 (selecting which remaining number will be q1, the smallest)
   - 126 × 4 × 3 = 1512 ≠ 630

The proposed answer is incorrect in its counting approach. The correct counting should be:
- Choose 4 distinct numbers from 9: C(9,4) = 126
- From these 4 numbers, the middle two must satisfy q1 < q0 and q1 < q2 and q3 < q2
- The number of valid orderings is 5 (not 4×3=12)
- 126 × 5 = 630
