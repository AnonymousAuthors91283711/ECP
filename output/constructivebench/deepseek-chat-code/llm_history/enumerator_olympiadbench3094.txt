[write_program]
This problem involves calculating a sum of a sequence with alternating terms based on modulo 3 conditions, up to a floor value determined by a constant K. We'll write a Python program to compute this sum exactly and efficiently.

Key observations:
1. The sequence alternates between positive and negative terms every 3 steps
2. Each term is a linear function of n
3. We need to compute the sum up to floor(K) where K = (72√2/12)^2 = (6√2)^2 = 72

```python
import math

def compute_sum():
    T = 72 * math.sqrt(2)
    K = (T / 12) ** 2
    max_n = int(math.floor(K))
    
    total = 0.0
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        term = 0.5 + 0.5 * (n - 1)
        if n % 3 == 0:
            term *= -1
        total += term
    
    print(f"Sum for n up to {max_n}: {total}")

compute_sum()
```
