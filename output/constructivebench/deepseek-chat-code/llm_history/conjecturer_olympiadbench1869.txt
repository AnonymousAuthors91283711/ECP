: {f : ℕ → ℕ | ∀ m n : ℕ, m > 0 → n > 0 → f m + f n - m * n ≠ 0 ∧ (f m + f n - m * n) ∣ (m * f m + n * f n)} = olympiadbench1869_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing linear functions f(n) = a*n + b:
Found candidate: f(n) = 0n + 0
Note: The constant function f(n) = n^2 is another potential candidate. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ → ℕ)
