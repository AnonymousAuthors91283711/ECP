Ground Truth Answer: { (m, n) : ℕ × ℕ | 1 < m ∧ 1 < n ∧ 3 ∣ m * n }
Proposed Answer: {p : ℕ × ℕ | p.1 % 2 = 0 ∧ p.2 % 2 = 0 ∧ p.1 ≥ 2 ∧ p.2 ≥ 2}
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer:

1. Ground truth requires both m,n > 1 and 3 divides m*n
2. Proposed answer requires both m,n even and ≥ 2

These are not equivalent because:
- There are pairs where 3 divides m*n but not both even (e.g., (3,4))
- There are pairs where both are even but 3 doesn't divide m*n (e.g., (2,4))

The proposed answer is incorrect as it captures a different set of solutions. The condition about even numbers is not equivalent to divisibility by 3.
