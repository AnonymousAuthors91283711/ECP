Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ[X])
From the enumerated answers, we can observe that all valid polynomials have coefficients in {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}. The condition requires that if P evaluates to integers at s and t, then it must evaluate to an integer at s*t. The simplest solution is all constant polynomials (degree 0) and linear polynomials (degree 1) with coefficients in {-1,0,1}, but the enumeration shows some degree 2 polynomials with coefficients in {-2,2} are also valid. However, the most general pattern appears to be polynomials with all coefficients in {-1,0,1}.
