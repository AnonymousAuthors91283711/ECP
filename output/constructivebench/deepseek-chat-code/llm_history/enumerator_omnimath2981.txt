This problem is asking to find the unique positive integer m such that 2.1 * m = 52.8. We can solve this by converting the decimals to fractions and finding the exact solution.

The Python program will:
1. Convert 2.1 and 52.8 to exact fractions (21/10 and 528/10)
2. Solve for m = (528/10) / (21/10) = 528/21
3. Simplify the fraction and check if it's an integer
4. Output the solution if it exists

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve():
    # Convert decimals to exact fractions
    left = Fraction(21, 10)  # 2.1 = 21/10
    right = Fraction(528, 10)  # 52.8 = 528/10
    
    # Solve for m: m = right / left
    m = right / left
    
    # Check if m is an integer
    if m.denominator == 1:
        print(f"Solution found: m = {m.numerator}")
    else:
        print("No integer solution exists")

solve()
```
