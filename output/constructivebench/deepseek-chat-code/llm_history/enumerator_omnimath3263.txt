[write_program]
This problem appears to be a simple arithmetic calculation (2.4 * 10^8 * 2). Since it's a straightforward computation, we'll write a Python program that calculates and prints the exact value. The result should be 4.8 * 10^8, but we'll let the program compute it to demonstrate the process.

```python
# Calculate 2.4 * 10^8 * 2 and print the result
result = 2.4 * (10 ** 8) * 2
print(result)
```
