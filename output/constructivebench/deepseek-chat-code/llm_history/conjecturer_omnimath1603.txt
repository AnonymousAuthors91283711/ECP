Computing (x⁶+y⁶)/(x⁵+y⁵) for valid pairs:. Expected Answer Type: Set ℂ
From the problem and enumerated solutions, we observe that the ratio (x⁶+y⁶)/(x⁵+y⁵) consistently evaluates to 4/3 for valid (x,y) pairs. This suggests the answer set is a singleton containing 4/3.

Computing (x⁶+y⁶)/(x⁵+y⁵) for valid pairs:. Expected Answer Type: Set ℂ
Based on the error message and the problem context, the issue is that we need to properly define a set in Lean. The proposed answer `{4/3 : ℂ}` is missing the proper set constructor syntax. In Lean, we should use `{z : ℂ | z = 4/3}` to define a singleton set.

Looking at the problem:
1. We have complex numbers x,y satisfying two ratio conditions
2. The goal is to find all possible values of (x⁶+y⁶)/(x⁵+y⁵)
3. From the enumerated answers, it appears the only value is 4/3

The solution should be the set containing just the complex number 4/3. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<{z : ℂ | z = 4 / 3}>>>

Explanation:
- The problem involves complex numbers x,y satisfying two ratio conditions
- The final ratio (x⁶+y⁶)/(x⁵+y⁵) evaluates to 4/3 for all valid pairs
- We represent this as a set containing exactly the complex number 4/3
- The Lean syntax `{z : ℂ | z = 4 / 3}` properly defines this singleton set
