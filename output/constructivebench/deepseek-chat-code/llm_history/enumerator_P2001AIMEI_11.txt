[write_program]
This problem involves finding the smallest positive integer N such that there exists a 5-tuple of numbers x_i (i=0..4) where each x_i is in the range [1+(i-1)*N, i*N], and they satisfy a specific cyclic relationship through a transformation y. We'll write a Python program to search for the minimal N by checking possible values in order.

The approach:
1. Iterate N from 1 upwards
2. For each N, generate all possible x_i values within their respective ranges
3. Check if the cyclic conditions are satisfied
4. The first N that satisfies all conditions is our answer

```python
def solve():
    N = 1
    while True:
        # Generate ranges for each x_i
        ranges = [
            range(1 + (i-1)*N, i*N + 1) if (i-1)*N < i*N else [1 + (i-1)*N]
            for i in range(5)
        ]
        
        # We'll try to find x values that satisfy the conditions
        # To optimize, we'll iterate through possible x0 and x1 first
        for x0 in ranges[0]:
            y1 = ((x0 - 1) % N) * 5 + 1
            if y1 not in ranges[1]:
                continue
            x1 = y1
            
            y0 = ((x1 - 1) % N) * 5 + 0
            if y0 != x0:
                continue
                
            # Now check x2, x3, x4
            for x2 in ranges[2]:
                y3 = ((x2 - 1) % N) * 5 + 3
                if y3 not in ranges[3]:
                    continue
                x3 = y3
                
                y4 = ((x3 - 1) % N) * 5 + 4
                if y4 not in ranges[4]:
                    continue
                x4 = y4
                
                y2 = ((x4 - 1) % N) * 5 + 2
                if y2 == x2:
                    print(f"Found solution with N = {N}")
                    print(f"x values: {[x0, x1, x2, x3, x4]}")
                    return N
        
        N += 1
        if N > 1000:  # Safety limit
            print("No solution found within N=1000")
            return

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solution = solve()
    print(f"Minimal N is: {solution}")
```
