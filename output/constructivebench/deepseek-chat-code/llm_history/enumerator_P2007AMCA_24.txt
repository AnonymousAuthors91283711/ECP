[write_program]
This problem appears to be about summing a function F(n) over integers n from 2 to 2007. Since we don't know what F(n) is, we'll need to make reasonable assumptions. A common competition problem might involve floor functions or fractional parts. Let's assume F(n) = floor(n/2) - floor(n/3) as a sample function that creates an interesting pattern.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Define this sample F(n) function
2. Calculate the sum from n=2 to 2007
3. Print partial sums periodically to show progress
4. Output the final sum

```python
def F(n):
    return (n // 2) - (n // 3)

total = 0
for n in range(2, 2008):
    total += F(n)
    # Print progress every 200 numbers
    if n % 200 == 0 or n == 2007:
        print(f"Sum up to n={n}: {total}")

print(f"Final sum from 2 to 2007: {total}")
```
