This problem involves finding three distinct integers a, b, c that satisfy several conditions:
1. They form an arithmetic sequence (b-a = c-b)
2. Their product is 17955
3. There exists an integer r relating the expressions (3b+c) and (3a+b), and similarly for (3c+a) and (3b+c)
4. The sum a+b+c is the answer we seek

We'll write a Python program to find all possible (a,b,c) triples that satisfy these conditions, then output their sums.

```python
def factor_pairs(n):
    """Generate all factor pairs (d, n//d) where d <= n//d"""
    factors = set()
    for d in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % d == 0:
            factors.add((d, n // d))
    return factors

def find_triples():
    target = 17955
    # Since a,b,c form arithmetic sequence, let b = a + d, c = a + 2d
    # Then a*b*c = a(a+d)(a+2d) = 17955
    # We'll search for possible d values where the product condition holds
    
    # The maximum possible |d| is when a is near cube root of 17955
    max_d = int((abs(target)*2)**(1/3)) + 2
    
    solutions = []
    for d in range(1, max_d + 1):
        # Try both positive and negative d
        for sign in [1, -1]:
            current_d = d * sign
            # We need to find integer a such that a(a+d)(a+2d) = 17955
            # Let's find factors of 17955 first
            for p, q in factor_pairs(target):
                # Check if p, q can be a and a+2d
                if (q - p) % 2 == 0:
                    possible_d = (q - p) // 2
                    if possible_d == current_d:
                        a = p
                        b = a + current_d
                        c = a + 2*current_d
                        if a*b*c == target and a != b and b != c and a != c:
                            # Check the ratio conditions
                            try:
                                r1 = (3*b + c) / (3*a + b)
                                r2 = (3*c + a) / (3*b + c)
                                if abs(r1 - r2) < 1e-9 and r1 == int(r1):
                                    solutions.append((a, b, c))
                            except ZeroDivisionError:
                                continue
    return solutions

# Find and print all valid triples
solutions = find_triples()
for a, b, c in solutions:
    print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, sum={a+b+c}")
    # Also print the negative version since product is odd
    print(f"Negative solution: a={-c}, b={-b}, c={-a}, sum={-a-b-c}")
```
[refine_program]
Let me analyze the problem and the program:

1. Problem Analysis:
- We need to find distinct integers a, b, c where:
  - They form an arithmetic sequence (b-a = c-b)
  - Their product is 17955
  - There exists an integer r satisfying two ratio conditions
  - The sum a+b+c is the answer we want

2. Program Issues:
- The current approach tries to find factor pairs of 17955 and match them to arithmetic sequences, but this is too restrictive
- The ratio conditions are checked using floating-point division, which is unreliable for exact integer problems
- The negative version printing assumes symmetry that might not hold for the ratio conditions
- The program outputs nothing because the factor pair approach doesn't find valid sequences satisfying all conditions

3. Better Approach:
- Since a,b,c form an arithmetic sequence, express them as (b-d, b, b+d)
- The product becomes b(b²-d²) = 17955
- We can iterate through possible b values (divisors of 17955) and check conditions
- The ratio conditions can be checked exactly using integer arithmetic

<<<False>>>

Here's the corrected program:

```python
def find_solutions():
    target = 17955
    solutions = []
    
    # Find all divisors of 17955
    divisors = set()
    for d in range(1, int(abs(target)**0.5) + 1):
        if target % d == 0:
            divisors.add(d)
            divisors.add(target // d)
    divisors.add(-1)  # Include negative divisors
    divisors.add(-target)
    
    # Check each possible middle term b
    for b in divisors:
        # We have b(b² - d²) = 17955
        # So b must divide 17955 (which it does since b is a divisor)
        # We need to find integer d such that d² = b² - (17955//b)
        remainder = target // b
        if b == 0:
            continue
        discriminant = b*b - remainder
        if discriminant < 0:
            continue  # d would be non-real
        
        d = int(round(discriminant**0.5))
        if d*d != discriminant:
            continue  # d must be perfect square
        
        # Check both positive and negative d
        for current_d

Explanation:
The problem is to find integers a, b, c that satisfy several conditions, including being distinct, having product 17955, forming an arithmetic sequence (b-a = c-b), and satisfying two ratio conditions. The sum a+b+c is the answer we need to find.

Since no program was provided, we need to create one that:
1. Finds all triples (a,b,c) where b-a = c-b (arithmetic sequence)
2. Checks that a*b*c = 17955
3. Verifies the ratio conditions
4. Outputs valid sums a+b+c

The arithmetic sequence condition implies b = a+d and c = a+2d for some integer d ≠ 0. We can iterate through possible values of d and solve for a.

Here's a corrected Python program that solves the problem:

```python
def factor_pairs(n):
    pairs = set()
    for i in range(1, int(abs(n)**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            pairs.add((i, n//i))
            pairs.add((-i, -n//i))
    return pairs

def solve():
    target = 17955
    # Since b = a + d, c = a + 2d, and a*b*c = a(a+d)(a+2d) = 17955
    # We can iterate through possible d values
    max_d = 50  # Reasonable bound based on target magnitude
    
    for d in range(1, max_d + 1):
        # Positive d case
        # Equation becomes a(a+d)(a+2d) = 17955
        # We can find a by checking factors
        for (a, rest) in factor_pairs(target):
            if rest % (a + d) == 0 and (rest // (a + d)) == a + 2*d:
                b, c = a + d, a + 2*d
                # Check ratio conditions
                if (3*b + c) % (3*a + b) == 0:
                    r = (3*b + c) // (3*a + b)
                    if (3*c + a) == r * (3*b + c):
                        print(a + b + c)
        
        # Negative d case
        d_neg
