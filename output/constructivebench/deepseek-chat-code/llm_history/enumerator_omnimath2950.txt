[write_program]
The problem involves finding integers r and b such that r = b + 6 and r/b = 5/3. We need to find r + b. This is a system of equations that can be solved algebraically, but we'll write a Python program to enumerate possible solutions by checking small integer values of b.

The approach is:
1. Iterate through possible values of b starting from 1
2. Calculate r = b + 6 for each b
3. Check if r/b equals 5/3 (using cross-multiplication to avoid floating point)
4. When found, print r + b and stop

```python
def find_rb_sum():
    for b in range(1, 100):  # Reasonable upper bound
        r = b + 6
        if 3 * r == 5 * b:  # Cross-multiply to check r/b = 5/3
            print(f"Found solution: r={r}, b={b}")
            print(f"r + b = {r + b}")
            return
    print("No solution found in range")

find_rb_sum()
```
