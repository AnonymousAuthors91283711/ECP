Ground Truth Answer: {s : ℤ | s ≥ 4 ∧ ¬Prime s}
Proposed Answer: {s : ℤ | s ≥ 4 ∧ s ≠ 5 ∧ s ≠ 7 ∧ s ≠ 11 ∧ s ≠ 13 ∧ s ≠ 17 ∧ s ≠ 19 ∧ s ≠ 23 ∧ s ≠ 29}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but not exactly equivalent to the ground truth. The ground truth answer includes all composite numbers ≥4 (i.e., non-prime numbers), while the proposed answer explicitly lists exceptions (prime numbers) up to 29. The proposed answer would miss any prime numbers greater than 29, making it incomplete compared to the ground truth answer which covers all non-prime numbers ≥4.
