Looking at the enumerated answers, we can see the series converges to approximately 2/3 (0.666...). The series is defined as p(n) = (1/2)^(2n-1). 

The error in the Lean code is due to missing parentheses around the sum expression. The correct form should have the sum properly delimited. The series is a geometric series with first term a = (1/2)^(2*1-1) = 1/2 and ratio r = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

The sum of an infinite geometric series is a/(1-r), which gives (1/2)/(1-1/4) = (1/2)/(3/4) = 2/3.
