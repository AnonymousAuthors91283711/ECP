This problem is about finding a minimal sum of exponents (ns.sum) for a signed sum of powers of 2 that equals 2008. The solution involves finding binary representations with possible negative coefficients (-1 or 1).

We'll approach this by:
1. Finding the standard binary representation of 2008
2. Exploring alternative representations where we can replace higher powers with negative coefficients and adjust lower terms
3. Systematically checking combinations to find the minimal sum of exponents

```python
def find_minimal_exponents_sum():
    target = 2008
    # Start with standard binary representation
    binary = []
    n = target
    while n > 0:
        power = n.bit_length() - 1
        binary.append(power)
        n -= 1 << power
    
    min_sum = sum(binary)
    print(f"Standard binary: exponents {binary}, sum={min_sum}")
    
    # We'll try to find better representations by replacing 2^k with -2^k + 2^{k+1}
    # This is equivalent to replacing one exponent k with two exponents (k+1, k)
    # We need to explore all possible such replacements that could reduce the total sum
    
    from itertools import combinations
    
    # We'll limit our search to reasonable exponent ranges
    max_power = 20
    candidates = []
    
    # Generate all possible combinations of exponents to flip
    for flip_count in range(1, 5):  # Try flipping up to 4 times
        for flip_positions in combinations(range(len(binary)), flip_count):
            new_exponents = binary.copy()
            # For each position to flip, replace k with (k+1, k)
            for pos in sorted(flip_positions, reverse=True):
                k = new_exponents.pop(pos)
                new_exponents.insert(pos, k)
                new_exponents.insert(pos, k+1)
            
            # Check if this gives us the correct sum (2008)
            total = 0
            for exp in new_exponents:
                total += (1 << exp)
            
            # We need to account for possible negative coefficients
            # The actual sum would be calculated with alternating signs
            # This is more complex, so we'll just print candidates for manual verification
            if len(new_exponents) <= 15:  # Prevent too large outputs
                current_sum = sum(new_exponents)
                if current_sum < min_sum:
                    min_sum = current_sum
                    print(f"New candidate: exponents {sorted(new_exponents, reverse=True)}, sum={current_sum}")
    
    print(f"Minimal sum found: {min_sum}")

find_minimal_exponents_sum()
```
