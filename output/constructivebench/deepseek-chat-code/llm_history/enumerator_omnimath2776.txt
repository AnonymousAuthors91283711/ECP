This problem asks to find natural numbers x and y such that 2^11 * 6^5 = 4^x * 3^y, with x > 0 and y > 0, and then determine the minimal possible value of x + y. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible (x,y) pairs that satisfy the equation and find the minimal sum.

First, let's simplify the equation:
2^11 * 6^5 = 2^11 * (2*3)^5 = 2^11 * 2^5 * 3^5 = 2^16 * 3^5
4^x * 3^y = (2^2)^x * 3^y = 2^(2x) * 3^y

So the equation becomes:
2^16 * 3^5 = 2^(2x) * 3^y

This gives us two equations:
1. 2x = 16 â‡’ x = 8
2. y = 5

Thus, the only solution is (x,y) = (8,5) with sum 13.

Here's the Python program that verifies this:

```python
def main():
    # Given equation: 2^11 * 6^5 = 4^x * 3^y
    left = (2**11) * (6**5)
    
    # We'll search x and y up to 20 (arbitrary upper bound)
    min_sum = float('inf')
    best_pair = None
    
    for x in range(1, 21):
        for y in range(1, 21):
            right = (4**x) * (3**y)
            if left == right:
                print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}, sum={x+y}")
                if x + y < min_sum:
                    min_sum = x + y
                    best_pair = (x, y)
    
    if best_pair:
        print(f"Minimal sum is {min_sum} achieved at x={best_pair[0]}, y={best_pair[1]}")
    else:
        print("No solution found in the search range")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program will output:
Found solution: x=8, y=5, sum=13
Minimal sum is 13 achieved at x=8, y=5

This confirms our algebraic solution is correct and that 13 is indeed the minimal sum.
