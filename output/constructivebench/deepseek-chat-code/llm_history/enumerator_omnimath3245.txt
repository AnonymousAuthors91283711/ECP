[write_program]
This problem involves an infinite product of terms defined by a recurrence relation. We'll write a Python program to compute partial products and observe convergence. The recurrence starts with a₀=5/2 and each subsequent term is aₖ = (aₖ₋₁)² - 2.

```python
def compute_terms_and_product(max_terms=20):
    a = [2.5]  # a0 = 5/2
    product_terms = []
    current_product = 1.0
    
    for k in range(1, max_terms + 1):
        # Compute next term using recurrence
        next_a = a[-1]**2 - 2
        a.append(next_a)
        
        # Compute product term (1 - 1/a_k)
        term = 1 - 1/a[-1]
        product_terms.append(term)
        current_product *= term
        
        # Print partial results
        print(f"After {k} terms: product = {current_product}")
        
        # Check for convergence (stop if changes are negligible)
        if k > 1 and abs(product_terms[-1] - 1) < 1e-15:
            break

compute_terms_and_product()
```

The program computes the sequence aₖ and the partial products, printing each new partial product. The recurrence grows very rapidly (doubly exponential), so we limit to 20 terms which is sufficient to observe convergence. The product appears to converge to a specific value, which would be the answer to the problem. The exact closed-form solution would require mathematical analysis beyond this numerical exploration.
