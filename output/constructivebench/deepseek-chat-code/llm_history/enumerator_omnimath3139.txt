[write_program]
This problem involves solving for x given a linear equation with a fixed parameter u. The solution is straightforward algebraic manipulation, but we'll write a Python program to verify the computation and output the exact value.

```python
# Solving x = (1/3)*(3 - 4*u) where u = -6
u = -6
x = (1/3) * (3 - 4 * u)
print(f"x = {x}")  # Output exact value
print(f"x as fraction: {x.as_integer_ratio()}")  # Show exact fractional form
```
