The problem asks to count 6-digit numbers (with leading zeros allowed) where:
1. Each digit is from 1-6
2. All digits are distinct
3. No two adjacent digits differ by exactly 1

We'll enumerate all possible numbers meeting these criteria by generating permutations of digits 1-6 and checking the adjacency condition.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def is_valid(digits):
    for i in range(len(digits)-1):
        if abs(digits[i] - digits[i+1]) == 1:
            return False
    return True

count = 0
for p in permutations(range(1,7)):  # All permutations of digits 1-6
    if is_valid(p):
        count += 1
        print(''.join(map(str, p)))  # Print valid permutations

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```

The program:
1. Generates all permutations of digits 1-6 (6! = 720 possibilities)
2. For each permutation, checks if any adjacent digits differ by 1
3. Prints valid permutations and counts them
4. Finally outputs the total count of valid numbers

Note that since we're dealing with 6-digit numbers with distinct digits 1-6, leading zeros aren't possible (as 0 isn't in our digit set). The problem's original formulation allows leading zeros, but our digit constraints make them impossible.

The output will show all valid permutations and the final count, which is the answer to the problem.
