This problem appears to be about solving for time `t` in the continuous compound interest formula A = P*e^(r*t). The given values are P=8589, r=0.07, A=21337.85. We need to compute t = (1/r)*ln(A/P).

Here's a Python program that calculates this value precisely and also shows the intermediate steps:

```python
import math

def main():
    P = 8589
    r = 0.07
    A = 21337.85
    
    # Calculate the ratio A/P
    ratio = A / P
    print(f"A/P ratio: {ratio}")
    
    # Calculate natural log of the ratio
    log_ratio = math.log(ratio)
    print(f"ln(A/P): {log_ratio}")
    
    # Calculate final time t
    t = (1 / r) * log_ratio
    print(f"Time t: {t}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program outputs:
1. The ratio A/P
2. The natural logarithm of that ratio
3. The final calculated time t

This follows the exact formula given in the problem statement and shows all intermediate calculations. The result will be printed with full floating point precision available in Python.
