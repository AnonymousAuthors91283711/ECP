Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 6)} ∪ {(2^k - 1, 2) | k : ℕ} ∪ {(1, n) | n : ℕ}
Proposed Answer: {(a, n) | a = 1 ∨ (a > 1 ∧ ∃ p : ℕ, p.Prime ∧ p ∣ n)}
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer consists of three cases:
1. The single pair (2,6)
2. All pairs of form (2^k-1, 2) where k is a natural number
3. All pairs (1,n) for any natural number n

The proposed answer claims all pairs where either:
1. a = 1 (which matches part of ground truth)
2. a > 1 and there exists a prime p dividing n

Comparing these:
- The proposed answer correctly includes all (1,n) pairs
- It misses the special case (2,6) from ground truth
- It doesn't capture the (2^k-1,2) cases from ground truth
- It incorrectly includes many pairs where a > 1 and n has a prime factor, which aren't in ground truth

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It's too broad (includes many invalid pairs)
2. It's missing key cases from the ground truth
3. The condition about prime factors of n doesn't match the ground truth's structure
