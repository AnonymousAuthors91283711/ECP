Looking at the pattern in the enumerated answers, we can observe that:
1. When n=0, the result is always 1
2. The results match binomial coefficients multiplied by factorials: (m+n)!/(m-n)! = (2n)! * choose(m+n, 2n)

This suggests the general form is the product of (2n)! and the binomial coefficient C(m+n, 2n).
