This problem asks for the number of functions from a 10-element set to a 3-element set where any two elements with odd difference must map to different values. We'll enumerate valid functions by considering the constraints.

The key observation is that elements with odd differences form a graph where adjacent vertices must have different colors. For Fin 10, this creates two independent sets (even and odd indices) that can be colored separately, with no constraints between them. Each independent set has 5 elements, and we need to count proper 3-colorings for each.

```python
def count_colorings(n, k):
    """Count proper k-colorings for n elements with adjacent elements constrained."""
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return k * (k - 1) ** (n - 1)

def main():
    # Parameters: 10 elements, 3 colors, odd-difference constraint
    # Split into two independent sets of 5 elements each
    colorings_even = count_colorings(5, 3)  # color first independent set
    colorings_odd = count_colorings(5, 3)   # color second independent set
    total = colorings_even * colorings_odd
    print(f"Total valid functions: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
