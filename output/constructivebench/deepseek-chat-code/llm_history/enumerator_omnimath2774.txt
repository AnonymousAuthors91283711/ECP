This problem asks for the smallest natural number n such that any multiset of size n with elements from {0,1,2,3} (with counts bounded by 13,5,1,9 respectively) must contain at least 3 copies of one element. We'll enumerate possible n values and check the condition.

```python
from itertools import product

def is_valid(n):
    # Check all possible counts (a,b,c,d) where a+b+c+d=n
    # with constraints: a<=13, b<=5, c<=1, d<=9
    # and not (a>=3 or b>=3 or c>=3 or d>=3)
    for a in range(0, min(13, n) + 1):
        remaining = n - a
        if remaining < 0:
            continue
        for b in range(0, min(5, remaining) + 1):
            remaining2 = remaining - b
            if remaining2 < 0:
                continue
            for c in range(0, min(1, remaining2) + 1):
                d = remaining2 - c
                if d < 0 or d > 9:
                    continue
                if a < 3 and b < 3 and c < 3 and d < 3:
                    return False
    return True

def find_min_n():
    n = 1
    while True:
        if is_valid(n):
            print(f"Checking n = {n}: Valid")
            # Verify it's minimal by checking n-1
            if n > 1 and not is_valid(n-1):
                print(f"Minimal valid n found: {n}")
                break
        else:
            print(f"Checking n = {n}: Invalid")
        n += 1

find_min_n()
```
