  HasSum (fun n : ℕ => (1 : ℚ) / ((n + 3)^2 + (n + 1))) omnimath1314_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 13/36
Proposed Answer: 1/2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the sum of an infinite series: Σ (1/((n+3)² + (n+1))) from n=0 to ∞.

2. The ground truth answer is given as 13/36 ≈ 0.3611.

3. The proposed answer is 1/2 = 0.5.

4. Let's check the first few terms to see which answer makes more sense:
   - n=0: 1/(3² + 1) = 1/10 = 0.1
   - n=1: 1/(4² + 2) = 1/18 ≈ 0.0556
   - n=2: 1/(5² + 3) = 1/28 ≈ 0.0357
   - Sum of first 3 terms ≈ 0.1913

The series clearly converges to something less than 1/2, and the partial sums are approaching something closer to 13/36 than 1/2.
