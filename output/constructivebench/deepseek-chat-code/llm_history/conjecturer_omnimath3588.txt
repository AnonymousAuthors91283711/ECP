abbrev omnimath3588_answer : Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath3588 :
  (∃ p : ℕ, p.Prime ∧ (∃ k ≥ 1, p = 3 * 10^(2 + k) + 8 * 10^(1 + k) + ∑ i in Finset.range k, 10^i)) ↔ omnimath3588_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for primes with k from 1 to 10
Found prime for k=2: 38011. Expected Answer Type: Prop
<<<True>>> 

Explanation: The pattern shows that for k=2, p=38011 is prime. Since we found at least one prime satisfying the condition, the existential statement is true. The answer is simply `True` as we've demonstrated existence.
