This problem involves calculating the probability that a certain condition is met in a graph traversal scenario. We'll enumerate the valid moves and count successful outcomes for a simplified version of the problem (smaller graph sizes) to help understand the pattern.

The problem describes:
- A graph with 6 vertices (Fin 6)
- Each vertex has some adjacency relation (adj)
- Valid moves are functions where each vertex maps to one of its neighbors
- We need to count successful outcomes where some condition is met (represented by 5*4^4)
- The probability is successful_outcomes / total_outcomes (4^6)

We'll create a simplified version with smaller graphs (2-5 vertices) to observe the pattern.

```python
from itertools import product
from fractions import Fraction

def enumerate_graph_probabilities(max_vertices=5):
    for n in range(2, max_vertices + 1):
        # Assume complete graph (each vertex connected to all others)
        # Valid moves: any function where f(v) is a neighbor (all vertices except possibly itself)
        # For complete graph, all functions are valid except constant functions
        total_outcomes = (n-1)**n
        # The successful outcomes formula from problem: 5*4^4 when n=6
        # We'll use n*(n-1)^(n-2) as a guess for smaller n
        successful_outcomes = n * (n-1)**(n-2) if n > 1 else 0
        
        print(f"Vertices: {n}")
        print(f"Total outcomes: {total_outcomes}")
        print(f"Successful outcomes (hypothesis): {successful_outcomes}")
        if total_outcomes > 0:
            prob = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes)
            print(f"Probability: {prob} = {float(prob)}")
        print()

enumerate_graph_probabilities()
