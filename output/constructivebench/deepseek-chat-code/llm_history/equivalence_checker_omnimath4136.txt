Ground Truth Answer: {⟨11, 1⟩, ⟨49, 1⟩} ∪ {⟨7 * t ^ 2, 7 * t⟩ | t : ℤ}
Proposed Answer: ({⟨7, 7⟩, ⟨11, 1⟩, ⟨28, 14⟩, ⟨49, 1⟩, ⟨63, 21⟩} : Set (ℤ × ℤ)) ∪ 
(Set.range (fun (x : ℤ) => ⟨x, 1⟩) ∩ {p | p.1 > 0}) ∪ 
(Set.range (fun (k : ℤ) => ⟨7*k, k⟩) ∩ {p | p.2 > 0})
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth and proposed answers.

1. The ground truth has two parts:
   - Explicit pairs: ⟨11, 1⟩ and ⟨49, 1⟩
   - A parameterized family: ⟨7*t², 7*t⟩ for t ∈ ℤ

2. The proposed answer has three parts:
   - Explicit pairs: ⟨7,7⟩, ⟨11,1⟩, ⟨28,14⟩, ⟨49,1⟩, ⟨63,21⟩
   - All pairs ⟨x,1⟩ where x > 0
   - All pairs ⟨7k,k⟩ where k > 0

Comparison:
- Both include ⟨11,1⟩ and ⟨49,1⟩
- The ground truth's parameterized family ⟨7*t²,7*t⟩ is partially covered by the proposed answer's ⟨7k,k⟩ when t > 0, but misses cases where t ≤ 0
- The proposed answer includes many extra solutions (all ⟨x,1⟩ with x>0 and ⟨7k,k⟩ with k>0) that aren't in the ground truth
- Some explicit pairs in the proposed answer (like ⟨7,7⟩) don't match the ground truth's pattern

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It includes many invalid solutions
2. It's missing negative t cases from the parameterized family
3. Some explicit pairs don't fit the ground truth's pattern
