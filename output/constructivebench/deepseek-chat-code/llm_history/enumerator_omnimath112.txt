This problem involves finding all rational functions f: ℚ → ℚ that satisfy a given functional equation. To approach this, we'll enumerate possible polynomial solutions of low degree (since rational functions are ratios of polynomials). We'll test linear and quadratic forms first, as these are common in such problems.

The functional equation is:
f(2xy + 1/2) + f(x - y) = 4f(x)f(y) + 1/2

We'll try to find polynomial solutions f(x) = ax + b (linear) and f(x) = ax² + bx + c (quadratic).

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def test_linear():
    print("Testing linear solutions f(x) = a*x + b")
    a, b = symbols('a b')
    # Substitute f(x) = a*x + b into the functional equation
    # We'll pick specific x,y values to create equations
    # x=0, y=0: f(1/2) + f(0) = 4f(0)f(0) + 1/2
    # => (a/2 + b) + b = 4b² + 1/2
    eq1 = (a/2 + b) + b - (4*b*b + Fraction(1,2))
    
    # x=1, y=0: f(1/2) + f(1) = 4f(1)f(0) + 1/2
    # => (a/2 + b) + (a + b) = 4(a + b)*b + 1/2
    eq2 = (a/2 + b) + (a + b) - (4*(a + b)*b + Fraction(1,2))
    
    # Solve the system
    solutions = solve([eq1, eq2], (a, b))
    for sol in solutions:
        a_val, b_val = sol[a], sol[b]
        print(f"Found solution: f(x) = {a_val}*x + {b_val}")

def test_quadratic():
    print("\nTesting quadratic solutions f(x) = a*x² + b*x + c")
    a, b, c = symbols('a b c')
    # We'll need more equations for quadratic case
    # x=0,y=0: f(1/2) + f(0) = 4f(0)² + 1/2
    eq1 = (a/4 + b/2 + c) + c - (4*c*c + Fraction(1,2))
    
    # x=1,y=0: f(1/2) + f(1) = 4f(1)f(0) + 1/2
    eq2 = (a/4 + b/2 + c) + (a + b + c) - (4*(a + b + c)*c + Fraction(1,2))
    
    # x=1,y=1: f(5/2) + f(0) = 4f(1)² + 1/2
    eq3 = (a*25/4 + b*5/2 + c) + c - (4*(a + b + c)**2 + Fraction(1,2))
    
    solutions = solve([eq1, eq2, eq3], (a, b, c))
    for sol in solutions:
        a_val, b_val, c_val = sol[a], sol[b], sol[c]
        print(f"Found solution: f(x) = {a_val}*x² + {b_val}*x + {c_val}")

    from sympy import symbols, solve
    test_linear()
    test_quadratic()
    print("\nNote: The program tests for polynomial solutions. The actual solution might be more complex.")
