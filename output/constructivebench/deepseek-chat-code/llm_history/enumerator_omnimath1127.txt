This problem involves counting the number of positions (s) in a 9×9 grid where the number of rectangle pairs (r) containing s in a specific way is even. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible positions s=(i,j) in a 9×9 grid and count how many satisfy the evenness condition.

The condition requires counting rectangle pairs r=((a,b),(c,d)) where:
1. a ≤ i ≤ c
2. b ≤ j ≤ d
3. a ≤ c
4. b ≤ d

For each s=(i,j), the number of such rectangles is (i+1)*(9-i)*(j+1)*(9-j). We need to count how many s positions make this product even.

```python
count = 0
n = 9
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        # Calculate number of rectangles containing (i,j)
        rectangles = (i + 1) * (n - i) * (j + 1) * (n - j)
        if rectangles % 2 == 0:
            count += 1
            print(f"Position ({i+1},{j+1}) has {rectangles} rectangles (even)")
print(f"Total positions with even rectangles: {count}")
```
