[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number n such that 2024 divides n!. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal n by checking factorials incrementally until we find one divisible by 2024.

The approach:
1. Factorize 2024 to understand its prime components (2024 = 2³ × 11 × 23)
2. For each candidate n, check if its factorial contains at least these prime factors with sufficient exponents
3. The minimal n will be the maximum of the minimal numbers needed for each prime power factor

```python
def min_n_factorial_divisible_by(m):
    # Factorize m into prime powers
    def factorize(num):
        factors = {}
        if num == 1:
            return factors
        # Check for 2 separately
        while num % 2 == 0:
            factors[2] = factors.get(2, 0) + 1
            num = num // 2
        # Check odd divisors up to sqrt(num)
        i = 3
        while i * i <= num:
            while num % i == 0:
                factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
                num = num // i
            i += 2
        if num > 1:
            factors[num] = factors.get(num, 0) + 1
        return factors
    
    factors = factorize(m)
    if not factors:
        return 0  # m=1 case
    
    # For each prime p, find minimal n where n! has at least exponent e of p
    def min_n_for_prime(p, e):
        n = 0
        total = 0
        while total < e:
            n += 1
            num = n
            count = 0
            while num % p == 0:
                num = num // p
                count += 1
            total += count
        return n
    
    max_n = 0
    for p, e in factors.items():
        current_n = min_n_for_prime(p, e)
        if current_n > max_n:
            max_n = current_n
        print(f"For prime {p}^{e}, minimal n is {current_n}")
    
    print(f"\nFinal answer (minimal n where {m} divides n!): {max_n}")
    return max_n

# Solve for 2024
min_n_factorial_divisible_by(2024)
```
