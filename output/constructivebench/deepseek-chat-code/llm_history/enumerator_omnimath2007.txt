This problem asks us to find all possible digits A, B, C (each between 0 and 9) such that the number N = 5,000,000 + A×100,000 + B×10,000 + 3,000 + 700 + C×10 + 2 is divisible by 792. We need to enumerate all valid (A,B,C) triples.

The approach is:
1. Simplify N to 5,A,B,3,7,C,2 in digits
2. Factor 792 = 8×9×11
3. Check divisibility by 8, 9, and 11 separately
4. Enumerate all possible digit combinations (10^3 = 1000 possibilities)

```python
def is_divisible_by_792(a, b, c):
    # Construct the number N = 5AB37C2
    n = 5000000 + a * 100000 + b * 10000 + 3000 + 700 + c * 10 + 2
    
    # Check divisibility by 792 (8*9*11)
    if n % 8 != 0:
        return False
    if n % 9 != 0:
        return False
    if n % 11 != 0:
        return False
    return True

def main():
    print("Searching for (A,B,C) such that 5AB37C2 is divisible by 792:")
    solutions = []
    for a in range(10):
        for b in range(10):
            for c in range(10):
                if is_divisible_by_792(a, b, c):
                    print(f"Found solution: ({a}, {b}, {c})")
                    solutions.append((a, b, c))
    
    print("\nAll solutions:")
    for sol in solutions:
        print(sol)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
