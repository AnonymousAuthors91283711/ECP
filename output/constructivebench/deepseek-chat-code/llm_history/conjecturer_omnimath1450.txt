Based on the problem statement and the enumerated answer (0.270833... which equals 13/48), I notice that:
1. The proposed answer 11/48 is incorrect
2. The error message is about syntax (missing semicolons/line breaks), but the mathematical answer needs correction
3. The problem involves calculating the probability of collision between two intervals moving at the same speed

The correct answer should be 13/48, derived from analyzing the overlapping time intervals where max(a,b) < min(a+0.75,b+0.75) within the given ranges.

Based on the problem statement and the enumerated answer (0.270833... which equals 13/48), I'll provide the correct Lean answer. The error in the original code appears to be formatting-related (missing line breaks between let bindings), but the mathematical content is correct.

The problem involves calculating the probability that two intervals (A from 0 to 5.5 and B from 0.5 to 3.5) overlap when each is extended by 0.75 units. The correct probability is indeed 13/48, which matches the enumerated computation.
