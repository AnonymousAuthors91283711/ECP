[write_program]
This problem asks to find the unique real number x between 0 and 90 that satisfies the equation (90 - x) = 0.25 * (180 - x). We'll write a Python program to numerically approximate the solution by testing values in this range with small increments.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible x values from 0 to 90 in small steps
2. For each x, compute both sides of the equation
3. Print x values where the difference between both sides is very small
4. The solution should be unique based on the problem statement

```python
def find_solution():
    # We'll search in the range (0,90) with small steps
    step = 0.0001
    tolerance = 1e-8
    
    x = step  # start just above 0
    while x < 90:
        left_side = 90 - x
        right_side = 0.25 * (180 - x)
        difference = abs(left_side - right_side)
        
        if difference < tolerance:
            print(f"Found candidate solution: x = {x:.6f}")
            print(f"Verification: 90-{x:.6f} = {left_side:.6f}, 0.25*(180-{x:.6f}) = {right_side:.6f}")
        
        x += step

    find_solution()
