[write_program]
This problem involves finding natural number pairs (x, y) where the equation (7x² - 13xy + 7y²)^(1/3) = |x - y| + 1 holds true. We'll write a Python program to search for such pairs efficiently.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible x and y values up to a reasonable limit
2. For each pair, compute both sides of the equation
3. Check if they're approximately equal (accounting for floating point precision)
4. Output valid pairs as they're found

```python
def find_pairs(max_n=1000):
    for x in range(1, max_n + 1):
        for y in range(1, max_n + 1):
            left = (7 * x**2 - 13 * x * y + 7 * y**2) ** (1/3)
            right = abs(x - y) + 1
            # Check approximate equality with tolerance for floating point errors
            if abs(left - right) < 1e-9:
                print(f"Found pair: ({x}, {y})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Searching for pairs (x, y) where (7x²-13xy+7y²)^(1/3) = |x-y| + 1")
    find_pairs()
    print("Search completed up to n=1000")
```
