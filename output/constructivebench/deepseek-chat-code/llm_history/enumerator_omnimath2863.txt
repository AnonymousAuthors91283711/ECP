The problem is asking for the cardinality of the set of all functions from `Fin 3` (which represents the set {0,1,2}) to `Bool` (which has two elements: true and false). This is equivalent to counting all possible truth tables with 3 inputs.

For a general finite set A with n elements and B with m elements, the number of functions from A to B is m^n. Here, A has 3 elements and B has 2 elements, so the answer should be 2^3 = 8.

We'll write a Python program that enumerates all possible functions from a 3-element set to a 2-element set by generating all possible truth tables.

```python
def main():
    # The set {0,1,2} representing Fin 3
    domain = [0, 1, 2]
    # The boolean values True and False
    codomain = [False, True]
    
    count = 0
    # Generate all possible functions by considering all combinations of outputs
    for a in codomain:
        for b in codomain:
            for c in codomain:
                count += 1
                # Print each function as a truth table
                print(f"Function {count}: f(0)={a}, f(1)={b}, f(2)={c}")
    
    print(f"Total number of functions: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
