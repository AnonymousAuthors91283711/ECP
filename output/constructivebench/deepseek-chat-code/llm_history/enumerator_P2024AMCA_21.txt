[write_program]
This problem involves finding the greatest integer k such that k ≤ the sum of a series defined recursively. The series starts with a₁=2 and each subsequent term adds 1/n. The sum is given to be 338551.5. We'll write a Python program to compute partial sums of this series until we find the largest integer less than or equal to the total sum.

The approach is:
1. Start with a₁ = 2
2. For each n ≥ 2, compute aₙ = aₙ₋₁ + 1/n
3. Sum all terms until the sum converges to 338551.5
4. Find the largest integer k ≤ this sum

```python
def compute_series():
    total = 2.0  # a₁ = 2
    n = 2
    while True:
        term = 1.0 / n
        total += term
        if n % 100000 == 0:  # Print progress periodically
            print(f"n={n}, current_sum={total}")
        if total >= 338551.5:
            break
        n += 1
    
    print(f"Final sum: {total}")
    print(f"Largest integer k ≤ sum: {int(total)}")

Note: In practice, this computation would take an extremely long time to reach n large enough for the sum to approach 338551.5. The harmonic series grows logarithmically, so reaching this sum would require an enormous n. The program is theoretically correct but not practical for actually finding the answer. For the actual competition problem, mathematical analysis would be needed rather than brute-force computation.
