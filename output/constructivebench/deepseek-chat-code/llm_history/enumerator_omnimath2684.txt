The problem asks to find the sum of all two-digit numbers (10 ≤ x ≤ 99) where 109 modulo x equals 4. We need to enumerate all such numbers and compute their sum.

The approach is:
1. Iterate through all numbers from 10 to 99
2. For each number, check if 109 % x == 4
3. Collect all numbers satisfying the condition and sum them

```python
def main():
    total = 0
    for x in range(10, 100):
        if 109 % x == 4:
            print(f"Found valid x: {x}")
            total += x
    print(f"Sum of all valid numbers: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
