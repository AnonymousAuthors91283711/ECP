The problem simplifies the function `fun x => 4 * x / (x + 2 * x)` evaluated at `x = 2021`. Let's analyze this mathematically first:

1. The denominator simplifies to `x + 2x = 3x`
2. The function becomes `4x / 3x = 4/3` for any x ≠ 0
3. Therefore, the answer is `4/3` regardless of the input value (as long as x ≠ 0)

Since the problem is about evaluating this function at x=2021, we can write a simple Python program that demonstrates this simplification for multiple values, showing the pattern that the result is always 4/3.

```python
def evaluate_function(x):
    numerator = 4 * x
    denominator = x + 2 * x
    return numerator / denominator

# Test with several values including 2021
test_values = [1, 2, 10, 100, 2021, 10000]
for x in test_values:
    result = evaluate_function(x)
    print(f"x = {x}: {result}")

# The exact value is always 4/3
from fractions import Fraction
print("Exact value:", Fraction(4, 3))
```
