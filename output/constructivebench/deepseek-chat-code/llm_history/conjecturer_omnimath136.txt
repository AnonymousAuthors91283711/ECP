abbrev omnimath136_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath136
: {p : ℕ | Nat.Prime p ∧ ∃ x y : ℤ, x > 0 ∧ y > 0 ∧ x * (y ^ 2 - p) + y * (x ^ 2 - p) = 5 * p} = omnimath136_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for primes p where the equation has solutions:
Found p=2 with (x,y)=(1,4)
Found p=3 with (x,y)=(2,3)
Found p=7 with (x,y)=(3,4). Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{2, 3, 7}>>>
