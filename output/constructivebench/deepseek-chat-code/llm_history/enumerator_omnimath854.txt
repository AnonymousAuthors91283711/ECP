[write_program]
This problem asks for the count of numbers `n` between 1 and 2004 where the exponent of 7 in the prime factorization of `n!` equals the exponent of 2 in `n!` (since 8 is 2^3). We'll write a Python program to count such numbers efficiently.

The key insight is that for a prime `p`, the exponent in `n!` is given by Legendre's formula: sum_{k=1}^âˆž floor(n/p^k). For 7, we compute this directly. For 2, we compute floor(n/2) + floor(n/4) + ... and then divide by 3 (since we're comparing with 8=2^3).

```python
def count_special_numbers(max_n=2004):
    count = 0
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        # Compute exponent of 7 in n!
        exp7 = 0
        p = 7
        while p <= n:
            exp7 += n // p
            p *= 7
        
        # Compute exponent of 2 in n! divided by 3
        exp2 = 0
        p = 2
        while p <= n:
            exp2 += n // p
            p *= 2
        exp8 = exp2 // 3
        
        if exp7 == exp8:
            count += 1
            print(n)  # Stream partial results
    
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

count_special_numbers()
```
