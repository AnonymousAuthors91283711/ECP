This problem involves evaluating a simple algebraic expression with a given value of `a`. The task is to compute the value of `(2 * a⁻¹ + (a⁻¹ / 2)) / a` where `a = 1/2`. Since this is a straightforward calculation, we'll compute it exactly using Python's fractions module to avoid floating-point approximations.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_expression():
    a = Fraction(1, 2)  # a = 1/2
    numerator = 2 * (1/a) + ((1/a) / 2)
    result = numerator / a
    print(result)  # Prints exact fractional result

compute_expression()
```
