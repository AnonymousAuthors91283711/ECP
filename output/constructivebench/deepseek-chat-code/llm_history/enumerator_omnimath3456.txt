[write_program]
This problem asks to simplify √(3³ + 3³ + 3³) and find its exact value. We'll write a Python program to compute this expression and verify the simplification.

The approach is straightforward:
1. Compute 3³ = 27
2. Sum three copies: 27 + 27 + 27 = 81
3. Take square root: √81 = 9

The program will compute this step-by-step and output the exact value.

```python
# Compute √(3³ + 3³ + 3³) step by step
cube = 3 ** 3
sum_of_cubes = cube + cube + cube
square_root = sum_of_cubes ** 0.5

# Output exact value if it's an integer, otherwise approximate
if square_root == int(square_root):
    print(int(square_root))
else:
    print(square_root)
```
