Found solution: n = 2016
Found solution: n = 2019
Progress: checked up to n=3000
Progress: checked up to n=4000
Progress: checked up to n=5000
Progress: checked up to n=6000

All solutions found:
1346
2016
2019. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Looking at the enumerated solutions (1346, 2016, 2019) and factoring 2019 = 3 × 673, the pattern suggests numbers where n and 2019 share the same prime factors. The answer appears to be numbers divisible by both 3 and 673.

<<<{n | 3 ∣ n ∧ 673 ∣ n}>>>
