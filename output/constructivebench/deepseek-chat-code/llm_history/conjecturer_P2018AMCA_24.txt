Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the enumerated answers, we observe that the maximum area occurs around c ≈ 0.541. The problem involves finding the c that maximizes the area between two intervals [0,1] and [1/2,2/3]. The optimal c appears to be at the harmonic mean of the interval boundaries, which for [1/2, 2/3] would be 2*(1/2)*(2/3)/(1/2 + 2/3) = 4/7 ≈ 0.571. However, the data shows peak slightly lower, suggesting the optimal c is where the derivative of the area function is zero.
