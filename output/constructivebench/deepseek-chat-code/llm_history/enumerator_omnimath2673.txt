[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of positive integer pairs (a, b) such that a² + b² = 50. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such pairs and count them.

The approach is:
1. Iterate through possible values of a from 1 to √50 (since a² must be ≤ 50)
2. For each a, check if (50 - a²) is a perfect square
3. If yes, then b is the square root of that value
4. Count all valid (a, b) pairs where both a and b are positive integers

```python
import math

def count_pairs():
    count = 0
    max_a = int(math.isqrt(50))  # Maximum possible a value
    print("Possible (a, b) pairs:")
    for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
        remainder = 50 - a*a
        if remainder <= 0:
            continue
        b = math.isqrt(remainder)
        if b*b == remainder and b > 0:
            print(f"({a}, {b})")
            count += 1
    print(f"Total number of pairs: {count}")

count_pairs()
```
