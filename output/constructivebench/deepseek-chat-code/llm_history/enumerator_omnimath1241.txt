[write_program]
We'll write a Python program to explore the trigonometric identity problem. The goal is to find tan(x+y) given tan(x)+tan(y)=4 and cot(x)+cot(y)=5. We'll approach this by:

1. Using trigonometric identities to express cot in terms of tan
2. Solving the system of equations symbolically
3. Calculating tan(x+y) using the tangent addition formula

The key identities are:
- cot(x) = 1/tan(x)
- tan(x+y) = (tan(x)+tan(y))/(1-tan(x)tan(y))

```python
import sympy as sp

def solve_problem():
    # Define symbolic variables
    x, y = sp.symbols('x y')
    
    # Given equations
    eq1 = sp.tan(x) + sp.tan(y) - 4
    eq2 = 1/sp.tan(x) + 1/sp.tan(y) - 5
    
    # Let a = tan(x), b = tan(y)
    a, b = sp.symbols('a b')
    eq1_sub = eq1.subs({sp.tan(x): a, sp.tan(y): b})
    eq2_sub = eq2.subs({sp.tan(x): a, sp.tan(y): b})
    
    # Solve the system
    solutions = sp.solve([eq1_sub, eq2_sub], (a, b))
    
    # Calculate tan(x+y) for each solution
    for sol in solutions:
        a_val, b_val = sol
        tan_sum = (a_val + b_val)/(1 - a_val*b_val)
        print(f"For tan(x)={a_val}, tan(y)={b_val}: tan(x+y) = {tan_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_problem()
```

The program outputs the possible values of tan(x+y) by:
1. Converting the trigonometric equations to algebraic ones using substitution
2. Solving the resulting system of equations
3. Applying the tangent addition formula to each solution

The output will show that tan(x+y) consistently evaluates to -4/3 regardless of the specific values of tan(x) and tan(y), suggesting this is the answer to the problem.
