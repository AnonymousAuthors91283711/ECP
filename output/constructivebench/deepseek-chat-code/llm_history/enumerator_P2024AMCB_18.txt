[write_program]
The problem defines a recursive function F similar to the Fibonacci sequence (F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2) for nâ‰¥3) and asks for the sum of F(n) from n=1 to 10. We'll write a Python program to compute this sum by first generating the sequence values and then summing them.

```python
def compute_sequence_sum():
    # Initialize the sequence with given values
    F = [0] * 11  # Using 1-based indexing
    F[1] = 1
    F[2] = 1
    
    # Compute sequence values up to F[10]
    for n in range(3, 11):
        F[n] = F[n-1] + F[n-2]
    
    # Calculate the sum from F[1] to F[10]
    sequence_sum = sum(F[1:11])
    
    # Print intermediate values for verification
    print("Sequence values from F(1) to F(10):")
    for n in range(1, 11):
        print(f"F({n}) = {F[n]}")
    
    print(f"\nSum of F(1) to F(10): {sequence_sum}")
