  ∃ k, k ∈ {k : ℕ | let total := 4 + 5 + 7;
                    let new_total := total - k;

Ground Truth Answer: 12
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. First, calculate the total: 4 + 5 + 7 = 16
2. The equation given is: 2 * (4/16) = 4/(16 - k)
3. Simplify: 2 * (1/4) = 4/(16 - k) → 1/2 = 4/(16 - k)
4. Cross multiply: 16 - k = 8 → k = 8

The ground truth answer is 12, but according to this calculation, the correct answer should be 8. The proposed answer matches our calculation, while the ground truth answer does not.
