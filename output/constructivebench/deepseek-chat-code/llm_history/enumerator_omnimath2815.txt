[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of two equations with two variables (x and y). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible (x,y) pairs that satisfy both equations, then compute their product x*y. Since exact solutions are preferred, we'll use symbolic computation via sympy.

The approach is:
1. Solve the first equation for y in terms of x
2. Substitute into the second equation to get a quadratic in x
3. Find exact solutions using sympy's solve function
4. Compute x*y for each valid solution

```python
import sympy as sp

def solve_problem():
    x, y = sp.symbols('x y')
    
    # Define the equations
    eq1 = sp.Eq(3*x + 2*y, 6)
    eq2 = sp.Eq(9*x**2 + 4*y**2, 468)
    
    # Solve first equation for y
    y_expr = sp.solve(eq1, y)[0]
    
    # Substitute into second equation
    eq2_sub = eq2.subs(y, y_expr)
    
    # Solve for x
    x_solutions = sp.solve(eq2_sub, x)
    
    # For each x solution, find y and compute x*y
    for x_sol in x_solutions:
        y_sol = y_expr.subs(x, x_sol)
        xy = x_sol * y_sol
        print(f"Solution found: x = {x_sol}, y = {y_sol}, x*y = {xy}")
    
    # Also print simplified exact form of x*y
    xy_symbolic = x * y_expr
    print(f"\nSymbolic form of x*y: {xy_symbolic.simplify()}")
