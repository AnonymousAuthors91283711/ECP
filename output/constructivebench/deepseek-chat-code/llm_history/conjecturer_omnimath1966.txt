<<<1 / Real.sqrt 2>>> 

Explanation: The problem resembles a minimization of a₀ under given constraints. The enumerated answers didn't yield solutions, but the structure suggests a relationship with the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The minimal value likely occurs when a₀ = b₀ and ra = rb, leading to the solution 1/√2, which satisfies the equality condition in Cauchy-Schwarz.
