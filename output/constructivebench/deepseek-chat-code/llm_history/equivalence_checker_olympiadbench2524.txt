Ground Truth Answer: {2^(-2/3 : ℝ), 8}
Proposed Answer: {8, 1/2^(1/3)}
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. The ground truth answer is {2^(-2/3), 8}
2. The proposed answer is {8, 1/2^(1/3)}

Let's simplify both expressions:
- 2^(-2/3) = 1/(2^(2/3)) = (1/2^(1/3))^2
- 1/2^(1/3) = 2^(-1/3)

These are clearly different values:
- 2^(-2/3) ≈ 0.62996
- 2^(-1/3) ≈ 0.79370

The proposed answer contains 8 (which is correct) but the second solution is incorrect - it should be 2^(-2/3) rather than 2^(-1/3).
