Ground Truth Answer: 15 * (2013)!
Proposed Answer: 2013 * (2013^3 + 6 * 2013^2 + 8 * 2013 + 3)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting fixed points in permutations of a finite set (Fin 2013) and summing their fourth powers over all permutations.

2. The ground truth answer is 15 * (2013)!, which is a clean factorial expression.

3. The proposed answer expands into a polynomial expression in terms of 2013.

4. For such permutation problems, factorial expressions are typical in correct answers, while polynomial expansions are unusual unless they can be simplified to factorial form.

5. The proposed answer doesn't appear to simplify to the ground truth answer, nor does it match the expected form for such permutation problems.

6. The numbers don't align - 15 * (2013)! is vastly different from the polynomial expression proposed.
