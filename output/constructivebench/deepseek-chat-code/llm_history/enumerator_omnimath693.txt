This problem involves computing a large product modulo 100, where each term in the product is either (580 - 10*k) for k from 0 to 57 or 9, and each multiplication is followed by subtracting 2. The final result is taken modulo 100.

To solve this efficiently, we'll compute the sequence step by step, keeping only the last two digits (mod 100) at each step since that's all we need for the final result. We'll generate the sequence of numbers as specified, then apply the fold operation with the given function.

```python
def main():
    # Generate the sequence: [580-10*k for k in 0..57] + [9]
    sequence = [580 - 10 * k for k in range(58)] + [9]
    
    # Initialize accumulator with 1 as specified
    acc = 1
    
    for b in sequence:
        # Compute next value: acc * b - 2, keeping only last 2 digits
        acc = (acc * b - 2) % 100
        # Print intermediate results for observation
        print(f"After {b}: {acc}")
    
    # Final answer is the last computed value
    print(f"Final answer: {acc}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
