This problem asks for the real number x such that when we iterate the function f(y) = |y| + x starting from 0 exactly 2017 times, we get 1. We need to find this unique x value.

The approach is to:
1. Understand the iteration pattern - each application adds x but the absolute value makes it non-decreasing
2. For n iterations, the final value will be k*x where k depends on how many times the sign flipped
3. For odd n=2017, we can derive that x must be 1/2017 since all iterations will be positive

Here's a Python program that verifies this by testing the iteration for x=1/2017:

```python
def verify_solution(x, n):
    y = 0
    for _ in range(n):
        y = abs(y) + x
    return y

n = 2017
x = 1/n
result = verify_solution(x, n)
print(f"For x = {x}, after {n} iterations: {result} (should be 1)")
```
