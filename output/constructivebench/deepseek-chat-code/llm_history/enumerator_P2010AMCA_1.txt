The problem appears to be evaluating a simple arithmetic expression involving parentheses and subtraction operations. The expression is:

(20 - (2010 - 201) + (2010 - (201 - 20) : ‚Ñù)

We can compute this directly by breaking it down step by step. The solution involves evaluating the nested parentheses first, then performing the remaining operations.

```python
def compute_expression():
    # First evaluate innermost parentheses (201 - 20)
    inner = 201 - 20
    
    # Then evaluate (2010 - inner)
    second_term = 2010 - inner
    
    # Evaluate (2010 - 201)
    first_inner = 2010 - 201
    
    # Now compute the main expression (20 - first_inner + second_term)
    result = 20 - first_inner + second_term
    
    print(f"Computed result: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_expression()
```
