This problem involves counting the number of pairs of sequences (b, c) of length 2018 derived from a binary sequence a of length 2019, with specific constraints. To make it computationally tractable, we'll analyze smaller cases (n=1,2,3) to identify a pattern.

The key observations:
1. Each a_i must be < 2^2018 (but for small n, this becomes < 2^n)
2. b and c sequences are built from adjacent pairs in a
3. c uses bitwise OR operation

We'll enumerate valid (b,c) pairs for small n and count them.

```python
def count_valid_pairs(n):
    from itertools import product
    
    count = 0
    # Generate all possible binary sequences of length n+1
    for a in product([0,1], repeat=n+1):
        valid = True
        b = []
        c = []
        for i in range(n):
            ai, aip1 = a[i], a[i+1]
            bi = ai + aip1
            ci = ai | aip1
            b.append(bi)
            c.append(ci)
            # Check constraints
            if bi < 0 or ci < 0:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1
            # Print first few examples to show structure
            if count <= 3 and n <= 3:
                print(f"Example {count} for n={n}:")
                print(f"a: {a}")
                print(f"b: {b}")
                print(f"c: {c}\n")
    return count

# Analyze small cases to identify pattern
for n in range(1, 5):
    total = count_valid_pairs(n)
    print(f"Total valid (b,c) pairs for n={n}: {total}\n")

# The pattern suggests the answer is 3*2^(n-1), but we need to verify
# For n=2018, the answer would be 3*2^2017, but we can't compute that directly
```
