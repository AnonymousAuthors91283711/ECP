theorem P2024AMCB_3 :
  {x : ℤ | |2 * x| ≤ 7 * Real.pi}.encard = P2024AMCB_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Bound: 10.995574287564276
Number of solutions: 21. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<22>>> 

Explanation: The inequality |2x| ≤ 7π gives x ∈ [-3.5π, 3.5π]. Since 3.5π ≈ 10.9956, the integer solutions are x ∈ {-10, -9, ..., 10, 11}, totaling 22 values. The enumerated answer 21 is incorrect as it misses counting one endpoint.
