[write_program]
This problem involves evaluating a triple infinite sum with conditional terms. To approach it computationally, we'll:
1. Truncate the sums to finite ranges for approximation
2. Skip terms where any variable is 0 (as per the condition)
3. Compute the terms efficiently and accumulate the sum
4. Print partial sums to observe convergence

Here's a Python program that approximates this sum by considering a,b,c up to N=20 (which should give reasonable convergence for this type of problem):

```python
def compute_term(a, b, c):
    if a == 0 or b == 0 or c == 0:
        return 0.0
    numerator = a * b * (3 * a + c)
    denominator = (4 ** (a + b + c)) * (a + b) * (b + c) * (c + a)
    return numerator / denominator

def approximate_sum(N):
    total = 0.0
    for a in range(1, N+1):
        for b in range(1, N+1):
            for c in range(1, N+1):
                term = compute_term(a, b, c)
                total += term
                # Print partial sums occasionally to observe convergence
                if (a == b == c) and (a % 5 == 0 or a <= 5):
                    print(f"Partial sum at a=b=c={a}: {total}")
    return total

if __name__ == "__main__":
    N = 20
    print(f"Approximating sum with N={N}")
    final_sum = approximate_sum(N)
    print(f"Final approximation: {final_sum}")
```

The program computes the sum by:
1. Defining the term computation with the given formula
2. Iterating through all combinations of a,b,c from 1 to N
3. Printing partial sums when a=b=c (diagonal terms) to show convergence
4. Outputting the final approximation

Note that this is an approximation - the exact value would require analytical techniques beyond numerical computation. The partial sums printed help observe how quickly the series converges.
