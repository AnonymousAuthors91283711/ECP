[write_program]
This problem asks to find all positive real numbers x and y that satisfy both equations:
1. y = log(x^4)/log(10)
2. y = (log(x)/log(10))^3

We'll write a Python program to numerically search for solutions by:
1. Iterating through possible x values in a reasonable range (0.1 to 100)
2. Calculating both y values from each equation
3. Checking when they are approximately equal (within a small epsilon)

```python
import math

def find_solutions():
    epsilon = 1e-8  # Tolerance for floating point comparison
    step = 0.0001   # Smaller step for more precision
    solutions = []
    
    # Search in range (0.1, 100)
    x = 0.1
    while x <= 100:
        log10x = math.log10(x)
        y1 = math.log10(x**4)  # First equation
        y2 = log10x ** 3       # Second equation
        
        if abs(y1 - y2) < epsilon:
            solutions.append((x, y1))
            print(f"Found solution: x = {x:.6f}, y = {y1:.6f}")
        
        x += step
    
    # After scanning, print all found solutions
    print("\nAll solutions found:")
    for sol in solutions:
        print(f"x = {sol[0]:.6f}, y = {sol[1]:.6f}")

find_solutions()
```
