This problem is about finding natural numbers p and n that satisfy three conditions:
1. p + n = 13
2. n + 1 = p
3. p + 5*n equals some answer we need to find

We'll enumerate possible values of p and n that satisfy the first two equations, then compute p + 5*n for the valid pair.

```python
def find_solution():
    # Iterate through possible n values (natural numbers)
    for n in range(1, 14):  # Since p + n = 13, max n is 12 (as p >=1)
        p = n + 1  # From second condition
        if p + n == 13:  # Check first condition
            result = p + 5 * n
            print(f"n={n}, p={p}, p+5n={result}")
            # Since there's only one solution, we can break after finding it
            break

find_solution()
```
