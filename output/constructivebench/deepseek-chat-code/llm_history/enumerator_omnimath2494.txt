[write_program]
This problem involves analyzing the infinite product of a sequence `a_i` and determining its limit. Since the exact sequence `a_i` is not provided, I'll assume a simple example where `a_i = (1 + 1/i^2)` to demonstrate how to approach such problems numerically. The program will compute partial products up to a large `n` to observe convergence.

```python
import math

def compute_product(n):
    product = 1.0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        term = 1 + 1/(i**2)
        product *= term
        # Print intermediate results every 1000 steps
        if i % 1000 == 0:
            print(f"n={i}: {product}")
    return product

# Compute up to n=100000 to observe convergence
final_n = 100000
result = compute_product(final_n)
print(f"Final result at n={final_n}: {result}")
print("Observing convergence to a value around 3.676...")
```

The program computes the partial products of (1 + 1/i²) for i from 1 to n, printing intermediate results every 1000 steps. The final output shows the product converges to approximately 3.676. For the actual problem, you would need to replace the sequence definition with the correct `a_i` from the original problem. The mathematical constant this converges to is known to be sinh(π)/π ≈ 3.67608 when a_i = (1 + 1/i²).
