[write_program]
This problem involves finding a simplified form of the expression `(x + 2*y) - (2*x + y)` under the constraint `x = 2*y` with `y â‰  0`. We'll write a Python program to evaluate this expression for small integer values of y to help identify the pattern.

The program will:
1. Test small non-zero integer values for y (both positive and negative)
2. Calculate x using the constraint x = 2*y
3. Compute the expression (x + 2*y) - (2*x + y)
4. Print the results to observe the pattern

```python
def compute_expression(y):
    x = 2 * y
    return (x + 2 * y) - (2 * x + y)

# Test small non-zero integer values
for y in range(-5, 6):
    if y == 0:
        continue
    result = compute_expression(y)
    print(f"y = {y}, result = {result}")

# The pattern shows the result is always -y
# Therefore, omnimath2849_answer y = -y
```
