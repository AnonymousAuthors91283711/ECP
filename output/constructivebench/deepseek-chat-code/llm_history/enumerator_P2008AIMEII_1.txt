[write_program]
This problem involves summing a series with alternating signs based on modulo 4 conditions. We'll write a Python program to compute this sum and find its last three digits (mod 1000). The series alternates between adding and subtracting squares of numbers from 100 down to 1, with the pattern determined by k mod 4.

```python
def compute_sum():
    total = 0
    for k in range(1, 101):
        term = (101 - k) ** 2
        if k % 4 <= 1:  # k ≡ 0 or 1 mod 4
            total += term
        else:            # k ≡ 2 or 3 mod 4
            total -= term
    return total % 1000

result = compute_sum()
print(result)
```
