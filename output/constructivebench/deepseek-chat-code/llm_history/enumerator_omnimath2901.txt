[write_program]
This problem is about solving for y given the average of x and y is 7, and x is 5. The solution can be found algebraically by solving the equation (5 + y)/2 = 7. We'll write a Python program that verifies this solution numerically.

```python
def solve_for_y():
    x = 5
    avg = 7
    # The equation is (x + y)/2 = avg => y = 2*avg - x
    y = 2 * avg - x
    print(f"Solution: y = {y}")

solve_for_y()
```
