The problem asks for the number of 6×6 binary matrices that can be expressed as the outer product of two binary vectors (one for rows and one for columns). This is equivalent to counting all possible rank-1 binary matrices of size 6×6.

We'll enumerate all possible row vectors (2^6 possibilities) and column vectors (2^6 possibilities), compute their outer products, and count the distinct matrices formed this way. Since some combinations will produce duplicate matrices, we'll need to track uniqueness.

```python
def main():
    n = 6
    seen = set()
    
    # Generate all possible row patterns (2^6 possibilities)
    for r_bits in range(1 << n):
        row = [(r_bits >> i) & 1 for i in range(n)]
        
        # Generate all possible column patterns
        for c_bits in range(1 << n):
            col = [(c_bits >> i) & 1 for i in range(n)]
            
            # Compute outer product matrix as tuple of tuples for hashability
            matrix = tuple(tuple(row[i] & col[j] for j in range(n)) for i in range(n))
            seen.add(matrix)
    
    print(f"Total distinct rank-1 6x6 binary matrices: {len(seen)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
