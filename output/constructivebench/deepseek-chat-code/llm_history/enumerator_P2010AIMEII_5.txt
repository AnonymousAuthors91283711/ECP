This problem involves finding the value of √((log x)² + (log y)² + (log z)²) given certain conditions on positive real numbers x, y, z. We'll approach it by:

1. Making substitutions: Let a = log x, b = log y, c = log z
2. The conditions become:
   - a + b + c = 81 (from xyz = 10^81)
   - a(b + c) + bc = 468
3. We can simplify using a + b + c = 81 ⇒ b + c = 81 - a
4. Substituting gives: a(81 - a) + bc = 468
5. We need to find √(a² + b² + c²)

The program will:
- Iterate through possible integer values for a (since the numbers are nice in competition problems)
- For each a, compute bc = 468 - a(81 - a)
- Check if b and c can be real numbers satisfying b + c = 81 - a and bc = computed value
- Calculate the norm √(a² + b² + c²) when valid

```python
import math

def solve():
    for a in range(-100, 100):  # Reasonable range for competition problem
        sum_bc = 81 - a
        product_bc = 468 - a * (81 - a)
        
        # Check if real roots exist for b and c
        discriminant = sum_bc**2 - 4 * product_bc
        if discriminant >= 0:
            # Calculate the norm
            # a² + b² + c² = a² + (b + c)² - 2bc = a² + sum_bc² - 2*product_bc
            norm_squared = a**2 + sum_bc**2 - 2 * product_bc
            norm = math.sqrt(norm_squared)
            
            # Print all valid cases (though we expect only one nice solution)
            print(f"a={a}, norm={norm}")

    solve()
