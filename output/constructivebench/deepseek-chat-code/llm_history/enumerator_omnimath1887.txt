This problem involves finding natural numbers h, p, z that satisfy two linear equations, and then finding the minimal possible value of h + p + z. We'll solve it by enumerating possible values while respecting the constraints.

The approach:
1. Express variables in terms of one parameter using the equations
2. Iterate through possible values while maintaining natural number constraints
3. Track the minimal sum found

```python
def solve():
    min_sum = float('inf')
    
    # From the first equation: 2h + 3p + 6z = 800
    # From the second equation: 8h + 9p + 12z = 2018
    # We can solve for h and p in terms of z
    
    for z in range(0, 134):  # 6z <= 800 => z <= 133
        # Solve the system for h and p
        # Multiply first equation by 4: 8h + 12p + 24z = 3200
        # Subtract second equation: 3p + 12z = 1182 => p + 4z = 394 => p = 394 - 4z
        p = 394 - 4 * z
        if p < 0:
            continue
            
        # Substitute p back into first equation: 2h + 3(394-4z) + 6z = 800
        # => 2h + 1182 - 12z + 6z = 800
        # => 2h - 6z = -382 => h = 3z - 191
        h = 3 * z - 191
        if h < 0:
            continue
            
        current_sum = h + p + z
        print(f"h={h}, p={p}, z={z}, sum={current_sum}")
        
        if current_sum < min_sum:
            min_sum = current_sum
    
    print(f"Minimal sum: {min_sum}")

solve()
```
