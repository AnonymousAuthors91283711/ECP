[write_program]
This problem appears to be about finding a function `omnimath3149_answer` that takes two pairs of natural numbers and returns a natural number, with a specific example given. Since the exact definition isn't provided, we'll explore possible patterns by enumerating simple operations on the input pairs.

We'll test various operations (addition, multiplication, combinations) on the components of the pairs to see which combination yields 14 for the given inputs (3,1) and (4,2). The program will systematically try different operations and print those that match the example.

```python
def test_operations(a, b, c, d):
    """Test various operations on pairs (a,b) and (c,d) to find combinations that give 14"""
    operations = [
        lambda: a + b + c + d,
        lambda: a * b + c * d,
        lambda: (a + c) * (b + d),
        lambda: a * c + b * d,
        lambda: a * d + b * c,
        lambda: (a + b) * (c + d),
        lambda: a * c * b * d,
        lambda: (a + c) + (b * d),
        lambda: (a * c) + (b + d),
        lambda: (a + d) * (b + c),
        lambda: a * (b + c + d),
        lambda: (a + b + c) * d,
    ]
    
    for i, op in enumerate(operations):
        try:
            res = op()
            if res == 14:
                print(f"Operation {i+1} yields 14: {op.__name__}")
        except:
            continue

# Test with the given example
print("Testing operations for (3,1) and (4,2):")
test_operations(3, 1, 4, 2)
```
