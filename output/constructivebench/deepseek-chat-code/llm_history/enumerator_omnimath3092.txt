This problem asks to find natural numbers t and s that satisfy three equations:
1. 3 + t = 5
2. t + s = 7
3. t + t + t + s + s = omnimath3092_answer (the value we need to find)

We'll solve the equations step by step and compute the final expression.

```python
# Solve the equations:
# 1. 3 + t = 5 ⇒ t = 2
# 2. 2 + s = 7 ⇒ s = 5
# Then compute 3t + 2s = 3*2 + 2*5 = 6 + 10 = 16
print(16)
```
