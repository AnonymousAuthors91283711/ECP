Based on the problem statement and error message, I can see this is a geometry problem involving a triangle with sides 8, 15, 17 (which forms a right triangle since 8² + 15² = 17²). The area is given as 60, and we're asked to find areaABC/4.

The error in the current proposal is due to incorrect formatting of the theorem statement. The correct answer should simply be the value 15 (since 60/4 = 15), but we need to express it properly in Lean.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<15>>> 

Explanation:
1. The triangle ABC is right-angled (8-15-17 Pythagorean triple)
2. Given area is 60 (which matches 0.5*8*15)
3. We need to find area/4 = 60/4 = 15
4. The answer is simply the constant real number 15
5. The error was in the theorem statement formatting, not the value itself[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
