Ground Truth Answer: 2731
Proposed Answer: 3^12 - (3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 + 3^5)
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem involves a triple sum of factorial terms that resembles multinomial coefficients. The ground truth answer is 2731.

The proposed answer is 3^12 - (3^0 + 3^1 + ... + 3^5). Let's calculate this:
3^12 = 531441
Sum of 3^0 to 3^5 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 = 364
So 531441 - 364 = 531077

This is clearly not equal to 2731. The proposed answer is incorrect.

The correct approach would involve recognizing that the sum represents the number of ways to distribute 12 indistinct items into boxes with constraints, but the proposed formula doesn't match this.
