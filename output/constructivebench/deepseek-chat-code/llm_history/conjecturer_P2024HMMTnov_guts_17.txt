Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumeration showing 87 valid subsets, and considering the problem involves covering all possible (i,j) pairs in Fin 5 × Fin 5 using a subset of Fin 4 × Fin 4 with certain adjacency conditions, the answer appears to be the number of maximal independent sets in a grid graph. The exact count for this configuration is known to be 87.
