[write_program]
The problem is to find the value of 9^4 (9 raised to the power of 4). This is a straightforward computation, but we'll write a Python program to calculate it systematically rather than hardcoding the answer.

The approach is simple:
1. Compute 9^4 by multiplying 9 by itself 4 times
2. Print the result

```python
# Compute 9^4 by repeated multiplication
result = 1
for _ in range(4):
    result *= 9
print(result)
```
