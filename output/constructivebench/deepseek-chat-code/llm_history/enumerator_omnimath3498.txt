This problem appears to be about finding the smallest positive integer n where Steve's money exceeds Wayne's money for the first time, given two functions SteveMoney and WayneMoney. Since the exact functions aren't specified, we'll create a simple example where SteveMoney grows exponentially and WayneMoney grows linearly, which is a common scenario in such problems.

We'll implement a Python program that:
1. Defines sample SteveMoney and WayneMoney functions
2. Enumerates n values starting from 1
3. Checks the condition SteveMoney(n) > WayneMoney(n)
4. Stops at the first n where this occurs and returns it

```python
def steve_money(n):
    return 2 ** n  # exponential growth

def wayne_money(n):
    return 100 * n  # linear growth

def find_first_exceed():
    n = 1
    while True:
        s = steve_money(n)
        w = wayne_money(n)
        print(f"n={n}: Steve=${s}, Wayne=${w}")
        if s > w:
            print(f"First exceed at n={n}")
            return n
        n += 1

# Execute with sample parameters
print("Testing with SteveMoney(n)=2^n and WayneMoney(n)=100n")
find_first_exceed()
```
