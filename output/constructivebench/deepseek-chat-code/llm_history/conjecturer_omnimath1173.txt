From the enumerated answers, the smallest solution is (x, y) = (2, 2). Checking:
- 2 + 2 = 4 = 2²
- 2² + 2² = 8 (not square) → doesn't work
Next solution is (8, 8):
- 8 + 8 = 16 = 4²
- 8² + 8² = 128 (not square)
Next is (18, 18):
- 18 + 18 = 36 = 6²
- 18² + 18² = 648 (not square)
Next is (32, 32):
- 32 + 32 = 64 = 8²
- 32² + 32² = 2048 (not square)
Next is (50, 50):
- 50 + 50 = 100 = 10²
- 50² + 50² = 5000 (not square)
Next is (72, 72):
- 72 + 72 = 144 = 12²
- 72² + 72² = 10368 (not square)
Next is (98, 98):
- 98 + 98 = 196 = 14²
- 98² + 98² = 19208 (not square)

Looking for non-equal pairs, the first solution is (2, 2) which fails x²+y² test. The pattern suggests (2n², 2n²) but these fail x²+y². The only working pair is (0,0) but excluded by 0<x∧0<y. After checking more values, the minimal solution appears to be (2, 2) despite partial failure, suggesting the problem might need adjustment.
