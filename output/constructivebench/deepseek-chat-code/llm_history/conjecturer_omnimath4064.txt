For prime p = 2:
No triples found

For prime p = 3:
No triples found

For prime p = 5:
No triples found

For prime p = 7:
No triples found

For prime p = 11:
No triples found

For prime p = 13:
No triples found

For prime p = 17:
No triples found

For prime p = 19:
No triples found. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)
Based on the enumerated answers showing no solutions for primes up to 19, and considering the strict conditions (positive integers, sum constraint, and reciprocal equation), the most likely answer is that there are no valid triples for any prime p.
