This problem asks for the maximum value of the function y = sin(arctan(x/9) - arctan(x/16)) for x > 0. To find this, we'll:

1. Use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression
2. Find the critical points by taking the derivative
3. Evaluate the function at critical points and boundaries

The key simplification comes from the arctangent subtraction formula: arctan(a) - arctan(b) = arctan((a-b)/(1+ab)) when ab > -1. Then we can use sin(arctan(z)) = z/√(1+z²).

```python
import math

def compute_y(x):
    # Using the identity: sin(arctan(A) - arctan(B)) = (A - B)/sqrt((1 + A^2)(1 + B^2))
    A = x / 9
    B = x / 16
    numerator = A - B
    denominator = math.sqrt((1 + A**2) * (1 + B**2))
    return numerator / denominator

# Search for maximum by evaluating at critical points and checking behavior
def find_max():
    # The maximum occurs at x where derivative is zero
    # After simplification, this is when x^2 = 9*16 => x = 12
    critical_x = 12.0
    y_at_critical = compute_y(critical_x)
    
    # Also check behavior as x approaches 0 and infinity
    y_at_small = compute_y(0.0001)
    y_at_large = compute_y(1000000)
    
    print(f"y at x≈0: {y_at_small}")
    print(f"y at x=12: {y_at_critical}")
    print(f"y at x→∞: {y_at_large}")
    
    # The maximum is clearly at x=12
    print(f"\nMaximum value is: {y_at_critical}")

find_max()
```
