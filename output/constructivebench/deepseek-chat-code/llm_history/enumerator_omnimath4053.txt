[write_program]
This problem involves finding all integer-coefficient polynomials P such that for every natural number n > 0 with more than 2023^2023 distinct prime factors, P(n) is positive and has no more distinct prime factors than n itself. The solution likely involves constant polynomials and polynomials of the form Â±X^k.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate small-degree polynomials and check the condition for small values of n with multiple prime factors. We'll focus on polynomials up to degree 3 with small coefficients.

```python
def is_positive_and_prime_factors_condition(P, n):
    """Check if P(n) > 0 and has no more distinct prime factors than n."""
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    # Evaluate polynomial at n
    value = sum(c * (n**i) for i, c in enumerate(P))
    if value <= 0:
        return False
    
    # Count distinct prime factors of n
    def count_prime_factors(x):
        if x == 1:
            return 0
        count = 0
        p = 2
        while p * p <= x:
            if x % p == 0:
                count += 1
                while x % p == 0:
                    x //= p
            p += 1
        if x > 1:
            count += 1
        return count
    
    n_factors = count_prime_factors(n)
    value_factors = count_prime_factors(abs(value))
    return value_factors <= n_factors

    for n in test_numbers:
        if not is_positive_and_prime_factors_condition(P, n):
            return False
    return True

def enumerate_polynomials(max_degree=2, max_coeff=2):
    """Enumerate polynomials with small coefficients and degree."""
    from itertools import product
    
    for degree in range(max_degree + 1):

                continue
            P = coeffs
            if test_polynomial(P):
                print(f"Found valid polynomial: {P}")
