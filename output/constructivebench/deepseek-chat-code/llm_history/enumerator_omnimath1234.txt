The problem asks to compute the base-2 logarithm of the sum of even binomial coefficients for (2009 choose k) where k ranges from 0 to 2008. We need to find an exact value for this logarithm.

The key observation is that the sum of even binomial coefficients for (n choose k) is equal to 2^(n-1). This can be seen by considering the binomial expansion of (1+1)^n and (1-1)^n and adding them together. For n=2009, the sum S would be 2^2008. Therefore, logâ‚‚(S) = 2008.

We'll write a Python program that verifies this pattern for smaller values of n to build confidence in the general solution.

```python
from math import log2, comb

def compute_log_sum_even_binomials(n):
    """Compute log2 of sum of even binomial coefficients (n choose k) for k from 0 to n-1"""
    S = sum(comb(n, k) for k in range(n) if k % 2 == 0)
    return log2(S)

# Test the pattern for small values of n
for n in range(1, 21):
    result = compute_log_sum_even_binomials(n)
    print(f"n={n}: log2(S) = {result} (expected {n-1})")

# For the actual problem (n=2009)
print("\nFor n=2009:")
print(f"log2(S) = {2009-1} (expected value based on pattern)")
```
