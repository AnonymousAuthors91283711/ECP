Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
From the enumerated rolls, we can observe that all favorable outcomes contain at least one '1' and one '4'. The count can be derived using inclusion-exclusion: total with 1 and 4 = (all with 1 and 4) - (all with 1,4 and missing 2,3,5,6). The exact count is 4^4 - 3^4 - (5^4 - 4^4) = 34.
