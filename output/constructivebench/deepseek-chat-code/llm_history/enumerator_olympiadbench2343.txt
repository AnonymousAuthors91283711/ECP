[write_program]
This problem asks to find the unique integer k between 2 and 40 such that k(k-1)/(40*39) = 5/12. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible k values in this range and check the condition.

The approach:
1. Iterate k from 2 to 40
2. For each k, compute both sides of the equation
3. Check if they are equal (using exact integer arithmetic to avoid floating point errors)
4. Print any k that satisfies the equation

```python
def find_k():
    for k in range(2, 41):
        # Compute numerator and denominator to avoid floating point
        lhs_num = k * (k - 1) * 12
        lhs_den = 40 * 39 * 5
        # Check if cross products are equal
        if lhs_num == lhs_den:
            print(f"Found solution: k = {k}")
            return  # Since problem states unique solution
    print("No solution found")

find_k()
```
