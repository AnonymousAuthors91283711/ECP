Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => (2 * x + 3 * y) / (3 * x - 2 * y)
Proposed Answer: fun x y : ℝ => (3 * x - 2 * y) / (x + y)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us the equation (x-y)/(x+y) = 5 and asks us to find some relationship between x and y.

2. The ground truth answer is (2x + 3y)/(3x - 2y), which is indeed equal to 0 when we solve the original equation (as we can derive x = -3y/2).

3. The proposed answer is (3x - 2y)/(x + y), which is different from the ground truth.

4. If we substitute x = -3y/2 (from solving the original equation) into both:
   - Ground truth becomes 0 (as required)
   - Proposed answer becomes (-9y/2 - 2y)/(-3y/2 + y) = (-13y/2)/(-y/2) = 13 ≠ 0

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the theorem's requirement that it equals 0 under the given conditions.
