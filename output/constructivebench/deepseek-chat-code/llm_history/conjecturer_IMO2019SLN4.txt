abbrev IMO2019SLN4_answer : ℕ → Set (ℕ → ℕ) := sorry
theorem IMO2019SLN4 (C : ℕ) (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ a b : ℕ, a + b > C → (a + f b) ∣ (a^2 + b * f a)) ↔ f ∈ IMO2019SLN4_answer C := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 
Testing C = 0
Found candidate: f(k) = k + 0

Testing C = 1
Found candidate: f(k) = k + 0

Testing C = 2
Found candidate: f(k) = k + 0

Testing C = 3
Found candidate: f(k) = k + 0
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → Set (ℕ → ℕ)
<<<fun C : ℕ => {f | ∀ k, f k = k}>>>
