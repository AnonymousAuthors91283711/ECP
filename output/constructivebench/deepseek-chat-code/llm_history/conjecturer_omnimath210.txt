Testing piecewise solutions:. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Based on the problem statement and the enumerated solution, the simplest function that satisfies the given condition is the identity function f(n) = n. The condition holds since f^[f n] n = f^[n] n = n = n²/n = n²/(f(f n)). Therefore, the answer set should contain 1000.
