[write_program]
The problem asks for the count of integers `b` (where `1 < b`) such that `b^1 ≤ 41` and `41 < b^2`. This translates to finding all integers `b` where `b` is between `sqrt(41)` and `41` (exclusive and inclusive respectively). 

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible values of `b` that satisfy these conditions and count them. The key steps are:
1. Iterate through possible values of `b` from 2 to 41.
2. Check if `b` satisfies `b ≤ 41` and `41 < b^2`.
3. Count and print all valid `b` values.

```python
def solve():
    count = 0
    for b in range(2, 42):  # 2 to 41 inclusive
        if b <= 41 and 41 < b * b:
            print(f"Valid b: {b}")
            count += 1
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

solve()
```
