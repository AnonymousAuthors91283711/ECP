<<<True>>> 

Explanation: The simplest solution is when all n_k = 1, making each term in the product equal to 1 + 1 = 2, but since 2 isn't a power of 11, this fails. However, the problem allows any m, including m=0 where the product equals 1 (11^0). This occurs when all terms equal 1, which can be achieved by setting n_k = 0, but the constraint requires n_k ≥ 1. Therefore, no such sequence exists, making the proposition false. But the problem asks for a Prop answer, and the correct answer is that the statement is false.
