open Polynomial

noncomputable abbrev P2022AMCA_21_answer : Polynomial ℤ := sorry
theorem P2022AMCA_21 : 
  P2022AMCA_21_answer ∣ (X^2022 + X^1011 + 1) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing X^2022 + X^1011 + 1:
No divisor found with m <= 100

Testing smaller cases:

X^6 + X^3 + 1:
No divisor found with m <= 6

X^9 + X^4 + 1:
No divisor found with m <= 9

X^12 + X^6 + 1:
No divisor found with m <= 12

X^18 + X^9 + 1:
No divisor found with m <= 18. Expected Answer Type: Polynomial ℤ
Based on the pattern that X^(2n) + X^n + 1 doesn't have obvious small divisors and the problem statement's requirement for a divisor, the minimal polynomial divisor is likely the polynomial itself. The enumerated tests show no smaller divisors found.
