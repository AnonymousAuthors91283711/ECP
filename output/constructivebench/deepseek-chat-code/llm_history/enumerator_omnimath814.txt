This problem involves calculating the ratio A/B where A and B are products of four terms each, with each term being a linear combination of square roots. To approach this, we'll:

1. Compute the exact value of A and B symbolically by expanding the products
2. Simplify the ratio A/B to find a pattern or exact value
3. Since exact symbolic computation is complex, we'll compute numerical approximations first to identify a pattern

The key observation is that both A and B are products of similar terms, just with coefficients permuted. We'll compute the ratio numerically to see if it simplifies to a simple rational number or recognizable irrational.

```python
import math

def compute_A():
    sqrt2 = math.sqrt(2)
    sqrt3 = math.sqrt(3)
    sqrt6 = math.sqrt(6)
    term1 = (1 + 2*sqrt2 + 3*sqrt3 + 6*sqrt6)
    term2 = (2 + 6*sqrt2 + sqrt3 + 3*sqrt6)
    term3 = (3 + sqrt2 + 6*sqrt3 + 2*sqrt6)
    term4 = (6 + 3*sqrt2 + 2*sqrt3 + sqrt6)
    return term1 * term2 * term3 * term4

def compute_B():
    sqrt2 = math.sqrt(2)
    sqrt3 = math.sqrt(3)
    sqrt6 = math.sqrt(6)
    term1 = (1 + 3*sqrt2 + 2*sqrt3 + 6*sqrt6)
    term2 = (2 + sqrt2 + 6*sqrt3 + 3*sqrt6)
    term3 = (3 + 6*sqrt2 + sqrt3 + 2*sqrt6)
    term4 = (6 + 2*sqrt2 + 3*sqrt3 + sqrt6)
    return term1 * term2 * term3 * term4

A = compute_A()
B = compute_B()
ratio = A / B

# Print with high precision
print(f"A ≈ {A:.15f}")
print(f"B ≈ {B:.15f}")
print(f"A/B ≈ {ratio:.15f}")

# Check if ratio is close to a simple fraction
from fractions import Fraction
for denom in range(1, 100):
    numer = round(ratio * denom)
    approx = Fraction(numer, denom)
    if abs(ratio - approx.numerator/approx.denominator) < 1e-10:
        print(f"Possible exact ratio: {approx}")
        break
```
