[write_program]
This problem involves solving for the ratio a/b given the equation (a + b)/(a - b) = 3. We'll write a Python program to explore possible rational solutions for a and b that satisfy these conditions.

The approach is:
1. Iterate through possible integer values for b (avoiding 0)
2. For each b, compute possible a values that satisfy the equation
3. Check if a â‰  b and the equation holds
4. Calculate and print the ratio a/b for valid pairs

```python
def solve_ratio():
    # Iterate through possible integer values of b from -10 to 10 (excluding 0)
    for b in range(-10, 11):
        if b == 0:
            continue  # skip b=0 to avoid division by zero
        # For each b, try possible integer a values around b
        for a in range(b-20, b+21):
            if a == b:
                continue  # skip a=b as per condition
            # Check if (a + b)/(a - b) equals 3 (within floating point tolerance)
            if abs((a + b)/(a - b) - 3) < 1e-9:
                ratio = a / b
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, ratio={ratio}")

    # Also check some non-integer cases
    for b in [0.5, 1.5, 2.5, -0.5, -1.5]:
        for a in [b-2, b-1, b+1, b+2]:
            if a == b:
                continue
            if abs((a + b)/(a - b) - 3) < 1e-9:
                ratio = a / b
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, ratio={ratio}")
