This problem is about finding the minimal number of pairs (p,q) in a 10x10 grid such that every pair of indices (i,j) is covered by at least one (p,q) pair's neighborhood (including p,p+1 and q,q+1). The goal is to find the largest minimal set size where removing any element breaks the coverage property.

We'll approach this by:
1. Modeling the grid coverage condition
2. Enumerating possible sets of points
3. Checking minimal coverage
4. Finding the maximal minimal set size

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_covered(i, j, C):
    for p, q in C:
        if (i == p or i == p + 1) and (j == q or j == q + 1):
            return True
    return False

def is_valid(C):
    for i in range(10):
        for j in range(10):
            if not is_covered(i, j, C):
                return False
    return True

def is_minimal(C):
    if not is_valid(C):
        return False
    for point in C:
        C_reduced = set(C) - {point}
        if is_valid(C_reduced):
            return False
    return True

def find_max_minimal():
    max_size = 0
    # We'll check sizes from 25 down to find the maximal minimal set
    for size in range(25, 0, -1):
        found = False
        # Sample points in a checkerboard pattern first
        sample_points = [(i,j) for i in range(9) for j in range(9) if (i+j)%2 == 0]
        # Try combinations of this size
        for C in combinations(sample_points, size):
            if is_minimal(C):
                print(f"Found minimal set of size {size}: {C}")
                max_size = size
                found = True
                break
        if found:
            break
    return max_size

print("Searching for maximal minimal set size...")
result = find_max_minimal()
print(f"The maximal minimal set size is: {result}")
```

Note: The actual implementation would need to be more efficient for larger sizes, but this demonstrates the approach. The checkerboard pattern is a good starting point since it provides maximal coverage with minimal overlap. The program searches from larger sizes downward to find the maximal minimal set efficiently.
