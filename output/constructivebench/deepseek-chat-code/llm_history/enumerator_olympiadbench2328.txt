This problem involves finding the value(s) of d such that the ratio of terms in a geometric sequence equals the ratio of terms in an arithmetic sequence. We'll enumerate possible values of d by computing both ratios and checking for equality.

The geometric sequence is defined by g₀=10 and gₙ₊₁ = (1/2)gₙ, so gₙ = 10*(1/2)ⁿ.
The arithmetic sequence is defined by a₀=10 and aₙ₊₁ = aₙ + d, so aₙ = 10 + n*d.

We need to find d such that g₆/g₄ = a₆/a₄.

```python
def geometric(n):
    return 10 * (0.5)**n

def arithmetic(n, d):
    return 10 + n * d

# Compute the required geometric ratio
geo_ratio = geometric(6) / geometric(4)

# Search for d values that make the arithmetic ratio equal to geo_ratio
# We'll search around reasonable values since d=0 is trivial and invalid (a₄=0)
for d in [x/100 for x in range(-1000, 1001)]:
    a4 = arithmetic(4, d)
    if abs(a4) < 1e-9:  # avoid division by zero
        continue
    a6 = arithmetic(6, d)
    arith_ratio = a6 / a4
    if abs(arith_ratio - geo_ratio) < 1e-6:  # allow small floating point error
        print(f"Found d = {d:.2f}")

# For exact value, we can solve symbolically:
# geo_ratio = (1/2)^2 = 1/4
# a6/a4 = (10 + 6d)/(10 + 4d) = 1/4
# => 4(10 + 6d) = 10 + 4d
# => 40 + 24d = 10 + 4d
# => 30 + 20d = 0
# => d = -1.5
print("\nExact solution should be d = -1.5")
```
