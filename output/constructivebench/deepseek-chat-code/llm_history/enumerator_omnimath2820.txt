The problem involves finding all 5-digit numbers formed by doubling a 4-digit number (with distinct digits) such that the resulting digits match a specific pattern. We need to count how many such numbers exist.

Here's a Python program to enumerate and count valid solutions:

```python
from itertools import permutations

def solve():
    count = 0
    # Iterate through all 4-digit numbers with distinct digits (wxyz)
    for digits in permutations(range(10), 4):
        w, x, y, z = digits
        if w == 0:  # must be 4-digit number
            continue
        
        n = 1000 * w + 100 * x + 10 * y + z
        sum_n = n * 2
        if sum_n < 10000 or sum_n >= 100000:  # must be 5-digit
            continue
        
        # Extract digits of the sum (abcde)
        a = (sum_n // 10000) % 10
        b = (sum_n // 1000) % 10
        c = (sum_n // 100) % 10
        d = (sum_n // 10) % 10
        e = sum_n % 10
        
        # Check the pattern [b, c, d, e] == [w, u, y, v]
        # We need to find u and v from remaining digits (0-9 excluding w,x,y,z)
        remaining_digits = [d for d in range(10) if d not in {w, x, y, z}]
        
        # u must be c, v must be e
        u = c
        v = e
        
        # Check all conditions:
        # 1. u and v must be from remaining digits
        if u not in remaining_digits or v not in remaining_digits:
            continue
        
        # 2. All digits must be distinct (already handled by permutations)
        # 3. Check the digit pattern
        if b == w and d == y:
            print(f"Found solution: n={n}, sum={sum_n}, u={u}, v={v}")
            count += 1
    
    print(f"Total solutions: {count}")

solve()
```

The program:
1. Generates all 4-digit numbers with distinct digits (wxyz)
2. Doubles each number and checks if it's a 5-digit number
3. Verifies the digit pattern [w, u, y, v] in the sum
4. Ensures u and v are distinct from w,x,y,z and each other
5. Counts and prints all valid solutions

The output will show each valid solution as it's found and the total count at the end.
