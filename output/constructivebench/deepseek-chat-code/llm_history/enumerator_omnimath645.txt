This problem involves calculating a probability ratio between two combinatorial expressions. The task is to compute the exact value of `valid/total` where:
- `total` counts the number of ways to partition 8 people into 4 teams of 2
- `valid` counts the number of valid partitions where two specific people are in the same team

Here's a Python program that calculates these combinatorial values and computes the exact ratio:

```python
from math import comb
from fractions import Fraction

def calculate_total():
    # Total ways to partition 8 people into 4 teams of 2
    # Formula: C(8,2)*C(6,2)*C(4,2)*C(2,2) / 4! (to account for team order)
    numerator = comb(8, 2) * comb(6, 2) * comb(4, 2) * comb(2, 2)
    return numerator // 24  # 4! = 24

def calculate_valid():
    # Valid partitions where two specific people are together
    # First pair them together (C(6,0)), then partition remaining 6 into 3 teams
    # Formula: C(6,2)*C(4,2)*C(2,2) / 3! * C(4,2)*C(2,2)/2! (for the other side)
    # Simplified to: C(6,2)*C(4,2)/2 * C(4,2)/2
    part1 = comb(6, 2) * comb(4, 2) // 2
    part2 = comb(4, 2) // 2
    return part1 * part2

total = calculate_total()
valid = calculate_valid()
probability = Fraction(valid, total)

print(f"Total partitions: {total}")
print(f"Valid partitions: {valid}")
print(f"Exact probability: {probability}")
```
