Ground Truth Answer: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6}
Proposed Answer: {n : ℤ | n ∈ ({0, 1, 3, 4, 6} : Set ℤ)}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both are expressing the same set of integers {0, 1, 3, 4, 6}, just using slightly different notation. The proposed answer uses set builder notation to specify that n must be an element of {0, 1, 3, 4, 6}, which is identical to simply listing the elements as in the ground truth answer.
