abbrev omnimath2869_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2869 (x y : ℕ) (hx : 0 < x) (hy : 0 < y) 
  (h1 : 10 * x + y = 75) (h2 : 10 * y + x = 57) : 
  x + y = omnimath2869_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for (x,y) pairs that satisfy:
10x + y = 75
10y + x = 57

Found solution: x=7, y=5
x + y = 12. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<12>>>
