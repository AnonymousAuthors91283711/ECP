[write_program]
This problem involves simplifying a nested square root expression. The goal is to find a simplified form of √(13 + √(7 + √4)). Since √4 is 2, we can simplify the expression step by step.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Simplify the innermost square root (√4 = 2)
2. Compute the next level (7 + 2 = 9, √9 = 3)
3. Compute the outermost level (13 + 3 = 16, √16 = 4)
4. Verify if the simplified form matches any simple integer

The program will show each step of the simplification process.

```python
import math

def simplify_nested_sqrt():
    # Step 1: Innermost square root (√4)
    inner = math.sqrt(4)
    print(f"√4 = {inner}")
    
    # Step 2: Next level (7 + √4) and its square root
    middle = 7 + inner
    middle_sqrt = math.sqrt(middle)
    print(f"√(7 + √4) = √{middle} = {middle_sqrt}")
    
    # Step 3: Outermost level (13 + previous result) and its square root
    outer = 13 + middle_sqrt
    outer_sqrt = math.sqrt(outer)
    print(f"√(13 + √(7 + √4)) = √{outer} = {outer_sqrt}")
    
    # Final simplified form
    print(f"Simplified form: {outer_sqrt}")

simplify_nested_sqrt()
