[write_program]
This problem asks to find all real numbers x where x/2 < x² and x² < x. We'll write a Python program to enumerate rational candidates and identify the intervals where these inequalities hold.

The inequalities can be rewritten as:
1. x/2 < x² → x² - x/2 > 0 → x(x - 1/2) > 0
2. x² < x → x² - x < 0 → x(x - 1) < 0

We'll analyze these inequalities and verify the solution by testing sample points.

```python
def check_condition(x):
    return (x/2 < x*x) and (x*x < x)

# Test points around critical values (0, 0.5, 1)
test_points = [-1, -0.1, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.1, 2]

print("Testing points around critical values:")
for x in test_points:
    result = check_condition(x)
    print(f"x = {x:.2f}: {'Satisfies' if result else 'Does not satisfy'} the condition")

# Enumerate rational numbers in (0.5, 1) to show examples
print("\nSample rational numbers in solution set:")
for numerator in range(1, 20):
    x = numerator / 20
    if 0.5 < x < 1 and check_condition(x):
        print(f"{numerator}/20 = {x:.2f} satisfies the condition")

# Output the solution interval
print("\nThe solution set appears to be all real numbers x where 0.5 < x < 1")
```
