The problem asks for a unique positive real number \( x \) that satisfies two conditions: \( \cos(\arctan x) = x \) and \( x^2 \) equals some value (denoted as `omnimath1366_answer`). 

To find this \( x \), we can:
1. Recognize that \( \cos(\arctan x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} \), so the equation becomes \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} = x \).
2. Square both sides to get \( \frac{1}{1 + x^2} = x^2 \), which simplifies to \( x^4 + x^2 - 1 = 0 \).
3. Solve this quartic equation for \( x \). Let \( y = x^2 \), then \( y^2 + y - 1 = 0 \), which has a positive solution \( y = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).
4. Thus, \( x = \sqrt{\frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}} \), and \( x^2 = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

The Python program will verify this by checking the equation numerically and printing the solution.

```python
import math

def find_x():
    # Solve x^4 + x^2 - 1 = 0 for x > 0
    # Let y = x^2, then y^2 + y - 1 = 0
    sqrt5 = math.sqrt(5)
    y = (-1 + sqrt5) / 2  # Positive solution for y
    x = math.sqrt(y)
    # Verify cos(arctan(x)) = x
    lhs = math.cos(math.atan(x))
    print(f"x = {x}")
    print(f"cos(arctan(x)) = {lhs}")
    print(f"x^2 = {y}")

find_x()
