Ground Truth Answer: 187465 / 6744582
Proposed Answer: 1 / 37
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves a system of equations where we have 5 variables (a₀ to a₄) and 5 equations (for k=1 to 5). The equations relate sums of rational functions to 1/k².

2. The ground truth answer (187465/6744582) is a specific rational number that results from solving this system of equations and evaluating the final sum at 37.

3. The proposed answer (1/37) is much simpler and doesn't appear to account for the complexity of the system of equations. It seems to be suggesting that each aᵢ = 1, which would not satisfy the given conditions for k=1 to 5.

4. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth answer numerically (1/37 ≈ 0.027 while 187465/6744582 ≈ 0.0278), and there's no mathematical justification provided for why it would simplify to 1/37.
