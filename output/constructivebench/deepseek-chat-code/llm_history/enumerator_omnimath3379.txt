This problem involves finding the probability of being at vertex 0 after 5 steps in a specific Markov chain. The chain has 6 vertices (0-5) with equal initial probabilities (1/6 each). The transition matrix T is defined such that:
- Diagonal entries are 0 (no self-loops)
- For specific edges (listed in the problem), the transition probability is 1/4
- All other transitions are 0

We'll enumerate the possible paths by implementing the Markov chain and computing T^5 * p.

```python
import numpy as np

def main():
    # Define the transition matrix
    T = np.zeros((6, 6))
    edges = [(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,5), 
             (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
    
    # Build symmetric transition matrix
    for i in range(6):
        for j in range(6):
            if i == j:
                T[i,j] = 0
            elif (i,j) in edges or (j,i) in edges:
                T[i,j] = 1/4
    
    # Normalize rows (each row should sum to 1)
    for i in range(6):
        row_sum = sum(T[i])
        if row_sum > 0:
            T[i] /= row_sum
    
    # Initial probability vector
    p = np.array([1/6]*6)
    
    # Compute T^5 * p
    T_power = np.linalg.matrix_power(T, 5)
    result = T_power @ p
    
    # Print the probability for vertex 0
    print(f"Probability at vertex 0 after 5 steps: {result[0]}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
