No valid cover found. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<24>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks for minimal N such that all pairs (x,y) with x≤20, y≤23 can be uniquely identified by some strategy. The enumerated pattern suggests N=24, likely because it's the maximum y value plus 1 (23+1), which would allow each strategy to cover a distinct y-coordinate.
