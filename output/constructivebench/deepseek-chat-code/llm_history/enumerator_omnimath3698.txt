[write_program]
This problem asks to find all natural number triples (x,y,z) that satisfy the equation 2013^x + 2014^y = 2015^z. We'll write a Python program to search for solutions by checking small exponents, since the numbers grow rapidly.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible exponents x, y, z up to a reasonable limit
2. For each combination, compute both sides of the equation
3. Print any matches found
4. Since we're dealing with large numbers, we'll use Python's arbitrary precision integers

```python
def solve_equation():
    max_exp = 20  # Reasonable upper bound for exponents
    print(f"Searching for solutions to 2013^x + 2014^y = 2015^z with x,y,z <= {max_exp}")
    
    found = False
    for x in range(0, max_exp + 1):
        a = 2013 ** x
        for y in range(0, max_exp + 1):
            b = 2014 ** y
            left = a + b
            for z in range(0, max_exp + 1):
                right = 2015 ** z
                if left == right:
                    print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")
                    found = True
                elif left < right:
                    break  # Early termination for this y since right grows with z
    
    if not found:
        print("No solutions found in the search range")
