[write_program]
The problem involves finding the product of the roots of a quadratic equation formed by expanding and simplifying the given polynomial expression. We'll write a Python program to compute the roots and their product.

Key steps:
1. Expand the polynomial expression (x-4)(x-2) + (x-2)(x-6)
2. Find the roots of the resulting quadratic equation
3. Calculate the product of these roots

The program will compute this directly without hardcoding the answer.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, expand

def solve_problem():
    x = symbols('x')
    # Define the polynomial expression
    expr = (x - 4)*(x - 2) + (x - 2)*(x - 6)
    # Expand the expression
    expanded = expand(expr)
    # Find roots
    roots = solve(Eq(expanded, 0), x)
    # Calculate product of roots
    product = roots[0] * roots[1] if len(roots) == 2 else None
    
    print(f"Expanded polynomial: {expanded}")
    print(f"Roots: {roots}")
    print(f"Product of roots: {product}")

solve_problem()
```
