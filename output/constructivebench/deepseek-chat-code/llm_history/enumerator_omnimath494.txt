This problem asks for the number of ordered quadruples (x1,y1,x2,y2) where:
- x1 ∈ {0,1,2,3,4} (Fin 5)
- y1 ∈ {0,1,2,3,4,5} (Fin 6)
- x2 ∈ {0,1,2,3,4} (Fin 5)
- y2 ∈ {0,1,2,3,4,5} (Fin 6)
with the constraints x1 < x2 and y1 < y2.

We'll enumerate all possible valid combinations by iterating through all possible pairs and counting those that satisfy the conditions.

```python
def count_valid_quadruples():
    count = 0
    for x1 in range(5):
        for y1 in range(6):
            for x2 in range(5):
                for y2 in range(6):
                    if x1 < x2 and y1 < y2:
                        count += 1
                        # Print each valid quadruple found
                        print(f"Found valid quadruple: ({x1},{y1},{x2},{y2})")
    # After enumeration, print the total count
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

count_valid_quadruples()
```

The program will:
1. Iterate through all possible combinations of x1,y1,x2,y2
2. Check if x1 < x2 and y1 < y2
3. Print each valid combination as it's found
4. Finally print the total count of valid combinations

The output will show all 150 valid combinations (which is the correct answer) in the format:
Found valid quadruple: (x1,y1,x2,y2)
...
Total count: 150
