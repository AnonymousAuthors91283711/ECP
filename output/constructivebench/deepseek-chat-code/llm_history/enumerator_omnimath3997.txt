This problem involves finding the difference between two sums of squares when given a specific condition. Let's analyze it mathematically first to guide our enumeration approach.

Given:
1. ∑(x_i)^2 = ∑(x_i + 1)^2 for i=1 to 100
2. We need to find ∑(x_i + 2)^2 - ∑(x_i)^2

First, expand the given condition:
∑(x_i + 1)^2 = ∑(x_i^2 + 2x_i + 1) = ∑x_i^2 + 2∑x_i + 100

Set equal to ∑x_i^2:
∑x_i^2 = ∑x_i^2 + 2∑x_i + 100 ⇒ 0 = 2∑x_i + 100 ⇒ ∑x_i = -50

Now compute the target difference:
∑(x_i + 2)^2 - ∑x_i^2 = ∑(x_i^2 + 4x_i + 4) - ∑x_i^2 = 4∑x_i + 400 = 4*(-50) + 400 = 200

Thus the answer is always 200 regardless of the specific x_i values, as long as they satisfy ∑x_i = -50. We'll verify this with small examples.

```python
def verify(n=100):
    # For n numbers, the difference should be 4n when sum is -n/2
    # Let's test with small n values
    for n in [2, 4, 10, 100]:
        # Create numbers where sum is -n/2 (simplest case: all equal)
        x = [-0.5] * n
        sum_x = sum(x)
        sum_x_sq = sum(xi**2 for xi in x)
        sum_x_plus_1_sq = sum((xi+1)**2 for xi in x)
        sum_x_plus_2_sq = sum((xi+2)**2 for xi in x)
        
        # Verify condition holds
        if abs(sum_x_sq - sum_x_plus_1_sq) > 1e-9:
            print(f"Condition failed for n={n}")
            continue
            
        # Compute difference
        diff = sum_x_plus_2_sq - sum_x_sq
        print(f"n={n}: difference = {diff}")

verify()
```
