Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the enumerated solutions, the number 22 appears in every solution as one of the first three numbers (positions 0-2). Since the average condition requires all triplets to have the same sum, and 22 is consistently part of the first triplet, it's likely the answer we're looking for.
