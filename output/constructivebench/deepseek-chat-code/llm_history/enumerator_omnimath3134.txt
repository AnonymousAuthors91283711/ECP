[write_program]
This problem involves finding the value of S - P given recursive relationships between points P, Q, R, S. We'll write a Python program to compute S - P symbolically based on the given conditions.

The approach is:
1. Express all points in terms of P
2. Compute each subsequent point using the given differences
3. Calculate S - P symbolically

```python
def compute_S_minus_P():
    # Let P be our base variable (can be 0 without loss of generality)
    P = 0
    
    # Q - P = 1
    Q = P + 1
    
    # R - Q = 2*(Q - P) = 2*1 = 2
    R = Q + 2
    
    # S - R = 3*(R - Q) = 3*2 = 6
    S = R + 6
    
    # Compute S - P
    S_minus_P = S - P
    
    print(f"S - P = {S_minus_P}")

compute_S_minus_P()
```
