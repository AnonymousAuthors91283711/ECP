[write_program]
The problem asks to count the number of quadratic polynomials p(x) with real coefficients where:
1. The degree is exactly 2
2. The polynomial has two real roots r and s (possibly equal)
3. The set of coefficients {a₂, a₁, a₀} equals the set of roots {r, s}

We'll enumerate all possible cases by considering the relationships between coefficients and roots.

```python
from itertools import product

def solve():
    count = 0
    # We'll represent the polynomial as p(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c
    # The roots r and s must satisfy:
    # {a, b, c} = {r, s} (as sets)
    # Also, p must be quadratic (a ≠ 0) and have real roots
    
    # Case 1: All coefficients are equal (a = b = c = k)
    # Then roots must be {k}, but p(x) = kx^2 + kx + k
    # Roots: x^2 + x + 1 = 0 → no real roots → invalid
    
    # Case 2: Two coefficients equal one value, one different
    # Subcases: (a=b)≠c, (a=c)≠b, (b=c)≠a
    
    # Subcase 2.1: a = b ≠ c
    # Then roots must be {a, c}
    # By Vieta: sum r+s = -b/a = -1, product rs = c/a
    # Since roots are {a, c}, we have:
    # a + c = -1 and a*c = c/a
    # From a*c = c/a: c(a - 1/a) = 0 → c=0 or a=±1
    for a in [-1, 1]:
        c = -1 - a
        if a != c:  # since a = b ≠ c
            # Check discriminant: b²-4ac = a²-4ac ≥ 0
            if a*a - 4*a*c >= 0:
                count += 1
                print(f"Found: p(x) = {a}x^2 + {a}x + {c}")
    # c=0 case:
    a = -1  # from a + 0 = -1
    c = 0
    if a != 0:
        if a*a - 4*a*c >= 0:
            count += 1
            print(f"Found: p(x) = {a}x^2 + {a}x + {c}")
    
    # Subcase 2.2: a = c ≠ b
    # Roots must be {a, b}
    # Vieta: a + b = -b/a, a*b = c/a = 1
    # From a*b = 1 → b = 1/a
    # Substitute into sum: a + 1/a = -1/a → a^2 + 2 = 0 → no real solutions
    
    # Subcase 2.3: b = c ≠ a
    # Roots must be {a, b}
    # Vieta: a + b = -b/a, a*b = c/a = b/a → a^2*b = b → b=0 or a^2=1
    # b=0 case:
    a = 0  # but a≠0 for quadratic → invalid
    # a^2=1 → a=±1
    for a in [-1, 1]:
        # From a + b = -b/a → b = -a^2/(a+1)
        b = -a*a/(a + 1)
        c = b
        if a != b:
            # Check discriminant: b²-4ac ≥ 0
            if b*b - 4*a*c >= 0:
                count += 1
                print(f"Found: p(x) = {a}x^2 + {b}x + {c}")
    
    # Case 3: All coefficients distinct - not possible since we need {a,b,c}={r,s} with only 2 roots
    
    print(f"Total count: {count}")
