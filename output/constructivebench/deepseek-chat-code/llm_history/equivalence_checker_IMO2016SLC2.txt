Ground Truth Answer: {1}
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | ∃ k, n = (k + 1) * (k + 2)}
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for which natural numbers n > 0 there exists an r × c matrix of divisors of n where:
   - All entries are distinct
   - All row sums are equal
   - All column sums are equal

2. The ground truth answer is {1}, meaning only n=1 satisfies these conditions.

3. The proposed answer is the set of numbers that can be expressed as (k+1)(k+2) for some k.

Analysis:
- For n=1, we can create a 1×1 matrix [[1]] which trivially satisfies all conditions.
- For numbers of form (k+1)(k+2), it's not generally true that they satisfy the conditions. For example:
  - Take n=6 (k=1): The possible divisors are 1,2,3,6. It's impossible to arrange these in a matrix satisfying all conditions.
  - Take n=12 (k=2): Divisors are 1,2,3,4,6,12. Again, no such matrix exists.

The proposed answer incorrectly includes many numbers beyond just 1. The only correct answer is {1}.
