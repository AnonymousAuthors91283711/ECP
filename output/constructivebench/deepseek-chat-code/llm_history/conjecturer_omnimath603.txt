Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated pattern, we see that numbers ending with 1, 3, 7, or 9 satisfy k^k ≡ 1 mod 10. The count of such numbers up to 2013 can be calculated by considering that these endings repeat every 10 numbers. 

<<<201 * 4 + if 2013 % 10 ≥ 1 then 1 else 0 + if 2013 % 10 ≥ 3 then 1 else 0 + if 2013 % 10 ≥ 7 then 1 else 0 + if 2013 % 10 ≥ 9 then 1 else 0>>>
