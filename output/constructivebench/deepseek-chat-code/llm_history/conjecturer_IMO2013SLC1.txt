theorem IMO2013SLC1 (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) :
  IsLeast {k : ℕ | ∀ {d : ℕ} (a : Fin d → ℝ), 
    (∀ i, 0 ≤ a i ∧ a i ≤ 1) → (∑ i, a i = n) → 
    ∃ (partition : Fin d → Fin k), ∀ (j : Fin k), ∑ i in {i | partition i = j}, a i ≤ 1} 
  (IMO2013SLC1_answer n) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=1: minimal k is 2

n=3: minimal k is 4
n=4: minimal k is 5
n=5: minimal k is 6
n=6: minimal k is 7
n=7: minimal k is 8
n=8: minimal k is 9
n=9: minimal k is 10
n=10: minimal k is 11. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
