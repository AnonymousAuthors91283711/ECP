[write_program]
This problem involves finding a real number x (with certain constraints) and positive coprime integers m, n such that a logarithmic equation holds, and then computing m+n. We'll write a Python program to search for possible x values and corresponding m, n pairs.

The approach will:
1. Iterate through possible x values in a reasonable range (avoiding the excluded points)
2. For each x, compute both sides of the logarithmic equation
3. Find rational approximations to match the equation
4. Check for coprime m, n pairs that satisfy the condition

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def find_solutions():
    # We'll search x in (0,1) excluding 1/20 and 1/2, with small steps
    step = 0.0001
    for i in range(1, 10000):
        x = i * step
        if abs(x - 1/20) < 1e-6 or abs(x - 1/2) < 1e-6:
            continue
            
        try:
            # Compute left side of equation: log_{20x}(22x)
            lhs = math.log(22 * x) / math.log(20 * x)
            
            # Find rational approximation for right side
            # We'll try denominators up to 1000
            for denom in range(1, 1001):
                numer = round(lhs * denom)
                if numer <= 0:
                    continue
                
                # Check if approximation is close enough
                if abs(lhs - numer/denom) < 1e-6:
                    # Simplify fraction
                    f = Fraction(numer, denom)
                    m, n = f.numerator, f.denominator
                    if math.gcd(m, n) == 1:
                        print(f"x = {x:.5f}, m = {m}, n = {n}, m+n = {m+n}")
                        return  # Stop after first valid solution found
        except ValueError:
            continue  # Skip invalid log domains
