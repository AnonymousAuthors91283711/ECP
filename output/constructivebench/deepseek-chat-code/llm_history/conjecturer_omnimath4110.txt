The error occurs because the syntax `∃ c ∈ ℝ` is incorrect in Lean for set comprehensions. In Lean, we need to use `∃ (c : ℝ)` instead. Also, the enumerated answers suggest that only constant functions 0 and 1 satisfy the condition, which matches our proposed solution.

Here's the corrected version:

<<<{f | ∃ (c : ℝ), f = Function.const ℝ c ∧ (c = 0 ∨ c = 1)}>>>

Explanation:
1. The error was fixed by changing `∃ c ∈ ℝ` to `∃ (c : ℝ)` which is the proper Lean syntax for existential quantification with type annotation.
2. The solution maintains the same logical structure: we're looking for constant functions where the constant is either 0 or 1.
3. The enumerated answers confirm that these are indeed the only solutions (constant 0 and constant 1 functions).
4. The set comprehension correctly represents all functions of the form f(x) = c where c is 0 or 1.
