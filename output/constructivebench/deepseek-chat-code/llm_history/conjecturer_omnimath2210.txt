Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated pairs, we observe two patterns:
1. Diagonal pairs (a,a) where both coordinates are equal
2. Off-diagonal pairs (a,-(a-1)) and (-a,a-1)

The count of solutions is symmetric around 0. The maximum |a| is 31 since 31²+31²=1922<2019 but 32²+32²=2048>2019. 

The total count is:
- 63 diagonal pairs (from -31 to 31)
- 62 off-diagonal pairs (31 each side × 2 directions)
