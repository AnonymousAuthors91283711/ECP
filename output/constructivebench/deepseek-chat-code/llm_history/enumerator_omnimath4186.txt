This problem involves finding all pairs of real-valued functions (f, g) that satisfy a given functional equation. We'll approach it by testing simple polynomial forms (linear functions) since they often satisfy such equations.

The strategy is:
1. Assume f and g are linear functions: f(x) = a*x + b, g(x) = c*x + d
2. Substitute into the equation and solve for coefficients
3. Enumerate possible solutions by testing small integer values for parameters

```python
def solve_functional_equation():
    # Test linear functions f(x) = a*x + b, g(x) = c*x + d
    # We'll try small integer values for a, b, c, d
    for a in range(-3, 4):
        for b in range(-3, 4):
            for c in range(-3, 4):
                for d in range(-3, 4):
                    # Skip trivial cases
                    if a == 0 and b == 0 and c == 0 and d == 0:
                        continue
                    
                    # Define the functions
                    def f(x):
                        return a * x + b
                    
                    def g(x):
                        return c * x + d
                    
                    # Test the equation with sample x and y values
                    valid = True
                    for x_test in [-1, 0, 1, 2]:
                        for y_test in [-1, 0, 1, 2]:
                            lhs = f(x_test + g(y_test))
                            rhs = x_test * f(y_test) - y_test * f(x_test) + g(x_test)
                            if not abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-6:  # Account for floating point errors
                                valid = False
                                break
                        if not valid:
                            break
                    
                    if valid:
                        print(f"Found solution: f(x) = {a}x + {b}, g(x) = {c}x + {d}")
