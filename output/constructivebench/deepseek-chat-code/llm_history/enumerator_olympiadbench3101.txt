This problem involves solving a nested square root equation where we need to find the value of x that satisfies the equation when T=11. The equation is √(20 + √(T + x)) = 5. We'll write a Python program to solve for x by reversing the operations.

The approach is:
1. Start with the equation √(20 + √(11 + x)) = 5
2. Square both sides to eliminate the outer square root
3. Subtract 20 from both sides
4. Square again to eliminate the inner square root
5. Subtract 11 to solve for x

```python
def solve_for_x(T):
    # Step-by-step solution of the equation sqrt(20 + sqrt(T + x)) = 5
    # 1. Square both sides: 20 + sqrt(T + x) = 25
    # 2. Subtract 20: sqrt(T + x) = 5
    # 3. Square again: T + x = 25
    # 4. Solve for x: x = 25 - T
    return 25 - T

# Given T = 11 as per the problem statement
T = 11
x = solve_for_x(T)
print(f"For T = {T}, x = {x}")
```
