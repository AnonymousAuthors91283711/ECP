[write_program]
This problem involves finding the number of primes between two real numbers, then applying that function to its own result. We'll write a Python program to:
1. Find all primes between 20 and 30 (since f(20) counts primes in [20,30])
2. Compute f(20) = count of those primes
3. Find all primes between f(20) and f(20)+10
4. Count those primes to get f(f(20))

We'll implement prime checking and counting functions, then compute the required values.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n in (2, 3):
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for p in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % p == 0:
            return False
    return True

def count_primes_between(a, b):
    count = 0
    # Round a up and b down to integers since primes are integers
    start = int(a) + (1 if a > int(a) else 0)
    end = int(b)
    for p in range(start, end + 1):
        if is_prime(p):
            count += 1
    return count

# Step 1: Compute f(20)
f20 = count_primes_between(20, 30)
print(f"f(20) = {f20}")

# Step 2: Compute f(f(20)) = f(f20)
ff20 = count_primes_between(f20, f20 + 10)
print(f"f(f(20)) = {ff20}")
```
