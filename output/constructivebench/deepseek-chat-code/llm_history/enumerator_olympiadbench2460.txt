[write_program]
This problem asks to find all positive integer pairs (a, b) such that a³ + 2ab = 2013. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible solutions by iterating through possible values of a and solving for b, checking if it's a positive integer.

The approach:
1. Iterate a from 1 upwards until a³ exceeds 2013
2. For each a, compute b = (2013 - a³)/(2a)
3. Check if b is a positive integer
4. Output valid pairs immediately when found

```python
def find_solutions():
    target = 2013
    max_a = int(target ** (1/3)) + 2  # Upper bound for a
    solutions = []
    
    for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
        a_cubed = a ** 3
        if a_cubed > target:
            break
        numerator = target - a_cubed
        if numerator <= 0:
            continue
        if numerator % (2 * a) != 0:
            continue
        b = numerator // (2 * a)
        if b > 0:
            solutions.append((a, b))
            print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}")
    
    print("\nAll solutions found:")
    for sol in solutions:
        print(sol)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solutions()
```
