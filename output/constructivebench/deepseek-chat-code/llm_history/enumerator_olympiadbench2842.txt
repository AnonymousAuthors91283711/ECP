This problem involves finding the number of workers required based on a given rate and work amount. The relationship is derived from the given equations. We'll enumerate possible rational values for K (since K â‰  0) and compute the corresponding requiredWorkers.

The key steps are:
1. Compute rate = 9/K
2. Compute requiredWorkers = (720/K) / (4 * rate)
3. Simplify the expression to find the pattern

The program will:
- Test small non-zero rational values for K
- Compute and print the requiredWorkers for each K
- Show that the result is constant regardless of K

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_required_workers(K):
    rate = Fraction(9, K)
    numerator = Fraction(720, K)
    denominator = 4 * rate
    return numerator / denominator

# Test with various non-zero K values
test_values = [Fraction(1), Fraction(2), Fraction(3,2), Fraction(1,2), Fraction(-1)]

print("Testing different K values:")
for K in test_values:
    workers = compute_required_workers(K)
    print(f"For K = {K}, required workers = {workers}")

# The output shows the result is always 20 regardless of K
print("\nThe required number of workers is constant:")
print(20)
```
