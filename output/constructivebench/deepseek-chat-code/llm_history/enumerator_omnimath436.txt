[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of integer pairs (x,y) such that x² + 2y² < 25. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible integer pairs within reasonable bounds that satisfy this inequality.

The approach is:
1. Determine bounds for x and y based on the inequality
2. For x, since x² < 25 ⇒ -4 ≤ x ≤ 4
3. For y, since 2y² < 25 ⇒ -3 ≤ y ≤ 3
4. Check all combinations in these ranges
5. Count the pairs that satisfy the condition

```python
def count_pairs():
    count = 0
    # Iterate over possible x values (-4 to 4)
    for x in range(-4, 5):
        # Iterate over possible y values (-3 to 3)
        for y in range(-3, 4):
            if x**2 + 2*y**2 < 25:
                print(f"Found pair: ({x}, {y})")
                count += 1
    print(f"Total pairs: {count}")

count_pairs()
```
