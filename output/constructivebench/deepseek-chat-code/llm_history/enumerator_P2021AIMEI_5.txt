[write_program]
The problem is to find all triples (a, b, c) of integers between -100 and 100 that satisfy:
1. a < b < c (strictly increasing)
2. b - a = c - b (arithmetic sequence)
3. a² + b² + c² = b(b - a)²
4. Then sum all valid c values

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible triples in the range [-100, 100] that satisfy these conditions.

```python
def solve():
    total = 0
    for a in range(-100, 101):
        for b in range(a + 1, 101):  # a < b
            # Since it's arithmetic, c = 2b - a
            c = 2 * b - a
            if c <= b:  # must have b < c
                continue
            if c < -100 or c > 100:  # c must be in range
                continue
            # Check the equation a² + b² + c² == b * (b - a)**2
            left = a*a + b*b + c*c
            right = b * (b - a)**2
            if left == right:
                print(f"Found valid triple: ({a}, {b}, {c})")
                total += c
    print(f"Sum of all valid c values: {total}")

solve()
```
