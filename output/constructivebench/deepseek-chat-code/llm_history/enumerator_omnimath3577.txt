[write_program]
This problem asks to find all positive integer quadruples (x,y,z,t) satisfying the equation 12^x + 13^y - 14^z = 2013^t. We'll write a Python program to search for solutions by bounding the exponents and checking possible combinations.

The approach:
1. Since 2013^t grows rapidly, we'll limit t to small values (t â‰¤ 3)
2. For each t, compute the right-hand side (2013^t)
3. For each possible y, compute 13^y and see if 12^x - 14^z = RHS - 13^y has solutions
4. Use modular arithmetic checks to prune impossible cases early

```python
def solve():
    max_t = 3
    max_exp = 20  # reasonable upper bound for exponents
    
    for t in range(1, max_t + 1):
        rhs = 2013 ** t
        print(f"\nChecking t = {t}, RHS = {rhs}")
        
        for y in range(1, max_exp + 1):
            term_y = 13 ** y
            if term_y > rhs + (14 ** max_exp):  # 13^y too large
                continue
                
            remaining = rhs - term_y
            if remaining <= 0:
                continue
                
            # Check if remaining can be expressed as 12^x - 14^z
            for x in range(1, max_exp + 1):
                term_x = 12 ** x
                if term_x <= remaining:
                    z_candidate = term_x - remaining
                    if z_candidate <= 0:
                        continue
                    # Check if z_candidate is a power of 14
                    z = 1
                    while 14 ** z <= z_candidate:
                        if 14 ** z == z_candidate:
                            print(f"Found solution: (x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, t={t})")
                        z += 1
                else:
                    # Now check if remaining = 12^x - 14^z (negative case)
                    for z in range(1, max_exp + 1):
                        if term_x - (14 ** z) == remaining:
                            print(f"Found solution: (x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, t={t})")
