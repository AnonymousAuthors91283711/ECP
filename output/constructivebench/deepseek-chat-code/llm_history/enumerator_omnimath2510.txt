[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of functions f from {0,...,9} to {0,...,9} such that for all i,j where i+j+2=11, we have f(i)+f(j)=11. 

We'll enumerate all possible functions satisfying the condition by:
1. Observing the constraints come in pairs (i,j) where j=9-i
2. For each such pair, f(i)+f(9-i)=11
3. The function is completely determined by its values on 0-4 (since f(9-i)=11-f(i))
4. We'll count all valid assignments to 0-4 where f(i) and f(9-i) are both in 0-9

```python
from itertools import product

def count_functions():
    # The constraints are f(i) + f(9-i) = 11 for i=0..4
    # We need to count all possible assignments to f(0),...,f(4)
    # where both f(i) and 11-f(i) are in 0..9
    
    count = 0
    # Possible values for each f(i) where both f(i) and 11-f(i) are valid
    possible_values = [y for y in range(10) if 0 <= 11-y < 10]
    
    # Generate all possible combinations for f(0) to f(4)
    for assignment in product(possible_values, repeat=5):
        count += 1
    
    print(f"Number of valid functions: {count}")

count_functions()
```
