[write_program]
This problem is about finding a unique natural number x ≤ 10 that satisfies the equation 3x + 2(10 - x) = 26. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible x values up to 10 and check which ones satisfy the equation.

The equation simplifies to:
3x + 20 - 2x = 26 → x + 20 = 26 → x = 6

We'll verify this by checking all x from 0 to 10.

```python
def solve():
    for x in range(0, 11):  # Check x from 0 to 10 inclusive
        if 3 * x + 2 * (10 - x) == 26:
            print(f"Found solution: x = {x}")
            return  # Since we're told there's a unique solution, we can stop after finding it
    print("No solution found")

solve()
```
