This problem involves finding the value of the expression (9a + 8b)/(6a) given that a = (2/3)b and b â‰  0. We can solve this algebraically by substituting a in terms of b and simplifying the expression.

The Python program will demonstrate this by:
1. Symbolically substituting a = (2/3)b into the expression
2. Simplifying the resulting expression to find the constant value
3. Printing the simplified result

```python
from sympy import symbols, simplify

def solve_problem():
    # Define symbolic variables
    b = symbols('b')
    a = (2/3) * b
    
    # Construct the expression
    numerator = 9*a + 8*b
    denominator = 6*a
    expression = numerator / denominator
    
    # Simplify and print the result
    simplified = simplify(expression)
    print(f"The simplified expression evaluates to: {simplified}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_problem()
```
