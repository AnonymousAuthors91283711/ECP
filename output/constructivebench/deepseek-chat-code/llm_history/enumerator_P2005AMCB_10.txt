This problem involves iteratively summing the cubes of digits of a number (2005) for 2005 iterations. We need to find the final result. The key observation is that this process will eventually enter a cycle (like the happy number problem). We'll write a Python program to simulate this process and find the cycle.

```python
def digit_cubes_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d)**3 for d in str(n))

def find_cycle(start, max_iterations):
    seen = {}
    sequence = []
    current = start
    for i in range(max_iterations):
        if current in seen:
            cycle_start = seen[current]
            cycle = sequence[cycle_start:]
            return sequence[:cycle_start], cycle
        seen[current] = i
        sequence.append(current)
        current = digit_cubes_sum(current)
    return sequence, []

def main():
    start = 2005
    max_iter = 2005
    prefix, cycle = find_cycle(start, max_iter)
    
    print("Sequence prefix:", prefix)
    if cycle:
        print("Found cycle:", cycle)
        # Calculate where 2005 iterations lands
        prefix_len = len(prefix)
        cycle_len = len(cycle)
        remaining = max_iter - prefix_len
        if remaining >= 0:
            result = cycle[remaining % cycle_len]
            print(f"After {max_iter} iterations: {result}")
        else:
            print("Didn't reach cycle within iterations")
    else:
        print("No cycle found within iterations")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
