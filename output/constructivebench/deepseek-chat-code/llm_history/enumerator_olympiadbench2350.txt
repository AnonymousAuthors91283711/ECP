[write_program]
This problem involves counting numbers k from 1 to 2014 where a certain combinatorial function f(k) modulo 10 equals 1. The function f is defined as (k+4 choose 4) minus (k+3 choose 3) when k â‰¥ 2, and just (k+4 choose 4) otherwise.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Compute the function f(k) for each k from 1 to 2014
2. Check if f(k) % 10 == 1
3. Count all such k values
4. Output the count as the answer

The program will compute combinations efficiently using the multiplicative formula to avoid large intermediate values.

```python
def count_special_numbers():
    count = 0
    for k in range(1, 2015):
        # Compute (k+4 choose 4)
        c4 = (k+4)*(k+3)*(k+2)*(k+1) // 24
        # Compute (k+3 choose 3) if k >= 2
        c3 = (k+3)*(k+2)*(k+1) // 6 if k >= 2 else 0
        fk = c4 - c3
        if fk % 10 == 1:
            count += 1
    print(count)

count_special_numbers()
```
