Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: 6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number b > 0 where:
   - total = 6 + b (total items)
   - sameColor = 3 + C(b, 2) (number of same-color pairs)
   - The ratio sameColor/totalPairs = 1/5

2. Calculating total pairs: C(total, 2) = C(6+b, 2) = (6+b)(5+b)/2

3. The equation becomes: (3 + b(b-1)/2) / ((6+b)(5+b)/2) = 1/5

4. Simplifying: (6 + b² - b)/(b² + 11b + 30) = 1/5

5. Cross-multiplying: 5b² - 5b + 30 = b² + 11b + 30

6. Simplifying: 4b² - 16b = 0 => 4b(b-4) = 0

7. Solutions: b=0 or b=4 (but b>0)

The ground truth answer correctly gives b=4 as the smallest solution. The proposed answer of 6 is incorrect as it's not the minimal solution and doesn't satisfy the equation as well as 4 does.
