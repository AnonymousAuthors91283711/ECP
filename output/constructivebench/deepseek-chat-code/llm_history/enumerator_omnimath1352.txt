[write_program]
This problem involves finding the sum of a sequence of 10 positive integers where each term is defined recursively based on the GCD of its neighbors. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible sequences and their sums to identify patterns.

The key observations:
1. Each term S[i] = 1 + gcd(S[i-1], S[i+1]) (with indices modulo 10)
2. The sequence is circular (S[0] depends on S[9] and S[1])
3. We need to find all possible sequences and their sums

We'll implement a backtracking approach to generate valid sequences up to a reasonable length, then look for repeating patterns that satisfy the circular condition.

```python
import math
from itertools import product

def find_sequences():
    # Try small values since terms are based on GCD which tends to reduce values
    max_val = 20
    # We'll look for repeating patterns of length 1, 2, or 5 (divisors of 10)
    for pattern_length in [1, 2, 5]:
        # Generate all possible patterns of given length
        for pattern in product(range(1, max_val+1), repeat=pattern_length):
            valid = True
            total = 0
            sequence = []
            # Check if pattern satisfies the recurrence when repeated
            for i in range(10):
                prev = pattern[(i-1) % pattern_length]
                next_val = pattern[(i+1) % pattern_length]
                computed = 1 + math.gcd(prev, next_val)
                expected = pattern[i % pattern_length]
                if computed != expected:
                    valid = False
                    break
                sequence.append(expected)
                total += expected
            if valid:
                print(f"Found valid sequence: {sequence} with sum {total}")
                # For pattern_length=1, we can return immediately as it's minimal
                if pattern_length == 1:
                    return

find_sequences()
```
