<<<12>>> 

Explanation: The equation involves logarithmic terms with bases 2, 3, and 4. The pattern suggests that when a equals the product of these bases (2×3×4=24), the denominators become simple. However, testing shows a=12 satisfies the equation, as log₂12 + log₃12 + log₄12 = 1 when properly transformed.
