open Rat

abbrev omnimath3372_answer : ℕ → Rat := sorry
theorem omnimath3372 (n : ℕ) (hn : n ≠ 0) : 
  (1 / n) = omnimath3372_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (1 / (2 * n)) + (1 / (3 * n)) + (1 / (6 * n))
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 1 / n
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem asks for a function that equals 1/n for all non-zero natural numbers n.

2. The ground truth answer is (1/(2n)) + (1/(3n)) + (1/(6n)) = (3 + 2 + 1)/(6n) = 6/(6n) = 1/n.

3. The proposed answer is simply 1/n.

4. Both functions indeed equal 1/n for all n ≠ 0.

5. The ground truth answer is a more complicated expression that simplifies to 1/n, while the proposed answer is the direct expression.

6. Mathematically, they are equivalent functions.
