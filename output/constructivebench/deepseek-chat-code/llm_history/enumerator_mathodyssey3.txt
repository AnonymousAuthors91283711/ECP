[write_program]
This problem involves finding natural numbers c and s (with c < s) and a real t > 1 that satisfy two equations:
1. c*t + s = 100
2. c + s*t = 101

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible integer values of c and s (since they're natural numbers) and solve for t in each case, checking if t > 1.

```python
def solve_problem():
    # We'll iterate c from 1 upwards (since c >= 1)
    # s must be greater than c (c < s) and both are integers
    for c in range(1, 100):
        for s in range(c+1, 100):
            # Solve the system of equations for t
            # From first equation: t = (100 - s)/c
            # From second equation: t = (101 - c)/s
            # They must be equal
            numerator1 = 100 - s
            denominator1 = c
            numerator2 = 101 - c
            denominator2 = s
            
            # Check if the two expressions for t are equal
            if numerator1 * denominator2 == numerator2 * denominator1:
                t1 = numerator1 / denominator1
                t2 = numerator2 / denominator2
                if t1 > 1 and abs(t1 - t2) < 1e-9:  # Account for floating point precision
                    print(f"c = {c}, s = {s}, t = {t1}")
                    if s > 50:
                        print(f"Found solution with s > 50: s = {s}")

solve_problem()
```

The program will output all valid (c, s, t) triples that satisfy the given conditions, and specifically highlight solutions where s > 50. The output will help identify the value of mathodyssey3_answer by showing the valid s values that satisfy all constraints.
