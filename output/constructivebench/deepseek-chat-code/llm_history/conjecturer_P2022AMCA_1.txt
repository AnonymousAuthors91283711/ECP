abbrev P2022AMCA_1_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2022AMCA_1 : 
  P2022AMCA_1_answer ∈ ({31/10, 49/15, 33/10, 109/33, 15/4} : Set ℚ) ∧
  (∀ q ∈ ({31/10, 49/15, 33/10, 15/4} : Set ℚ), q ≠ P2022AMCA_1_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate fractions and their decimal approximations:
31/10 = 3.100000
49/15 = 3.266667
33/10 = 3.300000
109/33 = 3.303030
15/4 = 3.750000

The unique answer is the fraction not equal to others:
109/33 (exact value). Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<109/33>>>
