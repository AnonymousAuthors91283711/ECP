theorem omnimath3437
(S : Set ℕ)
(hS : S = {p : ℕ | ∃ a b : ℤ, a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ a * b = 24 ∧ 2 * (a + b) = p})
: (S ≠ Set.univ ∧ omnimath3437_answer ∉ S) ∧ (∀ p : ℕ, p ∉ S → p = omnimath3437_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking candidate: 1
Found missing p: 1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the problem statement and enumerated hint (missing p=1), the answer is clearly the smallest natural number not in S. Since S consists of numbers of form 2*(a+b) where a*b=24 with a,b>0, and 1 is the smallest missing value, we conclude:
