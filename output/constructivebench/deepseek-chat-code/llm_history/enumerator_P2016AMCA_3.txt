[write_program]
This problem appears to be about finding a rational function (or operation) that takes two rational numbers as input and produces another rational number as output. The given example shows that when the inputs are 3/8 and -2/5, the output should be -1/40.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate simple arithmetic operations between two rational numbers to find operations that satisfy the given example. We'll test common binary operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) and combinations thereof.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def test_operations(a, b):
    a = Fraction(a)
    b = Fraction(b)
    target = Fraction(-1, 40)
    
    # Test basic arithmetic operations
    operations = [
        ('a + b', lambda a, b: a + b),
        ('a - b', lambda a, b: a - b),
        ('b - a', lambda a, b: b - a),
        ('a * b', lambda a, b: a * b),
        ('a / b', lambda a, b: a / b),
        ('b / a', lambda a, b: b / a),
        ('(a + b)/2', lambda a, b: (a + b)/2),
        ('1/(1/a + 1/b)', lambda a, b: 1/(1/a + 1/b) if (a != 0 and b != 0) else None),
        ('a*b/(a + b)', lambda a, b: a*b/(a + b) if (a + b != 0) else None),
    ]
    
    for name, op in operations:
        try:
            result = op(a, b)
            if result == target:
                print(f"Found matching operation: {name} = {result}")
        except (ZeroDivisionError, TypeError):
            continue

# Given example values
a = Fraction(3, 8)
b = Fraction(-2, 5)
print(f"Testing with a = {a}, b = {b}")
test_operations(a, b)
```
