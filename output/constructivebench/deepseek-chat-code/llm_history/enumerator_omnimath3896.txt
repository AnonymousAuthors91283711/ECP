[write_program]
This problem asks for all natural numbers n ≥ 2 where for any two numbers a,b coprime with n, the equivalence a ≡ b mod n holds if and only if a*b ≡ 1 mod n. We need to find all such n.

The condition implies that for every a coprime with n, a² ≡ 1 mod n. This is a special property satisfied by certain numbers. We'll write a program to check this condition for numbers up to a reasonable threshold.

```python
import math

def is_candidate(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    # Check for all a coprime with n that a^2 ≡ 1 mod n
    for a in range(1, n):
        if math.gcd(a, n) == 1:
            if (a * a) % n != 1:
                return False
    return True

def main():
    max_n = 100  # Reasonable threshold to find all such numbers
    candidates = []
    for n in range(2, max_n + 1):
        if is_candidate(n):
            candidates.append(n)
            print(n)  # Stream partial results
    
    print("All candidates up to", max_n, ":", candidates)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
