[write_program]
This problem involves finding unique natural numbers a, b, c, k where c is not a perfect square, and a + √(b + √c) is a root of the given quartic polynomial. We'll write a Python program to search for possible values of c (the final answer) by checking small integer values.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible c values (non-squares)
2. For each c, try small a, b values
3. Check if a + √(b + √c) satisfies the polynomial equation
4. Track unique solutions

```python
import math
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def is_square(n):
    return math.isqrt(n) ** 2 == n

def find_solutions():
    found_c = set()
    for c in range(1, 1000):
        if is_square(c):
            continue  # c must not be square
        
        sqrt_c = math.sqrt(c)
        for b in range(1, 100):
            inner = b + sqrt_c
            if inner <= 0:
                continue
            sqrt_inner = math.sqrt(inner)
            for a in range(1, 100):
                x = a + sqrt_inner
                # Check if x satisfies x^4 -20x^3 +108x^2 -k*x +9 = 0
                # We can express k in terms of x and check if it's integer
                x_sq = x*x
                k = (x_sq*x_sq - 20*x_sq*x + 108*x_sq + 9) / x
                if abs(k - round(k)) < 1e-8 and k > 0:
                    k_int = round(k)
                    print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, k={k_int}")
                    found_c.add(c)
    
    print("\nPossible c values found:", sorted(found_c))

find_solutions()
```
