This problem involves calculating a sum of products of fractions where each term depends on the previous one. The mathematical expression is given in Lean code, but we'll translate it to Python to compute the sum numerically.

The key components are:
1. X(k) = k-1
2. Y(k) = k-1
3. p(k) = X(k)/Y(k) = (k-1)/(k-1) = 1 (for k>1)
4. indicator(k) = p(k-1)*p(k) if k ≥ start+1 (4) else 0
5. Sum from k=start (3) to presses-1 (99) of indicator(k+1)

We'll compute this sum in Python, noting that p(k) is 1 for k>1, so the indicator simplifies to 1*1=1 when k+1 ≥4.

```python
def compute_sum():
    presses = 100
    start = 3
    total = 0.0
    
    for k in range(start, presses):
        # Compute indicator(k+1)
        if k + 1 >= start + 1:  # which is always true since k starts at 3
            # p(k) = (k-1)/(k-1) = 1 for k>1
            # p(k+1-1) = p(k) = 1
            # p(k+1) = 1
            indicator = 1.0 * 1.0  # p(k)*p(k+1)
        else:
            indicator = 0.0
        total += indicator
    
    print(f"Sum from k={start} to {presses-1}: {total}")

compute_sum()
