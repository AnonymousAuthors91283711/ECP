[write_program]
This problem asks for the sum of integers from 1 to 100. While the answer is well-known (5050), we'll write a Python program that calculates it properly to demonstrate the approach.

The program will:
1. Calculate the sum using a loop (naive approach)
2. Calculate using the formula n(n+1)/2 (efficient approach)
3. Verify both methods give the same result

```python
def main():
    # Method 1: Iterative sum
    sum_iter = 0
    for i in range(1, 101):
        sum_iter += i
    
    # Method 2: Formula
    n = 100
    sum_formula = n * (n + 1) // 2
    
    # Verify both methods agree
    assert sum_iter == sum_formula
    
    print(f"Sum from 1 to 100: {sum_formula}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
