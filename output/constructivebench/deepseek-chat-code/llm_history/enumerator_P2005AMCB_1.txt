The problem is calculating (1000/2)*1 - (1000/5)*2, which simplifies to floor division operations. We'll compute this directly in Python using integer division (//) since the problem appears to use floor division.

```python
# Compute (1000//2)*1 - (1000//5)*2
result = (1000 // 2) * 1 - (1000 // 5) * 2
print(result)
```
