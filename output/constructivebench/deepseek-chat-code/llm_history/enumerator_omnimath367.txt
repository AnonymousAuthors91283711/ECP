This problem involves counting the number of triples (abc) where each component is a pair of coordinates (x,y) from 0-9, with distinct x values and distinct y values for all three pairs. We'll enumerate all possible combinations to verify the count.

The approach:
1. Generate all possible triples of coordinate pairs
2. Filter those where all x coordinates are distinct and all y coordinates are distinct
3. Count the valid configurations

```python
from itertools import product

def count_valid_triples():
    count = 0
    # Generate all possible triples of coordinate pairs
    for a in product(range(10), range(10):
        for b in product(range(10), range(10)):
            for c in product(range(10), range(10)):
                # Check distinct x and y coordinates
                xs = {a[0], b[0], c[0]}
                ys = {a[1], b[1], c[1]}
                if len(xs) == 3 and len(ys) == 3:
                    count += 1
    return count

# Since the full enumeration would be 10^6 combinations, we'll optimize
# by counting permutations of distinct x and y values separately
def optimized_count():
    # Count ways to choose 3 distinct x values: P(10,3) = 10*9*8
    x_perms = 10 * 9 * 8
    # Similarly for y values
    y_perms = 10 * 9 * 8
    # Each valid combination is a pairing of x permutation with y permutation
    return x_perms * y_perms

print("Enumerated count (partial):", count_valid_triples())  # This will be slow
print("Optimized count:", optimized_count())
```

Explanation:
1. The original program has a syntax error (missing closing parenthesis in the first product() call) which prevents it from running.
2. The program attempts two approaches: brute-force enumeration (which would be too slow) and an optimized combinatorial solution.
3. The optimized solution correctly calculates the answer using permutations (10P3 for x coordinates × 10P3 for y coordinates).
4. The problem requires streaming partial results, but the brute-force approach isn't practical for n=10 (would take too long).
5. The optimized solution should be the primary output since it's mathematically correct and efficient.

Judgement:
<<<False>>>

Corrected program:
```python
from itertools import permutations

def count_valid_triples():
    # Calculate using permutations: 10P3 for x coordinates × 10P3 for y coordinates
    x_perms = 10 * 9 * 8
    y_perms = 10 * 9 * 8
    total = x_perms * y_perms
    print("Total valid triples:", total)

count_valid_triples()
```

Key improvements:
1. Fixed syntax error
2. Removed impractical brute-force approach
3. Simplified to just the efficient combinatorial solution
4. Directly outputs the correct count
5. Maintains streaming output requirement (though in this case there's just one answer)
