[write_program]
The problem asks for the count of numbers \(2^k\) (for \(k\) from 1 to 332) whose decimal representation starts with the digit 4. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such numbers and count them.

```python
def count_powers_of_two_with_leading_four(max_k):
    count = 0
    for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
        power = 2 ** k
        leading_digit = int(str(power)[0])
        if leading_digit == 4:
            print(f"2^{k} = {power} starts with 4")
            count += 1
    return count

max_k = 332
print(f"Counting powers of 2 from k=1 to k={max_k} that start with digit 4")
result = count_powers_of_two_with_leading_four(max_k)
print(f"Total count: {result}")
```
