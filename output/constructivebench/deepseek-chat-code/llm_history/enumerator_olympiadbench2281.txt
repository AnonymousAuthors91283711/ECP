This problem involves solving the equation `3*8^x + 5*8^x = 2^61` for real x. We can simplify the equation first by combining like terms, then solve for x. The program will enumerate possible integer values of x to find when the equation holds.

```python
def solve_equation():
    # Combine terms: 3*8^x + 5*8^x = (3+5)*8^x = 8*8^x = 8^(x+1)
    # So equation becomes 8^(x+1) = 2^61
    # Since 8 = 2^3, we can rewrite as (2^3)^(x+1) = 2^61 => 2^(3x+3) = 2^61
    # Therefore 3x + 3 = 61 => x = (61-3)/3 = 58/3 â‰ˆ 19.333...
    
    # For demonstration, let's verify this solution
    x = 58/3
    left_side = 3 * (8 ** x) + 5 * (8 ** x)
    right_side = 2 ** 61
    print(f"Verification for x = {x}:")
    print(f"Left side: {left_side}")
    print(f"Right side: {right_side}")
    print(f"Difference: {abs(left_side - right_side)} (should be very small)")

    # The exact solution is x = 58/3
    print("\nThe exact solution is x = 58/3")
