This problem asks to find a natural number `omnimath3474_answer` such that there does not exist any natural number `k` satisfying the equation `3*k + 2*k = omnimath3474_answer`. The equation simplifies to `5*k = omnimath3474_answer`, so we're looking for numbers not divisible by 5.

The Python program will enumerate natural numbers and check which ones are not divisible by 5, printing them as candidates. Since there are infinitely many such numbers, we'll limit the enumeration to a reasonable range (say 1 to 20) to demonstrate the pattern.

```python
def enumerate_non_multiples_of_5():
    max_n = 20  # Sample range
    print(f"Checking numbers from 1 to {max_n} not divisible by 5:")
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        if n % 5 != 0:
            print(n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_non_multiples_of_5()
```
