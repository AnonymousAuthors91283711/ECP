Looking at the error message and the proposed answer, I notice several issues:
1. The parentheses are mismatched in the trigonometric expressions
2. The union operator `∪` needs proper spacing
3. The square root expressions need proper grouping

Based on the problem statement (finding s where sinθ = s and cosθ = tanθ), we can derive that s must satisfy s = ±√(1 - cos²θ) where cosθ = tanθ. Solving cosθ = tanθ leads to solutions involving the golden ratio (√5 - 1)/2.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<{s : ℝ | ∃ k : ℤ, s = Real.sin (Real.arctan (Real.sqrt ((Real.sqrt 5 - 1)/2)) + k * π)} ∪ 
{s : ℝ | ∃ k : ℤ, s = -Real.sin (Real.arctan (Real.sqrt ((Real.sqrt 5 - 1)/2)) + k * π)}>>>

The key fixes are:
1. Added missing closing parenthesis after `k * π`
2. Maintained consistent spacing around the union operator
3. Kept the mathematical structure involving arctan of the square root of (√5 - 1)/2, which comes from solving cosθ = tanθ
4. Included both positive and negative solutions since sinθ can be either positive or negative for the same cosθ value[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error occurs because `π` needs to be properly imported/qualified. In Lean's Mathlib, `π` is typically accessed through `Real.pi`. Additionally, the proposed answer seems overly complex for the given problem. The equation `cos θ = tan θ` can be simplified to `cos² θ = sin θ`, which is a quadratic in `sin θ`. The simpler solution would be to use the roots of this equation.

Here's the corrected and simplified answer:

<<<{s : ℝ | s = Real.sqrt ((Real.sqrt 5 - 1)/2) ∨ s = -Real.sqrt ((Real.sqrt 5 - 1)/2)}>>>

Explanation:
1. Starting from `cos θ = tan θ`, we rewrite as `cos θ = sin θ / cos θ`
2. Multiply both sides by `cos θ` to get `cos² θ = sin θ`
3. Using `cos² θ = 1 - sin² θ`, we get `1 - sin² θ = sin θ`
4. Rearrange to `sin² θ + sin θ - 1 = 0`
5. Solve the quadratic to get `sin θ = (-1 ± √5)/2`
6. Only the positive root `(-1 + √5)/2` is valid since `sin θ` must be in [-1,1]
7. The simplified form uses `√((√5 - 1)/2)` which is equivalent to the positive root solution

The answer is simpler because:
- It doesn't need trigonometric functions in the solution set
- It directly gives the possible values of `s` (sin θ)
- It avoids the periodic solutions since we're only asked for the possible values, not all θ solutions
