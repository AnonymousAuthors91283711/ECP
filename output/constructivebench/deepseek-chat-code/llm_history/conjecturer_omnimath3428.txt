abbrev omnimath3428_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3428 (s t : ℝ) : 0.1 * s = t ↔ s = omnimath3428_answer t := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing relationship 0.1*s = t for various t values:
t = -2.00 → s = -20.00 → 0.1*s = -2.00 (should equal -2.00)
t = -1.00 → s = -10.00 → 0.1*s = -1.00 (should equal -1.00)
t = 0.00 → s = 0.00 → 0.1*s = 0.00 (should equal 0.00)
t = 1.00 → s = 10.00 → 0.1*s = 1.00 (should equal 1.00)
t = 2.00 → s = 20.00 → 0.1*s = 2.00 (should equal 2.00)
t = 3.14 → s = 31.40 → 0.1*s = 3.14 (should equal 3.14)
t = 10.00 → s = 100.00 → 0.1*s = 10.00 (should equal 10.00). Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
<<<fun t : ℝ => 10 * t>>>
