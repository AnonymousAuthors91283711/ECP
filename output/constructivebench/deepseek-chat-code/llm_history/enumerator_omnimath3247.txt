This problem asks for the value of (3*k) mod 7 when k mod 7 is 3. We can enumerate all possible k values congruent to 3 mod 7 and compute (3*k) mod 7 to find the pattern.

```python
def enumerate_omnimath3247():
    # Since k ≡ 3 mod 7, k can be written as 7m + 3 for integer m
    # We'll test several values of m to find the pattern for (3*k) mod 7
    print("Testing k ≡ 3 mod 7 cases:")
    for m in range(0, 7):  # Testing 7 cases is sufficient due to mod 7 periodicity
        k = 7 * m + 3
        result = (3 * k) % 7
        print(f"k = {k} ≡ 3 mod 7: (3*k) mod 7 = {result}")
    
    # After observing the pattern, we can conclude the constant answer
    print("\nFrom the pattern, we conclude that for all k ≡ 3 mod 7,")
    print("(3*k) mod 7 = 2")

enumerate_omnimath3247()
```
