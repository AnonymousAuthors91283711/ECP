This problem asks for the number of functions from a 9-element set to a 3-element set where:
1. Each of the three outputs (0,1,2) appears exactly 3 times
2. Exactly one input is mapped to its own index (f(i)=i)

We'll enumerate all possible functions meeting these criteria by:
1. First choosing which input will satisfy f(i)=i (9 choices)
2. Then distributing the remaining 8 inputs to outputs 0,1,2 with appropriate counts

```python
from itertools import combinations, permutations

def count_valid_functions():
    total = 0
    # The set has 9 elements (0-8)
    elements = range(9)
    
    # Try each possible fixed point
    for fixed in elements:
        remaining = [x for x in elements if x != fixed]
        
        # We need to assign the remaining 8 elements to 0,1,2 with:
        # - fixed's value appears 2 more times (since fixed counts as 1)
        # - other two values appear exactly 3 times
        
        # Determine which value is at the fixed point (0,1,2)
        for fixed_val in range(3):
            # The other two values
            other_vals = [v for v in range(3) if v != fixed_val]
            
            # We need to assign:
            # - fixed_val appears 2 more times in remaining
            # - other_vals[0] appears 3 times in remaining
            # - other_vals[1] appears 3 times in remaining
            
            # But 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 which matches remaining count
            
            # Choose 2 positions for fixed_val in remaining
            for fixed_positions in combinations(remaining, 2):
                remaining_after_fixed = [x for x in remaining if x not in fixed_positions]
                
                # Now assign 3 elements to other_vals[0] and 3 to other_vals[1]
                for val0_positions in combinations(remaining_after_fixed, 3):
                    # The rest go to val1
                    total += 1
    
    print(total)

count_valid_functions()
