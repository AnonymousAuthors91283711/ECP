theorem omnimath1894 :
  {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x y : ℝ, f (x ^ 2 + f y) = f (f x) + f (y ^ 2) + 2 * f (x * y)} = omnimath1894_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {fun x : ℝ => 0, fun x : ℝ => x ^ 2}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∀ x, f x = 0}
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is a functional equation asking to find all functions f: ℝ → ℝ that satisfy:
   f(x² + f(y)) = f(f(x)) + f(y²) + 2f(xy) for all x,y ∈ ℝ

2. The ground truth answer gives two solutions:
   - The zero function f(x) = 0
   - The quadratic function f(x) = x²

3. The proposed answer only includes the zero function: {f | ∀ x, f x = 0}

The proposed answer is missing the quadratic solution f(x) = x², which can be verified to satisfy the original equation:
For f(x) = x²:
f(x² + f(y)) = (x² + y²)²
f(f(x)) + f(y²) + 2f(xy) = (x²)² + (y²)² + 2(xy)² = x⁴ + y⁴ + 2x²y² = (x² + y²)²
Thus f(x) = x² is indeed a solution.
