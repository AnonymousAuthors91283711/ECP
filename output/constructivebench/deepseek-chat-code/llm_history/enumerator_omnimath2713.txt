This problem asks for a unique number N between 400 and 600 that is odd, divisible by both 5 and 11, and whose digit sum equals some unknown value (omnimath2713_answer). We'll write a Python program to find all candidates for N and their digit sums.

The approach:
1. Find all numbers between 401 and 599 (inclusive) that are odd and divisible by both 5 and 11 (which means divisible by 55)
2. For each candidate, calculate its digit sum
3. Print each valid number and its digit sum

```python
def find_candidates():
    # Numbers between 400 and 600, odd, divisible by 5*11=55
    start = (401 // 55 + 1) * 55  # First multiple of 55 >=401
    if start % 2 == 0:
        start += 55  # Make it odd
    end = 599
    candidates = []
    
    for n in range(start, end + 1, 110):  # Step by 2*55=110 to maintain odd and divisible by 55
        digit_sum = sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
        print(f"N = {n}, digit sum = {digit_sum}")
        candidates.append((n, digit_sum))
    
    print("\nAll candidates:")
    for n, s in candidates:
        print(f"{n}: sum={s}")

find_candidates()
```

The program will output all numbers meeting the criteria along with their digit sums. The step size is 110 because:
- 55 is the LCM of 5 and 11
- We need odd numbers, so we skip every other multiple (55×1=55, 55×3=165, etc.)
- Therefore the pattern is 55, 165, 275,... stepping by 110 each time

The output will help identify the unique N and its digit sum that satisfies all conditions.
