This problem involves finding the smallest positive real number x such that there exists a function f satisfying certain conditions, including periodicity (f(x) = f(2001)). The key is to analyze the functional equation and determine the minimal period.

We'll approach this by:
1. Analyzing the functional equation f(3x) = 3f(x)
2. Determining the behavior of f on different intervals
3. Finding the minimal x where f(x) = f(2001)

```python
def compute_min_x():
    # First, find the minimal period where f(x) = f(2001)
    # The functional equation suggests scaling behavior
    n = 2001
    # Factorize 2001 to understand its 3-adic representation
    factors = []
    temp = n
    power_of_3 = 0
    while temp % 3 == 0:
        temp //= 3
        power_of_3 += 1
    remaining_factor = temp
    
    # The minimal x will be related to the remaining factor
    # since 3^k * x = 2001 implies x = 2001/3^k = remaining_factor * 3^{power_of_3 - k}
    # We need to find the minimal x in (0, remaining_factor] that satisfies f(x) = f(remaining_factor)
    
    # The function is defined piecewise on [1,3], so we need to scale remaining_factor into this interval
    k = 0
    while True:
        scaled = remaining_factor / (3 ** k)
        if 1 <= scaled <= 3:
            break
        k += 1
    
    # The minimal x is remaining_factor / 3^k
    min_x = remaining_factor / (3 ** k)
    
    # Verify by checking the function values match
    # The function on [1,3] is f(x) = 1 - |x - 2|
    f_scaled = 1 - abs(scaled - 2)
    f_remaining = f_scaled * (3 ** k)
    
    # Now find where f(x) = f_remaining with minimal x > 0
    # We need to find minimal x where x = remaining_factor / 3^m for some m
    # and f(x) = f_remaining / (3^m)
    # But since f(x) is defined piecewise, we need to find the minimal x where this holds
    
    # The minimal x occurs when we scale down to the [1,3] interval
    print(f"Minimal x found: {min_x}")
    return min_x
