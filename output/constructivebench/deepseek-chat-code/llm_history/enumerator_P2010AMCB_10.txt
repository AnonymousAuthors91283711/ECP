The problem is to find the real number x that satisfies the equation:
(Sum_{n=0}^{98} (n+1) + x) / 101 = 100x

We can solve this by:
1. Calculating the sum of (n+1) from n=0 to 98 (which is 99*100/2 = 4950)
2. Setting up the equation (4950 + x)/101 = 100x
3. Solving for x

The Python program will verify this by:
1. Computing the sum
2. Solving the equation symbolically
3. Printing the exact value of x

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve():
    # Calculate sum of (n+1) for n=0 to 98
    total_sum = sum(n + 1 for n in range(99))
    
    # Set up equation: (total_sum + x)/101 = 100x
    # => total_sum + x = 10100x
    # => total_sum = 10099x
    # => x = total_sum / 10099
    
    # Use Fraction for exact value
    x = Fraction(total_sum, 10099)
    
    # Print exact fraction and decimal approximation
    print(f"x = {x} (exact)")
    print(f"x â‰ˆ {float(x):.10f}")
