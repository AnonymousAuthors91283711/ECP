The problem involves finding a rational number `omnimath383_answer` that satisfies the equation `(1/20)*80 = omnimath383_answer`. This is a simple arithmetic problem where we need to compute the value of the left-hand side expression.

The Python program will compute and print the exact value of `(1/20)*80` as a fraction in its simplest form. Since this is a straightforward calculation, we'll use Python's `fractions` module to handle exact rational arithmetic.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Compute (1/20)*80 as an exact fraction
numerator = 1 * 80
denominator = 20
result = Fraction(numerator, denominator)

# Print the simplified fraction
print(f"The exact value is: {result}")
```
