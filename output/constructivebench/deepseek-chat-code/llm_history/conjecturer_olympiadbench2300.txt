The exact solution is k=34 (but not shown in enumeration due to small max_k). Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Based on the problem statement involving arithmetic and geometric progression conditions, and the hint that k=34 is a solution, the pattern suggests solutions where k-4 is a multiple of 30 (since 34-4=30). This comes from analyzing the progression conditions.
