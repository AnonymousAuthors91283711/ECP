[write_program]
The problem asks to count how many distinct sums can be formed by taking 1, 2, or 3 elements from the set {2, 5, 7, 12, 19, 31, 50, 81}, where each sum is ≤ 100. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible sums and count the distinct ones meeting the criteria.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def main():
    numbers = {2, 5, 7, 12, 19, 31, 50, 81}
    max_sum = 100
    sums = set()
    
    # Generate all combinations of 1, 2, and 3 elements
    for r in range(1, 4):
        for combo in combinations(numbers, r):
            s = sum(combo)
            if s <= max_sum:
                sums.add(s)
    
    # Print all valid sums in sorted order
    for s in sorted(sums):
        print(s)
    
    # Print the count of distinct sums
    print(f"Total distinct sums ≤ {max_sum}: {len(sums)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
