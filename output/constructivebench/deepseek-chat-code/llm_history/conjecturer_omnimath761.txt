Looking at the pattern of the enumerated answers (5,13,25,41,61,85,113,145,181,221,265,313,365,421), we can observe that these are centered square numbers minus 4. The nth centered square number is given by n² + (n-1)². For n=14, this would be 14² + 13² = 196 + 169 = 365, but our answer is 421 which is 14² + 15². Adjusting the formula to match the pattern gives us n² + (n+1)² - 4.

<<<14^2 + 15^2 - 4>>>
