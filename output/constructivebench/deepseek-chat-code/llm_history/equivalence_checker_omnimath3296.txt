Ground Truth Answer: fun n => Nat.Prime n
Proposed Answer: fun _ : ℕ => False
Let me analyze this:

1. The problem is about finding a condition on natural numbers n (where n ≥ 3) that relates to certain properties of functions M and permutations σ.

2. The ground truth answer states that the condition is equivalent to n being a prime number.

3. The proposed answer claims the condition is always false for any natural number n.

4. These cannot be equivalent because:
   - For prime numbers n, the ground truth says the statement holds (true), while the proposed answer says it's always false
   - There exist prime numbers ≥3 (e.g., 3,5,7,...) where the ground truth would be true but the proposed answer would be false

5. The proposed answer is clearly incorrect as it contradicts the ground truth for all prime numbers.

<<<False>>>
