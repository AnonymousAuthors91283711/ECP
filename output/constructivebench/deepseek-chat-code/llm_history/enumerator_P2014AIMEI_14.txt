[write_program]
The problem asks to find the greatest real number x (not equal to 3,5,17,19) satisfying a given equation, and express it in the form a + sqrt(b + sqrt(c)) where a,b,c are positive integers summing to 263. We'll write a program to search for such numbers.

```python
import math

def check_equation(x):
    if x in {3,5,17,19}:
        return False
    lhs = 3/(x-3) + 5/(x-5) + 17/(x-17) + 19/(x-19)
    rhs = x**2 - 11*x - 4
    return abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-8

def find_solution():
    # Search for x in form a + sqrt(b + sqrt(c))
    for a in range(1, 20):
        for b in range(1, 200):
            for c in range(1, 200):
                if a + b + c != 263:
                    continue
                x = a + math.sqrt(b + math.sqrt(c))
                if check_equation(x):
                    print(f"Found solution: x = {a} + sqrt({b} + sqrt({c}))")
                    return
    print("No solution found")

find_solution()
```
