The problem is to solve the equation `5 * log₂ x = 40` for positive real x. We need to find the exact value of x that satisfies this equation. The solution involves basic logarithmic properties and exponentiation.

Here's a Python program that computes and prints the exact value of x:

```python
import math

# Solve 5 * log2(x) = 40 => log2(x) = 8 => x = 2^8
x = 2 ** 8
print(x)
```

The program directly computes the solution by:
1. Dividing both sides by 5 to get log₂(x) = 8
2. Converting the logarithmic equation to its exponential form x = 2⁸
3. Calculating and printing the exact value 256

The output will be:
256
