[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of two real equations with variables x and y. We'll write a Python program to numerically search for solutions (x,y) that satisfy both equations. The approach will be to:
1. Iterate over possible x and y values in a reasonable range
2. Check if both equations are satisfied within a small tolerance
3. Print any found solutions

```python
import numpy as np

def check_equations(x, y, tol=1e-6):
    if abs(x) < tol or abs(y) < tol:  # avoid division by zero
        return False
    # First equation: 1/x + 1/(2y) == (x² + 3y²)(3x² + y²)
    eq1_left = 1/x + 1/(2*y)
    eq1_right = (x**2 + 3*y**2) * (3*x**2 + y**2)
    # Second equation: 1/x - 1/(2y) == 2(y⁴ - x⁴)
    eq2_left = 1/x - 1/(2*y)
    eq2_right = 2*(y**4 - x**4)
    
    return (abs(eq1_left - eq1_right) < tol and 
            abs(eq2_left - eq2_right) < tol)

def find_solutions():
    # Search in a reasonable range with small step size
    step = 0.01
    for x in np.arange(-1.0, 1.0, step):
        for y in np.arange(-1.0, 1.0, step):
            if check_equations(x, y):
                print(f"Found solution: x = {x:.4f}, y = {y:.4f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solutions()
```
[refine_program]
Let me analyze the program and its behavior:

Judgement:
1. The program attempts to solve a system of two real equations by brute-force searching over a grid in [-1,1]×[-1,1] with step size 0.01.
2. The equations involve rational terms (1/x, 1/y) and polynomials, which can have solutions near zero where the functions become singular.
3. The program correctly avoids division by zero with the `tol` check.
4. The main issue is that the search range [-1,1] might be too narrow and the step size too coarse to find solutions. The equations likely have solutions outside this range or require more precise stepping.
5. The program follows all requirements (streaming results, no hardcoding, etc.) but fails to find any solutions due to parameter choices.

The program is structurally correct but ineffective due to poor parameter choices. Since it doesn't violate any requirements but simply fails to find solutions, I'll accept it with improvements to make it actually find solutions.

<<<False>>>

Here's a corrected version with better search parameters and symmetry exploitation:

```python
import numpy as np

def check_equations(x, y, tol=1e-6):
    if abs(x) < tol or abs(y) < tol:
        return False
    eq1 = abs(1/x + 1/(2*y) - (x**2 + 3*y**2)*(3*x**2 + y**2))
    eq2 = abs(1/x - 1/(2*y) - 2*(y**4 - x**4))
    return eq1 < tol and eq2 < tol

def find_solutions():
    # Search in a wider range with adaptive steps
    for s in [0.1, 0.01]:  # Try coarse then fine search
        for x in np.arange(-2.0, 2.0, s):
            for y in np.arange(-2.0, 2.0, s):
                if check_equations(x, y):
                    print(f"Solution: x = {x:.6f}, y = {y:.6f}")
                    return  # Stop after first solution
        print(f"No solutions found with step {s}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solutions()
```

Key improvements:
1. Wider search range (-2 to 2
