The problem asks for the sum of the digits of the number obtained by multiplying 11, 101, 111, and 110011. We'll compute this product and then sum its digits in Python.

To solve this:
1. Calculate the product of the given numbers
2. Convert the result to a string to access each digit
3. Sum all the digits

Here's the Python program:

```python
# Calculate the product of 11, 101, 111, and 110011
product = 11 * 101 * 111 * 110011

# Convert the product to a string to access each digit
product_str = str(product)

# Calculate the sum of all digits
digit_sum = sum(int(d) for d in product_str)

# Output the result
print(f"The sum of digits is: {digit_sum}")
```
