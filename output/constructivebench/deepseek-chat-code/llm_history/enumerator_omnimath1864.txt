[write_program]
The problem asks to count numbers n between 1 and 50 where the number of positive divisors of the number of positive divisors of n is odd. We need to write a Python program to enumerate these numbers.

Key observations:
1. τ(n) counts positive divisors of n
2. We need τ(τ(n)) to be odd
3. A number has odd number of divisors iff it's a perfect square
4. So we need τ(n) to be a perfect square

The program will:
1. Compute τ(n) for each n from 1 to 50
2. Check if τ(n) is a perfect square
3. Count and print qualifying numbers

```python
import math

def count_divisors(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    count = 2  # 1 and n
    sqrt_n = int(math.sqrt(n))
    for i in range(2, sqrt_n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1 if i*i == n else 2
    return count

def is_perfect_square(m):
    s = int(math.sqrt(m))
    return s*s == m

qualifying_numbers = []
for n in range(1, 51):
    tau_n = count_divisors(n)
    if is_perfect_square(tau_n):
        qualifying_numbers.append(n)
        print(f"Found: {n} (τ(n)={tau_n})")

print(f"\nTotal count: {len(qualifying_numbers)}")
print("Qualifying numbers:", qualifying_numbers)
```
