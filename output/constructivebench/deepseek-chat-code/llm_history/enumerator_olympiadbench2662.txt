[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer N such that:
1. 14 divides 20*N
2. 20 divides 14*N

We'll write a Python program to find the smallest N satisfying both conditions by checking numbers sequentially until we find the first valid one.

```python
def find_min_N():
    N = 1
    while True:
        # Check both divisibility conditions
        if (20 * N) % 14 == 0 and (14 * N) % 20 == 0:
            print(f"Found valid N: {N}")
            print(f"Minimum N is: {N}")
            return
        N += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_N()
```

The program starts checking from N=1 and increments until it finds the smallest N where both conditions are satisfied. It prints the first valid N it finds (which will be the minimum) and then terminates. The conditions are checked using modulo operations to verify divisibility.
