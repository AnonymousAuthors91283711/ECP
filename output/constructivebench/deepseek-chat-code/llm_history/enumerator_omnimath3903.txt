[write_program]
This problem asks for natural numbers n > 0 where the cube of the number of divisors equals 4n. We'll write a Python program to search for such numbers up to a reasonable threshold.

The approach:
1. Iterate through numbers n from 1 to 10,000
2. For each n, calculate its number of divisors
3. Check if the cube of this count equals 4n
4. Print any numbers that satisfy this condition

```python
import math

def count_divisors(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    count = 2  # 1 and n
    sqrt_n = int(math.sqrt(n))
    for i in range(2, sqrt_n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i == n // i:
                count += 1
            else:
                count += 2
    return count

max_n = 10000
print(f"Searching for numbers n where d(n)^3 = 4n, up to n={max_n}:")
for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    d = count_divisors(n)
    if d ** 3 == 4 * n:
        print(f"Found solution: n = {n} (d(n) = {d})")
```
