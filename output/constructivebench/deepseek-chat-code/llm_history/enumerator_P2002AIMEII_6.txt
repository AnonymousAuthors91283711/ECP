This problem involves finding the value that best approximates a given infinite series when truncated at 9998 terms. The series is of the form 1/((n+3)^2 - 4). We'll compute partial sums and look for convergence patterns.

The approach is to:
1. Compute the partial sum for n from 0 to 9997 (since range 9998 gives 0..9997)
2. Multiply by 1000 as specified
3. Observe the convergence pattern to identify the limiting value

```python
def compute_partial_sum(terms):
    """Compute 1000 * sum_{n=0}^{terms-1} 1/((n+3)^2 - 4)"""
    total = 0.0
    for n in range(terms):
        denominator = (n + 3)**2 - 4
        term = 1.0 / denominator
        total += term
    return 1000 * total

# Compute for increasing numbers of terms to observe convergence
for terms in [100, 1000, 5000, 9998]:
    result = compute_partial_sum(terms)
    print(f"Terms: {terms}, 1000*partial_sum: {result:.15f}")

# The final answer we're interested in is with terms=9998
final_result = compute_partial_sum(9998)
print("\nFinal approximation:", final_result)
```
