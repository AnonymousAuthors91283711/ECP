Ground Truth Answer: 10
Proposed Answer: 1006
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal value s where:
   - We have two arithmetic sequences a and b with constant differences da and db
   - All terms of a and b are distinct (a_i ≠ b_j for any i,j)
   - a₂₀ + b₁₄ = 1000
   - b₂₀ + a₁₄ = s
   - We need to find the minimal possible s

2. The ground truth answer is 10, while the proposed answer is 1006.

3. Let's think about the sequences:
   - a_n = a₀ + n*da
   - b_n = b₀ + n*db
   - The given conditions become:
     a₀ + 20da + b₀ + 14db = 1000
     b₀ + 20db + a₀ + 14da = s

4. Subtracting these equations gives:
   (6da - 6db) = 1000 - s
   => s = 1000 - 6(da - db)

5. To minimize s, we need to maximize (da - db). However, we have the constraint that all a_i ≠ b_j.

6. The ground truth answer 10 suggests da - db = 165 (since 1000 - 6*165 = 10). This is indeed possible with carefully chosen a₀ and b₀ to ensure all terms are distinct.

7. The proposed answer 1006 would require da - db = -1 (since 1000 - 6*(-1) = 1006). While this satisfies the equation, it's not the minimal possible s.

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't give the minimal possible s. The correct minimal s is indeed 10.
