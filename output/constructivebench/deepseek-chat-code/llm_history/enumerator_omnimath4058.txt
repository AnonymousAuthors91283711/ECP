[write_program]
This problem involves finding a sequence of natural numbers (n_k) where each term is at least 1, and the product of a specific expression involving these terms equals a power of 11. We'll write a Python program to search for small sequences that satisfy the condition.

The approach:
1. Consider small constant sequences (all n_k equal)
2. For each constant value c, compute the product expression
3. Check if the result is a power of 11
4. We'll limit our search to small values (c ≤ 10) and small sequence lengths (≤5) for demonstration

```python
def is_power_of_11(x):
    if x == 1:
        return True
    while x % 11 == 0:
        x = x // 11
    return x == 1

def compute_product(c, length):
    # For constant sequence n_k = c for all k
    # Each term in product becomes c^2020 + c^2019 = c^2019*(c + 1)
    term = (c**2019) * (c + 1)
    return term ** length

def search_constant_sequences(max_c=10, max_length=5):
    for c in range(1, max_c + 1):
        for length in range(1, max_length + 1):
            product = compute_product(c, length)
            if is_power_of_11(product):
                print(f"Found solution: constant sequence n_k = {c} with length {length}")
                print(f"Product = {product} = 11^{int(round(product**(1/11)))}")  # Approximation for display

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Searching for constant sequences where product is power of 11...")
    search_constant_sequences()
```
