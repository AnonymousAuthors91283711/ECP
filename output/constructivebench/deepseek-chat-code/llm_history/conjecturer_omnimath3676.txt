theorem omnimath3676 (k : ℕ) (hk : 2 ≤ k) (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ (x : Fin k → ℕ), (∑ i, (f (x i))!) ∣ (∑ i, (x i)!)) ↔ f = omnimath3676_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: f(0) = 0
f(1) = 0
Could not determine f(2)
Could not determine f(3)
Could not determine f(4)
Could not determine f(5)

Current f: {0: 0, 1: 0}. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Based on the pattern from the enumerated answers (f(0)=0, f(1)=0) and the problem's divisibility condition involving factorials, the most likely solution is the function that maps all inputs to 0, since 0! = 1 and 0 divides any sum.
