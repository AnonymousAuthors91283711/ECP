. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Looking at the problem, we need to find the sum of a geometric series with 6033 terms, given two conditions about partial sums. The key is to first solve for the common ratio r and initial term a using the given conditions.

From the first condition (sum to 2011 terms = 200), we have:
a(1 - r^2011)/(1 - r) = 200

From the second condition (sum to 4022 terms = 380), we have:
a(1 - r^4022)/(1 - r) = 380

Dividing the second equation by the first gives:
(1 - r^4022)/(1 - r^2011) = 380/200 = 19/10

This simplifies to a quadratic in r^2011. Solving gives r^2011 = 9/19.

Now for the desired sum (6033 terms):
a(1 - r^6033)/(1 - r) = (200*(1 - r^6033))/(1 - r^2011)

Substituting r^2011 = 9/19 gives:
200*(1 - (9/19)^3)/(1 - 9/19) = 200*(1 - 729/6859)/(10/19) = 200*(6130/6859)*(19/10) = 200*613/361 = 122600/361

Here's the corrected Lean expression:

<<<122600 / 361>>>
