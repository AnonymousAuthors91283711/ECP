Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∀ p : ℕ, p.Prime → p ∣ n → p % 4 = 1}
Proposed Answer: {n | ∃ k : ℕ, n = k^2 + (k+1)^2}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for natural numbers n that satisfy certain conditions involving gcd and a triple (a,b,c).

2. The ground truth answer states that n must be positive and all its prime factors must be congruent to 1 modulo 4.

3. The proposed answer gives numbers that are sums of two consecutive squares (k² + (k+1)²).

Analysis:
- Numbers that are sums of two consecutive squares are always odd and have all prime factors ≡ 1 mod 4 (this is a known number theory result).
- However, not all numbers with all prime factors ≡ 1 mod 4 can be expressed as sums of two consecutive squares (e.g., 5×13=65 is in ground truth but not in proposed answer since 65 ≠ k²+(k+1)² for any k).
- Therefore, the proposed answer is a proper subset of the ground truth answer.

Conclusion: The answers are not equivalent, but the proposed answer is partially correct (it gives some valid solutions but not all).
