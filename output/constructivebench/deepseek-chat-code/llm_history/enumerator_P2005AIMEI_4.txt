[write_program]
This problem asks for the largest natural number n that can be expressed both as kÂ² + 5 for some k and as m*(m+7) for some m. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of n up to a reasonable threshold and find the maximum such n.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible values of m
2. For each m, compute n = m*(m+7)
3. Check if n-5 is a perfect square
4. Track the largest n that satisfies both conditions

We'll limit our search to m values up to 1000, which gives n values up to about 1,000,000 - more than sufficient for this problem.

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(x):
    s = int(math.isqrt(x))
    return s * s == x

max_n = 0
for m in range(1, 1001):
    n = m * (m + 7)
    if is_perfect_square(n - 5):
        print(f"Found valid n: {n} (m={m}, k={int(math.sqrt(n-5))})")
        if n > max_n:
            max_n = n

print(f"The largest such n is: {max_n}")
```
