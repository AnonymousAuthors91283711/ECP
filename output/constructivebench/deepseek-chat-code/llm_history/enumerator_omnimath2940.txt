[write_program]
The problem asks to count the number of natural numbers less than 1000 that can be expressed as the product of squares of two distinct primes (i.e., numbers of the form p²q² where p and q are distinct primes). We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such numbers below 1000 and count them.

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]:
        if n % p == 0:
            return n == p
    d = n - 1
    s = 0
    while d % 2 == 0:
        d //= 2
        s += 1
    for a in [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]:
        if a >= n:
            continue
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(s - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False
    return True

primes = [p for p in range(2, 32) if is_prime(p)]
results = set()

for i in range(len(primes)):
    p = primes[i]
    p_sq = p * p
    for j in range(i + 1, len(primes)):
        q = primes[j]
        q_sq = q * q
        n = p_sq * q_sq
        if n < 1000:
            results.add(n)
            print(n)

print(f"Total count: {len(results)}")
```
