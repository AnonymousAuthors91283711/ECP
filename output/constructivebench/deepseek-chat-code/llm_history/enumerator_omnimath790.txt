[write_program]
This problem asks for all real numbers x between 0 and 2π where sin(x) + cos(x) = √2. We'll write a Python program to numerically find these solutions.

The key insight is that sin(x) + cos(x) can be rewritten as √2 * sin(x + π/4). The equation then simplifies to sin(x + π/4) = 1, which has solutions at x + π/4 = π/2 + 2πk for integer k. We'll verify this numerically.

```python
import math

def find_solutions():
    solutions = []
    # We know the exact solution is x = π/4 + 2πk, but we'll search numerically
    for x in [i * 0.0001 for i in range(int(2 * math.pi * 10000))]:
        if abs(math.sin(x) + math.cos(x) - math.sqrt(2)) < 1e-6:
            solutions.append(x)
            print(f"Found solution: {x}")
    
    # Remove duplicates (due to floating point precision)
    unique_solutions = []
    prev = -1
    for x in solutions:
        if abs(x - prev) > 1e-4:
            unique_solutions.append(x)
            prev = x
    
    print("\nUnique solutions in [0, 2π):")
    for x in unique_solutions:
        print(f"{x:.4f} (exact: {math.pi/4:.4f})")

find_solutions()
```
