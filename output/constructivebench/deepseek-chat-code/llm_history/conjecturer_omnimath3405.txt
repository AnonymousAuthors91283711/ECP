From the enumerated answers, the simplest patterns are linear functions that preserve the odd/even condition. The most straightforward solution that satisfies `Odd (f x)` when `3x+1` is even is simply `x` itself, since:
- If `3x+1` is even, then `x` must be odd (since 3*odd+1=even, 3*even+1=odd)
- Therefore `x` is odd as required
