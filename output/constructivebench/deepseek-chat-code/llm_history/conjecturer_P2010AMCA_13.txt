abbrev P2010AMCA_13_answer : ℤ → ℕ := sorry
theorem P2010AMCA_13 (k : ℤ) :
  Disjoint {(x, y) : ℝ × ℝ | x^2 + y^2 = k^2} {(x, y) : ℝ × ℝ | x * y = k} ↔ 
  P2010AMCA_13_answer k = 2 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking for which integer k the curves are disjoint:
k=-5: Intersects
k=-4: Intersects
k=-3: Intersects
k=-2: Intersects
k=-1: Disjoint
k=0: Disjoint
k=1: Disjoint
k=2: Intersects
k=3: Intersects
k=4: Intersects
k=5: Intersects

Testing non-integer k=1.9 (should intersect):
k=1.9: Disjoint
k=2.1 (should be disjoint):
k=2.1: Intersects. Expected Answer Type: ℤ → ℕ
<<<fun k : ℤ => if k = -1 ∨ k = 0 ∨ k = 1 then 2 else 1>>>
