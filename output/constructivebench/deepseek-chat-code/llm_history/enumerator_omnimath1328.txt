This problem involves finding real numbers a and b such that a non-real complex root of z³=343 satisfies a quadratic equation with coefficients a and b. The cube roots of 343 are 7 and two complex roots. We'll enumerate possible a and b values by considering the complex roots.

```python
import cmath

def find_ab():
    # The cube roots of 343
    roots = [7, 
             cmath.rect(7, 2*cmath.pi/3), 
             cmath.rect(7, 4*cmath.pi/3)]
    
    # Only consider non-real roots
    non_real_roots = [z for z in roots if z.imag != 0]
    
    for z in non_real_roots:
        # For quadratic X² + aX + b = 0, sum is -a and product is b
        # Since complex roots come in conjugate pairs, we can use Vieta's formulas
        # The other root must be the complex conjugate
        z_conj = z.conjugate()
        a = -(z + z_conj)
        b = z * z_conj
        
        # Since a and b should be real, we verify and print exact values
        if abs(a.imag) < 1e-10 and abs(b.imag) < 1e-10:
            a_real = a.real
            b_real = b.real
            print(f"Found solution: a = {a_real}, b = {b_real}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_ab()
```

The program calculates the non-real cube roots of 343, then uses Vieta's formulas to determine the coefficients a and b that would make these roots satisfy the quadratic equation. The output shows the exact real values of a and b that satisfy the conditions.
