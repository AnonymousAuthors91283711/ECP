This problem involves solving a logarithmic equation with variable bases. We'll write a Python program to numerically search for the solution by evaluating both sides of the equation for different x values within a reasonable range.

The approach:
1. Define the left and right sides of the equation as functions
2. Search for x where the difference between sides is minimal
3. Use logarithmic identities to simplify computations
4. Search in the range (0, 5) with small increments

```python
import math

def left_side(x):
    if x <= 0 or x == 0.5 or x >= 1/3 and x <= 1/3 + 1e-10:
        return float('nan')
    numerator = math.log(48 * 3**(1/3))
    denominator = math.log(2 * x)
    return numerator / denominator

def right_side(x):
    if x <= 0 or x == 1/3 or x >= 0.5 and x <= 0.5 + 1e-10:
        return float('nan')
    numerator = math.log(162 * 2**(1/3))
    denominator = math.log(3 * x)
    return numerator / denominator

def difference(x):
    l = left_side(x)
    r = right_side(x)
    if math.isnan(l) or math.isnan(r):
        return float('inf')
    return abs(l - r)

# Search for x that minimizes the difference between sides
min_diff = float('inf')
best_x = None
step = 0.0001
start = 0.01
end = 5.0

for x in [start + i*step for i in range(int((end-start)/step))]:
    current_diff = difference(x)
    if current_diff < min_diff:
        min_diff = current_diff
        best_x = x
        print(f"Current best x: {x:.6f}, difference: {current_diff:.10f}")
        if current_diff < 1e-10:
            break

print(f"\nFinal result: x â‰ˆ {best_x:.10f}")
```
