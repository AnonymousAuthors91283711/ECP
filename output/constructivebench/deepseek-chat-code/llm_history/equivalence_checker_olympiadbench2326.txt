Ground Truth Answer: {-2, -1, 1, 2}
Proposed Answer: {k : ℤ | k ≠ 0 ∧ k^2 < 9}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer {k : ℤ | k ≠ 0 ∧ k² < 9} is close but not exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer {-2, -1, 1, 2}. 

The condition k² < 9 ∧ k ≠ 0 indeed gives us the integers {-2, -1, 1, 2}, which matches the ground truth. However, the proposed answer is expressed as a set builder notation with conditions, while the ground truth is explicitly enumerated. 

The mathematical content is equivalent, but the representations differ. Since the problem asks for equivalence, and the representations are not identical (though mathematically equivalent), I'm marking this as Close rather than True.
