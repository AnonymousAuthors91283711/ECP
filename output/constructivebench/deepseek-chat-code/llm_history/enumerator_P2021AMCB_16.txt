This problem involves finding a polynomial g(x) whose roots are the reciprocals of the roots of f(x) = x³ + a x² + b x + c, and evaluating g(1). The answer will be a function of a, b, c.

We'll:
1. Construct f(x) from parameters a, b, c
2. Find g(x) by reversing coefficients (standard reciprocal polynomial construction)
3. Compute g(1) symbolically
4. Print the formula for different parameter values

```python
def compute_g1(a, b, c):
    # g(x) = x³f(1/x) = x³(1/x³ + a/x² + b/x + c) = 1 + a x + b x² + c x³
    # So g(1) = 1 + a + b + c
    return 1 + a + b + c

# Test with sample parameters satisfying 1 < a < b < c
test_cases = [
    (2, 3, 4),
    (1.5, 2.5, 3.5),
    (2, 4, 6),
    (1.1, 1.2, 1.3)
]

for a, b, c in test_cases:
    print(f"For a={a}, b={b}, c={c}: g(1) = {compute_g1(a, b, c)}")

# The pattern clearly shows g(1) = 1 + a + b + c for all cases
```
