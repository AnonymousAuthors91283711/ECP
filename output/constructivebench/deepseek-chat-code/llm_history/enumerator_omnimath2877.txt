The problem asks to evaluate the expression `√(16 * √16)`. We can compute this numerically and symbolically to find the exact value. The exact value can be simplified using properties of square roots and exponents.

Here's a Python program that computes both the exact symbolic form and numerical approximation:

```python
import math

# Compute the exact value symbolically
sqrt_16 = 4  # √16 = 4
inner_product = 16 * sqrt_16
result = math.sqrt(inner_product)

# Print the exact form and numerical approximation
print(f"√(16 * √16) = √(16 * 4) = √64 = 8")
print(f"Numerical approximation: {result}")
```

The program first computes √16 which is exactly 4, then calculates 16 * 4 = 64, and finally takes √64 which is exactly 8. The numerical approximation confirms this exact result. The output shows both the step-by-step simplification and the final value.

The exact value is 8, which can be verified by the computation:
√(16 * √16) = √(16 * 4) = √64 = 8
