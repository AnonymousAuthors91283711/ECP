theorem IMO2017SLN4 :
  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | ∃ m : ℕ, 0 < m ∧ n = Nat.card {t : ℕ | ∃ c ∈ Icc 1 2017, 
    (∀ k < t, ¬∃ d : ℕ, (10^k - 1) / (c * m) = d) ∧ 
    ∃ d : ℕ, (10^t - 1) / (c * m) = d}} 
  IMO2017SLN4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: New max n=63 found at m=1
New max n=65 found at m=3
Final maximum n found: 65. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
