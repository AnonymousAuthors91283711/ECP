[write_program]
This problem involves finding the greatest integer k such that for some N â‰¥ 3, there exist non-negative integers r, w, b with r + w + b = N, k = N//3, and the probability (r*w*b)*6/(N*(N-1)*(N-2)) > 23/100. We'll write a Python program to search for such k values by enumerating possible N values and checking the conditions.

The approach is:
1. Iterate N from 3 upwards
2. For each N, compute k = N//3
3. Find possible r,w,b combinations that sum to N and satisfy the probability condition
4. Track the maximum k found that satisfies the conditions

```python
def find_max_k():
    max_k = 0
    # We'll search up to N=100 which should be sufficient
    for N in range(3, 101):
        k = N // 3
        if k <= max_k:
            continue  # No need to check smaller k values
        
        # We need r*w*b > (23/100)*N*(N-1)*(N-2)/6
        target = (23/100) * N * (N-1) * (N-2) / 6
        found = False
        
        # Try all possible r values from 1 to N-2
        for r in range(1, N-1):
            if found:
                break
            # Try all possible w values from 1 to N-r-1
            for w in range(1, N - r):
                b = N - r - w
                if b < 1:
                    continue
                product = r * w * b
                if product > target:
                    print(f"For N={N}, found valid (r,w,b)=({r},{w},{b}) with k={k}")
                    max_k = k
                    found = True
                    break
        
    print(f"Maximum k found: {max_k}")

find_max_k()
