This problem asks for all positive real-valued functions f defined on positive reals that satisfy a functional equation involving exponents and multiplication. We'll approach it by testing simple function forms (like power functions) that might satisfy the equation.

The functional equation is: f(x²⁰²³ + f(x)f(y)) = x²⁰²³ + y f(x) for all x,y > 0.

We'll test power functions of the form f(x) = kxⁿ where k > 0 and n is real. We'll try to find k and n that satisfy the equation.

```python
def test_power_function(k, n):
    """Check if f(x) = k*x^n satisfies the functional equation."""
    # We'll test at specific points since testing symbolically is complex
    test_points = [(1.0, 2.0), (2.0, 3.0), (0.5, 4.0)]
    for x, y in test_points:
        lhs = k * (x**2023 + (k*x**n)*(k*y**n))**n
        rhs = x**2023 + y * (k*x**n)
        if not abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-6:  # Allow small floating point error
            return False
    return True

# Search for possible exponents n and coefficients k
print("Testing power functions f(x) = k*x^n:")
for n in [0, 0.5, 1, 2022/2023, 1.0, 2023.0]:
    for k in [0.5, 1.0, 2.0]:
        if k <= 0:
            continue
        if test_power_function(k, n):
            print(f"Found candidate: f(x) = {k}*x^{n}")

# Also test constant functions
print("\nTesting constant functions f(x) = c:")
for c in [0.5, 1.0, 2.0]:
    # For constant functions, the equation becomes:
    # c = x^2023 + y*c for all x,y > 0, which is impossible unless c=0
    # But c=0 is invalid since f(x) > 0
    pass  # No constant functions satisfy the condition

# Test linear functions more thoroughly
print("\nTesting linear functions f(x) = k*x:")
for k in [i/10 for i in range(1, 21)]:
    if test_power_function(k, 1.0):
        print(f"Found candidate: f(x) = {k}*x")

# The only solution appears to be f(x) = x
```
