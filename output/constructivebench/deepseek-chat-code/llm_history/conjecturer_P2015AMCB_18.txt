Collected sums up to n = 100 :
[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 31, 32, 33, 34, 39, 43, 45, 49]. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{n | 4 ≤ n} \ {1, 2, 3, 29, 30, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 44, 46, 47, 48}>>> 

Explanation: The enumerated sums show all integers ≥4 except some primes (like 29) and certain composite numbers (like 35=5×7 but 5+7=12 is already included). The pattern suggests all natural numbers ≥4 except those that can't be expressed as sums of prime factors of composite numbers.
