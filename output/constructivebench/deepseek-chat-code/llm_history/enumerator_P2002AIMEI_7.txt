This problem asks for the first three digits of the fractional part of (10^2002 + 1)^(10/7). Since directly computing this is infeasible, we'll use logarithms to approximate the value and find its fractional part.

The approach is:
1. Compute the logarithm of the expression
2. Separate into integer and fractional parts
3. Reconstruct the original value using the fractional part
4. Extract the first three digits after the decimal point

We'll implement this in Python using high-precision floating-point arithmetic (via the decimal module) to get accurate results.

```python
from decimal import Decimal, getcontext

def solve():
    getcontext().prec = 100  # Set high precision
    
    # Problem parameters
    exponent = Decimal(10) / Decimal(7)
    large_num = Decimal(10)**2002 + 1
    
    # Compute log10 of the expression
    log_val = exponent * large_num.log10()
    
    # Separate into integer and fractional parts
    int_part = log_val.to_integral_value(rounding="FLOOR")
    frac_part = log_val - int_part
    
    # Reconstruct the original value's fractional part
    fractional_part = Decimal(10)**frac_part - 1
    
    # Get first three digits after decimal
    first_three = int(fractional_part * 1000)
    
    print(f"First three digits of fractional part: {first_three:03d}")

solve()
```
[refine_program]
Judgement:
The original program is rejected because:
1. It doesn't output any results (empty output)
2. The mathematical approach is incorrect - it tries to use logarithms but doesn't properly handle the fractional part calculation
3. The precision settings may be insufficient for this large calculation
4. The program doesn't follow the streaming partial results requirement

The correct approach should:
1. Use exact arithmetic where possible
2. Handle the extremely large numbers involved (10^2002) carefully
3. Compute the fractional part directly without logarithms
4. Output intermediate results if possible

<<<False>>>

```python
from decimal import Decimal, getcontext

def solve():
    getcontext().prec = 4000  # Need extremely high precision for 10^2002
    
    # Problem parameters
    exponent = Decimal(10) / Decimal(7)
    base = Decimal(10)**2002 + 1
    
    # Compute (10^2002 + 1)^(10/7)
    # Using logarithms would lose precision, so we compute directly
    # Since we only need fractional part, we can compute modulo 1
    # Using the binomial approximation: (1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + n*x for small x
    
    # Here x = 10^-2002, so (1 + x)^(10/7) ≈ 1 + (10/7)*x
    fractional_part = (Decimal(10)/Decimal(7)) * (Decimal(1)/Decimal(10)**2002)
    
    # Get first three digits after decimal
    first_three = int(fractional_part * 1000)
    
    print(f"First three digits of fractional part: {first_three:03d}")
