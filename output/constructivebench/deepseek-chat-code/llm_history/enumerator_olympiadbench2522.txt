[write_program]
This problem involves finding time allocations t₁ and t₂ for paddling and swimming in a round trip scenario. The program will enumerate possible time allocations that satisfy the given constraints, using the specific parameter values provided (paddle_speed=7, swim_speed=2, total_time=1.5).

```python
def main():
    paddle_speed = 7
    swim_speed = 2
    total_time = 1.5
    
    # We'll search for t1 and t2 in increments of 0.01 hours (36 seconds)
    step = 0.01
    solutions = []
    
    for t1 in [i * step for i in range(int(total_time / step) + 1)]:
        for t2 in [i * step for i in range(int(total_time / step) + 1)]:
            # Check all constraints
            if (0 <= t1 <= total_time and 0 <= t2 <= total_time and
                abs(paddle_speed * t1 + swim_speed * (total_time - t1) - 
                    swim_speed * t2 + paddle_speed * (total_time - t2)) < 1e-6 and
                abs(paddle_speed * t1 - swim_speed * t2) < 1e-6):
                
                answer_minutes = 60 * (total_time - (t1 + (total_time - t2)))
                solutions.append((t1, t2, answer_minutes))
                print(f"Found solution: t1={t1:.2f}, t2={t2:.2f}, answer={answer_minutes:.2f} minutes")
    
    if solutions:
        print("\nAll valid solutions found:")
        for sol in solutions:
            print(f"t1={sol[0]:.2f}, t2={sol[1]:.2f}, answer={sol[2]:.2f} minutes")
    else:
        print("No solutions found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
