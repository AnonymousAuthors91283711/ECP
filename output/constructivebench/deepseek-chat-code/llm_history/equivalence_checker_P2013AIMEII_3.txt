theorem P2013AIMEII_3 :
  let totalTime := ∑ k in Finset.range 119, 10 * (k + 1)
  let halfTime := totalTime / 2
  let heightAtHalfTime := 119 - (Finset.card {k ∈ Finset.range 119 | ∑ i in Finset.range k, 10 * (i + 1) ≤ halfTime})
  10 * heightAtHalfTime = P2013AIMEII_3_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 35
Proposed Answer: 350
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating the height at half time of a process where each step takes 10*(k+1) seconds for k from 0 to 118 (total 119 steps).

2. The ground truth answer is 35, which appears to be the step number (k value) at the halfway point.

3. The proposed answer is 350, which is exactly 10 times the ground truth answer (35 * 10 = 350).

4. Looking at the theorem statement, we see the final comparison is `10 * heightAtHalfTime = P2013AIMEII_3_answer`. This means the ground truth answer is the heightAtHalfTime itself (35), while the proposed answer is the multiplied version (350).

5. The proposed answer is actually what the theorem is proving should equal P2013AIMEII_3_answer, not the value of heightAtHalfTime itself.

<<<True>>>
The answers are equivalent because the proposed answer (350) is exactly what the theorem states should be the value (10 * heightAtHalfTime), where heightAtHalfTime is 35. The ground truth answer is just the heightAtHalfTime before multiplication by 10.
