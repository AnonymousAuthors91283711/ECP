This problem involves solving a simple linear equation to find the value of x, then using that to compute another expression. We'll solve it step by step in Python.

The first equation is (x/100)*60 = 12, which simplifies to x = 12*100/60 = 20. Then we need to compute (15/100)*x which equals (15/100)*20 = 3.

```python
# Solve the equation (x/100)*60 = 12 for x
x = 12 * 100 / 60
print(f"x = {x}")

# Compute the final answer (15/100)*x
answer = (15 / 100) * x
print(f"Answer = {answer}")
```
