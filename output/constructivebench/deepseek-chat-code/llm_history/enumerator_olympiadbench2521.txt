The problem asks to find the area of a right triangle with sides a, b, c (a < b < c) that forms an arithmetic progression (b - a = c - b) and has one of its sides equal to 60. The area is given by A = (a * b)/2.

We'll enumerate possible arithmetic sequences and check the Pythagorean condition. Since the sides are in arithmetic progression, we can express them as (a, a+d, a+2d). The Pythagorean theorem gives us a² + (a+d)² = (a+2d)². We'll solve this equation and then check cases where each side equals 60.

```python
def find_triangles():
    # We'll check for cases where a, b, or c is 60
    # Case 1: a = 60
    a = 60
    # From arithmetic progression: b = a + d, c = a + 2d
    # From Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c²
    # Substitute: 60² + (60+d)² = (60+2d)²
    # Expand and simplify: 3600 + 3600 + 120d + d² = 3600 + 240d + 4d²
    # Simplify further: 7200 + 120d + d² = 3600 + 240d + 4d²
    # Bring all terms to one side: 3600 - 120d - 3d² = 0
    # Divide by 3: 1200 - 40d - d² = 0
    # Rearrange: d² + 40d - 1200 = 0
    # Solve quadratic equation: d = [-40 ± sqrt(1600 + 4800)]/2
    discriminant = 40**2 + 4*1200
    d1 = (-40 + discriminant**0.5)/2
    d2 = (-40 - discriminant**0.5)/2
    # We need d > 0 for b > a and c > b
    if d1 > 0:
        b = a + d1
        area = a * b / 2
        print(f"Case a=60: area = {area}")
    if d2 > 0:
        b = a + d2
        area = a * b / 2
        print(f"Case a=60: area = {area}")

    # Case 2: b = 60
    b = 60
    # From arithmetic progression: a = b - d, c = b + d
    # From Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c²
    # Substitute: (60-d)² + 60² = (60+d)²
    # Expand: 3600 - 120d + d² + 3600 = 3600 + 120d + d²
    # Simplify: 7200 - 120d = 3600 + 120d
    # 3600 = 240d => d = 15
    d = 15
    a = b - d
    c = b + d
    if a > 0 and a < b < c:
        area = a * b / 2
        print(f"Case b=60: area = {area}")

    # Case 3: c = 60
    c = 60
    # From arithmetic progression: a = c - 2d, b = c - d
    # From Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c²
    # Substitute: (60-2d)² + (60-d)² = 60²
    # Expand: 3600 - 240d + 4d² + 3600 - 120d + d² = 3600
    # Simplify: 7200 - 360d + 5d² = 3600
    # 5d² - 360d + 3600 = 0
    # d² - 72d + 720 = 0
    discriminant = 72**2 - 4*720
    d1 = (72 + discriminant**0.5)/2
    d2 = (72 - discriminant**0.5)/2
    for d in [d1, d2]:
        a = c - 2*d
        b = c - d
        if a > 0 and a < b < c:
            area = a * b / 2
            print(f"Case c=60: area = {area}")
