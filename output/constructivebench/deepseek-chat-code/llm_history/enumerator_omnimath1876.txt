[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that there exists a complex number z in the first quadrant (Re(z)>0, Im(z)>0) where z^n equals its complex conjugate's n-th power. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal n by checking each n in order and testing for suitable z values.

The key observation is that z^n = (conj(z))^n implies (z/conj(z))^n = 1, meaning z/conj(z) must be an n-th root of unity. We'll parameterize z in polar form and check for solutions.

```python
import cmath
import math

def find_min_n(max_n=20):
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        # Check if there's a solution for this n
        found = False
        # Try various angles in (0, pi/2)
        for k in range(1, n):
            if math.gcd(k, n) != 1:
                continue  # Reduce to simplest form
            # z/conj(z) = e^(2iθ) = e^(2πik/n)
            # So θ = πk/n must be in (0, π/2)
            if 0 < k/n < 0.5:
                # Any r > 0 will work, take r=1 for simplicity
                theta = math.pi * k / n
                z = cmath.rect(1.0, theta)  # e^(iθ)
                z_n = z ** n
                conj_z_n = z.conjugate() ** n
                if abs(z_n - conj_z_n) < 1e-10:  # Account for floating point errors
                    print(f"Found solution for n={n}: z with angle {theta/math.pi}π")
                    found = True
                    break
        if found:
            print(f"Minimal n found: {n}")
            return n
    print(f"No solution found up to n={max_n}")
    return None
