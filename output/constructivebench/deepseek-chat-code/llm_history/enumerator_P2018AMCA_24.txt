This problem involves finding the value c in [0,1] that maximizes the area of the set where either (x < c < y) or (y < c < x) for (x,y) in [0,1]Ã—[1/2,2/3]. We'll approach this by:

1. Calculating the area for different c values in [0,1]
2. Finding the c that gives maximum area
3. The area calculation involves considering different cases based on c's position relative to 1/2 and 2/3

```python
def calculate_area(c):
    """Calculate the area for a given c in [0,1]"""
    y_min, y_max = 1/2, 2/3
    if c <= y_min:
        # Case 1: c <= 1/2
        # Only x < c < y contributes (since y > c always)
        area = c * (y_max - y_min)
    elif y_min < c < y_max:
        # Case 2: 1/2 < c < 2/3
        # Both conditions contribute
        area1 = c * (y_max - c)  # x < c < y
        area2 = (1 - c) * (c - y_min)  # y < c < x
        area = area1 + area2
    else:  # c >= y_max
        # Case 3: c >= 2/3
        # Only y < c < x contributes (since y < c always)
        area = (1 - c) * (y_max - y_min)
    return area

# Evaluate at key points and find maximum
test_points = [0, 1/2, 2/3, 1] + [i/1000 for i in range(500, 667)]  # dense around [1/2,2/3]
max_area = 0
best_c = 0

for c in test_points:
    current_area = calculate_area(c)
    print(f"c = {c:.3f}, area = {current_area:.6f}")
    if current_area > max_area:
        max_area = current_area
        best_c = c

print(f"\nMaximum area occurs at c = {best_c:.6f}")
```
