[write_program]
This problem asks to find all triples of positive integers (a, b, c) where:
1. (a+b)⁴ is divisible by c
2. (b+c)⁴ is divisible by a
3. (c+a)⁴ is divisible by b
4. a+b+c is prime

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such triples up to a reasonable limit (since the problem suggests there might be finitely many solutions). We'll optimize by:
1. Only checking a ≤ b ≤ c to avoid duplicate permutations
2. Stopping when a+b+c exceeds our prime limit
3. Using modular arithmetic to check divisibility efficiently

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]:
        if n % p == 0:
            return n == p
    d = n - 1
    s = 0
    while d % 2 == 0:
        d //= 2
        s += 1
    for a in [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]:
        if a >= n:
            continue
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(s - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False
    return True

max_prime = 100  # We'll check up to this sum
for a in range(1, max_prime):
    for b in range(a, max_prime - a):
        max_c = max_prime - a - b
        if max_c < b:
            continue
        for c in range(b, max_c + 1):
            s = a + b + c
            if not is_prime(s):
                continue
            if (a + b)**4 % c != 0:
                continue
            if (b + c)**4 % a != 0:
                continue
            if (c + a)**4 % b != 0:
                continue
            print(f"Found solution: ({a}, {b}, {c})")
