[write_program]
This problem involves finding integer solutions to a system of equations with divisibility constraints. We need to find values of `total`, `g`, `y`, and `r` that satisfy all given conditions, particularly focusing on the value of `r` (which is the answer we're seeking).

The conditions are:
1. g = 3*(total/9)
2. y = 4*(total/9)
3. r = 2*(total/9)
4. 9 divides total (total is divisible by 9)
5. g + y = 63
6. r is the answer we want to find

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of `total` that are divisible by 9, compute the corresponding `g`, `y`, and `r` values, and check if they satisfy all conditions.

```python
def find_solutions():
    # We'll search for total values up to 200 (since g+y=63 and g+y=7*(total/9))
    max_total = 200
    for total in range(9, max_total + 1, 9):  # Only multiples of 9
        ninth = total // 9
        g = 3 * ninth
        y = 4 * ninth
        r = 2 * ninth
        if g + y == 63:
            print(f"total={total}, g={g}, y={y}, r={r}")
            # Since we're looking for r, and there's only one solution, we can break
            print(f"Found solution: r = {r}")
            return
    
    print("No solution found in the search range")

find_solutions()
