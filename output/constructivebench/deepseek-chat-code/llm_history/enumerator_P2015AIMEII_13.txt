[write_program]
This problem involves finding the smallest integer N such that exactly 100 of the partial sums of sin(k+1) for k=0 to N are negative. We'll write a Python program to compute partial sums of sin(k+1) and count negative sums, searching for the smallest N where this count reaches exactly 100.

The approach:
1. Compute partial sums incrementally
2. Track the count of negative sums
3. Find the smallest N where count reaches exactly 100
4. Verify no smaller N satisfies the condition

```python
import math

def find_min_N():
    count_negative = 0
    partial_sum = 0.0
    N = 0
    results = []
    
    while count_negative < 100:
        N += 1
        partial_sum += math.sin(N)  # sin(k+1) where k = N-1
        if partial_sum < 0:
            count_negative += 1
            results.append((N, count_negative))
            if count_negative == 100:
                # Verify no smaller N satisfies the condition
                # by checking counts up to N-1
                for m in range(1, N):
                    temp_sum = 0.0
                    temp_count = 0
                    for k in range(1, m+1):
                        temp_sum += math.sin(k)
                        if temp_sum < 0:
                            temp_count += 1
                    if temp_count >= 100:
                        break
                else:
                    print(f"Found minimal N: {N}")
                    return N
    return -1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_N()
```
