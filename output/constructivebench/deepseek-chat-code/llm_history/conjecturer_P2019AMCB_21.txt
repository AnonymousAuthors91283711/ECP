    degree p = 2 ∧ 
    ∃ (r s : ℝ), roots p = {r, s} ∧ 
    ({Polynomial.coeff p 2, Polynomial.coeff p 1, Polynomial.coeff p 0} : Set ℝ) = {r, s}} = P2019AMCB_21_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found: p(x) = -1x^2 + -1x + 0
Found: p(x) = 1x^2 + 1x + -2
Found: p(x) = -1x^2 + -1x + 0
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated answers, we observe that all valid polynomials have coefficients that are either roots themselves or satisfy the given conditions. The pattern suggests there are exactly 2 distinct solutions (with duplicates in enumeration). The answer is the count of such unique polynomials.
