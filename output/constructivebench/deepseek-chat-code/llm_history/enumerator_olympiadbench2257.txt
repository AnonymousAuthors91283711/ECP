[write_program]
This problem involves finding a closed-form formula for a function `olympiadbench2257_answer(i,j)` based on given examples. The task is to enumerate possible patterns for small values of i and j to conjecture the formula.

We'll write a Python program that:
1. Computes the formula for small values of i and j
2. Prints the results in a grid format to help identify patterns
3. Compares with the given example (50,40) = 4090 to verify

```python
def compute_formula(i, j):
    return 4 + 3 * (i - 1) + (3 + 4 * (i - 1)) * (j - 1)

# Print header
print("i\\j", end="")
for j in range(1, 6):
    print(f"{j:8}", end="")
print()

# Print values for i from 1 to 5 and j from 1 to 5
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(f"{i}", end="")
    for j in range(1, 6):
        val = compute_formula(i, j)
        print(f"{val:8}", end="")
    print()

# Verify the given example
example_i, example_j = 50, 40
example_val = compute_formula(example_i, example_j)
print(f"\nVerification for (i,j) = (50,40): {example_val}")
```
