This problem asks for the smallest natural number k such that the sum of the first k odd numbers equals 100. The sum of the first k odd numbers is known to be k², so we're looking for the smallest k where k² ≥ 100. The solution is k=10 since 10²=100.

Here's a Python program that enumerates possible k values and checks when the sum reaches or exceeds 100:

```python
def find_min_k(target=100):
    sum_odds = 0
    k = 0
    while True:
        k += 1
        sum_odds += 2 * k - 1  # k-th odd number
        print(f"k={k}, sum={sum_odds}")
        if sum_odds >= target:
            print(f"Smallest k where sum >= {target} is {k}")
            return

find_min_k()
```
