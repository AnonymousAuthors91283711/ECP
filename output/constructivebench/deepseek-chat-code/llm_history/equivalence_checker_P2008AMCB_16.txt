Ground Truth Answer: {(4, 6), (5, 12)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b) | ∃ k : ℕ, (a = k + 2 ∧ b = 2*k + 2) ∨ (a = k + 2 ∧ b = k*(k + 2) + 2)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for pairs (a,b) where b > a > 0 and there exist natural numbers x,y such that:
   - x + 2 = a
   - y + 2 = b
   - x*y = a*b/2
   - 2 divides a*b

2. The ground truth gives two specific solutions: (4,6) and (5,12)

3. The proposed answer gives a general form:
   - Either (a,b) = (k+2, 2k+2)
   - Or (a,b) = (k+2, k(k+2)+2)

Let's test if the ground truth solutions fit the proposed form:

For (4,6):
- k=2 gives (2+2, 2*2+2) = (4,6) - matches first case

For (5,12):
- k=3 gives (3+2, 3*(3+2)+2) = (5,17) ≠ (5,12) - doesn't match
Wait, this seems incorrect. Let me check again:
Actually, for k=3: (3+2, 3*5+2) = (5,17) ≠ (5,12)
But (5,12) doesn't seem to fit either form in the proposed answer.

Therefore, the proposed answer doesn't capture (5,12) correctly.

<<<False>>>
