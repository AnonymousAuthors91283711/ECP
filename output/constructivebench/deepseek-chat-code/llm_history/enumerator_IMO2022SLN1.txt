[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number n that has three distinct divisors a < b < c such that a + b + c = 2022. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal n by:

1. Iterating possible values of n in ascending order
2. For each n, finding all its divisors
3. Checking all triplets of divisors (a,b,c) to see if they satisfy the conditions
4. Stopping at the first n that meets the criteria

The program will efficiently check divisors and stop at the first valid solution.

```python
def find_min_n():
    target = 2022
    n = 1
    while True:
        divisors = []
        # Find all divisors of n up to target
        for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                if i < target:
                    divisors.append(i)
                counterpart = n // i
                if counterpart != i and counterpart < target:
                    divisors.append(counterpart)
        divisors = sorted(divisors)
        # Check all possible triplets
        for i in range(len(divisors)):
            a = divisors[i]
            for j in range(i+1, len(divisors)):
                b = divisors[j]
                remaining = target - a - b
                if remaining <= b:
                    continue  # c must be > b
                if remaining in divisors[j+1:]:
                    print(f"Found solution: n={n} with divisors ({a}, {b}, {remaining})")
                    return n
        n += 1

find_min_n()
```
