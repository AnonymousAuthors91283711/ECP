The problem asks to count numbers n from 1 to 300 where:
1. n is divisible by 3 or 5 (3 ∣ n ∨ 5 ∣ n)
2. n is NOT divisible by 10 or 15 (¬(10 ∣ n ∨ 15 ∣ n))

We'll enumerate numbers 1-300 and count those satisfying both conditions. The solution involves:
1. Checking divisibility by 3 or 5
2. Excluding numbers divisible by 10 or 15
3. Counting the remaining numbers

```python
def is_divisible(n, d):
    return n % d == 0

count = 0
for n in range(1, 301):
    condition1 = is_divisible(n, 3) or is_divisible(n, 5)
    condition2 = not (is_divisible(n, 10) or is_divisible(n, 15))
    if condition1 and condition2:
        count += 1
        print(n)  # Stream partial results

print("Final count:", count)
```
