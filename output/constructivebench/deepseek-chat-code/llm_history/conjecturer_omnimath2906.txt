: 4*x^2 - 3*x^2 = omnimath2906_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: x^2. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 34, which is at "x^2" in "abbrev omnimath2906_answer : ℝ := x^2", there is an error: unknown identifier 'x'.
. Enumerated Answers: For x = 2, 4x² - 3x² = 4. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The error occurs because the proposed answer `x^2` references a variable `x` that isn't in scope in the `abbrev` definition. Since we know from the theorem statement that `x = 2` and the enumerated answer shows the result should be 4, we can compute this directly.

The expression `4*x^2 - 3*x^2` simplifies to `x^2`, and when `x = 2`, this equals 4. Therefore, the correct answer should be the constant value 4.

<<<4>>> 

Explanation: The problem simplifies to x² when x=2, giving 4. Since the answer must be a constant ℝ value (not dependent on x), we use the computed value 4 directly. The error occurred because the abbreviation tried to use x which wasn't in scope - the solution is to use the concrete value instead.
