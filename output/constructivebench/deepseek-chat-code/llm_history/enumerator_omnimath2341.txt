This problem asks for the maximum number of white squares (k) that can be placed on an 8x8 chessboard such that:
1. There are 6 black squares with distinct rows and columns (like non-attacking rooks)
2. Every white square shares a row or column with every black square
3. All white squares have distinct rows and columns

We'll model this by:
1. Generating all possible placements of 6 black squares with distinct rows/columns
2. For each placement, find the maximum number of white squares that can satisfy the conditions
3. Track the maximum k found across all placements

```python
from itertools import combinations

def solve():
    n = 8
    black_size = 6
    max_k = 0
    
    # Generate all possible black placements (6 squares with distinct rows/cols)
    rows = list(range(n))
    cols = list(range(n))
    for black_rows in combinations(rows, black_size):
        for black_cols in combinations(cols, black_size):
            black = list(zip(black_rows, black_cols))
            
            # Find all positions that share row or column with every black square
            white_candidates = []
            for r in range(n):
                for c in range(n):
                    if (r, c) in black:
                        continue
                    valid = True
                    for (br, bc) in black:
                        if r != br and c != bc:
                            valid = False
                            break
                    if valid:
                        white_candidates.append((r, c))
            
            # Find maximum subset of white candidates with distinct rows/cols
            max_white = 0
            rows_used = set()
            cols_used = set()
            white_candidates.sort()  # for deterministic selection
            for (r, c) in white_candidates:
                if r not in rows_used and c not in cols_used:
                    rows_used.add(r)
                    cols_used.add(c)
                    max_white += 1
            
            if max_white > max_k:
                max_k = max_white
                print(f"New max k={max_k} found with black squares {black}")
    
    print(f"Final maximum k: {max_k}")

solve()
```
