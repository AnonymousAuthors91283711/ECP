This problem asks for the number of positive integers k < 100 that are relatively prime to 200. Since 200 factors into 2^3 * 5^2, we need to count numbers < 100 not divisible by 2 or 5.

We'll:
1. Compute Euler's totient φ(200) = 200*(1-1/2)*(1-1/5) = 80
2. Since 100 is exactly half of 200, the count should be φ(200)/2 = 40
3. Verify by enumeration

Here's the Python program to enumerate and count numbers <100 relatively prime to 200:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

count = 0
for k in range(1, 100):
    if gcd(k, 200) == 1:
        count += 1
        print(f"Found relatively prime number: {k}")  # Stream partial results

print(f"Total count: {count}")  # Final answer
```
