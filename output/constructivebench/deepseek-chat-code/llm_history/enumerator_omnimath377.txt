This problem involves calculating the probability that the sum of two dice rolls (each from 1 to 6) is divisible by 5. We'll enumerate all possible dice combinations (6Ã—6=36 total) and count how many satisfy (d1 + d2) mod 5 = 0.

```python
def enumerate_dice_probability():
    count = 0
    total = 36
    for d1 in range(1, 7):
        for d2 in range(1, 7):
            if (d1 + d2) % 5 == 0:
                count += 1
                print(f"Found pair: ({d1}, {d2})")
    probability = f"{count}/{total}"
    print(f"Probability: {probability}")

enumerate_dice_probability()
```
