[write_program]
This problem involves finding the floor of the sum of all fractions a/b where (a,b) are coprime pairs of divisors of 1000, divided by 10. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such pairs, compute the sum, and find the required floor value.

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def solve():
    # Get all positive divisors of 1000
    n = 1000
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(n // i)
    divisors = sorted(divisors)
    
    # Generate all coprime pairs (a,b) where a,b are divisors
    total = Fraction(0, 1)
    for a in divisors:
        for b in divisors:
            if math.gcd(a, b) == 1:
                total += Fraction(a, b)
    
    # Compute floor(total / 10)
    result = total / 10
    print(f"Sum of fractions: {total}")
    print(f"Sum divided by 10: {result}")
    print(f"Final answer (floor): {int(result)}")

    solve()
