[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of positive integer solutions (a,b,c,d) to the equation 12a + 21b + 28c + 84d = 2024. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible solutions by iterating through possible values of d, c, b, and then solving for a.

The approach:
1. Since 84d must be ≤ 2024, d can be at most 24 (2024//84)
2. For each d, compute remaining value after subtracting 84d
3. Similarly bound c based on 28c ≤ remaining
4. Then bound b based on 21b ≤ new remaining
5. Finally check if remaining is divisible by 12 for positive a

```python
def count_solutions():
    target = 2024
    count = 0
    max_d = target // 84
    for d in range(1, max_d + 1):
        remaining = target - 84 * d
        if remaining <= 0:
            continue
        max_c = remaining // 28
        for c in range(1, max_c + 1):
            remaining2 = remaining - 28 * c
            if remaining2 <= 0:
                continue
            max_b = remaining2 // 21
            for b in range(1, max_b + 1):
                remaining3 = remaining2 - 21 * b
                if remaining3 <= 0:
                    continue
                if remaining3 % 12 == 0:
                    a = remaining3 // 12
                    if a > 0:
                        count += 1
                        # Print each solution found
                        print(f"Solution {count}: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}")
    print(f"Total number of solutions: {count}")

count_solutions()
```
