Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 2 * n^2 - 2 * n + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n = 0 then 1 else 2 * n^2 - 2 * n + 1
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but differs from the ground truth answer in the case when n = 0. The ground truth answer is defined for all natural numbers n, while the proposed answer has a special case for n = 0. However, for all n ≥ 1, the two answers are equivalent. The problem statement specifies n ≥ 3 in the theorem, so within that domain they are equivalent, but the proposed answer extends the definition to handle n = 0 differently.
