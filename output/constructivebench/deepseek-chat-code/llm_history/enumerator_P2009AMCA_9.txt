This problem involves finding the sum of coefficients (a+b+c) of a quadratic function f(x) = ax² + bx + c, given a functional equation f(x+3) = 3x² + 7x + 4. We'll solve for a, b, c by expanding f(x+3) and matching coefficients.

The approach is:
1. Expand f(x+3) = a(x+3)² + b(x+3) + c
2. Set this equal to 3x² + 7x + 4
3. Solve the resulting system of equations for a, b, c
4. Compute a + b + c

Here's the Python program to compute this:

```python
# Expand f(x+3) = a(x+3)^2 + b(x+3) + c = ax^2 + (6a+b)x + (9a+3b+c)
# Set equal to 3x^2 + 7x + 4 and match coefficients:
# a = 3
# 6a + b = 7 => b = 7 - 6*3 = -11
# 9a + 3b + c = 4 => c = 4 - 9*3 - 3*(-11) = 4 - 27 + 33 = 10
# Sum a + b + c = 3 - 11 + 10 = 2

# The program simply computes and outputs the solution:
a = 3
b = -11
c = 10
print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}, c = {c}")
print(f"a + b + c = {a + b + c}")
```
