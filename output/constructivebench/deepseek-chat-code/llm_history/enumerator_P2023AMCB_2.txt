This problem asks for the greatest real number p such that:
1. p > 0
2. (p * 0.8) * 1.075 â‰¤ 43

We can solve this algebraically by finding the maximum p that satisfies the inequality. The program will verify the solution by checking values around the theoretical maximum.

```python
def main():
    # The inequality simplifies to p â‰¤ 43 / (0.8 * 1.075)
    # We'll check values around this point to verify
    exact_p = 43 / (0.8 * 1.075)
    print(f"Exact solution: {exact_p}")
    
    # Check nearby values to confirm it's the maximum
    epsilon = 1e-6
    test_values = [exact_p - epsilon, exact_p, exact_p + epsilon]
    
    for p in test_values:
        satisfies = (p > 0) and ((p * 0.8) * 1.075 <= 43)
        print(f"p = {p:.8f}, satisfies conditions: {satisfies}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
