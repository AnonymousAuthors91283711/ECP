theorem olympiadbench2832 (T : ℕ) (hT : 0 < T) :
  let minNum := 10^(T - 1)
  let N := if minNum % 33 = 0 then minNum else minNum + (33 - minNum % 33)
  (N % 10) * ((N / 10) % 10) = olympiadbench2832_answer T := by sorry. Enumerated answers: T=2: Product of last two digits = 9
T=3: Product of last two digits = 6
T=4: Product of last two digits = 6
T=5: Product of last two digits = 6
T=6: Product of last two digits = 6
T=7: Product of last two digits = 6
T=8: Product of last two digits = 6
T=9: Product of last two digits = 6
T=10: Product of last two digits = 6. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
