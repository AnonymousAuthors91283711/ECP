abbrev omnimath2948_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2948
(x : ℕ)
(hx : 2 * x + 6 = 16)
: x + 4 = omnimath2948_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 9
Proposed Answer: 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us the equation: 2 * x + 6 = 16
2. Solving for x:
   - Subtract 6 from both sides: 2 * x = 10
   - Divide both sides by 2: x = 5
3. The question asks for x + 4:
   - x + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9

The ground truth answer is 9, which is correct.
The proposed answer is 5, which is just the value of x, not x + 4.
