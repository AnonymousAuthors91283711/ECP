This problem asks for the number of functions f from {1,2,...,9} to â„• such that:
1. f(f(f(x))) = x for all x in {1,...,9}
2. f(x) - x is not divisible by 3 for all x in {1,...,9}

We'll enumerate all possible functions on {1,...,9} that satisfy these conditions. Since f^3 = id, f must be a permutation composed of 1-cycles and 3-cycles. We'll generate all such permutations and count those satisfying the second condition.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def solve():
    S = set(range(1, 10))
    total = 0
    
    # Generate all possible 3-cycles
    def generate_3_cycles(elements):
        if not elements:
            yield []
            return
        first = elements[0]
        for second in elements[1:]:
            remaining = [x for x in elements if x != first and x != second]
            for third in elements[1:]:
                if third != second:
                    for rest in generate_3_cycles(remaining):
                        yield [(first, second, third)] + rest
    
    # Check all possible combinations of fixed points and 3-cycles
    for k in range(0, 10, 3):  # Number of elements in 3-cycles (must be multiple of 3)
        fixed = set(range(1, 10))
        if k > 0:
            for cycle_set in permutations(range(1, 10), k):

                    # Handle fixed points
                    fixed_points = [x for x in range(1, 10) if x not in f]
                    for x in fixed_points:
