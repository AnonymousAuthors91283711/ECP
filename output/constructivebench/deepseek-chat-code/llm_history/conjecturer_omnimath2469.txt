noncomputable abbrev omnimath2469_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2469
: IsGreatest {2^(x*(1-x)) | x ∈ Set.Icc 0 1} (omnimath2469_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x = 0.0: f(x) = 1.0
x = 0.5: f(x) = 1.189207115002721
x = 1.0: f(x) = 1.0
x = 0.25: f(x) = 1.1387886347566916
x = 0.75: f(x) = 1.1387886347566916

Maximum value occurs at x=0.5 with value 1.189207115002721. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<Real.sqrt 2>>>
