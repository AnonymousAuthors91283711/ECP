This problem involves finding the ratio c/a given certain geometric constraints. We'll approach it by:
1. Expressing variables in terms of a common parameter
2. Using the given equations to find relationships
3. Enumerating possible ratios to identify patterns

The key constraints are:
- a, b, c > 0
- a*c = b² (geometric mean condition)
- a² + b² = c² (right triangle condition)

We'll solve for c/a by parameterizing variables and checking possible ratios.

```python
import math

def find_ratio():
    # We'll parameterize a=1 and find corresponding c
    # Since a*c = b^2 and a^2 + b^2 = c^2
    # Substitute b^2 = a*c into second equation:
    # a^2 + a*c = c^2
    # Divide by a^2: 1 + (c/a) = (c/a)^2
    # Let r = c/a, then r^2 - r - 1 = 0
    # Solve quadratic equation:
    discriminant = 1 + 4
    r1 = (1 + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
    r2 = (1 - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
    
    # Only positive solution is valid since a,c > 0
    print(f"Possible ratio c/a: {r1}")
    
    # Verification with exact value (golden ratio)
    phi = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2
    print(f"Golden ratio: {phi}")
    
    # Check if they match
    print(f"Difference: {abs(r1 - phi)}")

find_ratio()
