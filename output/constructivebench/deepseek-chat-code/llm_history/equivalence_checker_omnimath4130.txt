Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 2, 2), (2, 2, 3), (2, 6, 11), (3, 5, 7)}
Proposed Answer: {(2, 2, 2), (2, 2, 3), (2, 3, 2), (2, 6, 11), (2, 11, 6), (3, 2, 2), (3, 5, 7), (3, 7, 5), (5, 3, 7), (5, 7, 3), (6, 2, 11), (6, 11, 2), (7, 3, 5), (7, 5, 3), (11, 2, 6), (11, 6, 2)}

The proposed answer includes all permutations of the tuples in the ground truth answer, which are valid solutions since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c. However, the ground truth answer only lists one permutation of each unique solution (likely for conciseness). The proposed answer is correct but more exhaustive. They are equivalent in terms of the solution space covered, though not identical in presentation.
