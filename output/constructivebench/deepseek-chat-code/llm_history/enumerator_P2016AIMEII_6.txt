[write_program]
This problem involves computing the sum of absolute values of coefficients of a polynomial product. We'll write a Python program to compute this sum by constructing the polynomial Q and summing the absolute values of its coefficients up to degree 50.

The polynomial Q is defined as P(x) * P(x³) * P(x⁵) * P(x⁷) * P(x⁹), where P(x) = 1 - (1/3)x + (1/6)x². We'll represent polynomials as dictionaries mapping exponents to coefficients.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def multiply_poly(p1, p2):
    """Multiply two polynomials represented as dictionaries"""
    result = {}
    for exp1, coeff1 in p1.items():
        for exp2, coeff2 in p2.items():
            exp = exp1 + exp2
            result[exp] = result.get(exp, Fraction(0)) + coeff1 * coeff2
    return result

def compose_poly(p, power):
    """Compute p(x^power) for a polynomial p"""
    return {exp * power: coeff for exp, coeff in p.items()}

def main():
    # Define P(x) = 1 - (1/3)x + (1/6)x^2
    P = {0: Fraction(1), 1: Fraction(-1, 3), 2: Fraction(1, 6)}
    
    # Compute Q = P(x) * P(x^3) * P(x^5) * P(x^7) * P(x^9)
    Q = P.copy()
    for power in [3, 5, 7, 9]:
        Q = multiply_poly(Q, compose_poly(P, power))
    
    # Sum absolute values of coefficients for degrees 0 to 50
    total = sum(abs(Q.get(i, 0)) for i in range(51))
    
    # Print exact fraction and decimal approximation
    print(f"Sum of absolute coefficients: {total} (≈{float(total):.4f})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
