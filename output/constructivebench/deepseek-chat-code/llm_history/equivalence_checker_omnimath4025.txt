Ground Truth Answer: {⟨2 ^ k, 2 ^ k⟩ | k ≥ 0} ∪ {⟨2 * 3 ^ k, 3 ^ k⟩ | k ≥ 0} ∪ {⟨3 ^ k, 2 * 3 ^ k⟩ | k ≥ 0}
Proposed Answer: {xy : ℕ × ℕ | let (x, y) := xy; x = y ∨ (x = 1 ∧ y = 2) ∨ (x = 2 ∧ y = 1) ∨ (x = 3 ∧ y = 6) ∨ (x = 6 ∧ y = 3) ∨ (x = 9 ∧ y = 18) ∨ (x = 18 ∧ y = 9)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all pairs (x,y) of positive integers where for any two coprime divisors a,b of x³ + y³, we have a + b - 1 divides x³ + y³.

2. The ground truth answer gives three infinite families:
   - (2^k, 2^k)
   - (2*3^k, 3^k)
   - (3^k, 2*3^k)

3. The proposed answer gives:
   - All pairs where x = y
   - Plus some specific small cases (1,2), (2,1), (3,6), etc.

Comparison:
- The proposed answer correctly includes all pairs where x = y (which matches the first family in ground truth when x=y=2^k)
- However, it misses the infinite families (2*3^k, 3^k) and (3^k, 2*3^k), only listing a few small cases from these families
- It incorrectly includes (1,2) and (2,1) which don't satisfy the condition (1³+2³=9, but for a=1,b=9: 1+9-1=9 which divides 9, but for a=3,b=3: 3+3-1=5 doesn't divide 9)
