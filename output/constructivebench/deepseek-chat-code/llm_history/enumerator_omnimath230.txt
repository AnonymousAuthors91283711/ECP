[write_program]
This problem appears to be about finding the possible cardinalities of finite sets of natural numbers where each element has a unique "complement" for every divisor. The mathematical formulation suggests we need to find all possible sizes of such sets.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate small candidate sets and check the given condition, looking for possible cardinalities that satisfy the property. The program will:
1. Generate small sets of positive integers
2. Check the condition that for every element and every divisor, there's exactly one other element with that GCD
3. Track the cardinalities that satisfy this condition

```python
import math
from itertools import combinations

def satisfies_condition(S):
    S = sorted(S)
    n = len(S)
    for s in S:
        if s <= 0:
            return False
        divisors = set()
        for d in range(1, s+1):
            if s % d == 0:
                divisors.add(d)
        for d in divisors:
            if d == 0:
                continue
            count = 0
            for t in S:
                if math.gcd(s, t) == d:
                    count += 1
            if count != 1:
                return False
    return True

max_size = 6  # Reasonable upper bound for enumeration
found_cardinalities = set()

print("Checking sets up to size", max_size)
print("Valid cardinalities found:")

for size in range(1, max_size + 1):
    # Check all combinations of 'size' distinct numbers from 1 to 2*size
    # (a reasonable range to find small examples)
    for nums in combinations(range(1, 2*size + 1), size):
        if satisfies_condition(nums):
            found_cardinalities.add(size)
            print(size, end=' ', flush=True)
            break  # Only need one example per cardinality

print("\nPossible cardinalities:", sorted(found_cardinalities))
```
