[write_program]
This problem involves finding the value of a polynomial Q evaluated at x=-1/2, given certain conditions about polynomials P and Q. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values for small n and look for patterns.

The key observations:
1. We need to find P and Q of degree â‰¤n satisfying the given equation
2. The equation must hold for all x, so coefficients must match
3. We'll use symbolic computation to find Q(-1/2) for small n

```python
from sympy import symbols, Poly, binomial, expand, solve

def compute_q_minus_half(n_max=5):
    x = symbols('x')
    for n in range(n_max + 1):
        print(f"\nn = {n}")
        
        # Create general polynomials P and Q of degree <=n
        p_coeffs = symbols([f'a{i}' for i in range(n+1)])
        q_coeffs = symbols([f'b{i}' for i in range(n+1)])
        
        P = Poly(sum(p_coeffs[i]*x**i for i in range(n+1)), x)
        Q = Poly(sum(q_coeffs[i]*x**i for i in range(n+1)), x)
        
        # Construct the equation P*x^(n+1) + Q*(x+1)^(n+1) = 1
        lhs = P * x**(n+1) + Q * (x + 1)**(n+1)
        expanded_lhs = expand(lhs)
        
        # Get coefficients of the expanded polynomial
        coeff_eqs = []
        for k in range(2*n + 2):
            if k == 0:
                # Constant term must be 1
                coeff_eqs.append(expanded_lhs.coeff(x, k) - 1)
            else:
                # Other coefficients must be 0
                coeff_eqs.append(expanded_lhs.coeff(x, k))
        
        # Solve the system of equations
        solution = solve(coeff_eqs, p_coeffs + q_coeffs)
        
        if not solution:
            print("No solution found")
            continue
            
        # Evaluate Q(-1/2) using the solution
        Q_solved = Q.subs(solution)
        q_value = Q_solved.subs(x, -1/2)
        
        # Simplify and print exact form if possible
        from sympy import simplify, fraction, Rational
        simplified = simplify(q_value)
        num, den = fraction(simplified)
        if den != 1:
            simplified = Rational(num, den)
        print(f"Q(-1/2) = {simplified}")
