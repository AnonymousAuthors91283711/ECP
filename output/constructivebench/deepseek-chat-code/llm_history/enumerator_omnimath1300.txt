[write_program]
The problem asks to find the sum of all positive even numbers less than 233 that are not divisible by 10. We'll write a Python program to enumerate and sum these numbers.

Key points:
1. Range: 1 to 232 (since 233 is excluded)
2. Conditions: even (n%2 == 0) and not divisible by 10 (n%10 != 0)
3. We'll iterate through the range and sum qualifying numbers

```python
def solve():
    total = 0
    for n in range(1, 233):
        if n % 2 == 0 and n % 10 != 0:
            total += n
    print(total)

solve()
```
