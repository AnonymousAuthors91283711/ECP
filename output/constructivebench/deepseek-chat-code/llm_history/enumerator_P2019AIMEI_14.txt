[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest odd prime divisor of \(2019^8 + 1\). We'll write a Python program to find all odd prime divisors of this number up to a reasonable threshold and identify the smallest one.

The approach:
1. Compute \(2019^8 + 1\) (though we'll find divisors without full computation)
2. Check divisibility by odd primes in increasing order
3. Stop when we find the first (smallest) divisor

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n in (2, 3):
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    d = 3
    while d * d <= n:
        if n % d == 0:
            return False
        d += 2
    return True

def find_min_odd_prime_divisor():
    n = 2019
    target = n**8 + 1
    # Check odd primes in increasing order
    p = 3
    while p <= 10**6:  # Reasonable upper bound
        if is_prime(p) and pow(n, 8, p) == p - 1:  # Equivalent to p divides n^8 + 1
            print(f"Found divisor: {p}")
            return p  # Return first (smallest) found
        p += 2
    print("No divisor found within search limit")
    return None

find_min_odd_prime_divisor()
```
