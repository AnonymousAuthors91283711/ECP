[write_program]
This problem involves determining when three vectors in ℝ³ are collinear, which occurs when the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors is zero. The condition is given by a specific equation involving a and b. We'll write a program to find pairs (a,b) that satisfy this condition.

The collinearity condition can be expressed as the determinant of the matrix:
| 1  a  b |
| a  2  b |
| a  b  3 |
being equal to zero. We'll compute this determinant symbolically and solve for relationships between a and b.

```python
import sympy as sp

def find_collinear_pairs():
    a, b = sp.symbols('a b')
    # Construct the matrix
    M = sp.Matrix([
        [1, a, b],
        [a, 2, b],
        [a, b, 3]
    ])
    # Compute determinant
    det = M.det()
    # Simplify the determinant equation det = 0
    equation = sp.simplify(det)
    print(f"Determinant equation: {equation}")
    
    # Find solutions for small integer values of a
    for a_val in range(-5, 6):
        if a_val == 0:
            continue  # Skip a=0 as it leads to trivial cases
        # Substitute a value and solve for b
        eq = equation.subs(a, a_val)
        solutions = sp.solve(eq, b)
        for b_val in solutions:
            # Check if solution is real
            if b_val.is_real:
                print(f"Found pair: a={a_val}, b={b_val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_collinear_pairs()
```

The program:
1. Uses sympy for symbolic computation
2. Constructs the matrix and computes its determinant
3. Solves the determinant equation for small integer values of a
4. Prints real solutions for b corresponding to each a
5. Outputs both the general determinant equation and specific solution pairs

The output will show the general condition for collinearity and specific examples where this occurs, helping to identify patterns in the solutions. The exact form of omnimath647_answer can be deduced from the determinant equation.
