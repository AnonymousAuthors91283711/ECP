open Matrix

abbrev omnimath313_answer : Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath313 : 
  ¬(∃ (A : Matrix (Fin 3) (Fin 3) ℝ), 
    trace A = 0 ∧ A ^ 2 + Aᵀ = 1) ↔ omnimath313_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: After 10000 trials, no matrix satisfying the condition was found.
This suggests the theorem might be true (no such matrix exists).
. Expected Answer Type: Prop
<<<True>>>
