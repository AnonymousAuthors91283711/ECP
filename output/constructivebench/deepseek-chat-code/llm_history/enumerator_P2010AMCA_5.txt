This problem involves finding the minimal number n such that Chelsea's total score exceeds the opponent's total score under given constraints. Chelsea has 50 initial points plus remaining points from 50 matches (each being 4, 8, or 10) plus 10n bonus points. The opponent has remaining points from 100 matches (each being 0, 2, 4, 8, or 10). We need to find the smallest n where Chelsea always wins regardless of how the points are distributed.

We'll enumerate possible n values and check the worst-case scenario where Chelsea has minimal remaining points (all 4s) and opponent has maximal remaining points (all 10s).

```python
def main():
    # Chelsea's minimal possible remaining points (all 4s)
    chelsea_min_remaining = 50 * 4
    # Opponent's maximal possible remaining points (all 10s)
    opponent_max_remaining = 100 * 10
    
    # Find minimal n where Chelsea's total > opponent's total in worst case
    for n in range(0, 100):
        chelsea_total = 50 + chelsea_min_remaining + 10 * n
        opponent_total = opponent_max_remaining  # Since opponent can choose any distribution
        
        if chelsea_total > opponent_total:
            print(f"Found candidate n = {n}")
            print(f"Minimal required n is {n}")
            return
    
    print("No solution found in range")

    main()
```
