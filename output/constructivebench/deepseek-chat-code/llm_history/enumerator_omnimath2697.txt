This problem is asking to find the unique rational number `w` that satisfies the equation `3/5 * w = 1/3`. We can solve this algebraically by isolating `w`:

1. Start with the equation: (3/5)*w = 1/3
2. Multiply both sides by 5/3: w = (1/3)*(5/3) = 5/9

The solution is w = 5/9. Here's a Python program that verifies this solution by checking the equation:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve():
    w = Fraction(5, 9)
    left_side = Fraction(3, 5) * w
    right_side = Fraction(1, 3)
    print(f"Solution w = {w}")
    print(f"Verification: 3/5 * {w} = {left_side}")
    print(f"Which equals 1/3: {left_side == right_side}")

solve()
```
