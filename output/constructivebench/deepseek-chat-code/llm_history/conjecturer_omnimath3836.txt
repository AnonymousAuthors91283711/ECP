Note: Minimum sum appears to be n*(n^2+1)/2 = 65. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the enumerated answers and the pattern observed, the minimum sum appears to follow the formula n*(n+1)/2 for an n×n grid. For n=8, this gives 8*9/2 = 36. The pattern matches the minimum sums observed in smaller grids (1→1, 2→3, 3→6, 4→10, etc.), though the problem statement shows some discrepancies (like 2x2 showing 6 instead of 3). However, the most consistent pattern is the triangular numbers.
