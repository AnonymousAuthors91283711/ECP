This problem involves finding 2x2 matrices of positive integers where the sum of row products plus column products equals 2015, and we need to find the minimal possible sum of all matrix elements. We'll enumerate possible 2x2 matrices with small values to find patterns and candidates for the minimal sum.

```python
def main():
    target = 2015
    min_total = float('inf')
    
    # We'll iterate through possible a,b,c,d values (matrix elements)
    # Since we're looking for minimal sum, start with small values
    max_val = 100  # Reasonable upper bound for initial search
    
    for a in range(1, max_val + 1):
        for b in range(1, max_val + 1):
            for c in range(1, max_val + 1):
                for d in range(1, max_val + 1):
                    # Calculate the condition: a*b + c*d + a*c + b*d = 2015
                    total = a*b + c*d + a*c + b*d
                    if total == target:
                        current_sum = a + b + c + d
                        if current_sum < min_total:
                            min_total = current_sum
                            print(f"Found matrix: [[{a}, {b}], [{c}, {d}]] with sum {current_sum}")
    
    if min_total != float('inf'):
        print(f"\nMinimal sum found: {min_total}")
    else:
        print("No solution found within the search range")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
