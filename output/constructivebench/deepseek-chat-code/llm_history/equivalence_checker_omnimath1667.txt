Proposed Answer: {f : Fin 9 → ℕ | ∃ (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin 9)), 
    (∀ i, f i = (σ i).val + 1) ∧ 
    f 0 + f 1 + f 2 + f 3 = f 3 + f 4 + f 5 + f 6 ∧
    f 0 + f 1 + f 2 + f 3 = f 6 + f 7 + f 8 + f 0 ∧
    f 0^2 + f 1^2 + f 2^2 + f 3^2 = f 3^2 + f 4^2 + f 5^2 + f 6^2 ∧
    f 0^2 + f 1^2 + f 2^2 + f 3^2 = f 6^2 + f 7^2 + f 8^2 + f 0^2}
<<<True>>>

The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Here's why:

1. Both define the set of functions f: Fin 9 → ℕ that satisfy certain conditions
2. Both require the existence of a permutation σ of Fin 9
3. The proposed answer uses f i directly while the ground truth uses nums i, but they're equivalent since f i = (σ i).val + 1 = nums i
4. All the equality conditions (both linear and quadratic) are identical, just expressed using different variable names
5. The proposed answer doesn't explicitly state the distinctness condition, but it's implied by the permutation σ (which guarantees all outputs are distinct and cover 1-9)
6. The permutation σ ensures the range is exactly 1-9, matching the ground truth's condition about the image being (range 9).image (· + 1)

The answers are semantically identical, just expressed with slightly different syntax.
