[write_program]
The problem asks to compute the sum of floor divisions of 300 by 20 and 30. We'll write a Python program that calculates this exact value. Since there are no parameters or enumeration needed, we'll directly compute and output the result.

```python
t = 300
result = (t // 20) + (t // 30)
print(result)
```
