Ground Truth Answer: 2004002
Proposed Answer: 1001
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves evaluating a finite sum of alternating terms with quadratic coefficients.

2. The ground truth answer is 2004002.

3. The proposed answer is 1001.

4. Let's consider the sum structure:
   - It's an alternating series with terms (-1)^(k+1) * (k+1)(k+2)
   - The sum runs from k=0 to k=2000 (since Finset.range 2001 gives {0,1,...,2000})
   - The quadratic term (k+1)(k+2) suggests the sum should be on the order of n² where n=2000

5. The proposed answer (1001) is much smaller than the ground truth (2004002) and doesn't match the expected scale of the sum.

6. The correct answer should be close to (2000)²/2 = 2,000,000 (since the alternating quadratic terms would roughly average out to half the maximum term), which aligns with the ground truth answer of 2004002.
