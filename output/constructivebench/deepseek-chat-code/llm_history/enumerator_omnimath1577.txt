[write_program]
This problem asks to count numbers n from 1 to 2009 where the floor of log base 2 of n is odd. We'll write a Python program to enumerate these numbers and count them.

The approach:
1. For each n from 1 to 2009, compute floor(log2(n))
2. Check if the result is odd
3. Count all such numbers

We'll use Python's math module for log calculations and floor function.

```python
import math

count = 0
for n in range(1, 2010):
    log_floor = math.floor(math.log2(n))
    if log_floor % 2 == 1:
        count += 1
        print(n)  # Print each qualifying number

print("Total count:", count)
```
