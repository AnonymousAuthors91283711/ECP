[write_program]
The problem asks to find the smallest natural number n > 101 such that the rightmost non-zero digit of 101! equals the rightmost non-zero digit of n!. We'll write a Python program to enumerate factorials and compare their rightmost non-zero digits with 101!'s.

Key observations:
1. Compute the rightmost non-zero digit by removing all factors of 10 (divisible by both 2 and 5) then taking modulo 10
2. We need to compute this for 101! first, then compare with n! for n > 101
3. The solution must be efficient since factorials grow rapidly

```python
def rightmost_nonzero(n):
    # Compute rightmost non-zero digit of n!
    count2 = 0
    count5 = 0
    res = 1
    
    # First pass: count factors of 2 and 5, compute product modulo 10
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        j = i
        while j % 2 == 0:
            j //= 2
            count2 += 1
        while j % 5 == 0:
            j //= 5
            count5 += 1
        res = (res * j) % 10
    
    # Remove pairs of 2 and 5 (each pair makes a 10)
    excess = count2 - count5
    if excess > 0:
        res = (res * pow(2, excess, 10)) % 10
    return res

# Compute target (101!)
target = rightmost_nonzero(101)
print(f"Rightmost non-zero digit of 101! is {target}")

# Search for smallest n > 101 with same rightmost digit
n = 102
while True:
    current = rightmost_nonzero(n)
    print(f"Testing n = {n}, digit = {current}")
    if current == target:
        print(f"Found solution: n = {n}")
        break
    n += 1
```
