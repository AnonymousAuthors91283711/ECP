This problem involves finding the swim speed that makes the total time (swim + bike + run) equal to 4.25 hours, then calculating the bike time in minutes. We'll solve the equation numerically and output possible swim speeds and corresponding bike times.

```python
def solve():
    # We'll search swim speeds from 0.01 to 10 in small increments
    min_swim = 0.01
    max_swim = 10.0
    step = 0.0001
    target_total = 4.25
    
    best_swim = None
    best_diff = float('inf')
    
    swim = min_swim
    while swim <= max_swim:
        run_speed = 5 * swim
        bike_speed = 2 * run_speed
        
        swim_time = 0.5 / swim
        bike_time = 30 / bike_speed
        run_time = 8 / run_speed
        
        total_time = swim_time + bike_time + run_time
        current_diff = abs(total_time - target_total)
        
        if current_diff < best_diff:
            best_diff = current_diff
            best_swim = swim
            bike_time_minutes = bike_time * 60
            # Print candidate solution when found
            print(f"Swim speed: {swim:.5f} mph, Bike time: {bike_time_minutes:.5f} minutes")
            
            # Early exit if we find exact solution (within floating point precision)
            if current_diff < 1e-10:
                break
        
        swim += step
    
    # Output the best found solution
    bike_time_minutes = (30 / (2 * 5 * best_swim)) * 60
    print(f"\nFinal answer (bike time in minutes): {bike_time_minutes:.5f}")

solve()
