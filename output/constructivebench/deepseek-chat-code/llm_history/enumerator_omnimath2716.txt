This problem involves finding integer values `c` and `omnimath2716_answer c` such that both 18 and `omnimath2716_answer c` are roots of the polynomial `X^2 + 12*X + C c`. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible integer values of `c` and the corresponding second root.

Key observations:
1. If 18 is a root, then substituting gives: 18² + 12*18 + c = 0 ⇒ c = -18² - 12*18
2. The sum of roots is -12 (from Vieta's formula), so if one root is 18, the other must be -12 - 18 = -30
3. Therefore, for c = -540, the roots are 18 and -30

The program will:
1. Calculate c from the first root (18)
2. Calculate the second root using Vieta's formula
3. Verify the solution

```python
def main():
    # Given root
    root1 = 18
    
    # Calculate c from the first root
    c = -(root1**2 + 12 * root1)
    print(f"c = {c}")
    
    # Calculate second root using Vieta's formula (sum of roots = -12)
    root2 = -12 - root1
    print(f"Second root = {root2}")
    
    # Verification
    assert root2**2 + 12*root2 + c == 0
    print("Verification passed")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
