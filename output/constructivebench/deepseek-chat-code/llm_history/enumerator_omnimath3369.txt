The problem asks for the count of natural numbers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) that can be expressed as gcd(a², b³) where a and b are positive integers. 

To solve this, we'll:
1. Iterate through all n from 1 to 100
2. For each n, check if there exists positive integers a and b such that n = gcd(a², b³)
3. The condition is equivalent to n being a number whose prime factorization exponents satisfy certain constraints

The key insight is that n must be of the form where for each prime p in its factorization:
- The exponent of p must be ≤ 2 (from a²)
- The exponent must be divisible by 3 or ≤ 2 (from b³)

This means for each prime p in n's factorization:
- The exponent can be 0,1,2 (always allowed)
- Or any multiple of 3 (≥3)

```python
def is_valid(n):
    if n == 1:
        return True
    # Factorize n
    factors = {}
    temp = n
    for p in range(2, int(temp**0.5) + 1):
        while temp % p == 0:
            factors[p] = factors.get(p, 0) + 1
            temp //= p
    if temp > 1:
        factors[temp] = 1
    
    # Check each prime's exponent
    for p, exp in factors.items():
        if exp <= 2:
            continue
        if exp % 3 != 0:
            return False
    return True

count = 0
for n in range(1, 101):
    if is_valid(n):
        count += 1
        print(n)  # Stream partial results
print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
