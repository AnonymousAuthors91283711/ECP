This problem involves counting the number of distinct integer coordinate points reachable within 14 steps of a transformation T applied to the initial set {(0,0)}. The transformation T expands a set by adding all adjacent points (up, down, left, right) to any point in the set.

We'll simulate this process in Python by:
1. Starting with the initial set {(0,0)}
2. Applying the transformation T 14 times (each time adding adjacent points)
3. Counting the number of distinct points after each step

```python
def main():
    # Initialize with the origin point
    current = {(0, 0)}
    visited = set(current)
    
    for step in range(1, 15):
        # Generate all adjacent points
        new_points = set()
        for (x, y) in current:
            for dx, dy in [(0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0)]:
                new_point = (x + dx, y + dy)
                if new_point not in visited:
                    new_points.add(new_point)
        
        # Update current and visited sets
        current = new_points
        visited.update(current)
        
        # Print the count after each step
        print(f"After step {step}: {len(visited)} points")
    
    # Final answer after 14 steps
    print(f"Final count after 14 steps: {len(visited)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
