theorem omnimath2723
    (a b c d : ℕ)
    (h1 : a + b + c + d = 120)
    (h2 : b = a + 6 ∧ c = b + 6 ∧ d = c + 6) :
    d = omnimath2723_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: a = 21, b = 27, c = 33, d = 39
Verification: sum = 120 (should be 120)
Final answer: d = 39. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<39>>>
