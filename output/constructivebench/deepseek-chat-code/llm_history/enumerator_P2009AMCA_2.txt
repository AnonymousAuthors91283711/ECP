[write_program]
The problem is to evaluate the continued fraction expression 1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1)). This is a simple nested fraction that can be evaluated step by step. The Python program will compute this exact value as a fraction to avoid floating-point approximations.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def evaluate_continued_fraction():
    # Evaluate the denominator first: 1 + 1/(1 + 1)
    denominator = 1 + Fraction(1, 1 + 1)
    # Then evaluate the whole expression: 1 + 1/denominator
    result = 1 + Fraction(1, denominator)
    print(result)

evaluate_continued_fraction()
```
