theorem omnimath3381 : 
  List.foldr (fun (d : ℕ) (n : ℤ) => n * (-4) + d) 0 omnimath3381_answer = -2013 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3). Expected Answer Type: List ℕ
Looking at the enumerated answer (2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3) and the equation structure, this appears to be representing -2013 in a modified base (-4) system. The digits correspond to coefficients when expressing -2013 in base (-4). The answer should be the digits of 2013 in base 4, reversed.
