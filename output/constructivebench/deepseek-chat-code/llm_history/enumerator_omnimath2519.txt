This problem asks to find a 4-digit number (represented as digits a,b,c,d) that satisfies three linear equations. We'll enumerate all possible digit combinations (0-9) that satisfy the constraints and print the valid numbers.

```python
def solve():
    # Enumerate all possible digit combinations (a,b,c,d) where each is 0-9
    for a in range(0, 10):
        for b in range(0, 10):
            for c in range(0, 10):
                for d in range(0, 10):
                    # Check all three equations
                    eq1 = 6*a + 9*b + 3*c + d == 88
                    eq2 = a - b + c - d == -6
                    eq3 = a - 9*b + 3*c - d == -46
                    if eq1 and eq2 and eq3:
                        number = 1000*a + 100*b + 10*c + d
                        print(f"Found solution: {number}")
                        return  # Since we expect only one solution
    
    print("No solution found")

solve()
```
