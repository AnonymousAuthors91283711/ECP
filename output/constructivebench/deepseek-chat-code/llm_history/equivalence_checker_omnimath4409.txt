Ground Truth Answer: {Real.sqrt (4 / 3) ^ (1 / 3)}
Proposed Answer: {x : ℝ | x = (4/3)^(1/3)}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is close but not exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer. The ground truth answer uses `Real.sqrt (4/3)` while the proposed answer uses `(4/3)` directly. While `(4/3)^(1/3)` is indeed a solution to the equation `3 * x^3 - floor(x) = 3` (since for this value, floor(x) = 1), the ground truth answer is expressed in terms of square root rather than direct fractional exponentiation. The two expressions are mathematically equivalent (since `Real.sqrt (4/3) = (4/3)^(1/2)` and thus `(Real.sqrt (4/3))^(1/3) = (4/3)^(1/6)`, but this doesn't match the proposed answer), so there seems to be a discrepancy in the exact form of the solution.
