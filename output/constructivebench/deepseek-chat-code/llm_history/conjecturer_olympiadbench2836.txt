Maximum series sum: 1.333333. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the enumerated answers, we see that when T=32, the maximum sum is 1.333..., which corresponds to when cosθ=0.25. The proposed answer T/(T-sqrt(T²-64)) evaluates to 32/(32-√(1024-64)) = 32/(32-√960) ≈ 32/(32-30.9839) ≈ 32/1.0161 ≈ 31.493, which doesn't match the enumerated maximum.

Looking at the pattern, the maximum sum occurs when cosθ is positive (0.25). The infinite series sum ∑(cosθ)^n is a geometric series that converges to 1/(1-cosθ) when |cosθ|<1. From the problem, sinθ = √(T²-64)/T, so cosθ = √(1 - (T²-64)/T²) = √(64/T²) = 8/T.

Thus, the sum would be 1/(1 - 8/T) = T/(T-8). For T=32, this gives 32/24 ≈ 1.333..., matching the enumerated maximum.

<<<fun T : ℝ => T / (T - 8)>>>

The error in the original proposal was using T as a free variable in the abbreviation. We need to make it a function of T. The corrected form matches both the mathematical derivation and the enumerated results.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Maximum series sum: 1.333333. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the error message, we see that `olympiadbench2836_answer` should be of type ℝ (a real number), but the proposed answer is a function ℝ → ℝ. Looking at the enumerated answers when T=32, the maximum series sum is 1.333..., which equals 4/3. 

The pattern suggests the answer should be T/(T - sqrt(T^2 - 64)) when cosθ is positive (giving maximum sum). For T=32, sqrt(32^2-64)=sqrt(960)≈30.98386677, so 32/(32-30.98386677)≈4/3.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<fun T : ℝ => T / (T - sqrt (T^2 - 64))>>>

Explanation:
1. The series ∑(cosθ)^n converges to 1/(1-cosθ) when |cosθ|<1
2. From hθ, we get cosθ = ±8/T (using sin²θ + cos²θ = 1)
3. The maximum occurs when cosθ is positive (8/T)
4. Thus the maximum sum is 1/(1 - 8/T) = T/(T - 8)
5. But more precisely, cosθ = sqrt(1 - (T²-64)/T²) = sqrt(64)/T = 8/T
6. Hence the answer is T/(T - 8) when T>8, which matches the enumerated case T=32 (32/24=4/3)[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Maximum series sum: 1.333333. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the error message, we see that the proposed answer is a function (ℝ → ℝ) when it should be a concrete real number (ℝ). The problem provides a specific case where T=32, and we need to find the maximum value of the series sum.

Looking at the enumerated answers:
- When cosθ=0.25, sum=1.333...
- When cosθ=-0.25, sum=0.8

The maximum occurs when cosθ=0.25. The series sum for |r|<1 is 1/(1-r), where r=cosθ. Given sinθ=√(T²-64)/T=√(1024-64)/32=√960/32≈0.968, then cosθ=√(1-sin²θ)=√(1-0.9375)=0.25.

Thus the maximum sum is 1/(1-0.25) = 4/3 ≈ 1.333..., which matches the enumerated maximum.
