[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that for any factorization of 10^n into two natural numbers a and b, at least one of a or b must contain a digit 0 in base 10. We'll write a Python program to check this property for increasing values of n.

The approach:
1. For each n starting from 1, generate all factor pairs (a,b) of 10^n
2. Check if any pair exists where neither a nor b contains a '0' digit
3. The first n where no such pair exists is our answer

```python
def has_zero_digit(x):
    return '0' in str(x)

def check_n(n):
    target = 10 ** n
    # We only need to check divisors up to sqrt(target)
    max_a = int(target ** 0.5) + 1
    for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
        if target % a == 0:
            b = target // a
            if not has_zero_digit(a) and not has_zero_digit(b):
                return False
    return True

def find_min_n():
    n = 1
    while True:
        if check_n(n):
            print(f"Found candidate: {n}")
            return n
        n += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_n()
```
