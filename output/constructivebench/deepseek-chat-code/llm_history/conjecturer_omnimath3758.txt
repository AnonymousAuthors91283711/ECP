abbrev omnimath3758_answer : Set (ℝ → ℝ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3758
: {f : ℝ → ℝ | (∀ x : ℝ, f (x + 1) = f x + 1 ∧ f (x ^ 2) = (f x) ^ 2)} = omnimath3758_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found candidate: f(x) = x
Found candidate: f(x) = x + 0

After testing candidates, the only solution appears to be f(x) = x. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
<<<{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x, f x = x}>>>
