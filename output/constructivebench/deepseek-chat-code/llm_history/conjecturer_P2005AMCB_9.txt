abbrev P2005AMCB_9_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2005AMCB_9 : 
  let scores := [70, 80, 85, 90, 95]
  let weights := [0.1, 0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.3]
  let mean := ∑ i in Finset.range 5, weights[i]! * scores[i]!
  let median := 85
  mean - median = P2005AMCB_9_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Weighted sum: 86.0
Median: 85
Difference (mean - median): 1.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<1.0>>>
