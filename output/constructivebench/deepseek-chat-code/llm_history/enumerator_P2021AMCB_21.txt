[write_program]
This problem involves finding the sum of all positive real solutions to the equation x² = 2ˣ. We'll write a Python program to numerically approximate the solutions and their sum.

The equation x² = 2ˣ has three solutions:
1. x = 2 (exact solution)
2. x = 4 (exact solution)
3. A negative solution (not needed since we only want x > 0)
4. A solution between 0 and 1 (approximately 0.766665)

We'll use numerical methods to approximate the third positive solution and calculate the sum.

```python
def f(x):
    return x**2 - 2**x

# Find the root between 0 and 1 using binary search
def find_root():
    left, right = 0.5, 1.0
    for _ in range(100):  # Sufficient precision
        mid = (left + right) / 2
        if f(mid) > 0:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid
    return (left + right) / 2

# Calculate and print the solutions and their sum
root = find_root()
solutions = [2, 4, root]
print("Positive solutions to x^2 = 2^x:")
for x in solutions:
    print(f"x = {x}")

sum_solutions = sum(solutions)
print(f"\nSum of solutions: {sum_solutions}")
```
