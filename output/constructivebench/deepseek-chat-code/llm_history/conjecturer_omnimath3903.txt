abbrev omnimath3903_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3903
: {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (n.divisors).card^3 = 4*n} = omnimath3903_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for numbers n where d(n)^3 = 4n, up to n=10000:
Found solution: n = 2 (d(n) = 2)
Found solution: n = 128 (d(n) = 8)
Found solution: n = 2000 (d(n) = 20). Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{n | ∃ k : ℕ, n = 2 * k^3}>>>
