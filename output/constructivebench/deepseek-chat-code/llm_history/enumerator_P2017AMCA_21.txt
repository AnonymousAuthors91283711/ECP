[write_program]
This problem involves finding the cardinality of a set constructed through algebraic closure operations starting from {0, 10}. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible integer roots of polynomials with coefficients in the evolving sets.

The approach:
1. Start with initial set S0 = {0, 10}
2. Find all integer roots of non-zero polynomials with coefficients in S0 (S1)
3. Find all integer roots of non-zero polynomials with coefficients in S0 ∪ S1 (S2)
4. Take the union S0 ∪ S1 ∪ S2 and count distinct elements

We'll limit polynomial degree to 2 for practicality, as higher degrees become computationally intensive while unlikely to produce new roots in this context.

```python
def enumerate_solution():
    S0 = {0, 10}
    print(f"Initial set S0: {sorted(S0)}")
    
    def find_roots(coeff_set, max_degree=2):
        roots = set()
        # Generate all non-zero polynomials up to given degree with coefficients in coeff_set
        from itertools import product
        
        for degree in range(1, max_degree+1):
            for coeffs in product(coeff_set, repeat=degree+1):
                if all(c == 0 for c in coeffs):  # Skip zero polynomial
                    continue
                # Find integer roots
                for x in range(-100, 101):  # Reasonable search range
                    val = 0
                    for power, c in enumerate(coeffs):
                        val += c * (x ** power)
                    if val == 0:
                        roots.add(x)
        return roots
    
    S1 = find_roots(S0)
    print(f"Set S1 (roots of S0 polynomials): {sorted(S1)}")
    
    S01 = S0.union(S1)
    S2 = find_roots(S01)
    print(f"Set S2 (roots of S0∪S1 polynomials): {sorted(S2)}")
    
    S_closure = S0.union(S1).union(S2)
    print(f"Final set S_closure: {sorted(S_closure)}")
    print(f"Cardinality: {len(S_closure)}")

enumerate_solution()
```
