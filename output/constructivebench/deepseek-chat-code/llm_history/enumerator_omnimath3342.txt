[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of functions f: ℤ → Bool that satisfy two conditions:
1. Periodicity: f(x) = f(x+22) for all x ∈ ℤ
2. No two consecutive trues: There's no y ∈ ℤ where f(y) = true and f(y+2) = true

Since the functions are periodic with period 22, we can restrict our attention to one period. We need to count all binary sequences of length 22 where no two entries at distance 2 are both true (1). This is equivalent to counting independent sets in a cycle graph C₂₂ where edges connect vertices at distance 2.

Here's a Python program that enumerates all valid sequences for smaller cycle lengths to help identify the pattern, then computes the answer for n=22:

```python
def count_valid_sequences(n):
    # Counts binary sequences of length n with no two 1's at distance exactly 2
    # Uses dynamic programming for cycle graphs
    if n == 0: return 1
    if n == 1: return 2
    if n == 2: return 3
    
    # Linear case (path graph) dynamic programming
    # dp0[i] = count for first i elements ending with 0
    # dp1[i] = count for first i elements ending with 1
    dp0 = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp1 = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp0[1], dp1[1] = 1, 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp0[i] = dp0[i-1] + dp1[i-1]
        dp1[i] = dp0[i-1]
        if i > 2:
            dp1[i] += dp0[i-2] - dp0[i-1]  # Adjust for cycle
    
    # For cycle, we need to consider constraints at both ends
    # Total = (linear case) - invalid cases where first and last-1 are both 1
    linear_count = dp0[n] + dp1[n]
    
    # Count invalid cases where first and last-1 are both 1
    # We can compute this by forcing first and last-1 to be 1
    if n < 3: return linear_count
    invalid = 0
    if n >= 3:
        # First and third positions are 1, second is 0
        # Then count ways to fill positions 4..n-1
        if n == 3:
            invalid = 1
        else:
            # Equivalent to counting linear sequences of length n-4 with same constraints
            invalid = count_valid_sequences(n - 4)
    
    return linear_count - invalid

# Print counts for small n to observe pattern
for n in range(1, 15):
    print(f"n={n}: {count_valid_sequences(n)}")

# Compute and print the answer for n=22
print(f"Final answer for n=22: {count_valid_sequences(22)}")
```

The program first counts valid sequences for smaller cycle lengths to help identify the pattern, then computes the answer for n=22. The dynamic programming approach efficiently counts the sequences by considering the constraints. The output shows the progression of counts for smaller n values before revealing the final answer for n=22.
