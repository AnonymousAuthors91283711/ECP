[write_program]
The problem asks to find the value of k that makes the slope between two points (3, 2k+1) and (8, 4k-5) equal to zero. The slope between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is (y2-y1)/(x2-x1). Setting this to zero means y2-y1=0.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Symbolically compute the slope expression
2. Solve for k when slope equals zero
3. Verify the solution by plugging it back into the slope formula

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_k():
    k = symbols('k')
    # Points (3, 2k+1) and (8, 4k-5)
    slope = ((4*k - 5) - (2*k + 1)) / (8 - 3)
    # Set slope to zero and solve
    equation = Eq(slope, 0)
    solution = solve(equation, k)
    print(f"Found solution: k = {solution[0]}")
    
    # Verification
    verified_slope = slope.subs(k, solution[0])
    print(f"Verification - slope at k={solution[0]}: {verified_slope}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_k()
```
