[write_program]
The problem asks to find the sum of all numbers in a given set where the condition `a^6` does not divide `6^a`. We'll write a Python program to enumerate through the given set, check the divisibility condition, and sum the numbers that satisfy it.

```python
def main():
    candidates = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 27, 32, 36, 48, 54, 64, 72, 81, 96, 108, 128, 144, 162, 192, 216, 243, 256, 288, 324, 384, 432, 486, 512, 576, 648, 729, 768, 864, 972}
    total = 0
    
    for a in sorted(candidates):
        # Compute 6^a and a^6
        six_pow_a = 6 ** a
        a_pow_6 = a ** 6
        
        # Check if a^6 does not divide 6^a
        if six_pow_a % a_pow_6 != 0:
            print(f"Found candidate: {a}")
            total += a
    
    print(f"Final sum: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
