The problem asks to find the value of \(x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2}\) given that \(x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{13}{6}\). We can solve this by squaring the given equation and rearranging terms.

1. Start with \(x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{13}{6}\)
2. Square both sides: \((x + \frac{1}{x})^2 = (\frac{13}{6})^2\)
3. Expand left side: \(x^2 + 2 \cdot x \cdot \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2} = \frac{169}{36}\)
4. Simplify: \(x^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = \frac{169}{36}\)
5. Subtract 2 from both sides: \(x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = \frac{169}{36} - 2 = \frac{169}{36} - \frac{72}{36} = \frac{97}{36}\)

The Python program will verify this by enumerating possible rational values of x that satisfy the original equation and computing the target expression.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve():
    # We'll check rational x = p/q where |p|,|q| <= 20 to find solutions
    max_denominator = 20
    solutions = []
    
    for p in range(-20, 21):
        for q in range(1, max_denominator + 1):
            if p == 0:
                continue
            x = Fraction(p, q)
            if x + 1/x == Fraction(13, 6):
                solutions.append((x, x**2 + 1/(x**2)))
    
    # Print all found solutions and their x^2 + 1/x^2 values
    for x, val in solutions:
        print(f"x = {x}, x² + 1/x² = {val}")
    
    # The problem expects a single answer, so we'll print the first one found
    if solutions:
        print("\nFinal answer:", solutions[0][1])

solve()
```
