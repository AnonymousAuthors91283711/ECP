theorem omnimath276 :
  (∃ X : Set ℤ, ∀ n : ℤ, {p : ℤ × ℤ | p.1 + 2 * p.2 = n ∧ p.1 ∈ X ∧ p.2 ∈ X}.encard = 1) ↔ omnimath276_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No valid sets found in range [-3, 3]. Expected Answer Type: Prop
Based on the problem statement and the enumeration results, it appears that no such set X exists that satisfies the given condition for all integers n. The condition requires exactly one solution (p.1, p.2) in X×X for each linear equation p.1 + 2*p.2 = n, which seems impossible to satisfy across all integers n.
