This problem involves counting the number of 4×4 binary matrices where:
1. Each row sum equals σ(i)+1 for some permutation σ of {0,1,2,3}
2. Each column sum equals τ(j)+1 for some permutation τ of {0,1,2,3}

We'll enumerate all possible 4×4 binary matrices (there are 2^16=65536 possibilities) and count those satisfying the conditions. To optimize, we'll:
1. Generate all possible row sums (permutations of {1,2,3,4})
2. For each valid row sum combination, generate matrices with those row sums
3. Check if column sums also form a permutation of {1,2,3,4}

```python
from itertools import permutations, product

def solve():
    n = 4
    # All possible row sum permutations (1-4)
    row_perms = list(permutations(range(1, n+1)))
    count = 0
    
    for row_sums in row_perms:
        # Generate all possible rows with given sums
        possible_rows = []
        for s in row_sums:
            rows = []
            # Generate all binary vectors with sum s
            for bits in product([0,1], repeat=n):
                if sum(bits) == s:
                    rows.append(bits)
            possible_rows.append(rows)
        
        # Check all combinations of these rows
        for matrix in product(*possible_rows):
            # Check column sums
            col_sums = [0]*n
            for row in matrix:
                for j in range(n):
                    col_sums[j] += row[j]
            # Check if column sums are a permutation of 1-4
            if sorted(col_sums) == list(range(1, n+1)):
                count += 1
                print(f"Found valid matrix #{count}")
    
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

solve()
```
