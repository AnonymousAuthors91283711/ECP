Ground Truth Answer: {(-20, 28, 38), (-20, 38, 28), (28, -20, 38), (28, 38, -20), (38, -20, 28), (38, 28, -20)}
Proposed Answer: {(42, 13, 37), (42, 37, 13), (13, 42, 37), (13, 37, 42), (37, 42, 13), (37, 13, 42)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem states that for integers a, b, c, the set {(a+b)/2 + c, (a+c)/2 + b, (b+c)/2 + a} equals {42, 13, 37} if and only if (a,b,c) is in some solution set.

2. The ground truth answer gives triples where:
   - (-20 + 28)/2 + 38 = 8/2 + 38 = 4 + 38 = 42
   - (-20 + 38)/2 + 28 = 18/2 + 28 = 9 + 28 = 37
   - (28 + 38)/2 + (-20) = 66/2 - 20 = 33 - 20 = 13
   This correctly produces the set {42, 37, 13} which equals {42, 13, 37}

3. The proposed answer gives triples where:
   - (42 + 13)/2 + 37 = 55/2 + 37 = 27.5 + 37 (not integer)
   - This already fails because we need integer results

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the original equation (produces non-integer results and wrong values), while the ground truth does. They are not equivalent.
