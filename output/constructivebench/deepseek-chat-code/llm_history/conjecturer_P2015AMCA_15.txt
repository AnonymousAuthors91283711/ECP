Based on the problem statement, we're looking for the smallest n such that 123456789 * 10^n is divisible by 2²⁶ * 5⁴ with the remaining factor coprime to 10. Since 123456789 is odd, we need enough factors of 2 and 5 in 10^n to satisfy the divisibility condition. The limiting factor is the 2²⁶ requirement, as 10^n provides n factors of 2 and n factors of 5. We need n ≥ 26 to satisfy the 2²⁶ condition, and n ≥ 4 would satisfy the 5⁴ condition. Therefore, the minimal n is 26.

<<<26>>>
