Ground Truth Answer: 1/2
Proposed Answer: 4 / 6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimum value of the expression a/(b³+4) + b/(c³+4) + c/(d³+4) + d/(a³+4) under the constraints that a,b,c,d are non-negative and sum to 4.

2. The ground truth answer is 1/2 (which equals 0.5).

3. The proposed answer is 4/6 (which simplifies to ≈0.666...).

4. The proposed answer (0.666...) is greater than the ground truth answer (0.5), so it cannot be correct as a minimum value.

5. The correct minimum occurs when a=b=c=d=1, which gives:
   1/(1³+4) + 1/(1³+4) + 1/(1³+4) + 1/(1³+4) = 4/5 = 0.8
   But this is actually higher than both answers, suggesting the ground truth might be considering a different case.

6. However, the ground truth answer of 1/2 can be achieved by setting (a,b,c,d) = (2,2,0,0) or permutations thereof:
   2/(2³+4) + 2/(0³+4) + 0 + 0 = 2/12 + 2/4 = 1/6 + 1/2 ≈ 0.666..., which doesn't match 1/2.

This suggests there might be some confusion in either the ground truth or the proposed answer, but clearly 4/6 is not equal to 1/2.
