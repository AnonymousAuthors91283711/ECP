Ground Truth Answer: fun n => ∃ k, n = (2 * k)^2
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => ¬∃ k, n = 2^k
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves counting the number of divisors m of n (and n³) that satisfy a specific distance condition, and determining when this count is odd.

2. The ground truth answer states that A(n) is odd precisely when n is a square of an even number (n = (2k)²).

3. The proposed answer states that A(n) is odd when n is not a power of 2.

These are not equivalent:
- Counterexample for ground truth: n=4 (which is (2*1)²) would make A(n) odd
- Counterexample for proposed answer: n=4 (which is 2²) would make A(n) odd, but the proposed answer would claim it's even (since 4 is a power of 2)

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It fails on squares of even numbers (like 4, 16, 36) which should make A(n) odd
2. It incorrectly claims that all non-powers-of-2 make A(n) odd, when in fact only specific forms do
