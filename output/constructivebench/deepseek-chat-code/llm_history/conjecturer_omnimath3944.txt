Conjectured general solution: f(x,y) = a*x + b*y + c where a + b = 0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ × ℝ → ℝ
Looking at the enumerated answers, we can observe a clear pattern:
1. The coefficient of x and y are always negatives of each other (a = -b)
2. The constant term c is always 0
3. The solutions are linear functions

The error in the original proposed answer was using undefined variables 'a' and 'c'. We need to make these parameters explicit or use specific values. Based on the pattern, the simplest non-trivial solution would be f(x,y) = x - y.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<fun (x, y) => x - y>>>

Explanation:
1. The enumerated answers show that valid solutions have the form f(x,y) = k*(x - y) for some constant k
2. The simplest non-zero solution is when k=1
3. The condition a + b = 0 is satisfied since 1 + (-1) = 0
4. The constant term is 0 as observed in all enumerated cases
5. This satisfies the unit square condition since the sum of coordinates around any unit square will cancel out (x - y + (x+1) - y - (x+1) - (y+1) + x - (y+1) = 0)
