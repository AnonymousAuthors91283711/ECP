[write_program]
The problem asks for the count of numbers `k` between 1 and 20 (inclusive) such that `9` divides `k^2`. We'll write a Python program to enumerate these values and count them.

```python
def is_divisible_by_9_squared(k):
    return (k * k) % 9 == 0

count = 0
for k in range(1, 21):
    if is_divisible_by_9_squared(k):
        print(f"{k}^2 is divisible by 9")
        count += 1

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
