This problem asks for coprime integers m and n such that the product of (1 - 1/(i+2)) for i from 0 to 6 equals m/n, and 100m + n = 108. We'll enumerate possible (m,n) pairs satisfying the constraints.

The approach:
1. Calculate the exact product value
2. Find m,n where m/n equals this product in lowest terms
3. Check if 100m + n = 108

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from math import gcd

def compute_product():
    product = Fraction(1, 1)
    for i in range(7):
        term = 1 - Fraction(1, i+2)
        product *= term
    return product

def find_solution():
    product = compute_product()
    # product is already in reduced form
    m, n = product.numerator, product.denominator
    if 100 * m + n == 108:
        print(f"Found solution: m={m}, n={n}")
        return (m, n)
    else:
        print(f"No solution found for product {product}")
        return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solution()
```
