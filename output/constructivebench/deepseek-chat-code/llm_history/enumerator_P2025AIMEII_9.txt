[write_program]
This problem involves counting the number of zeros and points where the derivative is zero for a trigonometric function. We'll write a Python program to numerically estimate these counts by sampling points in the interval (0, 2π) and checking conditions.

The approach:
1. Sample points densely in (0, 2π)
2. Find where sin(7π sin(5x)) ≈ 0 (zeros)
3. Check where the numerical derivative is approximately 0 (tangent points)
4. Count both sets and sum them

```python
import numpy as np

def main():
    n_samples = 100000  # High resolution for accuracy
    x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, n_samples, endpoint=False)
    f = lambda x: np.sin(7*np.pi * np.sin(5*x))
    y = f(x)
    
    # Find zeros (sign changes)
    zero_crossings = np.where(np.diff(np.sign(y)))[0]
    zeros = x[zero_crossings]
    
    # Numerical derivative
    h = 2*np.pi/n_samples
    df = (f(x + h) - f(x - h))/(2*h)
    
    # Find tangent points (zeros where derivative is near zero)
    tangent_mask = np.abs(df[zero_crossings]) < 1e-4
    tangent_points = zeros[tangent_mask]
    
    print(f"Number of zeros: {len(zeros)}")
    print(f"Number of tangent points: {len(tangent_points)}")
    print(f"Sum: {len(zeros) + len(tangent_points)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
