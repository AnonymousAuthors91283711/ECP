Ground Truth Answer: fun n => if n = 0 then 0 else 2
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n = 1 then 1 else 2
Let me analyze this carefully.

1. The problem is about determining the rank of a specific n×n matrix A where A_ij = (i+1) + (j+1) when cast to rational numbers.

2. For n=0: The matrix is empty, so rank should be 0. Ground truth handles this correctly, proposed answer doesn't explicitly handle n=0 but Lean would treat it as the "else" case (2), which is incorrect.

3. For n=1: The matrix is [4], which has rank 1. Ground truth says 2 (incorrect), proposed answer says 1 (correct).

4. For n≥2: The matrix has rank 2 since rows are linear combinations of (1,1,...,1) and (2,3,...,n+1). Both answers agree on this.

The proposed answer is more correct than the ground truth for n=1, but fails for n=0. The ground truth is correct for n=0 but wrong for n=1.
