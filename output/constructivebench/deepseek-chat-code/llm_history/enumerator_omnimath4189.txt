[write_program]
This problem appears to be about classifying prime numbers greater than 2 into three categories based on some game outcome (Ingrid, Draw, or Erik). The theorem suggests that for primes 3 and 5 the outcome is "Ingrid", for 7 it's "Draw", and for primes >7 it's "Erik".

Since we don't know the exact game rules, we'll write a program that:
1. Generates odd primes > 2
2. For each prime, determines its classification based on the given pattern
3. Outputs the results in a streaming fashion

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if n is a prime number"""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def classify_prime(p):
    """Classify prime according to the given pattern"""
    if p == 3 or p == 5:
        return "Ingrid"
    elif p == 7:
        return "Draw"
    elif p > 7:
        return "Erik"
    else:
        return None

# Enumerate odd primes > 2 up to a reasonable limit
max_prime = 50  # Adjust this if needed
print("Prime\tOutcome")
print("-----\t-------")
for p in range(3, max_prime + 1, 2):
    if is_prime(p):
        outcome = classify_prime(p)
        if outcome is not None:
            print(f"{p}\t{outcome}")
```
