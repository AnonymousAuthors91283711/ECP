Looking at the problem and the enumerated answers, we can observe that the equation involves trigonometric functions and has multiple roots. The problem asks for a condition where there are two distinct roots in (0,π) for the given equation.

The key insight comes from analyzing the trigonometric equation:
a*(sin x + sin(2x)) = sin(3x)

Using trigonometric identities, we can rewrite sin(3x) as:
sin(3x) = 3sinx - 4sin³x

And sin(2x) as:
sin(2x) = 2sinx cosx

The equation becomes:
a*(sinx + 2sinx cosx) = 3sinx - 4sin³x

For sinx ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by sinx:
a*(1 + 2cosx) = 3 - 4sin²x

Using sin²x = 1 - cos²x:
a*(1 + 2cosx) = 3 - 4(1 - cos²x)
a + 2a cosx = -1 + 4cos²x
4cos²x - 2a cosx - (a + 1) = 0

This is a quadratic in cosx. For two distinct roots in (0,π), we need the quadratic to have two distinct solutions in (-1,1). The sum of the roots of the quadratic is p + q + r = 2a/4 = a/2. However, we need to consider the case when sinx = 0 is also a solution (x=0 or π, but these are excluded by the interval).

The correct sum appears to be related to the roots of the equation, and from the pattern, we can see it's likely 0 (since the sum of roots of the quadratic is a/2, but we need to consider the full solution set).
