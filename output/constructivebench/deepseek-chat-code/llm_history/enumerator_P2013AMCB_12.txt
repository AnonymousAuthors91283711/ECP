The problem asks for the number of valid trails between points A (0) and B (1) in a given graph with specific roads (edges). A valid trail must use each road exactly once, start at A, end at B, and have no repeated edges.

We'll enumerate all possible trails that meet these criteria by:
1. Representing the graph as an adjacency list
2. Implementing a depth-first search that tracks used edges
3. Counting all valid trails from A to B that use each edge exactly once

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def enumerate_trails():
    # Define the graph (undirected)
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    roads = [(0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,4)]
    for u, v in roads:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
    
    # Convert roads to frozensets for easy comparison
    all_edges = {frozenset(road) for road in roads}
    
    count = 0
    
    def dfs(current, used_edges, path):
        nonlocal count
        if len(used_edges) == len(roads):
            if current == 1:  # Reached B
                count += 1
                print(f"Found valid trail #{count}")
            return
        
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            edge = frozenset({current, neighbor})
            if edge not in used_edges and edge in all_edges:
                new_used = used_edges.copy()
                new_used.add(edge)
                dfs(neighbor, new_used, path + [edge])
    
    # Start from A (0) with no edges used
    dfs(0, set(), [])
    
    print(f"Total valid trails: {count}")

enumerate_trails()
```
