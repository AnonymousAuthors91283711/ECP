abbrev omnimath1594_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1594 :
  {n : ℕ | n < 100 ∧ (n ∣ 2 ^ n + 2)} = omnimath1594_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 1
2
6
66
Complete list: [1, 2, 6, 66]. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{n : ℕ | n ∣ 2} ∪ {n : ℕ | n ∣ 6} ∪ {n : ℕ | n ∣ 66}>>> 

Explanation: The enumerated answers [1,2,6,66] are all divisors of 66, plus 1 (which divides everything). The pattern suggests the solution set consists of divisors of 2, 6, or 66. This covers all found cases while remaining general. The union of these divisor sets gives the complete solution.
