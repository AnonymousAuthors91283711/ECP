[write_program]
This problem involves finding all prime numbers p for which the cubic equation x^3 - 3x + 1 = 0 has exactly one solution in ZMod p. We'll write a Python program to enumerate primes and count the roots of this equation modulo each prime.

The approach is:
1. Generate primes up to a reasonable limit (we'll use 100)
2. For each prime, test all possible values in ZMod p as roots
3. Count how many distinct roots satisfy the equation
4. Output primes with exactly one root

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]:
        if n % p == 0:
            return n == p
    d = n - 1
    s = 0
    while d % 2 == 0:
        d //= 2
        s += 1
    for a in [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]:
        if a >= n:
            continue
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(s - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False
    return True

def count_roots(p):
    count = 0
    for x in range(p):
        val = (x**3 - 3*x + 1) % p
        if val == 0:
            count += 1
    return count

max_prime = 100
print(f"Searching primes up to {max_prime} where x^3-3x+1 has exactly one root:")
for p in range(2, max_prime + 1):
    if is_prime(p):
        roots = count_roots(p)
        if roots == 1:
            print(p)
```
