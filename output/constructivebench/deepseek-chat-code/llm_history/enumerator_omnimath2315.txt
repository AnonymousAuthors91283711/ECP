This problem asks for the number of non-empty subsets of the Cartesian product Fin 3 × Fin 2, which is equivalent to counting all non-empty subsets of a 3×2 grid. The total number of subsets is 2^(3*2) = 64, and subtracting 1 for the empty set gives 63 non-empty subsets.

Here's a Python program that enumerates and counts all non-empty subsets of a 3×2 grid:

```python
from itertools import product, combinations

def main():
    # Create all elements of the grid (Fin 3 × Fin 2)
    grid = list(product(range(3), range(2)))
    
    # Count all non-empty subsets
    count = 0
    for size in range(1, len(grid)+1):
        for subset in combinations(grid, size):
            count += 1
            # Print first few subsets to demonstrate enumeration
            if count <= 5:
                print(f"Subset {count}: {subset}")
    
    print(f"Total non-empty subsets: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program:
1. Creates all elements of the 3×2 grid using product()
2. Uses combinations() to generate all possible subsets of each size
3. Counts all non-empty subsets (from size 1 to 6)
4. Prints the first few subsets as examples
5. Outputs the total count of non-empty subsets

The output will show that there are exactly 63 non-empty subsets, which matches the mathematical calculation (2^6 - 1 = 63).
