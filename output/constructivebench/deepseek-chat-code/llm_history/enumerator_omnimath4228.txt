[write_program]
This problem asks for which natural numbers n there exists an integer x such that x^n + (2+x)^n + (2-x)^n = 0. We'll write a Python program to enumerate small values of n and check for solutions.

The approach:
1. Iterate n from 1 upwards
2. For each n, check integer x values in a reasonable range (since large |x| makes the terms grow rapidly)
3. Print n if any x satisfies the equation
4. Stop after checking up to n=20 (since higher exponents are unlikely to have solutions)

```python
def check_equation(n, x):
    return x**n + (2 + x)**n + (2 - x)**n == 0

max_n = 20
x_range = range(-10, 11)  # Check x values from -10 to 10

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    found = False
    for x in x_range:
        if check_equation(n, x):
            print(f"n = {n} has solution x = {x}")
            found = True
            break
    if not found:
        print(f"n = {n}: no solution found in x âˆˆ [{x_range[0]}, {x_range[-1]}]")
```
