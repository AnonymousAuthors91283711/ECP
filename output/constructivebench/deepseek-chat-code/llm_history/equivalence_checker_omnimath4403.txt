Ground Truth Answer: (1, 1/2, -1/2, 1/3)
Proposed Answer: (4, 1, 1/2, 0)
Let's analyze the proposed answer (4, 1, 1/2, 0) against the ground truth (1, 1/2, -1/2, 1/3) by checking each equation:

1. First equation: √x - 1/y - 2w + 3z = 1
   - Ground truth: √1 - 2 - 2*(-1/2) + 3*(1/3) = 1 - 2 + 1 + 1 = 1 ✔
   - Proposed: √4 - 1 - 2*(1/2) + 3*0 = 2 - 1 - 1 + 0 = 0 ≠ 1 ✖

2. Second equation: x + 1/y² - 4w² - 9z² = 3
   - Ground truth: 1 + 4 - 4*(1/4) - 9*(1/9) = 1 + 4 - 1 - 1 = 3 ✔
   - Proposed: 4 + 1 - 4*(1/4) - 9*0 = 4 + 1 - 1 - 0 = 4 ≠ 3 ✖

3. Third equation: x√x - 1/y³ - 8w³ + 27z³ = -5
   - Ground truth: 1 - 8 - 8*(-1/8) + 27*(1/27) = 1 - 8 + 1 + 1 = -5 ✔
   - Proposed: 8 - 1 - 8*(1/8) + 0 = 8 - 1 - 1 + 0 = 6 ≠ -5 ✖

4. Fourth equation: x² + 1/y⁴ - 16w⁴ - 81z⁴ = 15
   - Ground truth: 1 + 16 - 16*(1/16) - 81*(1/81) = 1 + 16 - 1 - 1 = 15 ✔
   - Proposed: 16 + 1 - 16*(1/16) - 0 = 16 + 1 - 1 - 0 = 16 ≠ 15 ✖

The proposed answer fails all four equations, while the ground truth satisfies all of them.
