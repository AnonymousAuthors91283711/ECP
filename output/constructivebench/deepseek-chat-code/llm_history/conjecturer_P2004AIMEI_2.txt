abbrev P2004AIMEI_2_answer : ℤ := sorry
theorem P2004AIMEI_2 (m : ℤ) (hm : 0 < m) :
  (∃ (a : ℤ), (∑ k in Finset.range m.toNat, (a + k)) = 2 * m) ∧
  (∃ (b : ℤ), (∑ k in Finset.range (2 * m).toNat, (b + k)) = m) ∧
  |(a + m - 1) - (b + 2 * m - 1)| = 99 ↔ m = P2004AIMEI_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerated all candidates up to m=200. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
From the problem statement and enumerated pattern, we observe that the solution involves finding m where the difference between two arithmetic series results in 99. The pattern suggests m is half of 99 plus/minus 1. The correct solution is:

<<<49>>>
