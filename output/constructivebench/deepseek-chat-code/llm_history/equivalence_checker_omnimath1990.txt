Ground Truth Answer: 1481480
Proposed Answer: 27050
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number N > 2017 where:
   - The count of numbers < N that start with digit 1 (when written in base 10)
   - Multiplied by 5 equals 2*N

2. The ground truth answer is 1,481,480
3. The proposed answer is 27,050

Let's do a quick sanity check:
- For numbers up to 27,050, the count of numbers starting with 1 would be roughly 1/9 of them (by Benford's Law approximation), but actually slightly more since 1 gets more than its fair share in lower ranges.
- 5 * (expected count) ≈ 5 * (27050/9) ≈ 15,027
- 2 * 27050 = 54,100
These are not equal, so 27,050 cannot be correct.

The ground truth answer 1,481,480 is much larger and would satisfy the condition better due to the distribution of leading digits stabilizing at higher numbers.
