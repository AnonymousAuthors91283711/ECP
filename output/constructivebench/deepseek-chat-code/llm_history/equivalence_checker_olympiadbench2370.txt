theorem olympiadbench2370 :
  {x : ℝ | (x + 8) ^ 4 = (2 * x + 16) ^ 2} = olympiadbench2370_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {-6, -8, -10}
Proposed Answer: {-10, -8, -6}
<<<True>>>
The two answers are equivalent because they contain the same elements, just in a different order. The set {-6, -8, -10} is identical to {-10, -8, -6} since sets are unordered collections of unique elements. The order of elements in a set does not affect its identity or equality.
