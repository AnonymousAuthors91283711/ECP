Ground Truth Answer: fun a b c => (1 / (a + 1)) + (1 / (b + 1)) + (1 / (c + 1))
Proposed Answer: fun a b c : ℂ => a^3 + b^3 + c^3
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a cubic equation (X-a)(X-b)(X-c) = X³ - X + 1, which means a, b, c are roots of X³ - X + 1 = 0.

2. The ground truth answer computes the sum of reciprocals of (a+1), (b+1), (c+1).

3. The proposed answer computes the sum of cubes of the roots.

From Vieta's formulas for X³ - X + 1 = 0:
- a + b + c = 0
- ab + ac + bc = -1
- abc = -1

For the ground truth answer:
Using partial fractions and Vieta's, we can show that 1/(a+1) + 1/(b+1) + 1/(c+1) = -2.

For the proposed answer:
Using a³ = a - 1 (since a is a root), we get a³ + b³ + c³ = (a+b+c) - 3 = 0 - 3 = -3.

The two answers give different results (-2 vs -3), so they are not equivalent.
