[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of distinct real solutions θ in the interval (0, 2π] that satisfy the equation 5cos(3θ) = 3sinθ - 1. We'll write a Python program to numerically find and count these solutions by evaluating the equation at many points in the interval and checking for sign changes.

The approach:
1. Sample the interval (0, 2π] at small increments
2. Evaluate f(θ) = 5cos(3θ) - 3sinθ + 1
3. Count sign changes (indicating roots) and verify roots by checking nearby points
4. Ensure we don't double-count roots by checking proximity to previously found roots

```python
import math

def find_roots():
    roots = []
    step = 0.0001  # Small step size for accuracy
    threshold = 1e-6  # Threshold for considering a root
    prev_value = None
    
    # Evaluate at many points in (0, 2π]
    for theta in [x * step for x in range(1, int(2 * math.pi / step) + 1)]:
        f = 5 * math.cos(3 * theta) - 3 * math.sin(theta) + 1
        if prev_value is not None and f * prev_value <= 0:
            # Sign change detected, find root more precisely
            a = theta - step
            b = theta
            for _ in range(20):  # Binary search refinement
                mid = (a + b) / 2
                f_mid = 5 * math.cos(3 * mid) - 3 * math.sin(mid) + 1
                if abs(f_mid) < threshold:
                    # Check if this root is distinct from previous ones
                    if not any(abs(mid - r) < 0.01 for r in roots):
                        roots.append(mid)
                        print(f"Found root at θ ≈ {mid:.4f} radians ({mid/math.pi:.4f}π)")
                    break
                elif f_mid * (5 * math.cos(3 * a) - 3 * math.sin(a) + 1) < 0:
                    b = mid
                else:
                    a = mid
        prev_value = f
    
    print(f"\nTotal distinct roots found: {len(roots)}")

find_roots()
```
