Ground Truth Answer: 987^2 + 1597^2
Proposed Answer: 3524578
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the maximum value of m² + n² where m,n are integers between 1 and 1981, and they satisfy (n² - mn - m²)² = 1.

2. The equation (n² - mn - m²)² = 1 is related to Fibonacci numbers, as pairs of consecutive Fibonacci numbers satisfy this equation.

3. Looking at Fibonacci numbers:
   - 987 is the 16th Fibonacci number (F₁₆)
   - 1597 is the 17th Fibonacci number (F₁₇)
   - These are the largest consecutive Fibonacci pairs where both are ≤ 1981

4. Calculating 987² + 1597² = 974169 + 2550409 = 3524578

5. The proposed answer is exactly this value (3524578).

The proposed answer matches exactly with the calculation based on the ground truth answer.
