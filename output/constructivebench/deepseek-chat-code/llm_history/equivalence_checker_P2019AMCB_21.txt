Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the number of quadratic polynomials p(x) with real coefficients where:
   - The polynomial has degree exactly 2
   - It has two distinct real roots r and s
   - The set of coefficients {a₂, a₁, a₀} equals the set of roots {r, s}

2. The ground truth answer is 4, which comes from considering all possible cases where the coefficients can be equal to the roots in different permutations.

3. The proposed answer is 2, which would only account for some of the possible cases but misses others.

The correct count should be 4 because there are more valid configurations than the proposed answer accounts for. For example:
- p(x) = (x-a)(x-b) where coefficients are {1, -(a+b), ab} and we need this set to equal {a,b}
- This leads to multiple valid cases that satisfy the conditions.
