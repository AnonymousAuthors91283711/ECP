This problem appears to be about calculating a simple ratio expressed as a percentage. The mathematical expression given is (30 / (100 - 25)) * 100, which simplifies to (30 / 75) * 100 = 40. 

Since this is a straightforward calculation, we don't need enumeration. Instead, we'll compute the exact value directly in Python using rational arithmetic to maintain precision.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_answer():
    numerator = 30
    denominator = 100 - 25
    percentage = Fraction(numerator, denominator) * 100
    return percentage

answer = compute_answer()
print(f"The exact value is {answer}")
print(f"Decimal approximation: {float(answer)}")
```
