Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2 * n - 1) / 5
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n / 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the maximum number of pairs (a,b) where:
   - All pairs have distinct first elements, second elements, and sums
   - Each pair satisfies a + b ≤ n
   - We need to find the greatest possible number of such pairs

2. The ground truth answer suggests the formula (2n-1)/5, which would give:
   - For n=1: 0.2 → 0 (since we need integers)
   - For n=3: 1 → matches (only (1,2) possible)
   - For n=6: 2.2 → 2 (matches (1,5) and (2,3))

3. The proposed answer is n/2, which would give:
   - For n=1: 0.5 → 0 (matches)
   - For n=3: 1.5 → 1 (matches)
   - But for n=6: 3 (but only 2 pairs possible as above)

The proposed answer overcounts for larger n. The ground truth answer is more precise.
