[write_program]
This problem involves analyzing a recursive sequence defined by a specific rule (nextTerm) and asking for the 100th term when starting with 16. The sequence alternates between two operations based on whether the current term is even or odd. We'll write a Python program to compute this sequence up to the 100th term.

The program will:
1. Define the nextTerm function according to the given rules
2. Compute the sequence up to term 100 starting with 16
3. Print each term in the sequence (though we'll limit output to key terms to stay under token limit)
4. Finally output the 100th term

```python
def next_term(n):
    return (n // 2 + 1) if n % 2 == 0 else ((n + 1) // 2)

def compute_sequence(init, steps):
    sequence = [init]
    for _ in range(steps):
        sequence.append(next_term(sequence[-1]))
    return sequence

# Compute the sequence up to 100 terms starting with 16
sequence = compute_sequence(16, 100)

# Print selected terms to observe the pattern
for i in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]:
    print(f"Term {i}: {sequence[i]}")

# Output the final answer (100th term)
print("\nFinal answer (100th term):", sequence[100])
```
