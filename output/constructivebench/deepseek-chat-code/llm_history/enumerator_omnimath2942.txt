[write_program]
This problem is about finding natural numbers `k` such that `3 + 11*k` equals some unknown answer (represented by `omnimath2942_answer`). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of `k` and compute `3 + 11*k` to help identify patterns or potential answers.

The program will:
1. Iterate through possible values of `k` from 0 upwards
2. For each `k`, compute `3 + 11*k`
3. Print each result to help identify potential patterns
4. Stop after a reasonable number of iterations to avoid infinite output

```python
def enumerate_answers():
    max_k = 20  # Reasonable upper bound for demonstration
    print(f"Enumerating 3 + 11*k for k from 0 to {max_k}:")
    for k in range(max_k + 1):
        result = 3 + 11 * k
        print(f"k={k}: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_answers()
```
