[write_program]
The problem is to compute the value of the expression 1 / (1/2 + 2/3). This is a simple arithmetic calculation that can be done exactly. The Python program should compute and print the exact value as a fraction, then optionally show the decimal approximation.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Compute 1 / (1/2 + 2/3) exactly as a fraction
numerator = 1
denominator = Fraction(1, 2) + Fraction(2, 3)
result = numerator / denominator

# Print exact fraction and decimal approximation
print(f"Exact value: {result}")
print(f"Decimal approximation: {float(result)}")
```
