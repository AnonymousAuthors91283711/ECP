[write_program]
The problem asks to find all positive real numbers \( b \) such that for the complex number \( z = 9 + b i \), the imaginary parts of \( z^2 \) and \( z^3 \) are equal. We need to solve \( \text{Im}(z^2) = \text{Im}(z^3) \).

The approach is:
1. Compute \( z^2 \) and \( z^3 \) symbolically.
2. Extract the imaginary parts of both expressions.
3. Solve the equation \( \text{Im}(z^2) = \text{Im}(z^3) \) for \( b > 0 \).

The program will compute the symbolic expressions and solve the equation numerically for small values of \( b \) to find the solution.

```python
import sympy as sp

def find_b():
    b = sp.symbols('b', real=True, positive=True)
    z = 9 + b * sp.I
    z_squared = z**2
    z_cubed = z**3
    
    im_z2 = sp.im(z_squared)
    im_z3 = sp.im(z_cubed)
    
    equation = sp.Eq(im_z2, im_z3)
    solutions = sp.solve(equation, b)
    
    for sol in solutions:
        if sol > 0:
            print(sol)
