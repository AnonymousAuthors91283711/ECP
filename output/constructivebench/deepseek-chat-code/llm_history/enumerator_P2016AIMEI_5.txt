[write_program]
This problem involves finding natural numbers n, t, k that satisfy several equations. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of k (since it appears in both equations) and check the conditions.

The approach:
1. From n + k = 374, we get n = 374 - k
2. The second equation can be rewritten as (2t + k)(k + 1) = 638
3. We'll iterate k from 1 to 373 (since n must be positive)
4. For each k, check if 638 is divisible by (k + 1)
5. If divisible, compute 2t + k = 638/(k + 1)
6. Solve for t and check if it's a positive integer
7. Finally compute n + t and collect all valid results

```python
def solve():
    results = []
    for k in range(1, 374):
        denominator = k + 1
        if 638 % denominator != 0:
            continue
        quotient = 638 // denominator
        # 2t + k = quotient => t = (quotient - k)/2
        numerator = quotient - k
        if numerator <= 0 or numerator % 2 != 0:
            continue
        t = numerator // 2
        n = 374 - k
        if n <= 0:
            continue
        results.append(n + t)
    
    print("All valid n + t values:")
    for val in sorted(results):
        print(val)
    
    if results:
        print("\nMinimum n + t:", min(results))
        print("Maximum n + t:", max(results))

solve()
```
