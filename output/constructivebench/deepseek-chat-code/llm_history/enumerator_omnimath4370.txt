[write_program]
This problem asks to find a set of 100 distinct natural numbers where one of them is equal to the sum of cubes of the other 99 numbers. We'll write a Python program to search for such sets with small numbers first.

The approach:
1. Generate candidate sets of increasing size
2. For each set, check if any element equals the sum of cubes of others
3. Since 100 is large, we'll demonstrate the concept with smaller set sizes first

```python
import itertools

def find_cubic_set(max_n, set_size):
    """Search for sets where one element equals sum of cubes of others"""
    numbers = range(1, max_n + 1)
    
    # Try all possible combinations of set_size distinct numbers
    for candidate in itertools.combinations(numbers, set_size):
        total = sum(x**3 for x in candidate)
        for m in candidate:
            if m**3 == total - m**3:  # Check if m^3 equals sum of others' cubes
                print(f"Found set: {candidate} with m={m}")
                return
    
    print(f"No set found up to {max_n}")

# Demonstrate with small set sizes first
for size in [3, 4, 5]:
    print(f"\nSearching for set size {size}:")
    find_cubic_set(50, size)

# For the actual problem (set size 100), we'd need a smarter approach
print("\nNote: For set size 100, a mathematical construction would be needed")
```
