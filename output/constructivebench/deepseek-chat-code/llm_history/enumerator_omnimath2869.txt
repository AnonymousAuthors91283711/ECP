[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of equations with two-digit numbers where digits are swapped. We'll write a Python program to find all possible digit pairs (x,y) that satisfy the given equations, then compute x + y.

The equations are:
1. 10x + y = 75
2. 10y + x = 57

We'll iterate through all possible digit values (1-9 for x and y since they must be positive) to find pairs that satisfy both equations.

```python
def solve_problem():
    print("Searching for (x,y) pairs that satisfy:")
    print("10x + y = 75")
    print("10y + x = 57")
    print()
    
    found = False
    for x in range(1, 10):  # x must be positive digit
        for y in range(1, 10):  # y must be positive digit
            if (10*x + y == 75) and (10*y + x == 57):
                print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}")
                print(f"x + y = {x + y}")
                found = True
                break
        if found:
            break
    
    if not found:
        print("No solution found")

solve_problem()
