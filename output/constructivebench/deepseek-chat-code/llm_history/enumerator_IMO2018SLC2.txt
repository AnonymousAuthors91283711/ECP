[write_program]
The problem is about finding the maximum number K of non-attacking knights on an infinite chessboard such that there exists a function f that can place a queen not attacking any knight, regardless of how the K knights are placed (as long as they don't attack each other). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible K values and verify the conditions.

```python
def attacks_knight(p, q):
    x1, y1 = p
    x2, y2 = q
    dx = x1 - x2
    dy = y1 - y2
    return (dx*dx + dy*dy == 5) and (dx != 0 or dy != 0)

def attacks_queen(p, q):
    x1, y1 = p
    x2, y2 = q
    return x1 == x2 or y1 == y2 or abs(x1 - x2) == abs(y1 - y2)

def is_valid_knight_configuration(knights):
    for i in range(len(knights)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(knights)):
            if attacks_knight(knights[i], knights[j]):
                return False
    return True

def can_place_queen(knights):
    # Try center of mass first (common heuristic)
    if knights:
        avg_x = sum(k[0] for k in knights) / len(knights)
        avg_y = sum(k[1] for k in knights) / len(knights)
        candidates = [
            (int(avg_x), int(avg_y)),
            (int(avg_x)+1, int(avg_y)),
            (int(avg_x), int(avg_y)+1),
            (int(avg_x)+1, int(avg_y)+1)
        ]
        for q in candidates:
            if all(not attacks_queen(q, k) for k in knights) and q not in knights:
                return True
    
    # If center doesn't work, try other positions near knights
    for k in knights:
        for dx in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
            for dy in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
                q = (k[0]+dx, k[1]+dy)
                if all(not attacks_queen(q, k2) for k2 in knights) and q not in knights:
                    return True
    return False

max_k = 0
for K in range(1, 10):
    print(f"Testing K = {K}")
    # Generate some knight configurations (simplified for demonstration)
    # In practice, we'd need more sophisticated generation
    test_configs = [
        [(0,0), (1,2), (2,4), (3,6)],  # Diagonal line
        [(0,0), (2,1), (4,2), (6,3)],  # Another diagonal
        [(0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)],   # Square
        [(i, 0) for i in range(K)],     # Horizontal line
        [(0, i) for i in range(K)],     # Vertical line
    ]
    
    valid = True
    for config in test_configs:
        if len(config) == K and is_valid_knight_configuration(config):
            if not can_place_queen(config):
                valid = False
                break
    
    if valid:
        print(f"K = {K} works for tested configurations")
        max_k = K
    else:
        print(f"K = {K} fails for some configurations")
        break

print(f"Maximum K found: {max_k}")
```
