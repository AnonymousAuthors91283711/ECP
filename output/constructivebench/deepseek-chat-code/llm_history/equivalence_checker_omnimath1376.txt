Ground Truth Answer: fun x => (log (x / (x - 1))) / 2
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℚ => (1/2) * (log |x| + log |1 - x|)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer is: (log (x / (x - 1))) / 2
The proposed answer is: (1/2) * (log |x| + log |1 - x|)

Let's simplify the ground truth answer:
(log (x / (x - 1))) / 2 = (log x - log (x - 1)) / 2
= (log |x| - log |x - 1|) / 2  [since we're dealing with absolute values]

The proposed answer expands to:
(1/2) * (log |x| + log |1 - x|) = (log |x| + log |1 - x|) / 2

Now compare:
Ground truth: (log |x| - log |x - 1|)/2
Proposed: (log |x| + log |1 - x|)/2

These would be equal if -log|x-1| = +log|1-x|, which is true because |x-1| = |1-x|. Therefore:
-log|x-1| = -log|1-x| = log(1/|1-x|), which is NOT equal to log|1-x|.

Wait, no - actually, since |x-1| = |1-x|, then -log|x-1| = -log|1-x|, which is different from +log|1-x| in the proposed answer.

Therefore, the two expressions are not equivalent. The proposed answer has a sign error.
