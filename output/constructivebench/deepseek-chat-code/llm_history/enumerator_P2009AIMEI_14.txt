[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimal possible value of S₂ = ∑(a_i)^2 where a_i ∈ {1,2,3,4}, ∑a_i = 513, and ∑(a_i)^4 = 4745, with 350 terms. We'll enumerate possible combinations of counts for each digit (1-4) that satisfy the constraints.

```python
from itertools import product

def solve():
    n = 350
    total_sum = 513
    fourth_power_sum = 4745
    
    # Let x,y,z,w be counts of 1,2,3,4 respectively
    for x in range(0, n+1):
        for y in range(0, n+1 - x):
            remaining = n - x - y
            for z in range(0, remaining + 1):
                w = n - x - y - z
                
                # Check sum constraints
                if (x + 2*y + 3*z + 4*w) != total_sum:
                    continue
                if (x + 16*y + 81*z + 256*w) != fourth_power_sum:
                    continue
                
                # Calculate S₂
                s2 = x + 4*y + 9*z + 16*w
                print(f"Solution found: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, w={w}, S₂={s2}")
                
                # Since we're looking for minimal S₂, we can stop after first solution
                # because we're enumerating in order of increasing w (fewer 4s)
                return

solve()
