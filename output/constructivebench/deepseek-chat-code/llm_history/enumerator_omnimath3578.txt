[write_program]
This problem asks for natural numbers n where there exist positive integers a, b, c with gcd(a,b,c)=1 such that n = gcd(ab+c, ac-b) and n = a+b+c. We'll write a Python program to enumerate such n values by checking small triples (a,b,c).

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible values of n
2. For each n, iterate through possible a,b where a+b < n
3. Compute c = n-a-b and check if c > 0
4. Verify gcd conditions and the equation gcd(ab+c, ac-b) = n
5. Print valid n values as they're found

```python
import math

def main():
    max_n = 100  # Reasonable upper bound for demonstration
    found = set()
    
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        # Iterate possible a and b where a + b < n
        for a in range(1, n):
            for b in range(1, n - a + 1):
                c = n - a - b
                if c <= 0:
                    continue
                
                # Check gcd(a,b,c) = 1
                if math.gcd(math.gcd(a, b), c) != 1:
                    continue
                
                # Compute the two expressions
                ab_plus_c = a * b + c
                ac_minus_b = a * c - b
                
                if ac_minus_b <= 0:
                    continue  # gcd is defined for positive integers
                
                # Check if gcd equals n
                if math.gcd(ab_plus_c, ac_minus_b) == n:
                    if n not in found:
                        print(f"Found n = {n} with (a,b,c) = ({a},{b},{c})")
                        found.add(n)
    
    print("\nAll found n values:", sorted(found))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
