[write_program]
This problem appears to be about characterizing non-square numbers through some Diophantine equation. Since we don't know what `omnimath35_answer` is, we'll need to explore possible forms it might take. We'll look for patterns where non-square numbers can be expressed in terms of three positive integers x, y, z.

We'll try simple polynomial forms for `omnimath35_answer` and see if they satisfy the condition for small n. The program will test various forms and check if they distinguish between square and non-square numbers.

```python
def is_square(n):
    return int(n**0.5)**2 == n

def test_formula(formula_func, max_n=20):
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        found = False
        # Try small values for x, y, z
        for x in range(1, 10):
            for y in range(1, 10):
                for z in range(1, 10):
                    if formula_func(x, y, z) == n:
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if found:
                break
        
        # Check if the condition holds
        if (not is_square(n)) == found:
            print(f"n={n}: {'OK' if (not is_square(n)) == found else 'FAIL'}")
        else:
            print(f"n={n}: Formula doesn't match condition")

# Test different possible forms
print("Testing x*y + z:")
test_formula(lambda x, y, z: x*y + z)

print("\nTesting x^2 + y - z:")
test_formula(lambda x, y, z: x*x + y - z)

print("\nTesting x*y - z:")
test_formula(lambda x, y, z: x*y - z)

print("\nTesting x + y + z:")
test_formula(lambda x, y, z: x + y + z)
```
