The problem involves counting numbers from 1 to 100 that end up red after a specific painting process. Each painter k (from 1 to 50) flips the color of a number if it's divisible by k, using alternating colors (odd painters use red). We need to count how many numbers remain red after all flips.

Here's a Python program that enumerates and counts these numbers:

```python
def is_red_after_painting(n):
    """Check if number n ends red after all painter flips"""
    flip_count = 0
    for k in range(1, 51):
        if n % k == 0:
            # Painter k flips if k is odd (red)
            if k % 2 == 1:
                flip_count += 1
    # Final color is red if odd number of red flips
    return flip_count % 2 == 1

def count_red_numbers(max_n=100):
    """Count numbers from 1 to max_n that end red"""
    count = 0
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        if is_red_after_painting(n):
            print(f"Red number found: {n}")
            count += 1
    print(f"Total red numbers between 1 and {max_n}: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    count_red_numbers()
```
