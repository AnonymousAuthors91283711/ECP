[write_program]
This problem asks to find all real-valued functions f: ℝ → ℝ that satisfy the functional inequality f(x+y) + y ≤ f(f(f(x))) for all x,y ∈ ℝ. We'll write a Python program to enumerate simple function forms (like linear functions) that satisfy this condition.

The approach will be:
1. Test linear functions f(x) = ax + b
2. For each candidate, check if it satisfies the inequality for various x,y values
3. Print functions that satisfy the condition for multiple test cases

```python
def test_function(a, b):
    """Check if f(x) = a*x + b satisfies the functional inequality."""
    def f(x):
        return a * x + b
    
    # Test several (x,y) pairs
    test_cases = [
        (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1),
        (-1, 2), (2, -1), (0.5, 0.5),
        (10, -5), (-3, 4)
    ]
    
    for x, y in test_cases:
        lhs = f(x + y) + y
        rhs = f(f(f(x)))
        if lhs > rhs + 1e-9:  # Account for floating point errors
            return False
    return True

# Search for linear solutions f(x) = ax + b
print("Searching for linear solutions f(x) = a*x + b:")
found = False
for a in [0, 1, -1, 0.5, 2]:  # Test common coefficients
    for b in [0, 1, -1, 0.5]:
        if test_function(a, b):
            print(f"Found candidate: f(x) = {a}*x + {b}")
            found = True

if not found:
    print("No linear solutions found in tested range")

# Also test constant functions
print("\nTesting constant functions f(x) = c:")
for c in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    def f(x):
        return c
    # For constant functions, inequality becomes c + y ≤ c which simplifies to y ≤ 0
    # This must hold for all y ∈ ℝ, which is false unless we restrict y
    # So constant functions don't work in general
    pass
print("Constant functions don't satisfy the inequality for all y")

print("\nNote: The program only tests a limited set of functions. A complete solution requires mathematical proof.")
```
