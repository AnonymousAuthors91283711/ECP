This problem asks for the number of positive integer solutions (x, y) to the equation x² - 8x + y² + 4y = 5. We'll complete the squares to transform the equation into a more manageable form, then enumerate possible solutions.

First, complete the squares:
x² - 8x = (x-4)² - 16
y² + 4y = (y+2)² - 4
So the equation becomes (x-4)² + (y+2)² = 25

Now we need positive integer solutions (x,y) where (x-4)² + (y+2)² = 25. We'll enumerate all integer pairs (a,b) where a² + b² = 25 (possible combinations of a and b), then solve for x and y.

```python
def count_solutions():
    count = 0
    # All possible (a,b) pairs where a² + b² = 25
    radius_squared = 25
    possible_pairs = []
    
    # Generate all possible integer pairs (a,b) with a² + b² = 25
    for a in range(-5, 6):
        remaining = radius_squared - a*a
        if remaining < 0:
            continue
        b = int(remaining**0.5)
        if b*b == remaining:
            possible_pairs.append((a, b))
            if b != 0:
                possible_pairs.append((a, -b))
    
    # Remove duplicates by converting to set
    unique_pairs = list(set(possible_pairs))
    
    # Check each pair for positive integer solutions
    for a, b in unique_pairs:
        x = a + 4
        y = b - 2
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}")
            count += 1
    
    print(f"Total number of solutions: {count}")

count_solutions()
```
