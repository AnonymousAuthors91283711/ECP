This problem involves finding the average (a+b)/2 given that 2^a * 2^b = 64. We can simplify the equation using exponent rules and solve for a+b, then compute the average. The program will enumerate possible integer values for a and b that satisfy the equation, then compute their average.

```python
def main():
    # The equation simplifies to 2^(a+b) = 64, so a+b = 6 (since 2^6=64)
    # Therefore (a+b)/2 = 3 for any solution
    # We'll enumerate some integer solutions to demonstrate
    target = 64
    solutions = []
    
    # Enumerate integer solutions for demonstration
    for a in range(-10, 11):
        for b in range(-10, 11):
            if (2**a) * (2**b) == target:
                solutions.append((a, b))
                print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, average={(a+b)/2}")
    
    # All solutions will have average 3
    print("\nAll found solutions have average 3")
    print("Therefore, the answer is always 3 for any valid a,b")
