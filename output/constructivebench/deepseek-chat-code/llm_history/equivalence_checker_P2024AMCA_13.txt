Ground Truth Answer: (0, 1 / 2)
Proposed Answer: (-1/2, Real.exp 1 + Real.exp 0 - 2)
Let's analyze the problem and answers carefully:

1. The problem asks for a point (a, f(-1)) where:
   - a is the symmetry point of the function f (i.e., f(x) = f(2a - x))
   - f(-1) = 1/2
   - The point (2a - (-1), f(2a - (-1))) should match P2024AMCA_13_answer

2. Ground truth gives (0, 1/2):
   - a = 0 would satisfy f(x) = f(-x) (symmetry about 0)
   - f(-1) = exp(0) + exp(1) - 2 ≈ 1 + 2.718 - 2 ≈ 1.718 ≠ 0.5 (contradicts given condition)

3. Proposed answer gives (-1/2, ...):
   - For symmetry about a=-1/2, we'd have f(x) = f(-1 - x)
   - Checking f(-1) = exp(0) + exp(1) - 2 ≈ 1.718 ≠ 0.5 (same issue)
   - The y-value given is f(0) = exp(1) + exp(0) - 2 ≈ 1.718

The ground truth answer seems incorrect as it doesn't satisfy f(-1) = 1/2. The proposed answer is also incorrect for the same reason, and additionally provides a different point than requested.
