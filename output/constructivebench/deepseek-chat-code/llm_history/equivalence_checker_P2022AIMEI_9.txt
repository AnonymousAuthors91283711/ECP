Ground Truth Answer: (5, 247)
Proposed Answer: (1, 924)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about calculating a probability ratio (even_arrangements/total_arrangements) in reduced form.

2. First, let's compute the actual values:
   - total_arrangements = 12! / (2^6) = 7484400
   - even_arrangements = 5 * (2^5 * 6!) = 5 * (32 * 720) = 115200

3. The ratio is: 115200/7484400 = 1152/74844 = 288/18711 = 96/6237 = 32/2079

4. The simplified form is 32/2079, but neither ground truth (5/247) nor proposed (1/924) matches this.

5. The ground truth answer (5,247) gives 5/247 ≈ 0.02024 while the correct ratio is ≈ 0.01539
   The proposed answer (1,924) gives ≈ 0.00108, which is even further off.

6. Both answers are incorrect, but the ground truth is closer to the actual value.
