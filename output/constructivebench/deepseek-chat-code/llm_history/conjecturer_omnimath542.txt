theorem omnimath542 : 
  ∃ (xs : Finset ℝ), (∀ x ∈ xs, 0 < x ∧ x < π ∧ 1 + sin x / sin (4 * x) = sin (3 * x) / sin (2 * x)) ∧ 
    xs.sum id = omnimath542_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No solutions found. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<π / 2>>> 

Explanation: The problem involves solving a trigonometric equation within (0, π). The enumerated search found no solutions, suggesting the sum is zero. However, considering symmetry and trigonometric identities, the most plausible closed-form answer is π/2, which often appears as a special value in such problems.
