abbrev omnimath3557_answer : Set (ℝ → ℝ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3557 (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
  (∀ x y, f (x + y) + y ≤ f (f (f x))) ↔ f ∈ omnimath3557_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for linear solutions f(x) = a*x + b:
Found candidate: f(x) = -1*x + 0
Found candidate: f(x) = -1*x + 1
Found candidate: f(x) = -1*x + -1
Found candidate: f(x) = -1*x + 0.5

Testing constant functions f(x) = c:
Constant functions don't satisfy the inequality for all y

Note: The program only tests a limited set of functions. A complete solution requires mathematical proof.. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
Based on the enumerated answers and the functional inequality, the pattern suggests all linear functions with slope -1. The constant term can vary, but testing shows it's not strictly constrained. The solution set appears to be all affine functions with a=-1.
