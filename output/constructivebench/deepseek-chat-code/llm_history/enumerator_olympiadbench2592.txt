This problem involves finding the equivalent annual interest rate `r` that would give the same final amount after 3 years as three consecutive years of different interest rates (-2.9%, +8.9%, +6.9%). We need to solve for `r` in the equation:
(1 - 0.029)(1 + 0.089)(1 + 0.069) = (1 + r/100)^3

The Python program will calculate the exact value of `r` by solving this equation numerically.

```python
import math

def calculate_r():
    # Calculate the product of the three yearly factors
    product = (1 - 0.029) * (1 + 0.089) * (1 + 0.069)
    
    # Solve for r in (1 + r/100)^3 = product
    r = 100 * (product ** (1/3) - 1)
    
    # Print the exact value and a decimal approximation
    print(f"Exact value: {r}")
    print(f"Approximate value: {r:.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    calculate_r()
```
