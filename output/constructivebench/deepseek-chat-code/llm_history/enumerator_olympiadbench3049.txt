This problem asks for the smallest natural number `s` that can be expressed as `20x + 80y` where `x` and `y` are natural numbers (not both zero), and the average `s/(x+y) = 34`. We need to find the minimal such `s`.

The approach is to:
1. Express the condition `s/(x+y) = 34` as `s = 34(x+y)`
2. Combine with `s = 20x + 80y` to get `34x + 34y = 20x + 80y`
3. Simplify to `14x = 46y` or `7x = 23y`
4. Find minimal natural solutions (x,y) satisfying this equation
5. Compute s for these solutions and find the minimal one

```python
def find_min_s():
    min_s = None
    # We'll search for solutions where y ranges up to 100 (arbitrary large enough bound)
    for y in range(1, 101):
        # From 7x = 23y, x must be a multiple of 23
        if (23 * y) % 7 != 0:
            continue
        x = (23 * y) // 7
        s = 20 * x + 80 * y
        average = s / (x + y)
        # Verify the average condition (should be exactly 34 from our derivation)
        if average == 34:
            if min_s is None or s < min_s:
                min_s = s
                print(f"Found candidate: s={s} with x={x}, y={y}")
    if min_s is not None:
        print(f"Minimal s found: {min_s}")
    else:
        print("No solution found in the search range")

find_min_s()
```
