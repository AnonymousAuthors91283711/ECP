open Real

abbrev P2007AMCA_9_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2007AMCA_9 : 
  ∃ (d : ℝ), 4.5 * 70 = d ∧ d / 60 = P2007AMCA_9_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: 315.0 / 60. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 7, which is at "P2007AMCA_9_answer :" in "abbrev P2007AMCA_9_answer : ℝ := 315.0 / 60", there is an error: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instDivInvMonoid', and it does not have executable code.
. Enumerated Answers: d = 315.0
answer = 5.25
exact answer = 5.25. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Looking at the problem and error message, we need to provide a real number answer that satisfies both equations. The enumerated answers show d=315.0 and final answer=5.25, which is indeed 315/60.

The error occurs because Lean's Real division is noncomputable by default. We can fix this by either:
1. Using exact arithmetic (Rat) instead of floating point
2. Making the definition noncomputable
3. Using exact decimal representation

The simplest solution is to use the exact decimal representation of 5.25, which avoids division and noncomputability issues entirely.

<<<5.25>>> 

Explanation:
- The problem requires finding d such that 4.5*70 = d and d/60 is the answer
- 4.5*70 = 315
- 315/60 = 5.25
- Using exact decimal 5.25 avoids division/noncomputability issues
- This matches the enumerated exact answer of 5.25
