[write_program]
The problem appears to be asking for a sorted list of real numbers that contains exactly the elements {3, 5/2, √10}. The solution is simply to sort these three numbers and return them in a list.

Here's a Python program that computes and prints the sorted list of these numbers:

```python
import math

# The three numbers we need to sort
numbers = [3, 5/2, math.sqrt(10)]

# Sort the numbers in ascending order
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)

# Print the sorted list
print(sorted_numbers)
```

The output will be [2.5, 3, 3.1622776601683795] where:
- 2.5 is 5/2
- 3 is 3
- 3.1622776601683795 is the approximate value of √10

The program satisfies all requirements:
1. It prints the exact values (though √10 is approximated in floating point)
2. It's efficient with minimal computation
3. No input parameters are needed
4. The output is well under 400 tokens
5. It doesn't hardcode the final answer but computes it from the given numbers
