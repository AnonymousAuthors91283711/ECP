[write_program]
This problem is about finding consecutive integer ranges where every number in the range has a small prime factor. We'll write a Python program to:

1. Check if there exists no 14-number range (n to n+13) where every number has a prime factor ≤ 11
2. Check if there exists a 21-number range (n to n+20) where every number has a prime factor ≤ 13

We'll search for these ranges up to a reasonable limit (say 1 million) and print any candidate ranges found.

            return n == p
