abbrev omnimath2716_answer : ℤ → ℤ := sorry
  
theorem omnimath2716 (c : ℤ) (h : (X ^ 2 + 12 * X + C c).IsRoot 18) :
    (X ^ 2 + 12 * X + C c).IsRoot (omnimath2716_answer c) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun c => -12 - 18  -- For x² + 12x + c, sum of roots is -12, so other root is -12 - 18
Proposed Answer: fun c => -12 - 18
<<<True>>>
