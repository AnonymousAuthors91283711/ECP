[write_program]
This problem involves finding the real part of a complex number z that satisfies two distance conditions. We'll write a Python program to numerically search for possible values of z.re that satisfy both conditions.

The approach:
1. Represent z as x + yi where x is real part, y is imaginary part
2. Convert the distance conditions into equations:
   - |z - 1| = 2 → √((x-1)² + y²) = 2
   - |z² - 1| = 6 → √((x²-y²-1)² + (2xy)²) = 6
3. Search for x values that satisfy both equations (within floating point tolerance)

```python
import math
import cmath

def find_z_values():
    # Search range and step size for x (real part)
    x_start, x_end = -3.0, 3.0
    step = 0.0001
    tolerance = 1e-6
    
    x = x_start
    while x <= x_end:
        # First condition: |z-1| = 2 → y² = 4 - (x-1)²
        y_squared = 4 - (x - 1)**2
        if y_squared >= 0:  # Only consider real y
            y1 = math.sqrt(y_squared)
            y2 = -y1
            
            # Check both possible y values
            for y in [y1, y2]:
                z = complex(x, y)
                # Second condition: |z²-1| = 6
                condition2 = abs(z**2 - 1)
                if abs(condition2 - 6) < tolerance:
                    print(f"Found z.re = {x:.5f} with z.im = {y:.5f}")
        
        x += step

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_z_values()
```

The program searches through possible real parts of z and checks both possible imaginary parts that satisfy the first condition. When it finds values that also satisfy the second condition within tolerance, it prints them. The output will show candidate real parts that satisfy both conditions.
