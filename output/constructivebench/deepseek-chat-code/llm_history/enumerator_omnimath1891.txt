The problem involves summing a specific expression over all divisors of 2016. We need to enumerate the divisors of 2016, compute the sum for each divisor, and find the exact rational result.

Here's a Python program that:
1. Finds all divisors of 2016
2. Computes the sum for each divisor
3. Outputs the exact rational result by accumulating fractions

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from math import isqrt

def get_divisors(n):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, isqrt(n) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(n // i)
    return sorted(divisors)

def main():
    n = 2016
    divisors = get_divisors(n)
    k = len(divisors)
    total = Fraction(0, 1)
    
    for d in divisors:
        numerator = d * d
        denominator = d * d + n
        term = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
        total += term
    
    result = Fraction(1, k) * total
    print(f"Exact rational result: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
