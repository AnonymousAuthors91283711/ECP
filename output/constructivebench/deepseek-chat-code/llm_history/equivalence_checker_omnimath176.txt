Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1, 1)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1, 1)} ∪ (Set.range fun a => (a, a, 3 - 2 * a)) \ {(1, 1, 1)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all complex triples (x,y,z) where x+y+z=3 and x³+y³+z³=3.

2. The ground truth answer is just {(1,1,1)}, meaning this is the only solution.

3. The proposed answer includes:
   - {(1,1,1)} (the correct solution)
   - Plus all triples of the form (a,a,3-2a) except (1,1,1)

For the proposed answer to be correct, all triples (a,a,3-2a) would need to satisfy both equations (except (1,1,1)). Let's test this:

For (a,a,3-2a):
- x+y+z = a + a + (3-2a) = 3 (satisfies first equation)
- x³+y³+z³ = a³ + a³ + (3-2a)³ = 2a³ + (27 - 54a + 36a² - 8a³) = 27 - 54a + 36a² - 6a³

For this to equal 3:
27 - 54a + 36a² - 6a³ = 3
=> -6a³ + 36a² - 54a + 24 = 0
=> a³ - 6a² + 9a - 4 = 0
The only real solution is a=1 (which gives (1,1,1)), but there might be complex solutions.

However, the ground truth suggests only (1,1,1) works, implying the other complex roots don't satisfy both equations or are already accounted for in some way.

The proposed answer incorrectly includes additional solutions beyond (1,1,1).
