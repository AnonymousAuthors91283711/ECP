Ground Truth Answer: fun n k => 2^(k - n)
Proposed Answer: fun n k => choose (2 * n) k * 2^(k - n)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting certain types of functions from Fin k to Fin (2*n) with parity constraints.

2. The ground truth answer suggests that the count is 2^(k-n), which makes sense because:
   - We have k-n degrees of freedom after satisfying the constraints
   - Each can be assigned in 2 ways (binary choice)

3. The proposed answer includes an additional factor choose (2*n) k, which would represent choosing k elements from 2*n elements. This doesn't align with the problem's constraints:
   - The constraints are about parity conditions, not about selecting subsets
   - The choose factor would overcount configurations that don't satisfy the parity constraints

The proposed answer incorrectly includes a combinatorial factor that shouldn't be there. The ground truth answer correctly captures the essence of the counting problem with the given constraints.
