Ground Truth Answer: fun n => choose n 2
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n * (n - 1) / 2
<<<True>>>

Explanation: 
The ground truth answer uses the binomial coefficient "choose n 2", which is the standard formula for combinations of n items taken 2 at a time. The proposed answer "n * (n - 1) / 2" is exactly equivalent to "choose n 2" since:
choose n 2 = n! / (2! * (n-2)!) = (n * (n-1)) / 2

Both expressions calculate the number of possible pairs (2-element subsets) from a set of size n, which is what the problem is asking for. The answers are mathematically identical.
