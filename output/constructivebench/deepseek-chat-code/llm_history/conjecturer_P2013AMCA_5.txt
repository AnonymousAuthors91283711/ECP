abbrev P2013AMCA_5_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2013AMCA_5 : 
  let total := 105 + 125 + 175
  let share := total / 3
  let t := share - 105
  let d := share - 125
  t - d = P2013AMCA_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Total: 405
Equal share: 135
t = share - 105 = 30
d = share - 125 = 10
Final answer (t - d): 20
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
