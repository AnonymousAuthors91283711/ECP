[write_program]
This problem asks for the count of numbers `n` between 1 and 2005 where the product of `(4i-2)` for `i` from 1 to `n` is divisible by `n!`. We'll write a Python program to enumerate these values efficiently.

Key observations:
1. The product can be rewritten as `2^n * (2n-1)!!` where `!!` is double factorial
2. We need to check when this product is divisible by `n!`
3. We'll compute this for each `n` from 1 to 2005 and count the matches

```python
import math

def is_divisible(n):
    """Check if product(4i-2) for i=1..n is divisible by n!"""
    # Compute product numerator (4i-2) for i=1..n = 2^n * (2n-1)!!
    # We need this to be divisible by n!
    # Compute the prime factorization of both and compare exponents
    
    # Precompute primes up to 2*2005 using sieve
    max_prime = 2 * 2005
    sieve = [True] * (max_prime + 1)
    sieve[0] = sieve[1] = False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(max_prime)) + 1):
        if sieve[i]:
            sieve[i*i::i] = [False] * len(sieve[i*i::i])
    primes = [i for i, is_p in enumerate(sieve) if is_p]
