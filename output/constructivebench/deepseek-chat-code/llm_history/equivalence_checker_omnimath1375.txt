Ground Truth Answer: fun (x, y, _) => x / y
Proposed Answer: fun ⟨x, y, z⟩ => if y = 2 * x ∧ z = x + 6 then 1 / 2 else 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two equations relating x, y, z and asks for a function that returns 1/2 under these conditions.

2. The ground truth answer `fun (x, y, _) => x / y` is a general function that doesn't consider the constraints given in the problem.

3. The proposed answer `fun ⟨x, y, z⟩ => if y = 2 * x ∧ z = x + 6 then 1 / 2 else 0` actually encodes the solution to the system of equations given in the problem (the constraints h). The conditions y = 2x and z = x + 6 are indeed the solutions to the given equations.

4. However, the ground truth answer doesn't match the proposed answer in any way - they're completely different functions with different behaviors. The ground truth answer returns x/y regardless of conditions, while the proposed answer returns either 1/2 or 0 based on specific conditions.

The answers are not equivalent, so the correct response is:

<<<False>>>
