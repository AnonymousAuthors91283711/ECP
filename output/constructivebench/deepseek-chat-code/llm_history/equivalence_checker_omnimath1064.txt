Ground Truth Answer: (3^59 + 1) / (4 * 3^59)
Proposed Answer: 1 / 4 + 1 / (4 * 3^59)
Let's analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

Ground Truth: (3^59 + 1) / (4 * 3^59)
Proposed: 1/4 + 1/(4 * 3^59)

Let's simplify the proposed answer:
1/4 + 1/(4 * 3^59) = (3^59)/(4 * 3^59) + 1/(4 * 3^59) = (3^59 + 1)/(4 * 3^59)

This is exactly equal to the ground truth answer. The proposed answer is just an expanded form of the ground truth answer.
