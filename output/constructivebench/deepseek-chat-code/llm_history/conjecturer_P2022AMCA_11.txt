From the enumerated answers and verification, we can see there are two non-trivial solutions: x=25 and x=81/25 (which is 3.24). The proposed answer 9*(10/6)^2 correctly gives 25, but we need to generalize this to capture both solutions.

Looking at the pattern:
- For x=25: 9*(10/6)^2 = 25
- For x=81/25: 9*(6/10)^2 = 81/25

The general form appears to be 9*(a/b)^2 where a/b is either 10/6 or 6/10. This suggests the answer should be expressed in terms of reciprocals.

<<<9 * (10 / 6)^2 ∨ 9 * (6 / 10)^2>>>

However, since we need a single ℝ value, we should choose one of them. Based on the problem statement requiring "x = 1 ∨ x = P2022AMCA_11_answer", and since 25 is one valid solution, we'll use:

<<<25>>> 

The explanation is that both 25 and 81/25 satisfy the equation, but the problem asks for one specific answer (P2022AMCA_11_answer) that makes the equivalence true when combined with x=1. Since 25 is one such valid solution, we present it as the answer.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

From the error messages and enumerated answers, I can see that:
1. The answer needs to be of type ℝ (real number), not a proposition (Prop)
2. The enumerated solutions show two valid real number answers: 25 and 81/25 (3.24)
3. The problem statement suggests there should be a single answer (since it's an abbreviation)

Looking at the pattern:
- The solutions come in pairs (x=1 is already handled separately)
- The non-trivial solutions are 9*(10/6)^2 and 9*(6/10)^2
- The theorem suggests x=1 OR x=P2022AMCA_11_answer

Since we need a single real number answer and the problem seems symmetric, I'll choose one of the solutions as the primary answer. The larger value (25) seems more likely to be the intended answer.

<<<9 * (10 / 6)^2>>>

Explanation:
1. The error occurs because we tried to use logical OR (∨) between two real numbers
2. The correct solution should be one of the two real values shown in the enumeration
3. Both 9*(10/6)^2 (25) and 9*(6/10)^2 (81/25) satisfy the equation
4. The theorem handles the x=1 case separately, so we just need one non-trivial solution here[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

From the enumerated answers and verification, we can see there are two non-trivial solutions: x ≈ 25 and x ≈ 3.24. Looking at their exact forms, we notice they can be expressed as 9*(10/6)^2 and 9*(6/10)^2 respectively. The pattern suggests the answer involves powers of (10/6) or its reciprocal.

The error message indicates we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real number operations. The correct answer should be one of the non-trivial solutions (either 25 or 81/25), but since the problem asks for a single answer, we'll choose the larger one (25) which corresponds to 9*(10/6)^2.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2022AMCA_11_answer : ℝ := 9 * (10 / 6)^2>>>

Explanation:
1. The answer must be marked noncomputable due to real number operations
2. The form 9*(10/6)^2 matches one of the verified solutions (x=25)
3. This satisfies the equation when substituted back
4. The other solution (81/25) could also be valid but the problem expects one answer[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

From the enumerated answers and verification, we can see there are two non-trivial solutions: x ≈ 25 and x ≈ 3.24. The exact forms given are 9*(10/6)^2 = 25 and 9*(6/10)^2 = 81/25. The pattern suggests the answer involves ratios of 10/6 and 6/10 squared and multiplied by 9.

The error message indicates we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real number operations. The correct answer should include both solutions, but since the problem asks for P2022AMCA_11_answer as a single ℝ value, we'll choose the larger solution (25) which matches the pattern in the problem statement where it's compared against 1.

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2022AMCA_11_answer : ℝ := 25>>> 

Explanation: The equation has solutions at x=1, x=25, and x=81/25. The problem asks for P2022AMCA_11_answer as a single real number, and from the pattern, 25 is the more natural choice as it's the larger non-trivial solution expressed as 9*(10/6)^2. The noncomputable modifier is needed because real number operations aren't computable in Lean.
