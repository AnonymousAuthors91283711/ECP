[write_program]
I'll create a Python program to enumerate small grid sizes (m,n) and determine which can be tiled by disjoint hooks. A hook is a row plus a column minus their intersection point. The program will check all possible hook arrangements for small grids.

```python
def is_hook(points, m, n):
    """Check if a set of points forms a valid hook in m x n grid"""
    if not points:
        return False
    # Find the corner (intersection point)
    min_row = min(p[0] for p in points)
    min_col = min(p[1] for p in points)
    corner = (min_row, min_col)
    
    # Check all points are in the same row or column as corner
    for (r, c) in points:
        if r != corner[0] and c != corner[1]:
            return False
    
    # Check the hook has at least one point in row and column
    has_row = any(p[0] == corner[0] for p in points)
    has_col = any(p[1] == corner[1] for p in points)
    return has_row and has_col

def can_tile_with_hooks(m, n, used=None, remaining=None):
    """Recursively check if grid can be tiled with disjoint hooks"""
    if used is None:
        used = set()
        remaining = {(i, j) for i in range(m) for j in range(n)}
    
    if not remaining:
        return True
    
    # Try all possible hooks starting from remaining points
    for start in remaining:
        # Try horizontal then vertical
        for direction in ['row', 'col']:
            # Try all possible hook sizes
            for size_row in range(1, m - start[0] + 1):
                for size_col in range(1, n - start[1] + 1):
                    # Create hook points
                    hook = set()
                    for i in range(size_row):
                        hook.add((start[0] + i, start[1]))
                    for j in range(size_col):
                        hook.add((start[0], start[1] + j))
                    
                    # Check if valid and disjoint
                    if is_hook(hook, m, n) and hook.isdisjoint(used):
                        new_used = used.union(hook)
                        new_remaining = remaining - hook
                        if can_tile_with_hooks(m, n, new_used, new_remaining):
                            return True
    return False

def main():
    max_size = 6
    print("Checking which m√ón grids can be tiled with disjoint hooks:")
    for m in range(1, max_size + 1):
        for n in range(1, max_size + 1):
            if can_tile_with_hooks(m, n):
                print(f"({m}, {n}) can be tiled")
            else:
                print(f"({m}, {n}) cannot be tiled")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
