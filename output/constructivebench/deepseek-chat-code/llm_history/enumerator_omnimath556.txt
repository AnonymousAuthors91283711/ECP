This problem involves calculating a recursive probability function f(n) for n=3 with given probabilities p=2/3 and q=1/3. The function is defined recursively for n=0,1,2,3. We'll compute f(3) exactly using rational arithmetic to avoid floating-point approximations.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_f3():
    p = Fraction(2, 3)
    q = Fraction(1, 3)
    
    # Base cases
    f0 = Fraction(1, 1)
    f1 = p
    f2 = p * (p + q * p)
    
    # Compute f3 using the recursive definition
    f3 = p * (p * (p + q * p) + q * p * (p + q * p))
    
    # Simplify the fraction
    f3_simplified = f3
    
    print(f"f(3) = {f3_simplified}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_f3()
```
