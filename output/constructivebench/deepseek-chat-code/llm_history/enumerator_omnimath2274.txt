[write_program]
The problem asks to count all 4-digit numbers (1000 to 9999) that are divisible by 11 and where the sum of their digits is also divisible by 11. We'll write a Python program to enumerate and count these numbers.

```python
def is_divisible_by_11(n):
    return n % 11 == 0

def sum_digits(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

count = 0
for n in range(1000, 10000):
    if is_divisible_by_11(n) and is_divisible_by_11(sum_digits(n)):
        print(n)  # Stream partial results
        count += 1

print("Total count:", count)
```
