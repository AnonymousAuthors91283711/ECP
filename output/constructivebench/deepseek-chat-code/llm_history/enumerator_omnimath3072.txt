[write_program]
This problem appears to be a simple algebraic evaluation where we need to compute x*y - x given x=3 and y=4. The solution is straightforward, but since the problem mentions "enumerate possible answers" and "conjecturing", I'll create a program that demonstrates the computation process.

The program will:
1. Define the given values x=3 and y=4
2. Compute the expression x*y - x
3. Output the result

```python
# Given values from the problem statement
x = 3
y = 4

# Compute the expression x*y - x
result = x * y - x

# Output the result
print(f"For x={x} and y={y}, x*y - x = {result}")
```
