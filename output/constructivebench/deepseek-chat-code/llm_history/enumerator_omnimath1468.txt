[write_program]
This problem involves calculating a probability expression with given values p=3/5 and q=2/5. The expression is p²/(1-2pq). We'll compute this exact value in Python using fractions to maintain precision.

The program will:
1. Define p and q as exact fractions
2. Compute the denominator (1-2pq)
3. Compute the numerator (p²)
4. Calculate and print the exact rational result

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_probability():
    p = Fraction(3, 5)
    q = Fraction(2, 5)
    numerator = p ** 2
    denominator = 1 - 2 * p * q
    result = numerator / denominator
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_probability()
```
