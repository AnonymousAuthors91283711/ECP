The problem asks to find the remainder when 100! is divided by 101. This is equivalent to computing 100! mod 101. 

Wilson's Theorem states that for a prime p, (p-1)! ≡ -1 mod p. Since 101 is prime, we have 100! ≡ -1 ≡ 100 mod 101. Therefore, the answer should be 100.

Here's a Python program that verifies this by computing 100! mod 101 directly (though inefficiently for demonstration purposes):

```python
def factorial_mod(n, mod):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        result = (result * i) % mod
    return result

mod = 101
n = 100
print(f"{n}! mod {mod} = {factorial_mod(n, mod)}")
```
