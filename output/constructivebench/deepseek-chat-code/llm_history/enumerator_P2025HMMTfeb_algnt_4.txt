[write_program]
The problem asks to compute the sum of floor(2025/(j+0.5)) for j ranging from -1000 to 1000. We'll write a Python program to compute this sum exactly.

Key observations:
1. The floor function ⌊x⌋ gives the greatest integer ≤ x
2. We need to handle division carefully since j+0.5 can be negative
3. The sum is symmetric around j = -0.5, so we can optimize by only computing half

```python
def compute_sum():
    total = 0
    for j in range(-1000, 1001):  # j from -1000 to 1000 inclusive
        denominator = j + 0.5
        if denominator == 0:
            continue  # skip division by zero (j=-0.5 case)
        value = 2025 / denominator
        floored = int(value) if value >= 0 else int(value) - (value != int(value))
        total += floored
    return total

print(compute_sum())
```
