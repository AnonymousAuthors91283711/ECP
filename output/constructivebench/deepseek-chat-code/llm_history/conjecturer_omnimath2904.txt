theorem omnimath2904 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 20 < n ∧ 
  13 + (n - 20) / 4 = n / 2 ∧ 
  (n - 20) % 4 = 0} omnimath2904_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for smallest n > 20 satisfying the conditions:
Found solution: n = 32
Verification: 13 + (32-20)/4 = 16, 32/2 = 16. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<32>>>
