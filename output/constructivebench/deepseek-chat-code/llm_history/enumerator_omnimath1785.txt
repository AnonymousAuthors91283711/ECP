[write_program]
This problem involves finding natural numbers r, g, b that satisfy two conditions:
1. r + g + b = 97
2. (r(r-1) + g(g-1) + b(b-1)) * 12 = 97*96*5

We need to enumerate all possible combinations of (r,g,b) that satisfy these conditions. The program will iterate through possible values of r and g, compute b from the first equation, then check the second condition.

```python
def main():
    total = 97
    target = (97 * 96 * 5) / 12  # Simplified right-hand side of second condition
    
    # Iterate through possible r values (0 to 97)
    for r in range(0, total + 1):
        # Iterate through possible g values (0 to remaining)
        remaining = total - r
        for g in range(0, remaining + 1):
            b = total - r - g
            # Calculate left-hand side of second condition
            lhs = r*(r-1) + g*(g-1) + b*(b-1)
            if lhs == target:
                print(f"Found solution: r={r}, g={g}, b={b}")
                # Since we're told the answer is 41/97, we can stop after finding first solution
                return

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
