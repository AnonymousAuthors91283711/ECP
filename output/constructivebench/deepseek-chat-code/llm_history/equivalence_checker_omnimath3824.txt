Ground Truth Answer: fun a d n => (-1)^n * 2^(n-1) * d^n * (2 * a + n * d)
Proposed Answer: fun (a d : ℝ) (n : ℕ) => if n = 0 then a else if n = 1 then a else (-1)^n * (n - 1) * (2 * d)^(n - 1)
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: (-1)^n * 2^(n-1) * d^n * (2 * a + n * d)
2. Proposed: if n=0 then a; if n=1 then a; else (-1)^n * (n-1) * (2*d)^(n-1)

Comparison:
- For n=0:
  - Ground Truth: (-1)^0 * 2^(-1) * d^0 * (2a + 0) = 1 * 0.5 * 1 * 2a = a
  - Proposed: a
  - Match

- For n=1:
  - Ground Truth: (-1)^1 * 2^0 * d^1 * (2a + d) = -1 * 1 * d * (2a + d) = -2ad - d²
  - Proposed: a
  - Don't match

- For n=2:
  - Ground Truth: 1 * 2 * d² * (2a + 2d) = 4ad² + 4d³
  - Proposed: 1 * 1 * (2d)^1 = 2d
  - Don't match

The answers only match for n=0 but diverge for all other cases. The proposed answer is incorrect for n≥1.
