The error occurs because we're trying to use `0` as a proposition (in `∨`), but it should be a function. The enumerated answers show that the zero function and x² are solutions, and other quadratic forms reduce to these. Here's the corrected answer:

<<<{f | f = fun x => 0 ∨ f = fun x => x^2}>>>

Explanation:
1. The error was fixed by using proper function syntax (`fun x => 0`) instead of just `0`
2. The enumerated answers show that constant zero and quadratic x² are solutions
3. Other quadratic forms (like -x²) satisfy the equation but are equivalent to x² under scaling
4. The solution set contains exactly the zero function and all scalar multiples of x²
5. However, testing shows only x² itself works (not other multiples), so we keep just x² and zero

The answer captures all solutions found during enumeration while maintaining the simplest form. The functional equation's structure suggests these are likely the only solutions, though a complete proof would need to verify this.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
