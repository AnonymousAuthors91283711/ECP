This problem involves counting the number of 11x11 matrices with natural number entries between 1 and 2^10 where the row and column sums are divisible by 2^n for each n from 0 to 10 (where n corresponds to the row/column index). We'll write a Python program to enumerate smaller cases (2x2, 3x3 matrices) to identify a pattern.

The approach:
1. For small matrix sizes (n=2,3), generate all possible matrices with entries in [1,2^(n-1)]
2. Check the divisibility conditions for each matrix
3. Count valid matrices and look for patterns

```python
from itertools import product
import math

def count_valid_matrices(n):
    """Count n√ón matrices with entries in [1,2^(n-1)] satisfying the conditions"""
    size = n
    max_val = 2 ** (size - 1)
    entries = range(1, max_val + 1)
    count = 0
    
    # We'll represent matrix as list of lists (rows)
    # Generate all possible matrices
    for matrix in product(product(entries, repeat=size), repeat=size):
        valid = True
        # Check row and column conditions
        for i in range(size):
            row_sum = sum(matrix[i])
            col_sum = sum(matrix[j][i] for j in range(size))
            if row_sum % (2**i) != 0 or col_sum % (2**i) != 0:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1
    return count

# Test small cases to identify pattern
for n in [2, 3]:
    print(f"n={n}: {count_valid_matrices(n)}")
```
