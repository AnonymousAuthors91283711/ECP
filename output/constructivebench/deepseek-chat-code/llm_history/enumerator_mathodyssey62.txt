[write_program]
This problem involves counting non-increasing functions with and without fixed points. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all non-increasing functions for small values of n (starting with n=10 as in the problem), count those with and without fixed points, and compute the difference.

The approach will:
1. Generate all non-increasing functions f: {0,...,n-1} â†’ {0,...,n-1}
2. For each function, check if it has any fixed points (f(x) = x)
3. Count the number of functions with and without fixed points
4. Compute the difference between these counts

```python
from itertools import product

def count_functions(n):
    # Generate all non-increasing functions f: {0..n-1} -> {0..n-1}
    # A function is non-increasing if f(i) >= f(j) whenever i <= j
    
    # We'll represent functions as tuples where f[0] >= f[1] >= ... >= f[n-1]
    # This is equivalent to counting weak compositions of length n with sum <= n
    
    count_with_fp = 0
    count_without_fp = 0
    
    # Use stars and bars method to generate all non-increasing functions
    # The number of such functions is C(2n-1, n)
    # But we'll generate them explicitly for small n
    
    # Recursive generator of non-increasing sequences of length n with values 0..n-1
    def generate_func(current, remaining_depth, last_value):
        if remaining_depth == 0:
            yield current
        else:
            for v in range(min(last_value, n-1), -1, -1):
                yield from generate_func(current + (v,), remaining_depth - 1, v)
    
    for func in generate_func((), n, n-1):
        has_fixed_point = any(i == val for i, val in enumerate(func))
        if has_fixed_point:
            count_with_fp += 1
        else:
            count_without_fp += 1
    
    return count_with_fp - count_without_fp

# Compute for n=10 (as in the problem)
n = 10
result = count_functions(n)
print(f"For n={n}, the difference is: {result}")
```
