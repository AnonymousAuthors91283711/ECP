The problem asks to find the largest 4-digit number N (1000 ≤ N ≤ 9999) such that when any single digit is replaced with 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. We need to enumerate all candidates and find the maximum one that satisfies the condition. For each digit position (thousands, hundreds, tens, units), we'll check if modifying that digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7.

```python
def solve():
    for N in range(9999, 999, -1):  # Check from largest to smallest
        valid = True
        for i in range(4):  # Check each digit position
            digit = (N // (10 ** i)) % 10
            modified = N - digit * (10 ** i) + 1 * (10 ** i)
            if modified % 7 != 0:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            print(f"Found valid number: {N}")
            print(f"Answer (thousands digit + last 3 digits): {N//1000 + N%1000}")
            return  # Stop after finding the largest valid number

solve()
```
