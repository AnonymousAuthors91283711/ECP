Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 1, 4, 1), (2, 1, 1, 4)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1, 4, 2), (1, 4, 1, 2)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all quadruples (a, b, c, p) where:
   - a, b, c > 0
   - p is prime
   - 73*p² + 6 = 9*a² + 17*b² + 17*c²

2. Ground Truth Answer provides:
   - (2,1,4,1) and (2,1,1,4)

3. Proposed Answer provides:
   - (1,1,4,2) and (1,4,1,2)

Key differences:
- The a values are swapped (1 vs 2)
- The p values are swapped (1 vs 2)
- The ground truth has p=1 which is not prime (1 is not considered prime)
- The proposed answer has p=2 which is prime

Checking the proposed answer:
For (1,1,4,2):
73*2² + 6 = 73*4 + 6 = 298
9*1² + 17*1² + 17*4² = 9 + 17 + 272 = 298 ✓

For (1,4,1,2):
Same calculation as above due to symmetry ✓

The ground truth answer is incorrect because p=1 is not prime. The proposed answer is correct.

<<<True>>>
