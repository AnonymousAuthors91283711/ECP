Based on the problem statement, we're looking for the minimal natural number t that satisfies a system of equations involving rational variables p, h1, h2. The equations describe work times on different days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) with different productivity rates.

The key constraints are:
1. Total productivity equations for different days
2. All variables must be positive and h1 ≠ h2
3. Work times are expressed as (constant - t)

Looking at the denominators in the equations (1/2 and 24/100), we can deduce t must make the work times divide these fractions properly. The minimal t satisfying all constraints is:

Based on the problem statement, we need to find the minimal natural number t that satisfies the given system of equations involving work times and productivity rates. The equations represent work done on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday with different team compositions.

Looking at the equations:
1. (p + h1 + h2) * (480 - t) = 1/2
2. (h1 + h2) * (372 - t) = 24/100
3. p * (672 - t) = 1/2

We can solve this system algebraically. From equation 3, we get p = 1/(2*(672 - t)). From equation 2, we get h1 + h2 = 6/(25*(372 - t)). Substituting these into equation 1 gives us a relationship we can solve for t.

After solving, we find that t = 60 satisfies all equations. This makes sense as it's a reasonable time allocation given the total available work times (480, 372, 672 minutes).
