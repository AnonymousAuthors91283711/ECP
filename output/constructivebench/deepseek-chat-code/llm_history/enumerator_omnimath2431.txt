This problem involves finding the area of a specific triangle divided by 4. Given triangle ABC with sides AB=8, BC=15, AC=17, we can verify it's a right triangle (8² + 15² = 17²) and calculate its area as (8*15)/2 = 60. The problem asks for area/4, which would be 15. Since the answer is straightforward, we'll just output it.

```python
# Problem: Given right triangle ABC with sides 8,15,17 (area=60), find area/4
print(15)
```
