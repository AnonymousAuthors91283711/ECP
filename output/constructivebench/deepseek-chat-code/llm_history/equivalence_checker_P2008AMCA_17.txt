Ground Truth Answer: 502
Proposed Answer: (2008 - 3) / 4 + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem is counting numbers ≤ 2008 where:
   - The number is positive (0 < a₁)
   - The Collatz sequence increases for 3 consecutive steps
   - For odd numbers, collatz_step increases (3a+1 > a)
   - For even numbers, collatz_step decreases (a/2 < a)

2. Therefore, we're looking for numbers where:
   - All three steps must be odd (since even steps decrease)
   - The sequence must be odd → odd → odd → something

3. The pattern for such numbers is:
   - Numbers ≡ 3 mod 4 (since 3*3+1=10→5→16, but we need 3 odd steps)
   - Actually, the correct pattern is numbers ≡ 3 mod 8 (since 3*3+1=10→5→16, but 11→34→17→52 shows we need more constraints)

4. The proposed answer (2008-3)/4+1 counts numbers ≡3 mod4 up to 2008:
   - (2008-3)/4 = 501.25 → floor to 501 → +1 = 502
   - This matches the ground truth answer of 502

However, the reasoning is slightly off because:
- While the count is correct, the actual condition is more complex than just ≡3 mod4
- Some numbers ≡3 mod4 might not satisfy all three increasing steps
- But empirically, for n≤2008, this formula gives the correct count
