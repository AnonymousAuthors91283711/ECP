[write_program]
This problem asks for the largest natural number `n` such that `2^n` divides `7^2048 - 1`. We'll write a Python program to compute this by finding the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of `7^2048 - 1`.

The key mathematical insight is that for an odd prime `p`, the exponent of 2 in `p^m - 1` can be computed using the Lifting the Exponent (LTE) lemma. For `p ≡ 3 mod 4`, the exponent is `v2(p^2 - 1) + v2(m) - 1` where `v2` is the 2-adic valuation.

```python
def v2(n):
    """Compute the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of n"""
    count = 0
    while n % 2 == 0:
        n //= 2
        count += 1
    return count

# Since 7 ≡ 3 mod 4, we can use LTE lemma
p = 7
m = 2048
v2_p2_minus_1 = v2(p**2 - 1)  # v2(49 - 1) = v2(48) = 4
v2_m = v2(m)                   # v2(2048) = 11
exponent = v2_p2_minus_1 + v2_m - 1

print(f"Exponent of 2 in 7^{2048} - 1 is: {exponent}")
```
