This problem involves summing the Euler's totient-like function `phi_factorial` for numbers from 2 to 50 that are coprime with 50, then taking modulo 50. The `phi_factorial` function multiplies all numbers â‰¤n that are coprime with n. We'll write a Python program to compute this sum modulo 50.

The approach:
1. Define gcd and phi_factorial functions
2. Generate numbers from 2 to 50 coprime with 50
3. Compute phi_factorial for each and sum them
4. Take modulo 50 of the sum

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def phi_factorial(n):
    product = 1
    for k in range(1, n+1):
        if k != 0 and gcd(k, n) == 1:
            product *= k
    return product

total = 0
for n in range(2, 51):
    if gcd(n, 50) == 1:
        pf = phi_factorial(n)
        total += pf
        print(f"n={n}, phi_factorial={pf}, running_total={total}")

result = total % 50
print(f"Final result modulo 50: {result}")
```
