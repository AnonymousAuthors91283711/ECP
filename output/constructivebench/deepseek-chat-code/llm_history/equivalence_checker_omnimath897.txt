  let D := (100 : ℕ).divisors
  let Z := Finset.Icc 1 100
  (∑ d in D, ∑ z in Z, if d ∣ z then (1 : ℚ) else 0) / (D.card * Z.card) = omnimath897_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 217 / 900
Proposed Answer: 1 / 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the average number of divisors for numbers from 1 to 100. It sums up all divisor relationships (d|z) and divides by the total possible pairs (D.card * Z.card).

2. The ground truth answer is 217/900 ≈ 0.2411

3. The proposed answer is 1/4 = 0.25

Calculation:
- Total numbers: 100
- Total divisors to consider: divisors of 100 (which are 1,2,4,5,10,20,25,50,100) - 9 divisors
- However, the problem actually considers all divisors of all numbers from 1 to 100, not just divisors of 100
- The correct sum would be the total number of divisors for all numbers from 1 to 100, which is indeed 217
- Total possible pairs would be 100 numbers * 100 possible divisors = 10000, but since we're only checking actual divisors, it's more complex
- The denominator in the problem is D.card * Z.card = 9 * 100 = 900 (which matches the ground truth)

The proposed answer 1/4 is incorrect as it doesn't match the precise calculation. The correct average is 217/900.
