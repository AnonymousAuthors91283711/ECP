Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the enumerated answers, we see they are all numbers coprime with 2, 3, 5, 7 (the primes in the list). The smallest such number is 1, which satisfies the first condition trivially. For the second condition, we need a number where at least one of the given primes divides one of the expressions involving powers of 2 and 3. The simplest solution is 1, as it's the minimal natural number satisfying the first condition.
