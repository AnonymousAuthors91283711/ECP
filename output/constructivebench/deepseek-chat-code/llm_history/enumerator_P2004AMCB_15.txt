This problem involves finding two-digit numbers j and b (both less than 100) that satisfy several conditions:
1. The tens digit of j equals the units digit of b
2. The units digit of j equals the tens digit of b
3. j + 5 equals twice (b + 5)
4. The absolute difference between j and b should be determined

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible pairs (j, b) that satisfy these conditions, then compute their absolute differences.

```python
def solve():
    for j in range(10, 100):  # Two-digit numbers
        j_tens = j // 10
        j_units = j % 10
        
        for b in range(10, 100):
            b_tens = b // 10
            b_units = b % 10
            
            # Check digit conditions
            if j_tens != b_units or j_units != b_tens:
                continue
            
            # Check equation condition
            if j + 5 == 2 * (b + 5):
                diff = abs(j - b)
                print(f"Found pair: j={j}, b={b}, |j-b|={diff}")
                return  # Since we only need one solution per problem statement

solve()
```
