This problem involves calculating a double sum of probabilities where the condition is that the sum of two numbers (a and b) equals either 12 or 20. The probabilities p(n) are defined as 1/32 for n from 1 to 16 and 1/2 for n=17.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Define the probability function p(n)
2. Iterate through all pairs (a,b) in 1..17
3. Check if a+b equals 12 or 20
4. Sum the products p(a)*p(b) for valid pairs

```python
def p(n):
    if n == 17:
        return 1/2
    elif 1 <= n <= 16:
        return 1/32
    else:
        return 0

total = 0.0

# Iterate through all pairs (a,b) where 1 ≤ a,b ≤ 17
for a in range(1, 18):
    for b in range(1, 18):
        if (a + b == 12) or (a + b == 20):
            product = p(a) * p(b)
            total += product
            # Print each valid pair and its contribution
            print(f"Pair ({a},{b}): {product}")

# Print the final total
print("\nFinal sum:", total)
```
