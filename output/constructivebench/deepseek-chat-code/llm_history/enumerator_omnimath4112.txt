[write_program]
This problem asks to find all real-valued functions f: ℝ → ℝ that satisfy the functional equation:
f(x²) + f(2y²) = (f(x+y) + f(y)) * (f(x-y) + f(y)) for all x,y ∈ ℝ.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible solutions by testing common function forms (constant, linear, quadratic) and checking if they satisfy the equation.

```python
import sympy as sp

def check_solution(f_expr):
    """Check if the given function expression satisfies the functional equation."""
    x, y = sp.symbols('x y')
    f = sp.Lambda(x, f_expr)
    
    # Original equation: f(x²) + f(2y²) = (f(x+y) + f(y)) * (f(x-y) + f(y))
    lhs = f(x**2) + f(2*y**2)
    rhs = (f(x + y) + f(y)) * (f(x - y) + f(y))
    
    # Simplify the difference between both sides
    diff = sp.simplify(lhs - rhs)
    return diff == 0

def enumerate_solutions():
    """Enumerate possible solutions by testing common function forms."""
    x = sp.symbols('x')
    
    # Test constant functions f(x) = c
    c = sp.Symbol('c')
    if check_solution(c):
        print(f"Constant solution: f(x) = {c}")
    
    # Test linear functions f(x) = a*x + b
    a, b = sp.symbols('a b')
    linear = a*x + b
    if check_solution(linear):
        print(f"Linear solution: f(x) = {linear}")
    
    # Test quadratic functions f(x) = a*x² + b*x + c
    quadratic = a*x**2 + b*x + c
    if check_solution(quadratic):
        print(f"Quadratic solution: f(x) = {quadratic}")
    
    # Special case: f(x) = x²
    if check_solution(x**2):
        print("Special solution: f(x) = x²")
    
    # Special case: f(x) = 0
    if check_solution(0):
        print("Special solution: f(x) = 0")
    
    # Special case: f(x) = 1
    if check_solution(1):
        print("Special solution: f(x) = 1")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_solutions()
```

The program tests various function forms symbolically using sympy. It checks constant, linear, and quadratic functions, as well as some specific cases (x², 0, 1). The output will show which of these forms satisfy the given functional equation. The program doesn't attempt to find all possible solutions, but rather checks common candidates that might satisfy the equation.
