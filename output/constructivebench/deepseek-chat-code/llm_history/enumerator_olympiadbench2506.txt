This problem involves a recurrence relation with rational numbers. We need to find the initial value a₀ given that a₂ = 41/29 and the recurrence relation aₙ₊₁ = 1 + 1/(1 + aₙ) for n = 0,1,2.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Work backwards from a₂ to find a₁
2. Then work backwards from a₁ to find a₀
3. Print each intermediate value

The program will use exact fractions via the fractions module to avoid floating-point inaccuracies.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve():
    # Given values
    a2 = Fraction(41, 29)
    
    # Work backwards to find a1
    # a2 = 1 + 1/(1 + a1) => a1 = (1/(a2 - 1)) - 1
    a1 = (1 / (a2 - 1)) - 1
    
    # Work backwards to find a0
    # a1 = 1 + 1/(1 + a0) => a0 = (1/(a1 - 1)) - 1
    a0 = (1 / (a1 - 1)) - 1
    
    # Print intermediate and final results
    print(f"a₂ = {a2}")
    print(f"a₁ = {a1}")
    print(f"a₀ = {a0}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```
