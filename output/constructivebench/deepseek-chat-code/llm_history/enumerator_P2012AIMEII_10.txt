[write_program]
This problem asks for the count of integers n between 1 and 999 (inclusive) that can be expressed as n = x * floor(x) where x is a positive real number. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such numbers efficiently.

The key observation is that for each integer k (floor(x)), the possible values of x lie in [k, k+1), and n must satisfy k^2 â‰¤ n < k(k+1). We'll iterate through possible k values and generate all valid n in this range.

```python
def enumerate_special_numbers():
    max_n = 999
    special_numbers = set()
    
    # The maximum possible k is when k^2 <= 999 => k <= 31
    for k in range(1, 32):
        # n must satisfy k^2 <= n < k(k+1) and n <= 999
        lower = k * k
        upper = min(k * (k + 1) - 1, max_n)
        for n in range(lower, upper + 1):
            special_numbers.add(n)
    
    # Sort and print all found numbers
    sorted_numbers = sorted(special_numbers)
    for num in sorted_numbers:
        print(num)
    
    # Print the count
    print(f"Total count: {len(sorted_numbers)}")

enumerate_special_numbers()
```
