Ground Truth Answer: fun n t => (n + t - 1) / t
Proposed Answer: fun n t => max (n - t + 1) 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of teams that can be selected such that each team has a unique representative color (no two teams share the same representative color).

2. The ground truth answer `(n + t - 1) / t` suggests that we can have at least this many teams with distinct representative colors. This makes sense because:
   - We have n colors
   - Each team can block at most t colors (since |team| ≤ t)
   - The worst case is when teams block as many new colors as possible

3. The proposed answer `max (n - t + 1) 0` is different:
   - For n=5, t=2:
     - Ground truth: (5+2-1)/2 = 3
     - Proposed: max(5-2+1,0) = 4
   - For n=3, t=5:
     - Ground truth: (3+5-1)/5 = 1.4 → 1 (integer division)
     - Proposed: max(3-5+1,0) = 0

The answers give different results in multiple cases, and the proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth.
