This problem involves counting permutations of 6 elements where no three consecutive elements in the permutation (when considered as positions 0-5) sum to a multiple of 3. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all valid permutations of 6 elements and count those satisfying the condition.

The approach:
1. Generate all permutations of [0,1,2,3,4,5] (representing Fin 6)
2. For each permutation, check that no three consecutive elements sum to 0 mod 3
3. Count the valid permutations

```python
from itertools import permutations

def is_valid(p):
    for i in range(len(p)-2):
        if (p[i] + p[i+1] + p[i+2]) % 3 == 0:
            return False
    return True

n = 6
count = 0
for perm in permutations(range(n)):
    if is_valid(perm):
        count += 1
        print(perm)  # Print each valid permutation found

print(f"Total valid permutations: {count}")
```
