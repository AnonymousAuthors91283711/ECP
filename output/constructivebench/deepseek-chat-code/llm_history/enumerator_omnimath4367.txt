[write_program]
This problem asks for which natural numbers N every residue modulo N can be represented as a sum of squares. We'll write a Python program to test small values of N and observe patterns.

The approach:
1. For each N from 1 upwards, we'll test whether every residue 0 â‰¤ k < N can be represented as a sum of squares modulo N
2. For each k, we'll compute partial sums of squares until we either find a match or reach a reasonable limit
3. We'll print N values that satisfy the condition

```python
def is_representative(N):
    """Check if all residues mod N can be represented as sum of squares"""
    found = set()
    sum_sq = 0
    # We'll check up to N^2 terms since the sequence becomes periodic mod N
    for n in range(1, N*N + 1):
        sum_sq = (sum_sq + n*n) % N
        found.add(sum_sq)
        if len(found) == N:
            return True
    return False

def main():
    max_N = 20  # Reasonable limit for demonstration
    print("Values of N where all residues are sums of squares:")
    for N in range(1, max_N + 1):
        if is_representative(N):
            print(N)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
