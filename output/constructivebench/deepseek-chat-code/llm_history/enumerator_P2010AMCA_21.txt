This problem involves finding the maximum of three distinct real roots x₁, x₂, x₃ where a polynomial equals a linear function, and is greater than the linear function elsewhere. We'll approach this by:

1. Modeling the condition as f(x) = p(x) - (bx + c) having three distinct roots where it touches zero
2. The polynomial p(x) = x⁶ - 10x⁵ + 29x⁴ - 4x³ + ax²
3. For f(x) to have triple roots, its derivative must share these roots
4. We'll find parameters a, b, c that make this happen and identify the largest root

    # The original polynomial p(x) = x^6 - 10x^5 + 29x^4 - 4x^3 + a x^2
    # We need f(x) = p(x) - (b x + c) to have three double roots (since f > 0 elsewhere)
    # So f(x) = (x - r1)^2 (x - r2)^2 (x - r3)^2 Q(x) where Q(x) > 0
    # For simplicity, assume Q(x) = 1 (minimal case)
