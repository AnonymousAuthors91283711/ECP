The problem involves finding the difference f(12) - f(2) for a linear function f(x) = m*x + b, given that f(6) - f(2) = 12. We'll enumerate possible integer values for m and b to find patterns.

```python
def main():
    # We'll test integer values for m and b within a reasonable range
    for m in range(-10, 11):
        for b in range(-10, 11):
            # Calculate f(6) - f(2) = 4m (since (6m+b)-(2m+b)=4m)
            if 4 * m == 12:  # Given condition
                # Calculate f(12) - f(2) = 10m
                diff = 10 * m
                print(f"Found solution: m={m}, b={b}, f(12)-f(2)={diff}")
    
    # After enumerating, we observe the pattern:
    print("\nFrom enumeration, we conclude f(12)-f(2) is always 30 when the condition holds")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
