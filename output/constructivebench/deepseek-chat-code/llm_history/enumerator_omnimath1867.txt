[write_program]
This problem involves calculating the ratio of numbers coprime to 2015 in the range [1,2016] to the total numbers in that range. We'll write a Python program to compute this ratio exactly.

The approach:
1. Factorize 2015 to get its prime factors (5, 13, 31)
2. Use inclusion-exclusion principle to count numbers coprime to 2015
3. Compute the exact ratio as a fraction

```python
from math import gcd
from fractions import Fraction

def count_coprimes(n, m):
    """Count numbers <= n coprime to m using inclusion-exclusion"""
    def _count_coprimes_recursive(remaining_factors, index, current_product, count_parity):
        if index == len(remaining_factors):
            if current_product == 1:
                return 0
            return count_parity * (n // current_product)
        return (_count_coprimes_recursive(remaining_factors, index+1, current_product, count_parity) +
                _count_coprimes_recursive(remaining_factors, index+1, current_product*remaining_factors[index], -count_parity))
    
    # Get unique prime factors of m
    factors = set()
    d = 2
    temp = m
    while d*d <= temp:
        if temp % d == 0:
            factors.add(d)
            while temp % d == 0:
                temp //= d
        d += 1
    if temp > 1:
        factors.add(temp)
    
    factors = sorted(factors)
    total = n - _count_coprimes_recursive(factors, 0, 1, -1)
    return total

def main():
    m = 2015
    n = 2016
    coprimes = count_coprimes(n, m)
    ratio = Fraction(coprimes, n)
    print(f"Ratio: {ratio} (exact value: {ratio.numerator}/{ratio.denominator})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
