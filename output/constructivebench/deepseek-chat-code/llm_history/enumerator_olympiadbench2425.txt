This problem asks for the set of real numbers `s` such that there exists a real number θ where `cos θ = tan θ` and `sin θ = s`. To enumerate possible solutions, we can:

1. Find θ values where cos θ = tan θ (which implies cos² θ = sin θ)
2. Compute sin θ for those θ values
3. Collect unique sin θ values

We'll use numerical methods to approximate solutions since exact solutions may be difficult. We'll search in the range [-2π, 2π] since trigonometric functions are periodic.

```python
import math

def find_solutions():
    solutions = set()
    # Search in [-2π, 2π] with small steps
    for i in range(-4000, 4001):
        theta = i * math.pi / 1000  # step size of π/1000
        try:
            lhs = math.cos(theta)
            rhs = math.tan(theta)
            # Check if cos(θ) ≈ tan(θ) within tolerance
            if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-8:
                s = math.sin(theta)
                # Round to 6 decimal places to avoid floating point errors
                rounded_s = round(s, 6)
                if rounded_s not in solutions:
                    solutions.add(rounded_s)
                    print(rounded_s)
        except:
            # Skip points where tan is undefined (θ = π/2 + kπ)
            continue
    
    print("Possible s values:", sorted(solutions))

find_solutions()
```
