[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of equations with real numbers. We'll write a Python program to solve for a, b, c given the constraints and compute |a - b|. The program will:

1. Express all variables in terms of c using the given equations
2. Substitute into the sum equation to solve for c
3. Compute a and b from c
4. Calculate |a - b|

```python
def solve_problem():
    # From h1: a = 6c
    # From h2: c = b - 40 => b = c + 40
    # Substitute into hsum: 6c + (c + 40) + c = 96
    # Simplify: 8c + 40 = 96 => 8c = 56 => c = 7
    
    c = 7.0
    a = 6 * c
    b = c + 40
    result = abs(a - b)
    
    print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}, c = {c}")
    print(f"|a - b| = {result}")
