This problem involves counting bijective functions (permutations) on a 9-element set with certain constraints related to 3×3 grids. The constraints require that for each row and column in the grid interpretation, the sum of (value + 1) for the three positions must be odd.

We'll approach this by:
1. Enumerating all permutations of 9 elements (9! = 362880 possibilities)
2. Checking which permutations satisfy the row and column constraints when arranged in a 3×3 grid
3. Counting the valid permutations and computing the probability

Since enumerating all 9! permutations is computationally intensive, we'll optimize by:
- Using itertools.permutations for permutation generation
- Early termination when constraints fail
- Representing the grid as a flattened list

```python
import itertools
from math import factorial

def is_valid(p):
    # Check row constraints
    for i in range(3):
        row_sum = sum(p[3*i + k] + 1 for k in range(3))
        if row_sum % 2 == 0:
            return False
    # Check column constraints
    for j in range(3):
        col_sum = sum(p[3*k + j] + 1 for k in range(3))
        if col_sum % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True

def enumerate_valid_permutations():
    count = 0
    total = factorial(9)
    processed = 0
    batch_size = 10000  # Print progress periodically
    
    for perm in itertools.permutations(range(9)):
        processed += 1
        if processed % batch_size == 0:
            print(f"Processed {processed}/{total} permutations")
        if is_valid(perm):
            count += 1
            print(f"Found valid permutation #{count}: {perm}")
    
    probability = count / total
    print(f"Total valid permutations: {count}")
    print(f"Probability: {probability} ({count}/{total})")

enumerate_valid_permutations()
```
