Number of valid pairs: 11


. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the problem statement and the enumerated pattern (11 pairs when max_val=20), we can observe that the count corresponds to the number of prime powers in the given quadratic form. The key insight is that the equation 3x² + 10xy + 3y² factors as (3x + y)(x + 3y), which must equal a prime power p^k. The solution counts pairs where both factors are powers of the same prime.
