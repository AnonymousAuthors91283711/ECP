theorem omnimath2988 (x : ℝ) :
  x / 90 - x / 120 = 16 / 60 ↔ x = omnimath2988_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 96
Proposed Answer: 384
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem gives us the equation:
x/90 - x/120 = 16/60

Let's solve it step by step:

1. Find common denominator for left side (90 and 120):
   The least common multiple of 90 and 120 is 360.

2. Rewrite equation:
   (4x)/360 - (3x)/360 = 16/60
   (4x - 3x)/360 = 16/60
   x/360 = 16/60

3. Solve for x:
   x = (16/60)*360
   x = (16*6) = 96

The ground truth answer is 96, while the proposed answer is 384. These are clearly different values.
