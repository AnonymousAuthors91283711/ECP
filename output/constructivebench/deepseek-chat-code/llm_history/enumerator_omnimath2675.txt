The problem is to find the real number \( x \) such that \( x + \sqrt{81} = 25 \). Since \( \sqrt{81} = 9 \), the equation simplifies to \( x + 9 = 25 \), which gives \( x = 16 \). 

Here's a Python program that verifies this solution by checking the equation for \( x = 16 \):

```python
import math

# Check the equation x + sqrt(81) = 25 for x = 16
x = 16
result = x + math.sqrt(81)
print(f"For x = {x}, x + sqrt(81) = {result} (should be 25)")
```

The output will confirm that \( x = 16 \) satisfies the equation. The program is simple and efficient, directly computing the result without any unnecessary computations.
