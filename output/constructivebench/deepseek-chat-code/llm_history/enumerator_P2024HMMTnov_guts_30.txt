This problem asks for the number of 4-element subsets of a 4×4 grid where any two distinct points are at least distance 2 apart in either x or y coordinate (Chebyshev distance). We'll enumerate all possible subsets that satisfy this condition.

The approach is:
1. Generate all possible 4-point combinations from the 4×4 grid
2. For each combination, check if all pairs satisfy the distance condition
3. Count the valid combinations

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_valid(subset):
    for p in subset:
        for q in subset:
            if p == q:
                continue
            dx = abs(p[0] - q[0])
            dy = abs(p[1] - q[1])
            if dx <= 1 and dy <= 1:
                return False
    return True

def enumerate_solutions():
    grid = [(i,j) for i in range(4) for j in range(4)]
    count = 0
    for subset in combinations(grid, 4):
        if is_valid(subset):
            count += 1
            print(subset)  # Print each valid subset found
    print(f"Total valid subsets: {count}")

enumerate_solutions()
```
