[write_program]
The problem asks to compute the sum of 2^(2*y) for pairs (x,y) in [(1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1)]. We'll write a Python program to calculate this sum exactly.

```python
# Calculate the sum of 2^(2*y) for given pairs (x,y)
pairs = [(1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1)]
total = 0

for x, y in pairs:
    term = 2 ** (2 * y)
    print(f"For pair ({x},{y}): 2^(2*{y}) = {term}")
    total += term

print(f"Total sum: {total}")
```
