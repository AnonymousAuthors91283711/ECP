[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of positive real pairs (a,b) that satisfy the equation (1+2a)(1+b)(2a+b) = 16ab. We'll write a Python program to numerically search for solutions by iterating through possible values of a and b.

The approach:
1. Sample a range of positive a values (0.1 to 5 with small steps)
2. For each a, solve for b numerically using the equation
3. Check if the solution is positive and satisfies the equation within tolerance
4. Count distinct solutions (accounting for numerical precision)

```python
import numpy as np

def find_solutions():
    solutions = set()
    # Sample a range of a values
    for a in np.linspace(0.1, 5.0, 10000):
        # Coefficients of quadratic in b: (1+2a)(2a)b + (1+2a)(1)b + (1+2a)(2a)1 - 16ab = 0
        A = (1 + 2*a) * 2*a - 16*a
        B = (1 + 2*a) * (1 + 2*a)
        C = (1 + 2*a) * 1
        
        # Solve quadratic: A*b^2 + B*b + C = 0
        discriminant = B**2 - 4*A*C
        if discriminant < 0:
            continue
        
        sqrt_disc = np.sqrt(discriminant)
        for sign in [-1, 1]:
            b = (-B + sign * sqrt_disc) / (2*A)
            if b > 1e-8:  # positive solution
                # Verify the solution satisfies original equation within tolerance
                lhs = (1 + 2*a) * (1 + b) * (2*a + b)
                rhs = 16 * a * b
                if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-6:
                    # Round to 6 decimal places to handle numerical precision
                    rounded = (round(a,6), round(b,6))
                    solutions.add(rounded)
    
    print("Found solutions:")
    for sol in sorted(solutions):
        print(sol)
    print(f"Total distinct solutions: {len(solutions)}")

find_solutions()
