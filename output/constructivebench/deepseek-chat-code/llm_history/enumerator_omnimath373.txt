This problem involves finding the value of a polynomial expression given that x satisfies x³ + x² + x + 1 = 0. We'll enumerate the roots of the given cubic equation and evaluate the target polynomial for each root.

The approach is:
1. Find all complex roots of x³ + x² + x + 1 = 0
2. For each root, evaluate x⁴ + 2x³ + 2x² + 2x + 1
3. Print each evaluation result

We'll use Python's complex number support and the roots of unity to find the solutions.

```python
import cmath

# Find roots of x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0
roots = []
# The equation can be written as (x^4 - 1)/(x - 1) = 0 for x ≠ 1, so roots are non-trivial 4th roots of unity
for k in range(1, 4):
    root = cmath.exp(2j * cmath.pi * k / 4)
    roots.append(root)

# Evaluate the polynomial for each root
for x in roots:
    result = x**4 + 2*x**3 + 2*x**2 + 2*x + 1
    print(f"For root {x}:")
    print(f"  x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 = {result}")
    print(f"  Simplified form: {result:.0f}")  # Shows the result simplifies to an integer
```
