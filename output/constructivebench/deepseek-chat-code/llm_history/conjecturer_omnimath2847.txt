Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
From the enumerated answers, we observe that the ratio (B-A)/(D-C) is consistently 1/2 across all cases. The specific values of A,B,C,D don't affect this ratio as long as they satisfy the given conditions h₁, h₂, h₃. Therefore, the solution is simply the constant rational number 1/2.
