Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => a + b
Proposed Answer: fun a b => 2021 - 44 * a
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find the minimal value of a + b where a and b are positive integers satisfying 45a + b = 2021.

2. From the equation 45a + b = 2021, we can express b = 2021 - 45a.

3. The sum a + b can then be written as a + (2021 - 45a) = 2021 - 44a.

4. The ground truth answer gives a + b directly, while the proposed answer gives 2021 - 44a, which is exactly the simplified form of a + b as shown above.

5. Both expressions are mathematically equivalent given the constraint 45a + b = 2021.

6. The proposed answer correctly captures the relationship between a and b through the given equation.

Therefore, the answers are equivalent.
