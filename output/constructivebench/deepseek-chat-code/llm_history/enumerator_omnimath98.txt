[write_program]
This problem involves finding pairs of natural numbers (k, l) where k < l and f(k) + f(l) = 293, given a specific recursive function f with certain properties. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of f(n) and find such pairs.

The approach is:
1. Compute f(n) recursively using the given conditions
2. Store computed values to avoid redundant calculations
3. Search for pairs (k,l) where k < l and f(k)+f(l)=293
4. Output valid pairs as they are found
