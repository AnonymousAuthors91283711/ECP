[write_program]
This problem involves summing an infinite series where each term is of the form 2^(2^n)/(4^(2^n)-1). To understand the behavior of this series, we'll write a Python program to compute partial sums and observe their convergence.

The program will:
1. Compute terms of the series until they become negligible (below a threshold)
2. Print each partial sum to observe convergence
3. Avoid floating-point inaccuracies by using exact fractions when possible

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_series(threshold=1e-10):
    total = Fraction(0)
    n = 0
    while True:
        # Compute numerator and denominator exactly using Fraction
        numerator = 2 ** (2 ** n)
        denominator = 4 ** (2 ** n) - 1
        
        term = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
        total += term
        
        # Print partial sum as exact fraction and decimal approximation
        print(f"S_{n} = {total} â‰ˆ {float(total):.15f}")
        
        # Check if term is small enough to stop
        if float(term) < threshold:
            break
            
        n += 1

    print("\nFinal partial sum approximation:", float(total))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_series()
```

The program uses Python's `Fraction` class to maintain exact arithmetic for as long as possible, only converting to floating-point for display and termination checks. The series converges rapidly, so we'll see the partial sums stabilize after just a few terms. The exact fractional representation helps avoid floating-point accumulation errors in early terms.
