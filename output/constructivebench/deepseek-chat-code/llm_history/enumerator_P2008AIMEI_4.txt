This problem is about finding a unique pair of positive integers (x, y) that satisfies the equation x² + 84x + 2008 = y², with some additional condition involving P2008AIMEI_4_answer. Since we don't know what P2008AIMEI_4_answer does, we'll focus on finding all (x, y) pairs that satisfy the given equation.

The approach is to:
1. Rewrite the equation as y² = (x + 42)² - 42² + 2008
2. Complete the square to get y² = (x + 42)² + 244
3. Let k = x + 42, then y² - k² = 244 → (y - k)(y + k) = 244
4. Find all factor pairs of 244 and solve for y and k
5. Then recover x from k and verify x > 0

```python
def find_xy_pairs():
    # Factor pairs of 244: (1,244), (2,122), (4,61)
    # We consider both (a,b) and (b,a) since y > k > 0
    factor_pairs = [(1, 244), (2, 122), (4, 61)]
    
    for a, b in factor_pairs:
        # Solve y - k = a, y + k = b
        y = (a + b) // 2
        k = (b - a) // 2
        if (a + b) % 2 != 0 or (b - a) % 2 != 0:
            continue  # y and k must be integers
        x = k - 42
        if x > 0:
            print(f"Found pair: x={x}, y={y}")

find_xy_pairs()
