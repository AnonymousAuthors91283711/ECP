<<<2 * 3^8>>> 

Explanation: The condition requires S to be closed under doubling modulo 16. This forms a vector space over 𝔽₂ where the basis corresponds to odd numbers in Fin 16. There are 8 odd numbers, giving 3^8 subsets for each odd generator (include it, its double, or both). The factor 2 accounts for including/excluding 0.
