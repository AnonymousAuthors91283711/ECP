Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n * (n + 1) / 2
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n * (n + 1) / 2 + n
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the maximum dimension of a subspace of n×n complex matrices where all matrices in the subspace are normal (A*Aᵀ = Aᵀ*A).

2. The ground truth answer gives the formula n(n+1)/2, which is the dimension of the space of symmetric matrices (a well-known result in linear algebra).

3. The proposed answer adds an extra "+n" term, making it n(n+1)/2 + n.

4. The space of symmetric matrices already achieves the maximum dimension for normal matrices, so adding "+n" would make it incorrect.

The proposed answer is incorrect because it overcounts the dimension. The correct maximum dimension is indeed n(n+1)/2.
