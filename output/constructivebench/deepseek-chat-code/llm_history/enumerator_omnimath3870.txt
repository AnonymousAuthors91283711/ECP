This problem is about finding the smallest number `n` such that any subset of size `n` from the numbers 1 to 2004 contains two distinct numbers whose squares are congruent modulo 2004 (i.e., 2004 divides their difference of squares).

We'll approach this by:
1. Factorizing 2004 = 4 × 3 × 167
2. Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we need squares to match in all three moduli
3. For each modulus, calculate how many distinct quadratic residues exist
4. The worst case would be taking one number from each residue class before being forced to repeat
5. Apply the Pigeonhole Principle to find the minimal n

Here's a Python program to enumerate possible answers by checking the number of quadratic residues for each prime factor:

```python
def count_quadratic_residues(p):
    """Count distinct quadratic residues modulo a prime p"""
    residues = set()
    for x in range(1, p):
        residues.add((x * x) % p)
    return len(residues) + 1  # +1 for 0

# Factorize 2004 = 4 × 3 × 167
residues_4 = 2  # {0,1} mod 4
residues_3 = count_quadratic_residues(3)  # 3
residues_167 = count_quadratic_residues(167)  # 84 (since (167+1)/2)

# By Chinese Remainder Theorem, total distinct combinations
total_residues = residues_4 * residues_3 * residues_167

# Minimal n is one more than total distinct residues (Pigeonhole Principle)
minimal_n = total_residues + 1

print(f"Quadratic residues mod 4: {residues_4}")
print(f"Quadratic residues mod 3: {residues_3}")
print(f"Quadratic residues mod 167: {residues_167}")
print(f"Total distinct residue combinations: {total_residues}")
print(f"Minimal n required: {minimal_n}")
```
