[conjecture_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

open Function Nat

abbrev olympiadbench2084_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2084 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ x y, x < f y + f (y + f x - 1) ∧ f y < x + f (y + f x - 1) ∧ f (y + f x - 1) < x + f y) ↔ f = olympiadbench2084_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing linear functions:
Found candidate: f(n) = 1n + 0

Testing constant functions:
Found constant candidate: f(n) = 3
Found constant candidate: f(n) = 4

Note: The function likely needs to be tested with higher max_test values
and more complex function forms for conclusive results.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Based on the enumerated answers and the problem constraints, the simplest consistent solution appears to be the constant function 3. The problem's inequalities suggest a balancing condition that a constant function could satisfy, and 3 was one of the found candidates.
