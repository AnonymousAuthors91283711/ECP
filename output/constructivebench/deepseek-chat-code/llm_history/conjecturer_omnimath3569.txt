abbrev omnimath3569_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3569 (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
    (f 0 + 1 = f 1 ∧ ∀ x y, f (x * y - x) + f (x + f y) = y * f x + 3) ↔ f = omnimath3569_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching linear solutions f(x) = ax + b:
Found candidate: f(x) = 1x + 1

Searching quadratic solutions f(x) = ax² + bx + c:
No quadratic solutions found. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
<<<fun x : ℝ => x + 1>>>
