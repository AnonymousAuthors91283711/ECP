[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer `n` such that for all integers `k` from 0 to 72, the fraction `(k+19)/(n+k+21)` is irreducible. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal `n` by checking each candidate `n` in order and verifying the irreducibility condition for all `k` in the range.

The approach:
1. Iterate `n` starting from 1 upwards
2. For each `n`, check all `k` from 0 to 72
3. For each `(k+19, n+k+21)` pair, check if gcd is 1
4. The first `n` that satisfies all conditions is our answer

```python
import math

def find_min_n():
    n = 1
    while True:
        all_irreducible = True
        for k in range(73):
            numerator = k + 19
            denominator = n + k + 21
            if math.gcd(numerator, denominator) != 1:
                all_irreducible = False
                break
        if all_irreducible:
            print(f"Found candidate: {n}")
            return n
        n += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = find_min_n()
    print(f"Minimal n: {result}")
```
