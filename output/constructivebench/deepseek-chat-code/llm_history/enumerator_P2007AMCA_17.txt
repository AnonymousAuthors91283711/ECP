This problem involves trigonometric identities and solving for cos(a-b) given two equations. We'll write a Python program to numerically explore possible values of a and b that satisfy the given equations, then compute cos(a-b) to conjecture the answer.

The approach:
1. Sample possible values of a and b in a reasonable range
2. For each pair, check if they approximately satisfy both equations
3. For valid pairs, compute cos(a-b)
4. Observe the pattern in the results

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def main():
    # We'll sample angles between -2π and 2π in small increments
    step = 0.01
    target_sin = math.sqrt(5/3)
    target_cos = 1.0
    tolerance = 1e-4
    
    # We'll store found pairs and their cos(a-b) values
    results = []
    
    # Iterate through possible a and b values
    for a in np.arange(-2*math.pi, 2*math.pi, step):
        for b in np.arange(-2*math.pi, 2*math.pi, step):
            sin_sum = math.sin(a) + math.sin(b)
            cos_sum = math.cos(a) + math.cos(b)
            
            # Check if equations are satisfied within tolerance
            if (abs(sin_sum - target_sin) < tolerance and abs(cos_sum - target_cos) < tolerance:
                cos_diff = math.cos(a - b)
                results.append((a, b, cos_diff))
                print(f"a={a:.3f}, b={b:.3f}, cos(a-b)={cos_diff:.5f}")
    
    # After enumeration, print all unique cos(a-b) values found
    unique_cos = sorted({round(r[2], 5) for r in results})
    print("\nUnique cos(a-b) values found:", unique_cos)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Judgement:
The original program has several issues:
1. It uses numpy unnecessarily when math module is sufficient
2. The tolerance check has a syntax error (missing closing parenthesis)
3. The step size is too large to find solutions within the given tolerance
4. It doesn't properly handle floating-point precision issues
5. The problem requires exact values, but the program only finds approximations

The program is rejected because:
1. It fails to find any solutions (empty output)
2. It doesn't meet the requirement for exact values
3. It has a syntax error
4. The approach is inefficient for this problem

<<<False>>>

Here's a corrected version that uses exact trigonometric identities to solve the problem:

```python
import math

def main():
    # Using trigonometric identities to solve exactly
    # From sin(a) + sin(b) = √(5/3) and cos(a) + cos(b) = 1
    # Let's square and add both equations:
    # (sin a + sin b)^2 + (cos a + cos b)^2 = 5/3 + 1 = 8/3
    # Expanding: sin²a + sin²b + 2sin a sin b + cos²a + cos²b + 2cos a cos b = 8/3
    # Simplify using sin²x + cos²x = 1:
    # 2 + 2(sin a sin b + cos a cos b) = 8/3
    # 2(sin a sin b + cos a cos b) = 2/3
    # sin a sin b + cos a cos b = 1/3
    # But cos(a - b) = cos a cos b + sin a sin b
    # Therefore cos(a - b) = 1/3
    
    # The exact solution is:
    exact_value = 1/3
    print(f"cos(a-b) = {exact_value}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The corrected program:
1. Solves the problem exactly using trigonometric identities
2. Provides the exact value required by the problem
3. Is much more efficient than brute-force enumeration
4. Avoids floating-point approximation issues
5. Meets all the requirements in the problem statement
