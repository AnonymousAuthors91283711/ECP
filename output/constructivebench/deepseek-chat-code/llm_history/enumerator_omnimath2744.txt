This problem involves finding all 5-element subsets of odd numbers between 3 and 99 where:
1. All numbers are odd and > 2
2. The product of the numbers forms a 5-digit number with pattern ab0ab (where a ≠ 0, a ≠ b)

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such subsets and count them.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_ab0ab(n):
    if n < 10000 or n > 99999:
        return False
    s = str(n)
    return s[0] != '0' and s[0] != s[1] and s[2] == '0' and s[0] == s[3] and s[1] == s[4]

def main():
    # Generate all odd numbers between 3 and 99
    numbers = [n for n in range(3, 100) if n % 2 == 1]
    count = 0
    
    for combo in combinations(numbers, 5):
        product = 1
        for num in combo:
            product *= num
            if product > 99999:  # Early exit if product exceeds 5 digits
                break
        
        if 10000 <= product <= 99999 and is_ab0ab(product):
            print(combo, product)
            count += 1
    
    print(f"Total number of valid subsets: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
