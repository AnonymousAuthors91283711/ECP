abbrev omnimath3732_answer : Set (ℝ × ℝ × ℝ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3732 :
  {triple : ℝ × ℝ × ℝ | let (a, b, c) := triple; a^2 + a*b + c = 0 ∧ b^2 + b*c + a = 0 ∧ c^2 + c*a + b = 0} = omnimath3732_answer ↔ True := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking symmetric case a = b = c:
Found symmetric solution: (0, 0, 0)

Checking case a = b ≠ c:
Found solution: (1, 1, -2)

Checking cases with one zero:
Found solution: (0, 0, 0)

Checking distinct small integers:. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ × ℝ × ℝ)
<<<{(0, 0, 0), (1, 1, -2), (1, -2, 1), (-2, 1, 1)}>>>
