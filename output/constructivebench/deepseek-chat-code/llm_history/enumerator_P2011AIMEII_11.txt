[write_program]
This problem involves calculating the determinant of a special tridiagonal matrix and summing a series involving these determinants. We'll write a Python program to compute the determinants D(n) for small values of n, then compute partial sums of the series to help conjecture the pattern.

The matrix M(n) is defined with:
- Diagonal elements = 10
- Off-diagonal elements = 3 when |i-j| = 1, 0 otherwise

We'll compute D(n) using a recurrence relation derived from tridiagonal matrix determinants, then compute partial sums of the series.

```python
def compute_series_terms(max_n):
    # Initialize recurrence for D(n)
    D = [1, 10]  # D[0] = 1 (empty matrix), D[1] = 10
    
    # Compute D(n) using recurrence: D(n) = 10*D(n-1) - 9*D(n-2)
    for n in range(2, max_n + 1):
        D_n = 10 * D[n-1] - 9 * D[n-2]
        D.append(D_n)
    
    # Compute series terms 1/(8*D(n+1)+1) for n >= 1
    series_terms = []
    for n in range(1, max_n):
        denominator = 8 * D[n+1] + 1
        term = 1 / denominator
        series_terms.append(term)
        print(f"n={n}: D(n+1)={D[n+1]}, term={term}")
    
    return series_terms

def compute_partial_sums(terms):
    partial_sum = 0.0
    for i, term in enumerate(terms):
        partial_sum += term
        print(f"Sum of first {i+1} terms: {partial_sum}")
    return partial_sum

def main():
    max_n = 10  # Compute up to D(10)
    print(f"Computing up to n={max_n}")
    terms = compute_series_terms(max_n)
    partial_sum = compute_partial_sums(terms)
    print(f"Final partial sum: {partial_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
