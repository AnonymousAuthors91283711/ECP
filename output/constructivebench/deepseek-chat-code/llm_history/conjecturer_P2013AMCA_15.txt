Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the problem and enumerated patterns, we can see:
1. Parents (2 elements) must have different store assignments from children (3 elements)
2. There are 4 possible stores
3. The count comes from: parents choose any 2 stores (4×3 ways), children choose from remaining 2 stores (2×2×2 ways)

<<<4 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 2>>>
