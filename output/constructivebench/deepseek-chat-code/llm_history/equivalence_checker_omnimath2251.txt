Ground Truth Answer: {(12, 3, 4), (6, 5.4, 7.6)}
Proposed Answer: {(6, 27/5, 38/5)}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but has a missing solution. The ground truth answer includes two solutions: (12, 3, 4) and (6, 5.4, 7.6). The proposed answer only includes the second solution, expressed in fractional form (6, 27/5, 38/5) which is equivalent to (6, 5.4, 7.6). The first solution (12, 3, 4) is missing from the proposed answer.
