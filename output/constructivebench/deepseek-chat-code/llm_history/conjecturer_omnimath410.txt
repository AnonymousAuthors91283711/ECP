From the enumerated answers, we can observe that all valid values of c are in the range [1.0, 2.0). The problem appears to be about finding scaling factors for discrete metrics where we can color the integer grid with finitely many colors while maintaining minimum distance constraints. The pattern suggests c must be less than 2 for such a coloring to exist.
