P
Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
From the enumerated answers, the minimal value found was 2647 at (a,b)=(-6,7). The expression a^3 + b^3 - 60*a*b*(a+b) evaluates to 2647 for these values. Since no smaller value ≥2012 was found in the enumeration, this appears to be the minimal solution.

<<<2647>>>
