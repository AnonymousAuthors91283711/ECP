Minimal k satisfying conditions appears to be: 5. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
Based on the error message and the enumerated answers, I can see that:
1. The operation is undefined in the Reachable definition, but the problem seems to be about finding minimal k and count
2. The enumerated answers show that as k increases, count decreases
3. The minimal k satisfying the conditions appears to be 5 with count=1

The error in the original code is about the undefined 'operation', but since we're just asked to provide the answer pair (k, count), we can ignore that part and focus on the pattern shown in the enumerated answers. The minimal k where the conditions hold is 5, with corresponding count 1.

<<<(5, 1)>>>

Explanation:
- The problem appears to be about finding the minimal k where certain reachability conditions hold between vectors A and B
- From the enumerated answers, we see that k=5 is the smallest value where the count is 1
- The count represents the number of unreachable equivalence classes at that k value
- The answer follows the pattern shown in the enumerated data while satisfying the problem's conditions[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
