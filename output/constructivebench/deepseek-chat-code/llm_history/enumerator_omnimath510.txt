The problem involves calculating a sum over elements in the union of pairwise intersections of three sets (Alice, Bob, Charlie) with different probabilities. We'll enumerate all possible elements (1-6) and compute their contributions to the sum.

```python
def main():
    alice = {1, 2, 3, 4}
    bob = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    charlie = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
    
    total = 0.0
    # Check all possible elements in the union of pairwise intersections
    for x in range(1, 7):
        in_alice = x in alice
        in_bob = x in bob
        in_charlie = x in charlie
        
        # Only consider elements in at least two sets
        if (in_alice and in_bob) or (in_alice and in_charlie) or (in_bob and in_charlie):
            contribution = 0.0
            
            # Case 1: in alice and bob but not charlie
            if in_alice and in_bob and not in_charlie:
                contribution += (1/4) * (1/5) * (5/6)
            
            # Case 2: in alice and charlie but not bob
            if in_alice and not in_bob and in_charlie:
                contribution += (1/4) * (4/5) * (1/6)
            
            # Case 3: in bob and charlie but not alice
            if not in_alice and in_bob and in_charlie:
                contribution += (3/4) * (1/5) * (1/6)
            
            print(f"Element {x}: contribution = {contribution}")
            total += contribution
    
    print(f"Total sum: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
