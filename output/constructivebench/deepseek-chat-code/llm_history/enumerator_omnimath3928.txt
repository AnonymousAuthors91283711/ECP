[write_program]
The problem asks to find all pairs of natural numbers (a, b) such that 7^a - 3^b divides a^4 + b^2. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible pairs (a, b) and check the divisibility condition.

Since 7^a grows much faster than 3^b, we'll limit our search to small values of a and b where the computation remains feasible. For each a, we'll compute 7^a and then find b values where 3^b is close to 7^a, since the difference needs to divide a^4 + b^2.

```python
def find_pairs(max_a=10, max_b=20):
    """Find pairs (a,b) where 7^a - 3^b divides a^4 + b^2"""
    for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
        seven_pow_a = 7 ** a
        a4 = a ** 4
        for b in range(1, max_b + 1):
            three_pow_b = 3 ** b
            diff = seven_pow_a - three_pow_b
            if diff == 0:
                continue  # division by zero
            b2 = b ** 2
            dividend = a4 + b2
            if dividend % diff == 0:
                print(f"Found pair: ({a}, {b})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Searching for pairs (a,b) where 7^a - 3^b divides a^4 + b^2")
    find_pairs()
```
