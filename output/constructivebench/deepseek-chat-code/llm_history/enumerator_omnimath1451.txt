[write_program]
This problem appears to be about finding the maximum size of a set of integer-valued functions where any two distinct functions in the set have an inner product with absolute value ≤ 1. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values for small n.

The approach:
1. For small n (n=1,2,3), we'll generate all possible binary vectors (restricting to {-1,0,1} for practicality)
2. For each set of vectors, check if all pairs satisfy the exquisite condition (inner product ≤ 1)
3. Track the maximum size found for each n

```python
from itertools import product, combinations

def max_exquisite_set_size(n, max_coord=1):
    # Generate all possible vectors in {-max_coord,...,max_coord}^n
    coords = range(-max_coord, max_coord+1)
    all_vectors = list(product(coords, repeat=n))
    
    max_size = 0
    # Check all possible subset sizes in descending order to find maximum quickly
    for size in range(len(all_vectors), 0, -1):
        # Check all combinations of this size
        for vectors in combinations(all_vectors, size):
            exquisite = True
            # Check all pairs in the combination
            for a, b in combinations(vectors, 2):
                inner_product = sum(x*y for x,y in zip(a,b))
                if abs(inner_product) > 1:
                    exquisite = False
                    break
            if exquisite:
                print(f"For n={n}, found set of size {size}: {vectors[:3]}...")
                return size
    return 0

# Test for small values of n
for n in range(1, 5):
    print(f"\nTesting n={n}")
    size = max_exquisite_set_size(n)
    print(f"Maximum exquisite set size for n={n}: {size}")
```

The program:
1. Generates all possible vectors with coordinates in {-1,0,1} for dimensions n=1 to 4
2. Checks combinations of vectors in descending size order to find the largest exquisite set
3. Prints each candidate set found and finally reports the maximum size for each n

Note: We restrict to coordinates in {-1,0,1} for practicality, which should give correct results for small n. For larger n, more sophisticated methods would be needed.
