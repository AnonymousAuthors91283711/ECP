This problem asks for the smallest n ≥ 5 such that there exists a set of n distinct pairs (a,b) where 1 ≤ a,b ≤ 4, with the property that for any two pairs (a_i,b_i) and (a_j,b_j), there exists some pair (a_k,b_k) in the set where both (a_i + a_j - a_k) and (b_i + b_j - b_k) are divisible by 4.

We'll approach this by:
1. Generating all possible pairs (a,b) with 1 ≤ a,b ≤ 4 (there are 16 total)
2. Checking all subsets of size n ≥ 5 to find the smallest n where the condition holds
3. The condition requires that for any two pairs in the subset, their "sum" modulo 4 exists in the subset

```python
from itertools import combinations

def solve():
    # Generate all possible pairs (a,b) where 1 ≤ a,b ≤ 4
    pairs = [(a, b) for a in range(1, 5) for b in range(1, 5)]
    
    # Check subsets from size 5 upwards
    for n in range(5, 17):
        # Check all possible combinations of size n
        for subset in combinations(pairs, n):
            valid = True
            # Check all pairs in the subset
            for (a1, b1), (a2, b2) in combinations(subset, 2):
                # Compute required (a3, b3) modulo 4
                a3 = (a1 + a2) % 4
                a3 = 4 if a3 == 0 else a3
                b3 = (b1 + b2) % 4
                b3 = 4 if b3 == 0 else b3
                # Check if (a3, b3) exists in subset
                if (a3, b3) not in subset:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                print(f"Found valid subset of size {n}:")
                print(sorted(subset))
                print(f"Minimum n is {n}")
                return
        print(f"No valid subsets of size {n} found")
