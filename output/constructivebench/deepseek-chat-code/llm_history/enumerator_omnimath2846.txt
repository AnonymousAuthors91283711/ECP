[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer k such that there exist positive integers m and n satisfying 3*m^3 = 5*n^5 and m + n = k. We'll write a Python program to search for such pairs (m,n) and find the minimal k.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible values of n (starting from 1)
2. For each n, compute the right side 5*n^5
3. Check if this value is divisible by 3, and if so, compute m^3 = (5*n^5)/3
4. Check if the result is a perfect cube
5. If valid, compute k = m + n and track the minimal k found

```python
import math

def is_perfect_cube(x):
    # Check if x is a perfect cube
    root = round(x ** (1/3))
    return root * root * root == x

min_k = None
max_n = 100  # Reasonable upper bound for search

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    rhs = 5 * n**5
    if rhs % 3 != 0:
        continue
    m_cubed = rhs // 3
    if not is_perfect_cube(m_cubed):
        continue
    m = round(m_cubed ** (1/3))
    k = m + n
    print(f"Found solution: m={m}, n={n}, k={k}")
    if min_k is None or k < min_k:
        min_k = k

if min_k is not None:
    print(f"\nMinimal k found: {min_k}")
else:
    print(f"No solutions found for n up to {max_n}")
```
