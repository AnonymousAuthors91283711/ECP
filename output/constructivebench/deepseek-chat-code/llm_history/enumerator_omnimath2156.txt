This problem involves counting the number of occurrences of the subsequence [0,1,2] in all possible positions within the ternary (base-3) representations of numbers from 0 to 728 (3^6-1). We'll write a Python program to enumerate and count these occurrences.

The approach:
1. Generate all numbers from 0 to 728
2. Convert each to its ternary representation (without leading zeros)
3. Scan each representation for the subsequence [0,1,2]
4. Count all valid occurrences where the sequence appears consecutively

```python
def count_012_sequences():
    count = 0
    for n in range(729):
        # Convert to ternary digits, reversed (least significant digit first)
        digits = []
        x = n
        while x > 0:
            digits.append(x % 3)
            x = x // 3
        if not digits:  # handle 0 case
            digits = [0]
        else:
            digits.reverse()  # most significant digit first
        
        # Check for 0,1,2 subsequences
        for i in range(len(digits) - 2):
            if digits[i] == 0 and digits[i+1] == 1 and digits[i+2] == 2:
                count += 1
                print(f"Found at number {n}: {digits} (position {i})")
    
    print(f"Total occurrences: {count}")

count_012_sequences()
```
