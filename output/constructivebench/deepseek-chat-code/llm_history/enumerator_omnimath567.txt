[write_program]
This problem asks for the maximum number of pairs (i,j) with i,j â‰¤ n such that there exists exactly one injective function f mapping each i to j where (i,f(i)) is in the set. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values for small n and observe the pattern.

The approach:
1. For small n (0 to 5), enumerate all possible sets of pairs
2. For each set size k, check if there's exactly one injective function f
3. Track the maximum k that satisfies the condition

```python
from itertools import combinations, permutations

def count_injective_functions(pairs, n):
    """Count injective functions f where (i,f(i)) in pairs for all i<=n"""
    count = 0
    # Try all possible injective functions (permutations of length n+1)
    for f in permutations(range(n+1), n+1):
        valid = True
        for i in range(n+1):
            if (i, f[i]) not in pairs:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1
            if count > 1:  # Early exit if multiple found
                return count
    return count

def find_max_k(n):
    max_k = 0
    all_pairs = [(i,j) for i in range(n+1) for j in range(n+1)]
    
    # Try all possible set sizes from largest to smallest
    for k in range((n+1)**2, 0, -1):
        found = False
        # Check all combinations of size k
        for pairs in combinations(all_pairs, k):
            if count_injective_functions(set(pairs), n) == 1:
                max_k = k
                found = True
                break
        if found:
            break
    return max_k

# Compute for small n values
for n in range(6):
    print(f"n={n}, max_k={find_max_k(n)}")
```
