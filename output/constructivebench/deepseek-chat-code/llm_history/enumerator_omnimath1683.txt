This problem asks for the number of 3-element subsets of a 3×3 grid where no two distinct points are adjacent horizontally or vertically. We'll enumerate all possible combinations to find the count.

The approach:
1. Generate all possible 3-element subsets of the 3×3 grid
2. For each subset, check that no two distinct points are adjacent
3. Count the valid subsets

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_valid(subset):
    for p in subset:
        for q in subset:
            if p == q:
                continue
            # Check horizontal adjacency
            if p[0] == q[0] and abs(p[1] - q[1]) == 1:
                return False
            # Check vertical adjacency
            if p[1] == q[1] and abs(p[0] - q[0]) == 1:
                return False
    return True

def solve():
    grid = [(i, j) for i in range(3) for j in range(3)]
    count = 0
    for subset in combinations(grid, 3):
        if is_valid(subset):
            count += 1
            print(subset)  # Print each valid subset found
    print(f"Total valid subsets: {count}")

solve()
```
