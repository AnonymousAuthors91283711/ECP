[write_program]
This problem asks for the count of numbers `n` ≥ 10^9 that are divisible by 11 and have non-increasing digits when read from left to right. We'll write a Python program to enumerate such numbers up to a reasonable threshold (10^10) to observe patterns and count them.

The approach:
1. Generate numbers with non-increasing digits (digits never increase from left to right)
2. Check divisibility by 11
3. Count numbers ≥ 10^9

```python
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement

def count_special_numbers():
    count = 0
    # We need numbers with 10 digits (since 10^9 has 10 digits)
    digits = '9876543210'
    # Generate all 10-digit non-increasing numbers
    for comb in combinations_with_replacement(digits, 10):
        num_str = ''.join(comb)
        # Skip numbers starting with 0 (they'd have <10 digits)
        if num_str[0] == '0':
            continue
        num = int(num_str)
        if num % 11 == 0:
            count += 1
            print(num)  # Stream found numbers
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

count_special_numbers()
```
