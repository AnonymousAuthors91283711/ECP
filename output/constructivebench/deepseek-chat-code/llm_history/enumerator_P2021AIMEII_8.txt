This problem involves counting paths in a graph with specific conditions. We'll enumerate possible values to find the fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. The problem states there are total_paths = 3*2^7 = 384 possible paths, and successful_paths = 82. The fraction 82/384 simplifies to 41/192, but the problem mentions n=108, suggesting a different interpretation. We'll write a program to explore possible path counts and their simplified fractions.

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def simplify_fraction(numerator, denominator):
    common_divisor = gcd(numerator, denominator)
    return numerator // common_divisor, denominator // common_divisor

def main():
    total_paths = 3 * (2 ** 7)  # 384 paths
    # We'll explore possible successful_paths values around 82
    for successful_paths in range(70, 100):
        simplified_num, simplified_den = simplify_fraction(successful_paths, total_paths)
        print(f"successful_paths={successful_paths}, simplified fraction={simplified_num}/{simplified_den}")
        if simplified_num == 41 and simplified_den == 192:
            print("Found matching fraction 41/192")
        if simplified_num == 41 and simplified_den == 108:
            print("Found matching fraction 41/108")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
