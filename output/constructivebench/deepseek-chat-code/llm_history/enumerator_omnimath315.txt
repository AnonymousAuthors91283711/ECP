[write_program]
This problem involves verifying relationships between harmonic-like sums S(n), T(n), and U(n) for n=1988. To assist in understanding the patterns, we'll write a Python program that computes these sums for smaller values of n and checks the given relationships.

The program will:
1. Compute S(n) as the nth harmonic number
2. Compute T(n) as the sum of S(k) for k from 1 to n
3. Compute U(n) as the sum of T(k)/(k+1) for k from 0 to n-1
4. Verify the given relationships for small n values

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def S(n):
    """Compute the nth harmonic number (sum of 1/k for k=1..n)"""
    return sum(Fraction(1, k) for k in range(1, n+1))

def T(n):
    """Compute sum of S(k) for k=1..n"""
    return sum(S(k) for k in range(1, n+1))

def U(n):
    """Compute sum of T(k)/(k+1) for k=0..n-1"""
    return sum(T(k+1)/Fraction(k+2) for k in range(n))

def verify_relationships(n):
    s_n1 = S(n+1)
    t_n = T(n)
    u_n = U(n)
    
    # Check first relationship: T(n) = (n+1)*S(n+1) - (n+1)
    rel1 = t_n == (n+1)*s_n1 - (n+1)
    
    # Check second relationship: U(n) = (n+2)*S(n+1) - 2*(n+1)
    rel2 = u_n == (n+2)*s_n1 - 2*(n+1)
    
    print(f"n={n}:")
    print(f"  T(n) = {t_n}")
    print(f"  (n+1)*S(n+1)-(n+1) = {(n+1)*s_n1 - (n+1)}")
    print(f"  U(n) = {u_n}")
    print(f"  (n+2)*S(n+1)-2(n+1) = {(n+2)*s_n1 - 2*(n+1)}")
    print(f"  Relationships hold: {rel1 and rel2}")
    print()

# Test small values to observe the pattern
for n in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10]:
    verify_relationships(n)
```
