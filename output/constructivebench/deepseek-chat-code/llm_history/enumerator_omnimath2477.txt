This problem asks for the number of multisets of size 9 where each element is from a set of 26 distinct elements (Fin 26 represents numbers 0-25). This is equivalent to the "stars and bars" combinatorics problem of counting combinations with repetition.

The formula for the number of k-combinations with repetition from a set of size n is C(n+k-1, k). Here n=26 and k=9, so the answer is C(26+9-1, 9) = C(34, 9).

We'll compute this combinatorics value directly in Python using the math.comb function.

```python
import math

def main():
    n = 26  # size of the set (Fin 26)
    k = 9   # size of the multiset
    answer = math.comb(n + k - 1, k)
    print(answer)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
