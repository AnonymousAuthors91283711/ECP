[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer k such that 49 divides the binomial coefficient C(2k, k). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible k values and check this divisibility condition.

The approach:
1. Iterate k from 1 upwards
2. For each k, compute C(2k, k)
3. Check if 49 divides this value
4. The first k satisfying this condition is our answer

We'll optimize by:
- Using memoization for factorials
- Stopping at the first valid k (since we want the minimum)
- Computing binomial coefficients efficiently

```python
import math

def find_min_k():
    # We'll compute binomial coefficients using math.comb (Python 3.8+)
    k = 1
    while True:
        c = math.comb(2*k, k)
        if c % 49 == 0:
            print(f"Found k = {k} with C({2*k}, {k}) = {c}")
            print(f"Minimum k is {k}")
            return
        k += 1
        # Safety limit in case of bugs (should find answer well before this)
        if k > 1000:
            print("Reached limit without finding solution")
            return

find_min_k()
```
