Ground Truth Answer: 2/3
Proposed Answer: 50 / 90
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. First, solve the equation for x:
   4x + 20 + 140 = 360
   => 4x + 160 = 360
   => 4x = 200
   => x = 50

2. Now compute (4 * x) / 360:
   (4 * 50) / 360 = 200 / 360 = 20/36 = 5/9

3. Compare with given answers:
   - Ground truth: 2/3 ≈ 0.666...
   - Proposed: 50/90 = 5/9 ≈ 0.555...

4. The correct simplified form is 5/9, which matches the proposed answer (50/90 simplifies to 5/9).

5. The ground truth answer of 2/3 is incorrect as it doesn't match the calculation.
