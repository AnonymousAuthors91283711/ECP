This problem involves evaluating a trigonometric expression with multiple sine terms. We'll compute the exact value numerically to help conjecture the closed-form solution. The expression is:

sin(6°)sin(12°)sin(24°)sin(42°) + sin(12°)sin(24°)sin(42°)

We'll compute this using Python's math module for exact floating-point calculations.

```python
import math

def compute_expression():
    # Convert degrees to radians
    angles = [6, 12, 24, 42]
    radians = [math.radians(a) for a in angles]
    
    # Compute individual sine terms
    sin6, sin12, sin24, sin42 = [math.sin(r) for r in radians]
    
    # Compute the two parts of the expression
    part1 = sin6 * sin12 * sin24 * sin42
    part2 = sin12 * sin24 * sin42
    total = part1 + part2
    
    return total

result = compute_expression()
print(f"Numerical value: {result}")
print(f"Approximate fraction: {result:.8f}")
```
