[write_program]
This problem asks for all quadruples (a, b, c, k) where a, b, c are primes, k is a positive integer, and they satisfy the equation a² + b² + 16c² = 9k² + 1. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible solutions by checking small prime values and k values up to a reasonable limit.

The approach:
1. Generate small primes for a, b, c
2. For each combination, compute the right side of the equation and check if it equals 9k² + 1 for some k
3. Since c is multiplied by 16, we'll limit c to smaller primes
4. We'll set reasonable bounds for k based on the equation

    if n < 2:
        return False
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]:
        if n % p == 0:
            return n == p
    d = n - 1
    s = 0
    while d % 2 == 0:
        d //= 2
        s += 1

        if a >= n:
            continue
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(s - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)

                break
        else:

    return True

            # Solve 9k^2 + 1 = lhs => k^2 = (lhs - 1)/9
            if lhs <= 1:
                continue
            if (lhs - 1) % 9 != 0:

            k = int(math.isqrt(k_squared))
            if k*k == k_squared and k > 0 and k <= max_k:
                print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, k={k}")
