[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that 3^n ≡ 1 mod 143² (since 143 = 11×13). We'll write a Python program to find the minimal such n by checking divisors of φ(143²) where φ is Euler's totient function.

```python
def compute_min_n():
    # Compute Euler's totient function φ(143²) = φ(11²×13²) = φ(11²)×φ(13²) = 110×156 = 17160
    phi = 17160
    # We need to find minimal n dividing 17160 where 3^n ≡ 1 mod 143²
    mod = 143 * 143
    
    # Generate all divisors of 17160 in sorted order
    def get_divisors():
        factors = [2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 11, 13]  # prime factorization of 17160
        divisors = {1}
        for p in factors:
            new_divisors = set()
            for d in divisors:
                new_divisors.add(d * p)
            divisors.update(new_divisors)
        return sorted(divisors)
    
    divisors = get_divisors()
    
    # Check each divisor in order until we find the minimal n satisfying the condition
    for n in divisors:
        if pow(3, n, mod) == 1:
            print(f"Found candidate: {n}")
            return n
    
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    min_n = compute_min_n()
    print(f"Minimal n is: {min_n}")
```
