[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of equations with three variables x, y, z. We'll write a Python program to:
1. Solve the system symbolically to find exact values
2. Substitute these values into the expression (x/y - z/x - zÂ²/(x*y))
3. Output the simplified result

The approach will be:
1. From hdiff (x - z = 2), express z in terms of x
2. From hprod (x*y = 6), express y in terms of x
3. Substitute into hsum (x + y + z = 9) to get an equation in x only
4. Solve for x, then find y and z
5. Compute the final expression

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, simplify

def solve_problem():
    x, y, z = symbols('x y z')
    
    # Define the equations
    eq1 = Eq(x * y, 6)        # x*y = 6
    eq2 = Eq(x - z, 2)        # x - z = 2
    eq3 = Eq(x + y + z, 9)    # x + y + z = 9
    
    # Solve the system
    solutions = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (x, y, z))
    
    for sol in solutions:
        x_val, y_val, z_val = sol
        print(f"Solution: x = {x_val}, y = {y_val}, z = {z_val}")
        
        # Compute the expression
        expr = x_val/y_val - z_val/x_val - z_val**2/(x_val*y_val)
        simplified = simplify(expr)
        print(f"Expression value: {simplified}\n")
