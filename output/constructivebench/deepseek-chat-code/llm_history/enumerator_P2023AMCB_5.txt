[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimal number of guesses needed to guarantee finding at least one point from any connected pair of points on a 3Ã—3 grid (where connected means adjacent horizontally or vertically). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible configurations and find the minimal n.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_connected(pair):
    """Check if two points are connected (adjacent horizontally or vertically)"""
    a, b = pair
    return (a[0] == b[0] and abs(a[1] - b[1]) == 1) or (a[1] == b[1] and abs(a[0] - b[0]) == 1)

def generate_all_pairs():
    """Generate all connected pairs on a 3x3 grid"""
    points = [(i,j) for i in range(3) for j in range(3)]
    all_pairs = combinations(points, 2)
    return [pair for pair in all_pairs if is_connected(pair)]

def covers_all_pairs(guesses, pairs):
    """Check if guesses cover all connected pairs"""
    return all(any(g in pair for g in guesses) for pair in pairs)

def find_min_guesses():
    pairs = generate_all_pairs()
    print(f"Total connected pairs: {len(pairs)}")
    
    points = [(i,j) for i in range(3) for j in range(3)]
    
    # Try increasing numbers of guesses
    for n in range(1, 10):
        # Try all combinations of n points
        for guesses in combinations(points, n):
            if covers_all_pairs(guesses, pairs):
                print(f"Found covering set with {n} guesses: {guesses}")
                return n
        print(f"No covering set found with {n} guesses")
    
    return -1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    min_guesses = find_min_guesses()
    print(f"Minimum number of guesses needed: {min_guesses}")
```
