[write_program]
This problem involves calculating the probability of a specific dice outcome scenario. We need to enumerate all possible 4-dice rolls (6^4 total outcomes) and count the favorable outcomes where the maximum is exactly 4 (meaning at least one 4 appears, and no numbers greater than 4 appear).

The mathematical expression given is:
favorable_outcomes = 4^4 (all ≤4) - 3^4 (all ≤3) - [5^4 (all ≤5) - 4^4 (all ≤4)]

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Enumerate all possible 4-dice rolls (1-6 on each die)
2. Count rolls where max is exactly 4
3. Calculate the probability as favorable/total

```python
from itertools import product

def main():
    total = 6**4
    favorable = 0
    
    for roll in product(range(1,7), repeat=4):
        max_val = max(roll)
        if max_val == 4:
            favorable += 1
            print(f"Found favorable roll: {roll}")  # Stream partial results
    
    probability = favorable / total
    print(f"\nTotal outcomes: {total}")
    print(f"Favorable outcomes: {favorable}")
    print(f"Probability: {probability} (exact fraction {favorable}/{total})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
