The problem involves calculating the difference in payments between Dave and Doug for sharing a pizza with specific conditions. We'll translate this into Python to compute the exact value.

```python
def calculate_payment_difference():
    total_slices = 8
    plain_cost = 8
    anchovy_cost = 2
    anchovy_slices = total_slices // 2
    plain_slices = total_slices - anchovy_slices
    
    dave_ate_anchovy = anchovy_slices
    dave_ate_plain = 1
    doug_ate_plain = plain_slices - dave_ate_plain
    
    # Calculate payments using exact fractions to avoid floating point inaccuracies
    dave_payment = (dave_ate_plain * plain_cost) / total_slices + (dave_ate_anchovy * (plain_cost + anchovy_cost)) / anchovy_slices
    doug_payment = (doug_ate_plain * plain_cost) / total_slices
    
    difference = dave_payment - doug_payment
    print(f"Payment difference: {difference}")

calculate_payment_difference()
```
