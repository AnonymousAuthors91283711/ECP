[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that n³ ends with 888 (i.e., n³ ≡ 888 mod 1000). We'll write a Python program to find this minimal n by checking cubes modulo 1000.

The approach:
1. Iterate through positive integers n starting from 1
2. For each n, compute n³ mod 1000
3. Check if the result equals 888
4. The first n satisfying this condition is the answer

```python
def find_min_n():
    n = 1
    while True:
        cube_mod = (n ** 3) % 1000
        if cube_mod == 888:
            print(f"Found n = {n} (n³ = {n**3})")
            return n
        n += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    min_n = find_min_n()
    print(f"Minimum n where n³ ends with 888: {min_n}")
```
