[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of positive integer solutions (x,y) to the equation x + 2y = 100. We'll enumerate all possible y values and count valid x pairs.

For each y from 1 upwards:
1. Calculate x = 100 - 2y
2. x must be positive, so 100 - 2y > 0 ⇒ y < 50
3. y must be positive (y ≥ 1)
4. Therefore y ranges from 1 to 49 inclusive

The program will count all valid (x,y) pairs by iterating y from 1 to 49 and checking the conditions.

```python
def count_solutions():
    count = 0
    for y in range(1, 50):  # y from 1 to 49
        x = 100 - 2 * y
        if x > 0:
            count += 1
            print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}")  # Stream partial results
    print(f"Total number of solutions: {count}")  # Final count

count_solutions()
```
