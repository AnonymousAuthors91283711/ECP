This problem is about counting the number of triangles formed by points on the sides of a triangle ABC, where there are additional points on each side. We need to count all possible triangles minus those that are colinear (i.e., all three points lie on the same side).

Here's a Python program that enumerates the solution by calculating combinations:

```python
import math

def count_triangles():
    # Parameters from the problem
    vertices = 3  # A, B, C
    ab_points = 3  # points on AB (excluding A and B)
    bc_points = 4  # points on BC (excluding B and C)
    ca_points = 5  # points on CA (excluding C and A)
    
    total_points = vertices + ab_points + bc_points + ca_points
    
    # Total possible triangles (all combinations of 3 points)
    all_triples = math.comb(total_points, 3)
    
    # Colinear triangles on each side (including vertices)
    colinear_ab = math.comb(vertices - 1 + ab_points, 3)  # AB side has 2 vertices + ab_points
    colinear_bc = math.comb(vertices - 1 + bc_points, 3)  # BC side has 2 vertices + bc_points
    colinear_ca = math.comb(vertices - 1 + ca_points, 3)  # CA side has 2 vertices + ca_points
    
    # Valid triangles = total - colinear ones
    valid_triangles = all_triples - colinear_ab - colinear_bc - colinear_ca
    
    print(f"Total points: {total_points}")
    print(f"All possible triangles: {all_triples}")
    print(f"Colinear on AB: {colinear_ab}")
    print(f"Colinear on BC: {colinear_bc}")
    print(f"Colinear on CA: {colinear_ca}")
    print(f"Valid triangles: {valid_triangles}")

count_triangles()
```
