This problem is about finding the smallest positive integer k such that for any finite set V of size 2016 and any injective function E: V → V, there exists a coloring P: V → Fin k where if two vertices v and w have the same color, then no iterate of E (up to 28 steps) maps v to w.

We'll approach this by:
1. Modeling the problem for smaller sizes first (parameterized)
2. Enumerating possible k values
3. Checking the condition for each k
4. Finding the minimal k that satisfies the condition

```python
def is_valid_coloring(V_size, k, E, P):
    """Check if coloring P satisfies the condition for given E."""
    for v in range(V_size):
        for w in range(V_size):
            if P[v] == P[w]:
                for n in range(1, 29):
                    # Check if E^n(v) = w
                    current = v
                    valid = True
                    for _ in range(n):
                        current = E[current]
                        if current == -1:  # Not defined (shouldn't happen for injective)
                            valid = False
                            break
                    if valid and current == w:
                        return False
    return True

def find_min_k(V_size=6, max_k=10):
    """Find minimal k for small V_size to observe pattern."""
    from itertools import permutations, product

    print(f"Testing for V_size = {V_size}")
    for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
        found = True
        # Test all injective E: V → V (permutations)
        for E in permutations(range(V_size)):
            # Try all possible colorings P: V → [k]
            # Since k might be small, we can check exhaustively for small V_size
            for colors in product(range(k), repeat=V_size):
                if is_valid_coloring(V_size, k, E, colors):
                    break
            else:
                found = False
                break
        
        if found:
            print(f"k = {k} works")
            return k
        else:
            print(f"k = {k} fails")
    
    print("No k found in range")
    return None

# Run for small sizes to observe pattern
find_min_k(V_size=4, max_k=5)
find_min_k(V_size=5, max_k=6)
```
