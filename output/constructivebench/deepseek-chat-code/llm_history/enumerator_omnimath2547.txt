[write_program]
This problem defines a recursive sequence where a(1)=1 and for n>1, a(n) = (a(n-1))! + 1. We need to find the smallest n such that a(n) > 10^10. The Python program will compute the sequence terms until exceeding 10^10 and track the smallest such n.

```python
import math

def compute_sequence():
    a = 1  # a(1) = 1
    n = 1
    threshold = 10**10
    
    while True:
        print(f"a({n}) = {a}")
        if a > threshold:
            print(f"Smallest n where a(n) > 10^10: {n}")
            break
        n += 1
        a = math.factorial(a) + 1

compute_sequence()
```
