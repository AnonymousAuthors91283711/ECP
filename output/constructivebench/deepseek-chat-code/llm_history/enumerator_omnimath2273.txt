This problem involves calculating the probability that two randomly selected cards from a special deck have the same label. The deck has 12 labels with 4 cards each, and 1 label with 2 cards (total 50 cards). We need to enumerate the number of same-label pairs and total possible pairs.

The Python program will:
1. Calculate total pairs (combinations of 2 from 50 cards)
2. Calculate same-label pairs (combinations of 2 within each label)
3. Compute the probability as a fraction

```python
from math import comb
from fractions import Fraction

def calculate_probability():
    # Deck configuration: 12 labels with 4 cards, 1 label with 2 cards
    labels = [4]*12 + [2]
    
    # Calculate total possible pairs
    total_cards = sum(labels)
    total_pairs = comb(total_cards, 2)
    
    # Calculate same-label pairs
    same_label_pairs = sum(comb(n, 2) for n in labels)
    
    # Compute probability as exact fraction
    probability = Fraction(same_label_pairs, total_pairs)
    
    # Print intermediate values and final probability
    print(f"Total cards: {total_cards}")
    print(f"Total pairs: {total_pairs}")
    print(f"Same-label pairs: {same_label_pairs}")
    print(f"Probability: {probability}")

calculate_probability()
