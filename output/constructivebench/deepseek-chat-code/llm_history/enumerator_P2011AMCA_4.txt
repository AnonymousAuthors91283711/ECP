[write_program]
This problem appears to be calculating a weighted average of three numbers (12, 15, 10) with weights (4, 2, 1) respectively. The Python program will compute this weighted average exactly as a fraction.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def calculate_weighted_average():
    # Define the values and their weights
    values = [12, 15, 10]
    weights = [4, 2, 1]
    
    # Calculate numerator (sum of value*weight)
    numerator = sum(v * w for v, w in zip(values, weights))
    
    # Calculate denominator (sum of weights)
    denominator = sum(weights)
    
    # Compute the exact fraction
    result = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
    
    # Print the exact fractional result
    print(f"The weighted average is: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    calculate_weighted_average()
```
