[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number m such that for any two distinct numbers a,b in the range [1, 2n-1], there exist non-zero (but possibly x=0 or y=0, just not both zero) integers x,y with x+y ≤ m where a*x + b*y is divisible by 2n.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Take small values of n (starting from 2)
2. For each n, find the minimal m that satisfies the condition
3. Check all pairs (a,b) in [1,2n-1] with a≠b
4. For each pair, find minimal x,y (not both zero) with x+y ≤ m where 2n divides a*x + b*y

```python
def find_min_m(n):
    max_val = 2 * n - 1
    # Start with m=1 and increment until condition is satisfied
    for m in range(1, 2 * n + 2):  # Reasonable upper bound
        all_pairs_satisfied = True
        for a in range(1, max_val + 1):
            for b in range(1, max_val + 1):
                if a == b:
                    continue
                found = False
                # Check all (x,y) with x+y ≤ m, not both zero
                for s in range(1, m + 1):  # x + y = s
                    for x in range(0, s + 1):
                        y = s - x
                        if x == 0 and y == 0:
                            continue
                        if (a * x + b * y) % (2 * n) == 0:
                            found = True
                            break
                    if found:
                        break
                if not found:
                    all_pairs_satisfied = False
                    break
            if not all_pairs_satisfied:
                break
        if all_pairs_satisfied:
            return m
    return None  # Shouldn't reach here for reasonable n

for n in range(2, 8):  # Test small values
    m = find_min_m(n)
    print(f"n={n}, minimal m={m}")
```
