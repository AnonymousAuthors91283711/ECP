Looking at the enumerated answers, I notice that s(n) equals the factorial of the number of 1's in the binary representation of n. For example:
- s(3)=2 (binary 11 has two 1's, 2! = 2)
- s(7)=6 (binary 111 has three 1's, 3! = 6)
- s(15)=24 (binary 1111 has four 1's, 4! = 24)

Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the enumerated answers, we can observe a pattern where the values of s(n) seem to be factorials of the number of 1's in the binary representation of n. For example:
- s(3) = 2 (binary 11 has two 1's, 2! = 2)
- s(7) = 6 (binary 111 has three 1's, 3! = 6)
- s(15) = 24 (binary 1111 has four 1's, 4! = 24)
- s(31) = 120 (binary 11111 has five 1's, 5! = 120)

The error in the original proposed answer was using `Nat.bitCount` which doesn't exist in Lean. Instead, we should use `Nat.digits 2 n` to get the binary digits and count the 1's, then take the factorial of that count.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<Nat.factorial ((Nat.digits 2 1000).filter (· = 1)).length>>>

Explanation:
1. `Nat.digits 2 1000` converts 1000 to its binary representation as a list of digits
2. `.filter (· = 1)` keeps only the 1's in this list
3. `.length` counts how many 1's there are
4. `Nat.factorial` takes the factorial of this count

This matches the observed pattern in the enumerated answers and should correctly compute s(1000) based on the given recurrence relations.
