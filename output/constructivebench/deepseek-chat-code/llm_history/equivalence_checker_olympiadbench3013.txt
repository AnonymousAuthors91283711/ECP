Ground Truth Answer: 66/7
Proposed Answer: 24
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves a system of logarithmic equations with positive real variables x, y, z.
2. The ground truth answer is 66/7 ≈ 9.42857
3. The proposed answer is 24

The two answers are clearly different numerically (24 vs 9.42857). The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth, and there's no obvious transformation that would make them equivalent.
