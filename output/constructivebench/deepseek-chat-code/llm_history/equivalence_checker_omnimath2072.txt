Ground Truth Answer: (27 * sqrt 6 / 8) * π
Proposed Answer: (4 * Real.pi * (sqrt 5)^3) / 3
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: (27 * sqrt 6 / 8) * π
   - Simplified form: (27√6/8)π ≈ 25.918π

2. Proposed Answer: (4 * π * (√5)^3)/3
   - (√5)^3 = 5√5
   - So this becomes (4π * 5√5)/3 = (20√5/3)π ≈ 14.907π

The numerical values are significantly different (25.918π vs 14.907π), and the algebraic forms don't appear to be equivalent transformations of each other. The ground truth involves √6 while the proposed answer involves √5.
