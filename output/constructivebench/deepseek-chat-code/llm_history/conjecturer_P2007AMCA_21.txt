Looking at the enumerated answers and the problem conditions, we can observe that:
1. The sum of zeros (-b/a) equals the product of zeros (c/a) equals the sum of coefficients (a+b+c)
2. From the enumerated cases, we see the pattern that sum_zeros = -b/a = 2 when we solve the system of equations

The key insight comes from setting sum_zeros = prod_zeros = sum_coeffs:
1. -b/a = c/a ⇒ -b = c
2. c/a = a+b+c ⇒ -b/a = a+b-b ⇒ -b/a = a ⇒ b = -a²

Substituting back into sum_zeros (-b/a):
-b/a = -(-a²)/a = a²/a = a

Thus the correct answer should simply be 'a'. The proposed answer (a+b)/(a-b) was incorrect.

Here's the corrected answer:
<<<fun a b c => a>>>

The error message about noncomputable was a red herring - the real issue was the incorrect formula. The correct solution satisfies all given conditions and matches the enumerated cases.
