theorem omnimath1581 : 
  ∑ x in (Finset.range 2019).filter (fun x => f (x + 1) = 19), (x + 1) = omnimath1581_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found match at x=44, n=45
Found match at x=108, n=109
Found match at x=236, n=237
Found match at x=492, n=493
Found match at x=1004, n=1005
Final sum: 1889. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the enumerated answers, we notice the pattern: n = 19*2^k + 1 for k=1 to 5 (45=19*2+1, 109=19*4+1, etc.). The sum is 19*(2+4+8+16+32)+5 = 19*62+5 = 1183. However, the enumerated sum is 1889, which suggests the pattern might be different. 

After closer inspection, the correct pattern appears to be n = 19*2^k - 1 for k=1 to 5 (45=19*2+7, but this doesn't fit). Alternatively, the sum matches 19*2^7 - 39 = 1889.
