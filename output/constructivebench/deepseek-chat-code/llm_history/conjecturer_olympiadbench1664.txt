Based on the problem statement involving counting monochromatic triples with a modular condition and the target value 2007, the answer likely involves numbers where 2007 can be expressed as a combination of cubic terms. Considering 2007 = 3^3 * 223 + 0^3, the solution set probably contains numbers where this counting condition holds.
