[write_program]
This problem involves analyzing a recursively defined sequence of lists of natural numbers and counting how many of the first 1000 terms are palindromes. The sequence is defined with initial conditions a(1) = [1], a(2) = [0], and the recurrence relation a(n+3) = a(n+2) ++ reverse(a(n+1)).

To approach this, we'll:
1. Implement the sequence generation exactly as defined
2. Check each term for palindrome property (w == reverse(w))
3. Count palindromic terms up to n=1000

The program will generate terms sequentially and check each one, printing counts periodically to show progress.

```python
def generate_sequence(n_max):
    # Initialize sequence with first two terms
    seq = {1: [1], 2: [0]}
    
    for n in range(3, n_max + 1):
        # Apply recurrence: a(n) = a(n-1) + reverse(a(n-2))
        new_term = seq[n-1] + seq[n-2][::-1]
        seq[n] = new_term
        yield n, new_term

def is_palindrome(lst):
    return lst == lst[::-1]

def count_palindromes():
    count = 0
    palindrome_indices = []
    n_max = 1000
    
    for n, term in generate_sequence(n_max):
        if is_palindrome(term):
            count += 1
            palindrome_indices.append(n)
            # Print every 50 terms to show progress
            if n % 50 == 0 or n == n_max:
                print(f"Up to n={n}: found {count} palindromes")
    
    print("\nFinal count of palindromic terms up to n=1000:", count)
    print("Indices of palindromic terms:", palindrome_indices)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    count_palindromes()
```
