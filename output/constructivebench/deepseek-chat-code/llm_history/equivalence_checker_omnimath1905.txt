Ground Truth Answer: 341
Proposed Answer: (2^10 - (-1)^10)/3
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer (2^10 - (-1)^10)/3 evaluates to (1024 - 1)/3 = 1023/3 = 341, which matches the ground truth answer. This is a known closed-form solution for the number of equal adjacent pairs in the nth iteration of this particular AB substitution system. The equivalence is exact.
