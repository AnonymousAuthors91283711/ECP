abbrev omnimath3799_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3799 :
  {n : ℕ | n ≥ 1 ∧ ∃ k : ℤ, k^2 = n * 2^(n+1) + 1} = omnimath3799_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking n from 1 to 100 where n*2^(n+1)+1 is a perfect square:
Found solution: n = 3
Verification: 3*2^4+1 = 49 = 7^2. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
