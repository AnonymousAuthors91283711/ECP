This problem involves calculating the probability that a randomly selected 2-element subset of {1,2,3,4,5,6} contains at least one element â‰¤4. We'll enumerate all possible 2-element subsets and count those meeting the condition.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def main():
    tickets = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
    k = 2
    total_subsets = 0
    valid_subsets = 0
    
    for subset in combinations(tickets, k):
        total_subsets += 1
        if any(x <= 4 for x in subset):
            valid_subsets += 1
            print(f"Valid subset found: {subset}")
    
    print(f"Total subsets: {total_subsets}")
    print(f"Valid subsets: {valid_subsets}")
    print(f"Probability: {valid_subsets}/{total_subsets}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
