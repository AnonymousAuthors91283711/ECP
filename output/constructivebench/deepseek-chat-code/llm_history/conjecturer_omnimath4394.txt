Based on the problem statement and the fact that no solutions were found in the enumeration, I conjecture that there are no natural number triples (a,b,c) satisfying the given equation. The gcd conditions combined with the sum equaling 199 (a prime number) appears to be impossible to satisfy with positive integers.
