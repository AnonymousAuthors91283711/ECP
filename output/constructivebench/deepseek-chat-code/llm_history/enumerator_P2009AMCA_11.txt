[write_program]
This problem involves a recursive function F(n) defined for natural numbers, and asks to find a closed-form expression for it. The recursive definition is:
- F(0) = 1
- F(1) = 1
- F(2) = 5
- F(n+3) = F(n+2) + 4*(n+2) for n â‰¥ 0

We'll write a Python program to compute F(n) for small values of n and look for patterns that might suggest a closed-form solution. The program will compute and print F(n) for n up to 20.

```python
def compute_F(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        return 5
    else:
        # Initialize the memoization array
        memo = [0] * (n + 1)
        memo[0], memo[1], memo[2] = 1, 1, 5
        
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            memo[i] = memo[i-1] + 4 * (i-1)
        
        return memo[n]

# Print F(n) for n from 0 to 20
print("n\tF(n)")
for n in range(21):
    print(f"{n}\t{compute_F(n)}")
```

The program computes F(n) using dynamic programming to avoid redundant recursive calls. It prints the values of F(n) for n from 0 to 20, which should help identify the pattern and potential closed-form solution. The output shows how F(n) grows with n, and the relationship between consecutive terms (each term adds 4*(n-1) to the previous term).
