[write_program]
This problem involves finding natural numbers t and w that satisfy two equations:
1. 3t + 2w + (w+1) = 61
2. 2w = 3t
And asks for the value of w+1.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of t and w that satisfy these equations, with a reasonable upper bound for efficiency.

```python
def solve():
    # We'll search up to t=20 since 3*20=60 is close to 61
    max_t = 20
    for t in range(1, max_t + 1):
        # From equation 2: 2w = 3t => w = (3t)/2
        if (3 * t) % 2 != 0:
            continue  # w must be integer
        w = (3 * t) // 2
        
        # Check equation 1: 3t + 2w + (w+1) = 61
        if 3 * t + 2 * w + (w + 1) == 61:
            print(f"t={t}, w={w}, w+1={w+1}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```
