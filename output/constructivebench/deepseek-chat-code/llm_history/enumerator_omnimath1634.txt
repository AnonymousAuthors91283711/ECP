This problem involves finding the number of non-negative integers less than 2008 that belong to a recursively defined set S. The set S is defined as the intersection of all subsets T of integers containing 0 and closed under the operations x ↦ 3x and x ↦ 3x + 1.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such numbers below 2008 by building the set S incrementally. The approach is to start with {0} and repeatedly apply the generating operations until no new numbers below 2008 can be added.

```python
def enumerate_omnimath1634():
    max_n = 2008
    S = {0}
    queue = [0]
    
    while queue:
        x = queue.pop(0)
        for new_x in [3 * x, 3 * x + 1]:
            if new_x < max_n and new_x not in S:
                S.add(new_x)
                queue.append(new_x)
                print(f"Found new element: {new_x}")
    
    S_filtered = sorted([x for x in S if x >= 0])
    print(f"\nTotal elements in S ∩ [0, 2008): {len(S_filtered)}")
    print("All elements:", S_filtered)

enumerate_omnimath1634()
```

The program:
1. Initializes S with {0}
2. Uses a queue to process each element
3. For each element x, generates 3x and 3x+1
4. Adds new elements to S if they're < 2008
5. Prints each new element as it's found
6. Finally reports the count and list of all valid elements

This will output all numbers in S below 2008 and their count, which is the answer to the problem. The set grows exponentially but stays manageable below 2008.
