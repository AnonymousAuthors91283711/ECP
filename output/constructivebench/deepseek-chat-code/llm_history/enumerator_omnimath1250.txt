The problem asks for the sum of i*j*k for all triples (i,j,k) where i+j+k=17 and each of i,j,k is a natural number between 0 and 16 (inclusive). We need to enumerate all valid triples and compute their product sum.

Here's a Python program that:
1. Iterates through all possible i,j,k in 0..16
2. Checks if i+j+k equals 17
3. If valid, accumulates the product i*j*k
4. Outputs the final sum

```python
def solve():
    total = 0
    for i in range(17):
        for j in range(17):
            for k in range(17):
                if i + j + k == 17:
                    total += i * j * k
    print(total)

solve()
```
