This problem asks for the number of integer quadruples (a, b, c, d) where each coordinate has absolute value â‰¤ 5 that satisfy a specific equation. The equation relates the sum of squares to a product of three terms. We'll enumerate all possible combinations within the given bounds and count those that satisfy the equation.

The approach is:
1. Iterate through all possible combinations of a, b, c, d from -5 to 5
2. For each combination, check if it satisfies the given equation
3. Count and print valid solutions as we find them
4. Finally print the total count

```python
def main():
    count = 0
    for a in range(-5, 6):
        for b in range(-5, 6):
            for c in range(-5, 6):
                for d in range(-5, 6):
                    # Compute left side of equation
                    left = (a**2 + b**2 + c**2 + d**2)**2
                    # Compute the three factors on right side
                    f1 = (a + b + c + d)
                    f2 = (a - b + c - d)
                    f3 = ((a - c)**2 + (b - d)**2)
                    right = f1 * f2 * f3
                    # Check if equation holds
                    if left == right:
                        count += 1
                        print(f"Found solution: ({a}, {b}, {c}, {d})")
    print(f"Total solutions: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
