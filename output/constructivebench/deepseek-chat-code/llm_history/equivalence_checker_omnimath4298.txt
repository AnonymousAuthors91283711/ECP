Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 3^(n + 1) - 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 3^(2*n) - 3^n + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal number m for which a special type of matrix exists with certain properties. The matrix has size 3ⁿ × 3ⁿ.

2. The ground truth answer is 3^(n+1) - 1, which grows exponentially with n.

3. The proposed answer is 3^(2n) - 3^n + 1, which grows much faster (as 3^(2n) rather than 3^(n+1)).

For small values of n:
- When n=1:
  - Ground truth: 3^(2)-1 = 8
  - Proposed: 3^(2)-3^1+1 = 9-3+1 = 7
  These don't match.

- When n=2:
  - Ground truth: 3^3-1 = 26
  - Proposed: 3^4-3^2+1 = 81-9+1 = 73
  These are very different.

The proposed answer grows much faster than the ground truth and doesn't match even for small cases. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
