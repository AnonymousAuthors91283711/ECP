abbrev omnimath3703_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3703 :
    {a : ℝ |
      ∃ f : ℝ → ℝ,
        ∀ x y : ℝ,
          x + a * f y ≤ y + f (f x)} = omnimath3703_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 
Testing a = 0
No linear solutions found

Testing a = 0.5
No linear solutions found

Testing a = 1
Found valid k = 1.0
Solution: f(x) = 1.0x

Testing a = 1.5
No linear solutions found

Testing a = 2
No linear solutions found

Testing a = 2.5
No linear solutions found

Testing a = 3
No linear solutions found. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
From the enumeration, only a=1 yields a linear solution f(x) = x. For other values, no linear solutions exist. The pattern suggests the answer is the singleton set containing 1.
