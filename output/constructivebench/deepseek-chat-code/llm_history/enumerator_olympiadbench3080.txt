[write_program]
This problem asks to find the smallest natural number `N` (called `olympiadbench3080_answer` in the Lean code) such that when we expand the product of two quadratic polynomials in `N`, the resulting coefficients of `N^2`, `N`, and the constant term (X, Y, Z) are all less than `N`. 

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Enumerate possible values of N starting from 1
2. For each N, compute the product (2N² + 5N + 3)(3N² + 4N + 1)
3. Expand this product and extract coefficients X, Y, Z
4. Check if X, Y, Z are all < N
5. The first N satisfying this condition is our answer

```python
def find_min_N():
    for N in range(1, 100):  # Reasonable upper bound
        # Compute the product (2N² + 5N + 3)(3N² + 4N + 1)
        # Expanded form: 6N⁴ + (8+15)N³ + (2+20+9)N² + (5+12)N + 3
        # = 6N⁴ + 23N³ + 31N² + 17N + 3
        # Compare with given form: 7N⁴ + 4N³ + XN² + YN + Z
        # So coefficients are:
        # For N⁴: 6 = 7 → Doesn't match, but problem says "=", so likely typo in Lean code
        # Wait, the problem seems to have a mismatch in the N⁴ coefficient
        
        # Alternative interpretation: Maybe the RHS is the expansion minus 7N⁴ + 4N³
        # So XN² + YN + Z = (2N²+5N+3)(3N²+4N+1) - 7N⁴ - 4N³
        product = (2*N*N + 5*N + 3) * (3*N*N + 4*N + 1)
        rhs_part = 7*N**4 + 4*N**3
        remainder = product - rhs_part
        
        # Extract coefficients from remainder = X*N² + Y*N + Z
        # We can find X, Y, Z by polynomial division or coefficient extraction
        Z = remainder % N
        remainder = (remainder - Z) // N
        Y = remainder % N
        remainder = (remainder - Y) // N
        X = remainder
        
        if X < N and Y < N and Z < N:
            print(f"N = {N}, X = {X}, Y = {Y}, Z = {Z}")
            print(f"Found minimal N: {N}")
            return
    
    print("No solution found in range")
