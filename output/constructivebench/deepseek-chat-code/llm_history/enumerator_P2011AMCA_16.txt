This problem involves counting the number of functions from a 5-element set to a 6-element set with certain constraints on function values. Specifically, for any two indices i and j where the absolute difference is 2 or 3, the function values must differ. We'll enumerate all possible functions satisfying these constraints.

The approach is:
1. Represent the domain as {0,1,2,3,4} (Fin 5)
2. For each possible function, check the constraints that f(i) â‰  f(j) when |i-j| is 2 or 3
3. Count all valid functions

We'll implement this by generating all possible functions (6^5 possibilities) and filtering them based on the constraints.

```python
from itertools import product

def is_valid(f):
    for i in range(5):
        for j in range(i+1, 5):
            diff = abs(i - j)
            if (diff == 2 or diff == 3) and f[i] == f[j]:
                return False
    return True

def enumerate_functions():
    count = 0
    # Generate all possible functions from {0,1,2,3,4} to {0,1,2,3,4,5}
    for f in product(range(6), repeat=5):
        if is_valid(f):
            count += 1
            print(f"Found valid function: {f}")  # Stream partial results
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

enumerate_functions()
```
