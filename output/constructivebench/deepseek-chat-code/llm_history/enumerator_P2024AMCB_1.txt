[write_program]
This problem is asking to find the natural number `n` such that there exists a natural number `k` where `k = 1013` and `n - k + 1 = 1010`. The solution involves solving for `n` in the equation `n - 1013 + 1 = 1010` (since `k` is fixed at 1013). 

We'll write a Python program that:
1. Solves the equation algebraically (n = 1010 + 1013 - 1)
2. Prints the solution since it's straightforward to compute

```python
# Solve n - 1013 + 1 = 1010 => n = 1010 + 1013 - 1
n = 1010 + 1013 - 1
print(n)
```
