[write_program]
The problem involves finding the ratio w/y given several linear relationships between variables w, x, y, z. We'll write a Python program to verify the relationships and compute the ratio symbolically.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve_ratio():
    # Let's choose x as the free variable (denominator will cancel out)
    x = Fraction(1)  # Arbitrary value since relationships are proportional
    
    # Given relationships
    z = Fraction(1,6) * x
    y = Fraction(3,2) * z
    w = Fraction(4,3) * x
    
    # Compute the ratio w/y
    ratio = w / y
    
    # Print the simplified fraction
    print(f"w/y = {ratio.numerator}/{ratio.denominator}")

solve_ratio()
```
