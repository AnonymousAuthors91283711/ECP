The problem involves comparing two sums A and B, and finding the absolute difference between them. We'll compute both sums symbolically and numerically to verify the difference.

```python
def compute_A():
    """Compute sum A: sum_{k=0}^{19} [(2k+1)(2k+2) + 39]"""
    total = 0
    for k in range(20):
        term = (2*k + 1) * (2*k + 2) + 39
        total += term
    return total

def compute_B():
    """Compute sum B: 1 + sum_{k=0}^{18} [(2k+2)(2k+3) + 38*39]"""
    total = 1  # initial term
    for k in range(19):
        term = (2*k + 2) * (2*k + 3) + 38 * 39
        total += term
    return total

A = compute_A()
B = compute_B()
difference = abs(A - B)

print(f"A = {A}")
print(f"B = {B}")
print(f"|A - B| = {difference}")
```
