Based on the problem statement and error message, I notice several issues:
1. The Lean syntax is incorrect - the `let` declarations should be separated by semicolons or line breaks
2. The enumerated answers show the correct ratio is indeed 3/7
3. The problem involves calculating a probability ratio of same-type pairs to valid stopping pairs

The error occurs because Lean requires proper separation between `let` bindings. However, since we only need to provide the final answer (3/7) as a rational number, we can ignore the theorem statement's syntax issues.

Here's the corrected final answer in Lean:

<<<3/7>>> 

Explanation:
- The problem involves calculating a probability ratio
- From the enumerated answers:
  - sameTypePairs = 3
  - validStoppingPairs = 7 (3 same-type + 4 synthetic-complex)
- Therefore the ratio is 3/7
- The answer is given as a rational number (ℚ) in Lean using the division operator /[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
