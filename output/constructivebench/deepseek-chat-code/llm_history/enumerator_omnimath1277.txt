This problem involves finding the longest path on a 7x7 grid where:
1. The path starts at (0,0)
2. Each step moves to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, right, or diagonal)
3. No two steps can have the same second coordinate (y-value)
4. The path must not revisit any cell

We'll approach this by implementing a depth-first search (DFS) to explore all possible paths while tracking visited y-coordinates.

```python
def main():
    size = 7
    max_length = 0
    best_path = None
    
    def dfs(x, y, visited, path, used_y):
        nonlocal max_length, best_path
        if len(path) > max_length:
            max_length = len(path)
            best_path = path.copy()
            print(f"New max length: {max_length}, path: {path}")
        
        for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:
            for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:
                if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
                    continue  # skip staying in same cell
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if 0 <= nx < size and 0 <= ny < size:
                    if (nx, ny) not in visited and ny not in used_y:
                        visited.add((nx, ny))
                        used_y.add(ny)
                        path.append((nx, ny))
                        dfs(nx, ny, visited, path, used_y)
                        path.pop()
                        used_y.remove(ny)
                        visited.remove((nx, ny))
    
    # Start from (0,0)
    initial_visited = {(0, 0)}
    initial_used_y = {0}
    dfs(0, 0, initial_visited, [(0, 0)], initial_used_y)
    
    print(f"Final maximum path length: {max_length}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
