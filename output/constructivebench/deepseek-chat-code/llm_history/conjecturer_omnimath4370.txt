  ∃ (s : Finset ℕ), s.card = 100 ∧ (∀ x ∈ s, ∀ y ∈ s, x ≠ y) ∧ 
  ∃ m ∈ s, m^3 = (∑ x in s.erase m, x^3) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 
Searching for set size 3:
No set found up to 50

Searching for set size 4:
Found set: (1, 6, 8, 9) with m=9

Searching for set size 5:
Found set: (1, 5, 7, 12, 13) with m=13

Note: For set size 100, a mathematical construction would be needed. Expected Answer Type: Prop
<<<∃ (s : Finset ℕ), s.card = 100 ∧ (∀ x ∈ s, ∀ y ∈ s, x ≠ y) ∧ ∃ m ∈ s, m^3 = (∑ x in s.erase m, x^3)>>>
