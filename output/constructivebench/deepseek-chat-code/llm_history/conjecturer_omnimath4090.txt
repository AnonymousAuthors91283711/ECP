  (appropriate candidates) ↔ omnimath4090_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found case where all candidates are universal
Appropriate subsets: ()
Perspective subsets: []
---. Expected Answer Type: Prop
Based on the problem statement and enumerated answers, the key observation is that when all candidates are universal (h5), no subsets satisfy the perspective condition (empty list in enumerated answers), making the appropriate condition for candidates vacuously true. The answer should reflect this logical equivalence.
