Enumerated answers: Numbers in S up to threshold: [0, 8, 9, 16, 17, 18, 24, 25, 26, 27, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100]
Largest missing number: 55
Cardinality of S up to threshold: 73
Total cardinality (including all numbers > max_missing): 118. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<118>>> 

Explanation: The problem defines a set S containing 0 and closed under adding 8 or 9. The enumerated answers show all numbers ≥56 are in S, with 55 being the largest missing number. The total cardinality is 56 (numbers 0-55 not in S) + 62 (numbers ≥56 in S) = 118. The pattern suggests the answer is 118.
