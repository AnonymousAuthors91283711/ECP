[write_program]
This problem is about finding the smallest period `t` for which the Fibonacci sequence `F` (defined by F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(n+2)=F(n+1)+F(n)) satisfies F(n) = F(n+t) for all n>0. The Fibonacci sequence is periodic modulo any positive integer, and we need to find the smallest period where it repeats completely.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Generate Fibonacci numbers modulo different periods
2. Check for the smallest period where the sequence repeats
3. Stop when we find the smallest such period (Pisano period for modulus 1)

```python
def find_min_period():
    # We'll check periods up to 100, which is more than enough for the actual answer
    max_period_to_check = 100
    
    for t in range(1, max_period_to_check + 1):
        # Generate Fibonacci sequence modulo t
        fib = [1, 1]  # F(1) and F(2)
        periodic = True
        
        for n in range(3, 2*t + 2):  # Check enough terms to detect periodicity
            next_val = (fib[-1] + fib[-2]) % t
            fib.append(next_val)
            
            # Check if we've completed a full period
            if n > t and fib[n-1] != fib[n-1 - t]:
                periodic = False
                break
        
        if periodic:
            # Verify the period is minimal by checking divisors
            is_minimal = True
            for d in range(1, t):
                if t % d == 0:
                    # Check if d is also a period
                    valid = True
                    for i in range(1, min(2*d + 2, len(fib))):
                        if i + d < len(fib) and fib[i] != fib[i + d]:
                            valid = False
                            break
                    if valid:
                        is_minimal = False
                        break
            if is_minimal:
                print(f"Found candidate period: {t}")
                return t
    
    print("No period found within the search range")
    return None

find_min_period()
```
