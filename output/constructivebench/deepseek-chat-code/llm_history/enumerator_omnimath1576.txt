[write_program]
The problem asks to find all positive integers `n` such that there exists an integer `x` satisfying the equation `x^n + (2 + x)^n + (2 - x)^n = 0`. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of `n` and check for solutions.

Key observations:
1. For even `n`, all terms are non-negative, so their sum can't be zero unless all terms are zero (which isn't possible for positive `n`).
2. For odd `n`, we can look for solutions where the terms cancel out.

We'll check small odd values of `n` and see if any integer `x` satisfies the equation.

```python
def check_equation(n, x):
    return x**n + (2 + x)**n + (2 - x)**n == 0

max_n = 20  # Check up to n=19 (odd numbers below 20)
solutions = []

for n in range(1, max_n + 1, 2):  # Only check odd n
    found = False
    # Check x values in a reasonable range where terms might cancel
    for x in range(-10, 11):
        if check_equation(n, x):
            solutions.append(n)
            print(f"Found solution: n = {n}, x = {x}")
            found = True
            break
    if not found:
        print(f"No solution found for n = {n}")

print("\nPossible solution set:", sorted(set(solutions)))
```
