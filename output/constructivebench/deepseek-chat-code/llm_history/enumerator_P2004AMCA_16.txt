This problem asks for the least real number c such that for all x > c, there exists a real y satisfying y^2002 = x - 2001^2002. The equation y^2002 = x - 2001^2002 has a real solution y if and only if x - 2001^2002 â‰¥ 0. Therefore, the minimal c is when x - 2001^2002 = 0, meaning c = 2001^2002.

Here's a Python program that verifies this by checking values around 2001^2002 (using a smaller exponent for practicality):

```python
def main():
    # Using smaller exponent for demonstration (original was 2002)
    exponent = 4
    base = 2001
    
    # The theoretical answer is base^exponent
    theoretical_c = base ** exponent
    
    # Check values around the theoretical answer
    epsilon = 1
    for delta in [-epsilon, 0, epsilon]:
        c = theoretical_c + delta
        # Verify the condition: for x > c, x - base^exponent >= 0
        # We just need to check the boundary case
        boundary_condition = (c + 0.1) - base**exponent >= 0
        
        print(f"c = {c}: {'Satisfies' if boundary_condition else 'Fails'} condition")
    
    # The minimal c is when x - base^exponent = 0
    print(f"\nMinimal c is {theoretical_c}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
