[write_program]
This problem involves counting certain sequences modulo n with specific difference constraints. For part A (isPartB=False), the constraint is that consecutive differences can't equal i+1 mod n. For part B (isPartB=True), there are additional constraints.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate valid sequences for small odd n values (both prime and composite) to help identify patterns. The program will:
1. Handle both parts A and B
2. Generate all possible sequences of length n+1 with values in 0..n-1
3. Check the circular condition (last equals first) and difference constraints
4. Count valid sequences for small n values

```python
from itertools import product

def is_valid_sequence(seq, n, is_part_b):
    if seq[0] != seq[-1]:
        return False
    for i in range(n):
        diff = (seq[i+1] - seq[i]) % n
        forbidden = [(i+1) % n]
        if is_part_b:
            forbidden.append((2*(i+1)) % n)
        if diff in forbidden:
            return False
    return True

def count_sequences(n, is_part_b):
    count = 0
    # First n elements can vary, last must equal first
    for first_part in product(range(n), repeat=n):
        seq = list(first_part) + [first_part[0]]
        if is_valid_sequence(seq, n, is_part_b):
            count += 1
    return count

def main():
    sample_n_values = [3, 5, 7, 9]  # Includes both prime and composite odd numbers
    for is_part_b in [False, True]:
        print(f"\nPart {'B' if is_part_b else 'A'}:")
        for n in sample_n_values:
            if is_part_b and not all(n % i != 0 for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1)):
                continue  # Skip composite n for part B
            count = count_sequences(n, is_part_b)
            print(f"n={n}: {count} sequences")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
