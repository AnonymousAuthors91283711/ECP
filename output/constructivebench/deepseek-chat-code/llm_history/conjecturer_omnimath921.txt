theorem omnimath921 :
  card {S : Finset (Fin 2014 × Fin 4) | Odd (card (image Prod.fst S : Finset (Fin 2014)))} = omnimath921_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=1, k=1: 2
n=1, k=2: 4
n=1, k=3: 8

n=5, k=3: 128. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern in the enumerated answers, we can see that for each n and k, the answer is 2^(n + k - 1). For the specific problem where n=2014 and k=4, we can generalize this pattern.

<<<2^(2014 + 4 - 1)>>>
