[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that sin(n(n+1)π/2008) is an integer (which must be 0 since sin outputs are in [-1,1]). We need to find the minimal n where n(n+1)π/2008 is an integer multiple of π, meaning n(n+1) must be divisible by 2008.

We'll write a Python program to find the smallest n where 2008 divides n(n+1). Since n and n+1 are coprime, either n or n+1 must be divisible by the required factors of 2008. We'll factorize 2008 and search for the minimal n.

```python
def factorize(n):
    factors = {}
    # Factor out 2s
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors[2] = factors.get(2, 0) + 1
        n = n // 2
    # Check odd divisors up to sqrt(n)
    i = 3
    max_factor = int(n**0.5) + 1
    while i <= max_factor:
        while n % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            n = n // i
            max_factor = int(n**0.5) + 1
        i += 2
    if n > 1:
        factors[n] = 1
    return factors

            x = (-1) * d * pow(d, -1, m) % (d * m)
