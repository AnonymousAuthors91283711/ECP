Ground Truth Answer: fun m n => if m = 0 then 1 else if n = 0 then 1 else 
    let d := Nat.gcd m n
    let m' := m / d
    let n' := n / d
    if n' = 1 then 1 else m' + n' - 1
Proposed Answer: fun m n => if m = n then m else if m.gcd n = 1 then m + n - 1 else m + n - m.gcd n
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. First, let's consider the case when m = 0 or n = 0:
   - Ground truth handles these cases explicitly (returns 1)
   - Proposed answer doesn't handle them specially (would fall through to other cases)
   - This is a difference in behavior

2. For the general case:
   - Ground truth computes d = gcd(m,n), m' = m/d, n' = n/d
   - Then returns 1 if n'=1, else m'+n'-1
   - Proposed answer has three cases:
     a) m = n: returns m
     b) gcd(m,n)=1: returns m+n-1
     c) else: returns m+n-gcd(m,n)

3. Let's test some examples:
   - m=4, n=2:
     - Ground truth: d=2, m'=2, n'=1 → returns 1
     - Proposed: gcd=2 → returns 4+2-2=4
     - Different results
   - m=6, n=4:
     - Ground truth: d=2, m'=3, n'=2 → returns 3+2-1=4
     - Proposed: gcd=2 → returns 6+4-2=8
     - Different results
   - m=5, n=3 (coprime):
     - Both return 5+3-1=7
     - Same result
   - m=4, n=4:
     - Ground truth: d=4, m'=1, n'=1 → returns 1
     - Proposed: returns 4
     - Different results

The answers only agree when m and n are coprime or when both are 0 (but proposed answer doesn't handle 0 case correctly). In most other cases, they give different results.
