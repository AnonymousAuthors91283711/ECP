    (Nat.Prime p ∧ 0 < n ∧ (n^p + 1) % (p^n + 1) = 0) ↔ (p, n) ∈ omnimath3925_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(p, n) | (Nat.Prime p ∧ n = p) ∨ (p = 2 ∧ n = 4)}
Proposed Answer: {(p, n) | p.Prime ∧ (n = p ∨ (p = 2 ∧ n = 2) ∨ (p = 2 ∧ n = 4))}
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer: 
   - (p, n) pairs where:
     a) p is prime AND n = p, OR
     b) p = 2 AND n = 4

2. Proposed Answer:
   - (p, n) pairs where:
     a) p is prime AND n = p, OR
     b) p = 2 AND n = 2, OR
     c) p = 2 AND n = 4

The difference is that the proposed answer includes an extra case (p=2, n=2) that's not in the ground truth. Let's test if (2,2) satisfies the original condition:
- p=2 (prime), n=2 (positive)
- Check (2² + 1) % (2² + 1) = 5 % 5 = 0 → satisfies the condition
Therefore, (2,2) should be included in the solution, but it's missing from the ground truth.

The proposed answer is actually more complete than the ground truth, as it includes all valid pairs. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
