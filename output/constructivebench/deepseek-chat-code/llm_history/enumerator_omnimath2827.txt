This problem involves finding a rational number `omnimath2827_answer` such that the equation `1/9 + 1/18 = 1/omnimath2827_answer` holds. The solution can be found by solving the equation for `omnimath2827_answer`.

We'll compute the left-hand side sum and then take its reciprocal to find the answer. The program will compute this directly without enumeration since it's a straightforward algebraic solution.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Compute 1/9 + 1/18
sum_inverse = Fraction(1, 9) + Fraction(1, 18)
# The answer is the reciprocal of the sum
answer = Fraction(1) / sum_inverse
print(answer)
```
