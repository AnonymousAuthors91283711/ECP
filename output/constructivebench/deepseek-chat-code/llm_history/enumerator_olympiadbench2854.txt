This problem involves solving a trigonometric equation to find the value of x² where 6*arctan(x) + 4*arctan(3x) = π. We'll approach it by:

1. Testing rational values for x that might satisfy the equation
2. Using numerical approximation to find potential solutions
3. Verifying exact values when possible

The program will test candidate x values and print those that approximately satisfy the equation, along with their x² values.

```python
import math

def test_x(x):
    lhs = 6 * math.atan(x) + 4 * math.atan(3 * x)
    return abs(lhs - math.pi) < 1e-6

# Test rational candidates and small decimal values
candidates = [i/10 for i in range(1, 20)] + [1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4]

print("Testing candidates that satisfy 6*arctan(x) + 4*arctan(3x) ≈ π:")
for x in candidates:
    if test_x(x):
        print(f"x = {x}, x² = {x*x}")
        
# Refine search around promising values
print("\nRefined search around x ≈ 0.5:")
for i in range(450, 550):
    x = i/1000
    if test_x(x):
        print(f"x = {x}, x² = {x*x}")
```

The program first tests simple rational values, then performs a more refined search around the most promising region (x ≈ 0.5). The output shows both the x value and its square when the equation is approximately satisfied. The exact value can be conjectured from these approximations.
