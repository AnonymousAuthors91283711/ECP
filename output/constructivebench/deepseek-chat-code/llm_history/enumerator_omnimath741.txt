[write_program]
This problem involves counting numbers n between 1 and 2024 that satisfy two gcd conditions. We'll write a Python program to enumerate and count these numbers, then compute the ratio as specified.

The approach:
1. Iterate through numbers 1 to 2024
2. For each n, check both gcd conditions
3. Count how many numbers satisfy both conditions
4. Compute the ratio count/2024

We'll use Python's built-in math.gcd function for efficiency.

```python
import math

def main():
    count = 0
    for n in range(1, 2025):
        gcd1 = math.gcd(99 + n, 99 * n + 1)
        gcd2 = math.gcd(101 + n, 101 * n + 1)
        if gcd1 == 1 and gcd2 == 1:
            count += 1
            print(f"Found valid n: {n}")  # Stream partial results
    
    ratio = count / 2024
    print(f"\nFinal count: {count}")
    print(f"Ratio: {ratio}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
