[write_program]
This problem involves solving two simple linear equations and summing their solutions. We'll write a Python program that:
1. Solves the equations 3 + x = 5 and -3 + y = 5
2. Computes x + y
3. Outputs the exact value (which should be obvious from the equations)

The solution is straightforward since both equations can be solved directly. We'll output the exact value of x + y.

```python
# Solve the equations 3 + x = 5 and -3 + y = 5, then compute x + y
x = 5 - 3
y = 5 - (-3)
result = x + y
print(result)
```
