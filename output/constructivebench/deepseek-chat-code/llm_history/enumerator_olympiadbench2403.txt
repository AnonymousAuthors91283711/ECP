[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that the quadratic polynomial f(n) = x² + (2n-1)x + (n²-22) has no real roots. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal n by checking when the discriminant is negative.

The discriminant D of a quadratic ax²+bx+c is D = b²-4ac. For no real roots, we need D < 0. For our polynomial:
D = (2n-1)² - 4(1)(n²-22) = (4n²-4n+1) - (4n²-88) = -4n + 89

So we need -4n + 89 < 0 ⇒ n > 89/4 ⇒ n > 22.25 ⇒ n ≥ 23

We'll verify this by checking n from 1 upwards until we find the smallest n where D < 0.

```python
def find_min_n():
    for n in range(1, 30):  # Check up to n=29 to be safe
        discriminant = -4 * n + 89
        print(f"n={n}, discriminant={discriminant}")
        if discriminant < 0:
            print(f"Smallest n with no real roots: {n}")
            return

find_min_n()
```
