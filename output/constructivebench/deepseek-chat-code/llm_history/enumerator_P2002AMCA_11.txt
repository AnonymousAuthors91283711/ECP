This problem involves finding the speed `v` that satisfies a system of equations related to distance, time, and speed. We'll translate the mathematical conditions into Python code to enumerate possible values of `v` that satisfy the equations.

The problem can be interpreted as:
1. A distance `d` is traveled at speed 40 mph taking `t + 3/60` hours
2. The same distance `d` is traveled at speed 60 mph taking `t - 3/60` hours
3. We need to find speed `v` that would take exactly `t` hours to cover distance `d`

We'll solve the first two equations to find `d` and `t`, then compute `v = d/t`.

```python
def enumerate_speeds():
    # We'll work with exact fractions to avoid floating point inaccuracies
    from fractions import Fraction
    
    # The equations are:
    # d/40 = t + 3/60
    # d/60 = t - 3/60
    # We can solve for t and d
    
    # Let's represent 3/60 as 1/20
    offset = Fraction(1, 20)
    
    # From first equation: d = 40(t + offset)
    # From second equation: d = 60(t - offset)
    # Set them equal: 40(t + offset) = 60(t - offset)
    # 40t + 40*offset = 60t - 60*offset
    # 100*offset = 20t
    # t = 5*offset = 5*(1/20) = 1/4
    
    t = Fraction(5) * offset
    d = 40 * (t + offset)
    
    # Now v = d/t
    v = d / t
    
    print(f"Found exact solution: v = {v} ({float(v):.2f} mph)")
