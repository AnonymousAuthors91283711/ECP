    (mathodyssey129_answer n) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 
Analyzing n=3
Final minimal distinct heard values for n=3: inf

Analyzing n=4
Final minimal distinct heard values for n=4: inf

Analyzing n=5
Final minimal distinct heard values for n=5: inf

Analyzing n=6
Final minimal distinct heard values for n=6: inf. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
From the enumerated answers, we observe that for all n ≥ 3, the minimal number of distinct heard values is always infinity. This suggests that no matter how we configure the friendship graph and numbers, we can always create infinitely many distinct heard values. 

<<<fun _ : ℕ => 0>>> 

Note: The actual minimal cardinality is infinite, but since the return type is ℕ, we return 0 to represent this (as Lean's ℕ can't represent infinity). The theorem would need to be modified to properly handle this case.
