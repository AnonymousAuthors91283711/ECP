This problem involves finding the values of B (price of bananas), J (price of juice), and N (number of items) that satisfy the given cost equation. The goal is to enumerate possible integer solutions and verify the equation.

We'll:
1. Iterate through possible values of N (since N > 1)
2. For each N, iterate through possible B and J values
3. Check if the equation (4B*N + 5J*N)/100 = 253/100 holds
4. Print valid (B, J, N) tuples that satisfy the equation

```python
def find_solutions():
    # We'll limit N to a reasonable range since larger N would make B and J too small
    for N in range(2, 100):
        # The equation simplifies to: 4B + 5J = 253/N
        total = 253 / N
        if not total.is_integer():
            continue
        
        total_int = int(total)
        # Now find B and J such that 4B + 5J = total_int
        for B in range(1, total_int//4 + 1):
            remaining = total_int - 4*B
            if remaining <= 0:
                continue
            if remaining % 5 == 0:
                J = remaining // 5
                if J > 0:
                    print(f"Found solution: B={B}, J={J}, N={N}")
                    # Verify the solution
                    assert (4*B*N + 5*J*N) == 253
                    print("Verification passed")
