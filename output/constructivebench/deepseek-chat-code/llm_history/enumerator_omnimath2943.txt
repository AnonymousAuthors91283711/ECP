The problem asks for the number of times 3.72 appears in a sequence of 7 numbers, each being either 3.71 or 3.72, such that their sum is exactly 26. We'll enumerate all possible combinations to find the valid count.

```python
def solve():
    target = 26.0
    values = [3.71, 3.72]
    n = 7
    for count_372 in range(n + 1):
        count_371 = n - count_372
        total = count_371 * 3.71 + count_372 * 3.72
        if abs(total - target) < 1e-9:  # account for floating point precision
            print(count_372)
            return  # stop after finding the first valid solution (there's only one)

solve()
```
