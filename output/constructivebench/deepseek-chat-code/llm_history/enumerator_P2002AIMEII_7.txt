[write_program]
The problem asks for the smallest positive integer k such that the sum of squares from 1² to k² is divisible by 200. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal k by computing partial sums and checking divisibility.

```python
def find_min_k():
    # Compute sum of squares modulo 200 incrementally
    total = 0
    for k in range(1, 1000):  # Reasonable upper bound
        total = (total + k * k) % 200
        if total == 0:
            print(f"Found candidate: {k}")
            return k  # Return first (smallest) solution found
    print("No solution found below threshold")
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_k()
```
