This problem involves finding the maximum number of cars (M) that can pass a point in one hour given certain constraints about car length, minimum gap between cars based on speed, and time gap calculations. We'll enumerate possible speeds (v) and compute M for each, tracking the maximum M found.

```python
import math

def compute_max_cars():
    max_M = 0
    # We'll test speeds from 1 to 200 km/h in 0.1 increments
    # (realistically, highway speeds are in this range)
    for v in range(10, 2000, 1):  # v*0.1 km/h
        v_real = v * 0.1
        if v_real <= 0:
            continue
        
        car_length = 4  # meters
        min_gap = car_length * math.ceil(v_real / 15)
        time_gap = (car_length + min_gap) / v_real  # seconds
        
        if time_gap == 0:
            continue  # avoid division by zero
        
        M = math.floor(3600 / time_gap)
        
        if M > max_M:
            max_M = M
            print(f"New max M={M} at v={v_real:.1f} km/h")
    
    print(f"Final maximum number of cars: {max_M}")

compute_max_cars()
