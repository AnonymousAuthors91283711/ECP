[write_program]
This problem involves finding the domain and range of a function g(x) = 1 - f(x+1), where f has a specific domain-range relationship. We'll write a Python program to explore possible answers by testing different intervals for the domain and range.

The program will:
1. Test candidate intervals for the domain of g (P2008AMCA_12_answer.1)
2. For each domain candidate, compute the corresponding range of g
3. Compare with possible range candidates (P2008AMCA_12_answer.2)
4. Output plausible pairs that satisfy the conditions

```python
def main():
    # Test candidate intervals for domain of g (P2008AMCA_12_answer.1)
    # Based on condition: x ∈ domain ↔ x+1 ∈ [0,2]
    # So domain should be [-1,1] since x+1 ∈ [0,2] ↔ x ∈ [-1,1]
    domain_candidate = (-1.0, 1.0)
    
    # For range of g (P2008AMCA_12_answer.2), since f(x+1) ∈ [0,1] when x ∈ [-1,1]
    # g(x) = 1 - f(x+1) ∈ [0,1]
    range_candidate = (0.0, 1.0)
    
    # Verify the domain condition
    test_points = [-2, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 2]
    print("Testing domain condition:")
    for x in test_points:
        in_domain = domain_candidate[0] <= x <= domain_candidate[1]
        x_plus_1_in_02 = 0 <= x + 1 <= 2
        print(f"x={x}: in_domain={in_domain}, x+1∈[0,2]={x_plus_1_in_02}")
    
    # Verify the range condition
    print("\nTesting range condition:")
    # Since f(x+1) can be any value in [0,1], g(x) ranges from 1-1=0 to 1-0=1
    print(f"Range of g: {range_candidate}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
