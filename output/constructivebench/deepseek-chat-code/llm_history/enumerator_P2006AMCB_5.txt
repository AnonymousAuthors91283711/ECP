[write_program]
The problem asks to find the smallest non-negative real number t such that 5*(t/60) - 3*(t/60) = 1. This simplifies to (5-3)*(t/60) = 1 => 2*(t/60) = 1 => t/60 = 1/2 => t = 30. 

We'll write a Python program that:
1. Solves the equation symbolically to find t=30
2. Verifies this is indeed the minimal solution by checking values around it
3. Outputs the minimal solution found

```python
def solve_problem():
    # Solve the equation 5*(t/60) - 3*(t/60) = 1
    # Simplifies to 2*(t/60) = 1 => t = 30
    t = 30.0
    
    # Verify it's indeed the minimal solution
    # Check values around t to confirm minimality
    epsilon = 1e-6
    for delta in [-1, 0, 1]:
        test_t = t + delta
        if test_t >= 0:
            lhs = 5 * (test_t / 60) - 3 * (test_t / 60)
            print(f"Testing t={test_t}: equation evaluates to {lhs}")
    
    # Output the minimal solution
    print(f"\nMinimal solution found: t = {t}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_problem()
