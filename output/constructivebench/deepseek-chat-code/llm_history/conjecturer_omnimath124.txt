Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℤ × ℤ → ℤ
Looking at the enumerated answers, we can observe that when m = -1000, the output k follows the pattern 1000000 + n^2. For example:
- When n = -10, k = 1000100 = 1000000 + (-10)^2
- When n = 20, k = 1000400 = 1000000 + 20^2
- When n = 100, k = 1010000 = 1000000 + 100^2

This suggests the function is likely of the form k = (1000)^2 + n^2 = 1000000 + n^2. The constant 1000 comes from the problem's a=2001 and the m=-1000 pattern in the examples.
