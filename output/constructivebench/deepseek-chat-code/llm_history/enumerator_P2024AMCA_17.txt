[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of three equations with three variables (a, b, c). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible integer solutions within a reasonable range and check which combinations satisfy all three equations. The program will output any valid solutions found.

```python
def solve_equations():
    # We'll search within a reasonable range of integers
    search_range = range(-100, 101)
    
    found_solutions = []
    
    for a in search_range:
        for b in search_range:
            # From first equation: c = 100 - a*b
            c = 100 - a * b
            # Check if this (a,b,c) satisfies the other two equations
            if b * c + a == 87 and c * a + b == 60:
                found_solutions.append((a, b, c))
                print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
                print(f"a*b + b*c + c*a = {a*b + b*c + c*a}")
    
    if found_solutions:
        print("\nAll solutions found:")
        for sol in found_solutions:
            a, b, c = sol
            print(f"({a}, {b}, {c}) with a*b + b*c + c*a = {a*b + b*c + c*a}")
    else:
        print("No integer solutions found in the search range")
