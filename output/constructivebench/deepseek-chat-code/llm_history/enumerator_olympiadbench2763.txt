[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n where the product of digits of n+23 equals the product of digits of n plus 23. We'll write a Python program to search for such numbers by checking consecutive integers and comparing their digit products.

The approach:
1. Define a function to calculate product of digits
2. Iterate through positive integers n
3. For each n, check if P(n+23) = P(n) + 23
4. Stop when we find the smallest such n

```python
def product_of_digits(n):
    product = 1
    for digit in str(n):
        product *= int(digit)
    return product

def find_min_n():
    n = 1
    while True:
        p_n = product_of_digits(n)
        p_n23 = product_of_digits(n + 23)
        if p_n23 == p_n + 23:
            print(f"Found candidate: {n}")
            return n
        n += 1
        # Prevent infinite loop in case no solution exists (though problem implies one does)
        if n > 1000000:
            print("No solution found below 1,000,000")
            return None

find_min_n()
```
