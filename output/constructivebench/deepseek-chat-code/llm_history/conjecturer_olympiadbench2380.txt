Based on the enumerated answers and the error message, I notice that:
1. The final sum's reciprocal (1/14.335587...) is approximately equal to sin(4°)
2. The angle pattern suggests the answer should be 4 degrees in radians
3. The error indicates we need to make the definition noncomputable and use Real.pi

The correct answer should be 4 degrees converted to radians (π/45), but we need to properly handle the Real.pi and noncomputable aspects.

<<<noncomputable abbrev olympiadbench2380_answer : ℝ := Real.pi / 45>>>

Explanation:
1. The enumerated terms show the final sum's reciprocal matches sin(4°)
2. 4 degrees in radians is π/45 (since 180° = π radians)
3. The noncomputable annotation is needed because Real.sin and Real.pi are noncomputable in Lean
4. Using Real.pi instead of π ensures proper type resolution[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

From the enumerated answers, we can observe that the final sum of the series is approximately equal to 1/sin(4°). Converting 4° to radians gives us π/45, which matches the pattern we're seeing in the data. The initial proposed answer of π/45 was correct in value but needed to be marked as noncomputable due to its dependence on Real trigonometric functions.

Here's the corrected answer with the noncomputable annotation:

<<<noncomputable abbrev olympiadbench2380_answer : ℝ := Real.pi / 45>>>

Explanation:
1. The enumerated terms show the sum converges to approximately 14.3356
2. Taking 1/14.3356 ≈ 0.069756 ≈ sin(4°)
3. Therefore, the answer should be the angle whose sine equals 1/S, which is 4° in radians (π/45)
4. The noncomputable annotation is needed because Real trigonometric functions are involved
5. This matches the pattern where each term in the sum has angle doubling (8°, 16°, 32°, etc.) but the final result simplifies to a base angle of 4°[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
