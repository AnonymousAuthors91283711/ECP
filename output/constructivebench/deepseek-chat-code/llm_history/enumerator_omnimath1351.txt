The problem asks for the sum of the absolute values of the distinct real roots of the polynomial P(X) = X^4 - 4X^3 - 4X^2 + 16X - 8. We'll write a Python program to find the roots numerically and compute the sum of their absolute values.

```python
import numpy as np

# Coefficients of the polynomial P(X) = X^4 - 4X^3 - 4X^2 + 16X - 8
coefficients = [1, -4, -4, 16, -8]

# Find all roots (real and complex)
roots = np.roots(coefficients)

# Filter real roots (with some tolerance for numerical precision)
real_roots = [r.real for r in roots if abs(r.imag) < 1e-10]

# Get distinct real roots (rounded to 6 decimal places to handle numerical duplicates)
distinct_real_roots = list(set(round(r, 6) for r in real_roots))

# Compute sum of absolute values of distinct real roots
sum_abs_roots = sum(abs(r) for r in distinct_real_roots)

# Print each distinct root and the final sum
print("Distinct real roots found:")
for root in distinct_real_roots:
    print(f"  {root:.6f}")

print(f"\nSum of absolute values of distinct real roots: {sum_abs_roots:.6f}")
```
