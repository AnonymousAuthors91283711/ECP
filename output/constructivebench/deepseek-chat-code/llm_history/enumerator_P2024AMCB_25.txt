This problem involves calculating a fraction representing the ratio of independent configurations to total configurations for n=6, with colorChoices=2 and patternChoices=2. The fraction must be in simplest form (coprime numerator and denominator). We'll compute this directly.

```python
import math

def main():
    n = 6
    color_choices = 2
    pattern_choices = 2
    
    total_configurations = (color_choices * pattern_choices) ** n
    independent_configurations = (color_choices * pattern_choices * (color_choices + pattern_choices - 1)) ** n
    
    numerator = independent_configurations
    denominator = total_configurations
    
    # Simplify the fraction
    gcd_val = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)
    simplified_num = numerator // gcd_val
    simplified_den = denominator // gcd_val
    
    print(f"Simplified fraction: {simplified_num}/{simplified_den}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
