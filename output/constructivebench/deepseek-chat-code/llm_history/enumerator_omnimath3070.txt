This problem involves finding integer solutions to the equation m + 1 = (n - 2)/3 and then computing 3m - n. We'll enumerate possible integer values for n and compute corresponding m values, checking for integer solutions.

The approach is:
1. Iterate n over a reasonable range of integers
2. For each n, compute m = (n-2)/3 - 1
3. Check if m is integer
4. If valid, compute and print 3m - n

We'll use a small range (-20 to 20) for demonstration, which should be sufficient to spot the pattern.

```python
def main():
    print("Enumerating solutions for 3m - n where m + 1 = (n - 2)/3:")
    print("n\tm\t3m - n")
    for n in range(-20, 21):
        numerator = n - 2
        if numerator % 3 == 0:
            m = (numerator // 3) - 1
            result = 3 * m - n
            print(f"{n}\t{m}\t{result}")
    
    print("\nFrom the pattern, the constant value appears to be:")
    # The output consistently shows the same value for all valid (n,m) pairs
    print(-5)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
