[write_program]
This problem involves counting the number of paths from (0,0) to (5,5) on a grid with specific movement constraints. The paths must:
1. Consist of 10 moves (right, up, or diagonal)
2. Never form a right angle (two consecutive moves that turn 90 degrees)
3. Start at (0,0) and end at (5,5)

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all valid paths using backtracking, counting those that meet the criteria.

```python
def count_paths():
    # Directions: right (1,0), up (0,1), diagonal (1,1)
    directions = [(1,0), (0,1), (1,1)]
    count = 0
    
    def backtrack(path):
        nonlocal count
        x, y = path[-1]
        
        # Reached destination
        if x == 5 and y == 5:
            if len(path) == 11:  # 10 moves (11 points)
                count += 1
                print(f"Found path #{count}")
            return
        
        # Check if we've exceeded grid bounds
        if x > 5 or y > 5:
            return
        
        # Check if path is too long
        if len(path) >= 11:
            return
        
        # Try all possible moves
        for dx, dy in directions:
            new_x, new_y = x + dx, y + dy
            new_pos = (new_x, new_y)
            
            # Check for right angle turns
            if len(path) >= 2:
                prev_x, prev_y = path[-2]
                # Current move direction
                move1 = (x - prev_x, y - prev_y)
                # Proposed move direction
                move2 = (new_x - x, new_y - y)
                # Check if they form right angle (dot product zero and not same direction)
                if move1[0]*move2[0] + move1[1]*move2[1] == 0 and move1 != move2:
                    continue
            
            backtrack(path + [new_pos])
    
    backtrack([(0,0)])
    print(f"Total valid paths: {count}")

count_paths()
```
