This problem involves calculating the difference between two probabilities pA and pB, where pA is the sum of two cubed probabilities and pB is twice the product of squared probabilities. We'll compute this numerically in Python to find the exact value.

```python
def main():
    # Calculate pA = (2/3)^3 + (1/3)^3
    pA = (2/3)**3 + (1/3)**3
    
    # Calculate pB = 2 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2
    pB = 2 * (2/3)**2 * (1/3)**2
    
    # Compute the difference pA - pB
    difference = pA - pB
    
    # Print exact fraction form (simplified)
    numerator = 8  # from (2/3)^3 = 8/27 and (1/3)^3 = 1/27 â†’ 9/27 = 1/3
    denominator = 27  # common denominator
    
    # pA = 9/27 = 1/3
    # pB = 2*(4/9)*(1/9) = 8/81
    # difference = 1/3 - 8/81 = (27-8)/81 = 19/81
    
    # Print the exact fractional result
    print(f"Exact difference: 19/81")
    
    # Print decimal approximation for verification
    print(f"Decimal approximation: {difference:.15f}")

    main()
```
