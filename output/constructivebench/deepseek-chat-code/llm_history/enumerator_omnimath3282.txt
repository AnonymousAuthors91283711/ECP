[write_program]
This problem asks for the maximum number of negative coefficients possible in the square of a real polynomial of degree n (nâ‰¥2). We'll write a program to enumerate small cases and observe patterns.

The approach:
1. Generate all monic polynomials of degree n with coefficients in {-1,0,1} (a reasonable search space)
2. Compute their squares
3. Count negative coefficients in each square
4. Track the maximum count found

```python
import itertools
import numpy as np

def main():
    max_n = 6  # Reasonable upper limit for enumeration
    for n in range(2, max_n + 1):
        max_neg = 0
        # Generate all coefficient combinations (-1,0,1) for degree n
        # (monic polynomial, so leading coefficient is 1)
        for coeffs in itertools.product([-1, 0, 1], repeat=n):
            p = [1] + list(coeffs)  # monic polynomial
            square = np.polymul(p, p)
            neg_count = sum(1 for c in square if c < 0)
            if neg_count > max_neg:
                max_neg = neg_count
                # Print immediately when new maximum found
                print(f"n={n}: new max {max_neg} with coeffs {p}")
        # After checking all, print final maximum for this n
        print(f"n={n}: final maximum is {max_neg}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
