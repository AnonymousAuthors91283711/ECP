This problem involves finding a natural number `olympiadbench2721_answer` such that when added to `tickets` and `arrests`, equals `20 * warnings`. The variables are related through `T`. We'll enumerate possible values of `T` and compute the corresponding answer.

```python
def solve():
    # We'll try T values from 0 to 100 (arbitrary reasonable upper bound)
    for T in range(0, 101):
        warnings = T + 2
        tickets = 20
        arrests = T + 5
        # Solve for olympiadbench2721_answer in the equation:
        # tickets + answer + arrests = 20 * warnings
        answer = 20 * warnings - tickets - arrests
        # Only print if answer is non-negative (natural number)
        if answer >= 0:
            print(f"T={T}, answer={answer}")
    
    # After enumeration, we can observe the pattern:
    # For any T, answer = 20*(T+2) - 20 - (T+5) = 19T + 15
    # So the answer grows linearly with T, with smallest at T=0
    # Therefore the minimal answer is when T=0:
    print("Minimal answer:", 19*0 + 15)

solve()
```
