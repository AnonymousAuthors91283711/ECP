theorem P2022AIMEI_12 :
  let p := S 2022;
  let q := S 2021;
  let d := Nat.gcd p q;
  (p / d + q / d) % 1000 = P2022AIMEI_12_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: S(1) = 1
S(2) = 4
Result for n=2: 5
S(3) = 18
Result for n=3: 11
S(4) = 80
Result for n=4: 49
S(5) = 350
Result for n=5: 43. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the pattern in S(n) values (1,4,18,80,350) and results (5,11,49,43), we can observe that S(n) seems to follow n*(3^(n-1) + 1)/2. The final answer appears to be the last 3 digits of (S(n)+S(n-1))/gcd(S(n),S(n-1))). For n=2022, this simplifies to:

<<<let S := fun n => (n * 3^(n - 1) + 1) / 2; let p := S 2022; let q := S 2021; (p + q) % 1000>>>
