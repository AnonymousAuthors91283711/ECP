[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer m such that any set of m integers between -a and b (inclusive) contains three distinct elements x,y,z with x+y+z=0. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of m for small a and b.

The approach:
1. For given a and b, generate all possible multisets of integers in [-a, b]
2. Check for each m if all size-m subsets contain a valid triple
3. Find the minimal such m

```python
from itertools import combinations

def find_min_m(a, b):
    elements = list(range(-a, b+1))
    for m in range(3, 2*(a+b)+2):  # Upper bound is loose but safe
        all_valid = True
        # Check all m-element subsets
        for subset in combinations(elements, m):
            found = False
            # Check all triples in subset
            for triple in combinations(subset, 3):
                x, y, z = triple
                if x != y and y != z and x != z and x + y + z == 0:
                    found = True
                    break
            if not found:
                all_valid = False
                break
        if all_valid:
            return m
    return None

# Test small values of a and b
for a in range(1, 4):
    for b in range(1, 4):
        min_m = find_min_m(a, b)
        print(f"a={a}, b={b}, min_m={min_m}")
```
