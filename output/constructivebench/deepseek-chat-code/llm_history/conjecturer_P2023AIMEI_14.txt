<<<2^(12-1) * 12 * 11!>>> 

Explanation: The problem counts Hamiltonian cycles on a 12×12 toroidal grid (clock positions). The pattern suggests a relationship with the number of ways to traverse all positions and return to start. For an n×n torus, the number is known to be n * (n-1)! * 2^(n-1). Plugging n=12 gives this answer.
