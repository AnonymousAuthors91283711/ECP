The problem is to find a natural number `k` such that when we subtract `k` from the total of 4, 5, and 7 (which is 16), the equation `2*(4/16) = 4/(16 - k)` holds true, with the constraint that `16 - k > 0`. 

We can solve this by:
1. Calculating the left side: 2*(4/16) = 0.5
2. Setting up the equation 0.5 = 4/(16 - k)
3. Solving for k: (16 - k) = 8 â†’ k = 8

Here's a Python program that verifies this by checking all possible k values from 1 to 15 (since 16 - k must be positive):

```python
def main():
    total = 4 + 5 + 7  # 16
    left_side = 2 * (4 / total)
    
    for k in range(1, total):  # k from 1 to 15
        new_total = total - k
        right_side = 4 / new_total
        if abs(left_side - right_side) < 1e-9:  # floating point comparison tolerance
            print(f"Found solution: k = {k}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program will output the single solution k=8, which satisfies the equation exactly. The floating point comparison uses a small tolerance to account for potential floating-point precision issues.
