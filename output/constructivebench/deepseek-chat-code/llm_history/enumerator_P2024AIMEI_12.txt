The problem asks for the number of real solutions to the equation | |x| - 1/2 | = | |x| - 1/4 |. We can solve this by considering different cases based on the value of |x|. Let's enumerate all possible solutions by analyzing the equation.

The key observation is that the equation involves nested absolute values. We'll first solve for |x|, then consider both positive and negative cases for x. The program will systematically check all possible cases and count the distinct real solutions.

```python
def count_solutions():
    # We'll solve | |x| - 1/2 | = | |x| - 1/4 |
    # Let y = |x|, then solve |y - 1/2| = |y - 1/4|
    # This gives four possible cases:
    solutions = set()
    
    # Case 1: y - 1/2 = y - 1/4 → -1/2 = -1/4 → No solution
    # Case 2: y - 1/2 = -(y - 1/4) → 2y = 3/4 → y = 3/8
    y1 = 3/8
    solutions.add(y1)
    solutions.add(-y1)
    
    # Case 3: -(y - 1/2) = y - 1/4 → -2y = -3/4 → y = 3/8 (same as above)
    # Case 4: -(y - 1/2) = -(y - 1/4) → same as case 1
    
    # Now for each y solution, x can be ±y (except y=0 which would give x=0 only)
    # So for y = 3/8, we get x = 3/8 and x = -3/8
    # Total distinct solutions: 2
    
    print("Found solutions:", sorted(solutions))
    print("Total number of real solutions:", len(solutions))

count_solutions()
```
