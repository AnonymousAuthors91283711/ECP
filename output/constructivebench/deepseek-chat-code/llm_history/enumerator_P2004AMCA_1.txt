The problem asks for the unique natural number `n` that equals the floor of `20 * 100 * 1.45 / 100`. We'll compute this value exactly in Python by performing the calculation and taking the floor of the result.

```python
import math

# Calculate 20 * 100 * 1.45 / 100
result = 20 * 100 * 1.45 / 100
# Take the floor of the result
n = math.floor(result)
# Output the unique answer
print(n)
```
