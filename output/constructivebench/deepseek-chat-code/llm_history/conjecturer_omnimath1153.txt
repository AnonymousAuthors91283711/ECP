Looking at the pattern where with 6 problems, the 10th student solved 6, and considering the symmetry in the problem constraints (each of first 9 students solved exactly 4 problems, each problem was solved by exactly 7 students), the general solution appears to be that the 10th student must solve all problems.

. Enumerated Answers: With 6 problems, 10th student solved 6. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the problem statement and constraints:
1. There are 10 students and an unknown number of problems
2. First 9 students each solved exactly 4 problems
3. Each problem was solved by exactly 7 students
4. We need to find how many problems the 10th student solved

The key insight is that we can calculate the total number of problem solutions in two ways:
1. Sum over students: 9 students × 4 problems + 1 student × x problems = 36 + x
2. Sum over problems: p problems × 7 students = 7p

Setting them equal: 36 + x = 7p
We need integer solutions where x ≤ p (since a student can't solve more problems than exist)

From the enumerated answer hint (when p=6, x=6), we can see the pattern holds (36+6=42=7×6). The general solution is x = 7p - 36.

However, since the answer must be a constant (not depending on p), we need to find p such that x is fixed. The only solution where x=p is when p=6, giving x=6.

Thus, the answer is 6.
