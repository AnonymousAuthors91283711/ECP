[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of triples (a,b,c) of natural numbers where a > b > c > 1 and a*b*c divides (a*b-1)*(b*c-1)*(c*a-1). We'll write a program to enumerate all such triples up to a reasonable limit to find the count.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible c values from 2 upwards
2. For each c, iterate b from c+1 upwards
3. For each (c,b), iterate a from b+1 upwards
4. Check the divisibility condition
5. Stop when values grow beyond a reasonable limit (1000 for this problem)
6. Count and print all valid triples found

```python
def find_triples():
    count = 0
    max_limit = 1000  # Reasonable upper bound for enumeration
    for c in range(2, max_limit):
        for b in range(c + 1, max_limit):
            # Early exit if products become too large
            if b * c > 10**6:  # Prevent excessively large computations
                break
            for a in range(b + 1, max_limit):
                abc = a * b * c
                if abc == 0:
                    continue
                numerator = (a * b - 1) * (b * c - 1) * (c * a - 1)
                if numerator % abc == 0:
                    count += 1
                    print(f"Found triple: ({a}, {b}, {c})")
            # Early exit if a grows too large relative to b,c
            if a > 100 * b:  # Heuristic to skip obviously too large values
                break
    print(f"Total number of triples found: {count}")

find_triples()
```
