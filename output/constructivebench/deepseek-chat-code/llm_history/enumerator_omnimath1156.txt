[write_program]
This problem involves analyzing a recurrence relation for a sequence E(k) and finding constants a and b such that E(n) - a*n - b tends to 0 as n approaches infinity. The recurrence relation is defined with base case E(0) = 0 and recursive case E(k) = 1 + (E(k-1) + E(k-2))/2 for k > 0.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Compute the sequence E(k) numerically
2. Observe its asymptotic behavior
3. Try to conjecture the values of a and b by examining the ratios and differences

```python
def compute_sequence(n):
    E = [0.0] * (n + 1)
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        if k == 1:
            E[k] = 1.0
        else:
            E[k] = 1.0 + (E[k-1] + E[k-2]) / 2
    return E

def analyze_behavior(max_n=50):
    E = compute_sequence(max_n)
    print("n\tE(n)\tE(n)/n\tE(n)-2n/3")
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        ratio = E[n] / n
        diff = E[n] - 2 * n / 3
        print(f"{n}\t{E[n]:.6f}\t{ratio:.6f}\t{diff:.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    analyze_behavior()
```
