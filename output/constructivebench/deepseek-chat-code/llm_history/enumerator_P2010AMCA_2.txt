The problem asks for the greatest natural number n that can be expressed as the sum of 6 consecutive integers. We need to enumerate possible sums of 6 consecutive integers and find the maximum value.

The sum of 6 consecutive integers starting from k is:
k + (k+1) + (k+2) + (k+3) + (k+4) + (k+5) = 6k + 15 = 3(2k + 5)

We'll enumerate sums for increasing k values until the sum becomes negative (which would be invalid for natural numbers). The last positive sum will be our answer.

```python
def find_max_sum():
    max_n = 0
    k = 0
    while True:
        current_sum = 6*k + 15
        if current_sum <= 0:
            break
        print(f"k={k}, sum={current_sum}")  # Show progress
        max_n = current_sum
        k += 1
    print(f"\nMaximum valid sum: {max_n}")

find_max_sum()
```
