[write_program]
This problem asks for the largest constant `a` such that the given inequality holds for all strictly increasing sequences `x` with `x₀=0`. We'll write a Python program to test small values of `n` and sequences `x` to conjecture the optimal `a`.

The approach is:
1. Test small values of n (1, 2, 3)
2. For each n, generate simple strictly increasing sequences
3. Compute both sides of the inequality
4. Find the maximum possible a that satisfies the inequality for all tested cases

```python
import itertools

def test_sequences(n_max=3):
    max_a = float('inf')
    
    for n in range(1, n_max+1):
        # Generate strictly increasing sequences starting with 0
        # We'll use integer differences for simplicity
        for diffs in itertools.product(range(1, 4), repeat=n):
            x = [0]
            for d in diffs:
                x.append(x[-1] + d)
            
            # Compute left sum (1/(x_{i+1}-x_i))
            left_sum = sum(1/(x[i+1]-x[i]) for i in range(n))
            
            # Compute right sum ((i+2)/x_{i+1})
            right_sum = sum((i+2)/x[i+1] for i in range(n))
            
            if right_sum == 0:
                continue
                
            current_a = left_sum / right_sum
            max_a = min(max_a, current_a)
            
            print(f"n={n}, x={x}, a≤{current_a:.6f}")
    
    print(f"\nMaximum possible a: {max_a:.6f}")

test_sequences()
```
