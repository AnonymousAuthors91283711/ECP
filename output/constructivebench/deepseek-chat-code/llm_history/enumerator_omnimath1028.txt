[write_program]
This problem asks for the count of numbers `n` between 2 and 2016 inclusive such that for all prime numbers `p` less than 8 (i.e., 2, 3, 5, 7), `p` divides `n^n - 1`. 

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Check each number from 2 to 2016
2. For each number, verify if all primes 2,3,5,7 divide n^n - 1
3. Count and print qualifying numbers

The program will use modular exponentiation for efficiency when checking divisibility.

```python
def main():
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]
    count = 0
    
    for n in range(2, 2017):
        satisfies = True
        for p in primes:
            # Compute n^n mod p using pow for efficiency
            # Note: n^n mod p = (n mod p)^n mod p, but since n can be large, we use pow(n, n, p)
            # Also, when p divides n, n^n mod p = 0, so n^n - 1 mod p = p-1 â‰  0
            if n % p == 0:
                satisfies = False
                break
            # Compute n^n mod p = n^(n mod (p-1)) mod p by Fermat's little theorem
            exponent = n % (p-1) if p > 2 else 1  # For p=2, n^1 mod 2 = n mod 2
            if pow(n, exponent, p) != 1:
                satisfies = False
                break
        if satisfies:
            count += 1
            print(f"Found valid n: {n} (total so far: {count})")
    
    print(f"Final count: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
