[write_program]
This problem asks for the count of numbers n between 1 and 999 where n equals 6 times the sum of its digits. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such numbers and count them.

The approach:
1. Iterate through numbers 1 to 999
2. For each number, calculate the sum of its digits
3. Check if the number equals 6 times this sum
4. Count all numbers satisfying this condition

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

count = 0
for n in range(1, 1000):
    if n == 6 * digit_sum(n):
        print(n)  # Print each valid number found
        count += 1

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
