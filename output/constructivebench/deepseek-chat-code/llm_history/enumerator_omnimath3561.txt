[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest integer k ≥ 2 such that for any subset P of {2,...,k} that is not equal to {2,...,k} but whose union with {2,...,k} equals {2,...,k}, there exist three elements a,b,c in P with a*b = c.

We'll write a Python program to check this property for increasing values of k, stopping when we find the smallest k that satisfies the condition. For each k, we'll test all possible subsets P that meet the criteria.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_valid(k, P):
    # Check if P contains a,b,c with a*b = c
    for a in P:
        for b in P:
            c = a * b
            if c in P:
                return True
    return False

def check_k(k):
    # Generate all subsets P of [2..k] where P ∪ [2..k] = [2..k] and P ≠ [2..k]
    full_set = set(range(2, k+1))
    for size in range(1, k-1):  # P must be non-empty and not full set
        for P in combinations(range(2, k+1), size):
            P_set = set(P)
            if P_set.union(full_set) == full_set:  # Always true since P ⊆ full_set
                if not is_valid(k, P_set):
                    return False
    return True

def find_min_k():
    k = 2
    while True:
        print(f"Checking k = {k}")
        if check_k(k):
            print(f"Found minimal k: {k}")
            return
        k += 1
        if k > 10:  # Safety limit to prevent infinite loops
            print("Reached safety limit without finding solution")
            return

find_min_k()
```
