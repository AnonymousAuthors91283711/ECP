This problem is a simple equation solving task where we need to find the value of x that makes the equation true. The equation is: 3 - 5 + 7 = 6 - x. We'll solve it step by step and verify the solution.

```python
# Solving the equation 3 - 5 + 7 = 6 - x
left_side = 3 - 5 + 7
right_side = 6

# The equation simplifies to left_side = right_side - x
# So x = right_side - left_side
x = right_side - left_side

# Print the solution
print(f"x = {x}")
```
