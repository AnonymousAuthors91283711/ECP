[write_program]
This problem asks for the greatest natural number n such that there exists a positive integer k where n equals the 2-adic valuation of 10^(k+2) + 64. The 2-adic valuation is the highest power of 2 dividing the number.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Compute the 2-adic valuation for various k values
2. Track the maximum valuation found
3. Output results as we find them
4. Finally output the maximum found

```python
def padic_val_2(n):
    """Compute the 2-adic valuation of n (highest power of 2 dividing n)"""
    val = 0
    while n % 2 == 0:
        val += 1
        n //= 2
    return val

max_val = 0
max_k = 0
print("k\tvaluation")
print("----------------")

# We'll check up to k=20 since valuations stabilize or decrease after a certain point
for k in range(1, 21):
    num = 10 ** (k + 2) + 64
    val = padic_val_2(num)
    print(f"{k}\t{val}")
    if val > max_val:
        max_val = val
        max_k = k

print(f"\nMaximum valuation found: {max_val} (at k={max_k})")
```
