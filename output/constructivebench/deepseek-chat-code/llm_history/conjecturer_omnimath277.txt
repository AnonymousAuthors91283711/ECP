Looking at the pattern in the enumerated answers, we can observe that:
1. For odd n, the result is 1
2. For even n, the result is (n/2)/(n/2 + 1)

This suggests a piecewise definition based on parity. The answer can be expressed as:

<<<fun n : ℕ => if n % 2 = 1 then 1 else (n / 2 : ℝ) / (n / 2 + 1)>>>
