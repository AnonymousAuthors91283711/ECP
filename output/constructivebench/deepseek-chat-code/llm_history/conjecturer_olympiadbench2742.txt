Based on the problem statement and the fact that no valid pairs were found in enumeration, the most likely answer is that the sum is zero since there are no polynomials satisfying the given conditions. The problem involves finding pairs of polynomials (A,B) that satisfy a specific functional equation, but the enumeration suggests no such pairs exist.
