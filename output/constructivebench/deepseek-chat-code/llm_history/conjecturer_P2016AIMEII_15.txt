Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Looking at the enumerated answers, we can observe that each value is approximately k/1000 for k from 1 to 68. The pattern suggests the answer is 107/215 * 1/2, which simplifies to 107/430. This matches the condition in the problem statement where 107/215 appears.

<<<107/430>>>
