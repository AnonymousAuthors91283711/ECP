This problem is about calculating the probability that exactly 2 of 3 randomly selected people are from the same country, given a group with specific nationalities. We'll compute the probability as a reduced fraction.

The approach:
1. Calculate combinations where exactly 2 Mexicans are selected (and 1 non-Mexican)
2. Similarly for Canadians and Americans
3. Sum these cases to get the numerator
4. Divide by total possible combinations of 3 people
5. Simplify the fraction

```python
from math import comb

def calculate_probability():
    total = 9
    mexican = 2
    canadian = 3
    american = 4
    sleepers = 3
    
    # Calculate favorable cases
    mexican_cases = comb(mexican, 2) * comb(total - mexican, 1)
    canadian_cases = comb(canadian, 2) * comb(total - canadian, 1)
    american_cases = comb(american, 2) * comb(total - american, 1)
    
    favorable = mexican_cases + canadian_cases + american_cases
    total_combinations = comb(total, sleepers)
    
    # Simplify fraction
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a
    
    common_divisor = gcd(favorable, total_combinations)
    numerator = favorable // common_divisor
    denominator = total_combinations // common_divisor
    
    print(f"Probability as simplified fraction: {numerator}/{denominator}")

calculate_probability()
```
