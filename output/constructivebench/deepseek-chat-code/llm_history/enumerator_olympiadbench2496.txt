The problem involves computing the minimum of the 2-adic and 5-adic valuations of a custom sequence at n=14. The sequence is defined recursively with base cases custom_sequence(0)=2 and custom_sequence(1)=5, and each subsequent term is the product of the two preceding terms.

To solve this, we'll:
1. Compute the sequence up to n=14
2. For each term, compute its 2-adic and 5-adic valuations
3. Track the minimum valuation at each step
4. Output the final minimum for n=14

Here's the Python program:

```python
def custom_sequence(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 5
    else:
        a, b = 2, 5  # terms for n=0 and n=1
        for _ in range(2, n+1):
            a, b = b, a * b
        return b

def padic_val(p, n):
    if n == 0:
        return float('inf')
    count = 0
    while n % p == 0:
        count += 1
        n = n // p
    return count

n = 14
term = custom_sequence(n)
val2 = padic_val(2, term)
val5 = padic_val(5, term)
min_val = min(val2, val5)

print(f"Term {n}: {term}")
print(f"2-adic valuation: {val2}")
print(f"5-adic valuation: {val5}")
print(f"Minimum valuation: {min_val}")
```
