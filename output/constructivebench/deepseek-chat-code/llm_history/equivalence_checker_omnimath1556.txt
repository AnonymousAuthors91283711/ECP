Ground Truth Answer: 8/9
Proposed Answer: 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a polynomial P with roots at 1/4, 1/2, 2, and 4, with specific conditions on its evaluations and leading coefficient.

2. The ground truth answer (8/9) is the correct evaluation of P(0) when:
   - The polynomial is constructed as P(x) = a(x-1/4)(x-1/2)(x-2)(x-4)
   - The leading coefficient condition gives a = 1/((1/4)*(1/2)*2*4) = 1/1 = 1
   - The eval 1 condition gives P(1) = (3/4)(1/2)(-1)(-3) = 9/8, but we need P(1)=1, so we must scale by 8/9
   - Therefore P(0) = (8/9)*(-1/4)*(-1/2)*(-2)*(-4) = (8/9)*1 = 8/9

3. The proposed answer (1) doesn't account for the scaling factor needed to satisfy P(1)=1.
