This problem involves finding the maximum possible value of x + y given a set of pairwise sums of four numbers a, b, c, d. The given sums are 189, 320, 287, 234, x, y. We need to enumerate all possible combinations to find the maximum x + y.

The approach is:
1. Generate all possible orderings of the sums (permutations)
2. Assign them to a+b, a+c, etc. while maintaining consistency
3. Solve for a, b, c, d and check validity
4. Track the maximum x + y found

```python
from itertools import permutations

def solve():
    given_sums = {189, 234, 287, 320}
    max_sum = 0
    
    # Try all possible assignments of the given sums to the pairwise sums
    for s1, s2, s3, s4 in permutations(given_sums, 4):
        # Equations:
        # a+b = s1, a+c = s2, a+d = s3, b+c = s4
        # Solve for variables
        a = (s1 + s2 - s4) / 2
        if not a.is_integer():
            continue
        a = int(a)
        b = s1 - a
        c = s2 - a
        d = s3 - a
        
        # Check if all variables are positive and distinct
        if a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c <= 0 or d <= 0:
            continue
        if len({a, b, c, d}) != 4:
            continue
        
        # Calculate remaining sums
        bd = b + d
        cd = c + d
        
        # The two unknown sums are b+d and c+d
        unknown_sums = {bd, cd}
        if len(unknown_sums) != 2:
            continue
        
        # Calculate current x + y
        current_sum = bd + cd
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            print(f"Found new maximum x + y = {current_sum} with sums {unknown_sums}")
    
    print(f"Final maximum x + y: {max_sum}")

solve()
```
