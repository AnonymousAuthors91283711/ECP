Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated solutions, we can observe that all solutions are of the form (1,1,k) where k ranges from 1 to 100. The equation simplifies to 0=0 when a=b=1, making all (1,1,k) valid solutions. Since k can be any value from 1 to 100, there are exactly 100 solutions.
