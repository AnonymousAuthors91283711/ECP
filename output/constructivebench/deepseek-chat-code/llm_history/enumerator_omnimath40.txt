[write_program]
This problem involves finding the maximum possible values for two expressions under given constraints. We'll write a Python program to explore possible values of the sequence `a` that satisfy the constraints and compute the target expressions.

The constraints are:
1. Periodic condition: a[40] = a[0]
2. Sum condition: sum of a[0] to a[39] = 0
3. Bounded difference: |a[i] - a[i+1]| â‰¤ 1 for all i

We'll focus on small cases (n=4,8) first to understand the pattern before tackling n=40.

```python
def main():
    # First explore smaller cases to understand the pattern
    for n in [4, 8, 12]:
        print(f"\nExploring case n={n}:")
        # The maximum sum seems to occur when values alternate between k and -k
        k = n // 4
        a = [(-1)**(i//k) * k for i in range(n)]
        a.append(a[0])  # periodic condition
        print(f"Sequence: {a[:-1]}")
        sum_a = sum(a[:-1])
        print(f"Sum condition satisfied: {sum_a == 0}")
        
        # Check bounded difference condition
        valid = True
        for i in range(n):
            if abs(a[i] - a[(i+1)%n]) > 1:
                valid = False
                break
        print(f"Bounded difference condition satisfied: {valid}")
        
        # Compute target expressions
        i1, i2, i3, i4 = k-1, 2*k-1, 3*k-1, 4*k-1
        sum_expr = a[i1] + a[i2] + a[i3] + a[i4]
        prod_expr = a[i1]*a[i2] + a[i3]*a[i4]
        print(f"Sum expression value: {sum_expr}")
        print(f"Product expression value: {prod_expr}")
    
    # For n=40, the pattern suggests:
    n = 40
    k = n // 4
    max_sum = 4 * k
    max_prod = 2 * k * k
    print(f"\nFor n=40, the conjectured maximum values are:")
    print(f"Maximum sum: {max_sum}")
    print(f"Maximum product sum: {max_prod}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
