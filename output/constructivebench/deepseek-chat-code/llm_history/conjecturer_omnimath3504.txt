abbrev omnimath3504_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3504 (x : ℝ) : 
  x / 2 < x^2 ∧ x^2 < x ↔ x ∈ omnimath3504_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing points around critical values:
x = -1.00: Does not satisfy the condition
x = -0.10: Does not satisfy the condition
x = 0.10: Does not satisfy the condition
x = 0.30: Does not satisfy the condition
x = 0.60: Satisfies the condition
x = 0.90: Satisfies the condition
x = 1.10: Does not satisfy the condition
x = 2.00: Does not satisfy the condition

Sample rational numbers in solution set:
11/20 = 0.55 satisfies the condition
12/20 = 0.60 satisfies the condition
13/20 = 0.65 satisfies the condition
14/20 = 0.70 satisfies the condition
15/20 = 0.75 satisfies the condition
16/20 = 0.80 satisfies the condition
17/20 = 0.85 satisfies the condition
18/20 = 0.90 satisfies the condition
19/20 = 0.95 satisfies the condition

The solution set appears to be all real numbers x where 0.5 < x < 1. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
