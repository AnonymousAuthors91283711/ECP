[write_program]
This problem involves finding the smallest integer n > 1 that satisfies a binomial probability equation. The equation compares two probabilities: getting exactly 2 successes in n trials vs exactly 3 successes, with success probability 1/4.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Enumerate n from 2 upwards
2. For each n, compute both sides of the equation
3. Check when they become equal (within floating point tolerance)
4. Find the smallest such n

```python
import math

def choose(n, k):
    return math.comb(n, k)

def compute_lhs(n):
    return choose(n, 2) * (1/4)**2 * (3/4)**(n-2)

def compute_rhs(n):
    return choose(n, 3) * (1/4)**3 * (3/4)**(n-3)

# Search for the smallest n > 1 where LHS = RHS
for n in range(2, 100):
    lhs = compute_lhs(n)
    rhs = compute_rhs(n)
    # Print candidates that are close (accounting for floating point)
    if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-10:
        print(f"Found candidate: n = {n}")
        print(f"LHS = {lhs}, RHS = {rhs}")
        # Since we're searching in order, first found is smallest
        print(f"Smallest solution found: n = {n}")
        break
```
