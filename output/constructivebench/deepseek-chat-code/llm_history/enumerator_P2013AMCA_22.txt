The problem asks for the fraction of 6-digit palindromic numbers that are divisible by 11 and whose quotient when divided by 11 is also a 6-digit palindromic number. We need to enumerate all 6-digit palindromes, count how many meet the condition, and compute the fraction.

Here's a Python program that:
1. Generates all 6-digit palindromes efficiently
2. Checks which are divisible by 11 and have palindromic quotients
3. Computes the fraction

```python
def is_palindrome(n):
    s = str(n)
    return s == s[::-1]

def generate_6digit_palindromes():
    palindromes = []
    for first_half in range(100, 1000):
        s = str(first_half)
        palindrome = int(s + s[::-1])
        palindromes.append(palindrome)
    return palindromes

def main():
    palindromes = generate_6digit_palindromes()
    total = len(palindromes)
    good = 0
    
    for p in palindromes:
        if p % 11 == 0:
            m = p // 11
            if 100000 <= m <= 999999 and is_palindrome(m):
                good += 1
    
    print(f"Total palindromes: {total}")
    print(f"Good palindromes: {good}")
    print(f"Fraction: {good}/{total} = {good/total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program first generates all 6-digit palindromes by mirroring 3-digit numbers (100-999). Then it checks each palindrome for divisibility by 11 and whether the quotient is also a 6-digit palindrome. Finally, it prints the counts and the resulting fraction.
