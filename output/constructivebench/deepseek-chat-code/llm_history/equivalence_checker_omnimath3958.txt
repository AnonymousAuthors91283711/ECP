theorem omnimath3958 (a b c d : ℝ) :
  (a + b) * (a^2 + b^2) = (c + d) * (c^2 + d^2) ∧
  (a + c) * (a^2 + c^2) = (b + d) * (b^2 + d^2) ∧
  (a + d) * (a^2 + d^2) = (b + c) * (b^2 + c^2) ↔ (a, b, c, d) ∈ omnimath3958_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: { (a, b, c, d) | a = b ∧ b = c ∧ c = d }
Proposed Answer: { (x, x, x, x) | x : ℝ }
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The ground truth answer states that all four variables must be equal (a = b = c = d). The proposed answer expresses the same condition but uses x as the common value for all four variables. Both answers are equivalent as they describe the same set of solutions where all four real numbers are identical. The notation difference is purely syntactic.
