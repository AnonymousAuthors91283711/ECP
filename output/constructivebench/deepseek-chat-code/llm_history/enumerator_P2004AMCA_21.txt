This problem involves finding cos(2θ) given that the infinite series sum of (cosθ)^(2n) equals 5. The series is a geometric series with ratio (cosθ)^2. We'll write a program to verify possible values of θ that satisfy the series condition and compute cos(2θ).

The geometric series sum formula gives us 1/(1 - (cosθ)^2) = 5 when |cosθ| < 1. We'll solve for cosθ, then compute cos(2θ) using the double angle formula.

```python
import math

def find_cos_2theta():
    # Solve 1/(1 - x^2) = 5 where x = cosθ
    # Rearranged to x^2 = 4/5
    x_squared = 4/5
    x = math.sqrt(x_squared)  # We take positive root since cosθ can be positive or negative
    
    # Compute cos(2θ) using double angle formula: cos(2θ) = 2cos²θ - 1
    cos_2theta = 2 * x_squared - 1
    
    print(f"cosθ = ±{x:.5f}")
    print(f"cos(2θ) = {cos_2theta:.5f}")

find_cos_2theta()
