[write_program]
This problem asks to find all pairs of positive integers (a,b) where the gcd of (a^n + b) and (b^n + a) stabilizes to some constant g for all sufficiently large n. We'll write a program to enumerate candidate pairs and check the gcd behavior.

The approach:
1. Iterate through small values of a and b (up to a reasonable limit)
2. For each pair, compute the gcd sequence for increasing n until it stabilizes
3. Output pairs where stabilization occurs

```python
import math
from itertools import product

def find_stable_pairs(max_val=20):
    """Find (a,b) pairs where gcd(a^n + b, b^n + a) stabilizes for large n."""
    for a, b in product(range(1, max_val+1), repeat=2):
        if a == b:
            print(f"Found stable pair: ({a}, {b})")  # gcd will be a+b
            continue
            
        g_prev = None
        stable = True
        # Check stabilization up to n=20 (empirically sufficient for small a,b)
        for n in range(1, 21):
            term1 = a**n + b
            term2 = b**n + a
            current_gcd = math.gcd(term1, term2)
            
            if n > 1 and current_gcd != g_prev:
                stable = False
                break
            g_prev = current_gcd
            
        if stable and g_prev is not None:
            print(f"Found stable pair: ({a}, {b}) with gcd {g_prev}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Searching for stable gcd pairs (a,b) where a,b â‰¤ 20:")
    find_stable_pairs()
```
