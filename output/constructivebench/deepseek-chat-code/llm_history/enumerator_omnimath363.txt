This problem involves finding a closed-form expression for a sum of products of a sequence `a` with specific constraints. The sequence starts with `a(1)=1` and each subsequent term can increase by at most 1 (`a(i+1) ≤ a(i) + 1`). We'll enumerate small cases to identify the pattern.

The approach:
1. Generate all valid sequences `a` of length `n` under the given constraints
2. For each sequence, compute the sum of products
3. Observe the pattern in the results

```python
def generate_sequences(n):
    """Generate all valid sequences of length n starting with 1, with a(i+1) ≤ a(i)+1"""
    if n == 1:
        return [[1]]
    shorter = generate_sequences(n-1)
    sequences = []
    for seq in shorter:
        last = seq[-1]
        for next_val in [last, last + 1]:
            sequences.append(seq + [next_val])
    return sequences

def compute_sum_product(seq):
    """Compute the sum of products for a given sequence"""
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(seq)):
        product = 1
        for j in range(i + 1):
            product *= seq[j]
        total += product
    return total

def main():
    max_n = 6  # Small enough to see patterns, large enough to be meaningful
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        sequences = generate_sequences(n)
        # All sequences should give same sum under constraints
        if sequences:
            first_sum = compute_sum_product(sequences[0])
            all_same = all(compute_sum_product(s) == first_sum for s in sequences)
            print(f"n={n}: sum={first_sum}, all_sequences_match={all_same}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
