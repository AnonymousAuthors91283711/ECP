abbrev omnimath3638_answer : ℕ → ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3638 (n : ℕ) :
  ∑ k in Finset.range (n + 1), (10^k - 1)/9 = omnimath3638_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=0: sum = 0 (exact 0/1)
n=1: sum = 1 (exact 1/1)
n=2: sum = 12 (exact 12/1)
n=3: sum = 123 (exact 123/1)
n=4: sum = 1234 (exact 1234/1)
n=5: sum = 12345 (exact 12345/1)
n=6: sum = 123456 (exact 123456/1)
n=7: sum = 1234567 (exact 1234567/1)
n=8: sum = 12345678 (exact 12345678/1)
n=9: sum = 123456789 (exact 123456789/1)
n=10: sum = 1234567900 (exact 1234567900/1). Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℚ
<<<fun n : ℕ => (10^(n + 1) - 9 * n - 10) / 81>>>
