theorem P2019AIMEII_14 : 
  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ 
    IsGreatest {m : ℕ | ¬∃ (a b c : ℕ), 5*a + n*b + (n+1)*c = m} 91} 
  P2019AIMEII_14_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 24 satisfies condition (largest non-expressible is 91)
n = 47 satisfies condition (largest non-expressible is 91)
Maximum n satisfying the condition: 47. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
