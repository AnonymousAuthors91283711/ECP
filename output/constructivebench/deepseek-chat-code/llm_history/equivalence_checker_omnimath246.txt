Ground Truth Answer: fun m n => ∏ i in Finset.Icc 1 n, (m^2 + m - i^2 + i)
Proposed Answer: fun m n => (2 * n)! * Nat.choose (m + n) (2 * n)
Let me analyze the equivalence of these two expressions.

1. The ground truth answer is a product from i=1 to n of (m² + m - i² + i)
2. The proposed answer is (2n)! * C(m+n, 2n)

First, let's rewrite the ground truth expression:
∏_{i=1}^n (m² + m - i² + i) = ∏_{i=1}^n (m(m+1) - i(i-1)) = ∏_{i=1}^n [(m+i)(m-i+1)]

Now let's expand the proposed answer:
(2n)! * C(m+n, 2n) = (2n)! * (m+n)!/((2n)!(m-n)!) = (m+n)!/(m-n)!

This matches exactly with the left side of the original equation (m+n)!/(m-n)! when m ≥ n.

Therefore, the two expressions are indeed equivalent.
