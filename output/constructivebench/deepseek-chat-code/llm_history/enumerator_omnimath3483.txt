[write_program]
This problem is a simple linear equation where we need to find the unique natural number x that satisfies the equation 2*(x+7)-4 = 28. The solution can be found by solving the equation algebraically, but we'll write a Python program to enumerate possible solutions to demonstrate the approach.

The equation simplifies to:
2*(x+7)-4 = 28
2x + 14 - 4 = 28
2x + 10 = 28
2x = 18
x = 9

But since we're asked to enumerate, we'll write a program that checks natural numbers until it finds the solution.

```python
def solve_equation():
    # We'll check natural numbers up to 100 (arbitrary large enough bound)
    for x in range(1, 101):
        if 2 * (x + 7) - 4 == 28:
            print(f"Found solution: x = {x}")
            return
    print("No solution found in range")

solve_equation()
```
