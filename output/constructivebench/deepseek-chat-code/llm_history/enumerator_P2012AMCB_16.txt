This problem involves counting the number of preference functions from 4 songs to subsets of 3 girls, with specific constraints. We'll enumerate all possible functions and count those satisfying:
1. Each song's preference is a subset of the 3 girls
2. No song is liked by all 3 girls
3. For any two distinct girls, there's at least one song they both like

We'll represent girls as {0,1,2} and songs as {0,1,2,3}. Each function maps songs to subsets of girls.

```python
from itertools import product

def solve():
    girls = {0, 1, 2}
    songs = [0, 1, 2, 3]
    
    # All possible non-empty subsets that aren't the full set (condition 2)
    valid_subsets = [set(subset) for subset in product([0,1], repeat=3) 
                    if any(subset) and not all(subset)]
    
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through all possible functions from songs to valid subsets
    for f in product(valid_subsets, repeat=4):
        # Check condition 3: all pairs covered
        pairs_covered = True
        for g1 in girls:
            for g2 in girls:
                if g1 != g2:
                    found = False
                    for s in songs:
                        if g1 in f[s] and g2 in f[s]:
                            found = True
                            break
                    if not found:
                        pairs_covered = False
                        break
            if not pairs_covered:
                break
        
        if pairs_covered:
            count += 1
            print(f"Found valid function #{count}: {f}")
    
    print(f"Total valid functions: {count}")

solve()
```
