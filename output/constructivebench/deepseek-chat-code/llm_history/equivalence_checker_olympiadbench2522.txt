Ground Truth Answer: 50
Proposed Answer: 90
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a scenario with paddle speed (7) and swim speed (2) over 1.5 hours (90 minutes) total time. It asks to find a time value (olympiadbench2522_answer) that satisfies certain conditions about time allocations t₁ and t₂.

2. The ground truth answer is 50, which would represent 50 minutes (since the theorem states olympiadbench2522_answer/60 = ... and total_time is in hours).

3. The proposed answer is 90, which directly equals the total time in minutes (1.5 hours = 90 minutes).

4. The key equation is: olympiadbench2522_answer/60 = total_time - (t₁ + (total_time - t₂)). For the proposed answer 90, this would imply 1.5 = 1.5 - (t₁ + (1.5 - t₂)), which simplifies to t₁ + (1.5 - t₂) = 0. This would only be possible if t₁ = 0 and t₂ = 1.5, but this contradicts other conditions in the problem (specifically the speed-distance relationships).

5. The ground truth answer 50 leads to a consistent solution where t₁ ≈ 0.3 hours and t₂ ≈ 1.05 hours, satisfying all conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed answer (90) does not satisfy the problem's conditions and is not equivalent to the ground truth answer (50).
