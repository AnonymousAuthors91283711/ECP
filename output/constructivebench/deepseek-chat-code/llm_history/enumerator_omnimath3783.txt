This problem asks for all positive integer pairs (a, b) where:
1. b^619 divides a^1000 + 1
2. a^619 divides b^1000 + 1

We'll search for small pairs (a, b) that satisfy these conditions by checking possible values up to a reasonable threshold. The divisibility conditions suggest that a and b must be closely related, likely equal or with a specific multiplicative relationship.

```python
def compute():
    max_n = 10  # Reasonable upper bound for initial search
    results = []
    
    for a in range(1, max_n + 1):
        for b in range(1, max_n + 1):
            # Compute the required values
            lhs1 = a**1000 + 1
            rhs1 = b**619
            lhs2 = b**1000 + 1
            rhs2 = a**619
            
            # Check divisibility conditions
            if lhs1 % rhs1 == 0 and lhs2 % rhs2 == 0:
                results.append((a, b))
                print(f"Found pair: ({a}, {b})")
    
    print("\nSearch complete. Found pairs:")
    for pair in results:
        print(pair)

compute()
```
