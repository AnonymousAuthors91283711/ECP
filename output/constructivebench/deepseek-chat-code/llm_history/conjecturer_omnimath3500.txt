  (Janice_now Janice_2yearsago Janice_12years : ℕ)
  (hJanice_2yearsago : Janice_2yearsago = Janice_now - 2)
  (hJanice_12years : Janice_12years = Janice_now + 12) :
  Janice_12years = 8 * Janice_2yearsago ↔ Janice_now = omnimath3500_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found solution: Janice's current age is 4
- 2 years ago: 2
- in 12 years: 16
Verification: 8 * 2 = 16 == 16. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
