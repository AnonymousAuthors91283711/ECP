k=2 does not appear to satisfy the condition
k=3 does not appear to satisfy the condition

k=13 does not appear to satisfy the condition
k=14 does not appear to satisfy the condition
k=15 does not appear to satisfy the condition
k=16 does not appear to satisfy the condition
k=17 does not appear to satisfy the condition
k=18 does not appear to satisfy the condition
k=19 does not appear to satisfy the condition
k=20 does not appear to satisfy the condition. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → Prop
Based on the problem statement and the enumerated answers, the condition appears to never be satisfied for any k in the tested range. The problem seems to be about finding when there exists an arithmetic progression where infinitely many terms have a number of divisors divisible by 2018. Since no k up to 20 works, the answer is likely that no such k exists.
