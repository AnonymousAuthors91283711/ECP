[write_program]
This problem appears to be about finding a constant value (omnimath3095_answer) that equals 3 times the number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of 5 elements. The combinatorial expression "players.card.choose 2" is simply the binomial coefficient C(5,2).

The Python program will calculate 3 * C(5,2) and output the result. Since this is a straightforward computation, we don't need enumeration - we can compute it directly.

```python
from math import comb

def main():
    # Calculate 3 * C(5,2)
    result = 3 * comb(5, 2)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
