This problem asks for the maximum value of `s = x + y` where `y = x^2` and `y - x = 3 - y`. We'll solve it by enumerating possible solutions.

Approach:
1. Substitute `y = x^2` into the second equation to get `x^2 - x = 3 - x^2`
2. Rearrange to form a quadratic equation: `2x^2 - x - 3 = 0`
3. Solve for x, then compute y and s for each solution
4. The maximum s will be our answer

```python
import math

def solve():
    # Coefficients of the quadratic equation 2x^2 - x - 3 = 0
    a = 2
    b = -1
    c = -3
    
    # Calculate discriminant
    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
    
    if discriminant < 0:
        print("No real solutions")
        return
    
    # Calculate both roots
    x1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
    x2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
    
    # Calculate corresponding y and s values
    y1 = x1**2
    s1 = x1 + y1
    
    y2 = x2**2
    s2 = x2 + y2
    
    # Print all solutions
    print(f"Solution 1: x = {x1}, y = {y1}, s = {s1}")
    print(f"Solution 2: x = {x2}, y = {y2}, s = {s2}")
    
    # Determine and print the maximum s
    max_s = max(s1, s2)
    print(f"\nMaximum value of s is: {max_s}")
