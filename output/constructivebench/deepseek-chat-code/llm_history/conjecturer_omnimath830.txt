Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumeration pattern, we can see the problem is counting the number of possible lattice structures (sets closed under union and intersection) on a 3-element set. The count reaches 55, which matches known results for distributive lattices on 3 elements.

<<<55>>>
