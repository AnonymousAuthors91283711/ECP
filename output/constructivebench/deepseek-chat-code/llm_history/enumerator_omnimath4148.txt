This problem involves finding the maximum possible difference between consecutive terms in a recursive sequence. The sequence is defined with initial conditions a₀=0, a₁=1, and for n≥2, aₙ is the average of the previous k terms where k can be any integer from 1 to n.

To approach this, we'll:
1. Implement the recursive sequence definition
2. Compute terms up to n=2018
3. Track the differences aₙ - aₙ₋₁
4. Find the maximum difference

We'll use memoization for efficiency and limit our computation to n=20 to observe the pattern (since computing up to 2018 would be too slow in pure Python).

```python
from functools import lru_cache

def main():
    # Memoize the sequence values to avoid redundant computations
    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def a(n):
        if n == 0:
            return 0.0
        if n == 1:
            return 1.0
        max_diff = -float('inf')
        # Try all possible k values from 1 to n
        for k in range(1, n+1):
            start = n - k
            end = n - 1
            if start < 0:
                continue
            total = sum(a(i) for i in range(start, end + 1))
            current = total / k
            # Track the maximum possible a(n) by choosing optimal k
            if current > max_diff:
                max_diff = current
        return max_diff
    
    max_difference = 0.0
    # Compute up to n=20 to observe the pattern
    for n in range(1, 21):
        diff = a(n) - a(n-1)
        print(f"a({n}) - a({n-1}) = {diff}")
        if diff > max_difference:
            max_difference = diff
    
    print(f"\nMaximum difference observed: {max_difference}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
