This problem involves finding the number of pencils (P2009AIMEII_1_answer) that satisfies several constraints relating blue (b), red (r), white (w) pencils and the total number of pencils (p). The constraints include equal differences between initial counts and remaining counts after some pencils are used.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of b, r, w that satisfy the constraints, then compute p and the answer. The key constraints are:
1. 130 - b = 164 - r = 188 - w (let's call this common difference d)
2. p = b + r + w
3. b ≤ 130, r ≤ 164, w ≤ 188
4. p ≤ r + w

```python
def solve():
    # Total initial pencils: 130 (blue) + 164 (red) + 188 (white) = 482
    total_initial = 130 + 164 + 188
    
    # We're looking for d such that:
    # b = 130 - d
    # r = 164 - d
    # w = 188 - d
    # with all >=0 and p = b + r + w <= r + w
    
    # The condition p <= r + w simplifies to b <= 0, but since b >=0, b must be 0
    # So d = 130 (from b = 130 - d = 0)
    
    d = 130
    b = 130 - d
    r = 164 - d
    w = 188 - d
    
    if b >=0 and r >=0 and w >=0:
        p = b + r + w
        answer = total_initial - p
        print(f"Found solution: d={d}, b={b}, r={r}, w={w}, p={p}, answer={answer}")
        print(f"Final answer: {answer}")
    else:
        print("No solution found")

solve()
