[write_program]
This problem asks for the maximum value of N = (h+1)(v+1) where h and v are natural numbers satisfying 5h + 4v = 2007. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible (h,v) pairs and compute N, keeping track of the maximum N found.

The approach is:
1. Express v in terms of h: v = (2007 - 5h)/4
2. Iterate h values where (2007 - 5h) is divisible by 4 and positive
3. For each valid h, compute v and then N
4. Track and output the maximum N found

```python
def find_max_N():
    max_N = 0
    # Iterate possible h values where (2007 - 5h) is divisible by 4
    for h in range(0, (2007 // 5) + 1):
        remainder = 2007 - 5 * h
        if remainder >= 0 and remainder % 4 == 0:
            v = remainder // 4
            N = (h + 1) * (v + 1)
            if N > max_N:
                max_N = N
                print(f"New max N={N} at h={h}, v={v}")
    print(f"Final maximum N: {max_N}")

find_max_N()
```
