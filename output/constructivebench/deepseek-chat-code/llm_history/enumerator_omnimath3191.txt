[write_program]
This problem involves finding all pairs (n, ks) where ks is a list of n positive integers summing to 5n-4, and the sum of their reciprocals equals 1. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible solutions for small n values.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible n values (starting from 1)
2. For each n, generate all possible combinations of n positive integers that sum to 5n-4
3. Check if the sum of reciprocals equals 1
4. Print valid solutions as they're found

```python
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement

def find_solutions(max_n=10):
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        target_sum = 5 * n - 4
        # The minimal element is at least 1, maximal is at most target_sum - (n-1)*1
        min_k = 1
        max_k = target_sum - (n - 1)
        
        # Generate all non-decreasing sequences of n positive integers summing to target_sum
        # Using stars and bars approach would be more efficient, but for small n this works
        for ks in combinations_with_replacement(range(min_k, max_k + 1), n):
            if sum(ks) != target_sum:
                continue
            reciprocal_sum = sum(1/k for k in ks)
            if abs(reciprocal_sum - 1) < 1e-10:  # Account for floating point precision
                print(f"n={n}, ks={ks}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solutions()
```
