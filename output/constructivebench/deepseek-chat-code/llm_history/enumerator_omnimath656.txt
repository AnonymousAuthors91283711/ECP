This problem involves finding the cardinality of the set of real numbers x such that the function f(x) = ∑_{n=0}^∞ x^(2n) equals x. The function is a geometric series that converges when |x| < 1. We'll enumerate possible solutions by:

1. Finding the closed form of the series (1/(1-x²) when |x| < 1)
2. Solving the equation 1/(1-x²) = x
3. Checking boundary cases at x = ±1
4. Counting all real solutions

Here's the Python program to enumerate and count the solutions:

```python
import numpy as np
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, S

def find_solutions():
    x = symbols('x')
    # The series converges to 1/(1-x^2) for |x| < 1
    equation = Eq(1/(1 - x**2), x)
    
    # Find all real solutions
    solutions = solve(equation, x, domain=S.Reals)
    exact_solutions = [sol.evalf() for sol in solutions if sol.is_real]
    
    # Check boundary cases (x = ±1)
    boundary_values = [-1, 1]
    for val in boundary_values:
        # The series diverges at these points, but we check if f(x)=x holds
        # In reality, f(x) is undefined at these points
        pass  # No solutions at boundaries
    
    # Print all found solutions
    print("Exact solutions:")
    for sol in exact_solutions:
        print(sol)
    
    # Count the number of distinct real solutions
    count = len(exact_solutions)
    print(f"\nNumber of solutions: {count}")

find_solutions()
```

The program outputs the exact solutions to the equation and counts them. The geometric series converges only when |x| < 1, and within this interval, we solve 1/(1-x²) = x. The boundary points x = ±1 are not valid solutions since the series diverges there. The output will show the exact solutions and their count.
