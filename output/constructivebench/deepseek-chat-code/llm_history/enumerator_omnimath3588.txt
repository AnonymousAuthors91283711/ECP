[write_program]
The problem asks to find prime numbers of the form p = 3*10^(2+k) + 8*10^(1+k) + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 10^i for some k â‰¥ 1. We need to enumerate these numbers and check for primality.

The expression simplifies to numbers like 3889 (k=1), 38889 (k=2), etc. We'll write a program to:
1. Generate numbers of this form for increasing k values
2. Check each for primality
3. Output primes found

We'll limit k to a reasonable range (say up to 10) since numbers grow exponentially.

```python
import sympy

def generate_number(k):
    """Generate the number for given k"""
    return 3 * 10**(2 + k) + 8 * 10**(1 + k) + sum(10**i for i in range(k))

max_k = 10
print(f"Searching for primes with k from 1 to {max_k}")

for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
    n = generate_number(k)
    if sympy.isprime(n):
        print(f"Found prime for k={k}: {n}")
```
