This problem involves infinite series and their properties. We need to find the sum of two geometric series given a condition on their product. The key is to recognize that both series are geometric and can be expressed in closed form.

1. The first series ∑ a^n = 1/(1-a) for |a| < 1
2. The second series ∑ (-a)^n = 1/(1+a) for |a| < 1
3. Their product is (1/(1-a)) * (1/(1+a)) = 1/(1-a²) = 2016
4. Solving 1/(1-a²) = 2016 gives a² = 2015/2016
5. The required sum is 1/(1-a) + 1/(1+a) = 2/(1-a²) = 2*2016 = 4032

The program will verify this by computing the sum for a = sqrt(2015/2016) and showing it equals 4032.

```python
import math

def main():
    # Compute a^2 from the given equation
    a_squared = 2015 / 2016
    a = math.sqrt(a_squared)
    
    # Compute the two geometric series sums
    sum1 = 1 / (1 - a)  # ∑ a^n
    sum2 = 1 / (1 + a)   # ∑ (-a)^n
    
    # Compute their product (should be 2016) and sum
    product = sum1 * sum2
    total_sum = sum1 + sum2
    
    # Print verification and result
    print(f"Product verification: {product} (should be 2016)")
    print(f"Required sum: {total_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
