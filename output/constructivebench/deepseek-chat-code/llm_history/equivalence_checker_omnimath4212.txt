theorem omnimath4212 (n : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) (x : ℂ) :
    x ^ n - x ^ (n - 2) - x + 2 = 0 ∧ Complex.abs x = 1 ↔ x ∈ omnimath4212_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => if ∃ k, n = 2 + 6 * k then {1 / 2 + (Real.sqrt 3) / 2 * I, 1 / 2 - (Real.sqrt 3) / 2 * I} else ∅
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => {1, -1, I, -I} \ {1}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
- We're looking for complex roots x where |x| = 1 and x satisfies x^n - x^(n-2) - x + 2 = 0
- The condition requires both the equation and |x| = 1 to hold

Ground Truth Answer:
- Only gives non-empty solutions when n = 2 + 6k (i.e., n ≡ 2 mod 6)
- In those cases, gives the primitive 6th roots of unity (excluding 1 and -1)
- This is a precise answer that matches the equation's behavior

Proposed Answer:
- Suggests {1, -1, I, -I} \ {1} = {-1, I, -I} as solution
- Doesn't consider the modulus condition |x| = 1 (though all listed numbers satisfy it)
- Doesn't account for the n-dependence of the solution
- Incorrectly includes -1, I, -I which don't generally satisfy the equation

Evaluation:
- The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the ground truth's conditional nature
- It includes solutions that don't satisfy the equation for most n
- It misses the actual solutions that appear when n ≡ 2 mod 6
