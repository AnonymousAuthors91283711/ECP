This problem asks for the probability that a random 3-digit number has digits summing to 24. We'll enumerate all 3-digit numbers (100-999) and count how many have digit sum 24.

The digit sum can be at most 9+9+9=27, so 24 is possible but rare. We'll:
1. Iterate through all 3-digit numbers (100-999)
2. For each number, calculate the sum of its digits
3. Count how many numbers have digit sum exactly 24
4. Calculate the probability by dividing by total numbers (900)

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

count = 0
total = 0

for n in range(100, 1000):
    total += 1
    if digit_sum(n) == 24:
        count += 1
        print(n)  # Print each qualifying number immediately

probability = f"{count}/{total}"
print(f"\nProbability: {probability}")
```

The program will output each qualifying number as it finds them, then the final probability as a fraction. The exact probability can be derived from the count of numbers found (which will be very few since 24 is near the maximum possible digit sum for 3-digit numbers).
