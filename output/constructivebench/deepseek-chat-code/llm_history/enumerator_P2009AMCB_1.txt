[write_program]
This problem is asking to find all natural numbers b â‰¤ 5 such that the expression 50*(5-b) + 75*b equals 100*m for some natural number m. We need to enumerate all possible values of b from 0 to 5 and check which ones satisfy the condition.

The Python program will:
1. Iterate through all possible b values from 0 to 5
2. For each b, compute the expression value
3. Check if the result is divisible by 100
4. Print each valid b value that satisfies the condition

```python
def find_valid_b():
    for b in range(6):  # b can be 0 to 5 inclusive
        expression_value = 50 * (5 - b) + 75 * b
        if expression_value % 100 == 0:
            print(f"Valid b found: {b} (expression value = {expression_value})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_valid_b()
```
