Ground Truth Answer: {f : ℚ → ℝ | ∃ a : ℝ, a > 2 ∧ ∀ x : ℚ, f x = a * x}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ a > (2 : ℝ), ∀ x, f x = a * x}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer and ground truth answer are equivalent. Both define the set of functions f from ℚ to ℝ such that there exists a real number a > 2 where f(x) = a * x for all x ∈ ℚ. The proposed answer uses a more concise notation (omitting the type annotations and using ∃ a > 2 instead of ∃ a, a > 2), but the mathematical meaning is identical. The type ℝ is implied in the proposed answer by the comparison with 2, and the function type ℚ → ℝ is clear from context.
