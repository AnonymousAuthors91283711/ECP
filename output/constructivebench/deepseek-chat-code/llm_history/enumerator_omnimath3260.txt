This problem involves solving the equation \(512^x = 64^{240}\) for real \(x\). We can rewrite both sides with the same base since 512 and 64 are both powers of 2. The program will verify the solution by checking the logarithmic relationship between the exponents.

```python
import math

# Express both numbers as powers of 2
base_512 = 2**9  # since 512 = 2^9
base_64 = 2**6    # since 64 = 2^6

# The equation becomes: (2^9)^x = (2^6)^240
# Which simplifies to: 2^(9x) = 2^(6*240)
# Therefore: 9x = 6*240
# Solution: x = (6*240)/9

x = (6 * 240) / 9
print(x)  # Output the exact solution
```
