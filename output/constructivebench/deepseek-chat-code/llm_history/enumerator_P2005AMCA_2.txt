[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of two linear equations with one variable x. The first equation determines x uniquely, and the second equation then determines P2005AMCA_2_answer uniquely. We'll write a Python program that:

1. Solves the first equation 2x + 7 = 3 to find x
2. Uses this x value to solve the second equation P2005AMCA_2_answer * x - 10 = -2
3. Outputs both solutions

The program will compute exact rational values rather than floating point approximations.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Solve the first equation: 2x + 7 = 3
x = Fraction(3 - 7, 2)

# Solve the second equation: a*x - 10 = -2 where a is the answer
a = Fraction(-2 + 10, x)

print(f"Solution for x: {x}")
print(f"Solution for P2005AMCA_2_answer: {a}")
```
