This problem involves counting the number of valid 7-digit sequences where each digit is 0, 1, or 2, with the constraint that no two consecutive digits can be (0,1), (1,2), or (2,0). We'll enumerate all possible sequences of length 7 under these constraints using dynamic programming.

```python
def count_sequences():
    # The problem is equivalent to counting length-7 ternary strings avoiding 01, 12, 20
    n = 7
    # dp[i][j] = number of valid sequences of length i ending with j
    dp = [[0]*3 for _ in range(n+1)]
    
    # Base case: sequences of length 1
    for j in range(3):
        dp[1][j] = 1
    
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        for prev in range(3):
            for curr in range(3):
                # Check if transition is invalid
                if (prev == 0 and curr == 1) or (prev == 1 and curr == 2) or (prev == 2 and curr == 0):
                    continue
                dp[i][curr] += dp[i-1][prev]
    
    total = sum(dp[n])
    print(f"Total valid sequences of length 7: {total}")

count_sequences()
