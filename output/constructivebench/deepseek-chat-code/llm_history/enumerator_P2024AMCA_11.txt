This problem asks for the count of numbers b between 5 and 2024 (inclusive) where the base-b representation of 2024, when interpreted back as a base-b number, is divisible by 16. The final answer K must also satisfy that the sum of its digits in base 10 is 20.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Check each base b from 5 to 2024
2. Convert 2024 to base b
3. Interpret those digits back as a base-b number
4. Check if divisible by 16
5. Count valid bases and verify digit sum condition

```python
def digits(n, b):
    """Return digits of n in base b (most significant first)"""
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    d = []
    while n > 0:
        d.append(n % b)
        n = n // b
    return d[::-1]

def count_valid_bases():
    count = 0
    for b in range(5, 2025):
        d = digits(2024, b)
        # Evaluate the base-b number represented by digits d
        num = 0
        for digit in d:
            num = num * b + digit
        if num % 16 == 0:
            count += 1
            print(f"Valid base found: {b}, current count: {count}")
    
    # Check digit sum condition
    digit_sum = sum(int(d) for d in str(count))
    print(f"Final count: {count}, digit sum: {digit_sum}")
    return count

if __name__ == "__main__":
    count_valid_bases()
```
