This problem involves solving a system of equations to find the value of x that satisfies all three given conditions. The first two equations directly involve x, while the third is a constant check. We'll solve the first two equations to find possible values of x and verify them against all conditions.

```python
def check_conditions(x):
    # Check all three conditions
    cond1 = (5 + x) / 2 == 7
    cond2 = (x + 9) / 2 == 12
    cond3 = (5 + 9) / 2 == 10
    return cond1 and cond2 and cond3

# Solve first equation: (5 + x)/2 = 7 => x = 7*2 - 5 = 9
x1 = 7 * 2 - 5
print(f"Possible solution from first equation: x = {x1}")

# Solve second equation: (x + 9)/2 = 12 => x = 12*2 - 9 = 15
x2 = 12 * 2 - 9
print(f"Possible solution from second equation: x = {x2}")

# Check which solution satisfies all conditions
print("\nVerifying solutions:")
print(f"x = {x1} satisfies all conditions: {check_conditions(x1)}")
print(f"x = {x2} satisfies all conditions: {check_conditions(x2)}")

# The correct solution is the one that satisfies all conditions
if check_conditions(x1):
    print(f"\nThe solution is x = {x1}")
elif check_conditions(x2):
    print(f"\nThe solution is x = {x2}")
else:
    print("\nNo solution satisfies all conditions")
```
