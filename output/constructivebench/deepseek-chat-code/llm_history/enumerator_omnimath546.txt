[write_program]
This problem asks for all integers m where m² + 6m + 28 is a perfect square. We'll write a Python program to find such integers m by checking values within a reasonable range.

The approach:
1. We'll search for m in a symmetric range around 0 (since large |m| will make m² dominate)
2. For each m, compute k² = m² + 6m + 28
3. Check if k² is a perfect square by taking integer square root and verifying
4. Print all valid m values found

```python
def find_solutions():
    # Search range -100 to 100 is sufficient to find all solutions
    for m in range(-100, 101):
        k_squared = m**2 + 6*m + 28
        if k_squared < 0:
            continue  # Skip negative values which can't be squares
        k = int(round(k_squared**0.5))
        if k * k == k_squared:
            print(f"m = {m}, k = ±{k}")

    # Also check for larger m values incrementally
    # We stop when m² dominates and gap between squares exceeds linear terms
    m = 101
    while True:
        k_squared = m**2 + 6*m + 28
        k = int(round(k_squared**0.5))
        if k * k == k_squared:
            print(f"m = {m}, k = ±{k}")
        elif (k+1)**2 - k_squared > 12*m:  # Stop when next square is too far
            break
        m += 1
    
    m = -101
    while True:
        k_squared = m**2 + 6*m + 28
        if k_squared < 0:
            m -= 1
            continue
        k = int(round(k_squared**0.5))
        if k * k == k_squared:
            print(f"m = {m}, k = ±{k}")
        elif k_squared - (k-1)**2 > -12*m:  # Stop when previous square is too far
            break
        m -= 1
