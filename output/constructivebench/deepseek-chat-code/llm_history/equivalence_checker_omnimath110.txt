theorem omnimath110 (f g : ℝ → ℝ) :
    (∀ x y, f (x + y * g x) = g x + x * f y) ↔ (f, g) ∈ omnimath110_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: { (0, 0) } ∪ { (f, g) | f = g ∧ f 0 = 0 }
Proposed Answer: { (f, g) | (∀ x, f x = 0 ∧ g x = 0) ∨ 
  (∃ c, (∀ x, f x = x + c) ∧ (∀ x, g x = x - c)) ∨ 
  (∃ c, (∀ x, f x = -c) ∧ (∀ x, g x = c)) }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The functional equation is: ∀ x y, f (x + y * g x) = g x + x * f y

2. Ground Truth Answer:
- Contains two cases:
  a) Both f and g are identically zero (0,0)
  b) f = g and f(0) = 0

3. Proposed Answer:
- Contains three cases:
  a) Both f and g are identically zero (matches ground truth)
  b) f(x) = x + c and g(x) = x - c for some constant c
  c) f(x) = -c and g(x) = c for some constant c

Comparison:
- The first case (0,0) matches exactly.
- The second case in ground truth (f = g with f(0)=0) is not fully captured by the proposed answer. The proposed answer's second case (f(x)=x+c, g(x)=x-c) is a subset where f=g only when c=0, but doesn't cover all possible f=g functions with f(0)=0.
- The proposed answer's third case (f constant negative, g constant positive) doesn't appear in the ground truth and is incorrect as these wouldn't satisfy the original equation unless both are zero.

The proposed answer is partially correct but misses some solutions and includes incorrect ones.
