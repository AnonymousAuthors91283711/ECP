P(20) = 0.800000

Differences:
P(1) - P(2) = 0.010000
P(2) - P(3) = 0.010000
P(3) - P(4) = 0.010000
P(4) - P(5) = 0.010000
P(5) - P(6) = 0.010000
P(6) - P(7) = 0.010000
P(7) - P(8) = 0.010000
P(8) - P(9) = 0.010000
P(9) - P(10) = 0.010000
P(10) - P(11) = 0.010000
P(11) - P(12) = 0.010000
P(12) - P(13) = 0.010000
P(13) - P(14) = 0.010000
P(14) - P(15) = 0.010000
P(15) - P(16) = 0.010000
P(16) - P(17) = 0.010000
P(17) - P(18) = 0.010000
P(18) - P(19) = 0.010000
P(19) - P(20) = 0.010000

P(20) - P(15) = -0.050000. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
From the enumerated answers, we can observe that the reach probability decreases by 0.01 (1/100) for each increment in m. The difference P(20) - P(15) is consistently -0.05 (-5/100). Therefore, the closed form answer is:

<<<-(5 : ℚ)/100>>>
