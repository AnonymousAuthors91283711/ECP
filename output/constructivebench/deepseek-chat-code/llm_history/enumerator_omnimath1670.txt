This problem asks for a monic quartic polynomial with integer coefficients where all integer roots are negative, the sum of coefficients is 2009, and we need to find the constant term d. We'll enumerate possible polynomials by checking small negative roots and coefficient combinations.

```python
def find_polynomial():
    # We'll consider polynomials with roots -1, -2, -3, etc.
    # The polynomial is (x + r1)(x + r2)(x + r3)(x + r4) expanded
    # We need sum of coefficients = p(1) = 2009
    max_root = 10  # Reasonable upper bound for root magnitude
    
    for r1 in range(1, max_root + 1):
        for r2 in range(r1, max_root + 1):
            for r3 in range(r2, max_root + 1):
                for r4 in range(r3, max_root + 1):
                    # Calculate p(1) = (1 + r1)(1 + r2)(1 + r3)(1 + r4)
                    p1 = (1 + r1) * (1 + r2) * (1 + r3) * (1 + r4)
                    if p1 == 2009:
                        # Calculate d = r1*r2*r3*r4
                        d = r1 * r2 * r3 * r4
                        roots = (-r1, -r2, -r3, -r4)
                        print(f"Found polynomial with roots {roots}, d={d}")
                        return  # Stop after first solution since we want minimal d
    
    print("No solution found within the search range")
