[write_program]
This problem is from the IMO 2019 Shortlist (Problem N4). It asks to characterize all functions f: ℕ → ℕ such that for some constant C, for all a,b > C, (a + f(b)) divides (a² + b*f(a)). 

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible functions f for small values of C and n, looking for patterns. We'll focus on linear functions since they're most likely candidates.

```python
def solve(C_max=3, n_max=10):
    for C in range(0, C_max + 1):
        print(f"\nTesting C = {C}")
        # Try linear functions f(k) = k + d
        for d in range(-5, 6):
            valid = True
            for a in range(C + 1, n_max + 1):
                for b in range(C + 1, n_max + 1):
                    if a + b <= C:
                        continue
                    f_a = a + d
                    f_b = b + d
                    numerator = a**2 + b * f_a
                    denominator = a + f_b
                    if denominator == 0 or numerator % denominator != 0:
                        valid = False
                        break
                if not valid:
                    break
            if valid:
                print(f"Found candidate: f(k) = k + {d}")

        # Try constant functions f(k) = c
        for c in range(1, n_max + 1):
            valid = True
            for a in range(C + 1, n_max + 1):
                for b in range(C + 1, n_max + 1):
                    if a + b <= C:
                        continue
                    numerator = a**2 + b * c
                    denominator = a + c
                    if denominator == 0 or numerator % denominator != 0:
                        valid = False
                        break
                if not valid:
                    break
            if valid:
                print(f"Found candidate: f(k) = {c}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```

The program tests two types of functions:
1. Linear functions f(k) = k + d for small integer offsets d
2. Constant functions f(k) = c

For each candidate function, it verifies the divisibility condition for a range of values a,b > C. The output shows which functions satisfy the condition for small C values. This helps identify patterns that might lead to the general solution.
