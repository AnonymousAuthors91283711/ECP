This problem involves finding the average of the remaining 8 numbers when we know:
1. The average of all 10 numbers is 87
2. One number is 51 (at position j)
3. Another number is 99 (at position k)
4. j â‰  k (they are distinct positions)

We'll calculate this by:
1. Finding the total sum of all 10 numbers (87 * 10 = 870)
2. Subtracting the known numbers (51 + 99 = 150)
3. The remaining sum is 870 - 150 = 720
4. The average of the remaining 8 numbers is 720 / 8 = 90

Here's the Python program that verifies this calculation:

```python
def calculate_average():
    # Given parameters
    total_numbers = 10
    overall_avg = 87
    known_num1 = 51
    known_num2 = 99
    
    # Calculate total sum
    total_sum = overall_avg * total_numbers
    
    # Subtract known numbers
    remaining_sum = total_sum - known_num1 - known_num2
    
    # Calculate average of remaining numbers
    remaining_count = total_numbers - 2
    remaining_avg = remaining_sum / remaining_count
    
    # Print the result
    print(f"Average of remaining {remaining_count} numbers: {remaining_avg}")

calculate_average()
```

The program outputs:
```
Average of remaining 8 numbers: 90.0
```
