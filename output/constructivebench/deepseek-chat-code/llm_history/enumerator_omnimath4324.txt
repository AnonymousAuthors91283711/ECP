[write_program]
This problem is about proving the equivalence between a statement about periodic sequences and some unknown property `omnimath4324_answer`. The statement says that if for every sequence `a : ℕ → ℕ` and every starting index `k`, there exists a period `t` such that `a` is constant on the arithmetic progression `k + m*t`, then there exists a global period `T` that works for all `k`.

To explore this, we'll write a Python program that:
1. Generates simple periodic sequences
2. Checks if they satisfy the local periodicity condition
3. Verifies if they have a global period

We'll use small examples to build intuition about what `omnimath4324_answer` might be.

```python
def is_locally_periodic(sequence, max_k=5, max_t=5):
    """Check if sequence satisfies ∀k, ∃t, ∀m, a(k + m*t) = a(k)"""
    for k in range(max_k):
        found_t = False
        for t in range(1, max_t + 1):
            valid = True
            m = 1
            while k + m * t < len(sequence):
                if sequence[k + m * t] != sequence[k]:
                    valid = False
                    break
                m += 1
            if valid:
                found_t = True
                break
        if not found_t:
            return False
    return True

def has_global_period(sequence, max_T=5):
    """Check if sequence has a global period T"""
    for T in range(1, max_T + 1):
        is_periodic = True
        for k in range(len(sequence) - T):
            if sequence[k] != sequence[k + T]:
                is_periodic = False
                break
        if is_periodic:
            return True
    return False

# Test sequences
sequences = [
    [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2],  # periodic with T=2
    [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2],  # locally periodic but not globally
    [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3],  # periodic with T=3
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],  # constant
    [1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]   # locally periodic but not globally
]

for seq in sequences:
    print(f"Sequence: {seq}")
    print(f"Locally periodic: {is_locally_periodic(seq)}")
    print(f"Globally periodic: {has_global_period(seq)}")
    print()
```
