[write_program]
The problem asks to find all real numbers x from the set {-2, -1/2, 0, 1/2, 2} that satisfy x > x². We need to enumerate through each element of the set and check the condition.

Here's a Python program that:
1. Defines the given set of x values
2. Checks each value for the condition x > x²
3. Prints the values that satisfy the condition

```python
def main():
    xvals = [-2, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 2]
    print("Checking values in:", xvals)
    print("Values satisfying x > x²:")
    
    for x in xvals:
        if x > x * x:  # Equivalent to x > x² but avoids floating-point issues
            print(x)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program will output the values from the set that satisfy the inequality. The condition is checked using x > x*x instead of x > x**2 to avoid potential floating-point precision issues, though in this case with simple fractions it wouldn't matter. The output will show which values from the given set satisfy x > x².
