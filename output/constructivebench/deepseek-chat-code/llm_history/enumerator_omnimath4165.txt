[write_program]
This problem asks for all positive integer triples (x,y,z) satisfying:
1. z + y² + x³ = x*y*z
2. x = gcd(y,z)

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible triples up to reasonable bounds, checking both conditions. The gcd condition helps limit the search space.

```python
import math

def find_triples(max_x=20):
    for x in range(1, max_x + 1):
        # Since x = gcd(y,z), y and z must be multiples of x
        max_yz = 1000  # Empirical bound to find all solutions
        for y in range(x, max_yz + 1, x):
            for z in range(x, max_yz + 1, x):
                if math.gcd(y, z) != x:
                    continue
                lhs = z + y**2 + x**3
                rhs = x * y * z
                if lhs == rhs:
                    print(f"Found solution: ({x}, {y}, {z})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Searching for solutions to z + y² + x³ = x*y*z with x = gcd(y,z)")
    find_triples()
    print("Search complete")
```
