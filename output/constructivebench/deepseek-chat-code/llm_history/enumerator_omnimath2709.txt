[write_program]
This problem involves evaluating the expression `(x - 3)^2` when `x = -3`. The solution is straightforward algebraic substitution and simplification. We'll write a Python program that demonstrates this calculation.

```python
def evaluate_expression(x):
    return (x - 3) ** 2

# Given x = -3
x = -3
result = evaluate_expression(x)
print(f"For x = {x}, (x - 3)^2 = {result}")
```

The program defines a function to evaluate the expression and then computes it for the given value x = -3. The output will show the exact value of the expression. This demonstrates the calculation without revealing the final answer explicitly.
