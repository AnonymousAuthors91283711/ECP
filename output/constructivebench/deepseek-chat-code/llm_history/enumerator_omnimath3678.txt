The problem asks for the largest subset of points in an 8×8 grid (Fin 8 × Fin 8) such that for any two distinct points, if they share a common sum or difference (i.e., lie on the same diagonal), then no other point shares that sum or difference. This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of points where each pair either doesn't share any diagonals or has exclusive use of their shared diagonals.

We'll approach this by:
1. Modeling the grid coordinates and their sums/differences
2. Checking all possible subsets of increasing size to find the largest valid configuration
3. Using backtracking to efficiently search for valid configurations

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_valid(subset):
    sums = {}
    diffs = {}
    for x, y in subset:
        s = x + y
        d = x - y
        if s in sums or d in diffs:
            return False
        sums[s] = (x, y)
        diffs[d] = (x, y)
    return True

def find_max_points():
    grid = [(x, y) for x in range(8) for y in range(8)]
    max_n = 0
    # Check from largest possible down to find the maximum quickly
    for n in range(8, 0, -1):
        for subset in combinations(grid, n):
            if is_valid(subset):
                print(f"Found valid subset of size {n}: {subset}")
                return n
        print(f"No valid subsets of size {n} found")
    return 0

if __name__ == "__main__":
    max_points = find_max_points()
    print(f"Maximum points satisfying the condition: {max_points}")
```
