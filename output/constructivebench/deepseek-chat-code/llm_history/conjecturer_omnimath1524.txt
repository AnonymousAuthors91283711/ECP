theorem omnimath1524 : 
  Nat.card {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ n < 1998 ∧ Nat.Coprime n 1547} = omnimath1524_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Count of numbers <1998 coprime to 1547: 1487. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<1488>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks for the count of numbers between 0 and 1998 that are coprime with 1547. Since 1547 factors into 7×13×17, we can use Euler's totient function properties. The enumerated answer shows 1487, but the correct count should be 1488 as we need to include n=1 (which is coprime to everything). The totient approach would give φ(1547)=1547×(6/7)×(12/13)×(16/17)=1152, but we need to adjust for the range [1,1998].
