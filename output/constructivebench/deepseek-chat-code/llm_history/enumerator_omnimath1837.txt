This problem asks for the number of subsets S of {1,2,...,10} such that for every i from 1 to 9, at least one of i or i+1 is in S. We'll enumerate all possible subsets that satisfy this condition.

The approach is:
1. Generate all subsets of {1,2,...,10}
2. For each subset, check if it satisfies the condition that for every consecutive pair (i,i+1), at least one is in the subset
3. Count all valid subsets

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_valid_subset(subset, n=10):
    # Check for all i from 1 to 9, at least one of i or i+1 is in subset
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i not in subset and (i+1) not in subset:
            return False
    return True

def count_valid_subsets(n=10):
    count = 0
    elements = list(range(1, n+1))
    for k in range(0, n+1):  # All possible subset sizes
        for subset in combinations(elements, k):
            if is_valid_subset(subset, n):
                count += 1
                # Print each valid subset found (optional)
                # print(subset)
    return count

# For n=10 as in the problem
print(count_valid_subsets(10))
```
