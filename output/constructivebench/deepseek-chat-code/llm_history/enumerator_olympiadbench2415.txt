[write_program]
This problem involves finding a function `olympiadbench2415_answer` such that for natural numbers `m > 4`, its floor equals the sum of floors of k/3 for k from 1 to m-1. We'll write a Python program to enumerate values of this sum for small m to help identify the pattern.

The program will:
1. Calculate the sum for m from 5 to 20
2. Print each m and corresponding sum
3. Attempt to find a closed-form expression that matches these values

```python
def calculate_sum(m):
    """Calculate the sum of floor(k/3) for k from 1 to m-1"""
    return sum(k // 3 for k in range(1, m))

def main():
    print("m | sum(floor(k/3)) for k=1..m-1")
    print("-------------------------------")
    for m in range(5, 21):
        s = calculate_sum(m)
        print(f"{m:2} | {s:3}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
