This problem appears to be a simple multiplication problem where we need to find the product of two given ratios (29 and 16). The solution is straightforward - we just need to multiply these two numbers. Since the problem is tagged as a competition-level math problem, there might be some hidden complexity, but based on the given information, we'll proceed with the direct calculation.

Here's a Python program that calculates and prints the product of 29 and 16:

```python
# Calculate the product of the two given ratios (29 and 16)
exe_wye_ratio = 29
zed_exe_ratio = 16
result = zed_exe_ratio * exe_wye_ratio

# Print the parameters and the result
print(f"exe_wye_ratio = {exe_wye_ratio}")
print(f"zed_exe_ratio = {zed_exe_ratio}")
print(f"Result: {result}")
```
