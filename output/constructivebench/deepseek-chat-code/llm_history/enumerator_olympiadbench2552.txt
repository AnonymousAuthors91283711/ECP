[write_program]
This problem involves verifying a simple rational number equation. We'll write a Python program to compute the left-hand side of the equation and output the result as an exact fraction. The program will compute (2/5 + 5/2 + 1/(2*5)) and simplify it to its reduced form.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_expression():
    # Compute each term separately
    term1 = Fraction(2, 5)
    term2 = Fraction(5, 2)
    term3 = Fraction(1, 2*5)
    
    # Sum all terms
    result = term1 + term2 + term3
    
    # Print the result as a fraction
    print(f"{result.numerator}/{result.denominator}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_expression()
```
