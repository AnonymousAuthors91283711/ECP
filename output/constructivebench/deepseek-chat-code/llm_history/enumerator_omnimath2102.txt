[write_program]
This problem asks for the cardinality of the set of positive integers `a` such that the quadratic equation `x² - a*x + a = 0` has integer solutions. We'll write a Python program to enumerate such `a` values up to a reasonable threshold and count them.

The approach:
1. For each `a` from 1 to a threshold (we'll use 1000), check if the discriminant `a² - 4a` is a perfect square.
2. If it is, then there exist integer solutions to the equation.
3. Count and print all such `a` values.

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    if n < 0:
        return False
    root = math.isqrt(n)
    return root * root == n

max_a = 1000
count = 0

print("Positive integers a where x² - a*x + a = 0 has integer solutions:")
for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
    discriminant = a * a - 4 * a
    if is_perfect_square(discriminant):
        print(a)
        count += 1

print(f"Total count up to a={max_a}: {count}")
```
