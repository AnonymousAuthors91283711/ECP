This problem involves finding the value of a polynomial f at x=5 given certain functional conditions. We'll enumerate possible polynomial forms that satisfy the given conditions, particularly focusing on quadratic polynomials since higher degrees seem unlikely to satisfy all constraints.

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.polynomial import Polynomial

def check_conditions(f):
    # Check f(0) = 1
    if not np.isclose(f(0), 1):
        return False
    
    # Check f(2) + f(3) = 125
    if not np.isclose(f(2) + f(3), 125):
        return False
    
    # Check functional equation for sample points
    test_points = [1, -1, 0.5, 2]
    for x in test_points:
        left = f(x) * f(2 * x**2)
        right = f(2 * x**3 + x)
        if not np.isclose(left, right):
            return False
    return True

def find_polynomial():
    # Try quadratic polynomials f(x) = axÂ² + bx + c
    for a in np.arange(-10, 10, 0.5):
        for b in np.arange(-10, 10, 0.5):
            c = 1  # from f(0) = 1
            f = Polynomial([c, b, a])
            
            if check_conditions(f):
                print(f"Found candidate polynomial: {f}")
                print(f"f(5) = {f(5)}")
                return  # Stop after first valid candidate
    
    print("No quadratic polynomial found satisfying all conditions")
