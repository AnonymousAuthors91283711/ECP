abbrev omnimath2443_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath2443 (a : ℚ) :
  (∃ B : Matrix (Fin 4) (Fin 4) ℚ, B ^ 2 = !![a, -a, -1, 0; a, -a, 0, -1; 1, 0, a, -a; 0, 1, a, -a]) ↔ a = omnimath2443_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 0
Proposed Answer: 1 / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for which rational value(s) of 'a' there exists a 4×4 matrix B over ℚ such that B² equals the given matrix.

2. The ground truth answer is 0, meaning such a matrix B exists only when a=0.

3. The proposed answer is 1/2, suggesting such a matrix exists when a=1/2.

To determine equivalence:
- These are clearly different answers (0 vs 1/2)
- The ground truth suggests the only solution is a=0
- The proposed answer claims a different solution exists

We can verify by checking if the proposed answer works:
- For a=1/2, we'd need to find B such that B² equals the given matrix with a=1/2
- However, the ground truth states this is only possible when a=0
- Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect

<<<False>>>
