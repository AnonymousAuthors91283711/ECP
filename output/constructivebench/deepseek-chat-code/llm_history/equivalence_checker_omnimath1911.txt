Ground Truth Answer: 225
Proposed Answer: (6 * 5 / 2)^2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. Understanding the problem:
- We're working with a set S = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
- A counts unordered pairs of ordered pairs from S×S (Sym2 (S ×ˢ S))
- B counts pairs of unordered pairs from S (Sym2 S × Sym2 S)
- We need to compute A - B

2. Calculating A:
- S×S has 6×6 = 36 elements
- Sym2 of this counts unordered pairs: C(36,2) + 36 = 666
  (C(36,2) for distinct pairs, +36 for identical pairs)

3. Calculating B:
- Sym2 S counts unordered pairs from S: C(6,2) + 6 = 21
- B is square of this: 21 × 21 = 441

4. Final calculation:
A - B = 666 - 441 = 225

The proposed answer is (6*5/2)^2 = (30/2)^2 = 15^2 = 225, which matches the ground truth.
