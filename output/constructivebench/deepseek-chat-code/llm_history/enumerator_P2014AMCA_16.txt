This problem involves finding a natural number k such that when you sum a geometric series (8*10^i for i from 0 to k-1), multiply by 8, and express the result as a sum of digits d_i times powers of 10, the sum of the digits d_i equals 1000. We'll write a Python program to find such k by checking small values.

The approach is:
1. For each k, compute the left side (8 * sum of geometric series)
2. Convert this number to digits
3. Check if the digit sum equals 1000
4. Output any k that satisfies this condition

```python
def find_k():
    for k in range(1, 100):  # Try k up to 100
        # Compute 8 * sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 8*10^i
        geometric_sum = (8 * (10**k - 1)) // 9  # sum of 8*10^i
        total = 8 * geometric_sum
        
        # Convert to digits
        digits = list(map(int, str(total)))
        digit_sum = sum(digits)
        
        if digit_sum == 1000:
            print(f"Found k = {k}")
            return k  # Return first found (smallest) solution
    
    print("No solution found in range")
    return None

find_k()
```
