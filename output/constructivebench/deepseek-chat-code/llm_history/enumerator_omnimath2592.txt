[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimal natural number `a` that can be the 1000th term of a sequence satisfying:
1. The first term is the sum of factorials from 0 to 100
2. For all i â‰¥ 1, seq[i] + seq[i+1] is an odd square
3. The 1000th term equals `a`

We'll write a Python program to explore small cases and look for patterns. Since computing up to 1000 terms is impractical, we'll examine the sequence behavior with smaller initial ranges.

```python
import math

def is_odd_square(n):
    """Check if n is an odd perfect square."""
    root = math.isqrt(n)
    return root * root == n and root % 2 == 1

def find_min_a(max_terms=10, start_range=5):
    """Find minimal possible a for sequences up to max_terms."""
    # Compute initial term: sum of factorials 0! to 100!
    # For testing, we'll use smaller sums (0! to n!)
    for n in range(1, start_range+1):
        s1 = sum(math.factorial(i) for i in range(n+1))
        print(f"\nTesting initial sum 0!..{n}! = {s1}")
        
        # Track sequences and their last terms
        sequences = [(s1,)]
        for step in range(1, max_terms+1):
            new_sequences = []
            for seq in sequences:
                last = seq[-1]
                # Find possible next terms where last + next is odd square
                target_min = (math.isqrt(last) - 1)**2
                target_max = (math.isqrt(last) + 100)**2
                for k in range(1, 1000, 2):
                    target = k*k
                    if target > last:
                        next_term = target - last
                        new_seq = seq + (next_term,)
                        new_sequences.append(new_seq)
            
            if not new_sequences:
                print(f"No valid sequences at step {step}")
                break
            
            sequences = new_sequences
            min_last = min(seq[-1] for seq in sequences)
            print(f"Step {step}: min last term = {min_last}")
            if step == max_terms:
                return min_last

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_a(max_terms=5, start_range=3)
```
