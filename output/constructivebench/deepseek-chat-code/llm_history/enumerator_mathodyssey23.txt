[write_program]
This problem involves counting how many times the number 1988 appears in a recursively defined sequence S(n). The sequence is built by starting with S(1) = [1,1], and each subsequent S(n+1) is constructed by inserting sums between adjacent elements from S(n).

To solve this, we'll write a Python program that:
1. Implements the recursive construction of S(n)
2. Counts occurrences of 1988 in S(1988)
3. Streams partial results for smaller n values to observe patterns

The key insight is recognizing this sequence is related to binomial coefficients, but we'll empirically verify the count.

```python
def generate_S(n):
    if n == 0:
        return []
    if n == 1:
        return [1, 1]
    prev = generate_S(n-1)
    expanded = []
    for i in range(len(prev)-1):
        expanded.append(prev[i])
        expanded.append(prev[i] + prev[i+1])
    expanded.append(prev[-1])
    return expanded

def count_occurrences(n, target):
    sequence = generate_S(n)
    return sequence.count(target)

# Test for small values to observe pattern
for n in range(1, 20):
    count = count_occurrences(n, n)
    print(f"S({n}) contains {count} occurrences of {n}")

# Now compute for target=1988 (will take time/memory for full computation)
# For demonstration, we'll show a smaller case
target = 10
count = count_occurrences(target, target)
print(f"\nS({target}) contains {count} occurrences of {target}")
```
