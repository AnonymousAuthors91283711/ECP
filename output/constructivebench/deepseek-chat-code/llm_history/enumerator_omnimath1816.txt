This problem involves counting the number of valid colorings of a cube's vertices (represented as binary vectors) where no two adjacent vertices are both colored (True). The adjacency is defined by cubeAdj which checks if two vertices differ by exactly one coordinate (Hamming distance 1).

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible colorings of the 8 vertices and count those that satisfy the adjacency constraint. Since 2^8 = 256 possible colorings is manageable, we'll brute-force check all possibilities.

```python
def main():
    # Generate all 8-bit numbers representing vertex colorings
    total = 0
    for coloring in range(256):
        valid = True
        # Check all pairs of vertices
        for i in range(8):
            if not valid:
                break
            for j in range(i+1, 8):
                # Check if vertices are adjacent and both colored
                x1, y1, z1 = i//4, (i//2)%2, i%2
                x2, y2, z2 = j//4, (j//2)%2, j%2
                adjacent = (abs(x1-x2) + abs(y1-y2) + abs(z1-z2)) == 1
                both_colored = (coloring >> i) & 1 and (coloring >> j) & 1
                if adjacent and both_colored:
                    valid = False
                    break
        if valid:
            total += 1
            print(f"Valid coloring found: {coloring:08b} (decimal {coloring})")
    print(f"Total valid colorings: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
