[write_program]
This problem appears to be about finding a function that maps pairs of natural numbers to other pairs, with a specific example given. Since we don't have the exact problem statement, I'll create a program that enumerates possible simple functions that could satisfy the given example (13,0) → (15,30). We'll look for linear combinations and other simple transformations.

```python
def enumerate_functions():
    # We'll test simple linear combinations for both output components
    # First component: a*13 + b*0 + c = 15 → 13a + c = 15
    # Second component: d*13 + e*0 + f = 30 → 13d + f = 30
    
    # Try small integer coefficients (absolute value up to 3)
    for a in range(-3, 4):
        for c in range(-10, 31):
            if 13*a + c == 15:
                for d in range(-3, 4):
                    for f in range(-10, 61):
                        if 13*d + f == 30:
                            # Found a candidate function
                            print(f"Function: (x,y) → ({a}x + {c}, {d}x + {f})")
                            # Test another input to see if it's too trivial
                            test_input = (5, 2)
                            output = (a*test_input[0] + c, d*test_input[0] + f)
                            print(f"Test on (5,2): {output}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_functions()
```
