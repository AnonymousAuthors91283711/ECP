[write_program]
This problem asks to find all pairs of two-digit numbers (a, b) where:
1. a = 10c + d and b = 10d + c (where c,d are digits 0-9)
2. a * b = b * a (which is always true, but the condition implies a/b = b/a)
3. Therefore, we're looking for pairs where a² = b² ⇒ a = b (since a,b > 0)

However, the condition a = 10c + d and b = 10d + c with a = b implies:
10c + d = 10d + c ⇒ 9c = 9d ⇒ c = d
Thus, the only solutions are numbers where both digits are equal (11, 22, ..., 99).

Here's a Python program to enumerate these pairs:

```python
def find_pairs():
    # Enumerate all two-digit numbers with equal digits
    for c in range(1, 10):  # first digit can't be 0
        d = c
        a = 10 * c + d
        b = 10 * d + c
        print(f"Found pair: ({a}, {b})")

    print("All solutions are numbers where both digits are equal (11, 22, ..., 99)")

find_pairs()
```
