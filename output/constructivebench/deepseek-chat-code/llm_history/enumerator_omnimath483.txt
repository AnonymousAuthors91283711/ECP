This problem asks to find all triples (a,b,c) of positive integers that satisfy:
1. a + b + c = 10
2. a*b*c + 9 = a*b + b*c + c*a

We'll enumerate all possible triples where a,b,c are positive integers summing to 10, then check the second condition. Since the order matters (unless specified otherwise), we'll consider all permutations.

```python
def main():
    count = 0
    # Enumerate all positive integer triples (a,b,c) with a+b+c=10
    for a in range(1, 9):
        for b in range(1, 10 - a):
            c = 10 - a - b
            if c <= 0:
                continue
            # Check the second condition
            if a*b*c + 9 == a*b + b*c + c*a:
                print(f"Found solution: ({a}, {b}, {c})")
                count += 1
    print(f"Total number of solutions: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
