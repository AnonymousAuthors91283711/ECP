This problem asks for the last two digits of the floor of (3 + sqrt(5))^34. We can approach this by observing that (3+sqrt(5))^n + (3-sqrt(5))^n is an integer, and since (3-sqrt(5))^n is small, the floor is essentially (3+sqrt(5))^n + (3-sqrt(5))^n - 1. We'll compute this modulo 100.

```python
def compute_last_two_digits(n):
    # We'll compute (3 + sqrt5)^n + (3 - sqrt5)^n mod 100
    # Using recurrence relation: a_n = 6*a_{n-1} - 4*a_{n-2}
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    if n == 1:
        return 6
    a, b = 2, 6
    for _ in range(2, n+1):
        a, b = b, (6 * b - 4 * a) % 100
    return b

n = 34
result = (compute_last_two_digits(n) - 1) % 100
print(result)
```
