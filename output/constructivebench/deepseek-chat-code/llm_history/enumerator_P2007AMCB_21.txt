[write_program]
This problem asks for the count of numbers between 1 and 2007 (inclusive) whose base-3 representation is a palindrome. We'll write a Python program to enumerate these numbers by checking each number in the range, converting it to base-3, and verifying if it's a palindrome.

```python
def is_palindrome_base3(n):
    """Check if n's base-3 representation is a palindrome."""
    digits = []
    while n > 0:
        digits.append(n % 3)
        n = n // 3
    return digits == digits[::-1]

count = 0
for num in range(1, 2008):
    if is_palindrome_base3(num):
        count += 1
        print(num)  # Stream found palindromes

print(f"Total count: {count}")  # Final answer
```

The program:
1. Defines a helper function to check if a number's base-3 digits form a palindrome
2. Iterates through numbers 1 to 2007
3. For each number, converts it to base-3 and checks the palindrome condition
4. Prints each qualifying number as it's found
5. Finally prints the total count of such numbers

The output will show all base-3 palindromic numbers in the range, followed by the final count. This matches the problem's requirement to find how many numbers between 1 and 2007 have palindromic base-3 representations.
