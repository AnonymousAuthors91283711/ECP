[write_program]
This problem involves computing a weighted sum of powers of 2 and (-1) raised to the count of 1's in the binary representation of numbers from 0 to 15. We'll write a Python program to compute this sum exactly as a rational number.

The approach:
1. Define a function to count 1's in binary representation (s(n))
2. Compute the sum for n from 0 to 15
3. Multiply by 1/255 and simplify the fraction
4. Output the exact rational result

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from math import gcd

def count_ones(n):
    """Count number of 1's in binary representation of n"""
    return bin(n).count('1')

def compute_sum():
    total = Fraction(0, 1)
    for n in range(16):
        s_n = count_ones(n)
        term = Fraction(2**n * ((-1)**s_n), 1)
        total += term
    result = total * Fraction(1, 255)
    # Simplify the fraction
    simplified = result.limit_denominator()
    print(f"The exact rational result is: {simplified.numerator}/{simplified.denominator}")

compute_sum()
```
