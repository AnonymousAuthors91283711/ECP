theorem omnimath1944 : 
  Fintype.card {f : Fin 5 → Fin 5 // 
    Bijective f ∧ 
    ∀ (i j : Fin 5), (i.val - j.val) ≥ 3 → f j < f i} = omnimath1944_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Total count: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the problem statement and the enumerated answer count of 0, we can deduce that there are no bijective functions from Fin 5 to Fin 5 satisfying the given condition where differences of 3 or more must map to decreasing values. This makes sense because for a permutation of 5 elements, it's impossible to satisfy the condition for all pairs with difference ≥ 3.
