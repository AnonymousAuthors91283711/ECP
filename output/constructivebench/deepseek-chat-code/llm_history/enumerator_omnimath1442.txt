[write_program]
This problem involves computing the sum of an infinite series. The series is ∑(n=0 to ∞) (n+1)*(1/1998)^n. We recognize this as a power series that can be evaluated using known formulas for convergent series.

The general form is ∑(n=0 to ∞) (n+1)*r^n = 1/(1-r)^2 for |r|<1. Here r=1/1998, which satisfies |r|<1. Therefore, the sum should be 1/(1-1/1998)^2 = 1998^2/1997^2.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Compute partial sums to verify convergence
2. Compare with the theoretical value
3. Print both exact and decimal approximations

```python
def compute_series_sum():
    r = 1/1998
    theoretical_sum = 1 / (1 - r)**2
    
    # Compute partial sums
    partial_sum = 0.0
    for n in range(0, 1000):  # Sufficiently large to see convergence
        term = (n + 1) * (r ** n)
        partial_sum += term
        # Print every 100 terms to show convergence
        if n % 100 == 0:
            print(f"After {n} terms: partial sum = {partial_sum}")
    
    print("\nTheoretical sum (exact rational form): (1998^2)/(1997^2)")
    print(f"Theoretical sum (decimal): {theoretical_sum}")
    print(f"Final partial sum after 1000 terms: {partial_sum}")
    print(f"Difference: {abs(theoretical_sum - partial_sum)}")

    compute_series_sum()
