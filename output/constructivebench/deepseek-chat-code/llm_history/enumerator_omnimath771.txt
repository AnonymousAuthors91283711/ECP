The problem asks for the sum of the digits of the binomial coefficient C(1000, 100). To solve this computationally, we'll calculate C(1000, 100), convert it to its decimal digits, and sum them. Since C(1000, 100) is extremely large (about 6.4e139), we'll use Python's arbitrary-precision integers.

```python
from math import comb

def sum_digits(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

n = 1000
k = 100
binomial = comb(n, k)
digit_sum = sum_digits(binomial)
print(f"Sum of digits of C({n}, {k}): {digit_sum}")
```
