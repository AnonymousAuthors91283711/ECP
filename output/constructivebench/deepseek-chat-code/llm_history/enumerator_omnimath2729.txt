The problem is to find the value of x that satisfies the equation 1/6 + 1/3 = 1/x. This is a simple algebraic equation that can be solved by combining the fractions and taking reciprocals. We'll write a Python program to verify the solution numerically.

```python
# Solving 1/6 + 1/3 = 1/x
# First compute left side: 1/6 + 1/3 = 1/6 + 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2
# So 1/x = 1/2 => x = 2

# Verification code:
left_side = 1/6 + 1/3
x = 1 / left_side
print(f"The solution is x = {x}")
```

The program computes the left side of the equation (1/6 + 1/3 = 1/2) and then finds x by taking the reciprocal. The output confirms that x = 2 is the solution.
