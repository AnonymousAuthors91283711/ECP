Explanation: The problem involves finding P(-1) given functional conditions on polynomial P. The condition suggests a pattern where P(-1) evaluates to a simple fraction. The enumerated answer is empty, but the functional equation hints at a reciprocal relationship, leading to the conjecture P(-1) = 1/7.
