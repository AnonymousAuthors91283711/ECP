This problem asks for the smallest size k of a subset B of a 100-element set X such that B ∪ f(B) = X, where f is a fixed-point-free function (f(x)≠x) with the additional property that any 40-element subset A of X intersects its image f(A). The solution involves finding the minimal k where such a B exists.

We'll approach this by:
1. Modeling the problem for smaller sizes (n<100) to observe patterns
2. Implementing a brute-force search for small n to find minimal k
3. Looking for a pattern that might generalize to n=100

```python
from itertools import combinations

def minimal_cover_size(n, forbidden_size):
    """Find minimal k where exists B of size k with B ∪ f(B) = [n]
    and f has no fixed points and any subset of size 'forbidden_size' intersects its image"""
    # Try all possible functions f (fixed-point-free with the intersection property)
    # For small n, we'll brute-force check all derangements
    from math import factorial
    print(f"Testing n={n}, forbidden_size={forbidden_size}")
    
    # First find all derangements (fixed-point-free permutations)
    def derangements():
        from itertools import permutations
        for p in permutations(range(n)):
            if all(i != p[i] for i in range(n)):
                yield p
    
    min_k = n  # initialize with worst case
    
    # For small n, we can check all derangements
    if n <= 6:
        for f in derangements():
            # Check the intersection property
            valid = True
            for A in combinations(range(n), forbidden_size):
                if not set(A) & {f[x] for x in A}:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                continue
                
            # Find minimal B for this f
            for k in range(1, n):
                for B in combinations(range(n), k):
                    if set(B) | {f[x] for x in B} == set(range(n)):
                        if k < min_k:
                            min_k = k
                            print(f"Found smaller k={k} for n={n}")
                        break
                if min_k == k:
                    break
        print(f"Minimal k for n={n}: {min_k}")
        return min_k
    else:
        print("n too large for brute-force, skipping")
        return None

# Test small cases to observe pattern
for n in range(4, 7):
    forbidden_size = n // 2  # roughly 40/100 ratio
    minimal_cover_size(n, forbidden_size)

# For n=100, the pattern suggests k=60 (based on n-k >= forbidden_size)
# But we can't compute it directly here
print("For n=100, conjectured minimal k might be 60 based on pattern")
