[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of subsets of {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} that contain at least one prime number. The primes in this range are {2,3,5,7}. We'll calculate this by:
1. Finding total number of subsets (2^8 = 256)
2. Subtracting subsets with no primes (subsets of {4,6,8,9})
3. The answer is 256 - 2^4 = 256 - 16 = 240

Here's a Python program that verifies this by enumerating all possible subsets:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def solve():
    nums = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    primes = {n for n in nums if is_prime(n)}
    total = 0
    
    for r in range(1, len(nums)+1):
        for subset in combinations(nums, r):
            if any(x in primes for x in subset):
                total += 1
                print(subset)  # Print each valid subset
    
    print("Total subsets with at least one prime:", total)

solve()
```
