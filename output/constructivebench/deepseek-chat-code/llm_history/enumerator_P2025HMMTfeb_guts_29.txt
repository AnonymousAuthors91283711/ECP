[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of three equations with three variables (a, b, c). The equations are symmetric in structure but with different right-hand sides. We'll write a program to numerically search for possible solutions by testing small rational values for a, b, c.

The approach will be:
1. Iterate through possible rational values for a, b, c in a reasonable range
2. For each combination, check if it approximately satisfies all three equations
3. Print combinations that come close to satisfying all equations

```python
import math

def evaluate_eq1(a, b):
    return a * math.sqrt(1 + b**2) + b * math.sqrt(1 + a**2)

def evaluate_eq2(b, c):
    return b * math.sqrt(1 + c**2) + c * math.sqrt(1 + b**2)

def evaluate_eq3(c, a):
    return c * math.sqrt(1 + a**2) + a * math.sqrt(1 + c**2)

target1 = 3/4
target2 = 5/12
target3 = 21/20
tolerance = 1e-6

# Search over rational values with denominator up to 20
for numerator_a in range(-40, 41):
    for denominator_a in range(1, 21):
        a = numerator_a / denominator_a
        for numerator_b in range(-40, 41):
            for denominator_b in range(1, 21):
                b = numerator_b / denominator_b
                val1 = evaluate_eq1(a, b)
                if abs(val1 - target1) < tolerance:
                    for numerator_c in range(-40, 41):
                        for denominator_c in range(1, 21):
                            c = numerator_c / denominator_c
                            val2 = evaluate_eq2(b, c)
                            val3 = evaluate_eq3(c, a)
                            if (abs(val2 - target2) < tolerance and 
                                abs(val3 - target3) < tolerance):
                                print(f"Found candidate: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
                                print(f"Equation values: {val1}, {val2}, {val3}")

Judgement:
The original program is attempting to solve a system of three equations with three variables (a, b, c) by brute-forcing through rational numbers with denominators up to 20. However, it has several issues:

1. The search space is too large (80 numerators × 20 denominators for each variable = 80×20×80×20×80×20 = 4.096 billion combinations) which makes it impractical to run in reasonable time.

2. The program doesn't output any results because it either:
   - Doesn't find any solutions within the given search space
   - Takes too long to complete the search
   - The tolerance might be too strict for the numerical precision

3. The problem requires exact solutions, but the program only checks for approximate matches.

4. The program doesn't follow the requirement to output partial results as they're found.

The problem appears to be from a math competition (HMMT) and likely has exact rational solutions. A better approach would be to:
1. Look for patterns or exact solutions
2. Use symbolic computation if possible
3. Narrow down the search space based on mathematical insights

<<<False>>>

Here's a corrected version that uses a more efficient search strategy and outputs partial results:

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def evaluate_eq1(a, b):
    return a * math.sqrt(1 + b**2) + b * math.sqrt(1 + a**2)

def evaluate_eq2(b, c):
    return b * math.sqrt(1 + c**2) + c * math.sqrt(1 + b**2)

def evaluate_eq3(c, a):
    return c * math.sqrt(1 + a**2) + a * math.sqrt(1 + c**2)

target1 = Fraction(3, 4)
target2 = Fraction(5, 12)
target3 = Fraction(21, 20)
tolerance = 1e-6

# Search over simple fractions first
for denom in range(1, 9):
    for num_a in range(-denom, denom+1):
        if num_a == 0:
            continue
        a = Fraction(num_a, denom)
        for num_b in range(-denom, denom+1):
            if num_b == 0:
                continue
            b = Fraction(num_b, denom)
            val1

Explanation:
The problem presents a system of three equations with three real variables (a, b, c) involving square roots. The goal is to find the value of 'a' that satisfies all three equations. However, the provided "program" is empty (None) and fails to address the problem in any way.

Since there's no actual program to evaluate, we must reject this submission. The problem requires a numerical solution approach, likely involving:
1. Symbolic manipulation to simplify the equations
2. Numerical methods to find approximate solutions
3. Verification of solutions against all three equations

The solution should output candidate values for 'a' that satisfy the equations, preferably with increasing precision until a satisfactory solution is found.

    eq2 = abs(b * math.sqrt(1 + c**2) + c * math.sqrt(1 + b**2) - 5/12) < tol
    eq3 = abs(c * math.sqrt(1 + a**2) + a * math.sqrt(1 + c**2) - 21/20) < tol
