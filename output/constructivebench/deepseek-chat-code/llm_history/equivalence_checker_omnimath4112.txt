Ground Truth Answer: {fun x : ℝ => 1 / 2, fun x : ℝ => 0, fun x : ℝ => x ^ 2}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℝ, f = fun x => c * x^2} ∪ {fun _ => 0}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is close but not exactly equivalent to the ground truth. The ground truth includes three specific functions: the constant zero function, the constant 1/2 function, and the quadratic function x². The proposed answer includes all quadratic functions of the form c*x² (for any constant c) plus the zero function. While the zero function and x² (case when c=1) are correct, the proposed answer misses the specific constant function 1/2 and includes many other quadratic functions that may not satisfy the original condition. The 1/2 case is a special solution that isn't captured by the proposed form.
