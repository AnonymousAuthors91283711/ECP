Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n / 2 + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (n + 1) / 2 + 1
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: `n / 2 + 1`
2. Proposed: `(n + 1) / 2 + 1`

For natural number division (which truncates), these give different results for odd n:

- When n is odd (e.g., n=5):
  - Ground Truth: 5/2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3
  - Proposed: (5+1)/2 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4

For even n (e.g., n=4):
- Ground Truth: 4/2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3
- Proposed: (4+1)/2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3

The answers only match when n is even, but differ when n is odd. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
