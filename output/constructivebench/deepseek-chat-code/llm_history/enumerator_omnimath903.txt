This problem asks for the count of 4-digit numbers (1000 to 9999) that have at least one repeated digit. We'll enumerate all 4-digit numbers and count those with duplicate digits.

The approach:
1. Iterate through all numbers from 1000 to 9999
2. For each number, convert it to a string to examine digits
3. Check if any digit appears more than once
4. Count and print qualifying numbers

```python
def has_repeated_digit(n):
    s = str(n)
    return len(s) != len(set(s))

count = 0
for n in range(1000, 10000):
    if has_repeated_digit(n):
        count += 1
        print(n)  # Stream partial results

print(f"Total count: {count}")  # Final answer
```
