This problem asks for the largest N such that there exists a family of N permutations (bijective functions) of {1,...,100} where any two distinct permutations T_r and T_s have at least one coordinate c where |T_r(c) - T_s(c)| ≥ 2. This is equivalent to finding the largest family of permutations with Hamming distance at least 100 - 99 = 1 (but actually stronger since we require at least one position with difference ≥ 2).

We'll enumerate small cases to find a pattern. The solution likely involves the pigeonhole principle and permutation properties.

```python
def is_valid_permutation_family(perms):
    """Check if any two permutations have at least one position differing by at least 2"""
    n = len(perms)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if all(abs(perms[i][k] - perms[j][k]) <= 1 for k in range(len(perms[i]))):
                return False
    return True

def generate_permutations(n, k):
    """Generate all possible permutations of k elements (0..k-1) for n positions"""
    from itertools import permutations
    return list(permutations(range(k), n))

def find_max_family(n, k):
    """Find maximum family size for permutations of k elements with n positions"""
    perms = generate_permutations(n, k)
    max_family = 0
    
    # Try all possible family sizes from 1 upwards
    for family_size in range(1, len(perms)+1):
        from itertools import combinations
        for family in combinations(perms, family_size):
            if is_valid_permutation_family(family):
                print(f"Found valid family of size {family_size}: {family}")
                max_family = family_size
                break  # We want the maximum, so continue to next size
        else:
            break  # No family of this size exists, we've found the maximum
    
    print(f"Maximum family size for n={n}, k={k}: {max_family}")
    return max_family

# Test small cases
print("Testing n=2, k=3")
find_max_family(2, 3)

print("\nTesting n=3, k=4")
find_max_family(3, 4)
```
