This problem asks for the number of weakly increasing integer sequences (a₁,a₂,a₃,a₄,a₅) where each aᵢ ≤ i (the index). We'll enumerate all possible sequences that satisfy these conditions.

The approach is to:
1. Generate all weakly increasing sequences of length 5
2. Filter those where each element aᵢ ≤ i
3. Count the valid sequences

We'll implement this by generating all combinations with replacement (for weakly increasing property) and checking the index constraints.

```python
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement

def count_valid_sequences():
    count = 0
    # Possible values for each position: a1 ∈ {0,1}, a2 ∈ {0,1,2}, etc.
    max_values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Since indices are 1-based in the problem
    
    # Generate all weakly increasing sequences of length 5
    for seq in combinations_with_replacement(range(0, 6), 5):
        valid = True
        # Check each element is ≤ its 1-based index
        for i in range(5):
            if seq[i] > i+1:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1
            print(seq)  # Print each valid sequence
    
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

count_valid_sequences()
```
