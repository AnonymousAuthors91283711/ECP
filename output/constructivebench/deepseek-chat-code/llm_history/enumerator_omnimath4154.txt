[write_program]
This problem asks for all triples (p, x, y) where p is prime, x and y are positive integers, and there exist exponents a and b such that x^(p-1) + y = p^a and x + y^(p-1) = p^b. We'll write a Python program to enumerate small solutions.

The approach:
1. Iterate through small primes p
2. For each p, iterate through reasonable x and y values
3. Check if both expressions result in powers of p
4. Print valid triples (p, x, y) as they're found

We'll limit the search to p < 10, x,y < 100 for practicality.

```python
import math

def is_power_of_p(n, p):
    if n == 0:
        return False
    while n % p == 0:
        n = n // p
    return n == 1

def main():
    max_p = 10
    max_xy = 100
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]
    
    for p in primes:
        for x in range(1, max_xy + 1):
            for y in range(1, max_xy + 1):
                term1 = x ** (p - 1) + y
                term2 = x + y ** (p - 1)
                if is_power_of_p(term1, p) and is_power_of_p(term2, p):
                    print(f"Found solution: p={p}, x={x}, y={y}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
