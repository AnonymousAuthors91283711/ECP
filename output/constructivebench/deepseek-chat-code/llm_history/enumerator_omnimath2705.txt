This problem appears to be about finding a function `omnimath2705_answer` that satisfies the given equation for all real numbers x. The equation is linear, so we can simply solve for the function by simplifying the right-hand side.

The program will:
1. Define the function that satisfies the equation
2. Print sample evaluations to verify correctness
3. Since it's a simple linear function, we'll just show the function definition and sample points

```python
def omnimath2705_answer(x):
    return 3 * (x - 2) + 5

# Print sample evaluations to verify the function works
sample_points = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
print("Sample evaluations:")
for x in sample_points:
    print(f"f({x}) = {omnimath2705_answer(x)}")
```
