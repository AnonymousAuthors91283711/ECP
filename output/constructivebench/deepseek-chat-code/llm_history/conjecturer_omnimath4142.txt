theorem omnimath4142 (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
  (∀ x y, |x| * f y + y * f x = f (x * y) + f (x^2) + f (f y)) ↔ f ∈ omnimath4142_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing linear functions f(x) = a*x + b:
Found solution: f(x) = 0.0*x + 0.0

Testing quadratic functions f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c:
Found solution: f(x) = 0.0*x^2 + 0.0*x + 0.0

Testing constant functions f(x) = c:
Found solution: f(x) = 0.0. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
<<<{f | ∀ x, f x = 0}>>>
