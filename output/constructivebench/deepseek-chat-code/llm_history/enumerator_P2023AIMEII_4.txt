This problem involves finding the sum of squares of all real numbers x that satisfy a system of equations with y and z. We'll enumerate possible x values by solving the system numerically within a reasonable range.

The approach is:
1. Use the given equations to derive constraints on x
2. Sample x values in a range that likely contains all solutions
3. For each x, solve for y and z using the first two equations
4. Check if the third equation is satisfied within numerical tolerance
5. Collect all valid x values and compute their squared sum

```python
import numpy as np
from itertools import product

def solve_system():
    # We'll search for x in [-2, 4] since larger values seem unlikely
    x_samples = np.linspace(-2, 4, 10000)
    solutions = []
    tol = 1e-6
    
    for x in x_samples:
        # From x + y + z = 1 and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2
        # We can derive y + z = 1 - x and yz = (x^2 - x - 1)/2
        y_plus_z = 1 - x
        yz = (x**2 - x - 1)/2
        
        # Check if real solutions exist (discriminant >= 0)
        discriminant = y_plus_z**2 - 4*yz
        if discriminant < -tol:
            continue
            
        # Find possible y and z pairs
        if discriminant < tol:
            discriminant = 0
        sqrt_disc = np.sqrt(discriminant)
        y1 = (y_plus_z + sqrt_disc)/2
        y2 = (y_plus_z - sqrt_disc)/2
        
        # Check both possible (y,z) pairs
        for y in [y1, y2]:
            z = y_plus_z - y
            # Verify x^3 + y^3 + z^3 â‰ˆ 3
            lhs = x**3 + y**3 + z**3
            if abs(lhs - 3) < tol:
                solutions.append(x)
                break
    
    # Remove duplicates (within tolerance) and compute sum of squares
    unique_solutions = []
    for x in solutions:
        if not any(abs(x - u) < tol for u in unique_solutions):
            unique_solutions.append(x)
    
    sum_squares = sum(x**2 for x in unique_solutions)
    print(f"Found solutions: {unique_solutions}")
    print(f"Sum of squares: {sum_squares}")
