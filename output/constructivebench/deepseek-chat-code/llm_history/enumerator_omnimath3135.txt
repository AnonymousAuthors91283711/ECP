This problem asks for the probability that two distinct elements from the set {-3, -1, 0, 2, 4} multiply to zero. We'll enumerate all possible ordered pairs (a,b) where aâ‰ b and count how many satisfy a*b=0.

The approach:
1. Generate all ordered pairs from the set
2. Filter out pairs where elements are equal
3. Count pairs where product is zero (which happens when either element is 0)
4. Calculate probability as favorable/total pairs

```python
def main():
    S = [-3, -1, 0, 2, 4]
    total_pairs = 0
    favorable = 0
    
    for a in S:
        for b in S:
            if a != b:
                total_pairs += 1
                if a * b == 0:
                    favorable += 1
                    print(f"Found favorable pair: ({a}, {b})")
    
    print(f"Total pairs: {total_pairs}")
    print(f"Favorable pairs: {favorable}")
    print(f"Probability: {favorable}/{total_pairs} = {favorable/total_pairs}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
