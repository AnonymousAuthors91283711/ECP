[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimum value of x² + 16y² under the constraint 3x + 4y = 10. We'll approach this by:

1. Expressing y in terms of x from the constraint
2. Substituting into the objective function to get a quadratic in x
3. Finding the minimum of this quadratic function

The Python program will:
1. Symbolically express y from the constraint
2. Formulate the objective function in terms of x only
3. Find the minimum by taking the derivative and setting to zero
4. Calculate the minimal value

```python
import sympy as sp

def find_min_value():
    x = sp.symbols('x')
    # Express y from 3x + 4y = 10
    y = (10 - 3*x)/4
    # Objective function: x^2 + 16y^2
    f = x**2 + 16*y**2
    # Simplify the expression
    f = sp.simplify(f)
    print(f"Objective function in terms of x: {f}")
    
    # Find critical points by taking derivative
    df = sp.diff(f, x)
    critical_points = sp.solve(df, x)
    print(f"Critical point(s): {critical_points}")
    
    # Evaluate function at critical point
    min_value = f.subs(x, critical_points[0])
    print(f"Minimum value: {min_value}")

find_min_value()
