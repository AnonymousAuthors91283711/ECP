  (olympiadbench1818_answer n) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing n=2
Trying k=1
Found valid coloring with k=1
Trying k=2
Found valid coloring with k=2
Trying k=3
Found valid coloring with k=3
Trying k=4
Found valid coloring with k=4
Testing n=3
Trying k=1
No valid coloring possible for k=1 (since k < n)
Trying k=2
No valid coloring possible for k=2 (since k < n)
Trying k=3
Likely valid coloring exists for k=3 (not fully checked)
Trying k=4
Likely valid coloring exists for k=4 (not fully checked)
Trying k=5
Likely valid coloring exists for k=5 (not fully checked). Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
