This problem involves finding a function f:ℝ→ℝ and a polynomial P that satisfy certain conditions. We'll enumerate possible polynomial candidates (focusing on low-degree polynomials with non-negative coefficients) and function forms (likely linear) that satisfy the given functional equation.

The approach will:
1. Test polynomials P of degree 0,1,2 with non-negative coefficients and P(0)=0
2. For each P, test linear functions f(x) = kx + c that satisfy the conditions
3. Check the functional equation for sample positive x,y values

```python
import numpy as np

def test_candidate(k, c, P_coeffs, x, y):
    """Test if f(x) = kx + c and P satisfy the functional equation for given x,y"""
    if x <= y or y <= 0:
        return False
    
    P = np.poly1d(P_coeffs)
    f = lambda z: k*z + c
    
    lhs = f(f(x) + P(y))
    rhs = f(x - y) + 2*y
    return abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-6

    # Test different polynomial degrees (0,1,2)

        # Generate all non-negative coefficient combinations with P(0)=0
        max_coeff = 3
        coeff_ranges = [(0, max_coeff)] * degree + [(0, 0)]  # constant term must be 0
        
        from itertools import product
        for coeffs in product(*[range(a, b+1) for a, b in coeff_ranges]):
            if not coeffs:  # degree 0 case
                coeffs = (0,)
            P_coeffs = coeffs[::-1]  # numpy uses highest degree first
