Based on the error messages and enumerated answers, the issue is with the syntax for defining the set of constant functions where the constant divides 2. The errors indicate we need to properly specify the type and use the correct divisibility notation for natural numbers.

The enumerated answers show that constant functions (particularly f(n) = 1) satisfy the condition. The pattern suggests we should consider all constant functions where the constant divides 2 (which would be 1 and 2, since 0 would not satisfy the condition for all a,b).

Here's the corrected version:

<<<{f : ℕ → ℕ | ∃ c : ℕ, f = (fun _ => c) ∧ c ∣ 2}>>>

Explanation:
1. Added explicit type annotation `: ℕ → ℕ` for the function
2. Added explicit type annotation `: ℕ` for the constant c
3. Used proper function notation `(fun _ => c)` with parentheses
4. Used natural number divisibility `c ∣ 2` in the correct context

This defines the set of all constant functions from ℕ to ℕ where the constant value divides 2. The enumerated answers confirm that f(n) = 1 works, and since 1 divides 2, it would be included in this set. The other possible constant would be f(n) = 2, which also satisfies 2 ∣ 2.
