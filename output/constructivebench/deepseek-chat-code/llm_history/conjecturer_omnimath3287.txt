  omnimath3287_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No valid digit set found. Expected Answer Type: Prop
<<<True>>> 

Explanation: The problem asks if there exists a 3-digit set that can form 16 distinct 3-digit numbers with specific properties. The enumeration shows no such set exists, so the answer is True (no solution exists). The negative existential is equivalent to a universal statement that no such digits satisfy the conditions.
