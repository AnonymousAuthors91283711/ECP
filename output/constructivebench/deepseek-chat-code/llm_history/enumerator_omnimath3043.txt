[write_program]
This problem is a simple equation to solve for `omnimath3043_answer`. The equation is `4 + x = 14 - x`. We can solve it algebraically by adding `x` to both sides and subtracting 4 from both sides to get `2x = 10`, so `x = 5`. However, since the task is to write a Python program to enumerate possible answers, we'll iterate through possible values of x until we find one that satisfies the equation.

```python
def find_answer():
    # Iterate possible values of x from 0 upwards
    for x in range(0, 100):  # Reasonable upper bound
        if 4 + x == 14 - x:
            print(f"Found solution: {x}")
            return
    print("No solution found in range")

find_answer()
