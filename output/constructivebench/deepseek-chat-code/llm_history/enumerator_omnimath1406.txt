[write_program]
This problem asks for the prime number p such that for some prime q, both p+q and p+7q are perfect squares. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible primes p and q, checking these conditions.

The approach:
1. Generate small prime numbers p and q
2. Check if p+q and p+7q are perfect squares
3. Print any valid pairs found
4. Since the theorem suggests there's exactly one such p, we'll stop after finding it

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def is_square(n):
    root = int(math.sqrt(n))
    return root * root == n

max_p = 1000  # Reasonable upper bound for demonstration
primes = [p for p in range(2, max_p) if is_prime(p)]

found = False
for p in primes:
    for q in primes:
        sum1 = p + q
        sum2 = p + 7 * q
        if is_square(sum1) and is_square(sum2):
            print(f"Found valid pair: p={p}, q={q}")
            print(f"p+q = {sum1} = {int(math.sqrt(sum1))}^2")
            print(f"p+7q = {sum2} = {int(math.sqrt(sum2))}^2")
            found = True
            break
    if found:
        break
```
