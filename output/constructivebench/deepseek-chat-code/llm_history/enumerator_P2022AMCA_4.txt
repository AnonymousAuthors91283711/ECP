[write_program]
This problem asks for a unique natural number n that satisfies four conditions:
1. n > 0
2. LCM(n, 18) = 180
3. GCD(n, 45) = 15
4. The sum of its decimal digits equals some answer (which we need to find)

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible n values that satisfy the first three conditions, then calculate their digit sums to find the unique solution.

```python
import math

def find_candidates():
    # Condition 1: LCM(n, 18) = 180
    # LCM(a,b) = a*b/GCD(a,b) => n*18/GCD(n,18) = 180 => n/GCD(n,18) = 10
    # So n must be a multiple of 10, but not necessarily divisible by 10
    # Actually, n must be divisible by 10 since GCD(n,18) must be n/10
    
    # Condition 2: GCD(n, 45) = 15
    # So n must be divisible by 15 but not by 45
    
    max_n = 1000  # Reasonable upper bound
    candidates = []
    
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        if (math.lcm(n, 18) == 180 and 
            math.gcd(n, 45) == 15):
            candidates.append(n)
    
    return candidates

def main():
    candidates = find_candidates()
    print("Candidates satisfying conditions 1-3:", candidates)
    
    for n in candidates:
        digit_sum = sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
        print(f"n = {n}, digit sum = {digit_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
