This problem appears to be about finding real values of p for which a certain polynomial Q(p) has three distinct real roots. Since we don't have the specific polynomial Q(p), I'll create a program that can handle a general cubic polynomial and find parameter values where it has three distinct real roots.

The program will:
1. Use a sample cubic polynomial x³ + a x² + b x + c
2. Find parameter ranges where the discriminant is positive (indicating three real roots)
3. Check for distinctness of roots

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.polynomial import Polynomial

def find_p_with_three_roots():
    # Sample parameters for a general cubic polynomial x³ + a x² + b x + c
    # We'll vary 'a' and find corresponding 'b' and 'c' that give three real roots
    for a in np.linspace(-5, 5, 11):  # Sample a values
        # For a cubic x³ + a x² + b x + c, discriminant D = 18abc - 4a³c + a²b² - 4b³ - 27c²
        # For three real roots, D > 0
        # We'll find b values that could potentially give D > 0
        for b in np.linspace(-5, 5, 11):
            # Find c range that makes discriminant positive
            # Using the discriminant formula for cubic
            discriminant = lambda c: 18*a*b*c - 4*a**3*c + a**2*b**2 - 4*b**3 - 27*c**2
            # Find c where discriminant > 0
            for c in np.linspace(-5, 5, 101):
                if discriminant(c) > 0:
                    p = Polynomial([c, b, a, 1])
                    roots = p.roots()
                    real_roots = [r for r in roots if np.isreal(r)]
                    real_roots = np.real(real_roots)
                    if len(real_roots) >= 3:
                        # Check if roots are distinct
                        unique_roots = np.unique(real_roots.round(decimals=5))
                        if len(unique_roots) >= 3:
                            print(f"For polynomial x³ + {a:.2f}x² + {b:.2f}x + {c:.2f}:")
                            print(f"Roots: {unique_roots}")
                            print("---")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_p_with_three_roots()
```

Note: This program uses a sampling approach to find parameter values where a cubic polynomial has three distinct real roots. The actual problem likely involves a specific polynomial Q(p), but since it wasn't provided, this general approach demonstrates the methodology. The program checks the discriminant condition and verifies root distinctness numerically. For an exact solution, symbolic computation would be needed.
