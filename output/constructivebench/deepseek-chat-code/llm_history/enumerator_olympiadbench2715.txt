[write_program]
This problem asks to find all real numbers x where the floor function difference ⌊x/2⌋ - ⌊x/3⌋ equals x/7, and then sum all such x. We'll write a Python program to find these values numerically within a reasonable range.

Key observations:
1. The equation involves floor functions, so solutions will likely be integers or lie between integer points
2. We can limit our search to positive numbers since for x<0, the floor differences grow negatively while x/7 grows positively
3. For x > 42, x/7 > 6, but the maximum floor difference is ⌊x/2⌋ - ⌊x/3⌋ ≤ x/2 - (x/3 - 1) = x/6 + 1, which grows slower than x/7

```python
def find_solutions():
    solutions = []
    # Check integer candidates first since floor functions change at integers
    for x in range(0, 43):
        lhs = (x // 2) - (x // 3)
        rhs = x / 7
        if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-9:  # Account for floating point precision
            solutions.append(x)
    
    # Check non-integer ranges where floor values remain constant
    for k in range(0, 7):
        # x in [2k, 2k+2) for ⌊x/2⌋=k
        for m in range(0, 5):
            # x in [3m, 3m+3) for ⌊x/3⌋=m
            # Find overlap intervals where both floor values are constant
            lower = max(2*k, 3*m)
            upper = min(2*k+2, 3*m+3)
            if lower >= upper:
                continue
            
            # Solve k - m = x/7 in this interval
            x_candidate = 7 * (k - m)
            if lower <= x_candidate < upper:
                solutions.append(x_candidate)
    
    # Remove duplicates and sort
    solutions = sorted(list(set(solutions)))
    return solutions

solutions = find_solutions()
print("Found solutions:", solutions)
print("Sum of solutions:", sum(solutions))
```
