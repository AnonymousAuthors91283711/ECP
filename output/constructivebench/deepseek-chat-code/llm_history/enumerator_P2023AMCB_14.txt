This problem asks for the number of integer pairs (a,b) such that the polynomial x³ + a x² + b x + 6 has three distinct integer roots. We'll enumerate all possible triples of distinct integer roots (r,s,t) whose product is -6 (from Vieta's formulas), then count the unique (a,b) pairs formed by -(r+s+t) and (rs+rt+st).

```python
from itertools import combinations

def find_pairs():
    seen = set()
    # Generate all ordered triples of distinct integers with product -6
    factors = [n for d in [1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, 6, -6] for n in [d, -d] if 6 % abs(d) == 0]
    factors = list(set(factors))  # Remove duplicates
    
    for r, s, t in combinations(factors, 3):
        if r * s * t != -6:
            continue
        a = -(r + s + t)
        b = r*s + r*t + s*t
        seen.add((a, b))
    
    # Also check permutations with negative signs
    for r, s in combinations(factors, 2):
        t = -6 // (r * s)
        if t == r or t == s:
            continue
        a = -(r + s + t)
        b = r*s + r*t + s*t
        seen.add((a, b))
    
    print("Found pairs:", sorted(seen))
    print("Total count:", len(seen))
