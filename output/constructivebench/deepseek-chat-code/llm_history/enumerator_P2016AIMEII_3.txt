[write_program]
This problem involves finding the sum of absolute values of logarithmic expressions given certain conditions. We'll write a Python program to verify the conditions and compute the required sum.

The key steps are:
1. Given the conditions, we can express x, y, z in terms of powers of 5
2. Verify that x*y*z = 1
3. Compute the sum of absolute values of the given logarithmic ratios

```python
import math

# Given conditions
logx_log5 = 100
logy_log5 = -60
logz_log5 = 20

# Compute the sum of absolute values
sum_abs = abs(logx_log5) + abs(logy_log5) + abs(logz_log5)

# Verify x*y*z = 1 by converting to powers of 5
x = 5 ** logx_log5
y = 5 ** logy_log5
z = 5 ** logz_log5
product = x * y * z

# Check if product equals 1 (should be true based on problem statement)
print(f"Verification: x*y*z = {product} (should be 1)")
print(f"Sum of absolute values: {sum_abs}")
```
