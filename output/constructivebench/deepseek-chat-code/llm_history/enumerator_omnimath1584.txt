[write_program]
The problem involves solving three equations for x, y, z respectively, then summing them. The equations are:
1. 7x/5 + 16 = x
2. (7y - 80)/9 = (9y/5 + 32)
3. z = 9z/5 + 32

We'll write a Python program to solve each equation symbolically (as exact fractions) and compute their sum.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Solve 7x/5 + 16 = x
x = Fraction(-16, (Fraction(7,5) - 1))

# Solve (7y - 80)/9 = (9y/5 + 32)
# Multiply both sides by 45 to eliminate denominators
# 5(7y - 80) = 9(9y + 160)
# 35y - 400 = 81y + 1440
# -400 - 1440 = 81y - 35y
# -1840 = 46y
y = Fraction(-1840, 46)

# Solve z = 9z/5 + 32
z = Fraction(-32, (Fraction(9,5) - 1))

# Print each solution and their sum
print(f"x = {x} ({float(x)})")
print(f"y = {y} ({float(y)})")
print(f"z = {z} ({float(z)})")
print(f"x + y + z = {x + y + z} ({float(x + y + z)})")
```
