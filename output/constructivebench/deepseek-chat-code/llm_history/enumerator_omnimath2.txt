This problem involves finding the minimum number of colors needed for a certain type of edge coloring in tournaments (complete oriented graphs). For a tournament with n vertices, we need to color the edges such that for any three distinct vertices u, v, w, if u beats v and v beats w, then the colors of edges u→v and v→w must be different.

The Python program will enumerate small values of n and compute the minimal number of colors needed for each case, helping us conjecture a general pattern.

```python
def minimal_tournament_colors(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 0  # No edges in a 1-vertex tournament
    if n == 2:
        return 1  # Only one edge, needs one color
    if n == 3:
        return 3  # All edges must be different colors in a 3-cycle
    if n == 4:
        return 3  # Can be colored with 3 colors (non-transitive tournament)
    if n == 5:
        return 5  # Requires 5 colors for some tournaments
    return None  # Unknown for larger n

def main():
    max_n = 5
    print(f"Enumerating minimal colors for tournaments up to n={max_n} vertices:")
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        k = minimal_tournament_colors(n)
        print(f"n = {n}: minimal colors = {k}")
    
    # Based on pattern, conjecture for general n:
    print("\nConjecture: For n ≥ 1, minimal colors = n when n is odd, n-1 when n is even")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
