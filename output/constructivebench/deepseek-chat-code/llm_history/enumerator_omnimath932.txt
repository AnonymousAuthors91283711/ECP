This problem involves finding the value of a polynomial P evaluated at 1, given a specific polynomial equation. The equation states that (20X²⁷ + 2X² + 1) multiplied by P equals 2001X²⁰⁰¹. We need to find P(1).

The key insight is that P can be determined by polynomial division. The value P(1) can be found by evaluating the quotient at X=1. We'll write a program to compute this by:
1. Representing the polynomials numerically
2. Performing polynomial division
3. Evaluating the result at X=1

```python
def main():
    # Represent numerator as coefficients: 2001 * X^2001
    numerator = [0] * 2002
    numerator[2001] = 2001
    
    # Represent denominator coefficients: 20X^27 + 2X^2 + 1
    denominator = [0] * 28
    denominator[0] = 1
    denominator[2] = 2
    denominator[27] = 20
    
    # Perform polynomial division (simplified since denominator is monic in highest term)
    quotient = [0] * (2001 - 27 + 1)
    remainder = numerator.copy()
    
    for i in range(len(quotient)-1, -1, -1):
        if remainder[27 + i] == 0:
            continue
        coeff = remainder[27 + i] / denominator[27]
        quotient[i] = coeff
        for j in range(28):
            remainder[i + j] -= coeff * denominator[j]
    
    # Evaluate quotient at X=1 (sum of coefficients)
    p_at_1 = sum(quotient)
    print(f"P(1) = {p_at_1}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
