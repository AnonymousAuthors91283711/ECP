This problem involves computing a product of complex numbers related to roots of unity modulo 1000. We'll approach it by:
1. Understanding the product involves roots of unity ω where ω^13=1
2. Evaluating the expression (2 - 2ω^k + ω^(2k)) for each k
3. Finding the product of these terms
4. Taking modulo 1000 of the final result

Since exact computation with complex roots is challenging, we'll use Python's complex number support and approximations, being careful about rounding errors.

```python
import cmath
import math

def main():
    n = 13
    # Compute primitive 13th root of unity
    omega = cmath.exp(2j * math.pi / n)
    
    product = 1
    for k in range(n):
        term = 2 - 2 * omega**k + omega**(2*k)
        product *= term
    
    # Round to nearest integer to handle floating point errors
    result = round(product.real)
    mod_result = result % 1000
    print(f"Product: {result}")
    print(f"Mod 1000: {mod_result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
