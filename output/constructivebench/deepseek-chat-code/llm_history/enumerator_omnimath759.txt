[write_program]
This problem asks for the largest integer n ≤ 200 that minimizes the absolute difference between n and X, where X is defined as (3 + (107 + 99*n)/(2*100)) for all k ≤ 200. We'll write a Python program to find this value by:

1. Calculating X for each n
2. Finding the absolute difference between n and X
3. Tracking the n that gives the smallest difference
4. Among ties, selecting the largest n

```python
def main():
    min_diff = float('inf')
    best_n = 0
    
    for n in range(201):  # Check n from 0 to 200
        numerator = 107 + 99 * n
        X = 3 + numerator / 200  # 2*100 = 200
        current_diff = abs(n - X)
        
        if current_diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = current_diff
            best_n = n
        elif current_diff == min_diff and n > best_n:
            best_n = n
    
    print(f"Best n found: {best_n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
