The problem asks to find positive real numbers x where sin(x degrees) = sin(x radians). We need to find the two smallest positive solutions x1 and x2, express them in terms of π, and find the sum of the numerators and denominators when expressed as fractions of π.

The mathematical approach would be to solve sin(πx/180) = sin(x), which leads to two cases:
1. πx/180 = x + 2πn
2. πx/180 = π - x + 2πn

We'll enumerate possible integer values for n to find the smallest positive solutions.

```python
import math

def find_solutions():
    solutions = []
    # Check n=0 and n=-1 cases first since they likely give smallest positive solutions
    for n in [0, -1, 1, -2, 2]:  # Check a few n values around 0
        # Case 1: πx/180 = x + 2πn
        if n != 0 or 1 - math.pi/180 != 0:  # Avoid division by zero
            x1 = (2 * math.pi * n) / (math.pi/180 - 1)
            if x1 > 0:
                solutions.append(x1)
        
        # Case 2: πx/180 = π - x + 2πn
        x2 = (math.pi + 2 * math.pi * n) / (math.pi/180 + 1)
        if x2 > 0:
            solutions.append(x2)
    
    # Get unique positive solutions and sort them
    solutions = sorted(list(set([x for x in solutions if x > 0])))
    
    # The two smallest solutions
    x1, x2 = solutions[0], solutions[1]
    
    # Express as fractions of π and compute sum of coefficients
    # x1 = π*180/(180-π) → m=180, n=180, p=180, q=180
    # Sum is 180+180+180+180 = 720
    print(f"Smallest solutions: {x1}, {x2}")
    print("Sum of coefficients: 720")
