[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of linear equations with given constants. We'll write a Python program to solve for x and y, then compute the expression 20x + 14y. The program will handle the exact values symbolically to avoid floating-point approximations.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve_problem():
    T = Fraction(40)
    # Equation 1: x + 9y = 17
    # Equation 2: T*x + (T+1)*y = T + 2
    
    # Solve equation 1 for x: x = 17 - 9y
    # Substitute into equation 2:
    # T*(17 - 9y) + (T+1)*y = T + 2
    # 17T - 9T*y + T*y + y = T + 2
    # 17T - 8T*y + y = T + 2
    # y*(1 - 8T) = T + 2 - 17T
    # y = (2 - 16T)/(1 - 8T)
    
    numerator = 2 - 16*T
    denominator = 1 - 8*T
    y = numerator / denominator
    
    x = 17 - 9*y
    
    # Compute 20x + 14y
    result = 20*x + 14*y
    
    print(f"x = {x}")
    print(f"y = {y}")
    print(f"20x + 14y = {result}")
