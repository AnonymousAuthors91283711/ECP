Ground Truth Answer: {π/6, 5*π/6, π/4, 3*π/4}
Proposed Answer: {θ | θ ∈ Icc 0 (2*π) ∧ (θ = π/6 ∨ θ = π/4 ∨ θ = 3*π/4 ∨ θ = 5*π/6)}
<<<True>>>

The proposed answer correctly lists all the angles within the interval [0, 2π] that satisfy the given equation, matching exactly with the ground truth answer. The set notation used in the proposed answer is equivalent to explicitly listing the elements as in the ground truth answer. Both forms represent the same solution set.
