This problem is a simple linear equation where we need to find the value of k that satisfies the equation 2k + 1 = 4k - 5. The solution can be found by solving for k algebraically. We'll write a Python program that demonstrates the solution process and verifies the answer.

```python
def solve_equation():
    # The equation is: 2k + 1 = 4k - 5
    # Let's solve for k step by step
    print("Solving equation: 2k + 1 = 4k - 5")
    
    # Subtract 2k from both sides
    print("Step 1: Subtract 2k from both sides")
    print("1 = 2k - 5")
    
    # Add 5 to both sides
    print("Step 2: Add 5 to both sides")
    print("6 = 2k")
    
    # Divide both sides by 2
    print("Step 3: Divide both sides by 2")
    k = 6 / 2
    print(f"k = {k}")
    
    # Verification
    print("\nVerification:")
    left_side = 2 * k + 1
    right_side = 4 * k - 5
    print(f"Left side (2k + 1): {left_side}")
    print(f"Right side (4k - 5): {right_side}")
    print(f"Both sides equal: {left_side == right_side}")
