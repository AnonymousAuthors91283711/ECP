[write_program]
The problem asks for the smallest natural number n such that any multiset of size n with elements from {0,1,2} either contains at least 3 copies of one element, or contains at least one copy of each distinct element. This is similar to the pigeonhole principle but with more conditions.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible multisets of increasing sizes and check the conditions, stopping when we find the smallest n that satisfies the requirement for all multisets of that size.

```python
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement

def check_condition(multiset):
    counts = {}
    for x in multiset:
        counts[x] = counts.get(x, 0) + 1
    # Check if any count >= 3
    if any(v >= 3 for v in counts.values()):
        return True
    # Check if all three elements present
    if len(counts) == 3:
        return True
    return False

def find_min_n():
    n = 1
    while True:
        all_valid = True
        # Generate all multisets of size n with elements 0,1,2
        for multiset in combinations_with_replacement([0,1,2], n):
            if not check_condition(multiset):
                all_valid = False
                break
        if all_valid:
            print(f"Found minimal n: {n}")
            return n
        else:
            print(f"n = {n} doesn't work")
            n += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_n()
```
