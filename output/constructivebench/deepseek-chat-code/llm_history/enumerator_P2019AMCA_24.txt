[write_program]
This problem asks for the count of numbers n between 1 and 50 where (n²)! is divisible by (n!)^n. We'll write a Python program to check this condition for each n from 1 to 50.

The key observation is that (n²)! must contain at least as many prime factors as (n!)^n. We'll compute this by:
1. For each n from 1 to 50
2. Check if for every prime p ≤ n, the exponent of p in (n²)! is ≥ n times its exponent in n!
3. Count all n where this holds true

```python
import math
from collections import defaultdict

def prime_factors(n):
    factors = defaultdict(int)
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors[2] += 1
        n = n // 2
    i = 3
    while i * i <= n:
        while n % i == 0:
            factors[i] += 1
            n = n // i
        i += 2
    if n > 2:
        factors[n] += 1
    return factors

def legendre(n, p):
    count = 0
    power = p
    while power <= n:
        count += n // power
        power *= p
    return count

count = 0
for n in range(1, 51):
    valid = True
    # Get all primes <= n
    primes = set()
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        if all(i % p != 0 for p in primes):
            primes.add(i)
    
    for p in primes:
        exp_n_fact = legendre(n, p)
        exp_n_sq_fact = legendre(n*n, p)
        if exp_n_sq_fact < n * exp_n_fact:
            valid = False
            break
    
    if valid:
        print(n)
        count += 1

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
