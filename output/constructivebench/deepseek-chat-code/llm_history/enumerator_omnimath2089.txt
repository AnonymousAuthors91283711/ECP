[write_program]
This problem is about finding the maximum size of a subset S of functions from Fin 2 → Fin 5 (essentially pairs of numbers from 0-4) such that no four distinct functions in S satisfy the given condition about their components. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible subset sizes and check the condition.

The approach:
1. Represent functions as tuples (a,b) where a,b ∈ {0,1,2,3,4}
2. Systematically check all possible subsets of increasing size
3. For each subset size, check all combinations of 4 elements to see if they violate the condition
4. Output the largest size where no violation occurs

```python
from itertools import combinations, product

def is_violating(a, b, c, d):
    # Check if a,b,c,d satisfy the forbidden condition
    return (a[0] == c[0] and b[0] == d[0] and a[1] == b[1] and c[1] == d[1])

def max_subset_size():
    # All possible functions Fin 2 → Fin 5
    elements = list(product(range(5), repeat=2))
    max_size = 0
    
    # We'll try increasing subset sizes
    for size in range(1, 26):
        found = False
        # Check all possible subsets of current size
        for subset in combinations(elements, size):
            valid = True
            # Check all 4-tuples in the subset
            for quad in combinations(subset, 4):
                if is_violating(*quad):
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                max_size = size
                print(f"Found valid subset of size {size}")
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            break
    
    print(f"Maximum subset size found: {max_size}")

max_subset_size()
```
