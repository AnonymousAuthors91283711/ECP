[write_program]
This problem is a simple arithmetic subtraction problem. The task is to compute 943 - 87. While trivial for humans, we'll write a Python program that verifies this computation programmatically.

The program will:
1. Perform the subtraction 943 - 87
2. Print the result immediately
3. Since this is a single computation, there's no need for enumeration or thresholds

```python
# Simple program to compute 943 - 87
result = 943 - 87
print(result)
```
