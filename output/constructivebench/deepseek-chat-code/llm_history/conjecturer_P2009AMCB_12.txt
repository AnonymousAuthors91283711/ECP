. Enumerated Answers: a = 157.5 (exact: 157.5). Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the problem statement and the enumerated answer, we need to find the initial term 'a' of a geometric sequence where:
1. The 5th term is 7! (5040)
2. The 8th term is 8! (40320)

The general form is geometric n = a * r^n. From the given terms:
1. a * r^5 = 5040
2. a * r^8 = 40320

Dividing the second equation by the first gives r^3 = 40320/5040 = 8, so r = 2.

Substituting back into the first equation: a * 2^5 = 5040 → a = 5040/32 = 157.5

The proposed answer was unnecessarily complex and caused Lean compilation issues. The correct closed form is much simpler.

<<<157.5>>>
