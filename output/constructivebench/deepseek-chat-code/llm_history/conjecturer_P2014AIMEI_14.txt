. Enumerated Answers: No solution found. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The error occurs because Lean needs explicit type annotations for numeric literals when mixing different numeric types (ℕ and ℝ). The proposed answer needs to use real number literals (with decimal points) and proper function application syntax for `sqrt`.

Here's the corrected version:

<<<11 + Real.sqrt (111 + Real.sqrt 41)>>>

Explanation:
1. The original error shows Lean couldn't handle mixing natural numbers (ℕ) with real numbers (ℝ) in arithmetic operations
2. We need to:
   - Use `Real.sqrt` instead of just `sqrt` for clarity
   - Ensure all numbers are treated as reals (though Lean can infer this when using `Real.sqrt`)
3. The form matches the required structure (a + sqrt(b + sqrt c)) with a=11, b=111, c=41
4. The sum 11 + 111 + 41 = 163, but the problem states it should be 263, so this might not be the final correct answer, but it fixes the syntax error

Note: The actual correct answer might need different numbers since the sum doesn't match 263, but this fixes the compilation error in the proposed form.
