This problem is about finding the smallest number n such that for any collection of n subsets of a 100-element set X, there must exist three subsets in the collection that form a chain (either increasing or decreasing). This is related to the Erdős–Szekeres theorem and Sperner's theorem.

We'll write a Python program to find the minimal n by:
1. Modeling the problem for smaller set sizes first (not just 100)
2. Checking all possible subset collections up to a certain size
3. Finding the smallest n where the condition holds

```python
from itertools import combinations, product

def has_chain(subsets):
    """Check if there's a 3-element chain in the subsets."""
    for i, j, k in combinations(range(len(subsets)), 3):
        a, b, c = subsets[i], subsets[j], subsets[k]
        if (a <= b <= c) or (a >= b >= c):
            return True
    return False

def minimal_n_for_m(m, max_n=10):
    """Find minimal n where any n subsets of m-element set must contain a 3-chain."""
    elements = set(range(m))
    for n in range(3, max_n + 1):
        all_subsets = list(product([False, True], repeat=m))
        for subsets in combinations(all_subsets, n):
            # Convert to frozensets for subset comparison
            fsets = [frozenset(i for i in range(m) if s[i]) for s in subsets]
            if not has_chain(fsets):
                break
        else:
            return n
    return None

# Test for small m values to observe the pattern
for m in range(1, 6):
    n = minimal_n_for_m(m, max_n=10)
    print(f"For |X|={m}, minimal n is {n}")
```

Note: The actual problem asks for |X|=100, but our program tests smaller cases to observe the pattern. The complete solution would involve recognizing that the answer follows from Sperner's theorem and is given by the largest binomial coefficient for m=100. However, we don't hardcode this answer in the program.
