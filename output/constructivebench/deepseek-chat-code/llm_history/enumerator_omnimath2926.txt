[write_program]
The problem is to find the smallest natural number `n` such that `1/2 < n/9`. This translates to finding the smallest integer `n` where `n > 4.5`, which is `n = 5`. The Python program will enumerate natural numbers starting from 1 and check the condition, stopping at the first valid answer.

```python
def find_min_n():
    for n in range(1, 10):  # We know the answer is <=9 since 9/9=1>1/2
        if n / 9 > 1 / 2:
            print(f"Found valid n: {n}")
            print(f"Minimum n satisfying the condition: {n}")
            return
    print("No valid n found in range")

find_min_n()
```
