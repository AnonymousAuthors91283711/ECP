Based on the functional equations and the given conditions, we can conjecture that the solution involves linear functions. The equations suggest symmetry between f and g, and the second equation hints at a relationship where f(x) = g(x) = x + 1 satisfies the second condition. Testing this with the first equation confirms it works. Therefore, the solution is:

<<<fun x : ℝ => (x + 1, x + 1)>>>
