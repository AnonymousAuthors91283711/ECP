[write_program]
This problem involves finding an integer `a` that satisfies three conditions related to averages and ranges of sequences. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of `a` by checking the conditions systematically.

The approach:
1. For condition h₁, `a` must be the average of three consecutive multiples of 3
2. For condition h₂, `a+27` must be the average of four consecutive multiples of 4
3. For condition h₃, the average of min and max of the combined seven numbers must be 42

We'll iterate through possible values of `k` and `m` to find valid `a` values that satisfy all conditions.

```python
def main():
    # We'll search within a reasonable range around the expected values
    for k in range(-50, 51):
        # Calculate a from condition h₁
        three_nums = [3*k, 3*(k+1), 3*(k+2)]
        a = sum(three_nums) // 3
        
        # Check condition h₂: a+27 must be average of 4 consecutive multiples of 4
        target = a + 27
        for m in range(-50, 51):
            four_nums = [4*m, 4*(m+1), 4*(m+2), 4*(m+3)]
            if sum(four_nums) // 4 == target:
                # Check condition h₃: (min + max)/2 = 42 for combined list
                combined = three_nums + four_nums
                min_val = min(combined)
                max_val = max(combined)
                if (min_val + max_val) // 2 == 42:
                    print(f"Found candidate: a = {a} (k={k}, m={m})")
    
    print("Enumeration complete.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
