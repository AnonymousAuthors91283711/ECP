This problem asks for all integers c such that there exist integers a and b satisfying the system:
1. a + b*c = 2017
2. b + c*a = 8

We'll solve the system symbolically and enumerate possible integer values of c that make the system solvable in integers a and b.

```python
def solve():
    # We'll iterate through possible c values that could make the system solvable
    # From equation 1: a = 2017 - b*c
    # Substitute into equation 2: b + c*(2017 - b*c) = 8
    # Which simplifies to: b + 2017*c - b*c² = 8
    # Rearranged: b(1 - c²) = 8 - 2017*c
    # So b = (8 - 2017*c)/(1 - c²)
    
    # We'll test c values where 1 - c² divides 8 - 2017*c
    # The denominator grows quadratically, so we can limit our search
    
    solutions = []
    max_c = 100  # Large enough to cover all possible solutions
    
    for c in range(-max_c, max_c + 1):
        denominator = 1 - c*c
        if denominator == 0:
            continue  # Division by zero
        numerator = 8 - 2017*c
        if numerator % denominator != 0:
            continue
        b = numerator // denominator
        a = 2017 - b * c
        # Verify both equations
        if (a + b * c == 2017) and (b + c * a == 8):
            solutions.append(c)
            print(f"Found solution: c = {c} (a = {a}, b = {b})")
    
    print("All solutions found:", sorted(solutions))
