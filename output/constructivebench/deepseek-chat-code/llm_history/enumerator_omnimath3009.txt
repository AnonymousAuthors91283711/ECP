This problem involves solving a system of equations to find the maximum of four natural numbers a, b, c, d. We'll solve the system of equations first, then find the maximum value among the variables.

The approach is:
1. Convert the given equations into a system of linear equations
2. Solve for each variable
3. Find the maximum value among the four variables

```python
def solve_omnimath3009():
    # The system of equations from the problem can be written as:
    # (1) a + b + c = 96
    # (2) a + b + d = 117
    # (3) a + c + d = 120
    # (4) b + c + d = 132
    
    # Subtract equation (1) from (2) to get d - c = 21
    # Subtract equation (1) from (3) to get d - b = 24
    # Subtract equation (1) from (4) to get d - a = 36
    
    # Let's express all variables in terms of d
    a = d - 36
    b = d - 24
    c = d - 21
    
    # Substitute into equation (1): (d-36) + (d-24) + (d-21) = 96
    # Simplifies to 3d - 81 = 96 => 3d = 177 => d = 59
    
    # Now compute all variables
    d = 59
    a = d - 36
    b = d - 24
    c = d - 21
    
    # Calculate the values
    a_val = 59 - 36
    b_val = 59 - 24
    c_val = 59 - 21
    d_val = 59
    
    # Find the maximum
    max_val = max(a_val, b_val, c_val, d_val)
    
    # Print all values and the maximum
    print(f"a = {a_val}, b = {b_val}, c = {c_val}, d = {d_val}")
    print(f"Maximum value: {max_val}")

[refine_program]
Judgement:
The original program is rejected because it doesn't follow the required output format and doesn't stream partial results. The problem asks for the maximum value among a, b, c, d, but the program prints all values and then the maximum at the end. Additionally, the program doesn't show the step-by-step solving process as required by the streaming partial results requirement.

The program should:
1. Show the intermediate steps (equations being solved)
2. Print each variable's value as it's determined
3. Finally output the maximum value explicitly

<<<False>>>

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def solve_omnimath3009():
    print("Solving the system of equations:")
    print("(1) a + b + c = 96")
    print("(2) a + b + d = 117")
    print("(3) a + c + d = 120")
    print("(4) b + c + d = 132")
    
    print("\nSubtracting equation (1) from others:")
    print("From (2)-(1): d - c = 21")
    print("From (3)-(1): d - b = 24")
    print("From (4)-(1): d - a = 36")
    
    print("\nExpressing variables in terms of d:")
    print("a = d - 36")
    print("b = d - 24")
    print("c = d - 21")
    
    print("\nSubstituting into equation (1):")
    print("(d-36) + (d-24) + (d-21) = 96")
    print("3d - 81 = 96 => d = 59")
    
    d = 59
    print(f"\nCalculated d = {d}")
    
    a = d - 36
    print(f"Calculated a = {a}")
    
    b = d - 24
    print(f"Calculated b = {b}")
    
    c = d - 21
    print(f"Calculated c = {c}")
    
    max_val = max(a, b, c, d)
    print(f"\nMaximum value: {max_val}")
