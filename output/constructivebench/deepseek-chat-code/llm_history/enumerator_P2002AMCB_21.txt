[write_program]
This problem involves counting weighted divisibility conditions for numbers from 0 to 2001. We'll write a Python program to compute the sum by checking each number's divisibility by 11, 13, and 14, then applying the given weight function.

```python
def compute_sum():
    total = 0
    for n in range(2002):
        div11 = n % 11 == 0
        div13 = n % 13 == 0
        div14 = n % 14 == 0
        
        if div11 and div13 and div14:
            total += 6
        elif div11 and div13:
            total += 4
        elif div11 and div14:
            total += 3
        elif div13 and div14:
            total += 2
        elif div11:
            total += 1
        elif div13:
            total += 1
        elif div14:
            total += 1
    
    print(total)

compute_sum()
```
