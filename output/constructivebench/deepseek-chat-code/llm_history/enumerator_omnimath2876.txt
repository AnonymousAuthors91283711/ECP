[write_program]
This problem appears to be about finding some function `omnimath2876_answer` that takes two natural numbers `a` and `n` and returns another natural number. The theorem states that when `a=15` and `n=51`, the answer should be 218. 

To help conjecture what this function might be, we'll write a Python program that:
1. Takes small values of a and n (around the given values)
2. Computes possible function outputs that might match the given theorem
3. Prints candidate outputs for inspection

We'll focus on simple arithmetic operations that could produce 218 from 15 and 51.

```python
def compute_candidates(a, n):
    """Compute various arithmetic combinations of a and n that might match the target."""
    candidates = [
        a + n,
        a * n,
        a ** 2 + n,
        a + n ** 2,
        a * n + a + n,
        (a + n) * 2,
        a * (n - a),
        (a + 1) * (n + 1) - 1,
        a * n // gcd(a, n),  # LCM
        a ** 2 - n,
        n ** 2 - a,
        a * n - (a + n),
        (a + n) * (a - n),
        a ** 3 - n ** 2,
    ]
    return sorted(set(candidates))  # remove duplicates

def gcd(x, y):
    """Compute greatest common divisor using Euclidean algorithm."""
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

# Test around the given values
a_values = [14, 15, 16]
n_values = [50, 51, 52]

print("Testing values around a=15, n=51:")
for a in a_values:
    for n in n_values:
        print(f"\na={a}, n={n}:")
        for result in compute_candidates(a, n):
            if 200 <= result <= 250:  # Filter near target value 218
                print(f"  {result}")

# Special case from the theorem
print("\nSpecial case a=15, n=51:")
for result in compute_candidates(15, 51):
    if result == 218:
        print(f"  Found matching result: {result}")
```
