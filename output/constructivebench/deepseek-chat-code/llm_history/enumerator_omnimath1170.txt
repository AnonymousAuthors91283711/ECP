[write_program]
The problem involves evaluating a complex exponential expression with logarithms. We'll write a Python program to compute this expression numerically to help conjecture its exact value. The expression is:

2^((1/6) * ((log2(3)^3 - log2(6)^3 - log2(12)^3 + log2(24)^3)))

We'll compute this using Python's math library for logarithms and powers. The program will calculate and print the numerical value of this expression.

```python
import math

def log2(x):
    return math.log(x, 2)

def compute_expression():
    term1 = log2(3)**3
    term2 = log2(6)**3
    term3 = log2(12)**3
    term4 = log2(24)**3
    exponent = (1/6) * (term1 - term2 - term3 + term4)
    result = 2**exponent
    return result

print(compute_expression())
```
