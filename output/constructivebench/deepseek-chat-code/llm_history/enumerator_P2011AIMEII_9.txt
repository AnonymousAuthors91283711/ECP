[write_program]
This problem involves finding the maximum value of a cyclic sum of triple products under certain constraints. We'll approach it by enumerating possible symmetric configurations that might satisfy the given inequality constraint and compute the corresponding objective value.

The program will:
1. Consider symmetric cases where variables are equal in pairs (x0=x2=x4 and x1=x3=x5)
2. Enumerate possible ratios between these two groups
3. Check the constraint and compute the objective value
4. Output valid configurations and their objective values

```python
def main():
    # We'll consider symmetric cases where x0=x2=x4=a and x1=x3=x5=b
    # The constraint becomes: a^3 + b^3 >= 1/540
    # The sum constraint: 3a + 3b = 1 => a + b = 1/3
    # Objective becomes: 3a^2b + 3ab^2 = 3ab(a + b) = ab (since a+b=1/3)
    
    # We'll parameterize a = t/3, b = (1-t)/3 where t âˆˆ [0,1]
    # Constraint: (t^3 + (1-t)^3)/27 >= 1/540
    # Simplify constraint: t^3 + (1-t)^3 >= 1/20
    
    best_value = 0.0
    best_t = 0.0
    
    # Sample t values in [0,1] with small steps
    for i in range(1001):
        t = i / 1000.0
        # Check constraint
        lhs = t**3 + (1-t)**3
        if lhs >= 1/20:
            a = t / 3
            b = (1-t) / 3
            current_value = a * b  # since 3ab(a+b)=ab when a+b=1/3
            print(f"t={t:.3f}, value={current_value:.6f}")
            if current_value > best_value:
                best_value = current_value
                best_t = t
    
    print(f"\nMaximum value found: {best_value:.6f} at t={best_t:.3f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
