[write_program]
This problem asks to find all pairs (m,n) with m,n â‰¥ 3 such that there are infinitely many positive integers a satisfying the equation a^m + a - 1 = k*(a^n + a^2 - 1) for some integer k. We'll write a program to search for such pairs by testing small values of m and n, and checking if the equation has solutions for multiple a values.

The approach will:
1. Iterate through small m and n values (3-10)
2. For each (m,n) pair, test a range of a values (2-100)
3. Check if (a^m + a - 1) is divisible by (a^n + a^2 - 1)
4. Count how many a values satisfy this condition
5. If many solutions exist, output the (m,n) pair

```python
def compute_pairs(max_m=10, max_n=10, max_a=100):
    results = []
    for m in range(3, max_m + 1):
        for n in range(3, max_n + 1):
            count = 0
            for a in range(2, max_a + 1):
                denominator = a**n + a**2 - 1
                if denominator == 0:
                    continue
                numerator = a**m + a - 1
                if numerator % denominator == 0:
                    count += 1
            if count > 10:  # Arbitrary threshold suggesting many solutions
                print(f"Found pair (m,n) = ({m},{n}) with {count} solutions")
                results.append((m, n))
    print("\nCandidate pairs with many solutions:", results)
