Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Looking at the pattern in the enumerated answers, we can observe that when r approaches 0, S approaches a value that seems to be related to 1/r^2. The minimal S occurs when r is largest possible (|r| < 1), suggesting we should maximize r while satisfying the constraints. The condition a*r = 1 and a/(1-r) = S implies S = 1/(r*(1-r)). To minimize S, we need to maximize r*(1-r), which occurs at r=0.5.
