. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
Looking at the problem and errors, I notice:
1. The equation is x⁴ + (2-x)⁴ = 34
2. The enumerated answers are approximately -0.414..., which matches -1 + √2 ≈ -1 + 1.414 ≈ -0.414
3. The error occurs because Lean needs explicit type annotations for negative numbers in ℝ

The solution set should include both roots of the equation. The proposed answer was correct in form but needed proper real number syntax. We need to:
1. Use Real.sqrt instead of sqrt
2. Explicitly mark numbers as ℝ using (1 : ℝ)
3. Use proper set notation with correct type annotations

Here's the corrected version:

<<<{(-1 : ℝ) + Real.sqrt 2, (-1 : ℝ) - Real.sqrt 2}>>>

Explanation:
The equation simplifies to a quadratic in disguise. Let y = x - 1, then the equation becomes (y+1)⁴ + (1-y)⁴ = 34. Expanding gives 2y⁴ + 12y² + 2 = 34 → y⁴ + 6y² - 16 = 0. Solving this quadratic in y² gives y² = 2, so y = ±√2, hence x = 1 ± √2. However, the enumerated answers show only the negative roots, suggesting we need to consider the original equation's symmetry. The complete solution set includes both positive and negative roots relative to the symmetry point x=1.
