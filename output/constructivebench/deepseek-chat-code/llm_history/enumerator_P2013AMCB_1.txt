[write_program]
The problem asks to find a unique real number `low` such that when we define `high = low + 16`, the average of `high` and `low` equals 3. We need to enumerate possible values to verify the solution.

The mathematical solution would be:
1. (high + low)/2 = 3
2. Substitute high = low + 16
3. (low + 16 + low)/2 = 3 → (2low + 16)/2 = 3 → low + 8 = 3 → low = -5

But since we're asked to enumerate, we'll search around reasonable values to confirm the solution. Here's the Python program:

```python
def find_low():
    # We'll search around a reasonable range since we know the answer is -5
    for low in range(-10, 1):  # Check integers from -10 to 0
        high = low + 16
        average = (high + low) / 2
        if average == 3:
            print(f"Found solution: low = {low}")
            return
    print("No solution found in the tested range")

find_low()
```
