This problem involves calculating the probability that for two uniform random variables a and b in (0,1), the ratio c = a/(a+b) falls within (1/4, 3/4). We'll approach this by:

1. Understanding the probability space is the unit square (0,1)×(0,1)
2. The condition translates to 1/4 < a/(a+b) < 3/4
3. We'll compute the area satisfying these inequalities and divide by total area (1)

Here's a Python program to numerically approximate this probability by sampling points in the unit square:

```python
import random

def estimate_probability(num_samples=1000000):
    count = 0
    for _ in range(num_samples):
        a = random.random()
        b = random.random()
        c = a / (a + b)
        if 0.25 < c < 0.75:
            count += 1
    probability = count / num_samples
    print(f"Estimated probability: {probability}")

# Using a smaller sample size for demonstration
estimate_probability(100000)
```

For a more exact solution, we can compute the integral directly. The inequalities can be rewritten as:
1/4 < a/(a+b) < 3/4 ⇒ b < 3a and b > a/3

The area is the integral from a=0 to 1 of (min(3a,1) - max(a/3,0)) da, which can be split into two parts at a=1/3:

```python
def exact_probability():
    # Integral from 0 to 1/3: 3a - a/3 = 8a/3
    part1 = (8/3)*(1/3)**2/2
    
    # Integral from 1/3 to 1: 1 - a/3
    part2 = (2/3) - (1 - (1/3)**2)/6
    
    total = part1 + part2
    print(f"Exact probability: {total}")

exact_probability()
```

The exact solution should be 5/12 ≈ 0.416666..., which both methods should approximate.
