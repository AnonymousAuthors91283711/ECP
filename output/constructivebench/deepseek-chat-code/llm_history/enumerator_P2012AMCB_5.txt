[write_program]
The problem asks for the minimal number of even numbers among a, b, c, d, e, f given the constraints:
1. a + b = 26
2. a + b + c + d = 41 ⇒ c + d = 15
3. a + b + c + d + e + f = 57 ⇒ e + f = 16

We need to minimize the count of even numbers in the solution. The program will enumerate possible combinations of even/odd parity for these variables under the constraints.

```python
def count_evens(a_parity, b_parity, c_parity, d_parity, e_parity, f_parity):
    return (a_parity + b_parity + c_parity + d_parity + e_parity + f_parity)

min_evens = float('inf')

# a + b = 26 (sum of two numbers is even)
for a_parity in [0, 1]:  # 0=odd, 1=even
    b_parity = (26 % 2) - a_parity  # must sum to even (0 mod 2)
    if b_parity < 0:
        continue
    
    # c + d = 15 (sum is odd)
    for c_parity in [0, 1]:
        d_parity = (15 % 2) - c_parity  # must sum to odd (1 mod 2)
        if d_parity < 0:
            continue
        
        # e + f = 16 (sum is even)
        for e_parity in [0, 1]:
            f_parity = (16 % 2) - e_parity  # must sum to even (0 mod 2)
            if f_parity < 0:
                continue
            
            total = count_evens(a_parity, b_parity, c_parity, d_parity, e_parity, f_parity)
            if total < min_evens:
                min_evens = total
                print(f"New minimum evens found: {min_evens}")

print(f"\nFinal minimal number of even numbers: {min_evens}")
```
