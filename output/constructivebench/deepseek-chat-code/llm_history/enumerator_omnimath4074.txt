[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimal rational constant `c` such that for any finite simple graph `G`, the number of triangles (3-cliques) cubed is at most `c` times the number of edges (2-cliques) to the fourth power. We'll write a Python program to enumerate small graphs and compute the ratio (triangles^3)/(edges^4) to find candidate values for `c`.

The program will:
1. Generate all non-isomorphic graphs up to a small number of vertices (n=5)
2. For each graph, compute the number of edges and triangles
3. Calculate the ratio (triangles^3)/(edges^4), avoiding division by zero
4. Track the maximum ratio found across all graphs
