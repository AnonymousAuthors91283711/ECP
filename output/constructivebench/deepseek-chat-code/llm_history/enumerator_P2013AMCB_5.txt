The problem is to compute the exact value of the expression (33*11 + 55*33)/(33 + 55). This is a straightforward arithmetic calculation that can be done exactly. We'll write a Python program that computes this value exactly as a fraction and then converts it to a simplified form.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Compute numerator and denominator separately
numerator = 33 * 11 + 55 * 33
denominator = 33 + 55

# Compute exact fraction
result = Fraction(numerator, denominator)

# Print simplified fraction and decimal representation
print(f"Exact fraction: {result}")
print(f"Decimal value: {float(result)}")
```
