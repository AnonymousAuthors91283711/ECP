This problem involves solving a system of linear equations to find the value of 8x + y. We'll solve it symbolically by expressing x and y in terms of z, then substituting back to find the constant value.

The approach is:
1. Solve the first equation for x in terms of y and z
2. Substitute into the second equation to find y in terms of z
3. Substitute back to find x in terms of z
4. Compute 8x + y and show it's constant

Here's the Python program that verifies this by testing with different z values:

```python
def solve_system():
    # Test with different z values to verify 8x + y is constant
    test_z_values = [-2, 0, 1, 3, 5]
    
    for z in test_z_values:
        # Solve the system for current z
        # From equation 1: x = 7 - 2y + 3z
        # Substitute into equation 2:
        # 2(7 - 2y + 3z) - y + 2z = 6
        # 14 - 4y + 6z - y + 2z = 6
        # -5y + 8z = -8
        # y = (8z + 8)/5
        y = (8*z + 8)/5
        x = 7 - 2*y + 3*z
        
        # Compute 8x + y
        result = 8*x + y
        print(f"For z = {z}: 8x + y = {result}")
