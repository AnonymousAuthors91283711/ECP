[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where:
1. 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 60
2. a divides b (b % a = 0)
3. a+1 divides b+1 ((b+1) % (a+1) = 0)

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy these conditions and count them.

```python
def count_valid_pairs():
    count = 0
    max_b = 60
    for a in range(1, max_b + 1):
        # b must be multiple of a and >= a
        for b in range(a, max_b + 1, a):
            if (b + 1) % (a + 1) == 0:
                count += 1
                print(f"Found pair: ({a}, {b})")  # Stream partial results
    print(f"Total count: {count}")  # Final answer

count_valid_pairs()
```

The program:
1. Iterates through all possible a values from 1 to 60
2. For each a, iterates through all multiples of a (b values) up to 60
3. Checks if a+1 divides b+1
4. Counts and prints valid pairs as they're found
5. Finally prints the total count

This efficiently checks all possible pairs without redundant calculations by leveraging the divisibility condition to skip non-multiple b values.
