Exact fractions:

Result ≈ 17/5. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the enumerated answers, we can see that:
1. s ≈ 5/2 (2.5)
2. t ≈ 24
3. The result ≈ 17/5 (3.4)

The error message indicates we need to mark the real number division as noncomputable. The exact fraction 17/5 can be represented as a real number.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<(17 : ℝ) / 5>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem involves solving a system of equations with real numbers
2. The enumerated solutions show exact fractions matching the decimal approximations
3. We use (17 : ℝ) to explicitly cast the numerator to real numbers
4. The division operation is valid in ℝ but requires noncomputable marking
5. The answer 17/5 matches both the exact fraction and decimal approximation (3.4) from the enumeration[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Exact fractions:

Result ≈ 17/5. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the enumerated answers and the problem constraints, we can see that:
1. The exact fractional values match the decimal approximations (s=5/2, t=24, result=17/5)
2. The result 3.4 in decimal form is exactly 17/5 in fractional form
3. The error message suggests we need to mark the definition as noncomputable since it involves real division

Here's the corrected answer with proper Lean syntax:

<<<noncomputable abbrev P2024AIMEI_1_answer : ℝ := 17 / 5>>>

Explanation:
1. The answer 17/5 matches both the exact fractional form and decimal approximation (3.4) from the enumeration
2. We add the 'noncomputable' modifier to handle Real division properly in Lean
3. The expression maintains the exact fractional form rather than using decimal approximation
4. The type annotation ensures it's treated as a real number (ℝ)[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
