[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of two equations with three real variables (x, y, z). We'll explore possible solutions by:
1. Trying simple values for z that might simplify the equations
2. Looking for symmetric cases where x = y or x = -y
3. Checking for z=0, z=1, and other small integer values

The program will test rational values of z and attempt to find corresponding x and y values that satisfy both equations.

```python
import sympy as sp

def solve_system():
    x, y, z = sp.symbols('x y z')
    
    # Test simple z values
    for z_val in [0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 0.5, -0.5, 1.5, -1.5]:
        print(f"\nTesting z = {z_val}")
        
        # Equation 1: (1+z)(x+y) = (1-z+z²)(x²-xy+y²)
        eq1 = sp.Eq((1+z_val)*(x+y), (1-z_val+z_val**2)*(x**2-x*y+y**2))
        
        # Equation 2: (3-z)(x-y) = (9+3z+z²)(x²+xy+y²)
        eq2 = sp.Eq((3-z_val)*(x-y), (9+3*z_val+z_val**2)*(x**2+x*y+y**2))
        
        # Try x = y case
        print("Case x = y:")
        sol_x_eq_y = sp.solve([eq1.subs(y,x), eq2.subs(y,x)], x)
        print(f"Solutions: {sol_x_eq_y}")
        
        # Try x = -y case
        print("Case x = -y:")
        sol_x_eq_neg_y = sp.solve([eq1.subs(y,-x), eq2.subs(y,-x)], x)
        print(f"Solutions: {sol_x_eq_neg_y}")
        
        # Try general case
        print("General case:")
        try:
            sol = sp.solve([eq1, eq2], (x, y))
            print(f"Solutions: {sol}")
        except NotImplementedError:
            print("No general solution found")
