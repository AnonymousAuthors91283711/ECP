abbrev omnimath3395_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3395 (k : ℝ) :
    let p1 := (3, 2*k + 1)
    let p2 := (8, 4*k - 5)
    (Prod.snd p2 - Prod.snd p1) / (Prod.fst p2 - Prod.fst p1) = 0 ↔ k = omnimath3395_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found solution: k = 3
Verification - slope at k=3: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<3>>>
