theorem P2004AMCA_5 (m b : ℝ) :
  P2004AMCA_5_answer m b ↔ -1 < m * b ∧ m * b < 0 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun m b => -1 < m * b ∧ m * b < 0
Proposed Answer: fun m b : ℝ => (m > 0 ∧ b < 0 ∧ b > -1/m) ∨ (m < 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ b < -1/m)
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground Truth: -1 < m*b < 0
Proposed: (m>0 ∧ b<0 ∧ b>-1/m) ∨ (m<0 ∧ b>0 ∧ b<-1/m)

We can see that:
1. When m > 0:
   - The condition -1 < m*b < 0 becomes b ∈ (-1/m, 0)
   - Which matches (m>0 ∧ b<0 ∧ b>-1/m)

2. When m < 0:
   - The condition -1 < m*b < 0 becomes b ∈ (0, -1/m)
   - Which matches (m<0 ∧ b>0 ∧ b<-1/m)

The proposed answer correctly covers all cases where m*b is between -1 and 0 by considering both positive and negative m cases. The conditions are equivalent, just expressed differently.
