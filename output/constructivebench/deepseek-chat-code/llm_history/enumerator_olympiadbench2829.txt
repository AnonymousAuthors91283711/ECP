[write_program]
This problem asks for the greatest real number x satisfying the equation ⌊x/3⌋ + ⌈3x⌉ = √11 * x. We'll write a Python program to search for solutions by testing values in a reasonable range with small increments.

The approach:
1. Test x values from 0 to 5 (since √11 ≈ 3.3166 and the ceiling function grows quickly)
2. Use small increments (0.0001) for precision
3. For each x, compute both sides of the equation
4. Track the maximum x where the equation holds (within floating point tolerance)

```python
import math

def main():
    sqrt11 = math.sqrt(11)
    max_x = 0
    tolerance = 1e-6
    
    # Search from 0 to 5 in small increments
    x = 0.0
    while x <= 5.0:
        left_side = math.floor(x/3) + math.ceil(3*x)
        right_side = sqrt11 * x
        
        # Check if equation holds within tolerance
        if abs(left_side - right_side) < tolerance:
            print(f"Found solution: x = {x:.6f}")
            if x > max_x:
                max_x = x
        
        x += 0.0001  # Small increment for precision
    
    if max_x > 0:
        print(f"\nGreatest solution found: x ≈ {max_x:.6f}")
    else:
        print("No solutions found in the search range")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
