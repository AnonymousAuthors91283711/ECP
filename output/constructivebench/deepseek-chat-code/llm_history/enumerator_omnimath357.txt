[write_program]
This problem involves finding a real number p such that the volume of the set of points (x,y) in [0,1]×[0,1] where either x > p or y > p equals 1 - p². We'll write a Python program to numerically search for p values that satisfy this condition.

The approach:
1. The volume condition can be expressed as 1 - p² = 1 - p² (when p ≤ 0), 1 - p (when 0 < p ≤ 1), or 0 (when p > 1)
2. We'll search for p in [0,1] since outside this range the conditions don't match
3. We'll compare both sides of the equation for various p values

```python
def main():
    # Search p in [0,1] with small steps
    step = 0.0001
    for p in [i * step for i in range(0, int(1/step) + 1)]:
        # Calculate left side: volume of {x>p or y>p} in [0,1]×[0,1]
        if p <= 0:
            left = 1.0
        elif p > 1:
            left = 0.0
        else:
            left = 1 - p*p  # Area of unit square minus area where x≤p and y≤p
        
        # Calculate right side: 1 - p²
        right = 1 - p*p
        
        # Check if they're equal within floating point tolerance
        if abs(left - right) < 1e-10:
            print(f"Found candidate p = {p:.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
