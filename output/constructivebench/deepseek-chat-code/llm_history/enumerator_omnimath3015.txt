The problem asks for the sum of digits of the sum of all even numbers k from 0 to 9999 where k^2 ends with k (i.e., k is automorphic). We need to find these numbers, sum them, then calculate the digit sum of this total.

Here's a Python program that:
1. Checks numbers 0 to 9999 (even only)
2. Verifies if k^2 ends with k (automorphic)
3. Sums all such numbers
4. Calculates the digit sum of this total

```python
def is_automorphic(k):
    s = str(k)
    squared = k * k
    return str(squared).endswith(s)

total = 0
for k in range(0, 10000, 2):  # Even numbers only
    if is_automorphic(k):
        print(f"Found automorphic number: {k}")
        total += k

digit_sum = sum(int(d) for d in str(total))
print(f"Sum of automorphic numbers: {total}")
print(f"Digit sum: {digit_sum}")
```
