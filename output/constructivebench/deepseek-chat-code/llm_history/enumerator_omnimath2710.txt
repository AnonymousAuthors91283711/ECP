[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of equations with two variables x and y. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible integer solutions and compute the required expression (x + y) + (x - y) + x*y.

The approach is:
1. From the first equation (x-y)/(x+y) = 9, we can express x in terms of y
2. Substitute into the second equation to find possible y values
3. For each valid y, compute x and verify both equations
4. Calculate the expression (x + y) + (x - y) + x*y for valid pairs

```python
def solve_omnimath2710():
    # Try integer values for y from -100 to 100 (excluding y=0 to avoid division by zero)
    for y in range(-100, 101):
        if y == 0:
            continue
        # From (x-y)/(x+y) = 9, solve for x
        # x - y = 9x + 9y => -8x = 10y => x = -10y/8 = -5y/4
        x = -5 * y / 4
        
        # Verify second equation (x*y)/(x+y) = -60
        denominator = x + y
        if abs(denominator) < 1e-9:  # Avoid division by zero
            continue
        lhs = (x * y) / denominator
        if abs(lhs - (-60)) < 1e-6:  # Check if approximately equal to -60
            # Calculate the required expression
            expr = (x + y) + (x - y) + x * y
            print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}, expression = {expr}")

solve_omnimath2710()
