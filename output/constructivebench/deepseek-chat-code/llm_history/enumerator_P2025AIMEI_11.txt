This problem involves finding all real y such that there exists x where x = 34y² and f(x) = y for some function f (likely a trigonometric function given the context). We need to find the sum of all such y values in a specific form.

Since the exact function f isn't specified, we'll assume it's a common trigonometric function (like sin, cos, tan) and enumerate possible solutions for small coefficients. We'll look for y values that satisfy x = 34y² and f(x) = y, then sum them up.

```python
import math

def enumerate_solutions():
    # We'll check for trigonometric functions since the problem seems to suggest them
    # Try sin(x) = y first
    solutions = set()
    
    # Check for solutions in reasonable range (-10 to 10) with small steps
    for y in range(-1000, 1001):
        y_val = y / 100.0  # Step size of 0.01
        x = 34 * y_val**2
        # Try sin(x) = y
        if abs(math.sin(x) - y_val) < 1e-6:
            solutions.add(round(y_val, 6))
        # Try cos(x) = y
        if abs(math.cos(x) - y_val) < 1e-6:
            solutions.add(round(y_val, 6))
    
    # Print found solutions
    print("Found solutions:", sorted(solutions))
    
    # Calculate sum
    total = sum(solutions)
    print("Sum of solutions:", total)
    
    # Try to express in (a + b√c)/d form
    # This is just a placeholder - actual implementation would need more analysis
    a, b, c, d = 0, 0, 0, 1
    print(f"Expressed as: ({a} + {b}√{c})/{d}")
