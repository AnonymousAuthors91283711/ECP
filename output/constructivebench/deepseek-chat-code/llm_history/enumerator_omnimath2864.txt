[write_program]
This problem is a simple linear equation where we need to find the original length given that 60% of it was hiked and the remaining distance is 8 units. The equation can be solved algebraically, but we'll write a Python program to verify the solution by testing possible values.

The equation is: length - 0.6*length = 8 → 0.4*length = 8 → length = 8/0.4 = 20

However, since we're asked to enumerate possible answers, we'll test lengths around this expected value to confirm the solution.

```python
def find_length():
    # Test lengths from 1 to 30 in increments of 0.1
    for length in range(10, 301):  # Representing 10.0 to 30.0 in 0.1 steps
        length_val = length / 10
        hiked = 0.6 * length_val
        remaining = length_val - hiked
        if abs(remaining - 8) < 1e-6:  # Account for floating point precision
            print(f"Found possible length: {length_val}")
    
    # After enumeration, print the exact solution
    print("The exact solution is length = 20.0")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_length()
```
