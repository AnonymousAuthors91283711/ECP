theorem omnimath2735
: (3 * omnimath2735_answer = 9 + 9 + 9) ∧ (∀ n : ℕ, 3 * n = 9 + 9 + 9 → n = omnimath2735_answer) := by sorry
. Current Proposed Answer: 9. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 1 column 0, which is at "Error" in "Error", there is an error: unexpected identifier; expected command.
. Enumerated Answers: Right-hand side value: 27
Found solution: 9. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the problem statement and enumerated answers, we can observe:
1. The theorem states that 3 * answer = 27 (since 9+9+9=27)
2. The enumerated solution shows the answer is 9 (since 3*9=27)
3. The problem requires uniqueness (∀ n, 3*n=27 → n=answer)

The simplest solution satisfying these conditions is clearly 9. The error in the proposed answer was likely due to syntax issues rather than mathematical content.

Here's the corrected answer in Lean syntax:
