Explanation: The problem seeks the smallest n where 20n is divisible by 12, 14, and 15. This reduces to finding the least common multiple adjusted by the greatest common divisor pattern seen in the enumerated answer (420 = lcm(12,14,15)*20/gcd(12,14,15)).[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

. Enumerated Answers: 420. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Looking at the problem, we need to find the smallest natural number n such that:
1. 12 divides 20n (12r = 20n)
2. 14 divides 20n (14g = 20n) 
3. 15 divides 20n (15b = 20n)

This is equivalent to finding the least n where 20n is a common multiple of 12, 14, and 15. The minimal such n would be the least common multiple (LCM) of 12, 14, and 15 divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20 and the LCM.

The enumerated answer is 420, which is LCM(12,14,15) = 420. Since GCD(20,420) = 20, we get n = 420/1 = 420 (since 20n must be divisible by LCM(12,14,15)).

The error in the original expression comes from ambiguous namespace resolution and incorrect parentheses. Here's the fixed version:

<<<Nat.lcm (Nat.lcm 12 14) 15 / Nat.gcd 20 (Nat.lcm (Nat.lcm 12 14) 15)>>>

Explanation:
1. We first compute LCM(12,14,15) = 420
2. Then compute GCD(20,420) = 20
3. The minimal n is 420/1 = 420 (since 420/20 = 21, but 21*20=420 is divisible by all three numbers)

The expression calculates the LCM of the denominators (12,14,15) divided by their GCD with the numerator (20). This gives the minimal n satisfying all divisibility conditions.
