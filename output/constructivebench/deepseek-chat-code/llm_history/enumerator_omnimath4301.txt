[write_program]
This problem asks for the largest number N such that there exists an n-digit number where every non-empty sublist of its digits contains at least one digit that appears exactly once in that sublist. We'll write a Python program to enumerate such numbers and find the maximum N.

The approach:
1. Generate numbers with increasing digit lengths
2. For each number, check all non-empty sublists of its digits
3. Verify if each sublist has at least one digit appearing exactly once
4. Track the maximum digit length found that satisfies this condition

```python
def has_unique_digit_in_all_sublists(n):
    digits = list(map(int, str(n)))
    length = len(digits)
    
    # Generate all non-empty sublists
    from itertools import combinations
    for start in range(length):
        for end in range(start + 1, length + 1):
            sub = digits[start:end]
            # Check if any digit appears exactly once
            if not any(sub.count(d) == 1 for d in sub):
                return False
    return True

max_n = 0
# We'll check up to 6-digit numbers (can be increased if needed)
for length in range(1, 7):
    start = 10**(length-1)
    end = 10**length
    found = False
    for n in range(start, end):
        if has_unique_digit_in_all_sublists(n):
            print(f"Found {length}-digit number: {n}")
            max_n = max(max_n, length)
            found = True
            break
    if not found:
        print(f"No {length}-digit numbers satisfy the condition")
        
print(f"Maximum N found: {max_n}")
```
