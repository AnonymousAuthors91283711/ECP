[write_program]
This problem appears to be about finding natural numbers n > 0 where the sum of their divisors equals a power of 2. We'll write a Python program to enumerate such numbers up to a reasonable threshold and check the condition.

The approach:
1. Generate all numbers from 1 to a threshold (we'll use 1000)
2. For each number, find all divisors
3. Sum the divisors and check if the sum is a power of 2
4. Print numbers that satisfy the condition

```python
def is_power_of_two(x):
    return (x & (x - 1)) == 0 and x != 0

def get_divisors(n):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(n // i)
    return sorted(divisors)

max_n = 1000
print(f"Checking numbers up to {max_n} where sum of divisors is a power of 2:")
for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    divisors = get_divisors(n)
    sum_div = sum(divisors)
    if is_power_of_two(sum_div):
        print(f"n = {n}, sum of divisors = {sum_div} = 2^{sum_div.bit_length()-1}")
```
