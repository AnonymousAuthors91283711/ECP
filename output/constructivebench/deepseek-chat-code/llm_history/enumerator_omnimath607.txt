The problem involves counting the number of ordered pairs (a1, a2) in Fin 6 × Fin 6 (i.e., pairs of numbers modulo 6) such that for exactly 6 ordered pairs (b1, b2), the expression (a1*b1 + a2*b2) ≡ 0 mod 6. We need to enumerate all possible (a1,a2) pairs and count how many satisfy this condition.

Here's a Python program that enumerates all possible (a1,a2) pairs in Z/6Z × Z/6Z and counts how many pairs (b1,b2) satisfy the condition for each (a1,a2):

```python
from itertools import product

def count_favorable_b(a1, a2):
    count = 0
    for b1, b2 in product(range(6), repeat=2):
        if (a1 * b1 + a2 * b2) % 6 == 0:
            count += 1
    return count

favorable_a = 0
for a1, a2 in product(range(6), repeat=2):
    if count_favorable_b(a1, a2) == 6:
        favorable_a += 1
        print(f"Found favorable pair: ({a1}, {a2})")

print(f"Total favorable pairs: {favorable_a}")
print(f"Probability: {favorable_a}/36 = {favorable_a/36}")
```

The program:
1. Defines a function to count how many (b1,b2) pairs satisfy the condition for a given (a1,a2)
2. Iterates through all possible (a1,a2) pairs in Z/6Z × Z/6Z
3. Prints each favorable (a1,a2) pair as it's found
4. Finally prints the total count and probability

The output will show all pairs (a1,a2) that have exactly 6 solutions (b1,b2), then the total count and probability. This helps verify the theorem statement empirically.
