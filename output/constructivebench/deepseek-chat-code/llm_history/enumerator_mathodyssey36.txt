[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimal number of terms n needed to express the quadratic polynomial x² + x + 4 as a sum of squares of linear forms (aᵢx + bᵢ)². We'll write a Python program to find the smallest n where this is possible by checking n=1,2,... until we find a solution.

The approach:
1. For each n, we'll expand the sum of squares into a quadratic form
2. Compare coefficients with x² + x + 4
3. Solve the resulting system of equations for aᵢ and bᵢ
4. The smallest n with a solution is our answer

```python
import sympy as sp

def find_min_n():
    x = sp.symbols('x')
    target = x**2 + x + 4
    
    for n in range(1, 5):  # Try n up to 4 (likely answer is 3)
        a = sp.symbols(f'a0:{n}')
        b = sp.symbols(f'b0:{n}')
        sum_sq = sum((a[i]*x + b[i])**2 for i in range(n))
        expanded = sp.expand(sum_sq)
        
        # Get coefficients for x², x, and constant term
        coeff_x2 = expanded.coeff(x, 2)
        coeff_x = expanded.coeff(x, 1)
        coeff_const = expanded.coeff(x, 0)
        
        # Solve system of equations
        sol = sp.solve([
            coeff_x2 - 1,  # x² coefficient = 1
            coeff_x - 1,   # x coefficient = 1
            coeff_const - 4 # constant term = 4
        ], a + b)
        
        if sol:
            print(f"Solution found for n = {n}")
            print("One possible solution:")
            for i in range(n):
                print(f"a_{i} = {sol[a[i]]}, b_{i} = {sol[b[i]]}")
            return n
    
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    min_n = find_min_n()
    print(f"\nThe minimal n is: {min_n}")
