[write_program]
This problem involves finding all natural numbers `a > 0` such that the function `f(x) = x XOR (a*x)` is injective. We'll write a Python program to enumerate small values of `a` where this property holds, looking for patterns.

The approach:
1. For each candidate `a`, test the injectivity condition by checking all pairs `(x,y)` up to a reasonable bound
2. We'll limit our search to `a` values up to 100 and `x,y` up to 1000 for efficiency
3. The program will output each `a` that appears to satisfy the condition

```python
def is_injective(a, max_test=1000):
    """Check if f(x) = x ^ (a*x) is injective for x up to max_test"""
    seen = set()
    for x in range(max_test + 1):
        fx = x ^ (a * x)
        if fx in seen:
            return False
        seen.add(fx)
    return True

def find_valid_a(max_a=100):
    """Find all a <= max_a where f(x) = x ^ (a*x) appears injective"""
    valid = []
    for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
        if is_injective(a):
            valid.append(a)
            print(f"Found candidate: {a}")
    print("\nFinal candidates found:", valid)

find_valid_a()
```
