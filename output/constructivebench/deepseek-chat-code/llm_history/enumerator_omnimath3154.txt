[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of integers n between 1 and 100 such that n³ + 5n² is a perfect square. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such n values in this range.

The approach is:
1. Iterate through n from 1 to 100
2. For each n, compute n³ + 5n²
3. Check if the result is a perfect square
4. Count and print all valid n values

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(x):
    s = int(math.isqrt(x))
    return s * s == x

count = 0
for n in range(1, 101):
    val = n**3 + 5 * n**2
    if is_perfect_square(val):
        print(f"Found solution: n = {n}")
        count += 1

print(f"Total solutions found: {count}")
```
