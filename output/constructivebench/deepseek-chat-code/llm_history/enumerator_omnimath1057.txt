[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of 4-tuples (s0,s1,s2,s3) of positive integers that sum to 16 and satisfy s_i ≤ sum of the other three elements for each i. This is equivalent to s_i ≤ 8 for each i since the total sum is 16.

We'll enumerate all possible combinations where:
1. Each s_i is a positive integer (1 ≤ s_i ≤ 8)
2. s0 + s1 + s2 + s3 = 16
3. Each s_i ≤ 8 (implied by the sum constraint)

The program will count all valid tuples by iterating through possible values while respecting the constraints.

```python
count = 0

# Iterate through all possible values of s0, s1, s2
# s3 is determined by s3 = 16 - s0 - s1 - s2
for s0 in range(1, 9):
    for s1 in range(1, 9):
        # Early exit if s0 + s1 is too large
        if s0 + s1 > 15:
            continue
        for s2 in range(1, 9):
            s3 = 16 - s0 - s1 - s2
            if 1 <= s3 <= 8:
                count += 1
                # Print each valid tuple as we find it
                print((s0, s1, s2, s3))

print(f"Total number of valid tuples: {count}")
```
