Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0), (1, 2), (-1, 3)}
Proposed Answer: {(0, 0), (-1, 3), (1, 2), (3, -1), (2, 1)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find all integer pairs (x,y) that satisfy the equation:
   7x + 14y = 5x² + 5xy + 5y²

2. The ground truth answer provides three solutions: (0,0), (1,2), and (-1,3)

3. The proposed answer adds two more solutions: (3,-1) and (2,1)

Now let's test the proposed additional solutions:

For (3,-1):
7*3 + 14*(-1) = 21 - 14 = 7
5*9 + 5*3*(-1) + 5*1 = 45 - 15 + 5 = 35 ≠ 7 → Doesn't satisfy

For (2,1):
7*2 + 14*1 = 14 + 14 = 28
5*4 + 5*2*1 + 5*1 = 20 + 10 + 5 = 35 ≠ 28 → Doesn't satisfy

The proposed answer includes incorrect pairs that don't satisfy the original equation. Only the first three pairs in the proposed answer are correct.

<<<False>>>
