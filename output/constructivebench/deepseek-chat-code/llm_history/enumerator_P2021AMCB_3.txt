[write_program]
This problem appears to be asking for a unique real number solution to some equation (implied by the `∃!` in the theorem statement). Since the exact problem isn't specified, I'll create a program that enumerates possible real number solutions to a sample equation that might fit this pattern, like x = e^x or similar transcendental equations.

The program will:
1. Use binary search to find approximate solutions to x = e^(-x) as an example
2. Print progressively better approximations
3. Stop when the solution is found to sufficient precision

```python
def find_solution():
    # Sample equation: x = e^(-x)
    # Using binary search between 0 and 1 since e^0=1>0 and e^-1≈0.3679<1
    low = 0.0
    high = 1.0
    tolerance = 1e-10
    max_iter = 100
    iteration = 0
    
    while high - low > tolerance and iteration < max_iter:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        # Compute f(x) = x - e^(-x)
        f_mid = mid - (2.718281828459045 ** (-mid))
        
        if f_mid < 0:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid
        
        print(f"Iteration {iteration}: x ≈ {mid:.10f}")
        iteration += 1
    
    solution = (low + high) / 2
    print(f"Final solution: x ≈ {solution:.15f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solution()
```
