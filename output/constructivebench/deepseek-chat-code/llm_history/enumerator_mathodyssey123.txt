This problem asks for the maximum possible sum of a subset A of {0,1,...,20} such that there exists a disjoint subset B where for every n in A, 2n+2 is in B. We'll enumerate all possible subsets A and check the condition.

The approach:
1. Generate all subsets of {0,...,20}
2. For each subset A, compute the required B elements (2n+2 for n in A)
3. Check if A and B are disjoint
4. Track the maximum sum of valid A sets

```python
from itertools import combinations

def solve():
    max_sum = 0
    elements = list(range(21))  # 0 to 20
    # We'll check subsets in order of decreasing size for efficiency
    for size in range(20, 0, -1):
        found = False
        for A in combinations(elements, size):
            B_elements = {2*n + 2 for n in A}
            # Check if A and B are disjoint and B is within range
            if not set(A) & B_elements and max(B_elements) <= 20:
                current_sum = sum(A)
                if current_sum > max_sum:
                    max_sum = current_sum
                    print(f"New max sum: {max_sum} with A: {A}")
                    found = True
        # Early termination if we found a valid subset of this size
        if found:
            break
    print(f"Final maximum sum: {max_sum}")

solve()
```
