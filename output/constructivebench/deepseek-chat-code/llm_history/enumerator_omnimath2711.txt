The problem asks for the smallest odd integer `x` such that the sum of five consecutive odd numbers starting from `x` equals 125. The sum can be simplified to `5x + 20 = 125`, which reduces to `x = 21`. We'll verify this by enumerating possible odd integers around this value.

```python
def find_smallest_odd_sum():
    # The equation simplifies to 5x + 20 = 125 => x = 21
    # We'll check around this value to confirm
    target = 125
    for x in range(15, 30, 2):  # Check odd numbers near the solution
        total = x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8)
        print(f"Testing x={x}, sum={total}")
        if total == target:
            print(f"Found solution: x={x}")
            return x
    return None
