[write_program]
This problem asks for an integer `m` that cannot be expressed as part of a pair `(m,n)` satisfying the given polynomial identity and the condition `m*n = -12`. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible integer pairs `(m,n)` where `m*n = -12` and then find which integers (within a reasonable range) don't appear as `m` in any such pair.

The approach is:
1. Find all factor pairs of -12 (both positive and negative)
2. Collect all unique `m` values from these pairs
3. Check which integers in a range aren't in this set

```python
def find_non_m_values():
    # Find all factor pairs (m,n) where m*n = -12
    target = -12
    factors = set()
    
    # Iterate through possible divisors of -12
    for m in range(-abs(target), abs(target)+1):
        if m == 0:
            continue  # Can't divide by zero
        if target % m == 0:
            n = target // m
            factors.add(m)
    
    # Now check which integers in a reasonable range aren't in factors
    # We'll check from -20 to 20 as a reasonable range
    non_m_values = []
    for candidate in range(-20, 21):
        if candidate not in factors:
            non_m_values.append(candidate)
    
    print("Possible m values from factor pairs:", sorted(factors))
    print("Integers not appearing as m values:", non_m_values)
    print("One such value is:", non_m_values[0] if non_m_values else "None found")

find_non_m_values()
```
