[write_program]
The problem asks for the smallest positive integer k that is divisible by 3, 5, 7, and 9. This is equivalent to finding the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. Since 9 is a multiple of 3, we can simplify the condition to just requiring divisibility by 5, 7, and 9 (as any number divisible by 9 will automatically be divisible by 3).

We'll write a Python program that:
1. Checks numbers in ascending order
2. For each number, verifies if it's divisible by 5, 7, and 9
3. Outputs the first number that satisfies all conditions (which will be the LCM)

```python
def find_min_k():
    k = 1
    while True:
        if k % 5 == 0 and k % 7 == 0 and k % 9 == 0:
            print(f"Found solution: {k}")
            return k
        k += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_k()
```
