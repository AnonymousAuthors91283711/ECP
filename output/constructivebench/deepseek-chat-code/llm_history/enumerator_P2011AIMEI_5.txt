[write_program]
This problem involves counting valid arrangements of digits 1-9 around a circle such that for every three consecutive vertices, their sum is divisible by 3. We'll write a Python program to enumerate these arrangements for small cases (n=3,6,9) to help identify the pattern.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def count_valid_arrangements(n):
    digits = range(1, n+1)
    count = 0
    
    for perm in permutations(digits):
        valid = True
        # Check all consecutive triplets (including wrap-around)
        for i in range(n):
            a, b, c = perm[i], perm[(i+1)%n], perm[(i+2)%n]
            if (a + b + c) % 3 != 0:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1
            # Print first few valid permutations to show examples
            if count <= 3:
                print(f"Valid permutation {count}: {perm}")
    
    # Adjust for circular symmetry (divide by n)
    # But since permutations are already ordered, we don't need to adjust
    return count

# Test for small cases
for n in [3, 6, 9]:
    print(f"\nTesting n = {n}")
    total = count_valid_arrangements(n)
    print(f"Total valid arrangements for n={n}: {total}")
    # For n=9, we expect the answer to be 1332 (from AIME problem)
    # But we'll let the enumeration reveal this
```
