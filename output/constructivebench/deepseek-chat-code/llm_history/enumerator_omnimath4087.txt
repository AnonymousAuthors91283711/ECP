[write_program]
This problem asks for natural numbers n > 1 where n² divides (2ⁿ + 1). We'll write a Python program to search for such numbers up to a reasonable threshold, as higher numbers become computationally intensive.

The approach:
1. Iterate through numbers n from 2 to a threshold (we'll use 1000)
2. For each n, check if n² divides (2ⁿ + 1)
3. Print any numbers that satisfy this condition

```python
def main():
    threshold = 1000
    print(f"Searching for n > 1 where n² divides (2ⁿ + 1) up to n = {threshold}:")
    
    for n in range(2, threshold + 1):
        power = pow(2, n, n * n)  # Efficiently compute 2^n mod n²
        if (power + 1) % (n * n) == 0:
            print(f"Found solution: n = {n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
