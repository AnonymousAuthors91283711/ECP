theorem P2006AIMEI_5
  (a b c : ℤ)
  (habc : a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ c > 0)
  (h : Real.sqrt (104 * Real.sqrt 6 + 468 * Real.sqrt 10 + 144 * Real.sqrt 15 + 2006) = a * Real.sqrt 2 + b * Real.sqrt 3 + c * Real.sqrt 5) :
  a * b * c = P2006AIMEI_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found candidate: a=13, b=4, c=18, product=936

Best solution found: a=13, b=4, c=18
Product a*b*c = 936. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<936>>>
