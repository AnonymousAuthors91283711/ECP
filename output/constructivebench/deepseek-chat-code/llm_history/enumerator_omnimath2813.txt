[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of integers x satisfying 5/7 < x < 28/3. We'll write a Python program to count these integers by:

1. Calculating the exact bounds (5/7 ≈ 0.714, 28/3 ≈ 9.333)
2. Finding the smallest integer > 5/7 (which is 1)
3. Finding the largest integer < 28/3 (which is 9)
4. Counting all integers from 1 to 9 inclusive

```python
def count_integers_in_range():
    lower_bound = 5/7
    upper_bound = 28/3
    
    # Find smallest integer > lower_bound
    min_x = int(lower_bound) + 1
    
    # Find largest integer < upper_bound
    max_x = int(upper_bound) - (1 if upper_bound.is_integer() else 0)
    
    # Count integers in range
    count = max_x - min_x + 1
    
    print(f"Integers satisfying {lower_bound} < x < {upper_bound}:")
    print(f"Minimum x: {min_x}")
    print(f"Maximum x: {max_x}")
    print(f"Count: {count}")
