[write_program]
This problem appears to be a simple algebraic equation evaluation. The task is to compute the value of the expression `2 * 2^2 + 3 * 2^2`. Since this is a straightforward calculation, we'll write a Python program that computes and prints the exact value.

The expression simplifies to `(2 + 3) * 2^2 = 5 * 4 = 20`. However, following the requirements, we'll write a program that computes this without hardcoding the answer.

```python
# Compute the expression 2*2^2 + 3*2^2
result = 2 * (2 ** 2) + 3 * (2 ** 2)
print(result)
```
