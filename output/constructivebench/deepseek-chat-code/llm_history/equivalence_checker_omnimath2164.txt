theorem omnimath2164 (a c : ℝ) :
  (∀ b : ℝ, ∃ x y, a * x + b * y = c - 1 ∧ (a + 5) * x + (b + 3) * y = c + 1) ↔ c = omnimath2164_answer a := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a => (2 * a + 5) / 5
Proposed Answer: fun a => (a^2 + 5*a + 6)/(a + 3)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a condition on c (in terms of a) such that for every real b, there exist x,y satisfying both given linear equations.

2. The ground truth answer is a linear fractional function: (2a + 5)/5

3. The proposed answer is a rational function: (a² + 5a + 6)/(a + 3)

To check equivalence:
- The proposed answer simplifies to (a+2)(a+3)/(a+3) = a+2 when a ≠ -3
- At a = -3, the proposed answer is undefined (denominator zero)
- The ground truth gives c = (2*(-3)+5)/5 = -1/5 at a = -3
- The simplified form a+2 differs from (2a+5)/5 = 0.4a + 1

The two functions are different:
- At a=0: ground truth gives 1, proposed gives 2
- At a=5: ground truth gives 3, proposed gives 7
