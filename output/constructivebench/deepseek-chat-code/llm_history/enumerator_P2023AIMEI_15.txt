[write_program]
This problem involves finding the largest prime p < 1000 for which there exists a complex number z satisfying two given equations. We'll write a Python program to enumerate primes p < 1000 and check for solutions z to the system of equations.

The approach will be:
1. Generate all primes below 1000
2. For each prime p, check if there exists a complex z satisfying:
   - z³ = (z² + 1)*i
   - i*z² = (z + 1)²
3. Track the largest prime satisfying these conditions

We'll use numerical approximation with a tolerance to check the equations.

import cmath

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]:
        if n % p == 0:
            return n == p
    d = n - 1
    s = 0
    while d % 2 == 0:
        d //= 2
        s += 1
    for a in [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]:
        if a >= n:
            continue
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(s - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False
    return True

def check_equations(z, tol=1e-8):
    eq1 = z**3 - (z**2 + 1)*1j
    eq2 = 1j*z**2 - (z + 1)**2
    return abs(eq1) < tol and abs(eq2) < tol

max_prime = 0
for p in range(999, 1, -1):
    if not is_prime(p):
        continue
    
    # Try to find z that satisfies the equations
    # We'll sample points on a circle of radius 1 as initial guess
    found = False
    for angle in range(0, 360, 15):  # Check every 15 degrees
        theta = math.radians(angle)
        z = cmath.rect(1.0, theta)  # Complex number with magnitude 1
        if check_equations(z):
            print(f"Found prime {p} with solution z ≈ {z}")
            max_prime = p
            found = True
            break
    
    if found:
        break

print(f"Largest prime found: {max_prime}")
