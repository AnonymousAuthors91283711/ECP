[write_program]
This problem asks to find all quadruples (x,y,z,w) of natural numbers satisfying the equation 2^x * 3^y - 5^z * 7^w = 1. We'll write a Python program to search for solutions by bounding the exponents and checking all combinations.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible exponents x,y,z,w up to reasonable bounds
2. For each combination, compute both sides of the equation
3. Check if the difference equals 1
4. Print valid solutions as they're found

We'll use small bounds (10 for each exponent) since larger values quickly make the numbers too big and unlikely to satisfy the equation.

```python
def find_solutions():
    max_exp = 10  # Maximum exponent to try for each variable
    print(f"Searching for solutions with exponents up to {max_exp}...")
    
    for x in range(max_exp + 1):
        for y in range(max_exp + 1):
            left = (2 ** x) * (3 ** y)
            if left == 0:
                continue
            for z in range(max_exp + 1):
                for w in range(max_exp + 1):
                    right = (5 ** z) * (7 ** w)
                    if left - right == 1:
                        print(f"Solution found: (x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, w={w})")
    
    print("Search complete.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_solutions()
