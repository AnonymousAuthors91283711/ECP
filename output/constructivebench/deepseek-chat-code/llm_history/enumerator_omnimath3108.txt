[write_program]
The problem is to compute the distance between two real numbers, -5 and 6. The distance between two real numbers a and b is defined as |a - b|. 

We'll write a Python program that:
1. Defines the two numbers
2. Computes their absolute difference
3. Prints the exact value (since this is a simple computation)

```python
a = -5
b = 6
distance = abs(a - b)
print(distance)
```
