This problem asks to find the smallest positive integer n such that the binomial coefficient C(n+2, 2) equals C(n, 2) + 75. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of n and find the minimal solution.

The key observation is that C(n+2,2) - C(n,2) simplifies to 2n+1, so we're essentially solving 2n+1 = 75. However, we'll verify this through enumeration for demonstration purposes.

```python
def find_min_n(T=75):
    """Find the smallest n>0 where C(n+2,2) = C(n,2) + T"""
    print(f"Searching for minimal n where C(n+2,2) = C(n,2) + {T}")
    
    def C(k, 2):  # Binomial coefficient C(k,2)
        return k * (k - 1) // 2
    
    min_n = None
    for n in range(1, 100):  # Reasonable upper bound
        if C(n + 2, 2) == C(n, 2) + T:
            print(f"Found candidate: n = {n}")
            if min_n is None:
                min_n = n
    
    if min_n is not None:
        print(f"Minimal solution: n = {min_n}")
    else:
        print("No solution found in range")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_n()

Let me analyze this problem and the provided program:

Judgement:
1. The problem asks for the smallest positive integer n where C(n+2,2) = C(n,2) + 75.
2. The program correctly implements the binomial coefficient calculation and searches for solutions.
3. The program prints intermediate candidates and the minimal solution if found.
4. The output shows "No solution found in range" because the range (1,100) is too small - the actual solution is n=150.
5. The program follows all requirements (streaming results, no hardcoding, etc.) but fails to find the solution due to insufficient search range.

The program is fundamentally correct in approach but needs adjustment in the search range. Since C(n+2,2)-C(n,2) = 2n+1, the equation becomes 2n+1=75 → n=37, but this seems too simple. Wait, let's verify:

C(n+2,2) - C(n,2) = [(n+2)(n+1) - n(n-1)]/2 = [n²+3n+2 - n²+n]/2 = (4n+2)/2 = 2n+1

So indeed, 2n+1 = 75 → n = 37. The program should find this solution, but it's not showing up in the output, which suggests there might be an error in the implementation.

Looking closer, the program defines C(k,2) with a parameter named '2', which is invalid Python syntax. This is the root cause of the empty output.

<<<False>>>

Here's the corrected program:

```python
def find_min_n(T=75):
    """Find the smallest n>0 where C(n+2,2) = C(n,2) + T"""
    print(f"Searching for minimal n where C(n+2,2) = C(n,2) + {T}")
    
    def C(k, r=2):  # Binomial coefficient C(k,2)
        return k * (k - 1) // 2
    
    min_n = None
    for n in range(1, 100):  # Range sufficient for T=75
        if C(n + 2) == C(n) + T:
            print(f"Found candidate: n = {n}")
            if min_n

Explanation:
The problem asks to find the smallest positive integer n such that the binomial coefficient C(n+2, 2) equals C(n, 2) + 75. This is a mathematical problem that can be solved algebraically or through enumeration.

Since no program was provided (resulting in an "Error: Program is empty" message), we must reject this submission. We need to create a Python program that solves this problem by enumerating possible values of n and checking the given condition.

The mathematical relationship can be simplified:
C(n+2,2) = C(n,2) + 75
=> (n+2)(n+1)/2 = n(n-1)/2 + 75
=> (n² + 3n + 2)/2 = (n² - n)/2 + 75
=> n² + 3n + 2 = n² - n + 150
=> 4n = 148
=> n = 37

However, since the problem requires an enumerative approach, we'll write a program that checks values of n until it finds the smallest one satisfying the condition.

<<<False>>>

```python
def find_min_n():
    T = 75  # Given parameter
    n = 1
    while True:
        # Calculate both sides of the equation
        lhs = (n + 2) * (n + 1) // 2
        rhs = n * (n - 1) // 2 + T
        if lhs == rhs:
            print(n)  # Output the first (smallest) solution found
            return
        n += 1

find_min_n()
```
