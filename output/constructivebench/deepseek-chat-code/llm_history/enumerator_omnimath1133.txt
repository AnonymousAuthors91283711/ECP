[write_program]
This problem appears to be about calculating a probability of drawing marbles from a bag with given constraints. The exact probability is stated as 9/26 when drawing 65 marbles from a bag containing 50 red, 50 blue, and 30 yellow marbles. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible combinations that could lead to this probability.

The program will:
1. Calculate the total number of marbles (130)
2. Compute all possible combinations of drawing 65 marbles
3. Count cases where certain conditions are met (though the exact conditions aren't specified)
4. Calculate the probability as favorable cases divided by total cases

Since the exact conditions aren't specified, we'll focus on the combinatorial aspects and output intermediate results.

```python
from math import comb

def main():
    total_red = 50
    total_blue = 50
    total_yellow = 30
    total_marbles = total_red + total_blue + total_yellow
    num_drawn = 65
    
    print(f"Parameters: {total_red} red, {total_blue} blue, {total_yellow} yellow marbles")
    print(f"Drawing {num_drawn} marbles from {total_marbles} total marbles")
    
    # Total possible combinations
    total_combinations = comb(total_marbles, num_drawn)
    print(f"Total combinations: {total_combinations}")
    
    # Example: count combinations with exactly 30 red marbles
    # (This is just an example since the actual condition isn't specified)
    example_condition = lambda r, b, y: r == 30
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through possible counts of red marbles
    for red in range(max(0, num_drawn - (total_blue + total_yellow)), min(total_red, num_drawn) + 1):
        remaining = num_drawn - red
        # Iterate through possible counts of blue marbles
        for blue in range(max(0, remaining - total_yellow), min(total_blue, remaining) + 1):
            yellow = remaining - blue
            if example_condition(red, blue, yellow):
                combinations = comb(total_red, red) * comb(total_blue, blue) * comb(total_yellow, yellow)
                count += combinations
    
    if count > 0:
        probability = count / total_combinations
        print(f"Example probability (r=30): {probability} ({count}/{total_combinations})")
    else:
        print("No combinations satisfy the example condition")
