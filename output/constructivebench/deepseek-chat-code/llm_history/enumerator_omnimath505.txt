This problem asks for the greatest integer k that divides m⁵ - 5m³ + 4m for all integers m ≥ 5. We'll approach this by:

1. Factorizing the polynomial to understand its structure
2. Evaluating the polynomial at small values of m to find common divisors
3. Verifying the greatest common divisor of these evaluations

The polynomial factors as m(m²-1)(m²-4) = (m-2)(m-1)m(m+1)(m+2), which is a product of 5 consecutive integers. This suggests divisibility by 5! = 120 is likely.

```python
def compute_poly(m):
    return m**5 - 5*m**3 + 4*m

def factorize(n):
    factors = {}
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors[2] = factors.get(2, 0) + 1
        n = n // 2
    i = 3
    while i*i <= n:
        while n % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            n = n // i
        i += 2
    if n > 1:
        factors[n] = 1
    return factors

def compute_gcd(values):
    from math import gcd
    current_gcd = values[0]
    for num in values[1:]:
        current_gcd = gcd(current_gcd, num)
        if current_gcd == 1:
            break
    return current_gcd

# Evaluate polynomial for m from 5 to 15 (sufficient to find pattern)
values = [compute_poly(m) for m in range(5, 16)]
print("Polynomial values for m=5..15:", values)

# Compute GCD of these values
k = compute_gcd(values)
print("GCD of these values:", k)

# Verify factorization of GCD
print("Prime factorization of GCD:", factorize(k))
```
