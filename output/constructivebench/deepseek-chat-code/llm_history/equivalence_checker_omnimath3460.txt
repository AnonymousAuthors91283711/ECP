Ground Truth Answer: fun pairs => ∃ (p : ℚ × ℚ), p ∈ pairs ∧ (73 + 82 + 85 + p.1 + p.2) / 5 < 80
Proposed Answer: fun pairs => ∃ p ∈ pairs, p.1 + p.2 < 80 * 5 - (73 + 82 + 85)
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. Ground truth: ∃ p ∈ pairs, (73 + 82 + 85 + p.1 + p.2)/5 < 80
2. Proposed: ∃ p ∈ pairs, p.1 + p.2 < 80*5 - (73 + 82 + 85)

The proposed answer is algebraically equivalent to the ground truth:
- Starting from (73 + 82 + 85 + p.1 + p.2)/5 < 80
- Multiply both sides by 5: 73 + 82 + 85 + p.1 + p.2 < 400
- Subtract (73 + 82 + 85) from both sides: p.1 + p.2 < 400 - (73 + 82 + 85)
- Which is exactly what the proposed answer states

The only difference is the form of the inequality, but they express exactly the same condition.
