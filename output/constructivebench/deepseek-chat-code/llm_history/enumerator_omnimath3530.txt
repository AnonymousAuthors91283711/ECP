The problem asks to find all real numbers x such that x^3 < x^2. We need to enumerate possible intervals where this inequality holds. The solution involves analyzing the inequality and finding the ranges of x where it's true.

We'll approach this by:
1. Rewriting the inequality as x^3 - x^2 < 0
2. Factoring to x^2(x - 1) < 0
3. Analyzing the sign changes around critical points (x=0 and x=1)
4. Testing intervals to see where the inequality holds

The program will test sample points in different intervals to verify where the inequality is satisfied.

```python
def test_inequality(x):
    return x**3 < x**2

# Test points around critical points 0 and 1
test_points = [-2, -1, -0.5, 0.5, 0.9, 1, 1.1, 2]

print("Testing points where x^3 < x^2:")
for x in test_points:
    result = test_inequality(x)
    print(f"x = {x}: {result}")

# The inequality holds when x < 1 (except x=0 where equality occurs)
print("\nBased on testing, the inequality holds for:")
print("x < 0 or 0 < x < 1")
```
