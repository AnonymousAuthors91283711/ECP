Ground Truth Answer: ∅
Proposed Answer: {0, 1, -1} ∪ {x : ℝ | ∃ k : ℤ, k ≠ 0 ∧ x = (Real.log (2 + Real.sqrt 3) + 2 * Real.pi * k) / Real.log 2}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation can be rewritten using 2^x = exp(x*log2):
   2^x + 2^(x³) = 2*2^(x²)

2. Simplifying:
   2^x + 2^(x³) = 2^(x² + 1)

3. The ground truth answer is the empty set (∅), meaning no real numbers satisfy both conditions.

4. The proposed answer suggests solutions at x=0,1,-1 and some other forms. However:
   - For x=0: 1 + 1 = 2*1 → 2=2 (satisfies first condition) but fails second condition (1≠1 ∨ 1≠1 is false)
   - For x=1: 2 + 2 = 2*2 → 4=4 (satisfies first) but fails second (2≠2 ∨ 2≠2 is false)
   - For x=-1: 0.5 + 0.5 = 2*0.5 → 1=1 (satisfies first) but fails second (0.5≠0.5 ∨ 0.5≠0.5 is false)
   - The other proposed solutions would similarly fail the second condition

The proposed answer incorrectly includes solutions that don't satisfy both conditions of the original problem. The ground truth answer (empty set) is correct.
