theorem P2016AMCB_3 (x : ℤ) (hx : x = -2016) : 
  P2016AMCB_3_answer x = 4032 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => abs (abs (abs (abs x - x) - abs x) - x)
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℤ => -x + 4032
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a function that takes an integer x and returns 4032 when x = -2016.

2. Ground Truth Answer: This is a nested absolute value function that simplifies to:
   - For x ≥ 0: fun x => x
   - For x < 0: fun x => -3x

3. Proposed Answer: This is a linear function fun x => -x + 4032

Testing at x = -2016:
- Ground Truth: abs(abs(abs(abs(-2016) - (-2016)) - abs(-2016)) - (-2016)) = 4032
- Proposed: -(-2016) + 4032 = 2016 + 4032 = 6048 ≠ 4032

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth at x = -2016, nor does it match the general behavior of the ground truth function.
