[write_program]
This problem appears to be about finding conditions under which a set S containing m and closed under divisors and pairwise sums of nth powers must equal the universal set of natural numbers. We'll write a Python program to explore small values of n and m to find patterns.

The program will:
1. Test small values of n and m
2. For each (n,m) pair, check if the condition holds by simulating the set construction
3. Output cases where the condition appears to hold

```python
def divisors(a):
    return {d for d in range(1, a+1) if a % d == 0}

def test_condition(n, m, max_check=20):
    S = {m}
    changed = True
    while changed:
        changed = False
        # Add divisors of all elements
        new_elements = set()
        for a in list(S):
            for d in divisors(a):
                if d not in S:
                    new_elements.add(d)
                    changed = True
        S.update(new_elements)
        
        # Add a^n + b^n for distinct pairs
        new_elements = set()
        elements = list(S)
        for i in range(len(elements)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(elements)):
                a, b = elements[i], elements[j]
                if a != b:
                    val = a**n + b**n
                    if val not in S and val <= max_check:
                        new_elements.add(val)
                        changed = True
        S.update(new_elements)
    
    # Check if S contains all numbers up to max_check
    return all(k in S for k in range(1, max_check+1))

def main():
    max_n = 5
    max_m = 10
    print(f"Testing n from 1 to {max_n}, m from 1 to {max_m}")
    for n in range(1, max_n+1):
        for m in range(1, max_m+1):
            if test_condition(n, m):
                print(f"Condition holds for n={n}, m={m}")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
