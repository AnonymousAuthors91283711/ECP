This problem involves finding real numbers a, h, k such that the quadratic equation holds for all x. We'll enumerate possible integer values for a, h, k within a reasonable range to find candidates that satisfy the equation.

The approach is:
1. Expand both sides of the equation
2. Compare coefficients of corresponding terms
3. Find integer solutions that satisfy all coefficient equations

```python
def main():
    # We'll search small integer values first
    for a in range(-5, 6):
        for h in range(-5, 6):
            for k in range(-30, 31):
                # Check if coefficients match when expanded
                # Left side: a(x-2)(x+4) = a(x² + 2x - 8)
                # Right side: 2(x-h)² + k = 2x² -4hx + 2h² + k
                
                # Compare x² coefficient: a = 2
                if a != 2:
                    continue
                
                # Compare x coefficient: 2a = -4h => 4 = -4h => h = -1
                if 2*a != -4*h:
                    continue
                
                # Compare constant term: -8a = 2h² + k => -16 = 2 + k => k = -18
                if -8*a != 2*h**2 + k:
                    continue
                
                print(f"Found solution: a={a}, h={h}, k={k}")
    
    print("Search complete")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
