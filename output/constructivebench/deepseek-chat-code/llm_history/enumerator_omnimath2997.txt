[write_program]
This problem is a simple fraction evaluation where we need to compute 8 divided by the sum (5+7+8). The answer is a rational number that can be simplified. The Python program will compute this exact value.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Compute 8 / (5 + 7 + 8) as exact fraction
numerator = 8
denominator = 5 + 7 + 8
result = Fraction(numerator, denominator)

# Output the simplified fraction
print(result)
```
