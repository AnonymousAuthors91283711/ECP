This problem involves finding the smallest positive real number w such that the integral of the ceiling function squared from 0 to w equals 20√7. We need to find ⌈2w⌉ for this w.

The approach is to:
1. Break the integral into intervals where the ceiling function is constant
2. For each integer n, compute the integral from n-1 to n (where ceiling is n)
3. Sum these integrals until we reach 20√7
4. Find the exact w where the sum equals 20√7
5. Compute ⌈2w⌉

Here's the Python program to enumerate possible values:

```python
import math

def find_w():
    target = 20 * math.sqrt(7)
    current_sum = 0.0
    n = 1
    while True:
        # Integral from n-1 to n of n^2 is n^2 * (n - (n-1)) = n^2
        current_sum += n**2
        if current_sum >= target:
            break
        n += 1
    
    # Now find the exact w where the integral equals target
    # Sum up to n-1 terms, then solve for remaining part
    partial_sum = sum(k**2 for k in range(1, n))
    remaining = target - partial_sum
    w = (n-1) + math.sqrt(remaining)/n
    
    ceil_2w = math.ceil(2 * w)
    print(f"Found w = {w}")
    print(f"⌈2w⌉ = {ceil_2w}")
    return ceil_2w

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_w()
```
