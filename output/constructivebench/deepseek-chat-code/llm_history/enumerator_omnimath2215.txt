This problem involves finding the value of a quartic polynomial P at x=1, given its evaluations at x=5, 11, and 17. The polynomial has integer coefficients and is given in a specific form. We'll approach this by:

1. Setting up the polynomial with unknown coefficients a, b, c
2. Creating equations from the evaluation conditions
3. Solving the system of equations to find a, b, c
4. Evaluating P(1) with the found coefficients

We'll use small integer ranges for the coefficients since the evaluations suggest they're likely small integers.

```python
def main():
    # We'll search for coefficients a, b, c that satisfy all conditions
    # Using reasonable bounds based on the evaluation values
    for a in range(-100, 101):
        for b in range(-1000, 1001):
            for c in range(-10000, 10001):
                # Check P(5) = 11
                p5 = 5**4 - 29*(5**3) + a*(5**2) + b*5 + c
                if p5 != 11:
                    continue
                
                # Check P(11) = 17
                p11 = 11**4 - 29*(11**3) + a*(11**2) + b*11 + c
                if p11 != 17:
                    continue
                
                # Check P(17) = 23
                p17 = 17**4 - 29*(17**3) + a*(17**2) + b*17 + c
                if p17 != 23:
                    continue
                
                # If all conditions satisfied, compute and print P(1)
                p1 = 1**4 - 29*(1**3) + a*(1**2) + b*1 + c
                print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, P(1)={p1}")
                return  # Stop after first valid solution
    
    print("No solution found in search range")
