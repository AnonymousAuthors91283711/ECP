[write_program]
This problem asks for the set of prime numbers p where there exist positive integers x and y such that the equation x*(y² - p) + y*(x² - p) = 5*p holds. We'll write a Python program to search for such primes p by enumerating possible values of x and y for small primes p.

The approach:
1. Iterate through small prime numbers p
2. For each p, search possible x and y values (up to a reasonable bound)
3. Check if the equation is satisfied
4. Output primes p that satisfy the condition

```python
import sympy

def find_valid_primes(max_p=100):
    """Find primes p where the equation has positive integer solutions x,y"""
    for p in sympy.primerange(2, max_p + 1):
        found = False
        # We'll search x and y up to 5*p as a reasonable bound
        max_xy = 5 * p
        for x in range(1, max_xy + 1):
            for y in range(1, max_xy + 1):
                lhs = x * (y**2 - p) + y * (x**2 - p)
                if lhs == 5 * p:
                    print(f"Found p={p} with (x,y)=({x},{y})")
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Searching for primes p where the equation has solutions:")
    find_valid_primes(100)
```
