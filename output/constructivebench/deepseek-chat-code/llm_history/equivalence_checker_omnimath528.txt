Ground Truth Answer: 4041
Proposed Answer: 2^(2 * 2021 - 1) + 2^(2021)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting valid sequences of functions from Fin 4 → ℤ with certain constraints. The valid_sequence definition imposes that:
   - Starts with all zeros
   - Each step changes exactly 4 coordinates by ±1 (since the sum of squared differences is 4)
   - Each function in the sequence must have values in {-1,0,1}

2. The ground truth answer is 4041, which suggests a linear relationship with the input parameter 2021.

3. The proposed answer is an exponential expression: 2^(2*2021-1) + 2^2021, which grows much faster than linear.

4. For n=2021, the proposed answer evaluates to an enormous number (approximately 2^4041), while the ground truth is just 4041.

The proposed answer is clearly incorrect as it doesn't match the scale or nature of the ground truth answer. The exponential form suggests a misunderstanding of the problem's combinatorial nature.
