Ground Truth Answer: {(-1, 1)}
Proposed Answer: { (x, y) | ∃ (t : ℝ), y = (-2 * x + 1 + t * Real.sqrt (-3 * x^2 - 6 * x - 3)) / 2 ∧ -3 * x^2 - 6 * x - 3 ≥ 0 ∧ (t = 1 ∨ t = -1) }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The original equation is: (x + y)² = (x + 1)(y - 1)
2. Expanding both sides:
   x² + 2xy + y² = xy - x + y - 1
3. Simplifying:
   x² + xy + y² + x - y + 1 = 0

The ground truth answer is simply {(-1, 1)}. Let's verify this:
For x = -1, y = 1:
(-1 + 1)² = 0 = (-1 + 1)(1 - 1) = 0 ✔

The proposed answer is much more complex, describing a parametric solution involving square roots. However, if we examine the discriminant (-3x² -6x -3), we can see:
-3x² -6x -3 = -3(x² + 2x + 1) = -3(x + 1)²
This is always ≤ 0, and only = 0 when x = -1.

When x = -1, the proposed solution reduces to y = (-2*(-1) + 1 + t*0)/2 = (2 + 1)/2 = 1.5, which doesn't match the ground truth (y should be 1).

Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect. The only solution is indeed (-1, 1).
