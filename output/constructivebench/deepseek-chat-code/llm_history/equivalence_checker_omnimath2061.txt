Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 102
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n where:
   - n > 0
   - (n + 1)/(2n + 1) < 1/100

2. Let's solve the inequality:
   (n + 1)/(2n + 1) < 1/100
   100(n + 1) < 2n + 1
   100n + 100 < 2n + 1
   98n < -99
   n < -99/98

This suggests there are no positive integers satisfying the inequality, which contradicts both answers. However, let's test the proposed values:

For n=6 (ground truth):
(6 + 1)/(12 + 1) = 7/13 ≈ 0.538 > 1/100

For n=102 (proposed answer):
(102 + 1)/(204 + 1) = 103/205 ≈ 0.502 > 1/100

Both answers are incorrect as they don't satisfy the inequality. However, the inequality has no solution in positive integers, so both answers are wrong in the same way.
