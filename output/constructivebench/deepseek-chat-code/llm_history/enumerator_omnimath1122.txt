This problem involves calculating a probability expression with binomial coefficients and fractions. The expression is:

(6 choose 4) * (2/3)^5 * (1/3)^2 + (6 choose 4) * (1/3)^5 * (2/3)^2

We'll compute this exactly in Python using fractions to avoid floating-point approximations. The program will calculate and print the exact fractional value.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from math import comb

def main():
    # Calculate the first term: C(6,4) * (2/3)^5 * (1/3)^2
    term1 = comb(6, 4) * (Fraction(2, 3)**5) * (Fraction(1, 3)**2)
    
    # Calculate the second term: C(6,4) * (1/3)^5 * (2/3)^2
    term2 = comb(6, 4) * (Fraction(1, 3)**5) * (Fraction(2, 3)**2)
    
    # Sum the terms and print the exact fraction
    result = term1 + term2
    print(f"Exact value: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
