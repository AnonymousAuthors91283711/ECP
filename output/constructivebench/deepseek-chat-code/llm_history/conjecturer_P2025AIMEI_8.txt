<<<5 / 2>>> 

Explanation: The problem describes a set S of real numbers k where there exists a unique complex z satisfying two distance conditions. The pattern suggests the solution is the midpoint between the real parts of the two fixed points (4 and 0), giving k = (4+0)/2 = 2. However, considering the imaginary component shift (3I), the correct answer is 5/2.
