[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of logarithmic equations with positive real variables x and y. We'll write a Python program to numerically search for solutions by testing values of x and y that satisfy both equations.

The approach:
1. Convert the logarithmic equations to exponential form for easier computation
2. Iterate through possible x values in a reasonable range (1-1000)
3. For each x, solve for y using both equations and check consistency
4. Print any (x,y) pairs that satisfy both equations within a small tolerance

```python
import math

def solve_system():
    # We'll search for x in 1 to 1000 with small steps
    for x in [i * 0.01 for i in range(100, 100001)]:
        try:
            # First equation: log10(x^3) + log10(y^2) = 11
            # => log10(x^3 * y^2) = 11 => x^3 * y^2 = 10^11
            # => y^2 = 10^11 / x^3 => y = sqrt(10^11 / x^3)
            y1 = math.sqrt(10**11 / x**3)
            
            # Second equation: log10(x^2) - log10(y^3) = 3
            # => log10(x^2 / y^3) = 3 => x^2 / y^3 = 10^3
            # => y^3 = x^2 / 10^3 => y = (x^2 / 10^3)^(1/3)
            y2 = (x**2 / 10**3)**(1/3)
            
            # Check if both y values agree within tolerance
            if abs(y1 - y2) < 1e-8:
                print(f"Found solution: x = {x}, y = {y1}")
                return  # Remove this line to find all solutions
        except:
            continue  # Skip invalid values (negative roots etc.)

    solve_system()
