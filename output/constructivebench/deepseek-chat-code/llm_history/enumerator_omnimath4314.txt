[write_program]
This problem asks to find all positive integer triples (x,y,z) such that 3^x - 5^y = z^2. We'll write a Python program to search for such triples by enumerating possible values of x and y, then checking if the difference is a perfect square.

The approach:
1. Iterate x from 1 to a reasonable limit (we'll use 20)
2. For each x, iterate y from 1 to a limit where 5^y < 3^x
3. Calculate 3^x - 5^y and check if it's a perfect square
4. Print any valid triples found

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    if n < 0:
        return False
    root = math.isqrt(n)
    return root * root == n

max_x = 20
print(f"Searching for solutions with x up to {max_x}")

found = False
for x in range(1, max_x + 1):
    max_y = int(x * math.log(3) / math.log(5)) + 1
    for y in range(1, max_y + 1):
        z_squared = 3**x - 5**y
        if z_squared <= 0:
            continue
        if is_perfect_square(z_squared):
            z = math.isqrt(z_squared)
            print(f"Found solution: (x={x}, y={y}, z={z})")
            found = True

if not found:
    print("No solutions found in the search range")
```
