This problem is about finding the smallest number n such that for any function f mapping n elements and 10 colors to boolean values, there exists a subset of 57 elements where either all elements agree on some pair of colors, or all disagree on some pair of colors. This resembles Ramsey-type problems.

We'll approach this by:
1. Modeling the problem as checking all possible colorings for small n
2. Finding the minimal n where the condition holds for all colorings
3. Using symmetry to reduce computation (since colors are interchangeable)

```python
from itertools import product

def check_condition(n, subset_size=57):
    # We'll represent colorings as tuples of 10 bits (colors) for each of n elements
    # For small n, we can enumerate all possible colorings (though this becomes impractical quickly)
    # Instead, we'll use a probabilistic approach for larger n
    
    # For demonstration, we'll check small n values
    # In reality, this needs more sophisticated methods for larger n
    for n_candidate in range(1, 20):
        # Generate all possible colorings for n_candidate elements
        # Each coloring is a tuple of 10 booleans for each element
        # We'll use binary representation to enumerate
        found_counterexample = False
        
        # Check a sample of colorings (full enumeration is too expensive)
        sample_size = min(1000, 2**(10*n_candidate))
        for coloring_num in range(sample_size):
            # Generate a coloring
            coloring = []
            for elem in range(n_candidate):
                color_bits = [(coloring_num >> (10*elem + c)) & 1 for c in range(10)]
                coloring.append(tuple(color_bits))
            
            # Check if condition holds for this coloring
            condition_met = False
            for i in range(10):
                for j in range(i+1, 10):
                    # Check if there's a subset of size 57 where all agree or disagree
                    # We'll look for the majority case
                    count_agree = sum(1 for elem in range(n_candidate) if coloring[elem][i] == coloring[elem][j])
                    if count_agree >= subset_size or (n_candidate - count_agree) >= subset_size:
                        condition_met = True
                        break
                if condition_met:
                    break
            
            if not condition_met:
                found_counterexample = True
                break
        
        if not found_counterexample or n_candidate == sample_size:
            print(f"Condition holds for n = {n_candidate}")
        else:
            print(f"Counterexample found for n = {n_candidate}")

# Run with reasonable parameters
check_condition(57)
```
