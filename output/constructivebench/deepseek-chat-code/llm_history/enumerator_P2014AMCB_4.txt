[write_program]
This problem involves solving a linear equation relating two variables m and b, where both are positive rational numbers. The equation simplifies to finding the ratio m/b that satisfies the given condition. We'll write a Python program to explore possible rational ratios m/b that satisfy the equation.

The equation simplifies as follows:
(4m + 3b)*2 = 2m + 16b
8m + 6b = 2m + 16b
6m = 10b
m = (10/6)b = (5/3)b

The program will verify this by testing small integer values for b and computing corresponding m values that satisfy the equation.

```python
def solve_equation():
    # We'll test small denominators from 1 to 10
    for denominator in range(1, 11):
        for numerator in range(1, 21):
            m = numerator
            b = denominator
            # Check if the equation holds
            left = (4 * m + 3 * b) * 2
            right = 2 * m + 16 * b
            if left == right:
                print(f"Found solution: m = {m}/{b} * b")
                # Simplify the fraction
                from math import gcd
                common_divisor = gcd(m, denominator)
                simplified_num = m // common_divisor
                simplified_den = denominator // common_divisor
                print(f"Simplified ratio: {simplified_num}/{simplified_den}")
                return  # We can stop after finding the first solution
    
    print("No solution found in the tested range")
