[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number `n > 20` that satisfies two conditions:
1. `13 + (n - 20)/4 = n/2`
2. `(n - 20)` is divisible by 4

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of `n` starting from 21 upwards, checking these conditions. The program will stop at the first valid solution since we're looking for the smallest such `n`.

```python
def find_min_n():
    n = 21
    while True:
        # Check if (n-20) is divisible by 4
        if (n - 20) % 4 == 0:
            # Calculate left and right sides of the equation
            left = 13 + (n - 20) // 4
            right = n // 2
            if left == right:
                print(f"Found solution: n = {n}")
                print(f"Verification: 13 + ({n}-20)/4 = {left}, {n}/2 = {right}")
                return
        n += 1

print("Searching for smallest n > 20 satisfying the conditions:")
find_min_n()
```
