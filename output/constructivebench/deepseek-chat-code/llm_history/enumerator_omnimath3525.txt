[write_program]
This problem involves finding all prime numbers p that appear in at least 7 triples (t0, t1, t2) of primes where the quadratic equation t0*xÂ² + t1*x + t2 = 0 has a rational solution. We'll write a Python program to enumerate such primes by checking all possible prime triples up to a reasonable limit.

The approach:
1. Generate all prime triples (p, q, r) up to a threshold (we'll use 100)
2. For each triple, check if the discriminant is a perfect square (indicating rational roots)
3. Count how many times each prime appears in valid triples
4. Output primes that appear in at least 7 valid triples

import math
from itertools import product

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]:
        if n % p == 0:
            return n == p
    d = n - 1
    s = 0
    while d % 2 == 0:
        d //= 2
        s += 1
    for a in [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]:
        if a >= n:
            continue
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(s - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False
    return True

def is_square(n):
    if n < 0:
        return False
    s = int(math.isqrt(n))
    return s * s == n

def main():
    threshold = 100
    primes = [p for p in range(2, threshold) if is_prime(p)]
    prime_counts = {p: 0 for p in primes}
    
    for t0, t1, t2 in product(primes, repeat=3):
        discriminant = t1 * t1 - 4 * t0 * t2
        if is_square(discriminant):
            prime_counts[t0] += 1
            prime_counts[t1] += 1
            prime_counts[t2] += 1
    
    print("Primes appearing in at least 7 valid triples:")
    for p in sorted(prime_counts):
        if prime_counts[p] >= 7:
            print(p)

    main()
