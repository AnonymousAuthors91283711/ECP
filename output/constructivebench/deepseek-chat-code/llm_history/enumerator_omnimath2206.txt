This problem asks for the minimum value of the expression involving trigonometric functions. To approach this, we'll enumerate possible values by sampling angles α and β in small increments, compute the expression, and track the minimum value found.

The key steps are:
1. Sample α and β from 0 to 2π in small increments
2. Compute the expression for each combination
3. Track and print the minimum value found

We'll use numpy for trigonometric functions and efficient computation.

```python
import numpy as np

def compute_expression(alpha, beta):
    term1 = (2 * np.cos(alpha) + 5 * np.sin(beta) - 8) ** 2
    term2 = (2 * np.sin(alpha) + 5 * np.cos(beta) - 15) ** 2
    return term1 + term2

def find_min_value():
    min_value = float('inf')
    # Sample in steps of 0.01 radians for reasonable precision
    steps = np.arange(0, 2*np.pi, 0.01)
    for alpha in steps:
        for beta in steps:
            current = compute_expression(alpha, beta)
            if current < min_value:
                min_value = current
                print(f"New minimum found: {min_value:.6f} at α={alpha:.2f}, β={beta:.2f}")
    print(f"\nFinal minimum value: {min_value:.6f}")

find_min_value()
```
