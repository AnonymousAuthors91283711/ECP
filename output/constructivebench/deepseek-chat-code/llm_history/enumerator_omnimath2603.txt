[write_program]
This problem involves counting certain constrained functions and computing a ratio. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible functions f: Fin m → Finset (Fin n) under the given constraints and compute the required ratio.

Key constraints:
1. For each i, f(i) has exactly k elements (cardinality k)
2. For each i, if x ∈ f(i) then (x+1) mod n ∈ f(i) (circular consecutive condition)
3. We need to count functions where there exists at least one x not in any f(i)

We'll implement this for n=10, k=5, m=4 as specified.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def main():
    n = 10
    k = 5
    m = 4
    
    # Generate all possible circular consecutive k-subsets of [0..n-1]
    def generate_subsets():
        subsets = []
        for start in range(n):
            subset = [(start + i) % n for i in range(k)]
            subsets.append(frozenset(subset))
        return subsets
    
    subsets = generate_subsets()
    total_functions = len(subsets) ** m
    
    # Count functions where at least one element is missing from all subsets
    count = 0
    for x in range(n):
        # Subsets that don't contain x
        valid_subsets = [s for s in subsets if x not in s]
        count += len(valid_subsets) ** m
    
    # Using inclusion-exclusion to avoid overcounting
    # We'll subtract cases where multiple elements are missing
    for a in range(n):
        for b in range(a+1, n):
            valid_subsets = [s for s in subsets if a not in s and b not in s]
            count -= len(valid_subsets) ** m
    
    # Add back triple intersections
    for a in range(n):
        for b in range(a+1, n):
            for c in range(b+1, n):
                valid_subsets = [s for s in subsets if a not in s and b not in s and c not in s]
                count += len(valid_subsets) ** m
    
    # Subtract quadruple intersections
    for a in range(n):
        for b in range(a+1, n):
            for c in range(b+1, n):
                for d in range(c+1, n):
                    valid_subsets = [s for s in subsets if a not in s and b not in s and c not in s and d not in s]
                    count -= len(valid_subsets) ** m
    
    # Compute the ratio and scale by 10000
    ratio = (count / total_functions) * 10000
    print(f"Computed value: {ratio}")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
