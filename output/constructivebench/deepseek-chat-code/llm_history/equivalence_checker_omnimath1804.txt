Ground Truth Answer: 3970
Proposed Answer: 2^6 * 2^6 - 2 * 2^6 + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting the number of 6×6 binary matrices that can be expressed as an outer product of two binary vectors (one row vector and one column vector).

2. The ground truth answer is 3970.

3. The proposed answer is 2^6 * 2^6 - 2 * 2^6 + 1 = 4096 - 128 + 1 = 3969.

The calculation:
- Total possible pairs of vectors: 2^6 * 2^6 = 4096
- Subtract cases where one vector is all zeros (2 * 2^6 = 128, since either row or column vector could be all zeros)
- Add back 1 because we subtracted the all-zeros case twice (when both vectors are all zeros)

However, 3969 ≠ 3970, so the answers are not equivalent. The proposed answer is missing one case - likely the case where both vectors are all ones, but this is already counted in the general case.
