[write_program]
This problem involves finding a probability function p(n) defined recursively for n from 0 to 10, with boundary conditions p(0)=0 and p(10)=1. The recursive relation is given for n from 1 to 9. We need to compute p(1).

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Set up the system of equations implied by the recursive relation
2. Solve the linear system to find all p(n) values
3. Output p(1) as the answer

The approach uses linear algebra since the recursive relations form a tridiagonal system that can be solved efficiently.

```python
import numpy as np

def solve_p():
    # We have 11 variables p[0] to p[10]
    # p[0] = 0 and p[10] = 1 are known
    # For n=1 to 9, the equation is:
    # p[n] = (n/10)*p[n-1] + (1 - n/10)*p[n+1]
    # Rearranged: (n/10)*p[n-1] - p[n] + (1 - n/10)*p[n+1] = 0
    
    # Create coefficient matrix A and right-hand side b
    A = np.zeros((9, 9))  # for p[1] to p[9]
    b = np.zeros(9)
    
    # p[0] = 0, p[10] = 1
    for n in range(1, 10):
        row = n-1  # 0-based index for equations
        coeff = n/10
        if n > 1:
            A[row, n-2] = coeff  # p[n-1] term
        A[row, n-1] = -1         # p[n] term
        if n < 9:
            A[row, n] = 1 - coeff # p[n+1] term
        else:
            # For n=9, p[n+1] is p[10]=1
            b[row] = -(1 - coeff) * 1
    
    # Solve the system
    p = np.linalg.solve(A, b)
    
    # p[1] is the first element (index 0)
    print(f"p(1) = {p[0]}")

solve_p()
