This problem involves finding the value of `a + b` given two conditions on a linear function `f(x) = a*x + b`:
1. The function is linear
2. It satisfies the functional equation `f(b*x + a) = x` for all x

We'll enumerate possible values of `a` and `b` that satisfy these conditions, then compute `a + b`. The solution involves solving the functional equation by substituting the linear form into it.

```python
def solve_functional_equation():
    # We'll try rational values for a and b to find exact solutions
    for numerator_a in range(-10, 11):
        for denominator_a in range(1, 11):
            a = numerator_a / denominator_a
            for numerator_b in range(-10, 11):
                for denominator_b in range(1, 11):
                    b = numerator_b / denominator_b
                    # The functional equation f(bx + a) = x becomes:
                    # a*(b*x + a) + b = x
                    # This must hold for all x, so we can equate coefficients
                    # Coefficient of x: a*b = 1
                    # Constant term: a*a + b = 0
                    if abs(a * b - 1) < 1e-9 and abs(a * a + b) < 1e-9:
                        print(f"Found solution: a = {a}, b = {b}, a+b = {a+b}")
                        return  # We can stop after finding the first valid solution
    print("No solution found in the searched range")
