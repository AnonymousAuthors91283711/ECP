The problem asks to find the maximum value of log₂(y) given the constraints x^y = 2^64 and (log₂x)^(log₂y) = 2^7, where x,y > 0. We'll approach this by:

1. Let a = log₂x and b = log₂y
2. Rewrite the equations in terms of a and b
3. Solve the system to find possible b values
4. Identify the maximum b

We'll enumerate possible integer values around the expected solution space to find candidates.

```python
import math

def solve():
    # Let a = log2(x), b = log2(y)
    # From x^y = 2^64 => y*log2(x) = 64 => a*b = 64
    # From (log2 x)^(log2 y) = 2^7 => a^b = 128
    
    # We need to find a,b > 0 satisfying:
    # 1. a*b = 64
    # 2. a^b = 128
    
    # Try integer factors first
    max_b = 0
    for b in range(1, 65):
        if 64 % b != 0:
            continue
        a = 64 / b
        if abs(a**b - 128) < 1e-6:  # Account for floating point precision
            print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}")
            if b > max_b:
                max_b = b
    
    # Also check non-integer solutions near the integer candidates
    # Using Newton's method to refine solutions
    def f(b):
        a = 64/b
        return a**b - 128
    
    def df(b):
        a = 64/b
        term1 = a**b * math.log(a)
        term2 = a**b * b * (-64)/(b**2)/a
        return term1 + term2
    
    # Initial guesses around integer solutions
    for guess in [2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0]:
        b = guess
        for _ in range(20):  # Newton iterations
            b = b - f(b)/df(b)
        if abs(f(b)) < 1e-6 and b > 0:
            print(f"Refined solution: b={b}")
            if b > max_b:
                max_b = b
    
    print(f"Maximum log2(y) found: {max_b}")

solve()
