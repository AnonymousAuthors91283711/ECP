This problem is about finding the largest domain D where a function f satisfies the functional equation f(x) + f(1/x) = x for all x ∈ D, with the condition that D is closed under x ↦ 1/x. We'll enumerate possible candidates for D by testing small rational values and their reciprocals.

The approach is:
1. Start with a seed value (like 1)
2. Generate its orbit under x ↦ 1/x
3. Check if the functional equation can be satisfied for all pairs (x,1/x)
4. Look for patterns in valid domains

```python
def generate_orbit(x):
    """Generate the orbit of x under reciprocal operation, avoiding duplicates"""
    orbit = set()
    current = x
    while current not in orbit:
        orbit.add(current)
        current = 1/current
    return sorted(orbit)

def test_domain(orbit):
    """Check if functional equation can be satisfied for all pairs in orbit"""
    n = len(orbit)
    # We need to assign f(x) for each x in orbit satisfying f(x) + f(1/x) = x
    # This requires consistent assignments
    if n % 2 != 0:
        return False  # Odd length orbits can't satisfy the equation
    
    # For even length, we can assign values alternately
    # For example, for {a,1/a}, f(a) can be arbitrary, f(1/a) = a - f(a)
    return True

# Test with various seed values
seeds = [1, 2, 0.5, -1, 1.5, (1+5**0.5)/2]  # Including golden ratio

for x in seeds:
    orbit = generate_orbit(x)
    if test_domain(orbit):
        print(f"Valid domain candidate: {orbit}")

# Special case: {-1,1} orbit
print("\nSpecial case testing:")
special_orbit = [-1, 1]
if test_domain(special_orbit):
    print(f"Valid special orbit: {special_orbit}")

# The maximal domain would be the union of all valid orbits
print("\nThe maximal domain appears to be R\{0} or some symmetric subset")
```
