theorem olympiadbench3024 (T : ℕ) (hT : T = 55) (K : ℕ) :
  (20 < T - 5 ∧ T - 5 < K) ∧
  ∃ r : ℚ, r > 1 ∧ (20 : ℚ) * r = (T - 5 : ℚ) ∧ (T - 5 : ℚ) * r = K ∧
  (19 < K ∧ K < 4 * T + 11) ∧
  ∃ d : ℤ, d > 0 ∧ (19 : ℤ) + d = K ∧ K + d = 4 * T + 11
  ↔ K = olympiadbench3024_answer T := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found valid K: 125. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
From the problem constraints and enumerated answer (K=125 when T=55), we can observe that:
1. The condition (T-5)*r = K suggests a quadratic relationship
2. The arithmetic progression condition gives d = K-19 and 4T+11-K = d
3. Solving these gives K = (4T+11+19)/2 = (4T+30)/2 = 2T+15
