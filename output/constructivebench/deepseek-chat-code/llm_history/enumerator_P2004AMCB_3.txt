[write_program]
This problem asks to find the sum x+y where x and y are positive integers satisfying 2^x * 3^y = 1296. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible (x,y) pairs that satisfy this equation and compute their sums.

The approach is:
1. Factorize 1296 to understand its prime factors (2^4 * 3^4)
2. Enumerate all possible exponents x and y where 2^x * 3^y = 1296
3. For each valid pair, compute x+y
4. Since the problem suggests there's a unique answer, we'll print all sums found (which should be identical)

```python
def solve():
    target = 1296
    max_power = 20  # arbitrary upper bound for exponents
    
    # Find all (x,y) pairs where 2^x * 3^y = 1296
    solutions = []
    for x in range(1, max_power + 1):
        remainder = target / (2 ** x)
        if remainder == int(remainder):
            y = 0
            temp = int(remainder)
            while temp % 3 == 0 and temp > 1:
                temp = temp // 3
                y += 1
            if temp == 1 and y > 0:
                solutions.append((x, y))
    
    # Print all solutions and their sums
    for x, y in solutions:
        print(f"x={x}, y={y}, x+y={x+y}")
    
    # Since the problem implies a unique answer, we can output the sum
    if solutions:
        print(f"All solutions have x+y={solutions[0][0]+solutions[0][1]}")

solve()
```
