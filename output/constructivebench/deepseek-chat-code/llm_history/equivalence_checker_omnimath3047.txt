Ground Truth Answer: 28
Proposed Answer: 40
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer step by step:

1. Total games = 60
2. Games per pair = 60 / 3 = 20 (since there are 3 pairs)
3. For Alvin vs Bingyi (AB):
   - Alvin wins 20% of 20 = 4 games
   - Bingyi wins 16 games (20-4)
4. For Bingyi vs Cheska (BC):
   - Bingyi wins 60% of 20 = 12 games
   - Cheska wins 8 games
5. For Cheska vs Alvin (CA):
   - Cheska wins 40% of 20 = 8 games
   - Alvin wins 12 games

Now calculating Bingyi's total wins:
- From AB: 16 wins
- From BC: 12 wins
- From CA: Bingyi doesn't play in CA games, so 0 wins
Total Bingyi wins = 16 + 12 + 0 = 28

The proposed answer is 40, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 28 as shown in the calculation.
