Ground Truth Answer: cos (π / 180) / (sin (π / 180))^2
Proposed Answer: 1 / (sin (π / 180) * tan (π / 180))
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. We can show this by simplifying the trigonometric identities:

1. Recall that tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x)
2. Substitute this into the proposed answer: 1/(sin(π/180) * (sin(π/180)/cos(π/180))) = cos(π/180)/(sin(π/180))^2
3. This matches exactly with the ground truth answer.

The transformation uses basic trigonometric identities and is valid for all angles where the denominators are non-zero (which is true for π/180). Therefore, the answers are equivalent.
