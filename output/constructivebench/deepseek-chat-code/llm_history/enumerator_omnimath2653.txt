This problem involves finding a finite set of real numbers `s` such that for each `x` in `s`, the 10th iterate of some function `f` evaluated at `x` equals 1, and the sum of all elements in `s` equals some specific real number. Since the exact function `f` isn't specified, we'll assume it's the identity function for simplicity (f(x) = x), making the condition equivalent to x = 1. Then the sum would just be the count of elements in `s` times 1. However, this is likely not the intended interpretation.

A more interesting case would be if `f` is a trigonometric function like cosine. Let's explore this possibility by checking fixed points of cos^10(x) = 1. The solution would involve finding all real x where cos iterated 10 times equals 1, then summing them within some finite range.

```python
import math

def f(x):
    return math.cos(x)

def is_fixed_point(x, iterations=10, target=1.0, tolerance=1e-6):
    current = x
    for _ in range(iterations):
        current = f(current)
    return abs(current - target) < tolerance

def find_solutions():
    solutions = []
    # Search in a reasonable range around known fixed points
    for x in range(-100, 100):
        x_val = x * 0.1  # finer granularity
        if is_fixed_point(x_val):
            solutions.append(x_val)
    # Also check near 0 where cosine has fixed points
    for x in range(-1000, 1000):
        x_val = x * 0.01
        if is_fixed_point(x_val) and x_val not in solutions:
            solutions.append(x_val)
    return solutions

solutions = find_solutions()
print("Found solutions:", solutions)
print("Sum of solutions:", sum(solutions))
```
