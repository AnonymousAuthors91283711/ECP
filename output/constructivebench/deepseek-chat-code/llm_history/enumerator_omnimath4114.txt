This problem involves finding the sum of the digits of the number 9*L² + 2*L where L is a number consisting of 2022 consecutive 1's (L = (10^2022 - 1)/9). Since 2022 is too large for direct computation, we'll look for a pattern by examining smaller cases where L has n consecutive 1's.

We'll compute the digit sum for n from 1 to a reasonable threshold (say 10) to identify a pattern. The program will calculate L, compute 9*L² + 2*L, then sum its digits for each n.

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

max_n = 10
print("n | digit_sum(9*L² + 2*L)")
print("-------------------------")
for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    L = int('1' * n)
    result = 9 * L * L + 2 * L
    s = digit_sum(result)
    print(f"{n} | {s}")

# After observing the pattern, we can conjecture the general formula
print("\nBased on the pattern, for n=2022 the sum would be 2022 * 2 = 4044")
```
