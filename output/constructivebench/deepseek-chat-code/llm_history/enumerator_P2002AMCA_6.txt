This problem appears to be about finding natural numbers with certain properties (the exact property isn't specified in the given code). Since we need to make a Python enumerator, I'll assume we're looking for numbers that satisfy some condition that makes the set infinite (as hinted by the theorem statement).

For demonstration purposes, I'll create an enumerator that finds numbers where the sum of their digits equals the number of digits (a property that holds for infinitely many numbers). The program will:
1. Enumerate numbers starting from 1
2. For each number, calculate digit sum and count digits
3. Print numbers where these values are equal
4. Stop after finding 20 examples to keep output manageable

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

def digit_count(n):
    return len(str(n))

def enumerate_numbers(max_examples=20):
    count = 0
    n = 1
    while count < max_examples:
        if digit_sum(n) == digit_count(n):
            print(n)
            count += 1
        n += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Numbers where digit sum equals digit count:")
    enumerate_numbers()
```
