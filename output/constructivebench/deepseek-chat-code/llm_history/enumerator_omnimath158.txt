The problem asks to find all pairs of positive integers (x, y) that satisfy the equation:
9*(x² + y² + 1) + 2*(3xy + 2) = 2005

We can simplify this equation and then enumerate possible solutions efficiently by bounding the possible values of x and y.

```python
def solve():
    # Simplify the equation: 9x² + 9y² + 9 + 6xy + 4 = 2005
    # => 9x² + 6xy + 9y² = 1992
    # => 3x² + 2xy + 3y² = 664
    
    # Since x and y are positive integers, we can bound the search space
    max_val = int((664 / 3)**0.5) + 2  # x² <= 664/3 => x <= ~14.9
    
    solutions = []
    for x in range(1, max_val + 1):
        for y in range(1, max_val + 1):
            if 3*x*x + 2*x*y + 3*y*y == 664:
                solutions.append((x, y))
                print((x, y))  # Stream solutions as found
    
    # Print all found solutions (including symmetric pairs)
    print("All solutions:", solutions)

solve()
```
