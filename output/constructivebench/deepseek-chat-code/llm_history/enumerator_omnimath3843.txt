This problem asks for the greatest natural number `d` that divides the product of `(n*k + 1)` for `k` from 0 to 16 (17 terms) for every `n` between 1 and 2016. 

To solve this computationally, we'll:
1. Find the minimal requirements by testing small `n` values
2. Compute the GCD of products for these test cases
3. Verify the candidate `d` works for all `n` up to 2016

The key insight is that the answer must be the GCD of products for small `n` values, since larger `n` values won't introduce new prime factors.

```python
import math
from functools import reduce
from itertools import count

def compute_product(n):
    """Compute product of (n*k + 1) for k=0..16"""
    product = 1
    for k in range(17):
        product *= (n * k + 1)
    return product

def find_gcd_of_products(max_n):
    """Find GCD of products for n=1..max_n"""
    current_gcd = compute_product(1)
    for n in range(2, max_n + 1):
        current_gcd = math.gcd(current_gcd, compute_product(n))
        if current_gcd == 1:
            break
    return current_gcd

# First find candidate by testing small n values
test_n = 10  # small sample sufficient to find the GCD
candidate = find_gcd_of_products(test_n)
print(f"GCD of products for n=1..{test_n}: {candidate}")

# Verify candidate works for all n up to 2016
verified = True
for n in range(1, 2017):
    if compute_product(n) % candidate != 0:
        verified = False
        break
if verified:
    print(f"Verified: {candidate} works for all n up to 2016")
else:
    print("Verification failed")
```
