[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that for every natural number m, there exists a subset of {1,2,...,n} whose product of elements is congruent to m modulo 100. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal n by checking for each n whether all residues mod 100 can be achieved.

The approach:
1. For each n starting from 1, generate all possible non-empty subsets of {1,...,n}
2. For each subset, compute the product modulo 100
3. Track which residues have been achieved
4. The first n where all residues 0-99 are achieved is our answer

```python
def solve():
    from itertools import combinations
    
    target_mod = 100
    required_residues = set(range(target_mod))
    
    n = 1
    while True:
        achieved = set()
        numbers = list(range(1, n+1))
        
        # Check all non-empty subsets
        for k in range(1, n+1):
            for subset in combinations(numbers, k):
                product = 1
                for num in subset:
                    product = (product * num) % target_mod
                    if product == 0:  # Optimization: 0 can't help achieve new residues
                        break
                achieved.add(product)
                if achieved == required_residues:
                    print(f"Found solution: n = {n}")
                    return
        
        print(f"Checked n = {n}, achieved {len(achieved)} residues")
        n += 1

solve()
```
