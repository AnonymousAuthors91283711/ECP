theorem omnimath4103
    (P : Polynomial ℝ) :
    (P ∈ omnimath4103_answer) ↔
    (∀ a b c : ℝ, a * b + b * c + c * a = 0 → P.eval (a - b) + P.eval (b - c) + P.eval (c - a) = 2 * P.eval (a + b + c)) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing constant polynomials:
P(x) = 0 works

Testing linear polynomials:
P(x) = 0x + 0 works

Testing quadratic polynomials:
P(x) = 1x² + 0x + 0 works
P(x) = -1x² + 0x + 0 works

Conjectured solutions:
P(x) = k (any constant)
P(x) = x² + k (any constant k)








. Expected Answer Type: Set (Polynomial ℝ)
<<<{P | ∃ k : ℝ, P = Polynomial.C k ∨ P = Polynomial.X ^ 2 + Polynomial.C k}>>>
