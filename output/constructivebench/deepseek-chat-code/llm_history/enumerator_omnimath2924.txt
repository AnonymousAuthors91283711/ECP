The problem asks for the smallest number ≥100000 that is divisible by all integers from 10 to 15. This is equivalent to finding the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers and then finding the smallest multiple of this LCM that is ≥100000.

Here's a Python program that:
1. Computes the LCM of numbers 10 through 15
2. Finds the smallest multiple of this LCM that is ≥100000
3. Verifies the solution by checking divisibility

```python
import math

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)

def compute_lcm(numbers):
    current_lcm = 1
    for num in numbers:
        current_lcm = lcm(current_lcm, num)
    return current_lcm

def find_smallest_multiple(lcm, threshold):
    remainder = threshold % lcm
    if remainder == 0:
        return threshold
    else:
        return threshold + (lcm - remainder)

def main():
    numbers = range(10, 16)
    threshold = 100000
    
    # Compute LCM of numbers 10-15
    numbers_lcm = compute_lcm(numbers)
    print(f"LCM of numbers 10-15: {numbers_lcm}")
    
    # Find smallest multiple ≥ threshold
    answer = find_smallest_multiple(numbers_lcm, threshold)
    print(f"Smallest number ≥{threshold} divisible by all: {answer}")
    
    # Verification
    for n in numbers:
        assert answer % n == 0, f"Failed divisibility by {n}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
