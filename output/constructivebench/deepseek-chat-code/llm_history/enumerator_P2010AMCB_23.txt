This problem involves finding two monic quadratic polynomials P and Q such that their compositions have specified roots, and then computing the sum of their minimum values. We'll enumerate possible P and Q polynomials that satisfy the root conditions.

The approach is:
1. Generate monic quadratic polynomials P and Q with unknown coefficients
2. Compute P(Q(x)) and Q(P(x)) symbolically
3. Check if their roots match the given sets
4. For valid pairs, compute the minimum values (vertex y-coordinates) and sum them

```python
from itertools import product
from sympy import symbols, Poly, Eq, solve, roots, re

def solve_problem():
    x = symbols('x')
    # Generate possible monic quadratic P and Q polynomials
    # P = x^2 + a1*x + a0, Q = x^2 + b1*x + b0
    a0, a1, b0, b1 = symbols('a0 a1 b0 b1')
    P = Poly(x**2 + a1*x + a0, x)
    Q = Poly(x**2 + b1*x + b0, x)
    
    # Compute compositions
    PQ = P.compose(Q)
    QP = Q.compose(P)
    
    # Required roots for P(Q(x)) and Q(P(x))
    pq_roots = [-23, -21, -17, -15]
    qp_roots = [-59, -57, -51, -49]
    
    # Coefficients of PQ and QP (as polynomials in x)
    # PQ = x^4 + ... + (a1*b0 + a0)
    # The sum of roots should equal -coefficient of x^3
    sum_pq = sum(pq_roots)
    sum_qp = sum(qp_roots)
    
    # From Vieta's formulas for PQ:
    # Sum of roots = - (2*b1 + a1) = sum_pq
    # Similarly for QP: sum_qp = - (2*a1 + b1)
    
    # Solve the system for a1 and b1
    a1_val, b1_val = solve([Eq(2*b1 + a1, -sum_pq), 
                           Eq(2*a1 + b1, -sum_qp)], (a1, b1)).values()
    
    # Now find a0 and b0 using product of roots
    # For PQ: product is a0 + a1*b0 + b0^2
    # For QP: product is b0 + b1*a0 + a0^2
    # We'll need to solve this system
    
    # Compute product of roots (note: for quartic (x-r1)...(x-r4), product is r1*r2*r3*r4)
    prod_pq = (-23)*(-21)*(-17)*(-15)
    prod_qp = (-59)*(-57)*(-51)*(-49)
    
    # Solve for a0 and b0
    solutions = solve([
        Eq(a0 + a1_val*b0 + b0**2, prod_pq),
        Eq(b0 + b1_val*a0 + a0**2, prod_qp)
    ], (a0, b0))
    
    # Filter real solutions
    real_solutions = [sol for sol in solutions if all(val.is_real for val in sol)]
    
    for sol in real_solutions:
        a0_val, b0_val = sol
        # Construct final polynomials
        P_final = Poly(x**2 + a1_val*x + a0_val, x)
        Q_final = Poly(x**2 + b1_val*x + b0_val, x)
        
        # Compute minimum values (vertex y-coordinates)
        p_min = P_final.eval(-a1_val/2)
        q_min = Q_final.eval(-b1_val/2)
        total = p_min + q_min
        
        print(f"Found solution:")
        print(f"P = {P_final}")
        print(f"Q = {Q_final}")
        print(f"Sum of minima: {total}\n")

Judgement Explanation:
The original program attempts to solve a system of equations to find monic quadratic polynomials P and Q that satisfy specific root conditions for their compositions. However, it fails to find any real solutions, resulting in an empty output. This suggests either:
1. The problem has no real solutions (unlikely for this competition problem)
2. The approach to solving the system is incomplete or incorrect

The main issues are:
1. The program doesn't properly handle all constraints from the root conditions
2. It only checks for real solutions but doesn't verify if they produce the exact required roots
3. The product of roots calculation might be incorrect for the composition case

The problem requires finding real monic quadratic polynomials P and Q where P(Q(x)) has roots {-23,-21,-17,-15} and Q(P(x)) has roots {-59,-57,-51,-49}, then computing the sum of their minima.

<<<False>>>

Here's a corrected version that properly handles the constraints and finds the solution:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Poly, Eq, solve, re

def solve_problem():
    x = symbols('x')
    a0, a1, b0, b1 = symbols('a0 a1 b0 b1')
    
    # Define monic quadratic polynomials
    P = Poly(x**2 + a1*x + a0, x)
    Q = Poly(x**2 + b1*x + b0, x)
    
    # Required roots
    pq_roots = [-23, -21, -17, -15]
    qp_roots = [-59, -57, -51, -49]
    
    # Sum and product of roots
    sum_pq = sum(pq_roots)
    sum_qp = sum(qp_roots)
    prod_pq = (-23)*(-21)*(-17)*(-15)
    prod_qp = (-59)*(-57)*(-51)*(-49)
    
    # Solve for a1 and b1 using linear equations from sum of roots
    a1_val, b1_val = solve([
        Eq(2*b1 + a1, -sum_pq),
        Eq(2*a1 + b1, -sum_qp)
    ], (a1, b1)).values()
    
    # Now solve for a0 and b0 using the full polynomial equations
    PQ = P.compose(Q)

Judgement:
The problem is a mathematical theorem from a competition (likely AMC) that involves finding two monic quadratic polynomials P and Q such that their compositions P(Q(x)) and Q(P(x)) have specified roots, and then evaluating the sum of their minima. The problem requires constructing P and Q, verifying their properties, and computing the sum of their minima.

Since no program was provided, it is impossible to judge its correctness or efficiency. The task requires a Python program to enumerate possible solutions, but none exists. Therefore, the submission must be rejected.

import numpy as np

# We need to find monic quadratic P and Q such that:
# P(Q(x)) has roots -23, -21, -17, -15
# Q(P(x)) has roots -59, -57, -51, -49

def find_polynomials():
    # Let P = x^2 + a x + b, Q = x^2 + c x + d
    # P(Q(x)) = (x^2 + c x + d)^2 + a(x^2 + c x + d) + b
    # This must equal (x+23)(x+21)(x+17)(x+15)
    # Similarly for Q(P(x))
    
    # Instead of symbolic computation, we'll try small integer values for a,b,c,d
    # since competition problems often have simple integer solutions
    
    # First, find possible P by looking at P(Q(x)) roots
    # The roots of P(Q(x)) are Q(r) where P(r)=0
