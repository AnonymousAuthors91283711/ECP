theorem omnimath1363 : 
  IsGreatest {k : ℕ | ∃ (p : Polynomial ℝ), 
    (∀ x : ℝ, eval x p ≠ 0) ∧ 
    (∀ i ∈ Finset.range 2011, coeff p i ∈ ({-1, 1} : Set ℝ)) ∧ 
    (coeff p 2010 = 1) ∧ 
    (k = Finset.card {i ∈ Finset.range 2010 | coeff p i = -1})} 
  omnimath1363_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Degree 1: Max -1 coefficients = 0
Degree 2: Max -1 coefficients = 1
Degree 3: Max -1 coefficients = 1
Degree 4: Max -1 coefficients = 2
