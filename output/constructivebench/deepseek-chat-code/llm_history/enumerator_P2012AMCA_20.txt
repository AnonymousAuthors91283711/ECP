[write_program]
This problem asks for the exponent k such that the coefficient of X^2012 in (1+X+X^2+...+X^7)^8 equals 2^k. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible k values by computing the polynomial expansion and checking coefficients.

The approach:
1. Represent the polynomial as (1-X^8)/(1-X) raised to the 8th power
2. Compute the coefficient using the multinomial theorem
3. Check which coefficients are powers of 2
4. For the specific X^2012 term, find the exponent k

```python
from math import comb
from itertools import product

def coefficient(n, k):
    """Compute coefficient of x^k in (1+x+...+x^7)^n using inclusion-exclusion"""
    total = 0
    for t in range(0, (k // 8) + 1):
        sign = (-1)**t
        remaining = k - 8*t
        if remaining < 0:
            continue
        # Multinomial coefficient for sum a_i = n where sum i*a_i = remaining
        # This is equivalent to compositions of remaining into n parts <=7
        # We use dynamic programming for this part
        dp = [0]*(remaining+1)
        dp[0] = 1
        for _ in range(n):
            new_dp = [0]*(remaining+1)
            for i in range(remaining+1):
                if dp[i] == 0:
                    continue
                for j in range(0, min(8, remaining-i+1)):
                    new_dp[i+j] += dp[i]
            dp = new_dp
        total += sign * comb(n, t) * dp[remaining]
    return total

def is_power_of_two(n):
    return (n & (n-1)) == 0 and n != 0

def find_exponent(n):
    k = 0
    while n % 2 == 0:
        n = n // 2
        k += 1
    return k if n == 1 else None

def main():
    n = 8
    target = 2012
    c = coefficient(n, target)
    print(f"Coefficient of x^{target}: {c}")
    k = find_exponent(c)
    if k is not None:
        print(f"Exponent k where coefficient equals 2^k: {k}")
    else:
        print("Coefficient is not a power of 2")
