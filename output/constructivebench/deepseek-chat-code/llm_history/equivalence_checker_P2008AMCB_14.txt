theorem P2008AMCB_14 (a b : ℝ) (ha : 0 < a ∧ a ≠ 1) (hb : 0 < b) 
  (h1 : log (a^2) > 0) (h2 : 2 * π * log (a^2) = log (b^4)) :

Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => π
Proposed Answer: fun a b => π / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. From the given conditions:
   - h1: log(a²) > 0 ⇒ 2log(a) > 0 ⇒ log(a) > 0
   - h2: 2π * log(a²) = log(b⁴) ⇒ 2π * 2log(a) = 4log(b) ⇒ πlog(a) = log(b)

2. We need to find log(b)/log(a):
   - From above, log(b) = πlog(a)
   - Therefore log(b)/log(a) = πlog(a)/log(a) = π

The ground truth answer correctly gives π, while the proposed answer gives π/2. The proposed answer is incorrect as it's missing a factor of 2 in the simplification process.
