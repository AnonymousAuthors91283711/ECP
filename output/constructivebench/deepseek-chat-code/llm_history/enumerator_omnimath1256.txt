The problem is to find the smallest integer n between 1000 and 2000 such that n ≡ 1 mod k for all k in {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}. This means n-1 must be divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. We'll compute the LCM first, then find the smallest n > 1000 that is 1 more than a multiple of this LCM.

```python
import math

def compute_lcm(numbers):
    lcm = 1
    for num in numbers:
        lcm = lcm * num // math.gcd(lcm, num)
    return lcm

def find_min_n():
    numbers = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
    lcm = compute_lcm(numbers)
    print(f"LCM of {numbers}: {lcm}")
    
    # Find smallest n > 1000 where n ≡ 1 mod lcm
    base = 1001  # Since we need n > 1000
    remainder = base % lcm
    if remainder == 1:
        n = base
    else:
        n = base + (lcm - remainder + 1) % lcm
    
    # Verify n is in range and satisfies all conditions
    while n < 2000:
        valid = True
        for k in numbers:
            if n % k != 1:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            print(f"Found valid n: {n}")
            return n
        n += lcm
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = find_min_n()
    print(f"Minimum n satisfying the conditions: {result}")
```
