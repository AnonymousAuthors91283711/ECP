Ground Truth Answer: fun m a b c i => 
    let S := a + b + c
    match i with
    | 0 => (1 / (m - 1)) * (c - S / (m + 2))
    | 1 => (1 / (m - 1)) * (b - S / (m + 2))
    | 2 => (1 / (m - 1)) * (a - S / (m + 2))
Proposed Answer: fun m a b c i => 
  if i = 0 then (a + b - (2 * m * c) - (m * b) + (m^2 * c)) / (m^2 + m - 2)
  else if i = 1 then ((m * a) - (2 * b) + (m * c)) / (m^2 + m - 2)
  else ((m^2 * a) + (m * b) - (2 * c)) / (m^2 + m - 2)
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. First, observe that both answers are functions taking m, a, b, c, and i as inputs and returning a real number.

2. The denominators:
- Ground truth: Uses (m-1) and (m+2) separately
- Proposed: Uses (m² + m - 2) which factors as (m-1)(m+2)
This part is equivalent since (m² + m - 2) = (m-1)(m+2)

3. For i=0:
Ground truth: (1/(m-1))*(c - (a+b+c)/(m+2))
= (c(m+2)-(a+b+c))/((m-1)(m+2))
= (cm+2c-a-b-c)/(denominator)
= (cm+c-a-b)/(denominator)

Proposed: (a + b - 2mc - mb + m²c)/(denominator)
This doesn't match the simplified ground truth form.

4. For i=1:
Ground truth: (1/(m-1))*(b - (a+b+c)/(m+2))
= (b(m+2)-(a+b+c))/(denominator)
= (bm+2b-a-b-c)/(denominator)
= (bm+b-a-c)/(denominator)

Proposed: (ma - 2b + mc)/(denominator)
This doesn't match the simplified ground truth form.

5. For i=2:
Ground truth: (1/(m-1))*(a - (a+b+c)/(m+2))
= (a(m+2)-(a+b+c))/(denominator)
= (am+2a-a-b-c)/(denominator)
= (am+a-b-c)/(denominator)

Proposed: (m²a + mb - 2c)/(denominator)
This doesn't match the simplified ground truth form.

The proposed answer doesn't simplify to match the ground truth answer in any of the cases. The expressions are fundamentally different.
