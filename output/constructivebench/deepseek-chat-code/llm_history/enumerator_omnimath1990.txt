[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number N > 2017 where the count of numbers less than N that start with digit '1' (when written in base 10) multiplied by 5 equals 2*N. We'll write a Python program to find this minimal N by checking numbers sequentially from 2018 upwards.

The approach:
1. For each candidate N starting from 2018
2. Count how many numbers < N start with '1'
3. Check if count*5 == 2*N
4. The first N satisfying this condition is our answer

```python
def count_numbers_starting_with_1(N):
    """Count numbers < N that start with digit 1 in base 10"""
    if N == 0:
        return 0
    s = str(N)
    first_digit = int(s[0])
    length = len(s)
    
    # Numbers with fewer digits than N
    count = 0
    for d in range(1, length):
        count += 9 ** (d - 1)  # First digit is 1, remaining d-1 digits can be 0-9
    
    # Numbers with same number of digits as N, starting with 1
    if first_digit > 1:
        count += 10 ** (length - 1)
    elif first_digit == 1:
        count += int(s[1:]) if length > 1 else 0
        count += 1  # for the number 1 followed by zeros
    
    return count

def find_minimal_N():
    N = 2018
    while True:
        count = count_numbers_starting_with_1(N)
        if 5 * count == 2 * N:
            print(f"Found solution: N = {N}")
            return N
        N += 1
        # Optional progress indicator for large searches
        if N % 1000 == 0:
            print(f"Checked up to N = {N}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_minimal_N()
```
