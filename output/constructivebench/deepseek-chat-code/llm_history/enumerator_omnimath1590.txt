[write_program]
This problem involves finding all integers `n` such that `1 + floor(100n/101) = ceil(99n/100)`. We'll write a Python program to enumerate solutions for small values of `n` to identify patterns or exact solutions.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible integer values of `n`
2. For each `n`, compute both sides of the equation
3. Print values of `n` that satisfy the equation
4. Stop after finding a reasonable number of solutions to observe the pattern

```python
import math

def find_solutions(max_n=100000):
    solutions = []
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        lhs = 1 + math.floor(100 * n / 101)
        rhs = math.ceil(99 * n / 100)
        if lhs == rhs:
            solutions.append(n)
            print(n)  # Stream solutions as found
    return solutions

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Solutions found:")
    sols = find_solutions()
    if sols:
        print(f"Total solutions found: {len(sols)}")
    else:
        print("No solutions found in the search range")
```
