This problem asks for the maximum possible salary (s) in a team of 21 players where:
1. Each player earns at least 15000
2. Total salaries sum to at most 700000
3. At least one player earns exactly s

To find the maximum possible s, we minimize all other salaries (15000) and maximize s:
s + 20*15000 ≤ 700000 → s ≤ 700000 - 300000 = 400000

Here's a Python program to verify this by checking values around the theoretical maximum:

```python
def find_max_salary():
    min_salary = 15000
    team_size = 21
    max_total = 700000
    
    # Calculate theoretical maximum
    theoretical_max = max_total - (team_size - 1) * min_salary
    
    # Verify by checking values around the theoretical max
    for s in range(theoretical_max - 5, theoretical_max + 1):
        if s + (team_size - 1) * min_salary <= max_total:
            print(f"Possible maximum salary: {s}")
    
    print(f"\nThe maximum possible salary is: {theoretical_max}")

find_max_salary()
```
