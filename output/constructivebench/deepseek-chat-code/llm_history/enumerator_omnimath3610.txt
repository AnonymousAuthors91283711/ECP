[write_program]
This problem asks to find all natural numbers n > 1 where the sum of the number of divisors of each divisor of n (sorted in increasing order) equals n itself. We'll write a Python program to enumerate such numbers up to a reasonable threshold.

The approach:
1. Generate all numbers n from 2 to a threshold (we'll use 10000)
2. For each n, get its divisors sorted in increasing order
3. For each divisor d in the sorted list, count its number of divisors
4. Sum these counts and check if it equals n
5. Print numbers that satisfy this condition

```python
import math

def get_divisors(n):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(n // i)
    return sorted(divisors)

def count_divisors(k):
    if k == 1:
        return 1
    count = 2  # 1 and k itself
    sqrt_k = int(math.sqrt(k))
    for i in range(2, sqrt_k + 1):
        if k % i == 0:
            count += 1 if i*i == k else 2
    return count

max_n = 10000
print(f"Searching for numbers up to {max_n} where sum of divisor counts equals the number itself:")
for n in range(2, max_n + 1):
    divisors = get_divisors(n)
    total = sum(count_divisors(d) for d in divisors)
    if total == n:
        print(n)
```
