Ground Truth Answer: -(1008 / 2017)
Proposed Answer: -(1/4) * (1 - 1/(2016 + 1))
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest lower bound (infimum) of a certain quadratic form involving a 2017-dimensional vector.

2. The ground truth answer is -1008/2017 ≈ -0.499752

3. The proposed answer is -(1/4)*(1 - 1/2017) = -1008/4034 ≈ -0.249876

The two answers are clearly different numerically (one is approximately -0.5, the other -0.25), and they are not algebraically equivalent. The proposed answer is incorrect.
