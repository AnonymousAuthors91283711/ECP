The problem asks to find all positive integers n where 111 mod n equals 6. We need to enumerate all such n values. The mathematical condition 111 % n = 6 is equivalent to n dividing (111 - 6) = 105 and n > 6 (since remainder must be less than divisor).

Here's a Python program that finds all positive integers n > 6 that divide 105:

```python
def find_divisors():
    target = 105  # 111 - 6
    divisors = set()
    # Find all divisors of 105 greater than 6
    for i in range(1, int(target**0.5) + 1):
        if target % i == 0:
            if i > 6:
                divisors.add(i)
            complement = target // i
            if complement > 6 and complement != i:
                divisors.add(complement)
    # Sort and print the divisors
    for n in sorted(divisors):
        print(n)
    # The count is the answer
    print(f"Total solutions: {len(divisors)}")

find_divisors()
```

The program first calculates all divisors of 105, then filters those greater than 6 (since the remainder must be less than the divisor). It prints each valid divisor and finally the count of such divisors. The output will show all numbers n satisfying the original condition.
