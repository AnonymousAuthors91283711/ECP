Ground Truth Answer: 257/16
Proposed Answer: (9/2 : ℝ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find the real value x ≥ 2 that satisfies the given equation involving square roots.

2. The ground truth answer is 257/16, which is approximately 16.0625.

3. The proposed answer is 9/2, which is 4.5.

Testing the proposed answer (x = 4.5):
- First term denominator: √4.5 + √(4.5-2) ≈ 2.121 + 1.581 ≈ 3.702
- Second term denominator: √(4.5+2) + √4.5 ≈ 2.550 + 2.121 ≈ 4.671
- Left side: 1/3.702 + 1/4.671 ≈ 0.270 + 0.214 ≈ 0.484
- Right side: 0.25
These are not equal (0.484 ≠ 0.25), so x=4.5 is not a solution.

Testing the ground truth (x=257/16≈16.0625):
- First term denominator: √16.0625 + √(16.0625-2) ≈ 4.008 + 3.752 ≈ 7.760
- Second term denominator: √(16.0625+2) + √16.0625 ≈ 4.253 + 4.008 ≈ 8.261
- Left side: 1/7.760 + 1/8.261 ≈ 0.129 + 0.121 ≈ 0.25
This matches the right side (0.25), confirming 257/16 is correct.

The proposed answer (9/2) does not satisfy the equation, while the ground truth (257/16) does.
