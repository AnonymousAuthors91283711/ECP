Ground Truth Answer: fun n => ⌊log 2 n⌋₊ + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n - 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal sum s where s is defined as the sum of a[i].val/(i.val+1) over all i in Fin n, for some bijective function a.

2. The ground truth answer suggests the minimal sum is floor(log₂ n) + 1. This makes sense because:
   - The minimal sum would occur when we pair the largest denominators with smallest numerators
   - This resembles harmonic numbers and their logarithmic growth

3. The proposed answer is n-1, which would be:
   - The sum of (n-1)/1 + (n-2)/2 + ... + 0/n
   - This is actually the maximal sum, not the minimal sum
   - It's obtained by reversing the optimal pairing

The proposed answer gives exactly the opposite of what's needed (max instead of min), and the values are completely different from the ground truth answer.
