[write_program]
The problem asks to count numbers n between 1 and 10^4 where the digit sum of 11*n equals twice the digit sum of n. We'll write a Python program to enumerate these numbers and count them.

Key observations:
1. We need to compute digit sums efficiently
2. We'll check all numbers from 1 to 10^4
3. For each number, we'll compute 11*n and compare digit sums

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

count = 0
for n in range(1, 10**4 + 1):
    if digit_sum(11 * n) == 2 * digit_sum(n):
        print(n)  # Stream found numbers
        count += 1

print("Total count:", count)
```
