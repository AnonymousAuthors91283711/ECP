Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2 * n)! * 2^(n^2)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 2^(2 * n^2 + n) * ∏ k in range n, (factorial (2 * k + 1) / (factorial k * 2^k))^2
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth and proposed answers.

The ground truth is: (2n)! * 2^(n²)
The proposed answer is: 2^(2n² + n) * ∏ product term

First, let's simplify the proposed answer:
1. The product term can be rewritten using properties of factorials and powers
2. The expression 2^(2n² + n) can be factored as 2^(n²) * 2^(n² + n)
3. The product term involves ratios of factorials that might simplify to (2n)!

However, when we compare the growth rates:
- Ground truth grows roughly like (2n)^(2n) * e^(-2n) * 2^(n²)
- Proposed answer grows roughly like 2^(2n²) * (2n)^(2n) (from the product term)

The dominant terms are:
- Ground truth: 2^(n²) * n^(2n)
- Proposed answer: 2^(2n²) * n^(2n)

The 2^(n²) vs 2^(2n²) difference shows these cannot be equivalent for n ≥ 1.
