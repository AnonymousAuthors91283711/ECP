This problem involves finding the minimal possible value of |z₁z₂ + z₃z₄| where z₁,z₂,z₃,z₄ are roots of the given quartic polynomial and we consider all permutations of the roots. We'll approach this by:

1. Finding all roots of the polynomial numerically
2. Generating all permutations of pairing the roots
3. Calculating |z₁z₂ + z₃z₄| for each pairing
4. Finding the minimal value

```python
import cmath
import itertools

# Define the polynomial and find its roots
coeffs = [16, 56, 52, 14, 1]  # coefficients from constant term to x^4
roots = [complex(root) for root in np.roots(coeffs)]

# Generate all unique pairings of the roots (3 distinct pairings)
pairings = []
for pairing in itertools.combinations(roots, 2):
    remaining = [r for r in roots if r not in pairing]
    pairings.append((pairing[0], pairing[1], remaining[0], remaining[1]))

# Calculate |z1z2 + z3z4| for each pairing and find minimum
min_value = float('inf')
for z1, z2, z3, z4 in pairings:
    value = abs(z1*z2 + z3*z4)
    print(f"Pairing: ({z1:.3f}, {z2:.3f}) + ({z3:.3f}, {z4:.3f}) → {value:.6f}")
    if value < min_value:
        min_value = value

print(f"\nMinimum value found: {min_value:.6f}")
```

Judgement:
1. The problem asks for the minimum value of |z1z2 + z3z4| where z1,z2,z3,z4 are roots of the given quartic polynomial, considering all permutations of the roots.
2. The original program has several issues:
   - It uses numpy.roots without importing numpy
   - It only considers combinations (not all permutations) of the roots
   - The pairings logic is incorrect as it doesn't cover all possible permutations
   - The output format doesn't match the requirements (streaming partial results)
3. The program fails to run due to missing numpy import, hence outputs empty result.

<<<False>>>

Here's the corrected program:

```python
import cmath
import itertools

# Define polynomial coefficients (x^4 + 14x^3 + 52x^2 + 56x + 16)
coeffs = [16, 56, 52, 14, 1]

# Find roots (using quadratic formula since polynomial factors as (x^2+6x+4)(x^2+8x+4))
a = 6
b = 8
c = 4
roots = [
    (-a + cmath.sqrt(a**2 - 4*c))/2,
    (-a - cmath.sqrt(a**2 - 4*c))/2,
    (-b + cmath.sqrt(b**2 - 4*c))/2,
    (-b - cmath.sqrt(b**2 - 4*c))/2
]

min_value = float('inf')
# Consider all permutations of the 4 roots
for perm in itertools.permutations(roots):
    z1, z2, z3, z4 = perm
    value = abs(z1*z2 + z3*z4)
    print(f"Permutation: {value:.6f}")
    if value < min_value:
        min_value = value

print(f"\nMinimum value: {min_value:.6f}")
```
