The problem asks for the smallest positive real number \( n \) such that \( n + \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor + \lfloor n^{1/3} \rfloor = 2014 \). To find this, we can iterate over possible integer values of \( \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor \) and \( \lfloor n^{1/3} \rfloor \), then solve for \( n \) and check the conditions.

Here's a Python program that enumerates possible values:

```python
import math

def find_min_n():
    target = 2014
    min_n = None
    
    # Iterate possible values for floor(n^(1/3)) = k
    for k in range(1, 100):
        # Iterate possible values for floor(sqrt(n)) = m
        for m in range(1, 1000):
            # Calculate n from the equation n + m + k = 2014
            n_candidate = target - m - k
            if n_candidate <= 0:
                continue
            
            # Check floor conditions
            if (math.floor(math.sqrt(n_candidate)) == m and 
                math.floor(n_candidate ** (1/3)) == k):
                # Check if this is the smallest n found so far
                if min_n is None or n_candidate < min_n:
                    min_n = n_candidate
                    print(f"Found candidate: n = {n_candidate}, floor(sqrt(n)) = {m}, floor(n^(1/3)) = {k}")
    
    if min_n is not None:
        print(f"\nMinimum n found: {min_n}")
    else:
        print("No solution found in the searched range")

find_min_n()
```

The program:
1. Iterates over possible integer values for both floor functions
2. For each combination, calculates the corresponding n value
3. Verifies that the floor conditions hold for this n
4. Keeps track of the smallest valid n found
5. Prints intermediate candidates and finally the smallest solution

The output will show all valid candidates found during the search, followed by the minimal solution. The ranges (1-100 for k and 1-1000 for m) were chosen to comfortably cover the expected solution space for the target value of 2014.
