This problem is asking to find the condition under which there exists a linear function y = m*x + b with m=-5 and b=-3. The solution is straightforward since we can substitute these values directly into the equation. The program will verify this by checking the equivalence for sample x and y values.

```python
def check_condition(x, y):
    # Check if y equals -5*x -3
    return y == -5 * x - 3

# Test with sample x values
sample_x = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
for x in sample_x:
    y = -5 * x - 3  # Compute y using the given m and b
    print(f"x={x}, y={y}, condition holds: {check_condition(x, y)}")
```
