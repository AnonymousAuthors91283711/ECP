[write_program]
This problem involves analyzing a series with terms involving divisor counts and alternating signs. We'll write a Python program to compute partial sums of this series to observe convergence behavior and potential patterns.

The program will:
1. Compute the A(k) function which counts odd divisors d of k where dÂ² < 2k
2. Calculate the series terms (-1)^(k-1)*A(k)/k
3. Compute partial sums up to a reasonable threshold (k=1000)
4. Print partial sums at intervals to observe convergence

```python
import math

def A(k):
    """Count odd divisors d of k where d^2 < 2k"""
    count = 0
    for d in range(1, int(math.isqrt(2*k)) + 1):
        if k % d == 0 and d % 2 == 1 and d*d < 2*k:
            count += 1
    return count

def compute_series(max_k=1000):
    """Compute partial sums of the series up to max_k"""
    partial_sum = 0.0
    for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
        term = ((-1)**(k-1)) * A(k) / k
        partial_sum += term
        if k % 100 == 0 or k <= 20:  # Print first 20 terms and then every 100
            print(f"k={k}: partial sum = {partial_sum:.15f}")
    print(f"\nFinal partial sum at k={max_k}: {partial_sum:.15f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_series()
```
