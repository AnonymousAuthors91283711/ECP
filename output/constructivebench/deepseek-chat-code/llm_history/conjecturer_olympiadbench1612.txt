Final answer for n=2017: 0
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<1>>> 

Explanation: The pattern shows a constant difference of -2 for n=1 to 5, but the problem asks for n=2017. Since 2^2017 has an odd number of digits in binary (2018 digits), the parity flips and the difference becomes 1. The answer generalizes to `if n = 0 then 1 else if n % 2 = 1 then 1 else -1`, but we only need the n=2017 case here.
