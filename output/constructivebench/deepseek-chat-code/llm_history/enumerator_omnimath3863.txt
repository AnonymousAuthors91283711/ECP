[write_program]
This problem involves finding the largest number of points that can be placed on an 8x8 chessboard such that for each point, the number of previous points attacking it along its row and column (with no blocking points in between) is odd. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible configurations and find the maximum number of points satisfying these conditions.

The approach will:
1. Represent positions as (row, column) pairs (0-7)
2. Generate all possible sequences of positions
3. For each sequence, check the odd attack condition for every point
4. Track the maximum valid sequence length found

```python
from itertools import permutations, combinations

def is_valid_sequence(seq):
    for k in range(1, len(seq)):
        x, y = seq[k]
        row_attackers = 0
        col_attackers = 0
        
        # Check row attackers
        last_row = -1
        for i in range(k-1, -1, -1):
            if seq[i][0] == x and (last_row == -1 or seq[i][1] != last_row):
                row_attackers += 1
                last_row = seq[i][1]
        
        # Check column attackers
        last_col = -1
        for i in range(k-1, -1, -1):
            if seq[i][1] == y and (last_col == -1 or seq[i][0] != last_col):
                col_attackers += 1
                last_col = seq[i][0]
        
        if (row_attackers + col_attackers) % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_max_points():
    max_points = 0
    board = [(r, c) for r in range(8) for c in range(8)]
    
    # Check sequences of increasing lengths
    for n in range(1, 65):
        found = False
        # Sample a subset of permutations for efficiency
        for sample in combinations(board, n):
            if is_valid_sequence(sample):
                print(f"Found valid sequence of length {n}: {sample}")
                max_points = n
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            break
    
    print(f"Maximum points found: {max_points}")

find_max_points()
```
