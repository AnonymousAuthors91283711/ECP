From the enumerated answers and the theorem statement, we can observe that:
1. The pattern matches the general form given in the theorem (1 - sin²(2ⁿ⁺¹x)/(4ⁿ⁺¹sin²x))
2. For n=2010 (since range 2011 gives k up to 2010), we should use n+1=2011 in the formula
3. The error in the proposed answer was just a missing closing parenthesis

The correct answer follows directly from the pattern shown in both the theorem statement and the enumerated results. For the specific case when n=2010, we simply substitute this into the general form.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<fun x : ℝ => 1 - (sin (2^2011 * x))^2 / (4^2011 * (sin x)^2)>>>
