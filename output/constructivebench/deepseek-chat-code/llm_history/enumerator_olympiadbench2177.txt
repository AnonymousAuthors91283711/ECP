[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer k such that there exists a coloring of natural numbers with k colors and a function f that is additive only when the inputs have the same color, but not additive in general. We'll write a Python program to search for the minimal k by testing small values.

The approach:
1. For each k starting from 1 upwards, we'll try to find a coloring and function satisfying the conditions
2. We'll use small natural numbers (up to some limit) to test the conditions
3. The program stops when it finds the smallest k that works

```python
def main():
    max_n = 5  # Test numbers up to this value
    for k in range(1, 6):  # Try k from 1 to 5
        print(f"Testing k = {k}")
        found = False
        
        # Try all possible colorings of {1..max_n} with k colors
        from itertools import product
        for coloring in product(range(k), repeat=max_n):
            # Try all possible function values for f(1)..f(max_n)
            for f_values in product(range(1, 4), repeat=max_n):
                f = lambda n: f_values[n-1] if n <= max_n else 0
                color = lambda n: coloring[n-1] if n <= max_n else 0
                
                # Check the additive condition for same-colored pairs
                same_color_ok = True
                for m in range(1, max_n+1):
                    for n in range(1, max_n+1):
                        if m + n > max_n:
                            continue
                        if color(m) == color(n) and f(m+n) != f(m) + f(n):
                            same_color_ok = False
                            break
                    if not same_color_ok:
                        break
                
                # Check there exists at least one pair where additivity fails
                exists_failure = False
                for m in range(1, max_n+1):
                    for n in range(1, max_n+1):
                        if m + n > max_n:
                            continue
                        if color(m) != color(n) and f(m+n) != f(m) + f(n):
                            exists_failure = True
                            break
                    if exists_failure:
                        break
                
                if same_color_ok and exists_failure:
                    print(f"Found solution for k = {k}")
                    print(f"Coloring: {[coloring[i] for i in range(max_n)]}")
                    print(f"Function values: {[f_values[i] for i in range(max_n)]}")
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if found:
            print(f"Minimal k found: {k}")
            return
