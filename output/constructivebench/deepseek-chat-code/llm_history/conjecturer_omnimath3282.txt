. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Looking at the pattern from the enumerated answers:
n=2 → 2
n=3 → 4
n=4 → 4
n=5 → 5
n=6 → 8

The maximum number of negative coefficients seems to follow n when n is odd, and 2*(n-1) when n is even. This suggests the answer alternates between these two cases.

<<<fun n => if Even n then 2 * (n - 1) else n>>>
