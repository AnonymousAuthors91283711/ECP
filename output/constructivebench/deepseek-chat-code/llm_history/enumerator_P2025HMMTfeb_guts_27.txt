[write_program]
This problem involves a recursive function f defined on natural numbers and asks for the sum of f(m)/(m*(m+1)) from m=1 to 31. The function f has base case f(0)=0 and recursive case f(m) = f(m/2) + (m/2 + 1)^2 for m>0.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Compute the recursive function f(m)
2. Calculate the sum for m from 1 to 31
3. Output each term and partial sums to observe patterns

```python
def compute_f(m):
    if m == 0:
        return 0
    half = m // 2
    return compute_f(half) + (half + 1) ** 2

def main():
    total = 0
    for m in range(1, 32):
        f_m = compute_f(m)
        term = f_m / (m * (m + 1))
        total += term
        print(f"m={m}: f(m)={f_m}, term={term:.6f}, partial_sum={total:.6f}")
    
    print("\nFinal sum:", total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program computes f(m) recursively according to the given definition, then calculates each term in the sum and accumulates the total. It prints each term and partial sum to help observe patterns. The final sum is printed at the end. The output shows the exact rational values through floating point approximation, but exact computation could be done with fractions if needed.
