[write_program]
This problem asks for the maximal constant C such that for every n â‰¥ 2, there exists n points in [-1,1] where the product of pairwise differences is at least C^(n(n-1)/2). The solution involves Chebyshev polynomials, where the extremal configuration is given by the roots of Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind. The optimal C is 1/2.

We'll write a Python program to verify this conjecture numerically for small values of n by:
1. Generating Chebyshev roots in [-1,1]
2. Calculating the product of pairwise differences
3. Comparing with (1/2)^(n(n-1)/2)

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def chebyshev_roots(n):
    """Return roots of Chebyshev polynomial of first kind T_n(x)"""
    return [math.cos((2*k-1)*math.pi/(2*n)) for k in range(1, n+1)]

def pairwise_product(xs):
    """Calculate product of (x_i - x_j) for all i < j"""
    prod = 1.0
    n = len(xs)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            prod *= abs(xs[i] - xs[j])
    return prod

def verify_conjecture(max_n=8):
    for n in range(2, max_n+1):
        roots = chebyshev_roots(n)
        actual = pairwise_product(roots)
        exponent = n * (n - 1) / 2
        conjectured = (0.5) ** exponent
        ratio = actual / conjectured
        print(f"n={n}: actual={actual:.6f}, conjectured={conjectured:.6f}, ratio={ratio:.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    verify_conjecture()
```
