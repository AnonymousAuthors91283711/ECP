This problem involves finding the 100th term of a strictly increasing sequence GEB where:
1. GEB(0) = 1
2. The differences between consecutive terms form another strictly increasing sequence
3. For any m > 0, m is not in GEB's range iff there exists exactly one n where diff(n) = m

This resembles how prime gaps work - non-prime numbers correspond to unique gap sizes. The sequence appears to be the sequence of prime numbers. Let's verify this conjecture by enumerating small values.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]:
        if n % p == 0:
            return n == p
    d = n - 1
    s = 0
    while d % 2 == 0:
        d //= 2
        s += 1
    for a in [2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504, 1795265022]:
        if a >= n:
            continue
        x = pow(a, d, n)
        if x == 1 or x == n - 1:
            continue
        for _ in range(s - 1):
            x = pow(x, 2, n)
            if x == n - 1:
                break
        else:
            return False
    return True

# Generate primes up to a threshold
primes = []
n = 2
while len(primes) < 101:  # We need GEB(100) which is the 101st prime (including GEB(0)=1)
    if is_prime(n):
        primes.append(n)
    n += 1

# The sequence starts with GEB(0)=1, then primes
GEB = [1] + primes[:100]

# Print the sequence up to n=10 for verification
print("First few terms:")
for i in range(11):
    print(f"GEB({i}) = {GEB[i]}")

# Print the answer for n=100
print(f"\nGEB(100) = {GEB[100]}")
```
