This problem appears to be about counting certain types of perfect matchings on a 2×8 grid graph where edges represent adjacent cells (including wrap-around if the problem allows). The conditions require that the matching is bijective and preserves adjacency.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate perfect matchings on a 2×8 grid (without wrap-around) to help conjecture the answer. We'll represent the grid positions as (row, col) pairs and implement backtracking to find valid matchings.

```python
def main():
    rows = 2
    cols = 8
    size = rows * cols
    
    # Generate all grid positions
    positions = [(r, c) for r in range(rows) for c in range(cols)]
    
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = {}
    for r, c in positions:
        neighbors = []
        if r > 0: neighbors.append((r-1, c))
        if r < rows-1: neighbors.append((r+1, c))
        if c > 0: neighbors.append((r, c-1))
        if c < cols-1: neighbors.append((r, c+1))
        adj[(r, c)] = neighbors
    
    count = 0
    
    def backtrack(matching, used):
        nonlocal count
        if len(matching) == size:
            count += 1
            print(f"Found matching #{count}")
            return
        
        # Find first unmatched position
        for pos in positions:
            if pos not in used:
                break
        
        # Try matching with each adjacent position
        for neighbor in adj[pos]:
            if neighbor not in used:
                new_matching = matching.copy()
                new_matching[pos] = neighbor
                new_matching[neighbor] = pos
                new_used = used.copy()
                new_used.update([pos, neighbor])
                backtrack(new_matching, new_used)
                break  # Only need one direction to avoid duplicates
    
    print(f"Counting perfect matchings on {rows}x{cols} grid...")
    backtrack({}, set())
    print(f"Total perfect matchings found: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note: This program will not complete in reasonable time for a 2×8 grid due to combinatorial explosion, but it demonstrates the approach. For the actual problem, mathematical analysis would be needed rather than brute-force enumeration. The program could be modified to count matchings on smaller grids first (like 2×2, 2×3) to look for patterns.
