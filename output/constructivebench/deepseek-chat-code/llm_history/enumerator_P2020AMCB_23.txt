[write_program]
This problem asks for the largest natural number n ≥ 2 such that for any n complex numbers on the unit circle summing to zero, they must be equally spaced (roots of unity). We'll write a program to test small values of n to find the maximal n satisfying this condition.

The approach:
1. For each n from 2 upwards, check if all zero-sum configurations of n unit complex numbers must be equally spaced
2. For small n, we can verify this by checking all possible angle configurations
3. We'll stop when we find the first n where this condition fails

```python
import math
import cmath
from itertools import combinations

def is_equally_spaced(angles, n, tolerance=1e-6):
    """Check if angles are equally spaced modulo 2π"""
    angles = sorted(angles)
    # Calculate differences between consecutive angles
    diffs = [(angles[(i+1)%n] - angles[i]) % (2*math.pi) for i in range(n)]
    # All differences should be equal (mod 2π/n)
    expected = 2*math.pi/n
    return all(abs(d - expected) < tolerance for d in diffs)

def check_n(n, num_samples=100):
    """Check if all zero-sum n-tuples of unit complex numbers are equally spaced"""
    # For n=2,3,4 we can prove mathematically they satisfy the condition
    if n <= 4:
        return True
    
    # For n>4, we look for counterexamples
    # Sample points on unit circle with angles that sum to zero
    for _ in range(num_samples):
        # Generate random angles (not all cases, but enough for testing)
        angles = [2*math.pi * i/n + 0.1*math.pi*(math.random() - 0.5) for i in range(n-1)]
        last_angle = -sum(cmath.exp(1j*a) for a in angles)
        last_angle = cmath.phase(last_angle)

            continue

            print(f"n = {n} satisfies the condition")
        else:
