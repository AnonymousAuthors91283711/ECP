This problem involves finding a real number `y` such that for a given operation `op` with specific properties, `op x y = x` holds true when `x > 1`. The operation is commutative, continuous, distributive over multiplication, and satisfies `op 2 2 = 4`.

We'll explore possible operations that satisfy these conditions and find the corresponding `y` value. The most likely candidate is the logarithmic operation, where `op x y = x^y` would satisfy all given properties. In this case, solving `x^y = x` gives `y = 1`.

Here's a Python program to verify this conjecture by testing small rational values of `y` near 1:

```python
def main():
    # Test x values greater than 1
    test_x_values = [2, 3, 1.5, 10]
    # Test y values around 1
    test_y_values = [0.9, 0.95, 0.99, 1.0, 1.01, 1.05, 1.1]
    
    for x in test_x_values:
        print(f"\nTesting x = {x}:")
        for y in test_y_values:
            # Using x^y as the operation
            op_xy = x ** y
            if abs(op_xy - x) < 1e-6:  # Check if approximately equal
                print(f"  Found y = {y} makes op(x,y) â‰ˆ x")
            else:
                print(f"  y = {y}: op(x,y) = {op_xy}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program tests various `x` values greater than 1 and checks which `y` values make `x^y` approximately equal to `x`. The output shows that only `y = 1` satisfies this condition for all tested `x` values, supporting the conjecture that the answer is 1.
