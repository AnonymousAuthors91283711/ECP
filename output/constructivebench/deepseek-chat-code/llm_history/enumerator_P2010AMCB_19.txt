This problem involves finding natural numbers a, r, q, d that satisfy several conditions:
1. The sum of a geometric series (a + aq + aq² + aq³) equals the sum of an arithmetic series (a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+3d)) plus 1
2. Both sums must be ≤ 100
3. The answer is defined as 2a + aq + (a+d)

We'll enumerate possible values of q (since q>1), then for each q find possible a and d that satisfy the equation.

```python
def solve():
    max_sum = 100
    for q in range(2, 5):  # q>1 and q^3 can't be too large for sums ≤100
        for a in range(1, max_sum):
            geo_sum = a * (1 + q + q**2 + q**3)
            if geo_sum > max_sum:
                continue
            # The arithmetic sum is geo_sum - 1
            arith_sum = geo_sum - 1
            # Arithmetic sum formula: 4a + 6d
            # So 4a + 6d = arith_sum
            # We need (arith_sum - 4a) divisible by 6 and d > 0
            numerator = arith_sum - 4*a
            if numerator <= 0:
                continue
            if numerator % 6 != 0:
                continue
            d = numerator // 6
            if d <= 0:
                continue
            # Check arithmetic sum ≤100
            if 4*a + 6*d > max_sum:
                continue
            answer = 2*a + a*q + (a + d)
            print(f"Found solution: a={a}, q={q}, d={d}, answer={answer}")
    
    print("Enumerated all possible solutions up to sum 100")

solve()
