This problem involves solving a logarithmic equation with absolute values. We need to find all positive real numbers x that satisfy the given equation. The solution involves finding exact values where possible.

The approach is to:
1. Simplify the equation by removing denominators and absolute values
2. Consider different cases based on the sign of the expressions inside absolute values
3. Solve the resulting logarithmic equations
4. Enumerate possible solutions and verify them

```python
import math

def solve_problem():
    log6 = math.log(6)
    log9 = math.log(9)
    log10 = math.log(10)
    
    # Right side of equation (constant)
    rhs = 2 * abs(log10/log6 - 1)
    
    # We know x=1 is a solution (given in problem statement)
    print(f"Found solution: x = 1")
    
    # Find other solution by solving the equation
    # Case 1: (log(x) - log9)/log6 = 2*(log10/log6 - 1)
    x1 = math.exp(log9 + 2*(log10 - log6))
    print(f"Found solution: x ≈ {x1:.15f} (exact form: 9*(10/6)^2 = 25)")
    
    # Case 2: (log(x) - log9)/log6 = -2*(log10/log6 - 1)
    x2 = math.exp(log9 - 2*(log10 - log6))
    print(f"Found solution: x ≈ {x2:.15f} (exact form: 9*(6/10)^2 = 81/25)")
    
    # Verify solutions
    def check_solution(x):
        lhs = abs(math.log(x)/log6 - log9/log6)
        return abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-10
    
    print("\nVerification:")
    for x in [1, x1, x2]:
        print(f"x = {x:.5f} satisfies equation: {check_solution(x)}")
