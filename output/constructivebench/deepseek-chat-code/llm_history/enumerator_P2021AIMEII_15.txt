[write_program]
This problem involves finding the smallest positive integer n where f(n)*7 = g(n)*4, with f and g defined by recurrence relations. We'll write a Python program to compute f(n) and g(n) values and check the condition.

The recurrence relations are:
- f(n) = 2*f(n-1) + g(n-1), with f(0)=1
- g(n) is not explicitly defined, but from the context it's likely g(n) = f(n-1) + k*g(n-1) for some k (we'll assume k=1 based on typical problem patterns)

We'll compute f(n) and g(n) iteratively and check the condition f(n)*7 == g(n)*4 for each n.

```python
def find_min_n():
    # Initialize f and g with given base cases
    f_prev, g_prev = 1, 0
    n = 1
    
    while True:
        # Compute next f and g values
        f_current = 2 * f_prev + g_prev
        g_current = f_prev + g_prev  # Assuming g(n) = f(n-1) + g(n-1)
        
        # Check the condition
        if f_current * 7 == g_current * 4:
            print(f"Found solution at n={n}: f({n})={f_current}, g({n})={g_current}")
            print(f"Verification: {f_current}*7 = {f_current*7}, {g_current}*4 = {g_current*4}")
            return n
        
        # Update for next iteration
        f_prev, g_prev = f_current, g_current
        n += 1

# Execute the search
find_min_n()
```
