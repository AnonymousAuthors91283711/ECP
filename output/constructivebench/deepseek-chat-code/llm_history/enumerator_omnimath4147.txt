[write_program]
This problem involves functional equations and rational numbers. The task is to determine for which rational numbers q there exists a function f satisfying f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + f(y) for all real x,y, and f(z) = q*z for some real z.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible q values and check conditions. Since the functional equation suggests f might be linear (f(x) = kx), we'll test rational q values and see if they satisfy the conditions.

```python
def check_linear_solution(q):
    """Check if f(x) = kx satisfies the functional equation and condition."""
    # For linear f(x) = kx, the functional equation becomes:
    # k(x + ky) = kx + ky => kÂ²y = ky for all y
    # This holds when k=0 or k=1
    # The condition f(z)=q*z becomes kz = qz, so either:
    # 1. k=q and z arbitrary (when q=0 or q=1), or
    # 2. z=0 (for any k)
    return q == 0 or q == 1

def main():
    # Test rational numbers with small denominators
    print("Checking possible q values:")
    for denom in range(1, 5):
        for numer in range(-5, 6):
            q = numer / denom
            if check_linear_solution(q):
                print(f"q = {q} satisfies the conditions")

    # After enumeration, we can conjecture the answer is {0,1}
    print("\nConjectured omnimath4147_answer: {0, 1}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
