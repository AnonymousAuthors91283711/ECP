open Set Function Nat

abbrev omnimath2568_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2568 : 
  Infinite omnimath2568_answer ∧ ∀ a ∈ omnimath2568_answer, ∀ b ∈ omnimath2568_answer, a < b → Squarefree (a + b) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: sorry  -- The actual construction is non-trivial
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | n % 8 = 1 ∨ n % 8 = 2 ∨ n % 8 = 5}
<<<False>>>
The proposed answer suggests numbers congruent to 1, 2, or 5 modulo 8. While this set is indeed infinite, it doesn't guarantee that the sum of any two elements will be squarefree. For example:
- Take a = 1 (≡1 mod8) and b = 2 (≡2 mod8), their sum is 3 (squarefree)
- But take a = 1 (≡1 mod8) and b = 8+1=9 (≡1 mod8), their sum is 10 (not squarefree since 10 is divisible by 2²)
Thus, the proposed answer fails to satisfy the second condition of the theorem.
