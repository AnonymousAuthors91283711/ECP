Ground Truth Answer: 47/300
Proposed Answer: 2 / 25
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about calculating the probability that in a random permutation of 25 people, Charlie is adjacent to either Chris or Abby in the ordering.

2. The ground truth answer is 47/300 ≈ 0.156666...

3. The proposed answer is 2/25 = 0.08

4. The correct probability should be calculated as follows:
   - For one specific person (either Chris or Abby), the probability Charlie is adjacent is 2/25 (since Charlie can be immediately before or after them in the permutation)
   - However, we need to consider both Chris and Abby, and subtract the overlap where Charlie is adjacent to both (which is very rare)
   - The exact calculation would be 2*(2/25) - (2/24*1/25) ≈ 0.156666..., which matches the ground truth

5. The proposed answer only considers one case (2/25) without accounting for both people and the overlap.
