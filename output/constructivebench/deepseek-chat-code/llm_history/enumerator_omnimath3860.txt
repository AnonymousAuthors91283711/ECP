This problem involves finding the minimal possible value of a[2019] in a sequence of 2020 positive integers where for i â‰¥ 2, a[i+1] is divisible by both a[i] and (a[i] + a[i-1]). We'll explore small cases to identify a pattern.

The approach:
1. Start with small sequences (n=3,4,5) to find patterns
2. Observe that Fibonacci-like sequences satisfy the conditions
3. Check minimal sequences where each term is as small as possible

```python
def find_min_sequence(n):
    # Try to find minimal sequence for small n values
    from itertools import product
    
    min_a = float('inf')
    
    # Try small initial values since we're looking for minimal sequences
    for a0 in range(1, 5):
        for a1 in range(1, 5):
            sequence = [a0, a1]
            valid = True
            
            for i in range(1, n-1):
                # Next term must be divisible by current term and sum with previous
                current = sequence[i]
                prev = sequence[i-1]
                # Find minimal next term satisfying conditions
                next_term = current
                while True:
                    if next_term % current == 0 and next_term % (current + prev) == 0:
                        break
                    next_term += current
                sequence.append(next_term)
                
                # Early termination if sequence exceeds current minimum
                if i == n-2 and next_term >= min_a:
                    valid = False
                    break
            
            if valid and sequence[-1] < min_a:
                min_a = sequence[-1]
                print(f"For n={n}, minimal sequence ending with: {min_a}")
                print(f"Full sequence: {sequence}")
    
    print(f"Minimal a[{n-1}] for n={n}: {min_a}")

# Test small cases to observe pattern
for n in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]:
    find_min_sequence(n)
```
