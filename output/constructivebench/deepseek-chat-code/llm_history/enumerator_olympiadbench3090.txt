[write_program]
This problem involves Fibonacci numbers and quadratic equations. We need to find a closed-form expression for (r+1)(s+1) where r and s are roots of a Fibonacci-related quadratic equation. The program will enumerate small k values and compute the expression to help identify the pattern.

```python
def fib(n):
    """Generate Fibonacci numbers efficiently"""
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a

def compute_expression(k):
    """Compute (r+1)(s+1) for given k using Vieta's formulas"""
    Fk = fib(k)
    Fk1 = fib(k+1)
    Fk2 = fib(k+2)
    
    # The quadratic equation is Fk*xÂ² + Fk1*x + Fk2 = 0
    # Using Vieta's formulas: r+s = -Fk1/Fk, r*s = Fk2/Fk
    # We need to compute (r+1)(s+1) = rs + r + s + 1
    return (Fk2/Fk) - (Fk1/Fk) + 1

# Enumerate for small k values to identify pattern
for k in range(1, 11):
    result = compute_expression(k)
    # Print exact fraction when possible
    if result == int(result):
        print(f"k={k}: {int(result)}")
    else:
        print(f"k={k}: {result}")
```
