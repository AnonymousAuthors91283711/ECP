This problem involves solving a system of equations to find the total cost for 8 adults and 6 children given pricing relationships. We'll write a Python program to verify the solution by:
1. Expressing child_price in terms of adult_price
2. Solving the initial equation for adult_price
3. Calculating the final cost

```python
def solve_problem():
    # Given child_price = adult_price / 2
    # Initial equation: 5*adult + 4*child = 24.50
    # We can substitute child_price:
    # 5*adult + 4*(adult/2) = 24.50 => 7*adult = 24.50
    adult_price = 24.50 / 7
    child_price = adult_price / 2
    
    # Calculate final cost: 8*adult + 6*child
    total_cost = 8 * adult_price + 6 * child_price
    
    # Print exact value (as fraction) and decimal approximation
    print(f"Adult price: {adult_price} (exact: {24.5/7})")
    print(f"Child price: {child_price} (exact: {24.5/14})")
    print(f"Total cost for 8 adults and 6 children: {total_cost} (exact: {24.5/7*8 + 24.5/14*6})")
