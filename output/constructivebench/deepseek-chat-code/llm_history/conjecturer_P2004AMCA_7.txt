Iteration 1: (-13, 15, 14)
Maximum iterations: 1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ × ℕ → ℕ
Based on the problem statement and the enumerated answer showing that the iteration stops immediately (after 1 step) when starting with (15,14,13), the pattern suggests the function always returns 1 regardless of input. The transformation immediately makes one coordinate negative, terminating the process.
