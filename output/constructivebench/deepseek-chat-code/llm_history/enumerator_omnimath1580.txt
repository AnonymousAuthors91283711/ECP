This problem involves finding the number of real fixed points for a recursive sequence after 2007 iterations. The sequence is defined by a cubic recurrence relation. We'll analyze the fixed points by solving x = x³ - 3x² + 3 and checking their stability under iteration.

The Python program will:
1. Find all real roots of the fixed point equation
2. Check how many remain fixed after repeated application of the recurrence
3. Count the stable fixed points (those that remain fixed under iteration)

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

def recurrence(x):
    return x**3 - 3*x**2 + 3

def find_fixed_points():
    # Find all real roots of x = x^3 - 3x^2 + 3
    def equation(x):
        return x**3 - 3*x**2 - x + 3
    
    # Initial guesses based on plot analysis
    roots = set()
    for guess in [-2, 0, 1.5, 3]:
        root = fsolve(equation, guess)[0]
        roots.add(round(root, 10))  # Round to handle numerical precision
    
    return sorted(roots)

def check_stability(x, iterations=2007):
    current = x
    for _ in range(iterations):
        current = recurrence(current)
        if abs(current - x) > 1e-6:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    fixed_points = find_fixed_points()
    print("Potential fixed points:", fixed_points)
    
    stable_points = []
    for x in fixed_points:
        if check_stability(x):
            stable_points.append(x)
    
    print("Stable fixed points after 2007 iterations:", stable_points)
    print("Number of stable fixed points:", len(stable_points))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
