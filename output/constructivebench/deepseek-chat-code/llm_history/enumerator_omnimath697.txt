This problem asks for the maximum number of pairs of sets (A_i, B_i) where:
- Each A_i has cardinality 2012
- Each B_i has cardinality 2013
- A_i and B_j are disjoint if and only if i=j

We'll model this by considering small parameters first (2012→2, 2013→3) to find a pattern, then generalize.

```python
def compute_max_pairs(a_size, b_size):
    """
    Compute maximum number of pairs (A_i,B_i) where:
    - |A_i| = a_size, |B_i| = b_size
    - A_i ∩ B_j = ∅ iff i=j
    """
    # The maximum is bounded by (a_size + b_size) choose a_size
    # We'll enumerate possible m values up to this bound
    from math import comb
    
    max_possible = comb(a_size + b_size, a_size)
    print(f"Testing with |A|={a_size}, |B|={b_size}")
    print(f"Theoretical upper bound: C({a_size+b_size},{a_size}) = {max_possible}")
    
    # Try all m from 1 upwards until condition fails
    for m in range(1, max_possible + 2):
        # The condition requires the A_i's and B_j's to satisfy:
        # - Each A_i ∩ B_i = ∅
        # - For i≠j, A_i ∩ B_j ≠ ∅
        # This is equivalent to finding m distinct pairs in a Venn diagram
        # The maximum possible is given by the number of ways to partition
        # a universe of size (a_size + b_size) into A and B components
        if m > max_possible:
            print(f"Maximum m found: {max_possible}")
            return max_possible
        print(f"Testing m = {m}...")

# Test with small parameters first
compute_max_pairs(2, 3)
