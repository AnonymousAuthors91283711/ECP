theorem IMO2023SLN7 (a b c d : ℕ) (ha : 0 < a) (hb : 0 < b) (hc : 0 < c) (hd : 0 < d) :
    a*b/(a+b) + c*d/(c+d) = (a+b)*(c+d)/(a+b+c+d) ↔ a+b+c+d ∈ IMO2023SLN7_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∃ p : ℕ, p.Prime ∧ p^2 ∣ n}
Proposed Answer: {s : ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, s = k^2}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding when the given equation holds for positive natural numbers a,b,c,d.

2. The ground truth answer states that the sum a+b+c+d must be a positive integer divisible by the square of a prime number.

3. The proposed answer suggests that the sum must be a perfect square.

Comparison:
- Not all perfect squares are divisible by the square of a prime (e.g., 1 is a perfect square but doesn't satisfy the condition).
- Not all numbers divisible by the square of a prime are perfect squares (e.g., 8 is divisible by 2² but isn't a perfect square).

The two conditions are different, though they overlap in cases where numbers are both perfect squares and divisible by prime squares (like 4, 9, 16, etc.).
