[write_program]
The problem asks to count the number of ordered triples (a, b, c) where a, b, c are distinct powers of 3 (from 3^1 to 3^8) that satisfy a ≤ b ≤ c and pairwise divisibility conditions (a*b)%c=0, (a*c)%b=0, (b*c)%a=0). We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such triples.

Key observations:
1. Since a, b, c are powers of 3, we can represent them as exponents (i, j, k)
2. The divisibility conditions simplify to checking max(i,j) ≥ k, max(i,k) ≥ j, max(j,k) ≥ i
3. We need to count unique ordered triples with i ≤ j ≤ k

```python
def main():
    # Generate powers of 3 from 3^1 to 3^8
    powers = [3**i for i in range(1, 9)]
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through all ordered triples a <= b <= c
    for a_idx in range(len(powers)):
        a = powers[a_idx]
        for b_idx in range(a_idx, len(powers)):
            b = powers[b_idx]
            for c_idx in range(b_idx, len(powers)):
                c = powers[c_idx]
                # Check the divisibility conditions
                if (a * b) % c == 0 and (a * c) % b == 0 and (b * c) % a == 0:
                    count += 1
                    print(f"Found triple: ({a}, {b}, {c})")
    
    print(f"Total number of valid triples: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
