The problem is to find the value of `(4*x)/360` given the equation `4*x + 20 + 140 = 360` with constraints `0 < x < 180`. First, we'll solve for x, then compute the expression.

```python
# Solve 4x + 20 + 140 = 360 for x
x = (360 - 20 - 140) / 4
# Compute (4x)/360
result = (4 * x) / 360
print(result)
```
