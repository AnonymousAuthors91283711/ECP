[write_program]
This problem is about finding the supremum of all positive real numbers d such that there exists a sequence (a_n) in (0,d) where:
1. The sequence is injective on any initial segment
2. For any n, the interval [0,d] is partitioned into n+1 subintervals by the points a_0,...,a_{n-1}
3. Each subinterval has length ≤ 1/n

We'll write a program to enumerate possible d values by testing small n values and looking for patterns.

```python
import fractions
from itertools import combinations

def enumerate_d_values(max_n=5):
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        print(f"\nTesting n = {n}:")
        # We need to place n points in (0,d) creating n+1 intervals ≤1/n
        # The minimal d occurs when all intervals are exactly 1/n
        minimal_d = fractions.Fraction(n + 1, n)
        print(f"Minimal possible d for n={n}: {float(minimal_d)} (exact: {minimal_d})")
        
        # Check if this configuration works for injectivity
        # For n points, we need all a_i distinct and ordered
        # The minimal configuration satisfies this since a_i = (i+1)/n
        print(f"Configuration works: a_i = (i+1)/n")
        
        # Check if we can do better (smaller d)
        # For n=1: must have [0,a0] and [a0,d] both ≤1 ⇒ d ≤1
        # But since a0 ∈ (0,d), minimal d is 1
        if n == 1:
            print("Optimal d for n=1 is exactly 1")
        
        # For n=2: minimal d is 1.5 (3/2)
        # Any smaller d would make one interval >0.5
        if n == 2:
            print("Optimal d for n=2 is exactly 1.5")
