[write_program]
This problem involves finding the minimal sum of min(f(i), 2i+1) over all permutations f of [0..n-1]. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible sums for small values of n to help conjecture the pattern.

The approach:
1. For each n from 1 to a reasonable limit (we'll use 8)
2. Generate all permutations of [0..n-1]
3. For each permutation, compute the sum of min(f(i), 2i+1)
4. Track the minimal sum found
5. Output results for each n

```python
from itertools import permutations

def compute_min_sum(n):
    elements = list(range(n))
    min_sum = float('inf')
    
    for perm in permutations(elements):
        current_sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += min(perm[i], 2*i + 1)
        if current_sum < min_sum:
            min_sum = current_sum
            # Print immediately when new minimum found
            print(f"n={n}: new min sum {min_sum} with permutation {perm}")
    
    return min_sum

def main():
    max_n = 8  # Reasonable limit for exhaustive search
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        print(f"\nProcessing n = {n}")
        min_sum = compute_min_sum(n)
        print(f"Final minimal sum for n={n}: {min_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
