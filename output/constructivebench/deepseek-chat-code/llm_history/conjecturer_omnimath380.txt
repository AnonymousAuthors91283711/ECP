theorem omnimath380 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∃ (coloring : ℕ → ℕ), 
    ∀ (r₁ r₂ : ℕ), Adjacent r₁ r₂ → coloring r₁ ≠ coloring r₂} omnimath380_answer.1 ∧

    ∀ (r₁ r₂ : ℕ), CornerAdjacent r₁ r₂ → coloring r₁ ≠ coloring r₂} omnimath380_answer.2 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Standard adjacency (edge-connected):
1x1 grid: 2 colors sufficient
2x2 grid: 2 colors sufficient
3x3 grid: 2 colors sufficient
