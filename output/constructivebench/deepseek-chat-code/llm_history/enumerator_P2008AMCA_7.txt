This problem is about finding the least real number r ≥ 0 such that (10 - r) * (1/4 * 60) ≤ 30. Let's break it down:

1. First simplify the expression: (1/4 * 60) = 15
2. The inequality becomes: (10 - r) * 15 ≤ 30
3. Which simplifies to: 10 - r ≤ 2 → r ≥ 8

The minimal r satisfying this is 8. Here's a Python program that verifies this by testing values around the expected solution:

```python
def solve():
    # Test values around the expected solution
    for r in [7.9, 8.0, 8.1]:
        condition = (10 - r) * 15 <= 30
        print(f"r = {r}: condition {'holds' if condition else 'fails'}")
    
    # The minimal r is clearly 8
    print("\nThe least r satisfying the condition is:", 8.0)

solve()
```
