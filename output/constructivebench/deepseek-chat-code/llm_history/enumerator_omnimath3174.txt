[write_program]
This problem asks to find the smallest natural number `x` such that there do not exist natural numbers `a` and `b` with `0 < a < b` where `(b! - a!) % 10 = x`. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of `x` and check for each whether such `a` and `b` exist.

The approach is:
1. Compute factorials modulo 10 (since we only care about last digit)
2. Precompute factorial last digits up to a reasonable limit (since n! mod 10 becomes 0 for n â‰¥ 5)
3. Check all possible differences of factorials for a < b
4. Find which digits 0-9 cannot be expressed as such differences

```python
def main():
    # Precompute factorials mod 10
    max_n = 20  # Since 5! mod 10 is 0, higher factorials don't change last digit
    fact_mod = [1] * (max_n + 1)
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        fact_mod[n] = (fact_mod[n-1] * n) % 10
    
    # Check all possible a < b pairs
    possible_diffs = set()
    for b in range(1, max_n + 1):
        for a in range(1, b):
            diff = (fact_mod[b] - fact_mod[a]) % 10
            possible_diffs.add(diff)
    
    # Find which digits 0-9 are missing
    all_digits = set(range(10))
    missing = sorted(all_digits - possible_diffs)
    
    print("Possible differences modulo 10:", sorted(possible_diffs))
    print("Missing digits:", missing)
    if missing:
        print("Smallest missing digit:", min(missing))
    else:
        print("All digits 0-9 can be expressed as b!-a! mod 10")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
