This problem involves calculating the probability that in 6 games, a team wins more games than it loses, with each game having three possible outcomes (win, loss, tie) and specific probabilities. We'll enumerate all possible outcomes where wins > losses and sum their probabilities.

```python
from math import factorial
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    outcomes = 6
    p = Fraction(1, 3)  # Probability for each outcome
    total_prob = Fraction(0, 1)
    
    # Enumerate all possible combinations of wins, losses, ties
    for w in range(outcomes + 1):
        for l in range(outcomes + 1):
            t = outcomes - w - l
            if t >= 0 and w > l:
                # Calculate multinomial coefficient: 6!/(w! l! t!)
                coeff = factorial(outcomes) // (factorial(w) * factorial(l) * factorial(t))
                # Probability of this specific outcome
                prob = coeff * (p ** w) * (p ** l) * (p ** t)
                total_prob += prob
                print(f"w={w}, l={l}, t={t}: {prob}")
    
    print("\nFinal probability:", total_prob)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
