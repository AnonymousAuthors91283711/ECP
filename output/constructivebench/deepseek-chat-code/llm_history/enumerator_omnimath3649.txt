This problem involves finding the range of the function F = (y - x)/(x + 4y) under the constraint x²y² + xy + 1 = 3y². We'll approach this by:

1. Solving the constraint equation for x in terms of y
2. Substituting into F to get a function of y alone
3. Analyzing the behavior of this function to find its range

The Python program will:
1. Sample y values around the interesting regions
2. For each y, solve the quadratic for x
3. Compute F for valid (x,y) pairs
4. Track the minimum and maximum observed F values

```python
import math

def find_range():
    min_F = float('inf')
    max_F = -float('inf')
    
    # Sample y values around critical points
    for y in [i/1000 for i in range(-3000, 3001) if i != 0]:
        # Solve the constraint equation: x²y² + xy + 1 = 3y²
        # Rewrite as quadratic in x: y²x² + yx + (1-3y²) = 0
        a = y*y
        b = y
        c = 1 - 3*y*y
        
        discriminant = b*b - 4*a*c
        if discriminant < 0:
            continue  # No real solutions
        
        sqrt_disc = math.sqrt(discriminant)
        for sign in [-1, 1]:
            x = (-b + sign*sqrt_disc)/(2*a)
            denominator = x + 4*y
            if abs(denominator) < 1e-10:  # Avoid division by zero
                continue
            F = (y - x)/denominator
            min_F = min(min_F, F)
            max_F = max(max_F, F)
            print(f"y={y:.3f}, x={x:.3f}, F={F:.6f}")
    
    print(f"\nObserved minimum F: {min_F:.6f}")
    print(f"Observed maximum F: {max_F:.6f}")

find_range()
