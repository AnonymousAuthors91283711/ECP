[write_program]
This problem asks for the minimal possible value of `a₁ + a₂` where `a` is a sequence of natural numbers satisfying the recurrence relation `aₙ₊₂ = (aₙ + 2009)/(1 + aₙ₊₁)` for all `n ≥ 1`. We'll write a Python program to search for minimal `s = a₁ + a₂` values that allow such a sequence to exist.

The approach:
1. Iterate through possible values of `s` starting from the smallest possible (2)
2. For each `s`, try all possible `a₁` values from 1 to `s-1` (since `a₂ = s - a₁`)
3. Check if the sequence can be extended while remaining natural numbers
4. Stop at the first valid `s` found (which will be minimal)

```python
def find_min_s():
    max_terms = 10  # Check sequence up to this length
    for s in range(2, 1000):  # Arbitrary upper bound
        for a1 in range(1, s):
            a2 = s - a1
            sequence = [a1, a2]
            valid = True
            for n in range(1, max_terms - 1):
                try:
                    next_term = (sequence[n-1] + 2009) // (1 + sequence[n])
                    if next_term <= 0:
                        valid = False
                        break
                    sequence.append(next_term)
                except ZeroDivisionError:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                print(f"Found valid s = {s} with initial terms {a1}, {a2}")
                print(f"Sequence continues as: {sequence[2:5]}...")  # Show sample terms
                return s
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    min_s = find_min_s()
    print(f"Minimal s found: {min_s}")
```
