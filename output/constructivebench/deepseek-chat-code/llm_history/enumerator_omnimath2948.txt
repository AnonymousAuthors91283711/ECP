This problem is a simple linear equation where we need to solve for x and then compute x + 4. The equation given is 2x + 6 = 16. We'll solve it step by step and output the final answer.

```python
# Solving the equation 2x + 6 = 16
# Subtract 6 from both sides: 2x = 10
# Divide both sides by 2: x = 5
# Then x + 4 = 9

print(9)
