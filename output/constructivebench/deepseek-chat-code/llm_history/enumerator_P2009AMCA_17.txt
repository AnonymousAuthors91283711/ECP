This problem involves finding the sum of two distinct roots r₁ and r₂ that satisfy certain equations involving a geometric series. The equations suggest that r₁ and r₂ are roots of a quadratic equation derived from the given conditions. We'll write a Python program to explore possible values and find the sum r₁ + r₂.

The approach:
1. From the given equations, derive the quadratic equation r² - r + a = 0
2. The sum of roots (r₁ + r₂) should be 1 by Vieta's formulas
3. We'll verify this by testing small positive values of a and finding the roots

```python
import math

def find_sum_for_a(a):
    # Solve r² - r + a = 0
    discriminant = 1 - 4*a
    if discriminant <= 0:
        return None  # No real roots or repeated roots
    
    sqrt_discriminant = math.sqrt(discriminant)
    r1 = (1 + sqrt_discriminant) / 2
    r2 = (1 - sqrt_discriminant) / 2
    
    # Check conditions: 0 < r1, r2 and r1 ≠ r2
    if r1 > 0 and r2 > 0 and r1 != r2:
        # Verify the original equations
        if abs(a/(1 - r1) - r1) < 1e-9 and abs(a/(1 - r2) - r2) < 1e-9:
            return r1 + r2
    return None

# Test small positive values of a
for a in [0.1, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.4]:
    result = find_sum_for_a(a)
    if result is not None:
        print(f"For a = {a}, r1 + r2 = {result}")

# The pattern suggests r1 + r2 is always 1
print("Conjectured answer: r1 + r2 = 1")
```
