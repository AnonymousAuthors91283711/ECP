This problem involves finding the largest prime factor of the number of divisors of \(20^{21} \times 23^{21}\). To solve it computationally, we'll:

1. Factorize 20 and 23 to get their prime factors
2. Compute the exponents in the combined factorization
3. Calculate the number of divisors formula
4. Find the largest prime factor of this divisor count

Here's the Python program to enumerate the prime factors of K and find the largest one:

```python
import math

def prime_factors(n):
    factors = set()
    # Handle 2 separately
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.add(2)
        n = n // 2
    # Check odd divisors up to sqrt(n)
    i = 3
    max_factor = math.sqrt(n) + 1
    while i <= max_factor:
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.add(i)
            n = n // i
            max_factor = math.sqrt(n) + 1
        i += 2
    if n > 1:
        factors.add(n)
    return sorted(factors)

def main():
    T = 21
    # Prime factorizations: 20 = 2^2 * 5, 23 is prime
    # Exponents in 20^T * 23^T: 2^(2T) * 5^T * 23^T
    # Number of divisors formula: (2T+1)(T+1)(T+1)
    K = (2*T + 1) * (T + 1) * (T + 1)
    
    print(f"K = {K}")
    primes = prime_factors(K)
    print("Prime factors found:", primes)
    if primes:
        print("Largest prime factor:", max(primes))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program first calculates K using the divisor count formula, then finds all prime factors of K, and finally outputs the largest one. The output will show the intermediate values and the final result.
