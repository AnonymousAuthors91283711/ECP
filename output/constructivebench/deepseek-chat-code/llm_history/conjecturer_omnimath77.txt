abbrev omnimath77_answer : Set (ℕ → ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath77 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ (m n : ℕ), 0 < m → 0 < n → m ≥ n → f (m * φ (n^3)) = f m * φ (n^3)) ↔ f ∈ omnimath77_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Constant function f(n) = 0 works
Power function f(n) = n^1 works
Function Identity works
Function Zero works. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ → ℕ)
<<<{f | ∃ k : ℕ, f = fun n => n^k} ∪ {fun _ => 0}>>>
