This problem involves solving a system of functional equations to find the value of 2*f(2)*g(2). We'll solve the system algebraically for f(x) and g(x), then evaluate at x=2.

The system is:
1. f(x) + g(x) = 3x + 5
2. f(x) - g(x) = 5x + 7

Adding these equations gives 2f(x) = 8x + 12 ⇒ f(x) = 4x + 6
Subtracting gives 2g(x) = -2x - 2 ⇒ g(x) = -x - 1

Now we can compute f(2) = 4*2 + 6 = 14 and g(2) = -2 - 1 = -3
Finally, 2*f(2)*g(2) = 2*14*(-3) = -84

Here's the Python program that verifies this calculation:

```python
def f(x):
    return 4*x + 6

def g(x):
    return -x - 1

def calculate_answer():
    x = 2
    result = 2 * f(x) * g(x)
    print(f"2*f({x})*g({x}) = {result}")

calculate_answer()
```
