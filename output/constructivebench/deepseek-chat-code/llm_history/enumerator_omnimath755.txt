This problem involves finding possible values of b*c given three equations with real numbers a, b, c. We'll enumerate possible values by solving the system of equations numerically within a reasonable range.

The approach:
1. Use the given equations to express variables in terms of others
2. Iterate through possible values for one variable
3. Solve the remaining equations numerically
4. Check if solutions satisfy all constraints
5. Collect valid b*c products

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

def equations(vars, a_val):
    b, c = vars
    eq1 = a_val + b + c - 100
    eq2 = a_val*b + b*c + c*a_val - 20
    eq3 = (a_val + b)*(a_val + c) - 24
    return [eq1, eq2, eq3]

# Search range for 'a' values
a_values = np.linspace(-100, 100, 10000)
results = set()

for a in a_values:
    try:
        solution = fsolve(equations, [50, 50], args=(a,))
        b, c = solution
        # Check if solution is valid (close to zero for all equations)
        residuals = equations(solution, a)
        if all(abs(res) < 1e-6 for res in residuals):
            bc = b * c
            if -1e6 < bc < 1e6:  # Filter extreme values
                results.add(round(bc, 6))
    except:
        continue

# Print all found b*c values
for val in sorted(results):
    print(val)
```

Let me analyze the problem and the program:

1. Problem Analysis:
- We need to find real numbers a, b, c that satisfy three equations:
  a + b + c = 100
  ab + bc + ca = 20
  (a+b)(a+c) = 24
- The goal is to find all possible values of b*c

2. Program Issues:
- The current program tries to solve numerically but fails to find any solutions
- The approach of scanning a_values linearly is inefficient and misses solutions
- The initial guess [50,50] is too far from likely solutions
- The error tolerance might be too strict

3. Mathematical Insight:
From the equations, we can derive:
(a+b)(a+c) = a² + a(b+c) + bc = 24
But from h₁: b+c = 100-a
So: a² + a(100-a) + bc = 24 → 100a + bc = 24
From h₂: ab + bc + ca = bc + a(b+c) = bc + a(100-a) = 20
So we have two equations:
1) bc = 24 - 100a
2) bc = 20 - 100a + a²
Setting equal: 24-100a = 20-100a+a² → 4 = a² → a = ±2

This gives exact solutions we can compute directly.

Judgement: <<<False>>>

Here's the corrected program that uses the exact solution:

```python
# Exact solution derived from the equations
# From (a+b)(a+c) = 24 and a+b+c=100, we get bc = 24 - 100a
# From ab+bc+ca=20, we get bc = 20 - 100a + a²
# Setting equal gives a²=4 → a=±2

def compute_bc(a):
    # Using a+b+c=100 and bc=24-100a
    # b and c are roots of x² - (100-a)x + (24-100a) = 0
    discriminant = (100 - a)**2 - 4*(24 - 100*a)
    if discriminant < 0:
        return None
    sqrt_disc = discriminant**0.5
    b = ((100 - a) + sqrt_disc

Explanation:
The problem involves finding real numbers b*c that satisfy three given equations with variables a, b, c. Since no program was provided to enumerate possible solutions, we need to create one from scratch. The problem requires solving a system of nonlinear equations, which can be approached numerically or symbolically. For practical enumeration, we'll use numerical methods with small parameter variations.

The original submission is empty (None), so it must be rejected. We'll provide a corrected version that:
1. Uses small parameter variations for a
2. Solves for b and c given each a
3. Checks if all three equations are satisfied
4. Prints valid b*c values when found

The program will use floating-point arithmetic with a tolerance for equation satisfaction checks.

        # From h1: b+c = 100 - a
        # From h2: a(b+c) + bc = 20 => bc = 20 - a(100 - a)
        bc = 20 - a * (100 - a)

        c2 = (b_plus_c + sqrt_discriminant) / 2
        
        # Check all three equations for both solutions
        for b, c in [(b1, c1), (b2, c2)]:

            eq2 = abs
