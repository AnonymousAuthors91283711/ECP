[write_program]
This problem is from the 2013 AIME II competition (Problem 15). It asks for angles A, B, C of a triangle (summing to π) with positive cosines, where one cosine has a specific radical form (p + q√r)/s with conditions on p, q, r, s (coprime numerator/denominator, squarefree r, r not a perfect square). The final answer is the sum p+q+r+s.

We'll write a program to search for valid (p,q,r,s) combinations that satisfy all conditions, focusing on small integer values since the competition expects a reasonable answer.

```python
import math
from fractions import gcd
from math import isqrt

def is_squarefree(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, isqrt(n) + 1):
        if n % (i*i) == 0:
            return False
    return True

def is_coprime(a, b):
    return gcd(a, b) == 1

max_s = 30  # Reasonable upper bound for competition problem

for s in range(1, max_s + 1):
    for r in range(1, 100):
        if not is_squarefree(r) or isqrt(r)**2 == r:
            continue
        max_q = int((s - 1) / math.sqrt(r)) + 2
        for q in range(1, max_q + 1):
            max_p = s - q * math.sqrt(r)
            for p in range(1, int(max_p) + 2):
                if p + q * math.sqrt(r) >= s:
                    continue
                if not is_coprime(p + q * r, s):  # Simplified coprime check
                    continue
                cosA = (p + q * math.sqrt(r)) / s
                if not 0 < cosA < 1:
                    continue
                A = math.acos(cosA)
                # Now find B,C such that A+B+C=pi and all angles positive
                # We'll try B=A for simplicity (isosceles case)
                B = A
                C = math.pi - 2*A
                if C > 0:
                    print(f"Found: p={p}, q={q}, r={r}, s={s}, sum={p+q+r+s}")
                    print(f"Angles: A={math.degrees(A):.2f}°, B={math.degrees(B):.2f}°, C={math.degrees(C):.2f}°")
                    print(f"cosA = ({p} + {q}√{r})/{s}")
                    print("-----")

### Explanation of Judgement

The original program attempts to solve a problem involving finding real numbers A, B, C and integers p, q, r, s that satisfy several conditions, including trigonometric relationships and number-theoretic properties. However, there are several issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Coprime Check**: The program checks `is_coprime(p + q * r, s)` but the problem requires `IsCoprime (p + q) s`. This is a significant deviation from the problem statement.

2. **Squarefree Check**: While the squarefree check is implemented correctly, the program also needs to ensure that r is not a perfect square (`∀ k : ℕ, r ≠ k^2`), which is correctly checked.

3. **Angle Constraints**: The program assumes an isosceles triangle (B = A) to simplify the search, but this might miss valid solutions where all three angles are distinct.

4. **Empty Output**: The program produces no output, suggesting either the search space is too restricted or the conditions are too stringent.

5. **Parameter Selection**: The bounds for s (30) and r (100) might be too small to find valid solutions.

### Verdict

<<<False>>>

    if n == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, isqrt(n) + 1):
        if n % (i*i) == 0:
            return False

    return gcd(a, b) == 1

max_s = 100  # Increased upper bound
min_cos = -1  # Allowing negative cosine values for generality
max_cos = 1

    for r in range(1, 200):
        if not is_squarefree(r) or isqrt(r)**2 == r:
            continue
        max_q = int((s * max_cos) / math.sqrt(r)) + 2
        for q in range(0, max_q + 1):
            max_p = s * max_cos - q * math.sqrt(r)
            min_p = s * min_cos - q * math.sqrt(r)

Judgement:
The problem is a mathematical theorem statement from Lean (a proof assistant) about finding real numbers A, B, C and natural numbers p, q, r, s satisfying certain conditions, including trigonometric relationships and number-theoretic properties. The "program" section is empty, and there are no enumerated answers. This is clearly insufficient as it doesn't provide any computational approach to the problem.

Since the problem involves finding specific numerical values satisfying complex mathematical conditions, a Python program should be written to search for valid combinations of p, q, r, s that satisfy all constraints, particularly focusing on the cosine equation and the coprimality/squarerfree conditions.

The program should:
1. Search for small integer values of p, q, r, s
2. Verify the conditions (coprimes, squarefree, etc.)
3. Compute the corresponding angles A, B, C
4. Check if they sum to π
5. Output valid combinations

<<<False>>>

Here's a corrected program that implements this search:

```python
import math
from fractions import gcd
from itertools import count

def is_squarefree(n):
    if n % 4 == 0:
        return False
    max_test = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
    for i in range(2, max_test):
        if n % (i*i) == 0:
            return False
    return True

def is_coprime(a, b):
    return gcd(a, b) == 1

max_s = 100  # reasonable search limit
found = False

for s in range(1, max_s + 1):
    for r in range(1, s):
        if not is_squarefree(r):
            continue
        if int(math.sqrt(r))**2 == r:
            continue
        sqrt_r = math.sqrt(r)
        for q in range(1, s):
            for p in range(1, s):
                numerator = p + q * sqrt_r
                if numerator <= 0:
                    continue
                cosA = numerator / s
                if -1 <= cosA <= 1:
                    A = math.acos(cosA)
                    remaining = math.pi - A
                    # Try to find B and C that sum to remaining
                    # This part is complex and would need more constraints
                    # For now just print potential (p,q,r,s)
