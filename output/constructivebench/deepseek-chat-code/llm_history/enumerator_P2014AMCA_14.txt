[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest natural number c such that there exist natural numbers a < b < c satisfying both:
1. b - a = c - b (arithmetic progression condition)
2. c * a = b * b (geometric progression condition)

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of c and find the minimal solution. The arithmetic condition implies b = (a + c)/2, so c must have the same parity as a.

```python
def find_min_c(max_c=1000):
    for c in range(1, max_c + 1):
        for a in range(1, c):
            if (a + c) % 2 != 0:
                continue  # b must be integer
            b = (a + c) // 2
            if b <= a or b >= c:
                continue
            if c * a == b * b:
                print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
                return c  # Return first (smallest) solution found
    print(f"No solution found up to c={max_c}")
    return None

# Execute with reasonable upper bound
min_c = find_min_c()
if min_c is not None:
    print(f"Minimal c found: {min_c}")
```
