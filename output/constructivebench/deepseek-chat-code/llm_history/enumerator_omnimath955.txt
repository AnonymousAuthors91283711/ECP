This problem asks for the number of bijective functions from Fin 10 to Fin 10 where each element's image differs from its index by at most 1. This is equivalent to counting permutations where no element moves more than 1 position from its original location.

We'll enumerate all possible permutations of [0..9] where each element is either:
1. In its original position (i)
2. Swapped with its left neighbor (i-1)
3. Swapped with its right neighbor (i+1)

We'll use a recursive approach to count valid permutations, ensuring bijectivity by tracking used elements.

```python
def count_restricted_permutations(n):
    # Memoization decorator would help for larger n, but n=10 is manageable
    def backtrack(position, used):
        if position == n:
            return 1
        count = 0
        # Option 1: Keep element in original position
        if not used[position]:
            new_used = used.copy()
            new_used[position] = True
            count += backtrack(position + 1, new_used)
        # Option 2: Swap with next element if possible
        if position + 1 < n and not used[position + 1] and not used[position]:
            new_used = used.copy()
            new_used[position] = True
            new_used[position + 1] = True
            count += backtrack(position + 2, new_used)
        return count
    
    return backtrack(0, [False] * n)

# Print the count for n=10
print(count_restricted_permutations(10))
```
