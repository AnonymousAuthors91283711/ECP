. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
From the enumerated answers, we can observe a pattern where the valid n values for a given k follow the form m*(k+1) or m*(k+1)+1 for positive integers m. This suggests the answer involves multiples of (k+1) and numbers one greater than those multiples. The simplest closed form that captures this is:

<<<fun k => 2 * k + 1>>>

However, looking more carefully at the patterns:
- For k=2: n=2*1+1, 2*2+1, 2*3+1, etc. (odd numbers)
- For k=3: n=3+1, 3+2, 2*3+2, 2*3+3, etc.
- For k=4: n=4+1, 4+2, 2*4+2, 2*4+3, etc.

The most consistent pattern is n = m*(k+1) + r where r ∈ {0,1}, but the simplest closed form that matches all cases is n = 2k + 1, though this doesn't cover all enumerated cases. A better generalization would be:

<<<fun k => k + 1 + (k % 2)>>>

But this still doesn't match all cases. Given the complexity, the most likely intended answer based on the first pattern is:

<<<fun k => 2 * k + 1>>>
