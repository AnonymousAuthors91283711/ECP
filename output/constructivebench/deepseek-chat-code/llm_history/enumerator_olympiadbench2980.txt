The problem asks for the least upper bound (supremum) of the set of all sums a + b where a and b are positive real numbers satisfying two floor function conditions. We'll enumerate possible integer values for the floor expressions and check valid ranges for a and b.

```python
import math

def enumerate_solutions():
    max_sum = 0
    # The floor value k can range based on possible a and b values
    for k in range(0, 20):  # 20 is a safe upper bound since a > 0
        # Conditions from floor functions:
        # k ≤ 20 - a < k+1 → 20 - (k+1) < a ≤ 20 - k
        # k ≤ 19 - b < k+1 → 19 - (k+1) < b ≤ 19 - k
        # k ≤ a*b < k+1
        
        a_min = 20 - (k + 1)
        a_max = 20 - k
        b_min = 19 - (k + 1)
        b_max = 19 - k
        
        # We need to find a in (a_min, a_max] and b in (b_min, b_max]
        # such that k ≤ a*b < k+1
        
        # To maximize a + b, we should take a as large as possible (near a_max)
        # and find corresponding b that satisfies the product condition
        
        # Try a at upper bound
        a = a_max
        # Then b must satisfy k/a ≤ b < (k+1)/a
        # And also b must be in (b_min, b_max]
        b_lower = max(k / a, b_min)
        b_upper = min((k + 1) / a, b_max)
        
        if b_lower < b_upper:
            # Take b as large as possible to maximize sum
            b = min(b_upper, b_max)
            current_sum = a + b
            print(f"k={k}, a={a:.6f}, b={b:.6f}, sum={current_sum:.6f}")
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
        
        # Also check if better sum exists with b at upper bound
        b = b_max
        a_lower = max(k / b, a_min)
        a_upper = min((k + 1) / b, a_max)
        
        if a_lower < a_upper:
            a = min(a_upper, a_max)
            current_sum = a + b
            print(f"k={k}, a={a:.6f}, b={b:.6f}, sum={current_sum:.6f}")
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
    
    print(f"\nMaximum sum found: {max_sum:.6f}")

enumerate_solutions()
