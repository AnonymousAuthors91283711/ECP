[write_program]
This problem asks to determine for which natural numbers n > 0, there exists a k such that for all m â‰¥ k, the base-10 representation of n*5^m contains the digit '5'. We'll write a Python program to test small values of n and observe patterns.

The approach:
1. For each n from 1 to some threshold (say 100)
2. For each n, find the smallest m where 5 appears in n*5^m
3. Check if once 5 appears, it continues to appear for all larger m
4. Output the n values that satisfy this property

```python
def contains_five(num):
    return '5' in str(num)

def test_n(n, max_m=20):
    """Test if for n, there exists k such that for all m>=k, n*5^m contains 5"""
    found_k = None
    for m in range(max_m):
        val = n * (5 ** m)
        if contains_five(val):
            if found_k is None:
                found_k = m
        else:
            if found_k is not None:  # Failed - 5 disappeared
                return False
    return found_k is not None  # True if 5 appeared and stayed

def main():
    threshold = 100
    for n in range(1, threshold + 1):
        if test_n(n):
            print(f"n = {n} satisfies the condition")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
