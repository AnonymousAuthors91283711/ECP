This problem defines a recurrence relation with initial conditions x₁=1, x₂=2 and the recurrence xₙ₊₂ = 2xₙ₊₁ - xₙ + 2ⁿ. We need to compute x₂₀₁₂. The solution involves finding a closed-form formula for xₙ.

The recurrence is non-homogeneous due to the 2ⁿ term. We'll first solve the homogeneous part (xₙ₊₂ = 2xₙ₊₁ - xₙ), then find a particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation.

The program will compute the sequence values up to a reasonable limit to help identify the pattern and verify the closed-form solution.

```python
def compute_sequence(n_max):
    x = [0] * (n_max + 1)
    x[1] = 1
    x[2] = 2
    for n in range(1, n_max - 1):
        x[n+2] = 2 * x[n+1] - x[n] + (1 << n)
    return x

def print_sequence(n_max=20):
    x = compute_sequence(n_max)
    for n in range(1, n_max+1):
        print(f"x_{n} = {x[n]}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_sequence()
```
