abbrev omnimath2864_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2864
(length : ℝ)
(hiked : ℝ)
(hiked_def : hiked = 0.6 * length)
(hiked_left : length - hiked = 8)
: length = omnimath2864_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found possible length: 20.0
The exact solution is length = 20.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
