[write_program]
This problem asks for the exact value of the sum from k=0 to 24 of (k+1)^(25-k). We'll write a Python program to compute this sum exactly. Since the numbers involved are large but still manageable with Python's arbitrary-precision integers, we'll compute the sum directly.

```python
def compute_sum():
    total = 0
    for k in range(25):
        term = (k + 1) ** (25 - k)
        total += term
        print(f"k={k}: term={term}, running total={total}")
    print("\nFinal sum:", total)

compute_sum()
```
