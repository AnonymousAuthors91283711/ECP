  (∀ a b, 2 ≤ a → 2 ≤ b → a ≠ b → f a * f b = f (a^2 * b^2))) ↔ omnimath589_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for functions with f(n) ≤ 3 and n ≤ 6...
No more candidates found in this range.
. Expected Answer Type: Prop
<<<True>>> 

Explanation: The enumerated search found no functions satisfying the given conditions, suggesting the statement is vacuously true. The non-existence of such a function makes the negation hold.
