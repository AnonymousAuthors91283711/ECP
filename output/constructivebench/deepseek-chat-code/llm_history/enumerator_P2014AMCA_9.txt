This problem involves finding a relationship between the average of five consecutive integers starting at 'a' and the average of five consecutive integers starting at 'b', where b is defined as the average of the first five numbers. The Python program will enumerate small integer values of 'a' and compute both averages to observe the pattern.

```python
def compute_averages(a):
    # Compute first average b
    sum1 = a + (a + 1) + (a + 2) + (a + 3) + (a + 4)
    b = sum1 // 5
    
    # Compute second average
    sum2 = b + (b + 1) + (b + 2) + (b + 3) + (b + 4)
    avg2 = sum2 // 5
    
    return b, avg2

def main():
    # Test small integer values of a
    for a in range(0, 11):
        b, result = compute_averages(a)
        print(f"a={a}, b={b}, result={result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
