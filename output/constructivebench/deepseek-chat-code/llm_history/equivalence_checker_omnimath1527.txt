Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | ∃ b : ℕ, n = 3 ^ b}
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, n = 3^k}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer and the ground truth answer are equivalent. Both express the set of natural numbers that are powers of 3. The only difference is the choice of variable name (b vs k) and notation (3^b vs 3^k), which doesn't affect the meaning. The mathematical content is identical.
