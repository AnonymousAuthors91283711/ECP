[write_program]
This problem asks to find all functions f: ℤ → ℤ that satisfy the condition:
For all integers x, y, z with x + y + z = 0, we have f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = x*y*z.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible polynomial solutions of low degree (since polynomial solutions are often good candidates for functional equations). We'll test quadratic functions first since the right-hand side is degree 3.

```python
def test_function(f):
    # Test the function f on small integer values
    for x in range(-5, 6):
        for y in range(-5, 6):
            z = -x - y
            if f(x) + f(y) + f(z) != x * y * z:
                return False
    return True

# Try quadratic functions f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c
print("Searching quadratic solutions f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c:")
found = False
for a in range(-5, 6):
    for b in range(-5, 6):
        for c in range(-5, 6):
            def f(x):
                return a*x*x + b*x + c
            if test_function(f):
                print(f"Found solution: f(x) = {a}x^2 + {b}x + {c}")
                found = True

if not found:
    print("No quadratic solutions found")

# Try cubic functions if quadratic fails
print("\nSearching cubic solutions f(x) = a*x^3 + b*x^2 + c*x + d:")
found = False
for a in range(-5, 6):
    for b in range(-5, 6):
        for c in range(-5, 6):
            for d in range(-5, 6):
                def f(x):
                    return a*x*x*x + b*x*x + c*x + d
                if test_function(f):
                    print(f"Found solution: f(x) = {a}x^3 + {b}x^2 + {c}x + {d}")
                    found = True

if not found:
    print("No cubic solutions found")
```
