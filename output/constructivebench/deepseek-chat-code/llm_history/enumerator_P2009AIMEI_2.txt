[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that there exists a complex number z with imaginary part 164, where z is the product of terms (1 + (k+1)*i) for k from 0 to n-1. We'll write a Python program to enumerate these products and find the smallest n where the imaginary part equals 164.

The approach:
1. Compute the product iteratively for increasing n
2. Track both real and imaginary parts separately
3. Check when the imaginary part equals 164
4. Stop at a reasonable threshold (n=100) since competition problems typically have small answers

```python
def find_min_n():
    # We'll represent the complex product as (real_part, imag_part)
    # Initialize with the first term (1 + 1i)
    real, imag = 1, 1
    n = 1
    
    while n <= 100:
        if imag == 164:
            print(f"Found n = {n}")
            return n
        
        # Multiply by next term (1 + (n+1)i)
        next_k = n + 1
        new_real = real * 1 - imag * next_k
        new_imag = real * next_k + imag * 1
        real, imag = new_real, new_imag
        n += 1
    
    print("No solution found up to n=100")
    return None

find_min_n()
```
