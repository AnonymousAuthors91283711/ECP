This problem involves finding if there exists a sequence of steps that transforms an initial coloring of 99 nodes arranged in a cycle to a target coloring, following specific transition rules. The initial coloring alternates between red and blue, while the target has one yellow node at position 98 and alternates elsewhere.

We'll write a Python program to simulate this process for small cycle sizes (n) to identify patterns and help conjecture the answer for n=99.

```python
from enum import Enum, auto

class Color(Enum):
    RED = auto()
    BLUE = auto()
    YELLOW = auto()

def simulate(n):
    # Initial state: alternating colors
    initial = [Color.RED if i % 2 == 0 else Color.BLUE for i in range(n)]
    # Target state: alternating except last is yellow
    target = [Color.RED if i % 2 == 0 else Color.BLUE for i in range(n-1)] + [Color.YELLOW]
    
    current = initial.copy()
    steps = 0
    
    while True:
        if current == target:
            return steps
        
        # Find possible moves (nodes where we can change color)
        possible_moves = []
        for k in range(n):
            left = (k - 1) % n
            right = (k + 1) % n
            # Can change color if neighbors are different from current color
            if current[left] != current[k] and current[right] != current[k]:
                possible_moves.append(k)
        
        if not possible_moves:
            return None  # No solution
        
        # Try changing the first possible node to yellow (heuristic)
        k = next((m for m in possible_moves if current[m] != Color.YELLOW), possible_moves[0])
        new_color = Color.YELLOW if current[k] != Color.YELLOW else Color.RED
        
        # Apply the change
        new_state = current.copy()
        new_state[k] = new_color
        current = new_state
        steps += 1
        
        # Print progress for small n
        if n <= 10:
            print(f"Step {steps}: {[c.name for c in current]}")

# Test for small cycle sizes
for n in [3, 5, 7, 9]:
    print(f"\nTesting n = {n}")
    result = simulate(n)
    if result is not None:
        print(f"Solution found in {result} steps")
    else:
        print("No solution found")
```

The program simulates the coloring process for small odd cycle sizes (3,5,7,9). For each step, it finds nodes that can be changed (where neighbors have different colors) and changes them to yellow when possible. The output shows the sequence of states for small n, helping identify patterns that might extend to n=99.
