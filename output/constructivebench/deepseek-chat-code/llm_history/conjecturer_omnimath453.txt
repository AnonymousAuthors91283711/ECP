Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From the enumerated configurations, we observe that all pairs are within a 4x4 subgrid (coordinates range from 0 to 3). The total number of possible positions in a 4x4 grid is 16, and we're looking for sets of size 51 (which seems impossible since 51 > 16). This suggests the problem might be about counting maximal non-attacking configurations, where 51 is likely a typo and should be smaller (perhaps 8, matching the chessboard size). The answer appears to be the number of ways to place non-attacking pieces on a chessboard under these movement rules.
