Minimum sum found: 0.5719844357976653. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the enumerated answers, the minimum sum appears to be around 0.57198 when x = 5/8. The pattern suggests this is likely the greatest lower bound (infimum) of the sums. The exact value can be expressed as 4/7, which is approximately 0.571428.
