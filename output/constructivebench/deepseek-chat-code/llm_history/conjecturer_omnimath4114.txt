abbrev omnimath4114_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath4114 : 
  let L := (10^2022 - 1) / 9
  (digits 10 (9 * L^2 + 2 * L)).sum = omnimath4114_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n | digit_sum(9*L² + 2*L)
-------------------------
1 | 2
2 | 4
3 | 6
4 | 8
5 | 10
6 | 12
7 | 14
8 | 16
9 | 18
10 | 20

Based on the pattern, for n=2022 the sum would be 2022 * 2 = 4044. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<4044>>>
