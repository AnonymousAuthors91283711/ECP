[write_program]
This problem asks for which positive integers n there exists an integer m such that (2^n - 1) divides (m^2 + 9). We'll write a Python program to enumerate small values of n where such an m exists.

The approach is:
1. Iterate n from 1 upwards
2. For each n, compute d = 2^n - 1
3. Check if -9 is a quadratic residue modulo d (i.e., if there exists m such that m^2 ≡ -9 mod d)
4. For small n, we can brute-force check all possible m values up to d

```python
def is_quadratic_residue(a, mod):
    """Check if a is a quadratic residue modulo mod by brute force"""
    if mod == 1:
        return True  # 0^2 ≡ 0 mod 1
    a %= mod
    for m in range(mod):
        if (m * m) % mod == a:
            return True
    return False

max_n = 20  # Check up to n=20
solutions = []

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    d = (1 << n) - 1  # 2^n - 1
    if is_quadratic_residue(-9, d):
        solutions.append(n)
        print(f"Found solution: n = {n}")

print("\nFound solutions up to n={max_n}: {solutions}")
```

The program checks each n from 1 to 20, computes 2^n-1, and verifies if -9 is a quadratic residue modulo that number. It prints each solution as it's found and then summarizes all solutions at the end.

Note: For larger n values, a more efficient approach would be needed since 2^n-1 grows exponentially. The current brute-force method works well for small n values which is sufficient for initial conjectures.
