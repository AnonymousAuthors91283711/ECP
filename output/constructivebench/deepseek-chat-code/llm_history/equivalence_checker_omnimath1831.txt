Ground Truth Answer: {0, I * Real.sqrt 6, -I * Real.sqrt 6}
Proposed Answer: {0} ∪ {(-1 + Complex.I * Real.sqrt 3) / 2, (-1 - Complex.I * Real.sqrt 3) / 2} ∪ {1}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding all complex numbers a, b, c that satisfy the system:
   a² = b - c
   b² = c - a
   c² = a - b
   and relating them to the sum a + b + c.

2. The ground truth answer gives three distinct values for the sum: 0 and ±i√6.

3. The proposed answer gives:
   - {0}
   - Two cube roots of unity (ω and ω²)
   - {1}

Looking at the solutions:
- The sum 0 is correct (trivial solution when a=b=c=0)
- The cube roots of unity are incorrect as sums for this system
- The sum 1 is also incorrect
- The correct non-zero sums ±i√6 are missing

The proposed answer contains some correct elements (0) but is mostly incorrect, missing the key solutions and including invalid ones.
