    (∀ x : ℝ, (x^3 - m * x^2 + 1) * P.eval (x + 1) + (x^3 + m * x^2 + 1) * P.eval (x - 1) = 
    2 * (x^3 - m * x + 1) * P.eval x) ↔ P ∈ omnimath3865_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {P | ∃ c : ℝ, P = C c * X}
Proposed Answer: {P : ℝ[X] | ∃ a : ℝ, P = C a * X}
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The proposed answer and ground truth answer are identical in meaning. Both define the set of real polynomials P that can be expressed as a constant (C c or C a) multiplied by the polynomial X. The only difference is the choice of variable name (c vs a), which doesn't affect the mathematical meaning. Both answers correctly characterize the solution set for the given functional equation.
