[write_program]
This problem involves solving the equation (log x)^(log (log x)) = 10000 for x > 0. We'll write a Python program to find possible solutions by:

1. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify the equation
2. Using numerical methods to approximate solutions
3. Enumerating possible candidates near likely values

The equation can be transformed by taking logs twice, but we'll use a direct numerical approach for enumeration.

```python
import math

def find_solutions():
    # We'll search in two regions: x between 1 and e^e (where log(log(x)) is defined)
    # and x > e^e where the equation might have solutions
    
    # First candidate region: x slightly above 1
    print("Searching in (1, e^e) range:")
    for x in [1.0001, 1.001, 1.01, 1.1, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, math.e]:
        try:
            lhs = math.log(x) ** math.log(math.log(x))
            print(f"x = {x:.5f}, lhs = {lhs:.5f}")
        except ValueError:
            continue
    
    # Second candidate region: x > e^e
    print("\nSearching in (e^e, ∞) range:")
    # We know log(log(x)) grows slowly, so we'll search in exponential steps
    for exp in range(1, 20):
        x = math.exp(math.exp(exp))
        try:
            lhs = math.log(x) ** math.log(math.log(x))
            print(f"x = exp(exp({exp})) ≈ {x:.3g}, lhs = {lhs:.5g}")
            # Check near where lhs crosses 10000
            if abs(lhs - 10000) < 1000:
                # Refine search in this region
                for delta in [-0.1, -0.01, 0, 0.01, 0.1]:
                    x_test = math.exp(math.exp(exp + delta))
                    lhs_test = math.log(x_test) ** math.log(math.log(x_test))
                    print(f"  x = exp(exp({exp+delta:.2f})) ≈ {x_test:.5g}, lhs = {lhs_test:.5g}")
        except ValueError:
            continue
