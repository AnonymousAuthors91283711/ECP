This problem involves counting the number of ways to tile a 2×n rectangle with 1×2 dominoes. The recurrence relation given is the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the two preceding ones. The task is to compute the 10th term in this sequence.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Implement the recurrence relation
2. Compute values up to n=10
3. Print each value as it's computed
4. Finally output the answer for n=10

```python
def tiling_count(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    a, b = 1, 1  # Initialize for n=0 and n=1
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        a, b = b, a + b
        print(f"n={i}: {b}")
    return b

print("Counting domino tilings of 2×n rectangle:")
result = tiling_count(10)
print(f"\nFinal answer for n=10: {result}")
```
