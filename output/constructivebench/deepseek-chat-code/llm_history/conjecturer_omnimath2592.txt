<<<101 * 100!>>> 

Explanation: The problem involves a sequence where each term plus the next term is an odd square. The first term is the sum of factorials from 0 to 100. The pattern suggests the answer relates to 100! multiplied by 101, as this maintains the required properties while being minimal.
