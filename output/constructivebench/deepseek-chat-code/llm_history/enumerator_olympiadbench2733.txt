The problem asks for the sum of the digits of the number obtained by multiplying 888,888 by 9,999,999. To solve this, we can compute the product and then sum its digits. Here's a Python program that does this:

```python
# Compute 888888 * 9999999 and sum its digits
n = 888888 * 9999999
digit_sum = sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
print(digit_sum)
```

The program first calculates the product of 888,888 and 9,999,999, converts the result to a string to access each digit, converts each digit back to an integer, and sums them up. The final output is the sum of all digits in the product.
