This problem asks for the sum of the digits of (1001)^2 when written in base 10. We'll compute this directly in Python by calculating (1001)^2, converting it to a string, then summing its digits.

```python
def compute_digit_sum():
    n = (10**3 + 1)**2  # Calculate (1001)^2
    digit_sum = sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
    print(f"Digits: {str(n)}, Sum: {digit_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_digit_sum()
```
