From the enumerated answers, we can observe two patterns:
1. When p=2, solutions follow (k, m, 2^k + 2^m, 2) and (m, k, 2^k + 2^m, 2) for any k,m ≥1
2. The only other solution is (4, 2, 5, 3)

<<<{(a, b, n, p) | (p = 2 ∧ ∃ k m, (a = k ∧ b = m ∨ a = m ∧ b = k) ∧ n = 2^k + 2^m) ∨ (a = 4 ∧ b = 2 ∧ n = 5 ∧ p = 3)}>>>
