[write_program]
The problem asks to find all positive real numbers `a` for which there exist three distinct real numbers `b, c, d` (all distinct from each other and from `a`) such that:
1. The sum of function values `f(a) + f(b) = f(c) + f(d)`
2. The product `a*b = c*d`
where `f(x) = 2xÂ³ - 2x`.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of `a` and check the conditions. The approach is:
1. Iterate over candidate `a` values in a reasonable range
2. For each `a`, try to find `b, c, d` satisfying the conditions
3. Print `a` when valid solutions are found

```python
import numpy as np

def f(x):
    return 2*x**3 - 2*x

def find_solutions():
    # Sample a range of positive a values
    for a in np.linspace(0.1, 5.0, 1000):
        found = False
        # Try to find b such that we can satisfy conditions
        for b in np.linspace(-5, 5, 200):
            if b == a or b == 0:
                continue
            # From a*b = c*d, express d = (a*b)/c
            # Then solve f(a)+f(b) = f(c)+f((a*b)/c)
            # This gives a nonlinear equation in c
            def equation(c):
                if c == 0 or c == a or c == b:
                    return float('inf')
                d = (a*b)/c
                if d == a or d == b or d == c:
                    return float('inf')
                return abs(f(a) + f(b) - f(c) - f(d))
            
            # Find roots numerically
            for c in np.linspace(-5, 5, 200):
                if c == 0 or c == a or c == b:
                    continue
                if equation(c) < 1e-6:
                    d = (a*b)/c
                    # Check all distinct
                    if len({a, b, c, d}) == 4:
                        print(f"Found solution: a={a:.5f}, b={b:.5f}, c={c:.5f}, d={d:.5f}")
                        found = True
                        break
            if found:
                break
        if found:
            print(f"Valid a found: {a:.5f}")

find_solutions()
```

The program samples values of `a` and attempts to find corresponding `b, c, d` that satisfy the conditions. It prints each valid `a` found along with example values of `b, c, d`. The numerical precision is limited, so results should be verified analytically.
