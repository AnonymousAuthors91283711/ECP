This problem asks for the number of subsets S of Fin 16 (integers modulo 16) that satisfy a certain property P. The property P states that for every x in S, 2x mod 16 must also be in S. We'll enumerate all possible subsets of Fin 16 that satisfy this condition.

The key observation is that the condition creates a dependency chain: if x is in S, then 2x, 4x, 8x, etc. must also be in S (until the sequence cycles). We can model this by considering each element's orbit under doubling modulo 16.

```python
def solve():
    n = 16
    # Each element's orbit under doubling mod 16
    orbits = {
        0: [0],
        1: [1, 2, 4, 8],
        3: [3, 6, 12, 8],
        5: [5, 10, 4, 8],
        7: [7, 14, 12, 8],
        9: [9, 2, 4, 8],
        11: [11, 6, 12, 8],
        13: [13, 10, 4, 8],
        15: [15, 14, 12, 8]
    }
    
    # The independent choices are:
    # - Whether to include 0 (1 choice, since it's self-contained)
    # - For each orbit, whether to include none, first half, or all elements
    #   (since once you include one element, you must include all subsequent ones in its orbit)
    
    # Count choices for each orbit group
    # Orbits can be grouped by their cycle pattern:
    # - The 0 orbit (1 choice: include or not)
    # - The 4-element orbits (3 choices each: none, first half, or all)
    #   (first half means up to but not including the cycle point)
    
    # There are 8 orbits with 4 elements each (all except 0)
    # Each has 3 choices (none, first 2 elements, or all 4)
    # Plus 2 choices for 0 (include or not)
    
    total = 2 * (3 ** 8)
    print(total)
