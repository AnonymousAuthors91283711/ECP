Ground Truth Answer: 600 / 7
Proposed Answer: (10 / 60 * 60 + 3 / 60 * 60) / (10 / 60)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

Problem Breakdown:
1. We need to find a unique positive speed v (km/h) where:
   - Trains come every 3 minutes (3/60 hours)
   - It takes Linh 10 minutes (10/60 hours) to pass a train
   - Linh's speed is 60 km/h
   - The equation relates these quantities

Key Equation:
passing_interval = train_distance / relative_speed
10/60 = (v * 3/60) / (v - 60)

Ground Truth Solution:
Solving the equation:
10/60 = (3v/60)/(v-60)
=> 10(v-60) = 3v
=> 10v - 600 = 3v
=> 7v = 600
=> v = 600/7 ≈ 85.714 km/h

Proposed Answer:
(10/60 * 60 + 3/60 * 60) / (10/60)
= (10 + 3) / (10/60)
= 13 * 6
= 78 km/h

Comparison:
The ground truth is 600/7 ≈ 85.714 km/h
The proposed answer is 78 km/h
These are clearly different values.
