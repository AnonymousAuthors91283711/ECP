This problem appears to be a simple arithmetic calculation rather than requiring enumeration. The expression (1 + (3 * 5)) / 2 evaluates to (1 + 15)/2 = 16/2 = 8. Since there's no need for enumeration or approximation, we can directly compute and print the exact value.

```python
# Simple arithmetic calculation for (1 + (3 * 5)) / 2
result = (1 + (3 * 5)) / 2
print(result)
```
