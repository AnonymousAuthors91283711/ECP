The problem asks for the number of pairs (a, b) of positive integers such that the sum of logarithms (base 8) of a*b^k for k from 0 to 11 equals 2006. We need to enumerate possible (a, b) pairs that satisfy this condition.

The logarithmic sum can be simplified using logarithm properties:
sum_{k=0}^11 log8(a*b^k) = log8(a^12 * b^(0+1+...+11)) = log8(a^12 * b^66) = 12log8(a) + 66log8(b) = 2006

This implies a^12 * b^66 = 8^2006, which simplifies to a^2 * b^11 = 8^(2006/6) = (2^3)^(1003/3) = 2^1003

Thus, we need to find all positive integer pairs (a, b) such that a^2 * b^11 = 2^1003.

We'll enumerate possible exponents of 2 in b (since b must be a power of 2), then compute the corresponding a.

```python
def solve():
    target_exp = 1003
    count = 0
    
    # b must be 2^k where 11*k <= 1003
    max_k = target_exp // 11
    
    for k in range(0, max_k + 1):
        remaining_exp = target_exp - 11 * k
        if remaining_exp % 2 == 0:
            # a must be 2^(remaining_exp/2)
            count += 1
            print(f"Found pair: a=2^{remaining_exp//2}, b=2^{k}")
    
    print(f"Total number of valid pairs: {count}")

solve()
```
