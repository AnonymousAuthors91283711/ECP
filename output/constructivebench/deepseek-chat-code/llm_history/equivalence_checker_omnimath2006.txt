Ground Truth Answer: 1006
Proposed Answer: 1 + (2012 - 1) / 2
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer "1 + (2012 - 1) / 2" is algebraically equivalent to 1006 (since 1 + (2012-1)/2 = 1 + 2011/2 = 1 + 1005.5 = 1006.5, which would need to be rounded down to 1006 for integer results). However, the exact form differs from the ground truth answer of 1006. The mathematical content is essentially correct, but the presentation isn't precise since it doesn't specify integer division or rounding. Therefore, I'm marking this as "Close" since it's mathematically equivalent in spirit but not in exact form.
