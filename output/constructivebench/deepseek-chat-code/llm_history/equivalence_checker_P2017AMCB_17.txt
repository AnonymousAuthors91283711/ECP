Ground Truth Answer: 2 / 81
Proposed Answer: 19/81
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. First, let's compute pA and pB based on the given definitions:
   - pA = (2/3)³ + (1/3)³ = 8/27 + 1/27 = 9/27 = 1/3
   - pB = 2*(2/3)²*(1/3)² = 2*(4/9)*(1/9) = 8/81

2. Now compute pA - pB:
   - pA - pB = 1/3 - 8/81 = 27/81 - 8/81 = 19/81

3. The ground truth answer is 2/81, which doesn't match our calculation.
4. The proposed answer is 19/81, which matches our calculation exactly.

The ground truth answer appears to be incorrect, while the proposed answer is correct based on the given definitions and calculations.
