[write_program]
This problem asks to find all triples of positive integers (a, b, c) such that:
1. a*b - c is a power of 2
2. b*c - a is a power of 2
3. c*a - b is a power of 2

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such triples up to a reasonable limit (100) to find patterns and potential solutions.

```python
def find_triples(max_limit=100):
    # Precompute powers of 2 up to max_limit^2
    powers_of_2 = set()
    k = 0
    while True:
        power = 2 ** k
        if power > max_limit * max_limit:
            break
        powers_of_2.add(power)
        k += 1

    solutions = []
    for a in range(1, max_limit + 1):
        for b in range(1, max_limit + 1):
            ab = a * b
            if ab - 1 not in powers_of_2:
                continue
            for c in range(1, max_limit + 1):
                bc = b * c
                ca = c * a
                if (bc - a in powers_of_2 and 
                    ca - b in powers_of_2):
                    solutions.append((a, b, c))
                    print(f"Found solution: {a}, {b}, {c}")
    
    print("\nAll solutions found:")
    for sol in solutions:
        print(sol)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_triples()
