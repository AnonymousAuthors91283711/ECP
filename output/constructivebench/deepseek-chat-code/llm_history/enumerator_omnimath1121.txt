This problem involves calculating the expected number of coins after 100 rounds of a process where the number of coins increases by 1% each round, starting with 1 coin. The exact value is (1 + 1/100)^100, which approaches e (Euler's number) as rounds increase.

We'll compute this value exactly as a fraction and approximately as a floating-point number. The exact fraction will be very large, so we'll also show its decimal approximation.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_expected_coins():
    # Starting with 1 coin, 100 rounds of 1% growth
    exact = Fraction(1)
    for _ in range(100):
        exact = exact * Fraction(101, 100)
    
    # Print exact fraction (numerator and denominator)
    print(f"Exact fraction: {exact.numerator}/{exact.denominator}")
    
    # Compute decimal approximation
    approx = float(exact)
    print(f"Decimal approximation: {approx:.15f}")

    # Compare with e (for reference)
    import math
    print(f"Comparison with e: {math.e:.15f}")

    compute_expected_coins()
