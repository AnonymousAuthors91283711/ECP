[write_program]
This problem asks for pairs of integers (m,n) such that any set A containing m and n, and closed under the operation x² + kxy + y² for any integer k, must be the entire set of integers. We'll write a Python program to enumerate candidate pairs (m,n) and test small cases to identify patterns.

The approach:
1. For small integer values of m and n, simulate the closure process starting with {m,n}
2. Check if the generated set becomes all integers
3. Output pairs that satisfy this condition

```python
def generate_closure(m, n, max_steps=10, max_size=1000):
    """Generate the closure of {m,n} under x² + kxy + y² for all k."""
    current = {m, n}
    for _ in range(max_steps):
        new_elements = set()
        for x in current:
            for y in current:
                # Try k = -2,-1,0,1,2 as representative cases
                for k in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
                    val = x*x + k*x*y + y*y
                    if val not in current:
                        new_elements.add(val)
        if not new_elements:
            break
        current.update(new_elements)
        if len(current) > max_size:
            return None  # Too large, probably not generating all integers
    return current

def test_pair(m, n):
    """Test if {m,n} generates all integers under the operation."""
    closure = generate_closure(m, n)
    if closure is None:
        return False
    # Check if we have enough variety to suspect it generates all integers
    # We'll check if we have consecutive numbers (heuristic)
    elements = sorted(closure)
    for i in range(len(elements)-1):
        if elements[i+1] - elements[i] == 1:
            return True
    return False

def main():
    # Test small integer pairs
    max_test = 5
    print("Testing pairs (m,n) where |m|,|n| ≤", max_test)
    print("Candidate pairs that might generate all integers:")
    
    for m in range(-max_test, max_test+1):
        for n in range(-max_test, max_test+1):
            if m == n or m == 0 or n == 0:
                continue  # Skip trivial cases
            if test_pair(m, n):
                print(f"({m}, {n})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
