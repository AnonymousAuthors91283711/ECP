This problem involves calculating the total distance traveled by a person who alternates between climbing up and sliding down a slope over a fixed time period. The parameters are:
- T = 10 (total height)
- up_time = 80 seconds (time to climb up)
- down_time = 70 seconds (time to slide down)
- total_time = T * 60 = 600 seconds

We need to compute the total distance traveled, accounting for full up-down cycles and any remaining partial cycle.

```python
import math

def calculate_distance():
    T = 10
    up_time = 80
    down_time = 70
    total_time = T * 60
    cycle_time = up_time + down_time
    up_speed = T / up_time
    down_speed = T / down_time
    
    full_cycles = math.floor(total_time / cycle_time)
    remaining_time = total_time - full_cycles * cycle_time
    
    if remaining_time <= up_time:
        remaining_climb = remaining_time * up_speed
    else:
        remaining_climb = T + (remaining_time - up_time) * (-down_speed)
    
    total_distance = full_cycles * (T + T) + remaining_climb
    return total_distance

print(calculate_distance())
```
