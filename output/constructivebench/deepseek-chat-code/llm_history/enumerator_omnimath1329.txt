This problem involves finding a degree 5 polynomial P with complex coefficients such that:
1. For any complex z satisfying z⁵ + 2004z = 1, P(z²) = 0
2. The ratio P(1)/P(-1) equals some specific real number (which we need to find)

We'll approach this by:
1. Finding the roots of z⁵ + 2004z - 1 = 0
2. Computing their squares
3. Constructing P from these squared roots
4. Evaluating P at 1 and -1 to find the ratio

Here's a Python program to numerically approximate the solution:

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.polynomial import Polynomial

# Find roots of z^5 + 2004z - 1 = 0
coefficients = [1, 0, 0, 0, 2004, -1]
roots = np.roots(coefficients)

# Compute squares of the roots
squared_roots = [r**2 for r in roots]

# Construct the polynomial P with roots at squared_roots
P = Polynomial.fromroots(squared_roots)

# Evaluate P at 1 and -1
P1 = P(1)
P_neg1 = P(-1)

# Compute the ratio
ratio = P1 / P_neg1

print("Roots of z^5 + 2004z - 1 = 0:")
for i, r in enumerate(roots):
    print(f"z_{i} = {r}")

print("\nSquared roots (roots of P):")
for i, sr in enumerate(squared_roots):
    print(f"r_{i} = {sr}")

print("\nPolynomial P coefficients:")
print(P.coef)

print("\nP(1) =", P1)
print("P(-1) =", P_neg1)
print("Ratio P(1)/P(-1) =", ratio)
```
