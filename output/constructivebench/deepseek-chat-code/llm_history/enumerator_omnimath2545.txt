This problem involves calculating a sum of binomial probabilities where k ranges from 4 to 8 (since Finset.range 9 gives 0-8), with each term being (8 choose k) * (1/2)^8 for k â‰¥ 4. We'll compute this sum exactly in Python using fractions to maintain precision.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from math import comb

def calculate_sum():
    total = Fraction(0)
    n = 8
    p = Fraction(1, 2)
    for k in range(4, 9):  # k from 4 to 8 inclusive
        term = Fraction(comb(n, k)) * (p ** n)
        total += term
        print(f"k={k}: term={term}, cumulative={total}")
    print("\nExact sum:", total)

calculate_sum()
```
