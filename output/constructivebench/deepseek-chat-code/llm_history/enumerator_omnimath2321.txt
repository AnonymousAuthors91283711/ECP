[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of two equations with two variables x and y, where each is defined in terms of the other through logarithmic functions. We'll write a Python program to numerically approximate solutions to this system by iterating the equations.

The approach will be:
1. Start with an initial guess for y
2. Compute x using the first equation
3. Compute a new y using the second equation
4. Repeat until convergence
5. Calculate 10^(x-y) for the converged values

```python
import math

def solve_system(max_iter=100, tolerance=1e-10):
    # Initial guess for y
    y = 0.0
    for _ in range(max_iter):
        # Compute x using first equation
        x = math.log10(10**(y - 1) + 1) - 1
        # Compute new y using second equation
        new_y = math.log10(10**x + 1) - 1
        # Check for convergence
        if abs(new_y - y) < tolerance:
            break
        y = new_y
    # Calculate and return 10^(x-y)
    return 10**(x - y)

result = solve_system()
print(f"Approximate solution: {result}")
print(f"Possible exact form: 10/9 â‰ˆ {10/9}")
```
