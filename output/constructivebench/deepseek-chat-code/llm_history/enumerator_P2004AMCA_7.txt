The problem involves iteratively transforming a tuple (x,y,z) by subtracting the sum of the other two plus 1 from the largest element, until at least one element becomes zero. We need to find the maximum number of iterations possible before this termination condition is met, starting from (15,14,13).

Here's a Python program that simulates this process and counts the iterations:

```python
def count_iterations(a, b, c):
    x, y, z = a, b, c
    count = 0
    while x > 0 and y > 0 and z > 0:
        if x >= y and x >= z:
            new_x = x - (y + z + 1)
            new_y = y + 1
            new_z = z + 1
        elif y >= x and y >= z:
            new_x = x + 1
            new_y = y - (x + z + 1)
            new_z = z + 1
        else:
            new_x = x + 1
            new_y = y + 1
            new_z = z - (x + y + 1)
        x, y, z = new_x, new_y, new_z
        count += 1
        print(f"Iteration {count}: ({x}, {y}, {z})")
    return count

a, b, c = 15, 14, 13
print(f"Starting with ({a}, {b}, {c})")
max_iterations = count_iterations(a, b, c)
print(f"Maximum iterations: {max_iterations}")
```
