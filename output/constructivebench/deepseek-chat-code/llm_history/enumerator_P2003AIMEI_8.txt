[write_program]
This problem involves finding four positive integers a < b < c < d satisfying several conditions, including arithmetic and geometric relationships, and a final sum condition. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of a, b, c, d that satisfy all the given constraints.

The constraints are:
1. 0 < a < b < c < d
2. 2*b = a + c (arithmetic condition)
3. c² = b*d (geometric condition)
4. d - a = 30
5. The sum a + b + c + d should be found

We'll iterate through possible values of a and derive other variables from the constraints, checking all conditions.

```python
def solve():
    for a in range(1, 100):  # Reasonable upper bound for a
        # From d - a = 30, we get d = a + 30
        d = a + 30
        # From 2*b = a + c, we get c = 2*b - a
        # From c² = b*d, substitute c:
        # (2*b - a)² = b*(a + 30)
        # Expand and rearrange:
        # 4b² - 4ab + a² = ab + 30b
        # 4b² - 5ab - 30b + a² = 0
        # This is a quadratic in b: 4b² + (-5a - 30)b + a² = 0
        # Solve for b using quadratic formula
        discriminant = (5*a + 30)**2 - 16*a*a
        if discriminant < 0:
            continue
        sqrt_disc = int(discriminant**0.5)
        if sqrt_disc * sqrt_disc != discriminant:
            continue
        
        # Possible b values
        b1 = (5*a + 30 + sqrt_disc) // 8
        b2 = (5*a + 30 - sqrt_disc) // 8
        
        for b in [b1, b2]:
            if b <= a:
                continue
            c = 2*b - a
            if c <= b:
                continue
            if c >= d:
                continue
            if c*c != b*d:
                continue
            total = a + b + c + d
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, sum={total}")

solve()
```
