The problem asks for the largest integer `n` such that the total volume of `n` spheres each with radius 4 does not exceed the volume of a single sphere with radius 10. The volume of a sphere is given by (4/3)πr³. We need to find the maximum `n` where n*(4/3)π4³ ≤ (4/3)π10³. The (4/3)π terms cancel out, simplifying to n*4³ ≤ 10³ → n ≤ (10/4)³ → n ≤ (2.5)³ → n ≤ 15.625. Since n must be an integer, the maximum valid n is 15.

Here's a Python program that verifies this by checking all integers up to a reasonable threshold:

```python
import math

def calculate_max_spheres():
    # Calculate the volume ratio (10^3 / 4^3)
    max_n = (10**3) / (4**3)
    print(f"Exact maximum n before rounding: {max_n}")
    
    # Check all integers up to 20 (safe upper bound)
    for n in range(1, 21):
        if n * (4**3) <= (10**3):
            print(f"Valid: {n}")
        else:
            print(f"Invalid: {n} (exceeds volume)")
    
    # Explicitly output the maximum valid integer
    print(f"\nMaximum number of spheres: {math.floor(max_n)}")

calculate_max_spheres()
```
