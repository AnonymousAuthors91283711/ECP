Ground Truth Answer: 962
Proposed Answer: 2 * (3 ^ 5 - 2 ^ 5) - 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting valid arrangements on a 5×5 grid where for every point in the set, either its entire row or its entire column must be in the set.

2. The ground truth answer is 962, which comes from counting all possible such arrangements.

3. The proposed answer is 2*(3^5 - 2^5) - 1 = 2*(243-32)-1 = 2*211-1 = 422-1 = 421, which doesn't match 962.

4. The proposed formula seems to be attempting to count arrangements where either all rows or all columns satisfy certain conditions, but it's missing many cases (like mixed row/column selections).

5. The actual count should consider all possible combinations of selecting full rows and full columns, minus overlaps, which leads to a much larger number (962).
