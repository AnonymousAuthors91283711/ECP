This problem involves finding a natural number `n` (other than 17) such that the binomial coefficients C(40,17) and C(40,n) are equal. Since binomial coefficients are symmetric (C(n,k) = C(n,n-k)), the answer should be 40-17 = 23.

We'll write a Python program to verify this by:
1. Calculating C(40,17)
2. Calculating C(40,n) for all n from 1 to 40 (excluding 17)
3. Finding where they match

```python
import math

def main():
    T = 43
    base = T - 3  # 40
    k = 17
    target = math.comb(base, k)
    
    print(f"Calculating C({base}, {k}) = {target}")
    print("Searching for n where C(40,n) equals C(40,17):")
    
    for n in range(1, base+1):
        if n == k:
            continue
        current = math.comb(base, n)
        if current == target:
            print(f"Found match at n = {n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
