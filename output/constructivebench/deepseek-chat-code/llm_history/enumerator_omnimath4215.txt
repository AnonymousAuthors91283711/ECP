[write_program]
This problem involves matrix operations and conditions on the solution vector. We'll write a Python program to enumerate small integer values for m, a, b, c and check the conditions in the theorem. The program will:

1. Generate small integer values for m (excluding 1 and -2)
2. For each m, generate small integer values for a, b, c
3. Construct the matrix A and vector b_vec
4. Check if the system has a unique solution
5. Check if the solution satisfies the difference condition x1 - x0 = x2 - x1

```python
import numpy as np

def main():
    # Try small integer values for m (excluding 1 and -2)
    for m in [-3, -1, 0, 2, 3]:
        print(f"\nTesting m = {m}")
        # Try small integer values for a, b, c
        for a in range(-2, 3):
            for b in range(-2, 3):
                for c in range(-2, 3):
                    # Construct matrix A
                    A = np.array([
                        [1, 1, m],
                        [1, m, 1],
                        [m, 1, 1]
                    ])
                    # Construct vector b
                    b_vec = np.array([a, b, c])
                    
                    try:
                        # Solve the system
                        x = np.linalg.solve(A, b_vec)
                        # Check the difference condition
                        if np.isclose(x[1] - x[0], x[2] - x[1]):
                            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}: solution {x} satisfies condition")
                    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
                        # Skip if matrix is singular
                        continue

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
