This problem involves calculating the probability that a 13-card hand from a standard 52-card deck has exactly 4 high cards (10, J, Q, K, A) and a point value of at least 13, where points are assigned as: A=4, K=3, Q=2, J=1. We'll enumerate all possible combinations to estimate this probability.

The approach:
1. Generate all combinations of 13 cards from 52
2. Filter hands with exactly 4 high cards (10/J/Q/K/A)
3. Calculate point values for qualifying hands
4. Count hands meeting the point threshold
5. Compute probability as ratio of qualifying hands to total hands with 4 high cards

Since enumerating all combinations is computationally intensive, we'll use combinatorics to count valid combinations efficiently.

```python
import math
from itertools import combinations

def point_value(hand):
    points = 0
    for card in hand:
        rank = card % 13
        if rank == 0:   # Ace
            points += 4
        elif rank == 12: # King
            points += 3
        elif rank == 11: # Queen
            points += 2
        elif rank == 10: # Jack
            points += 1
    return points

    high_cards = [c for c in deck if c % 13 >= 10]
    other_cards = [c for c in deck if c % 13 < 10]
    
    total_valid = 0
    qualifying = 0
    
    # Choose 4 high cards from 20 (5 ranks * 4 suits)

        remaining_high = len(high_cards) - 4
        # Choose 9 other cards from 32 (8 ranks * 4 suits)
        for other_combo in combinations(other_cards, 9):
            hand = high_combo + other_combo
            total_valid += 1
            if point_value(hand) >= 13:
                qualifying += 1
            if total_valid % 100000 == 0:
                print(f"Progress: {total_valid} combinations checked, {qualifying} qualifying")
    
    print(f"Total valid hands: {total_valid}")
    print(f"Qualifying hands: {qualifying}")
    print(f"Probability: {qualifying/total_valid}")

    # Total ways to choose 9 other cards from 32

    # For qualifying hands, we need point_value >= 13
    # We need to count combinations of high cards that sum to >=13 points
