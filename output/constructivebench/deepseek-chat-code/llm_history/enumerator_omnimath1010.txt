This problem involves finding the number of real triples (x, y, z) that satisfy a system of equations involving sign functions. The sign function returns 1 for positive inputs, -1 for negative inputs, and 0 for zero inputs. We'll enumerate all possible cases based on the sign of (y+z), (z+x), and (x+y).

The approach is to consider all possible combinations of sign function outputs (-1, 0, 1) for each equation, then solve the resulting linear systems and count valid solutions.

```python
def enumerate_solutions():
    count = 0
    # Possible sign values: -1, 0, 1
    for s1 in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for s2 in [-1, 0, 1]:
            for s3 in [-1, 0, 1]:
                # System of equations:
                # x = 2018 - 2019*s1 where s1 = sign(y+z)
                # y = 2018 - 2019*s2 where s2 = sign(z+x)
                # z = 2018 - 2019*s3 where s3 = sign(x+y)
                x = 2018 - 2019 * s1
                y = 2018 - 2019 * s2
                z = 2018 - 2019 * s3
                
                # Check consistency of sign conditions
                valid = True
                if (y + z > 0 and s1 != 1) or (y + z < 0 and s1 != -1) or (y + z == 0 and s1 != 0):
                    valid = False
                if (z + x > 0 and s2 != 1) or (z + x < 0 and s2 != -1) or (z + x == 0 and s2 != 0):
                    valid = False
                if (x + y > 0 and s3 != 1) or (x + y < 0 and s3 != -1) or (x + y == 0 and s3 != 0):
                    valid = False
                
                if valid:
                    count += 1
                    print(f"Solution found: x={x}, y={y}, z={z} with signs {s1},{s2},{s3}")
    
    print(f"Total number of solutions: {count}")

enumerate_solutions()
```
