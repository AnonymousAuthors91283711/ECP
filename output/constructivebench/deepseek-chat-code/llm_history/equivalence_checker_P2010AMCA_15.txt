Ground Truth Answer: (3 - sqrt 3) / 6
Proposed Answer: (1 - Real.sqrt (1/3)) / 2
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground truth: (3 - √3)/6
Proposed answer: (1 - √(1/3))/2

Let's simplify both expressions:

1. Ground truth:
(3 - √3)/6 = 3/6 - √3/6 = 1/2 - √3/6

2. Proposed answer:
(1 - √(1/3))/2 = 1/2 - √(1/3)/2 = 1/2 - (1/√3)/2 = 1/2 - 1/(2√3)

Now let's compare the second terms:
√3/6 vs 1/(2√3)

Multiply numerator and denominator of √3/6 by √3:
(√3 * √3)/(6 * √3) = 3/(6√3) = 1/(2√3)

Thus, both expressions are identical:
1/2 - √3/6 = 1/2 - 1/(2√3)
