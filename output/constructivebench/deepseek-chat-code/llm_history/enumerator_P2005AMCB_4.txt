The problem is to find the greatest number of quizzes where the student could have received a grade of B, given:
- Total quizzes = 50
- First 22 quizzes have A's
- Need at least 80% (4/5) A's overall
- At least 30 quizzes must be taken

We need to maximize the number of B's (which is total quizzes - 30 - remaining A's after the first 22).

Here's a Python program to enumerate possible solutions:

```python
def enumerate_solutions():
    total_quizzes = 50
    first_A = 22
    min_quizzes = 30
    
    max_B = 0
    # Iterate possible remaining A counts
    for remaining_A in range(0, total_quizzes - first_A + 1):
        total_A = first_A + remaining_A
        # Check if meets 80% A requirement
        if total_A >= 4 * total_quizzes / 5:
            # Calculate possible B's (total - min_quizzes - remaining_A)
            possible_B = (total_quizzes - min_quizzes) - remaining_A
            if possible_B > max_B:
                max_B = possible_B
                print(f"Found new maximum B: {max_B} (with remaining_A={remaining_A})")
    
    print(f"\nFinal maximum number of B's: {max_B}")

enumerate_solutions()
```
