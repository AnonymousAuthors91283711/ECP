The problem is to find the value of m given the following system of equations:
1. m = 1.2 * s
2. s = 0.6 * d
3. m + s + d = 23.2

We need to solve for m, s, and d. The solution can be found by substitution. Here's a Python program that solves this system symbolically and outputs the exact value of m:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def solve_problem():
    # Express all variables in terms of d
    # s = 0.6d (from second equation)
    # m = 1.2s = 1.2 * 0.6d = 0.72d (from first equation)
    
    # Substitute into third equation: 0.72d + 0.6d + d = 23.2
    # Total coefficient: 0.72 + 0.6 + 1 = 2.32
    # So d = 23.2 / 2.32 = 10
    
    # Calculate exact fractions to avoid floating point inaccuracies
    d = Fraction(232, 100) / Fraction(232, 100)
    d = Fraction(23.2).limit_denominator() / Fraction(2.32).limit_denominator()
    
    # More precise calculation using exact fractions
    # 23.2 = 232/10, 2.32 = 232/100
    d = Fraction(232, 10) / Fraction(232, 100)
    
    s = Fraction(6, 10) * d
    m = Fraction(12, 10) * s
    
    # Print exact value as fraction
    print(f"Exact value of m: {m} = {float(m)}")
    
    # Alternatively, we can compute directly:
    # m = 0.72d = 0.72 * 10 = 7.2
    print("Alternative verification:")
    d = 10.0
    s = 0.6 * d
    m = 1.2 * s
    print(f"m = {m}")
