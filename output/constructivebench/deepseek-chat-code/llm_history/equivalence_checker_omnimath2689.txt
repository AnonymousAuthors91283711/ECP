theorem omnimath2689 (wednesdayPoints fridayPoints : ℕ) :
    fridayPoints = wednesdayPoints * 80 / 100 ↔ fridayPoints = omnimath2689_answer wednesdayPoints := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun wednesdayPoints => wednesdayPoints * 80 / 100
Proposed Answer: fun wednesdayPoints : ℕ => wednesdayPoints / 5 * 4
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but not exactly equivalent to the ground truth. While `wednesdayPoints * 80 / 100` and `wednesdayPoints / 5 * 4` often produce the same result, they differ in cases where `wednesdayPoints` is not divisible by 5 due to integer division truncation. For example:
- When wednesdayPoints = 6:
  - Ground truth: 6*80/100 = 480/100 = 4
  - Proposed: 6/5*4 = 1*4 = 4 (same)
- When wednesdayPoints = 7:
  - Ground truth: 7*80/100 = 560/100 = 5
  - Proposed: 7/5*4 = 1*4 = 4 (different)
So the answers are equivalent only when wednesdayPoints is divisible by 5 or when the truncation doesn't affect the result.
