No quadratic solutions found

Searching cubic solutions f(x) = a*x^3 + b*x^2 + c*x + d:
No cubic solutions found. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ → ℤ)
Based on the problem statement and the enumeration results showing no polynomial solutions up to cubic degree, the solution appears to be the empty set since no functions satisfy the given condition. The condition requires a very specific relationship between function values that polynomial functions cannot satisfy.
