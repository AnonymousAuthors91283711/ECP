[write_program]
This problem involves finding the minimal number of cell changes needed to transform a 5x5 binary matrix with 15 True entries into a 3-regular matrix (each row and column has exactly 3 True entries). We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible matrices and compute the minimal changes required.

The approach:
1. Generate all possible 5x5 matrices with exactly 15 True entries (there are C(25,15) possibilities, but we'll limit to small cases)
2. For each matrix, find the minimal changes needed to make it 3-regular
3. Track the minimal number of changes found

Since enumerating all matrices is computationally expensive, we'll:
- Use small random samples
- Implement efficient checks for 3-regularity
- Track the minimal changes found

```python
import itertools
import numpy as np
from collections import defaultdict

def is_3_regular(matrix):
    """Check if matrix is 3-regular (3 Trues per row/column)"""
    for row in matrix:
        if sum(row) != 3:
            return False
    for col in zip(*matrix):
        if sum(col) != 3:
            return False
    return True

def count_changes(original, target):
    """Count positions where original and target differ"""
    return sum(1 for i in range(5) for j in range(5) if original[i][j] != target[i][j])

def generate_3_regular_matrices():
    """Generate all 3-regular 5x5 matrices (up to permutation)"""
    # This is computationally intensive, so we'll use a simplified approach
    # Generate all possible row patterns with exactly 3 Trues
    row_patterns = list(itertools.combinations(range(5), 3))
    
    # Try random combinations of rows that might form a 3-regular matrix

                    break
            else:
                break
        if len(matrix) == 5 and is_3_regular(matrix):
            yield matrix
