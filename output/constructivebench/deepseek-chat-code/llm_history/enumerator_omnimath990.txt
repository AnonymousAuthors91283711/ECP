[write_program]
This problem involves summing an infinite series of the form (a * n) / (a^n) for n from 1 to infinity, where a > 1. To help conjecture the closed-form solution, we'll write a Python program to compute partial sums for various values of a and compare them with potential closed-form expressions.

The program will:
1. Select sample values of a > 1
2. Compute partial sums of the series up to a reasonable number of terms
3. Compare with candidate closed-form expressions to help identify the pattern

```python
import math

def compute_partial_sum(a, terms=100):
    """Compute partial sum of (a*n)/a^n series up to given terms"""
    total = 0.0
    for n in range(1, terms+1):
        total += (a * n) / (a ** n)
    return total

def candidate_formula(a):
    """Candidate closed-form expression to test against partial sums"""
    return a / (a - 1)**2

# Test values of a > 1
test_values = [1.1, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 10.0]

print("a\tPartial Sum (100 terms)\tCandidate Formula\tDifference")
for a in test_values:
    partial = compute_partial_sum(a)
    candidate = candidate_formula(a)
    diff = abs(partial - candidate)
    print(f"{a:.2f}\t{partial:.10f}\t\t{candidate:.10f}\t\t{diff:.2e}")
```
