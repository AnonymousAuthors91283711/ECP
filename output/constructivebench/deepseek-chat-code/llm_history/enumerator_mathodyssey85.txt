The problem involves finding the minimum value of \(a^2 + b^2\) such that the maximum distance from the point \((-a, -b)\) to any point on the circle centered at \((0, 4)\) with radius 1 is 6. 

We can approach this by parameterizing the circle and finding the maximum distance condition. The circle can be parameterized as \(D = (cosθ, 4 + sinθ)\). The distance from \((-a, -b)\) to \(D\) is \(\sqrt{(cosθ + a)^2 + (4 + sinθ + b)^2}\). Setting the maximum of this distance to 6 gives us a condition on \(a\) and \(b\).

To find the minimum \(a^2 + b^2\), we can use the fact that the maximum distance occurs when the vector from \((-a, -b)\) to the circle's center plus the radius equals 6. This leads to \(\sqrt{a^2 + (4 + b)^2} + 1 = 6\), which simplifies to \(\sqrt{a^2 + (4 + b)^2} = 5\). Squaring both sides gives \(a^2 + (b + 4)^2 = 25\).

We need to minimize \(a^2 + b^2\) under this constraint. This is equivalent to finding the point on the circle \(a^2 + (b + 4)^2 = 25\) closest to the origin. The minimum distance occurs when the point is in the direction opposite to the center, i.e., \(a = 0\) and \(b = 1\) (since the center is at \((0, -4)\) and radius is 5). Thus, the minimum value is \(0^2 + 1^2 = 1\).

Here's a Python program to verify this by checking small values around the expected minimum:

```python
import math

def verify(a, b):
    # Check if the maximum distance is 6
    max_dist = 0
    for theta in [0, math.pi/2, math.pi, 3*math.pi/2]:  # Check key points
        dx = math.cos(theta) + a
        dy = 4 + math.sin(theta) + b
        dist = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)
        if dist > max_dist:
            max_dist = dist
    if not math.isclose(max_dist, 6, abs_tol=1e-6):
        return False
    
    # Check the circle condition
    if not math.isclose(a**2 + (b + 4)**2, 25, abs_tol=1e-6):
        return False
    
    return True

# Search around the expected minimum (a=0, b=1)
min_sq_sum = float('inf')
best_a, best_b = 0, 0

# Search in a small grid around (0,1)
for a in [x * 0.1 for x in range(-10, 11)]:
    for b in [y * 0.1 for y in range(-5, 15)]:
        if verify(a, b):
            sq_sum = a**2 + b**2
            if sq_sum < min_sq_sum:
                min_sq_sum = sq_sum
                best_a, best_b = a, b
                print(f"Found candidate: a={a:.3f}, b={b:.3f}, a²+b²={sq_sum:.3f}")

print(f"\nMinimum a² + b²: {min_sq_sum:.3f} (a={best_a:.3f}, b={best_b:.3f})")
```
