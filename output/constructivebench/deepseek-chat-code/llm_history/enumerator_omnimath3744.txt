[write_program]
This problem asks to find all quadruples (x,y,z,t) of positive integers satisfying the equation 20^x + 14^(2y) = (x + 2y + z)^(z*t). We'll write a Python program to search for solutions by enumerating possible values of x, y, z, t within reasonable bounds.

The approach:
1. Iterate x, y, z from 1 to small upper bounds (since exponents grow rapidly)
2. For each (x,y,z), compute both sides of the equation
3. Check if left side equals right side for some t
4. Print valid solutions immediately when found

```python
def solve():
    max_x = 5
    max_y = 5
    max_z = 5
    
    for x in range(1, max_x + 1):
        for y in range(1, max_y + 1):
            left = 20**x + 14**(2*y)
            for z in range(1, max_z + 1):
                base = x + 2*y + z
                if base == 1:  # 1^t is always 1
                    continue
                # Find t such that base^(z*t) == left
                power = 1
                current = base
                while current < left:
                    current *= base
                    power += 1
                if current == left:
                    if power % z == 0:
                        t = power // z
                        print(f"Solution found: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, t={t}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()
```
