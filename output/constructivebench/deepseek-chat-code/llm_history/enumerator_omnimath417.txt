[write_program]
This problem asks to find x⁴ + y⁴ given that x*y = 5 and x² + y² = 21. We can solve this algebraically by using the identity:
(x² + y²)² = x⁴ + y⁴ + 2x²y²
=> x⁴ + y⁴ = (x² + y²)² - 2(xy)²

The Python program will verify this by computing the value using the given constraints.

```python
def main():
    # Given conditions
    xy = 5
    x2_plus_y2 = 21
    
    # Calculate x⁴ + y⁴ using the identity
    x4_plus_y4 = x2_plus_y2**2 - 2 * (xy**2)
    
    # Output the result
    print(f"x⁴ + y⁴ = {x4_plus_y4}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
