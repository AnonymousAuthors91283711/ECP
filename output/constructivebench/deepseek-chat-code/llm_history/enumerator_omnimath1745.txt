The problem asks for the cardinality of the set of non-zero integer pairs (c,d) where there exists an integer x such that c*x = d and d*x = c. We need to find all such pairs (c,d) where c,d ≠ 0.

Key observations:
1. From c*x = d and d*x = c, we can substitute to get c*(x^2) = c
2. Since c ≠ 0, this simplifies to x^2 = 1, so x = 1 or x = -1
3. Case 1: x=1 ⇒ c = d ⇒ all pairs (k,k) where k ≠ 0
4. Case 2: x=-1 ⇒ c = -d ⇒ all pairs (k,-k) where k ≠ 0

The solution counts all such pairs, which form two infinite families. However, the problem likely expects the answer in terms of cardinality types (finite, countably infinite, etc.), but since it's phrased as a natural number, we'll enumerate small examples to see the pattern.

```python
def find_pairs(max_abs=5):
    """Find all non-zero (c,d) pairs up to given absolute value where c*x=d and d*x=c has integer solution"""
    pairs = set()
    for x in [-1, 1]:  # Only possible x values
        for c in range(-max_abs, max_abs + 1):
            if c == 0:
                continue
            d = c * x
            if d != 0 and abs(d) <= max_abs:
                pairs.add((c, d))
    
    # Print found pairs and count
    print("Found pairs:", sorted(pairs))
    print("Count:", len(pairs))

# Run with small parameter to observe pattern
find_pairs(5)
```
