This problem is about solving a simple linear equation. The equation is 3x + 4 = x + 2, and we need to find the value of x that satisfies it. The solution can be found by rearranging the equation algebraically.

We'll write a Python program that:
1. Solves the equation symbolically (though Python isn't great at symbolic math, we can implement the steps)
2. Verifies the solution by plugging it back into the equation
3. Outputs the exact solution as a fraction

```python
# Solving the equation 3x + 4 = x + 2
# Rearranged steps:
# 3x - x = 2 - 4
# 2x = -2
# x = -1

# The exact solution is x = -1
solution = -1

# Verify the solution
left_side = 3 * solution + 4
right_side = solution + 2
print(f"Solution: x = {solution}")
print(f"Verification: 3*({solution}) + 4 = {left_side}, {solution} + 2 = {right_side}")
print(f"Equation holds: {left_side == right_side}")
```
