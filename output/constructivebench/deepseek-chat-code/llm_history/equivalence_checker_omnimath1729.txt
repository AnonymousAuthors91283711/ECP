Ground Truth Answer: 12
Proposed Answer: 2016
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence a(n) with a(0)=√2, a(1)=2, and a(n+1)=a(n)*a(n-1)².

2. We're looking for the smallest positive period p where ⌊a(m)⌋ mod 2014 = ⌊a(m+p)⌋ mod 2014 for all sufficiently large m.

3. The ground truth answer is 12, which suggests the sequence's floor values modulo 2014 have a period of 12 when m is large enough.

4. The proposed answer is 2016, which is exactly 2014+2. This seems suspicious because:
   - It's much larger than the ground truth
   - It's not obviously related to the sequence's behavior
   - 2016 is a multiple of 12 (2016=12×168), but not the minimal period

The proposed answer 2016 is indeed a period (since any multiple of the minimal period is a period), but it's not the least period as required by the problem. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
