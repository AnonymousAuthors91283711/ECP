theorem P2003AMCB_18 :
  IsLeast {x : ℕ | 0 < x ∧ ∃ y : ℕ, 0 < y ∧ 7 * x^5 = 11 * y^13} P2003AMCB_18_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No solution found in search range. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the problem statement and the fact that no solution was found in the enumerated search range, I conjecture that there might be no natural number solution satisfying the given equation. The equation 7x^5 = 11y^13 is a Diophantine equation, and it's possible that no positive integer solutions exist due to the mismatch between the exponents and coefficients.
