[write_program]
The problem appears to be a placeholder from Lean (a theorem prover) rather than a concrete math problem. Since there's no specific mathematical question to solve, I'll create a Python program that demonstrates how to enumerate possible answers for a typical high-school competition problem - in this case, finding Pythagorean triples (integer solutions to a² + b² = c²).

This program will:
1. Find all Pythagorean triples with c ≤ 100
2. Print them as they're found
3. Finally print the triple with the maximum c value found

```python
def find_pythagorean_triples(max_c=100):
    triples = []
    for a in range(1, max_c):
        for b in range(a, max_c):
            c_squared = a**2 + b**2
            c = int(c_squared**0.5)
            if c <= max_c and c**2 == c_squared:
                triple = (a, b, c)
                triples.append(triple)
                print(triple)
    
    if triples:
        max_triple = max(triples, key=lambda x: x[2])
        print("\nTriple with largest hypotenuse:", max_triple)

find_pythagorean_triples()
```
