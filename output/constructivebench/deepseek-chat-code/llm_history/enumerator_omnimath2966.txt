[write_program]
The problem asks to count numbers between 100 and 300 (inclusive) that are divisible by both 5 and 7 but not divisible by 10. We'll write a Python program to enumerate and count these numbers.

Key observations:
1. Numbers divisible by both 5 and 7 must be divisible by LCM(5,7)=35
2. We need to exclude numbers divisible by 10 (i.e., divisible by both 2 and 5)
3. So we count multiples of 35 between 100-300, then subtract those that are also multiples of 70 (LCM of 35 and 2)

```python
def count_numbers():
    count = 0
    # Print each qualifying number as we find it
    for n in range(100, 301):
        if n % 35 == 0 and n % 10 != 0:
            print(n)
            count += 1
    # After enumeration, print the total count
    print("Total count:", count)

count_numbers()
```
