theorem IMO2023SLA4 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hpos : ∀ x > 0, f x > 0) :
  (∀ x > 0, ∀ y > 0, x * (f x + f y) ≥ (f (f x) + y) * f y) ↔ 
  ∃ c > 0, f = fun x => c * IMO2023SLA4_answer x := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing constant functions:

Testing linear functions:

Testing power functions:

Testing combined forms:. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
Based on the functional inequality and the pattern of common solutions to such problems, the most likely solution is a linear function. The enumerated answers suggest a simple linear form. The condition requires a multiplicative constant c > 0.
