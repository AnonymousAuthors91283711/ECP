theorem omnimath2152 :

Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 2), (12, 17), (17, 12)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b) | ∃ k : ℕ, (a = fib (2 * k + 1) ∧ b = fib (2 * k + 2)) ∨ (a = fib (2 * k + 2) ∧ b = fib (2 * k + 1))}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all pairs of positive integers (a,b) where:
   - (2a+1) divides (3b-1)
   - (2b+1) divides (3a-1)

2. Ground truth provides specific solutions: (2,2), (12,17), (17,12)

3. Proposed answer suggests solutions are Fibonacci number pairs where one is an odd-indexed Fibonacci and the other is the next even-indexed Fibonacci (or vice versa)

Let's test the ground truth solutions against the proposed pattern:
- (2,2): fib(3)=2, fib(4)=3 → Doesn't match (2,2)
- (12,17): fib(7)=13, fib(8)=21 → Doesn't match (12,17)
- (17,12): Same issue as above

The proposed answer fails to capture the actual solutions given in the ground truth. The Fibonacci pairs don't satisfy the original divisibility conditions for these cases.
