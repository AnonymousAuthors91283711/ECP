[write_program]
This problem involves computing an infinite series sum S = Î£ (n+1)/z^(n+1) where z = 1 - 2i. We'll write a Python program to approximate this sum numerically by computing partial sums until convergence is observed.

The approach:
1. Compute z = 1 - 2i
2. Compute partial sums of the series up to N terms
3. Stop when the difference between consecutive partial sums is below a small threshold
4. Print each partial sum to observe convergence

```python
import cmath

def compute_series():
    z = 1 - 2j  # Complex number 1 - 2i
    threshold = 1e-10  # Convergence threshold
    prev_sum = 0
    current_sum = 0
    
    for n in range(0, 1000):  # Upper limit to prevent infinite loops
        term = (n + 1) / (z ** (n + 1))
        current_sum += term
        
        # Print every 50 terms to show progress
        if n % 50 == 0:
            print(f"After {n+1} terms: {current_sum}")
            
        # Check for convergence
        if abs(current_sum - prev_sum) < threshold:
            print(f"Converged after {n+1} terms")
            print(f"Final sum: {current_sum}")
            break
            
        prev_sum = current_sum

if __name__ == "__main__":
    compute_series()
```
