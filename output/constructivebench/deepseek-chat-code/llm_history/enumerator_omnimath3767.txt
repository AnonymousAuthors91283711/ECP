The problem asks whether there exist rational numbers p, q, r such that p+q+r=0 and p*q*r=1. We need to enumerate possible rational triples (p, q, r) that satisfy both conditions to find if any exist.

The approach is to:
1. Express r in terms of p and q using p+q+r=0 (r = -p-q)
2. Substitute into the second equation to get p*q*(-p-q)=1
3. Search for small integer numerators/denominators that satisfy this equation

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def find_rational_triples(max_denominator=5):
    found = False
    # Iterate through possible denominators
    for d in range(1, max_denominator + 1):
        # Iterate through possible numerators for p and q
        for p_num in range(-2*d, 2*d + 1):
            for q_num in range(-2*d, 2*d + 1):
                p = Fraction(p_num, d)
                q = Fraction(q_num, d)
                if q == 0:
                    continue
                # Calculate r from p+q+r=0
                r = -p - q
                # Check p*q*r == 1
                if p * q * r == 1:
                    print(f"Found solution: p={p}, q={q}, r={r}")
                    found = True
    if not found:
        print("No solutions found with denominator up to", max_denominator)

find_rational_triples()
```
