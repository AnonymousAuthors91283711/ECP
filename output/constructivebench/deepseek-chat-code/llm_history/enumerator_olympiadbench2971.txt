[write_program]
This problem asks for the largest 5-digit number (between 10000 and 99999) that has all distinct digits and is divisible by 63. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all candidates meeting these criteria and identify the maximum one.

The approach:
1. Iterate numbers from 99999 down to 10000
2. Check divisibility by 63 (since 63 = 7Ã—9, we could optimize by checking divisibility by 9 first)
3. Verify all digits are distinct
4. Track the maximum valid number found

```python
def has_distinct_digits(n):
    s = str(n)
    return len(s) == len(set(s))

max_num = 0
# Iterate from largest to smallest to find maximum faster
for n in range(99999, 9999, -1):
    if n % 63 == 0 and has_distinct_digits(n):
        print(n)  # Stream partial results
        if n > max_num:
            max_num = n
# After full enumeration, output the maximum
print("Maximum valid number:", max_num)
```
