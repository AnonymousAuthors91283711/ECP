This problem involves finding the least root (excluding -n) of the quadratic equation x^2 + (m+n)x + mn = 0, where m=7 and n=8. The roots can be found using the quadratic formula. We'll enumerate possible rational roots to verify the solution.

```python
def find_roots():
    m = 7
    n = 8
    # Coefficients of quadratic equation: x^2 + (m+n)x + mn
    a = 1
    b = m + n
    c = m * n
    
    # Calculate discriminant
    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
    
    # Calculate roots using quadratic formula
    root1 = (-b + discriminant**0.5) / (2*a)
    root2 = (-b - discriminant**0.5) / (2*a)
    
    # Return roots sorted (smallest first)
    roots = sorted([root1, root2])
    
    # Filter out -n (which is -8) and return the smallest remaining
    for root in roots:
        if not (abs(root - (-n)) < 1e-9):  # Check if root is approximately -n
            print(root)
            return

find_roots()
```

The program calculates both roots of the quadratic equation and prints the smallest one that isn't -8. The output will be -7, which is the correct answer (the other root is -8 which we exclude). The solution matches the expected result where T = 7/8 is the ratio between the two roots (-7/-8).
