theorem P2009AMCA_1
(h m : ℕ)
(hm : 0 < m ∧ m < 60)
(hflight : (h * 60 + m) = (1 * 60 + 18) - (10 * 60 + 34))
: (h + m = P2009AMCA_1_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 25. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the problem statement and the enumerated answer, we can see that:
1. The equation represents a time calculation (1:18 minus 10:34)
2. The result should be h + m = 25
3. The calculation would yield -9 hours and -16 minutes, which when normalized to positive time would be 14 hours and 44 minutes (14 + 44 = 58, but this doesn't match the answer)
4. The enumerated answer suggests the absolute value of the sum is taken (|-9 + -16| = 25)
