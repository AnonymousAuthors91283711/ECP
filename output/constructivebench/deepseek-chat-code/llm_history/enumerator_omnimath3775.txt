[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest number n such that for any subset of n squares on an 8×8 chessboard, there must exist at least one square (i,j) in the subset where neither i is in any 4 given rows nor j is in any 4 given columns. We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of n and check the condition.

The approach will be:
1. Generate all possible combinations of 4 rows and 4 columns
2. For each candidate n, check if every subset of size n must intersect the complement of some row/column combination
3. Start from small n and increase until we find the minimal n satisfying the condition

```python
from itertools import combinations

def solve():
    size = 8
    threshold = 4
    # Generate all possible row and column combinations
    all_rows = list(combinations(range(size), threshold))
    all_cols = list(combinations(range(size), threshold))
    
    # We'll test n from 33 downward since the answer is likely in this range
    for n in range(33, 0, -1):
        valid = True
        # For each possible combination of rows and columns
        for rows in all_rows:
            for cols in all_cols:
                # The forbidden area is rows × cols (size 4×4=16)
                # The allowed area is (8×8) - (rows×all + all×cols - rows×cols)
                # Which equals (8×8 - 8×4 - 8×4 + 4×4) = 64 - 32 - 32 + 16 = 16
                # So maximum allowed is 16, meaning n must be >16 to guarantee hitting forbidden
                # But we need to find minimal n where any n-sized subset must hit the complement
                max_allowed = (size - threshold) * (size - threshold)
                if n > max_allowed:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            print(f"Possible candidate: {n}")
        else:
            print(f"n = {n} is too small")
            # The first n where the condition holds is our answer
            print(f"Minimal n satisfying condition: {n+1}")
            return

solve()
```
