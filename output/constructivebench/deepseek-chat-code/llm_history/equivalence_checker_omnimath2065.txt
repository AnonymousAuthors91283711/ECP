Ground Truth Answer: 60
Proposed Answer: 15
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal sum a+b+c+d where:
   - All numbers a,b,c,d are positive integers
   - gcd(a,c)=1 and gcd(b,d)=1
   - gcd(a,b)≠1, gcd(b,c)≠1, gcd(c,d)≠1, gcd(d,a)≠1

2. The ground truth answer is 60, which comes from the minimal solution (6,10,15,29):
   - gcd(6,15)=3≠1, gcd(10,15)=5≠1, etc.
   - gcd(6,29)=1 (satisfies gcd(a,c)=1)
   - gcd(10,29)=1 (satisfies gcd(b,d)=1)
   - Sum: 6+10+15+29=60

3. The proposed answer is 15, which is too small because:
   - The smallest possible sum with all numbers ≥1 would be 1+1+1+1=4
   - But we need gcd(a,b)≠1, etc., so at least two numbers must share a factor
   - Even the smallest possible valid configuration would sum to more than 15
