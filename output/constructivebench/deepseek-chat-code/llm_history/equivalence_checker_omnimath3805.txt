Ground Truth Answer: {0, (1 - ·), (·) - 1}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∀ x, f x = 0} ∪ {f | ∃ c, (∀ x, f x = x - c) ∧ c = 1} ∪ {f | ∃ c, (∀ x, f x = -x + c) ∧ c = 1}
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground Truth: {0, (1 - ·), (·) - 1}
- This represents three specific functions:
  1. The zero function (f(x) = 0)
  2. The function f(x) = 1 - x
  3. The function f(x) = x - 1

Proposed Answer: 
1. {f | ∀ x, f x = 0} - This matches the zero function in ground truth
2. {f | ∃ c, (∀ x, f x = x - c) ∧ c = 1} - This gives f(x) = x - 1 (matches ground truth)
3. {f | ∃ c, (∀ x, f x = -x + c) ∧ c = 1} - This gives f(x) = -x + 1 = 1 - x (matches ground truth)

The proposed answer covers all three cases from the ground truth, though expressed in a more verbose form. The key points are:
- Both include the zero function
- Both include the linear functions with slope 1 and -1, intercept 1
- No additional functions are included in the proposed answer
