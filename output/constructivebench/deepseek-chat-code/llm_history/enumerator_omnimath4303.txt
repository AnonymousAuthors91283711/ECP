[write_program]
This problem asks to determine if there are no integer solutions (k, n) to the equation k^3 = 3n^2 + 3n + 7. We'll write a Python program to search for integer solutions within a reasonable range.

The approach is:
1. Iterate over possible n values (both positive and negative)
2. For each n, compute the right-hand side (3nÂ² + 3n + 7)
3. Check if the result is a perfect cube
4. If found, print the solution (k, n)

We'll search within a range where cubes are likely to match the RHS values.

```python
def find_solutions():
    max_n = 1000  # Reasonable search range
    for n in range(-max_n, max_n + 1):
        rhs = 3 * n * n + 3 * n + 7
        if rhs < 0:
            continue  # k^3 must be positive
        k = round(rhs ** (1/3))
        # Check nearby integers due to floating point rounding
        for delta in [-1, 0, 1]:
            test_k = k + delta
            if test_k ** 3 == rhs:
                print(f"Solution found: k={test_k}, n={n}")
                return
    print("No solutions found in the searched range")

find_solutions()
```
