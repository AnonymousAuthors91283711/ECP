This problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that there are at least T=5 integers k>0 satisfying -k²-2k+n ≥ 0. We need to find this minimal n for T=5.

The approach is to:
1. For each n starting from 1, count how many positive integers k satisfy n ≥ k²+2k
2. Find the first n where this count reaches 5

We'll implement this by:
- Iterating n from 1 upwards
- For each n, count valid k by solving the quadratic inequality
- Stop when we find the first n with count ≥ 5

```python
def count_valid_ks(n):
    """Count positive integers k where k^2 + 2k <= n"""
    count = 0
    k = 1
    while True:
        val = k*k + 2*k
        if val > n:
            break
        count += 1
        k += 1
    return count

def find_min_n(T=5):
    """Find minimal n with at least T valid k values"""
    n = 1
    while True:
        cnt = count_valid_ks(n)
        if cnt >= T:
            print(f"n={n} has {cnt} valid k values")
            if cnt == T:  # Minimal n found
                print(f"Minimal n for T={T} is {n}")
                break
        n += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_n()
```
