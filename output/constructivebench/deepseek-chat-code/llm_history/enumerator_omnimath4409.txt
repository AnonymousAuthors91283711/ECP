[write_program]
This problem asks to find all real numbers x such that 3x³ - floor(x) = 3. We'll write a Python program to search for solutions in different intervals where floor(x) remains constant.

The approach is:
1. For each integer n (floor value), solve 3x³ - n = 3 in the interval [n, n+1)
2. Check if the solution falls within the interval
3. Print valid solutions as they are found

```python
import math

def find_solutions():
    # Search for solutions in a reasonable range of floor values
    for n in range(-10, 10):
        # Equation becomes 3x^3 = 3 + n => x^3 = (3 + n)/3
        rhs = (3 + n) / 3
        if rhs < 0:
            continue  # Skip negative RHS since we want real solutions
        x = rhs ** (1/3)
        # Check if x is in [n, n+1)
        if n <= x < n + 1:
            print(f"Solution found: x ≈ {x:.6f} (floor(x) = {n})")

    # Also check negative floor values
    for n in range(-10, 0):
        rhs = (3 + n) / 3
        if rhs >= 0:  # Only consider cases where x^3 is non-negative
            x = rhs ** (1/3)
            if n <= x < n + 1:
                print(f"Solution found: x ≈ {x:.6f} (floor(x) = {n})")

find_solutions()
```
