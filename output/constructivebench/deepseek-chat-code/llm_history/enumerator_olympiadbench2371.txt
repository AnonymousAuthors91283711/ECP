This problem involves finding the function g given that g(f(x)) = 4x² + 1 where f(x) = 2x + 1. We can approach this by finding the inverse of f and substituting into the given equation.

The inverse function f⁻¹(y) can be found by solving y = 2x + 1 for x, giving x = (y - 1)/2. Then g(y) = g(f(f⁻¹(y))) = 4(f⁻¹(y))² + 1 = 4((y-1)/2)² + 1 = (y-1)² + 1.

Here's a Python program that verifies this solution by testing it with sample values:

```python
def f(x):
    return 2 * x + 1

def g(y):
    return (y - 1)**2 + 1

# Test the relationship g(f(x)) == 4x² + 1 for sample values
test_values = [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]

print("Testing g(f(x)) == 4x² + 1 for sample x values:")
for x in test_values:
    lhs = g(f(x))
    rhs = 4 * x**2 + 1
    print(f"x = {x}: g(f(x)) = {lhs}, 4x²+1 = {rhs}, {'Match' if lhs == rhs else 'Mismatch'}")
```
