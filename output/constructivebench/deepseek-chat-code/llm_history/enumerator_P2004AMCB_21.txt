This problem asks for the sum of the maximum and minimum values of y/x for positive real numbers (x,y) satisfying the equation 2x² + xy + 3y² - 11x - 20y + 40 = 0. We'll approach this by:

1. Parameterizing y = kx (since we're interested in y/x ratios)
2. Substituting into the equation to get a quadratic in x
3. Ensuring real solutions exist (discriminant ≥ 0)
4. Finding the range of k where positive solutions exist
5. Calculating the sum of the extreme k values

```python
import math

def find_ratio_bounds():
    # We'll search for k where the discriminant is non-negative
    # and there exist positive x solutions
    min_k = None
    max_k = None
    
    # The equation after substitution y = kx:
    # (2 + k + 3k²)x² + (-11 - 20k)x + 40 = 0
    # For real solutions, discriminant must be ≥ 0:
    # D = B² - 4AC ≥ 0 where:
    # A = 3k² + k + 2
    # B = -20k -11
    # C = 40
    
    # First find where discriminant is zero
    # D = (20k+11)² - 4*(3k²+k+2)*40 = 0
    # Expand and simplify:
    # 400k² + 440k + 121 - 480k² - 160k - 320 = 0
    # -80k² + 280k - 199 = 0
    # 80k² - 280k + 199 = 0
    
    # Solve this quadratic for k
    a = 80
    b = -280
    c = 199
    discriminant = b*b - 4*a*c
    k1 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant))/(2*a)
    k2 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant))/(2*a)
    
    # Verify these are the bounds by checking discriminant inside [k1,k2]
    test_k = (k1 + k2)/2
    A = 3*test_k**2 + test_k + 2
    B = -20*test_k -11
    D = B*B - 4*A*40
    if D > 0:
        # The interval is valid
        min_k = k1
        max_k = k2
    else:
        # The valid k's are outside [k1,k2]
        # But our original analysis shows it's inside
        pass
    
    print(f"Minimum ratio y/x: {min_k}")
    print(f"Maximum ratio y/x: {max_k}")
    print(f"Sum of ratios: {min_k + max_k}")
