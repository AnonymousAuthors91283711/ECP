[write_program]
This problem involves calculating the probability that a randomly chosen point (x,y) in the unit square [0,1]×[0,1] remains in the unit square after being transformed by T(x,y) = (3x+2y, x+4y). We need to find this probability as a reduced fraction a/b and compute 100a + b.

The approach is to:
1. Find the inverse transformation T⁻¹
2. Determine the region where T⁻¹ maps points back into the unit square
3. Calculate the area of this region (which gives the probability since unit square area=1)
4. Express as reduced fraction a/b and compute 100a + b

def calculate_probability():
    # The inverse transformation T⁻¹(u,v) = ( (4u - 2v)/10, (-u + 3v)/10 )
    # We need to find all (u,v) in [0,1]×[0,1] such that T⁻¹(u,v) is in [0,1]×[0,1]
    
    # The conditions become:
    # 0 ≤ (4u - 2v)/10 ≤ 1
    # 0 ≤ (-u + 3v)/10 ≤ 1
    # Which simplifies to:
    # 0 ≤ 4u - 2v ≤ 10
    # 0 ≤ -u + 3v ≤ 10
    
    # Within the unit square, we can find the boundary lines:
    # v = 2u (from 4u - 2v = 0)
    # v = 2u - 5 (from 4u - 2v = 10)
    # v = u/3 (from -u + 3v = 0)
    # v = (u + 10)/3 (from -u + 3v = 10)
    
    # The region is a polygon with vertices at intersections of these lines and unit square boundaries
    vertices = [
        (0, 0),         # origin
        (0.5, 0),       # intersection of v=0 and v=u/3
        (0.6, 0.2),     # intersection of v=2u and v=(u+10)/3
        (0, 1/3),       # intersection of u=0 and v=(u+10)/3
        (0, 0)          # back to origin
    ]
    
    # Calculate area using shoelace formula
    area = 0
    n = len(vertices)
    for i in range(n):
        x_i, y_i = vertices[i]
        x_j, y_j = vertices[(i+1)%n]
        area += (x_i * y_j) - (x_j * y_i)
    area = abs(area) / 2
    
    # Convert to fraction
    frac = fractions.Fraction(area).limit_denominator()
    a, b = frac.numerator, frac.denominator
    
    # Output intermediate results
    print(f"Area: {area}")
    print(f"Fraction: {a}/{b}")
    print(f"100a + b: {100*a + b}")
