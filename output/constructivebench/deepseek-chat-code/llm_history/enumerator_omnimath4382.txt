This problem asks to find all natural numbers n for which any function assigning positive integers to n cards satisfies: if for every pair of cards i,j there exists a non-empty subset S of cards whose geometric mean equals the arithmetic mean of i and j, then all cards must have the same value.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate small values of n where this property holds. The key insight is that for n=1 it's trivially true, and for n=2 it's true by taking S={i,j}. For larger n, we need to check if the condition forces all cards to be equal.

```python
def test_property(n):
    from itertools import product
    
    # Try small card values up to 3 since higher values unlikely to affect the property
    max_card = 3
    for cards in product(range(1, max_card+1), repeat=n):
        all_pairs_satisfy = True
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                found = False
                # Check all non-empty subsets S
                for mask in range(1, 1 << n):
                    S = [k for k in range(n) if (mask >> k) & 1]
                    if not S:
                        continue
                    # Compute arithmetic mean
                    am = (cards[i] + cards[j]) / 2
                    # Compute geometric mean
                    product = 1.0
                    for k in S:
                        product *= cards[k]
                    gm = product ** (1.0/len(S))
                    # Check if approximately equal
                    if abs(am - gm) < 1e-9:
                        found = True
                        break
                if not found:
                    all_pairs_satisfy = False
                    break
            if not all_pairs_satisfy:
                break
        
        # If property holds but not all cards equal
        if all_pairs_satisfy and len(set(cards)) > 1:
            return False
    return True

# Test small values of n
for n in range(1, 6):
    if test_property(n):
        print(f"Property holds for n = {n}")
    else:
        print(f"Property fails for n = {n}")
```

The program checks the property for n from 1 to 5 by enumerating all possible card assignments with values 1-3. For each n, it verifies whether the condition implies all cards must be equal. The output shows for which small n values the property holds.
