[write_program]
This problem is about finding the maximum possible value k for a graph coloring problem where:
1. Each edge of a complete graph Kn is colored with a positive integer
2. All edge colors are distinct
3. Each edge's color is the smallest positive integer not appearing on any adjacent edges (edges sharing a common vertex)

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible k values for small n (starting from n=5) to help conjecture the pattern.

```python
def edge_adjacent(e1, e2):
    """Check if two edges share exactly one vertex"""
    return len(set(e1) & set(e2)) == 1

def is_valid_coloring(edges, coloring):
    """Verify all conditions of the problem"""
    colors = set(coloring.values())
    # All colors positive and distinct
    if len(colors) != len(coloring) or min(colors) < 1:
        return False
    # Each color is minimal for its edge
    for e in edges:
        adjacent_colors = set()
        for e2 in edges:
            if e != e2 and edge_adjacent(e, e2):
                adjacent_colors.add(coloring[e2])
        m = 1
        while m in adjacent_colors:
            m += 1
        if coloring[e] != m:
            return False
    return True

def max_k(n):
    """Find maximum k for complete graph Kn"""
    vertices = list(range(n))
    edges = [(i,j) for i in vertices for j in vertices if i < j]
    
    from itertools import permutations
    
    max_found = 0
    # Try all possible colorings with k up to edge count
    for k in range(1, len(edges)+1):
        found = False
        # Try all permutations of k distinct colors
        for colors in permutations(range(1, k+1), len(edges)):
            coloring = dict(zip(edges, colors))
            if is_valid_coloring(edges, coloring):
                max_found = max(max_found, max(colors))
                found = True
                print(f"n={n}, valid coloring with max color {max(colors)}")
                break
        if not found:
            break
    return max_found

# Test small cases
for n in range(5, 8):
    print(f"\nTesting n={n}")
    k = max_k(n)
    print(f"Maximum k for n={n}: {k}")
```
