theorem omnimath3821
: (∀ f : ℝ → ℝ, (∀ x y : ℝ, f x * f y - f (x - 1) - f (y + 1) = f (x * y) + 2 * x - 2 * y - 4) ↔ f ∈ omnimath3821_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing linear functions f(x) = a*x + b:

Testing quadratic functions f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c:
Found candidate: f(x) = 1x^2 + 0x + 1

Thorough verification of f(x) = x + 2:
Function f(x) = x + 2 verified: False. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
<<<{f | ∀ x, f x = x^2 + 1}>>>
