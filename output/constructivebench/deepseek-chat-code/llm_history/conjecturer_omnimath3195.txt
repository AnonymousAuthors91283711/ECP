theorem omnimath3195 :
  ∃ (c : ℕ), 5 ≤ c ∧ c ≤ 10 ∧
    ∃ (k : ℕ), (c - 1) * k + (k + 1) = 100 ∧
    k + 1 = omnimath3195_answer ∧
    ∀ (c' : ℕ) (k' : ℕ), 5 ≤ c' ∧ c' ≤ 10 →
      (c' - 1) * k' + (k' + 1) = 100 →
      k' + 1 = omnimath3195_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found solution: c=9, k=11, k+1=12
All solutions yield k+1 = 12. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<12>>>
