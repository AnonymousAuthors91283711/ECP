[write_program]
This problem asks for the number of real numbers x in the interval (-19, 98) that satisfy the equation cos²x + 2sin²x = 1. We'll write a Python program to count these solutions by:

1. Simplifying the equation to sin²x = 0 (since cos²x + 2sin²x = 1 → (1-sin²x) + 2sin²x = 1 → sin²x = 0)
2. Finding all integer multiples of π within (-19, 98)
3. Counting these solutions

```python
import math

def count_solutions():
    lower_bound = -19
    upper_bound = 98
    count = 0
    
    # Find the smallest integer n where n*pi > lower_bound
    n_start = math.floor(lower_bound / math.pi) + 1
    
    # Find the largest integer n where n*pi < upper_bound
    n_end = math.ceil(upper_bound / math.pi) - 1
    
    # Count all integer n from n_start to n_end inclusive
    count = max(0, n_end - n_start + 1)
    
    print(f"Number of solutions in (-19, 98): {count}")

count_solutions()
```
