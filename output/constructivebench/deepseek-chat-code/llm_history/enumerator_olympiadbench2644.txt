[write_program]
This problem involves calculating the sum of squared sine values for specific angles. The angles are given by π*(4 + 4*k)/180 radians for k from 0 to 43, which corresponds to 4°, 8°, 12°, ..., 176° (since 4 + 4*43 = 176). 

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Calculate each term sin²(π*(4 + 4*k)/180)
2. Sum them up
3. Output both the individual terms and the final sum

The key observation is that sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2, which might help simplify the sum mathematically, but we'll compute it numerically first to observe the pattern.

```python
import math

def compute_sum():
    total = 0.0
    for k in range(44):
        angle_deg = 4 + 4 * k
        angle_rad = math.pi * angle_deg / 180
        term = math.sin(angle_rad) ** 2
        total += term
        # Print each term with 10 decimal places for precision
        print(f"k={k}: angle={angle_deg}°, term={term:.10f}")
    print("\nFinal sum:", total)

compute_sum()
```
