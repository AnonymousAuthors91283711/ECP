This problem asks for the last 8 digits of the product (11 × 101 × 1001 × 10001 × 100001 × 1000001 × 111) modulo 10^8. We'll compute this directly in Python by calculating the product modulo 10^8 at each step to prevent integer overflow and maintain efficiency.

```python
def compute_product_mod():
    numbers = [11, 101, 1001, 10001, 100001, 1000001, 111]
    mod = 10**8
    result = 1
    for num in numbers:
        result = (result * num) % mod
    print(result)

compute_product_mod()
```
