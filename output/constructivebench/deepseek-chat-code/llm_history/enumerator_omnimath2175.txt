[write_program]
The problem is to find the sum of all positive integers `n` such that:
1. After applying the operation `m -> m - minFac(m)` exactly 2022 times, the result is prime.
2. After applying the same operation 2021 times, the result is not prime.
3. All intermediate values must remain positive.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate such numbers `n` for smaller iteration counts first to understand the pattern, then generalize. The operation `m -> m - minFac(m)` essentially subtracts the smallest prime factor at each step.

```python
import math

def min_fac(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return 2
    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
    return n

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return n == 2
    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def check_condition(n, k):
    for _ in range(k):
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        n -= min_fac(n)
    return is_prime(n)

def find_numbers(iterations):
    results = []
    # We'll limit our search to reasonable numbers for demonstration
    max_n = 10000
    for n in range(2, max_n + 1):
        if check_condition(n, iterations) and not check_condition(n, iterations - 1):
            results.append(n)
            print(f"Found candidate: {n}")
    print(f"Sum for {iterations} iterations: {sum(results)}")
    return results

# Test with smaller iteration counts first to observe patterns
for k in [3, 4, 5]:
    print(f"\nTesting with {k} iterations:")
    find_numbers(k)
```

This program:
1. Defines helper functions to find smallest prime factor and check primality
2. Implements the iteration operation and condition checking
3. Tests with smaller iteration counts (3,4,5) to observe patterns
4. Prints each candidate number found and the final sum
5. Limits search to n â‰¤ 10000 for demonstration purposes

The output will show numbers satisfying the condition for smaller iteration counts, helping identify the pattern that likely holds for 2022 iterations. The actual solution would involve recognizing this pattern and deriving the general formula.
