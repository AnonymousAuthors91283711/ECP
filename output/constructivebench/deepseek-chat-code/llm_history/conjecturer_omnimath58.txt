Found so
Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: Prop
From the enumerated solutions, we can observe that all natural numbers n ≥ 1 satisfy the proposition. Since the output was cut off but showed solutions for n=1 through n=87 (and likely continues), the pattern suggests the proposition holds for all natural numbers.
