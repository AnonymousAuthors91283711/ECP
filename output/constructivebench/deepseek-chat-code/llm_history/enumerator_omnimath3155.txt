[write_program]
This problem involves counting sets of numbers with specific properties. We need to enumerate possible answers for small values of n to help conjecture the pattern. The key is to count sets S ⊆ {1,...,n} where for any two elements a,b ∈ S with (a+b) even, their average (a+b)/2 must also be in S.

We'll write a Python program to:
1. Generate all subsets of {1,...,n}
2. Check the mediocre condition
3. Count valid sets for n up to a threshold
4. Compute the difference A(n+2)-2A(n+1)+A(n) and check when it equals 1

```python
def is_mediocre(S):
    """Check if set S satisfies the mediocre condition"""
    elements = sorted(S)
    for i in range(len(elements)):
        a = elements[i]
        for j in range(i, len(elements)):
            b = elements[j]
            if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
                avg = (a + b) // 2
                if avg not in S:
                    return False
    return True

def count_mediocre_sets(n):
    """Count all mediocre subsets of {1,...,n}"""
    from itertools import combinations
    count = 0
    for k in range(n + 1):
        for subset in combinations(range(1, n + 1), k):
            if is_mediocre(subset):
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    max_n = 8  # Reasonable threshold for demonstration
    A = [0] * (max_n + 3)  # A[0] to A[max_n+2]
    
    print("n | A(n) | A(n+2)-2A(n+1)+A(n)")
    print("-----------------------------")
    for n in range(max_n + 1):
        A[n] = count_mediocre_sets(n)
        if n >= 2:
            diff = A[n] - 2 * A[n-1] + A[n-2]
            print(f"{n-2} | {A[n-2]} | {diff}")
            if diff == 1:
                print(f"Found n = {n-2} where difference equals 1")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The program computes the sequence A(n) and checks the difference condition for n up to 8. The output shows n, A(n), and the difference A(n+2)-2A(n+1)+A(n). When the difference equals 1, it prints the corresponding n value. This helps identify the pattern without revealing the final answer.
