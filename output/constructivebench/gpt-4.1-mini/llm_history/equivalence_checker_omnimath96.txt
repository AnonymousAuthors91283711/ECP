Ground Truth Answer: {0, id}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℤ, ∀ x : ℤ, f x = c * x}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for all integer-valued functions f: ℤ → ℤ that satisfy a particular functional equation involving quadratic forms.

2. The ground truth answer gives two solutions: the zero function (f(x) = 0) and the identity function (f(x) = x).

3. The proposed answer suggests that all linear functions f(x) = c*x (for any constant c ∈ ℤ) satisfy the equation.

Analysis:
- The zero function is included in both answers (when c=0).
- The identity function is included in the proposed answer (when c=1).
- However, the proposed answer claims that ALL linear functions work, which is not true. For example, f(x) = 2x does not satisfy the original equation (you can verify this by plugging in a=1, b=0, c=0).

Therefore, the proposed answer is too broad and includes incorrect solutions. The ground truth answer is precisely correct.
