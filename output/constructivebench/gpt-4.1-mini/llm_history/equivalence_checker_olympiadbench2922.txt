Ground Truth Answer: 24
Proposed Answer: 20
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us:
   - A² + R² = 20
   - M² + L² = 10
   - All variables are positive integers
   - Asks for the value of A*R*M*L

2. For positive integers:
   - The only possible pairs for (M,L) are (1,3) and (3,1) since 1² + 3² = 10
   - For (A,R), possible pairs are (2,4) and (4,2) since 2² + 4² = 20

3. Calculating A*R*M*L:
   - For (2,4,1,3): 2*4*1*3 = 24
   - For (2,4,3,1): 2*4*3*1 = 24
   - For (4,2,1,3): 4*2*1*3 = 24
   - For (4,2,3,1): 4*2*3*1 = 24

The ground truth answer is consistently 24 in all cases, while the proposed answer is 20. These are not equivalent.
