Ground Truth Answer: Real.exp (Real.exp 1) - 1
Proposed Answer: (∑' n : ℕ, (∑ f : Fin n → Fin n, if ∀ x, f (f x) = f x then 1 else 0) / (Nat.factorial n))

The proposed answer is structurally similar to the ground truth answer but not exactly equivalent. The ground truth answer gives a closed-form solution (e^e - 1), while the proposed answer expresses the solution as a series involving counting idempotent functions. The proposed answer is mathematically correct in terms of expressing the count of idempotent functions, but it's not simplified to the closed-form solution given in the ground truth. Therefore, it's "Close" but not exactly equivalent.
