The error occurs because the proposed answer `a + 18` uses the variable `a` which is not in scope at the point where the abbreviation `omnimath2723_answer` is defined. Since `a` is a parameter to the theorem, to produce a closed-form answer independent of parameters we must express `d` solely in terms of constants.

From the conditions:  
- \(a + b + c + d = 120\)  
- \(b = a + 6\), \(c = b + 6 = a + 12\), \(d = c + 6 = a + 18\)  

Substituting \(b, c, d\) in the sum:  
\[a + (a+6) + (a+12) + (a+18) = 4a + 36 = 120 \implies 4a = 84 \implies a = 21.\]  

Then:  
\[d = a + 18 = 21 + 18 = 39.\]

Hence the fixed closed-form answer is 39, which is an explicit natural number constant.

<<<39>>>
