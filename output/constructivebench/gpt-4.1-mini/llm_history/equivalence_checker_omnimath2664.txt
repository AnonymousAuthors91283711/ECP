Ground Truth Answer: 4180
Proposed Answer: 2^(2*6) + 2^(2*3) + 2^(2*2) + 2^(2*1)
Let's analyze this step by step:

1. The problem defines pairs [(1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1)] and asks to compute the sum of 2^(2*y) for each (x,y) pair.

2. The ground truth answer is 4180.

3. The proposed answer is the explicit sum: 2^(2*6) + 2^(2*3) + 2^(2*2) + 2^(2*1)

Calculating the proposed answer:
2^(12) + 2^6 + 2^4 + 2^2 = 4096 + 64 + 16 + 4 = 4180

This exactly matches the ground truth answer. The proposed answer is just the expanded form of the calculation that leads to 4180.
