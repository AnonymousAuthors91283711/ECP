Ground Truth Answer: 23
Proposed Answer: 21
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives a family of quadratic polynomials fₙ(x) = x² + (2n-1)x + (n²-22) and asks for which natural number n > 0 the polynomial has no real roots (i.e., is always positive or always negative).

2. For a quadratic ax² + bx + c to have no real roots, the discriminant must be negative: b² - 4ac < 0.

3. Calculating the discriminant:
   (2n-1)² - 4(1)(n²-22) = 4n² - 4n + 1 - 4n² + 88 = -4n + 89 < 0
   → -4n + 89 < 0 → 4n > 89 → n > 22.25

4. Since n must be a natural number, the smallest n satisfying this is n = 23.

The ground truth answer (23) is correct, while the proposed answer (21) is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the inequality (21 > 22.25 is false).
