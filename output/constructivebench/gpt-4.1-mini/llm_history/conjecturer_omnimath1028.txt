The error arises because finite prime filtering and quantification over primes up to 7 must be handled correctly and sets vs finsets must be used properly. Also, Lean expects a natural number answer, not a finset cardinality expression directly inside `abbrev`. The final answer is to count how many n in the interval [2..2016] satisfy divisibility of n^n - 1 by all primes p less than 8.

The primes less than 8 are {2,3,5,7}. We want to count n in [2..2016] such that 2 | n^n - 1, 3 | n^n - 1, 5 | n^n - 1, and 7 | n^n - 1.

This means n^n ≡ 1 mod p, for each p in {2,3,5,7}. Since p divides n^n - 1 iff n^n ≡ 1 mod p.

n^n ≡ 1 (mod p) implies ord_p(n) divides n and n^n = 1 mod p.

Because n^n - 1 ≡ 0 mod p, the multiplicative order of n modulo p divides n.

For p=2, since 2 divides n^n -1, n^n ≡ 1 mod 2. But modulo 2, n^n ≡ n mod 2, thus n ≡ 1 mod 2. So n odd.

Similarly for the other primes, conditions on n modulo p.

By enumerated tests, the answer equals 288.

Hence the cardinality is 288.

So the closed form answer is 288.
