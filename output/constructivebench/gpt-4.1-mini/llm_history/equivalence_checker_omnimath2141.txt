Ground Truth Answer: 7 + (13 * π) / 3
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze this problem carefully:

1. The problem is about calculating the average number of integer-coordinate cubes (p,q,r) where a unit sphere centered at (x,y,z) intersects the cube (p,p+1)×(q,q+1)×(r,r+1), averaged over all (x,y,z) in the unit cube [0,1]³.

2. The ground truth answer is 7 + (13π)/3 ≈ 20.61, which makes sense because:
   - A unit sphere has diameter 2, so it can intersect up to 8 cubes (the center cube plus its 26 neighbors, but only those within distance 1)
   - However, the average is less than 8 because when the sphere is near the center of the unit cube, it doesn't reach all 8 possible neighboring cubes
   - The π term comes from spherical caps when the sphere is near the boundary

3. The proposed answer is simply 8, which would be the maximum possible number of cubes a unit sphere could intersect, but not the average over all positions in the unit cube.

The proposed answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the varying number of cubes intersected when the sphere is near the boundary versus the center.
