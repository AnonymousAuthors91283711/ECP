Ground Truth Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ C : ℝ, (∀ x : ℝ, f x = C) ∨ (∀ x : ℝ, f x = x + C) ∨ (∀ x : ℝ, f x = -x + C) ∨ (∀ x : ℝ, f x = x^3 + C) ∨ (∀ x : ℝ, f x = -x^3 + C)}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ (A B C : ℝ), ∀ x, f x = A * x^3 + B * x + C}
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground truth lists five possible forms:
1. Constant functions (f(x) = C)
2. Linear functions (f(x) = x + C)
3. Negative linear functions (f(x) = -x + C)
4. Cubic functions (f(x) = x³ + C)
5. Negative cubic functions (f(x) = -x³ + C)

The proposed answer gives a general cubic form: f(x) = A*x³ + B*x + C

The equivalence:
1. Constant functions: A=0, B=0 in proposed
2. Linear functions: A=0, B=1 in proposed
3. Negative linear: A=0, B=-1 in proposed
4. Cubic: A=1, B=0 in proposed
5. Negative cubic: A=-1, B=0 in proposed

However, the proposed answer is more general as it allows arbitrary combinations of A and B, while the ground truth only allows specific cases where either A or B is zero, or where they have magnitude 1. For example, f(x) = 2x³ + 3x + C would be in the proposed answer but not in the ground truth.
