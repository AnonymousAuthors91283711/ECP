theorem omnimath645 : 
  let total := Nat.choose 8 2 * Nat.choose 6 2 * Nat.choose 4 2 * Nat.choose 2 2 / 24
  let valid := Nat.choose 4 2 * Nat.choose 2 2 / 2 * Nat.choose 4 2 * Nat.choose 2 2 / 2
  (valid : ℚ) / (total : ℚ) = omnimath645_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 3 / 35
Proposed Answer: ( (Nat.choose 4 2 * Nat.choose 2 2 / 2) * (Nat.choose 4 2 * Nat.choose 2 2 / 2) : ℚ) / (Nat.choose 8 2 * Nat.choose 6 2 * Nat.choose 4 2 * Nat.choose 2 2 / 24 : ℚ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating a probability ratio of valid configurations to total configurations.

2. The ground truth answer is 3/35.

3. The proposed answer is exactly the same as the expression given in the theorem statement, just with parentheses added for clarity.

4. Calculating the proposed answer:
   - Nat.choose 4 2 = 6
   - Nat.choose 2 2 = 1
   - So numerator becomes (6 * 1 / 2) * (6 * 1 / 2) = 3 * 3 = 9
   - Denominator:
     - Nat.choose 8 2 = 28
     - Nat.choose 6 2 = 15
     - Nat.choose 4 2 = 6
     - Nat.choose 2 2 = 1
     - So denominator is 28*15*6*1/24 = 2520/24 = 105
   - Final fraction: 9/105 = 3/35 (after simplifying by dividing numerator and denominator by 3)

The proposed answer simplifies to exactly the same as the ground truth answer.
