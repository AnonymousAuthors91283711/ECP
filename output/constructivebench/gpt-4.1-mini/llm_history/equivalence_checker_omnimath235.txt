Ground Truth Answer: {n | n ≡ 0 [MOD 8] ∨ n ≡ 3 [MOD 8]}
Proposed Answer: { n | n > 0 ∧ (3 * n * (3 * n - 1)) / 2 - (n * (n - 1) / 2 + 2 * n * n) = (7 / 5) * (n * (n - 1) / 2 + 2 * n * n) }

The proposed answer correctly captures the mathematical relationship described in the problem (the equation relating boys_matches and girls_matches), but it doesn't simplify the condition to the modular arithmetic form given in the ground truth answer. The ground truth answer provides a more elegant and simplified characterization of the solution set. Both answers would yield the same solutions, but the forms are different in presentation and level of simplification.
