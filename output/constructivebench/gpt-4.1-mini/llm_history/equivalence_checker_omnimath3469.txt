open Real

abbrev omnimath3469_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3469 (x y z : ℝ) 
  (h1 : x = 0.2 * y) 
  (h2 : x = 0.5 * z) : 
  z = (omnimath3469_answer / 100) * y := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 40
Proposed Answer: 10
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. From h1: x = 0.2*y
2. From h2: x = 0.5*z
3. Setting them equal: 0.2*y = 0.5*z
4. Solving for z: z = (0.2/0.5)*y = 0.4*y
5. The theorem states z = (answer/100)*y
6. So 0.4*y = (answer/100)*y ⇒ answer = 40

The ground truth answer is 40, which correctly follows from the equations. The proposed answer is 10, which would make z = 0.1*y, but this contradicts the given equations (which require z = 0.4*y).
