Ground Truth Answer: fun n => if Even n then n / (n + 2) else 1
Proposed Answer: fun n => (n + 1) / (n + 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the value of a polynomial P at n+1, given its values at integers from 0 to n.

2. The ground truth answer gives a piecewise function based on whether n is even or odd.

3. The proposed answer gives a simpler expression (n+1)/(n+2) for all n.

Let's test some small values:
- For n=0 (even): 
  Ground truth: 0/(0+2) = 0
  Proposed: (0+1)/(0+2) = 1/2
  Different results

- For n=1 (odd):
  Ground truth: 1
  Proposed: (1+1)/(1+2) = 2/3
  Different results

- For n=2 (even):
  Ground truth: 2/4 = 1/2
  Proposed: 3/4
  Different results

The answers consistently give different results for all tested values of n, both even and odd. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
