theorem olympiadbench2552 : 
  (2 : ℚ)/5 + 5/2 + 1/(2*5) = olympiadbench2552_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 41/10
Let's evaluate the proposed answer step by step:

1. Calculate each term:
   - 2/5 = 0.4
   - 5/2 = 2.5
   - 1/(2*5) = 1/10 = 0.1

2. Sum them up:
   0.4 + 2.5 + 0.1 = 3.0

The ground truth answer is 3, which equals 3.0 in decimal form.

The proposed answer is 41/10, which equals 4.1 in decimal form.

These are clearly different results (3.0 ≠ 4.1).
