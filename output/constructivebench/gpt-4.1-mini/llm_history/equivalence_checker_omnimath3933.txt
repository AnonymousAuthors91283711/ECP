Ground Truth Answer: {f | f = (fun _ => 0) ∨ ∃ a, f = fun x => x^2 + a}
Proposed Answer: { f | ∃ c : ℝ, (f = fun x => c * x) ∧ (c = 0 ∨ c = 1 ∨ c = -1) }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The functional equation given is: f(f x - f y) = f(f x + f y) - 4 * f x * f y

2. Ground truth answer suggests solutions are either:
   - The zero function (f(x) = 0)
   - Quadratic functions shifted vertically (f(x) = x² + a)

3. Proposed answer suggests solutions are:
   - The zero function (f(x) = 0)
   - Linear functions with slope 1 or -1 (f(x) = x or f(x) = -x)

Testing the proposed solutions:
- For f(x) = 0: Both sides become 0, so it works
- For f(x) = x: LHS = x - y, RHS = x + y - 4xy → Doesn't work
- For f(x) = -x: Similar issue as above
- For f(x) = x² + a: 
  LHS = (x² - y²)² + a
  RHS = (x² + y²)² + a - 4x²y² - 4a(x² + y²) + 4a²
  After simplification, LHS = RHS only when a=0

The proposed answer misses the quadratic solutions (except when a=0) and incorrectly includes linear solutions that don't satisfy the equation.
