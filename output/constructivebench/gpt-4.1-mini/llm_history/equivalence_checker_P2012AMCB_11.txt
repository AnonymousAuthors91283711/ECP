Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find natural numbers A and B where:
   - B = A + 1
   - B² + 2B + 3 = A² + 2A + 3
   - And we want the minimal sum A + B that satisfies these conditions

2. Simplifying the equation:
   B² + 2B = A² + 2A
   (A+1)² + 2(A+1) = A² + 2A
   A² + 2A + 1 + 2A + 2 = A² + 2A
   4A + 3 = 2A
   2A = -3
   A = -1.5

3. However, A must be a natural number (ℕ), so there's no solution in natural numbers. But the ground truth claims 13 and proposed answer claims 9, both of which are incorrect since no natural number solution exists.

4. The problem might have been miscopied or there might be a typo in the equation. As stated, neither answer is correct.
