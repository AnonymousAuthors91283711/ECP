Ground Truth Answer: 30
Proposed Answer: 12
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the least non-negative real number t that satisfies the equation:
   5*(t/60) - 3*(t/60) = 1

2. Simplifying the equation:
   (5-3)*(t/60) = 1
   2*(t/60) = 1
   t/60 = 1/2
   t = 60*(1/2) = 30

3. The ground truth answer is indeed 30, which matches our calculation.

4. The proposed answer is 12, which doesn't satisfy the equation:
   5*(12/60) - 3*(12/60) = 5*0.2 - 3*0.2 = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4 ≠ 1

<<<False>>>
