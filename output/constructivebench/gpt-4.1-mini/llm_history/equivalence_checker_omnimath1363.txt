Ground Truth Answer: 1005
Proposed Answer: 2010
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the greatest number k where:
   - There exists a real polynomial p(x) of degree at least 2010
   - p(x) has no real roots (∀x:ℝ, p(x)≠0)
   - All coefficients from degree 0 to 2010 are either -1 or 1
   - The coefficient of x²⁰¹⁰ is 1
   - k counts how many coefficients from degrees 0 to 2009 are -1

2. The ground truth answer is 1005, which suggests that the maximum number of -1 coefficients is about half of the possible coefficients (2010 total coefficients from 0 to 2009).

3. The proposed answer is 2010, which would mean all coefficients from 0 to 2009 could be -1 while still satisfying all conditions.

4. However, having all coefficients negative (-1) with a positive leading coefficient (1 for x²⁰¹⁰) would likely create a polynomial that crosses zero somewhere (since for large negative x, the polynomial would tend to -∞, and for large positive x it would tend to +∞), violating the "no real roots" condition.

5. The ground truth answer of 1005 makes more sense as it represents a balanced distribution of -1 and 1 coefficients that could potentially avoid real roots.
