Ground Truth Answer: 26
Proposed Answer: 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find integer solutions (x,y) to the system:
   - 2x² + 8y = 26
   - x - y = k (where k is the answer we're evaluating)

2. The ground truth answer is 26, meaning it claims there exists integers x,y such that:
   - 2x² + 8y = 26
   - x - y = 26

3. The proposed answer is 2, meaning it claims there exists integers x,y such that:
   - 2x² + 8y = 26
   - x - y = 2

Let's check if the proposed answer is correct by solving for x,y when k=2:

From x - y = 2, we get y = x - 2
Substitute into first equation:
2x² + 8(x-2) = 26
2x² + 8x - 16 = 26
2x² + 8x - 42 = 0
x² + 4x - 21 = 0
Solutions: x = (-4 ± √(16+84))/2 = (-4 ± 10)/2
So x = 3 or x = -7

Corresponding y values:
If x=3, y=1
If x=-7, y=-9

Both pairs (3,1) and (-7,-9) satisfy both original equations when k=2.

The ground truth answer 26 would require:
y = x - 26
Substituting:
2x² + 8(x-26) = 26
2x² + 8x - 208 = 26
2x² + 8x - 234 = 0
x² + 4x - 117 = 0
Solutions: x = (-4 ± √(16+468))/2 = (-4 ± √484)/2 = (-4 ± 22)/2
So x = 9 or x = -13

Corresponding y values:
If x=9, y=-17
If x=-13, y=-39

Both pairs (9,-17) and (-13,-39) also satisfy the equations when k=26.

Both answers are correct as they both provide valid solutions to the problem. The problem asks for "∃ x y" (there exists), and both k=2 and k=26 satisfy this.
