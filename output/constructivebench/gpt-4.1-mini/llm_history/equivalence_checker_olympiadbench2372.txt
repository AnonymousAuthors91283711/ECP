Ground Truth Answer: 5
Proposed Answer: 14
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a geometric sequence where:
   - The sum of first 2 terms is 40
   - The sum of first 3 terms is 76
   - The sum of first 4 terms is 130
   - It follows the geometric sequence property for n > 0

2. We can solve for the initial term and ratio:
   - From h1: g₀ + g₁ = 40
   - From h2: g₂ = 36 ⇒ g₁ * r = 36
   - From h3: g₃ = 54 ⇒ g₂ * r = 54 ⇒ r = 1.5
   - Then g₁ = 36/1.5 = 24
   - And g₀ = 40 - 24 = 16

3. The sequence is: 16, 24, 36, 54, 81, 121.5, ...
   - We're looking for terms <20 that are integers
   - Only n=0 (16), n=1 (24) exceed 20
   - All higher terms grow larger
   - Actually, only n=0 (16) is <20 and integer

Wait, this contradicts both answers. Let me re-examine:

The question asks for {n | n < 20 ∧ geometric n is integer}:
- g₀ = 16 (integer)
- g₁ = 24 (integer)
- g₂ = 36 (integer)
- g₃ = 54 (integer)
- g₄ = 81 (integer)
- g₅ = 121.5 (not integer)
- Higher terms either non-integer or >20

So there are exactly 5 terms (n=0 to 4) satisfying the condition.

The ground truth answer (5) is correct, while the proposed answer (14) is incorrect.
