Ground Truth Answer: {3}
Proposed Answer: {n | n = 3}
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The ground truth answer {3} and the proposed answer {n | n = 3} are mathematically equivalent. Both expressions define the set containing exactly the natural number 3. The first is an explicit enumeration of the set's elements, while the second uses set-builder notation to describe the same set. Therefore, the answers are equivalent.
