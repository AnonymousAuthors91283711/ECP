Ground Truth Answer: 738826
Proposed Answer: (8 * factorial 9 / 4 + 4 * factorial 7 / 2 + 4 * factorial 6 + 4 * factorial 4 + factorial 3 + factorial 2 + factorial 2 : ℕ)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a complex factorial expression that needs to be evaluated.
2. The ground truth answer is given as 738826.
3. The proposed answer is essentially the same expression as in the problem statement, just with some parentheses added and the (2*2) simplified to 4 in the first term.

Now let's verify if the proposed answer would evaluate to the ground truth:

- The expression is identical in both form and operation order
- The simplification from (2*2) to 4 is mathematically correct
- All other terms remain unchanged
- The type annotation (: ℕ) at the end doesn't affect the value

Since the proposed answer is just a syntactic variation of the original problem statement (which we know evaluates to 738826), they must be equivalent.
