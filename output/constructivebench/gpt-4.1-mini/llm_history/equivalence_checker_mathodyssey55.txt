Ground Truth Answer: 35
Proposed Answer: 441
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two quadratic functions f and g in the form x² + ax + b and x² + cx + d respectively.
2. We know g(6) = 35.
3. We have two ratio conditions: f(-1)/g(-1) = 21/20 and f(1)/g(1) = 21/20.
4. The ground truth answer claims f(6) = 35.
5. The proposed answer claims f(6) = 441.

Analysis:
- The ratio conditions suggest that f(x) = (21/20)g(x) for x = -1 and x = 1.
- For quadratic functions, if they agree at three points, they must be identical. Here we have agreement at two points, but the ratio is the same.
- This suggests f(x) = (21/20)g(x) for all x, since two points plus the quadratic form enforce this proportionality.
- Therefore, f(6) = (21/20)g(6) = (21/20)*35 = 36.75, not 35 or 441.
- Both the ground truth and proposed answers are incorrect based on this reasoning.
