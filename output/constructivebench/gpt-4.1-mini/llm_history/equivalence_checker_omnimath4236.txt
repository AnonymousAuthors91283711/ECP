Ground Truth Answer: fun c => c * (c^2 / 4)
Proposed Answer: fun c => c * (c - 3) / 2
Let me analyze the problem and compare the answers.

The problem is about finding the maximum number of possible "games" (represented by home/away pairs) under certain constraints for an even number c ≥ 4. 

The ground truth answer is c * (c² / 4), which simplifies to c³/4.

The proposed answer is c * (c - 3) / 2, which simplifies to (c² - 3c)/2.

Let's test with c=4:
- Ground truth: 4 * (4²/4) = 16
- Proposed: 4 * (4-3)/2 = 2

These give very different results (16 vs 2), and for c=6:
- Ground truth: 6 * (6²/4) = 54
- Proposed: 6 * (6-3)/2 = 9

The answers are clearly not equivalent, and the proposed answer gives much smaller values than the ground truth.
