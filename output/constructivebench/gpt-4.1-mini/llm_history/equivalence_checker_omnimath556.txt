Ground Truth Answer: 416 / 729
Proposed Answer: (2/3) * ((2/3) * ((2/3) + (1/3) * (2/3)) + (1/3) * (2/3) * ((2/3) + (1/3) * (2/3)))
Let's evaluate the proposed answer step by step:

1. First calculate (2/3) + (1/3)*(2/3):
   (1/3)*(2/3) = 2/9
   (2/3) + (2/9) = 8/9

2. Now the expression becomes:
   (2/3) * ((2/3)*(8/9) + (1/3)*(2/3)*(8/9))

3. Calculate (2/3)*(8/9) = 16/27
   (1/3)*(2/3)*(8/9) = 16/81

4. Now we have:
   (2/3) * (16/27 + 16/81) = (2/3) * (48/81 + 16/81) = (2/3) * (64/81) = 128/243

Now let's convert the ground truth answer 416/729 to have denominator 243:
416/729 = (416*3)/(729*3) = 1248/2187 = 128/243 (simplified)

Both answers simplify to 128/243, so they are equivalent.
