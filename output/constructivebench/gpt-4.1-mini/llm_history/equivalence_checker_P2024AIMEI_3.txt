Ground Truth Answer: 809
Proposed Answer: (2025 / 5) * 2
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem asks for the count of numbers from 0 to 2024 (Finset.range 2025) that are either ≡ 0 mod 5 or ≡ 2 mod 5.

2. The proposed answer is (2025 / 5) * 2 = 405 * 2 = 810.

3. The ground truth answer is 809.

Analysis:
- There are exactly 405 complete cycles of 5 in 2025 numbers (since 2025/5 = 405).
- In each complete cycle of 5 numbers, exactly 2 numbers meet the condition (0 and 2 mod 5).
- However, the last number 2024 ≡ 4 mod 5, so it doesn't affect the count.
- The calculation should be 405 * 2 = 810, but we need to check the endpoint:
  - The range includes 0 (≡0) and 2024 (≡4)
  - So the count should indeed be 405 * 2 = 810

But the ground truth says 809, which suggests there might be an off-by-one error in either the ground truth or the proposed answer. However, mathematically, the proposed calculation is correct.
