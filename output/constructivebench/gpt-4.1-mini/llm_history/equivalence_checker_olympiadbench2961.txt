Ground Truth Answer: 335
Proposed Answer: 6 * 7^2 + 5 * 7 + 6
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is \(6 \times 7^2 + 5 \times 7 + 6\), which simplifies to \(6 \times 49 + 35 + 6 = 294 + 35 + 6 = 335\). This matches the ground truth answer of 335. The problem asks for the greatest number in the set \(\{n : \mathbb{N} | \exists (A B : \text{Fin } 7), A \neq B \land n = A \times 7^2 + B \times 7 + A\}\). The proposed answer satisfies \(A = 6\) and \(B = 5\) (both in \(\text{Fin } 7\) and \(A \neq B\)), and the calculation yields the correct maximum value. Thus, the answers are equivalent.
