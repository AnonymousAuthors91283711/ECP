Ground Truth Answer: {p | let (a, b) := p; |a| = |b|}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b) | a = 0 ∧ b = 0}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for all pairs (a, b) where there exist functions f, g: ℤ → ℤ such that:
   - f(g(x)) = x + a for all x
   - g(f(x)) = x + b for all x

2. The ground truth answer states that |a| must equal |b|. This makes sense because:
   - The conditions imply that f and g are bijections
   - The compositions f∘g and g∘f are translations by a and b respectively
   - For these to be consistent, the translation amounts must be equal in magnitude

3. The proposed answer only includes (0, 0), which is indeed a solution (with f = g = id), but it's too restrictive. There are many other solutions where |a| = |b| ≠ 0.

The proposed answer is a proper subset of the correct solution, missing all cases where a and b are non-zero but equal in magnitude.
