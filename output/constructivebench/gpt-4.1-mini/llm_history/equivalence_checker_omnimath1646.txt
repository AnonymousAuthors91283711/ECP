Ground Truth Answer: {2, 5, 13}
Proposed Answer: { n : ℕ | ∃ a b : ℕ, a^2 + b^2 = n ∧ Nat.Coprime a b ∧ ∀ p : ℕ, p.Prime → p ≤ Real.sqrt n → p ∣ a * b }

The proposed answer is a set comprehension that correctly captures the logical conditions specified in the problem statement. However, it's not simplified to the explicit enumeration {2, 5, 13} that the ground truth provides. The proposed answer is mathematically equivalent in terms of defining the same set, but not in the same explicit form. Therefore, it's "Close" since it's correct but not in the exact same format.
