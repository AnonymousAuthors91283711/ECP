Ground Truth Answer: {5}
Proposed Answer: {p : ℕ | Nat.Prime p ∧ ∃ q r : ℕ, Nat.Prime q ∧ Nat.Prime r ∧ p^2 = 3 + q * 10^(List.length (Nat.digits 10 r)) + r}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is close to the ground truth answer but not exactly equivalent. The ground truth answer is the singleton set {5}, which is correct because 5 is the only prime satisfying the given condition. The proposed answer uses a different expression for combining q and r (q * 10^(length of digits of r) + r) instead of the ofDigits function used in the problem statement. While these expressions are mathematically equivalent for natural numbers q and r, the proposed answer's formulation is more verbose and less direct than the ground truth. However, both would yield the same result {5} when evaluated.
