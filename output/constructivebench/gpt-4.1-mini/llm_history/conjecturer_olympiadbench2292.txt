The error comes from using the symbol ± directly in Lean, which is not a valid Lean syntax. Instead, we should use logical Or and explicit enumeration of the pairs, writing out all four possibilities that fit the pattern.

The equation is K² + 3 L² = 41 - 20 = 21. The candidate solutions correspond to (±1,0) and (0,±2), which satisfy 1² + 3*0² = 1 and 0 + 3*2²=12, so these don't satisfy 21. We should verify what is the correct constant value:

5² + 4² - 5*4 = 25 + 16 - 20 = 21

Therefore, the equation is K² + 3 L² = 21.

Find integer solutions to this:

Try (±3, ±2):

3² + 3*2² = 9 + 12 = 21

So the solutions must be (±3, ±2) and (±3, ∓2):

So the set is all (K, L) such that K=±3 and L=±2.

Therefore,

olympiadbench2292_answer := {(K,L) | (K = 3 ∧ L = 2) ∨ (K = 3 ∧ L = -2) ∨ (K = -3 ∧ L = 2) ∨ (K = -3 ∧ L = -2)}

We write this in Lean syntax explicitly.

<<<{(K, L) | (K = 3 ∧ L = 2) ∨ (K = 3 ∧ L = -2) ∨ (K = -3 ∧ L = 2) ∨ (K = -3 ∧ L = -2)}>>>
