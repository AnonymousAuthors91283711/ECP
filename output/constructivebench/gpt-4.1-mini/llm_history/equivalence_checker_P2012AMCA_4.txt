Ground Truth Answer: 4 / 7
Proposed Answer: 3 / 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. From the problem, we have:
   - b = 3*(b+r)/5
   - r = (b+r) - b = r (this is just an identity)
   - newb = b
   - newr = 2*r
   - newtotal = newb + newr = b + 2r

2. Solving the first equation b = 3*(b+r)/5:
   5b = 3b + 3r => 2b = 3r => b = (3/2)r

3. Now calculate newr/newtotal:
   newr/newtotal = 2r/(b + 2r) = 2r/((3/2)r + 2r) = 2r/((7/2)r) = 4/7

The ground truth answer is 4/7, while the proposed answer is 3/7. The calculation clearly shows the correct answer is 4/7, so the proposed answer is incorrect.
