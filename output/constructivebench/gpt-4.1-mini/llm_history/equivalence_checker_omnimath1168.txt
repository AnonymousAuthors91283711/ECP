Ground Truth Answer: 4002
Proposed Answer: (2 * 2002 - 4 : ℚ) + ((2002 - 4 : ℚ) * (1/2)^(2001 : ℕ))
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive function f(n) where:
   - f(2) = 2
   - f(n+3) = (n+3) + (1/2)*f(n+2) for n ≥ 0

2. We're asked to evaluate f(2002)

3. The ground truth answer is 4002

4. The proposed answer is (2*2002 - 4) + ((2002 - 4)*(1/2)^2001)

Let's simplify the proposed answer:
- 2*2002 - 4 = 4004 - 4 = 4000
- (2002 - 4)*(1/2)^2001 = 1998*(1/2)^2001 ≈ 0 (extremely small)
- So proposed answer ≈ 4000 + negligible term ≈ 4000

But the ground truth is 4002, which is different from 4000.

The proposed answer seems to be following a pattern but is off by 2. The correct closed form should be 2n - 2 (which gives 4002 for n=2002), not 2n - 4.
