The error comes from using the set-builder notation `{(p, p - 1, p) | p : ℕ // ... }` which is not valid in Lean. The correct way to write such a set with a predicate on p is to use `Set.image` or `SetOf` with an appropriate predicate, or to use `SetOf` over the triples `(a,b,p)` satisfying the given condition.

Since the problem describes the solution set as triples `(a,b,p)` where `a = p`, `b = p - 1`, and `p` is prime with `p ≥ 2`, we can define it as a `Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)` in Lean as follows:

```lean
{ (a,b,p) | Nat.Prime p ∧ 2 ≤ p ∧ a = p ∧ b = p - 1 }
```

This is a set of triples with conditions explicitly. This syntax is accepted in Lean.

So the fixed expression is:

<<<{ (a, b, p) | Nat.Prime p ∧ 2 ≤ p ∧ a = p ∧ b = p - 1 }>>>

Explanation:

- Used correct set notation `{ ... }` in Lean with triple `(a,b,p)`
- Added explicit variable bindings `(a,b,p)` and predicate on these variables
- Included constraints that `p` is prime and `p ≥ 2`
- Enforced `a = p` and `b = p - 1`, matching the enumerated answer pattern but correct syntax

This is a closed form describing the answer set in Lean without error.
