abbrev P2009AMCA_7_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem P2009AMCA_7 (x n : ℕ) (hx : 3 * x - 8 ≠ 0) :
  (5 * x - 11) - (2 * x - 3) = (3 * x + 1) - (5 * x - 11) ∧
  2 * x - 3 + (n - 1) * (3 * x - 8) = 2009 ↔
  n = P2009AMCA_7_answer x := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => (2009 - (2 * x - 3)) / (3 * x - 8) + 1
Proposed Answer: fun x => if 3 * x - 8 = 0 then 0 else (2009 - (2 * x - 3)) / (3 * x - 8) + 1
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but includes an unnecessary case for `3 * x - 8 = 0` which is already excluded by the hypothesis `hx` in the theorem. The ground truth answer correctly omits this case since it's already handled by the theorem's precondition. The core mathematical expression is identical in both answers.
