Ground Truth Answer: 108
Proposed Answer: (27 : ℝ)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two equations:
   - e/f = 3/4
   - √(e² + f²) = 15
   And asks us to find e*f

2. From the first equation, we can express e in terms of f: e = (3/4)f

3. Substituting into the second equation:
   √((9/16)f² + f²) = 15 → √((25/16)f²) = 15 → (5/4)|f| = 15 → |f| = 12 → f = 12 or f = -12

4. Then e = (3/4)*12 = 9 or e = (3/4)*(-12) = -9

5. In both cases, e*f = 9*12 = 108 or (-9)*(-12) = 108

The ground truth answer is 108, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 27, which is incorrect as it's exactly 1/4 of the correct answer.
