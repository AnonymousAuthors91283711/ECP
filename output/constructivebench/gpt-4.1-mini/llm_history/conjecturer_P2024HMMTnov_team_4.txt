theorem P2024HMMTnov_team_4 :
  ∑ n in (Finset.range 111).map (Function.Embedding.mk (fun k => 9 * (k + 1)) (by simp [Function.Injective])),
    (digits 10 n).sum = P2024HMMTnov_team_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Explanation: The numbers considered are 9, 18, ..., 9*111 = 999. Each is a multiple of 9, less than 1000. The digits sums of multiples of 9 from 9 to 999 are such that the sum over all is 9 * (1+2+...+111) = 9 * 111 * 112 / 2.

Final Answer:
<<<9 * 111 * 112 / 2>>>
