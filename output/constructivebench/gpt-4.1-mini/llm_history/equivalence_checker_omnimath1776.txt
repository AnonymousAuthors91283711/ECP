theorem omnimath1776 (x : ℂ) :

Ground Truth Answer: { -1, I, -I }
Proposed Answer: {x : ℂ | x ^ 5 = -1 ∧ x ≠ -1}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the roots of the polynomial x⁴ + 2x³ + 2x² + 2x + 1 = 0 in ℂ.

2. Ground truth gives the explicit roots: {-1, i, -i}

3. Proposed answer gives {x : ℂ | x⁵ = -1 ∧ x ≠ -1}

Analysis:
- The polynomial can be factored as (x+1)(x³+x²+x+1) = 0
- This gives root x = -1 and roots of x³+x²+x+1 = 0
- The cubic can be written as (x⁴-1)/(x-1) = 0 ⇒ x⁴ = 1 (x≠1)
- So roots are x = -1 and primitive 4th roots of unity (i, -i) excluding 1

The proposed answer suggests roots of x⁵ = -1 excluding -1. The roots of x⁵ = -1 are the 5th roots of -1, which are different from the actual roots of our polynomial.

The actual roots should satisfy x⁴ = 1 (for x≠-1), not x⁵ = -1.
