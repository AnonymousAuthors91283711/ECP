theorem omnimath1524 : 
  Nat.card {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ n < 1998 ∧ Nat.Coprime n 1547} = omnimath1524_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1487
Proposed Answer: 1998 - 1998 / 1547
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the count of numbers between 1 and 1997 (0 < n < 1998) that are coprime with 1547.

2. The ground truth answer is 1487.

3. The proposed answer is 1998 - 1998/1547.

Analysis:
- The proposed answer attempts to use the principle that the count of numbers coprime to m in [1,N] is N - N/m, but this is incorrect.
- The correct formula would involve Euler's totient function and would need to account for the prime factorization of 1547 (which is 7×13×17).
- The proposed answer gives a non-integer result (1998 - 1998/1547 ≈ 1996.71), while the correct answer must be integer.
- The correct calculation would be φ(1547) = (7-1)(13-1)(17-1) = 6×12×16 = 1152, then count multiples of this period within the range.

The proposed answer is completely incorrect both in approach and result.
