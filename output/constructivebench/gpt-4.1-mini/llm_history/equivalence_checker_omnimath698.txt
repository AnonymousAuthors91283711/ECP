Ground Truth Answer: Real.sqrt 19
Proposed Answer: 4 * Real.sin (Real.pi / 14) / Real.cos (Real.pi / 7)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

1. The ground truth answer is √19, which is approximately 4.3589
2. The proposed answer is 4*sin(π/14)/cos(π/7). Calculating this:
   - π/14 ≈ 0.2244 radians
   - π/7 ≈ 0.4488 radians
   - sin(π/14) ≈ 0.2225
   - cos(π/7) ≈ 0.9009
   - 4*0.2225/0.9009 ≈ 0.9880

The numerical values are very different (4.3589 vs 0.9880), so they cannot be equivalent expressions.
