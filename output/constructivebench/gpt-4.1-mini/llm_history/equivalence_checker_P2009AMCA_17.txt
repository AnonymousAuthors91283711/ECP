Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two geometric series sums (a/(1-r)) set equal to their respective ratios (r₁ and r₂), with constraints that a > 0, r₁,r₂ > 0, and r₁ ≠ r₂.

2. From hsum₁: a = r₁(1 - r₁)
   From hsum₂: a = r₂(1 - r₂)

3. Setting them equal: r₁(1 - r₁) = r₂(1 - r₂)
   Simplifying: r₁ - r₁² = r₂ - r₂²
   Rearranging: r₁ - r₂ = r₁² - r₂²
   Factoring: r₁ - r₂ = (r₁ - r₂)(r₁ + r₂)

4. Since r₁ ≠ r₂ (hne), we can divide both sides by (r₁ - r₂):
   1 = r₁ + r₂

The ground truth answer is indeed 1, while the proposed answer is 2. These are clearly different.
