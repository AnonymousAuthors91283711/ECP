theorem omnimath4272 (n : ℕ) (hn : n > 0) :
  (∃ m, ∑ d ∈ divisors n, d = 2^m) → omnimath4272_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => ∃ k, n.divisors.card = 2^k
Proposed Answer: fun n => ∃ m, n = 2^m
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is about numbers where the sum of their divisors equals a power of 2 (2^m).

2. The ground truth answer states that such numbers are those where the number of divisors is a power of 2 (2^k).

3. The proposed answer suggests that such numbers must themselves be powers of 2 (n = 2^m).

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- While powers of 2 do satisfy both conditions (sum of divisors is a power of 2 AND number of divisors is a power of 2), there are other numbers where the number of divisors is a power of 2 but the number itself isn't a power of 2 (e.g., products of distinct Fermat primes).

The ground truth answer is more general and correct, while the proposed answer is too restrictive.
