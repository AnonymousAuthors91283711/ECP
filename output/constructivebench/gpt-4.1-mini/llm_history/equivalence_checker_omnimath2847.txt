Ground Truth Answer: 1 / 2
Proposed Answer: 1/7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have four integers A < B < C < D
2. We have two ratio conditions:
   - (B-A)/(C-A) = 1/5
   - (C-B)/(D-C) = 2/1
3. We need to find (B-A)/(D-C)

Let's solve it step by step:

From h₂: (B-A)/(C-A) = 1/5 ⇒ 5(B-A) = C-A ⇒ C = 5B - 4A

From h₃: (C-B)/(D-C) = 2 ⇒ C-B = 2(D-C) ⇒ D = (3C-B)/2

Now compute D-C = (3C-B)/2 - C = (C-B)/2

We need (B-A)/(D-C) = (B-A)/((C-B)/2) = 2(B-A)/(C-B)

From C = 5B-4A, we get C-B = 4B-4A = 4(B-A)

Thus, 2(B-A)/(C-B) = 2(B-A)/4(B-A) = 2/4 = 1/2

The ground truth answer is indeed 1/2, while the proposed answer is 1/7.
