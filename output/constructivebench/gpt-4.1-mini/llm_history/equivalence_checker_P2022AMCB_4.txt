Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the number of distinct integer values k such that the quadratic x² + kx + 36 has two distinct integer roots (r₁ and r₂).

2. For a quadratic to have two distinct integer roots, the following must hold:
   - r₁ * r₂ = 36 (constant term)
   - r₁ + r₂ = -k (coefficient of x)

3. We need to find all pairs of distinct integers (r₁, r₂) whose product is 36, then compute k = -(r₁ + r₂) for each pair.

4. The factor pairs of 36 (considering both positive and negative) are:
   (1,36), (-1,-36)
   (2,18), (-2,-18)
   (3,12), (-3,-12)
   (4,9), (-4,-9)
   (6,6), (-6,-6) [excluded since roots must be distinct]
   and their reverses (36,1), etc.

5. Calculating k for each distinct pair:
   -(1+36) = -37
   -(-1-36) = 37
   -(2+18) = -20
   -(-2-18) = 20
   -(3+12) = -15
   -(-3-12) = 15
   -(4+9) = -13
   -(-4-9) = 13

6. This gives us 8 distinct k values: -37, 37, -20, 20, -15, 15, -13, 13

The ground truth answer is 8, while the proposed answer is 4. The proposed answer is incorrect as it's missing half of the solutions (likely only considering positive roots or positive k values).
