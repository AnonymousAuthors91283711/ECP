Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: 20
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n ≥ 6 where the binomial coefficient C(n,6) equals 6 times C(n,3).

2. The ground truth answer is 13, which is correct because:
   - C(13,6) = 1716
   - C(13,3) = 286
   - 6 * 286 = 1716
   - And no smaller n ≥ 6 satisfies this condition

3. The proposed answer is 20:
   - While C(20,6) = 38760 and C(20,3) = 1140, and 6*1140 = 6840 ≠ 38760
   - This clearly doesn't satisfy the equation
   - Moreover, 20 is not the smallest solution even if it did work

The proposed answer is completely incorrect as it neither satisfies the equation nor is it the minimal solution.
