Ground Truth Answer: 11
Proposed Answer: 6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n > 1 that satisfies a particular binomial probability equation involving combinations and probabilities (1/4 and 3/4).

2. The equation essentially balances two probabilities:
   - Probability of exactly 2 successes in n trials (left side)
   - Probability of exactly 3 successes in n trials (right side)

3. To find the correct answer, we would need to solve:
   C(n,2)*(1/4)^2*(3/4)^(n-2) = C(n,3)*(1/4)^3*(3/4)^(n-3)

4. Simplifying this equation leads to:
   3*C(n,2) = C(n,3)
   which further simplifies to n = 11

5. The ground truth answer is 11, which is correct based on this derivation.

6. The proposed answer is 6, which doesn't satisfy the equation when we test it:
   - For n=6: LHS = 15*(1/16)*(81/256) ≈ 0.297
   - RHS = 20*(1/64)*(27/64) ≈ 0.132
   These are not equal.

<<<False>>>
