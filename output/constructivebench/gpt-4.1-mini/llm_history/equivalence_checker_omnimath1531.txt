Ground Truth Answer: fun _ => -4
Proposed Answer: fun a : ℝ => 3 * a
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the least value of s = x1³ + x2³ + x3³ - 3x1x2x3 where x1, x2, x3 are roots of the cubic equation x³ - a x² + a x - a = 0.

2. The ground truth answer is a constant function -4, meaning the minimal value is always -4 regardless of a.

3. The proposed answer is 3a, which depends linearly on a.

Key observations:
- The expression s = x1³ + x2³ + x3³ - 3x1x2x3 is symmetric in the roots.
- For a cubic equation x³ + px² + qx + r = 0, the sum of cubes of roots minus 3 times their product can be expressed in terms of p, q, r.
- In our case, p = -a, q = a, r = -a.
- The minimal value should be independent of a because the roots' behavior compensates for changes in a.

The proposed answer 3a is clearly different from the constant -4, and incorrect because:
1. It varies with a while the correct answer doesn't
2. For a=1, 3a=3 ≠ -4
3. For a=2, 3a=6 ≠ -4
