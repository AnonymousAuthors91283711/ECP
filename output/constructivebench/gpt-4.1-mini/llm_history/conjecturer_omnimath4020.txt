The issue arises because in Lean, inside a set comprehension like `{(x, y, z) | P}`, the variables `x, y, z` are not implicitly bound; you need to tell Lean explicitly that these come from the type of the set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ), e.g., by pattern matching on the triple. Also, `x > 0` is a proposition and cannot be used as a multiplicand or factor in arithmetic expressions. You must use `fst` and `snd` or destructure the triple.

A standard way is to define the set as the set of triples `(x,y,z)` satisfying the propositions:

- `x > 0 ∧ y > 0 ∧ z > 0`
- `2 * (x + y + z + 2 * x * y * z)^2 = (2 * x * y + 2 * y * z + 2 * z * x + 1)^2 + 2023`

To express this properly, write:

```lean
{p : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ | let (x,y,z) := p in 
  x > 0 ∧ y > 0 ∧ z > 0 ∧
  2 * (x + y + z + 2 * x * y * z)^2 = (2 * x * y + 2 * y * z + 2 * z * x + 1)^2 + 2023 }
```

or equivalently define a predicate and use its preimage.

Thus the corrected Lean expression is:

<<<
{p : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ | 
  let (x, y, z) := p in
  x > 0 ∧ y > 0 ∧ z > 0 ∧
  2 * (x + y + z + 2 * x * y * z)^2 = (2 * x * y + 2 * y * z + 2 * z * x + 1)^2 + 2023 }

The error arises because Lean does not allow the `let ... in` syntax directly in set comprehensions. Instead, you can pattern match in the lambda argument directly. Also, the condition `x > 0 ∧ y > 0 ∧ z > 0` can be expressed with `x ≠ 0` since x, y, z are natural numbers and positivity is strictly greater than zero (since 0 < x means x ≠ 0). 

Here's the corrected answer expression for `omnimath4020_answer`, defining the set of triples satisfying all required conditions:

<<<{ (x, y, z) : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ | x ≠ 0 ∧ y ≠ 0 ∧ z ≠ 0 ∧
