theorem omnimath3032
    (x y : ℝ)
    (hconst : 2 + x = x + y ∧ x + y = y + 5) :
    x - y = omnimath3032_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: -3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. From the given constraints:
   - 2 + x = x + y simplifies to 2 = y
   - x + y = y + 5 simplifies to x = 5

2. Therefore:
   x - y = 5 - 2 = 3

The ground truth answer is correct (3), while the proposed answer is -3, which is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
