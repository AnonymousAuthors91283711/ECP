Ground Truth Answer: 105 / 212
Proposed Answer: 233/610
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence aₙ with:
   - a₀ = 3
   - a₁ = 2
   - aₙ₊₂ = aₙ₊₁ + aₙ (Fibonacci-like recurrence)

2. We need to compute the sum from n=0 to 8 of aₙ/(aₙ₊₁ * aₙ₊₂)

3. First, let's compute the sequence values:
   a₀ = 3
   a₁ = 2
   a₂ = 2+3 = 5
   a₃ = 5+2 = 7
   a₄ = 7+5 = 12
   a₅ = 12+7 = 19
   a₆ = 19+12 = 31
   a₇ = 31+19 = 50
   a₈ = 50+31 = 81
   a₉ = 81+50 = 131
   a₁₀ = 131+81 = 212

4. Now compute the sum:
   Each term can be rewritten as 1/aₙ₊₁ - 1/aₙ₊₂ by partial fractions
   The sum telescopes to 1/a₁ - 1/a₁₀ = 1/2 - 1/212 = (106-1)/212 = 105/212

The ground truth answer (105/212) is correct, while the proposed answer (233/610) is incorrect.
