Ground Truth Answer: 16 / 3
Proposed Answer: 8
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the difference between the supremum and infimum of a set of real numbers c defined by certain conditions involving a and b.

2. The conditions are:
   - a + b = 2 - c
   - a² + b² = 12 - c²

3. We can analyze this using algebra:
   - From (a + b)² = a² + b² + 2ab, we get (2 - c)² = (12 - c²) + 2ab
   - Expanding gives 4 - 4c + c² = 12 - c² + 2ab
   - Simplifying: 2ab = 2c² - 4c - 8
   - So ab = c² - 2c - 4

4. For real a, b to exist, the discriminant must be non-negative:
   - The quadratic in terms of a would be t² - (2 - c)t + (c² - 2c - 4) = 0
   - Discriminant D = (2 - c)² - 4(c² - 2c - 4) ≥ 0
   - D = 4 - 4c + c² - 4c² + 8c + 16 = -3c² + 4c + 20 ≥ 0
   - Solving -3c² + 4c + 20 ≥ 0 gives roots c = [4 ± √(16 + 240)]/(-6) = [4 ± 16]/(-6)
   - So c ∈ [-2, 10/3]

5. The difference between sup and inf is (10/3) - (-2) = 10/3 + 6/3 = 16/3

The ground truth answer is correct (16/3), while the proposed answer (8) is incorrect.
