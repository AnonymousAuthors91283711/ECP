Ground Truth Answer: 32
Proposed Answer: 116
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem gives us:
1. T > 20
2. The equation 13 + (T - 20)/4 = T

Let's solve the equation step by step:
13 + (T - 20)/4 = T
=> (T - 20)/4 = T - 13
=> T - 20 = 4(T - 13)
=> T - 20 = 4T - 52
=> -20 + 52 = 4T - T
=> 32 = 3T
=> T = 32/3 ≈ 10.666...

But this contradicts our first condition T > 20, and also doesn't give an integer solution. 

The proposed answer is 116, but:
13 + (116 - 20)/4 = 13 + 96/4 = 13 + 24 = 37 ≠ 116

The ground truth answer is 32, but:
13 + (32 - 20)/4 = 13 + 12/4 = 13 + 3 = 16 ≠ 32

Neither answer satisfies the given equation. However, the ground truth answer (32) is closer to being correct when we consider integer division (where 32/3 would round to 11, making T=33, but still not exact).
