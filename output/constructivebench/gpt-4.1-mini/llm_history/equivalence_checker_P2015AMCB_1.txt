abbrev P2015AMCB_1_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2015AMCB_1 : (2 : ℚ) - (-2 : ℚ)^(-2 : ℤ) = P2015AMCB_1_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 7/4
Proposed Answer: 2 - (-2) ^ (-2 : ℤ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to evaluate the expression 2 - (-2)^(-2) as a rational number.

2. The ground truth answer is 7/4.

3. The proposed answer is the original expression itself: 2 - (-2)^(-2).

Now let's evaluate the expression:
(-2)^(-2) = 1/(-2)^2 = 1/4
Therefore, 2 - (-2)^(-2) = 2 - 1/4 = 8/4 - 1/4 = 7/4

The proposed answer didn't simplify the expression to its final form (7/4), but just restated the original problem. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
