Ground Truth Answer: 25
Proposed Answer: 20
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem consists of two parts:
   - An equation: 10 + 6x = 2*(30 + 2x)
   - An inequality condition: ∀ m < x, 10 + 6m < 2*(30 + 2m)

2. Solving the equation:
   10 + 6x = 60 + 4x
   6x - 4x = 60 - 10
   2x = 50
   x = 25

3. Checking the inequality condition for x=25:
   For all m < 25, 10 + 6m < 60 + 4m
   Which simplifies to 2m < 50 → m < 25 (which holds by definition)

4. Checking the proposed answer (20):
   - Equation: 10 + 6*20 = 130 vs 2*(30 + 2*20) = 140 → 130 ≠ 140
   - The equation is not satisfied

The ground truth answer (25) correctly solves both the equation and satisfies the inequality condition, while the proposed answer (20) fails to satisfy the equation.

<<<False>>>
