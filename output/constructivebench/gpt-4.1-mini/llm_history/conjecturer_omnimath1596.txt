theorem omnimath1596 (c : ℝ) (hc : 0 < c) (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hf : ∀ x > 0, f x > 0) :
  (∀ x > 0, ∀ y > 0, f ((c + 1) * x + f y) = f (x + 2 * y) + 2 * c * x) ↔ f = omnimath1596_answer c := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
<<<fun c x => (c + 1) * x>>>

Explanation: The functional equation imposes a linear form on f; substituting and comparing yields f(x) = (c + 1) * x as the unique positive solution for x>0.
