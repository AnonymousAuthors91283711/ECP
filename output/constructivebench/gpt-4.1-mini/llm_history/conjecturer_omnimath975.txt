theorem omnimath975 : 
  List.foldl circ (2005 : ℚ) (List.range 2006) = omnimath975_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<(2005 + 2005 * 2006) / (2005 * 2006 + 4)>>>

Explanation: The operation circ behaves like a Möbius transformation, and folding over List.range 2006 starting at 2005 simplifies to circ applied to (2005, 2006).
