Ground Truth Answer: 19
Proposed Answer: 1995 * 19
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence x(n) with:
   - x(1) = 19
   - x(2) = 95 = 5*19
   - For n > 1, x(n+2) = lcm(x(n+1), x(n)) + x(n)

2. The ground truth answer claims gcd(x(1995), x(1996)) = 19

3. The proposed answer claims gcd(x(1995), x(1996)) = 1995*19

Analysis:
- The sequence appears to maintain a factor of 19 in all terms (since 19 is prime and appears in initial terms, and the recurrence preserves common factors)
- However, multiplying by 1995 is incorrect - the gcd should be exactly the common factor 19
- The proposed answer is too large by a factor of 1995

<<<False>>>
