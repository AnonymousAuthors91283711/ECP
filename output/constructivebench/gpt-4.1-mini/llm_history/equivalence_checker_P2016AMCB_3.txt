theorem P2016AMCB_3 (x : ℤ) (hx : x = -2016) : 
  P2016AMCB_3_answer x = 4032 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => abs (abs (abs (abs x - x) - abs x) - x)
Proposed Answer: fun x => -2 * x
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a function that takes an integer x and returns 4032 when x = -2016.

2. Ground Truth Answer: This nested absolute value function would evaluate as follows for x = -2016:
   - First innermost: abs(-2016) - (-2016) = 2016 - (-2016) = 4032
   - Next level: abs(4032) - abs(-2016) = 4032 - 2016 = 2016
   - Next level: abs(2016) - (-2016) = 2016 - (-2016) = 4032
   - Which matches the required output when x = -2016

3. Proposed Answer: -2 * x
   - For x = -2016: -2 * (-2016) = 4032
   - This also matches the required output

However, these functions are not equivalent for all inputs:
- For x = 0:
  - Ground Truth: abs(abs(abs(abs 0 - 0) - abs 0) - 0) = 0
  - Proposed: -2 * 0 = 0
- For x = 1:
  - Ground Truth: abs(abs(abs(abs 1 - 1) - abs 1) - 1) = abs(abs(abs(0) - 1) - 1) = abs(abs(0 - 1) - 1) = abs(1 - 1) = 0
  - Proposed: -2 * 1 = -2

The functions only match at x = -2016 and x = 0, but not generally. Since the problem only specifies behavior at x = -2016, both answers satisfy the requirement, but they are not equivalent functions.
