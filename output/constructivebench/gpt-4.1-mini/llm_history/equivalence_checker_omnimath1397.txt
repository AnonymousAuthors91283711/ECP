Ground Truth Answer: 49
Proposed Answer: 16 * 4 - 16
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of distinct integers that can appear in a 16×16 matrix where:
   - Each row has at most 4 distinct values
   - Each column has at most 4 distinct values

2. The ground truth answer is 49, which is known from combinatorial mathematics (this is a variation of the "distinct entries in a matrix" problem).

3. The proposed answer is 16*4 - 16 = 48. This seems to be an attempt at calculating (rows × distinct per row) minus some overlap, but:
   - It doesn't account for the column constraints properly
   - The subtraction of 16 seems arbitrary
   - The correct maximum is known to be slightly higher (49)

The proposed answer is close but not exactly correct. It's in the right ballpark but misses the exact maximum by 1.
