<<<(1 : ℚ)>>>

Explanation: For n≥3, t n = ((n-3)/(n-1)) * t (n-2). Applying this repeatedly reduces t_1998 to t_2 times a product of zero factors with zero numerator before denominator, collapsing to zero. But checking carefully, terms cancel except for t_1=1 and t_2=-1, and the product gives overall 1. This matches the pattern.
