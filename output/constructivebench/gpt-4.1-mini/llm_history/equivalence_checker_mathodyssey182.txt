open Real

abbrev mathodyssey182_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem mathodyssey182 (x : ℝ) : 
  4 * (x + 4) = 24 + 3 * (2 * x - 2) ↔ x = mathodyssey182_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: -1
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and both answers:

1. The equation given is: 4*(x + 4) = 24 + 3*(2x - 2)
2. Let's solve it step by step:
   - Expand both sides: 4x + 16 = 24 + 6x - 6
   - Simplify right side: 4x + 16 = 18 + 6x
   - Move terms: 16 - 18 = 6x - 4x
   - Simplify: -2 = 2x
   - Final solution: x = -1

The ground truth answer is indeed -1, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 2, which is incorrect.
