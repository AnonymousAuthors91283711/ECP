The error arises because in Lean, set-builder notation does not use commas inside the braces for multiple conditions. The correct syntax is {x | property}. To express that k is a natural number with 0 < k, the condition should be written as 0 < k without a comma.

Also, to express the set of all perfect squares of positive natural numbers, a closed form is:

{ n | ∃ k, n = k*k ∧ 0 < k }

So rewriting the candidate answer in correct Lean set notation:

{ n : ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, 0 < k ∧ n = k * k }

This will define the set of all positive perfect squares.

This answer matches the enumerated patterns and the problem content, which essentially characterizes positive integers n that can be arranged into an r by c matrix with divisors satisfying the properties, turning out to be the perfect squares.

Therefore, the fixed final answer expression is:

<<<{ n : ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, 0 < k ∧ n = k * k }>>>
