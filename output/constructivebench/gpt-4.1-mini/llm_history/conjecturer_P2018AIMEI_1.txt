  let S := { (a, b) : ℕ × ℕ | 1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 100 ∧ 0 ≤ b ∧
    ∃ (c d : ℤ), x^2 + a * x + b = (x + c) * (x + d) }

<<<(100 * 101) / 2>>> 

Explanation: For integers c and d, a = c + d and b = c * d; given 1 ≤ a ≤ 100 and b ≥ 0, pairs (a,b) correspond to sums and products of integer pairs (c,d) with nonnegative product. Counting such pairs, the total number is the 100th triangular number. Hence the answer is 100*101/2 mod 1000, but only the cardinality is asked, so (100 * 101) / 2.
