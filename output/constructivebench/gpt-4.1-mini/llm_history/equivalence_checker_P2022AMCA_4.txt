Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 60
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a unique natural number n that satisfies:
   - n > 0
   - lcm(n,18) = 180
   - gcd(n,45) = 15
   - sum of digits in base 10 equals some value (which we can ignore for comparison)

2. Checking the proposed answer (60):
   - lcm(60,18) = 180 (correct)
   - gcd(60,45) = 15 (correct)
   - sum of digits: 6+0 = 6 (matches ground truth)

3. The ground truth answer is 6:
   - lcm(6,18) = 18 ≠ 180 (doesn't satisfy condition)
   - gcd(6,45) = 3 ≠ 15 (doesn't satisfy condition)

The proposed answer (60) correctly satisfies all conditions, while the ground truth answer (6) fails multiple conditions. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
