Ground Truth Answer: 140
Proposed Answer: 70
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a natural number d that satisfies:
   - 10*d/7 - 60 = d
   - This d should be unique (no other d' satisfies the equation)
   - The sum of its digits in base 10 should be 5

2. Ground truth answer is 140:
   - 10*140/7 - 60 = 200 - 60 = 140 ✓
   - Digit sum: 1 + 4 + 0 = 5 ✓

3. Proposed answer is 70:
   - 10*70/7 - 60 = 100 - 60 = 40 ≠ 70 ✗
   - Doesn't satisfy the equation
   - Digit sum would be 7 + 0 = 7 ≠ 5 ✗

The proposed answer fails both the equation and digit sum conditions.

<<<False>>>
