Ground Truth Answer: 315
Proposed Answer: 16
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest positive integer 'a' such that there exists a polynomial P with integer coefficients where:
   - P evaluates to 'a' at x=1,3,5,7
   - P evaluates to '-a' at x=2,4,6,8

2. The ground truth answer is 315. This makes sense because:
   - We can construct a polynomial that oscillates between a and -a at these points
   - The minimal such 'a' would be related to the least common multiple of the differences between evaluation points
   - 315 is indeed the LCM of the relevant differences (it's LCM(1,3,5,7,2,4,6,8) divided by some factors)

3. The proposed answer is 16. This seems too small because:
   - For a polynomial to take the same value at 4 points (1,3,5,7) and the opposite value at 4 other points (2,4,6,8), it would need to have significant variation
   - The minimal polynomial satisfying these conditions would naturally lead to a larger minimal 'a' value
   - 16 doesn't appear to be a plausible LCM or related value for this construction

The proposed answer (16) is incorrect compared to the ground truth (315).
