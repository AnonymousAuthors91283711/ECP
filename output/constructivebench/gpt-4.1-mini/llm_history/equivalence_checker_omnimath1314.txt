Ground Truth Answer: 13/36
Proposed Answer: (1/2 : ℚ)
Let me analyze this problem carefully.

The problem is asking to evaluate the infinite sum:
Σ (from n=0 to ∞) of 1/((n+3)² + (n+1)) in rational numbers.

First, let's examine the denominator:
(n+3)² + (n+1) = n² + 6n + 9 + n + 1 = n² + 7n + 10 = (n+2)(n+5)

So the sum becomes:
Σ (from n=0 to ∞) of 1/((n+2)(n+5))

This can be solved using partial fractions:
1/((n+2)(n+5)) = (1/3)(1/(n+2) - 1/(n+5))

Now the sum becomes telescoping:
(1/3)[(1/2 - 1/5) + (1/3 - 1/6) + (1/4 - 1/7) + (1/5 - 1/8) + ...]

Most terms cancel out, leaving:
(1/3)[1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4] = (1/3)(13/12) = 13/36

The ground truth answer is 13/36, while the proposed answer is 1/2. These are clearly different rational numbers.
