abbrev omnimath2826_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2826 :
  2 * (2 : ℝ) ^ 2 + 3 * (2 : ℝ) ^ 2 = omnimath2826_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 20
Proposed Answer: 14
Let's analyze the problem and both answers:

1. The problem is evaluating the expression: 2 * (2 : ℝ) ^ 2 + 3 * (2 : ℝ) ^ 2
2. Breaking it down:
   - (2 : ℝ) ^ 2 = 4
   - 2 * 4 = 8
   - 3 * 4 = 12
   - 8 + 12 = 20

The ground truth answer correctly evaluates this to 20. The proposed answer of 14 is incorrect as it doesn't match the calculation. 

The proposed answer might have come from incorrectly calculating 2*2 + 3*2 = 4 + 6 = 10 and then squaring the result (10) to get 100, but even that wouldn't give 14. There's no valid calculation path that leads to 14 for this expression.
