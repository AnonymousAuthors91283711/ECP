Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 55
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting the number of positive integer sequences of length 10 (a₀ to a₉) where:
   - The sequence follows a Fibonacci-like recurrence: aₙ₊₂ = aₙ₊₁ + aₙ for n = 0 to 7
   - The last term a₉ is fixed at 2002
   - All terms are positive

2. The ground truth answer is 3, which makes sense because:
   - The sequence is determined by its first two terms (a₀, a₁)
   - The condition a₉ = 2002 creates a linear Diophantine equation in a₀ and a₁
   - There are exactly 3 pairs (a₀, a₁) that satisfy all conditions

3. The proposed answer is 55, which is incorrect because:
   - 55 is the 10th Fibonacci number, but this is irrelevant to the problem
   - It doesn't account for the constraints (a₉ = 2002 and positivity)
   - The actual number of valid sequences is much smaller
