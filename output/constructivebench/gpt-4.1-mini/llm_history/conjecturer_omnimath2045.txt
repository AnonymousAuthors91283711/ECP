noncomputable abbrev omnimath2045_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2045 :
  (∑ k ∈ Finset.Icc 1 2011, (k - 1) / ((Nat.factorial k) * (Nat.factorial (2011 - k))) = omnimath2045_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<1 / (2011 * Nat.factorial 2010)>>>

Explanation: The sum matches the known identity ∑_{k=1}^n (k-1)/(k!(n-k)!) = 1/(n * (n-1)!), for n=2011 this is 1/(2011 * 2010!).
