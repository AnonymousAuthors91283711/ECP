Ground Truth Answer: 27 / 106
Proposed Answer: 4 / 11
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two sums involving arithmetic series:
   - Numerator sum: 3i from 1 to n
   - Denominator sum: 5i from 1 to n
   - Their ratio is given as 4/11

2. We can simplify these sums using the formula for sum of first n natural numbers (∑i = n(n+1)/2):
   - (3n(n+1)/2) / (5n(n+1)/2) = 3/5 for any n > 0
   - But the problem states this equals 4/11, which is impossible since 3/5 ≠ 4/11

3. The ground truth answer 27/106 appears to be for a different problem or with different coefficients.

4. The proposed answer 4/11 matches the given ratio in the problem statement, but as we saw, this is mathematically impossible with the given sums.

The proposed answer matches the given condition in the problem statement, but that condition itself is impossible with the given sums. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
