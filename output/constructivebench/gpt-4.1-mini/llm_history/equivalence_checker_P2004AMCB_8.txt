Ground Truth Answer: fun n => Int.toNat ⌊(Real.sqrt (1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2⌋
Proposed Answer: fun n => Nat.sqrt n + 1
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
We need to find the smallest k such that the sum of the first k odd numbers equals n. The sum of first k odd numbers is known to be k² (since 1+3+5+...+(2k-1) = k²).

Ground Truth Answer:
This correctly solves k² ≤ n < (k+1)² by using the quadratic formula derived from k² ≤ n. The expression (√(1+8n)-1)/2 comes from solving the equation k(k+1)/2 = n (which is for triangular numbers, not odd numbers), but in this case it's actually incorrect for the problem of summing odd numbers.

Proposed Answer:
Nat.sqrt n + 1 is incorrect for this problem. The correct solution should be ⌈√n⌉, but Nat.sqrt n gives the floor of the square root, so Nat.sqrt n + 1 would be equivalent to ⌊√n⌋ + 1, which is not always correct.

For example:
- When n=100 (as in the problem statement), √100 = 10, so k=10 is correct (sum is 100)
- Proposed answer gives Nat.sqrt 100 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 (incorrect)
- Ground truth answer gives (√801-1)/2 ≈ (28.3-1)/2 ≈ 13.65 → floor is 13 (also incorrect)

Both answers are actually wrong for this problem, but they're wrong in different ways. The ground truth answer solves a different problem (triangular numbers), while the proposed answer is closer but still incorrect.
