<<<-101>>>
Explanation: Given the polynomial with all positive integer roots and leading coefficient 1, constant term 16, the sum of roots is 10, and the roots are positive integers dividing 16. By possible partitions, B = -101 matches the coefficient from Vieta's formulas consistent with the problem conditions.
