The error comes from the fact that "9 + 15 = 24" is a proposition (a statement that 9+15 equals 24), not a natural number. You want to assign the numeral 24 as the answer, not a proposition that 9+15 equals 24.

Given the problem statement and the hint that the maximal number n is related to 9 (girls) and 15 (boys), a natural maximal number should be 24 (the total number of individuals). This fits the intuition that the greatest collection size is the total union.

Hence, the corrected answer abbreviation should be simply 24.
