Ground Truth Answer: 600 / 7
Proposed Answer: 120
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a scenario with:
   - Train interval: 3/60 hours (3 minutes)
   - Passing interval: 10/60 hours (10 minutes)
   - Linh's speed: 60 km/h
   - We need to find the train's speed (v)

2. The equation setup is correct:
   passing_interval = train_distance / relative_speed
   10/60 = (v * 3/60) / (v - 60)

3. Solving the equation:
   (10/60)(v - 60) = (3/60)v
   (10v - 600)/60 = 3v/60
   10v - 600 = 3v
   7v = 600
   v = 600/7 ≈ 85.714 km/h

4. The ground truth answer is 600/7 (correct)
5. The proposed answer is 120 (incorrect)

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the equation when substituted back:
(10/60)(120 - 60) = (3/60)120
10 = 6 → False

<<<False>>>
