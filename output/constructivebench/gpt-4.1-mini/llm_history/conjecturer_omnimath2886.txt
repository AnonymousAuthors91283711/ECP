Explanation:
From the system 9x + 4y = 600 and kx - 4y = 24 with x,y > 0, rewrite as y = (600 - 9x)/4, and substitute into second: kx - (600 - 9x) = 24, so kx - 600 + 9x = 24 ⇒ kx + 9x = 624 ⇒ x(k + 9) = 624. Since x,y > 0 integral, x divides 624 and y = (600 - 9x)/4 positive integer. So count positive integer divisors x of 624 with (600 - 9x) divisible by 4 and positive y. Among these, each yields unique k = (24 + 4y)/x. The number of such k is the number of such x. The count is 16.
