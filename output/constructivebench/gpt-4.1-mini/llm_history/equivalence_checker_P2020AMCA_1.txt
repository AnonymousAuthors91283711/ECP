abbrev P2020AMCA_1_answer : â„š := sorry
theorem P2020AMCA_1 : 
  let remainder := 1 - 7/10
  let maria_took := (1/3) * remainder
  1 - 7/10 - maria_took = P2020AMCA_1_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1/5
Proposed Answer: 1 - 7/10 - (1/3) * (1 - 7/10)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem defines:
   - remainder = 1 - 7/10 = 3/10
   - maria_took = (1/3) * remainder = (1/3)*(3/10) = 1/10

2. The expression to evaluate is:
   1 - 7/10 - maria_took = 3/10 - 1/10 = 2/10 = 1/5

3. The ground truth answer is indeed 1/5.

4. The proposed answer is the expression: 1 - 7/10 - (1/3)*(1 - 7/10)
   - This is exactly equal to the left side of the theorem statement
   - When computed, it equals 1/5 as shown above

The proposed answer is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth answer, just in an unsimplified form. Both evaluate to 1/5.
