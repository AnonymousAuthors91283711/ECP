(f : ℝ → ℝ)
(hf : f = fun x => Real.sin x ^ 6 + Real.cos x ^ 6 - 0.7 * (Real.sin x ^ 4 + Real.cos x ^ 4))

Ground Truth Answer: {x : ℝ | ∃ k : ℤ, x = (1 : ℝ)/6 * Real.pi + Real.pi * k ∨ x = (1 : ℝ)/3 * Real.pi + Real.pi * k ∨ x = (2 : ℝ)/3 * Real.pi + Real.pi * k ∨ x = (5 : ℝ)/6 * Real.pi + Real.pi * k}
Proposed Answer: {x | Real.sin x ^ 6 + Real.cos x ^ 6 = 0.7 * (Real.sin x ^ 4 + Real.cos x ^ 4)}

The proposed answer correctly captures the equation from the problem statement (f x = 0) in set-builder notation, but it doesn't provide the explicit solution set in terms of π and integer multiples like the ground truth answer does. The ground truth answer gives the exact periodic solutions, while the proposed answer just restates the condition without solving it. They are equivalent in terms of defining the same set of real numbers, but the proposed answer lacks the explicit form that was asked for in the problem.
