Ground Truth Answer: 25
Proposed Answer: 19
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n such that there exists an integer polynomial P where:
1. P(-10) = 145
2. P(9) = 164
3. |P(0)| = n

The ground truth answer is 25, while the proposed answer is 19.

To verify, let's consider the polynomial differences:
- The difference between inputs is 9 - (-10) = 19
- The difference between outputs is 164 - 145 = 19

This suggests that the minimal polynomial satisfying these conditions would have a linear term of x + 155 (since 145 - (-10) = 155, but this doesn't match the other point). 

However, the minimal solution actually comes from considering the constant term. The smallest possible |P(0)| is indeed 25, achieved by a polynomial like P(x) = x + 155 (but this gives P(0)=155, which is too large) or more likely a higher degree polynomial that satisfies all conditions with P(0)=25.

The proposed answer 19 is incorrect because while the output difference is 19, this doesn't directly translate to the minimal |P(0)|. The correct minimal value is indeed 25.
