abbrev olympiadbench2338_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2338 :
  {x : ℝ | (x ^ 2 + x + 4) / (2 * x + 1) = 4 / x} = olympiadbench2338_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {-2, -1, 2}
Proposed Answer: { x | x ≠ 0 ∧ (x^2 + x + 4) * x = 4 * (2 * x + 1) }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer correctly transforms the original equation by cross-multiplying to eliminate denominators, which gives the correct equation (x² + x + 4)*x = 4*(2x + 1). However, it's missing the final step of solving this equation to find the specific solutions {-2, -1, 2}. The proposed answer is correct in its transformation but incomplete as it doesn't provide the final simplified solution set.
