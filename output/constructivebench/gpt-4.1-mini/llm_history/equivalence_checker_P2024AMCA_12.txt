Ground Truth Answer: 21
Proposed Answer: (List.sum (digits 10 (720 * 6^2)))
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem asks for the minimal sum of digits of a number a*r² where:
   - a < 720
   - 720 < a*r²
   - 720 = a*r

2. From 720 = a*r, we can express a = 720/r. Since a must be natural, r must divide 720.

3. The proposed answer calculates List.sum (digits 10 (720 * 6²)):
   - r = 6 (since a = 720/6 = 120 < 720)
   - a*r² = 120 * 36 = 4320
   - Sum of digits: 4 + 3 + 2 + 0 = 9

4. However, the ground truth answer is 21, which suggests there's a better solution:
   - For r = 5: a = 144, a*r² = 3600 → sum=9
   - For r = 4: a = 180, a*r² = 2880 → sum=18
   - For r = 3: a = 240, a*r² = 2160 → sum=9
   - For r = 2: a = 360, a*r² = 1440 → sum=9
   - For r = 1: a = 720 (invalid as a < 720)

The proposed answer gives a sum of 9, which is better than the claimed ground truth of 21. This suggests either:
- The ground truth is incorrect
- Or there's a misunderstanding of the problem constraints

Since the proposed answer satisfies all constraints and gives a better (smaller) sum than the ground truth, they cannot be equivalent.
