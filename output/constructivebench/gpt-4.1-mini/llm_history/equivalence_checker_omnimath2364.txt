Ground Truth Answer: {0, (sqrt 5 - 1)/2}
Proposed Answer: { x : ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, c^2 = 1 - x^2 ∧ (c + x / c)^2 = 4 * x }
Let me analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

The problem is about finding for which values of sinθ there exists exactly one real solution r to the given quadratic equation in r. 

The ground truth answer {0, (sqrt 5 - 1)/2} gives two specific values where this condition holds. 

The proposed answer is a set defined by a more complex condition involving x (which represents sinθ) and an auxiliary variable c. 

To check equivalence:
1. For x=0: The proposed answer's condition reduces to ∃c, c²=1 ∧ c²=0 which is false, but ground truth includes 0. So they disagree on x=0.
2. For x=(√5-1)/2: The proposed answer's condition would need to be checked, but since it already fails on x=0, we can conclude the answers are not equivalent.

The proposed answer seems to be attempting a different characterization but doesn't match the ground truth, particularly missing x=0.
