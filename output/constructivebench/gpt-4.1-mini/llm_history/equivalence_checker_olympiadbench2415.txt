Ground Truth Answer: fun x => (x - 1) * (x - 2) / 6
Proposed Answer: fun m : ℝ => (m - 1) * (m - 2) / 6
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. Both answers are functions taking a real number as input.
2. The ground truth uses `x` as the parameter name while the proposed answer uses `m`, but this is just a naming difference.
3. The mathematical expressions are identical: `(x - 1) * (x - 2) / 6` vs `(m - 1) * (m - 2) / 6`.

The only difference is the variable name, which doesn't affect the mathematical meaning. The expressions are completely equivalent.
