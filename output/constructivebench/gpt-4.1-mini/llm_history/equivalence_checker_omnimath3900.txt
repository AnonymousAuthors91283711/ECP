Ground Truth Answer: fun n => if n = 0 then 1 else 
    (n.factorization).prod fun p α => p^(p^α - 1)
Proposed Answer: fun n => n^(n - 1)
Let's analyze this carefully.

1. The problem is asking for a function f where:
   - The number of divisors of f(x) equals x
   - f satisfies a specific divisibility condition for products

2. The ground truth answer:
   - For n=0: returns 1
   - For n>0: returns product of p^(p^α-1) for each prime factor p with exponent α in n's factorization
   - This correctly gives a number with exactly n divisors (since divisor count is multiplicative)

3. The proposed answer:
   - Simply returns n^(n-1)
   - This would have n divisors only when n is prime (since n^(n-1) has n divisors)
   - Fails for composite numbers (e.g., n=4: 4^3=64 has 4 divisors, but n=6: 6^5=7776 has 20 divisors ≠ 6)

The proposed answer only works for prime numbers and fails for composites, while the ground truth works for all natural numbers.
