theorem P2005AMCB_4 (totalQuizzes firstA : ℕ) 
  (h₁ : totalQuizzes = 50) (h₂ : firstA = 22) (h₃ : 30 ≤ totalQuizzes) :
  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | ∃ (remainingA : ℕ), 
    firstA + remainingA ≥ 4 * totalQuizzes / 5 ∧ 
    n = (totalQuizzes - 30) - remainingA} 
  (P2005AMCB_4_answer (totalQuizzes, firstA)) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun ⟨totalQuizzes, firstA⟩ => 
    let remainingQuizzes := totalQuizzes - 30
    let requiredA := (4 * totalQuizzes / 5) - firstA
    remainingQuizzes - requiredA
Proposed Answer: fun x => (x.1 - 30) - (4 * x.1 / 5 - x.2)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both answers:
1. Take a pair (totalQuizzes, firstA) as input (x in the proposed answer)
2. Calculate remainingQuizzes as totalQuizzes - 30 (x.1 - 30)
3. Calculate requiredA as (4*totalQuizzes/5) - firstA (4*x.1/5 - x.2)
4. Return the difference between remainingQuizzes and requiredA

The only difference is syntactic (using x.1/x.2 vs named parameters), but the mathematical operations and logic are identical.
