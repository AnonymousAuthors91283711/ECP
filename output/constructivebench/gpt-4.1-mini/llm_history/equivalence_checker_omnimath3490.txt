Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 8 * n
Proposed Answer: fun n => 6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function f(n) that satisfies certain conditions when n=7:
   - f(7) must be even
   - 9*7 must be odd
   - 7+8 must be odd
   - 7² must be odd
   - 7*(7-2) must be odd

2. Ground truth answer (8*n):
   - f(7) = 56 (even) ✔
   - 9*7 = 63 (odd) ✔
   - 7+8 = 15 (odd) ✔
   - 7² = 49 (odd) ✔
   - 7*5 = 35 (odd) ✔

3. Proposed answer (6):
   - f(7) = 6 (even) ✔
   - 9*7 = 63 (odd) ✔
   - 7+8 = 15 (odd) ✔
   - 7² = 49 (odd) ✔
   - 7*5 = 35 (odd) ✔

Both answers satisfy all the conditions when n=7. However, the ground truth answer is a general solution for any n, while the proposed answer is a constant function that only works for n=7. The problem statement only specifies the behavior at n=7, so both answers are technically correct for the given constraints.
