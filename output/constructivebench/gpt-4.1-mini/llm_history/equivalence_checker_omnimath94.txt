theorem omnimath94 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ m n : ℕ, f (m + n) * f (m - n) = f (m^2)) ↔ f = omnimath94_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun _ => 1
Proposed Answer: fun n => if n = 0 then 0 else 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a function f : ℕ → ℕ that satisfies the functional equation:
   ∀ m n, f (m + n) * f (m - n) = f (m²)

2. The ground truth answer is the constant function f(n) = 1 for all n ∈ ℕ.

3. The proposed answer is a piecewise function that returns 0 at n=0 and 1 otherwise.

Now let's test the proposed answer against the functional equation:

For m=0, n=0:
f(0+0)*f(0-0) = f(0)*f(0) = 0*0 = 0
f(0²) = f(0) = 0
This case holds.

For m=1, n=0:
f(1+0)*f(1-0) = f(1)*f(1) = 1*1 = 1
f(1²) = f(1) = 1
This case holds.

For m=1, n=1:
f(1+1)*f(1-1) = f(2)*f(0) = 1*0 = 0
f(1²) = f(1) = 1
Here 0 ≠ 1, so the equation fails.

The proposed answer fails when m=n≠0, while the ground truth answer satisfies all cases. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
