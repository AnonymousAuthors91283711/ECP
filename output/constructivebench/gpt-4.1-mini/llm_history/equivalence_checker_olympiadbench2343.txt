Ground Truth Answer: 26
Proposed Answer: 15
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find a unique natural number k between 2 and 40 that satisfies the equation:
   (k*(k-1))/(40*39) = 5/12

2. Let's test the ground truth answer (26):
   (26*25)/(40*39) = 650/1560 = 5/12 ✓

3. Now test the proposed answer (15):
   (15*14)/(40*39) = 210/1560 ≈ 0.1346
   5/12 ≈ 0.4167
   These are not equal.

The proposed answer (15) does not satisfy the given equation, while the ground truth answer (26) does.

<<<False>>>
