Ground Truth Answer: 25
Proposed Answer: (100 : ℝ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find x*y where x and y are real numbers greater than 1 that satisfy two logarithmic equations.

2. The ground truth answer is 25, meaning x*y = 25 is the correct solution.

3. The proposed answer is 100, meaning x*y = 100.

4. These are clearly different numerical values (25 ≠ 100).

5. The logarithmic conditions in the problem lead to a unique solution where x*y must be 25, not 100.

Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect.
