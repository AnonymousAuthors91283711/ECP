Ground Truth Answer: (251, 7)
Proposed Answer: (127, 158)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find natural numbers (a, b) where a is prime and b > 0 that satisfy the given equation.

2. The ground truth answer is (251, 7). Let's verify it:
   9*(2*251 + 7)^2 = 9*509^2 = 9*259081 = 2331729
   509*(4*251 + 511*7) = 509*(1004 + 3577) = 509*4581 = 2331729
   This checks out.

3. The proposed answer is (127, 158). Let's test it:
   9*(2*127 + 158)^2 = 9*(254 + 158)^2 = 9*412^2 = 9*169744 = 1527696
   509*(4*127 + 511*158) = 509*(508 + 80738) = 509*81246 ≈ 4.13×10^7
   These are clearly not equal.

The proposed answer does not satisfy the equation, while the ground truth does.

<<<False>>>
