abbrev olympiadbench2275_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2275 : 
  (digits 10 ((10^3 + 1)^2)).sum = olympiadbench2275_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1002001
Proposed Answer: (10^3 + 1)^2 - 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the sum of the digits of (10³ + 1)² when written in base 10.

2. First, let's compute (10³ + 1)²:
   (1000 + 1)² = 1001² = 1002001

3. The sum of digits of 1002001 is:
   1 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 4

4. The ground truth answer is 1002001, which is the actual value of (10³ + 1)², not the sum of its digits. This appears to be a mismatch between the problem statement and the ground truth answer.

5. The proposed answer is (10³ + 1)² - 1 = 1002001 - 1 = 1002000, which is also not the sum of digits.

Both answers are incorrect for the problem as stated (sum of digits), but they are both close to the actual value of (10³ + 1)². The ground truth answer is exactly (10³ + 1)² while the proposed answer is off by 1.

Given that neither answer correctly solves the problem as stated, but they are both related to the expression being evaluated, I'll mark this as:
