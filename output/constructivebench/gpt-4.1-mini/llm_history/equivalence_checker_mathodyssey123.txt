Ground Truth Answer: 39
Proposed Answer: 20
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest possible sum of a subset A of {0,...,20} where:
   - A and B are disjoint subsets of {0,...,20}
   - For every n in A, 2n+2 must be in B
   - We want to maximize the sum of A

2. The ground truth answer is 39. This can be achieved by taking A = {19,20} (sum=39) and B = {40,42}, but since B must be ⊆ {0,...,20}, this isn't valid. The actual maximum comes from A = {9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20} with sum=174, but this contradicts the ground truth. There seems to be confusion here.

3. The proposed answer is 20, which would correspond to A = {20}. However, this would require B = {42}, which is outside the allowed range.

Given this analysis, neither answer seems correct under the given constraints. However, since the ground truth is stated as 39 and the proposed answer is 20, they are clearly different values.
