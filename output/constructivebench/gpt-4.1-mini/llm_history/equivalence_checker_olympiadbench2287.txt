Ground Truth Answer: {2, -6 - 4 * Real.sqrt 2}
Proposed Answer: {(3 * (1 + Real.sqrt 2)) / 2, (3 * (1 - Real.sqrt 2)) / 2}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives two sums of geometric series (S4 and S8) and asks for the values of 'a' that satisfy both equations when S4 and S8 have specific values involving √2.

2. The ground truth answer gives two values: 2 and -6 - 4√2.

3. The proposed answer gives two different values: (3(1+√2))/2 and (3(1-√2))/2.

4. We can verify by plugging in the ground truth values:
   - For a=2, we can find r that satisfies both equations
   - For a=-6-4√2, we can also find r that satisfies both equations
   - The proposed answers don't match either of these values

5. The proposed answers appear to be solutions to a different equation (perhaps just considering the S4 condition alone), but they don't satisfy both S4 and S8 conditions simultaneously.
