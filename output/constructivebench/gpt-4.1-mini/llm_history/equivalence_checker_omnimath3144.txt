Ground Truth Answer: 2 / Real.exp 1
Proposed Answer: Real.sqrt 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves evaluating the limit of an infinite product as x approaches 1 from below. This is a non-trivial infinite product that requires careful analysis.

2. The ground truth answer is 2/e (where e is Euler's number, approximately 2.71828), which would be about 0.73576.

3. The proposed answer is √2 (approximately 1.4142), which is significantly different from the ground truth answer.

4. The two values (0.73576 vs 1.4142) are clearly not equal, and the difference is too large to be explained by domain constraints or minor errors.

5. There's no obvious mathematical relationship or transformation that would make these two answers equivalent.
