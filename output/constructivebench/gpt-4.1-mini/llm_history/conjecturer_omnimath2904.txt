  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 20 < n ∧ 
  13 + (n - 20) / 4 = n / 2 ∧ 
  (n - 20) % 4 = 0} omnimath2904_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<52>>> 
Explanation: The system of equations 13 + (n - 20)/4 = n/2 and (n - 20)%4 = 0 for n > 20 implies n - 20 is divisible by 4 and satisfies the linear equality. Simplifying leads to n = 52 as the least such natural number.
