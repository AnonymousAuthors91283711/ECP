theorem P2009AMCB_8 (a b : ℝ) :
  ∃ (w : ℝ) (c : ℝ), 
    (2/3 * c + w = a) ∧ 
    (1/2 * c + w = b) ∧ 
    (c + w = P2009AMCB_8_answer a b) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => 3 * a - 2 * b
Proposed Answer: fun a b => 2 * a - b
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem presents a system of equations:
1. (2/3)c + w = a
2. (1/2)c + w = b
3. c + w = answer(a, b)

We need to solve for c and w in terms of a and b, then find c + w.

From equation 1: w = a - (2/3)c
From equation 2: w = b - (1/2)c

Setting them equal:
a - (2/3)c = b - (1/2)c
a - b = (2/3 - 1/2)c
a - b = (1/6)c
c = 6(a - b)

Now substitute back to find w:
w = a - (2/3)(6)(a - b) = a - 4(a - b) = -3a + 4b

Now c + w = 6(a - b) + (-3a + 4b) = 3a - 2b

The ground truth answer is correct (3a - 2b), while the proposed answer (2a - b) is incorrect.
