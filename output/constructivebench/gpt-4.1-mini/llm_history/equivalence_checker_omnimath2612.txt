Ground Truth Answer: 3240
Proposed Answer: Nat.choose 10 3 * 3 ^ 3
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem is counting the number of pairs of subsets (S, T) of a 10-element set where the union S ∪ T has exactly 3 elements.

The proposed answer is C(10,3) * 3³, which breaks down as:
1. C(10,3) - choosing which 3 elements will be in the union
2. 3³ - for each of the 3 elements, it can be in S only, T only, or both

This is indeed the correct combinatorial approach:
- First select which 3 elements will be involved in the union
- Then for each of these 3 elements, it has 3 possibilities (S only, T only, or both)
- The remaining 7 elements must be in neither S nor T

Calculating: C(10,3) = 120, and 3³ = 27, so 120 * 27 = 3240, which matches the ground truth answer.
