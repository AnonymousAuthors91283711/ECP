Ground Truth Answer: 24
Proposed Answer: 25
Let's analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n where:
   - n > 0
   - The sum of squares from 1² to n² is divisible by 100

2. The sum of squares formula is: ∑i² = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6

3. We need to find the smallest n where this sum ≡ 0 mod 100

4. Ground truth answer is 24:
   - Sum for n=24: 24*25*49/6 = 4900 ≡ 0 mod 100
   - Checking n=23: 23*24*47/6 = 4324 ≡ 24 mod 100

5. Proposed answer is 25:
   - Sum for n=25: 25*26*51/6 = 5525 ≡ 25 mod 100
   - This doesn't satisfy the condition (5525%100=25≠0)

The proposed answer (25) is incorrect because:
- It doesn't satisfy the divisibility condition
- The correct smallest n is indeed 24

<<<False>>>
