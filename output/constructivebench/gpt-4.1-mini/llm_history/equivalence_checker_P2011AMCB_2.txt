Ground Truth Answer: 90
Proposed Answer: 88
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number x such that when added to the given scores (90,80,70,60,85), the average of all 6 scores is at least 3 points higher than the average of the original 5 scores.

2. First, calculate the average of the original 5 scores:
   (90 + 80 + 70 + 60 + 85)/5 = 385/5 = 77

3. The new average requirement is: 77 + 3 = 80

4. The inequality becomes: (385 + x)/6 ≥ 80
   => 385 + x ≥ 480
   => x ≥ 95

5. The smallest natural number satisfying this is 95.

Wait, this contradicts both the ground truth (90) and proposed answer (88). This suggests there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement interpretation.

Looking back at the problem, it's possible the inequality is (sum + x)/6 ≥ (sum)/5 + 3, which is what we did. Both given answers (90 and 88) are incorrect based on this calculation.

However, if the problem was different (perhaps about median or some other condition), the answers might make sense. Given the information we have:
