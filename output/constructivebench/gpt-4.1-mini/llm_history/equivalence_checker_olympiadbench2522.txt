Ground Truth Answer: 50
Proposed Answer: 21
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a scenario with two speeds (paddle=7, swim=2) and total time=1.5 hours (90 minutes). It asks to find a time value (in minutes) that satisfies certain conditions about time allocation between paddling and swimming.

2. The ground truth answer is 50, which suggests the solution involves finding that 50 minutes is the meaningful time difference in this scenario.

3. The proposed answer is 21, which is significantly different from 50.

4. Looking at the mathematical conditions:
   - The equations set up relationships between paddling time (t₁) and swimming time (t₂)
   - The final condition relates the answer to the difference between total time and (t₁ + (total_time - t₂))
   - 21 doesn't satisfy these conditions when worked through the equations

5. The proposed answer (21) doesn't match the ground truth (50) and doesn't appear to satisfy the given equations.
