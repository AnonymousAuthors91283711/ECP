theorem olympiadbench2908 : 
  2^(log 800 / log 4) / 2^(log 64 / log 16) = olympiadbench2908_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 10
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The expression is: 2^(log 800 / log 4) / 2^(log 64 / log 16)

2. We can simplify this using logarithm properties:
   - log 800 / log 4 = log₄ 800
   - log 64 / log 16 = log₁₆ 64
   - So the expression becomes 2^(log₄ 800) / 2^(log₁₆ 64)

3. Using the change of base formula and exponent rules:
   - 2^(log₄ 800) = (4^(1/2))^(log₄ 800) = 4^((1/2)log₄ 800) = 4^(log₄ √800) = √800
   - Similarly, 2^(log₁₆ 64) = √(16^(log₁₆ 64)) = √64 = 8

4. So the expression simplifies to √800 / 8 = (√(400*2))/8 = (20√2)/8 = (5√2)/2 ≈ 3.5355

Neither the ground truth answer (10) nor the proposed answer (8) matches this calculation. However, the ground truth answer (10) is actually correct when we consider:

- log₄ 800 ≈ 4.82
- log₁₆ 64 = 1.5 (since 16^1.5 = 64)
- 2^4.82 ≈ 28.0
- 2^1.5 ≈ 2.828
- 28.0/2.828 ≈ 9.9 ≈ 10

The proposed answer (8) is incorrect.
