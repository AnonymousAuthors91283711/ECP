Ground Truth Answer: fun (a, b) (c, d) => a * c + b * d
Proposed Answer: fun p q => (p.1 - q.1) * (q.2 - p.2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function that takes two pairs of natural numbers and returns a natural number, with the specific example that when given (3,1) and (4,2), it should return 14.

2. Ground Truth: fun (a, b) (c, d) => a * c + b * d
   - For (3,1) (4,2): 3*4 + 1*2 = 12 + 2 = 14 (correct)
   - This is the standard dot product formula

3. Proposed Answer: fun p q => (p.1 - q.1) * (q.2 - p.2)
   - For (3,1) (4,2): (3-4)*(2-1) = (-1)*(1) = -1 ≠ 14
   - The result is negative, which violates the ℕ output type
   - The formula is completely different from the dot product

The proposed answer gives a completely different result and doesn't satisfy the given example. It also violates the output type constraint (ℕ).
