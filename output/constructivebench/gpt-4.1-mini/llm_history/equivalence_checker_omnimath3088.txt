Ground Truth Answer: 1/2
Proposed Answer: (2 / 5 : ℚ)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

1. The problem is about calculating the probability that Pedro sits either in position 1 or position 3, given that:
   - There are 5 people and 5 chairs
   - David is fixed in position 2
   - The seating must be bijective (permutation)

2. Total valid seatings (denominator):
   - With David fixed in position 2, we have 4! = 24 possible arrangements for the other 4 people.

3. Favorable seatings (numerator):
   - Pedro in position 1: The remaining 3 people can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways
   - Pedro in position 3: Similarly 6 ways
   - Total favorable = 6 + 6 = 12

4. Probability = 12/24 = 1/2

The proposed answer is 2/5, which doesn't match our calculation. The correct answer should be 1/2.
