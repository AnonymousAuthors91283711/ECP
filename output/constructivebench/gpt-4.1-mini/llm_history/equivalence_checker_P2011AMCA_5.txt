theorem P2011AMCA_5 : 
  P2011AMCA_5_answer = (30 : ℚ) / (100 - 25) * 100 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 40
Proposed Answer: (30 : ℚ) / (100 - 25) * 100
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem presents a mathematical expression: (30 : ℚ) / (100 - 25) * 100
2. The ground truth answer is given as 40
3. The proposed answer is the expression itself: (30 : ℚ) / (100 - 25) * 100

Now let's evaluate the expression:
- First, denominator: 100 - 25 = 75
- Then division: 30 / 75 = 0.4
- Finally multiplication: 0.4 * 100 = 40

The proposed answer is the unevaluated expression, but when evaluated, it equals the ground truth answer of 40. Therefore, they are equivalent.
