theorem omnimath3698 (x y z : ℕ) :
    (2013^x + 2014^y = 2015^z) ↔ (x, y, z) ∈ omnimath3698_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 1, 1)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1, 1)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation is 2013^x + 2014^y = 2015^z
2. Ground truth claims only (0,1,1) is a solution
3. Proposed answer claims (1,1,1) is a solution

Testing the ground truth:
2013^0 + 2014^1 = 1 + 2014 = 2015 = 2015^1 → Correct

Testing the proposed answer:
2013^1 + 2014^1 = 2013 + 2014 = 4027 ≠ 2015^1 = 2015 → Incorrect

The proposed answer is clearly wrong as it doesn't satisfy the equation, while the ground truth is correct.

<<<False>>>
