Ground Truth Answer: 2015 / 2
Proposed Answer: 2015
Let me analyze this problem carefully.

The problem is asking to find the value(s) of x that satisfy the equation (x-a)(x-b) = (x-c)(x-d) under the given conditions. Let's expand both sides:

Left side: x² - (a+b)x + ab
Right side: x² - (c+d)x + cd

Setting them equal:
x² - (a+b)x + ab = x² - (c+d)x + cd
Simplify:
-(a+b)x + ab = -(c+d)x + cd
Rearrange:
(c+d - a - b)x = cd - ab

From the given conditions:
h1: a + d = 2015 ⇒ d = 2015 - a
h2: b + c = 2015 ⇒ c = 2015 - b

Substitute c and d:
((2015-b) + (2015-a) - a - b)x = (2015-b)(2015-a) - ab
Simplify:
(4030 - 2a - 2b)x = (2015)(2015) - 2015a - 2015b + ab - ab
(4030 - 2(a+b))x = 2015² - 2015(a+b)

Factor out 2 from left and 2015 from right:
2(2015 - (a+b))x = 2015(2015 - (a+b))

Assuming (2015 - (a+b)) ≠ 0 (which is guaranteed since a ≠ c ⇒ a ≠ 2015 - b ⇒ a + b ≠ 2015), we can divide both sides by (2015 - (a+b)):
2x = 2015 ⇒ x = 2015/2

The ground truth answer is correct (2015/2), while the proposed answer (2015) is incorrect.
