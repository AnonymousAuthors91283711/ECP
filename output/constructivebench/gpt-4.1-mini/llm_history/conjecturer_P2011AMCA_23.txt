The given Lean code has an error because the function `f` is not defined or declared in the context. Without knowing the definition of `f`, Lean cannot interpret `f a b (f a b (f a b (f a b z)))`.

Since the context is about complex numbers `a` with `|a| = 1`, and `b` with `|b| = r` and iterating `f` four times to get back to `z`, this suggests `f` is an involution of order 4 on complex numbers parameterized by `a` and `b`.

In some geometry or complex transformations problems, such an `f` might represent a Mobius transformation or a particular linear fractional transformation. The fact that applying `f` four times is identity hints that `f` generates a cyclic group of order 4.

Given that the problem asks for the difference between supremum and infimum of such radii `r` for which there exists such a `b`, this likely boils down to the set of `|b|` values lying between two bounds, and the difference is a fixed constant.

From general experience with similar problems involving four-fold iterates being identity, the difference is often 2.

Hence the candidate answer is `2`.

Because the error is mainly due to missing definition of `f`, and the task here is to fix the final answer expression (which is `⟨sorry⟩`), the natural fix is just to put `2` as a real number constant in Lean.

Therefore, I propose replacing `sorry` with `2`.
