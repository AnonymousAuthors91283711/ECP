Ground Truth Answer: 72576000
Proposed Answer: 10! * 120
<<<True>>>

The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Here's why:

1. 10! (10 factorial) is 3628800
2. 10! * 120 = 3628800 * 120 = 435456000
3. However, the ground truth answer is 72576000
4. But 72576000 is actually equal to 10! * 20 (since 3628800 * 20 = 72576000)

Wait, this seems contradictory to my initial assessment. Let me re-evaluate:

Upon closer inspection, the proposed answer (10! * 120) equals 435456000, which does not match the ground truth answer of 72576000. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
