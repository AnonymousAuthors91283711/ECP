noncomputable abbrev omnimath990_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath990 (a : ℝ) (ha : 1 < a) :
  HasSum (fun i : ℕ => (a * i) / (a^i)) (omnimath990_answer a) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a => (a / (1 - a))^2
Proposed Answer: fun a : ℝ => a / (a - 1)^2
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: (a / (1 - a))^2
2. Proposed: a / (a - 1)^2

Let's simplify both expressions:

Ground Truth:
(a / (1 - a))^2 = a² / (1 - a)² = a² / (a - 1)²

Proposed:
a / (a - 1)²

These are clearly different expressions. The ground truth has a² in the numerator while the proposed has just a. 

We can test with a concrete value, say a = 2:
- Ground Truth: (2 / (1 - 2))^2 = (-2)^2 = 4
- Proposed: 2 / (2 - 1)^2 = 2/1 = 2

The results are different (4 ≠ 2), confirming they are not equivalent.
