abbrev omnimath3620_answer : Set (ℝ → ℝ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3620
: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x y : ℝ, f x + f (y * f x + f y) = f (x + 2 * f y) + x * y} = omnimath3620_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {fun x => x + 1}
Proposed Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a b : ℝ, f = (fun x => a * x + b) ∧ (a = 0 ∨ a = 2) ∧ b = 0}
