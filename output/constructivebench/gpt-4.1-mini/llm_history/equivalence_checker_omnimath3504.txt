theorem omnimath3504 (x : ℝ) : 
  x / 2 < x^2 ∧ x^2 < x ↔ x ∈ omnimath3504_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {x | x / 2 < x^2 ∧ x^2 < x}
Proposed Answer: {x | 0 < x ∧ x < 1 ∧ x < 2} \ {1}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the set of real numbers x where x/2 < x² and x² < x.

2. Ground truth answer directly states the set definition matching the problem statement.

3. Proposed answer gives {x | 0 < x ∧ x < 1 ∧ x < 2} \ {1}

Let's solve the inequalities to check equivalence:

First inequality: x/2 < x²
- For x > 0: 1/2 < x → x > 0.5
- For x < 0: 1/2 > x → all x < 0 satisfy this

Second inequality: x² < x
- This implies 0 < x < 1

Combining both:
- For x > 0: must satisfy both x > 0.5 and x < 1 → 0.5 < x < 1
- For x < 0: must satisfy x² < x, but x² is always positive while x is negative → no solutions

Thus the complete solution is 0.5 < x < 1.

The proposed answer includes:
- All x where 0 < x < 1 ∧ x < 2 (which is 0 < x < 1) minus {1}
- But it's missing the x > 0.5 constraint
- Also, it includes 0 < x < 0.5 which shouldn't be there
- And excludes 1 unnecessarily (since 1 isn't in solution anyway)
