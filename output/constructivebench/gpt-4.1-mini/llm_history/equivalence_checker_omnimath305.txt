Ground Truth Answer: {1}
Proposed Answer: { n : ℕ | n = 1 }
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The ground truth answer is {1}, which is the singleton set containing only the natural number 1. The proposed answer is { n : ℕ | n = 1 }, which is the set of all natural numbers n such that n equals 1. These two expressions are mathematically equivalent - they both represent the same set containing only the number 1. The notation is slightly different (one uses explicit enumeration while the other uses set-builder notation), but they describe identical sets.
