noncomputable abbrev P2006AMCA_15_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2006AMCA_15
: sInf {z : ℝ | ∃ x : ℝ, Real.cos x = 0 ∧ Real.cos (x + z) = 1 / 2} = P2006AMCA_15_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: π / 3. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 48, which is at "π / 3" in "noncomputable abbrev P2006AMCA_15_answer : ℝ := π / 3", there is an error: unknown identifier 'π'.
. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Explanation:  
In mathlib, the constant π is defined as `Real.pi` (or `real.pi` after opening Real), not just `π`. We can fix the identifier by writing `Real.pi / 3`. This resolves the unknown identifier error. Since the problem involves cosines and angles, π/3 is a reasonable minimal positive shift z with the given cosine conditions.

Final corrected Lean expression:

<<<Real.pi / 3>>>
