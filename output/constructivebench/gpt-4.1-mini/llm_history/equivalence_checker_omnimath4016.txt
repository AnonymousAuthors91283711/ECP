Ground Truth Answer: {110, 143, 242, 341, 440, 164, 263, 362, 461, 560, 198, 297, 396, 495, 594, 693, 792, 891, 990}
Proposed Answer: {n | 100 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 999 ∧ ∃ k : ℕ, n + (n % 10 * 100 + (n / 10 % 10) * 10 + n / 100) = k * k}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is a set comprehension that exactly matches the condition specified in the problem statement. The ground truth answer lists all the specific numbers that satisfy this condition. Since the proposed answer defines the set using the exact same condition that produces the ground truth numbers, they are equivalent representations of the same set. The proposed answer is just the more general form, while the ground truth shows the explicit enumeration.
