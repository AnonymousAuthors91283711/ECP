Ground Truth Answer: 28
Proposed Answer: 24
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer step by step:

1. Total games = 60
2. Games per pair = 60 / 3 = 20 (since there are 3 pairs)
3. Calculations:
   - Alvin vs Bingyi: 20 games
     - Alvin wins 20% = 4 games
     - Bingyi wins 16 games
   - Bingyi vs Cheska: 20 games
     - Bingyi wins 60% = 12 games
     - Cheska wins 8 games
   - Cheska vs Alvin: 20 games
     - Cheska wins 40% = 8 games
     - Alvin wins 12 games

4. Total Bingyi wins:
   - From AB: 16
   - From BC: 12
   - From CA: (20 - 8) = 12 (but this is actually Alvin's wins, not Bingyi's)
   - Wait, the calculation in the theorem is incorrect here. The last term should be 0 since Bingyi doesn't play in CA games.

The correct calculation should be:
Bingyi_wins = (AB - Alvin_wins_AB) + Bingyi_wins_BC = 16 + 12 = 28

The proposed answer of 24 incorrectly includes (cheska_alvin - cheska_wins_ca) in Bingyi's wins, when these are actually Alvin's wins against Cheska.

<<<False>>>
