abbrev omnimath112_answer : ℚ → ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath112 (f : ℚ → ℚ) :
  (∀ x y, f (2 * x * y + 1/2) + f (x - y) = 4 * f x * f y + 1/2) ↔ f = omnimath112_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => x^2 + 1/2
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℚ => (2 * x - 1) / 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is a functional equation asking to find all functions f: ℚ → ℚ satisfying the given condition.

2. The ground truth answer is f(x) = x² + 1/2.

3. The proposed answer is f(x) = (2x - 1)/4.

Let's test if the proposed solution satisfies the original equation:
Take x = 0, y = 0:
- LHS: f(1/2) + f(0) = (0)/4 + (-1)/4 = -1/4
- RHS: 4*f(0)*f(0) + 1/2 = 4*(1/4) + 1/2 = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2
LHS ≠ RHS, so the proposed solution doesn't satisfy the equation.

The ground truth solution does satisfy the equation (this can be verified by substitution).
