  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (2 : ℝ) / 2^n < (0.1 : ℝ)} olympiadbench2925_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 5
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n where:
   - n > 0
   - 2/(2^n) < 0.1

2. Let's evaluate the inequality:
   2/(2^n) < 0.1
   => 2^n > 20

3. Calculate powers of 2:
   - 2^4 = 16 (which is not > 20)
   - 2^5 = 32 (which is > 20)

4. The ground truth answer is 5, which is correct since:
   - At n=4, 16 < 20 (doesn't satisfy)
   - At n=5, 32 > 20 (first n that satisfies)

5. The proposed answer is 4, which is incorrect because 2^4 = 16 < 20.

The proposed answer fails to satisfy the inequality, while the ground truth answer correctly identifies the smallest n that satisfies the condition.
