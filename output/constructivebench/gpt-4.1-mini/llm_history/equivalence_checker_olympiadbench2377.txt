Ground Truth Answer: 27/64
Proposed Answer: (3 * (1/2)^4 : ℚ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the expected number of pairs of consecutive heads when flipping 3 fair coins. The formula sums over all possible outcomes (k heads) and counts expected consecutive heads pairs for each outcome.

2. The ground truth answer is 27/64, which is approximately 0.421875.

3. The proposed answer is 3*(1/2)^4 = 3/16 = 0.1875.

The two answers are numerically different (27/64 ≠ 3/16), and the proposed answer doesn't match the correct calculation for this problem.
