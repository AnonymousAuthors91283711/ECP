Ground Truth Answer: 18
Proposed Answer: 36
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the sum of all positive integers n where the expression 9√n + 4√(n+2) - 3√(n+16) evaluates to an integer.

2. The ground truth answer is 18, which suggests there are likely two values of n (since 18 is a small number) that satisfy the condition and sum to 18.

3. The proposed answer is 36, which is exactly double the ground truth answer. This suggests the solver might have either:
   - Found the same solutions but counted them twice
   - Included some invalid solutions
   - Made an error in calculation

4. Without seeing the detailed solution steps, but knowing that 36 is exactly double 18, it's likely the solver made an error in counting or included invalid cases.

Since the answers differ by a factor of 2 and the ground truth is known to be correct, the proposed answer is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
