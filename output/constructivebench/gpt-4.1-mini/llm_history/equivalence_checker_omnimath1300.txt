Ground Truth Answer: 10812
Proposed Answer: List.range 233 |>.filter (fun n => 0 < n ∧ n % 2 = 0 ∧ n % 10 ≠ 0) |>.sum
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both expressions are filtering the numbers from 1 to 232 (List.range 233 gives numbers from 0 to 232), keeping only those that are positive, even, and not divisible by 10, then summing them. The conditions are expressed differently but are mathematically equivalent:
- `n > 0` vs `0 < n` (same)
- `Even n` vs `n % 2 = 0` (same)
- `¬(10 ∣ n)` vs `n % 10 ≠ 0` (same)
The sum of these numbers is indeed 10812.
