abbrev omnimath4079_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath4079 :
  {xyz : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ | let (x, y, z) := xyz; 2 ^ x + 9 * 7 ^ y = z ^ 3} = omnimath4079_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 1, 4)}
Proposed Answer: { xyz | let (x,y,z) := xyz; y = 0 ∧ x % 3 = 0 ∧ z = 2^(x / 3) }
<<<False>>>
