Ground Truth Answer: {t : ℝ × ℝ × ℝ | t = (0, 1, 1) ∨ t = (0, -1, -1) ∨ t = (1, 0, 1) ∨ t = (-1, 0, -1) ∨ t = (1, 1, 0) ∨ t = (-1, -1, 0) ∨ t = (1 / Real.sqrt 3, 1 / Real.sqrt 3, 1 / Real.sqrt 3) ∨ t = (-1 / Real.sqrt 3, -1 / Real.sqrt 3, -1 / Real.sqrt 3)}
Proposed Answer: { t : ℝ × ℝ × ℝ | let (a,b,c) := t; (a = b ∧ b = c ∧ 3 * a ^ 2 = 1) ∨ (a + b + c = 0 ∧ a ^ 3 = b ^ 3 ∧ b ^ 3 = c ^ 3) }
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. The ground truth lists specific points:
   - (0,1,1) and permutations with signs
   - (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3) and its negative

2. The proposed answer has two cases:
   - a=b=c ∧ 3a²=1 → gives exactly (1/√3,1/√3,1/√3) and negative
   - a+b+c=0 ∧ a³=b³=c³ → gives cases where two variables are equal and third is negative (like (1,1,-2)) but also cases like (0,1,-1)

The proposed answer includes more solutions than the ground truth:
- It correctly captures the symmetric (1/√3) cases
- But the second condition allows solutions like (1,1,-2) which don't satisfy the original equations
- It misses the specific (0,1,1) type solutions from the ground truth

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
