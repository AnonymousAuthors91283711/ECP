open Int

abbrev omnimath3200_answer : ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath3200 (n : ℤ) : 5 * (n - 2) = 85 ↔ n = omnimath3200_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 19
Proposed Answer: 17
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation given is: 5 * (n - 2) = 85
2. To solve for n:
   - First divide both sides by 5: n - 2 = 17
   - Then add 2 to both sides: n = 19

The ground truth answer correctly solves the equation to get n = 19.
The proposed answer gives n = 17, which is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the original equation (5*(17-2) = 75 ≠ 85).

<<<False>>>
