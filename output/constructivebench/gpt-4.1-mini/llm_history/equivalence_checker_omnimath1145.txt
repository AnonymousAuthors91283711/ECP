Ground Truth Answer: 2215
Proposed Answer: 3 ^ 91
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a strictly increasing function f: ℕ → ℕ with specific properties:
   - f(1) = 1
   - A recursive relation for even and odd inputs
   - The function is strictly increasing

2. The ground truth answer gives a specific value f(137) = 2215

3. The proposed answer suggests f(137) = 3^91, which is an extremely large number (approximately 2.6 × 10^43)

The proposed answer cannot be correct because:
- It violates the strictly increasing condition (f(137) would be astronomically larger than f(136))
- It doesn't match the ground truth value
- The recursive relation given in the problem would not produce such exponential growth

<<<False>>>
