The error originates because `f` is undefined in the current context. The problem cannot be solved nor simplified without knowing what the function `f` is. 

Since you only provided the sum expression and no definition for `f`, the only way to proceed is if you provide the definition or formula for `f`. 

Please provide the function `f : ℕ → ℕ` so that the sum can be computed or simplified into a closed form.

If `f` is some specific function, you can then try to find a closed form for ∑_{n=16}^{300} f n and assign that to `P2024HMMTnov_team_10_answer`.

Without `f`, the best I can do is suggest you first define `f`.

If `f` was already defined in your environment, please ensure it is imported correctly or that you provide a local definition.

Since no definition of `f` is given, I cannot write a closed form for the sum.

---

For example, if `f n = n` (just a placeholder guess), then the sum is the sum of integers from 16 to 300:
∑_{16}^{300} n = (300 * 301) / 2 - (15 * 16) / 2 = 45150 - 120 = 45030

In Lean, the closed form would be:
`(300 * 301) / 2 - (15 * 16) / 2`

But this is only a guess.

---

**To illustrate the format required and provide a "final answer" that compiles in Lean, let's assume for demonstration `f n = n` and write the closed form:**

The error indicates that `f` is not defined, so Lean does not know how to interpret `f n`. To fix this, you must define `f`. Given your proposed final answer is just the sum of integers from 16 to 300, it suggests `f n = n`.

The sum ∑ n=16 to 300 n = (1+2+...+300) - (1+2+...+15) = (300*301)/2 - (15*16)/2

So the final answer should be:

```lean
(300 * 301) / 2 - (15 * 16) / 2
```

and `f n` should be defined as `n`.

Hence:

- Define `f : ℕ → ℕ := id` or `f n := n`
- Then define `P2024HMMTnov_team_10_answer` as the sum above.

Since the problem's required final answer is just `P2024HMMTnov_team_10_answer : ℕ` closed form, we can give just the final value expression.
