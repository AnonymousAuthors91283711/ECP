Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a quadratic function f(x) = ax² + bx + c with integer coefficients.
2. We know f(1) = 0, which gives us one equation: a + b + c = 0.
3. We have bounds for f(7) and f(8):
   - 50 < f(7) < 60 → 50 < 49a + 7b + c < 60
   - 70 < f(8) < 80 → 70 < 64a + 8b + c < 80
4. Using f(1) = 0 (c = -a - b), we can rewrite the inequalities:
   - 50 < 48a + 6b < 60
   - 70 < 63a + 7b < 80
5. Solving these inequalities leads to a unique solution where a = 1, b = 2, c = -3.
6. Therefore, f(x) = x² + 2x - 3.
7. Now f(100) = 10000 + 200 - 3 = 10197.
8. We need to find k such that 5000k < 10197 < 5000(k+1).
   - For k=2: 10000 < 10197 < 15000 (true)
   - For k=3: 15000 < 10197 < 20000 (false)
   - The correct k is 2, not 3 or 9.

However, the ground truth answer is given as 3, which appears incorrect based on this calculation. The proposed answer of 9 is even further from the correct value.

<<<False>>>
