Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => (sin (2 * x) / sin (2 * y)) + (cos (2 * x) / cos (2 * y))
Proposed Answer: fun x y => (3 + 1/2) / (1 + 3 * (1/2))
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives two trigonometric ratios (sin x/sin y = 3 and cos x/cos y = 1/2) and asks for an expression involving x and y that simplifies to a rational number p/q where p+q=107.

2. The ground truth answer uses double-angle identities to create an expression that can be simplified using the given ratios.

3. The proposed answer suggests a simple arithmetic combination of the given ratios (3 + 1/2)/(1 + 3*(1/2)) = (3.5)/(2.5) = 7/5 = 1.4, which would make p+q=12, not 107.

The proposed answer:
- Doesn't use trigonometric identities
- Doesn't match the required p+q=107 condition
- Is a completely different approach from the ground truth
