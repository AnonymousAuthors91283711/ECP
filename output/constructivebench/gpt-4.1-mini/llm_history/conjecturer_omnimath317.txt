Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 67, which is at ", a * x + b / x }" in "abbrev omnimath317_answer : Set (ℝ → ℝ) := { f | ∃ a b : ℝ, f = λ x, a * x + b / x }", there is an error: unexpected token ','; expected '↦', '=>'.

The error arises because Lean expects a lambda expression to use `:=` or `↦` instead of `,` inside the set builder syntax. When defining a set of functions via lambda expressions inside a set, you need to use `↦` or `=>` after the variable.

Also, since the problem involves functions ℝ → ℝ, the answer suggests functions of the form `f x = a*x + b/x` for some real constants `a` and `b`.

The corrected Lean set expression should be:

```lean
{ f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a b : ℝ, ∀ x, f x = a * x + b / x }
```

This says: the set of functions `f` from ℝ to ℝ such that there exist real `a, b` with `f x = a x + b / x` for all `x`.

This fits the problem context and syntax for Lean.

Hence the corrected final answer is:

<<<{ f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a b : ℝ, ∀ x : ℝ, f x = a * x + b / x }>>>
