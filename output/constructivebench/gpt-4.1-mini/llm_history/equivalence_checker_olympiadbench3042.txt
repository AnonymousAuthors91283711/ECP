Ground Truth Answer: 7530
Proposed Answer: 14 * 985 + 15 * 14 / 2 * 1
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem asks for the greatest possible sum of a 15-term arithmetic sequence where:
1. Each term (a + k*d) ≤ 999 for k < 15
2. d is maximal (no larger common difference satisfies condition 1)
3. The sum is maximized under these constraints

The ground truth answer is 7530.

The proposed answer is:
14 * 985 + 15 * 14 / 2 * 1
= 13790 + 105
= 13895

This doesn't match the ground truth (7530). Moreover, the calculation itself seems incorrect as 14*985 is already 13790, which exceeds the maximum possible sum (15*999=14985), but the problem requires each term ≤999, not the sum.

The correct approach would be:
- Maximize d first (d=66)
- Then find largest a where a+14d≤999 → a=999-14*66=999-924=75
- Sum = 15*75 + (15*14/2)*66 = 1125 + 6930 = 8055 (but this exceeds the ground truth, suggesting the ground truth might have different constraints)

Given the discrepancy and incorrect calculation in the proposed answer:

<<<False>>>
