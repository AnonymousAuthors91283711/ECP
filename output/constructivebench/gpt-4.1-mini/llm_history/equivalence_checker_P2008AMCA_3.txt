abbrev P2008AMCA_3_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2008AMCA_3 : 
  (2/3 * 10 : ℚ) / 8 = (1/2 * 5 : ℚ) / P2008AMCA_3_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 4/3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is setting up an equation between two rational expressions:
   (2/3 * 10)/8 = (1/2 * 5)/x
   where x is the answer we're trying to find.

2. Simplifying both sides:
   Left side: (20/3)/8 = 20/24 = 5/6
   Right side: (5/2)/x = 5/(2x)

3. Setting them equal: 5/6 = 5/(2x)
   We can cancel the 5s: 1/6 = 1/(2x)
   Cross-multiplying: 2x = 6 → x = 3

The ground truth answer is indeed 3, while the proposed answer is 4/3. These are clearly different values.
