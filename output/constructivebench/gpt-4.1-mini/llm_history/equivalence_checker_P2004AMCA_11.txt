Ground Truth Answer: 0
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives two average value conditions for coins (pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters) and asks to find the number of dimes (d).

2. The ground truth answer is 0, meaning there are no dimes in the solution.

3. The proposed answer is 4, suggesting there are 4 dimes.

To check equivalence:
- The conditions represent average coin values before and after adding one quarter.
- For the averages to increase from 20 to 21 by adding one quarter (25 cents), the original configuration must be carefully balanced.
- The ground truth answer (0) suggests that the solution involves only pennies, nickels and quarters in specific quantities that satisfy both equations.
- The proposed answer (4) would require different quantities that also satisfy both equations, but this contradicts the ground truth.

Since the answers are clearly different (0 vs 4) and the ground truth is known to be correct, the proposed answer is incorrect.
