Ground Truth Answer: 108
Proposed Answer: 111
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a system of equations involving P2016AIMEII_1_answer (let's call it 'a'), b, c, r, d with multiple constraints.

2. The ground truth answer is 108, which satisfies all the given conditions when plugged into the equations.

3. The proposed answer is 111. Let's check if this could work:
   - From b = a*r and c = a*r², we see b and c form a geometric sequence with ratio r.
   - The sum a + b + c = 444 would become 111 + b + c = 444 ⇒ b + c = 333
   - For integer r, the smallest possible r is 2 (since b > a ⇒ r ≥ 2):
     - If r=2: b=222, c=444 ⇒ sum is 111+222+444=777≠444
     - If r=3: b=333, c=999 ⇒ sum exceeds 444
   - No integer r satisfies the conditions with a=111.
