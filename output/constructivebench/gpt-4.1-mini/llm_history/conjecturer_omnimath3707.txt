Explanation:  
The provided candidate answer has syntax errors and logical issues. In Lean set notation, variables quantified inside conditions must be explicitly introduced with `∃`. Also, multiplication should be explicitly written as `x * y * z = 0`, and you cannot use undeclared variables like `x` and `y` without quantifiers. Additionally, the union of two sets should be clearly written with proper `∃` quantifiers.

The problem is to characterize all triples \((a,b,c) \in \mathbb{N}^3\) such that \(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} + \sqrt{c} = \sqrt{2014}\). Squaring both sides and imposing non-negativity implies that \(\sqrt{a}, \sqrt{b}, \sqrt{c}\) are nonnegative integers \(x,y,z\) satisfying \(x + y + z = 2014\), and \(a = x^2\), \(b = y^2\), \(c = z^2\).

The original answer attempted to describe the set by splitting into two parts based on zero coordinates, but the union is redundant — the final characterization is simply:

\[
\{ (a,b,c) \mid \exists x,y,z \in \mathbb{N}, a = x^2 \wedge b = y^2 \wedge c = z^2 \wedge x + y + z = 2014 \}
\]

This is a proper closed form,  easy to state and free of syntactic errors.

Hence, the corrected Lean expression is a set of triples \((a,b,c)\) such that there exist natural numbers \(x,y,z\) with \(a=x^2, b=y^2, c=z^2\), and \(x+y+z=2014\).
