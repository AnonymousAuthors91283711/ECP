Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 1 / x
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℚ => x ^ 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The functional equation given is: ∀ x y : ℚ, 0 < x → 0 < y → f (f x^2 * y) = x^3 * f (x * y)

2. Ground truth answer: f(x) = 1/x
   - Let's verify: f(f(x)² * y) = f((1/x)² * y) = f(y/x²) = x²/y
   - Right side: x³ * f(x*y) = x³ * (1/(x*y)) = x²/y
   - Both sides equal, so this solution works

3. Proposed answer: f(x) = x³
   - Let's verify: f(f(x)² * y) = f((x³)² * y) = f(x⁶y) = (x⁶y)³ = x¹⁸y³
   - Right side: x³ * f(x*y) = x³ * (x*y)³ = x³ * x³y³ = x⁶y³
   - x¹⁸y³ ≠ x⁶y³, so this solution doesn't satisfy the equation

The proposed answer clearly doesn't satisfy the given functional equation, while the ground truth answer does. They are not equivalent.
