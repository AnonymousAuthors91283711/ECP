Ground Truth Answer: 4097
Proposed Answer: 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n where the fractional part of (√n)^(1/4) is strictly between 0 and 1/2015.

2. The ground truth answer is 4097. This makes sense because:
   - (√4097)^(1/4) ≈ 8.00006
   - The fractional part is about 0.00006, which is indeed between 0 and 1/2015 (≈0.000496)

3. The proposed answer is 1:
   - (√1)^(1/4) = 1
   - The fractional part is exactly 0, which doesn't satisfy the condition of being > 0

The proposed answer (1) clearly doesn't satisfy the problem's conditions, while the ground truth answer (4097) does. They are not equivalent.
