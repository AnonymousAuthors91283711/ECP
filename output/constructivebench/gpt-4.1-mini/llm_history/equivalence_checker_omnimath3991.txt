    (2*cake_price + 2*bagel_price = omnimath3991_answer * cupcake_price) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 13/4
Proposed Answer: 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem sets up a system of 3 equations with 3 variables (cake_price, cupcake_price, bagel_price) and asks to find the value of omnimath3991_answer that satisfies all equations.

2. From the first equation: 
1*cake_price + 2*cupcake_price + 3*bagel_price = 3*cake_price + 1*bagel_price
Simplifies to: 2*cupcake_price + 2*bagel_price = 2*cake_price
Or: cupcake_price + bagel_price = cake_price

3. From the second equation:
3*cake_price + 1*bagel_price = 6*cupcake_price
Using substitution from first equation (cake_price = cupcake_price + bagel_price):
3*(cupcake_price + bagel_price) + bagel_price = 6*cupcake_price
Simplifies to: 3*cupcake_price + 4*bagel_price = 6*cupcake_price
Or: 4*bagel_price = 3*cupcake_price
Thus: bagel_price = (3/4)*cupcake_price

4. Now substitute back into first simplified equation:
cupcake_price + (3/4)*cupcake_price = cake_price
Thus: cake_price = (7/4)*cupcake_price

5. Now examine the third equation:
2*cake_price + 2*bagel_price = omnimath3991_answer * cupcake_price
Substitute known relationships:
2*(7/4)*cupcake_price + 2*(3/4)*cupcake_price = omnimath3991_answer * cupcake_price
Simplifies to: (14/4 + 6/4)*cupcake_price = omnimath3991_answer * cupcake_price
Or: (20/4)*cupcake_price = omnimath3991_answer * cupcake_price
Thus: omnimath3991_answer = 5

The ground truth answer is 13/4 (3.25) while the proposed answer is 3. Neither matches our calculation of 5, but the proposed answer is closer to our calculation than the ground truth. However, both are incorrect based on our derivation.
