Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: 1.5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the least positive real number t where sin(πt - π/2) = -1.

2. The equation sin(πt - π/2) = -1 can be rewritten using trigonometric identities:
   sin(πt - π/2) = -cos(πt) = -1 ⇒ cos(πt) = 1

3. The general solution for cos(πt) = 1 is πt = 2πn for integer n ⇒ t = 2n

4. The smallest positive solution occurs when n=1 ⇒ t=2

5. The proposed answer is 1.5, but:
   cos(π*1.5) = cos(3π/2) = 0 ≠ 1

6. The ground truth answer is 2, which satisfies:
   cos(π*2) = cos(2π) = 1

The proposed answer (1.5) does not satisfy the equation, while the ground truth answer (2) does. They are not equivalent.
