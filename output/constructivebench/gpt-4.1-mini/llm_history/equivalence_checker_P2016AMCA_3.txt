Ground Truth Answer: fun (a, b) => a - b * (Int.floor (a / b))
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℚ × ℚ => p.1 + p.2 / 4
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem is asking for a function that takes a pair of rational numbers (a, b) and returns a rational number. We're given a specific test case where the function should return -1/40 when given (3/8, -2/5).

2. The ground truth answer is a function that computes a - b * floor(a/b). This is a well-known operation that computes the remainder/modulo operation for rational numbers.

3. The proposed answer is a completely different function that simply adds p.1 (first element) to p.2/4 (second element divided by 4).

Let's test both functions with the given input (3/8, -2/5):

Ground truth:
a = 3/8, b = -2/5
a/b = (3/8)/(-2/5) = -15/16
floor(-15/16) = -1
So a - b*floor(a/b) = 3/8 - (-2/5)*(-1) = 3/8 - 2/5 = -1/40 ✓

Proposed answer:
p.1 + p.2/4 = 3/8 + (-2/5)/4 = 3/8 - 1/10 = 7/40 ≠ -1/40

The proposed answer gives a different result and is clearly not equivalent to the ground truth.
