Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ (c k : ℝ), (StrictMono f ∨ StrictAnti f) ∧ 
    (∀ x > 0, f x = c * log x) ∨ (∀ x > 0, f x = c * x ^ k)}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ (a b : ℝ), a ≠ 0 ∧ ((f = fun x => a * Real.log x + b) ∨ 
  ∃ (n : ℕ), n ≥ 1 ∧ f = fun x => a * x ^ n + b) }
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. The ground truth answer captures two cases:
   - Logarithmic functions: f(x) = c*log(x)
   - Power functions: f(x) = c*x^k
   Both must be strictly monotone or strictly antitone.

2. The proposed answer has:
   - Logarithmic case: f(x) = a*log(x) + b
   - Power case: f(x) = a*x^n + b (with n being a natural number ≥1)
   Both must have a≠0 (which ensures strict monotonicity/antitonicity)

Key differences:
1. The ground truth allows any real exponent k, while the proposed answer restricts to natural numbers n≥1
2. The ground truth doesn't have the +b term in the function definitions
3. The ground truth explicitly states the strict monotonicity condition, while the proposed answer implies it through a≠0

The +b term doesn't affect the functional equation f(x*y) = ... since it cancels out, but it does affect strict monotonicity. The restriction to natural exponents is a significant limitation compared to the ground truth.
