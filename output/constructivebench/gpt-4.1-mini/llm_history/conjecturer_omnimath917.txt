<<<2002^(2002)>>>

Explanation: Each f(i) ∈ {1,…,2002}, with the constraint |f(i) - f(i+1)| ≤ 2 around a cycle. Since the range and allowed difference are equal to the size, the only global constraint is the domain size and values per element. The maximal number matches all functions from Fin 2002 to {1,...,2002}, hence 2002^2002.
