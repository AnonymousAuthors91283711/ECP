Ground Truth Answer: 820
Proposed Answer: 90
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a sequence a(n) = 10 + (n-1)*d and asks to find a natural number d such that:
   - a(a(2)) = 100
   - a(a(a(3))) equals some value (which the ground truth says is 820)

2. Let's solve for d:
   - First condition: a(2) = 10 + (2-1)*d = 10 + d
   - Then a(a(2)) = a(10+d) = 10 + (10+d-1)*d = 10 + (9+d)*d = 100
   - This gives us the equation: d² + 9d - 90 = 0
   - Solutions: d = 6 or d = -15 (but d must be natural, so d=6)

3. Now check the second condition with d=6:
   - a(3) = 10 + 2*6 = 22
   - a(a(3)) = a(22) = 10 + 21*6 = 136
   - a(a(a(3))) = a(136) = 10 + 135*6 = 820

The ground truth answer (820) matches our calculation when d=6. The proposed answer (90) doesn't match either the value of d or the final result.
