Ground Truth Answer: (-11 - 4 * Complex.I) / 3
Proposed Answer: -(1 + Complex.I) * (-1 + Complex.I)
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer: (-11 - 4 * Complex.I) / 3
   - This simplifies to -11/3 - (4/3)*Complex.I

2. Proposed Answer: -(1 + Complex.I) * (-1 + Complex.I)
   - Let's expand this:
     = -[(1)*(-1) + (1)*(Complex.I) + (Complex.I)*(-1) + (Complex.I)*(Complex.I)]
     = -[-1 + Complex.I - Complex.I + Complex.I²]
     = -[-1 + (Complex.I - Complex.I) - 1] (since Complex.I² = -1)
     = -[-2] = 2

The proposed answer simplifies to 2, which is clearly different from the ground truth answer of -11/3 - (4/3)*Complex.I.
