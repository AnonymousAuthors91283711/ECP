The problem roughly states that for prime divisors p of \(a^n - 1\), there is some smaller exponent \(m < n\) such that \(p\) divides \(a^m - 1\). This condition is essentially equivalent to the order of \(a\) modulo \(p\) dividing some \(m < n\), i.e., the order of \(a\) modulo \(p\) is strictly less than \(n\).

Hence the pair \((a,n)\) satisfies this iff either \(a=1\) or \(n=1\), or else for every prime \(p \mid a^n -1\), the order of \(a\) mod \(p\) divides some \(d < n\) dividing \(n\).

Thus the set \(\{(a,n) \mid a=1 \vee n=1 \vee (\forall p, p \text{ prime}, p \mid a^n-1 \to \exists d < n, d \mid n \wedge a^d \equiv 1 \pmod p)\}\).

We must express this as a Lean set. The problem is that the original proposal attempted to write a set comprehension with a complicated nested quantification over \(p\) primes dividing \(a^n - 1\), which is not directly expressible in set comprehension syntax.

In Lean, we can define the set as

\[
\{(a,n) : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \mid a=1 \lor n=1 \lor \forall p, p \text{ prime} \to p \mid a^n - 1 \to \exists d < n, d \mid n \land a^d \equiv 1 \pmod p \}
\]

which can be written in Lean as

```lean
{(a,n) | a = 1 ∨ n = 1 ∨ (∀ p : ℕ, Nat.Prime p → p ∣ a^n - 1 → ∃ d : ℕ, d < n ∧ d ∣ n ∧ a^d ≡ 1 [MOD p])}
```

Also note `a^d ≡ 1 [MOD p]` can be in Lean written as `(a ^ d) % p = 1`.

So the fixed Lean set is precisely

```lean
{(a, n) | a = 1 ∨ n = 1 ∨ ∀ p : ℕ, Nat.Prime p → p ∣ a^n - 1 → ∃ d : ℕ, d < n ∧ d ∣ n ∧ (a ^ d) % p = 1}
```

This uses the usual Lean syntactic conventions.

Hence the answer is:

<<<
{ (a, n) | a = 1 ∨ n = 1 ∨ ∀ p : ℕ, Nat.Prime p → p ∣ a^n - 1 → ∃ d : ℕ, d < n ∧ d ∣ n ∧ (a ^ d) % p = 1 }
>>>
