<<<10^(36)>>>
Explanation: The expression simplifies by sequentially applying the exponents: (10^(9^2 - 9))^(1/9) = 10^(9 - 1) = 10^8, then raised to (1/2), then again (1/2) twice, resulting in 10^(8 * 1/2 * 1/2) = 10^2, check carefully the full chain: (10^(72))^(1/9) = 10^8; (10^8)^(1/2) = 10^4; (10^4)^(1/2) = 10^2, correcting the original. But we must follow the question carefully: The problem states (10^(9^2 - 9))^(1/9)^(1/2)^(1/2). This is interpreted as (((10^(72))^(1/9))^(1/2))^(1/2) = 10^(72 * 1/9 * 1/2 * 1/2) = 10^(72 * 1/36) = 10^2. Therefore, the final answer is 10^2, which is 100, not 10^36. So correcting the final answer accordingly:

<<<100>>>
