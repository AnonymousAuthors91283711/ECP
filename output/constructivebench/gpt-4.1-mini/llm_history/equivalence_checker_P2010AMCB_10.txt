Ground Truth Answer: 50 / 101
Proposed Answer: 50
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is solving for x in the equation:
   (sum from n=0 to 98 of (n+1) + x)/101 = 100x

2. The sum from n=0 to 98 of (n+1) is the same as sum from k=1 to 99 of k, which equals 99*100/2 = 4950

3. So the equation becomes: (4950 + x)/101 = 100x
   => 4950 + x = 10100x
   => 4950 = 10099x
   => x = 4950/10099 = 50/101 (after simplifying by dividing numerator and denominator by 99)

The ground truth answer is 50/101 (exact value), while the proposed answer is 50 (approximate decimal value). These are not equivalent.
