Ground Truth Answer: {19}
Proposed Answer: {2, 19}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all prime numbers p where there exists an integer k such that k³ = p² - p + 1.

2. Ground truth answer is {19}, meaning only 19 satisfies this condition.

3. Proposed answer is {2, 19}, claiming both 2 and 19 satisfy the condition.

Let's test p = 2:
k³ = 2² - 2 + 1 = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3
But 3 is not a perfect cube (1³ = 1, 2³ = 8), so no integer k satisfies this for p=2.

Only p=19 works:
k³ = 19² - 19 + 1 = 361 - 19 + 1 = 343
7³ = 343, so k=7 satisfies this.

The proposed answer incorrectly includes 2, which doesn't satisfy the condition.
