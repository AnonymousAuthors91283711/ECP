Ground Truth Answer: (10^3, 10)
Proposed Answer: (10 ^ 5, 10 ^ 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves solving a system of logarithmic equations:
   - log₁₀(x³) + log₁₀(y²) = 11
   - log₁₀(x²) - log₁₀(y³) = 3

2. Simplifying the equations using logarithm properties:
   - First equation: 3log₁₀x + 2log₁₀y = 11
   - Second equation: 2log₁₀x - 3log₁₀y = 3

3. Solving this system:
   Let a = log₁₀x, b = log₁₀y
   - 3a + 2b = 11
   - 2a - 3b = 3
   Solving gives a = 3, b = 1
   Therefore x = 10³ = 1000, y = 10¹ = 10

4. Comparing answers:
   - Ground truth: (10³, 10) = (1000, 10)
   - Proposed: (10⁵, 10¹) = (100000, 10)

The x values don't match (1000 vs 100000), while the y values match. The proposed answer is incorrect for x.
