theorem P2005AMCA_1
(x y : ℝ)
(hxy : 2 = 0.1 * x ∧ 2 = 0.2 * y)
: x - y = P2005AMCA_1_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 10
Proposed Answer: 20
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. From the given conditions:
   - 2 = 0.1 * x ⇒ x = 2 / 0.1 = 20
   - 2 = 0.2 * y ⇒ y = 2 / 0.2 = 10

2. Therefore, x - y = 20 - 10 = 10

The ground truth answer is 10, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 20, which is incorrect as it doesn't match the calculated difference.

<<<False>>>
