Ground Truth Answer: 9 / 4
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two equations:
   - 1 = 1/4 * (2 + a)
   - 2 = 1/4 * (1 + b)

2. Let's solve for a and b:
   - For a: 1 = (2 + a)/4 → 4 = 2 + a → a = 2
   - For b: 2 = (1 + b)/4 → 8 = 1 + b → b = 7

3. Therefore, a + b = 2 + 7 = 9

4. The ground truth answer is 9/4, which is incorrect (should be 9)
5. The proposed answer is 4, which is also incorrect

However, the ground truth answer is mathematically wrong (should be 9), and the proposed answer is also wrong (4). But they're both wrong in different ways, so they're not equivalent.
