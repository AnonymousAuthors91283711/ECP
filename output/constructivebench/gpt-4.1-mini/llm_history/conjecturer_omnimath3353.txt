noncomputable abbrev omnimath3353_answer : ℂ := sorry
theorem omnimath3353 :
  2 * Complex.cos (Real.log 2009 * Complex.I) ^ 2 + Complex.I * Complex.sin (Real.log 4036081 * Complex.I) = omnimath3353_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℂ
<<<2 * Complex.exp (-Real.log 2009 * Complex.I)>>>
Explanation: Using Euler’s formula, cos² and sin terms with logarithms and imaginary unit simplify to complex exponentials. The expression equals 2e^{-i log 2009} = 2/(2009^i).
