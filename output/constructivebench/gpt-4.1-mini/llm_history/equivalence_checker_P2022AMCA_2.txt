Ground Truth Answer: 5
Proposed Answer: 24
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. We have three equations:
   - a + b + c = 96
   - a = 6c
   - c = b - 40

2. Substitute c from the third equation into the second equation:
   a = 6(b - 40) = 6b - 240

3. Substitute a and c in terms of b into the first equation:
   (6b - 240) + b + (b - 40) = 96
   8b - 280 = 96
   8b = 376
   b = 47

4. Now find c:
   c = b - 40 = 47 - 40 = 7

5. Find a:
   a = 6c = 6*7 = 42

6. Calculate |a - b|:
   |42 - 47| = 5

The ground truth answer is 5, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 24, which is incorrect.
