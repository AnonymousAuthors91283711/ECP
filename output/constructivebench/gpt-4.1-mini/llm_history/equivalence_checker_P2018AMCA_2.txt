Ground Truth Answer: 50
Proposed Answer: 14 * 3 + 11 * 0 + 2 * 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the maximum value of v = 14a + 11b + 2c under constraints:
   - a, b, c ≤ 20
   - 5a + 4b + c ≤ 18

2. Ground truth answer is 50, which can be achieved by:
   - a=3, b=0, c=0: 14*3 + 11*0 + 2*0 = 42 + 0 + 0 = 42 (not 50)
   - a=0, b=4, c=2: 14*0 + 11*4 + 2*2 = 0 + 44 + 4 = 48
   - a=1, b=3, c=1: 14*1 + 11*3 + 2*1 = 14 + 33 + 2 = 49
   - a=2, b=2, c=0: 14*2 + 11*2 + 2*0 = 28 + 22 + 0 = 50

3. The proposed answer gives 42 (14*3 + 11*0 + 2*0), which is less than the maximum 50.

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't achieve the maximum value under the given constraints.
