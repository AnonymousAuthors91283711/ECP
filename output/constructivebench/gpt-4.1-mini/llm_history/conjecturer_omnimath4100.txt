theorem omnimath4100 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∃ n, f n ≠ 0) ∧
  (∀ x y, f (x * y) = f x + f y) ∧
  (Set.Infinite {n | ∀ k < n, f k = f (n - k)}) ↔
  ∃ a p, p.Prime ∧ f = omnimath4100_answer a p := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun a p n => a * (p ^ n)>>>
Explanation: The given conditions force f to be an additive function over multiplication, thus f is logarithmic base p. The infinite symmetry condition implies f has the form a * p^n for prime p.
