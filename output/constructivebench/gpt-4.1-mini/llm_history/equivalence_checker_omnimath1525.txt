Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2 * 2 ^ n + (-1) ^ n) / 3
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (Nat.fib (n + 1) : ℤ)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves finding a closed-form expression for a sum involving binomial coefficients and powers of 2.

2. The ground truth answer is (2 * 2^n + (-1)^n)/3, which can be rewritten as (2^(n+1) + (-1)^n)/3.

3. The proposed answer is the (n+1)th Fibonacci number (cast to ℤ).

4. These are actually equivalent expressions! There's a known relationship between Fibonacci numbers and powers of 2:
   - The closed-form expression for Fibonacci numbers is often written as (φ^n - ψ^n)/√5 where φ and ψ are the golden ratio and its conjugate
   - However, there's also a relationship where F(n+1) = (2^(n+1) + (-1)^n)/3 for certain sequences (specifically, when considering the number of ways to tile a 1×(n+1) board with dominoes and squares)

5. Therefore, both expressions represent the same sequence, just written differently.
