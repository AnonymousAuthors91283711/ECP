theorem P2003AMCB_24 :
  IsLeast {c : ℕ | ∃ a b : ℕ, a < b ∧ b < c ∧ 
    ∃! (x : ℝ), x^2 + a^2 = 2^x + 2^a ∧ x^2 + b^2 = 2^x + 2^b ∧ x^2 + c^2 = 2^x + 2^c} 
  P2003AMCB_24_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<5>>> 
Explanation: From the conditions and uniqueness constraints, the smallest such c is 5, found by checking triples (a,b,c) with a < b < c that satisfy the unique x condition.
