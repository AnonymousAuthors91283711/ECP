Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n)! - 1
Proposed Answer: fun n => n * (2007 - (n - 1) / 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a polynomial P of degree 2008 with:
   - Leading coefficient 1
   - Evaluates to (2007 - i) at x = i for i = 0 to 2007

2. We need to find P(2008)

3. Ground truth answer suggests P(n) = n! - 1 (factorial minus one)

4. Proposed answer suggests P(n) = n*(2007 - (n-1)/2)

Analysis:
- The ground truth answer is correct because the polynomial Q(x) = x! - 1 satisfies all given conditions:
  * Degree is correct (factorial grows faster than any polynomial)
  * Q(i) = i! - 1 = 2007 - i for i=0 to 2007 (since 2008! is much larger)
  * Q(2008) = 2008! - 1

- The proposed answer is a linear function (degree 1) which cannot match the required degree 2008 polynomial
- The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the evaluation conditions either
