The error comes from using the identifier `a` without it being introduced by an `∃` quantifier or otherwise in scope. To fix this, we need to introduce `a` as an explicit quantified variable alongside `c`. 

Also, logically, the problem suggests polynomials of the form `a * (X - 1)^2 + c` where `a = 0`, which means the polynomial is just a constant polynomial `c`. So the final answer set should be the set of all constant polynomials.

Therefore, the correct expression should be

{ f : Polynomial ℤ | ∃ c : ℤ, f = c }

which is the set of constant polynomials with integer coefficients. This matches the condition that the polynomial must be constant (degree zero) so that the growth condition on p(eval(n^2, f)) holds.

If you want to stick to the given form (some `a` times `(X - 1)^2` plus a constant `c`), then you should quantify `a` too and require it be zero:

{ f : Polynomial ℤ | ∃ (a c : ℤ), f = a * (X - 1)^2 + c ∧ a = 0 }

but logically this is the same as just constant polynomials. So for clarity, I suggest the simpler form:

{ f : Polynomial ℤ | ∃ c : ℤ, f = c }

Expressed in Lean, `f = c` means `f` equals the constant polynomial `c`. You can write `Polynomial.C c` or just `c` since constants embed into polynomials via `C`.

Hence the corrected final answer is:

<<<{ f : Polynomial ℤ | ∃ c : ℤ, f = Polynomial.C c }>>>
