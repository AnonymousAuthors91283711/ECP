Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n - 1) * (-1) + (if n % 2 = 0 then 0 else (-1)^((n - 1) / 2))
Proposed Answer: fun n => if n = 1 then 1 else if n = 2 then 2 else if n = 3 then -1 else if n = 4 then 0 else 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for functions a and g that satisfy certain recurrence relations and initial conditions. The combined expression (a n + g n) is what we're evaluating.

2. The ground truth answer provides a general formula for (a n + g n) that:
   - Has a linear term (n-1)*(-1)
   - Has a periodic term based on parity and (n-1)/2

3. The proposed answer:
   - Only defines specific values for n=1 to 4
   - Gives a constant value (1) for all n>4
   - Doesn't match the ground truth's general pattern
   - Doesn't satisfy the recurrence relations implied by the problem

Key differences:
- The proposed answer doesn't provide a general formula
- It doesn't match the ground truth's values (e.g., at n=3, ground truth gives 1, proposed gives -1)
- It doesn't maintain the pattern seen in the ground truth
