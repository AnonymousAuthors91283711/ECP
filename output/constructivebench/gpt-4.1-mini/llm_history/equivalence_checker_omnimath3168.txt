Ground Truth Answer: 35 / 18
Proposed Answer: 9/4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have three equations:
   - x*y = 1/9
   - x*(y+1) = 7/9
   - y*(x+1) = 5/18

2. We can expand the second equation: x*y + x = 7/9 → 1/9 + x = 7/9 → x = 6/9 = 2/3

3. From x*y = 1/9 and x = 2/3, we get y = (1/9)/(2/3) = 1/6

4. Now we can compute (x+1)*(y+1):
   (2/3 + 1)*(1/6 + 1) = (5/3)*(7/6) = 35/18

The ground truth answer is 35/18, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 9/4, which is different from 35/18 (since 35/18 ≈ 1.944 and 9/4 = 2.25).
