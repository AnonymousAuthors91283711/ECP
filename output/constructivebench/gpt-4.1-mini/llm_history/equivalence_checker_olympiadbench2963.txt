Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 3 * (3 * 2)^(1 / 3)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. Given conditions:
   - T = 0 (from hT)
   - x + y = 0 ⇒ y = -x
   - x³ - y³ = 54 + T = 54 (since T=0)

2. Substituting y = -x into the cubic equation:
   x³ - (-x)³ = 54 ⇒ x³ + x³ = 54 ⇒ 2x³ = 54 ⇒ x³ = 27 ⇒ x = 3

3. The ground truth answer is indeed 3, which matches our derivation.

4. The proposed answer is 3 * (3 * 2)^(1/3), which simplifies to:
   3 * (6)^(1/3) ≈ 3 * 1.817 ≈ 5.451, which is clearly not equal to 3.

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth answer, and our derivation confirms that x should be exactly 3.
