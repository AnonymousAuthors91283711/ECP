    (Real.logb 6 (sqrt (x - 7))) + Real.logb (6^2) (x - 2) = 1 ↔ x = olympiadbench3022_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<196>>>

Explanation: Setting y = sqrt(x - 7), the equation becomes log₆(y) + log₃₆(x - 2) = 1. Using change of base and properties yields x=196.
