Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: 16
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for three distinct digits P, Q, R (each between 0 and 9) that satisfy the equation:
   (100P + 70 + R) + (300 + 90 + R) = 100R + 10Q + 0

2. Simplifying the equation:
   100P + 70 + R + 300 + 90 + R = 100R + 10Q
   100P + 460 + 2R = 100R + 10Q
   100P + 460 = 100R - 2R + 10Q
   100P + 460 = 98R + 10Q

3. The ground truth answer is 13, meaning P+Q+R=13 for the valid solution.

4. The proposed answer is 16, which would mean P+Q+R=16.

5. Let's find the actual solution:
   - Trying R=6: 100P + 460 = 588 + 10Q → 100P = 128 + 10Q → No integer P <10 works
   - Trying R=7: 100P + 460 = 686 + 10Q → 100P = 226 + 10Q → P=2, Q=2.6 → invalid
   - Trying R=8: 100P + 460 = 784 + 10Q → 100P = 324 + 10Q → P=3, Q=2.4 → invalid
   - Trying R=9: 100P + 460 = 882 + 10Q → 100P = 422 + 10Q → P=4, Q=2 → valid (P=4,Q=2,R=9)
   - Sum: 4+2+9=15 (not matching either answer)
   - Wait, this contradicts both answers. Maybe I made a calculation error.

6. Recalculating for R=6:
   100P + 460 = 588 + 10Q → 100P - 10Q = 128 → 10P - Q = 12.8 → invalid
   R=5: 100P + 460 = 490 + 10Q → 100P = 30 + 10Q → P=1, Q=7 → valid (P=1,Q=7,R=5)
   Sum: 1+7+5=13 (matches ground truth)

The ground truth answer (13) is correct for P=1, Q=7, R=5, while the proposed answer (16) is incorrect.
