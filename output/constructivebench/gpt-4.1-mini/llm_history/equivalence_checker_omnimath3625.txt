Ground Truth Answer: ∅
Proposed Answer: {(0, 0), (2, -2), (-2, 2)} ∪ {(k, 0) | k : ℤ} ∪ {(0, k) | k : ℤ}
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem asks for all integer pairs (m,n) that satisfy m⁵ - n⁵ = 16mn.

The ground truth answer is the empty set (∅), meaning there are no integer solutions.

The proposed answer suggests several solution sets:
1. (0,0)
2. (2,-2) and (-2,2)
3. All pairs where m=0 and n is any integer
4. All pairs where n=0 and m is any integer

Let's test some of these:
1. For (0,0): 0⁵-0⁵=0 and 16*0*0=0 → valid
2. For (2,-2): 32-(-32)=64 and 16*2*(-2)=-64 → not equal
3. For (k,0): k⁵-0⁵=k⁵ and 16*k*0=0 → only valid when k=0
4. For (0,k): similar to above, only valid when k=0

Only (0,0) is actually valid. The other proposed solutions either don't satisfy the equation or only satisfy it in trivial cases already covered by (0,0).

The ground truth answer says there are no solutions, which contradicts the valid (0,0) solution. However, the proposed answer contains many invalid solutions.

<<<False>>>
