Ground Truth Answer: 11
Proposed Answer: 196
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
We have the equation:
log₆(√(x-7)) + log₃₆(x-2) = 1

Ground Truth Answer: 11
Proposed Answer: 196

Verification:
1. For x=11:
   log₆(√(11-7)) + log₃₆(11-2) = log₆(2) + log₃₆(9)
   = log₆(2) + (log₆(9)/2) = log₆(2) + log₆(3) = log₆(6) = 1
   This satisfies the equation.

2. For x=196:
   log₆(√(196-7)) + log₃₆(196-2) = log₆(√189) + log₃₆(194)
   ≈ 2.82 + 1.28 ≈ 4.10 ≠ 1
   This doesn't satisfy the equation.

Conclusion:
The ground truth answer (11) is correct, while the proposed answer (196) is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
