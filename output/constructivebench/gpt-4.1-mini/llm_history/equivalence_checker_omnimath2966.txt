Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: (300/35 - (99/35 : ℕ) - (300/70 - (99/70 : ℕ)))
Let me analyze this problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem asks for the count of numbers between 100 and 300 (inclusive) that are:
   - Divisible by both 5 and 7 (i.e., divisible by 35)
   - Not divisible by 10

2. The ground truth answer is 3, which is correct because:
   - Numbers divisible by 35 in this range: 105, 140, 175, 210, 245, 280
   - Excluding those divisible by 10: 140, 210, 280
   - Remaining: 105, 175, 245 → 3 numbers

3. The proposed answer is a calculation:
   - First term (300/35 - 99/35) counts numbers divisible by 35
   - Second term (300/70 - 99/70) counts numbers divisible by 70 (both 35 and 10)
   - The subtraction gives numbers divisible by 35 but not by 70

4. The calculation works out to:
   - 300/35 = 8, 99/35 = 2 → 6
   - 300/70 = 4, 99/70 = 1 → 3
   - 6 - 3 = 3

The proposed answer's formula correctly represents the mathematical approach and gives the correct result of 3. The expression is equivalent to the ground truth answer when properly evaluated.
