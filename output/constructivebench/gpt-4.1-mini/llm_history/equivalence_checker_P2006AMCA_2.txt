abbrev P2006AMCA_2_answer : ℤ → ℤ := sorry
theorem P2006AMCA_2 (h : ℤ) :
    let tensor (x y : ℤ) := x^3 - y
    tensor h (tensor h h) = P2006AMCA_2_answer h := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun h => h
Proposed Answer: fun h : ℤ => h ^ 9 - h^3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a function `tensor(x,y) = x³ - y`
2. It asks to compute `tensor h (tensor h h)`
3. Let's compute step by step:
   - First compute inner `tensor h h = h³ - h`
   - Then compute `tensor h (h³ - h) = h³ - (h³ - h) = h³ - h³ + h = h`

The ground truth answer correctly simplifies to `h`, while the proposed answer gives `h⁹ - h³`, which is incorrect.
