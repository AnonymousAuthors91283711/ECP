Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: 24
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the count of natural numbers n (0 < n ≤ 20000) where:
   - The number of divisors of 2n is 64
   - The number of divisors of 5n is 60

2. The ground truth answer is 4, while the proposed answer is 24.

3. To evaluate this, we need to understand the divisor count conditions:
   - For 2n to have 64 divisors (64 = 2^6), n must have a specific prime factorization that when multiplied by 2 (which adds one prime factor) results in a product of exponents+1 equal to 64.
   - Similarly for 5n having 60 divisors (60 = 2^2×3×5).

4. The conditions are quite restrictive, and it's unlikely there would be 24 numbers satisfying both within 20000. The ground truth answer of 4 is more plausible for such specific divisor count requirements.

5. The proposed answer of 24 is significantly higher and likely incorrect for these constraints.
