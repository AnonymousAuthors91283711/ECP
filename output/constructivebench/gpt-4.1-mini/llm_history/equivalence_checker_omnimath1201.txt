Ground Truth Answer: 25 / 9
Proposed Answer: (25 - sqrt (25 * 25 - 4 * 10 * 25)) / 20
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum of the minimum pairwise products (a*b, b*c, c*a) under the constraints:
   - a, b, c > 0
   - a + b + c = 10
   - ab + bc + ca = 25

2. The ground truth answer is 25/9 ≈ 2.777...

3. The proposed answer is (25 - √(25² - 4*10*25))/20

Let's simplify the proposed answer:
√(625 - 1000) = √(-375) → This is already problematic as we have a negative under the square root.

But let's assume it's a typo and should be √(25² - 4*9*25) = √(625 - 900) = √(-275) → still negative.

Alternatively, if we consider the correct discriminant for the quadratic that would appear in solving this problem, it should be 25² - 4*10*25 = -375, which is still negative.

The proposed answer leads to a complex number, which doesn't make sense in this real-valued optimization problem. The ground truth answer 25/9 is correct and can be obtained by considering the symmetric case a = b = c (though they can't be exactly equal here, but approach this value).
