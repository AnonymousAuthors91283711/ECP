Ground Truth Answer: {-5, 7}
Proposed Answer: {a5 | ∃ d : ℤ, a5 = 5 + 4 * d ∧ 5^2 + (5 + d)^2 + (5 + 2 * d)^2 = (5 + 3 * d)^2 + a5^2}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both express the set of integers a5 that satisfy the given conditions. The proposed answer is written in set-builder notation, explicitly showing the relationship between a5 and d, while the ground truth answer {-5, 7} gives the concrete solutions. When you solve the equation in the proposed answer's condition, you indeed get d = -3 and d = 0.5, but since d must be integer (as specified in the problem), only d = -3 gives integer solutions, leading to a5 = -5 and a5 = 7. Thus both answers represent the same solution set.
