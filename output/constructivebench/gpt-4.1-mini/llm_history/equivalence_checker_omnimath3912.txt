Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | ∃ k, n = 3 * k ∧ k ≥ 1}
Proposed Answer: {n | ∃ m : ℕ, n = m + 3}
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground truth: All natural numbers that are multiples of 3 (n = 3k where k ≥ 1)
Proposed answer: All natural numbers ≥ 3 (n = m + 3 where m is any natural number)

These are not equivalent because:
1. The ground truth includes only multiples of 3 (3, 6, 9, ...)
2. The proposed answer includes all numbers ≥3 (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ...)

For example:
- 4 is in the proposed answer but not in the ground truth
- 6 is in both
- 7 is in the proposed answer but not in the ground truth
