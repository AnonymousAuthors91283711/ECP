Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1, 1, 1), (-1, -1, -1, -1)}
Proposed Answer: {(x, y, z, w) : ℝ × ℝ × ℝ × ℝ | x ≠ 0 ∧ y ≠ 0 ∧ z ≠ 0 ∧ w ≠ 0 ∧
  x = y ∧ y = z ∧ z = w ∧
  x ^ 4 = 1}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a system of cyclic equations where each variable is related to the next in the same way.

2. The ground truth answer gives two specific solutions: (1,1,1,1) and (-1,-1,-1,-1).

3. The proposed answer describes a set where:
   - All variables are non-zero
   - All variables are equal (x=y=z=w)
   - x^4 = 1 (which implies x=1 or x=-1)

The proposed answer is actually more general than the ground truth answer, but when we consider the constraints:
- x^4=1 gives x=1 or x=-1 (since we're in ℝ)
- Combined with x=y=z=w, this gives exactly the two solutions in the ground truth answer

Therefore, the answers are equivalent. The proposed answer might appear more general at first glance, but when fully analyzed, it reduces to exactly the same solution set as the ground truth.
