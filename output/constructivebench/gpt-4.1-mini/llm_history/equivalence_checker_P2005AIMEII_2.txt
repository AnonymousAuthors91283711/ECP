Ground Truth Answer: (6, 79)
Proposed Answer: (6 * (factorial 3)^3, choose 9 3 * choose 6 3 * choose 3 3)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about calculating a probability (favorable/total) in reduced form.

2. Ground truth gives the reduced form (6,79)

3. Proposed answer gives the unreduced form (6*(3!)^3, C(9,3)*C(6,3)*C(3,3))

Calculating the proposed answer:
- 6*(3!)^3 = 6*6^3 = 6*216 = 1296
- C(9,3)*C(6,3)*C(3,3) = 84*20*1 = 1680

Now reduce 1296/1680:
- GCD(1296,1680) = 48
- 1296/48 = 27
- 1680/48 = 35
- Reduced form is 27/35, not 6/79

The proposed answer gives the unreduced numerator and denominator, while the ground truth gives the reduced form. They are not equivalent.
