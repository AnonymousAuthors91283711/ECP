Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: 97
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves finding natural numbers m and n such that √(7 + √48) = m + √n, with m,n > 0.

2. Let's solve the equation:
   √(7 + √48) = m + √n
   Square both sides:
   7 + √48 = m² + n + 2m√n

3. This gives us two equations:
   a) m² + n = 7
   b) 2m√n = √48 → 4m²n = 48 → m²n = 12

4. Possible integer solutions where m,n > 0:
   - m=1: n=12 → 1 + 12 = 13 ≠ 7 (fails first equation)
   - m=2: n=3 → 4 + 3 = 7 (satisfies both equations)

5. Therefore, the correct solution is m=2, n=3
   m² + n² = 4 + 9 = 13

The ground truth answer is correct (13), while the proposed answer (97) is incorrect.
