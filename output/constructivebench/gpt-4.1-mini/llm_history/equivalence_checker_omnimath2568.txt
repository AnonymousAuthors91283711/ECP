open Set Function Nat

abbrev omnimath2568_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2568 : 
  Infinite omnimath2568_answer ∧ ∀ a ∈ omnimath2568_answer, ∀ b ∈ omnimath2568_answer, a < b → Squarefree (a + b) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: sorry  -- The actual construction is non-trivial
Proposed Answer: { n : ℕ | n % 3 = 0 ∧ Squarefree n }
<<<False>>>
