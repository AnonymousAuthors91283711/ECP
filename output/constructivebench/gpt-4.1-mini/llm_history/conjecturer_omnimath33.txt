Explanation: The divisibility and positivity conditions characterize exactly functions of the form f(x) = c*x with c > 0.. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 41, which is at " <<<{ f | ∃ c : ℕ, c" in "abbrev omnimath33_answer : Set (ℕ → ℕ) := <<<{ f | ∃ c : ℕ, c > 0 ∧ f = fun x => c * x }>><<<", there is an error: unexpected token '<<<'; expected term.

<<<{ f : ℕ → ℕ | ∃ c : ℕ, c > 0 ∧ ∀ x, f x = c * x }>>> 

Explanation: The condition ∀ x y, f(f x + y) ∣ x + f y along with f x > 0 strongly suggests f is multiplicative and linear, i.e., f(x) = c * x for some positive integer c. The set of such functions f is exactly those for which there exists c > 0 with f x = c * x. This matches the enumerated patterns and fits the problem's constraints logically.
