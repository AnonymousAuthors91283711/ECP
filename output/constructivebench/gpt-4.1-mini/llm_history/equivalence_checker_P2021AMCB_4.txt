abbrev P2021AMCB_4_answer : â„š := sorry
theorem P2021AMCB_4 : 
  (3 * 84 + 4 * 70) / 7 = P2021AMCB_4_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 76
Proposed Answer: (3 * 84 + 4 * 70) / 7
Let's evaluate the proposed answer step by step:

1. Calculate numerator: 3*84 + 4*70 = 252 + 280 = 532
2. Divide by denominator: 532 / 7 = 76

The ground truth answer is 76, and the proposed answer simplifies to 76. Therefore, they are equivalent.
