Ground Truth Answer: 9 / sqrt 23
Proposed Answer: Real.sqrt 3 + Real.sqrt (8 / 3) + Real.sqrt (15 / 4) - 3
Let me analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

1. First, let's compute the numerical values:
   - Ground truth: 9/√23 ≈ 9/4.79583 ≈ 1.87689
   - Proposed answer: √3 + √(8/3) + √(15/4) - 3 ≈ 1.73205 + 1.63299 + 1.93649 - 3 ≈ 2.30153

2. The numerical values are significantly different (1.87689 vs 2.30153), so they cannot be equivalent.

3. The proposed answer appears to be a sum of square roots minus 3, which doesn't match the form of the ground truth answer (a simple fraction with square root in denominator).

4. There's no obvious algebraic manipulation that would make these expressions equivalent.
