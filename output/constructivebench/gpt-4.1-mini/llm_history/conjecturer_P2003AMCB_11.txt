  ∀ t, watchTime t = 22 → t ≥ solution := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<(12 + (60 / 57.6) * 10)>>>
Explanation: The watch runs slow at a rate 57.6 min per 60 min actual, implying time t maps to (t-12)*(57.6/60)+12. To find t where watch reads 22, solve 22 = (t-12)*(57.6/60)+12 → t = 12 + (60/57.6)*10. This is minimal such t.
