Explanation:
The error arises because `I` (the imaginary unit) is not recognized. In mathlib, the imaginary unit is `Complex.I`. Also, the set difference `-Set.range id` is likely just an attempt to negate all elements in a set, but `Set.range id` is the set of all complex numbers (since `id` is identity), so subtracting it from a finite set does not make sense and is not the intended operation.

The set given is `{-(1 : ℂ), -2 + I, -2 - I}` which is just `{ -1, -2 + i, -2 - i }`. Since the finite set is the answer, the best correct and minimal expression is:

```lean
{-(1 : ℂ), -2 + Complex.I, -2 - Complex.I}
```

This is a closed form finite set of three complex numbers. This aligns with the problem which states that the three expressions formed by pairwise products sums come out to these values.

Hence, the corrected final answer is:

<<<{-(1 : ℂ), -2 + Complex.I, -2 - Complex.I}>>>
