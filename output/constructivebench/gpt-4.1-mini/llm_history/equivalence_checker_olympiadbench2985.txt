Ground Truth Answer: 60
Proposed Answer: (19 + 20 + 21)
Let's analyze this step by step:

1. The problem gives specific values for a, b, c (19, 20, 21 respectively)
2. The expression to evaluate is (a² + b² + c² + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca)/(a + b + c)
3. The ground truth answer is 60
4. The proposed answer is (19 + 20 + 21) = 60

First, let's verify the ground truth:
The numerator can be rewritten as (a + b + c)² = (19 + 20 + 21)² = 60² = 3600
The denominator is (a + b + c) = 60
So the expression equals 3600/60 = 60, which matches the ground truth.

The proposed answer gives the denominator (a + b + c) which equals 60, the same as the ground truth answer. While the proposed answer doesn't show the full calculation, it arrives at the correct final answer.
