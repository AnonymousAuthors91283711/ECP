Ground Truth Answer: fun a x => a * x
Proposed Answer: fun a z => a * z
<<<True>>>

The proposed answer `fun a z => a * z` is equivalent to the ground truth answer `fun a x => a * x` because:
1. Both are linear functions multiplying their input by a constant `a`
2. The choice of variable name (`x` vs `z`) doesn't affect the mathematical meaning
3. Both satisfy the given functional equation in the problem statement
4. They represent the same family of solutions parameterized by `a`
