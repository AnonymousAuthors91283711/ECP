Ground Truth Answer: 81
Proposed Answer: (10 : ℝ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a value of x (other than 1) that satisfies the given logarithmic equation.

2. The equation simplifies to:
   |log₆x - log₆9| = 2|log₆10 - log₆6|

3. This can be rewritten using logarithm properties:
   |log₆(x/9)| = 2|log₆(10/6)|

4. The ground truth answer is 81, which comes from:
   - Solving x/9 = (5/3)² or x/9 = (3/5)²
   - The positive solution gives x = 9*(5/3)² = 9*(25/9) = 25 (but this doesn't match 81)
   - Alternatively, considering the other case gives x = 9*(9/25) = 81/25 (still not 81)
   - There seems to be some discrepancy here

5. The proposed answer is 10, which would not satisfy the equation when substituted.

Given that neither the ground truth nor the proposed answer seems to correctly solve the equation as stated, but the ground truth is claimed to be 81 (which might be correct for a different but similar problem), while the proposed answer 10 is clearly incorrect, I conclude:

<<<False>>>
