abbrev omnimath3638_answer : ℕ → ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3638 (n : ℕ) :
  ∑ k in Finset.range (n + 1), (10^k - 1)/9 = omnimath3638_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (10^(n+1) - 10 - 9 * n) / 81
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => ((10^(n + 1) - 1) / 81 : ℚ)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem: We need to find a closed-form expression for the sum ∑_{k=0}^n (10^k - 1)/9.

Ground Truth Answer: (10^(n+1) - 10 - 9n)/81
Proposed Answer: (10^(n+1) - 1)/81

Let's verify:
1. The sum can be rewritten as (1/9)(∑10^k - ∑1) = (1/9)((10^{n+1}-1)/9 - (n+1))
2. This simplifies to (10^{n+1}-1 - 9(n+1))/81 = (10^{n+1} - 10 - 9n)/81

The proposed answer is missing the "-10 -9n" terms from the numerator, only having "-1". This is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
