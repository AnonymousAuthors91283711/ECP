Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: 17
Let me analyze this problem carefully.

The problem defines a sequence where:
- For even n: next term is n/2 + 1
- For odd n: next term is (n+1)/2

Starting with 16, let's compute a few terms to see the pattern:
1. 16 (even) → 16/2 + 1 = 9
2. 9 (odd) → (9+1)/2 = 5
3. 5 (odd) → (5+1)/2 = 3
4. 3 (odd) → (3+1)/2 = 2
5. 2 (even) → 2/2 + 1 = 2
From term 4 onward, the sequence stays at 2 forever.

The ground truth says the 100th term is 2, which matches our computation.
The proposed answer is 17, which would only be correct for the first term (term 0), but the problem asks for term 100.
