theorem olympiadbench2257 (i j : ℕ) (hi : i ≥ 1) (hj : j ≥ 1) :
  olympiadbench2257_answer (i, j) = 4 + 3 * (i - 1) + (3 + 4 * (i - 1)) * (j - 1) := by sorry
example : olympiadbench2257_answer (50, 40) = 4090 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun (i, j) => 4 + 3 * (i - 1) + (3 + 4 * (i - 1)) * (j - 1)
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℕ × ℕ => 4 + 3 * (p.1 - 1) + (3 + 4 * (p.1 - 1)) * (p.2 - 1)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both expressions compute the same value using the same formula, just with different variable naming (using pair components p.1 and p.2 versus directly using i and j). The mathematical operations and structure are identical.
