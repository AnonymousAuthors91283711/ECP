The error is due to the fact that `z` is a variable within the theorem context and is not available at the top level where `omnimath523_answer` is defined. To fix this, you can express the answer solely in terms of the given constant `z = 1 - 2 * Complex.I`, or alternatively, you can define `omnimath523_answer` as a function that takes `z` as an argument.

Since the problem likely expects a closed form in terms of `z`, and `z` is fixed as `1 - 2 * Complex.I`, the neat way is to substitute `z`'s value directly in `omnimath523_answer`. The given series is:

S = ∑' n : ℕ, (n + 1) / z^(n + 1)

Recall that ∑_{n=0}^∞ (n+1) x^n = 1 / (1-x)^2 for |x|<1. Here, x = 1 / z, so

S = ∑_{n=0}^∞ (n+1) (1 / z)^{n+1} = (1 / z) ∑_{n=0}^∞ (n+1)(1 / z)^n = (1 / z) * (1 / (1 - (1 / z))^2 ) = 1 / (z - 1)^2.

So the final answer is 1 / (z - 1)^2 where z = 1 - 2 * Complex.I.

Therefore, define

noncomputable abbrev omnimath523_answer : ℂ := (1 : ℂ) / ((1 - 2 * Complex.I) - 1)^2

That is, use the explicit value of z, not the symbol `z`.
