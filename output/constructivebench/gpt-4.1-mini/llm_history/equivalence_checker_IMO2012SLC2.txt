Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2 * n - 1) / 5
Proposed Answer: fun n => Nat.div (n + 1) 2 * Nat.div (n + 2) 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of pairs (a,b) where:
   - All pairs have distinct elements (a≠b, etc.)
   - a + b ≤ n
   - All sums a+b are distinct

2. Ground truth answer: (2n-1)/5 (integer division)
   - This suggests a linear relationship with n, divided by 5

3. Proposed answer: (n+1)/2 * (n+2)/2 (both integer divisions)
   - This is a quadratic expression in n

The two answers are fundamentally different in nature:
- The ground truth is linear in n
- The proposed answer is quadratic in n

For example, let's test n=6:
- Ground truth: (12-1)/5 = 2 (integer division)
- Proposed: (7/2)*(8/2) = 3*4 = 12

These give completely different results, and the proposed answer grows much faster than the ground truth.
