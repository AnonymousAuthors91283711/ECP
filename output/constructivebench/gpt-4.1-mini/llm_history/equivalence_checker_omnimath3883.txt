theorem omnimath3883 (f : ℚ → ℚ) (hf : ∀ x, x > 0 → f x > 0) :
  (∀ x y, x > 0 → y > 0 → f (x^2 * (f y)^2) = (f x)^2 * f y) ↔ f = omnimath3883_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun _ => 1
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℚ => x
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is about finding all functions f: ℚ → ℚ that satisfy the given functional equation for positive rationals.

2. The ground truth answer is the constant function f(x) = 1 for all x ∈ ℚ.

3. The proposed answer is the identity function f(x) = x.

Let's test the proposed answer against the condition:
For f(x) = x, the left side becomes f(x² * (f y)²) = x² * y²
The right side becomes (f x)² * f y = x² * y
These are not equal (x²y² ≠ x²y in general), so f(x) = x doesn't satisfy the condition.

The ground truth answer f(x) = 1 works:
Left side: f(x² * (f y)²) = f(x² * 1²) = f(x²) = 1
Right side: (f x)² * f y = 1² * 1 = 1
These are equal.
