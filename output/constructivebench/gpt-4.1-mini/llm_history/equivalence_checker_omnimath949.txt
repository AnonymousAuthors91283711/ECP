Ground Truth Answer: 11/30
Proposed Answer: 1/6
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the probability that a random permutation of 6 elements has exactly one fixed point.

2. The ground truth answer is 11/30 ≈ 0.3667.

3. The proposed answer is 1/6 ≈ 0.1667.

4. The correct probability can be calculated using derangement theory. For exactly one fixed point in a permutation of n elements:
   - Choose 1 element to be fixed (6 choices)
   - The remaining 5 elements must form a derangement (no fixed points)
   - Number of derangements for 5 elements is !5 = 44
   - Total such permutations: 6 × 44 = 264
   - Total permutations: 6! = 720
   - Probability: 264/720 = 11/30

The proposed answer 1/6 is incorrect as it doesn't account for the derangement requirement of the remaining elements.

<<<False>>>
