Ground Truth Answer: fun ⟨x, y⟩ => 2 * x + (y - x^2)
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℝ × ℝ => 2 * p.1 + p.1^2 - p.2
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: fun ⟨x, y⟩ => 2 * x + (y - x^2)
   Simplified: 2x + y - x²

2. Proposed: fun p : ℝ × ℝ => 2 * p.1 + p.1^2 - p.2
   Simplified: 2x + x² - y (where p.1 = x, p.2 = y)

Comparing the two:
Ground Truth: 2x + y - x²
Proposed: 2x + x² - y

These are not equivalent expressions. The signs on y and x² terms are opposite. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
