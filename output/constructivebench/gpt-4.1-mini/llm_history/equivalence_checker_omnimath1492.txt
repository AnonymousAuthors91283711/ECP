Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0), (1, 1)}
Proposed Answer: {(0, 0), (1, -1), (-1, 1)}
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is to find all integer pairs (n, m) such that 2^(3^|n|) = 3^(2^|m|) - 1.

Ground truth gives {(0,0), (1,1)} while proposed answer gives {(0,0), (1,-1), (-1,1)}.

Let's test each case:

1. (0,0):
   2^(3^0) = 2^1 = 2
   3^(2^0) - 1 = 3^1 - 1 = 2
   This works.

2. (1,1):
   2^(3^1) = 2^3 = 8
   3^(2^1) - 1 = 3^2 - 1 = 8
   This works.

3. (1,-1):
   Absolute values make this equivalent to (1,1), so it should work.

4. (-1,1):
   Absolute values make this equivalent to (1,1), so it should work.

The proposed answer includes all valid solutions since absolute values make sign irrelevant. The ground truth missed the negative variants which are equally valid.
