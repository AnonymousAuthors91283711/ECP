The error arises because in Lean, `k!` is not recognized directly as notation for factorial. You should use the factorial function `fact k` from `Nat` (if imported) or define it yourself. Also, the summation `% 1000` is applied on the sum, and the summation syntax requires `.sum` or `Finset.sum`.

Since `padicValNat 5 factorial_product` calculates the power of 5 dividing the product ∏k=1^100 k!, and since the product is over factorials, the valuation is additive over multiplication:

padicValNat 5 (∏ k=1^100 k!) = ∑ k=1^100 padicValNat 5 (k!)

Therefore, the answer is ( ∑_{k=1}^{100} padicValNat 5 (k!) ) mod 1000.

We fix the code by using factorial from `Nat`, that is `fact k`, and use `Finset.sum`.

Final corrected Lean expression should be:

<<< (Finset.Icc 1 100).sum (fun k => padicValNat 5 (fact k)) % 1000 >>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Explanation:
The error "unknown identifier 'fact'" occurs because Lean's mathlib uses `Nat.factorial` rather than `fact` as the factorial function. We should replace `fact` by `Nat.factorial`.  
Also, the sum over `k` in `Finset.Icc 1 100` of `padicValNat 5 (Nat.factorial k)` gives the total number of factors of 5 in the product of the factorials 1!, 2!, ..., 100!.  
Since `(Finset.Icc 1 100).sum f` is deprecated notation, we use `(Finset.Icc 1 100).sum fun k => ...`.  
Finally, the whole expression modulo 1000 is desired.  

Thus the fixed and fully Lean-compilable answer is:  

<<<(Finset.Icc 1 100).sum (fun k => padicValNat 5 (Nat.factorial k)) % 1000>>>
