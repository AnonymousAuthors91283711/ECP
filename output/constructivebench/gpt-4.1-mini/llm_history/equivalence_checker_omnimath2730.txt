Ground Truth Answer: 23/96
Proposed Answer: (1/2) * (3/4)^2 * (1 - 3/4) + (1/2) * (3/4) * (1 - 3/4) * (1/3) * (1 - 1/3) + (1/2) * (1 - 1/2) * (1/3) * (3/4) * (1 - 3/4) + (1 - 1/2) * (1/3) * (3/4)^2 * (1 - 3/4)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

The problem is calculating the probability of getting exactly 3 wins in a sequence where:
- Initial win probability is 1/2
- After a win, next win probability is 3/4
- After a loss, next win probability is 1/3

The ground truth answer is 23/96 ≈ 0.239583.

The proposed answer is exactly the same as the p3Wins expression in the theorem statement, just with the numerical values substituted in. Let's evaluate each term:

1. First term: (1/2)*(3/4)^2*(1/4) = 9/128 ≈ 0.0703125
2. Second term: (1/2)*(3/4)*(1/4)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 6/288 ≈ 0.0208333
3. Third term: (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/3)*(3/4)*(1/4) = 3/192 ≈ 0.015625
4. Fourth term: (1/2)*(1/3)*(3/4)^2*(1/4) = 9/384 ≈ 0.0234375

Adding them up: 9/128 + 6/288 + 3/192 + 9/384 = 23/96

The proposed answer is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer when simplified.
