theorem omnimath1788
(a b c : ℝ)
(habc : a ^ 2 - b * c = 14 ∧ b ^ 2 - c * a = 14 ∧ c ^ 2 - a * b = -3)

Ground Truth Answer: 17 / 5
Proposed Answer: 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a system of equations:
   a² - bc = 14
   b² - ca = 14
   c² - ab = -3
   And asks for |a + b + c|

2. The ground truth answer is 17/5 (3.4)

3. The proposed answer is 7

Analysis:
- The proposed answer (7) is significantly different from the ground truth (3.4)
- The equations suggest a symmetric system where the variables are related in a particular way
- The ground truth answer comes from solving the system properly, while the proposed answer doesn't match this solution
- There's no obvious transformation that would make 7 equivalent to 17/5

Conclusion: The answers are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
