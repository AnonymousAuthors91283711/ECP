theorem omnimath3951 (n : ℕ) (hn : 1 < n) (P : ℝ[X]) (hP : 0 < degree P) :
  (∀ x : ℝ, eval x (∏ i ∈ Finset.range n, P.comp (X^(i+1))) = eval x (P.comp (X^(n*(n+1)/2)))) ↔ 
  ∃ k : ℕ, P = omnimath3951_answer n k := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n k => if Even n then X^k else -X^k
Proposed Answer: fun (n k : ℕ) => X ^ k
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem is about finding a polynomial P that satisfies a specific evaluation condition involving composition with powers of X.

2. The ground truth answer shows that the polynomial depends on whether n is even or odd - it's X^k when n is even and -X^k when n is odd.

3. The proposed answer always returns X^k regardless of n's parity.

4. The condition in the theorem shows that the sign matters because of the product evaluation condition. When n is odd, the product would introduce a sign change that needs to be accounted for in P.

The proposed answer is incorrect because it doesn't account for the parity of n, which is crucial for satisfying the given condition. The ground truth answer correctly handles both cases.
