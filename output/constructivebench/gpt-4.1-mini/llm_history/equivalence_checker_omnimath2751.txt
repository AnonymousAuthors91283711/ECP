Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the number of integer pairs (a, b) where:
   - 4 < a < b < 22
   - (4 + a + b + 22)/4 = 13

2. Simplifying the equation:
   (4 + a + b + 22)/4 = 13
   => a + b + 26 = 52
   => a + b = 26

3. So we need pairs (a, b) where:
   - 4 < a < b < 22
   - a + b = 26

4. Let's find all possible pairs:
   - a = 5, b = 21
   - a = 6, b = 20
   - a = 7, b = 19
   - a = 8, b = 18
   - a = 9, b = 17
   - a = 10, b = 16
   - a = 11, b = 15
   - a = 12, b = 14

5. That's exactly 8 valid pairs. The proposed answer of 9 is incorrect as it counts one extra pair that either doesn't satisfy the conditions or doesn't exist.
