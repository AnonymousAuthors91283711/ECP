Ground Truth Answer: fun N => ∃ a b : ℕ, N = 2^a * 3^b
Proposed Answer: fun N => Nat.Coprime N 6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for which natural numbers N, every residue class modulo N can be represented as a sum of squares (0² + 1² + 2² + ... + (n-1)² mod N for some n).

2. The ground truth answer states that N must be of the form 2^a * 3^b (a product of powers of 2 and 3).

3. The proposed answer states that N must be coprime with 6 (i.e., not divisible by 2 or 3).

These are not equivalent:
- The ground truth includes numbers like 6 (2^1 * 3^1) which are not coprime with 6.
- The proposed answer would include numbers like 5, 7, 11 etc. which are coprime with 6 but cannot be expressed as 2^a * 3^b.

The proposed answer is incorrect because it's too broad - it includes numbers that shouldn't be included (like primes >3) and excludes numbers that should be included (like 6, 12, etc.).
