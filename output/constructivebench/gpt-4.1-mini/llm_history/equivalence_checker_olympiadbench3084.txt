Ground Truth Answer: 4096
Proposed Answer: 524288
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive function f : ℤ → ℕ with:
   - f(n) = f(n-1) * f(n-2)
   - f(n) > 0 for n > 0
   - f(1) = f(2)/512
   - 1/f(1) = 2*f(2) (in ℚ)

2. From the conditions:
   - Let f(1) = a, f(2) = b
   - From f(1) = f(2)/512: a = b/512 ⇒ b = 512a
   - From 1/f(1) = 2*f(2): 1/a = 2b ⇒ b = 1/(2a)
   - Combining: 512a = 1/(2a) ⇒ 1024a² = 1 ⇒ a² = 1/1024 ⇒ a = 1/32
   - Then b = 512*(1/32) = 16

3. Now we can compute:
   - f(3) = f(2)*f(1) = 16*(1/32) = 1/2
   - f(4) = f(3)*f(2) = (1/2)*16 = 8
   - f(f(4)) = f(8)

4. Continuing the sequence:
   - f(5) = f(4)*f(3) = 8*(1/2) = 4
   - f(6) = f(5)*f(4) = 4*8 = 32
   - f(7) = f(6)*f(5) = 32*4 = 128
   - f(8) = f(7)*f(6) = 128*32 = 4096

The ground truth answer is 4096 (f(8)), while the proposed answer is 524288. The calculations show the correct answer should be 4096.
