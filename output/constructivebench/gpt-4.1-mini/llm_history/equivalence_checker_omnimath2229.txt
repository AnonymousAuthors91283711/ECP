Ground Truth Answer: 100
Proposed Answer: 17173
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us an integer polynomial P with:
   - All coefficients between 0 and 100 (exclusive)
   - P(10) = 331633
   - P(-10) = 273373
   And asks for P(1)

2. The ground truth answer is 100, which makes sense because:
   - The coefficients must be digits (0-9) since P(10) gives their concatenation
   - P(-10) gives the alternating sum which helps verify
   - 331633 in digits is [3,3,1,6,3,3]
   - Checking: 3-3+1-6+3-3 = -5 ≠ given P(-10), so this can't be right
   - Wait, this suggests the ground truth might be incorrect

3. The proposed answer is 17173, which would correspond to:
   - P(1) = sum of coefficients
   - But this seems too large given the constraints
   - For P(10)=331633, maximum possible sum would be 5*9=45 (since 99999>331633>9999)

4. The ground truth seems incorrect based on the P(-10) check, while the proposed answer seems too large.
