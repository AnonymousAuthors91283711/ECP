Ground Truth Answer: 78
Proposed Answer: 108
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have three real numbers a, b, c in geometric progression (since b = a*r and c = a*r²)
2. Given a + b + c = 114 and a*b*c = 46656
3. The ground truth answer claims a + c = 78
4. The proposed answer claims a + c = 108

Let's verify the ground truth:
- For a geometric progression, let's assume a = x/r, b = x, c = x*r
- Then sum: x/r + x + x*r = x(1/r + 1 + r) = 114
- Product: (x/r)*x*(x*r) = x³ = 46656 ⇒ x = 36
- So 36(1/r + 1 + r) = 114 ⇒ 1/r + r = 114/36 - 1 = 13/6
- Solving 6r² - 13r + 6 = 0 gives r = 2/3 or 3/2
- For r=2/3: a=54, b=36, c=24 ⇒ a+c=78
- For r=3/2: a=24, b=36, c=54 ⇒ a+c=78

The proposed answer 108 doesn't match either case. The ground truth is consistently 78 in both scenarios.
