Ground Truth Answer: 10
Proposed Answer: -4/3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the product of roots of the polynomial equation:
   (X-4)(X-2) + (X-2)(X-6) = 0

2. First, let's simplify the polynomial:
   (X-2)[(X-4) + (X-6)] = (X-2)(2X-10) = 2(X-2)(X-5)

3. The roots are clearly X=2 and X=5

4. The product of roots is 2 * 5 = 10

The ground truth answer correctly gives 10 as the product of roots. The proposed answer of -4/3 is incorrect as it doesn't match the actual product of roots.
