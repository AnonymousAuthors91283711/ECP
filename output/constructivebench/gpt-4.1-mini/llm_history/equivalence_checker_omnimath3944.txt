Ground Truth Answer: fun _ => 0
Proposed Answer: fun p => (p.1 + p.2) - (p.1 - p.2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a function f: ℝ² → ℝ that sums to zero on any unit square.

2. The ground truth answer is the zero function (fun _ => 0), which clearly satisfies the condition since 0+0+0+0=0.

3. The proposed answer simplifies to:
   fun p => (p.1 + p.2) - (p.1 - p.2) = p.1 + p.2 - p.1 + p.2 = 2*p.2

This is not the zero function (except when p.2=0), and it doesn't satisfy the condition for all unit squares. For example, take a unit square at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1):
f(0,0) + f(1,0) + f(1,1) + f(0,1) = 0 + 0 + 2*1 + 2*1 = 4 ≠ 0.
