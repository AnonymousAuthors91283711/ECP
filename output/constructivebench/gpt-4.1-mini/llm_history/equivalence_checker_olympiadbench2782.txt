Ground Truth Answer: 16
Proposed Answer: 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves complex numbers and exponents, specifically evaluating when (Complex.ofReal (-1) + i)^k equals Complex.ofReal (1/2^T) with T = -8.

2. The expression simplifies to (-1 + i)^k = 1/2^-8 = 256.

3. Calculating (-1 + i)^k:
   - The magnitude of (-1 + i) is √((-1)² + 1²) = √2
   - The angle is 3π/4 (135 degrees)
   - So in polar form: (√2)^k * e^(i * k * 3π/4) = 256

4. For the magnitudes to match: (√2)^k = 256 ⇒ (2^(1/2))^k = 2^8 ⇒ 2^(k/2) = 2^8 ⇒ k/2 = 8 ⇒ k = 16

5. The ground truth answer is 16, which matches our calculation.

6. The proposed answer is 3, which doesn't satisfy the equation:
   - (√2)^3 ≈ 2.828 ≠ 256
   - The angle part would be 9π/4 which is equivalent to π/4, but the magnitude is wrong.
