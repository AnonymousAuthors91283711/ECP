The error occurs because you wrote multiple let bindings on the same line without separating them. In Lean, `let` statements inside a `let` block should each be on their own line or separated by semicolons.

Also, the ratio you want is (independentConfigurations / totalConfigurations) which is (colorChoices * patternChoices * (colorChoices + patternChoices - 1))^n divided by (colorChoices * patternChoices)^n. Simplifying the ratio base:

Let c = colorChoices = 2, p = patternChoices = 2,

Then numerator base = c * p * (c + p - 1) = 2 * 2 * (2 + 2 - 1) = 4 * 3 = 12

Denominator base = c * p = 4

Ratio = (12^n) / (4^n) = (12/4)^n = 3^n = 3^6 = 729

So the reduced fraction is 729/1, which is coprime.

Hence the answer should be (3^6, 1) = (729, 1).

This matches the simplified calculation.

Therefore, the final answer is (729,1).

The error is due to missing line breaks or semicolons between the `let` bindings in Lean. In Lean, `let` bindings in a `let` block should be separated by line breaks or semicolons; putting them all on one line separated only by spaces is invalid syntax.

Additionally, based on the problem statement, the ratio `independentConfigurations / totalConfigurations` simplifies to a rational number which we want in lowest terms and coprime numerator and denominator.

Given the parameters:

- n = 6
- colorChoices = 2
- patternChoices = 2

Compute:

totalConfigurations = (colorChoices * patternChoices)^n = (2 * 2)^6 = 4^6 = 4096

independentConfigurations = (colorChoices * patternChoices * (colorChoices + patternChoices - 1))^n  
= (2 * 2 * (2 + 2 - 1))^6 = (2 * 2 * 3)^6 = (12)^6

Calculate 12^6 / 4^6 = (12/4)^6 = 3^6 = 729

So independentConfigurations / totalConfigurations = 729 / 1

This fraction is reduced already, with numerator 729 and denominator 1, which are coprime.

Hence, the answer is (729, 1), but the issue is in the syntax of 'let' bindings.

Reformatting the `let` bindings with line breaks fixes the error:
