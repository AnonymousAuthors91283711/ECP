theorem P2019AIMEII_2 :
  let (p, q) := P2019AIMEII_2_answer
  probVisits7 7 = p / q ∧ p.Coprime q := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: (99, 128)
Proposed Answer: (21, 32)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive probability function probVisits7 where:
   - Base cases: probVisits7 0 = 0, probVisits7 1 = 1, probVisits7 2 = 1
   - Recursive case: probVisits7 (n+3) = (probVisits7 (n+2) + probVisits7 (n+1)) / 2

2. We need to compute probVisits7 7 and express it as a reduced fraction p/q.

3. Let's compute the values step by step:
   probVisits7 3 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1
   probVisits7 4 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1
   probVisits7 5 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1
   probVisits7 6 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1
   probVisits7 7 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1

Wait, this seems incorrect as it would give 1/1, which contradicts both answers. Let me recompute more carefully:

probVisits7 0 = 0
probVisits7 1 = 1
probVisits7 2 = 1
probVisits7 3 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1
probVisits7 4 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1
probVisits7 5 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1
probVisits7 6 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1
probVisits7 7 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1

This still gives 1/1. There must be a misunderstanding of the problem. The ground truth answer is (99, 128), which suggests the recursion might be more complex than shown here.

Given that:
- The ground truth is (99, 128)
- The proposed answer is (21, 32)
- 99/128 ≈ 0.7734
- 21/32 ≈ 0.6562

These are clearly different values. The proposed answer is incorrect.
