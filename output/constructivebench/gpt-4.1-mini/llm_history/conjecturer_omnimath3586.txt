    x^2010 = fib 2009 * x + fib 2008 ↔ x ∈ omnimath3586_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
<<<{x : ℝ | x = (fib 2009 : ℝ) + (fib 2008 : ℝ) * x⁻¹ ∧ x ≠ 0}>>>

Explanation: The equation x^2010 = fib 2009 * x + fib 2008 suggests x satisfies a 2nd order linear recurrence relation characteristic polynomial. The solutions correspond to roots of x^2 - fib 2009 * x - fib 2008 = 0, i.e. x = (fib 2009 ± sqrt(...))/2. Expressing this as a set, the roots solve x = fib 2009 + fib 2008 / x with x ≠ 0, capturing both roots without existential quantifiers.
