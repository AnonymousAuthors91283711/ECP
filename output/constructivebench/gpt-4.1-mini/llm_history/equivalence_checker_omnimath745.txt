abbrev omnimath745_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath745 :
  (∑ a in range 81, ∑ b in range 81, if b ≤ a then (choose a b : ZMod 3).val else 0) / (81 * 81) = omnimath745_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1816 / 6561
Proposed Answer: (1/2 : ℚ)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves summing binomial coefficients modulo 3 over a specific range and then normalizing by 81×81.

2. The ground truth answer is 1816/6561 ≈ 0.2767

3. The proposed answer is 1/2 = 0.5

4. These values are significantly different (0.2767 vs 0.5), and there's no obvious simplification or transformation that would make them equivalent.

5. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth either numerically or in form.
