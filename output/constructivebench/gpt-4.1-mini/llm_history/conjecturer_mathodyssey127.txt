The issue is that the proposed answer uses the variable `p`, which is not in scope at the point where the abbreviation is defined. Lean abbreviations (or definitions) have to be fully self-contained or else they have to take parameters. 

Here `mathodyssey127_answer` depends on `p`, which is a variable only introduced in the theorem, and so should be a function that takes `p : ℝ` as input.

Furthermore, the problem states "P1 = P2 ∧ P1 ≠ 0 → P3 = mathodyssey127_answer". Given that P1 and P2 are equal probabilities of binomial distribution terms, we want to express P3 in terms of P1 (or P2), p, and so on.

Let's analyze the condition P1 = P2:

P1 = C(5,1) p (1-p)^4 = 5 p (1-p)^4

P2 = C(5,2) p^2 (1-p)^3 = 10 p^2 (1-p)^3

Set equal:

5 p (1-p)^4 = 10 p^2 (1-p)^3

Divide both sides by p (non zero) and (1-p)^3 (non zero since 0 < p < 1):

5 (1-p) = 10 p

5 - 5p = 10 p

5 = 15 p

p = 1/3

So, under the hypothesis, p = 1/3.

Now, P3 = C(5,3) p^3 (1-p)^2 = 10 p^3 (1-p)^2

Substitute p = 1/3:

p^3 = (1/3)^3 = 1/27

(1-p)^2 = (2/3)^2 = 4/9

P3 = 10 * (1/27) * (4/9) = 10 * 4 / (27*9) = 40 / 243

So, mathodyssey127_answer = 40 / 243.

Since 40/243 is the fixed value of P3 under the hypothesis.

Therefore, the answer is a real number independent of p (since p is fixed to 1/3 in the hypothesis).

Therefore, mathodyssey127_answer := 40 / 243.

Thus, the abbreviation is valid stand-alone, Lean will accept it.

This matches the enumerated result pattern.

<<<40 / 243>>>
