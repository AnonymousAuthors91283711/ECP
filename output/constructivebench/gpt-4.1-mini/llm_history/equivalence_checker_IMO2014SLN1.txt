theorem IMO2014SLN1 (n : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) :
  IsGreatest {m : ℕ | ¬ ∃ (s : Finset ℕ), (∀ k ∈ s, k < n) ∧ m = ∑ k in s, (2^n - 2^k)} (IMO2014SLN1_answer n) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n - 2) * 2^n + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n => 2^n - 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest natural number m such that m cannot be expressed as a sum of distinct terms of the form (2^n - 2^k) where k < n.

2. The ground truth answer is (n-2)*2^n + 1, which is a well-known solution to this IMO problem.

3. The proposed answer is 2^n - 2, which is significantly different from the ground truth.

Let's test with n=3:
- Ground truth: (3-2)*2^3 + 1 = 9
- Proposed: 2^3 - 2 = 6

We can verify that for n=3, the numbers that can be expressed as such sums are:
0, 4 (2^3-2^2), 6 (2^3-2^1), 8 (2^3-2^0), 10 (4+6), 12 (4+8), 14 (6+8), 18 (4+6+8)
The largest missing number is indeed 9 (ground truth), not 6 (proposed).
