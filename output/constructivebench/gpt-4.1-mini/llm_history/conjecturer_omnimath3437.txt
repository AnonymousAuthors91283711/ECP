Explanation: The set S consists of positive integers p such that p = 2(a + b) with a,b > 0 and ab=24. The positive factor pairs of 24 are (1,24), (2,12), (3,8), (4,6) giving sums 25,14,11,10 and thus p in {50,28,22,20}. The smallest natural not in S but uniquely determined by these constraints is 6.
