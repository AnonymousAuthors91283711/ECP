Ground Truth Answer: 2 * Real.sqrt 2 - 2
Proposed Answer: 2 / Real.sqrt 3
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

The problem asks to find the greatest value of the function f(x) = (x² + 2 - √(x⁴ + 4))/x for x > 0.

Let's analyze the proposed answer (2/√3) vs the ground truth (2√2 - 2):

1. The ground truth answer (2√2 - 2) ≈ 0.8284
2. The proposed answer (2/√3) ≈ 1.1547

These are clearly different numerical values. To verify which is correct, let's find the maximum of f(x):

- Find f'(x) and set it to 0 to find critical points
- After solving, we find the maximum occurs at x = √2
- Substituting x = √2 into f(x) gives f(√2) = 2√2 - 2

The proposed answer doesn't match this calculation. The ground truth is correct while the proposed answer is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
