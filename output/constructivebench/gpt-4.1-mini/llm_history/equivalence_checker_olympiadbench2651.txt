Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have a system of equations:
   - x + 9y = 17
   - 40x + 41y = 42 (since T = 40)

2. Solving the system:
   From first equation: x = 17 - 9y
   Substitute into second equation: 40(17 - 9y) + 41y = 42
   Simplify: 680 - 360y + 41y = 42 → -319y = -638 → y = 2
   Then x = 17 - 9*2 = -1

3. Calculate 20x + 14y:
   20*(-1) + 14*2 = -20 + 28 = 8

The ground truth answer is 8, while the proposed answer is 4. These are clearly different numerical values.
