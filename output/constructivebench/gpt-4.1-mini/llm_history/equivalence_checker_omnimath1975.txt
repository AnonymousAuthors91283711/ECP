Ground Truth Answer: 9
Proposed Answer: 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence xₖ with initial conditions x₀ = x₁ = x₂ = 1 and a recurrence relation for k > 2.

2. The recurrence relation is: xₖ = (xₖ₋₁ + xₖ₋₂ + 1)/xₖ₋₃

3. Let's compute the first few terms to see the pattern:
   x₀ = 1
   x₁ = 1
   x₂ = 1
   x₃ = (1 + 1 + 1)/1 = 3
   x₄ = (3 + 1 + 1)/1 = 5
   x₅ = (5 + 3 + 1)/1 = 9
   x₆ = (9 + 5 + 1)/3 = 5
   x₇ = (5 + 9 + 1)/5 = 3
   x₈ = (3 + 5 + 1)/9 = 1
   x₉ = (1 + 3 + 1)/5 = 1
   x₁₀ = (1 + 1 + 1)/3 = 1
   x₁₁ = (1 + 1 + 1)/1 = 3
   ... and the cycle repeats every 8 steps.

4. The sequence is periodic with period 8. Since 2013 mod 8 = 5 (because 2013 = 8*251 + 5), x₂₀₁₃ = x₅ = 9.

5. The ground truth answer is 9, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 3, which is actually x₃.
