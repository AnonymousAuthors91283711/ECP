Ground Truth Answer: 222
Proposed Answer: (9^4 - 8^4)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem asks for the count of numbers from 1 to 2017 (inclusive) that don't contain any 0 digits when written in base 3.

2. The ground truth answer is 222.

3. The proposed answer is (9^4 - 8^4), which equals 6561 - 4096 = 2465.

Analysis:
- The proposed answer calculates the count of 4-digit base-3 numbers without any 0 digits (9^4) minus those that are greater than 2017 (8^4). However:
  - 2017 in base 3 is 2202201 (7 digits), not 4 digits
  - The calculation doesn't properly account for numbers with fewer than 4 digits
  - The result (2465) is much larger than the correct answer (222)

The proposed answer is completely incorrect in both approach and result.

<<<False>>>
