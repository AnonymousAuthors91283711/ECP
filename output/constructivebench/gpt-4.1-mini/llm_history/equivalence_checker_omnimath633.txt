Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n where (X+1)^n - 1 can be expressed as (X^2+1)*P + 3*Q for some polynomials P,Q ∈ ℤ[X].

2. Ground truth answer is 8, which means n=8 is the smallest number satisfying this condition.

3. Proposed answer is 2, suggesting n=2 is the smallest solution.

Let's test n=2:
(X+1)^2 - 1 = X^2 + 2X
Can this be expressed as (X^2+1)*P + 3*Q?
We'd need to find P,Q ∈ ℤ[X] such that X^2 + 2X = (X^2+1)*P + 3*Q
This seems impossible since the constant term on the left is 0, while on the right it would be P(0) + 3Q(0), which can't be made to equal 0 with integer coefficients.

Therefore, n=2 doesn't satisfy the condition, while n=8 does (as given by the ground truth). The proposed answer is incorrect.
