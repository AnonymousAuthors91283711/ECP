Ground Truth Answer: 20 / 3
Proposed Answer: -12 / 25
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two equations:
   - 4a² + 9b² = 20
   - (2a + 3b)² = 20 + 12ab

2. Let's expand the second equation:
   (2a + 3b)² = 4a² + 12ab + 9b² = 20 + 12ab (from the first equation)

3. This simplifies to:
   4a² + 9b² + 12ab = 20 + 12ab
   => 4a² + 9b² = 20 (which matches the first given equation)

4. This means the second equation doesn't give us new information - it's just a restatement of the first equation.

5. The ground truth answer is 20/3, but the proposed answer is -12/25. These are clearly different values.

6. To verify, let's test if a*b = -12/25 satisfies the original equation:
   If we take a = 3/√5 and b = 4/√5 (which satisfies 4a² + 9b² = 20), then a*b = 12/5 ≠ -12/25.

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect.
