Ground Truth Answer: 1999008 / 1999012
Proposed Answer: 166 / 183
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating a probability ratio where:
   - sameColorPairs = sum of n*(n-1) for each color pair
   - redGreenPairs = 2*2 (special case)
   - The ratio is sameColorPairs/(sameColorPairs + redGreenPairs)

2. Calculating sameColorPairs:
   - For all colors except "copper": 8 colors × (2×1) = 16
   - For "copper": 2000×1999 = 3,998,000
   - Total sameColorPairs = 16 + 3,998,000 = 3,998,016

3. redGreenPairs = 4 (as given)

4. Total denominator = 3,998,016 + 4 = 3,998,020

5. The ground truth gives 1,999,008/1,999,012 which simplifies to 3,998,016/3,998,020 (both numerator and denominator ×2)

6. The proposed answer 166/183 is approximately 0.907, while the correct ratio is approximately 0.999999 - completely different.
