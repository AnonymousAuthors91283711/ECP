theorem P2015AMCB_8 : 
  (625 ^ (logb 5 2015)) ^ (1/4) = P2015AMCB_8_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2015
Proposed Answer: 25 * 2015 ^ (1/4)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer step by step.

1. The problem involves simplifying (625^(log₅ 2015))^(1/4)
2. First, recognize that 625 = 5⁴
3. So we can rewrite the expression as: (5⁴)^(log₅ 2015))^(1/4) = 5^(4 * log₅ 2015)^(1/4)
4. Using logarithm power rule: 5^(log₅ 2015⁴)^(1/4) = (2015⁴)^(1/4) = 2015
5. The ground truth answer is indeed 2015
6. The proposed answer is 25 * 2015^(1/4), which is not equal to 2015 (for example, when 2015=1, 25*1^(1/4)=25 ≠ 1)

The proposed answer is incorrect. The correct simplification leads directly to 2015, not the proposed expression.
