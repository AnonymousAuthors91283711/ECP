theorem omnimath1561 : Nat.gcd (a_sequence 5000) (b_sequence 501) = omnimath1561_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sequences follow linear recurrences. The gcd stabilizes at gcd(a_sequence 1, b_sequence 1) = 1 since the recurrences involve coprime coefficients without common factors emerging for these indices.
