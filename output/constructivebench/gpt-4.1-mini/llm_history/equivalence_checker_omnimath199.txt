Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℤ | n ≥ 0}
Proposed Answer: {n : ℤ | n ≥ 1}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer {n : ℤ | n ≥ 1} is mostly correct but misses the case when n=0. For n=0, a⁰ + b⁰ + c⁰ = 3 = x⁰ + y⁰ + z⁰, which satisfies the inequality (as equality). Therefore, n=0 should be included in the solution set, making the ground truth {n : ℤ | n ≥ 0} correct. The proposed answer is correct for all n≥1 but incorrect for n=0.
