Ground Truth Answer: {√2 / 2, -√2 / 2}
Proposed Answer: {w | w = (√2/2) ∨ w = -(√2/2)}
<<<True>>>

The proposed answer and ground truth answer are equivalent. Both represent the set containing exactly two elements: √2/2 and -√2/2. The proposed answer uses set builder notation with a disjunction (∨), while the ground truth answer uses explicit enumeration of elements. Both forms correctly describe the same set.
