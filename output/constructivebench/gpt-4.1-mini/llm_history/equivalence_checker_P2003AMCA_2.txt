Ground Truth Answer: 91
Proposed Answer: 29
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find the smallest positive integer n that satisfies the equation:
   2 * n * 4 + 2 * n * (4 + 5) = 2366

2. Let's simplify the equation:
   - First term: 2 * n * 4 = 8n
   - Second term: 2 * n * (4 + 5) = 2 * n * 9 = 18n
   - Combined: 8n + 18n = 26n = 2366

3. Solving for n:
   n = 2366 / 26 = 91

4. The ground truth answer is 91, which matches our calculation.

5. The proposed answer is 29, which does not satisfy the equation:
   26 * 29 = 754 ≠ 2366

The proposed answer is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
