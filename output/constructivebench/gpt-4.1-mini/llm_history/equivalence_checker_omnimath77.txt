theorem omnimath77 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ (m n : ℕ), 0 < m → 0 < n → m ≥ n → f (m * φ (n^3)) = f m * φ (n^3)) ↔ f ∈ omnimath77_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ (k : ℕ), ∀ (m : ℕ), 0 < m → f m = k * m}
Proposed Answer: { f | ∃ c : ℕ, ∀ n : ℕ, f n = c * n ∨ n = 0 ∧ f n = 0 }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but differs slightly from the ground truth. The ground truth specifies the condition ∀ (m : ℕ), 0 < m → f m = k * m, while the proposed answer includes an additional case for n = 0 (f n = 0). The ground truth doesn't explicitly specify the behavior at n=0, but the proposed answer's inclusion of this case makes it slightly more restrictive. The core multiplicative form (f n = c * n) is correct, but the handling of n=0 makes them not fully equivalent.
