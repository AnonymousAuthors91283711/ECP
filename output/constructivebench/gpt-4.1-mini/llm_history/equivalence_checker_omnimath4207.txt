Ground Truth Answer: fun n => {s | ∃ k : ℕ, k < n ∧ s = 2^k}
Proposed Answer: fun n => (Finset.range n).image (fun k => 2 * k + 1)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a set of natural numbers with:
   - Exactly n elements (n=100)
   - All elements between 1 and 25000
   - All pairwise sums are unique (no two different pairs sum to the same value)

2. Ground Truth Answer:
   - Uses powers of 2: {1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^99}
   - This satisfies all conditions because:
     * Binary representations ensure unique sums
     * 2^99 < 25000 (since 2^15=32768 > 25000, but n=100 would exceed)
     * Wait, actually 2^99 is way larger than 25000, so this can't be correct for n=100

3. Proposed Answer:
   - Creates odd numbers: {1, 3, 5, ..., 199}
   - Satisfies:
     * n=100 elements (from 1 to 199 in steps of 2)
     * All ≤ 25000
     * Sums are unique because (a+b)/2 gives the midpoint which uniquely determines the pair

The ground truth answer actually fails because 2^100 is way larger than 25000, while the proposed answer works perfectly. However, the ground truth would work if we adjusted the exponent range to stay under 25000 (which would require n ≤ 14 since 2^15=32768).
