abbrev P2007AMCA_5_answer : ‚Ñù := sorry
theorem P2007AMCA_5 : 
  0.2 * P2007AMCA_5_answer + 0.1 * (1 - 0.2) * P2007AMCA_5_answer = 10500 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 37500
Proposed Answer: 17500
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation given is: 0.2x + 0.1*(1-0.2)x = 10500
2. Simplifying:
   0.2x + 0.08x = 10500
   0.28x = 10500
3. Solving for x:
   x = 10500 / 0.28 = 37500

The ground truth answer (37500) is correct based on this calculation. The proposed answer (17500) is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the equation.

<<<False>>>
