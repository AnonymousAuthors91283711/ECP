theorem P2023AMCA_20 :

Ground Truth Answer: 5
Proposed Answer: (fun n => (3 * 2^n - 1) % 10) 2023
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem involves a recursively defined sequence (build_row) and asks for the last digit of the sum of the 2023rd row.

2. The ground truth answer is simply 5.

3. The proposed answer is a function (3 * 2^n - 1) mod 10 evaluated at n=2023.

Calculating the proposed answer:
- 2^2023 mod 10 cycles every 4: 2,4,8,6
- 2023 mod 4 = 3, so 2^2023 ends with 8
- 3*8 = 24 → ends with 4
- 4-1 = 3 → ends with 3

But the ground truth is 5, while the proposed answer evaluates to 3. They are different.
