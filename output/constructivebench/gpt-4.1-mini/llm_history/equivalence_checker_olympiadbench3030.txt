Ground Truth Answer: 20
Proposed Answer: -2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. Given:
   - T = 1/40
   - x + y = 5
   - x² - y² = 1/T = 40
   - x - z = -7

2. From x² - y² = (x+y)(x-y) = 40, and x+y = 5, we get:
   5(x-y) = 40 ⇒ x-y = 8

3. Now we have:
   x + y = 5
   x - y = 8
   Adding these: 2x = 13 ⇒ x = 6.5
   Then y = 5 - 6.5 = -1.5

4. From x - z = -7 ⇒ 6.5 - z = -7 ⇒ z = 13.5

5. Therefore x + z = 6.5 + 13.5 = 20

The ground truth answer is 20, while the proposed answer is -2. These are clearly different.
