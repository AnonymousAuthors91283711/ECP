Ground Truth Answer: -50
Proposed Answer: -74
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for an integer k and real numbers a, d (with d ≠ 0) such that the polynomial X⁴ + answer*X² + k*X + 225 can be factored into four distinct linear terms in arithmetic progression (a-3d, a-d, a+d, a+3d).

2. When we expand (X-(a-3d))(X-(a-d))(X-(a+d))(X-(a+3d)), we get:
   X⁴ - 4aX³ + (6a²-10d²)X² + (-4a³+20ad²)X + (a⁴-10a²d²+9d⁴)

3. Comparing coefficients with X⁴ + answer*X² + k*X + 225:
   - Coefficient of X³ must be 0 ⇒ a = 0
   - Then the equation simplifies to X⁴ + (-10d²)X² + 225
   - Comparing constant term: 9d⁴ = 225 ⇒ d² = 5 ⇒ d = ±√5
   - Then the X² coefficient is -10d² = -50
   - The X term must be 0 (since a=0)

The ground truth answer (-50) correctly matches the coefficient calculation, while the proposed answer (-74) does not match any step in this derivation.
