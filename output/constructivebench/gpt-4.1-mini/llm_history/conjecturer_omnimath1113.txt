  (success : ℚ) / (total : ℚ) = omnimath1113_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: (1/20)^5 / (∑ k in finset.Icc 3 5, (Nat.choose 5 k : ℚ) * (1/20)^k * (19/20)^(5 - k)). Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 53, which is at "finset.Icc 3 5, (Nat" in "abbrev omnimath1113_answer : ℚ := (1/20)^5 / (∑ k in finset.Icc 3 5, (Nat.choose 5 k : ℚ) * (1/20)^k * (19/20)^(5 - k))", there is an error: unknown identifier 'finset.Icc'.
. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Explanation: The error arises because `finset.Icc` is not fully qualified or imported properly. Since you have `open Finset`, you only need to use `Icc` instead of `finset.Icc`. Also, to make the summation expression compile, convert `Nat.choose` to `ℚ` properly with `↑(Nat.choose 5 k)`. Because the input is `5` and `k` is `ℕ`, Lean will coerce them correctly inside the sum.

The final expression, for the probability of 5 sixes (dice showing 20s since `d i = 19` uses zero-based indexing), divided by the total probability of at least 3 such "20"s, matches the enumerated pattern and reasoning about binomial probabilities.

Corrected Lean expression:

<<<(1/20)^5 / (∑ k in Icc 3 5, (↑(Nat.choose 5 k) : ℚ) * (1/20)^k * (19/20)^(5 - k))>>>
