Ground Truth Answer: 32
Proposed Answer: 52
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n > 20 that satisfies:
   - 13 + (n - 20)/4 = n/2
   - (n - 20) is divisible by 4

2. Let's test the ground truth answer (32):
   - (32 - 20)/4 = 12/4 = 3
   - 13 + 3 = 16
   - 32/2 = 16
   - 12 is divisible by 4
   - This satisfies all conditions

3. Now test the proposed answer (52):
   - (52 - 20)/4 = 32/4 = 8
   - 13 + 8 = 21
   - 52/2 = 26
   - 21 ≠ 26, so it doesn't satisfy the equation
   - While 32 is divisible by 4, the main equation fails

The proposed answer (52) doesn't satisfy the given conditions, while the ground truth (32) does. They are not equivalent.
