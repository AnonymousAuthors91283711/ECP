theorem omnimath3198 :
  ∃! x : ℕ, x ≤ 10 ∧ 3 * x + 2 * (10 - x) = 26 ∧ x = omnimath3198_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a unique natural number x ≤ 10 that satisfies the equation: 3x + 2(10 - x) = 26

2. Let's solve the equation:
   3x + 20 - 2x = 26
   (3x - 2x) + 20 = 26
   x + 20 = 26
   x = 6

3. The ground truth answer is 6, which correctly solves the equation.

4. The proposed answer is 8, which does not satisfy the equation:
   3*8 + 2*(10-8) = 24 + 4 = 28 ≠ 26

<<<False>>>
