Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 2^(n-1)
Proposed Answer: fun n => (2 : ℝ)^(1 - 2^n)
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is asking for the least value 'a' such that the inequality (x^(2*2^n) + 1)/2 ≤ (a*(x-1)^2 + x)^(2^n) holds for all real x.

The ground truth answer suggests that this least value is 2^(n-1).

The proposed answer suggests it's 2^(1 - 2^n).

Let's test with n=1:
- Ground truth: 2^(1-1) = 1
- Proposed: 2^(1-2) = 0.5

For n=1, the inequality becomes (x^4 + 1)/2 ≤ (a*(x-1)^2 + x)^2. The minimal 'a' that satisfies this for all x is indeed 1 (not 0.5), as can be verified by checking at x=0.

This shows the proposed answer is incorrect even for the simplest case. The exponents in the proposed answer are completely different from the ground truth.
