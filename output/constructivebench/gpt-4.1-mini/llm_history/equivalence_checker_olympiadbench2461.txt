Ground Truth Answer: (log 2) / (log 2 - log 3)
Proposed Answer: (log (3) / log 2) / (2 - (log (3) / log 2))
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground truth: (log 2) / (log 2 - log 3)
Proposed: (log 3 / log 2) / (2 - (log 3 / log 2))

Let's simplify both expressions:

1. Ground truth can be rewritten as:
   1 / (1 - (log 3 / log 2)) by dividing numerator and denominator by log 2

2. Proposed answer can be rewritten as:
   (log 3 / log 2) / (2 - log 3 / log 2)

These are clearly different expressions. The ground truth has 1 in the numerator and (1 - log3/log2) in denominator, while the proposed answer has (log3/log2) in numerator and (2 - log3/log2) in denominator.

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
