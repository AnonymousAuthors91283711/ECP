theorem omnimath52 (a n : ℕ) (ha : a > 0) (hn : n > 0) :
  n ∣ ((a + 1)^n - a^n) ↔ (a, n) ∈ omnimath52_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: { (a, n) | n = 1 ∧ a > 0 }
Proposed Answer: { (a, n) | n = 1 ∨ a % n = 0 }
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
We need to find all pairs (a,n) where n divides (a+1)^n - a^n, with a,n > 0.

Ground Truth Answer:
This claims the only solutions are when n=1 (for any a>0). Indeed, when n=1:
(a+1)^1 - a^1 = 1, and 1 divides 1 for any a.

Proposed Answer:
This claims solutions are either when n=1 OR when a is divisible by n (a%n=0).

Evaluation:
1. The proposed answer includes all cases where n=1, which matches the ground truth.
2. However, it also adds cases where a is divisible by n. Let's test this:
   Take a=2, n=2 (a%n=0):
   (2+1)^2 - 2^2 = 9-4=5, but 2 does not divide 5. So this is a counterexample.

Conclusion:
The proposed answer incorrectly includes cases where a%n=0 but n≠1. The ground truth is more precise.
