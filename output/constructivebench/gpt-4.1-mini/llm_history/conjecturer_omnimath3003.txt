The issue is that defining `omnimath3003_answer` using a noncomputable division in ℝ requires marking the definition as `noncomputable`. Alternatively, we can express the value numerically or simplify the expression. Since from the hypothesis `2 * x - 3 = 10`, solving for x gives `x = 13/2`. Then `4 * x = 4 * (13/2) = 26`.

To avoid issues with noncomputability, let's write `omnimath3003_answer` simply as 26 (a rational casted to ℝ).

Hence, final answer in Lean should be:

<<<26>>>
