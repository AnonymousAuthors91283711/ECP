noncomputable abbrev omnimath1809_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1809
(a b c : ℝ)
(habc : a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ c > 0)
(hgeos : a * c = b ^ 2)
(hright : a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = c ^ 2)
: (c / a = omnimath1809_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<(2 : ℝ)>>>

Explanation: From the conditions a*c = b² and a² + b² = c² with positive real a,b,c, it follows c/a = 2.
