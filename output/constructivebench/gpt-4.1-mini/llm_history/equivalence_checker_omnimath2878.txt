Ground Truth Answer: 5 / 2
Proposed Answer: (4 / 8) + (8 / 4)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer (4/8) + (8/4) simplifies to 0.5 + 2 = 2.5, which is exactly equal to the ground truth answer 5/2 (also 2.5). The function otimes is defined as λ a b : ℝ => a / b + b / a, so the proposed answer correctly applies this function to the inputs 4 and 8. Therefore, the answers are equivalent.
