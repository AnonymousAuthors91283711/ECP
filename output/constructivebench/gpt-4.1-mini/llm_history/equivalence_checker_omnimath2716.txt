theorem omnimath2716 (c : ℤ) (h : (X ^ 2 + 12 * X + C c).IsRoot 18) :
    (X ^ 2 + 12 * X + C c).IsRoot (omnimath2716_answer c) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun c => -12 - 18  -- For x² + 12x + c, sum of roots is -12, so other root is -12 - 18
Proposed Answer: fun c : ℤ => (c - 36)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
- We have a quadratic polynomial X² + 12X + C c
- We know 18 is a root (given by the hypothesis h)
- We need to find the other root

Ground Truth Answer:
- Uses the fact that sum of roots of x² + 12x + c is -12 (from Vieta's formula)
- If one root is 18, the other must be -12 - 18 = -30
- This is correct by Vieta's formulas

Proposed Answer:
- Suggests the other root is (c - 36)
- This doesn't match Vieta's formula result
- Let's test with an example: if c=0, ground truth gives -30, proposed gives -36
- These don't match, so the answers are not equivalent

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't properly apply Vieta's formulas to find the second root.

<<<False>>>
