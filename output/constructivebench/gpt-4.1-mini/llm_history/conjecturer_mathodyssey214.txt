The error message indicates that the definition relies on a noncomputable real number operation (division and logarithm over reals), which requires marking the definition as noncomputable in Lean to bypass the computability restrictions. You can fix this by declaring the abbreviation as `noncomputable abbrev` instead of just `abbrev`.

Hence, the fixed Lean expression is:

The error message here indicates that Lean cannot compute the value because it depends on noncomputable real number operations such as real division and the logarithm. To fix this, mark the abbreviation as `noncomputable` so Lean knows it may not have an executable implementation and will allow these operations.

Hence, the corrected answer should be:

The main issue is the misuse of `noncomputable def` inside an abbreviation or as an expression. In Lean, `abbrev` expects a term, not a definition starting keyword like `noncomputable def`. To fix the error, we need to define `mathodyssey214_answer` as an expression that Lean accepts and which is noncomputable because of `Real.log`.

Also, since the problem data is fixed numerically, and there's no parameterization by variables here, we can just write the answer as an expression of type `ℝ`. To avoid issues with floating constants like `0.07` and `21337.85` Lean expects them as reals, so we usually write literals as `0.07` of type `ℝ`, which is okay as Lean will coerce from `ℚ` or `ℝ` literals.

Hence, the correct fix is to write:

```lean
noncomputable abbrev mathodyssey214_answer : ℝ := (1 / 0.07) * Real.log (21337.85 / 8589)
```

This defines it as a noncomputable abbreviation (expression) rather than a definition.

Below is the final fixed answer enclosed in the required delimiters.
