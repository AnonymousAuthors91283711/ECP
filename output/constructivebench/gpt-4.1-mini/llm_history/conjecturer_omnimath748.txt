The error message indicates that the definition of `omnimath748_answer` depends on noncomputable real number division, so it should be marked as `noncomputable` in Lean. Also, the fraction `-8048/2012` should be written in a way that Lean accepts as a real number literal or expression; for example, using `(-8048 : ℝ) / 2012` or a decimal.

From the problem conditions, the final answer is \(a + c = -\frac{8048}{2012}\), which simplifies to approximately -4.

To fix the Lean error, declare the abbreviation as noncomputable and write it in a fully explicit real division form:

The error arises because "noncomputable abbrev" is not valid syntax in Lean. You can simply declare the answer as an abbreviation without "noncomputable", since this is a closed-form real number expression. Also, the value -8048/2012 simplifies to -4, which matches the likely value for \( a + c \) given the symmetry and conditions involving the quadratics and points.

Hence, the corrected and simplified final answer is:

<<<(-4 : ℝ)>>>
