Explanation:
The sum of cubes from 1 to n is known to be equal to the square of the sum of the first n natural numbers:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^n k^3 = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2.
\]
In Lean, `div` is not an operator but a function `Nat.div`. Also, to correctly parse the expression, we need to use parentheses carefully. We should write the sum and division explicitly.

The error message suggests a parsing or syntax problem. Writing `(2001 * 2002 div 2)^2` is ambiguous: Lean interprets `2002` as a function application. We must clarify by writing `(2001 * 2002) div 2` to show division applies to the product, then square the whole result.

Final answer expression in Lean for `omnimath398_answer` is thus:
```lean
((2001 * 2002) div 2)^2
```

This matches the known formula and resolves the parsing issues.

The well-known formula for the sum of cubes is that the sum of n^3 from 1 to N equals (N(N+1)/2)^2. For n=2001, the sum is ((2001*2002)/2)^2.

The error in Lean is due to operator precedence and the use of div; div is function application and needs to be explicitly applied or expressed properly. Also, parentheses might be needed to disambiguate parsing.

In Lean, to write integer division you can write (2001 * 2002) / 2 or use div explicitly as Nat.div.

Also, Lean may confuse the ^2 with function application; best to add parentheses.

Correct syntax would be:

((2001 * 2002) / 2) ^ 2

or better:

((2001 * 2002) / 2)^2

Complete expression:

((2001 * 2002) / 2)^2

This should compile fine.

So final corrected Lean expression is:

((2001 * 2002) / 2)^2

The problem is to find the sum of cubes from 1 to 2001. The well-known formula for the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers is:

∑_{k=1}^n k^3 = (n(n+1)/2)^2.

So for n = 2001, the sum is (2001 * 2002 / 2)^2.

Let's represent this in Lean properly:

- Use ∑ n ∈ Finset.Icc 1 2001, n^3 for the sum notation.
- The answer should be (2001 * 2002 / 2)^2.
- We must replace the sorry with this closed-form expression.
- The Lean expression should be fully numeral arithmetic (using Nat.mul, Nat.div, Nat.pow etc.) but can also use the infix notation.

Putting it all together:

<<<
(2001 * 2002 / 2) ^ 2
