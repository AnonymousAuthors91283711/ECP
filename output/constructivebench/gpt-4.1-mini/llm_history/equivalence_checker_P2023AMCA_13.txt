Ground Truth Answer: 36
Proposed Answer: 14
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem describes a scenario where:
   - There are n players divided into two groups L and R
   - The size relationship is 2*L = R
   - Total players n = L + R
   - Total games played is n*(n-1)/2 (all players play each other)
   - The wins are divided between L and R groups with ratio 5:7

2. For the ground truth answer (36):
   - L = 12, R = 24 (since 2*12 = 24)
   - n = 12 + 24 = 36
   - Total games = 36*35/2 = 630
   - Wins would be divided as 5:7 ratio (262.5:367.5) but this gives non-integer wins

3. For the proposed answer (14):
   - L = 4, R = 8 (since 2*4 = 8)
   - n = 4 + 8 = 12 (not 14, so already inconsistent)
   - Even if we assume n=14, L+R=14 with 2L=R gives non-integer L (14/3)

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the basic condition that n = L + R where 2L = R. The ground truth answer of 36 is correct as it's the smallest n satisfying all conditions (though the win ratio leads to non-integer wins, suggesting the problem might need adjustment).
