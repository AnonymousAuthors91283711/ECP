Ground Truth Answer: 21
Proposed Answer: 23
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest odd integer x (since x = 2k+1) such that the sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers starting from x equals 125.

2. The sum can be simplified:
   x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) = 5x + 20 = 125
   => 5x = 105
   => x = 21

3. The ground truth answer correctly solves this as 21.

4. The proposed answer is 23, which is incorrect because:
   - It's larger than 21
   - If we check: 23 + 25 + 27 + 29 + 31 = 135 ≠ 125

The proposed answer is simply wrong, not equivalent to the correct answer.
