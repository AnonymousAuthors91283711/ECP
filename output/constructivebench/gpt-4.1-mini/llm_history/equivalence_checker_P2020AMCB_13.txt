Ground Truth Answer: sqrt (log 6 / log 2 + log 6 / log 3)
Proposed Answer: sqrt (log 3 / log 2) + sqrt (log 2 / log 3)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer is: √(log6/log2 + log6/log3)
The proposed answer is: √(log3/log2) + √(log2/log3)

Let's simplify the ground truth answer:
√(log6/log2 + log6/log3) = √(log6(1/log2 + 1/log3)) = √(log6(log3 + log2)/(log2 log3))

Now, let's square the proposed answer:
(√(log3/log2) + √(log2/log3))² = log3/log2 + 2 + log2/log3

These are clearly different expressions. The ground truth involves log6 while the proposed answer doesn't, and their simplified forms don't match.

<<<False>>>
