Ground Truth Answer: {(5, 3)}
Proposed Answer: {(m, n) | m = n}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for which pairs (m,n) with m,n ≥ 3 there are infinitely many positive integers a satisfying the given equation.

2. The ground truth answer claims this only happens for (5,3).

3. The proposed answer claims this happens when m = n.

Let's test the proposed answer:
- For m = n, the equation becomes a^m + a - 1 = k*(a^m + a² - 1)
- For a = 1: 1 + 1 - 1 = k*(1 + 1 - 1) ⇒ 1 = k*1 ⇒ k=1 works for any m=n
- But this only gives one solution (a=1), not infinitely many
- The case (5,3) actually works because the equation has infinitely many solutions when (m,n)=(5,3)

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It includes all m=n cases which don't satisfy the "infinite solutions" condition
2. It misses the actual solution (5,3)

<<<False>>>
