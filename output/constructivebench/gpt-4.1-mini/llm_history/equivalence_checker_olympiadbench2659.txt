theorem olympiadbench2659 : 
  (10^(9^2 - 9))^(1/9)^(1/2)^(1/2) = olympiadbench2659_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 100
Proposed Answer: 10^(36)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The expression is: (10^(9^2 - 9))^(1/9)^(1/2)^(1/2)
2. First, calculate the exponent: 9^2 - 9 = 81 - 9 = 72
3. Now we have: (10^72)^(1/9)^(1/2)^(1/2)
4. The exponents are applied from right to left (top to bottom):
   - First (1/2) exponent: (10^72)^(1/9)^(1/2) = (10^72)^(1/9)^(1/2)
   - Next (1/2) exponent: (10^72)^(1/9) = 10^(72/9) = 10^8
   - Now apply the remaining exponents: (10^8)^(1/2)^(1/2) = 10^(8*(1/2)*(1/2)) = 10^(8*(1/4)) = 10^2 = 100

The ground truth answer is 100, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 10^36, which is incorrect.
