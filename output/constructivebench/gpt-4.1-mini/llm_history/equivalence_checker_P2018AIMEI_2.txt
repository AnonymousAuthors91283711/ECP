Ground Truth Answer: 925
Proposed Answer: 260
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find a 3-digit number (represented as a*14² + b*14 + c) that satisfies certain conditions when interpreted in different bases (base 14, 15, and 6).

2. The ground truth answer is 925, which is indeed the correct solution to this problem. This can be verified by:
   - Checking that 925 in base 14 equals 925 in base 15 when digits are swapped (b and c)
   - Checking that 925 in base 14 equals its representation in base 6
   - All constraints on a, b, c are satisfied

3. The proposed answer is 260, which:
   - Doesn't satisfy the base conversion conditions
   - Doesn't match the known correct answer
   - The digits don't satisfy the given constraints when converted between bases

Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
