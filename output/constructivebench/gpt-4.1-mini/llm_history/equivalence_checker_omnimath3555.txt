Ground Truth Answer: True
Proposed Answer: ∃ n : ℕ, n > 0 ∧
  (Finset.filter (fun d : ℕ =>
    d ∣ n ∧ Real.sqrt (n : ℝ) < (d : ℝ) ∧ (d : ℝ) < 2 * Real.sqrt (n : ℝ))
    (Finset.Icc 1 n)).card = 2020
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but differs in some technical details from the ground truth. The main differences are:
1. The proposed answer uses `Finset.filter` and `Finset.Icc` while the ground truth uses set notation `{d : ℕ | ...}` and `encard`
2. The proposed answer uses `Real.sqrt` with explicit type casting, while the ground truth uses `sqrt` (which might be `Nat.sqrt`)

The mathematical meaning is essentially the same, but the implementations differ in their technical details. The proposed answer would work for the same problem but isn't exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer.
