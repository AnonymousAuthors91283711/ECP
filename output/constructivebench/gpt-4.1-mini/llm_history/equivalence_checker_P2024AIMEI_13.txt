Ground Truth Answer: 110
Proposed Answer: 289
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for two things:
   - The smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n > 0 (which is given as 17)
   - The smallest m > 0 where 17² divides m⁴ + 1

2. The ground truth answer is 110, meaning 17² divides 110⁴ + 1.

3. The proposed answer is 289, which is 17².

Let's check:
- 110⁴ + 1 = 146410000 + 1 = 146410001
- 289² = 83521
- 146410001 ÷ 83521 ≈ 1753.0 (exact division)
So 110 is indeed correct.

For the proposed answer 289:
- 289⁴ + 1 = (17²)⁴ + 1 = 17⁸ + 1
- While 17² does divide 17⁸ + 1 (since 17⁸ ≡ (-1)⁴ ≡ 1 mod 17²), 289 is not the smallest such number (110 is smaller).
