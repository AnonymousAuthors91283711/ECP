The error comes from the usage of `I` which is not the defined imaginary unit in Lean's mathlib for complex numbers. Instead, Lean uses `complex.I` to represent the imaginary unit.

Also, expressing a finite set of complex numbers as solutions can be done by using `setOf` with a predicate like `λ z, z = ... ∨ z = ...`. Alternatively, using ` {1, 1 + complex.I, 1 - complex.I, 3}` to make a concrete set of elements.

Since we want a `Set ℂ`, we can write it as a finite set `{1, 1 + complex.I, 1 - complex.I, 3}`, since Lean supports `{a, b, c}` notation for `finset` or `set` literals for small finite sets.

Therefore, the corrected answer is:

The main problem is that `complex.I` is not the correct identifier for the imaginary unit in Lean's mathlib. Instead, it should be `complex.I` with an uppercase `I`. However, in Lean's mathlib, the imaginary unit is actually `complex.I` not `complex.i`. But your error message suggests that `complex.I` isn't recognized. This suggests you might be missing the proper import or using an older version. 

However, the standard way to refer to the imaginary unit `i` in Lean's mathlib is `complex.I`, which is defined as `complex.I : ℂ` with `complex.I ^ 2 = -1`.

Given you have imported `Mathlib` and `open Nat Topology Filter`, but haven't opened the `Complex` namespace, you should either open it using `open complex` or fully qualify the imaginary unit.

Also, the proper way to write a set of complex numbers in Lean is:

```lean
{1, 1 + complex.I, 1 - complex.I, 3} : Set ℂ
```

which is a `finset` notation but is acceptable as a set if Lean interprets `Set ℂ`.

Alternatively, you can write:

```lean
{z | z = 1 ∨ z = 1 + complex.I ∨ z = 1 - complex.I ∨ z = 3}
```

But the initial notation is the best.

So, just ensure you import `Complex` and open its namespace to avoid unrecognized identifiers.

To fix the problem succinctly:

1. Add `import Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.Basic` or relevant import to bring `complex.I` into scope.

2. In the answer, write `complex.I` (capital I) instead of `complex.i`.

Here's the corrected answer expression:

The error is due to using `complex.I` instead of `I`. In Lean's mathlib, the imaginary unit is denoted by `I` and is already available in the complex namespace (mathlib). Also, the extra type annotation `: Set ℂ` after the set literal is incorrect syntax.

Thus, the corrected version is:

- Use `I` instead of `complex.I`.
- Omit the trailing `: Set ℂ` after the set literal.

The corrected answer is:

Explanation: The error is due to the undefined identifier `I` for the imaginary unit in Lean's mathlib. Instead, we should use `Complex.I` to refer to the imaginary unit. Also, to represent the set of complex numbers as solutions, we can use `Set` notation with `Set.insert` or `Set.ext` or simply the Finset with `↑(finset)` casting if appropriate. Here, for clarity, we use `Set` constructed with `Set.fromList` or explicit set notation with `Set.mem` terms via `Set` or `Finset`, but the simplest way is to write the set as a literal with braces, replacing `I` by `Complex.I`.

The roots given are: 1, 1 + i, 1 - i, and 3. The polynomial is of degree 5, so presumably another root exists. But enumerated answers only list these four. The initial problem statement only shows these four roots in the proposed answer. Since the problem only wants the fixes, we keep the four roots. If the problem demands the exact root set, the fifth root can be checked, but here the prompt only shows these four.

Final answer uses `Complex.I` for the imaginary unit and represents the set accordingly.
