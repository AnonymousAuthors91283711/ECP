Ground Truth Answer: 7 * 2023
Proposed Answer: 43^2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest positive natural number n that is:
   - A perfect square (n = k² for some k)
   - Divisible by 2023

2. The ground truth answer is 7 × 2023 = 14161
3. The proposed answer is 43² = 1849

Now let's verify:
- 1849 is indeed 43² (perfect square)
- But 2023 = 7 × 17 × 17, and 1849 = 43 × 43
- 1849 ÷ 2023 ≈ 0.914 (not divisible by 2023)
- The correct smallest number should be 7 × 2023 = 14161, which is 119² (119 = 7 × 17)

The proposed answer fails the divisibility condition.

<<<False>>>
