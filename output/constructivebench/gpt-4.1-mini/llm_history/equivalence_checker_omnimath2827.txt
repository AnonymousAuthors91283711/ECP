abbrev omnimath2827_answer : â„š := sorry
theorem omnimath2827 : 
  1/9 + 1/18 = 1/omnimath2827_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 9/2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find a rational number `omnimath2827_answer` such that 1/9 + 1/18 = 1/`omnimath2827_answer`.

2. Calculating the left side:
   1/9 + 1/18 = 2/18 + 1/18 = 3/18 = 1/6

3. Therefore, we have:
   1/6 = 1/`omnimath2827_answer`
   which implies `omnimath2827_answer` = 6

4. The ground truth answer is indeed 6.

5. The proposed answer is 9/2, which is 4.5, not equal to 6.

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the equation.
