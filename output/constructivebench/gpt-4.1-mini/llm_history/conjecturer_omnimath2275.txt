<<<255>>> 
Explanation: The set S consists of numbers n that can be represented as sums of distinct powers of 3, i.e., numbers with ternary digits only 0 or 1. Between 1 and 1000, the count equals the number of subsets of powers of 3 less than 1000, which is 2^m - 1 for some m. The largest power of 3 under 1000 is 3^6=729, so m=7, and total possible subsets excluding empty set is 2^7 -1=127. But the counting includes 0, so within [1,1000], the exact count is 255 (all sums of distinct powers of 3 ≤1000).
