Ground Truth Answer: {2^(-2/3 : ℝ), 8}
Proposed Answer: {x | x = 4 ∨ x = 8}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is a logarithmic equation that needs to be solved for x > 0, x ≠ 1.

2. The ground truth answer gives two solutions: 2^(-2/3) and 8.

3. The proposed answer suggests x = 4 or x = 8.

Let's verify:
- For x = 8: Both answers agree this is a solution.
- For x = 4: Plugging into the equation gives log4/log4 - log16/log4 = 1 - 2 = -1 ≠ 7/6 - log8/log4 (≈ 7/6 - 1.5 ≈ -0.666...), so 4 is not a solution.
- The ground truth solution 2^(-2/3) is missing from the proposed answer.

The proposed answer includes an incorrect solution (4) and misses a correct solution (2^(-2/3)).
