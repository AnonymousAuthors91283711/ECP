Ground Truth Answer: fun T => 1/9
Proposed Answer: fun T => ((6 : ℚ) / (2 * T))
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem is asking for the ratio of prime-producing numbers to total numbers in the range [1, 2T] where T=9.

2. Ground truth answer is 1/9, which means for T=9 (range 1-18), there should be 2 numbers that produce primes (since 18 × 1/9 = 2).

3. Proposed answer is 6/(2T) = 3/T, which for T=9 gives 3/9 = 1/3.

4. Testing the actual function:
   - The polynomial n³-7n²+13n-6 factors as (n-1)(n-2)(n-3)
   - The absolute value will be prime only when two factors are ±1 and the third is prime
   - Checking n from 1 to 18, only n=4 (|4-1||4-2||4-3|=6 not prime) and n=6 (|6-1||6-2||6-3|=60 not prime) might work, but neither produces a prime
   - Actually, only n=0 would give |(-6)|=6 (not prime), but 0 is outside our range
   - Wait, the ground truth seems incorrect as there appear to be no primes in this range for this polynomial

However, the proposed answer (3/T) is definitely wrong as it gives 1/3 for T=9, while the ground truth claims 1/9. Both seem incorrect based on the polynomial analysis, but the question is about their equivalence.
