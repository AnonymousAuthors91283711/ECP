Ground Truth Answer: 4018021
Proposed Answer: (fun m => 2 * m + 1) 2004
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem gives a functional equation that must hold for all natural numbers m ≥ n, with a(1) = 3.

2. The ground truth answer is a specific value for a(2004): 4018021.

3. The proposed answer suggests a general solution a(m) = 2m + 1, and evaluates it at m=2004.

Let's verify:
- For a(m) = 2m + 1:
  - a(1) = 2*1 + 1 = 3 ✔ matches ha1
  - Plugging into the functional equation:
    LHS = (2(m+n)+1) + (2(m-n)+1) - m + n - 1 = 4m + 1 - m + n - 1 = 3m + n
    RHS = (1/2)(2(2m)+1 + 2(2n)+1) = (1/2)(4m + 4n + 2) = 2m + 2n + 1
    LHS ≠ RHS (3m + n ≠ 2m + 2n + 1)

The proposed solution doesn't satisfy the given functional equation, even though it matches the initial condition. Therefore, it's incorrect.
