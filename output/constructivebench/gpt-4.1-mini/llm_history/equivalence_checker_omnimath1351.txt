Ground Truth Answer: 2 + 2 * Real.sqrt 2 + 2 * Real.sqrt 3
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the sum of absolute values of all distinct real roots of the polynomial P(X) = X^4 - 4X^3 - 4X^2 + 16X - 8.

2. The ground truth answer is 2 + 2√2 + 2√3 ≈ 2 + 2.828 + 3.464 ≈ 8.292

3. The proposed answer is simply 4.

To verify:
- We can factor the polynomial as (X^2 - 2)(X^2 - 4X + 4) = (X^2 - 2)(X - 2)^2
- This gives roots at X = ±√2 and X = 2 (double root)
- The sum of absolute values of distinct roots is |√2| + |-√2| + |2| = √2 + √2 + 2 = 2 + 2√2 ≈ 4.828
- Even this simplified calculation shows the proposed answer of 4 is incorrect
- The ground truth answer includes √3 terms which suggests a different factorization

The proposed answer is clearly different from and incorrect compared to the ground truth answer.
