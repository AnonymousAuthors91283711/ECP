The error occurs because `-251 / 48` involves division on ℝ and Lean requires the definition to be marked `noncomputable` when it involves real division from the classical `Real` field, which is not computable by default.

To fix this error, mark the abbreviation as `noncomputable` and add parentheses to ensure division is treated correctly in Lean syntax.

Since your enumerated answer is `-251 / 48`, the corrected Lean expression is:

The error arises because you are using division on reals in a noncomputable context without marking the definition as `noncomputable`. Lean's mathlib treats real division as noncomputable (due to the construction of reals), and so any definition using division on `ℝ` that you want to compile must be marked `noncomputable`.

You can fix the error by adding `noncomputable` before your abbreviation. This tells Lean you acknowledge the definition is noncomputable, and then it will allow it.

Therefore, the correct final answer should be
