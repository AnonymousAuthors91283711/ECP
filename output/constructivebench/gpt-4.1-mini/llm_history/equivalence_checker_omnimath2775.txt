Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => 2 * x + y + 2015
Proposed Answer: fun x y => 2018 * (x + y) - 2017 * 2018
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence a(n) with:
   - a(1) = x
   - a(3) = y
   - For n > 1: a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n+1) - 1

2. We need to find the sum of the first 2018 terms.

3. The ground truth answer simplifies to 2x + y + 2015.

4. The proposed answer is 2018*(x+y) - 2017*2018.

Let's check if they're equivalent:
- Expand proposed answer: 2018x + 2018y - 2017*2018
- Ground truth: 2x + y + 2015

These are clearly not equivalent (different coefficients for x and y, and different constant terms). The proposed answer is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
