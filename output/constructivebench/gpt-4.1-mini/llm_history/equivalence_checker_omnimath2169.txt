Ground Truth Answer: 79
Proposed Answer: 77 + 91 + 143
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal sum a+b+c where a,b,c are positive integers satisfying a/77 + b/91 + c/143 = 1.

2. The ground truth answer is 79, which comes from the minimal solution where:
   - a = 33 (33/77 = 3/7)
   - b = 13 (13/91 = 1/7)
   - c = 33 (33/143 = 3/13)
   - Sum: 33 + 13 + 33 = 79
   - Check: 3/7 + 1/7 + 3/13 = 4/7 + 3/13 = 52/91 + 21/91 = 73/91 ≈ 0.802 (This doesn't equal 1, so there seems to be an error in the ground truth)

3. The proposed answer is 77+91+143=311, which would satisfy the equation (1+1+1=3 ≠ 1), so it's clearly incorrect.

However, the ground truth answer also appears incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the equation. There might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement or solutions.

Given that the proposed answer is clearly wrong and the ground truth appears incorrect as well, but is closer to what a minimal solution might look like:

<<<False>>>
