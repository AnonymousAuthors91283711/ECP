Ground Truth Answer: {70, 110}
Proposed Answer: {60}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find all real numbers x between 0 and 360 degrees that satisfy the trigonometric equation:
   √3 * cos(10°) = cos(40°) + sin(x°)

2. The ground truth answer is {70, 110}, meaning both 70° and 110° satisfy the equation.

3. The proposed answer is {60}, meaning only 60° satisfies the equation.

To verify, let's test the proposed answer:
For x = 60°:
√3 * cos(10°) ≈ 1.732 * 0.9848 ≈ 1.705
cos(40°) + sin(60°) ≈ 0.7660 + 0.8660 ≈ 1.632
These are not equal, so 60° is not a solution.

Testing the ground truth answers:
For x = 70°:
cos(40°) + sin(70°) ≈ 0.7660 + 0.9397 ≈ 1.7057 (matches √3*cos(10°))
For x = 110°:
cos(40°) + sin(110°) ≈ 0.7660 + 0.9397 ≈ 1.7057 (same as above)

The proposed answer is incorrect while the ground truth is correct.
