Ground Truth Answer: 834
Proposed Answer: (6090307 + 11201821 + 20603361 - 1) % 1000
Let me analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem defines a sequence a(n) with initial conditions a(1)=a(2)=a(3)=1 and a recurrence relation a(n+3) = a(n+2) + a(n+1) + a(n). It gives specific values for a(28), a(29), and a(30), and asks for the sum of the first 28 terms modulo 1000.

The proposed answer suggests calculating (a(28) + a(29) + a(30) - 1) mod 1000. Let's see why this might be equivalent to the sum:

1. From the recurrence relation, we can derive that the sum of the first n terms relates to later terms:
   sum_{k=1}^n a(k) = (a(n+2) + a(n) - 1)/2

2. For n=28, this would be:
   sum = (a(30) + a(28) - 1)/2

3. However, the proposed answer uses a(28) + a(29) + a(30) - 1, which doesn't match this formula.

Calculating the proposed expression:
(6090307 + 11201821 + 20603361 - 1) mod 1000
= (37895488) mod 1000
= 488

This doesn't match the ground truth answer of 834. The proposed answer is incorrect.
