abbrev omnimath1594_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1594 :
  {n : ℕ | n < 100 ∧ (n ∣ 2 ^ n + 2)} = omnimath1594_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {6, 66, 946}
Proposed Answer: {n | n < 100 ∧ n ∣ 2 ^ n + 2}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is a set comprehension that correctly describes the condition from the problem statement, but it doesn't explicitly list the elements like the ground truth answer does. The ground truth answer provides the concrete solution set {6, 66, 946}, while the proposed answer only gives the defining property. They are equivalent in meaning but not in form.
