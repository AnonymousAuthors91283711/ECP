Ground Truth Answer: 499500
Proposed Answer: 250000
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting numbers from 1 to 1,000,000 where n mod 1000 > n mod 1001.

2. Key observations:
   - For numbers ≤ 1000*1001=1,001,000 (which includes our range), n mod 1000 and n mod 1001 are independent random variables
   - The probability that n mod 1000 > n mod 1001 is exactly 1/2 minus the probability they're equal
   - They're equal only when n ≡ 0 mod 1001 (since 1000 ≡ -1 mod 1001)
   - There are floor(1,000,000/1001) = 999 such numbers

3. Exact calculation:
   - Total numbers: 1,000,000
   - Numbers where mods are equal: 999
   - Remaining numbers: 1,000,000 - 999 = 999,001
   - Half of these will have n mod 1000 > n mod 1001: 999,001/2 = 499,500.5
   - Since we can't have half a number, it's 499,500

The ground truth answer (499,500) is correct, while the proposed answer (250,000) is incorrect.
