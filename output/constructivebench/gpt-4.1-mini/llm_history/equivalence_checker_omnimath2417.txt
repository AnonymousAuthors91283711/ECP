Ground Truth Answer: 25502400
Proposed Answer: (99 * 100^3)
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is summing (n³ + 3n² + 3n) from n=1 to 99
2. Notice that n³ + 3n² + 3n = (n+1)³ - 1
3. Therefore, the sum becomes ∑[(n+1)³ - 1] = ∑(n+1)³ - ∑1
4. This equals (sum of cubes from 2 to 100) - 99
5. The sum of cubes formula is (n(n+1)/2)²
6. So we get [(100*101/2)² - 1] - 99 = 25502500 - 100 = 25502400

The proposed answer is (99 * 100^3) = 99,000,000, which is much larger than the correct answer. The proposed answer incorrectly assumes a linear relationship with the cube term, ignoring the proper summation of cubes.
