Explanation: The error arises because the Lean mathlib's real division involves noncomputable axioms, so pure definitional assignments like (2, 2/3) cause issues unless marked `noncomputable`. To fix this, we mark the abbreviation as `noncomputable` so Lean can accept it. Alternatively, we can write the second component as (2 / 3 : ℝ) to be explicit, but marking noncomputable is standard for real numbers involving division.

The pair (2, 2/3) satisfies the equation: a*(x + b*(x+3)) = 2*(x+6).

Expanding:

Left side: a*(x + b*x + 3b) = a * (x(1+b) + 3b)

Right side: 2x + 12

Equate coefficients:

a*(1+b) = 2

a*(3b) = 12

From a*(3b)=12 => 3ab=12 => ab=4

From a*(1+b)=2 => a + ab=2; but ab=4, so a+4=2 => a=-2??? Contradiction.

Try candidate a=2:

From 3ab=12 => 3*2*b=12 => 6b=12 => b=2

Then a*(1+b) = 2*(1+2) = 2*3=6 ≠ 2, no.

Try a=2:

From first: a*(1+b)=2 => 2*(1+b)=2 => 1+b=1 => b=0

From second: a*(3b)=12 => 2*3*0=0 ≠12 no

Try a=1:

a*(1+b) =2 => 1+b=2 => b=1

a*(3b) = 12 => 3*1=3 ≠ 12 no

Try a=3:

3*(1+b)=2 => 1+b=2/3 => b= -1/3

3*(3b)=12 => 9b=12 => b=4/3 ≠ -1/3 no

Try a=6:

6*(1+b)=2 => 1+b=1/3 => b=-2/3

6*(3b)=12 => 18b=12 => b=2/3 no

Try a=4:

4*(1+b)=2 => 1+b=1/2 => b=-1/2

4*(3b)=12 => 12b=12 => b=1 no

Since (2, 2/3) given by user guess does not satisfy, check again.

Left= a*(x + b(x+3))=a*(x + b x + 3b )= a*(x(1+b) + 3b)

We want = 2x +12

Equate:

a*(1+b) = 2   --- (1)

a*(3b) = 12   --- (2)

From (2): a*3b =12 => 3ab=12 => ab=4 => a=4/b

Plug into (1):

(4/b)*(1+b)=2

Multiply both sides by b:

4*(1 + b)=2b

4 + 4b = 2b

4b - 2b = -4

2b = -4

b = -2

Then a = 4/b = 4/(-2) = -2

Check:

a*(1+b) = -2 * (1 - 2) = -2 * (-1) = 2 correct

a*(3b) = -2 * (3 * -2) = -2 * -6 = 12 correct

So correct answer is (-2, -2)

Therefore, answer is (-2, -2).

The equation given is: for all x ∈ ℝ,

a * (x + b * (x + 3)) = 2 * (x + 6).

Expanding the left side:

a * (x + b * x + 3b) = a * ((1 + b) x + 3b) = a(1 + b) x + 3a b.

The right side is 2x + 12.

Equate coefficients:

a(1 + b) = 2  
3 a b = 12

From the second: 3 a b = 12 => a b = 4 => b = 4 / a.

Plug into the first: a (1 + b) = 2 => a + a b = 2. Since a b = 4, this is a + 4 = 2 => a = -2.

Then b = 4/a = 4/(-2) = -2.

So the unique solution is (a, b) = (-2, -2).

In Lean, just define:

(abbrev olympiadbench2532_answer : ℝ × ℝ := (-2, -2))

without any 'noncomputable' keyword (which is not expected here), and that fixes the error.
