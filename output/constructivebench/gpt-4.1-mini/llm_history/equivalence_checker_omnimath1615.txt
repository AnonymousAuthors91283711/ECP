Ground Truth Answer: fun z => if z^23 = 1 ∧ z.im ≠ 0 then 46 / 3 else 0
Proposed Answer: fun z : ℂ => (23 * (1 - z)) / (3 * (1 - z^3))
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. The ground truth answer is a piecewise function that returns 46/3 when z is a non-real 23rd root of unity, and 0 otherwise.

2. The proposed answer is a rational expression (23*(1-z))/(3*(1-z^3)).

For z being a non-real 23rd root of unity:
- z^23 = 1 and z ≠ 1 (since z.im ≠ 0)
- The denominator 1 - z^3 ≠ 0 because 3 is not a multiple of 23 (as 23 is prime)
- We can verify that for such z, the expression simplifies to 46/3:
  - The numerator becomes 23*(1-z)
  - The denominator becomes 3*(1-z^3) = 3*(1-z)(1+z+z^2)
  - The (1-z) terms cancel out
  - The remaining sum over all roots (1/(1+z+z^2)) sums to 46/3

For other values of z:
- The ground truth returns 0
- The proposed answer returns some complex number, not necessarily 0

The answers are equivalent ONLY when z is a non-real 23rd root of unity, but differ elsewhere. Since the problem specifies the condition z^23 = 1 ∧ z.im ≠ 0, but the proposed answer doesn't enforce this condition, they are not fully equivalent.
