theorem P2000AIMEI_3 :
  ∃! (ab : ℕ × ℕ), 0 < ab.1 ∧ 0 < ab.2 ∧ ab.1.Coprime ab.2 ∧
  (choose 2000 2) * ab.1^1998 * ab.2^2 = (choose 2000 3) * ab.1^1997 * ab.2^3 ∧
  ab.1 + ab.2 = P2000AIMEI_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Explanation: From the equation, the relation reduces to (2000*1999/2)*a^{1998}*b^2 = (2000*1999*1998/6)*a^{1997}*b^3, simplifying to 3a = b, with gcd(a,b)=1, thus a=1,b=3; sum is 4.
