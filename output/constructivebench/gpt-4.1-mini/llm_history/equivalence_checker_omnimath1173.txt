Ground Truth Answer: (8, 8)
Proposed Answer: (2, 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for positive integers x and y where:
   - x + y is a perfect square
   - x² + y² is a perfect square
   - x³ + y³ is a perfect square

2. Ground Truth (8,8):
   - 8 + 8 = 16 (4²)
   - 8² + 8² = 128 (not a perfect square)
   - 8³ + 8³ = 1024 (32²)
   Wait, this seems incorrect since 128 isn't a perfect square.

3. Proposed Answer (2,2):
   - 2 + 2 = 4 (2²)
   - 2² + 2² = 8 (not a perfect square)
   - 2³ + 2³ = 16 (4²)
   Also fails the second condition.

However, the ground truth answer itself doesn't satisfy all conditions (128 isn't a perfect square), while the proposed answer fails similarly. Both answers fail the second condition, but in different ways.

<<<False>>>
