abbrev omnimath2942_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2942 : 
  ∃ (k : ℕ), 3 + 11 * k = omnimath2942_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 113
Proposed Answer: 41
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find a natural number k such that 3 + 11*k equals some answer (omnimath2942_answer).

2. The ground truth answer is 113, which means:
   113 = 3 + 11*k → 110 = 11*k → k = 10 (which is a natural number)

3. The proposed answer is 41, which would mean:
   41 = 3 + 11*k → 38 = 11*k → k ≈ 3.4545 (not a natural number)

The proposed answer 41 doesn't satisfy the equation with a natural number k, while the ground truth answer 113 does. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
