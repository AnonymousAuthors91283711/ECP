Ground Truth Answer: 420
Proposed Answer: 216
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the largest natural number n where every positive integer m less than the cube root of n divides n.

2. The ground truth answer is 420. Let's verify this:
   - Cube root of 420 ≈ 7.49
   - Numbers to check: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
   - All these numbers divide 420 (420 is divisible by each)
   - 420 is indeed the largest such number (next candidate would be 840, but its cube root is ~9.44 and 8 doesn't divide 840)

3. The proposed answer is 216:
   - Cube root of 216 is exactly 6
   - Numbers to check: 1,2,3,4,5
   - While these all divide 216, 216 is not the largest such number (420 is larger and satisfies the condition)

The proposed answer is incorrect because while 216 satisfies the condition, it's not the largest number that does so.
