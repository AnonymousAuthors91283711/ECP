Ground Truth Answer: {[1/8, 1/12, 1/24]}
Proposed Answer: {l : List ℚ | l.sum = 1/4 ∧ ∀ x ∈ l, ∃ n : ℕ, 1 ≤ n ∧ x = 1 / n}

The proposed answer is mostly correct in terms of the logical structure and constraints, but it's not equivalent to the ground truth answer. The ground truth answer provides a specific solution (a concrete list), while the proposed answer gives a general description of all possible solutions (a set description). The constraints in both answers are essentially the same, but one is concrete while the other is abstract. Therefore, they are not strictly equivalent, but the proposed answer is correct in terms of describing the solution space.
