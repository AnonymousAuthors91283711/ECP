Ground Truth Answer: {(1, [1]), (3, [2, 3, 6]), (4, [4, 4, 4, 4])}
Proposed Answer: { (n, List.replicate (n - 1) 1 ++ [5 * n - 4 - (n - 1)]) | n ≥ 1 }
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
We need to find all pairs (n, ks) where:
1. n > 0
2. ks is a list of length n
3. Sum of ks is 5n - 4
4. Sum of reciprocals of ks is 1

Ground Truth Answer:
- (1, [1]): Valid (sum=1, reciprocal sum=1)
- (3, [2,3,6]): Valid (sum=11=5*3-4, reciprocal sum=1/2+1/3+1/6=1)
- (4, [4,4,4,4]): Valid (sum=16=5*4-4, reciprocal sum=4*(1/4)=1)

Proposed Answer:
This generates lists like:
- For n=1: [4] (but should be [1])
- For n=2: [1,5] (sum=6=5*2-4, but 1/1+1/5=1.2≠1)
- For n=3: [1,1,9] (sum=11=5*3-4, but 1+1+1/9≈1.11≠1)

The proposed answer only matches the ground truth for n=1 (but gives [4] instead of [1]), and fails for other cases. It doesn't capture the correct solutions for n=3 and n=4.
