Ground Truth Answer: fun n => choose n 2
Proposed Answer: fun n => n * (n - 1) / 2
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The ground truth answer uses the combination function "choose n 2" which calculates the number of ways to choose 2 elements from n elements, which is exactly n*(n-1)/2. These are two equivalent ways to express the same mathematical concept (the number of pairs in a set of size n). The proposed answer is just the expanded form of the combination formula.
