abbrev omnimath2817_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2817 (x : ℝ) : (10 : ℝ)^x * (10 : ℝ)^5 = (100 : ℝ)^4 ↔ x = omnimath2817_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

The equation given is: (10^x) * (10^5) = (100)^4

We can simplify this:
1. Left side: 10^(x+5) by exponent rules
2. Right side: (10^2)^4 = 10^8 since 100 = 10^2

So the equation simplifies to: 10^(x+5) = 10^8

Since the bases are equal, we can set the exponents equal:
x + 5 = 8
x = 3

The ground truth answer is 3, which is correct. The proposed answer is 4, which is incorrect.
