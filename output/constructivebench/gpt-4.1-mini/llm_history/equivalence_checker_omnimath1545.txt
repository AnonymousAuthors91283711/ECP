Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n * (n - 1)
Proposed Answer: fun n => 2 * n - 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the maximum size of a set of points in ℕ×ℕ with certain properties:
   - All points are distinct (first condition)
   - Both coordinates are non-decreasing in sequence (second condition)
   - Both x-coordinates and y-coordinates are all distinct (third and fourth conditions)

2. This is essentially asking for the maximum number of points in a grid where both coordinates are strictly increasing (since if any coordinate were equal, it would violate the distinctness conditions).

3. The ground truth answer n*(n-1) makes sense because:
   - For the first coordinate, we can choose any n distinct values
   - For the second coordinate, we can choose any n-1 distinct values (since we need to maintain strict increase in both coordinates)
   - The maximum would indeed be n*(n-1)

4. The proposed answer 2*n-2 is incorrect because:
   - For n=2: ground truth gives 2*1=2, proposed gives 2*2-2=2 (matches)
   - For n=3: ground truth gives 3*2=6, proposed gives 4 (doesn't match)
   - For n=4: ground truth gives 4*3=12, proposed gives 6 (doesn't match)

The proposed answer only matches for n=2 but fails for larger n.
