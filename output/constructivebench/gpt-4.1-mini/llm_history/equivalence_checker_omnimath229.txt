Ground Truth Answer: {0, (fun x => x ^ 2)}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ x, f x = c * x}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for all real-valued functions f: ℝ → ℝ that satisfy a specific functional equation involving f evaluated at different points.

2. The ground truth answer gives two solutions:
   - The zero function (f(x) = 0)
   - The quadratic function (f(x) = x²)

3. The proposed answer suggests all linear functions (f(x) = c*x for some constant c)

Testing the proposed solution:
- For f(x) = 0 (c=0): This satisfies the ground truth and the equation
- For f(x) = x²: This is in ground truth but not in proposed answer
- For f(x) = c*x (c≠0): Let's test if these satisfy the original equation. Plugging in x=1,y=0 gives c² = c² which holds, but testing x=1,y=1 gives (c+1)*c*(-2) + (c+1)*c*2 = (2c)² → 0 = 4c² → c=0. So only c=0 works.

The proposed answer incorrectly includes all linear functions when only the zero function works from that class, and misses the quadratic solution.
