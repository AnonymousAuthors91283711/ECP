abbrev omnimath2071_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2071 :
  ∑ n in Ico (10^2018) (10^2019), (digits 10 n).toFinset.card = omnimath2071_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 9 * (10^2019 - 9^2019)
Proposed Answer: 9 * 10^(2018)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
- We're summing over all n from 10²⁰¹⁸ to 10²⁰¹⁹-1 (numbers with exactly 2019 digits)
- For each number, we count the number of distinct digits it contains (via (digits 10 n).toFinset.card)
- We need to find the total sum of distinct digit counts across all these numbers

Ground Truth Answer Analysis:
- 9 * (10^2019 - 9^2019) makes sense because:
  - There are 9*10²⁰¹⁸ numbers (9 choices for first digit, 10 for others)
  - For each number, expected distinct digits is 9*(1 - (9/10)^2019)
  - Multiply counts by expectation gives 9*10²⁰¹⁸ * (1 - (9/10)^2019) * 10 = 9*(10^2019 - 9^2019)

Proposed Answer Analysis:
- 9 * 10^2018 is just 1/10th of the total count of numbers
- This doesn't account for the probability of digits appearing
- It's missing the crucial (1 - (9/10)^2019) probability factor

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't properly account for the probability of digits appearing in the numbers. The ground truth answer correctly models this probability.
