Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting the number of 2x2 Boolean matrices (functions from Fin 2 × Fin 2 → Bool) that satisfy certain conditions about their "blank" (false) entries.

2. The conditions are:
   - Diagonal entries must be blank (m 0 0 and m 1 1 are false)
   - At least one of the anti-diagonal entries must be blank (m 0 1 or m 1 0 is false)
   - If both anti-diagonal entries are blank, then the corresponding diagonal entry must also be blank (this creates dependencies between the entries)

3. Let's enumerate all possible valid matrices:
   a) m 0 0 = false, m 1 1 = false, m 0 1 = false, m 1 0 = true
   b) m 0 0 = false, m 1 1 = false, m 0 1 = true, m 1 0 = false
   c) m 0 0 = false, m 1 1 = false, m 0 1 = false, m 1 0 = false

   These are the only 3 matrices that satisfy all conditions. The proposed answer 4 is incorrect because it counts an extra invalid case.
