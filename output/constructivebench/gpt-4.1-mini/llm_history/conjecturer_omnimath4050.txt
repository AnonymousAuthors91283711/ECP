The errors come from the fact that `n` is used inside the set comprehension but is never introduced with an existential quantifier. To fix this, `n` must be included explicitly in the existential quantifiers along with `a` and `b`. Also, parentheses should be added to clearly group conditions since ∨ and ∧ have different precedences.

Considering the problem's description, the class of functions such that f(xy) = P(f(x), f(y)) where P is a polynomial in two variables typically includes power functions and logarithmic functions (up to affine transformations), under strict monotonicity/anti-monotonicity conditions.

Hence, a correct formalization would quantify over `n : ℕ` in the exponent case, and include the logarithmic case as a separate disjunct, all under the condition that `a ≠ 0`.

The corrected form is:

<<<
{f | ∃ (a b : ℝ), a ≠ 0 ∧ ((f = fun x => a * Real.log x + b) ∨ 
  ∃ (n : ℕ), n ≥ 1 ∧ f = fun x => a * x ^ n + b) }
