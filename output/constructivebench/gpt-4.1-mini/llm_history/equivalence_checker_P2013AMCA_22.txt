Ground Truth Answer: 11 / 30
Proposed Answer: (40 : ℚ) / 90
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting 6-digit palindromic numbers (numbers that read the same backward) and finding what fraction of them are divisible by 11 (with the quotient also being a 6-digit palindrome).

2. For 6-digit palindromes:
   - The general form is abccba where a,b,c are digits (a ≠ 0)
   - Total possible palindromes: 9 (choices for a) × 10 (b) × 10 (c) = 900

3. For "good" palindromes (divisible by 11 with palindromic quotient):
   - The ground truth answer is 11/30, which would correspond to 330/900 palindromes
   - The proposed answer is 40/90, which simplifies to 400/900

4. The proposed answer (400/900) is different from the ground truth (330/900). The proposed answer overcounts the number of valid palindromes divisible by 11 with palindromic quotients.
