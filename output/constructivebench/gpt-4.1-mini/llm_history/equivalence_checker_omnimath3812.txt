Ground Truth Answer: {fun x : ℝ => x}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℝ, (f = fun x => x + c) ∧ c = 0}
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The ground truth answer states that the only solution is the identity function f(x) = x.

2. The proposed answer describes a set of functions where f(x) = x + c with the constraint that c must be 0. This is equivalent to saying f(x) = x.

3. Both answers are describing exactly the same solution - the identity function. The proposed answer just expresses it in a more verbose way by introducing a constant c that must be 0.

4. The proposed answer's formulation is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth, since "f(x) = x + c ∧ c = 0" simplifies to "f(x) = x".
