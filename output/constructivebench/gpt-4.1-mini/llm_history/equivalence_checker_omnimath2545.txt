Ground Truth Answer: 163/256
Proposed Answer: (choose 8 4 : ℚ) * (1/2)^8 + (choose 8 5 : ℚ) * (1/2)^8 + (choose 8 6 : ℚ) * (1/2)^8 + (choose 8 7 : ℚ) * (1/2)^8 + (choose 8 8 : ℚ) * (1/2)^8
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is calculating a sum from k=0 to 8 where:
- For k ≥ 4, we add (8 choose k) * (1/2)^8
- For k < 4, we add 0

The ground truth answer is 163/256.

The proposed answer expands the sum explicitly for k=4 to k=8:
(8 choose 4)/256 + (8 choose 5)/256 + (8 choose 6)/256 + (8 choose 7)/256 + (8 choose 8)/256

Let's verify:
- (8 choose 4) = 70
- (8 choose 5) = 56
- (8 choose 6) = 28
- (8 choose 7) = 8
- (8 choose 8) = 1
Total numerator = 70 + 56 + 28 + 8 + 1 = 163
Denominator is 256 for all terms.

So the proposed answer equals 163/256, which matches the ground truth.
