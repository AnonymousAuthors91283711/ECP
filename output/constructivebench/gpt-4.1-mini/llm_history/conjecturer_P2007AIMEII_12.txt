<<<348>>> 
-- Explanation: Given x(n) = 3^k_n strictly increasing and sum of log_3(x n) over 8 terms = 308 means sum k_n = 308. The bounds on log_3 of sum x n suggest sum k_n is just above 56*log_3. The pattern implies x(14) = 3^14, so log_3(x 14) = 14; but the problem sum is 308, fitting a sequence with steps k_n = 1,2,...,14,21,55, etc. The total sum matches 308 with x 14 = 3^14, so the answer in ℝ is 348.
