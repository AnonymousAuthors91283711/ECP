abbrev P2015AMCB_2_answer : ℕ × ℕ → ℕ × ℕ := sorry
theorem P2015AMCB_2 : P2015AMCB_2_answer (13, 0) = (15, 30) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun (startHour, startMin) => 
    let startTime := startHour * 60 + startMin
    let endSecondTask := 14 * 60 + 40
    let duration := (endSecondTask - startTime) / 2
    let totalDuration := 3 * duration
    let finishTime := startTime + totalDuration
    (finishTime / 60, finishTime % 60)
Proposed Answer: fun p => (p.1 + 2, p.1 * 2 + p.2 * 3)
Let's analyze the problem and the two answers:

1. The ground truth answer calculates:
   - Converts start time to minutes
   - Calculates half the time between start and 14:40
   - Multiplies by 3 for total duration
   - Adds to start time and converts back to hours/minutes

2. The proposed answer simply:
   - Adds 2 to the hour component
   - Multiplies hour by 2 and minute by 3 and sums them

Testing with input (13,0):
- Ground truth: (15,30) [correct]
- Proposed: (15,26) [incorrect]

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth's calculations and gives wrong results. The transformation is completely different and incorrect.

<<<False>>>
