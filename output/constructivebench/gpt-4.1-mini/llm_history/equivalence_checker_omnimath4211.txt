Ground Truth Answer: fun n => ((n ^ 4 * (n + 1) ^ 4) / 8)
Proposed Answer: fun n => ((n * (n + 1)) / 2)^5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves finding the GCD of two sums of powers (S(n) and S(3n)) where S(n) is defined as the sum of (p⁵ + p⁷) from p=1 to n.

2. The ground truth answer suggests the GCD is (n⁴ * (n+1)⁴)/8

3. The proposed answer suggests the GCD is ((n*(n+1))/2)⁵

Let's simplify both expressions:

Ground truth: (n⁴*(n+1)⁴)/8 = (n*(n+1)/2)⁴ * 2⁴/8 = (n*(n+1)/2)⁴ * 2

Proposed: (n*(n+1)/2)⁵

These are clearly different expressions. The ground truth has an exponent of 4 and an extra factor of 2, while the proposed answer has an exponent of 5. They are not equivalent.
