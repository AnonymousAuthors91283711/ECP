abbrev omnimath2787_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath2787 : 
  1/9 + 1/18 = 1/omnimath2787_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 9/2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find a rational number (ℚ) that satisfies the equation: 1/9 + 1/18 = 1/x

2. Calculating the left side:
   1/9 + 1/18 = 2/18 + 1/18 = 3/18 = 1/6

3. So the equation becomes: 1/6 = 1/x
   Therefore x must be 6.

4. The ground truth answer is indeed 6.

5. The proposed answer is 9/2, which is 4.5. 
   1/(9/2) = 2/9 ≈ 0.222..., while 1/6 ≈ 0.166...

The two answers are not equal, and the proposed answer does not satisfy the equation.
