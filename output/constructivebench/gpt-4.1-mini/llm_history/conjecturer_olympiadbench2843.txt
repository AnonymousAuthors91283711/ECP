    number % 11 = 0 ∧ s = A.val + B.val} 
  olympiadbench2843_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<9>>> 
Explanation: The number formed is of the form A A B 2 0 1 8, divisible by 11. Using divisibility rule for 11, the maximum sum A.val + B.val satisfying the condition is 9.
