Ground Truth Answer: 4/9
Proposed Answer: 20 / 49
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating a probability where:
   - blue = 5
   - red = 5
   - total = blue + red = 10

2. The favorable cases calculation:
   - favorable = 2 * (5*4 + 5*4) = 2*(20+20) = 80
   - This counts ordered pairs of same-color balls (blue or red)

3. The possible cases:
   - possible = 10*9 = 90 (ordered pairs of any balls)

4. Therefore, the probability should be 80/90 = 8/18 = 4/9

The proposed answer 20/49 is incorrect because:
- It seems to incorrectly calculate favorable as 2*(5*5 + 5*5) = 100
- And possible as 10*10 = 100
- Leading to 100/100 = 1 (which is clearly wrong)
- Then somehow arrives at 20/49 which doesn't match either correct or incorrect calculation

<<<False>>>
