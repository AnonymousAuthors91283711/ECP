abbrev omnimath2152_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath2152 :
  {(a, b) : ℕ × ℕ | a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ (2 * a + 1) ∣ (3 * b - 1) ∧ (2 * b + 1) ∣ (3 * a - 1)} = omnimath2152_answer ↔ True := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 2), (12, 17), (17, 12)}
Proposed Answer: { (a, b) | ∃ k : ℕ, (a, b) = (3 * k + 2, 2 * k + 1) }
<<<False>>>
