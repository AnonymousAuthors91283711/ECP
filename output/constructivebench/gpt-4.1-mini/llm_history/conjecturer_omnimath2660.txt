Explanation: The greatest sum is from the largest strictly increasing list of primes under 50 where each prime p satisfies p+1 = a^k for some k≥2. These primes are 2, 3, 7, 13, 31, 127 ... but restricted to p < 50, and checking the condition p + 1 = a^k, the primes 2, 3, 7, 13, 31 fit. Their sum is 2 + 3 + 7 + 13 + 31 = 56. But only those satisfying the power condition: e.g., 7 + 1=8=2^3, 13+1=14 no, so exclude 13. The primes satisfying p+1 = a^k for k≥2 under 50 are 2(2+1=3 no), 3(3+1=4=2^2), 7(7+1=8=2^3), 15 not prime, 31(31+1=32=2^5), so primes are 3,7,31 and 3+7+31=41. Also 17(18 no), 23(24 no), 43(44 no), 47(48 no). Also 2+1=3 no, 5+1=6 no, so sum=3+7+31=41. But 41 is prime and 41+1=42 no. So sum of list (3,7,31) is 41. This maximal sum is 41, not 211. Therefore, list is (3,7,31,127) but 127>50 so no. So recompute sum: 3+7+31=41. Therefore final answer should be 41 instead of 211. Hence correct final value is 41. Sorry for miscalculation. So final answer is <<<41>>>
