theorem P2021AMCA_2 (a b : ℝ) :
    sqrt (a^2 + b^2) = a + b ↔ P2021AMCA_2_answer a b := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => a * b = 0 ∧ a + b ≥ 0
Proposed Answer: fun a b => a ≥ 0 ∧ b ≥ 0 ∧ a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground Truth: a*b = 0 ∧ a + b ≥ 0
This means either a=0 or b=0, and their sum is non-negative.

Proposed Answer: a ≥ 0 ∧ b ≥ 0 ∧ a² + b² = (a + b)²
Let's simplify the last condition:
a² + b² = a² + 2ab + b² ⇒ 0 = 2ab ⇒ ab = 0
So the proposed answer simplifies to: a ≥ 0 ∧ b ≥ 0 ∧ ab = 0

Now compare with ground truth:
- Both require ab = 0
- Ground truth requires a + b ≥ 0
- Proposed answer requires a ≥ 0 ∧ b ≥ 0 (which implies a + b ≥ 0)

However, the proposed answer is more restrictive:
- It excludes cases like (a=5, b=0) [allowed by both]
- It excludes cases like (a=-3, b=0) [allowed by ground truth since -3+0=-3≥0 is false, but proposed answer would reject because a=-3<0]
- It excludes cases like (a=0, b=-4) [similar to above]

The proposed answer only allows non-negative a or b (with one being zero), while ground truth allows any a,b as long as one is zero and their sum is non-negative.
