theorem omnimath218 (x y z : ℝ) (hx : 1 ≤ x) (hy : 1 ≤ y) (hz : 1 ≤ z) :
  min (sqrt (x + x * y * z)) (min (sqrt (y + x * y * z)) (sqrt (z + x * y * z))) = 
  sqrt (x - 1) + sqrt (y - 1) + sqrt (z - 1) ↔

Ground Truth Answer: fun c => ((c^2 + c - 1) / c^2, c / (c - 1), c)
Proposed Answer: fun c : ℝ => (c^2 / (c - 1), c^2 / (c - 1), c^2 / (c - 1))
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a condition when the minimum of three square root expressions equals the sum of three other square roots.

2. The ground truth answer provides a tuple where the three components are different functions of c: ((c² + c - 1)/c², c/(c - 1), c)

3. The proposed answer gives a tuple where all three components are identical: (c²/(c - 1), c²/(c - 1), c²/(c - 1))

Key observations:
- The ground truth answer has three distinct components, while the proposed answer has identical components
- The proposed answer would only work in the trivial case where x = y = z, which isn't what the ground truth suggests
- The forms are fundamentally different, not just algebraically equivalent expressions
