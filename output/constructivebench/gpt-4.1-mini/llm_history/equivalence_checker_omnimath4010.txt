Ground Truth Answer: {P | ∃ (d : ℕ) (c : ℤ), P = X ^ d + C c ∨ P = - (X ^ d + C c) ∧ d > 0}
Proposed Answer: { P : ℤ[X] | ∃ (c : ℤ) (d : ℤ), P = C c * (X - C d) ^ 0 ∨ P = C c}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the set of integer polynomials P where if P evaluates to integers at two real points s and t, then it must also evaluate to an integer at their product s*t.

2. The ground truth answer correctly identifies that these are essentially the monic or anti-monic polynomials of the form X^d + c or -(X^d + c) where d > 0. These are the only polynomials that satisfy the given condition because:
   - They are the only ones where integer evaluation at s and t guarantees integer evaluation at s*t
   - The d > 0 condition excludes constant polynomials which trivially satisfy the condition but don't fit the form

3. The proposed answer suggests polynomials that are either:
   - Constant multiples of (X - d)^0 (which is just constant polynomials)
   - Or pure constant polynomials

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It only includes constant polynomials (since (X - C d)^0 = 1)
- It misses all the non-constant polynomials that satisfy the condition
- The ground truth specifically includes non-constant polynomials with d > 0
