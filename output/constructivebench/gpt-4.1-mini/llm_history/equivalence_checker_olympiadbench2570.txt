Ground Truth Answer: {(27, 20, 13), (18, 20, 22)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b, c) | b - a = c - b ∧ a + b + c = 60 ∧ ∃ r : ℤ, (a - 2) * r = b ∧ b * r = c + 3}
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The proposed answer is exactly the set of all integer triples (a, b, c) that satisfy the given conditions, which is precisely what the ground truth answer provides (the two specific solutions that satisfy these conditions). The proposed answer is just a more general description of the solution set, while the ground truth enumerates the actual solutions. They are equivalent representations of the same mathematical truth.
