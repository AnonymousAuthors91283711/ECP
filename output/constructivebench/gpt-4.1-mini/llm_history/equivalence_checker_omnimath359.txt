Ground Truth Answer: 0
Proposed Answer: 201320132013 - 201220122012
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem presents a complex arithmetic expression involving large numbers and asks to simplify it.

2. The ground truth answer is 0, meaning the two sides of the equation should be equal.

3. The proposed answer suggests that the simplification results in (201320132013 - 201220122012).

4. Let's examine the numbers more closely:
   - 20122012 = 2012 * 10000 + 2012 = 2012 * 10001
   - 201320132013 = 2013 * 100000000 + 2013 * 10000 + 2013 = 2013 * 100010001
   - Similarly for the other large numbers

5. When we factor all terms properly, we find that both sides of the original equation are indeed equal, making the difference 0.

6. The proposed answer (201320132013 - 201220122012) is not equal to 0 (it equals 100010001), so it's incorrect.
