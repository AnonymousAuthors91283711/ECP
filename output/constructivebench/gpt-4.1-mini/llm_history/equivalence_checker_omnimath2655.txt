Ground Truth Answer: 11
Proposed Answer: 6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal number of digits (in base 10) that the absolute value of the product (n-1001)(n-2001)...(n-3003) can have, given that the product is positive.

2. The ground truth answer is 11, which suggests that the minimal product occurs when n is between two of the given roots, making the product as small as possible while still being positive.

3. The proposed answer is 6, which would correspond to a much smaller product. This seems incorrect because:
   - The smallest possible positive product would occur when n is between 2001 and 2002 or between 3002 and 3003
   - Even in these cases, the product would be much larger than a 6-digit number

4. For example, if n = 2001.5 (midway between 2001 and 2002), the product would be approximately (1000.5)(0.5)(0.5)(999.5)(999)(998.5) which is clearly much larger than any 6-digit number.
