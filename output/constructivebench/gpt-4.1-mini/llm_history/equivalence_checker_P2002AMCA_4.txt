Ground Truth Answer: 60
Proposed Answer: 36
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find a unique real number x between 0 and 90 that satisfies the equation: (90 - x) = 0.25 * (180 - x)

2. Let's solve the equation:
   90 - x = 45 - 0.25x
   90 - 45 = x - 0.25x
   45 = 0.75x
   x = 45 / 0.75
   x = 60

3. The ground truth answer is indeed 60, which correctly solves the equation.

4. The proposed answer is 36, which does not satisfy the equation:
   (90 - 36) = 54
   0.25 * (180 - 36) = 0.25 * 144 = 36
   54 ≠ 36

<<<False>>>
