    (∑ k in range 12, logb 8 (p.1 * (p.2 : ℝ)^k)) = 2006 } = P2006AIMEI_9_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The expression inside the sum simplifies as log base 8 of p.1 plus k times log base 8 of p.2, summed over k=0 to 11, yielding 12 * log base 8 p.1 + 66 * log base 8 p.2 (since sum k=0 to 11 of k is 66). Setting this equal to 2006 means p.1^{12} * p.2^{66} = 8^{2006} = 2^{6018}. We want the number of (p.1, p.2) with p.1, p.2 ≥1 and integer, such that p.1^{12} * p.2^{66} = 2^{6018}. By uniqueness of prime factorization, p.1 and p.2 are powers of 2 only, say p.1 = 2^a, p.2 = 2^b with a,b≥0. Then 12a + 66b = 6018; a,b≥0 integers. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to 12a + 66b = 6018 is the number of nonnegative integer b with 12a = 6018 - 66b >=0 and divisible by 12, i.e., for b=0..(6018/66), 6018 - 66b divisible by 12. Since 66b mod 12 is (6b mod 12), and 6018 mod 12 = 6, so 6 - 6b mod 12 = 0, so 6b mod 12=6, so b is odd. The number of odd integers b between 0 and floor(6018/66)=91 inclusive is (91+1)/2=46. So the answer is 46.
