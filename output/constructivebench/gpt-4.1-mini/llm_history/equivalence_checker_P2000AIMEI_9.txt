Ground Truth Answer: 25
Proposed Answer: 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two distinct triples (x₁,y₁,z₁) and (x₂,y₂,z₂) with identical sums, sum of squares, and sum of cubes. We need to find y₁ + y₂.

2. The ground truth answer is 25, which comes from solving the system of equations and finding that the y-values of the two triples must satisfy y₁ + y₂ = 25.

3. The proposed answer is 3, which is significantly different from 25 and doesn't match the expected result from solving the system.

4. The problem involves symmetric polynomials and Newton's identities, and the correct solution leads to 25, not 3.
