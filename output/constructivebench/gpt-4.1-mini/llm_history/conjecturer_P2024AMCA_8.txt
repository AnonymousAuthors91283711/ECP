The equation log(sin(3θ)) + log(cos(2θ)) = 0 implies sin(3θ) * cos(2θ) = 1. Since both sin(3θ) and cos(2θ) lie between -1 and 1, their product equals 1 only when both are ±1, and with matching signs, i.e., sin(3θ) = ±1 and cos(2θ) = ±1 such that their product = 1.

sin(3θ) = ±1 occurs at θ = (π/6 + k * π/3) for integers k, total 6 values in [0, 2π].

cos(2θ) = ±1 occurs at θ = (k * π/2) for integers k, total 5 values in [0, 2π].

Matching their signs so that their product = 1 only happens for θ satisfying both conditions.

Counting distinct θ in [0, 2π] solutions gives 4.

Therefore, the cardinality is 4.
