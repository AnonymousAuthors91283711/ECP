Ground Truth Answer: 3 / 5
Proposed Answer: 1/2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find the value of p (between 0 and 1) that makes the two binomial probability expressions equal.

2. First, let's compute the binomial coefficients:
   - choose(4,2) = 6
   - choose(4,3) = 4

3. The equation becomes:
   6 * p² * (1-p)² = 4 * p³ * (1-p)

4. Simplifying (assuming p ≠ 0 and p ≠ 1):
   6(1-p) = 4p
   6 - 6p = 4p
   6 = 10p
   p = 6/10 = 3/5

The ground truth answer (3/5) is correct, while the proposed answer (1/2) is incorrect. The calculations clearly show that p must be 3/5, not 1/2.
