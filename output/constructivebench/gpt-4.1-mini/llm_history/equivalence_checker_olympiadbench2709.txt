Ground Truth Answer: 1525
Proposed Answer: 1000
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the least natural number m in the form m = 25*p where p satisfies several inequalities involving a and p.

2. The inequalities can be simplified to:
   - 100 < a + p < 200
   - 1000 < 2a + 12p < 2000

3. For m = 25*p, the ground truth answer is 1525 (which means p = 61).

4. The proposed answer is 1000 (which would mean p = 40).

5. Testing p=40 in the inequalities:
   - From 100 < a + p < 200, a would be between 61 and 160
   - But 2a + 12p must be >1000, so 2a > 1000 - 480 = 520 → a > 260
   - This contradicts a < 160 from the first inequality

6. Therefore, p=40 (m=1000) doesn't satisfy all conditions, while p=61 (m=1525) does.
