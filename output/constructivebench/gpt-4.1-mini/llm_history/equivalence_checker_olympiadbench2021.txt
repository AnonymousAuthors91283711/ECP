Ground Truth Answer: 1344
Proposed Answer: 1011
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n that has three distinct positive divisors (d1, d2, d3) whose sum is 2022.

2. The ground truth answer is 1344. Let's verify this:
   - Divisors of 1344: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 16, 21, 24, 28, 32, 42, 48, 56, 64, 84, 96, 112, 168, 192, 224, 336, 448, 672, 1344
   - We can find three distinct divisors that sum to 2022: 672 + 1344 + 6 = 2022
   - 1348 is indeed the smallest such number

3. The proposed answer is 1011:
   - Divisors of 1011: 1, 3, 337, 1011
   - The only possible sums of three distinct divisors are 1+3+337=341 and 1+3+1011=1015, neither equals 2022
   - Therefore, 1011 cannot be the correct answer

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the problem's conditions.
