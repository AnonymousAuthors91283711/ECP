Ground Truth Answer: 360
Proposed Answer: 60
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting the number of functions from Fin 5 → Fin 10 (i.e., 5-digit numbers where each digit is from 0-9) that satisfy:
   - First digit is not 0 (d 0 ≠ 0)
   - Product of all digits equals 180 (∏ d i = 180)

2. First, factorize 180 = 2² × 3² × 5

3. The proposed answer is 60, while the ground truth is 360.

4. To get 180, the digits must include:
   - Exactly one 5 (since 5 is a prime factor)
   - The remaining digits must multiply to 36 (2² × 3²)
   - Possible combinations for the other 4 digits that multiply to 36:
     * 9,4,1,1
     * 9,2,2,1
     * 6,6,1,1
     * 6,3,2,1
     * 4,3,3,1
     * 3,3,2,2
     * etc.

5. For each combination, we need to calculate permutations:
   - For example, for 9,2,2,1: 5 digits total (including the 5), with 2 repeated digits (the 2s)
   - Number of arrangements: 5! / 2! = 60
   - But we have multiple such cases, and the total sums to 360

6. The proposed answer 60 is likely considering only one case (like 9,2,2,1 with 5) but missing all other valid combinations.
