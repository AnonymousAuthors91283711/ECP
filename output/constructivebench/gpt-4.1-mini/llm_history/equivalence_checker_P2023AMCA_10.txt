Ground Truth Answer: 36
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. We have two positive real numbers x and y with:
   - y³ = x²
   - (y - x)² = 4y²

2. From the second equation (h2):
   (y - x)² = 4y²
   => y - x = ±2y
   This gives two cases:
   a) y - x = 2y => -x = y => x = -y (invalid since x,y > 0)
   b) y - x = -2y => 3y = x

3. Substitute x = 3y into h1:
   y³ = (3y)² => y³ = 9y²
   Since y > 0, we can divide by y²:
   y = 9

4. Then x = 3y = 27
   So x + y = 27 + 9 = 36

The ground truth answer is 36, while the proposed answer is 4. These are clearly different.
