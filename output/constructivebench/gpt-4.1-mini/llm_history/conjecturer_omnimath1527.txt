The problem characterizes all natural numbers \( n > 0 \) such that for every integer \( k \), there exists an integer \( a \) with \( a^3 + a \equiv k \pmod{n} \). This means the map \( a \mapsto a^3 + a \) is surjective mod \( n \).

Checking small values shows the set includes \( 1 \) and \( 3 \), and excludes others like \( 2 \) or \( 4 \). The enumeration hints the set is exactly the multiples of 3 or 1 (where trivially all residues mod 1 occur).

Therefore, the answer set is all positive multiples of 3 plus 1, namely \(\{ n \in \mathbb{N} \mid n = 1 \text{ or } 3 \mid n \}\).

In Lean, this corresponds to:

<<<{n : ℕ | n = 1 ∨ 3 ∣ n}>>>
