Ground Truth Answer: 0.28
Proposed Answer: 2 * (0.2 * 0.1 + 0.3 * 0.2 + 0.4 * 0.2)
Let's analyze this step by step:

1. The problem asks for the maximum value of p = 2*(f0*f5 + f1*f4 + f2*f3) under given constraints.

2. The ground truth answer is 0.28.

3. The proposed answer calculates:
   2 * (0.2 * 0.1 + 0.3 * 0.2 + 0.4 * 0.2)
   = 2 * (0.02 + 0.06 + 0.08)
   = 2 * 0.16
   = 0.32

4. The proposed answer (0.32) is greater than the ground truth (0.28), which violates the "IsGreatest" condition in the theorem.

5. The proposed answer doesn't satisfy all constraints:
   - f0 = 0.2 (f0² = 0.04 ✔)
   - f5 = 0.1 (f5² = 0.01 ✔)
   - But sum of all f_i = 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.4 + 0.2 + ? + 0.1 > 1 (violates ∑f_i=1)
