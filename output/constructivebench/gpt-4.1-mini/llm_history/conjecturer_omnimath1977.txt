The given condition is \( 2^x = 3 \), from which we want to find a closed form for \( 4^{3x + 2} \).

Rewriting:
\[
4^{3x + 2} = (2^2)^{3x + 2} = 2^{2(3x + 2)} = 2^{6x + 4} = 2^4 \cdot 2^{6x} = 16 \cdot (2^x)^6 = 16 \cdot 3^6 = 16 \cdot 729 = 11664.
\]

Hence,
\[
\text{omnimath1977\_answer} = 11664.
\]

This is a constant real number, so the Lean expression should just be the numeral `11664` of type `ℝ`.

The error comes from attempts to exponentiate `3^(3 * (log 3 / log 2))`, likely due to type mismatches and Lean disliking non-integer exponents with the given notation. The whole expression reduces to a constant, so no need for logarithms or powers in the answer.

<<<11664>>>
