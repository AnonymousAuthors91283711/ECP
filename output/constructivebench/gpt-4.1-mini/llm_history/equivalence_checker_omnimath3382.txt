noncomputable abbrev omnimath3382_answer : ℕ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3382 (k : ℕ) (hk : k > 0) :
  omnimath3382_answer k = 1/6 + 1/(3 * (-2)^k) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun k => 1/6 + 1/(3 * (-2)^k)
Proposed Answer: fun k => 1/6 + 1/(3 * (-2 : ℝ)^k)
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but differs in the type annotation. The ground truth answer works for any type where division and exponentiation are defined (likely ℝ), while the proposed answer explicitly casts -2 to ℝ. They are functionally equivalent but differ in their type specification.
