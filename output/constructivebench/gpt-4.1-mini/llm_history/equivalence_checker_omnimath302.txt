Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 2 * n - 1
Proposed Answer: fun n => n * (2 * n - 1)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
This is a combinatorics problem about finding the maximum size m of a set Sm with certain intersection properties. The conditions describe a finite projective plane-like structure where:
- Sm has m*n elements
- There are 2*n subsets (t ∈ T), each of size m
- Any two distinct subsets intersect in at most 1 element
- Each element of Sm appears in exactly 2 subsets

Ground Truth Answer (2n-1):
This makes sense because:
1. Each of the 2n subsets has m elements
2. Each element appears in exactly 2 subsets
3. The total number of element occurrences is 2n * m (from subsets) and also 2 * |Sm| = 2mn (from elements)
4. The intersection condition suggests a projective plane construction where m = 2n-1 is the correct maximum

Proposed Answer (n*(2n-1)):
This would be the total number of elements (mn) if m=2n-1, but the problem asks for m itself, not mn. The proposed answer incorrectly gives the product rather than the value of m.

Conclusion:
The proposed answer is incorrect as it gives a different quantity than what's being asked for.
