Ground Truth Answer: 2500
Proposed Answer: (44 * 100000 + 50000) / 1800
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the integer distance (in miles) that minimizes the absolute difference between the calculated distance (total steps divided by steps per mile) and possible integer answers.

2. Calculation:
   - totalSteps = 44 * 100000 + 50000 = 4,450,000 steps
   - stepsPerMile = 1800
   - distance = 4,450,000 / 1800 ≈ 2472.222...

3. The integer that minimizes the absolute difference to 2472.222... is 2472, but:
   - The ground truth answer is 2500
   - The proposed answer is the expression (44 * 100000 + 50000)/1800 which evaluates to 2472.222...

4. The ground truth answer (2500) is actually further from the calculated distance than 2472, so it appears incorrect. The proposed answer gives the exact calculation but not rounded to the nearest integer.

<<<False>>>
