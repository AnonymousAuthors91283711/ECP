Explanation:
The problem's proposed answer must be a natural number (ℕ), but the candidate incorrectly tries to define olympiadbench2770_answer in terms of variables a, b, c, d that are only introduced later in the theorem context. Instead, olympiadbench2770_answer should be a fixed natural number that does not depend on these variables. Given that the minimal (a + b) or (c + d) is 1, this suggests the minimal sum achievable under the given factorization is 1.

Therefore, the correct Lean definition should be simply:

<<<1>>>
