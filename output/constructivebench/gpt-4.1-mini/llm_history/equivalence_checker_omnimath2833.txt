Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => (2 * x + 3 * y) / (3 * x - 2 * y)
Proposed Answer: fun x y => ((x - y) / (x + y) - 5) * (3 * x - 2 * y)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us an equation (x-y)/(x+y) = 5 and asks us to find a relationship between x and y.

2. The ground truth answer provides an expression (2x + 3y)/(3x - 2y) which equals 0 when the original equation holds.

3. The proposed answer is ((x-y)/(x+y) - 5)*(3x - 2y), which equals 0 when either:
   - (x-y)/(x+y) = 5 (which matches our given condition), or
   - 3x - 2y = 0 (which is explicitly excluded by hdenom)

While both expressions equal 0 under the given conditions, they are not equivalent functions:
- The ground truth gives a specific ratio that must be 0
- The proposed answer gives a product that equals 0 under the given condition

They are not mathematically equivalent expressions, though both satisfy the theorem's conclusion under the given constraints.
