theorem omnimath3053 (g : ℝ) (h : g > 0) : 
    g^2 - 6^2 = 45 ↔ g = omnimath3053_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<sqrt (81)>>
  
Explanation: The equation g² - 6² = 45 implies g² = 81, so g = ±9. Since h : g > 0, the only solution is g = 9 = sqrt(81). Thus, omnimath3053_answer := sqrt (81).[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
