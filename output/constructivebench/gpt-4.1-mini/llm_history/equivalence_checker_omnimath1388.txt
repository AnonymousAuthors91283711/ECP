Ground Truth Answer: -5892
Proposed Answer: 67
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves a system of equations with complex variables a,b,c and x,y,z, with specific relationships between them.

2. The ground truth answer is -5892, while the proposed answer is 67.

3. The problem involves cyclic symmetric equations and a constraint on x,y,z (x*y + y*z + z*x = 67 and x + y + z = 2010).

4. The proposed answer 67 matches one of the given values in the problem (the sum of pairwise products), but this is likely coincidental.

5. There's no obvious mathematical relationship between 67 and -5892 that would make them equivalent answers to this problem.

6. The ground truth answer (-5892) is more plausible as it's a more complex result that would come from solving the system of equations, while 67 is too simple and directly taken from the problem statement.
