Ground Truth Answer: {3}
Proposed Answer: { n : ℕ | ∃ m : ℕ, n = 2 * m^2 - 1 }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for natural numbers n ≥ 1 where there exists an integer k such that k² = n*2^(n+1) + 1.

2. Ground truth is {3}:
   - For n=3: 3*2^(4)+1 = 49 = 7², so it satisfies the condition
   - Checking n=1,2,4,5 shows they don't satisfy the equation

3. Proposed answer is numbers of form n = 2m² - 1:
   - This would include numbers like 1 (m=1), 7 (m=2), 17 (m=3), etc.
   - Only n=3 (when m=2) satisfies the original equation from the ground truth
   - Other numbers in this set (like 1,7,17) don't satisfy the original equation

The proposed answer includes many numbers that don't satisfy the original condition, while the ground truth is just {3}. The proposed answer is incorrect because it's too broad.
