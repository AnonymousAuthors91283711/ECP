Ground Truth Answer: 11
Proposed Answer: 19
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have two natural numbers x and y such that:
   - x * y = 24
   - x - y = 5

2. We need to find x + y

Let's solve the system of equations:
From x - y = 5, we get x = y + 5
Substitute into first equation: (y + 5)*y = 24 => y² + 5y - 24 = 0
Solutions: y = [-5 ± √(25 + 96)]/2 = [-5 ± √121]/2 = [-5 ± 11]/2

Possible solutions:
y = (-5 + 11)/2 = 3 => x = 8
y = (-5 - 11)/2 = -8 (invalid since y must be natural number)

Only valid solution is x=8, y=3
Thus x + y = 11

The ground truth answer is correct (11), while the proposed answer is 19, which is incorrect.
