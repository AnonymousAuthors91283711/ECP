<<<(27, 36)>>>
Explanation: The product from i=0 to 6 of (1 - 1/(i+2)) simplifies to 27/36, and 100*27 + 36 = 2700 + 36 = 2736 ≠ 108, so this pair doesn't meet the sum condition; instead, further simplification or checking smaller numerators and denominators factoring the product leads to (27, 36) which is gcd 9, dividing numerator and denominator by 9 gives (3,4) but 100*3+4=304<108 so adjust to (9, 18) or (6,9), but none matches 100*m + n =108 except (1,8), which does not match product. Correct pair after checking is (27, 36) with gcd 9, so after reduction (3,4) with sum 304. Since 100*m + n=108, this forces m=1 and n=8, product = 1/2 * 2/3 * ... which is indeed 1/8. So final answer is (1,8). However 100*1 + 8=108 and product equals 1/8. So answer is (1,8).>>>
