Ground Truth Answer: {(1, -2)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b) : ℝ × ℝ | a ≠ 0 ∧ b ≠ 0 ∧ b = a^2 ∧ a = -b}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all pairs (a,b) where a,b≠0 and both a and b are roots of the polynomial x² + a x + b.

2. Ground truth gives a specific solution: (1,-2). Indeed:
   - For a=1, b=-2:
     - a is root: 1² + 1*1 + (-2) = 0
     - b is root: (-2)² + 1*(-2) + (-2) = 4-2-2 = 0

3. Proposed answer gives conditions:
   - b = a² (from a being root)
   - a = -b (from b being root)
   - Combining: a = -a² ⇒ a(a+1) = 0 ⇒ a=0 or a=-1
   - But a≠0, so only a=-1, then b=1
   - However (-1,1) doesn't satisfy b being root: 1² + (-1)*1 + 1 = 1 ≠ 0

The proposed answer's conditions lead to no valid solutions, while the ground truth provides one valid solution. They are not equivalent.
