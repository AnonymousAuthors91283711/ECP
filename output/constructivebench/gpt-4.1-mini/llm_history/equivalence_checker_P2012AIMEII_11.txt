Ground Truth Answer: (5, 8)
Proposed Answer: (2003, 3998)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves finding a unique rational number x that satisfies a functional equation involving 1001 iterations of f₁, with certain conditions on its numerator and denominator.

2. The ground truth answer (5,8) suggests the solution is x = 5/8.

3. The proposed answer (2003,3998) suggests x = 2003/3998.

4. Let's check if these could be equivalent:
   - 5/8 ≈ 0.625
   - 2003/3998 ≈ 0.50125
   - These are clearly different values.

5. The problem asks for a unique solution, so there can't be two different correct answers.

6. The proposed answer doesn't simplify to the ground truth answer (2003 and 3998 share common factors).
