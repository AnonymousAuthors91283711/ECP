The error occurs because Lean's `abbrev` definition expects a single expression rather than a `let ... in ...` block. To fix this, directly provide the numeric value computed by the expression rather than using `let` bindings inside an `abbrev`. 

Given the enumerated values `x = 45`, `y = 54`, and `m = 9`, the sum is `45 + 54 + 9 = 108`.

Thus, the clean Lean definition should be simply the number `108`.

<<<108>>>
