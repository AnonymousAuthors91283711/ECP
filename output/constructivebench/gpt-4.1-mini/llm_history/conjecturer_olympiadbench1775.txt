Explanation: The minimal sum attained by a bijection \(a: \{0,\ldots,n-1\} \to \{0,\ldots,n-1\}\) with summands \(\frac{a(i)}{i+1}\) is achieved by the identity permutation, giving \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \frac{i}{i+1} = n - H_n\) but since values are floors of this ratio (as val is ℕ), the minimal integral sum equals \(n\).
