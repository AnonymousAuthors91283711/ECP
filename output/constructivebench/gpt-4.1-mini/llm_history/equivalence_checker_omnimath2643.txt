Ground Truth Answer: 64 / 3
Proposed Answer: (18 : ℝ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. From the problem:
   - l = 3w (given)
   - Perimeter: 2(l + w) = k
   - Area: l * w = k

2. Substituting l = 3w into perimeter equation:
   2(3w + w) = k → 8w = k

3. Substituting into area equation:
   3w * w = k → 3w² = k

4. From perimeter we have w = k/8
   Substitute into area equation:
   3(k/8)² = k → 3k²/64 = k → 3k² - 64k = 0 → k(3k - 64) = 0

5. Since k > 0, we get 3k - 64 = 0 → k = 64/3

The ground truth answer (64/3) is correct, while the proposed answer (18) is incorrect. They are not equivalent.
