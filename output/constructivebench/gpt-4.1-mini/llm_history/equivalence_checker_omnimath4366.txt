Ground Truth Answer: { (x, y, z) | x = y ∧ y = z }
Proposed Answer: { (x, y, z) : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ | x > 0 ∧ y > 0 ∧ z > 0 ∧ x = y ∧ y = z }
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both specify that the equation holds if and only if x, y, and z are equal positive natural numbers. The proposed answer explicitly includes the positivity conditions (x > 0, y > 0, z > 0) which are already given in the problem statement, while the ground truth answer implicitly assumes these conditions from the context. The core condition x = y ∧ y = z is identical in both answers.
