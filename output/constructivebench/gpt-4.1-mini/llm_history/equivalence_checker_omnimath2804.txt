Ground Truth Answer: 20
Proposed Answer: 4
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting the number of sequences f: Fin 11 → ℝ satisfying:
   - Boundary conditions: f(0) = 4, f(10) = 1024
   - Recurrence relation: f(n) + f(n-1) = (5/2)√(f(n)f(n-1)) for n ∈ {1,...,10}

2. The recurrence relation suggests a geometric progression. Let's rewrite it:
   f(n)/f(n-1) = r (common ratio)
   Then the relation becomes: r + 1 = (5/2)√r
   Solving this quadratic gives r = 4 or r = 1/4

3. With two possible ratios at each step, but fixed endpoints, there's exactly one valid sequence that alternates between these ratios to go from 4 to 1024 in 10 steps.

4. The ground truth answer is 20 (mod 100), suggesting there are 20 valid sequences. This makes sense because at each of the 10 steps, we have a binary choice between two ratios, but the endpoint condition reduces this.

5. The proposed answer is 4, which is significantly different from 20 and doesn't match the expected count based on the problem's structure.
