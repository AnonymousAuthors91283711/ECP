Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b) | a = 1 ∧ b = 1}
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The ground truth answer {(1, 1)} and the proposed answer {(a, b) | a = 1 ∧ b = 1} are equivalent. Both answers specify exactly the same solution set containing only the pair (1, 1). The proposed answer uses set builder notation while the ground truth uses explicit enumeration, but they describe identical sets. The conditions a = 1 ∧ b = 1 in the proposed answer correspond exactly to the single element (1, 1) in the ground truth.
