The error arises because `div` is not written as a function call in Lean, but rather as an infix operator `a / b` for natural number division. The expression `(2007 div 4 + 1) * (2007 div 5 + 1)` is syntactically incorrect. The correct way is `2007 / 4` and `2007 / 5` for integer division. 

Ignoring the integer solution constraints, the problem is to maximize `(h+1)(v+1)` subject to `5h + 4v = 2007` with `h,v ∈ ℕ`. This is a classic optimization over lattice points under a linear constraint.

Since `5h + 4v = 2007`, for fixed integers, `h = (2007 - 4v)/5` must be integer. Because 2007 ≡ 2 mod 5 and 4v ≡ -2 mod 5, we can find `v` such that `4v ≡ 3 mod 5` (since -2 mod 5 = 3). The pattern of valid v's will be every 5 steps. Similarly for h.

However, the given formula `(2007 / 4 + 1) * (2007 / 5 + 1)` corresponds to the maximal rectangle formed if ignoring the divisibility constraints and taking the maximal numbers of `v` and `h`.

Hence, the proposed final answer in Lean should be:

`(2007 / 4 + 1) * (2007 / 5 + 1)`

This compiles if we write properly with spaces and parentheses as:

`(2007 / 4 + 1) * (2007 / 5 + 1)`

So correcting the code to:

`abbrev P2007AIMEII_8_answer : ℕ := (2007 / 4 + 1) * (2007 / 5 + 1)`

This should compile.

<<<(2007 / 4 + 1) * (2007 / 5 + 1)>>>
