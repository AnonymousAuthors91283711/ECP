Ground Truth Answer: 1469
Proposed Answer: 1444
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the greatest natural number y that satisfies several conditions involving squares of numbers between 1300-1400 (d) and 1400-1500 (s).

2. Key conditions:
   - Both d and s must be perfect squares
   - y must be between max(d,s) and min(d+110, s+110)
   - Both y-d and y-s must be perfect squares

3. Ground truth is 1469:
   - This comes from d=1369 (37²) and s=1444 (38²)
   - y=1469 satisfies:
     * 1469 ∈ [1444, min(1369+110,1444+110)] = [1444,1479]
     * 1469-1369 = 100 (10²)
     * 1469-1444 = 25 (5²)

4. Proposed answer is 1444:
   - 1444 is itself a perfect square (38²)
   - But for y to be valid, it must be greater than or equal to both d and s
   - Since s ≥ 1400, y must be ≥ s ≥ 1400
   - However, the conditions require y to be in the intersection interval and satisfy the square difference conditions, which 1444 doesn't satisfy for any valid d and s pair

The proposed answer 1444 doesn't satisfy all the required conditions, while 1469 does. They are not equivalent.
