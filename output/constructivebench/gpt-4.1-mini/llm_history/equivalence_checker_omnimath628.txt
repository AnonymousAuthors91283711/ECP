Ground Truth Answer: 4375
Proposed Answer: 142857
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the count of numbers between 10^6 and 10^9 that are divisible by 7 and are perfect squares.

2. The ground truth answer is 4375.

3. The proposed answer is 142857.

Analysis:
- First, let's find how many numbers between 10^6 and 10^9 are divisible by 7 and perfect squares.
- A number is divisible by 7 and a perfect square if it's divisible by 49 (since 7 is prime).
- So we're looking for numbers of the form (7k)^2 = 49k^2 where 10^6 ≤ 49k^2 ≤ 10^9.
- This gives us 142.857 ≤ k ≤ 4518.9, so k ranges from 143 to 4518.
- The total count would be 4518 - 143 + 1 = 4376, but we need to check the exact bounds:
  - For k=142: 49*142^2 = 987,916 (too small)
  - For k=143: 49*143^2 = 1,002,001 (valid)
  - For k=4518: 49*4518^2 = 999,997,956 (valid)
  - For k=4519: 49*4519^2 = 1,000,947,889 (too big)
- So the exact count is 4518 - 143 + 1 = 4376.

However, the ground truth answer is 4375, which is very close (off by 1). The proposed answer 142857 is actually 10^6/7, which is the count of numbers divisible by 7 in that range, not accounting for the perfect square condition.
