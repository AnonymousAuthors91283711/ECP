Ground Truth Answer: 37
Proposed Answer: 10
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest difference (a - b) where a > b and a*b = 2010.

2. First, let's factorize 2010: 2010 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 67

3. We need to find factor pairs (a,b) where a > b and a*b = 2010, then find the pair with minimal difference.

4. Some factor pairs and their differences:
   - (67,30) → difference 37
   - (134,15) → difference 119
   - (201,10) → difference 191
   - (335,6) → difference 329
   - (402,5) → difference 397
   - (670,3) → difference 667
   - (1005,2) → difference 1003
   - (2010,1) → difference 2009

5. The smallest difference is indeed 37 (from pair 67 and 30).

6. The proposed answer is 10, which doesn't appear in any factor pair difference and is clearly not the minimal difference.
