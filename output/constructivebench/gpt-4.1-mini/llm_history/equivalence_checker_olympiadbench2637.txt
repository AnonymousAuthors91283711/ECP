Ground Truth Answer: 5/2
Proposed Answer: 35/12
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the sum of reciprocals of all positive divisors of 24 (excluding 0).

2. First, let's list all positive divisors of 24:
   The prime factorization of 24 is 2³ × 3¹.
   The number of divisors is (3+1)(1+1) = 8.
   The divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.

3. Now let's calculate the sum of reciprocals:
   1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12 + 1/24
   = (24 + 12 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1)/24
   = 60/24
   = 5/2

4. The ground truth answer is 5/2, which matches our calculation.

5. The proposed answer is 35/12, which does not match our calculation.
