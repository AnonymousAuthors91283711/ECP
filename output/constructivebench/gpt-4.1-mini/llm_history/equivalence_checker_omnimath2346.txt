Ground Truth Answer: 1024 / 255
Proposed Answer: 136 / 255
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about calculating the average size of non-empty subsets of an 8-element set.

2. For an 8-element set:
   - Total number of subsets (including empty): 2^8 = 256
   - Number of non-empty subsets: 256 - 1 = 255 (matches initial_collection.card)
   - Sum of sizes of all subsets: ∑(k=0 to 8) C(8,k)*k = 8*2^7 = 1024
   - Sum of sizes of non-empty subsets: 1024 - 0 = 1024 (since empty set has size 0)

3. Therefore, the average size should be 1024/255.

4. The proposed answer is 136/255, which is incorrect. The numerator should be 1024, not 136.

The ground truth answer is correct, while the proposed answer is wrong.
