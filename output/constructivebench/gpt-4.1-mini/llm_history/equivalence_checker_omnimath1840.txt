Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: ((2 ^ 41).digits 10).toFinset.card
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The problem asks for the count of distinct digits in the base-10 representation of 2^41. The ground truth answer is 13, which means there are 13 distinct digits in this number. The proposed answer calculates this by converting the digits to a Finset (which automatically removes duplicates) and then taking its cardinality. This is exactly equivalent to counting distinct digits, so the answers are equivalent.
