Ground Truth Answer: 320 * π / 180  -- Convert degrees to radians
Proposed Answer: Real.pi / 7 + 2 * Real.pi / 7 + 4 * Real.pi / 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a set of real numbers x in (0, π) that satisfy a trigonometric equation, and their sum.

2. The ground truth answer is 320π/180, which simplifies to 16π/9 (≈ 5.585 radians).

3. The proposed answer is π/7 + 2π/7 + 4π/7 = 7π/7 = π (≈ 3.1416 radians).

4. Clearly, π ≠ 16π/9, as 16/9 ≈ 1.777 while π/π = 1.

5. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth, and there's no obvious transformation that would make them equivalent.
