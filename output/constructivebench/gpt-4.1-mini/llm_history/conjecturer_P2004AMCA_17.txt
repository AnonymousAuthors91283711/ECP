theorem P2004AMCA_17 (f : ℕ → ℕ) (h₁ : f 1 = 1) (h₂ : ∀ n, f (2 * n) = n * f n) :
    f (2^100) = P2004AMCA_17_answer 100 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The condition f(2n) = n * f(n) together with f(1) = 1 implies the function f at powers of 2 can be defined recursively: f(2^k) = 2^(k-1) * f(2^(k-1)). Unfolding this recurrence, the solution is f(2^k) = 2^((k-1) + (k-2) + ... + 0) = 2^{k(k-1)/2}.

Thus, for input n, the answer is 2^{n(n-1)/2}.
