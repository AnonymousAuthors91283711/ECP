Ground Truth Answer: (7, 49)
Proposed Answer: (7, -14)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for real numbers a and b such that:
   - There exists a complex cube root of 343 (which is 7) that is not real (i.e., the complex roots)
   - This complex root satisfies the quadratic equation z² + a*z + b = 0

2. The cube roots of 343 are:
   - 7 (real)
   - -7/2 + (7√3/2)i
   - -7/2 - (7√3/2)i (complex conjugates)

3. For the complex roots, we can plug them into the quadratic:
   z = -7/2 ± (7√3/2)i
   z² = (49/4 - 147/4) ± 2*(-7/2)*(7√3/2)i = (-98/4) ∓ (49√3/2)i = -24.5 ∓ 24.5√3 i

4. The quadratic equation becomes:
   z² + a*z + b = (-24.5 ∓ 24.5√3 i) + a*(-3.5 ± 3.5√3 i) + b = 0

5. Separating real and imaginary parts:
   Real: -24.5 - 3.5a + b = 0
   Imaginary: ∓24.5√3 ± 3.5a√3 = 0 ⇒ a = 7

6. Substituting a=7 into the real part:
   -24.5 - 24.5 + b = 0 ⇒ b = 49

The ground truth answer (7, 49) is correct, while the proposed answer (7, -14) is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the equations derived from the complex roots.
