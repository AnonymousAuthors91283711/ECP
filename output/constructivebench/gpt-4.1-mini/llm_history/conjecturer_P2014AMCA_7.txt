abbrev P2014AMCA_7_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2014AMCA_7 : 
  ∃ (r : ℝ), (√3) * r = 3^(1/3) ∧ (3^(1/3)) * r = 3^(1/6) ∧ (3^(1/6)) * r = P2014AMCA_7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<(3: ℝ)^(1/6)>>>
Explanation: From the chain of equations, multiplying by r progressively scales by roots of 3, the last product is the 6th root of 3.
