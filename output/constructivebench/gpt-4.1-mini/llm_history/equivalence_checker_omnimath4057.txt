Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => 
    if a = b ∧ a % 2 = 0 then 2 * (a / 2) + 3
    else max a b + 2
Proposed Answer: fun a b => a + b + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest number m such that any set of m integers between -a and b (inclusive) must contain three distinct elements that sum to zero.

2. The ground truth answer handles two cases:
   - When a = b and both are even: returns 2*(a/2) + 3
   - Otherwise: returns max(a,b) + 2

3. The proposed answer simply returns a + b + 1 for all cases.

Let's test some examples:
- Case 1: a = 2, b = 2 (both equal and even)
  - Ground truth: 2*(2/2) + 3 = 5
  - Proposed: 2 + 2 + 1 = 5
  - Match

- Case 2: a = 3, b = 3 (equal but odd)
  - Ground truth: max(3,3) + 2 = 5
  - Proposed: 3 + 3 + 1 = 7
  - Don't match

- Case 3: a = 2, b = 4 (unequal)
  - Ground truth: max(2,4) + 2 = 6
  - Proposed: 2 + 4 + 1 = 7
  - Don't match

The proposed answer only matches the ground truth in the specific case where a = b and both are even. In all other cases, it gives a different (and incorrect) result. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
