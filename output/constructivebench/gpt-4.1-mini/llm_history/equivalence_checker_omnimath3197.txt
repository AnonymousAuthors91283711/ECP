theorem omnimath3197 (x : ℕ) (hx : 0 < x) (h : 100 % x = 10) : 
  1000 % x = omnimath3197_answer x := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => if 100 % x = 10 then 1000 % x else 0
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℕ => if 0 < x ∧ 100 % x = 10 then 1000 % x else 0
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but adds an additional constraint `0 < x` that is already implied by the problem statement (through `hx : 0 < x`). The ground truth answer correctly captures the essence of the problem without restating this precondition. While functionally equivalent when used as specified in the theorem, the proposed answer is slightly less general.
