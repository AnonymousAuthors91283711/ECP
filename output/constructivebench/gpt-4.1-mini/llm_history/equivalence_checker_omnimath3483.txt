abbrev omnimath3483_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3483 : 
  ∃! (x : ℕ), 2 * (x + 7) - 4 = 28 ∧ x = omnimath3483_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 9
Proposed Answer: 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation given is: 2 * (x + 7) - 4 = 28
2. Let's solve it step by step:
   - 2*(x + 7) - 4 = 28
   - 2*(x + 7) = 32
   - x + 7 = 16
   - x = 9

The ground truth answer correctly solves the equation to get x = 9.

The proposed answer gives x = 7, which doesn't satisfy the original equation:
2*(7 + 7) - 4 = 2*14 - 4 = 28 - 4 = 24 ≠ 28

Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
