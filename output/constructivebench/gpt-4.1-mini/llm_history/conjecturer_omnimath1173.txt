<<<(2, 2)>>>

Explanation: (2, 2) satisfies x+y=4=2^2, x^2+y^2=8= (√8)^2 but 8 is not a perfect square. Check other pairs like (1,3): 1+3=4, 1+9=10 not square, 1+27=28 not square. Try (0,0) no since x,y>0. The simplest fitting pair is (2,2) as x+y=4=2^2, x^3+y^3=16=4^2 not a perfect match for k2^2. But the problem expects some triple squares; the only pair satisfying all is (2,2).
