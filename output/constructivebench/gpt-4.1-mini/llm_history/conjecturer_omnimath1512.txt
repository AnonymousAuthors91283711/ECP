The problem requires a specific natural number, not a function of A, as the answer omnimath1512_answer : ℕ. From the constraints and example, the sum B + C + D that satisfies the given conditions is constant (9) across all relevant A values according to enumeration hints.

You tried to assign a function expression but the type is ℕ, not ℕ → ℕ, which caused errors. The correct fix is to assign the natural number 9 directly as the constant answer.

Therefore, the final corrected answer is just:

<<<9>>>
