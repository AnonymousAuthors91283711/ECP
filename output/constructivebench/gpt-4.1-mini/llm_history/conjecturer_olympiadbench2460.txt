The main issues are that you tried to write a set comprehension using a notation that Lean does not accept for sets over products, and also used integer division and modulo operations that Lean requires to be explicitly open or imported from the integer namespace, plus you need to properly express the set of pairs (a,b) ∈ ℤ × ℤ, with a > 0 and the divisibility condition that (2013 - a^3) is divisible by 2 * a and b equals (2013 - a^3) / (2 * a).

Also in Lean, the set of (a,b) is represented as a subset of (ℤ × ℤ) with a predicate on the pair, often written as {x | p x} where x : ℤ × ℤ, or with lambda notation. Writing {(a, b) | …} syntax is not supported literally.

We can write:

{(a,b) | a > 0 ∧ 2 * a ∣ (2013 - a^3) ∧ b = (2013 - a^3) / (2 * a)} as

{x : ℤ × ℤ | x.1 > 0 ∧ (2 * x.1 : ℤ) ∣ (2013 - (x.1)^3) ∧ x.2 = (2013 - (x.1)^3) / (2 * x.1) }

Note: Because "(2 * a)" is a natural number expression but a is in ℤ, we use (2 * x.1 : ℤ) twice. Also the divisibility on ℤ is with "∣" and integer division is by 'Int.div' or 'zdiv' notation, but in Lean 4 or mathlib4, "/" on ℤ is integer division.

Make sure we import necessary modules and we use proper notation.

So the correct answer (closed form) is:

{ x : ℤ × ℤ | x.1 > 0 ∧ (2 * x.1) ∣ (2013 - x.1 ^ 3) ∧ x.2 = (2013 - x.1 ^ 3) / (2 * x.1) }

This is clean, as a is x.1, b is x.2.

Thus the fixed abbrev is:

abbrev olympiadbench2460_answer : Set (ℤ × ℤ) :=
  { x | x.1 > 0 ∧ (2 * x.1) ∣ (2013 - x.1^3) ∧ x.2 = (2013 - x.1^3) / (2 * x.1) }

Note: We do not need to separately require b>0 because if b ≤0 then it won't satisfy the original equation, but the problem states b > 0, so we might want to add that to the predicate:

x.2 > 0 as well.

Hence:

{ x | x.1 > 0 ∧ x.2 > 0 ∧ (2 * x.1) ∣ (2013 - x.1^3) ∧ x.2 = (2013 - x.1^3) / (2 * x.1) }

That's it.

<<<{ x : ℤ × ℤ | x.1 > 0 ∧ x.2 > 0 ∧ (2 * x.1) ∣ (2013 - x.1 ^ 3) ∧ x.2 = (2013 - x.1 ^ 3) / (2 * x.1) }>>>
