Ground Truth Answer: fun ⟨x, y⟩ => 15 - y / x
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℝ × ℝ => 2 * p.1 + 0.5 * p.2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function z = f(x,y) where x ∈ [2,5] and y ∈ [10,20], and claims the maximum value of z is 13.

2. Ground Truth Answer: z = 15 - y/x
   - For x=2, y=20: z = 15 - 20/2 = 5
   - For x=5, y=10: z = 15 - 10/5 = 13
   - The maximum occurs at (5,10) giving z=13, which matches the theorem.

3. Proposed Answer: z = 2x + 0.5y
   - For x=2, y=20: z = 4 + 10 = 14
   - For x=5, y=10: z = 10 + 5 = 15
   - The maximum would be 15 (at (5,10)), not 13 as required.

The proposed answer gives different values and a different maximum than the ground truth, so they are not equivalent.
