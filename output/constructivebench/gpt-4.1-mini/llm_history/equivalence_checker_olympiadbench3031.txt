Ground Truth Answer: 210
Proposed Answer: (20 * 2^19)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the exponent K in the prime factorization of the product of all divisors of n=2^20.

2. The product of all divisors of a number n with d divisors is known to be n^(d/2).

3. For n=2^20, the number of divisors d is 20+1=21 (since divisors are 2^0, 2^1,...,2^20).

4. Therefore, the product is (2^20)^(21/2) = 2^(20*21/2) = 2^210.

5. Thus, K should be 210.

The ground truth answer is 210, which is correct.

The proposed answer is (20 * 2^19), which evaluates to 20*524288=10485760, which is not equal to 210.
