Ground Truth Answer: 60
Proposed Answer: 50
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation given is:
   (10*(1 + n/100)*75*(1 - n/100)) * (15*(1 + n/100)*75*(1 - n/100)) = 345600

2. We can simplify this:
   - Notice that (1 + n/100)*(1 - n/100) = (1 - (n/100)^2)
   - The equation becomes: 10*15*75*75*(1 - (n/100)^2)^2 = 345600
   - Calculate the constants: 10*15*75*75 = 843750
   - So: 843750*(1 - (n/100)^2)^2 = 345600

3. Solving for n:
   (1 - (n/100)^2)^2 = 345600/843750 ≈ 0.4096
   Take square root: 1 - (n/100)^2 ≈ ±0.64
   We take the positive root (since n is between 0 and 100):
   1 - (n/100)^2 = 0.64
   (n/100)^2 = 0.36
   n/100 = 0.6
   n = 60

The ground truth answer is 60, while the proposed answer is 50. These are clearly different values.
