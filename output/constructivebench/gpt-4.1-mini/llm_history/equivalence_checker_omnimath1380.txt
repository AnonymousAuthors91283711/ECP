Ground Truth Answer: 108
Proposed Answer: 12
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. We have two equations:
   - e/f = 3/4 (h1)
   - √(e² + f²) = 15 (h2)

2. From h1, we can express e in terms of f: e = (3/4)f

3. Substitute into h2:
   √((9/16)f² + f²) = 15
   √((25/16)f²) = 15
   (5/4)|f| = 15
   |f| = 12
   f = 12 or f = -12

4. Then e = (3/4)*12 = 9 or e = (3/4)*(-12) = -9

5. Calculate e*f:
   - For positive case: 9*12 = 108
   - For negative case: (-9)*(-12) = 108

The ground truth answer is 108, which is correct. The proposed answer is 12, which is incorrect as it's just the value of f, not the product e*f.
