abbrev omnimath273_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath273 (a : ℕ → ℕ) (n : ℕ) (hn : n = 2017) 
  (h : ∀ m, 1 ≤ m → m ≤ n → 3 * (∑ i in Finset.range m, a i)^2 = ∑ i in Finset.range m, (a i)^3) :
  a 1337 = omnimath273_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<671>>>
Explanation: The problem's condition leads to a unique sequence solution with a(1337) = 671, inferred from pattern analysis of the provided sums and cube relations.
