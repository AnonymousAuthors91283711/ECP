Ground Truth Answer: fun n t => (n + t - 1) / t
Proposed Answer: fun n t => n * t
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of teams (k) where we can select one distinct color from each team, given:
   - n total colors
   - each team has at most t colors
   - teams may share colors

2. The ground truth answer (n + t - 1)/t suggests a "pigeonhole principle" approach where we divide n colors into groups of size t.

3. The proposed answer n*t would imply we can have n*t distinct teams, which doesn't make sense because:
   - It grows with t, when actually larger t means more color overlap between teams
   - It exceeds n when t>1, but we only have n distinct colors to choose from
   - It violates the problem's constraints when t>1 (we can't have more than n teams with distinct colors)

The proposed answer is completely incorrect as it gives a much larger number than possible and doesn't satisfy the problem's conditions.
