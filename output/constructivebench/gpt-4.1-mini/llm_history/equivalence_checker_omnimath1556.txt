Ground Truth Answer: 8/9
Proposed Answer: -1/2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a polynomial P with roots at 1/4, 1/2, 2, and 4, with specific conditions on its evaluations at 0 and 1, and a condition on the product of roots and leading coefficient.

2. The ground truth answer is 8/9 for P(0).

3. The proposed answer is -1/2 for P(0).

To check equivalence:

- The polynomial can be constructed as P(x) = a(x-1/4)(x-1/2)(x-2)(x-4)
- From the condition P(1)=1, we can solve for 'a'
- Then evaluate P(0) using this 'a'
- The correct calculation leads to 8/9, not -1/2

The proposed answer is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
