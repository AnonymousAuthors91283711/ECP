abbrev omnimath3392_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3392 :
  (1 - 1 / 3) * (1 - 1 / 4) * (1 - 1 / 5) = omnimath3392_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2 / 5
Proposed Answer: 4/15
Let's evaluate the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to compute the product (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/4) * (1 - 1/5)
2. Let's calculate step by step:
   - (1 - 1/3) = 2/3
   - (1 - 1/4) = 3/4
   - (1 - 1/5) = 4/5
3. Now multiply them together: (2/3)*(3/4)*(4/5)
4. The 3's cancel out: (2/1)*(1/4)*(4/5)
5. The 4's cancel out: (2/1)*(1/1)*(1/5) = 2/5

The ground truth answer is 2/5, while the proposed answer is 4/15. These are not equivalent fractions (2/5 = 6/15 ≠ 4/15).
