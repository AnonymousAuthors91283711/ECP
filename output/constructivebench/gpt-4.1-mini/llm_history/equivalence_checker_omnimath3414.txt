abbrev omnimath3414_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3414 : 
  ¬ ∃ (k : ℕ), (23 - omnimath3414_answer) = 3 * k ∧ omnimath3414_answer < 23 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 9
Proposed Answer: 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find a natural number x (omnimath3414_answer) such that:
   - (23 - x) is divisible by 3 (i.e., 23 - x = 3k for some k ∈ ℕ)
   - x < 23
   - And then to prove that no such k exists for this x

2. For the ground truth answer (9):
   - 23 - 9 = 14, which is not divisible by 3 (14/3 ≈ 4.666...)
   - This satisfies the theorem since no k exists where 14 = 3k

3. For the proposed answer (7):
   - 23 - 7 = 16, which is also not divisible by 3 (16/3 ≈ 5.333...)
   - This also satisfies the theorem since no k exists where 16 = 3k

Both answers satisfy the conditions of the theorem, as neither 14 nor 16 are divisible by 3. While 9 might be the intended answer, 7 is equally valid mathematically.
