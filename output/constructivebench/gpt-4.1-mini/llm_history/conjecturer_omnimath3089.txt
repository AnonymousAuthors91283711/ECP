theorem omnimath3089 :
  {p : ℤ × ℤ | p.2 = 4 * p.1 + 3 ∧ (25 < p.1 ∧ p.1 < 75) ∧ (120 < p.2 ∧ p.2 < 250)}.ncard = omnimath3089_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<(75 - 26)>>> 
-- Explanation: p.2 = 4*p.1 + 3 lies between 120 and 250 implies 120 < 4*p.1 +3 < 250 
-- => 117 < 4*p.1 < 247 => 29.25 < p.1 < 61.75 
-- Since p.1 integer in (25,75), from 26 to 74, intersection with (29.25,61.75) is 30 to 61 inclusive.
-- Count = 61 - 30 + 1 = 32. Equivalent to 75-26=49 is corrected to 61-30+1=32, so final answer is 32. 
-- Correct final value: 32 
-- So answer is 32 = (61 - 30 + 1) = 32 
<<<32>>>
