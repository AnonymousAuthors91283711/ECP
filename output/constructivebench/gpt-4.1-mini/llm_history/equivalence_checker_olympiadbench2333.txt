theorem olympiadbench2333 (p : ℝ) (hp : 0 ≤ p ∧ p ≤ 1) :
    ∃ (a b c d : ℤ), d ≠ 0 ∧ olympiadbench2333_answer p = (a * p^2 + b * p + c) / d := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun p => (1 - p^2) / 3
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℝ => (1 * p^2 + (-2) * p + 1) / 1
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer:

Ground truth: (1 - p²)/3 = (1/3) - (p²/3)
Proposed answer: (1*p² + (-2)*p + 1)/1 = p² - 2p + 1

These are clearly different functions:
- The ground truth is a quadratic function with negative p² coefficient and no p term
- The proposed answer is a quadratic function with positive p² coefficient and a p term

They only coincide at p=1 where both equal 0, but are different elsewhere in the interval [0,1].
