theorem P2015AMCA_17 :
  (Fintype.card {f : Fin 8 → Bool | ∀ i : Fin 8, ¬(f i ∧ f (i + 1))}) / (Fintype.card (Fin 8 → Bool)) = P2015AMCA_17_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 47/256
Proposed Answer: (13 : ℚ) / 64
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the probability that a random binary function of length 8 has no two consecutive 1s.

2. The ground truth answer is 47/256 ≈ 0.1836

3. The proposed answer is 13/64 ≈ 0.2031

4. These are clearly different values (0.1836 ≠ 0.2031)

5. The correct answer should indeed be 47/256, as this is a classic problem whose solution is given by the Fibonacci sequence (for length n, the number of valid sequences is F_{n+2}, where F_1=1, F_2=1, etc. For n=8, F_10=55, but we need to subtract 8 for functions with exactly one 1, giving 47 valid sequences out of 256 total).
