theorem P2019AIMEII_9 :
  let S := ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2018, if (divisors n).card = 20 ∧ 20 ∣ n then n else 0

Ground Truth Answer: 472
Proposed Answer: (2^7 * 3^2 * 5)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the sum S of all numbers n between 1 and 2018 where:
   - n has exactly 20 divisors
   - n is divisible by 20
   Then we need to divide this sum by 20 and find the result.

2. The ground truth answer is 472.

3. The proposed answer is (2^7 * 3^2 * 5). Let's compute this:
   2^7 * 3^2 * 5 = 128 * 9 * 5 = 128 * 45 = 5760

4. 5760 ≠ 472, so the answers are not equivalent.

5. Moreover, the proposed answer is in factored form but evaluates to a completely different number than the correct answer.
