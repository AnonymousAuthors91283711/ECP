Ground Truth Answer: 62
Proposed Answer: 702 + 310 + 6 + 4
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem is about finding numbers m, n, r, s that satisfy certain congruence conditions and then summing them.

2. The ground truth answer is 62.

3. The proposed answer is 702 + 310 + 6 + 4 = 1022.

Analysis:
- The proposed answer (1022) is vastly different from the ground truth (62)
- The numbers 702, 310, 6, 4 don't appear to satisfy the given congruence conditions
- The sum is clearly incorrect as it's much larger than the correct answer

The proposed answer is completely wrong and doesn't satisfy any of the problem's conditions.

<<<False>>>
