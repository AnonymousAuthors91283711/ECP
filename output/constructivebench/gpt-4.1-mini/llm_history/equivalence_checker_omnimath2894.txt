theorem omnimath2894 : 
  ∀ (x : ℝ), (y = 1 ∧ 4 * x - 2 * y + 3 = 3 * x + 3 * y) ↔ x = omnimath2894_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us an equation system:
   - y = 1
   - 4x - 2y + 3 = 3x + 3y

2. We can substitute y = 1 into the second equation:
   4x - 2(1) + 3 = 3x + 3(1)
   => 4x - 2 + 3 = 3x + 3
   => 4x + 1 = 3x + 3
   => x = 2

3. The ground truth answer is indeed x = 2, which matches our calculation.

4. The proposed answer is x = 0, which doesn't satisfy the equation when we substitute back:
   For x = 0, y = 1:
   Left side: 4(0) - 2(1) + 3 = 1
   Right side: 3(0) + 3(1) = 3
   1 ≠ 3, so x = 0 is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
