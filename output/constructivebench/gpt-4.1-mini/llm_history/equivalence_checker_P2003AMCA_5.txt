Ground Truth Answer: 14
Proposed Answer: (17 : ℕ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find digits A, M, C (each between 0-9) such that:
   - (AMC10 + AMC12) = 123422
   - A + M + C equals some answer

2. Let's break down the equation:
   AMC10 + AMC12 = 2*AMC + 22 = 123422
   Therefore: 2*AMC = 123400 → AMC = 61700

3. But AMC is a 3-digit number (from the coefficients: 100*A + 10*M + C), but 61700 is a 5-digit number. This is impossible.

4. The ground truth answer is 14, but the proposed answer is 17. However, the problem itself seems to have no solution since we can't have a 3-digit AMC equal to 61700.

5. Both answers are incorrect because the problem has no valid solution, but they are different incorrect answers.
