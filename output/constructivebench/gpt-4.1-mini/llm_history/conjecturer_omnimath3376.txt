<<<33>>> 
Explanation: The given proportions for eggshell, cream, and cornsilk eyes sum to 3/10 + 4/10 + 5/10 = 1. Each count corresponds to the occurrence of that value in either coordinate (first or second). The problem asks for the proportion of students with both coordinates equal. This turns out to be the sum of the proportions for each pair of identical coordinates, which matches 1/3 (or 33%) given the distribution. Thus, the answer is 33 as a percentage.
