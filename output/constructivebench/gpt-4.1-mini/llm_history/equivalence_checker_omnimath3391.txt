abbrev omnimath3391_answer : â„• := sorry
theorem omnimath3391 : 9^4 = omnimath3391_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 3^8
Proposed Answer: 6561
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer "6561" is equivalent to the ground truth answer "3^8" because:
1. 3^8 = (3^2)^4 = 9^4 (which matches the problem statement)
2. 9^4 = 6561
Both expressions evaluate to the same numerical value, just represented differently (exponential form vs. expanded form).
