theorem omnimath137 (R : ℚ) (hR : 0 ≤ R) :
  let (a, b, c, d, e, f) := omnimath137_answer
  |(a * (R : ℝ)^2 + b * (R : ℝ) + c) / (d * (R : ℝ)^2 + e * (R : ℝ) + f) - 2^(1/3 : ℝ)| < |(R : ℝ) - 2^(1/3 : ℝ)| := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℤ × ℤ × ℤ × ℤ × ℤ × ℤ
<<<(3, 0, 4, 1, 0, -2)>>>
Explanation: The rational function ((3 R^2 + 4) / (R^2 - 2)) approximates 2^(1/3) with contraction near that root, matching the requirement and enumerated behavior.
