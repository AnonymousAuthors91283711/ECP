Ground Truth Answer: fun n => ⌈(n : ℝ) / 2⌉.toNat + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n => (n + 1) / 2
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer `fun n => (n + 1) / 2` is close to the ground truth `fun n => ⌈(n : ℝ) / 2⌉.toNat + 1` but not exactly equivalent. For even values of n, both expressions yield the same result (e.g., n=2 gives 2 in both cases). However, for odd values of n, the proposed answer gives a value one less than the ground truth (e.g., n=3 gives 2 vs 3). The ground truth correctly accounts for the ceiling operation and adds 1, while the proposed answer performs simple integer division.
