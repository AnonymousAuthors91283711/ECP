theorem P2004AMCB_3 (x y : ℕ) (hx : 0 < x) (hy : 0 < y) :
    2^x * 3^y = 1296 ↔ x + y = P2004AMCB_3_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation given is 2^x * 3^y = 1296
2. First, we factorize 1296: 1296 = 2^4 * 3^4 (since 1296 = 6^4 = (2*3)^4 = 2^4 * 3^4)
3. Therefore, the only solution in natural numbers is x=4 and y=4
4. Thus x + y = 8

The ground truth answer is correct (8), while the proposed answer (4) is incorrect as it only accounts for either x or y but not their sum.
