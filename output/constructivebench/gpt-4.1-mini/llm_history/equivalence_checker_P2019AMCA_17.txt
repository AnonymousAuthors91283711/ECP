Ground Truth Answer: 10
Proposed Answer: 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding a recurrence relation for the sum of powers of roots of the polynomial x³ - 5x² + 8x - 13.

2. For any monic polynomial, the coefficients give the elementary symmetric polynomials of the roots, and the sums of powers of roots satisfy a recurrence relation determined by the polynomial's coefficients.

3. For a cubic polynomial x³ - a x² + b x - c, the recurrence relation for the sum of powers s(n) is:
   s(n+1) = a*s(n) - b*s(n-1) + c*s(n-2)

4. In our case, the polynomial is x³ - 5x² + 8x - 13, so the recurrence is:
   s(n+1) = 5s(n) - 8s(n-1) + 13s(n-2)

5. Therefore, a = 5, b = -8, c = 13, and a + b + c = 5 - 8 + 13 = 10

The ground truth answer (10) is correct, while the proposed answer (3) is incorrect.
