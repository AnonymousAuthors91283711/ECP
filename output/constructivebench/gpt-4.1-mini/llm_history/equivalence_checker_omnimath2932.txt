(S B : ℕ)
(hratio : S * 4 = B * 7)
(hmore : S = B + 12)
: S + B = omnimath2932_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 44
Proposed Answer: 84
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have two equations:
   - S * 4 = B * 7 (from hratio)
   - S = B + 12 (from hmore)

2. Substitute the second equation into the first:
   (B + 12)*4 = B*7
   => 4B + 48 = 7B
   => 48 = 3B
   => B = 16

3. Then S = B + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28

4. Therefore S + B = 28 + 16 = 44

The ground truth answer (44) is correct, while the proposed answer (84) is incorrect. The calculations clearly show the correct sum should be 44, not 84.
