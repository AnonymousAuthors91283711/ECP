Ground Truth Answer: 59
Proposed Answer: 26 + 10
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number k that can be expressed as k = m + n where m and n are coprime integers, and the ratio m/n equals a specific rational expression involving 26 and 10.

2. The ground truth answer is 59, which comes from:
   - Simplifying the given rational expression to 1/10 + 1/26 = 36/260 = 9/65
   - Finding coprime m and n such that m/n = 9/65 (which are indeed coprime)
   - Then m + n = 9 + 65 = 74
   - But we can reduce this further by simplifying 36/260 to 9/65 (lowest terms)
   - The minimal sum comes from the minimal pair (9,65) giving 74, but actually the problem might have a different interpretation

Wait, there seems to be some confusion here. The ground truth answer is 59, but the proposed answer is 26 + 10 = 36. 

The proposed answer is simply adding the two numbers from the problem (26 and 10) without considering the actual rational expression or the coprime condition. This is clearly incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the problem's conditions.
