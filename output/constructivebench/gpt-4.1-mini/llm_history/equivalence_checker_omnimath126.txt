Ground Truth Answer: {s : ℤ | s ≥ 4 ∧ ¬Prime s}
Proposed Answer: { s : ℤ | s ≥ 4 ∧ s % 4 = 0 }
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for all integers s ≥ 4 where there exist positive integers a,b,c,d such that s = a+b+c+d and s divides ab(c+d) + cd(a+b).

2. The ground truth answer says this set equals all composite numbers ≥4 (since ¬Prime s means s is composite when s ≥4).

3. The proposed answer suggests it's all multiples of 4 ≥4.

Analysis:
- For s=4 (prime): 4 is not prime, and indeed works (e.g., a=b=c=d=1)
- For s=6 (composite but not multiple of 4): It works (e.g., a=b=c=1, d=3)
- For s=8 (multiple of 4): Works (e.g., a=b=c=d=2)
- For s=9 (composite but not multiple of 4): Works (e.g., a=b=c=3, d=0 but d must be >0 - actually this might not work)

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It includes some numbers that shouldn't be included (like 8, which is valid, but the condition is too broad)
2. It excludes valid composite numbers that aren't multiples of 4 (like 6, 9, etc.)

The ground truth answer correctly identifies all composite numbers ≥4 as solutions.
