theorem omnimath2272 : 
  card {d : Fin 4 → Fin 6 | ∃ (x : Fin 6), 3 ≤ card (univ.filter (fun i => d i = x))} * (1 : ℚ) / (6^4) 
  = omnimath2272_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<< 1 / 6 >>> 
The expected value is the probability that there exists a value in the codomain of size 6 with at least 3 preimages under a function from a 4-element domain, which is \(\frac{1}{6}\).
