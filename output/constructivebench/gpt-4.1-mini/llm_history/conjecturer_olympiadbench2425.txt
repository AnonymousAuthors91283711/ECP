The problem is that the proposed answer is trying to define a Set ℝ, but equivalently the definition is an equality proposition rather than the set itself. The solution is to directly define the set of values s satisfying the condition, i.e. a set of two explicit elements, without using equality. The set equals { (√2 - 1)/√2, - (√2 - 1)/√2 } and that is the closed form description of the values of s.

Here is the fixed Lean expression:

<<<{(real.sqrt 2 - 1) / real.sqrt 2, -((real.sqrt 2 - 1) / real.sqrt 2)}>>> 

Explanation:
- The original code defined olympiadbench2425_answer as a Set ℝ, so define it directly as the set with two elements.
- We write √2 as real.sqrt 2.
- The two values are ± (√2 - 1) / √2. 
- This fixes the type mismatch: we provide a set as expected rather than a proposition (an equality of sets).

This is the expected closed form set of all s such that cos θ = tan θ and s = sin θ.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error arises because Lean's mathlib uses `Real.sqrt` rather than `real.sqrt` or any lowercase version. Additionally, sets in Lean are defined using set notation with `∈` (e.g., `Set ℝ := {x | ...}`) or explicit finite sets using `Finset` or `Set` notation like `{a, b}`. Here, `Set ℝ := {a, b}` is acceptable if we import set notation and use proper syntax.

Since the problem asks for all real numbers \( s \) such that there exists a real \(\theta\) with \(\cos \theta = \tan \theta\) and \(\sin \theta = s\), we find this leads to the two solution values:

\[
s = \pm \frac{\sqrt{2} - 1}{\sqrt{2}} = \pm (1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})
\]

We can therefore state:

```lean
{(Real.sqrt 2 - 1) / Real.sqrt 2, -((Real.sqrt 2 - 1) / Real.sqrt 2)}
```

which fixes the `real.sqrt` to `Real.sqrt`. Then wrap this in a set.

The final corrected answer expression is:

<<<{(Real.sqrt 2 - 1) / Real.sqrt 2, -((Real.sqrt 2 - 1) / Real.sqrt 2)}>>>
