The error arises because `T` is used in the global abbreviation without being defined or passed as a parameter. To fix this, we generalize the answer as a function of `T : ℝ` (or more generally `T > 1` for convergence concerns). Given the problem involves the sum ∑ (cos θ')^n and sin θ' = sqrt(T² -64)/T, we find cos² θ' = 1 - sin² θ' = 1 - (T² -64)/T² = 64/T², so cos θ' = 8 / T or -8 / T.

Assuming the sum ∑ (cos θ')^n is a geometric series with ratio r = cos θ' and |r| < 1, the sum is 1/(1 - r). Since T=32, cos θ' = 8/32=1/4, so sum = 1/(1 - 1/4) = 1/(3/4) = 4/3. Plugging T, we get sum = 1 / (1 - 8 / T) = T / (T - 8).

Hence the answer is: olympiadbench2836_answer T := T / (T - 8).

This expression no longer refers to `T` undefined globally, but as a function of T.

The error arises because `olympiadbench2836_answer` is declared as a plain real number `ℝ`, but the candidate value is a function `ℝ → ℝ`. The correct approach is to provide a closed-form numeric expression depending on the parameter `T`, which is fixed as 32 in the theorem.

Given the theorem setting `T = 32` and the condition on `sin θ = sqrt(T^2 - 64)/T`, note:

- The summation is over an infinite series ∑ (cos θ)^n with n from 0 to ∞, which converges to 1/(1 - cos θ) if |cos θ| < 1.

- Using the Pythagorean identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1, and given sin θ = sqrt(T² - 64)/T, we find:

  cos θ = 8 / T

- Therefore, the infinite sum is 1 / (1 - 8 / T) = T / (T - 8)

Given T = 32, the sum evaluates to 32 / (32 - 8) = 32 / 24 = 4/3

Hence, the answer is the real number 4/3 (this is a constant value, not a function depending on T, since T is fixed to 32 by hypothesis).

Thus, the correct fixed answer is the real number 4/3.
