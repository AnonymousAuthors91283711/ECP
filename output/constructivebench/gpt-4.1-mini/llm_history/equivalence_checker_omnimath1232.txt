Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 14
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the largest natural number d that divides (2002^n + 2) for all n ≥ 1.

2. First, let's test n=1: 2002^1 + 2 = 2004
   Factors of 2004: 2 × 2 × 3 × 167
   GCD of 2004 and 6 is 6
   GCD of 2004 and 14 is 2 (since 14=2×7, but 2004 has no factor of 7)

3. For n=2: 2002^2 + 2 = 4008004 + 2 = 4008006
   GCD of 4008006 and 6 is 6
   GCD of 4008006 and 14 is 2 (since 4008006 is divisible by 2 but not by 7)

4. The ground truth answer 6 works for all n ≥ 1, while the proposed answer 14 fails to divide (2002^n + 2) consistently for all n.

5. The condition requires that d must divide (2002^n + 2) for ALL n ≥ 1, and 14 fails this condition.
