Ground Truth Answer: 10
Proposed Answer: 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have two variables: pencilCost and eraserCost, with pencilCost > eraserCost
2. The equation given is: 13*pencilCost + 3*eraserCost = 100
3. We need to find pencilCost + eraserCost

Let's solve the equation:
13p + 3e = 100
We can rearrange to express e in terms of p:
3e = 100 - 13p
e = (100 - 13p)/3

Since e must be a natural number, (100 - 13p) must be divisible by 3.

Testing possible values for p (remembering p > e):
- p=4: e=(100-52)/3=16 → p+e=20 (but 4>16 is false)
- p=5: e=(100-65)/3≈11.66 → not integer
- p=6: e=(100-78)/3≈7.33 → not integer
- p=7: e=(100-91)/3=3 → p+e=10 (and 7>3 is true)

The next possible p would be p=10: e=(100-130)/3=-10 → negative, invalid

The only valid solution is p=7, e=3 → sum is 10.

The ground truth answer is 10, while the proposed answer is 7 (which is just the pencil cost, not the sum).
