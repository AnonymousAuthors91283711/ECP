  let a := 1
  let b := -3 * k
  let c := -4 * k^2
  let discriminant := b^2 - 4 * a * c
  let P := (-b - Real.sqrt discriminant) / (2 * a)

Ground Truth Answer: fun k => 3 * k
Proposed Answer: fun k : ℝ => 6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find a function omnimath2758_answer(k) such that when the calculated area equals 80, the function evaluates to 6.

2. The ground truth answer is a function that returns 3*k for any input k.

3. The proposed answer is a constant function that always returns 6, regardless of k.

The two answers are only equal when k=2 (since 3*2=6), but not for other values of k. Therefore, the proposed answer is not equivalent to the ground truth answer.

The problem specifies that when area=80, the function should return 6. The ground truth answer satisfies this (since when area=80, k=2, and 3*2=6), but also defines the function for all other k values. The proposed answer fails to match the ground truth for k≠2.
