Ground Truth Answer: {(9, 3), (6, 3), (9, 5), (54, 5)}
Proposed Answer: {(m, n) | m = 3^n ∧ n = 0} ∪ {(m, n) | m = 2^(n+1) - 1 ∧ n ≥ 1}
Let me analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

1. The ground truth explicitly lists four specific solutions: (9,3), (6,3), (9,5), and (54,5).

2. The proposed answer gives two general forms:
   - m = 3^n when n = 0
   - m = 2^(n+1) - 1 when n ≥ 1

Let's test the ground truth solutions against the proposed forms:

For (9,3):
- 3^3 = 27 ≠ 9
- 2^(3+1)-1 = 15 ≠ 9
- Doesn't match either form

For (6,3):
- 3^3 = 27 ≠ 6
- 2^(3+1)-1 = 15 ≠ 6
- Doesn't match either form

For (9,5):
- 3^5 = 243 ≠ 9
- 2^(5+1)-1 = 63 ≠ 9
- Doesn't match either form

For (54,5):
- 3^5 = 243 ≠ 54
- 2^(5+1)-1 = 63 ≠ 54
- Doesn't match either form

The proposed answer doesn't capture any of the ground truth solutions, and the forms given don't align with the actual solutions.
