The issue is that in the abbreviation `P2020AMCA_3_answer` you are attempting to use variables `p`, `g`, `c`, and `v` which are only locally defined inside the theorem and are not in scope outside it. You must express the answer solely in terms of those constants or parameters, or explicitly provide them.

Given the problem's let-binding: 
- t, v, g, p, c.
- miles = t * v
- gallons = miles / g = (t*v)/g
- pay = miles * p = t*v*p
- expenses = gallons * c = (t*v / g)*c

The expression to find is:
(pay - expenses)/t = (t*v*p - (t*v / g)*c) / t = (t*v*p)/t - (t*v / g)*c / t = v*p - (v/g)*c

So the simplified expression is `v * (p - c / g)`

Since c and g are in denominator, keep parentheses clearly.

Hence, a suitable final closed form in Lean, with `p`, `g`, `c`, `v` replaced by their numeric values or as parameters in a function, is:

```lean
fun (t v g p c : ℝ) => v * (p - c / g)
```

If you want to keep them as constants and assign numeric values matching the problem statement, then you can do:

```lean
2, 60, 30, 0.5, 2 -- matching given values

-- Then final answer is:
60 * (0.5 - 2 / 30)
```

But since the problem wants a closed-form generalized expression, returning `v * (p - c / g)` is mathematically correct and general.

The issue is that you defined P2020AMCA_3_answer with type ℝ but provided a function of 5 real variables ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ instead of a single real number. Since in the theorem you fixed the parameters (t,v,g,p,c) = (2,60,30,0.5,2) and defined the expressions based on those constants, the final answer should be a single real number, not a function.

From the problem statement:
- miles = t * v
- gallons = miles / g
- pay = miles * p
- expenses = gallons * c
- (pay - expenses) / t = P2020AMCA_3_answer

Substitute:
(pay - expenses)/t = (t*v * p - (t*v/g)*c)/t = v * p - v * (c / g) = v * (p - c / g)

Then plug in the constants to get the numeric answer:
v = 60, p = 0.5, c = 2, g = 30

So the value is 60 * (0.5 - 2/30) = 60 * (0.5 - 0.066666...) = 60 * 0.433333... = 26

Thus the answer is 26 (real number).

Therefore the final correct closed form of the answer constant is simply the numeric value 26.
