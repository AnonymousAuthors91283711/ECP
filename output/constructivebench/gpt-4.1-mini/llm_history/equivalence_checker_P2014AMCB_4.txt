abbrev P2014AMCB_4_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2014AMCB_4 (m b : ℚ) (hm : m > 0) (hb : b > 0) :
  (4 * m + 3 * b) * 2 = 2 * m + 16 * b ↔ m = P2014AMCB_4_answer * b := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: 7/5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem gives us an equation to solve for m in terms of b:
   (4m + 3b) * 2 = 2m + 16b

2. Let's simplify the equation:
   8m + 6b = 2m + 16b
   8m - 2m = 16b - 6b
   6m = 10b
   m = (10/6)b
   m = (5/3)b

3. The ground truth answer is 2, which would correspond to m = 2b, but our simplification shows m = (5/3)b.

4. The proposed answer is 7/5, which would correspond to m = (7/5)b, which is different from both our simplification and the ground truth.

5. Clearly, neither the ground truth nor the proposed answer matches our correct simplification of m = (5/3)b.
