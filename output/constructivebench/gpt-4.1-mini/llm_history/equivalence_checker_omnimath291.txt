Ground Truth Answer: 4489
Proposed Answer: 2010
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest positive integer n such that there exists a permutation p of {1,...,n} where for every k, (k+1)*p(k) is a perfect square.

2. The ground truth answer is 4489, which is 67². This makes sense because:
   - We need pairs (k+1, p(k)) where their product is a square
   - The worst case would be when all k+1 are distinct primes, requiring p(k) to be the same prime to make the product square
   - 67 is the smallest prime where 67² ≥ 2010 (since we need to cover all possible k+1 up to n)

3. The proposed answer is 2010, which is simply the coefficient in the problem statement. This doesn't account for the square condition and is too small.

The answers are not equivalent.
