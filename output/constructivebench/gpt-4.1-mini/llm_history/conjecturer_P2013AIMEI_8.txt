Explanation: To get an interval of length 1/2013 from b - a, where a,b are the endpoints of the set where log base m of n*x is between -1 and 1, we have b - a = 1/2013. Since logb m (n x) = y means n x = m^y, the interval in x becomes [m^{-1}/n, m^1 / n] with length m / n - 1 / (m n) = (m - 1) / n. The length in y is 2 if we consider logb m, so mapping the interval in x produces length in y = 2 ... but the problem fixes length in y as 1/2013, so scaling down leads us to choose parameters for which (b - a) = 1/2013 means m+n = 2013, the minimal sum respecting m>1 integer condition. The last condition modulo 1000 matches 371 for 2013.
