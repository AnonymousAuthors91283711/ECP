open Real

abbrev omnimath3412_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3412 (k : ℝ) : 
    (2 * k + 1 = 4 * k - 5) ↔ k = omnimath3412_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: -2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation given is: 2k + 1 = 4k - 5
2. Solving this:
   - Subtract 2k from both sides: 1 = 2k - 5
   - Add 5 to both sides: 6 = 2k
   - Divide by 2: k = 3

The ground truth answer is indeed 3, which is correct. The proposed answer is -2, which is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
