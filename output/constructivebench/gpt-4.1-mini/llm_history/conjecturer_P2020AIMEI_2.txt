The issue arises because the proposed answer uses division on natural numbers resulting in a noncomputable real number in Lean. To fix the error, we should explicitly cast the numerator and denominator to real numbers to produce a computable real value.

Additionally, let's validate the reasoning and propose a closed-form expression for the answer:

Given the problem conditions:

- \( a = \log_8(2x) \)
- \( b = \log_4(x) \)
- \( c = \log_2(x) \)

We have the equation:

\[
\frac{b}{a} = \frac{c}{b} > 0
\]

Express logarithms with base 2:

\[
a = \frac{\log_2(2x)}{\log_2(8)} = \frac{1 + \log_2 x}{3} = \frac{1 + c}{3}
\]
\[
b = \frac{\log_2 x}{2} = \frac{c}{2}
\]

Then:

\[
\frac{b}{a} = \frac{\frac{c}{2}}{\frac{1+c}{3}} = \frac{3c}{2(1+c)} \quad\text{and}\quad \frac{c}{b} = \frac{c}{\frac{c}{2}} = 2 \text{ (if } c \neq 0)
\]

Equating:

\[
\frac{3c}{2(1+c)} = 2 \implies 3c = 4(1+c) \implies 3c = 4 + 4c \implies -c = 4 \implies c = -4
\]

But since \( b / a > 0 \), and \( c = \log_2 x \), \( x = 2^c = 2^{-4} = \frac{1}{16} \), which is positive.

However, for \( m + n = 17 \), and \( x = m / n = 1 / 16 \), \( m = 1 \), \( n = 16 \), which fits.

Thus the unique positive rational \( x \) is \( \frac{1}{16} \).

Therefore, the answer should be \( \frac{1}{16} \).

Now, write this in Lean, casting numerator and denominator explicitly to real:

Let's analyze the problem and the error message:

1. **About the problem:**
   We have a unique real number \( x \) with conditions involving logarithms to bases 8, 4, and 2:
   - \( a = \log_8 (2x) \)
   - \( b = \log_4 x \)
   - \( c = \log_2 x \)
   And the condition:
   \[
   \frac{b}{a} = \frac{c}{b} > 0
   \]
   with \( x = \frac{m}{n} \), where \( m,n \in \mathbb{N} \) are coprime and sum to 17.

2. **About the Lean error:**
   The error occurs because Lean's real number division relies on instance `Real.instDivInvMonoid`, which is not computable, making the definition of the answer `computable` fail without marking it `noncomputable`.

3. **What's needed:**
   To fix the error for defining the answer:
   - Mark the definition as `noncomputable` since it involves division on reals.
   - Alternatively, express the rational number in a way that Lean can accept without being computable. But for rationals as reals expressed by division, the `noncomputable` keyword is accepted in Lean mathlib and recommended.

4. **Further insight on the answer:**
   According to the problem, the sum \( m + n = 17\), with \(x = \frac{m}{n}\) and \(\gcd(m,n)=1\).

   The logarithmic condition reduces (after algebra) to \( x = \frac{1}{16} \):
   - Because \[
     a = \log_8 (2x) = \frac{\ln (2x)}{\ln 8} = \frac{\ln 2 + \ln x}{3 \ln 2}
     \]
     \[
     b = \log_4 x = \frac{\ln x}{2 \ln 2}
     \]
     \[
     c = \log_2 x = \frac{\ln x}{\ln 2}
     \]
   The equality \( \frac{b}{a} = \frac{c}{b} \) leads to an equation involving \(\ln x\), which simplifies to \(x = \frac{1}{16}\).

   - This matches \( m = 1 \), \( n = 16 \), which are coprime and sum to 17.

5. **Final fix:**
   Declare the answer as `noncomputable` so Lean compiles it correctly.

**Hence, the corrected Lean expression is:**

The provided answer tries to define the answer using `noncomputable def` inside an abbrev statement, which is incorrect syntax in Lean. You should either use `abbrev ... :=` for a one-line definition or `noncomputable def ... :=` outside of an abbrev. Since the problem involves rational numbers (m/n with m+n=17), and presumably x = 1/16 fits the conditions (coprime numerator and denominator 1 and 16, sum 1+16=17), we'll provide the finalized definition as an abbrev for the rational x = 1/16.

To represent 1/16 as a real number, we can write `(1 : ℝ) / 16` in Lean. This corrects the syntax errors and matches the problem requirements.
