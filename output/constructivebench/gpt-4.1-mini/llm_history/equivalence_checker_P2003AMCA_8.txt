Ground Truth Answer: 1/2
Proposed Answer: (4 : ℚ) / 12
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the probability that a randomly selected positive divisor of 60 is less than 7.

2. First, we need to find all positive divisors of 60:
   - 60 = 2² × 3 × 5
   - Number of divisors = (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12
   - The divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60

3. Now count the divisors less than 7:
   - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 → 6 divisors

4. Ground truth gives probability 1/2 (which is 6/12 simplified)
   - This is correct

5. Proposed answer gives 4/12
   - This would correspond to counting only 4 divisors less than 7, which is incorrect
   - The numerator should be 6, not 4

The proposed answer is incorrect because it undercounts the favorable outcomes. The correct probability is 6/12 which simplifies to 1/2.
