Ground Truth Answer: 98721
Proposed Answer: 98736
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the largest number between 10,000 and 99,999 that:
   - Has all distinct digits (digits.Nodup)
   - Is divisible by 63 (63 ∣ n)

2. Checking the ground truth answer 98721:
   - Digits: 9,8,7,2,1 - all distinct
   - 98721 ÷ 63 = 1567 exactly (no remainder)

3. Checking the proposed answer 98736:
   - Digits: 9,8,7,3,6 - all distinct
   - 98736 ÷ 63 ≈ 1567.238 (not divisible)

The proposed answer fails the divisibility condition, while the ground truth answer satisfies all conditions.
