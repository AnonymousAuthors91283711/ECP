  (8 : ℚ) / (5 + 7 + 8) = omnimath2997_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2/5
Proposed Answer: 8 / 20
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer simplifies to 2/5 when reduced to lowest terms (dividing numerator and denominator by 4), which matches the ground truth answer. Both expressions represent the same rational number.
