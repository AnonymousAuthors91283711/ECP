Ground Truth Answer: 148
Proposed Answer: 3^3 * Nat.factorial 3 * 2^3
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting the number of valid final boards in a 3x3 tic-tac-toe game where:
   - The board is completely filled (no empty spaces)
   - There's exactly one winner (no ties)
   - The winner is player 2 (assuming players are 0,1,2)

2. The ground truth answer is 148, which is a known correct count for this specific configuration.

3. The proposed answer is 3^3 * Nat.factorial 3 * 2^3 = 27 * 6 * 8 = 1296, which is much larger than 148.

The proposed answer appears to be an overcounting attempt that doesn't properly account for:
- The constraint of having exactly one winner
- The specific winning patterns in tic-tac-toe
- The requirement that player 2 must be the winner

The multiplication approach doesn't correctly model the problem constraints.
