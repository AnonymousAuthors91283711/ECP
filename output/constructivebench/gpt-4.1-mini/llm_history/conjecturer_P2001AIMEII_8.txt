theorem P2001AIMEII_8 :
  IsLeast {x : ℝ | 0 < x ∧ ∃ (f : ℝ → ℝ),
    (∀ x > 0, f (3 * x) = 3 * f x) ∧
    (∀ x ∈ Icc 1 3, f x = 1 - |x - 2|) ∧
    f x = f 2001} P2001AIMEII_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<1>>> 
Explanation: The conditions imply f is constant at f 2001 and on [1,3], f(x) = 1 - |x-2|, which attains minimum 0 at x=1 or x=3, but due to the functional equation scaling by 3 where f(3x)=3f(x) for x>0, only x=1 makes the least value positive and consistent; thus the least positive x is 1.
