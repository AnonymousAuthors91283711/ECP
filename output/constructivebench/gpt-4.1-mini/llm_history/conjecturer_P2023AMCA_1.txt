The error arises because Lean requires noncomputable definitions when defining certain real number operations due to the way `ℝ` is implemented. Division in `ℝ` involves noncomputable parts, so you must mark such definitions as `noncomputable`.

Additionally, 15/10 simplifies to 3/2. The problem states \(18t + 12t = 45\), hence \(30t = 45\), so \(t = \frac{45}{30} = \frac{3}{2}\). Therefore, \(P2023AMCA_1\_answer = \frac{3}{2}\).

To fix the error, mark the definition `noncomputable` and use `3/2` in a way compatible with real numbers.

The problem encodes an equation system with variable t:
0 ≤ t, 18 * t + 12 * t = 45, and the value 18 * t assigned to P2023AMCA_1_answer.

From 18t + 12t = 30t = 45, so t = 45/30 = 3/2.
Hence 18 * t = 18 * (3/2) = 27.

Your error was declaring `noncomputable def` inside abbrev, which expects a term. Also, there is no need for `noncomputable` here.

So the correct final answer in Lean is simply the real number 27.
