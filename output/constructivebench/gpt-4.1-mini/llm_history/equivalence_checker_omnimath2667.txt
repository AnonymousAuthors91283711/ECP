[check_equivalence] Problem: import Mathlib

open Real

abbrev omnimath2667_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2667 (x : ℝ) : 
  (2 + x + 10) / 3 = x ↔ x = omnimath2667_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation given is (2 + x + 10)/3 = x
2. Simplifying the left side: (12 + x)/3 = x
3. Multiply both sides by 3: 12 + x = 3x
4. Subtract x from both sides: 12 = 2x
5. Divide both sides by 2: x = 6

The ground truth answer correctly solves the equation to get x = 6. The proposed answer claims x = 4, which is incorrect based on the algebraic steps shown above.

<<<False>>>
