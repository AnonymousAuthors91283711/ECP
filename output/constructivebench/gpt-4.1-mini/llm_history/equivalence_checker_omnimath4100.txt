theorem omnimath4100 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∃ n, f n ≠ 0) ∧

Ground Truth Answer: fun a p x => a * (padicValNat p x)
Proposed Answer: fun a p n => a * (p ^ n)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a function f with three properties:
   - Non-zero for at least one input (∃ n, f n ≠ 0)
   - Multiplicative property (f(x*y) = f(x) + f(y))
   - Infinite set condition about function symmetry

2. The ground truth answer uses padicValNat, which counts the exponent of prime p in n's factorization. This satisfies:
   - padicValNat p (x*y) = padicValNat p x + padicValNat p y (multiplicative)
   - The other conditions would also hold for this function

3. The proposed answer is exponential (p^n) rather than counting exponents. This fails the multiplicative property:
   - f(x*y) = a*p^(x*y) ≠ a*p^x + a*p^y = f(x) + f(y)

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the key multiplicative condition, while the ground truth does. They are not equivalent.
