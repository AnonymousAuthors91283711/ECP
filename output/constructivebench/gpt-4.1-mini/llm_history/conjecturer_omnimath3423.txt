The error arises because the division of integers `3/8` is interpreted as rational division and Lean's `ℝ` type requires real division, which is a noncomputable operation in mathlib. To fix this, we should write the fraction using real literals or cast numerators and denominators to reals explicitly.

Using `3 / 8` as `3 / 8` will cause computability issues, so we should write `(3 : ℝ) / 8` to have Lean understand this as real division, not rational.

Hence, the correct expression for the answer is:

The error suggests Lean cannot compile the definition because it involves real division, which depends on noncomputable real number operations. Marking the answer as noncomputable fixes this problem.

Hence, the fixed answer is to mark `omnimath3423_answer` as `noncomputable` and provide the value `3 / 8` as a real number.

Explanation: The problem can be simplified from the equation y*(1 - p) = x where y = x*(1 + 0.6) = 1.6x, so

1.6x * (1 - p) = x  
1 - p = x / (1.6x) = 1 / 1.6 = 5/8  
p = 1 - 5/8 = 3/8  

Therefore, p = 3/8.

We just need to fix the compilation error by adding `noncomputable` as Lean cannot compute real division by default.

The error arises because division in real numbers in Lean requires noncomputable definitions due to the underlying analytic nature of ℝ. To fix the error, you should mark the definition as `noncomputable`. This tells Lean that the definition is not computable in the strict algorithmic sense, which is standard for real number expressions involving division.

Since your proposed answer is a constant real number `3 / 8`, we can define it as a `noncomputable` abbreviation to satisfy Lean's requirements.
