<<<201>>>>
Explanation: The last digit of k^k cycles with period 10 in k mod 10. The residue 1 appears for k mod 10 = 1 or 5 when raised to k. Checking patterns, the values ending with 1 are those k ≡ 1 or k ≡ 5 mod 10. Counting from 1 to 2013, there are 201 such numbers for each residue class, but only k ≡ 1 mod 10 yields last digit 1 for k^k. Hence, the count is 201.
