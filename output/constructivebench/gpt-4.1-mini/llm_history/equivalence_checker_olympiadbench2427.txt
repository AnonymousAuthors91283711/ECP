Ground Truth Answer: {(22 + 8 * sqrt 6, 22 - 8 * sqrt 6), (22 - 8 * sqrt 6, 22 + 8 * sqrt 6)}
Proposed Answer: { p : ℝ × ℝ | p.1 > 0 ∧ p.2 > 0 ∧ Real.sqrt p.1 + Real.sqrt p.2 = 8 ∧ p.1 * p.2 = 100 }
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives two conditions:
   - √a + √b = 8
   - log₁₀a + log₁₀b = 2 (which implies log₁₀(ab) = 2, so ab = 10² = 100)

2. The ground truth answer provides two specific solutions that satisfy these conditions.

3. The proposed answer gives a set description that includes:
   - a > 0 and b > 0 (necessary for square roots and logs)
   - √a + √b = 8
   - a*b = 100 (from the log condition)

The proposed answer is essentially describing all possible solutions that satisfy the given conditions, while the ground truth answer gives the explicit solutions. The two answers are equivalent because:
- The ground truth solutions satisfy all conditions in the proposed answer
- The proposed answer's conditions would lead to exactly the ground truth solutions when solved

The only difference is that one is explicit while the other is descriptive, but they represent the same solution set.
