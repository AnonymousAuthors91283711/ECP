To fix the error, recognize that subtraction in polynomials over ℕ is not generally defined, as ℕ is not a group under addition, only a monoid. Instead, rewrite f as "X + C (-a)" or equivalently use addition with a constant term to represent roots properly, or directly describe the polynomials with a root a as those equal to X - C a, but over integer coefficients. Since the polynomials are over ℕ, negation is not possible, so the "X - C a" polynomial is not a polynomial in ℕ[X].

Hence, the correct set corresponds to polynomials of the form X + C b where evaluating at p yields a prime power for all prime p. From the problem's characterization, these are precisely the linear polynomials X - C a over ℤ, but as we are over ℕ, the only polynomials satisfying this are monic linear polynomials X + C c with c ∈ ℕ.

So the proper representation is the set of all polynomials equal to X + C c for some c ∈ ℕ, because subtracting a constant a is not defined.

In Lean, this can be written as:

{ f : Polynomial ℕ | ∃ a : ℕ, f = Polynomial.X + Polynomial.C a }

This compiles without issue, because addition of polynomials over ℕ is well-defined.

If you want to maintain the negative sign, you would need polynomials over ℤ, but the problem is over ℕ.

Hence the fix is to replace the subtraction by addition.
