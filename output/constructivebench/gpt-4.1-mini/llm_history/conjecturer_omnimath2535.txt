The error arises because you are trying to write a set expression directly as a value of type ℝ. The abbreviation `omnimath2535_answer : ℝ` expects a real number, but your proposed answer is a set expression. Actually, the problem requires the sum of the two roots, not the set itself.

Looking at the equation:

\( (x^2 + 2x + 3)^{(x^2 + 2x + 3)^{(x^2 + 2x + 3)}} = 2012 \).

Set \( y = x^2 + 2x + 3 \). Then the equation becomes

\( y^{y^y} = 2012 \).

If \( y > 0 \), we can set

\( y^{y^y} = 2012 \implies y^{y^y} = 2012 \), so let

\( t = y^y \),

then \( y^{t} = 2012 \). Since \( t = y^y \), we need to find \( y \) such that:

\( y^{y^y} = 2012 \).

Based on the enumerated answers and the problem structure, the values of \( y \) must be equal (both solutions) and satisfy

\( y^{y} = 2012^{1/2012} \), or reasoning similarly we find the two solutions for \( x \), via

\[
y = 2012^{1/2012}
\]

and then since

\[
y = x^2 + 2x + 3 = (x + 1)^2 + 2,
\]

set

\[
(x + 1)^2 = y - 2 = 2012^{1/2012} - 2,
\]

so

\[
x + 1 = \pm \sqrt{2012^{1/2012} - 2}.
\]

Hence, the two solutions for \( x \):

\[
x = -1 \pm \sqrt{2012^{1/2012} - 2}.
\]

The answer set \( s \) contains these two numbers, and their sum is

\[
(-1 + \sqrt{2012^{1/2012} - 2}) + (-1 - \sqrt{2012^{1/2012} - 2}) = -2.
\]

Therefore, the sum is simply \(-2\).

---

Thus the correct Lean expression for `omnimath2535_answer : ℝ` is \(-2\).
