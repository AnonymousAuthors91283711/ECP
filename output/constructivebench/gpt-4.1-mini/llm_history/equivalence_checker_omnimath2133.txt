Ground Truth Answer: 2017
Proposed Answer: 1 * 4^0 + 0 * 4^1 + 2 * 4^2 + 0 * 4^3 + 1 * 4^4 + 2 * 4^5 + 1 * 4^6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is computing the sum of a list where each element is d * 4^p, with d and p coming from parallel lists [1,0,2,0,1,2,1] and [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] respectively.

2. The ground truth answer is 2017.

3. The proposed answer shows the expanded form of the computation: 
   1*4^0 + 0*4^1 + 2*4^2 + 0*4^3 + 1*4^4 + 2*4^5 + 1*4^6

Let's verify if the proposed answer equals 2017:
1*1 + 0*4 + 2*16 + 0*64 + 1*256 + 2*1024 + 1*4096
= 1 + 0 + 32 + 0 + 256 + 2048 + 4096
= (1+32) + (256+2048) + 4096
= 33 + 2304 + 4096
= 2337 + 4096
= 6433

This does not equal 2017, so the proposed answer is incorrect in its final result, though the expression form is correct.

<<<False>>>
