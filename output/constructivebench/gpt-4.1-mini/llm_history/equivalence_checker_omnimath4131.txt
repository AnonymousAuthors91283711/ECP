Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 16
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n such that:
   - There exists a sequence of n positive integers (each ≤15)
   - The sum of their factorials ≡ 2001 mod 10000

2. Ground truth answer is 3, which means there exists a triple (a,b,c) where:
   - 0 < a,b,c ≤ 15
   - a! + b! + c! ≡ 2001 mod 10000

3. Proposed answer is 16, which would mean we need 16 numbers to achieve this.

4. Checking small cases:
   - The maximum single factorial ≤15! is 15! = 1307674368000 ≡ 8000 mod 10000
   - 2001 mod 10000 can be achieved with smaller combinations (e.g., 6! + 7! + 8! = 720 + 5040 + 40320 = 46080 ≡ 6080 mod 10000, but other combinations might work)
   - It's highly unlikely we'd need 16 numbers since factorials grow rapidly and we can reach large numbers with few terms

5. The proposed answer (16) is much larger than necessary and contradicts the ground truth (3).
