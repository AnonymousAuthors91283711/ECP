The problem asks for the greatest prime divisor of factorial 15 minus factorial 13.

Note: factorial 15 = 15!, factorial 13 = 13!, and (15! - 13!) = 13! ( (14*15) - 1 ) = 13! * (210 - 1) = 13! * 209.

Prime divisors of 13! are all primes ≤ 13.

209 = 11 * 19 (since 19*11=209).

So prime factors are primes ≤ 13 and also possibly primes dividing 209.

Then prime factors of (15! - 13!) are primes dividing 13! (i.e. primes ≤ 13) and primes dividing 209 (i.e. 11, 19).

Among these, 19 is the largest prime dividing (15! - 13!).

So the answer is 19.

<<<19>>>
