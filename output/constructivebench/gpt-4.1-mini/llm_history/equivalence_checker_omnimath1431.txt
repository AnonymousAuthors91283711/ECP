noncomputable abbrev omnimath1431_answer : ‚Ñù := sorry
theorem omnimath1431 : 
  sin (1998 + 237) * sin (1998 - 1653) = omnimath1431_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: -1/4
Proposed Answer: sin 2235 * sin 345
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to simplify the expression sin(1998 + 237) * sin(1998 - 1653)

2. Ground truth answer is -1/4

3. Proposed answer is sin 2235 * sin 345

First, let's evaluate the proposed answer:
- 1998 + 237 = 2235
- 1998 - 1653 = 345
So the proposed answer is exactly the expanded form of the original expression, with no simplification applied.

The ground truth answer shows that when you properly simplify this expression using trigonometric identities, you get -1/4. The proposed answer doesn't show this simplification, it just expands the arguments.

Therefore, while the proposed answer is mathematically correct as an expansion, it's not equivalent to the simplified ground truth answer.
