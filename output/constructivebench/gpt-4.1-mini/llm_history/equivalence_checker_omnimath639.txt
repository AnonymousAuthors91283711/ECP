Ground Truth Answer: 4/3
Proposed Answer: (Real.sqrt 17 + 1) / (Real.sqrt 19 - 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the maximum value of the ratio |√17 - z| / |i√19 - z| where |z| = 1.

2. The ground truth answer is 4/3 ≈ 1.333...

3. The proposed answer is (√17 + 1)/(√19 - 1) ≈ (4.123 + 1)/(4.359 - 1) ≈ 5.123/3.359 ≈ 1.525

The two answers are numerically different (1.333 vs 1.525), and the proposed answer doesn't simplify to 4/3. 

The proposed answer appears to be using the maximum distances (adding 1 to numerator, subtracting 1 from denominator), but this approach doesn't yield the correct maximum ratio in this case.
