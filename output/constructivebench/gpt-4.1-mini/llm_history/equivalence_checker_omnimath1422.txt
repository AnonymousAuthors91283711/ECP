Ground Truth Answer: {r : ℝ | r > 3 ∨ r < 49 / 27}
Proposed Answer: {r | ∃ z : ℂ, z.im ≠ 0 ∧ r = (z ^ 3 + z ^ 2 - z + 2).re}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer captures the essence of the problem by focusing on non-real complex numbers (z.im ≠ 0) and their images under P, but it's not exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer. The ground truth explicitly gives the range (r > 3 ∨ r < 49/27) while the proposed answer describes the set in terms of existence conditions. They describe the same mathematical object, but the proposed answer doesn't provide the explicit interval bounds given in the ground truth. The answers are mathematically equivalent in meaning but not in form.
