    totient (p * q) = 3 * p + q ↔ p + q = mathodyssey22_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 14
Proposed Answer: 5
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves Euler's totient function (φ) for the product of two primes p and q where p < q.
2. We know that for distinct primes p and q, φ(p*q) = (p-1)*(q-1).
3. The equation given is φ(p*q) = 3p + q, which becomes (p-1)(q-1) = 3p + q.
4. Expanding and simplifying: pq - p - q + 1 = 3p + q → pq - 4p - 2q + 1 = 0
5. We can rewrite this as (p-2)(q-4) = 7
6. Since p and q are primes and p < q, the only solution is p=3, q=11 (since 7 is prime and factors are (1,7))
7. Then p + q = 3 + 11 = 14

The ground truth answer is 14, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 5, which is incorrect.
