Ground Truth Answer: fun _ => 0
Proposed Answer: fun x => if x = 0 then 0 else 0
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer `fun x => if x = 0 then 0 else 0` is equivalent to the ground truth answer `fun _ => 0` because both functions return 0 for all real inputs, regardless of the condition. The conditional check in the proposed answer is redundant since both branches return the same value (0). Therefore, the two answers are functionally identical.
