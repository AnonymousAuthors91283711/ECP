  ∃ (l : List ℕ), l.Nodup ∧ l ⊆ [2, 3, 4, 6] ∧ l.length = 3 ∧ l.sum = 11 ∧ l.prod = omnimath2745_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 36
Proposed Answer: 11
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find a list of 3 distinct numbers from {2,3,4,6} that sum to 11, and then provide the product of those numbers.

2. The ground truth answer is 36, which corresponds to the list [2,3,6] (since 2+3+6=11 and 2×3×6=36).

3. The proposed answer is 11, which would be the sum, not the product. This is clearly incorrect as the problem specifically asks for the product (l.prod).

The proposed answer is giving the sum value instead of the required product value, so it's incorrect.
