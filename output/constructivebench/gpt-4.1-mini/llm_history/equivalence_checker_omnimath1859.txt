Ground Truth Answer: 32
Proposed Answer: 14
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have a system of 2 linear equations with 3 variables:
   - x + 2y - 3z = 7
   - 2x - y + 2z = 6

2. We're asked to find the value of 8x + y.

3. The ground truth answer is 32, while the proposed answer is 14.

To verify, let's solve the system:

From h1: x = 7 - 2y + 3z
Substitute into h2:
2(7 - 2y + 3z) - y + 2z = 6
14 - 4y + 6z - y + 2z = 6
-5y + 8z = -8 → 5y = 8z + 8 → y = (8z + 8)/5

Now express 8x + y:
8x + y = 8(7 - 2y + 3z) + y = 56 - 16y + 24z + y = 56 - 15y + 24z
Substitute y:
= 56 - 15(8z + 8)/5 + 24z
= 56 - 3(8z + 8) + 24z
= 56 - 24z - 24 + 24z
= 32

The calculation shows the correct answer is indeed 32, not 14.
