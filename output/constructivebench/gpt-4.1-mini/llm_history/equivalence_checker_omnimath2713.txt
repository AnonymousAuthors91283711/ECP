theorem omnimath2713 :
  ∃! N, 400 < N ∧ N < 600 ∧ Odd N ∧ 5 ∣ N ∧ 11 ∣ N ∧
  (digits 10 N).sum = omnimath2713_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 18
Proposed Answer: 55 * 11
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a unique natural number N between 400 and 600 that is odd, divisible by both 5 and 11, and whose digit sum equals some value (omnimath2713_answer).

2. The ground truth answer gives the digit sum as 18.

3. The proposed answer suggests 55 * 11 = 605 as a solution, but:
   - 605 is indeed divisible by both 5 and 11 (5*11*11)
   - It is odd
   - However, 605 is not between 400 and 600 (it's >600)
   - The digit sum of 605 is 6+0+5 = 11, not 18

The proposed answer fails on two counts: it's outside the required range and has the wrong digit sum. Therefore, it's not equivalent to the ground truth answer.
