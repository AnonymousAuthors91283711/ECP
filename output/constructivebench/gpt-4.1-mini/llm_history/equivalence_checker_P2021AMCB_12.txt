Ground Truth Answer: 184/5
Proposed Answer: 104/3
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a set S of natural numbers with:
   - Maximum element maxS = minS + 72
   - Three different average conditions when excluding certain elements
   - We need to find the average of all elements in S

2. The ground truth answer is 184/5 (36.8)
3. The proposed answer is 104/3 (≈34.666...)

The two answers are numerically quite different (36.8 vs 34.666). For this type of problem with specific constraints, there should only be one correct solution. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth, and the difference is too large to be a calculation error.
