abbrev P2023AMCB_1_answer : â„š := sorry
theorem P2023AMCB_1 : 
  let total := 3 + (1/3)
  let target := total / 4
  let transfer := target - (1/3)
  P2023AMCB_1_answer = transfer / 3 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1/6
Proposed Answer: 1/9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem defines:
   - total = 3 + (1/3) = 10/3
   - target = total / 4 = (10/3)/4 = 10/12 = 5/6
   - transfer = target - (1/3) = 5/6 - 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2

2. The theorem states P2023AMCB_1_answer = transfer / 3 = (1/2)/3 = 1/6

3. Ground truth answer is 1/6 (matches the calculation)
4. Proposed answer is 1/9 (does not match)

The proposed answer is incorrect based on the given problem statement and calculations.

<<<False>>>
