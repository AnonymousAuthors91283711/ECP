The error occurs because the definition uses `Real.sqrt`, which is not computable in Lean's core logic without marking the definition as `noncomputable`. To fix this, simply mark the answer as `noncomputable`.

Given the conditions:
- \(T = 4\sqrt{5}\)
- \(xy = \sqrt{5}\)
- \(yz = 5\)
- \(xz = T = 4\sqrt{5}\)

From these, we want to solve for \(x\).

First, compute:
\[
(xy)(yz) = x y^2 z = \sqrt{5} \cdot 5 = 5\sqrt{5}
\]
and also:
\[
(xz) y = T y = 4\sqrt{5} y
\]

From \(x y^2 z = 5\sqrt{5}\) and \(x z = 4\sqrt{5}\), we can find expressions for \(x, y, z\). Solving these leads to \(x = 20 \sqrt{5}\).

Hence, the final answer expression is \(20 \times \sqrt{5}\).

Below is the corrected Lean expression marked as `noncomputable`:

The error arises because you are trying to declare `noncomputable abbrev` and also redeclare `olympiadbench2898_answer` twice. Instead, you should declare it once, and if the expression involves noncomputable operations (like `Real.sqrt`), use the `noncomputable` keyword once before the definition, not inside.

Analyzing the equations:

Given:
- \( T = 4 \sqrt{5} \)
- \( x y = \sqrt{5} \)
- \( y z = 5 \)
- \( x z = T = 4 \sqrt{5} \)

We want to find \( x \).

From the first two product equations:

\[
x y = \sqrt{5}, \quad y z = 5, \quad x z = 4 \sqrt{5}
\]

Divide the last by the first:

\[
\frac{x z}{x y} = \frac{4 \sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}} = 4 = \frac{z}{y}
\implies z = 4 y
\]

From \( y z = 5 \),

\[
y (4 y) = 5 \implies 4 y^2 = 5 \implies y^2 = \frac{5}{4} \implies y = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

Then,

\[
x y = \sqrt{5} \implies x = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{y} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}/2} = 2
\]

But this conflicts with \( x z = 4 \sqrt{5} \).

Given \( z = 4 y \), we get:

\[
x z = x (4 y) = 4 x y = 4 \sqrt{5}
\]

This matches the given \( T \), so our calculation of \( x = 2 \) is consistent.

So the value of \( x \) is 2.

Thus, the answer is \( 2 \), not \( 20 \sqrt{5} \).

Therefore, the correct `olympiadbench2898_answer` is just `2`.

In Lean, define it directly as `2`.
