Ground Truth Answer: fun x k => x^k + (1/x)^k
Proposed Answer: fun (x k : ℝ) => (x ^ k) + (x ^ (-k))
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer:

1. The ground truth is: fun x k => x^k + (1/x)^k
2. The proposed answer is: fun (x k : ℝ) => (x ^ k) + (x ^ (-k))

These are mathematically equivalent because:
- (1/x)^k = x^(-k) by exponent rules
- The variable ordering and parentheses don't affect the mathematical meaning

The proposed answer is just a more compact way of writing the same function, using the exponentiation property that x^(-k) = 1/(x^k).
