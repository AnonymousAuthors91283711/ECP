Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 4, 6, 16)}
Proposed Answer: {(2, 5, 8, 10), (4, 5, 7, 10), (1, 8, 9, 10)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all quadruples (a,b,c,d) where a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d and the set {ab+cd, ac+bd, ad+bc} equals {40, 70, 100}.

2. Ground truth gives only one solution: (1,4,6,16). Let's verify:
   - ab+cd = 1*4 + 6*16 = 4 + 96 = 100
   - ac+bd = 1*6 + 4*16 = 6 + 64 = 70
   - ad+bc = 1*16 + 4*6 = 16 + 24 = 40
   This satisfies the condition.

3. Proposed answer gives three solutions. Let's check the first one (2,5,8,10):
   - ab+cd = 10 + 80 = 90 ≠ any in {40,70,100}
   Already fails. The other two also don't satisfy the condition.

The proposed answer is completely wrong as none of the solutions satisfy the given condition.
