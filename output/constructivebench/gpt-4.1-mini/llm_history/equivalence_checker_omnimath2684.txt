Ground Truth Answer: 71
Proposed Answer: 33 + 43 + 53 + 63 + 73 + 83 + 93
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the sum of all two-digit numbers (10-99) where 109 modulo x equals 4 (i.e., 109 % x = 4).

2. The ground truth answer is 71.

3. The proposed answer lists several numbers (33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, 93) and their sum would be much larger than 71.

4. Checking the condition for these numbers:
   - 109 % 33 = 10 ≠ 4
   - 109 % 43 = 23 ≠ 4
   - etc. None of these satisfy 109 % x = 4.

5. The correct numbers satisfying 109 % x = 4 are actually 15, 21, and 35 (15+21+35=71).

The proposed answer is completely incorrect both in terms of the numbers listed and their sum.
