theorem P2008AIMEI_12 :
  IsGreatest {M : ℕ | ∃ (v : ℝ) (h : 0 < v), 
    let carLength := 4;
    let minGap := carLength * ⌈v / 15⌉;
    let timeGap := (carLength + minGap) / v;
    M = floor (3600 / timeGap)}

<<<36>>> 
The maximum M corresponds to the maximum number of cars per hour given the speed v and gap conditions, achieved at v = 15 mph, yielding M = 36.
