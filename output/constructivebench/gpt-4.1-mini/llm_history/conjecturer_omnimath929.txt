The main error is that you are trying to define functions and state the equality inside the abbrev `omnimath929_answer : ℝ`, which should just be a real number expression, not a complex tuple or proof. The functions F and L should be defined separately as needed, but your answer should just be the numeric real value of the ratio expression.

Given the Fibonacci and Lucas sequences formulas:

- Fibonacci: \( F(n) = \frac{\phi^n - \psi^n}{\sqrt{5}} \) where \(\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\), \(\psi = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\).
- Lucas: \( L(n) = \phi^n + \psi^n \).

Your problem involves the product:

\[
\frac{\prod_{n=1}^{15} \frac{F(2n)}{F(n)}}{\prod_{n=1}^{13} L(n)} = ?
\]

From calculations or pattern exploration, this ratio simplifies to 4, a nice constant.

So the final answer to put in `omnimath929_answer` should just be `4`.

You don't need to define functions F and L inside the answer; it is just a numeric constant.

Using the updated syntax for products in Lean: `∏ n ∈ Finset.Icc 1 15, ...` instead of `∏ n in ...`

Hence, the fixed version of your final answer is:

<<<4>>>
