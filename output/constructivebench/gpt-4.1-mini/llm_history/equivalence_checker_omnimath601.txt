theorem omnimath601 : 
  {s : ℂ | ∃ (r : ℂ), s = 1 / (1 - r) ∧ r ^ 2013 = 1 / (2013 : ℂ) ^ 2013} = omnimath601_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: { (2013 : ℂ) ^ 2014 / ((2013 : ℂ) ^ 2013 - 1) }
Proposed Answer: {s : ℂ | ∃ (w : ℂ), w ^ 2013 = 1 ∧ s = 1 / (1 - (w / (2013 : ℂ)))}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the set of complex numbers s that can be expressed as s = 1/(1-r) where r satisfies r^2013 = 1/2013^2013.

2. Ground Truth Answer gives a single explicit value: 2013^2014/(2013^2013 - 1)

3. Proposed Answer gives a set of values parameterized by w where w^2013 = 1, with s = 1/(1 - w/2013)

To check equivalence:
- Let r = w/2013 in the original problem statement
- Then r^2013 = (w/2013)^2013 = w^2013/2013^2013 = 1/2013^2013 (since w^2013=1)
- This matches the original condition r^2013 = 1/2013^2013
- The expression for s is identical in both forms

The Ground Truth Answer appears to be one specific solution (when w=1), while the Proposed Answer gives all possible solutions (for all 2013 roots of unity w). Therefore, the Ground Truth Answer is a subset of the Proposed Answer.
