The error in your code snippet is that you cannot put `let` statements directly inside the set comprehension `{t : ℕ | ... }`. In Lean, you can't use `let` bindings inside expressions like that; instead, you should introduce those expressions directly as equalities or rewrite the condition to avoid the `let` statements.

Here, the problem is about finding the least natural number t such that there exist positive rationals p, h1, h2 with h1 ≠ h2 satisfying the linear equations built from work times depending on t.

From the problem statement, the work times are:

workTimeMon = 480 - t  
workTimeTue = 372 - t  
workTimeWed = 672 - t

with constraints:

(p + h1 + h2) * workTimeMon = 1/2  
(h1 + h2) * workTimeTue = 24/100  
p * workTimeWed = 1/2

with p, h1, h2 > 0 and h1 ≠ h2.

The natural candidate for the answer is 96 (from problem prompt). So your answer is `96`.

Your code should define 

`P2012AMCA_13_answer : ℕ := 96`

without let bindings inside the set definition.

Hence, the fix is to remove `let` and rewrite the conditions explicitly by introducing the expressions workTimeMon := 480 - t inline in the formula.

Hence, the correct answer expression is just:
