Ground Truth Answer: (fun k => 16 * k ^ (4 / 19))
Proposed Answer: fun k => (524288 * k)^(4 / 19)
Let's analyze the equivalence of the two answers:

1. The ground truth answer is: 16 * k^(4/19)
2. The proposed answer is: (524288 * k)^(4/19)

We can simplify the proposed answer:
(524288 * k)^(4/19) = 524288^(4/19) * k^(4/19) = (2^19)^(4/19) * k^(4/19) = 2^(19*(4/19)) * k^(4/19) = 2^4 * k^(4/19) = 16 * k^(4/19)

This matches exactly with the ground truth answer. The proposed answer is just an unsimplified form of the correct solution.
