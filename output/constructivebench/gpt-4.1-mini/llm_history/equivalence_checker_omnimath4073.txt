Ground Truth Answer: (2, -14)
Proposed Answer: (7, -14)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves finding real numbers (a,b) such that for polynomials Q and P defined as:
   - Q = X³ - 21X + 35
   - P = X² + aX + b
   There exist distinct real roots r,s,t of Q satisfying P(r)=s, P(s)=t, P(t)=r.

2. The ground truth answer is (2, -14).

3. The proposed answer is (7, -14).

Analysis:
- The second coordinate (-14) matches in both answers.
- The first coordinate differs (2 vs 7).
- For the system to work, the coefficients must satisfy certain relationships derived from the conditions P(r)=s, etc.
- Testing with the ground truth (2,-14):
  The polynomial P = X² + 2X -14 would correctly cycle the roots.
- Testing with (7,-14):
  The polynomial P = X² + 7X -14 would not satisfy the required cycling property for the roots of Q.

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the problem's conditions.
