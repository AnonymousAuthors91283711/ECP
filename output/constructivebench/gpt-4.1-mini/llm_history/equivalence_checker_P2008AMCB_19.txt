Ground Truth Answer: Real.sqrt 2
Proposed Answer: 2 * (13^(1/4))
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal value of |α| + |γ| under certain constraints involving complex quadratic functions evaluated at z=1 and z=i.

2. The ground truth answer is √2 ≈ 1.4142

3. The proposed answer is 2*(13^(1/4)) ≈ 2*1.8988 ≈ 3.7976

The two answers are numerically quite different (1.4142 vs 3.7976), and there's no obvious mathematical transformation that would make them equivalent. The proposed answer is significantly larger than the ground truth answer.
