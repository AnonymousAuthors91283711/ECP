(x : ℝ)
(hx : (x / 100) * 60 = 12)
: (15 / 100) * x = omnimath2816_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 20
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us the equation (x/100)*60 = 12 and asks us to find the value of (15/100)*x.

2. Solving the given equation:
   (x/100)*60 = 12
   => x*60 = 1200
   => x = 1200/60
   => x = 20

3. Now calculating (15/100)*x:
   (15/100)*20 = 3

The ground truth answer is 3, which is correct. The proposed answer is 20, which is actually the value of x, not the final answer being asked for.
