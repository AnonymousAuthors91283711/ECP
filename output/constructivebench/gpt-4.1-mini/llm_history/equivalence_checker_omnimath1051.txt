Ground Truth Answer: 875
Proposed Answer: (555^(555)) % 1000
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem defines a recursive function W with special cases:
   - W n 0 = n^n
   - W n k = W (W n (k-1)) (k-1) for k > 0

2. We're asked to compute W 555 2 mod 1000

3. The proposed answer suggests (555^555) mod 1000, which would be W 555 0 mod 1000

4. But W 555 2 requires two recursive steps:
   - First compute W 555 1 = W (W 555 0) 0 = W (555^555) 0 = (555^555)^(555^555)
   - Then compute W 555 2 = W (W 555 1) 1 = W ((555^555)^(555^555)) 1 = ... (even larger)

The proposed answer only computes the first step (k=0 case) and misses the recursive nature of the problem. The ground truth answer 875 comes from properly evaluating the recursion.
