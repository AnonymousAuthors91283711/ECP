Ground Truth Answer: fun n => ⌊log 2 n⌋₊ + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n => n
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal sum s where s is defined as the sum of a[i].val/(i.val+1) over all i in Fin n, for some bijective function a.

2. The ground truth answer suggests that the minimal sum is floor(log₂ n) + 1.

3. The proposed answer suggests that the minimal sum is simply n.

Let's think about simple cases:
- For n=1: log₂1=0, so ground truth gives 1. Proposed answer also gives 1. They match.
- For n=2: log₂2=1, so ground truth gives 2. Proposed answer gives 2. They match.
- For n=3: log₂3≈1.58, floor gives 1, so ground truth gives 2. Proposed answer gives 3. They differ.
- For n=4: log₂4=2, ground truth gives 3. Proposed answer gives 4. They differ.

The answers only match for n=1 and n=2, but diverge for larger n. The ground truth answer grows logarithmically while the proposed answer grows linearly.
