Explanation:
The error occurs because in Lean, to define a set comprehension over pairs (m, n), the syntax is `set` notation with an explicit lambda `λ` binding or using `Set` with a predicate, and variables must be introduced explicitly in the binder, not just assumed. The notation `{(m, n) | ...}` is not directly recognized because `m` and `n` are unknown identifiers without binding. Also, Lean’s `Set α` expects a predicate `α → Prop`. So the correct way is to define a set of pairs `(m, n) : ℕ × ℕ` such that the predicate on `m, n` holds.

Hence, a proper definition uses something like:
```lean
{ p : ℕ × ℕ | p.1 > 0 ∧ p.2 > 0 ∧ p.1 * p.2 = p.2^2 - p.2 + 1 }
```
or equivalently
```lean
{ (m, n) | m > 0 ∧ n > 0 ∧ m * n = n^2 - n + 1 }
```
but the above requires lambda-like binders in Lean using set notation: 
```lean
{p : ℕ × ℕ | ... }
```
and inside the set bracket, you use projections `p.1` and `p.2` or pattern matching with `λ` to define the property.

Therefore,
```lean
{ p : ℕ × ℕ | p.1 > 0 ∧ p.2 > 0 ∧ p.1 * p.2 = p.2^2 - p.2 + 1 }
```
is the right way.

This set is a closed form candidate solution since the problem states `(m * n - 1) | ((n^2 - n + 1)^2)`, and the enumerated answers suggest `m * n = n^2 - n + 1` is the exact solution. In other words, the divisor condition is satisfied exactly when `m * n` equals `n^2 - n + 1`.

Thus the corrected Lean code for `omnimath57_answer` is:
<<<
{ p : ℕ × ℕ | p.1 > 0 ∧ p.2 > 0 ∧ p.1 * p.2 = p.2^2 - p.2 + 1 }
