  ∑ k in Finset.range (2^2014), (k ^^^ (k / 2)) = omnimath2173_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2^2013 * (2^2014 - 1)
Proposed Answer: 2^(2014 + 2013) - 1
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: 2^2013 * (2^2014 - 1)
2. Proposed: 2^(2014 + 2013) - 1

Let's simplify both expressions:
- Ground Truth: 2^2013 * 2^2014 - 2^2013 = 2^(2013+2014) - 2^2013 = 2^4027 - 2^2013
- Proposed: 2^4027 - 1

These are clearly different expressions. The proposed answer is missing the -2^2013 term from the ground truth and has an incorrect -1 instead.

<<<False>>>
