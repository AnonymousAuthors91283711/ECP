(hprod : 3 ^ x * 5 ^ y = 225)

Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us the equation 3^x * 5^y = 225 with x,y > 0
2. First, factorize 225: 225 = 15^2 = (3*5)^2 = 3^2 * 5^2
3. Therefore, the only solution is x=2 and y=2
4. Thus x + y = 4

The ground truth answer is correct (4), while the proposed answer (2) is incorrect as it only accounts for one of the variables (either x or y) but not their sum.
