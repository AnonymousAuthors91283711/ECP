The error arises because `burgers`, `sides`, and `drinks` are variables local to the theorem, and thus cannot be directly referenced in the global abbreviation. Since their values are fixed by the hypotheses (`burgers = 5`, `sides = 3`, `drinks = 12`), we can compute the product directly using these constants.

Therefore, the closed form is just 5 * 3 * 12.

<<<5 * 3 * 12>>>
