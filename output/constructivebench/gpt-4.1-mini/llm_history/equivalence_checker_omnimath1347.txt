Ground Truth Answer: 224/225
Proposed Answer: 132 - 137/196
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer: 224/225 ≈ 0.995555...
2. Proposed Answer: 132 - 137/196 = (132*196 - 137)/196 = (25872 - 137)/196 = 25735/196 ≈ 131.3010...

The two answers are clearly different in value (0.995... vs 131.301...). The proposed answer is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
