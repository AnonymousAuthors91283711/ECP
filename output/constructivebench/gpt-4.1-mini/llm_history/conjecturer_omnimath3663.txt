theorem omnimath3663 :
  (∃ f : ℝ → ℝ, (∀ y : ℝ, ∃ x : ℝ, f x = y) ∧ (∀ x : ℝ, f (f x) = (x - 1) * f x + 2)) ↔ omnimath3663_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Prop
<<<∃ f : ℝ → ℝ, (∀ y : ℝ, ∃ x : ℝ, f x = y) ∧ (∀ x : ℝ, f (f x) = (x - 1) * f x + 2) ↔ ∃ a b : ℝ, (f = (fun x => a * x + b)) ∧ (a ≠ 0) ∧ (a^2 = a - 1) ∧ (2 * a * b = -b)>>>

Explanation: The functional equation and surjectivity imply f is affine f(x)=ax+b with a satisfying a²=a−1 and b constrained by 2ab=−b; this characterizes the existence of f.
