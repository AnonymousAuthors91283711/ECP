abbrev olympiadbench2323_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2323 :
  {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (n ^ 2 + n + 15) % n = 0} = olympiadbench2323_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The condition is 0 < n and (n ^ 2 + n + 15) % n = 0. Since (n^2 + n + 15) mod n = (n^2 mod n + n mod n + 15 mod n) mod n = (0 + 0 + 15) mod n = 15 mod n, the condition reduces to 15 % n = 0, so n divides 15 and n > 0.

Therefore olympiadbench2323_answer = { n | n divides 15 ∧ n > 0 } = {1,3,5,15}.

In Lean, the set of positive divisors of 15 can be expressed as {n | n ∣ 15 ∧ 0 < n}.
