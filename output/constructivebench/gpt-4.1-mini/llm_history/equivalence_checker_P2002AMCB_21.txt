Ground Truth Answer: 448
Proposed Answer: (2001 / 11) + (2001 / 13) + (2001 / 14) - (2001 / (11 * 13)) - (2001 / (11 * 14)) - (2001 / (13 * 14)) + 6 * (2001 / (11 * 13 * 14))
Let me analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem defines a function `a(n)` that assigns different values based on divisibility by 11, 13, and 14. The sum is taken from 0 to 2001 (Finset.range 2002).

2. The proposed answer uses the inclusion-exclusion principle to count numbers divisible by various combinations of 11, 13, and 14, with coefficients matching the values in `a(n)`:
   - +1 for each number divisible by 11, 13, or 14 alone
   - -1 for pairs (to correct double counting)
   - +6 for numbers divisible by all three (11,13,14)

3. However, there are issues:
   - The coefficients for pairs don't match the `a(n)` function (should be -4, -3, -2 instead of -1 for each pair)
   - The final term should be +6 - (4+3+2) = -3, not +6
   - The ground truth is 448, while the proposed formula gives a different result

The proposed answer incorrectly applies inclusion-exclusion by not properly accounting for the different weights in `a(n)`.
