Ground Truth Answer: 1 / 1002
Proposed Answer: (1 - (2005 / 2004))^3
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is about finding three complex numbers z₁, z₂, z₃ that satisfy certain conditions involving their real and imaginary parts, and then evaluating a product expression involving these numbers.

Key observations:
1. The conditions on the real and imaginary parts suggest we're dealing with cube roots or solutions to a cubic equation.
2. The ground truth answer is 1/1002, which is approximately 0.000998.
3. The proposed answer is (1 - (2005/2004))^3 ≈ (1 - 1.000499)^3 ≈ (-0.000499)^3 ≈ -1.24×10^-10.

The proposed answer is negative and extremely small in magnitude, while the ground truth is positive and about 0.001. They are clearly different in both sign and magnitude.

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
