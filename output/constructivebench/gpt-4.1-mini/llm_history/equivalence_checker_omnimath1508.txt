Ground Truth Answer: 1/11
Proposed Answer: (1/4)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves an infinite series of Fibonacci numbers divided by powers of 4.
2. The ground truth answer is 1/11, which is correct based on known results of Fibonacci generating functions.
3. The proposed answer is 1/4, which is clearly different from 1/11.

The proposed answer is incorrect. The correct evaluation of this series should indeed be 1/11, not 1/4. The difference is substantial and not just a matter of domain restrictions or minor errors.

<<<False>>>
