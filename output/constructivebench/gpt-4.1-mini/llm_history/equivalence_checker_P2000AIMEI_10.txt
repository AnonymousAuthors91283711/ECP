abbrev P2000AIMEI_10_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2000AIMEI_10 :
  ∃! (x : Fin 100 → ℚ),
    (∀ k : Fin 100, x k = (∑ i, x i) - x k - k.val) ∧
    x ⟨49, by simp⟩ = P2000AIMEI_10_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 8600 / 99
Proposed Answer: (100:ℚ) * 49 / 101
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is setting up a system of 100 equations where each x_k equals the sum of all x_i minus x_k minus k (for k from 0 to 99).

2. The ground truth answer is 8600/99 ≈ 86.8687

3. The proposed answer is (100*49)/101 ≈ 4900/101 ≈ 48.5149

The two answers are clearly different in value (86.8687 vs 48.5149). The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth, and the difference is substantial (not just a simplification or domain issue).
