abbrev omnimath1670_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1670 :
  ∃ (f : ℤ[X]), f = X^4 + C (a : ℤ) * X^3 + C (b : ℤ) * X^2 + C (c : ℤ) * X + C (d : ℤ) ∧
  (∀ (r : ℤ), f.IsRoot r → r < 0) ∧
  a + b + c + d = 2009 ∧
  d = omnimath1670_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<2009>>>  
Explanation: Since all integer roots are negative and the polynomial is monic, the sum of roots (−a) is balanced with integer coefficients summing to 2009, and the constant term d equals 2009. Hence omnimath1670_answer = 2009.
