Ground Truth Answer: Real.sqrt 19
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves trigonometric identities and equations with multiple variables (α, β, γ, δ) under certain constraints.

2. The ground truth answer is √19 ≈ 4.3589, while the proposed answer is simply 4.

3. The difference between 4 and √19 is significant (about 8.2% relative error), and there's no mathematical transformation that would make these equivalent.

4. The proposed answer doesn't match the complexity of the problem, which suggests it might be an incorrect simplification or guess.

Since the answers are clearly different and not equivalent, the correct response is:

<<<False>>>
