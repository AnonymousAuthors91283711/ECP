theorem omnimath2693 :
  ∃! (N : ℕ), 400 < N ∧ N < 600 ∧ Odd N ∧ 5 ∣ N ∧ 11 ∣ N ∧
  (digits 10 N).sum = omnimath2693_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 18
Proposed Answer: 555
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a unique natural number N between 400 and 600 that is:
   - Odd
   - Divisible by both 5 and 11
   - Has digit sum equal to some value (omnimath2693_answer)

2. Ground truth says the digit sum should be 18
3. Proposed answer suggests N = 555

Checking 555:
- 400 < 555 < 600: True
- Odd: True (555 is odd)
- Divisible by 5: True (ends with 5)
- Divisible by 11: 555 ÷ 11 ≈ 50.45 → Not divisible
- Digit sum: 5+5+5 = 15 ≠ 18

The proposed answer fails on two counts:
1. It's not divisible by 11
2. Its digit sum is 15, not 18

The correct number satisfying all conditions would be 495 (400 < 495 < 600, odd, divisible by 5 and 11, digit sum 4+9+5=18).
