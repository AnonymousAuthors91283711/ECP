Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for which prime p (given another prime q) there exist squares a² and b² such that:
   - p + q = a²
   - p + 7q = b²

2. The ground truth answer is p=2. Let's verify this:
   - If p=2, then we have:
     - 2 + q = a²
     - 2 + 7q = b²
   - The smallest prime q where both expressions are squares is q=7:
     - 2+7=9=3²
     - 2+7*7=51 which isn't a square
   - Next q=23:
     - 2+23=25=5²
     - 2+7*23=163 which isn't a square
   - q=2:
     - 2+2=4=2²
     - 2+7*2=16=4² → This works!

3. The proposed answer is p=4, but 4 isn't even a prime number, so it can't be correct.

The proposed answer fails both mathematically (4 isn't prime) and logically (the correct answer is 2).
