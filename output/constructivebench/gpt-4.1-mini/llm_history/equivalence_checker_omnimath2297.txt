  Continuous f ∧ (∀ x y : ℝ, x - y ∈ (algebraMap ℚ ℝ).range → f x - f y ∈ (algebraMap ℚ ℝ).range) ↔ f ∈ omnimath2297_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ (a : ℚ) (b : ℝ), f = fun x => (a : ℝ) * x + b}
Proposed Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ (r : ℝ) (q : ℚ), f = fun x => r * x + ↑q}
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. Ground truth answer: All functions of the form f(x) = a*x + b where a is rational and b is real.
2. Proposed answer: All functions of the form f(x) = r*x + q where r is real and q is rational.

The key difference is in the coefficients:
- In ground truth, the slope (a) must be rational and the intercept (b) can be any real number.
- In proposed answer, the slope (r) can be any real number but the intercept (q) must be rational.

These are not equivalent:
- Ground truth allows irrational intercepts but requires rational slopes.
- Proposed answer allows irrational slopes but requires rational intercepts.

For example:
- f(x) = π*x + 1 is in proposed answer but not ground truth.
- f(x) = 1*x + π is in ground truth but not proposed answer.
