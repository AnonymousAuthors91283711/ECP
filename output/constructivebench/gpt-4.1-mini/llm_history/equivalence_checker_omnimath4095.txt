Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n / 2 + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n => n - 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

The problem is about finding the smallest degree k such that every n-vertex regular graph with degree k must contain a triangle (3 vertices all adjacent to each other). This is a classic graph theory problem related to Turán-type theorems.

Ground Truth Answer: n/2 + 1
- This is correct for the triangle problem. It's known that for any n-vertex graph, if the minimum degree is > n/2, then it must contain a triangle (this follows from Dirac's theorem and other results in extremal graph theory).

Proposed Answer: n - 2
- This is incorrect. For example:
  - When n=4: ground truth gives 3, proposed gives 2. But a 4-vertex 2-regular graph (cycle) doesn't contain a triangle.
  - When n=5: ground truth gives 3.5 (so k=4), proposed gives 3. But a 5-vertex 3-regular graph (pentagon with chords) doesn't contain a triangle.
  
The proposed answer is too low - it would allow regular graphs without triangles when n ≥ 4.
