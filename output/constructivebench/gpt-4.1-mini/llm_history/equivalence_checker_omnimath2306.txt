Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 5^n
Proposed Answer: fun n => 6 * 3^(n - 1)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

The ground truth answer is 5^n, while the proposed answer is 6 * 3^(n-1).

Let's test for small values of n:
- For n=1: 
  - 5^1 = 5
  - 6*3^(0) = 6*1 = 6
  These are not equal (5 ≠ 6)

- For n=2:
  - 5^2 = 25
  - 6*3^1 = 18
  These are not equal (25 ≠ 18)

- For n=3:
  - 5^3 = 125
  - 6*3^2 = 54
  These are not equal (125 ≠ 54)

The two functions clearly produce different results for all n ≥ 1, and their growth rates are different (exponential with base 5 vs exponential with base 3).
