The error is because division and real number operations in Lean's mathlib can require noncomputable definitions since real numbers are defined axiomatically and not computable. You can fix this by marking the abbreviation as `noncomputable` so Lean knows to accept it without requiring executable code.

Since the problem involves ratios and time, and the enumerated answer hints (25/36) look correct, we keep that answer but just make it noncomputable.

The error happens because Lean requires `noncomputable` keyword for definitions involving noncomputable operations like division on Reals.

Your answer 25 / 36 is correct considering the problem context (you showed it in bike_time * 60), but you need to mark the abbreviation as `noncomputable` to let Lean accept it.

Thus, the fixed answer is:

The problem expects P2013AIMEI_1_answer as a real number constant (not a definition with `noncomputable def`), so declaring it as `abbrev` or `def` is fine, but we cannot use `noncomputable def` inside the expression for `abbrev`.

Since the given answer is `25/36`, which matches the units for bike_time * 60 (minutes), we can just provide:

<<<25 / 36>>> 

Explanation: The problem statement and the enumerated answer suggest the bike_time multiplied by 60 equals 25/36. Lean expects a term here, so simply writing `25 / 36` works fine as a closed form real number. The actual proof would set up swim_speed, run_speed, and bike_speed relations, then solve for bike_time * 60, yielding the answer 25/36.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error is because Lean requires definitions involving division on reals to be marked as noncomputable or use the "noncomputable" keyword for definitions depending on nonconstructive operations like division of real numbers.

You can fix this by marking your answer as noncomputable:

<<<noncomputable def P2013AIMEI_1_answer : ℝ := 25 / 36>>>
