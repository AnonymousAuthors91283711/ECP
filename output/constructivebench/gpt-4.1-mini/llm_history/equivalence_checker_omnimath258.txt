  IsLeast {N : ℕ | ∃ (s : Finset ℕ), 
    s.card = 2 * k + 1 ∧

Ground Truth Answer: fun k => 2 * k^3 + 3 * k^2 + 3 * k
Proposed Answer: fun k => 3 * k * (k + 1) / 2
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: 2*k³ + 3*k² + 3*k
2. Proposed: 3*k*(k+1)/2

Let's expand the proposed answer:
3*k*(k+1)/2 = (3k² + 3k)/2 = 1.5k² + 1.5k

Comparing with the ground truth:
- The ground truth has a cubic term (2k³) while the proposed answer only goes up to quadratic
- For k=1:
  - Ground truth: 2+3+3 = 8
  - Proposed: 3*1*2/2 = 3
- For k=2:
  - Ground truth: 16+12+6 = 34
  - Proposed: 3*2*3/2 = 9

The values are completely different and the proposed answer is missing the dominant cubic term. The forms are not equivalent.
