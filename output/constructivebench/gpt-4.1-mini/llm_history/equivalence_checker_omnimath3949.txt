Ground Truth Answer: 2 / Real.sqrt 5
Proposed Answer: Real.sqrt (3 / 10) + Real.sqrt (2 / 15)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimum value of a certain expression under given constraints (P).

2. The ground truth answer is 2/√5 ≈ 0.894427

3. The proposed answer is √(3/10) + √(2/15) ≈ 0.547723 + 0.365148 ≈ 0.912871

The two answers give different numerical values (0.894427 vs 0.912871), so they cannot be equivalent.
