Explanation: The problem asks for the greatest value d of sInf (range f) - sInf (range g) where f(x)=a(x-b)(x-c) and g(x)=a(x-b)(x+c) with distinct a,b,c in 1..11. The minimal values of these quadratic forms with roots at the specified integers and positive leading coefficient suggest that the difference in sInf values is bounded above by 1, which is achievable, making 1 the greatest.
