abbrev omnimath1986_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath1986 :
  (2016! ^ 2 / (2015! * 2017!) = omnimath1986_answer) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2016 / 2017
Proposed Answer: 1 / 2017
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is evaluating the expression (2016!²)/(2015! * 2017!)

2. Let's simplify the expression:
   - 2016!² = 2016! * 2016!
   - 2015! * 2017! = 2015! * 2017 * 2016! = 2017 * 2016! * 2015!
   - So the expression becomes: (2016! * 2016!)/(2017 * 2016! * 2015!) = 2016!/(2017 * 2015!)
   - 2016! = 2016 * 2015!, so this simplifies to (2016 * 2015!)/(2017 * 2015!) = 2016/2017

3. The ground truth answer is 2016/2017, which matches our simplification.

4. The proposed answer is 1/2017, which is incorrect as it's missing the 2016 numerator.
