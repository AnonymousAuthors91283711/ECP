Ground Truth Answer: 24
Proposed Answer: 18
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have two natural numbers r and b with:
   - r = b + 6 (from h1)
   - r/b = 5/3 (from h2)

2. Substituting h1 into h2:
   (b + 6)/b = 5/3

3. Solving for b:
   3(b + 6) = 5b
   3b + 18 = 5b
   18 = 2b
   b = 9

4. Then r = b + 6 = 15

5. Therefore r + b = 15 + 9 = 24

The ground truth answer is 24, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 18, which is incorrect.
