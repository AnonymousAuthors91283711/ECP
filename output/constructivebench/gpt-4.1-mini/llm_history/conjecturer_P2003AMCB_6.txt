The identifier `r` is not in scope in the definition of `P2003AMCB_6_answer` since it is a standalone constant. To fix this, `P2003AMCB_6_answer` must not depend on `r` directly, or it must be defined as a function depending on `r`. But since the problem is to find an expression for `a` in real numbers (independent of any variables outside the theorem), and the conditions are:

a * r = 2  
a * r^3 = 6

From these, dividing the second by the first:

(a r^3) / (a r) = 6 / 2  
r^2 = 3  
Thus r = ± sqrt 3 (with r ≠ 0)

Then from a r = 2, a = 2 / r = 2 / (±sqrt 3) = ± 2 * sqrt 3 / 3.

So `a` is either `2 * sqrt 3 / 3` or `- 2 * sqrt 3 / 3`.

Given the problem states the solution includes `a = 2 * sqrt 3 / 3` as one option, the other root corresponds to the negative value.

Therefore the two solutions for `a` are ± 2 * sqrt 3 / 3.

Hence the answer should be the set `{2 * sqrt 3 / 3, - 2 * sqrt 3 / 3}`, which can be expressed as:

`2 * sqrt 3 / 3` or `- 2 * sqrt 3 / 3`

Since the theorem states the answer as `a = P2003AMCB_6_answer ∨ a = 2 * sqrt 3 / 3`, the candidate `P2003AMCB_6_answer` must be the other root, i.e., `- 2 * sqrt 3 / 3`.

Therefore, the proper closed form in Lean should be:

`- 2 * sqrt 3 / 3`

Enclosing the answer expression:

<<<- 2 * sqrt 3 / 3>>>
