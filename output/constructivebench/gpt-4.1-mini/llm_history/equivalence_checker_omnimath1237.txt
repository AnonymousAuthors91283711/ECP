Ground Truth Answer: 20
Proposed Answer: 3 * 16 - 7 * 7
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a system of equations involving weighted sums of powers of x and y, and asks for the value of a*x^5 + b*y^5.

2. The ground truth answer is 20.

3. The proposed answer is 3*16 - 7*7 = 48 - 49 = -1.

4. The correct answer should indeed be 20. There's a known recurrence relation for such problems:
   If we let S_n = a*x^n + b*y^n, then S_{n+1} = (x+y)*S_n - xy*S_{n-1}.

5. Calculating step-by-step:
   - From S_1=3 and S_2=7, we can find x+y and xy
   - Then use these to compute S_3, S_4, and finally S_5
   - The correct computation leads to S_5=20

6. The proposed answer (3*16 - 7*7) doesn't match the correct recurrence pattern and gives -1 instead of 20.
