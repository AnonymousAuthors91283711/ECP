  F n = P2009AMCA_11_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 2 * n^2 - 2 * n + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 2 * n + 1 + 2 * (n - 2) * (n + 1)
Let's analyze the two expressions:

Ground truth: 2n² - 2n + 1
Proposed: 2n + 1 + 2(n-2)(n+1)

Let's simplify the proposed answer:
2n + 1 + 2(n-2)(n+1)
= 2n + 1 + 2(n² - n - 2)
= 2n + 1 + 2n² - 2n - 4
= 2n² - 3

Now compare with ground truth:
2n² - 2n + 1 vs 2n² - 3

These are clearly different expressions (-2n+1 ≠ -3 for most n), so the answers are not equivalent.
