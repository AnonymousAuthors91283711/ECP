Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: (0.1 * 70 + 0.25 * 80 + 0.2 * 85 + 0.15 * 90 + 0.3 * 95) - 85
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer correctly calculates the weighted mean by multiplying each score by its corresponding weight and summing them up, then subtracts the median (85). When computed, this gives exactly 1, which matches the ground truth answer. The expressions are equivalent.
