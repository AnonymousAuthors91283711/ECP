: sInf {Real.sqrt (58 - 42 * x) + Real.sqrt (149 - 140 * Real.sqrt (1 - x ^ 2)) | x ∈ Icc (-1) 1} = omnimath2116_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<Real.sqrt 17>>> 

Explanation: At boundary points x = ±1 inside Icc(-1,1), expressions simplify, and minimum value is Real.sqrt 17 by evaluating the expression at these.
