theorem P2014AMCA_7 : 
  ∃ (r : ℝ), (√3) * r = 3^(1/3) ∧ (3^(1/3)) * r = 3^(1/6) ∧ (3^(1/6)) * r = P2014AMCA_7_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: (3: ℝ)^(1/6)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a real number r that satisfies three equations simultaneously:
   - √3 * r = 3^(1/3)
   - 3^(1/3) * r = 3^(1/6)
   - 3^(1/6) * r = P2014AMCA_7_answer

2. From the first equation: r = 3^(1/3)/√3 = 3^(1/3)/3^(1/2) = 3^(1/3 - 1/2) = 3^(-1/6)

3. From the second equation: r = 3^(1/6)/3^(1/3) = 3^(1/6 - 1/3) = 3^(-1/6) (consistent)

4. From the third equation: P2014AMCA_7_answer = 3^(1/6) * r = 3^(1/6) * 3^(-1/6) = 3^0 = 1

The ground truth answer is 1, while the proposed answer is 3^(1/6). These are clearly different values (3^(1/6) ≈ 1.2 ≠ 1).
