  let T := 7/8
  let m := 7

Ground Truth Answer: -8
Proposed Answer: -(7:ℚ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a quadratic equation: x² + (7+8)x + 7*8 = 0 → x² + 15x + 56 = 0
2. The roots of this equation are x = [-15 ± √(225-224)]/2 → x = [-15 ± 1]/2
3. This gives two roots: x = -7 and x = -8
4. The problem asks for the least element in the roots set excluding {-8}, which leaves only {-7}
5. The ground truth answer is -8, but this contradicts the problem statement since -8 is excluded
6. The proposed answer is -7, which is correct as it's the only remaining root

The ground truth answer appears to be incorrect based on the problem statement, while the proposed answer is correct. However, there might be a misunderstanding in interpreting the problem statement.
