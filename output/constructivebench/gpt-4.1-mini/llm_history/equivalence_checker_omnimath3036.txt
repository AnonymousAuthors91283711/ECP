Ground Truth Answer: 17
Proposed Answer: 6 + 9 + 9 + 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the sum K + L + M + N given a specific equation involving these variables (all single-digit numbers from 0-9).

2. The equation simplifies to:
6000 + 100K + L - (1000M + 900 + 10N + 4) = 2011
Which further simplifies to:
100K + L - 1000M - 10N = 2011 - 6000 + 904
100K + L - 1000M - 10N = -2085

3. Rearranging:
1000M - 100K + 10N - L = 2085

4. Looking at the digits:
- The term 1000M must be between 0 and 9000 (since M ∈ 0..9)
- The equation suggests M must be 2 (since 2000 ≤ 2085 < 3000)
- Then we have: 2000 - 100K + 10N - L = 2085 → -100K + 10N - L = 85

5. Solving further:
- K must be 0 (since if K≥1, the left side would be ≤ -100 + 90 - 0 = -10 < 85)
- Then: 10N - L = 85 → This requires N=9 and L=5 (since 10*9 -5 = 85)

6. Therefore:
K=0, L=5, M=2, N=9
Sum: 0 + 5 + 2 + 9 = 16

Wait, this contradicts both answers. Let me re-examine the simplification:

Original equation:
6000 + 100K + L - (1000M + 900 + 10N + 4) = 2011
Simplifies to:
6000 + 100K + L - 1000M - 900 - 10N - 4 = 2011
5100 + 100K + L - 1000M - 10N = 2011
100K + L - 1000M - 10N = -3089
1000M - 100K - 10N + L = 3089

Now M must be 3:
3000 - 100K - 10N + L = 3089
-100K - 10N + L = 89

This is impossible since maximum value when K=N=0, L=9 is 9 < 89.

I must have made an error in the initial simplification. Let's try again:

6000 + 100K + L - (1000M + 900 + 10N + 4) = 2011
6000 + 100K + L - 1000M - 900 - 10N - 4 = 2011
5096 + 100K + L - 1000M - 10N = 2011
100K + L - 1000M - 10N = -3085
1000M - 100K - 10N + L = 3085

M must be 3:
3000 - 100K - 10N + L = 3085
-100K - 10N + L = 85

This is only possible if K=0, N=1, L=95 - but L must be <10. Thus no solution.

This suggests there might be an error in the problem statement or answers. Given the ground truth is 17 and proposed is 31 (6+9+9+7), and neither matches our analysis, but the ground truth is closer to our initial calculation (16 vs 17).

Given the confusion, I'll go with:

<<<False>>>
