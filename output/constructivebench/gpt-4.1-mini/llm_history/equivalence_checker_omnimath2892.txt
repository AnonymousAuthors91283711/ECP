Ground Truth Answer: -1/4
Proposed Answer: - (2 + 3 + 4) / 36
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us:
   - b1 = 2, b2 = 3, b3 = 4
   - x1 = -b1/m, x2 = -b2/m, x3 = -b3/m
   - x1 + x2 + x3 = 36

2. Substituting the values:
   (-2/m) + (-3/m) + (-4/m) = 36
   => (-2 -3 -4)/m = 36
   => -9/m = 36

3. Solving for m:
   m = -9/36 = -1/4

The ground truth answer is indeed -1/4.

The proposed answer is - (2 + 3 + 4) / 36 = -9/36 = -1/4.

Both answers are mathematically equivalent.
