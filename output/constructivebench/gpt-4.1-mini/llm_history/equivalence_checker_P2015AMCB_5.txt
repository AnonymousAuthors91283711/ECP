  IsLeast {N : ℕ | 0 < N ∧ 19 * (3 + N) ≤ 20 * (1 + N)} P2015AMCB_5_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 37
Proposed Answer: 20
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number N that satisfies:
   0 < N ∧ 19 * (3 + N) ≤ 20 * (1 + N)

2. Let's solve the inequality:
   19*(3 + N) ≤ 20*(1 + N)
   57 + 19N ≤ 20 + 20N
   57 - 20 ≤ 20N - 19N
   37 ≤ N

3. Therefore, the smallest natural number N satisfying the inequality is 37 (the ground truth answer).

4. The proposed answer is 20, which doesn't satisfy the inequality:
   19*(3+20) = 437
   20*(1+20) = 420
   437 ≤ 420 is false.

The proposed answer is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
