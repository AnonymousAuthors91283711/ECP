Ground Truth Answer: 211
Proposed Answer: 337
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us:
   - p is a prime between 100 and 500
   - e = 2016 mod (p-1)
   - e - (1/2*(p-1)) = 21

2. For the ground truth answer p=211:
   - p-1 = 210
   - 2016 mod 210 = 126 (since 210*9=1890, 2016-1890=126)
   - e = 126
   - 126 - (210/2) = 126 - 105 = 21 (matches the condition)

3. For the proposed answer p=337:
   - p-1 = 336
   - 2016 mod 336 = 0 (since 336*6=2016)
   - e = 0
   - 0 - (336/2) = -168 ≠ 21 (doesn't match)

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the given conditions, while the ground truth does.

<<<False>>>
