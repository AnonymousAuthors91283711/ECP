Ground Truth Answer: 36
Proposed Answer: 6
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a set S of natural numbers p that can be expressed as 2*(a+b) where a and b are positive integers with a*b=24.

2. We need to find a number that:
   - Is not in S (omnimath3437_answer ∉ S)
   - Is the only natural number not in S (∀ p : ℕ, p ∉ S → p = omnimath3437_answer)

3. First, let's find all possible (a,b) pairs where a*b=24 and a,b>0:
   (1,24), (2,12), (3,8), (4,6), (6,4), (8,3), (12,2), (24,1)

4. Calculating p=2*(a+b) for each:
   50, 28, 22, 20, 20, 22, 28, 50

5. The set S is {20, 22, 28, 50}

6. The smallest natural number not in S is 1, but the problem implies there's exactly one number not in S, which must be larger than all elements in S. This suggests we're looking for numbers above 50.

7. The ground truth answer is 36, which is indeed not in S, but there are many numbers not in S (all numbers except 20,22,28,50), so this doesn't satisfy the uniqueness condition.

8. The proposed answer is 6, which is also not in S, but again fails the uniqueness condition and is smaller than elements in S.

Both answers fail to satisfy the uniqueness condition, but they fail in different ways. The ground truth answer at least points to a number larger than all elements in S, while the proposed answer points to a number smaller than all elements in S.
