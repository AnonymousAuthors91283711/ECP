noncomputable abbrev P2013AMCA_4_answer : ‚Ñù := sorry
theorem P2013AMCA_4 :
  (2 ^ 2014 + 2 ^ 2012) / (2 ^ 2014 - 2 ^ 2012) = P2013AMCA_4_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 5 / 3
Proposed Answer: (2^2012 + 1) / (2^2012 - 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is to simplify the expression (2^2014 + 2^2012)/(2^2014 - 2^2012)

2. Ground truth answer is 5/3

3. Proposed answer is (2^2012 + 1)/(2^2012 - 1)

Let's simplify the original expression:
(2^2014 + 2^2012)/(2^2014 - 2^2012) 
= [2^2012(2^2 + 1)]/[2^2012(2^2 - 1)] 
= (4 + 1)/(4 - 1) 
= 5/3

The proposed answer (2^2012 + 1)/(2^2012 - 1) is incorrect because:
- It doesn't simplify to 5/3
- The exponents weren't properly factored out
- The final form still contains exponents when it shouldn't

<<<False>>>
