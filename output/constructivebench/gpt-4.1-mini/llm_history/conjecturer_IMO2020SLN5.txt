theorem IMO2020SLN5 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∃ n, f n ≠ 0) ∧
  (∀ x y, f (x * y) = f x + f y) ∧
  (Set.Infinite {n : ℕ | ∀ k < n, f k = f (n - k)}) ↔
  ∃ p c, Prime p ∧ c ≠ 0 ∧ f = IMO2020SLN5_answer p c := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun p c n => c * (n / p)>>>
Explanation: Since f is multiplicative and symmetric around n/2 infinitely often, f must be linear on multiples of a prime p, so f n = c * (n / p) for prime p and c ≠ 0.
