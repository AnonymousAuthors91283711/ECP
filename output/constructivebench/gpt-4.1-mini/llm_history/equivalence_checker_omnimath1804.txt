Ground Truth Answer: 3970
Proposed Answer: 2^(6 + 6)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting the number of 6×6 binary matrices that can be expressed as an outer product of two binary vectors (one for rows, one for columns).

2. The ground truth answer is 3970, which is the exact count of such matrices.

3. The proposed answer is 2^(6+6) = 4096, which counts all possible combinations of row and column vectors (2^6 for rows × 2^6 for columns = 4096).

However, this overcounts because:
- The all-zero matrix can be formed by 63 different pairs of vectors (any zero row vector with any column vector, or any row vector with zero column vector)
- Similarly, other matrices have multiple representations

The exact count is indeed 3970, as it accounts for these duplicates. Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
