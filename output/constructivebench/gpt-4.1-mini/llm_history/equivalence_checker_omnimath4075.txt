Ground Truth Answer: fun n p => ∃ k, n = k * p^2
Proposed Answer: fun n p => p ∣ n
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about partitioning numbers from 0 to n-1 into p boxes (where p is prime) with:
   - Disjoint boxes
   - Union covers all numbers
   - Each box has equal sum

2. The ground truth answer states that n must be of the form k*p² for some k.

3. The proposed answer states that p must divide n.

Comparison:
- The ground truth is more restrictive (n must be divisible by p²)
- The proposed answer is less restrictive (n must be divisible by p)
- For example:
  - When n=4 and p=2:
    - Ground truth: 4 = 1*2² → True
    - Proposed: 2 divides 4 → True
  - When n=6 and p=2:
    - Ground truth: 6 ≠ k*4 → False
    - Proposed: 2 divides 6 → True
  - When n=9 and p=3:
    - Ground truth: 9 = 1*3² → True
    - Proposed: 3 divides 9 → True

The proposed answer is incorrect because it allows cases where n is divisible by p but not by p², which don't satisfy the original condition.
