theorem omnimath2256 :
  let n := 21
  let alice := 11
  let expectedGames := (∑ k in Finset.range (alice - 1), 1/(k + 1 : ℚ)) + (∑ k in Finset.range (n - alice), 1/(k + 1 : ℚ))

Ground Truth Answer: 47/42
Proposed Answer: (∑ k in Finset.range 10, 1 / (k + 1 : ℚ)) + (∑ k in Finset.range 10, 1 / (k + 1 : ℚ))
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

1. The problem defines:
   - n = 21
   - alice = 11
   - expectedGames formula with two sums:
     * First sum: range (alice-1) = range 10 → terms 1/1 to 1/10
     * Second sum: range (n-alice) = range 10 → terms 1/1 to 1/10

2. Ground truth answer is 47/42, which is the correct sum of:
   - First sum (harmonic series H_10) = 7381/2520
   - Second sum (same H_10) = 7381/2520
   - Total = 14762/2520 = 7381/1260 ≈ 5.858, not 47/42 ≈ 1.119

3. Proposed answer is exactly the same as the formula in the theorem statement, just written out with the concrete values.

The ground truth answer appears to be incorrect for the given problem setup, while the proposed answer correctly represents the mathematical expression from the theorem statement. However, neither matches the claimed ground truth value of 47/42.
