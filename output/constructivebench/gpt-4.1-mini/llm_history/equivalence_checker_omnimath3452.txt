noncomputable abbrev omnimath3452_answer : Fin 3 → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3452 :
  (∀ i : Fin 3, omnimath3452_answer i < omnimath3452_answer (i + 1)) ∧
  (∀ x : ℝ, (x = Real.sqrt 2011 ∨ x = 2011 ∨ x = 2011 ^ 2) → (∃! i : Fin 3, x = omnimath3452_answer i)) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun i => if i = 0 then Real.sqrt 2011 else 2011 ^ (i : ℕ)
Proposed Answer: fun i : Fin 3 => 
  if h : i = 0 then Real.sqrt 2011
  else if h : i = 1 then 2011
  else 2011 ^ 2
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both define a function that maps:
- i=0 to Real.sqrt 2011
- i=1 to 2011
- i=2 to 2011^2

The ground truth uses a more compact form with exponentiation, while the proposed answer uses explicit cases, but they produce identical outputs for all inputs in Fin 3. The conditions in both answers ensure the same strict ordering (sqrt(2011) < 2011 < 2011^2 and unique mapping for each specified x value.
