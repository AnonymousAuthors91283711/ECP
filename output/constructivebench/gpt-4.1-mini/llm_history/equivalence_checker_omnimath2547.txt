Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 10
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence where:
   - a(1) = 1
   - For n > 1, a(n) = (a(n-1))! + 1

2. We need to find the smallest n such that a(n) > 10^10.

3. Let's compute the sequence:
   - a(1) = 1
   - a(2) = 1! + 1 = 2
   - a(3) = 2! + 1 = 3
   - a(4) = 3! + 1 = 7
   - a(5) = 7! + 1 = 5041
   - a(6) = 5041! + 1 (which is clearly > 10^10)

4. The ground truth answer is 6, which is correct since a(6) is the first term exceeding 10^10.

5. The proposed answer is 10, which is incorrect as we've shown the correct answer is 6.
