The given problem defines a set omnimath3829_answer of integers x that are positive and coprime to every value of the sequence a n := 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1 for n ≥ 1. We want to characterize this set precisely.

**Reasoning**:

- The sequence a n = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1.
- Let’s test small cases:
  - a 1 = 2 + 3 + 6 - 1 = 10
  - a 2 = 4 + 9 + 36 - 1 = 48
  - gcd(10, 48) = 2; 2 divides both, so any x coprime with both cannot be divisible by 2.
  - a 3 = 8 + 27 + 216 - 1 = 250
  - gcd(10, 250) = 10 = 2*5, so 5 divides some a n.
  - Check if 3 divides a n:
    - a 1 mod 3 = (2 + 3 + 6 - 1) mod 3 = (2 + 0 + 0 - 1) = 1 mod 3 ≠ 0
    - a 2 mod 3 = (4 + 9 + 36 - 1) mod 3 = (1 + 0 + 0 - 1) = 0 mod 3

So 3 divides some a n.

Testing shows 2,3,5 divide some of the a n.

If the problem was about coprimality with all these numbers, x must not be divisible by any of these primes.

Interestingly, since 1 is coprime to all integers, and every prime dividing some a n excludes x= their multiples, the positive x coprime with all a n is just 1.

So the only x positive which does not share any prime factor with any a n for all n ≥ 1 is 1.

Hence the set of such x is {1}.

**In Lean:**

We want to define the set of integers x such that x > 0 and for all n ≥ 1, gcd (x, a n) = 1.

The set is {1}.

We must express this in Lean as `{1}` but in Lean, sets over ℤ can be written as `{x : ℤ | x = 1}`, or simply `Set.singleton 1` or `{1}`.

If there's an error using `{x | x ∈ {1}}`, it is probably due to the bad definition of membership. Simply define the set as `{1}` or `Set.singleton 1`, which is the standard way.

**Final Lean expression:**

```lean
{1}
```

or equivalently

```lean
Set.singleton (1 : ℤ)
```

Either works as a closed form set describing the answer.
