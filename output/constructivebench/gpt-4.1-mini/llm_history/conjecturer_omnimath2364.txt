The error comes from attempting to use the variable `θ` inside the set definition `omnimath2364_answer`, which is of type `Set ℝ` and thus cannot depend on a parameter not in scope. To avoid this, note that the problem statement expresses uniqueness of the root `r` of a quadratic equation in `r` parameterized by `θ`, and the answer set characterizes when there is exactly one solution for `r` for fixed `θ`. So the set should be defined solely as a subset of `ℝ` independent of `θ`. Instead, `omnimath2364_answer` should be a set of all real numbers that `sin θ` can be so that there is a unique solution.

From the problem:

Given the quadratic in `r`:

(sin θ) * r² + (cos θ + tan θ) * r + 1 = 0,

which has a unique solution if and only if its discriminant equals zero:

Δ = (cos θ + tan θ)² - 4 * sin θ * 1 = 0.

Rewrite the problem to find the condition on `sin θ`.

Hence, the answer set can be defined as the set of `x` corresponding to `sin θ` that make the discriminant zero, i.e.

{ x : ℝ | ∃ θ, x = sin θ ∧ (cos θ + tan θ)² = 4 * x }.

However, since the theorem states an equivalence between uniqueness of solution and `sin θ ∈ omnimath2364_answer`, `omnimath2364_answer` must be a subset of `ℝ` defined purely in terms of `sin θ` without `θ` inside.

Thus, defining it as the set of all `x : ℝ` such that there exists `θ` with `sin θ = x` and discriminant zero is suitable.

Expressed without `θ`, it is tricky since `cos θ` and `tan θ` depend on `θ`. Using the Pythagorean identity and the definition of `tan θ = sin θ / cos θ`, one can rewrite the discriminant in terms of `sin θ` and `cos θ`, then `cos θ = ±√(1 - sin² θ)`. This naturally leads to a set defined as

{ x | ∃ c : ℝ, c = cos θ, c² = 1 - x² ∧ (c + x / c)² = 4x }.

Putting it all together, one can define

omnimath2364_answer := { x : ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, c^2 = 1 - x^2 ∧ (c + x / c)^2 = 4 * x }.

This definition depends only on `x` with an existential over `c` and can be used independently of `θ`.

Hence, to fix the error, do not define the set using `θ` but in terms of `sin θ = x` and `cos θ = c`.

In Lean, this becomes:

{ x : ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, c^2 = 1 - x^2 ∧ (c + x / c)^2 = 4 * x }.

This is closed form and formalizable.
