Ground Truth Answer: 2017 / 1008
Proposed Answer: 1/2 + 1/2017
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about summing the reciprocals of all natural numbers whose only prime divisors are 2 and 2017.

2. The ground truth answer is 2017/1008.

3. The proposed answer is 1/2 + 1/2017.

Analysis:
- The numbers in set S are all numbers of the form 2^a * 2017^b where a,b ≥ 0 (but not both zero).
- The sum of reciprocals would be (1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + ...) * (1 + 1/2017 + 1/2017² + ...) - 1
- This equals (1/(1-1/2)) * (1/(1-1/2017)) - 1 = 2 * (2017/2016) - 1 = 2017/1008 - 1 = 1009/1008
- Wait, this seems incorrect. Let me re-examine:
Actually, the correct sum is (1/(1-1/2)) * (1/(1-1/2017)) - 1 = 2 * (2017/2016) - 1 = 2017/1008 - 1008/1008 = 1009/1008

But the ground truth says 2017/1008, which would be the sum including 1 (the case when a=b=0), but the problem states s > 0, so 1 shouldn't be included.

The proposed answer 1/2 + 1/2017 is just the sum of the first two terms (a=1,b=0 and a=0,b=1), missing all higher powers and combinations.

Conclusion:
The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't account for all terms in the series. The ground truth appears to include the term for 1 which shouldn't be there based on the problem statement.
