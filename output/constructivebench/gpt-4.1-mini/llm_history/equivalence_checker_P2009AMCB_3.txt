abbrev P2009AMCB_3_answer : ‚Ñù := sorry
theorem P2009AMCB_3 : 
  0.8 * 60 = (4/3) * P2009AMCB_3_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 36
Proposed Answer: 48
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation given is: 0.8 * 60 = (4/3) * x
2. Calculating left side: 0.8 * 60 = 48
3. So the equation becomes: 48 = (4/3) * x
4. Solving for x: x = 48 * (3/4) = 36

The ground truth answer correctly solves for x = 36, while the proposed answer gives 48, which is actually the left side of the equation before solving for x.
