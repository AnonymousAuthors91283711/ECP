Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 5
Proposed Answer: fun x => 10
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us:
   - x > 0
   - logₐ₂(x) = 20 (logarithm of x with base √2 equals 20)

2. We need to find log₂(√x)

3. Let's solve it step by step:
   - From logₐ₂(x) = 20, we can write x = (√2)²⁰
   - √x = √((√2)²⁰) = (√2)¹⁰ = (2^(1/2))¹⁰ = 2⁵
   - Now log₂(√x) = log₂(2⁵) = 5

The ground truth answer is correct (5), while the proposed answer is incorrect (10).
