Ground Truth Answer: {-2, -1, 1, 2}
Proposed Answer: {k : ℤ | k ≠ 0 ∧ 36 - 4 * k * k > 0}
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all non-zero integer values of k where the quadratic equation kx² + 6x + k = 0 has two distinct real roots (x1 ≠ x2).

2. For a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 to have two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be positive: b² - 4ac > 0.

3. Applying this to our equation:
   - a = k
   - b = 6
   - c = k
   So discriminant condition is: 6² - 4*k*k > 0 → 36 - 4k² > 0 → 9 - k² > 0 → k² < 9

4. The ground truth answer {-2, -1, 1, 2} lists all non-zero integers where k² < 9.

5. The proposed answer {k : ℤ | k ≠ 0 ∧ 36 - 4 * k * k > 0} is exactly the set of non-zero integers satisfying the discriminant condition we derived.

6. While the forms are different (one is explicit enumeration, the other is a condition), they describe exactly the same set of integers.
