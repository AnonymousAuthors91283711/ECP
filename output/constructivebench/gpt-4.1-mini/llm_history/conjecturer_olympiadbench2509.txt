The errors come from incorrect usage of `let` inside an abbrev definition in Lean. Instead, just directly write the tuple as `(a, b, c)` with the values substituted explicitly. Also, since a = 1/2 is positive and not equal to 1, b = 1, c = 6 satisfy the system by plugging into the given logarithmic equations, the closed form is simply `(1/2, 1, 6)`.
