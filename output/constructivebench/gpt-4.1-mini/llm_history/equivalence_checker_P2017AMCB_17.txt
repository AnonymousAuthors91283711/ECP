Ground Truth Answer: 2 / 81
Proposed Answer: (2 / 3) ^ 3 + (1 / 3) ^ 3 - 2 * (2 / 3) ^ 2 * (1 / 3) ^ 2
Let's evaluate the proposed answer step by step.

1. Given:
   - pA = (2/3)^3 + (1/3)^3
   - pB = 2*(2/3)^2*(1/3)^2

2. The proposed answer is pA - pB, which matches exactly what we need to compute.

3. Calculating pA:
   (2/3)^3 = 8/27
   (1/3)^3 = 1/27
   pA = 8/27 + 1/27 = 9/27 = 1/3

4. Calculating pB:
   (2/3)^2 = 4/9
   (1/3)^2 = 1/9
   pB = 2*(4/9)*(1/9) = 8/81

5. Calculating pA - pB:
   1/3 - 8/81 = 27/81 - 8/81 = 19/81

However, the ground truth answer is 2/81, which doesn't match our calculation (19/81). This suggests the proposed answer is the correct expression to evaluate, but when simplified it doesn't match the ground truth answer.
