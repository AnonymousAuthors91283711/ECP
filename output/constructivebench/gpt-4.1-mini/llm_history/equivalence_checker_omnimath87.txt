Ground Truth Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a : ℝ, a ≥ 0 ∧ ∀ x y : ℝ, f (x + y ^ 2) = f x + |y * f y|}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c ≥ 0, ∀ x, f x = c * x}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

The problem is asking for all real-valued functions f: ℝ → ℝ that satisfy the functional equation:
f(x + y²) = f(x) + |y * f(y)| for all x,y ∈ ℝ

Ground Truth Answer states that the solution set consists of all functions f where there exists a non-negative real number a (a ≥ 0) such that f satisfies the given functional equation.

Proposed Answer claims the solution set is all linear functions f(x) = c*x where c is a non-negative constant.

Key observations:
1. The ground truth doesn't specify the form of f, just that it satisfies the equation with some a ≥ 0
2. The proposed answer assumes a specific linear form
3. We can verify that f(x) = c*x satisfies the equation:
   f(x + y²) = c(x + y²) = cx + cy²
   f(x) + |y*f(y)| = cx + |y*cy| = cx + c|y²| = cx + cy² (since c ≥ 0 and y² ≥ 0)
   So these linear functions do satisfy the equation
4. However, the ground truth allows for potentially non-linear solutions that satisfy the equation

Conclusion: The proposed answer gives a subset of the actual solution set (only linear solutions), while the ground truth allows for all possible solutions. Therefore they are not equivalent.
