Ground Truth Answer: 240
Proposed Answer: 30 * 1
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem asks for the greatest product x*y where x and y are positive integers summing to 31 (x + y = 31).

2. The ground truth answer is 240, which comes from 15*16 (since 15+16=31). This is indeed the maximum product for numbers summing to 31.

3. The proposed answer is 30*1, which:
   - Does satisfy x+y=31 (30+1=31)
   - But gives a product of 30, which is much smaller than 240
   - Is clearly not the maximum product possible

The proposed answer fails to find the actual maximum product, instead giving one of the minimal possible products (since 30*1 = 1*30 is among the smallest products possible under these constraints).
