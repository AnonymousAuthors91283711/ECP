The equation is:
10^x * 100^{2x} = 1000^5

Rewrite the bases:
100 = 10^2
1000 = 10^3

So:
10^x * (10^2)^{2x} = (10^3)^5
10^x * 10^{4x} = 10^{15}
10^{5x} = 10^{15}

Then:
5x = 15 → x = 3

Your candidate 5/3 is incorrect; the correct answer is 3.

In Lean, defining a real value as a rational fraction can cause computability issues unless marked noncomputable. Here, since x = 3 is a simple integer, we can define it as 3 without problem.
