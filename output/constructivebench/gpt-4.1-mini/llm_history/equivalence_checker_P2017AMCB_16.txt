Ground Truth Answer: 1 / 19
Proposed Answer: 21 / 42
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the ratio of odd divisors of 21! to all divisors of 21!.

2. Key facts:
- For any number N with prime factorization p₁^a₁ * p₂^a₂ * ... * p_k^a_k, the number of divisors is (a₁+1)(a₂+1)...(a_k+1)
- For 21!, the prime 2 appears with exponent ⌊21/2⌋ + ⌊21/4⌋ + ... = 10+5+2+1 = 18
- All other primes (which are odd) appear with their respective exponents in 21!

3. Total number of divisors (factors.ncard):
- This would be (18+1) * (product of (exponents+1) for all other primes)
- Let's call the product of other terms P = (exponents+1 for all odd primes)

4. Number of odd divisors (S.ncard):
- This would be P (since we exclude the factor of 2^18)

5. Therefore, the ratio is P/(19*P) = 1/19

The proposed answer 21/42 simplifies to 1/2, which is incorrect. The correct answer is indeed 1/19.
