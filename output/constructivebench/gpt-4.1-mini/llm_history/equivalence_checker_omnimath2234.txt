Ground Truth Answer: 100
Proposed Answer: 46
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n where the minimal p-value for n+2 is less than the minimal p-value for n, under the given linear combinations.

2. The ground truth answer is 100, which suggests that n=100 is the smallest number where this condition holds.

3. The proposed answer is 46, which is significantly smaller than 100.

4. To verify, we'd need to check the minimal p-values for both n and n+2 around these numbers. For n=46, we'd need to confirm that P' < P, and that this doesn't hold for any smaller n.

5. Given the nature of these linear combinations (6a+10b and 7a+12b), it's unlikely that the condition would first occur at such a small number as 46. The coefficients suggest that the minimal p-values would decrease more gradually, making 100 a more plausible answer.

6. Without exact calculations, but based on the relative magnitudes and the ground truth being 100, I conclude the proposed answer is incorrect.
