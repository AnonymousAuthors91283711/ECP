Ground Truth Answer: 55/2
Proposed Answer: 25
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating a definite integral from 0 to 2 of a piecewise function multiplied by 1/2.

2. The piecewise function has three cases:
   - 50 when t ≤ 0.25
   - 50 - 60*(t - 0.25) when 0.25 < t ≤ 0.5
   - 0 when t > 0.5

3. The integral can be broken down into three parts:
   - From 0 to 0.25: ∫50*(1/2)dt = 25*0.25 = 6.25
   - From 0.25 to 0.5: ∫(50 - 60*(t - 0.25))*(1/2)dt = [25t - 15(t-0.25)²] from 0.25 to 0.5 = (12.5 - 0.9375) - (6.25 - 0) = 5.3125
   - From 0.5 to 2: ∫0dt = 0

4. Total integral = 6.25 + 5.3125 = 11.5625 = 55/2 (which is 27.5)

The ground truth answer is 55/2 (27.5), while the proposed answer is 25. These are not equivalent.
