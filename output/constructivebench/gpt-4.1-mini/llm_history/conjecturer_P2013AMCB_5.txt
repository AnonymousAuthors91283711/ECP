The problem arises because division in real numbers in Lean often involves noncomputable definitions (due to the use of irrationals or limits), and Lean requires the function to be marked as `noncomputable` to allow such definitions.

To fix the error, mark the abbreviation as `noncomputable` so Lean knows it may use noncomputable definitions to define the expression.

Thus, the corrected definition is:

The error arises because Lean requires definitions involving real number division to be marked as `noncomputable`, since real numbers are defined axiomatically and division is not computable in the constructive sense.

You can fix it by marking the definition as `noncomputable` or using `def` with the `noncomputable` keyword before the definition. This is standard when dealing with real number arithmetic in Lean.

The final corrected expression is simply the fraction as given:

The issue is that you tried to combine a `noncomputable def` declaration inside an `abbrev` definition, which is not valid syntax. `abbrev` is for abbreviation of a term, not definition of a function or noncomputable value. Since the expression is a simple rational number, and Lean can handle division with literals rations to produce a real number, you can define it simply as an abbreviation or a `def` without `noncomputable` keyword.

The closed form is simply the weighted average \(\frac{33*11 + 55*33}{33+55}\), which evaluates to a specific real number.

I propose the following final corrected Lean expression:

The error arises because Lean's real division is not computable by default, so when defining a constant with division on real numbers, Lean requests marking it as noncomputable. To fix the error, mark the abbrev as noncomputable.

Also, the expression is correct as is for the intended value.
