theorem omnimath3754 :
  {(n, p) : ℕ × ℕ | n > 0 ∧ p > 0 ∧ Nat.Prime p ∧ (∑ i ∈ Finset.Icc 1 n, i = 3 * ∑ j ∈ Finset.Icc 1 p, j ^ 2)} = omnimath3754_answer ↔ True := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(5, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(n, p) | n = 3 * p * (p + 1) / 2 ∧ Nat.Prime p}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for pairs (n,p) where:
   - n,p > 0
   - p is prime
   - Sum of first n natural numbers equals 3 times sum of squares of first p natural numbers

2. Ground truth gives exactly one solution: (5,2)
   - Sum of first 5 naturals: 1+2+3+4+5 = 15
   - Sum of squares of first 2 naturals: 1+4 = 5
   - 15 = 3*5 (correct)

3. Proposed answer suggests a general form: n = 3p(p+1)/2
   - For p=2: n=3*2*3/2=9, but ground truth shows n=5 works
   - The proposed form doesn't match the actual solution
   - It's missing the specific case that works (5,2)
   - The general form is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the original equation

<<<False>>>
