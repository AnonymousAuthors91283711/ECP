The error message suggests that F is not defined or not recognized as a function on ℕ, which is necessary to write ∑ n ∈ Finset.Icc 2 2007, F n. Without knowing the exact definition of F, we cannot directly fix the usage. Assuming F is some known function ℕ → ℕ and the problem states the sum from 2 to 2007 of F n equals the answer.

Since your candidate answer is 2007 * 2006, which looks like n*(n-1) evaluated at n=2007, a natural guess is that the sum of F n over n=2 to N is N*(N-1). This might correspond to something like F(n) = 2n - 2, summing to N(N-1), or some other function with that sum.

Without precise info on F, the best I can do is fix the answer part and close the answer as a natural number:
