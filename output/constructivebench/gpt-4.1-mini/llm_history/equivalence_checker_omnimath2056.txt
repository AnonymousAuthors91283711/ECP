Ground Truth Answer: 127
Proposed Answer: 512
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest 3-digit number (n = 100A + 10B + C where A,B,C are digits 1-9) that satisfies n = B^C - A.

2. Ground truth answer is 127, which checks out:
   - 127 = 100*1 + 10*2 + 7
   - 2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127

3. Proposed answer is 512:
   - 512 = 100*5 + 10*1 + 2
   - 1^2 - 5 = 1 - 5 = -4 ≠ 512

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the given equation, while the ground truth does. They are not equivalent.
