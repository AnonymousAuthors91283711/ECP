Explanation: The first condition implies either x=1 or y=2. The second implies either x=3 or z=-2. The intersection with x+y*z=9 divides into cases x=1 or x=3; for x=1, any y,z satisfy (x−1)=0, so (y−2) can be anything and the second condition implies (1−3)*(z+2)=−2*(z+2)=0 ⇒ z=−2 or false. For x=3, (3−1)*(y−2)=2*(y−2)=0 ⇒ y=2. Also from equation 3 + y*z=9 ⇒ 3 + 2*z=9 ⇒ z=3. So the set breaks down to two parts: all triples with x=1, y, any z satisfying y* z = 9 - 1=8 or (y,z) any, but (x−1)*(y−2)=0 means x=1, so (y,z) arbitrary but only if (x−3)*(z+2)=0 i.e. (1−3)*(z+2)=−2*(z+2)=0 ⇒ z=−2. Actually we need to confirm which pairs satisfy all. After re-checking, the sets reduce precisely to:

(x=1, any y, z=9 - x * y) = (1, y, 9 - y * z) with corrected z.

But since (x−1)(y−2)=0, so for x=1, the first is zero; for second, (x−3)(z+2)=0 is (1−3)(z+2)=−2*(z+2)=0 ⇒ z=−2.

So the set for x=1 becomes {(1,y, z=−2) | y ∈ ℝ, 1 + y*(−2) = 9} ⇒ 1 − 2 y=9 ⇒ y=−4.

So one solution at (1, −4, −2).

Similarly for x=3: (3−3)(z+2)=0 ⇒ 0*(z+2)=0 holds always, and (3−1)(y−2)=2*(y−2)=0 ⇒ y=2, and 3 + y*z=9 ⇒ 3 + 2*z=9 ⇒ z=3.

So solution (3,2,3).

Thus the answer set is precisely {(1, −4, −2), (3, 2, 3)}.

So the final set is:

Explanation:
We have the set defined by the conditions:
- (x - 1)*(y - 2) = 0
- (x - 3)*(z + 2) = 0
- x + y*z = 9

From the first two equations, we know x must be either 1 or 3 to satisfy these product-zero conditions.

Case 1: x = 1
Then (1 - 1)*(y - 2) = 0 trivially, and (1 - 3)*(z + 2) = -2*(z + 2) = 0, so z = -2. 
But the original proposed answer treated z as free — this is an error.
Check the third equation: 1 + y*z = 9 → y*z = 8.

So for x=1, z = -2 and y must satisfy y*(-2) = 8 → y = -4.

Hence, the unique triple for x=1 is (1, -4, -2).

Case 2: x = 3
Then (3 - 1)*(y - 2) = 2*(y - 2) = 0 → y = 2.

And (3 - 3)*(z + 2) = 0 trivially.

Third equation: 3 + y*z = 9 → 3 + 2*z = 9 → 2*z = 6 → z = 3.

Hence the triple is (3, 2, 3).

Therefore, the solution set is just two points:
{(1, -4, -2), (3, 2, 3)}.

This matches the problem constraints strictly and is a finite set, unlike the candidate answer.

Lean syntax note: to define a finite set of specific tuples, use Set.insert and Set.singleton or set notation.

Final Lean notation for the set:

{(1, -4, -2)} ∪ {(3, 2, 3)}.

We can write:

{(1, -4, -2), (3, 2, 3)} 

in Lean as
{(1, -4, -2), (3, 2, 3)}

which is shorthand for finite set literal.

Thus, the corrected and compile-able answer is the finite set with exactly those two triples.
