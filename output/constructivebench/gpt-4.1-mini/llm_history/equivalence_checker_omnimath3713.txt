The proposed answer is a general description of the set that matches the conditions given in the problem statement, while the ground truth answer provides specific solutions that satisfy these conditions. The proposed answer is correct in terms of expressing the constraints, but it doesn't explicitly list the solutions like the ground truth answer does. Therefore, they are not exactly equivalent, but the proposed answer is mostly correct in terms of the mathematical conditions.
