Ground Truth Answer: { fun _ => 0, fun x => x + 1 }
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℤ, ∀ z : ℤ, f z = c * z}
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is about finding all integer-valued functions f: ℤ → ℤ that satisfy the given functional equation for all integers a,b.

2. The ground truth provides two specific solutions:
   - The zero function (f(x) = 0)
   - The successor function (f(x) = x + 1)

3. The proposed answer suggests all linear functions of the form f(x) = c*x for some constant c.

4. Verification:
   - The zero function is included in both answers (c=0 case)
   - The successor function is not linear (can't be written as c*x)
   - The proposed answer misses the successor function solution
   - The proposed answer includes many other linear functions that may not satisfy the original equation

5. The successor function does satisfy the original equation:
   For f(x) = x + 1, the equation becomes:
   (a+b) + (a²+b²) = a(a+1) + b(b+1)
   Which simplifies to a² + b² + a + b = a² + a + b² + b, which holds true.

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incomplete as it misses the successor function solution.
