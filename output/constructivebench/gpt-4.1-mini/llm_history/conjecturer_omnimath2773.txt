The problem is to find the cardinality of the set of natural numbers \( n \) such that \( n > 0 \) and \( 111 \mod n = 6 \).

First, rewrite the congruence:

\[
111 \equiv 6 \pmod{n} \implies n \mid (111 - 6) = 105.
\]

Thus \( n \) divides 105, and since \( 111 \mod n = 6 \), \( n > 6 \). Also \( n \) must be positive.

So the set is all positive divisors of 105 greater than 6.

The divisors of 105 are:

\[
1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 35, 105.
\]

Those greater than 6 are \(7, 15, 21, 35, 105\).

Hence the set is \( \{7, 15, 21, 35, 105\} \), which has cardinality 5.

The Lean error comes from writing a set literal like `{5, 17}`, which Lean does not interpret as a finset, and also 17 is not a divisor here.

Instead, define the answer as a natural number literal corresponding to the count 5.

**Final Lean expression:**

<<<5>>>
