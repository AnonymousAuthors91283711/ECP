Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0), (1, 2), (-1, 3)}
Proposed Answer: { (x, y) : ℤ × ℤ | 7 * x + 14 * y = 5 * x^2 + 5 * x * y + 5 * y^2 }
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is exactly the same as the problem statement, just written in a different format (set comprehension notation). Both describe the set of integer pairs (x,y) that satisfy the given equation. The ground truth answer provides specific solutions, while the proposed answer gives the general condition, but they are equivalent representations of the same set.
