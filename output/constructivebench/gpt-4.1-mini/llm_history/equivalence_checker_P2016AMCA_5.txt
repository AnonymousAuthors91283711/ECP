Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | Even n ∧ n > 2 ∧ ∀ (p q : ℕ), p.Prime → q.Prime → p + q ≠ n}
Proposed Answer: { n | ∃ k : ℕ, n = 2 * k ∧ Nat.Prime k ∧ k > 1 }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the set of even numbers n > 2 that cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes (this is related to Goldbach's conjecture).

2. The ground truth answer correctly captures this: all even n > 2 where no two primes sum to n.

3. The proposed answer gives numbers that are twice a prime greater than 1 (i.e., numbers of form 2p where p is prime > 1).

While all numbers in the proposed answer are indeed even numbers > 2 that cannot be expressed as sum of two primes (since n = p + p would require p = q, but n = 2p, so p + p = 2p = n, but p is prime, so this would be a valid representation - which contradicts the condition), the proposed answer is actually incorrect because:

- It's too restrictive (only includes numbers of form 2p where p is prime)
- It misses other even numbers that might not be expressible as sum of two primes (like hypothetical counterexamples to Goldbach's conjecture)
- It actually includes numbers that CAN be expressed as sum of primes (like 6 = 3+3, 10 = 3+7, etc.)

Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect.
