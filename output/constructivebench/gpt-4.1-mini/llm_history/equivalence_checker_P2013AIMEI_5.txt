Ground Truth Answer: (81, 16, 3)
Proposed Answer: (27, 8, 63)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for positive integers a, b, c that satisfy:
   - A cubic equation involving cube roots of a and b, divided by c
   - The sum a + b + c = 98

2. Ground Truth Answer (81, 16, 3):
   - Sum: 81 + 16 + 3 = 100 ≠ 98 (This appears incorrect based on the problem statement)
   - Wait, this suggests the ground truth answer itself doesn't satisfy the sum condition

3. Proposed Answer (27, 8, 63):
   - Sum: 27 + 8 + 63 = 98 (correct)
   - Now check the cubic condition:
     The expression involves (27^(1/3) + 8^(1/3) + 1)/63 = (3 + 2 + 1)/63 = 6/63 = 2/21
     Plugging into the polynomial: 8*(2/21)^3 - 3*(2/21)^2 - 3*(2/21) - 1 ≈ -1.48 ≠ 0

4. Observations:
   - The ground truth answer fails the sum condition
   - The proposed answer fails the polynomial condition
   - Both answers are incorrect for different reasons
