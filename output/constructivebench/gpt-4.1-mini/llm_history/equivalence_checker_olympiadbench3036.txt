    (a r : ℝ)
    (hprod : a * (a * r) * (a * r ^ 2) * (a * r ^ 3) * (a * r ^ 4) = 32)

Ground Truth Answer: 4 / 17
Proposed Answer: (17 * 32 / 17 / 17 / 17)^(1/2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. From hforth (a * r³ = 17), we can express a = 17/r³
2. Substitute into hprod:
   (17/r³) * (17/r²) * (17/r) * (17) * (17*r) = 32
3. Simplify exponents: 17⁵ * r⁻⁵ = 32
4. From this, (17⁵ / r⁵) = 32 ⇒ (17/r)⁵ = 32 ⇒ 17/r = 2^(5/5) ⇒ 17/r = 2 ⇒ r = 17/2
5. Now a*r = (17/r³)*r = 17/r² = 17/(17/2)² = 17*4/17² = 4/17

The ground truth answer is indeed 4/17.

Now evaluate the proposed answer:
(17 * 32 / 17 / 17 / 17)^(1/2) = (32/17²)^(1/2) = (4*8/289)^(1/2) = (32/289)^(1/2) ≈ 0.3327

But 4/17 ≈ 0.2353, so they're not equal.
