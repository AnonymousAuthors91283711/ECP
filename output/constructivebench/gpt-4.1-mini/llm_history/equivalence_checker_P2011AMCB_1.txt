abbrev P2011AMCB_1_answer : â„š := sorry
theorem P2011AMCB_1 :
    (2 + 4 + 6) / (1 + 3 + 5) - (1 + 3 + 5) / (2 + 4 + 6) = P2011AMCB_1_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 7 / 12
Proposed Answer: 3/2
Let's evaluate both sides:

Left side calculation:
Numerator: (2+4+6)/(1+3+5) = 12/9 = 4/3
Denominator: (1+3+5)/(2+4+6) = 9/12 = 3/4
Subtraction: 4/3 - 3/4 = (16-9)/12 = 7/12

Ground truth is 7/12
Proposed answer is 3/2

These are clearly different values.
