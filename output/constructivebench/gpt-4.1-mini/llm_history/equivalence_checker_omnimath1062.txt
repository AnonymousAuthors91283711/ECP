Ground Truth Answer: 45
Proposed Answer: -1/17
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves summing terms of the form (2^n)*(-1)^(s(n)) for n from 0 to 15, where s(n) counts the number of 1's in the binary representation of n.

2. The ground truth answer is 45, which would be the numerator after simplifying the fraction (since the denominator in the problem is 255 = 256-1 = 2^8-1).

3. The proposed answer is -1/17. Note that 255 = 15*17, so -1/17 = -15/255, which is a completely different value from 45/255.

4. Calculating the sum manually for small values shows the ground truth is correct:
   - For n=0: 1*1 = 1
   - For n=1: 2*(-1) = -2
   - For n=2: 4*(-1) = -4
   - For n=3: 8*1 = 8
   Summing these first few terms already gives 3, which contradicts the proposed answer's trend.
