Ground Truth Answer: fun n k => k
Proposed Answer: fun n k => n * k / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimum number of mutual friendships (where both A is friends with B and B is friends with A) in a group of n people where each person has exactly k friends.

2. The ground truth answer is simply `k`, which seems counterintuitive at first glance.

3. The proposed answer is `n * k / 2`, which would be the total number of "friendship declarations" (since each of n people has k friends, total declarations is n*k, but each mutual friendship counts as 2 declarations).

The proposed answer is actually calculating the total number of friendships (both mutual and one-way), not the minimum number of mutual friendships as required. The ground truth answer correctly identifies that the minimum occurs when all friendships are one-way (no mutual friendships), hence the minimum number of mutual friendships is 0, not k. However, the problem seems to be about counting mutual friendships specifically.

Given that both answers seem incorrect for the problem as stated, but the proposed answer is definitely wrong in its interpretation of what's being counted, I'll return:

<<<False>>>
