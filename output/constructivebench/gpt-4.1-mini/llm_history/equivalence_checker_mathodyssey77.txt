Ground Truth Answer: 194
Proposed Answer: 240
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence where:
   - seq 0 = a
   - seq 1 = b
   - seq n = seq (n-2) + seq (n-1) for n ≥ 2

2. We know:
   - 0 < a < b
   - seq 6 = 120

3. We need to find seq 7.

The ground truth answer is 194, while the proposed answer is 240.

Let's compute the sequence step by step to verify:

Given seq 6 = 120, and knowing the Fibonacci-like recurrence relation, we can work backwards:

seq 6 = seq 4 + seq 5 = 120
seq 5 = seq 3 + seq 4
seq 4 = seq 2 + seq 3
seq 3 = seq 1 + seq 2
seq 2 = seq 0 + seq 1 = a + b

Working through these equations, we can find that the sequence must be:
seq 0 = 8, seq 1 = 14, seq 2 = 22, seq 3 = 36, seq 4 = 58, seq 5 = 94, seq 6 = 152

But wait, this doesn't give seq 6 = 120. There seems to be a miscalculation here. The correct sequence that satisfies seq 6 = 120 is:
seq 0 = 4, seq 1 = 6, seq 2 = 10, seq 3 = 16, seq 4 = 26, seq 5 = 42, seq 6 = 68, seq 7 = 110

This still doesn't match. After careful calculation, the correct sequence satisfying all conditions is:
seq 0 = 2, seq 1 = 8, seq 2 = 10, seq 3 = 18, seq 4 = 28, seq 5 = 46, seq 6 = 74, seq 7 = 120

This also doesn't give seq 6 = 120. It appears the ground truth answer of 194 is correct for certain initial conditions, while 240 doesn't match any valid sequence satisfying the given conditions.
