abbrev omnimath3493_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3493 (x : ℝ) (hx : x < -2) :
  IsLeast {y : ℝ | y = x ∨ y = x + 2 ∨ y = (1/2) * x ∨ y = x - 2 ∨ y = 2 * x} (omnimath3493_answer x) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 2 * x
Proposed Answer: fun x => x - 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the least element in the set {x, x+2, (1/2)x, x-2, 2x} when x < -2.

2. For x < -2:
   - x is negative
   - x+2 is negative (since x < -2 ⇒ x+2 < 0)
   - (1/2)x is negative
   - x-2 is more negative than x (x-2 < x)
   - 2x is more negative than x (2x < x when x < 0)

3. Comparing all elements when x < -2:
   - 2x is the smallest because:
     * 2x < x (since x < 0)
     * 2x < x-2 (since x < -2 ⇒ x < x-2 < 2x)
     * 2x < (1/2)x (since x < -2 ⇒ 2x < (1/2)x)
     * 2x < x+2 (since x < -2 ⇒ 2x < x+2)

4. The ground truth answer (2x) correctly identifies the smallest element.
5. The proposed answer (x-2) is incorrect because:
   - For x = -3: 2x = -6 vs x-2 = -5 ⇒ -6 < -5
   - For x = -4: 2x = -8 vs x-2 = -6 ⇒ -8 < -6

<<<False>>>
