Ground Truth Answer: 7
Proposed Answer: 36
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a unique natural number c that satisfies several conditions involving polynomial roots and square roots.

2. The ground truth answer is 7, which suggests that c=7 is the unique solution that makes all conditions hold.

3. The proposed answer is 36. However, 36 is a perfect square (6²), which directly contradicts the condition ¬IsSquare c in the problem statement.

4. The other conditions involve polynomial roots and relationships between a, b, c, and k, but since c=36 already violates one of the explicit conditions, it cannot be a valid solution.
