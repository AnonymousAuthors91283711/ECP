  IsLeast {K : ℕ | 4 * 3 * 2 * K ≥ 70} olympiadbench2661_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number K such that 4 * 3 * 2 * K ≥ 70.

2. Calculating the left side: 4 * 3 * 2 = 24, so we need the smallest K where 24K ≥ 70.

3. Solving for K: K ≥ 70/24 ≈ 2.916...

4. Since K must be a natural number, the smallest integer satisfying this is 3 (ground truth answer).

5. The proposed answer is 6, which satisfies the inequality (24*6=144≥70) but is not the least such number.

The proposed answer is incorrect because while it satisfies the inequality, it's not the smallest natural number that does so.

<<<False>>>
