(hx : x = 3)
: -(5 * x - 6 * x) = omnimath2771_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: -3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us x = 3 and asks to evaluate -(5x - 6x)
2. Let's compute step by step:
   - First evaluate inside parentheses: 5x - 6x = -x
   - Then apply the negative sign: -(-x) = x
   - Since x = 3, the final result is 3

The ground truth answer is 3, which matches our calculation.
The proposed answer is -3, which is incorrect.
