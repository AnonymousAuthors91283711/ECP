Ground Truth Answer: 79
Proposed Answer: 97
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the largest two-digit number N (between 10 and 99) where:
   - The reverse of N is prime
   - The reverse of 4*N is prime
   - The reverse of 5*N is prime

2. Ground truth answer is 79:
   - Reverse of 79 is 97 (prime)
   - 4*79 = 316 → reverse is 613 (prime)
   - 5*79 = 395 → reverse is 593 (prime)

3. Proposed answer is 97:
   - Reverse of 97 is 79 (prime)
   - 4*97 = 388 → reverse is 883 (prime)
   - 5*97 = 485 → reverse is 584 (not prime, since 584 is divisible by 2)

The proposed answer fails the third condition (reverse of 5*97 is not prime), while the ground truth answer satisfies all conditions. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
