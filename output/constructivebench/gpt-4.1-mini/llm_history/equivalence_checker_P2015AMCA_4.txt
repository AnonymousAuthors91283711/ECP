Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => if x > y then x / y else y / x
Proposed Answer: fun x y => (3 : ℝ) / 2
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem gives us the equation x + y = 5(x - y) with x,y > 0
2. Solving this equation: x + y = 5x - 5y → 6y = 4x → y = (2/3)x
3. The ground truth answer gives a piecewise function: if x > y then x/y else y/x
4. Since y = (2/3)x and x > 0, we have two cases:
   - If x > y (which is true since 1 > 2/3), then x/y = x/((2/3)x) = 3/2
   - If x ≤ y (which never happens under given constraints), y/x would apply
5. The proposed answer is always 3/2, which matches the ground truth when x > y (which is always true under the given constraints)

The proposed answer is correct under the problem's constraints (x,y > 0 and x + y = 5(x-y)), but the ground truth answer is more general (works for all positive x,y). However, since the problem specifically asks about the solution under these constraints, the answers are equivalent in this context.
