Ground Truth Answer: 9 / 100
Proposed Answer: 0.21
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves trigonometric identities and exact values.
2. The ground truth answer is given as an exact fraction: 9/100 = 0.09
3. The proposed answer is 0.21, which is not equal to 0.09

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the ground truth value. The difference is significant (0.21 vs 0.09), so this isn't a case of approximation or domain restriction issues.

<<<False>>>
