Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (-1)^(ceil (n / 2 : ℚ) - 1) * 2 * ceil (n / 2 : ℚ)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (-1)^(n - 1) * (n : ℤ)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer is:
(-1)^(ceil(n/2) - 1) * 2 * ceil(n/2)

The proposed answer is:
(-1)^(n - 1) * n

Let's test some values to check equivalence:

For n=1:
Ground truth: (-1)^(1-1)*2*1 = 2
Proposed: (-1)^0*1 = 1
Different

For n=2:
Ground truth: (-1)^(1-1)*2*1 = 2
Proposed: (-1)^1*2 = -2
Different

For n=3:
Ground truth: (-1)^(2-1)*2*2 = -4
Proposed: (-1)^2*3 = 3
Different

For n=4:
Ground truth: (-1)^(2-1)*2*2 = -4
Proposed: (-1)^3*4 = -4
Same

For n=5:
Ground truth: (-1)^(3-1)*2*3 = 6
Proposed: (-1)^4*5 = 5
Different

The answers only match at n=4 and diverge elsewhere. The patterns are clearly different.
