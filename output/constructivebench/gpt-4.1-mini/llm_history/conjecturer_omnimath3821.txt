The error arises because Lean expects the right-hand side of a function definition to be specified with `↦` or `=>` rather than a comma. We also want to specify a set of functions of the form f(x) = a * x + b where a = 2 and b = -1 (so simply f(x) = 2x - 1).

A more concise and correct expression for the set is:

{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a b : ℝ, (f = λ x, a * x + b) ∧ a = 2 ∧ b = -1}

or even better, since a and b are fixed by the equations, just:

{f : ℝ → ℝ | f = λ x, 2 * x - 1}

which directly characterizes the unique function satisfying the equation.

Thus, the fixed Lean expression is:

<<<{ f : ℝ → ℝ | f = λ x, 2 * x - 1 }>>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error arises because in set-builder notation `{f : ℝ → ℝ | ...}`, the condition on `f` must be a proposition. Writing `f = λ x, 2 * x - 1` is problematic because `λ x, 2 * x - 1` is a function expression and the syntax expects something like `f x = ...` for all `x`. A better approach is to express the set of all functions equal to this specific function by stating: `∀ x, f x = 2 * x - 1`.

Hence, the fixed definition should be:

```lean
{ f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x, f x = 2 * x - 1 }
```

This declares the set of all functions `f` such that for every real number `x`, `f x` equals `2x - 1`.
