Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 3), (5, 8), (8, 13)}
Proposed Answer: {p : ℕ × ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, k > 0 ∧ p.1 = 2 * k ∧ p.2 = 3 * k}
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem defines a Fibonacci sequence F with F(1)=1, F(2)=1 and the standard recurrence relation.

2. The ground truth answer gives specific pairs (2,3), (5,8), (8,13) that satisfy 5F(p₁) - 3F(p₂) = 1.

3. The proposed answer suggests all pairs where the first element is twice some k and the second is thrice k (i.e., pairs (2k,3k)).

Testing the proposed solution:
- For k=1: (2,3) - matches ground truth
- For k=2: (4,6) - F(4)=3, F(6)=8 → 5*3-3*8 = 15-24 = -9 ≠ 1
- For k=3: (6,9) - F(6)=8, F(9)=34 → 5*8-3*34 = 40-102 = -62 ≠ 1

The proposed answer only works for k=1 (which gives (2,3)), but fails for other values of k. It also misses the valid pairs (5,8) and (8,13) from the ground truth.
