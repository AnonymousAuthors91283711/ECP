Ground Truth Answer: 24
Proposed Answer: 50 * 30
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem gives us:
   - Average of 20 xs values is 30 ⇒ ∑xs = 20*30 = 600
   - Average of 30 ys values is 20 ⇒ ∑ys = 30*20 = 600
   - Combined average of all 50 values is (∑xs + ∑ys)/50 = (600 + 600)/50 = 1200/50 = 24

2. The proposed answer is 50 * 30 = 1500, which is clearly different from the correct answer of 24.

The proposed answer incorrectly multiplies the total number of elements (50) by one of the averages (30), which is not the correct approach for finding the combined average.
