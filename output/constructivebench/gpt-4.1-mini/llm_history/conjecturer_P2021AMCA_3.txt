<<<13002>>> 
Explanation: Let a = 10k and b = k. From a + b = 17402, we get 11k = 17402 ⇒ k = 1582. Then a = 10*1582 = 15820, b = 1582, and a - b = 15820 - 1582 = 14238 (which differs from enumerated expected answer). Checking again: a + b = 17402, and b = a/10 ⇒ b = k ⇒ a = 10k. So 10k + k = 17402 ⇒ 11k = 17402 ⇒ k = 1582, so a = 15820, b=1582, then a - b = 15820 - 1582 = 14238, not 13002.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is a - b = 13002, so testing for that:

Set a - b = x, and b = a/10 ⇒ then b = a/10, so a - a/10 = 9a/10 = x ⇒ x = 9a/10 ⇒ a = 10x/9

From a + b = 17402 and b = a/10 ⇒ a + a/10 = 17402 ⇒ 11a /10 = 17402 ⇒ a = (17402*10)/11 = 15820

Then a - b = a - a/10 = 9a/10 = 9 * 15820 /10 = 14238

Hence the value is 14238, consistent with these constraints.

But the enumerated answer is 13002, so likely the original problem setup is different or has an error.

Without enumerated errors, final answer:

<<<14238>>>
