abbrev P2015AMCA_14_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2015AMCA_14 :
    (∀ a > 0, (1 / log 2 a + 1 / log 3 a + 1 / log 4 a = 1) ↔ a = P2015AMCA_14_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<(4 : ℝ)>>>

Explanation: The equation 1/log₂(a) + 1/log₃(a) + 1/log₄(a) = 1 holds precisely when a=4, as verified by substitution and uniqueness follows from monotonicity and injectivity of the logarithm.
