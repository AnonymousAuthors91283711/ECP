Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the infimum of the set {x ∈ ℝ | ∃ y > 0, x > 0 ∧ x + y² = x*y}.

2. The equation x + y² = x*y can be rewritten as x(y - 1) = y².

3. For y > 0 and y ≠ 1, we can express x as x = y²/(y - 1).

4. We need to find the minimum value of x = y²/(y - 1) for y > 0, y ≠ 1.

5. Taking the derivative and finding critical points, we find the minimum occurs at y = 2, giving x = 4.

6. The ground truth answer is 4, which is correct based on this analysis.

7. The proposed answer is 1, which is incorrect as:
   - At y approaches 1 from above, x approaches infinity
   - At y approaches 0 from above, x approaches 0
   - The minimal positive x occurs at y=2 with x=4

<<<False>>>
