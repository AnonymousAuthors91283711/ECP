Ground Truth Answer: 18 * π
Proposed Answer: (5 / (1 - 2/3)) * (π / 6) * 12
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem defines:
   - r0 = 5
   - ratio = 2/3
   - ω = π/6
   - t = 12
   - total_distance formula: 2 * π * (r0 / (1 - ratio)) * (ω * t / (2 * π))

2. Simplifying the total_distance formula:
   - The 2 * π and 1/(2 * π) cancel out
   - We get: (r0 / (1 - ratio)) * ω * t

3. Plugging in the values:
   - (5 / (1 - 2/3)) * (π/6) * 12
   - (5 / (1/3)) * (π/6) * 12
   - 15 * (π/6) * 12
   - 15 * 2 * π
   - 30π

4. The ground truth answer is 18π, but our calculation shows 30π

5. The proposed answer matches our calculation: (5 / (1 - 2/3)) * (π / 6) * 12

However, this contradicts the ground truth answer of 18π. There seems to be a discrepancy between the formula given in the problem statement and the ground truth answer.
