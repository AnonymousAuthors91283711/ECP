abbrev P2014AMCB_17_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2014AMCB_17 :
  ∃ r s, (∀ m, ¬ ∃ x, x^2 = 14 + m * (x - 20) ↔ r < m ∧ m < s) ∧ r + s = P2014AMCB_17_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: 10, 14. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 36, which is at ", 14" in "abbrev P2014AMCB_17_answer : ℝ := 10, 14", there is an error: unexpected token ','; expected command.

The problem states that there exist numbers r and s such that a certain equivalence involving x^2 = 14 + m (x - 20) holds if and only if r < m < s, and the sum r + s equals a certain real number. From the context, you tried to assign "10, 14" as the answer, but Lean expects a single real value for P2014AMCB_17_answer because it is given type ℝ, not a pair.

Since from enumeration you have 10 and 14, likely these are the values of r and s, and the problem wants r + s as the answer, which is 24. So the best candidate for P2014AMCB_17_answer is 24.

Hence, in Lean:

P2014AMCB_17_answer : ℝ := 24

Explanation:

- P2014AMCB_17_answer is a real number.

- The answer is the sum r + s, where r = 10 and s = 14, so the sum is 24.

Therefore, the correct final answer should be 24.
