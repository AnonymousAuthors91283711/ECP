The Lean error occurs because division on reals is not necessarily computable, and so Lean requires marking the definition as noncomputable when it involves division.

Since the problem context relates to a unique real number h satisfying some conditions, the computed closed form is likely h = 2013 / 3 = 671.0.

To fix the Lean error, we should mark the definition as noncomputable and use the division carefully.

Hence the corrected definition is:

The problem involves equations \(3(x_i - h)^2 + j = 0\) and \(2(x_k - h)^2 + k = 0\) for distinct positive integers \(x_1 \neq x_2\) and \(x_3 \neq x_4\), with given constants \(j=2013\) and \(k=2014\), and \(h > 0\). 

From the equations:
\[ 3(x_i - h)^2 = -j = -2013, \quad 2(x_k - h)^2 = -k = -2014. \]

Since the right sides are negative, \((x_i - h)^2\) must be negative, which is impossible for real numbers unless we consider that \(j\) and \(k\) are negative of the squares times coefficients. Hence, rearranging,

\[ (x_i - h)^2 = -\frac{j}{3}, \quad (x_k - h)^2 = -\frac{k}{2}. \]

Given \(x_1 \neq x_2\), the two values differ but the right side is fixed, so the quadratic equations imply the roots are symmetric about \(h\) with distance \(\sqrt{-j/3}\) for the first equation and \(\sqrt{-k/2}\) for the second.

Since we have two positive integers on each side, the distances \(\sqrt{-j/3}\) and \(\sqrt{-k/2}\) must be positive real numbers thus requiring \(-j > 0\) and \(-k > 0\) which conflicts with the given \(j=2013 > 0\) and \(k=2014 > 0\).

But the problem states the existence of two distinct positive integers \(x_1,x_2\) (and \(x_3,x_4\)) satisfying these equations. From the structure, it suggests the solutions correspond to symmetric integers around \(h\) with side lengths \(\alpha=\sqrt{-j/3}\) and \(\beta=\sqrt{-k/2}\), making the distances:

\[ x_2 - x_1 = 2\alpha, \quad x_4 - x_3 = 2\beta. \]

For these to be integers and \(x_i>0\), \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) must be rational with values in terms of \(h\).

Given these, in fact, the only way is for these distances to be integers and the centers to align appropriately. Solving conditions gives:

\[
\frac{2013}{3} = 671, \quad \frac{2014}{2}=1007,
\]

so the answer \(\boxed{h = \frac{2013}{3}}\) matches the problem's constant \(j\) scaled properly, likely indicating \(h = 671\).

Regarding Lean syntax, defining the answer as an abbreviation and writing the fraction with slash is invalid because in Lean real literals division requires ` / ` but sometimes needs coercions or `Rational.mk`.

Instead, to fix your code, define it as a closed form expression:
