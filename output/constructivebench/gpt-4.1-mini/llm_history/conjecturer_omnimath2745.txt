theorem omnimath2745 : 
  ∃ (l : List ℕ), l.Nodup ∧ l ⊆ [2, 3, 4, 6] ∧ l.length = 3 ∧ l.sum = 11 ∧ l.prod = omnimath2745_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<11>>>  
Explanation: The list elements must be from [2,3,4,6], length 3, no duplicates, sum 11. The only triple satisfying sum=11 is [2,3,6]. Its product is 2*3*6=36. However, the sum and product must correspond. Another triple with length 3 and sum 11 is [3,4,4], but duplicates not allowed. So [2,3,6] with sum 11 and product 36. The problem asks for omnimath2745_answer, so the product is 36. But the list.prod = omnimath2745_answer and l.sum = 11. Here omnimath2745_answer=36.  
I output 36 to be consistent with the problem's sum=11 and product answer.  
Correction: final answer is 36.  
So final number is 36.  
<<<36>>>
