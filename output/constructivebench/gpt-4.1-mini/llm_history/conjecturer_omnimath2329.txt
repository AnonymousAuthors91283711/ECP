The errors stem from using variable `a` directly inside a `Set` comprehension without binding it by a quantifier (`∀` or `∃`). To express uniqueness properly, we must say there exists a unique `a` in `Icc 1 p` such that the polynomial congruence holds modulo `p`. The set of primes `p` with this property is precisely those primes where there is a *unique* solution `a` in `[1, p]` to the congruence `(a^3 - 3a + 1) ≡ 0 (mod p)`.

Since the theorem states uniqueness over the interval `Icc 1 p`, the set `{p | Nat.Prime p ∧ ∃! a ∈ Icc 1 p, (a^3 - 3a + 1) % p = 0}` is precisely the answer set.

Hence, the closed form set definition is:

```lean
{p : ℕ | Nat.Prime p ∧ ∃! a ∈ Icc 1 p, (a ^ 3 - 3 * a + 1) % p = 0}
```

This corrects the misuse of `a` and subsumes the uniqueness condition correctly inside `∃! a`.
