abbrev omnimath2988_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2988 (x : ℝ) :
  x / 90 - x / 120 = 16 / 60 ↔ x = omnimath2988_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 96
Proposed Answer: 288
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation given is: x/90 - x/120 = 16/60
2. Let's solve it step by step:
   - Find common denominator for left side (360): (4x - 3x)/360 = 16/60
   - Simplify: x/360 = 16/60
   - Cross multiply: 60x = 360*16
   - Calculate: 60x = 5760
   - Divide both sides by 60: x = 96

The ground truth answer is 96, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 288, which is incorrect (it's exactly 3 times the correct answer, suggesting a possible error in denominator handling).
