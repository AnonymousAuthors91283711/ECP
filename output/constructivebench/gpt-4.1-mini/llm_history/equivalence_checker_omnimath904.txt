Ground Truth Answer: Real.sqrt 6 / 2
Proposed Answer: 3 / 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two positive real numbers x and y with:
   - x² + y² = 1 (they lie on the unit circle)
   - A specific product condition involving cubic terms
   - Asks for the value of x + y

2. The ground truth answer is √6/2 ≈ 1.2247
3. The proposed answer is 3/2 = 1.5

These are clearly different numerical values, and they cannot be equivalent. The proposed answer is significantly larger than the ground truth answer.

To verify further:
- The maximum possible value of x + y under x² + y² = 1 is √2 ≈ 1.4142 (when x = y)
- 3/2 is close to this maximum, but the additional condition (hprod) would constrain it further
- The ground truth answer √6/2 is more plausible as it's between 1 and √2
