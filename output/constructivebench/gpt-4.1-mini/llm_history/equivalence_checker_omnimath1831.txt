Ground Truth Answer: {0, I * Real.sqrt 6, -I * Real.sqrt 6}
Proposed Answer: {z | z^3 = -1}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding all complex numbers a, b, c that satisfy the system:
   a² = b - c
   b² = c - a
   c² = a - b
   and relating them to the sum a + b + c.

2. The ground truth answer gives specific values for the sum: 0, i√6, -i√6.

3. The proposed answer suggests that the sum z = a + b + c satisfies z³ = -1.

Let's verify:
- If z = 0: 0³ = 0 ≠ -1 → doesn't satisfy proposed answer
- If z = i√6: (i√6)³ = i³6√6 = -i6√6 ≠ -1 → doesn't satisfy
- If z = -i√6: similar calculation shows it doesn't satisfy

The proposed answer is completely different from the ground truth. The roots of z³ = -1 are the three cube roots of -1, which are completely different numbers from {0, i√6, -i√6}.
