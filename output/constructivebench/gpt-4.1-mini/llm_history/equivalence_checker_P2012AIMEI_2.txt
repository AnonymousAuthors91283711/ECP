Ground Truth Answer: 195
Proposed Answer: 143
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives two equations:
   - h₁: n*(2a + (n-1)d) = 1430 (sum of arithmetic sequence)
   - h₂: n*(2a + (n-1)d) + n² = 1672

2. From h₁ and h₂, we can derive n² = 1672 - 1430 = 242 ⇒ n = √242 ≈ 15.56, but n must be integer. This suggests there might be a typo in the problem statement.

3. The ground truth answer is 195, while the proposed answer is 143.

4. The proposed answer (143) appears to be just taking the value from h₁ (1430) divided by 10, which doesn't seem to follow from any logical derivation.

5. The ground truth answer (195) would require proper solving of the equations and substitution, which isn't possible with the given equations as they lead to a non-integer n.

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect and doesn't match the ground truth answer.
