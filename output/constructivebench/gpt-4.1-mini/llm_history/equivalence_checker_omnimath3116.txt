Ground Truth Answer: 11
Proposed Answer: 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n that satisfies the given conditions involving r, y, and b.

2. The conditions imply that:
   - (10 - r) = (7 - y) = (3 - b) = k (let's call this common difference k)
   - n = 3k (since it's the sum of three equal terms)
   - r ≤ 10, y ≤ 7, b ≤ 3

3. To find the minimal n, we need to find the maximal possible k that satisfies:
   - r = 10 - k ≥ 0 ⇒ k ≤ 10
   - y = 7 - k ≥ 0 ⇒ k ≤ 7
   - b = 3 - k ≥ 0 ⇒ k ≤ 3

4. The maximum k satisfying all constraints is 3, making n = 3*3 = 9.

5. However, the ground truth answer is 11, which suggests a different interpretation.

The proposed answer (9) is mathematically correct based on the given constraints, while the ground truth answer (11) appears incorrect. This suggests the proposed answer is actually right.
