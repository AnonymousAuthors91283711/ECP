Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => a ^ (logb 2 a) * 2 ^ (b ^ 2)
Proposed Answer: fun a b => (a ^ (b + 3)) * (2 ^ b)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two equations:
   - a * 2^b = 8
   - a^b = 2
   And asks us to find an expression that equals 128 under these constraints.

2. Ground Truth Answer:
   a^(log₂ a) * 2^(b²)
   This is derived by solving the equations to express everything in terms of a and b.

3. Proposed Answer:
   (a^(b + 3)) * (2^b)
   Let's test if this equals the ground truth under the given constraints.

From h2: a^b = 2 ⇒ b = logₐ 2
From h1: a = 8/2^b

Substituting into ground truth:
(8/2^b)^(log₂ (8/2^b)) * 2^(b²)

Substituting into proposed answer:
(8/2^b)^(b + 3) * 2^b

These are clearly different expressions. Let's test with a concrete example that satisfies the constraints:
Let a = 2, b = 1 (satisfies both equations)
Ground truth: 2^(log₂ 2) * 2^(1²) = 2^1 * 2^1 = 4
Proposed answer: 2^(1+3) * 2^1 = 2^4 * 2 = 32
These give different results, so the answers are not equivalent.
