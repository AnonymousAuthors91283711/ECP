The error in your Lean code originates from how you are trying to define the set using `<<<...>>>`. Those delimiters are for this chat interface to indicate your final solution only, not part of Lean syntax. In Lean, sets are typically defined using set notation as `set ℝ` or predicates defining membership.

Additionally, the provided set `{x | x = -10 / 63}` defines a singleton set containing `-10/63`. To fix this, you can define the set as `{ -10 / 63 }`, which is a set literal in Lean, or equivalently as `set_of (λ x, x = -10 / 63)`.

Here is a correct Lean definition of your answer set:

```lean
{ -10 / 63 }
```

In the context of your abbreviation:

```lean
abbrev olympiadbench2328_answer : Set ℝ := { -10 / 63 }
```

This defines the set of real numbers containing exactly the value `-10/63`, matching your intended answer from the problem and avoiding the syntax error.

Explanation:  
- The problem states a relationship involving sequences and a parameter `d`.  
- From the sequence definitions and the equality condition given, the unique `d` satisfying the condition is the one where the ratio of the geometric sequence equals the ratio of the arithmetic sequence at indices 6 and 4.  
- Solving that gives `d = -10 / 63`.  
- Thus, the solution set is the singleton `{ -10 / 63 }`.  

<<<{ -10 / 63 }>>>
