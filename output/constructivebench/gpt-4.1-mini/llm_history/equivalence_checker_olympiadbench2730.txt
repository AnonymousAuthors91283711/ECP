Ground Truth Answer: fun T => (T - 13) * (30 - 16) / (20 - 13) + 16
Proposed Answer: fun T => (2 * T + 19) / 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes an arithmetic sequence where:
   - aₙ = a₁ + (n-1)*d
   - a₁₆ = 13
   - a₃₀ = 20

2. From the arithmetic sequence formula:
   a₁₆ = a₁ + 15d = 13
   a₃₀ = a₁ + 29d = 20
   Subtracting: 14d = 7 ⇒ d = 1/2
   Then a₁ = 13 - 15*(1/2) = 11/2

3. The general term is:
   aₙ = 11/2 + (n-1)*(1/2) = (11 + n - 1)/2 = (n + 10)/2

4. Solving for n when aₙ = T:
   (n + 10)/2 = T ⇒ n = 2T - 10

5. The ground truth answer is:
   (T - 13)*14/7 + 16 = 2(T - 13) + 16 = 2T - 26 + 16 = 2T - 10

6. The proposed answer is:
   (2T + 19)/3

Comparing the correct expression (2T - 10) with the proposed answer (2T + 19)/3, they are clearly different functions. For example:
- When T = 13: correct gives 16, proposed gives 15
- When T = 20: correct gives 30, proposed gives ~19.67
