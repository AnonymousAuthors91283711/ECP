Ground Truth Answer: 1000
Proposed Answer: (10 : ℝ)^2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find the positive real x that satisfies the given logarithmic equation.

2. The ground truth answer is 1000, which is indeed the correct solution to this equation (you can verify by substitution).

3. The proposed answer is (10 : ℝ)^2, which equals 100.

4. 100 is not equal to 1000, so the answers are not equivalent.
