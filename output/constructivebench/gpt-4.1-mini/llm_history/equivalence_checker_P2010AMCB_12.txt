theorem P2010AMCB_12 (x : ℝ) (hx : x > 0) : 5 * logb 2 x = 40 ↔ x = P2010AMCB_12_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 256
Proposed Answer: 32
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us the equation: 5 * log₂ x = 40
2. We can simplify this to: log₂ x = 8
3. Converting from logarithmic to exponential form: x = 2⁸
4. Calculating 2⁸ gives us 256

The ground truth answer is 256, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 32, which would be correct if the equation was log₂ x = 5 (since 2⁵ = 32), but this doesn't match the given equation.

<<<False>>>
