theorem omnimath3723 (a b : ℕ) (ha : 0 < a) (hb : 0 < b) :
  Nat.Prime (a^4 + 4*b^4) ↔ (a, b) ∈ omnimath3723_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1)}
Proposed Answer: {(x, y) | ∃ k, x = 2*k + 1 ∧ y = 1}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks when a⁴ + 4b⁴ is prime, given a, b > 0.

2. The ground truth answer {(1, 1)} suggests that only when a=1 and b=1 is the expression prime (which gives 1+4=5, indeed prime).

3. The proposed answer suggests all odd a with b=1 would work. But let's test:
   - For a=3, b=1: 3⁴ + 4*1⁴ = 81 + 4 = 85 (not prime)
   - For a=5, b=1: 5⁴ + 4*1⁴ = 625 + 4 = 629 (629 = 17×37, not prime)
   - Only a=1 works from this set.

The proposed answer includes many cases that don't satisfy the condition, while the ground truth correctly identifies the only solution.
