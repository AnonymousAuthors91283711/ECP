Ground Truth Answer: 4^7
Proposed Answer: 64
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking which of the given equations has a natural number solution for n. We need to check each case:
   - n² = 2³ = 8 → No natural n satisfies this (√8 ≈ 2.828)
   - n² = 3⁵ = 243 → No natural n satisfies this (√243 ≈ 15.588)
   - n² = 4⁷ = 16384 → Yes, n = 128 satisfies this (128² = 16384)
   - n² = 5⁹ = 1953125 → No natural n satisfies this (√1953125 ≈ 1397.542)
   - n² = 6¹¹ = 362797056 → No natural n satisfies this (√362797056 ≈ 19047.2)

2. The ground truth answer correctly identifies 4⁷ as the only case that works (128² = 4⁷ = 16384).

3. The proposed answer gives 64, which is 4³ or 8², but:
   - 64 is not equal to any of the right-hand sides in the problem
   - 64 is not a solution to any of the given equations
   - 64 is not even a square of any of the exponents shown

The proposed answer is completely incorrect and unrelated to the correct solution.
