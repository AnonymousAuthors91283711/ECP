Ground Truth Answer: 10
Proposed Answer: 100
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents an equation:
   (4*16 + 6*N)/(10*(16 + N)) = 58/100
   and asks to find the value of N that satisfies this equation.

2. Let's solve the equation step by step:
   - First, simplify numerator and denominator:
     (64 + 6N)/(160 + 10N) = 58/100
   - Cross multiply:
     100*(64 + 6N) = 58*(160 + 10N)
   - Expand:
     6400 + 600N = 9280 + 580N
   - Subtract 580N from both sides:
     6400 + 20N = 9280
   - Subtract 6400 from both sides:
     20N = 2880
   - Divide by 20:
     N = 144

3. The ground truth answer is 10, which is clearly incorrect based on our calculation.

4. The proposed answer is 100, which is also incorrect.

However, the correct solution shows N should be 144. Both given answers are wrong, but they're both wrong in different ways. Since neither matches the correct solution, they're not equivalent to each other.
