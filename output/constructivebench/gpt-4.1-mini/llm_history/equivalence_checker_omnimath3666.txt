Ground Truth Answer: 24
Proposed Answer: 60
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

The problem is asking for the greatest natural number n where:
1. n > 0
2. For every k where 0 < k ≤ n/2, there exists divisors d₁,d₂ of n such that d₂ - d₁ = k

The ground truth answer is 24. Let's check the proposed answer 60:

For 24:
- Divisors: 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24
- All differences from 1 to 12 (24/2) can be formed:
  1=2-1, 2=3-1, ..., 6=12-6, ..., 12=24-12

For 60:
- Divisors: 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60
- Most differences work, but 23 is problematic:
  - 60/2 = 30, so we need to cover up to 30
  - There are no two divisors whose difference is 23
  - The largest possible difference <30 is 30-1=29, but 23 is missing

Therefore, 60 fails the condition when k=23, while 24 satisfies all conditions. The proposed answer is incorrect.
