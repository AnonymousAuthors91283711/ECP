Ground Truth Answer: 59
Proposed Answer: 44
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have four equations involving four natural numbers a, b, c, d.
2. Each equation gives the average of three of these numbers.
3. The problem asks for the maximum of the maximum pairs (max of max(a,b) and max(c,d)).

To determine if the proposed answer (44) matches the ground truth (59):

1. First, let's solve the system of equations:
   - From h₁: a + b + c = 96
   - From h₂: a + b + d = 117
   - From h₃: a + c + d = 120
   - From h₄: b + c + d = 132

2. Solving these:
   - Subtract h₁ from h₂: d - c = 21 ⇒ d = c + 21
   - Subtract h₂ from h₃: c - b = 3 ⇒ c = b + 3
   - Subtract h₃ from h₄: b - a = 12 ⇒ b = a + 12

3. Substituting back:
   - c = a + 15
   - d = a + 36
   - Original equation: 3a + 27 = 96 ⇒ a = 23
   - Therefore: b = 35, c = 38, d = 59

4. The maximum value is clearly d = 59, not 44.

The proposed answer (44) is incorrect as it matches none of the individual variable values nor the maximum.
