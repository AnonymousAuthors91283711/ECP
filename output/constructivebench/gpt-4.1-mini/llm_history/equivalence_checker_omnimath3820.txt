Ground Truth Answer: Ici 13500
Proposed Answer: {N | 0 < N ∧ N ≤ 9000}
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is about finding natural numbers N where there exists a range of 1000 consecutive numbers (k to k+999) where all numbers in that range have digit sums equal to N.

2. The ground truth answer "Ici 13500" suggests the correct answer is 13500 (though the meaning of "Ici" is unclear - possibly a placeholder).

3. The proposed answer {N | 0 < N ∧ N ≤ 9000} claims that any positive N up to 9000 satisfies the condition.

Key observations:
- The maximum digit sum for a 4-digit number is 9+9+9+9=36, but this doesn't directly relate to the problem
- For numbers with more digits, the maximum possible digit sum increases, but the problem requires finding a range where ALL numbers have the same digit sum
- The proposed answer's upper bound of 9000 seems arbitrary and unsupported
- The ground truth suggests a specific number (13500) which contradicts the proposed range

Conclusion: The answers are not equivalent. The proposed answer is incorrect as it suggests a range of solutions when the ground truth indicates a specific value is correct.
