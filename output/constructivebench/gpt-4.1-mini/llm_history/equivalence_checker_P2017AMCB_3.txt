Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: -1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us an equation (3x + y)/(x - 3y) = -2 and asks us to find the value of (x + 3y)/(3x - y).

2. From the given equation:
   (3x + y)/(x - 3y) = -2
   => 3x + y = -2x + 6y
   => 5x = 5y
   => x = y

3. Substituting x = y into the expression we need to evaluate:
   (x + 3y)/(3x - y) = (y + 3y)/(3y - y) = (4y)/(2y) = 2

The ground truth answer is indeed 2, while the proposed answer is -1. These are clearly different values.
