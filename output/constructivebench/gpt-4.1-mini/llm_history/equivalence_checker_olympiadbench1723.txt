Ground Truth Answer: fun N => 2^(N - 2) + 1
Proposed Answer: fun N => N + 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal number M such that any collection of M boolean functions on N variables must contain a subset of N functions that agree on a common output value for each input position.

2. The ground truth answer is 2^(N-2) + 1, which grows exponentially with N. This makes sense combinatorially because we're dealing with all possible boolean functions (of which there are 2^N), and we need enough to guarantee a certain pattern.

3. The proposed answer is N + 1, which grows linearly. This is far too small to guarantee the required property, as it doesn't account for the exponential growth of possible boolean function combinations.

4. For example, when N=4:
- Ground truth: 2^(4-2)+1 = 5
- Proposed: 4+1 = 5
They happen to match at N=4, but diverge quickly:
- For N=5: 9 vs 6
- For N=6: 17 vs 7

The proposed answer is incorrect for most cases beyond N=4.
