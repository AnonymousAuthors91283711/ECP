abbrev omnimath1626_answer : ℕ × ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1626 (a b : ℕ) (ha : 0 < a) (hb : 0 < b) :
  (∑ i in Finset.range a, ∑ j in Finset.range b, (i * b + j + 1)) -

  omnimath1626_answer (a, b) = 21 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun (a, b) => a + b
Proposed Answer: fun ab : ℕ × ℕ => if ab = (7, 3) then 21 else 0
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem is asking for a function omnimath1626_answer that satisfies the given theorem, where the double sum difference equals 1200 iff the function evaluates to 21.

2. The ground truth answer suggests that a + b is the correct solution, meaning when a + b = 21, the equation holds.

3. The proposed answer only returns 21 when (a,b) = (7,3), and 0 otherwise. This is a very specific case that might satisfy the equation (since 7+3=10≠21, it doesn't match the ground truth).

4. The proposed answer is incorrect because:
   - It doesn't match the general form of a + b
   - It only works for one specific case (if at all)
   - The condition ab = (7,3) doesn't satisfy a + b = 21
