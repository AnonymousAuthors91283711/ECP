theorem P2021AMCB_16 (a b c : ℚ) (h : 1 < a ∧ a < b ∧ b < c) :
  (∀ (f : ℚ[X]), f = X^3 + C a * X^2 + C b * X + C c →

Ground Truth Answer: fun a b c => (1 + a + b + c) / c
Proposed Answer: fun a b c => a⁻¹ + b⁻¹ + c⁻¹ - 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding a rational function P2021AMCB_16_answer such that when we evaluate g(1), where g is a polynomial with roots being the reciprocals of f's roots, we get P2021AMCB_16_answer a b c.

2. The ground truth answer is (1 + a + b + c)/c, which comes from:
   - For f(x) = x³ + ax² + bx + c, the sum of roots is -a (Vieta's)
   - The sum of reciprocals would be (sum of products of two roots)/(product of roots) = b/c
   - The polynomial g with reciprocal roots would be cx³ + bx² + ax + 1
   - Evaluating g(1) gives c + b + a + 1 = 1 + a + b + c
   - The ground truth answer divides this by c (normalizing leading coefficient to 1)

3. The proposed answer is a⁻¹ + b⁻¹ + c⁻¹ - 1, which doesn't match the correct derivation. It appears to be incorrectly combining the reciprocals of the coefficients rather than working with the roots.
