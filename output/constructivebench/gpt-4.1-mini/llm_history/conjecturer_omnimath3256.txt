The main issue is that Lean expects variables inside a set comprehension to be explicitly declared with a lambda or function. Also, Lean's set comprehensions are usually written as `{p : α | condition on p}` with a single variable `p`. We write `(x, y)` as a pair `p` and destruct it.

Also, exponentiation by `^` on real numbers in Lean uses `Real.pow` or `rpow` and not the natural number power notation with `^`. For integers, we use `x ^ 4` only if properly imported and for reals, it is typical to use `x ^ 4` if `open Real` is used, which is already the case.

The key is to write the set as

```
{p : ℝ × ℝ | let x := p.fst; let y := p.snd; x ≠ 0 ∧ y ≠ 0 ∧ ...}
```

This will fix the scope and the unknown identifier errors.

Also, the original question says the system is:

(1/x + 1/(2*y) = (x^2 + 3*y^2)*(3*x^2 + y^2)) ∧ (1/x - 1/(2*y) = 2*(y^4 - x^4))

From this, we can express:

1/x = [(x^2 + 3*y^2)*(3*x^2 + y^2) + 2*(y^4 - x^4)] / 2

and

1/(2*y) = [(x^2 + 3*y^2)*(3*x^2 + y^2) - 2*(y^4 - x^4)] / 2

So we can write inside the set:

x ≠ 0 ∧ y ≠ 0 ∧ 1/x = ( (x^2 + 3*y^2) * (3*x^2 + y^2) + 2*(y^4 - x^4) ) / 2 ∧ 1/(2*y) = ( (x^2 + 3*y^2) * (3*x^2 + y^2) - 2*(y^4 - x^4) ) / 2

This seems a cleaner expression and directly matches the original system.

This will be the final answer.

<<<
{ p : ℝ × ℝ | 
  let x := p.fst; 
  let y := p.snd; 
  x ≠ 0 ∧ y ≠ 0 ∧ 
  1/x = ((x^2 + 3*y^2) * (3*x^2 + y^2) + 2*(y^4 - x^4)) / 2 ∧ 
  1/(2*y) = ((x^2 + 3*y^2) * (3*x^2 + y^2) - 2*(y^4 - x^4)) / 2 
}
