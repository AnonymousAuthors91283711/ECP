Ground Truth Answer: (0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2)
Proposed Answer: (3, 0, 4, 1, 0, -2)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

The problem asks to find integer coefficients (a,b,c,d,e,f) such that the rational function (aR² + bR + c)/(dR² + eR + f) approximates 2^(1/3) better than R itself does, for all R ≥ 0.

The ground truth answer (0,2,2,1,0,2) gives the function (2R + 2)/(R² + 2). At R = 2^(1/3), this evaluates to (2*2^(1/3) + 2)/(2^(2/3) + 2), which indeed approximates 2^(1/3).

The proposed answer (3,0,4,1,0,-2) gives (3R² + 4)/(R² - 2). This has several problems:
1. The denominator becomes zero at R = √2, making the function undefined there
2. For R near √2, the function approaches ±∞, violating the approximation condition
3. Even where defined, it doesn't provide a better approximation than R itself
