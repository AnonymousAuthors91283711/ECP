Ground Truth Answer: 7
Proposed Answer: 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find a digit (0-9) that cannot be the last digit of (b! - a!) where 0 < a < b.

2. The ground truth answer is 7, meaning there are no natural numbers a, b with 0 < a < b where b! - a! ends with 7.

3. The proposed answer is 0, claiming that b! - a! can never end with 0.

Analysis:
- For b ≥ 5, both b! and a! end with 0 (since they contain factors of both 2 and 5), so their difference ends with 0.
- Example: 5! - 4! = 120 - 24 = 96 (ends with 6), but 6! - 5! = 720 - 120 = 600 (ends with 0)
- Therefore, 0 can indeed be the last digit of b! - a! (when b ≥ 6 and a ≥ 5)
- The digit 7 is indeed impossible as the last digit of such differences.

Conclusion: The proposed answer (0) is incorrect, while the ground truth (7) is correct.
