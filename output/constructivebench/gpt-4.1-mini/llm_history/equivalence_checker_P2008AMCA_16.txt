Ground Truth Answer: 112
Proposed Answer: 22
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a logarithmic sequence where the differences between terms form an arithmetic progression. We're asked to find the exponent P2008AMCA_16_answer such that the 12th term of the sequence equals log(b^P2008AMCA_16_answer).

2. From the given terms:
   - term1 = log(a³b⁷)
   - term2 = log(a⁵b¹²)
   - term3 = log(a⁸b¹⁵)

3. Calculating the common difference d:
   d = term2 - term1 = log(a²b⁵)

4. The 12th term would be:
   seq 12 = term1 + 11d = log(a³b⁷) + 11*log(a²b⁵) = log(a³b⁷ * (a²b⁵)¹¹) = log(a^{25}b^{62})

5. Therefore, the correct exponent for b is 62, not 112 or 22.

The ground truth answer (112) is incorrect, and the proposed answer (22) is also incorrect. However, since the question asks specifically about equivalence between the proposed answer and ground truth, and neither matches the correct solution:

<<<False>>>
