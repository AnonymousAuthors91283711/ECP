The error arises because Lean does not support the "for some a" phrase directly inside set notation. Instead, you should express the existential quantifier explicitly inside the set definition.

Also, to express "n * (k^2 - 1) = a^2 for some a", you should write ∃ a : ℕ, n * (k^2 - 1) = a^2.

Hence, the corrected and generalized version of the answer set should be:

<<<{ n : ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, k > 1 ∧ ∃ a : ℕ, n * (k^2 - 1) = a^2 }>>>
