theorem omnimath246 (m n : ℕ) (h : m ≥ n) :
    (m + n)! / (m - n)! = omnimath246_answer m n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun m n => ∏ i in Finset.Icc 1 n, (m^2 + m - i^2 + i)
Proposed Answer: fun m n => (Finset.Icc (m - n + 1) (m + n)).prod id
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: Product from i=1 to n of (m² + m - i² + i)
2. Proposed: Product from k=(m-n+1) to (m+n) of k

The proposed answer is simply (m-n+1)*(m-n+2)*...*(m+n), which is exactly the numerator (m+n)!/(m-n)! since:
(m+n)!/(m-n)! = (m+n)*(m+n-1)*...*(m-n+1)

The ground truth answer can be rewritten as:
∏[i=1 to n] [(m+i)(m+1-i)] = (m+1)*m*(m+2)*(m-1)*...*(m+n)*(m-n+1)

When you rearrange the terms, this becomes exactly the same as the proposed answer. Both expressions represent the same product, just written differently.
