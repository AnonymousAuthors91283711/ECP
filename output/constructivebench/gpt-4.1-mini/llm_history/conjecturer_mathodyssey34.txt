The problem asks for the greatest natural number \( k > 0 \) such that \( 1991^k \) divides \( 1990^{19911992} + 1992^{19911990} \).

Notice \(1991 = 1990 + 1 = 1992 - 1\). Using LTE lemma ideas or binomial expansion patterns, the highest power dividing sums of terms differing by 2 and powered closely suggests the answer is tied to the minimum exponent in the expansions.

After analysis, the greatest \( k \) is \( 1991 \).

<<<1991>>>
