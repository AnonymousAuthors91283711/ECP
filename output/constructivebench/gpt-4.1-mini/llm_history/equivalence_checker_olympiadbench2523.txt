theorem olympiadbench2523
: {(x, y) : ℝ × ℝ | x * (1 / 2 + y - 2 * x ^ 2) = 0 ∧ y * (5 / 2 + x - y) = 0} = olympiadbench2523_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0), (0, 5 / 2), (1 / 2, 0), (-1 / 2, 0), (3 / 2, 4), (-1, 3 / 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(x, y) | x = 0 ∧ (y = 0 ∨ y = 5 / 2)} ∪ {(x, y) | y = 0 ∧ (x = 0 ∨ y = 2 * x^2 - 1 / 2)}
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. The ground truth lists specific points that satisfy both equations.
2. The proposed answer provides a set description with:
   - First part: x=0 and y=0 or 5/2 (matches (0,0) and (0,5/2) from ground truth)
   - Second part: y=0 and x=0 or y=2x²-1/2 (but this is incorrect - it should be x=1/2 or -1/2 when y=0)

The proposed answer:
- Correctly captures the cases when x=0
- Incorrectly describes the cases when y=0 (it should be solving 1/2 + y - 2x² = 0 when y=0, giving x=±1/2)
- Misses the cases where neither x nor y is 0 (the points (3/2,4) and (-1,3/2) from ground truth)
