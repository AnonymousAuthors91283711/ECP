Ground Truth Answer: -150
Proposed Answer: -90
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have two equations:
   - (x - y)/(x + y) = 9
   - (x*y)/(x + y) = -60

2. We need to find the value of (x + y) + (x - y) + x*y

3. Simplifying the expression:
   (x + y) + (x - y) + x*y = 2x + x*y

4. From the first equation:
   x - y = 9(x + y) ⇒ x - y = 9x + 9y ⇒ -8x = 10y ⇒ y = -0.8x

5. From the second equation:
   x*y = -60(x + y)

6. Substituting y = -0.8x into x*y = -60(x + y):
   x*(-0.8x) = -60(x - 0.8x) ⇒ -0.8x² = -60(0.2x) ⇒ -0.8x² = -12x ⇒ 0.8x² - 12x = 0 ⇒ x(0.8x - 12) = 0

7. Solutions: x = 0 or x = 15
   - x = 0 leads to y = 0, which doesn't satisfy the original equations (division by zero)
   - x = 15 ⇒ y = -12

8. Calculating the expression:
   2x + x*y = 2*15 + 15*(-12) = 30 - 180 = -150

The ground truth answer is -150, while the proposed answer is -90. These are not equivalent.
