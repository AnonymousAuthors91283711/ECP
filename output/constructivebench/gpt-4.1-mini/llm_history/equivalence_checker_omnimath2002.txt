Ground Truth Answer: 8117
Proposed Answer: 4020
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives a functional equation f(x) + f(y) = f(x+1) + f(y-1) for all integers x,y, and two specific values f(2016)=6102 and f(6102)=2016.

2. The functional equation suggests that f is linear. Let's assume f(x) = ax + b.

3. Plugging into the equation:
   ax + b + ay + b = a(x+1) + b + a(y-1) + b
   Simplifies to: a(x + y) + 2b = a(x + y) + 2b
   Which holds for all a,b - meaning any linear function satisfies this.

4. Using the given values:
   f(2016) = 2016a + b = 6102
   f(6102) = 6102a + b = 2016

5. Solving these:
   Subtract second from first: (2016-6102)a = 6102-2016 => -4086a = 4086 => a = -1
   Then b = 6102 - 2016*(-1) = 6102 + 2016 = 8118

6. Therefore f(x) = -x + 8118
   So f(1) = -1 + 8118 = 8117

The ground truth answer (8117) matches this derivation exactly. The proposed answer (4020) does not match.
