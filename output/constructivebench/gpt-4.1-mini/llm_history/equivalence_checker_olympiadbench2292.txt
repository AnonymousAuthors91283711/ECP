Ground Truth Answer: {(3, 2), (-3, 2), (3, -2), (-3, -2)}
Proposed Answer: {(K, L) | (K = 3 ∧ L = 2) ∨ (K = 3 ∧ L = -2) ∨ (K = -3 ∧ L = 2) ∨ (K = -3 ∧ L = -2)}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both represent the same set of integer pairs (K, L) that satisfy the equation. The ground truth lists the pairs explicitly, while the proposed answer describes them using logical disjunctions, but they describe identical sets.
