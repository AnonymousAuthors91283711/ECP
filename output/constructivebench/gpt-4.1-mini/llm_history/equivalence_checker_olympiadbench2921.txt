theorem olympiadbench2921 :
  (∑ n in Finset.filter digitsMatch (Finset.range 10000), n) % 10000 = olympiadbench2921_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 6248
Proposed Answer: ∑ n in Finset.range (10000) |> Finset.filter (fun n =>
  let b2 := n.digits 2
  let b5 := n.digits 5
  b2.length ≥ 4 ∧ b5.length ≥ 4 ∧ b2.take 4 = b5.take 4), n
  % 10000

The proposed answer is structurally correct and matches the problem's requirements, but it doesn't provide the final numerical answer (6248) that the ground truth specifies. The proposed answer shows the correct summation setup but doesn't complete the calculation modulo 10000. Therefore, while the approach is correct, it's incomplete compared to the ground truth answer.
