abbrev omnimath2698_answer : â„š := sorry
theorem omnimath2698 : (20 + 16 * 20) / (20 * 16) = omnimath2698_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 17/16
Proposed Answer: 36/80
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is to simplify the rational expression (20 + 16 * 20) / (20 * 16)
2. Let's compute numerator and denominator:
   - Numerator: 20 + (16 * 20) = 20 + 320 = 340
   - Denominator: 20 * 16 = 320
3. So the fraction is 340/320
4. Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 20: 17/16 (ground truth answer)
5. Proposed answer is 36/80, which simplifies to 9/20 (dividing by 4)

The ground truth answer (17/16) and proposed answer (36/80) are clearly different fractions. The proposed answer is incorrect.
