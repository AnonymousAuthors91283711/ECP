Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 15
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest positive integer s such that there exist integers a, b, c where:
   - a*b*c = 60
   - a + b + c = s

2. The ground truth answer is 3. This can be achieved with:
   - (a, b, c) = (1, 5, 12) → 1*5*12=60, 1+5+12=18
   - (a, b, c) = (2, 3, 10) → 2*3*10=60, 2+3+10=15
   - (a, b, c) = (1, 6, 10) → 1*6*10=60, 1+6+10=17
   - (a, b, c) = (3, 4, 5) → 3*4*5=60, 3+4+5=12
   - (a, b, c) = (1, 4, 15) → 1*4*15=60, 1+4+15=20
   - (a, b, c) = (1, 3, 20) → 1*3*20=60, 1+3+20=24
   - (a, b, c) = (1, 2, 30) → 1*2*30=60, 1+2+30=33
   - (a, b, c) = (-1, -5, 12) → (-1)*(-5)*12=60, (-1)+(-5)+12=6
   - (a, b, c) = (-2, -3, 10) → (-2)*(-3)*10=60, (-2)+(-3)+10=5
   - (a, b, c) = (-1, -6, 10) → (-1)*(-6)*10=60, (-1)+(-6)+10=3

The minimal sum is indeed 3 (achieved with (-1, -6, 10)).

3. The proposed answer is 15, which is one of the possible sums (achieved with (2, 3, 10)), but not the minimal one.
