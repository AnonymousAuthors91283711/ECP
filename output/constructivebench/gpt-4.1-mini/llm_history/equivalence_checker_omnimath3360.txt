noncomputable abbrev omnimath3360_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3360 : 
  ∃! x, x * ⌊x * ⌊x * ⌊x * ⌊x⌋⌋⌋⌋ = 122 ∧ x = omnimath3360_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 122 / 41
Proposed Answer: (122 : ℝ)^(1 / 5)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a unique real number x that satisfies the nested floor equation x * ⌊x * ⌊x * ⌊x * ⌊x⌋⌋⌋⌋ = 122.

2. The ground truth answer is 122/41 ≈ 2.9756.

3. The proposed answer is the fifth root of 122 ≈ 2.6207.

Now let's test both answers:

For x = 122/41 ≈ 2.9756:
⌊x⌋ = 2
⌊x*2⌋ = ⌊5.9512⌋ = 5
⌊x*5⌋ = ⌊14.878⌋ = 14
⌊x*14⌋ = ⌊41.658⌋ = 41
x*41 = 122 (exactly matches the equation)

For x = 122^(1/5) ≈ 2.6207:
⌊x⌋ = 2
⌊x*2⌋ = ⌊5.2414⌋ = 5
⌊x*5⌋ = ⌊13.1035⌋ = 13
⌊x*13⌋ = ⌊34.0691⌋ = 34
x*34 ≈ 89.1038 ≠ 122

The proposed answer clearly doesn't satisfy the equation, while the ground truth does. They are not equivalent.
