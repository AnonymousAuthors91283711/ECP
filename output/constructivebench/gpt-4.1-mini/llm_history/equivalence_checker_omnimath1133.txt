Ground Truth Answer: fun totalRed totalBlue totalYellow numDrawn => 
    let redDrawn : ℕ := (numDrawn + 5) / 2
    let blueDrawn : ℕ := (numDrawn - 5) / 2
    let remainingRed := totalRed - redDrawn
    let remainingBlue := totalBlue - blueDrawn
    let remainingYellow := totalYellow - (numDrawn - redDrawn - blueDrawn)
    remainingRed / (remainingRed + remainingBlue + remainingYellow)
Proposed Answer: fun totalRed totalBlue totalYellow numDrawn => (9 : ℚ) / 26
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer (9/26) matches exactly with the conclusion of the theorem statement (omnimath1133_answer ... = 9/26). The ground truth answer shows the detailed calculation that would indeed result in 9/26 when the specific values from the theorem (totalRed=50, totalBlue=50, totalYellow=30, numDrawn=65) are plugged in. Therefore, the proposed answer is correct and equivalent to the ground truth answer for the given problem constraints.
