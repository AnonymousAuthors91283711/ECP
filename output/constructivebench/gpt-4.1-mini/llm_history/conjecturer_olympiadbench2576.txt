The problem describes the set of natural numbers \( n \) with \( 1 \leq n \leq 30 \) for which the set of positive divisors \( d \) common to \( n \) and 80 has exactly 2 elements. Since 80 = \(2^4 \cdot 5\), the gcd of \( n \) and 80 must have exactly two positive divisors, meaning the gcd is prime or prime power with exactly two divisors (1 and itself).

The divisors of 80 are \(1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 40, 80\).

We want numbers \( n \) where \( \gcd(n, 80) \) has exactly 2 positive divisors, so the gcd is prime—possible gcd values: 2 or 5 only (since powers > 1 have more than 2 divisors).

We find \( n \) such that gcd(n,80) = 2 or gcd(n,80) = 5.

Counting such \( n \) in \( [1,30] \):

- gcd(n,80) = 2 means 2 divides n, no higher powers of 2, and no 5 dividing n.

- gcd(n,80) = 5 means 5 divides n, and no 2 dividing n.

Counting these, the total number is 12.
