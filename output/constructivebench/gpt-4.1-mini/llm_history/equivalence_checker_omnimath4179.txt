Ground Truth Answer: {n | 6 ≤ n ∧ Even n}
Proposed Answer: { n | n ≥ 4 ∧ n % 2 = 0 }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but differs in the lower bound. The ground truth specifies n ≥ 6 (all even numbers from 6 onward), while the proposed answer includes n = 4 (which may or may not satisfy the original problem's conditions). The evenness condition (n % 2 = 0) matches in both answers. Without knowing whether n=4 is valid in the original problem, we can only say the answers are close but not exactly equivalent.
