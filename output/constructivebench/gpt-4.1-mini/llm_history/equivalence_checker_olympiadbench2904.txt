Ground Truth Answer: fun (A, B) => (15 * (1800 / 20) * (1/B) / (1/A))
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℚ × ℚ => (1 / p.1 + 1 / p.2) * 150
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us A = 1/9 and B = 1/25, and asks for a function that returns 3750 when applied to (A, B).

2. Ground Truth Answer:
   - When we plug in A=1/9, B=1/25:
   - (15 * (1800/20) * (1/B) / (1/A)) = (15 * 90 * 25 * 9) = 15 * 90 * 225 = 303750 (which doesn't match 3750)

3. Proposed Answer:
   - When we plug in A=1/9, B=1/25:
   - (1/(1/9) + 1/(1/25)) * 150 = (9 + 25) * 150 = 34 * 150 = 5100 (which also doesn't match 3750)

However, both answers are incorrect for the given problem since neither evaluates to 3750 with the given inputs. But the problem asks whether they're equivalent to each other, not whether they solve the problem correctly.

Let's test if they're equivalent functions:
- The ground truth simplifies to: 15 * 90 * (1/B)/(1/A) = 1350 * (A/B)
- The proposed answer is: (A⁻¹ + B⁻¹) * 150 = 150*(A+B)/(A*B)

These are clearly different functions. For example:
- For A=1, B=1:
  - Ground truth: 1350 * (1/1) = 1350
  - Proposed: 150*(2)/1 = 300
