  let T := 7
  let K := 9 * T
  A K = olympiadbench2775_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 21
Proposed Answer: 9 * 7 + 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive function A(n) where:
   - A(0) = 0
   - A(1) = 2
   - For n+1, if n+1 is a perfect square, A(n+1) = sqrt(n+1), else A(n+1) = A(n) + 1

2. We're asked to compute A(K) where K = 9*7 = 63

3. The ground truth answer is 21, which suggests that A(63) = 21

4. The proposed answer is 9*7 + 7 = 70, which is clearly different from 21

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth and doesn't appear to follow the recursive definition of A(n). The calculation 9*7 + 7 doesn't relate to the problem's definition of A(n).
