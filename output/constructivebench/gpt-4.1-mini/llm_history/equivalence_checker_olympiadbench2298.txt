Ground Truth Answer: {x : ℝ | (0 < (x ^ 2 - 11) / (x + 1) ∧ (x ^ 2 - 11) / (x + 1) < 7) ∧ x + 1 ≠ 0}
Proposed Answer: {x : ℝ | x ≠ -1 ∧ 0 < (x^2 - 11) / (x + 1) ∧ (x^2 - 11) / (x + 1) < 7}
<<<True>>>

The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both expressions describe the same set of real numbers x where:
1. x ≠ -1 (to avoid division by zero)
2. The inequality 0 < (x² - 11)/(x + 1) holds
3. The inequality (x² - 11)/(x + 1) < 7 holds

The only difference is the order of conditions and the grouping of inequalities, which doesn't affect the meaning. The proposed answer explicitly states x ≠ -1 first, while the ground truth includes it as part of the conjunction, but they are logically equivalent.
