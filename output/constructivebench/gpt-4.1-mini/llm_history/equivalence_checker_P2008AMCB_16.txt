Ground Truth Answer: {(4, 6), (5, 12)}
Proposed Answer: { (a, b) : ℕ × ℕ | a > 0 ∧ b > a ∧ ∃ x y : ℕ, x = a - 2 ∧ y = b - 2 ∧ 2 ∣ a * b ∧ x * y = a * b / 2 }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a set of natural number pairs (a,b) where b > a > 0, and there exist x,y such that:
   - x = a - 2
   - y = b - 2
   - x*y = (a*b)/2
   - a*b is divisible by 2

2. The ground truth answer explicitly lists the solutions: (4,6) and (5,12)

3. The proposed answer gives a set comprehension that exactly matches the problem's conditions:
   - a > 0 ∧ b > a
   - ∃ x y with x = a-2 ∧ y = b-2
   - 2 ∣ a*b
   - x*y = a*b/2

The proposed answer is mathematically equivalent to the problem statement and would yield exactly the same solutions as the ground truth answer. The set comprehension form is just a more general way of expressing the same condition that produces {(4,6), (5,12)}.
