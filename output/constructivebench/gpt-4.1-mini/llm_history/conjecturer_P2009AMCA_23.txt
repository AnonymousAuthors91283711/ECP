The error occurs because Real.sqrt is noncomputable and you need to mark the definition as noncomputable for Lean to accept it.

Also, to express the answer as m + n * sqrt p, where m, n, p ∈ ℕ and p is squarefree, typically you want to represent it as an expression involving natural numbers and Real.sqrt p in ℝ, marking it as noncomputable.

Hence the fix is to mark the abbreviation as noncomputable.

The error arises because `Real.sqrt` is not computable in Lean's default setting, so Lean requires the definition to be marked as `noncomputable` when it depends on `Real.sqrt`.

Since your `P2009AMCA_23_answer` is defined as a real number involving a square root, you should mark the abbreviation as `noncomputable` to avoid the compilation error.

Also, to better fit the problem statement where the answer is expressed as `m + n * sqrt p` with `m, n, p : ℕ`, and `Squarefree p`, it is better to keep the answer in that form explicitly, e.g. `352 + 56 * Real.sqrt 19`, which matches `m=352, n=56, p=19`.

Therefore, the fix is simply to mark your abbreviation as `noncomputable` and assign the real value.
