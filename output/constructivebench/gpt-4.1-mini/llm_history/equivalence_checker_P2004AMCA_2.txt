  IsLeast {n : ℕ | n ≤ 17 ∧ n * 6 + 8 * 5 / 2 ≥ 100} P2004AMCA_2_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 14
Proposed Answer: 17
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n ≤ 17 that satisfies n*6 + 8*5/2 ≥ 100.

2. Calculating the expression:
   - 8*5/2 = 20
   - So the inequality becomes n*6 + 20 ≥ 100 → n*6 ≥ 80 → n ≥ 80/6 ≈ 13.333

3. Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer satisfying n ≥ 13.333 is 14.

4. The ground truth answer is 14, which is correct.

5. The proposed answer is 17, which:
   - Does satisfy the inequality (17*6 + 20 = 122 ≥ 100)
   - Is within the bound (17 ≤ 17)
   - But is not the least such number (14 is smaller and also satisfies the conditions)

The proposed answer is incorrect because while it satisfies the conditions, it's not the smallest such number.
