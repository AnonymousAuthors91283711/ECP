Ground Truth Answer: 2^22
Proposed Answer: 111 - 66 + 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of distinct functions (k) that can be assigned to dwarves under certain constraints. This is essentially a combinatorics problem about distinct function assignments.

2. The ground truth answer is 2^22, which suggests this is related to binary assignments or power sets (a common combinatorial result).

3. The proposed answer is 111 - 66 + 1 = 46, which appears to be a simple arithmetic calculation without any combinatorial reasoning.

4. The two answers are vastly different (4,194,304 vs 46) and there's no apparent transformation that would make them equivalent.

5. The proposed answer doesn't show any connection to the combinatorial nature of the problem or the constraints given.
