theorem omnimath4347 (n : ℕ) (h : 10 < n ∧ n < 20) :
    (∃ k : ℕ, 4 * k + 5 * k = n^2 ∧ n^2 % 9 = 0) ↔ n ∈ omnimath4347_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {12, 15, 18}
Proposed Answer: {n | 10 < n ∧ n < 20 ∧ ∃ k : ℕ, 9 * k = n^2}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for natural numbers n between 10 and 20 where:
   - There exists a k such that 4k + 5k = n² (which simplifies to 9k = n²)
   - n² is divisible by 9 (n² % 9 = 0)

2. The ground truth answer gives the explicit set {12, 15, 18}

3. The proposed answer gives a set builder notation equivalent to:
   {n | 10 < n < 20 ∧ ∃ k : ℕ, 9k = n²}

The proposed answer is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth because:
- 9k = n² is exactly the condition that n² is divisible by 9 (since k would be n²/9)
- The bounds 10 < n < 20 are the same
- The numbers satisfying these conditions between 10 and 20 are exactly 12, 15, 18 (since:
  12²=144=9×16
  15²=225=9×25
  18²=324=9×36)
