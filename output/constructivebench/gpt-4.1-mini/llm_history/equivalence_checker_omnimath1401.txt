Ground Truth Answer: 36
Proposed Answer: 18
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting maximum independent sets in a grid graph (10×2 grid, based on the adjacency definition).

2. The adjacency condition defines that two points are adjacent if they are either:
   - In the same column (p.1 = q.1) and adjacent rows (|p.2 - q.2| = 1), or
   - In the same row (p.2 = q.2) and adjacent columns (|p.1 - q.1| = 1)

3. We're looking for subsets of size 9 where no two elements are adjacent (nonnadj).

4. In a 10×2 grid (20 points total), a maximum independent set would indeed be size 10 (taking every other point in a checkerboard pattern). However, the problem asks for size 9 sets.

5. The ground truth answer is 36, which makes sense because:
   - For each pair of columns, we can choose one column to have 5 points and the other to have 4 points
   - There are 2 choices for which column gets 5 points
   - For the column with 5 points, there are 2 independent set configurations (starting with first or second point)
   - For the column with 4 points, there are 9 configurations (any 4 points where no two are adjacent)
   - Total: 2 (column choices) × 2 (5-point configs) × 9 (4-point configs) = 36

6. The proposed answer is 18, which is exactly half of the correct answer. This suggests they might have missed one of the factors (either the column choice or the 5-point configurations).
