Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We're given:
   - a ≠ b
   - (a + b)/(a - b) = 3
   - Need to find a/b

2. Solving the equation:
   (a + b)/(a - b) = 3
   => a + b = 3(a - b)
   => a + b = 3a - 3b
   => b + 3b = 3a - a
   => 4b = 2a
   => a/b = 2

The ground truth answer (2) is correct, while the proposed answer (4) is incorrect. The correct ratio a/b is indeed 2, not 4.

<<<False>>>
