  omnimath3431_answer ∉ {m : ℤ | ∃ n : ℤ, ∀ x : ℤ, (x + m) * (x + n) = x^2 + (m + n) * x + m * n ∧ m * n = -12} := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 5
Proposed Answer: -12
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find an integer m that does NOT satisfy the condition where there exists some integer n such that:
   - (x + m)(x + n) expands to x² + (m+n)x + mn for all x (which is always true by algebra)
   - m * n = -12

2. The ground truth answer is 5, meaning that there is no integer n such that 5 * n = -12.

3. The proposed answer is -12. Let's check if -12 could work:
   - We'd need n such that -12 * n = -12 ⇒ n = 1
   - With m = -12 and n = 1, the conditions are satisfied
   - Therefore, -12 is IN the set, but the problem asks for a number NOT in the set

The proposed answer is exactly the opposite of what's being asked for. The ground truth correctly identifies a number not in the set, while the proposed answer gives a number that is in the set.
