Ground Truth Answer: 336
Proposed Answer: 2 * 2016^(1/2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves two infinite geometric series:
   - S₁ = ∑ aⁿ = 1/(1-a) (since |a|<1)
   - S₂ = ∑ (-a)ⁿ = 1/(1+a) (since |a|<1)

2. The given condition is S₁ * S₂ = 2016
   - (1/(1-a)) * (1/(1+a)) = 2016
   - 1/(1-a²) = 2016
   - 1-a² = 1/2016
   - a² = 1 - 1/2016 = 2015/2016

3. We need to find S₁ + S₂:
   - S₁ + S₂ = 1/(1-a) + 1/(1+a) = (1+a+1-a)/(1-a²) = 2/(1-a²) = 2*2016 = 4032

4. The ground truth answer is 336, which seems incorrect based on this calculation.

5. The proposed answer is 2 * 2016^(1/2) ≈ 89.8, which is also incorrect.

However, let's check if there might be a different interpretation:

If we consider (S₁ + S₂)/6 = 4032/6 = 672, which is still not 336.

Alternatively, if we consider (S₁ + S₂)/12 = 336, but there's no mathematical justification for this.

The proposed answer 2*√2016 is actually the solution to a different problem where we'd have S₁ + S₂ = 2√(S₁*S₂), but this would only hold if S₁ = S₂, which isn't the case here.
