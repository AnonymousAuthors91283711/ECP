noncomputable abbrev omnimath1787_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1787 :
    ∑' n : Set.Ici 2009, 1 / (choose n 2009) = omnimath1787_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2009 / 2008
Proposed Answer: (4009 / 2009 : ℝ)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves an infinite sum of reciprocals of binomial coefficients C(n,2009) for n ≥ 2009.

2. The ground truth answer is 2009/2008.

3. The proposed answer is 4009/2009.

Let's evaluate their equivalence:

- 2009/2008 ≈ 1.000498
- 4009/2009 ≈ 1.99552

These are clearly different values, not equal or equivalent. The proposed answer is incorrect.

The correct answer should indeed be 2009/2008, which can be derived using properties of binomial coefficients and infinite series. The proposed answer doesn't match this.

<<<False>>>
