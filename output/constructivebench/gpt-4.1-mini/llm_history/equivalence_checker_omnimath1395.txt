Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1), (2, 2^2017)}
Proposed Answer: { (a, b) | 0 < a ∧ 0 < b ∧ ∃ k : ℕ, b = a * k ∧ k ∣ a^2016 + 1 }
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground Truth: Explicitly lists two pairs (1,1) and (2,2^2017)
Proposed Answer: Provides a general condition for pairs (a,b)

Let's test the ground truth pairs against the proposed condition:

1. For (1,1):
   - b = 1 = 1*k ⇒ k=1
   - Check if 1 | 1^2016 + 1 ⇒ 1 | 2 ⇒ true
   - So (1,1) satisfies the proposed condition

2. For (2,2^2017):
   - b = 2^2017 = 2*k ⇒ k=2^2016
   - Check if 2^2016 | 2^2016 + 1 ⇒ false
   - So (2,2^2017) doesn't satisfy the proposed condition

The proposed answer correctly includes (1,1) but incorrectly excludes (2,2^2017). The condition fails to capture the second case where b = a^k with a special relationship.

<<<False>>>
