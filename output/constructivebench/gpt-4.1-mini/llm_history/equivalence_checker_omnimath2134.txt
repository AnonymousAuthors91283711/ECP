abbrev omnimath2134_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2134 :
  GCDMonoid.gcd (4 ^ 8 - 1) (8 ^ 12 - 1) = omnimath2134_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 15
Proposed Answer: (4 ^ 4 - 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for gcd(4⁸-1, 8¹²-1)
2. Ground truth answer: 15
3. Proposed answer: (4⁴-1) = 256-1 = 255

Now let's evaluate:
- gcd(4⁸-1, 8¹²-1) = gcd(65535, 68719476735)
- Factorizing these:
  - 65535 = 3×5×17×257
  - 68719476735 = 3×5×17×257×65537
- The common factors are 3×5×17×257 = 65535
- But 65535 is 255 (4⁴-1), not 15

The proposed answer gives 255, but the correct gcd is 15. They are not equivalent.
