abbrev omnimath647_answer : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath647 (a b : ℝ) :
    Collinear ℝ ({![1, a, b], ![a, 2, b], ![a, b, 3]} : Set (Fin 3 → ℝ)) ↔ omnimath647_answer (a, b) = 4 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun (a, b) => a + b
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℝ × ℝ => p.1 * p.2 + 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about collinearity of three vectors in ℝ³. The condition for collinearity is that the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors must be zero.

2. The vectors given are:
   - [1, a, b]
   - [a, 2, b]
   - [a, b, 3]

3. The determinant condition would be:
   |1 a a|
   |a 2 b| = 0
   |b b 3|

4. Calculating this determinant gives:
   1*(6 - b²) - a*(3a - b²) + a*(ab - 2b) = 0
   Simplifying: 6 - b² - 3a² + ab² + a²b - 2ab = 0

5. The ground truth answer suggests that the condition simplifies to a + b = 4.

6. The proposed answer suggests a*b + 1 = 4.

Comparing these:
- The ground truth answer (a + b = 4) is correct for the collinearity condition.
- The proposed answer (a*b + 1 = 4) is different and incorrect.
