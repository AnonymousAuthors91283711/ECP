Ground Truth Answer: 398
Proposed Answer: (range 11).sum (fun n => (2^(10 - n) - 1) * 2^n) % 1000
Let me analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem is calculating:
1. All pairs (a,b) where a,b are powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^10
2. Filtering to keep only pairs where a > b
3. Summing all (a-b) differences
4. Finding this sum modulo 1000

The ground truth is 398.

The proposed answer suggests a different approach:
- For each n from 0 to 10, it calculates (2^(10-n) - 1)*2^n
- Sums these values and takes modulo 1000

Let's verify if these are equivalent:

Original approach counts all pairs where a > b. For a given b = 2^k, the possible a values are 2^{k+1} to 2^10. The sum of (a-b) for fixed b is:
sum_{m=k+1}^{10} (2^m - 2^k) = (2^{10+1} - 2^{k+1}) - (10-k)*2^k

The proposed answer's term for n=k is:
(2^{10-k} - 1)*2^k = 2^10 - 2^k

This doesn't match the original calculation. The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It doesn't properly account for all pairs where a > b
2. The formula doesn't match the combinatorial interpretation
