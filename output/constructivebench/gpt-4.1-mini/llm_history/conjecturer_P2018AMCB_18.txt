The problem states the recurrence of the well-known Fibonacci sequence shifted to have f(1) = 1 and f(2) = 1, and for n ≥ 3, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). The value of f(2018) equals the 2018-th Fibonacci number under that definition. 

The error is that the identifier fibo is unknown. We can use Lean's built-in `Nat.fib` function, which defines the Fibonacci sequence as fib 0 = 0, fib 1 = 1, and fib (n+2) = fib (n+1) + fib n. Note that f here is shifted by one from Lean's fib because our f(1) = 1 corresponds to fib 1 = 1, f(2) = 1 corresponds to fib 2 = 1 (which Lean's fib 2 = 1).

Therefore, f(n) = fib n for all n ≥ 1 by matching initial values. Thus we can replace fibo 2018 by Nat.fib 2018.
