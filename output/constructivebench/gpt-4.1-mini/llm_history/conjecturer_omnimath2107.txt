The error occurs because the set comprehension uses a variable k that is not introduced in the scope. To fix this, we can use an existential quantifier inside the set definition to bind k. In Lean, this is done by saying there exists k such that conditions hold. So the set is all n for which there exists k > 0 with n = 3^k and k divisible by 3.

Hence, the corrected definition is:

{ n : ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, 0 < k ∧ k % 3 = 0 ∧ n = 3 ^ k }

This adds the binding of k properly, resolving the unknown variable errors.
