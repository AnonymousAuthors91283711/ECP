Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | n ≥ 1}
Proposed Answer: {n | n ≥ 1}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer {n | n ≥ 1} is equivalent to the ground truth answer {n : ℕ | n ≥ 1} since they both describe the same set of natural numbers greater than or equal to 1. The type annotation ℕ in the ground truth is implied in the proposed answer as the problem context is about natural numbers.
