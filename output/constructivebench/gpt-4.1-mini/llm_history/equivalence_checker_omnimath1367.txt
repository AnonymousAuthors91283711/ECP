Ground Truth Answer: fun x => x^7 + 64 * x^2
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℝ => (x^2 + 4)^3
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem: We need to find a function f(x) such that when x satisfies x³ + 4x = 8, then f(x) = 128.

Ground Truth: f(x) = x⁷ + 64x²
Proposed: f(x) = (x² + 4)³

Let's verify if they are equivalent under the constraint x³ + 4x = 8:

1. Expand the proposed answer:
(x² + 4)³ = x⁶ + 12x⁴ + 48x² + 64

2. Using the constraint x³ = 8 - 4x:
x⁶ = (x³)² = (8 - 4x)² = 64 - 64x + 16x²
x⁴ = x(x³) = x(8 - 4x) = 8x - 4x²

Substitute into proposed answer:
= (64 - 64x + 16x²) + 12(8x - 4x²) + 48x² + 64
= 64 - 64x + 16x² + 96x - 48x² + 48x² + 64
= (64 + 64) + (-64x + 96x) + (16x² - 48x² + 48x²)
= 128 + 32x + 16x²

This doesn't simplify to 128 for all x satisfying the constraint.

Now check ground truth:
x⁷ + 64x² = x(x⁶) + 64x²
= x(64 - 64x + 16x²) + 64x²
= 64x - 64x² + 16x³ + 64x²
= 64x + 16x³
= 16(x³ + 4x) = 16*8 = 128

The ground truth correctly evaluates to 128 under the constraint, while the proposed answer doesn't.

<<<False>>>
