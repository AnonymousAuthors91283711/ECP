The problem is to find the minimum value of the expression \(x^2 + 16y^2\) subject to the linear constraint \(3x + 4y = 10\).

Geometrically, this is finding the point on the line \(3x + 4y = 10\) closest to the origin in the weighted norm with weights 1 and 16 on \(x\) and \(y\), respectively.

Using Lagrange multipliers or by substitution:

- From constraint: \(y = \frac{10 - 3x}{4}\)
- Objective: \(f(x) = x^2 + 16\left(\frac{10 - 3x}{4}\right)^2 = x^2 + \left(10 - 3x\right)^2\)
- Expanding: \(f(x) = x^2 + 100 - 60x + 9x^2 = 10x^2 - 60x + 100\).
- Minimizing w.r.t. \(x\) yields \(20x - 60 = 0 \implies x = 3\).
- Substitute back: \(y = \frac{10 - 3*3}{4} = \frac{10 - 9}{4} = \frac{1}{4}\).
- Objective minimal value: \(3^2 + 16 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 = 9 + 16 \cdot \frac{1}{16} = 9 + 1 = 10\).

Hence, the minimal value is 10.

**Regarding the Lean error message about non-computable real division and definition**, the answer should be marked `noncomputable` if you want to define it explicitly using division on real numbers. Given this is a minimal real value, it is natural for it to be noncomputable.

Therefore, in Lean, write:

```lean
noncomputable abbrev olympiadbench2342_answer : ℝ := 10
```

This removes the error.

The problem is to find the minimum of x² + 16y² subject to the linear constraint 3x + 4y = 10.

By the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality or standard Lagrange multipliers, the minimum occurs when the vectors (x,4y) and (3,4) are proportional, giving the minimum value:

(x² + 16y²)^(1/2) * (3² + 4²)^(1/2) ≥ |3x + 4y| = 10,

so

√(x² +16 y²) * 5 ≥ 10 → √(x² + 16y²) ≥ 2 → x² +16 y² ≥ 4.

Equality is attained at

(x,y) = λ(3,4) with 3λ + 4λ = 7λ =10 → λ = 10/7,

x = 30/7, y =40/7,

and minimum value is (30/7)² +16 (40/7)²

= (900/49) +16 (1600/49) = (900/49) + (25600/49) = 26500/49.

Therefore, the minimum is 26500/49.

Hence the final answer is 26500 / 49 as a real number.

Also, in Lean, abbreviations cannot be marked noncomputable directly in the same line. Place the attribute separately or write def/let with noncomputable.

So the correct definition is just

abbrev olympiadbench2342_answer : ℝ := 26500 / 49

and no "noncomputable" is needed.

The problem is essentially to minimize \(x^2 + 16 y^2\) subject to the linear constraint \(3x + 4y = 10\). The expression is a positive definite quadratic form, and the set \(\{z : \exists x,y, P x y \wedge z = x^2 + 16 y^2\}\) corresponds to the values attained by this quadratic form on the line defined by \(3x + 4y = 10\).

To solve this, consider the method of Lagrange multipliers or simply use calculus:

1. Solve \(3x + 4y = 10\) for \(y\): \(y = \frac{10 - 3x}{4}\).
2. Substitute into the quadratic form: 
\[
f(x) = x^2 + 16 \left(\frac{10 - 3x}{4}\right)^2 = x^2 + 16 \cdot \frac{(10 - 3x)^2}{16} = x^2 + (10 - 3x)^2.
\]
3. Minimize \(f(x) = x^2 + (10 - 3x)^2\).

Expand:
\[
f(x) = x^2 + 100 - 60x + 9x^2 = 10x^2 - 60x + 100.
\]

Derivative:
\[
f'(x) = 20x - 60 = 0 \implies x = 3.
\]

Back-substitute \(x=3\) into the constraint to find \(y\):
\[
3(3) + 4y = 10 \implies 9 + 4y = 10 \implies y = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Compute \(f(3)\):
\[
3^2 + 16 \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 = 9 + 16 \cdot \frac{1}{16} = 9 + 1 = 10.
\]

Hence the minimum is \(10\).

The candidate answer \(26500/49 \approx 540.82\) is far too large, so replacing this with the correct minimal value \(10\).

Regarding the Lean error message about the real division and the noncomputable keyword: Since the answer is a closed-form rational (converted to real), marking the abbreviation `noncomputable` solves the error, but since the solution is just a real number, we can directly set it to `10`.

Final answer in Lean:

<<<10>>>
