Ground Truth Answer: fun (x, y) => 
    let x1 := x + y
    let x2 := x1 * y
    let y3 := y + 1
    let x4 := x2 + y3
    let x5 := x4 * y3
    let y6 := y3 + 1
    x5
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℕ × ℕ => p.1 * p.2^2 + p.2 * p.1^2
Let's analyze both answers step by step.

Ground Truth Answer:
1. x1 = x + y
2. x2 = x1 * y = (x + y)*y
3. y3 = y + 1
4. x4 = x2 + y3 = (x + y)*y + (y + 1)
5. x5 = x4 * y3 = [(x + y)*y + (y + 1)]*(y + 1)
6. y6 = y3 + 1 = y + 2 (not used)
Final expression: [(x + y)*y + (y + 1)]*(y + 1)

Proposed Answer: p.1 * p.2^2 + p.2 * p.1^2 = x*y² + y*x²

Let's test with (10,2):
Ground Truth:
[(10+2)*2 + (2+1)]*(2+1) = [24 + 3]*3 = 81
But the theorem states olympiadbench2325_answer (10, 2) = 340, which contradicts.

Proposed Answer:
10*2² + 2*10² = 40 + 200 = 240 ≠ 340

Neither answer matches the given theorem value of 340. However, the proposed answer is clearly different from the ground truth answer in both form and computed value.
