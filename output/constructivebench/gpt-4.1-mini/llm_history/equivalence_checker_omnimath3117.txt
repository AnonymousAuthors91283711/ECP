Ground Truth Answer: 1 / 2
Proposed Answer: -1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a set of pairs (x,y) where x ∈ [-4,-2] and y ∈ [2,4]
2. We're looking to maximize (x + y)/x = 1 + y/x
3. Since x is negative and y is positive, y/x is negative
4. To maximize 1 + y/x, we need to maximize y/x (make it least negative)
5. This occurs when y is smallest and x is largest (in absolute value)
   - Minimum y = 2
   - Maximum x = -2 (since x ≤ -2)
6. Thus maximum value = (2 + (-2))/(-2) = 0/(-2) = 0

However, the ground truth answer is 1/2 and proposed answer is -1. Neither matches our calculation. The correct maximum should actually be:
- For x = -4, y = 2: (-4 + 2)/(-4) = (-2)/(-4) = 1/2
This matches the ground truth answer.

The proposed answer (-1) is incorrect as:
- For x = -2, y = 4: (-2 + 4)/(-2) = 2/(-2) = -1
But this is not the maximum.
