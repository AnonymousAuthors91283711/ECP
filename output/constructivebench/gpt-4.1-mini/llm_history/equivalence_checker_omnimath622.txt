Ground Truth Answer: 16
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the greatest integer d that can be expressed as the discriminant (b² - 4ac) of a quadratic polynomial f(x) = ax² + bx + c with three distinct integer roots where f takes values 0 at two points and 2 at another.

2. The ground truth answer is 16. This makes sense because:
   - For a quadratic to have three distinct points with f(u)=0, f(v)=0, f(w)=2, it must actually be a linear function (a=0)
   - The maximum discriminant occurs when the slope is maximized to give distinct integer points
   - The case f(x) = ±2x + 2 gives points (0,2), (1,0), (-1,0) with "discriminant" 4 (since a=0, it's really just b²)
   - However, with a=0, the discriminant formula reduces to b², and the maximum perfect square difference we can get is 16 (from f(x) = ±4x + 4)

3. The proposed answer is 8, which is not a perfect square and cannot be obtained as b² when a=0.

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- 8 cannot be expressed as b² for integer b
- The maximum possible value is indeed 16
