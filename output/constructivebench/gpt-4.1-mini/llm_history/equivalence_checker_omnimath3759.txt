Ground Truth Answer: fun n => if n = 0 then 0 else 2
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the rank of a specific n×n matrix A where A_ij = (i+1) + (j+1) when cast to rational numbers.

2. The ground truth answer correctly handles the special case when n=0 (rank is 0) and otherwise gives rank 2. This makes sense because:
   - For n=0, the matrix is empty (0×0), so rank is 0
   - For n>0, the matrix can be written as outer product of two vectors [2,3,...,n+1] and [1,1,...,1] plus [1,1,...,1] and [2,3,...,n+1], resulting in rank ≤ 2
   - The rank is exactly 2 for n≥1 since the first two rows/columns are linearly independent

3. The proposed answer always returns 2, which is incorrect for n=0 case.

The proposed answer is mostly correct but fails on the n=0 case, so I return "Close" rather than "True". The answers are not fully equivalent.
