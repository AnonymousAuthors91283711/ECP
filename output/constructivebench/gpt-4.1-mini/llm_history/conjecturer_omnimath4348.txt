The error arises because the notation `t⁻³` is invalid in Lean source. Instead, exponentiation with negative integers should be written as `t ^ (-3 : ℤ)`. Furthermore, the relation given connects each variable to the next cyclically via the equation t + t⁻³ = 2 * next_variable, not t + t⁻³ = 2 * t. However, all four equations are symmetric and cyclic, which suggests that \( x = y = z = w \) and that each must satisfy \( t + t^{-3} = 2 \cdot t \).

Rearranging the equation \( t + t^{-3} = 2t \) becomes \( t^{-3} = t \), or equivalently \( t^4 = 1 \). Over the reals and \( t \neq 0 \), this means \( t = 1 \) or \( t = -1 \). Substituting back into the original to check which satisfies \( t + t^{-3} = 2t \):

- For \( t=1 \), \( 1 + 1 = 2 = 2 \cdot 1 \), valid.
- For \( t=-1 \), \( -1 + (-1)^{-3} = -1 + (-1) = -2 \neq 2 \cdot (-1) = -2 \), matches as well.

But carefully checking the cycles suggests \( t=1 \) must be the solution because \( y = z = w = x \).

Hence, the answer set contains all 4-tuples where \( x=y=z=w \) and \( t^4 =1 \), \( t \neq 0 \), i.e., \( t=1 \) or \( t=-1 \). In Lean let’s write that.
