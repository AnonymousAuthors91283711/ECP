Ground Truth Answer: (1/3, -2, 5)
Proposed Answer: (1/2, 1, 6)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is a system of equations involving logarithmic functions with base a, where a > 0 and a ≠ 1.

2. The ground truth answer (1/3, -2, 5) satisfies all three equations:
   - log_(1/3)(3 + (-2)) + 5 = log_(1/3)(1) + 5 = 0 + 5 = 5
   - log_(1/3)(5 + (-2)) + 5 = log_(1/3)(3) + 5 = -1 + 5 = 4
   - log_(1/3)(11 + (-2)) + 5 = log_(1/3)(9) + 5 = -2 + 5 = 3

3. The proposed answer (1/2, 1, 6) does not satisfy the equations:
   - log_(1/2)(3 + 1) + 6 = log_(1/2)(4) + 6 = -2 + 6 = 4 ≠ 5 (first equation fails)
   - The other equations would also fail to match.

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy any of the given equations, while the ground truth answer satisfies all of them.
