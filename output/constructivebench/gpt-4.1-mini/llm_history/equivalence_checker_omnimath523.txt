Ground Truth Answer: (2 * Complex.I - 1) / 4
Proposed Answer: (1 : ℂ) / ((1 - 2 * Complex.I) - 1)^2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves evaluating an infinite series S = Σ (n+1)/z^(n+1) where z = 1-2i.

2. The ground truth answer is (2i - 1)/4.

3. The proposed answer is 1/((1-2i - 1)^2) = 1/(-2i)^2 = 1/(-4) = -1/4.

Comparing these:
- Ground truth: (2i - 1)/4 = -1/4 + i/2
- Proposed: -1/4

The proposed answer only captures the real part correctly but misses the imaginary part completely. The answers are not equivalent.
