Ground Truth Answer: 24/5
Proposed Answer: -3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives a cubic polynomial f(x) with known values at x=2,3,4 (4,9,16 respectively).
2. It also provides additional conditions about points D,E,F that lie on secant lines between these points.
3. The ground truth answer is 24/5 (4.8).
4. The proposed answer is -3.

The proposed answer (-3) is significantly different from the ground truth (24/5). For a cubic polynomial fitting these conditions, f(0) cannot be both 24/5 and -3 simultaneously.
