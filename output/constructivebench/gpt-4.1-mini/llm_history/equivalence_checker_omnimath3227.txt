Ground Truth Answer: 13725
Proposed Answer: 2016
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating the real part of a complex logarithm of a product of terms involving roots of unity, then dividing by log(2).

2. The ground truth answer is 13725, which suggests this is a carefully calculated result based on properties of roots of unity and logarithms.

3. The proposed answer is 2016, which is suspiciously close to the year this problem might have been posed (2015 in the problem statement), suggesting it might be a guess rather than a calculated result.

4. The product involves terms of the form (1 + exp(2πiab/2015)), which are related to roots of unity. The correct evaluation would require understanding how these terms multiply together and their real parts.

5. There's no obvious mathematical relationship between 2016 and the structure of the problem that would make this answer correct.
