The problem is to find the sum of the reciprocals of the positive divisors of 144, expressed as a rational number in Lean. The original attempt incorrectly treats the set of divisors as a Finset and also assigns a proposition to a ℚ type. To fix the issues:

1. Define the divisors using `finset` available for naturals with `finset.filter` on the divisors of 144.
2. Sum over that finset, the reciprocals as rationals.
3. The value is a rational number.
4. Provide the simplified answer as a rational number 168/144, which reduces to 7/6.

Hence, the correct closed-form in Lean is:

<<<
168 / 144
>>>
