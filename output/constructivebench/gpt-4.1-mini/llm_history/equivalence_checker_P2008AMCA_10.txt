noncomputable abbrev P2008AMCA_10_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem P2008AMCA_10 (t : ℝ) :
  (1/5 + 1/7) * (t - 1) = 1 ↔ P2008AMCA_10_answer t = 1 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun t => (1/5 + 1/7) * (t - 1)
Proposed Answer: fun t : ℝ => (6 / 35)⁻¹ * (1 + 1 / 5 + 1 / 7) * (t - 1)
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: `fun t => (1/5 + 1/7) * (t - 1)`
   - Simplifies to `(12/35) * (t - 1)`

2. Proposed Answer: `fun t : ℝ => (6 / 35)⁻¹ * (1 + 1 / 5 + 1 / 7) * (t - 1)`
   - `(6/35)⁻¹ = 35/6`
   - `(1 + 1/5 + 1/7) = (35/35 + 7/35 + 5/35) = 47/35`
   - So this becomes `(35/6)*(47/35)*(t-1) = (47/6)*(t-1)`

The two expressions are clearly different:
- Ground truth: `12/35 * (t-1)`
- Proposed: `47/6 * (t-1)`

They are not equivalent.
