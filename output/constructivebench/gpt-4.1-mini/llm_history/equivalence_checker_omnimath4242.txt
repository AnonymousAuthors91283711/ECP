Ground Truth Answer: {2, 3} ∪ {a | ∃ n, a = ofDigits 10 (replicate (n + 1) 2 ++ [1])}
Proposed Answer: {a | ∃ q r : ℕ, a = 10*q + r ∧ r < 10 ∧ a^2 = (q^2 * 100 + 20 * q * r + r^2) ∧ (r * 10 + q)^2 = a^2}
Let me analyze the problem and the two answers.

The problem describes numbers a where:
1. You can take its last digit and move it to the front to get b
2. b squared equals c
3. You can take c's first digit and move it to the end to get d
4. d must equal a squared

The ground truth answer gives:
- The numbers 2 and 3 explicitly
- Plus numbers consisting of (n+1) twos followed by a one (like 21, 221, 2221, etc.)

The proposed answer describes numbers a that can be written as 10q + r (where r is the last digit <10) and satisfies two conditions about their squares.

Looking at the ground truth examples:
- For a=2: q=0, r=2 satisfies the proposed conditions
- For a=3: q=0, r=3 satisfies the proposed conditions
- For a=21: q=2, r=1 satisfies the proposed conditions
- For a=221: q=22, r=1 satisfies the proposed conditions

The proposed answer seems to correctly capture all cases where moving digits preserves the square relationship, matching the ground truth. The conditions in the proposed answer exactly enforce the digit-moving property described in the problem.
