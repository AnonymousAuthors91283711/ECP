Ground Truth Answer: fun modelWidth => (modelWidth * 10) / 3
Proposed Answer: fun modelWidth => modelWidth * (5 / 6)
Let's analyze the equivalence of these two answers:

1. Ground Truth: (modelWidth * 10) / 3
2. Proposed: modelWidth * (5 / 6)

We can simplify both expressions:
1. Ground Truth: modelWidth * (10/3) ≈ modelWidth * 3.333...
2. Proposed: modelWidth * (5/6) ≈ modelWidth * 0.833...

These are clearly different operations with different results. The ground truth multiplies by approximately 3.333 while the proposed answer multiplies by approximately 0.833.
