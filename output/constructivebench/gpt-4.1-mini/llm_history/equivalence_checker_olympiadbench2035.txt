Ground Truth Answer: 8 / (7 ^ (1/3))
Proposed Answer: 4 * (100 / 4 / (7 + 100 / 4))^(1/3)
Let's analyze the proposed answer and compare it to the ground truth answer.

1. The ground truth answer is 8 / (7^(1/3)), which simplifies to 8 / ∛7.

2. The proposed answer is 4 * (100/4 / (7 + 100/4))^(1/3). Let's simplify this:
   - 100/4 = 25
   - So it becomes 4 * (25 / (7 + 25))^(1/3) = 4 * (25/32)^(1/3) = 4 * ∛(25/32)

3. Now let's compare the two expressions:
   - Ground truth: 8 / ∛7
   - Proposed: 4 * ∛(25/32) = 4 * ∛25 / ∛32 = 4 * ∛25 / 2 = 2 * ∛25 ≈ 5.848

   While 8 / ∛7 ≈ 8 / 1.913 ≈ 4.182

4. The two expressions are not equal numerically, and they don't simplify to the same form algebraically.

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the ground truth answer.
