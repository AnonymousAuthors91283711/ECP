Ground Truth Answer: {n | ∃ k, n = 2^k}
Proposed Answer: { n | ∃ k : ℕ, n = 3 * k }
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
We need to find all positive integers n such that there exists an integer m where (2^n - 1) divides (m² + 9). The ground truth answer claims these are exactly the powers of 2.

Proposed Answer Analysis:
The proposed answer suggests these are exactly the multiples of 3.

Comparison:
1. For n=1 (2^1=2): m²+9 ≡ 0 mod 1 is trivial (m=0 works), and 1 is a power of 2 (2^0) but not a multiple of 3.
2. For n=2 (2^2-1=3): m²+9 ≡ 0 mod 3 ⇒ m² ≡ 0 mod 3 ⇒ m ≡ 0 mod 3 (works), and 2 is a power of 2 but not a multiple of 3.
3. For n=3 (2^3-1=7): We need m² ≡ -9 ≡ 5 mod 7, but squares mod 7 are 0,1,2,4 ⇒ no solution. 3 is a multiple of 3 but not a power of 2.
4. For n=4 (2^4-1=15): m² ≡ -9 ≡ 6 mod 15 ⇒ m² ≡ 6 mod 3 and mod 5 ⇒ impossible since 6 ≡ 0 mod 3 but 6 is not a square mod 5. 4 is a power of 2 but not a multiple of 3.

The ground truth answer correctly identifies the pattern (powers of 2 work, others don't), while the proposed answer is incorrect (some multiples of 3 don't work, and some non-multiples do work).
