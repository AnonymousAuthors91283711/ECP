Ground Truth Answer: 112
Proposed Answer: 52
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n such that:
   - 7n ≡ 0 mod 52 (meaning 7n is divisible by 52)
   - n ≡ 0 mod 2 (meaning n is even)

2. Ground truth answer is 112:
   - 7*112 = 784, and 784/52 = 15.076... → Wait no, actually 52*15 = 780, so 784-780=4 → Not divisible by 52
   - Wait, my calculation seems incorrect. Actually 52*15=780, 784-780=4, so 7*112 is not divisible by 52. This suggests the ground truth might be wrong.

3. Proposed answer is 52:
   - 7*52 = 364, and 364/52 = 7 exactly → divisible by 52
   - 52 is even → satisfies second condition
   - Checking if it's the smallest: next candidate would be 26, but 7*26=182, 182/52≈3.5 → not divisible

The ground truth answer appears incorrect (112 doesn't satisfy the first condition), while the proposed answer (52) satisfies both conditions and is indeed the smallest such number.

<<<False>>>

Note: The ground truth answer is incorrect while the proposed answer is correct, hence False (they are not equivalent, but in this case the proposed answer is actually right while ground truth is wrong).
