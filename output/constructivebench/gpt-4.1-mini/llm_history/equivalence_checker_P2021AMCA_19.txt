Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem: Find the number of real solutions x in [0, π] that satisfy the equation sin(π/2 * cos x) = cos(π/2 * sin x).

Analysis:
1. The equation can be rewritten using trigonometric identities. Note that cos(π/2 * sin x) = sin(π/2 - π/2 * sin x).
2. So the equation becomes sin(π/2 * cos x) = sin(π/2 - π/2 * sin x).
3. The general solution for sin A = sin B is A = B + 2πn or A = π - B + 2πn for integer n.
4. Within [0, π], the only relevant solutions come from π/2 * cos x = π/2 - π/2 * sin x, which simplifies to cos x + sin x = 1.
5. This can be written as √2 sin(x + π/4) = 1, giving two solutions in [0, π]: x = 0 and x = π/2.
6. The other case π/2 * cos x = π - (π/2 - π/2 * sin x) simplifies to cos x - sin x = 1, which gives x = 0 and x = 3π/2 (but 3π/2 is outside [0, π]).

Thus, there are exactly 2 valid solutions in [0, π]: x = 0 and x = π/2.

The ground truth answer is 2, while the proposed answer is 4. The proposed answer is incorrect as it overcounts the solutions.
