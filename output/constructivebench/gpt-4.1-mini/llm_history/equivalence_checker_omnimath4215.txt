Ground Truth Answer: fun m a b c i => 
    let S := a + b + c
    match i with
    | 0 => (1 / (m - 1)) * (c - S / (m + 2))
    | 1 => (1 / (m - 1)) * (b - S / (m + 2))
    | 2 => (1 / (m - 1)) * (a - S / (m + 2))
Proposed Answer: fun m a b c i => 
  let denom := (m + 2) * (m - 1)
  match i with
  | ⟨0, _⟩ => ((m - 1) * a + (1 - m) * b + (m^2 - 1) * c) / denom
  | ⟨1, _⟩ => ((m^2 - 1) * a + (m - 1) * b + (1 - m) * c) / denom
  | ⟨2, _⟩ => ((1 - m) * a + (m^2 - 1) * b + (m - 1) * c) / denom
Let's analyze the equivalence between the two answers.

1. First, let's rewrite the ground truth answer in a more expanded form:
   For i=0: (c - (a+b+c)/(m+2)) / (m-1) = [c(m+2) - (a+b+c)] / [(m-1)(m+2)]
   = [mc + 2c - a - b - c] / denom = [-a - b + (m+1)c] / denom

2. Now let's expand the proposed answer for i=0:
   [(m-1)a + (1-m)b + (m²-1)c] / denom
   = [(m-1)a - (m-1)b + (m-1)(m+1)c] / denom
   = (m-1)[a - b + (m+1)c] / denom
   = [a - b + (m+1)c] / (m+2)

This doesn't match the ground truth expansion. Similar discrepancies would appear for i=1 and i=2.

The key difference is that the ground truth answer maintains symmetry in the solution (rotating a, b, c for different indices), while the proposed answer doesn't preserve this symmetry correctly.
