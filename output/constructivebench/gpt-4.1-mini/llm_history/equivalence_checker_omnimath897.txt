  let Z := Finset.Icc 1 100

Ground Truth Answer: 217 / 900
Proposed Answer: (201 : ℚ) / (100 : ℚ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the average number of divisors for numbers from 1 to 100. It sums up all divisor relationships and divides by the total possible pairs.

2. The ground truth answer is 217/900 ≈ 0.24111...

3. The proposed answer is 201/100 = 2.01

The proposed answer is clearly different from the ground truth answer, both in value and in magnitude (it's about 10 times larger). The proposed answer doesn't make sense as an average number of divisors, since we know the average should be between 0 and 1 (as it's a probability).
