Ground Truth Answer: {1}
Proposed Answer: { n : ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, 0 < k ∧ n = k * k }
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is about determining for which natural numbers n > 0 there exists a matrix (with positive dimensions) where:
1. All entries divide n
2. All entries are distinct
3. All row sums are equal
4. All column sums are equal

The ground truth answer is {1}, meaning only n=1 satisfies these conditions. The proposed answer suggests it's the set of perfect squares (n = k² for k > 0).

Let's test this:
- For n=1 (k=1): Works (1x1 matrix with [1])
- For n=4 (k=2): Try to construct a matrix. The divisors are 1,2,4. To have equal row/column sums with distinct entries, we'd need something like [[1,3],[3,1]] but 3 doesn't divide 4. Any combination using 1,2,4 won't satisfy all conditions simultaneously.

Therefore, only n=1 works, and the proposed answer of perfect squares is incorrect.
