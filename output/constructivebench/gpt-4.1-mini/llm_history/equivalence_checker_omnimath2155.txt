Ground Truth Answer: 201
Proposed Answer: (2014 - 4) / 5 + 1 - ((2014 - 4) / 5 + 1) / 2
Let me analyze this carefully.

1. The problem is counting numbers between 4 and 2014 that:
   - Are congruent to 4 mod 5 (n % 5 = 4)
   - Have an even sum of digits in base 10

2. The ground truth answer is 201.

3. The proposed answer calculates:
   - Total numbers ≡4 mod5 in range: (2014-4)/5 + 1 = 403
   - Then subtracts half of them: 403 - 403/2 ≈ 201.5

4. The reasoning is that:
   - The digit sum condition should be true for about half the numbers
   - The calculation gives 201.5, which rounds to 201 (ground truth)

However, this is not rigorous because:
- The digit sum parity isn't perfectly uniformly distributed
- The answer should be an exact integer, not a rounded value
