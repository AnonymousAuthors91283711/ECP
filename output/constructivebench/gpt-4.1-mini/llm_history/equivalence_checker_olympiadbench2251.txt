Ground Truth Answer: 48
Proposed Answer: 63
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find the greatest 2-digit number (n between 10 and 99) where when you reverse its digits (ba) it equals 7/4 times the original number (ab).

2. Mathematically, for n = 10a + b (where a is tens digit, b is units digit), the condition is:
   10b + a = (7/4)(10a + b)

3. Solving this equation:
   4(10b + a) = 7(10a + b)
   40b + 4a = 70a + 7b
   33b = 66a
   b = 2a

4. Possible 2-digit numbers where b = 2a:
   a=1 → 12
   a=2 → 24
   a=3 → 36
   a=4 → 48
   (a=5 → 60 but 2*5=10 which isn't a single digit)

5. The greatest valid number is 48.

The proposed answer 63 doesn't satisfy b=2a (since 3≠2*6), and testing it:
Reverse of 63 is 36, but 36 ≠ (7/4)*63 (which would be 110.25).
