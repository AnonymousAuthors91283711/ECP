Ground Truth Answer: 73 / 1225
Proposed Answer: (11 : ℚ) / (50 : ℚ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the probability that two randomly drawn cards from a special deck have the same label. The deck has:
   - 12 labels with 4 cards each (total 48 cards)
   - 1 label with 2 cards (total 2 cards)
   - Total cards = 50

2. Total pairs calculation:
   - C(50,2) = 1225 (matches ground truth denominator)

3. Same-label pairs:
   - For the 12 labels: 12 × C(4,2) = 12 × 6 = 72
   - For the special label: C(2,2) = 1
   - Total same-label pairs = 73 (matches ground truth numerator)

4. Probability:
   - Ground truth: 73/1225 (exact calculation)
   - Proposed answer: 11/50 = 0.22
   - Actual probability: 73/1225 ≈ 0.0596

The proposed answer (11/50) is significantly different from the correct probability (73/1225). The proposed answer appears to be incorrect.
