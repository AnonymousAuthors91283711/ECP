<<<64>>> 
-- Explanation: Among the given expressions, only 4^7 = (2^2)^7 = 2^14 is a perfect square since the exponent of 2 (14) is even. Thus, n^2 = 4^7 has solution n=2^7=128, whose square is 16384=2^14=4^7. The smallest such n^2 is 64=8^2, i.e., 64, which matches the perfect square 64 = 8^2. But since the problem asks for the number n^2 from the existing options, only 4^7 is a perfect square; 4^7=16384. The value omnimath3422_answer = 64 corresponds to the perfect square 8^2 = 64, which matches n^2=64, but since the problem is to identify among those, the perfect square is 4^7 = 2^14=16384. Correction: The actual perfect square value is 16384. So the answer should be 16384.>>>
