Ground Truth Answer: 9
Proposed Answer: 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves solving a nested logarithmic equation with constraints:
   - log₂(log₂(2x - 2)) = 2
   - 2x - 2 > 0
   - log₂(2x - 2) > 0

2. Ground Truth Answer is 9
3. Proposed Answer is 3

Let's test the proposed answer (3):
- 2*3 - 2 = 4
- log₂(4) = 2
- log₂(2) = 1 ≠ 2 (which is required by the first equation)

Now test the ground truth (9):
- 2*9 - 2 = 16
- log₂(16) = 4
- log₂(4) = 2 (matches the first equation)
- All constraints are satisfied

The proposed answer (3) doesn't satisfy the main equation, while the ground truth (9) does. They are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
