Ground Truth Answer: 75
Proposed Answer: 100 * 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves logarithms and their relationships given certain constraints on positive real numbers x, y, z.

2. The ground truth answer is 75, which comes from solving the system of equations derived from the given conditions.

3. The proposed answer is "100 * 9", which evaluates to 900.

4. 900 is clearly not equal to 75, and there's no mathematical transformation that would make these equivalent in this context.

5. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth in any way (not even close numerically), and there's no indication that it's a simplified form or alternative representation of 75.
