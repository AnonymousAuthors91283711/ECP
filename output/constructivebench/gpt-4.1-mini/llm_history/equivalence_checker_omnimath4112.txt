Ground Truth Answer: {fun x : ℝ => 1 / 2, fun x : ℝ => 0, fun x : ℝ => x ^ 2}
Proposed Answer: { f | (∀ x, f x = 0) ∨ (∀ x, f x = 1) ∨ ∃ a b : ℝ, ∀ x, f x = a * x + b }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for all real-valued functions f:ℝ→ℝ that satisfy the functional equation:
   f(x²) + f(2y²) = (f(x+y) + f(y)) * (f(x-y) + f(y)) for all x,y ∈ ℝ

2. The ground truth answer provides three specific solutions:
   - The constant zero function (f(x) = 0)
   - The constant 1/2 function (f(x) = 1/2)
   - The quadratic function (f(x) = x²)

3. The proposed answer suggests:
   - All constant zero functions (matches ground truth)
   - All constant functions f(x) = 1 (doesn't match ground truth)
   - All linear functions f(x) = ax + b (only x² matches from ground truth)

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It includes f(x) = 1 which doesn't satisfy the equation
- It includes all linear functions when only f(x) = x² works among non-constant solutions
- It misses the f(x) = 1/2 solution from ground truth

<<<False>>>
