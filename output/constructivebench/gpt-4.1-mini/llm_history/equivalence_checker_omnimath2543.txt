Ground Truth Answer: 117649
Proposed Answer: (7 : ℂ)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about a 7th degree polynomial P = X^7 - 7 with distinct roots r_i (since i ≠ j ⇒ r_i ≠ r_j).

2. K is defined as a product of sums of roots (r_i + r_j) for all i < j pairs.

3. The ground truth answer claims K² = 117649, which is 7^6 = (7^3)^2.

4. The proposed answer is simply (7 : ℂ), which would imply K² = 7, not matching the ground truth.

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- The product K involves pairs of roots, and for a 7th degree polynomial, there are C(7,2) = 21 such pairs
- The correct evaluation should lead to K² = 7^6, not 7
- 117649 is indeed 7^6, which matches the ground truth
