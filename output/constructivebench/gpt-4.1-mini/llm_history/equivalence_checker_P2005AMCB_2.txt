theorem P2005AMCB_2 (x : ℝ) (hx : 0 < x) : 
    x / 100 * x = 4 ↔ x = P2005AMCB_2_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 20
Proposed Answer: 200
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives the equation: x/100 * x = 4
2. Simplifying: x²/100 = 4 → x² = 400 → x = ±20
3. Given the constraint hx : 0 < x, we discard the negative solution, leaving x = 20

The ground truth answer is 20, which is correct.
The proposed answer is 200, which would give 200²/100 = 400 ≠ 4, so it's incorrect.

<<<False>>>
