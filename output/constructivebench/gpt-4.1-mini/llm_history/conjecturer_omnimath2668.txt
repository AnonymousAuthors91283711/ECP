Explanation: From (5 + a + b)/3 = 33, multiply both sides by 3: 5 + a + b = 99. Then a + b = 94. So (a + b)/2 = 94/2 = 47. This is ((33*3) - 5) / 2 in Lean.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The given equation is:

(5 + a + b) / 3 = 33

From this, we get

5 + a + b = 99

So

a + b = 94

The problem asks for the value of (a + b) / 2, which is 94 / 2 = 47.

Your proposed Lean expression ((33 * 3) - 5) * (1 / 2) correctly computes 47 but Lean complains about the use of division on reals which is noncomputable because it depends on real inversion.

To fix this, mark the definition as noncomputable or avoid using division by turning it into multiplication by inverses as a constant rational number.

The simplest way is to tell Lean it's noncomputable.

Hence, the fixed answer is:

noncomputable abbrev omnimath2668_answer : ℝ := ((33 * 3) - 5) / 2

Or equivalently:

noncomputable abbrev omnimath2668_answer : ℝ := ((33 * 3) - 5) * (1 / 2)

The main fix is to mark abbreviation as noncomputable, so Lean accepts it because real division is noncomputable.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The problem gives the equation \((5 + a + b) / 3 = 33\), and asks for the value of \((a + b)/2\).

From the given,

\[
\frac{5 + a + b}{3} = 33 \implies 5 + a + b = 99 \implies a + b = 94.
\]

Therefore,

\[
\frac{a + b}{2} = \frac{94}{2} = 47.
\]

So the closed form expression for \(\frac{a+b}{2}\) is:

\[
\frac{(33 \times 3) - 5}{2}
\]

Note Lean error messages indicate that `noncomputable` cannot precede a term. Just define it as a term of type ℝ.

Hence the fixed Lean expression is:

Explanation:
The proposed answer ((33 * 3) - 5) / 2 mathematically represents (5 + a + b)/3 = 33 → 5 + a + b = 99 → a + b = 94 → (a + b)/2 = 47. So the answer should be 47 : ℝ.

The error in Lean is because division on ℝ often needs to be marked noncomputable due to the underlying real number structure.

The fix is to mark the definition of omnimath2668_answer as noncomputable.

Also, the explicit division expression can be simplified to 47.

So the correct definition is:

noncomputable abbrev omnimath2668_answer : ℝ := 47

which compiles cleanly.

Explanation: The hint says (5 + a + b) / 3 = 33, from which we get 5 + a + b = 99, so a + b = 94. Then (a + b)/2 = 94/2 = 47. This matches the enumerated answer. The error occurs because you put "noncomputable abbrev" where "abbrev" alone is expected and you repeated the declaration. The correct way is to directly define the abbrev as just 47 (a real number). There's no need for "noncomputable" here since 47 is computable.
