Ground Truth Answer: 153
Proposed Answer: 289
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n > 10 where the sum of its digits in base 17 equals the sum of its digits in base 10.

2. Ground truth answer is 153. Let's verify:
   - Base 10 digits: 1, 5, 3 → sum = 9
   - Base 17 representation: 153 ÷ 17 = 9 with remainder 0 → digits are 9, 0 → sum = 9
   - This satisfies the condition and is indeed the smallest such number > 10.

3. Proposed answer is 289:
   - Base 10 digits: 2, 8, 9 → sum = 19
   - Base 17 representation: 289 ÷ 17 = 17 with remainder 0, then 17 ÷ 17 = 1 with remainder 0 → digits are 1, 0, 0 → sum = 1
   - The sums don't match (19 ≠ 1), so 289 doesn't satisfy the condition.

The proposed answer is incorrect both in terms of satisfying the condition and being the smallest solution.
