Ground Truth Answer: fun (m, n) => Nat.gcd (m + 1) n = 1
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℕ × ℕ => x.2 = 1 ∨ x.1 = 0
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
- The theorem states a condition about polynomial divisibility
- It's asking when the polynomial ∑X^(n*k) is divisible by ∑X^k (for k=0 to m)
- This is equivalent to asking when X^n is a primitive (m+1)-th root of unity

Ground Truth Answer:
- Correctly identifies that divisibility occurs when gcd(m+1,n)=1
- This makes sense because we need n and m+1 to be coprime for the roots to align properly

Proposed Answer:
- Suggests either n=1 or m=0
- n=1 is a special case where gcd(m+1,1)=1 always holds (correct)
- m=0 is excluded by the theorem's hypotheses (m>0)
- The answer misses all other cases where gcd(m+1,n)=1 but n≠1

Conclusion:
The proposed answer is incomplete and incorrect for cases where n>1 but still coprime with m+1.
