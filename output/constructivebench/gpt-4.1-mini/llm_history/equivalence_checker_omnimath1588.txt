Ground Truth Answer: (sqrt 2 - 1) * (sqrt 3 + sqrt 2)
Proposed Answer: -cot (π / 360)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

1. First, let's understand the problem: It's asking for the ratio of the sum of cosine terms to the sum of sine terms for angles from 30.5° to 44.5° in 1° increments.

2. The ground truth answer is given as (√2 - 1)(√3 + √2).

3. The proposed answer is -cot(π/360), which equals -cot(0.5°).

4. Let's evaluate both expressions numerically:
   - Ground truth: (√2 - 1)(√3 + √2) ≈ (1.4142 - 1)(1.732 + 1.4142) ≈ 0.4142 * 3.146 ≈ 1.303
   - Proposed answer: -cot(0.5°) ≈ -114.589 ≈ -114.6

5. The numerical values are vastly different (1.303 vs -114.6), indicating they cannot be equivalent.

6. The proposed answer seems to be missing some key simplifications or transformations that would lead to the ground truth answer.
