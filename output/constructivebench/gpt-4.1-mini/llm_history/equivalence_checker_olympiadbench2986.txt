Ground Truth Answer: fun T => Int.toNat (round ((T * 5 * 20.19) / 60 : ℝ))
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n + 41
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us T=60 and expects the answer to be 101. The ground truth answer is a function that calculates this based on a real-valued formula involving T.

2. Ground truth answer:
   - For T=60: (60*5*20.19)/60 = 5*20.19 = 100.95
   - round(100.95) = 101
   - Int.toNat gives 101
   - This matches the required hT condition

3. Proposed answer:
   - For T=60: 60 + 41 = 101
   - This matches the required hT condition
   - However, for other values of T, it gives completely different results than the ground truth
   - Example for T=30:
     - Ground truth: (30*5*20.19)/60 ≈ 50.475 → round → 50
     - Proposed: 30 + 41 = 71

The proposed answer only works for T=60 by coincidence, but doesn't match the general formula. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
