Ground Truth Answer: 1958
Proposed Answer: 1969
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem asks to find the smallest positive real number n such that:
n + floor(√n) + floor(n^(1/3)) = 2014

We need to verify if 1969 satisfies this equation and is indeed the smallest such number.

1. Calculate floor(√1969):
√1969 ≈ 44.37 → floor = 44

2. Calculate floor(1969^(1/3)):
1969^(1/3) ≈ 12.53 → floor = 12

3. Sum: 1969 + 44 + 12 = 2025 ≠ 2014

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the equation. The ground truth answer 1958 does satisfy it:
1958 + floor(√1958) + floor(1958^(1/3)) = 1958 + 44 + 12 = 2014

<<<False>>>
