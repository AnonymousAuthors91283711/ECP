Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: 29
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a sequence where:
   - a1 = 9 (arithmetic sequence start)
   - a2 = a1 + d
   - a3 = a2 + d
   - g1 = a1 = 9 (geometric sequence start)
   - g2 = a2 + 2 = 9 + d + 2 = 11 + d
   - g3 = a3 + 20 = 9 + 2d + 20 = 29 + 2d

2. The condition g2² = g1 * g3 gives us:
   (11 + d)² = 9*(29 + 2d)
   Expanding: 121 + 22d + d² = 261 + 18d
   Simplifying: d² + 4d - 140 = 0
   Solving: d = [-4 ± √(16 + 560)]/2 = [-4 ± √576]/2 = [-4 ± 24]/2
   Solutions: d = 10 or d = -14

3. For g3 = 29 + 2d:
   - When d = 10: g3 = 29 + 20 = 49
   - When d = -14: g3 = 29 - 28 = 1

4. The problem asks for the least value of g3, which is clearly 1 (when d = -14).

The ground truth answer is 1, while the proposed answer is 29. These are clearly different values, and 29 is not a valid solution to the problem.
