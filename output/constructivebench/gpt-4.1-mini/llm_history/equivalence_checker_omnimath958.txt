theorem omnimath958 :

Ground Truth Answer: {0, 2, 1 + Real.sqrt 6, 1 - Real.sqrt 6, 1 + 2 * Real.sqrt 2, 1 - 2 * Real.sqrt 2}
Proposed Answer: {x | x = -2 ∨ x = -1 ∨ x = 3 ∨ x = 4 ∨ x = 1 - √2 ∨ x = 1 + √2}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the set of real roots of a 6th degree polynomial equation.

2. The ground truth answer provides 6 distinct real roots.

3. The proposed answer also provides 6 roots, but they are different from the ground truth:
   - -2 and -1 are roots of (x² + 3x + 2)
   - 3 and 4 are roots of (x² - 7x + 12)
   - 1±√2 would be roots of (x² - 2x - 1), but this is incorrect as the correct roots should be 1±√(1+1) = 1±√2 (this part is actually correct)

However, the main issue is that the proposed answer is solving each quadratic factor separately and taking their union, which is incorrect because the equation is a product of factors plus 24, not equal to zero. The correct approach would require solving the entire polynomial equation, not just its factors.

The ground truth answer shows roots that come from solving the complete equation, which results in different values than just the roots of individual factors.
