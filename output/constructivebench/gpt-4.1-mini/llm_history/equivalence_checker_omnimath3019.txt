Ground Truth Answer: 45
Proposed Answer: 5 * 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us 3^x = 5 and asks for the value of 3^(x+2)
2. We can rewrite 3^(x+2) as 3^x * 3^2 = 5 * 9 = 45
3. The ground truth answer is 45
4. The proposed answer is 5 * 9, which equals 45

The proposed answer is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth answer, just written in a different form (expanded multiplication rather than the simplified product).
