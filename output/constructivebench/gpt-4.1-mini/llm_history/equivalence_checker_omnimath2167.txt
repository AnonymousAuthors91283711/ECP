Ground Truth Answer: Real.sqrt 3
Proposed Answer: 2 * (3 * 5)^(1/2)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

1. The ground truth answer is √3 (approximately 1.732)
2. The proposed answer is 2 * √15 (since (3*5)^(1/2) = √15, approximately 7.746)

Now let's compare them:
√3 ≈ 1.732
2√15 ≈ 7.746

These are clearly different values, not equivalent. The proposed answer is significantly larger than the ground truth answer.

<<<False>>>
