Ground Truth Answer: (√6 - √2) / 2
Proposed Answer: sqrt 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the norm of the difference between two complex numbers a and b, both with unit norm, and satisfying a specific condition involving their product and conjugate.

2. The condition given is: a*conj(b) + conj(a)*b = √3

3. This expression is actually equal to 2 * Re(a*conj(b)) = √3, since a*conj(b) + conj(a)*b = 2Re(a*conj(b))

4. The norm ‖a - b‖ can be computed as sqrt(‖a‖² + ‖b‖² - 2Re(a*conj(b))) = sqrt(1 + 1 - √3) = sqrt(2 - √3)

5. The ground truth answer (√6 - √2)/2 is indeed equal to sqrt(2 - √3), as can be verified by squaring both sides.

6. The proposed answer "sqrt 2" is clearly different from sqrt(2 - √3), and doesn't satisfy the given conditions.
