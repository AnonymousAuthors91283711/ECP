Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | Even n ∧ n > 0}
Proposed Answer: { n : ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, k > 1 ∧ ∃ a : ℕ, n * (k^2 - 1) = a^2 }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is close but not exactly equivalent to the ground truth. The ground truth correctly identifies all positive even numbers as solutions, while the proposed answer describes numbers that can be expressed in a specific form (n*(k²-1) = a²). While these forms overlap for many even numbers, they are not exactly equivalent sets. The proposed answer might miss some even numbers or include some odd numbers that satisfy the condition.
