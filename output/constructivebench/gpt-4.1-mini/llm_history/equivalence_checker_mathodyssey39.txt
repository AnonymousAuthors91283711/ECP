Ground Truth Answer: 160
Proposed Answer: 100 + 101 + 105 + 110 + 115 + 120
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a set of natural numbers k where the digit product equals (25*k)/8 - 211, and then to sum these numbers.

2. The ground truth answer is 160.

3. The proposed answer is the sum 100 + 101 + 105 + 110 + 115 + 120 = 651.

4. Clearly, 651 ≠ 160.

5. The proposed answer is giving the actual numbers that satisfy the condition (which sum to 651), while the ground truth claims the sum is 160.

6. Either the ground truth is incorrect, or the proposed answer found wrong numbers that satisfy the condition.

Since the sums don't match and there's no indication the proposed numbers are incorrect, we must conclude the answers are not equivalent.
