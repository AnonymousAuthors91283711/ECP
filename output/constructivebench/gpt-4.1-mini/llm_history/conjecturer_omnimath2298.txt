The problem involves two points \( (x_1, x_1^2) \), \( (x_2, x_2^2) \) on the parabola \( y = x^2 \) whose midpoint is fixed at \( (5, 101) \). Given the line \( y = a x + b \) passes through both points, we want to find \( a + b \).

From the midpoint condition: 
\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = 5 \implies x_1 + x_2 = 10,
\]
\[
\frac{x_1^2 + x_2^2}{2} = 101 \implies x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 202.
\]

Using \( (x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + 2 x_1 x_2 + x_2^2 \), we get
\[
100 = 202 + 2 x_1 x_2 \implies x_1 x_2 = -51.
\]

The line passes through both points, so
\[
a x_i + b = x_i^2,
\]
so for both \( x_1, x_2 \),
\[
x_i^2 - a x_i - b = 0.
\]
This quadratic has roots \( x_1, x_2 \), so
\[
x^2 - a x - b = (x - x_1)(x - x_2) = x^2 - (x_1 + x_2) x + x_1 x_2,
\]
implying
\[
-a = -(x_1 + x_2) = -10, \quad -b = x_1 x_2 = -51.
\]

Therefore
\[
a = 10, \quad b = 51,
\]
and
\[
a + b = 10 + 51 = 61.
\]

The function \( (5, 101) \mapsto 61 \) generalizes as follows: given the midpoint \( m = \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} \) and corresponding midpoint on the parabola \( n = \frac{x_1^2 + x_2^2}{2} \), solve for \( a \) and \( b \):

\[
a = x_1 + x_2 = 2 m,
\]
\[
b = - x_1 x_2 = m^2 - n,
\]
using \( x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2 x_1 x_2 \), so
\[
x_1 x_2 = m^2 - n.
\]

Thus,
\[
a + b = 2 m + m^2 - n.
\]

We define:
```lean
fun p : ℝ × ℝ => 2 * p.1 + p.1^2 - p.2
```

This is computable and fits the problem. Marking as `noncomputable` is unnecessary if we avoid using division in a problematic way.
