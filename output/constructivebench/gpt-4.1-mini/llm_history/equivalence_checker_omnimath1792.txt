Ground Truth Answer: 7521
Proposed Answer: 2197
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest 4-digit number (n = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d) where:
   - Digits are strictly decreasing (a > b > c > d > 0)
   - The complex expression involving roots of unity evaluates to √3

2. The ground truth answer is 7521, which satisfies:
   - Digits: 7 > 5 > 2 > 1
   - The complex expression indeed evaluates to √3 (this can be verified)

3. The proposed answer is 2197, which:
   - Has digits 2 > 1 > 9 > 7, but this violates the digit ordering (1 > 9 is false)
   - Even if we consider 2 > 1 > 9 > 7 as valid (which it isn't), the complex expression wouldn't evaluate to √3

The proposed answer fails both the digit ordering condition and the complex expression condition. It's completely incorrect.

<<<False>>>
