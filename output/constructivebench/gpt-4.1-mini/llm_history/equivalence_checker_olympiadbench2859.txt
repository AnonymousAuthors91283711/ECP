theorem olympiadbench2859 (T : ℕ) :
  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | let k := 21 + 2 * T;
                     let f := fun n => 2 * n^2 - k * n + 77;
                     f n > 0 ∧ Nat.Prime (f n)} (olympiadbench2859_answer T) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun T => 12  -- The answer is constant regardless of T
Proposed Answer: fun T => let k := 21 + 2 * T; (k - 1) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the greatest natural number n such that f(n) = 2n² - kn + 77 is both positive and prime, where k = 21 + 2T.

2. The ground truth answer is a constant function that always returns 12, regardless of T.

3. The proposed answer is (k-1)/2 = (20 + 2T)/2 = 10 + T, which grows linearly with T.

For large T, the proposed answer (10 + T) will exceed the ground truth answer (12). For example:
- When T=0: proposed=10, ground truth=12
- When T=1: proposed=11, ground truth=12
- When T=2: proposed=12, ground truth=12
- When T=3: proposed=13, ground truth=12

The proposed answer only matches the ground truth when T=2, and is incorrect for all other values of T. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
