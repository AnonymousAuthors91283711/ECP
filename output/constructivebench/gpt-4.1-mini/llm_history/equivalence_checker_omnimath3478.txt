abbrev omnimath3478_answer : â„• := sorry
theorem omnimath3478 : 
  (2^4 - 2) / (2^3 - 1) = omnimath3478_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: 3
Let's evaluate the problem and the answers:

The problem presents a mathematical expression to evaluate:
(2^4 - 2) / (2^3 - 1)

Calculating step by step:
Numerator: 2^4 - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14
Denominator: 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7
Result: 14 / 7 = 2

The ground truth answer is 2, which matches our calculation.
The proposed answer is 3, which does not match.

<<<False>>>
