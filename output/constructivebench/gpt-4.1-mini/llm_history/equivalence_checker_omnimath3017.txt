  (htranslated_line : translated_line = fun x => line x + 4) :

Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: 3
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The original line is defined as line(x) = 2x - 6
2. The translated line is defined as translated_line(x) = line(x) + 4 = (2x - 6) + 4 = 2x - 2
3. To find where translated_line(x) = 0:
   2x - 2 = 0 → 2x = 2 → x = 1

The ground truth answer correctly solves for x = 1, while the proposed answer gives x = 3. These are clearly different values.
