theorem olympiadbench2445 (x y : ℝ) (hx : x > 0) (hy : y > 0) :
  logb 10 (x^3) + logb 10 (y^2) = 11 ∧ logb 10 (x^2) - logb 10 (y^3) = 3 ↔ (x, y) = olympiadbench2445_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ × ℝ
<<<(10 ^ 5, 10 ^ 1)>>>
Explanation: From the system of equations, convert logs to exponents and solve for x and y: x^3 y^2 = 10^11, x^2 / y^3 = 10^3. Solving gives x = 10^5, y = 10.
