The problem relates the prices of adults and children tickets, where the child price is half the adult price, and the total amount from selling some tickets is given. We want to find the total amount from selling 8 adult and 6 child tickets.

Given:
- child_price = adult_price / 2
- 5 * adult_price + 4 * child_price = 24.50

Replace child_price in the equation:
5 * adult_price + 4 * (adult_price / 2) = 24.50
5 * adult_price + 2 * adult_price = 24.50
7 * adult_price = 24.50
adult_price = 24.50 / 7

Then:
child_price = (24.50 / 7) / 2 = 24.50 / 14

Now the desired amount:
8 * adult_price + 6 * child_price
= 8 * (24.50 / 7) + 6 * (24.50 / 14)
= (8 * 24.50 / 7) + (6 * 24.50 / 14)
= (8 * 24.50 / 7) + (3 * 24.50 / 7)
= (11 * 24.50) / 7
= 11 * (24.50 / 7)

Therefore, the answer should be a constant expression: 11 * (24.50 / 7).

In Lean, we cannot use 'adult_price' or 'child_price' inside the abbreviation since they are variables in the theorem. The answer must be a fixed real number.

Hence, the final answer:

The problem is that the division 24.50 / 7 within Lean's term requires marking it as noncomputable since real number division is not computable by default in Lean's core. Marking the definition as noncomputable will fix the error.

Also, the value (11 * (24.50 / 7)) corresponds to the expression 11 * (24.50 / 7) which is exactly the computed value of 8 * adult_price + 6 * child_price under the given constraints. This can be derived by replacing child_price = adult_price / 2 and solving:

5a + 4*(a/2) = 24.5 → 5a + 2a = 24.5 → 7a = 24.5 → a = 24.5 / 7

Then 8a + 6(a/2) = 8a + 3a = 11a = 11 * (24.5/7)

Hence, the closed form expression is correct.

The fixed Lean code snippet is:

noncomputable abbrev P2014AMCA_2_answer : ℝ := 11 * (24.50 / 7)

which will compile and be accepted.

The problem is a classic system of linear equations: given child_price = adult_price / 2 and 5 adult_price + 4 child_price = 24.50, we want to find value of 8 adult_price + 6 child_price. Substitute child_price = adult_price / 2 into the first equation:

5 adult_price + 4 (adult_price / 2) = 24.50  
5 adult_price + 2 adult_price = 24.50  
7 adult_price = 24.50  
adult_price = 24.50 / 7

Therefore child_price = (24.50 / 7) / 2 = 24.50 / 14.

Finally,

8 adult_price + 6 child_price  
= 8 * (24.50 / 7) + 6 * (24.50 / 14)  
= (8 * 24.50 / 7) + (6 * 24.50 / 14)  
= (8 * 24.50 / 7) + (3 * 24.50 / 7)  
= 11 * (24.50 / 7)

Thus the expression 11 * (24.50 / 7) is the exact value.

The error arises because `noncomputable` is a keyword used for definitions or lemmas to mark them as noncomputable, but cannot be used as a function wrapper inside an expression. The correct way is just to write the expression as is.

We also note that 24.50 is a decimal number, which Lean requires to be specified as a real literal with a decimal point and underscore for readability (24.50 is acceptable), or better to write as `2450/100` for exact rational interpretation, but since we use ℝ type, it is fine.

Hence the correct answer in Lean expression is:

The problem involves prices for adults and children, with child_price = adult_price / 2 and 5*adult_price + 4*child_price = 24.50.

From the given, we have:

5a + 4(a/2) = 24.5  
5a + 2a = 24.5  
7a = 24.5  
a = 24.5 / 7

Then child_price = (24.5 / 7) / 2 = 24.5 / 14.

We want to find 8 * adult_price + 6 * child_price:

8a + 6(a/2) = 8a + 3a = 11a = 11 * (24.5 / 7)

So the expression is 11 * (24.5 / 7) which is a noncomputable real expression since Real division and literals like 24.5 create compilation issues in Lean's constructive core.

The fix is to mark the abbreviation as noncomputable to allow the division over reals.

Hence, write:

noncomputable abbrev P2014AMCA_2_answer : ℝ := 11 * (24.5 / 7)

This resolves the error and matches the derived answer.
