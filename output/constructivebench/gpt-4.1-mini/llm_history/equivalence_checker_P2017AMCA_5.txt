Ground Truth Answer: 245
Proposed Answer: 20 * 19 / 2 + 20 * 10
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting handshakes between two groups:
   - huggers (size k=20)
   - handshakers (size m=10)
   - Total people n=30

2. The formula given is:
   (handshakers.card * (handshakers.card - 1)) / 2 + handshakers.card * huggers.card

3. Ground truth answer is 245

4. Proposed answer calculates:
   20 * 19 / 2 + 20 * 10 = 190 + 200 = 390

The proposed answer incorrectly swapped the sizes of the groups (used 20 for handshakers when it should be 10, and 10 for huggers when it should be 20). The correct calculation should be:
(10 * 9)/2 + 10 * 20 = 45 + 200 = 245

<<<False>>>
