Ground Truth Answer: {4} ∪ {n | n ≥ 6}
Proposed Answer: {n | n = 1 ∨ n ≥ 4}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for which positive natural numbers n can be expressed as both the sum and product of k numbers (k≥2) where all numbers are positive rationals.

2. The ground truth answer is {4} ∪ {n | n ≥ 6}, meaning only 4 and numbers ≥6 satisfy the condition.

3. The proposed answer is {n | n = 1 ∨ n ≥ 4}, which includes 1 and all numbers ≥4.

Key differences:
- The proposed answer incorrectly includes 1 (n=1 is explicitly excluded by hn : n > 0, but even if we consider n≥1, 1 cannot be expressed as both sum and product of ≥2 positive numbers)
- The proposed answer incorrectly includes 5 (5 cannot be expressed this way, which is why the ground truth starts at 6)
- Both agree on n≥6 and include 4

The proposed answer is mostly correct for n≥4 but makes two significant errors (including 1 and 5).
