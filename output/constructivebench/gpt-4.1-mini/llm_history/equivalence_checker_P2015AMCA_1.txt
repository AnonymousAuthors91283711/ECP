noncomputable abbrev P2015AMCA_1_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2015AMCA_1 :
  (5 * ((2^0 - 1 + 5^2 - 0)^(-1 : ℝ)) = P2015AMCA_1_answer) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1/5
Proposed Answer: 5 / 26
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents an equation: 5 * ((2^0 - 1 + 5^2 - 0)^(-1)) = ?

2. Let's evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:
   - 2^0 = 1
   - 1 - 1 = 0
   - 5^2 = 25
   - 25 - 0 = 25
   - So the denominator becomes 25^(-1) which is 1/25

3. Now multiply by 5: 5 * (1/25) = 5/25 = 1/5

4. Ground truth answer is 1/5 (which matches our calculation)
5. Proposed answer is 5/26

The proposed answer incorrectly calculates the denominator as (1 - 1 + 25 - 0) = 25, but then uses 26 in the final answer. This is incorrect.
