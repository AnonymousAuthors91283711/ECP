abbrev omnimath372_answer : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ → Bool := sorry
theorem omnimath372 (v e f : ℕ) : 
  (v - e + f = 2) ↔ omnimath372_answer (v, e, f) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun (v, e, f) => v - e + f = 2
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ => p.1 - p.2.1 + p.2.2 = 2
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The ground truth answer and proposed answer are equivalent. The ground truth uses pattern matching on the tuple (v, e, f) directly, while the proposed answer uses projection functions (p.1 for the first element, p.2.1 for the second, and p.2.2 for the third). Both implementations check the same mathematical condition v - e + f = 2, just expressed differently in terms of how they access the tuple elements. The behavior is identical for all inputs.
