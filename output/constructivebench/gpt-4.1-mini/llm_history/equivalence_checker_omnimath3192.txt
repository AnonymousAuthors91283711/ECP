Ground Truth Answer: 38
Proposed Answer: 12
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us an equation relating previousGames to nextPoints:
   - Initial condition: 20*previousGames + 36 = 21*(previousGames + 1)
   - We need to find nextPoints such that: 20*previousGames + 36 + nextPoints = 22*(previousGames + 2)

2. First, let's solve for previousGames using the initial condition:
   20p + 36 = 21(p + 1)
   20p + 36 = 21p + 21
   36 - 21 = 21p - 20p
   15 = p

3. Now plug p=15 into the second equation:
   20*15 + 36 + x = 22*(15 + 2)
   300 + 36 + x = 22*17
   336 + x = 374
   x = 374 - 336
   x = 38

The ground truth answer is indeed 38, while the proposed answer is 12. These are clearly different numbers.
