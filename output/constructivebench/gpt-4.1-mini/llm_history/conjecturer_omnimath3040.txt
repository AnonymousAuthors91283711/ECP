The error occurs because "fun n => 16" is a function from ℕ to ℕ, but omnimath3040_answer is expected to be a natural number, not a function. Since the problem asks for a fixed answer P+Q+R, the answer should be a natural number representing the sum.

From the problem, we have an equation:

100*P + 7*10 + R + (300 + 9*10 + R) = 100*R + 10*Q + 0

Simplify constants:

100*P + 70 + R + 300 + 90 + R = 100*R + 10*Q

Sum left side constants: 70 + 300 + 90 = 460

So:

100P + 460 + 2R = 100R + 10Q

Rewrite:

100P + 460 + 2R = 100R + 10Q

Bring all terms to one side:

100P + 460 + 2R - 100R - 10Q = 0

100P + 460 - 98R - 10Q = 0

So:

100P + 460 = 98R + 10Q

Since P, Q, R are distinct digits less than 10.

Try to find integer solutions:

Enumerated answer hints the sum P+Q+R = 16.

So just write the answer as 16.

Hence the fix is:

<<<16>>>
