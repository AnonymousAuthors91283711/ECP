Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines two recursive sequences A and B with mutual dependence
2. We're given initial conditions A₀=A₁=A₂=0 and A₃=1
3. We need to find A₄

The ground truth answer is 6, while the proposed answer is 1.

Let's compute the values step by step:
- From hA at k=3: A₃ = (A₂ + A₄ + B₃)/3 → 1 = (0 + A₄ + B₃)/3 → A₄ + B₃ = 3
- From hB at k=3: B₃ = (B₂ + B₄ + A₃)/3 → B₃ = (B₂ + B₄ + 1)/3
- From hA at k=2: A₂ = (A₁ + A₃ + B₂)/3 → 0 = (0 + 1 + B₂)/3 → B₂ = -1
- From hB at k=2: B₂ = (B₁ + B₃ + A₂)/3 → -1 = (B₁ + B₃ + 0)/3 → B₁ + B₃ = -3
- From hA at k=1: A₁ = (A₀ + A₂ + B₁)/3 → 0 = (0 + 0 + B₁)/3 → B₁ = 0
- Therefore B₃ = -3 (from B₁ + B₃ = -3)
- Then A₄ = 3 - B₃ = 3 - (-3) = 6

The proposed answer (1) is incorrect. The correct answer is indeed 6.
