Explanation: For the set {x | a x² + b x ≥ 0} to equal the range of sqrt(a x² + b x), which is [0, ∞), the quadratic must be nonnegative exactly where sqrt is defined and real-valued. This occurs only when a > 0 and the quadratic discriminant condition and domain make the sets equal. Given the problem's nature, the set of such a values is finite. Through analysis, the possible a values are exactly 1 and 0 (but 0 doesn't satisfy the conditions). Hence, only a = 1 fits, so the cardinality is 1.
