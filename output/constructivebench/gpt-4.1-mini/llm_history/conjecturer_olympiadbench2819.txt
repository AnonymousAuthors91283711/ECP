<<<(1/32)^2 * (2 + 15)>>>
Explanation: The sum over pairs (a,b) with a+b=12 or 20, with weights p a and p b, gives contributions mostly (1/32)^2, except when a or b=17 where p(17)=1/2 occurs. Checking pairs summing to 20 (1 to 17), only (3,17) and (17,3) contribute with p(17)=1/2, p(3)=1/32, and pairs summing to 12 contribute with p(a)=1/32 for a=1..11. Total count is 2 (for sum=20 pairs) plus 15 (for sum=12 pairs). Hence, answer is (1/32)^2 * 17.
