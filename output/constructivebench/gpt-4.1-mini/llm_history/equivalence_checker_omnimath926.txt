Ground Truth Answer: {-(5 * Real.pi) / 12, -(Real.pi) / 12, (Real.pi) / 12, (5 * Real.pi) / 12}
Proposed Answer: {x : ℝ | -Real.pi / 2 < x ∧ x < Real.pi / 2 ∧ (x = Real.arcsin (1 / 2) ∨ x = Real.arcsin (-1 / 2))}
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. First, let's simplify the equation from the problem:
   1 - sin⁴x - cos²x = 1/16
   Using sin²x + cos²x = 1, we can rewrite this as:
   sin²x(1 - sin²x) = 15/16
   Let y = sin²x, then:
   y(1 - y) = 15/16 ⇒ y - y² = 15/16 ⇒ 16y² - 16y + 15 = 0
   Solving this quadratic gives y = 3/4 or y = 5/4 (invalid since sin²x ≤ 1)
   So sin²x = 3/4 ⇒ sinx = ±√3/2 ⇒ x = ±π/3 + 2πn or ±2π/3 + 2πn

2. Within the interval (-π/2, π/2), the solutions are x = ±π/3

3. The ground truth answer gives ±π/12 and ±5π/12, which are incorrect as they don't satisfy sinx = ±√3/2

4. The proposed answer gives x = arcsin(±1/2), which corresponds to x = ±π/6, which is also incorrect since it should be x = ±π/3

Both answers are incorrect, but they're incorrect in different ways. The ground truth answer lists wrong values, while the proposed answer has the right approach but wrong numerical values (should be arcsin(±√3/2) instead of arcsin(±1/2)).
