Ground Truth Answer: 343/8
Proposed Answer: (21 : ℚ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines three variables Ea, Eb, Ec in sequence, each building on the previous one.
2. The calculation steps would be:
   - Ea = (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6 = 21/6 = 7/2
   - Eb = (7/2) * (21)/6 = (7/2)*(7/2) = 49/4
   - Ec = (49/4)*(21)/6 = (49/4)*(7/2) = 343/8
3. The ground truth answer is indeed 343/8
4. The proposed answer is just 21, which is clearly different from 343/8 (which equals 42.875)

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the ground truth answer of 343/8.
