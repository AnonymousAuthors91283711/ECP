Ground Truth Answer: 14
Proposed Answer: 16
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us an identity that must hold for all real x: (x + a)(x + 8) = x² + b x + 24

2. Let's expand the left side:
(x + a)(x + 8) = x² + (8 + a)x + 8a

3. Setting this equal to the right side:
x² + (8 + a)x + 8a = x² + b x + 24

4. For this to hold for all x, the coefficients must be equal:
- Coefficient of x: 8 + a = b
- Constant term: 8a = 24 ⇒ a = 3

5. Substituting a = 3 into the first equation:
8 + 3 = b ⇒ b = 11

6. Therefore, a + b = 3 + 11 = 14

The ground truth answer is correct (14), while the proposed answer is 16, which is incorrect.
