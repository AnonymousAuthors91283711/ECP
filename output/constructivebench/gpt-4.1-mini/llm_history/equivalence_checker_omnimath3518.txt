abbrev omnimath3518_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3518 (input : ℕ) : 
  ((input - 8) / 2) + 16 = 32 ↔ input = omnimath3518_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 40
Proposed Answer: 48
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation given is: ((input - 8) / 2) + 16 = 32
2. Let's solve it step by step:
   - Subtract 16 from both sides: (input - 8)/2 = 16
   - Multiply both sides by 2: input - 8 = 32
   - Add 8 to both sides: input = 40

The ground truth answer correctly solves the equation to get input = 40.

The proposed answer claims input = 48, which is incorrect based on the algebraic solution.

<<<False>>>
