The sum ∑ k in range n of (-1)^(k+1) is a well-known alternating series of 1's and -1's starting with positive 1 when k=0 (since (-1)^(1) = -1, but indexing from 0 is zero-based, we check carefully). For k from 0 to n-1,

(-1)^(k+1) = -(-1)^k

So the sum from k=0 to n-1 of (-1)^(k+1) = - sum from k=0 to n-1 of (-1)^k.

The sum of (-1)^k for k=0 to n-1 is 1 if n odd, 0 if n even.

But let's confirm via a quick pattern:

If n=1: sum k=0 to 0 of (-1)^(k+1) = (-1)^1 = -1

If n=2: sum k=0 to 1 of (-1)^(k+1) = (-1)^1 + (-1)^2 = -1 + 1 = 0

If n=3: sum = -1 + 1 -1 = -1

If n=4: sum = -1 + 1 -1 + 1 = 0

Pattern is: sum = 0 if n even; -1 if n odd.

So the closed form is:

if n is even then 0 else -1

In Lean, this can be written as:

if n % 2 = 0 then 0 else -1

Hence:

<<<fun n : ℕ => if n % 2 = 0 then 0 else -1>>>
