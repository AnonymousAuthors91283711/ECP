Ground Truth Answer: 1003
Proposed Answer: 2003 * 2002 / 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of triples (t.card) under certain constraints involving distances and parity conditions on a cyclic group of order 2006.

2. The ground truth answer is 1003, which suggests the solution involves some pairing or symmetry consideration in the cyclic group.

3. The proposed answer is 2003*2002/2 = 2005003, which is the number of possible pairs (combinations of 2003 elements taken 2 at a time). This appears to be counting something much larger than the actual solution.

4. The constraints in the problem, particularly the parity conditions and distance requirements, would significantly reduce the number of valid triples from the proposed answer.

5. 1003 is exactly half of 2006 (rounded down), which makes sense for a parity-based constraint in a cyclic group.
