Ground Truth Answer: {1}
Proposed Answer: {n | n % 2 = 1}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for which natural numbers n there exists an integer x such that x^n + (2 + x)^n + (2 - x)^n = 0.

2. Ground truth answer is {1} (only n=1 satisfies the condition).

3. Proposed answer is {n | n % 2 = 1} (all odd natural numbers).

Testing the equation:
- For n=1: x + (2+x) + (2-x) = x + 2 + x + 2 - x = x + 4 = 0 when x = -4. So n=1 works.
- For n=3: Let's test x=0: 0 + 8 + 8 = 16 ≠ 0. For x=1: 1 + 27 + 1 = 29 ≠ 0. For x=-1: -1 + 1 + 27 = 27 ≠ 0. No solution exists for n=3.
- Similar tests show no solutions exist for other odd n > 1.

The proposed answer incorrectly includes all odd numbers, while only n=1 satisfies the condition.
