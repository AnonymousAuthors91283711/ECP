Ground Truth Answer: 405
Proposed Answer: 100 * 5 + 3
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem is asking for two real numbers r1 and r2 that satisfy certain root conditions, then to compute their sum, express it as a reduced fraction a/b, and finally compute 100*a + b.

2. The ground truth answer is 405, which would correspond to a=4 and b=5 (since 100*4 + 5 = 405).

3. The proposed answer suggests 100*5 + 3 = 503, which is different from 405.

4. The sum of r1 and r2 given in the problem is (-5) + (-14/3) = -29/3, which would indeed be represented as a=-29, b=3 in reduced form. However, 100*(-29) + 3 would be negative, which doesn't match either answer.

There seems to be multiple issues:
- The proposed answer (503) doesn't match the ground truth (405)
- Neither matches the actual calculation based on the given r1 and r2
- The problem might have additional constraints not shown here
