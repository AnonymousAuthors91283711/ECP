The problem involves characterizing all real numbers y attainable as f(2017) for functions f: ℝ → ℝ satisfying P f ↔ ∀ x y, f x * f y = f (x - y).

Analyzing the functional equation f(x)f(y) = f(x - y), try special values:

- Set y = 0: f(x)f(0) = f(x), so f(0) = 1 if f is not identically zero.
- Set x = y = 0: f(0)² = f(0) ⇒ f(0)² = f(0), so f(0) = 0 or 1.
- If f(0) = 0, for any x, f(x) * 0 = f(x), so f(x) = 0 for all x (zero function).
- If f(0) = 1, then f(x)f(y) = f(x - y).

Using substitution g(x) := ln|f(x)| if f(x) ≠ 0, the equation becomes f(x)f(y) = f(x - y). If f is never zero, then f(x - y) = f(x)f(y) meaning the form of f is exponential in the difference variable x - y.

But this doesn't fully settle the form; however, considering that zeros appear, and f(0) = 0 or 1, and the problem domain is real-valued functions on ℝ, the only solutions are f = 0 or constant functions with f(x) ≡ c and c² = c ⇒ c=0 or 1.

Check if functions of form f(x) = c exp(a x) satisfy f(x)f(y) = f(x - y):

f(x)f(y) = c² exp(a(x + y)) ≠ c exp(a(x - y)) unless a=0 and c² = c.

So the only solutions are f(x) ≡ 0, or f(x) ≡ 1.

Consequently, the values y = f(2017) attainable are {0, 1}.

Hence the answer set is {0,1}.

In Lean syntax, sets of ℝ elements are represented with Set ℝ, so answer is:

{0} ∪ {1} = {0,1}.

No function-valued sets inside a set of ℝ make sense; the problem wants the image of f(2017) for functions f satisfying P, a subset of ℝ.

The original candidate set was malformed and misused function notation in Set ℝ.

Final Lean expression is the correct set {0, 1}.
