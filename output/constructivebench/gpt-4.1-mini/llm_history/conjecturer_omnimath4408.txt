Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 76, which is at " ∈ S, a < b ∧ b < c " in "abbrev omnimath4408_answer : Prop := ∃ S : Finset ℕ, S.card = 1983 ∧ ∀ a b c ∈ S, a < b ∧ b < c → c - b ≠ b - a ∧ ∀ n ∈ S, 0 < n ∧ n ≤ 10 ^ 5", there is an error: unexpected token '∈'; expected ','.

The error arises because Lean does not support multiple binders with the "∈" notation for multiple variables at once in a `∀` quantifier. Instead, we need to explicitly quantify each variable individually and state their membership separately. Also, the order and grouping of predicates in `∀` should be clear and well-typed: separate the conditions that bind variables in S and the inequalities clearly.

Furthermore, since you're representing a property about a finite set S with cardinality 1983 contained in integers between 1 and 10^5 with no three-term arithmetic progression, the best way to rewrite the answer in Lean syntax is:

- Use `∃ S : Finset ℕ,`
- State `S.card = 1983`
- State `∀ n ∈ S, 0 < n ∧ n ≤ 10^5`
- State `∀ a b c, a ∈ S → b ∈ S → c ∈ S → a < b → b < c → c - b ≠ b - a`

This explicit separation fixes the syntax error and matches the logical meaning.

Hence the fixed answer is:

<<<
∃ S : Finset ℕ,
  S.card = 1983 ∧
  (∀ n ∈ S, 0 < n ∧ n ≤ 10 ^ 5) ∧
  ∀ a b c : ℕ, a ∈ S → b ∈ S → c ∈ S → a < b → b < c → c - b ≠ b - a
