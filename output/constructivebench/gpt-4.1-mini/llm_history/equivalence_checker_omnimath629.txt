Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 2^(2 * n)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 3 ^ n
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting the number of triples (A, B, C) where:
   - A ⊆ B ⊆ {1,...,n}
   - C is any subset of {1,...,n} that contains the complement of A (Sn \ A)

2. For each element x ∈ {1,...,n}, there are 3 possibilities for its inclusion in A and B:
   - Not in A (and thus not in B)
   - In A (and thus in B)
   - In B but not in A

3. For C, since it must contain all elements not in A, for each element:
   - If x ∈ A: it can be either in C or not
   - If x ∉ A: it must be in C

4. The ground truth answer 2^(2n) accounts for:
   - For each element, 2 choices for whether it's in B\A or A (since A ⊆ B)
   - And 2 choices for whether it's in C (but constrained by A's complement)

5. The proposed answer 3^n would only count the number of ways to assign each element to A, B\A, or neither, but doesn't properly account for the constraints on C.

The proposed answer undercounts the possibilities because it doesn't consider the independent choices for C when elements are in A.
