The error arises because α is a variable, introduced as a hypothesis in the theorem, and so it cannot be used as a global constant in the answer definition, which must be closed. Instead, olympiadbench2915_answer must be made a function of α (and possibly B, C if needed), or it can be defined inside the theorem using the parameter α. Since the polynomial is factorized into (x - 2α)(x - (cos α)^2)(x + (1/(sin α))^2), evaluating at x=5 gives the value (5 - 2α)(5 - (cos α)^2)(5 + (1/(sin α))^2). The closed form is the function:

fun α => (5 - 2*α) * (5 - (Real.cos α)^2) * (5 + (1 / (Real.sin α))^2)

This matches the factorization and is an expression in ℝ → ℝ, so the value at 5 for given α is this function applied to α.

The error is caused because the proposed answer is a function from α : ℝ to ℝ, while the expected type is ℝ (a real number), not a function. The problem statement uses a fixed α in the polynomial factorization, and then evaluates the polynomial at 5. Therefore, the answer should be a real number that depends on the parameters B, C, and α given by the factorization.

From the hypothesis, the polynomial factors as (x - 2α)(x - (cos α)^2)(x + (1 / (sin α))^2). Evaluating this polynomial at 5 yields exactly the product:

(5 - 2 * α) * (5 - (cos α)^2) * (5 + (1 / (sin α))^2)

Therefore the answer is this expression as a real number (type ℝ) given α fixed. The problem likely treats α as a parameter fixed in the hypothesis, so olympiadbench2915_answer should be of type ℝ but depends on α. Since olympiadbench2915_answer is declared as ℝ without explicit arguments, it cannot be a function. To fix this, we must introduce α first, or leave the answer as the value for a fixed α.

Because the theorem has α as an argument, we consider olympiadbench2915_answer as a function of α, or making it a function is an option. However, if we want olympiadbench2915_answer to be an ℝ, we must either fix α or keep α as a parameter outside.

Thus, the best fix is to remove "fun α : ℝ =>" and leave it as just the expression, assuming α is fixed. So the correct expression is:

(5 - 2 * α) * (5 - (Real.cos α)^2) * (5 + (1 / (Real.sin α))^2)

But because α is not given as a fixed value here, the best is to keep olympiadbench2915_answer as a function from ℝ to ℝ.

Alternatively, define:

noncomputable abbrev olympiadbench2915_answer (α : ℝ) : ℝ := (5 - 2 * α) * (5 - (Real.cos α)^2) * (5 + (1 / (Real.sin α))^2)

But the problem requires olympiadbench2915_answer : ℝ (not a function).

Therefore, the solution is to leave α as a parameter in the theorem, and the answer as a function of α, or else hardcode α if known. If we want to keep olympiadbench2915_answer : ℝ, we must remove the function expression and just return the value at specific α.

Since the statement involves a universal quantification over α, it's better to postpone α's dependency to the theorem, not the answer. So the final answer should be:

(5 - 2 * α) * (5 - (cos α)^2) * (5 + (1 / (sin α))^2)

The Lean syntax to refer to real functions cos and sin from the Real namespace is Real.cos α, Real.sin α.

In fact, simply write:

(5 - 2 * α) * (5 - (Real.cos α)^2) * (5 + (1 / (Real.sin α))^2)

No fun abstraction around α.

So the fixed expression is:

. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Explanation: The error is because olympiadbench2915_answer is defined as a closed term of type ℝ, but it uses the variable α, which is free and not bound in that context. To fix this, we must define olympiadbench2915_answer as a function of α (and possibly B, C) because the value depends on α. Since B and C are determined by the factorization in the hypothesis, the expression for the polynomial at 5 given the factorization is exactly (5 - 2 * α) * (5 - (cos α)^2) * (5 + (1 / (sin α))^2). Thus, the final answer is a function of α, represented in Lean as follows:
