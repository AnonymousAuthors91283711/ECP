Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: (4 : ℚ)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the ratio n/p given certain conditions about quadratic polynomials and their roots.

2. The conditions state that:
   - The first polynomial X² + pX + m has roots {r, s}
   - The second polynomial X² + mX + n has roots {2r, 2s}

3. From Vieta's formulas:
   - For first polynomial: r + s = -p and r*s = m
   - For second polynomial: 2r + 2s = -m and (2r)*(2s) = n

4. From the sum of roots in second polynomial: -m = 2(r+s) = 2(-p) ⇒ m = 2p

5. From the product in second polynomial: n = 4rs = 4m (since rs = m from first polynomial)
   But since m = 2p, n = 4*2p = 8p ⇒ n/p = 8

The ground truth answer is 8, while the proposed answer is 4. The correct ratio should indeed be 8 based on the derivation.
