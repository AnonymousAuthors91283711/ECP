Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => 2 * x^2 + y^2
Proposed Answer: fun x y => 2 * (8 - y^3 - 6 * x * y)^(2 / 3) + y^2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find the minimum value of the expression 2a² + b² under given constraints (a³ + b³ + 6ab = 8 with a,b ≥ 0).

2. The ground truth answer provides the expression to be minimized directly: 2x² + y².

3. The proposed answer attempts to express x in terms of y using the constraint, resulting in a more complicated expression: 2*(8 - y³ - 6xy)^(2/3) + y².

The proposed answer is problematic because:
- It doesn't actually solve for the minimum value
- It creates a circular definition where x appears on both sides
- The expression (8 - y³ - 6xy)^(2/3) is not equivalent to x² from the original constraint

The ground truth answer correctly identifies the quantity we're trying to minimize, while the proposed answer doesn't provide a valid solution to the minimization problem.
