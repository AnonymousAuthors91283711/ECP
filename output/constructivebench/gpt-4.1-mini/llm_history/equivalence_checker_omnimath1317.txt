Ground Truth Answer: Icc (-9/2) (-2) ∪ Ioo ((1 - sqrt 5)/2) ((1 + sqrt 5)/2)
Proposed Answer: {x : ℝ | x < -9/2 ∨ x > -2}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is solving the inequality (x+1)/(x+2) > (3x+4)/(2x+9) with conditions x ≠ -2 and x ≠ -9/2.

2. The ground truth answer correctly identifies three intervals where the inequality holds:
   - Between -9/2 and -2 (Icc (-9/2) (-2))
   - Between (1-√5)/2 and (1+√5)/2 (Ioo ((1 - sqrt 5)/2) ((1 + sqrt 5)/2))

3. The proposed answer only includes x < -9/2 or x > -2, which:
   - Correctly includes the x < -9/2 case
   - Incorrectly includes all x > -2 (when actually only part of this interval satisfies the inequality)
   - Misses the important interval between -9/2 and -2

The proposed answer is partially correct but misses one interval and incorrectly includes part of another. Therefore, it's not equivalent to the ground truth answer.
