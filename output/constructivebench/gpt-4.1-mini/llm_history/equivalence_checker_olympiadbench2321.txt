Ground Truth Answer: 623
Proposed Answer: 153
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a 3-digit odd number (100-999) where:
   - All digits are distinct
   - The hundreds digit equals the product of tens and units digits (d2 = d1 * d0)

2. Ground truth answer is 623:
   - 6 = 2 * 3 (satisfies digit product condition)
   - All digits distinct
   - Odd number (3 is odd)

3. Proposed answer is 153:
   - 1 = 5 * 3 → 1 = 15 is false (doesn't satisfy digit product condition)
   - While it's a 3-digit odd number with distinct digits, it fails the key digit product requirement

The proposed answer fails to satisfy the main condition of the problem, while the ground truth answer does. Therefore, they are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
