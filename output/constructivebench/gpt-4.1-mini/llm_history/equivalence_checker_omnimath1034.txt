Ground Truth Answer: 216
Proposed Answer: 24
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting the number of 4×4 binary matrices where:
   - Each row has exactly 2 true and 2 false entries
   - Each column has exactly 2 true and 2 false entries

2. The ground truth answer is 216, which is correct for counting all possible 4×4 0-1 matrices with exactly two 1s in each row and column. This is a known combinatorics problem (count of 4×4 0-1 matrices with row and column sums equal to 2).

3. The proposed answer is 24, which is incorrect. 24 would be the count if we were counting permutation matrices (matrices with exactly one 1 in each row and column), but that's not what's being asked here.

The correct count is indeed 216, as this counts all possible ways to arrange two 1s in each row while maintaining two 1s in each column, which is larger than just permutation matrices.
