Ground Truth Answer: {5, 37}
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | n > 1 ∧ (n + 8)^2 = (n^2 + 7*n + 136) / (n - 1)}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all natural numbers n > 1 where (n² + 7n + 136)/(n-1) is a perfect square.

2. Ground truth gives the explicit solutions {5, 37}.

3. Proposed answer gives a condition (n + 8)² = (n² + 7n + 136)/(n - 1).

Let's verify if the proposed condition leads to the same solutions:

Rewriting the proposed condition:
(n + 8)² = (n² + 7n + 136)/(n - 1)
(n + 8)²(n - 1) = n² + 7n + 136

Expanding:
(n² + 16n + 64)(n - 1) = n² + 7n + 136
n³ + 15n² + 48n - 64 = n² + 7n + 136
n³ + 14n² + 41n - 200 = 0

Testing n=5:
125 + 350 + 205 - 200 = 480 ≠ 0
Wait, this suggests n=5 doesn't satisfy the proposed equation, but we know it's in the ground truth.

This means the proposed answer is missing solutions. The condition (n + 8)² = ... is too restrictive and excludes valid solutions like n=5 where the right side is a perfect square but not necessarily (n + 8)².
