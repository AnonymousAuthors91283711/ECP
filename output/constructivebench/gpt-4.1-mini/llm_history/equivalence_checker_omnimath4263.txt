Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | (n = 1) ∨ (Nat.Prime n)}
Proposed Answer: {1, 2}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
We're looking for natural numbers n > 0 where there exists exactly one integer a satisfying:
1. 0 ≤ a < n!
2. n! divides (a^n + 1)

Ground Truth Answer:
The solution set is all prime numbers and 1.

Proposed Answer:
Only {1, 2}

Evaluation:
1. For n=1:
   - a must satisfy 0 ≤ a < 1 and 1 divides (a+1) ⇒ only a=0 works
   - Correctly included in both answers

2. For n=2:
   - a must satisfy 0 ≤ a < 2 and 2 divides (a²+1)
   - Possible a: 1 (since 1²+1=2 is divisible by 2)
   - Only one solution, correctly included in both answers

3. For n=3 (prime):
   - a must satisfy 0 ≤ a < 6 and 6 divides (a³+1)
   - Solutions: a=1 (1+1=2 not divisible), a=2 (8+1=9 not divisible), a=3 (27+1=28 not divisible), a=4 (64+1=65 not divisible), a=5 (125+1=126 divisible by 6)
   - Only a=5 works ⇒ should be included but missing in proposed answer

4. For n=4 (composite):
   - Checking shows no unique solution exists ⇒ correctly excluded in both

The proposed answer misses all primes >2, while the ground truth correctly includes them.
