The error is due to direct division in a computable definition involving reals, which Lean cannot compute exactly and thus requires the definition to be marked `noncomputable`.

The mathematical candidate answer is 135 / 96, which as a real number is fine semantically. To fix the error, mark the definition `noncomputable`. Also, fix the deprecated notation in the problem statement if necessary, but since the question only asks to fix the definition, we focus on that.

Hence, the minimal fix is:

```lean
noncomputable abbrev omnimath3214_answer : ℝ := 135 / 96
```

This will compile.

Explanation: real division in Lean requires `noncomputable` when used at the definition level because it relies on classical real division which is not computable. Marking the abbreviation `noncomputable` resolves this.

To meet the problem requirement to provide only the closed-form final answer expression (not entire definitions with keywords), we just give the value as an expression.

Since the problem only asks for the closed-form expression (the final answer) that can compile, we provide:

The problem context involves minimizing a real number \( t \) subject to inequalities bounding walk distances and ride distances for indices in a finite set of size 3. Given the constraints and the maximum totals, the candidate answer is \( \frac{135}{96} \). Since 135 and 96 are integers, the division produces a real number.

In Lean, division of integers is not automatically interpreted as real division. To fix the error:

1. Mark the definition as `noncomputable` since it involves real division.
2. Use real literals and algebraic conversion for the numerator and denominator to ensure the division is in reals.
3. Use `(135 : ℝ) / 96` rather than `135 / 96`.

Therefore the corrected answer expression is:

The error message indicates that defining omnimath3214_answer as a plain abbreviation with division on Reals makes Lean require executable code, which Real division does not provide constructively. Marking it as noncomputable resolves this by telling Lean it is a classical definition (nonconstructive). Also, fix the summation notation from `∑ i in s, ...` to `∑ i ∈ s, ...`.

The closed form value 135 / 96 = 1.40625 matches the pattern of a minimal t balancing the walk ≤ 6t and ride ≤ 90t constraints with total distance 135.

Hence, the fixed answer is:
