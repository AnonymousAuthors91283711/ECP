. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)
Explanation: The error happens because `{(a, b, c, d) | ...}` notation in Lean expects `a, b, c, d` to be fixed variables in scope, but here they are bound variables inside the set comprehension—Lean does not implicitly bind those variables in that notation. Instead, we use set-builder notation with explicit λ abstraction: `Set.image` or built-in `Set` constructor with `λ`. Alternatively, use `Set` defined as the union of the three singleton sets with the ordering constraints folded into the propositions inside combinations of the tuples.

A cleaner way is to define the set as the finite union of three explicitly listed tuples (which form a subset of ℕ×ℕ×ℕ×ℕ) as:

```lean
{(2, 5, 8, 10), (4, 5, 7, 10), (1, 8, 9, 10)}
```

and then intersect with the ordering condition, or just include it in the sets if it already holds.

Since all enumerated candidate tuples indeed have `a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d`, we can just define the set as the set of these three tuples.

In Lean, the notation `{x, y, z}` builds a `Finset` but not a `Set`. To build a `Set` from explicit elements, use `Set.insert` and `Set.singleton`, or just write down the explicit union of singleton sets.

Thus, the corrected version is:

```lean
{(2, 5, 8, 10)} ∪ {(4, 5, 7, 10)} ∪ {(1, 8, 9, 10)}
```

Finally, this is a closed form, finite answer set as requested.

Hence the final answer is:

<<<
{(2, 5, 8, 10)} ∪ {(4, 5, 7, 10)} ∪ {(1, 8, 9, 10)}
