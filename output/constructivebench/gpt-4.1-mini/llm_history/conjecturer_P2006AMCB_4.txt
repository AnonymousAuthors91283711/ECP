The error arises because the division and absolute value operations on real numbers in Lean require marking the definition as `noncomputable`, since these operations on `ℝ` are not computable functions in Lean's core calculus. To fix this, you should add the `noncomputable` keyword before the definition.

In addition, the current candidate answer expression has unnecessary outer absolute value since the theorem already uses the difference with the answer inside an absolute value, and the least value is 0. However, since the problem asks for the absolute difference minimized to 0, returning the exact percentage difference without absolute value should be fine.

Finally, we can write the answer clearly as the percentage leftover change after summing the known costs from 20 dollars.

The fixed and compile-able Lean expression is:

Explanation:  
The original error occurs because the user combines `abbrev` with `noncomputable def` incorrectly, which is invalid syntax in Lean. `abbrev` directly assigns a definitional term without the need to declare it as `noncomputable def`. Since all numbers involved are constants of type `ℝ` (likely coerced literals), the expression is computable and can be defined simply as an abbrev term.

This expression computes the percentage difference between the remaining change (20 minus the sum of prices) and 20 dollars; and then expresses it as a percentage. The formula:  
\[
\frac{20 - (7.99 + 4.99 + 2.99 + 1.99 + 0.99)}{20} \times 100
\]

is the correct closed form expected as the answer. This matches the enumerated answers and fits the problem statement exactly.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The problem arises because Lean's real numbers (ℝ) are defined axiomatically and division is not computable by default, so direct use of division or real literals without marking as noncomputable causes an error. To fix this, we can mark the definition as noncomputable.

Also, since the answer is a real constant, you should mark the abbreviation as noncomputable to avoid the compilation error due to real division and real literals.

Thus the fixed final answer is the same expression, but marked noncomputable.

The error you encountered is because real number division in Lean requires marking the definition as noncomputable due to the way division on ℝ is implemented (as it is not computable in the standard sense).

To fix the problem, you should mark your answer as noncomputable, so Lean understands this uses noncomputable real operations (real division).

Also, the answer naturally is the percentage of the change, which is exactly computed as given.

Thus, the corrected answer is the same expression, but wrapped into a `noncomputable` declaration, i.e., write `noncomputable abbrev`.

In the snippet below, I write the expression inside the delimiters that you requested, and you can prepend `noncomputable abbrev P2006AMCB_4_answer : ℝ :=` before it in your code.
