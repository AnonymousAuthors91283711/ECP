Ground Truth Answer: choose 100 50 * 2^98
Proposed Answer: 2 ^ 100 * 50! / (50 - 100)!
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
1. We're counting injective functions from Fin 100 to Fin 2 × Fin 50 with specific constraints
2. The constraints require that for each non-zero i, there exists a j < i where:
   - The first components match (f j).1 = (f i).1
   - The second components are consecutive (differ by 1)

Answer Analysis:
- Ground Truth: choose 100 50 * 2^98
  - choose 100 50 selects 50 positions out of 100 for one color (Fin 2)
  - 2^98 accounts for the remaining choices (with constraints)
  
- Proposed Answer: 2^100 * 50! / (50 - 100)!
  - 2^100 would be for unrestricted Fin 2 choices
  - 50!/(50-100)! is P(50,100) which is invalid (permutation of 100 from 50)
  - The denominator (50-100)! is invalid for factorial definition

The proposed answer is mathematically invalid due to the permutation term and doesn't match the combinatorial structure of the problem. The ground truth answer correctly captures the constraints.
