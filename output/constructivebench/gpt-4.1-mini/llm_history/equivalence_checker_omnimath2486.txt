Ground Truth Answer: 5 / 27
Proposed Answer: 1/6
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the sum of an alternating series ∑' n, (-1)^(n+1) * a n given certain conditions about the sequence aₙ.

2. The conditions involve:
   - aₙ > 0 for all n
   - For each k, the sum ∑' n, choose(n,k)*aₙ = (1/5)ᵏ

3. The ground truth answer is 5/27 ≈ 0.185185
4. The proposed answer is 1/6 ≈ 0.166667

To verify:
- The generating function approach would be appropriate here
- The condition suggests the exponential generating function of aₙ is related to e^(x/5)
- The alternating sum would correspond to evaluating at x = -1
- The correct calculation indeed leads to 5/27, not 1/6

The proposed answer is incorrect.
