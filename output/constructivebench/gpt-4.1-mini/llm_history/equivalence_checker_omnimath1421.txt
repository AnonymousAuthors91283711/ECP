Ground Truth Answer: (7, 1, 5, 2)
Proposed Answer: (10, 9, 5, 4)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for natural numbers a, b, c, d where:
   - The sum of absolute values of roots has form (a + b√c)/d
   - c is squarefree
   - a,b,d are pairwise coprime
   - The 4-digit number formed is the answer

2. Ground truth: (7, 1, 5, 2)
   - This gives (7 + 1√5)/2 ≈ 4.618
   - All conditions are satisfied

3. Proposed answer: (10, 9, 5, 4)
   - This gives (10 + 9√5)/4 ≈ 7.013
   - The values are not pairwise coprime (10 and 4 share factor 2)
   - The numerical value is different
   - Doesn't match the ground truth

The proposed answer fails both the coprimality condition and gives a different numerical result.

<<<False>>>
