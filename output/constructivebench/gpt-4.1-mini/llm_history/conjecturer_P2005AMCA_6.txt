abbrev P2005AMCA_6_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2005AMCA_6 :
  ∃ (t : ℝ), 0 < t ∧
  let josh_speed := (4/5) * (13 / t);
  let mike_speed := 13 / t;
  josh_speed * (2 * t) + mike_speed * t = 13 ∧
  mike_speed * t = P2005AMCA_6_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<(78 : ℝ)>>>
Explanation: Given mike_speed * t = 13, and josh_speed = (4/5) * mike_speed, the total distance is josh_speed * 2t + mike_speed * t = (4/5)*mike_speed*2t + mike_speed * t = (8/5 + 1)*mike_speed * t = (13/5)*13 = 78. Thus P2005AMCA_6_answer = 78.
