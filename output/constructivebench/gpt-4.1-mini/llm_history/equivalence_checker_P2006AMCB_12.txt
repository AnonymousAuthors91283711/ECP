Ground Truth Answer: fun p => 4 * p
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℝ => -2 * p
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem describes a quadratic function f(x) = ax² + bx + c with:
   - A maximum at x = p (vertex condition)
   - f(p) = p (vertex value condition)
   - f(0) = -p (y-intercept condition)

2. From the vertex condition (maximum at p), we know:
   - The derivative f'(p) = 0 ⇒ 2a*p + b = 0 ⇒ b = -2a*p

3. From the vertex value condition:
   a*p² + b*p + c = p

4. From the y-intercept condition:
   c = -p

5. Substituting c = -p into the vertex value condition:
   a*p² + b*p - p = p ⇒ a*p² + b*p = 2p

6. Substituting b = -2a*p from step 2:
   a*p² + (-2a*p)*p = 2p ⇒ a*p² - 2a*p² = 2p ⇒ -a*p² = 2p ⇒ a = -2/p (since p ≠ 0)

7. Now substitute a back into b = -2a*p:
   b = -2*(-2/p)*p = 4

The ground truth answer correctly gives b = 4p, while the proposed answer gives b = -2p. The proposed answer is incorrect based on the derivation.
