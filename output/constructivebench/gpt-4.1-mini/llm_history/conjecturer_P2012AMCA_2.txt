The problem asks for a natural number answer, but you gave a function `fun _ => 25`, which is a function type and not a natural number. You should provide just a natural number directly.

We want to evaluate (⌊300/20⌋ + ⌊300/30⌋) which is (15 + 10) = 25, so the answer should be `25` of type `ℕ`.

Thus the corrected answer is simply `25`.
