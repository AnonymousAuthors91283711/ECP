Ground Truth Answer: fun T => 125
Proposed Answer: fun T : ℕ => 2 * T + 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us T = 55 and asks us to find K that satisfies several conditions.

2. Ground truth answer: When T=55, K=125.

3. Proposed answer: K = 2*T + 9. When T=55, this gives K = 2*55 + 9 = 119.

Now let's check the conditions with T=55:
- First condition: 20 < 55-5 ∧ 55-5 < K → 20 < 50 ∧ 50 < K
- For K=125: 50 < 125 is true
- For K=119: 50 < 119 is true

But the critical part is the rational ratio condition:
- ∃ r > 1 such that 20*r = 50 and 50*r = K
- From 20*r = 50, we get r = 2.5
- Then 50*2.5 = 125 (matches ground truth)
- But 50*2.5 = 125 ≠ 119 (doesn't match proposed answer)

Therefore, the proposed answer doesn't satisfy all conditions.
