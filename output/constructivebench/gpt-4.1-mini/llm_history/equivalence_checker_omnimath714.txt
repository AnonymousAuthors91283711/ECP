Ground Truth Answer: 2 / 3
Proposed Answer: 3 / 4 - 1 / 4
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about calculating the probability that for a random point (a,b) in the unit square [0,1]×[0,1], the ratio c = a/(a+b) falls between 1/4 and 3/4.

2. The ground truth answer is 2/3 ≈ 0.666..., which is correct based on geometric probability calculations.

3. The proposed answer is 3/4 - 1/4 = 1/2 = 0.5, which is different from the correct answer.

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the correct probability calculation.

<<<False>>>
