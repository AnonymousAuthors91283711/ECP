Explanation: The problem boils down to finding the greatest natural number n such that n + 1 divides 840!. The largest such n is 840! - 1. So, P2003AIMEI_1_answer = 840! - 1. However, since k * (n + 1) = 840!, for some positive k, n+1 must divide 840!, hence n+1 is a divisor of 840!, and n = divisor - 1. The largest n satisfies n+1 = 840! itself, so n = 840! - 1. Thus: 840! - 1. In Lean: 840! - 1. But since Lean expects a natural number, and factorial returns ℕ, we can write (Factorial 840) - 1. So the answer is:

<<<(fact 840) - 1>>>
