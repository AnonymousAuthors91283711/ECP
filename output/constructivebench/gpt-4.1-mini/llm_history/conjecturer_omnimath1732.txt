. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ × ℤ)
The error arises because `x`, `y`, and `z` are defined as `let` expressions inside the set comprehension and Lean cannot infer the typeclass instance for membership `x ∈ {13,37,42}` since `x` is a metavariable depending on `a`, `b`, `c`. Also, the expression is too complicated and checking membership individually is redundant because the set on the left side is exactly the set {42, 13, 37} commuted arbitrarily.

The key insight is the set equality means the multiset (or set) of those three expressions equals {42, 13, 37}. Since the elements of the sets are the same, but possibly permuted, the solution set corresponds to triples `(a, b, c)` where the multiset { (a + b)/2 + c, (a + c)/2 + b, (b + c)/2 + a } equals exactly {13, 37, 42} as sets.

Because the expressions are linear combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c`, we want to characterize `(a,b,c)` such that these three values are exactly the three numbers 13,37,42 in some order.

Summing all three expressions:

((a + b)/2 + c) + ((a + c)/2 + b) + ((b + c)/2 + a) = ((a+b)+(a+c)+(b+c))/2 + (a + b + c)

Sum numerator: (a+b)+(a+c)+(b+c) = 2*(a + b + c)

So sum = 2*(a+b+c)/2 + (a + b + c) = (a+b+c) + (a+b+c) = 2*(a+b+c)

Thus sum of the three expressions is 2*(a + b + c).

On the other hand, the sum of the given set {13,37,42} is 92.

So 2*(a + b + c) = 92 => a + b + c = 46.

Now we have the constraint a + b + c = 46.

Next, denote the three expressions as:

x = (a+b)/2 + c

y = (a+c)/2 + b

z = (b+c)/2 + a

Note that x + y + z = 92.

The difference between expressions after substituting a + b + c = 46 can yield constraints.

Another perspective: define new variables s = a + b + c = 46.

From the three expressions:

x = (a + b)/2 + c = (s - c)/2 + c = (s + c)/2

Similarly:

y = (a + c)/2 + b = (s + b)/2

z = (b + c)/2 + a = (s + a)/2

So the set is { (s + a)/2, (s + b)/2, (s + c)/2 } = {13, 37, 42}.

Since s = 46:

{(46 + a)/2, (46 + b)/2, (46 + c)/2} = {13, 37, 42}.

Multiply both sides by 2:

{46 + a, 46 + b, 46 + c} = {26, 74, 84}.

Because sets are equal, we have that `{46 + a, 46 + b, 46 + c} = {26, 74, 84}`.

So {a, b, c} = {26 - 46, 74 - 46, 84 - 46} = {-20, 28, 38} in some order.

Therefore, the solution set is all triples `(a, b, c)` with entries a,b,c being permutations of the integers -20, 28, and 38.

Hence, the final answer set `omnimath1732_answer` can be expressed as the set of all triples `(a,b,c)` that are permutations of (-20, 28, 38).

This is straightforward to encode in Lean.
