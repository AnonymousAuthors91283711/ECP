Ground Truth Answer: 180
Proposed Answer: 3^5 * 2^5
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest positive integer n where:
   - There are exactly 6 odd divisors
   - There are exactly 12 even divisors

2. Key observations:
   - Total divisors = odd divisors + even divisors = 6 + 12 = 18
   - The number of divisors function is multiplicative
   - For odd divisors, we only consider the odd part of n
   - For even divisors, we consider the whole factorization but must include at least one factor of 2

3. Ground truth answer is 180:
   - Factorization: 2² × 3² × 5
   - Odd part: 3² × 5 → (2+1)(1+1) = 6 odd divisors
   - Total divisors: (2+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 18 → 12 even divisors (18-6)

4. Proposed answer is 3^5 * 2^5 = 7776:
   - Odd part: 3^5 → 5+1 = 6 odd divisors (correct)
   - Total divisors: (5+1)(5+1) = 36 → 30 even divisors (incorrect, should be 12)
   - Also, 7776 is much larger than the minimal solution 180

The proposed answer gives the correct number of odd divisors but fails for even divisors and isn't the minimal solution.
