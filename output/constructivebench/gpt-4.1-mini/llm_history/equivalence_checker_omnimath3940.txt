Ground Truth Answer: {(7, 1), (1, 7), (22, 22)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1), (1, 21), (3, 6), (6, 3), (21, 1), (1, 1)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all positive integer pairs (x,y) that satisfy:
   x > 0 ∧ y > 0 ∧ x³ + y³ = x² + 42xy + y²

2. Ground Truth Answer provides 3 pairs: (7,1), (1,7), and (22,22)

3. Proposed Answer provides 6 pairs: (1,1), (1,21), (3,6), (6,3), (21,1), (1,1)

Now let's verify some of these:

- For (7,1): 7³ + 1³ = 343 + 1 = 344
            7² + 42*7*1 + 1² = 49 + 294 + 1 = 344 ✓
- For (1,7): Symmetric case, also works ✓
- For (22,22): 22³ + 22³ = 2*10648 = 21296
               22² + 42*22*22 + 22² = 484 + 20328 + 484 = 21296 ✓

Now checking proposed answer:
- (1,1): 1+1 = 1+42+1 → 2 = 44 ✗ (doesn't satisfy)
- (1,21): 1+9261 = 1+882+441 → 9262 = 1324 ✗
- (3,6): 27+216 = 9+756+36 → 243 = 801 ✗
- (6,3): Symmetric case, also fails ✗
- (21,1): Same as (1,21) ✗
- (1,1): Already checked ✗

The proposed answer is completely incorrect as none of its pairs satisfy the equation (except for the duplicate (1,1) which fails). The ground truth answer is correct.

<<<False>>>
