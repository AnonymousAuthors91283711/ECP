Ground Truth Answer: 4.2
Proposed Answer: ((1 + 0.089) * (1 + 0.069) * (1 - 0.029) - 1) * 100
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer calculates the equivalent annual growth rate by combining the three individual growth rates (8.9%, 6.9%, and -2.9%) and converting them to a single annualized rate. While the formula is correct for calculating the equivalent rate, the result of this calculation is approximately 4.2% when computed precisely, which matches the ground truth answer. However, the proposed answer is expressed as a formula rather than the exact numerical value, so it's "Close" but not exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer of 4.2.
