The error is due to improperly using `univ = {c1, c2, c3}` which is trying to compare `Fin 3`'s entire universe with a manually constructed set `{c1, c2, c3}` written as a Lean set literal. In Lean, `{c1, c2, c3}` would not by default be interpreted as a `Finset` unless constructed properly, also `univ` here is presumably `Finset.univ : Finset (Fin 3)`, so you should compare `Finset.univ` with a finset such as `finset.insert c1 (finset.insert c2 (finset.singleton c3))`.

Thus, the fix is to replace `univ = {c1, c2, c3}` with `Finset.univ = Finset.insert c1 (Finset.insert c2 (Finset.singleton c3))`.

Also to define the answer as the natural number 36.

Hence the corrected final answer expression in Lean is simply `36`.
