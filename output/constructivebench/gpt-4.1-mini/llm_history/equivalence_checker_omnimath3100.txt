theorem omnimath3100 (total : ℕ) (g y r : ℕ) :
  g = 3 * (total / 9) ∧
  y = 4 * (total / 9) ∧
  r = 2 * (total / 9) ∧

  r = omnimath3100_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 18
Proposed Answer: 21
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. From the given theorem, we have:
   - g = 3*(total/9)
   - y = 4*(total/9)
   - r = 2*(total/9)
   - g + y = 63

2. Substituting g and y:
   3*(total/9) + 4*(total/9) = 63
   => 7*(total/9) = 63
   => total/9 = 9
   => total = 81

3. Now calculate r:
   r = 2*(total/9) = 2*9 = 18

The ground truth answer correctly follows this calculation to get r = 18. The proposed answer of 21 doesn't match this calculation.

<<<False>>>
