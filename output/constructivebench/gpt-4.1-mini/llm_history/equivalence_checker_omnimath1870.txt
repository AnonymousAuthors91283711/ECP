Ground Truth Answer: fun x y z => Real.sqrt 3
Proposed Answer: fun x y z => 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves logarithmic identities and exponents with variables x, y, z > 1.
2. The ground truth answer suggests that log y / log x = √3.
3. The proposed answer suggests log y / log x = 3.

Key observations:
- The ground truth answer (√3 ≈ 1.732) and proposed answer (3) are numerically different.
- From the given equations, we can derive relationships between the variables, but they don't simplify to either 3 or √3 directly.
- However, solving the system properly would show that the correct ratio is indeed √3, not 3.

The proposed answer is incorrect as it gives a different value than the ground truth.
