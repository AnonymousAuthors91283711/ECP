Ground Truth Answer: 400000
Proposed Answer: 700000 - 20 * 15000
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. Problem Analysis:
- We have 21 teams (Fin 21 → ℕ)
- Each team has at least 15000 (∀ p, 15000 ≤ team p)
- Total of all teams ≤ 700000 (∑ p, team p ≤ 700000)
- We need to find the maximum possible value for any single team

2. Ground Truth Answer:
- 400000 is given as the correct maximum

3. Proposed Answer Calculation:
700000 - 20 * 15000 = 700000 - 300000 = 400000

The proposed answer is exactly the calculation that leads to the ground truth answer. Here's why:
- To maximize one team, we minimize the other 20 teams
- Minimum for each of 20 teams is 15000
- So maximum for remaining team is 700000 - 20*15000 = 400000
