Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the least value of S where S = a/(1-r) under the constraints:
   - a*r = 1
   - |r| < 1
   - S > 0

2. From a*r = 1, we get a = 1/r. Substituting into S:
   S = (1/r)/(1-r) = 1/(r(1-r))

3. We need to minimize 1/(r(1-r)) under |r|<1.

4. The function f(r) = r(1-r) reaches its maximum at r=1/2 (by taking derivative), giving f(1/2)=1/4.

5. Therefore, the minimum S would be 1/(1/4) = 4.

The ground truth answer (4) is correct, while the proposed answer (2) is incorrect.
