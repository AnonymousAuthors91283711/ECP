Ground Truth Answer: {1331, 1728}
Proposed Answer: { n : ℕ | ∃ k m : ℕ, k > 0 ∧ k % 10 ≠ 0 ∧ n = k ^ 3 ∧ m ^ 3 = n / 1000 }
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is looking for natural numbers n that satisfy:
   - n is a perfect cube (k³ = n for some positive integer k)
   - n is not divisible by 10 (¬(10 ∣ n))
   - n/1000 is also a perfect cube (m³ = n/1000 for some integer m)

2. Ground truth gives explicit numbers: {1331, 1728}
   - 1331 = 11³, 1331/1000 = 1.331 which is 1.1³
   - 1728 = 12³, 1728/1000 = 1.728 which is 1.2³
   Both satisfy all conditions.

3. Proposed answer describes the set using conditions:
   - k > 0 (positive cube root)
   - k % 10 ≠ 0 (equivalent to ¬(10 ∣ n) since 10 = 2×5 and cubes preserve primality)
   - n = k³ (n is perfect cube)
   - m³ = n/1000 (n/1000 is perfect cube)

The proposed answer is mathematically equivalent to the problem statement, just expressed differently:
- The condition k % 10 ≠ 0 is equivalent to ¬(10 ∣ n) for cubes
- Using ℕ vs ℤ doesn't matter since we're dealing with cubes of positive numbers
- The conditions capture exactly the same requirements

The ground truth shows two examples that satisfy both the problem and the proposed answer's conditions.
