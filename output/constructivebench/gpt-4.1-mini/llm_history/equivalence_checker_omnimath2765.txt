abbrev omnimath2765_answer : ℚ → ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath2765 (n : ℚ) : 
  1/(2 * n) + 1/(4 * n) = 3/12 ↔ n = omnimath2765_answer 3 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℚ => 1 / (4 * x)
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem states an equation: 1/(2n) + 1/(4n) = 3/12
2. Simplifying left side: (2/4n + 1/4n) = 3/4n
3. Right side simplifies to 1/4
4. So we have 3/4n = 1/4 → 3 = n

The ground truth answer correctly shows that n must equal 3 (fun n => n is just the identity function, meaning n=3 is the solution).

The proposed answer (fun x => 1/(4x)) is incorrect because:
- It's a function rather than a specific value
- Even if evaluated at x=3, it gives 1/12, not 3
- The solution should be n=3, not a function of n
