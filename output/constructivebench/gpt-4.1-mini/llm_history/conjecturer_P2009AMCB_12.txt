The problem defines a geometric sequence geometric n = a * r^n satisfying geometric 5 = 7! and geometric 8 = 8!. From these two equations:

a * r^5 = 7! and a * r^8 = 8!

Dividing the second by the first, we get r^3 = 8! / 7! = 8, so r = 2.

Then a = 7! / r^5 = 7! / 2^5 = 7! / 32.

The candidate answer "7! / 5^5" is clearly inconsistent with this.

In Lean, 7! and 8! can be represented as Nat.factorial 7 and Nat.factorial 8 casted to ℝ.

Division on ℝ is not computable by default due to real analysis complexities. Marking the definition as noncomputable can resolve this.

Hence the corrected, generalized closed-form answer is:

a = (7!).to_real / (2^5)

Expressed in Lean with a noncomputable abbreviation to resolve division.

The error arises because dividing two real numbers using `/` in Lean may require marking the definition as `noncomputable` to allow for use of division in the reals, which depends on nonconstructive mathlib definitions.

Beyond that, the problem involves a geometric progression defined as geometric n = a * r^n, with geometric_5 = 7! and geometric_8 = 8!. From these, we need to solve for a in terms of the known factorials and powers of r.

From geometric_5 = a * r^5 = 7!
From geometric_8 = a * r^8 = 8!

Dividing the second by the first:

( a * r^8 ) / ( a * r^5 ) = 8! / 7! → r^3 = 8

Since 8 = 2^3, r = 2. Then from geometric_5 = a * 2^5 = 7!, so a = 7! / 2^5

Thus, the answer is a = (7! : ℝ) / 2^5

To fix the Lean error, mark the abbreviation as noncomputable. We can do it by writing

noncomputable abbrev P2009AMCB_12_answer : ℝ := (Nat.factorial 7 : ℝ) / (2 ^ 5)

This will fix the compilation error.

Hence, the final answer expression (without additional abbreviations and with the noncomputable keyword, which is allowed) is:

Explanation: From the conditions geometric 5 = 7! and geometric 8 = 8!, we have:
a * r^5 = 7! and a * r^8 = 8!.
Dividing these equations: (a * r^8) / (a * r^5) = 8! / 7! → r^3 = 8 → r = 2.
Then from a * 2^5 = 7! → a = 7! / 2^5.

Hence, the closed form answer for a is (7! / 2^5).

In Lean, factorial is Nat.factorial, exponentiation is (^), and coercion to ℝ is done by (↑). The keyword "noncomputable" cannot be placed inside an expression; it is used as a modifier to declarations.

Thus, the proper expression is:

The given problem involves a geometric sequence with terms given by geometric n = a * r^n. We know geometric 5 = 7! and geometric 8 = 8!. From these two equations:

a * r^5 = 7!
a * r^8 = 8!

Dividing the second by the first:
r^3 = (8!) / (7!) = 8

Hence, r = 2 (since r is real number and positive from the context).

Then from the first equation: a * 2^5 = 7! => a = 7! / 2^5

Therefore, the closed form of a is (7!)/(2^5), converted to ℝ.

The Lean error is because the expression depends on Real.instDivInvMonoid which is noncomputable, so we should mark P2009AMCB_12_answer as noncomputable or use 'noncomputable def' instead of 'abbrev'.

Thus, the correct definition would be:

noncomputable def P2009AMCB_12_answer : ℝ := (Nat.factorial 7 : ℝ) / 2 ^ 5

We only need to fix the definition to be noncomputable def to avoid the error.

Therefore the final answer in Lean is:

<<<noncomputable def P2009AMCB_12_answer : ℝ := (Nat.factorial 7 : ℝ) / 2 ^ 5>>>
