Ground Truth Answer: 32
Proposed Answer: (75 - 26)
<<<True>>>

Explanation:
1. The problem asks for the cardinality of the set of integer pairs (p₁, p₂) where:
   - p₂ = 4*p₁ + 3
   - 25 < p₁ < 75
   - 120 < p₂ < 250

2. The ground truth answer is 32, which is correct because:
   - p₁ must be integers from 26 to 74 (inclusive), giving 49 possible values
   - The p₂ constraints translate to:
     - 120 < 4*p₁ + 3 ⇒ p₁ > 117/4 ⇒ p₁ ≥ 30
     - 4*p₁ + 3 < 250 ⇒ p₁ < 247/4 ⇒ p₁ ≤ 61
   - So valid p₁ range is 30 to 61 (inclusive), giving 32 values

3. The proposed answer (75 - 26) = 49 is incorrect as it doesn't account for the p₂ constraints. However, the ground truth answer 32 is correct.

But wait - looking again, the proposed answer is actually (75 - 26) which equals 49, while the correct answer is 32. Therefore they are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
