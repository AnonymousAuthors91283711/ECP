Ground Truth Answer: (34).choose 9
Proposed Answer: Nat.choose (26 + 9 - 1) 9
<<<True>>>
The problem is asking for the number of multisets of size 9 where each element is from a set of 26 distinct elements (Fin 26). 

The ground truth answer uses the formula (34 choose 9), which is correct because:
- The number of k-combinations with repetition from a set of size n is given by (n+k-1 choose k)
- Here n=26 and k=9, so (26+9-1 choose 9) = (34 choose 9)

The proposed answer explicitly shows this calculation: Nat.choose (26 + 9 - 1) 9, which is exactly equivalent to (34 choose 9).

Both answers represent the same mathematical expression and are therefore equivalent.
