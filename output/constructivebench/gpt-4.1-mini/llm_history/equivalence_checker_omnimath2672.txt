Ground Truth Answer: 15
Proposed Answer: (30 : ℝ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have two equations:
   - q = (2/5)*p (from h₁)
   - p*q = 90 (from h₂)

2. Substituting the first equation into the second:
   p*(2/5)*p = 90
   (2/5)*p² = 90
   p² = 90*(5/2) = 225
   p = ±15

3. The ground truth answer is 15 (the positive solution)
4. The proposed answer is 30

The proposed answer (30) doesn't satisfy the original equations when substituted back:
- If p = 30, then q = (2/5)*30 = 12
- But p*q = 30*12 = 360 ≠ 90

The correct answer should be 15, not 30. They are not equivalent.
