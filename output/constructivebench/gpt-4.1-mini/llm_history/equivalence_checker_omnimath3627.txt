abbrev omnimath3627_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3627 :
  {a : ℝ | ∃ f : ℝ → ℝ, (∃ x : ℝ, f x ≠ x) ∧
    (∀ x : ℝ, f (a * x) = a ^ 2 * f x) ∧
    (∀ x : ℝ, f (f x) = a * f x)} = omnimath3627_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {0, 1}
Proposed Answer: {a : ℝ | a = 0 ∨ a = 1}
<<<True>>>
