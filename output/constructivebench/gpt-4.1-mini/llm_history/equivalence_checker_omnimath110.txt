theorem omnimath110 (f g : ℝ → ℝ) :
    (∀ x y, f (x + y * g x) = g x + x * f y) ↔ (f, g) ∈ omnimath110_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: { (0, 0) } ∪ { (f, g) | f = g ∧ f 0 = 0 }
Proposed Answer: {(f, g) | ∃ c : ℝ, f = (fun x => c * x) ∧ g = (fun x => c)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is a functional equation: ∀ x y, f(x + y*g(x)) = g(x) + x*f(y)

2. Ground Truth Answer includes two cases:
   - The zero functions (f,g) = (0,0)
   - All pairs where f = g and f(0) = 0

3. Proposed Answer claims all solutions are linear functions where:
   - f(x) = c*x
   - g(x) = c (constant function)

Comparison:
- The zero functions (0,0) are included in both answers (when c=0)
- The proposed answer's linear solutions satisfy f = g only when c=0 (since g would be constant but f would be linear)
- The ground truth allows any functions where f = g with f(0)=0, not just linear ones
- For example, f(x) = g(x) = x^2 with f(0)=0 would satisfy the ground truth but not the proposed answer

The proposed answer is too restrictive, missing many valid solutions where f = g are non-linear functions.
