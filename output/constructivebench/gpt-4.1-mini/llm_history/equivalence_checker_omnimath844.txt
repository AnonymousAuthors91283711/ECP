Ground Truth Answer: 2004002
Proposed Answer: 1001 * 1002
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves evaluating a finite sum of alternating terms with quadratic coefficients.

2. The ground truth answer is 2,004,002.

3. The proposed answer is 1001 * 1002 = 1001 * (1000 + 2) = 1,001,000 + 2,002 = 1,003,002.

4. Comparing the two:
   - Ground truth: 2,004,002
   - Proposed: 1,003,002
   These are clearly different numbers.

5. The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the ground truth.

<<<False>>>
