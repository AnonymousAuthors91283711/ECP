Ground Truth Answer: -4
Proposed Answer: -2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation to solve is √(x² + 2x - 6) = √(x² - 14)
2. For the square roots to be real and equal, both radicands must be equal and non-negative:
   x² + 2x - 6 = x² - 14
   and
   x² + 2x - 6 ≥ 0
   x² - 14 ≥ 0

3. Solving the equality:
   x² + 2x - 6 = x² - 14
   2x - 6 = -14
   2x = -8
   x = -4

4. Now check the proposed answer x = -2:
   Plugging in x = -2:
   Left side: √(4 - 4 - 6) = √(-6) → not real
   Right side: √(4 - 14) = √(-10) → not real
   While both sides are undefined, they're not equal in any meaningful sense.

5. The ground truth answer x = -4 satisfies all conditions:
   Both radicands:
   (-4)² + 2*(-4) - 6 = 16 - 8 - 6 = 2 ≥ 0
   (-4)² - 14 = 16 - 14 = 2 ≥ 0
   And the equation holds.

The proposed answer x = -2 doesn't satisfy the original equation in any valid way, while x = -4 is the correct solution.
