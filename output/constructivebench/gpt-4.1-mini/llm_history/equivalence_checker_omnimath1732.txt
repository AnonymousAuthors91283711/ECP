Ground Truth Answer: {(-20, 28, 38), (-20, 38, 28), (28, -20, 38), (28, 38, -20), (38, -20, 28), (38, 28, -20)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b, c) : ℤ × ℤ × ℤ | 
  (a = -20 ∧ b = 28 ∧ c = 38) ∨ 
  (a = -20 ∧ b = 38 ∧ c = 28) ∨ 
  (a = 28 ∧ b = -20 ∧ c = 38) ∨ 
  (a = 28 ∧ b = 38 ∧ c = -20) ∨ 
  (a = 38 ∧ b = -20 ∧ c = 28) ∨ 
  (a = 38 ∧ b = 28 ∧ c = -20)
