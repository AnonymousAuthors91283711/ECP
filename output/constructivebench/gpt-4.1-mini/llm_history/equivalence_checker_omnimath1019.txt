abbrev omnimath1019_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath1019 :
  (∑ a in range 8, ∑ b in range 8, ((a + 1) * (b + 1) % 8 : ℚ)) / 64 = omnimath1019_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 11/4
Proposed Answer: (7 : ℚ)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating a double sum of (a+1)*(b+1) mod 8 for a,b from 0 to 7, divided by 64.

2. The ground truth answer is 11/4 (which equals 2.75 as a decimal).

3. The proposed answer is 7 (which equals 7.0 as a decimal).

4. Let's think about the calculation:
   - The double sum has 64 terms (8×8)
   - Each term is ((a+1)*(b+1)) mod 8
   - The average value should be the sum divided by 64
   - 2.75 (11/4) is a reasonable average for these mod 8 products
   - 7 is much too large to be the average of numbers mod 8

5. The proposed answer of 7 is clearly incorrect compared to the ground truth of 11/4.

<<<False>>>
