Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n * (n + 1) / 2
Proposed Answer: fun n => n * n
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum size of a set C containing a unique subset T of size n where all pairs in T are in "general position" (no two share either coordinate).

2. The ground truth answer is the triangular number formula n(n+1)/2, which makes sense combinatorially:
   - This represents the maximum number of points you can place on a grid while guaranteeing a unique subset of n points with distinct x and y coordinates
   - The triangular number comes from arranging points along the "anti-diagonal"

3. The proposed answer is n², which would be the total number of points in an n×n grid:
   - This is too large because many such grids would contain multiple subsets satisfying the condition
   - For example, with n=2, n²=4 allows multiple pairs in general position, while the correct answer is 3 (which is 2*3/2)

The proposed answer is incorrect as it overcounts the maximum possible size.
