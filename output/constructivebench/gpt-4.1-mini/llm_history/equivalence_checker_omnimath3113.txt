Ground Truth Answer: -10
Proposed Answer: -5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have three equations:
   - a + 5 = b (hab)
   - 5 + b = c (hbc)
   - b + c = a (hac)

2. From hab: a = b - 5
3. From hbc: c = b + 5
4. Substitute a and c into hac:
   b + (b + 5) = (b - 5)
   => 2b + 5 = b - 5
   => b = -10

The ground truth answer (-10) correctly solves the system of equations, while the proposed answer (-5) does not satisfy all equations when substituted back.

<<<False>>>
