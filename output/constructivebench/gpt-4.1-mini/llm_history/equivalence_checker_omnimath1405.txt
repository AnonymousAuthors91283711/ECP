Ground Truth Answer: 512
Proposed Answer: 2*3*25 + 2*5*49 + 2*7*121 + 2*13*289 + 2*17*361 + 2*19*529
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the sum of all numbers ≤100 that satisfy the `isLoose` condition, which requires:
   - Exactly 6 divisors
   - For any two divisors a < b, b ≥ 2a

2. The ground truth answer is 512.

3. The proposed answer is a sum of products of prime numbers in a specific pattern. Let's evaluate it:
   2*3*25 = 150
   2*5*49 = 490
   2*7*121 = 1694
   2*13*289 = 7514
   2*17*361 = 12274
   2*19*529 = 20102
   Sum = 150 + 490 + 1694 + 7514 + 12274 + 20102 = 42224

This is clearly much larger than 512 and doesn't match the ground truth. The proposed answer appears to be calculating something completely different from the sum of numbers ≤100 with the given properties.
