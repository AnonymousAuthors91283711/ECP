Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: (95 : ℝ) ^ 2
Let's analyze this problem carefully:

1. The problem is about finding the least value of the double sum ∑∑ s_i * s_j where each s_i is either 1 or -1.

2. The double sum can be rewritten as (∑ s_i)² because:
   ∑∑ s_i * s_j = (∑ s_i)(∑ s_j) = (∑ s_i)²

3. The minimum value occurs when the sum ∑ s_i is minimized. For 95 variables with values ±1, the minimal sum occurs when we have as many -1s as possible balanced with +1s.

4. For odd n=95, the minimal sum is ±1 (depending on whether there's one more +1 or -1).

5. Therefore, the minimal value of (∑ s_i)² is 1² = 1.

The ground truth answer of 13 is incorrect, and the proposed answer of 95² is also incorrect. However, the proposed answer is much further from the correct answer than the ground truth answer.
