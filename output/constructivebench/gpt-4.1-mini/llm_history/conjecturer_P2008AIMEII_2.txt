The primary Lean errors stem from:
1. Using a `let` binding on the same line multiple times without separating by `;` or newlines.
2. Defining `P2008AIMEII_2_answer` as a computable constant involving real division that Lean can't execute. We should mark it as `noncomputable`.
3. Using real division `/` on `ℝ` needs `noncomputable` or must be accompanied by proofs.

Based on the problem, the time expressions are:
- Runner time: \( r = \frac{50}{v} + 5 \times (50-1) \)
- Jogger time: \( j = \frac{50}{0.75v} + 5 \times \left(\frac{50}{2} -1\right) \)
The condition \(r = j\) yields \(v = \frac{50}{7}\).

So the answer expression is \( \frac{50}{7} \) as a real number.

Fixes:
- Mark `P2008AIMEII_2_answer` as `noncomputable` to avoid compilation error.
- Separate the `let` bindings with newlines or `;`.
- Use `by` tactic for the existence proof, leaving the proof body as `sorry`.

The problem is about finding a speed v such that time taken by Ryan equals time taken by Julie, where

r_time = 50/v + 5*(50 - 1)
j_time = 50/(0.75*v) + 5*(50/2 - 1)

We want r_time = j_time, and solve for v.

Rewrite equations:
50/v + 5*49 = 50/(0.75*v) + 5*24.5

Note 5*49 = 245, 5*24.5 = 122.5.

So:
50/v + 245 = (50/(0.75*v)) + 122.5

Bring terms together,
50/v - 50/(0.75*v) = 122.5 - 245 = -122.5

Factor v out:
50/v - (50 / (3v/4)) = 50/v - 50 * 4/(3v) = (50/v) * (1 - 4/3) = (50/v)*(-1/3) = -50/(3v)

So,
-50/(3v) = -122.5 ⇒ 50/(3v) = 122.5 ⇒ 50 = 122.5 * 3v

So,
v = 50 / (122.5 * 3) = 50 / 367.5 = 2/14.7 ≈ 0.13605...

Exactly 2/14.7 = 20/147.

Thus, the answer is v = 20/147.

In Lean, define P2008AIMEII_2_answer := 20/147.

Also fix syntax of let in theorem; separate statements into lines or use commas.

The error arises because division in Lean's `Real` type is noncomputable in general, so marking the definition `noncomputable` resolves the issue. Also, in Lean, `let` statements in `theorem` statements should be separated by semicolons or newlines for syntax correctness, not just whitespace. 

From the problem statement, the times satisfy:
r_time = 50/v + 5*(50 - 1)
j_time = 50/(0.75*v) + 5*((50/2) - 1)

Setting r_time = j_time and solving for v yields v = 20/147. This matches the enumerated answer.

Hence, the corrected definition and syntax fixes lead to the final solution:
