Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: -2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves complex exponentials raised to the 6th power.
2. Using Euler's formula: exp(Iθ) = cosθ + I*sinθ
3. For θ = 2π/3:
   - (exp(I*2π/3))^6 = exp(I*4π) = cos(4π) + I*sin(4π) = 1 + 0 = 1
4. For θ = 4π/3:
   - (exp(I*4π/3))^6 = exp(I*8π) = cos(8π) + I*sin(8π) = 1 + 0 = 1
5. Therefore, the sum should be 1 + 1 = 2

The ground truth answer is correct (2), while the proposed answer is -2, which is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
