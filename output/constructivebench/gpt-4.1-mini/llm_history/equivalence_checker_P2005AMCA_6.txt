Ground Truth Answer: 5
Proposed Answer: (78 : ℝ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is setting up a scenario with two people (Josh and Mike) traveling at different speeds related to some time t. The key equations are:
   - josh_speed = (4/5)*(13/t)
   - mike_speed = 13/t
   - The distance equation: josh_speed*(2t) + mike_speed*t = 13
   - The final answer is mike_speed * t

2. Simplifying the distance equation:
   (4/5)*(13/t)*(2t) + (13/t)*t = 13
   (4/5)*13*2 + 13 = 13
   (104/5) + 13 = 13
   This shows the equation is consistent.

3. The ground truth answer is 5, which comes from:
   mike_speed * t = (13/t)*t = 13

   Wait, this contradicts the ground truth answer of 5. There seems to be a misunderstanding here. The ground truth answer should actually be 13, since mike_speed * t = 13.

4. The proposed answer is 78, which doesn't match either the stated ground truth (5) or the correct answer (13).

Conclusion: The proposed answer (78) is incorrect, and the ground truth answer (5) is also incorrect based on the problem setup. The correct answer should be 13.
