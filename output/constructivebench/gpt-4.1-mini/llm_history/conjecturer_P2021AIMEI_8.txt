Explanation: The quartic in x can be viewed as a quadratic in y = x²: y² - 2cy + (c+1) = 0. For 12 distinct real roots x, the quadratic has two positive roots y1 ≠ y2 each yielding 2 positive and 2 negative x's (because ±√y), total 4 roots per y, so total 8 if both roots positive and distinct. The problem's enumerated answer and reasoning points to 4 values of c for which the quartic has exactly 12 real roots counting multiplicities, so the answer is 4.
