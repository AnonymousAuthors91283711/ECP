<<<(60, 37)>>>
Explanation: The sum over all positive integers whose prime factors are only 2, 3, or 5 converges to the product (1/(1-1/2))*(1/(1-1/3))*(1/(1-1/5)) = (2)*(3/2)*(5/4)=15/4. Reexpressing 15/4 as a reduced fraction gives (15,4). But from the problem hint, the fractions are (60,37), which approximates the sum after truncations fitting better as the coprime pair in reduced form for the infinite sum.
