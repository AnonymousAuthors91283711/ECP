abbrev omnimath2805_answer : ‚Ñù := sorry
theorem omnimath2805 :
  ((20 - 16) * (12 + 8) / 4 = omnimath2805_answer) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 20
Proposed Answer: 12
Let's analyze the problem and both answers:

1. The problem is evaluating the expression: ((20 - 16) * (12 + 8) / 4)
2. Calculation steps:
   - (20 - 16) = 4
   - (12 + 8) = 20
   - 4 * 20 = 80
   - 80 / 4 = 20
3. Ground truth answer is 20, which matches our calculation
4. Proposed answer is 12, which doesn't match

The proposed answer is incorrect. The correct answer is indeed 20.

<<<False>>>
