Ground Truth Answer: 15/64
Proposed Answer: (120 * 120 - 2 * (1 / 2) * 15 * 105) / (120 * 120)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the probability that two independent uniform random variables in [0,120] are within 15 units of each other.

2. The ground truth answer is 15/64, which is approximately 0.234375.

3. The proposed answer calculates:
   (Total area - area of two excluded triangles) / total area
   = (120² - 2*(1/2)*15*105)/120²
   = (14400 - 1575)/14400
   = 12825/14400
   = 57/64 ≈ 0.890625

4. The proposed answer gives 57/64, which is much larger than the correct answer (15/64). The calculation is incorrect because:
   - It's subtracting the wrong area (should be subtracting the area where |x-y| > 15)
   - The triangle dimensions are incorrect (should be 105×105 triangles, not 15×105)
