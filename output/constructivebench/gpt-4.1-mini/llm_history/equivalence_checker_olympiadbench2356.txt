Ground Truth Answer: (16, 3, 1, 1)
Proposed Answer: (13, 17, 2, 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a system of 7 equations with 4 variables (w, d, a, b) that must satisfy all equations simultaneously.
2. The ground truth answer is (16, 3, 1, 1).
3. The proposed answer is (13, 17, 2, 1).

Let's test the proposed answer against the first equation:
201 = w*6 + d*4 + a*30 + b*63
= 13*6 + 17*4 + 2*30 + 1*63
= 78 + 68 + 60 + 63 = 269 ≠ 201

This already fails the first equation. The ground truth answer (16,3,1,1) gives:
= 16*6 + 3*4 + 1*30 + 1*63
= 96 + 12 + 30 + 63 = 201 ✓

Since the proposed answer fails to satisfy even the first equation, it's clearly incorrect.

<<<False>>>
