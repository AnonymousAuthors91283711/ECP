abbrev omnimath3247_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3247
(k : ℕ)
(hk : k % 7 = 3)
: (3 * k) % 7 = omnimath3247_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem states that k % 7 = 3, meaning k ≡ 3 mod 7
2. We need to find (3 * k) % 7
3. Substituting: 3 * k ≡ 3 * 3 ≡ 9 mod 7
4. Since 9 mod 7 = 2 (because 7 goes into 9 once with remainder 2)

The ground truth answer is indeed 2, while the proposed answer is 3. These are clearly different values.
