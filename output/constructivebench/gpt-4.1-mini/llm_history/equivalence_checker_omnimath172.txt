Ground Truth Answer: {((k : ℤ), (k + 1 : ℤ), (k + 2 : ℤ)) | k ∈ ℤ} ∪ {((k : ℤ), (k + 2 : ℤ), (k + 1 : ℤ)) | k ∈ ℤ} ∪ {((k + 2 : ℤ), (k : ℤ), (k + 1 : ℤ)) | k ∈ ℤ} ∪ {((k + 1 : ℤ), (k + 2 : ℤ), (k : ℤ)) | k ∈ ℤ} ∪ {((k + 1 : ℤ), (k : ℤ), (k + 2 : ℤ)) | k ∈ ℤ} ∪ {((k + 2 : ℤ), (k + 1 : ℤ), (k : ℤ)) | k ∈ ℤ}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b, c) : ℤ × ℤ × ℤ | ∃ n : ℕ, (a - b) * (b - c) * (c - a) = 2 * (2016 ^ n - 2)}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is close to the ground truth but not exactly equivalent. The ground truth answer explicitly lists all permutations of consecutive integers (k, k+1, k+2), which would make (a-b)(b-c)(c-a) equal to ±2, leading to N=1 when substituted into hN. However, the proposed answer allows for more general cases where (a-b)(b-c)(c-a) equals 2*(2016^n - 2), which would satisfy N=2016^n. While the ground truth solution is a subset of the proposed answer (when n=0), the proposed answer is more general and includes other cases not covered by the ground truth. Therefore, they are not fully equivalent.
