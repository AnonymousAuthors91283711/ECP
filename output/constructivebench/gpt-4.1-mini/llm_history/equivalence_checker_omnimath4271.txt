Ground Truth Answer: (4, 2)
Proposed Answer: (3, 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for natural numbers (m,n) where 0 < m and 0 < n that satisfy the equation:
   (1/n²) - (3/(2n³)) = (1/m²)

2. The ground truth answer is (4,2). Let's verify this:
   (1/2²) - (3/(2*2³)) = (1/4) - (3/16) = (4/16 - 3/16) = 1/16
   And 1/4² = 1/16, so it satisfies the equation.

3. The proposed answer is (3,2):
   (1/2²) - (3/(2*2³)) = 1/16 (same as above)
   But 1/3² = 1/9 ≠ 1/16, so it doesn't satisfy the equation.

The proposed answer (3,2) doesn't satisfy the given equation, while the ground truth (4,2) does. They are not equivalent.
