<<<(122 : ℝ)^(1 / 5)>>>
Explanation: The equation x * ⌊x * ⌊x * ⌊x * ⌊x⌋⌋⌋⌋ = 122 suggests a nested expression with five factors of x multiplied by integer floors. If x is just above 2, then ⌊x⌋ = 2, and the nested floor expressions reduce to powers of 2, so the overall product is approximately x^5 * 2^4, but floors reduce powers. By examining the equation, the unique x satisfying the equation is the fifth root of 122.
