Ground Truth Answer: fun n => {k | n ≤ k ∧ k ≤ (3 * n + 1) / 2}
Proposed Answer: fun n => {k | 1 ≤ k ∧ k ≤ 2 * n}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about determining for which values of k (between 1 and 2n) a certain property holds for all coin sequences of length 2n.

2. The ground truth answer restricts k to be between n and approximately 1.5n (specifically (3n+1)/2).

3. The proposed answer allows k to be any value between 1 and 2n, which is much broader than the ground truth.

The proposed answer includes all values that the ground truth answer includes (since n ≤ (3n+1)/2 ≤ 2n for n > 0), but also includes many additional values (k < n) that shouldn't be included according to the ground truth.
