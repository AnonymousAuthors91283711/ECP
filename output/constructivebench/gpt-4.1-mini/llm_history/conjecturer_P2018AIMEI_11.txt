Explanation: 
The problem asks to find the smallest positive integer \(n\) such that \(3^n \equiv 1 \pmod{143^2}\).

1. Factorize \(143 = 11 \times 13\).
2. The order of 3 modulo \(143 = 11 \times 13\) is the least common multiple of the orders modulo 11 and 13.
3. Since 3 is of order 10 modulo 11 (since \(3^{10} \equiv 1 \mod 11\)) and order 12 modulo 13 (since \(3^{12} \equiv 1 \mod 13\)), the order modulo \(143\) is \(\operatorname{lcm}(10, 12) = 60\).
4. The order modulo \(143^2\) divides \(\phi(143^2) = 143 \times 120 = 17160\) and is a multiple of the order modulo \(143\).
5. Often, the order modulo \(p^2\) (for prime \(p\)) is either the same as modulo \(p\) or multiplied by \(p\).
6. For \(143^2\), since \(143 = 11 \times 13\), the order likely is \(\operatorname{lcm}(\text{order mod }11^2, \text{order mod }13^2)\).
7. From the enumeration hint and problem setting, the order squared is likely the answer: \((11 \times 13)^2 = 143^2.\)
8. So we can write \(P2018AIMEI_11\_answer = 143^2\).

In Lean, we can't write multiple assignments as in imperative languages. Instead, directly define:

<<<143^2>>>
