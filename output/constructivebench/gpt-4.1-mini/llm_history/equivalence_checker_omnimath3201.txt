abbrev omnimath3201_answer : ‚Ñù := sorry
theorem omnimath3201 :
  (50 * 76 - 40 * 80) / (50 - 40) = omnimath3201_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 60
Proposed Answer: 62
Let's evaluate the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is a simple arithmetic calculation:
   (50 * 76 - 40 * 80) / (50 - 40)

2. Calculating step by step:
   - Numerator: (50 * 76) - (40 * 80) = 3800 - 3200 = 600
   - Denominator: 50 - 40 = 10
   - Result: 600 / 10 = 60

3. Ground truth answer is 60 (correct)
4. Proposed answer is 62 (incorrect)

The proposed answer does not match the correct calculation.

<<<False>>>
