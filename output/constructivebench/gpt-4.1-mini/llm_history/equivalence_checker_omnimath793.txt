Ground Truth Answer: 1233
Proposed Answer: (2002^2 - 1) / 2001 - 1
Let me analyze this problem carefully.

The problem involves calculating phi_k(n, k), which counts numbers up to n/k that are coprime with n. The ground truth answer is 1233, while the proposed answer suggests (2002² - 1)/2001 - 1.

First, let's compute the proposed answer:
(2002² - 1)/2001 - 1 = (2002 - 1)(2002 + 1)/2001 - 1 = 2001*2003/2001 - 1 = 2003 - 1 = 2002

This clearly doesn't match the ground truth answer of 1233. The proposed answer is simply doing algebraic manipulation without considering the coprimality condition that's central to the phi_k function.

The correct approach would involve:
1. Factorizing 2002² - 1 = (2002-1)(2002+1) = 2001 * 2003
2. Further factorizing these numbers
3. Then counting numbers up to (2002²-1)/2001 = 2003 that are coprime with 2001*2003

The proposed answer completely misses this complexity and gives a much larger, incorrect number.
