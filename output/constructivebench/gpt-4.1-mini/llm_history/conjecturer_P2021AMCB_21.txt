Explanation: The equation \(x^2 = 2^x\) for \(x > 0\) has solutions at \(x=2\) and \(x=4\). Their sum is \(6\). Since the problem sets \(P2021AMCB_21\_answer\) as the set containing this sum, the answer is the singleton set \(\{6\}\). However, since \(P2021AMCB_21_answer\) is meant to be a set of real numbers equal to the sum of the solutions, and solutions themselves are explicitly \(\{2,4\}\), likely it wants the solution set, so enclosed in set bracket with members \(2\) and \(4\). But the problem defines \(solution_set := \{x > 0 | x^2 = 2^x\}\)—which is \(\{2,4\}\). Therefore, the answer is \(\{2,4\}\). Hence final answer: \(\{2,4\}\).
