Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2 * n + 1) * (n + 1)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 2 * n * (n + 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of True entries (represented as 1s) in a (2n+1)×(2n+1) Boolean matrix Q under the constraint that for any 2×2 submatrix, the sum of its entries is ≤ 2.

2. The ground truth answer is (2n+1)(n+1), which makes sense because:
   - For a matrix of odd size (2n+1), the optimal pattern is checkerboard-like with alternating rows having n and n+1 True entries
   - This gives (n+1) rows with (n+1) True entries and n rows with n True entries
   - Total: (n+1)² + n² = 2n² + 2n + 1 = (2n+1)(n+1)

3. The proposed answer is 2n(n+1), which would be correct for a 2n×2n matrix (giving 2n²), but is incorrect for the (2n+1)×(2n+1) case.

The answers are not equivalent, as the proposed answer is missing the additional n+1 term that comes from the odd-sized matrix.
