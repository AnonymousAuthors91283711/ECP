Ground Truth Answer: (3 - sqrt 3) / 6
Proposed Answer: ((1/2 - ((1/12)^(1/2))))
Let's analyze the proposed answer and compare it to the ground truth answer.

1. First, let's simplify the ground truth answer: (3 - √3)/6 = 1/2 - √3/6 ≈ 1/2 - 0.2887 ≈ 0.2113

2. Now let's evaluate the proposed answer: (1/2 - (1/12)^(1/2)) = 1/2 - √(1/12) = 1/2 - (√3)/6 ≈ 0.2113

3. We can see that √(1/12) = (√3)/6 because:
   √(1/12) = 1/√12 = √3/√36 = √3/6

Therefore, the proposed answer is exactly equal to the ground truth answer, just written in a different but equivalent form.

<<<True>>>
