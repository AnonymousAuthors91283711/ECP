Ground Truth Answer: {(30, 92), (92, 30)}
Proposed Answer: {p : ℕ × ℕ | p.1 > 0 ∧ p.2 > 0 ∧ p.1 ^ 2 + p.2 ^ 2 = 9364}
<<<True>>>

The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both are describing the same set of natural number pairs (n, m) where both n and m are positive, and satisfy the equation n² + m² = 9364. The ground truth explicitly lists the solutions {(30, 92), (92, 30)}, while the proposed answer describes the set through its defining properties. Since (30, 92) and (92, 30) are indeed the only positive integer solutions to this equation, the two answers are equivalent. The proposed answer's formulation is just a more general description of the same set.
