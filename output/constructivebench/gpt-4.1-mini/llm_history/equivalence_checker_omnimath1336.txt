Ground Truth Answer: 1 / 1624
Proposed Answer: 1/((1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/6) * (1 - 1/30))
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves a triple infinite sum over a, b, c where 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ c, with terms of the form 1/(2^a * 3^b * 5^c).

2. The ground truth answer is given as 1/1624.

3. The proposed answer is 1/((1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/6) * (1 - 1/30)).

Let's evaluate the proposed answer:
- (1 - 1/2) = 1/2
- (1 - 1/6) = 5/6
- (1 - 1/30) = 29/30
- The denominator becomes (1/2)*(5/6)*(29/30) = (5/12)*(29/30) = 145/360 = 29/72
- Therefore, the proposed answer is 1/(29/72) = 72/29 ≈ 2.4827

This is clearly different from the ground truth answer of 1/1624 ≈ 0.0006157. The proposed answer is incorrect.
