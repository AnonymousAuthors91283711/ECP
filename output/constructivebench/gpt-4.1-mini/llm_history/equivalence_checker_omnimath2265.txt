  ∃! (AB : ℕ × ℕ), AB.1 ≤ 9 ∧ AB.2 ≤ 9 ∧ (1001 * AB.1 + 110 * AB.2)^2 = 57108249 ∧ 10 * AB.1 + AB.2 = omnimath2265_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 75
Proposed Answer: 81
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a unique pair (A,B) where A and B are digits (≤9) such that:
   - (1001*A + 110*B)² = 57108249
   - 10*A + B forms a two-digit number (the answer)

2. The ground truth answer is 75, meaning A=7, B=5.

3. The proposed answer is 81, meaning A=8, B=1.

Let's check if (8,1) satisfies the conditions:
- (1001*8 + 110*1)² = (8008 + 110)² = 8118² = 65881924 ≠ 57108249

The calculation shows the proposed answer doesn't satisfy the main equation, while the ground truth answer (75) does:
- (1001*7 + 110*5)² = (7007 + 550)² = 7557² = 57108249

<<<False>>>
