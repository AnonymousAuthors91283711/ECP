Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 3 * n^2 - 5 * n + 2
Proposed Answer: fun n => 4 * (n - 2) * (n - 1)
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: 3n² - 5n + 2
2. Proposed: 4(n-2)(n-1) = 4(n² - 3n + 2) = 4n² - 12n + 8

Let's compare them for n=3:
- Ground Truth: 3*9 - 5*3 + 2 = 27 - 15 + 2 = 14
- Proposed: 4*1*2 = 8

The values don't match, so the answers are different. The proposed answer is incorrect.
