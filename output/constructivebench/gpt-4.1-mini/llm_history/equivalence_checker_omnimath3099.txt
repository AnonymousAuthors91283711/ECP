Ground Truth Answer: 13/27
Proposed Answer: (17 / 36 : ℚ)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating a probability related to dice faces. There are faces numbered 2 through 7 (total 6 faces).

2. Total dots = 2+3+4+5+6+7 = 27

3. The probability calculation involves:
   - For each odd face (3,5,7), two terms are calculated:
     * (n-1)/totalDots
     * 1/(6*totalDots)
   - These are summed for all odd faces

4. Calculating for each odd face:
   - For 3: (2/27 + 1/162) = 13/162
   - For 5: (4/27 + 1/162) = 25/162
   - For 7: (6/27 + 1/162) = 37/162
   - Total probability = (13+25+37)/162 = 75/162 = 25/54 ≈ 0.46296

5. Ground truth answer is 13/27 ≈ 0.48148
6. Proposed answer is 17/36 ≈ 0.47222

The calculations show none of these match the correct probability (25/54). Both answers are incorrect, but they're different incorrect answers.
