theorem omnimath398 :
  (∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2001, n ^ 3 = omnimath398_answer) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 4012013006001
Proposed Answer: (2001 * 2002 / 2) ^ 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the sum of cubes from 1³ to 2001³ (∑ n³ for n=1 to 2001).

2. The ground truth answer is 4012013006001.

3. The proposed answer is (2001 * 2002 / 2)².

Let's evaluate the proposed answer:
- The expression (n(n+1)/2)² is a known formula for the sum of cubes from 1³ to n³.
- For n=2001:
  (2001*2002/2)² = (2001*1001)²
  Calculating this:
  2001*1001 = 2003001
  2003001² = 4012013006001

This exactly matches the ground truth answer.

<<<True>>>
