theorem omnimath2783 : 
  ∃! (n : ℕ), n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) = 27 ∧ n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) = omnimath2783_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 720
Proposed Answer: 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a unique natural number n that satisfies two conditions:
   - n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 27
   - n * (n+1) * (n+2) = some value (omnimath2783_answer)

2. The ground truth answer gives the product (720) as the final answer.

3. The proposed answer gives n=3 as the solution.

First, let's verify if n=3 satisfies the first condition:
3 + 4 + 5 = 12 ≠ 27, so n=3 is not even a solution to the first equation.

The correct solution would be:
n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 27 ⇒ 3n + 3 = 27 ⇒ n = 8
Then the product would be 8 * 9 * 10 = 720.

The proposed answer (n=3) is completely wrong as it doesn't satisfy either condition, while the ground truth correctly gives the product for the actual solution (n=8).
