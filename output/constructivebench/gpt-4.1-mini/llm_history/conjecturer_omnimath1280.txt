The problem asks for the cardinality of the set of integers k between 1 and 2000 inclusive for which gcd(k, 2001) = 1. This is basically Euler's tot function φ(2001).

We factor 2001:

2001 = 3 * 23 * 29 (all primes)

Then

φ(2001) = 2001 * (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/23) * (1 - 1/29)
= 2001 * (2/3) * (22/23) * (28/29)

Calculate:

2001 * 2/3 = 1334
1334 * 22/23 = (1334 * 22) / 23 = (29348) / 23 = 1276 (since 23 * 1276 = 29348)
1276 * 28/29 = (1276 * 28)/29 = (35728)/29 = 1232 (since 29*1232 = 35728)

So final answer is 1232.

Thus,

<<< 1232 >>>
