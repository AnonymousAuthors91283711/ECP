Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1006), (3, 331), (11, 31)}
Proposed Answer: { x : ℤ × ℤ | x.1 > 0 ∧ x.2 > 0 ∧ (2 * x.1) ∣ (2013 - x.1 ^ 3) ∧ x.2 = (2013 - x.1 ^ 3) / (2 * x.1) }

The proposed answer is a set comprehension that describes all pairs (a, b) where a > 0, b > 0, and b is determined by the equation (2013 - a³)/(2a). This is mathematically equivalent to the original condition a³ + 2ab = 2013, just rearranged. However, the ground truth answer explicitly lists the three specific solutions that satisfy these conditions, while the proposed answer gives a general characterization of all possible solutions. 

They are equivalent in terms of describing the same set of solutions, but one is in explicit form while the other is in implicit form. The proposed answer doesn't explicitly compute the solutions like the ground truth does, but it correctly characterizes them. Therefore, the answers are "Close" - the proposed answer is correct in its characterization but doesn't provide the explicit enumeration.
