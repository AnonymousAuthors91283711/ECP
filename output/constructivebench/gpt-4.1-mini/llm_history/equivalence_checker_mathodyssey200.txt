Ground Truth Answer: {fun x => x ^ 3 + 5 * x + 1, fun x => (x - 8) ^ 2 + 2}
Proposed Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ M, ∃ N, ∀ x ≥ N, f x ≥ M}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer describes the set of all functions that tend to infinity as x tends to infinity (using the epsilon-delta style definition), which is indeed equivalent to the condition `Tendsto f atTop atTop` mentioned in the problem statement. However, the ground truth answer provides two specific examples of such functions rather than the general characterization. While both answers are correct in their own context, they are not equivalent in form - one is a general set description while the other is a specific enumeration. Therefore, the answer is Close since the proposed answer is mathematically correct for the problem but not equivalent to the given ground truth answer.
