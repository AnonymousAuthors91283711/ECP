Ground Truth Answer: 962
Proposed Answer: 2^(5 + 5) - 2^5 - 2^5 + 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting the number of valid arrangements on a 5×5 grid where for every point in the set, either its entire row or its entire column must be in the set.

2. The ground truth answer is 962.

3. The proposed answer is 2^(5+5) - 2^5 - 2^5 + 1 = 1024 - 32 - 32 + 1 = 961.

The proposed answer is very close to the ground truth (off by 1), and follows a reasonable approach:
- 2^(5+5) counts all possible subsets of the grid
- Subtract 2^5 for subsets missing a full row (for each of 5 rows)
- Subtract 2^5 for subsets missing a full column (for each of 5 columns)
- Add 1 because the empty set was subtracted twice

However, the exact count should be 962, so the proposed formula is slightly incorrect. The difference likely comes from some edge case not being accounted for properly in the inclusion-exclusion calculation.
