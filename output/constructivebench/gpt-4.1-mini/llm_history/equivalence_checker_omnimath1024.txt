Ground Truth Answer: 172
Proposed Answer: ∑ n ∈ (Finset.range 200).filter (λ n => 0 < n ∧ Nat.totient n + 4 * (n.divisors).card = n), n
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both expressions are calculating the sum of numbers n in the range 1 to 199 (Finset.range 200) that satisfy the condition 0 < n ∧ φ n + 4 * (Nat.divisors n).card = n. The only differences are:
1. The proposed answer uses λ instead of fun for the anonymous function, which is just syntactic sugar in Lean
2. The proposed answer writes Nat.totient n instead of φ n, but these are the same function (φ is just a notation for Nat.totient)
3. The proposed answer writes n.divisors instead of Nat.divisors n, which are equivalent
The mathematical content and computation are identical, so the answers are equivalent.
