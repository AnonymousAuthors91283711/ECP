Ground Truth Answer: {2400, 1350, 864}
Proposed Answer: {90 * x | x ∈ ({1/2, 2/3, 1} : Set ℝ)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for all possible areas (A) of right triangles where:
   - The sides a < b < c form an arithmetic progression
   - One of the sides (a, b, or c) equals 60
   - The area is calculated as A = (a*b)/2

2. Ground truth gives exact values: {2400, 1350, 864}
3. Proposed answer gives a parametric form: {90 * x | x ∈ ({1/2, 2/3, 1} : Set ℝ)}

Let's evaluate the proposed answer:
- 90 * (1/2) = 45 (not in ground truth)
- 90 * (2/3) ≈ 60 (not in ground truth)
- 90 * 1 = 90 (not in ground truth)

None of these values match the ground truth. The proposed answer seems completely incorrect.

<<<False>>>
