Ground Truth Answer: {fun x : ℝ => x, fun x : ℝ => -x}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℝ, (c = 0 ∨ c = 1) ∧ f = fun x => c * x}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is close but not exactly equivalent to the ground truth. The ground truth explicitly lists the two functions `f(x) = x` and `f(x) = -x`, while the proposed answer describes them as `f(x) = c*x` where `c` is 0 or 1. However, the proposed answer misses the case where `c = -1` (which corresponds to `f(x) = -x` in the ground truth). The case `c = 0` would give the zero function, which doesn't satisfy the original equation when tested with non-zero x. So the proposed answer is partially correct but has both an omission (`c = -1`) and an incorrect inclusion (`c = 0`).
