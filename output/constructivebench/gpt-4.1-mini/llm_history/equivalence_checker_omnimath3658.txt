Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all integer triples (a,b,c) that satisfy a² + b² + c² = a²b².

2. Ground truth answer is just {(0,0,0)}.

3. Proposed answer includes:
   - (0,0,0)
   - Cases where one variable is 0 and the other two are ±1
   - Cases where two variables are ±1 and one is 0

Testing the proposed solutions:
- For (0,0,0): 0+0+0 = 0*0*0 → valid
- For (0,1,1): 0+1+1 = 0*1*1 → 2=0 → invalid
- For (1,0,1): 1+0+1 = 1*0*1 → 2=0 → invalid
- For (1,1,0): 1+1+0 = 1*1*0 → 2=0 → invalid

Only (0,0,0) actually satisfies the equation. The other cases in the proposed answer don't satisfy the equation when tested.
