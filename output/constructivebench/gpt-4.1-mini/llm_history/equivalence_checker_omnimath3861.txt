Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ k, ∀ a, f a = k * a ∧ 0 < f a}
Proposed Answer: { f | ∃ c : ℕ, f = fun n => c * n }
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer states:
1. There exists some constant k such that for all a, f(a) = k*a
2. And f(a) > 0 for all a

The proposed answer states:
1. There exists some constant c such that f(n) = c*n

The key differences are:
1. The proposed answer doesn't explicitly state that f(a) > 0 for all a
2. The ground truth uses k while the proposed answer uses c (but this is just variable naming)

The condition f(a) > 0 is important because:
- The original problem statement includes conditions 0 < a and 0 < b
- The divisibility condition (a + f b) ∣ (a² + b * f a) would be affected if f could be zero

Therefore, while the functional forms are identical, the proposed answer is missing the positivity constraint.
