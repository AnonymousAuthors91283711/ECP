(m n : ℤ)
(hmn : m + 1 = (n - 2) / 3)
: 3 * m - n = omnimath3070_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: -5
Proposed Answer: -7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us the equation: m + 1 = (n - 2)/3
2. We need to find the value of 3m - n
3. Let's solve the given equation for n:
   - Multiply both sides by 3: 3(m + 1) = n - 2
   - Simplify: 3m + 3 = n - 2
   - Solve for n: n = 3m + 5
4. Now substitute n into 3m - n:
   - 3m - n = 3m - (3m + 5) = -5

The ground truth answer (-5) matches our calculation, while the proposed answer (-7) does not.
