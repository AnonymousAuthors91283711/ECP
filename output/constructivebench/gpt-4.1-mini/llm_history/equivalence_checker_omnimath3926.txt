theorem omnimath3926 : fn 1991 (2^1990) = omnimath3926_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 256
Proposed Answer: 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves repeatedly applying a function `f1` that squares the sum of digits of a number. We start with 2^1990 and apply this operation 1991 times.

2. The key observation is that repeated digit sum operations and squaring will quickly reduce any large number to a small fixed point. For this type of operation, numbers typically stabilize at 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, or eventually reach 256 (which maps to itself since (2+5+6)^2 = 13^2 = 169 → (1+6+9)^2 = 256).

3. The ground truth answer is 256, which is indeed a fixed point for this operation.

4. The proposed answer is 2, which is incorrect. While 2 is part of the sequence (2 → 4 → 16 → 49 → 169 → 256), it's not the final stable value after 1991 iterations.
