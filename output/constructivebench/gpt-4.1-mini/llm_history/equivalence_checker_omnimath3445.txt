theorem omnimath3445 :
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 100 * 2^n > 10000 * (1/2)^n} omnimath3445_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2004
Proposed Answer: 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n such that 100 * 2^n > 10000 * (1/2)^n.

2. We can simplify the inequality:
   100 * 2^n > 10000 * (1/2)^n
   => 2^n * (1/2)^n > 100
   => (2 * 1/2)^n > 100
   => 1^n > 100
   => 1 > 100

3. This simplification shows that the original inequality reduces to 1 > 100, which is always false for any n.

4. The ground truth answer of 2004 cannot be correct since no natural number satisfies the inequality.

5. The proposed answer of 7 is also incorrect for the same reason.

However, both answers are wrong because the inequality has no solution. The ground truth answer is particularly far off, while the proposed answer is a smaller incorrect number.

<<<False>>>
