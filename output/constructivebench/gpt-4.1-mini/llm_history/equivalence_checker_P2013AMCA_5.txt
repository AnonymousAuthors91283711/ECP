Ground Truth Answer: 20
Proposed Answer: (105 + 125 + 175) / 3 - 105 - ((105 + 125 + 175) / 3 - 125)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer step by step.

1. The problem defines:
   - total = 105 + 125 + 175 = 405
   - share = total / 3 = 135
   - t = share - 105 = 30
   - d = share - 125 = 10
   - t - d = 20 (which matches the ground truth answer)

2. The proposed answer is:
   (105 + 125 + 175)/3 - 105 - ((105 + 125 + 175)/3 - 125)
   = share - 105 - (share - 125)
   = t - d
   = 20

The proposed answer correctly simplifies to t - d, which equals 20, matching the ground truth answer. The expressions are exactly equivalent.
