Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 3
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal 'b' such that there exists a set of numbers (defined by P(n) = n²+n+1) in an interval [a, a+b] where each element is not coprime with the product of the others (IsFragrant property).

2. The ground truth answer is 6, which means the smallest interval length where such a fragrant set exists is 6.

3. The proposed answer is 3, claiming this minimal interval length is 3.

Analysis:
- For b=3, it's unlikely to find such a set since P(n) values grow rapidly and it's hard to satisfy the non-coprime condition in such a small interval.
- The smallest known case is indeed b=6, where we can find numbers like P(1)=3, P(2)=7, P(3)=13, etc., and select a subset where the condition holds.
- The proposed answer of 3 is too small and doesn't match known results for this type of problem.

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect.
