Ground Truth Answer: fun n => choose (n - 1) 2
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n * (n - 1) / 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of ordered pairs (i,j) where i < j and π(i)*π(j) > i*j for some permutation π of {1,...,n}.

2. The ground truth answer is the binomial coefficient C(n-1, 2), which equals (n-1)(n-2)/2.

3. The proposed answer is n(n-1)/2, which is different from (n-1)(n-2)/2.

4. For n=3:
   - Ground truth: C(2,2) = 1
   - Proposed: 3*2/2 = 3
   These are clearly different.

5. For n=4:
   - Ground truth: C(3,2) = 3
   - Proposed: 4*3/2 = 6
   Again different.

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the ground truth for any n ≥ 3. The proposed answer actually gives the total number of pairs (i,j) with i < j, not the maximum number satisfying the given condition.
