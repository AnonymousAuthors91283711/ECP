Ground Truth Answer: {0, (1 - ·), (·) - 1}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℝ, f = (λ x => if x = 0 then 0 else c)}
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is to find all real-valued functions f: ℝ → ℝ that satisfy the functional equation:
f(f(x)*f(y)) + f(x+y) = f(x*y) for all x,y ∈ ℝ.

Ground truth gives three solutions:
1. The zero function f(x) = 0
2. f(x) = 1 - x
3. f(x) = x - 1

The proposed answer suggests all functions that are zero at x=0 and constant elsewhere (with the same constant c for all x≠0).

Let's test if these satisfy the original equation:

1. For f(x) = 0: Clearly satisfies as all terms become 0.
2. For f(x) = c when x≠0, f(0)=0:
   Let x=1, y=1:
   f(f(1)*f(1)) + f(2) = f(1)
   => f(c*c) + c = c
   => f(c²) = 0
   This must hold for all c. But f(c²)=0 only if c²=0 (since f is 0 only at 0), so c must be 0.
   Thus, the only function in this form that works is f(x)=0.

The proposed answer misses the non-constant solutions (1-x and x-1) and incorrectly includes other constant functions besides zero.
