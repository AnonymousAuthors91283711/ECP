Ground Truth Answer: 4 - 2 * Real.sqrt 3
Proposed Answer: 2 * Real.sqrt 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the least value of |x-y| + |y-z| under the given constraints:
   - 0 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ 4
   - x² + 2 = y²
   - y² + 2 = z²

2. From the equations:
   - y = √(x² + 2)
   - z = √(y² + 2) = √(x² + 4)

3. The expression to minimize is:
   |x - y| + |y - z| = (y - x) + (z - y) = z - x (since x ≤ y ≤ z)

4. So we need to minimize √(x² + 4) - x

5. The ground truth answer 4 - 2√3 comes from:
   - The minimum occurs at x = 0, giving z - x = √4 - 0 = 2
   - Or at the point where the derivative is zero (x = 2/√3)
   - The minimal value is indeed 4 - 2√3 ≈ 0.5358

6. The proposed answer 2√2 ≈ 2.828 is:
   - The value when x = 0: √4 - 0 = 2
   - Or when x = √2: √6 - √2 ≈ 1.035
   - But not the minimal value

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't represent the minimal value under the given constraints.
