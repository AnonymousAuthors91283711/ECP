theorem mathodyssey6 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∃ k m : ℕ, 3 * n + 1 = k^2 ∧ 5 * n + 1 = m^2} mathodyssey6_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 16
Proposed Answer: 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n such that:
   - 3n + 1 is a perfect square (k²)
   - 5n + 1 is a perfect square (m²)

2. Ground truth answer is 16. Let's verify:
   - 3*16 + 1 = 49 = 7²
   - 5*16 + 1 = 81 = 9²
   This satisfies both conditions.

3. Proposed answer is 5. Let's verify:
   - 3*5 + 1 = 16 = 4² (valid)
   - 5*5 + 1 = 26 (not a perfect square)
   This fails the second condition.

The proposed answer 5 only satisfies one of the two required conditions, while the ground truth answer 16 satisfies both. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
