abbrev omnimath2137_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2137 : 
  (∑ i in Finset.range 2013, (digits 4 (i+1)).length) = omnimath2137_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 12345
Proposed Answer: 2013 * 4
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem asks for the sum of the number of digits in base-4 representation for all numbers from 1 to 2013. The proposed answer suggests this is simply 2013 * 4, which would be correct if every number from 1 to 2013 had exactly 4 digits in base-4. However, this is not the case:

1. Numbers 1-3: 1 digit in base-4
2. Numbers 4-15: 2 digits in base-4
3. Numbers 16-63: 3 digits in base-4
4. Numbers 64-2013: 4 digits in base-4

The proposed answer overcounts by treating all numbers as having 4 digits, when in fact many have fewer digits. The ground truth answer (12345) is the correct sum, while the proposed answer (2013*4=8052) is significantly larger and incorrect.
