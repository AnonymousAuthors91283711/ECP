Ground Truth Answer: fun T => (5^2 - 20)^2 - T
Proposed Answer: fun T => 5^2 - 20 - T
Let's analyze the problem and both answers carefully.

Problem Analysis:
We need to solve √(20 + √(T + x)) = 5 for x in terms of T. The ground truth answer shows the correct step-by-step solution:
1. Square both sides: 20 + √(T + x) = 25
2. Subtract 20: √(T + x) = 5
3. Square again: T + x = 25
4. Solve for x: x = 25 - T

The ground truth answer is equivalent to this since (5^2 - 20)^2 - T = (25 - 20)^2 - T = 5^2 - T = 25 - T.

The proposed answer is 5^2 - 20 - T = 25 - 20 - T = 5 - T, which is incorrect as it misses the second squaring step.
