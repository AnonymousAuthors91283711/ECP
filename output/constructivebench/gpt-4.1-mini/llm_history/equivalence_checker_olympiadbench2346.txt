    (log x)^(log (log x)) = 10000 ↔ x ∈ olympiadbench2346_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {10^(100 : ℝ), 10^(1/100)}
Proposed Answer: {x : ℝ | x > 0 ∧ log (log x) = 4}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all positive real x where (log x)^(log (log x)) = 10000.

2. The ground truth gives two specific solutions: 10^100 and 10^(1/100).

3. The proposed answer gives a set defined by x > 0 and log(log x) = 4.

Let's verify:
- For x = 10^100: log x = 100, log(log x) = log(100) = 2 ≠ 4
- For x = 10^(1/100): log x = 1/100, log(log x) = log(1/100) = -2 ≠ 4

The proposed answer's condition log(log x) = 4 would only be satisfied when x = 10^(10^4), which is not in the ground truth solution set. The proposed answer is completely different from the ground truth.
