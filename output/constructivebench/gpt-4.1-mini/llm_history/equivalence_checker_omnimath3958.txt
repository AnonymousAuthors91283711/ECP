theorem omnimath3958 (a b c d : ℝ) :
  (a + b) * (a^2 + b^2) = (c + d) * (c^2 + d^2) ∧
  (a + c) * (a^2 + c^2) = (b + d) * (b^2 + d^2) ∧
  (a + d) * (a^2 + d^2) = (b + c) * (b^2 + c^2) ↔ (a, b, c, d) ∈ omnimath3958_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: { (a, b, c, d) | a = b ∧ b = c ∧ c = d }
Proposed Answer: {(a,b,c,d) | a = b ∧ b = c ∧ c = d} ∪ {(a,b,c,d) | a = b ∧ c = d} ∪ {(a,b,c,d) | a = c ∧ b = d} ∪ {(a,b,c,d) | a = d ∧ b = c}
