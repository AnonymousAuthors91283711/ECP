Ground Truth Answer: 30
Proposed Answer: 24
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a linear function f(x) = m*x + b
2. We know f(6) - f(2) = 12
3. We need to find f(12) - f(2)

Calculating step by step:
f(6) - f(2) = (6m + b) - (2m + b) = 4m = 12 ⇒ m = 3

Then f(12) - f(2) = (12m + b) - (2m + b) = 10m = 10*3 = 30

The ground truth answer is correct (30), while the proposed answer is 24, which is incorrect.
