Ground Truth Answer: { (fun _ => 0, fun _ => 0) } ∪ 
  { (fun x => x^2 + c, fun x => x) | c : ℝ }
Proposed Answer: {(f, g) | ∃ a b : ℝ, (f = fun x => a * x + b) ∧ (g = fun x => a * x)}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

The problem is a functional equation: ∀ x y, g (f (x + y)) = f x + (2 * x + y) * g y

Ground Truth Answer gives two cases:
1. The zero functions (f(x)=0, g(x)=0)
2. Quadratic f(x)=x²+c with linear g(x)=x

Proposed Answer suggests only linear solutions:
f(x) = a*x + b and g(x) = a*x

Let's test if the proposed solutions satisfy the original equation:

1. For zero functions: works (matches ground truth)
2. For linear functions:
g(f(x+y)) = a*(a*(x+y)+b) = a²(x+y) + a*b
f(x) + (2x+y)*g(y) = (a*x + b) + (2x+y)*(a*y) = a*x + b + 2a*x*y + a*y²

These are not equal for arbitrary x,y unless a=0 (zero case) or a=1,b=0 (but then f(x)=x, g(x)=x which doesn't satisfy the equation). The quadratic solution from ground truth is missing entirely.
