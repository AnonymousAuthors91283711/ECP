Ground Truth Answer: 10
Proposed Answer: 12
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem involves evaluating the expression (2 * a⁻¹ + (a⁻¹ / 2)) / a where a = 1/2.

2. Let's compute this step by step:
   - a⁻¹ = 1/(1/2) = 2
   - 2 * a⁻¹ = 2 * 2 = 4
   - a⁻¹ / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1
   - Numerator: 4 + 1 = 5
   - Denominator: a = 1/2
   - Final division: 5 / (1/2) = 10

3. The ground truth answer is 10, which matches our calculation.

4. The proposed answer is 12, which does not match our calculation.
