Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2 * n / 3) + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n ^ 3 - (n - 1) ^ 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the maximum number of distinct triples (a,b,c) where a+b+c = n and all a's, b's, and c's are distinct across triples.

2. The ground truth answer suggests a linear growth (2n/3 + 1), which makes sense as we're constrained by the sum n and need distinct components.

3. The proposed answer is n³ - (n-1)³ = 3n² - 3n + 1, which grows quadratically. This is clearly different from the linear growth of the ground truth.

4. For example, when n=3:
   - Ground truth: 2*3/3 + 1 = 3
   - Proposed: 3³ - 2³ = 27-8 = 19
   These give completely different results.

The proposed answer grows much faster than the ground truth and doesn't match the problem's requirements.
