Ground Truth Answer: fun m n r s => (min (m : ℝ) (n : ℝ)) ^ (1/r - 1/s)
Proposed Answer: fun m n r s => (m : ℝ)^(1/r - 1/s) * (n : ℝ)^(1/s - 1/r)
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: (min(m,n))^(1/r - 1/s)
2. Proposed: m^(1/r - 1/s) * n^(1/s - 1/r)

The proposed answer can be rewritten as:
(m/n)^(1/r - 1/s)

This is clearly different from the ground truth, which takes the minimum of m and n. The proposed answer depends on the ratio m/n, while the ground truth depends only on the smaller dimension.

For example:
- If m=2, n=3, r=2, s=3:
  Ground truth: min(2,3)^(1/2-1/3) = 2^(1/6) ≈ 1.122
  Proposed: (2/3)^(1/6) * (3/2)^(-1/6) ≈ 0.89

The answers give different results, so they are not equivalent.
