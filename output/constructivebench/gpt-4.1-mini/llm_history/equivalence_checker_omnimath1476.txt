Ground Truth Answer: -1/8
Proposed Answer: -1 / 4
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the minimum value of (a-b)(b-c)(c-d)(d-a) under the constraint a²+b²+c²+d²=1.

2. The ground truth answer is -1/8, which is correct based on known mathematical results for this type of optimization problem.

3. The proposed answer is -1/4, which is twice as large as the correct minimum value.

4. The minimum value -1/8 can be achieved with specific values of a,b,c,d that satisfy the constraint, while -1/4 cannot be achieved under the given constraint.

5. The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the actual minimum value achievable under the given conditions.
