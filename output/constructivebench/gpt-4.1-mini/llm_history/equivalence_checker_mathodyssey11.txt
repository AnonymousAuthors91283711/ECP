[check_equivalence] Problem: import Mathlib

open Set Function Real

noncomputable abbrev mathodyssey11_answer : ℕ → ℚ := sorry
theorem mathodyssey11 (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) :
  IsLeast {q : ℚ | ∃ (m : ℕ), 0 < m ∧ q = mathodyssey11_answer m} 13 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (Nat.card {y | ∃ x ∈ Set.Ico 0 (n : ℝ), y = ⌊x * ⌊x⌋⌋} + 90) / n
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n = 1 then 13 else 13 + ((n - 1) : ℚ)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function mathodyssey11_answer : ℕ → ℚ that satisfies a certain least element property (13 being the least value in the range when n > 0).

2. The ground truth answer is a complex function involving cardinality of a set of floor functions, plus 90, divided by n.

3. The proposed answer is a simple piecewise function that returns 13 for n=1 and 13 + (n-1) otherwise.

The two answers are clearly different in structure and behavior:
- The ground truth answer involves non-trivial mathematical operations and will produce different values for different n
- The proposed answer is linear in nature after n=1

The proposed answer doesn't match the complexity or behavior of the ground truth answer, and there's no indication that they would produce the same results.
