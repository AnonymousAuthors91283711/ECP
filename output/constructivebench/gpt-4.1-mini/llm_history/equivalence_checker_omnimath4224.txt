Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => (a + b) / Nat.gcd a b
Proposed Answer: fun a b => b - a + 1
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the smallest positive integer k such that iterating a certain function k times brings 0 back to 0. The function adds 'a' when below/at midpoint M, and subtracts 'b' when above M.

2. The ground truth answer suggests the period is related to the least common multiple concept (since (a+b)/gcd(a,b) is equivalent to lcm(a,b) when a+b = lcm(a,b)).

3. The proposed answer suggests a linear relationship (b - a + 1), which doesn't account for the periodic nature of the problem or the gcd/lcm relationship.

4. For example, take a=2, b=4:
   - Ground truth: (2+4)/gcd(2,4) = 6/2 = 3
   - Proposed: 4-2+1 = 3
   This case matches, but consider a=3, b=6:
   - Ground truth: (3+6)/gcd(3,6) = 9/3 = 3
   - Proposed: 6-3+1 = 4
   These don't match.

The proposed answer only works in specific cases (when b = a*(k+1) for some k), but fails in general.
