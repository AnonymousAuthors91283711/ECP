Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (1 / 6)^n
Proposed Answer: fun n => (1 / 3) ^ n
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem defines a linear functional f on functions from Fin n to ℚ with two properties:
   - Linearity in each argument (h_linear)
   - Special values when inputs are 3 or 4 (h_special)

2. The goal is to find f when all inputs are 5.

3. The ground truth answer is (1/6)^n, which suggests that:
   - The functional behaves like a product of linear forms
   - The value at 5 should be consistent with interpolation from values at 3 and 4

4. The proposed answer is (1/3)^n, which differs from the ground truth.

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It doesn't satisfy the interpolation between the known values at 3 and 4
- The correct scaling factor should be 1/6 (from 5 being midpoint between 3 and 4 in some sense)
