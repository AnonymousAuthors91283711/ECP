Ground Truth Answer: {⟨√30 / 3, √30 / 4, 2 * √30 / 5⟩, ⟨√30 / 3, √30 / 2, √30 / 5⟩}
Proposed Answer: { (a, b, c) : ℝ × ℝ × ℝ |
  a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ c > 0 ∧ floor a = 1 ∧ floor b = 2 ∧ floor c = 3 ∧
  b * c = 3 ∧ a * c = 2 ∧ a * b = 5 / 3 }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

The problem is looking for all triples (a,b,c) of positive real numbers where:
1. floor(a)*b*c = 3
2. a*floor(b)*c = 4
3. a*b*floor(c) = 5

The ground truth provides two exact solutions that satisfy these conditions. Let's check if the proposed answer is equivalent:

1. The proposed answer assumes floor(a)=1, floor(b)=2, floor(c)=3
2. This leads to the simplified equations:
   - 1*b*c = 3 → b*c = 3
   - a*2*c = 4 → a*c = 2
   - a*b*3 = 5 → a*b = 5/3

However, the proposed answer doesn't provide the explicit solutions like the ground truth does. More importantly, it's missing one of the cases that appears in the ground truth (the second tuple). The proposed answer would only lead to one solution (the first tuple in ground truth) when solved.

The second tuple in ground truth corresponds to a different case where floor(b) might be 1 instead of 2, which isn't covered in the proposed answer's constraints.
