Ground Truth Answer: fun x y z => y + z
Proposed Answer: fun x y z => (x - y) * (z - x) * (z - y)
Let's analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

1. The ground truth answer is simply `y + z`, which is clearly positive under the given constraints:
   - From `hz`: z > 1
   - From `hy`: y > -1, so y + z > -1 + 1 = 0

2. The proposed answer is `(x - y) * (z - x) * (z - y)`:
   - `x - y`: Since x > 0 and y < 0, x - y > 0
   - `z - x`: Since z > 1 and x < 1, z - x > 0
   - `z - y`: Since z > 1 and y < 0, z - y > 1 - 0 = 1 > 0
   - Therefore the product is positive

While both expressions are positive under the given constraints, they are clearly different functions. The proposed answer is more complicated and involves all three variables, while the ground truth only uses y and z. They are not equivalent functions, though both satisfy the positivity condition.
