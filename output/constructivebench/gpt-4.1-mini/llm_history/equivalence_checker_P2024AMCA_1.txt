abbrev P2024AMCA_1_answer : â„• := sorry
theorem P2024AMCA_1 :
  9901 * 101 - 99 * 10101 = P2024AMCA_1_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: 9901 * 101 - 99 * 10101
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to simplify the expression `9901 * 101 - 99 * 10101` and find its numerical value.

2. Ground Truth Answer is given as `2`, which is correct because:
   - `9901 * 101 = 1,000,001`
   - `99 * 10101 = 999,999`
   - `1,000,001 - 999,999 = 2`

3. The Proposed Answer simply repeats the original expression `9901 * 101 - 99 * 10101` without simplifying it to its final numerical value of `2`.

The Proposed Answer is not equivalent to the Ground Truth Answer because it doesn't provide the simplified result.
