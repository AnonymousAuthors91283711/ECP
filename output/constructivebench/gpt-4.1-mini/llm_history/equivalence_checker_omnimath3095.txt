abbrev omnimath3095_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3095 : 
  ∀ (players : Finset ℕ) (h : players.card = 5), 
    3 * (players.card.choose 2) = omnimath3095_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 30
Proposed Answer: 10
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the value of 3 * (5 choose 2), where 5 is the number of players.

2. Calculating (5 choose 2):
   - This is the number of ways to choose 2 players out of 5
   - Formula: n choose k = n! / (k!(n-k)!)
   - So 5 choose 2 = 5! / (2!3!) = (120)/(2*6) = 10

3. Now multiply by 3: 3 * 10 = 30

4. The ground truth answer is 30, which is correct.

5. The proposed answer is 10, which is just the (5 choose 2) part without multiplying by 3.

The proposed answer is incomplete as it doesn't include the multiplication by 3 that's specified in the problem.
