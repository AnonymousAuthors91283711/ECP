theorem P2013AMCB_6 (x y : ℝ) :
    x^2 + y^2 = 10*x - 6*y - 34 → x + y = P2013AMCB_6_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives a circle equation: x² + y² = 10x - 6y - 34
2. We can rewrite this in standard form by completing the squares:
   x² - 10x + y² + 6y = -34
   (x² - 10x + 25) + (y² + 6y + 9) = -34 + 25 + 9
   (x-5)² + (y+3)² = 0

3. The only solution to this equation is when both squares equal zero:
   x - 5 = 0 → x = 5
   y + 3 = 0 → y = -3

4. Therefore, x + y = 5 + (-3) = 2

The ground truth answer is 2, while the proposed answer is 8. These are clearly different values.
