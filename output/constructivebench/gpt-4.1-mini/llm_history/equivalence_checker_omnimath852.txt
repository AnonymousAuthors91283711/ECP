Ground Truth Answer: 42
Proposed Answer: 64 + 88 + 120 + 165 - (4 + 8 + 15 + 9)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem is asking for four positive integers (a,b,c,d) whose pairwise products {ab, bc, cd, da} equal the set {64, 88, 120, 165}, and then find the minimal sum a+b+c+d that satisfies this condition.

2. The ground truth answer is 42, which comes from the solution (a,b,c,d) = (8,8,15,11) where:
   - 8*8 = 64
   - 8*15 = 120
   - 15*11 = 165
   - 11*8 = 88
   And the sum is 8+8+15+11 = 42

3. The proposed answer is calculating 64+88+120+165 - (4+8+15+9) = 437 - 36 = 401, which is completely different from 42.

The proposed answer doesn't make sense mathematically in this context. It's not equivalent to the ground truth answer, nor is it a correct approach to solving the problem.
