Ground Truth Answer: (3^59 + 1) / (4 * 3^59)
Proposed Answer: (3^(59) + 1 : ℚ) / (4 * 3^(59))
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both expressions represent the same mathematical quantity, with the only difference being the explicit type annotation `: ℚ` in the proposed answer, which doesn't change the value of the expression. The exponentiation and division operations are identical in both cases.
