    (z^2).im = (z^3).im ↔ b = P2007AIMEI_3_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 15
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves finding a real number b > 0 such that for z = 9 + b*i, the imaginary parts of z² and z³ are equal.

2. Calculating:
   - z² = (9 + b*i)² = (81 - b²) + 18b*i
   - z³ = (9 + b*i)³ = (729 - 27b²) + (243b - b³)*i

3. Setting the imaginary parts equal:
   18b = 243b - b³
   => b³ - 225b = 0
   => b(b² - 225) = 0

4. Solutions: b = 0 or b = ±15
   Since hb requires b > 0, the only valid solution is b = 15.

The ground truth answer is 15, while the proposed answer is 4. These are clearly different values, and 4 doesn't satisfy the equation (4³ - 225*4 = 64 - 900 = -836 ≠ 0).
