abbrev omnimath403_answer : Set (ℤ × ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath403 (m n : ℤ) : 231 * m^2 = 130 * n^2 ↔ (m, n) ∈ omnimath403_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0)}
Proposed Answer: {(m, n) | ∃ k : ℤ, m = 15 * k ∧ n = 21 * k}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all integer pairs (m,n) such that 231*m² = 130*n².

2. The ground truth answer is {(0,0)}, meaning only (0,0) satisfies the equation.

3. The proposed answer suggests all pairs where m = 15k and n = 21k for some integer k.

Now let's test the proposed answer:
- For k=0: (0,0) → 231*0 = 130*0 (valid)
- For k=1: (15,21) → 231*225 = 130*441 → 51975 = 57330 (false)
- For k=-1: (-15,-21) → same as above (false)

Only k=0 works, meaning only (0,0) is valid. The proposed answer incorrectly includes other pairs that don't satisfy the equation.

<<<False>>>
