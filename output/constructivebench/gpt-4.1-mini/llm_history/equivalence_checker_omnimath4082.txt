Ground Truth Answer: {fun x => 2 * x}
Proposed Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c > 0, ∀ x > 0, f x = c * x}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is close but not exactly equivalent to the ground truth. The ground truth specifies exactly the function f(x) = 2x, while the proposed answer allows for any positive linear function f(x) = c*x where c > 0. However, if we substitute f(x) = c*x into the original functional equation, we find that c must equal 2 to satisfy the equation. Therefore, the proposed answer is too general and includes functions that don't satisfy the original condition.
