The error arises because the answer `omnimath3892_answer` is declared outside the theorem and tries to reference variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, which are only in scope inside the theorem statement. To fix this, the answer must be expressed as a function of these variables or be defined inside the theorem.

From the given conditions:

- \( a + d = 2015 \)
- \( b + c = 2015 \)
- and from the equation \((x - a)(x - b) = (x - c)(x - d)\),

expanding both sides and simplifying leads to a constant polynomial in \(x\), whose only solution is at the midpoint \(\frac{a + b + c + d}{2}\).

Since \(a + d = 2015\) and \(b + c = 2015\), their sum is \(a+b+c+d = 4030\), so the solution simplifies to \(2015\).

Therefore, the answer simplifies to 2015, which is fully determined by the given equations, independent of the individual variables.

Hence, the final closed form for the solution set is the singleton \(\{2015\}\).

In Lean, we can express it as `2015` since it is a real number and the set is `{2015}`.
