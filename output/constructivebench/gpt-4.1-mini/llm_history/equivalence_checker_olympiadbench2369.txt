theorem olympiadbench2369 :
  ∃! (gh : ℕ × ℕ), 19 * gh.1 + 17 * gh.2 = 201 ∧ gh.1 > 0 ∧ gh.2 > 0 ∧ olympiadbench2369_answer = gh := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: (7, 4)
Proposed Answer: (8, 5)
Let's verify the proposed answer (8,5) against the equation 19x + 17y = 201:

19*8 + 17*5 = 152 + 85 = 237 ≠ 201

Now verify the ground truth answer (7,4):
19*7 + 17*4 = 133 + 68 = 201

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the equation, while the ground truth does.

<<<False>>>
