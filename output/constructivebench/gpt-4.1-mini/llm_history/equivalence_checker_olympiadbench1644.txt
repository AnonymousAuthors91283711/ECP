Ground Truth Answer: fun m n => m * n - (m / 2)
Proposed Answer: fun m n => m * n + m + n
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed on a grid with certain constraints. The dominoes must be either horizontal or vertical, cannot overlap, and have specific positioning rules.

2. The ground truth answer `m * n - (m / 2)` suggests:
   - A base of m*n (which would make sense for a grid)
   - Subtracting m/2 (accounting for some constraint or overlap)

3. The proposed answer `m * n + m + n` suggests:
   - A base of m*n
   - Adding both m and n terms

Analysis:
- The proposed answer grows much faster than the ground truth answer as m and n increase
- The subtraction in the ground truth answer suggests a limiting factor that the proposed answer doesn't account for
- The proposed answer doesn't match the expected behavior where constraints would reduce, not increase, the maximum number of dominoes

Conclusion: The answers are not equivalent.
