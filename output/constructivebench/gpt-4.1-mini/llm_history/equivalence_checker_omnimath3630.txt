Ground Truth Answer: {1, 2, 3, 5}
Proposed Answer: {1, 3, 8, 120}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a set of 4 natural numbers where any permutation {a,b,c,d} of them satisfies that:
   - a*b + c*d is prime
   - a*c + b*d is prime
   - a*d + b*c is prime

2. Ground truth answer {1,2,3,5}:
   - All combinations like (1*2 + 3*5) = 17 (prime), (1*3 + 2*5) = 13 (prime), etc. work

3. Proposed answer {1,3,8,120}:
   - Let's test some combinations:
     - 1*3 + 8*120 = 963 (not prime, divisible by 3)
     - 1*8 + 3*120 = 368 (not prime, divisible by 2)
     - 1*120 + 3*8 = 144 (not prime)

The proposed answer fails multiple tests where the ground truth answer passes. They are not equivalent.
