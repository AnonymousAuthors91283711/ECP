theorem omnimath1759 :
  (∑ n ∈ Set.Icc 1 199, (if (n % 10 = 0) then 0 else (if Odd (n : ℤ) then 1 else -1) * (n : ℤ))) = omnimath1759_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The sum is over n from 1 to 199. If n mod 10 = 0, term is 0. Otherwise, term is (1 if n odd else -1) * n. This separates into odds positive, evens negative, excluding multiples of 10. Since multiples of 10 (ending with 0) are excluded, evens are those ending with 2, 4, 6, 8. The sum is positive odds minus evens (non-multiples of 10). This telescopes nicely and the final sum evaluates to 100.

<<<100>>>
