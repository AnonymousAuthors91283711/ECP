theorem omnimath3451 :
  let m_last := 100 / 1.25
  let s_last := 100 / 0.8
  m_last + s_last = omnimath3451_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 205
Proposed Answer: 80 + 125
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines:
   - m_last = 100 / 1.25
   - s_last = 100 / 0.8
   - Then asks for m_last + s_last

2. Calculations:
   - 100 / 1.25 = 80
   - 100 / 0.8 = 125
   - Sum: 80 + 125 = 205

3. Ground truth gives the final sum (205)
4. Proposed answer gives the intermediate steps (80 + 125) which clearly sums to 205

The proposed answer shows the intermediate calculations that lead to the ground truth answer. While not identical in form, they are mathematically equivalent since 80 + 125 = 205.
