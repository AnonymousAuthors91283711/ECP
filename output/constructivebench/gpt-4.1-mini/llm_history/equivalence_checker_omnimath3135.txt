Ground Truth Answer: 2/5
Proposed Answer: 3 / 10
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating the probability that two distinct elements from set S = {-3, -1, 0, 2, 4} multiply to 0.

2. Total number of ordered pairs (a,b) where a ≠ b:
   - There are 5 elements in S
   - Total ordered pairs = 5 × 4 = 20 (since a ≠ b)

3. Favorable pairs where a × b = 0:
   - The only way this can happen is if one element is 0
   - Possible pairs: (0, -3), (0, -1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (-3, 0), (-1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0)
   - Total favorable pairs = 8

4. Probability calculation:
   - 8 favorable / 20 total = 2/5

The ground truth answer (2/5) is correct. The proposed answer (3/10) is incorrect as it doesn't match the correct calculation.
