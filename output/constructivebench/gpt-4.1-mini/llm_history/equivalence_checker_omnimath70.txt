Ground Truth Answer: fun n => if Odd n then n^2 - n + 1 else n^2
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 2 * n - 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of even entries possible in an n×n integer matrix after performing a series of operations (adding 1 to entire rows and columns).

2. The ground truth answer shows a piecewise function:
   - For odd n: n² - n + 1
   - For even n: n²

3. The proposed answer is a simple linear function: 2n - 1

Let's test some values:
- n=1 (odd):
  - Ground truth: 1-1+1 = 1
  - Proposed: 2*1-1 = 1 (matches)
- n=2 (even):
  - Ground truth: 4
  - Proposed: 3 (doesn't match)
- n=3 (odd):
  - Ground truth: 9-3+1 = 7
  - Proposed: 5 (doesn't match)

The answers only match at n=1 and diverge elsewhere. The proposed answer is incorrect for most cases.
