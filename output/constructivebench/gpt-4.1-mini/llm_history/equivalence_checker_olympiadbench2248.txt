Ground Truth Answer: -84
Proposed Answer: 18
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two equations:
   - f(x) + g(x) = 3x + 5
   - f(x) - g(x) = 5x + 7

2. We can solve for f(x) and g(x) by adding and subtracting these equations:
   - Adding: 2f(x) = 8x + 12 ⇒ f(x) = 4x + 6
   - Subtracting: 2g(x) = -2x - 2 ⇒ g(x) = -x - 1

3. Now calculate f(2) and g(2):
   - f(2) = 4*2 + 6 = 14
   - g(2) = -2 - 1 = -3

4. Compute 2 * f(2) * g(2):
   - 2 * 14 * (-3) = -84

The ground truth answer is -84, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 18, which is incorrect.
