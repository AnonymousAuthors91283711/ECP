abbrev P2002AMCB_2_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem P2002AMCB_2 (x : ℝ) : 
    (3 * x - 2) * (4 * x + 1) - ((3 * x - 2) * 4 * x) + 1 = P2002AMCB_2_answer x := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => (3 * x - 2) * (4 * x + 1) - (3 * x - 2) * 4 * x + 1
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℝ => 1 - 2 * x
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents an equation to simplify: (3x-2)(4x+1) - (3x-2)*4x + 1
2. Ground truth answer keeps the expression in its original form (no simplification)
3. Proposed answer claims it simplifies to 1 - 2x

Let's verify the simplification:
(3x-2)(4x+1) - (3x-2)*4x + 1
= (12x² + 3x - 8x - 2) - (12x² - 8x) + 1
= (12x² - 5x - 2) - 12x² + 8x + 1
= -5x - 2 + 8x + 1
= 3x - 1

The correct simplification is 3x - 1, not 1 - 2x as proposed.
