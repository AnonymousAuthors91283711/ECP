Ground Truth Answer: 20
Proposed Answer: 3
Let's analyze this problem:

1. The problem asks to find a natural number n > 0 where the number of divisors of n^n equals 861.

2. The ground truth answer is 20. Let's verify this:
   - 20 = 2^2 * 5^1
   - The divisor function formula gives: τ(n^n) = (n+1)^k where k is the number of distinct prime factors
   - For n=20: τ(20^20) = (2*20+1)(1*20+1) = 41*21 = 861
   - This matches the condition hdiv

3. The proposed answer is 3:
   - 3 is prime
   - τ(3^3) = 3+1 = 4 ≠ 861
   - This doesn't satisfy the condition

The proposed answer (3) is clearly incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the divisor count condition, while the ground truth answer (20) does.

<<<False>>>
