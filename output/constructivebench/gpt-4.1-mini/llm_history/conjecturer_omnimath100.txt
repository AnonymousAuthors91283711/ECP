Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 65, which is at ", y = 2, z = -3}" in "abbrev omnimath100_answer : Set (ℝ × ℝ × ℝ) := {(x, y, z) | x = 3, y = 2, z = -3}", there is an error: unexpected token ','; expected '}'.

The error comes from the syntax used for defining the set with properties in Lean. The set comprehension notation in Lean uses `Set` and the appropriate constructor is `SetOf` or the notation ` {x | p x } ` without commas separating conditions inside a single predicate. We cannot separate conditions with commas, but must write a single predicate with `∧` for "and".

Your intended set is the singleton point `(3, 2, -3)`, so the set is simply `{(3, 2, -3)}` as a set of triples of reals.

Hence the corrected final answer should be:

<<<{(3, 2, -3)}>>>
