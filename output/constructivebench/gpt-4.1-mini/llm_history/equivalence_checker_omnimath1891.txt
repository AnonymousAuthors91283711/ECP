theorem omnimath1891 :
  let divisors := Nat.divisors 2016
  let n := divisors.card
  (∑ d in divisors, (1 : ℚ)/n * (d^2 / (d^2 + 2016))) = omnimath1891_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1/2
Proposed Answer: (1 / (Nat.divisors 2016).card : ℚ) * ∑ d ∈ Nat.divisors 2016, (d ^ 2 : ℚ) / (d ^ 2 + 2016)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. The ground truth answer is 1/2, which is the simplified form of the expression given in the proposed answer. The proposed answer correctly represents the summation and scaling by 1/n (where n is the number of divisors of 2016) as specified in the problem statement. The equivalence can be verified by evaluating the sum and confirming it simplifies to 1/2.
