Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: 14
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem states relationships between Janice's current age (Janice_now), her age 2 years ago (Janice_2yearsago), and her age in 12 years (Janice_12years).

2. The ground truth answer is 4. Let's verify this:
   - If Janice_now = 4:
     - Janice_2yearsago = 4 - 2 = 2
     - Janice_12years = 4 + 12 = 16
     - 16 = 8 * 2 (which is true)

3. The proposed answer is 14. Let's test this:
   - If Janice_now = 14:
     - Janice_2yearsago = 14 - 2 = 12
     - Janice_12years = 14 + 12 = 26
     - 26 = 8 * 12 → 26 = 96 (which is false)

The proposed answer (14) does not satisfy the given condition, while the ground truth answer (4) does.

<<<False>>>
