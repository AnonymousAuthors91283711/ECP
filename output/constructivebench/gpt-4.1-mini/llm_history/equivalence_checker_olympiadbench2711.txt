Ground Truth Answer: 2019
Proposed Answer: 2203
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest number greater than 2013 that cannot be expressed as the sum of two palindromic numbers (with the given constraints that palindromes can't start or end with 0).

2. The ground truth answer is 2019. This is correct because:
   - 2014 = 1551 + 463
   - 2015 = 1331 + 684
   - 2016 = 1221 + 795
   - 2017 = 1111 + 906
   - 2018 = 1001 + 1017
   - But 2019 cannot be expressed as such a sum

3. The proposed answer is 2203. This is incorrect because:
   - There are smaller numbers (like 2019) that satisfy the condition
   - 2203 is not the least such number
   - The answer fails to meet the "IsLeast" requirement of the theorem

Therefore, the proposed answer is not equivalent to the ground truth answer.
