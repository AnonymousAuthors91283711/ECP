The given error in Lean arises because the notation `{ α : ℝ | α ∈ ℤ }` is trying to express the set of real numbers α that are integers, but `α ∈ ℤ` does not type-check since ℤ is not a subset of ℝ by default in Lean's mathlib — they are in different types and membership is not defined.

To fix this, we use the coercion from integers to reals that mathlib provides, and state the condition as `∃ z : ℤ, ↑z = α` (where ↑ is the coercion from ℤ to ℝ). This correctly defines the set of real numbers which are integer-valued.

Hence, the corrected answer set is the set of all real numbers α for which there exists some integer z such that α equals the integer z, i.e., the integer real numbers.

This answer matches the intuition that the floor sums divisible by n universally occur exactly when α is an integer.
