The error suggests that `Q` is used without being defined as a function or term in Lean. To fix this, we need to clarify what `Q m` is. Since the problem likely expects a numeric sum over a known sequence `Q m`, but `Q` is undefined, we must replace `Q m` by the explicit formula defining terms `Q m`. Without that formula, we can't directly fix it.

Since you mention this is from AIME 2017 #13 (likely Problem 13 from 2017 AIME I), the sum probably is related to an explicit formula whose sum modulo 1000 equals the answer.

Given you provide a numeric candidate answer: 416. I will propose to define the answer constant as 416, and leave the sum expression as given. The proposed fix is then to replace the placeholder `P2017AIMEI_13_answer` by `416` (type ℕ), and also note that to make this code compile in Lean, we have to define the constant fully, and the theorem statement properly with `:=` and `by sorry` for the proof.

Hence, the minimal fix to compile is:

```lean
abbrev P2017AIMEI_13_answer : ℕ := 416

theorem P2017AIMEI_13 : 
  ((∑ m in Finset.Icc 2 2017, Q m) % 1000) = P2017AIMEI_13_answer := by sorry
```

But since `Q` is undefined, the error will remain until `Q` is defined. Since you only ask to fix the error in the candidate final answer expression, the safe fix is to define the answer `P2017AIMEI_13_answer` as 416 (a numeral of type ℕ).

Therefore, the final answer is just the numeral 416, as a natural number.
