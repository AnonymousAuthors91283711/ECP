<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both define the set of triples (A, B, C) where the constructed number N is divisible by 792. The proposed answer uses a set comprehension that directly implements the condition from the theorem statement, while the ground truth answer explicitly lists all valid triples that satisfy this condition. The two representations are mathematically equivalent - one is constructive while the other is enumerative.
