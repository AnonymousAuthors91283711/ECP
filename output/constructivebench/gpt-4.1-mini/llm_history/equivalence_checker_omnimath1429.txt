Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

The problem presents a recursive expectation equation for some process with three possible outcomes (H, M, T) with probabilities 1/4, 1/2, and 1/4 respectively. The equation is:

E = 1 + p_H*E + p_M*(1 + p_H*E + p_M*0 + p_T*E) + p_T*E

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Substitute the probabilities:
E = 1 + (1/4)E + (1/2)(1 + (1/4)E + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)E) + (1/4)E

2. Simplify the inner expression:
E = 1 + (1/4)E + (1/2)(1 + (1/4)E + 0 + (1/4)E) + (1/4)E
E = 1 + (1/4)E + (1/2)(1 + (1/2)E) + (1/4)E

3. Distribute the (1/2):
E = 1 + (1/4)E + 1/2 + (1/4)E + (1/4)E

4. Combine like terms:
E = (1 + 1/2) + (1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4)E
E = 3/2 + (3/4)E

5. Subtract (3/4)E from both sides:
(1/4)E = 3/2

6. Multiply both sides by 4:
E = 6

The ground truth answer is indeed 6, while the proposed answer is 4. These are not equivalent.
