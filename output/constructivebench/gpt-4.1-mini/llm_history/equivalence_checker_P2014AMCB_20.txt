Ground Truth Answer: 18
Proposed Answer: 20
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the number of natural numbers x > 0 that satisfy:
   log(x - 40) + log(60 - x) < 2

2. First, we need to determine the domain where the expression is defined:
   - x - 40 > 0 ⇒ x > 40
   - 60 - x > 0 ⇒ x < 60
   So x must be in 41..59

3. The inequality can be rewritten using logarithm properties:
   log((x-40)(60-x)) < 2
   (x-40)(60-x) < 100 (since log base 10 is implied)

4. Let's analyze (x-40)(60-x) = -x² + 100x - 2400
   We need -x² + 100x - 2400 < 100
   ⇒ -x² + 100x - 2500 < 0
   ⇒ x² - 100x + 2500 > 0
   ⇒ (x - 50)² > 0

5. The solution is all x ≠ 50 in the domain 41..59
   That means x ∈ {41..49, 51..59} (18 values)

The ground truth answer is 18 (correct), while the proposed answer is 20 (incorrect).
