Ground Truth Answer: 2^1100
Proposed Answer: 2^(11*11 - 2*11)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting the number of 11×11 matrices with:
   - Entries between 1 and 2^10 (inclusive)
   - Row sums divisible by 2^n for the nth row
   - Column sums divisible by 2^n for the nth column

2. The ground truth answer is 2^1100, which suggests complete freedom in choosing all entries (since 11×11×10 = 1210 bits of information, but this doesn't match).

3. The proposed answer is 2^(11*11 - 2*11) = 2^(121-22) = 2^99.

The proposed answer seems incorrect because:
- It's much smaller than the ground truth answer
- The constraints should reduce the degrees of freedom more significantly (each row/column sum condition removes one degree of freedom per constraint)
- The exponent calculation doesn't properly account for the varying divisibility conditions (2^n for nth row/column)
