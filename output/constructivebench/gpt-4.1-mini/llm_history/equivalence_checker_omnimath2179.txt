  card {s : Finset (Fin 6 × Fin 6) | card s = 3 ∧ ∀ (x y : Fin 6 × Fin 6), x ∈ s → y ∈ s → x ≠ y → x.1 ≠ y.1 ∧ x.2 ≠ y.2} = omnimath2179_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 6 * 5 * 4 * (6 * 5 * 4 / 6)
Proposed Answer: 400
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
- We're counting the number of 3-element subsets of a 6×6 grid (Fin 6 × Fin 6) where:
  1. No two points share the same x-coordinate
  2. No two points share the same y-coordinate
- This is equivalent to selecting 3 distinct rows and 3 distinct columns, then choosing a permutation of columns to rows.

Ground Truth Answer Analysis:
- 6 * 5 * 4: Choosing 3 distinct rows (6 choices for first, 5 for second, 4 for third)
- (6 * 5 * 4 / 6): Choosing 3 distinct columns (6*5*4) divided by 6 for permutation symmetry
- This gives 6*5*4 * (6*5*4/6) = 6*5*4*5*4 = 1200

Proposed Answer Analysis:
- The proposed answer is 400, which is different from the correct count of 1200.
