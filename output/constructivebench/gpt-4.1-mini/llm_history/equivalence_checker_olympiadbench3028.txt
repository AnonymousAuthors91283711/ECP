Ground Truth Answer: 20
Proposed Answer: 19
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. Given:
   - T = 362
   - K = √(T - 1) = √361 = 19

2. The expression to evaluate is:
   |(K - 20)(K + 1) + 19K - K²|

3. Substitute K = 19:
   |(19 - 20)(19 + 1) + 19*19 - 19²|
   = |(-1)(20) + 361 - 361|
   = |-20 + 0|
   = 20

The ground truth answer is 20, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 19, which is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
