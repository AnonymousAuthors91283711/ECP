Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n^2 / 4 + n / 2
Proposed Answer: fun n => n * (n / 2)
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. Ground truth: n²/4 + n/2
2. Proposed: n*(n/2) = n²/2

For even n > 0:
Let's test with n=2:
- Ground truth: 4/4 + 2/2 = 1 + 1 = 2
- Proposed: 2*(2/2) = 2*1 = 2

n=4:
- Ground truth: 16/4 + 4/2 = 4 + 2 = 6
- Proposed: 4*(4/2) = 4*2 = 8

n=6:
- Ground truth: 36/4 + 6/2 = 9 + 3 = 12
- Proposed: 6*(6/2) = 6*3 = 18

We can see that while the answers match for n=2, they diverge for larger even numbers. The proposed answer grows faster than the ground truth.
