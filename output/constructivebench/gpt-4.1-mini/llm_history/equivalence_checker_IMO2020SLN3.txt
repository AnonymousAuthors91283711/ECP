Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n ≥ 2 → ¬∃ (a : Fin n → ℕ), (¬∀ i j, a i = a j) ∧ 
    ∀ i j, ∃ k, (a i + a j) / 2 = a k ∧ ∃ l, a k = a l ^ 2
Proposed Answer: fun n => n < 3
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth states that for n ≥ 2, there doesn't exist a non-constant function a: Fin n → ℕ satisfying the given conditions about arithmetic and geometric means.

The proposed answer says "n < 3", which is equivalent to n ≤ 2 since n is a natural number.

These are not equivalent because:
1. The ground truth is about n ≥ 2 (n = 2,3,4,...)
2. The proposed answer is about n ≤ 2 (n = 0,1,2)

They only agree when n = 2, but disagree for all other values of n. The ground truth makes a claim about larger n values (≥2) while the proposed answer makes a claim about smaller n values (≤2).
