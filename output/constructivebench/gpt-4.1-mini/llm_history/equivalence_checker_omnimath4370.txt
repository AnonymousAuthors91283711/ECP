Ground Truth Answer: True
Proposed Answer: ∃ s : Finset ℕ, s.card = 100 ∧ ∃ m ∈ s, m ^ 3 = ∑ x ∈ s.erase m, x ^ 3
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but omits the condition ∀ x ∈ s, ∀ y ∈ s, x ≠ y (all elements in the set are distinct). While this condition might be implied by using Finset (which typically contains distinct elements by definition), it's better to be explicit in competition problems. The core structure of the answer is correct, but it's missing this important constraint.
