Ground Truth Answer: -63
Proposed Answer: 17955 / 3
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is asking for three distinct integers a, b, c that satisfy several conditions, including:
1. They form an arithmetic sequence (b-a = c-b)
2. Their product is 17955
3. There's a ratio r relating certain linear combinations
4. The final answer is the sum a + b + c

The ground truth answer is -63, while the proposed answer is 17955/3 = 5985.

Key observations:
1. For three numbers in arithmetic progression, their sum is always 3 times the middle term (a + b + c = 3b)
2. The product condition a*b*c = 17955 is separate from the sum
3. The proposed answer incorrectly assumes the sum equals the product divided by 3, which isn't justified by the problem conditions
4. The actual solution involves finding numbers where 3b = -63 (so b = -21) and the other conditions hold

The proposed answer is completely incorrect as it doesn't satisfy any of the given conditions or match the ground truth.
