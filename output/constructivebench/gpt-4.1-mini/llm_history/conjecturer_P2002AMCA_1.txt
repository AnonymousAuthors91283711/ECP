theorem P2002AMCA_1 : 
  (roots ((2 * X + 3) * (X - 4) + (2 * X + 3) * (X - 6))).sum = P2002AMCA_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The polynomial is \((2X + 3)(X - 4) + (2X + 3)(X - 6) = (2X + 3)(2X - 10) = 4X^2 - 14X - 30\). The sum of roots for \(aX^2 + bX + c\) is \(-b/a = 14/4 = 7/2\).
