Ground Truth Answer: (1, 1/2, -1/2, 1/3)
Proposed Answer: (4, 1, 1, 1)
Let's analyze the proposed answer (4, 1, 1, 1) against the ground truth (1, 1/2, -1/2, 1/3) by checking each equation:

1. First equation: √4 - 1/1 - 2*1 + 3*1 = 2 - 1 - 2 + 3 = 2 ≠ 1 (should be 1)
2. Second equation: 4 + 1/1² - 4*1² - 9*1² = 4 + 1 - 4 - 9 = -8 ≠ 3 (should be 3)
3. Third equation: 4√4 - 1/1³ - 8*1³ + 27*1³ = 8 - 1 - 8 + 27 = 26 ≠ -5 (should be -5)
4. Fourth equation: 4² + 1/1⁴ - 16*1⁴ - 81*1⁴ = 16 + 1 - 16 - 81 = -80 ≠ 15 (should be 15)

The proposed answer fails all four equations, while the ground truth satisfies them all. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
