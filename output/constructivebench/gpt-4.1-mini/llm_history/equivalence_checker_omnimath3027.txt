abbrev omnimath3027_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3027 :
  Real.sqrt ((Real.sqrt 81 + Real.sqrt 81) / 2) = omnimath3027_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step:

1. The problem involves evaluating the expression: √((√81 + √81)/2)
2. First, calculate √81: √81 = 9 (since 9×9=81)
3. The expression becomes: √((9 + 9)/2) = √(18/2) = √9 = 3
4. The ground truth answer correctly evaluates this to 3
5. The proposed answer gives 9, which is incorrect as it appears to be just taking √81 without completing the full calculation

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't complete the full evaluation of the expression.

<<<False>>>
