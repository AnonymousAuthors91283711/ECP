The issue arises because in Lean, the factorial function is not called "i!", but rather is `fact i` or `Nat.factorial i`. Also, for the sum notation, the proper syntax is `∑ i ∈ s, f i`.

Moreover, to express the floor of a rational number, one should use the floor function or the coercion carefully. Since factorials are natural numbers, and the denominator sum is a natural number, but division is rational, we can write a floor of the rational number `(2002)! / (∑ i ∈ Finset.Icc 1 2001, i!)`.

We cannot express the division of two naturals directly as a natural, so we use `rat` or `ℚ` to denote rational numbers. Then we take the floor of the division.

Here, as the problem states, the answer is the floor of `(2002)! / ∑_{i=1}^{2001} i!`.

Also, note that `(2002)!` is not an expression but `Nat.factorial 2002`.

Hence, the correct expression in Lean is:

```lean
⟦(Nat.factorial 2002) / (∑ i ∈ Finset.Icc 1 2001, Nat.factorial i)⟧₊
```

where `⟦_⟧₊` is the floor function from `ℚ` to `ℕ`.

Therefore, setting `omnimath816_answer` as this floor value makes sense.

Since Lean doesn't allow a direct division of natural numbers resulting in a natural number, we have to coerce to `ℚ` first.

So the complete answer is:

```lean
⌊(Nat.factorial 2002 : ℚ) / (∑ i ∈ Finset.Icc 1 2001, (Nat.factorial i : ℚ))⌋₊
```

In Lean syntax:

```lean
⌊(Nat.factorial 2002 : ℚ) / (∑ i ∈ Finset.Icc 1 2001, (Nat.factorial i : ℚ))⌋₊
```

Therefore, the final answer expression is:

<<<
⌊(Nat.factorial 2002 : ℚ) / (∑ i ∈ Finset.Icc 1 2001, (Nat.factorial i : ℚ))⌋₊

The problem asks for the integer floor of (2002)! divided by the sum of factorials from 1! to 2001!. The key observation is that the sum ∑_{i=1}^{2001} i! is very close to 2002! / (2002 - 1)!, but more straightforwardly:

1. The sum of factorials from 1! to 2001! is huge but strictly less than 2002! because 2002! = 2002 × 2001!.
2. Dividing 2002! by that sum roughly approximates to a small integer.
3. The floor integer should be the exact quotient ignoring remainder.

Since the division and taking floor is requested as a natural number, the expression involving division on natural numbers is not allowed directly because division returns a rational number or integer division but floor is a rational floor.

Using `Nat.div` to perform integer division fits naturally: `Nat.div (Nat.factorial 2002) (∑ i in Finset.Icc 1 2001, Nat.factorial i)`

This expression is the floor of the division since integer division in Lean truncates towards zero.

Hence, the corrected Lean expression is:

<<<Nat.div (Nat.factorial 2002) (∑ i ∈ Finset.Icc 1 2001, Nat.factorial i)>>>
