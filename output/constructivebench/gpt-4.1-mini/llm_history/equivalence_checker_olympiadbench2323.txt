theorem olympiadbench2323 :
  {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (n ^ 2 + n + 15) % n = 0} = olympiadbench2323_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {1, 3, 5, 15}
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | n ∣ 15 ∧ 0 < n}
<<<True>>>

Explanation: 
1. The problem asks for natural numbers n > 0 where (n² + n + 15) is divisible by n.
2. This simplifies to n | (n² + n + 15), which further simplifies to n | 15 since n | n² and n | n.
3. The divisors of 15 are exactly {1, 3, 5, 15}.
4. The proposed answer {n : ℕ | n ∣ 15 ∧ 0 < n} is exactly the set of positive divisors of 15.
5. Therefore, the proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer.
