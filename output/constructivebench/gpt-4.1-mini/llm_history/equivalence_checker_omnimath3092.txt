abbrev omnimath3092_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3092 : 
  ∃ (t s : ℕ), 3 + t = 5 ∧ t + s = 7 ∧ t + t + t + s + s = omnimath3092_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 16
Proposed Answer: 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find natural numbers t and s that satisfy three equations:
   - 3 + t = 5
   - t + s = 7
   - t + t + t + s + s = answer

2. From the first equation (3 + t = 5), we get t = 2
3. From the second equation (t + s = 7), with t=2, we get s = 5
4. Now calculate t + t + t + s + s = 2 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 5 = 16

The ground truth answer correctly follows this calculation to get 16. The proposed answer of 7 is incorrect as it doesn't match the calculation.

<<<False>>>
