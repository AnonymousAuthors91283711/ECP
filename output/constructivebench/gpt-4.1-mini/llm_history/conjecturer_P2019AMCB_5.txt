The problem requires the smallest natural number \( n \) such that there exist natural numbers \( r, g, b \) satisfying:
\[
12r = 20n, \quad 14g = 20n, \quad 15b = 20n.
\]
This is equivalent to requiring \( 20n \) to be divisible by 12, 14, and 15 simultaneously.

The least common multiple of the denominators divided on the right side gives
\[
20n \text{ is divisible by } \text{lcm}(12,14,15) = 420.
\]
So:
\[
20n \equiv 0 \pmod{420} \implies n \equiv 0 \pmod{\frac{420}{20}} = 21.
\]
Thus, the smallest such \( n \) is 21.
