abbrev P2006AMCB_6_answer : â„• := sorry
theorem P2006AMCB_6 : 
  P2006AMCB_6_answer = (25 + 386) * 200 / (100 + 100 + 400) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 137
Proposed Answer: (25 + 386) * 200 / (100 + 100 + 400)
Let's analyze this step by step:

1. The problem presents a mathematical expression to evaluate: (25 + 386) * 200 / (100 + 100 + 400)
2. The ground truth answer is given as 137
3. The proposed answer is simply restating the original expression

Calculating the expression:
- Numerator: (25 + 386) = 411; 411 * 200 = 82200
- Denominator: (100 + 100 + 400) = 600
- Division: 82200 / 600 = 137

The proposed answer doesn't actually evaluate the expression to its final numerical value (137), but just repeats the expression. Therefore, it's not equivalent to the ground truth answer.
