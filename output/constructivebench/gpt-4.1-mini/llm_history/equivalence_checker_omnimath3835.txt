Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0), (-2, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(0, 0), (2, -2), (-2, 2), (1, -1), (-1, 1)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all integer pairs (m, n) that satisfy m⁵ - n⁵ = 16mn.

2. Ground truth gives only {(0,0), (-2,2)} as solutions.

3. Proposed answer adds three more pairs: (2,-2), (1,-1), (-1,1).

Let's test the proposed additional solutions:

For (2,-2):
2⁵ - (-2)⁵ = 32 - (-32) = 64
16*2*(-2) = -64
64 ≠ -64 → Not a solution

For (1,-1):
1⁵ - (-1)⁵ = 1 - (-1) = 2
16*1*(-1) = -16
2 ≠ -16 → Not a solution

For (-1,1):
(-1)⁵ - 1⁵ = -1 - 1 = -2
16*(-1)*1 = -16
-2 ≠ -16 → Not a solution

Only (0,0) and (-2,2) are valid solutions from the proposed answer. The other pairs don't satisfy the equation.
