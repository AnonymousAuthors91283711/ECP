<<<252>>>

Explanation: The set consists of choosing 5 members from 10, with a nonempty subset of leaders size 1 to 4. For each 5-member committee, there are (2^5 - 1 - C(5,5)) = 2^5 - 1 = 31 subsets with at least 1 leader, but limited to leaders.card ≤ 4 excludes the full committee (size 5). So number of valid leader sets per committee is 2^5 - 2 = 30. But since the existential only requires existence of such leaders, and any committee of size 5 has such leaders, the number is just C(10,5) = 252.
