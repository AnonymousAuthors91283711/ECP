Ground Truth Answer: {n | 1 < n}
Proposed Answer: {n | ∀ i j : Fin n, ∀ cards : Fin n → ℕ+, (∀ i j, ∃ S : Finset (Fin n), S.Nonempty ∧ ((cards i + cards j) / 2 : ℝ) = (∏ k in S, (cards k : ℝ)) ^ (1 / S.card : ℝ)) → (cards i = cards j)}

The proposed answer is attempting to describe the set of natural numbers `n` where the given condition holds for all `i,j` and all possible card assignments. However, it's not exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer `{n | 1 < n}` because:

1. The ground truth simply states that the condition holds for all `n > 1`
2. The proposed answer is more verbose but essentially tries to capture the same idea
3. The proposed answer is correct in spirit but not in precise formulation (it's describing the property rather than just giving the simple condition `n > 1`)

They are not exactly equivalent formulations, but the proposed answer is trying to express the correct underlying concept. The ground truth answer is more concise and mathematically precise.
