Ground Truth Answer: 2/5
Proposed Answer: (10 : ℚ) / 15
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer (10/15) simplifies to 2/3 when reduced to lowest terms, which does not match the ground truth answer of 2/5. However, let's verify the calculation:

1. The total number of elements in Ω (A × B) is 5 × 3 = 15
2. We need to count pairs (a,b) where a^b is even
3. For a^b to be even, a must be even (since even^any = even, odd^any = odd)
4. In set A, the even numbers are {2,4} (2 elements)
5. Each of these can pair with any of the 3 elements in B
6. So total even_count = 2 × 3 = 6
7. Therefore the probability should be 6/15 = 2/5

The proposed answer of 10/15 is incorrect - it should be 6/15 (which simplifies to 2/5). The correct count of even pairs is 6, not 10.
