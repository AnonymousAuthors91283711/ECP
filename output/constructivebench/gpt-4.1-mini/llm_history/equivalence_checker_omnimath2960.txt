Ground Truth Answer: 109
Proposed Answer: 54
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have four consecutive integers: p, q, r, s where:
   - q = p + 1
   - r = q + 1 = p + 2
   - s = r + 1 = p + 3

2. We're given that p + s = 109
   Substituting s: p + (p + 3) = 109 → 2p + 3 = 109 → 2p = 106 → p = 53

3. Now we can find all numbers:
   - p = 53
   - q = 54
   - r = 55
   - s = 56

4. The problem asks for q + r = 54 + 55 = 109

The ground truth answer is indeed 109, while the proposed answer is 54 (which is just the value of q). The proposed answer is incorrect as it only gives one of the terms being summed rather than their sum.
