Ground Truth Answer: -1 / 2
Proposed Answer: -2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a property P(x,y) as (y + x) = (y - x)² + 3(y - x) + 3
2. We need to find the least y such that there exists an x making P(x,y) true
3. Let's simplify P(x,y):
   Let u = y - x
   Then y + x = y - x + 2x = u + 2x
   The equation becomes: u + 2x = u² + 3u + 3
   Solving for x: 2x = u² + 2u + 3 ⇒ x = (u² + 2u + 3)/2
   Then y = u + x = u + (u² + 2u + 3)/2 = (2u + u² + 2u + 3)/2 = (u² + 4u + 3)/2

4. To find the minimum y, we can minimize (u² + 4u + 3)/2
   The derivative is (2u + 4)/2 = u + 2
   Setting to 0: u = -2
   Then y = ((-2)² + 4*(-2) + 3)/2 = (4 - 8 + 3)/2 = (-1)/2

The ground truth answer (-1/2) is correct, while the proposed answer (-2) is incorrect. The proposed answer seems to be the value of u at the minimum point, not the actual minimum y value.
