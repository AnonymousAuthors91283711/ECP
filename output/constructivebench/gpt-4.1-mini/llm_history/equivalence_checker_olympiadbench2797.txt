Ground Truth Answer: 95
Proposed Answer: 6 + 49
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem involves finding the greatest rational number r satisfying certain conditions, then computing the sum of its numerator and denominator.

2. The ground truth answer is 95, which comes from:
   - The expression simplifies to r = 6/7 + 5/49 * (49/48) = 6/7 + 5/48
   - Converting to common denominator: r = (288 + 35)/336 = 323/336
   - 323 + 336 = 659 (but this doesn't match 95)
   - Wait, there seems to be a miscalculation here. Let's re-examine:
     r = 6/7 + 5/49 * (1/(48/49)) = 6/7 + 5/48
     = (288 + 35)/336 = 323/336
     323 + 336 = 659 ≠ 95
   - This suggests the ground truth answer might be incorrect or there's a different interpretation.

3. The proposed answer is 6 + 49 = 55, which doesn't match either calculation.

Given that neither the ground truth nor the proposed answer matches our calculation, and they don't match each other, the correct response is:

<<<False>>>
