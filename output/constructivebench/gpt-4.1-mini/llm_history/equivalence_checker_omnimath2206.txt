Ground Truth Answer: 100
Proposed Answer: (169 : ℝ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the minimum value of the expression:
   (2cosα + 5sinβ - 8)² + (2sinα + 5cosβ - 15)²

2. The ground truth answer is 100, while the proposed answer is 169.

3. To verify, let's consider the expression as a distance function. We can interpret it as:
   The squared distance between (2cosα, 2sinα) + (5sinβ, 5cosβ) and (8,15).

4. The first vector (2cosα, 2sinα) describes a circle with radius 2.
   The second vector (5sinβ, 5cosβ) describes a circle with radius 5.

5. The maximum distance between the centers of these two circles is when they're in opposite directions: 2 + 5 = 7.
   The minimum distance is |5 - 2| = 3.

6. The point (8,15) is at distance √(8²+15²) = 17 from the origin.

7. The minimum distance would be 17 - (maximum combined radius) = 17 - 7 = 10.
   Squaring this gives the minimum value of the expression: 10² = 100.

The proposed answer of 169 is incorrect as it doesn't match this calculation. The correct minimum value is indeed 100.
