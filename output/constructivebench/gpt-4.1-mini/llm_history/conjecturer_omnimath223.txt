The error in your Lean code is due to the identifier `operation` being undefined. To fix it, you must define `operation` (likely a function from `Fin 10 → ℕ` to itself) before you can use iterates like `operation^[n] A`.

Since the problem does not provide a definition of `operation`, we cannot fully fix the theorem directly. However, assuming `operation` is some known operation on functions from `Fin 10 → ℕ`, your candidate answer `(202, 512)` should be enclosed as a pair. This pair represents the minimal `k` and the cardinality `count`.

Given the lack of full context but trusting the enumerated answer and common patterns (since the sum is `2019`, and minimal `k` no less than 202 makes sense), the final fixed answer expression in Lean should be:
