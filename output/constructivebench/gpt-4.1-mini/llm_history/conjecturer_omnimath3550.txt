The polynomial is \( P_m(x) = x^4 - (2m+4) x^2 + (m-2)^2 \). Factoring \( P_m(x) \) into two nonconstant polynomials over \(\mathbb{Z}\) requires it to factor as \((x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d)\) with integer coefficients. By comparison, since the polynomial is even in \(x\), the middle terms must cancel, so the linear terms vanish, meaning the factorization is of the form \((x^2 + px + q)(x^2 - px + r)\) or directly \((x^2 + s)(x^2 + t)\) with integer \(s,t\).

Matching coefficients:
- constant term = \( (m-2)^2 = q r \)
- sum of quadratic terms = \(- (2m+4) = q + r\)

So the polynomial factorizes if and only if there exist integers \(q, r\) such that:
\[
q + r = -(2m + 4), \quad q r = (m - 2)^2.
\]

These are the coefficients of the quadratic factorization. For \(P_m\) to factor over \(\mathbb{Z}\), the quadratic \(t^2 + (2m+4) t + (m-2)^2 = 0\) must have an integer root (or equivalently the discriminant of the quadratic in \(t\) is a perfect square).

Discriminant:
\[
\Delta_t = (2m+4)^2 - 4 (m-2)^2 = 4 (2m+4)^2 - 4 (m-2)^2.
\]

Simplify:
\[
\Delta_t = (2m +4)^2 - 4 (m-2)^2 = (2m +4)^2 - 4(m^2 - 4m +4)
\]
\[
= 4m^2 + 16 m + 16 - 4m^2 +16 m -16 = 32 m.
\]

So \(\Delta_t = 32 m\).

We require \(\Delta_t\) be a perfect square, i.e., there exists \(r : \mathbb{Z}\) with:
\[
r^2 = 32 m.
\]

Thus the integer \(m\) is such that \(32 m\) is a perfect square integer, i.e., \(m = \frac{r^2}{32}\) for some integer \(r\), which means \(r^2\) divisible by 32, i.e., \(r\) divisible by \(4\) (since \(4^2 = 16\), needs at least \(4^2\) to get 32), so \(m\) must be divisible by 2. But to keep it simple, the set of \(m\) where \(32 m\) is a perfect square is exactly those \(m\) such that there exists \(r\) with \(r^2 = 32 m\).

This description is the final formulated set.

In Lean, this is expressed as:
\[
\{ m : \mathbb{Z} \mid \exists r : \mathbb{Z}, r^2 = 32 m \}
\]

That is a fully robust characterization.

Your original error was the misuse of a quantifier inside a set-builder (placing \(\exists r : \mathbb{Z}\) after the main clause without proper form). Also, you had a syntax error because you wrote the existential quantifier after an equality without enclosing parentheses.

Hence, the corrected and fully Lean-compatible form is:

<<< { m : ℤ | ∃ r : ℤ, r ^ 2 = 32 * m } >>>

This set exactly corresponds to the values of \(m\) for which \(P(m)\) factors nontrivially over \(\mathbb{Z}\).
