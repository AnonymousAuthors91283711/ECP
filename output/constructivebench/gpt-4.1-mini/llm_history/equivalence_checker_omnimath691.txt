Ground Truth Answer: -2 ^ 1002
Proposed Answer: (2^(1002) - (-1)^1002) / 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recurrence relation:
   - a₁ = 1
   - a₂ = 0
   - aₙ₊₂ = 2aₙ + aₙ₊₁ for n ≥ 1

2. The ground truth answer is -2¹⁰⁰²

3. The proposed answer is (2¹⁰⁰² - (-1)¹⁰⁰²)/3

Let's evaluate the proposed answer:
- Since 1002 is even, (-1)^1002 = 1
- So the expression becomes (2¹⁰⁰² - 1)/3
- This is clearly different from -2¹⁰⁰²

The correct solution would involve solving the recurrence relation:
- Characteristic equation: r² - r - 2 = 0 → roots 2 and -1
- General solution: aₙ = A·2ⁿ + B·(-1)ⁿ
- Using initial conditions:
  a₁ = 2A - B = 1
  a₂ = 4A + B = 0
- Solving gives A = 1/6, B = -2/3
- Thus aₙ = (2ⁿ)/6 - (2·(-1)ⁿ)/3
- For n=2004: a₂₀₀₄ = (2²⁰⁰⁴)/6 - (2)/3 = (2²⁰⁰⁴ - 4)/6
- Simplified: (2²⁰⁰² - 1)/3

Neither the ground truth nor the proposed answer matches this correct solution. However, the proposed answer is closer to the correct form (though still incorrect), while the ground truth is completely different.
