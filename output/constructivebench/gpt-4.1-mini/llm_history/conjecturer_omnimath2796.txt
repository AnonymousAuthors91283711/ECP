The error comes from trying to assign a triple \((p, q, p^2 + q^2)\) of type \(\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}\) to a variable declared as a single real number. The problem asks for \(p, q : \mathbb{R}\) and a real number \(p^2 + q^2\) representing the sum of their squares; the answer expression should be just the value of \(p^2 + q^2\), a single real number.

Given the candidate \(p = 7 - 2 \sqrt{22}\) and \(q = 7 + 2 \sqrt{22}\), the sum of squares is

\[
p^2 + q^2 = (7 - 2\sqrt{22})^2 + (7 + 2\sqrt{22})^2.
\]

Expanding each:

\[
(7)^2 - 2 \cdot 7 \cdot 2 \sqrt{22} + (2\sqrt{22})^2 + (7)^2 + 2 \cdot 7 \cdot 2 \sqrt{22} + (2\sqrt{22})^2 = 2 \times 7^2 + 2 \times (2\sqrt{22})^2 = 2 \times 49 + 2 \times 4 \times 22 = 98 + 176 = 274.
\]

Thus \(p^2 + q^2 = 274\).

Therefore, the correct definition of the answer is just the number 274.

<<<274>>>
