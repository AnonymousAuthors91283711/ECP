noncomputable abbrev omnimath2819_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2819 (a b x : ℝ) (h : a + b = 12) :
  a * (x + 2) + b * (x + 2) = 60 ↔ x = omnimath2819_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: (60 / 12) - 2
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us the equation: a*(x+2) + b*(x+2) = 60 with the constraint a + b = 12
2. We can factor the left side: (a + b)*(x + 2) = 60
3. Substitute the constraint: 12*(x + 2) = 60
4. Solve for x: x + 2 = 60/12 → x + 2 = 5 → x = 3

The ground truth answer is (60/12) - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3
The proposed answer is 4, which is incorrect.
