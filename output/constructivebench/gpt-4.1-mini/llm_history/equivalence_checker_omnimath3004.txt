abbrev omnimath3004_answer : â„• := sorry
theorem omnimath3004 : 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = omnimath3004_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 10^2
Proposed Answer: (1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3)
Let's evaluate both answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer: 10^2 = 100
2. Proposed Answer: (1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3) = 1 + 8 + 27 + 64 = 100

The proposed answer is the expanded form of the calculation that results in the same value as the ground truth answer (100). While the forms are different, they are mathematically equivalent.
