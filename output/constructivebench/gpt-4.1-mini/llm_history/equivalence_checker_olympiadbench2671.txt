  IsLeast {b : ℕ | 1 < b ∧ Nat.Prime (1 * b + 6) ∧ ∃ k, k^2 = 9 * b + 7} olympiadbench2671_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 53
Proposed Answer: 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number b > 1 where:
   - 1*b + 6 is prime
   - There exists a k such that k² = 9*b + 7

2. Ground truth answer is 53
   - 1*53 + 6 = 59 (prime)
   - 9*53 + 7 = 484 = 22² (perfect square)

3. Proposed answer is 7
   - 1*7 + 6 = 13 (prime)
   - 9*7 + 7 = 70, which is not a perfect square

The proposed answer fails the second condition (70 isn't a perfect square), while the ground truth answer satisfies both conditions. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
