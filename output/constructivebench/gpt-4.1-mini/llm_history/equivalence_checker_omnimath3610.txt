Ground Truth Answer: {1, 3, 18, 36}
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | 1 < n ∧ (List.sum ((Nat.divisors n).toList.map (fun d => (Nat.divisors d).card))) = n}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer captures the main condition of summing the divisor counts of all divisors of n, but it differs from the ground truth in two ways:
1. It includes the condition 1 < n which isn't present in the ground truth (though 1 is in the ground truth set)
2. It doesn't sort the divisors first (though sorting might not affect the sum)
3. The ground truth specifically lists {1, 3, 18, 36} while the proposed answer is a set builder form

The core mathematical condition is essentially the same, but the exact sets differ slightly in their construction and inclusion of 1.
