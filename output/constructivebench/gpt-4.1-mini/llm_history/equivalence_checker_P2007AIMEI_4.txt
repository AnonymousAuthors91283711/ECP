Ground Truth Answer: 105
Proposed Answer: 60 * 7 * 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest positive integer n that is a common multiple of 60, 84, and 140. This is equivalent to finding the least common multiple (LCM) of these three numbers.

2. Ground Truth Answer: 105
   - This is incorrect. The LCM of 60, 84, and 140 is actually 420, not 105.

3. Proposed Answer: 60 * 7 * 2 = 840
   - This is also incorrect, but for a different reason. While the calculation 60*7*2=840 is correct, this is not the LCM of the three numbers.

The correct LCM calculation would be:
- Prime factors:
  - 60 = 2² × 3 × 5
  - 84 = 2² × 3 × 7
  - 140 = 2² × 5 × 7
- LCM = 2² × 3 × 5 × 7 = 420

Both answers are incorrect, but they are incorrect in different ways. Neither matches the correct solution of 420.
