Ground Truth Answer: (62, 2)
Proposed Answer: (55, 44)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find a unique pair of natural numbers (p₁, p₂) where:
   - Both numbers are positive (0 < p₁ ∧ 0 < p₂)
   - They satisfy the equation: (p₁ + p₂ - 1) * (p₁ + p₂) / 2 - p₁ + 1 = 2015

2. Ground Truth Answer: (62, 2)
   - Let's verify: p₁ + p₂ = 64
   - (64-1)*64/2 - 62 + 1 = 63*32 - 61 = 2016 - 61 = 1955 ≠ 2015
   Wait, this doesn't seem to satisfy the equation. There might be an error in the ground truth answer.

3. Proposed Answer: (55, 44)
   - p₁ + p₂ = 99
   - (99-1)*99/2 - 55 + 1 = 98*49.5 - 54 = 4851 - 54 = 4797 ≠ 2015
   This also doesn't satisfy the equation.

However, the problem states there exists a unique solution, and neither answer satisfies the equation. This suggests both answers are incorrect, but they're both equally wrong in terms of not satisfying the equation.

Given that neither answer satisfies the given equation, they are equivalent in their incorrectness.
