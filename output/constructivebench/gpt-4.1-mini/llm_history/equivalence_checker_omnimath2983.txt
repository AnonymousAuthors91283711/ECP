Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us the equation (1/3)*x = 4 and asks us to find the value of (1/6)*x.

2. Ground Truth Answer is 2:
   - From (1/3)*x = 4, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides by 3: x = 12
   - Then (1/6)*x = (1/6)*12 = 2

3. Proposed Answer is 8:
   - This would be correct if we were solving for x (since 3*4=12), but the question asks for (1/6)*x
   - 8 is actually the value of x/1.5 (since 12/1.5=8), not x/6

The proposed answer is incorrect as it gives a different value than what the problem asks for. The correct answer should be 2, not 8.
