Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 2, 3)}
Proposed Answer: { (a, b, c) : ℝ × ℝ × ℝ | b = a + 1 ∧ c = a + 2 ∧ a > 0 ∧ b > 1 ∧ c > 2 }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is a system of three equations with three variables (x, y, z) involving logarithmic functions.

2. The ground truth answer gives a specific solution (1, 2, 3).

3. The proposed answer gives a general solution set with constraints:
   - b = a + 1
   - c = a + 2
   - a > 0, b > 1, c > 2

Testing the ground truth solution in the proposed answer:
For (1, 2, 3):
- b = a + 1 → 2 = 1 + 1 ✓
- c = a + 2 → 3 = 1 + 2 ✓
- a > 0 → 1 > 0 ✓
- b > 1 → 2 > 1 ✓
- c > 2 → 3 > 2 ✓

However, the proposed answer claims ALL solutions satisfy these conditions, but we don't know if (1, 2, 3) is the unique solution. The logarithmic terms suggest the solution might be unique, but the proposed answer is more general.

The proposed answer is partially correct as it includes the ground truth, but may be too broad if the solution is unique. Therefore:
