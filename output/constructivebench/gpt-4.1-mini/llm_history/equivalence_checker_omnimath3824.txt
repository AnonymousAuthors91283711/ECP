Ground Truth Answer: fun a d n => (-1)^n * 2^(n-1) * d^n * (2 * a + n * d)
Proposed Answer: fun (a d : ℝ) (n : ℕ) => (a + n * d) * (a - d)^n
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. Ground truth: (-1)^n * 2^(n-1) * d^n * (2 * a + n * d)
2. Proposed: (a + n * d) * (a - d)^n

Let's test with concrete values to check equivalence:

Case n=1:
- Ground truth: (-1)^1 * 2^0 * d^1 * (2a + d) = -d(2a + d)
- Proposed: (a + d) * (a - d) = a² - d²
These are clearly different.

Case n=2:
- Ground truth: 1 * 2 * d² * (2a + 2d) = 4d²(a + d)
- Proposed: (a + 2d)(a - d)² = (a + 2d)(a² - 2ad + d²)
Again, different results.

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth in any case I tested. The forms are fundamentally different - the ground truth has alternating signs and powers of 2, while the proposed answer has a binomial expansion form.
