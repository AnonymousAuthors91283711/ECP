Ground Truth Answer: fun (m, n) => (2 * 2001 * m - m^2 - m * n) / n
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℤ × ℤ => 2 * p.1 + p.2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a set A of integer pairs (m,n) with certain conditions and asks for a function f that produces certain extremal values (3750 as greatest and 2 as least) when applied to elements of A.

2. The ground truth answer is a specific rational function of m and n that satisfies the given conditions.

3. The proposed answer is a much simpler linear function of m and n.

Key observations:
- The proposed answer doesn't match the complexity of the ground truth answer.
- The proposed answer doesn't incorporate the constant 2001 (a in the problem) that appears in the ground truth answer.
- The proposed answer is unlikely to satisfy both the greatest and least value conditions simultaneously with such a simple form.

The answers are clearly different in form and almost certainly produce different results. The proposed answer doesn't appear to satisfy the problem's requirements.
