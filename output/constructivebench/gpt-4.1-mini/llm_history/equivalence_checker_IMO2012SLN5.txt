Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ (a m : ℕ), ∀ (n : ℕ), f n = a * n ^ m}
Proposed Answer: { f | ∃ (c k : ℕ), (∀ n, f n = c * n ^ k) ∧ c > 0 }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but adds an extra constraint (c > 0) that isn't present in the ground truth answer. The ground truth allows for a=0 (which would make f(n)=0 for all n), while the proposed answer excludes this case. The core structure (f(n) = constant * n^power) is correct in both.
