Ground Truth Answer: 2046264
Proposed Answer: 2023 * 4046
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal sum ∑a_i where a_i are positive integers satisfying a recursive condition involving absolute differences.

2. The ground truth answer is 2,046,264.

3. The proposed answer is 2023 * 4046 = 2023 * (2*2023) = 2023² * 2 = 4,092,529 * 2 = 8,185,058.

4. Clearly, 8,185,058 ≠ 2,046,264.

5. The proposed answer is actually much larger than the ground truth answer.

6. The proposed answer seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the problem's constraints or an incorrect pattern recognition.
