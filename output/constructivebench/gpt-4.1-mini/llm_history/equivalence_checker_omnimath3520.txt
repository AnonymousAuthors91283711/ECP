Ground Truth Answer: 5
Proposed Answer: 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a number x in {1,...,11} such that:
   - When x is removed, the average of the remaining numbers is 6.1
   - This x is unique (no other number satisfies this condition)

2. Calculation:
   - Total sum of {1,...,11} = 66
   - For average of remaining 10 numbers to be 6.1: sum of remaining = 61
   - Therefore, the removed number must be 66 - 61 = 5

3. Verification:
   - Ground truth answer is 5 (correct)
   - Proposed answer is 7 (incorrect)
   - If we remove 7: sum remaining = 66-7 = 59, average = 59/10 = 5.9 ≠ 6.1
