The errors arise because Lean expects a `Set (ℕ × ℕ)` to be defined via a predicate on a single variable of type `ℕ × ℕ`, but the current notation uses `(n,m)` with implicit binders inside a set comprehension, so these variables are not recognized. Also, the exponentiation and inequalities must be applied carefully to natural numbers, with explicit unpacking of the pair.

To fix this, define `omnimath2254_answer` as the set of pairs `p : ℕ × ℕ` such that the first component is positive, the second component is positive, and the sum of their squares is 9364. We can write this using a lambda expression on `p`.

Using pattern matching in `λ p => ...` notation, write:

```lean
{p : ℕ × ℕ | p.1 > 0 ∧ p.2 > 0 ∧ p.1 ^ 2 + p.2 ^ 2 = 9364}
```

This is valid syntax for a `Set (ℕ × ℕ)`.

We trust this matches the intent of the problem: the set of positive integer pairs whose squares sum to 9364.

<<<{p : ℕ × ℕ | p.1 > 0 ∧ p.2 > 0 ∧ p.1 ^ 2 + p.2 ^ 2 = 9364}>>>
