Ground Truth Answer: 77
Proposed Answer: 105
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a condition: k > 0 and k(k+1)(k+2) = 8*(3k+3)
2. Simplifying the equation: k(k+1)(k+2) = 24(k+1)
3. For k > 0, we can divide both sides by (k+1): k(k+2) = 24
4. This becomes k² + 2k - 24 = 0
5. Solving the quadratic equation: k = (-2 ± √(4+96))/2 = (-2 ± 10)/2
6. The positive solution is k = 4

Now calculate k² + (k+1)² + (k+2)² for k=4:
4² + 5² + 6² = 16 + 25 + 36 = 77

The ground truth answer is 77, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 105, which is incorrect.
