theorem omnimath3269 (p q : Polynomial ℝ) :
    (∀ x : ℝ, eval x (p * q.comp (X + 1) - p.comp (X + 1) * q) = 1) ↔ (p, q) ∈ omnimath3269_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (Polynomial ℝ × Polynomial ℝ)
<<<{(p, q) | ∃ a b c : ℝ, p = C a ∧ q = C b ∧ a * b = 0 ∧ ∀ x, eval x (p * q.comp (X + 1) - p.comp (X + 1) * q) = 1}>>>
