Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: (0 : ℝ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two expressions G and G' defined in terms of x and y, with constraints -1 < x < y < 1.
2. We're told G = G', which leads to the equation x/(1-y) = y/(1-x).
3. Cross-multiplying gives: x(1-x) = y(1-y) => x - x² = y - y² => x - y = x² - y² => x - y = (x-y)(x+y)
4. Since x ≠ y (because x < y), we can divide both sides by (x-y) to get: 1 = x + y

The ground truth answer is 1, which matches our derivation. The proposed answer is 0, which contradicts our derivation.
