Ground Truth Answer: (5/4, 1/2, 1/4)
Proposed Answer: (2, 0, 0)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a system of 3 equations with 3 variables (p, q, r):
   - p + 3q + r = 3
   - p + 2q + 3r = 3
   - p + q + r = 2

2. The ground truth answer (5/4, 1/2, 1/4) satisfies all three equations:
   - 5/4 + 3*(1/2) + 1/4 = 5/4 + 3/2 + 1/4 = 3
   - 5/4 + 2*(1/2) + 3*(1/4) = 5/4 + 1 + 3/4 = 3
   - 5/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 2

3. The proposed answer (2, 0, 0) only satisfies the third equation:
   - 2 + 3*0 + 0 = 2 ≠ 3 (fails first equation)
   - 2 + 2*0 + 3*0 = 2 ≠ 3 (fails second equation)
   - 2 + 0 + 0 = 2 (only this one is correct)

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy all equations of the system, while the ground truth does. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
