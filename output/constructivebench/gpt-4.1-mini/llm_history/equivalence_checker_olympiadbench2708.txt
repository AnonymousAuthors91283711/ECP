Ground Truth Answer: 12
Proposed Answer: 441
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal positive integer y such that 1584x divides xy, where x is the minimal positive integer making 1584x a perfect cube.

2. First, we factorize 1584 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 11

3. For 1584x to be a perfect cube, x must be 2^2 * 3 * 11^2 = 1452 (to make all exponents multiples of 3)

4. Now we need the minimal y such that 1584*1452 divides 1452*y, which simplifies to 1584 divides y

5. The minimal positive y satisfying this is 1584/132 = 12 (since 1452 = 132*11 and we can cancel the 132)

The ground truth answer is 12, which is correct. The proposed answer is 441, which doesn't satisfy the conditions (1584 doesn't divide 441).
