Ground Truth Answer: {(5, -3, 2, 3)}
Proposed Answer: {(7, -4, 3, 1)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a set of 4-tuples (a,b,c,d) that must satisfy three equations:
   - a² - b² - c² - d² = c - b - 2
   - 2ab = a - d - 32
   - 2ac = 28 - a - d
   - 2ad = b + c + 31

2. Ground truth answer is {(5, -3, 2, 3)}
   - Checking: 
     (5)² - (-3)² - (2)² - (3)² = 25-9-4-9 = 3 = 2-(-3)-2 = 3 ✔
     2*5*(-3) = -30 = 5-3-32 = -30 ✔
     2*5*2 = 20 = 28-5-3 = 20 ✔
     2*5*3 = 30 = -3+2+31 = 30 ✔

3. Proposed answer is {(7, -4, 3, 1)}
   - Checking:
     (7)² - (-4)² - (3)² - (1)² = 49-16-9-1 = 23 ≠ 3-(-4)-2 = 5 ✗
     (The first equation already fails)

The proposed solution doesn't satisfy the given equations, while the ground truth does.
