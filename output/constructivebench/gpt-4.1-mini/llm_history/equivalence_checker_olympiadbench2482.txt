Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

The equation is: 3^(x+2) + 2^(x+2) + 2^x = 2^(x+5) + 3^x

We can simplify both sides:
Left side: 9*3^x + 4*2^x + 2^x = 9*3^x + 5*2^x
Right side: 32*2^x + 3^x

So the equation becomes: 9*3^x + 5*2^x = 32*2^x + 3^x
Which simplifies to: 8*3^x = 27*2^x
Or: (3^x)/(2^x) = 27/8
Which is: (3/2)^x = (3/2)^3

Therefore, x must be 3.

The ground truth answer is 3, while the proposed answer is 1. Testing x=1:
Left side: 9*3 + 5*2 = 27 + 10 = 37
Right side: 32*2 + 3 = 64 + 3 = 67
37 ≠ 67, so x=1 is not a solution.
