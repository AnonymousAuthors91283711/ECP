Ground Truth Answer: 3125
Proposed Answer: 1482
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a 4-digit number (since it has digits a,b,c,d with a≠0) where:
   - All digits are distinct
   - The equation (10a+b)^c * (100a+10c+d) = concatenated number (formed as abacacd) holds

2. Ground Truth Answer is 3125:
   - Digits: a=3, b=1, c=2, d=5
   - Check: (31)^2 * (325) = 961 * 325 = 312,325 which matches 312325 (abacacd format)

3. Proposed Answer is 1482:
   - Digits: a=1, b=4, c=8, d=2
   - Check: (14)^8 * (182) = 14^8 is already 147,578,905,600 which is way larger than the required 6-digit number (1418182)

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the equation, while the ground truth does. They are not equivalent.
