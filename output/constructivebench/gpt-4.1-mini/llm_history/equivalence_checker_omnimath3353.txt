Ground Truth Answer: 4036082 / 4036081
Proposed Answer: 2 * Complex.exp (-Real.log 2009 * Complex.I)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

The problem involves complex trigonometric functions and logarithms. We need to evaluate the expression:
2 * cos(ln(2009)*i)² + i * sin(ln(4036081)*i)

Key observations:
1. 4036081 = 2009², so ln(4036081) = 2*ln(2009)
2. Using Euler's formula and properties of hyperbolic functions:
   - cos(ix) = cosh(x)
   - sin(ix) = i*sinh(x)
   - cosh(x) = (eˣ + e⁻ˣ)/2
   - sinh(x) = (eˣ - e⁻ˣ)/2

Let's evaluate the ground truth answer:
4036082/4036081 = (4036081 + 1)/4036081 = 1 + 1/4036081 ≈ 1 + very small term

Now evaluate the proposed answer:
2 * exp(-ln(2009)*i) = 2 * (1/2009^i) = 2 * 2009⁻ⁱ

This doesn't match the ground truth answer in form or value. The proposed answer is missing the main constant term and the trigonometric structure of the original expression.

The correct evaluation should lead to:
2cosh(ln(2009))² - sinh(2ln(2009)) = 1 + 1/4036081

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
