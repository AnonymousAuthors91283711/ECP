Ground Truth Answer: 30
Proposed Answer: 11
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n > 10 where (2^n + n^2) mod 10 equals (2^10 + 10^2) mod 10.

2. First calculate (2^10 + 10^2) mod 10:
   - 2^10 = 1024 → 1024 mod 10 = 4
   - 10^2 = 100 → 100 mod 10 = 0
   - So we're looking for n where (2^n + n^2) mod 10 = 4

3. Check the proposed answer (11):
   - 2^11 = 2048 → 2048 mod 10 = 8
   - 11^2 = 121 → 121 mod 10 = 1
   - 8 + 1 = 9 mod 10 ≠ 4 → Doesn't satisfy the condition

4. Check the ground truth answer (30):
   - 2^30 mod 10 cycles every 4: 2^4 ≡6, 2^8≡6, etc. → 2^30 ≡ (2^4)^7 * 2^2 ≡ 6*4 ≡4
   - 30^2 = 900 → 900 mod 10 = 0
   - 4 + 0 = 4 mod 10 → Satisfies the condition

The proposed answer (11) doesn't satisfy the condition, while the ground truth answer (30) does. They are not equivalent.
