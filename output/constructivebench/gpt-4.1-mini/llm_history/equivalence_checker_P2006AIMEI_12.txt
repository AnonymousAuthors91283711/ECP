Ground Truth Answer: 906
Proposed Answer: Finset.sum (Finset.range 3) (fun i => 120 + 20 * i)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem asks for a set of real numbers x between 100 and 200 that satisfy a trigonometric equation, and then wants the sum of these solutions.

2. The ground truth answer is 906.

3. The proposed answer suggests summing the numbers 120, 140, and 160 (which comes from 120 + 20*i for i=0,1,2).

Calculating the proposed sum:
120 + 140 + 160 = 420

This does not match the ground truth answer of 906. Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
