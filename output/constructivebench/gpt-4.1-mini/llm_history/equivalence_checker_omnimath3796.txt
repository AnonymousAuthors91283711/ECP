abbrev omnimath3796_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3796 :

Ground Truth Answer: {3}
Proposed Answer: {p | Nat.Prime p ∧ (∃! a : ZMod p, a^3 - 3*a + 1 = 0)}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both are expressing the same set of natural numbers \( p \) that are prime and have exactly one solution \( a \) in \( \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} \) to the equation \( a^3 - 3a + 1 = 0 \). The ground truth answer explicitly states the set \( \{3\} \), while the proposed answer describes the set using the same conditions. The notation and logic are identical, just presented differently.
