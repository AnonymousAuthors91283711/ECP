Ground Truth Answer: 11
Proposed Answer: 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves a 3x3 matrix with specific values and asks to find natural numbers a and b such that:
   - The matrix can be expressed as row_ops[i] + 2*col_ops[j] for all i,j
   - The sums of row_ops and col_ops are a and b respectively
   - a + b should be minimized (implied by the problem structure)

2. The ground truth answer is 11, which suggests an optimal decomposition where a + b = 11.

3. The proposed answer is 7, which would require a more efficient decomposition than what's likely possible given the matrix values.

4. Looking at the matrix values, particularly the minimum value (1 in position (0,1)) and maximum value (9 in position (1,0))), it's unlikely we can achieve a + b = 7 while satisfying all the constraints.
