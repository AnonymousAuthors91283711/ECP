Ground Truth Answer: 7/6
Proposed Answer: 3/2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes two scenarios:
   - Joe starts with 12 units, drinks 2, then adds 2 (all cream)
   - JoAnn starts with 12 units, adds 2 (mixed), then drinks 2 of the mixture

2. For Joe:
   - Final cream = joeAdd = 2

3. For JoAnn:
   - After adding: total = 12 + 2 = 14
   - Fraction of cream in mixture: 12/14 = 6/7
   - When drinking 2: cream removed = 2 * (6/7) = 12/7
   - Final cream = initial (12) + added (2) - drunk (12/7) = 14 - 12/7 = (98-12)/7 = 86/7

4. Ratio calculation:
   - joeFinalCream / joAnnFinalCream = 2 / (86/7) = 14/86 = 7/43

Wait, this contradicts both answers. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

Ah, I see the confusion - the ground truth answer is given as 7/6, but based on the problem statement as written, the correct answer should be:

For JoAnn:
- Final cream is defined as joAnnAdd * (joAnnInitial / (joAnnInitial + joAnnAdd)) = 2 * (12/14) = 12/7
- Joe's final cream is 2
- Ratio is 2 / (12/7) = 14/12 = 7/6

The proposed answer 3/2 is incorrect. The ground truth answer 7/6 matches the calculation based on the given problem statement.
