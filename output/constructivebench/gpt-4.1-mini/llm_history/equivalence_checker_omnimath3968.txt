theorem omnimath3968 :
  {(x, p) : ℕ × ℕ | x > 0 ∧ p > 0 ∧ p.Prime ∧ x ≤ 2 * p ∧ (x ^ (p - 1) ∣ (p - 1) ^ x + 1)} = omnimath3968_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 2), (3, 3)} ∪ {(1, p) | p : ℕ, p.Prime}
Proposed Answer: {(x, p) | p.Prime ∧ (x = 1 ∨ (p = 2 ∧ x ∈ ({1, 2, 3, 4} : Set ℕ)))}
Let me analyze the problem and compare the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all pairs (x,p) where:
   - x > 0, p > 0
   - p is prime
   - x ≤ 2*p
   - x^(p-1) divides (p-1)^x + 1

2. Ground Truth Answer:
   - All pairs (1,p) where p is prime
   - Plus the specific pairs (2,2) and (3,3)

3. Proposed Answer:
   - All pairs (1,p) where p is prime
   - Plus all pairs (x,2) where x ∈ {1,2,3,4}

Comparison:
- The proposed answer correctly includes all (1,p) cases
- However, it incorrectly includes (4,2) which doesn't satisfy the original condition (4^1 doesn't divide 1^4 + 1 = 2)
- It misses the (3,3) case which does satisfy the condition (3^2 divides 2^3 + 1 = 9)
- It incorrectly includes (3,2) which doesn't satisfy the condition (3^1 doesn't divide 1^3 + 1 = 2)

The proposed answer is partially correct but has several inaccuracies.
