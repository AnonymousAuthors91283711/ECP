Ground Truth Answer: fun a => (2 * a + 5) / 5
Proposed Answer: fun a => if a = -5 then 1 else 2 + a
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a condition on c (in terms of a) that makes the system of equations solvable for all b.

2. The system:
   - a*x + b*y = c-1
   - (a+5)*x + (b+3)*y = c+1

3. For the system to have solutions for all b, the determinant condition must be satisfied.

4. Calculating the determinant:
   det = a*(b+3) - b*(a+5) = 3a - 5b

5. For the system to have solutions for all b, the determinant must be non-zero for all b, which is impossible since it's linear in b. Therefore, the only possibility is that both equations are proportional.

6. Setting the coefficients proportional:
   a/(a+5) = b/(b+3) = (c-1)/(c+1)

7. From a/(a+5) = b/(b+3), we get ab + 3a = ab + 5b ⇒ 3a = 5b ⇒ b = (3/5)a

8. Substituting b = (3/5)a into the proportion:
   a/(a+5) = (c-1)/(c+1)
   ⇒ a(c+1) = (a+5)(c-1)
   ⇒ ac + a = ac - a + 5c - 5
   ⇒ 2a + 5 = 5c
   ⇒ c = (2a + 5)/5

The ground truth answer matches this derivation exactly. The proposed answer gives a piecewise function that only matches when a ≠ -5, and incorrectly handles the a = -5 case (where the system would actually be inconsistent unless c = -1, not 1).
