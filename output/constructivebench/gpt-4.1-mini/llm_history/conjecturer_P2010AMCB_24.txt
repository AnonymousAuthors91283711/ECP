The issue arises because Real.sqrt and operations on reals with sqrt are noncomputable in Lean, so to make Lean accept the definition, we should mark it as noncomputable. Also, the given sum is simplifying the length of the union of intervals, which can be cleaned algebraically to a nicer form to match the problem.

Given intervals lengths are:

I1 length = (1 - sqrt 2) - (-1) = 1 - sqrt 2 + 1 = 2 - sqrt 2

I2 length = (1/2) - 0 = 1/2

I3 length = (1 + sqrt 2) - 1 = sqrt 2

Sum total length = (2 - sqrt 2) + 1/2 + sqrt 2 = 2 + 1/2 = 2.5 or 5/2

So total length = 5 / 2

Hence a simplified exact value is 5/2.

To implement in Lean, mark the answer as noncomputable and define:

noncomputable abbrev P2010AMCB_24_answer : ℝ := 5/2

Alternatively, if the problem anticipates exact sum of intervals lengths, the final closed form is 5/2.

The error arises because `abbrev` expects a term directly and cannot be followed by a `def` or `noncomputable def`. Additionally, the answer can just be the numeric value since the sum of lengths of the intervals simplifies nicely.

Interval lengths sum:

(1 - √2) - (-1) = 1 - √2 + 1 = 2 - √2  
(1/2) - 0 = 1/2  
(1 + √2) - 1 = √2  

Sum = (2 - √2) + (1/2) + (√2) = 2 + 1/2 = 5/2

So the answer is `5 / 2` just as you gave, but numerical division should be written as `5 / 2` but using notation `5 / 2 : ℝ`. We must be explicit with the real literals to avoid integer division.

Hence, the correct `abbrev` definition is:

The problem asks to find a real number equal to the sum of the lengths of three intervals, related to the set S where f(x) > 1 for some rational function f. The intervals are:

I1 = (-1, 1 - √2)
I2 = (0, 1/2)
I3 = (1, 1 + √2)

We want the sum of the lengths:

length(I1) = (1 - √2) - (-1) = 2 - √2
length(I2) = 1/2 - 0 = 1/2
length(I3) = (1 + √2) - 1 = √2

Sum = (2 - √2) + 1/2 + √2 = 2 + 1/2 = 5/2

That matches the enumerated answer 5 / 2, but the Lean error says that `5/2` is problematic because Lean needs 'noncomputable' to handle reals involving division.

To fix this, we can mark the abbreviation as noncomputable, which is typical in Lean when working with real numbers with divisions and square roots.

So the fix is:

noncomputable abbrev P2010AMCB_24_answer : ℝ := 5 / 2

Hence the fixed expression is:

The error arises because `noncomputable` is a command and cannot be used as a term or value. Also, the numeric literal should be written as `5 / 2` or better as `5 / 2 : ℝ` with coercion or division in reals.

The problem states the sum of lengths of intervals is (1 - √2 - (-1)) + (1/2 - 0) + (1 + √2 - 1), which simplifies algebraically to:

(1 - √2 + 1) + (1/2) + (√2) = (2 - √2) + (1/2) + (√2) = 2 + 1/2 = 5/2.

So the answer is exactly 5/2 but as a real number.

Hence, the correct Lean expression is just: `5 / 2` but we should make sure it is understood as a real, so write `(5 : ℝ) / 2`.

<<<(5 : ℝ) / 2>>>
