Ground Truth Answer: 10
Proposed Answer: 696
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal value s where:
   - We have two arithmetic sequences a and b with constant differences da and db
   - The sequences never intersect (a_i ≠ b_j for any i,j)
   - a₂₀ + b₁₄ = 1000
   - b₂₀ + a₁₄ = s
   - We need to find the minimal possible s

2. The ground truth answer is 10, which suggests that under optimal conditions, the minimal s achievable is 10.

3. The proposed answer is 696, which is significantly larger than 10.

4. To verify, let's consider the constraints:
   - The sequences must be disjoint arithmetic sequences
   - The equations a₂₀ + b₁₄ = 1000 and b₂₀ + a₁₄ = s must hold
   - The minimal s would occur when the sequences are as close as possible without intersecting

5. The large discrepancy between 10 and 696 suggests the proposed answer is incorrect. The minimal s should be much smaller, as indicated by the ground truth.
