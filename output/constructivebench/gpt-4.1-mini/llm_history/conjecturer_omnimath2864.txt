The error is because Lean's `8 / 0.4` involves real division which depends on some noncomputable instances. Marking the answer as `noncomputable` or using `8 / (2 / 5)` (since 0.4 = 2/5) expressed as real division might help. Alternatively, rewrite `8 / 0.4` as `8 * (5/2)` to avoid the division on a real literal.

Explanation: By the problem data, length - hiked = 8, and hiked = 0.6 * length, so length - 0.6 * length = 8 → 0.4 * length = 8 → length = 8 / 0.4. To make it acceptable in Lean, rewrite 0.4 as rational to avoid division on a floating literal.

The problem states that hiked = 0.6 * length and length - hiked = 8. From these, we have:

length - 0.6 * length = 8  
0.4 * length = 8  
length = 8 / 0.4 = 20

So the length is 20. The given candidate answer "8 * (5 / 2)" equals 20 but the syntax used is incorrect for Lean.

In Lean, division like "5 / 2" for real numbers must be written with decimals or rational literals explicitly provided as real numbers. So "5 / 2" can be written as "5 / 2" but both 5 and 2 should be coerced to ℝ explicitly or the division should be done using real literals like 5.0 / 2.0.

Also, "abbrev" expects a term, not the keyword "noncomputable def". So replace "abbrev" by "noncomputable def" or define "abbrev omnimath2864_answer : ℝ := 8 * (5 / 2 : ℝ)".

Therefore, the fixed answer is:

The error occurs because Lean requires noncomputable to handle real number division and other non-executable entities. So marking the definition as noncomputable will fix the issue.

Explanation:  
Given hiked = 0.6 * length and length - hiked = 8, we get length - 0.6 * length = 8 ⇒ 0.4 * length = 8 ⇒ length = 8 / 0.4 = 20. The answer 8 * (5 / 2) = 8 * 2.5 = 20 is correct, but Lean needs the noncomputable keyword to accept this real number definition.
