theorem omnimath2954 : 
  ∃! (p : ℕ × ℕ), 0 < p.1 ∧ p.1 ≤ p.2 ∧ p.1 * p.2 = 24 ∧ p.1 + p.2 = 11 ∧ p.2 - p.1 = omnimath2954_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 5
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a unique pair (p₁, p₂) where:
   - 0 < p₁ ≤ p₂
   - p₁ * p₂ = 24
   - p₁ + p₂ = 11
   - p₂ - p₁ = answer

2. Let's find the pair:
   - We need two numbers whose product is 24 and sum is 11
   - The pairs with product 24: (1,24), (2,12), (3,8), (4,6)
   - The pair that sums to 11 is (3,8)

3. Now calculate p₂ - p₁:
   - For (3,8): 8 - 3 = 5

4. The ground truth answer is 5, which is correct
5. The proposed answer is 4, which is incorrect as it should be 5

<<<False>>>
