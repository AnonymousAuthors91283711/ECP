    d = 6 ∧

Ground Truth Answer: 26
Proposed Answer: 18
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. From the theorem statement, we have:
   - d = 6 (given)
   - d + gd = 30 ⇒ gd = 24
   - gd = 6 * x ⇒ 24 = 6x ⇒ x = 4
   - x ≤ d ⇒ 4 ≤ 6 (which holds)
   - Final expression: d + (gd - x) = 6 + (24 - 4) = 6 + 20 = 26

The ground truth answer correctly follows this calculation to get 26. The proposed answer of 18 doesn't match this calculation. There's no domain or constraint where 18 would be correct based on the given conditions.
