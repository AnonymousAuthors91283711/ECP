Ground Truth Answer: fun T => (T + 1) * T^4 - (T + 1) * T - (T + 1) * choose T 2 * (2 * T^3 - 3 * T^2 + T)
Proposed Answer: fun T : ℕ => (T + 1) * (T^4 - T * (T - 1)^3)
Let's analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

1. First, let's expand the ground truth answer:
   - (T+1)*T^4 - (T+1)*T - (T+1)*choose(T,2)*(2*T^3-3*T^2+T)
   - = (T+1)[T^4 - T - T(T-1)/2 * (2T^3-3T^2+T)]
   - = (T+1)[T^4 - T - (T^2-T)/2 * (2T^3-3T^2+T)]

2. Now let's expand the proposed answer:
   - (T+1)*(T^4 - T*(T-1)^3)
   - = (T+1)*(T^4 - T*(T^3-3T^2+3T-1))
   - = (T+1)*(T^4 - T^4 + 3T^3 - 3T^2 + T)
   - = (T+1)*(3T^3 - 3T^2 + T)

3. Comparing the two:
   The ground truth answer has a more complex expression involving choose(T,2) and higher degree terms, while the proposed answer simplifies to a cubic polynomial. These are clearly not equivalent.

For example, let's test with T=2:
- Ground truth: 3*16 - 3*2 - 3*1*(16-12+2) = 48-6-18 = 24
- Proposed: 3*(24-12+2) = 3*14 = 42
The results differ (24 ≠ 42), confirming they're not equivalent.
