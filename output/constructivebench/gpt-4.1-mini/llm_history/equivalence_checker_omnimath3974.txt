Ground Truth Answer: { f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, f = fun x => c * x }
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ x : ℝ, f x = c * x}
<<<True>>>
The ground truth answer and the proposed answer are equivalent. Both describe the set of all linear functions of the form f(x) = c*x where c is a real constant. The ground truth uses function equality (f = fun x => c * x) while the proposed answer uses pointwise equality (∀ x : ℝ, f x = c * x), but these formulations are mathematically equivalent in this context. Both correctly characterize the solution to the given functional equation.
