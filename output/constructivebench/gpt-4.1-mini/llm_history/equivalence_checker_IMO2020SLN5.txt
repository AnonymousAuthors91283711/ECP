theorem IMO2020SLN5 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∃ n, f n ≠ 0) ∧
  (∀ x y, f (x * y) = f x + f y) ∧

Ground Truth Answer: fun p c n => c * (padicValNat p n)
Proposed Answer: fun p c n => c * (n / p)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a function f with three properties:
   - Non-zero for some n
   - Multiplicative property: f(x*y) = f(x) + f(y)
   - Infinite set condition about symmetry

2. The ground truth answer uses padicValNat, which counts the exponent of prime p in n's factorization. This correctly satisfies all properties:
   - Non-zero when p divides n
   - Multiplicative by properties of exponents
   - Symmetry condition holds for infinitely many n (powers of p)

3. The proposed answer uses n/p (integer division), which:
   - Is non-zero for n ≥ p
   - Fails the multiplicative property: e.g., p=2, c=1, x=2, y=2:
     f(4)=2 but f(2)+f(2)=1+1=2 (works here)
     But for x=4, y=4: f(16)=8 but f(4)+f(4)=4+4=8 (still works)
     However, for x=2, y=3: f(6)=3 but f(2)+f(3)=1+1=2 (fails)
   - The symmetry condition also fails for non-multiples of p
