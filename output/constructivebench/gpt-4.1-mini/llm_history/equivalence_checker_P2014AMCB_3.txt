  0 < x ∧ x / 3 + 20 + x / 5 = x ↔ x = P2014AMCB_3_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 40
Proposed Answer: 15
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us the equation: x/3 + 20 + x/5 = x with the constraint x > 0
2. Let's solve it step by step:
   - Combine like terms: x/3 + x/5 + 20 = x
   - Find common denominator (15): (5x + 3x)/15 + 20 = x
   - Simplify: 8x/15 + 20 = x
   - Subtract 8x/15 from both sides: 20 = x - 8x/15 = 7x/15
   - Solve for x: x = 20 * 15/7 = 300/7 ≈ 42.857

Wait, this contradicts both the ground truth (40) and proposed answer (15). However, the ground truth answer is given as 40, which is incorrect based on this calculation. The proposed answer of 15 is also incorrect.

But looking back at the original equation, perhaps there's a different interpretation. Maybe it's (x/3 + 20 + x)/5 = x? That would give:
- x/3 + 20 + x = 5x
- 4x/3 + 20 = 5x
- 20 = 5x - 4x/3 = 11x/3
- x = 60/11 ≈ 5.4545

This still doesn't match either answer. 

Given that neither the ground truth nor the proposed answer matches our calculations, but the ground truth is stated as the official answer, we should consider that the proposed answer (15) is incorrect.
