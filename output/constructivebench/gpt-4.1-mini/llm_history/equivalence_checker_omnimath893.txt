Ground Truth Answer: 1024
Proposed Answer: 2 ^ 10
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer \(2^{10}\) is indeed equal to 1024, which matches the ground truth answer. 

Moreover, the sum of binomial coefficients \(\sum_{i=0}^{10} \binom{10}{i}\) is known to be \(2^{10}\) by the binomial theorem, since:
\[
\sum_{i=0}^n \binom{n}{i} = 2^n.
\]
Here, \(n = 10\), so the sum is \(2^{10} = 1024\). Thus, the answers are equivalent.
