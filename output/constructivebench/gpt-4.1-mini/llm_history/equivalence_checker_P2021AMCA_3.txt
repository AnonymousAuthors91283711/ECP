theorem P2021AMCA_3 :
  ∃ (a b : ℕ), a + b = 17402 ∧ 10 ∣ a ∧ b = a / 10 ∧ a - b = P2021AMCA_3_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 14238
Proposed Answer: 13002
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find natural numbers a and b such that:
   - a + b = 17402
   - 10 divides a (10 ∣ a)
   - b = a / 10
   - a - b equals the answer (P2021AMCA_3_answer)

2. From the conditions:
   - Since b = a/10 and a is divisible by 10, we can write a = 10k, b = k for some natural k
   - Then a + b = 10k + k = 11k = 17402 ⇒ k = 17402/11 = 1582
   - Therefore:
     a = 10*1582 = 15820
     b = 1582
     a - b = 15820 - 1582 = 14238

3. The ground truth answer is 14238, which matches our calculation.

4. The proposed answer is 13002, which doesn't match our calculation.
