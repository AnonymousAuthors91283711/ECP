Ground Truth Answer: 14
Proposed Answer: 809
Let's analyze the proposed answer (809) against the ground truth answer (14) and the problem's conditions:

1. Check 809 % 3 ≠ 0: 8+0+9=17, 17%3=2 ≠ 0 ✔️
2. Check ¬IsSquare 809: 28²=784, 29²=841 → 809 isn't a square ✔️
3. Check prime digit sum: 8+0+9=17 (prime) ✔️

Now check ground truth (14):
1. 14%3=2 ≠ 0 ✔️
2. ¬IsSquare 14 ✔️
3. Digit sum 1+4=5 (prime) ✔️

Both answers satisfy all conditions, but they're different numbers. The problem appears to have multiple valid solutions (809 and 14 both work).
