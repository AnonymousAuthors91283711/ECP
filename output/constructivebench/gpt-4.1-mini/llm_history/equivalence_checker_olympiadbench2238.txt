Ground Truth Answer: {-1, 0, 1}
Proposed Answer: {x : ℤ | x^2 < 3}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer {x : ℤ | x^2 < 3} is mostly correct but not exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer {-1, 0, 1}. 

The inequality (x² - 3)(x² + 5) < 0 is satisfied when:
1. x² - 3 < 0 (since x² + 5 is always positive)
2. Which simplifies to x² < 3

For integer solutions, this gives x ∈ {-1, 0, 1}, which matches the ground truth. However, the proposed answer is expressed as a condition (x² < 3) rather than explicitly listing the solutions. While mathematically equivalent in terms of the solution set, the forms are different - one is an explicit enumeration while the other is a condition. 

Therefore, the answers are close but not identical in form.
