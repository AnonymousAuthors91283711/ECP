abbrev omnimath2669_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2669 (x : ℕ) : 
  x^2 + 2*x - x*(x + 1) = omnimath2669_answer x := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => x
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℕ => x
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to simplify the expression x² + 2x - x(x + 1)
2. Let's simplify it step by step:
   - x² + 2x - x(x + 1)
   = x² + 2x - x² - x  [expanding the multiplication]
   = (x² - x²) + (2x - x)
   = 0 + x
   = x

3. The ground truth answer is the identity function `fun x => x`
4. The proposed answer is `fun x : ℕ => x`, which is exactly the same as the ground truth answer, just with an explicit type annotation for x

The two answers are mathematically equivalent, with the only difference being the explicit type specification in the proposed answer, which doesn't affect the mathematical meaning.
