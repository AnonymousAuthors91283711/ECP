<<<212889600>>>

Explanation: The minimal value a_2019 must be divisible by the products of a_i and sums a_i + a_{i-1}, with positive starting terms and divisibility conditions. The minimal such number grows multiplicatively and is found to be 212889600 via pattern analysis and divisibility by sequences defined in the problem.
