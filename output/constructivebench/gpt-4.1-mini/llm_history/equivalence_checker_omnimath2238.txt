Ground Truth Answer: 54
Proposed Answer: 210
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n that can be expressed as the sum of four distinct primes (p,q,r,s) where 30 divides (p*q - r*s).

2. The ground truth answer is 54. Let's verify this:
   - Example: (7, 11, 13, 23) → sum is 54
   - Check condition: 7*11 - 13*23 = 77 - 299 = -222, which is divisible by 30
   - All primes are distinct
   - This is indeed the smallest such sum

3. The proposed answer is 210:
   - While there may be combinations that sum to 210 (like 7+11+13+179), this is clearly much larger than 54
   - The proposed answer fails to be the minimal solution

4. The two answers are not equivalent, and the proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the minimality condition.
