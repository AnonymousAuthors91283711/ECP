The error arises because Lean's real division requires marking the definition as noncomputable due to reliance on real number division that doesn't have executable code in Lean's logic framework directly.

The problem defines points P = 3 and V = 33, with 6 parts between them, and step = (V - P) / (parts + 1). Then points Q through U are defined as consecutive increments by step. The expression (S - P) + (V - T) evaluates to what?

We have parts = 6, so parts +1 =7. Steps = (33-3)/7 = 30/7.

S = R + step = Q + 2*step + step = P + 4*step (since Q = P+step, R = Q+step, S = R+step)

Similarly, T = S + step = P + 5*step

So:

(S - P) + (V - T) = (4*step) + (33 - (3 + 5*step)) = 4*step + (30 - 5*step) = (4*step - 5*step) + 30 = (-step) + 30 = 30 - step

step = (30)/7, so the value is 30 - (30/7) = (210/7) - (30/7) = 180/7.

Thus, the number we want is 180/7.

In Lean, to define this constant, we need to mark it noncomputable or write it as a rational number cast to ℝ.

Using rational literals would make it computable:

(180/7 : ℚ) converted to ℝ via (180/7 : ℚ) is possible using ↑(180/7).

Hence the final closed form answer is (180 / 7 : ℝ).

Concretely in Lean:

noncomputable abbrev omnimath2974_answer : ℝ := 180 / 7

(the noncomputable keyword to avoid the error with division in Reals)

Alternatively, since 180 and 7 are naturals, Lean can interpret division if we write them as reals (180 : ℝ) / 7.

Complete expression:

noncomputable abbrev omnimath2974_answer : ℝ := (180 : ℝ) / 7

But user requested just the expression without abbrev or theorem keyword, enclosed by <<< >>>.

Hence:

<<<(180 : ℝ) / 7>>>

# Explanation:

- Avoided using variables like V, P, parts in definition to keep it closed form.

- Computed the expression symbolically and simplified.

- Marked as noncomputable if used in Lean code but here just provide the closed form.

- This matches enumerated patterns and the problem's original numerical setup.

The problem essentially defines a sequence of points starting at P=3 and ending at V=33, partitioned into 6 parts. The step size is (V - P) / (parts + 1) = (33 - 3) / 7 = 30/7.

The points Q, R, S, T, U divide the interval into equal segments of length step.

The expression to evaluate is (S - P) + (V - T).

Note:
- S - P = 3 * step (because S = P + 3*step)
- V - T = (P + 6*step + step) - (P + 4*step) = 2*step (since V=P+7*step, T=P+4*step)

Therefore,
(S - P) + (V - T) = 3*step + 2*step = 5*step = 5 * (V - P) / (parts + 1) = 5 * 30/7 = 150 / 7.

So the closed-form value is 150/7.

In Lean, avoid letting variables shadow each other in `let`. Use explicit definitions or just write the formula.

Explanation:
The step size is (V - P) / (parts + 1) = (33 - 3) / 7 = 30 / 7.
The points are: P=3, Q=3 + step, R=3 + 2*step, S=3 + 3*step, T=3 + 4*step, U=3 + 5*step, V=33.
We want (S - P) + (V - T)
= (3 + 3*step - 3) + (33 - (3 + 4*step))
= 3*step + 33 - 3 - 4*step
= (3*step - 4*step) + (33 - 3)
= (-step) + 30
= 30 - step
= 30 - (30/7) = (210/7) - (30/7) = 180/7 = 5 * (33 - 3) / 7.

The initial error was because Lean wanted the definition to be marked 'noncomputable' since it uses real division. We can fix this by marking the abbreviation as 'noncomputable.'

Final answer in Lean syntax for the abbreviation, marked noncomputable:

The problem is computing the expression (S - P) + (V - T) given the definitions:

- \(P = 3\)
- \(V = 33\)
- \(\text{parts} = 6\)
- \(\text{step} = \frac{V-P}{\text{parts} + 1} = \frac{33 - 3}{7} = \frac{30}{7}\)
- \(Q = P + \text{step}\)
- \(R = Q + \text{step}\)
- \(S = R + \text{step}\)
- \(T = S + \text{step}\)
- \(U = T + \text{step}\)

We want \((S - P) + (V - T)\).

Calculate distances along the arithmetic progression:

- \(S = R + \text{step} = Q + 2\text{step} + \text{step} = Q + 3\text{step} = P + 4\text{step}\)
- \(T = S + \text{step} = P + 5\text{step}\)

Then:

\[
(S - P) + (V - T) = (P + 4 \text{step} - P) + (V - (P + 5 \text{step})) = 4 \text{step} + V - P - 5 \text{step} = (V - P) - \text{step}.
\]

Since \(\text{step} = \frac{V - P}{7}\), this simplifies to:

\[
(V - P) - \frac{V - P}{7} = (V - P) \times \frac{6}{7} = \frac{6}{7} \cdot (33 - 3) = \frac{6}{7} \times 30 = \frac{180}{7}.
\]

Your candidate answer "5 * (33 - 3) / 7" is off by a factor of 1; it should be 6 times the difference over 7, not 5.

Also, the problem is that Lean refuses to compile the definition of omnimath2974_answer because it depends on division in ℝ which may not be computationally defined. You should mark it as `noncomputable` so it can compile and be accepted.

Hence fix:

- Put `noncomputable` keyword to make Lean accept the real number division.
- Use the correct coefficient 6 instead of 5.

Thus the final Lean expression should be:

```lean
noncomputable abbrev omnimath2974_answer : ℝ := 6 * (33 - 3) / 7
```

But since you only want the expression inside the delimiters without wrappers, I'll give:

<<<6 * (33 - 3) / 7>>>
