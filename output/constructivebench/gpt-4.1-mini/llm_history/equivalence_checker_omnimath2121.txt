Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: 1989
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find natural numbers n > 0 where (n³ - 1989)/n is a perfect square (since it equals m² for some integer m).

2. Let's simplify the condition:
   (n³ - 1989)/n = n² - (1989/n)
   For this to be an integer, n must divide 1989.

3. Factorizing 1989: 1989 = 3² × 13 × 17
   So possible n values are divisors of 1989: 1, 3, 9, 13, 17, 39, 51, 117, 153, 221, 663, 1989

4. Checking these:
   - For n=13: (13³ - 1989)/13 = (2197-1989)/13 = 208/13 = 16, which is 4² (perfect square)
   - For n=1989: (1989³-1989)/1989 = 1989² - 1, which is not a perfect square (next square after 1989² is 1989²+2×1989+1)

5. The ground truth answer (13) is correct as shown above.
   The proposed answer (1989) doesn't satisfy the condition.
