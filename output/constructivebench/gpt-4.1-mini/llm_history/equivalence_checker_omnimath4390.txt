Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 1, 3), (1, 2, -3), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, -1), (0, 0, 0)}
Proposed Answer: Set.image (fun p : ℤ × ℤ => (p.1 + p.2, p.1 - p.2, 4 * p.1 * p.2)) Set.univ
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all integer triples (x,y,z) that satisfy both equations:
   - x² - y² = z
   - 3xy + (x-y)z = z²

2. The ground truth provides specific solutions: (2,1,3), (1,2,-3), (1,0,1), (0,1,-1), and (0,0,0).

3. The proposed answer suggests a parametric solution using all pairs of integers (p₁,p₂) mapped to (p₁+p₂, p₁-p₂, 4p₁p₂).

Let's test if the proposed answer covers all ground truth solutions:
- For (2,1,3): p₁=1.5, p₂=0.5 → not integers
- For (1,0,1): p₁=0.5, p₂=0.5 → not integers
- For (0,0,0): p₁=0, p₂=0 → works

The proposed parametric form doesn't generate all the solutions in the ground truth, and some solutions would require non-integer parameters. The answers are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
