Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation simplifies to:
1000w + 200x + 30y + 4z = 2014

2. We can divide both sides by 2:
500w + 100x + 15y + 2z = 1007

3. Given the constraints:
- w ∈ [1,9]
- x,y,z ∈ [0,9]

4. Let's find possible integer solutions:
- The maximum possible value (w=9) gives 4500, which is too large
- Trying w=1: 500 + 100x + 15y + 2z = 1007 → 100x + 15y + 2z = 507
- Trying x=5: 500 + 15y + 2z = 507 → 15y + 2z = 7 → only possible solution is y=0, z=3.5 (invalid)
- Trying x=4: 400 + 15y + 2z = 107 → 15y + 2z = 107 → possible solutions:
  - y=7, z=1 → sum w+x+y+z=1+4+7+1=13
  - y=5, z=16 (invalid)
  - etc.

The ground truth answer (13) matches the valid solution found (1+4+7+1). The proposed answer (7) doesn't match any valid combination.
