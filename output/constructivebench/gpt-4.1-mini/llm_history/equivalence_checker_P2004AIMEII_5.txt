Ground Truth Answer: 766
Proposed Answer: 775
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal x such that the remaining work can be completed at a rate of (800 + x) per worker for the remaining quarter.

2. The calculation steps would be:
   - Total work: 1000w
   - First 3 quarters work: (1000 + 900 + 800)(w/4) = 2700(w/4)
   - Remaining work: 1000w - 2700(w/4) = (4000w - 2700w)/4 = 1300w/4
   - Required inequality: (800 + x)(w/4) ≥ 1300w/4
   - Simplifying: 800 + x ≥ 1300 ⇒ x ≥ 500

3. However, the ground truth answer is 766 and proposed is 775, which are both much higher than 500. This suggests there might be additional constraints or a different interpretation of the problem.

4. Without seeing the exact reasoning behind both answers, we can't be certain about their equivalence, but they are clearly in the same ballpark (both in the 700s) while being different values.
