abbrev P2005AMCB_1_answer : â„• := sorry
theorem P2005AMCB_1 : 
  (1000 / 2) * 1 - (1000 / 5) * 2 = P2005AMCB_1_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 100
Proposed Answer: (1000 / 2) * 1 - (1000 / 5) * 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to evaluate the expression (1000/2)*1 - (1000/5)*2
2. Ground truth answer is 100
3. Proposed answer is the expression itself (1000/2)*1 - (1000/5)*2

Calculating the expression:
- 1000/2 = 500
- 1000/5 = 200
- So 500*1 - 200*2 = 500 - 400 = 100

The proposed answer is the unevaluated expression, while the ground truth is the evaluated result. They are not equivalent forms, though the expression does evaluate to the correct answer.
