Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the number of natural numbers n > 0 such that n² - 3n + 2 is prime.

2. Let's factor the expression: n² - 3n + 2 = (n-1)(n-2)

3. For this product to be prime, one of the factors must be ±1 and the other must be a prime number (with appropriate sign).

4. Possible cases:
   - n-1 = 1 ⇒ n=2 ⇒ expression = 0 (not prime)
   - n-1 = -1 ⇒ n=0 (invalid since n>0)
   - n-2 = 1 ⇒ n=3 ⇒ expression = 2 (prime)
   - n-2 = -1 ⇒ n=1 ⇒ expression = 0 (not prime)

5. The only valid solution is n=3, making the ground truth answer (1) correct.

6. The proposed answer (3) is incorrect as it counts more solutions than actually exist.
