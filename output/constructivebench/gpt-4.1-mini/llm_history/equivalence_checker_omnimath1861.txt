Ground Truth Answer: 3/17
Proposed Answer: 36 / 204
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating a probability ratio where:
   - There are 36 students
   - Multiples are numbers 1 through 8
   - totalPairs = 36 * 36 = 1296
   - sameMultiplePairs = sum of k² for k from 1 to 8 = 204
   - samePersonPairs = sum of k for k from 1 to 8 = 36

2. The ratio being calculated is samePersonPairs/sameMultiplePairs = 36/204

3. Simplifying 36/204:
   - Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 3/17

4. The ground truth answer is 3/17, which is exactly the simplified form of 36/204.

Therefore, the proposed answer 36/204 is equivalent to the ground truth answer 3/17, just in an unsimplified form.
