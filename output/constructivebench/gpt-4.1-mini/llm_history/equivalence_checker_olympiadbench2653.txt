Ground Truth Answer: 25
Proposed Answer: 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number K' such that the distance between the complex numbers (15 + 5i) and (1 + K'i) is at least 15*(8/5) = 24.

2. The distance between two complex numbers (a+bi) and (c+di) is √[(a-c)² + (b-d)²].

3. Calculating the distance:
   √[(15-1)² + (5-K')²] ≥ 24
   => √[196 + (5-K')²] ≥ 24
   => 196 + (5-K')² ≥ 576
   => (5-K')² ≥ 380
   => |5-K'| ≥ √380 ≈ 19.4936

4. Therefore, K' must satisfy either:
   K' ≤ 5 - 19.4936 ≈ -14.4936 (invalid since K' must be positive)
   or K' ≥ 5 + 19.4936 ≈ 24.4936

5. The smallest natural number satisfying this is 25.

The proposed answer is 9, which is clearly much smaller than the required minimum of 25. The calculations show that 9 doesn't satisfy the inequality.
