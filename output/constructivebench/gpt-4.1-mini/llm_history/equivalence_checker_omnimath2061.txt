Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 50
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n where:
   - n > 0
   - (n + 1)/(2n + 1) < 1/100

2. Let's solve the inequality:
   (n + 1)/(2n + 1) < 1/100
   100(n + 1) < 2n + 1
   100n + 100 < 2n + 1
   98n < -99
   n < -99/98 ≈ -1.01

3. This suggests there are NO positive integers satisfying the inequality, since n would need to be less than -1.01.

4. However, the ground truth answer is 6, which doesn't satisfy the inequality:
   (6 + 1)/(2*6 + 1) = 7/13 ≈ 0.538 > 0.01

5. The proposed answer is 50, which also doesn't satisfy:
   (50 + 1)/(101) ≈ 0.505 > 0.01

Both answers are incorrect as no positive integer satisfies the inequality. However, since the ground truth is given as 6 and the proposed answer is different, we should return:

<<<False>>>
