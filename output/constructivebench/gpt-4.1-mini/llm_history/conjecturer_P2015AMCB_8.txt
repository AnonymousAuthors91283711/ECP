theorem P2015AMCB_8 : 
  (625 ^ (logb 5 2015)) ^ (1/4) = P2015AMCB_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<25 * 2015 ^ (1/4)>>>

Explanation: (625^(logb 5 2015))^(1/4) = ((5^4)^(log_5 2015))^(1/4) = (5^(4 * log_5 2015))^(1/4) = (5^log_5 2015) = 2015^(1/4) * 5 = 25 * 2015^(1/4).
