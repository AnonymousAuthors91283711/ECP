Ground Truth Answer: {n | 3 ≤ n}
Proposed Answer: fun n => ∃ d : ℕ, d > 0 ∧ n = d + 1
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground Truth: {n | 3 ≤ n} means all natural numbers n where n is greater than or equal to 3.

Proposed Answer: fun n => ∃ d : ℕ, d > 0 ∧ n = d + 1
This can be rewritten as:
n = d + 1 where d > 0
Which means n = 1 + 1 = 2 when d=1, n=3 when d=2, etc.
So this represents all natural numbers n where n ≥ 2.

The difference is:
- Ground truth includes only n ≥ 3
- Proposed answer includes n ≥ 2

The condition in the theorem includes h : 1 < n, which means n ≥ 2. The ground truth is more restrictive (n ≥ 3), while the proposed answer matches exactly with n ≥ 2.

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
