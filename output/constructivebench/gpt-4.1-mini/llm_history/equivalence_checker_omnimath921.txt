Ground Truth Answer: (16^2014 - 14^2014) / 2
Proposed Answer: 2 ^ (4 * 2013)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting the number of subsets S of Fin 2014 × Fin 4 where the number of distinct first coordinates in S is odd.

2. The ground truth answer (16^2014 - 14^2014)/2 makes sense because:
   - For each of the 2014 elements, we have 16 choices (subsets of Fin 4)
   - We subtract cases where all elements have even-sized subsets (14^2014)
   - We divide by 2 since exactly half of the remaining cases will have odd count

3. The proposed answer 2^(4*2013) = 2^8052 is:
   - Equal to 16^2013 (since 16 = 2^4)
   - This is significantly different from the ground truth answer
   - It doesn't account for the oddness condition or the correct counting mechanism

The two answers are not equivalent.
