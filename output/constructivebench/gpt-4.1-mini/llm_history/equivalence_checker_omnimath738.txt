Ground Truth Answer: 372
Proposed Answer: (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8)*8
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal possible sum of an 8x8 matrix where each entry M[i,j] ≥ max(i+1,j+1) (since Fin 8 has values 0-7, but i.1+1 makes it 1-8).

2. The ground truth answer is 372, which comes from:
   - The minimal matrix would have M[i,j] = max(i+1,j+1)
   - The sum can be calculated by considering the "L-shaped" layers:
     * 1 appears only at M[0,0] → 1×1
     * 2 appears in first row and column except [0,0] → (8-1)×2 + (8-1)×2 - 1×2 = 14×2
     * Similarly for other numbers up to 8
     * Total sum = 1 + 28 + 51 + 72 + 91 + 108 + 123 + 136 = 372

3. The proposed answer is (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8)*8 = 36*8 = 288
   - This would be correct if all M[i,j] ≥ i+1 (row condition only)
   - But the problem has M[i,j] ≥ max(i+1,j+1), which is stricter
   - The proposed answer underestimates the minimal sum
