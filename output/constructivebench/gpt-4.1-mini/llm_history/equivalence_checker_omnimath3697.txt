Ground Truth Answer: { fun _ => 0, id, fun x => -x }
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℝ, (f = fun x => c * x) ∧ (c = 0 ∨ c = 1)}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is close but not entirely equivalent to the ground truth. The ground truth includes three specific functions: the zero function (f(x) = 0), the identity function (f(x) = x), and the negation function (f(x) = -x). The proposed answer captures the zero function (when c=0) and the identity function (when c=1), but misses the negation function (which would require c=-1). The proposed answer's condition (c=0 ∨ c=1) is too restrictive, as c=-1 should also be included.
