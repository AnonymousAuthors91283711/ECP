Ground Truth Answer: 56
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the value of a multivariate polynomial P evaluated at (2,4,8) under certain conditions:
   - P has total degree 4
   - P is cyclic in its variables (a,b,c)
   - P vanishes when two variables are equal (a,a,b)
   - P evaluates to 1 at (1,2,3)

2. The ground truth answer is 56, which comes from recognizing that P must be a multiple of the Vandermonde polynomial (a-b)(b-c)(c-a), and then finding the appropriate scaling factor to match the condition at (1,2,3).

3. The proposed answer is 8, which is incorrect. This doesn't satisfy the scaling required by the condition at (1,2,3) and doesn't account for the degree 4 requirement properly.

The answers are not equivalent.
