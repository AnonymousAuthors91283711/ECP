Ground Truth Answer: 64
Proposed Answer: 16
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a natural number n where the product of terms i/(i+1) from i=1 to n-1, when square rooted, equals 1/8.

2. The product ∏ (i/(i+1)) from i=1 to n-1 is a telescoping product that simplifies to 1/n.

3. Therefore, the equation becomes √(1/n) = 1/8, which means 1/n = (1/8)² = 1/64, so n = 64.

4. The proposed answer is 16, which would give √(1/16) = 1/4 ≠ 1/8.

The ground truth answer (64) is correct, while the proposed answer (16) is incorrect.
