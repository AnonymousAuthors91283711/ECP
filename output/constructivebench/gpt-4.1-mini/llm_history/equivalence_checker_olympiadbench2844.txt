Ground Truth Answer: 2018
Proposed Answer: 2019
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest year y > 2012 where the number of days between 2012 and y is divisible by 7 (i.e., the same weekday as 2012).

2. The ground truth answer is 2018. Let's verify:
   - Years between 2012 and 2017: 2016 is a leap year (divisible by 4, not divisible by 100)
   - Days = (2018-2012)*365 + 1 = 6*365 + 1 = 2191
   - 2191 mod 7 = 0 (since 2100 is divisible by 7, and 91 is divisible by 7)

3. The proposed answer is 2019:
   - Days = (2019-2012)*365 + 1 = 7*365 + 1 = 2556
   - 2556 mod 7 = 2556 - 7*365 = 2556 - 2555 = 1 ≠ 0

The proposed answer is incorrect because 2019 doesn't satisfy the condition (days not divisible by 7), while 2018 does. The correct answer is indeed 2018.
