theorem omnimath1622 (n : ℕ) (hn : n > 0) : 
  omnimath1622_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → Prop
Explanation: Without explicit conditions, a typical generalization for a positive natural number property is `omnimath1622_answer n := n > 0`. This matches the given `hn : n > 0` and is a minimal closed form that eliminates existential quantifiers and fits the type `ℕ → Prop`.
