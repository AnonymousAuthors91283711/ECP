<<<2 ^ (4 * 2013)>>>

Explanation: For each of the 2014 elements in Fin 2014, the parity of its presence is determined by a subset selection over its 4 associated elements. The number of such subsets with odd cardinality projects to counting subsets over 2013 elements, yielding 2^(4*2013). This matches the parity constraints and the combinatorial structure.
