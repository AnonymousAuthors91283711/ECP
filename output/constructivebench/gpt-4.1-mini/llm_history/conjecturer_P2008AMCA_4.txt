theorem P2008AMCA_4 : 
  (∏ n in Finset.range 502, (4 * (n + 2)) / (4 * (n + 1))) = P2008AMCA_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The product telescopes as:

∏_{n=0}^{501} (4(n+2))/(4(n+1)) = ∏_{n=0}^{501} (n+2)/(n+1) = (2/1)*(3/2)*...*(503/502) = 503/1 = 503

Since 503 is a natural number, the answer is 503.

<<<503>>>
