Ground Truth Answer: 721480000 / 27
Proposed Answer: 20 * 40 * 1675
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find the maximum product x*y*z under given constraints (x≥20, y≥40, z≥1675, x+y+z=2015).

2. The ground truth answer (721480000/27 ≈ 26,721,481.48) suggests that the maximum occurs at some non-boundary point where the variables are not all at their minimum constraints.

3. The proposed answer (20*40*1675 = 1,340,000) simply multiplies the minimum values of each variable, which would give the minimum product, not the maximum.

4. For maximization problems with sum constraints, the maximum product typically occurs when the variables are as unequal as possible (given their constraints), not when they're all at their minimums.

The proposed answer is completely wrong as it gives the minimum product rather than the maximum.
