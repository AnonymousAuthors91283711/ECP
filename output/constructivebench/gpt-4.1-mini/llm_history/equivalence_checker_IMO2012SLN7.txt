Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | n % 4 = 1 ∨ n % 4 = 2}
Proposed Answer: fun n => n = 1 ∨ n = 2
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer lists specific cases (n=1 and n=2) that are indeed part of the ground truth answer (since 1%4=1 and 2%4=2). However, the proposed answer is incomplete as it doesn't cover all numbers satisfying n%4=1 or n%4=2 (e.g., n=5, n=6, etc.). The proposed answer is correct for the given examples but fails to capture the general pattern.
