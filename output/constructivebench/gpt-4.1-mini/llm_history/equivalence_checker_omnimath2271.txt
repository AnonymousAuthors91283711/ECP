Ground Truth Answer: (991, 997, 1009)
Proposed Answer: (23, 43, 991)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for three distinct primes p < q < r such that p*q*r = 989*1001*1007 + 320, and that this triple is unique.

2. First calculate the product:
   989*1001*1007 + 320 = (1000-11)(1000+1)(1000+7) + 320
   = (1000²-10*1000-11)(1000+7) + 320
   = (1,000,000 - 10,000 - 11)(1007) + 320
   = 989,989 * 1007 + 320
   = 996,917,923 + 320
   = 996,918,243

3. Now check the proposed answers:
   - Ground truth: 991*997*1009 = 991*(1000-3)(1000+9) = 991*(1,000,000 + 6000 - 27) = 991*1,005,973 = 996,918,243
   - Proposed answer: 23*43*991 = 989*991 = (1000-11)*991 = 991,000 - 10,901 = 980,099 ≠ 996,918,243

The proposed answer's product doesn't match the required value, while the ground truth does. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
