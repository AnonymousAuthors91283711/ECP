Ground Truth Answer: 235
Proposed Answer: 392
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves finding integer solutions to:
   - a³ = b² (perfect square and cube)
   - c⁵ = d⁴ (perfect fourth and fifth powers)
   - c - a = 77

2. For the ground truth answer (235):
   - Typical solutions found are a=16, b=64 (since 16³=4096=64²)
   - Then c=93 (since 93-16=77)
   - 93⁵ = d⁴ leads to d=93^(5/4)*k, and the minimal integer solution is d=93^(5/4)*4≈228
   - However, 235 suggests there might be a different combination where d-b=235

3. The proposed answer (392) is significantly larger than the ground truth. Given the constraints:
   - For d-b to be 392, we'd need extremely large numbers that likely wouldn't satisfy all the given equations
   - The difference seems too large to satisfy all conditions simultaneously

4. The ground truth answer comes from a specific solution that fits all constraints, while 392 doesn't appear to correspond to any valid solution.
