abbrev omnimath3260_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3260 (x : ℝ) : (512 : ℝ)^x = (64 : ℝ)^240 ↔ x = omnimath3260_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: 240 / 3. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 7, which is at "omnimath3260_answer " in "abbrev omnimath3260_answer : ℝ := 240 / 3", there is an error: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instDivInvMonoid', and it does not have executable code.

The error occurs because in Lean's mathlib, division of real numbers is not always considered computable due to dependencies on noncomputable instances like Real.instDivInvMonoid. To fix this, you can mark the abbreviation as noncomputable, or better yet, use a division by a numeral (which Lean can evaluate), or rewrite the division as multiplication by an inverse.

Since 512^x = 64^240, and 512 = 8^3 = 2^9, 64 = 2^6, so:

512^x = 64^240
(2^9)^x = (2^6)^240
2^{9x} = 2^{1440}
So 9x = 1440
x = 1440 / 9 = 160

So the answer is 160 (not 240 / 3), though 240 / 3 is 80. So the "240 / 3" in the proposed answer is probably miscalculated.

Let me verify:

Given (512)^x = (64)^{240},

512 = 2^9, 64=2^6

So 2^{9x} = 2^{6 * 240} = 2^{1440}

So 9x = 1440 => x = 160

Therefore, the final answer is 160.

So the corrected answer is 160.

In Lean, to avoid the noncomputable division error, write it as something like (1440 : ℝ) / 9, but since it generates error, better to write the rational number as a decimal or as a fraction involving nat_cast and division with nat.

Alternatively, just mark the abbreviation as noncomputable.

Here is a compiled version:

noncomputable abbrev omnimath3260_answer : ℝ := 160

or

noncomputable abbrev omnimath3260_answer : ℝ := (1440 : ℝ) / 9

But given instructions, probably just write "160" as the answer.

Therefore, here is the final answer:

<<<160>>>
