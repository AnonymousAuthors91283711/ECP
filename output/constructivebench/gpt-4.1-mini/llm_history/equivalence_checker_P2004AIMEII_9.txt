Ground Truth Answer: 973
Proposed Answer: 1455
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a sequence with specific base cases and a recursive pattern for n ≥ 11.
2. It asks to find the largest n where seq(n) < 1000, then compute n + seq(n).
3. The ground truth answer is 973.
4. The proposed answer is 1455.

Looking at the sequence definition:
- For odd n ≥ 11: seq(n) = n²
- For even n ≥ 11: seq(n) = n*(n+2)

The maximum n where seq(n) < 1000 would be:
- For odd n: largest odd n where n² < 1000 → 31 (since 31²=961, 33²=1089)
- For even n: largest even n where n(n+2) < 1000 → 30 (since 30*32=960, 32*34=1088)

The maximum seq(n) is 961 (n=31), so max_n = 31.
Then max_n + seq(max_n) = 31 + 961 = 992, which doesn't match either answer.

However, the ground truth answer 973 comes from:
- n=28, seq(28)=28*30=840 → 28+840=868
- n=27, seq(27)=27²=729 → 27+729=756
- n=26, seq(26)=26*28=728 → 26+728=754
None of these match 973.

The proposed answer 1455 is even further off. Both answers seem incorrect based on the sequence definition.
