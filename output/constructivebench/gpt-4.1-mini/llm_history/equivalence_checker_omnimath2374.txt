Ground Truth Answer: 2 ^ 2013 - 6036
Proposed Answer: (2 : ℤ) ^ 2012 - 2012
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recurrence relation with:
   - Base cases: x₁ = 1, x₂ = 2
   - Recurrence: xₙ₊₂ = 2xₙ₊₁ - xₙ + 2ⁿ

2. The ground truth answer is 2²⁰¹³ - 6036
3. The proposed answer is 2²⁰¹² - 2012

To check equivalence:
- The exponent in the proposed answer is off by 1 (2012 vs 2013)
- The constant term is also different (2012 vs 6036)

Let's verify with small values:
For n=3: x₃ = 2x₂ - x₁ + 2¹ = 4-1+2 = 5
Ground truth: 2⁴-12 = 16-12 = 4 ≠ 5
Proposed: 2³-3 = 8-3 = 5 → matches for n=3

For n=4: x₄ = 2x₃ - x₂ + 2² = 10-2+4 = 12
Ground truth: 2⁵-20 = 32-20 = 12 → matches
Proposed: 2⁴-4 = 16-4 = 12 → matches

For n=5: x₅ = 2x₄ - x₃ + 2³ = 24-5+8 = 27
Ground truth: 2⁶-28 = 64-28 = 36 ≠ 27
Proposed: 2⁵-5 = 32-5 = 27 → matches

The proposed answer seems correct for small values, while the ground truth doesn't. The general solution should be xₙ = 2ⁿ - n, which matches the proposed answer.
