theorem omnimath3618 (p : ℝ[X]) :
    (∀ x : ℝ, eval x (X + C 10) * eval (2 * x) p = eval x (8 * X - C 32) * eval (x + 6) p) ∧
    eval 1 p = 210 ↔ p = omnimath3618_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2 * (X + C 4) * (X - C 4) * (X - C 8)
Proposed Answer: (X - C 2) * (X - C 5) * (X - C 7)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem states a functional equation that must hold for all real x, and specifies p(1) = 210.

2. The ground truth answer is a cubic polynomial with roots at -4, 4, and 8, scaled by 2.

3. The proposed answer is a different cubic polynomial with roots at 2, 5, and 7.

4. To verify equivalence, we need to check:
   - Both are degree 3 polynomials
   - Both satisfy p(1) = 210
   - Both satisfy the functional equation

Testing p(1):
- Ground truth: 2*(1+4)*(1-4)*(1-8) = 2*5*(-3)*(-7) = 210 ✓
- Proposed: (1-2)*(1-5)*(1-7) = (-1)*(-4)*(-6) = -24 ≠ 210 ✗

The proposed answer doesn't even satisfy the given condition p(1) = 210, let alone the functional equation.
