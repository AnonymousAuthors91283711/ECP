Ground Truth Answer: fun k n => n * (3 * k)
Proposed Answer: fun k n => Nat.choose (2 * n) 2 * k / (k + 1)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number m such that there exists a function f from Fin m to subsets of Fin(2n) where:
   - Each f(i) has exactly 2 elements
   - For any subset of size k+1, there are two distinct elements whose images under f intersect

2. The ground truth answer is m = n * (3 * k), which suggests a linear relationship with both n and k.

3. The proposed answer is a combinatorial expression involving binomial coefficients and division.

Key observations:
- The proposed answer grows quadratically with n (since choose(2n,2) ≈ 2n²), while the ground truth grows linearly.
- The proposed answer's behavior with k is more complex (k/(k+1) factor) compared to the simple linear 3k in ground truth.
- For concrete small values, they disagree:
  - When k=1, n=1: ground truth gives 3, proposed gives choose(2,2)*1/2 = 0
  - When k=2, n=2: ground truth gives 12, proposed gives choose(4,2)*2/3 ≈ 4

The answers are clearly different in both form and numerical results.
