theorem IMO2019SLN4 (C : ℕ) (f : ℕ → ℕ) :

Ground Truth Answer: fun C => {f | ∃ k : ℕ, ∀ a : ℕ, f a = k * a}
Proposed Answer: fun C : ℕ => {f : ℕ → ℕ | ∃ c : ℕ, c > 0 ∧ (∀ n, f n = c * n)}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both define the set of functions f where f(n) is a constant multiple of n (f(n) = k*n or f(n) = c*n). The only difference is that the proposed answer explicitly states c > 0, but this is implied in the ground truth answer since k is a natural number (ℕ) and the function must return natural numbers (ℕ → ℕ), so k must be at least 1 (as 0 would make f(n) = 0 for all n, which wouldn't satisfy the original problem's condition when a=1, b=C+1). The variable names (k vs c) don't affect the meaning.
