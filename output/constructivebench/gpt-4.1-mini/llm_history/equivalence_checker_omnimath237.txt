theorem omnimath237 (a b c : Int) :
    a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = a^2 * b^2 ↔ (a, b, c) ∈ omnimath237_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0, 0)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b, c) : ℤ × ℤ × ℤ | a = 0 ∧ b = 0} ∪
{(1, 0, 0), (-1, 0, 0)} ∪ {(0, 1, 0), (0, -1, 0)}
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The ground truth answer only includes (0,0,0)
2. The proposed answer includes:
   - All triples where a=0 and b=0 (which includes (0,0,0) but also (0,0,c) for any c)
   - Additional points like (1,0,0), (-1,0,0), etc.

Testing the equation a² + b² + c² = a²b²:
- For (0,0,0): 0+0+0 = 0*0 → valid
- For (0,0,c) where c≠0: 0+0+c² = 0 → only valid when c=0
- For (1,0,0): 1+0+0 = 1*0 → 1=0 → invalid
- Similarly other non-(0,0,0) points fail the equation

The proposed answer incorrectly includes many invalid solutions and misses the constraint that c must also be 0 when a=b=0.
