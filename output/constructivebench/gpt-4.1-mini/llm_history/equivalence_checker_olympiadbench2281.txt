noncomputable abbrev olympiadbench2281_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2281 :
  (3 * (8 : ℝ) ^ x + 5 * (8 : ℝ) ^ x = 2 ^ 61 ↔ x = olympiadbench2281_answer) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 58 / 3
Proposed Answer: (61 : ℝ) - 1
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
We have the equation 3*8^x + 5*8^x = 2^61, which simplifies to 8*8^x = 2^61 or 8^(x+1) = 2^61.

Solution Steps:
1. Rewrite 8 as 2^3: (2^3)^(x+1) = 2^61
2. Simplify exponents: 2^(3(x+1)) = 2^61
3. Since bases are equal, set exponents equal: 3(x+1) = 61
4. Solve for x: x = (61/3) - 1 = 58/3

Ground Truth Answer: 58/3 (exact solution)
Proposed Answer: 61 - 1 = 60 (incorrect simplification)

The proposed answer incorrectly simplifies the equation and gets 60, which is not equal to 58/3. The correct solution requires maintaining the fractional part.
