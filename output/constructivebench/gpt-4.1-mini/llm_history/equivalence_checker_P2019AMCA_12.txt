Ground Truth Answer: 20
Proposed Answer: 16
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves logarithmic equations with constraints x,y > 0 and x,y ≠ 1, plus the condition x*y = 64.

2. From h1: log₂x = log_y16, we can rewrite this using change of base formula as:
   log₂x = log₂16 / log₂y ⇒ log₂x * log₂y = 4

3. We know from h2 that x*y = 64 ⇒ log₂x + log₂y = 6

4. Let a = log₂x and b = log₂y, then we have:
   a + b = 6
   a * b = 4

5. We need to find (log₂(x/y))² = (a - b)²

6. Calculate (a - b)² = (a + b)² - 4ab = 36 - 16 = 20

The ground truth answer is 20, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 16, which is incorrect as it doesn't account for the full expression (a + b)² - 4ab.
