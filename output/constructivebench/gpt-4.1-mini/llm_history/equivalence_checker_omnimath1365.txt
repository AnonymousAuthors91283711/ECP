Ground Truth Answer: (35, 90)
Proposed Answer: (15, 21)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find the greatest pair (p₁, p₂) where:
   - 1 ≤ p₁ ≤ p₂ ≤ 100
   - There exists a natural number k such that (p₁ + p₂)(p₁ + p₂ + 1) = k * p₁ * p₂

2. The ground truth answer is (35, 90). Let's verify it:
   (35+90)(35+90+1) = 125*126 = 15750
   35*90 = 3150
   15750/3150 = 5 (which is a natural number)

3. The proposed answer is (15, 21):
   (15+21)(15+21+1) = 36*37 = 1332
   15*21 = 315
   1332/315 ≈ 4.228... (not a natural number)

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the condition that k must be a natural number, while the ground truth answer does. Therefore, they are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
