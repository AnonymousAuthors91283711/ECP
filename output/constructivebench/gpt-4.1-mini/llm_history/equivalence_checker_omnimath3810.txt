Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(x, y) | x = 0 ∧ y = 0} ∪ {(2 * k^3, k) | k : ℕ}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation is x³y + x + y = xy + 2xy²
2. Let's test the ground truth solutions:
   - (0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 + 0 → valid
   - (1,1): 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 + 2 → valid (3=3)
   - (2,2): 16 + 2 + 2 = 4 + 16 → valid (20=20)

3. Now examine the proposed answer:
   - First part {(x,y) | x=0 ∧ y=0} matches (0,0)
   - Second part {(2*k³, k)}:
     * For k=1: (2,1) → 8 + 2 + 1 = 2 + 4 → 11=6 (invalid)
     * For k=2: (16,2) → 8192 + 16 + 2 = 32 + 128 → 8210=160 (invalid)
     * Only works when k=0 → (0,0) which we already have

4. The proposed answer misses (1,1) and (2,2) which are valid solutions, and includes invalid solutions like (2,1) and (16,2).
