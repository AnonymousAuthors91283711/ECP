theorem omnimath741 :
  let S := {n | n ∈ Icc 1 2024 ∧ Nat.gcd (99 + n) (99 * n + 1) = 1 ∧ Nat.gcd (101 + n) (101 * n + 1) = 1}

Ground Truth Answer: 96 / 595
Proposed Answer: (1764 : ℚ) / 2024
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting numbers n from 1 to 2024 that satisfy two gcd conditions:
   - gcd(99 + n, 99n + 1) = 1
   - gcd(101 + n, 101n + 1) = 1

2. The ground truth answer is 96/595, which when multiplied by 2024 gives approximately 326.4 numbers.

3. The proposed answer is 1764/2024, which simplifies to 441/506 ≈ 0.8715, meaning about 1764 numbers satisfy the condition.

4. The two answers are very different in magnitude (96/595 ≈ 0.1613 vs 1764/2024 ≈ 0.8715).

5. The proposed answer claims many more numbers satisfy the condition than the ground truth suggests.

6. Without detailed calculation, we can see these answers cannot both be correct as they differ by a factor of about 5.4.
