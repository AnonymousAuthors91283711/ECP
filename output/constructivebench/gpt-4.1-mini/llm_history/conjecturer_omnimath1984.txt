The conditions restrict n < 2012 with all divisors d having binary representation with at most two 1s. Such divisors are powers of two or sums of two distinct powers of two. The maximal n meeting this is the sum of the largest two powers of two under 2012. The largest is 1024, next is 512, then 256; 1024+512=1536 < 2012 and all divisors have ≤2 ones in binary. This is maximal under constraints.
