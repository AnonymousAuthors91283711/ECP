  2^a + p^b = n^(p-1) ↔ (a, b, n, p) ∈ omnimath4162_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(3, 0, 3, 3)}
Proposed Answer: { (p - 1, 1, 2, p) | p ∈ { n : ℕ | Nat.Prime n } }
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem: Find all quadruples (a, b, n, p) where p is prime that satisfy 2^a + p^b = n^(p-1).

Ground Truth Answer: Only (3, 0, 3, 3) satisfies the equation (since 2^3 + 3^0 = 8 + 1 = 9 = 3^(3-1)).

Proposed Answer: Suggests all quadruples of the form (p-1, 1, 2, p) for any prime p. Let's test this:
For p=3: (2, 1, 2, 3) → 2^2 + 3^1 = 4 + 3 = 7 ≠ 2^(3-1) = 4 → Doesn't work
For p=2: (1, 1, 2, 2) → 2^1 + 2^1 = 4 ≠ 2^(2-1) = 2 → Doesn't work

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the only valid solution (3,0,3,3). The proposed form doesn't satisfy the equation for any prime p.
