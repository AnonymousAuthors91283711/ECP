abbrev omnimath3137_answer : â„• := sorry
theorem omnimath3137 : 
  (5 * (5 - 1)) + (4 * (4 - 1)) = omnimath3137_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 32
Proposed Answer: 5 * 4 + 4 * 3
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer simplifies to 20 + 12 = 32, which matches the ground truth answer. Both expressions evaluate to the same result.
