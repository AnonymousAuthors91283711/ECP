theorem P2011AMCA_6 :
  ∃ (t w : ℕ),
    3 * t + 2 * w + (w + 1) = 61 ∧
    2 * w = 3 * t ∧
    P2011AMCA_6_answer = w + 1 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: 20
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a system of equations:
   - 3t + 2w + (w + 1) = 61
   - 2w = 3t
   - The answer is defined as w + 1

2. Simplifying the first equation using the second equation (2w = 3t):
   - 3t + 2w + w + 1 = 61
   - (2w) + 2w + w + 1 = 61 (since 3t = 2w)
   - 5w + 1 = 61
   - 5w = 60
   - w = 12

3. Then the answer is w + 1 = 13

The ground truth answer is 13, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 20, which is incorrect.
