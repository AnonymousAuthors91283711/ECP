abbrev omnimath4066_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath4066 (n k : ℕ) (h : n ≥ k) :
    (n, k) ∈ omnimath4066_answer ↔ k!! * (n - k)!! ∣ n!! := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(n, k) | k = 0 ∨ k = n ∨ (Even n ∧ Even k) ∨ (n, k) = (2, 1)}
Proposed Answer: { p : ℕ × ℕ | p.1 ≥ p.2 ∧ (p.1 % 2 = p.2 % 2) }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding pairs (n,k) where n ≥ k and k!! * (n-k)!! divides n!!.

2. The ground truth answer states that this holds when:
   - k = 0 (trivial case)
   - k = n (trivial case)
   - Both n and k are even
   - Special case (2,1)

3. The proposed answer says the condition is n ≥ k and n and k have the same parity (both even or both odd).

Comparison:
- The proposed answer correctly captures the cases where both are even (matches ground truth)
- It misses the k=0 and k=n cases (which work regardless of parity)
- It incorrectly includes cases where both are odd (only (2,1) works among odd pairs)
- It misses the special case (2,1) which satisfies the condition despite both being odd

The proposed answer is mostly correct for even numbers but incorrect for odd numbers and misses some special cases.
