Ground Truth Answer: 5/72
Proposed Answer: (6! / (3! * 2! * 1!)) * ((1/2)^3 * (2*(1 - 1/2)/3)^2 * ((1 - 1/2)/3))
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer step by step.

1. The problem is calculating a probability using a multinomial distribution formula:
   (n! / (k₁!k₂!k₃!)) * (p₁^k₁ * p₂^k₂ * p₃^k₃)

2. Given values:
   - n = 6
   - k = [3, 2, 1]
   - p_A = 1/2
   - p_M = 2*(1-p_A)/3 = 2*(1/2)/3 = 1/3
   - p_C = (1-p_A)/3 = (1/2)/3 = 1/6

3. The proposed answer correctly:
   - Uses the factorial terms (6!/(3!2!1!))
   - Uses the correct probabilities (1/2, 1/3, 1/6)
   - Raises each probability to the correct power (3, 2, 1 respectively)

4. Calculating the proposed expression:
   (720/(6*2*1)) * ((1/8)*(1/9)*(1/6)) = (720/12) * (1/432) = 60 * (1/432) = 60/432 = 5/36

5. However, the ground truth answer is 5/72, which is half of our calculation.

The discrepancy comes from the p_M calculation in the proposed answer:
- It uses 2*(1 - 1/2)/3 = 1/3 (correct)
- But in the multiplication it uses (2*(1 - 1/2)/3)^2 = (1/3)^2 (correct)
- The final calculation matches the expression but gives 5/36 instead of 5/72

The ground truth answer 5/72 would be correct if p_M were 1/6 and p_C were 1/3, but according to the problem statement, it's the opposite. Therefore, the proposed answer correctly implements the given formula but doesn't match the ground truth answer.
