Ground Truth Answer: 42
Proposed Answer: 15
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a set S of real numbers y that satisfy certain conditions with x and z.
2. It claims there are exactly two distinct y values (y₁ and y₂) in S.
3. The ground truth says the negative sum of these y values is 42.
4. The proposed answer says this negative sum is 15.

To verify:
- The conditions give us:
  x + y = 7 ⇒ x = 7 - y
  (x + y + z)² = 4 ⇒ (7 + z)² = 4 ⇒ z = -5 or z = -9
- For each z case, using x*z = -180:
  Case z = -5: (7-y)*(-5) = -180 ⇒ y = -29
  Case z = -9: (7-y)*(-9) = -180 ⇒ y = -13
- Sum of y values: -29 + (-13) = -42
- Negative sum: 42

The ground truth matches our calculation, while the proposed answer (15) does not.
