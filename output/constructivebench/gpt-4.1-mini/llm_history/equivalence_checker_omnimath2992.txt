Ground Truth Answer: fun total dog cat turtle => min (min dog cat) turtle - (dog + cat + turtle - 2 * total)
Proposed Answer: fun total dog cat turtle => max 0 (dog + cat + turtle - 2 * total)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the difference between the maximum and minimum possible sizes of the triple intersection A∩B∩C given the sizes of sets A, B, C and their containment in a universal set of size 'total'.

2. The ground truth answer correctly gives:
   - Maximum intersection size: min(min dog cat) turtle
   - Minimum intersection size: max(0, dog + cat + turtle - 2*total)
   - Therefore difference is: min(min dog cat) turtle - max(0, dog + cat + turtle - 2*total)

3. The proposed answer only gives the second term (minimum intersection size) but doesn't subtract it from the maximum intersection size. It's missing the crucial first part of the calculation.

The answers are not equivalent because:
- The proposed answer only computes part of what's needed (just the minimum intersection)
- It doesn't compute the difference between max and min intersection sizes
- The max 0 operation is correct for the minimum intersection, but that's only one component
