Ground Truth Answer: 151
Proposed Answer: 64
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines two functions:
   - f(n) sums the digits of n in base 4
   - g(n) sums the digits of f(n) in base 8

2. We're looking for the smallest positive integer n where:
   - g(n) has at least one digit ≥10 when represented in base 16

3. Ground truth answer is 151
4. Proposed answer is 64

Let's test the proposed answer (64):
- f(64): digits of 64 in base 4 are [1,0,0,0] (since 4^3=64), sum is 1
- g(64): digits of 1 in base 8 is just [1], sum is 1
- digits of 1 in base 16 is just [1], no digit ≥10

The proposed answer 64 doesn't satisfy the condition, while the ground truth 151 does (verifiable through similar calculations).

<<<False>>>
