Ground Truth Answer: (7, 14, 18)
Proposed Answer: (9, 18, 22)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem requires finding natural numbers (r, q, p) that satisfy:
   - q = 2 * r
   - q = p - 4
   - (p + q + r) / 3 = 13

2. For the ground truth answer (7, 14, 18):
   - 14 = 2*7 (true)
   - 14 = 18-4 (true)
   - (18+14+7)/3 = 39/3 = 13 (true)

3. For the proposed answer (9, 18, 22):
   - 18 = 2*9 (true)
   - 18 = 22-4 (true)
   - (22+18+9)/3 = 49/3 ≈ 16.33 ≠ 13 (false)

The proposed answer fails the third condition. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
