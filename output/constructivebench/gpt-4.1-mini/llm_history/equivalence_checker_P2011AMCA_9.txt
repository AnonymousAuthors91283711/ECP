Ground Truth Answer: 441
Proposed Answer: 54
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem involves calculating handshakes between twins and triplets at a party. The ground truth answer is 441, while the proposed answer is 54.

Looking at the calculations:
1. twins = 9 * 2 = 18
2. triplets = 6 * 3 = 18
3. twin_handshakes = 9 * (2 * (18 - 2) + 2 * (18 / 2)) = 9 * (32 + 18) = 9 * 50 = 450
4. triplet_handshakes = 6 * (3 * (18 - 3) + 3 * (18 / 2)) = 6 * (45 + 27) = 6 * 72 = 432
5. Total handshakes = (450 + 432)/2 = 882/2 = 441

The proposed answer of 54 is clearly incorrect as it doesn't match the correct calculation. The ground truth answer of 441 is correct based on the given formulas.
