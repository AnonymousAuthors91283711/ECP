noncomputable abbrev omnimath1398_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1398 :
  (∑' n : ℕ, (2*n).choose n * (1/5^n) = omnimath1398_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<(25 : ℝ)>>>

The series ∑ (2n choose n) (1/5)^n converges to 25, known from the generating function (1 - 4x)^(-1/2) evaluated at x = 1/5.
