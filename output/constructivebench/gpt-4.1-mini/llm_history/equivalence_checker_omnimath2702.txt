Ground Truth Answer: 500
Proposed Answer: 512
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the count of 4-digit numbers (1000-9999) where:
   - The thousands digit is even
   - The hundreds digit is even
   - The tens digit is even
   - The units digit is even

2. For a 4-digit number:
   - Thousands digit: 1-9 (must be even: 2,4,6,8 → 4 choices)
   - Hundreds digit: 0-9 (even: 0,2,4,6,8 → 5 choices)
   - Tens digit: same as hundreds → 5 choices
   - Units digit: same → 5 choices

3. Total combinations: 4 (thousands) × 5 (hundreds) × 5 (tens) × 5 (units) = 4 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 500

The ground truth answer (500) matches this calculation exactly. The proposed answer (512) is incorrect as it doesn't follow from the digit constraints.

<<<False>>>
