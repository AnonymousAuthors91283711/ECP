Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the minimal value of x + z given:
   - x, y, z are positive integers
   - x*y = 20
   - y*z = 12

2. From x*y = 20 and y*z = 12, we can derive:
   - x = 20/y
   - z = 12/y
   - Since x and z must be integers, y must be a common divisor of 20 and 12

3. The common divisors of 20 and 12 are: 1, 2, 4

4. Let's evaluate x + z for each possible y:
   - y=1: x=20, z=12 → x+z=32
   - y=2: x=10, z=6 → x+z=16
   - y=4: x=5, z=3 → x+z=8

5. The minimal sum is indeed 8 (when y=4), not 7.

The ground truth answer (8) is correct, while the proposed answer (7) is incorrect as it's not achievable under the given constraints.
