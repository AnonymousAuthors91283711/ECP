Ground Truth Answer: fun (n, m) => if Even n ∨ Even m then choose (n + m) n else 0
Proposed Answer: fun p => (Nat.choose (p.1 + p.2) p.1) - (Nat.choose (p.1 + p.2) (p.1 / 2 + 1))
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting certain binary paths (functions from Fin(n+m) to Bool) with specific constraints on the counts of true/false values and parity conditions.

2. The ground truth answer states:
   - If either n or m is even, the count is choose(n+m, n)
   - Otherwise (both odd), the count is 0

3. The proposed answer suggests:
   - Total paths (choose(n+m, n)) minus some correction term (choose(n+m, n/2+1))

Key observations:
- The ground truth makes a clear distinction based on parity (even/odd) of n and m
- The proposed answer doesn't explicitly handle the parity cases
- When both n and m are odd, the ground truth gives 0, but the proposed answer would give a non-zero value (since choose(n+m,n) would be positive)
- The correction term in the proposed answer doesn't properly account for the parity constraints in the problem

The answers are not equivalent because:
1. They behave differently when both n and m are odd
2. The proposed answer's correction term doesn't correctly implement the parity constraints
