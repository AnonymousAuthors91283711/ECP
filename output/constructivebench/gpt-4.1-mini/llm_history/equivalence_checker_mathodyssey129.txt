Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 2
Proposed Answer: fun n => n - 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal number of distinct values (k) in a friendship graph where:
   - The graph is undirected (friendship is symmetric)
   - No self-friendships
   - Every vertex has at least one friend
   - Each vertex has a unique positive number
   - We're counting distinct "heard" values (weighted sums of friends' numbers)

2. The ground truth answer suggests that for any n > 2, there are always exactly 2 distinct heard values.

3. The proposed answer suggests the number is n-1, meaning almost all vertices have distinct heard values.

Intuition suggests the ground truth is correct because:
- In such friendship graphs, vertices typically fall into two categories (like in strongly regular graphs)
- The heard values would naturally cluster into two groups based on the graph's structure
- Having n-1 distinct values would require an extremely irregular graph that likely violates some constraints

The proposed answer seems incorrect as it suggests much more variation in heard values than what's typically possible under these constraints.
