Ground Truth Answer: 9/10
Proposed Answer: 400 / 625
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the ratio of two volumes (measures) in ℝ:
   - Numerator: Volume of x ∈ [0,1000] where a certain floor function condition holds
   - Denominator: Total volume of [0,1000] (which is simply 1000)

2. The ground truth answer is 9/10 (0.9)

3. The proposed answer is 400/625, which simplifies to 16/25 (0.64)

4. The condition involves nested floor functions with divisions by 2.5, which is equivalent to dividing by 6.25 (2.5²) in the right side. The key is to find where the floor function equality holds.

5. The proposed answer (0.64) is significantly different from the ground truth (0.9), and there's no obvious transformation that would make them equivalent.
