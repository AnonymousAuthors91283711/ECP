Ground Truth Answer: fun k => (k ^ 2 - 4) ^ 2 / (4 * k * (k ^ 2 + 4))
Proposed Answer: fun k : ℝ => 2 * (k^4 - 4 * k^2 + 2) / (k^3 - 2 * k)
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground truth: (k² - 4)² / (4k(k² + 4))
Proposed: 2(k⁴ - 4k² + 2)/(k³ - 2k)

First, let's expand the ground truth numerator:
(k² - 4)² = k⁴ - 8k² + 16

Now expand the proposed numerator:
2(k⁴ - 4k² + 2) = 2k⁴ - 8k² + 4

These are clearly different. Let's also examine the denominators:
Ground truth denominator: 4k(k² + 4) = 4k³ + 16k
Proposed denominator: k³ - 2k

Again, these are different. 

We can also test with specific values to confirm they're not equivalent:
For k=3:
Ground truth: (9-4)²/(4*3*(9+4)) = 25/156 ≈ 0.160256
Proposed: 2(81-36+2)/(27-6) = 2*47/21 ≈ 4.47619

The values are clearly different, confirming the answers are not equivalent.
