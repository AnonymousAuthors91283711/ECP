Ground Truth Answer: (19, 0, 1)
Proposed Answer: (0, 0, 5)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. From hwins: 2 + 7 + 6 + 10 + x = 25 → 25 + x = 25 → x = 0
2. From hlosses: 15 + 9 + 12 + 8 + y = 44 → 44 + y = 44 → y = 0
3. From hties: 3 + 4 + 2 + 2 + z = 11 → 11 + z = 11 → z = 0
4. But x + y + z = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 ≠ 20 (contradicts hx)

The ground truth answer (19, 0, 1):
- x=19: 25 + 19 = 44 ≠ 25 (wrong)
- y=0: 44 + 0 = 44 (correct)
- z=1: 11 + 1 = 12 ≠ 11 (wrong)
- Sum: 19+0+1=20 (correct)

The proposed answer (0, 0, 5):
- x=0: 25 + 0 = 25 (correct)
- y=0: 44 + 0 = 44 (correct)
- z=5: 11 + 5 = 16 ≠ 11 (wrong)
- Sum: 0+0+5=5 ≠ 20 (wrong)

Both answers are incorrect as they don't satisfy all equations. The ground truth fails hwins and hties, while the proposed answer fails hties and hx.
