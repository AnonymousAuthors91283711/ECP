Ground Truth Answer: 128
Proposed Answer: 78 + 5 * (15 - 5)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves binomial coefficients (Nat.choose) and establishes several equalities.
2. The key part we need to evaluate is the last equation: `a + b * (15 - b) = omnimath2487_answer`
3. From the problem statement:
   - `a` is defined as 78
   - `b` is defined as 5
4. The ground truth answer is 128
5. The proposed answer is `78 + 5 * (15 - 5)`

Now let's compute the proposed answer:
78 + 5 * (15 - 5) = 78 + 5 * 10 = 78 + 50 = 128

This exactly matches the ground truth answer of 128.
