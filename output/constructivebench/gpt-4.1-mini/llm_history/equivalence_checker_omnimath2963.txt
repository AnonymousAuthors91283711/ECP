theorem omnimath2963 :
  let ΩS : Finset ℕ := {1, 2, 3, 4}
  let ΩT : Finset ℕ := {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
  let outcomes := Finset.product ΩS ΩT

Ground Truth Answer: 1/4
Proposed Answer: 3/8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating the probability that s > t when s is drawn from {1,2,3,4} and t is drawn from {1,2,3,4,5,6}.

2. To find the count where s > t:
- When s=1: no t satisfies t<1 → 0 cases
- When s=2: t can be 1 → 1 case
- When s=3: t can be 1,2 → 2 cases
- When s=4: t can be 1,2,3 → 3 cases
Total favorable cases = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

3. Total possible outcomes = |ΩS| × |ΩT| = 4 × 6 = 24

4. Probability = favorable/total = 6/24 = 1/4

The ground truth answer (1/4) is correct, while the proposed answer (3/8) is incorrect.
