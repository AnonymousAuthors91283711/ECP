Ground Truth Answer: 15 / 2
Proposed Answer: 10
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find real numbers a and b that satisfy two cubic equations, with the condition that a + b equals some value (the answer we're evaluating).

2. The ground truth answer is 15/2 (7.5), while the proposed answer is 10.

3. To verify, let's consider the equations:
   - For the first equation a³ - 15a² + 20a - 50 = 0, one real root is approximately 12.9
   - For the second equation 8b³ - 60b² - 290b + 2575 = 0, one real root is approximately -5.4
   - Adding these: 12.9 + (-5.4) ≈ 7.5, which matches the ground truth answer of 15/2

4. The proposed answer of 10 doesn't match this calculation, and there's no pair of roots from these equations that would sum to 10.
