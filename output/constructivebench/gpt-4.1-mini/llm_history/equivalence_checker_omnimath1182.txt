Ground Truth Answer: 327680 * 2 ^ 16
Proposed Answer: 17 ^ (17 / 2)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum possible determinant of a 17×17 matrix with entries ±1.

2. The ground truth answer (327680 * 2^16) is correct and well-known in mathematics. It comes from Hadamard's maximum determinant problem, where the maximum determinant for an n×n matrix with entries ±1 is known to be n^(n/2) for certain n, but for n=17, the exact maximum is known to be 327680 * 2^16.

3. The proposed answer (17^(17/2)) would be correct if 17 was a number where a Hadamard matrix exists (which it doesn't). This is an upper bound (Hadamard's bound), but not the exact maximum.

4. For n=17, 17^(17/2) ≈ 1.67×10^14 while the actual maximum is 327680 * 2^16 ≈ 2.15×10^10, so they're not equal.
