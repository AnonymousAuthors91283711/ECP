The issue arises because the fraction `-1 / 16` in Lean defaults to integer division which is not computable in the reals without marking the definition as noncomputable. To fix this, we either mark the definition `noncomputable` or explicitly express the real number division by using `Real.ofNat` and `Real.mkRat` or use the rational number cast. A simple fix is to write the fraction in terms of `-(1 / 16 : ℝ)` or use `(1 : ℝ) / 16` with proper parentheses.

Here is a minimal working fix by using `(-1 : ℝ) / 16` to ensure it is the real division, which Lean can accept without marking noncomputable.

The error you encountered is typical in Lean when defining constants involving real division (`/`), because it requires the definition to be computable or marked as `noncomputable`. Since your value `(-1 : ℝ) / 16` is a real number with division, Lean needs you to either define it as `noncomputable` or avoid the division in the definition.

A straightforward fix is to mark the abbreviation as `noncomputable`, which is entirely acceptable since this is a constant real number and would just delay the computability requirements until runtime (or when needed).

Therefore, the fixed answer is:

The error message indicates that Lean cannot compile the definition because it depends on noncomputable parts of the real number structure (like division on reals) and no executable code can be generated. To fix this, we should mark the definition as `noncomputable`, which is standard in Lean when working with real numbers and analytical expressions that do not have direct computational content.

Therefore, adding `noncomputable` before `abbrev` will solve the error.

The correct definition is:
