Ground Truth Answer: 24
Proposed Answer: 16
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n > 1 where the product of its divisors equals n^4.

2. For any number n with k divisors, the product of its divisors is n^(k/2).

3. Therefore, we need n^(k/2) = n^4 ⇒ k/2 = 4 ⇒ k = 8.

4. We need to find the smallest n > 1 with exactly 8 divisors.

5. Ground truth answer is 24:
   - Divisors of 24: 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24 (8 divisors)
   - Product: 1×2×3×4×6×8×12×24 = 331776 = 24^4

6. Proposed answer is 16:
   - Divisors of 16: 1,2,4,8,16 (5 divisors)
   - Product: 1×2×4×8×16 = 1024 ≠ 16^4 (65536)
   - Also, 5 ≠ 8 divisors

The proposed answer (16) is incorrect because:
- It doesn't have 8 divisors
- The product of its divisors doesn't equal 16^4
- 24 is indeed the smallest number satisfying the condition
