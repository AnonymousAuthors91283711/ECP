Ground Truth Answer: fun a b c => (1 / (a + 1)) + (1 / (b + 1)) + (1 / (c + 1))
Proposed Answer: fun a b c => a + b + c
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a cubic equation (X-a)(X-b)(X-c) = X³ - X + 1, which means a, b, c are roots of X³ - X + 1 = 0.

2. From Vieta's formulas, we know:
   - a + b + c = 0 (coefficient of X² is 0)
   - ab + bc + ca = -1
   - abc = -1

3. The ground truth answer computes the sum of reciprocals of (a+1), (b+1), (c+1).

4. The proposed answer simply computes a + b + c, which we know equals 0 from Vieta's formulas, not -2 as required by the theorem.

The proposed answer is clearly different from the ground truth answer and doesn't satisfy the theorem's requirement of equaling -2.
