Ground Truth Answer: 20
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the cardinality of the set of non-negative integers k such that there exist integers c,d where c + d = 2000 and c = k*d.

2. We can rewrite the conditions:
   - c = k*d
   - c + d = 2000 ⇒ k*d + d = 2000 ⇒ d(k + 1) = 2000 ⇒ d = 2000/(k + 1)
   - For d to be integer, (k + 1) must be a divisor of 2000

3. The number of positive divisors of 2000 is:
   - 2000 = 2^4 * 5^3
   - Number of divisors = (4+1)(3+1) = 20

4. Each divisor m corresponds to k = m - 1, giving us 20 possible non-negative integer values for k.

The ground truth answer (20) correctly counts all possible divisors, while the proposed answer (2) is incorrect.
