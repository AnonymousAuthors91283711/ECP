Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: fib 2003
Let me analyze this problem and the answers carefully.

The problem is about the Fibonacci sequence and asks us to find the simplified form of the expression (f2003/f2002 - f2004/f2003), where f2002, f2003, f2004 are Fibonacci numbers.

Key observations:
1. Using the Fibonacci recurrence relation: f2004 = f2003 + f2002
2. The expression simplifies to: (f2003² - f2002*f2004)/(f2002*f2003)
3. Substituting f2004: (f2003² - f2002*(f2003 + f2002))/(f2002*f2003) = (-f2002²)/(f2002*f2003) = -f2002/f2003
4. The simplified rational is -f2002/f2003
5. The numerator's absolute value is f2002, denominator is f2003
6. The problem asks for d where Coprime(|num|, d) and den = d
7. Since Fibonacci numbers are pairwise coprime (gcd(f2002, f2003) = 1), the denominator d should indeed be f2003

The ground truth answer is 1, but the proposed answer is fib 2003. Based on the analysis:
- The numerator's absolute value is fib 2002
- The denominator is fib 2003
- They are coprime
- Therefore, the denominator d should be fib 2003, not 1

The ground truth answer appears incorrect, while the proposed answer is correct.
