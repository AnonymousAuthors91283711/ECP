Ground Truth Answer: 1/2
Proposed Answer: 3/4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting pairs (p₁, p₂) where p₁ ∈ Fin 8 (values 0-7) and p₂ ∈ Fin 6 (values 0-5) such that 3 divides (p₁+1)(p₂+1).

2. For the ground truth answer of 1/2:
- Total possible pairs: 8 × 6 = 48
- We need to count pairs where (x+1)(y+1) ≡ 0 mod 3 (where x ∈ 0-7, y ∈ 0-5)
- This occurs when either x+1 ≡ 0 mod 3 or y+1 ≡ 0 mod 3
- x+1 ≡ 0 mod 3 when x ∈ {2,5} (2/8 of cases)
- y+1 ≡ 0 mod 3 when y ∈ {2} (1/6 of cases)
- Using inclusion-exclusion: probability = 2/8 + 1/6 - (2/8)(1/6) = 1/4 + 1/6 - 1/24 = 6/24 + 4/24 - 1/24 = 9/24 = 3/8
- Wait, this contradicts the ground truth answer, suggesting the ground truth might be incorrect

3. The proposed answer is 3/4, which seems too high since even if all y-values worked with some x-values, the maximum would be less than this.

4. Let's calculate more carefully:
- Total valid pairs:
  - When x ∈ {2,5} (2 options), any y works (6 options) → 2×6 = 12
  - When x ∉ {2,5} (6 options), only y=2 works (1 option) → 6×1 = 6
  - Total valid pairs = 12 + 6 = 18
  - Probability = 18/48 = 3/8

Both answers seem incorrect based on this calculation. However, the proposed answer (3/4) is further from the correct value (3/8) than the ground truth (1/2).
