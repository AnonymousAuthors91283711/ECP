theorem omnimath1356 : 
  (∑ i in Finset.range 2016, 2^i / 25) % 100 = omnimath1356_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sum inside is ∑_{i=0}^{2015} 2^i / 25. Since division here is integer division, each term 2^i/25 is floor(2^i/25). Modulo 100 requires finding the sum modulo 100.

Using properties of modulo and sums of powers:

Sum over i of floor(2^i/25) mod 100 = ?

Since 2^i mod (25*100)=2^i mod 2500 repeats every 100 terms (order of 2 mod 25 is 20, but since 25 and 100 factor in, better to rely on the computer enumerated answer).

Given the type and problem format, the intended answer is an explicit natural number.
