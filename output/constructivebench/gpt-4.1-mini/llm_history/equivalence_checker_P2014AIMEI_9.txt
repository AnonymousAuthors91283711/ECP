Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: (2014 : ℝ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives a cubic polynomial in terms of its roots x₁ < x₂ < x₃.
2. The polynomial is: √2014 * x³ - 4029 * x² + 2 = (x - x₁)(x - x₂)(x - x₃)
3. We're asked to find the value of x₂(x₁ + x₃)

Key observations:
- Expanding the right side gives: x³ - (x₁+x₂+x₃)x² + (x₁x₂ + x₁x₃ + x₂x₃)x - x₁x₂x₃
- Comparing coefficients with the left side:
  - Sum of roots: x₁ + x₂ + x₃ = 4029/√2014
  - Sum of product of roots two at a time: x₁x₂ + x₁x₃ + x₂x₃ = 0
  - Product of roots: x₁x₂x₃ = -2/√2014

We need to find x₂(x₁ + x₃). From the sum of roots, we know x₁ + x₃ = (4029/√2014) - x₂.

From the sum of products two at a time:
x₁x₂ + x₁x₃ + x₂x₃ = x₂(x₁ + x₃) + x₁x₃ = 0
But we don't have a direct expression for x₁x₃.

However, the ground truth answer is 2, which is a simple constant, while the proposed answer is 2014. These are clearly different values.
