theorem olympiadbench2266 (r : ℝ) :
    (∃ d : ℝ, 4 + d = 4 * r ∧ 4 * r + d = 4 * r^2) ↔ r ∈ olympiadbench2266_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {1}
Proposed Answer: {r | r = 2}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all real numbers r for which there exists a real number d satisfying:
   - 4 + d = 4r
   - 4r + d = 4r²

2. Let's solve the system:
   From the first equation: d = 4r - 4
   Substitute into second equation: 4r + (4r - 4) = 4r²
   Simplify: 8r - 4 = 4r²
   Rearrange: 4r² - 8r + 4 = 0
   Simplify: r² - 2r + 1 = 0
   Factor: (r - 1)² = 0
   Solution: r = 1

3. The ground truth answer is {1}, which matches our solution.

4. The proposed answer is {r | r = 2}, which is incorrect as it gives a different solution.

<<<False>>>
