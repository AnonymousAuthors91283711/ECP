Ground Truth Answer: 441
Proposed Answer: 45
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating a probability involving Terry and Mary drawing marbles from an urn with 10 red and 10 blue marbles (20 total).

2. The probability is computed as the sum of three scenarios:
   - Both draw 2 red marbles
   - Both draw 1 red and 1 blue
   - Both draw 2 blue marbles

3. The ground truth answer is 441 (which would represent m+n where the probability is m/n in simplest form).

4. The proposed answer is 45, which is significantly smaller than 441.

5. Calculating the actual probability:
   - The denominator should be (20C2 * 18C2) = 190 * 153 = 29070
   - The numerator would be (45*28 + 100*64 + 45*28) = 1260 + 6400 + 1260 = 8920
   - Simplifying 8920/29070 gives 892/2907
   - 892 + 2907 = 3799, not matching either answer
   - However, if we consider the problem might be asking for something else, the ground truth 441 seems more plausible as it's a perfect square (21^2) which often appears in probability problems.

The proposed answer 45 is incorrect as it doesn't match the ground truth or the actual calculation.
