theorem omnimath2323 (a b c : ℝ) :
  (a^2 + 2*b^2 - 2*b*c = 16 ∧ 2*a*b - c^2 = 16) ↔ (a, b, c) ∈ omnimath2323_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(4, 4, 4), (-4, -4, -4)}
Proposed Answer: { (a, b, c) | ∃ k : ℝ, a = 2 * k ∧ b = 2 ∧ c = -2 * k }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives two equations:
   - a² + 2b² - 2bc = 16
   - 2ab - c² = 16

2. Ground truth gives two specific solutions: (4,4,4) and (-4,-4,-4)

3. Proposed answer suggests a parametric solution where:
   - a = 2k
   - b = 2 (constant)
   - c = -2k

Let's test if the proposed solution satisfies the original equations:

For the proposed solution:
1. First equation: (2k)² + 2(2)² - 2(2)(-2k) = 4k² + 8 + 8k = 16 → 4k² + 8k - 8 = 0 → k² + 2k - 2 = 0
   Solutions: k = -1 ± √3 (two real solutions)

2. Second equation: 2(2k)(2) - (-2k)² = 8k - 4k² = 16 → 4k² - 8k + 16 = 0 → k² - 2k + 4 = 0
   Discriminant: 4 - 16 = -12 → No real solutions

This means the proposed solution doesn't satisfy both equations simultaneously for any real k.

The ground truth solutions do satisfy both equations:
For (4,4,4):
1. 16 + 32 - 32 = 16 ✓
2. 32 - 16 = 16 ✓

For (-4,-4,-4):
1. 16 + 32 - 32 = 16 ✓
2. 32 - 16 = 16 ✓

<<<False>>>
