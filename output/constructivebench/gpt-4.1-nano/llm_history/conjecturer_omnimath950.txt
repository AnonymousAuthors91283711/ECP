Because the problem involves an injective function from a 100-element set to a product of smaller finite sets, with conditions relating indices and outputs, the structure resembles partitions based on the second component with adjacency constraints. Summing possibilities over the second component (size 50) and considering the injectivity limits, the total count aligns with placing 100 elements into pairs with possible adjacency relations. The pattern suggests the total count is the sum over arrangements like powers of 2 times combinatorial factors. The enumeration hints at \(2^{98}\), representing a binary choice for each of the 98 elements after fixing initial placements.
