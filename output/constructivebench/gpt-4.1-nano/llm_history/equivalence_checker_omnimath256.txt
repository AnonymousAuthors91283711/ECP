Ground Truth Answer: {p | let (a, b) := p; |a| = |b|}
Proposed Answer: { (a, b) : ℤ × ℤ | a + b = 0 }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all pairs (a,b) where there exist functions f,g: ℤ→ℤ such that:
   - f(g(x)) = x + a
   - g(f(x)) = x + b
   for all integers x.

2. Ground Truth Answer says |a| = |b|
3. Proposed Answer says a + b = 0

The key observations:
- The functional equations imply that f and g must be bijections
- The composition f∘g is translation by a
- The composition g∘f is translation by b
- For such functions to exist, the translations must be inverses of each other, meaning a = -b
- This is exactly the condition a + b = 0
- The condition |a| = |b| is more general (allowing a = b = 0 or a = b ≠ 0, etc.)

The proposed answer is strictly stronger than the ground truth. The correct condition is indeed a + b = 0, which implies |a| = |b| but not vice versa. For example, (2,2) satisfies |a|=|b| but not a+b=0, and no such functions f,g exist for (2,2).
