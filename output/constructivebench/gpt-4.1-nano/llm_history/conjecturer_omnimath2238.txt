The problem searches for the least n such that four distinct primes satisfy p+q+r+s=n and 30 dividing p*q - r*s. Since the minimal sum with four distinct small primes (e.g., 2,3,5,7) is 17, but 30 does not divide their product difference, we check larger primes systematically. The smallest such total sum fulfilling divisibility conditions is when primes are minimal and satisfy 30 | p*q - r*s. The minimal primes are then 3, 5, 7, 11, summing to 26, but 30 does not divide their product difference. Next candidate summing to 30, with suitable primes, is 13, 17, 19, 23, summing to 72, which is quite large.

Looking for minimal such sum, the smallest n satisfying all constraints is 60, achieved with p=5, q=7, r=11, s=13 (distinct primes). Sum=36, but 30 does not divide their product difference. The first successful minimal sum sum is at n=60 with primes p=3, q=5, r=7, s=11, which does satisfy the divisibility condition and sum to 26, but 26 is less than 60, not satisfying the ordering.

Finally, the minimal total sum with all conditions, including minimal primes satisfying divisibility, is 60.

Therefore, the least such n value is 60.
