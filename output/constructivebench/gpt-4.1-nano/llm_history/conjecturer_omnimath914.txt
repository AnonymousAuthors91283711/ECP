Given the pattern, the problem involves values of a where the sequence a^(2^n) mod 100 stabilizes after some N, indicating a finite cyclic behavior related to the order of a modulo 100. The set of such a includes numbers that are coprime to 100 or divisible by smaller powers, which stabilize their powers mod 100. The total count of such terms is often derived from Euler's totient or divisibility considerations. The enumerated answers suggest a simple multiple related to powers of 2, leading to the conclusion that the set's size is 25.
