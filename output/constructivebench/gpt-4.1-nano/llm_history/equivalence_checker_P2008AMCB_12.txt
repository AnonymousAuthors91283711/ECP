Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 2 * n - 1
Proposed Answer: fun n => n * n
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem states that for a sequence seq, the average of the first n terms equals n for all n > 0.
2. The ground truth answer suggests the sequence is the odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, ... (2n-1)
3. The proposed answer suggests the sequence is perfect squares: 1, 4, 9, 16, ... (n²)

Let's test both sequences:

For ground truth (2n-1):
- Sum of first n terms = n² (sum of first n odd numbers)
- Average = n²/n = n (matches the condition)

For proposed answer (n²):
- Sum of first n terms = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6
- Average = (n+1)(2n+1)/6 ≠ n (doesn't match the condition)

The proposed answer clearly doesn't satisfy the given condition, while the ground truth does.
