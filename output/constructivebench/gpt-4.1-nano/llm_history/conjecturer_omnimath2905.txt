theorem omnimath2905 :
  (2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 6 = 5 * 6 * omnimath2905_answer * omnimath2905_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The given product on the left is \( 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5 \times 6 = 2160 \). Thus, \( 5 \times 6 \times \text{answer}^2 = 2160 \), so answer^2 = \( \frac{2160}{30} = 72 \). The answer is \(\sqrt{72} = 6 \sqrt{2}\), but in natural numbers, answer should be an integer approximation. Since 72 is not a perfect square, the value is \( \boxed{12} \). The pattern suggests the answer is the square root of 72. 

Answer in Lean: <<<12>>>
