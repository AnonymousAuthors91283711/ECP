From the pattern in enumerated answers and constraints, we seek the largest subset of {1,..,30} with pairwise sums not divisible by 5. A maximal such set resembles one that avoids sums like 5, 10, 15, etc., implying selecting numbers in residues to prevent sums divisible by 5.

By analyzing residue classes, choosing all numbers corresponding to a fixed residue mod 5 maximizes size, avoiding pairs summing to 0 mod 5. The largest such class within 1..30 (which contains exactly 6 elements per residue) gives size 6.

Final answer: numbers all sharing the same residue mod 5, with maximum size 6, e.g., choosing residue class 1:

<<<6>>>
