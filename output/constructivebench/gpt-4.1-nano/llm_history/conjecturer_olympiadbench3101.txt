theorem olympiadbench3101 (T x : ℝ) (hT : T = 11) :
    sqrt (20 + sqrt (T + x)) = 5 ↔ x = olympiadbench3101_answer T := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
Given the equation √(20 + √(T + x)) = 5, squaring both sides yields 20 + √(T + x) = 25, so √(T + x) = 5. Further squaring gives T + x = 25, and since T = 11, then x = 14. Therefore, the answer function is x = 14.
