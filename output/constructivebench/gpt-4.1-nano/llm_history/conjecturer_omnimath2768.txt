    (3 * x + 2 * y) - (3 * x - 2 * y) = omnimath2768_answer (x, y) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℤ × ℤ → ℤ
Given x = -2, y = -1, the expression simplifies to (3 * -2 + 2 * -1) - (3 * -2 - 2 * -1) = (-6 - 2) - (-6 + 2) = -8 - (-4) = -8 + 4 = -4. The pattern indicates the answer depends linearly on y, independent of x, specifically yielding -4 when y = -1. Generalizing, for any y: answer = -4.
