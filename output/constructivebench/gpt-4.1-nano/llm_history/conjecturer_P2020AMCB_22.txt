The answer appears to be the maximum value of the function \(f(t) = \frac{(2^t - 3t) t}{4^t}\). Since \(f(t)\) involves exponential decay terms with \(4^t\) in the denominator, the maximum occurs at a specific \(t\), and the limit at infinity approaches zero. For \(t\geq 0\), the maximum is at \(t=0\), where \(f(0)=0\). Analyzing the behavior for \(t>0\), the maximum occurs at \(t=1\), where \(f(1)= \frac{(2 - 3) \cdot 1}{4} = -\frac{1}{4}\). The supremum (and greatest) of the range is thus at \(t=0\), with value 0.
