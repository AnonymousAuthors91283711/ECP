  ¬ ∃ (a b c d e f : ℕ), Odd a ∧ Odd b ∧ Odd c ∧ Odd d ∧ Odd e ∧ Odd f ∧ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 + f^2 = 1986 
  ↔ omnimath4346_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Prop
The problem states there's no such six odd natural numbers with sum of their squares equal to 1986. The pattern suggests the answer asserts this impossibility directly. Given the enumeration, the final answer is likely a simple Prop indicating the non-existence of such numbers, which is true because the sum of six odd squares can't be 1986.
