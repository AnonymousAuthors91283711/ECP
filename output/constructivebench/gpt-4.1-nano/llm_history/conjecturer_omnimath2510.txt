The problem constrains functions f : Fin 10 → Fin 10 with a specific sum relation. Since the relation involves pairs (i, j) with i.val + j.val + 2 = 11, it restricts the sum f i + f j to 11. Based on these pairs, the structure enforces that the function corresponds to an involution with conditions reflecting sums to 11, leading to pairs (i, j) with i + j = 9, and fixed points for i = 4 or 5. The total number of functions satisfying the relation corresponds to pairing indices {0..9} in certain ways. 

This results in exactly 2 fixed points, and the remaining 4 pairs can be matched in permutations, leading to 2 fixed points and 4 involution pairs; hence total functions count: 2^5.
