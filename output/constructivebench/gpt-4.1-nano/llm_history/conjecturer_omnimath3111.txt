The set S is defined by a system involving x, y, z with quadratic relations. Eliminating variables leads to a quadratic in y, with sum of roots - (7 + z) determined by the relations. Solving yields roots y = 5 and y = 9; thus, their sum is 14. The negative sum is -14.

The problem involves finding two real numbers y₁, y₂ such that there exist real x, z satisfying the given relations, especially x + y = 7, x * z = -180, and (x + y + z)^2 = 4, and then expressing the negative sum - (y₁ + y₂) in closed form.

From the equations:
- y = 7 - x
- x * z = -180 ⇒ z = -180 / x
- (x + y + z)^2 = 4

Since y = 7 - x, the sum y₁ + y₂ is related to x and z, and the key is to relate the sum of y's to x and z or vice versa.

First, note that:
- x + y + z = (x + (7 - x) + z) = 7 + z
- The square: (7 + z)^2 = 4, so 7 + z = ±2

Thus, z = -7 + 2 = -5 or z= -7 - 2 = -9

Correspondingly:
- For z= -5, the relation x * z= -180 ⇒ x * (-5)= -180 ⇒ x=36
- For z= -9, x * (-9)= -180 ⇒ x=20

For each x, y=7 - x:
- When x=36, y= 7 -36 = -29
- When x=20, y= 7 -20 = -13

Then, y₁ and y₂ are these two values (-29 and -13), which satisfy the given relations.

Sum: y₁ + y₂ = -29 + (-13) = -42

Negated sum is then -(y₁ + y₂) = 42.

Since the sum is always -42, the closed-form answer is 42, regardless of the particular solution, because the sum of y₁ and y₂ is constant.

Considering the pattern from the enumerated answers, the expression for the answer is 42.

In Lean syntax:
- We define the answer as 42

Therefore, the correct final expression is:

<<<42>>>

which satisfies the requirement of being a closed-form real number (ℝ).
