Ground Truth Answer: 601
Proposed Answer: 302 * 301 / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem is asking for the number of triples (a, b, c) of natural numbers that satisfy a + b + c = 300.

2. This is a classic "stars and bars" combinatorics problem where we want to count the number of solutions to x₁ + x₂ + ... + x_k = n in non-negative integers.

3. For the equation a + b + c = 300, the number of solutions is C(300 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(302, 2) = 302*301/2 = 45,451.

4. However, the ground truth answer is given as 601, which is incorrect for this interpretation of the problem. The correct answer should indeed be 302*301/2.

5. There might be some misunderstanding here - perhaps the problem intended to count only ordered pairs where a ≤ b ≤ c, but even then the count would be different.

The proposed answer (302*301/2) is correct for counting all ordered triples of natural numbers summing to 300, while the ground truth answer (601) is incorrect for this interpretation.
