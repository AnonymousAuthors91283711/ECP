The problem asks for the minimal n such that a certain linear combination condition involving coprimality and congruences mod m holds for all functions a, b. Based on the pattern and the enumeration hint, it seems this minimal n is related to m and involves powers of 2, likely tied to the divisibility or the structure of the subspace.

Given that the minimal such n is generally 2^{m-1} for similar problems involving coprime conditions and linear algebra over finite fields, the most plausible closed-form is:

<<<fun m : ℕ => 2^(m - 1)>>>
