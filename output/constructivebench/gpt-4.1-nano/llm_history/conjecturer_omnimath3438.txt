: (5 * 5 + 5 * 5 + 5 * 5 + 5 * 5 + 5 * 5 = omnimath3438_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern in the enumerated answers suggests summing five instances of \(5 \times 5\), which equals \(5 \times 5 \times 5\). This simplifies to \(5^3\). Therefore, the answer is:

<<<5 ^ 3>>>
