The problem involves choosing a subset of triplets from an α×α×α space, with constraints to avoid matching the first coordinate of one element to the third coordinate of another. Since |α| = 16 and the condition prevents specific pairings, the maximal possible size is bounded by the total number of elements in α×α, which is 16×16=256, considering the restrictions. The pattern suggests that the maximal size is 256, corresponding to selecting all possible triplets without violating the condition.
