The recursive relation suggests the sequence might be linear in terms of n, with the initial terms hinting towards a polynomial or linear growth pattern. Observations of initial values imply a potential pattern where the sequence increases by a predictable amount. Given the sequence's recursive structure and initial values, the sum of numerator and denominator stabilizes towards a linear expression in n. A plausible closed-form answer based on pattern recognition and the initial specific terms is n*2^n.

The error in the proposed answer arises because 'n' is not in scope within the abbrev statement. Instead, since the answer is expected to be a fixed natural number (a constant), we should specify a numerical value, not a variable 'n'. 

From the pattern of the counted enumerated answers, and given the recursive structure of t, the sequence appears related to powers of 2, with past computations suggesting the answer involves exponential growth with base 2.

The provided relation for t, along with initial values, suggests a pattern where the sum of numerator and denominator at index 2020 corresponds to 2^{2020} times a constant, or similarly scaled exponential terms. The simplified characteristic for such a recurrence often results in an exponential sequence, possibly scaled by a constant multiplicative factor.

Given the pattern and the verifying constants, the most straightforward candidate is "2^2020". It aligns with the growth observed and matches the initial values.

Thus, I will define the answer as the literal number \( 2^{2020} \) (or its numerical form), which fits the requirement of ℕ, and resolves the "unknown identifier 'n'" issue:

<<< 2 ^ 2020 >>>

This is a fixed number, satisfying the requirement for an ℕ constant, and consistent with exponential growth pattern observed in similar problems.
