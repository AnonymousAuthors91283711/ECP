The recurrence relation resembles a second-order difference leading to a quadratic pattern, similar to Fibonacci-like sequences. The pattern suggests that the set includes integer values where \( n \) fits a quadratic formula solving the recurrence relation. Based on the pattern from enumerated answers, the closed form is when \( n \) is a perfect square shifted by some constant.
