Ground Truth Answer: -5 / 21
Proposed Answer: -8/7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives a polynomial P with two conditions:
   - P(1) = 1
   - A functional equation relating P(2x) and P(x+1) for x ≠ -7

2. The ground truth answer is -5/21 ≈ -0.238
3. The proposed answer is -8/7 ≈ -1.142

These are clearly different values. The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the functional equation when we test it with x = 0:
- P(-1) = -8/7 (proposed)
- P(0) would need to satisfy P(0)/P(1) = 8 - 56/7 = 0 ⇒ P(0) = 0
But then for x = -1:
P(-2)/P(0) would be undefined (division by zero), which contradicts the given condition.
