  ∃ (M : Matrix (Fin 3) (Fin 3) ℕ),
    (∀ i j, M i j ∈ Finset.Icc 1 9) ∧
    (∀ i j k l, i ≠ k ∨ j ≠ l → M i j ≠ M k l) ∧
    (∀ i j k l, Int.natAbs (M i j - M k l) = 1 → abs (i - k) + abs (j - l) = 1) ∧
    (M 0 0 + M 0 2 + M 2 0 + M 2 2 = 18) ∧
    M 1 1 = P2016AMCB_12_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The enumerated pattern suggests the answer is the sum of corner elements. The corners' sum is 18, and the middle is constrained to equal P2016AMCB_12_answer. Given the pattern, the sum of all edges (excluding the middle) matches 18 minus the middle value. Hence, the middle entry should be the median value, 5, for symmetry. Therefore, the answer is the total sum of relevant entries, totaling 18.

<<<18>>>
