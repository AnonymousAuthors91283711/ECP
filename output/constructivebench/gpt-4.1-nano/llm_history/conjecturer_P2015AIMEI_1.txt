  let A := ∑ k in Finset.range 20, (2 * k + 1) * (2 * k + 2) + 39
  let B := 1 + ∑ k in Finset.range 19, (2 * k + 2) * (2 * k + 3) + 38 * 39

The difference involves consecutive sums of quadratic-like expressions, which suggest a telescoping pattern. The pattern indicates the difference simplifies to a predictable polynomial expression in terms of the upper bound 20. By examining the pattern in enumerated answers, the answer appears to be 969.
