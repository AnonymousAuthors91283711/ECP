The pattern suggests summing the last two digits of each term's base powers modulo 100. Specifically, 4^k mod 100 cycles with period 2, 5^k with period 1 (always 25 or 5), 7^k with period 4. Summing these residues yields a consistent last two digits pattern. The computed sum's last two digits are 78.
