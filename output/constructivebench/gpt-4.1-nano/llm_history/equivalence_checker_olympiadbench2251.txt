Ground Truth Answer: 48
Proposed Answer: 16
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find the greatest two-digit number (n ∈ 10..99) where when you reverse its digits (10b + a), it equals 7/4 times the original number (10a + b).

2. The ground truth answer is 48:
   - For 48: a=4, b=8
   - Reversed is 84
   - 7/4 * 48 = 84
   - This satisfies the equation

3. The proposed answer is 16:
   - For 16: a=1, b=6
   - Reversed is 61
   - 7/4 * 16 = 28
   - 28 ≠ 61, so this doesn't satisfy the equation

The proposed answer (16) clearly doesn't satisfy the given condition, while the ground truth answer (48) does. They are not equivalent.
