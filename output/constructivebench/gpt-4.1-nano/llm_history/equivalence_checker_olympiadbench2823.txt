Ground Truth Answer: 820
Proposed Answer: 10 + 99 * 45
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

Problem Breakdown:
1. We need to find a natural number d such that:
   - a(a(2)) = 100
   - a(a(a(3))) equals some value (which the ground truth says is 820)
2. The function a is defined as a(n) = 10 + (n-1)*d

Solution Steps:
1. First calculate a(2) = 10 + (2-1)*d = 10 + d
2. Then a(a(2)) = a(10 + d) = 10 + (10 + d - 1)*d = 10 + (9 + d)*d
   Set this equal to 100: 10 + (9 + d)*d = 100 → (9 + d)*d = 90
   Solve for d: d² + 9d - 90 = 0 → d = 6 (since d must be natural)

Now check the proposed answer:
The proposed answer is "10 + 99 * 45" which equals 4465, which is completely different from the ground truth answer 820.

Calculating the correct value:
With d=6:
a(3) = 10 + 2*6 = 22
a(a(3)) = a(22) = 10 + 21*6 = 136
a(a(a(3))) = a(136) = 10 + 135*6 = 820 (matches ground truth)

The proposed answer doesn't match either the correct d value (6) or the final answer (820). It appears to be completely unrelated to the correct solution.
