Given the sum over k from 0 to 2^2014 - 1 of k^(k/2), the pattern suggests the sum involves powers of 2 and the structure of k's division by 2. Since the sum's terms are symmetric and the pattern in enumeration points toward the sum's relation to 2^{2015} (double the upper bound exponent), the conjectured sum simplifies to 2^{2015}.

<<<2^(2015)>>>
