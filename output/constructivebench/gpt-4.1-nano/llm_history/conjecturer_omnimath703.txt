Given the structure, it appears the minimal number of edges needed to connect such a 5-card subset s harmonizes with the minimal edge count for a connected graph with 5 vertices, plus additional edges between s and the remaining set. The internal subgraph among s must be connected, requiring at least 4 edges; edges between s and the complement set have no strict lower bound. Since the maximum number of edges within s is 10, and the filter divides edges into internal s and external t subnetworks, the minimal total edges to satisfy connectivity is 4.
