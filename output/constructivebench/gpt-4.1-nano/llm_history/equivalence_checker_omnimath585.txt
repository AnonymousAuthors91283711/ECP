Ground Truth Answer: 197/1820
Proposed Answer: (4 / 13 : ℚ)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about calculating the probability that a 13-card hand has:
   - Exactly 4 cards with value ≥10 (where cards are valued 0-12 per suit)
   - Total point value ≥13 (with Aces=4, Kings=3, Queens=2, Jacks=1)
   - Given that it already has exactly 4 cards ≥10

2. The ground truth answer is 197/1820 ≈ 0.10824

3. The proposed answer is 4/13 ≈ 0.30769

The proposed answer is significantly different from the ground truth answer (almost 3 times larger). The proposed answer seems to be making an incorrect assumption about the uniform distribution of high cards, without considering the specific point value constraint.
