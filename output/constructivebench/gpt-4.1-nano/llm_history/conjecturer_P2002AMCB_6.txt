The quadratic \(X^2 + c a X + c b\) has roots \(a, b\) when the polynomial evaluated at \(a, b\) yields zero. The roots are solutions to \(X^2 + c a X + c b = 0\). For the roots to be exactly \(a\) and \(b\), the polynomial must be proportional to \((X - a)(X - b) = X^2 - (a + b) X + a b\). Equate coefficients:

\[
c a = -(a + b) \quad \text{and} \quad c b = a b
\]

Thus,

\[
c = -\frac{a + b}{a} = \frac{a b}{b} = a b,
\]

so

\[
a b = - (a + b).
\]

Final set:

<<<{ (a, b) | a * b + a + b = 0 }>>>
