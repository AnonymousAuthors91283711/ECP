theorem omnimath3890 (D e h : ℕ) (hD : D > 0) (heq : e = 9 * h) 
  (h1 : 4 * (e + h) = 3 * e + D * h + 16) 
  (h2 : 3 * e + D * h = 3 * (D * e + 3 * h) / 2) :
  e + h = omnimath3890_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The key relations are e = 9h and 4(e + h) = 3e + D h + 16, with 3e + D h = 3(D e + 3 h)/2. Substituting e = 9h simplifies to derive D and find e + h. The pattern suggests the answer is 9h + h = 10h.  
Answer: <<<10>>>
