The problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that for any a, b with a * b = 10^n, either a or b contains the digit 0. Since 10^n = 2^n * 5^n, to avoid having a 0 digit, neither a nor b can contain the digit 0 in base 10. But 10^n always contains the digit 1 followed by n zeros, so n=1 is minimal.
