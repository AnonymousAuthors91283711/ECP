Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => π
Proposed Answer: fun a b => Real.pi / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves logarithmic equations with constraints on a and b.
2. From h1: log(a²) > 0 ⇒ 2log(a) > 0 ⇒ log(a) > 0
3. From h2: 2π * log(a²) = log(b⁴) ⇒ 2π * 2log(a) = 4log(b) ⇒ πlog(a) = log(b)
4. Therefore: log(b)/log(a) = π

The ground truth answer correctly shows that log(b)/log(a) = π based on the given conditions.

The proposed answer suggests π/2, which is exactly half of the correct value. This is incorrect based on the derivation.
