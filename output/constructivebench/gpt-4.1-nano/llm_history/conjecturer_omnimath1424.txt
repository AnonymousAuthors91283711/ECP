The expression combines factorials with decreasing arguments, weighted by constants, simplifying to a combination of factorials. The pattern suggests a sum connected to factorial ratios. Since the sum involves factorials of 9 down to 2, and considering common factorial identities, the expression sums to a value related to factorial 9 scaled by a constant.

The numerator 8 * factorial 9 / 4 simplifies to 2 * factorial 9, as 8 / 4 = 2.

Remaining terms involve factorials of lower order, which resemble parts of factorial expansions or sums, summing to 2 * factorial 9 + factorial 8 + factorial 6 + factorial 4 + 2.

However, to match the pattern of summing factorials with coefficients, the most plausible simplified total is 2 * factorial 9 + 2 * factorial 8 + 2 * factorial 7 + 2 * factorial 6 + 2 * factorial 5 + 2 * factorial 4 + 2 * factorial 3 + 2 * factorial 2.

But given the initial sum, the total simplifies directly to 2 * factorial 9 + factorial 8 + factorial 6 + factorial 4 + 2.

The main term: 8 * factorial 9 / 4 → 2 * factorial 9, matches to 2 * 362880 = 725760. The rest sum to small factorials, and overall, the total sum reduces to 2 * factorial 9 + other factorials.

The most consistent closed-form answer, given the pattern and initial data, is:

<<<2 * factorial 9 + factorial 8 + factorial 6 + factorial 4 + 2>>>
