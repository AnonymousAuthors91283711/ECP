Given the polynomial’s roots and their pattern, the roots are the 5th roots of unity scaled by certain constants. The polynomial factors over ℂ as a product of linear factors with roots corresponding to points on the unit circle scaled by 1. Thus, the explicit roots form the set of all scaled 5th roots of unity.
