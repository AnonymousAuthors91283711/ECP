The pattern suggests that the minimal clique size satisfying the properties is 3, and the maximum such size is n. The problem involves conditions that imply a regular structure with a clique of size 3, and the degrees sum constraint supports the lower bound. The logic points to the minimal k being 3, which is the smallest valid clique size in this context.
