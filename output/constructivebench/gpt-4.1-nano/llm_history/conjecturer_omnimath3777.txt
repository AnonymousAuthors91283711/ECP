Given the conditions, the largest such n occurs when k + m + 1 is minimized to 26 (since it's greater than 25), and p + q sums to that minimal value with p and q prime and not equal (like 13 + 13). Thus, the maximum n is achieved at m = 0, leading to n = k + 1. Setting p = 13, q = 13, sum = 26, gives k + 1 = 13 + 13 = 26, so k=25, n=26. For m=0, n=26 satisfies the properties. Testing larger n fails as for bigger m, k increases, but the prime sum can't stay fixed at 26 for bigger m.

So, the greatest n satisfying the properties is 26.

<<<26>>>
