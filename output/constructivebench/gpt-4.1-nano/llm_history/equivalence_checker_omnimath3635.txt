Ground Truth Answer: { p : ℕ × ℕ | p.1 ≤ p.2 + 1 ∧ p.1 > 0 ∧ p.2 > 0 }
Proposed Answer: {(m, n) | 1 ≤ m ∧ 1 ≤ n}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding pairs (m,n) where a certain injectivity condition holds for all Boolean functions on Fin(m*n).

2. The ground truth answer states that the condition holds when:
   - m ≤ n + 1
   - Both m and n are positive (m > 0 and n > 0)

3. The proposed answer states that the condition holds when:
   - Both m and n are at least 1 (m ≥ 1 and n ≥ 1)

The key difference is that the proposed answer doesn't include the m ≤ n + 1 constraint. This is a significant difference because:

- For m = n + 2, the ground truth says it shouldn't be in the set, but the proposed answer would include it
- The ground truth is more restrictive than the proposed answer

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
