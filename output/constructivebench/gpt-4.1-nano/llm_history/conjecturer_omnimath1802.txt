The functions described are Euclidean algorithms on natural numbers with bounds. The maximum number of steps corresponds to the worst-case scenario in repeated subtraction, akin to Fibonacci number ratios. The largest count is achieved when the inputs are Fibonacci numbers close to the bounds, giving approximately 13 for the maximum of these steps under the constraints.

Therefore, the closed form maximum answer for the greatest n is 13, captured by the function.

<<<13>>>
