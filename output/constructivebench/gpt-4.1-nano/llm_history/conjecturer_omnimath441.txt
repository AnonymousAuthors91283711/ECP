The pattern suggests the extremum is achieved when the distribution is concentrated equally, as in symmetric cases with constraints summing to 1. Since the expression involves terms with powers of x, and higher powers tend to decrease or increase given the weights, the maximizer likely uniform. For each n, the answer appears proportional to n times a constant factor. Based on enumeration, the optimal value is \(\frac{n}{60}\).
