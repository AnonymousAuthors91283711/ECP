theorem omnimath1234 : 
  let S := ∑ k in Finset.range 2009, if Even k then choose 2009 k else 0
  log 2 S = omnimath1234_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sum S includes only even k, so S = ∑_{k even} C(2009, k). Using binomial theorem, sum over all k is 2^{2009}, with alternating sum zero since 2009 is odd. The sum over even k equals the sum over odd k, so each is 2^{2008}. 

Answer: <<<2008>>>
