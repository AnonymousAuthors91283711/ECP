noncomputable abbrev omnimath3452_answer : Fin 3 → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3452 :
  (∀ i : Fin 3, omnimath3452_answer i < omnimath3452_answer (i + 1)) ∧
  (∀ x : ℝ, (x = Real.sqrt 2011 ∨ x = 2011 ∨ x = 2011 ^ 2) → (∃! i : Fin 3, x = omnimath3452_answer i)) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Fin 3 → ℝ
The sequence is strictly increasing and takes values at √2011, 2011, and 2011^2, with each number uniquely assigned to an index in Fin 3. The natural order maps √2011 < 2011 < 2011^2 and the sequence must reflect this increase.

<<<fun i => if i = 0 then Real.sqrt 2011 else if i = 1 then 2011 else 2011 ^ 2>>>
