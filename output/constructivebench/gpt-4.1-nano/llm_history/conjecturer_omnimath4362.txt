  omnimath4362_answer a₀ a₁ := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → Prop
Because the problem's structure and pattern from enumerated answers suggest a relation involving the ratio of a₀ and a₁, and given positivity and inequality, the simplified general form appears to be the property that relates their ratio. Specifically, the property ensures the relation holds for all positive a₀, a₁ with a₀ ≠ a₁, perhaps expressing their inequality as a difference scaled appropriately. 

Answer:
<<<fun a₀ a₁ => a₀ * a₁ ≠ 0 ∧ a₀ ≠ a₁>>>
