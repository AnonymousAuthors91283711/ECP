Based on symmetry and the enumerated set size, the set likely contains four specific tuples where pairwise sums are primes. The consistent pattern suggests the set includes four 4-tuples with elements such that all these sums are prime only for those tuples. Given the constraints and symmetry, a candidate set capturing such specific tuples would be:

. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The key issues are that the answer is meant to be a set of natural numbers, but the initial "candidate answer" is given as a set of tuples, which is incompatible. The problem involves certain 4-tuples of natural numbers that satisfy the prime sum conditions. However, the actual answer should be a set of natural numbers that likely encodes such tuples or their elements, perhaps through sums, or a particular subset satisfying the conditions.

Since the "enumerated answers" suggest a specific, finite subset of ℕ with size 4, and the pattern of sum-conditions involves pairs of elements, the simplest hypothesis is that the answer is a set of 4 elements, likely particular small primes or numbers that encode the tuples.

Given the symmetry and the expression, and noting the failure of trying to encode tuples directly, the final set might be the set of these specific numbers involved in the tuples, e.g., the set {1, 2, 3, 4}.

Therefore, our candidate "answer" should be a set of natural numbers, for example, {1, 2, 3, 4}, which matches the given answer pattern, fit the constraints, and is compatible with the expected type.

The correct Lean-form answer should be a set of natural numbers with size 4, encoding the pattern of elements involved in the tuples, possibly representing their smallest elements to satisfy the sum conditions for the pairs.

***Final answer:***

<<<{1, 2, 3, 4}>>>
