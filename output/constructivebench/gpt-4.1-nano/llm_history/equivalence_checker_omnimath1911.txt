  let A := card (Finset.univ : Finset (Sym2 (S ×ˢ S)))
  let B := card (Finset.univ : Finset (Sym2 S × Sym2 S))

Ground Truth Answer: 225
Proposed Answer: 21
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves combinatorics with finite sets and symmetric powers. It's calculating the difference between two cardinalities:
   - A: Cardinality of Sym2(S × S) where S = {1,...,6}
   - B: Cardinality of (Sym2 S × Sym2 S)

2. Calculating the ground truth:
   - |S| = 6
   - |S × S| = 36
   - |Sym2(S × S)| = 36*37/2 = 666 (unordered pairs)
   - |Sym2 S| = 6*7/2 = 21
   - |Sym2 S × Sym2 S| = 21*21 = 441
   - A - B = 666 - 441 = 225 (matches ground truth)

3. The proposed answer is 21, which is actually just |Sym2 S|, not the difference A - B.

The proposed answer is incorrect as it gives only one component (B's component) rather than the required difference. The calculations clearly show the correct difference should be 225.
