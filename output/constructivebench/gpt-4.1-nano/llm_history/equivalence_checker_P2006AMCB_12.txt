Ground Truth Answer: fun p => 4 * p
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℝ => -p
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem describes a quadratic function f(x) = ax² + bx + c with:
   - A maximum at x = p (vertex condition)
   - f(p) = p (vertex value condition)
   - f(0) = -p (y-intercept condition)

2. For a quadratic with maximum at p:
   - The derivative f'(p) = 0 ⇒ 2a*p + b = 0 ⇒ b = -2a*p
   - Since it's a maximum, a < 0

3. From f(p) = p ⇒ a*p² + b*p + c = p
   From f(0) = -p ⇒ c = -p

4. Substituting c = -p into the vertex equation:
   a*p² + b*p - p = p ⇒ a*p² + b*p = 2p

5. Using b = -2a*p from the derivative:
   a*p² + (-2a*p)*p = 2p ⇒ a*p² - 2a*p² = 2p ⇒ -a*p² = 2p ⇒ a = -2/p

6. Then b = -2a*p = -2*(-2/p)*p = 4

The ground truth answer correctly gives b = 4p (though actually b should be 4, as we see in the derivation - there might be a typo in the ground truth). The proposed answer gives b = -p, which is incorrect based on our derivation.
