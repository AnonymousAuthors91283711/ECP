The sequence sums indicate geometric progression. Using the sum formulas, we find that geometric n = 10 * r^n where r is the common ratio. Solving the sum equations yields r = 2, and geometric n = 10 * 2^n. Since m = geometric n and n < 20, the maximum m is at n=19: geometric 19 = 10 * 2^19.  
Final answer: <<< 2 ^ 19 * 10 >>>
