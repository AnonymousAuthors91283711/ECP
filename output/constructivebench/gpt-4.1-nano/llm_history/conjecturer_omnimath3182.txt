The problem involves finding the minimum sum \(a' + b'\) for positive integers satisfying \(45a' + b' = 2021\). Given the enumeration hints, the minimal sum occurs when \(a' = 1\), leading to \(b' = 2021 - 45 \times 1 = 1976\), and the sum is \(1 + 1976 = 1977\). Since increasing \(a'\) increases \(b'\)'s decrease preserving \(45a' + b' = 2021\), the minimum sum is when \(a' = 1\). 

Thus, the minimal sum function in terms of \(a\).
