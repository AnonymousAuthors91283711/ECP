theorem omnimath4407 (a : ℝ) (ha : 1 < a) :

Ground Truth Answer: fun a n => if n = 0 then 0 else (n : ℝ)^(-a) * (if Even n then 1 else -1)
Proposed Answer: fun a n => a^n / (a - 1)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
1. We need a function from ℝ×ℕ→ℝ that satisfies two conditions:
   - Boundedness: There exists a constant C bounding all outputs
   - Separation: For distinct i,j, |f(i)-f(j)|*|i-j|^a ≥ 1

Ground Truth Answer Analysis:
- For n=0: returns 0
- For n≠0: returns n^(-a) with alternating signs
- This satisfies:
  - Boundedness since n^(-a) → 0 as n→∞ (for a>1)
  - Separation condition holds due to careful sign alternation and decay rate

Proposed Answer Analysis:
- Returns a^n/(a-1)
- For a>1, this grows exponentially with n
- Fails boundedness condition (no C can bound a^n for all n)
- Separation condition also fails since differences grow too fast

Conclusion:
The proposed answer fails both conditions of the theorem, while the ground truth answer satisfies them. They are not equivalent.
