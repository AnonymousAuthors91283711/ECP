theorem olympiadbench3013 (x y z : ℝ) (hx : x > 0) (hy : y > 0) (hz : z > 0) :
  logb 4 x + logb 8 (y * z) = 2 ∧
  logb 4 y + logb 8 (x * z) = 4 ∧
  logb 4 z + logb 8 (x * y) = 5 ↔
  ∃ k : ℝ, x * y * z = 2^k ∧ k = olympiadbench3013_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests symmetry among x, y, z and the logs relate to powers of 2. Given the sums of logs and their relations, the solution for the product xyz is a power of 2. The sum of logs indicates specific additive relations; candidate is the combined power sum, leading to the conclusion that xyz = 2^k with k = 4.5.  
Thus, the answer is:
<<<(2^(9/2))>>>
