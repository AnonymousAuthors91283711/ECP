The given functional equation suggests comparing coefficients after expanding (x + a)(x + 8).

We get x^2 + (a + 8) x = x^2 + b x + 24,
which implies a + 8 = b and 24 = 0 (constant term, assuming no other constant term in the expansion).

Since the constant term is missing in the functional form, the only consistent solution is when 24 = 0, indicating the initial assumption.

Alternatively, the question seeks the sum a + b, which simplifies to (a) + (a + 8), i.e., 2a + 8.

But from the relation, a + 8 = b, so a + b = a + (a + 8) = 2a + 8.

Given the options, to find the specific value, note that the context suggests the constant term being 24, and the solution is that a + b equals 8.

Thus, the answer is 8.

<<<8>>>
