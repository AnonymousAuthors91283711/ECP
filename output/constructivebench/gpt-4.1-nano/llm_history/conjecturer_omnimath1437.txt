The pattern suggests the sum of pairwise products is a real number with magnitude √3, symmetric in a, b, c, and invariant under the given constraints. Given the symmetry and constraints, the value must be a real constant related to the roots of unity. Therefore, I conjecture the answer is a constant complex number with magnitude √3, e.g., \( -\frac{3}{2} \).
