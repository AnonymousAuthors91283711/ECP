Given the constraints x + 2y + 3z ≤ 8 and the expression n = x + 3y + 5z, the maximum value n can attain occurs at specific z levels, simplifying to n = x + 3y + 5z with x + 2y ≤ 8 - 3z. For each z between 0 and 2, choosing x and y to maximize n yields n_max(z) = (8 - 3z) + 3* (4 - 3z), leading to n_max(0)=20, n_max(1)=14, n_max(2)=8. The overall maximum is 20. 

Hence, the greatest such n is 20.

<<<20>>>
