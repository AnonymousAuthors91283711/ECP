  omnimath4170_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the constraints, the minimal number k for such a configuration is 1, since the set of 10 points can be arranged so that one point is closest to all rest, satisfying the minimal victim count. The minimal victim set size is thus 1.
