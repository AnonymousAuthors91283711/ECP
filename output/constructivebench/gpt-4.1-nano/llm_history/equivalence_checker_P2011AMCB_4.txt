Ground Truth Answer: 224
Proposed Answer: 23*7
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find two-digit numbers a (10 ≤ a < 100) and b such that:
   - When you reverse a's digits (e.g., 23 becomes 32) and multiply by b, you get 161
   - The product a × b equals the answer we're looking for

2. Ground truth answer is 224
3. Proposed answer is 23×7 (which equals 161)

Analysis:
- The proposed answer 23×7 = 161 is actually the result of the reversed digit multiplication (32×7 = 224), not the direct multiplication
- The correct answer should be the direct multiplication (23×7 = 161), but the ground truth shows 224
- This suggests the proposed answer is giving the factors (23 and 7) rather than the final product
- The actual answer should be the product of the original number and b (23×7 = 161), but the ground truth shows 224 which is the reversed product

Conclusion:
The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It provides the factors rather than the final answer
2. Even if we consider it as showing the calculation, it's showing the wrong product (should show 224, not 161)
