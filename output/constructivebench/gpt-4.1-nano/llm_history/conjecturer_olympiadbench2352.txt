Since \( x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{13}{6} \), then \( (x + \frac{1}{x})^2 = \frac{169}{36} \). Expanding: \( x^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = \frac{169}{36} \). Therefore, \( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = \frac{169}{36} - 2 = \frac{169}{36} - \frac{72}{36} = \frac{97}{36} \).

theorem olympiadbench2352 (x : ℚ) (h : x + 1/x = 13/6) :

Expanding: \( x^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = \frac{169}{36} \). Therefore, \( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = \frac{169}{36} - 2 = \frac{169}{36} - \frac{72}{36} = \frac{97}{36} \).

The core issue in the given Lean code is that the answer expression is defined as an abbrev with a "sorry" and then directly written as a narrative explanation, which is invalid syntax in Lean. For the code to compile, the answer should be an explicit expression of type ℚ, equal to the computed result \(\frac{97}{36}\). 

Given the algebraic reasoning: 

\[
(x + \frac{1}{x})^2 = \frac{169}{36}
\]

\[
x^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = \frac{169}{36}
\]

\[
x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = \frac{169}{36} - 2 = \frac{169}{36} - \frac{72}{36} = \frac{97}{36}
\]

the answer should be defined as:

```lean
abbrev olympiadbench2352_answer : ℚ := 97/36
```

and in the theorem statement, the proof should directly derive based on the given premise.

**Final fixed answer:**
