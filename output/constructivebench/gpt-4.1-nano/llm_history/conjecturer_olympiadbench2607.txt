The minimal k satisfying the conditions appears to be when g is linear with minimal slope 2, since for x,y>0, g x + g y > x^2 suggests g grows at least quadratically, but the minimal sum over range is achieved by a linear function g(n)=2n. Summing g(i+1) for i in 0..19 yields 2 * sum of 1..20, i.e., 2 * (20*21/2)= 420. 

Final answer: 
<<<20>>>
