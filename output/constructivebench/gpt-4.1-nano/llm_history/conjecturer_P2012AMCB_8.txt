The pattern suggests that the answer relates to counting sequences of length 7 with specific adjacency restrictions and a fixed value at the last position. As the last value is fixed to 0, and adjacent entries differ, the sequence counts are consistent with 3 choices per position (excluding the previous choice). The sequence can be viewed as sequences with 4 options for the first position, then at each subsequent position, choosing an option different from the previous, with the last position fixed to 0. Given this structure, the total count is 4 * 3^5.

Final answer expressed in Lean:
<<<4 * 3^5>>>

Explanation: 4 options initially; then 3 options each for the remaining 5 positions, fixed last value 0.
