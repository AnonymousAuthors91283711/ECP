Ground Truth Answer: ∅
Proposed Answer: {1}
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is asking for which positive natural numbers n can we partition the set {n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, n+5} into two triples with equal products.

2. The ground truth answer is the empty set ∅, meaning no such n exists where this partition is possible.

3. The proposed answer is {1}, suggesting that only n=1 satisfies this condition.

4. Let's test n=1:
   - The set is {1,2,3,4,5,6}
   - We need to find two triples with equal products
   - The possible products are:
     - 1*2*3=6
     - 1*2*4=8
     - 1*2*5=10
     - 1*2*6=12
     - etc.
   - No two distinct triples give the same product

Therefore, the proposed answer {1} is incorrect as n=1 doesn't satisfy the condition. The ground truth answer ∅ is correct.
