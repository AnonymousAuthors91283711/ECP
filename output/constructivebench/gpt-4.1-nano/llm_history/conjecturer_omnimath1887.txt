theorem omnimath1887 :
  ∃ (h p z : ℕ),
    2 * h + 3 * p + 6 * z = 800 ∧
    8 * h + 9 * p + 12 * z = 2018 ∧
    h + p + z = omnimath1887_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The equations form a linear system with two equations in three variables, suggesting the solution for \(h + p + z\) can be expressed as a specific function of these variables. Based on the pattern and the enumerated answers, the value appears to be consistent with the sum \(h + p + z\) satisfying conditions derived from the given linear equations, leading to the closed form involving linear combinations.

<<<(2018 - 2 * 800) / 6>>>
