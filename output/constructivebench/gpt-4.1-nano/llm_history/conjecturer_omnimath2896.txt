Given the set contains four elements {2d, 2ed, d², d(e + d)} with restrictions on d and e, the count of x satisfying the properties reduces to the number of non-duplicate elements under these constraints.

since d is odd, and e is even, all elements are distinct and their set size is 4.

Hence, the answer in terms of n is always 4.

<<<4>>>
