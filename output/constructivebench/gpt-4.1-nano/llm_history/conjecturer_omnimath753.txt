abbrev omnimath753_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath753 :
    {x : ℝ | x = ∑' n : ℕ, (-1) ^ (n + 1) * x ^ n} = omnimath753_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
Given the alternating geometric series, the sum converges to 1 / (1 + x) for |x| < 1. The set in question contains the sum of the series for various x; thus, the set of such sums is {1 / (1 + x) | |x| < 1}.  
Hence, the answer is <<< { y : ℝ | ∃ x : ℝ, |x| < 1 ∧ y = 1 / (1 + x) } >>>.
