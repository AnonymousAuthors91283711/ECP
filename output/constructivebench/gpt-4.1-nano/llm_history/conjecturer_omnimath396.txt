The problem involves finding the least positive integer c that can be written as the sum of two cubes twice, but not as a single sum of two cubes. The smallest such case occurs when c is the product of the sums, i.e., c = 1729, known as the Hardy–Ramanujan number, which factors as 1^3 + 12^3 and 9^3 + 10^3; neither is a straightforward cube sum itself. 

Thus, the minimal c with these properties is 1729.
