Ground Truth Answer: 5 / 4
Proposed Answer: 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives two conditions about a complex number z:
   - Its distance from 1 is 2 (|z - 1| = 2)
   - The distance of z² from 1 is 6 (|z² - 1| = 6)

2. The ground truth answer is 5/4 (1.25) for the real part of z.

3. The proposed answer is 1.

Analysis:
- The proposed answer 1 would mean z = 1 + bi (since |z-1| = 2 ⇒ b = ±2)
- But if z = 1 ± 2i, then z² = (1 - 4) ± 4i = -3 ± 4i
- Then |z² - 1| = | -4 ± 4i | = √(16 + 16) = √32 ≈ 5.66 ≠ 6
- The correct solution should satisfy both conditions simultaneously, which the ground truth 5/4 does, but 1 doesn't.

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect.
