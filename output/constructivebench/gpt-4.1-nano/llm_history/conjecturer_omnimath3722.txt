The pattern reflects the sum of squared digits equaling the number itself, which is characteristic of *Armstrong* (or Narcissistic) numbers in base 10. Known 3-digit Armstrong numbers are 1, 153, 370, 371, 407. The set includes these and all 1-digit numbers. Thus, the general set is all n such that n equals the sum of the squares of its digits, i.e., the Armstrong numbers. In Lean, the set can be expressed as those n where n equals the sum over digits^2:

<<<{ n : ℕ | (∑ d in (digits 10 n).toFinset, d^2) = n }>>>
