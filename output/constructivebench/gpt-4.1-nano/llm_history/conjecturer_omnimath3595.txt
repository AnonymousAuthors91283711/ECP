The pattern suggests the triples with positive integers (a, b, c) satisfying the divisibility conditions are characterized by the sum being prime and the sums a + b + c being prime with specific divisibility properties. The obvious candidate pattern is where each of (a + b), (b + c), and (c + a) are minimized and consistent with prime sum constraints, i.e., the minimal sum c=1, a=1, b=1, which yields a + b + c = 3 (prime); similarly, only symmetric or trivial arrangements work.

Therefore, the finite solutions are when (a, b, c) are all 1 and sum to 3, which is prime, with the divisibility conditions satisfied. Algebraically, this generalizes to the set where the sum is 3:

<<<{(a, b, c) : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ | a = 1 ∧ b = 1 ∧ c = 1}>>>
