Ground Truth Answer: {1331, 1728}
Proposed Answer: { n | ∃ m : ℤ, m ≠ 0 ∧ m % 10 ≠ 0 ∧ n = (10 * m) ^ 3 }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for natural numbers n that satisfy:
   - n is a perfect cube (k³ = n for some positive integer k)
   - n is not divisible by 10 (¬(10 ∣ n))
   - n/1000 is also a perfect cube (∃ m, m³ = n/1000)

2. Ground truth answer gives specific numbers: 1331 (11³) and 1728 (12³)
   - 1331/1000 = 1.331 which is not a perfect cube
   - 1728/1000 = 1.728 which is not a perfect cube
   (Note: There seems to be a misunderstanding here - the condition requires n/1000 to be a perfect cube of an integer)

3. Proposed answer describes numbers of the form (10*m)³ where m is not divisible by 10
   - These would be numbers like 1000 (10³), 8000 (20³), etc.
   - But these are all divisible by 1000, making n/1000 = m³ which satisfies the last condition
   - However, all these numbers are divisible by 10, violating the second condition

The proposed answer fails because:
- It includes numbers divisible by 10 (violating ¬(10 ∣ n))
- The ground truth answer appears incorrect as neither 1331 nor 1728 satisfy n/1000 being a perfect cube
- The correct answer should be numbers of form (10m)³ where m is not divisible by 10, but these violate the ¬(10 ∣ n) condition
