The pattern indicates the sum of products over a 2x2 matrix with total 2015, where each row and column product sums to 2015, suggesting a symmetric case with equal entries. Dividing 2015 equally yields entries close to 2015/2, but since entries are positive integers, the minimal sum occurs when they are as equal as possible.

Assuming the minimal total sum is achieved when the entries are balanced, the sum s is 2 * 2015 = 4030.

<<<2015 * 2>>>
