The pattern suggests the minimal k enforcing the given properties is related to the size constraints and the product 3000 ≤ n * m with n = m = 2011. Since 2011 is prime, the minimal covering set size corresponds to approximately the square root of 3000, which is roughly 55. For minimal sets, the smallest such k that covers all possibilities given the constraints is 55.
