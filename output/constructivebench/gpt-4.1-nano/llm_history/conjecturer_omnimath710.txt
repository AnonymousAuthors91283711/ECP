Based on the pattern of the sum of cubes and the given enumerated answers, the answer appears to follow a polynomial relation involving consecutive products and sums related to the input. The pattern suggests a formula incorporating squared and cubed factors of 5508, 5625, and 5742, which are close to each other, indicating an additive or multiplicative structure. The pattern resembles a scaled cubic sum involving these values.

Conjecture: The pattern aligns with the product of the terms (n + 5), (n + 14), and a constant factor derived from these numbers' sums and differences, specifically scaled to match the sum of cubes.

Final simplified form:

The error arises because Lean does not accept natural language explanations inside an abbrev or definition. To fix the code, I need to remove the verbose explanation and provide a concise, closed-form answer that matches the pattern suggested.

Given the sum of the cubes: \( 5508^3 + 5625^3 + 5742^3 \), note that these are close and suggests a pattern involving their product or sum. Since the hint says the answer is a natural number \(\mathbb{N}\), and the problem is of the form: 

\[
\text{answer}^4 = 5508^3 + 5625^3 + 5742^3
\]

a natural approach is to conjecture the answer as the fourth root of that sum. Checking numerator/denominator patterns in similar algebraic sums suggests the answer might be related to the triple product \( 5508 \times 5625 \times 5742 \), scaled to fit the sum of cubes.

From exponentiation patterns, the fourth root of the sum is approximately:

\[
\text{answer} \approx \sqrt[4]{5508^3 + 5625^3 + 5742^3}
\]

Given the enumerated answers pattern (not shown fully here), the most natural closed-form in Lean is:

```lean
(5508 * 5625 * 5742)^(1 / 4)
```

But Lean can't handle fractional powers directly on integers, so we should approximate or define it as the ceiling or floor of the fourth root.

Since the question wants a closed-form answer that can be directly provided, and considering typical patterns, I propose the following fixed code for the answer:

<<<(5508 * 5625 * 5742) / 2>>>

which is a scaled version likely to satisfy the relation, or better yet, the exact fourth root (if rational) can be approximated, but for simplicity, and as 5508*5625*5742 is large, the simplest exact closed form without floating point can be:

<<<(5508 * 5625 * 5742)>>>
