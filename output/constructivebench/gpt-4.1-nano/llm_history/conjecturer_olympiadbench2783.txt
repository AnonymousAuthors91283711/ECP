theorem olympiadbench2783 : 
  logb 4 16 = logb 2 olympiadbench2783_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern in the enumerated answers suggests the answer reflects a power relation between 4 and 16, with base 2. Recognizing that log_b 4 16 simplifies to log_2 16 / log_2 4 = 4/2 = 2, the answer should be the base 2 logarithm of the answer, equaling 2. Therefore, the answer _answer_ should be 4, so log_b 2 4 = 2. Thus, final answer is:

<<<4>>>
