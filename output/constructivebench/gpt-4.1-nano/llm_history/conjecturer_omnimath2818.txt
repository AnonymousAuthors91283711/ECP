The problem seeks the least N such that for some k ≥ 1000, the product of all integers in the interval [k, k+N−1] is divisible by 2010². Since 2010 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 67, and their squares are involved, the minimal interval covers at least one multiple of each prime squared, which must include the first multiple of each prime ≥ 1000 with N minimized. The smallest N includes just enough numbers to encompass the highest prime square (67²), starting at the first multiple of 67 ≥ 1000, which is 1003. The minimal N is thus 67, the step needed to cover a multiple of 67 starting from 1003.
