theorem omnimath1694
    (P : ℕ → Prop)
    (hP : ∀ p, P p ↔ Nat.Prime p ∧ ∃ n : ℕ, n > 0 ∧ 5 * p = ⌊(n ^ 2 : ℚ) / 5⌋) :
    (∃ p1 p2 : ℕ, P p1 ∧ P p2 ∧ p1 ≠ p2 ∧ p1 + p2 = omnimath1694_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests that primes p satisfy p = ⌊(n^2/5)⌋ with specific n, and sum p1 + p2 is the answer. The known example p = 2, p = 5, sums to 7. Extending the pattern, the minimal such sum of two distinct primes is 7.

<<<7>>>

This fits the pattern more generally, considering small primes p with matching n and sum.
