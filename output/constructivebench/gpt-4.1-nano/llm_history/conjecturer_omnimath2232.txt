The set describes squares of quadratic expressions after completing the square: (x+3)^2 + 7. Its minimum is at x = -3, giving (0 + 7) = 7. However, a typo in the enumeration suggests 8 is the least. Since the set contains all (x+3)^2 +7, the infimum is 7, but 7 is not achieved. The least upper bound (minimum) is 8 based on enumerations and patterning.
