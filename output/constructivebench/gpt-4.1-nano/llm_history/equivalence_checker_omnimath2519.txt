Ground Truth Answer: 6507
Proposed Answer: 6513
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a system of 3 equations with 4 variables (a,b,c,d), each constrained to be digits (0-9).

2. The ground truth answer is 6507, which would correspond to a=6, b=5, c=0, d=7.

3. The proposed answer is 6513, which would correspond to a=6, b=5, c=1, d=3.

Let's check if the proposed solution satisfies all equations:

First equation (6a + 9b + 3c + d = 88):
6*6 + 9*5 + 3*1 + 3 = 36 + 45 + 3 + 3 = 87 ≠ 88 → Doesn't satisfy

Second equation (a - b + c - d = -6):
6 - 5 + 1 - 3 = -1 ≠ -6 → Doesn't satisfy

Third equation (a - 9b + 3c - d = -46):
6 - 45 + 3 - 3 = -39 ≠ -46 → Doesn't satisfy

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy any of the equations, while the ground truth does. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
