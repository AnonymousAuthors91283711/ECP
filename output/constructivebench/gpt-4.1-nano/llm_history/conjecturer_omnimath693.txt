: ((((List.range 58).map (fun k => (580 - 10 * k)) ++ [9]).foldl (fun acc b => acc * b - 2) 1) % 100 = omnimath693_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests multiplying decreasing values from 580, decreasing by 10 each step, with an additional 9 at the end, then applying the operation. The fold computes as: ((…((1 * 580 - 2) * 570 - 2) * 560 - 2) ... * 9 - 2). The modulo 100 mainly affects the last steps, but for the pattern, the final contribution from the fold is influenced primarily by the last value 9, when modulo applied.  
Final answer: <<<9>>>>>
