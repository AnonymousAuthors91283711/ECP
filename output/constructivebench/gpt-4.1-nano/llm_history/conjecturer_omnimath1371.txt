The sequence follows the recurrence \(a_{n+2} = 6 a_n - a_{n+1}\) with initial condition \(a_0=1\). Solving characteristic equation yields roots \(3+\sqrt{8}\) and \(3-\sqrt{8}\). General solution is \(a_n = C_1 (3+\sqrt{8})^n + C_2 (3-\sqrt{8})^n\). Positivity implies \(C_2=0\); initial condition yields \(C_1=1\). So the sequence is \(a_n = (3+\sqrt{8})^n\). Therefore, the set comprises all real numbers \(x\) of the form \((3+\sqrt{8})^n\) for \(n \in ℕ\).

The core of the problem involves solving a second-order linear recurrence: a(n+2) = 6a(n) - a(n+1), with initial conditions a(0)=1, and positivity constraints a(n)>0 for all n, along with the requirement to represent the set of all possible values at n=2007 given any such sequence.

The recurrence resembles a characteristic polynomial with roots r = 3 + √8 and r = 3 - √8, since the quadratic is λ^2 + λ - 6 = 0 (obtained by rearranging the recurrence). These roots imply general solutions of the form:

a_n = A*(3 + √8)^n + B*(3 - √8)^n.

Positivity for all n suggests A > 0, B > 0 (or at least both non-negative), because (3 + √8)^n grows exponentially, while (3 - √8)^n tends to zero as n increases.

At n=0: a_0=1, which gives:

1 = A + B.

At n=2007, the sequence's value can be written as:

a_{2007} = A*(3 + √8)^{2007} + (1 - A)*(3 - √8)^{2007}.

Due to the positivity constraints and the magnitude of roots, the value of A varies in (0, 1), and the possible sequence values form the interval between the minimal and maximal sequences obtained when A approaches 0 or 1, respectively.

When A→1, the sequence is approximately A*(3 + √8)^n, so at n=2007, it tends to (3 + √8)^{2007}.

Similarly, when A→0, it tends to (3 - √8)^{2007}, which is positive but much smaller.

Thus, the set of possible values at n=2007 is exactly [ (3 - √8)^{2007}, (3 + √8)^{2007} ].

In Lean, we model this as all x in that interval:

{x | (3 - √8)^{2007} ≤ x ≤ (3 + √8)^{2007} }.

Including the positivity constraints and the general form, the set of all possible sequence values at n=2007 is exactly the interval between these two extremes.

Hence, the correct definition:

The primary issue with the proposed answer is that it's trying to define a set as a subset of ℝ using a comprehension, but the syntax is incorrect for Lean. Specifically,:
- In Lean, `{x | P x}` is syntactic sugar for `Set.of {x : ℝ | P x}` which expects `x` to be a variable, not a parameter or an expression.
- The expression `(3 - sqrt 8)^{2007}` is a constant but Lean needs to recognize it as an element of ℝ and properly specify the set based on these bounds.
- The syntax should be `x ∈ set` or expressed as a set of `x : ℝ` satisfying the condition.

Given the recurrence relation and initial conditions, the solution exhibits a pattern similar to solutions to linear recurrence relations, involving roots of the characteristic equation:
\[ r^2 - 6r + 1 = 0 \]
whose solutions are \( 3 \pm \sqrt{8} \).

The closed-form solution for the initial recurrence is:
\[ a_n = A (3 + \sqrt{8})^{n} + B (3 - \sqrt{8})^{n} \]
with constants \(A, B\) determined by initial conditions.

At \(n=0\):
\[ a_0 = A + B = 1 \]
and unknown relations follow from the recurrence. Observing the asymptotic behavior, the dominant part is \((3 + \sqrt{8})^n\), but the set of all possible \( a_n \) is contained within the interval bounded by these two exponential functions due to the positivity and recurrence structure.

Therefore, the set of all possible \(x\) satisfying the conditions for some initial sequence \(a'\) with the same recurrence and initial value is precisely the interval between these two exponential functions, for \( n = 2007 \).

Hence, the set can be expressed as:
```lean
{ x | (3 - sqrt 8)^(2007) ≤ x ∧ x ≤ (3 + sqrt 8)^(2007) }
```
properly embedded as a set of real numbers.

Final fixed version:

<<<{x ∈ ℝ | (3 - sqrt 8)^(2007) ≤ x ∧ x ≤ (3 + sqrt 8)^(2007)}>>>

This describes the set of all possible values `x` that fit the recurrence pattern, with bounds given by the exponential solutions corresponding to the roots of the characteristic polynomial.
