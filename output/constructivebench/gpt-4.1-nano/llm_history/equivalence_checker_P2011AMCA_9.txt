Ground Truth Answer: 441
Proposed Answer: (9 + 6) * (9 + 6 - 1) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem involves calculating handshakes between twins and triplets at a party. The ground truth answer (441) comes from a detailed calculation considering:
1. 9 sets of twins (18 people)
2. 6 sets of triplets (18 people)
3. Calculating handshakes within twins, within triplets, and between them

The proposed answer suggests using the combination formula (n choose 2) where n = 9 + 6 = 15, giving 15*14/2 = 105. This is incorrect because:
1. It counts groups (9 twins + 6 triplets = 15 groups) instead of individuals (36 people)
2. The actual calculation needs to consider handshakes between individuals, not between groups

The correct total number of people is 9*2 + 6*3 = 36, and if everyone shook hands with everyone else, it would be 36*35/2 = 630 handshakes. However, the problem has more complex constraints about who shakes hands with whom.
