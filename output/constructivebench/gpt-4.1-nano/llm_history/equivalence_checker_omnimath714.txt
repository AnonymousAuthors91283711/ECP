Ground Truth Answer: 2 / 3
Proposed Answer: (3/4 + 1/4) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about calculating the probability that a ratio c = a/(a+b) falls between 1/4 and 3/4, where (a,b) are uniformly distributed in the unit square [0,1]×[0,1].

2. The ground truth answer is 2/3 ≈ 0.666..., which is correct based on geometric probability calculations.

3. The proposed answer is (3/4 + 1/4)/2 = (1)/2 = 1/2 = 0.5, which is incorrect.

The proposed answer appears to be an incorrect averaging of the bounds without proper consideration of the probability distribution.

<<<False>>>
