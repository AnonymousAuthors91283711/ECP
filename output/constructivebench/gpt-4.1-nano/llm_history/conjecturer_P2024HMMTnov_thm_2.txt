The problem involves finding the smallest integer n ≥ 2 such that for all a, b with a + b = n, if a, b > 0, then either the sum of digits of a or of b is at least 7. By examining small cases, the critical point occurs when one part has a digit sum below 7, which typically happens with small numbers. When n ≥ 14, it is impossible to split n into positive parts both with digit sums less than 7. 

Therefore, the minimal such n is 14.
