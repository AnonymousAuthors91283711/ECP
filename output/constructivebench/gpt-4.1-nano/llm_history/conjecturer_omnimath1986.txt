The given factorial expression simplifies using binomial coefficient identities: \(\frac{(2016!)^2}{2015! \cdot 2017!}\).

Recognizing \(\frac{(2016!)}{2015!} = 2016\) and similarly for the denominator, the expression simplifies to \(2016 \times \frac{2016!}{2017!}\), which equals \(2016 \times \frac{1}{2017}\).

Thus, the simplified answer in ℚ form is \(\frac{2016}{2017}\).

theorem omnimath1986 :

Recognizing \(\frac{(2016!)}{2015!} = 2016\) and similarly for the denominator, the expression simplifies to \(2016 \times \frac{2016!}{2017!}\), which equals \(2016 \times \frac{1}{2017}\).

Thus, the simplified answer in ℚ form is \(\frac{2016}{2017}\).

The main issue in your current Lean code is that the `abbrev` definition is followed by a natural language comment, which is invalid syntax. Instead, the answer should be a Lean expression. Based on the simplification steps, the factorial expression reduces to \(\frac{2016}{2017}\) in ℚ.

The factorial ratio simplifies as:

\[
\frac{(2016!)^2}{2015! \cdot 2017!} = \frac{(2016 \times 2015! )^2}{2015! \times 2017 \times 2016!} = \frac{2016^2 \times (2015!)^2}{2015! \times 2017 \times 2016!}.
\]

Since \(2016! = 2016 \times 2015!\),

\[
\frac{(2016!)^2}{2015! \cdot 2017!} = \frac{2016^2 \times (2015!)^2}{2015! \times 2017 \times 2016 \times 2015!} = \frac{2016^2 \times (2015!)^2}{2017 \times 2016 \times (2015!)^2} = \frac{2016}{2017}.
\]

Thus, the expression reduces to \(\frac{2016}{2017}\). The correct Lean answer should directly encode this rational number.

**Final Answer:**

<<<(2016 : ℚ) / 2017>>>

This definition is a valid Lean expression, is consistent with the simplified mathematical derivation, and satisfies the problem's requirements.
