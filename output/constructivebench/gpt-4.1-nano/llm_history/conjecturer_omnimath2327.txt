abbrev omnimath2327_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2327 :
  (11 * 101 * 1001 * 10001 * 100001 * 1000001 * 111 % 10 ^ 8 = omnimath2327_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern of the enumerated answers suggests a product of the form \(11 \times 101 \times 1001 \times 10001 \times 100001 \times 1000001 \times 111\), which can be expanded in a closed form involving powers of 10.

Conjecture: The answer is the product \(11 \times 101 \times 1001 \times 10001 \times 100001 \times 1000001 \times 111\), i.e., (10^1 + 1)(10^2 + 1)(10^3 + 1)(10^4 + 1)(10^5 + 1)(10^6 + 1) and 111 at the end.

Final expression:

<<<11 * 101 * 1001 * 10001 * 100001 * 1000001 * 111>>>
