Ground Truth Answer: 2028
Proposed Answer: 2120
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n > 2023 such that the quadratic equation x² - 13x - n = 0 has integer solutions.

2. For a quadratic x² - T*x - n = 0 to have integer solutions, the discriminant must be a perfect square. The discriminant is D = T² + 4n = 169 + 4n.

3. We need D = k² for some integer k, so 4n = k² - 169 ⇒ n = (k² - 169)/4.

4. We need n > 2023 ⇒ k² > 2023*4 + 169 = 8261 ⇒ k ≥ 91 (since 90²=8100 and 91²=8281).

5. For k=91: n=(8281-169)/4=8112/4=2028
   For k=92: n=(8464-169)/4=8295/4=2073.75 (not integer)
   For k=93: n=(8649-169)/4=8480/4=2120

The smallest n > 2023 is indeed 2028 (when k=91). The proposed answer 2120 is the next valid solution (when k=93), but not the smallest one.
