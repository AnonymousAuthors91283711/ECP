Given the partition g=3×(total/9), y=4×(total/9), r=2×(total/9), and total divisible by 9, sum g+y+ r=total, thus total= g + y + r = (3+4+2)×(total/9) = 9×(total/9)=total. Therefore, total is divisible by 9, and the sum g + y + r confirms total=63 from given conditions; the proportional multiplier (total/9) is 7. Multiplying each ratio coefficient by 7 yields final values.

The main issue with the proposed answer is that `fun total => 63` is a function from `total` to `63`, i.e., a function `(ℕ → ℕ)`. But `abbrev omnimath3100_answer : ℕ := ` expects a `ℕ`, a specific number, not a function. 

Given the problem statements and the provided constraints, all variables `g`, `y`, and `r` are multiples of `total / 9`, and the total is divisible by 9. The specific values of `g`, `y`, and `r` are set such that their sum is 63, which aligns with `g + y + r = 63`. From the constraints:

- `g = 3 * (total / 9)`,
- `y = 4 * (total / 9)`,
- `r = 2 * (total / 9)`,

then `g + y + r = (3 + 4 + 2) * (total / 9) = 9 * (total / 9) = total`. Since this sum is 63, the total must be 63. 

Thus, the fixed answer in a concrete form should be `63`. The answer is a constant ℕ for the specific total satisfying the constraints, hence:

```lean
abbrev omnimath3100_answer : ℕ := 63
```

which is of type ℕ, satisfying the expected answer type. No function is necessary, since the question seems to ask for the total value satisfying the relations.

**Final proposed answer:**

The main issues are: 
1. Re-declaring the abbreviation with `abbrev` inside its own definition, which is invalid. 
2. The answer should be a closed-form numeral, not an abbreviation or a re-declaration.

Given the problem's constraints:
- \( g = 3 \times \frac{total}{9} = \frac{total}{3} \),
- \( y = 4 \times \frac{total}{9} = \frac{4 \times total}{9} \),
- \( r = 2 \times \frac{total}{9} = \frac{2 \times total}{9} \),
- and that \( total \) is divisible by 9,
- with \( g + y = 63 \),

we can verify:
\[
g + y = \frac{total}{3} + \frac{4 \times total}{9} = 63.
\]
Combine over a common denominator 9:
\[
\frac{3 \times total}{9} + \frac{4 \times total}{9} = 63,
\]
\[
\frac{(3 \times total) + (4 \times total)}{9} = 63,
\]
\[
\frac{7 \times total}{9} = 63,
\]
which gives
\[
7 \times total = 63 \times 9,
\]
\[
total = \frac{63 \times 9}{7} = 9 \times 9 = 81.
\]

Thus, from the fixed total, the answer for \( r \) (and also \( g \) and \( y \)) is:
\[
r = 2 \times \frac{total}{9} = 2 \times \frac{81}{9} = 2 \times 9 = 18.
\]

Final simplified answer:
<<<18>>>
