theorem omnimath2798 (x y : ℕ) (hxy : x * y = 24) (hdiff : x - y = 5) : x + y = omnimath2798_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The values for \(x\) and \(y\) satisfy:
\(x - y =5\) and \(xy=24\). Solving these yields \(x= y+5\), then \((y+5)y=24\), i.e., \(y^2+5y-24=0\).
Discriminant \(25+96=121\), so roots are \(\frac{-5 \pm 11}{2}\).
Valid \(y\) are \(\frac{6}{2}=3\) and \(\frac{-16}{2}=-8\).
Corresponding \(x\) are \(8\) and \(-3\).
Sum \(x + y\) in both cases is \(11\) and \(-11\).

Since \(x, y\) are natural numbers and \(x* y = 24\), the positive solution is \(x=8, y=3\):
Sum \(x + y=11\). 

Final answer:

<<<11>>>

This matches the enumerated answer.
