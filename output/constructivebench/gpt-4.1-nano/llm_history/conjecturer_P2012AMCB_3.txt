  ∃ c s : ℕ, 3 * c = 4 * s ∧ c = s + 4 ∧ 3 * c = P2012AMCB_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The given equations relate c and s, with c = s + 4 and 3c = 4s. Substituting c = s + 4 into 3c = 4s yields 3(s + 4) = 4s or 3s + 12 = 4s, so s = 12. Then c = s + 4 = 16. Calculating 3c gives 48. So the answer is 48. 

<<<48>>>
