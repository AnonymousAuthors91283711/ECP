The problem asks for the truth values of two statements about prime divisors within particular intervals. The first statement asserts the nonexistence of a large interval free of specific small primes dividing every number. The second asserts the existence of an interval where each number is divisible by some small prime. Based on the pattern, the first interval can be empty (False for the first part), and the second is true for the second part.

Final answer:
<<<(false, true)>>>
