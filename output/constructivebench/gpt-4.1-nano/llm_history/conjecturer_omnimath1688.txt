Given the iterative nature of f(x) = (x+1)^2 and g = f⁽²⁰⁰⁹⁾, the leading term after 2009 iterations resembles (x + (2^2009)), as the iteration increases the degree polynomial linearly. The highest degree term coefficient is 1, and the sum involves combinations summing to a binomial expansion pattern. The enumerated answers suggest the coefficient for the highest degree term dominates and is 1, with remaining sums adjusting lower order terms.

The key insight is recognizing that \(f(x) = (x + 1)^2\) and \(g = f^{(2009)}\) leads to \(g(x) = (x + 1)^{2^{2009}}\), because each application of \(f\) doubles the degree, starting from \(x\).

Given the pattern, \(g(x)\) expands as \((x + 1)^{2^{2009}}\). Since the theorem's goal involves expressing \(g(x)\) in a form combining \(x^{2^{2009}}\), a highest order term coefficient \(a(2^{2009} - 1)\), and a sum over lower order powers, the natural candidate is the binomial expansion \((x + 1)^{2^{2009}}\), which is:

\[
(x + 1)^{2^{2009}} = \sum_{i=0}^{2^{2009}} \binom{2^{2009}}{i} x^i
\]

Rearranged, the expression in the theorem's style shows:

\[
g(x) = x^{2^{2009}} + a(2^{2009} - 1) x^{2^{2009} - 1} + \sum_{i=0}^{2^{2009} - 2} a_i x^i
\]

where the leading coefficient is \(\binom{2^{2009}}{2^{2009}} = 1\), and the coefficient of \(x^{2^{2009}-1}\) is \(\binom{2^{2009}}{2^{2009}-1} = 2^{2009}\), because \(\binom{n}{n-1} = n\).

Matching the pattern: 

- \(a(2^{2009}-1) = 2^{2009}\),
- and the additional sum's coefficients are the remaining binomial coefficients.

Therefore, the answer \(a(2^{2009}-1)\) should be \(2^{2009}\), consistent with the dominant binomial coefficient.

Finally, the entire polynomial \(g(x)\) is:

\[
g(x) = (x+1)^{2^{2009}}.
\]

So, the flattened answer expression in Lean is:

<<<(2^{2009}) * (x + 1)^{2^{2009}}>>.

This makes sense given the binomial expansion, generalizes from the enumerated answer patterns, and adheres to the polynomial's structure.

---

**Summary**: The key conjecture is that iterating \(f(x) = (x+1)^2\) \(2009\) times produces \((x+1)^{2^{2009}}\). The coefficient \(a(2^{2009}-1)\) matches the binomial coefficient \(\binom{2^{2009}}{2^{2009}-1} = 2^{2009}\). The polynomial's form aligns with binomial expansion, leading straightforwardly to the fixed form in Lean.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
