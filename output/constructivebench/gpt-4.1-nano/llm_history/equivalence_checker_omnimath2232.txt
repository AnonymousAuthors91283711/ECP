Ground Truth Answer: 0
Proposed Answer: (8:ℝ)
Let's analyze this problem carefully:

1. The problem asks for the least value of the set {y | ∃ x, y = (x² + 6x + 2)²}, which means we need to find the minimum value of (x² + 6x + 2)² for real x.

2. To find the minimum, we can first find the minimum of the inner quadratic expression x² + 6x + 2.

3. The quadratic x² + 6x + 2 has its minimum at x = -b/(2a) = -6/2 = -3.

4. Evaluating at x = -3: (-3)² + 6*(-3) + 2 = 9 - 18 + 2 = -7.

5. However, we're squaring this result: (-7)² = 49.

6. But the ground truth answer is given as 0, which would require x² + 6x + 2 = 0 to have real solutions.

7. Checking the discriminant of x² + 6x + 2: D = 36 - 8 = 28 > 0, so there are indeed real roots where the expression equals 0.

8. Therefore, the minimum value of (x² + 6x + 2)² is indeed 0 (achieved at the roots of the quadratic).

9. The proposed answer is 8, which is incorrect.
