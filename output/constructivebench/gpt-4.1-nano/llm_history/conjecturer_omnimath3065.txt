abbrev omnimath3065_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3065 : 
  2 * 3 * 4 = 6 * omnimath3065_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests that the answer relates to the division of the product 2·3·4 by 6. Thus, the answer is (2·3·4)/6 = (24)/6 = 4. 

Following the pattern and ensuring the type matches ℕ: 

<<<(2 * 3 * 4) / 6>>>
