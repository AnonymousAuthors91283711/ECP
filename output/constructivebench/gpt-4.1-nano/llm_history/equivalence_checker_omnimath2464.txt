Ground Truth Answer: 55/2
Proposed Answer: 37.5
Let me analyze this problem carefully.

The problem involves evaluating a piecewise integral from 0 to 2. The integrand is:
- 50 * (1/2) when t ≤ 0.25
- (50 - 60*(t - 0.25)) * (1/2) when 0.25 < t ≤ 0.5
- 0 otherwise (when t > 0.5)

The integral can be broken down into three parts:
1. From 0 to 0.25: ∫ (50 * 1/2) dt = 25 * (0.25 - 0) = 6.25
2. From 0.25 to 0.5: ∫ (50 - 60*(t - 0.25)) * 1/2 dt = ∫ (25 - 30*(t - 0.25)) dt
   = [25t - 15(t - 0.25)²] from 0.25 to 0.5
   = (12.5 - 15*(0.25)²) - (6.25 - 0) = 12.5 - 0.9375 - 6.25 = 5.3125
3. From 0.5 to 2: ∫ 0 dt = 0

Total integral = 6.25 + 5.3125 = 11.5625 = 185/16 ≈ 11.5625

The ground truth answer is 55/2 = 27.5
The proposed answer is 37.5

Neither matches our calculation. The proposed answer (37.5) is significantly different from both our calculation and the ground truth answer (27.5).
