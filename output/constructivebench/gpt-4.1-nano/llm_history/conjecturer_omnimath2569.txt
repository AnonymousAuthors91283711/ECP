The pattern of the recurrence resembles combining sums over previous values with quadratic additions. Based on enumerations and the structure, the solution resembles the binomial expansion leading to quadratic terms summing to a cubic polynomial. 

Conclusion: the closed form appears to be a cubic polynomial in x and y, specifically (x+1)(y+1)(x+y+2)/2, which satisfies initial conditions and recurrence.
