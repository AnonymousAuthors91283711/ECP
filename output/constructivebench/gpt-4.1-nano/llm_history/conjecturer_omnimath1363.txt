The polynomial has degree 2010, with coefficients ±1, and the coefficient at degree 2010 equals 1. The remaining coefficients up to degree 2009 can be either -1 or 1, so the set of indices with coefficient -1 among degrees 0 to 2009 can vary. To maximize k, set all coefficients from degree 0 to 2009 to -1, giving 2009 as the maximum number of -1 coefficients, consistent with the given polynomial structure.
