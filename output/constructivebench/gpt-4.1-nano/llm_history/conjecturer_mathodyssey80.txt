The constraints form a feasible region for linear inequalities, and the expression 9x' + y' suggests a linear objective. The maximum value occurs at the intersection point of the boundary lines.

By solving the system:
2x - 5y = -6  
3x + 6y = 25

we find:
x = 7, y = 2

Plug into z = 9x + y:
z = 9*7 + 2 = 65

Thus, the answer is (x, y) = (7, 2), and z = 65.

<<<fun _ => 65>>>
