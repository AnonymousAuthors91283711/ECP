Given the constraints, the set S involves choosing numbers within 1 to 108 such that pairwise gcd with some element is 1, but for any pair, there's another element with gcd > 1 to both elements. The max such number fulfilling these conditions is 107, as 107 is prime and close to 108, ensuring the gcd conditions when paired with numbers like 2, 3, etc. 

<<<107>>>
