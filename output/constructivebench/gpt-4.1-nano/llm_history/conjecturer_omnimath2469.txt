theorem omnimath2469
: IsGreatest {2^(x*(1-x)) | x ∈ Set.Icc 0 1} (omnimath2469_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The function \(2^{x(1-x)}\) on \([0,1]\) is maximized at \(x = 1/2\), with the maximum value \(2^{(1/2)(1 - 1/2)} = 2^{1/4}\). Therefore, the greatest element of the set is \(2^{1/4}\).
<<<2^(1/4)>>>
