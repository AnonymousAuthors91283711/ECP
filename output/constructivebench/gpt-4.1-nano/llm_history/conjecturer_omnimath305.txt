theorem omnimath305 (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) :
  IsSquare (2^n + 12^n + 2011^n) ↔ n ∈ omnimath305_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests the expression becomes a perfect square when n is a multiple of 4, relating to the parity of exponents in sum of powers. Based on enumerations, the set includes n divisible by 4.
