The pattern suggests solving for x: x = 30°, since cos(40°) + sin(30°) = √3/2 ≈ cos(10°) (matching the formula). Given constraints 0 < x < 360°, the principal solution is x = 30°.

The error arises because in the set definition, the term `Real.cos 10 ∗ Real.pi / 180` is interpreted as multiple expressions without parentheses, leading to a syntax error. In Lean, multiplication and addition are left-associative, but to correctly parse the expression, we need to explicitly parenthesize composite operations involving constants and functions, especially when they involve multiple multiplications and divisions.

Given that the natural interpretation is `Real.cos(10 * Real.pi / 180)` and similarly for other terms, the correction involves adding parentheses around the arguments to `Real.cos` and `Real.sin`, and ensuring the constants are associated properly.

Furthermore, the answer set `{30}` should be written as a set of real numbers, i.e., include the decimal point as `{30.0}` to match the type `Set ℝ`.

**Conjecture**: The true value of `x` satisfying the given trigonometric equation in degrees is `30°`. The equivalent in radians is `π/6`. 

**Proposed form**: I output an explicit singleton set `{30.0}`, making sure the set syntax is correct and the syntax within the predicates is properly parenthesized.

. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The main issue in your attempted answer is the syntax of defining a set of ℝ with a membership predicate. In Lean, to define a set explicitly, you should use `{ x | condition }`, not `Set { ... }`. Also, the conditions involving `Real.cos` and `Real.sin` should have their arguments parenthesized explicitly to avoid parsing errors, as `Real.cos 10 * Real.pi / 180` without parentheses is ambiguous and likely invalid syntax.

Considering the mathematical problem, the given equation involves cosine and sine of angles in degrees, and the condition's solution appears to be `x = 30`. To specify this as an element of type ℝ, I'll write `30.0`. The entire set will hence be a singleton `{30.0}`.

**Conjecture**: The solution set is `{30.0}`.

**Final answer**:

<<<  { x | 0 < x ∧ x < 360 ∧ Real.sqrt 3 * Real.cos (10 * Real.pi / 180) = Real.cos (40 * Real.pi / 180) + Real.sin (x * Real.pi / 180) }  >>>

which, when concretely specifying the answer set, is:

<<< {30.0} >>>

This applies parentheses correctly around the arguments to `Real.cos` and `Real.sin`, ensuring proper syntax, and uses the correct Lean set notation for a singleton.
