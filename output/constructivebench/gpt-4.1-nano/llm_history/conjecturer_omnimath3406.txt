abbrev omnimath3406_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3406 :
  let apples := 12
  let bananas := 15 + 3
  bananas / (apples + bananas) = omnimath3406_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Based on the enumeration and pattern, the answer simplifies to the ratio of bananas over the total fruits: bananas / (apples + bananas). Substituting the values: 18 / (12 + 18) = 18 / 30 = 3 / 5. 

<<<(3 : ℚ) / 5>>>.
