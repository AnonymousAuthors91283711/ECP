  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ f n * 7 = g n * 4} P2021AIMEII_15_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests a recurrence relation leading to ratios of f n and g n, derived from the initial values and recursive formula. Solving the relation  \(f n = 2f(n-1) + g(n-1)\) with initial conditions yields a ratio  \(f n : g n = 2^n : 3^n\). The condition \(f n * 7 = g n * 4\) simplifies to \(7 * 2^n = 4 * 3^n\). The smallest n making this true with n > 0 is at \(n=1\), satisfying \(7 * 2 = 4 * 3\); no smaller n > 0 exists. Hence, answer is 1.
