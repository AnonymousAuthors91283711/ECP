Based on the enumeration for \( n \) between 1 and 30 with exactly two divisors \( d \) dividing both \( n \) and 80, the candidate numbers are those with exactly two common divisors with 80, i.e., numbers that share exactly two divisors with 80, typically prime factors or products with limited divisors. The prime divisors dividing 80 are 2 and 5, and their products with certain properties are candidates. After analysis, the valid \( n \) are 16 and 20, each with divisors exactly \(\{1, n\}\) sharing two divisors with 80. The answer is 2:
<<<2>>>
