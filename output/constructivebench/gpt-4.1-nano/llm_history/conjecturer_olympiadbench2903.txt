Since the prime values of |n^3 - 7n^2 + 13n - 6| over the interval, pattern suggests factors lead to primes only for specific n, likely 1,2,3,4,6. Finset filtering for these n, respectively, yield primes, numerators count these cases. The ratio simplifies to fixed fractions 1/2, 2/3, 1/3, 1/4, 1/6. For T=9, total numbers 18, numerator count primes at n=1,2,3,4,6: five points. Each contributes 1, total 5 over 18. The fraction is 5/18. Final answer: <<<fun T : ℕ => 5 / 18>>>
