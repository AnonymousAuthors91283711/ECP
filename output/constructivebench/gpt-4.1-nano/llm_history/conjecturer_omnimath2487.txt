The common value for all those binomial coefficients involving 3003 and the related parameters suggests the expression simplifies to 3003 multiplied by a constant factor. Given the patterns, the key value is the binomial coefficient with n=3003 and k=1, which is 3003. The combined expressions imply they are equal to this, and the sum of the parameters b and (15-b) and their interactions relate to the total. The final summation yields the main coefficient: 3003 × 1.
