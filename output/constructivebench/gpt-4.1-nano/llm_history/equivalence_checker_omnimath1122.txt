Ground Truth Answer: 20/81
Proposed Answer: (7 / 54) * (13 / 3)
Let's analyze both answers step by step.

1. First, let's compute the ground truth answer: 20/81 ≈ 0.24691358

2. Now let's compute the proposed answer:
   (7/54) * (13/3) = (7*13)/(54*3) = 91/162 ≈ 0.5617284

3. Comparing the two results:
   - 20/81 ≈ 0.2469
   - 91/162 ≈ 0.5617
   These are clearly different values.

4. Let's verify the calculation:
   - choose(6,4) = 15
   - The left expression becomes: 15*(2/3)^5*(1/3)^2 + 15*(1/3)^5*(2/3)^2
   - = 15*(32/243)*(1/9) + 15*(1/243)*(4/9)
   - = (480/2187) + (60/2187)
   - = 540/2187
   - = 20/81 (after simplifying by dividing numerator and denominator by 27)

The proposed answer (7/54)*(13/3) does not equal 20/81, and our verification confirms the ground truth is correct.
