Given the recursive relations and the constrained image of f (only elements in {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13}) with injectivity, the maximal value y is achieved when x is maximized and the sequence y (f 8) maximizes the sum along the structure. Based on the pattern, the maximal y corresponds to the maximum initial x plus the highest possible sum, which seems to be achieved with the sequence starting at 1 and increasing through the sum of the two previous terms. The pattern suggests y = 13, the largest element. 

Final expression:
<<<13>>>
