Given the pattern that the sum of powers involves specific ratios and the sum of the two numbers equals 67, and considering the reversely known identity involving the sum of 10th powers, a plausible candidate is (44, 23), which sum to 67 and are coprime, and fits the pattern of ratios involving powers of sine and cosine.
