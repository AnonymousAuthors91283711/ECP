Ground Truth Answer: 995 * 2^998
Proposed Answer: 0
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves permutations of Fin 999 (numbers 0 through 998) and defines two functions:
   - f(π) counts inversions (pairs where order is reversed by π)
   - g(π) counts fixed points modulo n (elements where π(k) ≡ k±1 mod n)

2. The sum involves (-1)^(f(π)+g(π)) over all permutations, which is essentially an alternating sum based on inversion count plus fixed point count modulo n.

3. The ground truth answer 995 * 2^998 suggests there's a specific combinatorial pattern where most terms cancel out, leaving a particular count.

4. The proposed answer 0 would imply perfect cancellation of all terms, which seems unlikely given the ground truth shows a non-zero result.

The proposed answer contradicts the ground truth, and the ground truth appears to be a specific, non-zero value derived from careful combinatorial analysis. Therefore:

<<<False>>>
