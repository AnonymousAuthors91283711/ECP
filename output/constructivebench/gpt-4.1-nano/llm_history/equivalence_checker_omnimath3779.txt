Ground Truth Answer: fun k => k + 1
Proposed Answer: fun k : ℕ => 2^(k - 1)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum size of a set S where a guessing strategy can perfectly match a binary sequence of length 2^k, with certain constraints.

2. The ground truth answer is k + 1, which suggests a linear relationship with k.

3. The proposed answer is 2^(k-1), which grows exponentially with k.

4. For small values of k:
   - When k=1: ground truth gives 2, proposed gives 1
   - When k=2: ground truth gives 3, proposed gives 2
   - When k=3: ground truth gives 4, proposed gives 4
   - When k=4: ground truth gives 5, proposed gives 8

5. The answers only match at k=3 and diverge elsewhere, with the proposed answer growing much faster.

The proposed exponential answer cannot be equivalent to the linear ground truth answer, as they have fundamentally different growth rates.
