theorem P2009AMCB_1 : 
  {b : ℕ | b ≤ 5 ∧ ∃ m : ℕ, 50 * (5 - b) + 75 * b = 100 * m} = {P2009AMCB_1_answer} := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests solving 50(5 - b) + 75b = 100m for b between 0 and 5, then finding m. Simplify as 250 - 50b + 75b = 100m → 250 + 25b = 100m. Possible b values yield b = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, with corresponding m as (250 + 25b)/100. Valid m are integers when 250 + 25b divisible by 100, which occurs for b=0, 4, thus m=2.5, 4.75 invalid, only when b=0, m=2.5 invalid; b=0: m=2.5 not integer, b=4: m= (250 + 100)/100= 3.5 invalid; corrected counts show only b=0, m=2, b=4, m=3 fit. But since only integer m, feasible are those with integer division.

Final answer: b=0, m=2; b=4, m=3. The question is about b as a ℕ, with the set of values, so answer is b=4.
