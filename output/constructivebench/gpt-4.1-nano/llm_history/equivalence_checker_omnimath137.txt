  |(a * (R : ℝ)^2 + b * (R : ℝ) + c) / (d * (R : ℝ)^2 + e * (R : ℝ) + f) - 2^(1/3 : ℝ)| < |(R : ℝ) - 2^(1/3 : ℝ)| := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: (0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2)
Proposed Answer: (0, 1, 0, 1, -1, 0)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for integer coefficients (a,b,c,d,e,f) such that the given rational function approximates 2^(1/3) better than R itself does.

2. The ground truth answer (0,2,2,1,0,2) gives the function (2R + 2)/(R² + 2). At R=2^(1/3), this evaluates to (2*2^(1/3)+2)/(2^(2/3)+2) ≈ 1.2599 + 2)/(1.5874 + 2) ≈ 3.2599/3.5874 ≈ 0.9087, which is not close to 2^(1/3)≈1.2599.

3. The proposed answer (0,1,0,1,-1,0) gives the function R/(R - 1). This function has a pole at R=1 and doesn't approximate 2^(1/3) well either.

4. Neither answer seems to satisfy the condition that the approximation error is less than |R - 2^(1/3)| for all R ≥ 0.
