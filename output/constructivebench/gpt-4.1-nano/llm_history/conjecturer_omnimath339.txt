The sum involves floors of n/2 for n in [1, L], which equates to summing roughly half of the integers, leading to a quadratic pattern. To get a perfect square, the sum resembles a perfect square for even L. An explicit form is L*(L+1)/4, which is a perfect square when L is divisible by 2, giving (L/2)*(L+1) as a perfect square when L/2 equals itself squared. Simplify to the form L(L+1)/4 for L divisible by 2.
