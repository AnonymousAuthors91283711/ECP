The problem involves the divisors of \(K = 20^{T} \times 23^{T}\), where \(T=21\). Since \(20 = 2^{2} \times 5\), the divisors are formed from \(2^{a}\times 5^{b}\times 23^{c}\) with \(a, b, c \le T\). The greatest prime divisor of \(K\) is the larger of the primes \(23\) since \(23 > 5, 2\). 

The only maximum prime divisor of \(K\) is therefore \(23\). 

Final answer: 

<<<23>>>
