  IsLeast {x : ℝ | x = a/(b^3+4) + b/(c^3+4) + c/(d^3+4) + d/(a^3+4)} omnimath477_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the symmetry and positivity constraints, the minimum value likely occurs when all variables are equal: a = b = c = d = 1. Substituting yields each term as \( 1 / (1 + 4) = 1/5 \), sum to \( 4/5 \). The minimal sum due to positivity and symmetry is thus \(\frac{4}{5}\).
