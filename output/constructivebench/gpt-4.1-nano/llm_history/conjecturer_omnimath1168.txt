  f ⟨2002, by simp⟩ = omnimath1168_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The recursive pattern suggests the sequence simplifies to a linear function with fractional adjustments: from initial 2, adding n+3 and halving the prior term. Pattern analysis indicates a continued fraction related to the sequence n + 3 + 1/2 * (n+2 + ...). Experimenting with initial values shows it converges to a form close to (n+2) to an asymptotic line. Based on pattern and calculations, the closed-form likely resembles an affine function with fractional coefficients including 1/2. Given the recursive definition, the candidate answer simplifies consistently to (n + 3), adjusted by initial conditions.  

Final answer: <<< (2002 + 3) >>>
