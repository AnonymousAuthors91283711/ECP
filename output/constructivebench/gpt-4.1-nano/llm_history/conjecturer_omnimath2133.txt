The sum involves terms with indices and powers of 4, suggesting a pattern related to summing products of list elements and powers of 4. The non-zero entries in the first list are at positions 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, indicating the sum effectively combines these terms with powers of 4. Recognizing the pattern, the total sum simplifies to a polynomial expression in 4, with coefficients matching the list elements: 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1. Summing these with powers of 4 yields 4^6 + 2*4^5 + 4^4 + 2*4^3 + 4^2 + 2*4 + 1. The resulting closed form is \( 4^{6} + 2 \times 4^{5} + 4^{4} + 2 \times 4^{3} + 4^{2} + 2 \times 4 + 1 \). Simplify to:

<<<4^6 + 2*4^5 + 4^4 + 2*4^3 + 4^2 + 2*4 + 1>>>
