The sum represents the number of divisors minus 1, restricted by conditions. Since perfect p implies p = sum of its divisors (excluding p), and for these numbers, f is zero when p mod 10 = 4 or p is perfect, the sum count reduces to count of such non-perfect, ending-with-4 numbers. The pattern suggests the answer is proportional to the number of such integers ending with 4 below 2000, which is 200, times 9 (number of tens), leading to 1800. However, given the structure, the answer focuses on numbers 1 to 1998 with specific digit properties, ultimately yielding 180. 

Thus, the simplified closed-form answer matches the enumeration's pattern, giving:

<<<(199 * 9)>>>
