Because f0^2 = 0.04 and f5^2 = 0.01, their nonnegative roots are 0.2 & 0.1; choosing maximizing correlations suggests f0=0.2 and f5=0.1 for maximum p. The sum constraint and nonnegativity imply minimal redistribution among remaining variables, which do not increase this maximum. The result p = 2(f0*f5 + sum of cross terms) with maximum occurs at these roots and zero elsewhere.

The errors stem from using "Because" as if it were a keyword or command in Lean, which it is not; it is just a conjunction in natural language. We should replace it with a proper Lean expression, typically an (=) statement or a definitional abbreviation. Also, the expression is a natural language explanation, but in Lean, we want a formal expression, likely a constant definition of type ℝ that reflects the maximum value of p given the constraints. From the reasoning, the optimal values for f0 and f5 are the positive roots of the squares, i.e., 0.2 and 0.1, and the maximum of p is obtained by substituting these into the expression: p = 2*(f0*f5 + sum of cross terms), with maximum cross terms being zero when remaining variables are minimized or zero.

Based on the pattern and the reasoning, the formal closed-form answer should be:

- Fix the syntax errors by removing "Because" and constructing a proper definition.
- The maximum p is 0.24, which is 2 * (0.2 * 0.1 + 0 + 0), considering the cross terms are minimized or zero.

Thus, the answer in Lean should be:

<<<0.24>>>

This aligns with the pattern of enumerated solutions and the reasoning about assigning the extremal values to f0 and f5.
