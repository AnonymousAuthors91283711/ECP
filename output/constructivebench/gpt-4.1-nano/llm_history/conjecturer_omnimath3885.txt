The pattern suggests the functions should satisfy a quadratic relation leading to linear or affine forms, considering the form of the functional equation involving powers \( a^2 + b^2 \). Based on the enumeration and the functional structure, the set of solutions likely includes functions of the form \( f(n) = c n \) where \( c \in \mathbb{Z} \). Thus, the closed-form answer can be expressed as all functions \( f : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \) with \( f(n) = c \cdot n \) for some integer \( c \).

The current proposed answer is an explanation rather than a formal Lean expression, which causes the syntax errors. To define the set of solutions formally, we should express that \( f \) belongs to the set of functions from \(\mathbb{Z}\) to \(\mathbb{Z}\) such that \( f(n) = c \cdot n \) for some \( c \in \mathbb{Z} \). This can be written as a sigma type or as a set comprehension, for example:

```lean
{f | ∃ c : ℤ, ∀ n : ℤ, f n = c * n}
```

This correctly captures the set of all linear functions \( f(n) = c n \). 

The corrected final answer wraps this in the delimiters `<<< >>>` as per instructions:

<<<{f : ℤ → ℤ | ∃ c : ℤ, ∀ n : ℤ, f n = c * n}>>

This form should compile successfully in Lean, representing the solution set as all functions scalar multiples of the identity function.
