theorem omnimath1663 :
  ∃ (p q : ℚ[X]), degree p ≤ 2 ∧ degree q ≤ 2 ∧
  (∀ n ∈ ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5} : Finset ℕ), eval (n : ℚ) p / eval (n : ℚ) q = (n : ℚ)^3) ∧
  eval 0 p / eval 0 q = omnimath1663_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Based on the pattern of the given constraints and the enumerated answers, the answer likely simplifies to a rational number matching the intended ratio at zero, i.e., \(0\). The division condition suggests that \(p\) is proportional to \(x^3\) and \(q\) to a quadratic, but these cancel at zero, leaving the ratio as a constant. The simplest rational that fits the pattern across the specified points, considering typical polynomial interpolations, is \(0\). Therefore, the most plausible closed-form answer is:

<<<0>>>
