It appears the sum involves powers of 2 with alternating signs based on the number of 1's in the binary representation. Recognizing pattern similar to geometric series with binary digit restrictions, the sum simplifies to a finite geometric series. The sum, after algebraic simplification, equals (1/255). Multiplying by 2^n and automating signs yields the closed form: ((-1)/255). 

<<<(-1) / 255>>>
