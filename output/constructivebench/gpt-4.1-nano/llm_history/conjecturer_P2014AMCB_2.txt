The problem asks for the greatest \( n \) such that there exists a \( k \leq n \) with \( k + (n - k) \times \frac{2}{3} \leq 30 \). To maximize \( n \), pick the \( k \) that satisfies the inequality with equality:

\[
k + (n - k) \times \frac{2}{3} = 30
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
k + \frac{2}{3} n - \frac{2}{3} k = 30 \Rightarrow \left(1 - \frac{2}{3}\right) k + \frac{2}{3} n = 30
\]

\[
\frac{1}{3} k + \frac{2}{3} n = 30 \Rightarrow k + 2 n = 90
\]

Given \( k \leq n \), maximum \( n \) occurs at \( k = n \):

\[
n + 2 n = 90 \Rightarrow 3 n = 90 \Rightarrow n = 30
\]

Check at \( k = n = 30 \):

\[
k + (n - k) \times \frac{2}{3} = 30 + 0 = 30 \leq 30
\]

which satisfies the condition. For \( n = 31 \), the equality would be:

\[
k + 2 n = 90 \Rightarrow k = 90 - 2 n \Rightarrow k = 90 - 62 = 28
\]

which again satisfies \( k \leq n=31 \) and the original inequality:

\[
28 + (31 - 28) \times \frac{2}{3} = 28 + 3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 28 + 2= 30
\]

but for \( n=32 \), the maximum \( k \) becomes:

\[
k = 90 - 2 \times 32= 90 - 64= 26
\]

which is less than 32, so inequality holds:

\[
26 + (32-26) \times \frac{2}{3} = 26 + 6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 26 + 4=30
\]

and at \( n=33 \):

\[
k= 90 - 66 = 24 \leq 33
\]

and inequality holds exactly (as the previous pattern). The maximum \( n \) is \( 45 \) when \( k = 0 \):

\[
0 + (n - 0) \times \frac{2}{3} \leq 30 \Rightarrow \frac{2}{3} n \leq 30 \Rightarrow n \leq 45
\]

= equality at \( n=45 \).  

**Final answer:**

<<<45>>>
