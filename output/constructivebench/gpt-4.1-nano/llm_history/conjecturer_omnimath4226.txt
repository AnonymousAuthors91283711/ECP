theorem omnimath4226 (x y z w : ℝ) 
  (h1 : x + y + z + w = 0) 
  (h2 : x^7 + y^7 + z^7 + w^7 = 0) : 
  w * (w + x) * (w + y) * (w + z) = omnimath4226_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on symmetry and the given conditions, the expression simplifies to zero, independent of x, y, z. This is typical in symmetric sums involving roots of symmetric equations when certain sums vanish.
