Based on the geometric relations and the rule of proportions, the answer should be the ratio involving known sides of a right triangle with similar constraints. Noticing the pattern from the enumerated answers, the ratio appears to be a known hypotenuse-to-leg ratio, which reduces to √2.

The error occurs because the Lean standard library refers to the square root function as `Real.sizeof.sqrt` or more commonly `Real.sqrt`, but in newer versions, the correct function is `Real.sqrt`. However, it appears that in the current context, the identifier `real.sqrt` is unrecognized, indicating either it wasn't imported properly or the module uses a different naming.

Given the problem's geometric constraints:

- \( a, b, c > 0 \),
- \( a c = b^2 \),
- \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \),

and knowing the pattern from the enumerated answers, which ends up with a simple constant answer, it's natural to suspect the value of \(\frac{c}{a}\) reduces to \(\sqrt{2}\), considering the classic right triangle with ratios involving \(\sqrt{2}\).

The key is to correctly write the square root function. In `Mathlib`, the square root function for reals is `Real.sqrt`.

**Fix:**

Use `Real.sqrt` with a capital `R` and the module `Mathlib.Mathlib`, assuming it's properly imported. If not, prefix with `Real.sqrt`.

**Conjectured answer:**

Given the geometric identities, the ratio \(\frac{c}{a}\) simplifies to \(\sqrt{2}\). Therefore, the answer:

```lean
fun _ => Real.sqrt 2
```

Alternatively, if `Real.sqrt` is not directly available, perhaps via `Real.sqrt`. 

**Final fixed answer:**

<<<fun _ => Real.sqrt 2>>>

**Explanation:**

The main fix is replacing `real.sqrt` with `Real.sqrt`, which is the correct identifier in the `Mathlib` import for the square root function on real numbers. The answer is a constant \(\sqrt{2}\), matching the pattern derived from the constraints, i.e., the ratio \(c/a\) in a right triangle with the given relations simplifies to \(\sqrt{2}\).[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The current proposed answer `fun _ => Real.sqrt 2` is a function, but the abbreviation `omnimath1809_answer` should be a value of type ℝ, not a function. The error indicates a mismatch between the expected type ℝ and the provided function type.

From the problem, the key equations are:
- \(a c = b^2\),
- \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\),
- with \(a, b, c > 0\).

These are the classic relations characteristic of a scaled Pythagorean triple with certain ratios. Dividing the key equation \(a c = b^2\) by \(a^2\), we get:
\[
\frac{c}{a} = \frac{b^2}{a^2} = \left( \frac{b}{a} \right)^2.
\]

From the right triangle condition \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\), dividing through by \(a^2\):
\[
1 + \left(\frac{b}{a}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{c}{a}\right)^2.
\]
But since \(\frac{c}{a} = \left(\frac{b}{a}\right)^2\), substitute:
\[
1 + \left(\frac{b}{a}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{b}{a}\right)^4.
\]
Let \(x = \frac{b}{a}\). Then:
\[
1 + x^2 = x^4,
\]
which can be rewritten as:
\[
x^4 - x^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Let \(y = x^2\), then:
\[
y^2 - y - 1 = 0,
\]
solving quadratic:
\[
y = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]
Since \(a, b, c > 0\), \(x = \frac{b}{a} > 0\), so \(y > 0\). Choosing the positive root:
\[
y = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Recall that \(\frac{c}{a} = x^2 = y\), so:
\[
\frac{c}{a} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Now, from the first relation \(a c = b^2\), rewrite as:
\[
c = \frac{b^2}{a},
\]
and
\[
\frac{c}{a} = \frac{b^2}{a^2} = x^2 = y.
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(a\):
\[
c = y a,
\]
and from the relation \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\), divide both sides by \(a^2\):
\[
1 + x^2 = (c/a)^2 = y^2,
\]
which is consistent with earlier derivation.

Now, the key ratio of \(c/a\) is \(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\), which is exactly the golden ratio \(\phi\). Since the answer asked to express \(c/a\), and the derivation indicates that this ratio is \(\phi = (\sqrt{5} + 1)/2\).

Hence, the answer value is:
\[
c / a = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}.
\]

**Final Lean expression:**

```lean
<<<(Real.sqrt 5 + 1) / 2>>>
```

This expression is an exact closed-form value for the ratio \(c/a\) under the given conditions, fully consistent with the algebraic derivation.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error in your Lean code arises because the syntax `<<<` and `>>>` are not valid in Lean syntax—they are often used for delimiters in external communication or documentation, but Lean does not recognize them as code delimiters. To fix this, the final answer should be written as a normal Lean expression directly, without these delimiters. 

From the problem's geometric context, the given conditions (a right triangle with sides in geometric progression) suggest that `c/a` is a constant ratio related to the classic Pythagorean triple involving √5, notably the golden ratio (φ = (1 + √5)/2). This fits the enumerated answer `(√5 + 1)/2`, which often appears in such geometric contexts.

Thus, the correct way to write the answer in Lean is just to define `omnimath1809_answer` as a real number without the `<<<` delimiters.

**My conjectured final answer:**

```lean
noncomputable abbrev omnimath1809_answer : ℝ := (Real.sqrt 5 + 1) / 2
```

**Explanation:**  
This expression correctly defines the ratio `c/a` consistent with a well-known, algebraically significant ratio (the golden ratio), which fits the Pythagorean and geometric constraints given. Removing the invalid delimiters should fix the compilation error, and using this closed form aligns with the enumerated answer pattern.
