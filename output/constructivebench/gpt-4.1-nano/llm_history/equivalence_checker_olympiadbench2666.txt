Ground Truth Answer: 5762
Proposed Answer: 1000 + 145
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the largest 4-digit number (1000-9999) where:
   - The number equals the sum of factorials of its 2nd, 3rd and 4th digits
   - The first digit must be >0 (which is already implied by being 4-digit)

2. Ground truth answer is 5762:
   - Digits: 5,7,6,2
   - Check: 5! + 7! + 6! + 2! = 120 + 5040 + 720 + 2 = 5882 ≠ 5762
   - Wait, this seems incorrect. Maybe the problem is only using B,C,D (2nd,3rd,4th digits)?
   - For 5762: 7! + 6! + 2! = 5040 + 720 + 2 = 5762 (matches)

3. Proposed answer is 1000 + 145 = 1145:
   - Digits: 1,1,4,5
   - Check: 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145
   - But 1145 ≠ 145, so this doesn't satisfy the condition

The ground truth answer correctly satisfies the condition when considering only the last three digits' factorials summing to the number, while the proposed answer does not satisfy the condition at all.
