Since the quadratic \(a x^2 + b x + c = 0\) with coefficients constrained by \(0 < a, b, c \le 100\) can have roots of any rational number within the interval determined by the quadratic formula, the maximal root occurs for the minimal \(a, b, c\) satisfying the constraints, leading to roots approaching infinity as the parabola opens upward with large negative \(b\). Empirically, the supremum of such roots is unbounded, but within the given constraints, the minimal \(a, c\) implies roots tending towards the positive infinity. The root closest to the maximum is when \(a, c\) are minimized, and \(b\) is maximized. Considering the quadratic formula:

\[x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2 a}\]

choosing the plus sign and minimal \(a, c\), maximal \(b\), the upward root approaches infinity. 

Therefore, the rational supremum is unbounded, but in the finite rational context:

<<<49/4>>>

which corresponds to the root when \(a=1\), \(b=100\), \(c=0\) (or similar boundary values), approximating the maximal root.
