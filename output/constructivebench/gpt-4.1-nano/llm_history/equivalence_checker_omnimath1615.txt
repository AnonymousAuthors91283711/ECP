noncomputable abbrev omnimath1615_answer : ℂ → ℂ := sorry
theorem omnimath1615 (z : ℂ) (hz : z^23 = 1) (hz_nonreal : z.im ≠ 0) :
    (∑ k ∈ Finset.range 23, 1 / (1 + z^k + z^(2*k))) = omnimath1615_answer z := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun z => if z^23 = 1 ∧ z.im ≠ 0 then 46 / 3 else 0
Proposed Answer: fun z : ℂ => (4 * z) / (z^2 + z + 1)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
- We're dealing with complex numbers z that are 23rd roots of unity (z²³ = 1) and non-real (z.im ≠ 0)
- We need to evaluate a sum of fractions involving powers of z
- The sum has 23 terms (k from 0 to 22)

Ground Truth Answer:
- For z satisfying the conditions (z²³=1 and z.im≠0), returns 46/3
- Otherwise returns 0

Proposed Answer:
- Gives a function (4*z)/(z² + z + 1) for any z

Comparison:
1. The ground truth is piecewise defined, while the proposed answer is a single expression
2. For z satisfying the conditions, the proposed answer doesn't simplify to 46/3
3. The proposed answer doesn't handle the case when conditions aren't met
4. The form (4*z)/(z² + z + 1) doesn't match the constant 46/3 that should be returned for valid z

Conclusion: The answers are not equivalent.
