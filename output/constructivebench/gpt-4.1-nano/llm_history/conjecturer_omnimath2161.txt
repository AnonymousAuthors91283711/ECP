The pattern suggests p is a prime related to squares and digit concatenations involving two primes q and r, with p^2 = 3 + concatenation of q and r's digits. Given the pattern, the set probably consists of primes p such that p^2 + 3 equals a number formed by concatenating two primes q and r. The most straightforward candidate for such p, considering common digit concatenation patterns, is p = 2, since for p=2, p^2=4, and 4+3=7, which is prime, but digit concatenation for q and r should produce 4, which is a single digit, thus possibly not fitting.

However, considering larger primes and the pattern, p=7 is often involved in such digit concatenation problems. For p=7, p^2=49, and 49+3=52 is not prime, so likely not.

Alternatively, the set includes primes whose square plus 3 equals the number formed by concatenating two smaller primes q and r. The simplest consistent case is p=2, q=2, r=2, with digits '2' and '2', concatenation gives '22'. But 22 is not prime, so perhaps the primes q and r are arbitrary primes with digit concatenation forming a larger number matching p^2 - 3.

Given the pattern and typical solutions, I've observed that p=7 could be a response: 7^2=49, 49+3=52, which is not prime, so discard. Next candidate p=3: 9+3=12, not prime.

Alternatively, for p=13: 13^2=169, 169+3=172, which doesn't match the concatenation.

At this point, based on pattern, the most general candidate consistent with the extent of enumeration is p=2, with the concatenation of '2' and '2' forming '22', which is not prime, so not suitable; p=3? Let's check 3^2=9, 9+3=12, not prime. p=5: 25+3=28, no. p=17: 289+3=292, no. 

Billions of prime concatenations are possible, but since we're asked only for the set, the minimal consistent prime seems p=2. So, perhaps the only such p satisfying the condition is p=2.

Thus, the set is likely {2}.

Hence, the final answer is:

<<<{2}>>>
