The pattern of sum relations suggests solutions relate to prime p dividing certain sums, and n is tied to p via a multiple. The sum of squares from 1 to p equals p(p + 1)(2p + 1)/6. For the sums to be proportional with factor 3, n should be a multiple of p that makes the sums align properly. 

Hence, the set includes pairs where n is a multiple of p, with p prime, and both > 0. The minimal such n is p, the sum of 1..p, so when n ≥ p, the sums match.

The main error arises from incorrect syntax for declaring set comprehensions in Lean. The syntax {(n, p) | condition} is not directly valid; instead, we should use set builder notation or construct the set via `Finset` or `Set`. Also, the error about numeral `0` suggests that `zero` should be used explicitly. 

Based on the pattern of the answer and typical structures in such problems, the intended set likely includes pairs `(n, p)` where `p` is a positive prime, and `n` is at least as large as `p` (so that the sum over `1..n` is comparable to the sum over `1..p`). The condition `p > 0 ∧ Nat.Prime p ∧ n ≥ p` makes sense. 

The correct way to define such a set with comprehension in Lean is:
```lean
{ np : ℕ × ℕ | 0 < np.2 ∧ Nat.Prime np.2 ∧ np.1 ≥ np.2 }
```
Here, `np` is a pair `(n, p)`. `np.2` refers to `p`, and `np.1` to `n`, which matches the pattern and enforces `p > 0` as `0 < p`. 

Final fixed answer enclosed in `<<< >>>`:

<<<{ np : ℕ × ℕ | 0 < np.2 ∧ Nat.Prime np.2 ∧ np.1 ≥ np.2 }>>>
