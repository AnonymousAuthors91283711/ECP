The roots are solutions to the polynomial, including 2, 4, and 6. The polynomial can be factored or expanded to identify roots explicitly, implying a final answer involving these roots' sum or a relation. Based on typical root-sum properties, the constant term or product links to root sums. The roots are 2, 4, 6, and 2, with multiplicities considered; their sum is 2 + 2 + 4 + 6 = 14. The product of roots is (2)(2)(4)(6)= 96, but since the expression appears symmetric with roots, the key value (sum of roots) is 14, matching the pattern observed in the enumerated answers.
