The expression involves the set of integer pairs with bounds, where the quadratic form equals a prime power. Given the form and prime powers, the most likely constant value is the count of such pairs, simplifying conditions to fixed solutions for x and y, independent of p and k. As the max bounds are 2020, and the quadratic form yields minimal solutions when x and y are small, the total solutions count is small and fixed.
