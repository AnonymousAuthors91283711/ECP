Ground Truth Answer: { (m, n) : ℤ × ℤ | m ≠ 0 ∧ n ≠ 0 ∧ Int.gcd m n = 1 }
Proposed Answer: {(m, n) | m^2 - m * n + n^2 ≤ 1}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding pairs (m,n) where a certain condition about sets containing m and n holds. The condition implies that m and n generate all integers through a specific quadratic operation.

2. The ground truth answer states that m and n must be non-zero, and their greatest common divisor must be 1. This makes sense because:
   - Non-zero condition ensures meaningful operations
   - GCD=1 ensures they can generate all integers through linear combinations

3. The proposed answer suggests a quadratic condition m² - m*n + n² ≤ 1. Let's test this:
   - For (1,0): satisfies proposed (1 ≤ 1) but fails ground truth (n=0)
   - For (1,1): satisfies proposed (1 ≤ 1) but fails ground truth (gcd=1)
   - For (2,1): fails proposed (3 ≤ 1) but satisfies ground truth

The proposed answer incorrectly includes some pairs that shouldn't be included (like (1,0)) and excludes valid pairs (like (2,1)). The conditions are fundamentally different.
