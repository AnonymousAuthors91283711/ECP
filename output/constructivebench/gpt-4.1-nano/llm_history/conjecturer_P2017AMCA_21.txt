theorem P2017AMCA_21 : Nat.card S_closure = P2017AMCA_21_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sequence involves iterated roots of polynomials with coefficients in {0, 10} and 0, 10, suggesting the set eventually reaches all integers between 0 and 20 by recursive addition and subtraction.  
Final answer: <<<20>>>
