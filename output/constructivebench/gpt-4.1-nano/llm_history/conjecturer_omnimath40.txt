The sums involve four fixed indices with given spacing, a periodic and bounded difference function, and zero total sum. Given the oscillation constraints and symmetry, the maximum sums occur when a_i's are as large as possible in magnitude while satisfying the sum zero and bounded differences. The extremal configuration suggests sinusoidal or alternating patterns with amplitude at most 0.5.

Therefore, the maximum of the sum of four points \(a i_j\) occurs when two of them are 0.5 and two are -0.5 (alternating), summing to 0, giving total sum 0. 

For the product sum, placing \(a i_j = ±0.5\), the maximum occurs with two +0.5 and two -0.5, producing \( (0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2 = 0.5 \).

Thus, the final maximum sums are \( 0 \) and \( 0.5 \), respectively.
