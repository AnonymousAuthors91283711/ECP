Given the constraints, the number must be four digits with A > 0, and n = B! + C! + D!. Since A is the thousand's digit, and n = factorial B + factorial C + factorial D, the only practical choice for B, C, D is from 0 to 9. The sum of factorials is at most 3 * 9! = 3 * 362880 = 1088640, but since n is at most 9999, factorial sum must fit four digits, and B, C, D must be small enough so that n equals that sum. Recognizing that for B, C, D, the sum factorial produces a four-digit number with A as the first digit, the only consistent choice is when B, C, D are 4, 5, 6, as their factorial sum matches a four-digit number with leading digit 1.

The only possible combination with factorial sum ≤ 9999 and matching n is with B=4, C=5, D=6:

factorial 4 + factorial 5 + factorial 6 = 24 + 120 + 720 = 864, leading to n = 864, which is less than 1000, invalid.

Similarly, test B=5, C=5, D=5: sum is 120 + 120 + 120 = 360, still less than 1000, invalid.

Now, testing for B=5, C=6, D=6: sum is 120 + 720 + 720 = 1560.

Now n=1560, and A=1 (since 1000 ≤ n ≤ 9999), leads with '1', matching the pattern. So, n=1560, with digits: A=1, B=5, C=6, D=0.

Check sum of factorials:

factorial 5 + factorial 6 + factorial 0 = 120 + 720 + 1= 841, which is less than 1560. Not matching.

Given the pattern, only when B=1, C=4, D=5:

sum: 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120= 145

n=145, which is three digits, buttocks B≥1, so no; need four-digit n, so A=1; then, n= 1000 + x, with n= factorial B + factorial C + factorial D. So, the only feasible is n= 145, but invalid due to length.

Given the pattern, the only number satisfying the sum of factorials matching the number itself, with constraints is 145, which is classic. It has A=0, but requirement is A>0, so invalid.

Alternatively, with the pattern of known "factorions" being 1, 2, and 145, only 145 has the sum of factorials equal to itself, but with less than four digits.

In conclusion, the only number fitting the requirements is **145**, with A=1, B=4, C=5, D=0, and sum: 1! + 4! + 5! = 145, matching number.

Therefore, final expression is:

<<<1000 + 145>>>

But the number 145 is less than 1000, invalid for A>0.

Given the constraints, the only consistent answer matching the properties is n= **145**, which satisfies the factorial sum condition but not with four digits.

However, the problem constraints specify n with 1000 ≤ n ≤ 9999, so no such number exists matching these conditions.

Thus, the answer is 0, indicating no such number.
