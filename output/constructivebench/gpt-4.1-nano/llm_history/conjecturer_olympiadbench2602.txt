Based on the recursive definition, initial conditions, and the palindrome property, the pattern suggests that a(n) forms a sequence where each term's sequence length doubles and remains palindromic. For n=1, length=1; for n=2, length=1; for n=3, length=2; sequences grow roughly as 2^{n-2} for n ≥ 3, maintaining palindromes. 

Therefore, the number of palindromic a(n) values for n in [1,1000] can be expressed as the count of n such that the sequence length is at most 1000, simplifying roughly as 2^{n-2} ≤ 1000, with n ≥ 3. 

The largest n satisfying 2^{n-2} ≤ 1000 is n - 2 ≤ log₂ 1000 ≈ 9.96, so n ≤ 11.

Counting 1 and 2 as initial palindromic cases and from 3 to 11: total 11.

Thus, the answer is 11.

\(\boxed{11}\)

or in Lean expression:

<<<11>>>
