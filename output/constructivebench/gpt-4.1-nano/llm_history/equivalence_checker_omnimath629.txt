abbrev omnimath629_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath629 (n : ℕ) :
  let Sn := Icc 1 n
  let T := { (A, B, C) : Set Sn × Set Sn × Set Sn | A ⊆ B ∧ (Sn \ A) ⊆ C }
  Nat.card T = omnimath629_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 2^(2 * n)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 2^(2 * n)
<<<True>>>
