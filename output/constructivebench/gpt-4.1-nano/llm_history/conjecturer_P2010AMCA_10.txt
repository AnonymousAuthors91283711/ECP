(hq : q = 9)
(hseq : (3*p - q) - p = (3*p + q) - (3*p - q))

The given conditions imply symmetry around q=9 and simplification of expressions involving p. The pattern indicates that the final answer is a constant, independent of p, and relates to the constant q=9. Given the symmetry, the expression simplifies to a constant value involving q, which is 9.

Thus, the final answer should be the value of the entire expression evaluated at q=9, which simplifies to 2010 * (2 * q) = 2010 * 18.

Answer: <<<2010 * 18>>>
