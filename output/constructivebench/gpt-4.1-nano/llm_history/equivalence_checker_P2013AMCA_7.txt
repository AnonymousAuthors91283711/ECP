Ground Truth Answer: 10
Proposed Answer: 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a recursive sequence S where for n ≥ 3, S(n) = S(n-1) + S(n-2). This is similar to the Fibonacci sequence.

2. We're given:
   - S(9) = 110
   - S(7) = 42
   - We need to find S(4)

3. The ground truth answer is 10, while the proposed answer is 7.

4. Let's work backwards from the given values:
   - S(9) = S(8) + S(7) ⇒ 110 = S(8) + 42 ⇒ S(8) = 68
   - S(8) = S(7) + S(6) ⇒ 68 = 42 + S(6) ⇒ S(6) = 26
   - S(7) = S(6) + S(5) ⇒ 42 = 26 + S(5) ⇒ S(5) = 16
   - S(6) = S(5) + S(4) ⇒ 26 = 16 + S(4) ⇒ S(4) = 10

The calculations clearly show that S(4) must be 10, not 7. The proposed answer is incorrect.
