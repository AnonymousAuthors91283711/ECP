Ground Truth Answer: 6 * 5 * 4 * (6 * 5 * 4 / 6)
Proposed Answer: 120
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
We need to count the number of 3-element subsets of Fin 6 × Fin 6 where:
1. All elements have distinct first coordinates
2. All elements have distinct second coordinates

This is equivalent to counting the number of ways to place 3 non-attacking rooks on a 6×6 chessboard.

Ground Truth Answer Analysis:
6 * 5 * 4 * (6 * 5 * 4 / 6) breaks down as:
- First part (6*5*4): Ways to choose distinct rows for 3 rooks
- Second part (6*5*4/6): 
  - 6*5*4: Ways to choose distinct columns
  - Divided by 6: Accounts for permutation symmetry (order doesn't matter)

Simplified: 6*5*4 * (6*5*4)/6 = 120 * 20 = 2400

Proposed Answer Analysis:
120 is much smaller than 2400. It seems to only account for one part of the counting (either rows or columns) without considering the full combination.

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect as it's missing the complete counting required by the problem.
