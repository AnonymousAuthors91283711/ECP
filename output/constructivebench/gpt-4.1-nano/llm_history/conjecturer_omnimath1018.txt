The problem asks for the set of all positive integers \(n\) such that there does not exist a \(k\) with all numbers between \(k+1\) and \(k+n\) composite, and \(k+n < n!\). 

This condition essentially states \(n\) for which no block of size \(n\) is fully composite before \(n!\). Known results about primes and factorials suggest the set of \(n\) for which prime-rich intervals exist are all \(n\) (since factorial grows rapidly) but certain specific \(n\)fail this condition. A minimal set includes all \(n \ge 2\), and particularly those \(n\) with a prime or properties avoiding full composite blocks.

Based on enumerations and typical prime distribution, the set of \(n\) satisfying this is \(\{1, 2\}\).

Answer:

<<<{1, 2}>>>
