Ground Truth Answer: 1980
Proposed Answer:  2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a system of equations involving three distinct primes p, q, r and a variable A we need to find.
2. The equations are:
   - 2pqr + 50pq = 7pqr + 55pr
   - 7pqr + 55pr = 8pqr + 12qr
3. Simplifying the first equation: 50pq - 55pr = 5pqr → 10q - 11r = qr
4. Simplifying the second equation: 55pr - 12qr = pqr → 55p - 12q = pq
5. Solving these equations leads to p=5, q=11, r=2 (the only combination of distinct primes satisfying both equations)
6. The problem asks for A, but doesn't specify its relation to p,q,r. However, the ground truth answer 1980 equals 2*2*3*3*5*11, which is 2²*3²*5*11 - but this doesn't directly relate to our found primes.

The proposed answer is 2, which is just one of the primes we found (r=2), but doesn't match the ground truth answer of 1980. There's no clear connection between the two answers.
