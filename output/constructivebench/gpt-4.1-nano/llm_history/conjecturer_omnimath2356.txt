theorem omnimath2356 :
  let rec a : ℕ → ℕ
    | 0 => 0      | 1 => 1
    | n + 1 => (a n + (n + 1)) % 2012
  a 2012 = omnimath2356_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests that a(0)=0, a(1)=1, and for n ≥ 2, a(n+1) involves modular addition. The sequence likely represents cumulative sums modulo 2012, leading to a conclusion that a(2012) equals the sum of integers from 1 to 2012 modulo 2012, which simplifies to 2012 (due to the sum being divisible by 2012 at some point) or zero. Testing the sum: sum_{i=1}^{2012} i ≡ 0 mod 2012. Therefore, the closed-form answer is 0.
