theorem omnimath158 :

Ground Truth Answer: {(7, 11), (11, 7)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 14), (14, 1), (2, 7), (7, 2)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all pairs of positive integers (x,y) that satisfy the equation:
   9*(x² + y² + 1) + 2*(3xy + 2) = 2005

2. Let's test the ground truth answer:
   For (7,11):
   9*(49 + 121 + 1) + 2*(231 + 2) = 9*171 + 2*233 = 1539 + 466 = 2005 ✓
   For (11,7) same result by symmetry ✓

3. Test the proposed answer:
   For (1,14):
   9*(1 + 196 + 1) + 2*(42 + 2) = 9*198 + 2*44 = 1782 + 88 = 1870 ≠ 2005 ✗
   For (14,1) same result ✗
   For (2,7):
   9*(4 + 49 + 1) + 2*(42 + 2) = 9*54 + 2*44 = 486 + 88 = 574 ≠ 2005 ✗
   For (7,2) same result ✗

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the equation at all, while the ground truth answer does.

<<<False>>>
