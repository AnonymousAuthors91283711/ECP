Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: (8 * 2 + 2) - 8
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer carefully.

The problem involves calculating the difference in payments between Dave and Doug for sharing a pizza with plain and anchovy slices. The ground truth answer is 4, which comes from carefully calculating each person's share and their payments.

The proposed answer is (8*2 + 2) - 8 = (16 + 2) - 8 = 10, which doesn't match the ground truth answer of 4. The proposed answer seems to be making incorrect assumptions about the calculations:
1. It incorrectly multiplies 8*2 (possibly misunderstanding the plain cost)
2. It adds 2 (anchovy cost) without proper context
3. It subtracts 8 without proper justification

The correct calculation should be:
- Dave's payment: (1*8/8) + (4*(8+2)/4) = 1 + 10 = 11
- Doug's payment: 3*8/8 = 3
- Difference: 11 - 3 = 8

Wait, this contradicts both answers. Actually, looking back at the problem statement, the correct calculation should be:
- Dave's payment: (1*8)/8 + (4*(8+2))/4 = 1 + 10 = 11
- Doug's payment: (3*8)/8 = 3
- Difference: 11 - 3 = 8

But the ground truth says 4, which suggests there might be a different interpretation. The proposed answer of 10 is clearly incorrect regardless.
