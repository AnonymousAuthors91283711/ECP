: {k ∈ Set.Icc 1 17 | (5 * Real.sin (10 * k * (π / 180)) - 2) / (Real.sin (10 * k * (π / 180)) ^ 2) ≥ 2}.ncard = olympiadbench2580_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Let's analyze the inequality:  
(5 * sin(10k°) - 2) / (sin(10k°)^2) ≥ 2.

By testing key points and patterns from the enumeration, solutions occur when sin(10k°) = 0.4, since substituting this into the expression yields equality.  

Thus, k corresponding to sin(10k°) = 0.4 gives the solutions, and k in {1,..,17} where 10k° aligns with arcsin(0.4). The solutions are at k=4, 8, 12, 16.  

Number of solutions: 4.  

The answer is the size of this set, which is 4.  

Answer: <<<4>>>
