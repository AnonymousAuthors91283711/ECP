The pattern suggests the maximal difference between two three-digit numbers with the specified digit conditions occurs when digits are most dispersed, i.e., with a, b, c distinct and their squares/differences maximized. The largest such difference, given constraints, is when a and c are at opposite extremes (e.g., a=9, c=1) and b anywhere satisfying the conditions, yielding the maximum difference of 88.
