The sum of the double summation over s(i) = ±1 simplifies to zero, since positive and negative contributions cancel out. The sum of all pairwise products for vectors of ±1 entries is minimum 0. So, the least value of the sum is 0.

The core idea is that the sum over pairs i,j of s(i)*s(j), where each s(i) = ±1, simplifies to (∑ s(i))^2. This is because:
∑_{i,j} s(i)*s(j) = (∑_{i} s(i))^2.
Given s(i) ∈ {−1, 1} for all i, the sum (∑ s(i)) can take any integer value between -n and n, where n = 95 in this case. The minimum of (∑ s(i))^2 is achieved when ∑ s(i) = 0, which is possible when there are an equal number of 1s and −1s, i.e., when n is even; if n is odd, the sum can't be exactly zero, but can be ±1, leading to the minimal value being 1. Since n=95 (odd), the minimal sum of squares is 1, corresponding to a configuration with 47 entries of 1 and 48 entries of -1 (or vice versa), making the total sum (∑ s(i)) = ±1, and the corresponding sum of pairwise products being 1. 

Therefore, the minimum of ∑_{i,j} s(i) * s(j) for s(i) = ±1 is 1.

Final answer in Lean is: 

<<<(∑_{i=1}^{95} s(i))^2, where the minimal value is 1.>>

However, to present a concise closed-form answer in Lean according to the syntax, it should be an explicit number, namely 1, which directly results from the minimal sum over configurations.

Because the sum of all pairwise products equals (∑ s(i))^2, and the minimal possible (∑ s(i))^2 is 1, the minimal total sum of the double summation is 1.

Therefore:

<<<(∑ i : Fin 95, s i) ^ 2>>>

with the minimal value being 1.

**Final Answer:**

<<<1>>>

This captures the minimal double summation value as the minimal squared sum of ±1 entries, acknowledging the sum can’t be zero for odd n, hence the least is 1.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

However, to present a concise closed-form answer in Lean according to the syntax, it should be an explicit number, namely 1, which directly results from the minimal sum over configurations.

Because the sum of all pairwise products equals (∑ s(i))^2, and the minimal possible (∑ s(i))^2 is 1, the minimal total sum of the double summation is 1.

The main errors are due to trying to directly write a summation notation within Lean's syntax, which requires explicit expressions rather than LaTeX or summation symbols. The minimal sum over s(i) is actually 1 because the s(i) are either 1 or -1, and the sum ∑ s(i) has minimal absolute square value when the sum of s(i) is ±1, since all zero summations would cancel out. The sum ∑_{i=1}^{95} s(i) can be either 1 or -1 in the minimal case. Therefore, the minimal value of the sum of pairwise products, which is (∑ s(i))^2, is 1.

Given the pattern, the answer should be a fixed real number, specifically 1, in Lean syntax. So, the fixed answer should be:

```lean
abbrev mathodyssey76_answer : ℝ := 1
```

and in the `IsLeast` statement, the corresponding value should be `1`.

**Final fixed answer:**

<<<1>>>

This concise expression encapsulates the minimal sum's square value, which is 1, matching the analysis and making the Lean code compile correctly.
