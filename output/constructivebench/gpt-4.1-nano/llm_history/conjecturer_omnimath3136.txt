abbrev omnimath3136_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3136 : 
  Nat.card {p : ℕ | 0 < p ∧ -1 < sqrt p - sqrt 100 ∧ sqrt p - sqrt 100 < 1} = omnimath3136_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The set describes all p such that sqrt p is within 1 of sqrt 100 = 10, i.e., p in (9, 11). The integers p in this range are 10 only. Thus, there is exactly one such p.  
Answer: <<<1>>>
