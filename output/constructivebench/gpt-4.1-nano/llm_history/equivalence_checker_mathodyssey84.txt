theorem mathodyssey84 (a b : ℝ) (h : ∃ (x y : ℝ), x^2 / 7 - y^2 / 5 = 1 ∧ a * x + b * y + 1 = 0 ∧
    ∃ (m : ℝ), (2 * x / 7 - 2 * y / 5 * m = 0) ∧ (m * (-a / b) = -1)) :

Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => 7 / a^2 - 5 / b^2
Proposed Answer: fun a b => 144* b^2 / a^2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding a function mathodyssey84_answer(a,b) that satisfies certain conditions involving hyperbolas and tangent lines.

2. The ground truth answer is a function that clearly shows the relationship between a and b based on the given conditions: 7/a² - 5/b².

3. The proposed answer is 144*b²/a², which is a completely different form.

Key differences:
- The ground truth has two terms (7/a² and -5/b²) while the proposed answer has just one term.
- The ground truth has a subtraction operation, while the proposed answer is a single fraction.
- The numerical coefficients and structure are completely different.

There's no mathematical transformation that can convert 7/a² - 5/b² into 144*b²/a², so these are not equivalent answers.
