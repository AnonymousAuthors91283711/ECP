The problem seeks the minimal such c with the specified conditions. The pattern suggests c is of the form 2b−a, with the other conditions implying symmetric equidistance and a multiplicative relation c * a = b^2. The minimal c appears when choosing the smallest positive a, which is a=1; then b = c/2. The conditions reduce to c * 1 = (c/2)^2, leading to c^2/4 = c, i.e., c = 4. 

Thus, the minimal c satisfying all conditions is 4.
