Based on the pattern in the enumerated answers and the constraints, the maximum sum \( s \) that can be achieved under the given disjoint subdivision conditions is when \( S = \{1, 2, \dots, 12\} \) with sum \( \frac{12 \times 13}{2} = 78 \). The other configurations cannot exceed this sum, considering the divisibility constraints are designed such that the maximum sum is for the full set. 

Therefore,

<<<78>>>
