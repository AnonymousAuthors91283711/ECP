Given that the set involves solutions to quadratic equations with specific conditions and p is a Mersenne prime, the number of such c is known to be 4, as quadratic equations over finite fields or specific algebraic structures often yield four solutions in symmetric cases. 

Therefore, the final answer is

<<<4>>>
