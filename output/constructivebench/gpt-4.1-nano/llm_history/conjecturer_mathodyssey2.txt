Given the pattern in the enumerated answers involving powers of 5 and the indices, and the structure of A being a product over a range with bounds involving 4l and constants, the least l satisfying P l likely corresponds to the smallest exponent where 5^ (25*l) divides A l but 5^ (25*l + 1) does not. This pattern suggests the answer relates directly to l=0, capturing the minimal such case.

Hence, the closed form answer is:

<<<0>>>
