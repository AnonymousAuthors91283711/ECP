I conjecture the answer involves the primes (2, 3, 7). From the enumerated pattern, these primes satisfy the divisibility conditions: 2∣3^7+1, 3∣7^2+1, and 7∣2^3+1. The pattern suggests that the only such triplet is (2, 3, 7), possibly with permutations. Therefore, the answer set is all permutations of (2, 3, 7).
