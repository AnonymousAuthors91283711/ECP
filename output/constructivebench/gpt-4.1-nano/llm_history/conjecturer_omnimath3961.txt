The system of equations suggests symmetry among a, b, and c. Substituting, they imply a certain cyclic relation. Based on patterns from solutions, the consistent solution is when a, b, c are zero or satisfy special relations. The simplest non-trivial solution (excluding zero) indicates that a * b * c equals 1, as a common value satisfying the equations is when a = b = c = 1 or their negatives, leading to the product 1 or -1. Considering positive solutions, the answer is 1.
