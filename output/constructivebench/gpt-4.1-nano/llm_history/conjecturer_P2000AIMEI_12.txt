The conditions imply symmetry around x=23 and x=199, establishing that f is symmetric on [0,46] and [0,398], with the overlapping point at x=23. The maximum number of distinct values of g corresponds to selecting as many distinct values as possible under these symmetries, which is 46. Hence, the maximal n is 46,
