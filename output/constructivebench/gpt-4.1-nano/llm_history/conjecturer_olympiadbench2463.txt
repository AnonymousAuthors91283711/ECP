The partitions correspond to the divisors of 64, where each partition's elements multiply to 64, and the count is the number of such partitions. The number of divisors for 64 (which is 2^6) is 6 + 1 = 7, but including partition structures, total counts align with powers of 2, summing to 32. The answer is 32.
