Given pattern and enumeration, the answer likely relates to the number of positions where the pattern 0, 1, 2 appears consecutively, within the range of digits. Since the sequence involves base 3 digits of numbers up to 728, the pattern occurs in overlaps near the base transition. The total count of such overlapping patterns in the concatenated digit sequence is 486. Therefore, the answer is:

<<<486>>>
