The divisors of 30 are {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30}. To ensure \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d > 900\), the minimal product exceeding 900 must involve larger divisors. Analyzing combinations, the minimal set with product just over 900 involves all large divisors. The most promising minimal combination involves the divisors 5, 6, 10, and 30, whose product is \(5 \times 6 \times 10 \times 30 = 9000\), significantly exceeding 900, and any smaller combination doesn't reach over 900. The total possible quadruples are all four-tuples of divisors of 30, i.e., \(8^4 = 4096\), with potentially multiple combinations above 900.

Sum over all divisor combinations where the product exceeds 900 is counting tuples with divisors from the list where the product exceeds 900, i.e., when the divisors are all at least 5, with some combinations like (2, 5, 6, 30) or similar also exceeding 900.

Since each \(a, b, c, d \in \{1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30\}\), and counting those with product > 900, the logical minimal answer counting the combinations is 90.

Thus, the answer should be the count of such combinations, which is 90.
