Ground Truth Answer: 5/2
Proposed Answer: (1 : ℚ) + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12 + 1/24
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the sum of reciprocals of all non-zero divisors of 24.

2. The divisors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.

3. The proposed answer lists exactly these reciprocals: 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12 + 1/24.

4. Calculating this sum:
   1 + 0.5 = 1.5
   1.5 + 0.333... ≈ 1.833...
   1.833... + 0.25 = 2.083...
   2.083... + 0.166... ≈ 2.25
   2.25 + 0.125 = 2.375
   2.375 + 0.083... ≈ 2.458...
   2.458... + 0.0416... ≈ 2.5 (which is 5/2)

5. The ground truth answer is 5/2, which equals 2.5, matching our calculation.

The proposed answer is exactly the expanded form of the ground truth answer, and when computed, it equals 5/2.
