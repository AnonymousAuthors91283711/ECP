theorem omnimath75 (m : ℕ) (hm : 0 < m) :
  (∃ p, Prime p ∧ ∀ n, ¬p ∣ (n^m - m)) ↔ m ∈ omnimath75_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests m must be 1 for the divisibility condition to hold (since for p prime dividing n^m - m, p doesn't divide m). Thus, the answer set is {1}.
