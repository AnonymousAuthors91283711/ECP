The expressions indicate x must satisfy inequalities involving rational functions derived from quadratic polynomials. After analyzing the pattern, the critical points are x where the quadratic numerator changes sign, i.e., roots at √11 and -√11, avoiding x = -1 where the denominator is zero. The interval between -√11 and √11, excluding -1, satisfies the inequalities.
