Given the structure, the sum involves `min (a i) (b j)` over disjoint ranges that cover 1 to 40, with minimal pairs. The pairing ensures the minimum covers all values from 1 up to 40, and since `a` and `b` range over 1 to 20 without overlap, the sum's maximum occurs when `min (a i) (b j)` achieves the highest possible sum over these ranges. Noting the pattern, the sum is maximized when `a i` and `b j` span the numbers 1 to 20 as evenly as possible, pairing each value 1..20 with its complement to reach 40. The maximal sum thus becomes 20 * 21 / 2 + 20 * 21 / 2 = 420. 

In the sum, the total sums over such disjoint pairings best sum to 420.

Answer:

<<<420>>>
