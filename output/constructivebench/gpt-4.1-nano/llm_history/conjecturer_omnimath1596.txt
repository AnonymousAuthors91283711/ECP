  (∀ x > 0, ∀ y > 0, f ((c + 1) * x + f y) = f (x + 2 * y) + 2 * c * x) ↔ f = omnimath1596_answer c := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
Given the functional equation and positivity conditions, the pattern suggests a linear form involving the argument scaled by constants, possibly \(f(x) = kx\). Analyzing the dependence on \(c\), the general solution likely involves \(f(x) = \alpha x\).  
Final answer: <<<fun c x => c * x>>>
