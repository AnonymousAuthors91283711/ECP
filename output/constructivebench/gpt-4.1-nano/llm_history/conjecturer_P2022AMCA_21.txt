The polynomial \(\ X^{2022} + X^{1011} + 1 \) resembles a cyclotomic polynomial related to roots of unity, particularly due to the exponents and the structure suggesting a factorization involving primitive roots. Given the pattern and typical factorizations, the polynomial likely factors over \(\mathbb Z \) into cyclotomic polynomials corresponding to roots of unity whose orders divide something related to 2022. Since the polynomial is degree 2022, and the exponents 2022 and 1011 are related (1011 divides 2022), a natural candidate for the answer would be a cyclotomic polynomial associated with 3rd roots of unity. The minimal polynomial for primitive 3rd roots over \(\mathbb Z\) is \(X^2 + X + 1\) which divides \(X^3 - 1\). The polynomial resembles the factorization structure of \(X^{3k} + 1\) when \(k\) is a multiple, so a plausible final answer pulled from known cyclotomic factors is \(X^2 + X + 1\).
