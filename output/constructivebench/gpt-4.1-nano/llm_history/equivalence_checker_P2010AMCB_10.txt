Ground Truth Answer: 50 / 101
Proposed Answer: (4950 / 10001)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem involves solving for x in the equation:
   (sum_{n=0}^{98} (n+1) + x)/101 = 100x

2. The sum sum_{n=0}^{98} (n+1) is the sum of the first 99 natural numbers (1 to 99), which equals 99*100/2 = 4950.

3. So the equation becomes: (4950 + x)/101 = 100x

4. Solving this:
   4950 + x = 10100x
   4950 = 10099x
   x = 4950/10099

5. The ground truth answer is 50/101 ≈ 0.4950495
   The proposed answer is 4950/10001 ≈ 0.4949505

6. These are clearly different values (though numerically close), and the correct solution should be x = 4950/10099 ≈ 0.4901475.

The proposed answer is incorrect - it's neither equal to the ground truth nor the correct solution.
