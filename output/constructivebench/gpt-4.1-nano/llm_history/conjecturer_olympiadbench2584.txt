The given equation involves logarithms with bases related to `2*x` and `3*x`, with constraints that `2*x > 0`, `3*x > 0`, and the bases are not 1. This strongly suggests symmetry when `2*x` and `3*x` are proportional in a way that makes the logs equal, leading to a ratio between `2*x` and `3*x`.

From the enumeration hints, the pattern indicates the solution will be the unique `x` satisfying the proportionality implied by the equality of logs.

The solution simplifies to a ratio where the logs are equal when `2*x` and `3*x` are related via their bases, resulting in:

$$
x = \frac{\sqrt[6]{8}}{\sqrt[6]{27}} = \frac{2^{1/2}}{3^{1/2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3}}
$$

The main error in your proposed answer `(real.sqrt 2) / (real.sqrt 3)` is that Lean's mathlib uses `sqrt` (lowercase) as the function name, not `real.sqrt`. Additionally, `sqrt` is defined within the `Real` namespace, often just available via `sqrt` without qualification if `open Real` is used. The `noncomputable` abbreviation can directly use `sqrt 2` and `sqrt 3`, assuming the `sqrt` function is in scope.

Also, since the problem involves log base expressions and certain symmetry, the candidate answer being the ratio of square roots makes sense. The recommended correction is to replace `real.sqrt` with `sqrt`, possibly qualified with `Real.` if needed.

Considering the enumerated answers and pattern, the concise closed-form that fits the structure is:

<<<(sqrt 2) / (sqrt 3)>>

This form is simple, well-defined, and matches the patterns in typical answers involving radicals in such logarithmic inequalities.

**Explanation**:  
- `sqrt` is the standard notation for square root in Lean's `mathlib`.  
- The answer is a positive real number.  
- The ratio `(sqrt 2) / (sqrt 3)` simplifies to `sqrt(2/3)`, which appears natural for expressions involving ratios of constants 2 and 3, especially in the context of logarithmic identities.

In conclusion, the fixed answer is:

<<<(sqrt 2) / (sqrt 3)>>>

The proposed answer `(sqrt 2) / (sqrt 3)` is valid in Lean and common in expressing ratios involving radicals. To fix the error, wrap the answer in parentheses and ensure it is a proper `ℝ` expression. Therefore, the correct fixed expression should be:

<<<(sqrt 2) / (sqrt 3)>>>

This ensures the expression is well-defined, uses standard Lean notation, and matches the form of typical radical ratios involved in such logarithmic equations.
