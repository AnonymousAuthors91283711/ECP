The sum involves logs with respect to base 10, and the sum over k from 0 to 99 of ⌊log_10(k+1) + log_10(n)⌋ ≤ 300. The largest value of n would be when the sum is just under or equal to 300, with the maximum possible sum when log_10(n) is large, and the sum over log_10(k+1) yields the total contribution of each digit length.

Estimating the sum of logs:
- For k+1 in [1..9], log_10(k+1) ≈ 0..1, 9 terms.
- For [10..99], log_10(k+1) ≈ 1..2, 90 terms.
Sum of logs:
- Sum over 1..9 roughly ≈ sum of (log_10(k+1)); similarly for 10..99.

Approximate sum:
- For the smaller range: sum ≈ 9*1
- For larger: sum ≈ 90*2

Total ≈ 9*1 + 90*2 ≈ 9 + 180 = 189 plus contributions of log_10(n).

To reach sum ≤ 300, log_10(n) scaled sum should be less than or equal to about 111 (since the total of logs from 1..99 is 189), so log_10(n) ≤ (300 - 189)/number_of_terms ≈ 111/189 ≈ 0.588.

Thus, n ≤ 10^{0.588} ≈ 3.88, roughly 4.

Final answer in Lean:
<<<4>>>
