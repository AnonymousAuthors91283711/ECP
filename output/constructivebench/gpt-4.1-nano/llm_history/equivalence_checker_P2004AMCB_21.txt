Ground Truth Answer: 7/2
Proposed Answer: (3 + sqrt 17) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find the sum of the maximum and minimum values of y/x for positive x,y satisfying the given quadratic equation.

2. The ground truth answer is 7/2 (3.5).

3. The proposed answer is (3 + sqrt(17))/2 ≈ (3 + 4.123)/2 ≈ 3.5615.

These are clearly different numerical values. The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the ground truth answer of 7/2.
