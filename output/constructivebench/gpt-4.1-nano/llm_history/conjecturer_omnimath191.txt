To find a closed-form for the answer, observe the sum equalities: they resemble geometric series equations. The sum yields (u) and (v) satisfying particular polynomial equations. Considering the structure, the solutions appear to relate to roots of these polynomials leading to specific values. The pattern indicates solutions involve roots of the respective equations derived from the sums, possibly the roots of polynomial equations associated with the geometric series sum minus the constant terms. 

Hence probable explicit solutions are functions involving the roots of the polynomial equations related to the geometric sums: 

\[ x = \frac{1 - u^{n+1}}{1 - u} \]

and similar for v. Given the patterns and the constraints, the solutions are possibly the fixed points of these geometric series sums, which are specific roots, often the principal roots of unity related to the sum’s polynomial. 

So the closed form for the answer, considering the structure and typical solutions, is: 

<<<fun u v => (u ^ 8 = 1) ∧ (v ^ 10 = 1)>>>
