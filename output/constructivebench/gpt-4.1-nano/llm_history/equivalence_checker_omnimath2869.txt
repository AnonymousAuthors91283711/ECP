Ground Truth Answer: 12
Proposed Answer: 11
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have two equations:
   - 10x + y = 75
   - 10y + x = 57

2. We can solve this system of equations:
   - From the first equation: y = 75 - 10x
   - Substitute into second equation: 10(75-10x) + x = 57
   - 750 - 100x + x = 57
   - -99x = -693
   - x = 7

3. Then y = 75 - 10*7 = 5

4. Therefore x + y = 7 + 5 = 12

The ground truth answer is correct (12), while the proposed answer is 11, which is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
