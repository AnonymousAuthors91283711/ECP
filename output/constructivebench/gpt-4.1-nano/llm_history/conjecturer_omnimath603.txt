  Finset.card (Finset.filter (fun k => k^k % 10 = 1) (Finset.Icc 1 2013)) = omnimath603_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern in the enumerations suggests counting integers between 1 and 2013 whose last digit of k^k is 1. Analyzing last digits of k^k for k mod 10 indicates a cycle with k mod 10 = 1, 3, 7, 9 yield last digit 1. Counting such k gives 4 complete residue classes, each contributing roughly 201 numbers between 1 and 2013. Exact calculation: 4 * floor(2013/10) + counting remaining terms, totaling 805.
