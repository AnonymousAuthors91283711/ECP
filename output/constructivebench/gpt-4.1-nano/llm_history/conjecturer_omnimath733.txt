The conditions imply n's digit sum equals twice its length, length ≤ 12, all digits at even positions are even, and n is divisible by 210. Since divisibility by 210 requires factors 2, 3, 5, the last digit is divisible by 10, and the sum of digits divisible by 3. The digit sum condition repairs to sum \( 2 \times \text{length} \), with length ≤ 12, so the possible values for \( \text{length} \) are from 1 to 12. Final set includes numbers with the last digit 0, all other digits even or odd as per the digit sum behaving. The smallest candidate is when all digits are 0 except last, giving n=10, but sum constraints rule this. The pattern indicates these are numbers divisible by 210 with specific digit properties. 

Hence, the final answer: 

<<<{ n : ℕ | n % 210 = 0 ∧ (digits 10 n).sum = 2 * (digits 10 n).length }>>>
