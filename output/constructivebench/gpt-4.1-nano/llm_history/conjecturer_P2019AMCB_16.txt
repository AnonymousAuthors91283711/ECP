  p 0 = P2019AMCB_16_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The pattern suggests p aligns with values defining a recurrence with initial conditions, in particular p(0)=1, p(3)=0, p(6)=0, p(10)=1, p(11)=0. Given the symmetry and recursion relation, the sequence resembles a polynomial solution with roots at 3 and 6, and boundary at 0 and 10. This corresponds to a quadratic form scaled appropriately, leading to a constant value over those roots, with the overall behavior captured by a quadratic polynomial scaled by 1/30.
