Ground Truth Answer: {1}
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | n > 0 ∧ n % 2 = 0}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

The problem asks to find all natural numbers n > 0 such that there exists an integer x satisfying the equation:
x^n + (2 + x)^n + (2 - x)^n = 0

Ground Truth Answer: {1} (only n=1 satisfies the condition)
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | n > 0 ∧ n % 2 = 0} (all positive even numbers)

Let's test n=1:
For x=-1: (-1)^1 + (2-1)^1 + (2-(-1))^1 = -1 + 1 + 3 = 3 ≠ 0
For x=-2: (-2)^1 + (0)^1 + (4)^1 = -2 + 0 + 4 = 2 ≠ 0
Actually, no integer x satisfies the equation for n=1, so the ground truth answer appears incorrect.

Now test n=2 (even number):
x^2 + (2+x)^2 + (2-x)^2 = x^2 + (4+4x+x^2) + (4-4x+x^2) = 3x^2 + 8
This equals 0 when 3x^2 = -8, which has no real (let alone integer) solutions.

Similarly for any even n, all terms are non-negative and at least two are positive, so their sum cannot be zero.

The proposed answer is incorrect because no even n satisfies the condition. The correct answer should be empty set ∅, as no n > 0 satisfies the condition with integer x.
