Ground Truth Answer: 11
Proposed Answer: 20
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n that satisfies certain conditions involving r, y, and b with given constraints.

2. The conditions imply that (10 - r) = (7 - y) = (3 - b), meaning all three differences must be equal. Let's call this common difference d.

3. The expression for n simplifies to n = 3d since it's the sum of three equal differences.

4. The constraints give us:
   - r ≤ 10 ⇒ d = 10 - r ≥ 0
   - y ≤ 7 ⇒ d = 7 - y ≥ 0
   - b ≤ 3 ⇒ d = 3 - b ≥ 0

5. The maximum possible d is limited by the smallest constraint, which is b ≤ 3 ⇒ d ≤ 3.

6. The minimal n would occur at the smallest possible d > 0, which is d=1 ⇒ n=3*1=3. However, we need to check if this is achievable.

7. For d=1:
   - r = 9 (since 10-9=1)
   - y = 6 (since 7-6=1)
   - b = 2 (since 3-2=1)
   This satisfies all constraints.

8. Therefore, the minimal n should be 3, not 11 or 20.

The ground truth answer (11) and proposed answer (20) are both incorrect, but they are also not equivalent to each other.
