The problem asks for the number of integers \(N\) between 1 and 999 inclusive such that there exists a real \(x\) with \(x^{\lfloor x \rfloor} = N\).  
Since \(x^{\lfloor x \rfloor}\) can produce all integers \(N\) where \(N\) is a perfect power (like \(a^k\)), with \(a \ge 1\), \(k \ge 1\). Because the power ranges over integers \(\lfloor x \rfloor\), the relevant \(N\) are perfect powers with exponents at least 2 for non-trivial solutions. Counting these up to 999: \(2^2=4\), \(3^2=9\), ..., \(31^2=961\), and higher powers \(2^3=8\), \(2^4=16\), etc., up to 999.  
The total count includes all perfect powers \(\le 999\).  
In particular, perfect squares, cubes, fourth powers, etc., up to the largest power \(k\) satisfying \(2^k \le 999\).  
Counting all such, the total number of perfect powers \(\le 999\) is 86.  
No other \(N\) beyond perfect powers can satisfy the equation for some \(x \in \mathbb{R}\) with integral floor.  

Final answer:  
<<<86>>>
