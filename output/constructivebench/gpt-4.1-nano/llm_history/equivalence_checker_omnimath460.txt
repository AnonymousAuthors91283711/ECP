Ground Truth Answer: 211
Proposed Answer: 401
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us:
   - p is a prime between 100 and 500
   - e = 2016 mod (p-1)
   - e - (1/2*(p-1)) = 21

2. For the ground truth answer p=211:
   - p-1 = 210
   - 2016 mod 210 = 126 (since 210*9=1890, 2016-1890=126)
   - e = 126
   - 126 - (210/2) = 126 - 105 = 21 (matches the condition)

3. For the proposed answer p=401:
   - p-1 = 400
   - 2016 mod 400 = 16 (since 400*5=2000, 2016-2000=16)
   - e = 16
   - 16 - (400/2) = 16 - 200 = -184 ≠ 21 (doesn't match)

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the given conditions, while the ground truth answer does.
