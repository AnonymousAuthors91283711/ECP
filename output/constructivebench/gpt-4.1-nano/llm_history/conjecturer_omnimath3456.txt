abbrev omnimath3456_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3456 :
  Real.sqrt (3 ^ 3 + 3 ^ 3 + 3 ^ 3) = omnimath3456_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests summing powers over symmetric terms; since the sum inside the square root simplifies to \(3 \times 3^3 = 3^4 = 81\), then \(\sqrt{81} = 9\).  
Final answer: <<<2 * 3>>>
