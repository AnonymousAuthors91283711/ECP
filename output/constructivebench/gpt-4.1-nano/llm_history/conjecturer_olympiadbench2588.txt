The functions A k and B k form a symmetric nonlinear recurrence with initial conditions. From the pattern, the sequence A involves alternating components and grows linearly with alternating signs. The key values suggest that beyond index 3, the sequence continues with a pattern involving powers of 2 and alternating signs. The explicit pattern is A 4 = 4, matching the sum of previous influences.
