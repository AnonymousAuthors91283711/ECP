theorem P2004AMCB_5 : 
  (∃ d : ℕ, 10 * d / 7 - 60 = d) ∧ 
  (∀ d', 10 * d' / 7 - 60 = d' → d' = P2004AMCB_5_answer) ∧ 
  (digits 10 P2004AMCB_5_answer).sum = 5 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Since 10 * d / 7 - 60 = d implies d = 5, and sum of digits equals 5, the unique answer is d = 5. 

Thus, the final answer in Lean form:

<<<5>>>
