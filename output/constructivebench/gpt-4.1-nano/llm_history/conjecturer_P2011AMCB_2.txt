theorem P2011AMCB_2 : 
  IsLeast {x : ℕ | (90 + 80 + 70 + 60 + 85 + x) / 6 ≥ (90 + 80 + 70 + 60 + 85) / 5 + 3} P2011AMCB_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The average of six scores is at least 3 points higher than the average of five scores (excluding x). Calculating, the mean of first five scores is 75, so the total of first five scores is 375. We require:

(375 + x)/6 ≥ 75 + 3 → 375 + x ≥ 6*78 → 375 + x ≥ 468 → x ≥ 93. 

So, the minimal ℕ that satisfies this is 93.

<<<93>>>
