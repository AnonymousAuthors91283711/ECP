Ground Truth Answer: {(7, 1), (1, 7), (22, 22)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 7), (7, 1), (2, 2)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all positive integer pairs (x,y) that satisfy:
   x > 0 ∧ y > 0 ∧ x³ + y³ = x² + 42xy + y²

2. Ground Truth Answer provides three pairs: (7,1), (1,7), and (22,22)

3. Proposed Answer provides three different pairs: (1,7), (7,1), and (2,2)

Let's check the proposed pairs:
- (1,7): 1³ + 7³ = 1 + 343 = 344; 1² + 42*1*7 + 7² = 1 + 294 + 49 = 344 ✓
- (7,1): Symmetric to above, so also correct ✓
- (2,2): 2³ + 2³ = 8 + 8 = 16; 2² + 42*2*2 + 2² = 4 + 168 + 4 = 176 ≠ 16 ✗

The pair (2,2) doesn't satisfy the equation, while the correct pair (22,22) is missing:
- (22,22): 22³ + 22³ = 10648 + 10648 = 21296; 22² + 42*22*22 + 22² = 484 + 20328 + 484 = 21296 ✓

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It includes an invalid pair (2,2)
2. It misses the valid pair (22,22)

<<<False>>>
