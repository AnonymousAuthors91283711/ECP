Based on the pattern in the enumeration, the value of t equals q1Yes - q2Yes + q3Yes, thus: 

<<<q1Yes - q2Yes + q3Yes>>>

This expression satisfies the constraints and consolidates the personal components T, L, A from the given sums.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The primary issue in your code is that in the definition of `P2022AMCA_9_answer`, you are trying to use `q1Yes`, `q2Yes`, and `q3Yes` before they are in scope or defined as variables. Instead, you should define `P2022AMCA_9_answer` as an expression in terms of the variables `t`, `l`, and `a`, or directly compute a constant value based on the known equations.

Based on the problem statement, the variables `t`, `l`, and `a` are related via the equations:

- `t + l + a = 31`
- `t + a = 22`
- `a + l = 15`
- `t + l = 9`

From these, we can find a consistent sum:

Adding `t + a = 22` and `a + l = 15` gives:

`t + a + a + l = 22 + 15 => t + 2a + l = 37`

But since `t + l + a = 31`, subtracting, we get:

`(t + 2a + l) - (t + l + a) = 37 - 31 => a = 6`

Now, knowing `a = 6`, and `t + a = 22`, then:

`t + 6 = 22` → `t = 16`

Similarly, from `a + l = 15`, and `a = 6`, then:

`6 + l = 15` → `l = 9`

Finally, the quantity we are asked to compute is `t`, which is `16`.

Hence, the answer simplifies to `16`.

In Lean, the definition should be independent of the variables `q1Yes`, `q2Yes`, and `q3Yes`, which are just the problem data. We can directly encode the constant answer:

<<<16>>>

Explanation: The algebraic relations derived from the equations provide the specific value for `t`, which is 16. This allows us to give a closed form answer as the constant number 16.
