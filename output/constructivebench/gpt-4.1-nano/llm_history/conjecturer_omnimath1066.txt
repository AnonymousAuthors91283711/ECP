Given the problem, the set describes numbers less than 4,300,000,000 that are either 1 or the product of a power of 2 and a product of Fermat primes. The Fermat primes are known: 3, 5, 17, 257, 65537. The maximum product of all five is well over the limit, but the largest valid subset under the limit is obtained when multiplying some subset of these Fermat primes with powers of 2. The maximum is obtained by multiplying all Fermat primes with appropriate 2's because exponents of Fermat primes grow quickly.

Adding the known Fermat primes:

- \( 3 = 2^{2^0} + 1 \)
- \( 5 = 2^{2^1} + 1 \)
- \( 17 = 2^{2^2} + 1 \)
- \( 257 = 2^{2^3} + 1 \)
- \( 65537 = 2^{2^4} + 1 \)

The product \( F.prod id \) with all five primes multiplied by some power of 2 yields the maximum under 4,300,000,000:

\[
n = 2^k \times 3 \times 5 \times 17 \times 257 \times 65537
\]

The product of all Fermat primes:

\[
3 \times 5 \times 17 \times 257 \times 65537 = 4294967297
\]

We seek the highest k such that:

\[
2^k \times 4294967297 < 4300000000
\]
which gives \( 2^k \times 4294967297 < 4.3 \times 10^{9} \).

Dividing:

\[
2^k < \frac{4.3 \times 10^{9}}{4294967297} \approx 1
\]

So, \( k=0 \).

Thus, the maximal n:

\[
n = 4294967297
\]

which is less than 4,300,000,000.

**Answer in Lean:**

<<<4294967297>>>
