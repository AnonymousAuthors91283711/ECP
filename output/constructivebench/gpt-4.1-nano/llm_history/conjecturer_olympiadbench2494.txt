    (P : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → Prop)
    (hP : P = fun a x y => (Real.sin x) ^ 2 + (Real.cos y) ^ 2 = 3 / 2 * a ∧ (Real.cos x) ^ 2 + (Real.sin y) ^ 2 = 1 / 2 * a ^ 2) :

The equations suggest a relation between a, sin²x, cos²x, and similarly for y, with known Pythagorean identities. For values satisfying the given system, the consistent solution for a is a constant derived from the sum of squares, leading to a = √3, since summing the identities: sin²x + cos²x = 1, and the relations balance at a = √3.
