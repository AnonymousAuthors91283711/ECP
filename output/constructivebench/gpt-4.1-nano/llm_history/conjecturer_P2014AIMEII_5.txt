The problem involves roots of cubic polynomials and their transformations, pointwise evaluating at shifted roots. The key insight is that for specific shifts in roots and coefficients, the absolute value of \(b\) following certain algebraic relations simplifies to a constant value. Based on the pattern in the enumerated answers, the consistent answer (common in problems involving absolute values and symmetric roots) is 240. 

<<<240>>>
