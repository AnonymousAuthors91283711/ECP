(hsin : Real.sin A + Real.sin B = 1)
(hcos : Real.cos A + Real.cos B = 3 / 2)
: Real.cos (A - B) = omnimath1599_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the sum conditions, the values of sin and cos suggest specific angles. Recognizing that cos(A−B) can be expressed via cos A cos B + sin A sin B and substituting the given sums, the resulting expression simplifies to a fixed value. The pattern from enumerations indicates the answer is 1/2.
