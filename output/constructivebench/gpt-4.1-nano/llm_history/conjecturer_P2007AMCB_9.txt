The functional equation relates f(3x - 1) to a quadratic in x, suggesting substitution to express f in terms of x. Recognizing the pattern, simplify with x = (t+1)/3, then derive explicit form. Final simplified expression for f(5) after substitution and algebra yields:  

f(5) = ( ( (5 + 1)/3 )^2 ) + ( (5 + 1)/3 ) + 1 = (2)^2 + 2 + 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.  

Hence, the closed form without variables is 7.

The core of the problem is to find an explicit formula for the function f given the functional equation \(f(3x - 1) = x^2 + x + 1\). The given hints use substitution to express f in terms of x, then evaluate at a specific input, namely f(5). The key steps involve expression substitution and algebraic simplification.

The error in the original answer stems from the fact that it is written as a natural language explanation rather than an actual Lean expression. To correct this, I will generate a closed-form formula for \(f(t)\) in terms of t, derived from the given functional relation, then evaluate at \(t=5\). The approach involves solving the relation for arbitrary t:

1. Express \(f(t)\) in terms of x: set \(t = 3x - 1\), so \(x = \frac{t+1}{3}\).

2. Plug this back into \(f(3x-1)\), thus:
\[
f(t) = \left(\frac{t+1}{3}\right)^2 + \frac{t+1}{3} + 1
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
f(t) = \frac{(t+1)^2}{9} + \frac{t+1}{3} + 1
\]

3. Evaluation at \(t=5\):

\[
f(5) = \frac{(5+1)^2}{9} + \frac{5+1}{3} + 1 = \frac{36}{9} + 2 + 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
\]

I will now encode this directly in Lean, as an explicit closed-form expression, for the answer, fixing earlier syntax errors:

- Use a lambda function for the explicit formula of f, evaluated at 5.

- The answer is a real number, 7, represented as a rational value within ℝ.

Final code:

<<<( ( (5 + 1) ^ 2 ) / 9 + (5 + 1) / 3 + 1 )>>>

Because the formula is a uniform closed form for all t, it can be generalized as:

\(f(t) = \frac{(t+1)^2}{9} + \frac{t+1}{3} + 1\)

and thus, at \(t=5\):

<<<(( (5 + 1)^2 ) / 9 + (5 + 1) / 3 + 1)>>>

This simplifies numerically to 7, matching the previous calculation.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error indicates that the definition of `P2007AMCB_9_answer` involves real division which Lean considers noncomputable, and thus the abbreviation cannot be interpreted directly as a value without declaring it as `noncomputable`. To resolve this, I will declare the abbreviation as noncomputable, which allows defining real expressions involving division.

Looking at the enumerated answer and the structure of the expression: `( ( (5 + 1) ^ 2 ) / 9 + (5 + 1) / 3 + 1 )`, it simplifies to:
- `(6^2)/9 + 6/3 + 1` which is `36/9 + 2 + 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7`.

This suggests the result is 7 and the original expression conveys the same.

Therefore, I will define `P2007AMCB_9_answer` as `7`, and mark it as noncomputable to avoid compilation errors.

My reasoning: The problem involves a functional equation `f(3x - 1) = x^2 + x + 1`. To find `f(5)`:
- Set `3x - 1 = 5` => `3x = 6` => `x = 2`.
- So, `f(5) = 2^2 + 2 + 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7`.

Thus, the answer is `7`.

**Proposed final answer:**

<<<noncomputable def P2007AMCB_9_answer : ℝ := 7>>>

**Explanation:**  
Since the given expression simplifies to 7, and defining this value involves division in real numbers (which Lean treats as noncomputable), declaring the definition as `noncomputable` allows the code to compile. The derivation confirms the answer is 7.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error occurs because the current declaration combines an abbreviation `abbrev` with a `noncomputable def`, which is invalid syntax. Also, the abbreviation `P2007AMCB_9_answer` is already declared as an `abbrev`. To fix this, I suggest replacing the `abbrev` with a `noncomputable def` directly, which allows us to specify a computed real value explicitly where reasoning or computation is involved. Since the answer is simply 7 (a constant), we do not need to define an actual function; we can initialize it as a constant. Given the context, declaring `P2007AMCB_9_answer` as a `noncomputable def` instead of `abbrev` resolves the syntax issue and avoids redeclaration errors.

The pattern from the enumerated answers shows the solution is a specific real number, which is 7.
