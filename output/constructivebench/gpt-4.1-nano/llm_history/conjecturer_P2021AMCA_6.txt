  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∃ (r b : ℕ), r + b = n ∧ r / (r + b) = 1/3 ∧ r / (r + b + 4) = 1/4} P2021AMCA_6_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem involves finding the least n > 0 where r + b = n, and r/(r+b) = 1/3, r/(r+b+4)=1/4. From the ratios, r/(n)=1/3 → r=n/3, and r/(n+4)=1/4 → r=(n+4)/4. Equate the two: n/3 = (n+4)/4 → 4n=3n+12 → n=12. Then r=4 and b=8. 

Answer: <<<12>>>
