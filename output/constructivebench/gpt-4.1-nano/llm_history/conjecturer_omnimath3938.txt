  ↔ omnimath3938_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Bool
The problem asks whether such an injective function exists with the specified gcd preservation, and the enumerated answers suggest that the answer is false. The pattern indicates that no such function can exist, likely due to the constraints imposed by gcd preservation over a large finite range. Therefore, the concise answer should reflect the impossibility of such a function.

<<<false>>>
