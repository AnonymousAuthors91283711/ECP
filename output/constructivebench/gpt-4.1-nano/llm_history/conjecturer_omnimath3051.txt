The function satisfies f 2 = 5, f 3 = 7, and the multiplicative property. From these, infer f(12). Using the pattern in the enumeration, the formula resembles f(n) = 2n + 1 for positive n. Checking f(2) = 5 matches 2*2 +1=5; f(3)=7 matches 2*3+1=7, consistent with the property. Thus, f(12) = 2*12+1 = 25. 

<<<25>>>
