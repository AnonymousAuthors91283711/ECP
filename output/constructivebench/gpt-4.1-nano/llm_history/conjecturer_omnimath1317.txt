  (x + 1)/(x + 2) > (3*x + 4)/(2*x + 9) ↔ x ∈ omnimath1317_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The inequality simplifies to a quadratic in x, with critical points at x = -2 and x = -9/2, which divide the real line. Testing intervals shows the inequality holds when x < -9/2 or x > -2, avoiding the points where denominators vanish. Therefore, the solution set is ℝ \ {-2, -9/2}. The explicit set indefinitely excludes these points, which can be expressed as the union of intervals:

<<<{ x : ℝ | x < -9/2 } ∪ { x : ℝ | x > -2 }>>>
