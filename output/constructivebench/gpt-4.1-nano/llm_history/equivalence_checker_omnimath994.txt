Ground Truth Answer: 1999008 / 1999012
Proposed Answer: (8 * 2000) / ((8 * 2000) + 4)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem calculates a probability ratio involving color pairs:
   - sameColorPairs = sum of n*(n-1) for each color
   - redGreenPairs = 2*2 (special case)

2. Ground Truth:
   - sameColorPairs = 8*2*1 (for 8 colors with 2 items) + 2000*1999 = 16 + 3998000 = 3998016
   - redGreenPairs = 4
   - Total denominator = 3998016 + 4 = 3998020
   - Simplified fraction: 3998016/3998020 = 1999008/1999012 (divided numerator and denominator by 2)

3. Proposed Answer:
   - Claims sameColorPairs = 8*2000 = 16000 (incorrect)
   - Denominator = 16000 + 4 = 16004
   - This is completely wrong as it miscalculates the sameColorPairs term

The proposed answer incorrectly calculates the sameColorPairs term by using 8*2000 instead of properly summing n*(n-1) for all colors. The ground truth correctly accounts for both the small color pairs and the large copper pair.
