Ground Truth Answer: {1 / 2}
Proposed Answer: {-1/2, 0, 1/2, 2}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the set of x values in {-2, -1/2, 0, 1/2, 2} where x > x².

2. Let's evaluate each point:
   - x = -2: -2 > 4? False
   - x = -1/2: -0.5 > 0.25? False
   - x = 0: 0 > 0? False
   - x = 1/2: 0.5 > 0.25? True
   - x = 2: 2 > 4? False

3. The ground truth answer {1/2} is correct as it's the only value satisfying the condition.

4. The proposed answer {-1/2, 0, 1/2, 2} is incorrect because:
   - -1/2 doesn't satisfy the condition
   - 0 doesn't satisfy the condition
   - 2 doesn't satisfy the condition
   - Only 1/2 is correct

<<<False>>>
