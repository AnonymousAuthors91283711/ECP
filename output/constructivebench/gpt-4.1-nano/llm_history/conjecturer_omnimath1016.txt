The problem seeks the minimal \( n \) such that for all coprime \( m \), the order of \( m \) mod \( n \) is less than \( \phi(n)/10 \). The enumeration suggests the pattern that such \( n \) are prime powers where the order is initially small relative to \( \phi(n) \). Based on this, the minimal solution appears to be \( n = 361 \), which is \( 19^2 \) (a prime square), just larger than smaller prime powers. 

Final answer in lean:

<<<37^2>>>
