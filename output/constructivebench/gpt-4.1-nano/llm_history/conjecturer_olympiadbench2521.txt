    A ∈ olympiadbench2521_answer ↔
    ∃ (a b c : ℝ), a < b ∧ b < c ∧

    A = a * b / 2 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The pattern indicates the area is (a * b) / 2 of right triangles with consecutive side differences and a dime condition. The relevant value is when either side equals 60, ensuring the area is maximized or simplified. For symmetric cases, the area simplifies to 1800. 

<<<{60 * 120 / 2, 30 * 60 / 2, 120 * 180 / 2}>>>
