Ground Truth Answer: 7/72
Proposed Answer: (6 * (6^4 - 2 * 5^4 + 4^4)) / 6^4
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting functions from Fin 4 → Fin 6 where at least one output value appears at least 3 times, and then calculating its probability.

2. The ground truth answer is 7/72 ≈ 0.09722

3. The proposed answer is a complex expression: (6 * (6^4 - 2 * 5^4 + 4^4)) / 6^4

Let me evaluate the proposed answer:
- 6^4 = 1296
- 5^4 = 625 → 2*625 = 1250
- 4^4 = 256
- Numerator: 6*(1296 - 1250 + 256) = 6*(302) = 1812
- Denominator: 1296
- Fraction: 1812/1296 = 151/108 ≈ 1.398 (which is much larger than 7/72 ≈ 0.09722)

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth answer numerically, and the approach seems incorrect as it's counting something different (likely overcounting).
