  Nat.card {x : ℝ | abs (abs x - 1/2) = abs (abs x - 1/4)} = P2024AIMEI_12_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The set condition simplifies to the points where the distances | |x| - 1/2 | and | |x| - 1/4 | are equal, which occurs at x satisfying |x| = 1/4 or |x| = 1/2. These correspond to four points on the real line: ±1/4 and ±1/2. The total count is 4.
