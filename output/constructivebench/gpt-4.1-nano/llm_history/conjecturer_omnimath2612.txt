Given that the set consists of pairs of finite sets from Fin 10 whose union has exactly 3 elements, the answer is the number of such pairs. For each 3-element subset, there are 4 non-empty subset pairs that union to it, leading to an answer of 4 times the number of 3-element subsets.

Total number of 3-element subsets of a 10-element set: C(10,3) = 120.
Each subset yields 4 pairs, so total is 4 * 120 = 480.
