abbrev omnimath94_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath94 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ m n : ℕ, f (m + n) * f (m - n) = f (m^2)) ↔ f = omnimath94_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun _ => 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n * n
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a function f : ℕ → ℕ that satisfies the functional equation:
   ∀ m n : ℕ, f (m + n) * f (m - n) = f (m²)

2. The ground truth answer is the constant function f(n) = 1 for all n ∈ ℕ.

3. The proposed answer is the quadratic function f(n) = n².

Let's test the proposed answer:
Take m = 2, n = 1:
f(2+1)*f(2-1) = f(3)*f(1) = 9*1 = 9
f(2²) = f(4) = 16
9 ≠ 16, so the proposed answer doesn't satisfy the equation.

The ground truth answer works because:
f(m+n)*f(m-n) = 1*1 = 1
f(m²) = 1
So 1 = 1 holds for all m,n.
