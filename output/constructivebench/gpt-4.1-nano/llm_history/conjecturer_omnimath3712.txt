theorem omnimath3712 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ m n, Nat.gcd (f m) n + Nat.lcm m (f n) = Nat.gcd m (f n) + Nat.lcm (f m) n) ↔ f = omnimath3712_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Based on pattern and symmetry in the given equation, the function f should behave trivially, such as the identity function, to satisfy the condition for all m, n. The sum of gcd and lcm expressions suggests f might be constant or scaled linearly, but identity matches symmetry exactly.
