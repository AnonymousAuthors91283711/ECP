theorem P2010AMCB_10 (x : ℝ) : 
  ((List.sum (List.map (fun n => (n + 1 : ℝ)) (List.range 99))) + x) / 101 = 100 * x ↔ x = P2010AMCB_10_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern in enumerated answers involves the sum of integers 1 to 99, which is \( \frac{99 \times 100}{2} = 4950 \). Solving the equation \(\frac{4950 + x}{101} = 100x\), we find \(x = \frac{4950}{10001}\). This is a closed form expression, valid for all real \(x\).
