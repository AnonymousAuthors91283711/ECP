Given that exactly 7 values are assigned either 3.71 or 3.72, and their sum is 26:

Let x be the number of elements with value 3.72. Then the total sum:

(7 - x) * 3.71 + x * 3.72 = 26

Simplify:

(7 - x)*3.71 + 3.72x = 26

which reduces to:

7*3.71 - x*3.71 + 3.72x = 26

=> 7*3.71 + x*(3.72 - 3.71) = 26

=> 7*3.71 + x*0.01 = 26

Calculate:

7*3.71 = 25.97

Thus,

25.97 + 0.01x = 26

=> 0.01x = 0.03

=> x = 3

So, exactly 3 of the values are 3.72.
