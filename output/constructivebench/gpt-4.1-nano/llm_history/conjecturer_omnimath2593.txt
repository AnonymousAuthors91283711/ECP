The problem describes a function c : ℤ → Bool that is periodic with period 7, with additional constraints on the existence of a certain k. The constraints imply c is consistent with being 7-periodic, but must not admit simultaneous conditions relating c(k) and c(k+1), and c(2k). The only such solutions are constant functions, since non-constant solutions either violate periodicity or the specific constraints.

Given that, the total number of such functions with period dividing 7 is 2^7 = 128; but since the functions are constrained to satisfy the properties, and the only compliant are constant functions (either always true or always false), the total is 2.

Final answer:

<<<2>>>
