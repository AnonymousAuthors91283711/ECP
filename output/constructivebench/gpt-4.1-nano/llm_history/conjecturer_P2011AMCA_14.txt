theorem P2011AMCA_14 :
  let pairs := Finset.product (Finset.Icc 1 9) (Finset.Icc 1 9)
  let count := pairs.filter (fun (a, b) => b > a * a - b * 1)
  (count.card : ℚ) / (pairs.card : ℚ) = P2011AMCA_14_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The problem involves ratios of filtered pairs, and the filter predicate simplifies to b > a² - b, leading to b > a² / 2. For each a in 1..9, valid b are from a+1 to 9, provided b > a²/2, which covers all b > max(a, a²/2). Calculations reveal that the fraction stabilizes as a sum over a. The proportion simplifies to the sum over a, of (number of valid b)/9. Summing this ratio yields a closed-form value.
