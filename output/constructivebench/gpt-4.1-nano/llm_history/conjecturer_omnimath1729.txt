Given the recursive structure of a, with initial values involving √2 and 2, and the periodicity condition mod 2014, the minimal period p appears to be related to the properties of a sequence involving powers and products. The observation of the initial terms and the pattern suggests the sequence becomes periodic modulo 2014 at period 2014, driven by recurring factors in a's recursive formula. Thus, the least such p is 2014.
