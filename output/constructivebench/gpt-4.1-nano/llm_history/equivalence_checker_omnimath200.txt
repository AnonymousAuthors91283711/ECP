Ground Truth Answer: {(-1, -1), (8, -10), (9, -6), (9, -21)}
Proposed Answer: {(m, n) | ∃ a b : ℤ, m = a + b ∧ n = a^2 + b}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all pairs of non-zero integers (m,n) such that (m²+n)(m+n²) = (m-n)³.

2. The ground truth provides 4 specific solution pairs.

3. The proposed answer gives a parametric solution in terms of a and b.

Now let's check if the proposed answer matches the ground truth:

For (-1,-1):
Let a = -1, b = 0:
m = -1 + 0 = -1
n = 1 + 0 = 1 ≠ -1 → Doesn't work
Actually, no combination gives (-1,-1), so this pair is missing.

For (8,-10):
Let a = 2, b = 6:
m = 2 + 6 = 8
n = 4 + 6 = 10 ≠ -10 → Doesn't match

For (9,-6):
Let a = 3, b = 6:
m = 3 + 6 = 9
n = 9 + 6 = 15 ≠ -6 → Doesn't match

For (9,-21):
Let a = 3, b = 6:
Same issue as above.

The proposed parametric solution doesn't generate any of the ground truth pairs. Moreover, it seems to generate different solutions than what's required.
