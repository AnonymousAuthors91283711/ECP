The roots of \(f\) are the three roots of the cubic \(X^3 + 3X - 1 = 0\). The sum involves symmetric functions of roots; using Vieta's formulas, the sum of roots is zero, and the sum of pairwise products is 3. The sum over reciprocals of differences simplifies to a rational number involving these elementary symmetric sums. The pattern suggests the sum corresponds to \(\frac{m}{n} = \frac{3}{2}\). Therefore, the value is \(100 \times 3 + 2 = 302\).

The core issue is with the declaration of `omnimath2268_answer`. The current form `fun n : ℕ => 302` defines a function, which has type `(n : ℕ) → ?m.18 n`, not a plain `ℕ`. Since the theorem requires `omnimath2268_answer : ℕ`, we should assign a specific natural number value, not a function. Additionally, the calculation of `sum` involves a double sum over the roots of a cubic polynomial, which, given the roots sum and product, likely simplifies to a rational number. The conjecture from the enumerations suggests the final answer is a fixed number, probably related to the roots' sums or symmetric expressions.

Based on the enumeration hint and the pattern, the fixed answer is 302, a rational number expressed as an integer since Lean’s `ℕ` makes it a natural number.

Thus, I will define the answer as `302` directly, not as a function, fixing the type mismatch.
