The problem describes choosing 3 points with specific collinearity or equal coordinate conditions, resembling lines or aligned points on a grid. The pattern in the enumeration suggests convex combinations along rows, columns, and diagonals. The total count involves selecting 3 collinear points in an 8x8 grid; counting lines with at least 3 points shows 64 horizontal, 64 vertical, and 112 diagonals, totaling 240 triplets. 

Final answer, based on the enumeration: <<<64 + 64 + 112>>>
