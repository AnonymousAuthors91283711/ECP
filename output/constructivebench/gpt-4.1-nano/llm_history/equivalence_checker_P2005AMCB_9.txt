Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: 0.25
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to calculate the difference between the weighted mean and median of given scores with specific weights.

2. Calculation steps:
   - Weighted mean = (70*0.1) + (80*0.25) + (85*0.2) + (90*0.15) + (95*0.3)
   - = 7 + 20 + 17 + 13.5 + 28.5 = 86
   - Median is given as 85 (middle value of sorted scores)
   - Difference = 86 - 85 = 1

3. The ground truth answer is correct (1).

4. The proposed answer (0.25) is incorrect as it doesn't match the correct calculation.
