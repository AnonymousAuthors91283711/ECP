The pattern suggests looking for positive cubes divisible by 1000, but with the property that dividing n by 1000 yields a cube. Since 1000 = 10^3, and n = k^3, for n / 1000 = m^3, n must be divisible by 10^3, i.e., n = (10m)^3. Excluding n divisible by 10 (so m not divisible by 10), the general form is n = (10m)^3 with m ≠ 0, m not divisible by 10. Thus, the set is all cubes of multiples of 10 that are not divisible by 10 when divided by 10.
