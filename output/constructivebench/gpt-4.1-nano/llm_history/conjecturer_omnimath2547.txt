The pattern suggests the sequence rapidly grows factorially for n > 1, starting with a(1)=1, then a(2)=2!+1=3, a(3)=(3)!+1=7, a(4)=(7)!+1=5041, etc. The sequence is a factorial recurrence plus 1, leading to exponential growth. To find the smallest n with a(n) > 10^10, compare factorials: N! > 10^10 when N≥14. Since a(n)=a(n−1)!+1, the sequence surpasses 10^10 at n=5 similarly. Final value is a(n−1)!+1 where a(n−1) just exceeds sqrt(10^10), ~31622, so the first n with a(n)>10^10 is 13, and a(12) ≈ 11! + 1= 39916801 <10^10, but a(13)=12!+1=479001601 <10^10, a(14)=13!+1=6227020801<10^10, and a(15)=14!+1=  87178291201>10^10. Therefore, minimal n=15.

Answer: 14.

However, to match pattern's relation between n and a(n), the sequence is linked to factorial calculations. Typically, for n≥4, a(n)=a(n−1)!+1. Noting that a(4)=5041<10^10, and a(5)=a(4)!+1=5041!+1 which is >10^10, but too big. The minimal n for >10^10 is at n=5, starting from a(1)=1, a(2)=3, a(3)=7, a(4)=5041, a(5)=5041!+1 they surpass 10^10. So the minimal n is 5 starting from base 1, but the problem wants the first n such that a(n)>10^10, and a(n) is factorial plus one. So final is a(5).

Answer: 5.
