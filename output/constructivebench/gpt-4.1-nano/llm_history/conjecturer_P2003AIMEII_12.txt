theorem P2003AIMEII_12 :
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∃ (votes : Fin 27 → ℕ), 
    (∑ i, votes i = n) ∧ 
    ∀ i, (100 * votes i) / n < votes i - 1} 
  P2003AIMEII_12_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the critical threshold n where votes satisfy the inequality. The key inequality involves ratio comparisons, leading to a minimized n balancing the vote distribution. The pattern indicates n = 527 for the minimal value satisfying these conditions. 

<<<527>>>
