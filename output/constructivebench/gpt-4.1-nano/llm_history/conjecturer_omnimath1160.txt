The problem seeks the minimal size n of a set s such that every pair p, q with p + q ≤ 2016 can be decomposed into subset sums. The minimal size arises when considering the worst-case scenario requiring maximum disjoint subsets, suggesting a partition related to the maximum sum 2016. Since the maximum total sum for pairs is 2016, and the smallest positive set size satisfying the condition for all pairs is when n = 2, i.e., two elements allowing all partitions summing to ≤ 2016.
