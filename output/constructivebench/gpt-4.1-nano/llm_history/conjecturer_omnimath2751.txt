theorem omnimath2751 :
  Set.ncard {p : ℤ × ℤ | let (a, b) := p; 4 < a ∧ a < b ∧ b < 22 ∧ (4 + a + b + 22)/4 = 13} = omnimath2751_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The set's conditions imply 4 < a < b < 22 and the average (a + b + 26)/4 = 13; thus, a + b + 26 = 52. Simplify to a + b = 26, with 5 ≤ a ≤ 21, b = 26 - a, and b > a. This yields a from 5 to 13, corresponding to 11 possible pairs.  
Answer: <<<11>>>
