The pattern suggests counting the set size based on the divisibility conditions, ultimately leading to a combinatorial count factoring in the structure described. Based on the pattern, the answer likely simplifies to a product involving powers of 2 and polynomial factors corresponding to the domain size bounds.

The enumeration hints at a total of 2^{10} + 10*2^{9} = 1024 + 512*10 = 1024 + 5120 = 6144.

Answer expressed as a closed-form in Lean:

<<<(2^10) + 10 * 2^9>>>
