Ground Truth Answer: fun ⟨x, y⟩ => 15 - y / x
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℝ × ℝ => p.1 + p.2 - 12
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function z = f(x,y) where:
   - x ∈ [2,5]
   - y ∈ [10,20]
   - The maximum value of z is 13

2. Ground Truth Answer: z = 15 - y/x
   - To find maximum, we minimize y/x
   - y/x is minimized when x is max (5) and y is min (10)
   - So min(y/x) = 10/5 = 2
   - Thus max(z) = 15 - 2 = 13 (matches problem statement)

3. Proposed Answer: z = x + y - 12
   - To find maximum, we maximize x + y
   - x + y is max when x=5 and y=20
   - So max(z) = 5 + 20 - 12 = 13 (matches problem statement)
   - However, this gives different values than ground truth for other (x,y) pairs

While both functions achieve the maximum value of 13 at their respective extreme points, they are different functions that produce different results for most (x,y) pairs in the domain. The problem only specifies the maximum value, not the entire function behavior, so both answers satisfy the given condition.

The proposed answer satisfies the maximum value condition but is not equivalent to the ground truth function.
