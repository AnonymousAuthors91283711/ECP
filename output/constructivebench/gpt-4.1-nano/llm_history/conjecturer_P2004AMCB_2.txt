theorem P2004AMCB_2 : 
  IsGreatest {x : ℕ | ∃ (a b c d : ℕ), 
    ({a, b, c, d} : Set ℕ) = {0, 1, 2, 3} ∧ x = c * a^b - d} 
  P2004AMCB_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The set contains elements of the form c * a^b - d with {a, b, c, d} = {0, 1, 2, 3}. The maximum occurs when c=3, a=2, b=1 and d=0, giving 3 * 2^1 - 0 = 6.  
Final answer: <<<6>>>
