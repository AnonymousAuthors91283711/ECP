Given the cyclic conditions and divisibility patterns, the pattern suggests E, V, I, L are rotations where the sum or difference scaling relates to the divisibility constraints. The pattern's symmetry and divisibility imply the reverse number (with digits permuted) equals specific constant. The most consistent conjecture is that the 4-digit number formed by digits (E, V, I, L) is equal to 6174, which is a well-known constant in such digit puzzles.

Thus, the answer is a constant number, 6174.
