Given the polynomial p and roots a, b, c, sum of cubes of roots is related to coefficients via Newton's identities. For a cubic polynomial with roots a, b, c, the sum a^3 + b^3 + c^3 equals (a + b + c)^3 minus 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) plus 3abc, which simplifies to 3abc + (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca). Using coefficient relationships from p, the final answer simplifies to 333.

The main issues are the use of the phrase "Given the polynomial..." in an `abbrev`, which is invalid syntax because `abbrev` requires a Lean expression, not a descriptive text. Also, the entire description is misplaced; it should be condensed into a relevant mathematical formula expressing the sum of cubes in terms of coefficients, preferably a closed-form integer. 

From the polynomial \( p = X^3 + X^2 - 333X - 1001 \), by Vieta's formulas:

- \( a + b + c = -\text{coefficient of } X^2 = -1 \).

- \( ab + ac + bc = \text{coefficient of } X = -333 \).

- \( abc = -\text{constant term} = 1001 \).

Using the identity for sum of cubes:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc,
\]
substitute the values:

\[
= (-1)^3 - 3(-1)(-333) + 3(1001) = -1 - 999 + 3003 = 3003 - 1000 = 2003.
\]

Thus, the answer is the integer 2003. The fixed Lean expression is simply `2003`.
