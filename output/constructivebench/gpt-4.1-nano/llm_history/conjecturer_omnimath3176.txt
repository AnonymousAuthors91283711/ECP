open Real Polynomial

noncomputable abbrev omnimath3176_answer : Polynomial (Polynomial ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3176 (P : Polynomial (Polynomial ℤ)) :
  (∀ (a : ℝ), eval (eval P ⌊a⌋) ⌊2 * a⌋ = 0) ↔ P = omnimath3176_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Polynomial (Polynomial ℤ)
The condition evaluates to zero for all real a; this suggests P's coefficients must be trivially null for all evaluations. Based on pattern, the answer polynomial represents the zero polynomial at the polynomial coefficient level.
