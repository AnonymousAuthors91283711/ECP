The set \( S \) includes all positive divisors of 100000. To find the size of the set of products \( p = d_1 \times d_2 \) with \( d_1, d_2 \in S \) and \( d_1 \neq d_2 \), consider the total pairs and subtract the diagonal pairs where \( d_1 = d_2 \). The divisor count of 100000 is 49, so total pairs are \(49^2\), with 49 pairs where \( d_1 = d_2 \). To avoid double counting, count each product once for \( d_1 \neq d_2 \), giving \(\frac{49 \times 48}{2}\). Since each product corresponds to a pair \( (d_1, d_2) \) with \( d_1 < d_2 \):

<<<(49 * 48) / 2>>>
