  (∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 99, (n ^ 3 + 3 * n ^ 2 + 3 * n) = omnimath2417_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern of the sum \( \sum_{n=1}^N (n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n) \), which resembles the binomial expansion of \( (n+1)^3 \), the sum from 1 to 99 simplifies to \( 99^3 \). 

Answer:
<<<99 ^ 3>>>
