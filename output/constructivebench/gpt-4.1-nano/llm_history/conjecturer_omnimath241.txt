The pattern suggests the minimum n where four subsets of size 6 each, pairwise disjoint or with intersections constrained by the fourth non-zero intersection, can be arranged within an n-element universe. The total minimal size for 4 such subsets, with the given intersection restrictions, is 12, since 4*6=24 overlaps are prevented by disjointness or singleton intersections, conforming to combinatorial bounds. 

Thus, the closed-form answer, based on the enumeration pattern and constraints, simplifies to n = 12.
