The problem asks for the maximal size of a set s of points in ℝ×ℝ such that any 3 points contain a pair exactly 1 unit apart. This resembles a maximal finite set with pairwise distances ≥1, where adding a fourth point would violate the condition. Given classical geometric constraints, the maximum is achieved with points forming the vertices of a regular triangle and potentially others, but not exceeding four points under these conditions.

Thus, the greatest n satisfying the property is 4.
