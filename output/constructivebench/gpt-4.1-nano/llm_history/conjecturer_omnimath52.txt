Given the divisibility condition, the pair (a, n) where n divides (a+1)^n - a^n implies n divides (a+1)^n - a^n. This difference simplifies via binomial expansion, showing that n divides (a+1 - a) * S, where S is some sum involving binomial coefficients. For n to always divide the difference, n must divide 1, so n=1. 

Answer:
<<<{ (a,1) | a > 0 }>>>
