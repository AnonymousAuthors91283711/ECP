Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 1 / x
Proposed Answer: fun x => 1
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is a functional equation that must hold for all x,y > 0, with the constraint that f(x) > 0 for all x > 0.

2. The ground truth answer is f(x) = 1/x. Let's verify it:
   - Left side: x*(1/x²)*(1/(1/y)) + 1/(y*(1/x)) = (x/x²)*y + x/y = y/x + x/y
   - Right side: (1/(x*y))*(1/(1/x²) + 1/(1/y²)) = (1/(xy))*(x² + y²) = (x² + y²)/(xy) = x/y + y/x
   - Both sides match, so f(x) = 1/x is indeed a solution.

3. The proposed answer is f(x) = 1 (constant function). Let's test it:
   - Left side: x*1*1 + 1 = x + 1
   - Right side: 1*(1 + 1) = 2
   - These are not equal for arbitrary x > 0 (e.g., x=2 gives 3 vs 2)

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the functional equation, while the ground truth does. They are not equivalent.
