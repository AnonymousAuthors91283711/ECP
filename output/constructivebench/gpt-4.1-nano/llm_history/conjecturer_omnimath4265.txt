Given the pattern of the enumerated answers, the problem seems to connect the set of integers n for which a certain dynamic process involving iterated polynomial evaluations modulo n matches a ceiling function involving n and powers of 2. The set likely includes integers with specific divisibility or factorization properties. The pattern suggests the answer encompasses precisely those n that are powers of 2, since powers of two exhibit clean halving properties aligning with powers of 2 in the ceiling function.

Therefore, the closed-form answer is the set of powers of 2.
