The pattern suggests counting two-digit numbers between 10 and 99 with both digits prime, and the number itself prime. The only such numbers are two-digit numbers with prime digits where the entire number is prime. The prime digits are 2, 3, 5, 7. The number n = 10 * a + b, with a, b prime, and n prime, for a, b ∈ {2, 3, 5, 7}. Checking combinations, the prime numbers fulfilling these conditions are [23, 37, 53, 73]. Therefore, the answer count is 4.
