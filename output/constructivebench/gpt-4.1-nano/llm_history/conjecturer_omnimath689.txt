  {(a, b, c, d) : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ × ℕ | a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ c > 0 ∧ d > 0 ∧ 12 * a + 21 * b + 28 * c + 84 * d = 2024}.encard = omnimath689_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests focusing on the coefficients' linear combination summing to 2024 with positive integers. The smallest positive solution occurs when choosing the minimal positive values for three variables and solving for the fourth. Given the coefficients, a reasonable simplified expression emphasizes the sum of the scaled variables, leading to a minimal sum structure.

<<<(2024 - 12 * 1 - 21 * 1 - 28 * 1) / 84 + 3>>>
