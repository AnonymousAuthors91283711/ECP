    {abc | ∃ a b c : ℤ,
      1 < a ∧ a < b ∧ b < c ∧
      (a - 1) * (b - 1) * (c - 1) ∣ a * b * c - 1} = omnimath3891_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ × ℤ)
The condition (a - 1)(b - 1)(c - 1) divides a b c - 1 suggests a special structure where a - 1, b - 1, c - 1 are factors of the difference. Considering minimal solutions and the divisibility constraints, the pattern indicates (a, b, c) can be parametrized as (n + 1, n^2 + 1, n^3 + 1) for n > 1, satisfying the inequalities and divisibility (as shown in enumerated solutions). 

Final answer:

<<<{(a, b, c) | ∃ n : ℕ, n > 1 ∧ a = n + 1 ∧ b = n^2 + 1 ∧ c = n^3 + 1}>>>
