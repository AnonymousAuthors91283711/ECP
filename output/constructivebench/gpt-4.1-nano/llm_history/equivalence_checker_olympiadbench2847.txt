Ground Truth Answer: 7
Proposed Answer: 10
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n where:
   - n can be split into two positive integers b and r (b + r = n)
   - The expression b*r*(b + r - 2)/2 equals 25

2. Ground Truth Answer is 7:
   - Possible splits: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4)
   - Checking (3,4): 3*4*(3+4-2)/2 = 3*4*5/2 = 30 ≠ 25
   - Checking (2,5): 2*5*5/2 = 25 → This works
   - Therefore 7 is correct as it's the smallest n that satisfies the condition

3. Proposed Answer is 10:
   - Possible splits include (2,8), (3,7), (4,6), (5,5)
   - (5,5): 5*5*8/2 = 100 ≠ 25
   - (4,6): 4*6*8/2 = 96 ≠ 25
   - While 10 might have some splits that satisfy the equation, it's not the smallest such n

The proposed answer (10) is incorrect because while it might satisfy the condition, it's not the least such number (which is 7).
