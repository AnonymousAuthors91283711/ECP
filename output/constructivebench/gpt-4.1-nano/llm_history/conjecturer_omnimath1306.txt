theorem omnimath1306 : 
  ∃ (a b c : ℤ) (f : ℤ[X]), 
    f = X^4 + C a * X^2 + C b * X + C c ∧ 
    (2 : ℤ) ∈ f.roots ∧ (-3 : ℤ) ∈ f.roots ∧ (5 : ℤ) ∈ f.roots ∧ 
    a + b + c = omnimath1306_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℤ
Given roots 2, -3, 5, the polynomial is (X - 2)(X + 3)(X - 5) times some factor, leading to a cubic polynomial with specific coefficients. The sum of roots equals -a, which is - ( -2 + 3 + 5 ) = -6, and coefficient relations lead to identify a, b, c.  
Final answer: <<< -6 >>>
