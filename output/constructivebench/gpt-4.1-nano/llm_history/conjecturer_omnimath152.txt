    omnimath152_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Bool
The condition involves a set of distinct natural numbers with sums of squares and cubes forming perfect powers. Given the pattern and the constraints, the only feasible solution under these sum conditions is when the set contains a single element, with x0 = 0, leading to y = 0 and z = 0. 

Final answer:
<<<true>>>

This indicates that the only realization satisfying the conditions is the trivial case.
