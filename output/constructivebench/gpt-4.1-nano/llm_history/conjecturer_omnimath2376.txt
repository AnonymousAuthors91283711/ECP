theorem omnimath2376 : 
  IsLeast {t : ℝ | ∃ (z : ℂ), 0 ≤ z.re ∧ 0 ≤ z.im ∧ Complex.abs (z^2 + 2) ≤ Complex.abs z ∧ t = z.im / z.re} omnimath2376_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the bounds and the definition, the minimal value of t = z.im / z.re occurs when z is on the circle |z^2 + 2| ≤ |z|, with z in the first quadrant, approaching the asymptote where z.im / z.re is minimized. Analyzing the inequality suggests the ratio approaches -√2 as z approaches the boundary where z^2 + 2 hits |z|, but constrained to the first quadrant, the minimal ratio is -1.
