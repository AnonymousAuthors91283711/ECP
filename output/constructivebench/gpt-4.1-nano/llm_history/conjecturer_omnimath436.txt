Given the set {(x, y) | x^2 + 2 y^2 < 25}, we find integer solutions where x^2 + 2 y^2 < 25. For each y, x satisfies |x| < √(25 - 2 y^2). Valid y include y ∈ { -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 }, with corresponding x constrained accordingly. Counting all solutions yields total solutions 45. Thus, the answer is 45.
