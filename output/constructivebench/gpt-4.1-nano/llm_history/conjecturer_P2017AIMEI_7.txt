abbrev P2017AIMEI_7_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2017AIMEI_7 : 
  (∑ a in range 7, ∑ b in range (7 - a), Nat.choose 6 a * Nat.choose 6 b * Nat.choose 6 (a + b)) % 1000 = P2017AIMEI_7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sums involve binomial coefficients with symmetrical and combinatorial patterns; the inner sum resembles convolutions of binomial coefficients. Recognizing the sum as a binomial identity, and based on enumerated patterns, the final answer constant emerges as 472. 

<<<472>>>
