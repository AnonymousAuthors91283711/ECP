Given hf: \(f(x) = 2x + 1\), and \(g(f(x)) = 4x^2 + 1\), deduce \(g\) as a function of \(f\). Since \(g\) depends on \(f\) through the quadratic expression in \(x\), substitute \(x = \frac{f(x) - 1}{2}\) into \(4x^2 + 1\) expressing \(g(y)\) in terms of \(y\):

\[
g(y) = y^2 - y + 1
\]

as \(y = f(x)\).
