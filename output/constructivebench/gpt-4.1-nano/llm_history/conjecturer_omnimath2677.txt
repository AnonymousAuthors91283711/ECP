abbrev omnimath2677_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath2677 : (3 + 6) / (3 * 6) = omnimath2677_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Given the enumerated answers and the expression \(\frac{3 + 6}{3 \times 6} = \frac{9}{18} = \frac{1}{2}\), the pattern suggests the answer is the simplified form of the fraction. 

Therefore, the final answer is a simplified fraction \(\frac{1}{2}\).
