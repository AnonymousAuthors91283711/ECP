Ground Truth Answer: 11 / 2^20
Proposed Answer: (1/2)^15 * ((1 - (1/2)^5) / (1 - 1/2))
Let me analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

The ground truth answer is 11/2^20.

The proposed answer is (1/2)^15 * ((1 - (1/2)^5) / (1 - 1/2)).

Let's simplify the proposed answer:
1. The denominator (1 - 1/2) = 1/2
2. The numerator (1 - (1/2)^5) = 1 - 1/32 = 31/32
3. So the fraction becomes (31/32)/(1/2) = 31/16
4. Multiply by (1/2)^15: (31/16)*(1/2)^15 = 31/2^19

Now compare with ground truth:
11/2^20 vs 31/2^19 = 62/2^20

These are clearly not equal (11 ≠ 62). Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
