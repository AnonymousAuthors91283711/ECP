The key is to satisfy the equation (V + U + Q + A + R)^2 / (V - U - Q + A + R) = V^{U^{Q^{A^{R}}}} with discrete values in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The rapid growth of the exponentiation suggests the case where the division's denominator equals 1, i.e., V - U - Q + A + R = 1. Given V, U, Q, A, R are restricted to {1,2,3,4,5}, the solutions are tuples where the sum V + U + Q + A + R is small enough, and the power V^{U^{Q^{A^{R}}}} is manageable, matching the square numerator. The typical pattern corresponds to 5-tuple permutations with the sum close to 9, where the exponents are appropriately chosen. 

The set of solutions is precisely where V = 1 (to simplify the exponentiation), with the remaining elements U, Q, A, R in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, forming all permutations with sum 10 (or small sum). Based on enumeration, the main pattern points to (1,2,3,4,5) and its permutations.

Final answer:
