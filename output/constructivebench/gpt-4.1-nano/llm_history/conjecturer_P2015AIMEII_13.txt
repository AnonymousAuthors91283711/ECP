theorem P2015AIMEII_13 : 
  let a (n : ℕ) := ∑ k in Finset.range n, sin (k + 1)
  Finset.card {k ∈ Finset.range (P2015AIMEII_13_answer + 1) | a k < 0} = 100 ∧
  ∀ m < P2015AIMEII_13_answer, Finset.card {k ∈ Finset.range (m + 1) | a k < 0} < 100 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern indicates the largest n where the sum of sines is still negative before reaching a non-negative value. Since sum of sine functions oscillates, and given the enumeration points to 200, the maximum k with sum < 0 is likely 200.
