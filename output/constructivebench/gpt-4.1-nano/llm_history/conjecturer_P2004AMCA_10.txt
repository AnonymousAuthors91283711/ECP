Given the symmetry in the sum and the central term alignment, the sum of (k + i) from i=0 to 48 is centered at i=24. Summing from i=0 to 48, the terms are symmetric around the middle: (k+24) multiplied by 49, plus the sum of the integers around 24. The sum of i from 0 to 48 is (48*49)/2 = 1176, so the total sum is 49 * (k + 24) + 1176. Set this equal to 7^5 = 16807, solve for k + 24: k + 24 = (16807 - 1176)/49 = 15631/49, which simplifies to 319. Juin 

Final answer: <<<319>>>
