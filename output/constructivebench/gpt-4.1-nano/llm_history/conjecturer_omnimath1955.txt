The pattern suggests the answer is the minimal natural number satisfying the given inequalities involving the fourth root of n. The inequalities describe n where the fractional part of the fourth root of n is in (0, 1/2015). The smallest such n occurs at the smallest x > 0 with fractional part in (0, 1/2015), i.e., at n = ⎣x⁴⎦ + 1 where fractional part of x is just over 0, approaching 1/2015. For minimal n, fractional part ≈ 1/2015, leading n ≈ (k + 1/2015)⁴ for k an integer ≥ 0. For the minimal case, k=0, so:

n ≈ (1/2015)⁴.

So, the minimal such n is approximately (1/2015)⁴, and since n must be an integer, the first integer exceeding (1/2015)⁴ is the ceiling:

n = ⌊( (k + fractional) )⁴⌋ + 1 with fractional in (0, 1/2015).

The minimal n satisfying the fractional part condition is then:

<<= 1 + (⌊ (1 / 2015) ^ 4 ⌋)>>.

But since fractional part just over 0, n = largest integer less than or equal to (some x)^4 with fractional part approaching 0, so the minimal n satisfying the inequalities is:

<<<( (1 / 2015) ^ 4) >>>

but to match the exact nature of the problem and the answer pattern, the answer is:

<<<(1 + (⌊(1 / 2015) ^ 4⌋))>>>
