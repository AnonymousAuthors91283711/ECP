The pattern suggests the minimal n where the sequence reaches 2014 by applying the operations starting from some positive integer. Since the sequence can grow rapidly via a doubling plus one or decrease via division, the minimal n occurs when the sequence first attains 2014. The enumeration indicates the minimal n is 11, considering the possible steps backward and forward.
