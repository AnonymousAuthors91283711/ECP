The problem asks for the number of integers \(m\) between 1 and 49 inclusive that divide \(n^{n+1} + 1\) for some \(n\). Since divisibility is typically constrained by parity, and examining small cases shows divisibility primarily when \(m \) divides 2, the plausible general answer is number of such \(m\). The only \(m \le 49\) dividing \(n^{n+1}+1\) arises when \(m=1\) or 2, but 1 always divides anything; for 2, divisibility occurs when \(n\) is odd. The total count is 2 (for m=1 and m=2).
