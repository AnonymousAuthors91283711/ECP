  ∃ (l : List ℕ), l.Nodup ∧ l ⊆ [2, 3, 4, 6] ∧ l.length = 3 ∧ l.sum = 11 ∧ l.prod = omnimath2745_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the list constraints, the subset sums to 11 with length 3 and elements from {2, 3, 4, 6}. Checking combinations, only (2, 3, 6) satisfy sum=11 and length=3. The product is 2 * 3 * 6 = 36.
