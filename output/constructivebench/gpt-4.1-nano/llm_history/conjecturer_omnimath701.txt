The sum reduces to considering j in {1, 2, 3}, and n=3 only, as the inner sum is non-zero only at n=3. For each j, jerry_prob j = 1/3, and neil_prob j 3 = (1/3)* (2/3)^(3-j). The total is sum over j of (1/3) * (1/3) * (2/3)^(3-j). Sum: (1/9) * [(2/3)^2 + (2/3)^1 + (2/3)^0] = (1/9) * [4/9 + 2/3 + 1] = (1/9) * [(4/9) + (6/9) + (9/9)] = (1/9) * (19/9) = 19/81.
