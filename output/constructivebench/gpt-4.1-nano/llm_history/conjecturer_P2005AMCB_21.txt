The pattern suggests the exponent of 7 dividing n relates to the ratio of the divisor counts, which are 60 and 80. Since divisors of n and 7*n are connected, and 7 multiplies n increasing the divisor count, the structure hints at the exponent. The ratio (80/60)=4/3 suggests the exponent of 7 in n is 2, as 7^2 divides n.
