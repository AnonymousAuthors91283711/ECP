  Set.ncard {p : ℤ × ℤ | (p.1 ^ 2 + p.2 ^ 2 < 2019) ∧ (p.1 ^ 2 + min p.1 p.2 = p.2 ^ 2 + max p.1 p.2)} = omnimath2210_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the constraints, the key is to analyze the set conditions: points with \( p.1^2 + p.2^2 < 2019 \), and an equality involving squares and min/max. The square sum restricts points to a circle of radius \(\sqrt{2019}\), and the equality simplifies to a relation holding only when \( p.1 = p.2 \). Therefore, the set is the count of all points on the line \( p.1 = p.2 \) inside the circle x^2 + y^2 < 2019.

Number of integer points on the line \( y = x \) satisfying \( 2x^2 < 2019 \):

The largest integer \( x \) with \( 2x^2 < 2019 \) is \( x \leq \lfloor \sqrt{1009.5} \rfloor = 31 \).

Counting symmetric points: from \(-31\) to 31, total of \( 2 \times 31 + 1 = 63 \).
