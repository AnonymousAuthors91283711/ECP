Given the symmetry and the nature of the sign function, the variables satisfy identical conditions. The set reduces to points where t.2.1 + t.2.2 determines the sign, leading to discrete solutions. The total count is 4, corresponding to the possible sign combinations. 

Hence, the answer is 4.

<<<4>>>
