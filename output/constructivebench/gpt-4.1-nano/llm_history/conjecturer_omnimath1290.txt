The sum over permutations involving cycle types relates to the sum of cycle counts. Since total permutations are \(7!\), and sum of cycles over all permutations in \(S_7\) equals \(7 \times 6!\), the total sum of \( \text{number of cycles} \) for all permutations is \(7! \times 1\). The total sum in question adjusts for the number of permutations and their cycle types, resulting in \(7! \times (1 - \frac{1}{7}) = 6 \times 6!\).

Hence, the result simplifies to \(6 \times 6!\).

<<<6 * 720>>>
