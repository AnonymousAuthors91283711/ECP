Ground Truth Answer: 78
Proposed Answer: 32
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a geometric progression where b = a*r and c = a*r², with the constraints:
   - a + b + c = 114
   - a * b * c = 46656
   - We need to find a + c

2. The ground truth answer is 78, while the proposed answer is 32.

3. Let's verify the ground truth:
   - If a + c = 78, then b = 114 - 78 = 36
   - From b = a*r and c = a*r² = 78 - a
   - We can solve to find a = 24, r = 1.5, c = 54
   - Check product: 24 * 36 * 54 = 46656 ✓
   - Thus 24 + 54 = 78 is correct

4. The proposed answer 32 would imply:
   - b = 114 - 32 = 82
   - Trying to solve would lead to non-integer solutions that don't satisfy the product condition

<<<False>>>
