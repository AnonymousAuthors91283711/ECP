  (∑ k in Finset.Icc 0 100, (Int.floor ((2 ^ 100 : ℝ) / (2 ^ 50 + 2 ^ k))) = omnimath892_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern, the sum involves terms with powers of 2 and floor divisions. The pattern suggests the sum simplifies symmetrical over k in [0..100], reflecting powers of 2 scaled and partitioned. The sum of these terms equates to a simple function of 2^100, possibly halved or involving a quadratic term. Given the pattern and symmetry, the final answer is likely \(2^{99}\).
