The pattern in the enumerated answers suggests that the set consists of polynomials of degree 1, specifically those with a particular form involving symmetric coefficients. To satisfy the functional equation, P likely has the form aX + b with constraints on a and b. The form that matches the pattern (and the symmetry between z and 1/z) points to the set of polynomials with a linear dominant term and specific constant terms. Based on the pattern, the most plausible closed-form set is: polynomials of the form aX + 1 with a ≠ 0, capturing the essential symmetry.
