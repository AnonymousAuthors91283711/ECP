Ground Truth Answer: 1024
Proposed Answer: 256
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of triples (words) in α × α × α where α has cardinality 16, with the constraint that for any two words w₁ and w₂, the first component of w₁ must differ from the third component of w₂.

2. The ground truth answer is 1024, which makes sense because:
   - We can fix the middle component of each triple to any value (16 choices)
   - For each fixed middle component, the first and third components can be chosen independently (16 × 16 = 256 choices per middle component)
   - The constraint only relates first components to third components of other triples, so we can maximize by choosing all possible triples where the first and third components are independent (16 × 16 × 16 = 4096) and then applying the constraint reduces this to 1024

3. The proposed answer is 256, which would correspond to just considering the number of possible pairs (first and third components) without considering the middle component optimization.

The proposed answer is too small because it doesn't account for the fact that we can vary the middle component to get more valid triples while still satisfying the constraint.
