    p + q + r + s = P2013AIMEII_15_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The cosine expression is of form (p + q * sqrt r) / s, with r squarefree and not a perfect square. Given the typical pattern, and considering the sum p+q+r+s, the plausible minimal sum satisfying the conditions is 7, corresponding to a special angle (e.g., 30°, 45°, etc) with r=2, p=1, q=1, s=2. 

Final answer:
<<<7>>>
