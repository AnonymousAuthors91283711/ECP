The problem involves the set of pairs (m, n) such that the infinite set of solutions for a particular equation exists. For m, n ≥ 3, the pattern in the enumerated answers suggests that the solutions occur when m divides n or n divides m, to allow the expression (a^m + a - 1) to be factored accordingly. This typical divisibility condition often leads to an infinite solution set.

Considering the structure, the final set likely encompasses all pairs where m divides n or n divides m, thus:

<<<{(m, n) | m ∣ n ∨ n ∣ m}>>>
