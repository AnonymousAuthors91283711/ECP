The polynomial \(f(x) = x^2 + 6x + 6\) iterated 6 times equals zero at the greatest initial \(x\). Recognizing the quadratic's root, the iterated "fixed point" approach points to the fixed point's value: \(x = -3 + \sqrt{3}\). Since iteration past the fixed point converges, the greatest \(x\) satisfying the iteration is \(x = -3 + \sqrt{3}\).

<<<-3 + sqrt 3>>>
