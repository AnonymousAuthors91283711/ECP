The problem counts configurations with exactly 2 visible faces among 27 cube positions, where only outermost positions (x,y,z ∈ {0,2}) are considered visible, and exactly 4 such faces are visible in total. The pattern indicates selecting 2 positions among the outer surface with 4 visible faces.

Conjecture: The answer is \(\binom{18}{2}\) since there are 18 outer surface points with 3 faces each, and choosing 2 points yields 4 visible faces.
