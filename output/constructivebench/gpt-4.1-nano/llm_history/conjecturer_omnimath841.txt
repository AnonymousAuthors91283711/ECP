The pattern suggests that f a b stabilizes at a certain value based on repeated halving or doubling steps, considering the conditions, leading toward the value that simplifies conserved parts. Since the only constant in the sequence under the rules is related to the power of 3, the natural guess is that the answer scales with a power of 3. Given the pattern in enumerations, the answer converges toward a multiple of 3 powers. The simplest closed form fitting the pattern is:

<<<(3 ^ 2021) - 1>>>
