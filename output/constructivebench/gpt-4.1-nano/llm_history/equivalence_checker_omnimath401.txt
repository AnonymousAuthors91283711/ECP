theorem omnimath401 (p : ℕ) :
  (∃ x y : ℤ, p = x^2 + 3 * y^2) ↔ omnimath401_answer p := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun p => Nat.Prime p ∧ (p = 3 ∨ p % 3 = 1)
Proposed Answer: fun p => p % 3 = 0 ∨ p % 4 = 1 ∨ p % 4 = 0
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is about representing natural numbers p in the form x² + 3y² where x,y are integers. The ground truth answer states that this is possible exactly when p is prime and either equals 3 or is congruent to 1 modulo 3.

The proposed answer suggests completely different conditions: p is divisible by 3, or congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4.

Key differences:
1. The ground truth requires primality, while the proposed answer doesn't
2. The ground truth works modulo 3, while the proposed answer mixes modulo 3 and modulo 4 conditions
3. The proposed answer would accept many composite numbers (like 4, 6, 8, 9, etc.) that can't be represented as x² + 3y² for prime p

Counterexamples:
- p=4: Proposed answer accepts it (4%4=0), but 4 can't be written as x²+3y² (try x=0,1,2)
- p=7: Ground truth accepts it (prime and 7%3=1), but proposed answer rejects it (7%3=1 but not in their conditions)

The answers are fundamentally different in their approach and results.
