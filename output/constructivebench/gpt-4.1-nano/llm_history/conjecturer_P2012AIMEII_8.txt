The problem involves roots of unity and their algebraic relations. Given the symmetry and the form of the relation, the minimal value of the norm squared of the product z' * w' occurs when z' and w' are specific roots satisfying the relation, likely when z' and w' are conjugate roots. The pattern suggests that the minimal value relates to the squared magnitude of their sum and difference. Computing this yields a constant value based on the magnitudes.
