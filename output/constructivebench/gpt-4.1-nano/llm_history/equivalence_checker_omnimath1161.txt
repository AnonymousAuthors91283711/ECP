Ground Truth Answer: fun t p => 1 - (1/2) ^ t
Proposed Answer: fun t p => (1 - p) * exp (-t) * (1 - (p * exp (-t)))⁻¹
Let me analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

The problem involves an infinite series sum with terms involving exponentials, factorials, and powers. The ground truth answer is a simple expression `1 - (1/2)^t`, while the proposed answer is more complex involving exponentials and a geometric series-like term.

Key observations:
1. The ground truth answer doesn't depend on p, while the proposed answer does
2. According to the theorem statement, p is constrained to be log(2)
3. The ground truth answer can be rewritten using p=log(2) as `1 - exp(-t*log(2)) = 1 - exp(log(2^(-t))) = 1 - 2^(-t) = 1 - (1/2)^t`
4. The proposed answer with p=log(2) becomes: `(1 - log(2)) * exp(-t) * (1 - (log(2) * exp(-t)))⁻¹` which doesn't simplify to the ground truth

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It maintains a dependency on p that shouldn't exist in the final simplified form
- Even when substituting p=log(2), it doesn't match the ground truth
- The structure suggests it might be attempting to model a geometric series, but fails to capture the correct behavior of the original series
