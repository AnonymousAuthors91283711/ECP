theorem olympiadbench3084 :
  ∃ (f : ℤ → ℕ), (∀ (n : ℤ), f n = f (n - 1) * f (n - 2)) ∧
  (∀ (n : ℤ), 0 < n → 0 < f n) ∧
  f 1 = f 2 / 512 ∧ (1 / f 1 : ℚ) = 2 * f 2 ∧
  f (f 4) = olympiadbench3084_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the recursive relation \(f(n) = f(n-1) \times f(n-2)\), the positive initial conditions, and the given equalities, the sequence suggests that \(f(1)\) and \(f(2)\) are powers of 2, with \(f(2) = 4096\) and \(f(1)=8\) satisfying the conditions. Then, \(f(4) = f(3) \times f(2)\), where \(f(3) = f(2) \times f(1) = 4096 \times 8 = 32768\), and hence \(f(4) = 32768 \times 4096 = 134217728\). The answer is then:

<<<134217728>>>
