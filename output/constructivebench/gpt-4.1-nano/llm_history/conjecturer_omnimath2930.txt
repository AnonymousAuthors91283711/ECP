abbrev omnimath2930_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2930 :
  (1 + (3 * 5)) / 2 = omnimath2930_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the sum (1 + 3*5)/2 = (1 + 15)/2 = 16/2 = 8, the general form simplifies to (1 + 3*5)/2 = 8. The enumerated answer indicates a fixed value.

<<<8>>>

This is the constant value for the given expression, matching the pattern in the enumerated answers.
