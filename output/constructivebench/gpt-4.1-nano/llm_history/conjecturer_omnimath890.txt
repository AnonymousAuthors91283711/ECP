The pattern suggests the maximum value occurs when \(a, b, c\) are minimal positive integers satisfying the equation. Since gcds are positive and minimal at 1, and the sum involves gcds plus 120, the maximum is achieved when gcds are at their minimum, i.e., 1 each, giving \(a + b + c = 123\). To maximize \(a\), set \(b = c = 1\), then \(a + 2 = 4 + 120\), yielding \(a = 120\). 

<<<120>>>
