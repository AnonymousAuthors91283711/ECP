abbrev P2003AMCA_1_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem P2003AMCA_1 (n : ℕ) :
  (∑ k in Finset.range n, 2*(k+1)) - (∑ k in Finset.range n, 2*k + 1) = P2003AMCA_1_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find a function P2003AMCA_1_answer that satisfies the given equation involving two sums.

2. The first sum ∑(2*(k+1)) from k=0 to n-1 can be simplified to 2∑(k+1) = 2[n(n+1)/2] = n(n+1)

3. The second sum ∑(2k+1) from k=0 to n-1 can be split into 2∑k + ∑1 = 2[(n-1)n/2] + n = n(n-1) + n = n²

4. The difference between the sums is n(n+1) - n² = n² + n - n² = n

5. Therefore, the correct answer should indeed be the identity function fun n => n

6. The proposed answer matches exactly with the ground truth answer, both being the identity function.
