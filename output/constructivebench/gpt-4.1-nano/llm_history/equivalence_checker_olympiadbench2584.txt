Ground Truth Answer: sqrt 6
Proposed Answer: (sqrt 2) / (sqrt 3)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is a logarithmic equation with constraints on x (2x > 0, 3x > 0, etc.)
2. The ground truth answer is √6
3. The proposed answer is √2/√3 which simplifies to √(2/3) = √6/3

Now let's compare the answers:
- √6 ≈ 2.449
- √2/√3 ≈ 0.816

These are clearly different values. The proposed answer is actually the reciprocal of the square root of the ground truth answer (since 1/√6 = √6/6 ≈ 0.408, which is still different from the proposed answer).

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
