The condition `(d 0 ≠ 0) ∧ (∏ i, d i = 180)` with `d 0` in Fin 10 and others in Fin 10, and the product equal to 180. To satisfy the product, the non-zero values are divisors of 180, with `d 0 ≠ 0`. Since `d 0 ≠ 0`, `d 0` can be any divisor of 180 except zero, and the other four `d i` (i=1..4) can multiply to 180, with `d 0` included among their divisors. For each fixed `d 0` dividing 180 and nonzero, remaining four values multiply to 180 / d 0, each in Fin 10. Counting all such arrangements yields total combinations. 

Answer: 
<<<180 * 4^4>>>
