    m > n ∧ n > 1 ∧ 
    (∀ i : Fin (n - 1), ∑ j, x j ^ (i.val + 1) = 1) ∧

  omnimath1515_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests \(m\) and \(n\) relate through specific powers, with sums equaling 1, 2, and 4, hinting at roots of unity. For minimal \(k = m + n\) with constraints \(m > n > 1\), choosing minimal \(n\) beyond 1 (\(n=2\)) and minimal \(m > n\) (\(m=3\)) yields \(k=5\).  
Final answer: <<<5>>>
