Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 16
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the number of distinct integer values k such that the quadratic polynomial X² + kX + 36 has two distinct integer roots r₁ and r₂.

2. For a quadratic X² + kX + 36 to have integer roots r₁ and r₂:
   - r₁ + r₂ = -k
   - r₁ * r₂ = 36

3. We need to find all pairs of distinct integers (r₁, r₂) whose product is 36, then count the distinct values of k = -(r₁ + r₂).

4. Factor pairs of 36 (considering both positive and negative factors):
   (1,36), (-1,-36), (2,18), (-2,-18), (3,12), (-3,-12), (4,9), (-4,-9), (6,6), (-6,-6)
   (and their reverses, but since addition is commutative, we don't need to count both)

5. Excluding the identical pairs (6,6) and (-6,-6), we have 8 distinct pairs.

6. For each pair, we get a unique k value:
   -(1+36) = -37
   -(-1-36) = 37
   -(2+18) = -20
   -(-2-18) = 20
   -(3+12) = -15
   -(-3-12) = 15
   -(4+9) = -13
   -(-4-9) = 13

7. This gives exactly 8 distinct k values, matching the ground truth answer.

The proposed answer of 16 is incorrect because it likely counts both (a,b) and (b,a) as separate cases, but they produce the same k value.
