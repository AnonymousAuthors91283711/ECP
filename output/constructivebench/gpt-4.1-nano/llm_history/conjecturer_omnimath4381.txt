The key insights from hf involve the fractional parts being around 0.5, affecting f applied to scaled rationals. The condition on the sum suggests that a, b, c relate proportionally through their fractional parts, leading to a consistent pattern.

Made conjecture that all solutions satisfy a_c + b_c = 1, where a_c, b_c are fractional parts of a, b, respectively.

Thus, the final set includes triples with sum of fractional parts equal to 1.

The core of the conjectured answer appears to be the case where the fractional parts of a, b, c sum to 1, especially focusing on the fractional parts being in [0,1) and their sum equalling 1. The complicated check involving (a - (a - ⌊a⌋)) essentially reduces to the fractional part of a, which is a - ⌊a⌋. The main issue in the current Lean code is the mismatched parentheses and the ambiguous use of inequalities involving fractional parts.

To correct the syntax and match the pattern observed in enumerated answers, I will simplify to the set of triples where the fractional parts sum to 1. Since the fractional part of any rational a is a - ⌊a⌋, we focus on the property: frac(a) + frac(b) + frac(c) = 1, where 0 ≤ frac(x) < 1 for x in ℚ.

This aligns with the potential answer hinted at and allows a concise open set description.

**Final answer:**

<<<{ (a, b, c) : ℚ × ℚ × ℚ | 0 ≤ a - ⌊a⌋ ∧ 0 ≤ b - ⌊b⌋ ∧ 0 ≤ c - ⌊c⌋ ∧ (a - ⌊a⌋) + (b - ⌊b⌋) + (c - ⌊c⌋) = 1 }>>>

**Explanation:**
This set contains all triples of rationals whose fractional parts (a - ⌊a⌋, b - ⌊b⌋, c - ⌊c⌋) are in [0,1), and their sum equals 1, matching typical partition of the unit interval and aligning with the structure suggested by the enumerated solutions. This form is explicit, closed under rational limits, and matches the pattern consistent with the problem statement.
