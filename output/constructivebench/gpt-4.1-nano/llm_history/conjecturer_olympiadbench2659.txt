theorem olympiadbench2659 : 
  (10^(9^2 - 9))^(1/9)^(1/2)^(1/2) = olympiadbench2659_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The expression simplifies as a nested radical involving powers of 10 and exponents involving 9, ultimately reducing to a real number proportional to 10 raised to a fractional exponent. Based on pattern recognition and exponent simplification, the final answer is 10^{(9^2 - 9)/(9 * 2 * 2)} = 10^{72/36} = 10^{2} = 100. Hence, the answer simplifies to 100.
