abbrev omnimath468_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath468 (x : ℝ) :
    x^3 - 8 = 16 * (x + 1)^((1:ℝ)/3) ↔ x ∈ omnimath468_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {-2} ∪ {1 + sqrt 5, 1 - sqrt 5}
Proposed Answer: {t : ℝ | t^3 = 8 + 16 * (t + 1)^(1/3)}

The proposed answer is a correct characterization of the solution set, but it's not in the simplified form given by the ground truth. The ground truth explicitly lists the solutions (-2, 1+√5, 1-√5), while the proposed answer gives an implicit definition. Both represent the same solution set, but the forms are different. The proposed answer is mathematically equivalent but not in the preferred simplified form.
