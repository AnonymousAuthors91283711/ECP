abbrev P2013AMCA_5_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2013AMCA_5 : 
  let total := 105 + 125 + 175
  let share := total / 3
  let t := share - 105
  let d := share - 125
  t - d = P2013AMCA_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The total sum is 105 +125 +175=405; share=135; t=share-105=30; d=share-125=10; t-d=20.  
Final answer: <<<20>>>.
