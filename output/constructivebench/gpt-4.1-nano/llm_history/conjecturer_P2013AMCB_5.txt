The errors in your current answer stem from including a descriptive comment directly within the definition, which is not valid syntax in Lean. To fix this, I shall define `P2013AMCB_5_answer` as the simplified rational number corresponding to the calculation. The result simplifies as:

\[
\frac{33 \times 11 + 55 \times 33}{33 + 55} = \frac{2178}{88} = \frac{109}{4}
\]

Since Lean prefers exact rational literals for rational numbers, I will express this as `109 / 4`. This guarantees a correct, simplified closed-form answer of type ℝ.

Conjugating this reasoning, I will write the final answer in Lean as:

```lean
<<< 109 / 4 >>
```

**Explanation:** This value is the simplified rational form of the original weighted average, which aligns with the enumerated answers and the problem's expectations for a closed-form decimal.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The main issue with the current proposal is that Lean does not recognize the delimiters <<< and >>>. These are meant to enclose the final answer, but cannot be used directly in Lean code. Instead, the answer should be written as the actual term, i.e., in this case, a rational number expressed as a real number.

The problem computes a weighted average: (33*11 + 55*33) / (33 + 55). Calculating numerator: 33*11 + 55*33 = 363 + 1815 = 2178. Denominator is 33 + 55 = 88. The exact division is 2178/88, which reduces to 109/4 (since 2178/4 = 544.5). Therefore, the simplified answer in Lean should be 109/4 : ℝ, written directly without delimiters. 

Since the problem expects an answer in ℝ, and 109/4 is a rational, we use `Rat.toReal (109/4)` or directly write `109/4` which Lean interprets as a rational number in ℝ. 

Thus, the corrected code is:

abbrev P2013AMCB_5_answer : ℝ := 109 / 4

and the theorem can be stated with this as the answer.

Final answer:

<<<abbrev P2013AMCB_5_answer : ℝ := 109 / 4>>>

This provides a precise, closed-form answer in Lean, matching the expected mathematical value.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The current proposed answer `and` is a boolean logical operator, which does not match the expected type ℝ (real number). Based on the problem statement, the calculation `(33 * 11 + 55 * 33) / (33 + 55)` is a weighted average, which simplifies to `(363 + 1815) / 88`. Let's verify this explicitly:

Compute numerator: `33*11 + 55*33 = 363 + 1815 = 2178`  
Compute denominator: `33 + 55 = 88`  
Result: `2178 / 88 = 24.75` (which is `99/4`) in fractional form.

Therefore, a suitable closed-form answer is `99/4` expressed as a real number in Lean.

The general pattern seems to be straightforward calculation:  
The exact result of `(33*11 + 55*33)/(33 + 55)` simplifies to a fraction `99/4`. Expressed as a real number in Lean, this would be `(99 : ℝ) / 4`.

Between options for precise representation, using `99/4` directly as a rational literal or explicitly as `99 / 4` is fine. Since `ℝ` can be defined via rationals, the best fit is `↑(99/4)` or simply `(99 : ℝ) / 4`.

Therefore, the corrected answer is:

`<<<(99 : ℝ) / 4>>>`

This is a concrete, closed-form real number matching the computation, avoiding type mismatch errors.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

theorem P2013AMCB_5 :
    (33 * 11 + 55 * 33) / (33 + 55) = P2013AMCB_5_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: (99 : ℝ) / 4. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 7, which is at "P2013AMCB_5_answer :" in "abbrev P2013AMCB_5_answer : ℝ := (99 : ℝ) / 4", there is an error: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instDivInvMonoid', and it does not have executable code.
. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The error message indicates that the definition involving division in Lean's `ℝ` (real numbers) requires marking as `noncomputable` because division in the reals isn't computable in Lean's kernel. Since the intended answer `P2013AMCB_5_answer` is a real number that stems from an explicit rational calculation, marking the definition as `noncomputable` resolves the issue.

The given expression `(99 : ℝ) / 4` is a rational division, which should be straightforward once marked noncomputable. Also, considering the numerator `(33 * 11 + 55 * 33)` computes as `33 * 11 + 55 * 33 = 33*11 + 55*33`. Let's verify that:

- `33 * 11 = 363`
- `55 * 33 = 1815`
- Sum: `363 + 1815 = 2178`
- Dividing by `(33 + 55) = 88`, so the expression is `2178 / 88`.

Simplify `2178 / 88`:

- Divide numerator and denominator by 11:

  `2178 / 11 = 198`, since `11 * 198 = 2178`.

- Denominator: `88 / 11 = 8`.

- So the simplified fraction is `198 / 8`.

Reducing further by dividing numerator and denominator by 2:

- `198 / 2 = 99`, `8 / 2 = 4`.

Thus, the value simplifies to `99 / 4`. 

Final answer: mark the definition as `noncomputable` and just assign `99/4` as a rational in `ℝ`.

<<<noncomputable def P2013AMCB_5_answer : ℝ := (99 : ℝ) / 4>>>
