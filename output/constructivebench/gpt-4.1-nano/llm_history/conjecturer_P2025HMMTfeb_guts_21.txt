Given the symmetry and the relations among a, b, c, the pattern suggests the solutions for a, b, c are proportional to the reciprocals of the roots of the cubic polynomial derived from the constraints. Computing the formal relations, the actual solutions are the roots of the polynomial with coefficients scaled to match the constraints. The pattern indicates that the minimal (least) value for the set occurs at the smallest real root derived from these relationships. Based on the explicit relations, the answer simplifies to:

<<<0>>>

because the structure implies that when the variables are scaled to satisfy the conditions cumulatively, the least possible value approaches zero for the given constraints.
