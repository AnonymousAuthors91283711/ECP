The function \(f\) satisfies \(f \circ f = id\) and \(\left| (f i).val - i.val \right| = 2\). For each \(i\), \(f(i)\) is exactly 2 apart from \(i\). Given that \(f\) is involutive and maps elements to elements 2 apart, each element is paired with another distinct element exactly two steps away within the set \(\{0, 1, ..., 9\}\). Each such pair involves two elements that are 2 apart, and the set can be partitioned into 5 disjoint such pairs. Every pair has two elements, and the pairing is symmetric and involutive.

Final answer:
<<<1>>>
, since the set of all such functions corresponds to pairing elements, with exactly 5 pairs, each choice defined by how the elements are paired—exactly one way for each pairing arrangement.
