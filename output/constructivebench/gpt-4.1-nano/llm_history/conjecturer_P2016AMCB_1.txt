The main issue is that the current proposed answer is a textual comment, which is invalid syntax in Lean for defining a value of type ℝ. The goal is to provide a closed-form real number answer, simplified algebraically from the given expression.

Given the expression: 

a := 1/2

the expression:

(2 * a⁻¹ + (a⁻¹ / 2)) / a

can be simplified step by step:

- a⁻¹ = 2, because a = 1/2
- 2 * a⁻¹ = 2 * 2 = 4
- a⁻¹ / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1
- Sum numerator: 4 + 1 = 5
- Divide by a = 1/2: (5) / (1/2) = 5 * 2 = 10

Therefore, the final answer in real numbers is 10.

The fix consists of replacing the invalid textual answer with the constant 10, written as `10` in Lean.
