Ground Truth Answer: 2017 / 1008
Proposed Answer: 2 * (2017 / 2016)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about summing the reciprocals of all natural numbers whose only prime divisors are 2 and 2017.

2. The ground truth answer is 2017/1008.

3. The proposed answer is 2*(2017/2016) = 2017/1008 (after simplification).

4. Simplifying the proposed answer:
   2 * (2017/2016) = (2*2017)/2016 = 2017/1008

5. This exactly matches the ground truth answer.
