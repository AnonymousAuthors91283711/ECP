The pattern shows the total paths as binomial coefficient C(10,5), and the blocked paths as C(x + y, x) * C(10 - x - y, 5 - x). The difference yields the count of unblocked paths, divided by 36. So, the formula simplifies to total_paths - blocked_paths, divided by 36.

  (total_paths - blocked_paths : ℝ) / 36 = omnimath2309_answer x y := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: The pattern shows the total paths as binomial coefficient C(10,5), and the blocked paths as C(x + y, x) * C(10 - x - y, 5 - x). The difference yields the count of unblocked paths, divided by 36. So, the formula simplifies to total_paths - blocked_paths, divided by 36.

The current proposed answer attempts to directly include descriptive text within an `abbrev`, which is invalid syntax in Lean. To fix this, I will define the answer as a function over `x` and `y` that encapsulates the intended formula. Based on the pattern and reasoning, the answer should be the difference of binomial coefficients representing total and blocked paths, divided by 36. 

The enumeration suggests a pattern:
- Total paths: `choose 10 5`
- Blocked paths: `choose (x + y) x * choose (10 - x - y) (5 - x)`
- The answer: `(choose 10 5 - choose (x + y) x * choose (10 - x - y) (5 - x)) / 36`

Therefore, the final closed form in Lean is:

<<<fun x y => (choose 10 5 - choose (x + y) x * choose (10 - x - y) (5 - x)) / 36>>>

This correctly expresses the formula as a function over `x` and `y`, in accordance with the problem statement and the pattern identified.
