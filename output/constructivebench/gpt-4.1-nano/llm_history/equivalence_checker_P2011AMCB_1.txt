theorem P2011AMCB_1 :
    (2 + 4 + 6) / (1 + 3 + 5) - (1 + 3 + 5) / (2 + 4 + 6) = P2011AMCB_1_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 7 / 12
Proposed Answer: 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. First, let's compute the numerator values:
   - (2 + 4 + 6) = 12
   - (1 + 3 + 5) = 9

2. Now compute the expression:
   (12/9) - (9/12) = (4/3) - (3/4) = (16/12) - (9/12) = 7/12

The ground truth answer correctly shows this computation results in 7/12.

The proposed answer is 1, which is incorrect as it doesn't match the computed value of 7/12.
