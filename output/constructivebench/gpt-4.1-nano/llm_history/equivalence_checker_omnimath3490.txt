Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 8 * n
Proposed Answer: fun n => n * 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function f(n) that satisfies 5 conditions when n=7:
   - f(n) must be even
   - 9*n must be odd
   - n+8 must be odd
   - n² must be odd
   - n*(n-2) must be odd

2. For n=7:
   - Ground truth (8*n=56) is even (satisfies first condition)
   - Proposed answer (n*9=63) is odd (fails first condition)

3. The other conditions are constraints on n itself (all must be odd for n=7):
   - 9*7=63 (odd)
   - 7+8=15 (odd)
   - 7²=49 (odd)
   - 7*5=35 (odd)
   These are all correct for n=7, but irrelevant since the proposed answer fails the first condition.

The proposed answer fails the primary requirement that f(n) must be even when n=7.
