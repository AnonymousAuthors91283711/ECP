Ground Truth Answer: 23
Proposed Answer: (3 : ℚ) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem involves calculating the ratio p1/p2 where:
p1 = (24 * 22! * 3!) / 26!
p2 = (23 * 23! * 2!) / 26!

The ground truth answer is 23, while the proposed answer is 3/2.

Let's compute p1/p2:
p1/p2 = [(24 * 22! * 3!)/26!] / [(23 * 23! * 2!)/26!]
= (24 * 22! * 3!) / (23 * 23! * 2!)
= (24 * 3!)/(23 * 23 * 2!) [since 23! = 23 * 22!]
= (24 * 6)/(23 * 23 * 2)
= 144/(23 * 46)
= 144/1058
= 72/529

This is clearly not equal to either 23 or 3/2. However, the ground truth answer of 23 appears to be incorrect based on this calculation, while the proposed answer of 3/2 is also incorrect.

Given that neither answer matches our calculation, but the ground truth was provided as authoritative, we should consider the proposed answer as incorrect.
