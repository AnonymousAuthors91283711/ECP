theorem P2002AIMEII_12 :
  ∃ (p q r s : ℕ) (a b c : ℕ),
    p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ r.Prime ∧ s.Prime ∧
    a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ c > 0 ∧
    (p + q + r + s) * (a + b + c) = P2002AIMEII_12_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the primes p, q, r, s > 0, and positive a, b, c, the product (p + q + r + s)(a + b + c) scales with their sum than individual negatives. Empirical pattern suggests minimal values aggregate to the product of minimal primes and minimal positive integers (1). The minimal prime set is (2, 3, 5, 7). Sum is 17, and minimal positive a, b, c sum to 3 (if all are 1). Final answer: (17) * (3) = 51.

<<<17 * 3>>>
