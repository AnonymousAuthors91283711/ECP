Since the given equations equate two fractions to 2/3 and involve terms of x, y, z, w, the solution for x/w simplifies to a constant ratio based on the relation between these variables. The pattern suggests a consistent ratio derived from the balance of the equations. Given the problem context and typical algebraic solutions, the answer is the constant ratio 4/3.
<<<(4/3: ℝ)>>>
