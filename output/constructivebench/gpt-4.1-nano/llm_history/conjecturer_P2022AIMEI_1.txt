The problem involves quadratic polynomials with specified degree and leading coefficients, values at points, and sums to be evaluated. Both P and Q are degree 2 with leading coefficients 2 and -2, respectively, and specific evaluations at 16 and 20.

Since P and Q are quadratic, and their leading coefficients are provided, I deduce their general forms considering the evaluations, along with the symmetry in data.

From the pattern of the evaluations and coefficients, P and Q seem symmetric with respect to certain terms, leading to a sum at zero that simplifies to constants based on their coefficients and the evaluation points. The calculations indicate the sum P.eval 0 + Q.eval 0 equals 8.

**Final answer**: <<<8>>>
