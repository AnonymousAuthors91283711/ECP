Ground Truth Answer: 3/5
Proposed Answer: 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have two equations:
   - log(x * y³) = 1
   - log(x² * y) = 1

2. From the first equation: log x + 3 log y = 1
3. From the second equation: 2 log x + log y = 1

4. Let a = log x and b = log y. The system becomes:
   - a + 3b = 1
   - 2a + b = 1

5. Solving this system:
   - From the second equation: b = 1 - 2a
   - Substitute into first equation: a + 3(1 - 2a) = 1 → a + 3 - 6a = 1 → -5a = -2 → a = 2/5
   - Then b = 1 - 2*(2/5) = 1/5

6. We need to find log(xy) = a + b = 2/5 + 1/5 = 3/5

The ground truth answer is correct (3/5), while the proposed answer is 1, which is incorrect.
