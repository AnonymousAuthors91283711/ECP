abbrev olympiadbench2560_answer : Set (ℝ × ℝ) := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2560 :
  {p : ℝ × ℝ | p.1 ^ 2 - p.1 * p.2 + 8 = 0 ∧ p.1 ^ 2 - 8 * p.1 + p.2 = 0} = olympiadbench2560_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(-1, -9), (4 + 2 * Real.sqrt 2, 8), (4 - 2 * Real.sqrt 2, 8)}
Proposed Answer: { p : ℝ × ℝ | p.1 ^ 3 - 7 * p.1 ^ 2 + 8= 0 ∧ p.2 = 8 * p.1 - p.1 ^ 2 }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all real pairs (x,y) that satisfy both equations:
   - x² - xy + 8 = 0
   - x² - 8x + y = 0

2. Ground Truth Answer provides three explicit solutions.

3. Proposed Answer gives a different characterization:
   - x³ - 7x² + 8 = 0
   - y = 8x - x²

Let's verify if these are equivalent:

From the second original equation: y = -x² + 8x (matches proposed y expression)
Substitute into first equation:
x² - x(-x² + 8x) + 8 = 0 → x² + x³ - 8x² + 8 = 0 → x³ - 7x² + 8 = 0 (matches proposed x condition)

The proposed answer is algebraically equivalent to the original system. The ground truth shows the explicit solutions to these equations. The proposed answer gives the general form that would yield those solutions when solved.
