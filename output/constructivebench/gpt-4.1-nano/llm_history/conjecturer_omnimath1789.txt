Given the pattern and the specific modulus calculation, the answer appears to relate to the last two digits of \(1032^{1032}\), which simplifies to the last two digits of \(32^{1032}\). Since \(32^2 = 1024\), last two digits are 24; raising to higher powers preserves a pattern with the last two digits cycling between 32 and 24 every step, with \(32^{odd}\equiv 32\) and \(32^{even}\equiv 24\). Since \(1032\) is even, last two digits are 24.

<<<24>>>
