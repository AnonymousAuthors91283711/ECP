Given the set \(\{ z : \mathbb{C} \mid \exists n : \mathbb{N}, z = \frac{(1 + I)^n}{(\sqrt 2)^n} \}\), this simplifies to points expressed as \(\left(\frac{1 + I}{\sqrt 2}\right)^n\).

Note that \(\frac{1 + I}{\sqrt 2} = e^{i \pi/4}\). Since \((1 + I)/\sqrt 2 = e^{i \pi/4}\), powers produce points on the unit circle at increments of \(\pi/4\).

The set in question contains all 8 distinct points corresponding to \(n \bmod 8\), thus \(\operatorname{card} = 8\).

Hence, the finite set's cardinality is always 8, independent of \(n\).
