theorem omnimath2179 : 
  card {s : Finset (Fin 6 × Fin 6) | card s = 3 ∧ ∀ (x y : Fin 6 × Fin 6), x ∈ s → y ∈ s → x ≠ y → x.1 ≠ y.1 ∧ x.2 ≠ y.2} = omnimath2179_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The answer counts the number of 3-element subsets in a 6x6 grid, where no two elements share a row or column. This corresponds to choosing 3 distinct rows and columns and permuting one element in each, which equals combinations of rows times permutations of selected columns: C(6,3) × 3! = 20 × 6 = 120.  

Thus, the final answer:  
<<<120>>>
