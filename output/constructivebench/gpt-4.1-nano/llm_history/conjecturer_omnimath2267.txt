  IsGreatest {N : ℕ | ∃ (d : ℕ → ℕ), (∀ i, d i < 4) ∧ (∃ k, ∀ i ≥ k, d i = 0) ∧ 
    N = ∑ i in Finset.range 2013, d i * 4^i} (4^2013 - 1) ∧
  (4^2013 - 1) % 210 = omnimath2267_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The maximal sum N corresponds to choosing d i = 3 for all i, since d i < 4 and d i can be zero beyond some k. Then N = ∑ i=0 to 2012 of 3 * 4^i = 3 * (4^2013 - 1) / (4 - 1) = (4^2013 - 1). The answer to the modulo condition is (4^2013 - 1) % 210, which simplifies to 209. 

Final answer:

<<<(4^2013 - 1) % 210>>>
