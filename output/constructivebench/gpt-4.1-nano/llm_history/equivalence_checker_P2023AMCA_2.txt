Ground Truth Answer: 9/5
Proposed Answer: (3/4 : ℚ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find the unique rational number w that satisfies the equation:
   1/3 * w + 7/2 * (1/4) = 3/4 * w + 1/2 * (1/4)

2. Let's solve the equation step by step:
   - First, simplify the constants:
     7/2 * (1/4) = 7/8
     1/2 * (1/4) = 1/8
   - The equation becomes: (1/3)w + 7/8 = (3/4)w + 1/8
   - Subtract (1/3)w from both sides: 7/8 = (5/12)w + 1/8
   - Subtract 1/8 from both sides: 6/8 = (5/12)w
   - Simplify 6/8 to 3/4: 3/4 = (5/12)w
   - Multiply both sides by 12/5: w = (3/4)*(12/5) = 36/20 = 9/5

3. The ground truth answer is 9/5, which matches our calculation.

4. The proposed answer is 3/4, which does not match our calculation or the ground truth.
