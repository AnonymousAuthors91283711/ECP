Ground Truth Answer: 5
Proposed Answer: 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the last digit (mod 10) of the sum of squares of multiples of 49 from 1×49 to 49×49.

2. We can rewrite the sum as: 49² × (1² + 2² + ... + 49²)

3. The sum of squares formula is n(n+1)(2n+1)/6. For n=49, this gives 49×50×99/6.

4. The expression becomes: 49² × 49 × 50 × 99 / 6

5. We only care about mod 10:
   - 49 mod 10 = 9
   - 50 mod 10 = 0
   - So the expression is divisible by 10 (has a factor of 50), meaning the result mod 10 is 0.

The ground truth answer is 5, but the correct answer should be 0 (as shown by the calculation). Therefore, the proposed answer is actually correct while the ground truth is wrong.
