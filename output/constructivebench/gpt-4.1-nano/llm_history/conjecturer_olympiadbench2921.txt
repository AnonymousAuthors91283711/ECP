Let's analyze the problem: the sum involves numbers between 0 and 9999 where the first four digits in base 2 and base 5 representations match. For such numbers, leading digits (up to the 4th digit) of both base representations are equal. The pattern suggests the sum is over numbers with fixed initial digit sequences. The total can be expressed by summing over all possible 4-digit prefixes, with the remaining digits free. The possible prefixes are sequences where the first four bits in both bases agree, resulting in a sum over these. Each prefix corresponds to a range of numbers, and summing over these gives the total.

Based on the enumeration, the sum simplifies to the sum of all numbers in those ranges, which corresponds to a formula involving powers of two and five. A plausible closed form is:

sum_{k=0}^{15} sum_{x=0}^{some limit} (numbers with prefix k in base 2 and base 5).

For simplicity, summing over all such prefixes results in a total sum equal to:

\[ \text{sum} = 2^{8} \times 5^{4} \times \frac{(2^{4} - 1)(5^{4} - 1)}{2} \]

but since only first four digits match, the sum simplifies to functions of 2^4 and 5^4, notably 16 and 625, bridging the base representations.

Answer: <<< (2^4 * 5^4 * (2^4 - 1) * (5^4 - 1)) / 2 >>>
