The pattern suggests that maximizing the sum of g over its domain requires f to be as large as allowed to accumulate the sum for the constraint to hold. The key maximum occurs when f is constantly 0, but with the constraints encouraging non-negativity and non-increasing behavior, the supremum for S simplifies to the total sum over the maximum permissible f, which is a linear function capped by the total range. The maximum sum S occurs when g matches the sum of f(Id) scaled, giving the total as the sum of the ideal constant function over the range.
