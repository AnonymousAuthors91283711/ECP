theorem P2012AMCB_6 (x y ε : ℝ) : 
  x > y ∧ y > 0 ∧ ε > 0 → (x + ε) - (y - ε) > x - y ↔ P2012AMCB_6_answer x y ε := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x y ε => x > y ∧ y > 0 ∧ ε > 0 → (x + ε) - (y - ε) > x - y
Proposed Answer: fun x y ε => True
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem states that for x > y > 0 and ε > 0, we need to find when (x+ε)-(y-ε) > x-y holds.

2. Simplifying the inequality:
   (x+ε)-(y-ε) > x-y
   x + ε - y + ε > x - y
   2ε > 0
   Which is always true since ε > 0 by premise.

3. The ground truth answer correctly captures that the inequality holds under the given conditions (x > y > 0 and ε > 0).

4. The proposed answer claims the statement is always True, regardless of conditions. This is incorrect because:
   - If x ≤ y, the original premise fails
   - If y ≤ 0, the original premise fails
   - If ε ≤ 0, the original premise fails

The proposed answer is too general and doesn't account for the necessary conditions.
