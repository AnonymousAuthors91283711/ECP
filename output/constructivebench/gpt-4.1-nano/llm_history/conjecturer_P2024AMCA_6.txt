Since \( a,b,c \) are factors of 60 and sum to \( s \), the minimal positive sum involves the smallest factors, which are 1, 2, 3, etc. The minimal sum of such factors is achieved with \( (1, 2, 30) \), giving sum = 33, or \( (1, 3, 20) \), sum = 24, etc. The least sum from common factorizations is 6 (for 1, 2, 3). Confirming minimal sum: \( 1+2+3=6 \). 

Answer: 6.

<<<6>>>
