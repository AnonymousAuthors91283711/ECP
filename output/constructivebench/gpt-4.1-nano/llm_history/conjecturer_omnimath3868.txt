The key issue is in the syntax of the `abbrev`. In Lean, the parts after `:=` in a set abstraction should express a set of functions, typically defined with a characteristic predicate. The current definition attempts to use `{λ f, ...}`, which Lean doesn't accept as a set notation. Instead, to define a set of functions with a property, we use `{f : ℝ → ℝ | property f}`.

Given the proposed reasoning and the pattern from the enumerated answers, the functions satisfying the conditions are linear functions of the form \(f(x) = c x\) with \(c > 0\). Such functions preserve the ratio structures and ensure the property holds. The condition is about the ratios involving \(f(w), f(x), f(y^2), f(z^2)\), which suggests linearity with positive coefficient.

Thus, the corrected definition uses a set comprehension with a lambda predicate, with the condition that for all positive \(x\), \(f(x) = c x\) with some \(c > 0\):

```lean
{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c > 0, ∀ x > 0, f x = c * x}
```

This correctly defines the set of functions satisfying the property for some positive constant \(c\).

Final answer:
<<<{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c > 0, ∀ x > 0, f x = c * x}>>>
