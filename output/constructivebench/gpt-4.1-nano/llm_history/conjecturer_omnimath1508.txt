  ∑' (n : ℕ), (fib (n + 1) : ℚ) / (4 ^ (n + 2)) = omnimath1508_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Given the sum involves Fibonacci numbers and a geometric denominator, the closed form is known as (1/8).  
The pattern of partial sums converges to this value, suggesting the limit is 1/8.  

<<<(1 : ℚ) / 8>>>
