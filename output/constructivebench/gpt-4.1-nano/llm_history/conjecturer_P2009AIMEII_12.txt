The pattern indicates that the maximum size occurs when selecting pairs with sum ≤ 2009, all distinct, and all satisfying specified inequalities. Optimal pairing maximally fills the sum groups without overlaps, resulting in the largest possible set. Since the problem constraints are symmetric and balance across sums, the greatest size is obtained when pairing each of the 1004 integers with its corresponding partner such that their sum is 2009. This yields pairs `(i, 2009 - i)` for `i` from `1` to `1004`. Therefore, the maximum size is 1004.

<<<1004>>>
