  ∃ (z₁ z₂ z₃ : ℂ), 
    (∀ z ∈ ({z₁, z₂, z₃} : Set ℂ), 
      (re z) ^ 3 - 3 * (re z) * (im z) ^ 2 = 2005 ∧ 
      (im z) ^ 3 - 3 * (re z) ^ 2 * (im z) = 2004) ∧
    (1 - (re z₁) / (im z₁)) * (1 - (re z₂) / (im z₂)) * (1 - (re z₃) / (im z₃)) = omnimath1142_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The given equations suggest that each z satisfies a polynomial with real coefficients involving its real and imaginary parts. The pattern indicates symmetrical solutions where the ratios (re z)/(im z) are complex conjugates or related roots. Testing simple ratios yields the solution where all ratios (re z over im z) are 0, and the constants align as 2005 and 2004 respectively. The answer likely simplifies to 1, as it would normalize the product condition.
