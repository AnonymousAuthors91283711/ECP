Ground Truth Answer: 64
Proposed Answer: 92
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. This is a classic inclusion-exclusion problem with three sets (singers, dancers, actors) where no student is in all three sets simultaneously.

2. Given:
   - Total students = 100
   - Non-singers = 42 ⇒ Singers = 58
   - Non-dancers = 65 ⇒ Dancers = 35
   - Non-actors = 29 ⇒ Actors = 71

3. We need to find the number of students in exactly two groups (since no student is in all three).

4. Using inclusion-exclusion principle:
   Total = Singers + Dancers + Actors - (Exactly two groups) - 2*(All three groups)
   But since no student is in all three groups, the formula simplifies to:
   100 = 58 + 35 + 71 - (Exactly two groups)
   Exactly two groups = 58 + 35 + 71 - 100 = 164 - 100 = 64

The ground truth answer (64) is correct, while the proposed answer (92) is incorrect.
