(hS : S = fun n => ∑ p in Finset.Icc 1 n, (p ^ 5 + p ^ 7))

Given the pattern in the enumerated answers and the structure of the sums involving p^5 + p^7, the GCD of sums over p from 1 to n and 1 to 3n should relate to the sum over the common divisors. Since p varies over integers, the sequence's GCD reflects the divisors common to the exponents, likely factors of 6.

Thus, the answer simplifies to the sum over divisors of n that align with the pattern, which is proportional to n.

Final answer: <<<fun n : ℕ => 2 * n>>>
