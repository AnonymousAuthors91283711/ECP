Ground Truth Answer: {n | n ≡ 0 [MOD 8] ∨ n ≡ 3 [MOD 8]}
Proposed Answer: {n | ∃ k : ℕ, n = 5 * 2^k}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding natural numbers n where the ratio of boys' matches to girls' matches is 7/5 in a tournament scenario.

2. The ground truth answer states that solutions occur when n ≡ 0 mod 8 or n ≡ 3 mod 8.

3. The proposed answer suggests solutions are numbers of the form n = 5*2^k.

Let's test some values:
- For n=8 (≡0 mod 8): The proposed answer would require 8=5*2^k, which isn't possible for integer k.
- For n=3 (≡3 mod 8): The proposed answer would require 3=5*2^k, which isn't possible.
- For n=5 (proposed answer with k=0): 5 ≡5 mod8, not in ground truth.
- For n=10 (proposed answer with k=1): 10 ≡2 mod8, not in ground truth.

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth at all. The forms are completely different.
