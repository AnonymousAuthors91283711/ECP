Since a = 1.5 * b, then (3 * b) / a simplifies to (3 * b) / (1.5 * b) = 3 / 1.5 = 2.  
Expressed as a fraction of 100, this is 200 / 100.

Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 7, which is at "P2019AMCA_2_answer :" in "abbrev P2019AMCA_2_answer : ℝ := 200 / 100", there is an error: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instDivInvMonoid', and it does not have executable code.

The error occurs because `abbrev` definitions in Lean are intended for computable constants, but `Real` operations like division are noncomputable. When defining a constant involving division in ℝ, `noncomputable` should be used to avoid this error. Additionally, based on the problem and the enumerated answer, the simplified form of `(3 * b) / a` when `a = 1.5 * b` should be 2, because:

(3 * b) / (1.5 * b) = 3 / 1.5 = 2.

Therefore, the value of `P2019AMCA_2_answer` is 2, and the code should reflect a noncomputable definition.

The error occurs because you used `abbrev` to define `P2019AMCA_2_answer` but in the proposed answer, you tried to define it with `noncomputable def` on the same identifier, which causes a conflict; also, `abbrev` should directly contain a term, not a block that starts with `noncomputable def`, which is invalid syntax.

From the problem statement, the key relation is:

\[ \frac{3b}{a} = \frac{P2019AMCA_2_answer}{100} \]

Given that \( a = 1.5 * b \), rewrite the left side:

\[
\frac{3b}{1.5b} = \frac{3b}{\frac{3}{2}b} = \frac{3b \times 2}{3b} = 2
\]

So, 

\[
\frac{3b}{a} = 2
\]

Therefore:

\[
2 = \frac{P2019AMCA_2_answer}{100} \implies P2019AMCA_2_answer = 200
\]

The expected result is a real number, specifically 200.

**Final fixed answer:**

<<<
(200 : ℝ)
>>>

This expression is a clean, closed-form real number consistent with the expected answer type and the problem's logic.
