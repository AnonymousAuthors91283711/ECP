Given the constraints, and the pattern in the enumerated answers, the key is the ratio relationships among variables from the product equations. By solving the equations, the simplified answer involves the ratio between \(a, b, c, d\). The consistent solution that fits the pattern and satisfies the equations is when \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\), \(c = 3\), \(d = 4\). This leads to the total sum \(a + b + c + d = 10\).
