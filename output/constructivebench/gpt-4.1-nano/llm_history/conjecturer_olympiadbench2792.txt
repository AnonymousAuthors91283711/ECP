Based on the pattern, the minimal n for which the floor of n^(1/k) are all distinct for k in {1,2,...,8} is n = 256, since 256^1=256, 256^(1/2)=16, 256^(1/3)=6.35≈6, 256^(1/4)=4, 256^(1/5)=3.03≈3, 256^(1/6)=3.03≈3, 256^(1/7)=2.37≈2, 256^(1/8)=2. So, the smallest n satisfying this is 256, where floors differ for each root.
