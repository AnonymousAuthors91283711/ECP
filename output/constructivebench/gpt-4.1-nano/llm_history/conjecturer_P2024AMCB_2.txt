abbrev P2024AMCB_2_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2024AMCB_2 : 10! - 7! * 6! = P2024AMCB_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests that the answer ultimately simplifies to a basic factorial expression. Calculating directly, \(10! - 7! \times 6!\). Since \(7! \times 6! = 7! \times 6!\), which equals \(7! \times 6!\).

The value simplifies to \(10! - 7! \times 6! = 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7! - 7! \times 6!\). Factor out \(7!\):

\(7!( (10 \times 9 \times 8) - 6!)\). Recall, \(6! = 720\), and \(10 \times 9 \times 8 = 720\).

Hence, the answer is \(7! \times (720 - 720) = 0\).

But given the pattern of the problem and the simplified pattern, the answer is explicitly:

<<< ((10 * 9 * 8) - 720) * 7! >>>
