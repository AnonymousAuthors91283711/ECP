Ground Truth Answer: {p : ℕ | p = 2 ∨ p ≡ 3 [MOD 4]}
Proposed Answer: {2, 3}
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the set of prime numbers p where there are exactly p pairs (x,y) modulo p such that p divides y² - x³ - 4x.

2. The ground truth answer suggests this occurs when p=2 or when p ≡ 3 mod 4.

3. The proposed answer only lists {2, 3}.

Analysis:
- For p=2: There are indeed 2 solutions (all pairs (0,0) and (1,1) work), so 2 should be included.
- For p=3: There are exactly 3 solutions (verifiable by enumeration), so 3 should be included.
- However, the ground truth claims all primes ≡ 3 mod 4 satisfy this, which would include primes like 7, 11, etc.
- The proposed answer misses all primes >3 that are ≡3 mod4.

The proposed answer is correct for the cases it lists but incomplete according to the ground truth. It's missing infinitely many primes that satisfy the condition.
