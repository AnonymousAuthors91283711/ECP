    (P : ℝ × ℝ → Prop)
    (hP : P = fun (x, y) => 8 * y ^ 4 + 4 * x ^ 2 * y ^ 2 + 4 * x * y ^ 2 + 2 * x ^ 3 + 2 * y ^ 2 + 2 * x = x ^ 2 + 1) :
    {z | ∃ x y : ℝ, z = x + 2 * y ^ 2 ∧ P (x, y)} = omnimath1544_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The equation simplifies to a quadratic in y with respect to x, leading to solutions where y^2 is determined by (x^2+1 - 2x)/(2x^2+4x+4). This simplifies to y^2 = (x - 1)^2 / (x + 2)^2, hence y = ± (x - 1)/(x + 2). Then, z = x + 2 y^2 = x + 2 * (x - 1)^2 / (x + 2)^2. Simplifying gives z = (x^3 + 2x^2 + x) / (x + 2)^2, covering all real z except possibly at x = -2 where the expression is undefined and the original relation fails to produce solutions. 
Final answer:

<<< {z | ∃ x : ℝ, z = (x^3 + 2 * x^2 + x) / (x + 2)^2}>>>
