Ground Truth Answer: (2/3, 2/9)
Proposed Answer: (0, 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a recurrence relation for E(k) where:
   - E(0) = 0
   - For k > 0, E(k) = 1 + (E(k-1) + E(k-2))/2

2. We're looking for constants (a,b) such that E(n) - a*n - b tends to 0 as n→∞

3. The ground truth answer (2/3, 2/9) suggests the solution behaves asymptotically like (2/3)n + 2/9

4. The proposed answer (0, 2) suggests the solution tends to a constant value of 2

Analysis:
- The recurrence relation describes a linear non-homogeneous recurrence
- The characteristic equation is r² - r/2 - 1/2 = 0 with roots 1 and -1/2
- The general solution is E(n) = A(1)^n + B(-1/2)^n + particular solution
- For the non-homogeneous term 1, the particular solution is a constant C
- Solving gives C = 2/3, so the dominant term is (2/3)n
- The proposed answer (0,2) is incorrect as it misses the linear growth term
