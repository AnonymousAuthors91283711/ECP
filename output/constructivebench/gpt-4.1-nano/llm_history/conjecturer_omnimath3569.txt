abbrev omnimath3569_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3569 (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
    (f 0 + 1 = f 1 ∧ ∀ x y, f (x * y - x) + f (x + f y) = y * f x + 3) ↔ f = omnimath3569_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
Given the functional equation and the initial condition, the solution is linear, with f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, leading to f(x) = x^3.
