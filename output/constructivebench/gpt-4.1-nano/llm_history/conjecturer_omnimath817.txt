Given the pattern that the truth value depends on whether \( (n - 2)! \equiv 0 \pmod{n} \), Wilson's theorem implies that for prime \(n\), \((n - 1)! \equiv -1 \pmod{n}\), and for composite \(n\), \((n - 1)! \equiv 0 \pmod{n}\).

Testing for \( n \geq 2 \), the set of primes \( n \) in \([2, 100]\), counts to 25.

Hence, the count of \( n \in [2, 100] \) where \( (n-2)! \not\equiv 0 \pmod{n} \) is the number of primes in that range = 25.

Final answer: number of composites in the range, i.e., total minus primes = 99 - 25 = 74, but the filter counts those where the congruence does *not* hold—that is, the primes.

Therefore, the total count of exceptions (primes) is 25.

But the filter counts where \( ¬ ((n-2)! \equiv 0 \pmod{n}) \), i.e., primes \( n \).

Final answer: the number of primes 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 is 25.

Thus, the total count is:

<<<25>>>
