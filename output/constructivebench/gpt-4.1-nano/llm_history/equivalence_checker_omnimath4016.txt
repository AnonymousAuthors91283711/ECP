Ground Truth Answer: {110, 143, 242, 341, 440, 164, 263, 362, 461, 560, 198, 297, 396, 495, 594, 693, 792, 891, 990}

<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both define the same set of natural numbers between 100 and 999 (3-digit numbers) where the number plus its reverse equals a perfect square. The proposed answer explicitly breaks down the number into digits (a, b, c) and reconstructs both the original number and its reverse, while the ground truth uses modulo and division operations to achieve the same effect. The constraints on a, b, c ensure they represent valid digits of a 3-digit number. Both formulations will yield exactly the same set of numbers that satisfy the condition.
