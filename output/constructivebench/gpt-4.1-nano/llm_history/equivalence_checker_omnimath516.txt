theorem omnimath516 :
  IsLeast {d : ℕ | ∃ (x y : ℚ), x.den = 60 ∧ y.den = 70 ∧ (x + y).den = d} omnimath516_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 84
Proposed Answer: 420
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest denominator d that can appear in the sum x + y where:
   - x has denominator 60
   - y has denominator 70

2. To find the minimal possible denominator for x + y:
   - x = a/60 where gcd(a,60) = 1
   - y = b/70 where gcd(b,70) = 1
   - x + y = (7a + 6b)/420

3. The denominator of x + y is 420/gcd(7a+6b,420)
   - We need to maximize gcd(7a+6b,420) to minimize the denominator
   - The maximum possible gcd is 5 (achieved when 7a ≡ -6b mod 5)
   - Thus minimal denominator = 420/5 = 84

4. The proposed answer is 420, which would be the case when gcd(7a+6b,420)=1 (minimal case for the numerator)
   - But we can do better by choosing a,b to make the numerator share factors with 420
   - 84 is indeed achievable and smaller than 420
