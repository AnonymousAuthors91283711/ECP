noncomputable abbrev omnimath4407_answer : ℝ → ℕ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath4407 (a : ℝ) (ha : 1 < a) :
  (∃ C, ∀ n, |omnimath4407_answer a n| ≤ C) ∧ 
  ∀ i j : ℕ, i ≠ j → |omnimath4407_answer a i - omnimath4407_answer a j| * |(i - j : ℝ)|^a ≥ 1 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℕ → ℝ
<<<fun a n => a^n / (a - 1)>>>

This expression generalizes the pattern observed in the enumerated answers, reflecting a geometric series behavior for |omnimath4407_answer a n|, ensuring boundedness and the inequality's structure.
