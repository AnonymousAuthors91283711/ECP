theorem P2020AMCB_5 :
  ∃ (a b : ℕ),
    a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧
    2 * a % 3 = 0 ∧
    5 * b % 8 = 0 ∧
    (5 * b / 8) = (2 * a / 3) + 7 ∧
    (3 * b / 8) = (1 * a / 3) + 7 ∧
    a = P2020AMCB_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The constraints imply that \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers satisfying proportional relations with specific divisibility and sum conditions, relating to common multiples of 3, 8, and offering an integer solution for \( a \). Through analysis, the minimal integer solution consistent with all conditions is \( a = 21 \).  
So, the answer is 21.
