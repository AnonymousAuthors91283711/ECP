Ground Truth Answer: 17
Proposed Answer: 50
Let's analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n where:
   - n > 0
   - For every natural number m, there exists a subset of {1,2,...,n} whose product of elements is congruent to m modulo 100

2. The ground truth answer is 17, which means:
   - With numbers 1 through 17, we can create products that cover all remainders modulo 100
   - 16 is insufficient (there's at least one m that can't be represented)

3. The proposed answer is 50, which is:
   - Much larger than 17
   - While it's true that with numbers up to 50 we can certainly cover all remainders (since 17 already does), it's not the minimal solution

The proposed answer fails to find the minimal n that satisfies the condition, which is the core requirement of the problem. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
