Ground Truth Answer: (1/3, -2, 5)
Proposed Answer: (2, 1, 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves solving a system of equations with logarithmic functions (log base a) and three variables (a, b, c).

2. The ground truth answer (1/3, -2, 5) satisfies all the given equations when substituted:
   - For the first equation: log_(1/3)(3 + (-2)) + 5 = log_(1/3)(1) + 5 = 0 + 5 = 5 ✓
   - For the second equation: log_(1/3)(5 + (-2)) + 5 = log_(1/3)(3) + 5 = -1 + 5 = 4 ✓
   - For the third equation: log_(1/3)(11 + (-2)) + 5 = log_(1/3)(9) + 5 = -2 + 5 = 3 ✓

3. The proposed answer (2, 1, 2) does not satisfy the equations:
   - First equation: log₂(3 + 1) + 2 = log₂(4) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4 ≠ 5
   - Already fails the first equation

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy any of the given equations, while the ground truth answer satisfies all of them perfectly.
