theorem omnimath1848
(S : Set ℕ)
(hS : S = {s : ℕ | s > 0 ∧ ∀ p : ℕ, p ∣ s → (p = 2 ∨ p = 2017)})
: (∑' s : S, (1 : ℝ) / s = omnimath1848_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The set S contains positive integers with only the prime factors 2 and 2017, i.e., all s = 2^a * 2017^b with a, b ≥ 0. Therefore, the sum of reciprocals is a product of two geometric series:

∑_{a=0}^∞ (1/2)^a * ∑_{b=0}^∞ (1/2017)^b = (1 / (1 - 1/2)) * (1 / (1 - 1/2017)) = 2 * (2017 / 2016).

Expressed in Lean:

<<<2 * (2017 / 2016)>>>
