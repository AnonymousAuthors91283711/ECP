The conditions imply an arithmetic sequence with difference d, and the relation involving squares and product likely constrains specific triple patterns. Analyzing the pattern from enumerations, the sum over all such c appears to sum integers from -99 to 99, inclusive.

Thus, the total sum sums all c satisfying the conditions, leading to the sum of an arithmetic sequence symmetric about zero:

Sum of c in [-99..99] = 0.

Hence, the sum is 0, and the sum of all such c's cancel out symmetrically.
