Given the equations ⌊x⌋ * x = 36 and ⌊y⌋ * y = 71 with x, y > 0, the solutions are x = 36 / ⌊x⌋ with the same for y. To satisfy the equations, the floors multiply back to these constants, implying the floors are divisors of 36 and 71 respectively. The possible pairs are tied to the divisors of each constant. The pattern suggests considering (m, n) with m dividing 36, n dividing 71. The total sum is then x + y. The minimal positive solutions occur with floor = 6 for 36 and floor = 71 for 71, making x=6, y=71. Noticing the pattern, the sum becomes 6 + 71 = 77, which aligns with the enumerated pattern. So, the sum simplifies to 77.
