The conditions imply \(a=1+1/a\), so \(a\) satisfies \(a^2 - a - 1=0\), giving \(a=\frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}\). Similarly for \(b\), but \(a \neq b\), so the solutions are the conjugates \(\frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}\). The sum \(a+b\) is \(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = 1\). 

Hence the answer is constant at 1, regardless of specific roots, by symmetry.
