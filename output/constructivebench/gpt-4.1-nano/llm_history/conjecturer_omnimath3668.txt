  (∀ x > 0, ∀ y > 0, f (y * (f x)^3 + x) = x^3 * f y + f x) ↔ f = omnimath3668_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
Given the functional equation and positivity condition, the pattern suggests that the solution f(x) = x transforms the relation into an identity, satisfying the functional equation. This aligns with the functioning of a linear, positive, multiplicative structure.
