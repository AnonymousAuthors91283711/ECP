Ground Truth Answer: (2019, 1010)
Proposed Answer: (Nat.choose (2 * 1008) 1008, Nat.choose (2 * 1008 - 1) 1007)
Let me analyze this carefully.

1. The problem involves a Fibonacci-like sequence F and a polynomial p of degree 1008 that matches F at odd points up to 2017 (since 2*1008+1=2017).

2. The ground truth answer suggests evaluating at 2019 (which is beyond the interpolation points) and relates it to F(2019) - F(1010).

3. The proposed answer uses binomial coefficients (Nat.choose) which don't seem to relate to either the Fibonacci sequence or the polynomial evaluation in any obvious way.

4. The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially while binomial coefficients have different growth patterns.

5. There's no clear connection between the binomial coefficients given and the expected values (2019, 1010).

The proposed answer appears completely unrelated to the problem's requirements and the ground truth answer. The binomial coefficients don't correspond to any natural solution path for this problem involving Fibonacci numbers and polynomial interpolation.
