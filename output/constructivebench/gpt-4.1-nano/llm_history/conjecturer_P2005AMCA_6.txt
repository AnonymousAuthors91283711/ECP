theorem P2005AMCA_6 :
  ∃ (t : ℝ), 0 < t ∧
  let josh_speed := (4/5) * (13 / t);
  let mike_speed := 13 / t;
  josh_speed * (2 * t) + mike_speed * t = 13 ∧
  mike_speed * t = P2005AMCA_6_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests that the problem is about distances traveled with certain speeds over time, leading to simplification involving ratios. The key relation to solve for the answer involves the ratio of josh's speed to mike's speed and the total distance. Based on the enumeration, the answer likely expresses the distance traveled by Mike as a function of `t`. Since `mike_speed = 13 / t`, the answer is simply the value of `mike_speed * t`, which is `13`.
