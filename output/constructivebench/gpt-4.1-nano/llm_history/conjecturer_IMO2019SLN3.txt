    (h : ∀ a b : ℕ, 0 < a → 0 < b → (2^a - 2^b) ∈ S) :
    (∀ (n : ℕ) (a : Fin (n + 1) → ℤ), 
      (∀ i, a i ∈ S) → 
      ∀ r : ℤ, eval r (∑ i in Finset.range (n + 1), C (a i) * X^i) = 0 → r ∈ S) 
    ↔ S = IMO2019SLN3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℤ
Based on the pattern that the set S contains all integers associated with evaluations of the sum involving binomial coefficients and powers, the set is closed under evaluation of these specific polynomials. The enumeration hints that $S$ encompasses all integers generated by the sums over binomial coefficients, which naturally represent binomial identity outputs. The minimal such set in this context is all multiples of 2, including 0, connected via 2-adic valuations.

Final answer: <<<{z : ℤ | ∃ n : ℕ, z = 2 * n}>>>
