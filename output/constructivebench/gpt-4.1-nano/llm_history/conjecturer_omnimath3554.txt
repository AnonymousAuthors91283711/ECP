theorem omnimath3554 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ n, 0 < n → (IsSquare (∑ k in Finset.range n, f (k+1)))) ∧ (∀ n, 0 < n → (f n ∣ n^3)) ↔ f = omnimath3554_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The pattern suggests \(f(n) = n\) satisfies both conditions: the sum of \(\sum_{k=1}^n (k)\) is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\), which is square only when \(n(n+1)/2\) is a perfect square, and \(f(n) \mid n^3\) is always true for \(f(n)=n\). This fits the pattern for all \(n\).  

Final answer: <<<fun n => n>>>
