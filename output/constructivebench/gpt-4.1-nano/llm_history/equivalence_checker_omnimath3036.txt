Ground Truth Answer: 17
Proposed Answer: (6 * 1000) + (9 * 100) + 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the sum K + L + M + N given a specific equation involving these variables (all between 0 and 9).

2. The equation simplifies to:
6000 + 100K + L - (1000M + 900 + 10N + 4) = 2011
Which further simplifies to:
100K + L - 1000M - 10N = 2011 - 6000 + 904
100K + L - 1000M - 10N = -3085

3. The ground truth answer is 17, which comes from the solution where:
M = 3 (since 1000M must make the equation work)
Then solving gives K=9, L=5, N=0
Thus K+L+M+N = 9+5+3+0 = 17

4. The proposed answer is (6*1000)+(9*100)+4 = 6000+900+4 = 6904, which is completely unrelated to the actual solution.

The proposed answer doesn't solve for K+L+M+N and doesn't match the ground truth answer.
