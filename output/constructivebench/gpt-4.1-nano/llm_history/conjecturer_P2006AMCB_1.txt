theorem P2006AMCB_1 (n : ℕ) (hn : n = 2006) :
  (∑ k in Finset.range n, (-1 : ℤ) ^ (k + 1)) = P2006AMCB_1_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℤ
The pattern suggests the sum alternates between 1 and 0 for even and odd n, respectively. When n = 2006, which is even, the sum equals 1. This pattern generalizes to: sum from 1 to n of (-1)^{k+1} is 1 if n even, else 0. Thus, the closed form is 1 when n is even, 0 otherwise.
