abbrev omnimath3970_answer : Set (Polynomial ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3970 (f : Polynomial ℕ) :
  (∀ (p : ℕ) (n : ℕ), Nat.Prime p → 0 < n → ∃ (q : ℕ) (m : ℕ), Nat.Prime q ∧ 0 < m ∧ eval p f = q ^ m) ↔ f ∈ omnimath3970_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ (n : ℕ), 0 < n ∧ f = X ^ n} ∪ {f | ∃ (q : ℕ) (m : ℕ), Nat.Prime q ∧ 0 < m ∧ f = C (q ^ m)}
Proposed Answer: { f | (∃ p m, p ≥ 2 ∧ m ≥ 1 ∧ f = Polynomial.C (p ^ m) ) } ∪ { 0 }
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer:
- First set: All monomials X^n where n > 0
- Second set: All constant polynomials C(q^m) where q is prime and m > 0

2. Proposed Answer:
- First set: All constant polynomials C(p^m) where p ≥ 2 and m ≥ 1
- Second set: Just the zero polynomial {0}

Differences:
1. The proposed answer misses all non-constant polynomials (X^n terms)
2. The proposed answer includes {0} which isn't in the ground truth
3. The proposed answer's first set allows any p ≥ 2 (not necessarily prime) and any m ≥ 1

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It includes polynomials that shouldn't be there (0 and non-prime-based constants)
- It excludes polynomials that should be there (X^n terms)
