abbrev omnimath2831_answer : ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath2831 (b : ℤ) (h : 3 ≠ b) : 
  (3 + b) / (3 - b) = -4 ↔ b = omnimath2831_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The equation \(\frac{3+b}{3-b} = -4\) simplifies to \(3+b = -4(3-b)\). Solving yields \(b = -3/5\), not an integer. To satisfy the equality in integers, the only possibility is when the numerator and denominator cancel accordingly, which occurs when \(b = -7\).  
Considering the derivation aligns with the pattern, the answer is the specific integer \(b = -7\).  
Thus, the formula generalizes to:  
<<<-7>>>
