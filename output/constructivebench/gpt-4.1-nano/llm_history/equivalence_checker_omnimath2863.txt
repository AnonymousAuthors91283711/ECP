Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 4 * 2
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The problem asks for the cardinality of the set of all functions from Fin 3 (which has 3 elements) to Bool (which has 2 elements). The number of possible functions is 2^3 = 8. The proposed answer "4 * 2" equals 8, which matches the ground truth answer. Therefore, the answers are equivalent.
