theorem P2002AMCB_16 : 
  card {p : Fin 8 × Fin 6 | 3 ∣ (p.1.val + 1) * (p.2.val + 1)} * (1 : ℚ) / (8 * 6) = P2002AMCB_16_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The pattern of divisibility for (p.1.val + 1) * (p.2.val + 1) from enumerations suggests that all pairs with either component divisible by 3 contribute. For p.1 in {2,5} and p.2 in {2,5}, the total count matches 8*6 with 1/4 of pairs satisfying divisibility. As a probability, the answer simplifies to the proportion of such pairs: (number of pairs with at least one factor divisible by 3) over total pairs. Counting confirms  that probability: 1/2. 
Thus, the answer equals 1/2 in ℚ:

<<<(1 : ℚ) / 2>>>
