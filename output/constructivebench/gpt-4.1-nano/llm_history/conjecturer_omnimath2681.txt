The set {n | n > 0 ∧ n^200 < 3^500} contains all positive integers less than the 200th root of 3^500, i.e., n < (3^500)^(1/200) = 3^(500/200) = 3^(5/2). The greatest integer less than 3^(5/2) is 3^2 = 9 because 3^(5/2) = 3^(2 + 1/2) = 9 * √3 ≈ 9 * 1.732 < 15, so the maximum n satisfying the inequality is 9.
