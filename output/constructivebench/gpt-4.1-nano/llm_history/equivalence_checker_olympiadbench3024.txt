Ground Truth Answer: fun T => 125
Proposed Answer:  fun T => 4 * T + 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem gives us T = 55 and asks us to find K that satisfies several conditions.

2. The ground truth answer is K = 125 when T = 55.

3. The proposed answer is K = 4*T + 3, which would give K = 4*55 + 3 = 223 when T = 55.

Now let's check the conditions with T = 55:

For K = 125 (ground truth):
- T - 5 = 50
- 20 < 50 < 125 (true)
- r would be 50/20 = 2.5
- 50 * 2.5 = 125 (matches K)
- 19 < 125 < 231 (4*55+11=231) (true)
- d would be 125-19=106
- 125+106=231 (matches 4*55+11)

For K = 223 (proposed):
- 20 < 50 < 223 (true)
- r would need to satisfy 20*r = 50 ⇒ r=2.5
- Then 50*2.5=125, but K=223 ≠ 125 (fails this condition)
- Also 19 < 223 < 231 is true, but the earlier condition fails

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the key condition that (T-5)*r = K, since it gives a different value for K than what's required by the ratio condition.
