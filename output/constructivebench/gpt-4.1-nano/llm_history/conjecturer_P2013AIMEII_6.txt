The problem seeks the least N > 0 such that no integer k satisfies k^2 = m for all m in the interval [1000N, 1000N + 999]. Since squares grow roughly as n^2, the gaps between squares around 1000N are approximately 2 * √(1000N) in width, which is less than 1000 for large N. The minimum N when the interval fully contains a perfect square, but no perfect square can be constant across all such m, is when the interval shifts from containing consecutive squares to missing the next square entirely. This occurs around N = 1401. 

The by-approximation approach suggests the least N is 1401.
Hence, the answer is:

<<<1401>>>
