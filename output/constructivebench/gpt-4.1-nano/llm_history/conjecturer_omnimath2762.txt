Given the nested radical √(7 + √48), observe that √48 = 4√3, and the expression resembles the sum of squares of integers. The pattern suggests expressing the radical as a binomial square. Recognizing that √(7 + √48) simplifies with m=2 and n=3, leading to m^2 + n^2 = 4 + 9 = 13. 

Final answer: 
<<<13>>>
