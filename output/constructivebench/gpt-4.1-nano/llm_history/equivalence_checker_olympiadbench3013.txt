Ground Truth Answer: 66/7
Proposed Answer: (2^(9/2))
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is a system of logarithmic equations with positive real variables x, y, z.
2. The ground truth answer gives k = 66/7 ≈ 9.42857
3. The proposed answer suggests x*y*z = 2^(9/2) (k = 9/2 = 4.5)

The two answers are clearly different:
- 66/7 ≈ 9.42857
- 9/2 = 4.5

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth. The exponent k is different by a significant margin.
