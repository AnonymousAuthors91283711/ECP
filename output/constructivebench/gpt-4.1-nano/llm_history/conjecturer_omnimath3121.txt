To find the minimal positive difference \(d = a - b\) for factors \(a, b\) of 2010 with \(a > b\), we seek the pair \((a, b)\) with product 2010 and minimal difference. Factoring 2010 shows divisors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30, 67, 134, 201, 335, 402, 670, 1005, 2010. Pairs with minimal difference are (67, 30) or (50, 40), etc. The pair with minimal difference is (67, 30), difference 37. The least \(d = a - b = 37\).
