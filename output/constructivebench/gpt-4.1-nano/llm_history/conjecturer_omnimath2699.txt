The problem reduces to solving \(x + xy = 391\) with \(x > y > 0\). Factoring, \(x(y + 1) = 391\). The divisors of 391 are 1, 17, 23, and 391. Since \(x > y > 0\), and \(x\) divides 391, possible \(x\) are 17, 23, and 391. Corresponding \(y = \frac{391}{x} - 1\); for \(x=17\), \(y= \frac{391}{17} - 1=23-1=22\); for \(x=23\), \(y=17-1=16\); for \(x=391\), \(y=1-1=0\) (discard \(y=0\)). The pairs are \((17, 22)\) and \((23, 16)\). The sums are \(17 + 22 = 39\) and \(23 + 16 = 39\). Both yield sum 39.
