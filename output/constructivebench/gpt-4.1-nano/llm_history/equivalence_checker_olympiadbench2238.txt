Ground Truth Answer: {-1, 0, 1}
Proposed Answer: {x : ℤ | x ∈ [-1, 1]}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer {x : ℤ | x ∈ [-1, 1]} includes all integers from -1 to 1, which is correct for the solution set of the inequality (x² - 3)(x² + 5) < 0. However, the ground truth answer explicitly lists the elements {-1, 0, 1}, which is more precise. The proposed answer is correct in terms of the solution set but is expressed in interval notation rather than explicitly listing the elements. The two answers are equivalent in terms of the actual solutions, but their representations differ.
