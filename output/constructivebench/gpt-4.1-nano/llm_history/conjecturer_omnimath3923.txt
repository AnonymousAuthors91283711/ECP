The pattern from enumerated answers suggests the pairs (m, n) for which the property holds are those where m and n satisfy a specific quadratic relation derived from the invariant preservation condition. Since the induction involves addition of terms like x² + kxy + y², their invariance hints that (m, n) must lie on a particular quadratic curve, likely m² - m n + n² ≤ 1, capturing the boundary cases.
