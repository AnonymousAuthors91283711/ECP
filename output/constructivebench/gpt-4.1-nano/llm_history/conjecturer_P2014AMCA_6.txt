theorem P2014AMCA_6 : 
  ∃ (x : ℕ), x ∈ Icc 10 99 ∧ 
  ∃ (a b : ℕ), a ∈ Icc 1 9 ∧ b ∈ Icc 0 9 ∧ 
    x = 10 * a + b ∧ 
    (10 * a + b) - (10 * b + a) = 5 * (a + b) ∧ 
    (10 * a + b) + (10 * b + a) = P2014AMCA_6_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern shows symmetric combinations around two digits a, b, with constraints that relate their linear combinations; the given equations revolve around the difference and sum of two two-digit numbers. Considering these constraints, the resulting answer simplifies to x = 55, which is the midpoint (average) value satisfying the difference and sum conditions.

<<<55>>>
