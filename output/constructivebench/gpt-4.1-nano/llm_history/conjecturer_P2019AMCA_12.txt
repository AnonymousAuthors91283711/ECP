theorem P2019AMCA_12 (x y : ℝ) (hx : x > 0 ∧ x ≠ 1) (hy : y > 0 ∧ y ≠ 1) 
  (h1 : logb 2 x = logb y 16) (h2 : x * y = 64) : 
  (logb 2 (x / y))^2 = P2019AMCA_12_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The relation log_b 2 x = log_b y 16 implies (x/y)^2 relates to the powers of 2, and with xy=64, we find (x/y)^2 = 16. Hence, the answer is the square of log_2(x/y): (log_b 2 (x / y))^2 = 4.  
Therefore, the answer: <<<4>>>
