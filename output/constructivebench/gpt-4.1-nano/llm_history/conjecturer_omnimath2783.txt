  ∃! (n : ℕ), n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) = 27 ∧ n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) = omnimath2783_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sum n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3, solving for n gives n=8; substituting n into the product yields 8*9*10=720. The unique n is 8, and the product is 720.

<<<720>>>
