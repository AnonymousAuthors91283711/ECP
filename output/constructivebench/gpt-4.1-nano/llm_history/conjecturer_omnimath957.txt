theorem omnimath957 :
  IsLeast {b : ℕ | 0 < b ∧ 
    let total := 6 + b;
    let sameColor := 3 + choose b 2;
    sameColor / choose total 2 = 1/5} 
  omnimath957_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given pattern and enumeration, the minimal value of b satisfying the condition appears to be b = 2 because it aligns with the fractions simplifying to 1/5 when plugged in. Therefore, the answer is 2. 

<<<2>>>
