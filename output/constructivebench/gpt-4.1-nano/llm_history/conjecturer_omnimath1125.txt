The sequence is defined as a 0 = 1 and a n = 2 ^ a (n - 1). The values grow extremely rapidly, but when considering n=15 mod 10, we focus only on last digit. Since 2^x mod 10 cycles every 4 in x, and a n = 2 ^ a (n-1)) with a 0 = 1. The pattern of last digit a n mod 10 stabilizes as 2, 4, 6, 8, then repeats. For n=15, 15 mod 4 ≡ 3, so last digit is 6. So, the answer is 6.

<<<6>>>
