abbrev omnimath3410_answer : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3410 (x y : ℝ) : 20 * (x + y) - 19 * (y + x) = omnimath3410_answer x y := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
Given the expression 20*(x + y) - 19*(y + x), since addition is commutative, the expression simplifies to (20 - 19)*(x + y) = 1 * (x + y) = x + y. Hence, the answer is the sum of x and y in a closed form.
