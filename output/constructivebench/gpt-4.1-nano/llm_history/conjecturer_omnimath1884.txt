The pattern suggests the minimal n for which factorial products surpass (n!)^2. Since for n=4, the product of 1!·2!·3! is 12, less than (4!)^2=576, and for n=5, the product 1!·2!·3!·4! = 24, still less than 576. Next, for n=6, product is 1!·2!·3!·4!·5! = 120, still less than (6!)^2=5184. For n=7, product is 1!·2!·3!·4!·5!·6! = 720, which is less than (7!)^2=254016. When n=8, product (up to 7) is 5040, which is less than (8!)^2=40320^2, so we check higher n. At n=9, with product 40320, less than (9!)^2=131681894400, but at n=10, the product becomes 1!·…·9! = 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, 362880. The cumulative product at n=10 is approximately 2.88e12, exceeding (10!)^2 ≈ 8.23e12. Actually, the product surpasses (n)!^2 starting from n=10. Checking earlier, at n=9, the product is less than (9!)^2, but at n=10, it exceeds. Therefore, the minimal n is 10. Thus, the answer is 10. 

Final Answer:
<<<10>>>
