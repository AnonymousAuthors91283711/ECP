noncomputable abbrev P2015AMCA_1_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2015AMCA_1 :
  (5 * ((2^0 - 1 + 5^2 - 0)^(-1 : ℝ)) = P2015AMCA_1_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the pattern in the enumeration and the expression involving powers, inverse, and constants, the simplified closed-form expression is based on the sum of powers of 5 and 2 with specific arithmetic. The pattern points towards the value of n=2 in the geometric sum involving powers. 

Conjecturing from the pattern, the final answer is:

<<<5 * (2^0 - 1 + 5^2 - 0)^(-1 : ℝ)>>>

which simplifies to

<<<5 * (1 - 1 + 25 - 0)^(-1 : ℝ)>>>

thus

<<<5 * (25)^(-1 : ℝ)>>>

which is

<<<5 / 25>>>

or simplified to

<<<1 / 5>>>
