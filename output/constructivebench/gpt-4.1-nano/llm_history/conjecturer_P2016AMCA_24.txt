The minimal \( a \) satisfying the cubic's root conditions is obtained at \( a = 3 \). The discriminant and symmetry suggest the unique \( b \) that works correspond to the triple root structure. The value \( b = 6 \) matches the pattern seen in the enumerated solutions, reflecting the symmetric polynomial relationships.
