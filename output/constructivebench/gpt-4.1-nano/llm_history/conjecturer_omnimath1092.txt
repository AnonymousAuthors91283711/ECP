Given N is not a prime power, the set involves divisors with a coloring function avoiding equalities at gcd divisors, maximizing the distinct images under f.

In such cases, the maximum number of colors that can be assigned to divisors to satisfy the constraints is 4, matching the size of the codomain Fin 4.

Thus, the greatest such c is 4.
