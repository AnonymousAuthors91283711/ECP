Given the pattern of the answers involving powers modulo 125, the possible remainders are all integers from 0 to 124 because for any integer \( n \), the value \( n^{100} \mod 125 \) can produce any residue in this set, leveraging Euler's theorem and properties of modular arithmetic. Therefore, the range of \( n^{100} \mod 125 \) covers all residues from 0 to 124.

Final answer:
<<<125>>>
