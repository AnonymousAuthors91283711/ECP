The enumeration suggests looking for the smallest number greater than 72 with the same prime factors as 72. Since \( 72 = 2^3 * 3^2 \), the smallest such will be the smallest number with these prime exponents > 72. Minimal is achieved with the prime factors in lowest terms, i.e., \( 2^3 * 3^2 = 72 \), so looking for the next greater number with the same prime exponents is simply \( 2^3 * 3^2 * 1 = 72 \), but greater than 72, multiply by smallest factor > 1 that preserves factorization exponents: 2 * 3 = 6, but consider next possible: \( 2^4 * 3^2 = 144 \). Hence, the minimal number with same prime factors greater than 72 is 144. 

Answer:
<<<144>>>
