theorem P2010AMCA_20
  (a b : ℕ → ℤ)
  (h1 : a 1 = 1 ∧ b 1 = 1)
  (h2 : (∀ n, a n < a (n + 1) ∧ b n < b (n + 1)) ∧ a 2 ≤ b 2)

  IsGreatest {n | a n * b n = 2010} P2010AMCA_20_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests that the sequence product reaches 2010 at the minimal index satisfying the inequality conditions. Since 2010 factors into primes 2, 3, 5, 67, and their product, and the sequences are increasing with initial values 1, the minimal n is 6. Thus, the answer is 6.

<<<6>>>
