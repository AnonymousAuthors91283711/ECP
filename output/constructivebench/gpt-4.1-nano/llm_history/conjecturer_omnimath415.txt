Based on pattern analysis, the form relates to the maximum n within the interval and the summation constraints, considering the structure of ranges and sums. The maximum n satisfying the specified conditions is 6, since the game involves moves restricted between 1 and 6, and the sum condition reaches 30 at n=6. Therefore, the answer is the maximum boundary value 6.

<<<6>>>
