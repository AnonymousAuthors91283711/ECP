abbrev omnimath3441_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3441 :
  {n : ℕ | 10^n ≤ 2014 ∧ 2014 ≤ 10^(n+1)} = omnimath3441_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Given the inequalities 10^n ≤ 2014 ≤ 10^(n+1), n must satisfy 10^n ≤ 2014 < 10^(n+1). Since 10^3=1000 ≤2014<10000=10^4, the only n that satisfies this is n=3. So, the set of such n is {3}.
