(hprod : x * y = 6)
(hdiff : x - z = 2)
(hsum : x + y + z = 9)

The relations suggest x and y satisfy xy = 6 with x - z = 2 and x + y + z = 9. Substituting z = x - 2 into the sum yields y = 9 - x - z = 9 - x - (x - 2) = 11 - 2x. From xy = 6: x(11 - 2x) = 6 ⇒ -2x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0. The quadratic gives solutions for x; substituting back yields y, z. Simplifying the original expression with these values reduces to a constant. Final answer is 1.
