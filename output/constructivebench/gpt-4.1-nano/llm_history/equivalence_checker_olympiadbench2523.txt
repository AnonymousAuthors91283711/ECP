Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0), (0, 5 / 2), (1 / 2, 0), (-1 / 2, 0), (3 / 2, 4), (-1, 3 / 2)}
Proposed Answer: { (0,0), (0, 5/2), (1/2, 0), (1/2, 3), (-1/2, 0), (-1/2, 2), (3/2, 4), (-1, 3/2) }
Let's analyze the problem and both answers carefully.

The problem asks to find all real pairs (x,y) that satisfy both equations:
1. x*(1/2 + y - 2x²) = 0
2. y*(5/2 + x - y) = 0

This gives us cases to consider based on when each factor is zero.

Ground Truth Answer provides 6 solutions, while Proposed Answer provides 8 solutions.

Comparing the solutions:
1. (0,0) - appears in both (correct)
2. (0,5/2) - appears in both (correct)
3. (1/2,0) - appears in both (correct)
4. (-1/2,0) - appears in both (correct)
5. (3/2,4) - appears in both (correct)
6. (-1,3/2) - appears in both (correct)

The Proposed Answer adds two extra solutions:
7. (1/2,3) - Let's check: 
   For x=1/2, second equation becomes y*(5/2 + 1/2 - y) = y*(3 - y) = 0 ⇒ y=0 or y=3
   But first equation with x=1/2: (1/2)*(1/2 + y - 2*(1/2)²) = (1/2)*(y) = 0 ⇒ y=0
   So (1/2,3) doesn't satisfy both equations.

8. (-1/2,2) - Similarly:
   For x=-1/2, second equation: y*(5/2 -1/2 - y) = y*(2 - y) = 0 ⇒ y=0 or y=2
   First equation with x=-1/2: (-1/2)*(1/2 + y - 2*(1/4)) = (-1/2)*(y) = 0 ⇒ y=0
   So (-1/2,2) doesn't satisfy both equations.

The Proposed Answer includes two incorrect solutions while containing all correct ones. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
