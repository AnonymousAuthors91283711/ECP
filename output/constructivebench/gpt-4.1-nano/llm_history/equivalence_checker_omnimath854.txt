Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: 360
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the count of numbers n between 1 and 2004 where the exponent of 7 in n!'s prime factorization equals the exponent of 8 in n!'s prime factorization.

2. The ground truth answer is 4, which suggests there are only 4 such numbers in this range.

3. The proposed answer is 360, which is significantly larger.

Key observations:
- The exponent of 7 in n! grows much more slowly than the exponent of 8 (which is floor(n/2) + floor(n/4) + floor(n/8) + ...)
- For these exponents to be equal is quite rare, especially as n grows
- The ground truth answer of 4 seems more plausible given how quickly the exponent of 8 grows compared to 7

Conclusion: The proposed answer of 360 is too large and incorrect.
