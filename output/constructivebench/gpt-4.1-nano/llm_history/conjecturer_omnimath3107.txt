  ∀ x : ℝ, 4 * x + 14 = 8 * x - 48 → 2 * x = omnimath3107_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The given equation is \(4x + 14 = 8x - 48\). Solving for \(x\), subtract \(4x\) from each side: \(14 = 4x - 48\), then add 48: \(62 = 4x\), so \(x = 62 / 4 = 31 / 2\). The problem asks for \(2x\), which is \(2 \times (31/2) = 31\). 
Thus, the answer is a constant 31 in ℝ.  

<<<31>>>
