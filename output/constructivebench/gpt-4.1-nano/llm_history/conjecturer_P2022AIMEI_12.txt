The pattern suggests that P relates to the sum of two scaled values of S at n and n−1, divided by their gcd, then modulo 1000. Since S counts intersections over all pairs of subsets, this sum simplifies symmetrically. The enumeration points towards a pattern like (n + n−1) / gcd(n, n−1), which is approximately n + (n−1).

Therefore, the simplified form: (n + (n - 1)) / gcd(n, n - 1) + 1 mod 1000. For n=2022, the gcd is 1, giving 2022 + 2021 + 1.

Final answer: ***2022 + 2021 + 1 = 4044*** modulo 1000 is ***44***.

Current Proposed Answer: The pattern suggests that P relates to the sum of two scaled values of S at n and n−1, divided by their gcd, then modulo 1000. Since S counts intersections over all pairs of subsets, this sum simplifies symmetrically. The enumeration points towards a pattern like (n + n−1) / gcd(n, n−1), which is approximately n + (n−1).

Therefore, the simplified form: (n + (n - 1)) / gcd(n, n - 1) + 1 mod 1000. For n=2022, the gcd is 1, giving 2022 + 2021 + 1.

The main issues stem from the placeholder "The pattern suggests..." text being included directly in the answer definition, which is invalid syntax in Lean. Also, I need to provide a clean, closed-form answer based on the identified pattern. The heuristic based on enumeration and symmetry suggests the sum involving sizes of intersections over all pairs of subsets simplifies to an expression like (n + (n - 1)) divided by gcd(n, n - 1), plus a constant, then taken mod 1000. Since gcd(n, n - 1) = 1 for all n > 1, the sum becomes n + (n - 1). Adding 1 as an adjustment gives a final result of 2n, specifically for n=2022, giving 4044, which mod 1000 is 44.

Therefore, the fixed final answer in Lean syntax should be a straightforward constant `44`.
