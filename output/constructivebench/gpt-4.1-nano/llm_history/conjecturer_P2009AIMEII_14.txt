The pattern suggests \(a_n = c \cdot 2^n\) with initial condition \(a_0=0\), implying \(a_n=0\) for all \(n\). The recurrence simplifies to \(a_{n+1} = \frac{8}{5}a_n + \frac{6}{5} \cdot 2^n\), where the homogeneous solution is zero and the particular solution is \(a_n = 3 \cdot 2^n\). Therefore, \(\lfloor a_{10} \rfloor = 3 \times 2^{10} = 3072\).
