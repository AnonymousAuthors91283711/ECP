The problem involves maximizing a sum of triple products of variables under constraints, suggesting symmetry and boundary analysis. The minimal product constraint \( x_0 x_2 x_4 \ge 1/540 \) indicates the variables related to the minimal points for the sum. The symmetric form of the sum hints toward setting all variables equal to optimize the sum under the geometric constraint. 

From the pattern in enumerated answers and the symmetry, the product appears to be maximized when all \(x_i\) are equal, and the minimal triple product is \(1/540\), leading to each \(x_i = \sqrt[3]{1/540}\). The sum of the six terms then is the sum of six terms each equal to \(x_i^3 = 1/540\). 

Thus, the maximum sum \(m\) is approximately: 

6 * \(x_i^3\) = \(6 / 540 = 1/90\).

Between numerator and denominator, for the pairing and ratio form, the answer reduces to a nice ratio of numerator 1 over denominator 90. 

The supposed greatest value \(m\) numerically is just 1/90. 

In rational form, since the constraints are symmetric, and the minimal product is exactly \(1/540\), the maximum sum is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{90}}\).

Answer in Lean form: 

<<<(1, 90)>>>
