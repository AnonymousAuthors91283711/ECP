theorem omnimath3876 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ m n : ℕ, f (f n + f m) = m + n) ↔ f = omnimath3876_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The pattern suggests the function satisfies a recursive-like relation involving symmetry and addition. The structure indicates the solution is linear, specifically \(f(n) = n\). These types of functional equations often lead to the identity function as a solution.
