  (P^[6]) S₀ = (-7, -1) ↔ S₀ = olympiadbench2283_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℤ × ℤ
The pattern of iterative application suggests transforming initial S₀ through the function P to reach the result (-7, -1). Analyzing the transformation, after 6 iterations, the initial coordinates must satisfy:  
x_{6} = -x_{0}, y_{6} = - y_{0} + 12. Setting x_{6} = -7, y_{6} = -1, yields: x_{0} = 7, y_{0} = 13.  
Thus, initial S₀ = (7, 13).  
Answer:
<<<(7, 13)>>>
