  Nat.card {x : ℝ | -19 < x ∧ x < 98 ∧ cos x ^ 2 + 2 * sin x ^ 2 = 1} = omnimath1453_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The set reduces to all x where the equation holds, which simplifies to an identity. The interval length is 117 (from -19 to 98). The solution covers all real x satisfying the inequality, so the cardinality is the length of the interval: 117.
