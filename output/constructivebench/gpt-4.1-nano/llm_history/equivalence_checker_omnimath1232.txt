Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the largest natural number d that divides (2002^n + 2) for all n ≥ 1.

2. The ground truth answer is 6, which is correct because:
   - 2002 ≡ 4 mod 6 ⇒ 2002^n ≡ 4^n mod 6
   - 4 ≡ -2 mod 6 ⇒ 4^n ≡ (-2)^n mod 6
   - So 2002^n + 2 ≡ (-2)^n + 2 mod 6
   - For odd n: (-2)^n + 2 = -2^n + 2 ≡ 0 mod 6 (since 2^n ≡ 2 mod 6 for odd n)
   - For even n: (-2)^n + 2 = 2^n + 2 ≡ 0 mod 6 (since 2^n ≡ 4 mod 6 for even n ≥ 2)
   - Also, 6 is maximal since no larger number divides all these terms

3. The proposed answer is 2, which is partially correct because:
   - 2 does divide all terms (2002^n + 2 is always even)
   - However, it's not the maximal such number (6 is larger and also works)

The proposed answer is correct in that 2 is a common divisor, but incorrect in that it's not the greatest common divisor for all n.
