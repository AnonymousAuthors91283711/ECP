Ground Truth Answer: 11/21
Proposed Answer: (3 / 6 : ℚ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the probability that a randomly selected dot from a 6-sided die will be on an odd-numbered face.

2. Ground Truth:
- Total dots = 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21
- Odd-numbered faces (1,3,5) have 1+3+5 = 9 dots
- Even-numbered faces (2,4,6) have 2+4+6 = 12 dots
- Probability = odd dots / total dots = 9/21 = 3/7 (simplified)

3. Proposed Answer:
- 3/6 suggests counting the number of odd faces (3) divided by total faces (6)
- This is incorrect because it counts faces rather than dots

The ground truth answer should be 9/21 (which simplifies to 3/7), not 11/21. However, the proposed answer (3/6) is also incorrect as it uses the wrong counting method.
