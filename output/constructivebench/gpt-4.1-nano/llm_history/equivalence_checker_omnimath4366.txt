Ground Truth Answer: { (x, y, z) | x = y ∧ y = z }
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1, 1)}
<<<Close>>>
The ground truth answer states that the equation holds when x=y=z, which is correct for all positive natural numbers where this condition holds. The proposed answer {(1,1,1)} is a specific case of this general solution. While (1,1,1) does satisfy the equation, it's not the complete solution set. The proposed answer is therefore partially correct but incomplete.
