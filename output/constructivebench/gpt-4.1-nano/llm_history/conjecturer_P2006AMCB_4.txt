abbrev P2006AMCB_4_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2006AMCB_4 : 
  IsLeast {p : ℝ | ∃ (change : ℝ), 
    change = 20 - (7.99 + 4.99 + 2.99 + 1.99 + 0.99) ∧ 
    p = |(change / 20 * 100) - P2006AMCB_4_answer|} 0 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The total sum of the given values is 7.99 + 4.99 + 2.99 + 1.99 + 0.99 = 19.94. The change is 20 - 19.94 = 0.06. The percentage difference from 20 is (0.06 / 20) * 100 = 0.3%. So, the answer is 0.3. 

<<<0.3>>>
