Let's analyze the conditions:

Given p = (a, b), with a, b > 0.

Conditions:
1. a + b + gcd a b ^ 2 = lcm a b
2. lcm a b = 2 * lcm (a - 1) b

From the pattern, the relation suggests a specific structure where the gcd and lcm relate via powers and the linear relation in a and b. The constraints imply that for each b > 0, a must be such that the equations hold, likely with a proportionality involving powers of 2.

The solution satisfies that a is 2 more than b, and gcd(a, b) divides b, leading to a pattern where a = 2b, with gcd a b = b, and lcm a b = 2a.

Final pattern suggests that the set includes pairs where a = 2b with b > 0.

Thus, the explicit set is:

<<< {(b * 2, b) | b > 0} >>

which can be expressed as:

<<< { (2 * b, b) | b > 0 } >>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

To fix the Lean code, I need to remove the explanatory text and replace it with a clean, syntactically correct answer. 

Based on the pattern deduced—pairs where \(a = 2b\) with \(b > 0\)—the set can be expressed as \(\{ (2b, b) \mid b > 0 \}\). This matches the pattern observed and satisfies the conditions roughly.

The key is to write this as a Lean expression: a set of pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a = 2 * b\) and \(b > 0\).

Here's the corrected answer:

 <<<{ (2 * b, b) | b > 0 }>>>

This set explicitly describes all pairs where \(a\) is twice \(b\), and \(b\) is positive, aligning with the deduction.
