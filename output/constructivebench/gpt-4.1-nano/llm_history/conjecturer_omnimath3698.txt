The enumeration suggests the solutions are parametrized by the minimal exponents due to the exponential dominance. Most patterns arise from the case when \( x = y = z = 0 \) or the case involving minimal differences. Based on this, the generalized solution set includes the tuple \((0,0,0)\) and all triples where the sum of exponents corresponds to the pattern \( (0, 1, 1) \), reflecting the case where powers of 2014 and 2015 approximate 2013.

To address the problem, we note that the equation \( 2013^x + 2014^y = 2015^z \) involves exponential growth with base 2013, 2014, and 2015. When \( x, y, z \) are small, solutions are trivial, such as \( (0, 0, 0) \). For larger exponents, because \( 2015^z \) grows faster than either \( 2013^x \) or \( 2014^y \), solutions where the exponents are equal or differ by small amounts are relevant.

The enumeration hints that the solutions include \( (0,0,0) \) and a special solution \( (0, 1, 1) \) where \( 2013^0 + 2014^1 = 1 + 2014 = 2015 \), which equals \( 2015^1 \). No other simple solutions appear in the enumeration, implying a focus on these base solutions.

Based on this, a general closed-form candidate in Lean, capturing solutions at these key points, is:

<<<
{ (0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1) }
>>>

This set contains the trivial solution and the one with minimal exponents that satisfies the equation, matching the enumeration, and respects the exponential growth constraints.
