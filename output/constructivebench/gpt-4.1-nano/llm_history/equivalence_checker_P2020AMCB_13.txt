Ground Truth Answer: sqrt (log 6 / log 2 + log 6 / log 3)
Proposed Answer: (sqrt (log 3 / log 2) + sqrt (log 2 / log 3))
Let me analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

The proposed answer is: sqrt(log 3 / log 2) + sqrt(log 2 / log 3)
The ground truth answer is: sqrt(log 6 / log 2 + log 6 / log 3)

Let's simplify the ground truth answer:
sqrt(log 6 / log 2 + log 6 / log 3) = sqrt((log 6 * log 3 + log 6 * log 2)/(log 2 * log 3))
= sqrt(log 6 (log 3 + log 2)/(log 2 log 3))
= sqrt(log 6 * log 6/(log 2 log 3)) [since log 3 + log 2 = log 6]
= sqrt((log 6)^2/(log 2 log 3))
= log 6 / sqrt(log 2 log 3)

Now let's square the proposed answer:
(sqrt(log 3/log 2) + sqrt(log 2/log 3))^2 
= log 3/log 2 + log 2/log 3 + 2 * sqrt((log 3/log 2)*(log 2/log 3))
= (log 3)^2 + (log 2)^2 + 2 log 2 log 3)/(log 2 log 3)
= (log 3 + log 2)^2/(log 2 log 3)
= (log 6)^2/(log 2 log 3)

Taking square root gives us:
sqrt((log 6)^2/(log 2 log 3)) = log 6 / sqrt(log 2 log 3)

This matches exactly with the simplified form of the ground truth answer. Therefore, the two expressions are equivalent.
