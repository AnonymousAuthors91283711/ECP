Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n - 1) * (-1) + (if n % 2 = 0 then 0 else (-1)^((n - 1) / 2))
Proposed Answer: fun n => 2 - n
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for functions a and g that satisfy certain recurrence relations and initial conditions. The combined function (a + g) is what we're examining.

2. Ground Truth Answer:
   - Linear term: (n - 1) * (-1) = 1 - n
   - Periodic term: Alternates between 0 (for even n) and (-1)^k where k = (n-1)/2 (for odd n)

3. Proposed Answer: 2 - n (which is equivalent to 1 - n + 1)

Comparison:
- For n=1: 
  - GT: 0 + (-1)^0 = 1
  - Proposed: 1
- For n=2:
  - GT: -1 + 0 = -1
  - Proposed: 0
- For n=3:
  - GT: -2 + (-1)^1 = -3
  - Proposed: -1
- For n=4:
  - GT: -3 + 0 = -3
  - Proposed: -2

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth for n≥2. The periodic component in the ground truth makes the behavior more complex than the simple linear function proposed.
