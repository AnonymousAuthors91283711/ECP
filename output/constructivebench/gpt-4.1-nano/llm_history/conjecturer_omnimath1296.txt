Given the sum structure and the pattern observed in enumerations, the maximum sum s occurs when n(i) is set to produce summation involving the largest coefficients. The sum involves sequences defining relationships to the sequence pattern. Based on analysis, the maximum sum is achieved when n(i) are linear sequences leading to a quadratic sum pattern. The sum is proportional to the cubic power of the limit involving indices 2 to 2003, scaled appropriately. The pattern indicates the answer is involving \(\frac{(2003-1)(2003)(2*2003-1)}{6}\).
