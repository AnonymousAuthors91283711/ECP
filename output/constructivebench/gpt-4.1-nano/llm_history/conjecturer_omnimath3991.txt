theorem omnimath3991 :
  ∃ (cake_price cupcake_price bagel_price : ℚ),
    (1*cake_price + 2*cupcake_price + 3*bagel_price = 3*cake_price + 1*bagel_price) ∧
    (3*cake_price + 1*bagel_price = 6*cupcake_price) ∧
    (2*cake_price + 2*bagel_price = omnimath3991_answer * cupcake_price) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The equations relate cake, cupcake, and bagel prices; solving yields a fixed value for the ratio involving cupcake_price and cake_price. The pattern suggests the answer is proportional to the ratio derived from the system, leading to the fixed rational value 1/2.

<<<1 / 2>>>
