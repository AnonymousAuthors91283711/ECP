Ground Truth Answer: 12
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. First, let's understand the problem:
   - Total = 4 + 5 + 7 = 16
   - The equation is: 2 * (4/16) = 4/(16 - k)
   - Simplified: 2 * (1/4) = 4/(16 - k) → 1/2 = 4/(16 - k)
   - Solving: 16 - k = 8 → k = 8

2. The ground truth answer is 12, which is incorrect based on this calculation.

3. The proposed answer is 2, which is also incorrect.

However, both answers are wrong for the same problem, but they are not equivalent to each other. The correct answer should be 8.

<<<False>>>
