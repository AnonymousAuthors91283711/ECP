Ground Truth Answer: 13/27
Proposed Answer:  73/162
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating a probability related to dice faces. There are 6 faces with values [2,3,4,5,6,7].

2. Total dots (totalDots) = 2+3+4+5+6+7 = 27

3. The probability calculation involves two parts:
   - First part sums (n-1)*(1/27) for odd faces [3,5,7] → (2+4+6)/27 = 12/27
   - Second part sums 1/(6*27) for each odd face → 3/(6*27) = 3/162 = 1/54

4. Total probability = 12/27 + 1/54 = (24/54 + 1/54) = 25/54 ≈ 0.46296

5. Ground truth answer is 13/27 ≈ 0.48148
6. Proposed answer is 73/162 ≈ 0.45062

The calculations show neither answer matches our derivation, but the ground truth (13/27) is closer to our calculation than the proposed answer (73/162). 

Since neither matches our calculation and they're not equivalent to each other:

<<<False>>>
