The pattern suggests that the gcd of such forms often relates to the combined factors depending on the exponents. Since 4^8 - 1 factorizes as (2^2)^8 - 1 and 8^12 - 1 as (2^3)^12 - 1, their gcd hinges on the common divisors of 2^{lcm(2*8, 3*12)} - 1, which simplifies to 2^{24} - 1. 

Thus, the answer should be \(2^{24} - 1\).
