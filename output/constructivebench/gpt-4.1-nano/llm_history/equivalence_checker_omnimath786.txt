Ground Truth Answer: ∅
Proposed Answer: {0, 1}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation can be rewritten using the property that exp(x * log 2) = 2^x, so it becomes:
   2^x + 2^(x³) = 2 * 2^(x²) which simplifies to 2^x + 2^(x³) = 2^(x² + 1)

2. The condition also requires that either 2^x ≠ 2^(x²) or 2^(x²) ≠ 2^(x³), which simplifies to x ≠ x² or x² ≠ x³

3. Let's test the proposed solutions:
   - For x=0: 2^0 + 2^0 = 1+1=2 and 2^(0+1)=2. The condition becomes 1≠1 or 1≠1 which is false. So x=0 doesn't satisfy the second part.
   - For x=1: 2^1 + 2^1 = 4 and 2^(1+1)=4. The condition becomes 2≠2 or 2≠2 which is false. So x=1 doesn't satisfy the second part.

4. The ground truth answer is the empty set, which is correct because while x=0 and x=1 satisfy the equation, they don't satisfy the inequality condition.
