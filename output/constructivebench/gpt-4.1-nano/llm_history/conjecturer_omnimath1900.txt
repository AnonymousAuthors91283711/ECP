The pattern suggests the sequence may be quadratic or exponential with p(2) = 0, p(3) = 1, and positivity at p(2). Given the recurrence, the minimal initial value at 2 satisfying the conditions is 0, possibly leading to zero sequence beyond initial terms, and respecting the non-existence statement involving a₁₀. Therefore, the least such x is 0.
