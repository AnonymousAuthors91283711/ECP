The constraints indicate each number is two-digit (10–99), digits are non-zero, and all digits are distinct among the four numbers with their sum equal to 221.

The only way to sum four two-digit numbers with all digits distinct and non-zero to 221 is for each number to have digits 9 and 8, such as 98 and 87, summing to 221: 98 + 87 + 36 + 0 (not valid), or similar combinations.

Considering that, and the pattern from enumeration, the final pattern-based sum is: 99 + 98 + 25 + 99.

However, under the constraints, digits are non-zero, and the sum is achieved when all four numbers are 99, 98, 25, and 49, totaling 221.

Therefore, an explicit closed form is the sum of the maximum 99, 98, and remaining numbers fit the sum.

**Final answer in Lean form:**

<<<98 + 99 + 24 + 50>>>
