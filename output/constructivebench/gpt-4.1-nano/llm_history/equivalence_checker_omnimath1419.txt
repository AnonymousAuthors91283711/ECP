Ground Truth Answer: 84
Proposed Answer: (2 ^ (2010 : ℕ)) % 100
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence (xₙ, yₙ) with initial conditions and recurrence relations.
2. The ground truth answer is 84, which is the last two digits of x₂₀₁₂.
3. The proposed answer suggests (2²⁰¹⁰) mod 100.

First, let's compute 2²⁰¹⁰ mod 100:
- Euler's theorem tells us φ(100) = 40, so 2⁴⁰ ≡ 1 mod 100
- 2010 mod 40 = 10
- So 2²⁰¹⁰ ≡ 2¹⁰ ≡ 1024 ≡ 24 mod 100

This gives 24, which doesn't match the ground truth 84. Moreover, there's no clear connection between the recursive sequence defined in the problem and powers of 2.
