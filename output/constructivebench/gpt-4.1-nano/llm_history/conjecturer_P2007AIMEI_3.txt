theorem P2007AIMEI_3 (b : ℝ) (hb : 0 < b) :
    let z := 9 + b * I
    (z^2).im = (z^3).im ↔ b = P2007AIMEI_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The imaginary part equality (z²).im = (z³).im simplifies to a quadratic in b, leading to b = 0 or b = 18. Since hb > 0, the solution is b = 18. Therefore, the answer is 18. 

<<<18>>>
