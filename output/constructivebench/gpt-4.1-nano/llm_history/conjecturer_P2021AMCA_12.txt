The roots are positive integers from the roots condition, and p = X^6 - 10X^5 + A*X^4 + B*X^3 + C*X^2 + D*X + 16. The sum of roots is 10 (from Vieta's formulas), and the roots sum to 10 with positive integers. The roots are all positive and sum to 10, so the roots are positive divisors of 10 summing to 10. The roots likely include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in some order. Sum of roots involving roots greater than 5 suggests roots are 1, 2, 3, summing to 6, which aligns with these constraints. The coefficient B is related to the sum of products of roots taken three at a time, which yields 10. Thus, B = 0.
