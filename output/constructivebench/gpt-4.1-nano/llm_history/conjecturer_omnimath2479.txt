The recurrence relation is f n = 3 f(n-1) - 2 f(n-2), with initial conditions inferred from the sequence pattern. For the sequence to satisfy f n ≥ 1 and reach the bound f 2010 ≤ 2^2012, the minimal solution occurs when initial values are smallest, i.e., f 1 = 1, f 2 = 1, leading to the sequence f n = (n-1) * 2^{n-2}. The sequence grows exponentially, and the maximum f at n=2010 is roughly linear times exponential, so minimal coverage is achieved with the smallest initial values. Therefore, the answer is 2^{2010}.
