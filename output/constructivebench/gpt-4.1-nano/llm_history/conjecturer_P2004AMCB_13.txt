abbrev P2004AMCB_13_answer : ℤ := sorry
theorem P2004AMCB_13 (c : ℝ) (hc : c ≠ 3/2) :
    let f := fun c => 3 / (2 * c - 3)
    let finv := fun c => (3 + 3 * c) / (2 * c)
    ∃ k l m n : ℤ, finv c * c * f c = (k * c + l) / (m * c + n) ∧ k * n^2 / (l * m) = P2004AMCB_13_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℤ
Given the structure, the key is to analyze the algebraic manipulations involving c, f, and finv, aiming for a simplified constant integer expression for P2004AMCB_13_answer. Based on the pattern, the answer involves combining parameters to produce a concrete integer independent of c, with appropriate conditions. The form suggests a ratio involving squares of n and m and linear combinations of parameters, leading to the simplified form.
