Based on the recurrence and initial conditions, the sequence resembles a quadratic pattern involving powers of two and linear terms. Observing the pattern, a closed form ties to powers of two scaled and shifted, particularly focusing on its value at input 1. Thus, the conjectured answer:

<<<2^12 * 3>>>
