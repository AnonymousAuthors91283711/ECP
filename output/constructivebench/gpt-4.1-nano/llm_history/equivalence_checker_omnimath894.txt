Ground Truth Answer: 1 / 2
Proposed Answer: 0
Let's analyze this problem carefully:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal rational number q such that for all integers r,s satisfying the inequalities 3r ≥ 2s-3 and 4s ≥ r+12, we have r/s ≥ q.

2. The ground truth answer is 1/2, which means the minimal ratio r/s satisfying both inequalities is 1/2.

3. The proposed answer is 0, which would imply that r/s can be arbitrarily close to 0 while still satisfying the inequalities.

4. Let's test if 0 satisfies the conditions:
   - For the first part: If we take r=0 and s=3, the inequalities become 0 ≥ 3 (false) and 12 ≥ 12 (true). This doesn't satisfy both inequalities.
   - For r=1 and s=4: 3 ≥ 5 (false) and 16 ≥ 13 (true) - again fails.
   - The smallest ratio that satisfies both inequalities is indeed 1/2 (achieved at r=3, s=6).

5. The proposed answer 0 is incorrect because:
   - There are no integer pairs (r,s) satisfying both inequalities where r/s approaches 0
   - The actual minimal ratio is higher (1/2)
