theorem P2009AMCA_7 (x n : ℕ) (hx : 3 * x - 8 ≠ 0) :
  (5 * x - 11) - (2 * x - 3) = (3 * x + 1) - (5 * x - 11) ∧
  2 * x - 3 + (n - 1) * (3 * x - 8) = 2009 ↔

Ground Truth Answer: fun x => (2009 - (2 * x - 3)) / (3 * x - 8) + 1
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℕ => (2006 + 2 * x) / (3 * x - 8)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves solving for n in the equation:
   2x - 3 + (n - 1)(3x - 8) = 2009

2. Solving for n:
   (n - 1)(3x - 8) = 2009 - (2x - 3)
   n - 1 = (2009 - (2x - 3))/(3x - 8)
   n = (2009 - (2x - 3))/(3x - 8) + 1

3. Simplifying the numerator:
   2009 - (2x - 3) = 2009 - 2x + 3 = 2012 - 2x

4. The ground truth answer is exactly this expression: (2012 - 2x)/(3x - 8) + 1

5. The proposed answer is: (2006 + 2x)/(3x - 8)

6. Comparing the two:
   - The denominators are identical (3x - 8)
   - The numerators are different: (2012 - 2x) vs (2006 + 2x)
   - The ground truth has a +1 outside the division, while the proposed answer doesn't

The proposed answer is incorrect both in the numerator and by missing the +1 term. The expressions are not equivalent.
