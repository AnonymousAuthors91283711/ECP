Ground Truth Answer: 20
Proposed Answer: 13
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest natural number s that can be expressed as a sum in a sequence following specific rules, where each term comes from a restricted set {1,2,4,5,6,9,10,11,13}.

2. The sequence has constraints:
   - f1 = f0 + f2
   - f3 = f2 + f4
   - f5 = f4 + f6
   - f7 = f6 + f8
   - All terms must be from the specified set
   - The function f must be injective (all terms distinct)

3. The ground truth answer is 20, which comes from the sequence: 5, 6, -1 (but -1 is invalid), wait no - let's think differently.

Actually, the maximum sum would occur when we maximize the values while satisfying all constraints. The proposed answer is 13, which seems too low compared to the ground truth of 20.

The correct maximum sequence appears to be: 13, -8 (invalid), wait no - this suggests the proposed answer of 13 might be incorrect since we can't make a valid sequence that sums to 13 while satisfying all constraints.

Given that the ground truth is 20 and the proposed answer is 13, which is significantly lower and doesn't match, the answers are not equivalent.
