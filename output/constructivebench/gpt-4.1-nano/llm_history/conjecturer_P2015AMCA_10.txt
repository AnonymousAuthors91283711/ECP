The equation \(x + y + xy = 80\) can be rewritten as \((x+1)(y+1)=81\). Given \(0< y< x\) and \((x+1)(y+1)=81\), the factors of 81 are considered, with (x+1) > (y+1) > 1, and co-prime factors (since prime factorization of 81 is \(3^4\)). The only pair satisfying the inequalities is \((x+1, y+1) = (81, 1+a)\), leading to \(x=80\) and \(y=0\) if \(a=0\) which contradicts \(y>0\). Covering all co-prime factors, the only satisfying pair is (27,3), leading to \(x=26\). So, the value of \(x\) should be 26.

<<<26>>>
