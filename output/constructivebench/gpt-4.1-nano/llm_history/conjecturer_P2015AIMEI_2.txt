The problem computes the probability that among 3 sleepers chosen from 9 people with 2 Mexicans, 3 Canadians, and 4 Americans, at least two are from the same country. The numerator counts pairs from the same country times the remaining choices, totaling 18, while the denominator is total 9 choose 3 = 84. The simplified ratio reduces to 3/14 with numerator 18 and denominator 84. The numerator and denominator are coprime.
