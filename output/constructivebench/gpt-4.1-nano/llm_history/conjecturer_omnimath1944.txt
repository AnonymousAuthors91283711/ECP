theorem omnimath1944 : 
  Fintype.card {f : Fin 5 → Fin 5 // 
    Bijective f ∧ 
    ∀ (i j : Fin 5), (i.val - j.val) ≥ 3 → f j < f i} = omnimath1944_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern indicates that the bijections are constrained by the condition involving the difference in inputs, effectively limiting permutations. For Fin 5, the permutations satisfying the condition effectively fix the first 3 elements and permute the last 2 freely, producing 2! permutations. Therefore, the answer is the factorial of 2.
