Given the conditions, the symmetric sum constraints suggest certain equalities among the variables. The key observations imply that the permutation σ rearranges indices so that the values satisfy symmetrical conditions, especially with the sums and squares. The constraints ensure a specific pattern among the values, leading to the conclusion that the set of functions is exactly those mapping i to a fixed permutation of the numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

The problem describes permutations σ of Fin 9 and involves conditions on the sums and squares of certain elements. Noticing that the sums and sums of squares are equal under permutations, this suggests that the values of f are precisely the images of the elements of {1, 2, ..., 9} under some permutation, i.e., f(i) = (σ i).val + 1.

The set `omnimath1667_answer` is therefore exactly the set of functions that can be expressed as the composition of some permutation σ with the successor map (i ↦ i + 1). 

Given this reasoning, the expression should state that f is obtained by fixing a permutation of `Fin 9` applied to the indices, then mapping each to its value + 1.

**Fixing the errors:**

- Remove "Given the conditions" text and replace it with a set comprehension.
- Use `∃ π : Equiv.Perm (Fin 9),` to express the existence of a permutation.
- For each i, f i = (π i).val + 1.
- Wrap the set comprehension in braces.

The goal is to define `omnimath1667_answer` as the set of all functions `f : Fin 9 → ℕ` that can be obtained by some permutation of the indices (Fin 9), followed by adding 1 to its value. The details about the sum and sum of squares conditions suggest the key property is just that `f` is a permutation of `1..9`, with each value exactly one element from `1..9`. 

Given that, the natural set corresponding to the given conditions is:

```lean
{f | ∃ π : Equiv.Perm (Fin 9), ∀ i, f i = (π i).val + 1}
```

This captures all functions that are image of the successor map composed with some permutation. The assertion about the sums and squares aligns with the fact that permutations preserve sums and sums of squares; hence, the defining property reduces to the existence of a permutation.

**Final answer:**

<<<{f | ∃ π : Equiv.Perm (Fin 9), ∀ i, f i = (π i).val + 1}>>>
