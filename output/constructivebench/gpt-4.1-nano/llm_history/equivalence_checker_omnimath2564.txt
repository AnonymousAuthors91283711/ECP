Ground Truth Answer: 405
Proposed Answer: 2297
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding two real numbers r (r1 and r2) that satisfy a common root condition for two quadratic equations, then computing their sum and expressing it as a reduced fraction a/b, and finally computing 100*a + b.

2. The ground truth answer is 405, which would correspond to a=4 and b=5 (since 100*4 + 5 = 405).

3. The proposed answer is 2297, which would correspond to a=22 and b=97 (since 100*22 + 97 = 2297).

4. The correct sum of roots r1 + r2 is indeed -5 + (-14/3) = -29/3, which would be represented as a=-29, b=3 (not reduced). However, the reduced form would be the same since 29 and 3 are coprime.

5. Neither 4/5 nor 22/97 equals -29/3, so both answers appear incorrect. However, the ground truth answer (405) is closer to what might be a typo (perhaps meant to be 2903 for a=29, b=3), while the proposed answer (2297) is completely different.
