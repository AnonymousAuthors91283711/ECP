  (hP : P = fun a b c d => a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ c > 0 ∧ d > 0 ∧ (Nat.gcd a c = 1 ∧ Nat.gcd b d = 1) ∧ (Nat.gcd a b ≠ 1 ∧ Nat.gcd b c ≠ 1 ∧ Nat.gcd c d ≠ 1 ∧ Nat.gcd d a ≠ 1)) :
  IsLeast {s | ∃ a b c d : ℕ, P a b c d ∧ s = a + b + c + d} omnimath2065_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The minimal sum s occurs when all variables are minimal positive integers satisfying the gcd conditions: a=1, b=1, c=1, d=1, but gcd(a,c)=1 and gcd(b,d)=1 are trivially satisfied. The gcd conditions among pairs exclude 1 for some pairs, so the minimals are a=1, c=1 with gcd(a,c)=1, but b and d need to satisfy that gcd b d ≠ 1 but both greater than 0. The minimal configuration that satisfies all gcd constraints is with a=b=c=d=2, yielding sum 8, as smaller values violate gcd conditions. Therefore, the least sum s is 8.
