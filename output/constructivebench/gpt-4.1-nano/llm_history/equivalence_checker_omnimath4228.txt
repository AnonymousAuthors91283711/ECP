Ground Truth Answer: {1}
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | n % 2 = 1}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for which natural numbers n there exists an integer x such that x^n + (2 + x)^n + (2 - x)^n = 0.

2. Ground truth answer is {1}, meaning only n=1 satisfies the condition.

3. Proposed answer is all odd natural numbers ({n : ℕ | n % 2 = 1}).

Let's test the equation for n=1:
x + (2 + x) + (2 - x) = x + 2 + x + 2 - x = x + 4 = 0 ⇒ x = -4. So n=1 works.

For n=3:
Let's try x=0: 0 + 8 + 8 = 16 ≠ 0
x=1: 1 + 27 + 1 = 29 ≠ 0
x=-1: -1 + 1 + 27 = 27 ≠ 0
x=2: 8 + 64 + 0 = 72 ≠ 0
x=-2: -8 + 0 + 64 = 56 ≠ 0
It appears no integer x satisfies the equation for n=3.

The proposed answer claims all odd n work, but we've found n=3 doesn't work. Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect.
