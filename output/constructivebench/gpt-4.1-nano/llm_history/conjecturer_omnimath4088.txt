Based on the pattern of constrained sums and minimum bounds, the maximum occurs when x, y, z are at their minimums satisfying the sum. Adjusting x, y, z to minimize their lower bounds and maximize the product suggests using boundary values \(x=20\), \(y=40\), and the remaining to \(z\). The maximum product concentrates the remaining sum into \(z\) since \(z\) can be large. Final answer: \(20 \times 40 \times (2015 - 20 - 40)\).

In lean syntax, the answer is:

<<<20 * 40 * (2015 - 20 - 40)>>>
