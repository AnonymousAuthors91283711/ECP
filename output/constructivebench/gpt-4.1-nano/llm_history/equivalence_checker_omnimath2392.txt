theorem omnimath2392 :
  (∑ d in Finset.Icc 1 2012, Nat.floor (2012 / d) = omnimath2392_answer) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 15612
Proposed Answer: 2012 + 503 * 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers carefully.

The problem is asking for the sum of floor(2012/d) for all divisors d from 1 to 2012. The ground truth answer is 15612.

The proposed answer breaks this down as:
2012 (for d=1) + 503*2 (which would be 1006)

But 2012 + 1006 = 3018, which is much smaller than 15612. The proposed answer is missing many terms from the sum.

The correct approach would need to account for all divisors and their contributions to the sum, not just these two components. The proposed answer is significantly incomplete.
