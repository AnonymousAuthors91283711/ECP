Ground Truth Answer: 202
Proposed Answer: 403
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a function f(n) = C(n+4,4) - (if n≥2 then C(n+3,3) else 0)
2. It asks to count how many numbers k between 1 and 2014 satisfy f(k) ≡ 1 mod 10
3. The ground truth answer is 202
4. The proposed answer is 403

Looking at the relationship between these numbers:
- 403 is exactly double 202 (rounded up)
- This suggests the proposed answer might be counting something twice or missing a division by 2
- The ground truth answer 202 is more precise and likely correct

The proposed answer of 403 is incorrect as it doesn't match the verified ground truth. The correct count should be 202.

<<<False>>>
