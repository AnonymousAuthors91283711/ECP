Given the functional equation and boundary condition, the polynomial likely satisfies a rational recurrence resembling a scaled quadratic form. Analyzing the pattern, the answer appears to be a quadratic in -1. The pattern suggests the final answer is a constant value independent of P.

The conjectured closed form based on pattern and structure:

<<<-8/7>>>

This is consistent with the nature of the problem, matching the observed pattern in enumerated solutions.
