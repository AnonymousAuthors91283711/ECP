  IsLeast {n : ℕ | n ≤ 17 ∧ n * 6 + 8 * 5 / 2 ≥ 100} P2004AMCA_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The set condition is n*6 + 8*5/2 ≥ 100, which simplifies to n*6 + 20 ≥ 100, or n*6 ≥ 80, n ≥ 80/6 ≈ 13.33. The smallest integer satisfying this is 14, with n ≤ 17. Thus, minimal n is 14.
