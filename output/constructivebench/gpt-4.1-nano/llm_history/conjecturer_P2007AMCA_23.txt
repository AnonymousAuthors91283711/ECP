The given conditions imply points A, B, C form a certain geometric configuration with specified log-based relationships and distances. From the pattern in the enumerated guesses, the value of a that satisfies these relationships aligns with the given distances and slopes. Noticing the distances and the relation to the logs, the constant a that satisfies the constraints appears to be 4, consistent with the structure of the problem.
