def countArrangements : ℕ := 
  let n := 8

  (fingers + k - 1).choose k * (k.factorial) * (n ^ k)

theorem P2000AIMEII_5 :
  let digits := (countArrangements).digits 10
  digits.reverse.take 3 = P2000AIMEII_5_answer.digits 10 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern and combinatorial reasoning involving arrangements with repetitions, the value should be 2592000, as the arrangements correspond to choosing and permuting digits with repetitions. 

<<<2592000>>>
