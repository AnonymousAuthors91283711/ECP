abbrev omnimath1336_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath1336 :
    (∑' a : Set.Ici 1, ∑' b : Set.Ici a.1, ∑' c : Set.Ici b.1, 1 / (2 ^ a.1 * 3 ^ b.1 * 5 ^ c.1) = omnimath1336_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Given the pattern of the exponential sums over increasingly nested intervals, the sum resembles a triple product of geometric series:

Sum over a ≥ 1: 1 / 2^a = 1/2
Sum over b ≥ a: 1 / 3^b = 1/3^a / (1 - 1/3)
Sum over c ≥ b: 1 / 5^c = 1/5^b / (1 - 1/5)

Multiplying these sums:
(1/2) * (1/3^a / (1 - 1/3)) * (1/5^b / (1 - 1/5))

Computed as:
1/2 * (1/3^a * 3/2) * (1/5^b * 5/4)

Simplifies to:
(1/2) * (1/3^a * 3/2) * (1/5^b * 5/4) for the variables, but their summation over nested intervals yields:

Final sum as a product of sums:
(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/4) = 1/8

Thus, inspired by the geometric series structure:

<<<(1:ℚ)/8>>>
