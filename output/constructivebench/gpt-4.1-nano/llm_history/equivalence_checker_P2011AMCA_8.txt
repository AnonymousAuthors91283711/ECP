Ground Truth Answer: 25
Proposed Answer: 10
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. We have a system of equations with 8 variables (A-H) and 6 equations plus one known value (C=5).

2. Starting from the given information:
   - From h1: A + B + 5 = 30 ⇒ A + B = 25
   - From h2: B + 5 + D = 30 ⇒ B + D = 25 ⇒ D = 25 - B
   - From h3: 5 + D + E = 30 ⇒ D + E = 25 ⇒ E = 25 - D = B (since D = 25 - B)
   - From h4: D + E + F = 30 ⇒ (25 - B) + B + F = 30 ⇒ 25 + F = 30 ⇒ F = 5
   - From h5: E + F + G = 30 ⇒ B + 5 + G = 30 ⇒ G = 25 - B
   - From h6: F + G + H = 30 ⇒ 5 + (25 - B) + H = 30 ⇒ 30 - B + H = 30 ⇒ H = B

3. Now we can express A + H:
   - From A + B = 25 and H = B ⇒ A + H = A + B = 25

The ground truth answer is 25, while the proposed answer is 10. These are clearly different.
