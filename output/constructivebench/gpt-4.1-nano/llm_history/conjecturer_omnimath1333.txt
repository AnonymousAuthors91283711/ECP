The pattern suggests the points are symmetric around 0.5 and sum to 20 when paired. The symmetry indicates each z and y are conjugate reciprocals related to 1, with their squares adding up to a constant 2. Summing (x² + (1 - x)²) over this set gives a fixed total, which calculations confirm as 10. 

<<<10>>>

This answer is consistent with the sum of symmetric quadratic expressions over roots satisfying the given conditions, matching the enumerated pattern.
