Ground Truth Answer: 163/256
Proposed Answer:  1/2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating a sum of binomial probabilities where k ≥ 4 in a binomial distribution with n=8 trials and p=1/2 probability of success.

2. The ground truth answer 163/256 is correct because:
   - It's the sum of probabilities for k=4 to k=8 in B(8, 0.5)
   - Calculated as (C(8,4) + C(8,5) + C(8,6) + C(8,7) + C(8,8))/256
   - Which equals (70 + 56 + 28 + 8 + 1)/256 = 163/256

3. The proposed answer 1/2 is incorrect because:
   - It's exactly half of the correct value
   - It doesn't match the actual calculation
   - There's no mathematical justification for this result in this context

The answers are not equivalent.
