The condition involves the number of integers N > 2017 with the count of numbers whose leading digit is 1, scaled and related linearly to N. 

Based on the pattern, leading digits count grow approximately proportionally to N/9, with the condition involving a factor of 2/5 of N. To satisfy this, N should be just above 2017, near a multiple of 9 adjusted to the pattern.

Final answer:
<<<(2018 + 4 * 9 - (2018 - 2017) % 9)>>>

This corresponds to the minimal N > 2017 where the leading digit count condition holds approximately at the expected ratio.
