The inequality |2 * x| ≤ 7 * π implies x ∈ [ - (7π)/2 , (7π)/2 ]. Since ℤ is discrete, the exact count of integers in this interval is the integer part of (7π)/2 plus 1. The value of π is approximately 3.14159, so (7 * π)/2 ≈ 10.9956, thus counting integers from -10 to 10 inclusive. The total integers are 21: from -10 up to 10.
