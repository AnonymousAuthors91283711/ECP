abbrev omnimath3638_answer : ℕ → ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3638 (n : ℕ) :
  ∑ k in Finset.range (n + 1), (10^k - 1)/9 = omnimath3638_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (10^(n+1) - 10 - 9 * n) / 81
Proposed Answer: fun n => (10^(n+1) - (n + 1) - 1 : ℚ) / 9
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem: We're asked to find a closed-form expression for the sum ∑_{k=0}^n (10^k - 1)/9.

Ground Truth Answer: (10^(n+1) - 10 - 9n)/81

Proposed Answer: (10^(n+1) - (n + 1) - 1)/9

Let's verify the ground truth:
The sum can be written as (1/9)(∑10^k - ∑1) = (1/9)((10^{n+1}-1)/9 - (n+1))
= (10^{n+1}-1 -9(n+1))/81 = (10^{n+1}-10-9n)/81 (after combining constants)

Now let's expand the proposed answer:
(10^{n+1} - n - 1 - 1)/9 = (10^{n+1} - n - 2)/9

This is clearly different from the ground truth. The proposed answer is missing the division by 9 in the denominator and has incorrect terms in the numerator.

<<<False>>>
