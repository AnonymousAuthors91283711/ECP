  {m : ℕ | m > 0 ∧ (∃ k ≥ 4, ∃ p : Fin k → ℕ, (∀ i : Fin k, Nat.Prime (p i)) ∧ (∏ i : Fin k, p i) = m^2 - m + 11)}

The pattern from enumeration suggests the minimal m is achieved at m=1, making the expression m^2 - m + 11 = 11, which factors as 11 (prime). Since 11 is prime, and the condition involves prime tuple products equaling m^2 - m + 11, for m=1, the product is 11, which is prime—one prime, and primes ≥4 are not relevant unless the product is of at least four terms. 

Therefore, the least positive m satisfying the conditions is 1.
