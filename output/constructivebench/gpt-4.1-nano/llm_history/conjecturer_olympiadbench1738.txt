      {n | ∃ f : Fin n → Polynomial ℚ,
        ∀ x : ℚ, x ^ 2 + 7 = ∑ i : Fin n, (f i).eval x ^ 2}
      olympiadbench1738_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem involves minimal n such that a quadratic polynomial form exists for sum over Fin n. The enumeration hints at the minimal n = 3, as three terms can produce a quadratic polynomial sum. Therefore, the answer is 3.
