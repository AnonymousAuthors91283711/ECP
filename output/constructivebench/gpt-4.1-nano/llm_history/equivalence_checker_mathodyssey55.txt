Ground Truth Answer: 35
Proposed Answer: (36 + 108 + 99)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two quadratic functions f and g in the form x² + ax + b and x² + cx + d respectively.
2. We're given specific conditions about these functions at x=6, x=-1, and x=1.
3. The ground truth answer is simply 35.
4. The proposed answer is (36 + 108 + 99) which equals 243.

The proposed answer (243) is clearly different from the ground truth answer (35). There's no mathematical equivalence between these two values. The proposed answer appears to be a completely different calculation unrelated to the problem's conditions.
