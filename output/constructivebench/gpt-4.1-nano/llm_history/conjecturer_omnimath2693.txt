The number N must be between 400 and 600, odd, divisible by 5 and 11, with digit sum as specified. Since divisible by 11 and odd, N ends with 5 or 15, 25, etc. Check numbers like 455, 495, 505, 545, 585. Sum of digits matches: 455 (4+5+5=14), 495 (4+9+5=18), 505 (5+0+5=10), 545 (5+4+5=14), 585 (5+8+5=18). Only 495 and 585 are within 400–600, odd, divisible by 5 and 11, and satisfy the sum constraints. Final digit sum pattern: For N=495 (sum=18), N=585 (sum=18). Choose N=495 or N=585.

Answer: <<<495>>>
