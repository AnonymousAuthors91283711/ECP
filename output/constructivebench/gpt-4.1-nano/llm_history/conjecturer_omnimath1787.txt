theorem omnimath1787 :
    ∑' n : Set.Ici 2009, 1 / (choose n 2009) = omnimath1787_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Since the summation involves inverse binomial coefficients starting from 2009, the pattern suggests that the sum equals the reciprocal of the binomial coefficient for the lower bound, i.e., \( \frac{1}{\binom{2009}{2009}} = 1 \). The common telescoping property indicates the sum simplifies to 1.
