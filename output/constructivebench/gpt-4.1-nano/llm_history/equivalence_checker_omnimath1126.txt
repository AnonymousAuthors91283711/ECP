Ground Truth Answer: 3 / 5
Proposed Answer: (2 / 3 : ℝ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find the value of p (between 0 and 1) that makes the two binomial probability expressions equal.

2. Let's compute both sides:
   - Left side: choose(4,2) * p² * (1-p)² = 6 * p² * (1-p)²
   - Right side: choose(4,3) * p³ * (1-p) = 4 * p³ * (1-p)

3. Setting them equal:
   6p²(1-p)² = 4p³(1-p)
   Simplifying (assuming p ≠ 0 and p ≠ 1):
   6(1-p) = 4p
   6 - 6p = 4p
   6 = 10p
   p = 6/10 = 3/5

4. The ground truth answer is 3/5 (0.6), while the proposed answer is 2/3 (≈0.666...).

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the equation. The correct solution is indeed 3/5.
