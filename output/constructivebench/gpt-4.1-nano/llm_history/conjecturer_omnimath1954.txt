The problem examines the set of all integers D such that for all real a,b within (-1/4, 1/4), the inequality |a^2 - D * b^2| < 1 holds. Given the pattern and the bounds involved, a constant D that satisfies the condition for the maximum possible a,b is D=1, since in such small intervals, the quadratic differences stay bounded. 

Thus, the total count of such D is just 1.
