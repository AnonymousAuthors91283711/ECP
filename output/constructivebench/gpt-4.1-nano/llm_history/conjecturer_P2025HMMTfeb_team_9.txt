Based on structure and pattern, the set characterizes primes with specific modular periodicity; it appears to be all primes p where certain modular equations hold, hinting at a divisibility criterion involving p. Since the given functions are periodic mod p and satisfy a condition involving f(x+f(x)), the set likely includes all primes p satisfying p ∣ (f(x+f(x))-x). The simplest such prime set is the set of all primes p where p divides some integer related to f, simplifying to p itself.
