noncomputable abbrev omnimath990_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath990 (a : ℝ) (ha : 1 < a) :
  HasSum (fun i : ℕ => (a * i) / (a^i)) (omnimath990_answer a) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
The series is geometric with ratio \( \frac{1}{a} \) and first term \( \frac{a}{a} = 1 \), summing to \( \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{a}} = \frac{a}{a - 1} \).  
Final answer: <<<fun a : ℝ => a / (a - 1)>>>, valid for \( a > 1 \).
