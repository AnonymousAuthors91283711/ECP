Ground Truth Answer: 168
Proposed Answer:  256 + 2^8 + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the sum of all divisors d (where 10 ≤ d ≤ 99) of 2³² - 1.

2. First, we factorize 2³² - 1:
   2³² - 1 = (2¹⁶ + 1)(2⁸ + 1)(2⁴ + 1)(2² + 1)(2¹ + 1)
   This gives us the prime factorization: 3 × 5 × 17 × 257 × 65537

3. The divisors between 10 and 99 would be combinations of these factors:
   - 15 (3×5)
   - 17
   - 51 (3×17)
   - 85 (5×17)
   Sum: 15 + 17 + 51 + 85 = 168

4. The proposed answer is 256 + 2⁸ + 1 = 256 + 256 + 1 = 513, which is incorrect.

5. The ground truth answer is 168, which matches our calculation.
