Given the combinatorial nature and pattern observed, the sum modulo (n+1) relates to binomial coefficients raised to the kth power. Patterns suggest that the sum's divisibility depends on whether k is even, to ensure symmetry and cancellation. Hence, the final set likely includes all even integers; odd k do not guarantee divisibility.
