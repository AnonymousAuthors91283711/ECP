Given the recurrence F(n+2) = F(n+1) + F(n) with initial F(0)=0 and F(1)=1, F is the Fibonacci sequence. The question asks for the size of the set of Fibonacci numbers ≤ 100 divisible by 13.

Fibonacci numbers divisible by 13 occur at regular positions modulo 13. The pattern repeats every 28 terms, with Fibonacci numbers divisible by 13 at indices n where n mod 28 is 0 or 26, in the range 0 to 100 inclusive—giving 4 such n: 0, 26, 28, and 52.

Answer: 4
