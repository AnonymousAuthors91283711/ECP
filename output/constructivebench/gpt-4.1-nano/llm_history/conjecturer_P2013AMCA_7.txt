theorem P2013AMCA_7 :
  ∃ (S : ℕ → ℕ), (∀ n ≥ 3, S n = S (n-1) + S (n-2)) ∧ S 9 = 110 ∧ S 7 = 42 ∧ S 4 = P2013AMCA_7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the recursive relation \( S(n) = S(n-1) + S(n-2) \) with initial conditions \( S(4) \), \( S(7) \), and \( S(9) \), it resembles a Fibonacci-like sequence. Using the given values, we can determine \( S(4) \) in terms of Fibonacci numbers, which satisfy \( F_{k} = F_{k-1} + F_{k-2} \) with \( F_1=1, F_2=1 \). Since \( S(7)=42 \) and \( S(9)=110 \), solving yields \( S(n) = 7 \times F_{n-3} \). Thus, \( P2013AMCA_7_answer = 7 \times F_1 = 7 \times 1 = 7 \).
