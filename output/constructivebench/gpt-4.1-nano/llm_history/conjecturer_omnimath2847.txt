theorem omnimath2847 (A B C D : ℤ) (h₁ : A < B ∧ B < C ∧ C < D) 
  (h₂ : (B - A : ℚ) / (C - A) = 1 / 5) 
  (h₃ : (C - B : ℚ) / (D - C) = 2 / 1) : 
  (B - A : ℚ) / (D - C) = omnimath2847_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The pattern from enumerated answers suggests combining the ratios: (B - A)/(C - A) = 1/5 and (C - B)/(D - C) = 2/1. The overall ratio (B - A)/(D - C) relates directly to these components, leading to (B - A)/(D - C) = (B - A)/(C - A) + (C - B)/(D - C) = 1/5 + 2/1 = (1 + 10)/5 = 11/5. 

Answer:
<<<(11 / 5)>>>
