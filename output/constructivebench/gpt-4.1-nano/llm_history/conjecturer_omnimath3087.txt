noncomputable abbrev omnimath3087_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3087 :
  (fun x => 4 * x / (x + 2 * x)) 2021 = omnimath3087_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The expression simplifies to \( \frac{4x}{3x} = \frac{4}{3} \). So, the answer is a constant rational number \( \frac{4}{3} \).
