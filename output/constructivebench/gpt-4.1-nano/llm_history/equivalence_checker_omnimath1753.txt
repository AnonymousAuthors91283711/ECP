Ground Truth Answer: fun u c => ((u + c) / 2, (u - c)^2 / (4 * u))
Proposed Answer: fun u c => (u / 2, (u / 2 - c) / 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find the maximum of the function f(p) = (p - c)(1 - p/u) on the interval [c, u], and return both the maximizing p and the maximum value.

2. The ground truth answer:
   - p = (u + c)/2
   - r = (u - c)²/(4u)
   This is correct as it finds the vertex of the quadratic function.

3. The proposed answer:
   - p = u/2
   - r = (u/2 - c)/2
   This is incorrect because:
   - The maximizing p should depend on both u and c, not just u
   - The maximum value calculation is completely wrong

The proposed answer would only be correct when c = 0, but the problem states c can be any value in [0, u].
