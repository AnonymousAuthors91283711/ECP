Ground Truth Answer: 1006
Proposed Answer: 0
Let's analyze this problem carefully:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence a(n) where:
   - a(0) = 0
   - a(1) = 1
   - a(n+1) = (a(n) + (n+1)) mod 2012

2. We're asked to compute a(2012) mod 2012.

3. The ground truth answer is 1006, while the proposed answer is 0.

4. Let's compute some initial terms to see the pattern:
   - a(0) = 0
   - a(1) = 1
   - a(2) = (1 + 2) mod 2012 = 3
   - a(3) = (3 + 3) mod 2012 = 6
   - a(4) = (6 + 4) mod 2012 = 10
   - ... 
   - This appears to be building triangular numbers mod 2012.

5. The closed form for a(n) is the nth triangular number T(n) = n(n+1)/2 mod 2012.

6. For n=2012:
   T(2012) = 2012×2013/2 = 1006×2013 mod 2012
   Since 2012 ≡ 0 mod 2012, this becomes 1006×1 ≡ 1006 mod 2012.

The proposed answer (0) is incorrect as it doesn't match the correct computation (1006).
