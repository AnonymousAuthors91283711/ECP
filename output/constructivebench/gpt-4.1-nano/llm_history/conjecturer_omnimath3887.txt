theorem omnimath3887
: IsLeast {α : ℝ | α > 0 ∧ ∀ x > 0, ∀ y > 0, (x + y) / 2 ≥ α * Real.sqrt (x * y) + (1 - α) * Real.sqrt ((x ^ 2 + y ^ 2) / 2)} omnimath3887_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the minimum value occurs at the equality case when x=y, leading to α=1/2, balancing the geometric and arithmetic mean terms.  
Thus, the answer is the equality case value at x=y, which simplifies to 1/2.  

<<<1/2>>>
