The pattern relates to the values of f at specific points, and the functional equation suggests an additive or affine structure with possible increments. Given f(2)=0, f(3)>0, and f(9999)=3333, along with the additive relation, the pattern aligns with a linear function with slope 1/3. 

Since f(2)=0 ⇒ f(2)= (2−2) * c = 0, then c=0, and with f(9999)=3333, so f(n)= n/3. 

Thus, f(1982)=1982/3.

Then the answer is:

<<<1982 / 3>>>
