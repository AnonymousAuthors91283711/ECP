The minimal sum s corresponds to selecting the smallest primes covering all digits {1,...,9} without digit overlap. These primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, and possibly 11, but since 11's digits are {1,1} and would overlap with 1, it is not included. The set {2,3,5,7} covers all digits 1-9 without repeats, summing to 17. The minimal sum s is thus 17.
