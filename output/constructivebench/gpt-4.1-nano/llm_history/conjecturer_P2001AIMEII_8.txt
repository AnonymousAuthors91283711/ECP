The function f satisfies f(x) = 1 - |x - 2| on [1,3], with self-similarity f(3x)=3f(x). To satisfy f(2001) = f(3*667+2), solutions resemble piecewise linear functions with periodicity. The minimal x ≥ 0 with these properties is at x=2, where the minimum of the absolute value function is achieved. Therefore, the least such x is 2.
