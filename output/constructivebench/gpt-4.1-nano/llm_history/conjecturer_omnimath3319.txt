theorem omnimath3319 : 
  ∏ k ∈ Finset.range 2004, sin (2 * π * (k + 1) / 4009) = omnimath3319_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the product involves roots of unity with symmetry around the circle, resulting in a product that evaluates to 1, except when a factor equals zero. Since sin(2π (k+1)/4009) is zero only when (k+1) is multiple of 2004, which doesn't occur for k ∈ [0,2003], all factors are non-zero, and the product evaluates to 1.
