Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0, 0)}
Proposed Answer: { (a, b, c) | a = 0 } ∪ { (a, b, c) | b = 0 } ∪ { (a, b, c) | c = 0 }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all integer triples (a,b,c) such that a² + b² + c² = a²b².

2. Ground truth answer is just {(0,0,0)} - meaning only the zero triple satisfies the equation.

3. Proposed answer claims the solution is all triples where at least one coordinate is zero.

Testing the proposed answer:
- (0,1,1): 0+1+1=2 ≠ 0*1*1=0 → Doesn't satisfy equation but is in proposed answer
- (1,0,1): Similar issue
- (0,0,0): Only this case works

The proposed answer includes many invalid solutions while the ground truth correctly identifies only (0,0,0) works.

<<<False>>>
