theorem P2002AIMEI_1 :
  IsLeast {k : ℕ | ∃ m n : ℕ, Nat.Coprime m n ∧ k = m + n ∧
    (m / n : ℚ) = (26^3 * 10 + 10^3 * 26 - 26 * 10) / (26^3 * 10^3 : ℚ)} P2002AIMEI_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The expression involves the sum \(m + n\) where \(m/n\) equals a specific rational. The rational simplifies to \(\frac{26^3 \cdot 10 + 10^3 \cdot 26 - 26 \cdot 10}{26^3 \cdot 10^3}\). Recognizing the pattern, the minimal \(k\) satisfying the conditions is obtained when \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime and the ratio is simplified. The minimal sum of coprime \(m, n\) representing the ratio is \(\boxed{37}\), corresponding to the simplified form.
