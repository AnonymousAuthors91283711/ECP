The pattern suggests the minimal k must ensure the differences 5, 7, 12 cannot be between two points of the set. For such differences, the minimal k that guarantees the set's property (disjointness) without overlap occurs at 13, covering the largest difference 12 but excluding 5 and 7 overlaps. 

Hence, the smallest such k is 13.
