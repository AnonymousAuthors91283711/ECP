The problem asks for a formula expressing the maximum possible value of the sequence `omnimath164_answer n`, ensuring a set of the form {a, a+d, a+2d} exists within the sorted subset `s`.

Given the pattern of the set with exactly 3 equally spaced points, the maximal value is achieved when choosing the largest possible `a + 2d`, with the constraint that `a + 2d` is less than or equal to the largest element in `s`. Since the sequence `s.sort` is strictly increasing, the maximum value occurs when `a` is just less than `s.max` and `d` is as large as possible, i.e., close to `(s.max - a)/2`.

Considering the pattern in the enumerated answers, the closed form that generalizes this maximization is:

`2 * s.max - 2`

which accounts for the largest such triple fitting within `s`, assuming the largest element is `s.max`.

In Lean, considering `n`, the size of `s`, and that the maximum element `s.max` is at most `n`, we can approximate the answer by:

```lean
fun n => 2 * n - 2
```

since the maximum element in the sorted set `s` can be at most `n`. This closes the form without existential quantifiers.

<<<fun n => 2 * n - 2>>>
