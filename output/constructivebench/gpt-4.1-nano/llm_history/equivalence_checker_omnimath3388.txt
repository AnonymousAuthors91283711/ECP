Ground Truth Answer: (5/4, 1/2, 1/4)
Proposed Answer: (0, 1, 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a system of 3 equations with 3 variables (p, q, r):
   - p + 3q + r = 3
   - p + 2q + 3r = 3
   - p + q + r = 2

2. The ground truth answer is (5/4, 1/2, 1/4)

3. The proposed answer is (0, 1, 1)

Let's test the proposed answer in the equations:
1. 0 + 3*1 + 1 = 4 ≠ 3 (fails first equation)
2. 0 + 2*1 + 3*1 = 5 ≠ 3 (fails second equation)
3. 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 (only this one is correct)

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the system of equations, while the ground truth does. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
