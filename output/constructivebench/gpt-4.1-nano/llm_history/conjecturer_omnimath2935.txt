  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 1 / 2 < n / 9} omnimath2935_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the set {n : ℕ | 1/2 < n/9}, solving 1/2 < n/9 yields n > 4.5, so the smallest integer n satisfying the inequality is 5. The answer is 5, which can be expressed in Lean as:

<<<5>>>
