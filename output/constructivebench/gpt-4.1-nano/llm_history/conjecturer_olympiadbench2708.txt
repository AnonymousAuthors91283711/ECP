Given the divisibility, minimality, and structural constraints, the answer likely depends on the minimal y satisfying the uniform divisibility condition related to the cube factorization of 1584 * x. Based on the enumeration, y equals the minimal positive y such that 1584 * x divides x * y, which simplifies to y being proportional to 1584. 

Thus, the final answer is:

<<<1584>>>
