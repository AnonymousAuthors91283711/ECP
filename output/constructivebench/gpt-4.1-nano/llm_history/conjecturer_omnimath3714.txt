The equation simplifies to a symmetric quadratic form, ultimately relating to the sum of squares. The minimal value of \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\) satisfying the equation when \(a, b, c\) are real is achieved at the symmetric point where all variables are equal. By symmetry and minimality considerations, set \(a = b = c\), leading to the quadratic equation \(3a^2 + 3a = 3a^2 + 3a = 0\). The minimal sum of squares is then \(a = 0\), giving \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 0\).
