    b = P2012AMCA_6_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Since a + b = 12 and a + c = 17, subtracting yields c - b = 5. Also, b + c = 19. Combining these: (b + c) = 19 and c = b + 5, substitute to get b + (b + 5) = 19 → 2b + 5 = 19 → 2b = 14 → b = 7. So, final answer: 7.
