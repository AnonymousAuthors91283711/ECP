Since log x > 0 and (log x)^(log (log x)) = 10000, then log x = 10, leading to x = e^10. The pattern suggests the answer set contains only this value.

The current proposed answer `{e^10}` encounters an error because `e` is not recognized as an identifier in Lean's `Mathlib`. In Lean, the constant representing Euler's number `e` is `Real.exp 1`. To define a singleton set containing `e^10`, we should use `Real.exp 10` instead of `e^10`, and to create a set with a single element, we can write `{Real.exp 10}`.

Given the problem involves solving `(log x)^(log (log x)) = 10000` for `x > 0`, a natural solution occurs when `log x = 10`. Then, `x = exp 10`. Check the condition:

`(log x)^(log (log x)) = 10^10 = 10000`? No, because `10^10 = 10^10`, which is much larger than 10000, so this suggests a different solution.

Notice that:

`(log x)^(log (log x)) = 10000`.

Set `t = log x`. Then,

`t^{log t} = 10000`.

We seek `t > 0`, satisfying `t^{log t} = 10000`.

Taking `log` of both sides:

`log t * log t = log 10000`.

Since `log 10000 = log (10^4) = 4 * log 10`. Because `log 10` in Lean is standard, we can denote this explicitly.

Thus, ` (log t)^2 = 4 * log 10`.

Therefore,

`log t = ± sqrt(4 * log 10)`.

But since `t > 0` and `log t` is real, the principal value is positive, so

`log t = sqrt(4 * log 10) = 2 * sqrt(log 10)`.

Correspondingly,

`t = exp (2 * sqrt(log 10))`.

Now, since `t = log x`,

`log x = t = exp (2 * sqrt(log 10))`.

Hence,

`x = exp (exp (2 * sqrt(log 10)))`.

Now, the only candidate solution is at this value, because the previous attempt with `log x = 10` does not fit the equation.

Given the equation's form, the solutions are in fact this \( x = \exp (\exp (2 \sqrt{\log 10})) \).

Alternatively, because the equation involves a repeated logarithm and a power, multiple solutions could exist, but the principal one is given by this value.

In terms of representation in Lean, we then define the singleton set containing `exp (exp (2 * sqrt (log 10)))`.

**Therefore, the correct answer is:**

```lean
{Real.exp (Real.exp (2 * Real.sqrt (Real.log 10)))}
```
