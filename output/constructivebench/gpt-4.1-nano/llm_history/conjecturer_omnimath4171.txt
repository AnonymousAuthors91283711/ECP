abbrev omnimath4171_answer : Set (ℤ × ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath4171 (x y : ℤ) : 
    (x^7 - 1) / (x - 1) = y^5 - 1 ↔ (x, y) ∈ omnimath4171_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ)
The pattern suggests the expression simplifies when x is a 5th power, with the key leading to (x,y) = ((z^5), z).  
Final answer: <<< { (x, y) | ∃ z : ℤ, x = z^5 ∧ y = z } >>>
