The question asks for the greatest distance \(d\) for which there exist integers \(m<n\) with \(n - m = d\), such that the interval \([m, n)\) contains more multiples of 2021 than multiples of 2000. The critical point is where counts of multiples switch relative to this interval. For large \(m, n\), the counts depend on the floors of \(n/m\) over these divisible numbers, and the maximum difference occurs around the least common multiple of 2000 and 2021. Since \(\operatorname{lcm}(2000, 2021) = 2000 \times 2021\), the greatest such \(d\) should be this value to maximize the difference. 

Thus, the answer is:

<<<(2000 * 2021)>>>
