abbrev omnimath3475_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3475 (x : ℝ) (hx : x < -2) :
  IsLeast {y : ℝ | y = x ∨ y = x + 2 ∨ y = (1/2) * x ∨ y = x - 2 ∨ y = 2 * x} (omnimath3475_answer x) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 2 * x
Proposed Answer: fun x => x - 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the least element in the set {x, x+2, (1/2)x, x-2, 2x} when x < -2.

2. For x < -2:
   - x-2 is always less than x (since we subtract 2)
   - 2x is less than x (since x is negative and multiplying by 2 makes it more negative)
   - We need to compare 2x and x-2:
     For x < -2, 2x < x-2 (since x < -2 ⇒ 2x < -4 and x-2 < -4, but 2x grows faster in the negative direction)

3. The ground truth answer (2x) is indeed the smallest element for all x < -2.

4. The proposed answer (x-2) is not always the smallest:
   - For x = -3: set is {-3, -1, -1.5, -5, -6} → smallest is -6 (2x)
   - x-2 = -5 which is not the smallest
