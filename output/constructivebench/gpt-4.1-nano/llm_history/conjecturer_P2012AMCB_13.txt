theorem P2012AMCB_13 :
  let Ω := Fin 6 × Fin 6 × Fin 6 × Fin 6
  let total := 6 * 6 * 6 * 6
  let count := Fintype.card {ω : Ω // ∃ x, x^2 + ω.1 * x + ω.2.1 = x^2 + ω.2.2.1 * x + ω.2.2.2}
  count / total = P2012AMCB_13_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The problem asks for the probability that a quadratic polynomial with coefficients from pairs in Fin 6 has a root in the same domain. The enumeration suggests the total counts of such polynomials. The key insight is that a quadratic over a finite field has either zero or two roots, and the probability relates to whether the discriminant is a quadratic residue. For finite fields of size 6 (not prime, but treat as composite), the proportion of quadratics with roots corresponds to the discriminant being a quadratic residue. The ratio is \(\frac{1}{2}\).
