Ground Truth Answer: 360
Proposed Answer: 180 * 4^4
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting the number of functions from Fin 5 → Fin 10 (i.e., 5-digit numbers where each digit is 1-9) that satisfy:
   - First digit is non-zero (d 0 ≠ 0)
   - Product of all digits equals 180 (∏ d i = 180)

2. The ground truth answer is 360.

3. The proposed answer is 180 * 4^4 = 180 * 256 = 46080, which is much larger than 360.

4. The correct approach would be:
   - Factorize 180 = 2² * 3² * 5
   - Count distributions of these prime factors across 5 digits (with first digit ≠ 0)
   - The correct count is indeed 360

The proposed answer is incorrect as it overcounts by considering all possible digit assignments without properly accounting for the factorization constraints.
