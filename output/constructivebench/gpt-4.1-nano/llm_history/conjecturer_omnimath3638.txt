abbrev omnimath3638_answer : ℕ → ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3638 (n : ℕ) :
  ∑ k in Finset.range (n + 1), (10^k - 1)/9 = omnimath3638_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℚ
The sum of (10^k - 1)/9 from k=0 to n simplifies to (10^{n+1} - (n+1) - 1)/9; pattern suggests a closed form involving powers of 10 minus a linear term, divided by 9. Thus, the closed form is:

<<<fun n => (10^(n+1) - (n + 1) - 1 : ℚ) / 9>>>
