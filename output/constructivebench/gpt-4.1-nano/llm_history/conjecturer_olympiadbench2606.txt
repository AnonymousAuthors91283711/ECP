The pattern suggests selecting \(k= \max \{k' : k' \le 1000 \wedge 7 \mid \binom{1000}{k'}\}\). Given the symmetry of binomial coefficients and divisibility patterns, the supremum is at \(k=500\) or near the edges, but for the greatest \(k\) satisfying the divisibility, the answer should be \(k=1000\).
