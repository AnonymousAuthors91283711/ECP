theorem olympiadbench2781 :
  let T := 7/8
  let m := 7
  let n := 8
  let roots := {x : ℚ | x^2 + (m + n) * x + m * n = 0}
  IsLeast (roots \ {-n}) olympiadbench2781_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Given roots of x^2 + 15x + 56 = 0, roots are x = -7 or -8. Excluding -8, the least root is -7. Final answer is -7. Thus,
