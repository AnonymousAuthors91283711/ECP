Ground Truth Answer: 3 * π / 4
Proposed Answer: π / 4
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the least positive real number t where we can find three distinct real numbers (f(0), f(1), f(2)) that are:
   - Injective (all distinct)
   - Each equal to one of {arcsin(sin t), arccos(cos t), arctan(tan t)}
   - Forming an arithmetic progression with non-zero common difference

2. The ground truth answer is 3π/4. Let's verify this:
   - At t = 3π/4:
     arcsin(sin(3π/4)) = π/4
     arccos(cos(3π/4)) = 3π/4
     arctan(tan(3π/4)) = -π/4
   - These form an arithmetic progression: -π/4, π/4, 3π/4 with common difference π/2

3. The proposed answer is π/4:
   - At t = π/4:
     arcsin(sin(π/4)) = π/4
     arccos(cos(π/4)) = π/4
     arctan(tan(π/4)) = π/4
   - All three values are equal (π/4), so they don't form an injective function or arithmetic progression

The proposed answer π/4 doesn't satisfy the problem's conditions, while 3π/4 does. They are not equivalent.
