theorem omnimath3401 (p : ℝ) (h : 0 ≤ p ∧ p ≤ 100) : 
  {q | q = 100 - p ∧ 0 ≤ q ∧ q ≤ 100} = {omnimath3401_answer p} := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
The answer is \( q = 100 - p \). It uniquely solves the condition set, and the pattern in enumeration suggests a direct linear relation.
