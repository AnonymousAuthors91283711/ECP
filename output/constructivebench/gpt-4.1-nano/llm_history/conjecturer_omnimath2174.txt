  Fintype.card {x : Fin n | x.val + 1 = n} / Fintype.card (Fin n) = omnimath2174_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℚ
The enumerated answers suggest the fraction simplifies to a function related to the ratio of specific finite set sizes, with numerator as 1 and denominator as n. Since the set {x : Fin n | x.val + 1 = n} has exactly 1 element for n > 0, the ratio (1 / n) matches these observations.

<<<fun n => 1 / n>>>
