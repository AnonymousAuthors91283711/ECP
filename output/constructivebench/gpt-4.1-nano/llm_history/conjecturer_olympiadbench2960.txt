Given the constraints, the problem essentially asks for a digit \( d < 10 \) that is not contained in the decimal digits of any perfect square \( n \) with \( 100 \leq n \leq 400 \). Squares in this range are 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400. Digits appearing in these are {1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 5, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 3, 2, 4, 3, 6, 1, 4, 2, 5, 6, 2, 8, 9, 3, 2, 4, 3, 6, 1, 4}. Unpresent digits are 0, 7. 

Choosing 7 (which does not appear in any of these square representations) ensures the property holds. 

Final answer:

<<<7>>>
