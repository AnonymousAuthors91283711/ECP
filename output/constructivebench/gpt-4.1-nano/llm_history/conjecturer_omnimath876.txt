The problem involves covering all odd integers modulo 1024 with non-empty sets assigned to each index. The minimal such m should be at least half of 1024, rounding up since each cycle can cover only one residue class. With 512 sets, all 512 odd residues can be covered (since 1024/2=512). Thus, the minimal m is 512.

<<<512>>>
