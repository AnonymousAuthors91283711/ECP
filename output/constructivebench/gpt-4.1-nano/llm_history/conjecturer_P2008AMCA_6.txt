The main issue is that within the definition of `P2008AMCA_6_answer`, the variable `sticker_price` is used without being explicitly defined or scoped into a lambda function, so Lean cannot recognize it. To fix this, the answer should be given as an explicit formula for `sticker_price` in terms of the other parameters, rather than a statement involving `sticker_price` itself. 

Since the desired `sticker_price` is obtained by solving the equation:

\[ (0.85 \cdot sticker\_price - 90) - (0.75 \cdot sticker\_price) = 15, \]

which simplifies to:

\[ 0.85 \cdot sticker\_price - 90 - 0.75 \cdot sticker\_price = 15, \]

and further simplifies to:

\[ (0.85 - 0.75) \cdot sticker\_price = 15 + 90, \]

leading to:

\[ 0.10 \cdot sticker\_price = 105, \]

thus:

\[ sticker\_price = \frac{105}{0.10} = 1050. \]

Expressed as a more general formula that handles rational calculations, this can be written as:

\[ \frac{(15 + 90)}{0.85 - 0.75}. \]

To write this in Lean, I will compute the formula directly, ensuring the numerator and denominator are explicitly specified as rationals, and formulating the answer as a fixed number, 1050.

\(\boxed{
\texttt{(15 + 90) / (0.85 - 0.75)}}
\)

which simplifies to:

\(\frac{105}{0.10} = 1050\).

Thus, the Lean formula should be:

>>> (15 + 90) / (0.85 - 0.75) <<<

which correctly produces the value 1050, and is general quite straightforwardly.

Final answer: 

>>> (15 + 90) / (0.85 - 0.75) <<<

This formula is the closed-form solution for `sticker_price`. It doesn't rely on a variable undefined in the context and captures the algebraic solution as a formula.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The problem involves solving an equation relating rebates and sticker price, with the key equations:
rebate_A = 0.85 * sticker_price - 90,
rebate_B = 0.75 * sticker_price,
and the condition rebate_B - rebate_A = 15.

From the equations:
rebate_B - rebate_A = (0.75 * sticker_price) - (0.85 * sticker_price - 90) = (0.75 * sticker_price - 0.85 * sticker_price) + 90 = (-0.10 * sticker_price) + 90.

Setting this equal to 15:
-0.10 * sticker_price + 90 = 15,
which leads to
-0.10 * sticker_price = 15 - 90 = -75,
and solving for sticker_price:
sticker_price = -75 / -0.10 = 750 / 0.10 = 7500.

But since the calculation actually yields 7500, and the original problem expects 1050 based on the description (or an order of magnitude mistake), carefully recomputing:

Wait, let's do it step by step:
rebate_B - rebate_A = 15,
=> 0.75 * sticker_price - (0.85 * sticker_price - 90) = 15,
=> 0.75 * sticker_price - 0.85 * sticker_price + 90 = 15,
=> (-0.10 * sticker_price) + 90 = 15,
=> -0.10 * sticker_price = 15 - 90 = -75,
=> sticker_price = -75 / -0.10 = 750.

So the solution for sticker_price is 750, matching the pattern of previous calculations. If the intended answer is 1050, perhaps in the problem setup, the coefficient differs, but based on current equations and logic, 750 is the correct solution.

Therefore, the final answer (the value of sticker_price) in closed form is 750.

Now, to correct the code: The abbreviation should be a ℝ, namely the number 750, and the problem is to relate the condition to this solution.

Thus, the code:
- Define P2008AMCA_6_answer as 750, as the solution.
- The biconditional in the theorem indicates it equals that value.

The fixed code should look like:

<<<1050>>>

but based on calculations, it is 750.

**Note**: if the problem’s data yields 1050, double check the coefficients. But given your calculations and equations, 750 is consistent.

**Final answer**:

<<<750>>>
