Ground Truth Answer: 18
Proposed Answer: 60
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about basketball scoring where:
   - Total attempts (3-point + 2-point) = 30
   - 3-pointers made = attempts/5 (integer division)
   - 2-pointers made = 3*attempts/10 (integer division)
   - Total score = 3*(3-pointers made) + 2*(2-pointers made)

2. The ground truth answer is 18, while the proposed answer is 60.

3. To verify, let's find the maximum possible score:
   - Maximum 3-point attempts = 30 (all attempts are 3-pointers)
     - Made = 30/5 = 6
     - Score = 3*6 = 18
   - Maximum 2-point attempts = 30 (all attempts are 2-pointers)
     - Made = 3*30/10 = 9
     - Score = 2*9 = 18
   - Mixed attempts will also yield 18 (e.g., 15 each: 15/5=3 and 3*15/10=4 → 3*3+2*4=17, but this is less than 18)

The proposed answer (60) is much higher than the maximum possible score (18). The calculations clearly show the correct answer should be 18.
