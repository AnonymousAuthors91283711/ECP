The sum resembles a telescoping series associated with tangent subtraction, since:

1 / (cos A cos (A + π/180)) = tan(A + π/180) - tan A.

Thus, summing over k from 0 to 88 yields tan(π/2) - tan(0) which diverges to infinity, but near the endpoint, the finite sum telescopes accordingly. The telescoping sum from small positive angles approximates to tan(π/2) - 0, which tends to infinity, but the sum is finite due to the bounded angles in the problem. The sum telescopes as:

tan(π/180 * (k + 1)) - tan(π/180 * k).

Thus, the total sum over k = 0 to 88 simplifies to tan(π/180 * 89) - tan(0). Since tan(0) = 0:

Answer: tan(π * 89 / 180).

Therefore,

<<<tan (π * 89 / 180)>>>
