Given the nature of the problem, involving coprimality among functions from a finite set and the injectivity of products, the minimal such k corresponds to the maximum number of pairwise coprime subsets with nonempty elements—essentially the maximum size of a family of pairwise coprime nonempty subsets of a 2021-element set. For the case of pairwise coprime subsets, the maximum number occurs with singleton subsets, totaling 2021. Therefore, the least such k is 2021.
