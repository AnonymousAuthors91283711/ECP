theorem mathodyssey179 (x : ℝ) (y : ℝ) :
    (∃ (m b : ℝ), y = m * x + b ∧ m = -5 ∧ b = -3) ↔ y = mathodyssey179_answer x := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
The given conditions imply y = -5x -3. Patterned from enumeration, and generalizing, the final answer is a direct functional form: y = m * x + b with m = -5 and b = -3. Thus, the closed form is the linear function with these fixed parameters. The answer disregards existential quantifiers by directly defining the function.
