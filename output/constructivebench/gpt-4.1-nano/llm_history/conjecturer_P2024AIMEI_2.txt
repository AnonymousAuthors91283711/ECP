  ∃ x y : ℝ, 1 < x ∧ 1 < y ∧ logb x (y^x) = 10 ∧ logb y (x^(4*y)) = 10 ∧ x * y = P2024AIMEI_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests a symmetric relation with powers involving x and y, where the logs equal 10, and their product is the answer. Based on the structure, the final answer is likely the value where the logs are balanced such that x and y are conjugate in the power relation. The natural candidate balancing both equations is x = y = 10, giving the simple exponential relation. Therefore,
