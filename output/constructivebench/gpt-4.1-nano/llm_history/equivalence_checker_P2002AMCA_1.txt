Ground Truth Answer: 7/2
Proposed Answer: (7 : ℚ)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the sum of roots of a polynomial equation. The polynomial is given as:
   (2X + 3)(X - 4) + (2X + 3)(X - 6)

2. First, let's simplify the polynomial:
   (2X + 3)[(X - 4) + (X - 6)] = (2X + 3)(2X - 10) = 4X² - 20X + 6X - 30 = 4X² - 14X - 30

3. For a quadratic polynomial aX² + bX + c, the sum of roots is -b/a. Here:
   a = 4, b = -14
   Sum of roots = -(-14)/4 = 14/4 = 7/2

4. The ground truth answer is 7/2 (3.5 in decimal), which matches our calculation.

5. The proposed answer is (7 : ℚ), which is just 7 in rational numbers.

The proposed answer (7) is different from the correct answer (7/2). They are not equivalent.
