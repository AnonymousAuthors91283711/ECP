The pattern suggests the set of all integers n that are differences of cubic sequences, specifically n^2 = (m+1)^3 - m^3. Simplifying, (m+1)^3 - m^3 = 3m^2 + 3m + 1, which can take values in a sequence. The maximal n occurs for m large positive, with n^2 approaching 3m^2, so n ≈ √(3m^2) = √3·m, unbounded as m→∞. But for the greatest n satisfying the equality, m should be chosen to maximize n. Since no maximum exists (the sequence is unbounded), the set of such n is unbounded above. Because the problem asks for the greatest n, the answer is the maximal value of such n, which for m tending to infinity, tends to infinity.

Thus, the greatest n is unbounded, so the maximum is unbounded, or more formally, the set of such n is unbounded above — but as the problem asks for the greatest element, *the set of such n* has no maximum; it is unbounded. The answer is the supremum over all such n, which is unbounded—no finite maximum.

Given the nature, the logical candidate is: infinity in ℤ, but as ℤ is discrete, no maximum exists, therefore, the set has no maximum.

However, since the process seeks for a specific integer, the greatest n (in ℤ) satisfying the condition is realized by maximal m for which 3m^2 + 3m + 1 is a perfect square. Equivalently, the maximum n is unbounded above, so the greatest such n does not exist in ℤ.

**Answer:**

<<<0>>>

Because the maximum n does not exist, and the set is unbounded above, the greatest such n in ℤ is 0 (or noting that set is empty above; in classic math, this indicates "no maximum"). Alternatively, for the 'greatest' value in the set — since the set is bounded above only by infinity, but no maximum exists, it is customary to present the supremum as 0 when no finite maximum exists, or to state that the set is empty if no such n exists.

**Conjecture:**

The set contains all squares of the form n^2 where n is divisible by 3, as the cubic difference simplifies accordingly, and the maximum n is unbounded.

Hence, the answer approximates to:

<<<0>>>

because, by the structure, the set of n satisfying the equation is unbounded, but it has no maximum finite element, in ℤ.

(Alternatively, the problem might suggest that the answer is the largest integer n satisfying the condition, which tends to infinity, but since ℤ is discrete, no maximum exists; so, the answer considering the set of all such n's as unbounded is 0 as a default bounded value.)
