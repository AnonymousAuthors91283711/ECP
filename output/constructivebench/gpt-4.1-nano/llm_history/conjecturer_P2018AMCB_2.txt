theorem P2018AMCB_2 :
  let total_distance := 96
  let first_distance := 60 * (30 / 60)
  let second_distance := 65 * (30 / 60)
  let third_distance := total_distance - first_distance - second_distance
  third_distance / (30 / 60) = P2018AMCB_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The third segment is 96 - 60*(1/2) - 65*(1/2) = 96 - 30 - 32.5 = 33.5. Dividing by 0.5 yields 67. Therefore, the total answer simplifies to 67. The consistent pattern suggests the answer is a constant. 

<<<67>>>()
