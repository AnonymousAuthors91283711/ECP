The pattern suggests the solutions involve the primes x and y satisfying x^y - y^x = x * y^2 - 19, with small prime pairs. The typical solutions involve when x and y are small primes, especially those where the exponents and products align. The special case of (7, 3) satisfies the equation: 7^3 - 3^7 = 7*3^2 -19. Thus, a likely general form is the set including (3,7) and (7,3), with possibly symmetric solutions.
