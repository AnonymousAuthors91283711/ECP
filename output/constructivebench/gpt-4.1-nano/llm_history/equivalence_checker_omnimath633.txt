  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∃ (P Q : ℤ[X]), (X + 1)^n - 1 = (X^2 + 1) * P + 3 * Q} omnimath633_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 4
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n where (X+1)^n - 1 can be expressed as (X^2+1)*P + 3*Q for some integer polynomials P and Q.

2. The ground truth answer is 8, which means n=8 is the smallest number satisfying this condition.

3. The proposed answer is 4, claiming n=4 is the smallest such number.

4. Let's test n=4:
   (X+1)^4 - 1 = X^4 + 4X^3 + 6X^2 + 4X
   To express this as (X^2+1)*P + 3*Q, we'd need to handle the X^4 term through P, but then the remaining terms don't clearly factor into this form with integer coefficients.

5. Testing n=8 would show it works (as per the ground truth), but n=4 is too small to satisfy the condition with integer polynomials.

The proposed answer (4) is incorrect as it's smaller than the minimal solution (8).
