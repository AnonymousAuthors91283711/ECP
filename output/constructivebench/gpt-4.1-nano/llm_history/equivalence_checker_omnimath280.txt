Ground Truth Answer: fun n => choose (n - 1) 2
Proposed Answer: fun n => (n / 2) * (n / 2)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of pairs (i,j) with i<j where π(i)*π(j) > i*j for some permutation π of {1,...,n}.

2. The ground truth answer is the binomial coefficient C(n-1, 2), which equals (n-1)(n-2)/2.

3. The proposed answer is (n/2)*(n/2), which equals n²/4.

For n=3:
- Ground truth: C(2,2) = 1
- Proposed: (3/2)*(3/2) = 2.25 (but must be integer, so likely 1 or 2)
These don't match.

For n=4:
- Ground truth: C(3,2) = 3
- Proposed: (4/2)*(4/2) = 4
These don't match.

For n=5:
- Ground truth: C(4,2) = 6
- Proposed: (5/2)*(5/2) = 6.25 (likely 6 or 9)
These don't match.

The answers give different results for multiple values of n, and the proposed answer doesn't match the combinatorial nature of the problem.
