Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => a + b
Proposed Answer: fun a b : ℕ => 1 + (2021 - 45 * a)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the minimal sum a + b where a and b are positive integers satisfying 45a + b = 2021.

2. The ground truth answer correctly identifies that we need to minimize a + b, which is equivalent to minimizing a + (2021 - 45a) = 2021 - 44a.

3. The proposed answer gives 1 + (2021 - 45a), which is not equivalent to a + b (which would be a + (2021 - 45a) = 2021 - 44a).

4. The proposed answer is incorrect because:
   - It doesn't represent the sum a + b
   - It adds 1 for no mathematical reason
   - It doesn't minimize the expression

The two answers are not equivalent.
