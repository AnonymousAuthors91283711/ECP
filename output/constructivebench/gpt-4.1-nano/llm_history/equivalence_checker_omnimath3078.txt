abbrev omnimath3078_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3078 :
  let (x, y, z) := (2, 2^2 - 5, (2^2 - 5)^2 - 5);
  z = omnimath3078_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: -4
Proposed Answer: (2^2 - 5)^2 - 5
Let's analyze the problem and answers step by step:

1. The problem defines three variables:
   - x = 2
   - y = 2² - 5 = 4 - 5 = -1
   - z = y² - 5 = (-1)² - 5 = 1 - 5 = -4

2. The theorem states that z should equal omnimath3078_answer
3. Ground truth answer gives the final evaluated value: -4
4. Proposed answer gives the expression: (2² - 5)² - 5

While the proposed answer is the correct expression for z, it hasn't been simplified to its final numerical value (-4) as required by the theorem. The ground truth answer gives the simplified final value.

The proposed answer is correct in terms of the expression but hasn't been simplified to match the required form of the ground truth answer.
