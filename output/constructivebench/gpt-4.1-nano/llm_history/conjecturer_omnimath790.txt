The condition \( \sin x + \cos x = \sqrt{2} \) implies \( \sin x = \cos x \). Since \( 0 ≤ x < 2π \), \( \sin x = \cos x \) at \( x = π/4 \) and \( x = 5π/4 \). Within the given bounds, the only satisfying \( x \) is \( π/4 \). 

thus, the set consists of \( \{ π/4 \} \).

theorem omnimath790 :
  {x : ℝ | 0 ≤ x ∧ x < 2 * Real.pi ∧ Real.sin x + Real.cos x = Real.sqrt 2} = omnimath790_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: {π/4}. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 38, which is at "π/4}" in "abbrev omnimath790_answer : Set ℝ := {π/4}", there is an error: unknown identifier 'π'.
. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The error in the current proposed answer arises because 'π' is not recognized as an identifier in Lean's standard library, especially since 'π' isn't predefined in 'Real'. Instead, the correct approach is to use 'Real.pi', which is the standard notation for π in Lean's 'Mathlib'. 

Furthermore, since the problem characterizes the set of solutions to the equation sin x + cos x = √2 within a specific interval, and from the well-known solutions of that equation, the only solutions in [0, 2π) are at x = π/4 and x = 5π/4. The problem's condition focuses on the set where 0 ≤ x < 2π, so the solutions are these two points.

Therefore, the set of solutions is {π/4, 5π/4}. The final answer should be a set containing these two points expressed with 'Real.pi'.

The fixed answer:

<<<{Real.pi / 4, 5 * Real.pi / 4}>>>

This encapsulates the two solutions in the given interval, correctly uses 'Real.pi', and is in the proper set notation for Lean.
