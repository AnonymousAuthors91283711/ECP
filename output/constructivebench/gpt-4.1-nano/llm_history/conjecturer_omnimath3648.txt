The pattern suggests the solution is a reciprocal function involving linear terms. Based on the structure of the recurrence, the function is likely of form \(f(x) = \frac{c}{x}\) for some constant. Given the condition \(f(x*y) = y * f(x) + 1\), substituting \(f(x) = c / x\) yields a consistent solution for \(c = 1\). 

Final answer:
<<<fun x : ℝ => 1 / x>>>
