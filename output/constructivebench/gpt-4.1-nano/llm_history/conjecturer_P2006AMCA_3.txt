theorem P2006AMCA_3 (aliceAge : ℕ) (h : aliceAge = 30) :
  ∃ maryAge, maryAge = P2006AMCA_3_answer aliceAge ∧ (maryAge : ℚ) / aliceAge = 3 / 5 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Since maryAge / aliceAge = 3/5, then maryAge = (3/5) * aliceAge. For aliceAge = 30, maryAge = (3/5) * 30 = 18. Generalizing, the answer is (3/5) * aliceAge as an integer, i.e., 3 * aliceAge / 5. Thus, in Lean syntax:

<<<fun aliceAge => 3 * aliceAge / 5>>>
