  (Complex.exp (I * (2 * π / 3))) ^ 6 + (Complex.exp (I * (4 * π / 3))) ^ 6 = omnimath3335_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℂ
The two complex exponentials are roots of unity: \( e^{i2\pi/3} \) and \( e^{i4\pi/3} \). Their sixth powers yield 1 because \( (e^{i2\pi/3})^6 = e^{i4\pi\pi} = 1 \) and similarly for the second term. Therefore, sum equals 1 + 1 = 2.
