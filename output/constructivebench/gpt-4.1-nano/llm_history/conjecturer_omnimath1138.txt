The problem involves permutations of S = {1..9} where f composed thrice returns s, and f s ≠ 3-divisible difference from s. Given the enumeration hints, the pattern indicates the number of such functions is 720, aligning with the total permutations of 9 elements, consistent with the conditions since the cycle structure satisfies f³ = id, and the non-divisibility condition eliminates only some cycles. Thus, the count is 9! = 362880. However, the pattern from enumeration suggests fewer; considering the constraints typically eliminate cycle types, leading to 144. Based on enumeration and constraints, the plausible count matching the logical deduction and pattern is 144.

<<<144>>>
