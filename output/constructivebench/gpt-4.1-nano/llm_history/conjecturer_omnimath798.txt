abbrev omnimath798_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath798 (n : ℕ) :
  (∃! (s : Finset ℕ), s.card = 8 ∧ (∀ x ∈ s, 0 < x) ∧ s.sum id = n) ↔ n ∈ omnimath798_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests constructing sets with 8 positive integers summing to n, and the enumeration indicates linear relations. Given the constraints, the answer set encompasses all n that can be expressed as sums of 8 positive integers, with the minimal sum 8 (all ones). The achievable sums form an interval from 8 upwards, with all integers ≥8.  
Therefore, the set of all such n is exactly all integers ≥8.  
Answer: <<< {n | 8 ≤ n} >>>
