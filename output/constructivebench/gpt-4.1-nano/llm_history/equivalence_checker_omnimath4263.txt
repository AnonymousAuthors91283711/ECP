Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | (n = 1) ∨ (Nat.Prime n)}
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∃! a : ℤ, 0 ≤ a ∧ a < factorial n ∧ (factorial n : ℤ) ∣ a ^ n + 1}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is a restatement of the problem itself, not a solution. The ground truth answer provides the actual solution set: {n : ℕ | (n = 1) ∨ (Nat.Prime n)}. The proposed answer doesn't simplify or solve the problem, it just repeats the conditions given in the problem statement. Therefore, they are not equivalent, but the proposed answer is "Close" in the sense that it correctly represents the problem's conditions, just not the solution.
