Because the property requires the fractional part of n/(10^k) to exceed n/(10^10) for all k in 1..9, n must be sufficiently large relative to (10^10), but smaller than 10^10 to satisfy fractional inequalities. The minimal such n corresponds to n just greater than 10^10 * (some small margin), which simplifies to the smallest n satisfying 0 < n < 10^10 and the fractional parts condition. The most natural minimal integer satisfying this is n = 10^10, as for smaller n, the fractional parts are too large, failing the inequality; for n ≥ 10^10, the fractions are sufficiently small, and fractional parts are adequately large. Therefore, the number of such n is exactly 1, namely n = 10^10.
