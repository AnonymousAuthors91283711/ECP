The pattern suggests solutions where the primes satisfy the quadratic sum condition related to perfect squares, with minimal values like (3, 2, 5, 1). The structure hints at solutions involving parametrizations of primes related to quadratic forms. The minimal prime solutions are (3, 2, 5, 1), and potential general solutions involve small primes fitting the equation.

Based on this, the general form fixes a, b, c to small prime combinations satisfying the quadratic relation, with k as an integer scaling factor.

Therefore, the set includes all (a, b, c, k) where a, b, c are primes satisfying a particular quadratic relation scaled by k. An explicit minimal solution is (a, b, c, k) = (3, 2, 5, 1).

In line with the problem's structure, the best expressive closed form capturing the known minimal solutions is:

The current proposed answer is a set containing the minimal known solution point, (3, 2, 5, 1). To fix the syntax error, the set expression must be enclosed with curly braces, and the set should be explicitly constructed as a singleton with Lean syntax. Relying on the pattern observed, the answer set is simply those quadruples matching this specific tuple, representing the minimal solution. Since the problem's structure suggests only considering such minimal solutions, the closed form representation in Lean would be:

<<<{(3, 2, 5, 1)}>>>

This set captures the known minimal solution explicitly, avoiding the syntax issues caused by the previous attempt and aligning with the enumerated solution pattern.
