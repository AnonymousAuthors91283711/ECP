Ground Truth Answer: 59
Proposed Answer: 30
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us four equations involving averages of three variables each time. This is a system of equations we can solve to find the values of a, b, c, d.

2. Let's solve the system:
   - From h₁: a + b + c = 96
   - From h₂: a + b + d = 117
   - From h₃: a + c + d = 120
   - From h₄: b + c + d = 132

3. Subtracting h₁ from h₂ gives d - c = 21
4. Subtracting h₂ from h₃ gives c - b = 3
5. Subtracting h₃ from h₄ gives b - a = 12

6. Now we can express all variables in terms of a:
   - b = a + 12
   - c = b + 3 = a + 15
   - d = c + 21 = a + 36

7. Substituting into h₁: a + (a+12) + (a+15) = 96 → 3a + 27 = 96 → a = 23
8. Therefore:
   - b = 35
   - c = 38
   - d = 59

9. The maximum of these values is clearly 59 (d).

The proposed answer (30) is incorrect as it doesn't match any of the calculated values, nor is it the maximum of them. The ground truth answer (59) is correct.
