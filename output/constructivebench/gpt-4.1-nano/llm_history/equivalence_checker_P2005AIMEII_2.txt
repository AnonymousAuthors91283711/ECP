Ground Truth Answer: (6, 79)
Proposed Answer: (3 * (factorial 3) ^ 3, choose 9 3 * choose 6 3 * choose 3 3)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating a probability where:
   - Total possible outcomes: choose 9 3 * choose 6 3 * choose 3 3
   - Favorable outcomes: 6 * (factorial 3)^3
   - The answer should be the simplified fraction favorable/total

2. Ground truth answer is (6, 79) which is the simplified form.

3. Proposed answer gives the unsimplified forms:
   - Numerator: 3 * (factorial 3)^3 = 3 * 6^3 = 3 * 216 = 648
   - Denominator: choose 9 3 * choose 6 3 * choose 3 3 = 84 * 20 * 1 = 1680

4. Simplifying 648/1680:
   - GCD of 648 and 1680 is 24
   - 648/24 = 27, 1680/24 = 70
   - So simplified form is 27/70, not 6/79

The proposed answer gives the correct expressions but fails to simplify them to the ground truth answer. The simplified form of the proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth.
