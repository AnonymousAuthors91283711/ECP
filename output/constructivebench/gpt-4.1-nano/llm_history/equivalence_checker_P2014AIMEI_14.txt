Ground Truth Answer: 7 + sqrt (247 + sqrt 9)
Proposed Answer: 132 + sqrt (132 + sqrt 263)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the greatest real number x satisfying certain conditions, with the solution to be expressed in the form a + √(b + √c) where a, b, c are positive integers summing to 263.

2. Ground Truth Answer: 7 + √(247 + √9)
   - a=7, b=247, c=9
   - Sum: 7 + 247 + 9 = 263 (correct)
   - √9 = 3 (valid)

3. Proposed Answer: 132 + √(132 + √263)
   - a=132, b=132, c=263
   - Sum: 132 + 132 + 263 = 527 ≠ 263 (incorrect sum)
   - The structure doesn't match the required form since c appears directly under the second square root

The proposed answer fails both the sum requirement and the proper nested square root structure.
