theorem omnimath4324 :
  (∀ (a : ℕ → ℕ), (∀ k, ∃ t, ∀ m, a (k + m * t) = a k) → ∃ T, ∀ k, a (k + T) = a k) ↔ omnimath4324_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Prop
Conjecture: The statement resembles periodicity of functions; the answer likely asserts the existence of a uniform period T for all sequences satisfying the condition. Based on pattern and typical form:

<<<∀ a : ℕ → ℕ, (∀ k, ∃ t, ∀ m, a (k + m * t) = a k) → ∃ T, ∀ k, a (k + T) = a k>>>
