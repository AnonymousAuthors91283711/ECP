Ground Truth Answer: 204
Proposed Answer: 4^2 * 3^3
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem involves counting valid function assignments from Fin 5 → Fin 4 where:
   - Parents (elements 0,1) cannot share values with children (elements 2,3,4)
   - Stores are all possible values (Fin 4)

2. The counting logic:
   - For parents (2 elements): 4 choices each (4^2)
   - For children (3 elements): For each child, must choose from the 3 values not used by parents (3^3)
   - Total assignments: 4^2 * 3^3 = 16 * 27 = 432

3. The ground truth answer is 204, which is different from 432.

The proposed answer's approach is correct in structure (separating parents and children), but the calculation is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that parents might choose the same value (which affects how many forbidden values the children have).
