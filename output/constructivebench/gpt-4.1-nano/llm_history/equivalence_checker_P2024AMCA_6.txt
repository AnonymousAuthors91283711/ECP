Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 6
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest positive integer s such that there exist integers a, b, c where:
   - a*b*c = 60
   - a + b + c = s

2. The ground truth answer is 3. This can be achieved with:
   - (a, b, c) = (1, 5, 12) → 1*5*12=60 and 1+5+12=18
   - (a, b, c) = (2, 3, 10) → 2*3*10=60 and 2+3+10=15
   - (a, b, c) = (3, 4, 5) → 3*4*5=60 and 3+4+5=12
   - (a, b, c) = (1, 6, 10) → 1*6*10=60 and 1+6+10=17
   - (a, b, c) = (1, 4, 15) → 1*4*15=60 and 1+4+15=20
   - (a, b, c) = (1, 3, 20) → 1*3*20=60 and 1+3+20=24
   - (a, b, c) = (1, 2, 30) → 1*2*30=60 and 1+2+30=33
   - (a, b, c) = (-1, -5, 12) → (-1)*(-5)*12=60 and (-1)+(-5)+12=6
   - (a, b, c) = (-3, -4, 5) → (-3)*(-4)*5=60 and (-3)+(-4)+5=-2

   The smallest sum is actually -2 (from (-3, -4, 5)), but if we restrict to positive sums, the smallest is 6 (from (-1, -5, 12)).

3. The proposed answer is 6, which is correct if we consider only positive sums (as implied by 0 < s in the problem statement). The ground truth answer of 3 is incorrect as no combination gives sum 3.

<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is correct given the problem constraints (0 < s). The ground truth answer appears to be incorrect.
