The answer set is determined by divisibility conditions, considering zeros in the product. Since a product modulo 1001 equals zero iff at least one factor is divisible by 7, 11, or 13 (since 1001=7*11*13), the valid n are those where (n-2), (n), (n-1), or (n-7) is divisible by 7, 11, or 13. The minimal n satisfying these divisibility conditions fall within 1 to 2017.

Hence, the count of such n is the union of those with at least one factor divisible.

The total count focuses on the set {n: n ∈ 1..2017, where at least one of the four factors is divisible by 7, 11, or 13}.

This simplifies, given symmetry and the pattern observed, to considering n divisible by 7, 11, or 13 within the interval 1..2017, and accounting for overlaps when multiple divisibility conditions apply.

Based on the pattern, the total number of such n is the sum of counts of those divisible by 7, 11, or 13, minus overlaps, which corresponds to inclusion-exclusion principle.

Total: 3 * ⌊2017/7⌋ + 3 * ⌊2017/11⌋ + 3 * ⌊2017/13⌋ minus overlaps.

Calculations show the total is: 3 * (288 + 183 + 155) - 3*(⌊2017/77⌋ + ⌊2017/91⌋ + ⌊2017/143⌋) + 3 * ⌊2017/1001⌋.

Count over 1..2017 = 3 * (288 + 183 + 155) - 3*(37 + 22 + 14) + 3*2 = 3 * 626 - 3 * 73 + 6 = 1878 - 219 + 6 = 1665.

Final answer: 1665.
