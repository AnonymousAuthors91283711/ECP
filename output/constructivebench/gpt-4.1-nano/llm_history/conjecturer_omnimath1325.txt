The set \( S n = \{ m \mid m \ge 1 \wedge \exists k \ge 1, m = k(n+1) \} \) consists of all multiples of \( n+1 \) starting at 1. To find the least \( n \) such that \( 2004 \in S n \), solve \( 2004 = k(n+1) \) with \( k \ge 1 \). The minimal \( n \) occurs when \( k=1 \): \( 2004 = n+1 \Rightarrow n=2003 \).
