theorem omnimath2303 :
  let S := {n : ℕ | 2 ≤ (digits 10 n).length ∧ (digits 10 n).Nodup}
  let E := {n ∈ S | Even n}
  Nat.card E / Nat.card S = omnimath2303_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The subset S contains numbers with at least two digits and all digits distinct; E contains the even such numbers. The proportion of even numbers among those with at least two distinct digits converges to 1/5, since digit parity is uniform and distribution over last digits among these is uniform and independent for large sets.
