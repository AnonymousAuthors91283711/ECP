The problem describes pairs (x, y) with positive integers satisfying x + 2y = 100, aiming for the total number of such pairs, which is the count of solutions. Since x > 0, y > 0, and x = 100 - 2y, for x > 0, 100 - 2y > 0 ⇒ y < 50, y > 0, thus y ranges from 1 to 49. Total solutions = 49. 

Answer: <<<49>>>
