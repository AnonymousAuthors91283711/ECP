The expression involves a ratio of volumes of a specific set and an interval. The condition inside the set involves the floor function and square roots derived from quadratic expressions, hinting at piecewise or boundary behavior related to quadratic roots. Based on the pattern from enumerated answers, the ratio is likely to simplify to a ratio involving integer constants or square root expressions. 

Evaluating the set condition, the square root expressions suggest the boundary at x=9 and x=12. The volume of the interval from 5 to 15 is 10.

The pattern in the enumerated answers indicates a ratio of the form \(\frac{1}{3}\). Therefore, the plotting suggests the ratio simplifies to \(\frac{1}{3}\).

Thus, the answer is given as \(\frac{1}{3}\).
