Ground Truth Answer: 20 / 3
Proposed Answer: 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two equations:
   - 20 = 4a² + 9b²
   - 20 + 12ab = (2a + 3b)²

2. Let's expand the second equation:
   (2a + 3b)² = 4a² + 12ab + 9b²
   So the second equation becomes: 20 + 12ab = 4a² + 12ab + 9b²

3. Subtract 12ab from both sides: 20 = 4a² + 9b²
   But this is exactly the first equation, so the second equation doesn't give us any new information.

4. We're left with just one equation: 4a² + 9b² = 20
   This is an ellipse equation, and there are infinitely many (a,b) pairs that satisfy it, with different products a*b.

5. The ground truth answer claims a*b = 20/3, while the proposed answer claims a*b = 0.

6. Let's test if a*b = 0 is possible:
   - If a = 0: then from the equation we get 9b² = 20 ⇒ b = ±√(20/9) ⇒ a*b = 0
   - If b = 0: then 4a² = 20 ⇒ a = ±√5 ⇒ a*b = 0
   So a*b = 0 is indeed possible.

7. However, a*b = 20/3 is also possible (for example when a = √5, b = (2√5)/3).

The problem asks to find a*b, but from the given information, a*b is not uniquely determined - it can be 0, 20/3, or other values. Therefore:

<<<False>>>
