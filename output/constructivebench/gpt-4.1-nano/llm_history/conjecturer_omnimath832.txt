The sequences satisfy linear recurrences with roots that grow faster for `rabbit` than for `squirrel`. Comparing their explicit formulas, `rabbit y > squirrel y` for `y` greater than a certain value, which can be found via growth rates. The pattern suggests for large `y`, the minimal such `y` is 1. So, the answer is:

<<<1>>>
