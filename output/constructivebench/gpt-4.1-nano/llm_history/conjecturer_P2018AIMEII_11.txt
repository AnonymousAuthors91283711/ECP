The problem involves counting bijections on Fin 6 with a property about images of initial segments. The key is the condition that for each k in Fin 5, there exists an i with f i > k, implying a permutation where none of the first 5 elements map within themselves; i.e., the images of 0..4 cover {5}. The remaining element maps freely.

Hence, the number of such permutations equals choosing the image of 0..4 among {5..5} (fixed), with remaining elements as any permutation, but with the first 5 mapped outside their original positions.

This counts permutations fixing 5 outside the first 5 elements, with the rest being permutations over remaining set, considering the surjection-like condition.

Counting:

- images of {0..4} must include 5 (since for each k, there's i with f i > k), leading to permutations where upper 5 elements map into {0..5} with image 5 in the set, and remaining permutations.

The count simplifies to arrangements where 5 is in the image of one of the initial 5 positions, and others follow.

The total count matches the number of permutations on 6 elements where in the first 5 elements, the images include 5, i.e., permutations fixing 5 outside its position or with specific mappings.

From patterns in similar problems:

\[ \binom{5}{1} \times 5! \] (since choosing the position mapping to 5) times arrangements for the remaining.

Total:

\[ 5 \times 5! = 5 \times 120 = 600 \]

But since we are considering permutations where images cover lower indices and the condition is about existence, total permutations satisfying the condition are counted as:

\[ \boxed{120} \]

which is lower than 600, would be the number of permutations where the image of {0..4} covers 5 at least once, equivalent to permutations fixing 5 in a position.

Answer:

<<<120>>>
