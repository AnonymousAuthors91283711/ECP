theorem omnimath3060 :
  Nat.card {p : ℕ × ℕ | 1 ≤ p.1 ∧ p.1 ≤ 100 ∧ 101 ≤ p.2 ∧ p.2 ≤ 205 ∧ (3^p.1 + 7^p.2) % 10 = 0} = omnimath3060_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests that the count equals the product of choices for p.1 and p.2, considering the modular condition. For p.1 in [1,100], and p.2 in [101,205], the key is the sum's last digit condition, which aligns with divisibility by 10. Since the last digit of 3^p.1 cycles every 4, and for 7^p.2 as well, the count simplifies. The total number of solutions is the product of the number of p.1 satisfying the digit pattern and the total possibilities for p.2. 

The most straightforward closed form, based on the pattern (elements counted respecting modular conditions), is: 

<<<100 * 105>>>
