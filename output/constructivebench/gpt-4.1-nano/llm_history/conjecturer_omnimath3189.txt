theorem omnimath3189 (L P M : ℝ) :
  (∃ N, M = L + (1/3) * (P - L) ∧ N = L + (2/3) * (P - L) ∧ 
   M - L = N - M ∧ N - M = P - N) ↔ M = omnimath3189_answer L P := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
The pattern suggests M is a weighted average of L and P with weights 1/3, 2/3, and then the explicit formula involves these ratios. Simplifying, M should be the point dividing segment LP in ratio 1:2. The formula is M = L + (1/3)(P - L).
