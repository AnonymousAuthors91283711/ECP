abbrev P2013AMCB_1_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2013AMCB_1 :
  ∃! (low : ℝ), 
    let high := low + 16
    (high + low) / 2 = 3 ∧ low = P2013AMCB_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Because (high + low)/2 = 3 and high = low + 16, substituting:

(low + (low + 16))/2 = 3 → (2*low + 16)/2 = 3 → low + 8 = 3 → low = -5.

Given low = -5, P2013AMCB_1_answer is consistent with low, thus:

<<<-5>>>
