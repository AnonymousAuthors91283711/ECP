Ground Truth Answer: Ico 2 6
Proposed Answer: {x | 0 < x ∧ 2^x = x^2}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer describes the solution set (the set of all x satisfying the equation x² = 2ˣ with x > 0), while the ground truth answer (Ico 2 6) describes the sum of all elements in that solution set. These are not equivalent answers, but they are related - the proposed answer correctly identifies the set of solutions, while the ground truth answer provides the sum of those solutions. The proposed answer is correct about the solution set itself, but doesn't answer the actual question being asked about the sum of solutions.
