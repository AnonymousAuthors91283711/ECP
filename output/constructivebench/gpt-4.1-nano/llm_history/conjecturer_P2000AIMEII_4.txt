The pattern suggests the odd divisors count is 6, and even divisors count is 12, with divisors between 1 and n. To satisfy these, n must be divisible by 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 (odd divisors count 6) and by 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 (even divisors count 12). The smallest n satisfying both sets is their least common multiple with these factors.

Calculating: lcm(1,3,5,7,9,11) = 3^2*5*7*11 = 1155.  
Similarly, for even divisors, the product includes primes 2,3,5,7,11 with powers matching counts, so their lcm is at least 2^3*3^2*5*7*11 to accommodate counts.  

The minimal n to satisfy divisor counts is \( 2^3 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 11 = 8 * 9 * 5 * 7 * 11 = 8 * 9 * 5 * 7 * 11 = 8 * 9 * 5 * 77 = 8 * 9 * 385 = 8 * 3465 = 27720 \).

Thus, the minimal, closed-form \( n \) is:

<<<27720>>>

This is consistent with the pattern observed in enumerated solutions.
