The problem involves a chain of elements with specific multiplicative relations, and a sum equals 2023. Pattern suggests the chains involve numbers related by powers of 2 and 5, the key multiplicative factors.

Given the enumeration, the final chain likely involves numbers derived from powers of 2 and 5, or their linear combinations, summing to 2023.

From the pattern, the feasible chain elements are based on terms such as 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, etc. A natural minimal combination that sums to 2023 within such constraints hints towards a sequence of these growth steps.

Thus, the simple closed form summing these elements is 2023, matching previous sums hinting at two or three key elements to reach 2023 with these factors.

Based on this reasoning, a likely form of the answer would be the property that the sum of such a chain can be 2023 only for chains with structure involving powers/multiples of 2 and 5 that sum to 2023.

I hypothesize the answer is that the sum always equals a sum over terms which are powers or multiples of 2 and 5, specifically that the total sum is the sum of a finite geometric sequence involving powers of 2 and/or 5.

Final answer:

<<<∃ (a b c d e f : ℕ), a ≥ 0 ∧ b ≥ 0 ∧ c ≥ 0 ∧ d ≥ 0 ∧ e ≥ 0 ∧ f ≥ 0 ∧
   a * 1 + b * 2 + c * 5 + d * 10 + e * 25 + f * 50 = 2023>>>
