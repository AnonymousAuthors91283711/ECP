The problem involves counting functions from a 5-element type to Sym2(5), with restrictions. These constraints suggest each element maps to a non-diagonal transposition, and all transpositions are distinct, with exactly 2 elements per transposition. The total number of such functions corresponds to partitioning the 5 elements into pairs (blocks of size 2), leaving one leftover element, and assigning a unique transposition to each pair.

Pattern indicates total arrangements are product of choices: selecting 2 out of remaining elements for pairs, and assigning transpositions.

The final count combines the number of partitions into pairs with permutations, aligning with the double factorial for remnant.

Final expression: <<<15>>>
