The sum resembles a geometric series with ratio \( r = \frac{1}{z} \). Since \( z = 1 - 2i \), then \( S = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{n+1}{z^{n+1}} \). Using series summation formulas, the closed form simplifies to \(\frac{z}{(z-1)^2}\).  
Final answer:
<<<(z / (z - 1)^2)>>>
This expression is in ℂ and eliminates the sum explicitly.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The current error stems from referencing `z` directly in the definition of `omnimath523_answer`, which is outside the scope where `z` is defined. In Lean, to define an expression dependent on a variable (here, `z`), we must define it as a function of `z` rather than as a fixed constant. 

Given the sum S = ∑' n : ℕ, (n + 1) / z^(n + 1), the sum resembles a derivative of a geometric series:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+1) r^{n+1} = \frac{r}{(1 - r)^2}
\]

when replacing `r` with `1/z`, converging for suitable `z`.

Thus, the sum S can be expressed as:

\[
S = \frac{z}{(z - 1)^2}
\]

when considering the sum as a function of `z`. 

In Lean, this must be formalized as a lambda function, returning an expression in ℂ depending on an input `z`. The corrected answer accordingly:

<<<λ z : ℂ, z / (z - 1)^2>>>

This provides a closed form in terms of `z` and satisfies the requirements for a general answer, while fixing the previous errors related to scope and identifiers.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The main issue is the syntax used for defining the function `omnimath523_answer`. In Lean, to define a lambda (anonymous function), you should use `λ` followed by the argument, `=>`, then the body. Instead, the provided code uses a comma after `z : ℂ`, which is not correct in Lean syntax.

Furthermore, the form of the answer suggests a closed-form expression for the sum involving a geometric series derivative, which matches the sum `S = ∑' n : ℕ, (n + 1) / z^(n + 1)`. Recognizing that this sum is related to the derivatives of a geometric series, the sum evaluates to `z / (z - 1)^2`.

Here's the corrected version following lean syntax and logic, matching the form of standard geometric series sums:

```lean
<<<λ z : ℂ, z / (z - 1)^2>>> 
```

This defines `omnimath523_answer` as a function from `ℂ` to `ℂ`, producing the closed-form answer as a rational expression. It aligns with the geometric series derivative formula, matching the pattern in the enumerated solutions.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The heavy hint provided is the pattern in the enumerated answers, notably `z / (z - 1)^2`. The common pattern in complex power series and sums involving geometric series derivative indicates that this sum is likely a generating function or a sum of a derivative type.

The sum \( S = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{n+1}{z^{n+1}} \) (note the index is from 0 to ∞—common in power series) can be related to the sum \( \sum_{n=0}^\infty r^n = 1 / (1 - r) \), and its derivatives relate to sums involving \( n \).

Given \( z = 1 - 2i \), the sum resembles a generating function involving derivatives of geometric series, which results in \( z / (z-1)^2 \).

**Fixing the Lean code:**

- The `abbrev` syntax should directly define `omnimath523_answer` as a term of type `ℂ`. 
- The answer should be a term, not a lambda function with `z`.
- The code should be: `abbrev omnimath523_answer : ℂ := z / (z - 1)^2`, where `z` is the same as in the theorem's context.

**Therefore, the corrected code is:**

<<<z / (z - 1)^2>>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error occurs because `z` is used in the definition of `omnimath523_answer` before it is introduced as a variable or parameter in the scope of that definition. To fix this, `z` should be defined as a parameter of the abbreviation or in the context of the theorem, so that the implied variable is accessible in the expression. Since `z` is a given value in the theorem, the natural way is to parametrize `omnimath523_answer` as a function of `z`. 

The pattern from the enumerated answers suggests that the sum evaluates to a rational function involving `z` in a form similar to the sum of a geometric series or its derivatives: specifically, the sum of `(n+1)/z^(n+1)` from `n=0` to infinity converges to `z / (z - 1)^2`, provided `|z|>1`. 

Thus, I will define `omnimath523_answer` as a function of `z`, i.e., `z : ℂ → ℂ`, capturing the convergent sum in closed form: 

\[
\frac{z}{(z - 1)^2}
\]

This matches the pattern and makes it well-formed in Lean syntax.

<<<fun z : ℂ => z / (z - 1)^2>>>

This expression should compile as it is a well-formed function of `z : ℂ`, matching the expected answer type `ℂ`.
