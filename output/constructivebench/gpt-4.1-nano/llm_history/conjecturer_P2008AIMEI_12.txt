Based on pattern analysis and the enumerated answers, the final maximum M is obtained when v is just under the limit, resulting in the smallest minGap and the largest number of cars. The pattern suggests a maximal value close to the floor of (3600 * 15) / (carLength + 15), which simplifies to 3600 * 15 / (4 + 15). To avoid overcomplication, the answer is the maximum divisible approximation, giving:

<<<(3600 * 15) / (4 + 15)>>>
