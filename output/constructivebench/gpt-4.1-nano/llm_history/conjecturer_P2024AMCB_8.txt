    logb 2 x * logb 3 x = 2 * (logb 2 x + logb 3 x) ↔ x = P2024AMCB_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The equation \(\log_2 x \cdot \log_3 x = 2 (\log_2 x + \log_3 x)\) suggests a relation involving the logs. Let \(a = \log_2 x\) and \(b = \log_3 x\). Then \(x = 2^a = 3^b\). Using the change of base: \(b = \frac{\log_2 x}{\log_2 3} = a / \log_2 3\). Substituting in the equation gives a quadratic in \(a\). Solving yields the specific \(x\). Recognizing patterns, the solution simplifies to \(x = 6\).
