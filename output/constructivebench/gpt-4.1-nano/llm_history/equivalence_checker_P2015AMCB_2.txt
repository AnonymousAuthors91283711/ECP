abbrev P2015AMCB_2_answer : ℕ × ℕ → ℕ × ℕ := sorry
theorem P2015AMCB_2 : P2015AMCB_2_answer (13, 0) = (15, 30) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun (startHour, startMin) => 
    let startTime := startHour * 60 + startMin
    let endSecondTask := 14 * 60 + 40
    let duration := (endSecondTask - startTime) / 2
    let totalDuration := 3 * duration
    let finishTime := startTime + totalDuration
    (finishTime / 60, finishTime % 60)
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℕ × ℕ => (p.1 + 2, 3 * p.2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem appears to be about calculating the finish time of a task that takes 3 times the duration of half the time between start and 14:40.

2. Ground Truth Answer:
   - Correctly calculates the duration as half of (14:40 - start time)
   - Then calculates total duration as 3 times that
   - Finally computes finish time by adding to start time

3. Proposed Answer:
   - Simply adds 2 to the hour and multiplies minutes by 3
   - This doesn't account for the actual calculation logic
   - For (13,0) it gives (15,0) which differs from the correct (15,30)

The proposed answer is incorrect and doesn't match the ground truth calculation. It's not just a domain/constraint issue but a completely different (and wrong) approach.
