Ground Truth Answer: 111
Proposed Answer: 6^3 + 6^4 + 6^5
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

1. The problem asks for natural numbers a, b, c where:
   - a < b < c
   - b² = a*c (geometric progression)
   - b-a is a perfect square
   - log₆a + log₆b + log₆c = 6
   - a + b + c is the answer we're seeking

2. The ground truth answer is 111.

3. The proposed answer is 6³ + 6⁴ + 6⁵ = 216 + 1296 + 7776 = 9288.

4. The proposed answer (9288) is clearly different from the ground truth (111).

5. The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the logarithmic condition either:
   log₆(6³) + log₆(6⁴) + log₆(6⁵) = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 ≠ 6.
