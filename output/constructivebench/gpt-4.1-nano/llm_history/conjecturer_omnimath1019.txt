abbrev omnimath1019_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath1019 :
  (∑ a in range 8, ∑ b in range 8, ((a + 1) * (b + 1) % 8 : ℚ)) / 64 = omnimath1019_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The sum simplifies to the sum over all pairs (a, b) of (a + 1)(b + 1) mod 8 divided by 64. The double sum factors into the product of two identical sums over a, since the sum is symmetric. The sum of (a + 1) over a in range 8 is 36, and similarly for b, so the total sum for mod 8 residues averages to 36/8 = 9/2 for each variable, resulting in (36/8)^2 = 81/4. Dividing by 64 gives (81/4)/64 = 81/256. 

Final answer:

<<<(81 : ℚ) / 256>>>
