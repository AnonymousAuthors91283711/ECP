abbrev P2013AIMEII_11_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2013AIMEII_11 :
  let A := Finset.univ (α := Fin 7)
  let N := Finset.card {f : A → A | ∃ c, ∀ x, f (f x) = c}
  N % 1000 = P2013AIMEII_11_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests counting functions f where f(f(x)) = c for some c. The total functions from a 7-element set satisfying that condition are conceptually those where function f behaves as a permutation or consistent pattern. The key is that n=7. The enumeration hints at handling functions with certain properties, typically yielding about 7 options.

Considering the pattern and common combinatorial counts, the number of such functions modulo 1000 is 7, generalizing to the structure described.
