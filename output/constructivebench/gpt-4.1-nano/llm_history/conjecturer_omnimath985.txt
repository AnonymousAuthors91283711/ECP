Given (n^2 - 4) ≠ 0 and (n^3 + 8) divisible by (n^2 - 4), the constraints imply n ≠ ±2, and for divisibility, n must satisfy n^3 + 8 ≡ 0 mod n^2 - 4. Checking divisors, n ≠ ±2, and n = -2 satisfies the divisibility condition (since -8 + 8 = 0), avoiding n = 2. Therefore, the set contains all integers except 2 and 4. Since n = -2 satisfies the divisibility and the inequality

The main problem is that in Lean, the abbreviation 'omnimath985_answer' is defined using 'abbrev' without an explicit type or a proper value. Also, the current 'sorry' placeholder should be replaced with an explicit Set ℤ that captures the intended set of integers satisfying the divisibility condition, excluding those that violate the inequality.

From your reasoning and the pattern suggested, the set includes all integers except n=2 and n=-2 (since they make the denominator zero, violating the initial assumption) and possibly excludes other integers based on the divisibility constraint.

Given that, the set in question is all integers except ±2. This aligns with the divisibility condition, since for n=-2, (-2)^3 + 8 = (-8) +8=0, so 0 divisible by any non-zero integer, and (n^2 - 4) ≠ 0. For n=2, (2)^2 -4=0, which is excluded because division by zero is undefined.

Therefore, the answer set is: all integers except 2 and -2.

**Final Answer:**

<<<
{ n : ℤ | n ≠ 2 ∧ n ≠ -2 }
