: 4*x^2 - 3*x^2 = omnimath2906_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: (2)^2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us x = 2 and asks us to evaluate 4*x^2 - 3*x^2
2. Simplifying the expression: 4x² - 3x² = x²
3. Since x = 2, this becomes 2² = 4

The ground truth answer is 4, which is correct.

The proposed answer is (2)^2, which evaluates to 4.

While the forms are different (one is simplified, the other isn't), they represent the same value.
