The pattern suggests looking for elements where each collatz step increases the value beyond a₁, indicating a few small numbers likely satisfy the conditions. From enumeration, the minimal such a₁ is 1, where the steps yield 4 > 1, 2 > 1, 7 > 1. Larger numbers seem to fail as the chain doesn't satisfy the inequalities simultaneously. Since the problem bounds a₁ ≤ 2008 and all such numbers with this property are identity-wise equal to 1, the count is 1.
