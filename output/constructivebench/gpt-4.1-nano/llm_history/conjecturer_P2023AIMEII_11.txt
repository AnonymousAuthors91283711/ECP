Given the problem involves intersecting subsets with finite and cardinality conditions, the configuration resembles selecting 4 non-empty sets in a finite universe of size 5 where all intersect, avoiding disjoint pairs. The pattern suggests the maximum number of such sets is 16, corresponding to the binomial coefficient or combinational counts constrained by the size. The answer is therefore likely 16.
