The errors stem from using a set notation with a lambda pattern where Lean expects a predicate of type `(ℕ × ℕ) → Prop`. The current notation `{: | ...}` or `set (ℕ × ℕ)` expects a predicate function, not a set comprehension syntax with brace and vertical bar, which is more like set-builder notation used in mathematical texts.

In Lean, to define a set of pairs `(p, q)` satisfying a property, the correct approach is to define it as a `Set (ℕ × ℕ)` via a lambda function that maps each pair `(p, q)` to a `Prop`. For example:
```lean
def IMO2017SLN5_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ) := fun pq : ℕ × ℕ => pq.1 > pq.2 ∧ pq.1 - pq.2 = 1
```
Alternatively, with `set` notation:
```lean
def IMO2017SLN5_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ) := { pq | pq.1 > pq.2 ∧ pq.1 - pq.2 = 1 }
```
But when declaring `abbrev`, the syntax should be:
```lean
abbrev IMO2017SLN5_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ) := { pq | pq.1 > pq.2 ∧ pq.1 - pq.2 = 1 }
```

The errors also indicate that `'q'` is an unknown identifier in this context because in the set comprehension, the pair `(p, q)` should be used as a single variable, for instance `pq` or `(p, q)`, and not separate variables `'p'` and `'q'` unless `p` and `q` are introduced explicitly.

Given the above, the fixed version in Lean is:
```lean
abbrev IMO2017SLN5_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ) := { pq | pq.1 > pq.2 ∧ pq.1 - pq.2 = 1 }
```

This is the simplest corrected form that matches the original intended set, and resolves the syntax errors.

The key issue is attempting to define IMO2017SLN5_answer with `def` inside an `abbrev` or `theorem` context—this is syntactically invalid in Lean. To define a constant set, use `constant` or `def` outside of these blocks. Here, since the goal is an abstract set of pairs (p, q) with the property that p and q are primes satisfying p > q and p - q = 1, the correct approach is to define it as a `constant` of type `Set (ℕ × ℕ)`.

Given the enumerated pattern (pairs of primes with difference 1), the most straightforward closed-form statement is:

- IMO2017SLN5_answer is the set of all pairs (p, q) such that p and q are primes, p > q, and p − q = 1.

The fix is to declare this as a `constant`, not as an `abbrev` or with an inner `def`. So, the correct approximation is:

```lean
constant IMO2017SLN5_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ) := 
  { pq | pq.1 > pq.2 ∧ pq.1 - pq.2 = 1 ∧ Prime pq.1 ∧ Prime pq.2 }
```

This set captures all pairs of primes with difference 1, aligning with the enumeration of prime pairs differing by 1.

The main issue in your current code is the misuse of the keyword `constant` when defining `IMO2017SLN5_answer` as an abbreviation. In Lean, `abbrev` declarations do not require `constant`. Also, the overall syntax needs to be corrected to conform to Lean syntax, especially for set comprehension.

Based on the enumerated answer pattern, it appears that the answer set `IMO2017SLN5_answer` consists of pairs `(p, q)` where `p` and `q` are primes, with `p > q`, and possibly satisfying additional constraints such as `p - q = 1`, i.e., consecutive primes. The hint suggests a simple explicit characterization, typically in such problems.

Here's a plausible set definition aligned with typical solutions to such prime-related problems, incorporating the pattern of primes `p` and `q` where `p - q = 1` and both are prime, over the set of pairs:

```lean
<<<{ pq | prime pq.1 ∧ prime pq.2 ∧ pq.1 > pq.2 ∧ pq.1 - pq.2 = 1 }>>>
```

This captures the typical "twin primes" or "consecutive primes" in which the conjecture is that the answer set consists precisely of pairs of primes differing by 1, with `p > q`.

The correction ensures:
- Use of `abbrev` without an unnecessary `constant`.
- Correct syntax for set comprehension: `{ pq | ... }`.
- The set describes pairs `(p, q)` with explicit prime and difference conditions, matching expected prime-related structures.

In summary, the fixed Lean definition is:

```lean
abbrev IMO2017SLN5_answer : set (ℕ × ℕ) := 
  { pq | prime pq.1 ∧ prime pq.2 ∧ pq.1 > pq.2 ∧ pq.1 - pq.2 = 1 }

The primary issue is that in Lean, the syntax `<<< ... >>>` is not valid for raw code or set definitions. To define a set of pairs satisfying certain properties, we should use a set comprehension with `Set` constructors like `Set.ofList` or more idiomatically, define it via `Set` notation using `filter` (i.e., `{ p | ... }`). 

Given the enumerated answer, the pattern indicates pairs `(p,q)` with `p` and `q` prime, `p > q`, and `p - q = 1`, i.e., consecutive primes. The set can be expressed as pairs `(p,q)` with `p > q` prime and satisfying `p - q = 1`. 

In Lean, using `Set` comprehension, the correct syntax for the answer set is:
```lean
{ pq | prime pq.1 ∧ prime pq.2 ∧ pq.1 > pq.2 ∧ pq.1 - pq.2 = 1 }
```

Therefore, the fixed code is:

<<<
{ pq | prime pq.1 ∧ prime pq.2 ∧ pq.1 > pq.2 ∧ pq.1 - pq.2 = 1 }
>>>

This correctly defines the set of ordered pairs `(p,q)` of consecutive primes with `p > q`.
