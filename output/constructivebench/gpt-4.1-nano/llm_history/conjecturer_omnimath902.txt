The set involves solutions to x + y^2 = xy with y > 0, implying x = y^2 / (y - 1) (for y ≠ 1). Since y > 0 and the function y ↦ y^2 / (y - 1) is decreasing for y > 1 and increasing for 0 < y < 1, the infimum occurs at y approaching 1 from above, where x tends to +∞, or at y approaching 1 from below, where x tends to -∞. For y approaching infinity, x tends to y, so the lower bound is -∞. The set of solutions spans all real numbers less than or equal to 0, with infimum approaching 0 from below. 

Final answer: <<<0>>>
