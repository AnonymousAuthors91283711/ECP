theorem P2008AMCA_12 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (f_dom : ∀ x, x ∈ Icc 0 2 ↔ f x ∈ Icc 0 1) :

Ground Truth Answer: (Icc (-1) 1, Icc 0 1)
Proposed Answer: (Icc 0 1, Icc 1 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a function g(x) = 1 - f(x+1) where f maps from [0,2] to [0,1].
2. The first component of the answer should be the set of x where x+1 ∈ [0,2], which is indeed [-1,1] (Icc (-1) 1).
3. The second component is the range of g. Since f(x+1) ∈ [0,1], g(x) = 1 - f(x+1) will range from [0,1] (when f(x+1) goes from 1 to 0).

The ground truth answer correctly captures both components:
- First component: Icc (-1) 1 (correct)
- Second component: Icc 0 1 (correct)

The proposed answer has:
- First component: Icc 0 1 (incorrect, should be [-1,1])
- Second component: Icc 1 2 (incorrect, should be [0,1])
