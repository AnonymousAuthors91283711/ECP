Given that the roots \( \alpha_i \) are the four distinct roots of \( z^4 + 2z^3 + 2=0 \), and analyzing the symmetric sums, all three expressions evaluate to the same explicit value. The pattern suggests the set contains the single complex number \( -1 \).

The failed token is due to the use of LaTeX inline math (\( ... \)) inside a Lean comment or abbrev, which Lean does not parse. To fix this, eliminate the LaTeX math delimiters in the comment and write the explanation entirely in plain text. The problem suggests that the roots of the polynomial \(z^4 + 2z^3 + 2=0\) are distinct and symmetric sums lead to the conclusion that all involved expressions equal -1, hence the set is \{-1\}. Therefore, the answer set is the singleton \{-1\}. 

Given the symmetry and the form of the roots, all three expressions evaluate identically to -1, so the set contains just -1.
