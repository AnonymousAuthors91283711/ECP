  HasSum (fun n : ℕ => (1 : ℚ) / ((n + 3)^2 + (n + 1))) omnimath1314_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The sum resembles a telescoping series after partial fraction decomposition; it converges to 1/2 based on analysis of the tail behavior and known summation patterns. 

<<<(1 / 2 : ℚ)>>>
