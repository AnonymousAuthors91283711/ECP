theorem P2010AMCB_23 :
  ∃ (P Q : ℝ[X]), 
    P.Monic ∧ Q.Monic ∧ 
    degree P = 2 ∧ degree Q = 2 ∧
    (P.comp Q).roots = { -23, -21, -17, -15 } ∧
    (Q.comp P).roots = { -59, -57, -51, -49 } ∧
    (let pmin := P.eval (-P.coeff 1 / 2)
     let qmin := Q.eval (-Q.coeff 1 / 2)
     pmin + qmin = P2010AMCB_23_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The root sets are symmetric and suggest quadratic polynomials with roots centered around the sums -16 and -54, as these are sums of pairs of roots (e.g., -23 + (-15) = -38). Observing the pattern and the symmetry, the sum pmin + qmin approximates to -34, which arises from averaging certain roots related to P and Q. Thus, the answer is the sum of these evaluations, giving a specific real number approximately equal to -34. 

Final answer:
<<<-34>>>
