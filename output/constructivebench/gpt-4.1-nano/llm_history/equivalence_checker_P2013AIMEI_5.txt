Ground Truth Answer: (81, 16, 3)
Proposed Answer: (27, 64, 7)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for positive integers a, b, c such that:
   - The expression (a^(1/3) + b^(1/3) + 1)/c is a root of 8x³ - 3x² - 3x - 1 = 0
   - a + b + c = 98

2. Ground Truth Answer (81, 16, 3):
   - 81 + 16 + 3 = 100 ≠ 98 (This appears incorrect, but let's check the proposed answer)
   - Wait, this contradicts the problem statement. Maybe the ground truth is incorrect?

3. Proposed Answer (27, 64, 7):
   - 27 + 64 + 7 = 98 (satisfies the sum condition)
   - 27^(1/3) = 3, 64^(1/3) = 4
   - (3 + 4 + 1)/7 = 8/7
   - Plugging into polynomial: 8*(8/7)³ - 3*(8/7)² - 3*(8/7) - 1 ≈ 9.34 - 3.92 - 3.43 - 1 ≈ 0.99 ≈ 1 (not exactly 0, but close)

The ground truth answer doesn't satisfy a+b+c=98, while the proposed answer does and comes close to satisfying the polynomial equation (though not exactly). This suggests the ground truth might be incorrect or there might be a typo in the problem statement.
