theorem omnimath1126 (p : ℝ) (hp : 0 ≤ p ∧ p ≤ 1) :
  (Nat.choose 4 2 * p^2 * (1 - p)^2 = Nat.choose 4 3 * p^3 * (1 - p)) ↔ p = omnimath1126_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests solving the equation involving binomial coefficients and polynomial powers of p, often resulting in a quadratic in p. Given the symmetry in p^2(1-p)^2 and p^3(1-p), the solution points to a specific p value within [0, 1], likely the boundary or a critical point of the quadratic. The expression simplifies at p = 1/2, and matching the pattern from enumerated answers indicates the answer is p = 2/3, which satisfies the given relation.
