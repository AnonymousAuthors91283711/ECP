Ground Truth Answer: 112
Proposed Answer: 4
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence modulo 11 and asks for the product of three specific terms (2018, 2020, 2022) of this sequence.

2. The ground truth answer is 112.

3. The proposed answer is 4.

Analysis:
- Since all operations are modulo 11, the final product should be considered modulo 11.
- 112 mod 11 = 2 (since 11×10=110, 112-110=2)
- 4 mod 11 = 4
- 2 ≠ 4, so the answers are not equivalent.

However, there's a possibility that the proposed answer is giving just the last term (aime_sequence 2022 = 4) rather than the product. But the problem clearly asks for the product of three terms.
