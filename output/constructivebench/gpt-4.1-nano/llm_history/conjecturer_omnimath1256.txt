theorem omnimath1256 :
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 1000 < n ∧ n < 2000 ∧ ∀ k ∈ ({2,3,4,5,6,7,8} : Set ℕ), n % k = 1} omnimath1256_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the answer is the smallest number greater than 1000, less than 2000, and congruent to 1 modulo all 2 through 8. The least common multiple of 2..8 is 840; smallest n > 1000 with n % 840 = 1 is 1001.  
Final answer: <<<1001>>>.
