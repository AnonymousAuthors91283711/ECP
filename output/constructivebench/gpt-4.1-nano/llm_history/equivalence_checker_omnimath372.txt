abbrev omnimath372_answer : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ → Bool := sorry
theorem omnimath372 (v e f : ℕ) : 
  (v - e + f = 2) ↔ omnimath372_answer (v, e, f) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun (v, e, f) => v - e + f = 2
Proposed Answer: fun t => match t with | (v, e, f) => v - e + f = 2
<<<True>>>

The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both are functions that take a triple (v, e, f) and return whether v - e + f equals 2. The proposed answer just uses pattern matching syntax to destructure the tuple, while the ground truth answer uses direct tuple parameter binding. The behavior is identical in both cases.
