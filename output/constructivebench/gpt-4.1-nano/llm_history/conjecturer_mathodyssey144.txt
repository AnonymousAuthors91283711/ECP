The condition restricts the set s to be subsets of [1..100] with pairwise gcd/lcm ratios not forming a perfect square, and aims for the greatest such n. Intuitively, to maximize n, pick s as the largest subset with all elements satisfying the condition, likely all numbers from 1 to 100, because adding more numbers tends to create pairs with divisible structure. The pattern suggests the answer approaches the total count of such elements, with the maximum n being 100.
