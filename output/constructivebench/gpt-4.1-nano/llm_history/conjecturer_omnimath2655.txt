The product is positive if all factors are either all positive or all negative, meaning n is far from the roots 1001, 2001, 2002, 3001, 3002, 3003. To find the minimal absolute value of the number, d, this occurs when n is just outside these roots, so the minimal is 1 for the closest root distance. Since the minimal distance to any root is 1, the digit length of that abs value is 1 for all such minimal cases.
