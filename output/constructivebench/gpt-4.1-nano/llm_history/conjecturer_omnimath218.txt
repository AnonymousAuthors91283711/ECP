  min (sqrt (x + x * y * z)) (min (sqrt (y + x * y * z)) (sqrt (z + x * y * z))) = 
  sqrt (x - 1) + sqrt (y - 1) + sqrt (z - 1) ↔ 
  ∃ c > 1, (x, y, z) = omnimath218_answer c := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ × ℝ × ℝ
Based on the pattern and the enumerations, the answer involves symmetry and the relation between the variables and the parameter c. The minimal expressions suggest that x, y, z relate to c via x = y = z = c, and the equality simplifies to the sum of the square roots of (c - 1). The answer is thus a triplet each equal to c, which satisfies the relation.
