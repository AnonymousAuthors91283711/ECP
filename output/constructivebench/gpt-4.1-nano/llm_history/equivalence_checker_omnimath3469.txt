abbrev omnimath3469_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3469 (x y z : ℝ) 
  (h1 : x = 0.2 * y) 
  (h2 : x = 0.5 * z) : 
  z = (omnimath3469_answer / 100) * y := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 40
Proposed Answer: 0.8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. From h1: x = 0.2*y
2. From h2: x = 0.5*z
3. Setting them equal: 0.2*y = 0.5*z
4. Solving for z: z = (0.2/0.5)*y = 0.4*y

The ground truth answer is 40, which means the equation would be z = (40/100)*y = 0.4*y, matching our derivation.

The proposed answer is 0.8, which would make the equation z = (0.8/100)*y = 0.008*y, which is incorrect.
