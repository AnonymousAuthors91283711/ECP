abbrev omnimath3027_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3027 :
  Real.sqrt ((Real.sqrt 81 + Real.sqrt 81) / 2) = omnimath3027_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The expression involves taking the square root of the average of two identical square roots, both equal to sqrt(81)=9. The mean is (9+9)/2=9, and its square root is sqrt(9)=3. Hence, the answer is 3.
