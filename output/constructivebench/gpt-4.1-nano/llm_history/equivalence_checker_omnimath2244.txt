Ground Truth Answer: {(12, 13, 57)}
Proposed Answer: singleton (8, 7, 71)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all positive integer triples (x,y,z) that satisfy:
   - x² + y - z = 100
   - x + y² - z = 124

2. Ground truth answer gives (12,13,57)
   - Checking: 12² + 13 - 57 = 144 + 13 - 57 = 100 ✔
   - 12 + 13² - 57 = 12 + 169 - 57 = 124 ✔

3. Proposed answer gives (8,7,71)
   - Checking: 8² + 7 - 71 = 64 + 7 - 71 = 0 ≠ 100 ✖
   - 8 + 7² - 71 = 8 + 49 - 71 = -14 ≠ 124 ✖

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy either equation, while the ground truth does. They are clearly different solutions.
