theorem P2013AIMEII_3 :
  let totalTime := ∑ k in Finset.range 119, 10 * (k + 1)
  let halfTime := totalTime / 2
  let heightAtHalfTime := 119 - (Finset.card {k ∈ Finset.range 119 | ∑ i in Finset.range k, 10 * (i + 1) ≤ halfTime})

Ground Truth Answer: 35
Proposed Answer: 300
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating a height at half-time of a process where each step takes 10*(k+1) seconds for k from 0 to 118 (total 119 steps).

2. The total time is ∑(k=1 to 119) of 10k = 10*(119*120)/2 = 71400 seconds. Half time is 35700 seconds.

3. We need to find how many steps can be completed by half-time. The sum of first n steps is 5n(n+1). Solving 5n(n+1) ≤ 35700 gives n ≈ 84. So 84 steps are completed by half-time, leaving 119-84 = 35 steps remaining.

4. The height is 10 times remaining steps: 10*35 = 350.

The ground truth answer is 35 (likely representing remaining steps), while the proposed answer is 300. Neither matches the correct calculation of 350, and they don't match each other.
