  (hburgers : burgers = 5)
  (hsides : sides = 3)
  (hdrinks : drinks = 12) :
  (burgers * sides * drinks = omnimath2414_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests multiplying fixed values: burgers = 5, sides = 3, drinks = 12, and their product 5 * 3 * 12 = 180.  
Final answer: <<<180>>>
