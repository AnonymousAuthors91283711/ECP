Given the pattern of non-square products and sums involved, the final condition essentially asserts that there do not exist positive integers with product squares. This aligns with the fact that sum-of-two-squares representations do not imply the product is a square unless trivial cases. Therefore, the formula expresses a property that is always false when both products are squares, and true otherwise. The most concise closed form is the negation of the existence of such squares, represented as a universal statement:  

<<<¬∃ x y z t : ℕ, 0 < x ∧ 0 < y ∧ 0 < z ∧ 0 < t ∧ x * y = z * t ∧ IsSquare (x * y) ∧ IsSquare (z * t)>>>
