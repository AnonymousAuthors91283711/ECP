Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 1 - (sin (2^2011 * x))^2 / (4^2011 * (sin x)^2)
Proposed Answer: fun x => 2 ^ 2011 * (sin x) ^ 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves a summation of trigonometric terms with powers of 2, and the ground truth answer shows a pattern where the general term for n is 1 - (sin(2^(n+1)*x))^2/(4^(n+1)*(sin x)^2).

2. The ground truth answer follows this pattern consistently for n=2010 (which gives 2011 terms in the sum).

3. The proposed answer is completely different - it's a simple expression involving 2^2011 * (sin x)^2, which doesn't match the pattern or structure of the ground truth answer.

4. There's no apparent transformation or simplification that would make these two expressions equivalent.
