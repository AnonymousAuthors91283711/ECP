Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1006), (3, 331), (11, 31)}
Proposed Answer: { (a, b) | a ∣ 2013 ∧ a > 0 ∧ b = (2013 - a^3) / (2 * a) ∧ (2013 - a^3) % (2 * a) = 0 }

The proposed answer is mostly correct in terms of the mathematical expressions and conditions, but it's not equivalent to the ground truth answer. The ground truth answer provides explicit solutions (specific pairs (a,b)), while the proposed answer gives a general condition that all solutions must satisfy. The proposed answer would need to be evaluated for all divisors of 2013 to obtain the same explicit solutions as the ground truth answer. The conditions in the proposed answer are correct, but it's not in the same form as the ground truth answer.
