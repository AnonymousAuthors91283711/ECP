Based on the pattern and the properties of such divisibility assertions, the number n must be a power of 13, as the polynomial x^13 - x is divisible by n for positive integers x, which suggests n divides all such differences. The minimal such n > 1 is 13 itself, including all powers of 13.

The problem involves analyzing the divisibility of the polynomial x^13 - x for integer x > 0. Since x^13 - x factors over ℤ as x(x^12 - 1), and because x^12 - 1 is divisible by 13 for all x coprime to 13, we deduce that 13 divides x^13 - x for all positive x—this is consistent with Fermat's little theorem.

Furthermore, because x^13 - x is divisible by 13 for all positive integers x, and the expression holds uniformly, the minimal such n satisfying the condition is 13 itself. Powers of 13 are also divisible, but the minimal positive integer greater than 1 that divides x^13 - x for all positive x is simply 13.

Hence, the answer is 13.

To fix the Lean code, assign the answer directly as 13, enclosing it within the delimiter as instructed.
