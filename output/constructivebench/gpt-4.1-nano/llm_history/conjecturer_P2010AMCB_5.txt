  1 - (2 - (3 - (4 + e))) = 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 + e ↔ e = P2010AMCB_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℤ
Given the pattern of the expression, the equation simplifies to a sum of negatives: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 + e. To match both sides, e must offset the sum of negatives, which is -(2+3+4) = -9. Adding 1, the total is 1 - 9 = -8. The simplified answer is -8.
