The answer characterizes the smallest positive integer n for which no multiple belongs to the set defined by sums of 2^a(i). Since sums can create all numbers with binary representations up to certain limits, the minimal "bad" number is 1, the smallest positive integer, because 1 cannot be expressed as multiple of any other number's sum of powers of 2.
