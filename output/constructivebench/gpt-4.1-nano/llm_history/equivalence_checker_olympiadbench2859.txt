theorem olympiadbench2859 (T : ℕ) :
  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | let k := 21 + 2 * T;
                     let f := fun n => 2 * n^2 - k * n + 77;
                     f n > 0 ∧ Nat.Prime (f n)} (olympiadbench2859_answer T) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun T => 12  -- The answer is constant regardless of T
Proposed Answer: fun T => 21 + 2 * T
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the greatest natural number n such that:
   - f(n) = 2n² - (21 + 2T)n + 77 is positive
   - f(n) is prime

2. The ground truth answer is a constant function returning 12 for any T.

3. The proposed answer is a linear function 21 + 2T.

Analysis:
- The proposed answer grows linearly with T, while the ground truth is constant.
- For T=0: ground truth gives n=12 (f(12)=2*144-21*12+77=149 which is prime), proposed gives n=21 (f(21)=77 which is not prime)
- For T=1: ground truth still gives n=12 (f(12)=125 which is not prime - this suggests the ground truth might be incomplete), proposed gives n=23 (f(23)=575 which is not prime)
- The ground truth seems incorrect for T=1, but the proposed answer is clearly wrong as it doesn't satisfy the conditions for any T.

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect.
