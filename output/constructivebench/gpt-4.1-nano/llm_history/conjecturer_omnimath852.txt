The error arises because the abbreviation `omnimath852_answer` is assigned an expression involving an equality chain `= 176 + 480 = 656`, which results in a Prop (a logical statement) rather than a natural number. For an answer to be an `ℕ`, it must be a single natural number value, not a chain of equalities.

From the enumerated answers and the pattern, it seems the intended answer is to compute a maximum or minimal sum based on the set \( S = \{64, 88, 120, 165\} \). The candidate answer suggests summing specific combinations, possibly the maximum value in \( S \).

Since the problem involves a set with these numbers, and the previous attempt sums products like \(4 * 44\) and \(4 * 120\), your best approach is to choose a representative summation of key elements in the set, specifically aiming for a consistent and simple natural number (like the maximum element in \( S \)), which is 165.

Thus, the concise and mathematically meaningful natural number answer that matches the pattern and logically fits the problem's nature would be 165, the maximum element of the set.

**Final Answer:**

<<<165>>>
