The pattern suggests solving the linear system for (b, j, s) and finding their squares sum. From enumeration, the consistent answer that fits the pattern is b = 5, j=14, s=8, and their squares sum is 405. 

Final answer in Lean: 
<<<b^2 + j^2 + s^2>>>

which equals:

The errors indicate that the identifiers b, j, s are not in scope within the abbreviation definition. An abbreviation in Lean cannot directly reference variables from the theorem context; it must be a definition based on concrete values or a construct that does not depend on such variables directly. 

Given the constraints, and considering that the problem asks to find an explicit value of b, j, s satisfying the equations, the typical approach is to solve the linear system:

2b + 3j + 4s = 74  
4b + 2j + 3s = 91

which can be done via algebraic methods (e.g., elimination or substitution). Once b, j, s are known, their squares are fixed, and the sum is a specific natural number.

From solving the system, for example:

- Multiply the first equation by 2:

4b + 6j + 8s = 148

- Subtract the second equation:

(4b + 6j + 8s) - (4b + 2j + 3s) = 148 - 91 → (4b - 4b) + (6j - 2j) + (8s - 3s) = 57

→ 4j + 5s = 57

From this, solve for j:

j = (57 - 5s)/4

Plug into the first original equation:

2b + 3((57 - 5s)/4) + 4s = 74

Multiply through by 4:

8b + 3(57 - 5s) + 16s = 296

8b + 171 - 15s + 16s = 296

8b + 171 + s = 296

⇒ 8b + s = 125

Express s:

s = 125 - 8b

Now substitute s into j:

j = (57 - 5(125 - 8b))/4

= (57 - 625 + 40b)/4

= (-568 + 40b)/4

= -142 + 10b

All variables should be non-negative integers; hence, choose b so that S, j, s are integers and non-negative:

s = 125 - 8b ≥ 0 ⇒ b ≤ 15

j = -142 + 10b ≥ 0 ⇒ 10b ≥ 142 ⇒ b ≥ 14.2

b integer, so b ≥ 15

b ≤ 15, b ≥ 15, so b=15

Then,

s = 125 - 8×15 = 125 - 120 = 5

j = -142 + 10×15 = -142 + 150 = 8

Check non-negativity: yes.

Verify the equations:

2b + 3j + 4s = 2×15 + 3×8 + 4×5 = 30 + 24 + 20 = 74 ✓

4b + 2j + 3s = 4×15 + 2×8 + 3×5 = 60 + 16 + 15 = 91 ✓

Squares sum:

b² + j² + s² = 15² + 8² + 5² = 225 + 64 + 25 = 314

Hence, the sum is 314.

Finally, the code should be an expression: just the number 314, since it is the sum of squares at this solution.

Therefore, the answer in Lean is 314.

The corrected code:

<<<314>>>

This provides a concrete answer for the sum of squares based on the solution.

Explanation:

- Variables b, j, s are determined explicitly via algebraic methods, then their squares summed.
- As the problem asks for a closed-form answer, and the sum is fixed at 314 for this particular solution, the answer should be the number 314.
- Due to the scope issues, defining an abbreviation with the explicit sum is most straightforward.
