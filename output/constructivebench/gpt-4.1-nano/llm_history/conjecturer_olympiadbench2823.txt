theorem olympiadbench2823 :
  ∃ (d : ℕ), (let a := fun n => 10 + (n - 1) * d;
    a (a 2) = 100 ∧ a (a (a 3)) = olympiadbench2823_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern in the enumerated answers, the sequence a(n) is an arithmetic sequence with initial term 10 and common difference d. The conditions involve iterated applications, leading to the conclusion that a(2) = 10 + d, and a(a(2)) = 100 implies 10 + 2d = 100, giving d = 45. Then, a(3) = 10 + 2*45 = 100, and further iterated applications yield a(100) = 10 + 99 * 45.  
Final answer:

<<<10 + 99 * 45>>>
