theorem omnimath4272 (n : ℕ) (hn : n > 0) :
  (∃ m, ∑ d ∈ divisors n, d = 2^m) → omnimath4272_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → Prop
The pattern suggests the answer involves expressing the sum over divisors of n as a power of two, indicating n is a power of two. Thus, the property simplifies to n being exactly a power of two.
