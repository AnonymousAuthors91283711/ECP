The enumeration pattern suggests summing over triplets with i + j + k = 17, summing i * j * k. The sums are symmetric, and the total is the multinomial coefficient sum. Recognizing this, the sum equals \(\frac{17 \times 18 \times 19}{6}\). This simplifies to the binomial coefficient sum for partitions.

The proposed answer pattern indicates summing over all triplets (i, j, k) with i + j + k = 17, multiplying i * j * k, which is symmetric. Recognizing this, the sum over all such triplets corresponds to the coefficient counting the contributions of these triplets.

The sum \(\sum_{i+j+k=17} i j k \) over non-negative integers i, j, k with i + j + k = 17 can be computed using symmetry and combinatorial identities. Since the sum is symmetric in i, j, k, one can express it as:

\[
\sum_{i+j+k=17} i j k = 3! \times \text{average of } i j k \text{ over permutations}
\]

Alternatively, it can be derived that this sum is equal to:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \times 17 \times 18 \times 19
\]

which is the product of the three consecutive integers from 17 to 19 divided by 6.

Based on this, the final answer in Lean should be:

```lean
<<<(17 * 18 * 19) / 6>>>
```

This form gives a closed-form, symmetric, and correct value for the sum of i * j * k over all triplets summing to 17.

**Final Answer:**

<<<(17 * 18 * 19) / 6>>>

**Explanation:**
- The enumerations suggest summing i*j*k over i + j + k = 17.
- The sum of i*j*k equals \(\frac{17 \times 18 \times 19}{6}\).
- The formula accounts for all permutations, symmetric in i, j, k.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The current proposed answer `<<(17 * 18 * 19) / 6>>>` uses Lean syntax errors—specifically, the '<<<' delimiters are invalid outside of quote expressions or comments. Since `abbrev omnimath1250_answer : ℕ :=` must assign a value, we should exclude these delimiters.

Furthermore, given the symmetry of the sum over triples `(i, j, k)` with `i + j + k = 17`, the sum is analogous to summing `i * j * k` over all such ordered triples. The sum over all permutations can be expressed via a multinomial coefficient or generating function techniques, but a simple direct approach is to relate it to the elementary symmetric sums.

Analyzing the enumeration, the sum of `i + j + k = 17`, with `i, j, k` in `[0, 16]`, suggests the sum over all such triples of `i * j * k` can be simplified to a known combinatorial expression. The sum over triples of `i * j * k` with fixed sum is a standard combinatorial sum:

\[ \sum_{i + j + k = n} i j k \]

This sum is known to be:

\[ \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6} \]

when summing `i, j, k` over all non-negative integers with sum `n`, considering the symmetry and multinomial coefficient, possibly scaled.

Alternatively, from enumerated answers, the pattern is similar to the binomial coefficient for choosing 3 elements with repetitions, involving the formula:

\[ \binom{n+2}{2} \]

which counts the number of multisets of size 3 from `n+1` elements, but we need the sum of products. Since the provided answer is `(17 * 18 * 19) / 6`, which equals `969`, this pattern resembles the sum over all `(i, j, k)` with `i + j + k = 17` of `i j k`.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

\[ \frac{17 \times 18 \times 19}{6} \]

which simplifies to 969.

Final fixed code in Lean:

```lean
abbrev omnimath1250_answer : ℕ := (17 * 18 * 19) / 6
```

This expression is a normative closed-form and matches the enumerated pattern.

<<<(17 * 18 * 19) / 6>>>
