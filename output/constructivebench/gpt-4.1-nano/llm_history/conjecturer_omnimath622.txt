The pattern indicates the answer involves the discriminant \(b^2 - 4ac\), which distinguishes the parabola's roots. Since the roots have specified conditions, the greatest \(d\) satisfying the conditions involves maximizing the discriminant so that real roots are distinct and meet the given values. The maximum discriminant considering the points with \(f(u)=0, f(v)=0, f(w)=2\) is achieved when the parabola has roots corresponding to \(u,v,w\). Because \(d = b^2 - 4ac\), the maximum value is unbounded in general, but constrained by the points’ conditions, leading to the highest discriminant at the specific points. 

Since for three distinct roots with \(f(u)=0\), \(f(v)=0\) and \(f(w)=2\), the maximal \(d\) is when the parabola is symmetric with roots at \(u,v\) and passing through \(w\),

The maximal discriminant occurs at \(d = 4\), which corresponds to the parabola with roots that yield \(f(w)=2\). 

Thus, the answer is:

<<<(4 : ℤ)>>>
