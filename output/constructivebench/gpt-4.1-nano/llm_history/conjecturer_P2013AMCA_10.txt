(S : Set ℕ)
(hS : S = {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∃ a b : ℕ, a ≠ b ∧ (1 : ℚ) / n = a / 10 ^ 1 + b / 10 ^ 2 + (∑' k : ℕ, a / 10 ^ (2 * k + 3) + b / 10 ^ (2 * k + 4))})

The sum involves the decimal expansion of 1/n as a sum of two digits a and b plus an infinite tail. The pattern suggests that n corresponds to a decimal number 0.a b + tail, with constraints on a, b, and the tail. The structure implies n = 10a + b with possible contributions from the tail term as a geometric series. The sum over all such n with these decimal representations results in a sum equivalent to a predictable series involving powers of 10.

Final answer:

<<<(7 * 10 ^ 2 - 7)>>>
