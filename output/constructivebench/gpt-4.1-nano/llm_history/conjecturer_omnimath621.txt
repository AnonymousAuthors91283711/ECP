The pattern suggests the solutions are expressions involving simple factors like 1 or -1. The given constraints imply H, M, T satisfy \(H M^2 T = H + 2 M + T\). To find the maximal \(x = H M^2 T\), consider minimal values of \(H, T\) to maximize \(x\). Testing H, T ∈ ℤ with E.g., H = T = 1 yields \(M^2 = 1 + 2 M + 1\Rightarrow M^2 = 2 + 2 M\). Solving, M = 1 maximizes the value with the corresponding \(x=H M^2 T=1·1·1=1\). For negative values, choose H=T=-1: similar reasoning yields \(x=-1\). Due to the symmetry and the capacity for unbounded solutions, the maximum is 4 when H=2, T=2, M=1: \(2 * 1^2 * 2=4\). 

Therefore, the greatest such value is 4.

<<<4>>>
