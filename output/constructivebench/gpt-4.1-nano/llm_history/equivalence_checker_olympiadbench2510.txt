abbrev olympiadbench2510_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2510 :
  let p (x : ℕ) := logb 100 (1 + 1 / x)
  let S := Finset.Icc 81 99
  ∑ x in S, p x = 2 * p olympiadbench2510_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 9
Proposed Answer: 81
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves summing logarithmic terms from x=81 to x=99 and relating this sum to twice a single logarithmic term evaluated at some answer.

2. The key observation is that the terms in the sum pair up in a way that (1 + 1/x) * (1 + 1/(100-x)) = (x+1)/x * (101-x)/(100-x) = (101-x)/x * (x+1)/(100-x) = (101-x)(x+1)/(x(100-x)) = (100x + 101 - x² - x)/(100x - x²) = (-x² + 99x + 101)/(-x² + 100x)

This doesn't immediately simplify to a clean cancellation, suggesting the pairing might not be straightforward.

3. The ground truth answer is 9, while the proposed answer is 81. These are clearly different numbers, and 81 is actually the starting point of the summation range.

4. The correct answer should be such that the product of all terms (1 + 1/x) from x=81 to 99 equals (1 + 1/answer)². Through calculation, this works out to be 9, not 81.
