  {k : ℕ | k ≥ 2 ∧ ∀ m ∈ Set.Icc 1 k, ∀ n ∈ Set.Icc 1 k, m ≠ n → ¬(k ∣ (n ^ (n - 1) - m ^ (m - 1)))} = omnimath3856_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests the largest such \( k \) is 2 because for any \( k \ge 3 \), counterexamples exist, but for \( k=2 \), the property is trivially satisfied.  

Hence, the only set with such \( k \) is {2}.
