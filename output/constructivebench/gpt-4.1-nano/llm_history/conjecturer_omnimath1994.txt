Given the polynomial's structure, the roots include rational solutions achieved via substitution y = x^3. The rational roots of the polynomial suggest y = 1 or y = -1, corresponding to x^3 = 1 and x^3 = -1, hence roots x = 1, x = -1, and complex roots from the factorization. The real roots are x = 1 and x = -1, as the other roots are complex. Therefore, the set of solutions is exactly { -1, 1 }.
