Ground Truth Answer: Icc (-9/2) (-2) ∪ Ioo ((1 - sqrt 5)/2) ((1 + sqrt 5)/2)
Proposed Answer: { x : ℝ | x < -9/2 } ∪ { x : ℝ | x > -2 }
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is solving the inequality (x+1)/(x+2) > (3x+4)/(2x+9) for x ≠ -2 and x ≠ -9/2.

2. The ground truth answer correctly identifies three intervals:
   - Between -9/2 and -2 (Icc (-9/2) (-2))
   - Between (1-√5)/2 and (1+√5)/2 (Ioo ((1 - sqrt 5)/2) ((1 + sqrt 5)/2))

3. The proposed answer suggests two intervals:
   - x < -9/2
   - x > -2

The proposed answer is missing:
- The interval between -9/2 and -2 where the inequality holds
- The interval around the golden ratio ((1±√5)/2) where the inequality also holds

The proposed answer only captures part of the solution (the x < -9/2 part is correct, but incomplete), while completely missing other parts of the solution.
