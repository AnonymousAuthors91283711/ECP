abbrev P2009AMCB_8_answer : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem P2009AMCB_8 (a b : ℝ) :
  ∃ (w : ℝ) (c : ℝ), 
    (2/3 * c + w = a) ∧ 
    (1/2 * c + w = b) ∧ 
    (c + w = P2009AMCB_8_answer a b) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
The equations suggest solving for c and w, then expressing their sum in terms of a and b, eliminating c and w. Solving the linear system yields c = 2(a-b), w = 3b - a, and their sum c + w = a + b, which is the pattern from enumeration.
