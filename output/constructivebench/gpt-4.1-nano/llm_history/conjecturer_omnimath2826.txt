abbrev omnimath2826_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2826 :
  2 * (2 : ℝ) ^ 2 + 3 * (2 : ℝ) ^ 2 = omnimath2826_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests summing coefficients times powers of 2.  
Calculating: 2 * 2^2 + 3 * 2^2 = 2*4 + 3*4 = 8 + 12 = 20.  
Final answer: <<<20>>>
