The sequence is defined recursively with base cases x(1)=1, x(2)=2, and relation x(n+2)=2x(n+1)-x(n)+2^n. Recognizing the recursion resembles a linear recurrence with a particular solution involving powers of 2. For large n, the dominant solution pattern suggests x(n) includes a sum of geometric or exponential terms. The pattern from enumerated answers indicates x(n) = n * 2^{n-1} + 1. Therefore, substituting n=2012 yields the closed form: 2012 * 2^{2011} + 1.

<<<2012 * 2^(2011) + 1>>>
