The problem seeks the minimal size \( n \) of a subset \( L \subseteq \text{Fin 512} \) such that for every increasing team sequence, there exist \( t \in L \) with specific properties relating to $ t_1, t_2 $ and the sequence. Since the sequence is strictly increasing, and the sets involve a chain of inequalities, the minimal \( n \) aligns with the classical Erdős–Szekeres theorem, which states the minimal size for monotonic subsequences.

In this case, the minimal size for such a subset \( L \) related to a sequence of length 512 is \( \lceil \log_2 512 \rceil + 1 \).

Given \( 512 = 2^9 \), the minimal \( n \) is \( 9 + 1 = 10 \).

Thus, the answer is \( 10 \).

<<<10>>>
