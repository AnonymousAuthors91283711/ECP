The pattern from enumeration suggests the coefficients depend on the powers of the polynomial factors related to i's parity. Given the polynomial's structure, the coefficient of X^2 is derived mainly from second-order interactions, which likely involve a combination of positive and negative contributions, simplifying to a predictable quadratic pattern.

The final answer consolidates these into the known coefficients, with sign alternation and symmetry, leading to:

<<<15 * 14 / 2>>>

which simplifies to 105.
