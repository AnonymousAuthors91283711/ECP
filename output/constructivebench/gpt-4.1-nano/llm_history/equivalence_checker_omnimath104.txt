Ground Truth Answer: {a | Odd a}
Proposed Answer: {a : ℕ | a % 2 = 1}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer {a : ℕ | a % 2 = 1} is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer {a | Odd a}, as both define the set of odd natural numbers. In Lean/Nat, a % 2 = 1 is the standard way to express that a number is odd. The two formulations are just different syntactic ways of expressing the same mathematical concept.
