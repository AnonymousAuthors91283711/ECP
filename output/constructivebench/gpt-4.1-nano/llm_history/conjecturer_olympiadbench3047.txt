The pattern suggests solving for logb 2 (sqrt x). Given logb (sqrt 2) x = 20, rewrite as logb (sqrt 2) x = 20. Using change of base, logb (sqrt 2) x = (log b x) / (log b sqrt 2). Since logb sqrt 2 = (1/2) logb 2, then logb 2 (sqrt x) = (1/2) logb 2 x. From the given, logb 2 x = 2 * 20 = 40. Therefore, logb 2 (sqrt x) = (1/2) * 40 = 20. So, the answer depends only on logb 2 x, which relates to logb (sqrt 2) x, giving the simple scaled relation.
