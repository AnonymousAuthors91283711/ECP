The pattern suggests the answer relates to the size of the matrix (n) and the effect of adding 1 to rows and columns.

Since we are considering the maximum N satisfying a property over matrices obtained via operations, and the enumerations suggest a function like n^2, adjusted for possible overlaps, a typical bound is quadratic in n.

Given the pattern and the enumeration hints, a natural closed-form is N = n^2.
