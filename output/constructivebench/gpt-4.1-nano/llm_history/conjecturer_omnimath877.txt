  (hX : X = (sSup {x : ℤ | |x * Z| ≤ 5})) :
  X = omnimath877_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℤ
Given Z = 2, we find X as the supremum of x where |x * 2| ≤ 5, i.e., |2x| ≤ 5, so |x| ≤ 5/2. The supremum of such x is 5/2. Hence, answer in ℤ is 2 (since the supremum in ℤ is the greatest integer ≤ 5/2, i.e., ⌊ 2.5 ⌋ = 2).  
Final answer: <<<2>>>
