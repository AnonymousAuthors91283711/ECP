Ground Truth Answer: 39
Proposed Answer: 37
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have four natural numbers a, b, c, d that sum to 120
2. Each subsequent number is 6 more than the previous: b = a + 6, c = b + 6, d = c + 6
3. We need to find the value of d

Let's solve it step by step:
- b = a + 6
- c = (a + 6) + 6 = a + 12
- d = (a + 12) + 6 = a + 18
- Sum: a + (a + 6) + (a + 12) + (a + 18) = 4a + 36 = 120
- 4a = 84 → a = 21
- Therefore d = 21 + 18 = 39

The ground truth answer is correct (39), while the proposed answer is 37, which is incorrect.
