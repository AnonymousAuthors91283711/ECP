Ground Truth Answer: 26
Proposed Answer: 3
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find integer solutions (x, y) to the system:
   - 2x² + 8y = 26
   - x - y = answer (where answer is what we're evaluating)

2. The ground truth answer is 26, meaning x - y = 26.

3. The proposed answer is 3, meaning x - y = 3.

Let's check if both can be valid solutions:

For the proposed answer (x - y = 3):
Let y = x - 3
Substitute into first equation:
2x² + 8(x - 3) = 26
2x² + 8x - 24 = 26
2x² + 8x - 50 = 0
x² + 4x - 25 = 0
Solutions: x = [-4 ± √(16 + 100)]/2 = [-4 ± √116]/2 = -2 ± √29
But √29 is irrational, so no integer solutions exist for x - y = 3.

For the ground truth answer (x - y = 26):
Let y = x - 26
Substitute into first equation:
2x² + 8(x - 26) = 26
2x² + 8x - 208 = 26
2x² + 8x - 234 = 0
x² + 4x - 117 = 0
Solutions: x = [-4 ± √(16 + 468)]/2 = [-4 ± √484]/2 = [-4 ± 22]/2
Thus x = 9 or x = -13
Integer solutions exist: (9, -17) and (-13, -39)

Conclusion: Only the ground truth answer (26) yields integer solutions, while the proposed answer (3) doesn't. They are not equivalent.
