The pattern suggests that the sum of the gcd of each number from 1 to 91 with 91 is proportional to 91's divisors; specifically, the sum relates to the sum over divisors of 91 multiplied by the divisor's count in the range. Since 91 = 7 * 13, summing gcds yields \( \sigma(91) = 1 + 7 + 13 + 91 = 112 \), considering the multiplicities.

<<<112>>>
