The supremum occurs at x approaching 1, where n can be arbitrarily large but finite for each x. As n approaches infinity, the sum converges to 1. The maximum L satisfying the sum for all x in [0, 1) is 1.

The main error is due to writing a natural language explanation directly as a Lean expression, which is invalid syntax. The goal is to produce a closed-form real number representing the supremum, which from the explanation appears equal to 1. This is consistent with the reasoning: as the parameter n increases for x close to 1, the sum approaches 1 from below, but never exceeds it, so the supremum of all such sums over [0, 1) is 1. 

My conjecture, based on the problem and explanation, is that the answer should be a constant real number, namely 1. To fix the Lean code, I will set `omnimath3207_answer` to 1 (the real number).

Because the answer is the supremum of sums that tend to 1, and the problem requests a closed-form expression, the simplest correct expression is just 1. We should write:

<<<1>>>

which is a valid noncomputable abbreviation in Lean of type ℝ.

It is the natural choice here because the sum can be made arbitrarily close to 1, but not larger. The analysis matches the enumerated reasoning and the description in the prompt.
