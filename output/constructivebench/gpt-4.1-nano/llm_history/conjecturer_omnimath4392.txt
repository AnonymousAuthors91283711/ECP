The system of equations suggests symmetric cyclic relations among x, y, z. The solutions involve roots of quadratic equations derived from symmetry, leading to solutions where x = y = z or their cyclic variants. Given the patterns, the finite set of solutions are known to satisfy (x, y, z) = (1, 1, 1), (-1, -1, -1), or roots leading to complex solutions, but for integer solutions, only (1, 1, 1) and (-1, -1, -1). Thus, the set is these solutions:

<<<{(1, 1, 1), (-1, -1, -1)}>>>
