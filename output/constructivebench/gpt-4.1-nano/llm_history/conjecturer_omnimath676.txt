    (P : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ → Prop)
    (hP : P = fun a b c => a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ c > 0 ∧

The pattern suggests the minimal sum \( a + b + c \) satisfying the conditions is achieved when \( a=1 \), \( b=1 \), \( c=1 \) doesn't work due to modular constraints; then check smallest positive integers fitting the last digits.  
Given \( a^b \equiv 4 \pmod{10} \Rightarrow a \equiv 2,8 \pmod{10} \), similarly for other powers, minimal sum arises at \( a=2, b=4, c=3 \).  
Addition yields \( 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 \).  
Thus, the least sum is 9.
