Ground Truth Answer: 12
Proposed Answer: 6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the number of natural numbers d that divide 20⁴ × 11ᵀ (where T=5) and are perfect cubes (d = m³ for some m).

2. First, factorize the number:
   20⁴ × 11⁵ = (2² × 5)⁴ × 11⁵ = 2⁸ × 5⁴ × 11⁵

3. For d to be a perfect cube divisor, its exponents in the prime factorization must all be multiples of 3:
   - For 2: possible exponents 0,3,6 (3 choices)
   - For 5: possible exponents 0,3 (2 choices)
   - For 11: possible exponents 0,3 (2 choices)

4. Total number of cube divisors: 3 × 2 × 2 = 12

The ground truth answer is 12, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 6, which is incorrect.
