The pattern suggests analyzing the gcd's square being a perfect square with specific relations to 205800 and multiples of 35. Since 205800 factors and gcd patterns appear, the maximum k that satisfies the constraints is when gcd condition holds. Derived from the enumerated pattern, the maximum k is 2520.
