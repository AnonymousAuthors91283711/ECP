Since d divides 900, d is a positive divisor of 900, and d is a perfect square, the answer is the number of perfect square divisors of 900. The divisors are squares of divisors of 30 (since 900 = 30^2 * 1), and there are four perfect square divisors: 1 (=1^2), 4 (=2^2), 9 (=3^2), 36 (=6^2), 100 (=10^2), 225 (=15^2), 900 (=30^2). So, total is 7.

The primary errors in your current answer stem from the use of natural language ("Since d divides 900...") within a Lean expression, which is syntactically invalid. Instead, the solution should be a proper Lean expression that computes the number of positive perfect square divisors of 900.

Given 900 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2, the divisors are generated by exponents (a, b, c) with 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 2 for each prime. For a divisor to be a perfect square, all exponents (a, b, c) must be even: 0 or 2, because only even exponents produce perfect squares.

Number of perfect square divisors = (number of choices for a) * (number of choices for b) * (number of choices for c) = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.

The divisors:
- 2^0 * 3^0 * 5^0 = 1
- 2^2 * 3^0 * 5^0 = 4
- 2^0 * 3^2 * 5^0 = 9
- 2^0 * 3^0 * 5^2 = 25
- 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^0 = 36
- 2^2 * 3^0 * 5^2 = 100
- 2^0 * 3^2 * 5^2 = 225
- 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 = 900

Thus, the total count is 8.

In Lean, this count is simply:
```lean
(2 : ℕ) * 2 * 2
```
because each prime contributes 2 options (exponent 0 or 2).
