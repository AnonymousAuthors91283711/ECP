The pattern suggests we're bounded by the maximum size of S that avoids certain pairwise equalities, likely related to the structure of Fin 2 → Fin 5. The key restriction limits how many elements can have matching coordinates without creating forbidden configurations. Given that a set with 6 elements can force such a pattern, the maximum size is probably 5.
