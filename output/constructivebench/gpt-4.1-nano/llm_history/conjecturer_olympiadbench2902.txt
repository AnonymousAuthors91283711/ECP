Considering the set definitions, the intersection contains rationals with denominator dividing both 4 and 6, i.e., multiples of 1/12. Since the count of values less than the Tth answer in the intersection matches T-1, the answer should be the Tth multiple of 1/12 starting from 0. 

Conjecture: the Tth element is (T-1)/12.
