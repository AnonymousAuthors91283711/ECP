theorem P2013AIMEI_1 :
  ∃ (swim_speed : ℝ), 0 < swim_speed ∧
  let run_speed := 5 * swim_speed
  let bike_speed := 2 * run_speed
  let swim_time := 0.5 / swim_speed
  let bike_time := 30 / bike_speed
  let run_time := 8 / run_speed
  swim_time + bike_time + run_time = 4.25 ∧
  bike_time * 60 = P2013AIMEI_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the answer involves the sum of times, but mainly, the bike_time multiplied by 60 gives the required answer. The total time equals 4.25 hours, and using bike_speed = 2 * 5 * swim_speed = 10 * swim_speed, heuristic shows bike_time = 30 / (2 * run_speed). Since run_speed = 5 * swim_speed, bike_time simplifies to a fixed numeric value scaled appropriately. The pattern indicates the answer is 120, corresponding to the bike_time in minutes.
