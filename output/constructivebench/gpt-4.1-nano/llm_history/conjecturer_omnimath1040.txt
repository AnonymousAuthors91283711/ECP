Based on the enumeration pattern, each problem has choices {0,1,7}, total sum varies, and maximum sum is 6*7=42 with sums starting at 0. The counts appear to follow a binary pattern corresponding to inclusion/exclusion. The total number of feasible sums is 43 (from 0 to 42). 

Final answer:
<<<42>>>
