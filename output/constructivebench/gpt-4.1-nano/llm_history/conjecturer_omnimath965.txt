noncomputable abbrev omnimath965_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath965 : 
  (∫ a in (0:ℝ)..1, ∫ b in (0:ℝ)..1, ∫ c in (0:ℝ)..1, min a (min b c)) = omnimath965_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The integrand min a (min b c) is symmetrical; the integral over the unit cube simplifies to three times the expected value conditioned on a, considering symmetry. The known result for the expectation of min of three independent uniform variables is \( \frac{1}{4} \). Therefore, the integral equals \( 3 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \).
