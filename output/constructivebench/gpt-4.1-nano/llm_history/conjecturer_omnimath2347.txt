abbrev omnimath2347_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath2347 :
  let Ω := Equiv.Perm (Fin 26)
  let p1 := (24 * 22! * (3!)) / (26!)
  let p2 := (23 * 23! * (2!)) / (26!)
  p1 / p2 = omnimath2347_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Based on the pattern, ratio, and factorial structure, the answer likely simplifies to a rational expression involving factorials. Simplifying the given ratios suggests the answer approaches 3/2. 

<<<(3 : ℚ) / 2>>>
