  (digits 10 29).sum = P2023AMCB_16_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The set contains all \( x \) not expressible as \( 6a + 10b + 15c \). The largest such \( x \) is 29; beyond 29, all are representable. The sum of digits of 29 base 10 is 2 + 9 = 11. So, the answer is 11.
