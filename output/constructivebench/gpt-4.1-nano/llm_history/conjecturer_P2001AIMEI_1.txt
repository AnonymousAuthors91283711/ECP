theorem P2001AIMEI_1 :
  ∑ k in (Finset.Icc 10 99).filter (fun k => ∀ d ∈ digits 10 k, d ≠ 0 ∧ k % d = 0), k = P2001AIMEI_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests that the answer is the sum of all numbers between 10 and 99 where each digit divides the number, with digits nonzero to avoid division by zero. Summing these special two-digit numbers, the total sum is 540.
