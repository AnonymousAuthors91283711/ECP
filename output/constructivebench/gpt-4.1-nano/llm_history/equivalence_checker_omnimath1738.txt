Ground Truth Answer: fun f => ∃ a b, ∀ x, (5 ∣ x → f x = a * x / 5) ∧ (¬5 ∣ x → f x = b * x)
Proposed Answer: fun f : ℤ → ℤ => ∃ c : ℤ, ∀ x : ℤ, f x = c * x
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer states that the function f has two different linear behaviors depending on whether x is divisible by 5 or not (with coefficients a/5 and b respectively). This allows for piecewise linear functions where the slope changes based on divisibility by 5.

The proposed answer claims that f is simply a linear function (f(x) = c*x) with a single coefficient c for all integers x. This is a much stronger condition that doesn't allow for the piecewise behavior described in the ground truth.

The proposed answer is a special case of the ground truth where a/5 = b (i.e., when the function is purely linear), but the ground truth allows for more general solutions where a/5 ≠ b.

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
