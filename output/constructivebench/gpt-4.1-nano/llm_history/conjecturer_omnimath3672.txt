The pattern in enumerations implies functions with symmetric forms, likely constants or linear forms, satisfying the functional equation. Specifically, functions that, when plugged into the equation, preserve symmetry, such as f(x) = 0 or f(x) = x. The constant zero function always satisfies such equations, and the identity function might also satisfy the symmetry. Considering the regularity and the pattern, the set should contain these two solutions:

The error stems from the improper use of syntax inside the set comprehension. In Lean, when defining a subset of functions with specific properties, we should use set notation with property predicates, but write the predicates properly. The expression `{f : ℝ → ℝ | f(x) = 0}` is not valid because `x` is unbound; instead, it should be `∀ x, f x = 0`. Moreover, to define the union of two sets of functions specified by properties, it's better to use the union of their predicate conditions.

Given the problem, the set of all functions satisfying the functional equation appears to be exactly those that are identically zero or the identity function. So, the answer set contains exactly those two constant/identity functions.

To fix the syntax and define this set properly, I'll write:

```lean
{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x, f x = 0} ∪ {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x, f x = x}
```

This specifies the set of all functions either constantly zero or equal to the identity. This is direct, clear, and in line with the enumerated answers.

Hence, the corrected answer is:

<<<{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x, f x = 0} ∪ {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x, f x = x}>>>
