Ground Truth Answer: 1225 / 16384
Proposed Answer: 35/256
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer (1225/16384) and the proposed answer (35/256):

1. First, note that 4^8 = 65536, not 16384 (which is 4^7). This appears to be an error in the ground truth answer's denominator.

2. The proposed answer 35/256 is indeed equal to 1225/16384 when simplified:
   - 1225 ÷ 35 = 35
   - 16384 ÷ 256 = 64
   - But 35 × 35 = 1225 and 256 × 64 = 16384, so the simplification is correct.

3. However, the original problem states total_outcomes = 4^8 = 65536, making the correct answer 1225/65536, which doesn't simplify to 35/256.

The proposed answer would be correct if the denominator were 4^7 (16384), but since the problem states 4^8, the ground truth answer is incorrect and the proposed answer doesn't match the problem's conditions.
