The problem involves finding the minimal n such that certain mappings from Fin n to Fin 17 satisfy inequalities involving 118 and 119, with positivity constraints. The pattern from enumerations suggests the critical point occurs at n just before the ratio exceeds the bound. The smallest such n satisfying the conditions is 17, since for n < 17 the range isn't sufficient, and at n=17 the inequality is tight.
