theorem omnimath1170 : 
  2 ^ ((1/6) * ((log 3 / log 2)^3 - (log 6 / log 2)^3 - (log 12 / log 2)^3 + (log 24 / log 2)^3)) = omnimath1170_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The expression involves powers of 2 and logs with base change formula. Noting the pattern, the logs simplify via change of base and groupings, leading to a rational exponent. The pattern suggests the entire exponential simplifies to a power of 2 with a fractional exponent. Based on this pattern and pattern matching, the final simplified answer is 1.
