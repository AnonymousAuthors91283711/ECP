theorem P2023AMCB_1 : 
  let total := 3 + (1/3)
  let target := total / 4
  let transfer := target - (1/3)
  P2023AMCB_1_answer = transfer / 3 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The total is \(3 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{10}{3}\). 
Dividing by 4 yields \(\frac{10}{3} \div 4 = \frac{10}{3} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{10}{12} = \frac{5}{6}\). 
Subtracting \(\frac{1}{3}\) from this gives \(\frac{5}{6} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{6} - \frac{2}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\). 
Finally, dividing by 3 yields \(\frac{1}{2} \div 3 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6}\).
