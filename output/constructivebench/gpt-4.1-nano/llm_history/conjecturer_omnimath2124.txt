The problem asks for the *cardinality* of the set of 8-digit numbers divisible by 9, with all digits distinct, and within the range [10,000,000; 99,999,999]. 

Number of 8-digit numbers with distinct digits: 9 × 9! (since first digit ≠ 0, then permutation of remaining 8 digits).  
Divisible by 9: sum of digits divisible by 9, the possible sums for distinct 8 digits are multiples of 9 from 45 to 72.  
Counting these arrangements leads to 8 such sums, with equal counts across all suitable digit sum combinations.

Final Answer (derived from total arrangements sum, considering divisibility constraints): 

<<<(8 * 7! * 2)>>>

or explicitly calculated:

<<<40320>>>
