Given the pattern and the logical structure, the minimal n satisfying the property seems to depend on p and q, with the solution involving the sum p + q plus an offset for the base case.

Considering the pattern in the enumeration, the answer is structured as p + q + 1.

<<<fun p q : ℕ => p + q + 1>>>
