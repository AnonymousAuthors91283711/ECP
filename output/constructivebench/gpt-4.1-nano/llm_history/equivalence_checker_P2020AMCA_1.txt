Ground Truth Answer: 1/5
Proposed Answer: (1 - 7/10) * (1 - 1/3)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem defines:
   - remainder = 1 - 7/10 = 3/10
   - maria_took = (1/3) * remainder = (1/3)*(3/10) = 1/10
   - The expression to evaluate is: 1 - 7/10 - maria_took = 3/10 - 1/10 = 2/10 = 1/5

2. The ground truth answer is indeed 1/5.

3. The proposed answer is: (1 - 7/10) * (1 - 1/3) = (3/10)*(2/3) = 6/30 = 1/5

Both answers simplify to 1/5, so they are equivalent.
