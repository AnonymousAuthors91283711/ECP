    (hP : ∀ a b, P a b ↔ a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ a ≠ b ∧ (if a < b then (a - 20) * (b + 23) = a * b else (b - 20) * (a + 23) = a * b)) :

Based on pattern recognition, the key condition relates a and b with the difference, involving factors of a−20 and b+23, and symmetry. The minimal sum s occurs when a and b are close to 20 and 23, satisfying the constraints. The minimal sum s is therefore 43, attained when a=20, b=23.
