theorem omnimath2765 (n : ℚ) : 
  1/(2 * n) + 1/(4 * n) = 3/12 ↔ n = omnimath2765_answer 3 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ → ℚ
Based on the pattern, the sum simplifies to 3/12 = 1/4, which can be expressed as a constant function when equated. The value of `n` that satisfies the relation, given the fractions, is 3. The function should return the specific `n` value that makes the equivalence true, thus the general form is a constant function tailored for `n = 3`.
