Based on the pattern of distinct fractions summing to 1, with each q = 1/(n+1), the sum of such four terms could be 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/12, summing to 1.

In terms of n, these fractions are 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/12, which correspond to n = 1, 2, 3, 11 respectively.

Expressed in Lean, this is:

<<<[1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/12]>>>
