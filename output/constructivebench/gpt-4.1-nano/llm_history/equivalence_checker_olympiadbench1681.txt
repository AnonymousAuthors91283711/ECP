theorem olympiadbench1681 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
    Surjective f ∧ (∀ m n p, Prime p → (p ∣ f (m + n) ↔ p ∣ f m + f n)) ↔ f = olympiadbench1681_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n * 2^(n - 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function f: ℕ → ℕ that satisfies two conditions:
   - f is surjective
   - For all m, n, p where p is prime: p divides f(m+n) iff p divides (f(m) + f(n))

2. Ground truth answer is the identity function f(n) = n
   - This is clearly surjective
   - For the second condition: p divides (m+n) iff p divides (m + n), which is trivially true

3. Proposed answer is f(n) = n * 2^(n-1)
   - This function is not surjective (e.g., 3 is not in its range)
   - For the second condition, take m=n=1, p=3:
     f(1+1) = f(2) = 2*2^1 = 4
     f(1)+f(1) = 1*2^0 + 1*2^0 = 2
     3 divides 4 is false, 3 divides 2 is false - this case works
     But take m=1, n=2, p=3:
     f(1+2) = f(3) = 3*2^2 = 12
     f(1)+f(2) = 1 + 4 = 5
     3 divides 12 is true, 3 divides 5 is false - fails the condition

The proposed answer fails both conditions of the theorem, while the ground truth answer satisfies them.
