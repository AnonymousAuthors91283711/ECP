The pattern suggests counting leap years correctly, with 97 leap years in a 100-year cycle, and considering 2012 as a leap year. The number of days includes leap year adjustments, and since the starting day is known, the answer is the smallest y > 2012 such that total days mod 7 = 0, which occurs next at y = 2016. 

<<<2016>>>
