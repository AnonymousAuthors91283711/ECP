Ground Truth Answer: (0, 1 / 2)
Proposed Answer: ( -2, Real.exp 2 + 1 / Real.exp 1 - 2 )
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a value 'a' that satisfies the symmetry condition ∀ x, f(x) = f(2a - x), and then evaluates f at a specific point.

2. For the symmetry condition, we need to find 'a' such that the function f(x) = exp(x+1) + exp(-x) - 2 is symmetric about x = a. This requires solving for when the derivative is zero (finding the minimum point), which occurs at x = -1/2. Therefore, a = -1/2 would be the correct symmetry point.

3. The ground truth answer (0, 1/2) doesn't match this symmetry condition (a should be -1/2, not 0), and the y-value 1/2 matches f(-1) = exp(0) + exp(1) - 2 ≈ 1 + 2.718 - 2 ≈ 1.718, not 0.5.

4. The proposed answer (-2, exp(2) + 1/exp(1) - 2) also doesn't satisfy the symmetry condition (a should be -1/2, not -2), and the y-value doesn't match the required condition.

Both answers are incorrect, but they're incorrect in different ways. The ground truth answer is closer to being correct for f(-1) but wrong about the symmetry point, while the proposed answer is wrong on both counts.
