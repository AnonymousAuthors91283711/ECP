Ground Truth Answer: -150
Proposed Answer: -481.5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have two equations:
   - (x - y)/(x + y) = 9
   - (x*y)/(x + y) = -60

2. The expression to evaluate is: (x + y) + (x - y) + x*y

3. Simplifying the expression:
   (x + y) + (x - y) + x*y = 2x + x*y

4. From the first equation: x - y = 9(x + y) ⇒ x = (10/8)y = (5/4)y

5. From the second equation: x*y = -60(x + y)

6. Substituting x = (5/4)y into the second equation gives y = -24, x = -30

7. Plugging these values into the expression: 2*(-30) + (-30)*(-24) = -60 + 720 = 660

Wait, this contradicts both answers. Let me re-examine:

The ground truth says -150, proposed says -481.5, but our calculation gives 660. 

This suggests neither answer matches our calculation. However, perhaps the expression was meant to be different. 

Looking back at the original expression: (x + y) + (x - y) + x*y
This clearly simplifies to 2x + x*y

With x = -30, y = -24:
2*(-30) + (-30)*(-24) = -60 + 720 = 660

Therefore, both given answers are incorrect.
