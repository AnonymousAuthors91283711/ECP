Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 4, 8), (3, 5, 15)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b, c) | ∃ n : ℕ, n > 1 ∧ a = n + 1 ∧ b = n^2 + 1 ∧ c = n^3 + 1}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all integer triples (a,b,c) where:
   - 1 < a < b < c
   - (a-1)(b-1)(c-1) divides (abc - 1)

2. Ground truth gives two specific solutions: (2,4,8) and (3,5,15)

3. Proposed answer suggests a parametric solution:
   a = n+1, b = n²+1, c = n³+1 for n > 1

Let's test the proposed solution:
- For n=2: (3,5,9) - but 9 doesn't match ground truth (which has 15 for n=2)
- For n=1: excluded by n>1
- For n=2: gives (3,5,9) but ground truth has (3,5,15)
- The proposed form doesn't yield (2,4,8) at all

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It doesn't include (2,4,8)
2. For n=2 it gives (3,5,9) instead of (3,5,15)
3. The parametric form doesn't match the ground truth solutions
