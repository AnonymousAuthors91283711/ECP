: {(p, q, r) : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ | p > 0 ∧ q > 0 ∧ r > 0 ∧ Nat.Prime p ∧ Nat.Prime q ∧ (r^2 - 5 * q^2) / (p^2 - 1) = 2} = omnimath3736_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)
The expression involves primes \(p, q\), and a relation on \(r\). Given the pattern, solutions likely include minimal primes and specific values of \(r\). Based on the formula, the minimal primes \(p=2, q=2\) satisfy the relation with \(r=3\) resulting in a valid integer. Thus, the set contains the triplet \((2, 2, 3)\). To generalize with no existential quantifier, fix \(p=2, q=2\), and derive \(r\) accordingly.  
Final answer: <<<{(2, 2, 3)}>>>
