The pattern suggests digits a,b,c,d are distinct with specific ranges, and the equation involves their combinations. Given the constraints, the most probable consistent solution for a is 1, and the pattern suggests b=0, c=2, d=8 based on small digit combinations fitting the linear constraints.

Thus, the closed form expression in Lean is:

<<<(100000 * 1 + 10000 * 0 + 1000 * 2 + 100 * 1 + 10 * 2 + 8)>>>

which simplifies to:

<<<102128>>>
