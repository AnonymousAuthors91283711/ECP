Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n^2 - n + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n * (n + 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal number k such that for any strictly monotonic station arrangement on n² stations, and two sets A and B of size k with certain ordering properties, there must exist a common path in both A and B.

2. The ground truth answer is n² - n + 1. For n=2: 4-2+1=3
For n=3: 9-3+1=7

3. The proposed answer is n*(n+1). For n=2: 2*3=6
For n=3: 3*4=12

The values don't match:
- For n=2: 3 ≠ 6
- For n=3: 7 ≠ 12

The proposed answer grows quadratically like the ground truth, but with different coefficients and constant terms. The answers are not equivalent.
