Ground Truth Answer: 10
Proposed Answer: 560
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number s that satisfies certain conditions about two arithmetic sequences a and b where:
   - The sequences never intersect (a_i ≠ b_j for any i,j)
   - a₂₀ + b₁₄ = 1000
   - b₂₀ + a₁₄ = s

2. The ground truth answer is 10, while the proposed answer is 560.

3. To verify, let's consider the general form:
   - aₙ = a₀ + n*da
   - bₙ = b₀ + n*db
   - From a₂₀ + b₁₄ = 1000, we get (a₀ + 20da) + (b₀ + 14db) = 1000
   - From b₂₀ + a₁₄ = s, we get (b₀ + 20db) + (a₀ + 14da) = s

4. The minimal s would occur when the sequences are as close as possible without intersecting. The difference between the two equations shows s = 1000 + 6(db - da).

5. The minimal positive difference would be when |db - da| is minimized (but not zero, since the sequences must never intersect). The smallest possible difference is 1, making s = 1000 ± 6. The smallest s would be 1000 - 6 = 994, but this contradicts the ground truth answer of 10.

6. There seems to be a misunderstanding in interpreting the problem or the ground truth answer. The proposed answer of 560 doesn't match any obvious minimal case, and the ground truth of 10 seems too small based on the equations.
