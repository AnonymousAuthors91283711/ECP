Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ A B : ℚ, ∀ x, f x = A * x + B}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ a b : ℚ, ∀ x : ℚ, f x = a * x + b}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer. The only difference is the choice of variable names (A,B vs a,b), which doesn't affect the mathematical meaning. Both answers describe the set of all affine (linear) functions from ℚ to ℚ, which is the correct solution to the functional equation given in the problem.
