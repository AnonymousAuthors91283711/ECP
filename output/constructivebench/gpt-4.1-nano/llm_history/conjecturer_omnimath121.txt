The functional equation resembles a Cauchy-type condition scaled by α, which suggests linear functions. Since f(k + m) = f(k) + f(m) under scaled bounds, the solutions are linear: f(k) = c * k. Differentiating confirms linearity, and the dependence on c is inherent. Thus, the entire set can be characterized by c in ℝ, leading to a closed-form solution.
