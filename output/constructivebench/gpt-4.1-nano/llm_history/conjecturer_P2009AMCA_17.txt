The given equations imply r₁ and r₂ satisfy a related quadratic. Recognizing or solving yields the sum as a constant function of a, which simplifies to a. Therefore, the sum r₁ + r₂ equals a.

The core of the problem is to find a closed-form expression for \( r_1 + r_2 \), given the relationships involving \( a, r_1, r_2 \), and the sums \( a / (1 - r_i) = r_i \).

From the given equations:
\[
a / (1 - r_i) = r_i \implies a = r_i (1 - r_i) \implies a = r_i - r_i^2
\]
which leads to:
\[
r_i^2 - r_i + a = 0
\]
for \( i = 1, 2 \). These are quadratic equations in \( r_i \) with the same coefficients, having roots that sum to:
\[
r_1 + r_2 = \text{sum of roots} = \frac{-b}{a} = 1
\]
since the quadratics take the form:
\[
r_i^2 - r_i + a = 0
\]
with the quadratic coefficients \( 1, -1, a \), roots sum to:
\[
r_1 + r_2 = \frac{1}{1} = 1
\]

The sum \( r_1 + r_2 \) is independent of \( a \). Importantly, the first quadratic's roots sum to 1; due to symmetry, the second quadratic with the same coefficients will have the roots summing to 1 again.

Therefore, the answer should be a constant, namely 1.

In your current code, the error arises because you attempted to define an answer involving `a` directly as `abbrev P2009AMCA_17_answer : ℝ := (a)`, which is invalid since `a` is a variable, not a constant. Instead, the closed-form answer is simply 1, a real number.

Final fixed answer:
<<<1>>>
