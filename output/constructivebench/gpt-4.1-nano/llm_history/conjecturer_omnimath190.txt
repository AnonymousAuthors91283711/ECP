Let's analyze the problem details for pattern recognition: the set A with a card of 11, sorted strictly increasing, covering all sums from 1 to 1500 via subsets, and the order embedding condition. The pattern indicates that the minimal 'a10' relates to the largest element in A, which must be at least 9, and the set's structure ensures all integers in the range are achievable sums. Based on enumeration and similarity to known minimal sum covers, the answer corresponds to the maximum element in A, which must be at least 11. The minimal such 'a10' respecting the constraints is 1023, matching the pattern of sums in binary representation. Thus, final answer:

<<<1023>>>
