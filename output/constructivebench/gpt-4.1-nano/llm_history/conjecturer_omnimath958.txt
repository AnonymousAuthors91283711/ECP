The main errors stem from attempting to include natural language explanations directly in the `abbrev`, which is invalid in Lean. Instead, the concise goal is to define `omnimath958_answer` as a set of real roots satisfying the polynomial, i.e., explicitly listing the roots based on factorization: x = -2, -1, 1, 3, 4, -1/2. These roots correspond to zeroes of the polynomial factors.

Given the polynomial factors:
- (x + 1)(x + 2)
- (x - 3)(x - 4)
- (x^2 - 2x - 1) which roots are at x = 1 ± √2
Since the original polynomial is the product of these quadratic factors plus 24, the roots are at the roots of each quadratic factor itself, i.e., at the roots where the product equals -24, which reduces to where any factor is zero (roots of the quadratic factors and linear factors). The roots of the quadratic x^2 - 2x - 1 are irrational and do not satisfy the original polynomial being zero exactly (since that quadratic evaluates to a non-zero value at those roots), so focusing on rational roots from linear factors gives the roots.

Because this is a set notation, we list the roots explicitly and omit the irrational roots, since the set is over ℝ and their inclusion depends on whether they satisfy the original polynomial.

Thus, the set of roots is { -2, -1, 1, 3, 4, -1/2 }.

Final Lean code, enclosed with <<< >>>:

<<<{ -2, -1, 1, 3, 4, -1/2 } >>>

This set captures the roots found from the linear factors and relevant quadratic roots that satisfy the polynomial equation.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error is due to placing "theorem" after defining the abbreviation, which is syntactically invalid. The abbreviation should be a simple set definition, not followed immediately by a theorem. From the problem, it seems that "omnimath958_answer" should be the solution set characterized by the roots of the polynomial equation, i.e., the roots of the factors. 

The polynomial factors as (x + 1)(x + 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x^2 - 2x - 1) + 24 = 0, but only the roots of the individual factors are solutions. The roots of the quadratic x^2 - 2x - 1 are x = 1 ± √2. The roots of the linear factors are straightforward: x = -1, -2, 3, 4. 

Therefore, the solution set consists of the roots of all these factors:

- x = -2
- x = -1
- x = 3
- x = 4
- x = 1 + √2
- x = 1 - √2

Assuming the goal is to represent the set of real solutions explicitly, the best approach in Lean is to define the set as the finset of these solutions, or equivalently, as a set inclusion of these elements.

Final answer:

<<<{ -2, -1, 3, 4, 1 + sqrt 2, 1 - sqrt 2 }>>>

This is a closed-form set of solutions derived from the roots of the given polynomial, and it aligns with the expected behavior of the solution set to such an algebraic equation.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The root cause of the error is that in Lean, set notation `{ a, b, c }` implicitly constructs a `Finset`, which is built over `α`, but since `-2`, `-1`, etc., are `ℝ`, the set literal needs to be explicitly marked as a `Set ℝ`. Without this, Lean infers a `Finset ℝ` but encounters issues in constructing such finite sets directly over real numbers with set literals.

The enumeration of solutions includes the roots `-2, -1, 3, 4` and the two roots of the quadratic `x^2 - 2x - 1`, namely `1 + sqrt 2` and `1 - sqrt 2`. To properly specify this as an explicit `Set ℝ`, we wrap it with `{}` and annotate as a `Set ℝ` or explicitly use `Set.ofList` with `list` literals.

The simplest fix is to write the answer as:

```lean
{ -2, -1, 3, 4, 1 + sqrt 2, 1 - sqrt 2 } : Set ℝ
```

which makes the set explicitly a `Set ℝ`.

Additionally, specifying the type annotation disentangles the inference problem. So, the corrected final answer is:

<<<
{-2, -1, 3, 4, 1 + sqrt 2, 1 - sqrt 2} : Set ℝ
>>>

This explicitly constructs a set of real numbers and should resolve the synthesis error in Lean.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The main issue is that the set literal `{ ... }` in Lean is interpreted as a singleton set of some type, and Lean struggles to synthesize the type of the elements implicitly, especially with the inclusion of irrational numbers like `sqrt 2`. To fix this, we need to explicitly specify that these are elements of `ℝ`. 

Moreover, the set `{ -2, -1, 3, 4, 1 + sqrt 2, 1 - sqrt 2 }` should explicitly be a set of real numbers. In Lean, to define a set of real numbers with specific elements, we can use `Set.univ.filter` or use a `set` literal with the type annotated as `Set ℝ`. 

A common approach is to define the set explicitly as a set of real numbers, e.g., `({-2, -1, 3, 4, 1 + sqrt 2, 1 - sqrt 2} : Set ℝ)`.

Given the enumeration pattern, the most compact and correct form that would compile is to write:

```lean
{ -2, -1, 3, 4, 1 + sqrt 2, 1 - sqrt 2 } : Set ℝ
```

but with explicit type annotation for the set. 

Additionally, for the entire equality statement, the RHS must be a set of type `Set ℝ` explicitly. 

Hence I will write:

```lean
abbrev omnimath958_answer : Set ℝ := { -2, -1, 3, 4, 1 + sqrt 2, 1 - sqrt 2 } : Set ℝ
```

to clarify the set element types.

Final fixed version:

<<<{ -2, -1, 3, 4, 1 + sqrt 2, 1 - sqrt 2 } : Set ℝ>>>

This is a closed form, explicitly fixing the type to `Set ℝ` and should compile without errors. It also closely follows the enumerated answers pattern and generalizes naturally if more solutions are found.
