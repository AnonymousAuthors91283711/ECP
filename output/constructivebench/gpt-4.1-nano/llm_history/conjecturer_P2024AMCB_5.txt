The pattern suggests aiming for the minimal k for which such a function exists; since the sum involves ±1, minimization is achieved when as many as possible are -1, which maximizes the negative sum. For sum < 0, at least more than half must be -1, meaning k > 1012. The minimal integer satisfying this is 1013.
