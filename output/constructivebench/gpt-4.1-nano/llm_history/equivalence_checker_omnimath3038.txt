abbrev omnimath3038_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3038 : 
  8 * omnimath3038_answer = 26 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 26 / 8
Proposed Answer: (13 : ℚ) / 4
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer (13/4) is equivalent to the ground truth answer (26/8) because when simplified, 26/8 reduces to 13/4. Both represent the same rational number. The problem asks for a value that when multiplied by 8 gives 26, and both answers satisfy this condition.
