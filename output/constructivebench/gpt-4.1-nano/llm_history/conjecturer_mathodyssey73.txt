The pattern suggests the roots are a set of distinct numbers with the form x_i in (0,1), and the polynomial factors as a product involving (X - C x_i) and (X - C 1). The polynomial's degree is 2022, and the roots involve n points x_i in range, with multiplicities summing to 2022. To maximize n, roots should be simple and tightly packed to get the largest n with such a pattern. The best partitioning suggests n = 2022, using roots at equally spaced points in (0,1).
