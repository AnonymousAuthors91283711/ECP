theorem P2025AIMEI_15 :
  let N := Fintype.card {t : Fin (3^6) × Fin (3^6) × Fin (3^6) // (t.1^3 + t.2.1^3 + t.2.2^3) % 3^7 = 0}
  N % 1000 = P2025AIMEI_15_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Since the count involves triplets with a modular sum condition, and the enumeration pattern suggests a symmetric counting of solutions, the total likely reduces to the cube of a base count considering symmetry and modular constraints. Based on the pattern, the answer might be a power of 3 scaled by relevant combinatorial factors. 

Thus, the answer, simplified, reflects the total count modulo 1000, corresponding to \(3^6\).
