The condition n > 0 and ∃ m : ℤ, m^2 = n^2 - 3000 implies n^2 - m^2 = 3000, i.e., (n - m)(n + m) = 3000. Since n > 0, (n - m) and (n + m) are positive divisors of 3000 with same parity, leading to sum = 2n and difference = 2m. The sum of all such positive odd factors pairs gives all possible n's. After factoring, the divisors of 3000 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75, 100, 120, 125, 150, 200, 250, 300, 375, 500, 600, 750, 1000, 1500, 3000. For each, the pair should satisfy x * y = 3000 with x, y positive, and x + y even (both odd or both even). The pairs with same parity are (1, 3000), (3, 1000), (5, 600), (15, 200), (25, 120), (75, 40). Sum of n's is sum over these pairs: n = (x + y)/2. So, final answer sums all n for pairs with x + y divisible by 2.

The main issues are that in your definition `abbrev`, you are trying to assign a logical statement or condition directly to a `ℕ` (natural number). The variable `omnimath720_answer` should be a concrete natural number, specifically the sum of the `n` values calculated from the divisor pairs that satisfy the parity conditions. 

Given the pairs `(1, 3000)`, `(3, 1000)`, `(5, 600)`, `(15, 200)`, `(25, 120)`, `(75, 40)`, only those with both numbers having the same parity (both odd or both even) will produce valid `n = (x + y) / 2`. 

- For `(1, 3000)`, sum = 3001 (odd), discard.
- For `(3, 1000)`, sum = 1003 (odd), discard.
- For `(5, 600)`, sum = 605 (odd), discard.
- For `(15, 200)`, sum = 215 (odd), discard.
- For `(25, 120)`, sum = 145 (odd), discard.
- For `(75, 40)`, sum = 115 (odd), discard.

In fact, only the pairs where `x + y` is even (both odd or both even) are valid, and the only such pairs are `(1, 3000)` and `(25, 120)`, since their sums are 3001 and 145, both odd, so no valid pairs. But from the divisors listed, actual same parity pairs are those with both even or both odd. 

Better approach: filter the pairs with both divisors either both odd or both even, then sum `(x + y) / 2`. 

Let's verify pairs with same parity:

- `(1, 3000)` — 1 (odd), 3000 (even) → different parity, discard.
- `(3, 1000)` — odd, even → discard.
- `(5, 600)` — odd, even → discard.
- `(15, 200)` — odd, even → discard.
- `(25, 120)` — odd, even → discard.
- `(75, 40)` — odd, even → discard.

No pairs with both odd or both even, except perhaps if you include pairs such as `(50, 60)` or similar.

Given that the divisor pairs' parity determines the validity, and considering the divisor list, the only pairs with the same parity are when both are even, like `(2, 1500)`, `(6, 500)`, `(10, 300)`, `(30, 100)`, `(40, 75)` — but note that 75 is odd, so discard.

Hence, the pairs that satisfy the parity condition (both even):

- `(2, 1500)`, `(6, 500)`, `(10, 300)`, `(30, 100)`.

Calculate their sum:

- `(2 + 1500) / 2 = 751`
- `(6 + 500) / 2 = 503`
- `(10 + 300) / 2 = 155`
- `(30 + 100) / 2 = 65`

The total sum is: 751 + 503 + 155 + 65 = 1474

Thus, the correct `omnimath720_answer` is 1474.

**Final Fix:**

- Replace `sorry` with the sum above.
- Define `omnimath720_answer` as `1474`.
- Make sure it is of type `ℕ` (natural number).

The given error indicates that placing `import Mathlib` inside the definition of `omnimath720_answer` is invalid syntax in Lean. Imports must be at the very top of the file, not within an expression or definition. Since you have already imported Mathlib at the beginning, I will focus solely on correcting the answer expression.

The sum is over positive integers `n`, where `n > 0`, and such that there exists an integer `m` with `m² = n² - 3000`. Equivalently, `n² - m² = 3000`, which factors as `(n - m)(n + m) = 3000`.

Given that, the classical way to compute the sum over such `n` is to factor 3000 into pairs `(a, b)` with `a = n - m`, `b = n + m`, and `a * b = 3000`, and then solve for `n` and `m`.

- We have:
  \[
  n = (a + b)/2, \quad m= (b - a)/2
  \]
- Both `a` and `b` must be odd or even to make `n` and `m` integers. Since `n` and `m` are integers, `(a + b)` and `(b - a)` must be even, meaning `(a, b)` must be both even or both odd.

- We only count positive `n`, so `a + b > 0`, and since `a, b` are factors of 3000, the positive divisors are relevant.

Based on the factorization of 3000 = 2^3 * 3 * 5^3, the divisors are numerous, but only pairs `(a, b)` with positive divisors leading to integer `n` and positive `n` are relevant.

From the pattern in enumerated answers, the total sum corresponds to the sum over these divisors.

The specific sum is then:

\[
\sum_{(a,b): a \cdot b = 3000, a \leq b, a, b \text{ same parity}} \text{ the positive } n = \frac{a + b}{2}
\]

Calculating the sum over all such pairs, the total sum is known or can be verified by pairing factors and summing.

In the context of the problem, the answer is 1474, which matches the sum of all such `n`.

Hence, the corrected formal answer:

<<<1474>>>

This is the concise closed-form answer expected by the theorem, representing the sum over all such `n`.
