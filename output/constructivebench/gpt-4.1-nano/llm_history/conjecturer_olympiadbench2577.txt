(hf : f 1 = 1 ∧ (∀ n : ℕ, n > 0 → Even n → f n = f (div2 n)) ∧ (∀ n : ℕ, n > 1 → Odd n → f n = f (n - 1) + 1))

Given the recurrence relations:
- \(f(1) = 1\),
- \(f(n) = f(n/2)\) if \(n\) is even, 
- \(f(n) = f(n-1) + 1\) if \(n\) is odd and \(n > 1\),
we deduce \(f(n)\) counts the number of times we subtract 1 from \(n\) until reaching 1, then dividing by 2 each time. For \(n=50\); binary form: \(110010\) has 3 ones, so \(f(50) = 4\). 

Final answer: <<<4>>>
