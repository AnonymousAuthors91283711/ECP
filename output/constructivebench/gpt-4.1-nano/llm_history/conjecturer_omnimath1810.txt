The pattern suggests pairs (x,y) satisfying symmetric quadratic and linear relations. Solving x^2 + y = 12 and y^2 + x = 12 simultaneously reveals solutions involving quadratic roots. The solutions are (x,y) = (2,8) and (-2,-8). 

Thus, the set is explicitly these points, written as singleton sets or discrete points.

The errors indicate that the abbreviation `omnimath1810_answer` is wrongly defined using a descriptive sentence rather than a proper set of points. The solution involves explicitly describing the set of solutions (x,y) satisfying the two equations. From the analysis, the solutions are finite, specifically the points (2,8) and (-2,-8). Therefore, the set should be explicitly defined as `{ (2,8), (-2,-8) }`.

To fix the errors, I will:

- Remove the descriptive explanation.
- Properly define `omnimath1810_answer` as a set containing those two known solutions.
- Enclose the points in a set constructor `{}`.
- Use the Lean syntax for sets of tuples.

Thus, the corrected definition will be:

<<<{ (2, 8), (-2, -8) }>>>

This provides a concise, exact set solution that matches the candidate solutions and passes syntax checks.

Explanations:
- Using `{}` correctly constructs a set of pairs.
- The points are explicitly the solutions derived from solving the simultaneous equations.
- Avoid descriptive sentences in the set definition; only specify concrete solutions.

This matches reasoning and the enumerated answers, and should compile cleanly in Lean.
