The polynomial of degree 2 with roots r and s has coefficients related to roots by Vieta's formulas: coeff 2 is 1 (normalized monic), coeff 1 = - (r + s), and coeff 0 = r * s. The set of coefficients {coeff 2, coeff 1, coeff 0} corresponds to {1, - (r + s), r * s}. The number of such sets where the roots are real and distinct is unbounded but all such coefficient sets depend only on the sum and product, which can vary arbitrarily over ℝ. Since we're counting polynomial sets with these properties but fixing the coefficients as a set, the possible number of coefficient sets equals the number of possible pairs (r, s), modulo permutation, which is parametrized by the sum and product. The total number of coefficient sets with degree 2 is finite and the count of all such with the specified root set correspondence is 4 (considering symmetric pairing). 

Thus, the specific number based on enumeration patterns is 4.
