The ratio involving sums of arithmetic sequences suggests a pattern of proportionality. The ratio of the sums involving 3i and 5i yields a constant ratio of 4/11, which points to a simplified ratio for sums involving 2i and 4i. By linearity and proportionality, the ratio for 2i to 4i should be 1/2, matching the pattern of the sums. Therefore, the answer is 1/2.

<<<1/2>>>
