The pattern suggests counting 4-element subsets with cyclic orderings and minimum difference constraints. Enumerations imply configurations are based on differences ≥ 4 between consecutive elements.

Thus, for the maximum difference (since elements are from 0 to 9), the minimal difference pattern cycles with segments of size 4, yielding total configurations related to 6.

Final answer: <<<6>>>
