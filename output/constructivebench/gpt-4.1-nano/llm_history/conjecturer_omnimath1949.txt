theorem omnimath1949 : 
  (∑ k in Finset.range 64, if k = 0 then 0 else k * ((choose 127 k) % 8)) = omnimath1949_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern in the enumerated answers and typical binomial coefficient properties modulo small powers, the sum simplifies based on the binomial coefficients' divisibility and symmetry.

Corrected, closed-form, and generalized answer:
