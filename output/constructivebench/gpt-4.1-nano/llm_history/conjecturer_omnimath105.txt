The problem involves minimalities related to matrices and their sum of boolean entries, with the set capturing minimal k' where any such matrix with sum k' permits a specific operation list. This reflects the combinatorial minimal boundary, which is always 1 for positive n and within the range 1 to 2n, considering the smallest such k' that preserves the property. Therefore, the closed form corresponds to the minimal sum achievable, which is 1 in this upper-bound case.
