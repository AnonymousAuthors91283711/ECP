theorem P2017AMCB_1 : 
  10 + 6 * P2017AMCB_1_answer = 2 * (30 + 2 * P2017AMCB_1_answer) ∧ 
  (∀ m < P2017AMCB_1_answer, 10 + 6 * m < 2 * (30 + 2 * m)) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The equation 10 + 6x = 2(30 + 2x) simplifies to 10 + 6x = 60 + 4x, so 2x = 50, thus x = 25. For all m < 25, 10 + 6m < 2(30 + 2m), confirming the minimality.

<<<25>>>
