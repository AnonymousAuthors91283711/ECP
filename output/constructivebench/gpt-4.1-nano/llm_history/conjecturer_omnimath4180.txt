theorem omnimath4180 (m : ℕ) (hm : 2 ≤ m) :
  (∀ n, m / 3 ≤ n → n ≤ m / 2 → (m - 2 * n) ∣ choose n (m - 2 * n)) ↔ m ∈ omnimath4180_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Based on the pattern and divisibility conditions, the answer set likely contains even integers with specific bounds involving powers of 2. The divisibility by (m - 2 n) and the bounds suggest m must be divisible by 4 and within certain size constraints related to powers of 2. The enumeration pattern indicates that for m ≥ 4, the answer set includes all even m of the form m = 4 + 4k with k ≥ 0, up to some maximum determined by dividing powers of 2.

Final expression:

<<<{m : ℕ | 4 ≤ m ∧ m % 4 = 0}>>>
