Ground Truth Answer: 151
Proposed Answer: 68
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves functions f and g that operate on digits of numbers in different bases (4 and 8).
2. We're looking for the smallest positive integer n where g(n) has at least one digit ≥10 when represented in base 16.
3. The ground truth answer is 151, which comes from a reliable competition source (AIME).
4. The proposed answer is 68.

To verify:
- For n=68:
  - f(68) = sum of digits of 68 in base 4 (1010) → 1+0+1+0 = 2
  - g(68) = sum of digits of 2 in base 8 → just 2
  - digits of 2 in base 16 → just 2 (no digit ≥10)
  
- For n=151:
  - f(151) = sum of digits in base 4 (2113) → 2+1+1+3 = 7
  - g(151) = sum of digits of 7 in base 8 → 7
  - digits of 7 in base 16 → 7 (still no digit ≥10)
  
Wait, actually neither 68 nor 151 seem to satisfy the condition. However, the ground truth answer is known to be correct from the competition, so the proposed answer 68 must be incorrect.
