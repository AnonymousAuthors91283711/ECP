Ground Truth Answer: 722
Proposed Answer: 969
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating the absolute difference between two sums (A and B) and comparing it to a given value.

2. The ground truth answer is 722, which comes from a known competition problem (2015 AIME I Problem 1).

3. The proposed answer is 969, which is significantly different from 722.

4. The calculations for A and B would indeed lead to a difference whose absolute value is 722, not 969.

5. The proposed answer appears to be incorrect as it doesn't match the known correct solution.

<<<False>>>
