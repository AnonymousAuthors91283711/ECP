Ground Truth Answer: 135432
Proposed Answer: 123345
Let's analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest number (IsLeast) that can be formed by permuting the digits [1,2,3,3,4,5] which is divisible by 264.

2. To be divisible by 264, a number must be divisible by 8, 3, and 11 (since 264 = 8×3×11).

3. The ground truth answer 135432:
   - Divisible by 8: Last 3 digits 432 ÷ 8 = 54 → valid
   - Divisible by 3: Sum of digits 1+3+5+4+3+2 = 18 → divisible by 3
   - Divisible by 11: (1+5+3)-(3+4+2) = 9-9 = 0 → divisible by 11

4. The proposed answer 123345:
   - Divisible by 8: Last 3 digits 345 ÷ 8 = 43.125 → not divisible
   - Doesn't even satisfy the first divisibility condition

The proposed answer fails the basic divisibility requirement, while the ground truth answer satisfies all conditions and is indeed the smallest such permutation.
