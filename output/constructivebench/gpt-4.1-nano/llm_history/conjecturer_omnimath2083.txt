The problem seeks the maximum value of k, where k = n - a satisfying conditions involving coprimality and uniqueness among integers less than or equal to n.

By examining the pattern, the key is when n and a differ such that for all m ≤ n, Coprime(n+a, m) implies m = 1, and for b < a, there are two distinct coprime pairs.

Considering the structure, the maximum occurs when n is just below 100 and a is as small as possible satisfying the property, which leads to n=99, a=1, thus k=98.

Final answer: <<<98>>>
