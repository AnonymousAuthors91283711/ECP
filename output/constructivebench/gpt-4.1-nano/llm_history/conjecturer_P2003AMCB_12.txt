  IsGreatest {d : ℕ | ∀ n : ℕ, 0 < n → Even n → d ∣ n} P2003AMCB_12_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given that P2003AMCB_12 is the greatest divisor of all even n > 0, it must be 2, since 2 divides all positive even integers, and any larger divisor would not divide all such n.
