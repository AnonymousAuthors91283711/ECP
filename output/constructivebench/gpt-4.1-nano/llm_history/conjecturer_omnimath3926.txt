The pattern suggests the iterated sum of digits squared applied many times, especially for large n; for n=0, the value is k, and each iteration computes the digit sum squared. Notably, repeated digit sum squared converges to a fixed point, and for large n, this fixed point is 1. Since 1991 is large (> 30), the result stabilizes at 1.
