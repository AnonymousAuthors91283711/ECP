Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n)! - 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 2007 * n - n * (n - 1) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a polynomial P of degree 2008 with:
   - Leading coefficient 1
   - Evaluates to 2007-i at x=i for i=0 to 2007
   - Asks for P(2008)

2. The ground truth answer is n! - 1, which would give 2008! - 1 for n=2008.

3. The proposed answer is a quadratic function: 2007n - n(n-1)/2.

Analysis:
- The proposed answer is clearly wrong because:
  a) It's quadratic while the ground truth is factorial
  b) For n=2008, it gives a much smaller number (about 2 million) vs the enormous 2008!
  c) The problem requires matching 2008+1 points, so the polynomial should be uniquely determined

The proposed answer might match the first few values (n=0,1,2), but fails completely for larger n.
