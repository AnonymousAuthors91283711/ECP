The key conditions are θ < π and the product involving cos(2^k * θ) either non-zero or satisfies a certain identity. 

Since the product of (1 + 1 / cos(2^k * θ)) equals 1, this implies each cos(2^k * θ) must be 1, because the terms are positive and equal 1 only when cos(2^k * θ) = 1. 

cos(2^k * θ) = 1 ⇔ 2^k * θ ∈ 2πℤ, and for all k in [0, 10], this reduces to θ ∈ 2πℤ, considering divisibility. Given θ < π, θ must be 0.

Thus, the greatest θ satisfying all conditions is 0.
