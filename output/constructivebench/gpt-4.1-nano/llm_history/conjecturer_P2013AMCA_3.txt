abbrev P2013AMCA_3_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2013AMCA_3 :
  let total := 100
  let pink := 6/10 * total
  let red := total - pink
  let pinkRoses := 1/3 * pink
  let pinkCarnations := pink - pinkRoses
  let redCarnations := 3/4 * red
  let totalCarnations := pinkCarnations + redCarnations
  totalCarnations = P2013AMCA_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Given the ratios and decompositions:
pink = (3/5) * 100 = 60,
pinkRoses = (1/3) * 60 = 20,
pinkCarnations = 60 - 20 = 40,
red = 40,
redCarnations = (3/4) * 40 = 30,
totalCarnations = 40 + 30 = 70.

Thus, answer = 70.

<<<70>>>
