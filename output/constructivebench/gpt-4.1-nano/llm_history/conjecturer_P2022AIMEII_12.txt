The pattern suggests the minimal sum occurs at the intersection of the constraints, with \( a \) and \( b \) minimized under the conditions. Given the linear relations, the minimal \( a + b \) is obtained at the minimum \( x^2 + y^2 \leq 1 \), with \( a = x + 4 y \), \( b = 5 x + y \). Combining inequalities, the minimal sum occurs when \( x^2 + y^2 =1 \). Substituting minimal \( x,y \) satisfying the constraints, the minimal \( a + b \) is achieved when \( x = 0 \), \( y = 1 \), yielding \( a = 4 \), \( b = 1 \), sum \( 5 \). Adding the bounds on \( a \) and \( b \), the minimum sum, considering inequalities, is \( 5 \).
