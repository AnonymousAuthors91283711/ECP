theorem P2013AMCB_4 (miles : ℕ) (gas_ray gas_tom : ℕ) 
  (h_ray : gas_ray = miles / 40) (h_tom : gas_tom = miles / 10) :
  2 * miles / (gas_ray + gas_tom) = P2013AMCB_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The values are proportional to miles, with gas_ray = miles / 40 and gas_tom = miles / 10, so sum is miles / 40 + miles / 10 = (1/40 + 1/10) * miles = (1/40 + 4/40) * miles = 5/40 * miles = 1/8 * miles. Therefore, 2 * miles / (gas_ray + gas_tom) = 2 * miles / (1/8 * miles) = 2 / (1/8) = 16. Corrected for the full form, the final answer is 16.

<<<16>>>
