The conditions suggest functions with specific scaling and idempotence properties involving \(a\). For solutions to satisfy \(f(ax) = a^2 f(x)\) and \(f(f(x)) = a f(x)\), the most natural candidates are proportional to \(x\) or constant functions, depending on \(a\). When \(a ≠ 1\), these lead to solutions where the set includes all scalar multiples of \(\frac{1}{1 - a}\), and for \(a = 1\), the set of all points where the function is constant or linear. Concluding, the set contains all \(a\) such that the specified form is consistent.

The main error in the proposed answer is the inclusion of an explanatory paragraph within the abbreviation definition, which is invalid in Lean syntax. To correct this, I will interpret the problem's conditions to identify the set of all \(a\) for which there exists such a function \(f\).

The conditions:
- \(f(ax) = a^2 f(x)\),
- \(f(f(x)) = a f(x)\),
- and \(f(x) \neq x\) for some \(x\).

Assuming the form of \(f\), the solutions involve considerations of whether \(a=1\), \(a=0\), or other values. For \(a \neq 1\), the function resembles a linear scaling, while for \(a=1\), the function might be constant or linear functions satisfying the idempotent condition.

Based on this, the set includes at least \(a=0\) (constant functions), \(a=1\) (identity or constant solutions), and potentially other \(a\) satisfying specific algebraic relationships.

Final answer: For a closed formal set in Lean that characterizes all \(a\) satisfying these functional conditions, a minimal and sensible concise description is:

<<<{a : ℝ | a = 0 ∨ a = 1}>>>
