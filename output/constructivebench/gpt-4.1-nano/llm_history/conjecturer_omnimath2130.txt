The enumeration suggests the answer relates to the maximum number of such polynomials, constrained by degree and coefficient bounds, spanning a finite set. Since the degrees are ≤7, and coefficients are in [-7,7], the total combinations are bounded by (15)^(degree+1), and considering the polynomial's structure, the count relates to 7. The maximum count, obtained combinatorially, is 8*7^8.
