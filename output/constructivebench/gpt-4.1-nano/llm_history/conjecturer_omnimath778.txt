The condition "∀ a b, a ∣ N → b ∣ N → a ≠ b → 3 ∣ (a - b)" implies all distinct divisors are congruent modulo 3. To maximize N * number of divisors, N should be a multiple of 3 with divisors differing by multiples of 3. 

The largest such N < 1000 is N = 396, whose divisors form consecutive classes mod 3. Divisors of 396 are uniform mod 3.

Answer:
<<<396 * (Nat.divisors 396).card>>>
