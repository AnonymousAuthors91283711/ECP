abbrev omnimath3425_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3425 : 
  (1 + 1/2) * (1 + 1/3) * (1 + 1/4) * (1 + 1/5) * (1 + 1/6) * (1 + 1/7) * (1 + 1/8) * (1 + 1/9) = omnimath3425_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The product simplifies as telescoping: (2/1)(3/2)(4/3)(5/4)(6/5)(7/6)(8/7)(9/8) = 9/1 = 9 So, the answer is 9.

<<<(9 : ℚ)>>>
