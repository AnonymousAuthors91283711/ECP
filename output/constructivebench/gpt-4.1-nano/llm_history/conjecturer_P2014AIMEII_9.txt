The problem involves counting 3-element consecutive sequences modulo 10, including the element \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\). The pattern suggests counting sequences with consecutive residues modulo 10, with the specific element \(x\) in \(s\). There are 10 choices for \(x\) (from 0 to 9). For each \(x\), the set \(s\) must contain \(x, x+1, x+2 \ ( \text{mod } 10)\), which are fixed. The remaining elements of \(s\) can be any subset of the other 7 elements (out of 10). So, for each fixed triplet, there are \(2^7\) choices. Multiplying: \(10 \times 2^7 = 1280\).

Answer:

<<<10 * 2^7>>>
