The relations suggest a symmetry involving sum and difference of inverse terms linked to quadratic expressions and their difference. The pattern indicates the solutions are points where y and x satisfy certain symmetric polynomial relationships, likely leading to y = ± x as key solutions. Since these satisfy the equations under specific conditions, the answer set should include points on these symmetric lines.

The current answer is a natural candidate for the solution set based on symmetry considerations. To fix the Lean code and produce a valid explicit description, I will translate the pattern "points where y = x or y = -x" into a set notation compatible with Lean's syntax. Specifically, the set of all pairs (x, y) where y equals x or y equals -x. This can be expressed as the union of two sets: {(x, y) | y = x} and {(x, y) | y = -x}. In Lean, this can be written as the union of two set comprehensions: 

{ (x, y) | y = x } ∪ { (x, y) | y = -x } 

Since the original answer is just a set of pairs with real entries, the fixed answer should be an explicit set description, closed-form, and match the pattern suggested by the derivations.

The errors in the current proposed answer stem from trying to include a long explanatory comment directly inside an `abbrev` definition, which causes syntax errors in Lean. To fix this, the answer should be a clean, closed-form set description that is syntactically valid in Lean.

Analysis suggests that the solution set corresponds to the points where y = x or y = -x, based on symmetry and the structure of the equations. Therefore, a natural explicit solution is the union of the two lines y = x and y = -x.

A correct Lean expression for this set is: 
- The union of two set constructions:
  - { (x, y) | y = x } which is `{ p : ℝ × ℝ | p.2 = p.1 }`
  - { (x, y) | y = -x } which is `{
    p : ℝ × ℝ | p.2 = -p.1 }`

Thus, the fixed answer is the union of these two definitional sets.

<<<
{ p : ℝ × ℝ | p.2 = p.1 } ∪ { p : ℝ × ℝ | p.2 = -p.1 }
>>>

This form avoids syntax errors, makes the set definition explicit and unified, and matches the symmetry pattern indicated in the initial analysis.
