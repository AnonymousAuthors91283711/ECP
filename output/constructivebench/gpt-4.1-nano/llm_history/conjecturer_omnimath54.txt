The pattern suggests the minimal m depends on the largest possible sum of coefficients x + y (bounded by m), for which an expression divisible by 2n can be formed for any two distinct intervals a, b. Since x + y ≤ m must accommodate the worst-case scenario, the minimal such m that works for all is roughly proportional to 2n - 1, considering the structure of a and b within the interval.
