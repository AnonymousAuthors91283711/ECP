Ground Truth Answer: 499500
Proposed Answer: (1000000 - 999) / 2 + 999
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting numbers between 1 and 1,000,000 where n mod 1000 > n mod 1001.

2. The ground truth answer is 499,500.

3. The proposed answer is (1000000 - 999)/2 + 999.

Let's compute the proposed answer:
(1000000 - 999)/2 + 999 = (999001)/2 + 999 = 499500.5 + 999 = 500499.5

This doesn't match the ground truth answer of 499,500. The proposed answer seems incorrect in its calculation and approach.

The correct approach would involve recognizing that the condition n mod 1000 > n mod 1001 holds exactly when n is not divisible by 1001, and in these cases, the condition holds for exactly half the numbers (due to symmetry). The exact count should be 499,500.
