Ground Truth Answer: 7
Proposed Answer: 2025 / 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence `a` with:
   - Base cases: a(0)=0, a(1)=1
   - Recursion: 
     - a(2n) = a(n)
     - a(2n+1) = a(n)+1

2. This is the binary weight function (number of 1's in binary representation)

3. Calculating a(2024):
   - 2024 in binary is 11111100000 (seven 1's)
   - Therefore a(2024) = 7

4. The proposed answer is 2025/2 = 1012.5, which:
   - Isn't an integer (while the answer must be)
   - Doesn't match the correct value of 7
   - Doesn't follow from the given recurrence relations

The ground truth answer (7) is correct, while the proposed answer is completely wrong.
