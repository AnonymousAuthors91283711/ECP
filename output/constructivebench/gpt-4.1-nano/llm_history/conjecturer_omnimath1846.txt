Given the problem involves monotone functions from (Fin 3 → Fin 2) to Fin 2, the answer likely pertains to counting order-preserving functions. The pattern suggests exponential growth based on the minimal number of choices for such functions, specifically the number of antichains or monotone maps between finite posets. Since enumeration shows the pattern of solutions, the closed form heavily relies on combinatorics of order-preserving maps. The answer is: the number of monotone maps from a 3-element chain to a 2-element chain, which is well known as the 4th Fibonacci number. 

The 4th Fibonacci number is 3, since: 1, 1, 2, 3,...

Therefore, the count is 8, as the number of order-preserving functions corresponds to 2^(n-1) for total chains.

Final answer: <<<2 ^ (3 * 1)>>>
