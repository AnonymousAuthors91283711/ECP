theorem omnimath754 : tilingCount 10 = omnimath754_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern of the recurrence `tilingCount` matches Fibonacci sequence shifted by two indices; specifically, `tilingCount n = Fib (n + 1)`. Since `tilingCount 10 = Fib 11`, the answer is `89`. 

<<<89>>>
