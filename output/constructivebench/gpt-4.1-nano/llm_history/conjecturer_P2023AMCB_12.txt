theorem P2023AMCB_12 (z : ℂ) :
    custom_op z z = z ^ 2 + 40 ↔ Complex.abs z = P2023AMCB_12_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the pattern that `custom_op z z` simplifies to `re z^2 + (im z)^2`, which equals `|z|^2`, and equating to `z^2 + 40`, the real part yields `re z^2 + (im z)^2 = |z|^2`. Since the property equates to `|z| = constant`, and the pattern suggests the answer relates to the square root of the constant sum, the explicit value should be √40.

<<<(real.sqrt 40)>>>
