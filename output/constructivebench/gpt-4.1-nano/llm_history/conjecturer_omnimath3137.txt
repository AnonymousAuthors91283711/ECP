  (5 * (5 - 1)) + (4 * (4 - 1)) = omnimath3137_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests summing products of consecutive integers: 5 * 4 and 4 * 3. Using the pattern, the overall sum appears to be the sum of n*(n-1) for n=4,5 (or similar). Generalized, the total is 2 * 5 * 4 which resembles n*(n-1) summed for n=4,5.

Answer: <<<5 * (5 - 1) + 4 * (4 - 1)>>>
