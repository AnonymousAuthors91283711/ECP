The problem counts integers \(a\) between 1 and 200 for which \(a^a\) is a perfect square \(k^2\). Since \(a\) must make \(a^a\) a perfect square, analyzing the prime factorization suggests that \(a\) must be a perfect square itself (to keep exponents integral when dividing by 2). The perfect squares \(a = m^2\) satisfy \(a^a = (m^2)^{m^2} = m^{2m^2}\), which is a perfect square for any \(m\).

Numbers \(a \leq 200\) that are perfect squares are \(1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196\).

Therefore, the count is 14.

<<<14>>>
