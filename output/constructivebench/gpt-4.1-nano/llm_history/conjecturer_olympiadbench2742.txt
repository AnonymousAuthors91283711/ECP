The defining condition relates to the expression \( \frac{1}{A(x)} + \frac{1}{B(x)} + \frac{1}{x+10} = \frac{1}{x} \). Recognizing the symmetry and the constraints, the solution suggests \(A(x) = x + a\) and \(B(x) = x + b\), with specific \(a, b\). The minimal polynomial satisfying the relations at \(x=10\) simplifies, and substitution leads to \(A(10) = 10 + 10 = 20\). The sum over all such \(A\) with leading coefficient 1 and the conditions reduces to a sum of all possible shifts, which evaluates as \(20\).
