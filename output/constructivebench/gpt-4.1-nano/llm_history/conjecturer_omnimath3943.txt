The set T consists of 100-digit numbers with digits only from 0 to 7, and the number must be divisible by 2^100. Since the last digit (least significant) must be even, the last digit is in {0,2,4,6}, and the first 99 digits can be any from 0 to 7.  
Number of choices: 8^99 for the first 99 digits, multiplied by 4 choices for the last digit.  
Answer: <<<4 * (8 ^ 99)>>>
