To find the sum of candidates where \(a^6 \nmid 6^a\), focus on divisibility condition \(a^6 \nmid 6^a\). Since \(6^a=2^a \cdot 3^a\), divisibility by \(a^6\) depends on the prime factorization of \(a\). For primes \(p\), \(a^6 \mid 6^a\) implies \(a\) divides \(6\), i.e., \(a\)'s prime structure is compatible. The candidates where divisibility fails are those with prime factors beyond 2 or 3, or with exponents surpassing those in \(6^a\). Summing these candidates yields the answer:
