The conditions specify that each a(i) are distinct, positive integers ≤5, with no three terms forming an arithmetic progression. The only 5-element subset of {1,2,3,4,5} with no 3-term APs is the entire set {1,2,3,4,5}. Thus, answer is 1, as only one such set exists.

<<<1>>>

This answer matches the logical conclusion that the set {1,2,3,4,5} is the unique one meeting all constraints.
