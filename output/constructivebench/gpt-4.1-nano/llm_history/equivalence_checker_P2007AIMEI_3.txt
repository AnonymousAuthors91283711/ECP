Ground Truth Answer: 15
Proposed Answer: 18
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves finding a real number b > 0 such that for z = 9 + b*i, the imaginary parts of z² and z³ are equal.

2. Calculating:
   - z² = (9 + b*i)² = (81 - b²) + 18b*i
   - z³ = (9 + b*i)³ = (729 - 27b²) + (243b - b³)*i

3. Setting imaginary parts equal:
   Im(z²) = 18b
   Im(z³) = 243b - b³
   So: 18b = 243b - b³ → b³ - 225b = 0 → b(b² - 225) = 0

4. Solutions: b = 0 or b = ±15
   But hb : 0 < b, so only b = 15 is valid.

The ground truth answer is 15, while the proposed answer is 18. These are clearly different numerical values, and the correct solution is 15.
