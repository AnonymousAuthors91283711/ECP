Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1), (3, 3)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1)}
Let's analyze this problem carefully:

1. The problem asks for pairs (m, n) where m, n > 0 and m² equals the sum of factorials from 1! to n!.

2. For n=1:
   - Sum = 1! = 1
   - m² = 1 ⇒ m=1
   - (1,1) is valid

3. For n=2:
   - Sum = 1! + 2! = 1 + 2 = 3
   - m² = 3 ⇒ m=√3 which is not natural
   - No solution

4. For n=3:
   - Sum = 1! + 2! + 3! = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9
   - m² = 9 ⇒ m=3
   - (3,3) is valid

5. For n=4:
   - Sum = 1! + 2! + 3! + 4! = 9 + 24 = 33
   - m² = 33 ⇒ m=√33 which is not natural
   - No solution

6. For n≥4:
   - The sum grows rapidly and it's unlikely to be a perfect square (this can be verified computationally)

The ground truth answer {(1,1), (3,3)} correctly includes both valid pairs, while the proposed answer {(1,1)} misses (3,3).
