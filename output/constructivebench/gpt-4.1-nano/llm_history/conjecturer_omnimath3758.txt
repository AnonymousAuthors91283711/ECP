The conditions imply that for all x, f(x+1) = f(x)+1 and f(x^2) = (f x)^2. The first indicates linearity by f(x + n) = f(x)+n, and the second suggests f preserves squares, hinting that f is of the form f(x) = x. Therefore, the only function satisfying both is f(x) = x.

The error in your proposed answer "{λ x : ℝ, x}" arises because in Lean, for lambda functions, the syntax should be 'fun x : ℝ => x' rather than '{λ x : ℝ, x}', which is invalid syntax. Moreover, the question asks for a set of functions satisfying the conditions: \(f(x+1) = f(x) + 1\) and \(f(x^2) = (f(x))^2\). 

The given conditions strongly suggest that \(f\) must behave like a linear function on certain domains, because:
- \(f(x+1) = f(x) + 1\) implies a translation property, hinting \(f\) could be of the form \(f(x) = x + c\) for some constant \(c\).
- \(f(x^2) = (f(x))^2\) indicates that \(f\) preserves squares in a certain manner; this is exactly satisfied by the identity function \(f(x)=x\).

Testing the identity function \(f(x) = x\):
- \(f(x+1) = x+1 = f(x)+1\), holds.
- \(f(x^2) = x^2 = (f(x))^2\), holds.
- \(f\) as the identity function clearly satisfies both conditions.

Check if other functions might also satisfy these:
- Any affine \(f(x) = x + c\) with constant \(c\):  
  \(f(x+1) = x + 1 + c\), and \(f(x)+1 = x + c +1\); matches.  
  \(f(x^2) = x^2 + c\), and \((f(x))^2 = (x + c)^2 = x^2 + 2cx + c^2\). To satisfy \(f(x^2) = (f(x))^2\), we'd need \(x^2 + c = x^2 + 2cx + c^2\), which only holds for all \(x\) if \(2c=0\) and \(c^2 = c\).  
  - \(2c=0 \implies c=0\),  
  - \(c^2=c\) with \(c=0\) or \(1\).  
  - Plug in \(c=0\): satisfies both conditions, giving the identity \(f(x)=x\).  
  - \(c=1\): check \(f(x+1)=x+1+1\neq f(x)+1=x+1\) unless \(x+2 = x+1 + 1\), which holds; and \(f(x^2)=x^2+1\), while \((f(x))^2 = (x+1)^2=x^2+2x+1\), not equal unless \(x=0\) only, so global equality fails.  
  Therefore, only \(c=0\) works, only the identity function remains.

For the square preserving function, besides identity, consider the constant zero function \(f(x)=0\):
- \(f(x+1)=0\) and \(f(x)+1=0+1=1\), so not equal − fails.
- The constant function \(f(x)=k\) !=identity unless \(k=x\).

Hence, the only function satisfying both conditions globally and for all \(x\) is the identity \(f(x)=x\).

Therefore, the set of all such functions is the singleton \(\{\lambda x, x\}\).

The corrected lean code should be:
```lean
{ fun x => x }
```
