Ground Truth Answer: 52
Proposed Answer: 78
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find the last two digits (mod 100) of the expression 4^127 + 5^129 + 7^131.

2. Ground truth answer is 52, while proposed answer is 78.

To verify, let's compute each term modulo 100:

- For 4^127: The powers of 4 cycle every 10 exponents mod 100 (4, 16, 64, 56, 24, 96, 84, 36, 44, 76, then repeats). 127 mod 10 = 7, so 4^127 ≡ 36 mod 100.

- For 5^129: Any power of 5 ≥ 2 ends with 25, so 5^129 ≡ 25 mod 100.

- For 7^131: The powers of 7 cycle every 4 exponents mod 100 (7, 49, 43, 1, then repeats). 131 mod 4 = 3, so 7^131 ≡ 43 mod 100.

Adding them: 36 + 25 + 43 = 104 ≡ 4 mod 100. Wait, this contradicts both answers.

However, my initial calculation for 4^127 seems incorrect. The correct cycle for powers of 4 mod 100 is more complex. The correct computation should be:

4^127 = (4^10)^12 * 4^7 ≡ 76^12 * 36 ≡ (76^2)^6 * 36 ≡ 76^6 * 36 ≡ 76^3 * 36 ≡ 76 * 36 ≡ 36 mod 100.

Similarly, 5^129 ≡ 25 mod 100 is correct, and 7^131 ≡ 43 mod 100 is correct.

Thus, 36 + 25 + 43 = 104 ≡ 4 mod 100, which matches neither answer. Therefore, both answers are incorrect.
