The conditions imply that ⌊20 - a⌋ = ⌊19 - b⌋ = k and ⌊a * b⌋ = k. Since 0 < a, 0 < b, and their floors are equal, approximate ranges of a, b are around integers close to 20 - k and corresponding ranges for a*b. The sum a + b varies continuously with these constraints, achieving maximum (LUB) at the boundary where the floors switch. Based on patterns, the supremum is at a + b close to 39. 

Final answer: <<<40>>>
