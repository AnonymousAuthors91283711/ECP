theorem omnimath3387 :
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | n > 0 ∧ 
    ∃ (v : ℕ), v > 0 ∧ 
      (∑ k in Finset.range n, (v - k) * (1/60)) = 2/3 ∧ 
      v - (n - 1) > 0 ∧ 
      v - (n - 1) < v} 
  omnimath3387_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern and the conditions, the minimal n is 2, with v = 1. The sum simplifies, and v conditions indicate the smallest value satisfying the inequalities is 1.
