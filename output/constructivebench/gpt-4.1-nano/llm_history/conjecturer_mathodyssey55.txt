Given f(x) and g(x) are quadratic with unknown coefficients, and specific ratios at x = -1, 1, and a value at x=6, the pattern suggests the coefficients are such that f(x) = x^2 + 18x + 99 and g(x) = x^2 + 3x + 6 to satisfy the ratio conditions and g(6) = 35. Therefore, f(6) = 6^2 + 18*6 + 99 = 36 + 108 + 99 = 243.
