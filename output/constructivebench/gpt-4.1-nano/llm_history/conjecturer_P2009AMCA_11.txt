The sequence defined by the recurrence relation resembles a shifted version of a quadratic polynomial, with initial conditions suggesting a quadratic pattern. Given the recursion and initial values, an explicit formula can be deduced as a quadratic in n.

The pattern in enumerated answers indicates polynomial growth, and solving the recurrence suggests a closed form like F(n) = 2n^2 + 3n + 1.

Answer in Lean:

<<<fun n => 2 * n * n + 3 * n + 1>>>
