<<<29>>>

**Explanation:**  
Given primes \( 2, 3, 5, 7 \), the problem states some divisibility constraints involving powers of 2 and 3, and primes dividing these expressions. Recognizing patterns analogous to Mersenne and Fermat primes, the smallest prime that could divide these expressions and meet the conditions is 29, which is known to be involved in related divisibility patterns of such exponentials.  
Thus, the smallest such number matching all conditions is 29.
