Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => (a + b) / Nat.gcd a b
Proposed Answer: fun a b => 2 * (b - a + 1) / 2 + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the least positive integer k such that the k-th iterate of a certain function f returns to 0.

2. The ground truth answer is (a + b)/gcd(a, b), which makes sense because:
   - The function alternates between adding a and subtracting b
   - The period would be related to when these operations balance out
   - This matches known results about such periodic systems

3. The proposed answer is 2*(b - a + 1)/2 + 1, which simplifies to (b - a + 1) + 1 = b - a + 2

4. Comparing these:
   - The proposed answer depends only on the difference b-a
   - The ground truth depends on both a and b through their sum and gcd
   - They give different results for most inputs (e.g., try a=2, b=4)
   - The proposed answer doesn't account for the gcd relationship
