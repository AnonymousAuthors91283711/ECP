Ground Truth Answer: fun _ => 1
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℚ => x
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is about finding all functions f: ℚ → ℚ that satisfy the given functional equation for positive rationals.

2. The ground truth answer suggests the constant function f(x) = 1 for all x ∈ ℚ.

3. The proposed answer suggests the identity function f(x) = x.

Let's test the proposed answer:
- For f(x) = x, the left side becomes x²y²
- The right side becomes x²y
- These are not equal (x²y² ≠ x²y in general for positive x,y)
- Therefore f(x) = x doesn't satisfy the equation

The ground truth answer f(x) = 1 works:
- Left side: f(x²*(f y)²) = f(x²*1²) = f(x²) = 1
- Right side: (f x)² * f y = 1² * 1 = 1
- Both sides equal 1, so it satisfies the equation

The answers are not equivalent.
