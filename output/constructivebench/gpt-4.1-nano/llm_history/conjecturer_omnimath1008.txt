The sum involves roots of unity and symmetry in cosine functions. Recognizing the pattern for such sums, the sum evaluates to zero due to evenly spaced roots around the unit circle, except possibly at certain indices. The pattern suggests the sum is 0, as these cosine terms symmetrically cancel out over the range.
