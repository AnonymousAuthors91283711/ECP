  IsLeast {hk : ℝ | ∃ x y h k : ℝ, 
    x^2 + y^2 = 1 ∧
    (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = 4 ∧
    h + k = hk}

The problem seeks the minimal value of hk under the specified geometric constraints. Recognizing the symmetry and the geometric interpretations, the minimal hk occurs when the circle centers and parameters are aligned in a way that minimizes hk, which suggests the point on the circle with minimal sum of h and k values, respecting the constraints. The minimal value for hk, given the constraints, should be 0, as the configuration minimizes the product by positioning h or k to be zero without violating the conditions.

Therefore, the closed-form answer is:

<<<0>>>
