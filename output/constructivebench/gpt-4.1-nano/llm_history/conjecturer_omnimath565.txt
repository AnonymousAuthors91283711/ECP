The pattern indicates that integers with an odd number of effective flips are those divisible by a perfect square greater than 1, similar to divisor counting parity. The only such divisors within 1 to 100 are perfect squares: 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100. Counting numbers divisible by each, inclusion-exclusion reveals total count as 34, covering all with odd toggles.
