theorem P2015AMCA_3 : 
  let students := 15
  let initial_avg := 80
  let final_avg := 81
  initial_avg * (students - 1) + P2015AMCA_3_answer = final_avg * students := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The total increase needed is 1 point on average for 15 students, so total points to add is 15. The previous total is 80 * 15 = 1200; thus, the additional points equal 15.

<<<15>>>
