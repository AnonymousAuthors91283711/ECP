abbrev omnimath3395_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3395 (k : ℝ) :
    let p1 := (3, 2*k + 1)
    let p2 := (8, 4*k - 5)
    (Prod.snd p2 - Prod.snd p1) / (Prod.fst p2 - Prod.fst p1) = 0 ↔ k = omnimath3395_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The expression represents the slope between points p1 and p2, which simplifies to (4*k - 5 - (2*k + 1)) / (8 - 3) = (2*k - 6) / 5. Equating to zero yields 2*k - 6 = 0 ⇒ k = 3. Thus, the answer is 3.
