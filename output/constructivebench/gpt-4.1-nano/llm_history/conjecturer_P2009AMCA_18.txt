The pattern suggests the answer involves the maximum valuation n where n equals the 2-adic valuation of (10^{k+2} + 64). Because 10^{k+2} + 64 factors as 2^{k+2} * 5^{k+2} + 64, the 2-adic valuation mainly depends on the power of 2 dividing this sum. Empirically, for k≥1, the valuation stabilizes at 3 as larger k introduces no higher powers of 2 dividing the sum. Therefore, the maximum value is 3.
