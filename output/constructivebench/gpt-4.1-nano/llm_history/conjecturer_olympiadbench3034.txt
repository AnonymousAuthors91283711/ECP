The set S characterizes N with exactly one more digit in 10-base, so N must be between 10^k and 10^{k+1}-1, and 2N should fall into [10^k, 10^{k+1}-1]. To have digit length increase only when moving from N to 2N, N should be within [5×10^{k-1}, 10^k). The count of such Ns per digit length is 5×10^{k-1}. The sum over all valid k (from 1 to 10) gives total N, with 11 digit cases, where the total count is sum_{k=1}^{10} 5×10^{k-1} = 5 × (10^{10}-1)/9. The answer should be the largest N = 10^{10}-1.
