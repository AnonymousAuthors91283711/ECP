<<<(13, 20)>>>

The total work after first interval is 1/3, so remaining work is 2/3. 
Work rate = (1/3) / (170 min) = 1/510 per minute.
Remaining time = (2/3) / (1/510) = (2/3) * 510 = 340 minutes ≡ 5 hours 40 minutes.
Starting from 11:10, adding 5 hours 40 minutes gives 16:50, but since the first interval ends at 11:40, the additional minutes after that are 20 minutes into the next hour, total 13 hours 20 minutes, which is 13:20.
