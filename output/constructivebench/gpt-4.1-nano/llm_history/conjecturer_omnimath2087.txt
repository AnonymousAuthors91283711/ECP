Based on the enumerated patterns, the minimal c satisfying these constraints is c = 126, derived from the divisibility conditions and the triangle inequalities. The minimal such c consistent with the divisibility constraints (a divisible by 42 and b divisible by 72) and the triangle inequalities is c = 126. 

<<<126>>>
