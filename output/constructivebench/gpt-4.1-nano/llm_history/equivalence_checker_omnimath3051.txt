Ground Truth Answer: 17
Proposed Answer: 25
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have a function f: ℕ → ℕ with:
   - f(2) = 5
   - f(3) = 7
   - f(m) + f(n) = f(m*n) for m,n > 0

2. We need to find f(12)

3. Ground truth answer is 17
4. Proposed answer is 25

Let's verify:

First, note that 12 = 2*2*3

Using the functional equation:
f(2*2) = f(2) + f(2) = 5 + 5 = 10
Then f(12) = f(4*3) = f(4) + f(3) = 10 + 7 = 17

The proposed answer 25 would require a different calculation path that doesn't match the given conditions. For example, if someone mistakenly thought f(12) = f(2) + f(6) and then incorrectly calculated f(6), they might get 25, but this would violate the given conditions.
