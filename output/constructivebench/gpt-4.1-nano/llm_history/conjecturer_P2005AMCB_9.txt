theorem P2005AMCB_9 : 
  let scores := [70, 80, 85, 90, 95]
  let weights := [0.1, 0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.3]
  let mean := ∑ i in Finset.range 5, weights[i]! * scores[i]!
  let median := 85
  mean - median = P2005AMCB_9_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the provided scores and weights, the weighted mean is approximately 85.25, since the weighted sums are (70*0.1 + 80*0.25 + 85*0.2 + 90*0.15 + 95*0.3) = 7 + 20 + 17 + 13.5 + 28.5 = 86, and dividing by 1 (due to weights summing to 1), the mean is 85.25. The difference between mean and median (85) is therefore 0.25.
