theorem P2014AMCB_1 :
  ∃ p n : ℕ,
    p + n = 13 ∧
    n + 1 = p ∧
    p + 5 * n = P2014AMCB_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on pattern recognition, the second condition n + 1 = p implies p = n + 1. Substituting into p + n = 13 gives n + 1 + n = 13 ⟹ 2n + 1 = 13 ⟹ 2n = 12 ⟹ n = 6. Then p = 7, and p + 5 * n = 7 + 30 = 37. 

Final answer: <<<37>>>
