The patterns suggest the answer involves special properties related to 2022 and 2021, particularly focusing on iterations involving minFac and primality. Observing that the sum is over specific n with constraints, and noting the typical form of such solutions, a reasonable conjecture is that the overall sum relates to a power of 2 multiplied by a constant. Based on typical results in similar problems, the sum likely evaluates to 2^11 = 2048, given the iteration depth and established patterns.
