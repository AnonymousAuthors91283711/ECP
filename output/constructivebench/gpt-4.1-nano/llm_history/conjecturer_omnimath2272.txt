Considering the problem involves functions from a finite set of size 4 to size 6, and counting those with a specific property regarding preimages of an element \(x\) in Fin 6, the answer simplifies to the probability of a random function from \( \{1,...,4\} \) to \( \{1,...,6\} \) having at least 3 elements mapped to some fixed \(x\), with an average over all choices of \(x\). This probability is symmetric and equivalently calculates as:

\[ \frac{6 \times \left( 6^4 - 2 \times 5^4 + 4^4 \right)}{6^4} \]

which simplifies to \(\frac{6 \times (6^4 - 2 \times 5^4 + 4^4)}{6^4}\)

In closed form, this yields:

<<<(6 * (6^4 - 2 * 5^4 + 4^4)) / 6^4>>>
