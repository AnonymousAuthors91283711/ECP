abbrev omnimath2805_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2805 :
  ((20 - 16) * (12 + 8) / 4 = omnimath2805_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern in the enumeration suggests the answer is a simple calculation involving the given numbers. Evaluating: ((20 - 16) * (12 + 8) / 4) = (4 * 20)/4 = 80/4 = 20. 
I conjecture the answer is 20.
