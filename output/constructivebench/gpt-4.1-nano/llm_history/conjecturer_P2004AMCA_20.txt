The condition `round(x.1 + x.2) = round x.1 + round x.2` holds exactly when `x.1 + x.2` and `x.1`, `x.2` satisfy the round addition properties, which occur when both `x.1`, `x.2` are within the same integer interval boundary, i.e., when `x.1` and `x.2` are in intervals like `[k, k+1)` with their sum in `[k, k+1)`. The only predictable average for the sum in `[0, 2]` where rounding sum equals sum of rounded parts is when `x.1, x.2` are in `[0, 1)`  with total in `[0, 2)`.

Hence, the proportion of the unit square where the sum is within these bounds:

The error in your current proposal stems from trying to assign a noncomputable term or a comment directly to a `noncomputable abbrev` without a proper expression: Lean expects an actual rational number (`ℚ`) after the colon, but instead, you have a comment or explanation. Additionally, the identifier `The` is unrecognized as Lean syntax.

To fix this, I will condense the reasoning into a closed-form rational number expression based on the measure (area) of the region in the unit square where `round(x₁ + x₂) = round x₁ + round x₂` holds. The reasoning suggests that this region corresponds roughly to configurations where `x₁, x₂ ∈ [0,1)` and their sum remains within `[0, 2)` with certain boundary considerations.

From the initial heuristic, (1/2)*1 = 1/2 appears as the proportion within this region. So, the rational number 1/2 is a natural candidate.

Therefore, the corrected answer is an explicit rational number, such as `1/2`.

Finally, the expression in Lean should be a straightforward rational, enclosed in the delimiters.
