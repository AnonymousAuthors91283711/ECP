The core of the problem involves analyzing the set of real shifts z that relate the points where cos x = 0 to those where cos(x + z) = 1/2. The key observations are:

- cos x = 0 occurs at x = π/2 + πk, for k ∈ ℤ.
- cos(x + z) = 1/2 occurs at x + z = ±π/3 + 2πm, for m ∈ ℤ.

From these, for each x = π/2 + πk, the shift z must satisfy:

cos(π/2 + πk + z) = 1/2.

Since cos(α + z) = 1/2 when α + z = ±π/3 + 2πm, substituting α = π/2 + πk:

π/2 + πk + z = ±π/3 + 2πm,

which gives:

z = -π/2 - πk ± π/3 + 2πm.

The minimal positive shift z occurs when choosing the +π/3 option, because the other will give larger shifts or negative shifts in absolute value.

Calculating this:

z = -π/2 - πk + π/3 + 2πm = (-π/2 + π/3) - πk + 2πm.

Simplify:

-π/2 + π/3 = -(3π/6) + (2π/6) = -(π/6).

Thus,

z = -π/6 - πk + 2πm.

The minimal nonnegative such z occurs when m = 0, k = 0:

z = -π/6.

But since we consider shifts z such that the set contains all such solutions (since the set is defined by the existentials), and since the question is about the infimum, and shifting by the minimal positive amount (which would be π/6), the infimum is at π/3, because the cosines are periodic with period 2π.

**Note:** The simplest, closed-form answer is to recognize the minimal positive shift occurs at π/3, which is derived from the phase difference between cos(π/2 + x) and cos(x).

**Fixing the Lean code:**

The error message points to the syntax: defining `abbrev` is an abbreviation, which must have the form:

`abbrev name : type := expression` .

You used `abbrev` followed by the name, then a colon, then `ℝ`, then `:=` and then a **description string**. That is incorrect; an abbreviation must be a real number, not a string, with the syntax:

```lean
abbrev name : ℝ := expression
```

The current code attempts:

```lean
abbrev P2006AMCA_15_answer : ℝ := sorry
```

with an immediate comment or string explaining the answer, which is invalid.

---

### Final Answer:

The minimal shift z is π/3, which can be generalized as follows:

```lean
<<<π / 3>>>
```

---

### Summary:

- The answer should be a real number, specifically, the constant π/3.
- The syntax error is caused by an invalid definition of the abbreviation with a comment string; it must be a Lean expression.

The error indicates that the declared abbreviation was malformed: it included the keyword 'abbrev' and tried to assign it as an expression directly, which is invalid syntax. The correct approach is to define a 'noncomputable' constant (say P2006AMCA_15_answer : ℝ) directly, without nesting 'abbrev' inside its assignment, and assign the known closed-form answer expression.

From the problem's structure and the enumerated answers, the set of z satisfying the cosine conditions corresponds to specific shifts related to the zeros and values of cosine. Specifically, the set involves points where cos x = 0 (which occurs at x = π/2 + kπ) leading to certain z's, and those z's are likely related to shifts like π/3, 2π/3, etc., considering cos(x+z)=1/2.

Analyzing the cosine equations:

- cos x = 0 at x = π/2 + kπ
- cos (x + z) = 1/2 at x+z = ±π/3 + 2kπ (standard positions)

Matching these with x = π/2 + kπ, the values of z correspond to:

z = (x + z) - x = (±π/3 + 2kπ) - (π/2 + kπ) = (±π/3) - π/2 + (2kπ - kπ) = (±π/3) - π/2 + kπ

Calculations:

- For +π/3: z = π/3 - π/2 + kπ = (2π/6 - 3π/6) + kπ = (-π/6) + kπ
- For -π/3: z = -π/3 - π/2 + kπ = (-2π/6 - 3π/6) + kπ = (-5π/6) + kπ

Similarly, shifting x by these amounts, the set of z satisfying the conditions is exactly all z in the set:

z ∈ {−π/6 + kπ | k ∈ ℤ} ∪ {−5π/6 + kπ | k ∈ ℤ}

Hence, the infimum over this set is the minimal element, which is −π/6, since the set contains all shifts of these types for integers k, with unboundedness in both directions.

Therefore, the closed-form answer is:

-π/6

Final lean code (corrected):

<<<-π/6>>>

This matches with the patterns expressed in the enumerated answers and is a classic solution for such cosine shift problems.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error occurs because `π` is not predefined in Lean's standard library. In Lean, the mathematical constant pi is typically represented as `Real.pi`. To fix the error and define `P2006AMCA_15_answer` as \(-\pi/6\), we should use `Real.pi` instead of `π`. 

This substitution ensures the code compiles correctly and maintains the intended value. Additionally, because `π/6` is a rational multiple of the real `pi`, no other adjustments are required for type correctness.

Given the problem context and the pattern of the expected answer, the correct fixed form of the answer will be:

<<<-Real.pi / 6>>>

This expression precisely captures \(-\pi/6\) and conforms to Lean's syntax and naming conventions.

**Final answer:**

<<<-Real.pi / 6>>>
