    (X ^ 2 + 12 * X + C c).IsRoot (omnimath2716_answer c) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℤ → ℤ
Given that 18 is a root of the quadratic polynomial \(X^2 + 12X + C c\), the quadratic formula yields the root \(-6 \pm \sqrt{36 - C c}\). For the root to be an integer, \(36 - C c\) must be a perfect square, specifically \(k^2\). Thus, the root (answer) simplifies to \(-6 \pm k\). The provided pattern suggests choosing \(k\) as \(6 - c\), resulting in \(-6 + (6 - c) = -c\). Therefore, the answer simplifies to \(- c\).
