abbrev omnimath2817_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2817 (x : ℝ) : (10 : ℝ)^x * (10 : ℝ)^5 = (100 : ℝ)^4 ↔ x = omnimath2817_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the pattern that \((10)^x \times (10)^5 = (100)^4\) simplifies to \(10^{x + 5} = 10^{8}\), the solution for \(x\) is \(8 - 5 = 3\).
