theorem olympiadbench2248
(f g : ℝ → ℝ)
(hfg : ∀ x : ℝ, f x + g x = 3 * x + 5 ∧ f x - g x = 5 * x + 7)
: 2 * (f 2) * (g 2) = olympiadbench2248_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The equations imply solving for f 2 and g 2:  
f x + g x = 3 x + 5  
f x - g x = 5 x + 7  
Adding: 2 f x = 8 x + 12 ⇒ f x = 4 x + 6  
Subtracting: 2 g x = -2 x - 2 ⇒ g x = - x - 1  
At x=2: f 2 = 8 + 6 = 14, g 2 = -2 - 1 = -3  
Product: 2 * 14 * (-3) = -84  
Answer: <<< -84 >>>
