The current proposed answer is written as a natural language explanation, not in the syntax of Lean, and uses the word "The" at the start which causes an error because Lean interprets this as an identifier. To fix this, the answer should be properly expressed as a set of real numbers with the appropriate Lean syntax, capturing the set of initial values \(a\) that do *not* lead to the sequence divergence, i.e., those not equal to the fixed points.

From the description, the sequence's fixed points are solutions to the quadratic:
\[
L = \frac{1 - \alpha \beta \pm \sqrt{(1 - \alpha \beta)^2 - 4 \alpha}}{2 \beta}
\]
and the set of initial values \(a\) for which the sequence cannot escape the fixed points (or don't converge to them) would be those equal to either of these solutions.

Because of the "±" in the formula, the fixed points are two real solutions, provided the discriminant is non-negative. Assuming that, the set of initial \(a\) that make the sequence stay at or avoid diverging from these fixed points is precisely two points: these are the fixed points themselves.

The formula for the fixed points:
\[
L_1 = \frac{1 - \alpha \beta + \sqrt{(1 - \alpha \beta)^2 - 4 \alpha}}{2 \beta} \quad \text{and} \quad L_2 = \frac{1 - \alpha \beta - \sqrt{(1 - \alpha \beta)^2 - 4 \alpha}}{2 \beta}
\]

The answer set then consists of the two fixed points, i.e.,
\[
\{ L_1, L_2 \}
\]

Expressed in Lean, the set should be written using `Set` notation as `{ a : ℝ | a = L_1 ∨ a = L_2 }`, with the expressions for \(L_1, L_2\).

The error in your Lean code stems from using Greek letter variables `α` and `β` without declaring them. In Lean, these are not recognized identifiers unless explicitly introduced. To correct this, you should replace `α` and `β` with variables or parameters named, for example, `a` and `b`, which are common in Lean and already used as function parameters.

Since the context involves parameters `α` and `β`, I recommend defining a fixed set expression parametrized by these values, using `a` and `b` as variable names locally. The expression matches the quadratic solutions of a certain recurrence, and from the pattern of the answer, it appears to involve the roots of the quadratic:

\[ x = \frac{1 - \alpha \beta \pm \sqrt{(1 - \alpha \beta)^2 - 4 \alpha}}{2 \beta} \]

In Lean, this can be expressed as:

```lean
{ a : ℝ | a = (1 - α * β + sqrt ((1 - α * β)^2 - 4 * α)) / (2 * β) ∨ a = (1 - α * β - sqrt ((1 - α * β)^2 - 4 * α)) / (2 * β) }
```

Hence, replace all `α` with `α` and `β` with `β`, assuming they are parameters of your theorem, which is valid because the parameters are in scope. If they are not, you should declare them as parameters in your expression.

Final fixed code:

<<<
{ a : ℝ | a = (1 - α * β + sqrt ((1 - α * β)^2 - 4 * α)) / (2 * β) ∨ a = (1 - α * β - sqrt ((1 - α * β)^2 - 4 * α)) / (2 * β) }
>>>
