abbrev omnimath2670_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2670 (x : ℝ) : sqrt (100 - x) = 9 ↔ x = omnimath2670_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the equation sqrt(100 - x) = 9, squaring both sides yields 100 - x = 81, so x = 19. To match the theorem, the answer must be a real number satisfying this equality and within the domain. The simplified and closed form answer is 19.
