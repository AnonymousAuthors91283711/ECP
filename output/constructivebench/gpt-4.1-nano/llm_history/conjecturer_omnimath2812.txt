theorem omnimath2812 :
  (let x : ℝ := 2;
   (x + 2 - x) * (2 - x - 2) = omnimath2812_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The expression simplifies to (x + 2 - x) * (2 - x - 2) = 2 * (-x) = -2x. For x=2, this becomes -2*2 = -4. The answer appears to be the constant value -4.
