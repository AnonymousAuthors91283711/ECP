Ground Truth Answer: {(3, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(p, q) | p = 1 + q^2 ∧ p = q + q^2}
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is asking for pairs of prime numbers (p,q) where:
1. p and q are both prime
2. p-q is a perfect square
3. p*q-q is a perfect square

The ground truth answer gives just one pair (3,2). Let's verify this:
- Both 3 and 2 are prime
- 3-2 = 1 which is 1² (perfect square)
- 3*2-2 = 4 which is 2² (perfect square)

Now let's examine the proposed answer {(p, q) | p = 1 + q² ∧ p = q + q²}:
1. The two conditions imply 1 + q² = q + q² ⇒ 1 = q ⇒ q = 1
2. But 1 is not a prime number
3. Therefore, this set is empty and doesn't match the ground truth

The proposed answer leads to no valid solutions, while the ground truth has one valid solution. They are not equivalent.
