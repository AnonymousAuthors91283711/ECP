abbrev omnimath3372_answer : ℕ → Rat := sorry
theorem omnimath3372 (n : ℕ) (hn : n ≠ 0) : 
  (1 / n) = omnimath3372_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → Rat
Given the pattern in enumerated answers and the relation (1 / n), the function likely simplifies to n^{-1} in rationals. 

Final answer:

<<<fun n : ℕ => (n : Rat)⁻¹>>>
