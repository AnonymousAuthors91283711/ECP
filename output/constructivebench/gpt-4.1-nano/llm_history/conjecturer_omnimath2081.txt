The fourth iterate of the quadratic function \(f(x) = x^2 + 6x + 7\) applied to some \(x\). Completing the pattern of iteration, the explicit formula is \(((x + 3)^2 + 1)^2 + 6((x + 3)^2 + 1) + 7\), expanded as \(((x + 3)^2 + 1)^2 + 6((x + 3)^2 + 1) + 7\). To find the minimal value over all \(x \in \mathbb{R}\), note that the minimal occurs when the inner term is minimized, and the minimal value of \(((x + 3)^2 + 1)^2 + 6((x + 3)^2 + 1) + 7\) is attained at \(((x+\text{some})^2 + 1) = 0\), i.e., \(x = -3\).

Thus, the minimal value is \(1^2 + 6 \times 1 + 7 = 1 + 6 + 7 = 14\). The least value is achieved when the inner term is minimized, giving \(14\).

Hence, the answer is 14 in ℝ.
