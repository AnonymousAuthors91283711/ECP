The sequence appears to be based on a geometric progression with equal differences. From the relations, the sequence is arithmetic and geometric, implying all terms are proportional. The common ratio is derived from the nature of the geometric progression, leading to the ratio between a and d.  
In particular, the relation b/a = d/b implies (b)^2 = a * d. Since the sequence is arithmetic, c = (a + d) / 2. The expression a/d simplifies to a form involving powers of 2, reflecting the geometric progression's properties.  
Conjectured final answer: <<<1/4>>>
