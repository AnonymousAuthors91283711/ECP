Ground Truth Answer: 115440
Proposed Answer: (6001 * 300) + (300 * 299) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem is asking for the greatest possible sum of g(k) from k=0 to 6000 under certain constraints. The constraints involve:
1. f being non-increasing up to n=300
2. f(300) ≥ 0
3. Sum of f(k) from 0 to 300 ≤ 300
4. g being subadditive with respect to f

The proposed answer suggests (6001 * 300) + (300 * 299)/2, which simplifies to:
6001*300 = 1,800,300
300*299/2 = 44,850
Total = 1,845,150

This is vastly larger than the ground truth answer of 115,440. The proposed answer appears to be an incorrect upper bound calculation that doesn't properly account for the constraints on f and g.

The correct approach would involve carefully constructing f and g to maximize the sum while respecting all constraints, which leads to the much smaller ground truth answer.
