The conditions simplify as follows: since (n - 20) % 4 = 0, set (n - 20) = 4k with k ≥ 0. Then, 13 + k = n / 2, so n = 2(13 + k) = 26 + 2k. Substituting back, (26 + 2k - 20) = 4k, which is always true, with n > 20 implying k ≥ 0. The minimal n occurs at k=0: n=26. 

Thus, the least n satisfying all conditions is 26.
