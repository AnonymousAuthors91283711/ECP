Ground Truth Answer: -1 / 2
Proposed Answer: 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a property P(x,y) as (y + x) = (y - x)² + 3(y - x) + 3
2. It asks for the least y such that there exists an x making P(x,y) true
3. The ground truth answer is -1/2
4. The proposed answer is 2

To check equivalence, let's solve the problem:

First, simplify P(x,y):
(y + x) = (y - x)² + 3(y - x) + 3
Let u = y - x, then y + x = y - x + 2x = u + 2x
So: u + 2x = u² + 3u + 3
But u = y - x ⇒ x = y - u
Substitute: u + 2(y - u) = u² + 3u + 3
Simplify: 2y - u = u² + 3u + 3
Rearrange: u² + 4u + 3 - 2y = 0

For real solutions to exist, discriminant must be ≥ 0:
(4)² - 4(1)(3 - 2y) ≥ 0 ⇒ 16 - 12 + 8y ≥ 0 ⇒ 4 + 8y ≥ 0 ⇒ y ≥ -1/2

Thus the minimal y is indeed -1/2, not 2. The proposed answer is incorrect.
