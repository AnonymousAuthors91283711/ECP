theorem P2003AMCA_1 (n : ℕ) :
  (∑ k in Finset.range n, 2*(k+1)) - (∑ k in Finset.range n, 2*k + 1) = P2003AMCA_1_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The sum of 2(k+1) from 0 to n-1 is 2∑ (k+1) = 2 * (n(n+1)/2) = n(n+1). 
The sum of (2k+1) from 0 to n-1 is 2∑k + ∑1 = 2 * (n(n-1)/2) + n = n(n-1) + n = n^2.
Difference = n(n+1) - n^2 = n, which generalizes to n ≥ 0.
