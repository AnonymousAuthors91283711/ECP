The pattern in the enumerated answers suggests the maximum of k occurs when m and n satisfy certain extremal conditions, with n and m within the interval [1, 1981], and the constraint (n^2 - m n - m^2)^2 = 1 suggests (n^2 - m n - m^2) is ±1, relating to Pell-type equations. The pairing of m and n that maximizes m^2 + n^2 occurs at boundary values with one as large as possible within [1, 1981]. Testing the boundary case n = 1981, m = 1 yields k = m^2 + n^2 = 1 + 1981^2.

This pattern indicates the maximum value of k is achieved when m = 1 and n = 1981.

Thus, the maximum k is 1 + 1981^2.
