Ground Truth Answer: 720
Proposed Answer: 60
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a sequence of operations where we start with a number n, and each day we subtract a fraction of the remaining amount:
   - Day1: subtract half
   - Day2: subtract two-thirds of remainder
   - Day3: subtract three-quarters of remainder
   - Day4: subtract four-fifths of remainder
   - Day5: subtract five-sixths of remainder
   - Final remainder should be 1

2. The ground truth answer is 720, which is the least number satisfying these conditions.

3. The proposed answer is 60.

Let's test the proposed answer (60):
- Day1: 60 - 60/2 = 30
- Day2: 30 - 30*2/3 = 10
- Day3: 10 - 10*3/4 = 2.5 (not an integer)
- Already fails at day3 since we can't have fractional remainders in natural numbers.

The correct answer should be divisible by denominators at each step (2,3,4,5,6), hence LCM(2,3,4,5,6)=60 is a candidate, but as we saw, it fails. The correct minimal solution is 720 (60*12), which works through all steps with integer values.
