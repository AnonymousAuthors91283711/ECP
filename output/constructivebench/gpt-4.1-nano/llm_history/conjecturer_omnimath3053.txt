theorem omnimath3053 (g : ℝ) (h : g > 0) : 
    g^2 - 6^2 = 45 ↔ g = omnimath3053_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The equation \(g^2 - 36 = 45\) simplifies to \(g^2 = 81\), so \(g = \pm 9\). The problem asks for a specific answer, presumably the positive root due to context \(h : g > 0\). The relevant answer is \(9\).
