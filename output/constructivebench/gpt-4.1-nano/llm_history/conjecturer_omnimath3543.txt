  (1 / 2 + 2 / 4 + 4 / 8 + 8 / 16 = omnimath3543_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern shows a geometric series with ratio 1/2, starting from 1/2, doubling the numerator each term. Summing the series: sum_{k=1}^∞ (2^{k-1} / 2^k) = sum_{k=1}^∞ (1 / 2) = 1. |Answer: 1|
