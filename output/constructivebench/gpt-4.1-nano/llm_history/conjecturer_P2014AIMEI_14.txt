Based on the enumeration pattern and the structure of the problem, the greatest x satisfying the rational sum to quadratic condition appears to be of the form a + sqrt (b + sqrt c). The sum constraint suggests specific integers. The pattern indicates the solution converges to a form akin to 132 + sqrt(132 + sqrt(263)). 

Therefore, the answer should be:

<<<132 + sqrt (132 + sqrt 263)>>>

This form satisfies the structure and the sum constraint, aligning with the pattern seen in the enumeration.
