: (∃! x : ℝ, 0 < x ∧ x < 90 ∧ (90 - x) = 0.25 * (180 - x)) ∧ (P2002AMCA_4_answer > 0 ∧ P2002AMCA_4_answer < 90 ∧ (90 - P2002AMCA_4_answer) = 0.25 * (180 - P2002AMCA_4_answer)) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the equation (90 - x) = 0.25 * (180 - x), solving yields x = 60 degrees; the unique solution in (0,90). The answer satisfies the same relation, so it's the same value due to uniqueness.
