theorem omnimath1286 : 
  ∃ (p q r s : ℕ), p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ r.Prime ∧ s.Prime ∧ 27000001 = p * q * r * s ∧ p + q + r + s = omnimath1286_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern, the product of four distinct primes around 27000001, with their sum providing the answer, suggests the primes are small, close or factor easily. Dividing 27000001 into four prime factors, balancing sum and product, likely leads to primes near 80,000 each. Therefore, the sum should be roughly 4 * 80,000 = 320,000. 

Answer: <<<320000>>>
