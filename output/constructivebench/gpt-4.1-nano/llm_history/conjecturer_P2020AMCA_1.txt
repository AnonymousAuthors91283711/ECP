abbrev P2020AMCA_1_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2020AMCA_1 : 
  let remainder := 1 - 7/10
  let maria_took := (1/3) * remainder
  1 - 7/10 - maria_took = P2020AMCA_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The expression calculates the difference \(1 - \frac{7}{10} - \frac{1}{3} \times (1 - \frac{7}{10})\), which simplifies to \(\left(1 - \frac{7}{10}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right)\), and further reduces to \(\frac{3}{10} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5}\).
<<<(1 - 7/10) * (1 - 1/3)>>>
