Given the modular condition involving powers, the smallest positive n satisfying 3^n ≡ 1 (mod 143^2) involves analyzing the order of 3 modulo 143^2. Since 143 = 11 × 13, and both 11 and 13 are prime, the order of 3 modulo each prime divides p - 1, leading to lcm of orders being the minimal n satisfying both conditions. The least common multiple is 120.
