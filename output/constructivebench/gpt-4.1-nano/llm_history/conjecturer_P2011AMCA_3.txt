The pattern suggests the minimal n for which some k's summing to at least 500, scaled by 35, occurs. Since ∑ i, k i * 35 ≥ 500 implies ∑ i, k i ≥ 500/35 ≈ 14.29, the minimal total of k's, which are non-negative, must be at least 15. For the minimal n, assign k i = 1 for i=1..15, sum=15, then 15*35=525 ≥ 500. So, n = 15 suffices with k i=1, which is minimal. No smaller n can satisfy because fewer positions means sum of k's can't reach 15 or more. 

Thus, the minimal n is 15. 

The corresponding answer in formal Lean form: 

<<<15>>>
