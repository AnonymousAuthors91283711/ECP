Ground Truth Answer: {2, -6 - 4 * Real.sqrt 2}
Proposed Answer: {a | a = 3 - 3 * Real.sqrt 2}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives two equations for S4 and S8 in terms of a and r, and asks for the condition on a when S4 and S8 take specific values involving √2.

2. The ground truth answer gives two possible values for a: 2 and -6-4√2.

3. The proposed answer gives only one solution: a = 3-3√2.

Comparing the answers:
- The proposed answer is missing one solution (a=2)
- The given solution (3-3√2) is not equivalent to either of the ground truth solutions
- The proposed answer doesn't match either the form or content of the ground truth answer
