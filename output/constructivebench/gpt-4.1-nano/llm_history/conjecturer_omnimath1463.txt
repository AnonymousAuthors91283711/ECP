The problem involves injective functions from Fin 4 to Fin 9 satisfying specific inequalities. The constraints imply that q(1) is less than q(0) and q(2), with q(1) also distinct from q(0) and q(2), and q(3) is greater than q(2). Considering these, the minimal q(1) is 0, q(2) at least 1, and q(3) greater than q(2). Counting configurations yields the total count as (N-2) * (N-3), where N=9. Final answer:

<<<(9 - 2) * (9 - 3)>>>
