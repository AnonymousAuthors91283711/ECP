Ground Truth Answer: 1/3
Proposed Answer: 1/2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum possible ratio of the smallest piece when a circle is cut by two distinct points (angles θ₁ and θ₂).

2. The ground truth answer is 1/3, which makes sense because:
   - The worst case for the smallest piece occurs when the three arcs are as equal as possible
   - With two cuts, the most balanced division gives three arcs of 2π/3 each
   - Therefore, the smallest piece would be 2π/3 out of 2π total, giving 1/3

3. The proposed answer is 1/2, which would imply:
   - One piece being half the circle (π) and the other two being π/2 each
   - But in this case, the smallest piece would be π/2, giving ratio 1/4 (not 1/2)
   - Or if considering two equal pieces of π each, but this violates the "smallest piece" condition

The proposed answer of 1/2 doesn't match the correct maximum ratio of 1/3.
