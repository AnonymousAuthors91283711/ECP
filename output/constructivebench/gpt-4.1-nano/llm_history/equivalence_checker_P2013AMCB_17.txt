Ground Truth Answer: 16 / 3
Proposed Answer: (2 * sqrt 3) / 3
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the difference between the supremum and infimum of the set of real numbers c that satisfy certain conditions involving a and b.

2. The conditions are:
   - a + b = 2 - c
   - a² + b² = 12 - c²

3. We can analyze this using the identity (a + b)² = a² + b² + 2ab:
   (2 - c)² = (12 - c²) + 2ab
   => 4 - 4c + c² = 12 - c² + 2ab
   => 2ab = 2c² - 4c - 8

4. For real solutions to exist, the discriminant must be non-negative:
   (a - b)² = (a + b)² - 4ab ≥ 0
   => (2 - c)² - 4(2c² - 4c - 8)/2 ≥ 0
   => 4 - 4c + c² - 4c² + 8c + 16 ≥ 0
   => -3c² + 4c + 20 ≥ 0
   => 3c² - 4c - 20 ≤ 0

5. Solving 3c² - 4c - 20 = 0 gives roots c = [4 ± √(16 + 240)]/6 = [4 ± 16]/6
   => c = 10/3 or c = -2

6. The parabola opens upward, so the inequality is satisfied between the roots: -2 ≤ c ≤ 10/3

7. Therefore:
   - Supremum = 10/3
   - Infimum = -2
   - Difference = 10/3 - (-2) = 16/3

The ground truth answer (16/3) is correct, while the proposed answer ((2 * sqrt 3)/3) is incorrect.
