The polynomial appears symmetric with pattern similar to (X - 1)^10 + (X + 1)^10, which has roots related to ±1. The sum of squares of roots of such symmetric polynomials often results in a real number involving binomial coefficients. Given the pattern and symmetry, the sum of squared roots is likely 20.
