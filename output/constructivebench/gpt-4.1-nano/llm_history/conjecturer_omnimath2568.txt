The pattern suggests the set should be infinite, and for any distinct elements \(a < b\), \(a + b\) is squarefree. A natural candidate is the set of all odd primes or an infinite subset with this property, such as all sufficiently large primes. To fulfill both conditions, the set of all primes excluding squares suits the squarefree requirement and is infinite.

  Infinite omnimath2568_answer ∧ ∀ a ∈ omnimath2568_answer, ∀ b ∈ omnimath2568_answer, a < b → Squarefree (a + b) := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: { n : ℕ | Prime n }. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 48, which is at "Prime n }" in "abbrev omnimath2568_answer : Set ℕ := { n : ℕ | Prime n }", there is an error: ambiguous, possible interpretations

The error arises because Lean cannot distinguish between `Prime n` from `Mathlib` and potentially other similarly named constructs, resulting in ambiguity. The enumerated answers hint that the intended set should be primes, confirmed by the context that primes are a natural infinite set and are well-known to be squarefree (except for the prime 4, but since 4 is not prime, it's not an issue). However, the main issue is the namespace ambiguity.

In `Mathlib`, `Prime` is usually defined within the namespace `Nat`: i.e., `Nat.Prime n`. This clarifies the interpretation.

Therefore, the correct answer uses `Nat.Prime` instead of just `Prime`. Since the set of all primes is infinite and all primes are squarefree (because they are prime, and no prime contains a square factor greater than 1), this set satisfies the properties.

Final answer outline:

1. Sets of prime numbers: `{ n : ℕ | Nat.Prime n }`.
2. This set is infinite.
3. The sum of any two primes is squarefree (when the primes are distinct), though for the purpose of a clean formal statement, we accept the set of all primes.

Given the above, the fixed and compact closed-form answer in Lean is:

<<<fun n : ℕ => n ∈ { n : ℕ | Nat.Prime n }>>>

which simplifies to:

<<<{ n : ℕ | Nat.Prime n }>>>

since this is a set, and the answer `omnimath2568_answer` encapsulates the set of primes.

**In conclusion:**

```lean
{ n : ℕ | Nat.Prime n }
```
