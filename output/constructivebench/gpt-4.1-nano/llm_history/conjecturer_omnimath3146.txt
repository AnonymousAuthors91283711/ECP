abbrev omnimath3146_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3146
: ∀ x : ℝ, (x + 1) ^ 2 - x ^ 2 = omnimath3146_answer x := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
The difference simplifies to 2x + 1; recognizing the pattern in enumerated answers confirms this linear form. Thus, the closed-form function is λ x, 2 * x + 1.
