noncomputable abbrev omnimath990_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath990 (a : ℝ) (ha : 1 < a) :
  HasSum (fun i : ℕ => (a * i) / (a^i)) (omnimath990_answer a) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a => (a / (1 - a))^2
Proposed Answer: fun a : ℝ => a / (a - 1)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the sum of an infinite series: Σ (a*i)/a^i for i from 1 to ∞, where a > 1.

2. The ground truth answer is (a/(1-a))², which can be rewritten as a²/(1-a)².

3. The proposed answer is a/(a-1).

Let's compute the correct sum:
The series can be written as a * Σ i*(1/a)^(i-1) * (1/a)
This is a known series where Σ i*x^(i-1) = 1/(1-x)² for |x| < 1
Here x = 1/a, and since a > 1, |x| < 1
So the sum becomes a * (1/(1-1/a)²) * (1/a) = 1/(1-1/a)² = a²/(a-1)²

The ground truth answer is a²/(1-a)², which is equivalent to a²/(a-1)² since (1-a)² = (a-1)².

The proposed answer is a/(a-1), which is different from a²/(a-1)².
