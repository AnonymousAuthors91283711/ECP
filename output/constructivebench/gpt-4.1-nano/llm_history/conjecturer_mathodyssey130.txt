<<<512>>>

This maximum size 512 arises from constructing an injective function with no further reductions, relating to partitions of a 4-element domain into 9×9×9×9 products, ensuring the injectivity cannot be extended to include a constant triple {(a, b, c)} within the range and covering all such combinations.
