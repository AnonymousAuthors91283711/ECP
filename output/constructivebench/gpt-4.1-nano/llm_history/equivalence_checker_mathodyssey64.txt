Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves a hyperbola defined by (x/a)² - (y/b)² = 1 with constraints on a and b.
2. There are conditions about points A and B on the hyperbola, a line l, and a point P on the y-axis.
3. The final goal is to find m + n where m and n are scaling factors in vector relationships.

The ground truth answer is 6, while the proposed answer is 2. These are clearly different numerical values. 

The problem involves complex geometric relationships and constraints, and without seeing the detailed derivation, we can't verify intermediate steps. However, the final answers being different (6 vs 2) suggests they are not equivalent.
