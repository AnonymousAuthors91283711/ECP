The pattern suggests the minimal solution (x, y) to the Pell equation x^2 - 29 y^2 = 1 corresponds to fundamental solutions, with s = x + y. The minimal solution for 29 is (x, y) = (6, 1), giving s = 6 + 1 = 7. The pattern of minimal solutions for Pell equations involves fundamental units; for the smallest solution, s is constant at 7.
