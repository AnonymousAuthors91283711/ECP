theorem omnimath2861 :
  let S := {qs : Fin 4 → ℕ | 2 * qs 0 + qs 1 + qs 2 + qs 3 = 4}
  let T := {qs ∈ S | qs 0 + qs 1 + qs 2 + qs 3 = 3}
  (Nat.card T : ℚ) / Nat.card S = omnimath2861_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The pattern in enumerated answers suggests the ratio tends towards 1/2 as the variables sum to 4 with constraints. Since T restricts to sum 3, closely half of S's configurations satisfy the sum condition, yielding a ratio of 1/2.
