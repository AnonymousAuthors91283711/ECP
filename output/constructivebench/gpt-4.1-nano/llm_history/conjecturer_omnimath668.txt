: IsLeast {k : ℕ | ∃ A : Set ℤ, (∀ m : ℤ, ∃ a ∈ A, ∃ n > 0, (a ^ n ≡ m [ZMOD 100])) ∧ (A.ncard : ℕ) = k} omnimath668_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests that the minimal size of a set \(A\) over integers that surjectively maps via powers modulo 100 is 21, based on the enumeration and typical covering number patterns in modular exponentiation. The answer is the smallest such \(k\). 

<<<21>>>
