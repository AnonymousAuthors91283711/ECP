The sequence s(n) satisfies a linear recurrence relation derived from the polynomial p, with roots and symmetric sums. The relation relates s(k+1) to previous terms with coefficients corresponding to the roots' sums. Solving the recurrence, the sum simplifies to (-3), reflecting the constant term and roots structure.
