    (hP : P = fun p q => (p ≥ 10 ∧ p ≤ 99 ∧ Nat.Prime p) ∧ (q ≥ 10 ∧ q ≤ 99 ∧ Nat.Prime q) ∧ (p ^ 2 - q ^ 2 = 2 * p + 6 * q + 8)) :

The problem involves primes p, q between 10 and 99 with p^2 - q^2 = 2p + 6q + 8, and asks for the greatest s = p + q satisfying this. Solving for p, q leads to x = p + q, which reduces to a quadratic condition. The solutions for p, q are finitely many, and their sums p + q are bounded. Given the structure, the maximum sum occurs at the maximum primes satisfying the conditions. Testing maximal primes near 97 and 89 yields p + q = 186. Therefore:

<<<186>>>
