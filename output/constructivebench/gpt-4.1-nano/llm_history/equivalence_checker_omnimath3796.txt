Ground Truth Answer: {3}
Proposed Answer: {p : ℕ | Nat.Prime p ∧ p % 3 = 2}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the set of prime numbers p where the equation x³ - 3x + 1 ≡ 0 mod p has exactly one solution in ZMod p.

2. Ground truth answer is {3}, meaning only the prime number 3 satisfies this condition.

3. Proposed answer claims it's all primes p where p ≡ 2 mod 3.

Let's verify:
- For p=3: x³ - 3x + 1 ≡ x³ + 1 ≡ (x+1)³ mod 3 (since 3x ≡ 0 and in characteristic 3). This has exactly one root (x=-1), so 3 should be included.
- For p=2: x³ - 3x + 1 ≡ x³ + x + 1 mod 2. Testing x=0,1: f(0)=1, f(1)=1. No roots, so p=2 shouldn't be included.
- For p=5 (which is 2 mod 3): Testing x=0,1,2,3,4 gives roots at x=1 and x=3, so two roots. This contradicts the proposed answer.

The proposed answer incorrectly includes primes p ≡ 2 mod 3, when in fact:
- Only p=3 satisfies the condition of having exactly one root
- Some primes ≡ 2 mod 3 (like 5) have multiple roots
- Some primes ≡ 1 mod 3 also have multiple roots
