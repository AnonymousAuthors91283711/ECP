The pattern suggests the minimal beans exceeding 2008 with beans mod 100 = 42 is just above 2008. To reach beans > 2008 with beans mod 100 = 42, beans = 2009 (since 2009 % 100 = 9 ≠ 42, so need 2100 + 42 = 2142 to satisfy). The minimal cost is when steps reach that value, considering the minimal steps needed. The pattern indicates total cost primarily depends on the number of steps, which effectively will be minimal for the smallest such beans over 2008 with matching residue.

Hence, the simplest minimal total cost aligning with the pattern and calculations would be 42 + 2000 (since 2000 steps pattern), giving us a value near 2142 beans, with minimal steps corresponding to adding required beans in steps. 

Final answer:
<<<2142>>>
