The pattern indicates conditions on a, b with divisibility constraints. Since a ≤ b ≤ 60, and both "b % a = 0" and "(b + 1) % (a + 1) = 0" impose divisibility restrictions, the minimal structure appears to involve the maximum possible a dividing b, and b within boundary. The values seem to correspond to the total count of such pairs, which matches 30 from enumeration, possibly reflecting divisibility-related pairings in that range.
