abbrev omnimath3097_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3097 (a : ℝ) : 
    (3 * a - 7) / (a - 2) = 2 ↔ a = omnimath3097_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The equation (3a - 7) / (a - 2) = 2 simplifies to 3a - 7 = 2(a - 2), which yields a = 3. The enumerated answers suggest the answer set is singleton. Therefore, the answer in Lean should be a constant 3.
