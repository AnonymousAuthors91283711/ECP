The problem asks for the count of functions from Fin 5 to Fin 6 with the property that for any i,j with |i - j| > 1 and < 4, f i ≠ f j. The pattern suggests excluding functions that violate the difference constraints, akin to avoiding certain consecutive constraints.

Given the enumeration, the pattern implies the total count relates to the number of arrangements akin to (6)^5 minus those with forbidden differences. 

Since the constraints are on differences between i and j for 1 < |i - j| < 4, which means |i - j| = 2 or 3, the functions can't assign the same value to indices 2 or 3 apart; effectively, this resembles coloring sequences with adjacency restrictions.

From these, the count aligns with 6 * 5^4; i.e., fixing the first value arbitrarily, then each subsequent position choosing from 5 options (excluding the previous value).

Thus, the closed form is 6 * 5^4.

<<<6 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5>>>
