The polynomial roots are 1/4, 1/2, 2, 4, and product of roots times leading coefficient is 1. The polynomial with these roots is P(x) = k(x - 1/4)(x - 1/2)(x - 2)(x - 4), with leading coefficient k. The product of roots is (1/4)(1/2)(2)(4)=1. To satisfy the product constraint: k * 1=1 ⇒ k=1. Evaluating at 0: P(0) = (0 - 1/4)(0 - 1/2)(0 - 2)(0 - 4)= (-1/4)(-1/2)(-2)(-4) = (1/4)(1/2)(2)(4)=1. Evaluating at 1: P(1)= (1-1/4)(1-1/2)(1-2)(1-4)= (3/4)(1/2)(-1)(-3)= (3/4)*(1/2)*3= (3/4)*(1/2)*3=  (3/4)*(3/2)= 9/8. To get P(1)=1, multiply polynomial by 8/9, so the polynomial is (8/9)(x-1/4)(x-1/2)(x-2)(x-4). The value at 0: P(0)= (8/9)*(1/4)(1/2)(2)(4)= (8/9)*1=8/9. But the evaluation must be 1, so the answer is 1. Final answer in Lean:

<<<(8/9)>>>
