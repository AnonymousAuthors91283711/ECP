Based on the pattern, "IsNasty" characterizes functions where no pair of distinct elements swap each other. Such functions are permutations without fixed transpositions, mainly 5-cycles or identity. Counting these, the only "nasty" functions are the 5-cycles, totaling (5-1)! = 24, and the identity. Since the identity is not "nasty," the total is 24.
