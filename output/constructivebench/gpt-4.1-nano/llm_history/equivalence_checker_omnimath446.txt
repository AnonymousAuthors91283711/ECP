Ground Truth Answer: 24
Proposed Answer: 50
Let's analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n where:
   - n > 0
   - The sum of squares from 1² to n² is divisible by 100

2. The sum of squares formula is: n(n+1)(2n+1)/6

3. For the sum to be divisible by 100, n(n+1)(2n+1) must be divisible by 600 (since 600 = 100×6)

4. Checking the ground truth answer (24):
   - Sum = 24×25×49/6 = 4900 which is divisible by 100 (4900/100 = 49)

5. Checking the proposed answer (50):
   - While 50×51×101/6 = 42925 is indeed divisible by 100 (42925/100 = 429.25), but 429.25 is not an integer
   - Wait, actually 50×51×101 = 257550, and 257550/6 = 42925 which is not divisible by 100
   - The correct sum for n=50 should be 50×51×101/6 = 42925, which is not divisible by 100

6. The smallest n satisfying the condition is indeed 24, not 50.
