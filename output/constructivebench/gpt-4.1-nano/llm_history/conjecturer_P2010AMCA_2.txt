  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | n = ∑ i in Finset.range 6, (100 - i)} P2010AMCA_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the sum \(\sum_{i=0}^{5} (100 - i)\), it simplifies to \(6 \times 100 - \sum_{i=0}^5 i = 600 - (0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) = 600 - 15 = 585\). 

Thus, the maximum n satisfying the condition is 585. 

The expression in Lean that captures this is:

<<<585>>>
