The problem seeks positive integers satisfying a divisibility condition related to a finite set of integers with size 6. The pattern suggests the solution focuses on the minimal such \(a\) that works universally. Given the pattern, the minimality and the problem structure, the answer is the set containing \(a=1\), since many divisibility properties hold with \(a=1\).
