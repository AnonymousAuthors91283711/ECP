theorem omnimath1561 : Nat.gcd (a_sequence 5000) (b_sequence 501) = omnimath1561_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the sequences may follow linear recurrence solutions related to their characteristic equations, with gcd perhaps reflecting dividing constants. The enumeration hints the final result is a fixed positive divisor, possibly 1 or a small number, independent of n for large inputs. Considering the sequences' recursive nature and initial values, gcd appears constant, likely 1.
