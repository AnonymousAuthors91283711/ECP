Given the symmetry and the structure of the problem involving sinusoidal identities, the critical value of a emerges from points where the relationships hold identically. The pattern in the enumeration suggests the consistent final answer is the sum of roots related to the roots of certain sinusoidal equations, which simplifies to 0 when considering symmetry.
