I conjecture the answer relates to the density of rational multiples and their fractional parts, which implies the negation is equivalent to the existence of such an irrational number. Based on the pattern, the statement involves no irrational x with fractional parts bounded away from zero after some N, leading to the equivalence with a simple property about rationals.

The key issue here is that in Lean, identifiers like 'I' are predefined, but in the context of your code, the 'I' from the comment is mistakenly interpreted as an identifier, leading to the unknown identifier error. To correct this, I will write the final answer expression more carefully, avoiding any unintended identifiers or tokens, and expressing the statement as a universal quantification over all real numbers, with the negation of the property about irrationals and the fractional parts.

The statement effectively says: For every real number x, it is not the case that x is irrational and beyond some N, the fractional parts of kx (for k from 1 to n) are all at least 1/(n+1). Its negation, therefore, asserts that either x is rational or such a threshold N does not exist.

The answer, expressed in Lean, should be a universal statement over all reals x (without referencing undefined identifiers), and it should clearly encapsulate the negation of the given property.

Final Answer:

<<<∀ x : ℝ, ¬ (Irrational x ∧ ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n > N, ∀ k : ℕ, 1 ≤ k ∧ k ≤ n → Int.fract (k * x) ≥ 1 / (n + 1))>>>
