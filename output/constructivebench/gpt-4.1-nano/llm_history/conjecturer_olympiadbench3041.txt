The roots of \( P \) are 2 and another value. Since \( P \) is quadratic and \( \deg P = 2 \), it factors as \( a(x-2)(x - r) \). \( P \) evaluates to zero at 2, and roots are 2 and 5, implying \( r=5 \), and the sum of roots is 7. The polynomial's value at 0 is \( a \times (-2) \times (-5) = 10a \). Normalizing \(a=1\), \( P(0) = 10 \).
