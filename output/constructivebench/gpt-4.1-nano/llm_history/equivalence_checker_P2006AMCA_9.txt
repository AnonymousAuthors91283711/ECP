Ground Truth Answer: 10
Proposed Answer: 13
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us:
   - pencilCost > eraserCost
   - 13*pencilCost + 3*eraserCost = 100
   - We need to find pencilCost + eraserCost

2. Solving the equation:
   - Let p = pencilCost, e = eraserCost
   - From 13p + 3e = 100, we can express e = (100 - 13p)/3
   - p must be chosen so that e is a natural number and p > e

3. Testing possible values:
   - p=7: e=(100-91)/3=3 → p+e=10 (valid since 7>3)
   - p=4: e=(100-52)/3=16 → but 4>16 is false
   - p=1: e=(100-13)/3=29 → but 1>29 is false
   - p=13: e=(100-169)/3=-23 → negative cost is invalid

The ground truth answer (10) is correct, while the proposed answer (13) is invalid (leads to negative eraser cost) and doesn't satisfy the conditions.

<<<False>>>
