Ground Truth Answer: [-7, -7, 18, -7, -7, -7, 18, -7, -7, 18, -7, -7, -7, 18, -7, -7]
Proposed Answer: [-1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1]
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
1. We need to find the longest list of non-zero integers where:
   - Every 7-element sublist has positive sum
   - Every 11-element sublist has negative sum

Ground Truth Answer:
- Length 16 list with pattern [-7, -7, 18, -7, -7, -7, 18, ...]
- This carefully balances negative and positive numbers to satisfy both conditions

Proposed Answer:
- Length 12 alternating [-1, 1, -1, ...]
- For 7-element sublists: Sum would be -1 (since 7 is odd)
- For 11-element sublists: Sum would be -1 (since 11 is odd)
- Issues:
  - 7-element sum is negative (should be positive)
  - Not the longest possible list (ground truth has length 16)

The proposed answer fails both the sum conditions and doesn't achieve maximal length.
