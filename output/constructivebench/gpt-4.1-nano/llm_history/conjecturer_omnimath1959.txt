theorem omnimath1959 : 
  IsLeast {r : ℚ | ∃ (a b c : ℕ), 1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 2011 ∧ 1 ≤ b ∧ b ≤ 2011 ∧ 1 ≤ c ∧ c ≤ 2011 ∧ r = (a * b + c) / (a + b + c)} omnimath1959_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The problem seeks a minimal rational number \( r \) represented by \(\frac{a b + c}{a + b + c}\) with \(1 \leq a, b, c \leq 2011\). To minimize \( r \), we want to minimize numerator relative to the denominator. Since the numerator involves the product \(a b + c\), choosing the smallest \(a, b, c=1\) should minimize the fraction, because increasing any of these values increases the fraction. The minimal value occurs at \(a=b=c=1\): \( r = \frac{(1)(1)+1}{1+1+1} = \frac{2}{3} \). 

Final answer:
<<<(2/3 : ℚ)>>>
