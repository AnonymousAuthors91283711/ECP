Given the definition, θ(n) counts elements x less than 2010 satisfying x^2 ≡ n mod 2010. Summing n * θ n over 0..2009 involves quadratic residues mod 2010, which are well-understood. Recognizing symmetry and properties of quadratic residues, the sum simplifies to 2010 times (2010 − 1)/2. Thus, the sum modulo 2010 is 0.
