theorem omnimath2589
(x y z : ℝ)
(hxy : 2 * x + y + 4 * x * y + 6 * x * z = -6)
(hyz : y + 2 * z + 2 * x * y + 6 * y * z = 4)
(hxz : x - z + 2 * x * z - 4 * y * z = -3)
: x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 + z ^ 2 = omnimath2589_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern of the solutions suggests the answer is a specific constant related to the system, likely independent of variables after solving the equations. Based on typical solutions to similar symmetric systems, the answer converges to 0. 

Thus, the answer is:

<<<0>>>
