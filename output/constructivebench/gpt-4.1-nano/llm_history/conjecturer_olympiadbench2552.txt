theorem olympiadbench2552 : 
  (2 : ℚ)/5 + 5/2 + 1/(2*5) = olympiadbench2552_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Given the pattern, summing the fractions yields a combined rational: (2/5) + (5/2) + (1/10). Find common denominator 10, sum numerator: (4/10) + (25/10) + (1/10) = 30/10 = 3. 

Thus, the answer is 3.
