(h m : ℕ)
(hm : 0 < m ∧ m < 60)
(hflight : (h * 60 + m) = (1 * 60 + 18) - (10 * 60 + 34))

The problem involves calculating the total time difference in minutes based on the given flight times and then summing hours and minutes to match the answer. From the enumerations, the pattern suggests subtracting the total minutes. The flight difference is (1:18) minus (10:34), which equals -196 minutes, but since hours and minutes are positive, adjusting yields 23:42. Then, summing hours and minutes: 23 + 42 = 65. 

Final answer in Lean form:
<<<23 + 42>>>
