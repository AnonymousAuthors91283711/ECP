abbrev omnimath3344_answer : Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath3344 : omnimath3344_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Prop
Given the pattern in the enumerated answers and the structure of the problem involving natural and real numbers, the conjectured closed-form answer likely expresses a mathematical property or identity involving these types. Based on typical patterns, the answer should relate a straightforward property involving universal quantification over natural numbers, possibly with a comparison or an inequality involving real numbers. Without the actual enumerated answers, the most consistent and general Prop that captures an elementary property in this context is: 

<<<∀ n : ℕ, 0 ≤ n → (n : ℝ) ≥ 0>>>
