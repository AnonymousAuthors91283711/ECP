  let euroToDollar := 1.3
  let dianaDollars := 500
  let etienneEuros := 400
  let etienneDollars := etienneEuros * euroToDollar
  100 * (etienneDollars - dianaDollars) / dianaDollars = P2012AMCB_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The calculation involves converting €400 to dollars, then finding the percentage difference relative to €500. The difference in dollars is 400 * 1.3 - 500 = 520 - 500 = 20. The percentage change is (20 / 500) * 100 = 4. So, the answer is 4.
