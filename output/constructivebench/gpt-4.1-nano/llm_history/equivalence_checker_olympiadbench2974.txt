Ground Truth Answer: 30
Proposed Answer: 14
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n > 10 where (2^n + n^2) mod 10 equals (2^10 + 10^2) mod 10.

2. First calculate (2^10 + 10^2) mod 10:
   - 2^10 = 1024 → 1024 mod 10 = 4
   - 10^2 = 100 → 100 mod 10 = 0
   - So we're looking for n where (2^n + n^2) mod 10 = 4

3. Check the proposed answer (14):
   - 2^14 = 16384 → 16384 mod 10 = 4
   - 14^2 = 196 → 196 mod 10 = 6
   - (4 + 6) mod 10 = 0 ≠ 4 → Doesn't satisfy the condition

4. Check the ground truth answer (30):
   - 2^30 mod 10: Powers of 2 cycle every 4 in the last digit (2,4,8,6)
     - 30 mod 4 = 2 → last digit is 4
   - 30^2 = 900 → 900 mod 10 = 0
   - (4 + 0) mod 10 = 4 → Satisfies the condition

The proposed answer (14) doesn't satisfy the condition while the ground truth answer (30) does.

<<<False>>>
