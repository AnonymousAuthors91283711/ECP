The problem indicates symmetry with sums and pairwise products; the extremal values occur at symmetric points. With the constraints, the extremum of the product \(a b c d\) occurs when two variables are equal (say \(a = b\)) and the others are chosen accordingly. Simplifying, the maximum occurs when \(a = b = 1\) and \(c = d = 0\), giving \(a b c d=0\). The minimum occurs similarly at symmetric configurations, resulting in a minimal product of \(-1\) when variables are \(\pm 1\). Hence, the extremal values are \(-1\) and \(0\).
