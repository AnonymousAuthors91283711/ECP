Given the structure of the problem, the numerator involves a fixed real component (√17) and the complex z, which lies on the unit circle (|z|=1). The denominator involves |i√19 - z|, with |z|=1. Simplify the ratio and observe that for all z on the unit circle, the ratio depends on the real parts.

Conjecture that the supremum occurs when z aligns to maximize (√17 - Re z). As z lies on the unit circle, Re z ∈ [-1, 1]. The maxima of numerator interval: from (√17 - 1) to (√17 + 1).

Given the ratio involving absolute differences, the maximum value is achieved at Re z = -1, leading to the final form:

<<<(sqrt 17 + 1) / (sqrt 19 + 1)>>

This expression generalizes the maximum ratio as the ratio of these two terms.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The core of the problem is to find the supremum of the ratio:

\[ r = \frac{|\sqrt{17} - z|}{|i \sqrt{19} - z|} \]

over all \( z \in \mathbb{C} \) with \( |z|=1 \). Since \( z \) lies on the unit circle, \( z = e^{i \theta} \), parameterized by the angle \( \theta \). 

- The numerator: \( |\sqrt{17} - z| \).

- The denominator: \( |i \sqrt{19} - z| \).

Express these in terms of \( \theta \):
- \( z = e^{i \theta} \), so \( |\sqrt{17} - e^{i \theta}| = \sqrt{(\sqrt{17} - \cos \theta)^2 + (\sin \theta)^2} = \sqrt{17 - 2 \sqrt{17} \cos \theta + 1} = \sqrt{18 - 2 \sqrt{17} \cos \theta } \).

- \( |i \sqrt{19} - e^{i \theta}| \):
Since \( i \sqrt{19} \) has real part 0 and imaginary part \( \sqrt{19} \), then:
\( |i \sqrt{19} - e^{i \theta}| = \sqrt{ (\;0 - \cos \theta)^2 + (\sqrt{19} - \sin \theta)^2 } \).
This expands to
\[ \sqrt{\cos^2 \theta + (\sqrt{19} - \sin \theta)^2} = \sqrt{\cos^2 \theta + 19 - 2 \sqrt{19} \sin \theta + \sin^2 \theta} = \sqrt{19 + 1 - 2 \sqrt{19} \sin \theta} = \sqrt{20 - 2 \sqrt{19} \sin \theta} \].

Thus, the ratio becomes:

\[ r (\theta) = \frac{\sqrt{18 - 2 \sqrt{17} \cos \theta }}{\sqrt{20 - 2 \sqrt{19} \sin \theta}} \].

To maximize this over \( \theta \), we look at the extrema of numerator and denominator.

- Numerator peaks when \( \cos \theta = -1 \), giving \( \sqrt{18 + 2 \sqrt{17}} \).

- Denominator is minimized when \( \sin \theta = 1 \), giving \( \sqrt{20 - 2 \sqrt{19}} \).

Therefore, the maximum ratio is:

\[ \frac{\sqrt{18 + 2 \sqrt{17}}}{\sqrt{20 - 2 \sqrt{19}}} = \sqrt{ \frac{18 + 2 \sqrt{17}}{20 - 2 \sqrt{19}} } \].

Simplifying numerator and denominator:

Numerator: \( 18 + 2 \sqrt{17} = 2 (9 + \sqrt{17}) \),

Denominator: \( 20 - 2 \sqrt{19} = 2 (10 - \sqrt{19}) \).

Thus, the ratio simplifies to:

\[ \sqrt{\frac{2 (9 + \sqrt{17})}{2 (10 - \sqrt{19})}} = \sqrt{ \frac{9 + \sqrt{17}}{10 - \sqrt{19}} } \].

Now, rationalize the denominator:

\[ \frac{9 + \sqrt{17}}{10 - \sqrt{19}} \times \frac{10 + \sqrt{19}}{10 + \sqrt{19}} = \frac{(9 + \sqrt{17})(10 + \sqrt{19})}{(10)^2 - (\sqrt{19})^2} = \frac{(9 + \sqrt{17})(10 + \sqrt{19})}{100 - 19} = \frac{(9 + \sqrt{17})(10 + \sqrt{19})}{81} \].

Although the rational form is more complicated, in the interest of a simple closed form and considering the initial pattern, the key is that the supremum of the ratio is essentially:

\[ \sqrt{ \frac{9 + \sqrt{17}}{10 - \sqrt{19}} } \].

Therefore, the answer (a single real number) is:

\[
\boxed{\sqrt{\frac{9 + \sqrt{17}}{10 - \sqrt{19}}}}
\]

In Lean, the general form (done in the pattern of the enumerated answers) is:

<<<sqrt ((9 + sqrt 17) / (10 - sqrt 19))>>>

This expression correctly captures the maximum ratio over all \( z \) on the unit circle, given the geometric considerations and symmetric extrema. It avoids relying solely on specific angle guesses and provides a clean, closed-form solution.
