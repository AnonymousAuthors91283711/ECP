The pattern suggests the expression involves the minimal possible real number satisfying the condition, with the floor terms fixed at integers. The minimal such n occurs when the floors are maximized, i.e., at the boundary. Thus, the answer is when ⌊sqrt n⌋ = 44 and ⌊n^(1/3)⌋ = 12, which implies n ≈ 44^2 = 1936 and n ≈ 12^3 = 1728. So, the minimal n satisfying the equation is roughly 1936, but slightly larger to satisfy the sum exactly. The exact minimal n corresponds to n = 44^2 + 12 = 1936 + 12 = 1948. Final educated guess: 

<<<1948>>>
