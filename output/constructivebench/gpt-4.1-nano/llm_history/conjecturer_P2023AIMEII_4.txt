    x + y + z = 1 ∧

    (hFin : Set.Finite S)
: ∑ x in hFin.toFinset, x^2 = P2023AIMEII_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the given constraints, observe that the sum of x, y, z is 1, their squares sum to 2, and their cubes sum to 3, which suggests symmetric polynomial relations. Testing symmetric solutions yields that each root must be equal to 1, and thus their squares sum to 3. The enumeration points to a sum of 3 for the squares. Therefore:
<<<3>>>
