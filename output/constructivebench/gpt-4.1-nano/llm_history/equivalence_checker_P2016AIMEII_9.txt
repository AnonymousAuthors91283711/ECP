Ground Truth Answer: 262
Proposed Answer:  (fun n => n * (n + 1) * 2^(n - 2)) 4 -- for some fixed n
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem is about finding a specific value (P2016AIMEII_9_answer) that satisfies certain conditions involving arithmetic and geometric sequences. The ground truth answer is given as 262.

The proposed answer is a function application: (fun n => n * (n + 1) * 2^(n - 2)) 4. Let's evaluate this:
- For n = 4: 4 * (4 + 1) * 2^(4 - 2) = 4 * 5 * 4 = 80

This evaluates to 80, which is not equal to the ground truth answer of 262. The proposed answer doesn't seem to relate to the problem's requirements about arithmetic and geometric sequences or the specific values 100 and 1000 mentioned in the theorem.
