open Matrix

abbrev omnimath2443_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath2443 (a : ℚ) :
  (∃ B : Matrix (Fin 4) (Fin 4) ℚ, B ^ 2 = !![a, -a, -1, 0; a, -a, 0, -1; 1, 0, a, -a; 0, 1, a, -a]) ↔ a = omnimath2443_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The matrix resembles a pattern involving roots of unity, suggesting that a must satisfy a quadratic relation derived from the minimal polynomial of the matrix. The eigenvalues likely relate to roots of unity, leading to the hypothesis that a = 1.
