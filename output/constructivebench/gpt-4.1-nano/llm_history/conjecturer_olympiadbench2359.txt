theorem olympiadbench2359 : 
  ∃! x : ℝ, 0 < x ∧ x * ⌊x⌋ = 17 ∧ x = olympiadbench2359_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Because the equation is \( x \cdot \lfloor x \rfloor = 17 \) with \( x > 0 \), and numerical analysis suggests \( x \) near \(\sqrt{17}\) and less than 5, the simplest closed form: \( \frac{17}{n} \) with \( n \in \mathbb{N} \le 4 \). The unique solution occurs when \( \lfloor x \rfloor = 4 \), implying \( x = 17 / 4 = 4.25 \). 

<<<4.25>>>
