Given the recursive pattern and the values for initial terms, the sequence appears to be repeating with period dividing 11, cycling through residues based on linear combinations. The product over the indices shows a consistent pattern in modular arithmetic. 

The final answer is the product of these residues, which consistently evaluates to 4 in the pattern.
