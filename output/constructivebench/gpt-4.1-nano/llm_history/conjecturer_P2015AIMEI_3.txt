The pattern relates to primes \( p \) for which \( 16p + 1 = n^3 \) with \( n \) integer. Testing the pattern suggests that the prime \( p \) is of the form \(\frac{n^3 - 1}{16}\). For such \( p \) to be prime, the plausible minimal \( n \) is 3, giving \( p = (3^3 - 1)/16 = (27 - 1)/16 = 26/16 \) not an integer. Next minimal \( n \) is 7, giving \( p = (7^3 - 1)/16 = (343 - 1)/16 = 342/16 = 21.375 \) not integer. Next \( n=17 \): \( (17^3 - 1)/16 = (4913 - 1)/16= 4912/16= 307 \), which is prime (known prime 307). So the prime answer is 307.

<<<307>>>
