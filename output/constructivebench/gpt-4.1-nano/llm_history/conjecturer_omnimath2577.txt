The expressions suggest relations among x, y, z, with z expressed as a function of x, y, or constants. Given the symmetry and the equations, the product w = x * y * z likely simplifies to a constant. Testing initial values indicates that the maximum value occurs when x, y, z satisfy the relations with specific substitutions resulting in w=1. Therefore, the greatest such w is 1.
