The given equation involves trigonometric functions with the parameter θ in (0, 2π]. To find solutions, note the periodicity of these functions; the key solutions often occur at angles where sine and cosine ratios match or at multiples of π/3. The enumeration suggests specific solutions related to these angles. Given symmetry and periodicity, the total solutions within one period are likely 3.
