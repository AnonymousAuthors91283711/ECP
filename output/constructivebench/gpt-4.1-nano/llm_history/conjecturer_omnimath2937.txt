theorem omnimath2937
: (3 * 3 * 5 * 5 * 7 * 9 = 3 * 3 * 7 * omnimath2937_answer * omnimath2937_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given pattern in enumerated answers, the left side factors appear in the right side expression's factors, with the answer (represented as `omnimath2937_answer`) fitting the remaining prime factors. The prime factors on the left are 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 9. The constant 9 equals 3^2, matching the prime 3 squared. Factoring and matching primes implies the answer must be the multiplicative part to balance the equation, which factors as 5 * 5 * 9 = 5^2 * 3^2. 

Answer: <<<25 * 9>>>
