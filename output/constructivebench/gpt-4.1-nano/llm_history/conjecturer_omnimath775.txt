The pattern suggests looking for the smallest N of the form a*(2a-1) with a ≥ 1 that satisfies the divisibility condition for 1 ≤ k ≤ 10. Since N = a*(2a-1) and N*(N-1)/2, this involves specific properties of these products. The smallest such N with the given conditions appears at a=1, giving N=1*(1)=1, but N>1, so a=2 yields N=2*(3)=6. For larger a, the value grows larger, but the least N satisfying all conditions for a ≥ 2 is when a=2, N=6. 

Considering the minimal N > 1, N = 6 fits all criteria, with the divisibility for all k≤10.
