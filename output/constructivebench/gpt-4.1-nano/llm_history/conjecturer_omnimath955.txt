The problem counts bijections \(f : Fin 10 \to Fin 10\) with \(\|f(i)-i\| \leq 1\), i.e., permutations close to the identity with distance 1. Such permutations are the identity and transpositions swapping adjacent elements. The number of such permutations equals 1 (identity) plus the number of adjacent transpositions, which is 9. Total = 1 + 9 = 10.
