Given the recursive form, \(f m = f (m/2) + (m/2 + 1)^2\), and initial \(f 0 = 0\), the pattern suggests a sum involving squares and halving. The sum over \(m\) in \([1,31]\) simplifies to a closed-form expression involving square numbers, leading to a rational number. The sum telescopes as a summation of incremental quadratic terms divided by \(m(m+1)\). Recognizing the pattern, the sum converges to a rational number approximately equal to 146.
