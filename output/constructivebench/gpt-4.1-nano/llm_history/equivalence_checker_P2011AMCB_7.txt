Ground Truth Answer: fun (x, y) => x / y
Proposed Answer: fun _ => (99 : ℚ) / 10
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem asks for the greatest rational number r that can be expressed as x/y where x and y are two-digit numbers (10-99) whose average is 60.

2. The ground truth answer correctly identifies that to maximize x/y, we should:
   - Maximize x (which would be 99)
   - Minimize y (which would be 21, since x+y must be 120 to average 60)
   - Therefore the maximum ratio is 99/21 = 33/7

3. The proposed answer suggests 99/10, which:
   - Uses the maximum x (99) correctly
   - But uses the minimum possible y (10), which violates the average condition (99+10=109, average is 54.5 ≠ 60)
   - The correct minimal y under constraints is 21 (since 99+21=120)
