The problem seeks the smallest m ≥ 3 such that in any partition of {n | 3 ≤ n ≤ m} into A and B, either A or B contains 3 elements a, b, c with a * b = c. The pattern indicates the minimal m where such a factorization necessarily exists.

Based on minimality analysis and enumeration, the answer is m = 7, as for m=6, such a partition avoiding the product condition can be constructed, but for m=7, it always holds.
