Given the Fibonacci recurrence and the quadratic equation \( x^{2010} = \text{fib}(2009) \times x + \text{fib}(2008) \), the roots correspond to the solutions of the quadratic \( x^2 - \text{fib}(2009) x - \text{fib}(2008) = 0 \). The solutions are \( \frac{\text{fib}(2009) \pm \sqrt{\text{fib}(2009)^2 + 4 \text{fib}(2008)}}{2} \); using Cassini's identity \( \text{fib}(n+1)^2 - \text{fib}(n) \text{fib}(n+2) = (-1)^n \), this simplifies to involving only Fibonacci numbers. The set contains exactly these two roots.

The proposed answer defines a set of pairs (φ, 1 - φ) with a condition φ = (1 + sqrt 5) / 2. However, it attempts to define a subset of ℝ as a set of pairs, which is incompatible with the expected type `Set ℝ`. To rectify this, I interpret the answer as the solution set for `x`, which is a set of real numbers satisfying the polynomial equation linked to Fibonacci numbers.

Since the equation involves Fibonacci numbers, and the relation resembles the characteristic polynomial of a Fibonacci-type recurrence, the solutions for x are likely related to the golden ratio φ and its conjugate ψ = (1 - sqrt 5) / 2.

The characteristic equation associated with the Fibonacci recurrence leads to roots:

x = (φ)^k and x = (ψ)^k for some k, or more precisely, the roots of the quadratic:

x^2 - x - 1 = 0, whose solutions are φ and ψ.

Given the equation `x^2010 = fib 2009 * x + fib 2008`, and the known relation between Fibonacci numbers and φ, ψ, the solutions for x are the roots of that quadratic, i.e., {φ, ψ}.

Thus, the set `omnimath3586_answer` should be {φ, ψ}.

Final Lean expression: 

```lean
<<<{φ, ψ}>>>
```

This states explicitly that the solution set is the set containing the two roots φ and ψ, consistent with the Fibonacci relations and characteristic polynomial solutions.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error arises because `abbrev omnimath3586_answer : Set ℝ :=` expects a term of type `Set ℝ` but instead received a syntax `<<<{φ, ψ}>>>` which is invalid in Lean. To define a set explicitly, use set notation or a characterization that confirms which real numbers satisfy the given equation.

Considering the form of the algebraic equation involving Fibonacci numbers and a quadratic form, the solution set for `x` in terms of Fibonacci roots looks like a quadratic equation:

\[ x^{2010} - \text{fib}(2009) \, x - \text{fib}(2008) = 0 \]

which can be rewritten as:

\[ x^{2010} = \text{fib}(2009) \, x + \text{fib}(2008) \]

The roots of this polynomial are those `x` satisfying the quadratic:

\[ x^2 - \text{fib}(2009) \, x - \text{fib}(2008) = 0 \]

since the original equation can be seen as likely stemming from a quadratic with roots involving Fibonacci numbers.

The solutions are thus the set of roots of this quadratic:

\[ x = \frac{\text{fib}(2009) \pm \sqrt{\text{fib}(2009)^2 + 4 \text{fib}(2008)}}{2} \]

Assuming the `fib` function is from `Mathlib`, we can define:

```lean
set {x : ℝ | x = (fib 2009 + sqrt (fib 2009)^2 + 4 * fib 2008) / 2 ∨ x = (fib 2009 - sqrt (fib 2009)^2 + 4 * fib 2008) / 2}
```

This captures the roots explicitly and enforces the set of solutions. Since the problem asks for a set that satisfies the equivalence and given the high power, the set of roots of this quadratic should characterize all solutions.

Now, implement this in Lean syntax for `Set ℝ`:

```lean
abbrev omnimath3586_answer : Set ℝ := 
 { x | x = (fib 2009 + sqrt (fib 2009)^2 + 4 * fib 2008) / 2 
     ∨ x = (fib 2009 - sqrt (fib 2009)^2 + 4 * fib 2008) / 2 }
```

This is a closed-form, explicit, and general answer that fits the problem’s set description.

**Final answer:**

<<<{ x | x = (fib 2009 + sqrt (fib 2009)^2 + 4 * fib 2008) / 2 ∨ x = (fib 2009 - sqrt (fib 2009)^2 + 4 * fib 2008) / 2 }>>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The core issue in the proposed answer is the ambiguity of the `sqrt` function when applied directly to expressions involving `fib` values, which are natural numbers (`ℕ`). The expression involves `sqrt (fib 2009)^2 + 4 * fib 2008`, which has ambiguity: whether `sqrt` is applied to `(fib 2009)^2` (a natural number) or to the entire sum. 

In Lean, `sqrt` for real numbers is available via `Real.sqrt`, so we need to explicitly state `Real.sqrt`. Additionally, the algebraic form suggests the roots of a quadratic equation, typical of solving for `x` in the form `x^2 - (fib 2009)*x + some_value = 0`. 

Given the quadratic roots formula:
\[ x = \frac{ \text{fib 2009} \pm \sqrt{(\text{fib 2009})^2 - 4 \times \text{fib 2008}} }{ 2 } \]
the pattern is clear: the roots involve `fib 2009 ± sqrt(fib 2009)^2 - 4 * fib 2008`, divided by 2.

Thus, the fixed answer:
- Uses `Real.sqrt` to prevent ambiguity.
- Corrects the discriminant to `fib 2009)^2 - 4 * fib 2008`.
- Ensures the expression is a set of real numbers.

Conjecture: These roots are precisely the solutions to the polynomial `x^2 - (fib 2009)x + fib 2008 = 0`, consistent with the given equivalence.

Final answer (closed form):

<<<{
  x : ℝ | x = (fib 2009 + Real.sqrt ((fib 2009)^2 - 4 * fib 2008)) / 2 ∨ x = (fib 2009 - Real.sqrt ((fib 2009)^2 - 4 * fib 2008)) / 2
