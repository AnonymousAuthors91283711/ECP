The pattern suggests a complex recursive relation involving binomials or polynomial growth. The initial value at a(1, n) = n^n and the relation implies a super-exponential behavior. Based on the provided pattern and typical growth, the answer for a 128, 1 should be 128^128 mod 10, which is 6 (since 128 ≡ 8 mod 10 and 8^8 ≡ 6 mod 10). So the answer is 6.

<<<6>>>

This matches computing 128^128 mod 10.
