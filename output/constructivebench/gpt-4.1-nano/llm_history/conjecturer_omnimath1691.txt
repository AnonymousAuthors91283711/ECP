The problem involves finding the number of integers \(b\) such that there exists a polynomial \(f\) over \(\mathbb{Z}\) satisfying \(f(2) = 2010\) and \(f(b) = 8\). The candidates for \(b\) are solutions to a finite difference polynomial equation constrained by these evaluations. Based on enumeration, the consistent pattern suggests the only \(b\) with solutions are \(b=2\) or \(b=2010\), leading to two such integers.

<<<2>>>

This matches the enumerated answer pattern and satisfies the scenario.
