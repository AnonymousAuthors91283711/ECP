The sequence has |x_k| = |x_{k-1} + 3| with initial x0=0, leading to alternating positive and negative values. The sum telescopes to a multiple of 3, with the total sum being the linear sum of these oscillations. The total sum over 2006 terms simplifies to a constant multiple of 3 times an integer. The minimal absolute sum occurs at the minimal absolute values, yielding a total sum of 3*(2006)/2 = 3*1003.  
Answer: <<<0>>>, since the minimal sum occurs when all summands cancel out, resulting in 0.
