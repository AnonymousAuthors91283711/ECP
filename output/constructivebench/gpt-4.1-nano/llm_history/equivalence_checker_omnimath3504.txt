abbrev omnimath3504_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3504 (x : ℝ) : 
  x / 2 < x^2 ∧ x^2 < x ↔ x ∈ omnimath3504_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {x | x / 2 < x^2 ∧ x^2 < x}
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℝ => (x > 1/2) ∧ (x < 1)
Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The problem asks for the set of real numbers x where x/2 < x² and x² < x.

2. The ground truth answer is indeed the set {x | x/2 < x² ∧ x² < x}, which is the direct translation of the problem statement.

3. The proposed answer claims this is equivalent to x > 1/2 ∧ x < 1.

Let's verify if these are equivalent:

- For x > 1/2 ∧ x < 1:
  - x/2 < x² holds (since for x > 1/2, x² grows faster than x/2)
  - x² < x holds (since for x < 1, squaring makes it smaller)

- However, the proposed answer misses:
  - Negative solutions: For x < 0, x/2 < x² always holds (as x² is positive and x/2 is negative), and x² < x holds when -1 < x < 0 (since x² < x when x is between -1 and 0)

Therefore, the proposed answer is incomplete as it misses the negative solutions. The correct set should include both (1/2 < x < 1) and (-1 < x < 0).
