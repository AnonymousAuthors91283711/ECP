The problem filters integers \(b\) with \(1 < b\), \(b \leq 41\), and \(41 < b^2\). To satisfy \(41 < b^2\), we need \(b > \sqrt{41}\), i.e., \(b \geq 7\). With the constraints, the eligible \(b\) are from 7 to 41 inclusive. The integers \(b\) in this range satisfy all conditions.  
Answer: <<<41 - 7 + 1>>>
