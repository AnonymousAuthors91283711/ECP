theorem P2002AMCB_2 (x : ℝ) : 
    (3 * x - 2) * (4 * x + 1) - ((3 * x - 2) * 4 * x) + 1 = P2002AMCB_2_answer x := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
The expression simplifies to a quadratic polynomial, eliminating the dependency on x after cancellations. The pattern indicates the answer is a constant function, specifically 1, since the algebra reduces the original expression to 1 regardless of x. Therefore, the generalized answer is a constant function returning 1 for all real x.
