The equation resembles a quadratic form in x and y. By fixing y and solving for x, the problem reduces to analyzing the discriminant for integer solutions. From enumeration, solutions appear at specific (x, y) pairs. The counts suggest y = 25, x = 20 or 21 satisfy the quadratic. Counting these gives 2 solutions, matching an identified pattern.
