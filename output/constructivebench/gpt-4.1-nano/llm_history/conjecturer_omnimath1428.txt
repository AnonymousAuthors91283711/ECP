abbrev omnimath1428_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1428
: {x : ℝ | x ^ 4 + (2 - x) ^ 4 = 34} = omnimath1428_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The pattern in enumerated answers suggests the solutions are roots of a quartic polynomial. The structure indicates symmetry and likely quadratic factors. Considering the form \(x^4 + (2 - x)^4 = 34\), solutions are \(x=1\) and \(x=-1\).  
Final closed-form set includes these real solutions.  
Answer: <<<{1, -1}>>>
