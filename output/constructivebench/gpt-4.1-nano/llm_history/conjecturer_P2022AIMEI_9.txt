Given the ratio of arrangements and the fact that arrangements are divisible by each other, the simplified form should be in lowest terms. The numerator seems to be the count of even arrangements (which is 5 * 2^5 * 6!) and the total arrangements 12! / 2^6, so dividing yields 5 * 2^5 * 6! divided by 12! / 2^6, simplified to 5, with numerator and denominator coprime.
