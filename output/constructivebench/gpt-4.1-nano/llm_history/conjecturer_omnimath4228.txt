  (n : ℕ) :
  (∃ x : ℤ, x^n + (2 + x)^n + (2 - x)^n = 0) ↔ n ∈ omnimath4228_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Since the sum involves symmetric expressions with powers, it simplifies significantly when n is odd (the sum of symmetric terms cancels) and fails when n is even. The pattern suggests the answer set contains all odd natural numbers.
