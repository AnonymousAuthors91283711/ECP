Given the pattern, the solutions likely involve linear functions with specific coefficients satisfying the inequality. The simplest candidate functions are affine: f(x) = x, or f(x) = 0, as they satisfy such functional inequalities. Extending this, constant functions might also work. The consistent solution set including the zero function and the identity function is probably the intended answer: all affine functions of the form f(x) = x + c where c satisfies the inequality constraints, but factoring in the pattern, the core solutions are probably just f(x) = x and f(x) = 0.

Therefore, the set of solutions is {f | f(x) = x ∨ f(x) = 0}.

Expression:

<<<{f | ∀ x, f x = x ∨ f x = 0}>>>
