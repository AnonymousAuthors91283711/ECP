The problem computes the sum of squares scaled by 49, modulo 10. Since the sum of k^2 from 1 to 49 is polynomial, rescaling by 49 and mod 10 simplifies to evaluating the sum modulo 10. The pattern and symmetry suggest that the sum's last digit depends primarily on the last digit of 49^2, which is 1, and the sum of the last digits of k^2 from 1 to 49.

The sum of k^2 mod 10 over a cycle of 10 is well-known: the last digits of squares cycle every 10 numbers, totaling 0 mod 10. Multiplying by 49^2 ≡ 1 mod 10 keeps the sum's last digit unchanged.

Thus, the total sum modulo 10 is 0.
