Ground Truth Answer: 1441 / 2016
Proposed Answer: (2015 * (4/5) * (12/13) * (30/31)) / 2016
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the probability that a randomly chosen number between 1 and 2016 is coprime with 2015.

2. First, factorize 2015: 2015 = 5 × 13 × 31

3. The ground truth answer is 1441/2016, which is the exact count of numbers coprime to 2015 in that range divided by 2016.

4. The proposed answer uses Euler's totient function approximation:
   φ(2015)/2016 = (2015 × (1-1/5) × (1-1/13) × (1-1/31))/2016
   = (2015 × (4/5) × (12/13) × (30/31))/2016

5. Calculating the proposed answer:
   (2015 × 4/5 × 12/13 × 30/31)/2016
   = (1612 × 30/31)/2016
   = (1560)/2016
   = 65/84 ≈ 0.7738

6. The ground truth answer 1441/2016 ≈ 0.7149

The answers are not equal (False), but they are related through different approaches to the problem. The proposed answer uses the theoretical totient function while the ground truth gives the exact count. However, they should be equal for this range since 2016 ≤ 2015, so the proposed answer is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
