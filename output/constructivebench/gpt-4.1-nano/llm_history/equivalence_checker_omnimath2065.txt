Ground Truth Answer: 60
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal sum a+b+c+d where:
   - All numbers are positive integers
   - gcd(a,c)=1 and gcd(b,d)=1
   - gcd(a,b)≠1, gcd(b,c)≠1, gcd(c,d)≠1, gcd(d,a)≠1

2. The ground truth answer is 60, which suggests there's a relatively large minimal sum that satisfies all conditions.

3. The proposed answer is 8, which would require finding four small numbers satisfying all conditions.

Let's try to find a counterexample with sum 8:
Possible candidates would be combinations of numbers like (2,2,2,2), (1,2,2,3), etc. None of these can satisfy all the gcd conditions simultaneously. For example:
- (2,2,2,2) fails gcd(a,c)=1 condition
- (1,2,2,3) fails gcd(a,b)≠1 condition (gcd(1,2)=1)
- (2,3,2,1) fails gcd(b,c)=1 condition (gcd(3,2)=1)

The smallest possible sum is indeed much larger than 8. The ground truth answer of 60 comes from numbers like (6,10,15,29) which satisfy all conditions.
