theorem P2003AMCB_2 (g p : ℝ) :
  g = p + 1 ∧ 14 * (g + p) = 546 ↔ g = P2003AMCB_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The system defines g = p + 1 and 14*(g + p) = 546. Substituting g, 14*(p + 1 + p) = 546, simplifies to 14*(2p + 1) = 546. Solving for p: 2p + 1 = 546/14 = 39, so p = 19, and g = 20. The expression for g, in terms of p, is g = p + 1, which becomes g = 20. Therefore, the final answer is a constant value g = 20, independent of p, as it has been explicitly computed.

<<<20>>>
