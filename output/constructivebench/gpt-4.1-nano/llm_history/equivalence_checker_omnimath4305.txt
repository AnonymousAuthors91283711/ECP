Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0, 0), (1, 2, 3), (4, 8, 6)}
Proposed Answer: {
  (x, y, z) | ∃ n : ℕ, repDigit x (2 * n) - repDigit y n = (repDigit z n) * (repDigit z n)
}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer captures the general form of the condition (repDigit x (2*n) - repDigit y n must be a perfect square equal to (repDigit z n)^2), but it doesn't properly account for:
1. The requirement that this must hold for all n (not just some n)
2. The digit constraints (x,y,z < 10)
3. The specific solutions found in the ground truth answer

The ground truth answer gives the exact solution set that satisfies all conditions, while the proposed answer is a more general (but incomplete) characterization.
