The recursive relation suggests that for n=1, a1 is a positive base, and at n=30, a30=30. The recurrence resembles a well-known pattern linked with factorial growth and floors. Given the pattern, the consistent base value is a1=1, and considering the recursion, the overall behavior implies the answer equals 30. The enumeration confirms this pattern.
