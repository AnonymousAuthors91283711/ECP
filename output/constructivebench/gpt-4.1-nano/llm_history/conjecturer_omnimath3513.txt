    (xvals : Set ℝ)
    (hxvals : xvals = {-2, -1 / 2, 0, 1 / 2, 2}) :
    {x ∈ xvals | x > x ^ 2} = omnimath3513_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The set of solutions relies on the inequality x > x². This holds for x in (−1, 1) and also includes points where x > 1. Within given xvals, the elements satisfying x > x² are {-1/2, 0, 1/2, 2}. The point -2 does not satisfy -2 > 4. So, the solution set is {-1/2, 0, 1/2, 2}.
