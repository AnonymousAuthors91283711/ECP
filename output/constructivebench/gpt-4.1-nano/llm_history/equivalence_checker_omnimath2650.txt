abbrev omnimath2650_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2650 : 
  (∑ k in Finset.range 2011, 2^(k * (k + 1) / 2)) % 7 = omnimath2650_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: (2 ^ ((2010 * 2011) / 2 + 2010)) - 1 % 7
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the sum of 2^(k(k+1)/2) from k=0 to 2010 modulo 7.

2. The ground truth answer is simply 1.

3. The proposed answer is (2^((2010*2011)/2 + 2010)) - 1 % 7, which appears to be trying to compute a closed-form expression.

Key observations:
- The proposed answer doesn't match the form of the original sum
- The exponent in the proposed answer is much larger than any term in the original sum
- The ground truth answer of 1 is correct because the sum modulo 7 cycles in a pattern that results in 1
- The proposed answer doesn't simplify to 1 modulo 7

The answers are not equivalent.
