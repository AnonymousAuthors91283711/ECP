Given that isPerfect n is defined via sum of divisors, for n-1 and n(n+1)/2 to both satisfy the perfection condition, the pattern of divisors sums suggests n must be 2. This makes the sum of divisors conditions hold since for n=2, sum of divisors matches 2* n and n(n+1)/2 complements divisors sum. Therefore, the answer is 2.
