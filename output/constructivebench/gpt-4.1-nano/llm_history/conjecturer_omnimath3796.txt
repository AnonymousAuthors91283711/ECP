abbrev omnimath3796_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3796 :
  {p : ℕ | Nat.Prime p ∧ ∃!a : ZMod p, (a : ZMod p)^3 - 3*(a : ZMod p) + 1 = 0} = omnimath3796_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The problem asks for prime p such that there exists exactly one element a in ZMod p satisfying a^3 - 3a + 1 = 0. Based on the unique solution pattern, for prime p, the equation has exactly one root iff p ≡ 2 mod 3, because then the polynomial has a single solution in the field. 

Thus, the answer set is all primes p where p ≡ 2 mod 3.
