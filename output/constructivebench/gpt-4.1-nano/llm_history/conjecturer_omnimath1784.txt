The key part connects the roots' symmetric sums with the polynomial identity, focusing on the value of b = rs + st + tr and the condition for the polynomial at -1.  
Since the polynomial factors as (x - r²)(x - s²)(x - t²), matching coefficients yields relations involving r, s, t.  
Given the symmetric sum and the constraint at x = -1, the maximum value for b occurs when roots satisfy certain symmetry, with the sum of products maximized when roots are aligned to get maximum rs + st + tr.  
Considering these, the maximum is achieved when r, s, t are chosen symmetrically, with r = s = t = 1 to satisfy the last condition.  
Thus, the maximum value of rs + st + tr is 3(1·1) = 3. 

Final answer: the supremum occurs at the maximum b = 3.
