The conditions resemble sums of squares with quadratic forms, hinting at specific algebraic relations. Observing the enumeration hints, the solutions appear to be those where \(a\) and \(b\) satisfy certain parametric relations derived from perfect square conditions. Generalizing from the pattern, the set includes pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying \(a^2 + 4b = m^2\) and \(b^2 + 4a = n^2\) for some integers \(m, n\). These relations imply that \(a\) and \(b\) must be integers where \(a\) and \(b\) are either both even or both odd, specifically aligning with the pattern where \(a = 2k\) and \(b = 2l\) for integers \(k, l \).

The key insight is that solutions arise where both quadratic forms are perfect squares, characteristically captured by the set of all pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a\) and \(b\) are integers satisfying the given quadratic conditions. A precise, parametrized expression representing all such \((a,b)\) pairs is \(\{(a, b) \mid a, b \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } (a+2b)^2 = a^2 + 4b\text{ or similar}\}\.

Thus, the closed form encompasses all pairs where these quadratic forms are perfect squares, which can be collectively written as:

The key insight is that the conditions \(a^2 + 4b = m^2\) and \(b^2 + 4a = n^2\) describe pairs \((a, b)\) such that both quadratic forms are perfect squares, which constrains \((a, b)\) to particular parametric families. From the initial analysis and the enumeration hints, solutions occur when \(a\) and \(b\) are even, ensuring the quadratic forms are integers squares, or when they fit specific parametrizations satisfying the sums of squares conditions.

Given that, a suitable closed form for the set is the collection of all integer pairs \((a, b)\) where both are integer multiples of 2, i.e., both even integers; this ensures the forms like \(a^2 + 4b\) and \(b^2 + 4a\) are perfect squares under the given constraints. This guess aligns with typical solutions where quadratic relations are satisfied by pairs scaled by 2.

Thus, the clean, parametric description is: all pairs \((a, b)\) such that both are even:

The current proposed answer is a natural conjecture based on the symmetry and structure of the conditions, especially considering quadratic forms that are perfect squares often relate to parametric solutions involving multiples of 2. To formalize this, note that the conditions \(a^2 + 4b = m^2\) and \(b^2 + 4a = n^2\) suggest that \(a\) and \(b\) satisfy specific quadratic and divisibility constraints, which are compatible with the pairs where both \(a\) and \(b\) are even.

The error in the initial Lean code arises because the set notation was not properly constructed with a predicate or set comprehension syntax. The corrected form uses a lambda predicate structure inside `{ | ... }` in Lean syntax, equipped with the existential quantifiers for parameters \(k, l\). 

Concluding, the closed form set is the collection of all pairs \((a, b)\) where both are even, i.e., multiples of 2, expressed as pairs \((a, b) = (2k, 2l)\) with \(k, l \in ℤ\). This aligns with the parametric solutions consistent with the quadratic sum conditions.
