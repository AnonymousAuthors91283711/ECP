From the pattern, the minimal n must accommodate all 8 elements with pairwise covering sets of size 2 or 3, such that every pair is uniquely contained. Given the set size and covering constraints, the minimal n is 4, as the constructions typically require at least 4 sets to cover all pairs with such size constraints in this context.
