Ground Truth Answer: (62, 2)
Proposed Answer: (30, 35)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find a unique pair of natural numbers (p₁, p₂) where:
   - Both p₁ and p₂ are positive
   - They satisfy the equation: (p₁ + p₂ - 1)(p₁ + p₂)/2 - p₁ + 1 = 2015

2. For the ground truth answer (62, 2):
   - Sum = 64
   - Calculation: (63*64)/2 - 62 + 1 = 2016 - 62 + 1 = 1955 ≠ 2015

3. For the proposed answer (30, 35):
   - Sum = 65
   - Calculation: (64*65)/2 - 30 + 1 = 2080 - 30 + 1 = 2051 ≠ 2015

Interestingly, neither answer seems to satisfy the equation. However, the problem states there exists a unique solution, so both answers must be incorrect. 

Since neither answer satisfies the given equation, they are equally wrong, but they are not equivalent to each other.
