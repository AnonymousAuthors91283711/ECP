Given the product condition (∏ i in s, (1 - 1 / i)) = 51/2010 and all i > 0, the set s must contain elements whose reciprocal adjustments multiply to 51/2010. Factoring 51/2010, and considering the form (1 - 1/i), the set likely involves small integers, specifically factors which lead to such a ratio. The minimal such n corresponds to including elements from the factors involved in 51 and 2010. The minimal n satisfying the conditions is 13, since s consists of integers {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}.

Thus, the answer is:

<<<13>>>
