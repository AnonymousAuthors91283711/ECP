: {(a, b) : ℕ × ℕ | a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ (GCDMonoid.gcd a b = (∏ i ∈ Finset.Icc 1 50, i) ∧ GCDMonoid.lcm a b = (∏ i ∈ Finset.Icc 1 50, i ^ 2))}.encard = omnimath3650_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The GCD of a and b is the product of numbers 1 to 50, and the LCM is the square of this product. It implies a and b are both this product, since gcd and lcm are equal only if a = b. So, the answer is 1.
