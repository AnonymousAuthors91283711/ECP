The sequence definition suggests a pattern formed by absolute differences of previous terms, with initial terms being large powers. Based on similar difference sequences, a likely closed form at n=14^14 involves powers and their shifts. Examining enumerated answers (if provided), the pattern indicates the answer is a power expression consistent with the initial values.

Thus, a plausible closed form is (a (14 ^ 14)) = 12 ^ 12, matching the pattern of the earlier terms' powers.
