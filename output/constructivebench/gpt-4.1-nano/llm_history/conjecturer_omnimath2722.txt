abbrev omnimath2722_answer : ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath2722 :
  ∃ (a b c : ℤ), a ≠ b ∧ b ≠ c ∧ a ≠ c ∧
  a * b * c = 17955 ∧
  b - a = c - b ∧
  ∃ (r : ℤ), (3 * b + c) = r * (3 * a + b) ∧ (3 * c + a) = r * (3 * b + c) ∧
  a + b + c = omnimath2722_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℤ
<<<0>>>
The pattern suggests the sum is 0 for the symmetric, difference-based solutions with specified polynomial equations.
