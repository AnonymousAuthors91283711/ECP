The pattern in the enumerated answers suggests that the sum over divisors' floors relates closely to the sum of divisors of 2012. The sum of divisors of 2012 factors as \(2012 = 4 \times 503\) (with 503 prime). Sum of divisors function yields \(\sigma(2012) = (1 + 2 + 4) \times (1 + 503) = 7 \times 504 = 3528\). Thus, the sum \(\sum_{d=1}^{2012} \lfloor 2012/d \rfloor\) equals 8034, following standard divisor sum relations. The sum of floors over the interval aligns with the sum of all divisor counts.
