Given the pattern of the product and factorial, the divisibility condition suggests n is large enough so that the product contains enough factors of 2 to cover factorial n. For all n ≥ 2, the product contains (2i - 1) and 2i, providing sufficient 2's to divide n!. The minimal such n satisfying all conditions is 2005. 

Thus, the answer is 2005.
