Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 7 * x + 4
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℤ => if Int.bodd x then 0 else 2 * x + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function f(x) where if (3x+1) is even, then f(x) must be odd.

2. Ground truth answer: f(x) = 7x + 4
- For any integer x, 7x + 4 is always odd (7x is same parity as x, plus 4 makes it opposite parity)
- When 3x+1 is even, x must be odd (since 3*odd+1=even, 3*even+1=odd)
- So the ground truth satisfies the condition

3. Proposed answer: f(x) = if x is odd then 0 else 2x + 1
- When x is odd (which is when 3x+1 is even), it returns 0 (which is even) - this violates the condition
- When x is even, it returns an odd number (2x+1), but this case doesn't matter since the condition only cares about when 3x+1 is even (x odd)

The proposed answer fails exactly when it needs to work (when x is odd), returning an even number when it should return odd.
