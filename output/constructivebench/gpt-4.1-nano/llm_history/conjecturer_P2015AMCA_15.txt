The problem asks for the minimal n ≥ 0 such that there exists some k with 123456789 * 10^n = k * (2^26 * 5^4), with k coprime to 10. Since 123456789 factors into prime powers, and given 10^n = 2^n * 5^n, we need n to compensate the powers of 2 and 5 in the numerator, and k must be coprime to 10, so no shared prime factors. The minimal n cancels all prime factors in numerator aside from those in 10^n, resulting in n = 4.

The current proposed answer `fun n : ℕ => 4` defines a function from ℕ to some type, which is incompatible with the abbreviated name `P2015AMCA_15_answer` being an ℕ. Since the theorem states `IsLeast {n : ℕ | ...} P2015AMCA_15_answer`, the answer should be a single natural number (a specific, minimal `n` satisfying the property). Therefore, rather than a function, the answer should be an explicit natural number.

Considering the structure of the problem, the key is to identify the minimal `n` such that `∃ (k : ℕ), 123456789 * 10^n = k * (2^26 * 5^4)` and `coprime k 10`. The minimal n would correspond to the smallest power of 10 that divides `k`'s factorization appropriately, considering the prime factorization of the constants involved.

Since `10^n = 2^n * 5^n`, and the right side involves `2^26 * 5^4`, the divisor powers suggest the minimal `n` should be the maximum of the powers needed to clear out the factors in `k * (2^26 * 5^4)` to match `123456789 * 10^n`.

The factor `123456789` can be analyzed for its prime factors:
`123456789 = 3^2 * 3607 * 3803` (which involves primes other than 2 and 5). Thus, to make `k` coprime with 10, `k` should contain the factors `3^2 * 3607 * 3803`, which are coprime with 10, so `k` itself doesn't include factors of 2 or 5.

To match the powers of 2 and 5 in the expression:
- The right side's factors: `2^26 * 5^4`.
- The left is: `123456789 * 10^n = 123456789 * 2^n * 5^n`.

We want `k` a number coprime with 10, so `k` should be free of 2s and 5s factors. Then, for the equality to hold:
`123456789 * 2^n * 5^n = k * 2^26 * 5^4`.

Dividing both sides by `k`:
`123456789 * 2^n * 5^n / k = 2^26 * 5^4`, with `k` coprime to 10.

Given the prime factors, to have the factors of 2 and 5 on the left match those of the right, `n` should satisfy:
- `n ≥ 26` (since top power of 2 must match or exceed that in right side)
- `n ≥ 4` (for the power of 5)

Therefore, the minimal `n` satisfying both is `n = 26`.

Hence, the answer is just `26`.

**Final fixed answer:**
<<<26>>>

This aligns with the minimal `n` where the factors line up appropriately, and the theorem's statement corresponds to picking this `n`.
