Given the problem involves a large modulus and an answer discovered via enumeration, the pattern suggests the answer is the remainder when dividing the large number by the modulus. The pattern indicates extracting a specific factorization or pattern.

Since the enumerated answer is omitted, but the context suggests an invariant, a plausible closed form based on pattern recognition from similar problems is:

<<<10002000400080016003200640128025605121024204840968192 % 100020004000800160032>>>>>
