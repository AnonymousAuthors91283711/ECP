The pattern indicates functions satisfying a recursive-like property related to polynomial degrees, especially involving expressions with powers and sums. Since P f characterizes functions with finite pre-image sizes and a specific functional equation resembling polynomial behavior, likely solutions are polynomial functions of bounded degree. The simplest such family are constant or linear functions fitting these constraints.

Thus, the closed form describes functions of degree ≤ 3, with zero sets of finite size n.

The main goal is to define a set containing functions matching the described properties: functions with finite zero sets of size n and satisfying the functional equation \(f(x^4 + y) = x^3 \cdot f x + f (f y)\). The structure suggests there are only polynomial solutions, especially constant or linear functions, consistent with the functional form and finite zero sets.

Given that the zero set sizes are finite (from zero to arbitrary \(n\)), and considering the polynomial nature suggested by the recursive relation, the functions are likely constants or affine linear functions. The functional equation's structure (involving powers 4, 3, and nested \(f\)) indicates these solutions have degrees ≤ 3.

Hence, the set of solutions in closed form includes all constant functions and affine linear functions, which are sufficient to satisfy the zero set condition and potentially the functional equation (with proper constants).

Based on the problem structure and the functional equation \(f(x^4 + y) = x^3 \cdot f x + f (f y)\), the functions satisfying these conditions are likely either constant functions or affine linear functions. Constant functions trivially have finite zero sets (empty or a singleton set) and could satisfy a simplified form of the functional equation. Affine linear functions \(f(x) = a x + b\) also can satisfy the equation with suitable constants, and their zero sets are finite (either empty or a singleton). Higher-degree polynomial solutions are unlikely consistent with the zero set finiteness condition and the recursive structure of the relation.

Hence, the set of functions should be all constant functions and all affine linear functions. The correct Lean expression should be a union of these two sets:

- Constant functions: \(\{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a : ℝ, ∀ x, f x = a \}\).

- Affine linear functions: \(\{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a b : ℝ, ∀ x, f x = a * x + b\}\).

The erroneous text was just an extended comment within the `abbrev` declaration, which led to syntax errors. To fix this, I will enclose the set of functions in braces for set notation, and ensure the syntax matches Lean expectations, avoiding non-identifier tokens and comments in the declaration.
