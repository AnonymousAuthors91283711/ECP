Given the equations a + b = s and a - b = 60, with a, b ∈ ℕ, then a = (s + 60)/2, b = (s - 60)/2, both are integers when s ≡ 60 mod 2 and s ≥ 60. Since a and b are non-negative, s ≥ 60. To maximize s with the property that √a + √b = √k holds for some k not a perfect square, the largest s occurs when a and b equal the maximum perfect square roots satisfying the conditions. The pattern suggests s=120, the maximal sum where sqrt a + sqrt b = sqrt k with non-square k.

<<<120>>>
