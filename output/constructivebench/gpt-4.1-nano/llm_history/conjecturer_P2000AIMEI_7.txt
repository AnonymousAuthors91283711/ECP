Given the symmetry and the structure of the equations, typical rational solutions suggest that the ratios z + 1/y and x + 1/z are rational numbers with coprimality constraints. The pattern indicates the answer involves ratios related to the denominators in these sums, which are coprime and positive. The enumerated answer hints at a simple pair involving positive coprime integers, likely derived from the consecutive fractions in the steps.

Answer: <<<(1, 29)>>>

This choice matches the pattern of fractions derived from the sums, with coprimality, positivity, and symmetry considerations.
