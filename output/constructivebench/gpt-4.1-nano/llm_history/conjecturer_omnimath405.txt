abbrev omnimath405_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath405 :
  let x := 2001 ^ 1002 - 2001 ^ (-1002 : ℤ)
  let y := 2001 ^ 1002 + 2001 ^ (-1002 : ℤ)
  x ^ 2 - y ^ 2 = omnimath405_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Since \(x = 2001^{1002} - 2001^{-1002}\) and \(y = 2001^{1002} + 2001^{-1002}\), using the difference of squares, \(x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y)\). Simplifying gives \(x^2 - y^2 = -4\). Therefore,

<<<-4>>>

which matches the pattern and the algebraic simplification.
