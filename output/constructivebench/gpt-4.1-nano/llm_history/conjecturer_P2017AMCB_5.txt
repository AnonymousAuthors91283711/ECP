Given the typical box plot outlier detection method, data points outside 1.5 * IQR from Q1 or Q3 are considered outliers. Calculating lowerBound and upperBound, the outliers are those less than 6 or greater than 51, which are 6, 57 and 51. Only 6 and 57 are outside bounds; 51 is exactly on the upper bound, so not an outlier. Therefore, total outliers are 1, 57, with no 6. But in the data, 6 and 57 are outside, total 2 outliers.
