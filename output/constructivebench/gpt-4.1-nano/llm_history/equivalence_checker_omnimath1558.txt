Ground Truth Answer: 37/4
Proposed Answer: 19
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes two sequences:
   - An arithmetic sequence aₙ = a₁ + (n-1)*d
   - A geometric sequence bₙ = b₁ * r^(n-1)

2. We're given constraints on the products of corresponding terms:
   - a₁*b₁ = 20
   - (a₁+d)*(b₁*r) = 19
   - (a₁+2d)*(b₁*r²) = 14
   - We need to find the maximum possible value of (a₁+3d)*(b₁*r³)

3. The ground truth answer is 37/4 (which is 9.25)
4. The proposed answer is 19

The proposed answer (19) is significantly larger than the ground truth answer (9.25). There's no way these could be equivalent since 19 ≠ 9.25. The proposed answer is incorrect.
