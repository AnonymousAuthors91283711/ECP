Ground Truth Answer: 2069
Proposed Answer: 2708
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n > 2023 where the sum of its digits equals 17.

2. Ground Truth Answer (2069):
- 2069 > 2023
- Sum of digits: 2 + 0 + 6 + 9 = 17
- It's indeed the smallest such number after 2023

3. Proposed Answer (2708):
- 2708 > 2023
- Sum of digits: 2 + 7 + 0 + 8 = 17
- However, 2708 is larger than 2069, so it's not the least number satisfying the condition

The proposed answer satisfies the digit sum condition but fails to be the smallest such number greater than 2023. Therefore, it's incorrect as the solution to this problem.
