theorem P2004AMCB_15 :
  ∃ (j b : ℕ),
    j < 100 ∧ b < 100 ∧
    j / 10 = b % 10 ∧ j % 10 = b / 10 ∧
    j + 5 = 2 * (b + 5) ∧
    |(j - b : ℤ)| = P2004AMCB_15_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the answer relates to a specific numeric difference derived from the constraints, particularly involving a symmetric transformation when swapping digits. Based on the enumeration pattern, the final answer simplifies to 10, representing the minimum non-zero difference satisfying all constraints.
