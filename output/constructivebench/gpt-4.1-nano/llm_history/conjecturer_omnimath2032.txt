  {(a, b, c, d) : ℤ × ℤ × ℤ × ℤ | |a| ≤ 5 ∧ |b| ≤ 5 ∧ |c| ≤ 5 ∧ |d| ≤ 5 ∧ (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2)^2 = (a + b + c + d) * (a - b + c - d) * ((a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2)}.ncard = omnimath2032_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The expression simplifies to counting quadruples within bounds satisfying a quadratic relation, which simplifies to the total combinations since the relation holds only when all variables are zero, given the bounds are small. Hence, the only solution is when (a, b, c, d) = (0, 0, 0, 0). 

Therefore, answer is 1.
