abbrev omnimath2667_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2667 (x : ℝ) : 
  (2 + x + 10) / 3 = x ↔ x = omnimath2667_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The given equation simplifies to (12 + x)/3 = x, which leads to 12 + x = 3x, so 12 = 2x, thus x = 6. 

Final answer in Lean:
<<<6>>>
