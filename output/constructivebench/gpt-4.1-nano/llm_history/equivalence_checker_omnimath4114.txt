Ground Truth Answer: 4044
Proposed Answer: (10^2022 - 1) * 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves a number L which is a repunit (number consisting of 2022 '1's in base 10), since L = (10^2022 - 1)/9.

2. The expression 9*L^2 + 2*L evaluates to a number with interesting digit properties. For smaller cases:
   - When L=1 (2022=1): 9*1 + 2*1 = 11 → digit sum is 2
   - When L=11 (2022=2): 9*121 + 2*11 = 1089 + 22 = 1111 → digit sum is 4
   - The pattern suggests the digit sum is 2*2022 = 4044

3. The ground truth answer (4044) matches this pattern exactly.

4. The proposed answer is (10^2022 - 1)*2, which evaluates numerically to a number with 2022 '9's followed by a '8' (since 2*(10^n-1) = 2*99...9 = 199...98). The digit sum would be 2022*9 + 8 = 18206, which is completely different from 4044.
