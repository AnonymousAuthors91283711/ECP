The sequence defined by F follows the Fibonacci pattern with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, and F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2), which is the Fibonacci sequence starting with 1, 1. To find the sum from 1 to 10, sum of first 10 Fibonacci numbers starting from F(1). The sum of first n Fibonacci numbers is F(n+2)-1. Therefore, sum from 1 to 10 is F(12)-1. With F(12)=144, the sum is 143.
