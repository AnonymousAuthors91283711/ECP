Ground Truth Answer: 421
Proposed Answer: (2 * 4 ^ 14) - 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a transformation T that takes a set of integer coordinate points and expands it by including all adjacent points (up, down, left, right). It's asking for the cardinality of applying this transformation 14 times starting from {(0,0)}.

2. The ground truth answer is 421, which is a specific number.

3. The proposed answer is (2 * 4^14) - 1, which evaluates to 2 * 268,435,456 - 1 = 536,870,911, which is much larger than 421.

4. The proposed answer seems to be an overestimation, likely counting all possible paths without considering overlaps or the diamond-shaped boundary that forms when repeatedly applying T.

5. The correct answer should grow quadratically (as a diamond shape) rather than exponentially.
