The key to the problem is the relation \( 10x^3 + 20y^3 + 2006xyz = 2007z^3 \). Testing parity and symmetry suggests solutions where \( x = y \). Simplifying yields a relation suggesting specific proportional solutions for \( x, y, z \). Considering integer solutions, the maximum value of \( x + y + z \) appears when \( x = y = 0 \), \( z \) maximized. The pattern indicates the maximum sum approaches \( 2007 \), corresponding to when \( z = 1 \) and \( x = y = 0 \). 

**Final answer:**
<<<2007>>>
