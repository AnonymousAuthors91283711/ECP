Ground Truth Answer: (-7) / 16
Proposed Answer: (4 : ℂ)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the sum of squares of all distinct roots of a given 10th degree polynomial.

2. The ground truth answer is (-7)/16, which is a rational number expressed as a complex number.

3. The proposed answer is simply 4 (as a complex number).

4. To verify, let's consider Vieta's formulas and symmetric sums:
   - For a polynomial ∑aₙXⁿ, the sum of roots is -aₙ₋₁/aₙ
   - Here, sum of roots would be -(-7)/4 = 7/4
   - Sum of squares of roots = (sum of roots)² - 2*(sum of product of roots two at a time)
   - The second term would involve the coefficient of X⁸, which is 5/4
   - This calculation would indeed lead to a fraction, not an integer

5. The proposed answer (4) is clearly different from the ground truth (-7/16), and doesn't match what we'd expect from the polynomial's coefficients.
