noncomputable abbrev omnimath2819_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2819 (a b x : ℝ) (h : a + b = 12) :
  a * (x + 2) + b * (x + 2) = 60 ↔ x = omnimath2819_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the given equation a*(x+2)+b*(x+2)=60 and the condition a+b=12, factor out (x+2) to get (a+b)*(x+2)=60. Since a+b=12, then 12*(x+2)=60, so (x+2)=60/12=5. Therefore, x=3. The answer simplifies to x=3 regardless of a and b, consistent with the pattern in enumerated answers.

Therefore, the final answer is:

<<<3>>>
