Given the pattern and constraints, the three primes \( p, q, r \) are the unique ordered factors. The product \( p * q * r = 989 * 1001 * 1007 + 320 \) suggests specific primes close to the prime factors of components (989, 1001, 1007) plus the added 320. Factoring this, the likely primes are 89, 97, and 103, which are primes near the factors. Based on the ordering \( p < q < r \), the answer in Lean form becomes:

<<<(89, 97, 103)>>>
