theorem olympiadbench3077 :
  (floor (100000 * (1.002 : ℝ) ^ 10) = olympiadbench3077_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Since \(\lfloor 100000 \times 1.002^{10} \rfloor\) can be approximated as \(100000 \times 1.002^{10}\), and recognizing \(1.002^{10} \approx e^{10 \times \ln 1.002} \approx e^{10 \times 0.001998} \approx e^{0.01998} \approx 1.0202\), the product is approximately \(100000 \times 1.0202 = 102020\). The floor doesn't alter this approximate integer, so the answer is close to 102020. Thus, the exact closed-form in Lean:

<<<102020>>>
