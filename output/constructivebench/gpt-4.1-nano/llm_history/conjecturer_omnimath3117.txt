The set of (x + y)/x with x in [-4, -2], y in [2, 4] spans from when x = -4, y=2 (giving -0.5) to x = -2, y=4 (giving 3). The expression simplifies to 1 + y/x, with y/x in [-2, -1/2], so sum in [0.5, 1.5], but since y/x ∈ [2/(-4), 4/(-2)] = [-0.5, -2], the range of z is from (x + y)/x = 1 + y/x in [-1, -0.5].

Final answer: <<< -1 >>>
