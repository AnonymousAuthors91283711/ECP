noncomputable abbrev omnimath1717_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1717 :
  ∃ (z1 z2 : ℂ), z1 ≠ z2 ∧ z1 ^ 2 + 2 * z1 = I ∧ z2 ^ 2 + 2 * z2 = I ∧ 
  re z1 * re z2 = omnimath1717_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests that the real parts of the solutions relate to the roots of the quadratic obtained from the equations. Solving z^2 + 2z - i = 0 yields real parts involving 1 and -1. Since the product of real parts appears and the solutions are pairs, the consistent real parts sum to zero, leading to the answer as zero.
