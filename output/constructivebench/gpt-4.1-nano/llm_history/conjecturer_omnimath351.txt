The key to solving this problem involves recognizing identities related to sine and cosine, and the structure of the set. The given equation resembles the sine addition formula, and the second condition resembles the sine difference formula. The maximum value of z meets when the sum equals 1 in conjunction with these identities, which suggests the maximum occurs at specific angles. Based on the pattern and identities, the supremum of z is 1.
