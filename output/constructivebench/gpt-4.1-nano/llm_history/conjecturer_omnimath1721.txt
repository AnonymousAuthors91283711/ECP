The pattern indicates that numbers not formed by the given conditions are precisely those that are neither sums of consecutive integers nor prime powers nor p+1, nor products of two distinct primes. These are the composite numbers with no small special structure, avoiding the "forms". The simplest such non-form number is 1, as it doesn't meet the forms' conditions. Since the question asks for the minimal n > 0 that cannot be formed, the answer is 1.
