Based on the pattern in the enumerated answers, the answer appears to be related to the number of triplets (f, g, h) in the symmetric group on 5 elements satisfying specific commuting-like conditions, which resemble the properties of certain idempotent or projection-like elements. The counting pattern fits with the number of such structured triplets, which simplifies to 25.

<<<25>>>
