Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: 260360
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest number ≥100000 that is divisible by 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.

2. First, we find the LCM of these numbers:
   - LCM(10,11,12,13,14,15) = LCM(10,12,15) × LCM(11,13,14) = 60 × 2002 = 120120

3. The ground truth answer (2) suggests the solution is 100000 + 2*120120 = 340240, but this is incorrect as 100000 + 120120 = 220120 is already >100000.

4. The proposed answer (260360) suggests 100000 + 260360*10 = 2703600, which is way too large.

5. The correct approach would be to find the smallest multiple of 120120 ≥100000, which is 120120 itself (since 120120 > 100000).

6. The correct answer should be (120120 - 100000)/10 = 2012, but neither answer matches this.
