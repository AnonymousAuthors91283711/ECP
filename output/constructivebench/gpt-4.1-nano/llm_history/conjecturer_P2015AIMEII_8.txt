Given the inequality constraints and the nature of the expression, the expression reaches its maximum when \(a' = 1\) and \(b'\) is large, approaching infinity, because the dominant term is \(a'^3 b'^3 / (a'^3 + b'^3)\), which approaches \(b'^3\) as \(a'\) is minimal. The maximum occurs when \(a' = 1\) and \(b'\) tends to infinity; the value approaches \(b'^3 / (b'^3) \to 1\).

Therefore, the supremum of the set tends to 1, but is never exceeded or reached exactly, so the greatest element is approaching 1, and no finite element reaches it. Hence, the greatest element should be 1.

In Lean expression:
