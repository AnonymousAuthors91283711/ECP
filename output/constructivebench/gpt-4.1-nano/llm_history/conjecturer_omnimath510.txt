Let's examine the sets:
alice = {1,2,3,4}, bob = {1,2,3,4,5}, charlie = {1,2,3,4,5,6}.

The sum involves x in (alice ∩ bob) ∪ (alice ∩ charlie) ∪ (bob ∩ charlie).

Interest points:
- x in all three: contributes for x ∈ {1,2,3,4}
- x in alice and charlie only (excluding bob): x ∈ {1,2,3,4}
- x in bob and charlie only (excluding alice): x ∈ {1,2,3,4,5}

Calculations yield total expected value as a constant involving fractions and set intersections.

The pattern suggests the sum simplifies to a direct rational expression based on the probabilities:  
Answer: 1/4 + 1/5 + 3/20

Proposed Expression in Lean:
<<<(1/4) + (1/5) + (3/20)>>>
