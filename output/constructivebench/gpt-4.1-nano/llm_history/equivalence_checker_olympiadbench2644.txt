Ground Truth Answer: 45/2
Proposed Answer: 22
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves summing the squares of sine functions at specific angles (multiples of 4° from 4° to 176°).

2. The ground truth answer is 45/2 = 22.5

3. The proposed answer is 22

The proposed answer is very close to the ground truth answer (only 0.5 difference), but it's not exactly correct. The difference suggests the proposed answer might be missing a final term or made a rounding error.

Since the answers are numerically close but not mathematically equivalent, the correct judgment is:

<<<False>>>
