The function f(x) = sin^6 x + cos^6 x - 0.7(sin^4 x + cos^4 x) is symmetric in sin and cos, and simplifies to a polynomial in sin^2 x. Using symmetry and periodicity, key points include where sin^2 x = cos^2 x (i.e., x = π/4 + kπ). Values at these points lead to zeros. Based on given enumerations, the solutions are at x where sin^2 x = cos^2 x, i.e., x ≡ π/4 + kπ. Hence, the set of solutions is {x | x = π/4 + kπ, k ∈ ℤ}. 

Final answer in Lean:

<<<{x : ℝ | ∃ k : ℤ, x = π/4 + k * π}>>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The primary error stems from the use of "π" without defining it. In Lean, "π" isn't predefined; instead, the constant π is typically available as `Real.pi`. To fix the errors and make the code compile, I will replace `π` with `Real.pi`. 

Based on the problem's structure and the typical solutions involving trigonometric equations, the set of solutions to:

f(x) = sin^6(x) + cos^6(x) - 0.7(sin^4(x) + cos^4(x)) = 0

are likely points where sine and cosine satisfy certain algebraic relations, which are well-known at x = π/4 + kπ, since at these points, sin and cos are equal or differ by π, leading to solutions of the given polynomial in sin and cos.

Thus, the final answer set in a closed form is:

{ x | x = π/4 + k π, for k ∈ ℤ }

In Lean, this becomes:

```lean
{ x : ℝ | ∃ k : ℤ, x = Real.pi / 4 + k * Real.pi }
```

**Final Answer in Lean:**

<<<{ x : ℝ | ∃ k : ℤ, x = Real.pi / 4 + k * Real.pi }>>>
