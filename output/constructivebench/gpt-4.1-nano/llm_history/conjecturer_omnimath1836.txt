The pattern suggests the minimal k > 0 where 49 (7^2) divides the central binomial coefficient. Given 49 divides C(2k,k), and for divisibility by p^2, p must be prime, and we analyze the divisibility conditions for binomial coefficients. The smallest such k is when k=7, since C(14,7) is divisible by 49, and smaller k values are not.
