The common value of k ensuring two distinct real roots of the quadratic equations is when the discriminant is positive: 36 - 4k^2 > 0, leading to |k| < 3. Since k ≠ 0, the set of all such k is all nonzero reals with |k| < 3, which in ℤ reduces to -2 or 2.

The key issue is that the proposed answer is written as a descriptive sentence rather than a proper Lean expression. The set of integers `k` such that the quadratic equations have two distinct real roots must be explicitly described in Lean as a set. Since for the quadratic equations to have real and distinct roots, the discriminant (36 - 4k^2) must be positive: 36 - 4k^2 > 0, or equivalently, |k| < 3.

In the integers, this inequality gives k ∈ {-2, -1, 1, 2}. However, the problem's explanation suggests focusing on non-zero k with |k| < 3, which reduces to the set {-2, -1, 1, 2}. However, checking discriminant: for |k|=1, discriminant = 36 - 4= 32 > 0; for |k|=2, discriminant=36 - 16= 20 > 0; for |k|=3, discriminant=36 -36=0, so root is repeated, not distinct; for |k|=0, discriminant=36.

The problem asks for k with two distinct roots, so exclude k=0 and k=±3, and include all other integers with |k|<3, i.e., -2, -1, 1, 2.

**Final corrected answer in Lean:**

<<<{k : ℤ | k ≠ 0 ∧ abs k < 3}>>>

**Explanations:**
- Use set notation to represent the set of integers satisfying the inequalities.
- The set of all integer k with k ≠ 0 and |k|<3 is exactly {-2, -1, 1, 2}.
- The set is written as `{k : ℤ | k ≠ 0 ∧ abs k < 3}`, which correctly captures this in Lean syntax.
- The previous description inefficiently mixed reasoning with language; the goal is a set expression that matches the problem logic.
