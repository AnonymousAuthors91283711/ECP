  IsLeast {x : ℕ | 0 < x ∧ ∃ y : ℕ, 0 < y ∧ 7 * x^5 = 11 * y^13} P2003AMCB_18_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the equation 7 * x^5 = 11 * y^13, and considering prime factorizations and divisibility constraints, the only positive integer solution is x = 0, but since 0< x, no solutions exist, implying the minimal x is 0. Hence, the answer is 0.
