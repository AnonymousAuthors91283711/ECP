theorem omnimath2984 : 
  ∃! b, (0 = 2 * (-4) + b) ↔ b = omnimath2984_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the equivalence 0 = 2 * (-4) + b, solve for b: 0 = -8 + b, hence b = 8. The uniqueness is trivial since b is explicitly computed. Final answer is a constant real number, 8. 

<<<8>>>
