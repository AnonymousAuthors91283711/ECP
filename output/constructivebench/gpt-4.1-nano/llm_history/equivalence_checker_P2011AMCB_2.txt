Ground Truth Answer: 90
Proposed Answer: 93
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number x such that when added to the given scores (90,80,70,60,85), the new average of 6 scores is at least 3 points higher than the original average of 5 scores.

2. First, calculate the original average of 5 scores:
   (90 + 80 + 70 + 60 + 85)/5 = 385/5 = 77

3. The new average requirement is: new average ≥ 77 + 3 = 80

4. So we need to solve for the smallest x where:
   (385 + x)/6 ≥ 80
   385 + x ≥ 480
   x ≥ 95

5. The ground truth answer is 90, which is incorrect based on this calculation (90 would give average 79.17 < 80).

6. The proposed answer is 93, which is also incorrect (93 would give average 79.67 < 80).

However, both answers are incorrect based on the mathematical calculation. The correct answer should be 95.
