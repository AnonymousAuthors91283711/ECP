Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 1, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1, 2)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all triples (x, y, z) of positive integers satisfying 3^x - 5^y = z^2.

2. Ground Truth Answer {(2, 1, 2)}:
   - 3^2 - 5^1 = 9 - 5 = 4 = 2^2 → Valid solution

3. Proposed Answer {(1, 1, 2)}:
   - 3^1 - 5^1 = 3 - 5 = -2 → Can't equal z^2 since squares are non-negative
   - This is clearly incorrect

The proposed answer is completely wrong as it doesn't satisfy the equation, while the ground truth answer is correct.

<<<False>>>
