The pattern suggests the problem compares floors divided by different constants, likely resulting in piecewise regions. The ratios involve powers of 2, with denominators 2.5 and 6.25 (which is 2.5^2), hinting at quadratic relations. It appears the answer scales proportionally to the square of the ratio \( \frac{2.5}{6.25} \), equating to \( \frac{1}{2.5} \). The volume proportion implies a quadratic factor. Hence, the finite ratio likely simplifies to \( \frac{1}{(2.5)^2} = \frac{1}{6.25} \). Therefore, the answer is 160.
