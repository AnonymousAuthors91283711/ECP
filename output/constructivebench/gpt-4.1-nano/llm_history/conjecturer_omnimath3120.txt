abbrev omnimath3120_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3120
: Real.sqrt (13 + Real.sqrt (7 + Real.sqrt 4)) = omnimath3120_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the nested radical: √(13 + √(7 + √4)), and noting √4 = 2, the structure simplifies step-by-step. Solve inner radical first: √(7 + 2) = √9 = 3. Then outer radical: √(13 + 3) = √16 = 4. So, the simplified expression equals 4.
