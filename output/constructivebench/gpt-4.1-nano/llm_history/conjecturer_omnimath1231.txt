The zeros of P are distinct and related to roots of quadratic, with specific evaluation conditions.  
From the roots of quadratic X^2 + bX + c, the zeros are (-b ± √(b^2 - 4c)) / 2.  
Given the evaluations at 1 and 2 and their inequality, b and c determine the roots explicitly, leading to the root at 0 when c=0.  
This aligns with the roots of P indicating c = 0, simplifying evaluation at 0.  
Answer should be c, as the zero of the polynomial under the given conditions is at c = 0.
