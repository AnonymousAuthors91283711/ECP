Ground Truth Answer: 80
Proposed Answer: 0.2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about calculating the probability that a student has both eye colors equal (i.e., (eyes s).1 = (eyes s).2).

2. The given conditions provide probabilities for students having at least one eye of each color (0, 1, or 2).

3. The ground truth answer is 80, which when divided by 100 gives 0.8 (80% probability).

4. The proposed answer is 0.2 (20% probability).

These answers are clearly different (0.8 vs 0.2) and represent opposite interpretations of the problem. The proposed answer is incorrect.
