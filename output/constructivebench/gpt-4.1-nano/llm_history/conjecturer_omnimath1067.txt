Because the conditions imply that each row and column, starting from initial fixed entries, are divisibility chains with positive integers, and the entries are determined by divisibility relations with the top-left and bottom-right entries fixed at 1 and 2009 respectively, the total number of such matrices equals the number of divisors configurations respecting these chains. Given the known divisor counting, the total configurations relate to the number of divisors of 2009, which is 4 (since 2009 = 7^2 * 41, with divisors 1, 7, 41, 49, 287, 2009). The total configurations are thus based on prime factor exponents, leading to 2^2 = 4 configurations.
