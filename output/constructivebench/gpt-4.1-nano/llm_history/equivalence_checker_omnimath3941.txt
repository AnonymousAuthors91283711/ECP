abbrev omnimath3941_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3941 (a b : ℕ) (ha : 0 < a) (hb : 0 < b) :
  (a^2 + b) % (b^2 - a) = 0 ∧ (b^2 + a) % (a^2 - b) = 0 ↔ (a, b) ∈ omnimath3941_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}
Proposed Answer: { (a, b) | a = b } ∪ { (1, 1) }
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The ground truth answer lists specific pairs: (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)
2. The proposed answer suggests all pairs where a=b plus (1,1)

Comparing these:
- The proposed answer includes (1,1) which isn't in the ground truth
- The proposed answer includes all a=b pairs (like (4,4), (5,5), etc.) which aren't in the ground truth
- The proposed answer misses asymmetric pairs like (1,2) and (2,1) that are in the ground truth

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It includes many invalid pairs not in the ground truth
2. It misses valid pairs from the ground truth
3. The only correct overlap is (2,2) and (3,3)
