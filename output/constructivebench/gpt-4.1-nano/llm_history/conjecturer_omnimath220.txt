The pattern involves n ≥ 1 and the existence of m with m^2 = n^2 + 3^n. Since n ≥ 1 and n^2 + 3^n is always positive, consider that for n ≥ 1, the value n^2 + 3^n is a perfect square when m = ±(n + 3^{n/2}) for even n; for odd n, no such m exists. The perfect square form suggests n must be even for m to be integer, with m = ±(n + 3^{n/2}). The sum n^2 + 3^n is perfect square if n is even: n^2 + 3^n = (n + 3^{n/2})^2. 
Therefore, the set consists of all n ≥ 1 with n even, i.e., n ≥ 2, n even.
