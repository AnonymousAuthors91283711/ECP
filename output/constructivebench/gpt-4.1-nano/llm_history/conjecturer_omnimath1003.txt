    (P : ℝ × ℝ × ℝ → Prop)
    (hP : ∀ x y z : ℝ, P (x, y, z) ↔ x > 0 ∧ y > 0 ∧ z > 0 ∧ x * y + z = (x + z) * (y + z)) :
    IsGreatest {a | ∃ x y z : ℝ, P (x, y, z) ∧ a = x * y * z} omnimath1003_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The equation simplifies to revealing relationships among x, y, z, indicating they are all positive and satisfy certain product-sum relations. Observing the pattern in enumerations and the symmetry:
x * y + z = (x + z)(y + z). Expanding and simplifying leads to a relation involving a quadratic with z as a parameter. The maximum (a) occurs when x, y, z are positive and aligned such that the product x*y*z is maximized, which happens when x = y = z. 
By substituting x = y = z, the relation becomes x^2 + x = (2x)^2, giving x^2 + x = 4x^2 ⇒ -3x^2 + x = 0 ⇒ x(1 - 3x) = 0. Since x>0, we get x = 1/3. Then a = x^3 = (1/3)^3 = 1/27.
Final answer: <<< (1/3)^3 >>>
