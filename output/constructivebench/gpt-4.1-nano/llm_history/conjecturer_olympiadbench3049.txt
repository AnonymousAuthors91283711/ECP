theorem olympiadbench3049 :
  IsLeast {s : ℕ | ∃ (x y : ℕ), 20 * x + 80 * y = s ∧ (x + y > 0) ∧ s / (x + y) = 34} olympiadbench3049_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The minimal s that satisfies 20x + 80y = s, with x + y > 0 and s / (x + y) = 34, simplifies to s = 34(x + y). Substituting into the equation:

20x + 80y = 34(x + y) → 20x + 80y = 34x + 34y → (20 - 34)x + (80 - 34)y = 0 → -14x + 46y = 0 → 23y = 7x.

Since x, y ≥ 0 and x + y > 0, x must be divisible by 23, y must be divisible by 7, minimally x = 23, y = 7, giving:

s = 34(x + y) = 34(23 + 7) = 34 * 30 = 1020.

Final answer: <<<1020>>>
