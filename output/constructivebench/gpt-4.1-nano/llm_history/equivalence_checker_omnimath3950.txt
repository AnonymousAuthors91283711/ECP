Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 2 ^ n - 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 2^(n - 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest cardinality of a set S of natural numbers where:
   - For any m in S, if k^n divides m, then k^n must be 1 (meaning m is nth-power-free)
   - S is infinite
   - The extended cardinality of S is N

2. The ground truth answer is 2^n - 1
3. The proposed answer is 2^(n-1)

For n=2:
- Ground truth gives 2^2 - 1 = 3
- Proposed gives 2^(2-1) = 2

For n=3:
- Ground truth gives 2^3 - 1 = 7
- Proposed gives 2^(3-1) = 4

The answers clearly differ for all n ≥ 2. The proposed answer is consistently half of the ground truth answer when n=2, and the gap grows larger as n increases.
