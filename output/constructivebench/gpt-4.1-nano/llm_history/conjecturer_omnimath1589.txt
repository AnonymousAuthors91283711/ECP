    (P : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → Prop)
    (hP : P = fun α β γ => Real.cos α + Real.cos β + Real.cos γ = 1 ∧ Real.sin α + Real.sin β + Real.sin γ = 1) :
    IsLeast {x | ∃ β γ, P x β γ} omnimath1589_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The conditions sum the cosines and sines to 1, which suggests the angles form an equilateral triangle on the unit circle with sum of cosines and sines both 1. The only real number satisfying the sum of the components and the cos/sin constraints in such symmetric configuration leads to x equal to the squared length from origin to the centroid, which results in x = 1/3. 

Final answer:
<<<(1/3: ℝ)>>>
