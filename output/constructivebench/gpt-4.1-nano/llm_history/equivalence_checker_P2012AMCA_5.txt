Ground Truth Answer: 64
Proposed Answer: 32
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a system of equations:
   - b + r + g + c = 280
   - r = 2*b
   - g = 3*c
   - c = 4*r
   - c is the answer we're looking for

2. Let's solve the system step by step:
   - From c = 4*r and r = 2*b, we get c = 4*(2*b) = 8*b
   - From g = 3*c, we get g = 3*8*b = 24*b
   - Now substitute into the first equation: b + 2*b + 24*b + 8*b = 280
   - Combine terms: 35*b = 280 ⇒ b = 8
   - Therefore c = 8*b = 8*8 = 64

The ground truth answer is 64, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 32, which is incorrect (it's exactly half of the correct answer).
