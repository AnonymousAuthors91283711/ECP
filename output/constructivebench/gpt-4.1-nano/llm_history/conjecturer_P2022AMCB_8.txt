    p.2^4 + 1 = p.1^4 + 2 * p.2^2 ↔ p ∈ P2022AMCB_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ × ℝ)
The points satisfy the equation p₂^4 + 1 = p₁^4 + 2 p₂^2, which can be viewed as a quartic in p₁ for fixed p₂. Rearranging yields p₁^4 = p₂^4 - 2 p₂^2 + 1 = (p₂^2 - 1)^2, implying p₁ = ±(p₂^2 - 1). Therefore, the solution set describes two parabola branches with p₁ as ±(p₂^2 - 1). The set is all pairs (p₁, p₂) with p₁ = ±(p₂^2 - 1).
