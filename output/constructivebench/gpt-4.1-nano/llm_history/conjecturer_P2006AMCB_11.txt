abbrev P2006AMCB_11_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2006AMCB_11 :
  let joeInitial := (12 : ℚ)
  let joeDrink := (2 : ℚ)
  let joeAdd := (2 : ℚ)
  let joeFinalCream := joeAdd
  let joAnnInitial := (12 : ℚ)
  let joAnnAdd := (2 : ℚ)
  let joAnnDrink := (2 : ℚ)
  let joAnnFinalCream := joAnnAdd * (joAnnInitial / (joAnnInitial + joAnnAdd))
  joeFinalCream / joAnnFinalCream = P2006AMCB_11_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Given the setup, joeFinalCream is joeAdd = 2, and joAnnFinalCream is joAnnAdd * (12 / (12 + 2)) = 2 * (12/14) = 12/7. The ratio is (2) / (12/7) = 14/12 = 7/6. Therefore, answer = 7/6.<<<7/6>>>
