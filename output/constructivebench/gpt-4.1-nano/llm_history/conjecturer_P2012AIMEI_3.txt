The problem involves counting functions from Fin 9 to Fin 3 with specific constraints: exactly three 0s, three 1s, three 2s, and exactly one point where f i = i. Since the total elements are 9, with a fixed point, the remaining 8 are partitioned into three groups of 3 each (for 0,1,2). The key is choosing the fixed point and distributing the remaining 8 among the 3 groups, considering the positions of the fixed point.  
Number of such functions = 9 (fixed point choice) * (number of arrangements of remaining 8 items into 3 groups of 3, 3, 2, respectively).  
Total arrangements = 8! / (3! * 3! * 2!).  
Final answer: <<<9 * (8! / (3! * 3! * 2!))>>>
