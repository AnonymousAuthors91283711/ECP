theorem P2009AMCB_3 : 
  0.8 * 60 = (4/3) * P2009AMCB_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The equation states \(0.8 \times 60 = \frac{4}{3} \times P_{2009AMCB_3}\). Solving for \(P_{2009AMCB_3}\), we find \(P_{2009AMCB_3} = \frac{0.8 \times 60 \times 3}{4}\).

Calculating: \(0.8 \times 60 = 48\), then \(48 \times 3/4 = 48 \times \frac{3}{4} = 48 \times 0.75 =36\).

Thus, the expression simplifies to 36.

The current answer attempts to define `P2009AMCB_3_answer` as a function `(fun _ => 36)` which is a lambda expression taking some argument (say `x`) and returning `36`, i.e., a function type `(ℝ → ℝ)` rather than a direct real number. But the abbrev expects a value of type `ℝ`, not a function.

The error message indicates that Lean treats `fun _ => 36` as a function type rather than a real value, hence the type mismatch. 
Since the calculation in the theorem involves the expression `0.8 * 60 = (4/3) * P2009AMCB_3_answer`, and the right side is a real number, the answer must be a real constant, not a function.

Given the pattern of the formula, solving for `P2009AMCB_3_answer`, we get:
\[ P_{2009AMCB\_3} = \frac{0.8 \times 60}{4/3} \]
which simplifies to:
\[ P_{2009AMCB\_3} = \frac{48}{4/3} = 48 \times \frac{3}{4} = 36 \]

Thus, the corrected definition should directly assign the real number `36` to `P2009AMCB_3_answer`.

<<<36>>>

**Explanation:** The initial definition attempted to assign a function `(fun _ => 36)` to a variable declared as `abbrev P2009AMCB_3_answer : ℝ`, but `abbrev` requires an `ℝ` value, not a function. The direct number `36` (which is a real number) is the correct representation, fulfilling the type requirement and consistent with the algebraic derivation.
