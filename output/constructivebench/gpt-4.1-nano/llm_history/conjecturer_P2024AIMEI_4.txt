  p_win / p_prize = P2024AIMEI_4_answer.1 / P2024AIMEI_4_answer.2 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
The ratio simplifies to the probability of winning over the probability of getting a prize, which is the sum over k=2 to 4 of combinations with the total of 10, weighted by choosing k from 4 and (4-k) from 6 divided by total ways. The ratio simplifies to (1)/ (4 - 1) = 1/3. in numerator and denominator, this is 1 and 3 respectively.
