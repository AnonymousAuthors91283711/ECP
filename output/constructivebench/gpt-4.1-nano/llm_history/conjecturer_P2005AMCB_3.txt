abbrev P2005AMCB_3_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2005AMCB_3 : 
  ∀ (M : ℚ) (C : ℕ) (hM : M > 0) (hC : C > 0), 
  ∃ (p : ℚ) (hp : p > 0), 
  (M / 5 = p * (C / 3)) → 
  (M - p * C) / M = P2005AMCB_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The pattern suggests the expression simplifies to a constant ratio involving 15, since (M/5) = p * (C/3) implies p = (3/5)*(M/C). Substituting, the expression (M - p*C)/M simplifies to 1 - (p*C)/M = 1 - (3/5) = 2/5. 

Thus, the final answer is a constant \(\frac{2}{5}\).
