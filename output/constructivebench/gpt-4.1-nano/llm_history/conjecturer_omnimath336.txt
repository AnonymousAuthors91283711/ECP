  let 𝒮 := {S : Fin (n+1) × Fin (n+1) → Finset (Fin (2*n)) | 
    (∀ i j, (S (i, j)).card = i.1 + j.1) ∧

From the pattern, the answer counts the number of such nested, increasing sets. This resembles the number of ways to form upper-triangular matrices with set sizes increasing along the diagonal, which aligns with binomial coefficients. The total count matches the binomial coefficient for choosing `n` elements from `2n`.  
Thus, the closed-form answer is the central binomial coefficient:  
<<<fun n => Nat.choose (2 * n) n>>>
