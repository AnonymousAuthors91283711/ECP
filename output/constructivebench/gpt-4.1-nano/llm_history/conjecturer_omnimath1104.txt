Analyzing the recursive pattern of uparrow, the discrepancy modulo n occurs primarily when the base numbers relate to powers of a. The largest difference between uparrow a 6 and uparrow a 7, with a ≥ 2, tends to emerge when n equals powers of a, specifically at 64 (2^6). Therefore, the minimal n > 0 satisfying the condition is 64.
