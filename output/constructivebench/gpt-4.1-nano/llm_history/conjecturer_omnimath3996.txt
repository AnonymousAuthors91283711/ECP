Given the structure of the set \(\{b \mid a + b \mid a \times b\}\), the maximal \(m\) occurs when \(a=1983\), resulting in all \(b\) dividing \(a\). The maximum number of such divisors is \(d(1983)\). 1983 factors into 3 and 661, both prime, so \(d(1983)=4\). Therefore, the maximum \(m=a+b\) occurs at \(b=a=1983\), giving \(1983+1983=3966\).
