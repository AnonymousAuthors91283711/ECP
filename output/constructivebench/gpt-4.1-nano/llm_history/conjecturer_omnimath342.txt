The pattern suggests the minimal k such that the set's properties hold, likely related to factorization and the size (2016). 2016 factors as \(2^5 \times 3^2 \times 7\), with minimal such k related to small invariants. The minimal set size corresponds to the minimal number of partitions or classes. The least such k is 2, reflecting a bipartition capable of preventing the collapsing map under iteration within n ≤ 28.
