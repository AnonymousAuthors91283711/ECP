Based on pattern recognition, the equation's structure suggests the solutions involve small positive integers satisfying the prime condition and the quadratic relation. For an explicit set, the minimal solution appears to be when \(a=1\), \(b=1\), \(c=1\), and \(p=2\), satisfying the given equation. 

Final answer:

<<<{(1, 1, 1, 2)}>>>
