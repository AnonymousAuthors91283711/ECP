Ground Truth Answer: 75
Proposed Answer: 88
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find unique natural numbers AB.1 and AB.2 (both ≤9) such that:
   - (1001*AB.1 + 110*AB.2)² = 57108249
   - 10*AB.1 + AB.2 equals the answer

2. First, let's compute √57108249 = 7557 (since 7557² = 57108249)

3. So we have: 1001*AB.1 + 110*AB.2 = 7557

4. Let's test the ground truth answer 75:
   - AB.1 = 7, AB.2 = 5
   - 1001*7 + 110*5 = 7007 + 550 = 7557 ✔
   - 10*7 + 5 = 75 ✔

5. Now test proposed answer 88:
   - AB.1 = 8, AB.2 = 8
   - 1001*8 + 110*8 = 8008 + 880 = 8888 ≠ 7557 ✗
   - 10*8 + 8 = 88 ✔ (but first condition fails)

The proposed answer satisfies the second equation but fails the main condition, while the ground truth satisfies both.
