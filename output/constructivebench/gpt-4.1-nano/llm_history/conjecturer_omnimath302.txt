Given the problem constraints, the configuration resembles selecting 2n subsets T with overlapping at most single elements, each subset of size m, covering the set Sm where each element belongs to exactly 2 of T. The total number of elements in Sm should be minimized or maximized given the structure, leading to the conclusion:  
**maximal m = n**  
since each element is in exactly 2 sets, and there are 2n sets, this maximizes distinct elements needed, considering the overlaps.  
Final answer in Lean:  
<<<fun n : ℕ => n>>>
