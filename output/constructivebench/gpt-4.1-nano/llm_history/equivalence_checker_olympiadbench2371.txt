Ground Truth Answer: fun x => x ^ 2 - 2 * x + 2
Proposed Answer: fun y : ℝ => y^2 - y + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have f(x) = 2x + 1 (from hf)
2. We know g(f(x)) = 4x² + 1 (from hg)
3. We need to find g(y) where y = f(x) = 2x + 1

Let's solve for g using the ground truth:
g(y) = y² - 2y + 2
g(f(x)) = (2x+1)² - 2(2x+1) + 2 = 4x² + 4x + 1 - 4x - 2 + 2 = 4x² + 1 ✔️ matches hg

Now check the proposed answer:
g(y) = y² - y + 1
g(f(x)) = (2x+1)² - (2x+1) + 1 = 4x² + 4x + 1 - 2x - 1 + 1 = 4x² + 2x + 1 ≠ 4x² + 1 ✗ doesn't match hg

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the given condition g(f(x)) = 4x² + 1.
