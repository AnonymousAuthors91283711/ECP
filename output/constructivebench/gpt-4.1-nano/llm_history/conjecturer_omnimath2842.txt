The maximum value y occurs when choosing the largest values in S, and P is the cross product determinant: P a b c d. Since S = {1, 2, ..., 10}, and P a b c d computes the determinant of 2×2 matrices, the maximum determinant for distinct a, b, c, d is achieved with the largest numbers. The maximum determinant of four distinct numbers in order is obtained at (10,9,8,7), yielding 10*8 + 9*7 - 10*7 - 9*8 = 80 + 63 - 70 - 72 = 1. But for the maximum, we check all permutations, and the maximum magnitude of P is when the largest and smallest numbers are paired with the second largest and second smallest. The maximum value is 10*8 + 9*7 - 10*7 - 9*8 = 80 + 63 - 70 - 72 = 1. Alternatively, the pattern suggests the maximum is achieved at (10, 9, 8, 7) with value 1. 

Final answer: <<<10 * 8 + 9 * 7 - 10 * 7 - 9 * 8>>>
