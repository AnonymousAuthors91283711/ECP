The problem counts the difference in the number of binary-digit sums that are even versus odd when k ranges from 1 to 2^n, with n = 2017. Because the weight function sums binary digits, it follows that parity of weight is equally distributed among all k. Thus, the difference is always zero, regardless of n.
