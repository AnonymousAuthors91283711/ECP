The design suggests the ratio of new red marbles to total becomes \(\frac{2r}{b + 3r}\). Replacing \(b\) with \(3(b + r)/5\), the ratio simplifies to \(\frac{2r}{(3(b + r)/5) + 2r}\), which reduces to \(\frac{10r}{3(b + r)+10r}\) before substituting \(b + r\).

Since \(b + r > 0\), the ratio equals \(\frac{10r}{3(b + r)+10r}\). With \(b = 3(b + r)/5\), the ratio simplifies further to \( \frac{2r}{b + 3r} = \frac{2r}{(3(b + r)/5)+3r} = \frac{2r}{(3/5)(b + r)+3r} \), resulting in \(\frac{2r}{\frac{3}{5}(b+r)+3r}\).

Expressed in terms of \(b+r\), the ratio is:

\(\frac{2r}{\frac{3}{5}(b + r)+3r} \).

Using \(b = 3(b + r)/5\), then \(r = (b + r) - b\), which yields:

Final answer:

<<<(2 * r) / ((3 * (b + r) / 5) + 3 * r)>>>

which reduces to 

<<<(2 * (b + r - b)) / ((3 * (b + r) / 5) + 3 * (b + r - b))>>>

or

The main issue stems from trying to define P2012AMCA_4_answer as a constant involving `b` and `r` outside of its context, but within the scope of the `theorem`, `b` and `r` are local variables. In Lean, to refer to these local variables in a definition, we need to define a function of these variables, or make sure that the answer depends on them as parameters.

Given the structure, a suitable approach is to define the answer as a function of `b` and `r`. Since the question asks for a closed-form expression for the ratio `(newr / newtotal)` in terms of the initial `b` and `r`, and they are given with certain relations, the candidate answer should be expressed as a function of those variables.

From the enumerated answers and the pattern, the ratio `newr / newtotal = (2 * r) / (b + r + 2 * r) = (2 * r) / (b + 3 * r)`.

Using the variable `b` (which is redefined as from the initial b) and `r`, the closed form for this ratio simplifies to:

`(2 * r) / (b + 3 * r)`.

Thus, the fixed Lean code for the answer is:

```lean
<<<(2 * r) / (b + 3 * r)>>>
```

which is within the theorem scope and correctly references the local variables.

---

**Explanations**:
- We substitute the ratio as `(2 * r) / (b + 3 * r)` based on the problem's description and enumeration.
- Since `b` and `r` are local, the answer depends on them, expressed as a function of these variables.
- The original error arose because `r` and `b` were used outside their scope without being provided as parameters, so enclosing the answer as a local function ensures correctness.
- The closed form is consistent with the observed pattern, ratios involving initial variables scaled appropriately.

**Final answer in Lean**:
<<<(2 * r) / (b + 3 * r)>>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Analyzing the problem, the key elements are:

- The initial counts of b (blue marbles) and r (red marbles), with constraints.
- The relation b = 3 * (b + r) / 5 suggests proportion constraints.
- The red marbles are doubled: newr = 2 * r.
- The total new count is newb + newr (with newb = b).

The goal is to express the ratio newr / newtotal = (2 * r) / (b + 2 * r).

From the constraint b = 3/5 * (b + r), we infer:

b = (3/5)(b + r)
=> 5b = 3b + 3r
=> 2b = 3r
=> b = (3/2) r.

Substituting into the ratio:

newr / newtotal = (2r) / (b + 2r)
= (2r) / ((3/2) r + 2 r)
= (2r) / ((3/2) r + 2 r)
= (2r) / ((3/2 + 2) * r)
= (2r) / ((3/2 + 4/2) * r)
= (2r) / ( (7/2) * r )
= 2 r * (2 / 7 r)
= 4 / 7.

Therefore, the ratio simplifies to 4/7.

Given the problem’s setup and the proportionalities, the ratio is a constant 4/7, regardless of b and r, provided the initial constraints hold.

Thus, the correct closed-form answer in Lean should be:

```lean
(4 : ℚ) / 7
```

In Lean syntax, the entire answer is simply `4/7`.

---

**Final Code:**

<<<(4 : ℚ) / 7>>>

---

**Explanation:**

The initial proportion condition relates b and r and reduces to b = (3/2) r. The ratio of doubled red marbles to total marbles simplifies to a constant 4/7. The previous erroneous attempt was due to using `<<<` which is invalid syntax in Lean for an abbreviation. Removing that and directly defining the ratio as `4/7` gives a correct, closed-form, and general answer.
