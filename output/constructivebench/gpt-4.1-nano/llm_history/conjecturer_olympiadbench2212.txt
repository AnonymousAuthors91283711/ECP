Given the recurrence relation and boundary condition, the solution resembles a quadratic form with roots linked to n. The pattern and boundary conditions suggest the maximum N scales linearly with n, specifically N = n - 1. Thus, the final answer in Lean is:

<<<fun n => n - 1>>>

This aligns with the enumerated pattern and the problem's structure.
