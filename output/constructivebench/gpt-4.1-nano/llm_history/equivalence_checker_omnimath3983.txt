Ground Truth Answer: fun m => {k : ℤ | ∃ n : ℕ, k = 2 ^ n}
Proposed Answer: fun m : ℕ => {a₁ : ℤ | abs a₁ ≤ 2^m}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
- We have a recursive sequence a(n) defined based on whether a(n) is less than 2^m or not
- The sequence either squares and adds 2^m (if <2^m) or halves the value (if ≥2^m)
- We need to characterize the initial values a(1) that ensure all a(n) remain integers

Ground Truth Answer:
- The correct answer shows that valid starting points are powers of 2 (2^n)
- This makes sense because:
  - Squaring and adding 2^m preserves integrality for powers of 2
  - Halving preserves integrality for even numbers (which powers of 2 are)

Proposed Answer:
- Suggests that any a(1) with absolute value ≤2^m works
- This is incorrect because:
  - Many numbers ≤2^m in absolute value won't maintain integrality when squared and added to 2^m
  - For example, a(1)=3 would give non-integer results when halved after growing beyond 2^m

The proposed answer is too permissive and doesn't guarantee the integrality condition for all n.
