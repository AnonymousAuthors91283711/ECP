abbrev mathodyssey212_answer : ℝ × ℝ := sorry
theorem mathodyssey212 : 
  (logb 4 (1/64) = mathodyssey212_answer.1) ∧ (logb 5 625 = mathodyssey212_answer.2) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ × ℝ
The logs are computed as follows: log_b4(1/64) = log_b4(64^{-1}) = -log_b4(64). Since 64=4^3, log_b4(64)=3, so result = -3. For log_b5(625)=log_b5(5^4)=4. 

Final answer: <<<(-3, 4)>>>
