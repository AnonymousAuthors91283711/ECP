theorem omnimath2952 : 
  (fun x => x - 5) 0 = omnimath2952_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The enumeration hints at the value of the expression (x - 5) at x = 0, which equals 0 - 5 = -5. The pattern suggests the answer is simply this evaluated value, generalized as a constant function.
