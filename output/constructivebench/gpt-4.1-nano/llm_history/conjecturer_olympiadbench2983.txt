theorem olympiadbench2983 :
  ∃ (a b c d : ℕ), 0 < a ∧ 0 < b ∧ 0 < c ∧ 0 < d ∧
  a.factorial * b.factorial * c.factorial = d.factorial ∧
  a + b + c + d = 37 ∧
  a * b * c * d = olympiadbench2983_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests that the answer involves factorials of small integers that sum to 37, with their product matching an exponentiated form. Given the constraints and typical factorizations, the product resembles 6! * 9! * 11! * 11!. Thus, the answer is the product of these factorials.

<<<6! * 9! * 11! * 11!>>>
