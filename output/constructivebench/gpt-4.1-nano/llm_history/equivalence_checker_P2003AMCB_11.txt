Ground Truth Answer: 10 + 25/60
Proposed Answer: 269/12
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a watchTime function that transforms actualTime to a watched time with a rate of 57.6/60 (which is 0.96).

2. We need to find the actualTime (solution) such that watchTime(solution) = 22.

3. The ground truth answer is 10 + 25/60 (which is 10.41666... hours or 10:25 AM).

4. The proposed answer is 269/12 (which is 22.41666... hours).

Now let's check if 269/12 satisfies the equation:
watchTime(269/12) = (269/12 - 12)*0.96 + 12 = (125/12)*0.96 + 12 = 10 + 12 = 22

This satisfies the first condition. For the second condition, since the watch runs slow (0.96 < 1), any t < 269/12 would give watchTime(t) < 22, so 269/12 is indeed the minimal solution.

Now convert the ground truth answer to a fraction:
10 + 25/60 = 625/60 = 125/12

But 269/12 ≠ 125/12, so they are different answers.

However, let's check if 125/12 satisfies the equation:
watchTime(125/12) = (125/12 - 12)*0.96 + 12 = (-19/12)*0.96 + 12 ≈ -1.52 + 12 = 10.48 ≠ 22

This means the ground truth answer doesn't satisfy the equation, while the proposed answer does. Therefore, the proposed answer is correct while the ground truth appears incorrect.
