Based on the pattern, since rows and columns are arithmetic progressions, and the particular entries are given, the answer simplifies to the value at the top-left corner, which affects the entire matrix. Using the given constraints and the pattern from enumerated answers, the consistent closed-form expression related to the entries is:

<<<-144>>>
