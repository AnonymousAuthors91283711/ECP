theorem omnimath2689 (wednesdayPoints fridayPoints : ℕ) :
    fridayPoints = wednesdayPoints * 80 / 100 ↔ fridayPoints = omnimath2689_answer wednesdayPoints := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Because fridayPoints = wednesdayPoints * 80 / 100, the answer simplifies to wednesdayPoints * 4 / 5, assuming integer division.  
<<<fun wednesdayPoints : ℕ => wednesdayPoints * 4 / 5>>>
