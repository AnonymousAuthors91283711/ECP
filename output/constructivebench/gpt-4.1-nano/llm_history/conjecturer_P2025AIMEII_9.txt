theorem P2025AIMEII_9 :
  let f := fun x => sin (7 * π * sin (5 * x))
  let zeros := {x ∈ Ioo 0 (2 * π) | f x = 0}
  let tangent := {x ∈ zeros | HasDerivAt f 0 x}
  Nat.card zeros + Nat.card tangent = P2025AIMEII_9_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The zeros are at x = kπ/7; tangent points where derivative equals zero are at x = mπ/5. They intersect at x = tπ with t ∈ {0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, 5/2, 3, 7/2, 4, 9/2, 5, 11/2, 6, 13/2, 7, 15/2, 8, 17/2, 9, 19/2, 10} within (0, 2π). Counting these, total = 21. So:

<<<21>>>
