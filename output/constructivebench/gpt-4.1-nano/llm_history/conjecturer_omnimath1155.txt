The problem asks for the set of natural numbers n > 0 such that for all k dividing n with k > 0, f k divides f n, where f x = x² + x + 1. The divisibility condition suggests n is composed of prime factors that satisfy this divisibility relation. Checking small n's, it appears that n powers of 3 satisfy the condition, and n=1 trivially does. Larger composites tend to violate the property. The pattern indicates the set contains powers of 3 and 1.
