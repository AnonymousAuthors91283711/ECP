The given conditions define the supremum of the set of all lower bounds of the sequence \( \frac{b(n)}{n^{2}} \). Since \( b(n) / n^{2} \geq r' \) and \( (b(n)) / n^{2} \) is strictly decreasing and starting at 1, the limit as \( n \to \infty \) is the smallest upper bound, which is 0. Therefore, the greatest lower bound (supremum) is 0.
