Ground Truth Answer: 32
Proposed Answer: 24
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us the equation: 13 + (T - 20)/4 = T with the constraint T > 20
2. Let's solve the equation step by step:
   - 13 + (T - 20)/4 = T
   - (T - 20)/4 = T - 13
   - T - 20 = 4(T - 13)
   - T - 20 = 4T - 52
   - -20 + 52 = 4T - T
   - 32 = 3T
   - T = 32/3 ≈ 10.666...

However, this solution violates the constraint T > 20. There seems to be no integer solution that satisfies both the equation and the constraint.

The ground truth answer is 32, but:
- 32 doesn't satisfy the original equation (13 + (32-20)/4 = 13 + 3 = 16 ≠ 32)
- 24 also doesn't satisfy the equation (13 + (24-20)/4 = 13 + 1 = 14 ≠ 24)

Both answers are incorrect, but they're incorrect in different ways. The ground truth answer is closer to satisfying the equation numerically (though still incorrect), while the proposed answer is further off.

<<<False>>>
