(f : ℝ → ℕ)
(hf : ∀ x : ℝ, x > 0 → f x = {p : ℕ | p.Prime ∧ x ≤ p ∧ p ≤ x + 10}.ncard)

Given the problem context, f maps positive real numbers to the count of primes within [x, x+10], and it's applied twice on 20. The primes in [20,30] are 23, 29; in [23,33], primes are 23, 29, 31. The count for 20 is 2, then for 23, it's 3. The outcome should be 3, following the pattern.
