  n = olympiadbench2286_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Since t(k+1) = t(k) + d and t(3) = 5, t(k) is linear: t(k) = 5 + (k - 3)d.
Sum of t over 0 to n-1 is an arithmetic series: sum = (n * (t(1) + t(n))) / 2.
Given t(n-1) + t(n-2) = 95 and the sum = 1000, solving yields n = 20.
So, olympiadbench2286_answer = 20.
