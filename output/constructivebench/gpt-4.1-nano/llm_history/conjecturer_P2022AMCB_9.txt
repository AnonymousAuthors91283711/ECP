The problem involves identifying the least value satisfying inequalities involving a sequence pattern, logarithms, and differences. The sequence typically appears as an arithmetic progression rooted at constraints involving log₂, which suggests examining the minimal starting term that satisfies these bounds. The enumeration hints point towards the minimal such value being 4, based on the pattern of n, differences, and bounds checked.

Thus, the final minimal solution, consolidating the constraints and inequalities, is:

<<<4>>>
