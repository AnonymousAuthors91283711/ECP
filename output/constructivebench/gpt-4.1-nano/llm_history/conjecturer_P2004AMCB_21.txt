Based on the problem of finding the extremal ratio y/x with constraints, the maximum ratio occurs where the gradient conditions reveal the ratio's value. The ratio at critical points is given by the roots of a quadratic in y/x, leading to the extremal values. The pattern indicates the extremal ratio is (3 + √17)/2.

<<<(3 + sqrt 17) / 2>>>
