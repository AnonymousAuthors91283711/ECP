The integers in the set satisfy the equations: a + b c = 20 and -a + c d = 19. Combining gives (a + b c) + (-a + c d) = 39 ⇒ b c + c d = 39 ⇒ c (b + d) = 39. To maximize c, choose the divisor of 39 with the largest absolute value, which is 39 itself. For c = 39, (b + d) = 1. To satisfy the original equations, pick a = 20 - b c = 20 - 39 b, then -a + c d = 19. Set b = 0, then a = 20, and c d = 19 + a ⇒ 39 d = 39 ⇒ d = 1. The maximal c is 39.
