: IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (∑ i in Finset.Icc 1 n, (1 : ℝ) / (Real.cot (i * Real.pi / (n + 1)) - Real.cot (i * Real.pi / n))) = 1} P2000AIMEII_15_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sum simplifies to 1 for n ≥ 2, matching the pattern of cotangent sums over n divisions. For n=2, the sum evaluates to 1; for smaller n, undefined or 0. Thus, the minimal n satisfying the sum equals 1 is n = 2.
