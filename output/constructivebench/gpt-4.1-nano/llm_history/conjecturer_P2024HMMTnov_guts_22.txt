Based on the pattern and problem constraints, the number of such k is the count of integers from 1 to 50 that are not squares larger than 1, i.e., excluding perfect squares p^2 > 1 with p prime, where gcd condition fails; the only prohibited k are perfect squares p^2 with p prime, specifically 4, 9, 25, 49. Counting rest gives 50 - 4 = 46.
