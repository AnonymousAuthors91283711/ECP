The problem identifies minimal positive coprime pairs (m, n) related to ratios derived from injective mappings from a 9-element subset of ℕ. The minimal such ratio is achieved when the numerator is minimized and the denominator maximized within the constraints, likely when the numerator corresponds to the minimal positive product difference, and the denominator corresponds to the maximal product within the injective assignment. The minimal ratio corresponds approximately to the ratio of the smallest non-zero value over the largest value respecting the constraints, leading to (1, 72).
