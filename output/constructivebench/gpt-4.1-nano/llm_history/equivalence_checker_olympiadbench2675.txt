Ground Truth Answer: 491
Proposed Answer: 86
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence where:
   - a₁ = 1
   - aₙ₊₁ = ceil(√(aₙ² + 34))
   - We need to find the smallest n where aₙ > 100*T (where T=5, so 500)

2. The ground truth answer is 491, which means it takes 491 steps for the sequence to exceed 500.

3. The proposed answer is 86, which is significantly smaller than 491.

4. Let's consider the sequence growth:
   - The sequence grows roughly like √(aₙ² + 34) ≈ aₙ + 17/aₙ (for large aₙ)
   - This suggests sublinear growth
   - It would indeed take many steps to go from 1 to over 500

5. The proposed answer of 86 is clearly too small, as the sequence grows much more slowly than that.
