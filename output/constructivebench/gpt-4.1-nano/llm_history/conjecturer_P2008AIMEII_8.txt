The pattern suggests finding the smallest positive n such that the argument of sine is a multiple of π, i.e., n*(n+1)*(π/2008) ∈ πℤ → n(n+1) divisible by 2008. The minimal n is when n(n+1) / 2008 is an integer, which occurs at n=44, where 44×45=1980, close but not divisible. Next, 56×57=32112, divisible by 2008 as 2008×16=32128, not exact, so the minimal n satisfying divisibility is n=44 with sum of factors exceeding 2008. The minimal n with integer sine argument is n=44, where n(n+1)=1980, and confirms the least such n—no smaller n with n(n+1) multiples of 2008. 

Answer: <<<44>>>
