theorem omnimath2664 :
  let pairs := [(1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1)]

Ground Truth Answer: 4180
Proposed Answer: 2^(2*6 + 2) - 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines 4 pairs and calculates 2^(2*y) for each pair, then sums these values.
2. Calculating each term:
   - (1,6): 2^(2*6) = 2^12 = 4096
   - (2,3): 2^(2*3) = 2^6 = 64
   - (3,2): 2^(2*2) = 2^4 = 16
   - (6,1): 2^(2*1) = 2^2 = 4
3. Sum: 4096 + 64 + 16 + 4 = 4180 (matches ground truth)
4. Proposed answer: 2^(2*6 + 2) - 1 = 2^(14) - 1 = 16384 - 1 = 16383 ≠ 4180

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth. The proposed formula doesn't correctly represent the sum of these specific terms.
