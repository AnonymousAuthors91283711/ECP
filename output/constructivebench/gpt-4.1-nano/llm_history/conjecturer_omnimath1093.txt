The problem asks for the set of differences `d = b - a` where `a` and `b` are palindromic 5-digit numbers within [10000, 99999], with no palindromic numbers strictly between them, and `a < b`. The minimal difference is 2 (e.g., between 10001 and 10003), and the maximum difference occurs when the two palindromes differ most significantly, which is 99999 - 10001 = 89998.

Since all 5-digit palindromes can be paired with the next non-intervening palindrome at minimal and maximum gaps, and any multiple of the gap size within limits is possible, the set of differences `d` includes all even numbers from 2 up to 89998.

The problem is about the set of differences between consecutive palindromic 5-digit numbers with no palindromes in between. Since 5-digit palindromes are symmetric and structured, they follow a pattern: they are generated from a 3-digit prefix (a number between 100 and 999), forming palindromes like `abcba`, where `a` ≠ 0. 

Between two consecutive palindromes with such structure, the difference depends on how the prefix changes. Because the outer digits change by steps of 1, and the inner digits are symmetric, the minimal difference between two successive palindromes is 2, which occurs when the central digit shifts, e.g., between 10001 and 10021, assuming both are palindromes.

The maximum difference is when the prefix jumps from 19999 to 99999, which results in the greatest difference: 99999 - 10001 = 89998.

Concerning whether all even numbers between 2 and 89998 are achievable differences, since palindromes are evenly spaced in the space of 5-digit numbers and their pattern allows stepping in increments of 2, the differences follow an even number pattern.

Therefore, the set of all such differences is precisely the set of even numbers from 2 up to 89998.

Fixing the error: in Lean, the set should be defined as a set comprehension, and the 'where' token in the original is misplaced. The correct syntax involves defining the set with a colon, then using a predicate inside {} braces, with direct notation.

The problem involves characterizing the set of differences between consecutive 5-digit palindromic numbers with no other palindromic numbers in between. 5-digit palindromes are of the form `abcba`, with `a` in 1..9 and `b,c` in 0..9, where the number is fully determined by 3 digits. The differences between these palindromes depend on how the prefix `abc` changes, especially since these are symmetric.

Patterning the palindromes: the smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10001 (`a=1, b=0, c=0`) and the largest is 99999 (`a=9, b=9, c=9`). Incrementing the palindrome corresponds predominantly to increasing the prefix `abc` by steps of 1, which leads the difference to be generally 2 (for adjacent palindromes differing by 1 in the prefix, as the middle digit cycles).

Between the smallest and largest, the difference between two consecutive palindromes is at least 2 (since they change by an increment of 1 in the prefix), and the maximum difference corresponds to jumping from `abc=199` (for 19991) to `abc=999` (99999), yielding a difference of 99999 - 10001 = 89998. The set of all such differences is the set of even numbers starting from 2 up to 89998.

Hence, the set of differences is exactly all even integers between 2 and 89998, inclusive.

In Lean, the set should be expressed via a set comprehension with a predicate, following the correct syntax.

Final answer:
<<<{d : ℕ | 2 ≤ d ∧ d ≤ 89998 ∧ d % 2 = 0}>>>
