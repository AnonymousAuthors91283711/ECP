    actualWidth = mathodyssey180_answer modelWidth := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
Since the options appear to follow a pattern derived from the input, and the pattern in enumerated answers suggests a function involving the modelWidth scaled appropriately, a natural conjecture is that the answer adjusts actualWidth proportionally by a factor involving modelWidth. 

Given typical proportionality, the answer is \( actualWidth = modelWidth * \frac{5}{6} \). 

Expressed in Lean:

<<<fun modelWidth => modelWidth * (5 / 6)>>>
