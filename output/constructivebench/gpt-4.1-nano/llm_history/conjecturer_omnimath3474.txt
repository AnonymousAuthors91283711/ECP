  ¬∃ (k : ℕ), 3 * k + 2 * k = omnimath3474_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern and the form of the question, the answer likely involves the sum of an arithmetic sequence or a similar pattern. Since the verdict mentions that no such k exists for the sum being equal, the sum must be a value that cannot be expressed as 5k. From the enumerated answers, it suggests that the sum is 0, which cannot be expressed as 5k. Therefore, the answer is 0.
