theorem olympiadbench2369 :
  ∃! (gh : ℕ × ℕ), 19 * gh.1 + 17 * gh.2 = 201 ∧ gh.1 > 0 ∧ gh.2 > 0 ∧ olympiadbench2369_answer = gh := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
The unique pair satisfying the linear equation with positive integers is obtained from solving for one variable and checking positivity. Solving for gh.1: gh.1 = (201 - 17 * gh.2) / 19, which must be an integer > 0, and similarly for gh.2.  
The only positive integer solutions are (3, 12) and (15, 0). Since gh.2 > 0, discard (15, 0).  
Thus, final answer: <<<(3, 12)>>>
