Given the pattern of reach probabilities for m=15 and m=20, and considering the typical structure in such probability problems involving powers of 1/2, the difference suggests a sum of geometric terms. The final conclusive closed-form, generalized for reach_prob m, involves summing terms of (1/2)^{k} scaled appropriately to m. Based on insights, the simplified formula for the difference is:

<<<(1/2)^15 * (1 - (1/2)^{5})/ (1 - 1/2)>>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The issue arises because Lean interprets `(1/2)^15 * (1 - (1/2)^{5})/ (1 - 1/2)` as an expression expecting a `?m` (metavariable) which suggests improper parentheses or order of operations leading to syntax or type issues. 

In Lean, when mixing rational numbers and powers, explicit parentheses around numerator and denominator are essential to ensure proper parsing and precedence. Also, to avoid Lean's parsing ambiguities, it's better to explicitly parenthesize numerator and denominator in the fraction.

Given the pattern in the formula (which resembles a geometric probability calculation over a finite number of steps), the closed form is:

\[ (1/2)^{n} \times \frac{1 - (1/2)^{m}}{1 - 1/2} \]

for reach probabilities over `n`. Here, in the difference between reach_prob 20 and reach_prob 15, it looks like the pattern is:

\[ (1/2)^{15} \times \frac{1 - (1/2)^{5}}{1 - 1/2} \]

which is the difference of two partial sums of a geometric series. We need to correctly write the expression with explicit parentheses for clarity. 

Thus, the fixed answer is:

<<<(1/2)^15 * ((1 - (1/2)^5) / (1 - 1/2))>>>

This expression should synthesize correctly and aligns with the given pattern.

**Final answer:**

<<<(1/2)^15 * ((1 - (1/2)^5) / (1 - 1/2))>>>
