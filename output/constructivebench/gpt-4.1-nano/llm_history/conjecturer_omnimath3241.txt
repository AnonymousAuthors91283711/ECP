Given the symmetry constraint and degree bound, the minimal non-zero balanced polynomial that satisfies the integral condition is typically constant (degree 0). Since degree ≤ 2009 and the polynomial must be balanced (e.g., Sine and Cosine components), the simplest such polynomial is the constant polynomial. Thus:
