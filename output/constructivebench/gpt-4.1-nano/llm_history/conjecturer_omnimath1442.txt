noncomputable abbrev omnimath1442_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1442
: (∑' n : ℕ, (n + 1) * (1 / 1998) ^ n = omnimath1442_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The sum is a geometric series with ratio r = 1/1998, and the series sum for |r| < 1 is a / (1 - r), where a = (1 + 0) = 1. Therefore, the sum is 1 / (1 - 1/1998) = 1 / (1997/1998) = 1998/1997. The expression should be a closed form in ℝ.
