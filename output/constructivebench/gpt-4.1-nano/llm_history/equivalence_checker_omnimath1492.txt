Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0), (1, 1)}
Proposed Answer: { (n, m) | 2^(3^n.natAbs) = 3^(2^m.natAbs) - 1 }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is technically correct as it describes the solution set exactly as defined by the equation. However, it doesn't explicitly list the concrete solutions like the ground truth answer does. The ground truth answer {(0, 0), (1, 1)} is a more explicit and complete representation of the solution set, while the proposed answer is a set comprehension that would evaluate to the same solutions. They are equivalent in terms of the solutions they represent, but differ in form.
