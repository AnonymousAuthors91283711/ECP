Ground Truth Answer: (1, 1/2, -1/2, 1/3)
Proposed Answer: (1, 0, 0, 0)
Let's verify the proposed answer (1, 0, 0, 0) against each equation:

1. First equation: √1 - 1/0 - 2*0 + 3*0 = 1 - undefined (division by zero) → Invalid
2. Second equation: 1 + 1/0² - 4*0² - 9*0² = 1 + undefined → Invalid
3. Third equation: 1*√1 - 1/0³ - 8*0³ + 27*0³ = 1 - undefined → Invalid
4. Fourth equation: 1² + 1/0⁴ - 16*0⁴ - 81*0⁴ = 1 + undefined → Invalid

The proposed answer causes division by zero in all equations, making it invalid. The ground truth answer (1, 1/2, -1/2, 1/3) satisfies all equations properly.
