theorem P2011AMCA_5 : 
  P2011AMCA_5_answer = (30 : ℚ) / (100 - 25) * 100 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Given the pattern in enumerated answers and the simplified expression (30 / (100 - 25)) * 100, which evaluates to (30 / 75) * 100 = (2/5) * 100 = 40, the closed form should reflect this ratio. 

The expression reduces to (k / (m - n)) * total, which generalizes to (30 / 75) * 100.
