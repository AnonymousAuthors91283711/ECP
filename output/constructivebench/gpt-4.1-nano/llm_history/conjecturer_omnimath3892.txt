Since the equation (x - a)(x - b) = (x - c)(x - d) simplifies to a quadratic, solving yields two roots. The roots are symmetric around the midpoint of a and d, and also around b and c, with differences arising from their constraints. After analysis, the roots follow the pattern of the set { (a + d)/2 ± (b - c)/2 }. The difference (a + d)/2 - (b + c)/2 simplifies to (a - c + d - b)/2. Because a + d = 2015 and b + c = 2015, it simplifies further to (a - c + d - b)/2 = ((a - c) + (d - b))/2. Introducing these, the roots are (2015)/2 ± (a - c)/2, matching the set {(2015/2) + (a - c)/2, (2015/2) - (a - c)/2}. 

Thus, the answer is:

<<<(2015 / 2) + (a - c) / 2, (2015 / 2) - (a - c) / 2>>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error occurs because in Lean, when defining an abbreviation with 'abbrev', the variables 'a' and 'c' are not in scope within the definition; they are only available within the theorem's context. To fix this, the answer should be expressed as a function of the same parameters, i.e., it should be a function ℝ → ℝ, taking (a, c) as inputs. Also, the notation should be enclosed entirely within 'fun' λ-notations or lambda syntax.

Given the equation (x - a)(x - b) = (x - c)(x - d), and using the conditions:
- a + d = 2015,
- b + c = 2015,

We derive that the solutions are centered at the midpoint of the sum a + d (which is 2015) or c + b, and the solutions are symmetric around this point. The roots are at (2015/2) ± (a - c)/2, which accounts for the variation in a and c.

Thus, a suitable final answer expression is a *function* of a and c, that is, for parameters a and c:

```lean
fun a c => (2015 / 2) + (a - c) / 2
-- and the other root: (2015 / 2) - (a - c) / 2
```

In order to meet the theorem statement which asks for a set of solutions, I will define the set of solutions as the set containing these two roots.

Final answer:

<<<
{λ a c, (2015 / 2) + (a - c) / 2, (2015 / 2) - (a - c) / 2}
>>>

This set contains the two roots expressed explicitly in terms of the parameters 'a' and 'c', satisfying the equation. It is a concise closed-form expression, generalized from the enumerated answer, and aligns with the problem's structure.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Let's analyze the problem:

- The set of solutions to the equation \((x - a)(x - b) = (x - c)(x - d)\) is a quadratic in \(x\).
- The solutions are given by quadratic roots, with the sum of solutions being \(a + b = c + d\). Since \(a + d = 2015\) and \(b + c = 2015\), it follows that the sum of roots is \(a + b = c + d = 2015\).
- The difference in roots is determined by the difference in \((a, d)\) and \((b, c)\).

The roots of the quadratic are:

\[
x = \frac{a + b}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{(a - c)^2}}{2} = \frac{2015}{2} \pm \frac{|a - c|}{2}
\]

Given that \(a \neq c\), the roots are distinct and are:

\[
\left\{ \frac{2015}{2} + \frac{|a - c|}{2}, \frac{2015}{2} - \frac{|a - c|}{2} \right\}
\]

In Lean, the absolute value operation is `abs`. Also, the set of solutions can be represented as a code template:

```lean
{ x | x = (2015 / 2) + (|a - c|) / 2 } ∪ { x | x = (2015 / 2) - (|a - c|) / 2 }
```

But here, the user wants a single expression for the entire set, which matches the pattern in the enumerations. Therefore, I will construct an expression that explicitly describes the set of solutions as those two roots.

The issue with the original code:

```lean
fun a c => (2015 / 2) + (a - c) / 2
```

is that it does not include the absolute value, and uses a function with parameters `a c`, but does not fully specify the set of solutions as a set.

I will generalize this to:

```lean
{ x | x = (2015 / 2) + abs (a - c) / 2 } ∪ { x | x = (2015 / 2) - abs (a - c) / 2 }
```

which ensures correctness and matches the two roots.

Final answer enclosed with delimiter:

<<<
{ x | x = (2015 / 2) + abs (a - c) / 2 } ∪ { x | x = (2015 / 2) - abs (a - c) / 2 }
>>>

This is a succinct, closed-form description of the solution set, matches the enumeration, and aligns with the set's structure derived from the quadratic formula.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The errors indicate that within the definition of `omnimath3892_answer`, Lean does not recognize `a` and `c` because it expects a closed-form expression independent of specific variables; and also that the syntax for union over a set of real numbers is incorrect. To correct this, note that the solution set of `(x - a)(x - b) = (x - c)(x - d)` reduces to the roots of a quadratic polynomial obtained from expanding and simplifying the equality.

Given the constraints:
- \(a + d = 2015\),
- \(b + c = 2015\),
- \(a \neq c\). 

The quadratic simplifies to \(x^2 - (a + d + b + c) x + (ab - cd) = 0\).
Plugging in \(a + d = 2015\) and \(b + c = 2015\), the sum \(a + d + b + c = 4030\).

The roots of the quadratic are:
\[
x = \frac{(a+d + b+c) \pm \sqrt{(a+d + b+c)^2 - 4(ab - cd)}}{2}
\]

which further reduces, by substituting known sums and exploiting the symmetry, to:
\[
x = 2015/2 \pm \frac{|a - c|}{2}
\]

The set of solutions is thus the two roots, and can be represented as:

```lean
{ x | x = (2015 / 2) + |a - c| / 2 } ∪ { x | x = (2015 / 2) - |a - c| / 2 }
```

However, in Lean, to define a named constant set, we need to correctly specify the set and avoid syntax errors. Since we are working with real numbers, the union should be over sets of ℝ, constructed via `set.union` or notation, and `abs` should be explicitly used in Lean.

The corrected code is:

```lean
noncomputable abbrev omnimath3892_answer : set ℝ := 
{ x | x = (2015 / 2) + abs (a - c) / 2 } ∪ { x | x = (2015 / 2) - abs (a - c) / 2 }
```

And in the theorem statement, we should state that the solution set equals this set, where the variable `a` and `c` are parameters, not free variables inside the set.

The main issue stems from defining `omnimath3892_answer` as an abssent set `{x | ... }` in `ℝ`, which is not directly allowed in Lean because sets over ℝ are not in `AddGroup` and the syntax `{ x | ... }` produces a `Set ℝ`, not an `ℝ`. The problem is that the answer is expected to be a *single* real number or a finite set of real numbers, not a set.

Given the pattern from enumerated answers and typical solutions for quadratic equations of the form `(x - a)(x - b) = (x - c)(x - d)`, one can derive the solutions explicitly.

From the initial equation:
\[ (x-a)(x-b) = (x-c)(x-d) \]
which expands to:
\[ x^2 - (a+b)x + ab = x^2 - (c+d)x + cd \]
simplifies to:
\[ (a+b - c - d) x = ab - cd \]
Since \(a + d = 2015\) and \(b + c = 2015\), then:
\[ a + b = 2015 + c \]
\[ c + d = 2015 + b \]
but these identities do not directly simplify the coefficient of \(x\), so rearranging suggests the solutions are:
\[ x = \frac{ab - cd}{a + b - c - d} \]
But with the constraints, the solutions end up being symmetric around the midpoint.

It turns out the solutions are:
\[ x = \frac{(a + d) + (b + c)}{2} \pm \frac{|a - c|}{2} \]
Given \(a + d = 2015\), \(b + c = 2015\), the numerator becomes \(2015 + 2015 = 4030\),
and the difference is \(|a - c|\).

Therefore, the two solutions are:
\[ x = \frac{4030}{2} \pm \frac{|a - c|}{2} \]
which simplifies to:
\[ x = 2015 \pm \frac{|a - c|}{2} \]

Thus, the **answer** in Lean as a real expression is:
```lean
x = 2015 + |a - c| / 2
x = 2015 - |a - c| / 2
```

Since only a single real number of the two possible solutions is asked (or possibly the set), the correct answer in Lean should be these two solutions expressed as a set of solutions.

Fixing the code, I will express the answer as a `set` of two real numbers:

```lean
{ x | x = 2015 + |a - c| / 2 } ∪ { x | x = 2015 - |a - c| / 2 }
```

Within Lean, sets are written as `Set ℝ`. The previous code attempted to define an `abbrev` as a real number, but more appropriately, the solution is a set of solutions.

Hence, the final fixed answer:

```lean
<<<{ x | x = 2015 + |a - c| / 2 } ∪ { x | x = 2015 - |a - c| / 2 }>>> 
```
This is a set of two real solutions based on the problem's constraints and symmetry.
