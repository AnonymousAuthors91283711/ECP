The function \( y = \sin(\arctan(x/9) - \arctan(x/16)) \) reaches its maximum when the angle difference is maximized, which occurs as \( x \to \infty \). Using the tangent subtraction formula, the limit simplifies to \(\frac{(x/9) - (x/16)}{1 + (x/9)(x/16)} \to 0\), but \(\sin\) approaches 1 when the angle difference tends to \(\pi/2\). Hence, the supremum is 1, but not attained for finite \( x \).

Thus, the greatest value approaches 1.
