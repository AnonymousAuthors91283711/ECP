Ground Truth Answer: (-1 + sqrt 5) / 2
Proposed Answer: (sqrt ((sqrt 5 - 1) / 2))
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a unique positive real x satisfying:
   - 0 < x
   - cos(arctan x) = x
   - x² equals some constant (omnimath1366_answer)

2. Ground truth answer: (-1 + sqrt 5)/2 ≈ 0.618034 (golden ratio minus 1)

3. Proposed answer: sqrt((sqrt 5 - 1)/2) ≈ sqrt(0.618034) ≈ 0.786151

Let's verify:
- For ground truth x = (-1 + sqrt 5)/2:
  x² = (1 - 2sqrt5 + 5)/4 = (6 - 2sqrt5)/4 = (3 - sqrt5)/2
  cos(arctan x) = 1/sqrt(1 + x²) = 1/sqrt(1 + (3-sqrt5)/2) = 1/sqrt((5-sqrt5)/2) ≈ 0.618034 = x

- For proposed answer x = sqrt((sqrt5 - 1)/2):
  x² = (sqrt5 - 1)/2 ≈ 0.618034
  cos(arctan x) = 1/sqrt(1 + x²) = 1/sqrt(1 + (sqrt5-1)/2) = 1/sqrt((sqrt5+1)/2) ≈ 0.786151 ≠ x

The proposed answer gives x ≈ 0.786151 but the equation requires cos(arctan x) = x ≈ 0.618034. They don't match.
