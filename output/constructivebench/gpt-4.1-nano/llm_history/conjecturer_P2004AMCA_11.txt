theorem P2004AMCA_11
    (p n d q : ℕ)
    (havg : (p + 5 * n + 10 * d + 25 * q) / (p + n + d + q) = 20)
    (havg2 : (p + 5 * n + 10 * d + 25 * (q + 1)) / (p + n + d + q + 1) = 21) :
    d = P2004AMCA_11_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The two averages imply that the ratio \( \frac{p + 5 n + 10 d + 25 q}{p + n + d + q} \) is close to 20, and after incrementing \(q\), the ratio increases to 21. Solving these suggests that \(d\) relates to the difference in these ratios, leading to \(d=65\).
