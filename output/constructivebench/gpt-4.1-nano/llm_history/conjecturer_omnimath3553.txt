: {(p, q) : ℕ × ℕ | Nat.Prime p ∧ Nat.Prime q ∧ 3 * p ^ (q - 1) + 1 ∣ 11 ^ p + 17 ^ p} = omnimath3553_answer ↔ True := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
The pattern in enumerated answers suggests pairs where p and q are primes satisfying specific divisibility conditions. Given the structure 3 * p ^ (q - 1) + 1 divides 11^p + 17^p, and the primes involved, a natural closed form involves pairs where p is 2 or 3, and q is 2 or 3, leading to small prime pairs satisfying the divisibility. 

Final answer:
<<<{(p, q) | p = 2 ∧ q = 2} ∪ {(p, q) | p = 3 ∧ q = 2} ∪ {(p, q) | p = 2 ∧ q = 3}>>>
