theorem olympiadbench2832 (T : ℕ) (hT : 0 < T) :
  let minNum := 10^(T - 1)
  let N := if minNum % 33 = 0 then minNum else minNum + (33 - minNum % 33)
  (N % 10) * ((N / 10) % 10) = olympiadbench2832_answer T := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Based on the enumeration pattern, the constructed N is divisible by 33 with its last two digits as minNum's last two digits, which are always 1 followed by zeros, thus the product of the last two digits of N is always 1*0=0. The other expression is independent of T's specifics, so a constant answer is plausible. The pattern suggests that the last two digits of N are always 1 and 0, making their product 0.
