The condition involves the set S with elements between 1 and 2015, and the property that for any two distinct elements a, b in S, (a-b) does not divide (a+b). The divisibility constraint implies a certain restriction on differences, suggesting the set of possible sizes is linked to particular patterns in numbers. Since the set is limited to 1..2015 and the divisibility condition avoids differences dividing sums, the maximal size is affected by parity and spacing constraints. Based on these patterns, the maximum size is 1008, corresponding to selecting either all even or all odd numbers within that range, which satisfies the condition.

The error indicates that in defining `abbrev omnimath2219_answer`, I used a free text explanation, which is not valid syntax in Lean. To fix this, I should assign a direct, closed-form answer in ℕ (a natural number). 

From the description, the key insight is that choosing all the even numbers or all the odd numbers between 1 and 2015 maximizes the size while satisfying the divisibility condition: for any two distinct elements, `(a-b)` does not divide `(a+b)`, which is assured if all elements are of the same parity, since the difference is even, and sums have a fixed parity.

Between 1 and 2015, there are 1008 odd numbers and 1007 even numbers, but as the maximum size set, selecting all odd numbers yields a size of 1008. This matches the pattern in the explanation and the pattern of maximal subset size under the constraints.

Thus, a compact closed-form that yields the maximum k is `1008`. 

Here is the corrected version, which assigns a numeric value:

<<<1008>>>

This value is what the theorem states as the greatest size of such a set satisfying the properties.
