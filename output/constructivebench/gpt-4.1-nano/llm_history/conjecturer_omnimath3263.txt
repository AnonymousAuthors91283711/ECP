abbrev omnimath3263_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3263
: (2.4 * 10 ^ 8 * 2 = omnimath3263_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the pattern in enumerated answers, which likely involve powers of 2 scaled by constants, and the theorem stating the answer equals \( 2.4 \times 10^8 \times 2 \), the simplified form is:

<<<(2.4 * 10 ^ 8) * 2>>>
