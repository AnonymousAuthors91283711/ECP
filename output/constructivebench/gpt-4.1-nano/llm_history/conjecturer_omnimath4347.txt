theorem omnimath4347 (n : ℕ) (h : 10 < n ∧ n < 20) :
    (∃ k : ℕ, 4 * k + 5 * k = n^2 ∧ n^2 % 9 = 0) ↔ n ∈ omnimath4347_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The conditions are 4k + 5k = 9k = n^2 with n between 10 and 20, and n^2 divisible by 9. Since n^2 is divisible by 9, n must be divisible by 3. The only n in (10, 20) divisible by 3 are 12, 15, and 18. Corresponding k values are 12^2/9=16, 15^2/9=25, 18^2/9=36, so k=16, 25, and 36. Thus, the set of such n is {12,15,18}.
