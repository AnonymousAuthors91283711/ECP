Ground Truth Answer: 973
Proposed Answer: (5 * 12 + 2) * 2 + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem defines a sequence with specific values for n=0 to 10 and a recursive definition for n≥11.
2. It asks to find the largest n where seq(n) < 1000, then compute n + seq(n).
3. The ground truth answer is 973, which comes from n=43 (seq(43)=930) since 43+930=973.

The proposed answer is (5*12+2)*2+1 which evaluates to:
(60+2)*2+1 = 62*2+1 = 124+1 = 125

This is clearly different from the ground truth answer of 973. The proposed answer doesn't seem to relate to the sequence or the problem requirements in any meaningful way.
