Ground Truth Answer: 1/3
Proposed Answer: 16 + 4 * √15
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the greatest value of an infinite series ∑(cos θ')^n where θ' satisfies sin θ' = √(T²-64)/T with T=32.

2. The series ∑(cos θ')^n is a geometric series that converges to 1/(1 - cos θ') when |cos θ'| < 1.

3. For T=32, we have:
   sin θ' = √(32²-64)/32 = √(1024-64)/32 = √960/32 = (4√15)/32 = √15/8

4. Then cos θ' = √(1 - sin²θ') = √(1 - 15/64) = √(49/64) = 7/8

5. The series sum would be 1/(1 - 7/8) = 1/(1/8) = 8

However, neither the ground truth (1/3) nor the proposed answer (16 + 4√15) matches this calculation. The correct answer should be 8.
