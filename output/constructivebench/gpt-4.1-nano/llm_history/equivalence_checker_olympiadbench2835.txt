Ground Truth Answer: 32
Proposed Answer: (2 ^ (10 + 12)) * 13 ^ (10) * 3 ^ (12) * 5 ^ (12) * 7 ^ (12)
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is asking for the number of pairs (a,b) of positive integers where:
1. a and b are coprime (gcd(a,b)=1)
2. a*b = T^20 * 210^12 where T = √26

First, let's simplify the expression:
T^20 = (√26)^20 = 26^10 = (2*13)^10 = 2^10 * 13^10
210^12 = (2*3*5*7)^12 = 2^12 * 3^12 * 5^12 * 7^12

So a*b = 2^(10+12) * 3^12 * 5^12 * 7^12 * 13^10 = 2^22 * 3^12 * 5^12 * 7^12 * 13^10

Since a and b must be coprime, we need to partition the prime factors completely into either a or b (no overlapping factors). For each distinct prime, we have 2 choices (assign to a or b).

There are 5 distinct primes here (2,3,5,7,13), so the number of ways is 2^5 = 32.

The proposed answer gives the factorization of a*b, but the question asks for the number of coprime pairs (a,b) that satisfy the condition. These are different things - one is a factorization, the other is a count.
