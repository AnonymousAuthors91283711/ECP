  n = mathodyssey36_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern and the need for a minimal n where such a decomposition is possible, the pattern suggests that the minimal n is 2. The quadratic \(x^2 + x + 4\) can be expressed as a sum of one squared linear polynomial, but may not be decomposable into any fewer terms.  

Final answer: <<<2>>>
