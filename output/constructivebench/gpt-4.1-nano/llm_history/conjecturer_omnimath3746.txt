open Nat Polynomial

abbrev omnimath3746_answer : Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath3746 : 
  ¬ ∃ (f : ℕ[X]), degree f = 2 ∧ 
    (∀ (n : ℕ), ∃ (k : ℕ), eval n f = 2^k) ↔ omnimath3746_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Prop
The pattern suggests the problem asks whether a quadratic polynomial can encode all powers of 2 at each natural number, which is known to be impossible. Then, the answer being a Prop that captures the negation of such an existential is

<<<∀ (f : ℕ[X]), degree f = 2 → (∀ n : ℕ, ∃ k : ℕ, eval n f = 2^k) → false>>>
