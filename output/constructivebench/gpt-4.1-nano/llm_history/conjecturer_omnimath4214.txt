theorem omnimath4214 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ a b : ℕ, ∃ (x y z : ℕ), x = a ∧ y = f b ∧ z = f (b + f a - 1) ∧ x + y > z ∧ y + z > x ∧ z + x > y) ↔ f = omnimath4214_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Given the inequalities, the variables form a triangle with sides x=a, y=f b, z=f (b + f a - 1). To satisfy all inequalities for arbitrary a,b, the minimal consistent choice is when f is the identity function, ensuring triangle inequalities.  
Therefore, the answer is: <<<fun n : ℕ => n>>>
