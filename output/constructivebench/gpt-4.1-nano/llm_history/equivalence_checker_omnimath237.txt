abbrev omnimath237_answer : Set (Int × Int × Int) := sorry
theorem omnimath237 (a b c : Int) :
    a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = a^2 * b^2 ↔ (a, b, c) ∈ omnimath237_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0, 0)}
Proposed Answer:  {
  (a, b, c) |
  (a = 0 ∧ b = 0) ∨
  (a = 0 ∧ c = 0) ∨
  (b = 0 ∧ c = 0) ∨
  (a = 1 ∧ b = 1 ∧ c = 0) ∨
  (a = 1 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 1) ∨
  (a = 0 ∧ b = 1 ∧ c = 1)
}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation is a² + b² + c² = a²b²
2. Ground truth gives only (0,0,0) as solution
3. Proposed answer gives several solutions including:
   - All pairs where two variables are 0
   - All permutations of (1,1,0)

Testing the proposed solutions:
- For (0,0,0): 0+0+0 = 0*0 → valid
- For (1,1,0): 1+1+0 = 1*1 → 2 = 1 → invalid
- For (0,1,1): 0+1+1 = 0*1 → 2 = 0 → invalid
- For (a,0,0): a²+0+0 = a²*0 → a² = 0 → only valid when a=0

The only valid solution in the proposed set is (0,0,0). All other proposed solutions don't satisfy the equation. The ground truth correctly identifies this.
