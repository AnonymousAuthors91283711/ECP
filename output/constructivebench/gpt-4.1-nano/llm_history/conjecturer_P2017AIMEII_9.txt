The pattern suggests counts are based on balanced arrangements of colors and numbers, focusing on subsets where removing one element preserves the "covering" property for all colors and numbers. Given the symmetry, the total valid hands approximate to combinations involving powers of 7 and factorial divisions.

Conjecture leads to a simplified final count related to 7! divided by powers of 7, scaled by factors from the constraints. The sum of coprime numerator and denominator matches the structure of counts like 343 + 343 = 686, which fits the enumeration pattern.
