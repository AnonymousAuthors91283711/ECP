Because \( N \) is divisible by 792, and \( N \equiv 2 \pmod{10} \), analyze the conditions modulo 8, 99, and 10 for patterns in \( A, B, C \). From the enumerations, the answer set corresponds to digit triplets satisfying specific congruences; the pattern suggests the only such triplet is when \( A \equiv 0 \pmod{10} \), \( B \equiv 0 \pmod{10} \), and \( C \equiv 2 \pmod{10} \).

The key points are:  
- \(N \equiv 2 \pmod{10}\) implies \(2 = (A*10^6 + B*10^5 + C*10^4 + \dots + 2) \equiv 2 \pmod{10}\), so \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are digits 0 to 9.  
- \(N\) divisible by 792 means \(N \equiv 0 \pmod{8}\) and \(N \equiv 0 \pmod{99}\).  
- Since \(N\) ends in 2, \(N \equiv 2 \pmod{10}\), which is incompatible with divisibility by 8 unless the pattern is specific. But the critical point is the congruences.  
- From the enumeration, only certain triplets satisfy divisibility: it seems that only when \(A=0, B=0, C=2\), the divisibility holds, which matches the provided pattern.  

In Lean, to express the set of triplets satisfying these conditions, use a predicate matching these digits explicitly.  

Conjecture: The only such triplet is \((0,0,2)\). Thus, the set is a singleton containing this coordinate triple.  

Because `Fin 10` is a finite set of digits, and the answer set is a set of triplets, the set can be expressed explicitly or as a singleton set<bool>.  

Final answer (corrected in Lean syntax) expressing the singleton set with the triplet \(\boxed{(0,0,2)}\) :

Given the problem context and the enumeration hints, the set of triplets (A, B, C) that satisfy the divisibility condition is a singleton set containing exactly (0, 0, 2). The key reasoning factors are:

- When N ends with digit 2, N ≡ 2 mod 10, which conflicts with divisibility by 8 unless specific digits are chosen.
- The pattern from enumeration suggests only the triplet (0, 0, 2) satisfies N divisible by 792.

Thus, the set can be expressed explicitly as a singleton containing just this triplet.

The correct Lean syntax for such a singleton subset of `Fin 10 × Fin 10 × Fin 10` is:

The main goal is to define a singleton set containing the triplet `(0, 0, 2)` as an element of `Set (Fin 10 × Fin 10 × Fin 10)`. In Lean, a singleton set can be constructed using set literals `{ ... }`. Since `Fin 10` types can be constructed with explicit numeral notation, `(0 : Fin 10)` is valid.

Therefore, the corrected answer should be: 

```lean
<<< {(a, b, c) | a = 0 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 2} >>

The main issue is that the answer expression is directly inserted after the abbreviation declaration without using the syntax `def` or defining it as a `Set` explicitly. Also, in Lean, to define a set with a comprehension, you should use `Set.filter` or set-builder notation properly, and do not enclose it with `<<< >>>`.

Given the pattern in the enumerated answers, the consistent simple set describing the unique triplet (0, 0, 2) would be:

`{(a, b, c) | a = 0 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 2}`

which is Lean syntax for set-builder notation.

Therefore, the corrected answer should be:

```lean
abbrev omnimath2007_answer : Set (Fin 10 × Fin 10 × Fin 10) := {(a, b, c) | a = 0 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 2}
```

and it must not be wrapped in `<<< >>>`. 

**Conclusion:** The finalized answer is:

<<< { (a, b, c) | a = 0 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 2 } >>>

This expression is close to the enumerated pattern, minimal, and consistent with Lean arithmetic set notation.
