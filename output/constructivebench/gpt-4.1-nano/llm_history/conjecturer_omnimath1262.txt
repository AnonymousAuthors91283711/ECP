Since the absolute value inequality involves a quadratic in x, we analyze the quadratic expression \( x^2 + 2ax + 3a \). Its discriminant determines where the inequality holds, leading to conditions on a for a unique x satisfying the inequality. Based on this pattern, the answer set relates to points where the quadratic has a single notable solution, i.e., when the discriminant is zero.

Thus, the answer set is the singleton where \( a = -1/3 \), corresponding to the quadratic having a perfect square form.
