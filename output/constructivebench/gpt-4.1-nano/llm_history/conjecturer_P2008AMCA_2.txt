noncomputable abbrev P2008AMCA_2_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2008AMCA_2 :
  1 / (1 / 2 + 2 / 3) = P2008AMCA_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The expression 1 / (1 / 2 + 2 / 3) simplifies algebraically to 6. Therefore, the answer should be the constant real number 6.  
Final answer:  
<<<6>>>
