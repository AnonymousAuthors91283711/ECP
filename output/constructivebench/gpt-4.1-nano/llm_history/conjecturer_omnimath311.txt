The pattern suggests the largest set size with the property that any two functions differ in at least 2 positions, preventing overlaps in only one position. Since each pair differs in at least 2 places, the maximum size is achieved when the set contains all functions with limited overlaps. The total possible functions: 10^6. The maximum n where the condition holds is _ (size of the largest such set). Given the constraints, the largest size is 10.
