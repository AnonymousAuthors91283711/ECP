The roots r, s, t satisfy the relations from the elementary symmetric sums. Since the polynomial is monic, Vieta's formulas give r + s + t = -a, rs + rt + st = b, and rst = -c. The expression (rs)^2 + (st)^2 + (rt)^2 is symmetric and can be expressed in terms of symmetric sums using identities. Specifically, (rs)^2 + (st)^2 + (rt)^2 = (rs + st + rt)^2 - 2r s t(r + s + t).  Substituting, this simplifies to b^2 - 2(-c)(-a) = b^2 - 2a c. 
Therefore, the answer is:

The current proposed answer `b^2 - 2 * a * c` is invalid because in the definition of `omnimath419_answer`, the parameters (a, b, c) are unnamed and unused, resulting in unresolved identifiers `a`, `b`, and `c`. To fix this, I need to explicitly parameterize `omnimath419_answer` as a function from three ℚ arguments, and then define it as a function of those arguments, not as a standalone expression.

Looking at the pattern and the problem context, the expression `(r * s)^2 + (s * t)^2 + (r * t)^2` relates to the symmetric sums of roots, specifically those of a cubic polynomial with roots r, s, t, expressed as coefficients a, b, c in the polynomial:

\[ (X - r)(X - s)(X - t) = X^3 + a X^2 + b X + c \]

From symmetric polynomial identities, the sum of squares of pairwise products equals:

\[ (r s)^2 + (s t)^2 + (r t)^2 = (r^2 + s^2 + t^2)^2 - 2(r^2 s^2 + s^2 t^2 + r^2 t^2) \]

which can be expressed in terms of the elementary symmetric sums:

\[ \begin{cases}
r + s + t = -a \\
r s + s t + r t = b \\
r s t = -c
\end{cases} \]

Using identities:

\[
r^2 + s^2 + t^2 = (r + s + t)^2 - 2(r s + s t + r t) = (-a)^2 - 2b = a^2 - 2b
\]

and

\[
r^2 s^2 + s^2 t^2 + r^2 t^2 = (r s + s t + r t)^2 - 2 r s t (r + s + t) = b^2 - 2(-c)(-a) = b^2 - 2 a c
\]

Putting it all together:

\[
(r s)^2 + (s t)^2 + (r t)^2 = (a^2 - 2b)^2 - 2(b^2 - 2 a c) = (a^2 - 2b)^2 - 2b^2 + 4 a c
\]

But simplifying directly, the key is that the sum reduces to:

\[
(r s)^2 + (s t)^2 + (r t)^2 = a^2 - 2b
\]

which can be checked via standard symmetric identities in roots.

Therefore, the answer (the closed form for the sum in terms of a, b, c) is \( a^2 - 2b \).

I will write this as a function of the parameters, fixing the errors.

Final answer: the function that takes a, b, c and outputs `a^2 - 2 * b`.
