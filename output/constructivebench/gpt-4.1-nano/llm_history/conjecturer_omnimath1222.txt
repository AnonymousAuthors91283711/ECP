The pattern suggests finding the maximum s for which there exist non-negative a,b,c,d,e satisfying the combination sum. The sum 15^3=3375 is partitioned into weights 625, 250, 100, 40, 16. To maximize s, choose the minimal counts for larger weights and maximally utilize smaller weights, which minimizes the total counts and thus maximizes s. Equivalently, maximize the number of units e, then fill remaining sum with other variables, reaching a maximum total count when using the smallest weight for remaining parts. The minimal total count s occurs with minimal combinations for the larger weights, leading to an upper bound that simplifies to the sum of units. The maximum s occurs when the sum is achieved by the largest possible e, then minimizing other variables.

The largest number of e is obtained when other variables are zero:

- 16e = 3375 → e = 3375/16, which is not an integer.
- Consider small necessary adjustments to reach a valid integer e, then optimize by distributing remaining sum among other variables.

Given the pattern, the maximum s is achieved when the minimal counts are employed for weights 625, 250, and 100, with e as high as possible.

Calculating the total count s with all remaining sum assigned to e:

E.g.,

- Use the largest e satisfying 16e ≤ 3375, i.e., e = 210 (since 16*210=3360), leaving 15 for other weights:

Remaining sum = 3375 - 3360=15, which cannot be split into remaining weights, so the maximum e is 210 with small residual.

Adding minimal counts for the remaining residual 15, possibly using c=0, b=0, a=0. The total sum for s is then:

s = a + b + c + d + e

Minimize variables for larger weights; e is maximal.

Thus, the maximum total sum s is approximately e + 0 (other variables), hence:

s = 210 + 0.

But since the problem asks for the greatest possible sum s over the set, and considering the pattern in enumerated answers, the maximum s is 16 (from minimal residuals and the smallest weights).

**Final reasoning:**

The maximal sum s corresponds to the harmonic mean calculation: sum of quotient parts dividing total sum:

\[ s = \frac{15^3}{16} = \frac{3375}{16} \]

which is not an integer; the largest integer less than this is 210.

Pattern suggests the answer is:

**Answer:** 16.

But for the exact form, the simplified closed form is:

\[ s = \lfloor 15^3 / 16 \rfloor \]

so,

The crucial insight is to determine the maximum total number of units \( s = a + b + c + d + e \), given the total sum \(625a + 250b + 100c + 40d + 16e = 3375\) (since \(15^3 = 3375\)).

By greedily choosing the largest number of smallest units (i.e., maximizing \( e \)), we have:

\[
16 e \leq 3375 \implies e \leq \left\lfloor \frac{3375}{16} \right\rfloor = 210
\]

which yields:

\[
16 \times 210 = 3360
\]

Remaining sum:

\[
3375 - 3360 = 15
\]

which cannot be achieved solely with the other weights, but these could be zero for them. Since decreasing \( e \) slightly below 210 will increase the residual sum, but reduce total \( s \). The maximum total \( s \) occurs at \( e = 210 \) with the remaining sum not assigned to other weights, resulting in:

\[
a = b = c = d = 0, \quad e=210
\]

and total sum:

\[
s = a + b + c + d + e = 210
\]

This achieves the greatest total count \( s \), and the total sum is maximized given the constraints.

In formal Lean expression, expressing this maximum as an exact closed-form numerator over denominator:

\[
\frac{15^3}{16}
\]

which is approximately 210.9375, the integer part being 210.

**Final answer:**

<<< (15^3) / 16 >>>
