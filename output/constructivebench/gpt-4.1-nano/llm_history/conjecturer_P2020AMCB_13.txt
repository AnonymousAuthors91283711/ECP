  P2020AMCB_13_answer = sqrt (log 3 / log 2) + sqrt (log 2 / log 3) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The expression involves symmetric terms of the form √(log 3 / log 2) and its reciprocal √(log 2 / log 3). These are inverses under multiplication, summing to a constant behavior. Simplify to a closed form of \( \sqrt{\frac{\log 3}{\log 2}} + \sqrt{\frac{\log 2}{\log 3}} \).

<<<(sqrt (log 3 / log 2) + sqrt (log 2 / log 3))>>>
