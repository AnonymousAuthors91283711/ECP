Ground Truth Answer: 2017
Proposed Answer: 4^6 + 2*4^5 + 4^4 + 2*4^3 + 4^2 + 2*4 + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the sum of a list where each element is d * 4^p, with d and p coming from parallel lists [1,0,2,0,1,2,1] and [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] respectively.

2. The ground truth answer is 2017.

3. The proposed answer expands the sum explicitly: 
   4^6 + 2*4^5 + 4^4 + 2*4^3 + 4^2 + 2*4 + 1

Let's verify if the proposed answer matches the problem:
- The exponents correspond to the p values in reverse order (6 to 0)
- The coefficients correspond to the d values in reverse order (1,2,1,2,1,0,1)

However, the original d values are [1,0,2,0,1,2,1], which when reversed would be [1,2,1,0,2,0,1]. The proposed answer's coefficients don't match this exactly (it has 2 in the wrong places).

Calculating the proposed answer:
4^6 = 4096
2*4^5 = 2048
4^4 = 256
2*4^3 = 128
4^2 = 16
2*4 = 8
1 = 1
Total = 4096+2048+256+128+16+8+1 = 6553 ≠ 2017

The correct expansion should be:
1*4^6 + 2*4^5 + 1*4^4 + 0*4^3 + 2*4^2 + 0*4^1 + 1*4^0
= 4096 + 2048 + 256 + 0 + 32 + 0 + 1 = 6433 ≠ 2017

Neither matches 2017, and the proposed answer's coefficients are incorrect.

<<<False>>>
