The minimal t occurs when the differences between f’s values are non-zero and the values are among {arcsin, arccos, arctan} of sin t, cos t, tan t. Since these are critical points of inverse trig functions, the solution occurs at t = π/4 where sin t = cos t = √2/2 and tan t = 1. These values allow the functions to take on exactly two distinct outputs with minimal positive t.
