theorem omnimath2464 :
  (∫ t in Icc 0 2, (if t ≤ 0.25 then 50 else if t ≤ 0.5 then 50 - 60*(t - 0.25) else 0) * (1/2)) = omnimath2464_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The integrand forms a piecewise linear function with trapezoidal segments over [0,0.25], [0.25,0.5], [0.5,2]. Integral sums these areas; computing yields a quadratic in the parameters. The first segment has area 25, the second segment reduces linearly to 10, and the third is zero. Summing areas: 25 + (average height of second segment) * width = 25 + (50 + 0)/2 * 0.25 = 25 + 12.5 = 37.5. Multiplied by 1/2 yields 18.75. 

Final answer: <<<37.5>>>
