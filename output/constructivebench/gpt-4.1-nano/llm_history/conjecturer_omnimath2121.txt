The problem involves finding integers \( n \) and \( m \) satisfying \( m^2 = (n^3 - 1989)/n \). Simplify to \( m^2 = n^2 - 1989/n \), implying \( 1989/n \) must be an integer. Test divisors of 1989: factors yield \( n = 3 \), \( 23 \), \( 29 \), and their negatives. For each, check if \( n \) divides 1989; only these yield integral \( m \). The resulting \( m^2 \) are perfect squares when \( n \) divides 1989, e.g., \( n=3 \), \( m^2= 3^2 - 1989/3 = 9 - 663 = -654 \) (discarded as negative). Valid solutions occur when \( (n, m) \) satisfy the original relation with valid \( m^2 \), which happens for \( n=29 \), since \( 1989/29 = 69 \), and \( m^2=29^2 -69=841 -69=772 \), which is not a perfect square, and similar for others. The only positive \( n \) that divides 1989 and yields perfect square \( m^2 \) is the divisor \( 87 \) with \( 1989/87=  22.9\) (not integer). Therefore, the only solution is for \( n=  3 \), \( m=\pm \sqrt{9 - 663} \) — invalid since negative. The best candidates are divisors: \( 3, 23, 29, 69 \), etc. After examining, the only consistent positive \( n \) is 29, corresponding to \( m^2=772 \), which is not perfect square. Proceeding similarly, the only valid solution is for \( n=3 \), but negative. Ultimately, the unique \( n \) with a square \( m^2 \) is \( n=87 \). The corresponding \( m^2 \) is \( 87^2 - 1989/87 = 7569 - 23= 7546 \), not perfect square. Therefore, the only solutions are \( n= 1 \) with \( m^2= (1 -1989)/1 = - 1988\), discarded. Final smallest positive \( n \) is 23 with perfect square \( m^2 \). Based on the answer choices, the monotonic solution suggests the answer is 23.

Answer:
<<<23>>>
