Ground Truth Answer: {(3, 2, 6)}
Proposed Answer: {(2, 2, 3)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all triples (p, q, r) of positive integers where:
   - p and q are prime numbers
   - r > 0
   - (r² - 5q²)/(p² - 1) = 2

2. Ground Truth Answer: {(3, 2, 6)}
   - Check: p=3 (prime), q=2 (prime), r=6
   - Calculation: (6² - 5*2²)/(3² - 1) = (36 - 20)/(9 - 1) = 16/8 = 2 ✔

3. Proposed Answer: {(2, 2, 3)}
   - Check: p=2 (prime), q=2 (prime), r=3
   - Calculation: (3² - 5*2²)/(2² - 1) = (9 - 20)/(4 - 1) = (-11)/3 ≈ -3.666 ≠ 2 ✖

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the given equation, while the ground truth does. They are not equivalent.
