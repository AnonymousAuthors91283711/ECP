Given the functional equation and the enumerated pattern, the solution suggests a form involving powers of x, with parameters a and b. The consistent pattern in enumerated answers indicates the final expression is \(ab \cdot x^{a-1}\). Setting consistent parameters, the closed form simplifies to \( \lambda a b x, a \cdot b \cdot x^{a - 1} \).
