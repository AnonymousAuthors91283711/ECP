The sums ∑_{i=1}^4 (|i - k| + |i - n|) and ∑_{i=1}^4 (|i - n| + |i - k|) are equal for all k, so the condition reduces to finding the maximum of k in [1,4].

By symmetry, the maximum k satisfying the set condition is n if n ∈ [1,4], which is always within the bounds.

Hence, the answer is the maximum of {1, 2, 3, 4} ∩ [1,4], which is 4.
