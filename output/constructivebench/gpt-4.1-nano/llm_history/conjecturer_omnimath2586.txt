Given the problem's focus on functions `f : Fin 9 → Fin 9` satisfying `f^[5] x = x`, the functions are permutations where every element has order dividing 5. The cycle structures must therefore be composed of cycles of length dividing 5, constrained to cycles of length 1 or 5 because 5 is prime. The total permutations are products of disjoint cycles, with possible cycle type combinations of fixed points and 5-cycles, summing to 9. Enumerating options:

- All fixed points (identity): 1
- One 5-cycle and 4 fixed points: `C(9,5) * 4!`
- Two 5-cycles impossible since total length exceeds 9
- Other combinations are invalid

Thus, total count = 1 + `C(9,5)*4!` = 1 + 126 * 24 = 3025

Expressed in Lean: 

<<<1 + Nat.choose 9 5 * 4!>>>
