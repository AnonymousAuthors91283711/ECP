The pattern suggests the answer set involves real numbers where the floor functions satisfy certain equalities. Since the expression reduces to the case when \( x \in \mathbb{Z} \), the final set contains exactly the integers.

The requested set should be all real numbers \(x\) satisfying the equivalence involving floor functions. The problem states that for such \(x\), the expression \(\lfloor x^2 - 2x \rfloor + 2 \lfloor x \rfloor = \lfloor x \rfloor^2\) holds. 

The error in the current proposed answer is due to incorrect syntax for defining a set comprehension in Lean. In Lean, the syntax for set comprehension is `{ x | condition }`, where `condition` is a propositional expression. To include \(x \in \mathbb{R}\) explicitly, note that `x` is already of type `ℝ`, so that part is redundant.

The enumerated answers and the structure of the problem suggest that \(x\) can be any real number, because the set was initially expressed with `Set.range (λ k : ℤ, ↑k)`, i.e., the integers. Also, the key points suggest that the solution tends to be in the integers or related to integers, but more generally, those \(x\) for which the floor functions relate in a way that the formula holds are likely to be the integers and possibly extend further.

Given the context, the most natural and simple candidate for the answer set, consistent with the pattern, is the set of all integers, i.e.,

\[
\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x \in \operatorname{range} (\lambda k : \mathbb{Z}, \uparrow k) \}
\]

which can be written in Lean as:

```lean
{ x | ∃ k : ℤ, x = ↑k }
```

or equivalently:

```lean
set.range (λ k : ℤ, ↑k)
```

So, the correct syntax should be:

```lean
{ x | ∃ k : ℤ, x = ↑k }
```

thereby avoiding syntax errors and expressing the set correctly.

**Final answer:**

<<<set.range (λ k : ℤ, ↑k)>>
