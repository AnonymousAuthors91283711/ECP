Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (-1)^(ceil (n / 2 : ℚ) - 1) * 2 * ceil (n / 2 : ℚ)
Proposed Answer: fun n => (n - 1) * (n + 1) * (2 * n - 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the determinant of a special matrix defined by counting solutions to a Diophantine equation.

2. The ground truth answer involves:
   - A sign term (-1)^(ceil(n/2)-1)
   - A linear term in ceil(n/2)
   - This suggests an oscillating pattern with linear growth

3. The proposed answer is a cubic polynomial in n:
   - (n-1)(n+1)(2n-1) = 2n³ - n² - 2n + 1
   - This grows much faster than the ground truth answer
   - Doesn't match the oscillating pattern

The two answers are clearly different in both form and growth rate. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth.
