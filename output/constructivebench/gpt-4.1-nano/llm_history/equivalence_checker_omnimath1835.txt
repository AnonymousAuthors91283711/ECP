Ground Truth Answer: { -2, -1, 1, 2 }
Proposed Answer: {1, 2}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer {1, 2} is partially correct as it includes the positive exponents where solutions exist (Fermat's Last Theorem holds for n=1,2 but not higher positive integers). However, it's missing the negative exponents {-2, -1} where solutions also exist (e.g., for n=-1, 1/2 + 1/2 = 1/1). The ground truth answer { -2, -1, 1, 2 } is complete.
