The problem specifies that the digits of n (between 1000 and 9999) must all be even, effectively constraining n's thousands, hundreds, tens, and units digits to 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. Since the first digit n/1000 must be nonzero (between 1 and 9), the only even options are 2, 4, 6, 8. The remaining three digits can be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. The total count is 4 (for the first digit) times 5^3 (for the remaining digits). The sum of all such n is found by summing over each fixed hundreds digit and summing over choices for the last three digits, considering the position values. To find a closed form, sum all n = 1000 * a + 100 * b + 10 * c + d where a ∈ {2,4,6,8}, b,c,d ∈ {0,2,4,6,8}.

Sum over a: sum_{a ∈ {2,4,6,8}} 1000a  
Sum over b,c,d: sum_{each digit} (100b +10c + d) over all choices, given the uniform distribution. 

Thus, the total sum is:

`(sum_{a} 1000 a) * 5^3 + (sum_{b,c,d} (100b +10c + d)) * 4`

which simplifies to:

- sum_a ≠ 0 only for even a≥2: 2+4+6+8=20, thus sum over a: 1000*20=20,000
- sum over digit positions b,c,d: each digit varies over {0,2,4,6,8}:
  each digit sum: (0+2+4+6+8)=20; multiplying for each position:

sum_b=20*5^2=20*25=500  
sum_c=500  
sum_d=20=20

Total sum over remaining digits: 100*500+10*500+20=50000+5000+20=55,020

Total answer = first sum + remaining digits sum:
= 20,000 * 125 + 55,020 * 4

Calculating final:

20,000 * 125=2,500,000  
55,020*4=220,080

Final total sum:

2,500,000 + 220,080= <<<2502080>>>
