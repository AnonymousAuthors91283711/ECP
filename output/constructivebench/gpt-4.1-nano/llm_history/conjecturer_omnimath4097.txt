The expression simplifies to the value of \( y \) corresponding to the minimal sum when \( a = b = c = 1 \), since substituting these positive values evenly satisfies the sum and minimizes the contributions of the negative cubes. Thus, the minimal \( y \) occurs at \( a = b = c = 1 \), resulting in three identical terms each equal to 1.

The core idea in the problem involves analyzing the set of values y that are attained by the function A over positive real numbers a, b, c satisfying the sum constraint a + b + c = 3. The function A is defined as:

A a b c := (2 - a³) / a + (2 - b³) / b + (2 - c³) / c.

Given the symmetry and positivity constraints, the extremum (minimum or maximum) of A occurs at symmetric points, often at equal values for a, b, c due to symmetry. 

The proposed answer appears to be the value of A at the symmetric point where a = b = c = 1, since that simplifies calculations:

A 1 1 1 = (2 - 1³)/1 + (2 - 1³)/1 + (2 - 1³)/1 = (2 - 1) + (2 - 1) + (2 - 1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

The prior error arises because defining `omnimath4097_answer` as a constant directly causes an issue regarding noncomputable definitions involving real numbers and division. To fix this, we should mark the constant as `noncomputable`.

The generalized form of the answer is the symmetric value at this point, which is 3, corresponding to the equal point a = b = c = 1, given the symmetry and positivity constraints, and the sum constraint a + b + c = 3.

Therefore, the corrected Lean code should be:

<<<noncomputable def omnimath4097_answer : ℝ := 3>>>

Explanations:
- Marked as `noncomputable` to bypass Lean's restrictions on computations involving division and real numbers.
- The value 3 is obtained at the symmetric point a = b = c = 1.
- This is consistent with the symmetry and the sum constraint, making it a plausible extremum candidate in the set defined.
- The proof would involve showing this value is the least over that set, potentially involving optimization techniques, but the question only asks for the answer definition.

Thus, the answer in Lean becomes:

The goal is to identify the minimum value of the function \(A(a, b, c) = \frac{2 - a^3}{a} + \frac{2 - b^3}{b} + \frac{2 - c^3}{c}\) subject to the constraints \(a, b, c > 0\) and \(a + b + c = 3\). The symmetry of the problem suggests the extremum occurs at symmetric points, i.e., where \(a = b = c\).

Let's analyze the function at the symmetric point \(a = b = c = 1\):
\[
A(1,1,1) = 3 \times \left(\frac{2 - 1}{1}\right) = 3 \times 1 = 3.
\]
Since the cubic term grow rapidly and the function involves fractions decreasing as \(a, b, c\) grow, this candidate seems plausible as the minimum point.

Given the problem's symmetry and the constraints, the minimal value of \(A\) on the specified domain is \(3\). The problem asks for a least value, which in Lean can be expressed as a constant number \(3\). The theorem indicates \(A\) attains this minimum at the symmetric point.

In Lean, the answer should be a simple real number, not a noncomputable or mismatched declaration.

**Final answer:**
<<<3>>>

**Explanation:**  
The symmetric point \(a = b = c = 1\) satisfies the constraints and yields \(A=3\). Due to symmetry and the behavior of the function, this is the minimum value of \(A\) over the domain. The proposed answer is thus the constant real number 3.
