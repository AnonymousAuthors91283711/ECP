Ground Truth Answer: 112
Proposed Answer: 58
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves logarithmic terms with exponents of a and b, and establishes a relationship between term1, term2, and term3.

2. The key is to recognize that the condition term2 - term1 = term3 - term2 implies an arithmetic sequence in the exponents.

3. From term1 = 3log(a) + 7log(b) and term2 = 5log(a) + 12log(b), we get d = term2 - term1 = 2log(a) + 5log(b).

4. The arithmetic sequence seq k = term1 + (k-1)*d would give:
   seq 12 = term1 + 11d = (3log(a) + 7log(b)) + 11*(2log(a) + 5log(b)) = 25log(a) + 62log(b)

5. This should equal log(b^n) for some n, meaning 25log(a) must be 0 (which isn't generally true unless a=1, but the problem doesn't specify this).

6. The ground truth answer (112) comes from considering only the coefficient of log(b), which would be correct if we ignore the log(a) terms (perhaps implied by some unstated condition).

7. The proposed answer (58) is incorrect as it doesn't match either the full calculation (62) or the ground truth (112).
