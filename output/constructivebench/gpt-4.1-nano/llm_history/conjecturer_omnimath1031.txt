theorem omnimath1031 : 
  (∑ n ∈ (Finset.range 51).filter (fun n => 2 ≤ n ∧ Nat.gcd n 50 = 1), phi_factorial n) % 50 = omnimath1031_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sum involves numbers coprime to 50, specifically those with gcd n 50 = 1, within 2 ≤ n ≤ 50. The pattern suggests the sum of phi factorials mod 50 simplifies to 0 because coprime counts and factorial products balance out over the range.
