Ground Truth Answer: 4375
Proposed Answer: (31622 - 377 + 1)
Let me analyze this:

1. The problem is asking for the count of numbers between 10^6 and 10^9 that are divisible by 7 and are perfect squares.

2. The ground truth answer is 4375.

3. The proposed answer is (31622 - 377 + 1). Let's compute this:
   - 31622 is approximately √10^9 (since 31622^2 = 999,950,884)
   - 377 is approximately √10^6 (since 377^2 = 142,129)
   - So (31622 - 377 + 1) = 31246, which is the count of all perfect squares between 10^6 and 10^9

4. The proposed answer is missing the divisibility by 7 condition. It only counts perfect squares, not those divisible by 7.
