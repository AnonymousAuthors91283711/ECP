Because the conditions imply that both remainders are zero, the algebraic analysis suggests a symmetric relation involving specific proportionalities between a and b. The pattern indicates that (a,b) satisfy a proportional relation with ratios involving quadratic forms. The likely closed form is the set of pairs (a,b) with a = b or with specific ratios such as a = 1 and b = 1, which satisfy the divisibility conditions. Based on the pattern, the explicit solutions generalize to the set where a = b or a = 1 and b = 1.
