Given the functional equation and positivity constraint, the solutions resemble affine functions of the form f y = y * c with c > 0, and the functional equation points toward a linear structure. The positive solutions appear to be scalar multiples of the identity function.

The main goal is to specify the set of functions satisfying the functional equation and positivity conditions. The reasoning suggests the solutions are linear functions of the form f y = c * y with c > 0, as this allows the functional equation to hold. The proposal should be a set of such functions expressed via a property involving an existential quantifier (∃ c > 0, ∀ y > 0, f y = c * y).

The previous attempt was a prose explanation included in the abbrev, which caused errors because Lean expects a formal set expression, not textual commentary.

Final fix: define omnimath4082_answer as the set of all functions from ℝ to ℝ for which there exists a positive scalar c such that for all y > 0, f y = c * y.
