The sum of binomial coefficients from 0 to n equals 2^n, and simplifies modulo a prime p based on Lucas theorem. Specifically, for p=2017, which is prime, the sum modulo 2017 reflects the behavior of powers modulo p. Since 2014 ≡ -3 mod 2017, and small binomial sums relate to powers, the sum reduces to (2^{2014} mod 2017), which equals 2^{-3} mod 2017, i.e., the inverse of 8 mod 2017. The inverse of 8 mod 2017 is 226, given 8 * 226 ≡ 1 mod 2017. So, the sum mod 2017 is 226.
