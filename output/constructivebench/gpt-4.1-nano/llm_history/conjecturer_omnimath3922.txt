  (∃ (m : Fin 15 → ℤ), ∑ k : Fin 15, (m k : ℝ) * arctan (k.1 + 1) = arctan 16) ↔ omnimath3922_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Prop
Given the sum involves a telescoping pattern of arctan additions: arctan(1)+arctan(2)+...+arctan(14)=arctan(16). The sum is achieved with a sequence m(k) that telescopes to 16, so the potential m(k) are ±1 to cancel for each pair. The sum's form suggests the total sum equals arctan(16), achievable with m(k) = 1 for all k, which sums telescoping upward to arctan(16).
