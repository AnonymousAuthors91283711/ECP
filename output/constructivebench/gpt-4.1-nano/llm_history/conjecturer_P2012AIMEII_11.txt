The function, iterated many times, converges toward a fixed point satisfying f₁(x) = x - 3, which simplifies to a linear relation, and the final answer depends on coprimality and sum constraints. Based on the pattern and the enumerated hints, the sum of numerator and denominator aligns with the total shifts involved, leading to the simplest coprime pair summing to 10.

<<<(1, 9)>>>

This pair (m, n) satisfies m + n = 10, coprimality, and relates to fixed points shifted by -3 over multiple iterations.
