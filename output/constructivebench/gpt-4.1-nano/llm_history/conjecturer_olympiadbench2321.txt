The pattern indicates m has three digits, all different, with last digit equal to the product of the first two. Since the digits are distinct, and last digit equals product of the first two, the possibilities are limited: the first two digits are from 1 to 9, and the last digit is (first digit) * (second digit) mod 10, which must be a single digit (0-9). Solutions occur when the product is a single digit between 0 and 9, and last digit equals that product. Checking such cases yields numbers: 134, 152, 231, 264, 315, 436, 538, 672, 741, 852, 963, considering only numbers with distinct digits and last digit equal to the product of the first two digits.

Given that, the only number satisfying the conditions is 264, where digits 2, 6, 4: 4 = 2 * 2, but 6 ≠ 2*4, so discard. Next, 435: digits 4, 3, 5: 5=3*1.66, discard. Another candidate: 672: 2*6=12 (last digit 2), 12 mod 10=2, last digit matches. The digits: 6, 7, 2: 2=7*6=42 mod 10=2, last digit 2 matches. Are digits distinct? Yes: 6,7,2. Last digit matches product of first two: 6*7=42, mod 10=2, last digit 2, matches. Digits are all different. Therefore, the number is 672. It seems the unique such number is 672.

Answer: 672

<<<672>>>
