Given the pattern of the enumerated answers, the key is to recognize that the set's infinitude depends on how the divisors grow. Since n*(a + n * k) can be structured to produce many divisors depending on k, the property hinges on whether k divides certain values. The pattern suggests k's divisibility influences the infinite set condition. Conjecture: the property holds if and only if k divides a fixed number, likely 2018, due to the problem's structure.

Final answer:

<<<fun k : ℕ => 2018 ∣ k>>>
