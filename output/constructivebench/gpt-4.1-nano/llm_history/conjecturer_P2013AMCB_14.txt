  P2013AMCB_14_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sequences resemble Fibonacci with different initial conditions. The minimal N occurs when all initial parameters are 1, maximizing the difference in the sequences' values at step 6.

Thus, the minimal N is the 6th Fibonacci number with initial (a₁,a₂) = (1,1) and (b₁,b₂) = (2,1), giving N=13.

Final answer: <<<13>>>
