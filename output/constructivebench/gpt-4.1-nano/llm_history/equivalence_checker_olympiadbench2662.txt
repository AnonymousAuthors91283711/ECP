Ground Truth Answer: 70
Proposed Answer: 20 * 7
Let's analyze this problem step by step:

1. The problem asks for the smallest positive natural number N that satisfies:
   - 14 divides 20*N (14 ∣ 20*N)
   - 20 divides 14*N (20 ∣ 14*N)

2. The ground truth answer is 70.

3. The proposed answer is 20 * 7, which equals 140.

4. Checking the conditions:
   - For N=70:
     - 20*70 = 1400, which is divisible by 14 (1400/14=100)
     - 14*70 = 980, which is divisible by 20 (980/20=49)
   - For N=140:
     - 20*140 = 2800, divisible by 14 (2800/14=200)
     - 14*140 = 1960, divisible by 20 (1960/20=98)

5. While 140 satisfies the conditions, it's not the least such number (70 is smaller and also satisfies them).

The proposed answer gives a correct solution but not the minimal one, so the answers are not equivalent.
