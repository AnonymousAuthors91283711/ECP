Given the problem's conditions, the minimal k satisfying the statement appears to be related to the number of points needed to ensure the existence of pairs with either very small (less than 1/n) or very large (greater than n) differences.

The enumerated answer pattern suggests a pattern close to 2n + 1, as it balances the need for points that can produce both small and large differences.

Thus, the conjectured minimal k is 2 * n + 1.
