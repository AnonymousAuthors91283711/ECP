Ground Truth Answer: 1024 / 255
Proposed Answer:  (8 * 2^7) / (2^8 - 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the average size of non-empty subsets of a set with 8 elements.

2. Ground Truth Answer: 1024/255
   - 255 = 2^8 - 1 (number of non-empty subsets)
   - 1024 = 8 * 2^7 (total size of all non-empty subsets)

3. Proposed Answer: (8 * 2^7)/(2^8 - 1)
   - This is exactly the same as the ground truth answer, just written in exponential form
   - 8 * 2^7 = 8 * 128 = 1024
   - 2^8 - 1 = 256 - 1 = 255

The two answers are mathematically identical, just expressed in different forms.
