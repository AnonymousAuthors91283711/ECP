Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 4
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the first non-zero digit in the reversed decimal representation of 20 × (13 factorial).

2. The ground truth answer is 6, meaning when you write 20 × 13! in decimal, reverse its digits, the first non-zero digit you encounter is 6.

3. The proposed answer is 4, which would mean the first non-zero digit in the reversed representation is 4.

4. To verify, let's consider the actual computation:
   - 13! = 6227020800
   - 20 × 13! = 124540416000
   - Reversed digits: 000614045421
   - The first non-zero digit is indeed 6 (from the left in the reversed string).

The proposed answer (4) is incorrect as it doesn't match the actual computation. The correct first non-zero digit in the reversed representation is 6.

<<<False>>>
