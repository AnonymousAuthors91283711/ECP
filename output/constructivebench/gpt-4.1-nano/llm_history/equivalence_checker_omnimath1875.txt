theorem omnimath1875 :

    if p = 0 then c < 360 else c * 10^(digits 10 p).length + p < 360) 
    (Finset.product (Finset.range 60) (Finset.range 60))

Ground Truth Answer: 153 / 1180
Proposed Answer: (23 / 36 : ℚ)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting valid pairs (c,p) where:
   - If p=0, then c < 360
   - Else, c*10^(digits of p) + p < 360
   - c and p are both in range 0-59 (since Finset.range 60)

2. The ground truth answer is 153/1180 ≈ 0.12966
3. The proposed answer is 23/36 ≈ 0.63888

The proposed answer is significantly larger than the ground truth answer. The ratio between them is about 4.9x, which suggests they're fundamentally different solutions.

Looking at the problem:
- The total possible pairs is 60*60 = 3600
- The ground truth suggests 153 valid pairs (153/3600 = 153/1180 is incorrect, but 153/3600 ≈ 0.0425)
- Wait, there seems to be a discrepancy in the ground truth denominator (1180 vs 3600)

However, even with this, the proposed answer 23/36 is clearly much larger than what we'd expect for this counting problem. The valid pairs should be a small fraction of the total, not a majority.
