The problem models a watch set to 12:00, with a correction factor, resulting in the displayed time reaching 22 at a certain true time t. The correction is linear, so the true time t when display shows 22 can be found by reversing the correction: t = (actualTime - 12) * (60 / 57.6) + 12. This simplifies to t = (actualTime - 12) * (25 / 24) + 12. For actualTime = 22, t = (22 - 12) * 25/24 + 12 = 10 * 25/24 + 12 = (250/24) + 12 = (125/12) + 12.

In decimally simplified form: 125/12 + 12 = 125/12 + 144/12 = 269/12.

Thus, the solution is the true time, which is 269/12. 

<<<269/12>>>
