The problem involves a permutation over a finite set with specific neighbor constraints. The allowed mappings are each element to itself or an adjacent element, with no repetitions ensuring the permutation’s distinctness. This is equivalent to counting permutations with constraints involving neighboring swaps, which match the Fibonacci sequence pattern.

Hence, the total count corresponds to Fibonacci number F₁₁ (since n=10 and the sequence starts with F₁=1, F₂=1). Therefore, the answer is F₁₁ = 89.
