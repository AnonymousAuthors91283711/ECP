First observe the symmetry constraints on a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i and their relations, implying that the key variable g is constrained by products involving these variables. Noticing the pattern and symmetrical relations, and based on the enumeration, the consistent value that satisfies all the equations is 1. Since the equations involve product equalities, the minimal positive solution common to all, considering constraints, is 1.

The main error in the candidate answer is that it is a prose explanation rather than an actual Lean expression. The goal is to produce a closed-form numerical answer that aligns with the problem constraints: the symmetrical relations imposed by the equations suggest that the key variable g, which is bounded by these relations, should be 1, given the minimal positive solutions that satisfy all the product equalities.

Based on the enumeration and symmetry, the consistent minimum positive value satisfying the symmetry and equations is 1. Encapsulating this as a lean expression in a clean, closed form yields simply 1.
