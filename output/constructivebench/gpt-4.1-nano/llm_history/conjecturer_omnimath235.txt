theorem omnimath235 (n : ℕ) (h : 0 < n) :
  (let total_matches := (3 * n * (3 * n - 1)) / 2
   let girls_matches := n * (n - 1) / 2 + 2 * n * n
   let boys_matches := total_matches - girls_matches
   boys_matches = 7/5 * girls_matches) ↔ n ∈ omnimath235_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Let's analyze the counts: total matches involve n girls and boys; girls matches = (n*(n-1))/2 + 2n², boys matches = total - girls matches, and ratio is 7/5. The algebra simplifies to n satisfying a quadratic condition; solving yields n such that (a quadratic expression) is integer. Pattern from enumerations suggests n=5, 10, 20,... In closed form, these are: powers of 2 times 5. Final formula: n = 5 * 2^k for k ≥ 0. 

Thus,

<<<{n | ∃ k : ℕ, n = 5 * 2^k}>>>
