The minimal value of the sum of squares is attained when the expressions inside are closest to zero. By analyzing the given expression, the minimum occurs when the pairs of linear combinations are orthogonal or aligned optimally, leading to the minimal sum at a specific constant value.

Answer: <<<0>>>
