      k' + 1 = omnimath3195_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern indicates the value of `k + 1` is independent of `c`. For `c` in [5,10], the equations have consistent solutions, and the value of `k + 1` is fixed. Assuming the solution for `k + 1` remains constant across the range, the answer is the common value deduced.

Examining the enumeration pattern, the constant value is 21.
