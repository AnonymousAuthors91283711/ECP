Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℤ | n ≥ 0}
Proposed Answer: {n : ℤ | 1 ≤ n}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer {n : ℤ | 1 ≤ n} is mostly correct but misses the case when n=0. The ground truth includes n=0, and indeed for n=0, the inequality becomes 3 ≥ 3 which holds true. The proposed answer excludes n=0, making it incomplete. Therefore, the answers are not fully equivalent, but the proposed answer is correct for all n ≥ 1.
