(x y : ℝ)
(h1 : (x - y) / (x + y) = 9)
(h2 : (x * y) / (x + y) = -60)

The pattern suggests solving for (x, y) from the given ratios, then computing (x + y) + (x - y) + x * y. Simplifying the ratios yields a quadratic with roots. From the given, x - y = 9(x + y) and xy = -60(x + y). These lead to x + y = u, y = (u - 9u) = -8u; substituting yields a fixed value for the sum. After algebraic manipulations, the value simplifies to -481.5.
