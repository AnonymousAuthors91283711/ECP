Ground Truth Answer: 38
Proposed Answer: 20
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us an equation: 20*previousGames + 36 = 21*(previousGames + 1)
2. We can solve for previousGames:
   20x + 36 = 21x + 21
   36 - 21 = 21x - 20x
   15 = x
   So previousGames = 15

3. Now we need to find nextPoints such that:
   20*previousGames + 36 + nextPoints = 22*(previousGames + 2)
   Plugging in previousGames = 15:
   20*15 + 36 + nextPoints = 22*17
   300 + 36 + nextPoints = 374
   nextPoints = 374 - 336 = 38

The ground truth answer is indeed 38, while the proposed answer is 20. These are clearly different numbers.
