The pattern indicates the number x is a 4-digit number with repeated digits a and b, where a ≠ 0, and x = n² + 1. The structure suggests x is of the form 1100a + 11b, with a ≠ 0, and x - 1 is a perfect square between 1000 and 9999.

Squares between 1001 (= 32² + 1) and 9999 (= 99² + 1) are relevant, with x-1 = n², so x spans from 1001 to 9999.

Considering the pattern, the only candidates occur when x-1 is a perfect square in this range, with last digit matching the form 1100a + 11b + 1, which leads to a = 1, and b such that 1100 + 11b + 1 = m².

Thus, the only x satisfying the form and being among these squares would correspond to specific values for a and b.

Therefore, the only such x with these properties is x = 1089 (which is 33² + 1, 33² = 1089).

Final answer: The value is 1089.
