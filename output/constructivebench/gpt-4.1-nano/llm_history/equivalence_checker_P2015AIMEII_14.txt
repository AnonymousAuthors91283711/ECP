Ground Truth Answer: 89
Proposed Answer: 30
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a system of two equations with variables x and y, and asks for the value of a specific expression involving x and y.

2. The ground truth answer is 89, which comes from a known competition problem (2015 AIME II Problem 14).

3. The proposed answer is 30, which is significantly different from the ground truth.

4. The equations are symmetric in x and y, suggesting the solution might involve symmetric expressions or substitutions. The correct solution would need to satisfy both given equations and yield the correct expression value.

5. The proposed answer of 30 doesn't match the known correct answer of 89, and there's no indication that this could be a simplified or partial answer.
