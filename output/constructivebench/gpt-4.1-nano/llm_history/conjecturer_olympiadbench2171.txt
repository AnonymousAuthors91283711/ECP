The pattern suggests that functions satisfying the functional equation are quadratic functions. Solving the relation indicates that f(x) = x^2 plus possibly an additive constant. Consistent with similar classic equations, the unique solutions are quadratic functions of the form f(x) = x^2. Therefore, the set of solutions is the singleton containing only this quadratic function.

The error occurs because in Lean, set notation with braces { ... } expects a predicate of the form fun f => ... , rather than a list of functions. Thus, to define `olympiadbench2171_answer` as the set of functions f satisfying a condition, it should be written as a set of functions (a predicate). 

The proposed answer attempts to define a singleton set containing the particular function λ x, x^2, but uses `{fun f : ℚ → ℚ => f = (λ x, x^2)}`, which is correct in idea, but Lean interprets this as a set with one element explicitly specified using braces, which is valid if the set is constructed properly. The mistake here is in the syntax or in how the set is formed.

To fix the error, one approach is to define `olympiadbench2171_answer` as the set of functions `f` with the property that `f = (λ x, x^2)`. The simplest correction is to write:

`set (ℚ → ℚ) := {f | f = (λ x, x^2)}`.

Alternatively, to match the syntax in the code, define `olympiadbench2171_answer` as a set containing exactly `λ x, x^2`. In Lean, this can be written as:

`{ λ x, x^2 }`.

Thus:

```lean
abbrev olympiadbench2171_answer : Set (ℚ → ℚ) := { λ x, x^2 }
```

or

```lean
abbreviation olympiadbench2171_answer : Set (ℚ → ℚ) := { f | f = (λ x, x^2) }
```

Given the initial code, the simplest fix is:

- Replace `{fun f : ℚ → ℚ => f = (λ x, x^2)}` with `{ λ x, x^2 }`. 

**Final corrected code:**

```lean
abbrev olympiadbench2171_answer : Set (ℚ → ℚ) := { λ x, x^2 }
```

This defines the set containing exactly the function `λ x, x^2`, which is the expected answer.  

**Summary:**

- The main issue was the syntax of set definition.
- By writing `{ λ x, x^2 }`, we define the singleton set containing the parabola `x^2`.

Hence, the fixed final answer expression is:

The error stems from using curly braces `{ }` with a lambda expression, which is syntactically incorrect in Lean for defining a set. In Lean, singleton sets should be written with `({ ... })`, so the corrected expression should be `({ λ x, x^2 })`. Additionally, since the overall goal is to define a set of functions, a set containing a single function, the proper syntax is to use the singleton set notation with parentheses.

Considering the problem, the solution is likely the singleton set containing the quadratic function `λ x, x^2`. This fits the pattern implied by the proposed answer and the typical solutions for such functional equations.

Therefore, the fixed answer is:

<<<({ λ x, x^2 })>>>

This adjustment should resolve the syntax error without changing the intended set.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error occurs because in Lean, when defining a set of functions with a singleton set literal, the correct syntax is `({ λ x, ... })` with parentheses containing the lambda, but the issue is that `{}` is used for sets, and in your code there's an extra comma leading to syntax confusion. Also, `Set (ℚ → ℚ)` expects a set of functions, but the set notation should be: `({ λ x, ... })`.  
The provided answer `{ λ x, x^2 }` is a singleton set of a lambda function, so the correct syntax omits the comma after `x^2`.  

Conjecture: Based on the functional equation and typical quadratic solutions, the set of solutions appears to be all functions of the form \(f(x) = x^2\). Given the pattern and the goal, the proper formal set would be `({ λ x, x^2 })`.
