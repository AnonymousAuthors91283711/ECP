Ground Truth Answer: 25
Proposed Answer: 5
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n ≥ 2 where 2^(2^n) mod (2^n - 1) is not a power of 4.

2. The ground truth answer is 25, which means that for n=25, 2^(2^25) mod (2^25 - 1) is not a power of 4.

3. The proposed answer is 5, which would mean the condition fails at n=5.

4. Let's test n=5:
   - 2^5 - 1 = 31
   - 2^(2^5) = 2^32
   - 2^32 mod 31 = 1 (since 2^5 ≡ 1 mod 31, so 2^30 ≡ 1 mod 31, and 2^32 ≡ 4 mod 31)
   - 4 is a power of 4 (4^1), so n=5 doesn't satisfy the condition.

5. The proposed answer is incorrect because n=5 does satisfy the condition (the result is a power of 4). The ground truth answer 25 is correct as it's the smallest number where this fails.
