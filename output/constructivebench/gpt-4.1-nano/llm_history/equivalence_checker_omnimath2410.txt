Ground Truth Answer: 83/80
Proposed Answer: 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives trigonometric relationships between angles A, B, C and sides AB, AC, BC of a triangle.

2. From h₁ and h₂, we can see they are essentially the same relationship (just reciprocals), establishing that sin B / sin C = AC / AB.

3. The ground truth answer is a specific fraction (83/80 ≈ 1.0375), while the proposed answer is simply 1.

4. The expression (sin²B + sin²C - sin²A)/(sin B sin C) would generally not simplify to 1 for arbitrary triangles, and the given conditions don't suggest such a simplification would occur.

5. The ground truth answer suggests there's a specific configuration where this ratio equals 83/80, which is different from 1.

Since the proposed answer (1) differs significantly from the ground truth answer (83/80) and there's no indication that they should be equal under the given conditions, we conclude:

<<<False>>>
