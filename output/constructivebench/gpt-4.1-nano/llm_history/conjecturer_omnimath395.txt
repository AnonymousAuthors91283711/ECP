Given the quadratic roots and differences, the solutions relate to the quadratic discriminant and the square root structure. The roots are \( x_{1,2} = \frac{m \pm \sqrt{m^2 + 32}}{4} \), and their difference is \(\frac{\sqrt{m^2 + 32}}{2}\). Equating \(\left|x_1 - x_2\right| = m - 1\), yields \( | \sqrt{m^2 + 32} | = 2(m - 1) \implies m^2 + 32 = 4(m - 1)^2 \). Solving yields \( m \in \{ 3, -3 \} \).
