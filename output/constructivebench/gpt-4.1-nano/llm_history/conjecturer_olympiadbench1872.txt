The pattern in the enumerated answers suggests a function involving powers of 2 and a quadratic term. Considering the inequality with roots and the structure, the critical point occurs at x=1, simplifying to a bound involving N=2^n. The form likely reflects the minimal a satisfying the inequality for all x.  
Conjecture: \(a \geq \frac{1}{2^{n}}\). 

Final answer: <<<fun n : ℕ => 1 / 2^n>>>
