The pattern in enumeration suggests the answer relates to the multiplicity of (X - 1) dividing q, which equals (p - 1)/2 for prime p ≥ 3. This reflects quadratic residues modulo p. Hence, the maximum n with (X - 1)^n dividing q is (p - 1)/2.

Current Proposed Answer: The pattern in enumeration suggests the answer relates to the multiplicity of (X - 1) dividing q, which equals (p - 1)/2 for prime p ≥ 3. This reflects quadratic residues modulo p. Hence, the maximum n with (X - 1)^n dividing q is (p - 1)/2.

The main issue in the provided Lean code is the use of a natural language comment or explanation directly within the abbreviation definition, which is invalid syntax. To fix this, I will remove the explanatory text and replace it with a valid Lean definition that encapsulates the pattern implied by the enumeration: that the multiplicity of (X - 1) dividing q is (p - 1)/2 when p is an odd prime.

Given the problem's context, the pattern indicates that for prime p ≥ 3, the multiplicity (degree n) where (X - 1)^n divides q in the polynomial q = ∑_{k=1}^{p-1} Polynomial.C(k^{(p-1)/2}) * X^k is exactly (p - 1)/2. Since q encodes quadratic residues modulo p, the multiplicity aligns with the number of quadratic residues, which is (p - 1)/2.

Therefore, the function's formula in Lean should be:

```lean
fun p : ℕ => (p - 1) / 2
```

and it should be enclosed in the delimiters as requested.

Also, note that we should be aware of p ≥ 3 to avoid issues when p is small; but for the purpose here, the formula generalizes under the assumption p ≥ 3 with p odd and prime.

Final Answer:

<<<fun p : ℕ => (p - 1) / 2>>>
