theorem omnimath3095 : 
  ∀ (players : Finset ℕ) (h : players.card = 5), 
    3 * (players.card.choose 2) = omnimath3095_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests calculating 3 times the number of pairs in a 5-player group, i.e., 3 * (5 choose 2) = 3 * 10 = 30. The pattern matches the enumeration. 

<<<30>>>
