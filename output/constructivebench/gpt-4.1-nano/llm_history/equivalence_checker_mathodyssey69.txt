Ground Truth Answer: (√6 - √2) / 2
Proposed Answer: √(2 - √3)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer √(2 - √3) and the ground truth answer (√6 - √2)/2.

First, let's square both expressions to compare them more easily:

1. Ground truth squared: [(√6 - √2)/2]² = (6 + 2 - 2√12)/4 = (8 - 4√3)/4 = 2 - √3
2. Proposed answer squared: [√(2 - √3)]² = 2 - √3

The squares are identical, which means the expressions are either equal or negatives of each other. Since we're dealing with norms (which are non-negative) and square roots (which we take as principal roots), both expressions are positive.

Therefore, the proposed answer √(2 - √3) is indeed equivalent to the ground truth answer (√6 - √2)/2.
