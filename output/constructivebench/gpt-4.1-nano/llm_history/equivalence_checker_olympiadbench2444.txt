Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 12
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a function N(t,a) = a / 2^(t/6)
2. We have initial conditions A0 = 2*B0 and N(24,A0) = N(24,B0)
3. We need to find t where N(t,B0) = B0/2

Calculating:
N(t,B0) = B0 / 2^(t/6) = B0/2
=> 2^(t/6) = 2
=> t/6 = 1
=> t = 6

But wait, let's check the initial condition:
N(24,A0) = A0 / 2^(24/6) = A0 / 2^4 = A0/16
N(24,B0) = B0 / 2^4 = B0/16
Given A0 = 2B0, then A0/16 = 2B0/16 = B0/8
But the condition says N(24,A0) = N(24,B0), so B0/8 = B0/16
This implies B0 = 0, which would make the problem trivial.

This suggests there might be an error in interpreting the problem. The ground truth answer is 8, while proposed is 12. Neither matches our calculation of 6, but since the ground truth is given as 8, we should trust that.

The proposed answer (12) doesn't match the ground truth (8), so:

<<<False>>>
