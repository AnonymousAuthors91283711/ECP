theorem IMO2013SLN1 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ m n : ℕ, m^2 + f n ∣ m * f m + n) ↔ f = IMO2013SLN1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Given the divisibility condition, the pattern suggests that f behaves like the identity function or a similar linear function satisfying the divisibility constraints. This commonly reduces to f(n) = n for all n.  

Answer: <<<fun n : ℕ => n>>>
