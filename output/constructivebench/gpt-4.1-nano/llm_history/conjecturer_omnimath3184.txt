The pattern indicates that M n is related to the supremum of binomial coefficients with increasing n, approaching a limit involving binomial coefficients of the form chosen (n-1). Since the limit involves ratio of M n over n, which likely tends to 2^n / n, the expression suggests tending to 2. To match the pattern and eliminate existential quantifiers, I conjecture the answer is 2.
