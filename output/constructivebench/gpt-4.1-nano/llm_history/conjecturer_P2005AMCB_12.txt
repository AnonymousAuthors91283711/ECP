The problem relates the roots of two quadratics and their roots scaled by 2. Observing the pattern, the roots \( r, s \) satisfy the second quadratic with roots \( 2r, 2s \). This implies the coefficients are related via the root sum and product. Recognizing properties of scaled roots, the ratio \( n/p \) is a fixed rational number; the pattern suggests it simplifies to 4.
