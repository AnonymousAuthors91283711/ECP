Ground Truth Answer: fun n => choose n 2
Proposed Answer: fun n => (n * (n - 1)) / 2
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The ground truth answer uses the binomial coefficient "choose n 2" which calculates the number of ways to choose 2 elements from n elements. The proposed answer "(n * (n - 1)) / 2" is exactly equal to "choose n 2" since:
choose n 2 = n! / (2! * (n-2)!) = (n * (n-1)) / 2

Both expressions represent the same mathematical quantity - the number of possible pairs (2-element subsets) from a set of size n. Therefore, the answers are equivalent.
