The pattern suggests the answer involves powers and quadratic expressions. The values are derived from (2, 2^2 - 5, (2^2 - 5)^2 - 5). Calculating explicitly: y = 4 - 5 = -1, z = (-1)^2 - 5 = 1 - 5 = -4. Recognizing a pattern, the sequence resembles the quadratic form n^2 - 5 with n starting at 2 and 2^2. For general n, the value is n^2 - 5. With n=2, \(2^2 - 5 = -1\). The sequence for z involves iterating this quadratic. The pattern suggests the explicit formula for z is \( (n^2 - 5)^2 - 5 \). Here, n=2 yields the value. Final answer: 

<<<(2^2 - 5)^2 - 5>>>
