    Finset.card (Finset.filter (fun d => d ∣ 128 ∧ IsSquare d ∧ d > 1) (Finset.range 129)) = omnimath2759_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the enumeration, the divisors of 128 less than or equal to 128, that are perfect squares and greater than 1, are {4, 16, 64, 128}. Since 128 is not a perfect square, exclude 128. The remaining are 4, 16, 64, which are perfect squares. The number of such divisors is 3. 

Final answer: <<<3>>>
