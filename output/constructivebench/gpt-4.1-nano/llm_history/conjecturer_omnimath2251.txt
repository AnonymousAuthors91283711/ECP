Since the system of equations is linear and symmetric in y and z, and given the sum, derive explicit expressions for variables: x, y, z. Solving yields x = 7, y = 6, z = 6 to satisfy the equations. 

The pattern suggests a fixed solution set involving the unique solution to the linear system. 

Final answer:

<<<{(x, y, z) | x = 7 ∧ y = 6 ∧ z = 6}>>>
