Because the condition involves equality of sums of cubic functions and the product of pairs, and based on pattern analysis, solutions are symmetric with respect to the roots of f and their relations, leading to the set of points where a function involving roots and symmetries holds.  
The closed-form involves the solutions to quadratic equations derived from the original conditions.  
Thus, the answer set simplifies to the roots of the quadratic x^2 - x/2 = 0, namely 0 or 1/2.  
Hence, the set is {0, 1/2}.
