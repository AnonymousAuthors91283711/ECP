Based on pattern and polynomial structure, the sum of squares of roots resembles the sum of elementary symmetric polynomials related to coefficients. Specifically, the sum of roots squared relates to coefficient of the polynomial and the roots' multiplicative properties. Using Vieta's formulas, the sum of roots squared equals sum of roots squared minus the sum of roots times roots, leading to: 

<<<-14>>>

This aligns with the coefficient for the \(X^4\) term, suggesting the sum of squares of roots is \(-14\).
