Given the constraints, the quadratic function f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c must satisfy f(1)=16, f(0)=y, and dominate both (x+3)^2 and x^2+9 everywhere. To be the least such y, choose the minimal parabola with leading coefficient a ≥ 1, and minimal crossing points with the bounds. Solving for minimal y yields y = 7, when the parabola touches (x + 3)^2 at x=-3.
