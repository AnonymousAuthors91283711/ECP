theorem olympiadbench2857 (T : ℕ) :
  let k := T + 1
  let total := k * (k - 1)^4
  let at_most_two_colors := k + k * (k - 1) * ((k - 1)^3 - (k - 2)^3)

Ground Truth Answer: fun T => (T + 1) * T^4 - (T + 1) * T - (T + 1) * choose T 2 * (2 * T^3 - 3 * T^2 + T)
Proposed Answer: fun T : ℕ => T^4 + 2*T^3 + T^2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines:
   - k = T + 1
   - total = k * (k-1)^4 = (T+1)*T^4
   - at_most_two_colors = k + k*(k-1)*((k-1)^3 - (k-2)^3) = (T+1) + (T+1)*T*(T^3 - (T-1)^3)

2. The ground truth answer expands this correctly to:
   (T+1)*T^4 - [(T+1)*T + (T+1)*T*(T-1)/2*(2T^3-3T^2+T)]

3. The proposed answer is a simple polynomial: T^4 + 2T^3 + T^2

Comparing these:
- The ground truth answer correctly represents the complex combinatorial expression from the problem statement
- The proposed answer is a much simpler polynomial that doesn't match the complexity of the ground truth
- The proposed answer doesn't account for the combinatorial terms (choose T 2) or the more complex polynomial subtraction
