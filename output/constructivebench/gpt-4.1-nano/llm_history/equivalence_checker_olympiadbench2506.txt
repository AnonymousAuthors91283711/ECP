Ground Truth Answer: 7 / 5
Proposed Answer: (41 / 29) - (12 / 29) / (2 ^ 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives a recurrence relation for a sequence aₙ and a specific value a₂ = 41/29, asking us to find a₀.

2. The ground truth answer is 7/5 (which equals 1.4).

3. The proposed answer is (41/29) - (12/29)/2 = (41/29) - (6/29) = 35/29 ≈ 1.2069.

4. Let's verify the ground truth:
   - If a₀ = 7/5, then:
     a₁ = 1 + 1/(1 + 7/5) = 1 + 5/12 = 17/12
     a₂ = 1 + 1/(1 + 17/12) = 1 + 12/29 = 41/29 (matches given condition)
   - The ground truth is correct.

5. The proposed answer (35/29) doesn't equal 7/5 (since 35/29 ≈ 1.2069 ≠ 1.4).
