  IsGreatest {z : ℝ | ∃ x' y', |x' + y'| + |x' - y'| = 2 ∧ z = x'^2 - 6*x' + y'^2} (P2011AMCA_18_answer x y) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
Based on the pattern and common forms for quadratic expressions involving sums/differences under such constraints, the answer likely simplifies to a quadratic form involving the given variables. The pattern suggests an expression centered at x and y, with symmetrical quadratic terms.

Therefore, the closed-form answer that matches the pattern is:  
<<<fun x y => (x - 3)^2 + y^2>>>
