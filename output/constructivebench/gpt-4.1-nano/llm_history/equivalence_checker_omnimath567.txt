Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n * (n + 1) / 2
Proposed Answer: fun n => n * n - n
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest number k of pairs (i,j) where i,j ≤ n that can form a set where:
   - There exists a unique injective function f mapping each i ≤ n to some j (i.e., a unique perfect matching)
   - The number of such pairs is maximized

2. The ground truth answer is n*(n+1)/2, which is the sum of the first n natural numbers.

3. The proposed answer is n² - n.

Let's compare these for small values of n:
- For n=1:
  - Ground truth: 1*(1+1)/2 = 1
  - Proposed: 1² - 1 = 0 (incorrect, should be 1)
- For n=2:
  - Ground truth: 2*3/2 = 3
  - Proposed: 4 - 2 = 2 (incorrect)
- For n=3:
  - Ground truth: 3*4/2 = 6
  - Proposed: 9 - 3 = 6 (matches)
- For n=4:
  - Ground truth: 4*5/2 = 10
  - Proposed: 16 - 4 = 12 (incorrect)

The proposed answer only matches at n=0 and n=3, but fails for other values. The pattern suggests it's not equivalent to the ground truth.
