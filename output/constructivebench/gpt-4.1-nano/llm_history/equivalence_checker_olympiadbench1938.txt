Ground Truth Answer: {fun x : ℤ => -1, fun x : ℤ => x + 1}
Proposed Answer: {f : ℤ → ℤ | ∃ c : ℤ, ∀ x : ℤ, f x = x + c}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all functions f: ℤ → ℤ satisfying the functional equation:
   f(x - f(y)) = f(f(x)) - f(y) - 1 for all x, y ∈ ℤ

2. The ground truth answer provides two specific solutions:
   - The constant function f(x) = -1
   - The linear function f(x) = x + 1

3. The proposed answer suggests that all solutions are linear functions of the form f(x) = x + c for some constant c ∈ ℤ.

Analysis:
- The constant function f(x) = -1 is indeed a solution (plugging in verifies this).
- The linear function f(x) = x + 1 is also a solution.
- However, not all linear functions f(x) = x + c satisfy the equation. For example:
  - f(x) = x + 0 doesn't work (try x=y=0 gives f(-f(0))=f(f(0))-f(0)-1 ⇒ 0 = 0-0-1 ⇒ -1=0, false)
  - Only c=1 works for linear functions

The proposed answer incorrectly claims that all linear functions of form x + c are solutions, when in fact only c=1 works (plus the constant function f(x)=-1).
