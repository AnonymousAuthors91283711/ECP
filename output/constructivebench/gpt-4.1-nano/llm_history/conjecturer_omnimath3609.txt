Given P.degree = n and P.eval at integers k in [0, n] equals k / (k + 1), the pattern suggests a telescoping sum structure, leading to the value at n+1 being n/(n+1). 

Thus, the closed form for the answer is the rational number n / (n + 1). 

Final answer (lean expression):
<<<fun n => n / (n + 1)>>>
