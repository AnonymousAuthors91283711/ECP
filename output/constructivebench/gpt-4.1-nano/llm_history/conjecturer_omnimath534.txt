Given the conditions: \( n \) between 10,000 and 99,999, palindromic digits, divisible by 99, and minimal, the minimal such number is 10001, which is not divisible by 99. The next candidate is 10101, which is palindromic and divisible by 99. The pattern suggests that the smallest 5-digit palindrome divisible by 99 is \( 10001 \). Checking divisibility, 10001 mod 99 ≠ 0; next candidate is 10201, checking divisibility yields false. Continuing with 10301, 10401, etc., 10801, etc. The candidate is 10801, which is divisible by 99? Let's verify:

10801 / 99 ≈ 109 (since 99 * 109 = 10791), so 10801 - 10791 = 10, not divisible.

Moving forward, 10901, 11011, 11111, etc.

In particular, palindromic and divisible by 99 is 10001? No, as checked. The next likely candidate is 10989:

10989 / 99 ≈ 111, 111 * 99 = 10989 exactly. Perfect!

And 10989 is a 5-digit number?

Yes. Is 10989 a palindrome? digits: 1 0 9 8 9, reverse digit sequence: 9 8 9 0 1, not the same. So discard.

Next candidate: 11011 - contains 0 in middle, palindrome? Yes, 1 1 0 1 1, reverse same: 1 1 0 1 1, is a palindrome.

Check divisibility: 11011 / 99? 99 * 111 = 10989, 11011 - 10989 = 22, so no.

Next candidate: 11111, reverse same, palindrome, check divisibility: 11111 / 99? 99 * 112 = 11088, subtract: 113, not divisible.

Number: 11211

Check: 11211 / 99? 99 * 113 = 112 owned. 99*113 = 11211 exactly! Yes! 11211 is divisible by 99, is a palindrome, in range, and greater than 10000.

Therefore, the minimal number satisfying all conditions is 11211. 

Final Lean expression:

<<<11211>>>
