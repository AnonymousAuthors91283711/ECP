Ground Truth Answer: 10
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

The problem presents an equation:
(4*16 + 6*N)/(10*(16 + N)) = 58/100

Let's solve it step by step:

1. Simplify numerator: 4*16 + 6*N = 64 + 6N
2. Simplify denominator: 10*(16 + N) = 160 + 10N
3. Equation becomes: (64 + 6N)/(160 + 10N) = 58/100
4. Cross multiply: 100(64 + 6N) = 58(160 + 10N)
5. Expand: 6400 + 600N = 9280 + 580N
6. Subtract 580N from both sides: 6400 + 20N = 9280
7. Subtract 6400: 20N = 2880
8. Divide by 20: N = 144

Wait, this contradicts both answers. Let me recheck the calculation:

Original equation: (64 + 6N)/(160 + 10N) = 0.58
Cross multiply: 64 + 6N = 0.58(160 + 10N)
64 + 6N = 92.8 + 5.8N
6N - 5.8N = 92.8 - 64
0.2N = 28.8
N = 144

The correct solution is N=144, which doesn't match either the ground truth (10) or proposed answer (8). However, the ground truth is marked as 10 and proposed as 8. Since neither matches the correct solution, but the ground truth is what's officially accepted, we should compare the proposed answer to the ground truth.
