The final answer must be the minimal \(n > 1\) such that \(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2}{n} = k^2\) for some \(k\). The sum of squares is \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\). Dividing by \(n\), the expression simplifies to \(\frac{(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\). For this to be a perfect square, \(\frac{(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\) must be an integer and a perfect square. Checking small \(n\) shows \(n=23\) works with sum \(12744/23=552\) (not a perfect square), then \(n=24\) gives \(1750/24 \not\in \mathbb{Z}\). For \(n=25\), sum is \(\frac{25*26*51}{6}=55250/25=2210\), not a perfect square. The minimal \(n\) satisfying the condition is \(n=49\), with sum \(\frac{49*50*99}{6}=40425\), and \(40425/49=825\), which is a perfect square (\(25^2\)). Thus the minimal \(n\) is 49, and \(k=25\). 

In Lean, expressed as:

<<<49>>>
