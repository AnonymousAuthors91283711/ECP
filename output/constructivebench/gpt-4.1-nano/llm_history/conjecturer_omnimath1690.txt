: IsGreatest {n : ℕ | 2^n ∣ 7^2048 - 1} omnimath1690_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern of divisibility involving powers of 2 dividing expressions like \(7^{2048} - 1\), which relate to the order of 7 modulo powers of 2, the value is close to the highest power of 2 dividing \(7^{2048} - 1\). Since \(7^{2048} - 1\) is divisible by \(2^{11}\), but not \(2^{12}\), the maximal such \(n\) is 11.
