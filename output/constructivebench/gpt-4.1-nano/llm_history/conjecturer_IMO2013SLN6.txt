The error occurs because in Lean, the syntax inside a set comprehension or predicate is expected to be a predicate (a function from the element to Prop), not a lambda followed directly by quantified conditions with commas. Instead, to define a set of functions satisfying a property, we can define the predicate as a lambda with "→ Prop" in the body, or as a set of such functions.

Moreover, the current code combines multiple quantifiers and conditions directly in an ad-hoc lambda expression, which is not syntactically correct. To fix this, we should define an explicit predicate function or write the property as a lambda that forms a predicate.

Given the intended property, the ideal approach is to define `IMO2013SLN6_answer` as the set of functions `f` such that for all `x, a, b`, if `b > 0`, then `f (f x + a / b) = f (-x + a / b)`, and additionally, for all `c, d` in ℤ, if `c > 0`, then `f c + d = 0` and `f (-c) + d = 0`.

Here's the correction: we can write a predicate as a lambda to define the set:

```lean
Abbrev IMO2013SLN6_answer : Set (ℚ → ℤ) := 
  {f | ∀ x a b : ℚ, b > 0 → f (f x + a / b) = f (-x + a / b) ∧
        ∀ c d : ℤ, c > 0 → f c + d = 0 ∧ f (-c) + d = 0}
```

This syntax uses the set notation "{f | ...}" to define all functions `f` satisfying the property, and the property itself is expressed as a predicate involving universal quantifiers.

Final Answer:

<<<{f | ∀ x a b : ℚ, b > 0 → f (f x + a / b) = f (-x + a / b) ∧ ∀ c d : ℤ, c > 0 → f c + d = 0 ∧ f (-c) + d = 0}>>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The main issues are:

1. The incorrect use of "Abbrev" which should be "abbrev".
2. The syntax "abbrev IMO2013SLN6_answer : Set (ℚ → ℤ) := { ... }" is correct, but the subsequent line in the attempted answer seems to have a typo or syntax mistake, possibly residual from editing.

Furthermore, the candidate answer attempts to define the set of functions satisfying the functional equation and an additional property that for integers c > 0, f c + d = 0 and f (-c) + d = 0 for some integer d. The problem is to encode that in Lean properly.

Based on the enumeration pattern, the set of solutions appears to be functions f such that for positive integers c, f c = 0, and for rational inputs, the condition f(f x + a / b) = f(-x + a / b) holds. Likely, the simple explicit form includes functions that equal zero at integers and satisfy the functional equation elsewhere accordingly, possibly with modifications at integers.

I will fix the syntax and generalize the set definition to a closed-form expression consistent with the pattern seen in advanced problem solutions:

- Use "abbrev".
- Define the set of functions as those which are zero at all integers and satisfy the symmetric functional equation for all rational x, a, b with b > 0.

Hence, the final answer:

<<<{
  f | (∀ c : ℤ, c > 0 → f c = 0) ∧ (∀ x a b : ℚ, b > 0 → f (f x + a / b) = f (-x + a / b))
