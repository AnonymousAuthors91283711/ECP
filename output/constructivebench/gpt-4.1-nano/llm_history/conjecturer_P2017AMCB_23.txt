The points form a quadratic pattern, with values at x = 2, 3, 4 and line segments indicating a quadratic around these points. The quadratic passing through (2,4), (3,9), (4,16) suggests f(0) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 by extrapolation. Based on the pattern and quadratic polynomial form, the explicit formula at x=0 is: \(f(0) = 1.\)
