The equation involves a quadratic relation with floor functions. Analyzing the relation \(x^2 + 10000 \lfloor x \rfloor = 10000 x\), the solutions are when \(x\) equals \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) or close values, leading to possible discrete solutions at integer and near-integer points. For each integer \(k\), the equality holds when \(x = k\). The set of solutions corresponds exactly to the integers, so the number of solutions is infinite, but in the context of the problem, assuming finite solutions, the value likely coincides with the count of integers satisfying the equality within the domain.

Based on enumeration, the pattern suggests the total number of solutions is 1, since only one integer solution typically satisfies such a quadratic-floor relation given real constraints.

Thus, the answer is 1.
