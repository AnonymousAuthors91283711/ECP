The pattern suggests the sum of square root expressions symmetrically involving a and b, constrained by the given quadratic relation. Based on the pattern in the enumerations, the value simplifies to a constant independent of a and b satisfying the conditions. This constant is 1, since for positive a, b with 3a² + 2b² = 3a + 2b, the expression reduces to a symmetric form rooted in this relation.
