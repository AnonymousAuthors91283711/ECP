Ground Truth Answer: 15/4
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest value of s = x + y under the constraints:
   - y = x² (a parabola)
   - y - x = 3 - y (which simplifies to 2y - x - 3 = 0)

2. To solve this, we can substitute y = x² into the second equation:
   2x² - x - 3 = 0

3. Solving this quadratic equation:
   x = [1 ± √(1 + 24)]/4 = [1 ± 5]/4
   So x = 3/2 or x = -1

4. For x = 3/2: y = (3/2)² = 9/4 → s = 3/2 + 9/4 = 15/4
   For x = -1: y = (-1)² = 1 → s = -1 + 1 = 0

5. The greatest value is clearly 15/4 (3.75), not 2.

The ground truth answer (15/4) is correct, while the proposed answer (2) is incorrect.
