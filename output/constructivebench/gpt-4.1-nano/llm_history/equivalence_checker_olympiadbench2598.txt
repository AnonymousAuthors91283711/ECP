Ground Truth Answer: 1938
Proposed Answer: 1957
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem states that in 2014, Charlie's age was twice the last two digits of his birth year (which is between 1900-1999).

2. Let's check the ground truth answer (1938):
   - Age in 2014: 2014 - 1938 = 76
   - Last two digits: 38
   - 2 × 38 = 76 (matches the condition)

3. Now check the proposed answer (1957):
   - Age in 2014: 2014 - 1957 = 57
   - Last two digits: 57
   - 2 × 57 = 114 ≠ 57 (doesn't match)

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the given condition, while the ground truth does.

<<<False>>>
