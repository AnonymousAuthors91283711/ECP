Ground Truth Answer: Ioo 5 6
Proposed Answer: {d : ℝ | 5 < d ∧ d < 6}
<<<True>>>
The ground truth answer `Ioo 5 6` and the proposed answer `{d : ℝ | 5 < d ∧ d < 6}` are mathematically equivalent. Both represent the open interval of real numbers between 5 and 6. In Lean, `Ioo 5 6` is simply notation for `{d : ℝ | 5 < d ∧ d < 6}`, so they are exactly the same set. The conditions in the problem statement (¬ (d ≥ 6) ∧ ¬ (d ≤ 5) ∧ ¬ (d ≤ 4)) also correctly describe this interval since they translate to d < 6, d > 5, and d > 4 (though the last condition is redundant as d > 5 already implies d > 4).
