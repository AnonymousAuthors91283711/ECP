Ground Truth Answer: 1000
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find the positive real x that satisfies the equation:
   2^(log(x²)/log10) = 3*2^(1 + logx/log10) + 16

2. The ground truth answer is x = 1000.

3. The proposed answer is x = 8.

Let's test x = 1000:
- log(1000²)/log10 = log(10⁶)/log10 = 6
- 1 + log(1000)/log10 = 1 + 3 = 4
- Left side: 2⁶ = 64
- Right side: 3*2⁴ + 16 = 3*16 + 16 = 64
This checks out.

Now test x = 8:
- log(8²)/log10 = log(64)/log10 ≈ 1.806
- 1 + log(8)/log10 ≈ 1 + 0.903 ≈ 1.903
- Left side: 2^1.806 ≈ 3.48
- Right side: 3*2^1.903 + 16 ≈ 3*3.74 + 16 ≈ 27.22
This doesn't equal the left side.
