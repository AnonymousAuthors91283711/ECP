Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have three equations:
   - x * y = 6
   - x - z = 2 ⇒ z = x - 2
   - x + y + z = 9

2. Substitute z = x - 2 into the third equation:
   x + y + (x - 2) = 9 ⇒ 2x + y = 11 ⇒ y = 11 - 2x

3. Substitute y into the first equation:
   x * (11 - 2x) = 6 ⇒ 11x - 2x² = 6 ⇒ 2x² - 11x + 6 = 0

4. Solve the quadratic equation:
   x = [11 ± √(121 - 48)]/4 = [11 ± √73]/4

5. Now evaluate the expression x/y - z/x - z²/(x*y):
   - After substituting y = 11 - 2x and z = x - 2, and simplifying, the expression always evaluates to 2, regardless of which root we take for x.

The ground truth answer is 2, while the proposed answer is 1. These are clearly different numerical values.
