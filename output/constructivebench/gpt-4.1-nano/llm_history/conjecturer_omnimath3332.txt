theorem omnimath3332 : 
  omnimath3332_answer = List.insertionSort (· ≤ ·) [5^56, 10^51, 17^35, 31^28] := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: List ℝ
The list contains elements with increasing order after sorting. Observing the pattern, the answer list involves prime powers and sums related to the original list. The sorted list's last element is dominant, indicating the maximal value among the given powers.  
Since the sequence is sorted, a plausible closed-form answer is the maximum value in the list, which is 17^35, closed form as the exponential expression related to the pattern seen.  
Suggested simplified, generalized expression: <<<[5^56, 10^51, 17^35, 31^28]>>>
