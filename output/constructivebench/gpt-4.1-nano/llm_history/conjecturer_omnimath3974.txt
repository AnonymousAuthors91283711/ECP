abbrev omnimath3974_answer : Set (ℝ → ℝ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3974 (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
  (∀ x y : ℝ, f (x^2 - y^2) = x * f x - y * f y) ↔ f ∈ omnimath3974_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
Based on the pattern and the functional equation symmetry, the solutions are linear functions satisfying f(x^2 - y^2) = x f x - y f y, which suggests f(x) = c x for some c ∈ ℝ. 

Final answer:

<<<{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ x, f x = c * x}>>>
