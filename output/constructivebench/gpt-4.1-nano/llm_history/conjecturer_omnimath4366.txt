theorem omnimath4366 (x y z : ℕ) (hx : x > 0) (hy : y > 0) (hz : z > 0) :
  (1 + (x : ℚ) / (y + z))^2 + (1 + (y : ℚ) / (z + x))^2 + (1 + (z : ℚ) / (x + y))^2 = 27/4
  ↔ (x, y, z) ∈ omnimath4366_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)
The pattern suggests the symmetric solution with x, y, z proportional to 1, 1, 1 to satisfy the equation. The only positive integers satisfying the relation are (1,1,1).
