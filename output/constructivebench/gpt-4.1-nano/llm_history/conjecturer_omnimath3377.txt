The pattern indicates the ratio involves the roots and their squares, suggesting the polynomial constructed from `(X - r^2)` where `r` are roots of `P`. Since `P` is degree 4 with roots `r_i`, `Q = ∏ (X - r_i^2)`. The expression simplifies to a polynomial related to `P` evaluated at `x`, giving the answer as the polynomial whose roots are the squares of the roots of `P`. Based on pattern:

<<<X^4 + 2*X^3 - 13*X^2 + 14*X - 24>>>
