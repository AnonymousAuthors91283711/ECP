The sum of the first four cubes is \( 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = 1 + 8 + 27 + 64 = 100 \). The pattern of the sum of the first \( n \) cubes is \( \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right)^2 \). For \( n=4 \), this gives \( (4 \cdot 5 / 2)^2 = 10^2 = 100 \).

abbrev omnimath3004_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3004 : 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = omnimath3004_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (n * (n + 1) / 2) ^ 2. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 34, which is at "fun n : ℕ => (n * (n" in "abbrev omnimath3004_answer : ℕ := fun n : ℕ => (n * (n + 1) / 2) ^ 2", there is an error: type mismatch
  fun n => (n * (n + 1) / 2) ^ 2
has type
  (n : ℕ) → ?m.241 n : Type ?u.5
but is expected to have type
  ℕ : Type
Possible Fix: Check if the expected type aligns with the provided type..
. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem is that `abbrev omnimath3004_answer : ℕ := ...` is expecting a value of type ℕ, but the proposed answer `fun n : ℕ => (n * (n + 1) / 2) ^ 2` is a function from ℕ to ℕ, i.e., it has type `ℕ → ℕ`. 

The goal is to write the *value* of the sum \( 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 \), which is a specific concrete number. The summation formula for the sum of the first n cubes is well-known: 

\[
\sum_{k=1}^n k^3 = \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right)^2
\]

Plugging in \(n = 4\):

\[
\sum_{k=1}^4 k^3 = \left( \frac{4 \times 5}{2} \right)^2 = (10)^2 = 100
\]

So, the value of the sum is 100. The missing value is 100. To fix the error, I will set:

```lean
abbrev omnimath3004_answer : ℕ := 100
```

This satisfies the type requirement and accurately provides the sum of the first four cubes.

---

**Final Answer:**

<<<100>>>

**Explanation:** Since the sum \(1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = (4 \times 5 / 2)^2 = 10^2 = 100\), setting `omnimath3004_answer` as 100 resolves the type mismatch and correctly provides the sum value.
