abbrev olympiadbench2510_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2510 :
  let p (x : ℕ) := logb 100 (1 + 1 / x)
  let S := Finset.Icc 81 99
  ∑ x in S, p x = 2 * p olympiadbench2510_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the decreasing nature of p(x) and the sum over a symmetric interval, the sum approximates twice the value at the lower endpoint, suggesting the answer is near 81. The pattern indicates the optimal choice is the lower bound for maximizing the sum.

<<<81>>>
