theorem P2002AIMEII_3 :
  ∃ (a b c : ℕ), a < b ∧ b < c ∧
    b^2 = a * c ∧
    (∃ k : ℕ, b - a = k^2) ∧
    logb 6 a + logb 6 b + logb 6 c = 6 ∧
    a + b + c = P2002AIMEII_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests solutions where a, b, c are related through perfect square differences and sum to specific values. The logs sum to 6, indicating multiplicative relationships between a, b, c, most straightforwardly as powers of 6. The common pattern in enumerated answers (though not shown explicitly here) likely involves choosing a, b, c with certain powers of 6 and the sum matching their pattern, such as using geometric progressions or specific powers. A reasonable closed-form that aligns with the pattern and satisfies logb 6 a + logb 6 b + logb 6 c = 6 is to set a = 6^{x}, b = 6^{x + k^2}, c = 6^{x + 2k^2} for some k, which sum to a fixed total.

Based on the above reasoning, concrete solutions are likely to be linear in powers of 6. The simplest candidate summing to the target with the given constraints, and producing an explicit value, is:

<<<6^3 + 6^4 + 6^5>>>

which sums to a satisfying total, i.e., 6^3 + 6^4 + 6^5 = 6^3 + 6^4 + 6^5.

Final answer:

<<<216 + 1296 + 7776>>>
