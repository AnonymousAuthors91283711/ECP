Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 43, which is at " <<<{(a, b) | b = 1}" in "abbrev omnimath1395_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ) := <<<{(a, b) | b = 1} ∪ {(a, b) | a = 1} ∪ {(a, b) | a = b}>>", there is an error: unexpected token '<<<'; expected term.

The error arises because "'<<{" indicates an attempt at a syntax that is not recognized in Lean. Instead, set notation should be written directly using curly braces, in conjunction with the membership predicate or comprehension syntax for defining sets, e.g., { (a, b) | ... }. 

The given set includes pairs where either a=1, b=1, or a=b, which hints at the solution covering the cases where the divisibility holds, given the structure of the expression a^2017 + b. Since a and b are positive and the set must match the condition of divisibility, the conjectured set pattern seems correct.

To fix the syntax error and define the set properly, I will write the set as:

{ (a, b) | a = 1 ∨ b = 1 ∨ a = b }

This set is inclusive, matching pairs where either a or b is 1 or both are equal.

Final fixed answer:

<<<{ (a, b) | a = 1 ∨ b = 1 ∨ a = b }>>>
