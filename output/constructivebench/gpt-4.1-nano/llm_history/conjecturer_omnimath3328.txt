The pattern suggests the answer relates to the divisors of \(2002^2 - 1\), which factors as \((2002 - 1)(2002 + 1) = 2001 * 2003\). Since the set includes squares minus one, it likely contains all divisors of that product.

open Nat Set

abbrev omnimath3328_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3328 : 
  {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ φ n = 2002^2 - 1} = omnimath3328_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: { n ∈ ℕ | 2001 * 2003 | n }. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 59, which is at " | n }" in "abbrev omnimath3328_answer : Set ℕ := { n ∈ ℕ | 2001 * 2003 | n }", there is an error: unexpected token '|'; expected '}'.

The error occurs because in Lean, the syntax for defining a set using set notation relies on the `Set` constructor and the set comprehension syntax, which uses `⧸` (the `finset.filter`) or `{ x | condition }`. But in Lean, set comprehension is written as `{ n | condition }` where the variable `n` is implicitly introduced. The incorrect part is `" | n }"`, which is not valid syntax since the `|` separator must be preceded by `{` and an explicit variable.

Moreover, the set given, `{ n ∈ ℕ | 2001 * 2003 | n }`, is intended to be the set of natural numbers divisible by 2001 * 2003. In Lean, one way to write this set is using `Set.filter (λ n, 2001 * 2003 ∣ n)` and then coerced into a set. Alternatively, we can write it as `{ n | 2001 * 2003 ∣ n }` directly, which Lean accepts.

Note that our goal is to define `omnimath3328_answer` as the set of all natural numbers divisible by 2001 * 2003, i.e.:

```lean
{ n | 2001 * 2003 ∣ n }
```

This matches the enumerated answer pattern and the intended meaning.

Finally, the theorem states that the set of `n` such that `φ n = 2002^2 - 1` equals this set. Since the prototype has `sorry`, the answer should be the set of all natural numbers divisible by the product 2001 * 2003 (`2012003`), assuming the conditions of the problem.

**Final fixed answer:**

<<<{ n | 2001 * 2003 ∣ n }>>>

**Explanation:**  
This set captures all natural numbers divisible by 2001*2003. The syntax `{ n | condition }` is correct in Lean for set comprehension, and matches the pattern suggested by the enumeration. the original code's `' | n }'` syntax was invalid because it omitted the initial `{ n | ... }` form, and the pipe `|` should be preceded by `{ variable | condition }`. The set of all such divisible numbers correctly models the answer pattern for the problem at hand.
