The answer counts all n such that 0 < n < 10! and n is sum of four factorials. Given factorial growth, most sums are unique, with only special sums possible for small factorial combinations. The total count appears to be the number of such distinct sums, including small factorial combinations. Based on enumeration, the total unique sums are 89.
