theorem mathodyssey82
(f : ℝ → ℝ)
(hfmon : ∀ x y : ℝ, x < y → f x < f y)
(hf : ∀ x : ℝ, x > 0 → f (f x + 2 / x) = -1)
: f 1 = mathodyssey82_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests that the functional equation and monotonicity imply a constant value, likely derived from evaluating at a known point (x=1). The value for f(1) consistent with the pattern in enumerated answers is -1.
