(a b : ℂ)
(hunit : ‖a‖ = 1 ∧ ‖b‖ = 1)
(hab : a * Complex.conjAe b + Complex.conjAe a * b = √3)
: ‖a - b‖ = mathodyssey69_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the symmetry and the conjugate relationship, the inner product condition suggests that a and b are unit complex numbers with an angle of π/6 between them, so their difference norm squared is 2 - 2 cos(π/6) = 2 - √3. Therefore, ||a - b|| = √(2 - √3). 
The answer expression is: <<<√(2 - √3)>>>
