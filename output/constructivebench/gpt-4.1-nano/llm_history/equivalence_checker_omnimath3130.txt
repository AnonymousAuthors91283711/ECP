Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation simplifies to:
1000w + 200x + 30y + 4z = 2014

2. We can divide both sides by 2:
500w + 100x + 15y + 2z = 1007

3. Given the constraints (w:1-9, xyz:0-9), let's find possible values:
- w must be 1 (since 500*2=1000 would exceed RHS)
- Then we have: 100x + 15y + 2z = 507
- x must be 5 (since 100*5=500 is largest possible under 507)
- Then: 15y + 2z = 7
- Only solution is y=0, z=3.5, but z must be integer
- Wait, this suggests no solution exists, which contradicts the problem

4. The ground truth answer is 13, which would correspond to w=1, x=5, y=0, z=7 (sum to 13)
But plugging these in: 1000*1 + 200*5 + 30*0 + 4*7 = 1000+1000+0+28 = 2028 ≠ 2014

5. The proposed answer is 4, which would require w+x+y+z=4
Possible combination w=1,x=1,y=1,z=1 gives:
1000+200+30+4=1234 ≠ 2014

Neither answer seems correct based on the equation. However, the ground truth is likely correct for some interpretation, while the proposed answer is clearly wrong.
