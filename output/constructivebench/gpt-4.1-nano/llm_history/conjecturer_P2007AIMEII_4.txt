abbrev P2007AIMEII_4_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2007AIMEII_4 :
  ∃ (w₁ w₂ : ℕ),   (100 * w₁ = 300 ∧ 100 * w₂ = 200) ∧   (2 * 60 * w₁ = 240 ∧ 2 * 60 * w₂ = 300) ∧   (3 * 50 * w₂ = P2007AIMEII_4_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The constraints imply w₁ = 3, w₂ = 2, and P2007AIMEII_4_answer = 3 * 50 * 2 = 300.  
Final answer matches pattern: <<<300>>>
