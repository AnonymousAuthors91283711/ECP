Based on the pattern of the enumerated solutions and the structure of the problem, the key tuple relationship implies that the minimum of a and b is always 4, since the sums are constrained within an 8x8 grid and related to sums of shifted indices. The difference a ≠ b suggests the minimal value must be exactly 4 for at least one of the sums. 

Thus, the closed form in Set ℕ capturing all such minimal values is:

<<<{4}>>>

which appropriately captures the certain minimal sum when a ≠ b.
