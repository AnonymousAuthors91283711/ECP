Given the identity and the pattern in enumerated answer, the expression seems to be linked to specific forms of trigonometric identities involving multiple angles and symmetric functions. Noticing the pattern's symmetry and common trigonometric manipulations, the simplified closed form appears as a polynomial in m scaled by 2^m.

Hence, the proposed answer is:

<<<fun m : ℤ => (2 : ℝ) ^ m * (m ^ 2 + m + 1)>>>
