Ground Truth Answer: (100, 3)
Proposed Answer: (3, 1)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a unique real number x expressed as a reduced fraction m/n (with m,n coprime) that satisfies a logarithmic equation, and where m+n equals some given value.

2. The logarithmic equation simplifies to:
   log(3^20)/log(2^x) = log(3^2020)/log(2^(x+3))
   Which reduces to:
   20/x = 2020/(x+3)

3. Solving this equation gives x = 3/100.

4. Therefore, the reduced fraction form is m=3, n=100 (coprime since gcd(3,100)=1).

5. The ground truth answer (100,3) would correspond to x=100/3, which is incorrect based on the equation solution.

6. The proposed answer (3,1) would correspond to x=3, which is also incorrect.

Both answers are incorrect, but they are incorrect in different ways. The ground truth answer is closer to being correct (has the right numbers but reversed), while the proposed answer is completely wrong.
