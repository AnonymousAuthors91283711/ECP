The structure of the functional equation resembles that of quadratic functions satisfying certain identities. The max term suggests functions where the equality simplifies for particular polynomial forms, likely constant functions or functions with quadratic behavior. Given the enumeration hint, the set of solutions probably includes constant functions, with only the trivial constant functions satisfying the identity for all real numbers.

Conjecture: The only functions satisfying the properties are the constant functions \(f(x) = c\) where \(c \neq 0\), since \(f(0) \neq 0\).

The set of solutions is then the set of all such constant functions.

The core issue in your provided answer formulation is the incorrect syntax and structure for defining a set of functions in Lean. Specifically, in Lean, to define a set of functions (here, mappings from ℝ to ℝ), you typically use a set comprehension with a predicate, rather than a set of lambda functions directly. 

Your answer attempts to write: `{ λ _ => c | c ≠ 0 } where c ∈ ℝ`, which is syntactically invalid because `where c ∈ ℝ` isn't standard syntax; Lean expects a predicate function of type `(ℝ → ℝ) → Prop`.

Given the problem, the functions in the answer set are all constant functions c, with c ≠ 0. The set of all such functions can be represented as `{ f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x, f x = c ∧ c ≠ 0 }`.

Hence, the correct set definition in Lean should be: 

```lean
{ f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ x, f x = c ∧ c ≠ 0 }
```

This reads as: the set of all functions `f` from ℝ to ℝ such that there exists a real number `c` with `f x = c` for all `x`, and `c ≠ 0`.

Final answer:

<<<{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ x : ℝ, f x = c ∧ c ≠ 0}>>>
