The set consists of four-digit numbers divisible by 11, with their digit sum divisible by 11, which implies the number itself is divisible by 11. Therefore, these are four-digit multiples of 11. The total count is from 1001 to 9999, counting every step of 11.

Number of such n: ((9999 - 1001) / 11) + 1 = (8998 / 11) + 1 = 818 + 1 = 819.

<<<(9999 - 1000) / 11 + 1>>>
