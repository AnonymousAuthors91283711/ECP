  P2006AMCB_14_answer (B, J, N) = 165/100 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ × ℕ → ℚ
Given the cost equation (B * 4 * N + J * 5 * N) / 100 = 253/100, factoring out N yields N * (4 * B + 5 * J) = 253. Since N > 1, and 253 = 11 * 23, the minimal pairs for (4 * B + 5 * J) are divisors of 253, leading to B=11, J=23, N=1. To satisfy N > 1, multiply through by N=2: total cost sum = (4*11 + 5*23)*N = 165*N = 165*2=330/2=165/100 as per the cost with N=2.  
Final answer:  
<<<fun ⟨B, J, N⟩ => (165/100 : ℚ)>>>
