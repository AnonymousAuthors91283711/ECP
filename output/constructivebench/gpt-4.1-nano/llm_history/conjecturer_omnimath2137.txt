The sum of the lengths of digits in base 4 for numbers 1 to n involves counting the number of digits, which increases at powers of 4. From pattern, the total sums form a series involving powers of 4 and geometric progression. The simplified closed form accounts for digit lengths across these intervals.   
Hence, the answer is a function of powers of 4, accumulating digit counts.

<<<(2013 + 1) * (Nat.log 4 (2013 + 1) + 1) / 2 * 2>>>
