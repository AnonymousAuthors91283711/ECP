Ground Truth Answer: fun a b c => b^2 - 2 * a * c
Proposed Answer: fun a b c => a^2 - 2 * b
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem relates the roots (r,s,t) of a cubic polynomial to its coefficients (a,b,c) via Vieta's formulas. From the polynomial identity, we know:
   - r + s + t = -a
   - rs + rt + st = b
   - rst = -c

2. The expression to evaluate is (r*s)^2 + (s*t)^2 + (r*t)^2.

3. Let's expand this expression:
   (rs)^2 + (st)^2 + (rt)^2 = (rs + st + rt)^2 - 2rst(r + s + t)
   = b^2 - 2*(-c)*(-a) [substituting Vieta's relations]
   = b^2 - 2ac

4. The ground truth answer correctly gives this as b^2 - 2*a*c.

5. The proposed answer gives a^2 - 2*b, which is completely different and incorrect.

The proposed answer doesn't match the correct expansion and doesn't account for the relationships between the roots and coefficients properly.
