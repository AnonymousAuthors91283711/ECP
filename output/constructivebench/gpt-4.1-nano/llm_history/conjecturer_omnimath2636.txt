The problem asks for the smallest positive period \(k\) such that \(f(n + k) \equiv f(n) \pmod{23}\) for all \(n\), with \(f(n)\) multiples of 23. Since \(f(n) = 23m(n)\), the increments \(f(n + k) - f(n) = 23 (m(n + k) - m(n))\), are divisible by 23. The minimal positive \(k\) making the function periodic mod 23 relates to the period of \(m(n)\) modulo 23. Consequently, the minimal period is 1, as the multiples of 23 are trivially periodic with period 1.
