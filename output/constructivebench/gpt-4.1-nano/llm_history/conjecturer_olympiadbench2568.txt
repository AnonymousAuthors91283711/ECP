The quadratic and linear system imply x = - (5k + 3) / (2k) and substituting into the quadratic yields discriminant conditions. The form suggests that when discriminant is zero, the root coincides, so solutions exist for specific k. The critical value occurs at k = -1, where the equations degenerate. Based on the pattern, the set includes exactly those k for which the quadratic has a repeated root, i.e., discriminant zero.

Final set corresponds to k = -1.
