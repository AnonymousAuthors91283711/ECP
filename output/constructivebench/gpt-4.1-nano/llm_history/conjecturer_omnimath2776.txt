  ∃ x y : ℕ, 0 < x ∧ 0 < y ∧ 2^11 * 6^5 = 4^x * 3^y ∧ x + y = omnimath2776_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the prime factorization, \(2^{11} \times 6^5 = 2^{11} \times (2 \times 3)^5 = 2^{11+5} \times 3^5 = 2^{16} \times 3^5\).  
Matching exponents, we find \(4^x = 2^{2x}\), so \(2^{2x} = 2^{16}\), giving \(x=8\). Similarly, \(3^y = 3^5\), so \(y=5\).  
Sum: \(x + y = 8 + 5 = 13\).  
Answer: <<<13>>>
