abbrev omnimath1113_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath1113 :
  let dice := Fin 20
  let rolls := Fin 5 → dice
  let count20s (d : rolls) := (univ.filter (fun i => d i = 19)).card
  let total := (univ.filter (fun d : rolls => 3 ≤ count20s d)).card
  let success := (univ.filter (fun d : rolls => count20s d = 5)).card
  (success : ℚ) / (total : ℚ) = omnimath1113_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Based on pattern analysis, the problem involves probability of getting exactly 5 die rolls as 19s out of 5 rolls. Total outcomes: 20^5, success outcomes: 1, success probability: (1/20)^5.  
Final answer: <<<1 / 20^5>>>
