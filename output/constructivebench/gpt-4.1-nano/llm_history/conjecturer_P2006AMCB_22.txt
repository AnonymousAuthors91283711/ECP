The problem seeks the minimum n such that a + b + c = 2006 with positive integers a, b, c, and factorial product not divisible by 10. The factorial product's prime factors relate to the number of 2s and 5s, with the minimal n corresponding to the minimal excess of 2s over 5s in factorization. The minimal n occurs at the maximum of the sum's minimal factorial divisibility and minimal excess of 2s over 5s. The limiting factor is the deficit of 5s, which occurs at n = 1. Considering the requirement that m*10^n divides a!b!c! but m not divisible by 10, the minimal such n is 1.
