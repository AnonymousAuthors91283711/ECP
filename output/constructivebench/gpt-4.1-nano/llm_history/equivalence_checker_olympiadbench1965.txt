Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ (a : ℤ) (b : ℤ), f = (fun x => a * x + b) ∧ a > 0 ∧ olympiadbench1965_omega a = 0}
Proposed Answer: { g | ∀ x y : ℤ, x < y → olympiadbench1965_omega (g y - g x) ≤ olympiadbench1965_omega (y - x) }
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. The ground truth answer specifies that f must be a linear function f(x) = a*x + b with a > 0 and olympiadbench1965_omega a = 0 (meaning a has no prime factors > 10^100).

2. The proposed answer is more general - it only requires that the omega function (counting large prime factors) of differences doesn't increase when applying g.

The key differences:
- The proposed answer doesn't require linearity
- It doesn't explicitly require a > 0 (though this is implied by StrictMono in the theorem statement)
- It doesn't explicitly require olympiadbench1965_omega a = 0 for the coefficient

The proposed answer is strictly more general than the ground truth answer. There could be non-linear functions that satisfy the proposed condition but aren't linear functions with a > 0 and no large prime factors.
