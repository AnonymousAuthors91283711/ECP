Based on the pattern of values for P evaluated at 0, 1, and -1, and the symmetry considerations, the expression likely involves linear or quadratic functions of k. Noting the pattern in the enumerated answers, the function seems proportional to k, with adjustments. After analysis, the closed form for P2014AMCB_16_answer (k) appears to relate to a quadratic expression in k.

The main issue is that the proposed answer is a comment or description rather than a valid Lean expression. To correct this, I will derive a plausible closed-form expression based on the given conditions, which involve evaluating P at 0, 1, and -1, with relations involving k.

From the evaluations:
- P(0) = k
- P(1) = 2k
- P(-1) = 3k

Assuming P is quadratic (say, P(x) = a x^2 + b x + c), then:
- P(0) = c = k
- P(1) = a + b + c = 2k
- P(-1) = a - b + c = 3k

Subtract P(1) - P(-1):
(a + b + c) - (a - b + c) = 2b = -k
→ b = -k/2

From P(1):
a + b + c = 2k
a + (-k/2) + k = 2k
a + (k/2) = 2k
a = 2k - (k/2) = (4k/2) - (k/2) = (3k/2)

Now, P(2) = 4a + 2b + c = 4*(3k/2) + 2*(-k/2) + k = 6k - k + k = 6k

Similarly,
P(-2) = 4a - 2b + c = 4*(3k/2) - 2*(-k/2) + k = 6k + k + k = 8k

Adding P(2) + P(-2) = 6k + 8k = 14k

Given that the question asks for P(2) + P(-2) in terms of k, a natural expression for P2014AMCB_16_answer(k) is 14k.

The final closed-form expression in Lean would encompass this derivation as a straightforward function:

<<<fun k : ℝ => 14 * k>>>
