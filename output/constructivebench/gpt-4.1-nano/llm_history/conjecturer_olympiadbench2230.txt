Given the pattern and the context, the minimal value 'm' ensuring the existence of such mappings for any D, with D ≤ m, resembles the combinatorial bound derived from the structure of these mappings. The minimal number for such configurations relates to binary choices across the k elements, leading to a power of 2. The minimal m aligning with the pattern is 2^k.
