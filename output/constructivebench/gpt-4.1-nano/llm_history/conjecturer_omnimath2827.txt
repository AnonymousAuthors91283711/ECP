abbrev omnimath2827_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath2827 : 
  1/9 + 1/18 = 1/omnimath2827_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Because 1/9 + 1/18 = 2/18 + 1/18 = 3/18 = 1/6, the answer is 6. The pattern suggests the answer is the reciprocal of the sum's denominator. So, the explicit answer in Lean is:

<<<(6 : ℚ)>>>

This satisfies the theorem, as 1/6 + 1/18 = 1/9.
