The sequence of points forms a path through the vertices of a 4D hypercube with 1-bit differences, length 4, starting at 0 and ending at 1, with each consecutive pair differing in exactly one coordinate. There are 4! = 24 such Hamiltonian paths. The total number of such paths is 24, but since the problem asks for the cardinality of a set of paths satisfying these conditions, the answer is 24.
