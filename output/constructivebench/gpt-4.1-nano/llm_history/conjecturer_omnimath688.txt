Given the pattern in provided solutions and the sum of factorials over integers, the only pair that satisfies m^2 equals the sum of factorials from 1 to n is (m, n) = (1, 1). Because 1! = 1, and 1^2 = 1.

Current Proposed Answer: Given the pattern in provided solutions and the sum of factorials over integers, the only pair that satisfies m^2 equals the sum of factorials from 1 to n is (m, n) = (1, 1). Because 1! = 1, and 1^2 = 1.

The main syntax issues in the provided Lean code arise from using the incorrect notation for sums and an invalid abbreviation definition that includes a narrative explanation. According to the error messages, you should use the notation `∑ i ∈ Finset.Icc 1 n, (i)!` for sums, and all notation should be encapsulated properly in the `abbrev` declaration without commentary or prose.

Given the sum of factorials from 1 to n, the only natural candidate that matches a perfect square like m² is m=1, n=1, since 1! = 1 and 1² = 1. For larger n, factorial sums quickly surpass perfect squares, and checking small cases suggests no others.

Based on the pattern, the answer set contains only the pair (1, 1). I will define the answer set directly as `{(1, 1)}` in Lean, ensuring the syntax is valid and consistent.
