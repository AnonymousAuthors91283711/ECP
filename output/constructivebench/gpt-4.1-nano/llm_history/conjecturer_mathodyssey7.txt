The pattern suggests the maximum `n` satisfying the divisibility condition relates to the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the interval, which increases with `n`. Since the set is from `n` to `n+100`, as `n` grows, the LCM tends to grow indefinitely, but for the greatest `n` where the condition holds, it is likely the `n` such that the LCM divides the product exactly, i.e., at the upper endpoint minus 1. Given the pattern, the specific maximum is at `n = 0`.
