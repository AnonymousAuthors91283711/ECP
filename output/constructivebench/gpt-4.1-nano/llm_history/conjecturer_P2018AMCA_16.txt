Given the set structure involving points on the parabola and circle, the only real values for a leading to exactly three solutions relate to the intersection points of the parabola \( y = x^2 - a \) and circle \( x^2 + y^2 = a^2 \), with the nature of solutions depending on the value of \( a \). The critical value occurs when the line \( y = x^2 - a \) intersects the circle at three points, which happens when \( a > 0 \) and the parabola passes through the circle at exactly three points (including the tangent point and two more). This condition is satisfied precisely when \( a > 0 \).
