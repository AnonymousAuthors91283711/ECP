Ground Truth Answer: 16
Proposed Answer: 4
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

The problem is about counting the number of functions c: ℤ × ℤ → Fin 2 (i.e., functions from integer pairs to a 2-element set) that satisfy two functional equations:
1. c(a, b) = c(-1 - b, a + 1)
2. c(a, b) = c(1 - b, a - 1)

The ground truth answer is 16, while the proposed answer is 4.

To evaluate this, we need to understand the structure of the problem:
1. The functional equations create equivalence classes of points where the function must have the same value
2. The number of distinct functions would be 2^k where k is the number of independent equivalence classes
3. The ground truth suggests there are 4 independent equivalence classes (since 2^4 = 16)
4. The proposed answer of 4 would correspond to 2^2 = 4, suggesting only 2 independent classes

The proposed answer is incorrect because it underestimates the number of independent equivalence classes created by these functional relations. The correct number is indeed 4 independent classes, leading to 2^4 = 16 possible functions.
