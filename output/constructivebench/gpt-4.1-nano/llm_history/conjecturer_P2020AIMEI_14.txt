The roots include 3, 4, a, b; the quadratic polynomial's roots (a, b) appear with roots 3, 4, so (a + b) is related to the symmetric sum. Given the set of roots, the sum of roots is 7 + a + b, but since the roots are {3, 4, a, b}, the pertinent symmetric sum (a + b) can be expressed directly. The pattern suggests that the answer is the square of the sum of the roots aside from 3 and 4, which simplifies to (7)^2 = 49. 

Final answer in Lean:

<<<49>>>
