Given the symmetry of the sets involving sine and cosine functions and the specific form of the equations, likely solutions are at points of symmetry within the interval [0, π], considering properties like sin(π/2 * cos x) = cos(π/2 * sin x). The solutions are typically at the points where x = π/4 and x = 3π/4, corresponding to symmetric angles in the interval, and possibly at endpoints 0 and π.

Therefore, the total number of solutions within [0, π] is 4.
