The pattern suggests the maximum element is the largest power of two less than or equal to the sum of two identical elements, with all elements greater than zero and pairwise satisfying x + y = 2^k. The key insight is that the set with maximum element is the singleton containing that maximum element, which is a power of two.

Answer:
<<<2^k>>>

where \(k\) corresponds to the largest such exponent less than or equal to the sum condition, i.e., as large as possible while maintaining all constraints. More precisely, the greatest element should be a power of two, so the final form is: 

<<<2^k where k is maximal with 2^k ≤ n>>>

The enumeration of answers and clues suggest that the problem involves the property that the sum of any two distinct elements in the set equals a power of two, and we seek the greatest such n satisfying this. The pattern of the summation and the nature of the property strongly imply that the set size is bounded by 2, because for more than two elements, the sum condition becomes too restrictive. The key is that the sum of any two elements equals 2^k for some k, so the set contains pairs whose sums are powers of two. Because these elements are positive and pairwise summing to powers of two, the maximum possible set size should be 2 — the largest set satisfying the property has exactly two elements.

In Lean, the answer is a specific numeral, namely 2, representing the maximal size of such a set. The current code attempts to define `omnimath3756_answer` as `2^k`, but `k` is undefined outside the context of the summation, so it results in an unknown identifier error. Since the maximum cardinality of the set is 2, a closed-form answer is simply 2. This fits the expected type ℕ and the pattern of the enumerated answers.

The main issues with the provided code are:

1. The large comment or explanation is incorrectly placed directly after `abbrev ... :=`, which should expect a concrete ℕ value, but the explanation is not a numeral, leading to a syntax error.
2. The `abbrev omnimath3756_answer : ℕ :=` line must be assigned a numerical value (here, 2) — so the logical conclusion based on the pattern of the problem is to set the answer to 2.
3. Any further comment or reasoning can be placed in comments (`--`) after the definition.

Thus, the fixed formula simplifies to directly assigning `2` as the answer, with the understanding that the maximum size of such a set under the specified conditions is 2.

The main issues with the provided code are:

1. The `abbrev ... :=` line must assign a concrete ℕ value; it cannot include explanations or comments directly.
2. The mathematical problem suggests that the maximum size of such a set satisfying the conditions is 2, based on the nature of the constraints involving sums of pairs equating to powers of two, and the positivity condition.
3. Therefore, the natural, simple answer is to set `omnimath3756_answer := 2`.

This choice is supported by the pattern of such problems, where the maximal size of a set with all elements positive, pairwise sums equal to powers of two, tends to be small—specifically, 2, since larger sets invariably cause contradictions.

Hence, the corrected, finalized answer in Lean is:

The main issues are the misuse of `abbrev`—which should be used solely for defining a symbol without immediate instantiation—and the recursive or circular definition attempted in the current line. Furthermore, since the goal is to identify the greatest such `n`, the candidate answer should reflect the maximal `n` satisfying the property. Based on the problem constraints, and the structure of the set, I conjecture that the maximal `n` is 2, because for `n=2`, the set `{1,2}` satisfies the conditions: both are positive, and their sums (`1+1=2`, `1+2=3`, `2+2=4`) relate to powers of 2 as `2=2^1`, `3` not a power of 2, `4=2^2`. But since \(x \neq y\) in the definition, only `x+y=2^k` when \(x \neq y\), so pairs like `(1,2)` satisfy `1+2=3` (not a power), but `(2,2)` should be excluded because `x ≠ y` is required for the relation.

Hence the critical candidate is `n=2`. For larger `n`, the set of positive integers with all pairwise sums being powers of two is less likely to extend past `2`. Therefore, the answer should be `2`.

Thus, the correct Lean code is:

<<<2>>>

This is both simple and aligns with the enumeration constraints, making `2` the candidate for the greatest such `n`.
