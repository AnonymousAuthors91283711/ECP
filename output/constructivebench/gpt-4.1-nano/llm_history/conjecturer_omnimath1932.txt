  IsLeast {x : ℝ | x = 54 * sqrt 3 ∨ x = 144 ∨ x = 108 * sqrt 6 - 108 * sqrt 2} omnimath1932_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern in the enumerated answers suggests the answer involves combining radicals with coefficients related to square roots, with key candidates being manipulated versions of the given values. The simplest closed form that encompasses the options and is consistent with radicals involving sqrt 3 and sqrt 6 is 54 * sqrt 3, which appears prominently. Given the context, the least of the options should be the minimal value, which is 54 * sqrt 3. The pattern indicates the answer should be this minimal element, directly represented.
