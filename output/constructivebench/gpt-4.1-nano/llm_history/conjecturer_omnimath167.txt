Given that the problem involves computability and modular properties of powers of 2, the key insight is recognizing numbers n for which 2^{2^n} mod (2^n - 1) ≠ 4^k for all k, especially noting the value of n where this relation fails. The pattern suggests checking n values and recognizing a specific n (like n=5) where the relation does not hold. Based on the enumerated answers hint and typical behavior, the conjectured answer is n=5.
