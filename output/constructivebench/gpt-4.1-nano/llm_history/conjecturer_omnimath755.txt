Looking at the conditions: a + b + c = 100, a*b + b*c + c*a = 20, (a + b)(a + c) = 24, which simplifies to a^2 + a(b + c) = 24. The goal is to find the set of possible values for b*c.

From the second and third, express b+c and other relations, resulting in b*c being uniquely determined or restricted. The data suggests b*c is a specific constant value.

The consistent solution indicates that b*c = 2.
