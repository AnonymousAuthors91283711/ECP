Given the structure, to maximize blue's size (k), each point p in blue must have exactly 2 red points on its unit circle. Since each red point can belong to at most two such circles, the maximum number k equals k maximizing the total blue points while satisfying the constraints. The strongest maximum is achieved when blue covers all possible points with only overlaps needed for two red points per blue point. Therefore, the maximal blue size under these constraints is (2009 - 2) / 2, plus 1 if the total number of red points is even; in this case, considering the pattern, the maximal k simplifies to 1004. 
The answer expression:  
<<<(2009 - 2) / 2>>>
