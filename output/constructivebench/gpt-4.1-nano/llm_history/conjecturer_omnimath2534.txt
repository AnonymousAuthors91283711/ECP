theorem omnimath2534
(h a r v m i t : ℝ)
(hard : h * a * r * v * a * r * d = 100 ∧ m * i * t = 100 ∧ h * m * m * t = 100)
: (r * a * d) * (t * r * i * v * i * a) = omnimath2534_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Since all given equations equal 100 and involve symmetric products, the pattern suggests Each product reduces to 10, combining to 100. Simplifying yields the final product.
