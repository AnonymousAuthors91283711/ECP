Given the structure, the expression likely involves counting certain subsets or configurations within the interval from 1 to n. Based on the enumeration hint (though not explicitly given), the pattern suggests a combination involving powers of 2 (for subset choices) and sums involving n.

Considering the nature of the set conditions and the pattern observed in similar combinatorial problems, a common closed-form expression involves n multiplied by 2 to the power (n-2), possibly scaled or shifted.

Therefore, the conjectured closed-form answer is:

<<<fun n : ℕ => n * 2^(n - 2)>>>
