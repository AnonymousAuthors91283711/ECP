theorem omnimath2731 (x : ℝ) :
    (5 + x) / 2 = 7 ∧ (x + 9) / 2 = 12 ∧ (5 + 9) / 2 = 10 ↔ x = omnimath2731_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The system provides three equations with inconsistent middle terms: (5 + x)/2 = 7, (x + 9)/2=12, and (5 + 9)/2=10. The third is false, so the conjunction is false. For the biconditional to hold, the equations must be consistent, which implies x = 9. Therefore, the answer is 9. 

<<<9>>>
