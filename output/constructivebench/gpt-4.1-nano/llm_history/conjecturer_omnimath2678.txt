  (5 ^ 35 - 6 ^ 21) % 10 = omnimath2678_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the last digit of expressions involving powers of 5 and 6. Since \(5^{n}\) ends with 5 for \(n \ge 1\), and \(6^{n}\) ends with 6 for \(n \ge 1\), then \(5^{35}\) ends with 5, and \(6^{21}\) ends with 6. Thus, the last digit of \(5^{35} - 6^{21}\) is \(5 - 6 \equiv -1 \equiv 9 \pmod{10}\).
