The condition \(N/10 = 9 \times (N \% 1000)\) simplifies to a form expressing \(N\) as a multiple of 10, where the quotient relates to the last three digits. Since \(N<10000\), analyzing the pattern suggests the largest possible \(N\) satisfying these constraints occurs when \(N\) is of the form \(999 \times 10 + \text{a small digit}\). The answer consolidates these constraints into a closed form, leading to:

<<<9990>>>
