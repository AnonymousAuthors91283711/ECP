theorem omnimath513 :
  tsum (fun (n : {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (2 * n) ∣ φ n}) => (1 / (n : ℚ))) = omnimath513_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Given the sum over reciprocal of n where n divides φ(n), and n > 0, the pattern suggests the sum equals 1/2. The divergence of the sum is controlled by the divisibility constraint, leading to a convergent series summing to 1/2.
