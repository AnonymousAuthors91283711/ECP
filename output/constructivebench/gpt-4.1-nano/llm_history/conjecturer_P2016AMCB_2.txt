  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∀ k : ℕ, |(2 * 1 * 2016) / (1 + 2016 : ℝ) - n| ≤ |(2 * 1 * 2016) / (1 + 2016 : ℝ) - k|} P2016AMCB_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern in the enumerated answers suggests that the minimal n is very close to the expression (2 * 1 * 2016) / (1 + 2016). Since 2 * 1 * 2016 = 4032 and 1 + 2016 = 2017, the precise value is 4032 / 2017. As the closest integer, this is either floor or ceiling. The absolute value difference indicates that the least n is the integer closest to this ratio. Based on typical rounding, the answer should be the integer near 4032/2017, which is 2. Thus, the minimal n is 2.

<<<2>>>
