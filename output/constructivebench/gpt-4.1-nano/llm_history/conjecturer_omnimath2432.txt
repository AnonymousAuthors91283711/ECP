The pattern suggests the set is the entire ℝ, as for any real y, choosing appropriate positive a and b can approximate y; therefore, the set covers all real numbers.

The core of the problem is identifying the set of all real numbers y that can be expressed as (a * b + b^2) / (a^2 + b^2) where a, b > 0. The raw set provided, `set.univ`, is the set of all real numbers, which doesn't match the expression's image. The goal, therefore, is to determine the actual image set of the function f(a, b) := (a * b + b^2) / (a^2 + b^2) for a, b > 0.

By analyzing the function, set theory, and limits:
- Fixing b > 0 and varying a > 0, the expression approaches 1 as a → 0+, and approaches 0 as a → ∞.
- Fixing a > 0 and varying b > 0, the expression ranges over (0, 1).
- Symmetry suggests the range over positive a, b covers the open interval (0, 1).

Thus, the image set is the open interval (0, 1).

**Final Lean answer:**
<<<{ y : ℝ | 0 < y ∧ y < 1 }>>>
