abbrev omnimath1169_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath1169 :
  let Ea := (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) / 6
  let Eb := Ea * (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) / 6
  let Ec := Eb * (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) / 6
  Ec = omnimath1169_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Because each of Ea, Eb, Ec involves (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) / 6 = 21/6 = 7/2, and multiplication by itself, Ec simplifies to (7/2)^3, which is 343/8.
<<<(7/2) ^ 3>>>
