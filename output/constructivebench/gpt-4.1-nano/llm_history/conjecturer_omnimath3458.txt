theorem omnimath3458
    (p : Fin 4 → ℝ)
    (hpdiff : ∀ i j, i ≠ j → p i ≠ p j)
    (hp2 : ∀ i : Fin 3, p i > 0 ∧ p (i + 1) = 2 * p i) :
    (p 3) / (p 3 + p 2 + p 1 + p 0) = omnimath3458_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Since p is geometric for i < 3, p 1 = p 0 * 2, p 2 = p 1 * 2 = p 0 * 4, and p 3 = p 2 * 2 = p 0 * 8. Sum = p 0 + 2p 0 + 4p 0 + 8p 0 = 15p 0. Ratio = p 3 / sum = 8p 0 / 15p 0 = 8/15.
