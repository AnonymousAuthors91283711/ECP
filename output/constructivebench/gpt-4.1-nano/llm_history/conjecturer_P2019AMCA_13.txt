The problem restricts colorings c with a divisibility condition, excluding certain equalities. The pattern indicates counting these colorings, often related to cyclic arrangements and divisibility restrictions. Given enumeration hints, the pattern suggests that the total count follows a known combinatorial formula involving powers of 3 and restrictions.  
Conjecture: Counting valid functions c corresponds to the total arrangements minus forbidden pairs, leading to the total being \( 3^{8} - 3^{\gcd(8, 2)} \). Since \(\gcd(8, 2) = 2\), the answer is \( 3^{8} - 3^{2} \).   

Final Answer:
<<<3^8 - 3^2>>>
