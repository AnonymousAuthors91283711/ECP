Since cos (arctan x) = x when x satisfies x = 1 / sqrt(1 + x^2), solving this yields x^3 + x - 1 = 0; thus, the unique real solution is the real root of this cubic. The answer is the real root of x^3 + x - 1 = 0.

The error indicates that `nthRoot` is not recognized because it is not imported or defined in the current context. In Lean's mathlib, the standard way to express fractional roots (like square roots, cube roots) is by using `real.rpow` with fractional exponents.

Given the proposed answer `(nthRoot (1/2) (3))`, which seems to be the cube root of 3, the correct Lean expression is `3 ^ (1/3)`.

Furthermore, from the theorem description, the solution `x` satisfies `cos (arctan x) = x` and `x^2 = omnimath1366_answer`. The most natural closed-form answer for such a problem would be to set `x` as the cube root of 3, because it satisfies the relevant properties derived from the trigonometric and algebraic conditions that relate `x` with cube roots.

Therefore, the fixed answer, in a concise closed form, is:

The error occurs because '<<<' and '>>>' are not valid syntax in Lean; they are used for delimiters in the prompt format, but should not appear in the code. The answer should be directly assigned as a Lean expression. 

In the mathematical context, the equation involves the relationships \( x > 0 \), \( \cos(\arctan x) = x \), and \( x^2 = \text{answer} \). The key insight here is that the equation \( \cos(\arctan x) = x \) is related to a special angle; by using the trigonometric identities, one finds that \( x \) satisfies a particular algebraic equation, which leads to \( x = 3^{1/3} \). 

The solution \( x = 3^{1/3} \) (the real cube root of 3) is positive, and satisfies the necessary conditions. Thus, the answer should be expressed directly as `(3 : ℝ) ^ (1/3)`.

To fix the error, I will assign the expression without delimiters and ensure it is well-formed in Lean. 

**Conjectured final answer:**

<<<(3 : ℝ) ^ (1/3)>>>

**Explanations:**  
- We interpret the answer as the real cube root of 3, which is positive, satisfying the given equations.  
- The syntax `(3 : ℝ) ^ (1/3)` accurately represents the cube root in Lean.  
- No special delimiters (`<<<`/`>>>`) are necessary or valid within Lean code; they are only for parsing in the prompt.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The proposed answer `' and '` causes a syntax error because it is not valid Lean syntax; it appears to be a string placeholder or an incorrect attempt to define a real number.

Based on the structure of the problem, the theorem states that there exists a unique \( x \in \mathbb{R} \) satisfying certain conditions involving the cosine and arctangent functions, and \( x^2 = \text{some real number} \). 

Given the problem involves \(\cos(\arctan x) = x\), we recall the identity:
\[
\cos(\arctan x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}
\]
which leads to the equation:
\[
x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}
\]
or equivalently:
\[
x^2 = \frac{1}{1 + x^2}
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
x^2 (1 + x^2) = 1
\]
or:
\[
x^4 + x^2 - 1 = 0
\]

The solutions for \( x^2 \) are roots of the quadratic:
\[
t^2 + t - 1 = 0
\]
where \( t = x^2 \). Solving this quadratic:
\[
t = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]
Since \( t = x^2 \ge 0 \), only positive solutions count, thus:
\[
x^2 = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}
\]
as \(\frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} < 0\).

Hence, the unique \( x \) with \( 0 < x \) satisfying the equation is:
\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}}
\]

And the squared value is exactly \( \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} \).

Therefore, the answer we should define as `omnimath1366_answer` is \( \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} \). 

To keep it concise and within the framework, the final answer in Lean syntax is:

<<<(sqrt 5 - 1) / 2>>>

This is a real number, positive, and aligns with the derived algebraic condition.

The current proposed answer has multiple issues: there's an incorrect repeated declaration with "noncomputable abbrev," and the initial abbreviation is not correctly defined in Lean syntax. The problem requires a closed-form answer expressed as a real number satisfying the given conditions: it is positive, satisfies cos (arctan x) = x, and x^2 equals the answer. Noticing that the conditions are tight, the key is to analyze cos (arctan x) and relate it to x.

From the identity cos (arctan x) = 1 / √(1 + x^2), and the condition cos (arctan x) = x, we get:

x = 1 / √(1 + x^2) ⇒ x^2 = 1 / (1 + x^2)

which implies:

x^2 (1 + x^2) = 1 ⇒ x^2 + x^4 = 1

This quadratic in y := x^2 is:

y + y^2 = 1 ⇒ y^2 + y - 1 = 0

solving yields:

y = ( -1 ± √(1 + 4) ) / 2 = ( -1 ± √5 ) / 2

Since x > 0, we select the positive root:

y = (√5 - 1)/ 2

Therefore, the answer is x^2 = y = (√5 - 1)/ 2, and x = sqrt y.

This matches the given answer in the enumeration and fits the conditions.

---

**Final Answer:**

<<<(sqrt ((sqrt 5 - 1) / 2))>>>

---

**Note:** The expression is wrapped in `sqrt` since x > 0. The value of x satisfying all conditions is positive, and this closed form is consistent with the analysis.
