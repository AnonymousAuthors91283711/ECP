Ground Truth Answer: fun N => 2^(N - 2) + 1
Proposed Answer: fun N : ℕ => N + 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal number M such that any collection of M boolean functions on N variables must contain a subset of N functions that agree on a common output value for all inputs (either all true or all false at each position).

2. The ground truth answer is 2^(N-2) + 1, which grows exponentially with N. This makes sense combinatorially as it's related to covering all possible boolean function patterns.

3. The proposed answer is N + 2, which grows linearly with N. This is clearly different from the exponential growth of the correct answer.

4. For N=4:
   - Ground truth: 2^(4-2)+1 = 5
   - Proposed: 4+2 = 6
   These are different values.

5. For N=5:
   - Ground truth: 2^(5-2)+1 = 9
   - Proposed: 5+2 = 7
   The proposed answer is actually smaller than the correct answer here, which would make it incorrect since it wouldn't satisfy the condition.
