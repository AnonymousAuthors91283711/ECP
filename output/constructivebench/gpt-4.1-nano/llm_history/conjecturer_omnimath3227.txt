theorem omnimath3227 :
  Real.log (∏ a in Finset.range 2015, ∏ b in Finset.range 2015, 
    (1 + exp (2 * π * I * (a * b : ℝ) / 2015))).re / Real.log 2 = omnimath3227_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the structure involving roots of unity and the double product over ranges up to 2015, the key is recognizing the sum over exponents resulting in divisible sums of roots of unity, which cancel unless certain divisibility conditions are met. The pattern suggests that the sum evaluates to a power of 2, specifically 2015, since each term contributes to the net log corresponding to verifying divisibility properties over the finite cyclic group.
