The polynomial must have roots \(z\) satisfying \(z^5 + 2004z = 1\), which are complex solutions related to roots of unity and specific symmetrical properties. The problem hints at evaluating a polynomial at \(z^2\), with conditions simplified by symmetry, and considering the ratio at 1 and -1 suggests the polynomial evaluations relate to roots symmetric around zero. Given the pattern, the ratio simplifies to \(\frac{1 + \text{something}}{1 - \text{something}}\), which tends towards \(-1\) due to the symmetry and the nature of solutions involved in such polynomial equations.

The simplified closed-form appears to be \(-1\).
