Given the polynomial \(X^{10} + X^9 + X^6 + X^5 + X^4 + X + 1\), the minimal positive \(k\) such that it divides \(X^k - 1\) corresponds to the order of a root of the polynomial, which is the least common multiple of the roots' orders.

From the pattern in the enumerated answers and the known roots, the polynomial's roots have orders dividing 11 and 5, which are coprime; thus, the order is their least common multiple: 55.

<<<55>>>
