    2^x * 3^y = 1296 ↔ x + y = P2004AMCB_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given \( 2^x * 3^y = 1296 \), express \( x + y \) explicitly. Note \( 1296 = 2^4 * 3^4 \). For the product to equal 1296, the exponents must match: \( x = 4 \) and \( y = 4 \). Hence, \( x + y = 8 \).
