theorem omnimath3050 : 
  4 * (4 * 5 + 2) + 2 = omnimath3050_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern in enumerated answers suggests a construction involving multiplication and addition, possibly reflecting values related to the initial expression's constants. Simplifying 4*(4*5 + 2)+2 yields 4*(20+2)+2=4*22+2=88+2=90. The pattern indicates the answer is directly this computed value.

<<<90>>>
