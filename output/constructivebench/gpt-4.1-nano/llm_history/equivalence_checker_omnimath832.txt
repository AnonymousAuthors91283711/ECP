Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines two recursive sequences:
   - squirrel: starts at 1, each term is 2*previous + 2019
   - rabbit: starts at 1, each term is 4*previous - 2

2. We need to find the smallest y > 0 where rabbit(y) > squirrel(y), and prove it's unique.

3. Calculating initial terms:
   - squirrel(1) = 2*1 + 2019 = 2021
   - rabbit(1) = 4*1 - 2 = 2 (which is < 2021)
   - squirrel(2) = 2*2021 + 2019 = 6061
   - rabbit(2) = 4*2 - 2 = 6 (still < 6061)
   - This pattern continues for many terms before rabbit overtakes squirrel

4. The ground truth answer is 13, which is correct based on the growth rates (rabbit grows exponentially faster).

5. The proposed answer is 1, which is clearly incorrect as shown by the calculations above.
