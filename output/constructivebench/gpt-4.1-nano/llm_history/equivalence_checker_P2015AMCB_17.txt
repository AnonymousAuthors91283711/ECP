Ground Truth Answer: 11
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n > 1 that satisfies a particular binomial probability equation involving combinations and probabilities (1/4 and 3/4).

2. The equation can be simplified to:
   choose(n,2)*(1/4)^2*(3/4)^(n-2) = choose(n,3)*(1/4)^3*(3/4)^(n-3)

3. Simplifying further:
   choose(n,2)*(3/4) = choose(n,3)*(1/4)
   => 3*choose(n,2) = choose(n,3)

4. Expressing in factorial terms:
   3*n!/(2!(n-2)!) = n!/(3!(n-3)!)
   => 3/(2!(n-2)(n-3)!) = 1/(6(n-3)!)
   => 3(n-2) = 6
   => n-2 = 2
   => n = 4

The proposed answer 4 correctly solves the simplified equation. The ground truth answer 11 appears to be incorrect based on this derivation.
