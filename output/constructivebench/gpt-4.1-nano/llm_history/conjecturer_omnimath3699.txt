  omnimath3699_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests a minimal A ≡ 0 mod 2018 with odd digit count, and a related B fitting the pattern, differing in a specific digit. Among candidates, the smallest A satisfying all conditions is 2018 itself, with B = 1009, which aligns with the digit and divisibility pattern. 

Hence, the answer is 2018. 

<<<2018>>>
