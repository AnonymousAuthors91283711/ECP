The minimal n satisfying the recursive ant_position appraoch reaches at least 1 is when the sum of fractions exceeds 1. This sum equals the harmonic sum of 1/(4+(k-1)), which behaves like the harmonic series shifted by 4. To reach ≥ 1, the sum of enough terms of 1/(4 + (k-1)) must be ≥ 1, so n approx satisfies sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 1/(4 + k) ≥ 1. This estimate suggests n ≈ 13.

Final answer: <<<13>>>
