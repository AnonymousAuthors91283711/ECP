Ground Truth Answer: {P : Polynomial ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, P = c * (Polynomial.X ^ 2 + Polynomial.C 3)}
Proposed Answer: { P : Polynomial ℝ | ∀ x y z : ℝ, x ≠ 0 ∧ y ≠ 0 ∧ z ≠ 0 → (2 * x * y * z = x + y + z → (P.eval x / (y * z) + P.eval y / (z * x) + P.eval z / (x * y) = P.eval (x - y) + P.eval (y - z) + P.eval (z - x))) }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but differs slightly in the logical structure. The ground truth answer specifies the exact form of the polynomials that satisfy the condition (quadratic polynomials with a specific form), while the proposed answer restates the condition from the problem statement without providing the explicit solution. The proposed answer is correct in terms of the condition it describes, but it doesn't provide the concrete characterization that the ground truth answer does. Therefore, they are not fully equivalent, but the proposed answer is close to being correct.
