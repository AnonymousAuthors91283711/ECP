theorem olympiadbench2275 : 
  (digits 10 ((10^3 + 1)^2)).sum = olympiadbench2275_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests summing digits of a specific number involving powers and addition. The given expression is (10^3 + 1)^2 = 1001^2 = 1,002,001; summing its digits: 1+0+0+2+0+0+1 = 4. The enumerated answer hints at the pattern for similarly structured powers: the sum appears to be 4 for the case n=3. Extending the pattern, for (10^n + 1)^2, the digit sum forms a pattern with 2n-2 plus 4. For n=3, this gives 4. Thus, the general form, verified with the pattern, is 4. 
<<<4>>>

(Note: The detailed reasoning is based on the pattern from the enumeration and digit sums; the final formula matches the observed result for n=3.)
