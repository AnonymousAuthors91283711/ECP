The problem seeks the minimal number n such that any subset T of {1,..,280} with size n contains a 5-element subset of pairwise coprime numbers. The maximal such subset is the size of the largest pairwise coprime subset, which is determined by the maximum number of mutually coprime integers up to 280. It is well-known that the maximum size is close to the number of primes up to 280, but the set of primes is only 53. To guarantee 5 pairwise coprime numbers, the minimal such n is just above the size needed to ensure a 5-element subset, which is 53 + 1. So the answer is 54.
