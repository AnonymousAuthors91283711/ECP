Given the equations y = log_{10} x^4 and y = (log_{10} x)^3, and the relation between log x and log_{10} x, I conclude that y must be (log_{10} x)^3, with x > 0. Combining the two, (log_{10} x)^3 = 4 log_{10} x, which implies log_{10} x = 0 or 4. These give x = 1 or 10^4 = 10000. Correspondingly, y = 0^3 = 0 or 4^3 = 64. Therefore, the points are (1, 0) and (10000, 64).

The error arises because the 'abbrev olympiadbench2376_answer' is assigned a non-Lean comment or natural language description instead of a set of points. To rectify this, the correct approach is to define the answer as a set of point tuples explicitly, using Lean syntax.

Given the derivation, the solutions are (x, y) = (1, 0) and (10000, 64), corresponding to the roots of the equations. Our answer should be:

- The set containing these two points, as `(set.univ.filter (λ p, p = (1, 0) ∨ p = (10000, 64)))`.

- To ensure the comprehension uses real standard notation, we explicitly state the set as `{ (1, 0), (10000, 64) }`.

Thus, the final fixed answer in Lean syntax is:

<<<{ (1, 0), (10000, 64) }>>>

This correctly formats a set of pairs of real numbers in Lean, satisfying the problem's requirement for a formal, closed-form answer.
