  Finset.card (Finset.filter (fun n => 6 ∈ digits 10 n) (Finset.range 100)) = omnimath2973_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern in enumerated answers and the problem's constraints, the key digit 6 appears only in numbers 60–69 within 0–99. There are exactly 10 such numbers, each containing the digit 6. Thus, the count equals 10.
