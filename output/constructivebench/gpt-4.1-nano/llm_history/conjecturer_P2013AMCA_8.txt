Since x ≠ y and x, y ≠ 0 with x + 2/x = y + 2/y, the solutions are symmetric around x = y. The relation reduces to quadratic in x, leading to x y = x^2, y^2, or related symmetric expressions. From pattern, a plausible closed-form solution is \( x y = x y \), but considering symmetry, the key solution is \( x y = 1 \).
