Ground Truth Answer: -18
Proposed Answer: -6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the least value of a sum of quadratic expressions evaluated at four points forming a unit square (p1 to p4).

2. The expressions for each point are similar: x² + 2x + y² + 4y (with x,y coordinates adjusted for each point).

3. Let's expand the sum for all four points:
   - p1: (x)² + 2x + y² + 4y
   - p2: (x+1)² + 2(x+1) + y² + 4y
   - p3: (x+1)² + 2(x+1) + (y+1)² + 4(y+1)
   - p4: x² + 2x + (y+1)² + 4(y+1)

4. When we expand and combine all terms, we get:
   4x² + 8x + 4y² + 16y + 12

5. This can be rewritten as:
   4(x² + 2x) + 4(y² + 4y) + 12

6. Completing the squares:
   4[(x+1)² - 1] + 4[(y+2)² - 4] + 12
   = 4(x+1)² + 4(y+2)² - 4 - 16 + 12
   = 4(x+1)² + 4(y+2)² - 8

7. The minimum occurs when (x+1)² = 0 and (y+2)² = 0, giving -8.

However, neither the ground truth (-18) nor the proposed answer (-6) matches this calculation. There seems to be a discrepancy in either the problem statement or the answers.

Given that both answers differ from our calculation, and they differ from each other:

<<<False>>>
