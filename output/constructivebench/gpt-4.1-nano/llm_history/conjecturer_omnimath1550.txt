Since the divisibility involves the product of prime powers, and those primes are 2, 3, 5, 7 raised to certain powers, the possible values of n are prime powers with exponents less than or equal to the respective powers, but also must be perfect squares (since m ^ 2 = n). The shared prime factors are 2 ^ 3, 3 ^ 5, 5 ^ 7, 7 ^ 9. For each prime p, the exponent in n must be an even number ≤ the prime's exponent in the product.

Thus, the possible exponents are: 
- For 2: even numbers ≤ 3 → 0, 2
- For 3: even numbers ≤ 5 → 0, 2, 4
- For 5: even numbers ≤ 7 → 0, 2, 4, 6
- For 7: even numbers ≤ 9 → 0, 2, 4, 6, 8

Number of options for each prime is (exponent // 2) + 1.

Total combinations: ( (3 // 2) + 1 ) * ( (5 // 2) + 1 ) * ( (7 // 2) + 1 ) * ( (9 // 2) + 1 ) = 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.

The corresponding n's are products of p^{e_p} for each prime p, with e_p as above.

The error arises because the initial definition in the answer is using a natural language explanation instead of a formal Lean expression. The intended answer appears to be the count of all such n, which are perfect squares dividing the product \( 2^3 * 3^5 * 5^7 * 7^9 \), with exponents in the range of even numbers less than or equal to these prime exponents.

From the explanation, the possible even exponents for each prime are:
- For 2: 0, 2 (since 3 in total, only even numbers ≤ 3)
- For 3: 0, 2, 4
- For 5: 0, 2, 4, 6
- For 7: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8

Number of options = (number of exponents for each prime) = (2)*(3)*(4)*(5) = 120.

The count is simply the total number of divisor combinations with these exponents.

Hence, the answer is: 120.

Going further, the explicit form in Lean encapsulates the count of such n's.

The corrected code should be:

```lean
<<<120>>>  
```

To generalize from the enumerated answer, the answer is a constant number representing all such perfect squares dividing the number \( 2^3 * 3^5 * 5^7 * 7^9 \) with exponents even and non-negative.

The error occurs because the answer was included with delimiters (<<< >>>), which are not valid syntax in Lean. The line `abbrev omnimath1550_answer : ℕ := <<<120>>>` should directly assign the numerical value 120 without delimiters. 

Based on the problem statement, we're asked to find the size of the set of perfect squares `n` such that `m^2 = n` divides a specific product of prime powers. The set of `m^2` dividing the product corresponds to square divisors of that product. 

The product is:
2^3 * 3^5 * 5^7 * 7^9

Number of divisors for each prime power is:
- For 2^3: exponents 0..3, so 4 options.
- For 3^5: exponents 0..5, so 6 options.
- For 5^7: exponents 0..7, so 8 options.
- For 7^9: exponents 0..9, so 10 options.

Total divisors: 4 * 6 * 8 * 10 = 192.

Now, the divisors `n` such that `m^2 = n` divide the product are perfect squares, i.e., divisors with all prime exponents even.

Number of perfect square divisors: For each prime, the exponents are-even from 0 up to the maximum exponent:

- For `2^3`: possible even exponents are 0 and 2 → 2 options.
- For `3^5`: even exponents 0, 2, 4 → 3 options.
- For `5^7`: 0, 2, 4, 6 → 4 options.
- For `7^9`: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 → 5 options.

Total perfect square divisors: 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.

The set of such `n` has size 120, hence the answer is 120.

Final answer in Lean:
