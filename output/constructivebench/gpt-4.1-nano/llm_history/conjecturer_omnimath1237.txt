The pattern of moments suggests a relation to the roots x, y and their symmetric sums. Based on previous moment data and polynomial identities, the fifth moment can be expressed in terms of moments up to the fourth. The pattern indicates that the answer is a linear combination of previous moments, fitting a recurrence.

Answer: <<<11>>>
