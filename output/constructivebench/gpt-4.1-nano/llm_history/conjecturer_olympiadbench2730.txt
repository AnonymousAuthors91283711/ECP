The sequence is arithmetic: a(n) = a(1) + (n - 1) * d, with specified values at n=16, 30. Solving for d: 20 - 13 = 7, so d=1/2. Adjust to integer sequence implies a pattern involving 2n + constant. Final T-value corresponds to a linear function in n, matching the pattern in enumerations: the sequence increases by 1 each step (d=1). The index where a(k)=T is then k = T + 1, matching the pattern observed.
