Based on the pattern that each vertex connects to at least 3 edges and degrees differ at most 1, and considering the given total edges, the maximum number of vertices is approximately proportional to the number of edges. The bound is approximately \(k \approx \frac{2 \times 2022}{3}\). 

Final answer in Lean form:

<<<(2 * 2022) / 3>>>
