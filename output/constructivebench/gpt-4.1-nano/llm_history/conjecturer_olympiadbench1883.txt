The sequence F is the Fibonacci sequence. The set S must contain at least the Fibonacci numbers from 2 to n since differences of elements correspond to Fibonacci numbers. The minimal size m is achieved when S contains exactly these Fibonacci numbers mapped within the range. As Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, the set size needed is approximately the number of Fibonacci numbers ≤ n. The count grows like log base φ (φ = (1 + √5)/2) of n, roughly proportional to log₂(n). Simplification suggests the minimal m is proportional to n, approximating with linear growth. Final answer in closed form is n + 1.
