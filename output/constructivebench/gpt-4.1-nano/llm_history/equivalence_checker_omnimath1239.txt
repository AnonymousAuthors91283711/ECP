theorem omnimath1239 (a b c : ℤ) :
    gcd (X^2 + C a * X + C b) (X^2 + C b * X + C c) = X + C 1 ∧
    lcm (X^2 + C a * X + C b) (X^2 + C b * X + C c) = X^3 - C 4 * X^2 + X + C 6
    ↔ a + b + c = omnimath1239_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: -6
Proposed Answer: 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding conditions on integers a, b, c such that two quadratic polynomials have gcd (X + 1) and lcm (X³ - 4X² + X + 6).

2. The ground truth answer is -6, meaning a + b + c = -6 is the condition.

3. The proposed answer is 3, meaning a + b + c = 3.

4. These are clearly different conditions (-6 ≠ 3).

5. The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the ground truth.

<<<False>>>
