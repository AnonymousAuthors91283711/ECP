Ground Truth Answer: 273
Proposed Answer: 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the sum of squares of all real numbers x that satisfy a system of equations with y and z.

2. The system involves:
   - Linear equation (x + y + z = 1)
   - Sum of squares (x² + y² + z² = 2)
   - Sum of cubes (x³ + y³ + z³ = 3)

3. Using symmetric polynomial identities, we can find that x, y, z are roots of the polynomial t³ - t² - t/2 - 1/6 = 0.

4. The sum of squares of the roots (x² + y² + z²) is given by (x+y+z)² - 2(xy+yz+zx) = 1 - 2*(-1/2) = 2, which matches the given condition.

5. The ground truth answer 273 comes from more detailed calculations involving higher powers and multiple roots.

6. The proposed answer 3 is incorrect as it doesn't match the detailed calculation required for this problem.
