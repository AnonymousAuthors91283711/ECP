  Nat.card {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ Nat.Prime (n^2 - 3*n + 2)} = P2002AMCB_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given prime condition \( n^2 - 3n + 2 \) factors as \( (n-1)(n-2) \), prime when one factor is 1 and the other prime. For \( n > 2 \), both factors are ≥1, so only \( n=2 \) or \( n=3 \) satisfy. Both give composite, so only \( n=1 \) or \( n=2 \). \( n=1 \) yields \( -0 \), not prime, so only \( n=2 \).
