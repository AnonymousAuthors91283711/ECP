noncomputable abbrev omnimath1339_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1339
: sSup {k : ℝ | ∃ x > 0, ∃ y > 0, k^2 * (x^2/y^2 + y^2/x^2) + k * (x/y + y/x) = 3} = omnimath1339_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The expression simplifies to maximum value when the terms are balanced, suggesting \(k = 1\) and \(x / y = 1\), minimizing the sum of the reciprocals. Given symmetry and the nature of such optimization problems, the supremum occurs at \(k = 1\).
