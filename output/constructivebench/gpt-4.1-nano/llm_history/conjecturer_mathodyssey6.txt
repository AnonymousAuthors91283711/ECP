The solutions satisfy quadratic equations based on the constraints. Patterns suggest the smallest n for which both 3n+1 and 5n+1 are perfect squares. Checking small values reveals n = 2 (k=3, m=3), which makes 3*2+1=7 and 5*2+1=11, not perfect squares. Next, n=8 yields 3*8+1=25, which is 5^2, and 5*8+1=41, not a perfect square. n=18 gives 3*18+1=55, not a perfect square, but n=50 yields 3*50+1=151, not a square either, but n=6 gives 3*6+1=19, no. The only candidate found is at n=2 where both are squares: 3*2+1=7 (not a square), so reevaluate. The minimal pattern corresponds to n=... (optimal n based on pattern analysis). Given the pattern, minimal solution n=2 satisfies the least n. Therefore, answer = 2.

The goal is to find the minimal natural number \( n \ge 2 \) such that there exist natural numbers \( k, m \) satisfying \( 3n + 1 = k^2 \) and \( 5n + 1 = m^2 \). 

From the two equations:
1. \( 3n + 1 = k^2 \)
2. \( 5n + 1 = m^2 \)

Subtracting the first from the second:
\[
(5n + 1) - (3n + 1) = m^2 - k^2 \Rightarrow 2n = (m - k)(m + k)
\]

Given the structure: \( 2n = (m - k)(m + k) \) with \( 3n + 1 = k^2 \) and \( 5n + 1 = m^2 \), the minimal such \( n \) appears at the lowest solutions satisfying both.

Let's test small \( n \):

- For \( n=2 \), \( 3*2+1=7 \not\) perfect square, discard.
- For \( n=3 \), \( 3*3+1=10 \not\) perfect square.
- Continue until the first \( n \) that yields perfect squares for both.

Alternatively, find solutions systematically:

From \( 3n+1=k^2 \Rightarrow n = \frac{k^2 - 1}{3} \). For \( n \) integer, \( k^2 \equiv 1 \pmod 3 \). Since squares modulo 3 are 0 or 1, and \( 1 \pmod 3 \), so \( k^2 \equiv 1 \pmod 3 \), which is always true for \( k \equiv 1 \text{ or } 2 \pmod 3 \). 

Similarly, \( n = \frac{m^2 - 1}{5} \). For \( n \) integer, \( m^2 \equiv 1 \pmod 5 \). Squares modulo 5 are 0, 1, 4, so \( m^2 \equiv 1 \pmod 5 \Rightarrow m \equiv \pm 1 \pmod 5 \).

Furthermore, equate the expressions:

\[
\frac{k^2 - 1}{3} = \frac{m^2 - 1}{5} \Rightarrow 5(k^2 - 1) = 3(m^2 - 1)
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
5k^2 - 5 = 3m^2 - 3
\]
\[
5k^2 - 3m^2 = 2
\]

Now, the minimal positive integral solutions to \( 5k^2 - 3m^2 = 2 \) will give minimal \( n \).

Test small \( m \).

- \( m=1 \), \( 3*1^2=3 \), check if \( 5k^2 = 2 + 3 = 5 \Rightarrow k^2=1 \Rightarrow k= \pm 1 \).

Corresponds to:

\[
k^2 = 1 \Rightarrow 3n+1=1 \Rightarrow 3n=0 \Rightarrow n=0
\]
but \( n \ge 2 \), so discard.

Next \( m=2 \):

\[
5k^2=2+3*4=2+12=14 \Rightarrow k^2=14/5=2.8 \not\in \mathbb{Z}
\]

\( m=3 \):

\[
5k^2=2+3*9=2+27=29 \Rightarrow k^2=29/5=5.8 \not\in \mathbb{Z}
\]

\( m=4 \):

\[
5k^2=2+3*16=2+48=50 \Rightarrow k^2=10 \not\in \mathbb{Z}
\]

\( m=5 \):

\[
5k^2=2+3*25=2+75=77 \Rightarrow k^2=77/5=15.4
\]

No.

\( m=6 \):

\[
5k^2=2+3*36=2+108=110 \Rightarrow k^2=22
\]

No.

\( m=7 \):

\[
5k^2=2+3*49=2+147=149 \Rightarrow k^2=149/5=29.8
\]

No.

\( m=8 \):

\[
5k^2=2+3*64=2+192=194 \Rightarrow k^2=38.8
\]

No.

\( m=9 \):

\[
5k^2=2+3*81=2+243=245 \Rightarrow k^2=49
\]

Yes! \( k^2=49 \Rightarrow k=7 \)

Now, compute \( n \):

\[
3n+1=k^2=49 \Rightarrow 3n=48 \Rightarrow n=16
\]

Verify the other:

\[
5n+1=m^2=81 \Rightarrow 5n=80 \Rightarrow n=16
\]

Consistent! And \( n=16 \ge 2 \).

Thus, the minimal \( n \) satisfying the conditions is \( 16 \).

Given this, the answer is \( n=16 \).

Therefore, the answer in Lean is simply 16, as it is the minimal solution.
