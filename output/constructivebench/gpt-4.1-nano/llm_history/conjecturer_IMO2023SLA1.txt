The problem resembles a combination of a sum and a bounded deviation, hinting toward a bound involving the total sum and maximal deviations. From the enumerated answers and pattern, the minimal achievable deviation appears linked to the square root of the total sum scaled suitably, consistent with variance-related bounds.

<<<sqrt 100>>>

This is a plausible closed-form answer, matching the sum total of 100 and typical deviation bounds.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The primary issue is that `sqrt 100` (which is `Real.sqrt 100`) is a noncomputable constant in Lean, because `Real.sqrt` is marked as `noncomputable`. To fix this, we need to declare `IMO2023SLA1_answer` as `noncomputable`. 

Furthermore, since `sqrt 100` simplifies to 10 in ℝ, and the problem uses an approximation bound involving this value, the elegant and straightforward choice is to set `IMO2023SLA1_answer` as `10`. This avoids the need for `noncomputable` annotation and simplifies the proof.

**Summary of reasoning:**
- `sqrt 100 = 10` in ℝ.
- To avoid noncomputability issues, directly assign `10`.

**Final calculation:**
```lean
abbrev IMO2023SLA1_answer : ℝ := 10
```

**Explanation:**
Using `10` directly as the bound aligns with the fact that the square root of 100 is 10, and ensures the code compiles cleanly without additional noncomputability annotations. The choice is consistent with the expected answer type and the problem's scope.

The error arises because the declaration `abbrev IMO2023SLA1_answer : ℝ := 10` is incorrect in its syntax and structure. Using `abbrev` inside the assignment is invalid; instead, we should directly define `IMO2023SLA1_answer` as an `ℝ` constant with a numerical value.

Given the pattern from the enumerated answers, the intended value appears to be 10. Since the problem asks for a closed-form answer in ℝ that works as an upper bound or a meaningful constant, setting it to 10 is reasonable and maintains simplicity.

Final answer:

<<<10>>>

This concise constant can be used in proofs to indicate an explicit numerical bound, satisfying the problem's requirement for a tangible, closed-form answer.
