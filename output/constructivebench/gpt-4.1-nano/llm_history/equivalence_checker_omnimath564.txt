Ground Truth Answer: {5, 37}
Proposed Answer: { n : ℕ | n > 1 ∧ (n - 1) ∣ 144 ∧ IsSquare (n + 8 + 144 / (n - 1)) }
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all natural numbers n > 1 such that (n² + 7n + 136)/(n-1) is a perfect square.

2. The ground truth answer gives specific solutions: {5, 37}

3. The proposed answer provides a condition: n > 1, (n-1) divides 144, and n + 8 + 144/(n-1) is a perfect square.

Let's verify if the proposed condition is equivalent to finding the solutions:

First, let's rewrite the original expression:
(n² + 7n + 136)/(n-1) = (n² - n + 8n + 136)/(n-1) = n + 8 + 144/(n-1)

So the condition becomes: n + 8 + 144/(n-1) must be a perfect square, and (n-1) must divide 144 (to make the term integer).

This matches exactly with the proposed answer's condition. 

Now let's check if this gives the same solutions:
We need to find all n > 1 where (n-1) divides 144. The divisors of 144 are numerous, but we can check which ones satisfy the perfect square condition.

Testing n=5: (5-1)=4 divides 144, and 5 + 8 + 144/4 = 5+8+36=49 which is 7²
Testing n=37: (37-1)=36 divides 144, and 37 + 8 + 144/36 = 37+8+4=49 which is 7²

Other divisors either don't satisfy n>1 or don't make the expression a perfect square.

Therefore, the proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer.
