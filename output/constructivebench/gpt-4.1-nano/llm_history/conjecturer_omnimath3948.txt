Given the functional equation f(f x) + f(f y) = f(x + y) * f(x y) and the condition f(0) ≠ 0, the solutions are constant functions (since substituting x=0 simplifies to equations implying f is constant). The only non-zero constant functions satisfy the condition f(0) ≠ 0.

Thus, the set contains functions: f(x) = c where c ≠ 0.

The current proposal contains an explanatory paragraph, which is invalid syntax in Lean. Instead, the answer should be a Lean expression describing the set of solutions explicitly, likely in terms of functions that are constant with a non-zero value.

By analyzing the functional equation and condition, we deduce that functions satisfying the equation are constant functions, since substituting x=0 implies that f is constant, and the condition f(0) ≠ 0 restricts us to constant functions c where c ≠ 0.

Hence, the set is all functions f : ℝ → ℝ such that ∀ x, f x = c for some c ≠ 0.

Final answer in Lean syntax:

<<<{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, c ≠ 0 ∧ ∀ x, f x = c}>>>
