Ground Truth Answer: fun k => if k = 0 ∨ k = 1 ∨ k = -1 then 0 else 2
Proposed Answer: fun k : ℤ => if k = 0 then 0 else 2
Let me analyze the problem and compare the answers:

1. The problem is about determining when two sets in ℝ² are disjoint:
   - A circle: x² + y² = k²
   - A hyperbola: x*y = k

2. The ground truth answer correctly identifies that:
   - When k=0, both sets degenerate (circle becomes point, hyperbola becomes axes) and intersect at origin
   - When k=±1, the sets are tangent (they touch at exactly one point each)
   - For all other integer k, the sets are disjoint (hence output 2)

3. The proposed answer only handles k=0 case correctly, but misses the k=±1 cases where the sets are not disjoint (they touch at one point each).

The proposed answer is incorrect for k=±1 cases, so they are not equivalent.
