Ground Truth Answer: 135
Proposed Answer: 144
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves a sequence of 126 characters (6 X's, 24 Y's, and 96 X's).
2. We need to check which of the numbers [9, 18, 36, 72] satisfy the condition that in the first n characters:
   - Either count of X's is twice count of Y's, or
   - Count of Y's is twice count of X's
3. Then sum the valid numbers from the list.

Let's verify each number:
- For n=9: 6 X's and 3 Y's → 6 = 2*3 → valid
- For n=18: 6 X's and 12 Y's → 12 = 2*6 → valid
- For n=36: 6 X's + 24 Y's + 6 X's → 12 X's and 24 Y's → 24 = 2*12 → valid
- For n=72: 6 X's + 24 Y's + 42 X's → 48 X's and 24 Y's → 48 = 2*24 → valid

Sum of valid numbers: 9 + 18 + 36 + 72 = 135

The ground truth answer is correct (135), while the proposed answer (144) is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
