theorem P2005AMCB_1 : 
  (1000 / 2) * 1 - (1000 / 5) * 2 = P2005AMCB_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests a formula involving integer divisions and linear coefficients. Simplifying directly: (1000 / 2) * 1 - (1000 / 5) * 2 = 500 * 1 - 200 * 2 = 500 - 400 = 100. To generalize, final answer:  n/2 - 2*(n/5). For n=1000: 1000/2 - 2*(1000/5).  
Answer: <<< (1000 / 2) - 2 * (1000 / 5) >>>
