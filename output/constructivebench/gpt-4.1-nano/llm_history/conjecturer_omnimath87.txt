Given the functional equation and the pattern in enumeration, the solutions are linear functions with particular constraints. The solutions are of the form \(f(x) = 0\) or \(f(x) = c x\) where \(c \ge 0\). Therefore, the set of solutions is: the zero function and all functions \(f(x) = c x\) with \(c \ge 0\).  

Final answer: <<< {f : ℝ → ℝ | f = (λ x, 0)} ∪ {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c ≥ 0, f = (λ x, c * x)} >>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The main issue is the use of comma ',' instead of '↦' in the set comprehension. In Lean, for set definitions involving conditions, the syntax is {f | condition} where the condition is a logical statement. Here, the function equalities should use '↦' (or '->') to define functions explicitly, and the set builder should be expressed as {f : ℝ → ℝ | ... } with logical conditions.

Moreover, the union '∪' cannot be used directly within the set comprehension syntax. Instead, the union of two sets can be described as {f : ℝ → ℝ | condition₁ ∨ condition₂}.

Based on the enumerated answer, the conclusive solution set comprises functions identically zero, and linear functions of the form f(x) = c * x where c ≥ 0.

Therefore, the final answer, as a set of functions, should be represented as f : ℝ → ℝ satisfying either:

- f(x) = 0 for all x, or
- ∃ c ≥ 0, f(x) = c * x.

Expressed correctly, the set can be written as:

{f : ℝ → ℝ | (∀ x, f x = 0) ∨ (∃ c ≥ 0, ∀ x, f x = c * x)}.

However, to be concise, since the constant-zero function is a special linear function with c=0, we can unify these under the set of all functions of the form f(x) = c * x where c ≥ 0 (since zero is included), plus the zero function.

Alternatively, the zero function is included as c=0, so the set is:

{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c ≥ 0, ∀ x, f x = c * x }.

This covers both zero function (c=0) and positive linear functions.

Final answer:

<<<{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c ≥ 0, ∀ x, f x = c * x}>>>
