abbrev omnimath3392_answer : â„š := sorry
theorem omnimath3392 :
  (1 - 1 / 3) * (1 - 1 / 4) * (1 - 1 / 5) = omnimath3392_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2 / 5
Proposed Answer: (2 / 3) * (3 / 4) * (4 / 5)
Let's analyze the problem and answers step by step:

1. The problem asks to evaluate the product (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/4) * (1 - 1/5)
2. Calculating each term:
   - (1 - 1/3) = 2/3
   - (1 - 1/4) = 3/4
   - (1 - 1/5) = 4/5
3. The proposed answer shows exactly these intermediate steps: (2/3) * (3/4) * (4/5)
4. Now let's compute the final value:
   - (2/3)*(3/4) = 6/12 = 1/2
   - (1/2)*(4/5) = 4/10 = 2/5
5. The ground truth answer is 2/5, which matches the final computation.

The proposed answer shows the correct intermediate steps that lead to the ground truth answer. While it doesn't show the final simplification, it's mathematically equivalent since the simplification leads to the same result.
