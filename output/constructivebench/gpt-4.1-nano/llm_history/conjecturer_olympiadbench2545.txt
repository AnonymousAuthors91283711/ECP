Given the condition c = k * d and c + d = 2000, rewriting yields d(k + 1) = 2000. Since d divides 2000, for each positive divisor d of 2000, k = (2000/d) - 1 is a non-negative integer when 2000/d ≥ 1, i.e., for all positive divisors of 2000. Thus, the count is the number of positive divisors of 2000.

The number of positive divisors of 2000 is 16, as 2000 factors as 2^4 * 5^3, which yields (4 + 1) * (3 + 1) = 20. Adjusting for the condition d ≥ 1 and counting the solutions, the total solutions correspond to the divisors.

Answer: the number of positive divisors of 2000.

Hence, in Lean, this is:

<<<(2 ^ 4) * (3 + 1)>>>
