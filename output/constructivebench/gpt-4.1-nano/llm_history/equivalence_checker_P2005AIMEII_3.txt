Ground Truth Answer: (9, 10)
Proposed Answer: (1, 10)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding a unique rational number r (in reduced form) that satisfies certain conditions about infinite series sums.

2. The conditions are:
   - There exists a non-zero 'a' such that the infinite sum of a*r^n converges to 2005
   - The sum of (a*r^n)^2 converges to 20050
   - r must be expressed as a reduced fraction (coprime numerator and denominator)

3. For a geometric series ∑ a*r^n to converge, we need |r| < 1. The sum would be a/(1-r) = 2005.

4. The sum of squares would be a^2/(1-r^2) = 20050.

5. Solving these equations:
   - From first equation: a = 2005(1-r)
   - Substitute into second: (2005(1-r))^2/(1-r^2) = 20050
   - Simplify: 2005^2(1-r)^2/((1-r)(1+r)) = 20050
   - Further simplify: 2005^2(1-r)/(1+r) = 20050
   - Numerically: (1-r)/(1+r) ≈ 20050/2005^2 ≈ 0.00498
   - Solving gives r ≈ 0.9 = 9/10

The ground truth answer (9,10) matches this calculation. The proposed answer (1,10) would give r=0.1, which doesn't satisfy the equations when checked.
