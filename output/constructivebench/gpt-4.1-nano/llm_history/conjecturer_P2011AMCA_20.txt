Based on the pattern that quadratic functions and their values at large points relate to the leading coefficient, the key is to analyze f 100 = a * 100^2 + b * 100 + c, with a, b, c satisfying the constraints and the initial value f 1 = 0. The inequalities suggest f 7 and f 8 are roughly between 50 and 80, implying a quadratic with moderate positive leading coefficient. The dependance on the scale 5000 * k indicates that for large x, f x ≈ a x^2, so f 100 ≈ a * 10,000. Given the bounds of f 100, we derive k ≈ f 100 / 5000. From the data, the approximate value of f 100 is just above 20*5000, giving k ≈ 20. Therefore, the unique k is 20.
