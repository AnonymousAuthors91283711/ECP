The pattern suggests the variables are related to ratios involving constants 3/4, 5/12, and 21/20, which resemble parts of right triangles with specific ratios. To guess the pattern, consider (a, b, c) as solutions to these symmetric formulas, likely matching these ratios. Testing common special values yields a consistent guess that a = 1. Finalized, the solution simplifies to a fixed value suggested by these ratios.
