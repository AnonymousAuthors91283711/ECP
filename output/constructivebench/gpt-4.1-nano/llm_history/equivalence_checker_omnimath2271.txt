Ground Truth Answer: (991, 997, 1009)
Proposed Answer: (89, 97, 103)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for three distinct prime numbers p < q < r such that p*q*r = 989*1001*1007 + 320.

2. First, let's compute the right side:
   989*1001*1007 + 320 = (1000-11)(1000+1)(1000+7) + 320
   = (1000²-10*1000-11)(1000+7) + 320
   = (990000-11)(1007) + 320
   = 989989 * 1007 + 320 ≈ 997*1000*1000 ≈ 997,000,000

3. Now compute the proposed answer:
   89 * 97 * 103 = 89 * (100-3)(100+3) = 89 * (10000-9) = 890000 - 801 = 889,199
   This is much smaller than 997,000,000, so it's incorrect.

4. The ground truth answer:
   991 * 997 * 1009 ≈ 1000 * 1000 * 1000 ≈ 1,000,000,000
   This is closer to our estimate, and indeed:
   991*997 = (1000-9)(1000-3) = 1,000,000 - 12,000 + 27 = 988,027
   988,027 * 1009 = 988,027 * (1000 + 9) = 988,027,000 + 8,892,243 = 996,919,243
   996,919,243 + 320 = 996,919,563
   And 991*997*1009 = 996,919,243
   The +320 seems to be a red herring or typo in the problem, but the ground truth answer gives the correct product.
