The recurrence suggests an increasing sequence with the form `an+1 = 2 (an + 1/an) - 3`. The limit converges when the sequence stabilizes; solving the fixed point `L = 2 (L + 1/L) - 3` yields `L = 1`. Since `an` is increasing, initial value `a` must be at most this limit. Therefore, the answer set corresponds to all real numbers `a` less than 1.
