abbrev omnimath710_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath710 : 
  omnimath710_answer ^ 4 = 5508^3 + 5625^3 + 5742^3 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 855
Proposed Answer: (5508 * 5625 * 5742)^(1 / 4)
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem asks for a natural number n such that n⁴ equals the sum of three cubes (5508³ + 5625³ + 5742³).

2. The ground truth answer is 855, which means 855⁴ should equal 5508³ + 5625³ + 5742³ (and it does, as verified by calculation).

3. The proposed answer is (5508 * 5625 * 5742)^(1/4), which is:
   - Not a natural number (it's approximately 5624.99)
   - Not equal to 855
   - Not even calculating the correct quantity (it's using product instead of sum of cubes)

The proposed answer is completely incorrect both in approach and result. It's not equivalent to the ground truth answer.
