abbrev P2003AMCA_10_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2003AMCA_10 :
  let total := 3 + 2 + 1
  let first_take := 3 / total
  let remaining_after_first := 1 - first_take
  let second_take := 2 / total * remaining_after_first
  let remaining_after_second := remaining_after_first - second_take
  let third_take := 1 / total * remaining_after_second
  let unclaimed := 1 - (first_take + second_take + third_take)
  unclaimed = P2003AMCA_10_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The process allocates portions proportionally: first 3/6, then 2/6*remaining, then 1/6*remaining; summing up, remaining unclaimed is 0. The total assigned is 1, so unclaimed is zero.
