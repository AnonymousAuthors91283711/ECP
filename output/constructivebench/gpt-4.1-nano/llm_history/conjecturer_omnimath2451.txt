The problem asks for the number of 5-element subsets of a certain set of 6-element finsets, with each subset satisfying a parity condition on intersections. The pattern from enumeration hints at choosing 4 elements out of 6 for the smallest such set, so the answer likely reflects a binomial coefficient.
