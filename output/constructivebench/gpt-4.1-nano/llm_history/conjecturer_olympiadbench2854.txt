Given the relation involving arctan and the sum, the problem reduces to solving an algebraic equation in x. The pattern indicates that the answer involves a rational expression derived from tangent addition formulas.  
From the hint, the pattern aligns with the tangent sum formulas:  
\[ \tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B} \]  
Matching coefficients with the arctan expression suggests the answer for \(x^2\) is \(\frac{1}{7}\).  
Therefore, the final answer is:  

<<<(1 : ℝ) / 7>>>
