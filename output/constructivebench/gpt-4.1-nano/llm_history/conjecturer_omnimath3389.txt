The pattern suggests the sum telescopes to an expression involving powers of 2 and (sin x)^2. The second sum evaluates to a closed form combining geometric series. Based on the enumeration, the answer likely simplifies to a constant multiple of (sin x)^2 involving 2^parameter, matching the pattern: 2^{2011} * (sin x)^2.
