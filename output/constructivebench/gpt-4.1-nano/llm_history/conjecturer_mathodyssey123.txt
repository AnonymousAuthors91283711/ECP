The pattern suggests the sum of all elements in set A, where for each n in A, 2n+2 is in B and A, B are disjoint subsets of {0,...,20}. The constraints imply that A consists of numbers n where 2n+2 also belongs to B, maintaining disjointness. The largest such sum occurs when A contains the minimal n's, i.e., 0 to 10, since 2 * 10 + 2 = 22 > 20 (not in B). Thus, A = {0,1,2,...,10}. Sum = sum of first 11 natural numbers.

Final answer:
<<<(10 * 11) / 2>>>
