Ground Truth Answer: {(3, 2), (-3, 2), (3, -2), (-3, -2)}
Proposed Answer: { (K, L) | ∃ x y : ℤ, K = x + y ∧ L = 2 * x - y }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for all integer pairs (K, L) that satisfy K² + 3L² = 5² + 4² - 5*4 = 25 + 16 - 20 = 21.

2. The ground truth answer provides 4 specific solutions that satisfy this equation:
   (3,2): 9 + 12 = 21
   (-3,2): 9 + 12 = 21
   (3,-2): 9 + 12 = 21
   (-3,-2): 9 + 12 = 21

3. The proposed answer gives a parametric form for (K, L) in terms of x and y. However, this parametric form doesn't guarantee that K² + 3L² = 21. For example:
   - If x=1, y=1: K=2, L=1 → 4 + 3 = 7 ≠ 21
   - If x=2, y=-1: K=1, L=5 → 1 + 75 = 76 ≠ 21

The proposed answer is describing a general form that includes many pairs that don't satisfy the equation, while the ground truth answer gives exactly the pairs that do satisfy it. They are not equivalent.
