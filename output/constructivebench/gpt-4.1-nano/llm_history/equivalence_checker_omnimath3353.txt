noncomputable abbrev omnimath3353_answer : ℂ := sorry
theorem omnimath3353 :
  2 * Complex.cos (Real.log 2009 * Complex.I) ^ 2 + Complex.I * Complex.sin (Real.log 4036081 * Complex.I) = omnimath3353_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 4036082 / 4036081
Proposed Answer: (4036081 - 2009) * Complex.exp (Real.log (2009 * 4036081) * Complex.I) / 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves complex trigonometric functions and logarithms. The key is to simplify the left side of the equation to match the right side.

2. Ground Truth Answer is a simple fraction: 4036082 / 4036081

3. Proposed Answer is a more complex expression involving exponentials and logs.

Let's evaluate the proposed answer:
- 4036081 = 2009² (since 2009² = 2009 × 2009 = 4036081)
- So 4036081 - 2009 = 2009² - 2009 = 2009(2009 - 1) = 2009 × 2008
- The denominator is 2
- The exponential term is Complex.exp (Real.log (2009 × 4036081) * Complex.I)

The proposed answer doesn't simplify to the ground truth answer of 4036082/4036081. The forms are fundamentally different - one is a pure rational number, the other involves complex exponentials.
