The error in your lean code is due to the line defining P2010AIMEI_4_answer. The syntax '7, 36' is invalid for defining a tuple in Lean; instead, you need to use parentheses: `(7, 36)`. 

Furthermore, your current code attempts to define the answer with 'abbrev', which is fine, but ensure the entire tuple is correctly enclosed, and that the syntax errors are fixed.

Given the enumerated hints and the current answer, my conjecture is that the correct answer should be a tuple `(..., ...)`. Since the given answer is '7, 36', the fixed code line should be: 

```lean
abbrev P2010AIMEI_4_answer : ℕ × ℕ := (7, 36)
```

This matches Lean syntax for tuples, and aligns with the provided answer hint.

<<<(7, 36)>>>

This fix corrects the syntax and should compile, assuming the rest of the code is proper. The value `'7'` and `'36'` are likely derived from the probability calculations, and their coprimality is straightforward to verify.
