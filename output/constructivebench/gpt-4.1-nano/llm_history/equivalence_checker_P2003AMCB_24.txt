Ground Truth Answer: 1002
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number c such that there exist numbers a < b < c where the system of equations has exactly one real solution x.

2. The ground truth answer is 1002, which suggests this is a non-trivial problem requiring careful analysis of the equations.

3. The proposed answer is 4, which seems too small considering the nature of the problem and the ground truth answer.

4. For c=4, the possible pairs (a,b) would be (1,2), (1,3), or (2,3). It's unlikely these would satisfy the uniqueness condition for the system of equations.

5. The large discrepancy between 4 and 1002 suggests these are not equivalent answers.
