Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

The problem presents a recursive expectation equation:
E = 1 + p_H*E + p_M*(1 + p_H*E + p_M*0 + p_T*E) + p_T*E
with probabilities:
p_H = 1/4, p_M = 1/2, p_T = 1/4

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Expand the equation:
E = 1 + (1/4)E + (1/2)[1 + (1/4)E + 0 + (1/4)E] + (1/4)E

2. Simplify inside the brackets:
E = 1 + (1/4)E + (1/2)[1 + (1/2)E] + (1/4)E

3. Distribute the (1/2):
E = 1 + (1/4)E + 1/2 + (1/4)E + (1/4)E

4. Combine like terms:
E = (1 + 1/2) + (1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4)E
E = 3/2 + (3/4)E

5. Solve for E:
E - (3/4)E = 3/2
(1/4)E = 3/2
E = (3/2)*4 = 6

The ground truth answer is indeed 6, while the proposed answer is 2. These are not equivalent.
