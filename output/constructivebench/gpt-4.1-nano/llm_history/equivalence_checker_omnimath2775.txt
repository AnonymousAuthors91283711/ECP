Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => 2 * x + y + 2015
Proposed Answer: fun x y => (2020 * (x + y)) / 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence a(n) with base cases a(1)=x and a(3)=y, and a recurrence relation for n>1: a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n+1) - 1.

2. We need to find the sum of the first 2018 terms of this sequence.

3. The ground truth answer is 2x + y + 2015, which is a linear combination of x and y plus a constant.

4. The proposed answer is (2020*(x + y))/2 = 1010*(x + y), which is a different linear combination.

The proposed answer is clearly different from the ground truth answer. For example:
- If x=1, y=1: ground truth gives 2*1 + 1 + 2015 = 2018, while proposed gives 1010*(1+1)=2020
- If x=0, y=0: ground truth gives 2015, proposed gives 0

These test cases show the answers are not equivalent.
