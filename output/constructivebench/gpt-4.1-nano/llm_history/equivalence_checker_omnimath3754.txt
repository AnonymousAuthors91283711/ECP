theorem omnimath3754 :
  {(n, p) : ℕ × ℕ | n > 0 ∧ p > 0 ∧ Nat.Prime p ∧ (∑ i ∈ Finset.Icc 1 n, i = 3 * ∑ j ∈ Finset.Icc 1 p, j ^ 2)} = omnimath3754_answer ↔ True := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(5, 2)}
Proposed Answer: { np : ℕ × ℕ | 0 < np.2 ∧ Nat.Prime np.2 ∧ np.1 ≥ np.2 }
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is asking for pairs (n,p) where:
   - n > 0 and p > 0
   - p is prime
   - The sum of first n natural numbers equals 3 times the sum of squares of first p natural numbers

2. The ground truth answer gives exactly one solution: (5,2)
   - Sum of first 5 naturals: 1+2+3+4+5 = 15
   - Sum of squares of first 2 naturals: 1+4 = 5
   - 3*5 = 15, which matches

3. The proposed answer is much broader:
   - It includes all pairs where p is positive prime and n ≥ p
   - This would include many invalid pairs like (2,2), (3,3), (5,3), etc.
   - Only (5,2) satisfies the original equation from the ground truth

The proposed answer is incorrect as it includes many pairs that don't satisfy the original equation and doesn't specifically identify the correct solution.
