The pattern suggests that the solutions involve expressions related to quadratic solutions derived from y, where y is an integer with |y| ≥ 2. The standard form resembles the roots of quadratic equations x^2 - yx + 1 = 0, which have solutions (y ± √(y² - 4))/2. Since the original problem involves x^n + x^(-n) and the roots relate to these quadratic solutions, a normalized form for the answer can be:

<<<fun y : ℤ => (y - Real.sqrt (y^2 - 4)) / 2>>>
