Given the divisibility condition \( (n^3 + 3) \mid (n^2 + 7) \) and the enumerated values, the pattern suggests that solutions are specific small positive integers where the division holds. Checking values, solutions appear at \( n = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \). For larger \( n \), divisibility doesn't hold based on pattern analysis. Therefore, the general solution set is \( \{1, 2\} \).
