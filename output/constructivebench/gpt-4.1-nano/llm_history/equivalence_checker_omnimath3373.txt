Ground Truth Answer: [1/2, 1/3, 1/7, 1/42]
Proposed Answer: [1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/12]
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a list of 4 distinct rational numbers, each expressible as 1/(n+1) for some natural number n, that sum to 1.

2. Ground Truth Answer [1/2, 1/3, 1/7, 1/42]:
   - 1/2 = 1/(1+1)
   - 1/3 = 1/(2+1)
   - 1/7 = 1/(6+1)
   - 1/42 = 1/(41+1)
   - Sum: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/7 + 1/42 = 21/42 + 14/42 + 6/42 + 1/42 = 42/42 = 1
   - All conditions satisfied

3. Proposed Answer [1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/12]:
   - 1/2 = 1/(1+1)
   - 1/3 = 1/(2+1)
   - 1/4 = 1/(3+1)
   - 1/12 = 1/(11+1)
   - Sum: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/12 = 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 + 1/12 = 14/12 ≠ 1
   - Fails the sum condition

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the sum condition (14/12 ≠ 1), while the ground truth does. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
