theorem omnimath3199 (n : ℕ) (hn : n < 10^100) :
  n ∣ 2^n ∧ (n - 1) ∣ (2^n - 1) ∧ (n - 2) ∣ (2^n - 2) ↔ n ∈ omnimath3199_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests \( n \) is a divisor of \( 2^n \), \( n-1 \) divides \( 2^n - 1 \), and \( n-2 \) divides \( 2^n - 2 \). Known solutions for such divisibility relations often encapsulate \( n \in \{1, 3, 7\} \), with related numbers fitting the pattern. Abstracting and generalizing, the likely set includes \( n \) such that \( n \in \{1,3,7\} \) or related forms. The simplest closed form is these explicit elements. Given the patterns, a good candidate is:

<<<{1, 3, 7}>>>
