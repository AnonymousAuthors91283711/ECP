abbrev mathodyssey182_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem mathodyssey182 (x : ℝ) : 
  4 * (x + 4) = 24 + 3 * (2 * x - 2) ↔ x = mathodyssey182_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The equation: 4(x + 4) = 24 + 3(2x - 2). Simplify and solve for x: x = (4 * 4 - 24 + 3 * 2) / (4 - 3 * 2). Simplifies to x = 8/(-2) = -4. 

Final answer: <<<(-4: ℝ)>>>

This matches the pattern of the enumeration and eliminates the existential quantifier.
