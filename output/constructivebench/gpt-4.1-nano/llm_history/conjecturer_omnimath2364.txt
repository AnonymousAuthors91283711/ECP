abbrev omnimath2364_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2364 (θ : ℝ) :
  (∃! r, (sin θ) * r^2 + (cos θ + tan θ) * r + 1 = 0) ↔ sin θ ∈ omnimath2364_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
Since the quadratic in r has a unique solution only when its discriminant is zero, solve discriminant = 0: (cos θ + tan θ)^2 - 4 * (sin θ) * 1 = 0, simplifies to cos²θ + 2 cos θ tan θ + tan²θ - 4 sin θ = 0, leading to sin θ = cos θ, i.e., sin θ = ± cos θ.  
Thus, answer set is {sin θ | sin θ = ± cos θ} = {±1, 0}.  
Final expression:

<<<{x : ℝ | x = 0 ∨ x = 1 ∨ x = -1}>>>
