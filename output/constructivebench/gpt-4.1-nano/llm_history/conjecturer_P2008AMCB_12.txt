theorem P2008AMCB_12 (seq : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ n, 0 < n → (∑ k in Finset.range n, seq k) / n = n) → seq 2008 = P2008AMCB_12_answer 2008 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The pattern suggests the sequence sums to n^3, so seq 2008 ~ n^3 / n = n^2. The specific sequence is likely linear in n, with sequence value n^2. Therefore, the simplified answer is n^2.

<<<fun n => n * n>>>
