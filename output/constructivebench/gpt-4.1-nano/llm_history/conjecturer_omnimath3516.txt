theorem omnimath3516 : 
  100 * (120 / 100) * (150 / 100) = omnimath3516_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the computation: 100 * (120 / 100) * (150 / 100), which simplifies to 100 * 1.2 * 1.5 = 180. The answer is an integer, so the exact value is 180. No need for extra quantifiers. 

<<<180>>>
