Ground Truth Answer: {1, 3}
Proposed Answer: {n | ∃ k : ℕ, n = k * k}
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is asking for which positive natural numbers n we can arrange its divisors in a sequence where the sum of every initial segment is a perfect square.

The ground truth answer is {1, 3}, meaning only 1 and 3 satisfy this condition.

The proposed answer is {n | ∃ k : ℕ, n = k * k}, meaning all perfect squares satisfy this condition.

Let's test this:
- For n=1 (perfect square): divisors [1], sums [1] - valid
- For n=4 (perfect square): divisors [1,2,4], possible arrangements:
  - [1,2,4] sums [1,3,7] - 3 not a square
  - [1,4,2] sums [1,5,7] - 5 not a square
  - etc. No arrangement works
- For n=3 (not perfect square): divisors [1,3], arrangement [3,1] sums [3,4] - both squares

The proposed answer incorrectly includes all perfect squares when in fact most don't work (like 4,9,16 etc.), and misses n=3 which does work.
