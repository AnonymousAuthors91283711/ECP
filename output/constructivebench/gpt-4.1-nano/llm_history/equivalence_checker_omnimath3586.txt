Ground Truth Answer: { (1 + Real.sqrt 5)/2, (1 - Real.sqrt 5)/2 }
Proposed Answer: {
  x : ℝ | x = (fib 2009 + Real.sqrt ((fib 2009)^2 - 4 * fib 2008)) / 2 ∨ x = (fib 2009 - Real.sqrt ((fib 2009)^2 - 4 * fib 2008)) / 2

<<<True>>>

Explanation: The ground truth answer gives the golden ratio and its conjugate as solutions, which are the roots of the characteristic equation for Fibonacci numbers. The proposed answer expresses the solutions in terms of Fibonacci numbers, but due to the identity fib(n+1)^2 - fib(n+2)*fib(n) = (-1)^n (Cassini's identity), the discriminant simplifies to 5. Thus, both forms are equivalent representations of the same solutions. The proposed answer is just a more general form that reduces to the ground truth when simplified.
