Given the symmetry in the exponential expressions, the key is to analyze when the equality holds and when the inequalities differ. Observing the pattern, the solutions are exactly the real numbers satisfying the equation, excluding the case where the exponentials are equal, i.e., avoiding the case \(x = x^2 = x^3\) unless those solutions satisfy the given properties. The solutions are \(x = 0\), 1, or satisfying \(x^2 = x, x^3 \neq x\); these are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1\). The set then is \{0, 1\}.
