The recurrence relation suggests a linear pattern, and initial conditions guide the formula. Given a 2-term recurrence and base values at 1 and 3, the sequence forms an arithmetic progression with quadratic correction. Simplification yields the closed form: y + x * (n - 1). For summation up to 2018, substituting n = 2018 + 1, the sum evaluates to (2018 + 1) * (x + y) / 2.  

Final answer: <<<fun x y => (2020 * (x + y)) / 2>>>
