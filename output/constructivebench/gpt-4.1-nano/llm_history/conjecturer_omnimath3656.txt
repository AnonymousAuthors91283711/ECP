The pattern suggests the only solutions are trivial or degenerate cases where the variables satisfy specific power relations. Given the prime p and the sum of two 2013th powers, the set of solutions is the single tuple corresponding to the trivial solution with a = b = p = 1 and n = 1.

The core issue is to define `omnimath3656_answer` as a set of quadruples `(a, b, p, n)` satisfying the equation `a^2013 + b^2013 = p^n` with given conditions, and to formalize this in Lean. The initial placeholder `sorry` causes errors because it is not an expression of the correct type. The second error indicates a problem with the membership statement in the defining equation, which is due to improper syntax or missing braces/parentheses.

Given the pattern in the problem and the enumeration hint, the intended set appears to consist of a single trivial solution `(1, 1, 1, 1)`. Formalizing this in Lean, the set should be defined explicitly with singleton notation.

Final answer:

<<<
{(a, b, p, n) | a = 1 ∧ b = 1 ∧ p = 1 ∧ n = 1}
