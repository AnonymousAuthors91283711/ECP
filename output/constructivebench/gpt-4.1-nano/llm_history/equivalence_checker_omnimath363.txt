Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2 * n - 1)!!
Proposed Answer: fun n => 2 ^ (n - 1)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding a closed-form expression for a sum of products of a sequence a with specific constraints.

2. The ground truth answer uses double factorial (!!), which for odd numbers means (2n-1)!! = 1×3×5×...×(2n-1).

3. The proposed answer gives 2^(n-1).

4. Let's test small values of n:
   - For n=1: 
     Ground truth: (2*1-1)!! = 1!! = 1
     Proposed: 2^(1-1) = 1
   - For n=2:
     Ground truth: (4-1)!! = 3!! = 3×1 = 3
     Proposed: 2^(2-1) = 2
   - For n=3:
     Ground truth: (6-1)!! = 5!! = 5×3×1 = 15
     Proposed: 2^(3-1) = 4

The answers diverge starting from n=2, and the difference grows larger as n increases.
