  100 * m + n = 108 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
The pattern suggests the fraction simplified in the product is 3/14 (from the factorization), and from the sum 100*m + n = 108, the pair (m, n) is (3, 14). The fraction’s numerator and denominator are coprime. The final answer fits the pattern:

<<<(3, 14)>>>
