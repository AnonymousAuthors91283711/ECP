Given the structure of the set involving log base 2, the problem partitions the unit square into regions where the integer part of the logarithm base 2 remains constant. For each q ∈ ℕ, the subset corresponds to points where 2^q ≤ p.1, p.2 < 2^{q+1}. The measure of each such region is (2^{q+1} - 2^q)^2 = (2^q)^2 = 4^{q}. Summing over all relevant q yields a geometric series. The total volume sums to 1, with a segment distribution proportional to 2^{2q}. The sum of the series equals 1/3.
