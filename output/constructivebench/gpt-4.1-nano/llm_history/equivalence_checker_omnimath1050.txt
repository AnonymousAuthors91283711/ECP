Ground Truth Answer: X ^ 2 - 5
Proposed Answer: -X^2 + 7*X - 6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives a polynomial P with known evaluations at x=1, x=2, and x=3.
2. We're asked to find P modulo (X^3 - 6X^2 + 11X - 6), which is equivalent to finding a quadratic polynomial that matches P at these three points since (X^3 - 6X^2 + 11X - 6) = (X-1)(X-2)(X-3).
3. The ground truth answer is X^2 - 5.
4. The proposed answer is -X^2 + 7X - 6.

Let's check both answers against the given conditions:

For X^2 - 5:
- eval at 1: 1 - 5 = -4 ✔
- eval at 2: 4 - 5 = -1 ✔
- eval at 3: 9 - 5 = 4 ✔

For -X^2 + 7X - 6:
- eval at 1: -1 + 7 - 6 = 0 ≠ -4 ✖
- eval at 2: -4 + 14 - 6 = 4 ≠ -1 ✖
- eval at 3: -9 + 21 - 6 = 6 ≠ 4 ✖

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy any of the given conditions, while the ground truth satisfies all. They are not equivalent.
