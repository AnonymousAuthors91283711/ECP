Given the pattern of the sequence of products with increasing d₁, the final term is the 8th such term, which suggests linear progression based on d₁, a₂, and a₁. The pattern in the values indicates the product grows approximately proportionally and increases steadily. Estimating based on the sequence, the final value is 2340.
