Looking at the pattern in the enumerated answers, the number seems to follow a form related to powers of 2, possibly scaled or shifted. Given the problem's structure and typical approaches, a plausible candidate is a power of 2 times a constant factor that, when expanded, matches the structure of the large number. Since the number is large and seems to be approximately on the order of 2^50, the answer is likely a simple power of 2 multiplied by a coefficient. The most straightforward such representation is \( 2^{50} \times 3 \). 

Hence, the answer in Lean representation is:

<<<3 * 2^50>>>
