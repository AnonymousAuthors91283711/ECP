  IsGreatest {N : ℕ | 0 < N ∧ ofDigits 10 (digits 7 N) = 2 * N} P2001AIMEI_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The set contains N such that the decimal digits of N are exactly '7' repeated twice, i.e., '77', which numerically equals 77, and satisfies 2*N = number of digits times 10^number of digits minus 1, simplifies to 77, which is \(7 \times 11\). The maximum N fulfilling the condition is 77.
