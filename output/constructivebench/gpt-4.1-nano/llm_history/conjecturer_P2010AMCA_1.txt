abbrev P2010AMCA_1_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2010AMCA_1 :
  (20 - (2010 - 201) + (2010 - (201 - 20) : ℝ) = P2010AMCA_1_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests evaluating the expression step-by-step: 20 - (2010 - 201) + (2010 - (201 - 20)). Simplifies to 20 - 1809 + (2010 - 181). Which reduces to 20 - 1809 + 1829 = 40. Hence, the answer is 40.
