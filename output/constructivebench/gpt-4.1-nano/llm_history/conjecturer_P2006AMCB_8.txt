  a + b = P2006AMCB_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The given relations are \(1 = \frac{1}{4}(2 + a)\) and \(2 = \frac{1}{4}(1 + b)\). Solving these:
\(a = 4 \times 1 - 2 = 2\),
\(b = 4 \times 2 - 1 = 7\).
Sum: \(a + b = 2 + 7 = 9\). Generalizing, the sum is always 9.

<<<9>>>
