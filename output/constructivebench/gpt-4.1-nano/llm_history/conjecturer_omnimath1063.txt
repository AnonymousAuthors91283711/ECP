Given the polynomial (2x+1)(3x+1)(5x+1)(30x+1)=10, the roots are rational and the pattern suggests symmetry with initial roots near zero. The general solutions are the roots of the polynomial, which simplifies to x being one of the roots of the equation, i.e., solving for x yields roots at specific rational values. The roots can be expressed explicitly by solving the polynomial for x, but since the roots are roots of a quartic, an explicit algebraic expression appears complicated. The roots, in a closed form, are the solutions to the polynomial, which are algebraic but can be eliminated as a set through the roots of the polynomial.

Based on the pattern in enumerated answers, the solution set consists of the roots of the polynomial, which we identify explicitly as the four roots obtained from solving the quartic. The roots are:

x = (-1/2) * p, where p takes values 1, 3, 5, and 30, depending on the quadratic factorization.

In explicit form, setting the roots explicitly yields

- x = (−1/2), when (2x+1)=0;
- x = (−1/3), when (3x+1)=0;
- x = (−1/5), when (5x+1)=0;
- from (30x+1)=0, x=−1/30.

Thus, the explicit set of solutions can be expressed as:

The set of solutions is {−1/2, −1/3, −1/5, −1/30}.

<<<{r : ℝ | r = -1/2 ∨ r = -1/3 ∨ r = -1/5 ∨ r = -1/30}>>>
