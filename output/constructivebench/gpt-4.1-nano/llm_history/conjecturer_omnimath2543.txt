The expression K involves pairwise sums of roots of P, which are 7th roots of 7. Simplifying, the sum over roots' pairwise sums is a constant related to symmetric functions of roots. Using roots \(r_i = \zeta^i \sqrt[7]{7}\), where \(\zeta = e^{2\pi i / 7}\), we derive that \(K^2 = 49 \times 7^{6}\).

Therefore, the closed form is \(7^{7}\).
