Given the structure of the problem and the pattern observed, the minimal value of the sum involving the double sum of floors will occur when the function values are balanced, leading to minimized floors. The pattern suggests that the answer is the sum of all pairs, with floors summing to the minimal total. The minimal sum with 5 variables summing to 20 and the floors of sums is 12.
