Given the matrix M, entries are decomposed into row and column sums plus 2 times col sum, suggesting pattern detection. Calculating the total sum and equating bounds points toward the total sum structure. 

Summation over matrix entries yields sum of all elements (7+1+5+9+3+7+8+2+6=48). The sum is partitioned into row  sums and col sums related via the formula M i j = row_ops i + 2 * col_ops j. 

The total sum: (a + 2b + ...). Simplified, the total sum equals sum of row contributions (a + a + a = 3a) plus twice the total of column contributions (2b). Solving for a + 2b: total matrix sum set to 48, gives the answer as sum of row and column sums 3a + 2b=48. Since the total sum is 48 and this is linearly decomposed, the minimal or symmetric values satisfy a + 2b = 16.

Answer:

<<<16>>>
