The set {x | arctan x = x^2 - 1.6} consists of solutions to the equation arctan x = x^2 - 1.6. Since arctan x is bounded between -π/2 and π/2, and x^2 - 1.6 is unbounded with respect to x, the solutions are finite and occur where these two graphs intersect. The approximate intersection points are around x ≈ ±1, accounting for the bounded arctan. From the pattern and enumeration, the total number of solutions is 2.
