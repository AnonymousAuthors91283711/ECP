(hx : 3 + x = 5)
(hy : -3 + y = 5)
: x + y = omnimath2913_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given hx : 3 + x = 5 ⇒ x = 2, and hy : -3 + y = 5 ⇒ y = 8, the sum x + y = 10. A pattern suggests the answer is a fixed constant based on these constraints. Final answer: <<<10>>>
