Ground Truth Answer: 26
Proposed Answer: 16
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have three equations:
   - (a + b + c)/3 = 16 → a + b + c = 48
   - (c + d + e)/3 = 26 → c + d + e = 78
   - (a + b + c + d + e)/5 = 20 → a + b + c + d + e = 100

2. From the first two equations:
   (a + b + c) + (c + d + e) = 48 + 78 = 126
   But from the third equation, we know a + b + c + d + e = 100
   Therefore, c = 126 - 100 = 26

The ground truth answer is correct (c = 26), while the proposed answer (16) is incorrect. The proposed answer seems to be just copying the first average value without proper calculation.

<<<False>>>
