The pattern suggests solutions where \(x\) relate to specific powers or linear forms, and \(y, z\) scale accordingly to satisfy the equation. Given the structure, the solutions are likely when \(x=0\) or \(x \equiv 2 \pmod 7\), with corresponding \(y,z\). Based on enumeration, the set is characterized by this pattern.
