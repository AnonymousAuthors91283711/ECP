theorem omnimath104 (a : ℕ) (ha : 0 < a) :
  (∀ (x y : ℕ), x > y → y ≥ 0 → Nat.xor x (a * x) ≠ Nat.xor y (a * y)) ↔ a ∈ omnimath104_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern indicates that the answer involves powers of two, related to binary XOR properties; specifically, the XOR function's behavior suggests the critical role of divisibility by 2. Thus, the set likely includes all odd numbers (elements not divisible by 2). 

Therefore, the formula representing such an a is the set of all odd natural numbers:

<<<{a : ℕ | a % 2 = 1}>>>
