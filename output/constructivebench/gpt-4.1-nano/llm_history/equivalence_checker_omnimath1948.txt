Ground Truth Answer: 199
Proposed Answer: 101
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

The problem is asking for the largest number S such that every amount from 1 to S can be formed using a set of distinct positive coin denominations that must include 100, and no amounts beyond S can be formed with this set.

Key observations:
1. The coin set must include 100
2. All coins must be distinct positive integers
3. Every amount from 1 to S must be formable
4. S should be maximal for such a set

The ground truth answer is 199, which makes sense because:
- The optimal coin set would be {1, 100}
- With these, we can form:
  - 1-99 using just 1s
  - 100 using the 100 coin
  - 101-199 using 100 + combinations of 1s
- 199 is the maximum possible (100 + 99*1)
- 200 would require two 100s, which we don't have

The proposed answer is 101, which is incorrect because:
- With the same {1, 100} set, we can actually form up to 199
- 101 is too low - we can clearly form much higher amounts
- The answer seems to only consider up to 100 + 1 = 101, missing that we can add multiple 1s
