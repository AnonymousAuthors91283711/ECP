Given that \(P m n := m^2 * n = 20^{20}\), and both \(m, n > 0\), the solutions are divisors \(m\) of \(20^{20}\) with corresponding \(n = 20^{20} / m^2\). The positive divisors \(m\) correspond to \(m = 20^{10} \cdots 20^k\). To fill the divisors, \(m^2 | 20^{20}\) implies \(m | 20^{10}\) with \(m = 20^k\), where \(k\) ranges from 0 to 10.

The total solutions are then the number of integers \(k\) from 0 to 10, inclusive, i.e., \(11\).

Final answer: \(11\).
