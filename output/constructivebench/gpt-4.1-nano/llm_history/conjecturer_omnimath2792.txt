theorem omnimath2792 :
  2 ^ 3 + 2 ^ 2 + 2 ^ 1 = omnimath2792_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The enumerated answers suggest summing powers of 2: \(2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1\). Calculating gives 8 + 4 + 2 = 14. No pattern implying a more complex expression; thus, the general form matches the sum directly. 

<<<3 * 2 ^ 2 + 2^1>>>
