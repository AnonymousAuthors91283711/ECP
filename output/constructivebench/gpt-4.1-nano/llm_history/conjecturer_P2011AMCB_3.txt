  ∃! x : ℝ, A + x = B - x ∧ x = P2011AMCB_3_answer A B := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
The equation A + x = B - x simplifies to 2x = B - A, leading to x = (B - A) / 2. The pattern in enumerations suggests the answer might involve the midpoint formula.  
Final expression: <<<fun A B : ℝ => (B - A) / 2>>>
