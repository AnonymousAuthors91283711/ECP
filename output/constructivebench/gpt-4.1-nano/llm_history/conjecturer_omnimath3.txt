The pattern suggests the solutions involve specific configurations of a_i to ensure the polynomial's roots and coefficients meet the condition. The symmetric nature of the constraints hints at a statement involving the non-vanishing and symmetry of the a_i, possibly with a set of all positive real numbers satisfying certain symmetries. Since the existential quantifiers relate to swapping coefficients a_i and a_j leading to roots of zero, the final statement likely expresses that such an arrangement always exists for positive coefficients.
