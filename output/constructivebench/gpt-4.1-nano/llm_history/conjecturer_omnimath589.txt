The problem involves a functional condition with a multiplicative property, resembling the structure of functions satisfying \( f(a)f(b) = f(a^2b^2) \). From the pattern in enumerated examples, the solutions tend to be constantly equal to 1, especially when functions are restricted by lower bounds and the functional equation. The absence of such functions suggests the answer involves the nonexistence or a trivial statement.

Considering the equivalence and the nature of the problem, the final proposition likely asserts that no such function exists, i.e., the universal statement about nonexistence.
