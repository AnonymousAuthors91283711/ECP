Given the pattern of the sum and the algebraic expressions, the set of pairs (x, y) satisfying the quadratic equation involves specific factorizations or perfect squares related to the variables. Based on typical structure, the final set includes pairs where (x, y) satisfy certain divisibility conditions that turn the product into a perfect square. 

This pattern suggests that the pairs are characterized by the solutions where (x * y + 1) * (x * y + x + 2) is a perfect square, which occurs when the factors form a Pythagorean triple pattern or factor into a perfect square via specific algebraic relationships.

The proposed answer appears to try to equate (x * y + 1) * (x * y + x + 2) with a perfect square constructed from the sum of the variables, specifically (x * y + 1 + x + y + 1)^2. Checking the expression:

x * y + x + y + 2 = (x + 1)(y + 1).

Thus, the product becomes:

(x * y + 1) * (x + 1)(y + 1).

Observe that (x * y + 1) and (x + 1)(y + 1) are factors, but typically, the perfect square condition would involve a direct square of a sum or product involving these expressions. To form a perfect square, it makes sense to consider the sum inside the square as (x + 1)(y + 1). And notice that:

(x * y + 1) * (x + 1)(y + 1) = (x * y + 1) * (x + 1)(y + 1)

which could be perfect square when both factors are perfect squares or their product is a perfect square.

Given the pattern from the enumerated answer, a plausible closed form for the set is:

{ (x, y) | (x * y + 1) * (x + 1)(y + 1) = (x + y + 2)^2 }

since (x + y + 2) encapsulates the sum factors and matches the observed pattern.

Therefore, the corrected Lean expression is:

The main goal is to define a set of pairs `(x, y)` such that `(x * y + 1) * (x + 1)(y + 1)` is a perfect square, and to express this as a closed-form set in Lean. The pattern from the enumeration hints that the perfect square condition involves the expression `(x + y + 2)^2`, as it naturally combines the variables and turns the problem into a more manageable algebraic condition.

Based on the analysis, the key is to express the set precisely in Lean syntax as a set comprehension: all pairs `(x, y)` satisfying `(x * y + 1) * (x + 1) * (y + 1) = (x + y + 2)^2`. This captures the condition that the product is a perfect square, specifically a perfect square of `(x + y + 2)`.

The error in the initial attempt was an incorrect syntax and extraneous explanatory text within the abbreviation. The corrected, syntactically valid Lean code snippet should be:

```lean
<<< { (x, y) : ℕ × ℕ | (x * y + 1) * (x + 1) * (y + 1) = (x + y + 2)^2 } >>.
```

This defines `omnimath251_answer` as the set of all pairs `(x, y)` satisfying the algebraic perfect square condition derived from pattern analysis.

**Final answer:**

<<< { (x, y) : ℕ × ℕ | (x * y + 1) * (x + 1) * (y + 1) = (x + y + 2)^2 } >>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error arises because in Lean, the syntax for defining a set via set comprehension uses braces `{}` directly, and does not incorporate the `<<<` delimiters within the definition. The `<<<` delimiters are used in the user's answer to delineate the entire answer expression outside of the proof context. 

Furthermore, the current proposed answer appears to be close but possibly inconsistent with the pattern in the enumerated answers or the problem's structure. The enumerated solutions suggest a quadratic relationship involving `x`, `y`, and their sums, likely derived from the original equation `(x * y + 1) * (x * y + x + 2) = k^2`.

Matching the structure and pattern observed, the correct set should encompass all pairs `(x, y)` satisfying the relation:

\[
(x y + 1)(x + y + 2) = \text{a perfect square}
\]

which aligns with the given problem statement.

Therefore, the correct syntax should be without `<<<` inside the definition, and modeled as an explicit set with a comprehension. The corrected answer, given the structure and pattern, would be:

```lean
{ (x, y) : ℕ × ℕ | (x * y + 1) * (x + y + 2) = (x + y + 2)^2 }
```

This set captures the pairs `(x, y)` where the expression `(x * y + 1) * (x + y + 2)` forms a perfect square, matching the problem's relation.

Thus, the final answer is:

<<< { (x, y) : ℕ × ℕ | (x * y + 1) * (x + y + 2) = (x + y + 2)^2 } >>>
