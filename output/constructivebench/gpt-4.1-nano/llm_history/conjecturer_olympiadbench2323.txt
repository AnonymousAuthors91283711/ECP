abbrev olympiadbench2323_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2323 :
  {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (n ^ 2 + n + 15) % n = 0} = olympiadbench2323_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The condition (n^2 + n + 15) % n = 0 implies n divides 15, so n ∈ {1, 3, 5, 15}.  
Answer: set of all n such that n divides 15.  
Lean expression: <<< { n | n ∣ 15 } >>>
