  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∃ (P : ℤ[X]), P.eval (-10) = 145 ∧ P.eval 9 = 164 ∧ |P.eval 0| = n} omnimath1459_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The minimum absolute value |P(0)| when P satisfies P(-10)=145 and P(9)=164 suggests constructing a polynomial fitting these points and minimizing |P(0)|. A key relation is P(0)= (a written form depending on the difference of evaluations at given points. By linear interpolation, the polynomial difference factors influence the minimal value. The pattern indicates the minimal n is achieved via the smallest linear combination satisfying the constraints, namely their difference scaled to the point 0. 

Thus, the minimal value is the absolute difference divided by the difference in evaluations at given points, times the value at 0, which simplifies to 29, given the divisor and combining the constraints. 

The explicit formula yields:

λ = (164 - 145) / (9 - (-10)) = 19 / 19 = 1.

Hence, the minimal |P(0)|= |145 + λ*(0 + 10)| = |145 + 10|= 155 but scaled down by the scaling factor, the minimal result is 29.

Answer:

<<<29>>>
