The pattern suggests the function must be additive and respect prime divisibility, hinting at multiplicative form projection. The pattern indicates the function is proportional to the input, likely scaled by \( 2^{n-1} \). Given no additional constraints, the simplest form that fits the conditions is \( f(n) = n \times 2^{n-1} \).
