    (x y : ℝ)
    (hconst : 2 + x = x + y ∧ x + y = y + 5) :
    x - y = omnimath3032_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the enumerated answer pattern and the system of equations, the solution simplifies to the constant value 3, regardless of x and y, since the equations imply y + 5 = 2 + x and x + y = y + 5. Thus, the answer is 3.
