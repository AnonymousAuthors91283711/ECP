The patterns suggest the sequence satisfies recurrence a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_{n}, resembling Fibonacci-type sequences. The relations imply a_{0} and a_{3} are linked via combinations of initial terms; using finite difference solutions and the cosine-based quadratic fit, the constants cancel out to produce a fixed difference. The maximum value of cos(a0) - cos(a3) occurs when cos(a0) = 1 and cos(a3) = -1, maximizing the difference to 2.
