The pattern suggests the minimal n where the number of divisors of 214·n equals that of 2014·n. Factoring reveals 214 = 2 × 107, 2014 = 2 × 19 × 53. To balance divisor counts, n should include the prime 107 and not 19 or 53 to keep the divisor counts equal. The smallest positive n satisfying this is n = 107.
