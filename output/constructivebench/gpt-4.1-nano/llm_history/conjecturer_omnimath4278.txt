Given the conditions, the intersection over all sets is nonempty and divides the cardinality of any nonempty intersection subset, indicating a pigeonhole principle. Since each intersection's size is divisible by subset cardinality, it suggests the existence of an element common to at least half of the sets. Hence, the minimal such n is 50.
