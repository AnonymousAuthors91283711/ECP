Ground Truth Answer: -63
Proposed Answer: 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for three distinct integers (a, b, c) that satisfy several conditions, including:
   - They form an arithmetic sequence (b - a = c - b)
   - Their product is 17955
   - There's an integer ratio r relating certain linear combinations
   - The sum a + b + c equals the answer

2. The ground truth answer is -63, which suggests the numbers are negative and their sum is negative.

3. The proposed answer is 0, which would require either:
   - Three numbers that sum to zero (e.g., -k, 0, k)
   - Or numbers whose positive and negative values cancel out

4. Checking the product condition:
   - For sum 0 case (like -k, 0, k), the product would be 0, but 17955 ≠ 0
   - For other cases where sum is 0, it's unlikely to satisfy all other conditions

5. The ground truth answer -63 comes from the actual solution (-21, -15, -9) which satisfies all conditions:
   - Distinct: yes
   - Arithmetic sequence: -15 - (-21) = -9 - (-15) = 6
   - Product: (-21)*(-15)*(-9) = -2835 ≠ 17955 (Wait, this contradicts the problem statement)
   - Actually, the correct solution should be (21, -15, -51) which gives sum -45 (not -63), but product is indeed 17955

This suggests there might be some confusion in either the ground truth or proposed answer, but clearly 0 cannot be correct as it would require the product to be 0.
