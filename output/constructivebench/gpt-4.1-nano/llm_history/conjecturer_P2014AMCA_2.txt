Given the relationships h_child and h_initial, substituting h_child into h_initial yields a linear equation in adult_price, which after solving gives my answer as a simplification of the total cost expression, resulting in a closed form.

The proposed answer `(49 / 4)` is a rational number literal, which Lean cannot evaluate directly in `ℝ` without explicit noncomputable annotation because `Real` does not support division by default in a computable way, especially for literals like `49 / 4`. To fix the error, I will declare the answer as a `noncomputable` constant. This is a common approach when dealing with real literals involving division in Lean. Additionally, converting the literal explicitly into a `ℝ` using `↑` (the coercion from `ℚ` to `ℝ`) ensures proper typing.

Based on the constraints:
- The problem involves linear equations with the prices
- `child_price = adult_price / 2`
- `5 * adult_price + 4 * child_price = 24.50`
- The quantity `8 * adult_price + 6 * child_price` correlates to the answer

Calculating directly:
From the second equation, substitute `child_price`:
`5 * adult_price + 4 * (adult_price / 2) = 24.50`
→ `5 * adult_price + 2 * adult_price = 24.50`
→ `7 * adult_price = 24.50`
→ `adult_price = 24.50 / 7 = 3.5`

Then `child_price = adult_price / 2 = 1.75`.  
Finally:
`8 * adult_price + 6 * child_price = 8 * 3.5 + 6 * 1.75 = 28 + 10.5 = 38.5`

Expressed as a rational: `38.5 = 77 / 2`

However, the sample answer `(49 / 4)` equals `12.25`, which isn't matching this calculation.  
But the problem asks for the general form, so the formula derived from the equations is:
`(8 * adult_price + 6 * child_price) = (2 * 7 * adult_price + 6 * child_price)`, leading to the explicit value.

Given the calculation, the final answer should be `77 / 2`. 

Thus, the correct approach in Lean is to write the answer as `↑(77 / 2)` and ensure it's marked `noncomputable`.

The key here is that the question provides a system of two linear equations:

1) \(5 \cdot \text{adult\_price} + 4 \cdot \text{child\_price} = 24.50\)

2) \(\text{child\_price} = \frac{\text{adult\_price}}{2}\)

from which we need to find \(8 \cdot \text{adult\_price} + 6 \cdot \text{child\_price}\).

Substituting \( \text{child\_price} = \frac{\text{adult\_price}}{2} \) into the first gives:

\[
5 \cdot \text{adult\_price} + 4 \cdot \frac{\text{adult\_price}}{2} = 24.50
\Rightarrow 5 \cdot a + 2 \cdot a = 24.50
\Rightarrow 7a = 24.50
\Rightarrow a = \frac{24.50}{7} = 3.5
\]

then, the child price:

\[
c = \frac{a}{2} = \frac{3.5}{2} = 1.75
\]

Finally, the expression:

\[
8a + 6c = 8 \times 3.5 + 6 \times 1.75 = 28 + 10.5 = 38.5
\]

This suggests that the final answer should be 38.5 in ℝ.

In Lean, we need to define the answer as a concrete real number, ensure no naming conflicts, and correct syntax. Since `P2014AMCA_2` is the variable capturing the answer, and `P2014AMCA_2_answer` is the abbreviation in the statement, we avoid duplicate declaration.

<<<38.5>>>

**Explanation**:

- The calculation is straightforward substitution and simplification based on the two equations.
- The value \(a = 3.5\) and \(c = 1.75\) are directly obtained.
- The expression \(8a + 6c\) evaluates to 38.5.
- The errors in the original code stemmed from incorrect syntax (use of `noncomputable def` inside an abbreviation) and naming conflicts.
- The final answer in Lean is simply the real number 38.5, which agrees with the expected real type.
