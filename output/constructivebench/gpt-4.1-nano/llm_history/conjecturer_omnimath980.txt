The pattern suggests a limited structured set of relations. Given symmetry, identity on diagonals, and the implication constraints, the relation resembles a symmetric matrix with restricted entries, likely reducing to a specific size. Based on enumeration patterns, the count of such relations is 16, since each selection obeys the constraints, leading to 2^4 configurations.
