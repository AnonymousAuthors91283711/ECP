Given the pattern and the conditions on divisors and their sum, and considering the number 2022 with divisors d₁, d₂, d₃ > 0, distinct, dividing n, and summing to 2022, the minimal n satisfying these constraints will be their least common multiple scaled appropriately. Since the minimal such n occurs when d₁, d₂, d₃ are the divisors themselves (not multiple of larger divisors), the answer is the least common multiple of the three divisors, which sum to 2022. Assuming minimal choices d₁=1, d₂=2, d₃=2019, which sum to 2022, the minimal n will be their least common multiple: lcm(1, 2, 2019) = 2 * 2019 = 4038, because 2 divides 2 and 2019 is odd, the lcm is their product. 

Hence, the answer is:

<<<2 * 2019>>>
