Ground Truth Answer: 6 / 5
Proposed Answer: 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us three non-zero real numbers a, b, c that sum to zero, with the condition that the sum of their cubes equals the sum of their fifth powers. We need to find the value of a² + b² + c².

2. Key observations:
   - Since a + b + c = 0, we know a² + b² + c² = 2(ab + bc + ca)
   - The sum of cubes condition simplifies to -3abc = a⁵ + b⁵ + c⁵ (since a³ + b³ + c³ = 3abc when a+b+c=0)
   - Using symmetric polynomial identities, we can derive that a² + b² + c² = 6/5

3. The ground truth answer is 6/5 (1.2), while the proposed answer is 3.

4. The proposed answer is incorrect - it's exactly 2.5 times larger than the correct answer.
