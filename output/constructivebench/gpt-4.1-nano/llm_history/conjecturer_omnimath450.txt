Let's analyze the problem: The set contains 10 vertices, and edges form a complete subgraph (clique). The question asks for the maximum number \(k\) of vertices in \(V\) that are connected to all other vertices in \(V\). Since the entire graph over \(V}\) is complete, every vertex is connected to every other, ensuring each vertex has degree 9 within \(V\). We want the largest number \(k\) of vertices having this property.

Hence, the maximum is achieved when all vertices are connected to all others—i.e., the entire \(V\). All vertices have degree 9, so the number of vertices connected to all others equals 10.

Answer: <<<10>>>
