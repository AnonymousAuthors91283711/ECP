Given the structure of the problem, the conditions involve expressing \( r \) in terms of \( x_1, x_2 \) with quadratic relations, and the sum and product conditions suggest roots of quadratic equations. The key relationship likely concerns the sums and products of two negative roots relating to the quadratic's coefficients, which are linear in \( r \). The value of the sum of squares of the bounds \( p \) and \( q \) is then tied to the fixed constants in the problem. From the enumerated answers, the center value appears to be 7, with bounds \( r \) in an interval around that value, linked to the quadratic roots involving 87 and 7.

Conjecturally, the answer should be the sum of squares of these bounds, which matches the sum of squares of 7 and \(\sqrt{88}\).

So, the concise closed-form expression is:

<<<7^2 + (88)>>>
