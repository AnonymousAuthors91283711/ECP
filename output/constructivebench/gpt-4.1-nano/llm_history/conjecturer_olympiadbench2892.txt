The pattern indicates n must be between 2009 and 3009, and the sum of odd divisors equals 1024, a power of 2, likely involving perfect power structures of divisors.

Since summing all odd divisors equals 1024, and divisors are odd, focusing on n with divisors that sum to power of 2 suggests n being a power of 2 plus 1 or a structure where the divisors' sum forms a similar pattern. 

Given the constraints and the limited sum 1024, the likely candidate is n = 1025 (which is 2^10 + 1), as it falls into the range 2009-3009, or similarly, considering the pattern, n = 2049 (which is 2^11 + 1). But to fit in '2009 < n < 3009' and with divisors summing to 1024, the most consistent choice is n = 2049, as 2049 falls just over 2009, and the sum of its odd divisors appears to be 1024, matching power-of-two sum and the established pattern.

Thus, the answer is 2049.

<<<2049>>>
