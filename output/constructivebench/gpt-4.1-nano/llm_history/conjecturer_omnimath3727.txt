Let's analyze the constraints:

- s has 10 elements, all positive
- s.injective on id: unique elements
- sums and prods are based on pairwise sums and products
- sums.card ≤ 45 - 5 + 1 = 41; similarly for products, with bound involving k

The maximum sums occur with consecutive elements, like 1,2,3,...,10, giving the largest possible sum set. 

Likewise, the products maximize when elements are small and close, e.g., 1×2, 2×3, ..., but with an upper bound on the product set size reflecting k.

Given the constraints and pattern of enumeration, the extremum occurs at equilibrium where sums and products are minimized within the given bounds, which is achieved when the elements are consecutive positive integers starting from 1, i.e., {1,2,...,10}.

Thus, the maximum k satisfying the inequalities is 5, based on the relation m = 5 and the combinatorial limits.

In sum, the greatest such k consistent with the constraints is 5.

The corresponding answer in Lean is:

<<<5>>>

This matches the observed pattern and bounds.
