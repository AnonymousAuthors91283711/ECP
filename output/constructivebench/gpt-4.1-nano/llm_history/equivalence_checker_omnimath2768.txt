Ground Truth Answer: fun (x, y) => (3 * x + 2 * y) - (3 * x - 2 * y)
Proposed Answer: fun _ : ℤ × ℤ => -4
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem is asking to find a function that represents the expression (3*x + 2*y) - (3*x - 2*y) for integers x and y.

2. Let's simplify the expression:
   (3*x + 2*y) - (3*x - 2*y) = 3*x + 2*y - 3*x + 2*y = (3*x - 3*x) + (2*y + 2*y) = 0 + 4*y = 4*y

3. The ground truth answer correctly represents this simplified form as a function of (x,y).

4. The proposed answer is a constant function that always returns -4, regardless of input.

5. The proposed answer would only be correct if 4*y always equals -4, which is not true for all integer inputs (it's only true when y = -1).

6. The problem does give specific values (x = -2, y = -1), but the theorem is stated generally for all integers x,y with those constraints, and the answer should reflect that.

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It ignores the y parameter completely
- It doesn't match the simplified form 4*y
- It only works for the specific case y = -1
