Given the pattern in the enumerated answers and the nature of square roots of quadratic expressions, the key is that the sum of square roots being rational implies both individual roots are rational or perfect squares. However, for integer n, these roots are rational only if n - 1 and n + 1 are perfect squares, which is impossible simultaneously for integers except in trivial cases. Thus, the only solution occurs if n leads to perfect squares, i.e., n - 1 = a² and n + 1 = b² with a, b ∈ ℤ, which contradicts the difference being 2. Therefore, the statement is false for all n and r.

Answer: <<<False>>>
