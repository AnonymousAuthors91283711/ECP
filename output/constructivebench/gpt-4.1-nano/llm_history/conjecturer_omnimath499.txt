: (sqrt (105 ^ 3 - 104 ^ 3) = omnimath499_answer) ∧ (0 < omnimath499_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The expression simplifies as follows: \(105^3 - 104^3 = (105 - 104)(105^2 + 105 \cdot 104 + 104^2) = 1 \times (11025 + 10920 + 10816) = 32761 \). The square root of 32761 is 181, which is a perfect square. Hence, the answer is 181. 

<<<181>>>
