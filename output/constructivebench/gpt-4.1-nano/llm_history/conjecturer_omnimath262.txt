Given the functional equations and positivity conditions, the pattern suggests that \(f(n)\) depends multiplicatively on factors related to \(n\). The particular recurrence involving sums of squares indicates that \(f\) likely relates to exponential functions; the conditions for \(f(a^2 + b^2)\) and \(f(a^2)\) imply a quadratic structure consistent with \(f(n) = n^k\). For all such functions, positive integers \(k\) preserve the identities. Thus, the set of solutions contains functions of the form \(f(n) = n^k\) with \(k \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}\).

The errors in the Lean code arise from incorrect syntax in defining the abbreviation: the use of natural language comments within a `:=` assignment leads to parsing errors. The set of solutions, based on the functional equations, appears to be functions of the form \(f(n) = n^k\) where \(k > 0\). This makes sense because the conditions \(f(a^2 + b^2) = f(a)f(b)\) and \(f(a^2) = (f(a))^2\) suggest multiplicative and quadratic relation properties. Given the positivity condition, exponents \(k \in ℕ_{>0}\) are natural candidates for solutions.

Thus, the corrected Lean expression should formally define the set as all functions that can be expressed as \(f(n) = n^k\) with \(k > 0\).

Final answer:

<<<{f : ℕ → ℕ | ∃ (k : ℕ), k > 0 ∧ ∀ n, f n = n ^ k}>>>
