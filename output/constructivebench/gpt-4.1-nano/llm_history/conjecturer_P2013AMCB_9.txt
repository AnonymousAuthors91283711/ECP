The pattern indicates extracting the maximum square divisor of 12!, summing its prime exponents. The dominant square divisor is the largest perfect square dividing 12!, which is based on the 2's exponent since 2^10 divides 12!. The sum of exponents for the largest square factor is 2 * 5 = 10, as 2^10 divides 12!. So, the maximum sum of exponents for a square dividing 12! is 10.

<<<10>>>
