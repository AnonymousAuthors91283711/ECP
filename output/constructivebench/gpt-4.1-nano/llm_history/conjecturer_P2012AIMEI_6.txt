  ∃ (m : ℕ) (n : ℕ), Nat.Coprime m n ∧ m < n ∧
  ∃ (z w : ℂ), z^13 = w ∧ w^11 = z ∧ 
  z.im = Real.sin (m * Real.pi / n) ∧ n = P2012AIMEI_6_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern indicates the answer relates to dividing the circle into 13 and 11 parts, likely linked to the minimal n such that certain roots of unity exist with the given properties. The smallest such n is 13, where the constructed roots satisfy the conditions. Thus:

<<<13>>>
