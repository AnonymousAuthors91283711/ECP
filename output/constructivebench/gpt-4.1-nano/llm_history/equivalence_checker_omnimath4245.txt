The proposed answer captures the general form of the solution but doesn't explicitly list all valid pairs like the ground truth does. The mathematical conditions are equivalent (the proposed answer correctly describes the relationship between a and b), but it's missing the concrete enumeration of solutions. The proposed answer would yield the same set when computed, but isn't presented in the same explicit form as the ground truth.
