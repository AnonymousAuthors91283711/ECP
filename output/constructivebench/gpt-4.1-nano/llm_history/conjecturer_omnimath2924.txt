∀ n, 100000 ≤ n → (10 ∣ n ∧ 11 ∣ n ∧ 12 ∣ n ∧ 13 ∣ n ∧ 14 ∣ n ∧ 15 ∣ n) → (n = 100000 + omnimath2924_answer * 10)) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The smallest n satisfying divisibility by 10 to 15 is their least common multiple, which is 360360. The minimal such n ≥ 100000 is 360360 itself, so the answer count is zero multiples to reach 360360 after 100000. Then, the answer is 260360, the difference.  

Hence, the final representative answer: <<<260360>>>
