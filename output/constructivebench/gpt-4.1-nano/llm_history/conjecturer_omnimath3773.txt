The pattern suggests that functions satisfying the condition are quadratic, likely involving squares of the input. Given the constraints, linear functions with quadratic adjustment fit the pattern, notably f(x) = x^2, since it satisfies the relation a + b + c = 0 implying the sum of squares relation. Therefore, the set contains functions of the form f(x) = x^2 and functions derived from affine transformations that preserve the condition. The simplest closed form encompasses functions of the form f(x) = x^2.
