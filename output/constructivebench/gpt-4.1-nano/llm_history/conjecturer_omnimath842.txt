theorem omnimath842 :
  IsGreatest {s : Fin 6 → ℕ | 
    StrictMono s ∧ 
    (∀ i : Fin 5, s (Fin.succ i) % s i = 0) ∧ 
    (Finset.univ.sum s = 79)}

The pattern suggests the sequence is strictly increasing, with each term dividing the next, summing to 79, and constrained within 6 elements. The sequence likely maximizes the last element under these constraints. An optimal increasing sequence with divisibility and sum 79 is (1,2,4,8,16,48). Sum check: 1+2+4+8+16+48 = 79. So the maximal last element is 48.
