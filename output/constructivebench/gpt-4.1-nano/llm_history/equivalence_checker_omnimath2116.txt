Ground Truth Answer: Real.sqrt 109
Proposed Answer: 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the infimum (greatest lower bound) of a set of real numbers defined by a specific expression involving square roots, with x ranging from -1 to 1.

2. The ground truth answer is √109 ≈ 10.4403

3. The proposed answer is 7, which is significantly smaller than √109.

4. To verify, let's test a specific value of x:
   - At x = 0:
     √(58-0) + √(149-0) = √58 + √149 ≈ 7.6158 + 12.2066 ≈ 19.8224
   - The minimum value is clearly less than this, but certainly greater than 7.

5. The proposed answer of 7 is too low to be the infimum of this set.
