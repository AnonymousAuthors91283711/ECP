The problem asks for the number of positive integers \(k\) satisfying specific linear Diophantine conditions. Analyzing the equations, the possible \(k\) values scale linearly with solutions for \(x, y\). The pattern in enumerated answers suggests a simple relation proportional to the total solutions. Based on the enumeration, the count appears to be \(13\) for the given constraints. Hence, the answer is a constant positive integer. 

<<<13>>>
