The pattern in the enumerated answers suggests the minimal cardinal satisfying the divisibility condition likely corresponds to a set of all elements divisible by a specific divisor. Given the divisibility condition involving a + b - 2c, the critical divisor appears to be 2025 itself, indicating the set possibly contains elements with particular modularity properties. Thus, the cardinal might be the count of such elements, which is the number of multiples of a divisor within 1 to 2025. Since 2025 divides itself, the set is possibly the singleton {2025}. 

Final answer: <<<1>>>
