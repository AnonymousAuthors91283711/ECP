    let a1 := 9
    let a2 := a1 + d
    let a3 := a2 + d

    g2^2 = g1 * g3 ∧ c = g3} 
  P2004AMCA_14_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the value c equals g3, which is defined as a3 + 20, with a3 = a2 + d, a2 = a1 + d, and a1 = 9. The condition g2² = g1 * g3 leads to specific d, and calculations yield c as 80.
