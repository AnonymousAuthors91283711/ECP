Ground Truth Answer: fun n => ⌊log 2 n⌋₊ + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n / 2 * (n + 1)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal sum of a_i/(i+1) where a is a bijection (permutation) of {0,...,n-1}.

2. The ground truth answer suggests the minimal sum is ⌊log₂ n⌋ + 1, which makes sense because:
   - The minimal sum would occur when we pair the largest a_i with smallest denominators
   - This logarithmic behavior matches intuition about optimal pairings

3. The proposed answer gives a quadratic formula n/2*(n+1), which:
   - Is the sum of first n natural numbers (n(n+1)/2)
   - This would be the sum if we had a_i = i (identity permutation) with denominators all 1
   - But denominators vary as (i+1), so this can't be correct
   - Also, quadratic growth contradicts the logarithmic ground truth

The proposed answer is completely different from and incompatible with the ground truth answer.
