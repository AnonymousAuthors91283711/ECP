Given the sum over natural numbers with prime factors only 2, 3, 5, the sum of reciprocals of such n is known to be a product of geometric series. The sum equals the product (1 + 1/2 + 1/2^2 + ...) * (1 + 1/3 + 1/3^2 + ...) * (1 + 1/5 + 1/5^2 + ...), which simplifies to (1 - 1/2)^(-1) * (1 - 1/3)^(-1) * (1 - 1/5)^(-1). Computing, this yields 6 * 3/2 * 5/4 = 15/4. 

Final answer:
<<<(15, 4)>>>
