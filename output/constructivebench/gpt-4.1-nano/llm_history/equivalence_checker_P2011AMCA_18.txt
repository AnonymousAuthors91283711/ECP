abbrev P2011AMCA_18_answer : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem P2011AMCA_18 (x y : ℝ) (h : |x + y| + |x - y| = 2) :
  IsGreatest {z : ℝ | ∃ x' y', |x' + y'| + |x' - y'| = 2 ∧ z = x'^2 - 6*x' + y'^2} (P2011AMCA_18_answer x y) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => x^2 - 6*x + y^2
Proposed Answer: fun x y => (x - 3)^2 + y^2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest value of the expression x² - 6x + y² under the constraint |x + y| + |x - y| = 2.

2. The ground truth answer directly gives the expression x² - 6x + y².

3. The proposed answer gives (x - 3)² + y², which expands to x² - 6x + 9 + y².

Comparing these:
- The proposed answer has an extra +9 term compared to the ground truth
- The expressions are not equivalent
- The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the original problem's requirements

<<<False>>>
