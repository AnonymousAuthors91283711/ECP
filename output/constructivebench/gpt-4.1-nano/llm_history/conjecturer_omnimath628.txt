Given the problem, the only numbers in the interval [10^6, 10^9] divisible by 7 and perfect squares are those that are perfect squares divisible by 7, i.e., squares of multiples of √7 (which is irrational), so the multiples of 7 squared.

Since we're within large bounds, the smallest multiple of 7 ≥ √(10^6) is 7 * 377 (since 377^2 ≈ 142,129 ≥ 10^6), and the largest multiple under √(10^9) is 7 * 31622 (since 31622^2 ≈ 10^9).

Number of such multiples: from 377 to 31622 inclusive.

Count: 31622 - 377 + 1 = 31246.

Final answer is this count.

Answer:
<<<(31622 - 377 + 1)>>>
