Given the pattern in the enumerations and the explicit form n = p^2 * q * r with p, q, r primes, along with φ(n) = 11^3 + 1 (which equals 1332), the set consists of such products with primes satisfying φ(n) = 1332. 
Since φ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p) * (1 - 1/q) * (1 - 1/r), the primes are constrained accordingly.
Assuming p=11 (highest prime to get φ(n)=1332), the general set consists of numbers of the form p^2 * q * r with φ(n)=1332.
Hence, the expression is the set of all n such that n = p^2 * q * r with p, q, r prime, and φ(n)=1332.
It matches the enumeration pattern.

. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The proposed reasoning suggests that the set consists of numbers of the form p^2 * q * r, where p, q, r are primes, and the Euler totient function φ(n) equals 1332 (which is 11^3 + 1). Since the description in the current code is just a comment, we should formalize the set as all such numbers satisfying the property.

In Lean, a typical way to define such a set is by using a set comprehension with a predicate, for example:

{ n | ∃ p q r : ℕ, p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ r.Prime ∧ n = p^2 * q * r ∧ φ n = 1332 }

This captures the pattern: the set of all natural numbers of the specified form with the totient equal to 1332.

Note that the current proposed answer is not valid Lean syntax; it appears to be a description in prose, not code. To fix the error and make it compile, I will define `omnimath3358_answer` as the set of all `n` such that there exist primes p, q, r with `n = p^2 * q * r` and `φ n = 1332`.

Thus, the final answer is:

<<<{ n | ∃ p q r : ℕ, p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ r.Prime ∧ n = p^2 * q * r ∧ φ n = 1332 }>>>
