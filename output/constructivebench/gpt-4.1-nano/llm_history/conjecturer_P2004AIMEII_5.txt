The pattern suggests examining total work divided into four parts, proportional to w. The critical inequality reduces to solving for x in relation to w, and the minimal integer satisfying it across possible w. Observing the enumerations, x appears to be maximized within the bounds, leading to the minimal x satisfying the inequality for all w.

Therefore, the explicit closed form is derived by substituting w with 4 (the minimal division). The remaining work becomes 1000*4 - (1000 + 900 + 800), so that simplifies to 4000 - 2700 = 1300. The inequality then is:

(800 + x) * 1 ≥ 1300 → 800 + x ≥ 1300 → x ≥ 500.

Hence, the minimal such x over all w is 500.

. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The error occurs because the syntax `<<<500>>>` is invalid in Lean for defining a value. The `<<<` and `>>>` delimiters are not valid syntax; they are just to mark the answer in this context. The answer should directly assign the value `500` to `P2004AIMEII_5_answer` using the `:=` operator with no delimiters.

Also, considering the nature of the problem, the candidate answer `500` likely corresponds to some critical or optimized value satisfying the inequalities, possibly the minimal or feasible work-equivalent x value.

Therefore, the correct fixed definition should be:

```lean
abbrev P2004AIMEII_5_answer : ℕ := 500
```

It directly assigns the answer `500` without invalid delimiters and compiles properly.

---

**Summary:** Removed the `<<<` and `>>>` delimiters to fix the syntax error, and set the value `500` as the final answer.
