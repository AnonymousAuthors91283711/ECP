The pattern suggests the answer depends on a simple symmetric relation of roots via the parabola’s geometry; with the gap x3 - x2=150 and roots x1, x2, x3, x4, the key value relates directly to the segment length divided by 2, reflecting the parabola symmetry and root placement.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The main issue with the initial answer "x4 - x1) / 2" is that `x4` and `x1` are variables bound within the theorem’s context, but you are trying to define `P2009AMCA_23_answer` as an independent ab abbreviation, which does not have access to local variables. To fix this, `P2009AMCA_23_answer` should be a function that takes the relevant variables as input, or you should define it as a constant in a context where those variables are available.

Since the theorem states the existence of particular `x1, x2, x3, x4` with properties, and the answer involves these variables, the most logical way is to define `P2009AMCA_23_answer` as a function of these variables rather than a fixed constant. But for the purpose of returning the conjectured closed-form, it appears `P2009AMCA_23_answer` should be expressed as a function of these variables or as a formula involving them.

Given the pattern of the enumerated answer, the key is probably that the answer directly relates to the difference `x4 - x1`, which seems to be critical in the problem, possibly linked to the structure of quadratic functions.

Based on the above and the fact that the answer depends on `x4 - x1`, I propose defining `P2009AMCA_23_answer` as:

```lean
<<<fun x1 x4 => (x4 - x1) / 2.0>>> 
```

which gives a closed-form expression: half of the difference between the extrema points on the functions, aligning with the hypothesis that, under the quadratic and symmetry conditions, the key quantity is `(x4 - x1) / 2`. Also, marking it as noncomputable might be necessary if it involves real division that isn’t algorithmically computed directly.

Final proposed code:

The main issue is that the abbreviation `P2009AMCA_23_answer` is declared as an `ℝ` (Real) but the proposed answer uses a lambda (function) syntax (`fun x1 x4 => ...`), which is invalid in this context. We should define a constant of type `ℝ`, which could be the value of the expression `(x4 - x1) / 2`.

Given the problem involves the roots `x1` and `x4` of certain quadratic functions and their differences, an elementary guess consistent with quadratic roots relations is that the solution expresses some average or midpoint of certain roots, such as `(x4 + x1) / 2`.

However, since the enumerated answer is `(x4 - x1) / 2.0`, which suggests half the difference of the roots, I will use that as the definitive form. Also, I will omit lambda notation and ensure the answer is a proper real number.
