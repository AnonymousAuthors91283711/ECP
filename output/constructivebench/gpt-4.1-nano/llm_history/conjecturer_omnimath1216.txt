The condition IsSquare (lcm n 9) implies that lcm n 9 is a perfect square. Since 9 = 3^2, the gcd divides n, and lcm(n, 9) = (n * 9) / gcd(n, 9). To be a perfect square, n must contain the factor 3^{2k} to synchronize with 3^2, and n must be divisible by 3^{2k} with k ≥ 1. For 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, the perfect squares with gcd conditions are multiples of 3^{2k} where 3^{2k} ≤ 1000. The powers are 3^2=9, 3^4=81, 3^6=729. These exponents suggest n = 3^{2k} times square numbers. The count of such n is obtained by summing over these factors, totaling 49 numbers.

Final answer:
<<<49>>>
