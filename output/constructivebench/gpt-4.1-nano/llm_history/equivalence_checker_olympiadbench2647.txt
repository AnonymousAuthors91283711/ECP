Ground Truth Answer: (-266, -3, -28)
Proposed Answer: ( -7, 2, -7 )
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all integer solutions (x,y,z) that satisfy both equations:
   - x*y - z² = y²*z - x
   - y²*z - x = 14

2. The ground truth answer is (-266, -3, -28)

3. The proposed answer is (-7, 2, -7)

Let's test the proposed answer:
First equation: (-7)*2 - (-7)² = -14 - 49 = -63
Second part: 2²*(-7) - (-7) = -28 + 7 = -21
These are not equal (-63 ≠ -21), so it doesn't satisfy the first equation.

The ground truth answer:
First equation: (-266)*(-3) - (-28)² = 798 - 784 = 14
Second part: (-3)²*(-28) - (-266) = -252 + 266 = 14
This satisfies both equations.

<<<False>>>
