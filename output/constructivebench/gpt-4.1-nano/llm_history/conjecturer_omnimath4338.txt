The problem's pattern indicates exploring signs ε_i ± 1 in summations. The sum constraint (≤ 1) suggests the maximum sum is achieved when the signs are chosen optimally, specifically when ε_i align with the signs of a_i or b_i. The key is the dimension n, with critical threshold at n = 2, where the sum's magnitude can reach 2 (if all signs are +1 or -1). For n ≥ 3, the sum can be controlled to be ≤ 1 due to the combinatorial nature of sign choices.
