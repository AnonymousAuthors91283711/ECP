Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer:  4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest number of students (n) where:
   - Each student scores at least 60
   - There are exactly 5 students who scored 100
   - The average score is exactly 76 (since total = 76*n)

2. Ground truth answer is 13, which is correct because:
   - Minimum case occurs when we have 5 students with 100 and the rest with minimum score 60
   - Let x be number of 60-scorers: (5*100 + x*60)/(5+x) = 76
   - Solving: 500 + 60x = 76x + 380 → 120 = 16x → x = 7.5
   - Since x must be integer, next possible is x=8 → n=13
   - Check: (500 + 480)/13 ≈ 75.38 (too low)
   - Need to adjust some 60s to higher scores to reach exact 76 average

3. Proposed answer is 4, which is impossible because:
   - We need at least 5 students (to have 5 with score 100)
   - Even if we ignore that, with n=4:
     - Maximum possible total is 4*100=400
     - Required total is 76*4=304
     - But we must have 5 students scoring 100, which is impossible with only 4 students
