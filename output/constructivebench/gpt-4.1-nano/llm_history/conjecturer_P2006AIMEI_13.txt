theorem P2006AIMEI_13 :
  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | n < 1000 ∧ ∃ m : ℕ, (∑ k in Finset.range (2^(n-1)), padicValNat 2 (2*k)) = m^2} P2006AIMEI_13_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sum of padicValNat 2 over even multiples within 2^(n-1) produces a perfect square. Pattern suggests the answer is related to 2^{n-1}. The maximum n < 1000 satisfying the property is at n=999. Thus, answer is 2^{n-1}.

<<<2^(999 - 1)>>>
