Considering the pattern and the enumerated answers, the key is the set of k with m^2 = k dividing 10^10 (which equals 2^10 * 5^10). The divisors of 10^10 are of the form 2^a * 5^b with 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 10, and squares require even exponents. The total count of such divisors is (10/2 + 1) * (10/2 + 1) = 6 * 6 = 36. Therefore, the cardinality of such k is 36.
