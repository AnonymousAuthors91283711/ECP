theorem P2007AMCA_3 :
  (∃ a b : ℤ,
    Odd a ∧ Odd b ∧ a < b ∧ b = 3 * a ∧ a + b = P2007AMCA_3_answer) ∧
  (∀ a b : ℤ,
    Odd a ∧ Odd b ∧ a < b ∧ b = 3 * a → a + b = P2007AMCA_3_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern, the sum has the form of two odd integers where one is triple the other, and the total sum holds specific symmetry. For minimality and symmetry, the sum should be twice an odd integer (since b=3a and both are odd, sum is even).  
Hence, the sum simplifies to 4a + 3a = 7a, with a odd, so total sum is divisible by 7, and the minimal sum for the smallest odd a (a=1), yields \(\boxed{7}\).  
Final answer: <<<7>>>
