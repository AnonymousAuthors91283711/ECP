Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n - 1)^2 / 2
Proposed Answer: fun n => 2 * n - 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of 3-element arithmetic progressions that can be formed from a strictly increasing sequence of n real numbers.

2. The ground truth answer suggests that the maximum number is (n-1)²/2. This makes sense because:
   - For each pair of elements (potential first and third term of an AP), there's at most one middle element that would form an AP
   - There are C(n,2) ≈ n²/2 possible pairs
   - But due to the strictly increasing constraint, the exact count is (n-1)²/2

3. The proposed answer is 2n-2, which grows linearly with n, while the ground truth grows quadratically.

4. For small values of n:
   - n=3: ground truth gives 2, proposed gives 4 (incorrect)
   - n=4: ground truth gives 4.5 (integer count would be 4), proposed gives 6
   - n=5: ground truth gives 8, proposed gives 8
   - n=6: ground truth gives 12.5 (integer count 12), proposed gives 10

The answers only match at n=5 and diverge elsewhere. The proposed answer doesn't match the quadratic growth expected from the problem.
