theorem omnimath4374 : 
  omnimath4374_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Prop
Given the enumerated answers pattern and the context, the answer likely involves a universal property or a closed-form characteristic. The pattern suggests the final expression is a universal quantification or a fact expressed without existential quantifiers, most probably a simple proposition.

Consolidating patterns and typical answer forms, I conjecture the answer to be a universal statement asserting something about all natural numbers.
