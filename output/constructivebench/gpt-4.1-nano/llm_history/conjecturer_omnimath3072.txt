Given the values x=3 and y=4, the expression x * y - x simplifies to 4 * 3 - 3 = 12 - 3 = 9.  
The pattern in enumerated answers suggests the answer is a constant, specifically the product y*x minus x, which is y*x - x.

The main issue with the proposed answer `(y * x) - x` is that it refers to `x` and `y` directly at the toplevel, where `abbrev` definitions do not have access to local variables or hypotheses `hx` and `hy`. The `abbrev` must be a pure expression in terms of `x` and `y`, which are variables in the goal’s context, not in the abbrev's context.

Since in the statement, `x = 3` and `y = 4`, typical to such problems, the expression `(y * x) - x` evaluates to `(4 * 3) - 3 = 12 - 3 = 9`. Therefore, the answer can be a fixed value (which is a real number) representing this evaluation.

Given the constraints, a good approach for the general answer would be to substitute `x` and `y` into the expression and produce the evaluated result, which is `12 - 3 = 9`. `abbrev` should define a constant real number, whether the number or the canonical form of the expression `y * x - x` with `x` and `y` replaced by their values.

Thus, I propose the final fixed answer:

<<<(y * x) - x>>

but before that, we need to replace `x` and `y` with their known values, yielding `4 * 3 - 3 = 9`.

In Lean, this would be:

```lean
abbrev omnimath3072_answer : ℝ := 9
```

This is the simplest closed-form answer consistent with the given hypotheses and the enumerated pattern.

**Summary of reasoning:**

- The reference version `(y * x) - x` failed because `x` and `y` are local hypotheses, not defined globally.
- To fix this, use the explicit numerical computation `12 - 3 = 9`.
- The answer is a real number, `9`, in closed form, matching the enumerated pattern and general expectations.
