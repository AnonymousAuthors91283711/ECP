Ground Truth Answer: 11
Proposed Answer: 17
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have a 3x3 magic square with odd numbers between 5 and 21 where:
   - All rows, columns, and both diagonals sum to 33 (3*11)
   - Specific values are given: square[0][0]=5, square[1][1]=9, square[2][0]=17

2. Using the given values:
   - From hrow[0]: 5 + square[0][1] + square[0][2] = 33 ⇒ square[0][1] + square[0][2] = 28
   - From hcol[0]: 5 + square[1][0] + 17 = 33 ⇒ square[1][0] = 11
   - From hdiag: 5 + 9 + square[2][2] = 33 ⇒ square[2][2] = 19
   - From hdiag: square[0][2] + 9 + 17 = 33 ⇒ square[0][2] = 7, but this contradicts the ground truth

Wait, this shows the ground truth answer of 11 cannot be correct since it would make the diagonal sum 11 + 9 + 17 = 37 ≠ 33. The proposed answer 17 would make the diagonal sum 17 + 9 + 17 = 43, which is also incorrect.

However, looking back at the problem statement, the diagonal condition is:
square 0 2 + square 1 1 + square 2 0 = 33
With square 1 1 = 9 and square 2 0 = 17, we get:
square 0 2 + 9 + 17 = 33 ⇒ square 0 2 = 7

But 7 isn't among the options. This suggests there might be an error in the problem statement or given values. The ground truth answer of 11 is mathematically incorrect based on the given constraints, and the proposed answer of 17 is also incorrect.
