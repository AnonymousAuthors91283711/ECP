Ground Truth Answer: {2, 5}
Proposed Answer: {1, 2}
Let's analyze the problem and both answers:

1. The problem asks for all natural numbers n > 0 where (n³ + 3) is divisible by (n² + 7).

2. Ground truth answer is {2, 5}:
   - For n=2: (8+3)=11, (4+7)=11 → 11%11=0 ✓
   - For n=5: (125+3)=128, (25+7)=32 → 128%32=0 ✓

3. Proposed answer is {1, 2}:
   - For n=1: (1+3)=4, (1+7)=8 → 4%8=4 ≠ 0 ✗
   - For n=2: correct as above ✓

The proposed answer incorrectly includes 1, which doesn't satisfy the condition, and misses 5 which does satisfy it.
