The pattern in the enumeration suggests the answer depends mainly on the term involving the maximum index \( n \) and the conditions on \( s \). Since \( s \) is constrained between 1 and 10 repeatedly, and \( s n = 0 \) occurs for some \( n \ge 3 \), the key is the minimal \( n \ge 3 \) where \( s n = 0 \). To maximize the size of the set of functions satisfying the conditions, the number of such functions aligns with choices for \( s \) on indices before \( n \), multiplied by the possibilities at \( n \) (which is 1, as \( s n = 0 \) fixed). Considering the maximal extension, the total count corresponds to 9 options (since \( s i \) ranges over 1 to 10), minus constraints, leading to 81, which matches \( 9^2 \).

Hence, the answer is:

<<<9 * 9>>>
