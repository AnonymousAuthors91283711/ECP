The functional equation resembles a form hinting at linear functions. The specific points suggest a symmetric relationship that implies linearity. Based on the pattern, the solution appears to be proportional to the variable, possibly involving the Golden Ratio or similar constants. Simplification and the pattern in enumerated answers indicate the answer is an integer multiple involving Fibonacci-like ratios. The consistent pattern suggests the simplest integer fit is 3.
