The recurrence resembles a shifted Fibonacci-type sequence with initial offsets: f(0)=2001, f(1)=2002, f(2)=2003. The recurrence simplifies to f(k+3)=f(k+2)+f(k+1)-f(k).  
This pattern indicates the sequence stabilizes to a linear growth pattern after initial terms. Checking the sequence, the pattern suggests the explicit formula is f(n)=n+2001.  
Thus, the answer is a linear function increasing by 1 each step, offset by 2001.
