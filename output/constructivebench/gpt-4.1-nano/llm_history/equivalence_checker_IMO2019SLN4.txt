theorem IMO2019SLN4 (C : ℕ) (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ a b : ℕ, a + b > C → (a + f b) ∣ (a^2 + b * f a)) ↔ f ∈ IMO2019SLN4_answer C := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun C => {f | ∃ k : ℕ, ∀ a : ℕ, f a = k * a}
Proposed Answer: fun C : ℕ => { f : ℕ → ℕ | ∃ c : ℕ, ∀ n : ℕ, f n = c * n }
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer and ground truth answer are equivalent. Both define the set of functions f where f(n) is a constant multiple of n (f(n) = k*n or f(n) = c*n). The only difference is the choice of variable name (k vs c), which doesn't affect the mathematical meaning. The structure and logic of both answers are identical.
