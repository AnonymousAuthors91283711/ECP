  (∃ (p q r : ℚ), p + q + r = 0 ∧ p * q * r = 1) ↔ omnimath3767_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Prop
The problem asks for an answer set characterized by an existential statement involving rationals p, q, r with algebraic relations. The enumeration hints that the solution involves symmetric relations where the sum is zero and product is one, suggesting the potential for specific triplets or parametric form. Based on pattern and symmetry, the most natural ansatz simplifies to the existence of triplets satisfying these equations, which can be directly associated with the identity p + q + r = 0 and pqr=1, thus the prop is directly characterized by such.
