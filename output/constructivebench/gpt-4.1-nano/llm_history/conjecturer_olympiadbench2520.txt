: IsLeast {x : ℕ | x > 0 ∧ ∃ y > 0, 1 / 32 = (x : ℚ) / 10 ^ y} olympiadbench2520_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The condition \(1/32 = (x : ℚ) / 10^y\) implies \(x / 10^y = 1/32\), thus \(x / 10^y = 1/32\), so \(x \times 32 = 10^y\). To minimize \(x>0\), choose the smallest \(y\) with \(10^y\) divisible by 32, which occurs at \(y=5\), giving \(x= \frac{10^5}{32} = \frac{100000}{32} = 3125\).  
  
Final answer: <<<3125>>>
