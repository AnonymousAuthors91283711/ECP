Ground Truth Answer: 5 / 2
Proposed Answer: (2 : ℝ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a function `otimes` that takes two real numbers and returns (a/b + b/a).
2. It asks to evaluate `otimes 4 8`, which would be (4/8 + 8/4).
3. Calculating this: 4/8 = 0.5 and 8/4 = 2, so 0.5 + 2 = 2.5
4. The ground truth answer is 5/2, which equals 2.5
5. The proposed answer is (2 : ℝ), which equals 2.0

The proposed answer (2.0) does not equal the correct answer (2.5). The calculation is incorrect.
