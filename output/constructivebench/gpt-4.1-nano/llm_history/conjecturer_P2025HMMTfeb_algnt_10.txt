Since a, b, c satisfy cyclic quadratic relations, the pattern suggests specific roots related to complex solutions of quadratic equations. The solutions for a, b, c are the roots of the polynomial derived from the relations, leading to roots corresponding to the roots of unity scaled appropriately. The pattern indicates the sum involves the cube roots of unity, scaled by 2.

The key insight from the problem is that the numbers \(a, b, c\) satisfy cyclical quadratic relations:

\[
a^2 = b + 6,\quad b^2 = c + 6,\quad c^2 = a + 6.
\]

From these, one can derive that the sum \(a + b + c\) corresponds to particular roots of a related polynomial, exhibiting symmetry reminiscent of the 3rd roots of unity scaled by a factor, by analogy with similar algebraic cyclic systems.

The classic roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}\), satisfying \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

Based on the pattern indicated by the problem and the typical solutions involving such symmetric cyclic relations, the sum \(a + b + c\) most plausibly takes the scaled form:

\[
2 \times \left\{ 1, \omega, \omega^2 \right\}.
\]

In Lean, the expression for the roots of unity scaled by 2 is explicit, and the correct syntax involves `exp (2 * π * complex.I / 3)` for \(\omega\), similarly for \(\omega^2\).

Since the initial code incorrectly uses the English "Since" as a start, which is not valid in Lean, the correction proceeds to directly define the set of these roots in a concise, closed-form manner.

The given proposed answer has syntax errors and incorrect usage of natural language as code, due to the phrase starting with "The key insight from" which is not valid in Lean, and the formatting of the set of roots using `finset.image` and `λ`. Also, the initial noncomputable abbrev is set to `sorry`, which is acceptable, but the goal is to provide a fixed expression for the sum \(a + b + c\) as a set.

Given the symmetry and standard result of such cyclic quadratic relations, the sum \(a + b + c\) corresponds to the scaled 3rd roots of unity, multiplied by 2, because the relations cyclically permute the roots. The third roots of unity are \(1\), \(\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}\), and \(\omega^2 = e^{4\pi i/3}\).

In Lean, the roots can be expressed as:

- \(2\) (corresponding to 1 scaled by 2),
- \(2 \times e^{2πi/3}\),
- \(2 \times e^{4πi/3}\).

Representing these explicitly:

```lean
{1, exp (2 * π * I / 3), exp (4 * π * I / 3)}
```

and scaling all by 2:

```lean
finset.image (λ k : ℤ, 2 * exp (2 * π * I / 3 * k)) {0, 1, 2}
```

which captures all three roots corresponding to the sum set.

The primary error stems from the use of 'π' which is not predefined in Lean's Mathlib as a symbol. Instead, Lean uses `Real.pi` for π, but since we're working in ℂ (complex numbers), the value of π can be taken from the complex version (via `Complex.pi`), which is typically defined as `Real.pi`. Since `π` is not predefined in the code snippet, we should import the relevant definitions or define π explicitly.

From the enumerated answers, it's clear that the presented solution set includes the three cube roots of unity: 1, \( e^{2\pi i / 3} \), and \( e^{4\pi i / 3} \). These roots of unity satisfy the key algebraic relations consistent with the given quadratic equations, suggesting that the sum \(a + b + c\) probably corresponds to a sum of roots of unity, which is known to be 0.

Therefore, instead of using `π`, we can explicitly define π as `Real.pi` and use that within `Complex.exp`, or better, directly define the roots of unity with their numerical form or using their algebraic form.

Leaning towards conciseness and correctness, the most straightforward fix is to define π explicitly as `Real.pi` in these exponential expressions, which is compatible with complex exponentials.

Thus, the final, fixed answer should be:

<<<{1, exp (2 * Real.pi * I / 3), exp (4 * Real.pi * I / 3)}>>>
