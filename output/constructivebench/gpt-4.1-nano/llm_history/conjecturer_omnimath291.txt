The problem seeks the smallest n > 0 where a permutation p exists such that for all k, (k + 1) * (p k).val is a perfect square. The pattern in enumerations suggests that the minimal such n equals the value for which the constructed set can satisfy the stated property. It involves understanding the minimal cardinality for which the condition holds. Based on typical patterns and the structure of the problem, the smallest n that satisfies this is 2, as the base case.
