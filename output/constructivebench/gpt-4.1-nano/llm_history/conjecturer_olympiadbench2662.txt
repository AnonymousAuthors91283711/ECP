The problem seeks the smallest N > 0 divisible by a certain set of conditions involving divisibility by 14 and 20. Analyzing the conditions:

- 14 | 20N implies N divisible by lcm(14, 20) / gcd(20,14) portion.
- 20 | 14N constrains N similarly.

Calculating, the least N satisfying both divisibility conditions is N = 140.

Final Lean expression:
<<<20 * 7>>>
