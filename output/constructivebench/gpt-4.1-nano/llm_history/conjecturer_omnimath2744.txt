The set s contains 5 odd integers greater than 2, multiplied to produce a number of form 10000 * a + 1000 * b + 10 * a + b, with a ≠ 0 and a ≠ b, a, b ∈ Fin 10. Since only odd n > 2 are considered, and the product factors include a in the units and tens digits, the pattern suggests the total count depends on choices for a and b with certain constraints. Recognizing the pattern of such products, the total count sums over all valid (a, b) pairs, with each contributing 1 to the count for their respective configurations. The total number of such pairs is (9 - 1) * 9, because a runs from 1 to 9 (excluding 0), and b from 0 to 9, excluding a, or equivalently 9 options for a and 9 for b (excluding when a = b). 

Thus, the total number of valid subsets is 81. 

Final expression: 

<<<81>>>
