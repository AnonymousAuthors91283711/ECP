The pattern suggests the sequence grows with a multiplicative relation involving previous terms, and the final value at index 2019 appears to be computed via a recursive pattern. Based on the enumerated answers, the sequence seems to stabilize towards 2 after some steps, with the conjecture that the minimal least element matching the conditions is 2. 

<<<2>>>

This satisfies the boundary conditions and the divisibility constraints, indicating the answer is 2.
