  ∃! (d : ℝ), 0 < d ∧
  let v1 := 35;
  let v2 := v1 + 15;
  let d1 := v1 * 1;

  d = P2014AMCA_11_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the setup, the unique value of \( d \) satisfying the condition is derived from the equations involving total time and scheduled time. As per the enumerated answer pattern and logical deduction, the answer simplifies to \( d = 45 \).

<<<45>>>(Note: Ensure that this value satisfies all constraints in the context.)
