The polynomial structure resembles a quadratic with specific relationships among coefficients driven by evaluation at 1. The sequence of nested evals corresponds to coefficients derived from the roots and coefficients that fit such a quadratic form. The maximum y occurs when the polynomial's coefficients are chosen so that the root and evals are maximized under the constraints. The pattern suggests y = (eval (eval (eval 1 P) P) P), that is, the triple nested eval at the polynomial's constant term when P has roots constructed to maximize this value. 

In this setup, the maximum value of y aligns with a quadratic polynomial where the parameters are structured for maximum eval at 1, leading to a closed form involving powers or exponential relationships. Given the pattern and typical extremal quadratic forms, the maximum is achieved when y equals 4.
