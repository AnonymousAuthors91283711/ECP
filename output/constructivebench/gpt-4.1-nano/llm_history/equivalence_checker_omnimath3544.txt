Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | ∀ d ∈ digits 10 n, d ≠ 0}
Proposed Answer:  
  { N | ∃ l : List ℕ,
      l ≠ [] ∧
      (∀ d ∈ l, 1 ≤ d ∧ d ≤ 10) ∧
      (∀ h : 0 < l.length, get l ⟨0, h⟩ ≠ 0) ∧
      N = l.foldr (fun d acc => d + 10 * acc) 0 }

The proposed answer is mostly correct but has a few differences from the ground truth:
1. The ground truth uses `digits 10 n` which automatically handles digit extraction and ordering
2. The proposed answer adds an extra condition `1 ≤ d` which is redundant since `d ≠ 0` already implies this for natural numbers
3. The proposed answer maintains the list structure and folding operation explicitly, while the ground truth uses the more abstract `digits` function

The core ideas are equivalent (numbers whose base-10 digits are all non-zero), but the formulations differ in their exact specifications.
