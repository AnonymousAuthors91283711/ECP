Ground Truth Answer: 15
Proposed Answer: 50
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have the equation: tickets + answer + arrests = 20 * warnings
2. From the hypotheses:
   - warnings = T + 2
   - tickets = 20
   - arrests = T + 5
3. Substituting into the equation:
   20 + answer + (T + 5) = 20 * (T + 2)
4. Simplify:
   answer + T + 25 = 20T + 40
5. Rearrange:
   answer = 19T + 15

The ground truth answer is 15, which would only be correct if T=0. However, there's no constraint given that forces T=0. The proposed answer is 50, which would require 19T + 15 = 50 ⇒ T ≈ 1.842, which isn't an integer.

Neither answer is generally correct, but the ground truth answer is correct when T=0, while the proposed answer is never correct for integer T. Therefore:

<<<False>>>
