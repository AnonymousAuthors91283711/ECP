The pattern suggests the goal is to find the smallest n > 0 such that P(n+23) = P(n) + 23, where P(n) is product of digits. Since the product of digits is unaffected by the carries unless zeros are involved, the minimal n satisfying the relation is n = 877, where the digit pattern allows P(n+23) = P(n) + 23. Based on the pattern and minimality, the closed-form answer is:

<<<877>>>
