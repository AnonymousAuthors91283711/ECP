The set {t | 0 < t ∧ sin(π t - π/2) = -1} involves where sin equals -1. Since sin(θ) = -1 at θ = 3π/2 + 2πk, for t > 0, t = (3π/2 + 2πk)/π = 3/2 + 2k, with k ≥ 0. The minimal positive t occurs at k=0, yielding t=1.5. Therefore, the answer is 3/2.

Considering the problem, the set {t ∈ ℝ | 0 < t ∧ sin(π t - π/2) = -1} simplifies to finding t > 0 such that sin(π t - π/2) = -1. Since sin(θ) = -1 at θ = 3π/2 + 2kπ for any integer k, setting π t - π/2 = 3π/2 + 2kπ yields t = (3π/2 + 2kπ + π/2) / π = 2 + 2k, for all integers k.

We seek the least real t > 0 satisfying this, which occurs when k = 0, giving t = 2. The minimal t > 0 from the set is thus t = 2, which is the least element satisfying the conditions.

In Lean, the problem arises due to division operations in real numbers, which require marking the definition as noncomputable or avoiding direct division syntax. The simplest fix is defining the answer as the explicit real number 2, avoiding computations that need division definitions.

Therefore, I will define:

<<<2>>>

This is a closed-form, noncomputable definition that represents the minimal t > 0 satisfying all conditions and will compile successfully in Lean.
