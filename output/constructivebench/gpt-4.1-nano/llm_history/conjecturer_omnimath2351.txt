The recurrence relation suggests a linear combination of roots with coefficients satisfying a second-order linear recurrence. Based on the pattern and initial conditions, the roots likely scale with powers of 2, and the sum of roots converges to a constant involving powers of 2. The pattern indicates the sum approaches 6.

The key insight is that the recurrence relation \( a_{n+2} = \frac{5}{2} a_{n+1} - a_n \) suggests the sequence \( a_n \) can be expressed using characteristic roots. The initial conditions \( a_1 = 3X^2 - X \) and \( a_2 = 3X^2 - 7X +3 \) imply the sequence is linear in the roots, with the roots of the characteristic polynomial governing the asymptotic behavior of the sum of roots. The recurrence's characteristic equation is \( r^2 - \frac{5}{2} r + 1 = 0 \), which has roots \( r = 1 \) and \( r = \frac{1}{2} \). Thus, the general solution is \( a_n = A \cdot 1^n + B \cdot (1/2)^n \). Since the roots of the polynomial are sums involving these sequences and the sum over roots converges as \( n \to \infty \), the sum approaches the sum associated with the dominant root, which is 1. 

Given the initial values, the limits suggest the sum over roots converges to 6, matching the pattern observed in the sequence. Accordingly, the answer is a constant limit value, which is 6. 

In Lean syntax, the formula is simply the constant 6, as the sum of roots converges to this number:
