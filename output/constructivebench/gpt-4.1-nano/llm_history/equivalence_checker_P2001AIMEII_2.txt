Ground Truth Answer: 298
Proposed Answer: (850 - 0)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the difference between maximum and minimum possible overlap (B) between two sets S and F that satisfy given constraints.

2. The ground truth answer is 298, which comes from:
   - Maximum overlap (M) occurs when S is maximized (1700) and F is maximized (800), giving B = 1700 + 800 - 2001 = 499
   - Minimum overlap (m) occurs when S is minimized (1600) and F is maximized (800), giving B = 1600 + 800 - 2001 = 399
   - Difference M - m = 499 - 399 = 100 (but wait, this contradicts the ground truth)

Wait, my initial calculation seems incorrect. Let me re-examine:

Looking at the constraints:
- S ∈ [1600,1700]
- F ∈ [600,800]
- B = S + F - 2001

For maximum B:
- We want to maximize S + F - 2001
- Maximum occurs at S=1700, F=800 → B=499

For minimum B:
- We want to minimize S + F - 2001
- Minimum occurs at S=1600, F=600 → B=199

Thus M - m = 499 - 199 = 300

But the ground truth says 298, which suggests there might be additional constraints or a different interpretation. The proposed answer (850 - 0) = 850 is clearly incorrect as it doesn't match either calculation.
