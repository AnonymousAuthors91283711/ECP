Ground Truth Answer: 32
Proposed Answer: 26
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n > 20 that satisfies:
   - 13 + (n - 20)/4 = n/2
   - (n - 20) is divisible by 4

2. For the ground truth answer (32):
   - (32 - 20)/4 = 12/4 = 3
   - 13 + 3 = 16
   - 32/2 = 16
   - Checks out

3. For the proposed answer (26):
   - (26 - 20)/4 = 6/4 = 1.5 (but must be integer)
   - Already fails the second condition (n-20)%4 = 0
   - Even if we ignore that: 13 + 1.5 = 14.5 ≠ 13 (26/2)

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy either condition, while the ground truth answer does.

<<<False>>>
