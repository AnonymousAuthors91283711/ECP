theorem olympiadbench2344 :
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | n ≠ 0 ∧
    ∃ (a r : ℝ), r ≠ 0 ∧
    let t := fun k => a * r ^ (k - 1)
    t 1 * t n = 3 ∧ ∏ k in Finset.range n, t (k + 1) = 59049}
  olympiadbench2344_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the minimal n with the terms satisfying the geometric properties. Noticing the product equals 59049, a power of 3, and the product of first and last term equals 3, the smallest such n is when n=5, with ratio r=3, and a=1. This yields the sequence 1,3,9,27,81, with product of the first and last term as 81, which matches the pattern for minimal n.
