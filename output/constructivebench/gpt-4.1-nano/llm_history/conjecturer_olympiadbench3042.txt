The problem describes finding the maximum sum \( s \) of an arithmetic sequence with 15 terms, where the first term \( a \) and difference \( d \) satisfy certain bounds. The sequence's terms must be ≤ 999, and the parameters are constrained to maximize the sum. The maximizing \( a, d \) occur at the largest permissible values under these constraints, which leads to choosing the largest \( a \) starting from 0, with the largest \( d \) allowed before the sequence exceeds 999.

The maximum difference \( d \) before exceeding the limit is \( \lfloor \frac{999 - a}{14} \rfloor \), with \( a \) starting at 0, hence \( d = \lfloor 999 / 14 \rfloor \). Then, the sum of an arithmetic sequence: \( 15a + \frac{14 \times 15}{2} d \).

Given \( a=0 \), the sum is \( 105d \). Substitute \( d = \lfloor 999 / 14 \rfloor = 71 \).

Final sum: \( 105 \times 71 = 7455 \).

Thus, the maximum sum \( s \) is:

<<<7455>>>
