Ground Truth Answer: 1/6
Proposed Answer: (5 : ℚ) / 36
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating the probability that the sum of two dice (with faces [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]) is prime.

2. First, we need to determine the total number of possible outcomes:
   - There are 6 faces on each die, so total outcomes = 6 × 6 = 36.

3. Now we need to count how many of these sums are prime:
   - Possible sums range from 2+2=4 to 13+13=26
   - Prime numbers in this range: 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23
   - We need to count how many pairs sum to each of these primes

4. Counting prime sums:
   - 5: (2,3), (3,2) → 2
   - 7: (2,5), (5,2) → 2
   - 11: (2,9) invalid (9 not on die), (3,8) invalid, (5,6) invalid, (7,4) invalid, etc.
   - Actually, looking carefully, the only valid prime sums are:
     - 5: 2 ways
     - 7: 2 ways
     - 13: (2,11), (11,2) → 2 ways
     - Total prime sums: 6

5. Probability calculation:
   - 6 favorable outcomes / 36 total outcomes = 1/6

The ground truth answer is 1/6, while the proposed answer is 5/36. These are different fractions, so the answers are not equivalent.
