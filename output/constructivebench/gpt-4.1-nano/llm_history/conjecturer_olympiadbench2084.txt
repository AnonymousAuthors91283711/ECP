abbrev olympiadbench2084_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2084 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ x y, x < f y + f (y + f x - 1) ∧ f y < x + f (y + f x - 1) ∧ f (y + f x - 1) < x + f y) ↔ f = olympiadbench2084_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The conditions impose bounds on f's values related to x and y, resembling a symmetric or additive pattern. Based on enumeration, the pattern suggests f should be linear, specifically f n = n. 

Final answer:
<<<fun n : ℕ => n>>>
