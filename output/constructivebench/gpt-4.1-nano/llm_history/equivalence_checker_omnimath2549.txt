Ground Truth Answer: fun k n => if k > 1 ∧ n > 1 then k * n else k + n
Proposed Answer: fun k n => k * (n + 1)
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer:

1. When k > 1 ∧ n > 1:
   - Ground truth: k * n
   - Proposed: k * (n + 1)
   These are clearly different (k*(n+1) > k*n when k,n>0)

2. When k = 1 or n = 1:
   - Ground truth: k + n
   - Proposed: k * (n + 1)
   These are also different (e.g., when k=1, n=2: ground truth=3, proposed=3; but when k=2, n=1: ground truth=3, proposed=4)

The proposed answer only matches the ground truth in some specific cases (like k=1, n=2) but differs in most cases. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
