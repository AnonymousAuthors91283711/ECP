theorem olympiadbench2459 (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
    (∃ a b : ℝ, (∀ x, f x = a * x + b) ∧ a ≠ 0 ∧ (∀ x, f x - invFun f x = 44)) ↔ f = olympiadbench2459_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
Given the condition \( f x - invFun f x = 44 \) and \( f(x) = a x + b \) with \( a \neq 0 \), solving for \( eval f \) yields a specific linear form. The pattern indicates the answer is linear with slope \(-1\) and intercept \(44\).
