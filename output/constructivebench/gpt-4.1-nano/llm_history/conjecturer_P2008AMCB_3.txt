The problem is about the maximum value of s such that the team can have at least 15000 per person, total sum ≤ 700000, and s = team p for some p. To maximize s, assign all to a single person, with at least 15000 per person, but total sum constraints.

. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem asks for the maximum value s such that there exists a team where some person's score is exactly s, each person's score is at least 15000, total sum is at most 700000, and the person with score s exists. To maximize s, assign as much as possible to one person, respecting the total sum constraint, and allocate the minimum (15000) to others as necessary.

Given the constraints:
- Each p player has team p ≥ 15000
- Sum over all players ≤ 700000

To maximize s, consider one person with s (say p), and the remaining 20 people each with at least 15000:

Total sum = s + 20 * 15000 ≤ 700000

Thus:

s ≤ 700000 – 20 * 15000 = 700000 – 300000 = 400000

Therefore, the maximum s is 400000.

The Lean code should directly reflect this calculation.

<<<400000>>>

This answer correctly applies the constraints, maximizes the score s for one person, and fits the problem statement logically.
