theorem omnimath652 (x y : ℕ) : 
  3^x * 4^y = 2^(x + y) + 2^(2*(x + y) - 1) ↔ (x, y) ∈ omnimath652_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 2)}
Proposed Answer: { z | z.2 = 0 ∨ z.1 = z.2 }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation is 3^x * 4^y = 2^(x+y) + 2^(2*(x+y)-1)
2. Ground truth gives specific solutions: (0,1), (1,1), (2,2)
3. Proposed answer gives a general condition: y=0 or x=y

Testing the proposed answer against ground truth:
- (0,1): y≠0 and x≠y → should be excluded but is in ground truth
- (1,1): x=y → included in both
- (2,2): x=y → included in both

The proposed answer misses (0,1) which is a valid solution, and would include many invalid pairs like (1,0), (2,0), (3,3), etc. that don't satisfy the original equation.
