Ground Truth Answer: 16
Proposed Answer: (4 : ℤ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the greatest integer d that can be expressed as the discriminant (b² - 4ac) of a quadratic polynomial f(x) = ax² + bx + c with three distinct integer roots u, v, w where f(u)=0, f(v)=0, and f(w)=2.

2. The ground truth answer is 16. This is correct because:
   - The maximal discriminant occurs when the polynomial has two roots where it equals 0 and another point where it equals 2
   - One such polynomial is f(x) = -2x² + 0x + 16, which gives discriminant 0² - 4*(-2)*16 = 128, but this doesn't satisfy the root conditions
   - The correct maximal case is f(x) = -x² + 2x + 3 with roots at x=-1 (f(-1)=0), x=3 (f(3)=0), and x=1 (f(1)=2), giving discriminant 2² - 4*(-1)*3 = 16

3. The proposed answer is 4, which is incorrect as it's smaller than the maximal possible discriminant of 16 that satisfies all conditions.
