theorem olympiadbench3090 (k : ℕ) (r s : ℝ) :
  fib (k + 2) + fib (k + 1) * r + fib k * r^2 = 0 ∧
  fib (k + 2) + fib (k + 1) * s + fib k * s^2 = 0 → 
  (r + 1) * (s + 1) = olympiadbench3090_answer k := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The quadratic equation for r, s is derived from Fibonacci coefficients; roots relate to fib(k+1)/fib(k). The sum of roots r + s = - (fib(k+1))/fib(k). Hence, (r+1)(s+1) = rs + r + s + 1, which simplifies to (fib(k+1)/fib(k))^2 - (fib(k+1)/fib(k)) + 1 = 2, following pattern from enumerated answers. 
Final expression:

<<<fun k : ℕ => 2 * (fib (k + 1)) * fib k>>>
