Given the problem's context and standard results related to the vertices of regular polygons on the complex unit circle, the condition that the sum of vectors \( z_i \) is zero while each is of norm 1 essentially restricts \( n \) to be 2. This aligns with the fact that for \( n > 2 \), the sum of equally spaced roots of unity on the circle cannot sum to zero unless \( n=2 \). 

The key insight is that the maximum \( n \) satisfying the condition is 2. 

From the pattern, the answer — which is a natural number \( n \) satisfying the greatest property — should be a concrete value, 2. The answer in Lean should be a constant value, not involving an unknown identifier or an essay.

Thus, the fixed answer in Lean is:

<<<2>>>

This is a simple, closed-form, generalized answer reflecting the pattern identified from the problem analysis.
