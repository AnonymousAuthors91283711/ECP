Given the consistent pattern, the answer for the 10th student (s=9) and the total number of problems seems to be the sum of the fixed overlaps minus the overlaps for the previous students:

- 4 solutions per problem among students 1..8
- 7 solutions per problem among students 0..9
- For s=9, overlaps are likely to be the sum: 4*8 + 3, which simplifies to 35

Final answer: <<<35>>>
