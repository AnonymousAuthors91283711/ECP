Given proportional wins and total games, the number of games Bingyi wins is computed as: (total games / 3) * (1 - 0.2) + (total games / 3) * 0.6 + (total games / 3) * (1 - 0.4) , simplified to total_games / 3 * (0.8 + 0.6 + 0.6).

Calculating:
(60 / 3) * (0.8 + 0.6 + 0.6) = 20 * 2 = 40.

<<<20 * 2>>>
