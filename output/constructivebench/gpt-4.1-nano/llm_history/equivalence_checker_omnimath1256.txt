  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 1000 < n ∧ n < 2000 ∧ ∀ k ∈ ({2,3,4,5,6,7,8} : Set ℕ), n % k = 1} omnimath1256_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 41
Proposed Answer: 1001
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
1. We need to find the smallest natural number n between 1000 and 2000 such that:
   - n ≡ 1 mod k for all k ∈ {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
2. This means n-1 must be divisible by the LCM of {2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

Calculations:
1. LCM of {2,3,4,5,6,7,8} is 840
2. We need n = 840m + 1 where 1000 < n < 2000
3. The smallest such n would be when m=2: 840*2 + 1 = 1681

Ground Truth Answer Analysis:
- 41 is clearly incorrect as it's not between 1000 and 2000

Proposed Answer Analysis:
- 1001 is between 1000 and 2000
- Let's check the conditions:
  1001 % 2 = 1 ✔
  1001 % 3 = 2 ✖ (should be 1)
  So 1001 doesn't satisfy all conditions

Conclusion:
Neither answer is correct, but they are both incorrect in different ways.
