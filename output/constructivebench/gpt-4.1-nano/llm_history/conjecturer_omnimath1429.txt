theorem omnimath1429 :
  let p_H := (1 : ℝ)/4
  let p_M := (1 : ℝ)/2
  let p_T := (1 : ℝ)/4
    let E := 1 + p_H * E + p_M * (1 + p_H * E + p_M * 0 + p_T * E) + p_T * E
  E = omnimath1429_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The problem resembles a weighted expectation calculation involving conditional probabilities, similar to a recursive expectation structure. The pattern suggests that the total expectation converges to a fixed point involving the probabilities. Given the weights and recursive structure, the solution aligns with calculating the expected value as a weighted average: (1 + expected value), scaled by the total probabilities. Solving the fixed point yields 2. 

Thus, the expected answer is 2.
