The pattern shows that for \( p \neq q \) primes, \( p^2 q^2 < 1000 \), so candidate pairs are small primes. The key is to count all such products under 1000. The primes up to about 31 satisfy \( p^2 q^2 < 1000 \) when \( p, q \neq \).

The enumeration suggests that these products correspond to all pairs \( p < q \) where \( p, q \) are primes with \( p^2 q^2 < 1000 \).

Counting these pairs yields 6 total.

Thus, the number of elements in \( P \) (the cardinality) is 6.

<<<6>>>
