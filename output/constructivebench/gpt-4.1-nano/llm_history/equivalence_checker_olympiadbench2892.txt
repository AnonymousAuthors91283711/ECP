Ground Truth Answer: 2604
Proposed Answer: 2049
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a unique number n between 2009 and 3009 where:
   - The sum of its odd divisors equals 1024
   - The ground truth answer is 2604
   - The proposed answer is 2049

2. Checking the proposed answer 2049:
   - 2049 is indeed between 2009 and 3009
   - Its prime factorization is 3 × 683
   - Odd divisors: {1, 3, 683, 2049}
   - Sum of odd divisors: 1 + 3 + 683 + 2049 = 2736 ≠ 1024

3. Checking the ground truth answer 2604:
   - 2604's prime factorization is 2² × 3 × 7 × 31
   - Odd divisors: {1, 3, 7, 21, 31, 93, 217, 651}
   - Sum: 1 + 3 + 7 + 21 + 31 + 93 + 217 + 651 = 1024

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the condition (sum of odd divisors ≠ 1024), while the ground truth does.
