theorem omnimath3788 (f : ℤ → ℤ) :
  (∀ x y, f (4 * x + 3 * y) = f (3 * x + y) + f (x + 2 * y)) ↔ 
  ∃ a, f = omnimath3788_answer a := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a x => a * x
Proposed Answer: fun a b : ℤ => a * b + a + b
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is asking about characterizing all integer functions f that satisfy the given functional equation.

2. The ground truth answer suggests that the only solutions are linear functions of the form f(x) = a*x.

3. The proposed answer suggests solutions of the form f(a,b) = a*b + a + b.

Key differences:
- The ground truth is a univariate function (f(x) = a*x) while the proposed answer is bivariate (f(a,b))
- The proposed answer doesn't match the form required by the problem statement (which asks for ℤ → ℤ functions)
- The proposed answer includes quadratic and linear terms, while the correct solution is purely linear

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It doesn't match the required function type
2. It doesn't satisfy the given functional equation
3. It's not equivalent to the linear solution

<<<False>>>
