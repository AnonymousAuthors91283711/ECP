  let S : Finset ℚ := {0, 1/2, 1}
  let Ω := Fin 6 → S
  let total := 3^6

The key is that the probability involves the product of the first three and last three values, with an additional factor in the last term. Since the set S contains 3 values, and the conditions are symmetric, the favorable cases relate to the proportion where the products' floor values match. Because each f(i) is independently and uniformly chosen from S, the probability is given by the ratio of favorable to total outcomes. The consistent pattern suggests the favorable ratio is 1/3.
