The pattern suggests the solutions occur when the sum of two powers of two equals a factorial — notably, small factorials like 2! and 3! fit this pattern with small exponents:

- 2^1 + 2^1 = 2 + 2 = 4 = 4! / 6, unlikely, but for 2! and 3!:

- 2^1 + 2^2 = 2 + 4 = 6 = 3! 

and

- 2^2 + 2^2= 4 + 4=8 not factorial

but only 6 matches 3!:

- 2^1 + 2^2 = 6 = 3!

Similarly, for 2! = 2, and 3! = 6, only the pairs (a, b):

(1, 2) and (2, 1):

- 2^1 + 2^2 = 6

- 2^2 + 2^1 = 6

No higher solutions seem apparent for larger factorials. Therefore, the total solutions are:

- Pairs with (a, b) ∈ {(1, 2), (2, 1)} for c=3.

Total solutions: 2.

Thus, expected answer:

<<<2>>>
