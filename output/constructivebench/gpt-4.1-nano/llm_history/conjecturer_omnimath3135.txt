theorem omnimath3135 :
  let S : Finset ℤ := {-3, -1, 0, 2, 4}
  let pairs := (S ×ˢ S).filter (fun (a, b) => a ≠ b)
  let favorable := pairs.filter (fun (a, b) => a * b = 0)
  (favorable.card : ℚ) / pairs.card = omnimath3135_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The set S has 5 elements. Pairs are all ordered pairs minus the diagonals, with 20 total pairs. Favorable pairs are those where a * b = 0, i.e., when a = 0 or b = 0, but not both simultaneously since a ≠ b. Count of pairs with a=0 or b=0 (excluding diagonals):

pairs with a=0: 4 pairs (excluding (0,0))
pairs with b=0: 4 pairs (excluding (0,0))
Total favorable: 8 pairs.

Ratio = 8/20 = 2/5.

Expression in Lean: <<<2/5>>>
