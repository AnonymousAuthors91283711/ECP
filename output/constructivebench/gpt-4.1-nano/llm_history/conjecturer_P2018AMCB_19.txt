The problem seeks the least divisor \(d\) related to numbers \(n\) with specified properties, likely stabilized in the sorted divisor list with 323 at position \(k\) and the next divisor as \(d\). The pattern hints at the minimal divisor after 323 for such \(n\). Since the divisors are sorted, the answer is the immediate next divisor after 323 for some \(n\). For \(n\) such that 323 divides \(n\), their next divisor after 323 would be the smallest divisor greater than 323, i.e., 324, provided it divides \(n\). Considering the divisor structure and the minimal element behavior, the minimal \(d\) satisfying the conditions is 324.
