The polynomial roots relate to symmetric sums: a + b + c, ab + bc + ca, and abc, derived from coefficients. The roots satisfy the relations in the polynomial, and the sums of squares are expressible via these symmetric sums. From enumeration, the pattern suggests the answer is an affine function of T. Given the coefficients, the roots' sum is 20, and the sum of squares involves a linear and quadratic relation in T.

Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 52, which is at "T + 203)/2" in "abbrev olympiadbench3027_answer : ℚ → ℚ := (T^2 + 20T + 203)/2", there is an error: unexpected identifier; expected ')', ',' or ':'.

The error indicates that the expression `(T^2 + 20T + 203)/2` is invalid as an abbreviation because Lean expects a function of type `ℚ → ℚ`, but the expression as written is just an expression depending on a variable `T`. To define a function, I need to write a lambda abstraction: `fun T => ...`.

Additionally, looking at the candidate answer `(T^2 + 20T + 203)/2`, it is a straightforward quadratic in `T`, which is valid as long as it's encapsulated as a function: `fun T => (T^2 + 20*T + 203)/2`.

Given the context—coefficients of the polynomial—this candidate formula probably computes `a^2 + b^2 + c^2` based on the parameter `T`. This matches expectations for formulating a closed-form solution as a function of `T`.

Therefore, the correct Lean code should be:

`abbrev olympiadbench3027_answer : ℚ → ℚ := fun T => (T^2 + 20*T + 203)/2`

which should fix the syntax error.
