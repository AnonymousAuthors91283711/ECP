Since the polynomial is monic degree 4 with evaluations at specific points, the pattern suggests the polynomial resembles \(f(x) = -x^2\), given the values: \(f(-1) = -1\), \(f(2) = -4\), \(f(-3) = -9\), \(f(4) = -16\). These fit \(f(x) = -x^2\) exactly, satisfying all points. Therefore, \(f(1) = -1^2 = -1\).
