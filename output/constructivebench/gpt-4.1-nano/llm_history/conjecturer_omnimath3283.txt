theorem omnimath3283 :
  ∀ (f : ℚ → ℚ), (∀ x y : ℚ, (f (x + y) - f x - f y) ∈ (algebraMap ℤ ℚ).range) → 
  (∃ (c : ℚ), ∀ x : ℚ, (f x - c * x) ∈ (algebraMap ℤ ℚ).range) ↔ omnimath3283_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Bool
<<<true>>>

Explanation: The condition implies f is additive up to an integer coefficient, leading to the existence of c such that f x - c * x is integer-valued. The answer is true.
