The sum involves the square of the count of prime factors less than 6 for \( n \) from 0 to 2020. Prime factors less than 6 are 2, 3, 5. For each number, count how many of these primes divide it, then square that. Since the primes are independent, the sum counts how many \( n \) are divisible by these primes in conjunction, related to binomial relations. The pattern suggests the total sum resembles the sum over the counts squared, i.e., the sum of all squared binomial coefficients for prime factors counts. The summation resembles summing the squares of binomial coefficients over all partitions into primes less than 6.

Final lean expression:

<<<(2^3) * (2020 + 1) * 3 >>>

because e.g., the pattern of factors indicates the total involves powers of 2 (the count of primes less than 6, which is 3), multiplied by suitable counts, simplified for this large range.

Note: This is a heuristic conclusion, assuming uniform distribution over the primes' contribution, leading to the simplified closed-form.
