    (b + (b + 1) + (b + 2) + (b + 3) + (b + 4)) / 5 = P2014AMCA_9_answer a b := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
Given the sum of five consecutive integers starting at a, b is their average, and the second sum is 5b plus the sum of 0 to 4.

The sum from a to a+4 is 5a + 10, so b = a + 2.

Total sum from b to b+4 is 5b + 10, averaging to b+2.

Thus, answer is (a + 2) + 2 = a + 4.
