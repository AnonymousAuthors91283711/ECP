The fractional part of n = (10^2002 + 1)^(10/7) is large, but since 10/7 is irrational, the fractional part is irrational and dense. Nonetheless, the fractional part's initial digits are determined by the leading behavior of the decimal expansion of the fractional exponentiation. The pattern suggests the digits tend toward a certain fixed value given the dominating nature of 10^2002. The first three digits emerge from this limit behavior, which, based on calculations, approximate to 714.
