Based on the pattern, the set S contains all integers obtained by repeatedly multiplying by 3 and then adding 1, starting from 0, thus generating numbers of the form 3^k - 1. The cardinality up to 2008 corresponds to the count of such numbers less than 2008, which are 3^k - 1 < 2008, i.e., 3^k < 2009. The minimal k satisfying this is k=6, since 3^6=729<2009 and 3^7=2187>2009, so k=6. The total count is k=6 because the sequence includes 3^0-1=0, 3^1-1=2, 3^2-1=8, 3^3-1=26, 3^4-1=80, 3^5-1=242. 

Final answer: <<<6>>>
