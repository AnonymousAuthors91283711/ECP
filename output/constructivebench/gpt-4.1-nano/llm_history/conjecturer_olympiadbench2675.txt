The sequence a n grows based on the recurrence a(n+1) = ceil(sqrt(a(n)^2 + 34)).  
Approximating a(n), a(1)=1, and as it increases roughly linearly, a(n) ≈ √(34)*n.  
To find minimal n with a(n) > 100*T=500, solve √(34)*n > 500 ⇒ n > 500/√34.  
Since √34 ≈ 5.83, n > 500/5.83 ≈ 85.8.  
Thus, minimal n=86.  

Answer: <<<86>>>
