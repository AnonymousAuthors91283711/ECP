Given the pattern and the factorial conditions, the solution set corresponds to triples where each product plus one equals a factorial, specifically for small values due to factorial growth. The pattern highlights triples, such as (1,1,1), (1,2,2), (2,1,2), and (2,2,1), satisfying these conditions.

Therefore, the answer set is the set of triples where each element is either 1 or 2, and the products plus one match factorial values, i.e., 2 or 3.

The core idea is to characterize the set of triples \((a, b, c)\) for which each of \(a \times b + 1\), \(b \times c + 1\), and \(c \times a + 1\) is a factorial. The growth of factorial restricts the solutions to small values, and based on small checks, the solutions are triples where each variable is either 1 or 2.

For instance:
- If \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), then \(a \times b + 1 = 2\), which is \(2!\).
- If \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\), then \(a \times b + 1= 3\), which is \(3!\), but 3 is not a factorial. So only \(a=1, b=1\) or \(a=2, b=1\) or similar small combos with factorials fitting.

Testing small values shows the valid triples are \((1, 1, 1)\), \((1, 2, 2)\), \((2, 1, 2)\), and \((2, 2, 1)\). Changing any variable outside \(\{1, 2\}\) causes products plus one to not be a factorial because factorials grow rapidly.

Thus, the set of solutions is exactly those 4 triples.

No 'given' or verbose comments are needed; directly define the set in Lean.
