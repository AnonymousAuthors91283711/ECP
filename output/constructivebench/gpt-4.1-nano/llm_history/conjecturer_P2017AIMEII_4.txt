The problem counts numbers from 1 to 2017 whose digits are all non-zero. The number of such integers can be computed by considering 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit numbers with no zeros: 

- 1-digit: 9 options (1-9)
- 2-digit: 9×9 = 81 options
- 3-digit: 9×9×9 = 729 options
- 4-digit: 9×9×9×9 = 6561 options, but only up to 2017, so count 4-digit numbers less than or equal to 2017 with all non-zero digits.

Numbers up to 2017 with all digits ≥1 are:

- 1-3 digit numbers: all 1- to 3-digit numbers with non-zero digits (total: 9 + 81 + 729)
- 4-digit numbers between 1000 and 1999 with non-zero digits: each digit from 1-9, with the first digit fixed at 1. The remaining three digits: 9 options each, total 9×9×9=729.
- 2000-2017 range: only numbers with first digit 2, second digit 0-1 (as 2017 max), but only digits ≥1, so the 0 in '2000' isn't permitted, so only 2001-2017 are valid? Wait, 2001-2009: digits are 2, 0/1,..., but zero not allowed? So only 2001-2009 with all non-zero digits? 2001 has zero, so invalid. 2002-2009: zeros, invalid. 201x: 2010-2017, again zeros appear, so no.
 
Finally, only the numbers from 1 to 2017 with all non-zero digits are: 
- 1,2,3,...,9 (1-digit): 9.
- 10-99 with digits ≥1: total 81.
- 100-999: total 729.
- 1000-1999: total 9×9×9=729.
- 2000-2099: only 2001-2009 possible, but all contain zeros; zeros are not allowed, so none.
- 2100-2199, ... and so on, zeros appear again, so no further.

Total sum: 9 + 81 + 729 + 729 = 1548.

Thus, the total count is:

<<<(9 + 81 + 729 + 729)>>>

which simplifies to:

<<<1538>>>

But correctly summing is: 9 + 81 + 729 + 729 = 1548. 

Therefore, final answer:

<<<1548>>>
