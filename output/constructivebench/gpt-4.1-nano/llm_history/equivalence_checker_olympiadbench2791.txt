Ground Truth Answer: -50
Proposed Answer: -225
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for an integer k (olympiadbench2791_answer) such that the polynomial X^4 + kX^2 + ... can be factored into four distinct linear terms in arithmetic progression (with differences ±d, ±3d).

2. The ground truth answer is -50, which is correct because:
   - When you expand (X-(a-3d))(X-(a-d))(X-(a+d))(X-(a+3d)), the X^2 coefficient becomes 6a² - 10d²
   - The constant term (from expansion) is (a²-9d²)(a²-d²) = 225
   - Solving these equations leads to k = -50

3. The proposed answer is -225, which is incorrect because:
   - It doesn't satisfy the polynomial identity when expanded
   - It would require different relationships between a and d that don't match the given factorization structure
