The set consists of n in [4..2014], with n ≡ 4 mod 5, and the sum of digits of n is even. The pattern suggests roughly 1/5 of integers satisfy n ≡ 4 mod 5, and among these, the digit sum parity condition roughly halves the count. Total count is approximately (2014-4+1)/5 ≈ 403, halved to about 201.
