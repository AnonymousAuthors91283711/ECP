open Set Function Real

noncomputable abbrev olympiadbench1998_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench1998 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hf : ∀ x, 0 < x → 0 < f x) :
  (∀ x > 0, ∃! y > 0, x * f y + y * f x ≤ 2) ↔ f = olympiadbench1998_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
The pattern suggests the answer is the constant function \(f(x) = 1\), satisfying the inequality with equality when \(f(x) = 1\).  
Final Lean expression:
<<< fun x => 1 >>>
