  3 * 5 + 2 * 8 = P2006AMCA_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern 3*5 + 2*8, the sums suggest a pattern of a sum of products involving small fixed coefficients times small integers, possibly resulting in a quadratic form. Calculating directly: 3*5 + 2*8 = 15 + 16 = 31. The pattern of coefficients (3,2) and numbers (5,8) hints toward a general formula. Based on the pattern, the answer is likely 31.
