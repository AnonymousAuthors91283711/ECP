The solutions to 2 * x^2 = 9 * x - 4 are quadratic roots: x = 2, x = 1/2; since x ≠ 4, no restriction on these roots. The expression 2x simplifies to either 4 or 1. Based on the solutions, the two possible values are 4 and 1, with 2x being either 4 or 1. Therefore, the answer encompasses these values; deducing from the structure, the intended answer aligns with the maximum plausible simplified value 4. 

<<<4>>>
