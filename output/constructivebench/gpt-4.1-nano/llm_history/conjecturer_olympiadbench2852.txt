The given set describes k such that all functions have squares equal to their product, likely constant functions. To minimize k with these conditions, the smallest such k satisfying the properties is 2, since for k=2, functions satisfying all properties exist (e.g., constants). Larger k would also satisfy but for the least, k=2.
