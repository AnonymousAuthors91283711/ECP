Ground Truth Answer: 73 / 1225
Proposed Answer: ( (12 * 3) + 1 ) / (50 * 49 / 2)
Let's analyze both answers carefully:

1. Ground Truth Answer: 73/1225
2. Proposed Answer: ( (12 * 3) + 1 ) / (50 * 49 / 2)

First, let's simplify the proposed answer:
Numerator: (12 * 3) + 1 = 36 + 1 = 37
Denominator: 50 * 49 / 2 = 1225
So proposed answer simplifies to 37/1225

Now let's verify the ground truth calculation:
- Total pairs: 50*49/2 = 1225 (matches denominator)
- Same label pairs:
  - For first 12 labels (4 cards each): 12 * (4 choose 2) = 12 * 6 = 72
  - For last label (2 cards): (2 choose 2) = 1
  - Total same label pairs: 72 + 1 = 73
- Probability: 73/1225

The proposed answer incorrectly calculates the numerator as 37 instead of 73. The error comes from calculating (12 * 3) instead of (12 * 6) for the first part.
