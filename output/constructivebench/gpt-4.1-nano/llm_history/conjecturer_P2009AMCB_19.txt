The polynomial \(f(n) = n^4 - 360 n^2 + 400\) factors as \((n^2 - 20)^2\), which is a perfect square and usually composite unless \(n^2 - 20 = \pm 1\). The prime values occur only when \(n^2 - 20 = \pm 1\), i.e., \(n^2 = 21\) (not a perfect square). No integer \(n\) makes \(f(n)\) prime. Therefore, the sum over primes is empty, and the answer should be 0.

Current Proposed Answer: The polynomial \(f(n) = n^4 - 360 n^2 + 400\) factors as \((n^2 - 20)^2\), which is a perfect square and usually composite unless \(n^2 - 20 = \pm 1\).

The error message indicates that in the definition of `P2009AMCB_19_answer`, there is an unexpected token `'('`, which suggests that I incorrectly used a syntax pattern that Lean does not permit in an `abbrev` definition. The `abbrev` should define a constant value, specifically a natural number, avoiding any complex expression syntax that Lean cannot interpret as a constant.

Given the reasoning, the polynomial \(f(n) = n^4 - 360 n^2 + 400\) is analyzed to find prime values. Because it factors as \((n^2 - 20)^2\), which is a perfect square, the only way \(f(n)\) could be prime is if the square root \(n^2 - 20\) equals \(\pm 1\)—but this doesn't yield integer solutions for \(n\). Therefore, for all integer \(n\), \(f(n)\) is composite.

Hence, the sum over the primes is empty, and the answer should be `0`.

Because we need a fixed natural number constant, let’s set the value explicitly as `0`.

Final answer in Lean syntax:

<<<0>>>

This defines `P2009AMCB_19_answer` as `0`, the sum over the set of prime \(f(n)\) when \(f(n)\) is prime, which is empty for this polynomial.

**Note:** The reasoning is that no primes satisfy the condition, so we sum over an empty set, resulting in zero.
