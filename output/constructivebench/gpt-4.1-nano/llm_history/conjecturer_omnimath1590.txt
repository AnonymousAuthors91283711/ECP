The equation equates the integer part of \(\frac{100 n}{101}\) to the ceiling of \(\frac{99 n}{100}\). Analyzing the ranges where this holds suggests the solution set is precisely the integers \(n\) such that these two values coincide, which happens at the boundary points where the floors and ceilings meet. Based on pattern and symmetry, the answer is proportional to the interval length between these boundary points, resulting in \( \boxed{1} \).
