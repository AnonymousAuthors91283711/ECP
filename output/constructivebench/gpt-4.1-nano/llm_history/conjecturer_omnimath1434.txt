The expression suggests the limit involving (n * r * sqrt(1 - cos(2π/n))) as n → ∞ tends to zero, since 1 - cos(2π/n) ≈ (2π/n)^2/2 for small angles. Multiplying by n gives approximately n * r * (π/n) = r * π, but as n→∞, the square root term vanishes. The limit approaches 0, thus the closed form is 0.
