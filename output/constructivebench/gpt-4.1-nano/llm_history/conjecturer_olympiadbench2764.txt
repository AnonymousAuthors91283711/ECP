The function’s numerator factors as (x² - 3x + 1)², and the denominator is always positive, so the range of f is all real numbers obtained from these squares. The minimal value of the numerator occurs at x = 3/2, giving numerator ( (3/2)^2 - 3*(3/2) + 1 )^2 = (-0.25)^2 = 0.0625, and the denominator at x=3/2 is ( (3/2)^2 + 1 ) = 13/4. So minimal y is approx 0.0625 / (13/4) ≈ 0.0625 * 4/13 = 1/52, which is positive but not an integer, so the minimal integer y in the range is 0. Checking y=0, there exists x such that numerator = 0 and denominator ≠ 0, so f(x) = 0. Since 0 is the least integer in the range, the range’s minimum integer value is 0. 

Final answer:
<<<0>>>
