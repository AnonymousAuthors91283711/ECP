The polynomial resembles a fourth-degree polynomial that might factor into quadratics with roots related to roots of unity or conjugates. Patterns suggest roots possibly on the unit circle, with real or complex conjugates. Based on these hints, the roots are \( x = -1, i, -i, \) and \( -1 \). 

In Lean, the set of roots can be expressed as the union of these roots.
