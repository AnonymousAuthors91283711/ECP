Given the constraints, the set B must cover all elements via B ∪ B.image f, with a minimal cardinality. Since f has no fixed points, each element and its image form pairs that cover the set succinctly. The minimal such B needs at least half the elements to ensure coverage. With 100 elements, the minimal B size is 50 to satisfy the conditions with the union and image.
