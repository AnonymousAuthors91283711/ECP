The given cubic equation is \(m^3 = n^3 + 2n^2 + 9n + 8\). Factoring the right side:  
\(n^3 + 2n^2 + 9n + 8 = (n+1)^3 + 6n + 1\).  
Analyzing for integer \(m\), the solutions are \(n = -1\), since substitution yields \(m^3 = 0 \Rightarrow m=0\).  
Hence, the only \(n\) satisfying the condition is \(-1\).  
Final answer set: \(\{-1\}\).

The key points in the problem are:
- The set is of natural numbers ℕ, i.e., non-negative integers starting from 0.
- The candidate answer currently is `{ -1 }`, which is invalid because `-1` is not a natural number, hence the error "failed to synthesize Neg ℕ".

Given the equation:
\[ m^3 = n^3 + 2n^2 + 9n + 8 \]
and that `n` must be in ℕ, the solution appears to involve identifying all `n` that satisfy this equality.

Let's test small non-negative integers `n` to find solutions:
- For `n=0`:
  \[ m^3 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 8 = 8 \]
  \[ m = 2 \]
  solution: `n=0`, `m=2`

- For `n=1`:
  \[ m^3 = 1 + 2 + 9 + 8 = 20 \]
  20 is not a perfect cube, no solution.

- For `n=2`:
  \[ m^3 = 8 + 8 + 18 + 8 = 42 \], not a cube.

- For `n=3`:
  \[ m^3 = 27 + 18 + 27 + 8 = 80 \], not a cube.

- For `n=4`:
  \[ m^3=64 + 32 + 36 + 8= 140 \], not a cube.

- For `n=5`:
  \[ m^3=125 + 50 + 45 + 8= 228 \], not a cube.

Similarly for larger `n` the right side increases and does not match perfect cubes.

Thus, the only solution in ℕ is at `n=0`. The associated `m=2` satisfies the equation, so the set should be `{0}`.

*Conclusion:* The set of such `n` in ℕ satisfying the condition is `{0}`.

Final answer must be an explicit set of natural numbers, which in Lean is:
```lean
{0}
```

And since `abbrev omnimath1452_answer : Set ℕ := {0}`, the authoritative fix is:

<<<{0}>>>

This fixes the type error by providing a set of ℕ, avoiding negative numbers, and matching the solution derived through testing.
