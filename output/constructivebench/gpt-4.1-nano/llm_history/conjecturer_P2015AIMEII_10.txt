Based on the pattern, the set describes permutations of 7 elements with closely bounded orderings, suggesting a sequence related to factorial or Catalan structures. Given the enumeration, the answer appears to reflect permutations with specific constraints, which are often counted as binomial coefficient or factorial ratios. Noting that the data point aligns with central binomial coefficients, the simplest closed form for the larger count is 42, aligning with common combinatorial counts for similar "almost increasing" permutations in size 7.
