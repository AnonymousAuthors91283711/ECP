The pattern in enumerated answers suggests the count of numbers where the count of digit 1 in base 2 representation remains unchanged after adding 1, within the range 1 to 2002. This occurs typically for numbers ending with a 0 in binary (causing a flip in bits). The count of such numbers up to 2002 is 501, reflecting the number of binary numbers ending with 0/1 in a specific pattern. 

Thus, the closed-form answer is 501.

<<<501>>>
