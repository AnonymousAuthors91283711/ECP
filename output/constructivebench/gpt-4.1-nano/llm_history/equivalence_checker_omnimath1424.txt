Ground Truth Answer: 738826
Proposed Answer: 2 * factorial 9 + factorial 8 + factorial 6 + factorial 4 + 2
Let's evaluate both expressions to see if they're equivalent.

First, let's compute the ground truth value:
8 * (9!) / 4 + 4 * (7!) / 2 + 4 * (6!) + 4 * (4!) + 3! + 2! + 2!
= 2 * 9! + 2 * 7! + 4 * 6! + 4 * 4! + 6 + 2 + 2
= 725760 + 10080 + 2880 + 96 + 10
= 738826

Now let's compute the proposed answer:
2 * 9! + 8! + 6! + 4! + 2
= 725760 + 40320 + 720 + 24 + 2
= 766826

The results are different (738826 ≠ 766826), so the answers are not equivalent.
