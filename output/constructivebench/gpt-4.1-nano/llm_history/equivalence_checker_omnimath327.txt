Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n - 3
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n/2 + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal number of vertices in a graph of size n=1982 where every 4-vertex subset contains a vertex connected to all others in that subset.

2. The ground truth answer suggests that for any n, the minimal number is n-3. This makes sense because:
   - We need to ensure that for any 4 vertices, one is connected to the other three
   - The worst case would be having n-3 vertices that are "universally connected" (connected to all others)
   - The remaining 3 vertices might not be universally connected, but any 4-vertex subset must include at least one of the n-3 universally connected vertices

3. The proposed answer suggests n/2 + 1, which:
   - Gives a much smaller number (992 for n=1982 vs 1979)
   - Doesn't match our intuition about needing nearly all vertices to be universally connected
   - Would be insufficient to guarantee the condition for all 4-vertex subsets

The proposed answer is incorrect as it gives a significantly smaller value than needed to satisfy the graph condition.
