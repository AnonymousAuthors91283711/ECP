Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: 19
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for three distinct digits P, Q, R (each between 0 and 9) that satisfy a specific equation:
   - The equation translates to: (100P + 70 + R) + (300 + 90 + R) = 100R + 10Q
   - Simplifying: 100P + 460 + 2R = 100R + 10Q
   - Rearranged: 100P + 460 = 100R - 2R + 10Q → 100P + 460 = 98R + 10Q

2. The ground truth answer is 13, meaning P + Q + R = 13 for the valid solution.

3. The proposed answer is 19, meaning P + Q + R = 19 for the valid solution.

4. Let's find the actual solution:
   - Trying R=6: 100P + 460 = 588 + 10Q → 100P = 128 + 10Q → P=1, Q=2.8 (invalid)
   - R=7: 100P + 460 = 686 + 10Q → 100P = 226 + 10Q → P=2, Q=2.6 (invalid)
   - R=8: 100P + 460 = 784 + 10Q → 100P = 324 + 10Q → P=3, Q=2.4 (invalid)
   - R=9: 100P + 460 = 882 + 10Q → 100P = 422 + 10Q → P=4, Q=2.2 (invalid)
   - R=5: 100P + 460 = 490 + 10Q → 100P = 30 + 10Q → P=0, Q=3 (valid)
     - Then P=0, Q=3, R=5 → sum=8 (but digits must be distinct and P<10,Q<10,R<10)
   - R=6 seems to be the closest to integer solutions, but none work perfectly.

5. The ground truth answer of 13 doesn't seem to match any valid solution, while the proposed answer of 19 is even further from any possible solution.

6. Both answers appear incorrect based on the equation analysis, but the ground truth is closer to plausible values.
