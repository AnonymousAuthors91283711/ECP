This problem involves counting permutations on Fin 7 with exactly 6 fixed points, and dividing by total permutations. For a permutation with exactly 6 fixed points, the remaining element must be a non-fixed point, so it forms a 1-cycle. The total permutations are 7!, and fixed point permutations are 7 * 6! because choose which 6 are fixed, and permute the last element.

Answer: \( \frac{7 \times 6!}{7!} = \frac{7 \times 720}{5040} = \frac{1}{\!1} \).
