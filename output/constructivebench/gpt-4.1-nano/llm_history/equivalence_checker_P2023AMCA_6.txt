Ground Truth Answer: 4 * sqrt 5
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two positive real numbers x₁ and x₂ with:
   - Sum of base-2 logs equals 4
   - Sum of the numbers equals 12

2. We can derive:
   From h₁: log₂(x₁x₂) = 4 ⇒ x₁x₂ = 2⁴ = 16
   From h₂: x₁ + x₂ = 12

3. The difference |x₁ - x₂| can be found using:
   (x₁ - x₂)² = (x₁ + x₂)² - 4x₁x₂ = 12² - 4*16 = 144 - 64 = 80
   ⇒ |x₁ - x₂| = √80 = 4√5

The ground truth answer is correct (4√5), while the proposed answer (8) is incorrect.
