The pattern suggests that the existence of such a function is equivalent to a combinatorial design or coloring argument similar to the Erdős–Rényi or Ramsey type problems for pairs within a finite set. The constraints imply a function avoiding certain repetitions (i ≠ j, and others). Since the maximum value is 10, and the domain set size is 252, the key is whether such an injective, non-repetitive coloring exists given these size constraints. Based on standard combinatorial bounds, the answer is TRUE when the number of colors (10) exceeds the maximum number of “conflicting” pairs—it's plausible the function exists.  
Final answer: <<<true>>>
