The final pattern suggests that the values of \(a\) for which \(2 \cdot r(n, a) - 1\) is a perfect square for all \(n \ge 1\) correspond to \(a\) such that the sequence maintains specific quadratic behavior. From the enumerated answers and the recursive pattern, the key integer values of \(a\) that satisfy this condition are \(a \in \{ 1, 2 \}\). Therefore, the closed set is \(\{ 1, 2 \}\).
