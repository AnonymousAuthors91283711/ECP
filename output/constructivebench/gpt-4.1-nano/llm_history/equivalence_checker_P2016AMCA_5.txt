Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | Even n ∧ n > 2 ∧ ∀ (p q : ℕ), p.Prime → q.Prime → p + q ≠ n}
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | 2 < n ∧ n % 2 = 0 ∧ ¬∃ p q : ℕ, p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ p + q = n}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Here's why:
1. "Even n" is equivalent to "n % 2 = 0"
2. "n > 2" is equivalent to "2 < n"
3. "¬∃ (p q : ℕ), p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ p + q = n" is equivalent to "∀ (p q : ℕ), p.Prime → q.Prime → p + q ≠ n" by De Morgan's laws
The order of conditions is different, but the logical meaning is identical.
