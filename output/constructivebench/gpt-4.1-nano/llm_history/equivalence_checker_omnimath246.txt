theorem omnimath246 (m n : ℕ) (h : m ≥ n) :
    (m + n)! / (m - n)! = omnimath246_answer m n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun m n => ∏ i in Finset.Icc 1 n, (m^2 + m - i^2 + i)
Proposed Answer: fun m n => Finset.prod (Finset.range (2 * n))
  (λ k => m - n + 1 + k)
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer: This computes the product from i=1 to n of (m² + m - i² + i)

2. Proposed Answer: This computes the product from k=0 to 2n-1 of (m - n + 1 + k)

Let's expand the proposed answer's product:
- The product runs from k=0 to 2n-1
- The term is (m - n + 1 + k)
- This is equivalent to (m - n + 1)(m - n + 2)...(m + n)
- Which equals (m + n)! / (m - n)! since it's the product of terms from (m-n+1) to (m+n)

Now let's expand the ground truth answer:
- The product runs from i=1 to n
- Each term is (m² + m - i² + i) = (m + i)(m - i + 1)
- So the product is (m+1)(m)(m+2)(m-1)...(m+n)(m-n+1)
- When rearranged, this becomes (m-n+1)(m-n+2)...(m)(m+1)...(m+n)
- Which is exactly the same as (m + n)! / (m - n)!

Both answers correctly represent (m + n)! / (m - n)! in different forms. The proposed answer shows it as a single product of consecutive terms, while the ground truth shows it as a product of quadratic terms that expand to the same result.
