Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 5
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℝ => (1/2) * (20 + logb 2 x)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
1. We have x > 0 and logb (√2) x = 20
2. We need to find logb 2 (√x)

Ground Truth Answer:
- Constant function 5, independent of x

Proposed Answer:
- (1/2) * (20 + logb 2 x), which depends on x

Evaluation:
1. Let's solve the problem step by step:
   - Given: log_(√2) x = 20
   - Change of base: ln x / ln (√2) = 20
   - ln (√2) = (1/2) ln 2 ⇒ ln x = 20 * (1/2) ln 2 = 10 ln 2
   - Therefore x = 2^10 = 1024

2. Now compute log_2 (√x):
   - √x = √(2^10) = 2^5
   - log_2 (2^5) = 5

3. The ground truth correctly gives 5, which is constant for all x satisfying the condition (though x is actually fixed at 1024).

4. The proposed answer gives a function of x, but we've shown x must be 1024, making the answer always 5. The proposed answer would evaluate to (1/2)*(20 + log_2 1024) = (1/2)*(20 + 10) = 15, which is incorrect.

Conclusion:
The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't account for the fact that x is determined by the condition.
