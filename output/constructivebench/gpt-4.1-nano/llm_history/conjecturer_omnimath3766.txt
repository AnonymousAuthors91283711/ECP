theorem omnimath3766 : 
  ∃! p : ℕ × ℕ, 
    0 < p.1 ∧ 0 < p.2 ∧ 
    (p.1 + p.2 - 1) * (p.1 + p.2) / 2 - p.1 + 1 = 2015 ∧ 
    p = omnimath3766_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
The pattern suggests the expression resembles the formula for the sum of first n natural numbers adjusted by p. Given the equation, p.1 + p.2 is roughly related to 65 (since (p.1 + p.2)(p.1 + p.2 - 1)/2 + 1 ≈ 2015), dividing around 2015 times involved terms.

Based on the pattern, the value p.1 is near 30, p.2 near 35, satisfying the given conditions.

Final answer in Lean:
<<<(30, 35)>>>
