Ground Truth Answer: 448
Proposed Answer: (11 * 13 * 14 - 11 * 13 - 11 * 14 - 13 * 14 + 11 + 13 + 14) * (2002 / (11 * 13 * 14)) + 11 + 13 + 14 + 6
Let me analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem defines a function `a(n)` that assigns different values based on divisibility by 11, 13, and 14, and asks for the sum of `a(n)` from 0 to 2001.

2. The ground truth answer is 448.

3. The proposed answer is a complex expression that appears to be using inclusion-exclusion principles to count numbers with specific divisibility properties.

Analysis:
- The first term calculates numbers divisible by all three (11,13,14) and multiplies by 6
- It then subtracts counts for pairs and adds back single divisors
- The second part adds some constants (11+13+14+6)

However, the proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth:
- Calculating the proposed expression: (2002*11*13*14 = 2002, so 2002/(11*13*14) = 1)
- Then (11*13*14 - 11*13 - 11*14 - 13*14 + 11 + 13 + 14)*1 = 1001
- Plus 11+13+14+6 = 44
- Total = 1001 + 44 = 1045 ≠ 448

The proposed answer is incorrect in both approach and final value.
