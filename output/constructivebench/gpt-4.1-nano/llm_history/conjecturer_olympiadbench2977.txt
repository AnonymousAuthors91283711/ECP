The pattern suggests the answer relates to perfect squares where the product of divisors equals a power of n. For divisors product \( n^{k} \) with \( k=4 \), the key is \( n = p^{3} \) with prime \( p \), since divisors product equals \( n^{\text{number of divisors}/2} \). The minimal such \( n > 1 \) is \( 8 = 2^{3} \).
