  (∑ k in Finset.Icc 1 2009, k * (floor (2009 / k) - floor (2008 / k)) = omnimath1423_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sum involves the difference between floor divisions, which simplifies to an indicator of whether k divides 2009 (since floor(2009/k) - floor(2008/k) = 1 iff k divides 2009, else 0). The sum then equals the sum over divisors of 2009 of k. Prime factorization: 2009 = 7^2 * 41; divisors are 1,7,41,49,287,2009. Summing these yields: 1 + 7 + 41 + 49 + 287 + 2009 = 2394. 

Answer:

<<<2294>>>
