Ground Truth Answer: 48
Proposed Answer: 40
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a scenario with distance (d), time (t), and speed (v) relationships:
   - d/40 = t + 3/60 (3 minutes converted to hours)
   - d/60 = t - 3/60
   - d/v = t

2. Solving the first two equations:
   - From d/40 = t + 0.05 and d/60 = t - 0.05
   - Subtract second from first: d/40 - d/60 = 0.1
   - (3d - 2d)/120 = 0.1 → d/120 = 0.1 → d = 12

3. Plugging d=12 into first equation: 12/40 = t + 0.05 → t = 0.3 - 0.05 = 0.25

4. Then from d/v = t → 12/v = 0.25 → v = 12/0.25 = 48

The ground truth answer is indeed 48, while the proposed answer is 40. These are clearly different values.
