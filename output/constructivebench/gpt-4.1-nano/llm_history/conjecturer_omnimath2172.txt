The pattern suggests the sum over binomial coefficients weighted by the absolute value of the Pascal triangle entries yields a symmetric result. Since Pascal triangle entries are non-negative, the absolute value doesn't affect the sum. The total sum simplifies to summing over those ratios, which telescope or sum to a known constant. Recognizing the properties of binomial expansions, the sum simplifies to 2^{2018}.

<<<2^(2018)>>>
