Ground Truth Answer: 1/2
Proposed Answer: (3 / 8 : ℚ)
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem is about finding the probability that a randomly selected positive divisor of 60 is less than 7.

2. First, we need to find all positive divisors of 60:
   - 60 = 2² × 3 × 5
   - Number of divisors = (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12
   - Divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60

3. Favorable divisors (n < 7): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 → 6 numbers

4. Probability = favorable/total = 6/12 = 1/2

The ground truth answer is 1/2, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 3/8, which is incorrect.
