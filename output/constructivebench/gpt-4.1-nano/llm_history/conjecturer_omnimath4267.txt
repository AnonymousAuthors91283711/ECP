abbrev omnimath4267_answer : Set (ℤ × ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath4267 :
  {p : ℤ × ℤ | 7 * p.1 + 14 * p.2 = 5 * p.1 ^ 2 + 5 * p.1 * p.2 + 5 * p.2 ^ 2} = omnimath4267_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ)
The equation simplifies to a quadratic form, leading to solutions where p.2 = p.1. This makes the relation hold for all p.1, p.2 with p.2 = p.1.  
Final answer:  
<<<{p : ℤ × ℤ | p.2 = p.1}>>>
