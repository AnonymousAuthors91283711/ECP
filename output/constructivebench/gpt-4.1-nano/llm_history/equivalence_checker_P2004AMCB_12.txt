Ground Truth Answer: fun n => if n % 6 = 0 then 0 else 2004 - (n % 6)
Proposed Answer: fun n => n + 2001
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem defines a recursive function f with initial values f(0)=2001, f(1)=2002, f(2)=2003, and a recurrence relation f(k+3) = f(k+1) + f(k) - f(k+2).

2. The ground truth answer shows a periodic pattern with period 6, where the output depends on n modulo 6.

3. The proposed answer is a simple linear function that doesn't match the recursive definition or the ground truth's periodic behavior.

4. Let's test some values:
   - For n=3: Ground truth gives 2004-3=2001, proposed gives 3+2001=2004 (mismatch)
   - For n=4: Ground truth gives 2004-4=2000, proposed gives 4+2001=2005 (mismatch)
   - For n=6: Ground truth gives 0, proposed gives 6+2001=2007 (mismatch)

The proposed answer doesn't match the recursive definition or the ground truth's behavior.
