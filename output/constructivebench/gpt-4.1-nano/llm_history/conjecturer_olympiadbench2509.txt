noncomputable abbrev olympiadbench2509_answer : ℝ × ℝ × ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2509 :
  { (a, b, c) : ℝ × ℝ × ℝ | a > 0 ∧ a ≠ 1 ∧
    Real.logb a (3 + b) + c = 5 ∧
    Real.logb a (5 + b) + c = 4 ∧
    Real.logb a (11 + b) + c = 3 } = {olympiadbench2509_answer} := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ × ℝ × ℝ
The provided equations imply a consistent pattern for the logs, suggesting substitution to express \( (a, b, c) \) explicitly. Solving yields \( a = 2 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = 2 \).
