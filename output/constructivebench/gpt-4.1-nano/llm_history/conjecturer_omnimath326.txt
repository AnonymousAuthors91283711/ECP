The given set involves submodules of matrices with the property that A*Aᵀ = Aᵀ*A, which holds when matrices commute with their transpose, implying symmetry or certain spectral properties. The maximal dimension for such submodules under these constraints matches the full space of symmetric matrices, which is of dimension (n(n + 1))/2. 

Thus, the function capturing this maximum dimension is (n(n + 1))/2.
