Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The key insight is that the sum a + b is uniquely determined by the given fractions. Since a ∈ [0,4], b ∈ [0,12], and the sum c is uniquely fixed due to the linear combination equaling 1/2015, the sum a + b can be expressed as an explicit constant. From the pattern, the sum turns out to be 4, as the only feasible combination satisfying all constraints reduces to this value.
