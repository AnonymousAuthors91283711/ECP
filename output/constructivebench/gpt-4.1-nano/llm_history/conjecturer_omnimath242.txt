The pattern indicates that the maximum size of T avoiding the specified congruence forms is the total number of pairs in a 1993×4 rectangle, minus those enforcing the forbidden conditions. Since the problem constrains T to a product of 1993×4, the largest k corresponds to all points in that grid, which is 1993×4 = 7972.
<<<1993 * 4>>>


This is a closed form in ℕ, matching the pattern and avoiding the forbidden configuration.
