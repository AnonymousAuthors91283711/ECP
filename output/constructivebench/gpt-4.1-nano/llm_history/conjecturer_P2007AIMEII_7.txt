The pattern suggests the answer involves cube roots and divisibility, relating to the set of n_i divisible by k, and m expressed as n_i / k. The maximum m appears when n_i is the largest multiple of k less than or equal to (k)^3 (since n_i's cube root is k), i.e., n_i = k^3, thus m = n_i / k = k^2. To maximize m, choose the largest possible k less than or equal to ∛70 (since n_i ∈ Fin 70). The integer part of ∛70 is 4. Therefore, the maximum m is 4^2 = 16. Since the answer is expressed directly, the final answer is:

<<<16>>>
