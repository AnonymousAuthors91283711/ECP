The subset L2 consists of products of pairs from L1 scaled by q; L3 includes sums/differences of squares from L1. Since all elements arise from L1 with fixed structure and |L1|=10, the key is when the quadratic form can cover the scaled products. The typical critical value ensuring inclusion is q=0, as zero in L2 can be achieved via a=b=0, making L2⊆L3 always true; otherwise, for q≠0, the coverage depends on the span. 

Final answer: <<<{x : ℝ | x = 0}>>>
