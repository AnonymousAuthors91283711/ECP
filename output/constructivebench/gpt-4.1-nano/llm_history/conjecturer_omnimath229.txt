The pattern suggests solutions where \(f(x) = 0\) or \(f(x) = -x\); substituting these respectively satisfies the functional equation. Generalizing, constant solutions \(f(x)=c\) lead to \(c=0\), and linear ones \(f(x) = -x\) satisfy the relation. The solution set is the union of these: functions identically zero or linear functions of the form \(-x\).

The current proposed answer is written as a lambda expression with a "text" comment embedded, which is invalid syntax in Lean. To fix the error, I will remove the comment syntax inside the expression and directly define the set as containing functions satisfying the described conditions. Since the conjectured solutions are functions constantly zero or linear functions like -x, the set can be expressed as the union of those two types: the singleton set of the zero function and the singleton set of the function x ↦ -x.

Furthermore, in Lean, the set of functions satisfying such properties is written as {f : ℝ → ℝ | ...}. The union of two singleton sets can be written as set.union {f | curl} {f | curl}.

So, the final corrected and generalized answer should be:

<<<{f : ℝ → ℝ | (∀ x : ℝ, f x = 0)} ∪ {f : ℝ → ℝ | (∀ x : ℝ, f x = -x)}>>>

This form clearly expresses the union of the two solution functions and aligns with the set comprehension syntax expected in Lean. It captures the constant zero solution and the linear solution, as suggested by the pattern analysis.
