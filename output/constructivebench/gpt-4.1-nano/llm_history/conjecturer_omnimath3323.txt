Given the product form, symmetry suggests pairing terms involving k and 350 - k, which simplify to factors involving k. The product reduces to a factorial expression involving 350, with an additional factor possibly coming from the middle term at k=175. A plausible closed form expression is 350! * 175, which accounts for the pairing and the middle element. 

<<<(350)! * 175>>>
