abbrev P2022AMCA_1_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2022AMCA_1 : 
  P2022AMCA_1_answer ∈ ({31/10, 49/15, 33/10, 109/33, 15/4} : Set ℚ) ∧
  (∀ q ∈ ({31/10, 49/15, 33/10, 15/4} : Set ℚ), q ≠ P2022AMCA_1_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The pattern suggests the answer is one of the set elements, excluding the known options based on the structure of the set. Based on the enumerated options, the element 109/33 (which simplifies to 33/10) is notably not listed as an answer, but 109/33 is given explicitly. Since the problem states the answer is from the set and not equal to the others, and considering the list's pattern, the likely choice is 109/33.

Final answer: 
<<<49/15>>>
