The pattern suggests the magnitudes of (a n, b n) grow exponentially, with the difference exceeding zero. The key recursive step involves √((a n)^2 + (b n)^2), which resembles a hyperbolic or exponential scaling. Given the initial conditions and the recurrence, the magnitudes grow approximately as powers of 2. At n = 2012, the dominant term should be scaled by 2 raised to the power of n, adjusted by the initial conditions.

Answer: <<<-2 * 2^(2012)>>>
