theorem P2000AIMEI_15 :
  ∃ (original : List ℕ),
    original.length = 2000 ∧
    original.Nodup ∧
    (∀ n, 1 ≤ n → n ≤ 2000 → n ∈ original) ∧
    process original [] = List.range' 1 2000 1 ∧
    let pos := original.indexOf 1999
    pos = 2000 - P2000AIMEI_15_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Because the process rearranges elements to sequentially place all numbers 1 to 2000, the key is recognizing the pattern: elements are interleaved such that 1999 ends at position 2000 - answer, which corresponds to the sequence's structure. The pattern suggests that the answer is (2000 - 1999) / 2 = 0.5, but since answer is ℕ, the consistent pattern gives: <<<1000>>>
