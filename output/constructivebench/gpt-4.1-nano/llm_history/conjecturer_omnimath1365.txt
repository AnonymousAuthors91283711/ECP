The pattern suggests the maximum occurs when p.1 and p.2 are as close as possible, maximizing their product under the conditions. For p.1 ≥ 1 and p.2 ≥ p.1, with p.2 ≤ 100, the maximum of (p.1 + p.2)(p.1 + p.2 + 1) / (p.1 * p.2). The maximum is achieved at p.1=1 and p.2=100, giving the maximal value. 

Final answer: <<< (1, 100) >>>
