theorem olympiadbench2426 :
  ∃! v, v > 0 ∧ 
  (let train_interval := 3/60;     let passing_interval := 10/60;     let linh_speed := 60;
      let relative_speed := v - linh_speed;
      let train_distance := v * train_interval;
      passing_interval = train_distance / relative_speed) ∧
  v = olympiadbench2426_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the formulas, solve for v:
passing_interval = train_distance / (v - linh_speed)
=> 10/60 = (v * 3/60) / (v - 60)
=> cross-multiplied: (10/60) * (v - 60) = v * 3/60
=> (v - 60)/6 = v/20
=> multiply through by 60: 10(v - 60) = 3v
=> 10v - 600 = 3v
=> 7v = 600
=> v = 600/7
Final answer: <<<600/7>>>.
