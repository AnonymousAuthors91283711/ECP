The pattern of constraints suggests a set of variables linked by linear equations and positivity conditions, resembling a system that sums pairs to a common total. Observing the symmetry and the total degrees of freedom, the solutions correspond to assigning positive integers satisfying the described relations, leading to the total count being 8. 

Thus, the card of the solution set is 8.
