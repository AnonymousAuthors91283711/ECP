The pattern suggests counting functions from a 12-element finite set to Bool with constraints on quadruples. The key is that the forbidden quadruples relate to pairwise sums being equal, indicating the structure of affine or linear functions. Since the problem emphasizes avoiding polyhedral configurations, the number of valid functions corresponds to the count of affine functions over GF(2), which are 2^n. For n = 12, the total is 2^12. Thus, the answer is 2^12.

<<<2^12>>>
