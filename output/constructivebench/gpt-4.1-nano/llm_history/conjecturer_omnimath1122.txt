  (choose 6 4) * (2/3)^5 * (1/3)^2 + (choose 6 4) * (1/3)^5 * (2/3)^2 = omnimath1122_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The expression involves symmetrical binomial terms and powers of 2/3 and 1/3. Recognizing the symmetry, the sum simplifies to twice one common term, which is the probability in a binomial distribution with parameters n=6, p=2/3. The combined expression reduces to 2 * C(6,4) * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^2.
