The problem describes selecting sets of pairs in a 6×6 grid with each element connected to exactly 3 others, and no loops of length 2 (since a ≠ b). Recognizing this as a 3-regular simple graph on 6 vertices, the total edges are (6 * 3) / 2 = 9. Each edge is unique, giving a total of 9 edges.

The total number of such sets equals the number of 3-regular simple graphs on 6 vertices, which is known to be 20.

Thus, the answer is 20.

<<<20>>>
