The problem requires finding the count of all n in [2, 2016] such that for all primes p < 8, p divides n^n - 1. The primes less than 8 are 2, 3, 5, 7. Since n^n ≡ 1 mod p for these primes, the likely candidate n must satisfy specific divisibility patterns reflecting these conditions. The only n satisfying n^n ≡ 1 mod p for all these primes are n divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 7 individually, i.e., divisible by their product 210, because of the Chinese Remainder Theorem constraints. Count the multiples of 210 in [2, 2016].

Number of multiples of 210 between 2 and 2016 = ⌊2016/210⌋ - ⌊(2-1)/210⌋ = 9 - 0 = 9. 

Final answer:
<<<9>>>
