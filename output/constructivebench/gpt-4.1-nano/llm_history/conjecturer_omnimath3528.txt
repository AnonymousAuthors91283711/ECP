theorem omnimath3528 (w l t : ℕ) :
  (w + l + t = 3 ∧ ∃ (g_for g_against : ℕ), g_for > g_against) ↔ 
  (w, l, t) ∉ omnimath3528_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)
Based on pattern and constraints, the set excludes triples where the sum w + l + t = 3 and there's a pair with a strict inequality g_for > g_against; it seems to include triples where the sum exceeds 3 or where g_for ≤ g_against. Thus, the set is all triples with sum ≠ 3. 

Answer: <<<{(w, l, t) | w + l + t ≠ 3}>>>
