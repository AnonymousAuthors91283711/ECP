theorem P2013AIMEI_5 :
  let (a, b, c) := P2013AIMEI_5_answer
  0 < a ∧ 0 < b ∧ 0 < c ∧
  (fun x => 8*x^3 - 3*x^2 - 3*x - 1) ((a^(1/3) + b^(1/3) + 1) / c) = 0 ∧
  a + b + c = 98 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ × ℕ
Given the polynomial condition and the sum constraint, the pattern suggests that a, b, c are positive integers related to perfect cubes and roots, and sum to 98. From the enumeration, the answer aligns with common factorizations and symmetry. The final solution likely involves cubic roots around integers summing to 98 with the polynomial condition satisfied.
