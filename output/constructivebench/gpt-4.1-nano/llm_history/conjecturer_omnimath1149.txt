Given the pattern, the answer is the maximal length n for the arithmetic progression with positive start and difference, all prime, and less than 1,000,000. The longest such sequence occurs when starting from 2 with difference 1, for n = 78500 approximately, but exact maximum is constrained by maximum prime less than 1,000,000. A typical maximum length is 78498 for the prime sequence from 2 onwards.
