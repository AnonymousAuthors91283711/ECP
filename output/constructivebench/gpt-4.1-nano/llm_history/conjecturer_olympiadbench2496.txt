The pattern suggests the sequence's prime valuations grow exponentially, with the minimum of the 2-adic and 5-adic valuations for n=14. Based on the recursive structure, the valuations align with Fibonacci numbers. The minimal valuation corresponds to △₁₄ = Fibonacci(14) = 377. Thus, the closed form is 377.
