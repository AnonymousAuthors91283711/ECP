  Nat.card {x : ℕ | ∃ (a b : ℕ), a * x = 48 ∧ b * x = 64} = P2010AMCB_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The set includes x dividing both 48 and 64, i.e., common divisors. The greatest common divisor of 48 and 64 is 16, so all divisors of 16 satisfy the condition. The number of such divisors is the count of divisors of 16, which is \(2^{\text{number of prime factors}}\). Since \(16 = 2^4\), it has \(4+1=5\) divisors: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.

Answer:
<<<5>>>
