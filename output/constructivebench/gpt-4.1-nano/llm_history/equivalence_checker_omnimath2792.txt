abbrev omnimath2792_answer : â„• := sorry
theorem omnimath2792 :
  2 ^ 3 + 2 ^ 2 + 2 ^ 1 = omnimath2792_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 14
Proposed Answer: 3 * 2 ^ 2 + 2^1
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer simplifies to 3 * 4 + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14, which matches the ground truth answer. Both expressions evaluate to the same value, so they are equivalent.
