abbrev P2004AMCA_1_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2004AMCA_1 : 
  ∃! (n : ℕ), n = floor (20 * 100 * (1.45 : ℝ)/100) ∧ n = P2004AMCA_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The answer is the exact value of the floor function: 29. Since the problem wants a unique natural number satisfying the given condition, the simplified closed form should be that specific value.

<<<29>>>
