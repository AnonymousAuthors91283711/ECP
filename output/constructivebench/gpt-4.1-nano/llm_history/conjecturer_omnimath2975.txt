theorem omnimath2975 :
  let ben_outcomes := [5, 10, 20]
  let jamie_outcomes := [30, 40]
  let total_outcomes := List.product ben_outcomes jamie_outcomes
  let favorable := total_outcomes.filter (fun (b, j) => b + j = 50)
  favorable.length * (1 : ℚ) / total_outcomes.length = omnimath2975_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The favorable outcomes are only (20, 30), the only pair summing to 50. Total outcomes are 3 * 2 = 6. Probability = 1/6.
