The pattern suggests the matrix's evolution over 10 steps relates to powers of transitions in a pentagon; after 10 steps, the (0,0) entry sums return probabilities around a regular pentagon. Therefore, the limit converges to the stationary probability, which is 1/5. The power transformations maintain uniformity, giving us:

<<<(1/5 : ℚ)>>>
