The pattern suggests functions satisfying a Cauchy-like functional equation with an affine property. Particularly, functions satisfying the given symmetry condition are affine linear functions with an additive component, i.e., f(x) = a * x + b where a, b ∈ ℚ. Since the condition is symmetric and invariant under affine transformations, the set should be all affine functions. 

Therefore, the set of functions: {f : ℚ → ℚ | ∃ a b ∈ ℚ, ∀ x, f x = a * x + b}.

<<<{f | ∃ a b : ℚ, ∀ x : ℚ, f x = a * x + b}>>>
