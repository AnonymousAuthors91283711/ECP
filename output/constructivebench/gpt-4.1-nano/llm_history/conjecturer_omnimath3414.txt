The problem is to find a natural number that satisfies the negation of the given existential property: no k exists such that 23 - answer = 3 * k and answer < 23.  
Following the pattern in the enumeration, the answer should be the value that cannot satisfy these conditions simultaneously.  
Thus, the most plausible concrete answer that makes the negation true is 23 itself, since for any k, 23 - 23 = 0, which is 3 * 0, and 23 < 23 is false, so the existential claim doesn't hold.

Given the problem, we're asked to find a natural number `omnimath3414_answer` such that the statement `¬ ∃ k : ℕ, (23 - answer) = 3 * k ∧ answer < 23` holds true. Equivalently, for this answer, there is no `k` satisfying `23 - answer = 3 * k` with `answer < 23`.

Analyzing the condition:  
- If `answer = 23`, then `23 - 23 = 0`, which is equal to `3 * 0`, so for `k=0`, the existence condition holds. But since the claim involves negation, our answer should be such that this doesn't happen when `answer < 23`, ensuring the negation is true.

- When `answer < 23`, the cases for `23 - answer` are positive integers less than 23.  
- The key is to find an `answer` such that for all `k`, either `23 - answer ≠ 3 * k` or `answer ≥ 23`. But since the negation states that the existential statement doesn't hold, the only candidate answer that trivially satisfies the negation is `answer = 23`, because `23 - 23 = 0`, which matches `3 * 0`, but then `answer < 23` is false, so the existential statement is false, and negation is true.

Therefore, the simplest choice is to pick `answer = 23` that makes the negation true.

**Final corrected Lean expression:**

<<<23>>>

**Explanation:**
- The answer is 23 because for `answer=23`, the condition `(23 - answer) = 3 * k` holds for `k=0`, but `answer < 23` is false, so the existential statement is false, satisfying `¬ ∃ ...`.  
- This aligns with the enumeration pattern and simplifies the negation for the given condition.
