: (2 ^ 2001 % (2 ^ 7 - 1) = omnimath388_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern in the enumerated answers suggests the answer is related to powers of 2 modulo \(2^7 - 1 = 127\). Recognizing that \(2^{7} \equiv 1 \pmod{127}\), and \(2001 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\), we conclude \(2^{2001} \equiv 2^{1} \equiv 2 \pmod{127}\).
