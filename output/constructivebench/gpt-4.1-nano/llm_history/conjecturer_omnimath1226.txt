theorem omnimath1226 : 
  let total_outcomes : ℚ := 4^8
  let successful_outcomes : ℚ := 1225
  successful_outcomes / total_outcomes = omnimath1226_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The problem suggests a combinatorial probability, with total outcomes as 4^8 and successful outcomes as 1225. The pattern hints at a specific ratio involving these numbers, likely simplified to a rational form. Given the enumeration, the ratio simplifies to (35/256), as 1225/65536 reduces to 35/256.
