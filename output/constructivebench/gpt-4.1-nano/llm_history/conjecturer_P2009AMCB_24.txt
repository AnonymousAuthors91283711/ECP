The condition simplifies because arcsin(sin(6x)) and arccos(cos x) equality implies x is near the points where these functions coincide, considering their periodicity and principal value ranges. The pattern from the enumeration indicates solutions occur at specific multiples of π/12 within [0, π], totaling 11 points. Hence, the answer is the count of such points.
