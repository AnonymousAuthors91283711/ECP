The set involves sums of square roots, with the domain constrained to x in [-1, 1], suggesting the infimum occurs at boundary points for possible minimal values of the square root expressions.

Based on the enumerated answers and the structure, the minimal value is achieved when both square roots are minimized: √(58 - 42x) with x = 1 or x = -1, and similarly for the second term, considering the range of √(1 - x²).

At x = 1, √(58 - 42*1) = √(16) = 4, and √(149 - 140*√(0)) = √149 ≈ 12.206. Summing yields approx 16.206.

At x = -1, √(58 - 42*(-1)) = √(58 + 42) = √100 = 10, and √(149 - 140*√(0)) ≈ √149 ≈ 12.206, sum ≈ 22.206.

Between these, the minimal sum is at x=1: 4 + √149.

Final answer: 

<<<real.sqrt(58 - 42 * 1) + real.sqrt(149)>>>

which simplifies to:

<<<4 + real.sqrt(149)>>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The primary error in your proposed Lean answer is the use of `real.sqrt`, which is not a recognized identifier in Mathlib; the standard way to refer to the square root function in Lean's `Real` namespace is `Real.sqrt`. Additionally, `Real.sqrt` expects a real argument, but the expression uses 149 directly, which should be fine, but consistency suggests ensuring all constants and functions are properly qualified. 

Furthermore, the current approach to choosing `x = 1` is arbitrary; since the question involves a infimum over an interval and functions involving square roots, the minimal value likely occurs at the boundary `x = 1` or `x = -1`. Given the structure, the minimal value for the set of the sum involves evaluating at critical points, which in this case simplifies to the endpoints due to the monotonic nature of the functions involved.

Since the answer is a real number, the absolute simplest candidate considering the provided structure is the value of the expression at the boundary point `x = 1`. The expression then becomes `Real.sqrt(58 - 42 * 1) + Real.sqrt(149 - 140 * Real.sqrt(1 - 1^2))`, which simplifies to `Real.sqrt(16) + Real.sqrt(149 - 140 * 1) = 4 + Real.sqrt(9) = 4 + 3 = 7`.

Thus, the correct expression should be `7`.

Final Answer in Lean:
<<<7>>>

This provides the minimal value of the expression over the interval, matching the pattern suggested by enumerations and the problem's structure.
