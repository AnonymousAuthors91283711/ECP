Ground Truth Answer: 20
Proposed Answer: 11
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a system of equations with variables a, b, x, y and asks for the value of a*x⁵ + b*y⁵ given the values for lower exponents.

2. This is a classic problem that can be solved using recurrence relations or Newton's identities. The sequence formed by S_n = a*x^n + b*y^n satisfies a linear recurrence relation.

3. For such problems, the correct approach would be to find the recurrence relation from the given terms and then compute the next term.

4. The ground truth answer is 20, which is a known correct solution to this particular system of equations (this is a well-known problem in competition mathematics).

5. The proposed answer is 11, which doesn't match the known correct solution.

Since the proposed answer (11) differs from the correct answer (20), they are not equivalent.
