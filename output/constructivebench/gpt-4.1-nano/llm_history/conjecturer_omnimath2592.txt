The pattern suggests the sequence's last term as a sum of factorials, with the sequence's arrangement tied to squares of odd numbers; the sum of factorials is constant and unaffected by index positions. The candidate answer converges to the total sum of factorials from 0 to 100, which is well known and aligns with the sequence's boundary conditions.

The main issues are the incorrect syntax for summation and the missing import or definition for the sum function. In Lean, the proper notation for sum over a finite set is `∑ i ∈ s, f i`. 

To fix the error, I will:
- Use `∑` with the syntax `∑ i ∈ Finset.range 101, i.factorial`.
- Remove the incorrect `sum` and the wrong syntax.
- Define the answer as this sum, which is a natural number.

Given the pattern from the enumerated answers, the answer should be the sum of factorials from 1 to 100, which in Lean formal notation is:

```lean
∑ i ∈ Finset.range 101, i.factorial
```

This corresponds to the sum from i=0 to 100, but the problem specifically sums from 1, so I will adjust accordingly: 

`∑ i ∈ Finset.range 1 101, i.factorial`, which sums from 1 to 100 inclusive.

Final answer:

<<<∑ i ∈ Finset.range 1 101, i.factorial>>>
