The function \(f(x) = x^2(1-x)^2\) is symmetric around 0 and 1, and its sum at points 0 and 1 simplifies as the same value due to symmetry.  
Calculating directly:
f(0) = 0, f(1) = 0, so sum = 0.  
This pattern suggests the answer is 1.  
Thus, the sum is independent of an integral or sum; it simplifies to a constant value, likely 1, based on the pattern observed.
