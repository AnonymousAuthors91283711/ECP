The equation \(2 + \sqrt{x-2} = x-2\) implies \(\sqrt{x-2} = x-4\). Since \(\sqrt{x-2} \ge 0\), we consider \(x-4 \ge 0 \rightarrow x \ge 4\). The quadratic then simplifies to \(x-4 = \sqrt{x-2}\), leading to \(x-4 = \pm \sqrt{x-2}\). Only the positive root satisfies \(x \ge 4\), giving \(x-4 = \sqrt{x-2}\). Substituting \(t = \sqrt{x-2}\), then \(x = t^2 + 2\), and the equation becomes \(t^2 + 2 - 4 = t\), or \(t^2 - t - 2 = 0\). Solving: \(t = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm 3}{2}\), with valid solution \(t=2\). \(x = t^2 + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6\). Therefore, the solution set is \(\{6\}\).
