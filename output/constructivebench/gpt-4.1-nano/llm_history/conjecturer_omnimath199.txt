Based on the pattern, the inequality holds for all integers n where the sum of the positive exponents preserves the inequality, likely including n ≥ 1, and possibly negative values depending on symmetry. Considering the symmetry and the equality conditions, the set should be all integers n such that the inequality holds universally. Since the sum is symmetric and non-negative, for negative n the terms are reciprocals, but the inequality may still hold for all integers n ≥ 1 unless exceptions arise. So, the answer set is all integers n ≥ 1.
