Ground Truth Answer: 85
Proposed Answer: (nat.to_int $ (N/5) * 2 * (∑ i in Finset.range (2*(N/5)+1), Nat.choose N i))
Let me analyze this carefully.

1. The problem is asking for the smallest positive multiple of 5 (N) where P(N) < 321/400, with the additional constraint that the sum of its digits is 12.

2. The ground truth answer is 85, which:
   - Is a multiple of 5 (85 % 5 = 0)
   - Has digit sum 8+5=13 (Wait, this contradicts the problem statement which says sum should be 12)
   - Wait, this suggests there might be an error in either the problem statement or ground truth answer

3. The proposed answer is a complex expression involving N/5 and a sum of binomial coefficients, but:
   - It's not a concrete number like the ground truth answer
   - It's expressed in terms of N rather than being a solution
   - The format is completely different from what the problem asks for

Given that:
- The ground truth answer doesn't satisfy the digit sum condition (should be 12 but 8+5=13)
- The proposed answer isn't even in the right form (should be a number, not an expression)
- They're fundamentally different in nature
