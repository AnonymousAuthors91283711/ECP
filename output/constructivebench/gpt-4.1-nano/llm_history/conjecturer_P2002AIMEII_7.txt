  IsLeast {k : ℕ | 0 < k ∧ (∑ i in Finset.range (k + 1), i^2) % 200 = 0} P2002AIMEII_7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests that the smallest k with sum of squares divisible by 200 is near 13, since 13^2=169, and sum calculations stabilize around this value. The minimal such k appears to be 13. Therefore, the answer can be expressed as:

<<<13>>>
