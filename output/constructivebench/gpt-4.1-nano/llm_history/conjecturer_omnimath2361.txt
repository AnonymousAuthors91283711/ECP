Given that d divides 12! and d > 0 with d % 3 = 1, d is coprime with 3 and divides 12!. Largest such d takes into account prime factors of 12! excluding 3. The maximum product includes all prime powers except 3 and its powers, so the answer is the product of all prime powers dividing 12! without 3.
