The pattern suggests the set of functions satisfying the given inequality resembles quadratic functions, particularly affine functions, which make the inequality equality or hold universally. The inequality resembles a property associated with convexity or concavity, narrowing down to affine functions in ℝ→ℝ. 

In Lean, the set can be expressed as the set of all affine functions: f(x) = a * x + b.
