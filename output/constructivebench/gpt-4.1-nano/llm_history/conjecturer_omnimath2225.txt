Given the equations \( x^{y^{1/2}} = 27 \) and \( (x^{1/2})^y = 9 \), with \( x, y > 0 \), we interpret that:

- \( 27 = 3^3 \),
- \( 9 = 3^2 \).

From the first equation, taking natural logarithms:

\[ y^{1/2} \ln x = \ln 27 = 3 \ln 3. \]

From the second:

\[ y \ln x^{1/2} = y \frac{1}{2} \ln x = \ln 9 = 2 \ln 3. \]

Thus:

\[ \frac{1}{2} y \ln x = 2 \ln 3 \Rightarrow y \ln x = 4 \ln 3. \]

Now, the first:

\[ \sqrt{y} \ln x = 3 \ln 3. \]

Let \( t = \ln x \). Then:

\[ \sqrt{y} \, t = 3 \ln 3, \]
\[ y t = 4 \ln 3. \]

From the first:

\[ \sqrt{y} t = 3 \ln 3 \Rightarrow t = \frac{3 \ln 3}{\sqrt{y}}. \]

Substitute into second:

\[ y t = 4 \ln 3 \Rightarrow y \times \frac{3 \ln 3}{\sqrt{y}} = 4 \ln 3. \]

Simplify:

\[ \frac{3 y \ln 3}{\sqrt{y}} = 4 \ln 3. \]

Divide both sides by \(\ln 3\):

\[ \frac{3 y}{\sqrt{y}} = 4. \]

Note that:

\[ y / \sqrt{y} = \sqrt{y}. \]

Therefore:

\[ 3 \sqrt{y} = 4 \Rightarrow \sqrt{y} = \frac{4}{3} \Rightarrow y = \left( \frac{4}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{16}{9}. \]

Now,

\[ t = \frac{3 \ln 3}{\sqrt{y}} = 3 \ln 3 \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{4} \ln 3. \]

Thus,

\[ x = e^t = e^{\frac{9}{4} \ln 3} = 3^{\frac{9}{4}}. \]

Calculating \( x y \):

\[ x y = 3^{\frac{9}{4}} \times \frac{16}{9} = \frac{16}{9} \times 3^{\frac{9}{4}}. \]

Expressed as:

\[ x y = \frac{16}{9} \times 3^{2 + \frac{1}{4}} = \frac{16}{9} \times 3^2 \times 3^{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{16}{9} \times 9 \times 3^{\frac{1}{4}} = 16 \times 3^{\frac{1}{4}}. \]

Thus, the closed-form:

\[ \boxed{16 \times 3^{1/4}}. \]

In Lean syntax:

<<<fun _ => 16 * (3 : ℝ)^(1/4)>>>

The main issue with the proposed answer `fun _ => 16 * (3 : ℝ)^(1/4)` is that it is a function from some arbitrary input to a real number, rather than a concrete real number itself. The theorem states `x * y = ...`, i.e., the product `x * y` is equal to some real number. Therefore, the answer should be a specific real number, not a function.

Given the problem conditions:
- \( x^{\sqrt{y}}=27 \),
- \( (\sqrt{x})^{y}=9 \),
and the positivity constraints, we can use algebraic manipulations:
- From \( (\sqrt{x})^{y} = 9 \), rewrite as \( x^{y/2} = 9 \),
- From \( x^{\sqrt{y}} = 27 \),
and relate these two to find \(x, y\).

Since \( x^{\sqrt{y}}=27 \), write \( x = 27^{1/\sqrt{y}} \). Also, from \( x^{y/2} = 9 \), substitute \( x = 27^{1/\sqrt{y}} \):

\[
(27^{1/\sqrt{y}})^{y/2} = 9
\Rightarrow 27^{(y/2)/\sqrt{y}} = 9
\Rightarrow 27^{\sqrt{y}/2} = 9
\]

Express both sides with base 3:

\[
(3^3)^{\sqrt{y}/2} = 3^2 \Rightarrow 3^{3 \sqrt{y}/2} = 3^{2}
\Rightarrow 3 \sqrt{y} / 2 = 2
\Rightarrow \sqrt{y} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Square both sides:

\[
y = \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{16}{9}
\]

Now, substitute \( y \) back into \( x = 27^{1/\sqrt{y}} \). Since \(\sqrt{y} = 4/3\),

\[
x = 27^{1 / (4/3)} = 27^{3/4}
\]

Express 27 as \( 3^3 \):

\[
x= (3^3)^{3/4} = 3^{9/4}
\]

Finally, compute \( x \times y \):

\[
x y = 3^{9/4} \times \frac{16}{9} = \frac{16}{9} \times 3^{9/4}
\]

Express \( 3^{9/4} \) as \( 3^{2 + 1/4} = 3^{2} \times 3^{1/4} = 9 \times 3^{1/4} \):

\[
x y = \frac{16}{9} \times 9 \times 3^{1/4} = 16 \times 3^{1/4}
\]

Thus, the product \( x y \) equals \( 16 \times 3^{1/4} \).

In Lean, this is a concrete real number: `16 * 3 ^ (1/4)`.

<<<16 * (3 : ℝ) ^ (1/4)>>>
