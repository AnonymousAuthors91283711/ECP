The condition expresses that for each subset S, there exists a max element k dividing the product of the other elements. The minimal such m occurs when S is a singleton containing a minimal positive integer satisfying the divisor property, namely 1. Since 1 divides any product, the smallest such set has size 1, and the minimal element is 1. Therefore, the least m is 1.
