  P2010AMCA_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the enumeration pattern, the minimal total discrepancy occurs at n=0, when opponent sums are maximized and Chelsea sums minimized. The minimal total satisfies the inequality ∀ chelsea_remaining, opponent_remaining, Chelsea total > Opponent total at n=0. 

The final answer, thus, is the minimal n satisfying this, which is 0.
