The pattern suggests the maximum exponent \( n \) where \( 2^n \) divides some specified \( N \) related to sequences with squares summing to 4 and bounded terms. The divisibility condition, with constraints leading to powers of 2, indicates the answer is likely the highest power of 2 achievable in such sequences, which is 10.
