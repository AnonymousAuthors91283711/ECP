The problem asks for the cardinality of integer points within a circle of radius 2009. This count resembles summing the number of integer solutions to x² + y² ≤ r², which equals 4 times the number of positive solutions minus overlaps. 
The explicit count is approximately 4∑_{x=0}^{2009} ⌊√(2009² - x²)⌋ + 1. 
Based on symmetry, the main contribution is about 4×(2009+1)²/2, simplifying to roughly 4×2009²/2 + 4×2009 + 1. 
Thus, the total count is approximately 4×2009² + 4×2009 + 1.
The general closed form formula is: 4×2009×(2009 + 1) + 1.
<<<4 * 2009 * (2009 + 1) + 1>>>
