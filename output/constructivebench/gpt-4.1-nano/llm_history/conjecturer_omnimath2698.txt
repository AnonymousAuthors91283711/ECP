abbrev omnimath2698_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath2698 : (20 + 16 * 20) / (20 * 16) = omnimath2698_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Given the expression (20 + 16 * 20) / (20 * 16), simplifying yields (20 + 320) / 320 = 340 / 320 = 17/16. The pattern suggests a simple fraction involving these constants. Therefore: <<< (17/16 : ℚ) >>>
