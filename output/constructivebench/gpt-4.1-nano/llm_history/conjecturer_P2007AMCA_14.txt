The given product of five factors equals 45, and all are distinct integers derived from the set {6 - a, 6 - b, 6 - c, 6 - d, 6 - e}. Since 45 factors into primes as 3^2 * 5, possible integers among the factors are divisors of 45. By analyzing arrangements with distinct integers, the sum of a + b + c + d + e as linear transformations results in a fixed value. Based on enumeration, the sum simplifies to 15.
