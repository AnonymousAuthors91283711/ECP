The region described is a unit square with a quarter circle removed, resulting in the area of a quarter of the unit circle minus the square's corner. The area of the quarter circle is (π/4), and the square's area in that section is 1. The remaining area is (π/4) - (1/4). Generalizing, the answer is (π/4 - 1/4). 

<<<(π - 1) / 4>>>
