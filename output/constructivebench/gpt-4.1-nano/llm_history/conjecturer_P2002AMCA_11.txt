theorem P2002AMCA_11 (v : ℝ) :
  0 < v ∧
  (∃ (d t : ℝ), 0 < d ∧ 0 < t ∧
    d / 40 = t + 3/60 ∧
    d / 60 = t - 3/60 ∧
    d / v = t) ↔ v = P2002AMCA_11_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The given equations imply d/40 = t + 1/20 and d/60 = t - 1/20, so subtracting yields d/40 - d/60 = 1/10 which simplifies to d/120 = 1/10, hence d = 12 and t = d/40 - 1/20 = 0.3. Since d/v = t, v = d / t = 12 / 0.3 = 40. Final v is 40.

<<<40>>>
