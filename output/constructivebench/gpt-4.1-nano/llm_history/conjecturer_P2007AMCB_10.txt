theorem P2007AMCB_10 : 
  ∃ (total : ℕ), 
    0 < total ∧ 
    2 * total % 5 = 0 ∧      (2 * total / 5 - 2) * 10 = 3 * (total - 2 + 2) ∧      2 * total / 5 = P2007AMCB_10_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the equations, we solve for total: 2*total divisible by 5, so total is multiple of 5/2 (rational), but total must be integer, so total divisible by 5. Substitute total=5k; then the second equalities simplify to find k=3, so total=15. 

Final answer:
<<<15>>>
