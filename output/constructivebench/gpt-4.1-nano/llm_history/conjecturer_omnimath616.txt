Given the equations, subtract to eliminate \(x\), resulting in \(2008 - 2007 = y(\sin y + 2008 \cos y)\). Recognizing the expression resembles the derivative of \(-2008 \sin y + \cos y\), which equals zero at the solution point. The value of \(y\) satisfying these bounds is zero, leading to \(x = 2008\) and \(y=0\). Thus, \(x + y = 2008\).

<<<2008>>>
