The integral sums squares of ceiling values over intervals; the critical insight is the ceiling function's behavior with respect to integral limits and the resulting sum of squares. Given the result is proportional to 20√7, corresponding to specific multiples of 4 and partial sums, the pattern suggests the answer involves 24 as a key value reflecting ceiling pairs over the interval [0,w].
