The set A includes points in the square I×I where p₁ and p₂ are either both positive or both negative. Since p₁ * p₂ > 0, the relevant regions are the positive quadrant [0,10]×[0,10] minus the intersection with negative parts. The ratio simplifies to the total positive area over entire square, which is (10×10)/(30×30) = 100/900 = 1/9.
