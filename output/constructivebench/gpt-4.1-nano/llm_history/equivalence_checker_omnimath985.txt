theorem omnimath985 :
  {n : ℤ | (n ^ 2 - 4) ≠ 0 ∧ ((n ^ 3 + 8) % (n ^ 2 - 4) = 0)} = omnimath985_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6}
Proposed Answer: { n : ℤ | n ≠ 2 ∧ n ≠ -2 }
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem asks for all integers n where:
   - n² - 4 ≠ 0 (so n ≠ 2 and n ≠ -2)
   - n³ + 8 is divisible by n² - 4

2. The ground truth gives specific solutions: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6}

3. The proposed answer claims the solution is all integers except 2 and -2

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It includes all integers except ±2, but most of these don't satisfy the second condition (divisibility)
- For example, n=5 is in the proposed set but 5³+8=133 and 5²-4=21, and 133 is not divisible by 21
- Only the specific numbers in the ground truth satisfy both conditions

<<<False>>>
