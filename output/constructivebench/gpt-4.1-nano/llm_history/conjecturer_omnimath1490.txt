This problem involves finding the greatest prime p dividing the sum of a set of primes s, where the average of s is 27, and p is in s. The average being 27 implies the total sum is 27 times the size of s. To maximize p, we choose s with the largest prime as p and minimize other primes (preferably 2) to keep the sum divisible and p as large as possible while satisfying all conditions.

The set s with largest p and remaining primes at 2 minimizes the size while maintaining the average 27: sum = p + (k-1)*2, with total sum = 27k, so p + 2(k-1) = 27k → p = 27k - 2(k-1) = 27k - 2k + 2 = 25k + 2. To maximize p, pick k as small as possible, which is 1, but then s has one prime p=27 (not prime). Next k=2: p= 25*2 + 2=52, not prime.

Try larger k: for p to be prime, 25k + 2 must be prime. For k such that 25k + 2 is prime, the largest possible p is obtained at the smallest such k ≥ 1 where 25k + 2 is prime, actually for larger k, p increases but must be prime.

From the enumeration pattern, the maximum prime p with such structure occurs when p=53 (for k=2: 25*2+2=52, no; for k=3: 25*3+2=77, no), but with k=1: p=27, not prime.

Testing small values, prime p=53 occurs at k=2: 25*2+2=52, no; next prime candidate occurs when p=29 (since 29 is prime). p=29 corresponds to k=(29-2)/25=1.08, not integer, so no.

The largest prime p satisfying these constraints turns out to be 31 (which is prime). For that, set s of size 2: sum=54, mean=27: sum=27*2=54, p=31, the other prime is 23 (which is prime). Sum is 54=31+23, mean=27.

Thus, the greatest prime p with these conditions is p=31.

Explanation: Selecting the set s = {23, 31} yields sum=54, mean=27, with p=31 in s, and p is prime and greatest possible under these constraints.

The answer is **31**. Enclosed in Lean syntax:
