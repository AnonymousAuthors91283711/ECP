    IsGreatest {v | ∃ x y z : ℝ, P (x, y, z) ∧ v = x + y ^ 2 + z ^ 3} omnimath2326_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the constraints: x, y, z ≥ 0, x + y + z = 1, the maximum of v = x + y^2 + z^3 occurs when y and z are maximized (since y^2 and z^3 grow faster). y and z constrained by their sum with x. The maximum is at y = 1, z = 0, x = 0: v = 0 + 1^2 + 0 = 1.
