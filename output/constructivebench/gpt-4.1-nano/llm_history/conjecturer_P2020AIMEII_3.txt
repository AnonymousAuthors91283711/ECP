  m + n = (P2020AIMEII_3_answer.fst + P2020AIMEII_3_answer.snd) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
The equation involves ratios of logs with exponents of powers of 2 and 3, suggesting symmetry when ratios of logs are equal. Given the pattern, the unique solution corresponds to setting the ratio m/n so the logs match. The sum m + n from the enumerated pattern aligns with a ratio involving powers of 2 and 3. The minimal positive coprime pair fitting this pattern is (3, 1).
