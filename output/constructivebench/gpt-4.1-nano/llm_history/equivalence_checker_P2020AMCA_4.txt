Ground Truth Answer: 100
Proposed Answer: 4 * 5 * 5 * 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

Problem Breakdown:
1. We're looking for 4-digit numbers (1000-9999)
2. All digits must be even (0,2,4,6,8)
3. The number must be divisible by 5

Analysis:
- For a 4-digit number, first digit (thousands place) can be 2,4,6,8 (4 options, can't be 0)
- Second and third digits can be 0,2,4,6,8 (5 options each)
- Last digit must be 0 (since divisible by 5 and even, only 0 works - 5 would be odd)
- Total combinations: 4 (first) * 5 (second) * 5 (third) * 1 (last) = 100

The proposed answer is exactly this calculation (4*5*5*1=100) which matches the ground truth answer of 100. The reasoning behind the proposed answer is correct and leads to the exact same numerical result.
