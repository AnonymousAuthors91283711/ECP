Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: 80
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a sequence where:
   - a1, a2, a3 form an arithmetic sequence with common difference d
   - g1, g2, g3 are defined in terms of these a's
   - g2² = g1 * g3 (geometric sequence condition)
   - We need to find the minimal possible value of g3

2. Setting up the equations:
   - a1 = 9
   - a2 = 9 + d
   - a3 = 9 + 2d
   - g1 = 9
   - g2 = 9 + d + 2 = 11 + d
   - g3 = 9 + 2d + 20 = 29 + 2d

3. The geometric condition gives:
   (11 + d)² = 9*(29 + 2d)
   => d² + 22d + 121 = 261 + 18d
   => d² + 4d - 140 = 0

4. Solving the quadratic equation:
   d = [-4 ± √(16 + 560)]/2 = [-4 ± √576]/2 = [-4 ± 24]/2
   So d = 10 or d = -14

5. Calculating g3 for both cases:
   - For d = 10: g3 = 29 + 2*10 = 49
   - For d = -14: g3 = 29 + 2*(-14) = 1

6. The minimal value is clearly 1.

The ground truth answer (1) is correct, while the proposed answer (80) is incorrect.
