Ground Truth Answer: 154
Proposed Answer: 80
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n such that:
   - There exist natural numbers k, m satisfying:
     - 5m = 12k
     - 11(m + 50) = 25(k + 50)
   - And n = k + 50

2. Let's solve the equations:
   From 5m = 12k, we get m = (12/5)k
   Substituting into the second equation:
   11((12/5)k + 50) = 25(k + 50)
   Solving this gives k = 104
   Therefore n = k + 50 = 154

3. The ground truth answer is 154, which matches our calculation.
   The proposed answer is 80, which would correspond to k = 30, but:
   - If k = 30, then m = (12/5)*30 = 72
   - Checking the second equation: 11(72 + 50) = 1342 ≠ 25(30 + 50) = 2000
   - So 80 doesn't satisfy the conditions
