theorem P2023AIMEII_1 :
  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | ∃ (a d : ℕ),
    let seq := fun k => a + k * d
    seq 5 = 2 * seq 0 ∧
    (Finset.range 6).sum (fun k => seq k) = 990 ∧
    n = seq 5}
  P2023AIMEII_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sequence condition and sum imply an arithmetic sequence with sum over 6 terms = 990. Using sum formula, solve for a and d, then find n = a + 5d. The maximum n is achieved when d > 0 and matches the sequence parameters, giving n = 2 * a + 25d. Corresponding to the enumerated answers, the maximum n occurs when a=1, d=1, resulting in n = 27.
