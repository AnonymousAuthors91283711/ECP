Ground Truth Answer: 233
Proposed Answer: ( ( (3 +.sqrt 5)^7 - (3 - sqrt 5)^7 ) / (2^7 * sqrt 5) )
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is about finding the 7th term in a recurrence relation sequence where:
   - u₃ = 5
   - u₆ = 89
   - The recurrence is uₙ₊₂ = 3uₙ₊₁ - uₙ

2. The ground truth answer is 233, which is indeed the correct 7th term (u₇) of this sequence.

3. The proposed answer gives a closed-form solution involving powers of (3±√5). This appears to be a solution derived from solving the characteristic equation of the recurrence relation.

4. However, if we compute the proposed expression numerically:
   - (3+√5)^7 ≈ 393050.634
   - (3-√5)^7 ≈ 0.36586
   - The numerator ≈ 393050.634 - 0.36586 ≈ 393050.268
   - Denominator = 128 * √5 ≈ 286.2167
   - Result ≈ 393050.268/286.2167 ≈ 1373.28 ≠ 233

5. The proposed answer is incorrect because:
   - It's missing a factor of 1/2 in the exponents (should be ((3+√5)/2)^7 etc.)
   - The denominator should be √5 alone (without the 2^7)
   - The correct closed form would be ((φ²)^7 - (ψ²)^7)/√5 where φ = (1+√5)/2, ψ = (1-√5)/2
