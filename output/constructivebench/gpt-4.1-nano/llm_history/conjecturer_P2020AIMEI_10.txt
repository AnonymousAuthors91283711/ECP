The problem asks for the smallest \(k\) such that there exists \(m,n\) with the specified properties, notably \(m + n = k\), \(n^n \mid m^m\), and \(\gcd(m + n, 210) = 1\). From the enumeration, the minimal such sum arises when \(m=2, n=1\), giving \(k=3\), with \(\gcd(3, 210)=1\), \(1^1 \mid 2^2\), satisfying all conditions. 

Thus, the concise formula for this minimal \(k\) is \(m + n = 2 + 1 = 3\).
