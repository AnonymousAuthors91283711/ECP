The problem involves primes \( p \) satisfying \( p \mid (k^3 - 1) \) for some integer \( k \). Factoring the cubic: \( k^3 - 1 = (k - 1)(k^2 + k + 1) \). For \( p \) prime dividing \( k^3 - 1 \), either \( p \) divides \( k - 1 \) or \( p \) divides \( k^2 + k + 1 \). Given \( p^2 - p + 1 = k^3 \), rewriting yields conditions on \( p \) and \( k \). The pattern suggests only \( p = 2 \) and \( p = 3 \)--the only small primes satisfying the constraints, because larger primes cannot satisfy the divisibility conditions easily. Therefore, the set coincides with these primes.
