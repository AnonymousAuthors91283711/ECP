theorem P2011AMCA_2 (order : List String) :
  order = ["C", "E", "D", "A", "B"] â†” order = P2011AMCA_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: List String
Given the enumeration pattern, the unique sequence appears as a specific fixed ordering. The answer likely corresponds to the list ["C", "E", "D", "A", "B"] itself, serving as the canonical solution. 

Based on the enumerations, the concise fixed order is:

<<<["C", "E", "D", "A", "B"]>>>
