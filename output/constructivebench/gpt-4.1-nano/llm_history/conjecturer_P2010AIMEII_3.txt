The pattern suggests looking at powers of 2 dividing certain products, with prime factors related to sequence bounds; therefore, the answer is the maximum n with 2^n dividing the combined product. This max n occurs at the largest possible product, i.e., when b - a is maximized (from 19 down to 1), and considering the sum over a, the dominant term is when a=1, b=20, giving the highest power of 2 dividing the product. The substantial power of 2 divides the product when a=1, b ranging up to 20, leading to the maximum 2-exponent related to the number of factors involved, specifically 2^19 dividing the product. Therefore, the greatest such n is 19.
