The solutions require points (p.1, p.2) where the two quadratic equations share roots, implying p.1 = p.2, reducing the problem to the number of solutions where a quadratic has roots with coefficients within bounds. Only points on the line p.1 = p.2 may satisfy the requirement, and for each such point, there is a corresponding quadratic with roots satisfying these conditions. The bounds suggest counting integer points with p.1 = p.2 in [-20,20], leading to 41 points, each satisfying the conditions.
