Ground Truth Answer: 14
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us an identity that must hold for all real x: (x + a)(x + 8) = x² + b x + 24

2. Let's expand the left side:
   (x + a)(x + 8) = x² + (8 + a)x + 8a

3. Comparing coefficients with the right side x² + b x + 24:
   - For x²: 1 = 1 (matches)
   - For x: 8 + a = b
   - Constant term: 8a = 24 ⇒ a = 3

4. Substituting a = 3 into the x coefficient equation:
   8 + 3 = b ⇒ b = 11

5. Therefore, a + b = 3 + 11 = 14

The ground truth answer is 14, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 8, which is incorrect.
