Ground Truth Answer: (4, 2)
Proposed Answer:  (2, 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for natural numbers (m,n) where 0 < m and 0 < n that satisfy the equation:
   (1/n²) - (3/(2n³)) = (1/m²)

2. The ground truth answer is (4,2). Let's verify it:
   (1/2²) - (3/(2*2³)) = (1/4) - (3/16) = (4/16 - 3/16) = 1/16
   (1/4²) = 1/16
   This checks out.

3. The proposed answer is (2,1):
   (1/1²) - (3/(2*1³)) = 1 - 1.5 = -0.5
   (1/2²) = 0.25
   -0.5 ≠ 0.25, so this doesn't satisfy the equation.

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the given equation, while the ground truth answer does.

<<<False>>>
