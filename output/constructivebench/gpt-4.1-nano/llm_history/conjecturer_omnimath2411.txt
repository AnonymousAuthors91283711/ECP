    (a b : ℝ)
    (hab : 20 = 4 * a ^ 2 + 9 * b ^ 2 ∧ 20 + 12 * a * b = (2 * a + 3 * b) ^ 2) :
    a * b = omnimath2411_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The conditions simplify to a quadratic form where (2a + 3b)^2 = 20 + 12ab. Rewriting, we find that ab = 0 when the equations hold, leading to a or b being zero; substituting back confirms no contradiction. The form suggests the answer involves the roots of the initial quadratic, implying a potential value for ab is zero in general. Thus, a generalized answer is zero.
