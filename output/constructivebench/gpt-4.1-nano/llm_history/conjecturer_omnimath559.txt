The pattern indicates the multiplication \( (10W + E) \times (100E + 10Y + E) \) simplifies to the number \( S C E N E \), with \( W=3 \). Assuming \( E, Y, C, N \) are digits 1–9, and using the given injectivity and non-zero constraints, the consistent solution is when \( S=1, C=9, N=2 \), and \( E \) matches the repeated digit pattern.

Based on the enumeration for this puzzle and the derived pattern, the final value for \( S \) should be 1, reflecting that the first digit of the product \( SCE N E \) is 1 for the valid solution.

Thus, the closed-form answer in Lean is:

<<<1>>>
