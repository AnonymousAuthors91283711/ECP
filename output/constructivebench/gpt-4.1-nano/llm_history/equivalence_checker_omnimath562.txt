Ground Truth Answer: 720
Proposed Answer: 960
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a natural number n between 1 and 999 (0 < n < 1000) that has exactly 29 proper divisors (divisors other than itself).

2. The number of proper divisors is related to the prime factorization. If n = p₁^a₁ * p₂^a₂ * ... * p_k^a_k, then the total number of divisors is (a₁+1)(a₂+1)...(a_k+1), and the number of proper divisors is this minus 1.

3. We need (a₁+1)(a₂+1)...(a_k+1) - 1 = 29, meaning the total number of divisors should be 30.

4. Factorizing 30 gives possible exponent combinations:
   - 30
   - 15×2
   - 10×3
   - 6×5
   - 5×3×2

5. Now let's check the proposed answers:
   - 720 = 2^4 × 3^2 × 5^1 → (4+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 5×3×2 = 30 divisors (29 proper)
   - 960 = 2^6 × 3^1 × 5^1 → (6+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 7×2×2 = 28 divisors (27 proper)

The ground truth answer (720) is correct as it has exactly 29 proper divisors, while the proposed answer (960) does not.
