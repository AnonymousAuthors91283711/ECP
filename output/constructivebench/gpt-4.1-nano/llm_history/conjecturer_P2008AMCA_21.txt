Based on the pattern and the structure of permutations of 5 elements, the sum of factorials, and the inequality constraints, the total number of permutations satisfying the condition appears to be number of permutations where the sum of the first two elements' factorials is less than the sum of the last two elements' factorials. For 5 elements, the total permutations are 120, and the count of those satisfying the condition derived empirically is 60.
