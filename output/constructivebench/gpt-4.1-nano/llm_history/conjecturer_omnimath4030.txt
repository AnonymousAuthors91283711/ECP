The problem involves positive integers n and functions x with the sum condition involving powers and reciprocals. The sum constraint resembles a harmonic or geometric relation with squares, valid for n=2 only, where selecting x₀=1 and x₁=1 satisfies sum = 1. For n>2, no solutions fit the strict sum condition with all positive xᵢ. Therefore, the final set contains only n=2.
