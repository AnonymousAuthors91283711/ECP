The problem seeks the minimal positive integer n divisible by three distinct natural numbers a < b < c summing to 2022. To minimize n, choose the smallest a, then b, then c. Given the enumeration hints and the minimal configuration, the minimal n is achieved when a = 1, b = 2, c = 2019, yielding n = lcm(1, 2, 2019) = 2 * 2019 = 4038. 

<<<2 * 2019>>>
