The pattern suggests that the solutions relate to functions with additive properties and symmetry; specifically, the function behaves like \(f(n) = a \cdot n\) for some constant \(a\), considering the additivity \(f(xy) = f(x) + f(y)\). For the infinite symmetric set condition, the only consistent functions are linear functions with \(a = 0\) or \(a = p\) where \(p\) is prime, capturing the growth and symmetry conditions. 

Final answer: <<<fun a p : ℕ => if p.Prime then a * p else a>>>
