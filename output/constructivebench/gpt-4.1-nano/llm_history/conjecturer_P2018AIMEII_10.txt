The set of functions \(f : Fin 5 \to Fin 5\) satisfying \(f(f(x)) = f(f(f(x)))\) entails that \(f\) stabilizes or is idempotent after certain iterations, implying the functions are either fixed or become fixed under composition. The key patterns are functions with images of size 1, 2, 3, or 5, with functions of size 4 impossible. Enumerations suggest the count matches a pattern of powers or subset counts.

Following the pattern, the total number corresponds to \(5^3 - 5^2 = 125 - 25 = 100\), considering the stabilizing functions.
