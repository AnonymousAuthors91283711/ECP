Given the sum of square roots equals sqrt(2014), each of a,b,c must be bounded below 2014, and the pattern suggests all solutions correspond to triples with a,b,c summing to 2014 in their square values. The set resembles triples where a,b,c are perfect squares summing to 2014, i.e., a = x^2, b = y^2, c = z^2 with x + y + z = √2014, which is not necessarily integer. Alternatively, considering the enumeration hints that the solutions are all triples satisfying a + b + c = 2014, with a,b,c nonnegative integers, derived from the sum of roots being sqrt(2014), which can be estimated approximately around triples where a + b + c ≈ 3*2014, but since sum of roots is fixed, the set of solutions simplifies to triples satisfying a + b + c = 2014, with individual a,b,c suitable to their root constraints. 

However, the exact matching and direct pattern matching from the enumeration strongly indicates that:

<<<{(a, b, c) : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ | a + b + c = 2014}>>>
