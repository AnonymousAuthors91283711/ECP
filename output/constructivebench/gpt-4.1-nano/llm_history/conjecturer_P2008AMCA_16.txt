The difference d = log(a^2 * b^5) appears additive and linear with equal steps. The terms suggest a geometric progression involving exponents, leading to the pattern in the sum of exponents or logs. The third term log(a^8 * b^15) matches the pattern, with exponent increments from 5 to 8 in a and 12 to 15 in b. The sequence aligns with index-based exponents: at step k, exponents are 3 + 5(k-1), 7 + 5(k-1). Given the pattern, the value at k=12 is associated with exponents 3 + 5*11 = 58 for a and 7 + 5*11 = 62 for b. Their logs sum to log(a^58 * b^62).  
Final answer: <<<58>>>
