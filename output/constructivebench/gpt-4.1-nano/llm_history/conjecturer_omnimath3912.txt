The recurrence relation indicates a sequence with initial terms and a recurrence akin to Fibonacci with a constant addition. Testing initial n ≥ 3, the set likely contains Fibonacci numbers shifted. Recognizing sequences defined by similar relations, the pattern suggests that omnimath3912_answer = {F_{n+1} | n ≥ 3}. Lean set notation: {m | ∃ k ≥ 2, m = fib (k + 1)} simplifies to {fib m | m ≥ 4}. But as a set of ℕ, the simplest form is:

<<<{k | k ≥ 4}>>

since Fibonacci numbers start at 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ... and for n ≥ 3, the result corresponds to Fibonacci indices ≥ 4 (i.e., starting from 3).[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The problem describes a sequence \( a : \mathbb{Fin} (n+2) \to \mathbb{R} \) with boundary conditions and a recurrence involving the product \( a_i \cdot a_{i+1} + 1 \). The pattern resembles sequences related to Fibonacci numbers, where the recurrence is similar to \( a_{i+2} = a_i a_{i+1} + 1 \). Knowing the Fibonacci sequence satisfies \( F_{k+2} = F_{k+1} + F_k \), the recurrence resembles a multiplicative form associated with Fibonacci indices.

Testing initial \( n \geq 3 \):
- For \( n = 3 \), the sequence's indices suggest values starting at certain Fibonacci numbers, notably with indices ≥ 4 (since Fibonacci numbers start \( 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \dots \)), so the set of possible \( n \) aligns with Fibonacci numbers from index 4 onward.

The minimal \( n \) is 3 and the behavior indicates the set includes Fibonacci numbers with indices ≥ 4.

Thus, the set corresponds exactly to the Fibonacci numbers \( F_{k} \) with \( k \ge 4 \), i.e., the set \( \{ F_{k} \mid k \ge 4 \} \).

Expressed in Lean:
- Since the Fibonacci sequence starts at \( F_1 = 1, F_2=1 \), the set of Fibonacci numbers with \( k \ge 4 \) is \( \{ F_k \mid k \ge 4 \} \).

Therefore, the concise set notation:
- \(\{ n \in \mathbb{N} \mid n \ge 3 \}\) or, more specifically, the Fibonacci numbers with indices ≥ 4.

**Final Answer:**

<<<{k | k ≥ 4}>>>

This set captures the indices of Fibonacci numbers starting from 4, which corresponds to the values of \( a_i \) consistent with the problem's boundary and recurrence conditions.
