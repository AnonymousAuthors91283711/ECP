theorem omnimath2415 :
  ({(x, y, z) : ℤ × ℤ × ℤ | x + y + z = 525 ∧ 7 ∣ x ∧ 5 ∣ y ∧ 3 ∣ z}.ncard = omnimath2415_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests x is divisible by 7, y by 5, z by 3, with x + y + z = 525. For each fixed z divisible by 3, y divisible by 5, x divisible by 7, the count corresponds to solutions of these divisibility constraints summing to 525. 

The minimal basic divisibility cases give the count as the number of solutions scaled by the product of the divisibility factors. 

Hence, the total count is obtained by dividing 525 into parts compatible with divisibility constraints, leading to:

<<<525 * 7 * 5 * 3>>>
