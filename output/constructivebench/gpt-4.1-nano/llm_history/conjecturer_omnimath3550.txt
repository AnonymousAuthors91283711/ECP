The polynomial P(m) factors into quadratic polynomials with coefficients involving (2m+4). For P(m) to factor into A*B with A,B ≠ 0, the quadratic discriminant must be a perfect square. To ensure factorization, 4(m+2)^2 must be a perfect square; thus, m relies on parameters that make (m+2)√2 rational, which is impossible unless m is constrained. Factoring leads to solutions where m relates via 2m+4 = k² with k ∈ ℤ, i.e., m = (k² - 4)/2. To ensure integer polynomials A and B, m must satisfy m = (k² - 4)/2 with k even, so:

The proposed answer involves a set defined via the existence of an integer `k` such that certain relations hold. The error relates to the expression `2 * k ∈ 2 * ℤ`, which is semantically redundant because `2 * k` is always in `2 * ℤ` for any `k : ℤ`. Furthermore, to define the set of `m` for which `P m` factors into two non-zero polynomials, the key is to understand the structure of the roots of the polynomial `P m`.

Given that:
\[ P m = X^4 - C_{2m + 4} X^2 + C_{(m-2)^2} \]
which appears quadratic in \(X^2\). The roots of this polynomial in terms of \(X^2\) are determined by the quadratic formula:
\[ t^2 - C_{2m + 4} t + C_{(m-2)^2} = 0 \]

The discriminant involving binomial coefficients reduces to a perfect square condition, leading to the relation between \(m\) and \(k\). From the pattern similar to the enumerated solutions, the set of \(m\) where \(P m\) factors can be characterized in terms of perfect square integers \(k^2\) satisfying \(m = (k^2 - 4)/2\).

Therefore, the corrected and generalized form should explicitly specify that \(k\) is an integer such that:
- \(k^2 \ge 4\) (to ensure real roots — though this is not strictly necessary here),
- \(m = (k^2 - 4)/2\),
- and that the roots are rational/integers accordingly.

To avoid the problematic part `2 * k ∈ 2 * ℤ` and write it cleanly, it is better to simply specify \(k \in ℤ\) and the relation involving \(m\).

Final answer:

<<<{ m : ℤ | ∃ k : ℤ, m = (k^2 - 4)/2 }>>>
