theorem olympiadbench2950 (x y : ℝ) :
    (x^2 + y^2 = 6 * y - 4 * x + 12 ∧ 4 * y = x^2 + 4 * x + 12) ↔ (x, y) ∈ olympiadbench2950_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(-6, 6), (2, 6)}
Proposed Answer: {
  (x, y) |
  (x = 1 + √2 ∧ y = (x^2)/4 + x + 3) ∨
  (x = 1 - √2 ∧ y = (x^2)/4 + x + 3) ∨
  (x = -1 + √2 ∧ y = (x^2)/4 + x + 3) ∨
  (x = -1 - √2 ∧ y = (x^2)/4 + x + 3)
}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives two equations:
   - x² + y² = 6y - 4x + 12
   - 4y = x² + 4x + 12

2. The ground truth answer gives two exact solutions: (-6, 6) and (2, 6)

3. The proposed answer gives solutions in terms of √2, which suggests it's solving a different equation or making an error in solving the system.

Verification:
- Plugging (-6, 6) into both equations:
  First equation: 36 + 36 = 36 + 24 + 12 → 72 = 72 ✓
  Second equation: 24 = 36 - 24 + 12 → 24 = 24 ✓
- Plugging (2, 6) into both equations:
  First equation: 4 + 36 = 36 - 8 + 12 → 40 = 40 ✓
  Second equation: 24 = 4 + 8 + 12 → 24 = 24 ✓

The proposed answer's solutions don't match these points. The √2 terms suggest it might be solving a quadratic from the second equation incorrectly or mixing up equations.
