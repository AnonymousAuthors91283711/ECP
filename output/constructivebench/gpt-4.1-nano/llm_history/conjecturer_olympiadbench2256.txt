theorem olympiadbench2256 (x : ℝ) (hx : x > 0) :
    (2 : ℝ)^(log (x^2) / log 10) = 3 * (2 : ℝ)^(1 + log x / log 10) + 16 ↔ x = olympiadbench2256_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
// Observing pattern in enumerated answers, the equation simplifies to x = 10^k for some k such that the exponents match.
// Simplify: 2^{log(x^2)/log 10} = 2^{2 log x / log 10} = 10^{2 log x / log 10} = x^2.
// Rewrite the equation: x^2 = 3 * 2^{1 + log x / log 10} + 16.
// Note that 2^{log x / log 10} = x.
// So the RHS becomes 3 * 2 * x + 16 = 6x + 16.
// Equation reduces to: x^2 = 6x + 16.
// Final answer: x^2 - 6x - 16 = 0 ⇒ x = (6 ± √(36 + 64))/2 = (6 ± √100)/2 = (6 ± 10)/2.
// Therefore, solutions are x = 8 or x = -2, but since x > 0, answer is 8.
