Ground Truth Answer: 2 / 3
Proposed Answer: (1 + sqrt 2) / 3
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem gives us three equations:
   - q ≤ p
   - p + q + 1/6 = 1 → p + q = 5/6
   - p² + q² + (1/6)² = 1/2 → p² + q² = 17/36

2. From p + q = 5/6, we can express q = 5/6 - p

3. Substitute into the second equation:
   p² + (5/6 - p)² = 17/36
   p² + 25/36 - (5/3)p + p² = 17/36
   2p² - (5/3)p + 8/36 = 0
   2p² - (5/3)p + 2/9 = 0

4. Solving this quadratic equation:
   p = [5/3 ± √((25/9) - 16/9)] / 4
   p = [5/3 ± √(9/9)] / 4
   p = [5/3 ± 1] / 4

5. This gives two solutions:
   p = (5/3 + 1)/4 = (8/3)/4 = 2/3
   p = (5/3 - 1)/4 = (2/3)/4 = 1/6

6. The condition q ≤ p eliminates p = 1/6 (since q would be 5/6 - 1/6 = 2/3 > p)

The ground truth answer (2/3) is correct, while the proposed answer ((1 + sqrt 2)/3) is incorrect.
