The sum of a geometric series with ratio cos θ' is 1 / (1 - cos θ') when |cos θ'| < 1. Given sin θ' and T, cos θ' = sqrt(T^2 - 64) / T, which is less than 1 for T > 8. Thus, the greatest x is 1 / (1 - cos θ').

The errors in the current proposal stem from trying to directly assign a descriptive sentence as a value to `olympiadbench2836_answer`, which Lean cannot interpret as an `ℝ`. As per requirements, the answer should be a closed-form real number. The logical reasoning is that for the sum of the geometric series \(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (\cos \theta')^n\), the sum in the case \(|\cos \theta'| < 1\) is \(\frac{1}{1 - \cos \theta'}\). Given that \(\cos \theta' = \sqrt{\frac{T^2 - 64}{T^2}}\), the sum becomes \(\frac{1}{1 - \sqrt{\frac{T^2 - 64}{T^2}}}\).

Since the problem states \(T = 32\), the explicit answer simplifies to \(\frac{1}{1 - \sqrt{\frac{32^2 - 64}{32^2}}}\).

Calculating, \(\frac{1}{1 - \sqrt{\frac{1024 - 64}{1024}}} = \frac{1}{1 - \sqrt{\frac{960}{1024}}} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{\sqrt{960}}{32}}\).

Now, \(\sqrt{960}\) simplifies to \(4 \sqrt{15}\), so the answer simplifies further to:

\(\frac{1}{1 - \frac{4 \sqrt{15}}{32}} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{\sqrt{15}}{8}}\).

Thus, the final closed-form in Lean is:

<<<fun T => 1 / (1 - sqrt ( (T^2 - 64)/ T^2 ))>>>

In particular, substituting \(T=32\), this evaluates to \(\frac{1}{1 - \frac{\sqrt{15}}{8}}\), a real number, consistent with the expected answer type.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The core issue in the proposed answer is that `olympiadbench2836_answer` is an `abbrev` expecting a value of type `ℝ`, but the current definition is a function `ℝ → ℝ`. Since `IsGreatest` is about a specific *value* in `ℝ`, not a *function*, the answer should be a fixed real number, not a function. 

The expression `1 / (1 - √((T^2 - 64)/ T^2 ))` simplifies to `1 / (1 - √(1 - 64 / T^2))`, but this is a function of `T`. If we want a *fixed answer* for the problem, probably the intended constant answer (from the pattern of the problem and possible context) is the value at the specified `T=32`. 

Calculate this value for `T = 32`:
- `(T^2 - 64)/ T^2 = (1024 - 64)/1024 = 960 / 1024`. 
- √(960/1024) = √(15/16) = √15 / 4.

Thus,
`1 / (1 - √15 / 4) = 1 / ((4 - √15)/4) = 4 / (4 - √15)`.

To rationalize the denominator:
`4 / (4 - √15) * (4 + √15) / (4 + √15) = (4 * (4 + √15)) / ((4)^2 - (√15)^2) = (4 * (4 + √15)) / (16 - 15) = 4 * (4 + √15) / 1 = 4*(4 + √15) = 16 + 4√15`.

Hence, the fixed real number answer is `16 + 4 * √15`.

Final fix: set the answer to that constant value.

<<<16 + 4 * √15>>>
