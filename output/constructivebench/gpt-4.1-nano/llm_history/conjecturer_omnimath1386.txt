: (∏ n in (Set.Icc 2 6 : Set ℕ), ((n ^ 3 : ℚ) - 1) / (n ^ 3 + 1) = omnimath1386_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Given the pattern in (∏ n in [2..6], (n^3 - 1)/(n^3 + 1)), the product simplifies to a telescoping form leading to a clean rational number. The product telescopes to (2^3 - 1)/(2^3 + 1) * (3^3 - 1)/(3^3 + 1) * ... * (6^3 - 1)/(6^3 + 1). Recognizing the pattern as (n - 1)/(n + 1), the entire product simplifies to (2 - 1)/(6 + 1) = 1/7. 

Final answer: <<<1/7>>>
