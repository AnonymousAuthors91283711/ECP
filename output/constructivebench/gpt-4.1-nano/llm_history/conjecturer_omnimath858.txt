Because the permutation swaps the elements in 𝟏𝟎 and satisfies p(p i) = i with no fixed points (all i are moved), p must be a product of 5 disjoint transpositions. Each transposition swaps 2 elements, covering all 10 elements with no fixed points, and with each such permutation, the number of arrangements is (10−1)!! = 945. 

Therefore, the answer is 945. 

<<<945>>>
