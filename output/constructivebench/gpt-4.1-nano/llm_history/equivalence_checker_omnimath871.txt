noncomputable abbrev omnimath871_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath871 : 
    sin (arcsin 0.4 + arcsin 0.5) * sin (arcsin 0.5 - arcsin 0.4) = omnimath871_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 9 / 100
Proposed Answer: 0.5 * (sqrt (1 - 0.4 * 0.4) * sqrt (1 - 0.5 * 0.5) - 0.4 * 0.5)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer step by step.

1. The problem involves trigonometric identities for arcsin and sin functions.
2. The ground truth answer is a simple fraction 9/100 (which equals 0.09).
3. The proposed answer is an expression involving square roots and multiplication.

Let's evaluate the proposed answer:
0.5 * (sqrt(1 - 0.4²) * sqrt(1 - 0.5²) - 0.4*0.5)
= 0.5 * (sqrt(0.84) * sqrt(0.75) - 0.1)
= 0.5 * (0.9165 * 0.8660 - 0.1) [approximate values]
≈ 0.5 * (0.7937 - 0.1)
≈ 0.5 * 0.6937
≈ 0.34685

This is clearly not equal to 0.09 (9/100). The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth.

Moreover, the correct approach would be to use trigonometric identities:
sin(A+B)sin(A-B) = sin²A - sin²B
where A = arcsin(0.5), B = arcsin(0.4)
= 0.5² - 0.4² = 0.25 - 0.16 = 0.09 = 9/100

<<<False>>>
