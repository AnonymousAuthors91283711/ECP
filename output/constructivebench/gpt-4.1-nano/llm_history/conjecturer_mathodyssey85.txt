The problem revolves around maximizing the norm \(\|(a, 0) + (0, b) + D\|\) with \(D\) on the circle \( \{ D : \operatorname{dist}((0,4), D) = 1 \} \), which has radius 1 centered at (0, 4). To achieve the maximum, choose \(D = (0, 5)\) to add to the vector \((a, b)\). The norm then becomes \(\|(a, b + 5)\|\), maximized when \(a = 0\) and \(b + 5\) is maximized, which is when \(b = 1\). The resulting critical value is \(a^2 + (b+5)^2\), with the maximum at \(a = 0, b = 1\), giving \(0^2 + (1+5)^2 = 36\). The least value of \(s\) such that the supremum over all \(a'\), \(b'\) is 6 thus corresponds to the case \(a' = 0\), \(b' = 1\).
