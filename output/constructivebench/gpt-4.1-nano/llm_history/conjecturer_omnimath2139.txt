  IsLeast {z : ℝ | ∃ x y : ℝ, z = (x * y)^2 + (x + 7)^2 + (2 * y + 7)^2} omnimath2139_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the sum of squares and the structure, the minimum occurs at x=y=0, yielding (0)^2+(7)^2+(7)^2=0+49+49=98. The pattern suggests the minimal sum is achieved at these critical points. 

<<<98>>>
