  (∀ x > 0, f x > 0) ∧ 
  (∀ x > 0, ∀ y > 0, ∀ z > 0, x * y * z = 1 → f (x + 1/y) + f (y + 1/z) + f (z + 1/x) = 1) 
  ↔ f ∈ omnimath171_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
Given the symmetry and conditions involving reciprocals and additive transformations, the consistent solution is the constant function f(x) = 1/3 for all x > 0. This satisfies the functional equation and positivity.
