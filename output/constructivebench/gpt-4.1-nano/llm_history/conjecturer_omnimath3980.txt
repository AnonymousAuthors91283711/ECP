The sequence a n is defined by a 1=2 and a (n+1)=a n + sSup {p | p prime ∧ p ≤ a n}, with each step adding the maximum prime ≤ a n. This resembles the sum of primes up to a n, leading to a recursive growth similar to a quadratic function.  
Hence, the set of all a i’s equals {m² | m ∈ ℕ} starting from 2, with m ∈ ℕ≥1, since the initial value a 1=2 is 1²+1.  
Final answer: <<< {m^2 | m ≥ 1} >>>
