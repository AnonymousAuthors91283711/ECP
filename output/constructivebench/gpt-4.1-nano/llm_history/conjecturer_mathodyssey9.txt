The pattern suggests the answer should relate to the structure of sets with ordered triples and divisibility. Given the constraints and the trends in enumeration, the key likely simplifies to a function involving exponential growth in a, b, c. The enumeration hints at the value 7, possibly reflecting specific valid triples; thus, a natural conjecture is 7.
