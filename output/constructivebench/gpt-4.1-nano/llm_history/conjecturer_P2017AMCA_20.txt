The key condition: (log_b a b)^2017 = log_b (a^2017) b simplifies to b^{(log_b a)^2017} = a^{2017}, implying a = b^{(log_b a)^{2017/2017}} = b^{(log_b a)} = a. So all pairs satisfy the condition trivially, bounded by 2 ≤ b ≤ 200.

Therefore, the number of such pairs is the count of b in 2..200 times the possible a for each b.

Since a > 0 and if 0 < a, then for fixed b, all a in (b^{something}, ∞) satisfy the relation, but within the set, the measure reduces to b from the logs and applying constraints.

Given the structure, the total count simplifies to the number of possible b's multiplied by infinity or a relevant sum, but since the set's measure is bounded by the discrete b's, the total count is 199 (from 2 to 200).

Thus, the answer is 199.

<<<199>>>
