The answer involves the count of natural numbers n > 0 satisfying a certain inequality in logs. When analyzing the inequalities and the domain constraints, the pattern suggests the count is related to the interval of n that gives logs between 1 and 10, excluding some boundary cases. 

Based on the enumeration hints, the total count of such n is 7.
