  (omnimath4151_answer k) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Given the nature of combinatorial bounds and the pattern in enumerated answers, a plausible closed-form estimate of the minimal s is \( 4k^2 + 4k + 1 \). This corresponds to the minimal size of a set covering a square grid of side length \( 2k+1 \), matching a square of side \( 2k+1 \).

Final answer:
<<<fun k : ℕ => 4 * k * k + 4 * k + 1>>>
