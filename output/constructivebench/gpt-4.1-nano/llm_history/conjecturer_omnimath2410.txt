theorem omnimath2410
  (A B C AB AC BC : ℝ) 
  (h₁ : sin B / sin C = AC / AB) 
  (h₂ : sin C / sin B = AB / AC) 
  (h₃ : sin A / (sin B * sin C) = BC / (AC * AB)) :
  (sin B ^ 2 + sin C ^ 2 - sin A ^ 2) / (sin B * sin C) = omnimath2410_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the given identities and symmetry, the expression simplifies to 1, reflecting the consistency of the sine ratios and the Law of Sines. The enumeration hint suggests the answer is 1.
