abbrev omnimath4114_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath4114 : 
  let L := (10^2022 - 1) / 9
  (digits 10 (9 * L^2 + 2 * L)).sum = omnimath4114_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests that the sum of digits relates to \( 10^{n} - 1 \) structures, and scaled squares of such numbers. Recognizing the form of \( L \) as a repunit, its square sums interact with powers of 10. The pattern of solutions indicates an answer proportional to \( (10^{2022} - 1) \times 2 \).
