Analyzing the polynomial's structure with parameters p.1 and p.2, the solutions depend on the existence of real roots for a quartic in x, which hinges on the coefficients. The pattern suggests the presence of parameters where the roots are guaranteed. The bounding box is [0,1] × [0,1], so the critical values correspond to boundary cases. The polynomial reduces to a form where the parameters maintain the roots within that rectangle, leading to the maximum value of p.2 = p.1 cubed at p.1 = 1, with root multiplicities. Thus, the answer appears to be the maximum p.2 at p.1=1, giving 1.
