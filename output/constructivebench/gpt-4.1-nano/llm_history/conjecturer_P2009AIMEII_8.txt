Given the sum over pairs where d and l satisfy d = l, d = l + 1, or l = d + 1, and the symmetry of p, the total probability simplifies to considering only the cases d = l and either d = l + 1 or l = d + 1, which are symmetric. After summation, numerator is 1, and denominator is 6, leading to the fraction 1/6 with numerator 1 and denominator 6, coprime.
