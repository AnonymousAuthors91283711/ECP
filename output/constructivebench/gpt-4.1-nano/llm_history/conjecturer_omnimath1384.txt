Given the polynomial \(f\) with roots and the conditions, the key is to relate \(P\)'s evaluations at specific points based on \(f\)'s roots and symmetry. The pattern from enumerated answers suggests a ratio involving roots at 1 and -1, and symmetry indicates the final ratio simplifies to \(-1\). Thus, in Lean:

<<<(-1 : ℚ)>>>

This rational number represents the constant ratio derived from the polynomial properties and root evaluations.
