The problem seeks the smallest natural number s where four distinct squares a, b, c, d satisfy a^b = c^d and their sum is s. The shortest such s corresponds to the smallest sum for the minimal set of distinct squares with the specified relation. Based on known small solutions to such exponential equations, the minimal example is with (a, b, c, d) = (1, 4, 2, 2), since 1^4 = 1 = 2^2, and the sum is 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 9. 

Final answer: <<<9>>>
