Ground Truth Answer: 13725
Proposed Answer: 2015
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating the base-2 logarithm of the real part of a complex product involving roots of unity.

2. The product ∏(1 + exp(2πi*a*b/2015)) over a,b from 0 to 2014 is related to the number of solutions to certain equations modulo 2015.

3. The ground truth answer is 13725, which comes from the fact that 2015 = 5 × 13 × 31, and the calculation involves counting solutions to quadratic equations modulo each prime factor.

4. The proposed answer 2015 is simply the modulus used in the problem, but it doesn't correctly represent the logarithmic scale of the solution.

5. The correct answer should be much larger than 2015 (which it is - 13725), as it involves products of terms that grow exponentially.
