Ground Truth Answer: 47/300
Proposed Answer: (1/3 : ℚ) * (2/3 : ℚ) ^ (25 - 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem is about calculating the probability that in a random permutation of 25 people, Charlie is adjacent to either Chris or Abby in the ordering.

2. The ground truth answer is 47/300, which is approximately 0.1567.

3. The proposed answer is (1/3)*(2/3)^24, which is approximately 1.18 × 10^-5 - an extremely small number.

The proposed answer is clearly incorrect because:
- The probability should be reasonably large (as 47/300 shows)
- The proposed answer decays exponentially with n, which doesn't make sense for this problem
- The structure of the proposed answer doesn't match the combinatorial nature of the problem
