The pattern suggests that (m, n) satisfy m * n - 1 divides (n^2 - n + 1)^2. For divisibility, when m = (n^2 - n + 1)^2 / (m * n - 1), then m * n - 1 divides this square. To eliminate the existential, observe that m * n - 1 must be a divisor of (n^2 - n + 1)^2, and the structure suggests m is proportional to (n^2 - n + 1)^2 / (m * n - 1). A straightforward closed form is obtained by setting m equal to (n^2 - n + 1)^2 divided by (m * n - 1), leading to a simplified form involving factors of (n^2 - n + 1)^2. Based on the pattern and the divisibility, the set of solutions corresponds to pairs where m * n - 1 is a divisor of (n^2 - n + 1)^2 and is rationally proportional. Hence, the universal solution encompasses m and n such that m * n - 1 divides (n^2 - n + 1)^2. Consequently, the set can be expressed as:

The core logical structure is that (m, n) satisfy that m * n - 1 divides (n^2 - n + 1)^2, with m > 0 and n > 0. Since m and n are natural numbers with m > 0, n > 0, and the divisibility condition, the natural closed-form description involves fixing n > 0 and allowing m to be any positive divisor of (n^2 - n + 1)^2 plus 1 (since m * n - 1 divides (n^2 - n + 1)^2, and m > 0). However, to express the set directly, the most consistent and straightforward expression in Lean is:

<<<{(m, n) | n > 0 ∧ (n^2 - n + 1)^2 ∣ (m * n - 1)}>>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The root cause of the error is in the syntax of the set comprehension and the use of the divisibility operator `∣`. In Lean, to express that `(m * n - 1)` is divisible by `(n^2 - n + 1)^2`, we need to write `((n^2 - n + 1)^2) ∣ (m * n - 1)` explicitly and ensure the variables are properly scoped. 

In the current code, the set comprehension lacks parentheses and uses a malformed syntax: set notation and the element variables `(m, n)` are not introduced with the proper syntax. The `∣` operator also must be prefixed with parentheses to ensure it is interpreted correctly. Also, the iterateer variables should be explicitly declared in the set comprehension.

A correct syntax for the desired set should be:

```lean
{p : ℕ × ℕ | p.1 > 0 ∧ p.2 > 0 ∧ ((p.2 ^ 2 - p.2 + 1) ^ 2) ∣ (p.1 * p.2 - 1)}
```

or, perhaps more clearly, by destructuring the pair `(m, n)`:
```lean
{(m, n) : ℕ × ℕ | m > 0 ∧ n > 0 ∧ ((n^2 - n + 1)^2) ∣ (m * n - 1)}
```

Finally, ensure the expression in `abbrev` is grouped correctly.

**Proposed fixed answer:**

<<<{(m, n) : ℕ × ℕ | m > 0 ∧ n > 0 ∧ ((n^2 - n + 1)^2) ∣ (m * n - 1)}>>>
