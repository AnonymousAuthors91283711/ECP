Within the problem's context, the least n > 0 with gcd(n^3, n!) ≥ 100 suggests checking minimal n where n! contains at least two factors of 2, 5, or 11 to reach gcd ≥ 100. For small n, gcd increases with n, reaching ≥ 100 at n = 10 because gcd(n^3, n!) ≥ 100 starting from n=10. The minimal such n satisfying the conditions is thus 10.
