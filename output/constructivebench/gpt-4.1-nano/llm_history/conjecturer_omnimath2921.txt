Given that the set contains the least common multiple of 3, 5, 7, and 9, and 1 is divisible by none of these, the minimal positive such k is their LCM. The LCM of 3, 5, 7, and 9 is 3² * 5 * 7 = 945.

The current proposal attempts to assign an entire sentence (a natural language explanation) to a constant of type ℕ, which is invalid in Lean. The variable `omnimath2921_answer` should be defined as a concrete natural number, i.e., the known least common multiple of 3, 5, 7, and 9.

The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers can be computed directly: 
- 3² (since 9 = 3²)
- multiplied by 5 
- multiplied by 7

Thus, the answer is \(3^2 \times 5 \times 7 = 9 \times 5 \times 7 = 315 \).

To fix the error, I will define `omnimath2921_answer` as this explicit value, and the proof will assert that this value is indeed the least such number satisfying the divisibility conditions.

The corrected Lean code is:

<<<945>>>

But as per the explanation above, actually 945 corresponds to the least common multiple of 3, 5, 7, and 9.

Calculating: LCM of (3, 5, 7, 9) = 3² × 5 × 7 = 9 × 5 × 7 = 315.

Wait, this suggests a correction: the actual LCM is 315, not 945.

Double-check: 3²=9, 5, 7.

LCM(3,5,7,9): 

- 3 and 9: 9 (since 9 divisible by 3),
- 5 and 7: 5 and 7.

But the LCM needs to cover all prime factors:

- 3² (for 9),
- 5 (prime),
- 7 (prime).

LCM = 3² × 5 × 7 = 9 × 5 × 7 = 315.

So the minimal number divisible by 3, 5, 7, and 9 is 315, since 9 divides 315, and the others do too.

Thus, `omnimath2921_answer := 315`.

Therefore, the corrected code is:

<<<315>>>
