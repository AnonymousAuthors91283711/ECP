Since the set S contains both positive and negative elements, and the goal is to find the maximum of all products a * b * c with distinct a, b, c in S, the maximum product occurs with the largest three elements and the product of the three largest (positive or negative) elements considering multiplication signs.

In S, the three largest elements are 5, 7, and 3, leading to the maximum product 5 * 7 * 3 = 105.

Answer: <<<105>>>
