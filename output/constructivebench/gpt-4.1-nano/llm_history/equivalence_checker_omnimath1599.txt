Ground Truth Answer: 5 / 8
Proposed Answer: (3/2) - 1
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
We're given two angles A and B with:
1. sin A + sin B = 1
2. cos A + cos B = 3/2
And we need to find cos(A - B).

Ground Truth Answer: 5/8 (which is 0.625)
Proposed Answer: (3/2) - 1 = 1/2 (which is 0.5)

Mathematical Verification:
To find cos(A - B), we can use the identity:
cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B

From the given equations, let's square and add them:
(sin A + sin B)² + (cos A + cos B)² = 1² + (3/2)²
=> sin²A + sin²B + 2sinA sinB + cos²A + cos²B + 2cosA cosB = 1 + 9/4
=> (sin²A + cos²A) + (sin²B + cos²B) + 2(cosA cosB + sinA sinB) = 13/4
=> 1 + 1 + 2cos(A - B) = 13/4
=> 2 + 2cos(A - B) = 13/4
=> 2cos(A - B) = 5/4
=> cos(A - B) = 5/8

The ground truth answer matches our derivation exactly. The proposed answer (3/2 - 1 = 1/2) is incorrect as it doesn't match the derived value of 5/8.
