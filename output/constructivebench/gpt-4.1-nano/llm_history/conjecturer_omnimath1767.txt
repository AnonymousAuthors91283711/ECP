Given the problem involves sum of two cubes equal to a number greater than 1729, and from the enumerated pattern, the minimal such number exceeding 1729 that can be written as two different sums of two cubes appears to be 4104, corresponding to known representations: 4104 = 16^3 + 2^3 = 15^3 + 9^3. Thus, the minimal n satisfying the conditions is 4104.
