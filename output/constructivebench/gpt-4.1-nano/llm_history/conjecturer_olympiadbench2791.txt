<<<-225>>>

The polynomial factors into roots at a ± d and a ± 3d, leading to coefficients summing to zero, implying the quadratic coefficient equals - (sum of roots). Calculating the sum of roots: (a - 3d) + (a - d) + (a + d) + (a + 3d) = 4a. The quadratic coefficient relates to sum of pairwise products, which sum to -225 for the constant term. Solving yields the value of the polynomial coefficient as -225, and the coefficient matches the polynomial's specific term, producing the answer -225.
