abbrev omnimath3647_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3647 (k : ℕ) (hk : 0 < k ∧ k < 202) :
    (∃ (n : ℕ), (∑ i in Finset.range k, fract ((i.succ * n : ℝ) / 202)) = k / 2) ↔ k ∈ omnimath3647_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The problem involves finding k where a sum of fractional parts equals k/2. Recognizing the pattern, the sum relates to whether n is even or odd, impacting fractional sum to be k/2. 

Final answer: 
<<<{k | 2 ∣ k}>>>
