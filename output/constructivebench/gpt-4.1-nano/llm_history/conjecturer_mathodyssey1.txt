The problem asks for the minimal size of a subset T of {1,...,2024} with mutually coprime elements containing a prime. The smallest such set must have at least one prime, and if it has more, coprimality forces elements to be pairwise coprime, which is maximized by singleton or prime sets. Since primes are pairwise coprime, the minimal size with the property is 1.
