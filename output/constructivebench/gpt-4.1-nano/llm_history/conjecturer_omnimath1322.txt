The enumerated answers suggest roots of unity with quadratic relations, hence the typical roots of quadratic equations \(z^2 + a z + b=0\) where solutions are roots of unity. For quadratic roots satisfying unity properties, the most general solutions are 1, -1, i, -i. Their multiplicity and the relation between \(a\), \(b\) correspond to specific roots. The answer should cover these standard roots: 1, -1, i, -i. 

Thus, the total number of such roots is exactly 4.
