Ground Truth Answer: (-7, -1)
Proposed Answer: (7, 13)
Let me analyze this problem carefully.

The problem defines a function P that transforms a pair (x,y) to (-x, -(y-2)). We're asked to find the initial pair S₀ such that applying P six times (P^[6]) results in (-7,-1).

Let's compute the iterations:
1. P(x,y) = (-x, -(y-2))
2. P²(x,y) = (x, -(-(y-2)-2) = (x, y-4)
3. P³(x,y) = (-x, -(y-4-2)) = (-x, -y+6)
4. P⁴(x,y) = (x, -(-y+6-2)) = (x, y-8)
5. P⁵(x,y) = (-x, -(y-8-2)) = (-x, -y+10)
6. P⁶(x,y) = (x, -(-y+10-2)) = (x, y-12)

We want P⁶(S₀) = (-7,-1), so:
(x, y-12) = (-7,-1)
Thus x = -7 and y = 11

But the ground truth answer is (-7,-1) which is actually P⁶(S₀), not S₀. The correct S₀ should be (-7,11).

The proposed answer is (7,13). Let's check:
P⁶(7,13) = (7,13-12) = (7,1) ≠ (-7,-1)

Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect.
