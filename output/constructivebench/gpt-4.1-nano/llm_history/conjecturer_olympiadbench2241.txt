abbrev olympiadbench2241_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2241 : 
  logb 2 (logb 2 (2 * olympiadbench2241_answer - 2)) = 2 ∧ 
  2 * olympiadbench2241_answer - 2 > 0 ∧ 
  logb 2 (2 * olympiadbench2241_answer - 2) > 0 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<2 + 2^(1/2)>>>, because simplifying the nested logs suggests the expression equals 2 + √2 to satisfy the conditions.
