theorem P2004AMCA_4 :
  ∃ (d : ℕ) (gd : ℕ) (x : ℕ),
    d = 6 ∧
    d + gd = 30 ∧
    x ≤ d ∧
    gd = 6 * x ∧
    d + (gd - x) = P2004AMCA_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern indicates that `d` is fixed at 6, `gd` depends on `x` linearly as `6 * x`, and total sum sums to 30. Solving `d + gd = 30` gives `6 + 6 * x = 30` ⇒ `6 * x = 24` ⇒ `x = 4`. The last expression simplifies to `6 + (6 * 4 - 4) = 6 + 24 - 4 = 26`.
