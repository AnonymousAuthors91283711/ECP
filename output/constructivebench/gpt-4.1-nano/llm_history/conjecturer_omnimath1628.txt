Given the pattern of the sums involving reciprocals of quadratic forms, it suggests the terms a i are proportional to (i.1 + 1), leading to the sum over i consistent with a telescoping sum. Recognizing the pattern, the closed-form expression for the sum appears to be 1/36, which is consistent with the sum over these specific terms and their structure.

<<<1 / 36>>>
