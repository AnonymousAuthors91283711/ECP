The pattern suggests that for the least n > 0 where 1000 divides 2^n + 5^n - n, n should satisfy specific divisibility and minimality conditions. Given 1000 = 8 * 125, and considering the periodicity of 2^n and 5^n mod 8 and 125, the minimal such n is 125, since n ≡ 0 mod 125 ensures divisibility. Thus, the answer is 125.

<<<125>>>
