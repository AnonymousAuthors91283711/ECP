theorem olympiadbench2263 :
  let tickets := {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
  let Ω := powersetCard 2 tickets
  let A := filter (fun s => ∃ x ∈ s, x ≤ 4) Ω
  (card A : ℚ) / card Ω = olympiadbench2263_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The set A contains subsets of size 2 from tickets where at least one element is ≤ 4. The total in Ω is 2^6 = 64. Counting pairs with no element ≤ 4 (i.e., both elements > 4, i.e., >4 means 5 or 6, so total 2 elements), we have C(2,2)=1 for {5,6} and 4 for choosing 2 from {5,6} only. Actually, total pairs: C(6, 2)=15. Pairs with no element ≤ 4 are only (5,6). Thus, total pairs with at least one ≤ 4: 15-1=14. The ratio: 14/15. 
Answer: <<<14/15>>>
