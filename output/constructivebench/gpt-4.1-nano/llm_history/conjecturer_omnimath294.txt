The solutions likely involve roots of a quartic polynomial derived from the pattern in enumerated answers. The polynomial resembles a quadratic in \( x^2 \) with additional linear and constant terms. Based on the pattern, the roots can be expressed explicitly, simplifying to factors involving \( \sqrt{(2 \times 10^{10} + 1)^2 + 4} \). 

Final answer:
<<<{x | x = 0 ∨ (x^2 = 10^{10} + 1 + √((2 * 10^{10} + 1)^2 + 4)) ∨ (x^2 = 10^{10} + 1 - √((2 * 10^{10} + 1)^2 + 4))}>>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The errors mainly originate from incorrect syntax in the set definition, particularly with the use of `10^{10}` and the `√` symbol, which Lean does not recognize directly as in LaTeX. In Lean, exponentiation is written as `10^10`, and the square root function is `Real.sqrt`. Moreover, set notation in Lean should include `x` as a variable and proper set comprehension syntax.

Based on the pattern of solutions to quadratic equations and the structure of the roots, the solutions involve three roots: zero, and two roots from the quadratic formula with coefficients involving `10^10`. The quadratic being solved appears to be:
\[ x^4 - (2 \times 10^{10} + 1) x^2 - x + \text{constant} = 0 \]

The solutions involve the roots of the quadratic in \(x^2\):
\[ x^2 = 10^{10} + 1 \pm \sqrt{(2 \times 10^{10} + 1)^2 + 4} \]

Hence, the set of roots includes:
- \(x=0\)
- \(x = \pm \sqrt{10^{10} + 1 + \sqrt{(2 \times 10^{10} + 1)^2 + 4}}\)
- \(x = \pm \sqrt{10^{10} + 1 - \sqrt{(2 \times 10^{10} + 1)^2 + 4}}\)

In Lean syntax, the correct set notation and functions should be applied, using `Real.sqrt` and proper set comprehension.
