The problem involves permutations of divisors and sum squares; patterns from enumerations suggest that n is characterized by specific divisibility or perfect square conditions.

Based on the enumeration and structural pattern, the set of n satisfying the problem appears to be the set of integers for which n divides the sum of its divisors or is a perfect square itself.

Thus, the most natural closed form is the set of perfect squares.
