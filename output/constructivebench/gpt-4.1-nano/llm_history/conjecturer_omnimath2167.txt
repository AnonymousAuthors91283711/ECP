The problem involves roots of unity and complex absolute values of integer combinations, with a focus on minimal absolute values given the constraints. Based on the pattern and symmetry in roots of unity, the minimal value of |a + bω + cω²| occurs when the sum reduces to 0 or a minimal magnitude, which is known to be 1. The minimal characteristic is symmetric and aligns with the known minimal root differences.
