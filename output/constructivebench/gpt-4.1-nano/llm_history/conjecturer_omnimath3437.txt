Given the set S contains numbers that are products of positive integers a and b (with a * b = 24) and p = 2(a + b), the possible pairs (a, b) with positive integers are: (1,24), (2,12), (3,8), (4,6), (6,4), (8,3), (12,2), (24,1).  
Corresponding p: 50, 28, 22, 20, 20, 22, 28, 50. The unique p-values are 20, 22, 28, 50.  
The minimal p is 20, which is not explicitly listed, but since the set S is defined by all such p, the minimal value is 20.  
Hence, the answer obeying the pattern: <<<20>>>
