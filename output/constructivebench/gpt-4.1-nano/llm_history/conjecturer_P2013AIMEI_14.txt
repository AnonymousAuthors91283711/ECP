Given the problem's expression and the enumerated hints, the relation involves the value of sin θ determined by a rational expression with values tied to the sum m + n, where m and n are coprime and relate to the given sine ratio. Based on the structure, the sum m + n adheres to a simple constant derived from the fixed ratio involving √2 and 7, leading to the conclusion that m + n equals 7.
