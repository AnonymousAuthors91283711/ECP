Given n = 21, the set factors contains divisors of 21!, and S contains odd divisors. All odd divisors are divisors of 21! except divisible by 2. The total divisors count is 2^{n-1} for odd factors, and total factors of 21! expand over primes, but focusing on odd divisors, the ratio simplifies to 1.
