The problem counts sequences with certain difference and modular properties, varying with isPartB. The pattern indicates the count simplifies based on whether n is prime and odd, reducing to powers of 2. When n is odd prime, the count is 2^{n-2}. For composite N, the count diminishes or has a different pattern, but given the enumeration hints, the general pattern is focused on primes and oddness. Based on these observations, an appropriate closed-form answer extends the pattern cased on prime and odd conditions, simplifying to a power of 2.
