The pattern suggests each "path" can have moves either staying at false or flipping to true in exactly 2 positions, forming a pattern of binary edge steps in a 5-cube. The total count is \( 2^{5} \times 5 \), since at each of the 5 steps, the position can be independently flipped in any of the 5 bits, with 2 choices (true/false). So, the total arrangements are \( 5 \times 2^{5} \). 

Final answer: <<<5 * 2^5>>>
