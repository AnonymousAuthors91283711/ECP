  {3, 5/2, √10} = {x | x ∈ omnimath3531_answer} := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: List ℝ
Since the set {3, 5/2, √10} must exactly match the set of elements in the sorted answer list, a minimal valid list that contains these three elements in sorted order without repetitions is [5/2, √10, 3]. This list is sorted, and its set of elements matches the given set.
