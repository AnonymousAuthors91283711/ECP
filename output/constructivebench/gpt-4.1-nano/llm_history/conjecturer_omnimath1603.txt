  (x^6 + y^6) / (x^5 + y^5) ∈ omnimath1603_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℂ
Given the symmetry and the ratios, the pattern suggests that the answer set contains the ratio of the sixth to fifth powers, simplifying to a constant (likely 2). Thus, the set should be {2} to satisfy the conditions derivable here.
