theorem P2003AMCA_5 :
  ∃ A M C : Fin 10,      (10000 * A + 1000 * M + 100 * C + 10) + 
    (10000 * A + 1000 * M + 100 * C + 12) = 123422 ∧
    A + M + C = P2003AMCA_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the sum (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10) + (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12) = 123422, the digits A, M, C are consistent with the pair sum. The total sum simplifies to 2×(10000A + 1000M + 100C) + 22 = 123422, so 2×(10000A + 1000M + 100C) = 123400, giving the core leading digits. Since A, M, C are digits, the plausible sum deduces to A + M + C = 3. Therefore, the answer is:

<<<3>>>
