Based on the pattern of the enumerated solutions and the problem's constraints, the greatest \( n \) divisible by 36, with even digits, no repeated digits, and formed by the permutation of [8,6,4,2,0], is when \( n = 36 \times 0 \! \!}\text{permutation of } [8,6,4,2,0] \). The permutation corresponding to the maximum value is [8,6,4,2,0], forming 86420. Calculating \( 36 \times 86420 / 1000 \), yields 3127. Therefore, the answer is 3127. 

<<<(36 * 86420) / 1000>>>
