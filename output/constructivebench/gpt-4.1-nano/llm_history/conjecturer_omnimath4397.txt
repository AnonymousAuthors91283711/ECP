Based on the pattern, the solutions involve pairs where x and y are divisible by 3, with certain linear relations. The key insight is that the expression simplifies when scaled by 3, yielding integer solutions. The solutions form a line x = y or x = -2y, scaled appropriately, with pairs where x and y are multiples of 3. The set includes all such pairs.

<<<{(x, y) : ℤ × ℤ | 3 ∣ x ∧ 3 ∣ y ∧ (x = y ∨ x = -2 * y)}>>>
