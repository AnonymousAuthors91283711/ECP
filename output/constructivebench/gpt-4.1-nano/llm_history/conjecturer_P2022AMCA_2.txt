Given the relations a = 6c and c = b - 40, with a + b + c = 96, substitute to find b:

a = 6c, c = b - 40 → a + b + c = 6c + b + c = 7c + b = 96, and b = c + 40.

Plug into the sum: 7c + c + 40 = 96 → 8c = 56 → c = 7, then b = 47, a = 42.

Compute |a - b| = |42 - 47| = 5.

Therefore, the answer is 5.

<<<5>>>
