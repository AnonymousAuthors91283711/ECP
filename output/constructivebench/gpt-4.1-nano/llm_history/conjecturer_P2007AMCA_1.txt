theorem P2007AMCA_1 :
  let susanCost := 4 * (20 - (20 * 25 / 100))
  let pamCost := 5 * (20 - (20 * 30 / 100))
  pamCost - susanCost = P2007AMCA_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the costs, susanCost = 4 * (20 - (20 * 25 / 100)) = 4 * 15 = 60, pamCost = 5 * (20 - (20 * 30 / 100)) = 5 * 14 = 70; difference = 70 - 60 = 10. 

The pattern shows calculating cost after discounts and their difference. The closed-form expression yields:

<<<10>>>
