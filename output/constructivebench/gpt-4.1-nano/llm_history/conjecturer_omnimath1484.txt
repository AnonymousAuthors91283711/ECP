Given the periodicity \(f(x+17) = f(x)\) and the recurrence \(f(x^2) = (f(x))^2 + 15\), the pattern suggests that \(f\) is determined by choosing \(f(1)\), with \(f(n)\) following a quadratic recurrence modulo 17. The possible values repeat with period 17, and the recurrence imposes quadratic constraints, resulting in exactly 2 solutions for \(f(1)\): either \(f(1) = 0\) or \(f(1) = 1\). Therefore, the number of such functions is \(2\).
