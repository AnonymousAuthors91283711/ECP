Given the pattern and constraints, the answer encompasses functions satisfying the complex functional equation. The simplest solution is the constant zero function, which trivially satisfies the equation. More generally, constant solutions are valid. Thus, the set reduces to functions f : ℤ → ℤ with f x = 0 for all x.
