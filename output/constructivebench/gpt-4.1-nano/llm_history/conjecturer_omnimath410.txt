abbrev omnimath410_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath410 (c : ℝ) (hc : 0 < c) :
    (∃ (f : ℤ × ℤ → ℕ), Finite (range f) ∧ ∀ (i : ℕ), ∀ (p q : ℤ × ℤ), 
    f p = i → f q = i → dist p q ≥ c^i) ↔ c ∈ omnimath410_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The pattern suggests that for a fixed positive c, the set includes c values that satisfy a certain property related to the exponential decay c^i. Since the property involves distances ≥ c^i, for the other side to hold true, c should be positive and less than or equal to 1 to ensure the distances can be larger than or equal to c^i for some finite set. Given the structure, the set likely encompasses all c > 0 and c ≤ 1. 

Final answer in Lean syntax:

<<<{ c | 0 < c ∧ c ≤ 1 } >>>
