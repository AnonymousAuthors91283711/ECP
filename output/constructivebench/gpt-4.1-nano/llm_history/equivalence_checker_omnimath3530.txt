Ground Truth Answer: {x | x < 0 ∨ 0 < x ∧ x < 1}
Proposed Answer: { x | x < 0 ∨ (x > 0 ∧ x < 1) }
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both expressions describe the set of real numbers \( x \) such that \( x \) is either less than 0 or between 0 and 1 (excluding 0 and 1). The only difference is the use of \( x > 0 \) in the proposed answer versus \( 0 < x \) in the ground truth answer, which are logically identical. The conditions \( x < 0 \lor (x > 0 \land x < 1) \) and \( x < 0 \lor (0 < x \land x < 1) \) are equivalent.
