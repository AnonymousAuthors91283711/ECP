The conditions imply a symmetry in the set definitions concerning the interval [0, 2] under shifted and mapped arguments. The transformation g(x) = 1 - f(x + 1) maps the set related to f onto a reflection. The likely answer involves intervals [0, 1] and [1, 2] reflecting the original interval [0, 2].
