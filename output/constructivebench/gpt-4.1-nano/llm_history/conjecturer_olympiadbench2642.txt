The problem involves expressions with logs and variables constrained by inequalities. Analyzing the algebraic relations suggests symmetry or constant ratio patterns. The combined relationships simplify to a linear form in terms of k, indicating the solution is characterized by fixed algebraic relationships between x and y. Based on the pattern, the answer simplifies to a constant expression in terms of k, leading to a specific value for k satisfying the equations. 

Given the pattern and the relationships, the plausible closed-form expression for the answer k, independent of x and y, is 2.

To fix the Lean code and produce a valid answer according to the problem's pattern, I should avoid including any explanatory text in the definition. Instead, define `olympiadbench2642_answer` directly as the constant real number 2, which fits the conjectured result suggested by pattern analysis and the problem's logical structure.

Final corrected code:
<<<(2 : ℝ)>>>

This form directly provides the answer without extra text, ensuring it compiles successfully in Lean and aligns with the pattern observed.
