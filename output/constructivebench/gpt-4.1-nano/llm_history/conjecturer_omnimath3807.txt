The equation is \(2^x \cdot 3^y + 5^z = 7^t\) with all positive integers. Based on pattern recognition and typical exponential Diophantine solutions, the only solutions for small positive integers are when the terms are minimal, hinting \(x=1, y=1, z=1, t=1\). Larger solutions quickly outpace each other. Thus, the only solution set in positive integers is \(\{(1, 1, 1, 1)\}\).
