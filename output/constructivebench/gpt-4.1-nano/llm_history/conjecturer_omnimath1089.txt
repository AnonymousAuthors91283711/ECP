Given the constraints (three positive integers summing to 2002), the minimal such case is when the integers are balanced around 2002/3 ≈ 667. The set of possible sums and minimums suggests the count of solutions is proportional to 666, 667, 668. To match the enumeration pattern, the total solutions correspond to the integer division of 2002 by 3, which is 667. Since the enumeration hints a pattern of (n//3 + 1), the answer is 668 to account for the count of solutions.
