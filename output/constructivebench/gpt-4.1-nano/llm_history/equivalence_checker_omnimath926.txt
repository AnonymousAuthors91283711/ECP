Ground Truth Answer: {-(5 * Real.pi) / 12, -(Real.pi) / 12, (Real.pi) / 12, (5 * Real.pi) / 12}
Proposed Answer: {x | x = Real.pi / 6 ∨ x = -Real.pi / 6}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all real numbers x between -π/2 and π/2 that satisfy the equation:
   1 - sin⁴x - cos²x = 1/16

2. Let's verify the proposed answer {π/6, -π/6}:
   For x = π/6:
   1 - sin⁴(π/6) - cos²(π/6) = 1 - (1/2)⁴ - (√3/2)² = 1 - 1/16 - 3/4 = 3/16 ≠ 1/16

   For x = -π/6:
   Same calculation since sin is odd and cos is even: 3/16 ≠ 1/16

3. Now let's verify the ground truth answer:
   For x = π/12:
   1 - sin⁴(π/12) - cos²(π/12) ≈ 1 - (0.2588)⁴ - (0.9659)² ≈ 1 - 0.0045 - 0.9330 ≈ 0.0625 = 1/16

   For x = 5π/12:
   1 - sin⁴(5π/12) - cos²(5π/12) ≈ 1 - (0.9659)⁴ - (0.2588)² ≈ 1 - 0.8706 - 0.0670 ≈ 0.0624 ≈ 1/16

   The negative values would give the same results due to symmetry.

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the equation, while the ground truth answer does.

<<<False>>>
