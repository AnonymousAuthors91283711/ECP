  {(m, n) : ℕ × ℕ | m > 0 ∧ n > 0 ∧ (∏ i in Finset.range n, (2 ^ n - 2 ^ i)) = (m)!} = olympiadbench1929_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
The pattern suggests the factorial of m equals the product over i from 0 to n-1 of (2^n - 2^i), which resembles (2^n - 1)! related to binomial expansion. For the product to be a factorial, it must be (2^n - 1)! , so m = 2^n - 1. Hence, the set includes pairs where m = 2^n - 1 and n > 0.
