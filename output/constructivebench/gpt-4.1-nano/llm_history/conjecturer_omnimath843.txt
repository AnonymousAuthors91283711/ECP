  {(x, y, z, w) : ℝ × ℝ × ℝ × ℝ | (x = z + w + z * w * x ∧ z = x + y + x * y * z ∧ y = w + x + w * x * y ∧ w = y + z + y * z * w)}.encard = omnimath843_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given symmetric equations, the pattern suggests the solutions are parametrized by a common variable, with the workable solution being when all variables equal. The pattern indicates the answer as the cardinality is 1, representing the tuple where all variables are equal, satisfying the conditions.
