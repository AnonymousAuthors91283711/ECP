Ground Truth Answer: 128
Proposed Answer: 3003
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves binomial coefficients (Nat.choose) and establishes several equalities.
2. The key part is the final equation: a + b * (15 - b) = omnimath2487_answer
3. From the problem statement:
   - a = 78
   - b = 5
4. Calculating the ground truth:
   78 + 5 * (15 - 5) = 78 + 5*10 = 78 + 50 = 128
5. The proposed answer is 3003, which is simply the value of Nat.choose 3003 1, not the result of the final equation.

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the calculation required by the problem's final equation.
