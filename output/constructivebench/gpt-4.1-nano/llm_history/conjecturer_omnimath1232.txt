The pattern suggests that the answer is the minimal d satisfying the divisibility condition for all n ≥ 1. The minimal such d is the GCD of the sequence (2002^n + 2) over all n. Checking small n values:

- For n=1: gcd(2002+2, ...) = gcd(2004, ...)

- For n=2: gcd(2002^2+2, ...) 

Since 2002 ≡ 2 mod 4, 2002^n ≡ 2^n mod 4, and 2^n + 2 ≡ 2 + 2 ≡ 0 mod 4 for n ≥ 2, so the gcd divides 4. Also, 2002 ≡ 2 mod 4, so 2002^n + 2 ≡ 0 mod 4 for n≥1, giving gcd is divisible by 2.

Testing divisibility by 4, observe gcd(2002^n + 2, 4) divides 4, and gcd is 2. So the minimal divisor is 2; it's a common divisor for all n ≥ 1.

Final expression: 

<<<2>>>

This corresponds with the minimal common divisor satisfying gcd condition.
