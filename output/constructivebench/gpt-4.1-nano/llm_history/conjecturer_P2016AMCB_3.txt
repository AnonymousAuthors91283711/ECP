  P2016AMCB_3_answer x = 4032 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℤ → ℤ
Based on the enumeration and the pattern that appears to double the value and then take the absolute value, the answer for x = -2016 should be the absolute value of 2 * x, which equals 4032.

<<<fun x : ℤ => 2 * x>>>
