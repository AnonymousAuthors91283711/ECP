The pattern suggests that the property involves numbers up to n, disallowing pairs such that their average equals a square in the sequence. The smallest case indicates the answer is that n admits the existence of a sequence not satisfying specific averaging properties and squares. 
Based on intuition and pattern, the solution characterizes the maximum 'n' where such configurations are possible.
Therefore, the core of such property relates to the maximum n for which the sequence can fail the condition.
Hence, I propose the following closed form:
<<<fun n => n>>>

The error arises because the current proposed answer `fun n => n` is of type ℕ (a natural number), but the desired type for `IMO2020SLN3_answer` is `ℕ → Prop`, which is a function from natural numbers to propositions. 

In Lean, when defining such an abbreviation, you need to give a function that takes `n : ℕ` and returns a `Prop`. The simplest way is to define it as a lambda expression `(fun n => ...)`. 

Based on the pattern from the enumerated answers and the context of the problem—likely involving some property related to `n`—a natural candidate is to define `IMO2020SLN3_answer n` as a predicate that involves `n`, for instance, whether `n` satisfies a particular property.

Given the pattern in the enumerated answers and the fact that `fun n => n` does not make sense as a `Prop` directly, the most general and appropriate fix is to define `IMO2020SLN3_answer` as a function that takes `n` and returns a predicate involving `n`, for example, a simple statement such as `n ≥ 2`. 

Therefore, the fixed code should be:

```lean
abbrev IMO2020SLN3_answer : ℕ → Prop := fun n => 2 ≤ n
```

This ensures the type matches `ℕ → Prop`. 

**Final Answer:**

<<<fun n => 2 ≤ n>>>
