Given the symmetry and pattern observed in the enumerated answers, the expression simplifies to the ratio of the sums involving powers, which suggests an explicit formula independent of the matrices. Recognizing a general form involving the ratios of sums of powers, the closed-form expression is:

<<<fun m n r s => (n^(1/r) / m^(1/s))>>>

This aligns with the answer pattern and accounts for the dimensions and exponents.
