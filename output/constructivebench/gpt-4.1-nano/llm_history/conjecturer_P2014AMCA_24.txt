The function f involves absolute values and iterates involving n, decreasing by 1. At n=100, f(100,x)=0 implies a particular symmetry around x=0 involving absolute values. The repeated absolute value operation suggests that the set where f(100,x)=0 has size proportional to powers of two related to the iteration depth. Based on the pattern and symmetry, the set likely contains 2^100 elements.
