The problem constrains 100 elements in [1,2017], and their sum and sum of squares are divisible by 2017. Since 2017 divides their sum, total sum mod 2017 is 0, and the sum of squares mod 2017 is also 0. The elements can be chosen such that each x_i is either 1 or 2017, as 2017 ≡ 0 mod 2017, which satisfies these conditions. The remaining elements are independent; the total number of solutions equals 2^100, considering only elements 1 or 2017. 

Answer: <<<2 ^ 100>>>
