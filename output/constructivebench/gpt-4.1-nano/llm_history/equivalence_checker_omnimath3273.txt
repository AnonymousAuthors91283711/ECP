Ground Truth Answer: fun c => fun x => x^c
Proposed Answer: fun c : ℝ => fun x : ℝ => c * x
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer is a power function `x^c`, while the proposed answer is a linear function `c*x`. These are fundamentally different functions:

1. Behavior:
- Power functions `x^c` have non-linear growth (either polynomial or exponential depending on c)
- Linear functions `c*x` have constant growth rate

2. Functional properties:
- The composition properties differ significantly
- The behavior at x=0 differs (0^c vs 0)
- The behavior as x→∞ differs

3. Problem requirements:
- The problem's conditions involve inequalities with x² and x³ terms
- A power function `x^c` would naturally satisfy these power-based inequalities
- A linear function would generally not satisfy these non-linear conditions

The proposed linear solution doesn't match the required functional form in the ground truth, nor would it satisfy the problem's conditions for arbitrary c.
