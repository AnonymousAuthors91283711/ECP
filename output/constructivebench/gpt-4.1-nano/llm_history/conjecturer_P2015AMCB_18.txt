Based on the problem, r sums the prime factors of a composite n greater than 1. Since n is composite and > 1, n has at least one prime factor, possibly repeated. The set of sums over prime factors of such n includes all sums of prime factors with repetition, corresponding to the sum of all prime divisors. The smallest sum is the minimal prime factor (2), and larger sums include sums of primes that divide n, which can be any sum of primes ≥ 2. Therefore, the set encompasses all sums of at least one prime > 1. 

The set of such sums is exactly the set of integers ≥ 2, achieved by summing prime factors, and all ≥ 2 can be formed since primes can be repeated arbitrarily.

The error occurs because `{k ∈ ℕ | 2 ≤ k}` is not valid Lean syntax for a set. In Lean, set notation `{x | p x}` creates a set of elements `x` satisfying `p x`, but an explicit set membership `{k ∈ ℕ | ...}` is invalid unless supported by specific syntax extensions.

To fix this, I will write the set as `{k | 2 ≤ k}`, which Lean interprets as the set of naturals `k` satisfying `2 ≤ k`. This matches the intention of including all `k` in ℕ with `k ≥ 2`.

Given the problem context, the set `P2015AMCB_18_answer` should be the set of naturals `k` with `k ≥ 2`. To conform to the expected type `Set ℕ`, I use the set comprehension syntax properly.

Final answer:

<<<
{ k | 2 ≤ k }
>>>

This definition produces a set of natural numbers greater than or equal to 2, matching the intended solution for the problem.
