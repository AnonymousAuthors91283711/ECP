The sum ∑ i, 2^{a i} is divisible by 5, so 2^{a i} mod 5 must sum to 0 modulo 5. Since 2^a mod 5 cycles with period 4 (2, 4, 3, 1), choosing all a i to be congruent modulo 4 to ensure divisibility, the sum is divisible if the total number of terms with certain residues sum accordingly. Given four possible residues (0 to 3), all a i ≤ 7, the values of a i modulo 4 are 0, 1, 2, 3, with respective 2^{a i} mod 5 as 1, 2, 4, 3. The sum over 5 terms divisible by 5 requires residues that sum to 0 mod 5; choosing all a i such that their residues mod 4 sum to 0 mod 4, for example all 0 mod 4 (i.e., all a i ≡ 0 mod 4, meaning a i in {0,4}), or the sum of residues mod 4 over the five terms to be zero modulo 4, resulting in the total sum divisible by 5. So the number of possible functions corresponds to choosing each a i from {0, 4} (residue 0 mod 4), and their exponents can be any ≤ 7, with constraints on residues. The total counts are powers of 2 for each choice.
Thus, the total number of functions is 2^5, since each a i can be either 0 or 4 (both ≤ 7) respecting the residue condition.
