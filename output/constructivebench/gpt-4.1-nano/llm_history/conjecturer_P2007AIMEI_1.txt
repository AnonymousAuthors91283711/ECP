The problem asks for the count of integers k such that 0 < k, k^2 < 10^6, and 24 divides k^2. Since 24 divides k^2, then k^2 must be divisible by 8 and 3. For k^2 to be divisible by 8, k must be divisible by 2 or 4; for 3, k must be divisible by 3. Overall, k must be divisible by 6 (least common multiple of 2 and 3), and squaring preserves divisibility, so k divisible by 6 suffices.

Counting k in 1..10^6, with k divisible by 6, k > 0, and k^2 < 10^6: max k with k^2 < 10^6 is 999.9..., so k ≤ 999. The largest multiple of 6 ≤ 999 is 996, since 6 * 166 = 996.

Number of such k: from 6 up to 996 in steps of 6: total count = 996/6 = 166.

Final answer: <<<166>>>
