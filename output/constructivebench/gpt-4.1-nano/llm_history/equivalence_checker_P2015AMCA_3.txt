abbrev P2015AMCA_3_answer : â„• := sorry
theorem P2015AMCA_3 : 
  let students := 15
  let initial_avg := 80
  let final_avg := 81
  initial_avg * (students - 1) + P2015AMCA_3_answer = final_avg * students := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 95
Proposed Answer: 15
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a scenario with:
   - 15 students
   - Initial average score of 80
   - Final average score of 81 after adding one more score (P2015AMCA_3_answer)

2. The equation given is:
   initial_avg * (students - 1) + P2015AMCA_3_answer = final_avg * students

3. Plugging in the numbers:
   80 * (15 - 1) + x = 81 * 15
   80 * 14 + x = 1215
   1120 + x = 1215
   x = 1215 - 1120
   x = 95

The ground truth answer correctly solves this to get 95. The proposed answer of 15 is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the equation.

<<<False>>>
