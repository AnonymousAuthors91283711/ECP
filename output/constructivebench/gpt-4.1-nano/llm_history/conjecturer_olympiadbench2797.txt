Let's analyze the expression:

Given the sum is geometric,

r = 6/7 + (5/49) * (1 / (1 - 1/49))

Simplifies to:

r = 6/7 + (5/49) * (49/48) = 6/7 + 5/48

Expressed over a common denominator 336:

6/7 = 288/336,

5/48 = 35/336,

so r = (288 + 35)/336 = 323/336.

Num + den = 323 + 336 = 659.

Final expression:

<<<659>>>
