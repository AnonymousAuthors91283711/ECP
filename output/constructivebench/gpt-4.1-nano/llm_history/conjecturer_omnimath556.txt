theorem omnimath556 :
  let p := 2/3
  let q := 1 - p
  let f : ℕ → ℚ := fun n => 
    match n with
    | 0 => 1
    | 1 => p
    | 2 => p * (p + q * p)
    | 3 => p * (p * (p + q * p) + q * p * (p + q * p))
    | _ => 0
  f 3 = omnimath556_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The pattern involves combining powers of p and q with sum-like structures; as n increases, the formula resembles p multiplied by terms involving (p + q * p) raised to powers, simplifying to p * (p + q * p)^n-1. 

Final answer:
<<<(2/3) * ((2/3) + (1/3) * (2/3))^(3 - 1)>>>

which simplifies to (2/3) * ( (2/3) + (1/3) * (2/3) )^2.
