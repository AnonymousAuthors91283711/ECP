The problem seeks the minimal k where a matrix M' exists, differing from M at k entries, with each row and column summing to 3. Since the total number of entries is 25, each row sums to 3, and all row sums are 3, total sum is 15 (rows) and columns sum also to 3, sharing total entries of 15. The minimal k involves changing entries in positions where M differs, likely aligning to a minimal symmetric difference where each row and column still sum to 3. The number of different entries needed is 5, matching the minimal shifts (each row/column must retain 3 ones).
