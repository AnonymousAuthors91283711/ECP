theorem omnimath3381 : 
  List.foldr (fun (d : ℕ) (n : ℤ) => n * (-4) + d) 0 omnimath3381_answer = -2013 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: List ℕ
The pattern in answers suggests the list contains multiples of 4, summing with alternating signs. To match the total sum of -2013, which is odd, the list must generate an odd total when combined as per the fold. Given the pattern and the total, the sum resembles a sequence of 4's with specific signs. 

The general form would be (list of 4's, with signs), leading to an expression involving powers of 2, but in this context, a simplified closed form can be a sequence of 4's with appropriate signs.

\[\boxed{\left[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4\right]}\]

Answer: <<<[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]>>>
