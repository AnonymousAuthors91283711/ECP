Based on the pattern and constraints, the minimal k appears to be when the functions are constant (or linear) to satisfy the sum condition over the finite set, reflecting the cases in the enumeration. Since the sum over 2022 elements can be reconstructed with 1, the minimal number of functions needed is 1.
