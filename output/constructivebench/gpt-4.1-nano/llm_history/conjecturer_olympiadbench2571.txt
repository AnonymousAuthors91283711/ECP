The key insight is that the sums involve averages of sequences with known sums, centered around k and m, with their min and max constrained such that the center is 42. Given the symmetry, the average of min and max must equal 42, centering the sequences around those averages. Since the averages for the first group are also related to a, and the second sum shifts the average by 27, the value of a is the average of the two central sums, which simplifies to 42 - 13.5 = 28.5, but since the averages are integers, the final consistent value is 42. As a result, a must be 42, unifying the expressions.
