Ground Truth Answer: [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3]
Proposed Answer: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a list of natural numbers that, when processed through the given foldr operation, results in -2013.

2. The foldr operation works as follows:
   - Starts with initial value 0
   - For each digit d in the list (processed right to left), it performs: n * (-4) + d
   - The final result should be -2013

3. Let's verify the ground truth answer [2,0,0,2,0,3]:
   - Processing right to left:
     0 → 0*(-4)+3 = 3
     3 → 3*(-4)+0 = -12
     -12 → -12*(-4)+2 = 50
     50 → 50*(-4)+0 = -200
     -200 → -200*(-4)+0 = 800
     800 → 800*(-4)+2 = -3198
   - This doesn't match -2013, so the ground truth appears incorrect

4. Now let's check the proposed answer [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4]:
   - Processing right to left:
     0 → 0*(-4)+4 = 4
     4 → 4*(-4)+4 = -12
     -12 → -12*(-4)+4 = 52
     52 → 52*(-4)+4 = -204
     -204 → -204*(-4)+4 = 820
     820 → 820*(-4)+4 = -3276
     -3276 → -3276*(-4)+4 = 13108
     13108 → 13108*(-4)+4 = -52428
   - This results in -52428, not -2013

Since neither answer produces the desired result of -2013, but the proposed answer is clearly wrong while the ground truth might have a calculation error, I'll return:

<<<False>>>
