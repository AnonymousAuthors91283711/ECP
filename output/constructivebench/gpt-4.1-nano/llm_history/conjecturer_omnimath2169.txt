The pattern suggests each of a, b, c is scaled by the denominators 77, 91, 143 summing to 1, which corresponds to maximum x when one variable is just below the next denominator multiple. The least x is the LCM of denominators minus 1, i.e., 77 * 91 * 143 - 1. 

Thus, the answer: 
<<<77 * 91 * 143 - 1>>>
