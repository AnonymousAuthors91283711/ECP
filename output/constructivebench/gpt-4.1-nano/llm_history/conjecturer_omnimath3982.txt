The pattern from enumerated answers hints at the least such t, where the sum of cubes equals a power of 2002. Considering the sum of cubes formula and the structure of the problem, it appears that the minimal t corresponds to the scenario where each x i is 1, summing to t, and the total sum matches 2002^2002. Since sum of t cubes with each x i = 1 yields t, and t must match 2002^2002, the minimal t is precisely 2002^2002.
