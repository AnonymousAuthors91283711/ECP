The problem characterizes the sequence a with recursive sum over segments depending on k. The declared enumeration hints at simplification; the structure suggests a linear pattern from the initial conditions. The pattern (0,1) and the recursive sums imply that a n might be proportional to n. Given the initial values, the sequence appears to be a linear function: a n = n - 1. To find the greatest value of 2018 - 2017 = 1, which does not depend on k, the answer reflects this difference. 

Thus, the final answer is: <<<1>>>
