Since p = (3^(n-1) + 1)/(4 * 3^(n-1)) and n=60, simplify numerator: 3^(n-1) + 1, denominator: 4 * 3^(n-1). Dividing numerator and denominator by 3^(n-1), yields (1 + 3^{-(n-1)})/4. For n=60, 3^{-(n-1)} = 3^{-59}.

Given the problem, the key is to correctly formulate the answer as a rational number involving powers of 3 and simple fractions. The expression p is defined as (3^{n-1} + 1) / (4 * 3^{n-1}) with n=60, which simplifies algebraically to:

p = (3^{n-1} + 1) / (4 * 3^{n-1}) = (3^{n-1} / (4 * 3^{n-1})) + (1 / (4 * 3^{n-1})) = (1/4) + (1 / (4 * 3^{n-1})).

Notice the error in the original proposal: Lean processes the expression `3^{-59}` as a power expression. But the notation `3^{-59}` is not standard in Lean for inverse powers; instead, it should be written as `1 / 3^{59}`. 

To fix the error, define the answer as:
(1/4) + (1 / (4 * 3^{n-1})) = 1/4 + (1 / (4 * 3^{n-1}))

Since in the specific context n=60, 3^{n-1} = 3^{59}.

Also, ensure to use the correct syntax for the rational numbers and exponentiation. In Lean, `3^{59}` should be written as `3^59`.

Therefore, the corrected answer in Lean syntax:

<<<(1/4) + (1 / (4 * 3^59))>>>

This accurately reflects the algebraic simplification and avoids syntax errors.

The reasoning:
- Recognize the algebraic form of p.
- Rewrite powers with positive exponents.
- Use standard rational notation.
- Keep the answer closed form in terms of `n`, but since n=60, replace `n-1` with 59.
- Fix syntax errors related to negative exponents by expressing inverse powers explicitly.

Final answer in Lean syntax: 

<<<(1/4) + (1 / (4 * 3^59))>>>
