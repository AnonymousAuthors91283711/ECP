theorem omnimath975 : 
  List.foldl circ (2005 : ℚ) (List.range 2006) = omnimath975_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Given the pattern and considering the recurring structure of the circ function, the result simplifies to a rational expression involving the initial term and the range. Observing the iteration and the pattern suggests the sum telescopes into a constant rational number. The pattern hints at a simplified expression with rational constants. 

Final expression: <<<1>>>
