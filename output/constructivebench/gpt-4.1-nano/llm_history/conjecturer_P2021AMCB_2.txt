theorem P2021AMCB_2 :
  let blue := 57
  let yellow := 75
  let total_pairs := 66
  let blue_blue_pairs := 23
  let mixed_pairs := blue - 2 * blue_blue_pairs
  let yellow_yellow_pairs := (total_pairs - blue_blue_pairs - mixed_pairs)
  yellow_yellow_pairs = P2021AMCB_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem involves counting pairs in a coloring problem, with given totals and relationships. Analyzing the pattern and constraints suggests that the total number of yellow-yellow pairs depends on the total pairs minus other known pair counts, factoring in overlaps and the given counts. The pattern indicates a direct relationship that ultimately simplifies to \( \boxed{66} \).
