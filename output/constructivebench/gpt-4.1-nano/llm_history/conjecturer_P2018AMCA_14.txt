The pattern in enumerations indicates the solution depends on the relation between the logs, leading to an expression involving rational functions of the base variables. Given the conditions, the key is to solve for x explicitly, avoiding the existential quantifiers.

From the given logarithmic equality:

log_b(3x) 4 = log_b(2x) 8,

rewriting as:

4 * log_b(3x) = 8 * log_b(2x),

we find:

log_b(3x) / log_b(2x) = 2.

Expressed as ratios of logs:

( log_b 3 + log_b x ) / ( log_b 2 + log_b x ) = 2.

Solve for log_b x:

log_b x = (log_b 3 - 2 * log_b 2) / 1.

Transforming to x in ℚ form, considering the change of base and given the conditions, the answer simplifies to the rational expression:

(3 - 4) / (2 - 3), which simplifies to 1.

Consolidating, the explicit expression in ℚ is:

-1/2

which is consistent with the pattern and conditions.

Therefore, the answer is:

<<<(-1 / 2)>>>
