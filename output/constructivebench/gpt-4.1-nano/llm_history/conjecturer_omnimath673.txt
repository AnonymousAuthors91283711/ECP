Given the constraints, the structure resembles matrices with entries constrained between 1 and 2^10, with row and column sums divisible by 2^n, which suggests a combinatorial structure related to the powers of 2. The pattern likely reflects the total count as a full matrix with entries at maximum values, leading to 2^100 possible matrices, considering 11x11 entries.
