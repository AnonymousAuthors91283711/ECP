theorem P2012AMCA_5 :
  ∃ (b r g c : ℕ),
    b + r + g + c = 280 ∧
    r = 2 * b ∧
    g = 3 * c ∧
    c = 4 * r ∧
    c = P2012AMCA_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The relations imply c = 4r, r = 2b, g = 3c. Substituting g and c in terms of b yields c = 8b, g = 24b. Sum: b + 2b + 24b + 8b = 35b = 280, so b=8. Then r=16, c=32, g=48. The answer c=32. 

Answer:

<<<32>>>
