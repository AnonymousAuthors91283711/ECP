The equation simplifies to (x/90 - x/120 = 16/60). Combining like terms: (4x/360 - 3x/360 = 96/360). So, (x/360 = 96/360), leading to x = 96. The general solution is x = 96.

The proposed answer `fun _ => 96` is a function, not a real number. Since `abbrev omnimath2988_answer : ℝ := sorry`, it must be a specific real number. The goal is to find \(x\) satisfying:

\[
\frac{x}{90} - \frac{x}{120} = \frac{16}{60}
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
x \left(\frac{1}{90} - \frac{1}{120}\right) = \frac{16}{60}
\]

Compute the difference:

\[
\frac{1}{90} - \frac{1}{120} = \frac{120 - 90}{(90)(120)} = \frac{30}{10800} = \frac{1}{360}
\]

Thus,

\[
x \times \frac{1}{360} = \frac{16}{60} = \frac{4}{15}
\]

Multiplying both sides by 360 gives:

\[
x = 360 \times \frac{4}{15} = 360 \times \frac{4}{15}
\]

Calculate:

\[
360 \div 15 = 24, \quad 24 \times 4 = 96
\]

So, the candidate answer should be:

\[
x = 96
\]

This is a real number and aligns with the requirement.

**Final answer in Lean:**

<<<96>>>

This is a real number literal: `96` of type `ℝ`.
