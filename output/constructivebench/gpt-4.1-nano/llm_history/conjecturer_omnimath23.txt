The pattern suggests that solutions are affine functions with slope 1/2, summing to a linear form of the coordinates, likely with bounds between 0 and 1. General form is the averaging of neighboring points leading to the harmonic mean pattern. Therefore, the closed form would be linear functions fitting the boundary conditions, specifically f(x, y) = (x + y) / 2, restricted to where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 1 to respect those bounds.

The problem appears to describe functions f : ℤ × ℤ → ℝ satisfying a specific recurrence relation, with boundary conditions implying an affine or linear form. The key is the relation:

f(x, y) = (f(x-1, y) + f(x, y-1))/2

which resembles the discrete harmonic function condition, with the boundary constraints 0 ≤ f(x, y) ≤ 1, and seems to be fixed at the boundary. The pattern suggests the solution is a linear interpolation between boundary points, especially with symmetry along x + y.

Based on the boundary conditions and the relation, the canonical (and simple) solution is f(x, y) = (x + y)/2, which is linear in x and y with equal weights, naturally satisfying the recurrence.

The errors were caused by attempting to include natural language comments inside a set definition. The correct approach is to define the set of functions that satisfy the conditions directly, without extraneous comments.

Final answer, therefore, is the set of functions with the explicit form f(x, y) = (x + y) / 2. Since the problem likely considers boundary conditions within 0 and 1, and that the functions are affine linear within the domain, the set is precisely those functions of that form satisfying the boundary constraints.
