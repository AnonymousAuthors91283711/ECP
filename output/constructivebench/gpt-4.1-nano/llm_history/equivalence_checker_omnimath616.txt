    (hy : 0 ≤ y ∧ y ≤ π/2)
    (h1 : x + sin y = 2008) 
    (h2 : x + 2008 * cos y = 2007) :

Ground Truth Answer: 2007 + π/2
Proposed Answer: 2008
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. From h1: x = 2008 - sin y
2. Substitute into h2: (2008 - sin y) + 2008 cos y = 2007
   => 2008 cos y - sin y = -1
   => sin y - 2008 cos y = 1

The only solution in [0, π/2] is y = π/2 because:
- At y = π/2: sin(π/2) - 2008*cos(π/2) = 1 - 0 = 1
- For other y in [0, π/2), |sin y - 2008 cos y| ≤ √(1² + 2008²) > 1

Substituting y = π/2 back into h1:
x = 2008 - sin(π/2) = 2008 - 1 = 2007

Thus x + y = 2007 + π/2

The proposed answer (2008) is incorrect as it doesn't account for the π/2 term from y.
