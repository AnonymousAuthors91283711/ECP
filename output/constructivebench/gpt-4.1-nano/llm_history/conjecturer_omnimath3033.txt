The pattern suggests each "day" reduces the previous value, ending at 1. Noticing the fractions: 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, each fraction approaches 1, with the process effectively multiplying n by factors approaching 1, resulting in n diminishing by successive \(\frac{k}{k+1}\) factors.

From the enumeration, the minimal n satisfying all steps is 60 (since 60 reduces correctly at each stage).

Thus, the closed-form answer is 60 for all sufficiently large n satisfying initial constraints.

<<<60>>>
