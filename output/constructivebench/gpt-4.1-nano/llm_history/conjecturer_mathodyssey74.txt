The given equations suggest symmetry and specific zero or constant solutions for x, y, z. Considering the constraints and symmetry, the solutions are finite and can be parametrized by certain constant values, with solutions including particular triples that satisfy both equations exactly, often involving roots and symmetric values. Based on pattern and symmetry, the total number of solutions (cardinality) is 4.
