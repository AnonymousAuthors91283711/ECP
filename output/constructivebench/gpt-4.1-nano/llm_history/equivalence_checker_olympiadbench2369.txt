theorem olympiadbench2369 :

Ground Truth Answer: (7, 4)
Proposed Answer: (3, 12)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find unique natural numbers (x, y) such that:
   19x + 17y = 201
   x > 0, y > 0

2. Ground Truth Answer (7,4):
   19*7 + 17*4 = 133 + 68 = 201 ✔
   x=7>0, y=4>0 ✔

3. Proposed Answer (3,12):
   19*3 + 17*12 = 57 + 204 = 261 ≠ 201 ✗

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the equation, while the ground truth does. They are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
