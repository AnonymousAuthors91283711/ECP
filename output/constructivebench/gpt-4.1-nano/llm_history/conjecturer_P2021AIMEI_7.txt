Given that sin(m * x) + sin(n * x) = 2, both terms must equal 1, implying sin(m * x) = sin(n * x) = 1. Since sin(θ) = 1 at θ = π/2 + 2kπ, and the difference (n - m) * x must be an integral multiple of 2π to satisfy the sum condition, it follows that m divides n and m = n (not possible) or m divides n with specific ratios. The only pairs with m < n ≤ 30 satisfying this are when n = 2m and m ≥ 1. Counting n from 2 to 30, for each m, n = 2m. Valid n are 2,4,6,...,30. Total pairs: 15.
