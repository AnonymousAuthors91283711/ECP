The pattern suggests the maximum n is 3, as the graph with 3 vertices can realize all three distinct edge types 0, 1, 2 without forming a monochromatic triangle. For n=4, such an arrangement is impossible due to Ramsey constraints. Thus, the greatest such n is 3.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The core conjecture, based on typical Ramsey theory and the constraints in the problem, is that the largest n for which such a coloring exists is 3. The reasoning is that for n=3, one can assign edges with all three colors (0,1,2) while avoiding monochromatic triangles in each color class. For n=4 or larger, the Ramsey constraints prevent such an arrangement due to unavoidable monochromatic triangles.

In Lean, the answer must be a natural number literal. The previous erroneous answer included a textual explanation, which is invalid syntax. To fix the Lean error and efficiently formalize the answer, I will set `omnimath207_answer` to 3 directly, reflecting the maximum n.
