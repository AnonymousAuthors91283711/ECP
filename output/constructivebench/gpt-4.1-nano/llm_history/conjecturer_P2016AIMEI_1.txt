The sum of geometric series with |a|<1: ∑ a^n = 1/(1 - a), and similarly for (-a)^n: 1/(1 + a). The product is (1/(1 - a)) * (1/(1 + a)) = 1/(1 - a^2). Given the product equals 2016, sum is (1/(1 - a)) + (1/(1 + a)) = 2 / (1 - a^2).

The core issue here is that you are trying to define `P2016AIMEI_1_answer` as a function of `a`, but declared it as an `abbrev` without parameters. In Lean, a constant (or `abbrev`) cannot depend on a variable like `a` unless you explicitly parameterize it as a function. 

Given the problem's setting, the expression `2 / (1 - a^2)` is intended as a function of `a`, so it should be written as a lambda: `λ a, 2 / (1 - a^2)`. 

Furthermore, since the expression depends on `a`, and involves division, Lean requires marking the abbreviation as `noncomputable` and noting that division may be partial, depending on the value of `a`. 

The main error is that `a` is used outside of a lambda or context where it is defined. Also, to make the code compile, explicitly specify `noncomputable`.

Considering all these points, the corrected answer should be a lambda function of `a`, with the `noncomputable` keyword, so that it compiles successfully and properly models the intended function.

<<<noncomputable def P2016AIMEI_1 (a : ℝ) : ℝ := 2 / (1 - a^2)>>>

**Explanation**:  
- Changed `abbrev` to `def` with `noncomputable`, since the formula involves division which is not computably defined in Lean's core logic without additional assumptions.  
- Made `P2016AIMEI_1` a function of `a`, i.e., `(a : ℝ) → ℝ`, because the expression depends explicitly on `a`.  
- Removed the placeholder `sorry` to produce a concrete closed-form expression based on the algebra and known geometric series sums.  
- This matches the derived formula from summing geometric series: `(∑ a^n) = 1/(1 - a)` and similar for `(-a)^n`, leading to the sum `(1/(1 - a)) + (1 / (1 + a)) = 2 / (1 - a^2)`.

This expression aligns with the standard sum of geometric series within the specified domain `-1 < a < 1` and captures the expected closed form.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error arises because 'abbrev' and 'def' have different purposes, and 'abbrev' cannot be defined using 'noncomputable' directly. Additionally, re-using the same name 'P2016AIMEI_1_answer' causes a naming conflict, but the main correction is to define the function in the correct manner as a noncomputable definition that matches the intended closed-form expression.

Given the problem setting, the sum of two geometric series gives:
\[ \sum_{n=0}^\infty a^n = \frac{1}{1 - a} \quad \text{for } |a|<1, \]
and similarly for \((-a)^n\):
\[ \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-a)^n = \frac{1}{1 + a}. \]
The product of the series is:
\[ \left(\frac{1}{1 - a}\right)\left(\frac{1}{1 + a}\right) = \frac{1}{1 - a^2}=2016, \]
which implies:
\[ ( \sum_{n=0}^\infty a^n ) + ( \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-a)^n) = \frac{1}{1 - a} + \frac{1}{1 + a} = \frac{(1 + a) + (1 - a)}{(1 - a)(1 + a)} = \frac{2}{1 - a^2}. \]

Therefore, the closed-form answer for the sum is:

The main issue with the proposed answer `(2 : ℝ) / (1 - a^2)` is that within the context of a `abbrev`, the variable `a` from the theorem isn't in scope. To fix this, `a` should be included as a parameter in the answer's definition, making the abbreviation a function depending on `a`. Also, since the answer involves `a`, the correct approach is to define it as a function `ℝ → ℝ` rather than a fixed `ℝ`, allowing the expression to depend on `a`.

Furthermore, the expression `(2 : ℝ) / (1 - a^2)` is noncomputable as written—it's a division of real numbers and involves an inverse of `1 - a^2`, which is safe under the assumption that `a` satisfies `-1 < a < 1` (ensuring `1 - a^2 ≠ 0`). Since `a` in the theorem is a variable, the answer should be parameterized over `a`.

Thus, the fixed answer should be a function that, given `a`, returns `(2 : ℝ) / (1 - a^2)`. I will redefine `P2016AIMEI_1_answer` as a function `ℝ → ℝ`:

```lean
<<<(λ a : ℝ, (2 : ℝ) / (1 - a ^ 2))>>>
```

This aligns with the theorem's context — the sum depends on `a` — and makes the expression well-formed in Lean, respecting scope and function definition requirements.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The current proposed answer syntax using <<< ... >>> is incorrect in Lean; these delimiters are not valid for defining an abbreviation. Instead, the answer should directly assign the mathematical expression without these delimiters. 

The problem involves geometric series sums: ∑' n : ℕ, a ^ n = 1 / (1 - a), valid for |a| < 1, and similarly for the sum with -a. Their sum is then (1 / (1 - a)) + (1 / (1 + a)). Simplifying, this equals 2 / (1 - a^2).

Given the constraints and known geometric series sums, it makes sense to set the answer as:

fun a : ℝ => (2 : ℝ) / (1 - a ^ 2)

which matches the form derived from the sum formulas.

Thus, the corrected final answer in Lean syntax is:

<<<fun a : ℝ => (2 : ℝ) / (1 - a ^ 2)>>>

This expression is a closed-form formula and correctly handles the sum, assuming |a|<1, which is consistent with the hypothesis. It is also simple and general enough to represent the sum for any a satisfying the conditions, matching the pattern suggested by the enumerated answers.
