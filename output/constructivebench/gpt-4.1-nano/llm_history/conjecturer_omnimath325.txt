The pattern in enumerated answers suggests the minimal N where the divisor sum condition holds when N is divisible by 3. The polynomial condition simplifies to verifying divisibility by X^2 + X + 1, which relates to roots of unity, specifically cube roots. The smallest N satisfying these constraints is N = 3.
