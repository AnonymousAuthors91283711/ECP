Since the sum s is the sum of four positive integers and divides the sum of their products taken three at a time, the minimal such s is 4 (for a=1, b=1, c=1, d=1), and the divisibility condition holds for s=4. Larger sums can be constructed by scaling. The set of all such sums is all multiples of 4 greater or equal to 4. Therefore, the set is {s : ℤ | s ≥ 4 ∧ 4 ∣ s}.
