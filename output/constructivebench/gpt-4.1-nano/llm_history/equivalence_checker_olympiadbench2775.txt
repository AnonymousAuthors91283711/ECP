Ground Truth Answer: 21
Proposed Answer:  8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive function A(n) with:
   - A(0) = 0
   - A(1) = 2
   - For n+1, if n+1 is a perfect square, A(n+1) = sqrt(n+1), else A(n+1) = A(n) + 1

2. We're asked to compute A(K) where K = 9*7 = 63

3. The ground truth answer is 21

4. The proposed answer is 8

Let's compute A(63) step by step:
- From A(2) to A(3): +1 (not square) → A(3)=3
- A(4): square → sqrt(4)=2
- A(5) to A(8): +1 each → A(8)=6
- A(9): square → sqrt(9)=3
- A(10) to A(15): +1 each → A(15)=11
- A(16): square → sqrt(16)=4
- Continuing this way up to 63, we indeed get A(63)=21

The proposed answer 8 is incorrect as it doesn't match the correct computation.
