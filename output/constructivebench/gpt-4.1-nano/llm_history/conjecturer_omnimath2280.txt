The set `S` consists of points where p.2 satisfies \( p_2^4 - p_2^2 = 0 \) leading to \( p_2 \in \{0, 1, -1\} \), and for each fixed \( p_2 \), \( p_1 \) satisfies \( p_1 (p_2^3 - p_2) = 0 \), so \( p_1 = 0 \) or \( p_2^3 - p_2 = 0 \), which simplifies to \( p_2 \in \{0, 1, -1\} \). When \( p_2 \neq 0 \), \( p_1 \) can be any real; when \( p_2 = 0 \), \( p_1 \) only must be zero for the other equations to hold. Collectively, this yields four points: \((0,0), (t,1), (t,-1), (0,-1)\) all with \( t \) arbitrary, but solutions are only finite if considering the simultaneous constraints; the only solutions are the four points where \( p_2 \in \{0, 1, -1\} \) and \( p_1 \) determined accordingly. Since the set is finite, the number of solutions is 4.
