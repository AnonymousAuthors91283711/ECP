theorem omnimath3445 :
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 100 * 2^n > 10000 * (1/2)^n} omnimath3445_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2004
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n such that:
   100 * 2^n > 10000 * (1/2)^n

2. We can simplify the inequality:
   100 * 2^n > 10000 * 2^(-n)
   => 2^n * 2^n > 100
   => 2^(2n) > 100

3. Taking log base 2 of both sides:
   2n > log₂(100)
   => n > (log₂(100))/2 ≈ 3.3219

4. The smallest integer n satisfying this is n = 4.

The ground truth answer claims 2004, which is clearly incorrect as it's orders of magnitude larger than needed. The proposed answer of 4 is mathematically correct.
