theorem olympiadbench2427 (a b : ℝ) :
  (√a + √b = 8 ∧ logb 10 a + logb 10 b = 2) ↔ (a, b) ∈ olympiadbench2427_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ × ℝ)
The patterns in the enumerated answers suggest solutions where a and b are perfect powers related to 10 and 64, considering the properties of the logs and square roots. The conditions imply a = 64, b = 36, which satisfy √a + √b = 8 and log_b 10 a + log_b 10 b = 2.
