theorem P2009AMCA_11 (n : ℕ) (h : n ≥ 3) :
  F n = P2009AMCA_11_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 2 * n^2 - 2 * n + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n => 2 * n * n + 3 * n + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive function F with initial values:
   - F(0) = 1
   - F(1) = 1
   - F(2) = 5
   - F(n+3) = F(n+2) + 4*(n+2)

2. The ground truth answer is a quadratic function: 2n² - 2n + 1

3. The proposed answer is another quadratic function: 2n*n + 3n + 1

Let's test both functions with the given initial conditions:
- For n=0:
  Ground truth: 2*0 - 0 + 1 = 1 ✔
  Proposed: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 ✔
- For n=1:
  Ground truth: 2 - 2 + 1 = 1 ✔
  Proposed: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 ✖ (should be 1)
- For n=2:
  Ground truth: 8 - 4 + 1 = 5 ✔
  Proposed: 8 + 6 + 1 = 15 ✖ (should be 5)

The proposed answer fails to match the given initial conditions of the recursive function F, while the ground truth answer matches perfectly.
