Based on symmetry and pattern in the factors, the coefficient f' relates to total prime-powered factors. The pattern suggests that the sum of exponents corresponds to the total degrees from 1 to 32. Hence, the total sum is 32 × (32 + 1) / 2 = 528. The coefficient f' corresponds to the sum of these, implying:

  coeff p 1 = -2 ∧ (∀ i ∈ Set.Icc 2 32, coeff p i = 0) → f' = omnimath185_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: (32 * 33) // 2. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 43, which is at "// 2" in "abbrev omnimath185_answer : ℕ := (32 * 33) // 2", there is an error: unexpected token '//'; expected command.

The main issue is that Lean does not recognize the `//` syntax for integer division; it expects `div` instead. To fix the compilation error, we should replace `(32 * 33) // 2` with `(32 * 33) / 2`. Given the problem context—dealing with coefficients in a polynomial expansion, likely involving binomial sums—the candidate answer `(32 * 33) / 2` is a plausible closed-form for a sum like the triangular number `n(n+1)/2` at `n=32`. This aligns with the sum of integers from 1 to 32, which often appears in such coefficient problems.

Therefore, the correct and compilable answer in Lean should be:

<<<(32 * 33) / 2>>>

This expression correctly employs the division operator `/`, ensures the answer is a natural number, and fits the expected pattern suggested by the enumerated answer.
