The problem describes a set of functions \(f : Fin 3 \to Fin 3 \to Bool\) with specific conditions on their bipartite adjacency structure, akin to a 3x3 bipartite graph with each row and column having degree 2. From the enumeration, the pattern indicates the total number of such functions is 6, corresponding to the number of 3x3 bipartite graphs with each vertex degree 2 (which is the set of 3-cycles). 

The total number of 3-cycles in a \(K_3\) bipartite graph is 3! = 6, consistent with choosing permutations for the off-diagonal edges satisfying the conditions. 

Since the question asks for a closed-form in terms of `nat`, assuming no overcounting, the final answer should be 6. 

<<<6>>>
