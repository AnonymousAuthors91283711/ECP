The pattern suggests that the set contains integers α where certain quadratic relations hold. Given the symmetry in the conditions, and the range |α| ≤ 2005, the count appears to be proportional to the length of this interval, accounting for the solutions based on parity. The total solutions relate to the number of integers from -2005 to 2005, which is 4011.

Thus, the count should be 4011, reflecting all such α in that interval satisfying the conditions.

<<<4011>>>
