Ground Truth Answer: -3 / 2
Proposed Answer: 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a quadratic polynomial P(x) = x² + bx + c
2. It provides two conditions: P(P(1)) = 0 and P(P(2)) = 0
3. It also states that P(P(1)) ≠ P(P(2))
4. We're asked to find P(0), which would be c since P(0) = 0² + b*0 + c = c

The ground truth answer is -3/2, meaning c = -1.5
The proposed answer is 0, meaning c = 0

Let's check if c=0 could satisfy the conditions:
If c=0, then P(x) = x² + bx
Then P(P(1)) = P(1 + b) = (1+b)² + b(1+b) = 1 + 2b + b² + b + b² = 2b² + 3b + 1 = 0
Similarly P(P(2)) = P(4 + 2b) = (4+2b)² + b(4+2b) = 16 + 16b + 4b² + 4b + 2b² = 6b² + 20b + 16 = 0

Now we have two equations:
2b² + 3b + 1 = 0
6b² + 20b + 16 = 0

The first equation gives b = [-3 ± √(9-8)]/4 → b = -1 or b = -0.5
The second equation gives b = [-20 ± √(400-384)]/12 → b = [-20 ± 4]/12 → b = -16/12 = -4/3 or b = -24/12 = -2

There's no common solution for b in both equations, so c=0 cannot satisfy all conditions.

The ground truth answer -3/2 is correct, while the proposed answer 0 is incorrect.
