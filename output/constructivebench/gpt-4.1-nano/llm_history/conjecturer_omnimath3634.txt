Based on the pattern and logical structure, the function should preserve the divisor count while increasing the gcd in a manner consistent with the pattern in the enumeration. The simplest function satisfying the divisor cardinality condition is f(x) = x, but it does not satisfy the gcd inequality.  
A function of the form f(x) = 2 x likely increases gcds proportionally, matching the inequalities, and preserves divisibility properties.  
Thus, the proposed answer is:  
<<<fun x => 2 * x>>>
