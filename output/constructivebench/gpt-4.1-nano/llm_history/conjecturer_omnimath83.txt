The pattern suggests the minimal value occurs when the influence of the sums balances, leading contraction toward a simple expression involving n and n's reciprocals. Since the expression involves sums over square roots and linear terms, the minimal value is proportional to sqrt(n), and constants involving 2 appear in such sums. Considering symmetry and inequalities known for such sums, a natural candidate is \(\frac{\sqrt{n}}{2}\). 

Thus, the answer is:

<<<fun n : ℕ => (sqrt n) / 2>>>
