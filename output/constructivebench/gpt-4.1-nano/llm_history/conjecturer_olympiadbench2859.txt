The pattern suggests the value is at the maximum of the quadratic \( f(n) = 2 n^2 - k n + 77 \) for prime \(f(n)\). Since \(f(n)\) opens upwards, the minimal point occurs at \( n = \frac{k}{4} \). For large \(T\), the maximum prime value occurs at the endpoint \( n = k \), which yields the greatest \(f(n)\) among the \(n\)’s satisfying the conditions.

Hence, the answer is \( n = 21 + 2T \).
