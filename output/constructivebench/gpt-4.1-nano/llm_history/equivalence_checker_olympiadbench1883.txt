Ground Truth Answer: fun n => ⌈(n : ℝ) / 2⌉.toNat + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal size of a set S of integers such that for every Fibonacci number F(k) with 2 ≤ k ≤ n, there exist x,y ∈ S with x-y = F(k).

2. The ground truth answer suggests that the minimal size is ⌈n/2⌉ + 1. This makes sense because:
   - The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially
   - We can construct such a set by pairing numbers and using the fact that differences can cover multiple Fibonacci numbers
   - The ceiling function accounts for both even and odd n

3. The proposed answer suggests n+1, which is:
   - Always larger than the ground truth answer (since ⌈n/2⌉ + 1 ≤ n+1 for all n ≥ 2)
   - Not minimal, as the ground truth shows a smaller set suffices
   - Doesn't take advantage of the Fibonacci sequence's properties

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't give the minimal size. The ground truth answer is correct and more precise.
