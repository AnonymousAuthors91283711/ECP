theorem omnimath2131 : 
  {x : ℝ | ∃ (n : ℕ), n = 2017 ∧ Nat.iterate (fun y => |y| + x) n 0 = 1} = {omnimath2131_answer} := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the iterative process starts from 0 and adds |y| + x at each step, for the sum to equal 1 after 2017 steps, the difference between the total sum and initial value must be 1. Conjecture that the sum over all steps yields 2017 * |x|, leading to x = 1 / 2017. 
<<<1 / 2017>>>
