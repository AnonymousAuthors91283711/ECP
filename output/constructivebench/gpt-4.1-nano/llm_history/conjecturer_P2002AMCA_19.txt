  Nat.card {x : ℝ | f (f x) = 6} = P2002AMCA_19_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The function f is piecewise constant, with intervals alternating between 6 and 2, with a middle interval of 4. The set {x | f(f x) = 6} covers points mapped twice by 6 via composition, including all x where f x lies within the regions whose preimage under f is occupied by x's leading to 6 after two transformations. This pattern yields 2 endpoints where f is 6 and 4 where f is 2, accounting for the double preimage points, summing to 4.
