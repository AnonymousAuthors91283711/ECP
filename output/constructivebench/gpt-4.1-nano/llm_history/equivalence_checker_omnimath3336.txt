Ground Truth Answer: {0, 1/2, 1}
Proposed Answer: { p | 1/2 ≤ p ∧ p ≤ 1 }
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for which values of p (between 0 and 1) the two probability sums are equal. These sums represent tail probabilities of binomial distributions (Bin(3,p) and Bin(5,p)).

2. The ground truth answer {0, 1/2, 1} suggests that the equality only holds at these three discrete points.

3. The proposed answer { p | 1/2 ≤ p ∧ p ≤ 1 } claims the equality holds for all p in the interval [1/2, 1].

4. Testing p=0: Both sums equal 0 (equality holds)
Testing p=1: Both sums equal 1 (equality holds)
Testing p=1/2: Both sums equal 1/2 (equality holds)
Testing p=3/4: The first sum is 27/64, the second is 26/64 (not equal)

The proposed answer incorrectly includes all values between 1/2 and 1, when in fact only the endpoints and 1/2 satisfy the equality.
