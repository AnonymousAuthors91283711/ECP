The problem counts functions from a 6-element set to a 4-element set with no two adjacent equal values (cyclic). This is a circular derangement problem. The pattern suggests a known recurrence for circular sequences avoiding adjacent repeats. The formula, based on enumeration, yields a constant answer, which is \(4 \times 3^4\). Thus, the concise closed-form is:

<<<4 * 3^4>>>
