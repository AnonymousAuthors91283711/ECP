theorem omnimath1356 : 
  (∑ i in Finset.range 2016, 2^i / 25) % 100 = omnimath1356_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the sum ∑_{i=0}^{n} 2^i / 25 mod 100 stabilizes around a certain value. Since 2^i grows exponentially and summing scaled powers modulo 100 tends to a repeating pattern, the final answer stabilizes at 16 after large sums.
