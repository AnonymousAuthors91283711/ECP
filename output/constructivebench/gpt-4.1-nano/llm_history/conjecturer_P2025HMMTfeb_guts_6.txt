The problem describes points on segments of an equilateral triangle with given distances. Symmetry suggests the minimal configuration when E and F lie symmetrically around the midpoint D, which results in the segments EF having length 2, as the simplest case to satisfy the distances. Thus, I conjecture that the answer is 2.
