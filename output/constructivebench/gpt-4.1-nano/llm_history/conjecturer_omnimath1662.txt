Given the problem's nature, the set s sums over white points counting adjacent black points, resembling grid adjacency counts. The pattern suggests that the maximum sum occurs when the grid has a boundary effect. For n > 2, the maximum is achieved with a boundary configuration, resulting in an approximate maximal sum proportional to n^2. From the enumerated pattern, the correct closed form is proportional to n^2. Therefore, the greatest such sum related to boundary points is about 2 * n^2.
