theorem IMO2023SLN8 (f : ℕ → ℕ) (hf : ∀ n, 0 < n → 0 < f n) :
  (∀ a b, 0 < a → 0 < b → (f^[f a] (a + 1)) = (a + 1) * f b) ↔ f = IMO2023SLN8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The functional equation suggests that iterating f at a + 1 results in a product involving f b, scaled by (a+1). The pattern indicates that f(n) is linear, specifically f(n) = n * 2^{n - 2} for n ≥ 1, matching the recursive structure where each application doubles the previous value proportionally.
