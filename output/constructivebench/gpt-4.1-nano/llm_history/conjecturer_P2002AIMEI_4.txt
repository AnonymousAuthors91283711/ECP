The sum of (1)/(k^2 + k) over k from a to b-1 telescopes: sum = 1/a - 1/b. Given that, 1/a - 1/(b-1) = 1/29, and a + b = P. Solving reduces to a specific pair with a positive integer. The difference of reciprocals yields a ratio that suggests a minimal pair with a = 1 and b = 30. Therefore, P = a + b = 31.
