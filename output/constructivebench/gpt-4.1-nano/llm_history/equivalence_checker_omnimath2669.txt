abbrev omnimath2669_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2669 (x : ℕ) : 
  x^2 + 2*x - x*(x + 1) = omnimath2669_answer x := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => x
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℕ => 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents an equation: x² + 2x - x(x + 1) = answer(x)
2. Let's simplify the left side:
   x² + 2x - x(x + 1) = x² + 2x - x² - x = (x² - x²) + (2x - x) = x
3. Therefore, the equation simplifies to: x = answer(x)
4. The ground truth answer correctly gives answer(x) = x
5. The proposed answer gives answer(x) = 0, which is incorrect

The proposed answer is wrong because it doesn't satisfy the equation for any x ≠ 0. For example:
- When x = 1: 1² + 2*1 - 1*(1+1) = 1 + 2 - 2 = 1 ≠ 0
- When x = 2: 4 + 4 - 6 = 2 ≠ 0

<<<False>>>
