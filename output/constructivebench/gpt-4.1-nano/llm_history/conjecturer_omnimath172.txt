Given the constraints and pattern, N depends on symmetrical differences, and the factorization 2016^n suggests N is a power of 2016. Since 2016 = 2^5 * 3^2 * 7, N's form relates to products of differences constrained by divisibility. The set likely includes triples with differences aligned to divisors of 2016^n, possibly with zero differences for degenerate cases.

The main issue in the proposed answer is the syntax for expressing "for some n ∈ ℕ" within a set comprehension in Lean. The set comprehension syntax in Lean expects logical formulas and quantifiers, but not "for some n" directly inside the raw set notation. To express "there exists n" meaningfully, we need to define the set as the union over all possible n that satisfy the condition, or use a predicate that involves an existential quantifier.

Given the problem statement, the key is to encode the set as all triples (a, b, c) such that the value N, satisfying N = ((a - b) * (b - c) * (c - a)) / 2, is a power of 2016. Therefore, for each triple, N = 2016^n for some n, which is equivalent to N being a power of 2016.

To correct the syntax, we can define the set as:

- The set of all triples (a, b, c) such that N = ((a - b)*(b - c)*(c - a))/2 and N is a power of 2016.

Since we work in Lean, and the set is over ℤ × ℤ × ℤ, we can define the set by:

- For all (a, b, c) with N as above, there exists some n in ℕ with N = 2016^n.

Thus, the correct syntax uses a `∃` quantifier explicitly in the set definition, which is more natural in formal statements.

Therefore, the correction is to define the set as a predicate involving the existential quantifier over n, expressed as:

{ (a, b, c) | ∃ n : ℕ, N = 2016^n }

Since the value N depends on a, b, c, we need to state that as a condition.

Here's the fixed version in Lean syntax:

<<<{ (a, b, c) | ∃ n : ℕ, ((a - b) * (b - c) * (c - a)) / 2 = 2016 ^ n }>>>

This captures all triples where N equals a power of 2016 explicitly, matching the equivalence in the theorem, and respects the syntax requirements.

Final answer: <<<{ (a, b, c) | ∃ n : ℕ, ((a - b) * (b - c) * (c - a)) / 2 = 2016 ^ n }>>>
