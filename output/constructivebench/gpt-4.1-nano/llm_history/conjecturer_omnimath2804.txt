theorem omnimath2804 :
  let sequences := {f : Fin 11 → ℝ | f 0 = 4 ∧ f 10 = 1024 ∧ 
    ∀ n ∈ Finset.Icc 1 10, f n + f (n-1) = 5/2 * Real.sqrt (f n * f (n-1))}
  Nat.card (Subtype sequences) ≡ omnimath2804_answer [MOD 100] := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Considering the recurrence relation, the sequence behaves like a geometric progression with ratio 2, starting from 4 and ending at 1024 over 10 steps. The pattern indicates the sequence's values are powers of 2, doubling each time. Thus, the total number of such sequences modulo 100 is 1, as the sequence is uniquely determined by initial and final conditions. Therefore, the answer is 1.
