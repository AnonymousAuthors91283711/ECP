The pattern suggests that the sum of c n * c (n+2) over 1..2013 simplifies to a product involving powers of 2 and a specific constant, considering the recursive definitions. From the enumerated answers, the constant likely involves 2^(2012) and possibly a factor of 1. 

Final conjecture:

<<<2^(2012)>>>

This matches pattern recognition and the structure of recursive sequences with powers of 2.
