  IsLeast {c : ℝ | ∀ x, x > c → ∃ (y : ℝ), y^2002 = x - 2001^2002} P2004AMCA_16_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The set defines `c` as the greatest lower bound such that for any `x > c`, there exists a `y` satisfying `y^2002 = x - 2001^2002`. The minimal such `c` is when `x` approaches `2001^2002`, where `y` approaches 0 from above. Thus, the least `c` where the condition holds is `2001^2002`.
