theorem omnimath2882 :
    ∑' d : {d : ℕ | d > 0 ∧ d ∣ 1184}, (d : ℤ) = omnimath2882_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Because 1184 factors as 2^4 * 73, and all its positive divisors are generated by these prime factors, the sum of all divisors is (2^(4+1)-1)*(73^(1+1)-1)/(73 - 1) or more straightforwardly, sum of divisors = (2^5 - 1) * (1 + 73). Calculating: (32 - 1) * 74 = 31 * 74 = 2294. So, the answer simplifies to that. 

<<<2294>>>
