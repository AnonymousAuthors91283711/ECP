  (∀ a b : ℕ, a + b > C → (a + f b) ∣ (a^2 + b * f a)) ↔ f ∈ IMO2019SLN4_answer C := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → Set (ℕ → ℕ)
The pattern suggests that the solution involves functions of the form f n = c * n, where c is a constant. Given the divisibility condition, the structure simplifies to linear functions scaled by constants. Therefore, the set includes functions mapping n to multiples of n with specific constants.
