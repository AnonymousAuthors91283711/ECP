The problem involves finding the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that a complex number \( z \) with positive real part and positive imaginary part satisfies \( z^n = (\overline{z})^n \). Since \( z \neq \overline{z} \) unless \( z \) is real, the equality \( z^n = (\overline{z})^n \) implies \( z^n \) is real. For \( z \) with positive real and imaginary parts, the minimal such \( n \) is 2, as the argument of \( z \) is between 0 and \( \pi/2 \), and \( z^2 \) has an argument twice that, which becomes \(\pi\) mod \( 2\pi \), aligning with being real. 

Therefore, the smallest such \( n \) is 2.

Final answer: <<<2>>>
