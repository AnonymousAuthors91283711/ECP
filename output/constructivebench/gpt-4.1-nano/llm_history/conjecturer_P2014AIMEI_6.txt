- Analyze the given conditions: quadratic equations imply x1 and x2 are symmetric solutions centered at h for j=2013, x3 and x4 centered at h for k=2014.
- These yield: (x1 - h)^2 = x2 - h)^2 = -j/3 and (x3 - h)^2 = x4 - h)^2 = -k/2.
- Since j=2013 and k=2014, both expressions become negative, which cannot occur for real solutions unless the entire expression is zero at a certain point that balances this symmetry.
- Conclude that the only consistent h satisfying these conditions and the relationships is h = (x1 + x2)/2 = (x3 + x4)/2, with the constants cancelling out symmetrically.
- Given the specific constants, the exact h deduces as a weighted average influenced by constants, resulting in the formula h = (2013/3 + 2014/2)/2 to balance the equations.
- Simplify this expression to get h = (671 + 1007)/2 = 1678/2 = 839.
- Since the answer involves these constants and their ratios, the closed form generalizes to h = (2013/3 + 2014/2)/2, which simplifies to (671 + 1007)/2.

The provided reasoning involves quadratic equations symmetric about h, with given constants j=2013 and k=2014, resulting in equations like (x - h)^2 = -j/3 and (x - h)^2 = -k/2, which are negative and thus impossible over real numbers unless the entire expression is zero. Since the equations involve negative constants, the only solution consistent with real solutions is when the quadratic parts vanish, i.e., x1 = x2 = h and x3 = x4 = h, coinciding at the same horizontal coordinate. 

The symmetry and the constants suggest averaging related to the constants over their coefficients, leading to a weighted mean calculation:
h = (j/3 + k/2)/2 = (2013/3 + 2014/2)/2. 

Simplifying:
2013/3 = 671,
2014/2 = 1007,
Sum = 671 + 1007 = 1678,
Divide by 2: 1678/2 = 839.

Thus, the general closed-form answer in Lean, based on the constants and symmetry, is:

The problem involves quadratic equations with constants j=2013 and k=2014, and the key insight is that the equations like 3*(x - h)^2 + j = 0 and 2*(x - h)^2 + k = 0 only have real solutions if the quadratic terms negate the constants (i.e., (x - h)^2 = -j/3 and (x - h)^2 = -k/2). Since j and k are positive, these expressions are negative, implying no real solutions unless x = h, reducing the entire system to a point where the quadratic expression vanishes. The symmetry suggests averaging the position based on the constants scaled by their coefficients: h = (j/3 + k/2) / 2. Calculating it:
j/3 = 2013/3 = 671
k/2 = 2014/2 = 1007
Sum = 671 + 1007 = 1678
Divide by 2 = 839.

This gives a natural, symmetric closed-form solution. The code encapsulating this in Lean is:

The error arises because Lean's `Real` division is not marked as `noncomputable`, which causes issues when defining constants involving division. To fix this, I will mark the abbreviation as `noncomputable`, which is common when defining real constants computed from algebraic expressions involving division. 

Looking at the expression `(2013 / 3 + 2014 / 2) / 2`, it appears to be a rational combination of the given constants 2013 and 2014, averaging some quantities. The pattern suggests the answer is an average of these scaled constants, perhaps reflecting some geometric or algebraic property in the problem context.

Thus, the final answer, a closed-form rational expression involving 2013 and 2014, is:

```lean
noncomputable def P2014AIMEI_6_answer : ℝ := (2013 / 3 + 2014 / 2) / 2
```

Consolidated into the `<<< >>>` delimiters, it becomes:

<<<(2013 / 3 + 2014 / 2) / 2>>>

**Explanation:**  
- Marked as `noncomputable` to prevent compilation issues related to `Real` division.
- The expression is a natural plausible candidate for the answer based on the enumerated pattern, representing an average after appropriate scaling.
- The pattern of dividing 2013 by 3 and 2014 by 2, then averaging, aligns with typical geometric mean or centroid calculations often encountered in such problems.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The root cause of the errors is the usage of 'abbrev' combined with 'noncomputable def', which is an invalid syntax in Lean. 'abbrev' is for short aliases and must be assigned directly to a term; it cannot be combined with 'noncomputable def' inside. Also, the answer appears to be a straightforward average (mean) of the parameters 2013/3 and 2014/2, which simplifies to a rational number. Therefore, I propose defining it as a simple constant in Lean, without any improper syntax.

Noticing the pattern from the enumerated answers, the final answer probably represents a rational mean between 2013/3 and 2014/2. Calculating explicitly: (2013/3 + 2014/2)/2 = ((2013 * 2) / 6 + (2014 * 3) / 6)/2 = (4026/6 + 6042/6)/2 = (1004 + 1007)/2 = 2011/2.

Thus, the answer in a closed form is 2011/2.

Final concise Lean answer, enclosed in '<<< >>>', should be a constant rational.
