Ground Truth Answer: -4
Proposed Answer: (-2 : ℂ)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves finding the sum of (r_i)^2 divided by the sum of other roots' squares for a quartic polynomial.

2. The polynomial is f(X) = X^4 - 4X^3 + 8X^2 - 7X + 3.

3. First, we can factor the polynomial:
   f(X) = (X-1)^2(X^2 - 2X + 3)
   So the roots are: 1 (double root), 1±i√2

4. The roots are: r₁ = 1, r₂ = 1, r₃ = 1+i√2, r₄ = 1-i√2

5. Calculating the required sum:
   For each root r_i, we need to compute r_i² divided by the sum of squares of the other three roots.

6. For r₁ = 1:
   denominator = 1² + (1+i√2)² + (1-i√2)² = 1 + (1 - 2 + 2i√2) + (1 - 2 - 2i√2) = 1 + (-1 + 2i√2) + (-1 - 2i√2) = -1
   term = 1² / (-1) = -1

7. Similarly for r₂ = 1, we get the same term: -1

8. For r₃ = 1+i√2:
   denominator = 1² + 1² + (1-i√2)² = 1 + 1 + (-1 - 2i√2) = 1 - 2i√2
   term = (1+i√2)² / (1 - 2i√2) = (-1 + 2i√2)/(1 - 2i√2) = -1

9. Similarly for r₄ = 1-i√2, we get term = -1

10. Total sum = -1 + -1 + -1 + -1 = -4

The ground truth answer is -4, while the proposed answer is -2. They are not equivalent.
