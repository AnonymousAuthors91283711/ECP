Based on the enumeration, patterns suggest that the solution involves small positive integers whose combinations satisfy the equation. Since the equation factors into a product equal to 84, likely involving divisors of 84, and considering symmetric variables, a closed form involves the divisors of 84 and their combinations. The highest common divisor or the minimal construction indicates the answer in terms of divisors of 84, scaled accordingly, focusing on small positive solutions:

<<<9>>>

Because the enumeration points toward a small constant, 9, as the answer encapsulating the set's cardinality or the derived minimal value satisfying the equation.
