Ground Truth Answer: (16, 3, 1, 1)
Proposed Answer: (1, 4, 6, 0)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a system of 7 equations with 4 variables (w, d, a, b). All variables must be positive integers.

2. The ground truth answer (16, 3, 1, 1) satisfies all equations:
   - For example, the first equation: 16*6 + 3*4 + 1*30 + 1*63 = 96 + 12 + 30 + 63 = 201
   - Similarly, it satisfies all other equations.

3. The proposed answer (1, 4, 6, 0):
   - Fails the positivity constraint (b=0 is not >0)
   - Doesn't satisfy most equations. For example:
     First equation: 1*6 + 4*4 + 6*30 + 0*63 = 6 + 16 + 180 + 0 = 202 ≠ 201
     Second equation: 1*6 + 4*3 + 6*35 + 0*60 = 6 + 12 + 210 + 0 = 228 ≠ 200

The proposed answer violates multiple constraints and doesn't solve the system.
