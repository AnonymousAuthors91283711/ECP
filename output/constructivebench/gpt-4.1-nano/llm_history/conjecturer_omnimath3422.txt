Given the pattern, each expression involves n^2 = k^(2k-1), where k ranges from 3 to 6. The perfect squares are 2^3, 3^5, 4^7, 5^9, 6^{11}, indicating n = k^{(k-1)/2}. The logical OR connective suggests the set encompasses such n. The minimal n satisfying one of these is obtained when k=3: n=3^{(3-1)/2}= 3^{1}=3. To cover the entire pattern, the answer is the smallest such n, i.e., 3.
