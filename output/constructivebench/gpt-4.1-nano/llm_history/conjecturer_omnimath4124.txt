The pattern suggests that for each n > 0, the condition reduces to the set {n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, n+5} with the product of the first three equal to the product of the last three. This implies the answer is the set of all such n satisfying n * (n+1) * (n+2) = (n+3) * (n+4) * (n+5). The only n > 0 with this property is n=1, since for larger n the products grow apart. 

Thus, the set contains only 1.
