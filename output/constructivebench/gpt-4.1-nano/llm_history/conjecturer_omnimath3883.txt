  (∀ x y, x > 0 → y > 0 → f (x^2 * (f y)^2) = (f x)^2 * f y) ↔ f = omnimath3883_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ → ℚ
The functional equation suggests multiplicative and squared behavior, implying f might be proportional to x or a constant. Considering the structure, the key pattern is f(x^2 * (f y)^2) = (f x)^2 * f y. Testing f(x) = x^(a), it simplifies to conditions on a. The only consistent solution is linear, f(x) = x.
