Ground Truth Answer: 193
Proposed Answer: 156
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

The problem is asking for the smallest sum a + b where:
1. a and b are positive integers
2. 79 divides (a + 77b)
3. 77 divides (a + 79b)

The ground truth answer is 193, while the proposed answer is 156.

To verify, let's check if 156 can be achieved:
We need to find a, b > 0 such that a + b = 156 and satisfies both divisibility conditions.

From the conditions:
1. a ≡ -77b mod 79
2. a ≡ -79b mod 77

Using a = 156 - b:
1. 156 - b ≡ -77b mod 79 => 156 ≡ 78b mod 79
2. 156 - b ≡ -79b mod 77 => 156 ≡ 78b mod 77

Simplifying:
1. 156 ≡ -b mod 79 (since 78 ≡ -1 mod 79)
2. 156 ≡ b mod 77 (since 78 ≡ 1 mod 77)

Thus:
1. b ≡ -156 mod 79 ≡ 1 mod 79
2. b ≡ 156 mod 77 ≡ 2 mod 77

We need b ≡ 1 mod 79 and b ≡ 2 mod 77. The smallest such b is 1562 (using Chinese Remainder Theorem), which is much larger than 156. Therefore, 156 cannot be the correct answer.

The ground truth answer 193 works with a=116, b=77:
- 116 + 77*77 = 116 + 5929 = 6045 = 79*76.5 (doesn't divide)
Wait, this seems incorrect. Actually, checking properly:
For a=116, b=77:
1. 116 + 77*77 = 6045, which is not divisible by 79 (6045/79 ≈ 76.52)
2. 116 + 79*77 = 116 + 6083 = 6199, which is not divisible by 77 (6199/77 ≈ 80.506)

This suggests neither answer might be correct, but the ground truth is claimed to be 193. The proposed answer 156 is definitely incorrect as shown above.
