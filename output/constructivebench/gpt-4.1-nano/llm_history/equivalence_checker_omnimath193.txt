Ground Truth Answer: { (m, n) : ℕ × ℕ | m.Coprime n ∧ Odd m ∧ Odd n ∧ ∃ k, m + n = 2^k }
Proposed Answer: { p : ℕ × ℕ | p.1.Coprime p.2 ∧ Odd p.1 ∧ Odd p.2 ∧ ∃ k, p.1 + p.2 = 2^k }
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer and the ground truth answer are equivalent. Both define the same set of pairs of natural numbers (m, n) where:
1. m and n are coprime (m.Coprime n)
2. m is odd (Odd m)
3. n is odd (Odd n)
4. There exists a k such that m + n = 2^k

The only difference is in notation:
- Ground truth uses (m, n) directly in the set comprehension
- Proposed answer uses p.1 and p.2 to refer to the first and second components of the pair p

Both formulations describe exactly the same mathematical set.
