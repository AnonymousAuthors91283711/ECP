Given the factorial difference and modulo 10 pattern, the final answer aligns with the last digit of factorial differences for \(b > a\). The pattern suggests the last digit stabilizes at 4 for large \(b - a\). The conclusion is that the value is 4, which matches the observed pattern in the enumerations and factorial properties.
