The two sets are equal, implying they share solutions to their respective quadratics. Since both define the same roots, equate the quadratic coefficients and constants; substituting T=20, this simplifies to a linear relation involving b. The minimal consistent a that works for any b by eliminating b yields a = 1. Thus, the answer is a constant, independent of b.
