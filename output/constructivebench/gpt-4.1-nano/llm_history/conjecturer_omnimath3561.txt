The pattern indicates that for the minimal such k, the set achieves the property with the smallest k ≥ 2. Since the condition involves variables a, b, c in P with a * b = c, and the set is an interval, the smallest k satisfying this property intuitively is k=4, as 2×2=4 introduces the first such product within {2, 3, 4}. Thus, the answer is the minimal such k, which is 4.
