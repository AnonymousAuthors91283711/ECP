Ground Truth Answer: fun N => Int.floor ((N : ℝ) / 100)
Proposed Answer: fun N : ℕ => (N / 100) - 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest integer k such that k < N/100, where N is defined as 100² * √2.

2. The ground truth answer uses `Int.floor ((N : ℝ) / 100)`, which correctly gives the greatest integer less than N/100.

3. The proposed answer uses `(N / 100) - 1`:
   - For N = 100² * √2 ≈ 14142.1356
   - N/100 ≈ 141.421356
   - The correct floor would be 141
   - But (N/100) - 1 would be 140.421356 (when N is cast to ℝ first) or 140 (if using integer division)

4. The proposed answer is incorrect because:
   - If using integer division (which truncates toward zero), it would be off by more than 1 in some cases
   - Even if using real division, subtracting 1 gives a number that's too small

5. The correct answer should be the floor function, which the ground truth provides.
