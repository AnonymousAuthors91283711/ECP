theorem olympiadbench2746 :
  1 / (Nat.choose 13 2 * Nat.choose 13 2) = olympiadbench2746_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The pattern suggests a symmetrical structure involving dividing 1 by a square of binomial coefficients. Given the numbers involved, the probable simplified form is 1 divided by the square of the combination of 13 choose 2, which is (13*12/2)=78. Thus, the answer is 1 / 78^2.
