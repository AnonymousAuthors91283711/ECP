theorem omnimath377 : 
  (Finset.univ (α := Fin 6 × Fin 6)).sum (fun d => if (d.1 + 1 + d.2 + 1) % 5 = 0 then (1 : ℚ)/36 else 0) = omnimath377_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The probability that (d.1 + 1 + d.2 + 1) ≡ 0 mod 5 over all 36 pairs (as each d.1, d.2 vary over Fin 6) is the count of solutions divided by 36. For 36 total, exactly 6 satisfy the congruence condition. Thus, the probability is 6/36 = 1/6.
