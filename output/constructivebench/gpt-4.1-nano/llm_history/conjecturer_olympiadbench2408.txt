Given the inequalities and equations, the bounds on (a, b, c, d) imply a sequence with incremental differences, and the sums and products suggest a pattern close to evenly spread values. The total sum of 296 and the sum of products imply approximate values around a common average. The pattern indicates symmetric solutions, with minimal possible values for a, increasing b, c, d accordingly. Based on enumeration, the likely counts circle around partitioning 296 into increasing positive integers fitting the equations. The total count of solutions appears to be 33.
