The pattern in the enumerated answers indicates a quadratic function of n, scaled by 2. Based on these observations, the answer likely models the minimal number k in terms of n, reflecting a quadratic growth and constant factor. 

Therefore, the answer is: 

<<<fun n : ℕ => n * (n + 1)>>>

which aligns with the pattern of quadratic forms in combinatorial structures involving n.
