The problem asks for the smallest positive integer divisible by 17 with digit sum 17. The smallest such number is formed by the smallest number with digits summing to 17 that is divisible by 17. The minimal number with digit sum 17 is 89, but 89 is not divisible by 17. The next candidate with digit sum 17 and minimal number is 107, which is divisible by 17—and 17 divides 107. Thus, the minimal such m is 107. 

Answer: <<<107>>>
