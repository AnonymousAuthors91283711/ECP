Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n^2 / 4 + n / 2
Proposed Answer: fun n => n * n / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal number of points to mark on an n×n grid (where n is even and positive) such that every unmarked point is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to at least one marked point.

2. The ground truth answer is n²/4 + n/2. For even n, this simplifies to (n² + 2n)/4.

3. The proposed answer is n*n/2, which is n²/2.

Let's test with concrete even values of n:

For n=2:
- Ground truth: (4+4)/4 = 2
- Proposed: 4/2 = 2
They match.

For n=4:
- Ground truth: (16+8)/4 = 6
- Proposed: 16/2 = 8
They don't match.

For n=6:
- Ground truth: (36+12)/4 = 12
- Proposed: 36/2 = 18
They don't match.

The answers only match when n=2 but diverge for larger even values. The proposed answer grows quadratically while the ground truth grows linearly with n.
