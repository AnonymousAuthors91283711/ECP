Since a = b and a * b * c = 128 with positive a, b, c, it follows that a^2 * c = 128. The positive integers satisfying a^2 divides 128 are a=1,2,4,8, and the corresponding c values are 128, 32, 8, 2 respectively. Summing these gives 2a + c = 2a + (128 / a^2). For the consistent solutions, a=2 leads to c=32, sum=2+2+32=36; a=4 → c=8, sum=4+4+8=16; a=8 → c=2, sum=8+8+2=18. The minimal sum corresponds to a=4. Therefore, the minimal sum is 16.

Hence, the answer is 16.

<<<16>>>
