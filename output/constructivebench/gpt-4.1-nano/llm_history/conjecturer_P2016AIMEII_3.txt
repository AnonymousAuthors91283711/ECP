theorem P2016AIMEII_3 :
  ∀ (x y z : ℝ), (x * y * z = 1) ∧ (log x / log 5 = 100) ∧ (log y / log 5 = -60) ∧ (log z / log 5 = 20) →
  |log x / log 5| + |log y / log 5| + |log z / log 5| = P2016AIMEII_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the logs of x, y, z relative to log base 5, their absolute sums are |100| + |60| + |20| = 180. The a priori constraints imply the product condition is satisfied. The enumerated pattern suggests the answer is the sum of these absolute values. 

<<<180>>>

This is a closed-form answer consistent with the log relationships and the given pattern.
