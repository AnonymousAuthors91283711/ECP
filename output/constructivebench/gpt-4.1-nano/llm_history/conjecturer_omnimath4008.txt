Given the symmetry and bounds of x, y ≥ 0 with x + y ≤ 1, the minimal value occurs at a symmetric point. The pattern suggests the minimum of z occurs at x = y = 1/3, leading to z = (1/3)^4 + (1/3)^4 - (1/3)^2*(1/3) - (1/3)*(1/3)^2. Calculating this simplifies to 2*(1/3)^4 - 2*(1/3)^3 = (2/81) - (2/27) = (2/81) - (6/81) = -4/81.
