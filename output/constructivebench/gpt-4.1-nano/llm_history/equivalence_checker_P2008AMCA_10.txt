noncomputable abbrev P2008AMCA_10_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem P2008AMCA_10 (t : ℝ) :
  (1/5 + 1/7) * (t - 1) = 1 ↔ P2008AMCA_10_answer t = 1 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun t => (1/5 + 1/7) * (t - 1)
Proposed Answer: fun t : ℝ => 1 + 35/12
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a function P2008AMCA_10_answer such that the equation (1/5 + 1/7)*(t-1) = 1 is equivalent to P2008AMCA_10_answer t = 1.

2. The ground truth answer provides the function exactly as it appears in the left side of the equation.

3. The proposed answer gives a constant function (always returns 1 + 35/12 regardless of input t).

The ground truth answer is correct because:
- It directly represents the left side of the equation
- Solving (1/5 + 1/7)*(t-1) = 1 for t gives t = 1 + 35/12, but this is just one solution, not the general function

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It's a constant function that doesn't depend on t
- It only gives the solution when the equation equals 1, not the general form
- It doesn't satisfy the "iff" condition for all t

<<<False>>>
