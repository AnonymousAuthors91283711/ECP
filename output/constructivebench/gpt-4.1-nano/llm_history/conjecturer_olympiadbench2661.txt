  IsLeast {K : ℕ | 4 * 3 * 2 * K ≥ 70} olympiadbench2661_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the condition \(4 \times 3 \times 2 \times K \geq 70\), simplifying yields \(24K \geq 70\). Solving for \(K\) gives \(K \geq 70/24 \approx 2.916...\). The least integer \(K\) satisfying this is 3. Therefore:
