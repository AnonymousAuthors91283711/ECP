The enumeration suggests that S includes all n where n! can be expressed as a sum of distinct factorials with factorials of distinct numbers. The pattern indicates the maximum sum of such factorials is 240, involving small factorials. As the problem constraints are within n > 0 and n ≤ 240, the total count corresponds to the total such sums, which is 14.
