The minimal sum of the squares under the given constraints strongly suggests choosing values 1, 2, 3, 4 to minimize the sum. For sum = 513 and sum-of-fourth powers = 4745, the optimal configuration is to maximize the number of 4s, then 3s, etc., balancing to reach total sum 513 and sum of fourth powers 4745. The distribution corresponds to (128 elements of 4, 1 element of 1, 224 elements of 2), totaling 353 elements with a sum of squares of: 128*16 + 1*1 + 224*4 = 2048 + 1 + 896 = 2945. Thus, inferred minimal sum: 2945.
