Ground Truth Answer: 32
Proposed Answer: (75 - 25 - 1) * (250 - 120 - 1)
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is asking for the cardinality of the set of integer pairs (p₁, p₂) where:
1. p₂ = 4*p₁ + 3
2. 25 < p₁ < 75
3. 120 < p₂ < 250

The ground truth answer is 32, which is correct because:
- p₁ ranges from 26 to 74 (49 values)
- p₂ must satisfy 120 < 4*p₁ + 3 < 250
- This gives 30 < p₁ < 61.75 → p₁ from 31 to 61 (31 values)
- The intersection is p₁ from 31 to 61 (31 values) minus p₁=62 (where p₂=251 which is excluded)
- So total is 31 values

The proposed answer attempts to calculate (75-25-1)*(250-120-1) = 49*129 = 6321, which is completely wrong because:
1. It doesn't account for the relationship p₂ = 4*p₁ + 3
2. It's calculating the product of two independent ranges, not their constrained intersection
3. The numbers don't match at all (6321 vs 32)

<<<False>>>
