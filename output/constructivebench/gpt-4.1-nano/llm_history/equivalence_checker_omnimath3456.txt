abbrev omnimath3456_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3456 :
  Real.sqrt (3 ^ 3 + 3 ^ 3 + 3 ^ 3) = omnimath3456_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 9
Proposed Answer: 2 * 3
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to simplify √(3³ + 3³ + 3³)
2. First, let's compute the expression inside the square root:
   - 3³ = 27
   - So we have √(27 + 27 + 27) = √(81)
3. √81 = 9, which matches the ground truth answer
4. The proposed answer is 2 * 3 = 6, which is incorrect

The proposed answer is not equivalent to the ground truth answer. The correct simplification should be 9, not 6.

<<<False>>>
