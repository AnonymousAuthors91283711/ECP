The current error arises because `a`, `b`, and `c` are not in scope in the definition of `omnimath466_answer`. They appear as free variables in the attempted expression, but in Lean, an expression for a value (here, ℕ) needs to be a closed term without free variables. 

The logical inference from the problem statement and the pattern in the enumerated answers indicates that the target is a constant value, likely `4`. The numerator `(a + b + c)^2` and denominator `(a * b)` are functions of the triangle's parameters, but the goal for the answer is to state a fixed value of this expression, suggesting the answer is a specific constant `4`. 

Given the question's pattern, the best closed form matching the enumerated answer and the problem context is:

<<<4>>>

This choice is consistent—it avoids free variables and matches the pattern seen in known solutions for similar right triangle problems, especially ones involving ratios of sums and products. The proof likely involves showing this ratio always equals 4 for primitive Pythagorean triples with certain properties, and the answer just encodes the constant value.
