The polynomial \(r^4 + k r^3 + r^2 + 4k r + 16 = 0\) suggests roots depend on \(k\). To have exactly one real root, the other roots must be complex conjugates. The pattern shows that for a single real solution, the specific \(k\) must satisfy certain conditions derived from the polynomial's discriminant. The consistent pattern points to the parameter \(k\) that yields a perfect square polynomial with a double root. Then, the answer is \(k = -2\), producing a unique real root.
