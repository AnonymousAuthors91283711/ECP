The conditions involve divisibility by 75 and 783, implying n divides these factors appropriately. Since 75 = 3 * 5 * 5 and 783 = 3 * 3 * 3 * 29, n must divide their least common multiple. The common factors suggest n = 3, satisfying both divisibility conditions minimally. Therefore, the least such n is 3.
