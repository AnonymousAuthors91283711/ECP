The pattern suggests the sum involves the reciprocal of determinants, which resemble scaled Fibonacci numbers. Based on the structure, the sum converges to a rational number where sum equals 1. Therefore, the final `p + q` is 1, implying `p = 1` and `q = 1`. Final answer generalized is 1, a constant.
