The pattern suggests the expression involves simplifying the function involving roots and powers, which often reduces to a constant or a simple form. The expression `(x^2 + 2 - sqrt(x^4 + 4))/x` resembles the difference of two terms that can be combined via rationalization. Noticing that when rationalized, it simplifies to `√(x^2 + 2) - x`, which for x > 0 can be arbitrarily close to zero, but the greatest value achieved is at x → 0+, approaching 1. 

Final answer: <<<1>>>
