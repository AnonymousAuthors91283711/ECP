Given the sum structure, the pattern from enumeration suggests the answer correlates with dividing 2007 into parts related to the digit sum manipulations. Based on typical problem structure, the minimal n satisfying the sum is about 2007 itself, often linked with the counteracting digit sum effects. Thus, the closed form is n = 2007.
