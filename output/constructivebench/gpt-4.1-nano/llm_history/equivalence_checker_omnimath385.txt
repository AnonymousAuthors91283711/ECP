Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives a cubic polynomial P(x) = x³ - x² - x + 2 and asks for the number of real roots (cardinality of the solution set where P(x) = 0).

2. For cubic polynomials, the number of real roots can be 1 or 3 (counting multiplicities).

3. Let's analyze P(x):
   - P(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 + 2 = 1
   - P(0) = 2
   - P(1) = 1 - 1 - 1 + 2 = 1
   - P(-2) = -8 - 4 + 2 + 2 = -8
   - The derivative P'(x) = 3x² - 2x - 1 has roots at x = 1 and x = -1/3
   - The polynomial is decreasing on (-1/3, 1) and increasing elsewhere
   - The minimum value is P(1) = 1 > 0, so the polynomial never crosses zero

4. The ground truth answer is 1, which is incorrect because the polynomial has no real roots (should be 0). However, the proposed answer is 2, which is also incorrect.

5. Since neither answer is correct, they are not equivalent.
