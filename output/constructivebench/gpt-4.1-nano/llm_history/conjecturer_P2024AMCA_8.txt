The condition log(sin(3θ)) + log(cos(2θ)) = 0 ⇔ sin(3θ) * cos(2θ) = 1. Since sin(3θ) ≤ 1 and cos(2θ) ≤ 1, their product equals 1 only when both are 1. sin(3θ) = 1 at 3θ = π/2 + 2kπ; cos(2θ) = 1 at 2θ = 2mπ. Solving these gives θ = π/6 + (2kπ)/3 and θ = mπ; intersections occur at θ = π/6 + 2kπ/3 with θ = mπ, within [0, 2π]. The solutions correspond to three points in [0, 2π], each with unique θ satisfying both conditions; total count is 3. Thus, the answer is 3.
