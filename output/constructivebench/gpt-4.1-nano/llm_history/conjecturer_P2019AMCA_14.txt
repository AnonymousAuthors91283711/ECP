Given the polynomial coefficients and roots, the polynomial's roots are related to the parameter c such that the sum of roots equals the negative coefficient of X^3, which is 3-2I. The roots of the polynomial generate the sum involving c, and by Vieta's formulas, the roots' sums are related to c's magnitude depending on the specific roots' structure. Based on the pattern and structure, the final answer appears to be the squared magnitude of c.
