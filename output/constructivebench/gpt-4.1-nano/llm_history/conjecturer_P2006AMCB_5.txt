theorem P2006AMCB_5 : 
  IsLeast {t : ℝ | 0 ≤ t ∧ 5 * (t / 60) - 3 * (t / 60) = 1} P2006AMCB_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The set simplifies to t satisfying 0 ≤ t and (5t/60 - 3t/60 = 1) which simplifies to (2t/60 = 1), hence t = 30. The least element is then 30.

<<<30>>>
