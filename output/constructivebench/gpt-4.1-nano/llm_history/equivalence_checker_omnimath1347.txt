Ground Truth Answer: 224/225
Proposed Answer: (1 / 2) - (1 / (91 * 92))
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem: We need to evaluate the sum ∑_{i=0}^13 (2i+3)/(i²(i+1)²) and show it equals some value.

Ground Truth: 224/225 ≈ 0.995555...
Proposed: (1/2) - (1/(91*92)) ≈ 0.5 - 0.0001195 ≈ 0.49988

The proposed answer is significantly different from the ground truth (0.49988 vs 0.99555). 

Moreover, let's think about the sum structure:
- The terms are positive and decreasing
- The first term (i=0) is undefined (division by zero)
- The sum from i=1 would start with (5/4) for i=1, which already exceeds both answers

Therefore, the proposed answer is clearly incorrect. The ground truth answer is correct based on telescoping series properties where this type of sum typically telescopes to 1 - 1/(n+1)² for similar forms.
