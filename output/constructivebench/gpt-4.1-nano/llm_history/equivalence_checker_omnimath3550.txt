Ground Truth Answer: {m : ℤ | ∃ k : ℤ, k^2 = m ∨ 2*k^2 = m}
Proposed Answer: { m : ℤ | ∃ k : ℤ, m = (k^2 - 4)/2 }
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer describes all integers m such that m is either a perfect square or twice a perfect square. The proposed answer suggests m = (k² - 4)/2 for some integer k.

Let's test some values:
1. For m = 1 (which is 1²):
   The proposed answer would require 1 = (k² - 4)/2 ⇒ k² = 6 ⇒ no integer solution
   But m=1 is in the ground truth answer.

2. For m = 2 (which is 2*1²):
   The proposed answer would require 2 = (k² - 4)/2 ⇒ k² = 8 ⇒ no integer solution
   But m=2 is in the ground truth answer.

3. For m = 0 (which is 0²):
   The proposed answer would require 0 = (k² - 4)/2 ⇒ k² = 4 ⇒ k=±2
   So m=0 is in both answers.

The proposed answer misses many cases that are in the ground truth answer (all perfect squares and twice perfect squares that don't satisfy (k²-4)/2 being integer). The two sets are not equivalent.
