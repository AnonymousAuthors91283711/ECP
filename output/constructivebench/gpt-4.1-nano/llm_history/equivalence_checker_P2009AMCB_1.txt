Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find a natural number b ≤ 5 such that there exists some natural number m where the equation 50*(5-b) + 75*b = 100*m holds.

2. Let's simplify the equation:
   50*(5-b) + 75*b = 250 - 50b + 75b = 250 + 25b = 100*m

3. This means 250 + 25b must be divisible by 100, or equivalently:
   25(10 + b) ≡ 0 mod 100
   => 10 + b ≡ 0 mod 4 (since gcd(25,100)=25)

4. So we're looking for b ≤ 5 where 10 + b is divisible by 4.

5. Let's test b values from 0 to 5:
   - b=0: 10+0=10 ≡ 2 mod 4
   - b=1: 10+1=11 ≡ 3 mod 4
   - b=2: 10+2=12 ≡ 0 mod 4 (solution)
   - b=3: 10+3=13 ≡ 1 mod 4
   - b=4: 10+4=14 ≡ 2 mod 4
   - b=5: 10+5=15 ≡ 3 mod 4

6. Only b=2 satisfies the condition, which matches the ground truth answer.

7. The proposed answer is 4, which we can see doesn't satisfy the condition (10+4=14 ≡ 2 mod 4 ≠ 0 mod 4).
