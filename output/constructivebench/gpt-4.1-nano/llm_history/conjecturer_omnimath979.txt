The problem describes a function \(f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) with monotonicity, \(f(2a)=f(a)+1\), and initial value \(f(1)=1\). This relation suggests \(f(n)=\log_2(n)+1\). For the finite set of tuples over 2014, the cardinality involves dividing 2014 by powers of 2, so the total count approximates to summing these contributions. The enumeration pattern indicates the total count equals \(2^{\lfloor \log_2 2014 \rfloor}\).
