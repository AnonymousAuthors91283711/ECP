  N ≡ omnimath2439_answer [MOD 103] := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem involves functions \(f\) where \(f^{101}(1) = 2\), forming a cycle condition. The key insight is recognizing the problem relates to cycles in the permutation and fixed points modulo 103, with the order 101 implying a root of unity property. With consistent pattern matching and properties of permutations and cycles of length 101, the number of such functions modulo 103 is 102. Therefore, the closed form is \(102\).

<<<102>>>
