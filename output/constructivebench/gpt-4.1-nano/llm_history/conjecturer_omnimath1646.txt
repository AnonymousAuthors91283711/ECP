abbrev omnimath1646_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1646 (n : ℕ) :
  (∃ a b : ℕ, a^2 + b^2 = n ∧ Nat.Coprime a b ∧ 
   ∀ p : ℕ, p.Prime → p ≤ Real.sqrt n → p ∣ a * b) ↔ n ∈ omnimath1646_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The condition describes integers n that can be expressed as the sum of two squares with coprime components, and all prime factors less than or equal to sqrt n dividing a * b, which suggests n is a product of two coprime square components. This is characterized by numbers that are either prime or products of two coprime squares with specific factors.  
Final answer: <<<{ n | ∃ a b : ℕ, a^2 + b^2 = n ∧ Nat.Coprime a b }>>>
