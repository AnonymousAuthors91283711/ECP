Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 11
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the number of integer pairs (a,b) where:
   - 4 < a < b < 22
   - (4 + a + b + 22)/4 = 13

2. Let's solve the equation:
   (4 + a + b + 22)/4 = 13
   => 26 + a + b = 52
   => a + b = 26

3. So we need to count pairs (a,b) where:
   - 4 < a < b < 22
   - a + b = 26

4. Possible pairs:
   (5,21), (6,20), (7,19), (8,18), (9,17), (10,16), (11,15), (12,14)

5. That's exactly 8 pairs.

The proposed answer of 11 is incorrect as it counts more pairs than actually satisfy the conditions. The ground truth answer of 8 is correct.
