Ground Truth Answer: fun y => -y
Proposed Answer: fun y : ℤ => -3 * y
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us the equation (x + 2y) - (2x + y) = answer(y) with the constraint x = 2y.

2. Let's simplify the left side:
   (x + 2y) - (2x + y) = x + 2y - 2x - y = -x + y

3. Substitute x = 2y:
   -x + y = -2y + y = -y

4. Therefore, the correct answer should be fun y => -y (ground truth).

5. The proposed answer is fun y => -3*y, which is incorrect.

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth after simplification.

<<<False>>>
