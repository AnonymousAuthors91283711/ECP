The set is fixed: s = {-7, -5, -3, -2, 2, 4, 6, 13}. The minimal n occurs when the sums of two 4-element subsets squared are minimized. Choosing subsets with sums close to zero balances the sum, minimizing the total. The optimal partition is s₁ = {-5, -3, -2, 2}, s₂ = {-7, -5, 4, 6}, which balances the sums. Calculating:
s₁.sum = (-5)+(-3)+(-2)+2 = -8; s₂.sum = (-7)+(-5)+4+6 = -2; n = (-8)^2 + (-2)^2 = 64 + 4 = 68.
Hence, the minimal n is 68.

. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The main issue is with the definition of `P2005AMCB_20_answer` as `fun n : ℕ => 68`, which yields a function type `(n : ℕ) → ℕ` rather than a simple `ℕ`. The abbreviation expects a fixed natural number, representing the answer, not a function. 

Looking at the enumerated answers, the candidate answer `68` appears to be a specific value satisfying the problem's conditions. Since the theorem asks to prove such an `n` is least with the given property, the answer should be a concrete number: 68.

Hence, the fix is to set `P2005AMCB_20_answer` directly as 68, rather than as a function.

**Conjectured answer in Lean:**

<<<68>>>
