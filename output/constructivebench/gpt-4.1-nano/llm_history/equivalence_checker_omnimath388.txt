Ground Truth Answer: 64
Proposed Answer: 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find 2^2001 modulo (2^7 - 1), where 2^7 - 1 = 127.

2. The ground truth answer is 64, which is correct because:
   - 2^7 ≡ 1 mod 127 (since 2^7 - 1 = 127)
   - Therefore, 2^2001 = (2^7)^285 * 2^6 ≡ 1^285 * 64 ≡ 64 mod 127

3. The proposed answer is 2, which is incorrect because:
   - It doesn't account for the full periodicity of powers of 2 modulo 127
   - The correct remainder should be 64 as shown above

The proposed answer is simply wrong, not just partially correct or domain-specific.
