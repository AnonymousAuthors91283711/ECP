The problem finds the closest integer "distance" to the given total steps divided by steps per mile, which simplifies to totalSteps/stepsPerMile. The totalSteps computes to 44×100000 + 50000 = 4,450,000. Dividing this by 1800 yields approximately 2472.222..., which rounds to 2472 in integer terms as the closest. Therefore,

<<<2472>>>

as the unique closest integer answer.
