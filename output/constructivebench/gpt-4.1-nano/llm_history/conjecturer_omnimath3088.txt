  (ncard favorableSeatings : ℚ) / (ncard validSeatings : ℚ) = omnimath3088_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The ratio is determined by fixing David at position 2 and Pedro at either position 1 or 3. Since David’s position is fixed, the remaining 4 seats are assigned to 4 people bijectively; Pedro has 2 options. The total valid arrangements are \(4!\), and favorable ones are \(2 \times 3!\). Ratio = \(\frac{2 \times 3!}{4!} = \frac{2 \times 6}{24} = \frac{1}{2}\). 
Answer:
<<<1/2>>>
