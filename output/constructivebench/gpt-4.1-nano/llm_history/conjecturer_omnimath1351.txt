Given the polynomial \( P = X^4 - 4X^3 - 4X^2 + 16X - 8 \), and recognizing the pattern from enumerated answers, the roots' magnitudes likely involve the constant term and polynomial coefficients. The pattern suggests the magnitude sum is proportional to \sqrt{2}. 

Final answer:
<<<(8) * (sqrt 2)>>>
