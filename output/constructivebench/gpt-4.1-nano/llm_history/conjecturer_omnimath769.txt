Since a is 0 or 1, and the recurrence mod 2 behaves periodically with period 60, the possible values are generated by initial states satisfying boundary conditions. From sequence examination, the combinations of (a 0, a 1, a 2) that satisfy the sum mod 2 recurrence and periodic boundary are {(0,0,0), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1)}. The corresponding 4 * a0 + 2 * a1 + a2 produce {0, 6, 5, 3}. The answer set is thus:

<<<{0, 3, 5, 6}>>>
