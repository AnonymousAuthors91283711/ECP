The pattern suggests the set includes integers greater than 0 that are coprime to all a(n) = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1 for n ≥ 1. Since each a(n) is divisible by 1, and coprime to x implies gcd x a(n) = 1, the common divisors are only 1. Thus, the set contains all positive integers coprime to all such expressions. But due to the specific form of a(n), the only positive number coprime to all a(n) is 1 itself.
