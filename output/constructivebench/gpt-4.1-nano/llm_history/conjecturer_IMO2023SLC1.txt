The pattern suggests the final set consists of pairs where min(m, n) = 2, reflecting the unique initial conditions and transformations. Since the initial state f 0 is all false and the process toggles certain pairs, the total set is all pairs when one dimension exceeds 2, but only specific pairs when both are exactly 2.  
Thus, the answer is the set of pairs (m, n) with min(m, n) = 2.
