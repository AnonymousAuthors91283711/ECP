The condition relates floor divisions, indicating a common divisibility pattern or a linear combination. Since the pattern involves 3, 5, 7, and their combinations, and given the structure of the floor formulas, the divisibility by their least common multiple (105) suggests the greatest N satisfying the condition.

The pattern in the enumerated answers (not fully shown) hints that the maximum N is 105, since it is the least common multiple where the conditions align.

<<<105>>>
