Given that f is a piecewise function with fixed points at 1 and 2, the iterates demonstrate a reflection about these points. The fixed points for f are x = 1 and x = 2, and iterative composition shows points map back to themselves after at most four iterations due to these fixed points. Thus, the set of fixed points under four iterations includes all x where f(x) is fixed or maps to a fixed point, which form the interval [1,2].

Since the set of fixed points has measure 1 (the interval [1,2]), and the preimages stabilize after 1 iteration, the total number of points with periodicity 1 or 4 under the iteration is the interval length.

Therefore, the answer is the measure of the fixed points:

<<<1>>>
