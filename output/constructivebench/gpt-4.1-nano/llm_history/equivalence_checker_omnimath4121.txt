Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 1 / x
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℚ => x^3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is a functional equation: ∀ x y : ℚ, 0 < x → 0 < y → f (f x^2 * y) = x^3 * f (x * y)

2. Ground truth answer is f(x) = 1/x
3. Proposed answer is f(x) = x³

Let's test the proposed answer:
For f(x) = x³, the left side becomes:
f(f(x)² * y) = f((x³)² * y) = f(x⁶ * y) = (x⁶ * y)³ = x¹⁸ * y³

The right side becomes:
x³ * f(x * y) = x³ * (x * y)³ = x³ * x³ * y³ = x⁶ * y³

These are not equal (x¹⁸ y³ ≠ x⁶ y³), so the proposed solution doesn't satisfy the equation.

The ground truth answer f(x) = 1/x does satisfy the equation:
Left side: f(f(x)² * y) = f((1/x)² * y) = f(y/x²) = x²/y
Right side: x³ * f(x * y) = x³ * (1/(x * y)) = x³/(x y) = x²/y

These are equal, so the ground truth is correct.
