Given the pattern of constraints, the number of such injective functions corresponds to the size of subsets of all pairs (i, j) with i, j ≤ n, and these subsets form partial functions. The maximum size is achieved by choosing all pairs where i ≠ j, i.e., a complete set of n×n pairs minus the diagonal, totaling n² - n. Thus, the greatest such k is n² - n.
