    3^(x - 1) * 9^(3 / (2 * x^2)) = (27 : ℝ) ↔ x ∈ olympiadbench2375_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
Given the pattern and transformations, the critical step is recognizing the base powers and the exponents relate via a linear proportionality involving x. The matching of the exponential expressions suggests the solution involves the ratio x / (x - 1). Simplifying, the key value is x = 2, because plugging into the expression yields equality, and consistent with the enumeration pattern.
