theorem P2021AMCB_23 :
  let prob (a b c : ℕ) : ℝ := (2 : ℝ)^(-(a : ℤ)) * (2 : ℝ)^(-(b : ℤ)) * (2 : ℝ)^(-(c : ℤ))
  let event (a b c : ℕ) : Prop := a < b ∧ b < c ∧ b - a = c - b ∧ a ≠ b ∧ b ≠ c
  let total_prob := ∑' a, ∑' b, ∑' c, if event a b c then prob a b c else 0
  ∃ (p q : ℕ), Nat.Coprime p q ∧ total_prob = p / q ∧ p / q = P2021AMCB_23_answer.1 / P2021AMCB_23_answer.2 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
The event requires an arithmetic progression of three distinct terms with b−a = c−b, which implies b is the arithmetic mean of a and c. The probabilities sum over all such triples, and symmetric distribution yields the sum as a geometric series. Computation shows the sum simplifies to 1/3.  
Therefore, the answer is (1, 3).  
<<<(1, 3)>>>
