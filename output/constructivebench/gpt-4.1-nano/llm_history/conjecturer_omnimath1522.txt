This problem involves Fibonacci numbers F, a sequence w related to F, and a boolean function p over Fin 15 such that the sum of w_i over p_i is equal to the sum over its complement. Since the total sum over all w_i is fixed, the only way these sums can be equal is if the sum over the selected subset and its complement are half of the total. The total sum is F(2) + ... + F(17). The total sum of Fibonacci numbers F_k from k=2 to 17 is known to be F(19) - 3, based on Fibonacci sum identities. The number of subsets with such a property corresponds to the number of ways to split the sequence into two parts with equal sum. For the entire sequence, the total sum is F(19)-3, which is odd, so no perfect partition exists, and the only solution set size is the largest ones when total sum is even, ultimately leading to half the sum solutions, i.e., 2^14. 

Therefore, the number of such p is 2^14.
