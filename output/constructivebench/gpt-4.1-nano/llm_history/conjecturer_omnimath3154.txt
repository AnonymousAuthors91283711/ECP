Given the pattern in enumerated answers and the nature of the problem (finding n between 1 and 100 such that n = m^2 - 5n^2), the solutions correspond to perfect squares where n = m^2 - 5 n^2 → n (1 + 5n) = m^2. Testing squares up to 100 yields solutions at n = 0, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100 with some satisfying the condition m^2 = n^3 + 5 n^2. Among these, only n with suitable m satisfy the equation. The subset of n in [1, 100] satisfying the condition are 4, 9, 25, 49, 81. Final answer: 

<<<4 + 5^2 + 25 + 49 + 81>>>
