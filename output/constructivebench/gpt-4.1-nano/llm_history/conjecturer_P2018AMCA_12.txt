The problem asks for the minimal number \(k\) such that there exists a subset \(S\) of \(\{1, 2, \dots, 12\}\) with 6 elements, pairwise non-dividing, and this \(k\) is the minimal such that this set exists.

By analysis, the minimal \(k\) is achieved by selecting 6 numbers with no divisibility relations within \(\{1,\dots,12\}\). The minimal number of such elements is 4 because for 6, there's a known subset with no divisibility pairs and size 6, but the minimal such \(k\) that satisfies the property in the entire set \(\{1,\dots,12\}\) is 7 as the minimal maximum element requiring non-divisibility constraints.

**Answer:**

<<<7>>>
