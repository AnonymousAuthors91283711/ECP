Based on the pattern and pattern analysis of the enumerated answers, the solution appears to relate to the maximum count of pairs with certain independence and determinant properties, reminiscent of the maximum number of mutually "coprime" pairs or a maximal set of pairs with unique determinants. Given the structure and the constraints, the best fit would be the total number of such pairs corresponds to the binomial coefficient, specifically related to choosing 2 elements from 100, which aligns with maximal pairings. 

Thus, the conjectured maximum N equals 4950, which is the number of pairs (i, j) with i < j in a set of 100 elements: 

<<<(100 * 99) / 2>>>
