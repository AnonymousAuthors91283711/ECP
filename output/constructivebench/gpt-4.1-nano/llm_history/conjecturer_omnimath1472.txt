abbrev omnimath1472_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1472 :
  (Real.tan (20 * (π / 180)) ^ 2 - Real.sin (20 * (π / 180)) ^ 2) / (Real.tan (20 * (π / 180)) ^ 2 * Real.sin (20 * (π / 180)) ^ 2) = omnimath1472_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the pattern and simplifying the trigonometric expression, the answer simplifies to a constant. The pattern suggests the value simplifies to 1. Hence, the final answer in Lean form is: 

<<<1>>>
