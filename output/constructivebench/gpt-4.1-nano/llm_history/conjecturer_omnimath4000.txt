The pattern suggests the functions are likely constant or linear solutions, often testable with substitutions. The pattern in enumerations points to constant functions, specifically \(f(x) = 0\) and \(f(x) = 1\). These satisfy the functional equation by substitution checking, as both simplify the equation suitably.
