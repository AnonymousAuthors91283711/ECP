  IsLeast {n : ℕ | n > 0 ∧ SteveMoney n > WayneMoney n ∧ ∀ (k : ℕ), k < n → SteveMoney k ≤ WayneMoney k} omnimath3498_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the minimal n where SteveMoney n > WayneMoney n and for all k < n, SteveMoney k ≤ WayneMoney k is likely to be at n=1, since higher n depend on previous k's which do not satisfy the inequality.

Thus, the minimal such n is 1, provided that SteveMoney 1 > WayneMoney 1 (which fits the pattern for the smallest case). To generalize, we can define it as the least n ≥ 1 satisfying the conditions.
