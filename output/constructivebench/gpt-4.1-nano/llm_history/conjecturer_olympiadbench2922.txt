The pattern suggests the answer is the product of the four variables, with respective values replacing the variables derived from the sums. Given the sums of squares, common Pythagorean triples imply A=2√5, R=2√5, M=√10, L=√10, and their product simplifies to 20. But since variables are positive, the product simplifies to the integer 20.

Therefore, the answer is 20.
