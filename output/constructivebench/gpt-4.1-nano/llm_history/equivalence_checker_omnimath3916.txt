Ground Truth Answer: fun a d => ⌈(log a d : ℝ)⌉₊
Proposed Answer: fun a d => (a - 1) / d
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is about finding the greatest power of a that divides any term in a recursively defined sequence xₖ, where the sequence behavior depends on whether a divides the previous term.

2. The ground truth answer suggests this is related to the ceiling of the logarithm of d with base a, converted to a natural number. This makes sense as it relates to how many times we can divide by a before the sequence stops being divisible by a.

3. The proposed answer suggests (a-1)/d, which is completely different in nature:
   - It's a linear expression rather than logarithmic
   - For a=2, d=3: ground truth would be ⌈log₂3⌉=2, while proposed gives (2-1)/3≈0.33 (truncated to 0)
   - For a=3, d=2: ground truth ⌈log₃2⌉=1, proposed (3-1)/2=1 (this coincidentally matches)
   - For a=5, d=2: ground truth ⌈log₅2⌉=1, proposed (5-1)/2=2

The answers give different results in most cases and have fundamentally different forms. The proposed answer doesn't capture the logarithmic nature of the problem.
