Ground Truth Answer: fun _ => 0
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℝ × ℝ => (p.1 + p.2) / 2
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is asking for a function f that sums to zero on any unit square.

2. The ground truth answer is the zero function (fun _ => 0), which clearly sums to zero on any unit square.

3. The proposed answer is (fun p : ℝ × ℝ => (p.1 + p.2) / 2), which is a linear function of the coordinates.

For the proposed answer to work, the sum of (x+y)/2 over any unit square vertices must be zero. However, consider a unit square at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1):
Sum would be (0+0)/2 + (1+0)/2 + (1+1)/2 + (0+1)/2 = 0 + 0.5 + 1 + 0.5 = 2 ≠ 0.

Therefore, the proposed answer does not satisfy the condition, while the ground truth does.
