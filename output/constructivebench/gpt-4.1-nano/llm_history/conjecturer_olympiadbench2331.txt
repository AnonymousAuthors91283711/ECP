The pattern in the enumerated solutions suggests a quadratic in terms of x, with coefficients derived from the relationship involving g and f. Given g(x) = 2x - 4, solving for f π involves substituting and simplifying to obtain a quadratic form. The final explicit form, consistent with the pattern, is a quadratic expression in π with specific coefficients. 

Hence, the answer, simplifying accordingly, is:

<<<(π ^ 2) + 6 * π + 25>>>
