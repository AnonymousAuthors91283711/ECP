Ground Truth Answer: 23
Proposed Answer:  43 - 3 - 17
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is about binomial coefficients and their symmetry properties. We know that C(n,k) = C(n,n-k).

2. Given T=43, we're looking at C(40,17) = C(40,n) where n>0 and n≠17.

3. By the symmetry property, C(40,17) = C(40,23) since 40-17=23.

4. The proposed answer is 43-3-17 = 23, which matches the ground truth answer.

5. The calculation is correct: 43-3=40, then 40-17=23.

The proposed answer correctly applies the symmetry property of binomial coefficients and arrives at the same solution as the ground truth answer, just expressed in a different (but equivalent) form.
