Ground Truth Answer: ∅
Proposed Answer: { n | 2001 * 2003 ∣ n }
Let me analyze this problem carefully.

The problem is asking to find all natural numbers n > 0 where Euler's totient function φ(n) equals 2002² - 1. The ground truth answer is the empty set ∅, meaning no such numbers exist.

The proposed answer suggests the set {n | 2001 * 2003 divides n}. Let's evaluate:

1. First, note that 2002² - 1 = (2002-1)(2002+1) = 2001 * 2003
2. The totient function φ(n) for n = k*(2001*2003) would be φ(k)*φ(2001)*φ(2003) if gcd conditions are met
3. However, φ(2001*2003) would be much larger than 2001*2003 itself (since 2001 and 2003 are coprime)
4. There's no way φ(n) could equal exactly 2001*2003 for any n, since φ(n) for n divisible by 2001*2003 would be at least φ(2001*2003) > 2001*2003

The proposed answer incorrectly suggests there are solutions, while the ground truth correctly states there are none. Therefore:

<<<False>>>
