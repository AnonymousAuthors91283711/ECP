abbrev omnimath3372_answer : ℕ → Rat := sorry
theorem omnimath3372 (n : ℕ) (hn : n ≠ 0) : 
  (1 / n) = omnimath3372_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (1 / (2 * n)) + (1 / (3 * n)) + (1 / (6 * n))
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (n : Rat)⁻¹
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find a function that equals 1/n for all non-zero natural numbers n.

2. Ground Truth Answer: 
   (1/(2n)) + (1/(3n)) + (1/(6n)) = (3/(6n)) + (2/(6n)) + (1/(6n)) = 6/(6n) = 1/n
   This correctly equals 1/n for all n ≠ 0.

3. Proposed Answer:
   fun n : ℕ => (n : Rat)⁻¹
   This is exactly the definition of 1/n (since ⁻¹ is the multiplicative inverse in Rat).

Both answers are mathematically equivalent to 1/n for all n ≠ 0. The ground truth answer shows an explicit decomposition, while the proposed answer is the direct definition.
