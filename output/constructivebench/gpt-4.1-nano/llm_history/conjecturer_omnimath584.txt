  (x a : ℝ)
  (hseq : ∃ c : ℝ, (20 + c = x) ∧ (50 + c = a * x) ∧ (100 + c = a ^ 2 * x)) :

The relations imply: x - 20 = c, a * x - 50 = c, a² * x - 100 = c. Subtract first from second: (a * x) - x = 30; factor gives x(a - 1) = 30. Similarly, subtract first from third: a² * x - x = 80; factor as x(a² - 1) = 80. Using the first, express x as (c + 20). The key is that a satisfies quadratic derived from these relations; solving yields a = 2 or a = 4, and both satisfy the relations. The consistent, generalized solution for a is 4.
