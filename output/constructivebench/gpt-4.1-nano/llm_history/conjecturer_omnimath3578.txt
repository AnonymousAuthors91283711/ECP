Given the pattern of the enumerated answers, the proof constraints, and the structure of the problem, the solution seems to involve relations where *a, b, c* sum to *n* and their gcd properties relate directly to *n*, potentially with the gcd equal to 1, suggesting that *n* must be a positive integer with specific divisibility properties. The consistent pattern with the enumerated solutions indicates that *n* should be a positive integer that can be expressed as a sum of three positive integers with pairwise gcd 1 conditions, specifically those where *n* itself is the sum of three positive integers with pairwise gcd 1. As these all qualify, I'm generalizing to all such *n*. 

Thus, the set of *n* is exactly all positive integers greater than 2, because the smallest sum of three positive integers with gcd 1 constraints is 3 (e.g., 1+1+1).
