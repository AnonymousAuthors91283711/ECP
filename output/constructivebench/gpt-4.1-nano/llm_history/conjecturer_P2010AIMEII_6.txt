The problem involves finding the least positive integer \( n \) such that there exist polynomials \( P, Q \) over \(\mathbb{Z}\) with degrees greater than 0, satisfying specific coefficient conditions: \( (PQ).coeff 4 = 1 \) and \( (PQ).coeff 1 = -n + 63 \).

Analyzing the pattern of the coefficients, the smallest positive \( n \) occurs when these constraints are simultaneously satisfied with minimal \( n \).

Given the enumerated pattern, the minimal \( n \) satisfying these relations appears to be \( 60 \).

Thus, expressed cleanly in Lean notation:

<<<60>>>
