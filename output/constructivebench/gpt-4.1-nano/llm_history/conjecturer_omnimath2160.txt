The pattern in enumerated answers suggests the maximum k when each of the 2019 voters has a unique vote in an N-sized set. The maximum possible size occurs when each voter has a distinct "party" (value). Since votes are injective per voter, k is bounded by the total number of such distinct "party" options and the total voters.

Therefore, the greatest such k is 2019, achieved when each voter has a unique vote.
