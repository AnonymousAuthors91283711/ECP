Given n = 7, the constraints suggest the answer is related to properties of 7 and related expressions. The only answer consistent separately with all the conditions (evenness/oddness) is 63 (which is 9 * 7), it's odd, and 7^2=49 (odd), 7*(7-2)=35 (odd). For the given conditions, the product 7*9=63. Using the pattern, the answer appears to involve 7 * 9 = 63.
