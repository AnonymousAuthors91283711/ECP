This pattern follows a recurrence: a n = 5 a(n-1)+4, with a base a₀. The solution: a n = (a₀ - 1) * 5^n + 1. Ensuring a 54 is divisible by 2013, choose a₀ so that 2013 divides ((a₀ - 1) * 5^54 + 1). To emphasize a concrete form, the key constraining solution involves 2013 dividing (a₀ - 1) * 5^54 + 1, leading to the explicit form in the answer.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The issue arises because in the snippet `abbrev omnimath4424_answer : Prop := sorry`, the variable `a₀` is used inside, but `a₀` is not in scope for the definition of `omnimath4424_answer`. The problem states that `a₀ : ℕ` is a parameter in `omnimath4424`, but it is not included in the definition of `omnimath4424_answer`. 

To correctly connect the existence statement to the parameter `a₀`, the definition of `omnimath4424_answer` should be a *parameterized* proposition, i.e., depend on the particular `a₀`. In Lean, this can be achieved by defining a `Prop` that is a *function* taking `a₀ : ℕ` as input: 

```lean
abbrev omnimath4424_answer (a₀ : ℕ) : Prop := ...
```

Then, the theorem explicitly involves `a₀` and the statement:

```lean
(∃ a : ℕ → ℕ, a 0 = a₀ ∧ (∀ n ≥ 1, a n = 5 * a (n - 1) + 4) ∧ a 54 = 2013*5^44) 
↔ omnimath4424_answer a₀
```

is well-formed, because `a₀` appears unambiguously.

Based on the recurrence \(a_n = 5a_{n-1} + 4\) with initial condition \(a_0=a_0\), this is a first-order linear recurrence relation. The general solution is:

\[a_n = A \cdot 5^n - 1\]

for some constant \(A\). Using the initial condition:

\[
a_0 = A \cdot 5^0 - 1 = A - 1 = a_0 \quad \Rightarrow A = a_0 + 1
\]

Thus,

\[
a_n = (a_0 + 1) \cdot 5^n - 1
\]

The divisibility condition:

\[
2013 \mid a_{54} = (a_0 + 1) \cdot 5^{54} - 1
\]

implies:

\[
2013 \mid (a_0 + 1) \cdot 5^{54} - 1
\]

which is equivalent to:

\[
(a_0 + 1) \cdot 5^{54} \equiv 1 \pmod{2013}
\]

Since 2013 is fixed, for some \(a_0\), the relation becomes:

\[
a_0 + 1 \equiv 5^{-54} \pmod{2013}
\]

assuming 5 is invertible modulo 2013 (which is true if gcd(5, 2013)=1). Computing gcd:

\[
2013 = 3 \times 11 \times 61
\]

Since 5 is coprime with 2013, 5 is invertible modulo 2013. By Euler's theorem:

\[
5^{\varphi(2013)} \equiv 1 \pmod{2013}
\]

where \(\varphi(2013) = (3-1)(11-1)(61-1) = 2 \times 10 \times 60 = 1200\). However, 54 divides 1200 yields a residue:

\[
5^{54} \equiv \text{some residue modulo } 2013
\]

But, the explicit calculation isn't necessary if we are just expressing the solution set general formally.

Therefore, the full expression of the initial value corresponds to:

\[
a_0 = (5^{-54} \bmod 2013) - 1
\]

where \(5^{-54} \bmod 2013\) denotes the modular inverse of \(5^{54}\) mod 2013.

**Final Corrected Lean statement:**

<<<
∀ a₀ > 0, (2013 ∣ ( (a₀ + 1) * 5^54 - 1 )) ↔ ∃ k : ℕ, (a₀ + 1) ≡ k * (5^54)⁻¹ ∧ 0 < a₀
>>>
  
**Justification:**

- The solution set is characterized by \(a_0\) satisfying \((a_0+1) \equiv 5^{-54} \pmod{2013}\).
- The recurrence defines every \(a_n\) in terms of \(a_0\), confirming the divisibility condition reduces to a unique modular equation.
- The general form for solutions can thus be written in a "closed form" coming from the modular inverse relation, matching typical algebraic solutions to linear recurrences with divisibility constraints.

**Explanation Summary:**

This formulation captures the structure of the solution set in a clean, closed-form modular expression, suitable for Lean formalization.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The main issue in the proposed answer is the use of the inverse notation `(5^54)⁻¹` in a ring where this inverse may not exist as an element; in particular, in ℕ, `⁻¹` is not defined. Since the problem involves divisibility and linear recurrence relations, the key is to relate the sequence `a n` to a geometric form involving powers of 5, and to represent the divisibility condition in terms of integer congruences without the inverse. 

Based on the pattern in the enumerated answer, the solution involves recognizing that `a n` follows a recurrence solution of the form `a n = A * 5^n + B`. Using initial conditions, the constants are determined, and divisibility conditions translate into conditions on `a₀ + 1` and `5^54`, without needing to invert `5^54`.

The proposed answer should be a statement relating `a₀`, the initial value, to a divisibility involving `a₀ + 1` and powers of `5`, specifically that `(a₀ + 1)` multiplied by a power gives the same divisibility condition.

**Key insight**: The correct divisibility condition involves `(a₀ + 1) * 5^{54} - 1` being divisible by 2013, relating to the geometric sum pattern, because the recurrence's explicit form can be derived as `a n = C * 5^n - 1`, for some integer `C`.

**Corrected answer in Lean:**

<<<
∀ a₀ > 0, (2013 ∣ ( (a₀ + 1) * 5^54 - 1 )) ↔ ∃ c : ℤ, a₀ = c * 5^0 - 0 ∧ 2013 ∣ ( (a₀ + 1) * 5^54 - 1 )
>>>

But more precisely, since `a₀` is initial value and the sequence satisfies `a n = c * 5^n - 1`, the divisibility condition reduces to `2013 ∣ ( (a₀ + 1) * 5^54 - 1 )`.

So the answer simplifies to:

<<<
(∃ a : ℤ, a₀ = a) ∧ 2013 ∣ ( (a + 1) * 5^54 - 1 )
>>>

which properly avoids undefined inverse and maintains the logical equivalence.

**Final final answer (compact form):**

<<<
(a₀ > 0) ∧ (2013 ∣ ( (a₀ + 1) * 5^54 - 1 ))>>
