Given the equations and the symmetry in a and b, the solutions satisfy quadratic relations that lead to specific real solutions. From the pattern in enumeration, the solutions are points where a and b satisfy certain algebraic conditions. The pattern hints at solutions representing points on the circle \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\) scaled appropriately, with the specific solutions involving the points (1, 4/5) and (-1, -4/5). Thus, the final set includes these pairs. 

<<<{(a, b) : ℂ × ℂ | (a = 1 ∧ b = 4/5) ∨ (a = -1 ∧ b = -4/5)}>>>
