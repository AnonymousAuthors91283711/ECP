Ground Truth Answer: 2 ^ 2013 - 6036
Proposed Answer: 2012 * 2^(2011) + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recurrence relation:
   - Base cases: x₁ = 1, x₂ = 2
   - Recurrence: xₙ₊₂ = 2xₙ₊₁ - xₙ + 2ⁿ for n ≥ 1

2. The ground truth answer is 2²⁰¹³ - 6036

3. The proposed answer is 2012 * 2²⁰¹¹ + 1

Let's compare these numerically for smaller values to check consistency:

For n=3 (should be x₃):
- Ground truth would give 2⁴ - 12 = 4
- Proposed would give 3*2² + 1 = 13
But calculating x₃ from recurrence:
x₃ = 2x₂ - x₁ + 2¹ = 4 - 1 + 2 = 5
Neither matches, but the ground truth formula appears to be offset by n.

Actually, the correct solution should be:
xₙ = 2ⁿ⁺¹ - 2n
For n=3: 2⁴ - 6 = 10 (still doesn't match x₃=5)
Wait, perhaps the ground truth is for x_(n+1)?

Alternatively, let's check n=2012:
Ground truth: 2²⁰¹³ - 6036
Proposed: 2012*2²⁰¹¹ + 1 = 1006*2²⁰¹² + 1 ≈ 0.5*2²⁰¹³
These are clearly different orders of magnitude.

The proposed answer is incorrect.
