The pattern in the enumerated answers suggests a simplification involving ratio of powers, possibly related to the sum and difference of powers with exponents 2014 and 2012. Recognizing that (2^2014 + 2^2012) / (2^2014 - 2^2012) simplifies with common factor 2^2012, the expression reduces to (4 + 1)/(4 - 1) = 5/3.

Hence, the closed form is 5/3.

The current proposal attempts to define `P2013AMCA_4_answer` as `sorry`, but in Lean, an identifier cannot be assigned a descriptive comment or explanation directly after the colon in a `noncomputable abbrev`. Instead, the correct approach is to directly define `P2013AMCA_4_answer` as the simplified rational number `(5 : ℝ) / 3`, enclosing it within the `<<< ... >>>` delimiters as specified.

Given the algebraic simplification:

\[
\frac{2^{2014} + 2^{2012}}{2^{2014} - 2^{2012}}
\]

factor out \(2^{2012}\):

\[
\frac{2^{2012} (2^{2} + 1)}{2^{2012} (2^{2} - 1)} = \frac{4 + 1}{4 - 1} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

This provides a neat closed-form answer in rational form.

The corrected Lean definition should be:

Given the problem involves algebraic expressions with powers of 2 and the target is to find a closed form for the expression \((2^{2014} + 2^{2012}) / (2^{2014} - 2^{2012})\), it's natural to factor and simplify this ratio algebraically.

Notice that \( 2^{2014} = 2^{2012} \times 2^2 = 4 \times 2^{2012} \). Let's factor \( 2^{2012} \) out numerator and denominator:

\[ \frac{2^{2012} \times 4 + 2^{2012}}{2^{2012} \times 4 - 2^{2012}} = \frac{2^{2012} (4 + 1)}{2^{2012} (4 - 1)} = \frac{5}{3}. \]

This is a simple constant value, and the expression simplifies to the rational number \(\frac{5}{3}\). 

In Lean syntax, the resulting expression should be written directly as a rational \(\frac{5}{3}\), which is represented as `(5 : ℝ) / 3`.

The initial error occurs because the placeholder `...` is invalid syntax; Lean expects a term of type ℝ, not placeholder dots. Hence, the correct form is a well-formed Lean expression: `(5 : ℝ) / 3`.

**Final Answer (enclosed with delimiters):**

<<<(5 : ℝ) / 3>>>

**Explanation:**  
The algebraic manipulation reduces the ratio to \(\frac{5}{3}\), a simple rational number in ℝ. Passing this value directly as the value of \( P2013AMCA_4_answer \) is consistent with the problem's algebraic structure and the requirement for a closed-form answer.
