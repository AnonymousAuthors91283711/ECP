The pattern suggests counting the maximum number of disjoint pairs of subsets with the given intersection properties, constrained by k and n. Observing the enumeration, the critical factor aligns with partitioning n into groups of size k, with additional combinatorial considerations.

Given these, the conjectured maximal value is n choose k, accounting for the ways to select the initial subset B i, and the number of subsets C i, which can be nested within B i, leading to a simplified closed form as this count.

Final answer:
<<<fun n k => Nat.choose n k>>>
