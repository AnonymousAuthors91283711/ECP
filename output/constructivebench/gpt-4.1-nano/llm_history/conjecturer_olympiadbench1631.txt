  IsGreatest {k : ℕ | ∃ (a : ℕ), 0 < a ∧ ∀ n ∈ Icc 1 k, Nat.Prime (2^(x a n) - 1)} olympiadbench1631_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern in the enumerated answers suggests the greatest k corresponds to the case when a = 1, leading to the sequence of Mersenne primes (2^{2^n} - 1). The sequence's maximum is approached at a = 1, with n running from 1 to a certain maximum. Therefore, the answer simplifies to 2^{2^1} - 1 = 3, representing the first Mersenne prime.
