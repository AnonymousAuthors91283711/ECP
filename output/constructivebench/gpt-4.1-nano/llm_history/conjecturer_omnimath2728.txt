The pattern suggests a focus on specific divisibility conditions for small values within the interval 1 to 10. Since a^2014 + a^2015 factors as a^2014(a+1), and divisibility by 5 depends on a and a+1 modulo 5, only a ≡ 4 mod 5 in [1,10] satisfy the divisibility. There are 2 such values (a=4,9).

The problem involves counting elements \(a \in \{1, \dots, 10\}\) such that \(5 \mid a^{2014} + a^{2015}\). Recognizing that \(a^{2014} + a^{2015} = a^{2014}(a + 1)\), divisibility by 5 depends on when either \(a \equiv 0 \pmod 5\) or \(\,a+1 \equiv 0 \pmod 5\). Since \(a \in [1,10]\), those are the cases where:

- \(a \equiv 0 \pmod 5 \implies a = 5, 10\),
- \(a + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod 5 \implies a = 4, 9\).

This yields four elements: \(a=4,5,9,10\). All satisfy the divisibility condition. The total count: 4.

Because the question asks for the *encard* (size) of the set, the answer is 4.

The initial Lean code and error indicate a syntax problem with using 'to' instead of 'in' in set notation, and the answer value should match the count of such elements.

Thus, the fixed expression is:

<<<4>>>

This is a concise, closed-form answer based on combinational divisibility reasoning, suitable for formalization.
