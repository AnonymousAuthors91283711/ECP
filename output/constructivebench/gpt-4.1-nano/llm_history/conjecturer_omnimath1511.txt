The pattern indicates the answer involves the minimal sum where the conditions are satisfied with the existence of integer \(k\) matching the square root relation. The non-negativity and minimality suggest the smallest positive integers satisfying \(a \neq b \neq c\) and \(k = \sqrt{a \sqrt{b \sqrt{c}}}\), which yields the minimal non-zero solution at \((a, b, c) = (1, 2, 3)\), as these are smallest distinct positive integers satisfying the given relation for some \(k\). The sum is thus \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\).
