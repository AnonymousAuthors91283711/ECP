The minimal sum of multiset s with elements 10 ≤ n < 100 summing to 2024. Likely, the answer involves the least number of such elements, possibly all equal (since sum is fixed). Using uniform elements around 20, the sum/element ≈ 2024/~20 ≈ 101, which is outside the range. 

Choosing 20's: 20 * 101 = 2020, close to 2024, we need 4 more. Adjusting with fewer elements can reduce sum to the minimal number of elements.

Simplest to pick all elements as 20 then replace some with 24 to reach exact sum with minimal count:

Number of 20's: (2024 - 4) / 20 = 201, then add one element 24 to sum to 2024, total elements = 201 + 1 = 202.

Thus, the minimal number of elements:
