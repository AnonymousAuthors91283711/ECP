Ground Truth Answer: 46
Proposed Answer: 360
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting possible configurations of flipping two coins (from 10 coins) where:
   - First flip turns one coin from true to false
   - Second flip toggles another coin's state (could be same or different)

2. The ground truth answer is 46, which makes sense because:
   - There are 10 choices for the first coin to flip (set to false)
   - For each first choice, there are 9 remaining coins to toggle
   - Plus 1 option to toggle the same coin again (which would set it back to true)
   - Total: 10 × (9 + 1) = 100
   - But we must subtract duplicates where the order of flipping is reversed
   - Actual unique configurations: (10 × 9)/2 + 10 = 45 + 1 = 46

3. The proposed answer is 360, which appears to be 10 × 9 × 4 (but this doesn't match the problem's requirements)

The proposed answer is incorrect as it overcounts the configurations and doesn't account for the problem's specific conditions.
