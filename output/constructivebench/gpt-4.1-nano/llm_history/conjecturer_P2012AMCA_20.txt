The polynomial coefficient expansion involves choosing exponents summing to 2012 in 8 parts, each from 0 to 7, corresponding to a multinomial distribution. The dominant contribution occurs when the exponents are around 2012/8 ≈ 251.5, so the coefficient counts solutions with sum of $\leq$ 7 per term, ensuring the total sum is 2012, which is divisibility aligned with the expansion. The structure suggests the answer proportional to 2012 divide by 4 (since the total degree is 8 * 7 = 56, and 2012 is divisible by 4). The pattern shows that the sum of the coefficients equals $2^{ \lfloor \frac{2012}{4} \rfloor }$. 

Thus, the answer is: 

<<<2012 / 4>>>
