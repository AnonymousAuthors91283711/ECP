Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1, 3, 1)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1, 1, 1)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation to solve is: 20^x + 14^(2*y) = (x + 2*y + z)^(z*t)
2. All variables x, y, z, t are positive natural numbers (hx, hy, hz, ht conditions)
3. Ground truth claims only (1,1,3,1) satisfies the equation
4. Proposed answer claims (1,1,1,1) satisfies the equation

Let's test both solutions:

For ground truth (1,1,3,1):
20^1 + 14^(2*1) = 20 + 196 = 216
(1 + 2*1 + 3)^(3*1) = 6^3 = 216
This satisfies the equation.

For proposed answer (1,1,1,1):
20^1 + 14^(2*1) = 20 + 196 = 216
(1 + 2*1 + 1)^(1*1) = 4^1 = 4
216 ≠ 4, so this doesn't satisfy the equation.

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the given equation.
