Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => (Nat.choose 10 5 - Nat.choose (x + y) x * Nat.choose (10 - x - y) (5 - x)) / 36
Proposed Answer: fun x y => (choose 10 5 - choose (x + y) x * choose (10 - x - y) (5 - x)) / 36
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. The only difference is the use of `choose` instead of `Nat.choose`, but in Lean, `choose` is just a shorthand for `Nat.choose`. The expressions and structure are identical, and the division by 36 is correctly placed in both cases. The constraints `x ≤ 5` and `y ≤ 5` are part of the theorem statement but don't affect the form of the answer itself.
