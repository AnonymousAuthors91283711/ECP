Based on pattern and enumeration, the answer should be a polynomial matching the differences at points, which suggest the polynomial is quadratic. The polynomial interpolates points (-4, -1, 4). The closed form is derived from Lagrange interpolation over roots 1, 2, 3, matching pattern of difference and symmetry. Hence the polynomial is the quadratic:
