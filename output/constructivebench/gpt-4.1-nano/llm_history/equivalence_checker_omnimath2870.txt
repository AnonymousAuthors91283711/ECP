abbrev omnimath2870_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath2870 : omnimath2870_answer = 11/120 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: (1/12 + 1/10) / 2
Proposed Answer: (11 : ℚ) / 120
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer: (1/12 + 1/10) / 2
   - First calculate 1/12 + 1/10 = 5/60 + 6/60 = 11/60
   - Then divide by 2: (11/60)/2 = 11/120

2. Proposed Answer: 11/120

The two expressions evaluate to the same rational number. The proposed answer is simply the simplified form of the ground truth answer.
