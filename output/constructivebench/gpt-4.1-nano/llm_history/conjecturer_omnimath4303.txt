theorem omnimath4303 : 
  (¬∃ (k n : ℤ), k^3 = 3 * n^2 + 3 * n + 7) ↔ omnimath4303_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Prop
Given the pattern of the enumeration and the nature of the equation \(k^3 = 3n^2 + 3n + 7\), the problem asks whether such integers exist. The form suggests that for all integer \(k, n\), the equation has no solutions, and thus the statement is equivalent to stating that no such \(k, n\) exist. The answer should be a universally true statement about the impossibility of solutions.

<<<¬∃ (k n : ℤ), k^3 = 3 * n^2 + 3 * n + 7>>>
