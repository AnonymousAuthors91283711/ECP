The divisibility condition simplifies to the case when a=1, since for larger a, the divisibility becomes more restrictive. The pattern suggests the answer is roughly the proportion of triples where the product plus sum is divisible by 3, which is 1/3, adjusted by the density. Based on enumeration, the answer approaches 1/3:

<<<(1 : ℚ) / 3>>>
