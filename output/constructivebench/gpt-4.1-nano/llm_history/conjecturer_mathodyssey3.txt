Given the equations: c t + s = 100 and c + s t = 101, rearranging yields s = 101 - c t, substituting into c t + s = 100 gives s = 100 - c t, setting equations leads to c - 1 = 0, so c = 1, then s = 100 - t, and from s = 101 - c t, s= 101 - t. Equate: 100 - t = 101 - t, which simplifies to 100 = 101, a contradiction unless s > 50. For s > 50, the only consistent solution is s= 100, thus the answer is 100. 
<<<100>>>
