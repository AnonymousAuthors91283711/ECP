The problem involves three digits \( h, t, u > 0 \) defining a number \( n = 100h +10t + u \), with the property that \( m \) divisible by \( n \) implies \( m = n k \) for some \( k \). The elements are multiples of \( n \) with the same \( h, t, u \) pattern, so the sum over such \( n \) is the sum over these minimal representatives. The set contains numbers \( n \) with \( h, t, u \) nonzero; sum over their minimal multiples.

This simplifies to summing all three-digit numbers with digits \( h,t,u>0 \) that are minimal in their class. The sum of all such \( n \) is the sum over all \( h,t,u >0 \) of \( 100h + 10 t + u \).

The sum of all \( h, t, u \) from 1 to 9:

\[
\sum_{h=1}^9 \sum_{t=1}^9 \sum_{u=1}^9 (100h + 10t + u) = 9^3 \times \left( 100 \cdot \frac{9+1}{2} + 10 \cdot \frac{9+1}{2} + \frac{9+1}{2} \right).
\]

Calculates to:

\[
729 \times (100 \times 5 + 10 \times 5 + 5) = 729 \times (500 +50 + 5) = 729 \times 555.
\]

Final sum:

\[
729 \times 555.
\]

In Lean:

<<<(729) * 555>>>
