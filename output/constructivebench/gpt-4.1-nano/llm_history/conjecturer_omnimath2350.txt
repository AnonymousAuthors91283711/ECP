theorem omnimath2350 :
  (∑ n in Finset.range 4096, countTransitions (digits 2 n) : ℚ) / 4096 = omnimath2350_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The pattern of counting transitions in base 2 digits over 0 to 4095 (which are 12 bits) suggests that, on average, half the adjacent digit pairs differ, i.e., the expected number of transitions per number is 6. Therefore, the total sum over all 4096 numbers should be close to 4096 * 6 = 24576, giving an average of 6. As a rational number, this is 6/1.

<<<6 / 1>>>
