Given the polynomial \(x^2 + x + 41\), it is well-known that for positive integers \(x\), this expression produces prime numbers for a substantial range but eventually yields composite numbers. The smallest positive \(x\) making the expression composite is \(x=40\), where \(40^2 + 40 + 41 = 1681 = 41^2\). Thus, the least such \(x\) is 40, and \(x^2 + x + 41\) is composite precisely at \(x=40\). The minimal positive \(x\) satisfying the condition is 40.
