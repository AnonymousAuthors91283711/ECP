The pattern suggests solutions are affine functions, f(x) = c * x + d, satisfying the given functional equation. Eliminating the existential, we propose the answer: all functions of the form f(x) = (1 / a) * x + c, with c ∈ ℚ, fit the property, satisfying the linearity condition derived from the equation.
