Given the equation \(k^2 = m^2 + 6m + 28\), rewrite as \(k^2 = (m+3)^2 + 19\), so \(k^2 - (m+3)^2 = 19\). Factor as \((k - m - 3)(k + m + 3) = 19\). Since 19 is prime, pairs are \(\pm 1, \pm 19\). These yield \(k - m - 3\) and \(k + m + 3\) as \(\pm 1\) or \(\pm 19\). Solving gives specific \(m\) and \(k\) as integer solutions. The set of \(m\) corresponds to all integers where these pairs multiply to 19, specifically when \(k- m - 3\) and \(k + m + 3\) are \(\pm 1, \pm 19\). Final summarized form: <<<{m ∈ ℤ | (m + 3)^2 - 19 is a perfect square}>>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The main issue in the proposed answer is the use of "is a perfect square" as a predicate, which is not directly recognized by Lean's core logic. Instead, you should express "is a perfect square" using the predicate that a number is a square of some integer. For example, `∃ x : ℤ, x^2 = ...`.

The current answer uses the expression `(m + 3)^2 - 19 is a perfect square`, which missing the explicit existential quantifier. To fix this, we should define the set as those `m` such that `(m + 3)^2 - 19` equals `x^2` for some `x : ℤ`. 

Furthermore, the expression `{m ∈ ℤ | ...}` directly resembles set notation, but in Lean, to construct a set of `ℤ`, we usually use `Set.filter` or `{m : ℤ | ...}` syntax which is correct, but the predicate must be properly formed.

Given the enumerated answers and the pattern observed, the correct form is:

```lean
{m : ℤ | ∃ x : ℤ, (m + 3)^2 - 19 = x^2}
```

This correctly states that `m` belongs to `omnimath546_answer` iff `(m + 3)^2 - 19` is a perfect square, expressed explicitly via an existential.

Final, fixed version:

<<<{m : ℤ | ∃ x : ℤ, (m + 3)^2 - 19 = x^2}>>>
