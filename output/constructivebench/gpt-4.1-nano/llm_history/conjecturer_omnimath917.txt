The problem describes the number of functions from a finite set with bounds, with bounded consecutive differences. Recognizing the structure as similar to counting lattice paths with step constraints, the total count resembles a combinatorial pattern roughly proportional to \( (n+1)^{n} \) for large \( n \). Given the enumeration hints, the count for \( |f i - f ((i + 1) % 2002)| \le 2 \) resembles \( 3^{n} \).

Hence, a closed-form, generalized for \( n = 2002 \),
