The problem asks for the smallest \(b\) such that \(b > 1\) and \(1 + b + b^2 + b^3\) is a perfect square. Testing small \(b\), we find \(b=2 \Power 1\) yields \(1+2+4+8=15\) (not a perfect square), but \(b=3\) gives \(1+3+9+27=40\) (not a perfect square), and \(b=4\) gives \(1+4+16+64=85\) (not a perfect square), while for \(b=5\), \(1+5+25+125=156\) (not). For \(b = 6\), sum is 210, not square; \(b=7\), sum 280; but at \(b=8\), sum equals \(1+8+64+512=585\), not a perfect square. At \(b=9\), sum is 819, not a perfect square. At \(b=10\), sum is 139, not a square. For \(b=11\), total 163, no. For \(b=12\), sum is 205 again, no. At \(b=13\), sum is 266, no. At \(b=14\), sum is 341, no. At \(b=15\), sum is 406, no. At \(b=16\), sum is \(1 + 16 + 256 + 4096 = 4369\), no. At \(b=17\), sum is 4685, no. 

However, trying \(b= 24\), the sum is \(1 + 24 + 576 + (24)^3= 1+24+576+ 13824= 14425\), which appears not to be square. We suspect the pattern may involve perfect squares at \(b= 4\) or 6? Testing smaller leads reveals no solution. 

The pattern suggests that the smallest such \(b\) might be \(b= 7\), as the check for small \(b\) does not yield a square, and the problem is to find the minimal. Given the limited pattern, the minimal \(b>1\) with the sum being a perfect square is at \(b = 3\), but sum is 40, not a square, so discard.

Therefore, the minimal \(b\) that makes the sum a perfect square is \(b= 3\), but sum is 40, which is not a square. Or perhaps \(b= 24\) as a standard candidate? The pattern suggests that the minimal value is near 4. Given the enumerated answers, let's infer it from pattern.

The only perfect square in the sum for small \(b\) occurs at \(b= 7\), when \(1+7+49+343= 400=20^2\). Confirmed: sum is 400, which is a perfect square.

Thus, the minimal \(b\) is 7. 

Final answer in line with the pattern:

<<<7>>>
