  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∃ (k m : ℕ), 
    5 * m = 12 * k ∧ 
    11 * (m + 50) = 25 * (k + 50) ∧ 
    n = k + 50} 
  P2022AIMEII_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The two equations relate \(5m=12k\) and \(11(m+50)=25(k+50)\). Solving these simultaneously yields \(k=30\). Then, \(n=k+50=80\). The minimal \(n\) satisfying conditions is thus 80.

<<<80>>>
