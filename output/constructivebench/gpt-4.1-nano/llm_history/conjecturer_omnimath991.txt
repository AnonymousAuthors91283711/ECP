The expression combines reciprocals of parameters p, q, r with weights 1, 2, 3, respectively. Since the polynomial factors into roots p, q, r with positive ordering, the minimal sum occurs at the harmonic mean for positive roots, leading to a value that can be simplified to 1 divided by the root that balances the sum — specifically, when p = q = r, the minimal sum is 1/p + 2/p + 3/p = 6/p. Given the fixed coefficients and symmetry, the minimal s coincides with 1 divided by the root of the polynomial x^3 - a x^2 + b x - 48, which is when the roots are equal. Solving the polynomial for equal roots p = q = r, the root shifts to 2. Therefore:

<<<6 / 2>>>

which simplifies to 3.
