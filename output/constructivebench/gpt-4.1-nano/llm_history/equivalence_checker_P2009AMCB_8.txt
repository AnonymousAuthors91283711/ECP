abbrev P2009AMCB_8_answer : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem P2009AMCB_8 (a b : ℝ) :
  ∃ (w : ℝ) (c : ℝ), 
    (2/3 * c + w = a) ∧ 
    (1/2 * c + w = b) ∧ 
    (c + w = P2009AMCB_8_answer a b) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => 3 * a - 2 * b
Proposed Answer: fun a b => a + b
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find a function P2009AMCB_8_answer(a,b) that satisfies the given system of equations involving c and w.

2. From the equations:
   - (1) 2/3*c + w = a
   - (2) 1/2*c + w = b

3. We can solve this system:
   Subtract (2) from (1): (2/3 - 1/2)c = a - b => (1/6)c = a - b => c = 6(a - b)
   Substitute c into (2): 1/2*6(a-b) + w = b => 3(a-b) + w = b => w = b - 3(a-b) = 4b - 3a

4. Then c + w = 6(a-b) + (4b-3a) = 3a - 2b

The ground truth answer correctly gives this result (3a - 2b), while the proposed answer (a + b) is incorrect.
