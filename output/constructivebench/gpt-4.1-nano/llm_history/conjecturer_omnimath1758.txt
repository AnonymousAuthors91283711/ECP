: IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∀ m : ℕ, m > 0 → ∃ a : Fin n → ℤ, m = ∑ i : Fin n, (a i) ^ (2015 : ℕ)} omnimath1758_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern, the minimal n such that every positive integer m is expressible as a sum of n powers aᵢ^2015 is n=2 (since for large m, combinations of two powers cover all sufficiently large integers, and trivial for small integers). The minimal such n satisfying the property is 2.
