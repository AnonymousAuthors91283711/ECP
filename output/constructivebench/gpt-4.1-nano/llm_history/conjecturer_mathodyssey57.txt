The conditions imply a recursive relation between a n and a n+1 via tangent and cosine. The initial value a 1 = π/6 and the pattern suggests a telescoping product involving sine and cosine. Analyzing the recurrence, the product of sines from 1 to m cancels with cosines from a prior step, resulting in a ratio involving sine values at the bounds, consistently leading to 1/100 for large m. The natural closed form is a constant ratio, thus:
