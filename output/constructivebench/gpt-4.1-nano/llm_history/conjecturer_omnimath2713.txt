theorem omnimath2713 :
  ∃! N, 400 < N ∧ N < 600 ∧ Odd N ∧ 5 ∣ N ∧ 11 ∣ N ∧
  (digits 10 N).sum = omnimath2713_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The answer must be an odd number between 400 and 600 divisible by both 5 and 11, and the sum of its digits is fixed. To satisfy divisibility by 5 and 11: N ≡ 0 mod 55, and N is odd, so N ≡ 55 mod 110. Range: 400 < N < 600, solutions: N= 495, 605 (over 600), so N=495 only. Sum digits: 4+9+5=18.  
Final answer in Lean: <<<495>>>
