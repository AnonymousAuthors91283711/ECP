theorem omnimath3688 (n : ℕ) :
  0 < n ∧ n < 1000 ∧ (List.sum (digits 10 n))^3 = n^2 ↔ n ∈ omnimath3688_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Based on the pattern and the pattern in the enumerated answers, the only n satisfying (sum of digits)^3 = n^2 for n between 1 and 999 are perfect cubes whose digit sum cubed equals the number itself squared. Checking candidates, such n are 1, 512, and 4913 (but 4913 > 1000).  
Thus, the solution set includes n where n is a perfect cube with digit sum = n^(2/3). Since only n=1 and n=512 within n<1000 satisfy this, the answer is {1, 512}.  
Final answer in Lean:  
<<<{1, 512}>>>
