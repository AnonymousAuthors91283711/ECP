Ground Truth Answer: 28
Proposed Answer: 20 * 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step:

1. Total games = 60
2. Games per pair = 60/3 = 20
3. For Alvin vs Bingyi:
   - Total games: 20
   - Alvin wins: 20% of 20 = 4
   - Bingyi wins: 20 - 4 = 16
4. For Bingyi vs Cheska:
   - Total games: 20
   - Bingyi wins: 60% of 20 = 12
   - Cheska wins: 20 - 12 = 8
5. For Cheska vs Alvin:
   - Total games: 20
   - Cheska wins: 40% of 20 = 8
   - Alvin wins: 20 - 8 = 12
6. Total Bingyi wins:
   - From AB: 16
   - From BC: 12
   - From CA: 0 (Bingyi doesn't play in CA games)
   - Total: 16 + 12 = 28

The ground truth answer is 28, which matches our calculation.

The proposed answer is "20 * 2" which equals 40. This is incorrect as it doesn't match the calculation and the ground truth answer.

<<<False>>>
