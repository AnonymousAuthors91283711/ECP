theorem P2008AMCB_7 (x y : ℝ) :
    ((x - y)^2 - (y - x)^2)^2 = P2008AMCB_7_answer x y := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
The given expression simplifies to zero since \((x - y)^2 = (y - x)^2\), so the difference inside the square is zero. The only consistent solution for the right side function that satisfies the equation for all \(x, y\) is zero.
