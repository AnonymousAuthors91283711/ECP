abbrev P2005AMCA_5_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2005AMCA_5 : 
  ∀ (xs : Fin 20 → ℝ) (ys : Fin 30 → ℝ), 
    (∑ i, xs i) / 20 = 30 → 
    (∑ i, ys i) / 30 = 20 → 
    (∑ i, xs i + ∑ i, ys i) / 50 = P2005AMCA_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the averages, total sums are 20*30=600 and 30*20=600, sum is 600+600=1200, average over 50 is 1200/50=24. 

Final answer: <<<24>>>
