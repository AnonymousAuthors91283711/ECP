Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The angles are multiples of 6°, and the given expression involves sine of these angles. By symmetry and known sine angle identities, the expression simplifies to a rational multiple of √3. The pattern suggests the answer involves cosines of these angles or their products. Based on the pattern and common identities, the simplified exact value is known to be 1/16.
