  (∀ (s t : ℝ), (∃ (m n : ℤ), eval₂ (algebraMap ℤ ℝ) s P = m ∧ eval₂ (algebraMap ℤ ℝ) t P = n) → 
    ∃ (k : ℤ), eval₂ (algebraMap ℤ ℝ) (s * t) P = k) ↔ P ∈ omnimath4010_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ[X])
The enumerated answers suggest that the set includes all polynomials with constant value evaluations for any real inputs and their products. The pattern implies the set contains constant polynomials with integer coefficients, as they satisfy the property universally. To generalize, the answer set should include all such constant polynomials: polynomials with zero degree.
