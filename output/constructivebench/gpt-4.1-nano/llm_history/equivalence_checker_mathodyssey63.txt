Ground Truth Answer: 0
Proposed Answer: 3
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest natural number n such that there exists a multiset of integers with exactly n distinct elements where for each x in the multiset, (P∘P)(x) = x².

2. The ground truth answer is 0, meaning there are no integers x satisfying (P∘P)(x) = x².

3. The proposed answer is 3, suggesting there are 3 distinct integers satisfying the condition.

To evaluate:
- The polynomial P is constrained by three evaluation points, but we don't have its exact form.
- The condition (P∘P)(x) = x² is quite restrictive.
- Given the ground truth says 0, it's likely that no integers satisfy this condition based on the given constraints on P.

The proposed answer of 3 contradicts the ground truth of 0, and without seeing the full proof, we can't verify the proposed answer's validity. Since the ground truth is authoritative here, we should consider the proposed answer incorrect.
