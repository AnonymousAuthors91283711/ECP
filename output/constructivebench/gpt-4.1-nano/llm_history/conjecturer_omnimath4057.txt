Based on the pattern that minimal m corresponds to the smallest integer where the combinatorial constraints are satisfied, and considering the bounds use -a to b, the smallest such m is when s contains exactly three elements that sum to zero, with the minimal size being 3, just enough for such 3-element subsets. Thus, the least m satisfying this for any a, b > 0 is 3.
