The condition (n.divisors).card^3 = 4 * n suggests small values with divisors count as perfect cubes. For n = 1, divisors = 1, count=1, 1^3=1 ≠ 4*1=4. For n=2, divisors = 1,2; count=2, 2^3=8 ≠ 8. For larger n, cubic divisors are rare. n=4, divisors=1,2,4, count=3, 3^3=27≠16. n=8, divisors=1,2,4,8, count=4, 64≠ 32. The only n where (divisors).card is 2, for example n=2 gives 8=8. So, candidate n=2, check for it. Final answer: 

<<<{2}>>>
