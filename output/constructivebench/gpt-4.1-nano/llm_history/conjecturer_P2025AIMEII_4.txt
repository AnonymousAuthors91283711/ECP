Given that the product ∏_{k=0}^{9} (2^{2^k} + 1) is the 10th Fermat number F_10, which is known to be composite, but the problem asks for coprime m, n such that their ratio equals this product, and m + n = answer.

The Fermat number F_10 = 2^{2^10} + 1 = 2^{1024} + 1.

Since the problem asks for an answer related to this product and the sum m + n, the known conjecture suggests that m and n are likely powers of 2 related to the Fermat number structure.

The simplest plausible generalization is that the product is m/n with m = F_10 and n=1, so their sum is F_10 + 1.

But as it asks for coprime m, n, and the sum, the most straightforward closed form expression, consistent with the pattern, is:

<<<(2^(2^10) + 1) + 1>>>
