The root cause of the compilation error is that the expression `n | n = 198` uses `n` without having it defined or introduced, and the syntax is not valid for an `abbrev`. To fix this, I should either fix the syntax to express that the answer is the specific number `198`, or define a function or a specific numeral value directly.

Given the context, the answer seems to be a fixed concrete number, likely the minimal such `n`. Since the return type is `ℕ`, and the enumerated answers suggest the answer is `198`, then the simplest correct expression is just the numeral `198`.

Furthermore, you are asked to provide a closed form in Lean that can be directly used, so an `abbrev` should be defined as the numeral `198`.

### Final Answer (fixed and general):

<<<198>>>

**Explanation:**  
Initially, the faulty code attempted to define the answer as `n | n = 198`. The syntax error arises because `n` was not defined or introduced, and `n | ...` is an invalid syntax for an `abbrev`. The logical conclusion, based on the enumerated answer and the expected form, is that the answer is a fixed number — specifically `198`. Lean expects an expression like `198` for a `ℕ` value or a constant numerator.

Since the problem involves determining some minimal natural number related to the given equations, and the enumerated pattern suggests the answer is `198`, the correctly fixed answer in Lean is simply the numeral `198`.
