The conditions restrict permutations where each (f i + 1)(f (i+1) + 1) ≤ 20; with the domain size 7, and considering the bounds, the permutations are limited to elements in {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} with small products. The enumeration suggests the total count is 10, as the only permutations satisfying these constraints are those with structure close to identity or small deviations.
