The problem asks for the size \( m \) of the largest family of subsets with increasing sizes and no one subset contained in another. Recognizing the pattern, the maximal such \( m \) for \( n \geq 4 \) is the binomial coefficient for choosing \(\lfloor n/2 \rfloor\) elements, which balances the subset sizes and ensures the antichain condition. 

Thus, the final answer is the middle binomial coefficient:
<<<fun n : ℕ => Nat.choose n (n / 2)>>>
