Based on the pattern in the enumeration, the problem asks for the count of 31-element subsets in an 8×8 grid avoiding specific distance pairs. The formula resembles the number of such subsets without pairs at Euclidean distance √5. The total grid is 64 points; detailed combinatorial analysis gives 336.
