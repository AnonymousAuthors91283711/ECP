The pattern suggests the extremal value of the product occurs when the points are symmetrically distributed, likely at the endpoints -1 and 1, considering the bounds. The maximum product over all such configurations is achieved when the points are at ±1, alternating or symmetric, leading to the product of pairwise differences being maximized. Hence, the greatest value is 1, corresponding to the configuration where differences are maximized with minimal overlap. Therefore, the answer is 1.
