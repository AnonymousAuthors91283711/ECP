  let switchProb (t : ℕ) : ℚ := 1/(2 * t^2)
  let stayProb (t : ℕ) : ℚ := 1 - switchProb t
  let rec p : ℕ → ℚ

    | n + 1 => stayProb (n + 1) * p n + switchProb (n + 1) * (1 - p n)
  p 15 = omnimath1516_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The pattern indicates the probability converges to 1/2 as n grows large, since switching probabilities diminish with increasing t, balancing staying and switching. 

Thus, the simplified closed-form answer is: <<<1/2>>>
