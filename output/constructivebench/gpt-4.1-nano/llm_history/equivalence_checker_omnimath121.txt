Ground Truth Answer: fun c => fun n => c * n
Proposed Answer: fun c : ℝ => fun k : ℕ+ => c * k
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer `fun c : ℝ => fun k : ℕ+ => c * k` is equivalent to the ground truth answer `fun c => fun n => c * n`. Both answers define a function that takes a real number `c` and returns a function from positive natural numbers to real numbers, where each positive natural number `n` (or `k` in the proposed answer) is multiplied by `c`. The only difference is the choice of variable names (`k` vs `n`), which does not affect the mathematical meaning of the function. Therefore, the answers are equivalent.
