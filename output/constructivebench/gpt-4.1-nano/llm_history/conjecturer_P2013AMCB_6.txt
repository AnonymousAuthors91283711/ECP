abbrev P2013AMCB_6_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2013AMCB_6 (x y : ℝ) :
    x^2 + y^2 = 10*x - 6*y - 34 → x + y = P2013AMCB_6_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests solving the quadratic relation for x + y; completing the square yields (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 0. Therefore, x = 5, y = -3; sum is zero.  
Final answer: <<<0>>>
