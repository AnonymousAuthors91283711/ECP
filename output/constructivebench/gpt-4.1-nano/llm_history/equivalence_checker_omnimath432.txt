Ground Truth Answer: fun (a, b) => a + b - Nat.gcd a b
Proposed Answer: fun ⟨a, b⟩ => (a / Nat.gcd a b) + (b / Nat.gcd a b)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The problem is about finding the minimal n = x + y where x*b = y*a. This is essentially finding the least common multiple (LCM) expressed in terms of a and b, since LCM(a,b) = (a*b)/gcd(a,b).

The ground truth answer is: a + b - gcd(a,b)
The proposed answer is: (a/gcd(a,b)) + (b/gcd(a,b))

Let's test with the given values a=221, b=403:
1. gcd(221,403) = 13
2. Ground truth: 221 + 403 - 13 = 611
3. Proposed: (221/13) + (403/13) = 17 + 31 = 48

These give different results (611 vs 48), so they're not equivalent. The proposed answer is actually giving the minimal solution when a and b are divided by their gcd (reduced form), while the ground truth is giving something else.

The correct minimal solution should indeed be (a/gcd(a,b)) + (b/gcd(a,b)), as this represents the minimal x + y in the reduced equation where x*(b/gcd) = y*(a/gcd).
