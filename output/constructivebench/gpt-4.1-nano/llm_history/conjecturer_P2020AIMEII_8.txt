The pattern of f suggests its zeros occur at the integers less than n+1, with the sum of these zeros cumulatively increasing with n. To exceed 500,000, the minimal n would be around where the sum of zeros (which are simply these integers) just surpasses 500,000. Summing integers from 0 to n yields n(n+1)/2, so solving n(n+1)/2 > 500,000 for minimal integer n.

Thus, the smallest n satisfying n(n+1)/2 > 500,000 is the least answer.

Calculate: n(n+1)/2 > 500,000 ⇒ n² + n - 1,000,000 > 0.

Discriminant D = 1 + 4,000,000 = 4,000,001.

Approximate n = (−1 + √4,000,001)/2 ≈ (−1 + 2000)/2 = 999.5. The minimal integer n is thus 1000.

Therefore, the answer is 1000.

<<<1000>>>
