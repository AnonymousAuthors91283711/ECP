Ground Truth Answer: 217 / 900
Proposed Answer: (1:ℚ) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the average number of divisors for numbers from 1 to 100. It sums up all divisor relationships (d|z) and divides by the total possible pairs (D.card * Z.card).

2. The ground truth answer 217/900 ≈ 0.2411 is correct because:
   - The total number of divisor relationships (numerator) is ∑_{z=1}^{100} τ(z) where τ(z) is the number of divisors of z
   - For numbers 1-100, this sum is 482
   - The denominator is |D| * |Z| = 9 * 100 = 900
   - But wait, 482/900 simplifies to 241/450 ≈ 0.5356, which doesn't match 217/900
   - Actually, the correct sum of τ(z) for z=1..100 is 482, but the problem counts each (d,z) pair where d|z, which is exactly the same as counting all divisors of all numbers, so it should be 482/900
   - Therefore, the ground truth answer seems incorrect, but the proposed answer of 1/2 is even more incorrect

3. The proposed answer 1/2 is clearly wrong because:
   - The actual ratio is about 0.5356 (482/900)
   - 1/2 would be 0.5, which is close but not correct
   - Moreover, the ground truth answer claims 217/900, which is different from both
