The pattern suggests minimal total n satisfying the maximum counts for 0, 1, 2, and 3; considering constraints, the minimal total is achieved when counts of each are just below their maximum, but at least one reaches the threshold of 3. Summing (3, 3, 1, 9) gives 16, which meets the minimal condition.
