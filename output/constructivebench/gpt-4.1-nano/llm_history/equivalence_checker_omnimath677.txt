Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2^n - 2) / 3
Proposed Answer: fun n => (n + 1) / 3
Let me analyze this problem carefully.

The problem is about evaluating a sum of binomial coefficients where k ≡ 1 mod 3. The ground truth answer suggests that for any natural number n, this sum equals (2^n - 2)/3. The proposed answer suggests it's (n + 1)/3.

To check equivalence:
1. Let's test with n=1:
   - Ground truth: (2^1 - 2)/3 = 0
   - Proposed: (1+1)/3 = 2/3
   - Not equal

2. For n=4:
   - Ground truth: (16-2)/3 = 14/3
   - Proposed: (4+1)/3 = 5/3
   - Not equal

3. For n=2003 (as in the theorem):
   - Ground truth is an enormous number (2^2003 - 2)/3
   - Proposed is just 2004/3
   - Clearly different

The proposed answer grows linearly while the ground truth grows exponentially. They are fundamentally different formulas.
