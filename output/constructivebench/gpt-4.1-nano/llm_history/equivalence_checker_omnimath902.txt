Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the infimum of the set {x ∈ ℝ | ∃ y > 0, x > 0 ∧ x + y² = xy}

2. The ground truth answer is 4, which is correct because:
   - The equation x + y² = xy can be rewritten as x(y-1) = y²
   - For y > 1, x = y²/(y-1)
   - The minimum of this function occurs at y=2, giving x=4/(2-1)=4
   - For 0 < y < 1, x becomes negative, which violates x > 0
   - Therefore, the infimum is indeed 4

3. The proposed answer is 0, which is incorrect because:
   - As y approaches 1 from above, x approaches infinity
   - As y increases beyond 2, x increases
   - The smallest x occurs at y=2 with x=4
   - 0 is not in the set and is not a lower bound since all x > 4 are in the set
