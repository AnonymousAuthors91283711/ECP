Ground Truth Answer: 4^2004 + 2^2004
Proposed Answer:  2^(2*2005 - 2) + 2^(2005 - 1)
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. The ground truth answer is: 4^2004 + 2^2004
2. The proposed answer is: 2^(2*2005 - 2) + 2^(2005 - 1)

Let's simplify the proposed answer:
- 2^(2*2005 - 2) = 2^(4010 - 2) = 2^4008 = (2^2)^2004 = 4^2004
- 2^(2005 - 1) = 2^2004

So the proposed answer simplifies to: 4^2004 + 2^2004, which exactly matches the ground truth answer.
