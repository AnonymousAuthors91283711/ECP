I observe from the pattern of the given functional equation and the quadratic form that the constants a, b, c are related to the polynomial, and P2009AMCA_9_answer likely is the value of a + b + c. Given the pattern and the nature of the translation, the sum of coefficients should be 3, derived from the fact that the quadratic transformation involves 3x^2 terms and linear terms combined with constant shifts. Therefore, the closed form should be:
