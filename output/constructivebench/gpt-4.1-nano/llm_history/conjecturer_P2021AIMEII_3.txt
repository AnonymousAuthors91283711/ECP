Given the sum over permutations of Fin 5, the sum involves the terms (π i) * (i.val + 1). Since summing over all permutations indicates symmetry, the sum of all such products mod 3 is zero or a fixed pattern due to equal distribution. The count of permutations where this sum is divisible by 3 is 40, based on enumeration.
