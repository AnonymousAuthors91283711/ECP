The problem seeks the set of all integer pairs \(\langle x, y \rangle\) satisfying a divisibility condition with positive integers \(x, y\). The pattern in the enumerated solutions suggests that solutions are specific and depend on divisibility properties of the expression.

Analyzing the given expression:

\[
x^2 y + x + y \equiv 0 \pmod{x y^2 + y + 7}
\]

For positive integers \(x, y\), the solutions are likely to be pairs where \(x\) divides something simple or relates proportionally to \(y\), or vice versa, to satisfy the divisibility condition.

From the pattern and common divisor-based reasoning, the general form appears to involve \(x = 1\) or some multiple of \(7\) or \(y\).

Based on the enumerated solutions hint and divisibility conditions, the set includes pairs where \(x = 1\), and \(y\) satisfies the divisibility, or \(x\) is a multiple of \(7\).

The conjectured general solution is:

\[
\{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{Z}^2 \mid x = 1 \text{ or } 7 \mid x, y \text{ arbitrary} \}
\]

Final answer:

<<<(if x = 1 then y ∈ ℤ) ∨ (7 ∣ x) ∧ y ∈ ℤ>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The main issue is that the proposed answer is written as a logical statement, not as a set expression in Lean syntax. In Lean, defining a set of pairs with a property involves using set comprehension, i.e., `{p : ℤ × ℤ | ... }`. 

Given the conjecture, the set should include pairs \(\langle x, y \rangle\) such that \(x = 1\) (for any \(y\)) or \(7 \mid x\) (for any \(y\)). Since the problem states \(x > 0\) and \(y > 0\), we can incorporate these conditions. 

Also, the set is all pairs satisfying the divisibility condition, so the formula inside the set comprehension should reflect the conditions:

- \(x > 0\),
- \(y > 0\),
- and either \(x = 1\) or \(7 \mid x\),
- and the divisibility condition \( (x^2 y + x + y) \equiv 0 \pmod{ x y^2 + y + 7} \).

The previous proposed answer failed because it was a logical statement rather than a set comprehension.

**Final answer:**

<<<{ ⟨x, y⟩ : ℤ × ℤ | x > 0 ∧ y > 0 ∧ (x = 1 ∨ 7 ∣ x) ∧ (x^2 * y + x + y) % (x * y^2 + y + 7) = 0 }>>>
