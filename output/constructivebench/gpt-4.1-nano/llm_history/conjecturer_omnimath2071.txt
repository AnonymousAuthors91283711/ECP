The sum counts the total number of distinct digits appearing in all integers from \(10^{2018}\) to \(10^{2019} - 1\). Since every number in this range is a 2019-digit number starting from 1 (leading digit cannot be zero), each digit 0..9 appears uniformly in each position, with the first digit ranging from 1..9, and the other positions from 0..9. The total distinct digits involved across all positions is 10.

Therefore, the total sum of the sizes of the digit sets should be \(9 \times 10^{2018} + 9 \times 2018 \times 10^{2017}\), summed over all numbers. But the number of distinct digits in the union is simply all digits 0..9, each appearing at some position.

Final answer: <<<10>>>
