The logical constraints describe all 2×2 Boolean matrices with specific relations between entries. Filtering possible matrices reveals only those with exactly two entries as false, others true, matching the logical conditions.

Answer: There are exactly 4 such matrices, hence the answer is 4.

<<<4>>>
