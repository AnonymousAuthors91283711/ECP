The interval between √15 and √50 corresponds roughly to numbers between approximately 3.87 and 7.07; there are integers 4, 5, 6, 7 in this interval. So, the count is 4.

. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The current proposed answer is given as a natural number, specifically 4, based on counting integers 4, 5, 6, and 7 within the interval between √15 and √50. The errors occur because the proposal includes a descriptive sentence, which is not valid syntax for a definition in Lean. The answer should be a pure mathematical expression with no descriptive text, directly providing the value.

Given the approximate bounds:
- √15 ≈ 3.87298
- √50 ≈ 7.07107

The integers strictly between these bounds are 4, 5, 6, 7. Hence, the total count is 4. This is consistent with the reasoning that only these four integers satisfy √15 < n < √50.

Therefore, the answer should be simply the number 4, expressed as a natural number in Lean.

<<<4>>>

This conforms with the requirements, being a closed form natural number answer without extraneous description.
