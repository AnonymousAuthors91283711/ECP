open Set

abbrev P2018AMCA_4_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem P2018AMCA_4 (d : ℝ) :
    (¬ (d ≥ 6) ∧ ¬ (d ≤ 5) ∧ ¬ (d ≤ 4)) ↔ d ∈ P2018AMCA_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The constraints imply d > 5 and d < 6, so d is in (5,6). The answer set is the open interval (5,6). 
Final answer: <<<{d : ℝ | 5 < d ∧ d < 6}>>>
