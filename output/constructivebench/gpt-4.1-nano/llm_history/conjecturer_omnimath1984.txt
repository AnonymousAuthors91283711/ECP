  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | n < 2012 ∧ ∀ d : ℕ, d ∣ n → (digits 2 d).count 1 ≤ 2} omnimath1984_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the enumeration and pattern, the maximum n below 2012 divisible by any d that satisfies the digit count condition is n = 2011, which is prime and less than 2012,and digits of 2 are just '2' with count 0 of 1s, which satisfies the condition. So the final answer in a closed form is 2011.
