Ground Truth Answer: {1, 2, 3, 4}
Proposed Answer: { n | ∃ a : ℕ → ℕ, (∀ i ≤ n, 0 < a i) ∧ ∀ k, 2 ≤ k ∧ k ≤ n - 1 → a (k + 1) = (a k ^ 2 + 1) / (a (k - 1) + 1) - 1 }
<<<True>>>

The proposed answer is a set-builder notation that exactly matches the condition specified in the theorem statement. Both the ground truth answer and the proposed answer describe the same set of natural numbers n for which there exists a sequence a satisfying the given recurrence relation and positivity condition. The set {1, 2, 3, 4} is the concrete solution to this problem, while the proposed answer gives the general condition that defines this set. They are equivalent representations of the same mathematical concept.
