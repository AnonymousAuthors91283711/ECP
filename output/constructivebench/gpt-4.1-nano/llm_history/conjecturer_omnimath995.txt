The pattern suggests we're looking for primes p where the equation y² ≡ x³ + 4x mod p has exactly p solutions, i.e., the set of solutions size equals p. Among small primes, p=2 and p=3 satisfy such conditions due to their algebraic properties. For larger primes, solutions are less likely to be p since the curve's number of solutions usually varies. To match this pattern, the set of primes p satisfying the property is {2, 3}.  
Final answer: <<<{2, 3}>>>
