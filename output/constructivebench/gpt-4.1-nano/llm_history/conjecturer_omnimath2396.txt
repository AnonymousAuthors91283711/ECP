Since the condition involves invertible matrices \(A, B\) with \(A B - B A = B^2 A\), analyzing special cases reveals that the key parameter is the size \(n\). For \(n=1\), the matrices are scalars; trivial, as \(A, B \neq 0\). For \(n \ge 2\), the relation suggests specific constraints. The pattern indicates solutions appear precisely when \(n=1\), with other sizes failing to satisfy the condition. Therefore, the answer set includes only \(n=1\).
