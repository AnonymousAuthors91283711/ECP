Ground Truth Answer: 36 / 35
Proposed Answer: (1 + 1/ 35)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the least positive real number x where the floor of x divided by (x minus its floor) equals 35.

2. The ground truth answer is 36/35.

3. The proposed answer is (1 + 1/35), which simplifies to 36/35.

The two expressions are mathematically identical:
36/35 = 1 + 1/35

Therefore, the answers are equivalent.
