The formula resembles the factorization involving symmetric sums and power sums that connect via identities for sums of roots, hinting that the relation holds when (m, n) are both odd or both even. The pattern suggests:

<<<{(m, n) | (m mod 2 = 0 ∧ n mod 2 = 0) ∨ (m mod 2 = 1 ∧ n mod 2 = 1)}>>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The main issue is that in Lean, the λ-expressions for set definitions must produce elements of the set type, i.e., pairs (m, n) of natural numbers, and must be placed inside a set notation with explicit lambda function syntax. The current proposed answer attempts to directly write the set as a comprehension without wrapping it into a λ-expression.

The enumeration pattern suggests that the answer involves pairs where m and n are either both even or both odd. To express this set correctly in Lean, use the set notation with a lambda function: { (m, n) | m and n are natural numbers satisfying the parity condition }.

The correct form is:
```lean
{ (m, n) | (m % 2 = 0 ∧ n % 2 = 0) ∨ (m % 2 = 1 ∧ n % 2 = 1) }
```

This is a set of pairs (m, n) where both are even or both are odd. The key correction is to write the set with explicit lambda syntax: `Set.ofSet` or curly braces with `|` for comprehension with `(m, n)` on the left side.

Final answer enclosed with delimiter:

<<<{ (m, n) | (m % 2 = 0 ∧ n % 2 = 0) ∨ (m % 2 = 1 ∧ n % 2 = 1) }>>>
