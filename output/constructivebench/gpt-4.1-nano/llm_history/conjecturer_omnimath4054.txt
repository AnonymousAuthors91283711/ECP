The pattern suggests the answer involves characterizing n where no two prefix sums (mod n) are equal, which aligns with derangements of sequences. Such for n ≥ 2, it's n!; for n = 1, it's 1. Extending from patterns and known combinatorial constructs, the set likely includes all positive integers (or a specific subset). Given the constraints, the set of n where the property holds is exactly n=1, since for larger n there are always repetitions, but for the minimal case, the set contains 1. 

Thus, the closed form set is:<<<{1}>>>
