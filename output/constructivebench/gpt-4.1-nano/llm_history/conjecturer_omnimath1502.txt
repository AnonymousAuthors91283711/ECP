The problem asks for the minimal degree \( d \) such that there exists a primitive polynomial \( f \) over \(\mathbb{Z}\) with degree \( d \), evaluated at all natural numbers \( n \), divisible by 85. Since \( 85 = 5 \times 17 \), the minimal polynomial likely encodes a condition divisible by both primes. The polynomial \( f(n) = (n)(n - 17) \) has degree 2, always divisible by 85 for \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 17 \pmod{17} \), but may not cover all \( n \). To guarantee divisibility for all \( n \), the minimal degree polynomial is quadratic. It's plausible that the minimal such degree is 2.
