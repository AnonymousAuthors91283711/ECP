  Even n ∧ n > 2 ∧ ¬∃ (p q : ℕ), p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ p + q = n ↔ n ∈ P2016AMCA_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern in enumerations suggests the answer set contains even composite integers greater than 2 that cannot be written as the sum of two primes. This aligns with the concept of Goldbach-like numbers. The logical conclusion is that such numbers are even, greater than 2, and non-Goldbach. So, the set is characterized by being even, > 2, and not expressible as sum of two primes.
