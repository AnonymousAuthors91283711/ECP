theorem P2009AMCA_7 (x n : ℕ) (hx : 3 * x - 8 ≠ 0) :
  (5 * x - 11) - (2 * x - 3) = (3 * x + 1) - (5 * x - 11) ∧
  2 * x - 3 + (n - 1) * (3 * x - 8) = 2009 ↔
  n = P2009AMCA_7_answer x := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The second equation simplifies to n = (2009 - (2x - 3)) / (3x - 8). Combining with the given condition and simplifying, the answer is n = (2009 + 2x - 3) / (3x - 8).  
Final answer: <<<fun x : ℕ => (2006 + 2 * x) / (3 * x - 8)>>>
