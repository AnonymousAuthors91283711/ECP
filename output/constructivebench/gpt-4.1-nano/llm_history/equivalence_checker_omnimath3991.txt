Ground Truth Answer: 13/4
Proposed Answer: 1 / 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a system of equations with variables cake_price, cupcake_price, and bagel_price.
2. We need to find the value of omnimath3991_answer that satisfies all equations.
3. The ground truth answer is 13/4 (3.25).
4. The proposed answer is 1/2 (0.5).

To verify, let's solve the system:

From first equation: 1*cake + 2*cupcake + 3*bagel = 3*cake + 1*bagel
Simplifies to: 2*cupcake + 2*bagel = 2*cake → cake = cupcake + bagel

From second equation: 3*cake + 1*bagel = 6*cupcake
Substitute cake: 3*(cupcake + bagel) + bagel = 6*cupcake
Simplifies to: 3*cupcake + 4*bagel = 6*cupcake → 4*bagel = 3*cupcake → bagel = (3/4)*cupcake

Now, from third equation: 2*cake + 2*bagel = answer * cupcake
Substitute cake and bagel: 2*(cupcake + (3/4)cupcake) + 2*(3/4)cupcake = answer*cupcake
Simplifies to: 2*(7/4)cupcake + (6/4)cupcake = answer*cupcake → (14/4 + 6/4)cupcake = answer*cupcake → 20/4 = answer → 5 = answer

Wait, this contradicts both answers. The correct answer should be 5, not 13/4 or 1/2. 

However, the ground truth is given as 13/4, which suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine the third equation:

Original third equation: 2*cake + 2*bagel = answer * cupcake
With cake = cupcake + bagel and bagel = (3/4)cupcake:
2*(cupcake + (3/4)cupcake) + 2*(3/4)cupcake = answer*cupcake
= 2*(7/4)cupcake + (6/4)cupcake = (14/4 + 6/4)cupcake = 20/4 cupcake = 5 cupcake

The calculation seems correct, yielding answer = 5. Neither 13/4 nor 1/2 matches this.
