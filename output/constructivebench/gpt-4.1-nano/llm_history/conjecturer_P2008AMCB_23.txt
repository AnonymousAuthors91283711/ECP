  {n : ℕ | ∑ d in divisors (10^n), logb 10 (d : ℝ) = 792} = {P2008AMCB_23_answer} := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the sum over divisors of 10^n, where each divisor's base 10 logarithm equals 792, and noting that divisors of 10^n are powers of 10 up to 10^n, the only divisor with log_b 10 equal to 792 must be 10^792 itself. Therefore, n = 792.

<<<792>>>
