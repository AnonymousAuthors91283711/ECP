theorem P2006AMCA_8 : 
  Nat.card {p : ℕ × ℕ // 0 < p.1 ∧ 1 < p.2 ∧ (∑ x in Finset.Ico p.1 (p.1 + p.2), x) = 15} = P2006AMCA_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Because the sum from 0 to p.1 + p.2-1 of x equals 15, and the parameters satisfy p.1 > 0, p.2 > 1, with p being a pair, the problem reduces to counting pairs where p.1 + p.2-1 is at least 4, fitting candidate pairs summing to 15. The smaller p.1 must be greater than 0, p.2 greater than 1, and their sum plus p.2 relates to the sum. The enumeration suggests the total is 105.
