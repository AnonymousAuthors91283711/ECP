The pattern suggests the total sums minimal costs for edges with 2017 nodes, with each node's cost determined by incident edges. For a complete graph, each node's degree is 2016, and the sum over all edges is maximized when costs are minimized uniformly, leading to total sum as the sum over all pairs with minimal contributions, which simplifies to summing over each node's degree times its cost. Since the answer enumerates values proportional to n(n-1)/2, the total sum is n(n-1)/2 times the minimal possible cost per edge, which is 1, yielding total as the number of edges, i.e., 2017 * 2016 / 2. Simplify to 2017 * 1008.

Answer: <<<2017 * 1008>>>
