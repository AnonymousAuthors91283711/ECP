Ground Truth Answer: 1/3
Proposed Answer: (1/6 : ℚ)
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem involves calculating a probability where:
   - Ben has 3 possible outcomes [5, 10, 20]
   - Jamie has 2 possible outcomes [30, 40]
   - Total possible outcomes is 3 × 2 = 6
   - We need to find probability that b + j = 50

2. Checking favorable outcomes:
   - 20 + 30 = 50
   - 10 + 40 = 50
   - So there are 2 favorable outcomes

3. Probability calculation:
   - Favorable outcomes: 2
   - Total outcomes: 6
   - Probability = 2/6 = 1/3

The ground truth answer is correct (1/3), while the proposed answer is 1/6, which is incorrect as it only counts one favorable outcome instead of two.
