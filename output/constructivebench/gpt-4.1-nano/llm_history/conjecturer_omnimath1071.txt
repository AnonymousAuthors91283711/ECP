The inequality constraints imply the sum of five positive integers ≤ 10, so the maximum sum is 10, and minimal individual values are 1. The count of such 5-tuples with product constraint ≤ sum constraint is symmetrical. The total count of solutions with minimal constraints results in the sum of combinations, leading to 120 as total solutions satisfying all conditions.
