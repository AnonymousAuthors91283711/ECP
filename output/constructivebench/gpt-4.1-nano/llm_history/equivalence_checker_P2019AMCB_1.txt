theorem P2019AMCB_1 : 
  ∀ (V₁ V₂ : ℚ), 0 < V₁ → 0 < V₂ →

Ground Truth Answer: 9/10
Proposed Answer: (3/4) * (6/5)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us the equation (5/6)*V₁ = (3/4)*V₂ and asks us to find V₁/V₂
2. Solving for V₁/V₂:
   - (5/6)*V₁ = (3/4)*V₂
   - V₁/V₂ = (3/4)/(5/6)
   - V₁/V₂ = (3/4)*(6/5) = 18/20 = 9/10

The ground truth answer is 9/10, which is correct.
The proposed answer is (3/4)*(6/5), which when simplified equals 9/10.

The answers are mathematically equivalent, just in different forms (one simplified, one not).
