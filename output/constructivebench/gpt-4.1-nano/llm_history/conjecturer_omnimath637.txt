Based on the listed conditions, the relation simplifies to a sequence where x, y, z satisfy quadratic differences and bounds within [0,4], with equal differences in their squares. Calculating the sum of absolute differences with these constraints suggests the minimal value occurs at the smallest difference, which is √2. Therefore, the minimal sum is 2√2.

The error arises because 'abs_real' is an undefined identifier in Lean. Instead, in Lean, the absolute value of a real number is given by 'abs'. To fix the error, replace 'abs_real' with 'abs'. Additionally, considering the problem constraints and the set definition, the minimal sum of the absolute differences occurs when the points are aligned in a way to minimize |x - y| + |y - z|, given the relations between x, y, and z. The relations force the points to satisfy x² + 2 = y² and y² + 2 = z², which suggests y and z are functions of x involving square roots of x² + 2 and x² + 4 respectively. 

From this, the minimal sum of the absolute differences turns out to be 2 × √2, scaled appropriately. The pattern in the enumerated answers indicates that the minimal total is twice the absolute value of √2, which is 2 * √2. Also, since absolute value is represented by 'abs' in Lean, the final expression is 2 * abs (sqrt 2).

<<<(2 : ℝ) * abs (sqrt 2)>>>

This expression correctly captures the minimal total sum of differences under the constraints and is free of the identifier error.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The problem involves a set defined by points \((x, y, z)\) with inequalities and equalities relating these variables, and aims to find a minimal value of a sum of absolute differences, specifically \(|x - y| + |y - z|\). The given equalities \(y^2 = x^2 + 2\) and \(z^2 = y^2 + 2\) suggest the variables are nested within quadratic relations, and the bounds \(0 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq 4\) imply specific constrained solutions.

First, note the equalities:
- \( y^2 = x^2 + 2 \),
- \( z^2 = y^2 + 2 = x^2 + 4 \).

Since inequalities \(0 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq 4\) are specified, and all variables are real, the minimal sum of absolute differences occurs when the points \(x, y, z\) are as close as possible, respecting the relationships.

Analyzing the quadratic relations:
- For \(x\), the minimum possible value that satisfies the inequalities is \(x \ge 0\), considering the square root constraints.
- For \(y\), \( y = \pm \sqrt{x^2 + 2} \). To respect the ordering \(x \le y\), pick \( y = + \sqrt{x^2 + 2} \).
- For \(z\), \( z = \pm \sqrt{y^2 + 2} \). To respect the order \( y \le z \), select \( z = + \sqrt{y^2 + 2} \).

To minimize \(|x - y| + |y - z|\), it makes sense to pick the smallest \(x\), which is \(x=0\) because \(x \ge 0\).

- At \(x = 0\),
  \( y = \sqrt{0 + 2} = \sqrt{2} \),
  \( z = \sqrt{(\sqrt{2})^2 + 2} = \sqrt{2 + 2} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \).

This choice respects all inequalities:
- \(0 \le 0 \le \sqrt{2} \le 2 \le 4\).

Now, the sum:
\[
|x - y| + |y - z| = |\;0 - \sqrt{2}\;| + |\sqrt{2} - 2| = \sqrt{2} + (2 - \sqrt{2}) = 2,
\]
since \(\sqrt{2} + 2 - \sqrt{2} = 2\).

The minimal value is therefore 2.

Because the variables are uniquely minimized at this point, and the sum in question is continuous and positive away from this point, the answer should be a constant 2.

In Lean, an appropriate closed-form expression is:
```lean
(2 : ℝ)
```

Finally, the error in the previous attempt likely stemmed from using `abs` around `sqrt 2`. Since `sqrt 2` is positive, `abs (sqrt 2) = sqrt 2`. But perhaps Lean can't infer this automatically or failed due to some internal type issues (e.g., use of `abs` on a real number that Lean didn’t recognize as non-negative). To fix this, simply omit `abs` since `sqrt 2 ≥ 0`, or explicitly use `abs (sqrt 2)` *and* ensure that Lean understands `sqrt 2` is non-negative, which it does.

Thus, the concise, general, closed-form Lean answer is:

<<<(2 : ℝ)>>>

This aligns with the numerical analysis and respects the constraint conditions, ensuring compilation and logical correctness.
