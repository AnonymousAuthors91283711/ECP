Given the recurrence a(k + 2) = a(k) - 3 / a(k + 1) with initial values, the pattern suggests that the sequence ultimately hits zero at m when it reaches a specific index related to initial conditions. The sequence resembles a quadratic pattern that becomes zero when m = (37 + 72)^2 - 1. 

Final expression:
<<<(37 + 72)^2 - 1>>>
