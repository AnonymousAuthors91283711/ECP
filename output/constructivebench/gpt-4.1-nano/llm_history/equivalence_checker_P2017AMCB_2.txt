Ground Truth Answer: fun x y z => y + z
Proposed Answer: fun x y z => x * (1 - y) * (z - 1) + 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. Problem Context:
- We have three real numbers x, y, z with constraints:
  - x ∈ (0,1)
  - y ∈ (-1,0)
  - z ∈ (1,2)
- We need to find an expression that's always positive under these constraints

2. Ground Truth Answer (y + z):
- y > -1 and z > 1 ⇒ y + z > -1 + 1 = 0
- This correctly satisfies the condition

3. Proposed Answer (x*(1-y)*(z-1) + 2):
- x > 0 and x < 1
- 1 - y > 1 (since y < 0) ⇒ 1 - y > 1
- z - 1 > 0 (since z > 1)
- Therefore x*(1-y)*(z-1) > 0
- Adding 2 makes the whole expression > 2 > 0
- This also satisfies the condition

However, the two expressions are not equivalent:
- For x=0.5, y=-0.5, z=1.5:
  - Ground Truth: -0.5 + 1.5 = 1.0
  - Proposed: 0.5*(1.5)*(0.5) + 2 = 0.375 + 2 = 2.375
- The values are different, though both are positive

The proposed answer is correct in that it satisfies the required condition (output > 0), but it's not equivalent to the ground truth answer.
