The pattern suggests the minimal total sum is achieved when the sum of values in each group (max 8, 7, 4) is balanced, considering the total constraints. To minimize the total sum, the minimal d corresponds to the number of groups necessary to sum up to 144 with the 3 large values.  
Based on enumeration, the minimal value close to the sum's lower bounds is 20, balancing the counts of each value's contributions respecting the sum constraint.  
Thus, the closed form in Lean would be:  
<<<20>>>
