Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find natural numbers A and B where:
   - B = A + 1
   - The equation B² + 2B + 3 = A² + 2A + 3 holds
   - We need to find the minimal sum A + B that satisfies these conditions

2. Simplifying the equation:
   B² + 2B = A² + 2A
   Since B = A + 1, substitute:
   (A+1)² + 2(A+1) = A² + 2A
   A² + 2A + 1 + 2A + 2 = A² + 2A
   4A + 3 = 2A
   2A = -3
   A = -1.5

3. However, A must be a natural number (ℕ), so there are no natural number solutions. But the ground truth claims 13 is the answer, which suggests there might be a different interpretation.

4. The proposed answer is 3, which would correspond to A=1, B=2:
   - Check equation: 2² + 2*2 + 3 = 1² + 2*1 + 3 → 4+4+3 = 1+2+3 → 11=6 (false)

5. The ground truth answer 13 would correspond to A=6, B=7:
   - Check equation: 7² + 2*7 + 3 = 6² + 2*6 + 3 → 49+14+3=36+12+3 → 66=51 (false)

Neither answer satisfies the given equation for natural numbers. However, if we consider the problem might have been misstated (perhaps with different coefficients), the ground truth might be referring to a different version.
