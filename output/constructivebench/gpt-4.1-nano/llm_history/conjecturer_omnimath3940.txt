The given equation resembles a sum of two cubes related to a quadratic form. Testing small positive integers suggests solutions where x and y are equal or form specific pairs, due to symmetry. Based on pattern checking, solutions include (1, 7), (7, 1), and potentially (2, 2). The form seems to focus on pairs with x = y or with values satisfying the pattern x = 7, y = 1 or vice versa. This suggests the set of solutions is exactly {(1, 7), (7, 1), (2, 2)}.
