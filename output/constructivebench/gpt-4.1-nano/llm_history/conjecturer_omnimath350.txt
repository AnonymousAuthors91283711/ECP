Given the divisibility conditions and monic polynomials over ℂ, the solutions are (z, ±i) for roots satisfying P(z)=0, Q(z)=0, with P and Q related through these roots, leading to pairs where P and Q are scalar multiples of monic factors like (X - z), (X ∓ i), with constraints ensuring divisibility.

The error arises because in Lean, when defining a set using set-builder notation with unions (∪), each set must be enclosed in braces {} separately. directly writing a union of set comprehensions without wrapping each in braces leads to syntax errors. 

Looking at the candidate answer, it defines the union of two sets, but both are written inline without wrapping them as separate set expressions. To fix the error, I need to enclose each set comprehension in braces and then union with ∪.

Additionally, considering the pattern from the enumerated answers and the problem statement, the answer likely consists of polynomials that are scalar multiples (by c ∈ ℂ) of linear factors (X - z), with the second polynomial having roots at z or -i. Because of symmetry and prior arrangements, this form matches the problem's divisibility constraints, as squaring or adding 1 produces factors involving i or -i.

Final conjecture:

<<<{
  (c * (X - z), c * (X - i)) | c ∈ ℂ, z ∈ ℂ
} ∪ {
  (c * (X - z), c * (X + i)) | c ∈ ℂ, z ∈ ℂ
}

This form ensures each set is properly enclosed, and the union is correctly expressed with braces enclosing each set, resolving the unexpected token error.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error occurs because in Lean, set notation with set comprehensions uses the syntax { x | conditions } without commas between conditions, and the comma is interpreted as a separator for multiple elements or patterns, not within the set comprehension. The current answer includes a comma before 'z ∈ ℂ', which is invalid syntax in Lean. 

Additionally, our goal is to describe the complete set of pairs (P, Q) satisfying the divisibility and monic conditions, with the structure suggested by the enumerated hints: pairs where P and Q are monic linear polynomials involving complex conjugates and roots at specific points.

Given the enumeration, the set comprises pairs where P and Q are scalar multiples of linear factors involving parameters c ∈ ℂ and roots z ∈ ℂ or ±i, i.e., the roots involved are z, i, and -i. To model this properly, and since P, Q are monic, and considering the divisibility conditions, the set naturally consists of pairs of the form:

- (c * (X - z), c * (X - i))
- (c * (X - z), c * (X + i))

with c ∈ ℂ, z ∈ ℂ. These forms satisfy the divisibility conditions because:

- For P ∣ Q² + 1: since Q is monic with root i or -i, Q² + 1 factors as (X - i)(X + i), and P can be a scalar multiple of these factors, possibly with an additional root z.

- The residual conditions on P and Q being monic and the divisibility conditions constrain their roots to the roots present in the divisibility factors.

Hence, the closed-form set is the union of these two parametric families of monic polynomials with scalar multiples.

The correction in syntax is to remove the comma after c ∈ ℂ and ensure proper set comprehension.
