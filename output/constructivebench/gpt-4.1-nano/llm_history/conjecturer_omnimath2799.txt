theorem omnimath2799 : 
  3 * n = 6 * 2 ↔ n = omnimath2799_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the biconditional \(3 * n = 6 * 2 \leftrightarrow n = \text{answer}\), the direct simplification yields \(3n = 12\) so \(n = 4\). The pattern and enumeration confirm that the unique solution is 4.
