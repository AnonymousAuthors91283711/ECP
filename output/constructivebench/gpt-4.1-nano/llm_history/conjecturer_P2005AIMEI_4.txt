The problem involves finding the maximum n such that n = k² + 5 and n = m * (m + 7). Equating m(m+7) = k² + 5, analyze solutions for integer m and k. The pattern suggests the maximum occurs for specific small values, leading to the closed form n = 49, which satisfies both forms with m=0 (n=0*7=0, not valid) or m=7 (7*14=98, k=7). The maximum n found is 98. Thus, the answer is 98.

<<<98>>>
