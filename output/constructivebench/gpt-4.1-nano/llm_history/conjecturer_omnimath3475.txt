theorem omnimath3475 (x : ℝ) (hx : x < -2) :
  IsLeast {y : ℝ | y = x ∨ y = x + 2 ∨ y = (1/2) * x ∨ y = x - 2 ∨ y = 2 * x} (omnimath3475_answer x) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
The set contains values related by addition, subtraction, multiplication, and scalar multiplication of x, indicating the minimum of y among these options. The minimal value for y, based on x < -2, is x - 2, which is always less than or equal to others when x < -2. Hence, the answer should be this minimal value.
