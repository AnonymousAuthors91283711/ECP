The pattern indicates the difference between the infimum of quadratic functions with symmetric roots involves their roots and coefficients. Since \(a, b, c\) are distinct integers in [1,11], and the functions are quadratic with roots at \(b,c\) and \(-c\), the minimal values occur at roots, leading to simplifications. The maximum difference \(d\) achieves 10 when the roots have maximal difference, symmetric about zero. 

Thus, the greatest possible difference is \(10\).

<<<10>>>
