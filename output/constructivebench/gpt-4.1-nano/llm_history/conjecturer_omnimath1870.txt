The sums of the given equations suggest a geometric relation among logs, leading to the conclusion that log y / log x simplifies to a constant ratio relating 2, 4, 8. From the pattern and symmetry, the ratio equals 3, fitting the exponential relations. Therefore, the function should reflect this ratio.
