The set includes pairs (a, b) with a > 0, b > 0, and (gcd a b)*a + b^2 = 10000.  
Since gcd a b divides 10000 - b^2, the possible gcd values are divisors of 10000.  
For consistent solutions, gcd a b likely equals 1, simplifying to a + b^2 = 10000.  
Thus, a = 10000 - b^2 with b > 0 and a > 0, b ≤ 100.  
Number of solutions = number of b in 1..100 with a > 0 ⇒ b < 100 for a > 0.  
Answer = 100 - 1 = 99.  

Final expression: <<<99>>>
