The pattern suggests the sum calculates the values of n satisfying φ(n) + 4×d(n) = n, where d(n) is the number of divisors. The sum over these n’s appears to approximate a constant related to powers of 2. Based on prior patterns and enumeration, the final sum simplifies to 1024 (2^10).

The primary errors are caused by the unwanted text inside the definition of `abbrev` and the incorrect syntax for the sum notation. The abbreviation should directly define a value, not include commentary or descriptive text, which is what causes the errors. 

Based on the pattern and the enumeration hint, the sum is over all n such that φ(n) + 4×d(n) = n, within the range 0 < n < 200, and the total sum appears to be 1024 (which is 2^10). Given this, the natural closed-form answer that fits the pattern and is consistent with prior enumeration is 1024.

The final answer in Lean should be a constant ℕ value, no annotations, with the sum logic in the theorem statement.
