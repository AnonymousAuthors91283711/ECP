theorem omnimath3384 :
  IsLeast {m : ℕ | ∀ (s1 s2 s3 : ℕ), (m + s1 + s2 + s3) / 4 = 20 → s1 < 20 ∧ s2 < 20 ∧ s3 < 20} omnimath3384_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem seeks the least m such that, for all s1, s2, s3 with (m + s1 + s2 + s3)/4 = 20, we have s1, s2, s3 < 20. This constrains the sum m + s1 + s2 + s3 to be 80. To guarantee s1, s2, s3 < 20, m must be at least enough that any s1, s2, s3 satisfying the sum constraint are less than 20, i.e., m ≥ 80 - (3*19 + 1) = 80 - 58 = 22. Therefore, the minimal such m is 22, ensuring the condition holds for all s1, s2, s3.
