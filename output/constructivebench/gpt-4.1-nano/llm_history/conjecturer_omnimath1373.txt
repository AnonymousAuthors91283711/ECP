The pattern suggests the maximum is achieved when all \(x_i\) are equal, leading to the sum \(\sum_{i=0}^{2015} x_i^2 + x_i x_{i+1}\). The maximum occurs when the ratio \(\frac{\sum_{i=0}^{2015} x_i^2 + x_i x_{i+1}}{(x_{2016})^2}\) is maximized, which, by symmetry and periodicity, occurs when all \(x_i\) are equal. Rationalizing this, the maximum value is \(\frac{2016}{2} = 1008\). Thus, the greatest number \(c\) satisfying the condition is \( \frac{2016}{2} \).
