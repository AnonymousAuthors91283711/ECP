theorem olympiadbench2500 (k : ℝ) :
    (∀ x, sin x ^ 6 + cos x ^ 6 + k * (sin x ^ 4 + cos x ^ 4) = olympiadbench2500_answer) ↔ k = olympiadbench2500_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern from enumeration suggests the value is the constant result of the trigonometric expression over all x, which simplifies to 1, as the sum of symmetric powers of sine and cosine over all x remains constant. The expression inside the theorem equates this sum to a constant, and solving for k yields a specific value.  

Given the symmetry and standard results, the answer is likely the constant value that makes the identity hold for all x, which is when k equals 2.  

Therefore, the final answer in Lean expression form is:

<<<2>>>
