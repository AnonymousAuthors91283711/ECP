theorem IMO2012SLN6 (x : ℕ) (hx : 0 < x) :
  (∀ (y n : ℕ), 0 < y → 0 < n → (2^n * y + 1) ∣ (x^(2 * n) - 1)) ↔ x = IMO2012SLN6_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the divisibility condition and the pattern in enumerated answers, the key is that the divisor's form suggests x must be small to satisfy for all y, n. The base case x=1 always holds; for larger x, divisibility fails. So, the pattern indicates the answer is 1.
