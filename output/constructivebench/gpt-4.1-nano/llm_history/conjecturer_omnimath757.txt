  n + k = 74 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
Given the pattern and the problem constraints, the maximum number m corresponds to placing 36 points with the given difference constraints, with the total n + k summing to 74. Based on the enumeration, the most consistent closed form with the maximum m (n) occurs when n is maximized likely at 36 due to the total sum.
