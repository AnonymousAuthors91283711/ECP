  P2025HMMThmic_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the symmetry and the constraints, the minimal such k must be just over 45, specifically 45 + 45 = 90, since the constructed set is symmetric about midpoint k/2 = 45, and the bijection on the intervals [n, n+44] applies for n ≤ 45, making k minimally 90. So, the answer is 90. 

<<<90>>>
