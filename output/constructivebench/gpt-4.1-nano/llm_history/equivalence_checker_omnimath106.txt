Ground Truth Answer: fun m n r s => (min (m : ℝ) (n : ℝ)) ^ (1/r - 1/s)
Proposed Answer: fun m n r s => (n^(1/r) / m^(1/s))
Let me analyze the problem and compare the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum value of a certain ratio involving matrix norms with exponents r and s.

2. The ground truth answer suggests the maximum is determined by the minimum of m and n, raised to the power (1/r - 1/s).

3. The proposed answer suggests a different form: n^(1/r) divided by m^(1/s).

Key observations:
- The ground truth answer is symmetric in m and n (due to the min function), while the proposed answer is not.
- The exponents are different: (1/r - 1/s) vs separate terms (1/r and 1/s).
- For cases where m = n, the ground truth becomes m^(1/r - 1/s), while the proposed becomes m^(1/r - 1/s), so they match in this special case.
- However, for m ≠ n, they diverge significantly.

Conclusion: The answers are only equivalent in the special case where m = n, but not in general. Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect.
