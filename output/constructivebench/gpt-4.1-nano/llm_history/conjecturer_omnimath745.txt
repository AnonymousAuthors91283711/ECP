theorem omnimath745 :
  (∑ a in range 81, ∑ b in range 81, if b ≤ a then (choose a b : ZMod 3).val else 0) / (81 * 81) = omnimath745_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The inner sum ∑_{b=0}^a (choose a b) mod 3 equals 2 when a is odd and 0 when a is even, based on binomial coefficients mod 3. Summing over a=0 to 80, the sum is (number of odd a's) times 2, as even a's contribute 0. There are 40 odd numbers between 0 and 80, so total sum = 40 * 2 = 80. Divide by 81² to normalize: 80 / (81 * 81).
