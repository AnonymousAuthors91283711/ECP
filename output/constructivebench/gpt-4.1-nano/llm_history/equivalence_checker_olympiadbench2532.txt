Ground Truth Answer: (-2, -2)
Proposed Answer: (2, -1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for real numbers (a, b) such that:
   a * (x + b * (x + 3)) = 2 * (x + 6) for all x ∈ ℝ

2. Let's expand both sides:
   Left side: a * (x + b*x + 3b) = a * ((1 + b)x + 3b) = a(1 + b)x + 3ab
   Right side: 2x + 12

3. For this to hold for all x, the coefficients must match:
   Coefficient of x: a(1 + b) = 2
   Constant term: 3ab = 12

4. Ground Truth (-2, -2):
   a(1 + b) = -2(1 - 2) = -2(-1) = 2 ✔
   3ab = 3*(-2)*(-2) = 12 ✔

5. Proposed Answer (2, -1):
   a(1 + b) = 2(1 - 1) = 0 ≠ 2 ✗
   3ab = 3*2*(-1) = -6 ≠ 12 ✗

The proposed answer fails both conditions, while the ground truth satisfies both.
