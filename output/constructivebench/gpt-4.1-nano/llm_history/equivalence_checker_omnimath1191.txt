    (x y z w : ℝ)
    (h : 2 * x + y + z + w = 1 ∧ x + 3 * y + z + w = 2 ∧ x + y + 4 * z + w = 3 ∧ x + y + z + 5 * w = 25) :

Ground Truth Answer: 11 / 2
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a system of 4 linear equations with 4 variables (x, y, z, w).
2. The ground truth answer is w = 11/2 (which is 5.5).
3. The proposed answer is w = 4.

We can see that 4 ≠ 5.5, so the answers are clearly different. The proposed answer is incorrect.
