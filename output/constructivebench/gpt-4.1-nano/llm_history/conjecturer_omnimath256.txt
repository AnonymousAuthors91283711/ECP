Since the functions f and g are bijections satisfying specific functional equations involving shifts by a and b, the pair (a, b) must represent shifts that correspond to the difference between the input and its image under these functions. The structure suggests that (a, b) encompass all possible integer shifts that satisfy the cyclic conditions, leading to the set of all pairs in ℤ×ℤ where the sum of a and b is zero for consistency with the equations’ constraints. Therefore, the set of all such pairs is precisely those with a + b = 0.
