theorem omnimath1891 :
  let divisors := Nat.divisors 2016
  let n := divisors.card
  (∑ d in divisors, (1 : ℚ)/n * (d^2 / (d^2 + 2016))) = omnimath1891_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Given the structure, the sum involves divisors of 2016, normalized by total count n, and the summand involves the ratio d^2 / (d^2 + 2016). Recognizing symmetric divisor pairs and the sum's form, the sum simplifies to 1/2, as the divisors partition the sum evenly favoring the symmetry in d^2/(d^2+2016).
