Based on the recurrence and pattern, the sequence suggests a repeated property with period 1, as the initial and 2007-th terms are equal. The pattern indicates the sequence might be constant at 1 if the initial term is 1, satisfying the recurrence.  
Therefore, the answer must be 1, the typical size of the set of such solutions.
