Ground Truth Answer: {1, 2, 3, 5}
Proposed Answer: {1, 2, 3, 4}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a set of 4 natural numbers where any permutation {a,b,c,d} of them satisfies that:
   - a*b + c*d is prime
   - a*c + b*d is prime
   - a*d + b*c is prime

2. Ground truth answer is {1,2,3,5}

3. Proposed answer is {1,2,3,4}

Let's test the proposed answer:
Take {a,b,c,d} = {1,2,3,4}
- 1*2 + 3*4 = 2 + 12 = 14 (not prime)
- 1*3 + 2*4 = 3 + 8 = 11 (prime)
- 1*4 + 2*3 = 4 + 6 = 10 (not prime)

This fails the condition since not all combinations yield primes.

The ground truth {1,2,3,5} works:
For all permutations, the sums are primes (7, 11, 13 in various combinations).
