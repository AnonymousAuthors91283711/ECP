theorem omnimath1218 :
  Finset.card (univ.filter fun (committee : Finset (Fin 10)) => 
    committee.card = 5 ∧ ∃ (leaders : Finset (Fin 10)), 
      leaders ⊆ committee ∧ 1 ≤ leaders.card ∧ leaders.card ≤ 4) = omnimath1218_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem counts 5-element committees with at least one leader subset of size 1 to 4, which always contains at least one leader. Since choosing any 5 out of 10 ensures this, the answer is the total 5-combinations: C(10,5) = 252.
