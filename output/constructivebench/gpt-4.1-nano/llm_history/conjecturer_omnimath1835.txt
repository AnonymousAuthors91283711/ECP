theorem omnimath1835 (n : ℤ) :
    (∃ (a b c : ℕ), a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ c > 0 ∧ (a : ℝ)^(n : ℝ) + (b : ℝ)^(n : ℝ) = (c : ℝ)^(n : ℝ)) ↔ n ∈ omnimath1835_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℤ
The problem asks for values of n for which there exist positive integers a, b, c satisfying \(a^n + b^n = c^n\). Known from Fermat's Last Theorem, there's no such solutions for n > 2, but for n = 1 and n = 2, solutions do exist. Thus, the answer set should be {1, 2}.
