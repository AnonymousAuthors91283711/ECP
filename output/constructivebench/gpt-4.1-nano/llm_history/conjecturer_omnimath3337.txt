theorem omnimath3337 : 
  (∃ (x : ℝ), x = (2 + sqrt 5) ^ (1/3) + (2 - sqrt 5) ^ (1/3) ∧ x = omnimath3337_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The expression suggests dealing with sums of cube roots involving conjugates, which often simplify to rational numbers or quadratic expressions. The pattern indicates that the sum equals a rational number. Notice that (2 + sqrt 5)^(1/3) + (2 - sqrt 5)^(1/3) is symmetric and likely simplifies to 1, based on the structure of similar roots. Therefore, the answer should be the rational sum 1.
