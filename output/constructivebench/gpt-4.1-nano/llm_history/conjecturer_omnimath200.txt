theorem omnimath200 (m n : ℤ) (hm : m ≠ 0) (hn : n ≠ 0) :
    (m^2 + n) * (m + n^2) = (m - n)^3 ↔ (m, n) ∈ omnimath200_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ)
Based on pattern recognition, the key relation is (m - n)^3 = (m^2 + n)(m + n^2). Set (m, n) satisfying this can be expressed explicitly. The structure suggests the solutions are parametrized by integer solutions where the relation holds when (m, n) = (a + b, a^2 + b) with some constraints to satisfy the relation. The minimal form demonstrates the solutions are characterized by parameters, simplifying to pairs where m = some linear function of n and vice versa. 

Final answer:
<<<{(m, n) | ∃ a b : ℤ, m = a + b ∧ n = a^2 + b}>>>
