Given the sum ∑' n, (cos θ)^(2n) = 5, it's a geometric series with ratio r = (cos θ)^2. The sum of an infinite geometric series with |r|<1 is 1/(1−r), so 1/(1−(cos θ)^2) = 5, yielding (cos θ)^2 = 4/5. Using the double-angle formula cos 2θ = 2(cos θ)^2 − 1, substitute (cos θ)^2 = 4/5: cos (2θ) = 2*(4/5) − 1 = 8/5 − 1 = 3/5. So,

<<<fun θ => 3/5>>>
