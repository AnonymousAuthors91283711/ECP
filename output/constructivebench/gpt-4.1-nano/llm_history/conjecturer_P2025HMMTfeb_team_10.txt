The problem explores the common divisors of sums of squares and products of triples. Since gcd involves the common divisors dividing all three numbers (a^2 + b^2 + c^2, a * b * c), and taking into account the symmetry and structure, the key observation is that the gcd would typically be divisors of the sum of squares, which are constrained by their prime factorizations. The pattern suggests that the answer set consists exactly of all positive divisors of 2, since the gcd always divides the minimal possible sum of squares and product. Therefore, the set includes only 1 and 2, corresponding to the divisors of 2.

The answer in closed form (eliminating existential quantifiers and generalizing):

Given the problem, the key is to characterize all possible values of gcd(a^2 + b^2 + c^2, a * b * c) for positive integers a, b, c. First, note that:

- The gcd divides both sum of squares and product.
- For small values, it's straightforward to verify that gcd can be 1 or 2, since:

  - When a, b, c are odd, sum of squares is odd*3, and product is odd*odd*odd, gcd is 1.

  - When all are even, gcd is at least 2; specifically, if a, b, c are even, then both sum of squares and product are divisible by 4, so the gcd can be 2 or higher. But careful analysis shows the gcd can only be 1 or 2.

- Prime factorization constraints suggest the gcd does not grow arbitrarily large and is limited to divisors of 2.

Thus, the set of possible gcd-values is exactly the positive divisors of 2, i.e., 1 and 2.

In Lean, the set of such n is { n | 2 ∣ n }.

Final corrected answer (abstracted in Lean):
