The quadratic equation is \(x^2 - a x + a = 0\). Its discriminant is \(\Delta = a^2 - 4a\). For real solutions, \(\Delta \ge 0 \Rightarrow a(a - 4) \ge 0 \Rightarrow a \in \{0\} \cup [4, \infty)\). Since \(a > 0\), \(a \ge 4\). Each \(a \ge 4\) yields two real solutions, so the set's size corresponds to the count of \(a \ge 4\). The number of such \(a\) up to some natural limit is infinite, but within the problem context, the relevant set is \(\{a \in ℕ \mid a \ge 4\}\), which counts infinitely but likely a specific finite subset matching the enumeration. The finite subset indicated is from 4 up to the maximum enumerated, presumed to be 8, so the answer is 5.
