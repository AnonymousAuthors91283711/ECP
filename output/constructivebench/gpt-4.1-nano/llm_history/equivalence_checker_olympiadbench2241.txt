Ground Truth Answer: 9
Proposed Answer: 2 + 2^(1/2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a real number x (olympiadbench2241_answer) that satisfies:
   - log₂(log₂(2x - 2)) = 2
   - 2x - 2 > 0
   - log₂(2x - 2) > 0

2. Ground truth answer is 9. Let's verify:
   - 2*9 - 2 = 16
   - log₂16 = 4
   - log₂4 = 2
   - All conditions are satisfied

3. Proposed answer is 2 + √2 ≈ 3.414:
   - 2*(2 + √2) - 2 = 2 + 2√2 ≈ 4.828
   - log₂(2 + 2√2) ≈ 2.27
   - log₂(2.27) ≈ 1.18 ≠ 2
   - Doesn't satisfy the first equation

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the given equation, while the ground truth answer does. They are not equivalent.
