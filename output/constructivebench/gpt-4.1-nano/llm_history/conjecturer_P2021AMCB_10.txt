theorem P2021AMCB_10 :
  ∃ (x y : ℕ), x ∈ Finset.Icc 1 37 ∧ y ∈ Finset.Icc 1 37 ∧ x ≠ y ∧ 
  (∑ i in (Finset.Icc 1 37 \ {x, y}), i) = x * y ∧ 
  y - x = P2021AMCB_10_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern indicates the sum of the set from 1 to 37 excluding two numbers x and y equals x * y, with the difference y - x being the answer. Since for x ≠ y, summing from 1 to 37 minus x and y yields x * y only when x and y are close together, the likely minimal difference is 1. Hence, the difference y - x is 1.
