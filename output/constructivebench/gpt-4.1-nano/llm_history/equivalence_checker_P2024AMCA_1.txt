abbrev P2024AMCA_1_answer : â„• := sorry
theorem P2024AMCA_1 :
  9901 * 101 - 99 * 10101 = P2024AMCA_1_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: 998
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to compute the value of 9901 * 101 - 99 * 10101
2. Let's calculate this step by step:
   - 9901 * 101 = 9901 * (100 + 1) = 990100 + 9901 = 1,000,001
   - 99 * 10101 = (100 - 1) * 10101 = 1,010,100 - 10,101 = 999,999
   - 1,000,001 - 999,999 = 2

3. The ground truth answer is 2, which matches our calculation
4. The proposed answer is 998, which is incorrect

<<<False>>>
