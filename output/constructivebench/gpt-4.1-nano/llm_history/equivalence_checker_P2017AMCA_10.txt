Ground Truth Answer: 3 / 4
Proposed Answer: (2017 * 4034) / (2 * 2017 * 4034)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about calculating the ratio of two areas in ℝ²:
   - Numerator: Area where y > x (P)
   - Denominator: Area of rectangle [0,2017]×[0,4034]

2. Ground truth answer is 3/4, which makes sense because:
   - Total rectangle area = 2017 × 4034
   - The line y = x divides the rectangle into two parts
   - For x ∈ [0,2017], y ranges from x to 4034
   - The area where y > x is (2017 × 4034) - (½ × 2017 × 2017)
   - The ratio would be [2017×4034 - ½×2017²]/(2017×4034) = 1 - (2017/(2×4034)) = 3/4

3. Proposed answer simplifies to:
   (2017 × 4034)/(2 × 2017 × 4034) = 1/2

The proposed answer of 1/2 is incorrect as it doesn't account for the full geometry of the problem. The correct ratio is indeed 3/4.
