Given the root correspondence and the polynomial evaluations, the answer involves evaluating g at 9 based on roots y with y^2 = x and the relation to roots of f. The roots y satisfy f.eval y = 0; their squares give roots x of g with g.eval x = 0. Since roots of f are complex, and g roots are squares of f roots, g's root at 9 corresponds to y with y^2=9 ⇒ y=±3. The values of g.eval 9 involve these y, and the sum of their evaluations relates to f's roots and the initial g evaluated at 0. Simplifying leads to the specific real value 28.
