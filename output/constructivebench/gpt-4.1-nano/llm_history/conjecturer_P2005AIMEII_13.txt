Given the conditions on P, the points where P(n) = n + 3 are exactly at n₁ and n₂, and for all n where P(n) = n + 3, n = n₁ or n = n₂. To satisfy P(17) = 10 and P(24) = 17, and with the uniqueness of these points, the polynomial seems linear between these points, leading to an intercepts and slopes suggesting n₁ and n₂ as roots of the polynomial transformation. Based on the pattern, the product n₁ * n₂ aligns with the quadratic relation of the form -k, where k matches the value based on the polynomial's structure. 

The explicit closed form based on the enumeration pattern is:
