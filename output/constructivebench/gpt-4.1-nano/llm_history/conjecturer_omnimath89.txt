The pattern in enumerated answer suggests the minimal k with the described property is 3, since for k=1 or 2 the conditions don't hold universally, but at k=3, the property is satisfied by subsets of size 3 involving elements like 1, 2, 3, with the necessary divisibility conditions. 

Therefore, the answer is:

<<<3>>>
