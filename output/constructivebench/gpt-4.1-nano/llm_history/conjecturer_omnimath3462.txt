Based on the pattern in the enumerated answers and the conditions: answer not divisible by 3, not a perfect square, and the sum of its decimal digits is prime. A candidate that fits these criteria is 10. It’s not divisible by 3, not a perfect square, and the sum of digits (1+0=1) is not prime; so instead, choose 29: not divisible by 3, not a perfect square, sum of digits=2+9=11 prime. Using these observations, the simplest consistent choice is 29.
