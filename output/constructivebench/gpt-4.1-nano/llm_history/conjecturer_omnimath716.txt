The set of primes p satisfying the conditions involves three distinct integers a, b, c with 0 ≤ a < b < c, all with polynomial evaluations at these points being integers with denominator 1, and p dividing these evaluations' absolute numerator parts, with p < c/3. Given the pattern and symmetry, the minimal such prime p that divides all three must be 2, as 2 divides all even numerators and denominators. Thus, the set's size, represented by the number of such primes, is 1.
