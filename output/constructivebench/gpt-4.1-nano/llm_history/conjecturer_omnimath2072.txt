The problem involves four points in 3D Euclidean space, with pairwise distances of 1 and an inequality involving a point p's squared distances to these points. The maximum sum of squared distances from p occurs when p is at the centroid of the points, with the four points forming a regular tetrahedron of side 1, centered at the origin.

The squared distance from the centroid to each vertex is 3/4, and the sum over four vertices is 4 * (3/4) = 3.

Thus, the maximum sum of squared distances is 3, so the measure equals the volume of the circumscribed sphere of such a tetrahedron with radius sqrt(3/8), leading to a volume of (4/3) * pi * (sqrt(3/8))^3.

Calculating yields volume = (π * sqrt(3)) / 6.

Answer:

<<<(π * sqrt(3)) / 6>>>

The error suggests that the syntax `(π * sqrt(3)) / 6` is problematic in Lean, likely because of the parentheses around `3)` which is unexpected. In Lean, arithmetic expressions directly involving `π` and `sqrt(3)` should not include parentheses around constants unless necessary, and parentheses are handled differently in its syntax. 

Given the pattern in enumerations, the answer is a simple rational multiple of π times sqrt(3). Therefore, the correct Lean syntax should omit the parentheses around `3`. 

Proposed correction: write `π * sqrt 3 / 6`. This form avoids unexpected parentheses and aligns with Lean's parsing rules.

The answer should be a closed-form expression of real numbers, reflecting perhaps a known volume calculation involving equilateral configurations or sphere packings in 3D with four points around a center, resulting in some fraction of π*sqrt(3). 

Thus, the fixed answer in Lean is:

<<<π * sqrt 3 / 6>>>

This is a typical form for volumes related to regular tetrahedral configurations scaled by factor involving √3, consistent with combinatorial geometry in 3D space.
