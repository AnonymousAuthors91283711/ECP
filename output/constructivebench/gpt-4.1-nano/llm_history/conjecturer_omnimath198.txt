The product (a + b)(b + c)(c + d)(d + e)(e + a) simplifies maximally when the variables are equal, subject to the sum constraint a + b + c + d + e = 5 with each ≥ -1.

Equal assignment: a = b = c = d = e = 1 satisfies the sum constraint and maximizes/minimizes the product, leading to the range [ (1+1)^5, (1+1)^5 ]. 

Calculating, (a + b) = 2; thus max product: 2^5 = 32.

Similarly, minimal occurs at the bounds with -1, leading to (a + b) = 0 for variables set accordingly, resulting in 0.

Hence, the answer set is [0, 32].

The final answer expression:

<<<(0, 32)>>>
