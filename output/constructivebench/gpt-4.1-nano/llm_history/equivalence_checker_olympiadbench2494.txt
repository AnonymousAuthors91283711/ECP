Ground Truth Answer: {1}
Proposed Answer: {a : ℝ | a = sqrt 3}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a set of real numbers 'a' for which there exist real numbers x,y satisfying two trigonometric equations involving a.

2. The ground truth answer is {1}, meaning only a=1 satisfies the conditions.

3. The proposed answer is {a : ℝ | a = sqrt 3}, meaning only a=√3 satisfies the conditions.

To check equivalence:
- The two answers are clearly different as 1 ≠ √3
- We can verify the ground truth by testing a=1:
  For a=1, the equations become:
  sin²x + cos²y = 3/2 (which cannot be true since maximum value is 1+1=2, but 3/2 is within range)
  cos²x + sin²y = 1/2 (which is possible)
  So a=1 is indeed a solution
- For a=√3:
  First equation would require sin²x + cos²y = 3√3/2 ≈ 2.598
  But maximum possible value is 2 (when sin²x=1 and cos²y=1)
  2.598 > 2, so no solution exists for a=√3

The proposed answer is incorrect as it suggests a non-solution (√3) while missing the actual solution (1).
