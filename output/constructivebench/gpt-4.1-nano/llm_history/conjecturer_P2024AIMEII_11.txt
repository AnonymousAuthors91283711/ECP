theorem P2024AIMEII_11 :
  {(a, b, c) : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ | a + b + c = 300}.ncard = P2024AIMEII_11_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Because the sum \(a + b + c = 300\) with \(a,b,c \in ℕ\), the count of such triples (assuming nonnegative integers) is given by the stars-and-bars formula: \(\binom{300 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{302}{2}\). Simplify: \(\frac{302 \times 301}{2}\). 

Hence, expression: <<<302 * 301 / 2>>>
