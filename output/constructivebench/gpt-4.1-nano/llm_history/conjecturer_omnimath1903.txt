From the pattern, the minimal length n that satisfies the conditions relates to the Fibonacci growth, where the sequence's sum >= 2018 with initial values and rules corresponds to the Fibonacci sequence. The minimal n is the index where Fibonacci(n+2) surpasses or equals 2018. The Fibonacci(12)=144 and Fibonacci(13)=233, and Fibonacci(15)=610, Fibonacci(16)=987, Fibonacci(17)=1597, Fibonacci(18)=2584 >= 2018. Therefore, the minimal n is 17.

The main issue is that the proposer used natural language and commentary directly in the answer expression, resulting in invalid Lean syntax with the identifier 'From' and the descriptive sentence. To fix this, I will Remove any non-code comments and replace the entire answer with a closed-form natural number expression derived from the reasoning, noting the minimal n corresponds to the index where Fibonacci numbers surpass 2018, which is at n=17.

Given the Fibonacci sequence: Fib(12)=144, Fib(13)=233, Fib(14)=377, Fib(15)=610, Fib(16)=987, Fib(17)=1597, Fib(18)=2584.

Since the sum (or the relevant process) surpasses 2018 at index 18, but noting the problem's pattern and hints, the minimal sequence length satisfying the conditions is associated with n=17, the last Fibonacci term less than 2018.

Therefore, the value is simply 17.

Here is the fixed answer in Lean syntax:
