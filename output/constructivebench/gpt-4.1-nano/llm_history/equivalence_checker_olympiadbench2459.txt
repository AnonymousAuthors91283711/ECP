Ground Truth Answer: fun x => x + 22
Proposed Answer: fun x => -x + 44
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a linear function f(x) = a*x + b where:
   - a ≠ 0
   - f(x) - f⁻¹(x) = 44 for all x

2. For the ground truth f(x) = x + 22:
   - The inverse is f⁻¹(x) = x - 22
   - f(x) - f⁻¹(x) = (x + 22) - (x - 22) = 44

3. For the proposed answer f(x) = -x + 44:
   - The inverse is f⁻¹(x) = -x + 44 (same function)
   - f(x) - f⁻¹(x) = (-x + 44) - (-x + 44) = 0 ≠ 44

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the condition f(x) - f⁻¹(x) = 44, while the ground truth does.
