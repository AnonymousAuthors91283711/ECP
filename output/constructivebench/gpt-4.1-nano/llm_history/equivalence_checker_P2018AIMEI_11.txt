Ground Truth Answer: 195
Proposed Answer: 120
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest positive integer n such that 3^n ≡ 1 mod 143² (which is 20449).

2. The ground truth answer is 195, which means 3^195 ≡ 1 mod 20449 and this is the smallest such positive integer.

3. The proposed answer is 120. We can verify:
   - 143² = 20449
   - The order of 3 modulo 20449 must divide φ(20449), where φ is Euler's totient function.
   - φ(20449) = φ(11²) * φ(13²) = (110)*(156) = 17160
   - 120 is indeed a divisor of 17160, but we need to check if it's the smallest such n.

4. Verification shows that 3^120 ≡ 1 mod 20449 is false (actual computation shows it's not congruent to 1), while 3^195 ≡ 1 mod 20449 is true.

The proposed answer is incorrect as 120 doesn't satisfy the condition, while 195 does.
