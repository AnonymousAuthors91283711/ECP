Ground Truth Answer: {t | t < 1/2}
Proposed Answer: { r : ℝ | r < 1 }
Let me analyze this problem and the answers carefully.

The problem is about determining for which values of t there exists an infinite set X of real numbers where for any three points x,y,z in X and any arithmetic progression a-d, a, a+d, the maximum deviation from this progression is greater than t*d.

The ground truth answer states that this holds when t < 1/2, while the proposed answer claims it holds when t < 1.

Key observations:
1. The condition requires that no three points in X can be too close to any arithmetic progression.
2. For t ≥ 1/2, we can find counterexamples (like X being an arithmetic progression itself).
3. The proposed answer t < 1 is too lenient - there exist configurations where t between 1/2 and 1 would fail the condition.

The proposed answer is incorrect because it allows values of t that are too large (up to 1 instead of up to 1/2). The ground truth correctly identifies the tight bound.
