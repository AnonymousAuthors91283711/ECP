The pattern suggests that the total root count is 2006, and the real roots count is 1006, leaving complex roots (non-real) with count 2006 - 1006 = 1000. Since the roots are counted with multiplicity, the minimal real roots count is 1006, which extends to the least possible total root count maintaining this property. Therefore, the answer should be the total number of roots, i.e., 2006.
