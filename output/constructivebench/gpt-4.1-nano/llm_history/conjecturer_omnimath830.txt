Since the problem involves a collection T of subsets of Fin 3 that is closed under union and intersection, the key is to find the maximal cardinality for such a set. The power set of Fin 3 has 8 elements, but subsets must be closed under union and intersection, which limits possibilities to a Boolean algebra. The maximal size of a Boolean algebra of subsets of a 3-element set is 8, which is the full power set. Therefore, the answer is 8.

The errors in the current proposed answer stem from attempting to write a verbose explanation directly as an expression for `omnimath830_answer`, which Lean interprets as an invalid expression due to syntax issues. To fix this, I should replace the verbose explanation with a concise, closed-form natural number in Lean syntax, reflecting the maximal size of such a collection T.

From the problem description, the key insight is that the collection T of subsets of Fin 3 closed under union and intersection, including the initial set, forms a boolean algebra. The largest Boolean algebra over a 3-element set has size 8, which is the size of the entire power set. Therefore, the maximum possible value for the card of T is 8.

---

Explanation: The maximum size of a set of subsets of a 3-element set that is closed under union and intersection is the power set itself, which has size 8.

Final answer in Lean:

<<<8>>>
