The problem asks for the total number of triples \((a, b, c)\) within bounds such that there exists a \(d\) making \(g\) vanish at \(f(2)\) and \(f(4)\), with \(\abs a, \abs b, \abs c \le 10\). The enumeration pattern indicates the count is based on the:

- number of integer choices for \((a, b, c)\)
- the number of compatible \(d\)

Based on the pattern analysis, the total count simplifies to the total combinations over \((a, c)\) and possible solutions for \(d\), summing over these:
