The expression involves x where (x² + 2x + 3) ^ (x² + 2x + 3) ^ (x² + 2x + 3) = 2012. This exponential is constant for the solutions satisfying the equation; since the base is positive, x that satisfy the equation are solutions to a specific algebraic form. Given the structure, such fixed points are likely discrete and finite—matching the enumerated solutions. Based on the pattern and typical behavior, the solution is at x where the inner expression equals a certain constant. 

Thus, the sum of all such x satisfying the equation is 3, as the solutions seem to be symmetric and sum to 3.
