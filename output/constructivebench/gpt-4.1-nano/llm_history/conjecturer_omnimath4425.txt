Since the divisibility condition involves exponential functions and the difference between a and b, for the set {n | 0 < n ∧ (a^n + b^n) ∣ (a^(n+1) + b^(n+1))} to be infinite, the ratio a/b must be a root of unity or related to a specific pattern. Based on the pattern and typical solutions involving such division properties, the answer likely involves a special case where a/b is a root of unity, such as 1 (i.e., a = b), but the problem states a ≠ b. The natural constant solutions arise when the ratio is -1. 

Hence, the final answer probably states that a and b are positive, distinct, and satisfy the relation such that the ratio is -1, leading to an infinite divisor set.

In this formalization, the core idea is that the set {n | 0 < n ∧ (a^n + b^n) ∣ (a^(n+1) + b^(n+1))} is infinite under very specific conditions relating to the ratio a/b. Given the divisibility pattern, the most natural candidates are roots of unity or situations where the sequence exhibits periodic behavior.

From algebraic considerations, for large n, (a^n + b^n) divides (a^{n+1} + b^{n+1}) if and only if a/b satisfies certain algebraic relations ensuring the divisibility repeats infinitely often. Recognizing typical patterns, this is especially prominent when a and b are positive real numbers, and the ratio is -1, which alternates signs and maintains divisibility.

Given the problem's constraints (a ≠ b, both positive), the only promising candidate satisfying the infinite divisibility condition appears when the ratio is -1. Under this assumption, the divisibility pattern repeats infinitely often, as (a^n + b^n) alternates signs in a pattern that ensures the divisibility criterion holds infinitely many n.

Hence, the concise formal statement capturing the key idea is: "There exist positive reals a and b with a ≠ b, and the ratio a/b = -1, such that the set of n with the given divisibility property is infinite."

In Lean, the correct formalized answer is:

<<<∃ a b : ℝ, 0 < a ∧ 0 < b ∧ a ≠ b ∧ (a / b) = -1>>>>>
