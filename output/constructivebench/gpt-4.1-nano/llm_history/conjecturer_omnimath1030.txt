The recurrence relation suggests that the sequence a(n) satisfies certain quadratic properties. The set involves indices m ≥ 2005 where (a(m+1) - 1) divides (a m)^2 - 1, which factors into (a m - 1)(a m + 1). A pattern hints that the minimal such m is 2005, since the initial conditions lead the divisibility to hold at the earliest m = 2005.
