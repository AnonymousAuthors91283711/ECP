theorem omnimath1861 :
  let students := 36
  let multiples : Finset ℕ := {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
  let totalPairs := students * students
  let sameMultiplePairs := ∑ k in multiples, (k : ℚ) * k
  let samePersonPairs := ∑ k in multiples, (k : ℚ)

Ground Truth Answer: 3/17
Proposed Answer: (1 : ℚ) / 4
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating a probability ratio where:
   - There are 36 students
   - We're considering multiples from 1 to 8
   - totalPairs = 36*36 = 1296
   - sameMultiplePairs = sum of k² for k from 1 to 8 = 204
   - samePersonPairs = sum of k for k from 1 to 8 = 36

2. The ratio being calculated is samePersonPairs/sameMultiplePairs = 36/204 = 3/17 when simplified

3. The ground truth answer is indeed 3/17, which matches our calculation

4. The proposed answer is 1/4, which does not equal 3/17 (since 3/17 ≈ 0.176 and 1/4 = 0.25)

<<<False>>>
