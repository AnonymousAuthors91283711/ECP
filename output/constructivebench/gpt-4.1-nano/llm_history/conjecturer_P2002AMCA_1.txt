abbrev P2002AMCA_1_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2002AMCA_1 : 
  (roots ((2 * X + 3) * (X - 4) + (2 * X + 3) * (X - 6))).sum = P2002AMCA_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The roots are from (2X+3)(X-4) + (2X+3)(X-6) = 0, factoring yields (2X+3)(2X - 10) = 0, giving roots X = -3/2 and X = 5. Sum = (-3/2) + 5 = 7/2.
