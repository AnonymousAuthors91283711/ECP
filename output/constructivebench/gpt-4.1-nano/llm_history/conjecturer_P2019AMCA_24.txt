The pattern suggests the answer involves the largest \( n \) in the range where divisibility holds, often approaching \( 50 \). Since factorial divisibility of \((n^2)! \) by \((n!)^n\) deteriorates for larger \( n \), the largest \( n \) up to 50 satisfying the divisibility condition is expected to be 49, as divisibility fails at 50. Hence, the answer may be 49.

<<<49>>>
