Since the sum resembles the generating function for central binomial coefficients, the closed-form sum is known:

Sum_{n≥0} Binomial(2n, n) (x^n) = 1/√(1 - 4x), for |x|<1.

Plugging x=1/5 gives:

Sum_{n≥0} Binomial(2n, n) (1/5)^n = 1/√(1 - 4/5) = 1/√(1/5) = √5.

Thus, the answer is:

<<<(√5 : ℝ)>>>
