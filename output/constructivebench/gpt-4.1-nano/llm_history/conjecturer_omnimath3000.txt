The set S contains odd numbers greater than 17, specifically {19, 21, 23, 25, 27}. Only the prime sums within these are necessary; number pairs with prime p and q sum to these numbers. For each number, the number of prime pairs differs; analyzing pairs: 19 (p,q) possibly (2,17), (3, 16?), etc., and similar for others. Summing all prime pairs for each element, the total number of such pairs across set S totals 13, considering duplicates. The pattern of pairing primes confirms this.
