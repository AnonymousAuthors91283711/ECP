Ground Truth Answer: 117649
Proposed Answer: 7^7
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves a 7th degree polynomial P = X^7 - 7 with distinct roots r_i (since i ≠ j → r_i ≠ r_j).

2. We're asked to find K^2 where K is defined as a double product of sums of roots (r_i + r_j) for i < j.

3. The ground truth answer is 117649, which is exactly 7^7 (since 7^7 = 823543, but 117649 is actually 7^6).

Wait, this seems incorrect. Let me check:
- 7^7 = 7 × 7 × 7 × 7 × 7 × 7 × 7 = 823543
- 117649 = 7^6

But the proposed answer is 7^7 (823543), which doesn't match the ground truth (117649).

However, looking deeper at the problem:
- The polynomial X^7 - 7 has roots that are 7th roots of 7.
- The product K involves sums of roots (r_i + r_j).
- The square of this product K^2 should indeed be 7^6 = 117649, not 7^7.

Therefore, the proposed answer (7^7) is incorrect - it should be 7^6.
