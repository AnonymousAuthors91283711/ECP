  olympiadbench2709_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Because the constraints involve linear inequalities and the minimal m = 25 * p with p > 0, the smallest positive p is p = 1, leading to m = 25 * 1 = 25.  
Thus, the minimal m satisfying all constraints corresponds to p = 1, a minimal positive value.  
Final answer is 25.
