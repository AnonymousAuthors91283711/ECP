The sequence pattern suggests that for the minimal s satisfying the recursive condition, the sequence stabilizes at a value related to sqrt(2009). Since the recurrence resembles quadratic solutions, the minimal s is likely y = (1/2) * (1 + sqrt(1 + 4 * 2009)).

Calculating 1 + 4*2009 = 1 + 8036 = 8037. The approximate sqrt(8037) ≈ 89.7, leading to s ≈ (1 + 89.7)/2 ≈ 45.35. The minimal integer s fulfilling the condition is therefore 45.

Answer: <<<45>>>
