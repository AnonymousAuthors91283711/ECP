Given the pattern and the constraints, the function resembles a linear form that satisfies all positivity and quadratic product conditions. The simplest consistent solution aligning with the properties is $f(n) = n$, which makes $f(1)+f(2)=3$, and satisfies the equation with a square product at 2015 and 2016, as $f(2015)*f(2016)=2015*2016= (2015)(2016)$ which is a perfect square of 2016. The least such sum is thus 3.
