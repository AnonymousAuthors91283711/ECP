The set consists of perfect squares dividing the product of factorials from 1 to 9. The smallest such squares are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, which appear as squares of integers 1 to 9; composite squares like 100 or above do not divide the product. The total count of such perfect squares is 9.
