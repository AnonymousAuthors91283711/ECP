Since the recurrence relation is symmetric and linear, with initial conditions f(1)=1, f(2)=3, the pattern suggests a linear combination of powers. Solving the recurrence yields f(x)=a·2^x + b·(−1)^x. By substituting initial values, we find a=1/2 and b=1/2, leading to f(x)= (2^x + (−1)^x)/2. For x=2008, (−1)^{2008}=1, so the function equals (2^{2008} + 1)/2. 

Answer:
<<<(2^2008 + 1) / 2>>>
