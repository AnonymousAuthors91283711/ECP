The pattern indicates the defining property is m + n = 10 with m, n > 0, and the set of n corresponds to those satisfying this with some m. The maximum n occurs when m = 1, so n = 9.

Given the problem, the set described by P involves pairs (m,n) where m > 0, n > 0, and their average (m + n)/2 equals 5. From this, (m + n) = 10, with m, n ≥ 1, and both integers. The set of n such that there exists an m with these conditions is the set of integers n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 9, because for each such n, we can find an m to satisfy m + n = 10, i.e., m = 10 - n, which is positive for n ≤ 9. 

Thus, the set of n's satisfying the condition is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. The maximum (greatest) element is 9. So, the answer is simply 9.

The initial proposal `<9` is invalid syntax in Lean, because it uses angle brackets. The correct syntax for a constant is just `9`. The "Optionally write your explanations" point suggests we just need the numeric answer as an expression.

Therefore, the final answer is just the number 9, which matches the enumerated answer and is acceptable as a closed-form in Lean.

<<<9>>>

**Summary of reasoning**: The set’s elements are all n where n + m = 10, with positive m,n, leading to n ∈ {1,...,9} and maximum n being 9.
