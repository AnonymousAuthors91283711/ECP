abbrev omnimath328_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath328 (n : ℕ) (h : 3 ≤ n) :
  (∀ (a : Fin n → ℝ), (∀ i, 0 < a i) → (∀ i, a i ≤ n * ⨅ j, a j) →
    ∃ i j k : Fin n, i ≠ j ∧ j ≠ k ∧ i ≠ k ∧ a i + a j > a k ∧ a i^2 + a j^2 > a k^2) ↔ n ∈ omnimath328_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests the contradiction appears primarily at n=4, where the property does not hold. For n≥4, the property holds, aligning with the enumerated answer focusing on n=4. Therefore, the answer is the singleton set {4}.
