Ground Truth Answer: 4096
Proposed Answer: 256
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n > 0 where the floor of n^(1/k) is distinct for all k ∈ {1,2,...,8} when k ≠ l.

2. The ground truth answer is 4096. Let's verify this:
   - For k=1: 4096^(1/1) = 4096 → floor = 4096
   - k=2: 4096^(1/2) ≈ 64 → floor = 64
   - k=3: 4096^(1/3) ≈ 16 → floor = 16
   - k=4: 4096^(1/4) ≈ 8 → floor = 8
   - k=5: 4096^(1/5) ≈ 5.03 → floor = 5
   - k=6: 4096^(1/6) ≈ 4 → floor = 4
   - k=7: 4096^(1/7) ≈ 3.28 → floor = 3
   - k=8: 4096^(1/8) ≈ 2.828 → floor = 2
   All floor values are distinct.

3. The proposed answer is 256. Let's check:
   - k=1: 256^(1/1) = 256
   - k=2: 256^(1/2) = 16
   - k=3: 256^(1/3) ≈ 6.35 → floor = 6
   - k=4: 256^(1/4) = 4
   - k=5: 256^(1/5) ≈ 3.03 → floor = 3
   - k=6: 256^(1/6) ≈ 2.52 → floor = 2
   - k=7: 256^(1/7) ≈ 2.20 → floor = 2
   - k=8: 256^(1/8) = 2
   Here, floor values for k=6,7,8 all equal 2, violating the condition.

The proposed answer fails to satisfy the problem's conditions, while the ground truth answer works correctly.
