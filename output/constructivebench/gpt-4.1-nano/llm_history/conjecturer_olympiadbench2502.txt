    (hf : ∀ k x, f k x = Real.sin x ^ 6 + Real.cos x ^ 6 + k * (Real.sin x ^ 4 + Real.cos x ^ 4)) :
    {k : ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, f k c = 0} = olympiadbench2502_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
Since f k c = 0 implies c can be expressed in terms of k, and the key trigonometric identity reduces the expression, the set is determined by the relationship k = - (sin c)^2 - (cos c)^2, which simplifies to constants independent of c. Therefore, the solution set includes the specific values of k where the function vanishes for some c, i.e., for k = - (sin c)^4 - (cos c)^4, which range within [-1, 1].
