theorem omnimath3134
(P Q R S : ℝ)
(hPQ : Q - P = 1)
(hQR : R - Q = 2 * (Q - P))
(hRS : S - R = 3 * (R - Q))
: S - P = omnimath3134_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Since Q - P = 1, R - Q = 2 * 1 = 2, and S - R = 3 * 2 = 6, summing these differences: S - P = (Q - P) + (R - Q) + (S - R) = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9.  
Thus, the answer is 9.
