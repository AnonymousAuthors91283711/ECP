Based on the pattern in the enumerated answers and the conditions involving a/c and b/d ratios, the set of M satisfying isGood corresponds to those with a certain ratio less than 1, while isBad corresponds to ratios ≥ 1. Since a*d = b*c imposes that a/b = c/d, the critical boundary is at ratio 1, and the extremum likely occurs at M = 0 or M = 49. Considering the pattern, the greatest M satisfying isGood is 0, and the least M satisfying isBad is 1. The boundary likely corresponds to M = 0.
