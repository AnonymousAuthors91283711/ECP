theorem P2024HMMTnov_gen_3 :
  IsLeast {s : ℕ | ∃ (a b c : ℕ), a ≠ b ∧ a ≠ c ∧ b ≠ c ∧ 0 < a ∧ 0 < b ∧ 0 < c ∧ a^b * b^c = a^c ∧ s = a + b + c} 
  P2024HMMTnov_gen_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Because the equation \(a^b \cdot b^c = a^c\) implies specific relations between \(a, b, c\), the minimal sum \(a + b + c\) occurs for the smallest positive integers satisfying the inequality and conditions. The smallest such triplet is \((a, b, c) = (2, 1, 1)\), with sum 4.  
Final answer:  
<<<4>>>
