Based on the pattern observed, the answer seems to involve a quadratic function balancing the key functional equation. The only suitable closed-form solution that aligns with the functional identity involves a quadratic form with parameters satisfying the equation to reduce to a constant or linear solution. Given the pattern and standard solving methods, you can conjecture the answer as: 

<<<fun x : ℝ => x + 1>>>
