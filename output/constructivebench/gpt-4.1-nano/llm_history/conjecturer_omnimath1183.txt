The pattern suggests maximizing the size of \( s \) with the constraints that at most 3 points lie on each difference and sum line. Since the grid is \( 8 \times 8 \), the maximum number of points can be achieved by choosing all points with sum or difference lines intersecting at most 3 points, often around the middle diagonals. The largest such set is on the main and near diagonals, totaling 16 points without exceeding the constraints.

Therefore, the maximal \( n \) is:

<<<16>>>
