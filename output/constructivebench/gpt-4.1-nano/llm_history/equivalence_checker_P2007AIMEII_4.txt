Ground Truth Answer: 450
Proposed Answer: 300
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is setting up a system of equations with variables w₁ and w₂.
2. From the first set of equations (100 * w₁ = 300 ∧ 100 * w₂ = 200), we can solve:
   - w₁ = 300/100 = 3
   - w₂ = 200/100 = 2
3. The second set of equations (2 * 60 * w₁ = 240 ∧ 2 * 60 * w₂ = 300) confirms:
   - For w₁: 120 * 3 = 360 ≠ 240 (contradiction)
   - For w₂: 120 * 2 = 240 ≠ 300 (contradiction)
4. The third equation (3 * 50 * w₂ = answer) would give:
   - 150 * 2 = 300 (proposed answer)
   - But ground truth says 450

However, there's clearly a contradiction in the problem statement itself (the equations can't all be satisfied simultaneously). The proposed answer correctly calculates 3*50*2=300, but the ground truth claims 450, which would require w₂=3 (but w₂=2 from first equation).

Given the contradictions in the problem, but based on the given equations and values, the proposed answer is mathematically correct while the ground truth isn't.
