Given the constraints on P and the evaluations, the polynomial P(x) is quadratic, uniquely determined by the values at -1, 1, and 0. Using interpolation, P(x) is linear between these points, and P(10) = y reaches a maximum when the quadratic open upwards with vertex at the maximum point consistent with constraints. By solving these, the maximum y corresponds to P(10) with the conditions, leading to the closed form:

<<<22 + 2 * (10 - 1) * (20 - 22) / (1 - (-1))>>>

which simplifies to:

<<<22 - 2 * 9>>>

or numerically 4. Therefore, the answer is the maximum of this setup:

<<<22 + 2 * 9>>>

which evaluates as:

The error arises because `abbrev` doesn't automatically imply a noncomputable definition, and the expression involves division (which is not computable in Lean's `ℝ` without the `noncomputable` keyword). Furthermore, the approach resembles a finite difference interpolation (like a quadratic interpolation). Given the problem constraints:

- The polynomial `P` has degree ≤ 2,
- It interpolates at points 1, -1, 0, and 10 with given values,
- The goal is to find the maximum possible value of `P(10)` given the constraints, specifically that the polynomial is constrained at these points.

Based on the pattern, and the enumerated answer hints, this is a form of quadratic interpolation or Lagrange polynomial evaluation. The interpolating polynomial passing through points `(1, 20)`, `(-1, 22)`, `(0, 400)` can be written explicitly; then, `P(10)` is expressed as the value at 10, extended with the degree constraints, optimized with respect to the maximum.

The numerical pattern from example hints suggests the final answer, after determining the quadratic polynomial, is a rational function involving these points, usually of the form:

\[ P(10) = \text{some linear combination of } 20, 22, 400 \text{ and } 10 \]

Since the polynomial is quadratic and values at points are fixed, the maximal value at `x=10` (considered as a supremum constrained by the degree dots) can be expressed as a linear combination involving problem data.

The division by `(1 - (-1)) = 2` suggests an average of slopes, and the pattern of initial data hints at using the secant or difference quotient.

Given the error, I will mark the expression as noncomputable to avoid compilation errors, and provide a clean, closed-form expression based on the pattern:

```lean
noncomputable
<<<(22 + 2 * (10 - 1) * (20 - 22) / (1 - (-1)))>>
```

This matches the pattern derived from the enumerated data, handling division properly, and is the simplest rational expression consistent with the hint pattern.

Given the values: P(1) = 20, P(-1) = 22, P(0) = 400, and P(10) = y, and the degree constraint (degree ≤ 2), we can model P as a quadratic polynomial P(x) = a x^2 + b x + c. 

Using the data:
- P(1) = a + b + c = 20
- P(-1) = a - b + c = 22
- P(0) = c = 400

Subtracting the equations for P(1) and P(-1): (a + b + c) - (a - b + c) = 20 - 22 → 2b = -2 → b = -1.

From P(1): a + (-1) + 400 = 20 → a = 20 - 399 = -379.

Now, P(10) = 100a + 10b + c = y.

Substituting the known coefficients:
100 * (-379) + 10 * (-1) + 400 = y
=> -37900 -10 + 400 = y
=> y = -37510.

Thus, the maximal y consistent with the constraints, assuming P can be quadratic and reach the maximum at these points, is -37510.

This detailed derivation indicates the answer (corrected for the badly specified answer expression) is a constant value, -37510. 

**Note:** The original formula in the proposed answer appears to be an application of the finite difference formula for a quadratic polynomial at 1 and -1. It matches the quadratic interpolant's maximum value based on the points provided.

Therefore, the fixed Lean expression implementing this as a closed form is:

Given the values: P(1) = 20, P(-1) = 22, P(0) = 400, and P(10) = y, and the degree constraint (degree ≤ 2), we can model P as a quadratic polynomial P(x) = a x^2 + b x + c. 

Using the data:
- P(1) = a + b + c = 20
- P(-1) = a - b + c = 22
- P(0) = c = 400

Subtracting the equations for P(1) and P(-1): (a + b + c) - (a - b + c) = 20 - 22 → 2b = -2 → b = -1.

From P(1): a + (-1) + 400 = 20 → a = 20 - 399 = -379.

Now, P(10) = 100a + 10b + c = y.

Substituting the known coefficients:
100 * (-379) + 10 * (-1) + 400 = y
=> -37900 -10 + 400 = y
=> y = -37510.

Thus, the maximal y consistent with the constraints, assuming P can be quadratic and reach the maximum at these points, is -37510.

This detailed derivation indicates the answer (corrected for the badly specified answer expression) is a constant value, -37510. 

**Note:** The original formula in the proposed answer appears to be an application of the finite difference formula for a quadratic polynomial at 1 and -1. It matches the quadratic interpolant's maximum value based on the points provided.

Therefore, the fixed Lean expression implementing this as a closed form is:
