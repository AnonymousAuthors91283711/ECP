Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: (5/2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find the ratio m/b that satisfies the given equation (4m + 3b)*2 = 2m + 16b.

2. Let's solve the equation step by step:
   - Expand left side: 8m + 6b = 2m + 16b
   - Subtract 2m from both sides: 6m + 6b = 16b
   - Subtract 6b from both sides: 6m = 10b
   - Divide both sides by b (since b > 0): 6(m/b) = 10
   - Divide both sides by 6: m/b = 10/6 = 5/3

3. The ground truth answer is 2, but our calculation shows 5/3.
4. The proposed answer is 5/2, which is also incorrect.

Both answers are incorrect, but they are different incorrect answers. The correct answer should be 5/3.
