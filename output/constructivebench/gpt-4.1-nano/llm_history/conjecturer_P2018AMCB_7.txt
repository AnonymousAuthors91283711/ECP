noncomputable abbrev P2018AMCB_7_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2018AMCB_7 : 3 * Real.logb 7 23 = P2018AMCB_7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern of enumerated answers suggests the final expression involves a simple fraction with base 7 and exponent 23 scaled by constants to match the original expression (3 * log_b 7 23). Since 3 * log_b 7 23 equals log_b 7 23^3 and using properties of logs, this simplifies to log_b 7 7^3, which is 3. To match the pattern, the answer likely is 23, scaled appropriately. Relying on the pattern and properties of logarithms, the answer simplifies to the constant value 23. 

<<<23>>>
