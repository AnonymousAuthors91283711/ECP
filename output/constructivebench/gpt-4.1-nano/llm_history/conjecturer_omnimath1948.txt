Let's analyze the problem:

The set {S | ...} describes minimal S for which any amount m ≥ 1 can be achieved using the coins in a set that includes 100, with all coins positive, distinct, and the set's largest element S corresponds to the maximum amount that can be formed when coins are used optimally. Given the inclusion of 100 and the minimality condition, the limiting case occurs when only 100 is used for large amounts and smaller with other coins as needed. This suggests the minimal maximum amount S is closely related to the largest coin and the structure of sums.

Based on enumeration patterns, the minimal S should be just below 100, considering sums that exclude 100 and give all amounts from 1 up to a certain bound.

Thus, the best general candidate is:

<<<101>>>

which encompasses all amounts up to and including 100, considering the coin 100 alone, and minimal S satisfying the condition.

Final answer: 101
