The pattern indicates the answer is the sum of digits of n scaled by 6. Since the answer reflects the sum of digits of n in decimal form, the answer is always 6 times the sum of its digits. The answer simplifies to the value itself with respect to the sum of digits, and since the maximum n is bounded under 1000, the expression is consistent. 

Given the evidence, the straightforward closed-form answer is the constant 36, representing a typical significant sum of digits scaled by 6 for such n in the range.

<<<36>>>
