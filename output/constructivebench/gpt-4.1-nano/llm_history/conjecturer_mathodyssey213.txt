The pattern in enumerated answers suggests the answer resembles a form involving multiplication by an exponential function. Given the input parameters and the output, the structure appears to be theta-like or an exponential approximation based on the inputs standard in analysis. Since the proof suggests a direct proportionality with an exponential term involving the second parameter (0.09), the most natural closed form stands as a scaled exponential. Therefore, the conjectured answer is:

<<<fun x y => x * exp (y * 15)>>>
