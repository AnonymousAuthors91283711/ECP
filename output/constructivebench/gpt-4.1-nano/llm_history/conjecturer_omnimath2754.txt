The pattern suggests the minimal n where distinct a,b,c satisfy a+b+c+n=100. Choosing minimal a,b,c and ordering to minimize n, the minimal sum of a+b+c is 0+1+2=3, so n=97.

The error in your proposed answer arises because in Lean, you cannot directly assign an explanatory comment string to an abbrev. The line `abbrev omnimath2754_answer : ℕ :=` should be followed by an actual ℕ value, not a comment or string. The current input includes a comment rather than a number, which causes the parsing error.

To fix this, I will take the reasoning into account: minimal a, b, c are 0, 1, 2 respectively, summing to 3, making n = 100 - (a + b + c) = 97. This matches the pattern of choosing the smallest possible a, b, c that are distinct and satisfy a < b < c, then computing the corresponding n.

Given the constraints and the pattern, the solution should be a fixed value `97`. The precise logic is: minimal a = 0, minimal b = 1, minimal c = 2, their sum is 3, so n = 100 - 3 = 97.

**Final answer in Lean:**

<<<97>>>

**Explanation:**

- The minimal set of distinct a, b, c with a < b < c is (0,1,2).  
- Their sum is 3.  
- The relation is a + b + c + n = 100, so n = 100 - 3 = 97.  
- This choice minimizes n among all such triplets, thus the answer is 97.  

This conclusion aligns with the problem's goal to find the least n satisfying the conditions.
