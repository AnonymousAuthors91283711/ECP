  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | n.digits 10 ~ [2, 0, 1, 9] ∧ n % 7 = 0 ∧ (n.digits 10).length = 4} omnimath2150_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The answer should be the maximum 4-digit number ending with digits [2,0,1,9], divisible by 7, which is 2019 (the maximum under these digit constraints). 

Thus, the the number is 2019 itself, given the constraints and the pattern.
