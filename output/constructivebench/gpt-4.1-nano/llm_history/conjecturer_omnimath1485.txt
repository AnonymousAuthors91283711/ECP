The given equations are:
x - y = 4,
x^3 - y^3 = 28.

From the identity x^3 - y^3 = (x - y)(x^2 + xy + y^2),
substitute x - y = 4:
28 = 4 (x^2 + xy + y^2),
so x^2 + xy + y^2 = 7.

Knowing x - y = 4, then:
(x - y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = 16.

Adding the two equations:
(x^2 + xy + y^2) + (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) = 7 + 16,
which simplifies to:
2x^2 - xy + 2y^2 = 23.

But to find xy, use (x - y)^2:
16 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2,
and recall that x^2 + xy + y^2 = 7,
so:
adding these:
( x^2 + xy + y^2 ) + ( x^2 - 2xy + y^2 ) = 7 + 16 ⇒ 2x^2 - xy + 2y^2 = 23,
as before.

Just focusing on xy:
From x^2 + y^2 = (x - y)^2 + 2xy = 16 + 2xy,
also, x^2 + y^2 = 7 - xy.

Set equal:
7 - xy = 16 + 2xy ⇒ 7 - xy = 16 + 2xy,
which leads to:
7 - 16 = 3xy,
so -9 = 3xy,
then xy = -3.

Thus, the answer is: x * y = -3.
