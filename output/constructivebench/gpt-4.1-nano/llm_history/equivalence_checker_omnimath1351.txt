Ground Truth Answer: 2 + 2 * Real.sqrt 2 + 2 * Real.sqrt 3
Proposed Answer: (8) * (sqrt 2)
Let me analyze this carefully.

1. First, let's find the roots of the polynomial P(X) = X^4 - 4X^3 - 4X^2 + 16X - 8.

2. The ground truth answer suggests there are roots at:
   - ±√2 (absolute value √2)
   - 1±√3 (absolute values |1+√3| and |1-√3|)

3. Calculating the sum of absolute values:
   √2 + √2 + (1+√3) + (√3-1) = 2√2 + 2√3

4. The ground truth answer is 2 + 2√2 + 2√3, which doesn't match our calculation.

5. The proposed answer is 8√2, which is clearly different from both our calculation and the ground truth.

6. However, the ground truth answer itself seems incorrect based on the polynomial's roots. The correct sum should be 2√2 + 2√3.

Since neither the proposed answer nor the ground truth matches what appears to be the correct solution, but they're both different from each other:

<<<False>>>
