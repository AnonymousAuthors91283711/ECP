Ground Truth Answer: fun n => ∃ k, n.divisors.card = 2^k
Proposed Answer: fun n => ∃ m : ℕ, n = 2 ^ m
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer states that the number of divisors of n must be a power of 2 (∃ k, n.divisors.card = 2^k).

The proposed answer states that n itself must be a power of 2 (∃ m : ℕ, n = 2^m).

These are not equivalent because:
1. Numbers like 6 have divisors {1,2,3,6} - count is 4 (a power of 2) but 6 is not a power of 2
2. Numbers like 8 (2^3) satisfy both conditions
3. Numbers like 9 (3^2) satisfy neither condition

The proposed answer is strictly stronger than the ground truth answer - all powers of 2 satisfy the ground truth condition, but not all numbers satisfying the ground truth condition are powers of 2.
