theorem P2015AMCA_17 :
  (Fintype.card {f : Fin 8 → Bool | ∀ i : Fin 8, ¬(f i ∧ f (i + 1))}) / (Fintype.card (Fin 8 → Bool)) = P2015AMCA_17_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The problem counts functions from Fin 8 to Bool where no adjacent pair are both true, divided by total functions. The numerator counts sequences of length 8 with no two consecutive true entries, which aligns with Fibonacci sequence growth: the count is F_{10}. The total functions count is 2^8 = 256. So the ratio is F_{10} / 256 = 55/256.  
Final answer: <<<55/256>>>
