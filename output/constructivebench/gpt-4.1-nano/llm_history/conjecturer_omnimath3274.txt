(x y z : ℝ)
(hxyz : (x - y) / (z - y) = -10)
: (x - z) / (y - z) = omnimath3274_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests a related linear fractional transformation. Starting from (x - y)/(z - y) = -10, the goal is to find (x - z)/(y - z).

Given the symmetry and the pattern from the enumeration, the solution simplifies to a constant value independent of specific x, y, z values. Using algebraic transformations, the result simplifies to a constant ratio.

Thus, the answer should be 11. 

Final answer: <<<11>>>
