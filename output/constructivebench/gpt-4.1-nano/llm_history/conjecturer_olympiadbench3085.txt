Based on analysis, the constraints specify monic reciprocal polynomials with roots in ℤ, degree ≤ 7, content 1, and support including all degrees from 0 to 7. Such polynomials correspond to divisors of \(X^{8} - 1\). The number of monic divisors with these properties is 38. Hence, the answer is 

<<<38>>>
