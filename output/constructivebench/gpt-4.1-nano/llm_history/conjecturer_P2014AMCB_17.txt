Since the problem involves an inequality of quadratic equations and a sum of bounds, analyzing the quadratic x^2 = 14 + m(x - 20), the parameters m are constrained by the intervals where solutions exist. The key is that the solutions depend on m relative to a specific quadratic discriminant condition, leading to a finite interval for m. The pattern suggests that the sum of the endpoints corresponds to a fixed value involving the roots, likely based on the constant terms and bounds in the inequality. Based on the pattern, the sum should be 26.
