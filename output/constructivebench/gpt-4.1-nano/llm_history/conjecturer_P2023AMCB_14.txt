The polynomial factors into roots r, s, t with r, s, t distinct. The roots must be the roots of the cubic polynomial, which factors as (X - r)(X - s)(X - t). The sum of roots is proportional to the coefficient of X², and product relates to the constant term.  
Since the constant term is 6, and roots are distinct integers, their possible triplets are permutations of (1, 2, 3) and their negatives, considering all sign combinations.  
The count of such triplets (with distinct roots) corresponds to permutations and sign variations fitting the polynomial.  
Final answer: <<<8>>>
