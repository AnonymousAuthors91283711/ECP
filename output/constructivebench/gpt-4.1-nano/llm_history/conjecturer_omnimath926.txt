The given condition simplifies using identities: \( 1 - \sin^4 x - \cos^2 x = \frac{1}{16} \). Recognizing \(\sin^4 x = (\sin^2 x)^2\) and \(\cos^2 x = 1 - \sin^2 x\), substitution yields a quadratic in \( \sin^2 x \), leading to solutions \( \sin^2 x = \frac{1}{4} \), so \( \sin x = \pm \frac{1}{2} \). The interval restricts \( x \) to quadrants where sine is positive or negative accordingly. Final answer set describes \( x \) with \( \sin x = \pm \frac{1}{2} \) within \( (-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}) \).

The core issue is that in Lean, you cannot define an abbreviation as a comment with explanatory text. Instead, you need to define it as an actual set expression involving explicit conditions that follow from the identities and solutions. 

Given the identities and the quadratic solution, the set of all \(x\) satisfying the original condition are the points where \(\sin x = \pm 1/2\). Within \((- \pi/2, \pi/2)\), the sine function is increasing and covers \((-1, 1)\), and for \(\sin x = 1/2\), the solution is \(x = \pi/6\). For \(\sin x = -1/2\), the solution is \(x = - \pi/6\). Since the interval is open and symmetric around 0, the solutions are exactly these points in the interval.

Thus, the answer set is exactly \(\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x = \pi/6 \vee x = -\pi/6\}\). 

In Lean, the proper syntax for such a set uses `Set` with a predicate:

```lean
<<
{ x | x = π/6 ∨ x = -π/6 }
>>
```

**Final Answer:**
<<<
{ x | x = π/6 ∨ x = -π/6 }

The current proposed answer `<< { x | x = π/6 ∨ x = -π/6 } >>` uses `<<` and `>>` which are not valid syntax in Lean for set definition. The Lean syntax for sets uses curly braces `{ ... }` directly with the membership condition, or set-builder notation with `Set`.

Given the enumeration, it seems the two solutions to the equation are x = π/6 and x = -π/6. The condition specifies that x must satisfy the inequalities and the equation.

Since the core of the answer involves exact points, the set should be those points `x` where `x = π/6` or `x = -π/6`, satisfying the given inequalities.

The answer should be a set of two elements `{ π/6, -π/6 }`.

To define this correctly as a set in Lean:

```lean
abbrev omnimath926_answer : Set ℝ := { x | x = π/6 ∨ x = -π/6 }
```

which is the proper syntax.

**Final fixed answer:**

<<<{ x | x = π/6 ∨ x = -π/6 }>>>

This set represents precisely the solutions, aligns with the enumerated hint, and uses correct syntax.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The primary errors stem from using the Unicode character 'π' instead of the Lean standard notation 'Real.pi'. Also, to make the answer set explicit, it's better to write it as a set of points explicitly, possibly using finite set notation. Given the enumerated solutions {x | x = π/6 ∨ x = -π/6}, the correct way to express these points in Lean is to use 'Real.pi / 6' and '– Real.pi / 6'. 

Since the known solutions are at ± π/6, the closed-form set can be expressed as a set containing exactly these two points. Also, to match the original problem's set, which is a subset of real numbers, we need to define a set with such points.

In the absence of orthogonal notation, a perfect option is:

- Use 'Real.pi / 6' and '- Real.pi / 6' instead of 'π/6' and '-π/6'.
- Construct the set explicitly in Lean using set notation, e.g., `{x | x = Real.pi / 6 ∨ x = -Real.pi / 6}`.

Final code for the answer set:

<<<{x | x = Real.pi / 6 ∨ x = -Real.pi / 6}>>>

This matches the enumerated solutions, adheres to Lean syntax, and avoids the 'unknown identifier' errors.
