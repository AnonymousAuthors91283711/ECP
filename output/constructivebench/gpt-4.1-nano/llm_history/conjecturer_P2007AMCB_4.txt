theorem P2007AMCB_4 : 
  ∃ (w b r : ℚ), w + b + r = 1 ∧ w / b = 16 / 3 ∧ b / r = 3 / 1 ∧ w = P2007AMCB_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Given the ratios w/b = 16/3 and b/r = 3/1, express w in terms of r. Solving for w yields w = (16/3) * b and b = 3 * r, so w = (16/3) * 3 * r = 16 * r. Sum w + b + r = 1 implies 16r + 3r + r = 20r = 1, so r = 1/20, b = 3/20, w = 16/20 = 4/5. The answer is w = 4/5. 

<<<(4/5)>>>
