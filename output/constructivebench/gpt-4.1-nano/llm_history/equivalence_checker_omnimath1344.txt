Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves trigonometric identities and algebraic manipulations with x, y and θ under certain constraints.

2. The key equations are:
   - sinθ/x = cosθ/y (h1)
   - A more complex trigonometric equation (h2)

3. From h1, we can derive that y/x = cotθ, which will be useful for simplifying the final expression x/y + y/x.

4. The ground truth answer is 4, while the proposed answer is 2.

5. Let's consider the expression x/y + y/x:
   - Using y/x = cotθ, this becomes tanθ + cotθ
   - tanθ + cotθ = sinθ/cosθ + cosθ/sinθ = (sin²θ + cos²θ)/(sinθcosθ) = 1/(sinθcosθ) = 2/sin(2θ)

6. The problem's h2 equation would then need to be used to find the value of 2/sin(2θ), which should lead to 4 (ground truth) rather than 2 (proposed answer).

The proposed answer of 2 is incorrect based on this analysis. The correct answer should be 4.
