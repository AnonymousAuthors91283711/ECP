The problem involves scores summing to 132 with each score either odd or even, and total counts summing to 12, with a specific property encapsulated by P2015AMCA_13_answer. Based on the pattern in enumerated answers, the key implication is that the unique score satisfying the property is when n = 4, corresponding to the maximum possible value consistent with the sum constraints, with the property holding exclusively there. Therefore, the closed-form expression relates to the singleton property at n=4.

. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: Fin 5 → Prop
The errors are because the comment text was accidentally embedded directly into the abbrev definition, which is not valid in Lean syntax. The abbrev definition should contain only an expression of type Fin 5 → Prop, specifically the singleton property at n=4, suggesting that the answer is true only for n = 4. Based on the pattern and reasoning, the answer is simply that P2015AMCA_13_answer n holds iff n = 4. The best closed-form answer fitting the pattern and satisfying the conjecture is:

<<<fun n : Fin 5 => n = 4>>>

This correctly denotes that the property holds precisely at n = 4, and nowhere else.
