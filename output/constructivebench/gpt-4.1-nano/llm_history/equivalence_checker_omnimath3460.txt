Ground Truth Answer: fun pairs => ∃ (p : ℚ × ℚ), p ∈ pairs ∧ (73 + 82 + 85 + p.1 + p.2) / 5 < 80
Proposed Answer: λ pairs => ∃ p ∈ pairs, p.1 + p.2 < 160
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer states that there exists a pair p in pairs such that (73 + 82 + 85 + p.1 + p.2)/5 < 80.

The proposed answer states that there exists a pair p in pairs such that p.1 + p.2 < 160.

Let's simplify the ground truth condition:
(73 + 82 + 85 + p.1 + p.2)/5 < 80
=> (240 + p.1 + p.2)/5 < 80
=> 240 + p.1 + p.2 < 400
=> p.1 + p.2 < 160

This shows that the two conditions are mathematically equivalent. The proposed answer is just a simplified form of the ground truth answer.
