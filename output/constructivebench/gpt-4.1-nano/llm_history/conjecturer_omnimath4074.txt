The pattern suggests the expression involves ratios of powers of the clique sizes, commonly simplified to (combinatorial bounds). From the enumerations showing high coefficients, the final minimal ratio appears to be \(\frac{81}{64}\).

<<<(81/64 : ℚ)>>>

This rational offers the minimal constant satisfying the inequality universally.
