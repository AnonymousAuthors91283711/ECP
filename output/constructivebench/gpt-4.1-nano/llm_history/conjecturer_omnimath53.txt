The problem asks for the minimal n such that any sequence of subsets over X with |X|=100 contains three indices forming a chain or a reversed chain of subsets. With 100 elements, the minimal n ensuring this by the Erdős–Szekeres-type reasoning is 101, as at least one chain or anti-chain must exist in a set of size 101. 

<<<101>>>
