The recurrence \( F(n+2) = \frac{5}{2} F(n+1) - F(n) \) suggests a solution of the form \( r^n \). The characteristic equation is \( r^2 - \frac{5}{2} r + 1 = 0 \), which solves to roots \( r = 1, \frac{1}{2} \). So, general solution: \( F(n) = A \cdot 1^n + B \cdot (1/2)^n \). Using initial conditions \( F(0) = 0 \), \( F(1)= 3/2 \), we find \( B = 3 \), \( A= -1 \). When substituted, \( F(n) = -1 + 3 \cdot (1/2)^n \). The sum becomes geometric: \(\sum 1/F(2^n) = \sum 1/(-1 + 3/2^{n})\). Simplifies to \( \sum 2^{n} / (2^{n} - 2) \). Final form: \( \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{2^{n}}{2^{n} - 2} \). Recognizing it telescopes, the sum converges to 2.
