Ground Truth Answer: {⟨11, 1⟩, ⟨49, 1⟩} ∪ {⟨7 * t ^ 2, 7 * t⟩ | t : ℤ}
Proposed Answer: { ⟨x, y⟩ : ℤ × ℤ | x > 0 ∧ y > 0 ∧ (x = 1 ∨ 7 ∣ x) ∧ (x^2 * y + x + y) % (x * y^2 + y + 7) = 0 }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all positive integer pairs (x,y) where x²y + x + y is divisible by xy² + y + 7.

2. Ground Truth Answer:
   - Explicit solutions: (11,1) and (49,1)
   - Parametric family: (7t², 7t) for t ∈ ℤ

3. Proposed Answer:
   - All positive pairs (x,y) where either x=1 or x is divisible by 7, and satisfying the divisibility condition.

Comparison:
- The proposed answer includes all pairs where x=1 or 7 divides x, but doesn't specify the exact solutions.
- The ground truth gives specific solutions and a parametric family (all of which satisfy x divisible by 7 except (11,1)).
- The proposed answer is more general but includes some cases that might not satisfy the original equation (like x=1 with arbitrary y).
- The ground truth is more precise and complete.

The answers are not equivalent because:
1. The proposed answer includes x=1 cases not in the ground truth
2. The proposed answer doesn't capture the specific (11,1) solution
3. The proposed answer doesn't specify the parametric form for the 7|x cases
