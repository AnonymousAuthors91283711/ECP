  10^(x - y) = omnimath2321_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the symmetry of the equations and the logs involved, the solution suggests that x and y are equal and satisfy the relation involving powers of 10.

Final answer in Lean:
<<<1>>>

This is consistent with the equality in the logarithms leading to x = y, and thus 10^(x - y) = 1.
