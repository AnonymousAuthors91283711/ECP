The pattern suggests combining bounds of 1 and 2 with the expression \(3/a + b\). As \(a \in [1,2]\), and \(b \in [a,2]\), the minimum of \(x=3/a + b\) occurs at \(a=2, b=a=1\), giving \(3/2 + 1 = 2.5\). The maximum at \(a=1, b=2\), giving \(3/1 + 2 = 5\). The sum of infimum and supremum should then be \(2.5 + 5 = 7.5\). So, the answer is the number 7.5.

<<<(7.5)>>>
