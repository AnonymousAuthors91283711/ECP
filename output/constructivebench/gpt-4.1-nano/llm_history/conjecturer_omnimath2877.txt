abbrev omnimath2877_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2877
: (Real.sqrt (16 * Real.sqrt 16) = omnimath2877_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the expression \( \sqrt{16 \times \sqrt{16}} \), note that \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \), so the inside becomes \( 16 \times 4 = 64 \). Taking the square root yields \( \sqrt{64} = 8 \). 

The pattern and the enumerations suggest the simplified exact answer is 8.

<<<8>>>
