theorem P2021AMCA_3 :
  ∃ (a b : ℕ), a + b = 17402 ∧ 10 ∣ a ∧ b = a / 10 ∧ a - b = P2021AMCA_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern and the problem constraints, the difference `a - b` simplifies to a multiple influenced by division and modulo properties with 10. The enumerated answer suggests that the difference in specific solutions aligns with a pattern involving the division and subtraction properties concerning 10. 

Considering the pattern and the typical structure of such problems, the final difference `a - b` consolidates into a multiple of 17402 related to the division by 10.
