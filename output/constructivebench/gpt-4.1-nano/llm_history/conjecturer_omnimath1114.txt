  Fintype.card {s : Fin 36 → Fin 10 | let sum := (univ.sum s) % 10; sum ∉ Set.range s} = omnimath1114_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The condition specifies functions s where the sum mod 10 of 36 elements, each from Fin 10, is not in the range of s. Typically, the total sum mod 10 ranges over all residues 0..9. Since the sums are uniformly distributed and s’s range is from 0..9, sums not in the range are the residues excluding the sum of all elements in s. The total count reduces to choosing functions avoiding a specific sum residue, leading to a combinatorial count involving powers of 10 and adjustments for the sum restrictions. The pattern suggests the final count involves 10^35 minus some correction relating to the sum. 
Hence, the answer is 10^35 – 10^34. 

<<<(10 : ℕ) ^ 35 - (10 : ℕ) ^ 34>>>
