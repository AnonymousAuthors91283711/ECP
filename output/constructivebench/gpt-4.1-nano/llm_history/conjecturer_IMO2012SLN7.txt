theorem IMO2012SLN7 (n : ℕ) :
  (∃ (a : ℕ → ℕ), (∑ i in Finset.range n, (1 / 2 ^ (a i)) = 1 ∧ ∑ i in Finset.range n, ((i + 1) / 3 ^ (a i)) = 1)) ↔ n ∈ IMO2012SLN7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests the answer set consists of all integers \( n \) that can be partitioned with exponents \( a(i) \) satisfying the sum conditions. This corresponds to \( n = 2 \), matching the specific sums with powers of 2 and 3. Since the sums converge neatly at \( n=2 \), the exhaustive pattern indicates the answer set is just \( \{2\} \).
