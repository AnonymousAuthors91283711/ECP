The polynomial factors correspond to quadratic roots r₁ and r₂ satisfying these conditions. For the quadratic (X - C r₁)(X - C r₂) = X^2 + C k X + C 36, the sum and product of roots are r₁ + r₂ = -k and r₁ r₂ = 36. Since r₁ ≠ r₂, k ∈ ℤ varies over the integer sums of two distinct divisors of 36 with appropriate signs. The divisors of 36 are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±9, ±12, ±18, ±36. For each, the possible pairs give different sums; counting all pairs yields 16 solutions.

The errors in your Lean code are caused by the improper use of natural language sentences directly in an abbrev declaration, leading to syntax errors. To fix this, the answer should be a closed-form natural number expression, reflecting the total number of solutions. From the problem's description and enumeration, the counting involves the pairs of divisors of 36 with distinct roots, i.e., pairs (r₁, r₂) with r₁ ≠ r₂, satisfying r₁r₂ = 36, and counting the sum frameworks.

Since for each divisor pair (d, 36/d), their possible signs give four combinations: (+d, +36/d), (+d, –36/d), (–d, +36/d), (–d, –36/d). But only those with r₁ ≠ r₂ are counted, which excludes the case where r₁ = r₂; the pair (6,6) would correspond to r₁ = r₂, which is excluded.

Divisors of 36 are: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±9, ±12, ±18, ±36.

Counting all pairs of divisors with product 36 (and excluding duplicates and pairs with identical roots), the total number of solutions is 16, as per the enumeration.

The final answer, representing this total count, is 16.
