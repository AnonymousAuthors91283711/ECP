The sum of the floors reduces as floors of dividing by 20 and 30. The sum for t=300: ⌊300/20⌋ + ⌊300/30⌋ = 15 + 10 = 25; general form: ⌊t/20⌋ + ⌊t/30⌋. The general sum for t: ⌊t / 20⌋ + ⌊t / 30⌋.

The error arises because `abbrev P2012AMCA_2_answer` is declared as an ℕ (natural number), but the right-hand side is a lambda function `(t : ℕ) => ...`, which is a function type, not an ℕ. 

Based on the current goal, the key point is to evaluate the function at `t = 300`. The problem reduces to computing `⌊300/20⌋ + ⌊300/30⌋`, i.e., the sum of the integer divisions of 300 by 20 and 30 respectively.

Calculating:
- `⌊300/20⌋ = 15`
- `⌊300/30⌋ = 10`
So, the sum is `15 + 10 = 25`.

Thus, the answer should be this value—an ℕ (natural number). 

To fix the code, define `P2012AMCA_2_answer` as the constant `25`.

Final fix:

<<<25>>>

This is a proper total answer matching the expected type ℕ and evaluated at the specified point.
