noncomputable abbrev P2009AMCA_3_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2009AMCA_3 :
  (1 / 4 + (1 / 3) * ((3 / 4) - 1 / 4) = P2009AMCA_3_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the calculation, the expression simplifies to (1/4) + (1/3) * (1/2), which equals 1/4 + 1/6 = (3/12)+(2/12) = 5/12. Therefore, the answer is 5/12 in simplified form. 

<<<5 / 12>>>
