theorem olympiadbench2333 (p : ℝ) (hp : 0 ≤ p ∧ p ≤ 1) :
    ∃ (a b c d : ℤ), d ≠ 0 ∧ olympiadbench2333_answer p = (a * p^2 + b * p + c) / d := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun p => (1 - p^2) / 3
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℝ => (p * (1 - p)) / 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function of p (where 0 ≤ p ≤ 1) that can be expressed as a quadratic polynomial in p divided by a non-zero integer.

2. The ground truth answer is (1 - p²)/3, which is indeed of the required form with:
   a = -1, b = 0, c = 1, d = 3

3. The proposed answer is (p(1 - p))/1, which is equivalent to p - p². This is of the required form with:
   a = -1, b = 1, c = 0, d = 1

4. The two functions are clearly different:
   - Ground truth: (1 - p²)/3
   - Proposed: p - p²

5. For example at p = 0.5:
   - Ground truth: (1 - 0.25)/3 = 0.25
   - Proposed: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25
   They happen to be equal at this point, but at p = 0:
   - Ground truth: 1/3 ≈ 0.333
   - Proposed: 0
   They are different.
