Ground Truth Answer: fun T => 362
Proposed Answer: fun T : ℚ => (T^2 + 20*T + 203)/2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a cubic polynomial equation in terms of X with roots a, b, c and asks us to express a² + b² + c² in terms of T.

2. From Vieta's formulas, we know:
   - a + b + c = 20
   - ab + ac + bc = 19
   - abc = -T

3. The expression a² + b² + c² can be written as (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + ac + bc) = 20² - 2*19 = 400 - 38 = 362.

4. The ground truth answer correctly gives this constant value of 362, which doesn't depend on T.

5. The proposed answer gives a function of T, which contradicts the fact that a² + b² + c² is constant (362) regardless of T's value.

The proposed answer is incorrect because it makes the expression depend on T when it should be constant.
