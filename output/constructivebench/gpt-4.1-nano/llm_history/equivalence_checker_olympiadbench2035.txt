Ground Truth Answer: 8 / (7 ^ (1/3))
Proposed Answer: 4 * (25/32)^(1/3)
Let's analyze the proposed answer and compare it to the ground truth answer.

1. Ground truth: 8 / (7^(1/3)) ≈ 4.381 (when calculated numerically)
2. Proposed answer: 4 * (25/32)^(1/3) ≈ 4 * 0.85498 ≈ 3.4199

The numerical values are significantly different (4.381 vs 3.4199), so they cannot be equivalent expressions.

Furthermore, let's consider the problem's structure:
- The maximum occurs when one variable is 100 and others are 0 (due to the reciprocal-like structure of the terms)
- For example, when a=100 and b=c=d=0, we get (100/7)^(1/3) ≈ 2.448
- When two variables are 50 and others are 0, we get 2*(50/7)^(1/3) ≈ 3.876
- The ground truth 8/7^(1/3) ≈ 4.381 is indeed larger than these cases, making it plausible as the maximum
- The proposed answer gives a lower value than even some suboptimal cases
