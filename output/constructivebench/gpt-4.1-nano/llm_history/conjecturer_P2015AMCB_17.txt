The expression involves ratios of binomial coefficients with powers of 1/4 and 3/4. Since the equality involves choosing n over 2 and 3, the critical point likely relates to when these ratios are minimized or equal. Solving the algebraic condition yields n = 4 as the least such integer satisfying the equality.  
The closed-form answer based on the pattern and minimal n is:  
<<<4>>>
