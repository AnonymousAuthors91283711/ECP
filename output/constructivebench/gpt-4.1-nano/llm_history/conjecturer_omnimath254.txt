Because the set compares the counts of k (1 ≤ k < 2012) where (a*k) mod 2012 > (b*k) mod 2012 for two distinct a, b, the structure is symmetric around half the interval. For the minimal s, choosing consecutive integers a, a+1 near the middle minimizes the count difference, approximately half the interval. The minimal s is thus approximately (2012 - 2) / 2 = 1005.
