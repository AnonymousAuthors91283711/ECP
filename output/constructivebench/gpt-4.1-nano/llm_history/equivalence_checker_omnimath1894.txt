theorem omnimath1894 :

Ground Truth Answer: {fun x : ℝ => 0, fun x : ℝ => x ^ 2}
Proposed Answer: { f | ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ x : ℝ, f x = c * x ^ 2 }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is a functional equation asking for all functions f: ℝ → ℝ that satisfy:
   f(x² + f(y)) = f(f(x)) + f(y²) + 2f(xy) for all x,y ∈ ℝ

2. Ground Truth Answer gives two specific solutions: the zero function and the square function.

3. Proposed Answer claims all solutions are quadratic functions of the form f(x) = c·x².

Analysis:
- The zero function (c=0) and identity quadratic (c=1) are indeed solutions.
- However, we need to check if other quadratic functions satisfy the equation.
- For f(x) = c·x², substitute into the original equation:
  Left side: c(x² + c·y²)²
  Right side: c(c·x²)² + c(y²)² + 2c(xy)² = c³x⁴ + c·y⁴ + 2c·x²y²
- These are only equal for all x,y when c=0 or c=1 (other coefficients don't satisfy the identity).

The proposed answer claims all quadratic functions work, but only c=0 and c=1 work. Therefore, the proposed answer is too broad.
