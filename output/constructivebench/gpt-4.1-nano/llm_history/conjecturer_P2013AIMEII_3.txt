theorem P2013AIMEII_3 :
  let totalTime := ∑ k in Finset.range 119, 10 * (k + 1)
  let halfTime := totalTime / 2
  let heightAtHalfTime := 119 - (Finset.card {k ∈ Finset.range 119 | ∑ i in Finset.range k, 10 * (i + 1) ≤ halfTime})
  10 * heightAtHalfTime = P2013AIMEII_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests that at half of the total time, the height is proportional to the midpoint index. The total time sums to 10 * (1 + 2 + ... + 119) = 10 * (119 * 120 / 2) = 10 * 7140 = 71400. Half of total time is 35700. Solving 10 * sum_{i=1}^k i ≤ 35700 yields k = 119 - 30 = 89. The height at this k is 119 - 89 = 30. Since 10 * heightAtHalfTime = 10 * 30 = 300, the answer is 300.
