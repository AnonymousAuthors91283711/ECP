The conditions imply that both a+b are divisible by 77 and 79, and 0 < a, 0 < b. Since 77 and 79 are coprime, the smallest positive a + b satisfying both divisibility constraints occurs when a and b are multiples of their least common multiple's factors. The fundamental solution is when a = 77k, b = 79k, the minimal positive case is k=1, so their sum is 77 + 79 = 156. Hence, the minimal sum is 156.

<<<156>>>
