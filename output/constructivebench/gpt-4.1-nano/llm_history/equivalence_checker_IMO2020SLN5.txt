abbrev IMO2020SLN5_answer : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem IMO2020SLN5 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∃ n, f n ≠ 0) ∧
  (∀ x y, f (x * y) = f x + f y) ∧
  (Set.Infinite {n : ℕ | ∀ k < n, f k = f (n - k)}) ↔
  ∃ p c, Prime p ∧ c ≠ 0 ∧ f = IMO2020SLN5_answer p c := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun p c n => c * (padicValNat p n)
Proposed Answer: fun p c => if c ≠ 0 then p * c else 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a function f : ℕ → ℕ that satisfies three conditions:
   - f is not identically zero
   - f is completely multiplicative (f(x*y) = f(x) + f(y))
   - There are infinitely many n where f(k) = f(n-k) for all k < n

2. The ground truth answer is the p-adic valuation function (counting multiplicity of prime p in n's factorization) scaled by c.

3. The proposed answer is a constant function (always returning p*c when c≠0) which doesn't depend on n.

The proposed answer fails because:
- It doesn't satisfy the multiplicative property (f(x*y) ≠ f(x)+f(y))
- It's a constant function, which would only satisfy the third condition if f is identically zero (but the first condition prohibits this)
- It doesn't actually use its input n in the computation
