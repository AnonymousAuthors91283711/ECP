theorem olympiadbench1645 (b c d : ℤ) :
    (∃ (n : ℤ), n^3 + b * n^2 + c * n + d = 0) →
    (fun n => n^3 + b * n^2 + c * n + d) 2015 * (fun n => n^3 + b * n^2 + c * n + d) 2016 ∈ olympiadbench1645_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℤ
The polynomial's roots are integers if the product at 2015 and 2016 is zero, which occurs if either root matches these values. Therefore, the answer set contains all such integers, i.e., 0 and the roots 2015, 2016.
