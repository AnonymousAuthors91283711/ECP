Ground Truth Answer: 109
Proposed Answer: 111
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. From the given conditions:
   - p = q - 1
   - q = r - 1 ⇒ r = q + 1
   - r = s - 1 ⇒ s = r + 1 = q + 2

2. From p + s = 109:
   (q - 1) + (q + 2) = 109
   2q + 1 = 109
   2q = 108
   q = 54

3. Then r = q + 1 = 55
4. Therefore q + r = 54 + 55 = 109

The ground truth answer (109) matches our calculation, while the proposed answer (111) does not.
