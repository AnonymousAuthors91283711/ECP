The expression involves factors of 3 and powers of 4 and 3, with a factorial ratio simplified to 3^r. Since the highest power of 3 dividing the entire factorial-related expression is key, and the factorial ratio reduces to a power of 3, the greatest r corresponds to the exponent of 3 in the factorization.

By analyzing the factorial division and powers, the dominant factorization yields:

<<<(4 * 3)^4 - 1>>>
