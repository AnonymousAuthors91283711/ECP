Given that f n is a quadratic polynomial with roots depending on n, and the condition that for some n, f n has no real roots (meaning its discriminant is negative), the conclusion is that such n must satisfy |2 n - 1|^2 < 4(n^2 - 22), which simplifies to no real solutions, thus n must be outside this discriminant range. Since the roots are complex only when the discriminant is negative, for f n to never be zero for any real x, n must satisfy n^2 < 22, i.e., n < √22. The only integer satisfying this is n=1, but the discriminant check indicates a threshold at n=5 as the boundary for real roots. Therefore, the only such n with no real roots, i.e., no zeros, is n=5.
