    IsLeast
    {((x * y - 1) ^ 2 + (x + y) ^ 2) | (x : ℝ) (y : ℝ)}
    P2021AMCA_7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern in the enumerated answers suggests the minimal value occurs when \(x = y\). Substituting \(x = y = t\), the expression becomes \(2(t^2 - 1)^2\). Minimizing \( (t^2 - 1)^2 \) yields \(0\) at \(t = \pm 1\). Therefore, the minimal value is \(0\).
