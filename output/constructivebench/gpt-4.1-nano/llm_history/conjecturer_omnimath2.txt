Let's analyze the pattern from enumerated answers and the problem structure: the expression involves the number of edges in a complete directed graph (tournament) with constraints on coloring. The minimal such k for n vertices appears to relate to 2^{n-1}.

My conjecture based on similar combinatorial optimization problems is:

<<<fun n => 2^(n - 1)>>>
