  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∀ (f : Fin n → Fin 10 → Bool), 
    ∃ (s : Finset (Fin n)) (i j : Fin 10),

Given the problem's pattern, the minimal n where for any function f, there's a set s of size 57 satisfying the conditions, the answer is the smallest such n. Since enumeration suggests n=57 achieves the set size, and increasing n likely surpasses minimality, the closed form is 57.
