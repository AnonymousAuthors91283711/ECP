The problem involves two digits swapped to form a number, multiplied by some number b to get 161. Since 161 factors as 1×161 or 7×23, and 10 ≤ a < 100 with swapped digits, plausible a must be 7x or 23x, but only single-digit multiplied by 10 plus the other digit forms such numbers. Given the constraints, a = 76 (since 76 swapped is 67) satisfies 67 * 2 = 134, not 161; so the combination must match 7 or 23. Testing a candidate yields a = 76, which with b=2 gives 152, close but not 161. However, with a = 71, swapped is 17, and 17×b=161 implies b=9. Since a=71, 10 ≤ a < 100, and 71×9=639, not 161. Next, analyze swapped digit a=61, swapped is 16, 16×b=161, no integer b. a=23, swapped 32, 32×b=161, b≈5.03. a=32 swapped is 23, 23×7=161, so a=23, b=7. 

Thus, the answer is 23×7=161. Final answer:

<<<23*7>>>
