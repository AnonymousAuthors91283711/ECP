noncomputable abbrev mathodyssey11_answer : ℕ → ℚ := sorry
theorem mathodyssey11 (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) :
  IsLeast {q : ℚ | ∃ (m : ℕ), 0 < m ∧ q = mathodyssey11_answer m} 13 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℚ
Given the pattern and the minimal element being 13 when n > 0, the formula likely yields a constant value 13 for all positive n. Therefore, the closed-form expression would just be the constant 13. 

<<<fun n : ℕ => 13>>>
