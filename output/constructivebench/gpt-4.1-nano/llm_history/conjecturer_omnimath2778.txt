theorem omnimath2778 : 
  {k : ℝ | ∃! x, x^2 + 2*k*x + 7*k - 10 = 0} = {5, 2} ∧ 
  (5 : ℝ) + 2 = omnimath2778_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The only values of k satisfying the given quadratic's unique solution are k = 2, 5. Since the answer involves 5 + 2, the explicit constant sum is 7. Therefore, the closed-form answer is 7.
