    IsLeast P omnimath4076_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the pattern of the enumerated answers and the bounding structure, the minimal value of M ensuring the inequality holds generally is 0, since the expression can be made arbitrarily small or vanish. Thus, the lower bound (answer) is 0 in ℝ.

<<<0>>>

This suggests the answer is the minimal M satisfying the inequality is 0, and the answer takes the form of a real number, \(\rr{0}\).
