The pattern suggests the sum involves the floor of division by 3 across the interval 1 to m−1. The sum of these floors resembles a known sum over the quotient when dividing by 3. 

In closed form, sum_{k=1}^{m−1} ⌊k/3⌋ simplifies to ⌊(m−1)^2 / 6⌋, representing the total of these floor values. 

Therefore, the answer function approximates k/3 summed over k, giving a quadratic form. 

Final answer in Lean:
<<<fun m : ℝ => ⌊(m - 1)^2 / 6⌋>>>
