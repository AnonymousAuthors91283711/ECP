  IsLeast {p : ℕ | p.Prime ∧ ∃ n, 0 < n ∧ p^2 ∣ n^4 + 1} 17 ∧
  IsLeast {m : ℕ | 0 < m ∧ 17^2 ∣ m^4 + 1} P2024AIMEI_13_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the focus is on prime \( p \) with properties involving divisibility conditions on \( p^2 \). The minimal prime satisfying the condition likely involves the smallest prime where \( p^2 \mid n^4 + 1 \) for some \( n \). Since 17 is given explicitly, and 17^2 divides some \( n^4 + 1 \), the minimal such prime appears to be 17 itself.

Answer:
<<<17>>>
