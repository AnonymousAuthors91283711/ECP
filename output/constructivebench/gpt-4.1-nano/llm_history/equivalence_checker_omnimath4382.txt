Ground Truth Answer: {n | 1 < n}
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 2 ≤ n
<<<True>>>
The ground truth answer {n | 1 < n} and the proposed answer fun n : ℕ => 2 ≤ n are equivalent. Both expressions define the set of natural numbers greater than 1. In Lean, 1 < n and 2 ≤ n are equivalent conditions for natural numbers n. The first uses set notation while the second uses a function definition, but they represent the same mathematical concept.
