Given the maximum expression involves pairs (a + b), (b + c), (c + d), (d + e), the minimal maximum occurs when these are balanced, which implies each sum ≈ 2010/4 ≈ 502 or 503. Distributing the total sum equally with five positive integers yields minimal maximum at 504 when one value slightly exceeds 502. 

<<<504>>>
