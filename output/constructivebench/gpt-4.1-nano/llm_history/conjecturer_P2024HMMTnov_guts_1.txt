The pattern suggests the minimal angular segment on the circle occurs when the difference between θ₁ and θ₂ approaches π, symmetric cases where Δθ = π. This results in the smallest piece being π, and thus the answer is π / (2*π) = 1/2.

The core idea is to identify the minimal segment on a circle determined by two angles θ₁ and θ₂, considering their difference Δθ. The smallest arc segment between two points on a circle occurs when the two points are oppositely placed, i.e., when Δθ approaches π. In this case, the smallest arc length will be π, and since the total circle circumference or the total angle measure is 2π, the ratio of the smallest segment to the entire circle is π / (2π) = 1/2. Errors in the original snippet are related to extraneous descriptive text and ordering in the code, which should be cleaned to fit Lean syntax. The calculation is a fixed value, 1/2, which is independent of n or any variable, due to the symmetry and minimality condition.  

Final answer:  
<<<1/2>>>
