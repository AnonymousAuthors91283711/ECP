theorem P2020AMCA_4 : 
  Finset.card (Finset.filter (fun n => 1000 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 9999 ∧ (∀ d ∈ digits 10 n, Even d) ∧ 5 ∣ n) (Finset.Icc 1000 9999)) = P2020AMCA_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem asks for the count of four-digit numbers between 1000 and 9999 where all digits are even and the number is divisible by 5. Since the last digit must be even and divisible by 5, it must be 0, as it is the only even digit divisible by 5. The first digit can be any of {2, 4, 6, 8} to ensure four-digit numbers, and the middle two digits can be any even digit {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}. Therefore, total valid numbers: 4 (first digit) × 5 (second digit) × 5 (third digit) × 1 (last digit = 0). 

Final answer:
<<<4 * 5 * 5 * 1>>>
