Ground Truth Answer: 24
Proposed Answer: 9 + 15
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us:
   - r = b + 6
   - r/b = 5/3

2. From the second equation (r/b = 5/3), we can write:
   3r = 5b

3. Substitute r from the first equation:
   3(b + 6) = 5b
   3b + 18 = 5b
   18 = 2b
   b = 9

4. Then r = b + 6 = 15

5. Therefore, r + b = 15 + 9 = 24

The ground truth answer is 24, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 9 + 15, which is also equal to 24. 

The answers are mathematically equivalent, just written in different forms (one simplified, one as a sum).
