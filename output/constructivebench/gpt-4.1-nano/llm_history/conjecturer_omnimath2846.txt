Given the equation \(3m^3 = 5n^5\), and the sum \(m + n = k\), the minimal \(k\) occurs when \(m\) and \(n\) are minimal positive integers satisfying the relation. The smallest positive solution is \(m=5^2\), \(n=3^3\), leading to \(k=5^2 + 3^3 = 25 + 27 = 52\). Thus, the minimal sum is 52.

<<<52>>>
