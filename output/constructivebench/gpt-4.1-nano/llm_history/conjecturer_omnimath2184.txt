The pattern suggests the answer relates to the divisibility condition and the symmetry over the finite set. Given that the sum of weighted x_i is divisible by 2012, and each x_i is between 0 and 2011, the total number of solutions corresponds to the number of solutions to a linear congruence constrained by bounds. The counting reduces to (2011 / gcd(2012, 2011)). Since gcd(2012, 2011) = 1, the count simplifies. Assuming the solutions follow a uniform distribution across possible x_i values, total solutions approximate \(2012^{2012 - 1} = 2012^{2011}\).
