theorem omnimath2490 :
  (∑ k in Finset.Icc 1 30303, k ^ k) % 101 = omnimath2490_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Because the sum over \(k^k\) for \(k=1\) to 30303 modulo 101 exhibits a pattern similar to a periodic or a known number-theoretic property, and considering the pattern in enumerated answers, the sum likely reduces to 0 modulo 101.
