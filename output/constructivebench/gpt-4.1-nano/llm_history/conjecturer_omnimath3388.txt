Based on the pattern of the equations, subtract and manipulate to eliminate variables. The solution simplifies to a constant tuple satisfying all equations simultaneously. The values align with the intersection of the lines defined by the equations. The consistent solution across all equations is (0, 1, 1). 

<<<(0, 1, 1)>>>
