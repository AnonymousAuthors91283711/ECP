theorem olympiadbench2638 :
  ∃! Y, Y < 10 ∧ (∀ X, X < 10 → ¬ (11 ∣ 1230000 + X * 1000 + 5 * 100 + Y * 10 + 7)) ∧ Y = olympiadbench2638_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests Y is the digit that makes the number \(1230000 + X \times 1000 + 560 + 7\) indivisible by 11 for all \(X<10\). Since Y must be unique and less than 10, and the number's divisibility depends on Y, the consistent candidate is Y = 3, which satisfies the exclusivity.
