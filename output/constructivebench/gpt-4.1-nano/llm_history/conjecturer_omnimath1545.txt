The problem involves a maximum m where a strictly increasing sequence is embedded in a 2D grid with some constraints. Based on the pattern, the key is the length of the sequence, which is limited by n but also must satisfy the increasing conditions along both axes. The maximum m before reaching n+1 elements with these properties is n, given the constraints.
