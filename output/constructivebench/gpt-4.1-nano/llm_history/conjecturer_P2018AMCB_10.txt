The pattern suggests the minimal length list with counts summing to exactly 10, where the counts do not exceed 10 and each element is positive. To minimize the list length for a fixed total count of 10, all counts should be 1, resulting in 10 elements. This yields the minimal k as 10. 

Final answer in Lean:

<<<10>>>
