  (∃ k : ℕ, (a^3 * b - 1) = k * (a + 1)) ∧ (∃ m : ℕ, (b^3 * a + 1) = m * (b - 1)) ↔ (a, b) ∈ omnimath293_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 2), (1, 3), (3, 3)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b) | (a > 0 ∧ b > 0) ∧ (b - 1 ∣ a^3 * b + 1) ∧ (a + 1 ∣ a^3 * b - 1)}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is close but not exactly equivalent to the ground truth. The main differences are:
1. The proposed answer uses a general condition while the ground truth gives specific solutions
2. The proposed answer has a sign error in the first divisibility condition (should be b-1 divides b³*a+1, not a³*b+1)
3. The proposed answer doesn't restrict to natural number solutions like the ground truth does

The proposed answer captures the general form but has these technical inaccuracies.
