The set describes the minimal radius r that works for all points p, centered at some c, satisfying dist p c ≤ r, ensuring |p.1 + |p.2|| ≤ 1. The optimal c is at (0,0), minimizing the maximum |x + |y||. Since the maximum occurs at points where x + |y| = ±1, the minimal largest radius is 0.5. Therefore:
<<<0.5>>>
