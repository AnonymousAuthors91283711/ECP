Ground Truth Answer: 15
Proposed Answer: 25 * 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation given is: 3*3*5*5*7*9 = 3*3*7*x*x
2. Simplifying both sides:
   - Left side: 3*3*5*5*7*9 = (3²)*(5²)*7*9
   - Right side: (3²)*7*x²
3. Canceling common terms (3²*7) from both sides gives: 5²*9 = x²
4. Therefore x² = 25*9 = 225
5. So x = √225 = 15

The ground truth answer is 15, which is correct.

The proposed answer is "25 * 9", which equals 225. This is actually x² (225) rather than x (15). The answer gives the square of the correct value.
