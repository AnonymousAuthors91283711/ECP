Based on the divisor count 861 and known divisor functions, the number n must be the product of prime powers fitting the divisor formula. The prime factorization corresponding to divisor count 861 is \(3^4 \times 5^4\), yielding divisor count (4+1)*(4+1)=25, which is too small. Recognizing pattern and constraints, the only feasible n with exactly 861 divisors is n=720, where 720's divisors count is (6+1)*(4+1)*(2+1)=7*5*3=105, too small. Proceeding with divisor enumeration, the consistent value is n=2560, which matches the divisor count of 861 when factored as 2^8 * 5. The number of divisors is (8+1)*(1+1)=9*2=18, not 861, so reassessment is needed. The divisor count 861 factors as 3*287, with 287=7*41, so n's prime factorization might be 3^1 * 7^1 * 41^1, and divisor count (1+1)*(1+1)*(1+1)=2*2*2=8, too small. The correct consistent factorization for divisor count 861 with three primes is 3^2 * 7^2 * 41^2, giving (2+1)*(2+1)*(2+1)=3*3*3=27 divisors, still too small. Given the pattern and constraints, the only such n is 1024, which is 2^{10} with 11 divisors, still inconsistent. Recognizing a pattern in the divisor counts, the only n matching the divisor count 861 is 1024 (2^{10}), but 1024 has 11 divisors, not 861. Therefore, the only prime power fitting is 2^{860} with (860+1)=861 divisors. 

Final conjecture: n=2^{860}.
