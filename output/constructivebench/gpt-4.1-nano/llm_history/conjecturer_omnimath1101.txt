The original equation simplifies to 2^m * n - 2^n * m = 2^k. Recognizing the symmetry and bounds, the only solutions within 0 ≤ k, m, n ≤ 100 are when m = n, leading to 0 = 2^k, hence k = 0. For m ≠ n, the difference involves powers of 2 multiplying m and n respectively, only balancing at m = n. Including the bounds, the count of solutions is just when m = n, and k = 0. For each m = n, n runs from 0 to 100, giving 101 solutions at k=0. 

Thus, the total number of solutions:

<<<101>>>
