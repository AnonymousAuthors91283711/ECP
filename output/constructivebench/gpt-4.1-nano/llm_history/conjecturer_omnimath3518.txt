theorem omnimath3518 (input : ℕ) : 
  ((input - 8) / 2) + 16 = 32 ↔ input = omnimath3518_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The equation ((input - 8) / 2) + 16 = 32 simplifies to (input - 8) / 2 = 16, leading to input - 8 = 32, so input = 40. With generalized form in Lean, answer is 2 * 16 + 8 = 40. 

<<<40>>>
