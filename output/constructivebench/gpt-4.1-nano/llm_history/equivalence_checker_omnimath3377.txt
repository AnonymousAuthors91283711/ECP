Ground Truth Answer: X^4 - 2*X^3 - 13*X^2 + 14*X + 24
Proposed Answer: X^4 + 2*X^3 - 13*X^2 + 14*X - 24
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves finding a polynomial (omnimath3377_answer) such that for all x not roots of P, Q.eval(x²)/P.eval(x) equals omnimath3377_answer.eval(x).

2. Given P = X⁴ + 2X³ - 13X² - 14X + 24, we can find its roots: ±1, ±3, ±4, ±2 (but need to verify which are actual roots).

3. The ground truth answer is X⁴ - 2X³ - 13X² + 14X + 24.

4. The proposed answer is X⁴ + 2X³ - 13X² + 14X - 24.

Comparing coefficients:
- Ground truth: [24, 14, -13, -2, 1]
- Proposed: [-24, 14, -13, 2, 1]

The coefficients differ in:
1. Constant term (24 vs -24)
2. Linear term coefficient (14 vs 14) - same
3. Quadratic term (-13 vs -13) - same
4. Cubic term (-2 vs 2) - different sign
5. Quartic term (1 vs 1) - same

The differences are significant in both the constant term and the cubic term's sign. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
