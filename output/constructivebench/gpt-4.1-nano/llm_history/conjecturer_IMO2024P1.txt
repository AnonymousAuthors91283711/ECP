theorem IMO2024P1 (α : ℝ) :
  (∀ n : ℕ, 0 < n → (n : ℤ) ∣ (∑ i in Finset.range n, ⌊(i + 1) * α⌋)) ↔ α ∈ IMO2024P1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The answer set consists of all real numbers α where the sum of floors divides n and the floor values are consistent with a linear function scaled by α. If the sum over i=0 to n-1 of ⌊(i+1) * α⌋ is divisible by n, then α must be rational with denominator dividing n. Unifying over all n, the natural candidate set is α ∈ ℚ that are rational with denominator dividing some n. The set can be characterized as rationals; removing metadata about n:
