  ∃! (p : ℕ × ℕ), 0 < p.1 ∧ p.1 ≤ p.2 ∧ p.1 * p.2 = 24 ∧ p.1 + p.2 = 11 ∧ p.2 - p.1 = omnimath2954_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The given conditions are \( p.1 \times p.2 = 24 \), \( p.1 + p.2 = 11 \), with \( p.1 > 0 \). The integer pair satisfying these equations is \( (3,8) \). The value \( p.2 - p.1 = 8 - 3 = 5 \). Thus, the unique answer is 5.
