  (digits 10 (11 * 101 * 111 * 110011)).sum = omnimath1566_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern of the product 11 * 101 * 111 * 110011, the sum of its digits appears to be the sum of the digits of the product, which can be computed directly. The product equals 1610516100, which has the digit sum of 1+6+1+0+5+1+6+1+0+0 = 21. 

<<<21>>>
