theorem omnimath1191
    (x y z w : ℝ)
    (h : 2 * x + y + z + w = 1 ∧ x + 3 * y + z + w = 2 ∧ x + y + 4 * z + w = 3 ∧ x + y + z + 5 * w = 25) :
    w = omnimath1191_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the system of linear equations, the variable w appears consistently with coefficients 1, 1, 1, and 5, and the sum constraints suggest a linear pattern. Using elimination, the value for w simplifies to a fixed real number. The pattern suggests w is 4.
