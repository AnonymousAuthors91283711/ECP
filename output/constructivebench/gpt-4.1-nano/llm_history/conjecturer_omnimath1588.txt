The pattern suggests that the sum of cosines over angles equally spaced amounts to a constant multiple related to sine sums, hinting at a geometric series. Considering the symmetry around 180°, the sum simplifies to a ratio involving tangent. Conjecture: the ratio approaches 1, as the sums are approximately equal due to symmetry.
