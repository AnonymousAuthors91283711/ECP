Let's analyze the constraints:

- r divides 702, 787, 855 with the same remainder r
- s divides 412, 722, 815 with the same remainder s
- s ≠ r, and both are positive

The divisibility conditions imply:

- 702 - r ≡ 0 mod m, 787 - r ≡ 0 mod m, 855 - r ≡ 0 mod m
- Similarly for n with the other numbers

The common remainders suggest that:

r is the common remainder of these three numbers modulo m and n respectively. The difference of pairs:

- 855 - 702=153, 787 -702=85, 855 -787=68
- 815 - 412=403, 722 - 412=310, 815 - 722=93

Likewise, s divides differences among 412, 722, 815.

To satisfy all, the possible r and s are factors of these differences:

- For r, gcd(153,85,68)=1
- For s, gcd(403,310,93)=1

Given positive s ≠ r, the minimal such sum is when r=1 and s=2.

Therefore, the sum m + n + r + s corresponds to the minimal positive values:

- r=1, s=2

Sum analysis:

From the above, it's consistent to determine the total sum as

m + n + 1 + 2

The problem appears to settle at a constant sum, likely 702 + 412 + 1 + 2. 

But generally, given the modular constraints, the constants involved are:

- For m, 702, 787, 855 have common divisor 15 (since all 3 are 3 mod15)

- For n, 412, 722, 815 have gcd 1 apart from 1, implying minimal solution involves choosing s=1 or 2 to satisfy inequalities.

Concluding, the sum likely simplifies to： 702 + 412 + 1 + 2=1117.

**Final answer in Lean syntax:**

<<<702 + 412 + 1 + 2>>>
