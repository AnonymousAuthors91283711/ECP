Ground Truth Answer: 103
Proposed Answer: 102
Let me analyze this problem carefully.

The problem is asking for the smallest number n > 101 where the rightmost non-zero digit of n! matches the rightmost non-zero digit of 101!.

Key observations:
1. The rightmost non-zero digit is affected by both the trailing zeros (removed by dividing by 10^padicVal) and the last non-zero digit of what remains.
2. For factorials, the rightmost non-zero digit cycles in a certain pattern after certain points.

Looking at the ground truth (103) vs proposed answer (102):
- 101! = ... ends with some non-zero digit D
- 102! = 102 × 101!, so its rightmost non-zero digit would be (2 × D) mod 10
- 103! = 103 × 102! = 103 × 102 × 101!, and since 103 mod 10 is 3, its rightmost non-zero digit would be (3 × 2 × D) mod 10 = (6 × D) mod 10

For them to match, we'd need (2 × D) ≡ D mod 10 (for 102) or (6 × D) ≡ D mod 10 (for 103). The equation (6D ≡ D mod 10) simplifies to 5D ≡ 0 mod 10, which means D must be even. This is more likely to occur than (2D ≡ D mod 10) which would require D ≡ 0 mod 10 (impossible since D is non-zero).

Therefore, 103 is more likely to be the correct answer than 102. The proposed answer (102) is incorrect.
