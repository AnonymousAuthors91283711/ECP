The sum of a geometric series is \( a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \). Given the two equations, eliminating \(a\) and solving for \( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a r^k \), the pattern suggests the third sum is proportional to the two previous sums. The ratio is consistent with the sum scale: 

\( \frac{1 - r^{6022}}{1 - r^{4022}} \) multiplied by 380 gives the third sum. Simplifying, the sum becomes \( 380 \times \frac{1 - r^{6022}}{1 - r^{4022}} \).

The main problem with the proposed answer is that in Lean, string-style LaTeX expressions like \(\frac{1 - r^{6022}}{1 - r^{4022}}\) need to be written explicitly using division `/`. The current expression uses LaTeX syntax inside a Lean expression, which causes the syntax error.

Given the hints and pattern, the sum formula for the geometric series sum from \(k=0\) to \(n-1\) is:

\[ \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a r^{k} = a \frac{1 - r^{n}}{1 - r} \]

From the problem, for the ranges:

- sum over \(0..2009\): \(a \frac{1 - r^{2010}}{1 - r} = 200 \)

- sum over \(0..4021\): \(a \frac{1 - r^{4022}}{1 - r} = 380 \)

We want the sum over \(0..6032\); correspondingly, it reduces to a proportional segment.

Eliminating \(a\), as the sums are proportional, the third sum relates to previous sums via the ratio:

\[
\frac{1 - r^{6022}}{1 - r^{4022}} \times 380
\]

Thus, in Lean syntax, the answer should be:

```lean
(380 * (1 - r^6022)) / (1 - r^4022)
```

This matches the observed pattern and uses proper Lean syntax, avoiding the LaTeX style of expression.

The error indicates that `r` is not recognized in the definition of `P2011AIMEII_5_answer`. In Lean, variables like `a` and `r` are parameters of the theorem, not accessible directly inside an abbrev unless explicitly included or used inside the scope of the theorem. To define a closed-form answer dependent on `a` and `r`, the abbrev must be parametrized or the theorem provided as a function.

Since the answer involves `a` and `r`, and the sum formulas for geometric series are well-known, the general closed form for the sum ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} a * r^k is:

\[ a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \]

Given the problem sums proceeds over ranges starting from 0 (via Finset.range), the first sum is from `k=0` to `k=2010`. The second sum up to `k=4021`, and the third sum up to `k=6032`.

Assuming the sums are geometric series:

- The first sum: \( S_1 = a \frac{1 - r^{2011}}{1 - r} \)

- The second sum: \( S_2 = a \frac{1 - r^{4022}}{1 - r} \)

- The third sum: \( S_3 = a \frac{1 - r^{6033}}{1 - r} \)

Given the relations:

\[ S_1 = 200 \]
\[ S_2 = 380 \]
and the goal is to find \( S_3 \), identical to the sum over 6033 terms.

Expressing \( a \) from the first sum:

\[ a = 200 * \frac{1 - r}{1 - r^{2011}} \]

using the second sum:

\[ 380 = a * \frac{1 - r^{4022}}{1 - r} \]

Substitute \( a \):

\[ 380 = 200 * \frac{1 - r}{1 - r^{2011}} * \frac{1 - r^{4022}}{1 - r} = 200 * \frac{1 - r^{4022}}{1 - r^{2011}} \]

solving for this relation can be used to connect the powers of \( r \). Then, the sum \( S_3 \):

\[ S_3 = a * \frac{1 - r^{6033}}{1 - r} \]

Expressed in terms of known quantities, it becomes:

\[ S_3 = 200 * \frac{1 - r^{6033}}{1 - r^{2011}} \]

or, alternatively, in terms of the known sums:

\[ S_3 = a * \frac{1 - r^{6033}}{1 - r} \]

but as the question asks for a closed form ignoring \( a \), and the natural pattern indicates expressing the sum directly in the form of geometric series.

Because the proportion between sums is governed by the ratio of the geometric series terms, and since the total sum is over 6033 terms:

\[
\boxed{
\sum_{k=0}^{6032} a r^k = a \frac{1 - r^{6033}}{1 - r}
}
\]

which in closed form, consistent with geometric series sum, is best represented as:

```lean
<<<(a * (1 - r^6033)) / (1 - r)>>
```

However, for a formula independent of `a` provided in the problem (assuming `a` is fixed), the best closed form that connects all sums is:

```lean
<<<(380 * (1 - r^6033)) / (1 - r^4022)>>
```

assuming the general form resembles the pattern from the previous sums.

Hence, the corrected and general form answer, replacing the undefined `r`, is:

The core idea relies on the geometric series sum formula: \(\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1-r}\). Here, the summations are over \(\operatorname{range} n = \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}\). Since the problem uses `Finset.range n`, which matches the set of integers from 0 to n-1, the sum formula applies directly.

The given sums start at \(k=0\) (since `range n` starts from 0), so:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a r^k = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}
\]

Given the two sums:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{2010} a r^k = 200
\]
and
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{4021} a r^k = 380
\]

which correspond directly to the geometric series sums:
\[
a \frac{1 - r^{2011}}{1 - r} = 200
\]
and
\[
a \frac{1 - r^{4022}}{1 - r} = 380
\]

We wish to find:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{6032} a r^k = a \frac{1 - r^{6033}}{1 - r}
\]

Thus, the answer in closed form is:
\[
a \frac{1 - r^{6033}}{1 - r}
\]

Since the code attempted to use `<<<` syntax, which is invalid in Lean for defining an expression, the correct syntax is just to assign the rational expression directly.

**Final answer in Lean syntax:**

>>> (a * (1 - r^6033)) / (1 - r) <<<

This matches the standard geometric series sum formula, correctly extended to the specified upper limit.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Given the structure of geometric sums involved and the pattern of the partial sums, we recognize that the sums are of the form:

\[ S(n) = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a r^k = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \quad \text{for } r \neq 1 \]

The two given equations are:

\[
a \frac{1 - r^{2011}}{1 - r} = 200, \quad
a \frac{1 - r^{4022}}{1 - r} = 380
\]

Dividing the second by the first:

\[
\frac{1 - r^{4022}}{1 - r^{2011}} = \frac{380}{200} = \frac{19}{10}
\]

Noting that \(4022 = 2 \times 2011\), we rewrite:

\[
\frac{1 - r^{2 \times 2011}}{1 - r^{2011}} = \frac{19}{10}
\]
which simplifies via the sum of a geometric series:

\[
\frac{(1 - r^{2011})(1 + r^{2011})}{1 - r^{2011}} = 1 + r^{2011} = \frac{19}{10}
\]
hence,

\[
r^{2011} = \frac{9}{10}
\]

Substituting back into the first sum:

\[
a \frac{1 - r^{2011}}{1 - r} = 200
\]
and since \(r^{2011} = 9/10\),

\[
a \frac{1 - 9/10}{1 - r} = 200 \Rightarrow a \frac{1/10}{1 - r} = 200
\]
which gives:

\[
a = 200 \times (1 - r) \times 10 = 2000 (1 - r)
\]

Finally, the third sum:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{6032} a r^{k} = a \frac{1 - r^{6033}}{1 - r}
\]
becomes:

\[
a \frac{1 - r^{6033}}{1 - r}
\]

Since the total sum:

\[
a \frac{1 - r^{6033}}{1 - r}
\]

we substitute \(a = 2000 (1 - r)\):

\[
2000 (1 - r) \times \frac{1 - r^{6033}}{1 - r} = 2000 (1 - r^{6033})
\]

Recall that:

\[
r^{2011} = \frac{9}{10} \Rightarrow r^{6033} = (r^{2011})^{3} = \left(\frac{9}{10}\right)^3 = \frac{729}{1000}
\]

Thus, the third sum evaluates to:

\[
2000 \left(1 - \frac{729}{1000}\right) = 2000 \times \frac{271}{1000} = 2000 \times \frac{271}{1000} = 2 \times 271. = 542
\]

**Final Answer in Lean syntax (closed form):**

<<<2000 * (1 - r^{6033})>>>
