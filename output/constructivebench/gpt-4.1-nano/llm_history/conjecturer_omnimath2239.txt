Given the symmetry of the equations, the pattern suggests rewriting terms to isolate differences. The numerators involve squared variables, and the denominators are sums, which implies a symmetric solution with respect to the variables. The constants 20 and 14 appear to relate to the differences among the variables squared. From the pattern and sums involved, the likely value for x combines these constants into a quadratic form, leading to x = 34.

The errors indicate that in the definition of omnimath2239_answer, the variables a, b, c are not recognized because they are not in scope. In Lean, to define an answer as a specific expression depending on these variables, the variables must be either introduced as parameters or the expression must be written as a function of these variables.

Given the problem setup, the variable placeholders a, b, and c are parameters to the theorem, but when defining the answer as an abbrev outside the theorem, unless explicitly parametrized, they are not in scope. The most straightforward correction is to define omnimath2239_answer as a function of a, b, c, i.e.,:

abbrev omnimath2239_answer (a b c : ℝ) : ℝ := (a + b + c)^2 - 68

which then can be referenced inside the theorem with the variables a, b, c.

Alternatively, if the answer is supposed to be a fixed number (say, under some conditions imposed by the constraints), then you need a concrete value for a, b, c.

Since the problem presumes the variables are parameters, the best fix is to define the answer as a function of a, b, c.

Final fixed answer:

The purpose of `abbrev omnimath2239_answer : ℝ := ...` is to define a closed-form real number expression that satisfies the relations derived from the problem's conditions. The error arises because defining a lambda function `(a b c => ...)` does not directly instantiate a real constant (`ℝ`). Instead, I need to provide a specific real expression—which is independent of `a, b, c`—suggesting a fixed value for `x`. 

From the typical patterns and the enumeration hint, it appears the value `x` is a fixed numeric constant. Given the structure `(a + b + c)^2 - 68` in the proposed answer, and the error that suggests it is attempting to define a function, I will fix this by defining `omnimath2239_answer` directly as a constant real number without lambda abstraction.

Also, since the symbol used in the error is `(a + b + c)^2 - 68`, the probable intended value for `x` (which is the right hand side of the third relation), is the real number `-68`. This makes sense if the sum of the squared ratios plus constants reduces to this fixed value, consistent with the enumeration pattern.

**Final Fix:** Remove the lambda function, directly assign the numerical value as a real constant.  
Answer: `-68`
