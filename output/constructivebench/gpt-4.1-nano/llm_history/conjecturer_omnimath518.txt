noncomputable abbrev omnimath518_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath518 :
  ∀ a b c : ℝ, a ≠ 0 ∧ b ≠ 0 ∧ c ≠ 0 ∧ a + b + c = 0 ∧ a ^ 3 + b ^ 3 + c ^ 3 = a ^ 5 + b ^ 5 + c ^ 5 → a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 + c ^ 2 = omnimath518_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the symmetry and the constraints \(a + b + c = 0\) and the relations involving odd powers, the pattern suggests the relation reduces to a specific constant. The enumeration hints at the response being a fixed real number. Considering typical identities and symmetry, the expected answer is 3, as it aligns with identities involving sums of squares when the sum of variables is zero.
