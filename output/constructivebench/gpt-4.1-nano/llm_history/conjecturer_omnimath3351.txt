: ∃! n : ℕ, n < 10 ∧ 91 ∣ 12345 * 10^4 + n * 10^3 + 789 ↔ n = omnimath3351_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Because 91 divides the expression and fixing n < 10, the pattern suggests n = 5 (since 12345 * 10^4 + n * 10^3 + 789 satisfies that divisibility when n=5).  
Final answer: <<<5>>>
