theorem P2014AIMEI_2 (N : ℕ) (hN : N > 0) :
  (4 * 16 + 6 * N) / (10 * (16 + N)) = 58/100 ↔ N = P2014AIMEI_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The enumeration pattern suggests the answer is derived from solving the equation for N. Simplifying (4*16 + 6N)/(10*(16+N)) = 58/100 yields N = 8.
