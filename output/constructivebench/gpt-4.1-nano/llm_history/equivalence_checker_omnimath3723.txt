Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1)}
Proposed Answer: { p : ℕ × ℕ | p.2 = 1 ∧ Nat.Prime p.1 }
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is asking when a⁴ + 4b⁴ is prime, given positive natural numbers a and b.

The ground truth answer suggests the only solution is (1,1). Let's verify:
- For (1,1): 1⁴ + 4*1⁴ = 5 which is prime
- For any other (a,b):
  - If b > 1, the expression is clearly >5 and divisible by b
  - If b=1 and a>1, we can factor a⁴ + 4 = (a² - 2a + 2)(a² + 2a + 2), which shows it's composite unless a=1

The proposed answer is { p : ℕ × ℕ | p.2 = 1 ∧ Nat.Prime p.1 }, which would include pairs like (2,1), (3,1), etc. But:
- (2,1): 2⁴ + 4*1⁴ = 16 + 4 = 20 (not prime)
- (3,1): 3⁴ + 4*1⁴ = 81 + 4 = 85 (not prime)

The proposed answer is incorrect because it includes many pairs that don't satisfy the condition. Only (1,1) works.
