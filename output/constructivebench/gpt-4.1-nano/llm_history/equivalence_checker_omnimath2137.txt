abbrev omnimath2137_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2137 : 
  (∑ i in Finset.range 2013, (digits 4 (i+1)).length) = omnimath2137_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 12345
Proposed Answer: (2013 + 1) * (Nat.log 4 (2013 + 1) + 1) / 2 * 2
Let me analyze this problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem asks for the sum of the lengths (number of digits) of all numbers from 1 to 2013 when written in base 4.

2. The ground truth answer is 12345 (given as correct).

3. The proposed answer attempts to use a formula that seems to be:
   - (n+1) * (log₄(n+1) + 1) / 2 * 2
   - Which simplifies to (n+1) * (log₄(n+1) + 1)

4. The proposed formula is incorrect because:
   - It doesn't properly account for the varying number of digits in different ranges
   - The sum of digit lengths doesn't follow this simple logarithmic pattern
   - The simplification is mathematically incorrect for this problem

5. The correct approach would involve:
   - Calculating how many numbers have 1 digit, 2 digits, etc. in base 4
   - Then summing count × digit_length for each group

The proposed answer is completely different from the ground truth and based on incorrect reasoning.
