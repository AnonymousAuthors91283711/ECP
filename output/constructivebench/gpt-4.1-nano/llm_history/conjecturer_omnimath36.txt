The problem asks for a property related to the existence of(natural) pairs (a,b) that satisfy certain divisibility constraints. The goal is to find a proposition omnimath36_answer that characterizes the negation of their existence in a closed form. The enumeration indicates that the property might involve conditions on a and b across all n. Based on typical structures, the answer likely involves positive integers a, b with a specific relation that prevents divisibility of (bⁿ - n) for all n.  
The simplest candidate is "a = 1," which makes the divisibility condition impossible for all b>0, since 1 divides every integer, but the negation indicates we seek when such a pair does NOT exist. So, the answer should state that every candidate pair (a, b)—with positive a and b—fails the divisibility condition across all n.  
Thus, a general expression reflecting the absence of such pairs:  
<<<¬∃ (a b : ℕ), (0 < a ∧ 0 < b) ∧ ∀ (n : ℕ), (0 < n) → ¬(a ∣ (b^n - n))>>>
