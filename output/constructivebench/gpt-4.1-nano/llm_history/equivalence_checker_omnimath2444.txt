Ground Truth Answer: 65536
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n ≥ 2 where we can't partition the numbers {2,...,n} into two sets S and T such that neither set contains any solution to a^b = c (where a,b,c are all in the same set).

2. The ground truth answer is 65536, which makes sense because:
   - For n < 65536, we can partition numbers into "primes" and "non-primes" to avoid a^b = c
   - At 65536, we have 2^16 = 65536, which forces both 2 and 16 into the same set (since 2^16 is in the range), making it impossible to partition without creating a solution in one set

3. The proposed answer is 4, which is incorrect because:
   - For n=4, we can partition {2,3,4} into S={2,3} and T={4}, which satisfies all conditions
   - There's no a^b = c possible in either set with this partition

The proposed answer is much too small and doesn't match the correct solution.
