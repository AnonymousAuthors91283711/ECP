Theorems suggest identifying specific pencil and eraser costs satisfying 13 * pencilCost + 3 * eraserCost = 100 with constraints. Since the enumeration pattern points toward a linear relation, the minimal solution occurs at eraserCost = 4, pencilCost = 7, leading to total 11. Extending this pattern to general solution yields total as 13, which satisfies the constraints.
