Ground Truth Answer: {2400, 1350, 864}
Proposed Answer: {60 * 120 / 2, 30 * 60 / 2, 120 * 180 / 2}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem describes a set of real numbers A that satisfy certain conditions involving a Pythagorean triple (a, b, c) in arithmetic progression, with one of the numbers being 60, and A being the area of the right triangle formed by a and b.

2. The ground truth answer gives three specific values: {2400, 1350, 864}.

3. The proposed answer gives expressions that evaluate to:
   - 60 * 120 / 2 = 3600
   - 30 * 60 / 2 = 900
   - 120 * 180 / 2 = 10800

4. Comparing the values:
   - None of the proposed values (3600, 900, 10800) match the ground truth (2400, 1350, 864).
   - The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the arithmetic progression condition (b - a = c - b) for the given values.
