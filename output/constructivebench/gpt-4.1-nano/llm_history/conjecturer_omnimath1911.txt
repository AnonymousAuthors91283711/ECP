theorem omnimath1911 :
  let S := Icc 1 6
  let A := card (Finset.univ : Finset (Sym2 (S ×ˢ S)))
  let B := card (Finset.univ : Finset (Sym2 S × Sym2 S))
  A - B = omnimath1911_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given that A = #Sym2(1..6) and B = #Sym2(1..6)×Sym2(1..6), the difference accounts for pairs with symmetry considerations. For symmetric pairs over 6 elements, the count reflects combinations with potential symmetry reduction. The count of symmetric pairs over n elements is n(n+1)/2, and pairs over symmetric pairs are (n(n+1)/2)^2. The difference simplifies to n(n+1)/2, which for n=6: 6*7/2=21.
