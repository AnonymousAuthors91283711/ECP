Based on the pattern (1/6 + 1/(3 * (-2)^k)), the simplified closed form is independent of particular values of k. Recognizing that the second term oscillates and diminishes, the core sum converges to 1/6 as k increases. Therefore, a natural closed form giving the explicit value for all k > 0 is:

<<<fun k : ℕ => 1/6 + 1 / (3 * (-2)^k)>>>
