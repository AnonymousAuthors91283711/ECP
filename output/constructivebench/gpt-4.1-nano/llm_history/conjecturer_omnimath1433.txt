Based on the pattern in the enumerated answers, it appears the function assigns distinct values with the restriction that an odd difference implies different outputs. For classification, this resembles an independent set removing conflicts when indices differ by odd numbers. The pattern suggests the maximum size is achieved by partitioning into two classes (even and odd), and choosing the larger partition.
