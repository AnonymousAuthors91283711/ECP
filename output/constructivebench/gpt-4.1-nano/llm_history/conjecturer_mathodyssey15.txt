theorem mathodyssey15 :
  let x := (sqrt 2 + sqrt 5) ^ 2000
  let n := ⌊x⌋.toNat
  let d := ⌊10 * (x - n)⌋.toNat
  n.digits 10 = [1] ∧ d = 9 ↔ (n, d) = mathodyssey15_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
The pattern suggests `n` is close to (√2 + √5)^{2000} with leading digit 1 and the fractional part scaled by 10 gives 9, indicating n ≈ 1 * 10^{k}. Given the exponential form and known algebraic properties, the leading digit is 1, and the fractional scaled part is 9. The values stabilize to n = 10^k and d = 9. 

Final answer:
<<<(1, 9)>>>
