abbrev omnimath3543_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3543 :
  (1 / 2 + 2 / 4 + 4 / 8 + 8 / 16 = omnimath3543_answer) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: (1 : ℝ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem shows a sum of fractions: 1/2 + 2/4 + 4/8 + 8/16
2. Each fraction simplifies to 1/2:
   - 1/2 = 1/2
   - 2/4 = 1/2
   - 4/8 = 1/2
   - 8/16 = 1/2
3. There are 4 terms, each equal to 1/2, so the sum is 4 * (1/2) = 2

The ground truth answer is 2, which is correct.
The proposed answer is 1, which is incorrect.
