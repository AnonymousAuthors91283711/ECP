Ground Truth Answer: ((1 + 2^1005) / 2^1007)^2
Proposed Answer: 1 / 64
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting valid paths in a 2D grid where each step is one of 4 diagonal moves, and we want paths of length 2012 that end at a position divisible by 8 in both coordinates.

2. The ground truth answer ((1 + 2^1005)/2^1007)^2 comes from:
   - Considering the x and y coordinates separately (they're independent)
   - Each coordinate is a random walk with steps ±1
   - For n=2012 steps, we need the sum ≡0 mod8
   - The probability for one coordinate is (1 + 2^(n/2))/2^(n/2 + 1) = (1 + 2^1006)/2^1007
   - Squaring gives the probability for both coordinates

3. The proposed answer 1/64 is incorrect because:
   - It's much simpler than the ground truth
   - Doesn't account for the large number of steps (2012)
   - Would only be correct for very small n where the central limit theorem doesn't apply
