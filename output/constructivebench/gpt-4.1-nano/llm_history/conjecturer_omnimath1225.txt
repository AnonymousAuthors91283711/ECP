theorem omnimath1225 :
  ∃ (r s : ℕ), Nat.Coprime r s ∧
  (r : ℝ) / s = (2 * (sqrt 2 + sqrt 10)) / (5 * sqrt (3 + sqrt 5)) ∧
  (r, s) = omnimath1225_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
The value involves algebraic expressions with nested radicals. The numerator has (2 * (sqrt 2 + sqrt 10)) and the denominator involves (5 * sqrt (3 + sqrt 5)). Simplifying the radical quotient suggests rationalizing and expressing as coprime integers. Based on pattern recognition and factoring, the simplest coprime integers representing this ratio are r = 2 and s = 11. 

<<<(2, 11)>>>
