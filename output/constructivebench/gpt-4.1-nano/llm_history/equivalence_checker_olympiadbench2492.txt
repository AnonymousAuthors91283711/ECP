Ground Truth Answer: 2/5
Proposed Answer: (4 : ℚ) / 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating the probability that a^b is even when:
   - a ∈ {1,2,3,4,5}
   - b ∈ {6,7,8}
   - Total possible pairs: 5 × 3 = 15 (Ω.card)

2. For a^b to be even, a must be even (since odd^any = odd)
   - Even a's: {2,4} (2 options)
   - For each even a, all b's (6,7,8) will make a^b even
   - Total even cases: 2 × 3 = 6

3. Probability = even_count / Ω.card = 6/15 = 2/5 (simplified)

The ground truth answer is correct (2/5), while the proposed answer is 4/5, which is incorrect.
