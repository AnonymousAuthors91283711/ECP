abbrev omnimath3464_answer : ℤ → ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath3464 (n : ℤ) : Odd (omnimath3464_answer n) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℤ → ℤ
Because the theorem states that the answer is odd for all integers n, the answer function should always produce an odd integer, generalized from examples to a constant value. A simple consistent choice is 1, which is odd, for all n. 

Thus, the proposed answer:

<<<fun n : ℤ => 1>>>
