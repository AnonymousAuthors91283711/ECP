Ground Truth Answer: 44
Proposed Answer: 52
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. We have two equations:
   - 4S = 7B (from S * 4 = B * 7)
   - S = B + 12

2. Substitute the second equation into the first:
   4(B + 12) = 7B
   4B + 48 = 7B
   48 = 3B
   B = 16

3. Then S = B + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28

4. Therefore, S + B = 28 + 16 = 44

The ground truth answer is correct (44), while the proposed answer (52) is incorrect. The calculations clearly show the correct sum is 44, not 52.

<<<False>>>
