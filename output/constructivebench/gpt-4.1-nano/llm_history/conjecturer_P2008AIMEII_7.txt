    P2008AIMEII_7_answer r s t = 753 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℤ → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ
The roots of the polynomial \(X^3 - 8X^2 - 200X + 2008\) are related to the coefficients via Viète's formulas: sum \(r + s + t = 8\), product \(rst = -2008\), and other symmetric sums. Based on the pattern from enumerated solutions and the symmetry, the answer combines these sums.  
Final expression:
<<<fun r s t : ℤ => r + s + t + r * s * t>>>
