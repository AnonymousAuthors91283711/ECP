theorem omnimath645 : 
  let total := Nat.choose 8 2 * Nat.choose 6 2 * Nat.choose 4 2 * Nat.choose 2 2 / 24
  let valid := Nat.choose 4 2 * Nat.choose 2 2 / 2 * Nat.choose 4 2 * Nat.choose 2 2 / 2
  (valid : ℚ) / (total : ℚ) = omnimath645_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 3 / 35
Proposed Answer: 1/3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating a probability ratio of valid configurations to total possible configurations.

2. Calculating total:
- Nat.choose 8 2 = 28
- Nat.choose 6 2 = 15
- Nat.choose 4 2 = 6
- Nat.choose 2 2 = 1
- Total numerator: 28 × 15 × 6 × 1 = 2520
- Divided by 24: 2520/24 = 105

3. Calculating valid:
- First part: Nat.choose 4 2 = 6, Nat.choose 2 2 = 1 → 6 × 1 / 2 = 3
- Second part: same → 3
- Valid numerator: 3 × 3 = 9

4. Final ratio: 9/105 = 3/35 (after simplifying by dividing numerator and denominator by 3)

The ground truth answer is correct (3/35), while the proposed answer (1/3) is incorrect.
