6 * 1000 + K * 100 + 0 * 10 + L - (M * 1000 + 9 * 100 + N * 10 + 4) = 2011 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the answer involves the fixed constants and the digits K, L, M, N in a way that satisfies the equation. Based on the enumeration, the constant terms 6*1000 and 9*100 correspond to parameter positions, leading to the simplified form. 

The expression simplifies to K*100 + L - (M*1000 + 9*100 + N*10 + 4) + 2011, with the constants forming the fixed part of the answer. Thus, the total sum K + L + M + N corresponds to the maximum digit expression when the equation holds.

Given the pattern, I propose the final answer as:

<<<(6 * 1000) + (9 * 100) + 4>>>
