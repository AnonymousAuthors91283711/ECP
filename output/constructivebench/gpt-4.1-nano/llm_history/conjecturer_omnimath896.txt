  IsGreatest {z : ℝ | ∃ x' y' : ℝ, 0 < x' ∧ 0 < y' ∧ x'^2 - x'*y' + 2*y'^2 = 8 ∧ z = x'^2 + x'*y' + 2*y'^2} 
  (omnimath896_answer x y) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
Given the symmetry and quadratic form, the maximum occurs at specific critical points. Pattern suggests the answer involves a quadratic expression in x and y.
<<<fun x y => x^2 + x * y + 2 * y^2>>>
