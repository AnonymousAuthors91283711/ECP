Ground Truth Answer: 899
Proposed Answer: 28
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us:
   - A cubic polynomial f(x) = x³ + x + 1
   - A polynomial g(x) with:
     * g(0) = -1
     * The roots of g are exactly the squares of roots of f

2. We need to find g(9).

3. Ground truth says g(9) = 899
4. Proposed answer says g(9) = 28

Analysis:
- Let α be a root of f (f(α) = 0)
- Then g must have roots at α²
- Since f is cubic, it has either 1 or 3 real roots
- The general form of g should be g(x) = c·(x - α₁²)(x - α₂²)(x - α₃²) where αᵢ are roots of f
- Using g(0) = -1, we can find the constant c
- Then g(9) would be calculated by plugging in x=9

The ground truth answer (899) is correct based on:
1. Calculating the roots of f numerically
2. Constructing g accordingly
3. Evaluating at 9 gives 899

The proposed answer (28) is significantly different and incorrect.
