theorem omnimath268 :
  {n : Fin 14 → ℤ | (∀ i : Fin 14, n i ≥ 0) ∧ (∑ i : Fin 14, (n i)^4) = 1599} = omnimath268_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (Fin 14 → ℤ)
The sum of fourth powers equals 1599, which factors as 3 * 13^3. Given the pattern, the solution likely distributes values across the 14 elements with one or a few elements being 13, and others adjusted accordingly to sum to 1599 with non-negative constraints. Combining these insights, the finite set consists of functions with exactly one element at 13 and the rest zero, to match the sum constraint.
