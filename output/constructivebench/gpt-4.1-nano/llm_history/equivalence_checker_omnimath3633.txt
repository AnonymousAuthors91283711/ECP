Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2 * n + 1) * (n + 1)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (2 * n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of True entries (represented as 1s) in a (2n+1)×(2n+1) Boolean matrix Q under certain constraints on adjacent entries.

2. The ground truth answer is (2n+1)(n+1), which would be:
   - For n=0: 1*1 = 1
   - For n=1: 3*2 = 6
   - For n=2: 5*3 = 15

3. The proposed answer is (2n+1)(2n+1)/2, which would be:
   - For n=0: 1/2 = 0.5 (but must be integer)
   - For n=1: 9/2 = 4.5
   - For n=2: 25/2 = 12.5

The proposed answer:
- Doesn't always yield integer results (invalid for counting matrix entries)
- Doesn't match the ground truth values
- The division by 2 suggests it's trying to count half the matrix, but this doesn't satisfy the adjacency constraints
