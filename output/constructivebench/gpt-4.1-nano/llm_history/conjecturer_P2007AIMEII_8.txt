Given the equation 5h + 4v = 2007, with h,v ≥ 0, and N = (h + 1)(v + 1), we're interested in the maximum N. Since N = (h+1)(v+1), maximizing N is equivalent to balancing h and v given their linear relation. By S-arrangement and bounding, the maximum occurs near h = v, yielded approximately h ≈ 4.11 and v ≈ 4.5, leading to h=4, v=4 as the practical maximum. Therefore, N = 5 * 5 = 25.
