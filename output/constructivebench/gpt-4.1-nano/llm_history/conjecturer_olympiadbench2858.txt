The problem asks for the number of integer solutions for positive x,y satisfying the equation \(x^2 - 8x + y^2 + 4y = 5\). Completing the square:

\[
(x - 4)^2 - 16 + (y + 2)^2 - 4 = 5 \implies (x - 4)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 25
\]

Number of positive solutions occurs where \((x - 4)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 25\) with \(x>0, y>0\). The solutions are lattice points on a circle of radius 5, with the shifted coordinates. The points with positive \(x, y\) are:

\[
(4 \pm 3, -2), (4 \pm 4, -2 \pm 3), (4 \pm 3, 1), (4 \pm 4, 1 \pm 3)
\]

filtered for \(x>0, y>0\). Final count:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]
