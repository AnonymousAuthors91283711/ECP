Ground Truth Answer: 773
Proposed Answer: 201920
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find natural numbers a and b that are coprime, where:
   - 100a + b equals some answer (omnimath2476_answer)
   - a = isosceles/gcd(isosceles,total)
   - b = total/gcd(isosceles,total)
   - isosceles = n(n-1) = 2020*2019
   - total = n(n-1)(n-2)/6 = 2020*2019*2018/6

2. Calculating the values:
   - isosceles = 2020*2019 = 4,078,380
   - total = 2020*2019*2018/6 = 1,370,013,140
   - gcd(4,078,380, 1,370,013,140) = 20,380 (using Euclidean algorithm)

3. Computing a and b:
   - a = 4,078,380/20,380 = 200
   - b = 1,370,013,140/20,380 = 67,223

4. The final answer should be 100a + b = 100*200 + 67,223 = 20,000 + 67,223 = 87,223

The ground truth answer (773) doesn't match our calculation, and neither does the proposed answer (201920). Both appear incorrect based on the mathematical derivation.
