abbrev omnimath2905_answer : â„• := sorry
theorem omnimath2905 :
  (2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 6 = 5 * 6 * omnimath2905_answer * omnimath2905_answer) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 12
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. First, let's compute the left side of the equation:
2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 6 = 4 * 9 * 30 = 36 * 30 = 1080

2. Now let's evaluate both proposed answers with the right side of the equation:

For Ground Truth Answer (6):
5 * 6 * 6 * 6 = 30 * 36 = 1080 (matches left side)

For Proposed Answer (12):
5 * 6 * 12 * 12 = 30 * 144 = 4320 (does not match left side)

The proposed answer of 12 does not satisfy the equation, while the ground truth answer of 6 does. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
