Ground Truth Answer: -2
Proposed Answer: 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a linear function f(x) = a*x + b with two conditions:
   - It's indeed linear (∀ x, f x = a * x + b)
   - It satisfies f(b*x + a) = x for all x

2. From the second condition, we can substitute:
   f(b*x + a) = a*(b*x + a) + b = x
   => a*b*x + a² + b = x

3. For this to hold for all x, we must have:
   - Coefficient of x: a*b = 1
   - Constant term: a² + b = 0

4. Solving the system:
   From a² + b = 0, we get b = -a²
   Substituting into a*b = 1: a*(-a²) = 1 => -a³ = 1 => a³ = -1 => a = -1
   Then b = -(-1)² = -1

5. Therefore a + b = -1 + (-1) = -2

The ground truth answer is -2, which matches our derivation. The proposed answer is 1, which is incorrect.
