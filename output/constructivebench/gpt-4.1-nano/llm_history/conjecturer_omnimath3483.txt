  ∃! (x : ℕ), 2 * (x + 7) - 4 = 28 ∧ x = omnimath3483_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the equation 2*(x+7) - 4 = 28, simplify:
2x + 14 - 4 = 28 ⇒ 2x + 10 = 28 ⇒ 2x = 18 ⇒ x = 9. 
Hence, the unique x satisfying the conditions is 9, and that matches the pattern and enumeration. 

<<<9>>>
