theorem olympiadbench2266 (r : ℝ) :
    (∃ d : ℝ, 4 + d = 4 * r ∧ 4 * r + d = 4 * r^2) ↔ r ∈ olympiadbench2266_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The key equations are: \(4 + d = 4r\) and \(4r + d = 4r^2\). Subtracting the first from the second yields: \(4r - 4 = 4r^2 - 4\), leading to \(d = 4r - 4\), and substituting back gives \(4r + (4r - 4) = 4r^2\), so \(8r - 4 = 4r^2\). Simplify: \(4r^2 - 8r + 4=0\), i.e. \((2r - 1)^2=0\). So, \(r = ½\). The set of such \(r\) is singleton: \(\{ 1/2 \}\).
