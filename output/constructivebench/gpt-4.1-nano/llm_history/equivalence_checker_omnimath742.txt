Ground Truth Answer: 2402
Proposed Answer: 100
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n where √(n+99) - √n < 1.

2. The ground truth answer is 2402. Let's verify this:
   √(2402+99) - √2402 ≈ √2501 - √2402 ≈ 50.01 - 49.02 ≈ 0.99 < 1
   For n=2401: √2500 - √2401 = 50 - 49 = 1 (not less than 1)
   So 2402 is indeed the smallest n satisfying the condition.

3. The proposed answer is 100:
   √(100+99) - √100 = √199 - 10 ≈ 14.107 - 10 = 4.107 > 1
   This clearly doesn't satisfy the inequality.

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the condition at all, let alone being the smallest such number.
