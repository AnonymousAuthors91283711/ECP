The minimal n satisfying the conditions likely corresponds to the smallest number allowing all pairwise coprime sequences after steps, based on pattern recognition and coprimality properties—achieving coprimality after key iterative steps. Since coprimality for pairwise coprime transformations typically requires \( n = 2 \), and to ensure the sequence length stays 100, a small bound is sufficient. The conjectured minimal step count (n) is 2.
