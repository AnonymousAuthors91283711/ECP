Ground Truth Answer: fun m => 2 * (m.primeFactors.card) + 1
Proposed Answer: fun m : ℕ => 2^(m - 1)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n such that for any two integer-valued functions a,b on Fin n, there exists another function x where:
   - At least one x_i is coprime with m
   - Two linear combinations ∑a_i*x_i and ∑b_i*x_i are both ≡0 mod m

2. The ground truth answer suggests this number grows linearly with the number of distinct prime factors of m (2*primeFactors + 1)

3. The proposed answer suggests exponential growth (2^(m-1)), which is fundamentally different behavior

4. For example:
   - If m is prime (1 prime factor), ground truth gives 3, proposed gives 2^(p-1)
   - If m=6 (2 prime factors), ground truth gives 5, proposed gives 32
   - The proposed answer grows much faster and doesn't match the structure of the problem

The answers are clearly not equivalent in behavior or form.
