  IsLeast {s : ℕ | ∃ (f : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)), 
          s = ∑ i, min (f i).val (2 * i.val + 1)} (omnimath55_answer n) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The problem involves permutations of Fin n and summing the minimum of pairwise elements. Based on patterns, the minimal sum aligns with pairing each element with its complement (n-1-i). The sum of min(i, n-1-i) over i=0..n-1 is maximized when pairs are symmetric, leading to a pattern of n^2/4 for even n, and similar for odd n with floor division.
