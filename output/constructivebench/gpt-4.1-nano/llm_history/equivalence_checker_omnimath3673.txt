theorem omnimath3673 (p q : ℕ) :
  p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ p < 2005 ∧ q < 2005 ∧ q ∣ (p^2 + 4) ∧ p ∣ (q^2 + 4) ↔ (p, q) ∈ omnimath3673_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 2), (5, 29), (29, 5)}
Proposed Answer: { (p, p) | p ∈ { p : ℕ | Nat.Prime p ∧ p < 2005 } } ∪ { (3, 7), (7, 3), (13, 13) }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for pairs of prime numbers (p, q) where:
   - Both p and q are primes < 2005
   - q divides p² + 4
   - p divides q² + 4

2. Ground truth answer gives exactly 3 pairs: (2,2), (5,29), (29,5)

3. Proposed answer includes:
   - All pairs where p = q (diagonal pairs)
   - Plus some additional pairs (3,7), (7,3), (13,13)

Analysis:
- (2,2) is missing from proposed answer (2²+4=8, which is divisible by 2)
- (5,29) and (29,5) are missing
- (3,7) is incorrect (3²+4=13, which 7 doesn't divide)
- (7,3) is incorrect (7²+4=53, which 3 doesn't divide)
- (13,13) is correct (13²+4=173, which 13 divides) but wasn't in ground truth

The proposed answer is mostly incorrect, missing correct pairs and including incorrect ones.
