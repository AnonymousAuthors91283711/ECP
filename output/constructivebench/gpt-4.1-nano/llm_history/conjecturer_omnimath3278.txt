Because k n counts the number of 1s in binary representation of 2023×n, and the minimum count for positive n is 1 (occurring when 2023×n is a power of two), the minimal m occurs at the smallest such n. The smallest positive n with 2023×n as a power of 2 is n = 1 if 2023 is a power of 2, otherwise at the minimal n making 2023×n a power of two, which is n=2023 if 2023 is a power of two or else considering multiples of the minimal power of 2 dividing 2023. Since 2023 is not a power of two (prime factorization: 2023=17×119), the minimal n making 2023×n a power of two is n= 2^r / 2023 for minimal r so that 2^r divisible by 2023. The smallest such n is 1 when 2023 divides 2^r, which does not occur since gcd(2023, 2)=1, so minimal is at n=1 with 2023×1. But 2023 is not power of two, so minimal is for n=1 with digits count being at least 1, but unless n makes 2023×n a power of two. The only possibility is when 2023×n is a power of 2, which cannot occur unless 2023 divides 2^r. That does not happen. The smallest positive integer with count 1 is when 2023×n is a power of two at n=1, but no. So the minimal m is 1 at n=1, but since 2023×1 is not a power of 2, the minimal count greater than 0 is when 2023×n equals a power of 2 at minimal n. Therefore, minimal m is 1.

Given these reasoning, the minimal count is 1 for n=1, as 2023 is not a power of 2, and the minimal the count can be.

Answer: The minimal count is 1, occurring at n=1.

Thus, the answer expressed in Lean is:

<<<1>>>
