Ground Truth Answer: 7
Proposed Answer: 16
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem sets up a system of equations based on survey responses:
   - Total children: t + l + a = 31
   - Q1 yes (t + a) = 22
   - Q2 yes (a + l) = 15
   - Q3 yes (t + l) = 9

2. We can solve this system:
   - From t + l = 9 and t + l + a = 31, we get a = 22
   - From a + l = 15 and a = 22, we get l = -7 (which is impossible since l must be a natural number)
   - From t + a = 22 and a = 22, we get t = 0

3. The ground truth answer is 7, but our calculation shows t should be 0 (with inconsistent negative value for l)
4. The proposed answer is 16, which doesn't satisfy any of the equations

The ground truth answer itself seems incorrect based on the given equations, and the proposed answer is completely wrong. However, since we're only asked to compare the answers:

<<<False>>>
