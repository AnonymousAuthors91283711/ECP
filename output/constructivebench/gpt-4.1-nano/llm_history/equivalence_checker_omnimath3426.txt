Ground Truth Answer: fun a => a ^ 2 < a ∧ a < 1 / a
Proposed Answer: fun a : ℝ => ∃ n : ℕ, n > 1 ∧ a = 1 / n
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is asking for a characterization of real numbers 'a' that satisfy both conditions:
1. a² < a
2. a < 1/a

The ground truth answer directly states the conditions as a predicate function.

The proposed answer suggests that these conditions hold exactly when 'a' is of the form 1/n for some integer n > 1.

Let's test this:
1. For a = 1/2 (n=2):
   - (1/2)² = 1/4 < 1/2 ✔
   - 1/2 < 1/(1/2) = 2 ✔

2. For a = 1/3 (n=3):
   - (1/3)² = 1/9 < 1/3 ✔
   - 1/3 < 3 ✔

3. For a = 0.4 (not of form 1/n):
   - 0.16 < 0.4 ✔
   - 0.4 < 2.5 ✔
   This satisfies the conditions but isn't of form 1/n.

The proposed answer is incomplete because there are other numbers (like 0.4) that satisfy the conditions but aren't reciprocals of integers. The ground truth answer correctly captures all such numbers.
