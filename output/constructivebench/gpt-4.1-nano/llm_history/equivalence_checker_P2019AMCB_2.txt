Ground Truth Answer: 27
Proposed Answer: 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a natural number n where:
   - n is not prime
   - n-2 is not prime
   - This number should serve as a counterexample to the statement "for all non-prime n, n-2 is prime"

2. Ground truth answer is 27:
   - 27 is not prime (3×9)
   - 25 (27-2) is not prime (5×5)
   - This correctly satisfies all conditions

3. Proposed answer is 9:
   - 9 is not prime (3×3)
   - 7 (9-2) is prime
   - This fails the second condition that n-2 should not be prime

The proposed answer fails to satisfy all required conditions, while the ground truth answer does. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
