theorem P2021AMCB_7 :
  let N := 34 * 34 * 63 * 270
  let odd_divisors := {d ∈ divisors N | Odd d}
  let even_divisors := {d ∈ divisors N | Even d}
  (∑ d in odd_divisors, d) / (∑ d in even_divisors, d) = P2021AMCB_7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The divisors of N are symmetric in pairs, with each odd divisor d corresponding to N/d, which is even, and vice versa. Summing over all odd and even divisors and taking the ratio simplifies to 1, as pairs cancel out or balance symmetrically.  
Final answer: 
<<<1>>>
