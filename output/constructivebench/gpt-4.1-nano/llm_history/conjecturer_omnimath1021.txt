theorem omnimath1021 :
  Set.ncard {c : (ℤ × ℤ) → (Fin 2) | ∀ a b : ℤ, c (a, b) = c (-1 - b, a + 1) ∧ c (a, b) = c (1 - b, a - 1)} = omnimath1021_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The conditions suggest a symmetry in the functions c, involving transformations with (-1 - b, a + 1) and (1 - b, a - 1). The pattern points toward invariance under these transformations which form a finite orbit. The orbit size through these symmetries appears to be 4, considering the combination of negation and shifts. 

Since only the set of such functions are counted, and each is characterized by a 2×2 pattern repeating or remaining invariant under the transformations, the total count should be 4 (the orbit size). 

Thus, the total number of such functions is 4.
