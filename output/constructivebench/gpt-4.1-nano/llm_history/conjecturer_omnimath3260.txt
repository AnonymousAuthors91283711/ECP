abbrev omnimath3260_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3260 (x : ℝ) : (512 : ℝ)^x = (64 : ℝ)^240 ↔ x = omnimath3260_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the pattern \( (a)^x = (b)^c \Rightarrow x = c \frac{\log b}{\log a} \), and given \( 512 = 2^9, 64 = 2^6 \), we derive \( x = 240 \frac{\log 2^6}{\log 2^9} = 240 \frac{6}{9} = 160 \). 

<<<160>>>
