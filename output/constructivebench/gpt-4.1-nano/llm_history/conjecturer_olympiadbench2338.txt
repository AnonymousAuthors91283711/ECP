The main issue is that the abbreviation `olympiadbench2338_answer` was assigned to the keyword `sorry`, with a verbose comment, which is invalid syntax in Lean. The `abbrev` statement expects a closed-form expression of type `Set ℝ`, but the placeholder comment is not valid. The suggested answer in enumerated answers hints that the solution set is formed by the roots obtained after simplifying the equation.

The original equation:

\[
\frac{x^2 + x + 4}{2x + 1} = \frac{4}{x}
\]

Cross-multiplied:

\[
x (x^2 + x + 4) = (2x + 1) \times 4
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
x^3 + x^2 + 4x = 8x + 4
\]

and rearranged:

\[
x^3 + x^2 + 4x - 8x - 4 = 0 \Rightarrow x^3 + x^2 - 4x - 4 = 0
\]

Factoring out:

\[
x^3 + x^2 - 4x - 4 = (x^2 + 1)(x - 2)
\]

since:

\[
(x^2 + 1)(x - 2) = x^3 - 2x^2 + x - 2
\]

which does **not** match our polynomial. Alternatively, attempt polynomial division or the rational root theorem:

Test possible roots: ±1, ±2, ±4.

- For \(x=1\):

\[
1 + 1 - 4 - 4 = -6 \neq 0
\]

- For \(x=-1\):
  
\[
-1 + 1 + 4 -4 = 0
\]

Thus, \(x=-1\) is a root.

Divide polynomial by \((x+1)\):

\[
x^3 + x^2 - 4x - 4 \div (x+1)
\]

Use synthetic division:

Coefficients: 1 | 1 | -4 | -4

Bring down 1:

- Multiply by root \(-1\):

\[
1, \quad 1 \times -1 = -1
\]
Add to next coefficient:

\[
1 + (-1) = 0
\]
Next:

\[
-4 + 1 \times -1 = -4 - 1 = -5
\]
Next:

\[
-4 + (-1) \times -5 = -4 + 5 = 1
\]

But since it's a degree 3, synthetic division should be:

- Start with 1, 1, -4, -4
- Divide by \(x = -1\):

Perform synthetic division:

Coefficients: 1 | 1 | -4 | -4

Bring down 1:

- Multiply by \(-1\):

\[
1 \times -1 = -1
\]

Add:

\[
1 + (-1) = 0
\]

Next:

\[
-4 + (-1) \times -4 = -4 + 4 = 0
\]

then:

\[
-4 + (-1) \times 0 = -4 + 0 = -4
\]

Remaining, indicating the quotient polynomial is:

\[
x^2 + 0 x + (-4) = x^2 - 4
\]

which factors:

\[
x^2 - 4 = (x-2)(x+2)
\]

Hence, the roots are:

\[
x = -1, \quad x=2, \quad x=-2
\]

Checking for extraneous solutions based on original denominators:

- Denominator \(2x + 1 \neq 0 \Rightarrow x \neq -\frac{1}{2}\)

- \(x \neq 0\) from previous cross-multiplied denominators

All roots are acceptable except \(x=0\) and \(x=-\frac{1}{2}\) (not among roots).

Thus, the solution set:

\[
\{-2, -1, 2\}
\]

in set notation.

In Lean, the set can be written as:

```lean
{ x | x = -2 ∨ x = -1 ∨ x = 2 }
```

**Final code:**

<<<{ x | x = -2 ∨ x = -1 ∨ x = 2 }>>>
