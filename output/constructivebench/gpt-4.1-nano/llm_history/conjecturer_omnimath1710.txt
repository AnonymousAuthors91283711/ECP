The structure resembles finding the number of functions from a 3×3 grid to {0..4} with combined row and column maxima covering the entire range {0..4}. Counting all such functions, the total is 125, as each of the 9 positions independently maps to one of 5 values, satisfying the max conditions. The final count is 125.
