Since we are counting multisets of size 9 from 26 elements with repetition, the count equals the number of combinations with repetition:

Number of multisets of size 9 chosen from 26 elements = (26 + 9 - 1) choose 9 = 34 choose 9.

theorem omnimath2477 : 
  Nat.card {s : Multiset (Fin 26) | Multiset.card s = 9} = omnimath2477_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: binomial 34 9. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 34, which is at "binomial 34 9" in "abbrev omnimath2477_answer : ℕ := binomial 34 9", there is an error: unknown identifier 'binomial'.
. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The error occurs because the function `binomial` is not defined in the current context of Mathlib. In Lean's mathlib, the correct function for binomial coefficients is called `Nat.choose`. To fix the error, replace `binomial 34 9` with `Nat.choose 34 9`. 

The pattern inferred from the enumerated answers, along with the context, suggests that the answer is a binomial coefficient, specifically "34 choose 9". 

Putting it all together, the corrected expression in Lean is simply:

<<<Nat.choose 34 9>>>

This form is explicit, correct, and aligns with the expected answer type ℕ, as `Nat.choose` returns an ℕ.
