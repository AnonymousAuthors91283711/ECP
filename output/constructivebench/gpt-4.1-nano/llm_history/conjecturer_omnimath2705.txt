theorem omnimath2705 : 
  ∀ (x : ℝ), omnimath2705_answer x = 3 * (x - 2) + 5 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
Based on the pattern and the enumerated answer, the expression simplifies linearly with respect to \( x \). The explicit formula appears to be \( 3 (x - 2) + 5 \), which expands to \( 3x - 6 + 5 = 3x - 1 \). 

Thus, the closed-form answer in Lean should be:

<<<fun x : ℝ => 3 * x - 1>>>
