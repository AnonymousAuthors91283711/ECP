Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0, 0)}
Proposed Answer: {(0, 0, 0), (1/2, 1/2, 0), (0, 1/2, 1/2)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a set of real triples (x,y,z) that satisfy two equations:
   - x²y + y²z + z² = 0
   - z³ + z²y + zy³ + x²y = 1/4(x⁴ + y⁴)

2. Ground truth answer claims only (0,0,0) satisfies both equations.

3. Proposed answer suggests three solutions.

Let's test the proposed solutions:

For (0,0,0):
1st equation: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 ✔
2nd equation: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1/4(0 + 0) ✔

For (1/2,1/2,0):
1st equation: (1/4)(1/2) + (1/4)(0) + 0 = 1/8 ≠ 0 ✖
This already fails the first equation.

For (0,1/2,1/2):
1st equation: 0 + (1/4)(1/2) + (1/4) = 0 + 1/8 + 1/4 = 3/8 ≠ 0 ✖
Also fails the first equation.

Only (0,0,0) satisfies both equations. The other proposed solutions don't satisfy the first equation.
