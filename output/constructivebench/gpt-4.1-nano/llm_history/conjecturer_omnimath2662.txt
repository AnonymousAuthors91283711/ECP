theorem omnimath2662 : 
  ∃ (p q r : ℝ), (p * q) * (q * r) * (r * p) = 16 ∧ p * q * r = omnimath2662_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on pattern, the answer involves the symmetric product leading to \(16\), and the value \(p q r\) being related to the cube, which suggests a constant multiple of 2. Since the relation is symmetric and involves cube roots, the minimal consistent value appears to be \( \boxed{2} \).
