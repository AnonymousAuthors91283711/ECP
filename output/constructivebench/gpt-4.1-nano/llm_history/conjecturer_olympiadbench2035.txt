The dominant term depends on the symmetry and the structure of the sum, and the maximum occurs when each term balances the others. Given constraints and symmetry, the expression is maximized when all variables are equal, i.e., a = b = c = d = 25. Substituting gives each term as (25 / (25+7))^(1/3) = (25/32)^(1/3). Summing four identical terms yields 4 * (25/32)^(1/3).

The main issue in the current proposed answer is that it tries to describe the reasoning in natural language directly in the definition, which is invalid in Lean. We need a closed-form expression, not a sentence, for the maximum value. From the symmetry and the structure of the sum, the maximum is achieved when all variables are equal, i.e., \(a = b = c = d = 25\). Given that, each term evaluates to \((25 / (25 + 7))^{1/3}\), which simplifies to \((25/32)^{1/3}\). The sum of all four terms then is \(4 \times (25/32)^{1/3}\). This is a concise, valid, and closed-form answer in Lean syntax.
