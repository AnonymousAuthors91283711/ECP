The pattern suggests a prime p of the form 3*10^{2+k} + 8*10^{1+k} + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 10^{i} for k ≥ 1, which simplifies geometrically to p = 3 * 10^{k+2} + 8 * 10^{k+1} + (10^{k} - 1)/9. The form combines these into p = 10^{k+1} * (3*10 + 8) + (10^{k} - 1)/9, i.e., p = 10^{k+1} * 38 + (10^{k} - 1)/9. Simplifying, the core pattern is p=38*10^{k+1} + (10^{k} - 1)/9.

Final answer:
<<<∃ k ≥ 1, p = 38 * 10^(k + 1) + (10^k - 1) / 9>>>

This captures the pattern for such p.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The primary issue in your proposed answer is the use of 'p' directly in the definition of 'omnimath3588_answer' without specifying it as a parameter or in the context. Since 'p' is existentially quantified in the theorem statement, it should be included explicitly in the answer statement as well. Otherwise, Lean cannot resolve 'p', leading to the unknown identifier error. 

The target expression appears to match the sum:  
p = 3 * 10^(2 + k) + 8 * 10^(1 + k) + ∑_{i=0}^{k-1} 10^i

Calculating the sum:  
∑_{i=0}^{k-1} 10^i = (10^k - 1)/9

Rewrite the sum expression to a closed form:  
p = 3*10^{k + 2} + 8*10^{k + 1} + (10^k - 1)/9

Factor the powers of 10:  
p = 10^{k+1} * (3*10 + 8) + (10^k - 1)/9  
= 10^{k+1} * 38 + (10^k - 1)/9

This yields precisely:  
p = 38 * 10^{k+1} + (10^k - 1)/9

In Lean, code construction requires that the existential quantifier before 'p' be explicitly incorporated into the answer expression, as a sigma over k and p with the specified property, or better, a property involving p 's defining relation. However, since the original question seeks an expression for 'p' as a function of 'k', the most straightforward way is to say that for each k ≥ 1, p equals that formula, with the fulfillment of the conditions that p is prime and the original sum condition.

But the current problem asks for 'omnimath3588_answer' as a Prop, that is, a statement containing the expression, not a function. Therefore, the correct precise form would be:

<<<∃ k ≥ 1, p = 38 * 10^(k + 1) + (10^k - 1)/9>>>

But to relate 'p' properly, I'll exclude 'p' from the definition of 'omnimath3588_answer' and associate 'p' explicitly with the expression in the statement of the theorem.

Thus, the answer I propose, following the pattern, is:

"∃ k ≥ 1, p = 38 * 10^(k + 1) + (10^k - 1)/9"

which is the formula derived from the sum.

Final corrected code snippet:

<<<∃ k ≥ 1, p = 38 * 10^(k + 1) + (10^k - 1)/9>>>

This expression correctly captures the closed-form relation between 'p' and 'k', aligning with the sum representation and the pattern in enumerated answers, and respects the logical structure, assuming 'p' is appropriately introduced or understood in the context.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The main issue in the proposed answer is that the variable `p` is used outside of a quantifier, causing an undefined identifier error. To fix this, `p` must be included within an existential quantifier, such as `∃ p : ℕ`, to properly scope it.

Given the structure of the original problem, where the formula involves a prime number `p` related to powers of 10, and considering the pattern in the enumerated answers, the intended proposition is that `p` can be expressed in a closed form depending on `k`. The sum involving `∑ i in Finset.range k, 10^i` simplifies to `(10^k - 1) / 9`, as it's a geometric series.

Therefore, the correct formal statement in Lean should be:
```lean
∃ p : ℕ, p.Prime ∧ ∃ k ≥ 1, p = 38 * 10^(k + 1) + (10^k - 1)/9
```
This encapsulates that there exists a prime `p` satisfying the relation for some `k ≥ 1`. The variable `p` is properly introduced within the existential quantifier, matching Lean syntax and avoiding unknown identifier errors.
