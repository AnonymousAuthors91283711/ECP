The conditions reduce to the positive arguments of logs, i.e., \(5x+9>0\) and \(x+3>0\), with the logs' sum simplifying to a power relation. The key is the equality of the sum of logs to 4, equating to the ratio of the bases raised to the 4th power. Combining conditions yields the unique solution \(x=1\).
