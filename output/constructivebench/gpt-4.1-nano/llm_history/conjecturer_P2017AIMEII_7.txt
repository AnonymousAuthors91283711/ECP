The key equation is log(k * x) = 2 * log(x + 2), which implies k * x = (x + 2)^2. For x > 0, this leads to k = (x + 2)^2 / x. Expressing x in terms of k yields a quadratic form that simplifies as k varies over acceptable integer values. The set of k satisfying the bounds corresponds to k = a^2 + 4a, with a ∈ ℤ, and these fall within the interval [-500, 500]. The quadratic form a^2 + 4a covers integers from -500 to 500, totaling 1001. 

Final answer:
<<<(500) + 1>>>
