The pattern in enumerated answers suggests the pairs (a, b) satisfy a quadratic relation stemming from the binomial sums. Based on symmetry and polynomial coefficients, the set characterizes conditions where the quadratic factors produce combinations involving \((-1)^i\). The pattern indicates (a,b) are all integers with specific relations to powers of 2 and signs, specifically forming the set where \( a^2 = 4b \) or similar quadratic relations. Since the enumerated pattern covers these, the closed form is:

<<<{(a, b) | a^2 = 4 * b}>>>
