The problem describes a set involving finite subsets with specific properties constrained by size and filtering. Based on pattern analysis and the constraints, the maximal size of such a set occurs with the largest possible subset⊆ range 43 satisfying the filtering condition. Since the property ensures elements are sufficiently large relative to subset sizes, the answer is approximately half of 42, scaled appropriately.
