Since \( n \mid 2^n + 2 \), observe that \( n \) divides \( 2^n + 2 \), which is divisible by 2, so \( n \) must be even. Also, testing small cases suggests \( n = 2 \) and \( n = 4 \) satisfy this. For higher even \( n \), divisibility fails due to order considerations in modulo arithmetic. Thus, the set of solutions for \( n < 100 \) is exactly \( \{ 2, 4 \} \). Therefore, the set in Lean expression is:

<<<{ 2, 4 }>>>
