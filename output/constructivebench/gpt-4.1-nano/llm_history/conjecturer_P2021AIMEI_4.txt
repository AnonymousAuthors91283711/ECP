The pattern and constraints suggest the answer counts the number of triplets with a fixed sum 66 and an increasing order a<b<c, with all positive. Ignoring the lower bounds slightly, the total number of ordered triplets (a,b,c) with a+b+c=66 is related to partitions, but the strict inequalities a<b<c imply a set of increasing triplets with fixed sum. Using combinatorics for strictly increasing sequences, the count corresponds to choosing 3 distinct positive integers summing to 66, which matches binomial coefficients for partitions.

Since the number of strictly increasing triples (a,b,c) with a+b+c=66 and a,b,c > 0 is the same as choosing 3 distinct positive integers summing to 66, and the list of enumerated answers indicates the count follows a known pattern, the count is given by how many ways to select 3 increasing numbers summing to 66.

The distribution over positive integers with a<b<c and sum 66 corresponds to choosing 3 increasing numbers from 1 to 64 (since maximum of c must be less than 66), summing to 66, which results in 276.

Thus, the answer is 276.

<<<66 * 65 * 64 / 6>>>
