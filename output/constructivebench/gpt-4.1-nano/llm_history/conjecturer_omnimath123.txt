abbrev omnimath123_answer : Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath123 :
  (∃ k > 0, let p := 6 * k + 1; Nat.Prime p ∧ (Nat.choose (3 * k) k) ≡ 1 [MOD p]) ↔ omnimath123_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Prop
The pattern suggests the property holds for all positive integers k, where p=6k+1 is prime and binomial coefficient ≡ 1 mod p; thus, the answer is the conjunction of such properties for all k > 0. The universal form captures the logical structure, eliminating the existential quantifier. 

<<<∀ k > 0, (Nat.Prime (6 * k + 1) ∧ Nat.choose (3 * k) k ≡ 1 [MOD (6 * k + 1)])>>>
