  P2006AMCB_6_answer = (25 + 386) * 200 / (100 + 100 + 400) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern of numerator (25 + 386) and denominator (100 + 100 + 400), the general form simplifies to a ratio involving constants, which in this case evaluates to (411 * 200) / 600. Calculating, 411 * 200 / 600 simplifies to 137. Thus, the explicit closed-form answer is:

<<<(25 + 386) * 200 / (100 + 100 + 400)>>>

which simplifies to 137.
