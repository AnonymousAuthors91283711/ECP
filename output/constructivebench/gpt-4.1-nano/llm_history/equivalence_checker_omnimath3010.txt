theorem omnimath3010
(x : ℤ)
(hx : 4 * x + 14 = 8 * x - 48)
: 2 * x = omnimath3010_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 31
Proposed Answer: -17
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation given is: 4x + 14 = 8x - 48
2. Solving step by step:
   - Subtract 4x from both sides: 14 = 4x - 48
   - Add 48 to both sides: 62 = 4x
   - Divide by 4: x = 15.5
3. The problem asks for 2x:
   - 2x = 2 * 15.5 = 31

The ground truth answer is 31, which matches our calculation.
The proposed answer is -17, which is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
