: a / b = omnimath2793_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the equation (a + b) / (a - b) = 3, solving for a/b yields a/b = 2. This comes from the algebraic manipulation: a + b = 3(a - b) ⇒ a + b = 3a - 3b ⇒ 4b = 2a ⇒ a/b = 2. 

Thus, the closed-form answer is 2.
