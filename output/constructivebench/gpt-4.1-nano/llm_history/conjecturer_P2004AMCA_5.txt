Given the property -1 < m * b < 0, the only possible values for m * b lie in the interval (-1, 0). Since the question is about a relation, the natural description is "the product m * b is between -1 and 0." So, the answer describes the set of all pairs where m * b is in that interval. Using the provided equivalence, the most direct formalization is: 

<<<fun m b : ℝ => -1 < m * b ∧ m * b < 0>>>
