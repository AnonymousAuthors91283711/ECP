The problem counts permutations of 6 elements where certain sums mod 3 over consecutive triples are non-zero. The pattern suggests the answer relates to arrangements avoiding specific consecutive sum conditions, likely proportional to powers of 2. For the 4-term pattern and 6 elements, the count appears to be 16, following the enumeration.
