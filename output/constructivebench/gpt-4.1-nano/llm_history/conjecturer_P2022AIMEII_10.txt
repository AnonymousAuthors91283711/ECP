The pattern in enumerated answers suggests a focus on the composite sum's modular behavior and binomial coefficients structure. Since the sum involves nested binomial coefficients, and the pattern of answers indicates a focus on small modular patterns, the conjecture is that the sum simplifies to a linear expression in terms of \( i \) or a known combinatorial identity reducing the sum mod 1000 to a simple value. Given the common approach in such problems, a natural candidate is a constant or a simple polynomial expression mod 1000. Based on the enumeration, the answer aligns with a constant derived from the sum's symmetry or known sum identities.
