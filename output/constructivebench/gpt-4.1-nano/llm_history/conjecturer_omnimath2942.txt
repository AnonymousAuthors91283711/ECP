theorem omnimath2942 : 
  ∃ (k : ℕ), 3 + 11 * k = omnimath2942_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern from the enumeration suggests a linear relation of the form 3 + 11 * k. Since the target is to find an explicit ℕ answer, and the enumeration provides a candidate sequence, the simplest closed-form that fits the pattern and aligns with the theorem is:

theorem omnimath2942 : 
  ∃ (k : ℕ), 3 + 11 * k = omnimath2942_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: The pattern from the enumeration suggests a linear relation of the form 3 + 11 * k. Since the target is to find an explicit ℕ answer, and the enumeration provides a candidate sequence, the simplest closed-form that fits the pattern and aligns with the theorem is:

You should only include the content of proposed answer, and you should not include theorem headers like theorem <theorem_name> : <type> := beyond the answer part.. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern indicates that the answer is of the form 3 + 11 * k, where k is a non-negative integer. Since the theorem asserts the existence of such a k satisfying the equation, the simplest explicit value that satisfies the equation for some non-negative k is when k = 0, giving the value 3. This aligns with the pattern and provides a concrete example.

Therefore, the fixed and compile-able answer should be:

<<<3>>>
