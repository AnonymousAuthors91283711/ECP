theorem P2010AMCA_15 (p : ℝ) (hp : 0 < p ∧ p < 1/2) :
  (Nat.choose 4 2) * p^2 * (1 - p)^2 = 1/6 ↔ p = P2010AMCA_15_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Since (Nat.choose 4 2) = 6 and the equation is 6 * p^2 * (1 - p)^2 = 1/6, solving yields p^2 * (1 - p)^2 = 1/36. The roots are p = 1/3 or p = 2/3; given 0 < p < 1/2, the solution is p = 1/3. 

<<<1/3>>>
