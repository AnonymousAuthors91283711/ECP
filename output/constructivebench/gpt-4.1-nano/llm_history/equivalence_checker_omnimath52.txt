Ground Truth Answer: { (a, n) | n = 1 ∧ a > 0 }
Proposed Answer: { (a,1) | a > 0 }
<<<True>>>
The ground truth answer states that the condition is satisfied when n = 1 and a > 0. The proposed answer states the same condition but written in a different form: it specifies all pairs where the second element is 1 (n=1) and the first element is positive (a > 0). Both answers are mathematically equivalent, just expressed differently. The ground truth uses a conjunction (n = 1 ∧ a > 0) while the proposed answer uses set builder notation focusing on the n=1 case.
