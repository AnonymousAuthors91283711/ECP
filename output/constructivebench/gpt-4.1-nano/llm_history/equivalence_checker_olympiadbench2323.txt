theorem olympiadbench2323 :
  {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (n ^ 2 + n + 15) % n = 0} = olympiadbench2323_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {1, 3, 5, 15}
Proposed Answer: { n | n ∣ 15 }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer { n | n ∣ 15 } (all divisors of 15) is mostly correct but includes 0 as a divisor of 15, while the ground truth explicitly excludes 0 (0 < n condition). The correct divisors of 15 greater than 0 are exactly {1, 3, 5, 15}. So the proposed answer is correct in spirit but technically incorrect due to the inclusion of 0.
