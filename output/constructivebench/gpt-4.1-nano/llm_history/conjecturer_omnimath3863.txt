The problem asks for the maximum size n such that there exists an injective function with the described attacking pattern. The pattern resembles an 8x8 grid with attack restrictions similar to chess rooks, limiting attacks per row and column. The maximal n is 8, the grid size, since beyond 8, injective placement becomes impossible to meet the attacking constraints.
