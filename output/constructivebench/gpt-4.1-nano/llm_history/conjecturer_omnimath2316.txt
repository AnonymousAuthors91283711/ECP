theorem omnimath2316 :
  {(a, b, c) : ℤ × ℤ × ℤ | 1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 100 ∧ 1 ≤ b ∧ b ≤ 100 ∧ 1 ≤ c ∧ c ≤ 100 ∧ a ^ 2 * b + b ^ 2 * c + c ^ 2 * a = a * b ^ 2 + b * c ^ 2 + c * a ^ 2}.ncard = omnimath2316_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given symmetry and the structure of the equation, likely solutions are when the variables are equal: a = b = c. Substituting into the expression confirms the equation holds. Hence, the number of solutions is the number of such triples with a in 1..100. 

Therefore, omnimath2316_answer is 100.

<<<100>>>
