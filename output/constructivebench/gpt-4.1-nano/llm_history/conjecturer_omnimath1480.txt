Given that the number of divisors of \( n^2 \) relates to the number of divisors of \( n \), and considering the pattern observed in enumerated answers, the ratio in the second divisor count for \( n^7 \) seems to scale in a predictable polynomial manner with respect to the divisors of \( n \). The consistent pattern suggests the function corresponds to \( n^6 \cdot 7 \). So the ratio should be \( 7 \).
