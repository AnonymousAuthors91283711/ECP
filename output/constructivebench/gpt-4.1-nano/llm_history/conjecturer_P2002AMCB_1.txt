theorem P2002AMCB_1 :
  let numbers := List.range 9 |>.map fun n => 10^(n + 1) - 1
  let M := numbers.sum / 9
  (List.length (digits 10 M) = 9) ∧
  (∀ d ∈ digits 10 M, (digits 10 M).count d = 1) ∧
  ¬(P2002AMCB_1_answer ∈ digits 10 M) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests M is a 9-digit number with all digits 1 through 9 exactly once, i.e., the 9-digit repunit sum divided by 9, which results in 123456789. Thus, the answer most fittingly is 123456789, the number with all digits 1..9 exactly once.

<<<123456789>>>
