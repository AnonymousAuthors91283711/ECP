The pattern suggests summing powers with decreasing exponents and increasing bases. Since it sums from 1 to 25, a closed-form involves the sum of binomial coefficients and powers, but the enumerated answers hint at a simple polynomial-like pattern. The final answer is the total sum, which evaluates to 2^25 - 25, following the conjectures and pattern deductions. 

<<<2^25 - 25>>>
