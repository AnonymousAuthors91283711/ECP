Ground Truth Answer: {0, 1, (1 + sqrt 5)/2, (1 - sqrt 5)/2}
Proposed Answer: { r : ℝ | ∃ x : ℝ, r * r - x * r - 1 = 0 }
Let's analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

The ground truth answer explicitly lists four specific real numbers: 0, 1, (1 + sqrt 5)/2, and (1 - sqrt 5)/2.

The proposed answer defines a set through a condition: all real numbers r such that there exists some x where r² - x·r - 1 = 0. This is equivalent to saying r² - 1 = x·r for some x, which is always true for any non-zero r (just take x = (r² - 1)/r). For r=0, the equation becomes -1=0, which is false. Therefore, the proposed answer is actually ℝ\{0}.

This is not equivalent to the ground truth answer, which is a finite set of four specific numbers. The proposed answer includes all real numbers except 0, while the ground truth is a very specific subset.
