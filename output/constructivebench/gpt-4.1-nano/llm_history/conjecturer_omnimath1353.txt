The symmetry condition (p ∘ q).eval x = (q ∘ p).eval x for all x suggests p and q have specific related forms. Given the degrees and evaluations at 0, the symmetry implies p and q are affine transformations with specific coefficients. The pattern indicates p and q are linear functions with particular constant terms satisfying the evaluation constraints and the symmetry condition. Based on the enumeration and pattern, the natural closed-form answer involves linear functions that satisfy the degree, evaluation, and symmetry constraints at 0 and 3, 6 respectively.

The current proposed answer:
```lean
(-24 + 30) , (-24 + 30)
```
results in a syntax error because, in Lean, defining a tuple requires parentheses or braces, and the comma must be within the parentheses unless explicitly using tuple notation.

The correct way to express a pair (tuple) in Lean is:
```lean
( expr1 , expr2 )
```
enclosed within parentheses.

Given that the answer is supposed to be a pair of real numbers, the corrected answer should be:
```lean
( (-24 + 30), (-24 + 30) )
```

Additionally, based on the problem's symmetry and the constraints involving the degrees and evaluations, the conjectured answer for `(p.eval 3, q.eval 6)` under the equal composition condition suggests that the evaluations at these points are equal and align with the sums of these constants.

Therefore, the corrected expression is:
```lean
<<< ( (-24 + 30), (-24 + 30) ) >>>
