theorem omnimath3345 (x : ℝ) (hx : x ≠ 0) :
  ∏ m ∈ Finset.range 100, ∏ n ∈ Finset.range 100, 
    (x^(n+m) + x^(n+m+2) + x^(2*n+1) + x^(2*m+1)) / 
    (x^(2*n) + 2*x^(n+m) + x^(2*m)) = omnimath3345_answer x := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
The pattern suggests the expression simplifies to a rational function involving powers of x, with dominant behavior resembling x^m for large m, and symmetry in n and m. From the pattern and symmetry, the form likely simplifies to an expression proportional to 1/x^2, considering the dominant powers cancel out systematically. The enumerated answers suggest a simple inverse quadratic form.
