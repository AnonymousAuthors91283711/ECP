noncomputable abbrev omnimath2803_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2803
(a b : ℝ)
(hab : a = (2 / 3) * b ∧ b ≠ 0)
: (9 * a + 8 * b) / (6 * a) = omnimath2803_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Since a = (2/3) * b, substitute into (9a + 8b)/(6a):
= (9 * (2/3) * b + 8b)/(6 * (2/3) * b) simplifies to (6b + 8b) / (4b) = 14b / 4b = 14/4 = 7/2. 

Final answer: <<<7/2>>>
