The pattern suggests solutions where \(2^x \times 3^y = 5^z \times 7^w + 1\). The simple solutions occur when \(z = w = 0\), giving \(2^x \times 3^y = 2\), i.e., \((x,y,z,w) = (1,0,0,0)\), and also the case where \(x=0, y=1\), yielding \((0,1,0,0)\). No other solutions seem feasible because higher powers quickly diverge. Therefore, the answer set contains precisely these two solutions.
