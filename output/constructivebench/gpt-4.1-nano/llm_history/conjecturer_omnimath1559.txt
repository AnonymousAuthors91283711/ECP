abbrev omnimath1559_answer : Set ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath1559 :
  {c : ℤ | ∃ a b : ℤ, a + b * c = 2017 ∧ b + c * a = 8} = omnimath1559_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℤ
The equations a + b c = 2017 and b + c a = 8 imply system relationships solvable via elimination. The pattern suggests fixing c, then solving for a, b. For c, the solutions form a set with form involving integer divisors; the solutions' set simplifies to c = 2 or c = - 1. For these, a and b are linearly dependent and finite; they encompass all such (a, b) for these c. Therefore, the explicit set includes all integer solutions arising from c ∈ {2, -1}.
