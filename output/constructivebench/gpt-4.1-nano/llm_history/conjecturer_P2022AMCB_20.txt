The pattern indicates a polynomial P satisfying remainders mod quadratics with consistent residues. The answer likely sums the squares of coefficients of a polynomial matching those remainders, leading to a fixed value upon solving the system. 

Conjecture based on patterns: \( 14 \). 

Thus, the answer is: <<<14>>>
