theorem P2024HMMTnov_team_4 :
  ∑ n in (Finset.range 111).map (Function.Embedding.mk (fun k => 9 * (k + 1)) (by simp [Function.Injective])),
    (digits 10 n).sum = P2024HMMTnov_team_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests summing 9 times the numbers from 1 to 111, and summing their digits. This results in the sum of the individual digits from 9 to 999, which can be simplified.

Hence, the total digit sum over 9, 18, ..., 999 is:

Sum of digits of numbers from 9 to 999, where each digit place contributes equally over the ranges.

By analyzing the pattern, the total digit sum is:

\[ 4050 \]
because sum of digits from 1 to 999 appears as \( 9 \times \frac{999 \times 1000}{2} / 9 = 4050 \).

Thus,

<<<4050>>>
