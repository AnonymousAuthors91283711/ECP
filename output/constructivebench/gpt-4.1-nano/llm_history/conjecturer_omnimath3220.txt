Since the sum of digits of 25 * N is maximized when N is as large as possible within the range, the answer should be the maximum sum of digits for N = 10,000,000. The pattern suggests that for N near the upper bound, 25 * N is close to 250,000,000, whose digit sum is 2+5+0+0+0+0+0+0+0 = 8. To maximize the sum, the last digits should be 9, i.e., N near 10,000,000, leading to 25 * 10,000,000 = 250,000,000, with digit sum = 2+5+0+0+0+0+0+0+0 = 7. But better maximization occurs at N such that 25 * N yields digits summing to 25.

Considering the pattern and maximization, the most plausible sum is 25 when N is approximately close to the upper limit, i.e., 10,000,000. Therefore, the maximum digit sum is 25.
