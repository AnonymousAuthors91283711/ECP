  (P : ℝ)
  (x : ℝ)
  (hx : 0 ≤ x ∧ x ≤ 100)

  round x = P2009AMCB_7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem involves solving the equation involving P and x under the given constraints. Simplifying the equation shows that x must be zero to satisfy the equality because the multiplicative factors involving x cancel only when x = 0. Based on the pattern of the enumerated answers, the constant solution is 0.
