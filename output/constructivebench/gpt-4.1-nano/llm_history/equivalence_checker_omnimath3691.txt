Ground Truth Answer: X + 1
Proposed Answer: X^2 - 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a polynomial P ∈ ℤ[X] where:
   - P(0) ≠ 0
   - For all natural numbers n,m, there exists an integer k such that P(n)^m * P(m)^n is a perfect square

2. Ground Truth Answer: X + 1
   - P(0) = 1 ≠ 0
   - P(n)^m * P(m)^n = (n+1)^m * (m+1)^n = [(n+1)^(m/2) * (m+1)^(n/2)]^2 when m,n are even
   - For odd exponents, we might not get perfect squares (e.g., n=1,m=1 gives 4 which is square, but n=1,m=2 gives 9*4=36 which is square)

3. Proposed Answer: X^2 - 1
   - P(0) = -1 ≠ 0
   - P(n)^m * P(m)^n = (n²-1)^m * (m²-1)^n
   - This doesn't always yield perfect squares (e.g., n=2,m=3 gives 3^3 * 8^2 = 27*64 = 1728 which is not a perfect square)

The proposed answer fails the second condition, while the ground truth answer satisfies both conditions. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
