theorem omnimath383 : 
  (1 / 9 : ℚ) * 60 = 5 ∧ (1 / 20 : ℚ) * 80 = omnimath383_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The second part calculates (1/20) * 80 = 4. The first part confirms (1/9)*60 = 60/9 = 20/3, but given the pattern, the answer should be 4. Therefore, the final answer is 4.
