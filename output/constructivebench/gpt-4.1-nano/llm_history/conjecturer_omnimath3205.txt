  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∀ f : Fin n → Fin 2, ∃ s : Finset (Fin n), s.card = 3 ∧ ∀ x ∈ s, ∀ y ∈ s, f x = f y} omnimath3205_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the smallest n where any coloring of n elements yields a 3-element subset with identical coloring. This corresponds to the Ramsey number R(2,3)=6, where any coloring ensures a monochromatic triangle. Hence, the answer is 6.
