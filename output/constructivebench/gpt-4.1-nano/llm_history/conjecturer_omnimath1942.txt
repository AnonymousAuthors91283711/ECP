Based on the pattern of enumerated answers, the maximum value for the count of such quadruples with parity condition appears to be 20 for a 5×5 grid, considering the structure and symmetry constraints. Given that the count depends on combinatorial arrangements satisfying the odd sum condition, the maximum is reached when the parity placements are maximized.
