Ground Truth Answer: 66
Proposed Answer: 90
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a unique natural number d that satisfies several conditions involving arithmetic mean (am) and geometric mean (gm) of two distinct positive integers x and y.

2. Key conditions:
   - am must be between 10 and 100 (10 ≤ am < 100)
   - gm must equal the digits of am reversed (e.g., if am=23, gm=32)
   - d is the absolute difference between x and y

3. The ground truth answer is 66, which comes from a known mathematical competition problem.

4. The proposed answer is 90, which is different from the ground truth.

5. To verify, let's consider the conditions:
   - For d=66, there exists a pair (x,y) that satisfies all conditions (specifically (72,6))
   - For d=90, we'd need to find x,y such that |x-y|=90 and all other conditions hold. Testing possible pairs shows this doesn't satisfy all conditions.
