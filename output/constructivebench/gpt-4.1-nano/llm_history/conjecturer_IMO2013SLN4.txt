The pattern suggests that for large k, the digit sum condition relates to perfect squares formed from a digit list. Since the problem constrains digits between 1 and 9 and involves digit sums in reverse order, the core truth is that for large n, the number of such representations stabilizes or is empty. The answer is a proposition stating that such a configuration is impossible for all sufficiently large k. 

Thus, the implied final answer is that no such sequence exists.
