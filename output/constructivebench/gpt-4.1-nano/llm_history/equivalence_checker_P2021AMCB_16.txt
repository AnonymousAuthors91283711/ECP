theorem P2021AMCB_16 (a b c : ℚ) (h : 1 < a ∧ a < b ∧ b < c) :
  (∀ (f : ℚ[X]), f = X^3 + C a * X^2 + C b * X + C c →

Ground Truth Answer: fun a b c => (1 + a + b + c) / c
Proposed Answer: fun a b c => 1 / (a * b * c)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a rational function P2021AMCB_16_answer that satisfies certain conditions about polynomial roots and their reciprocals.

2. The ground truth answer is (1 + a + b + c)/c, which is a linear expression in terms of the coefficients.

3. The proposed answer is 1/(a*b*c), which is a completely different rational expression.

Key observations:
- The ground truth answer involves the sum of all coefficients plus 1, divided by c.
- The proposed answer is the reciprocal of the product of all coefficients.
- These two expressions are fundamentally different in form and meaning.
- There's no obvious transformation that would make them equivalent.
- The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the condition g.eval 1 = P2021AMCB_16_answer a b c when compared to the ground truth.
