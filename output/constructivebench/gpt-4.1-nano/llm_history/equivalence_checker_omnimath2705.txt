abbrev omnimath2705_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2705 : 
  ∀ (x : ℝ), omnimath2705_answer x = 3 * (x - 2) + 5 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 3 * x - 1
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℝ => 3 * x - 1
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem defines a function `omnimath2705_answer` and states it should equal `3 * (x - 2) + 5` for all real x.

2. The ground truth answer simplifies the expression:
   `3 * (x - 2) + 5 = 3x - 6 + 5 = 3x - 1`

3. The proposed answer is exactly `fun x : ℝ => 3 * x - 1`, which matches the simplified form.

The two answers are identical in both form and meaning. The type annotation `: ℝ` in the proposed answer doesn't affect the equivalence as it's already implied in the ground truth.
