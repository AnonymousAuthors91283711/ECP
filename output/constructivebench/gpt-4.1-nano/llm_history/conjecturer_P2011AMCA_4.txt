abbrev P2011AMCA_4_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2011AMCA_4 :
  let third := 4
  let fourth := 2
  let fifth := 1
  (third * 12 + fourth * 15 + fifth * 10) / (third + fourth + fifth) = P2011AMCA_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The numerator is (4 * 12 + 2 * 15 + 1 * 10) = (48 + 30 + 10) = 88; the denominator is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7; thus, the average is 88/7. So, the answer should be 88/7 in ℚ form. 

<<<88/7>>>
