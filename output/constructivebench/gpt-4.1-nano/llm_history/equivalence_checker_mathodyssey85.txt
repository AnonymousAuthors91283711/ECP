Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal value of a² + b² under certain geometric constraints involving distances from points to a circle.

2. The ground truth answer is 1, which suggests that the minimal sum of squares occurs when a² + b² = 1.

3. The proposed answer is 4, which is significantly larger than the ground truth.

4. The problem involves finding the least value of a² + b² where the maximum distance from (-a, -b) to points on the circle centered at (0,4) with radius 1 is 6. The correct minimal sum of squares should indeed be 1, achieved when (a,b) is at distance 1 from the origin.

The proposed answer of 4 is incorrect as it doesn't match the ground truth and doesn't satisfy the problem's conditions.
