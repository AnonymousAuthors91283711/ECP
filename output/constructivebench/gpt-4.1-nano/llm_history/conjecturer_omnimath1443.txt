The pattern suggests that the operation op resembles multiplication, with properties reflecting its behavior over positive elements. Given the base case op 1 1 = 1, and properties involving multiplication, the operation seems to reduce to a form involving ratios, specifically op x y = x^{1 - y} when x, y > 0. For x = 19, y = 98, this yields 19^{1 - 98} = 19^{-97}.

Hence, the closed-form expression is 19^{1 - 98}.
