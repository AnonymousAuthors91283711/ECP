Since the equality involves multiple cosine powers and identities, the solutions typically occur at angles where cosine values are specific roots—likely where cosine is ±1/2 or related special angles. Based on the formula and common solution patterns, the sum of these solutions is likely to be a multiple of 180°, i.e., an integer multiple of π, scaled accordingly. Given the symmetry and the specific form, the sum of solutions is probably 180.
