  (IMO2012SLC2_answer n) := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: n. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 37, which is at "n" in "abbrev IMO2012SLC2_answer : ℕ → ℕ := n", there is an error: unknown identifier 'n'.

The error occurs because in the abbreviation definition, `abbrev IMO2012SLC2_answer : ℕ → ℕ := n`, the variable `n` is used on the right side without being an expression dependent on the input `n`. For a function from ℕ to ℕ, the right side must be a function of its input argument.

From the pattern of the given enumerated answers and typical solutions for such extremal combinatorics problems (e.g., maximum size of a set of pairs with certain restrictions), the answer likely depends linearly on `n`.

Analyzing the pattern, and guessing from the symmetry and common forms of such extremal constructions, a plausible closed-form answer would be `n` itself. The maximum size of such a set, in the worst case, could be proportional to `n`.

To correct the code, I will define:

```lean
abbrev IMO2012SLC2_answer : ℕ → ℕ := fun n => n
```

This supplies a lambda function with input `n`, returning `n`, which matches the expected pattern and compiles correctly.

**Final answer:**

<<<fun n : ℕ => n>>>
