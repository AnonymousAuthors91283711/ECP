Given the problem's structure, the minimal number of planes needed to cover all integer points in an n×n×n cube without passing through the origin is n+1, based on the pattern in enumerated solutions. The minimal set often involves n planes aligned with each coordinate axis plus an additional plane to handle the interior points.
