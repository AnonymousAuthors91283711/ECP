Given T=13, the quadratic is x^2 - 13x - n = 0. The solutions are x = (13 ± √(169 + 4n))/2. For x to be integer, 169+4n must be a perfect square, say k^2. Since n > 2023, n = (k^2 - 169)/4 > 2023, so k^2 > 4*2023 + 169 = 8089+169=8258, i.e., k ≥ 91. The minimal perfect square ≥ 8260 is 92^2=8464. Then n = (8464-169)/4=8295/4=2073.75, not integer. Next k=93 → 93^2=8649 → n=(8649-169)/4=8480/4=2120 >2023. Therefore, minimal n is 2120. 

Final answer:

<<<2120>>>
