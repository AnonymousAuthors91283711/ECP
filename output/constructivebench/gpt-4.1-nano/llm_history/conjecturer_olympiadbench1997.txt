Given the pattern in enumerated answers and the Riemann sum nature of the problem, the minimal total sum for such sets is achieved when the set elements are evenly distributed around the sum, resulting in an arithmetic progression. The structure suggests the total sum relates to the sum of integers from 1 to n, scaled appropriately with k. Conjectured answer: the total sum approximates k(n - 1/2) when distributing elements uniformly. 

Final answer:
<<<fun k : ℕ => k * (2 * (k + 1) / 2)>>>
