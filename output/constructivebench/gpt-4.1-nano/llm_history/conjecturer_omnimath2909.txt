theorem omnimath2909 (n : ℕ) :
  IsLeast {u : ℕ | ∃ (a b c d e f g h : ℕ),
    [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, u] = [n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, n+5, n+6, n+7, n+8] ∧
    a + b + c = d + e + f ∧
    a + b + c = g + h + u ∧
    a + b + c = c + f + u ∧
    a + b + c = a + e + h}
  (omnimath2909_answer n) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The pattern indicates the answer involves minimizing the value u satisfying the constraints. Since u appears directly as the last element in the list and the equalities relate the sums of parts, the minimal u consistent with the constraints is n.  
Thus, the answer is the minimal u = n.  
Final expression:  
<<<fun n : ℕ => n>>>
