Based on pattern analysis, the value of \(k\) satisfying the equation involves the power of 2 in the denominator, with T = -8 suggesting a power of \(2^{8}\). The expression \(( -1 + i )^k\) relates to complex modulus and argument; for the equality to hold, \(k\) must match the specific exponent where the complex number's magnitude and argument align. This occurs when \(k = 16\).

The root of the problem is that the answer should be a concrete ℕ value, not a string or a verbose comment. The pattern suggests the answer relates to the magnitude and argument of \((-1 + i)^k\), where \(-1 + i\) has magnitude \(\sqrt{2}\) and argument \(\frac{3\pi}{4}\) (135°). 

Since \( ( \sqrt{2} e^{i \frac{3\pi}{4}} )^k = 2^{k/2} e^{i \frac{3\pi}{4} k} \), for the expression to equal \(\frac{1}{2^T}\) (which is \(2^8\)), the magnitudes must match, giving \(2^{k/2} = 2^{8}\), so \(k/2 = 8 \Rightarrow k=16\). Also, the argument must satisfy \(e^{i \frac{3\pi}{4} k} = 1\), which occurs when \(\frac{3\pi}{4} k\) is a multiple of \(2\pi\):

\[
\frac{3\pi}{4}k = 2\pi m \Rightarrow 3k/4 = 2m \Rightarrow 3k = 8m
\]

Since \(k=16\), check \(3 \times 16 = 48\), and \(8m=48\) implies \(m=6\), integer, hence consistent. 

Thus, \(k=16\) satisfies the magnitude and argument conditions.

Therefore, the answer should be a fixed natural number:

<<<16>>>
