Ground Truth Answer: 37
Proposed Answer: 25
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a 3-digit number abc (where a is 1-9, b,c are 0-9) where:
   - a + b + c ≤ 7
   - There exists t>0 such that abc + 55t = cba (the reversed number)
   - The sum of squares a² + b² + c² equals the answer

2. The ground truth answer is 37, which comes from the solution 143:
   - 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 (but this violates the ≤7 condition, so this can't be correct)
   - Wait, this suggests the ground truth might be incorrect or there's a different solution

3. The proposed answer is 25, which would come from numbers like:
   - 104: 1² + 0² + 4² = 17
   - 105: 1 + 0 + 5 = 6 ≤7, 1²+0²+5²=26
   - 102: 1+0+2=3 ≤7, 1²+0²+2²=5
   - 103: 1+0+3=4 ≤7, 1²+0²+3²=10
   - 121: 1+2+1=4 ≤7, 1²+2²+1²=6
   - 122: 1+2+2=5 ≤7, 1²+2²+2²=9
   - 123: 1+2+3=6 ≤7, 1²+2²+3²=14
   - 124: 1+2+4=7 ≤7, 1²+2²+4²=21
   - 125: 1+2+5=8 >7 (invalid)
   - 132: 1+3+2=6 ≤7, 1²+3²+2²=14
   - 133: 1+3+3=7 ≤7, 1²+3²+3²=19
   - 134: 1+3+4=8 >7 (invalid)
   - 141: 1+4+1=6 ≤7, 1²+4²+1²=18
   - 142: 1+4+2=7 ≤7, 1²+4²+2²=21
   - 143: 1+4+3=8 >7 (invalid)

None of these give 25, and the only number that gives 37 (143) violates the sum condition. This suggests either:
- The ground truth is incorrect
- There's a solution we're missing
- The proposed answer is incorrect

Given that neither answer seems to match any valid solution under the given constraints, and since the ground truth appears to violate its own conditions, I'll return:

<<<False>>>
