Ground Truth Answer: 158 / 7
Proposed Answer: 28
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives a system of equations:
   - a³ - abc = 2
   - b³ - abc = 6
   - c³ - abc = 20
   And asks for the maximum value of s = a³ + b³ + c³

2. The ground truth answer is 158/7 ≈ 22.5714

3. The proposed answer is 28

The proposed answer (28) is significantly larger than the ground truth answer (158/7 ≈ 22.5714). They are clearly different values.
