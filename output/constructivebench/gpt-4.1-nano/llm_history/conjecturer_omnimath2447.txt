open Polynomial

abbrev omnimath2447_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath2447 :
  ∃! (P : ℚ[X]), degree P ≤ 3 ∧
  (∀ x ∈ ({1, 2, 3, 4} : Finset ℕ), eval (↑x) P = 1 / (1 + x + x^2)) ∧
  eval 5 P = omnimath2447_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The pattern in the enumeration suggests the answer is the value of the rational function at x=5. Recognize that 1/(1 + x + x^2) is a rational function with a specific form. By evaluating the given expression at x=5, the value is 1 / (1 + 5 + 25) = 1 / 31. The polynomial P matches the constraints and evaluates to this at x=5. 

Since the polynomial is uniquely defined by its constraints, the answer is 1/31.
