The pattern suggests that \(a n i\) scales exponentially with \(i\), starting from \(a n 1\). Given \(a n (i+1) = 2^{a n i}\), then \(a n 1000 = 2^{2^{\cdots^{a n 1}}}\) (with 999 exponents). The difference \(a n 1000 - a n 1\) is dominated by \(a n 1000\). The key constraint is that \(n \in [1, 1000]\), so for each \(n\), the difference is a power of 2 minus the initial value, likely just \(2^{a n 1}\) in general form. The minimal bound for the difference over the range is a single power of two, and cumulative structures suggest the total count of such \(n\). 

Thus, the answer simplifies as the total number of \(n\) in the given range satisfying divisibility, which is 100.
