The question asks for the number of divisors of the integer part of iterating \(f\) at \(\frac{5}{2}\) eight times, where \(f(x) = x^3 - 3x\). Recognizing the pattern, the iteration of \(f\) on a real input resembles Chebyshev polynomials, which produce integer outputs for rational inputs. When starting from \(\frac{5}{2}\), after 8 iterations, the value is expected to be an integer rooted in a fixed polynomial pattern; analyzing the iteration suggests the resulting integer is \(7^8\), leading to the divisors count as \(15\), since \(7\) is prime and \(7^8\) has \(8+1\) divisors.

<<<(8 + 1)>>>

This matches the divisor count of \(7^8\), which is \(8 + 1 = 9\). However, considering mistakes, the correct divisor count of \(7^8\) is \(8 + 1 = 9\). Let's re-evaluate: the number of divisors of \(p^k\) with prime \(p\) is \(k + 1\).

Therefore, the final answer (after correcting the above reasoning) should be:

<<<9>>>
