The pattern suggests we're looking for the minimal size of subset \( S \subseteq [1,2004] \) such that there exist distinct \( a, b \in S \) with \( 2004 \mid a^2 - b^2 \). Since \( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \), divisibility by 2004 implies \( (a - b)(a + b) \equiv 0 \pmod{2004} \). To minimize \( |S| \), singleton sets are insufficient; we need at least pairs. Choosing all numbers congruent modulo divisors of 2004 yields the size as \( 2004 / \gcd(2, 2004) \). The minimal such subset size is 2, since such pairs exist.
