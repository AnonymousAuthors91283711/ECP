Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => a * b = 0 ∧ a + b ≥ 0
Proposed Answer:  fun a b => ((a = 0 ∧ b ≥ 0) ∨ (b = 0 ∧ a ≥ 0) ∨ (a = b ∧ a ≥ 0))
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground Truth: a*b = 0 ∧ a + b ≥ 0
- This means at least one of a or b is zero, and their sum is non-negative

Proposed Answer: ((a = 0 ∧ b ≥ 0) ∨ (b = 0 ∧ a ≥ 0) ∨ (a = b ∧ a ≥ 0))
- This has three cases:
  1. a is zero and b is non-negative
  2. b is zero and a is non-negative
  3. a equals b and both are non-negative

The first two cases of the proposed answer exactly match the ground truth when one variable is zero. However, the third case (a = b ∧ a ≥ 0) is problematic because:
- It allows non-zero solutions where a = b > 0
- But sqrt(a² + b²) = a + b would require sqrt(2a²) = 2a ⇒ a√2 = 2a ⇒ √2 = 2, which is false
- Therefore, the third case introduces incorrect solutions

The proposed answer is mostly correct but includes an extra incorrect case. The first two disjuncts are equivalent to the ground truth, but the third one makes the answer incorrect.
