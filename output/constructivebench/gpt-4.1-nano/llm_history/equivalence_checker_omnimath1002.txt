abbrev omnimath1002_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1002 :
  let n := (2021 : ℝ)
  let p := (2 * (n - 2)) / (n * (n - 1))
  ⌊n * p⌋ = omnimath1002_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 674
Proposed Answer:  (2021 - 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating ⌊n * p⌋ where:
   - n = 2021 (as a real number)
   - p = (2*(n-2))/(n*(n-1))

2. Let's compute n*p:
   n*p = 2021 * (2*(2021-2))/(2021*(2021-1)) = 2*(2019)/2020 = 4038/2020 ≈ 1.9990099

3. The floor of this value is ⌊1.9990099⌋ = 1

4. The ground truth answer is 674, which is clearly incorrect based on this calculation.

5. The proposed answer is (2021-1) = 2020, which is also incorrect.

Both answers are wrong, but they're wrong in different ways. The ground truth answer (674) is completely off, while the proposed answer (2020) is at least in the right order of magnitude but still incorrect.
