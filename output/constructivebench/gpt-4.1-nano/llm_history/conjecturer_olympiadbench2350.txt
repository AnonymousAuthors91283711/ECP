Because the function f(n) considers combinations offset by small constants, its last digit pattern repeats periodically. The pattern in enumerations suggests every 10 integers, the count of k with f(k) ≡ 1 mod 10 stabilizes, culminating in a total proportional to the product of total integers and the pattern frequency. Final simplified answer:
<<<403>>>
