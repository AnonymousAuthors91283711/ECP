Ground Truth Answer: {(3, 3)}
Proposed Answer: {(p, q) | p = 2 ∧ q = 2} ∪ {(p, q) | p = 3 ∧ q = 2} ∪ {(p, q) | p = 2 ∧ q = 3}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for pairs of prime numbers (p,q) where 3*p^(q-1)+1 divides 11^p + 17^p.

2. Ground truth gives only one pair: (3,3).

3. Proposed answer gives three pairs: (2,2), (3,2), and (2,3).

Let's test the proposed pairs:
- For (2,2): 3*2^(2-1)+1=7, 11^2+17^2=121+289=410. 7 doesn't divide 410.
- For (3,2): 3*3^(2-1)+1=10, 11^3+17^3=1331+4913=6244. 10 doesn't divide 6244.
- For (2,3): 3*2^(3-1)+1=13, 410 again. 13 doesn't divide 410.

The ground truth pair (3,3):
3*3^(3-1)+1=28, 11^3+17^3=6244. 6244/28=223, which is integer.

The proposed answer contains no correct pairs, while the ground truth contains one correct pair.
