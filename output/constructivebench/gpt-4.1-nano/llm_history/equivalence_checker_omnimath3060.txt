Ground Truth Answer: 2625
Proposed Answer: 100 * 105
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting pairs (p₁, p₂) where:
   - 1 ≤ p₁ ≤ 100
   - 101 ≤ p₂ ≤ 205
   - 3^p₁ + 7^p₂ ≡ 0 mod 10

2. The ground truth answer is 2625.

3. The proposed answer is 100 * 105 = 10500.

Analysis:
- The range for p₁ gives 100 possible values (1-100)
- The range for p₂ gives 105 possible values (101-205)
- The proposed answer is simply multiplying these counts without considering the modulo condition
- The actual count should be much smaller since we need 3^p₁ + 7^p₂ ≡ 0 mod 10
- The ground truth answer (2625) is exactly 1/4 of the proposed answer (10500)

This suggests the proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't account for the modulo condition. The correct count would need to consider the cyclic patterns of 3^n and 7^n modulo 10 and count only the pairs where their sum is divisible by 10.
