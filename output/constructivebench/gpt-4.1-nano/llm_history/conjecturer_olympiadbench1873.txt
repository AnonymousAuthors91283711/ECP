Given the symmetric polynomial expression involving degrees i, j, k with constraints i + j + k ≥ n, and the structure of polynomial decompositions, the minimal n satisfying the approach is 3, corresponding to the degree where all monomials of degree ≥ 3 can be expressed via the generating set involving lower-degree symmetric polynomials. 

Hence, the answer is the minimal such n, which is 3.
