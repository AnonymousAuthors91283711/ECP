  P2011AMCA_5_answer = (30 : ℚ) / (100 - 25) * 100 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 40
Proposed Answer: (30 / (100 - 25)) * 100
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem is evaluating the expression (30 / (100 - 25)) * 100
2. First, we calculate the denominator: 100 - 25 = 75
3. Then we do the division: 30 / 75 = 0.4
4. Finally, multiply by 100: 0.4 * 100 = 40

The ground truth answer is 40, which matches exactly with our calculation. The proposed answer is the exact expression that evaluates to 40.

Therefore, the proposed answer is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth answer.
