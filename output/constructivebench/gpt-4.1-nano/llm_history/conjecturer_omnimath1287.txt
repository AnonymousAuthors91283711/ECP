The problem describes 6×6 matrices over Fin 2 with exactly two zeros in each row and column, forming a bipartite graph with degree 2 on both sides. This configuration resembles a 2-regular bipartite graph on 6 vertices each, which decomposes into disjoint cycles covering all vertices. Each such configuration corresponds to a perfect matching cover of disjoint 2-cycles, forming a union of cycles. The only 2-regular bipartite graphs on 6 vertices are unions of 3 disjoint 2-cycles and/or 6-cycles, with counts matching the cycle decompositions. The total number of such configurations is 90, considering cycle arrangements and pairings.

Thus, the total count is 90.

Final answer:
<<<90>>>
