The problem involves counting roots of unity. There are 24 roots of unity \( z \) satisfying \( z^{24} = 1 \), which are the 24th roots of unity. The roots with \( (z^6).im = 0 \) are those roots where \( z^6 \in \mathbb{R} \), that is \( z^6 = \pm 1 \). The roots of \( z^6 = 1 \) are the 6th roots of unity, with 6 solutions, all with real parts: \(1, \zeta_6, \zeta_6^2, \zeta_6^3, \zeta_6^4, \zeta_6^5 \) (these satisfy \( (z^6).im=0 \)). The roots of \( z^6 = -1 \) are solutions of \( z^{12} = 1 \cdot (-1) \), which are roots where \( z^{12} = -1 \). There are 2 such solutions: a pair of roots with \( z^6 = -1 \), which are roots of unity of order 12 with argument \( \pi/6 \) and \( 5\pi/6 \), etc., but these roots satisfy \( z^6 = -1 \). Counting solutions with real part zero occurs for roots where \( z^6 = \pm 1 \), so total solutions with imaginary part zero are:

- For \( z^6 = 1 \) (6 solutions),
- For \( z^6 = -1 \) (2 solutions).

Thus total solutions with \( (z^6).im=0 \) are 8.

**Fixing the Lean code**

In the initial code, the answer is defined with `abbrev` and an `:= sorry`, which is not valid if you want to define a constant. Also, since the question is about the count of such roots, it should be type `ℕ`, with an explicit value.

The answer is the count of roots where \( z^6 = \pm 1 \).

Hence, the total number of solutions for \( z^6 = 1 \) is 6, for \( z^6 = -1 \) it is 2, total 8.

These roots are roots of unity of orders dividing 6 and 12 respectively.

**Proposed answer in Lean:**

<<<8>>>

**Explanations:** 
The problem asks for the number of roots \( z \) of \( z^{24} = 1 \) such that \( (z^6) \) is real, i.e., \( z^6 = \pm 1 \). The roots where \( z^6 = 1 \) are the 6th roots of unity (6 solutions). The roots where \( z^6 = -1 \) are solutions to \( z^{12} = 1 \), with exactly 2 solutions corresponding to roots at angles \(\pi/6\) and \(5\pi/6\). Accordingly, the total solutions with \( (z^6).im=0 \) are 6 + 2 = 8. 

Thus, the final answer in Lean is simply 8.
