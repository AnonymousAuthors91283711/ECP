The error indicates that the answer definition is not properly expressed in Lean syntax, and the phrase "Given n = 7999999999, which factors as ..." is interpreted as invalid code. To fix this, I need to format the answer purely as a Lean expression of type ℕ, representing the greatest prime divisor of n, given the specified factorization.

From the factorization 7 * 11 * 1093 * 333667, the set of prime factors is `{7, 11, 1093, 333667}`. The maximum element in this set is 333667. Since the goal is to produce a value that matches the greatest prime divisor, the answer should be that prime number.

Given these elements, the correct formal answer in Lean should be simply the maximum prime factor, i.e., 333667.

Therefore, the fixed answer is:

<<<333667>>>

This is the largest prime divisor of n = 7999999999, verifying the correctness within the mathematical context.
