theorem omnimath1239 (a b c : ℤ) :
    gcd (X^2 + C a * X + C b) (X^2 + C b * X + C c) = X + C 1 ∧
    lcm (X^2 + C a * X + C b) (X^2 + C b * X + C c) = X^3 - C 4 * X^2 + X + C 6
    ↔ a + b + c = omnimath1239_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The common root of both quadratics is 1, giving sum of roots as -(a + b) and -(b + c), leading to conditions on a, b, c. The sum a + b + c relationally equals 3 due to factorization constraints from the gcdn and lcm. Thus, the answer is 3.
