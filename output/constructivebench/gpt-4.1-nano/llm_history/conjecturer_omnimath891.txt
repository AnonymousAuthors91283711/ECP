  {a : Fin 10 → ℤ | (∀ n : Fin 8, a (n + 2) = a (n + 1) + a n) ∧ a 9 = 2002 ∧ (∀ n : Fin 10, a n > 0)}.encard = omnimath891_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests solving a second-order linear recurrence with initial conditions, leading to Fibonacci-like solutions. Given a₂, a₃ determined by recurrence, and a 9th term of 2002, the sequence's linearity indicates proportional scaling of Fibonacci numbers. Computing the initial coefficient scaled to match a₉=2002 provides the answer.
