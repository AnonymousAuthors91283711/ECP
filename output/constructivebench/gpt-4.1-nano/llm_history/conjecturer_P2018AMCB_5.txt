theorem P2018AMCB_5 :
  {s : Set ℕ | s ⊆ {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} ∧ ∃ p ∈ s, Nat.Prime p}.ncard = P2018AMCB_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The set s must be a subset of {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} containing at least one prime, i.e., 2, 3, 5, or 7. There are 2^8 total subsets, but we exclude the 2^8 - 1 subsets without primes, leaving 2^4 = 16 those with at least one prime.  
The maximum combinatorial count is 16, so the answer is the total subsets with non-empty prime elements: 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 - to account for overlaps? No, directly 16 as sum of subsets with at least one prime.  
Final expression: <<<16>>>
