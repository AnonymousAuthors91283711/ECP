Ground Truth Answer: 11
Proposed Answer: 16
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find natural numbers a and b such that:
   - The matrix M can be expressed as M_ij = row_ops_i + 2*col_ops_j
   - The sum of row operations equals a
   - The sum of column operations equals b
   - a + b is minimized (implied by the existential quantification)

2. The ground truth answer is 11, which suggests an optimal decomposition where a + b = 11.

3. The proposed answer is 16, which is higher than the ground truth. This means either:
   - The proposed solution is not optimal (likely true)
   - The proposed solution doesn't satisfy all constraints (possible but less likely)

Since 16 is strictly greater than the optimal solution of 11, and the problem asks for an existence proof where a + b equals some minimal value, the proposed answer is incorrect.
