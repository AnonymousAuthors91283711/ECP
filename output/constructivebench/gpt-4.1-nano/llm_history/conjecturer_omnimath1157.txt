theorem omnimath1157 (S : Finset ℕ) (hS : S = range 1999) :
    ∑ E in powerset S, (∑ x in E, x) / (∑ x in S, x) = omnimath1157_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sum over all subsets E of S (where S = range 1999) of the sum of x in E divided by total sum in S equals 1. This is a standard symmetry argument: each element contributes to exactly half of the subsets, and their ratios sum to 1.  
Thus, the answer is 1.
