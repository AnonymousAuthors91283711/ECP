Ground Truth Answer: 190/21
Proposed Answer:  10
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is summing a series of fractions where each denominator is 2*floor(sqrt(k+1)) + 1, for k from 0 to 99.

2. The ground truth answer is 190/21 ≈ 9.0476

3. The proposed answer is 10, which is approximately 10% higher than the ground truth.

4. The proposed answer is close in magnitude but not mathematically equivalent to the ground truth answer.

5. The difference between 10 and 190/21 is significant enough that we can't consider them equivalent.
