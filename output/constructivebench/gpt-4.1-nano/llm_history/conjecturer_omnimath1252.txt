# Insights:
The problem asks for the **least** positive integer \( n \) that can be expressed as the sum of three cubes in two distinct ways with different multisets.
  
# Known facts:
- **Taxicab number 2**, famously known as Hardy–Ramanujan's number, is 1729.
- 1729 = 1^3 + 12^3 = 9^3 + 10^3, a double representation with distinct multisets.
- No smaller positive such number is known or exists based on classical number theory.

# Conjecture:
Given classical mathematical facts, the minimal such \( n \) is 1729.

# Final Lean expression:
<<<1729>>>
