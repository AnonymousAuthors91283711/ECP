The key pattern indicates that the sum of certain absolute differences is constant, with the total being 100, based on the enumerated answers. Since adding the two given sums yields 100, and the absolute differences relate via symmetry, the expression for |a - d| + |b - c| is consistent with 100 minus the sum of the other two differences. 

Final answer:

<<<100 - (|a - b| + |c - d| + |a - c| + |b - d|) + (|a - b| + |c - d|) + (|a - c| + |b - d|) - 100>>>

which simplifies to:

The proposed answer is a complex algebraic expression involving absolute values of differences of variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`. The errors stem from attempting to use `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` inside an abbreviation without defining them; in Lean, identifiers like `a` are invisible in the scope of the `abbrev` declaration unless they are parameters or globally defined. To fix this, the correct approach is to define the answer as a function of the parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`. 

From the pattern in the enumerated answers, the expression seems to involve combining the absolute differences with constants, likely deriving from triangle inequality or known bounds in the problem, which involves sums of absolute differences. The pattern suggests that the answer is a function of the maximum possible value minus some sum of these absolute differences, or a form involving `100 - (|a - b| + |c - d| + |a - c| + |b - d|)`.

Since the variables are parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and the expression depends on them, the best closed-form answer consistent with the pattern is: 
```lean
fun a b c d => 100 - (|a - b| + |c - d| + |a - c| + |b - d|)
```

This also aligns with the enumerated answer pattern, simplifying the problem into a parametric expression.

Final answer enclosed in delimiters:

<<<fun a b c d => 100 - (|a - b| + |c - d| + |a - c| + |b - d|)>>>

This gives a closed form that is general, correctly scoped, and matches the pattern seen in the enumerated options without unnecessary complexity.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The core issue with your proposed answer is that in Lean, a function type like `(a b c d : ℝ) → ℝ` cannot be assigned directly to an `abbrev` with just `:=`. Instead, you need to define a function explicitly, not an abbreviation that is a lambda expression, because lean's `abbrev` expect a term of the specific type, not a function with multiple arguments. To fix this, the most straightforward way is to define a closed-form expression as a function rather than an abbreviation that involves parameters.

Given the structure of your problem's enumerated hints and the related equalities, a natural conjecture is that the answer depends linearly on the sums of certain absolute differences; specifically, the criteria suggest a symmetric expression involving the sum of differences.

Based on the enumerated pattern, the formula is likely:

\[ 100 - (|a - b| + |c - d| + |a - c| + |b - d|) \]

which is a scalar (real number) expression, not a function that takes `a b c d` as parameters. Therefore, to correct your code, you should define `omnimath773_answer` as a real number constant, i.e.:

```lean
abbrev omnimath773_answer : ℝ := 100 - (|a - b| + |c - d| + |a - c| + |b - d|).eval
```

But this isn't syntactically correct because `a b c d` are variables, not present at the point of defining the abbreviation. Instead, you should define a function:

```lean
def omnimath773_answer (a b c d : ℝ) : ℝ := 100 - (|a - b| + |c - d| + |a - c| + |b - d|)
```

And then, in the theorem statement, replace the conclusion with:

```lean
|a - d| + |b - c| = omnimath773_answer a b c d
```

Hence, the corrected answer expression that should compile and match the reasoning is:

<<<def omnimath773_answer (a b c d : ℝ) : ℝ := 100 - (|a - b| + |c - d| + |a - c| + |b - d>)>>>

This is a clean, closed-form, general definition compatible with typical Lean syntax, and it aligns with the enumerated pattern.

**Summary**: The main issue was using an erroneous `abbrev` with a function lambda; the fix is to define a proper function taking `a b c d` as arguments, thereby making the estimate compile correctly and be flexible enough for proof.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The problem involves defining an answer in terms of the given variables and their absolute differences. The initial proposed answer attempts to use an expression with variables 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' directly inside an `abbrev` which does not allow variable names. To fix the error, I should define a function or lambda that takes `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` as inputs and then computes the expression.

The pattern in the enumeration suggests the answer relates to the sum of the absolute differences or some symmetrical function involving these variables. The hint "100 - (|a - b| + |c - d| + |a - c| + |b - d|)" indicates the answer might be a fixed quantity minus the sum of these differences, suggesting a symmetric relation.

Thus, the correct approach is to define `omnimath773_answer` as a function (say, of type `(ℝ × ℝ × ℝ × ℝ) → ℝ`) which takes `(a, b, c, d)` and returns the specified form. Then, in the theorem, we apply this function.

The current attempt defines `omnimath773_answer` as a function expecting a tuple of four real numbers, but the inductive constructor notation `⟨a, b, c, d⟩` is inappropriate for `abbrev` of type `ℝ`. The goal, as indicated by the theorem, is to specify a closed-form real expression independent of explicit variables; the statement "∀ a b c d ..." suggests that the answer should be a closed-form expression, not a function expecting four variables.

From the pattern in the enumeration and the given equations, the problem resembles a geometric configuration where the sum of distances between pairs is constrained to 99 and 1, and the quantity to calculate is symmetric and could be expressed in terms of these constants. Since the answer involves the sum of the distances `|a - d| + |b - c|`, and the logic indicates certain symmetry, a plausible closed-form answer is `99`. This is consistent with the assumption that the distances are arranged so that the sum `|a - d| + |b - c|` complements the given sum constraints.

Given the error and the pattern, the correct form is a constant real number, independent of variables:

```lean
abbrev omnimath773_answer : ℝ := 99
```

This aligns with the example pattern where an answer is a specific numeric constant satisfying the equations.
