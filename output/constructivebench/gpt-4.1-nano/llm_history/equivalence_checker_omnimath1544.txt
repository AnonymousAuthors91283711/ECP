Ground Truth Answer: {1 / 2}
Proposed Answer: {z | ∃ x : ℝ, z = (x^3 + 2 * x^2 + x) / (x + 2)^2}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a set of real numbers z that can be expressed as z = x + 2y² where (x,y) satisfies a specific polynomial equation P(x,y).

2. The ground truth answer is {1/2}, meaning the only solution is z = 1/2.

3. The proposed answer gives a parametric form for z in terms of x alone, suggesting multiple possible values depending on x.

Key observations:
- The ground truth claims there's exactly one solution (1/2)
- The proposed answer suggests a continuum of possible solutions parameterized by x
- These cannot be equivalent since one is a singleton set and the other is a parameterized set
- Testing x = -1 in the proposed answer gives z = 0, which contradicts the ground truth
