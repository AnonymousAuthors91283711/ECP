  ∃ m n : ℕ, 0 < m ∧ 0 < n ∧ Coprime m n ∧ m/n = 2/5 + 8/25 ∧ m + n = P2000AIMEII_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sum m/n = 2/5 + 8/25 = 10/25 + 8/25 = 18/25 suggests coprime m, n with m/n = 18/25. Given m and n coprime, m=18, n=25. Sum m + n = 43.  
Final answer: <<<43>>>
