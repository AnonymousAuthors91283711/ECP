theorem P2006AMCB_4 : 
  IsLeast {p : ℝ | ∃ (change : ℝ), 
    change = 20 - (7.99 + 4.99 + 2.99 + 1.99 + 0.99) ∧

Ground Truth Answer: 5
Proposed Answer: 0.3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the least value of p where p is the absolute difference between a percentage calculation and some answer (P2006AMCB_4_answer).

2. The percentage calculation is based on change from $20 after purchasing items totaling $7.99 + $4.99 + $2.99 + $1.99 + $0.99 = $18.95, leaving $1.05 change.

3. The percentage of change relative to $20 is (1.05/20)*100 = 5.25%

4. The ground truth answer is 5, meaning the absolute difference would be |5.25 - 5| = 0.25

5. The proposed answer is 0.3, which is different from both the ground truth (5) and the actual calculated difference (0.25)

The proposed answer doesn't match either the ground truth or what would be the correct calculation. Therefore:

<<<False>>>
