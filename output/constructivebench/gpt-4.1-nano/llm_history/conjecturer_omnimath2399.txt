The condition states selecting functions from Fin 12 to Fin 2 with sum 4, where no two consecutive indices both map to 1 (adjacent ones disallowed). Counting the number of 0-1 sequences of length 12 with exactly 4 ones and no two ones adjacent (like choosing 4 positions out of 12 with gaps). The count is C(12 - 4 + 1, 4) = C(9, 4).
