Since the sum only adds terms for k ≥ 4, and choose 8 k = 0 for k > 8, the sum becomes ∑_{k=4}^8 (choose 8 k)*(1/2)^8. Recognizing this as the tail of binomial expansion, the sum simplifies to 1 - ∑_{k=0}^3 (choose 8 k)*(1/2)^8, which is 1 - (1/2)^8 * ∑_{k=0}^3 choose 8 k. The sum of first four binomial coefficients in row 8 is 1 + 8 + 28 + 56 = 93. Therefore, the total sum is (1/2)^8 * (256 - 93) = (1/2)^8 * 163 = 163 / 256. <<<(163/256)>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The main issue in your current Lean code is related to the syntax of summations. The error message indicates that the notation `∑ k in ...` is deprecated and should be replaced with `∑ k ∈ ...`. Moreover, to formalize the answer, we need a closed-form expression, which we've derived as: 

\[
\frac{1}{2^8} \times \left(2^8 - \sum_{k=0}^{3} \binom{8}{k}\right)
\]

The sum of binomial coefficients for \(k=0\) to \(3\) in row 8 is \(1 + 8 + 28 + 56 = 93\).

Thus, the answer simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{2^8} \times (256 - 93) = \frac{163}{256}
\]

In Lean, this is represented as `163/256`.

Therefore, the formal corrected answer in Lean syntax, enclosed within `<<< >>>`, is:

<<<(163/256)>>>

This form is close to the enumerated answer and directly leverages the binomial theorem tail sum calculation, avoiding explicit summation over binomial coefficients.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The main issues are syntax errors and deprecated notation handling. The abbreviation is currently written as a theorem, which is invalid syntax for a definition. Additionally, the summation notation should be corrected to `∑ k ∈ ...` form for proper Lean syntax, with `Finset.range 9` representing the summation set.

Given the sum involves binomial coefficients `choose 8 k` for `k` from 4 to 8, with all other terms zero, the sum simplifies to:

∑_{k=4}^{8} (choose 8 k) * (1/2)^8.

This sum is known to be equal to (sum over k=0 to 8 of binomial coefficients) minus the sum over k=0 to 3, which totals to 1 because the binomial sum over the full range is 2^8, and the tail sum is (1/2)^8 times the binomial coefficients' sum over that range.

The sum of all `choose 8 k` for k=0..8 is 2^8 = 256.

The partial sum over k=4..8 is:

∑_{k=4}^8 choose 8 k = 2^8 - ∑_{k=0}^3 choose 8 k.

Using binomial symmetry and identities, that sum equals 128.

Multiplying by `(1/2)^8`, the sum becomes:

128 * (1/2)^8 = 128 / 256 = 1/2.

Therefore, the answer is 1/2, which in Lean in ℚ is `1/2`.

Final corrected code will be:

<<<
abbrev omnimath2545_answer : ℚ := 1/2
>>>

Explanations:
- Changed the definition from `theorem` to `abbrev` to make it a value.
- Used proper summation syntax `∑ k ∈ Finset.range 9, ...`.
- Set the value to `1/2`, the calculated sum.
- Addressed parsing errors due to improper syntax or missing braces.

This correction aligns with the problem's sum and the known binomial properties for k=4..8, giving a concise closed-form answer.
