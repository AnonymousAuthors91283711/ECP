Given the expression \( \frac{1}{\cos x} - \tan x = 3 \), simplifying yields \(\sec x - \tan x = 3\). Recognizing the conjugate relation, \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{1}{\sec x - \tan x} = \frac{1}{3}\). Using \(\sec^2 x - \tan^2 x = 1\), substitute \(\sec x + \tan x\) and \(\sec x - \tan x\) to find \(\sin x\). 

The resulting \(\sin x = \frac{4}{5}\).

The error stems from applying `Real.sqrt` as a function, which in Lean is written as `Real.sqrt : ℝ → ℝ`, so it must be applied to an argument within parentheses. The current expression `Real.sqrt(1 - (4/5)^2)` uses parentheses incorrectly. It should be written as `Real.sqrt (1 - (4/5)^2)` with a space separating the function and argument, not parentheses directly attached.

Looking at the pattern from the enumerated answers and the structure of the problem, it suggests the goal is to find the value of `sin x`, where the given relation involves `cos x` and `tan x`, and the answer involves a specific numeric value. The fraction `4/5` indicates a common Pythagorean ratio `3/5`, `4/5`, `5/5`, which hints at a right triangle with hypotenuse 5, opposite 4, adjacent 3, leading to `sin x = 4/5` or an expression involving its square root.

Thus, the corrected form of the answer is:

The current proposed answer is just a conjunction with markup, which Lean does not recognize as a valid expression. It also appears to be directly inserting the placeholder answer with '<<<' which is invalid syntax in Lean.

Analyzing the problem: given that 1 / cos x - tan x = 3, and the goal is to prove sin x = answer. It is natural to relate sine and cosine via the Pythagorean identity, and to manipulate the given expression to extract sin x. Since the numerator involves tangent and cosine, rewriting the expression in terms of sine and cosine will help.

From the equation:

1 / cos x - tan x = 3

Recall tan x = sin x / cos x, so:

1 / cos x - sin x / cos x = 3

Combine as a single fraction:

(1 - sin x) / cos x = 3

Thus,

1 - sin x = 3 cos x

Write sin x in terms of cos x:

sin x = 1 - 3 cos x

Using the Pythagorean identity:

sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1

Substitute sin x:

(1 - 3 cos x)^2 + cos^2 x = 1

Expand:

(1 - 6 cos x + 9 cos^2 x) + cos^2 x = 1

Combine like terms:

1 - 6 cos x + 10 cos^2 x = 1

Subtract 1:

-6 cos x + 10 cos^2 x = 0

Factor:

2 cos x (-3 + 5 cos x) = 0

Solutions:

Either cos x = 0 or 5 cos x - 3 = 0 ⇒ cos x = 3/5

If cos x = 0, then sin x = ±1, but plugging into original expression:

1 / 0 - tan x undefined, so discard.

Otherwise:

cos x = 3/5

From earlier formula:

sin x = 1 - 3 cos x = 1 - 3*(3/5) = 1 - 9/5 = (5/5) - (9/5) = -4/5

Evaluate the square root form:

sin x = -4/5

Expressed as a positive root:

sqrt(1 - (4/5)^2) = sqrt(1 - 16/25) = sqrt(9/25) = 3/5

But, since sin x is negative here, the actual value should be -3/5.

Thus, the solution:

sin x = -3/5

In the answer, to match the '√' form, considering the magnitude:

|sin x| = 3/5 = sqrt(1 - (4/5)^2)

Therefore, the expression representing sin x in the form of the positive root magnitude is:

sqrt(1 - (4/5)^2), with sign determined by the context.

Final answer: -sqrt(1 - (4/5)^2)

But the proposal uses just the positive root. To be precise, the value is negative, thus:

<<-Real.sqrt (1 - (4/5)^2)>>

Here's the fixed declaration:

noncomputable abbrev olympiadbench2458_answer : ℝ := -Real.sqrt (1 - (4/5)^2)

This corrects the syntax error and aligns with the deduced answer logically.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error in your proposed answer stems from syntax issues specific to Lean's syntax for function application and the notation for square root. In Lean, `Real.sqrt` is a function and requires its argument to be enclosed properly, and the expression `Real.sqrt (1 - (4/5)^2)` is valid but the initial version had an error due to missing `)` after `(4/5)^2`. The correction involves ensuring parentheses are properly balanced, and using `Real.sqrt` with correct argument syntax.

Also, note that your answer is a constant value, which fits the problem's hint from the enumerated answers. Considering the numerical value of `4/5` and the structure, this is likely a simplified value related to a special angle in trigonometry (e.g., 36, 45, 53 degrees). Since the answer is `-Real.sqrt (1 - (4/5)^2)`, it corresponds to `-sqrt(1 - (4/5)^2) = -sqrt(1 - 16/25) = -sqrt(9/25) = -3/5`.

In Lean syntax, the answer should be enclosed in parentheses after `Real.sqrt`, e.g., `Real.sqrt (1 - (4/5)^2)`. 

Your original proposed answer should be:
```lean
-Real.sqrt (1 - (4/5)^2)
```
which is syntactically correct in Lean.

So, the final corrected version (which matches your current proposal) is:
```lean
<<< -Real.sqrt (1 - (4/5)^2) >>>
```

This expression now properly aligns with Lean syntax, representing the negative square root of `1 - (4/5)^2`, namely `-3/5`. It is a clean, closed-form, and simple answer that corresponds to a well-known trigonometric value (for example, `sin x = 3/5` or `4/5` at certain angles). Given the structure and the problem statement, this is a plausible and correct closed-form answer to the problem.
