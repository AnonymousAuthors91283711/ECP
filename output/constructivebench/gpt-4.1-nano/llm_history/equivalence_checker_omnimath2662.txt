theorem omnimath2662 : 
  ∃ (p q r : ℝ), (p * q) * (q * r) * (r * p) = 16 ∧ p * q * r = omnimath2662_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find real numbers p, q, r such that:
   - (p*q)*(q*r)*(r*p) = 16
   - p*q*r equals some value (which we're trying to find)

2. Let's simplify the first condition:
   (p*q)*(q*r)*(r*p) = (p*q*r)^2 = 16
   Therefore, p*q*r = ±4

3. The ground truth answer is 4 (the positive solution)
4. The proposed answer is 2, which doesn't satisfy (2^2 = 4 ≠ 16)

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It doesn't satisfy the given equation (would require 2^2 = 16)
- It's only half of the correct value

<<<False>>>
