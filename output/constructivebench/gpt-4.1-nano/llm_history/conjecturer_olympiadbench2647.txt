Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 48, which is at "−7, 2, −7)" in "abbrev olympiadbench2647_answer : ℤ × ℤ × ℤ := (−7, 2, −7)", there is an error: expected token.

The error in the current proposed answer arises because in Lean, the notation for defining an abbreviation with a pair (or tuple) should be enclosed with parentheses; otherwise, Lean expects a type or an expression starting with a token. Here, the parentheses around the tuple `(−7, 2, −7)` are missing, and the unary minus might not be correctly parsed with the standard ASCII character. Replacing the '−' (minus sign) with the standard ASCII hyphen-minus '-' and enclosing the tuple in parentheses should fix the syntax error.

Additionally, the tuple `(−7, 2, −7)` is a natural candidate, given the symmetry of the problem and the constructed bounds, which suggest the solution involves small integers, likely with negative values based on the constants.

Given the structure of the problem, the symmetry, and the size bounds for solutions, a similar pattern of solutions likely exists with coordinates being small integers (like ±7, ±2, etc). The pattern in similar problems suggests that solutions are small integers that satisfy the quadratic relations given.

**Final answer:**

<<<( -7, 2, -7 )>>>

**Explanations:**

- Enclosed the tuple with parentheses to satisfy syntax for defining a tuple in Lean.
- Used ASCII minus '-' instead of Unicode minus '−' to avoid parsing issues.
- Chosen the tuple based on the enumerated answer and the problem symmetry, where (-7, 2, -7) satisfies the structure and constraints foreseen by the problem.
- This candidate fits the pattern of solutions involving small integers with some symmetry, consistent with typical Olympiad problem solutions.
