abbrev omnimath494_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath494 : 
  card {r : Fin 5 × Fin 6 × Fin 5 × Fin 6 | 
    let (x1, y1, x2, y2) := r;
    x1.val < x2.val ∧ y1.val < y2.val} = omnimath494_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem counts quadruples with increasing x and y coordinates; pattern suggests n * m * (n - 1) * (m - 1).  
Final answer: <<<5 * 6 * 4 * 5>>>
