  ∀ (x : ℝ), (y = 1 ∧ 4 * x - 2 * y + 3 = 3 * x + 3 * y) ↔ x = omnimath2894_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The key given equation simplifies to a relation between x and y, and with y = 1, the equation reduces to a direct expression in x. Solving 4x - 2(1) + 3 = 3x + 3(1), yielding x = 1. The answer is independent of y once y=1 is fixed, which aligns with the enumeration pattern.
