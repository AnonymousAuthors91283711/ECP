  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 100 * 2^n > 10000 * (1/2)^n} omnimath3445_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The inequality simplifies to 100 * 2^n > 10000 * (1/2)^n, which implies 2^{2n} > 100. The minimal n satisfying this is n = 2, since 2^{2*2} = 16 > 100? No, 16 < 100 not enough; n=4 gives 2^8=256 > 100. Actually, 2^{2n} > 100 means 2n > log_2 100 ≈ 6.64, so n ≥ 4. Final minimal n is 4.
