Given the symmetry of binomial-sum identities, the pattern resembles binomial coefficients summing to 2^k. The sums over 101 range suggest considering the binomial expansion of (1 + 1)^k = 2^k. The summation of fib sums appears aligned with the Fibonacci convolution identities, culminating in Fibonacci numbers with shifted indices. From the pattern, the sum equals a Fibonacci number with a certain index. Noticing the pattern in the enumerations, the sum likely corresponds to a Fibonacci number where the total of the indices is 505, scaled with factorials or derivatives of Fibonacci sequences, giving the total as (fib 505). The sum of the nᵢ's matches the total index, which is 505.  
Final answer: <<<505>>>
