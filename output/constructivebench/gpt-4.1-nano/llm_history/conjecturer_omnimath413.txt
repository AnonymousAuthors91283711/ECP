Given the set conditions, the goal is to find the maximum k such that 2^k divides the number of subsets s of Fin 100 where |(primes ∩ s)| > |(multiples4 ∩ s)|.

Primes and multiples of 4 partition the set {1,...,100} with approximately 25 primes and 24 multiples of 4.

The maximum k occurs when the difference in counts maximizes the divisibility, which aligns with the largest binomial coefficient difference. For the largest difference, choose s to contain all primes and exclude multiples of 4, giving the maximum disparity.

Based on binomial coefficients, the maximal difference relates to the binomial coefficient at n=50 (prime subset), leading to a divisor of 2^{50}.

Answer: <<<50>>>
