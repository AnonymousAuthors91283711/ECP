abbrev P2015AMCB_1_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2015AMCB_1 : (2 : ℚ) - (-2 : ℚ)^(-2 : ℤ) = P2015AMCB_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Based on pattern recognition, the expression involves a rational number involving powers and inverse operations. The enumerated answers suggest a simple rational form. Since \( (-2)^{-2} = \frac{1}{(-2)^2} = \frac{1}{4} \), then \( 2 - (-2)^{-2} = 2 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{8}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{7}{4} \). 

Final answer:

<<<(7 : ℚ) / 4>>>
