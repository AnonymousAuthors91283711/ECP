The pattern suggests a telescoping sum involving products with a sequence where \( a(1) = 1 \) and successive terms increase by at most 1. Under these conditions, the sum resembles the sum of product upward “staircase,” giving the total as a sum of binomial coefficients or restated as powers of two scaled by the initial terms. The pattern indicates the answer is \( 2^{n-1} \).

Final answer:
<<<fun n => 2 ^ (n - 1)>>>
