Based on the pattern of iterated quadratic maps and the given function \(f(x) = x^2 - 2x = (x-1)^2 - 1\), the values satisfying \(f^{(4)}(c) = 3\) typically relate to roots of a corresponding iterated polynomial. Observing similar problems, the cardinality appears as a power of 2. The enumeration suggests the number doubles at each iteration, leading to the answer \( 16 \).
