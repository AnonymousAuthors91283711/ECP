The pattern suggests the divisibility by powers of 3 depends on the factors 2i+1; all are odd, so the only contributions are from factorial related components. The exponential growth of product indicates the highest power of 3 dividing P is determined by the sum of the exponents of 3 in each factor, which resembles the sum of valuation of 2i+1 with respect to 3. Since 2i+1 is never divisible by 3 unless i ≡ 1 mod 3, the total exponent sums approximately to ⌊(99 - 1)/3⌋ + 1 for the maximal power. This points toward a formula of the form: sum of ⌊(i) / 3⌋ over i from 0 to 99. Using properties of valuations, the answer simplifies to a linear sum. The total power of 3 dividing P is thus 49.
