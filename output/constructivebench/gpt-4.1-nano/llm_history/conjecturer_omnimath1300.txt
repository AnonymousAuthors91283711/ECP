theorem omnimath1300 :
  ((List.range 233).filter (fun n => n > 0 ∧ Even n ∧ ¬(10 ∣ n))).sum = omnimath1300_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sum accounts for positive even numbers less than 233 not divisible by 10. These are numbers n = 2k with k from 1 to 116, excluding multiples of 5 (since 10 | n). Sum of all even numbers up to 232 minus those divisible by 10 gives:
Sum = sum_{k=1}^{116} 2k - sum_{k=1}^{23} 10k. Simplify yields 2 * (116*117/2) - 10 * (23*24/2).
Answer: 27132.
<<<(2 * (116 * 117 / 2)) - (10 * (23 * 24 / 2))>>>
