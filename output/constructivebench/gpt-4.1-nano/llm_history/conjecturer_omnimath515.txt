noncomputable abbrev omnimath515_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath515 (x y : ℝ) 
  (h1 : 56 * x + 33 * y = -y / (x^2 + y^2)) 
  (h2 : 33 * x - 56 * y = x / (x^2 + y^2)) :
  |x| + |y| = omnimath515_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests symmetric relations with coefficients 56, 33, and the sum of absolute values. Deriving from the pattern, the answer is (113/65). Thus:

<<<(113/65)>>>
