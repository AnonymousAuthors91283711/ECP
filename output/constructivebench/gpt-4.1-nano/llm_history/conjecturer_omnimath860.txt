Given the complexity, the key is the interplay of factorial, power iteration, and their magnitudes. The nested factorial iteration 100! grows faster than exponential iterations, so the minimal n satisfying the inequality is likely 1. The expression iterates factorial 100 times starting from 100! which yields a very large number, exceeding any reasonable power iteration for small n.

Thus, the minimal such n is 1 to satisfy the inequality.
