theorem omnimath2691 :

  let zed_exe_ratio := 16
  zed_exe_ratio * exe_wye_ratio = omnimath2691_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the answer involves the product of the given ratios: 29 and 16, possibly multiplied by some factor. Since the ratio relation explicitly states zed_exe_ratio * exe_wye_ratio = answer, the consistent closed-form answer should just be their product.

<<<29 * 16>>>
