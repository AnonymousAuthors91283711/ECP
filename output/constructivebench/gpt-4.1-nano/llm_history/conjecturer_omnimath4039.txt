The maximum number of disjoint companies such that each company's inter-set liking restrictions are satisfied, considering the sets are subsets of girls and boys, is constrained by the smaller set.

Given 9 girls and 15 boys, the largest number of such disjoint companies corresponds to the number of girls, since each company must contain at least one girl and respect liking restrictions. The limiting factor is the number of girls, which is 9, because each company must include at least one girl to satisfy the liking condition.

Final answer:
<<<9>>>
