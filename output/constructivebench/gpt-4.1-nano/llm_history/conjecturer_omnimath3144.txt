Given the product form and the limit tending to 1 from left, the dominant behavior involves the ratio of consecutive terms. The infinite product telescopes or simplifies to a constant involving exponential/logarithmic relations. The conjecture is that the limit evaluates to 1, as the factors approach 1 for x near 1.

The errors are caused by confusing a natural language description with actual Lean code. The "abbrev" line should define a concrete real number as the answer, not a paragraph of explanation. From the reasoning, near x ‚âà 1, the product tends to 1 because each factor approaches 1, and the whole infinite product converges to 1.

The pattern in the enumerated answer and mathematical intuition supports that the answer should be exactly 1.

Thus, the corrected solution is the constant real number 1, expressed properly in Lean.

This closed-form answer encapsulates the limit's value based on the product's limiting behavior near 1, and adheres to Lean syntax by assigning a real number constant.
