The pattern suggests searching for the minimal sum s with a fixed positive k, summing over range 18, and s being a perfect square. The minimal sum occurs at k=1, giving sum of consecutive integers from 1 to 18, which is 18*19/2=171; total sum is 171 + k*18. As k=1, sum = 171 + 1*18=189, but since sum of consecutive integers is 171, and sum over shifted range starting at k is k*18 plus the sum of 0..17, the minimal sum when k=1 is 189. Actually, to minimize, choose k=1, sum over i=0..17 of (k+i) = sum of 1..18 = 171, plus another term for the square — but directly, the minimal sum is sum of integers 1..18. 

Answer: 171.
