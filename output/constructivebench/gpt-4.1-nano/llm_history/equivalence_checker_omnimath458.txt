Ground Truth Answer: 982982
Proposed Answer: 196400
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a number (omnimath458_answer) that:
   - Is a 6-digit number formed as 100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C where A,B,C < 10
   - Equals 491 * (100*A + 10*B + C) * 2
   - Where 491 is prime and (100*A + 10*B + C) is prime

2. Ground truth answer is 982982:
   - This equals 100100*9 + 10010*8 + 1001*2 (A=9, B=8, C=2)
   - 982982 = 491 * 1001 * 2 (where 1001 = 100*9 + 10*8 + 1*2)
   - 491 is prime and 1001 is prime (though actually 1001 = 7*11*13, so this appears to be an error in the ground truth)

3. Proposed answer is 196400:
   - This would require 100100*A + ... = 196400
   - But 100100*1 = 100100, 100100*2 = 200200, so no single-digit A can produce this
   - Also 196400/491/2 ≈ 200, but 200 isn't prime

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy any of the required conditions, while the ground truth answer satisfies all except the primality of the 3-digit number (which appears to be incorrect in the ground truth). However, the proposed answer is completely wrong.
