The divisibility condition suggests that (((n!)!)!) contains the prime factors of (2004)! precisely when n! contains enough factors to reach 2004!, because factorials accumulate prime factors quickly. The smallest n satisfying this is when n! ≥ 2004!, that is, n ≥ 2004. Since for n ≥ 2004, n! contains enough factors, the greatest such n is n = 2004.
