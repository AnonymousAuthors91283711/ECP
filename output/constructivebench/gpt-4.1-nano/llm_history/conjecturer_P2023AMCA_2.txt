abbrev P2023AMCA_2_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2023AMCA_2 : 
  ∃! (w : ℚ), 1/3 * w + 7/2 * (1/4) = 3/4 * w + 1/2 * (1/4) ∧ w = P2023AMCA_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Based on the linear equation, solve for \(w\). The unique solution is obtained by isolating \(w\):

\[
\frac{1}{3}w + \frac{7}{8} = \frac{3}{4}w + \frac{1}{8}
\]

which simplifies to \(w = \frac{3}{4}\).  
Given the unique solution, the answer is:

<<<(3/4 : ℚ)>>>
