The pattern indicates functions with period 22, avoiding two consecutive 'true' values separated by 2. Patterns suggest the count involves sequences of length 22 with exactly one 'true' per 2-length segment, avoiding adjacent 'true's separated by 2. Generalizing, total sequences are \( 2^{n-1} \) for period n, reduced for adjacency constraints. For period 22, valid sequences are \( 2^{21} \). 

Answer: <<<2 ^ 21>>>
