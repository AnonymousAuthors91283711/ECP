The problem seeks the minimal K' > 9 such that (2010 - 10) is divisible by K'−9 and for all other divisors, the absolute difference from 49 is minimized. 2010−10=2000; divisors of 2000 are factors of the form (K'−9). The minimal difference occurs at K'=49, making (K'−9)=40 as the divisor.

The errors stem from trying to embed a textual explanation directly as an abbreviation, which Lean cannot parse as a numerical value. Instead, the goal is to produce a concrete, computable, closed-form answer for K', which in this problem corresponds to the divisor of 2000 closest to 40, as 2000 = 40 * 50.

Analyzing the problem:  
- 2000 = (K'-9).  
- Divisors of 2000 are numbers of interest, specifically those close to 40, since the minimal difference occurs at (K'-9)=40.  
- K' = 40 + 9 = 49.  

Thus, the minimal K' > 9 satisfying the divisibility condition and minimizing the absolute difference from 49 is K' = 49.

Final Lean answer:
