theorem P2004AMCB_8 (n : ℕ) (h : n = 100) : 
  IsLeast {k : ℕ | Finset.sum (Finset.range k) (fun i => 2 * i + 1) = n} (P2004AMCB_8_answer n) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Since the sum of the first k odd numbers is k², and n=100, the minimal k satisfying sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (2i+1) = 100 is k=10 because 10²=100. Hence, the answer is 10 for any n=100.

Therefore, the answer expression is:
<<<fun n : ℕ => 10>>>
