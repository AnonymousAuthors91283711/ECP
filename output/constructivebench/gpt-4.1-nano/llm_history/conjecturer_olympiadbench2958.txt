The equations imply the existence of roots \(x, y\) satisfying certain polynomial conditions. The roots are related via symmetric expressions involving \(A, B\), and the problem seeks a constant value for their product \(x y\). Given the symmetry and the polynomial forms, the conjectured constant \(\boxed{5}\) emerges as it balances the structure of the polynomials and their roots.
