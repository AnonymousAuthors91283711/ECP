Given the structure of the enumerated answers and the divisibility conditions, the set describes integer pairs (a, b) satisfying specific divisibility properties for cubic expressions. These conditions imply that both expressions are divisible by certain linear factors, leading to the pattern that a and b are related through divisibility by (a+1) and (b-1). The pattern suggests the pairs are exactly those where a divides b^3 * a + 1, and b divides a^3 * b - 1, under the positivity constraints.
