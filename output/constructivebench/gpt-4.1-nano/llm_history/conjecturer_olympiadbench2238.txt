: {x : ℤ | (x^2 - 3) * (x^2 + 5) < 0} = olympiadbench2238_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℤ
The inequality ((x^2 - 3) * (x^2 + 5) < 0) holds when the two factors have opposite signs. Since (x^2 + 5) > 0 always, the negative product requires (x^2 - 3) < 0, i.e., x^2 < 3, so x ∈ (-√3, √3). As x ∈ ℤ, the integer x with x^2<3 are -1, 0, 1. 

Answer: <<<{x : ℤ | x ∈ [-1, 1]}>>>
