(hotimes : otimes = (λ a b : ℝ => a / b + b / a))
: otimes 4 8 = omnimath2878_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given hotimes = λ a b, a / b + b / a, we have otimes 4 8 = 4/8 + 8/4 = 1/2 + 2 = 2.5. General form: (a / b + b / a). Final answer: 5/2. Therefore, in Lean:

<<<(2 : ℝ)>>>
