Based on the pattern, the answer involves the degree of R (which is 3), leading to the polynomial Q's structure. Since q such that P.eval(q.eval x) satisfies the identity, and the degree of R is fixed at 3, the solutions q correspond to polynomials related to P scaled by degree 3 factors. The pattern suggests the answer involves the binomial coefficient for degree 3 and combinatorial factors.
