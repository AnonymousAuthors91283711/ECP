Ground Truth Answer: 766
Proposed Answer:  500
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the smallest natural number x such that for some w, the remaining work (after three quarters) can be covered by workers at rate (800 + x) per quarter-worker.

2. The total work is 1000w
3. First three quarters account for: 1000(w/4) + 900(w/4) + 800(w/4) = 2700(w/4)
4. Remaining work: 1000w - 2700(w/4) = (4000w - 2700w)/4 = 1300w/4 = 325w

5. The condition requires: (800 + x)(w/4) ≥ 325w
   Simplifying: 800 + x ≥ 1300 ⇒ x ≥ 500

The proposed answer (500) is the minimal x that satisfies the inequality, but the ground truth answer (766) suggests there might be additional constraints or a different interpretation. However, based on the given problem statement and straightforward calculation, 500 appears correct.

The discrepancy suggests either:
- The ground truth has additional unstated constraints
- There's a misinterpretation in the problem setup

Given only the information provided, the proposed answer (500) is correct by the given conditions.
