The sequence terms follow an arithmetic pattern with common difference d, and the sum of squares equality simplifies to find compatible d. Given a1=5, substituting into the equality suggests a unique d satisfying the quadratic equation that leads to the sequence terms. The consistent solution is when (a1 + 2d)^2 = (a1 + 3d)^2 + (a1 + 4d)^2, which simplifies to d = 0. 

Hence, the sequence is constant with terms all equal to 5.
