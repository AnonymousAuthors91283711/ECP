The number n must be palindromic in both base 10 and base 8, with n < 1000. The only such numbers are two-digit palindromes in base 10, i.e., 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, plus 1-digit and 3-digit palindromes that are also palindromic in base 8. Checking base 8 palindromes <=999, the largest is 585 (which is 111001 in base 8), but not achievable as a base 10 palindrome. The largest common palindrome in both bases under 1000 is 585. Since 585 is palindromic in base 10 and base 8, and is less than 1000, and no larger numbers satisfy all conditions, the greatest such n is 585. 

Final answer in Lean: 
<<<585>>>
