Given the conditions, the set of such \(a\) values that satisfy the existence of \(b\) making the set an exact range of a square root function corresponds to quadratic discriminant constraints. The pattern indicates that for each positive integer \(a = n\), the condition is met primarily for \(a=1\).  
Hence, the count of such \(a\) is 1.  
Final answer:  
<<<1>>>
