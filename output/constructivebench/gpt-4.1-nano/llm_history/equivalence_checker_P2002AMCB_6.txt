Ground Truth Answer: {(1, -2)}
Proposed Answer: { (a, b) | a * b + a + b = 0 }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all pairs (a,b) where both a and b are roots of the polynomial x² + a x + b, with a,b ≠ 0.

2. For a to be a root: a² + a·a + b = 0 → 2a² + b = 0
3. For b to be a root: b² + a·b + b = 0 → b(b + a + 1) = 0

Since b ≠ 0, we must have b + a + 1 = 0 → b = -a - 1

Substituting into the first equation:
2a² - a - 1 = 0 → (2a + 1)(a - 1) = 0 → a = 1 or a = -1/2

For a=1: b = -2 → (1, -2)
For a=-1/2: b = 1/2 - 1 = -1/2 → (-1/2, -1/2)

Now check the proposed answer { (a, b) | a * b + a + b = 0 }:
This is equivalent to b = -a/(a+1) when a ≠ -1

But from our solution, only (1,-2) and (-1/2,-1/2) should satisfy the condition. Let's test them:
- For (1,-2): 1*(-2) + 1 + (-2) = -2 +1 -2 = -3 ≠ 0 → Doesn't satisfy
- For (-1/2,-1/2): (-1/2)*(-1/2) + (-1/2) + (-1/2) = 1/4 -1 = -3/4 ≠ 0 → Doesn't satisfy

The proposed answer doesn't match the correct solution. The correct answer should be {(1, -2), (-1/2, -1/2)}.
