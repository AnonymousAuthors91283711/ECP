theorem omnimath3294 : 
  ¬ ∃ (a b : ℤ), (∃ (k : ℤ), a^5 * b + 3 = k^3) ∧ (∃ (m : ℤ), a * b^5 + 3 = m^3) ↔ omnimath3294_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Prop
Based on the pattern that the existentials involve fifth powers and cubes with a constant 3, and considering symmetry, the solution likely involves the non-existence of such integer solutions, i.e., the statement simplifies to false. 

Final answer in Lean:
<<<False>>>
