The pattern suggests that the minimal n satisfying the polynomial relation involves conditions on divisibility, particularly tailored to the degrees and structure of the involved polynomials. The key constraints imply n must be minimal for which (X + 1)^n - 1 is divisible by (X^2 + 1) up to an element involving 3 times some polynomial. Since the polynomial (X + 1)^n - 1 modulo (X^2 + 1) reveals that divisibility conditions depend on powers of -1, which relate to parity, the minimal n satisfying these conditions is 4, corresponding to the first even power that turns (X + 1)^n - 1 into the desired form.
