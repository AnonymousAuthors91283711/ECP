abbrev omnimath3201_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3201 :
  (50 * 76 - 40 * 80) / (50 - 40) = omnimath3201_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The expression simplifies to ((50 * 76 - 40 * 80) / (50 - 40)), which is a linear interpolation between two points; the numerator simplifies to (3800 - 3200) = 600, and the denominator to 10, giving 600 / 10 = 60. 

Therefore, the answer is a constant 60. 

<<<60>>>
