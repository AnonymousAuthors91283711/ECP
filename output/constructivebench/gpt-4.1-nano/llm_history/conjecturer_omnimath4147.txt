The functions in F satisfy the functional equation f(x + f y) = f x + f y, which restricts f to affine functions of the form f(z) = t * z. Therefore, all functions have the property f z = q * z iff t = q. The set of such q is all real q associated with affine functions, i.e., all q ∈ ℚ. Hence, the answer is the entire ℚ set.
