The problem describes preferences among girls and songs with certain subset restrictions, requiring the count of such functions. The pattern suggests the total counts relate to permutations avoiding fixed points and involving pairs. Based on the enumeration pattern, the total number is 12. Therefore, the concise closed form expression is:

<<<12>>>
