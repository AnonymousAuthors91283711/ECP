Ground Truth Answer: 4 - 2 * Real.sqrt 3
Proposed Answer: (2 : ℝ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the least value of |x-y| + |y-z| under the given constraints:
   - 0 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ 4
   - x² + 2 = y²
   - y² + 2 = z²

2. From the equations:
   - y = √(x² + 2)
   - z = √(y² + 2) = √(x² + 4)

3. The expression to minimize is:
   |x - y| + |y - z| = (y - x) + (z - y) = z - x (since x ≤ y ≤ z)

4. So we need to minimize √(x² + 4) - x

5. The minimum occurs at the maximum possible x value, which is when z = 4:
   √(x² + 4) = 4 ⇒ x² = 12 ⇒ x = 2√3 (since x ≥ 0)

6. Then the minimum value is 4 - 2√3 ≈ 0.5358

The proposed answer is 2, which is clearly different from the correct answer 4 - 2√3. The proposed answer is incorrect.
