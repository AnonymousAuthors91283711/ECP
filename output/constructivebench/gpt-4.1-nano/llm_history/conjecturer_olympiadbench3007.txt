Given the pattern in the digit transformations and the properties of modulo 1000, the answer depends mainly on the last two digits and the behavior mod 1000. The pattern suggests that digits 0 and 5 map to 1, and the product cyclically stabilizes due to the repeated digit transformations. The final product modulo 1000, considering the transformations over the range 1 to 2019, converges to 625 as the invariant.
