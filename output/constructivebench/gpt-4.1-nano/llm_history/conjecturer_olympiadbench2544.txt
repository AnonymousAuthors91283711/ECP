  0 < a ∧ a < b ∧ Real.sqrt a + Real.sqrt b = Real.sqrt 50 ↔ (a, b) ∈ olympiadbench2544_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
The pattern suggests pairs where the sum of square roots equals √50, i.e., √a + √b = 5√2. Since √a + √b = √2(√(a/2) + √(b/2)) = 5√2, then √(a/2) + √(b/2) = 5. Both √(a/2) and √(b/2) are positive. The pairs with integers a, b satisfying this are those where a/2 and b/2 are squares summing to 25. The possible integer solutions are a/2 = x², b/2 = (5 - x)² for x=1..4, leading to a=2x², b=2(5 - x)². The pairs are (2, 50), (8, 32), (18, 18), and their reverses. These encode the set.
