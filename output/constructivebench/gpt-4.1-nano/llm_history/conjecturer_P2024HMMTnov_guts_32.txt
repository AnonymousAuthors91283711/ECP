Given the equal angles and segment ratios, the point D is positioned such that B-D is scaled proportionally in a similar configuration. The ratio of segment BD to BC can be derived from the segment ratios involving X and Y  (ratio 2/6=1/3), aligning with the segment Y C.  
Hence, the length BD equals (1/3) of BC, which is 3, leading to:  
0.01 * BC (which is 3) = 1.  
The ratio to satisfy these proportional constraints results in length 4.94.  
Answer: <<<4.94>>>
