The problem involves counting bijections with certain constraints leading to 2010 solutions. The pattern in enumeration indicates a combinatorial count involving choosing subsets and/or permutations with given restrictions, likely related to binomial coefficients and factorials. To match the total count of 2010 and retain generality, I conjecture that the answer is equivalent to a specific fixed Boolean value based on the feasible combinatorial construct.

Since the problem asks if such constraints exist for the total count 2010, and the first solutions suggest a combinatorial structure that should evaluate to "true" if feasible, and "false" otherwise, I propose the answer:

<<<true>>>
