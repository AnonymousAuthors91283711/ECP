  (ha : StrictMono a ∧ (∀ n : ℕ, ∃ i j k : ℕ, n = a i + 2 * a j + 4 * a k ∧
    (∀ i' j' k' : ℕ, n = a i' + 2 * a j' + 4 * a k' → (i = i' ∧ j = j' ∧ k = k')))) :
  a 1998 = omnimath4144_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests uniqueness in representation of n as i + 2j + 4k with minimal or standard coefficients. Since the problem shows a unique decomposition for n in terms of increasing a, the explicit form would naturally be the sum of the base components for n = 1998, represented as 1998 = i + 2j + 4k with minimal k. The only consistent constant coefficient pattern that accounts for all such n is 1, 2, and 4, akin to binary representation. 

Final Answer:
<<<177 + 44 * 2 + 7 * 4>>>
