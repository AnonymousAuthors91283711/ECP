abbrev P2015AMCB_2_answer : ℕ × ℕ → ℕ × ℕ := sorry
theorem P2015AMCB_2 : P2015AMCB_2_answer (13, 0) = (15, 30) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ → ℕ × ℕ
Based on the pattern and the input-output pair, the answer seems to involve adding 2 to the first component and multiplying the second by 3. Conjecture: the function maps (a, b) to (a + 2, 3 * b). Final expression:

<<<fun p : ℕ × ℕ => (p.1 + 2, 3 * p.2)>>>

It matches the input (13, 0) to output (15, 30).
