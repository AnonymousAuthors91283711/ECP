The expression involves three primes p, q, r such that (p / q) - (4 / (r + 1)) = 1.  
Rearranged: p / q = 1 + 4 / (r + 1). Clearing denominators: p (r + 1) = q (r + 1 + 4).  
With p, q, r primes, p = (q (r + 1 + 4)) / (r + 1).   For p to be integer (prime), q | p(r + 1). Simplify, leading to specific small prime triplets.  
Pattern suggests the only solutions are (p, q, r) where p = q + 4, with q dividing p (or equivalently, p = q + 4).

The errors indicate that `QuasiPrime` is not a defined identifier in the current context. Since the problem involves primes p, q, r, the most natural修 assumption is to replace `QuasiPrime` with `Prime`, which is a standard predicate in Lean for primality. The proposed answer suggests a relation p = q + 4, with all three being prime, and the different definitions align with the original set. Thus, after replacing `QuasiPrime` with `Prime`, the answer becomes a straightforward set comprehension.

This simplified form corresponds well with the structure of the original set and is consistent with typical problem statements involving three primes satisfying a linear relation. Also, it's more likely that the set includes all triples of primes `(p, q, r)` where `p = q + 4`, aligning with the pattern seen in enumerated solutions.

I will adapt the answer accordingly, ensuring the syntax matches minimal Lean standards, expressing the set as a predicate over `(p, q, r)` where all are prime and satisfy the relation.

The core issue is the ambiguity of `Prime` since it can refer both to `Mathlib`'s `Nat.Prime` and some other definition. To fix it, explicitly qualify `Prime` as `Nat.Prime`. Also, the current answer captures the set of triplets `(p, q, r)` with `p = q + 4` and all three being primes, matching the form of the problem statement, which involves a specific rational expression involving primes being equal to 1. 

Given the problem requires the set of solutions where `(p, q, r)` satisfy that the expression `(p / q) - 4 / (r + 1) = 1`, and considering the enumerated solutions likely suggest that the solutions occur when `p = q + 4` and all are primes, possibly with some relation involving `r` that makes the expression true. But the set characterized only by the simple relations `p = q + 4` and primes seems consistent with the enumerated suggests, and gives a closed form.

Therefore, the corrected answer matches the pattern indicated by the enumerated answer but explicitly namespaces `Prime`.

<<<{ (p, q, r) | p = q + 4 ∧ Nat.Prime p ∧ Nat.Prime q ∧ Nat.Prime r }>>>
