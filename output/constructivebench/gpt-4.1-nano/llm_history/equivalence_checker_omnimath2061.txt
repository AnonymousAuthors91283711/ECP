Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 201
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n where:
   - n > 0
   - (n + 1)/(2n + 1) < 1/100

2. Let's solve the inequality:
   (n + 1)/(2n + 1) < 1/100
   => 100(n + 1) < 2n + 1
   => 100n + 100 < 2n + 1
   => 98n < -99
   => n < -99/98 ≈ -1.01

3. This suggests there are NO positive integers satisfying the inequality, which contradicts both answers.

However, if we consider the inequality might be:
   (n + 1)/(2n + 1) > 1/100 (flipped inequality sign)

Then solving would give:
   n > -99/98
Which is always true for positive n, making the smallest solution n=1.

Neither 6 nor 201 satisfy the original inequality (both make the left side > 1/100), and the inequality appears to have no solution.

Given this analysis:
<<<False>>>
