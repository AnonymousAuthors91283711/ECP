The problem involves decomposing the given product into coprime factors. Given T² = 26, T = √26, raising to the 20th power yields (√26)^{20} = (26)^{10}. The product simplifies to (26)^{10} * 210^{12}. To get coprime (a, b), distribute prime factors of 26 and 210 alternately, pairing factors to produce coprime integers. The minimal pairings lead to the minimal common factors. The pattern suggests the answer is related to the total exponents and prime factorizations.

Since:
- 26 = 2 * 13
- 210 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7

and their gcd is 1, the minimal coprime factors are obtained by grouping prime powers.

A plausible closed form is:

<<<(2 ^ (10 + 12)) * 13 ^ (10) * 3 ^ (12) * 5 ^ (12) * 7 ^ (12)>>>

which corresponds to the product of the powers, considering the coprime nature, scaled appropriately.

Final answer:  
<<<(2 ^ 22) * 13 ^ 10 * 3 ^ 12 * 5 ^ 12 * 7 ^ 12>>>
