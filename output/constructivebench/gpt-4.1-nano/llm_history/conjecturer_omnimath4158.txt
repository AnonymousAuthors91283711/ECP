    lines.Nonempty := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The conditions imply a finite set of lines, each with 3 elements, such that any two lines intersect in exactly one element, and each pair of distinct elements from ℕ is contained in exactly one line. This describes a finite affine plane of order 2, consisting of 7 points and 7 lines, with each point lying in exactly 3 lines (since each point intersects with all other points in exactly one line).

Thus, n must be 7, corresponding to the points of this affine plane. The size of the set of all points involved is 7.

Final answer:
<<<{ 7 }>>>
