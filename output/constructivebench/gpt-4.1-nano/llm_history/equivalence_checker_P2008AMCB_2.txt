Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a 4×4 matrix M where each entry M i j is defined as M₀₀ + j + 7i.
2. We then create a modified matrix M' where rows 1 and 3 are reversed.
3. We need to calculate the absolute difference between the sums of the two diagonals of M'.

The ground truth answer is 4, which is correct because:
- The main diagonal sum (diag1) will be M₀₀ + M₁₂ + M₂₂ + M₃₀
- The other diagonal sum (diag2) will be M₀₃ + M₁₁ + M₂₁ + M₃₃
- The difference simplifies to |(M₁₂ - M₁₁) + (M₃₀ - M₃₃)| = |1 + (-3)| = 4

The proposed answer is 7, which doesn't match this calculation. The difference comes from not correctly accounting for how the row reversals affect the diagonal sums.
