theorem omnimath3390
: (∃ d : ℕ, 10 * d + 8 = 528 ∧ 2 * d = omnimath3390_answer) ∧ (∀ d : ℕ, 10 * d + 8 = 528 → 2 * d = omnimath3390_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the enumeration, the unique value satisfying 10 * d + 8 = 528 gives d = 52, then 2 * d = 104.  
Final answer:  
<<<104>>>
