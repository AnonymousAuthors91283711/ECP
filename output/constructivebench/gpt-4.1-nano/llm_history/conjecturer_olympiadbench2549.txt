The equation involves iterated function f(x) = x^2 - 2x, and the condition f(f(f x)) = 3. The pattern suggests a focus on roots of related quadratic equations and their compositions. Based on the iterates and the nature of the quadratics, the solutions correspond to points generated by roots of the quadratic x^2 - 2x - c = 0 for specific constants c that satisfy the iterated relations. After analyzing the pattern, the set of solutions simplifies to the fixed points of f^3, which are roots of a polynomial derived from iterated substitution, ultimately found to be certain real roots related to ±√2. 

Therefore, the solutions are the roots of the cubic polynomial involved, which simplifies to the set containing ±√2.
