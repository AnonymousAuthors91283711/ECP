Ground Truth Answer: {k | Even k}
Proposed Answer: { n : ℕ | n % 2 = 0 }
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The ground truth answer {k | Even k} and the proposed answer { n : ℕ | n % 2 = 0 } are equivalent. Both are describing the set of all natural numbers that are even (divisible by 2). The first uses the predicate "Even" while the second uses the modulo operation, but they express the same condition.
