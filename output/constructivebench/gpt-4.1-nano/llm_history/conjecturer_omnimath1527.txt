The problem asks for the set of all n > 0 such that every integer k has a solution a with a³ + a ≡ k mod n.  

For this to hold, the map a ↦ a³ + a mod n must cover all residues mod n, which is true when n divides 2.  

Thus, the set is the set of all positive divisors of 2.  

Final answer: <<<{1, 2}>>>
