theorem omnimath1172 :
  (∑ f : Fin 2021 → Fin 2021, 
    (Finset.image (fun n => iterate f 2021 n) univ).card) % 2017 = omnimath1172_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The expression analyzes the sum over all functions from Fin 2021 to itself, involving iterates and set images, and then modulo 2017. Pattern suggests that the sum simplifies to the product of the number of functions and some combinatorial count. Since the functions are from a finite set to itself, the total functions are 2021^{2021}, and the sum over all function iterates points to the total of fixed points or the number of functions with certain properties, which is 2021^{2021}. Thus, the sum mod 2017 simplifies to 1, given Fermat's little theorem.
