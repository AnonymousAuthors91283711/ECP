abbrev omnimath1735_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1735 :
  let n := (2014 : ℝ)
  let p k := (∏ i in Finset.range k, (n - i)/n) * (k/n)
  let E := ∑' k, k * p k
  round (100 * E) = omnimath1735_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The expected value E resembles a known sum involving the harmonic numbers. As n grows large, the sum converges to 2. Multiplying by 100 yields approximately 200. Therefore, the final answer simplified and normalized is 200. 

<<<200>>>
