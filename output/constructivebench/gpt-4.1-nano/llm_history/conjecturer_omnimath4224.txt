Based on pattern analysis, the iteration appears to involve a midpoint division and a transformation that reduces the problem. The minimal k corresponds to halving the distance or a similar divided step.

Conjectured answer: the expression involves halving the interval length and doubling the iteration count.

<<<fun a b => 2 * (b - a + 1) / 2 + 1>>>

This fits the pattern of iterating towards zero via successive halving.
