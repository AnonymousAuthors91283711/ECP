  ∃! n : ℕ, 0 < n ∧ Nat.lcm n 18 = 180 ∧ Nat.gcd n 45 = 15 ∧ (Nat.digits 10 n).sum = P2022AMCA_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The conditions imply n is a multiple of 15 (from gcd n 45 = 15) and divides 180 (from lcm n 18 = 180). Since gcd 15 and lcm 180 relate via n, and the sum of digits of n should be consistent, the candidate is n = 45, which satisfies all.
