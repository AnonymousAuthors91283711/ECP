Ground Truth Answer: (559 - 540, 540)
Proposed Answer: (1, 90)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the maximum value of a certain expression under given constraints. The ground truth answer is given as (559-540, 540) which simplifies to (19, 540).

2. The proposed answer is (1, 90), which represents the fraction 1/90.

3. Comparing the values:
   - Ground truth: 19/540 ≈ 0.035185
   - Proposed: 1/90 ≈ 0.011111

4. These are clearly different values, with the ground truth being larger than the proposed answer.

5. The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the "IsGreatest" condition in the theorem since there exists a larger value (19/540).
