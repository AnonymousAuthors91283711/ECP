The pattern indicates the maximum value occurs when the function attains its largest permissible differences at each step, scaling with the total number of steps, which sums to 2019. The maximum value is achieved with a linear growth, summing the maximum possible increases at each level. The total increase equals the sum from 0 to 2019, scaled by 1, leading to the closed-form:

<<<2019 * (2019 + 1) / 2>>>
