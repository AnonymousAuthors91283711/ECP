Let's analyze the problem: It involves numbers \( n \) from 1000 to 9999, with digit-based inequalities depending on parity—digits increase if odd, decrease if even. The given enumerated answers suggest the answer counts specific numbers following pattern constraints.

Pattern recognition implies the sequence counts four-digit numbers with specific alternating digit inequalities based on parity, enforcing the pattern: odd digits increasing to the right, even digits decreasing to the right. The total count resembles a combinatorial problem involving arrangements fitting these parity rules, likely leading to a small fixed number.

From the enumerated answers, the consistent pattern indicates the total count is 36. This aligns with the count of numbers satisfying these digit-parity inequalities.

Therefore, the final count is a constant, 36.

<<<36>>>
