Ground Truth Answer: fun k m n => 0
Proposed Answer: fun k m n => (m + n)! / (k * (m + n + 1) * (n - m)! * (k - 1)! )
Let me analyze this carefully.

1. The problem is about proving an equality between a sum of rational terms and some closed-form expression.

2. The ground truth answer is simply 0 for all k, m, n.

3. The proposed answer is a non-zero rational expression involving factorials.

4. For the proposed answer to be equivalent to the ground truth, it would need to evaluate to 0 for all valid inputs (k > 0, m ≥ k, n ≥ m).

5. The proposed answer's denominator contains (n - m)! which would be 0! = 1 when n = m, making the expression non-zero in that case.

6. The numerator (m + n)! is always positive for m, n ≥ 0, and the denominator terms are all positive for valid inputs.

7. Therefore, the proposed answer is not identically zero and cannot match the ground truth.
