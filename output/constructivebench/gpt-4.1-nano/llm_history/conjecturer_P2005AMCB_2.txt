    x / 100 * x = 4 ↔ x = P2005AMCB_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the equation \( \frac{x}{100} \times x = 4 \), which simplifies to \( \frac{x^2}{100} = 4 \), solving for \( x \) yields \( x^2 = 400 \), so \( x = \pm 20 \). Since \( hx : 0 < x \), only the positive root applies: \( x = 20 \). 

Final answer: <<<20>>>
