The pattern suggests counting all functions from a 3-element set to a 10×10 grid with pairwise distinct entries in both components. There are 10 choices for each coordinate in the first component, then 9 remaining choices for the second, similarly for the second component, resulting in the product of decremented choices for both components across 3 elements. 

The total number of such functions is (10 × 10) * (9 × 9) * (8 × 8). Dividing by the total permutations accounts for order, and the structure resembles a permutation of 3 items into a 10×10 grid without repetition in coordinates:

(10×10) P 3 for the first components, and likewise for second components, combined.

Expressed as a closed-form with factorials:

(10×10) P 3 * (10×10) P 3 = ((10×10)! / (10×10 - 3)!)^2.

Since the question asks for a rational number, the count is:

(10×10) * (9×10) * (8×10), considering the fixed positions as choices.

**Therefore, the final answer:**

<<<(10 * 10) * (9 * 10) * (8 * 10)>>>
