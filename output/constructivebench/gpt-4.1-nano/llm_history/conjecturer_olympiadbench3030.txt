The goal is to find an explicit simplified value for x + z based on the provided equations. Given the relations, x and y satisfy quadratic forms and linear relations, which suggest a constant or an expression involving known constants. The pattern in the enumerated answers indicates the expression simplifies to a straightforward rational number. 

Conjecture: x + z simplifies to a rational number derived from the given constants, specifically 5 + (-7) = -2, indicating the answer is -2.
