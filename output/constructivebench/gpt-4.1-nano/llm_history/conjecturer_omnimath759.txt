The problem asks for the greatest n ≤ 200 such that for all k ≤ 200, |n - X| ≤ |k - X| with \( X = 3 + \frac{107 + 99n}{200} \).  
This resembles an extremal property where n maximizes the minimal distance to X among numbers ≤ 200.  
Given the pattern in enumerated answers, likely extremal n occurs at the boundary or where the difference condition tightens, most plausibly at n = 200, since the function grows with n.  
Answer should be the boundary value n=200.  

<<<200>>>
