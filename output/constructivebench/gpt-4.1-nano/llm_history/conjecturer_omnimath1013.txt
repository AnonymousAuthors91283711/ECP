theorem omnimath1013 : 
  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | (n : ℝ) * (4/3 * π * 4^3) ≤ (4/3 * π * 10^3)} omnimath1013_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The inequality compares volumes scaled by 4/3 * π, with radius 4 and 10. Since volume proportional to r³, the greatest n satisfying n*(4/3*π*4³) ≤ (4/3*π*10³) simplifies to n*4³ ≤ 10³, or n ≤ (10/4)³ = (5/2)³. The greatest integer n satisfying this is n = 12 (since 12*4³=12*64=768 ≤ 1000=10³). 

Answer: <<<12>>>
