    |x₁ - x₂| = P2023AMCA_6_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The given conditions suggest symmetry and a relationship involving logs and sums. Since logb 2 x₁ + logb 2 x₂ = 4, implying x₁ x₂ = 2⁴ = 16, and x₁ + x₂ = 12, the difference |x₁ - x₂| is tied to these numbers. Solving for difference using quadratic roots yields 8. 

Final answer: <<<8>>>
