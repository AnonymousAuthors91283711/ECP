The set of positive integers (a, b) satisfying a^2 + b^2 = 50 are (1, 7), (7, 1), (5, 5). The sum of minimal a + b for these pairs is 1+7=8, 7+1=8, 5+5=10; the minimal is 8. The only pairs with sum = 8 are (1, 7) and (7, 1). Considering the problem's requirement for a natural number (probably a count or index), the answer in a closed form should reflect this minimal sum or count. Since the enumeration shows only two such pairs, the total count is 2, but the problem asks for a natural number answer that encapsulates the solution set. So, the minimal sum is 8, and the total pairs are 2. The answer expected is the total number of pairs, which is 2.  

Given the context, the answer is 2.
