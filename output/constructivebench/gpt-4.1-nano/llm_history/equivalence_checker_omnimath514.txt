Ground Truth Answer: {(-1, 1)}
Proposed Answer: {(x, y) | y = -x}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all real pairs (x,y) that satisfy the equation (x + y)² = (x + 1)(y - 1).

2. The ground truth answer is {(-1, 1)}, meaning only the single point (-1,1) satisfies the equation.

3. The proposed answer is {(x, y) | y = -x}, suggesting all points on the line y = -x satisfy the equation.

Let's test the proposed answer:
- For any (x, -x), the equation becomes (x - x)² = (x + 1)(-x - 1) ⇒ 0 = -(x + 1)²
- This only holds when x = -1 ⇒ y = 1
- So only (-1,1) satisfies it, not all points on y = -x

The proposed answer incorrectly suggests all points on y = -x satisfy the equation, when in fact only (-1,1) does.
