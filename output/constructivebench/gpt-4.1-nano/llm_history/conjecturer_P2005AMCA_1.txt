theorem P2005AMCA_1
(x y : ℝ)
(hxy : 2 = 0.1 * x ∧ 2 = 0.2 * y)
: x - y = P2005AMCA_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The enumerated answers suggest that with given relations, \( x = 20 \) and \( y = 10 \), so \( x - y = 10 \). Recognizing these as solutions to the linear equations, the final answer can be expressed as the constant difference. 

<<<10>>>
