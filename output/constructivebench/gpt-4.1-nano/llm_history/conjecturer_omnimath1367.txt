Since the equation \(x^3 + 4x = 8\) suggests a root at \(x = 2\), and testing this yields \(8 + 8 = 16\) which is not 8, but considering standard polynomial roots and symmetrical transformations, the pattern indicates a constant outcome at 128 for solutions satisfying the cubic relation. Given the pattern in enumeration, the consistent answer for \(x\) satisfying the cubic is determined by cubic root relations with scaling factors. Thus, the closed-form answer, independent of \(x\), is \(128\).

  omnimath1367_answer x = 128 := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: λ x : ℝ, 128. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 45, which is at ", 128" in "abbrev omnimath1367_answer : ℝ → ℝ := λ x : ℝ, 128", there is an error: unexpected token ','; expected '↦', '=>'.
. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
The error stems from the incorrect syntax in the definition. In Lean, function expressions should use `=>` instead of `,`. The corrected version of the proposed answer is `λ x : ℝ => 128`.

Given the problem statement and the proof sketch, the intended answer seems to be a constant function returning 128 for all x satisfying `x^3 + 4 * x = 8`. Since the provided answer is simply a constant (128), and the condition on x is given, the function can be correctly defined with proper syntax as:

```lean
λ x : ℝ => 128
```

This matches the expected function type `ℝ → ℝ` and resolves the syntax error.

---

**Final Answer:**

<<<λ x : ℝ => 128>>>

**Explanation:** I replaced the comma with `=>` to conform to Lean's syntax for lambda expressions, ensuring the function is a constant 128 over ℝ.
