  (1 + ∑ k in Finset.range 4, 11 * (11 - k) * Nat.descFactorial 11 k) % 1000 = P2019AIMEI_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sum involves descending factorials and terms related to 11, hinting at combinatorial identities. The pattern suggests a simplification leading to a constant value modulo 1000, likely related to factorial terms and their combinatorial properties. Since enumerated answers are given, the pattern indicates a specific constant involving 11's factorial components, simplified modulo 1000.
