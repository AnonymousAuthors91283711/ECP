abbrev omnimath4365_answer : Bool := sorry
theorem omnimath4365 : 
  ∃ (x y : ℤ), (2 * x + 1)^3 + 1 = y^4 ↔ omnimath4365_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Bool
The pattern suggests that the equation (2x + 1)^3 + 1 = y^4 has no integer solutions because the form is incompatible with perfect fourth powers, and the enumerated answer implies a false scenario. Therefore, the answer is false for all x, y.

<<< false >>>
