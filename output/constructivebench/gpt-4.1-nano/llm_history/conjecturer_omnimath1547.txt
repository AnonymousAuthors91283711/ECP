The pattern suggests that functions satisfying f(x) * f(y) = f(x - y) resemble exponential functions of the form f(x) = c^{x}, with c > 0. Given f(2017) = y, the set of all such possible y's is all positive real numbers c^{2017}. Eliminating parameters, the set is all y > 0 such that y = c^{2017} for some c > 0, equivalently, all y > 0. 

Final answer in Lean:

<<<{ y : ℝ | 0 < y }>>>
