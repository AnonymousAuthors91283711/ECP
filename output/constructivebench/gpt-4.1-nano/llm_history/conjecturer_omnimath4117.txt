The problem involves pairing elements in an even square grid such that each true marking connects neighboring points with minimal total markings. Analyzing the pattern suggests the minimal number of markings corresponds to a perfect pairing of nodes along the grid's structure, which is proportional to the total number of nodes minus the number of pairs in a perfect matching: \(\frac{n^2}{2}\). 

Final answer: <<<fun n => n * n / 2>>>
