Given the pattern and the summation involved, the sum of n/k over k in 1..n appears to be related to the harmonic series scaled by n, which influences the parity pattern. The key insight from enumerations suggests an alternating pattern linked to powers of 2, specifically for the range 1..100. The answer converges to 50, as roughly half the values produce odd sums.
