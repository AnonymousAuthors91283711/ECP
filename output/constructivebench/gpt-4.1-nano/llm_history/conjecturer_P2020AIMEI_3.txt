The pattern in the enumerated answers suggests that the minimal N satisfying both conditions involves choosing the smallest a, b, c within the given bounds to minimize N. Given the constraints, select the smallest values:

- a = 0 (less than 8)
- b = 0 (less than 8)
- c = 0 (less than 8)

then compute N:

N = a * 11^2 + b * 11 + c = 0 * 121 + 0 * 11 + 0 = 0

and N = 1 * 8^3 + b * 8^2 + c * 8 + a = 512 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 512

But since the minimal N must satisfy both equations, and the first is 0 and the second is 512, no solution exists for both being equal unless the intersection is empty, or the minimal N equals the common value.

Alternatively, choosing minimal a, b, c to match both:

a=0, b=0, c=0:

- N from second expression: 512

- N from first: 0

No, so pick larger values that satisfy both.

The smallest a > 0, since both are positive:

Test a=0, b=0, c= a*11^2 + b*11 + c. So, small the minimal N possible.

Indeed, the only possible N common in both representations is when these expressions equal. When simplified with minimal variables, the intersection occurs at N= 0 from the first expression if variables are zero. For the second expression, the minimum is at c=0, b=0, a=0 giving N=0, but since c<11, a<11, the lowest possible a,b,c are zero.

Hence, the minimal N satisfying both is zero.

But as per the problem, N is determined by the expressions equating, and considering the constraints, the minimal N that satisfies the equalities given both are within the bounds is obtained with:

a=0, b=0, c=0: N=0, which is consistent with the first expression, and then the second gives N=512. Not equal.

Thus, the minimal N satisfying both expressions is:

Find the minimal N when the two expressions are equal: 

a * 121 + b * 11 + c = 8^3 + b * 64 + c * 8 + a

which simplifies to:

a * 121 + b * 11 + c = 512 + 64 * b + 8 * c + a

Rearranged:

(121 - 1) a + (11 - 64) b + (c - 8 c) = 512

which is:

120 a - 53 b - 7 c = 512

Subject to a<8, b<8, c<8. The minimal N with these parameters satisfying the equation occurs at minimal a,b,c satisfying the above.

Choosing a=4:

120*4=480

Now, equation:

480 - 53 b - 7 c = 512

-53 b - 7 c= 32

Try b=0:

-7 c=32-480=-448 => c=-32 (invalid)

b=1:

-53 - 7 c=32 - 480 = -448

-7 c= -448+53= -395 => c= 395/7 ≈ 56.43 (invalid, c<8)

Similarly, other b values do not satisfy; testing a=1, a=2, etc., will yield higher N.

Alternatively, choosing a=8 (max), but a<8, so not possible.

Given the complexity, and the pattern from enumerations, the minimal possible N occurs at a=0, b=0, c=0, leading N=0 in the first case, and 512 in the second, which are incompatible.

Therefore, the minimal N satisfying the conditions is the least N such that:

N = a * 121 + b * 11 + c = 1 * 512 + b * 64 + c *8 + a

which reduces to:

a*121 + b*11 + c = 512 + 64b + 8c + a

→ (121 -1)a + (11 -64)b + (c -8c) = 512

→ 120a - 53b - 7c=512

Trying a=4:

120*4=480

→ -53b -7c=32

b=0:

-7 c=32-(-53*0)=32

c=-32/7 invalid as c>0 

b=1:

-53 -7 c=32 - 120= -88

-7 c= -88+53= -35

c=5

b=1,c=5

Check c<8: yes.

Compute N:

N= a*121 + b*11 + c= 4*121 + 1*11 +5= 484+11+5=500

Similarly, check other b:

b=0, c=4:

-7*4= -28

-53*0=0

Sum: 32

Equation:

-7c=32 → c=-32/7 invalid.

b=2:

-106 -7 c=32- 120= -88

-7 c= -88+106= 18

c= -18/7 invalid.

b=1, c=5:

N=500 (as above). This is valid and less than previous options.

Thus, N=500 is a candidate.

Hence, the minimal answer is N=500.

Therefore, in the lean code, the answer is:

<<<500>>>
