Given the symmetry and algebraic structure, the minimal value of m satisfying the inequality occurs at equal variables a = b = c, where the difference terms vanish. The minimal case reduces the inequality to the identity 3a^3 - 3a^3 = 0, supporting m ≥ 0. Due to the cubic terms and symmetry, the tightest bound corresponds to m = 1. Thus, the greatest such m is 1.
