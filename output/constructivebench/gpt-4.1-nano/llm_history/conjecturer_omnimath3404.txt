abbrev omnimath3404_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3404 : 
  (1/2 * 1/2 + 1/3 * 1/2) = omnimath3404_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The pattern suggests summing the products of reciprocals of integers. The sum (1/2 * 1/2 + 1/3 * 1/2) simplifies to (1/4 + 1/6). The common denominator is 12, so the sum is (3/12 + 2/12) = 5/12. Thus, the closed-form answer is 1/2 * 1/3 + 1/2 * 1/2, which simplifies to 1/6 + 1/4 = 5/12.

<<<(1 / 6) + (1 / 4)>>>
