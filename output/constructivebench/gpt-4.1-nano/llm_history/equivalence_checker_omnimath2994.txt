  natalie = omnimath2994_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 176
Proposed Answer: 171
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us:
   - jiayin = 161 (given)
   - Average of natalie, harpreet, and jiayin is 171

2. Calculation:
   (natalie + harpreet + jiayin)/3 = 171
   => natalie + harpreet + 161 = 513
   => natalie + harpreet = 352

3. The ground truth answer claims natalie = 176, but this would imply harpreet = 176 as well (since 176 + 176 = 352). However, the problem doesn't provide any additional constraints to uniquely determine natalie's value.

4. The proposed answer of 171 is incorrect because:
   - It doesn't satisfy natalie + harpreet = 352
   - It seems to be just repeating the average value

The ground truth answer of 176 is one possible solution (when natalie = harpreet), but not the only possible one. The proposed answer of 171 is mathematically incorrect.
