theorem olympiadbench2343 :
  ∃! k : ℕ, 2 ≤ k ∧ k ≤ 40 ∧ (k * (k - 1) : ℚ) / (40 * 39 : ℚ) = 5 / 12 ∧ k = olympiadbench2343_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The value of k satisfying the probability ratio simplifies to k(k - 1) / (40 * 39) = 5/12. Solving yields k = 10, which meets bounds. 

<<<10>>>
