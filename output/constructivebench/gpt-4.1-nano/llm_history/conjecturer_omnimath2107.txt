theorem omnimath2107 (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) :
  totient (2019 * n) = totient (n^2) ↔ n ∈ omnimath2107_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests identifying n such that totient(2019 * n) equals totient(n^2). Since totient(n^2) depends on n's prime factors, and 2019 is fixed, solutions involve divisibility and factorization properties. The enumerated set likely reflects divisors n satisfying specific prime powers or coprimality conditions with 2019. Considering 2019 = 3 * 673, solutions where n shares these primes as factors to certain powers balance the totients. 

Final answer in set form: 

<<<{n | ∃ k ≥ 0, n = 3^k * 673^k}>>>
