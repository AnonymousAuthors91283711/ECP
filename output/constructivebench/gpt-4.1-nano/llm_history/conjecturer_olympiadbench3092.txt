Given T=5, the divisors d satisfy d = m^3 dividing 20^4 * 11^5. Factor 20^4 = 2^8 * 5^4. The divisors of 20^4 * 11^5 are formed from exponents of 2, 5, 11 with constraints: 0 ≤ a ≤ 8, 0 ≤ b ≤ 4, 0 ≤ c ≤ 5, with d = 2^a * 5^b * 11^c, and d = m^3 implies a, b, c divisible by 3. Exponents: a ∈ {0,3,6}, b ∈ {0,3}, c ∈ {0,3} (c cannot be 6 as max c is 5). The total count of such m^3 divisors is the product of options for a, b, c:

Number of options: a=3, b=2, c=2.

Final answer: <<<6>>>
