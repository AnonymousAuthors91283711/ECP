The subset T with product 80 and sum 20 indicates choosing 4, 5, and 1 for sum and product. Since 5 is not in S, check other combinations. Only subset {1, 4, 20} yields product 80 and sum 25 > 20. Now, subset {1, 4, 16} product 64 < 80; {2, 4, 20} sum=26≠20; {2, 4, 16} sum=22≠20; {2, 8, 10} but 10 not in S; {4, 8, 20} product=640>80; {1, 8, 20} sum=29≠20. The only subset with sum 20 and product 80 is {1, 4, 20}. Sum = 25, not 20, so no such subset exists. Therefore, the sum is 20, the sum of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 20, but only subset {20} with T size 1, not 3. So, no such T, the sum is 20.
