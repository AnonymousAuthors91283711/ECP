Ground Truth Answer: 990
Proposed Answer: 10
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest value of a certain difference between infima of two functions f and g, where a,b,c are distinct integers from 1 to 11.

2. The functions are:
   - f(x) = a(x-b)(x-c)
   - g(x) = a(x-b)(x+c)

3. The ground truth answer is 990, which suggests this is the maximum possible difference between the infima of these functions under the given constraints.

4. The proposed answer is 10, which is much smaller than 990.

The proposed answer of 10 is clearly incorrect as it's significantly smaller than the ground truth answer of 990. The difference between these values is too large to be considered equivalent or close.
