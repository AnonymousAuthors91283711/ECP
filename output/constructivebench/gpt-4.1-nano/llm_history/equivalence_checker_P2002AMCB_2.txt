abbrev P2002AMCB_2_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem P2002AMCB_2 (x : ℝ) : 
    (3 * x - 2) * (4 * x + 1) - ((3 * x - 2) * 4 * x) + 1 = P2002AMCB_2_answer x := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => (3 * x - 2) * (4 * x + 1) - (3 * x - 2) * 4 * x + 1
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℝ => 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents an equation that needs to be simplified:
   (3x - 2)(4x + 1) - (3x - 2)*4*x + 1 = ?

2. Ground Truth Answer shows the correct simplification process:
   - First term: (3x - 2)(4x + 1) = 12x² + 3x - 8x - 2 = 12x² - 5x - 2
   - Second term: -(3x - 2)*4*x = -12x² + 8x
   - Combined: (12x² - 5x - 2) - (12x² - 8x) + 1 = 3x - 2 + 1 = 3x - 1
   - But the ground truth answer shows the unsimplified form, which is equivalent to the original expression

3. Proposed Answer is simply "1", which is incorrect as it doesn't match the simplification result of 3x - 1

The proposed answer is completely different from the correct simplification, so they are not equivalent.
