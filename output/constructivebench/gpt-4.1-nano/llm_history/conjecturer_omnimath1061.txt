theorem omnimath1061 :
  IsGreatest {k : ℕ | ∃ (N : ℕ) (r w b : ℕ),
    r + w + b = N ∧
    N ≥ 3 ∧
    k = N / 3 ∧
    (r * w * b) * 6 / (N * (N - 1) * (N - 2)) > 23 / 100}
  omnimath1061_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Since the inequality involves N ≥ 3, with r,w,b sum to N, and the expression involving their product being greater than 23/100, the maximum k occurs for the minimal N where the product can be maximized proportionally, e.g., near balanced r,w,b ≈ N/3. The maximum occurs at N=3, with r=w=b=1 (since 1+1+1=3). Plugging in these gives the largest k = N/3 = 1.  
Final answer: <<<1>>>
