theorem omnimath3256 (x y : ℝ) :
  (1/x + 1/(2*y) = (x^2 + 3*y^2)*(3*x^2 + y^2) ∧ 
   1/x - 1/(2*y) = 2*(y^4 - x^4)) ↔ (x, y) ∈ omnimath3256_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: { ( (3^(1/5) + 1)/2, (3^(1/5) - 1)/2 ), 
    ( -(3^(1/5) + 1)/2, -(3^(1/5) - 1)/2 ) }
Proposed Answer: { p : ℝ × ℝ | p.2 = p.1 } ∪ { p : ℝ × ℝ | p.2 = -p.1 }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives a system of two equations involving x and y, and asks for all real solutions (x,y).

2. The ground truth answer provides two specific solutions expressed in terms of 3^(1/5).

3. The proposed answer suggests that all solutions lie on either the line y=x or y=-x.

Comparison:
- The proposed answer is much broader than the ground truth, claiming all pairs where y=±x are solutions.
- The ground truth shows only two specific pairs satisfy the equations.
- Testing the proposed answer: If we take y=x and substitute into the original equations, they don't hold true for arbitrary x. The equations are only satisfied at the specific points given in the ground truth.

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect as it includes many points that don't satisfy the original equations, while the ground truth provides the exact solutions.
