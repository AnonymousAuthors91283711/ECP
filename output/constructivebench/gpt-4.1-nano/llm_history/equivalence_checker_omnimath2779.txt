Ground Truth Answer: 119 / 8
Proposed Answer: 77
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives two positive real numbers x and y with conditions:
   - For x: ⌊x⌋ * x = 36 and x > 0
   - For y: ⌊y⌋ * y = 71 and y > 0

2. For x:
   - Try ⌊x⌋ = 6: then x = 36/6 = 6, but ⌊6⌋ = 6, so this works
   - Try ⌊x⌋ = 5: x = 36/5 = 7.2, but ⌊7.2⌋ = 7 ≠ 5 → invalid
   - Try ⌊x⌋ = 7: x = 36/7 ≈ 5.14, but ⌊5.14⌋ = 5 ≠ 7 → invalid
   - Only valid solution is x = 6

3. For y:
   - Try ⌊y⌋ = 8: y = 71/8 = 8.875, ⌊8.875⌋ = 8 → valid
   - Try ⌊y⌋ = 7: y = 71/7 ≈ 10.14, ⌊10.14⌋ = 10 ≠ 7 → invalid
   - Try ⌊y⌋ = 9: y = 71/9 ≈ 7.888, ⌊7.888⌋ = 7 ≠ 9 → invalid
   - Only valid solution is y = 8.875

4. Therefore x + y = 6 + 8.875 = 14.875 = 119/8

The ground truth answer (119/8) is correct, while the proposed answer (77) is incorrect.
