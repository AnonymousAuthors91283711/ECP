The problem asks for the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that, for some \( m \leq n \), the angle \( (m \times 123) \bmod 360 \) falls into each of the four quadrants defined by \( k=1,2,3,4 \). The pattern of the angles suggests considering multiples of 123 modulo 360, which generate a sequence that cycles through values covering all quadrants. The minimal \( n \) must allow all four angles to appear simultaneously, which occurs at the least common multiple of the circuit lengths. By computing or iterative reasoning, the minimal \( n \) is 1080, covering all quadrants.
