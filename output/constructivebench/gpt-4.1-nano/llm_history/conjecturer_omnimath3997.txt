    (nums : Fin 100 → ℝ)
    (hnums : (∑ i : Fin 100, (nums i) ^ 2) = (∑ i : Fin 100, ((nums i) + 1) ^ 2)) :
    (∑ i : Fin 100, ((nums i) + 2) ^ 2) - (∑ i : Fin 100, (nums i) ^ 2) = omnimath3997_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the equality (∑ (nums i)^2) = (∑ ((nums i)+1)^2), we deduce that the sum of differences cancels out, leading to the aggregate difference in squares when adding 2. The pattern suggests the total difference is 4 times the number of elements (since (x+2)^2 - x^2 = 4x + 4), summing over all 100 elements yields 400 plus a linear term that cancels out. The consistent pattern indicates the answer is 400.

<<<400>>>
