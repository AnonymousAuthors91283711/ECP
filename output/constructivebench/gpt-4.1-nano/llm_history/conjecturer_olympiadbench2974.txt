Given that the last digit of \(2^{10} + 10^2\) is fixed, and observing the pattern of \(2^n\), the minimal \(n > 10\) with the same last digit occurs at \(n=14\), where \(2^{14}\) last digit is 6 (since \(2^{14}\) mod 10 ≡ 6) and \(14^2\) last digit is also 6, summing to 2. Therefore, the minimal such \(n\) is 14.
