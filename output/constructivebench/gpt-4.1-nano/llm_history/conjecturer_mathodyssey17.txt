theorem mathodyssey17 :
    IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (n ^ 3 % 1000 = 888)} mathodyssey17_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern in enumerated answers suggests the minimal n satisfying 0 < n ∧ n^3 ≡ 888 (mod 1000) is n = 192, as 192^3 mod 1000 = 888. The formula aligns with checking such n in ascending order.

<<<192>>>
