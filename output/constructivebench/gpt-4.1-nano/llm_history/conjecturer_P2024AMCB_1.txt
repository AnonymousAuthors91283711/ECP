  (∃ (k : ℕ), k = 1013 ∧ n - k + 1 = 1010) ↔ n = P2024AMCB_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The condition n - 1013 + 1 = 1010 simplifies to n = 1010 + 1013 - 1 = 2022. The existential statement reduces directly to n=2022, thus the answer is the specific value itself.
