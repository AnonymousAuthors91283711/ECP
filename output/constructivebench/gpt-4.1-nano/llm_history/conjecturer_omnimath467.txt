The problem describes a set of functions represented by their zero lines, where each function corresponds to a linear equation \(a x + b y = 0\). The key constraints involve \(x^4 = x^2 y^2\), which simplifies to \(x^2 (x^2 - y^2) = 0\). The solutions for \(x^2 = 0\) or \(x^2 = y^2\) yield lines \(x = 0\) and \(x = \pm y\). The second statement ensures these lines cover all points satisfying the equation: the zero sets are either \(x = 0\) or \(x \pm y = 0\).

Thus, the set of all such functions corresponds to the three lines \(x = 0\), \(x = y\), and \(x = -y\). Therefore, the answer is 3.
