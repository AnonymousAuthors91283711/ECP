  IsLeast {S : ℝ | 0 < S ∧ ∃ (a r : ℝ), a / (1 - r) = S ∧ a * r = 1 ∧ |r| < 1} P2016AMCB_14_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Because $a/(1 - r) = S$ and $a r = 1$, solving yields $a = S(1 - r)$. Substituting into $a r = 1$ gives $S r (1 - r) = 1$, which simplifies to $S (r - r^2) = 1$, so $S = 1 / (r - r^2) = 1 / r (1 - r)$. To minimize $S$, maximize $r(1 - r)$ with $|r| < 1$, which occurs at $r = 1/2$, hence $S = 4$.
