Based on the pattern of the enumerated answers and the properties of set A, it appears that the maximal size corresponds to the number of possible coordinatewise bounds, which is 2^n for subsets of n elements with binary choices at each coordinate. The maximum card when the set A forms a lattice with these properties is therefore 2^n.
