theorem omnimath1284 : 
  let b := Finset.Icc 1 20
  let g := Finset.Icc 1 6 ×ˢ Finset.Icc 1 6 ×ˢ Finset.Icc 1 6
  (∑ x ∈ b, ∑ y ∈ g, if x > y.1 + y.2.1 + y.2.2 then 1 else 0) / (20 * 6^3) = omnimath1284_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The sum counts the cases where x > y₁ + y₂₁ + y₂₂; with y drawn from 1..6 triply, and x from 1..20. The total possibilities are 20 * 6³. The probability that x exceeds the sum of three independent uniform choices from 1..6 is approximately 0.5, since sums are roughly symmetric, and the median sum is around 10.5. 

Therefore, the final ratio approaches ½, which as a rational is 1/2.
