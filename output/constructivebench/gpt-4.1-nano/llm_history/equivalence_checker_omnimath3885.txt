Ground Truth Answer: { fun _ => 0, fun x => x + 1 }
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℤ, ∀ n : ℤ, f n = c * n}
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The ground truth gives two specific functions: the zero function and the successor function (x ↦ x + 1).

2. The proposed answer describes all linear functions through the origin (f(n) = c*n for some constant c).

The zero function (f(n) = 0) is included in both answers. However:
- The successor function (x ↦ x + 1) is in the ground truth but not in the proposed answer (since it's not linear through the origin)
- The proposed answer includes many functions (like f(n) = 2n) that aren't in the ground truth

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent. The proposed answer is incorrect as it both misses valid solutions and includes invalid ones.
