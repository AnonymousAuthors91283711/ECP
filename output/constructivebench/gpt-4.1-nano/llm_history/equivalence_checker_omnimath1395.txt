Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1), (2, 2^2017)}
Proposed Answer: { (a, b) | a = 1 ∨ b = 1 ∨ a = b }
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem asks for pairs (a,b) where a*b divides a^2017 + b. The ground truth gives two specific pairs: (1,1) and (2,2^2017).

The proposed answer suggests all pairs where either:
1. a=1
2. b=1
3. a=b

Let's evaluate:

1. For (1,1): 1*1 divides 1^2017 + 1 = 2 → False (but ground truth includes it)
2. For (2,2^2017): 2*2^2017 divides 2^2017 + 2^2017 = 2^2018 → True (matches ground truth)
3. For a=b: a*a divides a^2017 + a = a(a^2016 + 1) → only if a divides a^2016 + 1, which is rare (only a=1 works)

The proposed answer is too broad (includes many invalid cases) and misses some constraints. It's also incorrect about (1,1) case. The ground truth is more precise.
