Ground Truth Answer: 187465 / 6744582
Proposed Answer: 1 / 36
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the value of a sum involving coefficients a_i that satisfy certain conditions for k=1 to 5.

2. The ground truth answer is a specific fraction 187465/6744582 ≈ 0.0278.

3. The proposed answer is 1/36 ≈ 0.0278.

At first glance, the numerical values are very close (both ≈ 0.0278), but:

- The exact forms are different
- The proposed answer is much simpler
- There's no obvious simplification that would convert 187465/6744582 to 1/36

Given that competition problems typically expect exact answers, and these are different exact forms, I conclude they are not equivalent.
