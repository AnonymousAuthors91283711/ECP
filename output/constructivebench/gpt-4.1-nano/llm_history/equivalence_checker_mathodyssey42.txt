Ground Truth Answer: 90
Proposed Answer: 4011
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the cardinality of the set of integers α with |α| ≤ 2005 that satisfy a certain property P(α).

2. The ground truth answer is 90, which suggests there are 90 such integers α in the range [-2005, 2005] that satisfy the given condition.

3. The proposed answer is 4011, which is exactly 2*2005 + 1 (the total number of integers from -2005 to 2005 inclusive). This would imply that every integer in this range satisfies the condition, which seems highly unlikely given the complexity of the condition P(α).

4. The condition P(α) requires the existence of integers x,y such that x² = y + α and y² = x + α. This is a non-trivial condition that would only be satisfied by specific values of α.

The proposed answer of 4011 is clearly incorrect as it counts all integers in the range rather than just those satisfying the condition. The ground truth answer of 90 is much more reasonable for such a problem.
