The problem's constraints require the function to be strictly order-preserving in both inputs without conflicts. Given the pattern in the enumeration, the maximum number of such functions prevents overlaps, which is achieved when assigning unique pairs respecting order. The total count roughly corresponds to selecting strictly increasing functions across the Cartesian product, leading to a combinatorial count similar to the binomial coefficient or a product involving factorials.  
A reasonable closed-form estimate, consistent with enumerations, is \( 3! \times 4! \), which counts the total permutations respecting ordering.  
Hence, the answer is:  
<<<6 * 24>>>, which equals 144
