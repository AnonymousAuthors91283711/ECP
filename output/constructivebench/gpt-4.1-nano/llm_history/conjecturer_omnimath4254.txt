theorem omnimath4254 : 
  IsLeast {C : ℝ | ∀ (x : ℕ → ℝ) (_ : ∀ n, x n > 0) (_ : ∀ n, (∑ i ∈ Finset.range n, x i) ≤ x n), 
    ∀ n, (∑ i ∈ Finset.range n, sqrt (x i)) ≤ C * sqrt (∑ i ∈ Finset.range n, x i)} 
  omnimath4254_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the bound resembles a multiple of the square root sum, typical in inequalities involving sums of square roots.

Based on enumeration, the minimal such C appears to be 2, which aligns with Cauchy-Schwarz bounds.
