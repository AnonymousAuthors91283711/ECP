theorem omnimath2329 :
  {p : ℕ | Nat.Prime p ∧ ∃! a ∈ Icc 1 p, (a ^ 3 - 3 * a + 1) % p = 0} = omnimath2329_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The problem asks for prime p such that exactly one a in [1, p] satisfies a^3 - 3a + 1 ≡ 0 mod p. The pattern from enumeration suggests solutions are primes where this cubic has a unique root modulo p. The only primes with this property are p=2 and p=7, corresponding to roots at a=1, 2, and 6. So set includes exactly these primes.
