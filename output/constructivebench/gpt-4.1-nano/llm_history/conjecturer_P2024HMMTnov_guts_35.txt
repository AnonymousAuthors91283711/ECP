Let's analyze the sum: sum_{k=0}^{9} (1 - (N-1)/1024)^k. Since this is a finite geometric series with ratio r = 1 - (N-1)/1024, the sum equals (1 - r^{10}) / (1 - r). Requiring the sum < 2 bounds N. When N=1, the sum is 10, which is too large. As N approaches 1024, the sum approaches 10, and decreases with N. The minimal N ensuring the sum < 2 corresponds to N = 1024, where sum ≈ 1. (since ratio approaches zero). Therefore, the minimal N is 1024.

Final answer:
<<<1024>>>
