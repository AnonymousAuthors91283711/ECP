Given the conditions, the operation op appears to satisfy properties akin to multiplication with some linearity, especially since op distributes over products and extends from specific instances like op 2 2 = 4. The symmetry and continuity constraints, along with the special case at 2, suggest op resembles multiplication scaled or shifted suitably. The typical solution aligned with these properties and the pattern in the enumerated data implies that op acts as multiplication by a factor involving x. Since op 2 2 = 4 and op is symmetric and distributes as multiplication, the natural candidate is op a b = a * b, especially at x=2.

Therefore, solving op x y = x yields y = 1, as op acts identically to multiplication. The "omnimath3347_answer" in this context should reflect the number 1 to satisfy the functional equation under the constraints.

Hence, the answer is:

<<<1.0>>>
