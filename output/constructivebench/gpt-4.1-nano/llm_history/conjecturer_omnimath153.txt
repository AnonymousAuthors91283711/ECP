  (∃ (s : Set ℕ), s.Infinite ∧ ∀ n ∈ s, ¬ (↑n + k ∣ Nat.choose (2 * n) n)) ↔ k ∈ omnimath153_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℤ
The pattern suggests that for all n in an infinite subset s of ℕ, the divisibility condition fails for a specific congruence class of k. Given the pattern in the enumeration, a plausible closed form is that k is divisible by 2.
