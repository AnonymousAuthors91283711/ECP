theorem olympiadbench2570 (a b c : ℤ) :
    (b - a = c - b ∧ a + b + c = 60 ∧ ∃ r, (a - 2) * r = b ∧ b * r = c + 3) ↔

Ground Truth Answer: {(27, 20, 13), (18, 20, 22)}
Proposed Answer: { p | ∃ a : ℤ, p = (a, 60 - 2 * a, 120 - 3 * a) }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us three conditions:
   - b - a = c - b (arithmetic progression)
   - a + b + c = 60
   - ∃ r, (a - 2) * r = b ∧ b * r = c + 3

2. The ground truth gives two specific solutions: (27,20,13) and (18,20,22)

3. The proposed answer gives a parametric solution: (a, 60-2a, 120-3a)

Analysis:
- The first two conditions (arithmetic progression and sum) would indeed give the parametric form (a, 60-2a, 120-3a) as a general solution
- However, the third condition imposes additional constraints that will only be satisfied by specific values of a
- The proposed answer includes all possible triples satisfying just the first two conditions, but not the third
- The ground truth correctly identifies only the two triples that satisfy all three conditions

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect because it includes too many solutions that don't satisfy all conditions.
