The set consists of sums of cosine functions scaled by 3, with the total of cosines summing to zero. Pattern suggests the maximum sum occurs when the cosines are balanced to cancel out, implying symmetric arrangements like five pairs of cosines equal to 1 and -1, totaling zero. The maximum sum is thus 5 * 1 + 5 * (-1) = 0, scaled appropriately.  
Answer: <<<5 * 1>>>
