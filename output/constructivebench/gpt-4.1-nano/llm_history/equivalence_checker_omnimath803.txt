Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have two real numbers x and y with -1 < x < y < 1
2. We have two expressions G = x/(1-y) and G' = y/(1-x)
3. We're told G = G'
4. We need to find x + y when G = G'

Setting G = G' gives us:
x/(1-y) = y/(1-x)
Cross-multiplying:
x(1-x) = y(1-y)
x - x² = y - y²
Rearranging:
y² - x² - y + x = 0
(y - x)(y + x) - (y - x) = 0
(y - x)(y + x - 1) = 0

Since y > x (from hxy), y - x ≠ 0, so we must have:
y + x - 1 = 0
Therefore x + y = 1

The ground truth answer is 1, while the proposed answer is 0. These are clearly different.
