Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: 3
Let's analyze this problem carefully:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number k (=a) such that there exist non-negative integers b,c where a + 4b + 9c = 529 (since 23*23=529), with a > 0.

2. The ground truth answer is 1. Let's verify if this is possible:
   - If a=1, then 4b + 9c = 528
   - This has solutions like (b,c) = (3,57) since 4*3 + 9*57 = 12 + 513 = 525 ≠ 528 (this doesn't work)
   - Actually, (b,c) = (132,0) works since 4*132 = 528
   - So a=1 is achievable

3. The proposed answer is 3. While this is achievable (e.g., a=3, b=0, c=58.444... but c must be integer - wait no, 3 + 9*58 = 525 ≠ 529), but it's not the minimal possible since we saw a=1 works.

4. The minimal possible a is indeed 1, as shown by the solution (a,b,c) = (1,132,0).

The proposed answer (3) is not the minimal possible value, since 1 works.
