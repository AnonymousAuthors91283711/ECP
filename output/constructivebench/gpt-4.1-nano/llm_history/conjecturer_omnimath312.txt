The problem seeks the greatest natural number \( n \) for which a polynomial construction can satisfy certain evaluation conditions across the interval from 1 to \( n \). Based on the pattern in the enumerated answers, the maximal \( n \) fitting the polynomial with monic degree 3 constraints is 3, since these polynomials cannot produce all integers beyond 3 with the required properties. 

Therefore, the answer is a constant maximum: 

<<<3>>>
