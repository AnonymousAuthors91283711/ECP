The sums involve binomial coefficients with thresholds at non-integer k, likely representing indicator functions. The pattern suggests these sums correspond to cumulative probabilities at certain points, which simplifies to ranges for p based on the thresholds.

The effective set of p values where the inequality holds is when p lies within the interval that aligns with the bounds implied by the sums, i.e., p ∈ [0, 1].

Therefore, the final set is the entire possible p interval.

The error indicates that "set.univ" is being used as an abbreviation for "Set ℝ" but without the correct syntax. In Lean, the universe polymorphic 'Set' is an inductive type, and to denote the universe of all ℝ, you use "set.univ" (with lowercase 'set') directly, not as an abbreviation with invalid syntax.

Furthermore, the problem asks to identify the set of real numbers 'p' that satisfy the given equality. Based on the structure of the sums, the sums are sum over specific k values with conditions on k relative to half-integers (3/2 and 5/2). The sums are essentially sums of binomial probability mass functions over k in the range [0,3] or [0,5] with conditional restrictions (k > 3/2, k > 5/2).

Notice that for k being integer, the conditions k > 3/2 and k > 5/2 are equivalent to k ≥ 2 and k ≥ 3 respectively, as k ∈ ℕ.

- For the first sum (k in range 4), only k=2,3 are with k > 3/2.
- For the second sum (k in range 6), only k=3,4,5 are with k > 5/2.

Binomial sums over particular ranges yield the probability of certain events associated with bias p. The sums are equal iff p belongs to the set where these binomial sums are equal, which occurs at the symmetric point p=1/2, corresponding to the symmetry of the binomial distribution with n=3 and n=5.

Thus, the set of all p where the sums are equal should be the singleton set {1/2}.

The error indicates that the syntax `<<<1/2>>>` is invalid in Lean for defining a constant. Instead, to define the set of all parameters p satisfying the condition implied by the equivalence, we should explicitly describe the set in terms of a property.

From the structure of the probability sums, the key distinction is whether the sum's criteria (k > 3/2 and k > 5/2) align at a particular point p. Observing the sum bounds, for the first sum over k in [0,3], the terms where k > 3/2 include k=2,3, and for the second sum over k in [0,5], the terms where k > 5/2 include k=3,4,5.

The sums are equal precisely when these indicator-dependent sums are equal, which occurs in particular when p ≥ 1/2. This is because:

- For p < 1/2, the number of terms with k > 3/2 (i.e., k=2,3) and k > 5/2 (k=3,4,5) change their values differently, and the sums do not match.
- For p ≥ 1/2, the sums over those indices balance out, because the indicator functions activate smoothly.

Hence, the set of p satisfying the equivalence is the interval [1/2, 1], as p must be between 0 and 1, inclusive, and satisfy p ≥ 1/2.

Taking in these considerations, we can define the set explicitly as:

`{ p ∈ ℝ | 1/2 ≤ p ∧ p ≤ 1 }`.

The current definition of `abbrev omnimath3336_answer` is misplaced: the mistake is in declaring it with `abbrev` and then assigning a set directly with an incomplete syntax. In Lean, to declare a set of reals satisfying certain properties, it’s typical to write `def` or `noncomputable def` if necessary, or simply `@[reducible] def`, and assign it a set notation using `{ p | condition }`. Also, avoid redeclaring the same name (which produces error 2). Since the range sums are over binomial probabilities, and the toggle between them depends on the value of `k`, a natural point is where the two sums are equal, which occurs typically at a symmetric value of `p`. In binomial distributions, the sums up to 3 and 5 with these thresholds relate to binomial probabilities.

From the pattern in enumerated answers and known properties of binomial distributions, the key is that the sums are equal at `p = 1/2`. A detailed examination suggests the equal point occurs at `p = 1/2`. Since the sum threshold switches at `k > 3/2` and `k > 5/2`, which correspond to the middle points for n=3 and n=5 respectively, the equality point is likely at the symmetry point `p = 1/2`.

Hence, one concise, correct form is:

```lean
def omnimath3336_answer : Set ℝ := { p | 1/2 ≤ p ∧ p ≤ 1 }
```

which matches the intuition that the sums are equal for all p in `[1/2, 1]`, given the binomial symmetry and cumulative properties.

The error indicates a syntax mistake stemming from the use of `def` within an `abbrev`. Also, the variable `omnimath3336_answer` is already declared as an `abbrev`, so redefining it with `def` causes the error. Moreover, the notation for summation is slightly deprecated, suggesting `∑ x ∈ s, f x` instead of `∑ x in s, f x`.

Given the pattern of the summation expressions, the question seems to involve probabilities related to binomial coefficients with a parameter \( p \), spanning indices from 3 to 5, with conditions involving \( k > 3/2 \) and \( k > 5/2 \).

The main logical insight is that this comparison probably distinguishes a range of \( p \) values for which these sums are equal, which, based on the enumerated answers and standard binomial distributions, corresponds to \( p \in [1/2, 1] \). 

The final form should be a set expressed as a subset of real numbers, specifically an interval from 1/2 to 1.

**Thus, the corrected answer is:**

<<<{ p | 1/2 ≤ p ∧ p ≤ 1 }>>>

This avoids redeclaring or redefining `omnimath3336_answer`, uses proper syntax, and generalizes the answer pattern indicated by the enumerations and the structures in the problem.
