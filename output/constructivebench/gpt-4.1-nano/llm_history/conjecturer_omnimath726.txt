The polynomial satisfies a quadratic form, with the given evaluations. Based on the pattern, the function resembles P(3) = P(0) + 3 P(1) + 9 P(2) for some constants, and the initial conditions suggest a quadratic polynomial with specific values at -1 and 0. The answer aligns with the quadratic polynomial evaluated at 3, which simplifies to 6.
