The pattern in solutions suggest combining the coefficients into a closed form: 100 * a + 10 * b + c. Based on the sums and the list, it appears that the total sum is obtained by summing over (+100, +10, +1) times the coefficients and their values, which align with the pattern 8 * 100 + 2 * 10 + 4 as a summation of coefficient contributions. 

Thus, the consistent closed form seems to be the linear combination of these coefficients scaled appropriately.

<<<(8 * 100) + (2 * 10) + 4>>>
