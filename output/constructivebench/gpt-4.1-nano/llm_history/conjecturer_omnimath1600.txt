The problem constrains the subset to have exactly 99 elements out of (Fin 19 × Fin 19), ensuring no two points are within 1 unit in both coordinates. This suggests partitioning the 19×19 grid into blocks separated by gaps of length 2, which reduces the maximum number of points without violating constraints. Each 2×2 block can hold at most one point with the given restrictions, and the grid effectively contains 9×9 such blocks (since 19//2 = 9). Therefore, the maximum count of 99 points aligns with filling every such block to maximize the total. 

Answer:
<<<(9 * 9) * 1>>>
