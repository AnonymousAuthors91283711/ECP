Ground Truth Answer: {170}
Proposed Answer: {a : ℝ | ∃ r : ℝ, a = 8 * r + 8 * r^3}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the set of real numbers 'a' such that the quartic equation P(a,x) = 0 has four distinct real roots in geometric progression.

2. The ground truth answer is {170}, meaning a must be exactly 170 for this condition to hold.

3. The proposed answer gives a parametric form {a : ℝ | ∃ r : ℝ, a = 8 * r + 8 * r^3}, which describes a set of possible 'a' values depending on 'r'.

To check equivalence:
- For the geometric progression condition, we can substitute x, rx, r²x, r³x into the equation.
- Solving this system leads to specific constraints on 'a' and 'r'.
- The only real solution that satisfies all conditions (four distinct real roots) occurs when r = 2, which gives a = 8*2 + 8*2³ = 16 + 64 = 80, not 170.
- Alternatively, if we consider r = 1/2, we get a = 8*(1/2) + 8*(1/2)³ = 4 + 1 = 5, which is also not 170.

The proposed answer gives a general form, but it doesn't restrict to the specific case where four distinct real roots exist (which only happens at a=170). Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
