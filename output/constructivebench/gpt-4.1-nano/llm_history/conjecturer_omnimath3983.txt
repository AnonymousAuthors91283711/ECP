Because each iteration doubles or halves the previous value based on a threshold (2^m), the set of possible initial values a 1 leading to valid sequences is exactly the set of initial integers less than or equal to 2^m, as larger values stabilize rapidly. Thus, the candidate answer is the set of all integers a 1 with magnitude at most 2^m.
