Given the symmetric conditions \( r_1 r_2 = 8 \) and \( r_1 + r_2 = 180 \), the expression simplifies by substituting \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \) in terms of elementary symmetric sums. Recognizing the pattern from the enumerated answers, the expression seems to relate to symmetric powers and cube roots. The consistent pattern indicates the expression evaluates to \( 36 \).
