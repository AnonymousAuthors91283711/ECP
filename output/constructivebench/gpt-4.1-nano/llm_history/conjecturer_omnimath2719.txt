    (S : Set (ℕ × ℕ))
    (hS : S = {(i, j) : ℕ × ℕ | 1 ≤ i ∧ i ≤ 6 ∧ 1 ≤ j ∧ j ≤ 6 ∧ i * j = 12}) :
    (S.ncard : ℝ) / 36 = omnimath2719_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the enumeration pattern, the set's cardinality is 4, so the ratio to 36 is 4/36 = 1/9. 

<<<(1:ℝ) / 9>>>
