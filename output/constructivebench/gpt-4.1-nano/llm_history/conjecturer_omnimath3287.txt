The problem asserts the nonexistence of 16 three-digit numbers with 4 unique digits, all containing exactly three digits from a set of 3 digits, with all having distinct remainders modulo 16. 

Given the constraints — especially the exclusivity of remainders modulo 16 and digits within 100-999 — the critical insight is that 16 numbers with distinct mod 16 remainders cannot be formed if digits are restricted, or form a contradiction due to the limitation of digit combinations. 

Therefore, the statement reduces to asserting the impossibility based on digit and modulo constraints, regardless of the specific digits. The answer embodies the contradiction or impossibility:

<<<False>>>
