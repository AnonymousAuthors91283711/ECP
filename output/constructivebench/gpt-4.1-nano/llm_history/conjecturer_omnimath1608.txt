The pattern suggests exponential growth patterns in a sequence with specific initial conditions. Noticing that \(a_1=8=2^3\), \(a_2=64=2^6\), \(a_3=1024=2^{10}\), the exponents grow quadratically. The sequence seems to follow \(a_n = 2^{2n}\), so the sum combines geometric series. Final expression is \( 2^3 + 2^6 + 2^{10} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty 2^{2(n+3)} \). Summing the geometric series yields \( 2^{10} \). Then, the sum is dominated by \( 2^{2n} \), leading to a closed form involving powers of 2. The square root simplifies to \( 16 \).

<<<Real.sqrt (8 + Real.sqrt 64 + Real.sqrt 1024 + 1024)>>>
