Ground Truth Answer: 1940
Proposed Answer: 90
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the number of quadruples (a,b,c,d) of positive integers where:
   - Each a,b,c,d divides 30
   - Their product a*b*c*d > 900

2. First, let's find all positive divisors of 30:
   The prime factorization of 30 is 2×3×5, so its divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30 (8 total)

3. The total number of possible quadruples without any constraints is 8^4 = 4096.

4. The ground truth answer is 1940, which represents the number of quadruples where the product exceeds 900.

5. The proposed answer is 90, which is significantly smaller than 1940.

6. To verify, let's consider that even if we take the smallest possible products (like 1×1×1×30 = 30 which doesn't satisfy >900), we'd need combinations where most numbers are large. The count of such combinations would be much higher than 90.

The proposed answer of 90 is clearly too small compared to the ground truth of 1940. They are not equivalent.
