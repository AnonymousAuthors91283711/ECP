Given the exponential and polynomial expressions, the solutions are constrained by the properties of powers and exponents. The sum involving powers of 20 and 14^2*y is highly restrictive, leading to a specific relationship between x, y, z, t. Based on pattern recognition and the structure of the equation, the final answer set simplifies to a singleton where x, y, z, t satisfy a particular linear relationship. The very specific form hints that the only solutions are when the exponents and bases align, i.e., when x=0, y=0, z= (some fixed value), t= (fixed power), or similar trivial solutions assuming positive constraints. In this context, the general form can be expressed as:

<<< {(1, 1, 1, 1)} >>>
