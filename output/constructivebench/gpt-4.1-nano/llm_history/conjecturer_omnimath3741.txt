abbrev omnimath3741_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3741 (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) :
  (∀ (a : ℕ → ℝ), (∀ i, 0 < a i) → 
    (∑ i ∈ Finset.range n, a i^2) * (∑ i ∈ Finset.range n, a i) - (∑ i ∈ Finset.range n, a i^3) ≥ 6 * ∏ i ∈ Finset.range n, a i) 
  ↔ n ∈ omnimath3741_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests the answer pertains to the minimal dimension for the inequality, notably when n=4, aligned with hypercube symmetries and classical identities. The inequality resembles variants of the Cauchy-Schwarz or algebraic identities, which are tight at n=4.
