abbrev P2015AMCB_8_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2015AMCB_8 : 
  (625 ^ (logb 5 2015)) ^ (1/4) = P2015AMCB_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The expression simplifies as: (625 ^ (log_b 5 2015))^(1/4). Note 625 = 5^4, so the expression becomes 5^{4 * log_b 5 2015 / 4} = 5^{log_b 5 2015} = 2015. 

Final answer: <<<2015>>>
