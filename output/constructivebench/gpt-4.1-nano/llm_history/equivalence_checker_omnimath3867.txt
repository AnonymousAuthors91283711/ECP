Ground Truth Answer: {fun x : ℝ => -1, fun x : ℝ => x - 1}
Proposed Answer: { f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ x, f x = c ∧ c ≠ 0 }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for all functions f: ℝ → ℝ that satisfy:
   - f(0) ≠ 0
   - The functional equation: (f(x+y))² = 2f(x)f(y) + max(f(x²+y²), f(x²)+f(y²))

2. Ground Truth Answer provides two specific functions:
   - f(x) = -1 (constant function)
   - f(x) = x - 1 (linear function)

3. Proposed Answer claims the solution is all constant functions f(x) = c where c ≠ 0

Analysis:
- The constant function f(x) = -1 does satisfy both conditions (f(0) = -1 ≠ 0, and the functional equation holds)
- However, the linear function f(x) = x - 1 is not constant but also satisfies the conditions (f(0) = -1 ≠ 0, and the functional equation can be verified to hold)
- The proposed answer misses the non-constant solution f(x) = x - 1
- The proposed answer is correct in identifying that constant functions are solutions, but incomplete

Conclusion: The proposed answer is partially correct but misses some valid solutions.
