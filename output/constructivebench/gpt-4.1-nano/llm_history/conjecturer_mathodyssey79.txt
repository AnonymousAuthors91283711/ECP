abbrev mathodyssey79_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem mathodyssey79 :
  IsLeast {k : ℝ | ∃ (x y z : ℝ), 0 ≤ x ∧ 0 ≤ y ∧ 0 ≤ z ∧ 
  4 * x^2 + 4 * y^2 + z^2 + 2 * z = 3 ∧ 
  5 * x + 4 * y + 3 * z = k} mathodyssey79_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Since the problem involves minimizing a quadratic form under linear constraints, the minimal value occurs at the critical point. Solving the system suggests that the minimum is achieved when z = -1, with corresponding x, y satisfying the equations. The minimal value for k, by substituting back, simplifies to 2.
