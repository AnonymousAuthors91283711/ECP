  (∀ b : ℝ, ∃ x y, a * x + b * y = c - 1 ∧ (a + 5) * x + (b + 3) * y = c + 1) ↔ c = omnimath2164_answer a := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a => (2 * a + 5) / 5
Proposed Answer: fun a => - (a + 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a condition on c (in terms of a) such that for every real b, there exist x,y satisfying both given linear equations.

2. This is equivalent to requiring that the system of equations has a solution for all b, which means the two equations must be consistent (not parallel) and the determinant condition must hold.

3. The ground truth answer is c = (2a + 5)/5, which comes from solving the consistency condition of the system.

4. The proposed answer is c = -(a + 1), which is clearly different from the ground truth answer.

The two answers are not equivalent, as they give different functional relationships between c and a.
