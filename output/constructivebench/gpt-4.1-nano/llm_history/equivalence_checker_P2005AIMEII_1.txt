Ground Truth Answer: 13
Proposed Answer: 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n ≥ 6 where the binomial coefficient C(n,6) equals 6 times C(n,3).

2. The ground truth answer is 13, which is correct because:
   - C(13,6) = 1716
   - C(13,3) = 286
   - 6 * 286 = 1716
   And no smaller n ≥ 6 satisfies this equation.

3. The proposed answer is 9, which is incorrect because:
   - C(9,6) = 84
   - C(9,3) = 84
   - 6 * 84 = 504 ≠ 84

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the given equation, while the ground truth does. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
