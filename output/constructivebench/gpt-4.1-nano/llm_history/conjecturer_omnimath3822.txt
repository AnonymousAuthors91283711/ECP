The problem asks for the maximum length of a sequence of knight moves on a 5x5 board with no repeated positions. Since the knight's move pattern is well-known from chess, it can traverse most cells in a closed tour. On a 5x5 board, a Knight's tour exists that visits all 25 cells exactly once. 

Therefore, the greatest n satisfying the conditions is 25.
