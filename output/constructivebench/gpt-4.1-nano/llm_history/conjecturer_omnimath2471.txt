Given the constraints, the final board must have all positions filled with a winning line for a specific player (preferably player 2). The only possible unique final configuration with all entries occupied and exactly one winner is a fully filled 3x3 matrix with all positions set to 'some 2'. 

The total number of such configurations is 1: a matrix where each cell is 'some 2'.  
Other configurations either have unfilled cells or multiple winners, which violate the unique winner condition.

Therefore, the count is 1.
