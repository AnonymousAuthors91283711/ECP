The exponent factorization \(m^n = 2^{25} \times 3^{40}\) suggests \(m\) and \(n\) depend on prime powers. Since \(m^n\) is a power of 2 and 3, and the exponents are known, use root extraction to determine \(m\). Observations suggest \(m = 2^{25/k} \times 3^{40/k}\) with \(k = \gcd(n, 25, 40)\). The minimal sum occurs when \(n\) divides both 25 and 40, so \(n=5\), \(m=2^5 \times 3^8\). Then \(m + n = 32 + 5 = 37\).
