The set describes x with fractional part in [0,1), and floor division condition. The crucial point is the relation ⌊x⌋ / x = 2015/2016, which implies x is just less than 2015, with fractional part close to 1; thus, the minimum x satisfying relation is just less than 2015 + 1/2016. The maximal x would then be just less than 2016, but the greatest x fitting the relation is 2015 + 1/2016.

Hence, the answer is 2015 + 1/2016

<<<2015 + 1/2016>>>
