Ground Truth Answer: 13 / 3
Proposed Answer: 6
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the limit of the sum of roots of a sequence of polynomials defined recursively.

2. The ground truth answer is 13/3 ≈ 4.333...

3. The proposed answer is 6.

4. The sequence is defined by:
   - a₁ = 3X² - X
   - a₂ = 3X² - 7X + 3
   - aₙ₊₂ = (5/2)aₙ₊₁ - aₙ for n ≥ 1

5. To find the limit of root sums, we can analyze the recurrence relation. The characteristic equation for the recurrence is r² - (5/2)r + 1 = 0, with roots 2 and 1/2.

6. The general solution suggests the root sums should converge to a finite value (since one root is <1 and the other is >1, but the dominant term is 2).

7. Calculating initial root sums:
   - For a₁: roots are 0 and 1/3 → sum = 1/3 ≈ 0.333
   - For a₂: roots are (7±√13)/6 → sum = 7/3 ≈ 2.333
   - The sequence is clearly not approaching 6.

8. The ground truth answer 13/3 makes sense as it fits the pattern of convergence, while 6 does not match the behavior of the sequence.
