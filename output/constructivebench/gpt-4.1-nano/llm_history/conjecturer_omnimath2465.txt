The conditions specify that n is divisible by 10 and the digits are non-increasing from the most significant to least significant. Since the digits (except for the last) are ≥ next digit, the sequence of digits from the most significant to the least is non-increasing, starting with at least 1 (since n ≥ 10^9). The largest such number with 10 digits having non-increasing digits and divisible by 11 means maximum decreasing digits starting from 9 down to 0. The smallest digit permissible is 0, but since n ≥ 10^9, n has 10 digits. The pattern suggests the maximal number with decreasing digits starting from 9, ending with 0, divisible by 11. 

The largest number fitting this pattern with those constraints is 9876543210, which is divisible by 11 (by subtracting the sum of digits at odd positions from even positions, which equals zero). Therefore, the answer is 1.
