Ground Truth Answer: 3989
Proposed Answer: 302
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves finding the sum of (x³ + y³)⁻¹ for all pairs of distinct roots of the polynomial X³ + 3X - 1, then expressing this sum as a reduced fraction m/n, and finally computing 100m + n.

2. The ground truth answer is 3989, which would correspond to m=39 and n=89 (since 100*39 + 89 = 3989).

3. The proposed answer is 302, which would correspond to m=3 and n=2.

4. The polynomial X³ + 3X - 1 has three real roots (as can be verified by checking its discriminant is positive). The sum in question is indeed a rational number, but the proposed answer's values (m=3, n=2) are too small to be plausible for this problem.

5. The ground truth answer (m=39, n=89) is more reasonable given the nature of the problem and the calculations involved.
