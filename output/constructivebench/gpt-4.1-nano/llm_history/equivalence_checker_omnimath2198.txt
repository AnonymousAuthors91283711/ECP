Ground Truth Answer: 7 / 2
Proposed Answer: (3 + √5) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the maximum value of the expression b/a + c/b + a/c under the constraints:
   - 0 < a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ 2a
   - All variables are positive

2. The ground truth answer is 7/2 (which is 3.5)

3. The proposed answer is (3 + √5)/2 ≈ (3 + 2.236)/2 ≈ 2.618

Comparison:
- The proposed answer is significantly smaller than the ground truth answer (2.618 vs 3.5)
- The maximum actually occurs when c = 2a and b is chosen optimally between a and 2a
- The proposed answer appears to be solving a different optimization problem or making incorrect assumptions
