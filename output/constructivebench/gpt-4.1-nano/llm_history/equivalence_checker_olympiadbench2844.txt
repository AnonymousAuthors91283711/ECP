Ground Truth Answer: 2018
Proposed Answer: 2016
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest year y > 2012 where the number of days between 2012 and y is divisible by 7 (i.e., the same weekday as 2012).

2. The ground truth answer is 2018, which means:
   - 2018-2012 = 6 years
   - Normally 6*365 = 2190 days
   - Plus leap years in 2012-2017 (2012, 2016) = 2 days
   - Total 2192 days
   - 2192 mod 7 = 0 (since 2192/7 = 313.142..., but actually 2192 mod 7 = 1, so this seems incorrect)

Wait, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the proposed answer 2016:
   - 2016-2012 = 4 years
   - Normally 4*365 = 1460 days
   - Plus leap years (2012, 2016) = 2 days (but 2016 hasn't happened yet when counting)
   - Actually, the leap years would be just 2012 (since we're counting up to y-1)
   - Total 1461 days
   - 1461 mod 7 = 5 (not 0)

Neither answer seems correct at first glance, but the ground truth 2018 is closer to being correct when considering the actual calendar:
- From 2012 to 2018 is 6 years with 2 leap years (2012, 2016)
- Total days = 6*365 + 2 = 2192
- 2192 mod 7 = 1 (not 0)
- The next candidate would be 2019 (7*365 + 2 = 2557, mod 7 = 2)
- Then 2020 (8*365 + 3 = 2923, mod 7 = 4)
- Then 2021 (9*365 + 3 = 3288, mod 7 = 6)
- Then 2023 (11*365 + 3 = 4018, mod 7 = 0)

The correct answer should actually be 2023, but between the given options, 2018 is closer to being correct than 2016.
