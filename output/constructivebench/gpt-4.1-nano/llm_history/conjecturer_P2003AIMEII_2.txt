The problem asks for the greatest 10-digit multiple of 8 with all digits distinct, and to specify its last three digits. Since the largest 10-digit number with all distinct digits is 9876543210, and among smaller candidates divisible by 8, the pattern suggests we focus on the largest configuration ending with digits divisible by 8.

The pattern from enumeration indicates that the largest such number ends with 0, 4, 8, and is constructed by using the largest digits in order. Checking divisibility by 8, the last three digits should be 104 because 104 is divisible by 8, and placing remaining digits in decreasing order before allows for maximal number: 9876534210.

Therefore, the last three digits are 210, which is divisible by 8, and the entire number is maximal with all distinct digits.

The last three digits: 210.

Final Lean expression, with pattern derived accordingly:

<<<210>>>
