Ground Truth Answer: (35, 90)
Proposed Answer: (1, 100)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find the greatest pair (p₁, p₂) where:
   - 1 ≤ p₁ ≤ p₂ ≤ 100
   - There exists a natural number k such that (p₁ + p₂)(p₁ + p₂ + 1) = k*p₁*p₂

2. The ground truth answer is (35, 90). Let's verify it:
   - Sum: 35 + 90 = 125
   - 125 * 126 = 15750
   - 35 * 90 = 3150
   - 15750 / 3150 = 5 (integer k)

3. The proposed answer is (1, 100):
   - Sum: 1 + 100 = 101
   - 101 * 102 = 10302
   - 1 * 100 = 100
   - 10302 / 100 = 103.02 (not an integer)

The proposed answer (1, 100) doesn't satisfy the condition since k isn't an integer, while (35, 90) does. They are not equivalent.
