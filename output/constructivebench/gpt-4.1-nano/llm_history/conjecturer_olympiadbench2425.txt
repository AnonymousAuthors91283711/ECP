The equation cos θ = tan θ implies cos θ = sin θ / cos θ, or cos^2 θ = sin θ. Since sin^2 θ + cos^2 θ = 1, substitute cos^2 θ = sin θ: sin θ + sin^2 θ = 1. This quadratic yields sin θ = (−1 ± √5)/2. Corresponding cos θ = √(1 − sin^2 θ). So s equals these sin θ values valid in ℝ.

The errors indicate that `real.sqrt` is not recognized because either the `real` namespace is not opened or the function is not available under that namespace. In Lean, the square root function for real numbers is typically `Real.sqrt`, but it might require the `Reals` library or the appropriate namespace open statement.

**Reasoning:**

- The standard library uses `Real.sqrt` for square root if `Reals` namespace is open.
- Alternatively, you can use `Real.sqrt`, provided that `Reals` is imported (which is implied by `import Mathlib`).
- The error suggests that `real.sqrt` (case-sensitive) is invalid; hence, the proper name is `Real.sqrt`.
- The current answer involves only rational operations and `sqrt(5)`, which are well-understood algebraic numbers, especially roots of quadratic equations.

**Proposal:**

Replace `real.sqrt` with `Real.sqrt`. Also, since the set description involves algebraic numbers with specific known roots, the set simplifies to two points, which are solutions to `sin θ = cos θ`. Solving that, we get `tan θ = 1`, leading to `θ = π/4 + kπ`, and the sines and cosines at these points match the answers involving `(±sqrt 2)/2`.

Given the problem's current answer, the points involve `sqrt 5`, which suggests the actual solutions to some quadratic related to the problem. However, based on standard derivation, the solutions are simplified as:

\[
s = \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

which aligns with `± (1/√2)` since `√2/2` simplifies to `1/√2`.

But the solution in the enumerated answer involves `sqrt 5`, indicating roots related to quadratic formulas involving 5. The solutions to quadratic equation `x^2 + x - 1 = 0` are:

\[
x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

which aligns with the numerator expression.

**Thus, the final closed form in Lean:**

```lean
<<<{ s | s = ( (-1 + Real.sqrt 5) / 2 ) } ∪ { s | s = ( (-1 - Real.sqrt 5) / 2 ) }>>>
```

This correctly uses `Real.sqrt` and captures the two points, which are roots of the quadratic `x^2 + x - 1 = 0`, consistent with the original answers.

---

**Summary:**

- Fix the namespace of `sqrt`.
- Use union `∪` to define the set.
- The algebraic roots are best presented as two separate sets combined, matching the enumerated solutions.

Hence, the corrected final answer is:

```lean
<<<{ s | s = ( (-1 + Real.sqrt 5) / 2 ) } ∪ { s | s = ( (-1 - Real.sqrt 5) / 2 ) }>>>

The error arises because the answer is directly assigned a syntax that uses `<<<` and `>>>`, which are not valid in Lean syntax for defining constants or abbreviations. Instead, the expression should be a valid Lean expression assigned via `abbrev` or `def` that matches the expected type `Set ℝ`.

From the problem, the set of real numbers \( s \) where \(\sin \theta = s\) and \(\cos \theta = \tan \theta\) has solutions at specific values, especially roots of a quadratic involving the Golden Ratio. The specific solutions are known to be \(\frac{-1 \pm \sqrt 5}{2}\).

Given the pattern from the enumerated answers and typical formalization, the correct form should be a union of singleton sets containing these solutions, represented properly in Lean syntax.

Here's the fixed, formalized answer—using explicit singleton sets with curly braces—and making sure it compiles as `abbrev`:

```lean
abbrev olympiadbench2425_answer : Set ℝ := { s | s = ((-1 + Real.sqrt 5) / 2) } ∪ { s | s = ((-1 - Real.sqrt 5) / 2) }
```

This assignment uses standard Lean set notation, is a proper `Set ℝ`, and covers both solutions explicitly. This form aligns with the detected pattern in the enumerated answer and correctly formalizes the solution set intended by the problem.
