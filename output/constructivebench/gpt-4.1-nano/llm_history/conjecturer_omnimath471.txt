Given the problem involves minimal N such that for any 2016-card subset s of 1..N, there exists another 2016-card subset t within the difference with sum equal to N, the minimal N should be just enough to contain the sum of the first 2016 natural numbers, because the sum of 1 to m is m(m+1)/2. To ensure such a t exists, N must be at least the sum of 1..2016. Thus, the answer is the sum of the first 2016 integers:

(2016 * 2017) / 2

which forms the minimal N satisfying the conditions.

The current proposed answer `(2016 * 2017)) / 2` contains an unmatched parenthesis, which causes a syntax error. Removing the extra parenthesis resolves this:

- The initial parenthesis before `2016 * 2017` is matched with the closing parenthesis after the multiplication, but there is an extra closing parenthesis after that. 

- The correct expression should be `(2016 * 2017) / 2`, matching the standard formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers: `n(n+1)/2`.

- Given the problem involves choosing 2016 elements summed up to N within a range, and the answer resembles the summation of a sequence, the closed form aligns with the triangular number formula.

**Final corrected answer:**

<<<(2016 * 2017) / 2>>>

**Explanation:** The formula `(2016 * 2017) / 2` is derived from the classic sum of the first n natural numbers, which naturally fits the pattern of summing 2016 consecutive increasing integers starting from 1 to N, where N should be the sum of integers from 1 up to 2016, i.e., the 2016th triangular number.
