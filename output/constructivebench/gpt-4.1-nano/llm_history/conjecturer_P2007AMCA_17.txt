The problem involves deriving a closed form for \(\cos(a - b)\) based on the sums \(\sin a + \sin b = \sqrt{5/3}\) and \(\cos a + \cos b = 1\). By using sum-to-product identities:

\[
\sin a + \sin b = 2 \sin \frac{a + b}{2} \cos \frac{a - b}{2}, \quad
\cos a + \cos b = 2 \cos \frac{a + b}{2} \cos \frac{a - b}{2}.
\]

Dividing these equations yields:

\[
\frac{\sin a + \sin b}{\cos a + \cos b} = \tan \frac{a + b}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}}{1} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}.
\]

From the second sum:

\[
\cos a + \cos b = 2 \cos \frac{a + b}{2} \cos \frac{a - b}{2} = 1,
\]

which implies

\[
\cos \frac{a + b}{2} \cos \frac{a - b}{2} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Since

\[
\sin \frac{a + b}{2} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} \cos \frac{a - b}{2},
\]

and using \(\sin^2 + \cos^2 = 1\), we get:

\[
\left(\sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} \cos \frac{a - b}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\cos \frac{a + b}{2}\right)^2 = 1,
\]
which simplifies to

\[
\frac{5}{3} \left(\cos \frac{a - b}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\cos \frac{a + b}{2}\right)^2 = 1.
\]

Using the earlier relation:

\[
\cos \frac{a + b}{2} \cos \frac{a - b}{2} = \frac{1}{2},
\]

let's denote:

\[
x := \cos \frac{a + b}{2}, \quad y := \cos \frac{a - b}{2}.
\]

Then:

\[
x y = \tfrac{1}{2},
\]
and the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{5}{3} y^2 + x^2 = 1.
\]

From \(x y = \frac{1}{2}\), we have \(x = \frac{1}{2 y}\). Substitute into the second equation:

\[
\frac{5}{3} y^2 + \frac{1}{4 y^2} = 1.
\]

Multiplying through by \(4 y^2\):

\[
\frac{20}{3} y^4 + 1 = 4 y^2.
\]

Rearranged:

\[
\frac{20}{3} y^4 - 4 y^2 + 1 = 0,
\]

which is a quadratic in \(z = y^2\):

\[
\frac{20}{3} z^2 - 4 z + 1 = 0,
\]

or equivalently:

\[
20 z^2 - 12 z + 3 = 0,
\]

dividing throughout by 1:

\[
20 z^2 - 12 z + 3 = 0.
\]

Discriminant:

\[
\Delta = (-12)^2 - 4 \times 20 \times 3 = 144 - 240 = -96 < 0,
\]

which indicates no real solutions for \(z\). However, since actual angles are real, this suggests the specific solution corresponds to particular values, and the ultimate goal is to find the explicit value of \(\cos(a - b)\).

Given the pattern and reflection over known identities, the unique real value for \(\cos(a - b)\) derived from the initial sums is:

\[
\cos(a - b) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

This aligns with the pattern of such problems, where the result simplifies to a rational constant involving the given sums.

The main issue in the proposed answer `(1 / 3): ℝ` is the syntax. In Lean, when defining a constant or abbrev, the syntax should be `: ℝ` without a colon after the expression. 

Furthermore, to form a concise, closed-form answer based on the geometric or trigonometric constraints given, I observe that:

- The sum of sines and cosines suggests the use of sum-to-product identities.
- The conditions hint at an angle difference.

The canonical approach: I analyze the given conditions:

1. `sin a + sin b = sqrt(5/3)`
2. `cos a + cos b = 1`

Using sum-to-product identities:

- `sin a + sin b = 2 sin((a + b)/2) cos((a - b)/2)`
- `cos a + cos b = 2 cos((a + b)/2) cos((a - b)/2)`

Let `M = (a + b)/2` and `D = (a - b)/2`. Then:

- `2 sin M cos D = sqrt(5/3)`
- `2 cos M cos D = 1`

Dividing the first by the second:

`(sin M) / (cos M) = sqrt(5/3) / 1 = sqrt(5/3)`

So:

`tan M = sqrt(5/3)`

From the second:

`2 cos M cos D = 1` ⇒ `cos M cos D = 1/2`

Given `tan M = sqrt(5/3)`, we can find `cos M`, which is:

`cos M = 1 / sqrt(1 + tan^2 M) = 1 / sqrt(1 + 5/3) = 1 / sqrt(1 + 5/3)`

Compute:

`1 + 5/3 = (3/3) + (5/3) = 8/3`

Thus:

`cos M = 1 / sqrt(8/3) = 1 / (sqrt(8/3)) = 1 / (sqrt(8)/sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3) / sqrt(8) = sqrt(3) / (2 sqrt 2) = (sqrt(3))/ (2 sqrt(2))`

Similarly, `cos D = (1/2) / cos M`:

`cos D = (1/2) / (sqrt(3)/ (2 sqrt 2)) = (1/2) * (2 sqrt 2)/ sqrt(3) = sqrt 2 / sqrt 3`

Now, the difference:

`cos(a - b) = cos(2D) = 2 cos^2 D - 1`

Compute:

`cos^2 D = (sqrt 2 / sqrt 3)^2 = 2/3`

So:

`cos(a - b) = 2 * (2/3) - 1 = 4/3 - 1 = 1/3`

This matches the numerical answer `1/3`.

Thus, the closed form answer:

`cos(a - b) = 1/3`

Now, in Lean, the syntax should be:

```lean
(1 / 3)
```

with no colon.

**Final answer:** <<<1 / 3>>>

This matches the style and expectations in Lean, providing a neat, directly computed answer consistent with the derivation.
