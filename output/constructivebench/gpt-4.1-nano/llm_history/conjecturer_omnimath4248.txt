The conditions imply the equality of sums and sums of squares of a, b, c and their reciprocals. For real solutions satisfying these symmetric equations, the potential solutions are symmetric or specific scalar multiples. By symmetry and typical algebraic results, the solutions are where a, b, c are equal or negatives satisfying the sum constraints. Final candidates include tuples with a = b = c = 1, or permutations with a = b = c = -1, satisfying the equations.
