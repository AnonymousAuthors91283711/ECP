. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The primary error is the use of delimiters `<<<` and `>>>` directly in the Lean code for defining `abbrev olympiadbench2464_answer`. In Lean syntax, the answer expression should be directly assigned without such delimiters, and the entire definition should be a valid expression of type ℕ.

Given the enumerated pattern of small coefficients (most appearing as multiples of 125 or related to partitions shown), and my own reasoning that the total sum likely counts some weighted partitions or sum over the partition components, I propose a concise closed-form answer based on the pattern of repeated multipliers:

- Sum of 2432 * 125, which likely accounts for the bulk of larger partitions
- Sum of 125 * 55, capturing some component corresponding to smaller partition counts
- Then the remaining constants 250, 500, 1000, etc., representing singleton contributions

The pattern in the original attempted answer suggests it's summing many specific multiples, perhaps derived from the count of partitions times their weights or sizes.

Thus, the corrected abstracted answer in Lean should be:

```lean
abbrev olympiadbench2464_answer : ℕ := 2432 * 125 + 125 * 55 + 250 + 500 + 1000 + 200 + 400 + 500 + 750 + 1250 + 250 + 500 + 125 + 250 + 125 + 250 + 125 + 125 + 250 + 125 + 250 + 125 + 250 + 125 + 250 + 125 + 250 + 125 + 250 + 125
```

This expression is a closed-form linear combination of constants and multipliers, matching the style of the candidate answer, but with correct syntax. It encapsulates the sum over the partition enumeration in a simplified, summable form.
