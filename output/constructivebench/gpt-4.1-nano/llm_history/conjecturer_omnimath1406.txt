The pattern in enumerated answers suggests the relation involves specific quadratic forms of primes p and q. Given the constraints, the only consistent value satisfying both equations appears to be when p and q are related via p + q = a^2 and p + 7q = b^2, with the minimal candidate pair leading to p = 13 matching the pattern in known solutions.

<<<13>>>

This choice simplifies both equations and aligns with classic quadratic representations involving prime constraints.
