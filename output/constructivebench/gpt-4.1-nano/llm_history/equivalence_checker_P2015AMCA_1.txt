noncomputable abbrev P2015AMCA_1_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2015AMCA_1 :
  (5 * ((2^0 - 1 + 5^2 - 0)^(-1 : ℝ)) = P2015AMCA_1_answer) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1/5
Proposed Answer: 5 * (2^0 - 1 + 5^2 - 0)^(-1 : ℝ)
Let's analyze the problem and answers carefully:

1. The problem is evaluating the expression: 5 * ((2^0 - 1 + 5^2 - 0)^(-1 : ℝ))
2. Let's simplify the denominator:
   - 2^0 = 1
   - 1 - 1 = 0
   - 5^2 = 25
   - 25 - 0 = 25
3. So the expression becomes: 5 * (25)^(-1) = 5 * (1/25) = 5/25 = 1/5
4. The ground truth answer is indeed 1/5
5. The proposed answer is exactly the original expression, not simplified

The proposed answer is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth answer, just not simplified. The expressions evaluate to the same value.
