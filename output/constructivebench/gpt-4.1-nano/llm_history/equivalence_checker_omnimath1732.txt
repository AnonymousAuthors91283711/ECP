Ground Truth Answer: {(-20, 28, 38), (-20, 38, 28), (28, -20, 38), (28, 38, -20), (38, -20, 28), (38, 28, -20)}
Proposed Answer: { (a, b, c) | ∃ x y z, a = 2 * x - 42 ∧ b = 2 * y - 13 ∧ c = 2 * z - 37 }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem states that the set {(a+b)/2 + c, (a+c)/2 + b, (b+c)/2 + a} should equal {42, 13, 37}.

2. The ground truth answer provides specific integer solutions that satisfy this condition.

3. The proposed answer gives a parametric solution where a, b, c are expressed in terms of x, y, z.

Looking at the ground truth solutions:
- For (-20, 28, 38):
  (a+b)/2 + c = (-20+28)/2 + 38 = 4 + 38 = 42
  (a+c)/2 + b = (-20+38)/2 + 28 = 9 + 28 = 37
  (b+c)/2 + a = (28+38)/2 + (-20) = 33 + (-20) = 13

This matches {42, 13, 37}. All other ground truth solutions are permutations of these values.

The proposed answer gives a general form. Let's test if it includes the ground truth solutions:
For (-20, 28, 38):
- a = -20 = 2*11 - 42 (x=11)
- b = 28 = 2*20.5 - 13 (y=20.5)
But y must be integer since b must be integer, and 20.5 is not integer. Therefore, the proposed solution doesn't include all ground truth solutions.
