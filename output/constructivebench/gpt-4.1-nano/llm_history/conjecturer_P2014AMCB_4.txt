abbrev P2014AMCB_4_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2014AMCB_4 (m b : ℚ) (hm : m > 0) (hb : b > 0) :
  (4 * m + 3 * b) * 2 = 2 * m + 16 * b ↔ m = P2014AMCB_4_answer * b := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Since the equation simplifies to a linear relation in m and b, solving algebraically yields m in terms of b. The key is to isolate m, giving \( m = \frac{10b}{4} = \frac{5b}{2} \).  
Final answer:
<<<(5/2)>>>
