The sequence satisfies both arithmetic and geometric properties: difference d and ratio r. From the geometric condition, a pattern emerges: a 6 = a 2 * r^4. Since a 2 = a 1 * r, then a 6 = a 1 * r^5. For a 4 = a 1 * s, and also a 4 = a 1 + 3d, the compatibility of linear and geometric progressions implies the ratio power relation: s = r^m, and the linear term relates to these via constraint involving d and r. The plausible solutions are those where k is a multiple of 5, as the geometric pattern repeats every 5 steps, while the sequence increments linearly. Therefore, the set of all such k is {5 * n | n ≥ 1}.
