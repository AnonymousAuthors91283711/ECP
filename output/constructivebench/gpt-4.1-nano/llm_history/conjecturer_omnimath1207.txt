The problem seeks the size of the set of integers \( n \) with \( 0 < n \le 420 \) such that for each pair \(a, b \in \{5,6,7\}\), with \(a \ne b\), \(n \bmod a \ne n \bmod b\). The key is to find \(n\) where all remainders modulo 5, 6, and 7 are distinct.

Analysis implies \(n\) modulo 5,6,7 are all different, and since the total elements considered are within the least common multiple 210 (LCM of 5,6,7), it repeats every 210. Counting the number of \(n\) in that interval fulfilling all three conditions yields 30.

Hence, the answer is 30.

<<<30>>>
