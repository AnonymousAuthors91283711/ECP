  (digits 10 (888888 * 9999999)).sum = olympiadbench2733_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sum of digits in the product \(888888 \times 9999999\) simplifies by recognizing patterns with repunits and distributions of digits; the pattern suggests the sum of digits total to \(648\). 

<<<648>>>

This value is deduced from typical digit sum patterns for repeated 8s and 9s, consistent across similar problems.
