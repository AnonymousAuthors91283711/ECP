  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 2024 ∣ n!} P2024AMCA_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern in the enumerated answers and the nature of least n such that 2024 divides n!, the smallest such n is the smallest n τhat ensures 2024 divides n!. Factoring 2024 = 8 * 253 = 2^3 * 11 * 23, we need n ≥ max(3, 23, 11) = 23. As n! contains these primes in sufficient power starting at 23, the minimal n is 23.
