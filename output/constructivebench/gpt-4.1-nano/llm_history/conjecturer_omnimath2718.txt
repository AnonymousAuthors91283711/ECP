The pattern suggests the calculation of the difference between positive and negative odd numbers equaling a particular value. The sequence 3 - 5 + 7 simplifies to 3 - 5 + 7 = (3 - 5) + 7 = -2 + 7 = 5. The equation states 3 - 5 + 7 = 6 - x, so 5 = 6 - x, thus x = 6 - 5 = 1. No pattern indicates involving complexities beyond simple algebra.
