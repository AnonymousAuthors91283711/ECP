Based on the functional equation and the pattern in enumerated answers, the function f likely simplifies to a linear form, and the value at 4 can be expressed explicitly. The pattern suggests a closed-form involving rational functions. 

The final value appears to be \(\frac{33}{2}\), as consistent with the pattern and the logical deduction from the functional equation.

<<<(33 / 2)>>>
