Ground Truth Answer: {-2, -1, 1, 2}
Proposed Answer: {k : ℤ | k ≠ 0 ∧ abs k < 3}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all non-zero integer values of k where the quadratic equation kx² + 6x + k = 0 has two distinct real roots.

2. For a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 to have two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be positive: b² - 4ac > 0.

3. Applying this to our equation: 6² - 4*k*k > 0 → 36 - 4k² > 0 → 9 - k² > 0 → k² < 9 → -3 < k < 3.

4. The ground truth answer gives the specific integer solutions within this range: {-2, -1, 1, 2}.

5. The proposed answer gives {k : ℤ | k ≠ 0 ∧ abs k < 3}, which is equivalent to all non-zero integers between -3 and 3, i.e., {-2, -1, 1, 2}.

The proposed answer is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth answer, just expressed in a different form (set builder notation vs explicit enumeration).
