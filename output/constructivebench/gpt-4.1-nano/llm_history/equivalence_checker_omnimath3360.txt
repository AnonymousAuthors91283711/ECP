  ∃! x, x * ⌊x * ⌊x * ⌊x * ⌊x⌋⌋⌋⌋ = 122 ∧ x = omnimath3360_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 122 / 41
Proposed Answer: 3.4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a unique real number x that satisfies the nested floor equation x * ⌊x * ⌊x * ⌊x * ⌊x⌋⌋⌋⌋ = 122.

2. The ground truth answer is 122/41, which is approximately 2.9756.

3. The proposed answer is 3.4.

Now let's test the proposed answer:
- ⌊3.4⌋ = 3
- 3.4 * 3 = 10.2
- ⌊10.2⌋ = 10
- 3.4 * 10 = 34
- ⌊34⌋ = 34
- 3.4 * 34 = 115.6
- ⌊115.6⌋ = 115
- 3.4 * 115 = 391, which is not equal to 122.

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the equation, while the ground truth answer does (as 122/41 ≈ 2.9756 works when you compute the nested floors).
