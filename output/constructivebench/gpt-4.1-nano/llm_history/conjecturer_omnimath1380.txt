theorem omnimath1380 (e f : ℝ) 
  (h1 : e / f = 3 / 4) 
  (h2 : sqrt (e^2 + f^2) = 15) 
  : e * f = omnimath1380_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests e and f form a right triangle with hypotenuse 15, and their ratio e/f=3/4 indicates a scaled (3-4-5) right triangle. Calculating e*f from this, x=3k, y=4k, hyp=5k=15 → k=3, so e=9, f=12, e*f=108. 

ŁFinal answer:
<<<108>>>
