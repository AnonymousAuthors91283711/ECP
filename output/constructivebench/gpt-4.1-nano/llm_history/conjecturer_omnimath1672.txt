The set contains the maximum n such that 2007^n divides 2007! with n ≤ log(2007!), which is less than or equal to 2007. The exponent is bounded by the sum of floors of divisions 2007! by powers of 2007, totaling the sum up to the maximum n where 2007^n ≤ 2007!. Therefore, the answer is 2007. 

<<<2007>>>
