  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (digits 10 n).sum = 20 ∧ (digits 10 (n + 864)).sum = 20} P2015AIMEI_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The condition specifies two numbers with digit sums equal to 20, separated by 864. Recognizing that sum of digits is unaffected by modulo 9, we seek numbers congruent modulo 9, with their digit sums matching 20, which is congruent to 2 modulo 9. The minimal positive difference implies the number itself has the same digit sum.

Given the minimal solution structure, the smallest positive n satisfying the given conditions, considering the digit sum constraints and the modular relations, is 108.

Therefore, the minimal such n is 108.
