The pattern suggests summing powers with binomial coefficients leading to a simplified expression involving powers of 2 and 3. Since \(3^{127} + 2^{127}\) directly matches the sum of two exponential terms without additional combinatorial factors, the closed-form answer is simply their sum:

<<<3^127 + 2^127>>>
