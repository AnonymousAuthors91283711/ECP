The problem asks for the least positive integer divisible by 60, 84, and 140. The answer is the least common multiple of these numbers. The prime factorizations are:
- 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5
- 84 = 2^2 * 3 * 7
- 140 = 2^2 * 5 * 7
The LCM is 2^2 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 420.

The task is to find the smallest positive integer divisible by 60, 84, and 140, which is their least common multiple (LCM). The prime factorizations are correct:
- 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5
- 84 = 2^2 * 3 * 7
- 140 = 2^2 * 5 * 7

The LCM takes the highest powers of primes appearing:
- 2^2 (from all)
- 3 (from 60 and 84)
- 5 (from 60 and 140)
- 7 (from 84 and 140)

Thus, LCM = 2^2 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 4 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 420.

In Lean, representing this as a constant with the correct type ℕ:

<<<420>>>

Explanations:
- Use 420 directly, as it's the LCM.
- No need to define a complicated expression, as the answer is a fixed number.
- The previous error was caused by an incorrect syntax or unprocessed comment; simply providing the numeric value fixes the error.
- Since the problem asks for a minimal positive integer divisible by all three, 420 is the minimal such number.

This satisfies the requirements for a correct, closed-form answer in Lean.
