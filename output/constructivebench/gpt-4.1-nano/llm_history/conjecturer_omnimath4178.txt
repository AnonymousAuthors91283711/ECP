The minimal constant C is achieved when the differences are maximized, which occurs for the ratios involving the extremal values of a_i. Given positivity and 5-dimensional vectors, the worst-case ratio difference is when a_i takes on minimal and maximal positive values with maximally separated ratios. Selecting these extremal points yields C = 1 + 2 / (max(a_i)/min(a_i) - 1). Simplifying, the minimal value is 1, as ratios can approach 1 from above, but the supremum of the difference is 1. Thus, the least such constant is 1.
