theorem mathodyssey182 (x : ℝ) : 
  4 * (x + 4) = 24 + 3 * (2 * x - 2) ↔ x = mathodyssey182_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: -1
Proposed Answer: (-4: ℝ)
Let's analyze the problem and both answers:

1. The problem is to solve the equation: 4*(x + 4) = 24 + 3*(2x - 2) for x ∈ ℝ
2. Let's solve it step by step:
   - Expand both sides: 4x + 16 = 24 + 6x - 6
   - Simplify right side: 4x + 16 = 18 + 6x
   - Move terms: 16 - 18 = 6x - 4x
   - Simplify: -2 = 2x
   - Final solution: x = -1

The ground truth answer is indeed x = -1. The proposed answer is x = -4.

Let's verify x = -4 in the original equation:
Left side: 4*(-4 + 4) = 4*0 = 0
Right side: 24 + 3*(2*(-4) - 2) = 24 + 3*(-10) = 24 - 30 = -6
0 ≠ -6, so x = -4 is incorrect.
