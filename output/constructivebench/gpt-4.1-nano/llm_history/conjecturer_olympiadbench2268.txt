The expression f(x) = (sin x)^2 - 2 sin x + 2 can be rewritten as a quadratic in t = sin x: t^2 - 2t + 2. The quadratic reaches its minimum at t = 1, giving minimum value 1. Since |sin x| ≤ 1, the maximum value occurs when |sin x| = 1, i.e., at sin x = ±1, giving the same value 1. 

Answer: <<< (1, 1) >>>
