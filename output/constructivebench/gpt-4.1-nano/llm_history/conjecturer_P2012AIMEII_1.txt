Given the equation \(20m + 12n = 2012\) with positive integers \(m, n\), factor out 4: \(4(5m + 3n) = 2012\). Since \(2012/4 = 503\), rewrite as \(5m + 3n = 503\). For positive \(m, n\), the minimal solutions satisfy \(m \leq 503/5\), \(n \leq 503/3\). Since \(5m + 3n = 503\), \(n = (503 - 5m)/3\) must be positive and integer, i.e., \(503 - 5m \equiv 0 \pmod 3\), with \(0 < m \leq 100\). The congruence simplifies to \(2m \equiv 2 \pmod 3\), so \(m \equiv 1 \pmod 3\). For each such \(m\), \(n = (503 - 5m)/3\), positive and integral. Count solutions with \(m \equiv 1 \pmod 3\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 100\), which occur at \(m \equiv 1 \pmod 3\), \(m = 1, 4, 7, ..., 100\). Last \(m\) is 100, starting at 1, incremented by 3, number of terms: \(\frac{100 - 1}{3} + 1 = 34\). Therefore, total solutions is 34.

Final answer:
<<<34>>>
