The pattern suggests that the solutions are quadratic functions y ↦ a x² + b. Plugging f(x) = k x² into the functional equation simplifies and confirms that any quadratic with zero linear term fits. Thus, the set includes functions f(x) = c x² for c ∈ ℝ.

The error arises because in Lean, set notation with element notation must use a syntax like `{ x | property }`, where `property` is a predicate. When describing a set of functions, the proper way is to define it as `{ f | ∀ x, f x = expression }`, or directly as a set of functions using a predicate that describes their form. The initial answer attempts to write `{ λ x, c * x * x | c ∈ ℝ }` as if it's a set of functions, but in Lean, to define a set of functions parameterized by a real constant `c`, we need to write it as `{ f | ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ x, f x = c * x * x }`. This correctly constrains the set to quadratic functions with coefficient `c`. 

Given the pattern from the enumerated answers, the set should be all functions of the form `λ x, c * x^2` for some `c ∈ ℝ`.

Thus, the fixed answer is:

<<<{ f | ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ x : ℝ, f x = c * x ^ 2 }>>>

This layout is the proper Lean syntax for a set of functions of a specific form parametrized by `c`. It is general and captures all quadratic functions of the form `c * x^2`.

**Summary:** The main fix involves changing the set comprehension syntax to correctly include an existential quantifier over `c`, and an explicit universal quantifier over `x`, as per Lean syntax conventions in mathlib.
