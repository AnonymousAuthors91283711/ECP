The problem is examining the existence of a composite number n such that both n and n-2 are composite, which is related to the twin composite numbers. The well-known smallest twin composite numbers are 8 and 9 (since 8 and 6 are not twins). The smallest such n in this context is 9, which satisfies the composite conditions. The answer, based on the pattern, is the smallest such number, which is 9.
