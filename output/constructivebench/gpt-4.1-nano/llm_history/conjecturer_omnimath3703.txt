Given the inequality and the set, the goal indicates the set contains the values of \( a \) for which there exists a function \( f \) satisfying \( x + a \cdot f y \le y + f (f x) \) universally.

Based on typical solutions involving linear functions or constant functions that satisfy such inequalities, the critical \( a \) appears constrained, possibly to the real line where the inequality holds via \( a \) being within some bounds like \(-1 \le a \le 1\).

Thus, a plausible closed-form set for \( a \) (without particular \( f \)) is:

<<<{a : ℝ | -1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 1}>>>
