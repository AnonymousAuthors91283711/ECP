abbrev omnimath2766_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2766 : 
  ∀ x : ℝ, (1 + 3 + x) / 3 = 3 ↔ x = omnimath2766_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The given equation is (1 + 3 + x) / 3 = 3, which simplifies to (4 + x) / 3 = 3, so x = 3*3 - 4 = 9 - 4 = 5. Thus, omnimath2766_answer = 5.  
Final answer: <<<5>>>
