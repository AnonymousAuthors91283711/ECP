The problem counts 5-element subsets of a 14-element set with neighboring elements. Since the set size is 14, the pairs with consecutive elements are (1,2), (2,3), ..., (13,14). The number of such 5-element subsets with at least one consecutive pair is obtained via inclusion-exclusion, resulting in 136. 

Final answer in Lean:

<<<136>>>
