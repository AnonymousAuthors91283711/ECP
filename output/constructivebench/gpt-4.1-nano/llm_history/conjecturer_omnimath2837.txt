theorem omnimath2837 :
  (8 * 6 - 4 / 2 : ℝ) = omnimath2837_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the answer involves basic arithmetic with the numbers 8, 6, and 4/2. Calculation: 8*6 - 4/2 = 48 - 2 = 46. Thus, the closed form is simply that value. 

<<<46>>>
