abbrev omnimath2748_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2748 :
  2 * 0 + 2 * 4 = omnimath2748_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern in the enumerated answers and the structure of the problem, the answer appears to be related to the sum of the multiplications on the left side. The first term is 0, which contributes nothing, and 2 * 4 is 8. Therefore, summing these yields 8. The correct closed-form consistent with the pattern and the given sum is 8. 

<<<8>>>
