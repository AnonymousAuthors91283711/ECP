Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us the equation 2x² = 9x - 4 with the constraint x ≠ 4.
2. Solving the quadratic equation: 2x² - 9x + 4 = 0
3. Solutions are x = [9 ± √(81 - 32)]/4 = [9 ± 7]/4
4. So x = 4 or x = 0.5
5. But x ≠ 4 is given, so only x = 0.5 is valid
6. Now compute 2x: 2*0.5 = 1

The ground truth answer is 1, which is correct.
The proposed answer is 4, which would correspond to x=2, but:
- x=2 doesn't satisfy the original equation (2*4 = 9*2 - 4 → 8 = 14 is false)
- x=4 was explicitly excluded

<<<False>>>
