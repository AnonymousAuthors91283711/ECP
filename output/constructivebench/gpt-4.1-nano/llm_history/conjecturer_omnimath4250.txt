The problem involves combinatorial possibilities of sequences related to k within bounds and an n parameter. Observing the pattern, the relevant set of k values likely corresponds to those associated with the integer intervals between 1 and 2n, excluding certain values. Based on enumerations, a plausible continuous range is from 1 up to n + 1.
