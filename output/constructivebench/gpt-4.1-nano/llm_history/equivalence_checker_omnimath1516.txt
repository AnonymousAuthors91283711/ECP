Ground Truth Answer: 23/30
Proposed Answer: 1/2
Let me analyze this problem carefully.

The problem defines a recursive probability function p(n) where:
- p(0) = p(1) = 1
- For n+1, the probability is a combination of staying (with probability stayProb) and switching (with probability switchProb)

The ground truth answer for p(15) is 23/30 ≈ 0.7667, while the proposed answer is 1/2 = 0.5.

Let's think about the behavior:
- The initial probabilities are 1 (certainty)
- As n increases, the switch probability decreases rapidly (as 1/(2n²))
- The recursion shows that p(n) tends to stay high because switching becomes increasingly unlikely

The proposed answer of 1/2 is clearly too low compared to the ground truth of 23/30. The probabilities should remain significantly above 1/2 given the defined recursion and rapidly decreasing switch probabilities.
