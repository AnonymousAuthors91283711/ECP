The problem models a climbing scenario with alternating upward and downward segments, with total time \( T \). Since \( T = 10 \), the total climb considers full cycles plus remaining climb or descent. The pattern indicates total ascent += \( 2T \) for full cycles, plus remaining climb, which depends on the remaining time.

The total climb after full cycles is \( 2T \times \lfloor \frac{total_time}{cycle_time} \rfloor \). The remaining climb adds a maximum of \( T \) if the remaining time is less than or equal to the ascent period or a partial climb if it exceeds.

Since the pattern in enumerated answers suggests the total climb jumps to \( 2T \) times full cycles plus the remaining climb, we conclude the total climb height is:

\(\text{full\_cycles} \times 2T + \text{remaining\_climb}\)

Given \( T = 10 \),
the total climb after considering full cycles and remaining climb simplifies to \( 2 \times 10 \times \lfloor \frac{ total\_time }{ cycle\_time } \rfloor + \text{remaining\_climb} \),

which is:

<<<(full_cycles * 2 * T) + remaining_climb>>>

with \( T = 10 \).

In structured form:

<<<(full_cycles * 20) + remaining_climb>>>
