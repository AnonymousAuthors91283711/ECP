abbrev omnimath1441_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1441 (x : ℝ) (hx : x > 256^2) :
    logb 256 (logb 256 (logb 256 x)) = logb (256^2) (logb (256^2) (logb (256^2) x)) ↔ x = omnimath1441_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern in the enumerated answers suggests a solution involving powers of 256 and nested logs. The equality of triple nested logs indicates a specific form where x equals a power of 256. Simplifying the nested logs, the answer must be x = 256^{256^{256}}.
