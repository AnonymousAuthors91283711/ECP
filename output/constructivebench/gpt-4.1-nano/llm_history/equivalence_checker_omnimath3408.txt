Ground Truth Answer: 7 * 2023
Proposed Answer: 2023^2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest positive natural number n that is:
   - A perfect square (n = k² for some k)
   - Divisible by 2023 (2023 ∣ n)

2. Ground Truth Answer: 7 × 2023 = 14161
   - 14161 = 119² (perfect square)
   - 2023 × 7 = 14161 (divisible by 2023)
   - This is indeed the smallest such number since 2023 = 7 × 17² and we need at least one more 7 to make a perfect square

3. Proposed Answer: 2023²
   - While 2023² is a perfect square and divisible by 2023, it's much larger than 7 × 2023
   - 2023² = 2023 × 2023 = 4,092,529
   - This is not the smallest number satisfying the conditions

The proposed answer is incorrect because it doesn't give the smallest such number. The ground truth answer correctly identifies the minimal solution.
