The divisor d divides all products (n*k + 1) for n in 1..2016 and k in 0..16. By analyzing patterns, the maximum such divisor not exceeding all of these products naturally corresponds to the least common multiple (LCM) over all such n in the range and the expressions involved, which simplifies to 17.
