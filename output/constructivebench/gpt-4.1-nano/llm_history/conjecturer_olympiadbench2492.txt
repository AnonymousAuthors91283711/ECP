The pattern from enumeration suggests the fraction simplifies to 1/2, as roughly half of the pairs have \(a^b\) even, considering the parity conditions. Since \(a^b\) is even iff \(a\) is even, the count relates directly to the number of even \(a\) in \(A\). There are 2 even \(a\) (2,4) out of 5, so probability = \(2/5\). However, the detailed count after symmetric considerations aligns with \(\frac{1}{2}\).

. Enumerated Answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Given the enumeration pattern, the probability that \(a^b\) is even depends solely on whether \(a\) is even, because \(a^b\) is even iff \(a\) is even. In \(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\), two are even (2 and 4) and three are odd (1, 3, 5). For each fixed \(a\), the probability that \(a^b\) is even is:

- If \(a\) is even: all \(b\) in \(B\) (3 elements) make \(a^b\) even, because even to any power is even.
- If \(a\) is odd: \(a^b\) is odd iff \(b\) is odd; i.e., when \(b\) is odd, \(a^b\) is odd, otherwise even. Since all \(b \in B\) are \(\{6,7,8\}\), with 2 even and 1 odd, the probability that \(a^b\) is even given \(a\) odd is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

Summing over all \(a\in A\):

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 1 + \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{5} + \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

Thus, the probability that \(a^b\) is even is \(\frac{4}{5}\).
