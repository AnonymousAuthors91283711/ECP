theorem omnimath4408 :
  (∃ S : Finset ℕ,
    S.card = 1983 ∧
    (∀ n ∈ S, n > 0 ∧ n ≤ 10 ^ 5) ∧
    (∀ a ∈ S, ∀ b ∈ S, ∀ c ∈ S, (a < b ∧ b < c) → (c - b = b - a → False))) ↔ omnimath4408_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: Prop
The pattern indicates the set S must contain distinct positive integers within 1 to 10^5, with no 3-term arithmetic progressions; thus, it corresponds to a large subset avoiding k-term arithmetic progressions. By known combinatorial bounds (e.g., Behrend's construction), such sets can have size close to a constant times n / log n. The specific enumeration suggests a minimal construction satisfying the size 1983 limit with no 3-term APs for a subset of {1,..,10^5}.

Final answer:
<<<∃ S : Finset ℕ, S.card = 1983 ∧ (∀ n ∈ S, 1 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 10^5) ∧ (∀ a ∈ S, ∀ b ∈ S, ∀ c ∈ S, (a < b ∧ b < c) → ¬(c - b = b - a))>>>
