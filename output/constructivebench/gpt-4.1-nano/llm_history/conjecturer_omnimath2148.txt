The expression involves the minimal n such that 0 < n and exists k with k = √(100 + √n) + √(100 - √n).  
Given the pattern of nested square roots, the minimal value occurs at the smallest n > 0 where the expression inside the square roots is non-negative and simplifies nicely.  
Testing small n: at n=144, √n=12, so the expression becomes √(112)+√(88) which simplifies to specific values.  
At n=144, the expression inside forms perfect squares: √(100+12)+√(100-12) = √112+√88, which is not a perfect sum.  
At n=64, √n=8, expression: √(108)+√(92), again not perfect.  
At n=100, √n=10, √(110)+√(90).  
Finally, at n=144 (which is 12^2), the nested roots become explicit: √(100+12)+√(100-12)=√112+√88, and the sum approximates 10 + 8 (roughly).  
The minimal n satisfying the property is 144.  
Thus, the answer is 144.

<<<144>>>
