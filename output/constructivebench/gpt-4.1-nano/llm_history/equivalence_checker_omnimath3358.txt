Ground Truth Answer: {2007, 2738, 3122}
Proposed Answer: { n | ∃ p q r : ℕ, p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ r.Prime ∧ n = p^2 * q * r ∧ φ n = 1332 }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer captures the general form of the solution set (numbers expressible as p²qr with p,q,r prime and Euler's totient φ(n)=1332), but it doesn't explicitly list the specific values {2007, 2738, 3122} that satisfy these conditions. The ground truth provides these concrete solutions while the proposed answer gives the defining conditions. They are equivalent in terms of describing the same set of numbers, but not identical in presentation.
