theorem P2003AMCB_19 :
  let S := {σ : Perm (Fin 5) | σ 0 ≠ 0}
  let T := {σ ∈ S | σ 1 = 1}
  let p := (Set.ncard T : ℚ) / Set.ncard S
  ∃ a b : ℕ, Nat.Coprime a b ∧ p = a / b ∧ a + b = P2003AMCB_19_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests that from the enumerated answers, the ratio p simplifies to 2/5, and the sum a + b equals 7. Since coprime integers a, b with a/b = 2/5 fit this pattern, the natural numbers are (a, b) = (2, 5). 

Final answer: 
<<<7>>>
