abbrev omnimath2831_answer : ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath2831 (b : ℤ) (h : 3 ≠ b) : 
  (3 + b) / (3 - b) = -4 ↔ b = omnimath2831_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 5
Proposed Answer: -7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find an integer b (≠3) such that (3 + b)/(3 - b) = -4.

2. Let's solve the equation:
   (3 + b)/(3 - b) = -4
   => 3 + b = -4(3 - b)
   => 3 + b = -12 + 4b
   => 3 + 12 = 4b - b
   => 15 = 3b
   => b = 5

3. The ground truth answer is indeed 5, which we've verified.

4. The proposed answer is -7. Let's test this:
   (3 + (-7))/(3 - (-7)) = (-4)/10 = -0.4 ≠ -4

The proposed answer (-7) does not satisfy the equation, while the ground truth answer (5) does. They are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
