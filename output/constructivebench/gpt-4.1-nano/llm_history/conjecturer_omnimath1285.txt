  (a : ℕ → ℕ)

  (Nat.gcd (a 999) (a 2004) = omnimath1285_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern indicates the sequence defined by a recursive relation a(n+1) = (a n)^2 + 1 with initial a(0) = 1 suggests that each term is odd, thus their gcd is 1. 

Final answer: <<<1>>>
