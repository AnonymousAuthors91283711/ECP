The sequence defined by recurrence likely stabilizes or forms a pattern involving least common multiple and addition. Observations of initial terms (x 1=19, x 2=95) and the recurrence suggest the sequence's terms relate to the product of previous terms and their gcd/lcm relations. A pattern emerges: the sequence resembles the product of initial terms with powers of 5. Given the pattern, the answer for large n stabilizes to a product involving powers of 5. Based on the enumerated pattern, the guess is a power of 5 times the initial value 19.

Thus, the general formula could be: 19 * 5^{n-1}. For n=1995, the answer is 19 * 5^{1994}.

<<<19 * 5^(1994)>>>
