  (∑ x in Finset.filter (fun x => 10 ≤ x ∧ x ≤ 99 ∧ 109 % x = 4) (Finset.range 100), x) = omnimath2684_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: . Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem sums over two-digit x with 109 mod x = 4, i.e., 109 ≡ 4 mod x. Since 109 ≡ 4 mod x, x divides 105 (because 109 - 4 = 105). The two-digit divisors of 105 are 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 35, 105. Within range 10 to 99, divisors are 15, 21, 35. Sum is 15 + 21 + 35 = 71.
