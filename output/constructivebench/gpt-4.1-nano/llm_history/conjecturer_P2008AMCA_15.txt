The pattern suggests that the sum of large powers modulo 10 often simplifies to the last digit of a primary term, especially for expressions like \(a^2 + 2^a\). Recognizing the cyclicity of \(2^a \bmod 10\) and the last digit of \(2008^2\), the dominant contribution modulo 10 comes from \((2008^2 + 2^{2008})\). Since \(2008 \equiv 8 \pmod 10\), and \(8^2=64\) ends with 4, and \(2^{2008}\), which cycles every 4, has last digit 6, their sum ends with 0. Squaring it then ends with 0, and adding \(2^{2008^2 + 2^{2008}}\) which ends with 6, results in last digit 6. So, the answer is 6.

<<<6>>>
