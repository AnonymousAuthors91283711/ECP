abbrev P2021AMCB_22_answer : List ℕ → Prop := sorry
def beth_wins : List ℕ → Prop := by sorry
theorem P2021AMCB_22 (walls : List ℕ) :
  walls ∈ [[6, 1, 1], [6, 2, 1], [6, 2, 2], [6, 3, 1], [6, 3, 2]] → 
  beth_wins walls ↔ P2021AMCB_22_answer walls := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun walls => walls = [6, 2, 1]

/-- Predicate indicating whether Beth has a winning strategy from given position -/
Proposed Answer: fun walls => ∃ i, walls.get? i = some 6 ∧ ∀ j, j < walls.length ∧ j ≠ i → walls.get? j ≠ some 6
<<<False>>>
