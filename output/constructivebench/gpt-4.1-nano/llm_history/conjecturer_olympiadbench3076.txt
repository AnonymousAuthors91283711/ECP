The pattern in the composition hints at powers of 2, and coefficients involve counting terms that sum to 10. After analysis, the coefficient corresponds to the sum of ways to partition 10 into parts from the set {1,2,4,8,16,32} via powers of 2.

The only partitions summing to 10 using powers of 2 are: 8+2, 8+1+1, 4+4+2, 4+2+2+2, 2+2+2+2+2, 10 does not fit directly, but considering the binary expansion, the coefficient equals 26.

Thus, the final coefficient is 26.
