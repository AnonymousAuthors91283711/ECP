The problem describes two two-digit numbers \(a, b\) with digits \(c, d\). The key condition reduces to \(a \times (\text{reversed } b) = b \times (\text{reversed } a)\), which holds when the ratios \(a/b = (\text{reversed } a)/(\text{reversed } b)\) are equal. Simplifies to the pairs where \(a:b = c:d\), the ratio of the digits. The set includes pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a, b\) are reversals of the same digit ratio, including when \(a = b\).

Thus, the set is all pairs where \(a/b = c/d\), with \(a, b\) two-digit numbers and \(c, d\) their digits. Final form:

<<< {(a, b) | a, b ∈ ℕ, 10 ≤ a, b, a = 10 * c + d, b = 10 * d + c, c, d ∈ ℕ, c < 10, d < 10, a * (10 * d + c) = b * (10 * c + d)} >>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The core of the problem is identifying pairs \((a, b)\) of two-digit numbers with digits \(c, d\) such that \(a = 10c + d\) and \(b = 10d + c\), and satisfying the condition \(a \times (10d + c) = b \times (10c + d)\). Algebraically, the condition becomes:

\[ (10c + d)(10d + c) = (10d + c)(10c + d) \]

which simplifies to an equality always holding, implying the original condition reduces to the pairs where this relation holds, i.e., when \(a / b = c / d\), with \(a, b\) as reversed digits.

The pattern of solutions includes all pairs such that \((a, b)\) are reversals of each other, with the ratios of their digits \(c/d\) preserved. Since \(a\) and \(b\) are two-digit integers with digits \(c, d < 10\), and when \(c = d\), the pair \((a, b) = (11c, 11c)\) satisfies trivially.

Given these, the set of solutions encompasses all pairs where \(a, b\) are reversals, satisfying the proportionality condition \(a / b = c / d\):
- When \(c/d\) is in lowest terms, scaling gives the specific pairs.
- When \(c = d\), \(a = b\).

From the pattern, the set includes pairs where the digits \(c, d\) satisfy \(c, d < 10\), and the pair \((a, b)\) are related through this digit ratio.

Final Lean set expression:

<<<
{ p : ℕ × ℕ |
  ∃ c d : ℕ,
    c < 10 ∧ d < 10 ∧
    p.1 = 10 * c + d ∧
    p.2 = 10 * d + c ∧
    (10 * c + d) * (10 * d + c) = (10 * d + c) * (10 * c + d)
}
>>>

This captures exactly the pairs \((a, b)\) with digits \(c, d\), and the algebraic relation holds trivially, including the case \(a = b\). It generalizes all such pairs in closed form within the constraints.
