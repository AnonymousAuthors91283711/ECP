The set is all x with 40 < x < 60, since log(x-40) + log(60-x) < 2 simplifies to (x - 40)(60 - x) < e^2. The product (x - 40)(60 - x) is maximized at x = 50, giving 10 * 10 = 100 < e^2 ≈ 7.39, so inequality holds only near the endpoints. We find the x satisfying (x - 40)(60 - x) < e^2. For integers, x ∈ {41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59}. Count = 19. 

Answer:

<<<19>>>
