Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (1 / 6)^n
Proposed Answer:  fun n => (2 : ℚ)^n / n.factorial
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the value of a linear functional f evaluated at the constant function x_i = 5 for all i, given some special properties of f.

2. The ground truth answer suggests that f(constant 5) = (1/6)^n.

3. The proposed answer suggests f(constant 5) = 2^n / n!.

Let's think about the special case when n=1:
- Ground truth gives 1/6
- Proposed gives 2/1 = 2
These are clearly different, so the answers cannot be equivalent.

For n=2:
- Ground truth: (1/6)^2 = 1/36
- Proposed: 2^2/2 = 2
Again, different.

The answers are fundamentally different in their form and values. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth in any case.
