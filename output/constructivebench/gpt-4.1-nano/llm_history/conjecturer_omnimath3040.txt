The equation simplifies to P + Q + R = 19, with all digits distinct and less than 10; P, Q, R are digits. The only solutions are permutations of {1, 8, 10} with sum 19, but since digits are less than 10, valid are {1,8,10}: discard 10. Valid combinations are permutations of {1,8, respectively}. The sum P+Q+R=19** and the digits are distinct and in [0..9]. From enumerations, the sum is always 19.

Answer: <<<19>>>
