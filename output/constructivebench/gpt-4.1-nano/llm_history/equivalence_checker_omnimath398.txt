Ground Truth Answer: 4012013006001
Proposed Answer: (2001 ^ 2 * 2002 ^ 2) / 4
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. The sum of cubes of first n natural numbers is given by the formula (n(n+1)/2)^2. For n=2001, this becomes (2001*2002/2)^2 = (2001*2002)^2/4, which matches the proposed answer. Calculating this gives exactly 4012013006001, the ground truth answer.
