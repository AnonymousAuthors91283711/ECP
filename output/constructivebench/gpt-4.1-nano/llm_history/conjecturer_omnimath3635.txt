Since the injectivity implies a maximum count of distinct images, the largest size is reached when the filter's univ set covers the entire domain, suggesting (m, n) with the product being the maximal block count. The pattern indicates that (m, n) where both are ≥ 1 fits the structure, and the maximum set is when these cases are valid. Patterning from the enumerated answer, the general set can be expressed as pairs where the product equals the cardinality constraints, leading to the following closed form:

<<<{(m, n) | 1 ≤ m ∧ 1 ≤ n}>>>
