The problem appears to involve irrational and rational solutions to an algebraic system involving a real number \( r \). The key equations are:
\[
4 + d = 4 r \quad\text{and}\quad 4 r + d = 4 r^2
\]
We are asked to find all \( r \) such that there exists some \( d \) satisfying these equations, and to enumerate potential \( r \)â€™s.

We can solve the equations explicitly for \( r \).

1. From the first equation:
\[
d = 4 r - 4
\]
2. Substitute into the second:
\[
4 r + (4 r - 4) = 4 r^2
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
8 r - 4 = 4 r^2
\]
Divide through by 4:
\[
2 r - 1 = r^2
\]
or
\[
r^2 - 2 r + 1 = 0
\]
which factors as:
\[
(r - 1)^2 = 0
\]
Thus, the only solution is \( r = 1 \).

Plugging back to verify \( d \):
\[
d = 4 \times 1 - 4 = 0
\]
which satisfies the second equation:
\[
4 \times 1 + 0 = 4 \times 1^2 = 4
\]

So, the only \( r \) satisfying the existential statement is \( r=1 \).

Here's a Python enumeration, though trivial here, to confirm this result.

```python
# Enumerate candidate r values in a small range around 1 to verify solutions
possible_r_values = [r / 10 for r in range(0, 21)]  # from 0.0 to 2.0 in steps of 0.1

for r in possible_r_values:
    # Solve for d using the first equation
    d = 4 * r - 4
    # Check the second equation
    if abs(4 * r + d - 4 * r ** 2) < 1e-8:
        print(f"r = {r:.1f} satisfies the equations with d = {d:.2f}")
# The only exact solution found should correspond to r=1.0
```

This code enumerates small rational candidates for \( r \), confirming that only \( r=1 \) satisfies the system exactly. The conclusion is:
