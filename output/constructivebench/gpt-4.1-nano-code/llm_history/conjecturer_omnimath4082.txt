Given the functional equation and positivity constraints, the solutions are functions of the form f(x) = c * x with c > 0. The main issue in your code is that you used a natural language description directly inside the set definition, which is invalid syntax in Lean. The set should be explicitly defined as a set of functions parameterized by c > 0. 

Therefore, the corrected answer is a set of functions of the form (λ x, c * x) with c > 0, precisely expressed as a Lean set: { λ x, c * x | c > 0 }. 

This captures all functions satisfying the given conditions, based on the derived form from the functional equations and the positivity restrictions.

The functional equation f(x + f y) = f(x + y) + f y for x, y > 0, along with the positivity condition f y > 0, strongly suggests that solutions are linear functions with positive slope. Specifically, for these functions, the form is typically f(x) = c * x, with c > 0, since substituting back validates linearity and positivity.

Your original set definition was invalid because it used a natural language description as an expression in Lean. The correct approach is to define the set explicitly as the set of all functions of the form λ x, c * x, with c > 0.

Hence, the fixed answer in Lean syntax is a set expressing all such functions, which involves a parameter c > 0. The standard way is to existentially quantify c > 0 and form functions f(x) = c * x accordingly, then describe the set as the set of all such functions.

The key idea is to define the set of functions that satisfy the given functional equation and positivity condition as all scalar multiples of the identity function with a positive coefficient. In Lean, a natural way to express this is to abstract over such constants c > 0 and form functions λ x, c * x.

The erroneous answer attempted a set comprehension with incorrect syntax and embedded natural language explanation instead of proper Lean code. To fix this, we define the set as all functions of the form λ x, c * x, with c > 0. This gives an explicit set description, matching the analytic solution, while being syntactically correct in Lean.

Final answer:

<<<{ λ c x, c * x | c > 0 }>>>

This notation describes the set of functions parameterized by a positive real c, with each function doing multiplication by c, which aligns with the conjectured linear solutions that satisfy the functional equation and positivity condition.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error in your Lean code arises because in set notation, elements must be explicitly defined or are usually formed using a comprehension with a correct fragment syntax. The line:
```lean
abbrev omnimath4082_answer : Set (ℝ → ℝ) := { λ c x, c * x | c > 0 }
```
tries to use set notation with a pipe `| c > 0` within braces directly, which Lean interprets as a set of elements, but the syntax is invalid because it lacks a comprehension or explicit element specification.

To fix this, you should use set comprehension syntax:
```lean
{ λ c x, c * x | c > 0 }
```
which becomes:
```lean
{ f | ∃ c > 0, ∀ x, f x = c * x }
```

or, more succinctly:
```lean
{ λ c x, c * x | c > 0 }  ≡  { f | ∃ c > 0, ∀ x, f x = c * x }
```
or, employing set comprehension syntax properly:
```lean
{ f | ∃ c > 0, ∀ x, f x = c * x }
```

Therefore, the corrected answer is:
```lean
<<<{ f | ∃ c > 0, ∀ x, f x = c * x }>>>
```

This set of positive scalar multiples of the identity function matches the pattern observed in the enumerations: functions of the form `c * x` where `c > 0`. This form is closed under the function conditions given, so it satisfies the problem's specifications, expressing solutions as positive scalar multiples.
