The problem involves computing \( 10! - 7! \times 6! \). To assist in conjecturing and verifying the answer, I'll write a Python script that enumerates candidate values for this expression, prioritizing exact integer results and printing each as soon as it is computed.

Since this is straightforward factorial arithmetic, we don't need extensive enumeration, just direct computation. The script will print intermediate results immediately upon computation and conclude with the exact result.

```python
import math

# Calculate factorials
factorial_10 = math.factorial(10)
factorial_7 = math.factorial(7)
factorial_6 = math.factorial(6)

# Print intermediate factorials
print("10! =", factorial_10)
print("7! =", factorial_7)
print("6! =", factorial_6)

# Compute the expression
result = factorial_10 - factorial_7 * factorial_6

# Output the result immediately
print("Result: 10! - 7! * 6! = ", result)
```
