The problem resembles a combinatorial counting challenge: counting the number of functions from a 6-element set to a 4-element set such that no two consecutive elements in a cycle (indices mod 6) map to the same element. This is equivalent to counting the number of "cyclic arrangements" with no adjacent repeats.

To enumerate solutions, we can model this as a counting problem of colorings around a circle with 4 colors, no two adjacent colors the same.

The number of such arrangements is well-known in combinatorics and can be computed using Burnsideâ€™s lemma or direct recurrence relations. For simplicity, I'll implement a brute-force enumeration over all functions from 6 to 4 (total 4^6 = 4096), filtering those with no consecutive repeats on the cycle.

Since the problem explicitly wants to find the exact count, I'll generate all functions, verify the adjacency constraints, and count.

This brute-force approach is efficient enough (checking 4096 functions is reasonable), and will produce the accurate count directly.

```python
# Enumerate all functions from 6 elements to 4 elements
# Count those with no pair of consecutive elements (indices mod 6) mapping to same value

def count_valid_colorings():
    total = 0
    for f0 in range(4):
        for f1 in range(4):
            for f2 in range(4):
                for f3 in range(4):
                    for f4 in range(4):
                        for f5 in range(4):
                            # Check adjacency: f[i] != f[(i+1)%6]
                            if (f0 != f1 and
                                f1 != f2 and
                                f2 != f3 and
                                f3 != f4 and
                                f4 != f5 and
                                f5 != f0):
                                total += 1
                            # Stream results as they are found
        # No need for early break; full enumeration keeps streaming
    return total

answer = count_valid_colorings()
print(answer)
```
