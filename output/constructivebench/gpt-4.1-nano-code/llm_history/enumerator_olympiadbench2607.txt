This problem asks to find the minimal value of \(k\) such that there exists a function \(g:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) satisfying two conditions: an inequality involving \(g\), and a minimality condition based on any other \(h\) satisfying the inequality. The exact minimal \(k\) is not given; instead, we need to systematically explore candidate \(k\) values.

Given the problem structure, the key constraints are:
- \(g x + g y > x^2\) for \(x,y > 0\).
- For any \(h\) satisfying the same inequality, the sum over \(h\) is at least as large as the sum over \(g\) for the first 20 integers.

To find the minimal \(k\), we can:
1. Generate functions \(g\) that meet the initial inequality.
2. For each \(g\), check its value at 14.
3. Record \(k = g(14)\) if the conditions are met.
4. Find the minimum such \(k\).

Since enumerating all functions explicitly is impossible, we pick small plausible \(g\) candidates constrained by the inequalities and try to find the smallest \(g(14)\).

Let's implement a simplified enumeration for plausible \(g\) values at 14, assuming some logical bounds based on the inequalities, and print candidate minimal \(k\).

```python
# Enum all plausible g(14) values starting from 1 upwards.
# For each candidate k, try to construct a g that satisfies the constraints.
# For simplicity, we approximate g with a linear growth: g(x) â‰¥ c * x^2, c > 0
# and g(14) = k. For each candidate, we check if an example g exists.
# Since the problem is complex, we limit search to manageable bounds.

    def g(x):
        return max(int(x**2 + 1), int(k / max(x,1)**0.5))
    # Check if g satisfies the inequality on small samples
    if not satisfies_g_conditions(g):
        continue
    # Check the minimal sum condition with a naive approach

            min_k_found = k

# Output the minimal found k

    print(f"Minimal k satisfying conditions: {min_k_found}")
