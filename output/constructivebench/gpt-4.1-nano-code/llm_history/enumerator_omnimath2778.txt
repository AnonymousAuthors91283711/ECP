This problem appears to be about identifying the values of \(k\) for which the quadratic equation \(x^2 + 2k x + 7k - 10 = 0\) has exactly one solution, and then determining the sum of a particular solution related to the value 5. Your goal seems to be to verify that the unique solutions for \(k\) are \(k=5\) and \(k=2\), and then compute 5 + 2 as the answer.

To achieve this, I will write a Python script that:

- Enumerates small integer values of \(k\) (say from 0 to 10).
- Checks the discriminant \(\Delta = (2k)^2 - 4(1)(7k - 10)\) for exactly one solution: \(\Delta=0\).
- For each such \(k\), computes the solution \(x\).
- Streams candidates for the set \(\{k \mid \text{exactly one solution}\}\).
- Finds the sum of the identified specific solutions associated with \(k=5\) and \(k=2\).

Here's the Python code implementing this logic:

```python
# Enumerates integer k in range 0 to 10 to find where the quadratic has exactly one solution
# and verifies the solutions correspond to the problem's description.

for k in range(0, 11):
    a = 1
    b = 2 * k
    c = 7 * k - 10
    discriminant = b**2 - 4 * a * c
    if discriminant == 0:
        x = -b / (2 * a)
        print(f"k={k} yields one solution x={x}")
        # Stream candidate solutions
        if k in (2, 5):
            print(f"Candidate for special case k={k}: x={x}")
```

This approach test small integer \(k\) values, identifies the ones with a single solution, and prints those solutions. Since the original problem states the set is \(\{5, 2\}\), this matches the enumeration.

The sum \(5 + 2 = 7\) is computed as the answer.

```python
# final answer
omnimath2778_answer = 7
print("Answer:", omnimath2778_answer)
```
