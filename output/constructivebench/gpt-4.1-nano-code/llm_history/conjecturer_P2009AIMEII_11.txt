theorem P2009AIMEII_11 :
  IsGreatest {s : ℕ | ∃ m n : ℕ, m ≥ n ∧ 0 < n ∧ 
    Set.Finite {k : ℕ | 0 < k ∧ |log m - log k| < log n} ∧
    Nat.card {k : ℕ | 0 < k ∧ |log m - log k| < log n} = 50 ∧
    s = m * n} P2009AIMEII_11_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found candidate: m=34, n=2, s=68
Found candidate: m=19, n=3, s=57
Maximum s with exactly 50 such k: 68. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests maximizing s = m * n with m ≥ n ≥ 1, and exactly 50 k satisfy |log m - log k| < log n, implying k in (m / n, m n). The maximum scaled value occurs at m=34, n=2, giving s=68.
