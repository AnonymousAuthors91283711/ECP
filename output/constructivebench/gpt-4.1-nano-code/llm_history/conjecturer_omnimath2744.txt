The core issue in the proposed answer is that it uses variables 'a' and 'b' directly without binding them as parameters or constants, leading to an error since Lean does not recognize 'a' and 'b' within that context. To fix this, we should express the final answer as a function of 'a' and 'b' that will be chosen corresponding to the specific subset as indicated in the enumerated solutions.

Given the pattern from the enumerated solutions, each subset's product factors into a form similar to 15015, 45045, 75075, etc., with the structure revealing that the product equals (product over the subset elements) = 10000 * a + 1000 * b, plus possibly a small correction involving 'a' and 'b'. Examining the patterns, the constants align with the subsets: the product seems to calculate to '10000 * a + 1000 * b + 10 * a + b', which simplifies to '(10000 + 10)*a + (1000 + 1)*b' = 10010 * a + 1001 * b.

Therefore, the correct closed-form expression should be a function parameterized by 'a' and 'b' as:

<<<fun a b => 10010 * a + 1001 * b>>>

Note that 'a' and 'b' are implicitly to be chosen to correspond to the encoded product as per the problem's context, which is consistent with the pattern observed.

Final Answer:

The key issue is that Lean expects the abbreviation `omnimath2744_answer` to be a specific `ℕ` value, not a function `(a b) => ...`. The provided expression `fun a b => 10010 * a + 1001 * b` is a lambda function, which has a function type, causing the type mismatch error. Since from the pattern in the enumerated answers, the answer appears to be a specific numerical expression (a product or sum) that encodes the parameters `a` and `b`, we should provide a concrete `ℕ` value rather than a function.

Looking at the example enumerated answers, they seem to express the product as a fixed sum involving `a` and `b`: specifically, the product `10000 * a + 1000 * b + ...`. The exercises and the pattern in the options suggest the answer encodes the product `∏ n in s, n`, which in the representative answer is given as `10010 * a + 1001 * b`. When simplified, the precise total product is a fixed number.

From the above, the simplest consistent approach is to select a specific `a` and `b` identified in the enumerated answers, for example the pair `(a=7, b=5)`, which corresponds to the subset `[3, 5, 7, 11, 65]` with product `75075`. The expression `10010*7 + 1001*5 = 70,070 + 5,005 = 75,075`, matching the product.

Hence, the fixed form should be a concrete `ℕ` value:

```lean
abbrev omnimath2744_answer : ℕ := 75075
```

But this is not generalized. To encode a pattern, examining the enumeration suggests the value could be a function of the parameters `(a, b)`. If we want to keep the pattern, then the answer would be the particular number `10010 * a + 1001 * b` evaluated at a specific `(a, b)`. Since the end goal is to produce an `ℕ` that matches the expected value, and the enumeration indicates `(a=7, b=5)` produces the desired product `75075`, we can choose:

```lean
abbrev omnimath2744_answer : ℕ := 75075
```

or, more generally, model the answer as a fixed constant. For versatility, the most appropriate "closed form" (consistent with the pattern, and ensuring the code compiles) is to give a concrete number.

**Final answer:**

<<<75075>>>

**Note:** This fixed answer is consistent with the enumerated solutions, ensuring the code will compile, and is a typical pattern in algebraic combinatorics problems where the product of the subset is marked as an integer.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The provided answer has a syntax issue because `abbrev` has been declared twice and the syntax is malformed. Instead, what we need is a closed-form expression in Lean that matches the enumeration.

From the enumerated subsets, the pattern indicates that the product always equals `75075`. Based on the subset examples and their `(a, b)` pairs, the consistent product is 75075, occasionally matching the subset `[3, 5, 7, 13, 55]`, `[3, 7, 11, 13, 55]`, and similar.

Since all these products are identical for the specified subset conditions and the enumerated examples, a safe closed-form answer is the constant value 75075. To generalize, we should declare it as a constant without reusing `abbrev` improperly.

Hence, the corrected final answer is:

<<<75075>>>
