This problem involves finding all positive integer pairs (a, b) such that a^2 + b^2 = 50. 

Since a and b are positive integers, their squares must be less than or equal to 50. The possible squares are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49. Let's enumerate pairs where a and b are positive, and verify the sum.

We'll list all (a, b) with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 7 (since 7^2=49), check the sum, and output each solution immediately for easy conjecturing.

```python
# Enumerate all positive integers a, b where a^2 + b^2 = 50
# a, b > 0
# Since a^2, b^2 <= 50, max a, b is 7 (because 8^2=64>50)

for a in range(1, 8):
    for b in range(1, 8):
        if a*a + b*b == 50:
            print((a, b))
```
