theorem omnimath3954 (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
  (∃ M, ∀ x, f x < M) ∧ 
  (∀ x y, f (x * f y) + y * f x = x * f y + f (x * y)) ↔ 
  f = omnimath3954_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: f(x) = 0
f(x) = 0 * x + 0
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
<<<fun x : ℝ => 0>>>

The function must satisfy the functional equation and boundedness. The only bounded solution fitting the equation is the zero function.
