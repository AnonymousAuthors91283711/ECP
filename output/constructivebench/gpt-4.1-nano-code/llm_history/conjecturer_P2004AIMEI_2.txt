theorem P2004AIMEI_2 (m : ℤ) (hm : 0 < m) :
  (∃ (a : ℤ), (∑ k in Finset.range m.toNat, (a + k)) = 2 * m) ∧
  (∃ (b : ℤ), (∑ k in Finset.range (2 * m).toNat, (b + k)) = m) ∧
  |(a + m - 1) - (b + 2 * m - 1)| = 99 ↔ m = P2004AIMEI_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No solutions found within the enumeration limit.. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
Given the structure of the sums and the relations, the key is to satisfy the equations simultaneously with the absolute difference equal to 99. Recognizing the sums as arithmetic series, we find that solutions exist only when m = 66, since the difference between sums relates linearly to m. Therefore, the explicit constant solution for m is 66. 

<<<66>>>
