The problem involves counting permutations of 6 elements with exactly 1 fixed point (derangements with one fixed point), dividing by total permutations, and obtaining a rational number. To find the exact value, we'll enumerate permutations with exactly one fixed point over small samples. Since the total number of permutations of 6 elements is 6! = 720, and the permutations with exactly one fixed point can be computed combinatorially but here we're simulating the enumeration.

Let's write the program to generate all permutations of size 6, filter those with exactly one fixed point, compute the ratio to total permutations, and print the result. We will avoid using `Mathlib` and focus purely on standard Python to enumerate permutations.

```python
from itertools import permutations, combinations

# Total permutations of 6 elements
total_permutations = 720  # 6!

fixed_point_permutations = []

elements = list(range(6))
count_with_one_fixed_point = 0

# Generate all permutations
for p in permutations(elements):
    fixed_points = sum(1 for i, x in enumerate(p) if i == x)
    if fixed_points == 1:
        count_with_one_fixed_point += 1
        # Print each such permutation for partial results
        print(f"Permutation with exactly one fixed point: {p}")

ratio = count_with_one_fixed_point / total_permutations
print(f"Count with exactly one fixed point: {count_with_one_fixed_point}")
print(f"Total permutations: {total_permutations}")
print(f"Ratio: {ratio}")
```
