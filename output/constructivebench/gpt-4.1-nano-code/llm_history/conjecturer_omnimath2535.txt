  ∃ (s : Finset ℝ), (∀ x ∈ s, (x^2 + 2 * x + 3) ^ (x^2 + 2 * x + 3) ^ (x^2 + 2 * x + 3) = 2012) ∧ 
  (∀ x, (x^2 + 2 * x + 3) ^ (x^2 + 2 * x + 3) ^ (x^2 + 2 * x + 3) = 2012 → x ∈ s) ∧ 
  ∑ x in s, x = omnimath2535_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solutions: set()
Sum of solutions: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The solutions satisfy (x^2 + 2x + 3) ^ (x^2 + 2x + 3) ^ (x^2 + 2x + 3) = 2012. Observing the pattern, the only real solution occurs when x^2 + 2x + 3 = 1, leading to x = -1. The sum of solutions is then just -1. Final answer in Lean:

<<<-1>>>
