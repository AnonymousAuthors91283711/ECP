In this problem, we're asked to find the least natural number \( n \geq 5 \) such that there's a set of \( n \) pairs \((a_i, b_i)\) with each \(a_i, b_i \in \{1,2,3,4\}\), and that these pairs form a certain combinatorial structure: for any two pairs, there exists a third pair whose \(a\)- and \(b\)-values satisfy certain additive modulo 4 conditions, ensuring that all pairs are distinct and cover all indices without repetition.

This resembles a problem about constructing a set of pairs in \(\{1,2,3,4\} \times \{1,2,3,4\}\) with specific closure properties. The goal is to find the minimal n where such a configuration exists.

Given the complexity, I'll write an enumerate program that tests all possible configurations with increasing n, starting from 5 upward, checking whether the conditions are satisfied.

Since each pair is from a small finite universe, and the total number of pairs is limited, we can generate all subsets (or potential candidate pairings) efficiently and check the conditions.

**Approach:**

- For each \( n \geq 5 \), generate all injective functions \( pairs : Fin n \to \{(a, b)\ |\ a, b \in \{1,2,3,4\}\} \).
- For each such configuration, check if for any pair \(i, j\), there exists a \(k\) making the modulo conditions hold for both \(a\) and \(b\).
- If the conditions hold for all pairs, print that \(n\).

This method will find the minimum \( n \) that satisfies the properties.

```python
from itertools import combinations, permutations, product

# Small universe of pairs
values = range(1, 5)

def check_condition(pairs_list):
    n = len(pairs_list)
    # For each pair (i, j), check existence of k with the modulo conditions
    for i, j in combinations(range(n), 2):
        a_i, b_i = pairs_list[i]
        a_j, b_j = pairs_list[j]
        found = False
        for k in range(n):
            a_k, b_k = pairs_list[k]
            # Check the modulo conditions
            if ((a_i + a_j - a_k) % 4 == 0) and ((b_i + b_j - b_k) % 4 == 0):
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            return False
    return True

# Search for the minimal n starting from 5
min_n_found = None
for n in range(5, 15):  # limit upper bound for practical runtime
    # Generate all injective mappings from {0, ..., n-1} to pairs
    # Since repeats are not allowed for pairs
    all_pairs = list(product(values, repeat=2))
    for candidate in combinations(all_pairs, n):
        # Check if all pairs are distinct explicitly (combinations ensure this)
        pairs_list = list(candidate)
        # Check the conditions
        if check_condition(pairs_list):
            print(f"Found such configuration at n = {n}")
            print("Pairs set:", pairs_list)
            min_n_found = n
            break
    if min_n_found is not None:
        break
if min_n_found is not None:
    print(f"The minimal n where the structure exists is {min_n_found}")
else:
    print("No such configuration found up to n=14")
```
