This problem involves complex roots of unity and quadratic roots, aiming to find the number of complex numbers that are both roots of unity and satisfy some quadratic equation. It appears the core task is to analyze roots of unity that are quadratic roots, characterized by  \[z^2 + a z + b = 0\] with integer coefficients \(a, b\). To enumerate possible answers, I'll select small root of unity orders and small integer coefficients to test, focusing on primitive roots of unity of small order, then check if they satisfy quadratic equations with small integer coefficients.

I'll:

- Consider small-order roots of unity (e.g., orders 1 to 6).

- For each, compute roots, then check if they fulfill a quadratic with small integer coefficients \(a, b \in \{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\}\).

- Count all such roots.

- Output each root as soon as identified.

Here's the implementation:

```python
import cmath

# Enumerate small roots of unity and quadratic equations with small integer coefficients
answers = set()

for n in range(1, 7):  # Small orders of roots of unity
    z = cmath.exp(2j * cmath.pi / n)  # primitive nth root of unity
    roots = [1] if n == 1 else [cmath.exp(2j * cmath.pi * k / n) for k in range(n)]
    for root in roots:
        # Check quadratic equations with small integer coefficients
        for a in range(-2, 3):
            for b in range(-2, 3):
                # If root satisfies z^2 + a z + b = 0
                if abs(root**2 + a * root + b) < 1e-8:
                    # Record the root (rounded for uniqueness)
                    answer = round(root.real, 8) + round(root.imag,8)*1j
                    if answer not in answers:
                        answers.add(answer)
                        print(f"Root of unity order {n}, quadratic coeffs a={a}, b={b}: {answer}")
```
