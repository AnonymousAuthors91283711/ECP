The problem appears to involve algebraic or ratio relationships with positive rational numbers M, C, and p, where we want to find possible values of (M - p * C)/M under the given conditions. To assist in conjecturing the true answer, I will enumerate possible candidates for p that satisfy the initial equation, and then compute the resulting expression. 

Since the problem suggests M/5 = p * (C/3), or equivalently p = (3/5)(M/C), and p > 0, C > 0, M > 0, I will try small sample values that maintain these positivity constraints, then compute the expression (M - p * C)/M for each candidate p.

I will pick sample M and C values, compute p, verify positivity, and then output the corresponding value of (M - p*C)/M, streaming results immediately.

```python
# Enumerate small positive values for M and C to find candidate p
# Then compute (M - p*C)/M

# Define sample values for M and C
M_values = [1, 2, 3]
C_values = [1, 2, 3]

for M in M_values:
    for C in C_values:
        p = (3/5) * (M / C)
        if p > 0:
            # Compute the target expression
            result = (M - p * C) / M
            print(f"For M={M}, C={C}, p={p:.3f} -> (M - p*C)/M = {result:.3f}")
```
