Ground Truth Answer: fun T => 1/9
Proposed Answer: fun T => (2 : ℚ) / (2 * T)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the ratio of prime-valued cubic expressions to total numbers in the range [1, 2T] when T=9.

2. Ground truth answer is 1/9, which means for T=9 (range 1-18), there should be 2 prime-valued numbers (since 18 × 1/9 = 2).

3. Proposed answer is 2/(2T) = 1/T, which would be 1/9 when T=9, matching the ground truth.

4. However, the proposed answer claims this ratio holds for all T, while the ground truth only specifies it for T=9. The general behavior might differ for other T values.

The answers match for T=9 but the proposed answer makes a more general claim that isn't necessarily true.
