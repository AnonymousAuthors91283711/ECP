The problem involves integrating the square of the ceiling function over the interval from 0 to w, where w > 0, and relating it to a specific value (20 * sqrt 7). The task is to determine the value of ⌈2 * w⌉ given the integral's value.

To approach this computationally, we can observe that the integral of (⌈x⌉)^2 from 0 to w can be split into segments over integer intervals, because the ceiling jumps at integer points. For each integer k, on the interval [k, k+1), ⌈x⌉ = k+1. We sum these over as many full integer segments as needed up to w, plus any partial segment.

We'll:
- Guess a small value of w.
- Calculate the integral piecewise.
- Adjust w to match the target integral value (20 * sqrt 7).
- From the found w, compute ⌈2w⌉.

Here's a program that enumerates candidate w values, refining to find approximate matches to the required integral value, then outputs the corresponding ⌈2w⌉.

```python
import math

# Set target integral value
target = 20 * math.sqrt(7)

# We will scan w from 0 to 10 in small increments
step = 0.01
found_candidates = []

w = 0.0
while w <= 10:
    # Sum integral over each full integer interval
    total = 0.0
    max_k = int(w)
    for k in range(max_k):
        # integrate over [k, k+1): (k+1)^2 * length
        total += (k + 1)**2 * 1.0
    # partial interval [max_k, w]
    if w > max_k:
        total += (max_k + 1)**2 * (w - max_k)
    # Check if close to target
    if abs(total - target) < 0.5:
        print(f"w ≈ {w:.2f}, integral = {total:.4f}")
        # store candidate w
        found_candidates.append(w)
    w += step

# For each candidate w, compute ceil(2w)
for wc in found_candidates:
    ceil_val = math.ceil(2 * wc)
    print(f"For w ≈ {wc:.2f}, ⌈2w⌉ = {ceil_val}")
```
