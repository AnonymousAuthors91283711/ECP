This problem asks to determine the number of functions \( abc : (Fin 3 \to (Fin 10) \times (Fin 10)) \) satisfying certain inequality conditions among their outputs, and express the count as a rational number. The set involves tuples of pairs, with constraints that all three pairs have distinct first and second components among themselves.

To implement an enumeration, I will choose small sample values and systematically iterate over all feasible configurations. I'll focus on the possible values of the triples, count valid arrangements, and then compute the exact rational.

This is a combinatorial counting problem involving permutations with constraints. We can approach it as:

- Count how many ways to assign distinct first components to the three points from the 10 available (since all first components are distinct).
- Count how many ways to assign distinct second components to the three points (also from the 10 available).
- Combine these counts, considering the independence of choices with constraints.

Since order matters, the total count is:

\[
\text{Number of ways} = \binom{10}{3} \times 3! \times \binom{10}{3} \times 3!
\]

because:
- Choose 3 distinct first components from 10: \(\binom{10}{3}\),
- Arrange them in order (since \(abc\) is a function from 3 elements): \(3!\),
- Repeat for the second components: \(\binom{10}{3}\),
- Arrange them: \(3!\).

Total:
\[
\binom{10}{3} \times 3! \times \binom{10}{3} \times 3! = \left(\frac{10 \times 9 \times 8}{3 \times 2 \times 1}\right) \times 6 \times \left(\frac{10 \times 9 \times 8}{3 \times 2 \times 1}\right) \times 6
\]

Calculating all options, then dividing by total possible functions (which is \(10^6\), since each of the three outputs is from \(\{0,...,9\} \times \{0,...,9\}\)) would give the probability rational.

Let's implement this exact count.

```python
from math import comb, factorial

# Number of ways to select and arrange 3 distinct first components:
first_choices = comb(10, 3) * factorial(3)

# Number of ways to select and arrange 3 distinct second components:
second_choices = comb(10, 3) * factorial(3)

# Total valid configurations:
total_valid = first_choices * second_choices

# Total possible functions (each of the 3 points independently chooses from 100 options):
total_functions = 100**3

# The result as a rational number:
# To get the exact rational, we perform the division with fractions
from fractions import Fraction
answer_fraction = Fraction(total_valid, total_functions)

# Print the exact rational answer
print(answer_fraction)
```
