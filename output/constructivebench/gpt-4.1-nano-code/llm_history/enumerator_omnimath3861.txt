[write_program]
This appears to be a formal math statement, possibly from a proof assistant like Lean, involving functions from natural numbers to natural numbers, and a property relating to divisibility. The goal is to find all functions \( f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) satisfying a certain divisibility condition for all positive \( a, b \) with \( a + b > 2019 \).

Since the task is to generate candidate functions to help conjecture and potentially prove the statement, and no concrete function is given, a reasonable approach is to enumerate simple functions for small inputs to identify possible patterns. For example, constant functions, linear functions like \( f(n) = kn \), or functions based on common simple formulas.

The code below will:
- Enumerate a small set of candidate functions.
- For each, test the divisibility condition for some small, positive \( a, b \) satisfying \( a + b > 2019 \).
- Print candidates immediately if they satisfy the property in the tested cases, aiding in pattern recognition.

Given the constraints, this code focuses on efficiency, simple candidates, and early streaming results.

```python
# Enumere simple candidate functions f(n)
# For small n, test if the divisibility condition holds for some sample (a,b), b > 0, a > 0, a+b > 2019
# Candidate functions: constant f(n)=k; linear f(n)=k*n for small k; zero function

def is_valid_candidate(f, samples):
    # Test each sample (a,b)
    for a, b in samples:
        if a > 0 and b > 0 and a + b > 2019:
            A = a
            B = b
            numerator = A**2 + B * f(A)
            denominator = A + f(b)
            if denominator == 0:
                return False  # avoid division by zero
            if numerator % denominator != 0:
                return False
    return True

# Generate candidate functions
candidates = []

# Constant functions: f(n)=k for k in 1..5
for k in range(1, 6):
    candidates.append(lambda n, k=k: k)

# Linear functions: f(n)=k*n for small k
for k in range(1, 4):
    candidates.append(lambda n, k=k: k*n)

# Zero function
zero_fn = lambda n: 0

# Sample (a,b) pairs; choose small but ensure a+b>2019 is possible
# Since 2019 is large, try large a or b to test the condition
samples = [(2020, 1), (1010, 1010), (2000, 20), (1500, 520), (2020, 1)]  # some with sum > 2019

# Store answers
answers = []

for f in [zero_fn]:
    if is_valid_candidate(f, samples):
        answers.append(f)
        print(f"Candidate f(n)={f.__name__ if hasattr(f, '__name__') else f} passes tests.")

for k in range(1, 6):
    f = lambda n, k=k: k
    if is_valid_candidate(f, samples):
        print(f"Constant function f(n)={k} passes tests.")

for k in range(1, 4):
    f = lambda n, k=k: k*n
    if is_valid_candidate(f, samples):
        print(f"Linear function f(n)={k}*n passes tests.")

# These are just candidate patterns; more detailed and exhaustive search can be performed
```
