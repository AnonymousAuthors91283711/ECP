This problem involves finding the least natural number \( n \) such that the sum of the absolute differences \( |k - (\text{round}(\sqrt{k}))^2| \) over \( k \) from 0 to \( n-1 \) equals \( 100 \times n \). 

To solve this, we will:
- Explore the behavior of \( |k - (\text{round}(\sqrt{k}))^2| \),
- Generate values for \( n \), compute the sum, and check when the sum reaches \( 100 \times n \),
- Stop when the sum exceeds or matches the target,
- Output candidate answers specifically where the sum equals exactly \( 100 \times n \),
- Search for the least such \( n \).

This enumeration finds candidate \( n \) values efficiently by approximating the intervals where \( \text{round}(\sqrt{k}) \) stays constant, then sums the differences within these intervals.

```python
import math

def main():
    total = 0
    n = 0
    # We'll search up to a certain limit
    while n < 1000:
        sum_diff = 0
        for k in range(n):
            r = round(math.sqrt(k))
            diff = abs(k - r*r)
            sum_diff += diff
        if sum_diff == 100 * n:
            print(n)
        n += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
