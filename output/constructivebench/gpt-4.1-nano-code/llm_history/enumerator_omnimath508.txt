This problem asks to find the least natural number \(x > 0\) such that \(x^2 + x + 41\) is *not prime*. It's a classic form related to Euler's prime polynomial, which produces primes for many initial values but eventually produces a composite.

To assist in conjecturing and proving this, we will:
- Enumerate values starting from \(x=1\).
- Check whether \(x^2 + x + 41\) is prime.
- When we find the first \(x\) where this expression is composite, we report it as a candidate answer.

Since the problem asks for the least such \(x\), we will stop at the first found composite.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n in (2, 3):
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    r = int(n**0.5)
    for i in range(3, r + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

x = 1
while True:
    value = x*x + x + 41
    if not is_prime(value):
        print(f"x = {x}, value = {value} (composite)")
        break
    x += 1
```
