Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: { (1, -4, -2), (3, 2, 3) }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer provides two specific solutions to the system of equations, but the ground truth answer is expected to be a complete characterization of all solutions (likely as a set description). The proposed answer is correct in that both (1, -4, -2) and (3, 2, 3) satisfy the given equations, but it's incomplete as it doesn't show all possible solutions. For example, (1, 2, 4) is another valid solution that's missing from the proposed answer. Therefore, while the proposed answer contains correct solutions, it's not fully equivalent to the complete solution set.
