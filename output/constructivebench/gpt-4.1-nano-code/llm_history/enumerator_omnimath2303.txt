This problem appears to involve counting certain natural numbers with specific digit properties and ratios involving their subsets. To assist in conjecturing and proving the true answer, I will write a Python script that enumerates all candidate numbers satisfying the criteria (digits at least length 2, distinct digits, evenness), computes the ratio of even numbers to all numbers within the set, and outputs the ratio as an approximation.

Since the problem is abstract and seems to be computationally manageable for small N, I will choose a small upper limit (e.g., 4-digit numbers) for enumeration.

We'll:
- Generate numbers with at least 2 digits, all digits unique.
- Filter those that are even.
- Calculate the ratio of even to total.
- Output the ratio and some sample counts.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers with at least 2 digits and distinct digits
# Count how many are even, and compute the ratio

from itertools import permutations

def main():
    max_digits = 4  # Limit to 4-digit numbers for feasibility
    total_count = 0
    even_count = 0

    for num_digits in range(2, max_digits + 1):
        # Generate all permutations of digits 1-9 for leading digit, 0-9 for others
        digits = '0123456789'
        for perm in permutations(digits, num_digits):
            # Leading digit can't be zero
            if perm[0] == '0':
                continue
            n_str = ''.join(perm)
            n = int(n_str)
            total_count += 1
            if n % 2 == 0:
                even_count += 1
                print(f"Even candidate: {n}")
    if total_count > 0:
        ratio = even_count / total_count
        print(f"Count of total numbers: {total_count}")
        print(f"Count of even numbers: {even_count}")
        print(f"Ratio of even to total: {ratio}")
    else:
        print("No candidates generated.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
