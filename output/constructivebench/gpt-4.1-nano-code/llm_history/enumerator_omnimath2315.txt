The problem involves finding the number of nonempty finite subsets of the set \( \{ (i,j) \mid i \in \text{Fin 3}, j \in \text{Fin 2} \} \). 

The set \( \text{Fin 3} \times \text{Fin 2} \) has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) elements. The task is to count how many nonempty subsets it has.

Number of all subsets: \(2^6 = 64\)

Number of nonempty subsets: \(64 - 1 = 63\)

Therefore, the answer is 63.

```python
# Enumerate the size of the set (Fin 3 x Fin 2), which has 6 elements
set_size = 6
# Total subsets are 2^6
total_subsets = 2 ** set_size
# Subtract 1 for the empty set
nonempty_subsets = total_subsets - 1
# Stream the answer
print(nonempty_subsets)
```
