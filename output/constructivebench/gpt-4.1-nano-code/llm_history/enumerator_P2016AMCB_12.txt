This problem involves finding a 3x3 integer matrix with entries between 1 and 9, where every entry is unique, and certain difference conditions are satisfied. The key constraints include:
- Entries are between 1 and 9.
- All entries are distinct.
- If the absolute difference of two entries is 1, their indices differ by exactly 1 in Manhattan distance.
- The sum of the four corner entries equals 18.
- The middle entry (M 1 1) is to be determined.

Since the problem involves small fixed bounds, we can enumerate all possible matrices satisfying the constraints and check conditions. The main challenge is efficiency; we'll optimize by fixing the center and corners, then constructing possible matrices that satisfy the derivative constraints.

Below is a Python program that performs such enumeration:
- Uses itertools.product to generate candidate matrices.
- Checks all constraints, including entry ranges, distinctness, difference conditions, and sum of corners.
- Prints partial and final candidates immediately.

The code avoids unnecessary computations by filtering early and only enumerating promising configurations.

```python
import itertools

def is_valid_matrix(M):
    # Check all entries between 1 and 9
    if any(entry < 1 or entry > 9 for row in M for entry in row):
        return False
    # Check that all entries are distinct
    if len({entry for row in M for entry in row}) != 9:
        return False
    # Check the sum of corners
    if M[0][0] + M[0][2] + M[2][0] + M[2][2] != 18:
        return False
    # Check the difference condition: if abs difference is 1, indices differ by Manhattan distance 1
    for i1 in range(3):
        for j1 in range(3):
            for i2 in range(3):
                for j2 in range(3):
                    if (i1, j1) != (i2, j2):
                        diff = abs(M[i1][j1] - M[i2][j2])
                        if diff == 1:
                            # Manhattan distance
                            if abs(i1 - i2) + abs(j1 - j2) != 1:
                                return False
    return True
