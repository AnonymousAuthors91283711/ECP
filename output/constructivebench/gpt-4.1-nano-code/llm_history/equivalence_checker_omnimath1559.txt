Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {x : ℤ | x = 0 ∨ x = 2 ∨ x = 8}
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in Lean), we cannot verify whether the proposed answer {x : ℤ | x = 0 ∨ x = 2 ∨ x = 8} is equivalent to it. The problem appears to be about finding all integer solutions c that satisfy the given system of equations, but without knowing the intended solution, we cannot determine equivalence.
