This problem involves analyzing a function \(f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) defined as \(f(x) = \begin{cases}0 & x<1 \\ 2x - 2 & x \ge 1\end{cases}\) and finding the size of the set of points \(x\) such that applying \(f\) four times yields \(x\), i.e., \(f^4(x) = x\). To assist in conjecturing and verifying, we'll enumerate possible solutions by iterating over relevant domain segments, seeking fixed points or cycles, and considering the behavior in different regions.

Since the problem is high-school difficulty, we focus on plausible candidates, such as points in the fixed points, 2-cycles, and potential 4-cycles, by iterating over the regions \(x<1\) and \(x \ge 1\), with sample values, and applying \(f\) repeatedly.

The code will:
- Enumerate candidate values in regions \(x<1\) and \(x \ge 1\).
- Compute \(f^4(x)\) for each candidate.
- Check if \(f^4(x) = x\).
- Print solutions as they are discovered.
- Use small ranges for efficiency.
- Maximize effectiveness while respecting token limits.

```python
# Enumerate potential solutions for f^4(x)=x using sample points around fixed points and cycles.

def f(x):
    return 0 if x < 1 else 2 * x - 2

def iterate_f(x, n=4):
    for _ in range(n):
        x = f(x)
    return x

# Sample candidate points around key regions:
candidates = []
# Fixed point candidate in x<1:
for x in [0, 0.5, 0.99]:
    candidates.append(x)
# In x>=1:
for x in [1, 1.5, 2]:
    candidates.append(x)

# Also test boundary:
candidates += [0.999, 1.001]

for x in candidates:
    x4 = iterate_f(x, 4)
    if abs(x4 - x) < 1e-8:
        print(f"Solution candidate: x={x:.3f} with f^4(x)={x4:.3f}")
```
