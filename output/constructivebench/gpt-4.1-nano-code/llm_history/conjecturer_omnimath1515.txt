Because no solutions exist with small m, n, the minimal sum m + n is likely when m, n are as close as possible and satisfy the constraints. Testing minimal n > 1, the smallest n that satisfies the conditions is n = 2; with minimal m > n, we get m=3. Calculations with x_j's suggest the sum m + n=5. No solutions for smaller sums imply the minimal answer is 5.
