The pattern suggests the answer set contains specific composite numbers where divisor conditions hold for the function \(f(k) = k^2 + k + 1\). The pattern appears to select certain primes and composites with particular properties, notably derived from numbers like 4, 7, 13, 19, 25, etc. Since the sequence is irregular but somewhat complete within the set of numbers where \(f(k)|f(n)\) holds, the natural closed-form capturing the set is the set of such numbers fitting the pattern with this divisor property.

Given the hints and pattern, the set includes numbers of the form \(4k + 1\) or similar, but because the enumerated elements are specific, a comprehensive closed-form implies numbers satisfying certain divisibility constraints related to \(f\).

Based on the enumeration, the set includes numbers that are either 1 or odd and prime, with specific exclusions, and composite number \(4\). The simplest closed formula matching the enumeration is a union of singleton and specific composite numbers, which approximate the pattern observed.
