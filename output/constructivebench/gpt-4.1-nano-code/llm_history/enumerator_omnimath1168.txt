The problem appears to define a recursive function over natural numbers n ≥ 2, with a base case at n=2, and an increasing recurrence for n+3. The function involves a sum with halving of previous recursive results. The goal is to find the exact rational value of `f ⟨2002, _⟩`. Given the pattern, we suspect the values may form a sequence expressible in closed form or at least a pattern that can be enumerated for small n, to help conjecture the result.

Since directly evaluating at n=2002 might be complex, we will:
- Compute initial values for small n, especially at the base case and the first few recursions,
- Observe the pattern,
- Verify if it stabilizes or follows a recognizable pattern.

Here is a Python code that:
- Mimics the recursive sequence for small n,
- Computes and prints the approximate or exact value for the sequence starting from n=2, increasing by 3 each time up to near 2002,
- Uses rational arithmetic for exactness.

The code avoids unnecessary calculations beyond a certain index, focusing on the initial pattern to aid in the conjecture.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Recursive function mimicking the mathematical definition
def f(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n == 2:
        memo[n] = Fraction(2,1)  # base case
        return memo[n]
    elif n >= 5:
        prev = f(n - 1 - 2)  # adjust to recursive pattern
        # Recurse back three steps and add the halved value
        result = (n) + Fraction(1, 2) * f(n - 1)
        memo[n] = result
        return result
    else:
        # For n < 5, manually compute or raise
        # Since pattern is for n ≥ 2, and recursion involves n+3, focus on n ≥ 2
        # But for simplicity, stop recursion here
        return Fraction(0, 1)

# Generate sequence for n starting at 2, increasing by 3 up to at least 2002
start_n = 2
end_n = 2002
step = 3

current_n = start_n
results = []

# Generate and print initial sequence values for analysis
while current_n <= end_n:
    val = f(current_n)
    print(f"f({current_n}) = {val}")
    results.append((current_n, val))
    current_n += step
```
