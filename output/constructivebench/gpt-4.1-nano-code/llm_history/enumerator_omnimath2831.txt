This problem appears to involve solving a rational equation involving integer parameters. The key steps are to find all integer solutions \(b\) satisfying \((3 + b)/(3 - b) = -4\). To help uncover solutions, I'll implement a Python program that enumerates integer \(b\) values, checks the equation, and reports solutions, avoiding hardcoding or assumptions.

The enumeration will test small integers around the potential solution, and due to the constraint \(3 \neq b\) (to avoid division by zero), it will exclude \(b=3\).

The approach: For each candidate \(b\), compute the left side. If it equals \(-4\), print that \(b\). Additionally, the program finds the exact rational solutions, approximates where needed, and remains efficient. 

Since the user asks for no input arguments and the full enumeration, the code will run directly:

```python
# Enumerate integer values of b to solve (3 + b)/(3 - b) = -4
# Avoid division by zero at b=3, check solutions, and print all solutions found

for b in range(-20, 21):  # small range for demonstration
    if b == 3:
        continue  # avoid division by zero
    numerator = 3 + b
    denominator = 3 - b
    # Check if the fraction equals -4
    if denominator != 0 and numerator * 1 == -4 * denominator:
        print(f"b = {b} is a solution")
```

This code searches integers b in a small range, which suffices for typical high school problems, reports solutions, and can easily be expanded if needed.
