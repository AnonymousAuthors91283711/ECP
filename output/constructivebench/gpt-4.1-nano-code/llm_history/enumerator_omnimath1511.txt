The problem is about a set \( S \) of natural numbers \( x \) for which there exist positive integers \( a, b, c \) with distinct values, constrained by \( P \), such that \( a + b + c = x \). The predicate \( P \) involves a complex condition including a square root of an expression involving \( a, b, c \).

Since the core challenge is to find the smallest such \( x \), the computational approach is:
- Generate candidate triples \((a, b, c)\) with small positive values and distinctness.
- Check if they satisfy the condition in \( P \). This involves calculating the sqrt expression.
- For those that satisfy \( P \), record the sum \( a + b + c \).
- Find the minimal such sum, i.e., the least element in \( S \).

In the code, we'll:
- Set small bounds for \( a, b, c \) (say up to 20) for efficiency.
- Check all distinct triples.
- Compute whether the sqrt condition holds (approximations are involved).
- Stream answers as we find minimal sums, updating the minimum as necessary.

```python
# Generate all distinct triples (a, b, c) with small bounds
# Check the condition involving the square root
# Track the minimal sum and output candidates immediately

import math

def is_valid(a, b, c):
    # Compute the expression for the square root
    # k = sqrt(a * sqrt(b * sqrt(c)))
    inner = b * math.sqrt(c)
    if inner < 0:
        return False
    sqrt_inner = math.sqrt(inner)
    val = a * sqrt_inner
    if val < 0:
        return False
    k = math.sqrt(val)
    # Check if k is close to an integer
    return abs(k - round(k)) < 1e-6

min_sum = None
answers = []

# Choose bounds for a, b, c
BOUND = 20

for a in range(1, BOUND + 1):
    for b in range(1, BOUND + 1):
        if b == a:
            continue
        for c in range(1, BOUND + 1):
            if c == a or c == b:
                continue
            if is_valid(a, b, c):
                sum_abc = a + b + c
                if min_sum is None or sum_abc < min_sum:
                    min_sum = sum_abc
                print(f"Found candidate: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, sum={sum_abc}")
                answers.append(sum_abc)

# Output the minimal sum, i.e., the least element in S
print(f"Minimum sum in S: {min_sum}")
```
