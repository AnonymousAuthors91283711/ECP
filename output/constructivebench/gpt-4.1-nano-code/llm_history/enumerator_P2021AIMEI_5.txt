This problem involves searching for integer triplets \((a, b, c)\) within \([-100, 100]\) satisfying multiple conditions:
- \(a < b < c\),
- \(b - a = c - b\) (arithmetic progression),
- \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = b \times (b - a)^2\),
- and all are within bounds.

Given these, we suspect the sequence is an arithmetic progression with difference \(d = b - a = c - b\). Substituting \(b = a + d\), \(c = a + 2d\), the key equation becomes:

\[
a^2 + (a + d)^2 + (a + 2d)^2 = (a + d) d^2
\]

We can analyze this parametrically for \(a, d\) within manageable ranges, then check solutions.

The program will iterate over small \(a, d\) in the range \([-50, 50]\) for efficiency. For each candidate, it computes \(b, c\), verifies bounds, and satisfies the key equation. When a solution is found, it is printed immediately. This supports conjecturing and can be extended further if needed.

```python
# Enumerate small integer sequences with arithmetic progression satisfying the given equation
for a in range(-50, 51):
    for d in range(-50, 51):
        b = a + d
        c = a + 2 * d
        if not (-100 <= a <= 100 and -100 <= b <= 100 and -100 <= c <= 100):
            continue
        lhs = a**2 + b**2 + c**2
        rhs = b * (d**2)
        if lhs == rhs:
            print((a, b, c))
```
