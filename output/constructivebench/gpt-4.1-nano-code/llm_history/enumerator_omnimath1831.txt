The problem involves finding complex numbers \(a, b, c\) satisfying a symmetric system:
\[
a^2 = b - c,\quad b^2 = c - a,\quad c^2 = a - b,
\]
and then examining the sum \(a + b + c\). The goal is to find all possible sums \(a + b + c\) that fit this system.

Given the symmetry, a natural approach is:

- Explore solutions where some of the variables are equal.
- Check the case \(a = b = c\).
- If that fails, analyze the symmetric conditions to find possible values for the sum.

Because the solution involves potentially multiple solutions, we'll implement an enumeration approach over small complex values, considering that the problem is likely polynomial in nature (quadratic equations). We will:

- Generate candidate triples \((a, b, c)\) with small integer or rational parts.
- Check the system for each candidates.
- For valid solutions, print out the sum \(a + b + c\).

We'll limit enumeration to small values because the full solution space is infinite, but small candidates can reveal possible sums.

```python
# Enumerate small complex numbers with integer parts from -5 to 5, then check the system
# and print all sums a + b + c for solutions satisfying the equations.

def check_solution(a, b, c):
    # Check if the equations hold within a small numerical tolerance
    tol = 1e-8
    eq1 = abs(a**2 - (b - c)) < tol
    eq2 = abs(b**2 - (c - a)) < tol
    eq3 = abs(c**2 - (a - b)) < tol
    return eq1 and eq2 and eq3

                for c_real in range(-5, 6):
                    for c_im in range(-5, 6):
                        c = complex(c_real, c_im)
                        if check_solution(a, b, c):
                            s = a + b + c
                            # Save as tuple of real and imaginary parts
                            results.add((round(s.real, 6), round(s.imag, 6)))
                            print(f"Solution sum: {s.real}+{s.imag}*i")
# This brute-force approach should reveal potential solution sums for small candidates.
