This problem appears to involve counting functions from a finite domain (size 36) to a finite codomain (size 10), with a particular property related to the sum of the function values modulo 10 and the image of the function. 

We want to enumerate all functions s : Fin 36 â†’ Fin 10, check the condition involving the sum modulo 10 and the range of s, and count how many satisfy it. Since enumerating all such functions exactly is huge (10^36 possible functions), an explicit brute force is impractical for direct enumeration. Instead, we look for combinatorial properties or smaller subproblems, employing simplified parameters or heuristic reasoning.

For this code, I will consider all possible sums modulo 10 (from 0 to 9), and examine sequences consistent with the conditions, to generate a conjecture on how many such functions exist, then orient towards the exact count.

The main idea:
- For each total sum mod 10, count assignments where sum mod 10 is not in the function's range.
- Since we want an exact enumeration, we'll use a dynamic programming approach for small parameters or sample cases, and print the counts.

Note: For a full enumeration over 10^36 functions, it's infeasible, so we demonstrate with smaller subproblems or combinatorial inspections. 

Below is the Python code to approximate or simulate this enumeration for a smaller sample, illustrating the process. The full exact answer would require heavy optimization or mathematical insight, but this code will list the approach and potential counts.

```python
# Enumerate functions from a small domain and count how many satisfy a similar property
from itertools import product

def count_satisfying_functions(domain_size=5, codomain_size=3):
    # For demonstration, reduce complexity: domain_size=5, codomain_size=3
    total_functions = 0
    satisfying_functions = 0
    
    # Generate all functions as mappings from positions to codomain values
    for s in product(range(codomain_size), repeat=domain_size):
        total_sum = sum(s)
        sum_mod_10 = total_sum % 10
        # Range of s is the set of assigned values
        s_range = set(s)
        # Condition: sum_mod_10 not in range of s
        if sum_mod_10 not in s_range:
            satisfying_functions += 1
            print(f"Function: {s}, sum: {total_sum}, sum_mod_10: {sum_mod_10}, range: {s_range}")
        total_functions += 1
    print(f"Total functions checked: {total_functions}")
    print(f"Satisfying functions count: {satisfying_functions}")
    return satisfying_functions

# Execute the scaled-down enumeration
count_satisfying_functions()
```
