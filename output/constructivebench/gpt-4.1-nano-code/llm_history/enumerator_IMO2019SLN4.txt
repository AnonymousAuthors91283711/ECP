This problem appears to involve number theory and functions satisfying certain divisibility conditions. Given the structure and named reference (IMO2019SLN4), it likely relates to a classic problem involving functions \(f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) with divisibility properties involving sums and products, parameterized by \(C\).

To assist with conjecturing the solution, I will:  
- Set small parameter values for \(C\); for example, \(C=1\).  
- Enumerate potential functions \(f(n)\), considering simple forms like constant functions, linear functions, or indicator functions.  
- Check the divisibility condition for small \(a, b\).

The code will generate candidate functions \(f\) for small inputs and verify divisibility conditions under the assumption \(a + b > C\). It will print candidate functions that satisfy the conditions or explain why they do not.

```python
# Enumerate possible functions f : N -> N with simple forms for small C.
# For the purpose of this enumeration, we consider constant functions and simple linear functions.
# We verify the divisibility condition for small a, b under the assumption a + b > C.
# We print each function if it satisfies the conditions for the tested pairs.

def check_divisibility(f, C, max_a_b=5):
    # Check the divisibility condition for small a, b with a + b > C
    for a in range(1, max_a_b + 1):
        for b in range(1, max_a_b + 1):
            if a + b > C:
                numerator = a**2 + b * f(a)
                denominator = a + f(b)
                if denominator == 0:
                    return False
                if numerator % denominator != 0:
                    return False
    return True

# We test constant functions: f(n) = k
for k in range(1, 4):
    def f(n, k=k):
        return k
    if check_divisibility(f, C=1):
        print(f"Constant function f(n) = {k} satisfies the condition for C=1.")

# We test linear functions: f(n) = m * n + c
for m in range(0, 3):
    for c in range(0, 3):
        def f(n, m=m, c=c):
            return m * n + c
        if check_divisibility(f, C=1):
            print(f"Linear function f(n) = {m}*n + {c} satisfies the condition for C=1.")

# Since exhaustive enumeration isn't possible for large spaces, focus on simple functions.
# The goal is to generate candidate functions that can be used for conjecture.
