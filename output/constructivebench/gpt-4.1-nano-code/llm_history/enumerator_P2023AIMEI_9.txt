The problem involves enumerating specific cubic polynomials with integer coefficients within certain bounds, and then determining how many such polynomials satisfy a unique evaluation property (evaluating to the same value at an undetermined point m, different from 2). To efficiently tackle this, we'll:
- Fix small parameter ranges for coefficients a, b, c.
- Generate all such cubic polynomials.
- For each polynomial, check for a unique m â‰  2 such that eval m p = eval 2 p.
- Count those polynomials satisfying the condition.

Below is a Python script that performs this enumeration:

```python
# Enumerate all cubic polynomials p(x) = x^3 + a*x^2 + b*x + c
# with a, b, c in [-20, 20]
# For each p, check if there exists a unique m != 2 with p(m) = p(2)
# Count how many such polynomials satisfy the condition

coeff_range = range(-20, 21)
target_x = 2
results = set()

for a in coeff_range:
    for b in coeff_range:
        for c in coeff_range:
            def p(x):
                return x**3 + a * x**2 + b * x + c
            p_at_2 = p(target_x)
            count_m = 0
            # Search for m in small range approx [-20,20] (can be expanded)
            for m in range(-20, 21):
                if m != target_x and p(m) == p_at_2:
                    count_m += 1
            if count_m == 1:
                results.add((a, b, c))

print(f"Number of polynomials: {len(results)}")
for poly in results:
    a, b, c = poly
    print(f"p(x) = x^3 + ({a})x^2 + ({b})x + ({c})")
```
