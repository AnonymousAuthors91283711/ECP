abbrev omnimath3679_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3679 (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
  (∀ x y z, x + y + z = 0 → f (x^3) + f y ^ 3 + f z ^ 3 = 3 * x * y * z) ↔ f = omnimath3679_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing linear functions of form f(t) = a t
f(t) = -1 * t satisfies the functional equation on chosen triples.
f(t) = 0 * t satisfies the functional equation on chosen triples.
f(t) = 1 * t satisfies the functional equation on chosen triples.
Testing quadratic functions of form f(t) = c * t^2
f(t) = 0 * t^2 satisfies the functional equation on chosen triples.
Testing constant functions f(t) = k
f(t) = 0 is a solution.
Check f(t)=t at (x,y,z)=(1,0,-1): lhs=0, rhs=0
The zero function f(t)=0 is always a solution.
