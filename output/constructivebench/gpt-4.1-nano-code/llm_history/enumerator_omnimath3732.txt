The problem involves finding all triples \((a, b, c) âˆˆ \mathbb{R}^3\) satisfying the symmetric system:
\[
a^2 + a b + c = 0,\quad b^2 + b c + a = 0,\quad c^2 + c a + b = 0.
\]

Since the system is symmetric in \(a, b, c\), candidates might include scenarios where some variables are equal or zero. To understand the solutions, I will:

1. Check the case when all variables are equal: \(a = b = c\).
2. Check the case when some variables are zeroes.
3. Enumerate small integer or rational values to detect other potential solutions.

I'll implement a program that:
- Checks the all-equal case \(a = b = c\),
- Checks zero combinations,
- Enumerates small rational and integer triples to discover solutions, printing each as soon as found.

Given the symmetry and polynomial nature, solutions tend to be rational or algebraic numbers that can be approximated. My approach:
- Use rational testing for small integers in \([-10, 10]\) ranges,
- Check the symmetry to avoid duplicate solutions.

Here's the Python code:

```python
# Enumerate solutions (a, b, c) with small integers in range [-10, 10]
# for the given symmetric system.

solution_set = set()

# Check for the all-equal case: a = b = c
for a in range(-10, 11):
    c = a
    b = a
    # Verify the equations
    eq1 = a**2 + a*b + c
    eq2 = b**2 + b*c + a
    eq3 = c**2 + c*a + b
    if eq1 == 0 and eq2 == 0 and eq3 == 0:
        triplet = (a, b, c)
        if triplet not in solution_set:
            print(triplet)
            solution_set.add(triplet)

# Check for solutions where one variable is zero
for a in range(-10, 11):
    for b in range(-10, 11):
        for c in range(-10, 11):
            # Skip already checked equal case
            if a == b == c:
                continue
            eq1 = a**2 + a*b + c
            eq2 = b**2 + b*c + a
            eq3 = c**2 + c*a + b
            if eq1 == 0 and eq2 == 0 and eq3 == 0:
                triplet = (a, b, c)
                if triplet not in solution_set:
                    print(triplet)
                    solution_set.add(triplet)

# Additionally, check for solutions with small rational approximations (not included here
# due to integer range, but can be extended if needed).

# Note: For exact solutions, algebraic methods or symbolic solvers would be ideal.
```

This code searches via brute-force enumeration for small integer solutions, immediately printing each found solution. It prioritizes exact solutions within the limited search range, aligning with the problem's streaming output and efficiency demands.
