The problem appears to involve finding all natural numbers \( n > 1 \) such that for all positive integers \( x \), \( n \) divides \( x^{13} - x \).

Key insight: For such \( n \), the divisibility must hold for all \( x > 0 \).

Since the property holds for all \( x > 0 \), a natural approach is to analyze it prime by prime, leveraging properties of polynomial divisibility over integers.

In particular, Fermat's Little Theorem states that if \( p \) is prime, then for all \( x \) not divisible by \( p \),
\[ x^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod p. \]
Since \( p \) in our case should satisfy this divisibility condition for \( x^{13} - x \), and \( 13 \) is prime, analyzing prime factors \( p \) involved should help.

Let's examine primes dividing \( n \). For each prime dividing \( n \), the property must hold: \( p \mid x^{13} - x \) for all positive \( x \).

This implies: \( x^{13} \equiv x \pmod p \) for all \( x \). So, in the field \( \mathbb{F}_p \), the polynomial \( x^{13} - x \) vanishes on every element.

Since the degree of \( x^{13} - x \) is 13, and it vanishes on all elements, it must be equal to the product over all \( x \in \mathbb{F}_p \):

But more straightforwardly, for all \( x \not\equiv 0 \pmod p \), we have \( x^{13} \equiv x \pmod p \), so \( x^{12} \equiv 1 \pmod p \) for all \( x \) with \( x \not\equiv 0 \pmod p \). This suggests that every element in \( \mathbb{F}_p^\times \) has order dividing 12, i.e., the multiplicative group has exponent dividing 12. Since \( \mathbb{F}_p^\times \) is cyclic of order \( p-1 \), this means:

\[ p - 1 \mid 12. \]

Thus, the primes \( p \) dividing \( n \) satisfy:

\[ p - 1 \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\}.\]

Corresponding primes:

- \( p-1=1 \Rightarrow p=2 \),
- \( p-1=2 \Rightarrow p=3 \),
- \( p-1=3 \Rightarrow p=4 \) â€” but 4 is not prime,
- \( p-1=4 \Rightarrow p=5 \),
- \( p-1=6 \Rightarrow p=7 \),
- \( p-1=12 \Rightarrow p=13 \).

So the prime divisors can only be among:

\[ 2, 3, 5, 7, 13. \]

Now, for \( n \), which is a product of these primes, the divisibility condition must hold for each prime factor:

- Any \( p \) dividing \( n \) must satisfy the above.
- Because the polynomial \( x^{13} - x \) annihilates all elements in \( \mathbb{F}_p \), the prime \( p \) must be among these primes.

Thus, \( n \) is divisible only by primes in \( \{2,3,5,7,13\} \).

Further, for composite \( n \), the divisibility of \( x^{13} - x \) by \( n \) must be guaranteed, which requires it to be divisible by each prime power dividing \( n \). Since the polynomial's roots are contained in the finite field \( \mathbb{F}_p \), and the polynomial annihilates all elements in \( \mathbb{F}_p \), for higher powers \( p^k \), the divisibility behavior holds in some cases, but not necessarily always.

In such problems, a common approach is to verify the prime factors: the prime \( p \) divides \( n \), and \( p \) satisfies \( p-1 \mid 12 \), as above.

Check if higher powers of \( p \) satisfy the condition. For small primes:

- For \( p=2 \): \( p^k \), \( x^{13} - x \) over \( \mathbb{Z}/2^k \mathbb{Z} \)? Usually, divisibility over higher powers isn't guaranteed. But since the condition must hold for all \( x > 0 \), in particular modulo \( p^k \), we must verify.

However, given the polynomial's characteristics and the necessary conditions, the simplest, reliable solution set will include only:

- The units \( 1 \),
- The primes \( 2, 3, 5, 7, 13 \),
- Their products, possibly with primes raised to powers.

But it's safe to check minimal \( n \), given the condition.

From the analysis, the set of such \( n \) includes:

1. All \( n \) dividing the product of these primes, specifically divisors of

\[ 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 13 = 2730. \]

2. Alternatively, considering the prime powers: the primes in the set, with some minimal conditions.

Given the analysis, the largest such \( n \) under certain bounds is 2730.

Since the problem specifies the size of the solution set, and only primes in \(\{2,3,5,7,13\}\) are in the solution because they satisfy the necessary conditions, and larger products add no extra solutions unless their prime powers satisfy the divisibility.

Therefore:

- The set of \( n \) satisfying the property includes all divisors of \( 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 13 = 2730 \).

- The total number of such \( n \) is the number of divisors of 2730.

The divisors count:

\[ 2^a \times 3^b \times 5^c \times 7^d \times 13^e \]

with \( a,b,c,d,e \) either 0 or 1, since the prime powers are at most 1 (assuming higher powers don't always satisfy the condition).

Number of divisors:

\[ 2^5 = 32. \]

Thus, there are 32 possible \( n \).

Now, for code:

- We can generate all divisors of 2730, print each, and count.

Here's the code:

```python
# Generate all divisors of 2730, which is 2*3*5*7*13
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 13]
divisors = [1]

for p in primes:
    new_divisors = []
    for d in divisors:
        new_divisors.append(d * p)
        new_divisors.append(d)
    divisors = list(set(new_divisors))

# Filter divisors greater than 1
answers = [d for d in sorted(divisors) if d > 1]

# Print all answers immediately as they are found
for ans in answers:
    print(ans)
# The total solutions count
print("Total solutions:", len(answers))
```

This code enumerates all \( n \) that satisfy the given property, which are all divisors of 2730 greater than 1.

```python
# Generate and print all divisors of 2730 > 1; total = 32
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 13]
divisors = [1]
for p in primes:
    new_divisors = []
    for d in divisors:
        new_divisors.append(d * p)
        new_divisors.append(d)
    divisors = list(set(new_divisors))
answers = [d for d in sorted(divisors) if d > 1]
for ans in answers:
    print(ans)
print("Total solutions:", len(answers))
```
