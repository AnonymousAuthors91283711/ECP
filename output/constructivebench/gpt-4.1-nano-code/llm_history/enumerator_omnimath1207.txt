This problem asks to find the number of integers \( n \) between 1 and 420 (inclusive) such that for any distinct \( a, b \in \{5,6,7\} \), \( n \% a \neq n \% b \). Equivalently, for each \( n \), the remainders when divided by 5, 6, and 7 must be all distinct.

I will enumerate all \( n \) in 1..420, check if the remainders are pairwise distinct for \( a, b \in \{5,6,7\} \), and count such \( n \).

```python
# Enumerate n from 1 to 420
# For each n, check if remainders modulo 5,6,7 are pairwise distinct
# Count and print each valid n during the process
count = 0
for n in range(1, 421):
    remainders = [n % 5, n % 6, n % 7]
    if len(set(remainders)) == 3:
        print(n)
        count += 1
print(f"Total count: {count}")
# Adjusted to only print answers, the total count can be used as the answer
```
