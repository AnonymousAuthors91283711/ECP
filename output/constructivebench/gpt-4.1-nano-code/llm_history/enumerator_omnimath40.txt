The problem involves finding the maximum values of two expressions involving a periodic function `a : Fin 41 → ℝ` with certain constraints. To assist in conjecturing and proving, I'll explore possible values of `a i` that meet the constraints, focusing on the edges of bounds imposed by the derivative constraint. 

We'll consider the role of the periodicity, sum constraint, and the maximum difference between neighboring points to generate candidate solutions. For simplicity, I'll assume a linear "worst-case" profile to maximize the sums, then evaluate the expressions for these candidate functions. 

The code will:
- Generate candidate functions with boundary conditions.
- Print candidate sums for the specified indices.
- Focus only on bounds consistent with the derivative constraints.
- Enumerate solutions for representative sample points; these can be refined further if needed.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions based on linear extremal profiles satisfying constraints
# constraints: a 40 = a 0, sum over 0..39 is 0, max |a_i - a_{i+1}| ≤ 1
# Since we're maximizing sums, consider 'upward' and 'downward' linear profiles

max_value_found_s = None
max_value_found_prod = None

# Parameters for extremal profile assumptions
# Let's assume a linear increase from a[0] to a[40], respecting max change of 1 per step
# The change per step is at most 1, so total range over 40 steps is at most 40
# With the sum zero, the profile could be centered to allow maximum at specific indices

# Candidate profiles: linear with slope ±1, centered to satisfy sum constraints
# For maximum a_i at position i, and minimal at position j, with boundary conditions
# We can generate two extremal profiles: increasing and decreasing

# Generate increasing profile
a_increase = []
for i in range(41):
    val = (i * 1) - (20 * 1)  # centered at zero for sum zero
    a_increase.append(val)

# Generate decreasing profile
a_decrease = []
for i in range(41):
    val = -(i * 1) + (20 * 1)
    a_decrease.append(val)

# Function to evaluate sums at indices 9,19,29,39
indices = [9, 19, 29, 39]

# Evaluate first expression: sum of a_i at indices
def sum_at_indices(a):
    return sum(a[i] for i in indices)

# Evaluate second expression: sum of a_i * a_j at specified pairs
pairs = [(9, 19), (29, 39)]
def sum_of_products(a):
    return sum(a[i] * a[j] for i,j in pairs)

# Check profiles
for profile in [a_increase, a_decrease]:
    s_sum = sum_at_indices(profile)
    prod_sum = sum_of_products(profile)
    # Record if they're maximal (here, just print all candidates)
    print(f"Profile: {profile}")
    print(f"Sum at indices {indices}: {s_sum}")
    print(f"Sum of a_i * a_j at pairs {pairs}: {prod_sum}")
```
