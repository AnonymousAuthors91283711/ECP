This problem involves solving a set of equations, some of which resemble temperature conversions and linear equations. The goal appears to be to determine the value of `x + y + z` based on the given relations. To assist in conjecturing the answer, we'll enumerate candidate solutions for each equation with small sample values where appropriate, and then check the combined sum.

Specifically:
- The first equation `(7 * x / 5 + 16 = x)` can be solved algebraically to find exact `x`.
- The second equation involves `y`, resembling Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion: `(7 * y - 80) / 9 = (9 * y / 5 + 32)`.
- The third equation `(z = 9 * z / 5 + 32)` can be solved for `z`.

We'll write code to:
- Scan over small integers for `x`, `y`, and `z` within plausible ranges.
- Check if each candidate satisfies the equations.
- Print candidate solutions and their sums.

This will help in conjecturing the overall sum `x + y + z`.

```python
# Enumerate small integer candidates for x, y, z
for x in range(-100, 101):
    # Check first equation: (7 * x / 5 + 16 == x)
    # Multiplying through by 5 to avoid float inaccuracies
    if 7 * x + 80 == 5 * x:
        print(f"x={x}")
        # Now check y
        for y in range(-100, 101):
            # Second equation: (7 * y - 80)/9 == (9 * y / 5 + 32)
            left = 7 * y - 80
            right = (9 * y * 1.8) + 32 * 1  # Using 9*y/5 = 1.8*y
            # To avoid float errors, cross-multiplied form:
            if 9 * (7 * y - 80) == 9 * (9 * y / 5 + 32) * 1:
                # Simplify second equation algebraically
                # Alternatively, approximate and check
                # But better to do cross multiplication:
                # (7 * y - 80) * 5 == (9 * y + 32 * 5) * 9
                if (7 * y - 80) * 5 == (9 * y + 160) * 9:
                    # Check z satisfying z = 9z/5 + 32
                    # Rearrange: z - 9z/5 = 32
                    # 5z/5 - 9z/5 = 32 => (-4z)/5=32 => -4z=160 => z=-40
                    z = -40
                    print(f"x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")
                    total = x + y + z
                    print(f"Sum Answer: {total}")
```
