The problem is to evaluate, for n = 2005, a specific count defined by a recursive-like function:

count(k) = 
  if k = 0 then 1
  else 4^(k-1) + 2^(k-1)

Given n=2005, we are to compute count(n). The structure suggests no recursion but a direct formula, and the answer appears to be a sum involving exponential functions.

Since the problem is about enumerating answers and verifying the count, the key is to directly compute the value of count(2005):

count(2005) = 4^(2004) + 2^(2004)

We will implement a Python script that computes these two large powers exactly and then sums them:

- Use Python's built-in arbitrary-precision integers.
- Compute 4^(2004) and 2^(2004).
- Print the result.

This approach directly computes the answer without iteration over a large range.

```python
# Compute 4^(2004) and 2^(2004) directly
def compute_count(n):
    power = n - 1
    val1 = pow(4, power)
    val2 = pow(2, power)
    return val1 + val2

result = compute_count(2005)
print(result)
```
