open Polynomial

abbrev omnimath2917_answer : ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath2917 : 
  ∃! a, IsRoot (X^2 + C a * X + 1 : ℤ[X]) 1 ∧ a = omnimath2917_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate a: -2 (since 1 is a root). Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The polynomial is \(X^2 + C a * X + 1\). For 1 to be a root, substitute: \(1^2 + a * 1 + 1 = 0\), so \(a + 2 = 0\). Hence, \(a = -2\).  
Final answer in Lean: <<<(-2 : ℤ)>>>
