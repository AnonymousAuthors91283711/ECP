294
Greatest answer: 294. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The error arises because in Lean, the `abbrev` declaration expects a value of type `ℕ`, but the current candidate is a lambda function (`fun n => ...`)—a function type, not a value. To correct this, we should define the answer as a specific natural number constant, not as a function. The intention, supported by the enumerated answer (which indicates the greatest value is 294), suggests that the answer should be `294`. 

Consolidating this reasoning, the fixed answer would be simply `294 : ℕ`. 

This matches the expected type and fixes the type mismatch error by providing a concrete `ℕ` value rather than a function.

294
Greatest answer: 294. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The main issue is that the current candidate answer is a lambda function, which is incompatible with `abbrev P2005AIMEI_4_answer : ℕ` expecting a natural number. Based on the enumerated answers, the greatest value satisfying the conditions is 294, so the answer should simply be the constant `294`. 

Therefore, the correct fixed answer is:

<<<294>>>

This fixes the type mismatch and aligns with the inferred greatest value from the enumerations.
