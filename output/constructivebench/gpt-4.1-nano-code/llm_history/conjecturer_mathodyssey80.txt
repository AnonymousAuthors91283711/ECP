The main issue with the proposed answer is that it includes a natural language explanation ("Given the candidate points...") which is invalid syntax in Lean. The abbreviation should be a purely functional expression, typically a real number or a formula, not text. 

From the enumerated solutions, the maximum z-value occurs at the intersection point with x ≈ 3.296 and y ≈ 2.519, resulting in z ≈ 32.185. Since the formula for z is 9x + y, and the maximum occurs at that point, the simplest closed-form answer in Lean is to define the function to return that maximum value directly. 

Given the candidates, the maximum z-value is approximately 32.185, which, in Lean, should be written as a real constant. A closed-form approximation suffices, and the input parameters (x, y) are not necessarily needed explicitly unless you want a function that returns this maximum for given inputs, but given no dependency on inputs, it can be a constant function.

To address the error, I will remove the natural language and only include the constant maximum value as the function output.

The error occurs because in Lean, when defining functions with multiple parameters as a single tuple, you must specify the parameter as a tuple (x, y) with parentheses, not as two separate variables. The syntax `fun (x, y : ℝ)` is correct for defining a function with a tuple argument. 

In the current code, the issue is that `abbrev mathodyssey80_answer : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ := sorry` is followed by the function body without proper parentheses. According to Lean syntax, the correct way is:

```lean
abbrev mathodyssey80_answer : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ := fun (x, y) : ℝ × ℝ => ...
```

or equivalently:

```lean
abbrev mathodyssey80_answer : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ := fun p : ℝ × ℝ => ...
```

Given that, and considering the typical pattern from the enumerated solutions, the formula appears to evaluate a candidate point `(x,y)` which maximizes `z = 9*x + y`. The maximum on the feasible region (from the polygons and intersection points) is at the candidate point with `(x, y) ≈ (3.296, 2.519)` giving `z ≈ 32.185`.

Applying these observations, the fixed code should be:

<<<fun (x, y) : ℝ × ℝ => 32.18518518518518>>>

which is a straightforward, correct notation for defining a constant function that disregards the input (or the candidate solution based on the maximal point found). For generalization, as the enumeration points indicate a pattern, the main candidate for the maximum is at the intersection point `(x ≈ 3.296, y ≈ 2.519)` resulting in `z ≈ 32.185`. 

Thus, the fixed answer is:

The main issue is the incorrect syntax used in defining `mathodyssey80_answer`. `abbrev` is not meant to be assigned using `fun` with pairs like `(x, y)`, and the syntax `abbrev mathodyssey80_answer : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ := fun (x, y) : ℝ × ℝ => ...` is invalid in Lean. Instead, the correct way is to specify a lambda function with pattern matching or parameterized variables directly.

Given the enumerated answer points, the consistent candidate from the pattern and the example solutions is the point (x=3.2962962962962963, y=2.518518518518518), which yields the maximum value `z = 9x + y`. To keep within the elegance and format suitable for Lean, I will generalize the answer as a function taking a pair `(x, y)` and returning `9 * x + y`. 

Since the provided enumeration suggests the maximum point occurs near that coordinate, a plausible closed-form answer is just the expression: `9 * x + y`. 

Here's the corrected and general form of the answer:

<<<fun p : ℝ × ℝ => 9 * p.1 + p.2>>>

This lambda takes a pair `p` of real numbers and returns `9 * p.1 + p.2`. It is compatible with the expected type `ℝ × ℝ → ℝ`, and matches the observed maximization candidate.
