The problem involves symmetric relations among a, b, c with specified sums of powers. Given the sum condition \( a + b + c = 0 \), common symmetric identities suggest a relation between quadratic and higher powers. Testing simple values like \( a = x, b = y, c = -(x + y) \), the relation reduces to an expression involving the symmetric sums. When verified, the quadratic sum can be expressed as a fixed constant proportional to the sum of fifth powers under the constraints. The pattern indicates the quadratic sum always equals 2.
