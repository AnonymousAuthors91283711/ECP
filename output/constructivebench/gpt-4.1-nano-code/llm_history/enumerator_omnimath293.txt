This problem involves studying the solutions to the two equations:

1) \(a^3 b - 1 = k(a + 1)\) for some \(k \in \mathbb{N}\),
2) \(b^3 a + 1 = m(b - 1)\) for some \(m \in \mathbb{N}\),

with \(a, b > 0\).

To assist in conjecturing the solutions, we'll programmatically enumerate small \(a, b\), check whether both equations hold with some non-negative integers \(k, m\), and then record solutions.

Since the problem emphasizes exactness and an efficient enumeration, we'll choose small bounds for \(a, b\) (say up to 10) to explore feasible solutions, then print all potential solutions.

```python
# Enumerate small positive integers for a and b
# For each pair, check for existence of k, m satisfying the equations
# We look for integer solutions to the rearranged equations

max_val = 10
results = []

for a in range(1, max_val + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_val + 1):
        # Check whether (a^3 * b - 1) is divisible by (a + 1)
        numerator1 = a**3 * b - 1
        denom1 = a + 1
        if numerator1 % denom1 == 0:
            k = numerator1 // denom1
            # Check whether (b^3 * a + 1) is divisible by (b - 1), b >1 to avoid division by zero
            if b > 1:
                numerator2 = b**3 * a + 1
                denom2 = b - 1
                if numerator2 % denom2 == 0:
                    m = numerator2 // denom2
                    # Record the pair if both equations are satisfied
                    results.append((a, b))
                    print((a, b))
