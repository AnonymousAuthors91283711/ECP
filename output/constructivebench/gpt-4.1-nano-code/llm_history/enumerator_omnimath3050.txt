The problem appears to be a simple arithmetic expression involving basic operations. To assist in conjecturing and proving the true answer, I'll write a Python script that enumerates candidate answers for the given expression, streaming partial results. Since the expression is straightforward, the script will evaluate the expression, print the answer immediately, and ensure the code is ready for an interactive and efficient enumeration.

```python
# Enumerate candidate answers for the provided arithmetic expression
# The expression: 4 * (4 * 5 + 2) + 2

# Compute the value
result = 4 * (4 * 5 + 2) + 2

# Immediately print the result
print(result)
```
