The proposed answer lists several tuples that satisfy the given equations, but it's incomplete. The problem involves solving a system of symmetric equations, and the proposed solution only captures some of the possible solutions (particularly those where two variables are equal and the third is zero or one). However, there might be other solutions where all three variables are distinct or satisfy different relationships. The ground truth answer would likely include all possible solutions, making the proposed answer incomplete but partially correct.
