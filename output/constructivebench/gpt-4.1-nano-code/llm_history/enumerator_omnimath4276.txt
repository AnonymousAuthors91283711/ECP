[write_program]
The problem involves finding pairs of prime numbers \(x, y\) satisfying the equation:

\[ x^y - y^x = x \cdot y^2 - 19 \]

I will write a Python program that enumerates small prime pairs \((x, y)\) to find solutions that satisfy this equation, streaming the solutions immediately when a candidate fits the condition. We will limit the search to small primes (e.g., up to 50) to keep computations efficient and manageable, as the problem seems to be dealing with small parameters.

```python
# Enumerate small prime pairs (x, y) and test the equation:
# x^y - y^x == x * y^2 - 19
# Stream solutions when found.

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

primes = [p for p in range(2, 50) if is_prime(p)]

for x in primes:
    for y in primes:
        lhs = x**y - y**x
        rhs = x * y**2 - 19
        if lhs == rhs:
            print(f"Solution found: x={x}, y={y}")
```
