The problem is asking for the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( n \) is a perfect square, divisible by 2023, and greater than zero. 

To solve this, I will:
1. Find the prime factorization of 2023.
2. For \( n \) to be divisible by 2023 and a perfect square, \( n \) must include the prime factors of 2023 with even exponents.
3. Since \( n \) is a perfect square, the minimal \( n \) will be the multiple of 2023 where the exponents of all prime factors are even.

2023 is prime (since it has no divisors other than 1 and itself). So, the smallest \( n \) that is divisible by 2023 and is a perfect square must be \( 2023 \times 2023 = 2023^2 \), making the exponent of 2023 even.

Let's verify this minimal candidate. 

```python
# Enumerate the smallest perfect square multiple of 2023
# Since 2023 is prime, the smallest n is 2023 * 2023 = 2023^2
# This guarantees n is divisible by 2023 and a perfect square

# Compute 2023^2
candidate = 2023 * 2023
print(candidate)
```

This code finds and prints the minimal such number.
