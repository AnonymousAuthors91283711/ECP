This problem seems to involve finding the set of real numbers α such that, for all positive integers n, the sum \( S(\alpha, n) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \lfloor (i+1) \alpha \rfloor \) is divisible by n. To explore possible answers, we'll evaluate small α values and compute the sum modulo n for various n, looking for patterns or special values.

Here's a Python program that checks various α candidate values (including some rational approximations and special points like 0, 1/2, 1, etc.) against the condition \( S(\alpha, n) \equiv 0 \pmod{n} \) for small n up to a limit. It reports all α satisfying the condition for tested n.

```python
import math

# Candidate alpha values, including some rational and special points
alphas = [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 2]

# Maximum n to check
max_n = 10

# Function to compute S(alpha, n)
def S(alpha, n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += math.floor((i + 1) * alpha)
    return total

# Check which alphas satisfy the divisibility condition for all n
satisfying_alphas = []

for alpha in alphas:
    all_divisible = True
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        if S(alpha, n) % n != 0:
            all_divisible = False
            break
    if all_divisible:
        print(f"Alpha satisfying condition: {alpha}")
        satisfying_alphas.append(alpha)
```

This code searches for α in a small, manageable set, verifying the divisibility condition for n up to 10. The output lists all α in the set that satisfy the divisibility condition for these n values, aiding in conjecturing the general form of the solution set.
