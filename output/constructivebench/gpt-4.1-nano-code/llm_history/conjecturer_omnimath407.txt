  Nat.card {x : ℝ | arctan x = x^2 - 1.6} = omnimath407_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found root at x ≈ -0.9241279296874996
Found root at x ≈ 1.6177597656250002
Total solutions: 2. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The roots are approximately -0.9241 and 1.6178, both real solutions to arctan x = x^2 - 1.6. Since we are counting solutions, the total solutions are 2. Thus, the answer is 2.
