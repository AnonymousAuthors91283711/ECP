Ground Truth Answer: fun (x, y) => 9 * x + y
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℝ × ℝ => 9 * p.1 + p.2
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both answers define a function that takes a pair of real numbers (x, y) and returns the value 9x + y. The proposed answer uses pattern matching with p.1 and p.2 to access the components of the pair, while the ground truth answer directly uses x and y, but they compute the same result. The theorem statement is about finding the maximum value of 9x + y under given constraints, and both answers correctly represent this objective function.
