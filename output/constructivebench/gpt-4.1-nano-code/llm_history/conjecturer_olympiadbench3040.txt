(hn : n > 0)
(hfrac : (∑ i in Finset.Icc 1 n, 3 * i) / (∑ i in Finset.Icc 1 n, 5 * i) = 4 / 11)
: (∑ i in Finset.Icc 1 n, 2 * i) / (∑ i in Finset.Icc 1 n, 4 * i) = olympiadbench3040_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The ratio simplifies to (∑ i in [1..n], 2i)/(∑ i in [1..n], 4i) = (n(n+1))/2 * 2 / ((n(n+1))/2 * 4) = 2/4 = 1/2.  
Thus, the answer is 1/2.
