The problem involves finding all positive divisors \( d \) of \( 12! \) such that \( d \% 3 = 1 \). The factorial \( 12! = 479001600 \). We need to find all such divisors, then print their count. Since directly enumerating all divisors can be large, but manageable for 12!, we can:

- Factor 12! to determine all divisors
- Filter divisors satisfying \( d \% 3 = 1 \)
- Count them and output the result

Let's write a Python program to do this efficiently.

```python
# Prime factorization of 12!
# 12! = 2^10 * 3^5 * 5^2 * 7^1 * 11^1
# Generate divisors from prime factors and filter by modulus

from math import prod

# Prime exponents in 12!
prime_factors = {
    2: 10,
    3: 5,
    5: 2,
    7: 1,
    11: 1
}

def generate_divisors(prime_exps):
    # Generate all divisors from prime exponents
    primes = list(prime_exps.keys())
    exps_list = [range(prime_exps[p] + 1) for p in primes]
    divisors = []
    for exps in product(*exps_list):
        d = 1
        for p, e in zip(primes, exps):
            d *= p ** e
        divisors.append(d)
    return divisors

from itertools import product

divisors = generate_divisors(prime_factors)
count = 0
for d in divisors:
    if d % 3 == 1:
        print(d)
        count += 1
print("Total:", count)
```
