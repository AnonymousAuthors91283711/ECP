    (if x ∉ alice ∧ x ∈ bob ∧ x ∈ charlie then (1 : ℚ) else 0) * (3/4) * (1/5) * (1/6)) = omnimath510_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Element 5: not in alice, in bob, in charlie -> contribution=0.025
Total sum of contributions: 0.025. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The sum only has contributions when x is in all three sets, because the other cases have zero contributions. For x=5 (the common element), the contribution is (1) * (1/4) * (1/5) * (5/6) = 1/4 * 1/5 * 5/6 = 1/4 * 1/6 = 1/24. The total sum is thus 1/24. 

Final answer:
<<<1/24>>>
