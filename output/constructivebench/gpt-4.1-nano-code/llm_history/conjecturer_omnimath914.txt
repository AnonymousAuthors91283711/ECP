Total count: 36. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The elements are integers within [2, 101] where powers stabilize modulo 100. The pattern suggests selecting all such fixed points, which are those integers with multiplicative order dividing some power of 2 modulo 100. The answer total is 36.  
Therefore, the minimal closed form capturing all such elements is 36.
