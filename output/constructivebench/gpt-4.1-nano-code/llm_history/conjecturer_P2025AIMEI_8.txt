theorem P2025AIMEI_8 :
  let S := {k : ℝ | ∃! (z : ℂ), Complex.abs (25 + 20*I - z) = 5 ∧ Complex.abs (z - 4 - k) = Complex.abs (z - 3*I - k)}
  ∃ (T : Finset ℝ), (∀ k, k ∈ T ↔ k ∈ S) ∧ T.sum id = P2025AIMEI_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Sum of all k: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the pattern, the sum includes all real k satisfying the specified conditions, which appear to be symmetric around 0, with some translation by constants. The enumeration hints at the sum being 0, likely due to symmetry or cancellation.
