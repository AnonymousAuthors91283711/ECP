Given the symmetry and the structure of the equations, substituting the expressions and simplifying suggests \( x = y \). Then, from the definitions: \( x = \log_{10}(10^{y-1}+1)-1 \), \( y = \log_{10}(10^{x}+1)-1 \). Using \( x = y \) leads to \( 10^{x-1} + 1 = 10^{x} + 1 \), implying \( 10^{x-1} = 10^{x} \), so \( 10^{x} \) must be \( 0.1 \). Then, \( 10^{x - y} = 0.1 \). 

Answer:
<<<0.1>>>
