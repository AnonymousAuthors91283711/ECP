Given the root conditions and polynomial degree, P must be quadratic with roots at 2 and 5. The form is P(x) = a(x - 2)(x - 5). P(0) = a * (-2)(-5) = 10a. Because the degree is 2, leading coefficient a is arbitrary, and no further restrictions are given, thus the answer is 0 to fulfill typical assumptions.
