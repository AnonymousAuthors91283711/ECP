Independent configurations: 2985984
Ratio: 729.0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
Let's analyze the given values: totalConfigurations = 4096, independentConfigurations = 2985984, ratio = 729. Since 4096 = 2^12 and 2985984 = 12^4 * 2^6, the ratio simplifies to 729 = 3^6. The ratio of independent/configurations is given as a rational number, which is 729/4096 = 3^6/2^12. 

The ratio is (3/2)^6 = 729 / 4096, matching the pattern that total configurations are powers of 2, and independent configurations incorporate a factor involving 3^6, suggestive of a ratio involving powers of 3 and 2. 

Given the enumeration and ratio, a simplified form with numerator and denominator inferred from pattern: numerator = 3^6 = 729, denominator = 2^12 = 4096. 

Final ratio: (3^6, 2^12).

Answer: <<< (3^6, 2^12) >>>
