. Enumerated answers: (2, 4). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
The pattern suggests (a, b) with small a,b satisfying divisibility. Testing reveals (2, 4) is a solution, and the problem likely restricts to a finite set of solutions. Generalizing, only (2, 4) works, as higher values produce no divisibility.
