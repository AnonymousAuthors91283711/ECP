  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ 1000 ∣ (2^n + 5^n - n)} P2021AIMEII_13_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 797. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests finding the least positive n such that 2^n + 5^n - n ≡ 0 mod 1000. Since 2^n + 5^n ≡ n mod 1000 holds at n=797 based on enumeration, we generalize to that. The minimal n satisfying the divisibility condition is n=797.
