The given code snippet appears to be an attempt at a theorem involving logarithms, but it contains placeholders and references to `Mathlib`. Since the goal is to assist in conjecturing and potentially proving the value of `3 * log_b 7 23`, let's interpret the problem: find the exact value or approximate value of `3 * log_b 7 23` in real numbers.

Note: `log_b 7 23` is the logarithm of 23 base 7, which can be expressed as `ln 23 / ln 7`. Multiplying by 3 gives `3 * (ln 23 / ln 7)`.

We will enumerate approximate values:

- For small sample calculations, assume `ln 7 ≈ 1.9459`, `ln 23 ≈ 3.1355`.
- Compute approximately: `3 * (3.1355 / 1.9459)`.

Here's a Python program to produce this approximation which can help in conjecturing the exact value or form:

```python
import math

# Sample parameters
ln7 = math.log(7)       # approximate ln 7
ln23 = math.log(23)     # approximate ln 23

# compute the logarithm of 23 base 7
log_b_7_23 = ln23 / ln7

# multiply by 3
result = 3 * log_b_7_23

# Print the approximate result
print("Approximate value of 3 * log_b 7 23:", result)

# If needed, print more detailed intermediate steps
print("ln 7:", ln7)
print("ln 23:", ln23)
print("log_b 7 23:", log_b_7_23)
```

This code provides an approximate numeric answer, useful for conjecturing. The value is around  (3 * 3.1355 / 1.9459) ≈ 4.835, which suggests `3 * log_b 7 23 ≈ 4.835`.

```python
import math

ln7 = math.log(7)
ln23 = math.log(23)
log_b_7_23 = ln23 / ln7
result = 3 * log_b_7_23
print("Approximate answer:", result)
```
