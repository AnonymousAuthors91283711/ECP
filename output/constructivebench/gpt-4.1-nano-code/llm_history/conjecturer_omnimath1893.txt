. Enumerated answers: n = 1.1666666666666667. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the relations: (a + b)/a = 3, (b + c)/b = 4, (c + a)/c = n, we find n in terms of a, b, c. Solving these, n = (a + c)/c. Expressing a and c in terms of b and the ratios, the final value simplifies to n = 7/6. Therefore, the answer is a fixed rational number.
