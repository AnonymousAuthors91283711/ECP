The problem involves solving a system of two linear equations with parameters and then computing a specific linear combination of the solutions. Given T = 40, the equations simplify to a system in x and y:

1. x + 9y = 17  
2. 40x + 41y = 42

Our goal: find all solutions (x, y), then compute 20x + 14y for those solutions. Since the equations are linear, we can solve them analytically, but the task is to enumerate possible solutions, perhaps exploring approximate solutions or potential alternatives. This is a straightforward linear system; here, we'll solve for the exact x and y, then compute the expression.

Let's write a Python program to:
- Use numerator/denominator algebra (for exact solutions)
- Replace T with 40
- Solve the equations symbolically
- Enumerate and print solutions

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational

# Define symbols
x, y = symbols('x y')

# Parameters
T_value = 40

# Equations with T substituted
eq1 = Eq(x + 9 * y, 17)
eq2 = Eq(T_value * x + (T_value + 1) * y, T_value + 2)

# Solve the system analytically
solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))
# solution is a dict: {x: value, y: value}

# Extract solutions
for sol in solution:
    x_val = solution[sol] if isinstance(solution, dict) else solution.x
    y_val = solution[sol] if isinstance(solution, dict) else solution.y
    # Compute 20x + 14y
    answer = 20 * x_val + 14 * y_val
    print(f"Solution: x={x_val}, y={y_val}, 20x+14y={answer}")
```
