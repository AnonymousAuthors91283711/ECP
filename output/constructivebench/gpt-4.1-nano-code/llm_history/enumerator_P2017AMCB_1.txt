The problem involves finding a natural number answer such that the equation 10 + 6 * x = 2 * (30 + 2 * x) holds, and verifying that for all smaller m, the inequality 10 + 6 * m < 2 * (30 + 2 * m) holds true.

Let's analyze the equation:
10 + 6x = 2(30 + 2x)
=> 10 + 6x = 60 + 4x
=> 6x - 4x = 60 - 10
=> 2x = 50
=> x = 25

We need to check whether all smaller m < 25 satisfy the inequality:
10 + 6m < 2(30 + 2m)
=> 10 + 6m < 60 + 4m
=> 6m - 4m < 60 - 10
=> 2m < 50
=> m < 25

This is true for all m < 25, confirming the answer x=25.

Now, we implement a Python script that enumerates all possible answers up to some small threshold (say up to 30), computes the candidates matching the equation, and confirms the inequalities for smaller values.

```python
# The code searches for the value satisfying the equation and verifies the inequality
for candidate in range(0, 30):
    left = 10 + 6 * candidate
    right = 2 * (30 + 2 * candidate)
    if left == right:
        # Found the candidate satisfying the equation
        answer = candidate
        print(f'Candidate answer: {answer}')
        # Verify the inequality for all smaller m
        all_less = True
        for m in range(answer):
            if not (10 + 6 * m < 2 * (30 + 2 * m)):
                all_less = False
                break
        if all_less:
            print(f'Answer satisfying both conditions: {answer}')
```
