abbrev omnimath1911_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1911 :
  let S := Icc 1 6
  let A := card (Finset.univ : Finset (Sym2 (S ×ˢ S)))
  let B := card (Finset.univ : Finset (Sym2 S × Sym2 S))
  A - B = omnimath1911_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: S = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Number of ordered pairs (x != y): 30
Number of unordered pairs (x < y): 15
B (square of unordered pairs): 225
Difference A - B: -195. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
