Ground Truth Answer: 7^7 * 11^7 * 13^7
Proposed Answer: 7^3 * 11^2 * 13^2 * 19^2 * 29^2 * 37^2 * 41^2* 43 * 47 * 53 * 59 * 61 * 67 * 71* 73 * 79 * 83 * 89* 97
Let's analyze both answers:

1. Ground Truth: 7^7 * 11^7 * 13^7
   - Calculates to (7*11*13)^7 = 1001^7
   - 1001^7 = 1007021035035021007001 (which matches the left side of the equation)

2. Proposed Answer: The proposed answer is a much more complex factorization involving many primes with various exponents, but notably missing the correct exponents for 7, 11, and 13.

The two factorizations are clearly different, and only the ground truth answer correctly matches the given number when calculated.
