The problem describes configurations on a 3×3×3 cube with exactly 2 face-visible "true" cubes, with the red-visible faces condition. The key is notable: the total is based on selecting 2 visible cubes with certain face conditions out of 27. The combinatorial pattern suggests that the total count corresponds to choosing 2 cubes with visible faces, considering the 3x3 faces, likely leading to combinations like 3×3×k.
