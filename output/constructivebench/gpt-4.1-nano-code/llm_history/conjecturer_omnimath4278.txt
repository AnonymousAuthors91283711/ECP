. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the conditions, the intersection's size relates directly to the divisibility of subset cardinalities. Since the minimal intersection size is 1 from enumeration, the least such n satisfying the given conditions is 1.  
Therefore, the answer should be the minimal possible intersection size consistent with the properties, which is 1.
