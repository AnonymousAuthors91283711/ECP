Maximum k satisfying the condition is: 99. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem asks for the largest subset s of Fin 100 where prime indices in s are more numerous than multiples of 4 in s, with the maximum size being 99. Since the set of primes exceeds the set of multiples of 4 by 1, choosing the maximal subset missing just a single multiple of 4 element achieves size 99.  
Therefore, the answer is the size 99, which aligns with the maximum subset size satisfying the condition.

Current Proposed Answer: The problem asks for the largest subset s of Fin 100 where prime indices in s are more numerous than multiples of 4 in s, with the maximum size being 99. Since the set of primes exceeds the set of multiples of 4 by 1, choosing the maximal subset missing just a single multiple of 4 element achieves size 99.  
Therefore, the answer is the size 99, which aligns with the maximum subset size satisfying the condition.

Maximum k satisfying the condition is: 99. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The existing text contains a syntax error: the phrase "where prime indices in s are more numerous than multiples of 4 in s" is informal and appears outside the formal Lean syntax, causing the parser error on "where." To fix this, I should convert that into the formal Lean language within the proof or definition. 

Given the problem's description, the key is determining the size of the largest subset s of Fin 100 such that the number of prime indices (i.e., i ∈ s with i + 1 prime) exceeds the number of multiples of 4 (i.e., i + 1 divisible by 4) in s, and the maximum size appears to be 99, based on the enumeration that the primes are 25 in number within the first 100 natural numbers, and the multiples of 4 are 24 such.

Hence, the largest such s would be of size 99, choosing all except a single multiple of 4.

In code, the answer is thus 99, and the formal Lean answer is simply that. I will replace 'sorry' with the correct maximal value, which is 99, and ensure the syntax is valid.

Because the code wants an answer for the "abbrev" to match with the maximum size, I will write the answer as a constant 99, perhaps derived from the enumeration and reasoning.
