theorem P2018AMCA_12 : 
  IsLeast {k : ℕ | ∃ (S : Finset ℕ), S.card = 6 ∧ (S : Set ℕ) ⊆ Icc 1 12 ∧ 
    ∀ a ∈ S, ∀ b ∈ S, a < b → ¬ (a ∣ b)} P2018AMCA_12_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No such subset found.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem asks for the minimal ℕ satisfying the property, but the enumeration indicates no such subset exists, implying the answer should reflect the absence.  
Hence, the minimal ℕ can be represented as 0, indicating no such subset.  
Thus, the Lean expression is:

<<<0>>>
