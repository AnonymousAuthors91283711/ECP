Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: { (a, b, c) | a = 2 ∧ b = 4 ∧ c = 8} ∪ { (a, b, c) | a = 3 ∧ b = 5 ∧ c = 15}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer provides two specific solutions (2,4,8) and (3,5,15) that satisfy the given conditions, but it doesn't cover all possible solutions. The ground truth answer (which we don't know) would likely include all possible triplets (a,b,c) that satisfy the conditions, not just these two examples. Therefore, the proposed answer is partially correct but incomplete.
