The problem involves placing points in an 8x8 grid with constraints on attack patterns and an odd sum. Patterns suggest maximum placements correspond to diagonally independent points avoiding shared rows/columns with parity conditions. The maximum number of such points aligns with a non-attacking configuration like the diagonal with no overlaps. The maximum is 8, as it corresponds to placing 8 points along the main diagonal where no two share row or column and the attack counts are minimal and odd.
