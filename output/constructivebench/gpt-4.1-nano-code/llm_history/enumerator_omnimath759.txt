[write_program]
Below is a Python program that systematically searches for the greatest natural number \( n \leq 200 \) satisfying the given condition:

The condition states: for each candidate \( n \), for all \( k \leq 200 \), the absolute difference \( |n - X| \) is less than or equal to \( |k - X| \), where \( X = 3 + \frac{107 + 99n}{200} \).

By enumerating candidate \( n \) from 200 downward, we identify the maximum \( n \) such that the condition holds for all \( k \).  

The program streams all candidates that satisfy the condition, ending with the greatest valid \( n \).

```python
# Program to find the greatest n â‰¤ 200 satisfying the given condition

# Define the maximum n to check
max_n = 200

# Function to compute X for a given n
def compute_X(n):
    return 3 + (107 + 99 * n) / 200

# Iterate from largest to smallest candidate n
for n in range(max_n, -1, -1):
    X = compute_X(n)
    all_good = True
    for k in range(0, 201):
        diff_n = abs(n - X)
        diff_k = abs(k - X)
        if diff_n > diff_k:
            all_good = False
            break
    if all_good:
        print("Answer candidate n:", n)
        # Since we are enumerating from top, first found will be greatest
        break
```
