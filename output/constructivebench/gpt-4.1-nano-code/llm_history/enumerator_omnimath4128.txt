This problem appears to involve polynomial interpolation and sequence properties. The challenge is to explore all functions \( a: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) satisfying certain conditions related to polynomial evaluation and finite product formulas.

Given the task, I will:
- Focus on small parameter values (e.g., \( k=2,3 \)).
- Enumerate candidate polynomials of degree \(k\), with non-negative coefficients (since the coefficients' constraints are \( \geq 0 \) for certain degrees).
- For each candidate polynomial, verify if the sequence \(a(n)\) satisfies the product relation.
- Generate all such sequences for small cases and print the sequences to assist in conjecturing the set.

Here's the Python code implementing this idea, considering only small \(k\), with enumerations up to small bounds for coefficients and \(a(n)\):

```python
# Enumerate polynomial coefficients for small degrees and generate candidate sequences
from itertools import product

def evaluate_poly(coeffs, x):
    return sum(c * (x ** i) for i, c in enumerate(coeffs))

def product_of_sequence(a, n, k):
    prod = 1
    for i in range(k):
        prod *= a(n + 1 + i)
    return prod

# For small k, enumerate polynomials of degree k-1 with non-negative coefficients up to some max coefficient
max_coeff = 5
max_a_value = 10
k_values = [2, 3]
for k in k_values:
    print(f"Exploring solutions for k={k}")
    # Enumerate coefficient tuples for degree k-1
    for coeffs in product(range(max_coeff + 1), repeat=k):
        # Skip polynomial if leading coefficient is zero (not a degree k polynomial)
        if coeffs[-1] == 0:
            continue
        # For a small set of a(n), say n=0 to 4, test the relation
        a_vals = []
        valid = True
        for n in range(5):
            # For each n, check if there exists an a(n) satisfying the relation
            for aval in range(max_a_value + 1):
                seq_a = [aval]
                # Generate sequence a(n+1), a(n+2), ..., a(n + k)
                # Simplify by assuming sequence is constant or linear for small test
                # For the purpose of enumeration, just pick the same a(n) for all
                # (since sequences could be constant in initial exploration)
                if all((a_val if i==0 else a_vals[i-1]) == aval for i in range(1, k+1)):
                    val = evaluate_poly(coeffs, n)
                    prod_val = 1
                    for i in range(k):
                        prod_val *= aval
                    if val != prod_val:
                        break
            else:
                continue
            break
        else:
            # If for all n, polynomial matches the product with chosen a(n)
            # List candidate sequence if possible
            print(f"Possible polynomial coefficients of degree {k-1}: {coeffs}")
            print(f"Candidate sequences (a(n)= {aval} for n=0..4): {aval}")

# Note: This is a simplified enumeration targeting small small cases.
```
