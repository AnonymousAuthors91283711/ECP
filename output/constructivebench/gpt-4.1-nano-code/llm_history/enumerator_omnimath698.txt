Let's analyze the problem: We have four positive angles \(w, x, y, z\) with sum \(2\pi\). They satisfy four tangents-related equations involving a parameter \(k\). The goal is to determine the value of \(k\).

Given the symmetry in the equations, and the constraints, a good approach is to test small positive angles that sum to \(2\pi\). Since tangent behaves periodically, discretize over small angles, check the equations, and look for consistent \(k\).

The approach:
- Pick small sample angles for \(w, x, y, z\) summing to approximately \(2\pi\).
- For each set, compute \(k\) using the equations for one angle (e.g., \(w\)), then verify the other three equations.
- When all four are consistent, output the corresponding \(k\).

Since the problem asks only for answers and no inputs, we will execute a simple search over small angles.

```python
import math

# Due to the problem's nature, we'll consider angles that sum close to 2*pi (~6.283)
# Discretize angles in small steps and check for consistent solutions

step = 0.2
max_angle = 2 * math.pi
answers = set()

# Generate combinations such that sum is approximately 2*pi

This high school-level problem involves solving a set of trigonometric equations with positivity constraints and sum conditions, likely expecting a specific value for k under particular angles summing to 2π. The provided enumeration program discretizes angles and attempts to find consistent solutions, but it outputs nothing, indicating it failed to find any candidate solutions within the parameter grid.

**Judgement:**
- The code's discretization step (`step = 0.2`) might be too coarse to find solutions, especially given the sensitive nature of the equations.
- The thresholds used for checking equalities and differences (`0.05`) may be too strict or too loose, depending on the modeling.
- The ranges for the angles are limited to integer steps up to `2π`, which might miss solutions as solutions could be at angles not aligned with these steps.
- The code does not explicitly handle potential singularities or very small denominators well.
- Overall, the approach isn't robust enough to guarantee finding the solution if it exists; the physical intuition suggests the solution should be at specific angles, possibly nice fractions of π.

**Acceptance:**
Given that the code outputs nothing at all despite the conditions, the current code should be rejected. It is not providing a consistent answer, nor does it conclusively say the answer is none.

**Correction:**
- To improve chances, reduce the step size to 0.1 or 0.05.
- Instead of brute-force, consider targeting known angles where tangent and cosine are simple rationals (like 0, π/2, π, etc.).
- Enforce better bounds and avoid floating-point issues with small denominators.
- Explicitly print when no solutions are found after entire enumeration.

Here's an improved, more systematic approach with finer sampling and explicit answer extraction:

```python
import math

# Using smaller step for finer grid
step = 0.1
max_angle = 2 * math.pi
answers = set()

# Generate angles w,x,y with sum approximately 2*pi
for w_step in [i * step for i in range(1, int(max_angle / step))]:
    w = w_step
    for x_step in [i * step for i in range(1, int((max_angle - w) / step))]:
        x = x_step
        for y_step in [i * step for i in range(1, int((max_angle - w - x) / step))]:
            y =

The given problem appears to be a mathematical theorem involving trigonometric relations among angles w, x, y, z, constrained by their sum and positivity. The theorem relates their tangents via a parameter k, with additional conditions on cosines. 

However, the provided code is incomplete and does not contain any executable logic; it's just a formal declaration with a 'sorry' placeholder, and the enumerator output indicates an empty (non-existent) program.

**Judgement:**
Since there is no computational code or enumeration, the program does not generate any answers, and the output shows an error. According to the instructions, the program must enumerate solutions and output answers, even approximate ones, streaming them step-by-step.

**Acceptance:**
The original program is rejected because it is empty and does not comply with the requirements for enumeration, streaming results, or actual computations. Also, the entire setup appears incomplete or a stub, not suitable for execution or enumeration.
