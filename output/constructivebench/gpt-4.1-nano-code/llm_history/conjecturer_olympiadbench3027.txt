The problem involves understanding the relationship between the roots of the cubic polynomial and the parameter T, with roots close to 19 and small perturbations, based on the enumeration provided. The polynomial's coefficients relate to the roots, and the sum of squares appears to be roughly constant around 362, regardless of T.

From the coefficients and roots approximate values, and given the explicit enumeration with "root" values summing up in a pattern, I observe that the roots are roughly: 
- The main root near 19, with small deviations
- The other roots summing close to zero, roughly ±0.5

Given the polynomial:

\[
(X - a)(X - b)(X - c) = X^3 - 20X^2 + 19X + CT,
\]

by Viète's formulas:
- \(a + b + c = 20\),
- \(ab + ac + bc = 19\),
- \(abc = -C T\).

From the enumeration, T seems to influence the roots marginally, but the sum of squares \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\) remains approximately 362, regardless of T, which suggests a formula:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + ac + bc) = 20^2 - 2(19) = 400 - 38 = 362.
\]

This is consistent across all T values.

Therefore, the answer independent of T is:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 362.
\]

Since the problem asks for an expression involving T, but the sum of squares is unaffected by T (constant at 362), the most natural formula in Lean is:

\[
\boxed{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 362}.
\]

Here's how I write the final answer in Lean with the required syntax:

<<<
362
>>>

This fixed form covers the insights from the pattern and avoids dependence on T, consistent with the approximate roots and invariance observed in the enumeration.
