abbrev omnimath1122_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath1122 : 
  (choose 6 4) * (2/3)^5 * (1/3)^2 + (choose 6 4) * (1/3)^5 * (2/3)^2 = omnimath1122_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 20/81
Proposed Answer: (37 : ℚ) / 150
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating a probability expression involving combinations and probabilities. Specifically, it's calculating:
   - C(6,4) * (2/3)^5 * (1/3)^2 plus
   - C(6,4) * (1/3)^5 * (2/3)^2

2. Calculating C(6,4) = 15
3. First term: 15 * (32/243) * (1/9) = 15 * 32 / 2187 = 480/2187
4. Second term: 15 * (1/243) * (4/9) = 15 * 4 / 2187 = 60/2187
5. Sum: (480 + 60)/2187 = 540/2187 = 20/81 (simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 27)

The ground truth answer is 20/81, which matches our calculation. The proposed answer is 37/150, which is approximately 0.2467, while 20/81 ≈ 0.2469. While numerically close, they are not mathematically equivalent.
