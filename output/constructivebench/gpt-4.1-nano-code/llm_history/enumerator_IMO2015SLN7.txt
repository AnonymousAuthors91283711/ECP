This problem involves understanding the constraints on functions f : ℕ → ℕ such that for all distinct m, n, the gcd of (f m + n) and (f n + m) is at most k. To explore possible values of k, we can search for minimal or maximal k values satisfying this property.

Here's the approach:
- For small k, generate candidate functions f with manageable ranges (e.g., f(n) in {0,1,2}).
- Verify whether the property holds for all pairs (m, n) with m ≠ n.
- Enumerate all such functions systematically.
- If a function satisfies the property for given k, output it.

This hasn't been fully proven, but we can try small k and small function ranges to observe trends.

```python
# Enumerator to explore possible functions f: ℕ → ℕ with small domain
# and verify the gcd condition for all pairs. We'll test k from 0 to 5.
# For simplicity, limit to domain {0, 1, 2, 3} and functions with small outputs.
import math
from itertools import product

# Define the maximum value for the domain to check
max_n = 3
# Define the range of possible function values
f_values = range(4)
# List to store valid functions for each k
valid_functions_by_k = {}

for k in range(6):
    valid_functions = []
    # Generate all possible functions over the small domain
    for f_list in product(f_values, repeat=max_n + 1):
        def f(n):
            return f_list[n]
        # Check the property for all pairs m < n
        valid = True
        for m in range(max_n + 1):
            for n in range(m + 1, max_n + 1):
                gcd_value = math.gcd(f(m) + n, f(n) + m)
                if gcd_value > k:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            valid_functions.append(f_list)
            print(f"Valid for k={k}: f={f_list}")
    valid_functions_by_k[k] = valid_functions

# The output streams all functions satisfying the gcd condition for each k up to 5.
# This helps in conjecturing minimal k for which such functions exist.
