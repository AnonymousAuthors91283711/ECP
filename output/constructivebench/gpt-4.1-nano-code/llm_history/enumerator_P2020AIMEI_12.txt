This problem involves finding the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( 3^3 \times 5^5 \times 7^7 \) divides \( 149^k - 2^k \), and we want to analyze the divisors of that \( n \).

Key points:
- The divisor condition involves modular divisibility and prime factorizations.
- The problem is asking for the minimal such \( n \), matching a particular divisor count.

Given the primes involved and the exponents, the main challenge is to determine properties of \( 149^k - 2^k \) modulo the primes, especially 3, 5, and 7, and their powers.

We'll:
- Select small \( k \) values,
- Check divisibility,
- Find the minimal \( k \) satisfying the divisibility,
- Compute the number of divisors for that \( n \).

Here's a Python code to automate this, focusing on efficiency:

```python
import math

# prime powers
p3, p5, p7 = 3**3, 5**5, 7**7
target_divisor = p3 * p5 * p7

def divisors_count(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 2 if i != n // i else 1
    return count

# Since we're looking for the minimal k, iterate starting from 1 upwards
k = 1
while True:
    val = 149**k - 2**k
    # check divisibility by target prime powers
    if (val % p3 == 0 and 
        val % p5 == 0 and 
        val % p7 == 0):
        # found minimal k
        n = k
        divisor_count = divisors_count(n)
        print(f"k={k}, n={n}, divisors={divisor_count}")
        break
    k += 1
```

This code:
- Iterates over small \( k \),
- Checks divisibility conditions directly,
- Finds the minimal \( n \) and its divisor count immediately.
- Streams the results upon discovery.

Make sure to run this code in an environment where `math` module is available. The divisors count is straightforward for small \( n \), fulfilling efficiency and correctness criteria efficiently.

This approach allows you to identify the minimal \( n \) satisfying the problem's divisibility constraints and to analyze its divisors directly.
