To solve this problem, I will enumerate all possible combinations of variables `(a, b, c, d, e, f)` satisfying the given equations, then compute the number of even variables `k`. Since the equations are linear and the variables are non-negative integers, Iâ€™ll iterate over reasonable small bounds based on the equations' sums. The goal is to find the minimal `k` satisfying the constraints.

Steps:
- Use small sample ranges for `a, b, c, d, e, f`, considering their sums.
- For each combination, check if the equations are satisfied.
- Count the even variables.
- Track the minimal `k` found and output each candidate as soon as found to adhere to the streaming approach.
- Since the problem asks for the least `k`, keep track of the minimal found so far, and only update when a smaller one is found.

Here is the implementation:

```python
# Enumerate all solutions to the given equations and find the minimal number of even variables
min_k = None
# Based on the equations, the variables are bounded by their sums
for a in range(27):  # since a + b = 26, a <= 26
    for b in range(27):
        if a + b == 26:
            for c in range(41):  # total sum considerations
                for d in range(41):
                    if a + b + c + d == 41:
                        for e in range(57):
                            for f in range(57):
                                if a + b + c + d + e + f == 57:
                                    # Count even variables
                                    variables = [a, b, c, d, e, f]
                                    k = sum(1 for v in variables if v % 2 == 0)
                                    if min_k is None or k < min_k:
                                        min_k = k
                                        print(f"Candidate: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, e={e}, f={f}, even_count={k}")
print(f"Minimum number of even variables: {min_k}")
```
