This problem appears to involve combinatorics, specifically selecting 6 elements from the set {1, 2, ..., 12} such that no element divides another within the selected set (i.e., an antichain under divisibility). The goal is to find the least such number k where a set of size 6 exists with these properties, within the interval [1, 12].

Given the constraints:
- The set S has 6 elements,
- S is within [1, 12],
- No element divides another in S,
- We seek the minimal such k, meaning the minimal maximum element needed to guarantee such a set.

Since the problem asks for enumerations, I'll write a code that:
- Checks all 6-element subsets of {1,.., 12},
- Filters those with no divisibility relation,
- Tracks the maximum element in such subsets,
- Finds the minimal maximum element that allows a valid subset of size 6.

Here's the Python code to perform this enumeration:

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Define the set from 1 to 12
elements = range(1, 13)

# Initialize a variable to track the minimal maximum element for such subsets
min_max_element = None

for subset in combinations(elements, 6):
    # Check if no element divides another within the subset
    if all(not a != b and (a == b or not (a % b == 0 or b % a == 0))
           for a in subset for b in subset):
        max_elem = max(subset)
        print(f"Found subset: {subset} with max element {max_elem}")
        if min_max_element is None or max_elem < min_max_element:
            min_max_element = max_elem

if min_max_element is not None:
    print(f"Minimum maximum element for a size-6 antichain: {min_max_element}")
else:
    print("No such subset found.")
```
