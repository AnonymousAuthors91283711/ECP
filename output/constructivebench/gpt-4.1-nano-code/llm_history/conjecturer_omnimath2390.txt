noncomputable abbrev omnimath2390_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2390 : 
  IsGreatest {x : ℝ | ∃ (k : ℕ), k ≤ x ∧ x < k + 1 ∧ ⌊x⌋ / x = 2015 / 2016} 
  (2015 + omnimath2390_answer) ∧ 
  Int.fract (2015 + omnimath2390_answer) = omnimath2390_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Maximum x satisfying conditions: 2014.9995037220845
Corresponding k: 2014
Fractional part of 2015 + answer: 0.9995037220842278. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The problem asks for the greatest x of the form 2015 + fractional part, satisfying the given equation with some integer k. From the enumeration, the fractional part is close to 1 but less than 1; the maximum x is just less than 2015 + 1, near 2014.9995, and k = 2014. The pattern suggests the final answer is approximately 2014.9995, approaching 2015 but less than it, aligning with the fractional part.
