This problem appears to involve finding a minimal number \( M \) (or some parameter related to sets of functions/flags) such that there's a certain combinatorial property involving subsets, their cardinalities, and constant assignments across functions defined on finite indices. The formal statement points to a minimal M satisfying a certain property, involving constraints on flags (functions \( Fin N \to Bool \)), subsets, and a uniform value \( c \).

Given the complexity, a reasonable approach is to test small values of \( M \) for fixed \( N \) (with \( N \ge 4 \)), enumerate candidate sets, and check the property. Since the problem asks for the least such \( M \), I'll set an upper bound and test increasing \( M \).

The key ingredients:
- \( N \ge 4 \)
- Flags: functions \( Fin N \to Bool \)
- For each \( M \), check if for any collection of flags of size \( M \), there's a subset \( s \) of flags (size \( N \)), contained in the original flags, with all functions in \( s \) agreeing on some \( c \).

Given the abstract nature, we'll test small \( N \) and small candidate \( M \) values, and print candidates as we go.

```python
# Enumerate possible M values for fixed N >= 4
def enumerate_candidates(N, max_M=20):
    # For each candidate M from 4 (minimum size for set) up to max_M
    for M in range(4, max_M + 1):
        # Generate all possible flags (functions from Fin N to Bool)
        # Since total number of functions is 2^N, generate all subsets of these
        all_flags = []
        total_flags = 2 ** N
        for mask in range(total_flags):
            flag = []
            for i in range(N):
                f_i = (mask >> i) & 1
                flag.append(bool(f_i))
            all_flags.append(flag)
        # Check if for any set of M flags, the property holds
        from itertools import combinations
        property_holds_for_all = True
        for flags_set in combinations(all_flags, M):
            # Check existence of subset s of size N within flags_set
            # with the property: s âŠ† flags_set, s.size = N, and exists c in Bool s,
            # s all have c at some coordinate
            # Instead of checking all subsets s of size N (could be large),
            # for small N, check all N-sized subsets of flags_set
            found = False
            for s in combinations(flags_set, N):
                # For each coordinate, check if all flags in s have the same value
                for c in [False, True]:
                    if all(f[i] == c for f in s for i in range(N)):
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if not found:
                # For this set of flags, property does not hold
                property_holds_for_all = False
                break
        if property_holds_for_all:
            # print candidate M as a potential answer
            print(f"Candidate M = {M} for N = {N}")
            # To match the original problem, likely minimal M; break after first
            return M
    # If no candidate found, return max_M
    print(f"No candidate M found up to {max_M} for N = {N}")
    return max_M

# Example usage for a small N:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    N = 4  # starting from minimum N as per problem statement
    result = enumerate_candidates(N)
```

This code enumerates possible values of \( M \), generating all flags for small \( N \), and checks the property described. It outputs candidates as they are found, prioritizing minimal \( M \), fulfilling the streaming partial results requirement.
