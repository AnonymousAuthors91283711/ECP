The problem involves sets S and T defined through ranges and digit constraints, with the key condition that for some t in T, 2^100 divides t. It seemingly focuses on understanding what numbers T includes, based on the digit conditions encoded by S, with T containing numbers whose digits are restricted to {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and divisible by 2^100.

To find all such t, our main approach is to:
- Generate numbers with digits from S, of a manageable length (since T depends on multiple digit positions).
- Filter those divisible by 2^100.
- Count and print all such numbers.

Given the constraints:
- S contains digits {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- T contains numbers with digits from S, with constraints on their length to ensure divisibility by 2^100.

For efficient enumeration, we'll generate numbers with a small number of digits, since large numbers would be computationally intensive. We can approximate the set of candidates by considering numbers up to a certain number of digits (e.g., 10 digits), which should include all relevant candidates for the divisibility condition.

Here's the Python code that:
- Prints each candidate immediately when found.
- Checks divisibility by 2^100.
- Limits generation to small digit length for efficiency.
- Summarizes the total count of such numbers.


```python
import itertools

# Digits permitted in T
digits = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

# Divisor: 2^100
divisor = 2 ** 100

# Limit number of digits to consider for enumeration
max_digits = 10

count = 0

for length in range(1, max_digits + 1):
    # Generate all numbers with 'length' digits, avoiding leading zeros
    for first_digit in digits[1:]:
        for remaining_digits in itertools.product(digits, repeat=length - 1):
            num_digits = (first_digit,) + remaining_digits
            t = 0
            for d in num_digits:
                t = t * 10 + d
            # Check divisibility by 2^100
            if t % divisor == 0:
                print(t)
                count += 1

print(f"Total numbers divisible by 2^100 with digits in {digits} up to length {max_digits}: {count}")
```
