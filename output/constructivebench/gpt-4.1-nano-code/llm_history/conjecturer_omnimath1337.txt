. Enumerated answers: Maximum k ≤ 2010 with S(k)=0: 0
S(0) = 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the definitions, S(0)=0 and S(k) sums i*a i over [1,k], with a i depending on whether S(i−1)<i, the sum alternates between adding and subtracting 1. Only at k=0 does S(k)=0, as the sum is empty. For any k≥1, the sum is nonzero due to alternating signs. Thus, the maximum k ≤ 2010 with S(k)=0 is 0.
