      ∀ r : ℤ, eval r (∑ i in Finset.range (n + 1), C (a i) * X^i) = 0 → r ∈ S) 
    ↔ S = IMO2019SLN3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Possible differences of powers of 2 for small exponents:
-6
-4
-2
2
4
6. Expected Answer Type: Set ℤ
Based on enumerated differences and the pattern of the values, the set consists of all integers that are even, covering all differences obtainable from powers of 2 (which are natural even differences). 

Therefore, the closed-form answer set is the set of all even integers:

<<<{z : ℤ | z % 2 = 0}>>>
