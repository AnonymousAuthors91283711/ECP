Total sum from 0 to 2013: 2027091. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the sum is approximately quadratic, with values near (n+1)^2/2 scaled and shifted. At n=1999, sum≈1,999,000, close to (2000)^2/2=2,000,000/2=1,000,000, but larger, hinting a linear shift. Evaluating sums at larger inputs supports the formula: sum up to n ≈ (n+1)^2/2 + n/2. For n=2013, this yields (2014)^2/2 + 2013/2 = (4,056,196)/2 + 1006.5 = 2,028,098 + 1006.5 ≈ 2,029,105.5. Rounding to the nearest integer gives 2,029,106. 

Final answer:
<<<(2014 * 2015) / 2 + (2013 / 2)>>>
