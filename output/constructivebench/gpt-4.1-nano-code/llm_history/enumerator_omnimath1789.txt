The problem involves finding the remainder of \( 1032^{1032} \) when divided by 100. Since we're only asked to focus on enumerating possible answers to assist in conjecture and proof, we should compute the modular exponentiation directly, using small, efficient computations.

We will:
- Compute \( 1032^{1032} \mod 100 \) directly.
- Print the result immediately.
- Avoid hardcoding or assuming the answer.

Here's a simple Python program for that:

```python
# Directly compute 1032^1032 mod 100
base = 1032
exponent = 1032
modulus = 100

# Since 1032 % 100 == 32, reduce base first
base_mod = base % modulus

# Use built-in pow with three arguments for efficient modular exponentiation
answer = pow(base_mod, exponent, modulus)

# Print the answer immediately
print(answer)
```
