. Enumerated Answers: 3/5. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The errors stem from the fact that `apples` and `bananas` are defined locally within the theorem, and cannot be directly referenced in the `abbrev`. To define `omnimath3406_answer` as a constant value of type `ℚ`, we need to express it as a fixed rational number, matching the known answer `3/5`. The most straightforward closed-form answer is simply the rational number `3/5`.

Furthermore, since `apples` and `bananas` are local variables, the answer should be independent of their specific values once the ratio is given. Given the current context, the correct answer to the ratio `(bananas) / (apples + bananas)` is `3/5`.

Thus, the corrected definition:

<<<3/5>>>

Explanation: The original goal is to find a constant rational number answer matching the ratio `(bananas) / (apples + bananas)` with `apples := 12`, `bananas := 15 + 3`. With `apples = 12`, `bananas = 18`, the ratio is `18 / (12 + 18) = 18/30 = 3/5`. So, the answer fixed as `3/5`. The errors are due to referencing local variables in a global `abbrev`; correcting this involves defining `omnimath3406_answer` as a fixed `ℚ`, namely `3/5`, which matches the enumerated answer.
