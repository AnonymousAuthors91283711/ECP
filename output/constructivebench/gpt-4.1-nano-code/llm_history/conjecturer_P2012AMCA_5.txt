theorem P2012AMCA_5 :
  ∃ (b r g c : ℕ),
    b + r + g + c = 280 ∧
    r = 2 * b ∧
    g = 3 * c ∧
    c = 4 * r ∧
    c = P2012AMCA_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: b=8, r=16, g=192, c=64
c value found: 64. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern and relations, c is expressed as 4 times r, with r being 2 times b, and g as 3 times c, all involving integer multiples. The enumeration suggests a consistent ratio chain leading to c = 64. The value c = 4 * r, with r = 2 * b, b can be derived from the total sum constraint.

Answer:
<<<(11 * 2^(2 + 2 + 1 + 0))>>>

But simplifying the powers:
b + r + g + c
= b + 2b + 3c + c
using c = 4r and r = 2b yields c = 8b, g = 3*8b = 24b.

Sum:
b + 2b + 24b + 8b = 35b = 280 => b = 8

then c = 8b = 64.

Final answer:
<<<64>>>
