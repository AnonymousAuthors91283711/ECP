This problem involves summing an arithmetic series and then determining a specific height at half the total time. We need to find an integer answer based on the problem's parameters. To assist conjecture and verify the answer, we will enumerate possible candidate values for the height and check the conditions implied by the sum.

Steps:
- Compute the total time as the sum of 10 * (k + 1) for k from 0 to 118.
- Find the half-time.
- Determine the index k where the accumulated sum first exceeds or equals half-time.
- Compute the corresponding height as 119 minus that index.
- Generate candidate heights and check for potential values flexible enough to capture the answer.
- Given the problem constraints, analyze candidate values close to the computed height.

```python
# The total time is the sum of 10*(k+1) from k=0 to 118
total_time = sum(10 * (k + 1) for k in range(119))
half_time = total_time / 2

# Compute cumulative sums to find the index where sum first exceeds half_time
cumulative = 0
index_at_half = 0
for k in range(119):
    cumulative += 10 * (k + 1)
    if cumulative >= half_time:
        index_at_half = k
        break

# The height at half_time
height_at_half_time = 119 - index_at_half
candidate_heights = [height_at_half_time]

# For completeness, consider neighboring heights for potential edge cases
if index_at_half > 0:
    candidate_heights.append(119 - (index_at_half - 1))
if index_at_half < 118:
    candidate_heights.append(119 - (index_at_half + 1))

# Print candidates to help conjecture the exact relationship
for h in candidate_heights:
    print(h)
```
