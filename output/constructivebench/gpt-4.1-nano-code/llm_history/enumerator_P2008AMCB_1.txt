This problem involves finding the set of all total values defined by the expression `total = 2*(5 - k) + 3*k` for `k` from 0 to 5. The goal is to enumerate all such totals, find their cardinality, and possibly determine a specific answer (e.g., min, max, or total count). 

Since the formula varies with `k` in a small range, we can iterate over `k` from 0 to 5, compute each `total`, and collect the results. Because the problem asks for the set being finite and its cardinality, we will enumerate all these totals and output the set and its size.

```python
# We will generate all total values for k from 0 to 5 using the given formula
results = set()
for k in range(6):
    total = 2 * (5 - k) + 3 * k
    print(f"k={k}, total={total}")
    results.add(total)

# Display the set of totals
print("Total set:", results)
print("Cardinality:", len(results))
```
This code enumerates all totals, prints each one as it is computed, and displays the final set and its count, aiding in conjecture and proof.
