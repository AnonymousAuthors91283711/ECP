The inequality implies all factors are positive or all are negative; the absolute value's digit count depends on the magnitude of n's deviations from specific points. The minimal digit count occurs when the magnitudes are just above powers of 10, approaching 16. Hence, the answer is 16 for the minimal such digit count.
