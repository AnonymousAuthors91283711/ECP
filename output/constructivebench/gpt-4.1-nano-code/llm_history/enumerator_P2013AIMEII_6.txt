This problem asks for the least natural number \( N \) such that for all integers \( k \), the square \( k^2 \) does not fall within the interval \([1000N, 1000N + 999]\). Equivalently, \( N \) is minimal so that there is no integer \( k \) with \( k^2 \) in that interval, which is of length 1000.

Our approach:
- For increasing \( N \), check whether any \( k \) exists satisfying:
  \[ 1000N \leq k^2 \leq 1000N + 999 \]
- Find the smallest \( N \) with no such \( k \).

Because \( k^2 \) values grow quickly, instead of iterating over all \( k \) for each \( N \), we can estimate bounds:
- The minimal \( k \) satisfying \( k^2 \geq 1000N \) is roughly \(\lceil \sqrt{1000N} \rceil\).
- The maximal \( k \) satisfying \( k^2 \leq 1000N + 999 \) is roughly \(\lfloor \sqrt{1000N + 999} \rfloor\).

We search for an \( N \) starting from 1, checking if any \( k \) in this approximate range satisfies the condition.

```python
import math

def check_interval(N):
    lower_bound = 1000 * N
    upper_bound = 1000 * N + 999
    min_k = math.ceil(math.sqrt(lower_bound))
    max_k = math.floor(math.sqrt(upper_bound))
    for k in range(min_k, max_k + 1):
        if k**2 >= lower_bound and k**2 <= upper_bound:
            return True  # There's an integer square in the interval
    return False  # No integer square in the interval for this N

N = 1
while True:
    if not check_interval(N):
        print(N)
        break
    N += 1
```

This code searches from \( N=1 \) upwards, printing the first \( N \) where no squares exist in the specified interval. It efficiently narrows the range of \( k \) based on the square root bounds, ensuring minimal unnecessary computations.
