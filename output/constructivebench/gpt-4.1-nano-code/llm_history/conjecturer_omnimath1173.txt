It appears the problem involves identifying positive integers x, y, and their relations to perfect squares and cubes. Given constraints, the pattern suggests x and y are small positive integers satisfying these identities, potentially (x, y) = (1, 1). This fits most of the conditions: sum, sum of squares, and sum of cubes being perfect squares.

Final Lean expression:

<<<(1, 1)>>>
