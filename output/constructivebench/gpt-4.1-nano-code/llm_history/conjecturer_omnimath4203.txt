Enumerating for m=4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Based on observed pattern, the sequence x_i behaves as powers of 2 for i < m, then becomes a sum of previous terms from i - (m - 1) to i. For i ≥ m, x_i resembles a sum over a sliding window of size m, which sums to 2^{i} in total. The maximum consecutive block with divisibility by m thus aligns with the sum of a geometric series, resulting in the final value being 2^{m}.
