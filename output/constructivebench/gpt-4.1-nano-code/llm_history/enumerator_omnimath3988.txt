This problem involves solving a functional equation:

\[ \forall m,n \in \mathbb{Z},\quad f(f(m)+n) + f(m) = f(n) + f(3m) + 2014 \]

since it is challenging to reason about all functions \(f:\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}\) directly, we attempt to find candidate solutions by exploring particular values and simplified assumptions, such as linearity. 

The approach:
- Assume \(f\) is linear: \(f(n) = a n + b\), and test for \(a,b\) that satisfy the functional equation.
- Enumerate small integer values for \(a\) and \(b\) within bounds to verify if the assumption holds.
- For each candidate, verify if the equation holds for some small tested pairs, and then output those solutions.

This enumeration helps conjecture the solution set. The code will generate potential linear solutions and verify them.

```python
# Enumerate small integer coefficients a and b to find solutions to the linear form
solutions = []

for a in range(-10, 11):
    for b in range(-10, 11):
        # Define the candidate function
        def f(n):
            return a * n + b

        # Check the functional equation for a few test pairs
        # Test with m, n in small range
        valid = True
        for m in range(-3, 4):
            for n in range(-3, 4):
                lhs = f(f(m) + n) + f(m)
                rhs = f(n) + f(3*m) + 2014
                if lhs != rhs:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break

        if valid:
            # Store the candidate solution
            solutions.append(f"{a}*n + {b}")

# Stream output: print all candidate solutions discovered
for sol in solutions:
    print(f"f(n) = {sol}")
```

This script tests linear solutions with small coefficients, enabling efficient enumeration and helping identify functions satisfying the given functional equation.
[refine_program]
The provided code systematically searches for linear functions \(f(n) = a n + b\) with small integer coefficients (from -10 to 10) that satisfy the functional equation for a small sample of integers \(m, n \in [-3, 3]\). It reports solutions only if the equation holds for all tested pairs. The implementation, however, failed to find any solutions, resulting in no output.

**Judgement:**
- The problem as stated involves a nonlinear functional equation, and restricting the check to small samples may miss solutions. 
- Moreover, the functional equation involves \(f(f(m) + n) + f(m) = f(n) + f(3m) + 2014\), which isn't necessarily satisfied by linear functions, especially with small coefficient ranges.
- The code's approach is only testing very limited sample points and does not guarantee solutions generally. 
- The code is correct in methodology but may be too restrictive or incomplete, leading to no solutions found, which does not fully represent the problem's intended solutions.
- Since the code outputs nothing and the problem expects solutions, the program "outputs empty result," which indicates either no solutions with the sampled parameters or that the solution set is more complex.

**Acceptance decision:**
The requirements specify that the program should explore the space properly and produce the entire answer set. Given the method, the approach is to check a small range, which is acceptable for a quick enumeration, but the sample range might be too narrow to find solutions if they exist outside. Since it outputs nothing, and solutions may exist with different coefficients, the current program doesn't satisfy the problem demands.

**Conclusion:**
The code is too limited and fails to find solutions in the tested range; therefore, it should be rejected. It does not properly enumerate solutions to the functional equation.

**Corrected Program:**
- Expand the coefficient range to include larger values to increase chances of finding solutions.
- Increase sampling of \((m, n)\) points.
- If solutions are linear functions \(f(n) = a n + b\), check for larger ranges or directly solve the equations algebraically. For the purposes of enumeration, just extend the search.

```python
# Enumerate small integer coefficients a and b with extended range to find solutions
solutions = []

# Broader search space
for a in range(-20, 21):
    for b in range(-20, 21):
        def f(n):
            return
[refine_program]
The original program contains only placeholder 'sorry' statements and lacks an actual implementation to enumerate solutions. Moreover, the problem involves a functional equation over integers: for all integers m, n, f satisfies  
f(f(m)+n) + f(m) = f(n) + f(3m) + 2014.

Since no code to find solutions is provided, and the enumeration yields an error, the output cannot be accepted as it stands. To meet the problem requirements, I will write an explicit program that enumerates candidate functions based on plausible assumptions, constraints, and small sample parameterization. Given the nature of the functional equation, typical solutions are linear functions of the form f(x) = ax + b.

Assuming linear solutions, and to keep the enumeration feasible, I will test small integer parameters for 'a' and 'b' within a modest range. I will print each candidate function when it satisfies the functional equation for some small sample values. After enumerating candidates, I will also print the candidate that seems to satisfy the equation best, specifically the linear functions within the parameter bounds.

Below is a corrected, streamlined, and efficient enumerator that:

- Assumes linear functions f(x) = a * x + b for small integer a, b.
- Checks the functional equation for a small set of test values.
- Prints each candidate if it satisfies the equation on the test values.
- Prioritizes exact matches over approximations.
- Does not hardcode solutions, and outputs all acceptable candidates under the bounds.

This approach aligns with the requirements, runs independently, and is concise.

---

**Explanation:**

The original program is empty and yields no answers, so it is rejected. The functional equation suggests linear solutions; thus, testing small parameters for 'a' and 'b' is a practical approach. The code enumerates candidate functions and checks them against sample inputs, printing those that satisfy the equation. This method respects the instructions and ensures the output is within token limits.

**Final assessment:** <<<False>>>

```python
# Enumerate linear functions f(x) = a * x + b for small integer a, b.
# Check the functional equation for small sample values.
# Print functions that satisfy the equation exactly on the samples.

def check_function(a, b, m_values, n_values):
    for m in m_values:
        for n in n_values:
            # Evaluate both sides
            left = (a * (a * m
