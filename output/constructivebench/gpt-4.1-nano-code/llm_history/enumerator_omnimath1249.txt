The problem involves finding the minimal real value of the expression |z₁z₂ + z₃z₄| where the z_i are roots of a specified quartic polynomial. Since roots are permuted, and the polynomial is given explicitly, we can compute all roots, then test all permutations of their assignments to find the minimal value of the expression. We then output all the candidate results, prioritizing exact (or rational) values, and ensure the code is efficient for small polynomials.

We'll:
- Find roots of the polynomial
- Generate all permutations of roots
- Compute the expression for each permutation
- Print all results immediately as we discover them
- Finally, find and print the minimum value found

Since roots can be complex, and their expressions might be irrational, we'll print both exact approximations and, where possible, rational forms for small integers.

```python
import numpy as np
from itertools import permutations

# Polynomial coefficients
coeffs = [1, 14, 52, 56, 16]  # x^4 + 14x^3 + 52x^2 + 56x + 16

# Find roots numerically
roots = np.roots(coeffs)
roots_list = list(roots)

# Convert roots to complex for clarity
roots_complex = [complex(r) for r in roots_list]

min_value = None

# Generate all permutations of roots
for perm in permutations(roots_complex):
    # Compute |z₁z₂ + z₃z₄|
    val = abs(perm[0]*perm[1] + perm[2]*perm[3])
    print(f"Permutation: {[str(r) for r in perm]}, Value: {val}")
    if (min_value is None) or (val < min_value):
        min_value = val

print(f"Minimal value found: {min_value}")
```
