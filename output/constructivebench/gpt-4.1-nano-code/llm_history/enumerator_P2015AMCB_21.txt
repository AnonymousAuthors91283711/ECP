The problem involves finding all positive integers n less than 1000 where the difference between cozy_jumps(n) and dash_jumps(n) equals 19, then summing these n and summing the digits of that sum. To assist, I'll enumerate candidate values explicitly, compute the difference, filter, and sum accordingly.

I will:
- Generate n âˆˆ [1..999],
- Compute cozy_jumps(n) and dash_jumps(n),
- Filter where their difference is 19,
- Sum all such n, and
- Sum digits of this total.

Since the exact answer is unknown, I'll print all candidates and the sum.

```python
# Enumerate n in [1..999], compute the difference, collect candidates
candidates = []
for n in range(1, 1000):
    def cozy_jumps(steps):
        return steps // 2 if steps % 2 == 0 else (steps // 2) + 1
    def dash_jumps(steps):
        return steps // 5 if steps % 5 == 0 else (steps // 5) + 1
    if cozy_jumps(n) - dash_jumps(n) == 19:
        print(f"Candidate n: {n}")
        candidates.append(n)

# Sum all candidate n
total_sum = sum(candidates)
print(f"Sum of all candidates: {total_sum}")

# Sum of digits of total_sum
digits_sum = sum(int(d) for d in str(total_sum))
print(f"Sum of digits of total sum: {digits_sum}")
```
