The problem involves finding the exact value of \( 3^{127} + 2^{127} \). Since these are large exponentiations, we can compute them directly in Python, then verify the sum.

Hereâ€™s the program to compute and enumerate the exact value:

```python
# Compute the large powers directly
power_3_127 = 3 ** 127
power_2_127 = 2 ** 127

# Sum of the two large numbers
answer = power_3_127 + power_2_127

# Print the answer immediately
print(answer)
```

This script calculates the exact value of \( 3^{127} + 2^{127} \) and outputs it immediately when run.
