The sequence appears to relate to an arithmetic progression starting from a1=5, with a common difference d, and the equation balances the sums of squares at specified terms. Solving for d yields the pattern where the sequence continues with 5, 7, 9, ... i.e., all odd integers starting from 5. Therefore, the set of all such a5 values is {5, 7, 9, 11, ...}, which can be expressed as 5 + 2ℤ positive.
