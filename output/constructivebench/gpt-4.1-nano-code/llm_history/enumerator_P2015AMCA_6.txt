The problem involves finding the least natural number \( n \) such that there exist non-negative integers \( P, C \) satisfying the three equations simultaneously:

1. \( P - 2 = 3 \times (C - 2) \)
2. \( P - 4 = 4 \times (C - 4) \)
3. \( P + n = 2 \times (C + n) \)

We are to find the minimal \( n \) for which these conditions hold, and the theorem states that this \( n \) is the least such \( n \) where there exists some \( P, C \) satisfying the equations, and it claims to provide that minimal \( n \).

Because it's a small number problem, we can try small \( P, C \) values that satisfy the first two equations and check the third condition to find possible \( n \), then find the minimal.

Let's code accordingly:

```python
# Enumerate small P, C to find solutions satisfying equations 1 and 2
# and then check for the minimal n satisfying the third.

min_n = None
answer_n = None

# We choose small bounds for P, C
for P in range(0, 50):
    for C in range(0, 50):
        # Check equations 1 and 2
        if P - 2 == 3 * (C - 2) and P - 4 == 4 * (C - 4):
            # For these P, C, find all n such that equation 3 holds
            # (P + n) = 2 * (C + n)
            # => P + n = 2C + 2n
            # => P - 2C = n
            n = P - 2 * C
            # For n >= 0 (assuming natural number n), record minimal
            if n >= 0:
                # Update minimal n
                if min_n is None or n < min_n:
                    min_n = n
                    answer_n = n
                print(f"Found solution: P={P}, C={C}, n={n}")
print(f"The minimal n is {answer_n}")
```
