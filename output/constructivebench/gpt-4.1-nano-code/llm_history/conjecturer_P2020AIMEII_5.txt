Since the digits (in base 16 or 10) are involved with the sums of digits of n and 8 times that sum, and the predicate involves digits ≥ 10 (i.e., a digit in base 16 ≥ 10), the minimal n satisfying this appears when n = 5: digit sum of 4s is 4, g(n)= (digits 8 4)= (digits 8 4) sum = 8 + 4=12 ≥ 10. No smaller positive n has such a large digit sum after transformation. 

Thus, the minimal such n is 5.
