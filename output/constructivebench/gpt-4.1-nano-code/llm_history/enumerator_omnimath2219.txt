This problem involves a set S of integers with specific properties related to differences and sums, and the goal is to find the maximum size k of such a set satisfying the property P. 

Since the condition involves arbitrary subsets of integers within an interval [1, 2015], and a property about differences and sums, we should examine small examples to understand the constraints. The key restriction is: for any distinct \(a, b \in S\), \(a \neq b\), it should NOT be true that \(a - b\) divides \(a + b\).

---

Plan:
- Consider subsets S of [1, 2015] with small sizes.
- For feasibility, start with small sets, e.g., size 1, then 2, etc.
- For each candidate size, generate candidate sets and check the condition.
- Record the maximum size k.

Given the problem's combinatorial nature, a brute-force search over all sets is infeasible, but we can attempt a greedy approach:
- Start from 1-element sets.
- Try adding numbers from the interval [1, 2015], ensuring the condition holds.
- Keep track of the largest found.

Since we can't compute the entire search here, we'll implement a simplified enumeration approach, testing a carefully chosen subset pattern, e.g., consecutive numbers, well-spaced numbers, etc.

```python
# We aim to find the maximum size of a subset S within [1, 2015]
# such that for any two distinct elements a, b in S,
# the divisor condition is not satisfied: (a - b) divides (a + b).

def check_condition(S):
    # Check all pairs (a, b), a != b
    for i in range(len(S)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(S)):
            a, b = S[i], S[j]
            diff = abs(a - b)
            total = a + b
            # If difference divides total, condition fails
            if total % diff == 0:
                return False
    return True

max_size = 0
max_set = []

# To keep the computation feasible, we test structured sets:
# e.g., evenly spaced numbers starting from 1
for step in range(1, 50):  # small steps
    S = list(range(1, 2016, step))
    if check_condition(S):
        size = len(S)
        print(f"Found size {size} with step {step}")
        if size > max_size:
            max_size = size
            max_set = S

# Also check the first few integers (dense sets)
for size in range(1, 50):
    S = list(range(1, size + 1))
    if check_condition(S):
        print(f"Set of size {size}: {S}")

# Output the maximum size found
print(f"Maximum size found: {max_size}")
print(f"Corresponding set (sample): {max_set}")
```
