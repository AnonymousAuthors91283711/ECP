. Enumerated answers: k=0: v_2(3^(2^0)) - 1) = 1
k=1: v_2(3^(2^1)) - 1) = 2
k=2: v_2(3^(2^2)) - 1) = 3
k=3: v_2(3^(2^3)) - 1) = 4
k=4: v_2(3^(2^4)) - 1) = 5
k=5: v_2(3^(2^5)) - 1) = 6
k=6: v_2(3^(2^6)) - 1) = 7
k=7: v_2(3^(2^7)) - 1) = 8
k=8: v_2(3^(2^8)) - 1) = 9
k=9: v_2(3^(2^9)) - 1) = 10
Maximum n: 10. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern shows that the maximum n is 2^{k+1} for the largest k satisfying v_2(3^{2^k} - 1) = k + 1, based on the 2-adic valuation.  
Thus, answer = 2^{(k+1)} = 2^{10} = 1024, which aligns with the enumerated maximum n = 10 when considering the exponent sum.  
Since the valuations increase by 1 each time, the greatest n is 2^{10} = 1024.  
Answer:
<<<2^10>>>
