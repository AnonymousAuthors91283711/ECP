This appears to be a problem involving number theory, specifically modular congruences, and requires us to find the least natural number \( n \) satisfying certain conditions. The problem states:

Find the least \( n \) such that:
- there exists some \( k \) with \( 7 \cdot n \equiv 0 \pmod{52} \),
- and \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \).

Let's analyze the conditions:
- \( 7 \cdot n \equiv 0 \pmod{52} \) implies \( 52 \mid 7 \cdot n \).
- \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \) (i.e., \( n \) is even).

Factor 52: \( 52 = 4 \times 13 \). Since \( 7 \) is coprime with 52 (gcd 1), the divisibility \( 52 \mid 7 \cdot n \) simplifies to \( 52 \mid n \), because gcd(\(7, 52\)) = 1, so \( 52 \mid 7 n \Rightarrow 52 \mid n \).

Given that \( n \) is divisible by 52, and \( n \) is even, these are compatible because 52 is even.

Therefore, the minimal such \( n \) that satisfies \( 52 \mid n \) and \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \) is simply \( n = 52 \).

Now, to verify if the minimal \( n \) is indeed 52, we can confirm:

- \( n=52 \implies 7 \cdot 52 = 364 \), and \( 364 \mod 52 = 0 \). So \( 7 \cdot 52 \equiv 0 \pmod{52} \).
- \( 52 \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \): yes.

Any smaller multiple of 52 (like 26) doesn't satisfy the divisibility, but 52 is minimal.

Let's write a Python script that enumerates candidates to verify this.

```python
# Enumerate multiples of 52 that are even and check the conditions.
max_n = 200  # limit for enumeration
answers = []

for n in range(0, max_n + 1, 2):  # step by 2 to ensure n is even
    if 52 % n == 0 if n != 0 else False:  # check if 52 divides n
        # check if 7 * n divisible by 52
        if (7 * n) % 52 == 0:
            print(n)
            answers.append(n)
            # since we're enumerating in ascending order, first matches minimum
            break
```

This script enumerates even candidates up to 200, finds the smallest \( n \) satisfying the conditions, and prints it as soon as found.

The minimal candidate satisfying the conditions is 52.

```python
# Full code ready for execution:
```python
max_n = 200
for n in range(0, max_n + 1, 2):
    if n != 0 and 52 % n == 0 and (7 * n) % 52 == 0:
        print(n)
        break
```
