The problem appears to relate to a coloring of a (4*m) x (4*m) grid, with certain conditions on the blue cells. The goal is to find the least number of blue cells `k` such that, for some coloring, every blue cell has at least two blue neighbors (in the same row or column), and no two blue cells are identical. 

Given the complexity, a common approach is to perform an enumeration for small values of `m`. For each `m`, we can generate candidate colorings with various numbers of blue cells, checking the critical conditions to find the minimal `k`.

Due to combinatorial explosion, we'll choose small `m` (say, 1, 2, 3) and search for minimal `k`. For each `m`, we generate all possible blue cell placements with a bounded number of blue cells.

Here's my plan:
- Fix small `m` (say 1 or 2).
- For each candidate number of blue cells `k` (from 1 up to a limit), enumerate all subsets of the grid with size `k`.
- For each subset, check if each blue cell has at least two blue neighbors sharing row or column.
- Keep track of the minimal `k` satisfying these conditions.
- Print each candidate `k` as found for each `m`.

This approach prioritizes the enumeration and immediate output of each candidate, and stops when the minimal `k` for each `m` is found.

```python
import itertools

def check_blue_cells(blue_cells, m):
    """
    Check if for each blue cell, there are at least two blue neighbors sharing its row or column.
    """
    grid_size = 4 * m
    for cell in blue_cells:
        row, col = cell
        neighbors = [c for c in blue_cells if (c[0] == row or c[1] == col) and c != cell]
        if len(neighbors) < 2:
            return False
    return True

for m in range(1, 4):  # Small sample sizes for m
    grid_points = [(r, c) for r in range(4 * m) for c in range(4 * m)]
    found_min_k = None
    for k in range(1, 2 * m + 1):  # Limit max blue cells
        for blue_subset in itertools.combinations(grid_points, k):
            blue_cells = list(blue_subset)
            if check_blue_cells(blue_cells, m):
                print(f"m={m}, minimal blue cells k={k}")
                found_min_k = k
                break
        if found_min_k is not None:
            break
```
