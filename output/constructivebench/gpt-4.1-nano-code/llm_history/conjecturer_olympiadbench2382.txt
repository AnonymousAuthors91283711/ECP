. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The pattern suggests counting triplets with fixed sums, and the counts match combinations with constraints. Observing the counts 2, 4, 3 for n=10,11,12 respectively, a pattern emerges: the total triplets correspond to summations over certain ranges. For these specific n values, the total is roughly proportional to \(\lfloor \frac{n-1}{2} \rfloor\) or related functions. Noticing the specific triplet counts, the formula resembles counting pairs where the sum divides into parts satisfying the inequalities. A plausible closed form for general n is (n-2).
