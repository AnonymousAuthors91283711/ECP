Total number of divisors: 4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the divisors and their pattern, the relevant divisors of 111 with gcd constraints are 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 35, 105. The total count of these divisors is 7, most notably including the multiplicative factors that divide 111 and satisfy the gcd condition. Among the enumerations, the divisor 105 is the largest relevant and matches pattern considerations.

Hence, the total number of divisors is 7. Since the problem asks for a single answer reflecting this count, the final answer is 7.

<<<7>>>

This matches the enumeration and logical deduction based on the divisors of 111 satisfying the specific gcd conditions.
