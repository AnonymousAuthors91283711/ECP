This problem involves solving an exponential equation and evaluating an expression based on the solution. The key equation is \( 2^x = 16 \). Since \( 16 = 2^4 \), the solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \). 

Next, the theorem asks for the value of \( 2^{x+3} \) with \( x = 4 \). Substituting, we get \( 2^{4+3} = 2^7 \), which equals 128. To verify no ambiguity, the enumeration explicitly checks the solving step and computes the value precisely.

```python
# Enumerate small values near the solution to confirm the equation
# Solve 2^x = 16 -> x = 4
x_values = [3, 4, 5]

for x in x_values:
    if 2 ** x == 16:
        # Found the exact solution
        solution_x = x
        print(f'Solution x = {solution_x}')

# Compute 2^(x+3) at the solution
answer = 2 ** (solution_x + 3)
print(f'Answer: 2^{solution_x + 3} = {answer}')
```
