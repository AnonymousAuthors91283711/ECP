  IsGreatest {k : ℕ | ∃ (N : ℕ), 100 ≤ N ∧ N < 1000 ∧ 
    (∀ (a b : ℕ), a ∣ N → b ∣ N → a ≠ b → 3 ∣ (a - b)) ∧ 
    k = N * (Nat.divisors N).card} 
  omnimath778_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Maximum k: -1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern indicates the maximum value for k is when N is a perfect power of 3. Testing N = 27 (3^3), divisors are {1,3,9,27}, differences are multiples of 3, satisfying the conditions. k = 27 * 4 = 108. Larger N ≠ perfect 3-power, so maximum k is achieved at N=27.

<<<108>>>
