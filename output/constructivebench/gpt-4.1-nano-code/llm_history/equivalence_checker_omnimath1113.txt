abbrev omnimath1113_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath1113 :
  let dice := Fin 20
  let rolls := Fin 5 → dice
  let count20s (d : rolls) := (univ.filter (fun i => d i = 19)).card
  let total := (univ.filter (fun d : rolls => 3 ≤ count20s d)).card
  let success := (univ.filter (fun d : rolls => count20s d = 5)).card
  (success : ℚ) / (total : ℚ) = omnimath1113_answer := by sorry
