. Enumerated answers: f(5) = 7. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the functional equation `f(3x - 1) = x^2 + x + 1` and the value `f(5)`, we can find a specific `x` such that `3x - 1 = 5`, i.e., `x = 2`. Substituting `x=2` yields `f(5) = 2^2 + 2 + 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7`. 

<<<7>>>, as the direct substitution confirms the value.
