theorem omnimath1803 (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
  (∀ x y, f x + f y + 1 ≥ f (x + y) ∧ f (x + y) ≥ f x + f y) ∧
  (∀ x ∈ Set.Ico 0 1, f 0 ≥ f x) ∧
  f (-1) = -1 ∧ f 1 = 1 ↔
  f = omnimath1803_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
<<<fun x => if x ≤ 0 then -x else x>>>
