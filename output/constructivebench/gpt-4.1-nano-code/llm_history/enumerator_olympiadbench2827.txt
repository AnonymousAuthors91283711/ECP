This problem involves a high level of math reasoning, particularly dealing with powers of irrational numbers and their integer parts modulo 100. The key insight is recognizing the pattern for expressions like `(a + b)^n + (a - b)^n`, especially for specific algebraic conjugates.

The expression `(3 + √5)^34` is close to an integer because `(3 + √5)` and `(3 - √5)` are conjugates with special properties. We can find `(3 + √5)^n + (3 - √5)^n` is always an integer. Since `(3 - √5)` is less than 1, `(3 - √5)^34` becomes very small—approaching 0. Thus,

```
floor( (3 + √5)^34 ) ≈ (3 + √5)^34 + (3 - √5)^34 ) - 1
```
because `(3 - √5)^34` is positive but tiny.

We can compute `(3 + √5)^34 + (3 - √5)^34` exactly using binomial theorem or recursive formulas, but since this is a code to enumerate with small effort, an efficient approach is to use the recurrence relation:

Let `A_n = (3 + √5)^n + (3 - √5)^n`. Then, `A_n` satisfies a recurrence because both `(3 + √5)` and `(3 - √5)` are roots of `x^2 - 6x - 4 = 0`.

`A_0 = 2`, `A_1 = 6`, and for `n >= 2`:
```
A_n = 6 * A_{n-1} + 4 * A_{n-2}
```

calculating `A_34`, then the integer part of `(3 + √5)^34` is approximately `A_34 - 1` (since `(3 - √5)^34` is very small), and its modulo 100 can be calculated directly.

```python
# Enumeration and computation for (3 + √5)^34 modulo 100
# Use recurrence to compute A_n = (3+√5)^n + (3-√5)^n

A0 = 2
A1 = 6
n = 34

# Recurrence: A_n = 6 * A_{n-1} + 4 * A_{n-2}
for _ in range(2, n + 1):
    A0, A1 = A1, 6 * A1 + 4 * A0

A_34 = A1

# The value of floor((3+√5)^34) is approximately A_34 - (3 - √5)^34,
# but since (3 - √5)^34 is tiny, floor sum is A_34 - 1.
approx_int = A_34 - 1

# Compute answer: last two digits of approximate integer
answer = approx_int % 100

print(f"Answer (floor((3+√5)^34) mod 100): {answer}")
