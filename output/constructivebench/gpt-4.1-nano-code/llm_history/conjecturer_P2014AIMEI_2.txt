theorem P2014AIMEI_2 (N : ℕ) (hN : N > 0) :
  (4 * 16 + 6 * N) / (10 * (16 + N)) = 58/100 ↔ N = P2014AIMEI_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The given equation simplifies as  (64 + 6N)/(160 + 10N) = 58/100. Cross-multiplied, it becomes 100(64 + 6N) = 58(160 + 10N). Simplifying, 6400 + 600N = 9280 + 580N, leading to 20N = 2880, so N = 144.
