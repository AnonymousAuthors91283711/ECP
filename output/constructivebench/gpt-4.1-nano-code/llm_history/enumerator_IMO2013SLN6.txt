The problem appears to be a functional equation involving a function \(f : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Z}\), satisfying the symmetry condition \(f(f(x) + a / b) = f(-x + a / b)\) for all rationals \(x, a, b\) with \(b > 0\). The goal seems to be to determine all such functions \(f\).

Given the mathematical nature, to assist conjecturing the solutions, we'll generate candidate functions \(f\), particularly simple ones like constant functions or linear functions with small integer coefficients, to see which satisfy the condition. Since the input space is \(\mathbb{Q}\), and the functional equation involves symmetry, constant functions are the simplest candidates. We'll check constants systematically and try some linear functions with small integer slopes.

Our script will:
- Generate simple candidate functions \(f(x) = c\) or \(f(x) = m x + c\),
- Verify the functional equation for each,
- Stream solutions when they satisfy the condition.

This approach helps conjecture what form solutions may take.

```python
# Enumerate simple candidate functions: constant and linear with small coefficients
# Check the functional equation for each candidate
# Stream solutions when criteria are met

# Because the functional equation must hold for all rational x, a, b,
# testing for specific small values can suggest solutions.
