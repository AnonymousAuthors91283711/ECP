Total solutions: 31. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests n must divide x^13 - x for all positive x. Since n > 1, it likely relates to divisors of x^13 - x for all x, which are known to include primes dividing 13, and their combinations. The common divisors are products of prime divisors including 13 and 3, 5, 7, etc., especially those dividing certain values across the complex pattern. The enumerated solutions indicate a pattern linked to divisors of 13, 7, 5, and their combinations up to 2730. Given the pattern and the scaling, the generalized answer is the product of the key primes involved, i.e., 3 * 5 * 7 * 13 = 1365. Since the pattern includes other multiples, but the minimal consistent recurring divisor across all solutions based on the clues is 1365.
