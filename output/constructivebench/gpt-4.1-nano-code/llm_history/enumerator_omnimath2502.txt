The problem describes counting the number of finite sets of natural numbers less than 23, with no prime elements, whose sum is exactly 23. We need to enumerate all such sets to find the total count, which is the answer.

Steps:
- Generate all natural numbers less than 23, excluding primes.
- Enumerate all subsets of these non-prime numbers.
- Sum each subset and check if it sums to 23.
- Count all such subsets.

Since the problem asks for the number of such sets, the code will list all qualifying subsets and count them, printing each as it finds them. We will use small sample values and generate efficiently.

```python
# List of non-prime numbers less than 23
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Generate numbers less than 23, excluding primes
numbers = [n for n in range(2, 23) if not is_prime(n)]

# We will enumerate subsets using bit masks
count = 0
for mask in range(1 << len(numbers)):
    subset = [numbers[i] for i in range(len(numbers)) if (mask & (1 << i))]
    if sum(subset) == 23:
        print(set(subset))
        count += 1
print(f"Total sets: {count}")
```
