The problem appears to involve finding all natural numbers `n` between 10 and 20 such that there exists some `k` with `4k + 5k = n^2`, i.e., `9k = n^2`, and additionally `n^2` is divisible by 9. Simplifying, `n^2` must be divisible by 9, which implies `n` itself must be divisible by 3 (since 3 is prime). Within the range 11 to 19, the multiples of 3 are 12, 15, and 18. For each, check if `n^2` is divisible by 9 (which it will be if `n` is divisible by 3).

Now, we seek all `n` in the given interval satisfying these criteria and find corresponding `k`.

Here's a Python code to enumerate these candidates efficiently: 

- It will check each `n` from 11 to 19,
- verify divisibility,
- compute `k = n^2 / 9`,
- and output such `n`.

```python
# Enumerate n in the range (10, 20)
for n in range(11, 20):
    if n % 3 == 0:
        n_sq = n * n
        if n_sq % 9 == 0:
            k = n_sq // 9
            print(f"n = {n}, k = {k}")
```
