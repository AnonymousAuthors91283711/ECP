Let's analyze the problem.

The theorem involves a polynomial \( P \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) with roots \(\{1/4, 1/2, 2, 4\}\). The conditions specify:

- The roots are exactly \(\{1/4, 1/2, 2, 4\}\).
- The polynomial’s leading coefficient \( a \) satisfies \( a \times (1/4 \times 1/2 \times 2 \times 4) = 1 \).
- Evaluating \( P \) at 1 yields 1.
- The value \( \text{omnimath1556_answer} \) equals \( P(0) \).

In algebra, for monic polynomials with roots \(\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4\}\):

\( P(x) = (x - r_1)(x - r_2)(x - r_3)(x - r_4) \).

Since the polynomial may have a leading coefficient \( a \neq 1 \), the general form:

\( P(x) = a \times \prod_{i=1}^{4} (x - r_i) \).

The product of roots \( r_1 r_2 r_3 r_4 = (1/4) \times (1/2) \times 2 \times 4 \).

Calculating the product:

\[
(1/4) \times (1/2) \times 2 \times 4
= (1/4) \times (1/2) \times 2 \times 4
\]

Simplify step by step:

- \( (1/4) \times (1/2) = 1/8 \),
- \( 1/8 \times 2 = 1/4 \),
- \( 1/4 \times 4 = 1 \).

Thus, the product of roots is 1. The condition:

\( a \times 1 = 1 \Rightarrow a = 1 \).

So \( P(x) \) is monic with roots \(\{1/4, 1/2, 2, 4\}\). Then:

\[
P(x) = (x - 1/4)(x - 1/2)(x - 2)(x - 4).
\]

We need to compute \( P(0) \):

\[
P(0) = \prod_{i=1}^{4} (-r_i) = (-1)^4 \times r_1 r_2 r_3 r_4 = 1 \times 1 = 1.
\]

Also, verify \( P(1) \):

\[
P(1) = (1 - 1/4)(1 - 1/2)(1 - 2)(1 - 4) = (3/4)(1/2)(-1)(-3) = (0.75)(0.5)(-1)(-3).
\]

Compute step by step:

- \( 0.75 \times 0.5 = 0.375 \),
- \( 0.375 \times (-1) = -0.375 \),
- \( -0.375 \times (-3) = 1.125 \).

So \( P(1) = 1.125 \neq 1 \).

But the problem states \( \text{eval } 1 P = 1 \). Since this is not matching, perhaps the polynomial is scaled by a coefficient \( a \neq 1 \). But earlier, we concluded \( a=1 \) from the product of roots condition. 

Noticing that if \( P(x) \) had a leading coefficient \( a \neq 1 \), then the roots are the same, but the polynomial at 1 would scale accordingly:

\[
P(1) = a \times \prod_{i=1}^4 (1 - r_i) = a \times 1.125.
\]

Given \( P(1) = 1 \), then

\[
a \times 1.125 = 1 \Rightarrow a = \frac{1}{1.125} = \frac{8}{9}.
\]

Similarly, check the product \( P(0) \):

\[
P(0) = a \times \prod_{i=1}^{4} (-r_i) = a \times 1 = \frac{8}{9}.
\]

Thus, \( P(0) = \frac{8}{9} \).

Now, since \( P(x) = a \prod_{i=1}^4 (x - r_i) \) with roots \( r_i \), leading coefficient \( a = \frac{8}{9} \), roots \( r_i \), and quadratic coefficient determined accordingly.

In code, we'll generate \( P(x) \) as:

\[
P(x) = \frac{8}{9} \times (x - 1/4)(x - 1/2)(x - 2)(x - 4),
\]

then evaluate \( P(0) \).

Let's do an enumeration of all such possible polynomials with the given roots, scaled by different coefficients that satisfy the conditions \( P(1) = 1 \). The key insight is the scale \( a = \frac{8}{9} \). But the problem possibly hints at exploring all such possible polynomials.

Given the problem’s constraints, for simplicity, we only need to generate the polynomial with roots and the relevant parameters, then compute \( P(0) \).

Here's the code to do this:

```python
# Enumerate the polynomial with specified roots and scale to satisfy P(1) = 1
from itertools import product

# Roots as given
roots = [1/4, 1/2, 2, 4]

# Compute the product of roots
prod_roots = 1/4 * 1/2 * 2 * 4  # equals 1

# The polynomial's leading coefficient 'a' is determined by P(1) = 1
# P(1) = a * product_{i} (1 - r_i)
# So, a = 1 / product_{i} (1 - r_i)

product_at_1 = 1
for r in roots:
    product_at_1 *= (1 - r)

# Calculate 'a'
a = 1 / product_at_1

# Polynomial: P(x) = a * (x - r1)(x - r2)(x - r3)(x - r4)
# P(0) = a * ∏(-r_i)

product_at_0 = 1
for r in roots:
    product_at_0 *= -r

P0 = a * product_at_0

print("Selected root set:", roots)
print("Coefficient a:", a)
print("P(0):", P0)
# P(0) value

# Verify P(1) to ensure correctness
P1 = a * 1.125  # from previous calculation
print("P(1):", P1)
```

This code assumes roots are fixed as given, computes the coefficient \( a \) to satisfy the evaluation at 1, then computes \( P(0) \).

In conclusion, the key value is \( P(0) = \frac{8}{9} \).
