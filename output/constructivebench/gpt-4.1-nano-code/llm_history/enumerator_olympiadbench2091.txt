The problem appears to be about finding the maximal value of N (the number of triples) with certain constraints. Specifically, for the given n â‰¥ 2, we are looking for the largest N such that there exist triples `(a, (b, c))` with the properties:
- `a + b + c = n`
- All `a`s are distinct
- All `b`s are distinct
- All `c`s are distinct

The goal is to find the greatest N for which such a set of triples exists.

Given the symmetry and the constraints, the maximum N is limited by the number of distinct triples with sum n, where the triples are formed from sets of unique values for each component, ensuring all `a`s, `b`s, and `c`s are distinct.

To approximate and initiate exploration, the code will:
- Pick small n (say, 4 to 10).
- Generate triples with `a + b + c = n`.
- Ensure distinct `a`-, `b`-, and `c`-values.
- Count how many such triples can be formed.

The code will:
- Enumerate possible triples.
- Check the distinctness conditions.
- Track the maximum N for each n.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate triples with sum n, ensuring each component is unique within the sets
def enumerate_triples(n):
    triples_list = []
    for a in range(1, n-1):
        for b in range(1, n - a):
            c = n - a - b
            if c > 0:
                triples_list.append((a, (b, c)))
    # Count the maximum number of triples with pairwise distinct components
    max_N = 0
    for subset_size in range(1, len(triples_list) + 1):
        from itertools import combinations
        for subset in combinations(triples_list, subset_size):
            a_set = {t[0] for t in subset}
            b_set = {t[1][0] for t in subset}
            c_set = {t[1][1] for t in subset}
            if len(a_set) == len(b_set) == len(c_set) == subset_size:
                if subset_size > max_N:
                    max_N = subset_size
                    print(f"n = {n}, max triples = {max_N}")
    return max_N

# Test small values of n
for n in range(4, 11):
    enumerate_triples(n)
```
