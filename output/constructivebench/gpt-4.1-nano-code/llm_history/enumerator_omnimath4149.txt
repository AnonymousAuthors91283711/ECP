[write_program]
This problem appears to involve designing a strategy for identifying a secret 3-tuple `(x,y,z)` with constraints `0 ≤ x,y,z ≤ 9` using responses that measure differences based on guesses. The goal is to find the minimal `n` such that any secret can be distinguished from all others within the set `T` using `n` guesses.

Since the problem asks to "enumerate possible answers" to help conjecture the minimal `n`, and the constraints are small (each coordinate between 0 and 9), we can perform a brute-force search over small `n`. We'll test for the minimal number `n` for which a strategy exists that can distinguish all secrets from others.

Approach:
- For each candidate `n` starting from 1 upwards:
  - Generate all possible strategies (finite functions from `Fin n` to guesses in `T`).
  - For each strategy, check whether it distinguishes all secrets from each other.
- Immediately output when a valid strategy is found for a given `n`.

To keep the program efficient, we'll:
- Limit ourselves to small `n` (say up to 4).
- Use a brute-force approach with pruning.
- Enumerate strategies contents explicitly.

Note: Since the problem is conceptual and the direct coded example in the formal language looks complex, this Python code will be a simplified enumeration that outputs possible minimal `n`s along with some strategies (if found).

```python
from itertools import product, permutations, combinations
import sys

# Set of all possible secrets: x,y,z in [0,9]
T = [(x,y,z) for x in range(10) for y in range(10) for z in range(10)]

def response(secret, guess):
    x,y,z = secret
    a,b,c = guess
    return abs(x + y - (a + b)) + abs(y + z - (b + c)) + abs(z + x - (c + a))

# Check if a strategy distinguishes all secrets
def strategy_distinguishes(strategy, secrets):
    for s1 in secrets:
        for s2 in secrets:
            if s1 != s2:
                i_found = False
                for i, guess in enumerate(strategy):
                    if response(s1, guess) != response(s2, guess):
                        i_found = True
                        break
                if not i_found:
                    return False
    return True

# Try to find minimal n
max_n = 4  # limit for efficiency
for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    # Generate all strategies: sequences of length n with guesses in T
    strategies = product(T, repeat=n)
    for strat in strategies:
        strat_list = list(strat)
        if strategy_distinguishes(strat_list, T):
            # Print immediately when found
            print(f"Minimal n: {n}")
            print(f"Strategy (index to guess): {list(enumerate(strat_list))}")
            sys.exit(0)

print("No strategy found within n <= 4")
```
