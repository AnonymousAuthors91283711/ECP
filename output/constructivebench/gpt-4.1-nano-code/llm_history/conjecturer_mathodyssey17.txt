abbrev mathodyssey17_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem mathodyssey17 :
    IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (n ^ 3 % 1000 = 888)} mathodyssey17_answer :=

1692
1942
Least n: 192. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern, the sequence starts at 192 and increases by 250 to find the next candidate. Since the problem asks for the least n satisfying the condition, the answer is 192, matching the enumerated least value.  
Answer: <<<192>>>
