19. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern indicates that for each m, there's a constructible sequence with specific properties, and the set of such m's appears to include all integers greater than 1, except possibly some specific residues.

Based on common modular properties and to satisfy the condition that (a 2 - a 1) % m ≠ 0, while still allowing a sequence where (a n - g n) is divisible by m for all n, the minimal values are m ≥ 2, excluding m=1.

Given the enumerated list, the set likely includes all integers m ≥ 2.

Hence, the answer in Lean is the set of all natural numbers ≥ 2:

<<<{m : ℕ | 2 ≤ m}>>>
