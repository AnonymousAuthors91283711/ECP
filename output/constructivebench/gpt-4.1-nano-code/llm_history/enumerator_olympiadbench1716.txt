The problem involves finding the greatest possible value of the sum \( S = \sum_{i=0}^{99} x_i x_{i+2} \) under the constraints that each \( x_i \geq 0 \) and for each \( i \), \( x_i + x_{i+1} + x_{i+2} \leq 1 \), with indices modulo 100. By exploring the structure, the maximum likely occurs when the \( x_i \) are at their highest possible values while satisfying the sum constraints, and the pattern repeating periodically.

To approximate these solutions, we'll consider a simple uniform pattern for variables, note the maximum total sum, and then check for different patterns to conjecture the maximum.

```python
# Program to estimate the maximum possible value of the sum S under given constraints
# Choose small pattern parameters to explore feasible solutions and approximate the maximum

# Constraints:
# x_i >= 0 for all i in 0..99
# For each i: x_i + x_{i+1} + x_{i+2} <= 1

# Approach:
# - Consider uniform solutions where x_i = c for all i
#   then for each i: 3c <= 1 => c <= 1/3
#   sum S = sum of x_i x_{i+2} = 100 * c^2 (since all x_i = c)
#   max at c = 1/3, sum S ≈ 100 * (1/3)^2 ≈ 100/9 ≈ 11.111...
# - Explore alternating patterns (e.g., x_i = a for even i, x_i = b for odd i)
#   with constraints:
#     for i even: a + b + a <=1 => 2a + b <= 1
#     for i odd: b + a + b <=1 => 2b + a <= 1
#   Optimize a and b with these inequalities to maximize sum

import itertools

# Uniform pattern
c = 1/3
sum_uniform = 100 * c**2
print("Uniform pattern sum approximation:", sum_uniform)

# Alternating pattern attempt
max_sum_alt = 0
for a in [i/10 for i in range(0, 4)]:  # a in [0, 0.3]
    for b in [i/10 for i in range(0, 4)]:  # b in [0, 0.3]
        if 2*a + b <=1 and 2*b + a <=1:
            # sum over 100 elements, alternating a and b
            sum_alt = 50 * a * a + 50 * b * b  # as each appears 50 times
            if sum_alt > max_sum_alt:
                max_sum_alt = sum_alt
print("Alternating pattern max sum:", max_sum_alt)

# The maximum is approximately around the uniform pattern or slightly better if possible
# with more complex patterns, but given constraints, uniform or alternating patterns 
# give close approximations.
