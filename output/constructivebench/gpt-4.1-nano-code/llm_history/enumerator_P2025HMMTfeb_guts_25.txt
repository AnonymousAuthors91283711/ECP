The problem involves a puzzle about a process starting with 20 blue and 25 purple units and taking 44 steps, resulting in a final answer of 173/4. Since details are sparse, we can explore all possible values of some parameters and look for patterns or answers matching the provided ratio.

Given the parameters:
- initial_blue = 20
- initial_purple = 25
- steps = 44

and the final answer is 173/4, approximate to 43.25.

A reasonable approach is to consider small variations around the fixed initial values and create all combinations within a reasonable range, then identify any combinations where the resulting calculation approaches 173/4.

Since the details are abstracted, we simulate a process where the answer depends linearly or polynomially on initial purple and blue nodes, perhaps within small bounds.

```python
# Enumerate small variations of initial_blue and initial_purple around their given values
# Since the original problem has fixed initial_blue=20, initial_purple=25, steps=44,
# and final answer approximately 43.25, we try nearby values to find matches.

from fractions import Fraction

# Fixed parameters
initial_blue_orig = 20
initial_purple_orig = 25
steps = 44

# Define small ranges around the original initial values for exploration
blue_range = range(18, 23)  # within 2 units of 20
purple_range = range(23, 28) # within 2 units of 25

# We assume a linear relation for demonstration: answer â‰ˆ a * purple + b * blue + c
# Since we don't have the actual formula, we simulate the process with a placeholder relation to find matching parameters.

# The approximate target answer
target = Fraction(173, 4)

# Store candidates that approximate the target answer
candidates = []

for blue in blue_range:
    for purple in purple_range:
        # Since no explicit formula is given, simulate an answer based on the given values:
        # For demonstration, assume answer = (purple + blue) * some factor
        # To approximate 43.25, we estimate factors based on original values
        # Let's consider answer = (purple + blue) * 1.3
        answer = (purple + blue) * Fraction(13, 10)  # 1.3

        # Compute difference with target
        diff = abs(answer - target)

        # If within small tolerance, record
        if diff <= 0.01:
            print(f"Blue: {blue}, Purple: {purple}, Answer: {float(answer)}")
            candidates.append((blue, purple, answer))

# Additionally, if no close candidates found, report the closest
if not candidates:
    # Find the closest candidate in the searched ranges
    min_diff = None
    closest = None
    for blue in blue_range:
        for purple in purple_range:
            answer = (purple + blue) * Fraction(13, 10)
            diff = abs(answer - target)
            if min_diff is None or diff < min_diff:
                min_diff = diff
                closest = (blue, purple, answer)
    print(f"Closest: Blue: {closest[0]}, Purple: {closest[1]}, Answer: {float(closest[2])}")
