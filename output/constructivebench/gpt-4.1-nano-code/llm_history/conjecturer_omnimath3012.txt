9
12
15
18
Total count: 6. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the enumerated values (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18), the pattern suggests these are multiples of 3 between 1 and 20, inclusive. The numbers are consecutive multiples of 3 starting from 3 up to 18. The total count is 6, which matches this pattern.  

Final answer in Lean: <<<6>>>
