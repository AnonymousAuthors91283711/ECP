open Real Polynomial

noncomputable abbrev omnimath3176_answer : Polynomial (Polynomial ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3176 (P : Polynomial (Polynomial ℤ)) :
  (∀ (a : ℝ), eval (eval P ⌊a⌋) ⌊2 * a⌋ = 0) ↔ P = omnimath3176_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate polynomial coefficients: (0,)
Candidate polynomial coefficients: (0, 0)
Candidate polynomial coefficients: (0, 0, 0)
. Expected Answer Type: Polynomial (Polynomial ℤ)
The pattern suggests that the polynomial must evaluate to zero at all real a when substituting ⌊a⌋ and ⌊2a⌋, which strongly indicates P should be the zero polynomial, as no nontrivial polynomial can satisfy this for all real a unless identically zero.
