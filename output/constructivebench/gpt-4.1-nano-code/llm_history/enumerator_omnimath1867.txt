The problem involves finding the ratio of the count of numbers between 1 and 2016 inclusive that are coprime to 2015, over the total count (2016). This is related to Euler's totient function φ(2015) because the numerator is φ(2015). Since 2015 factors as 5 * 13 * 31, we can compute φ(2015) using the multiplicative property of totients.

To assist in conjecturing, we'll enumerate the coprime numbers explicitly for small sample cases and verify the ratio. The ratio should be φ(2015)/2016, but we'll verify this by enumeration.

```python
from math import gcd

# Parameters
start, end = 1, 2016
total_numbers = end - start + 1

# Enumerate numbers coprime to 2015
coprimes = []

# Since 2015 factors as 5 * 13 * 31, we can explicitly verify coprimality
for k in range(start, end + 1):
    if gcd(k, 2015) == 1:
        coprimes.append(k)
        print(k)

# Compute approximate ratio
ratio = len(coprimes) / total_numbers
print("Number of coprime integers:", len(coprimes))
print("Ratio:", ratio)

# Compute φ(2015)
phi_2015 = 2015
for p in [5, 13, 31]:
    phi_2015 -= phi_2015 // p
print("φ(2015):", phi_2015)

# The exact rational answer
from fractions import Fraction
answer = Fraction(phi_2015, 2016)
print("Exact ratio:", answer)
```
