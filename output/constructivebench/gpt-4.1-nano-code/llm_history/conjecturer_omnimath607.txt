Number of a's with exactly 6 favorable b's: 24
Total pairs: 1296
Favorable outcomes: 144
Probability: 0.018518518518518517
. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Based on enumeration, the points with exactly 6 favorable outcomes form a symmetric pattern across the 6x6 grid, so the probability reduces to (number of such a's) * (6/36) /36 = 24 * 6 / 36^2 = 144/1296 = 1/9. 

Thus, particular a with 6 favorable b's each contribute (6/36), and overall proportion is 24/36 = 2/3. 

Final expression: <<<(2/3 : ℚ)>>>
