The problem involves verifying whether certain sequences of operations can transform an initial state into a fixed large value, with constraints. Since the problem is complex and involves exploring sequences subject to operations, an effective approach for conjecture is to generate all sequences of small length with certain operations and check their effects.

Given the constraints:
- The initial state updates only indices 0 to 5 (since n<6).
- The operations are limited to sequences of length up to some small threshold to keep computations feasible.
- The focus is on enumerating sequences of operations (ops) that transform an initial state and possibly reaching the large target value `2010^2010^2010`.

The code below:
- Enumerates small sequences (say, length up to 3 or 4, for manageable computation).
- Applies the operations to the initial state to see what values are achievable.
- Prints the sequences that result in specific target states, especially large values like `2010^2010^2010`.
- Prioritizes exact matches, approximations are not generated, aligning with the requirements.

This approach provides concrete examples, helping form conjectures about whether such transformations can reach the target state or not.

```python
import itertools
import operator

# Maximum sequence length for enumeration (small due to complexity)
MAX_SEQ_LEN = 4

# Initial state: a function returning 0 except index 5, which is a huge number
initial_state_value = pow(2010, pow(2010, 2010))
initial_state = [0,0,0,0,0,initial_state_value]

# Operation generators
def generate_operations():
    # sum operations on indices 0..4
    sum_ops = [('Sum.inl', j) for j in range(5)]
    # product operations (k) on indices 0..3 (to avoid out of bounds)
    prod_ops = [('Sum.inr', k) for k in range(4)]
    return sum_ops + prod_ops

operations_list = generate_operations()

# Apply a sequence of ops to initial state
def apply_ops(seq):
    s = initial_state[:]
    for op_type, idx in seq:
        if idx < 0 or idx >= 6:
            continue
        if op_type == 'Sum.inl':  # addition
            if s[idx] > 0:
                s[idx] -= 1
                s[idx+1] += 2
        elif op_type == 'Sum.inr':  # multiplication-like
            if s[idx] > 0:
                s[idx] -= 1
                temp = s[idx+1]
                s[idx+1] = s[idx+2]
                s[idx+2] = temp
    return s

# Enumerate all sequences up to MAX_SEQ_LEN
found_sequences = []
target_value = initial_state_value

for length in range(1, MAX_SEQ_LEN+1):
    for seq in itertools.product(operations_list, repeat=length):
        result_state = apply_ops(seq)
        # Check if result matches target
        if result_state[5] == target_value:
            print(f"Found sequence leading to target: {seq}")
            print(f"Resulting state: {result_state}")

# Summary: Output sequences that produce the largest known value for conjecture
```
