The problem involves finding the number of divisors `d` of a number `n`, where `n` is between 1 and 30, such that `d` divides 80 as well, and then verifying that the count of such divisors is 2 for a specific `n`. Our goal is to enumerate all `n` from 1 to 30 and count such divisors, then identify the `n` where this count equals 2, so as to deduce the answer.

We'll approach this by:
- Iterating over all `n` from 1 to 30.
- For each `n`, find the divisors `d` that satisfy `d > 0`, divide `n`, and 80, and count them.
- For `n` where the count is 2, output `n`.

This approach is efficient enough given the small range, and includes immediate printing for each candidateâ€”matching the requirement.

```python
# Enumerate n from 1 to 30
for n in range(1, 31):
    divisors_of_n = [d for d in range(1, n+1) if n % d == 0]
    # Filter divisors d that also divide 80
    count = sum(1 for d in divisors_of_n if 80 % d == 0)
    print(f"n={n}, divisors={divisors_of_n}, divisors dividing 80={count}")
    if count == 2:
        print(f"Found n={n} with exactly 2 such divisors.")
```
