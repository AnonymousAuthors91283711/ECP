This problem involves nested extremal conditions with geometric interpretations involving points, distances, and norms. To assist in formulating an answer, I will approximate the possible values of `a` and `b` that satisfy the given constraints, especially focusing on the outer minimality condition based on the geometric problem.

Since the code references the maximum of certain norms involving points constrained on a circle of radius 1 around `(0, 4)`, and the minimal `s` computed from squares `a'^2 + b'^2`, I plan to generate small samples over plausible `(a, b)` pairs and evaluate the inner and outer extremal conditions.

In particular:
- We will iterate over small `a` and `b` values (say, in [-10, 10]) with a step.
- For each `(a, b)` pair, we'll consider potential `D` points on the circle of radius 1 around `(0,4)`.
- For each `D`, compute `r = ‖(a,0)+(0,b)+D‖`.
- Find the maximum inner `r`.
- Then, find the minimal `s = a'^2 + b'^2` such that the maximum inner `r` is at least 6.
- When the minimal `s` is achieved, print it.

This approach is a heuristic approximation to gather potential answers without hardcoding, exploiting geometric intuition.
