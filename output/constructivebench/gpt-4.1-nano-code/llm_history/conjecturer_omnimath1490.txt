The problem seeks the greatest prime p involved in a prime set s where the average of s is 27, and p is in s. For the average to be 27, sum(s) = 27 * |s|, so s's elements are primes with sum divisible by size, and one prime equals that average, i.e., p = 27. Since 27 is not prime, p cannot be 27. The largest prime less than or equal to 27 is 23, which can satisfy the sum condition when s contains 23 and other primes summing appropriately. Thus, the greatest prime in such s is 23.
