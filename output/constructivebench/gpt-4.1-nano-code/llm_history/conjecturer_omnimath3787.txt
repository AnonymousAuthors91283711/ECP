Since the pattern shows permutations with the same structure and the smallest elements 3 and 3, and the pattern involves primes and the quadratic form, the closed form reflects these solutions. The common pattern suggests the solutions are {(3, 3, 2, 3), (3, 17, 3, 7), (17, 3, 3, 7)} corresponding to specific parameterizations. These can be summarized as the set containing all (a, b, c, k) where (a, b, c) are primes satisfying the quadratic form, with the smallest prime 3 or 17, and k related by the pattern.

Given the enumeration of specific solutions, the pattern involves permutations of primes (3 and 17) and their relations to the quadratic form \( a^2 + b^2 + 16 c^2 = 9 k^2 + 1 \). The solutions suggest that the solution set includes exactly these triplets where \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( k \) satisfy the form, and prime constraints.

Since the solutions explicitly listed are only three triplets, and the problem's structure suggests these are isolated solutions rather than a parametric family, the simplest closed-form answer is the finite set of these solutions, properly formatted in Lean syntax.

The primary fix involves replacing the incorrect "Since" and other syntax errors with a proper Lean expression for the set of solutions, using `Set.ofList` or `{}` notation, and explicitly listing out solutions.

Thus, the corrected final answer:

The key is to define a set containing the exact solutions listed. Recognizing the pattern, the solutions are finite and specific triplets of primes satisfying the quadratic relation with prime \(a, b, c\) being either 3 or 17, and corresponding \(k\). The simplest correct Lean expression is a set literal with these tuples.
