This is a math problem involving real numbers, trigonometric functions, and an equation, where we're asked to find all x satisfying certain inequalities and an equation, and then define a set of such solutions. To assist in conjecturing, I will write a Python script that searches for all solutions within a small interval around zero (since the bounds involve π/2), by sampling points with a small step size, checking the equation, and printing solutions.

The constraints:
- Search in the interval `(-π/2, π/2)`
- Use small step size for precision
- Avoid computations outside bounds
- Print solutions (approximations) as they are found

Here's the Python code accomplishing this:

```python
import math

# Define bounds
lower_bound = -math.pi / 2
upper_bound = math.pi / 2
step = 0.001  # small step for sampling

solutions = []

x = lower_bound
while x < upper_bound:
    # Compute the left side of the equation
    val = 1 - math.sin(x) ** 4 - math.cos(x) ** 2
    # Check if close to 1/16 within a small tolerance
    if abs(val - 1/16) < 0.001:
        # Store and print the approximate solution
        solutions.append(x)
        print(f"Solution: x ≈ {x:.4f}")
    x += step
```

This script systematically samples within the interval, checks the equation, and prints each approximate solution as it finds it, aiding in conjecture.
