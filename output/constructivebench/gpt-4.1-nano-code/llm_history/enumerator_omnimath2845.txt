The problem asks to find the greatest possible value of `y = f(8)` given a sequence `f` from `Fin 9` with certain properties:
- Injective and only taking values in the set {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13}.
- Boundary conditions: `f(0) = x`, `f(8) = y`.
- `f(1) = f(0) + f(2)`, `f(3) = f(2) + f(4)`, `f(5) = f(4) + f(6)`, `f(7) = f(6) + f(8)`.

By exploring small values systematically, especially the possible values for each `f(i)` consistent with the restrictions, we can track candidate sequences that maximize `f(8)`.

```python
# We will enumerate possible values for f at key points based on the constraints and try to maximize y = f(8).
# The set of allowed values.
allowed_values = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13}

# Store maximum y found.
max_y = -1
max_sequence = None

# To reduce computation, we will iterate over possible f(0) and f(2), then derive subsequent values.
for f0 in allowed_values:
    for f2 in allowed_values:
        # f(1) = f0 + f2 must be in allowed set
        f1 = f0 + f2
        if f1 not in allowed_values:
            continue

        # Choose f(4) in allowed set
        for f4 in allowed_values:
            # f(3) = f2 + f4 must be allowed
            f3 = f2 + f4
            if f3 not in allowed_values:
                continue

            # f(6) in allowed set
            for f6 in allowed_values:
                # f(5) = f4 + f6 must be allowed
                f5 = f4 + f6
                if f5 not in allowed_values:
                    continue

                # f(8) = y, f(7) = f6 + f8
                # We want to maximize f8 given these fixed previous values.
                for f8 in allowed_values:
                    # Verify injectivity: all f(i) uniquely assigned
                    sequence = [f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, None, f8]
                    # f(7) = f6 + f8
                    f7 = f6 + f8
                    if f7 not in allowed_values:
                        continue
                    sequence[7] = f7

                    # Check all values are unique so far
                    if len(set(sequence)) != 9:
                        continue

                    # Confirm sequence is valid with the constraints
                    # Conditions already checked, so just update max if needed
                    if f8 > max_y:
                        max_y = f8
                        max_sequence = sequence

# Output the maximum value for y (= f(8))
print(f"Maximum y (f(8)) = {max_y}")
# Optionally, print the sequence
print(f"Sequence achieving this maximum: {max_sequence}")
```
