(92, 30)
(30, 92). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
Given the symmetry in the solutions, and based on integer solutions to the equation n^2 + m^2 = 9364 with both n, m > 0, the solutions are (30, 92) and (92, 30). The answer set is the set containing these pairs with ordered pairs as per the pattern observed.
