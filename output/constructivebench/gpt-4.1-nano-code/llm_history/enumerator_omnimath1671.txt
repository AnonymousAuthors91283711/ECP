The problem appears to be about solving a system of two equations involving variables \(x, y\) with certain constraints, likely deriving a unique solution for a point on the plane. The key equations include ratios involving \(x\), \(y\), and their distances from the origin. Given the structure, a plausible approach is to try to find candidate solutions that satisfy these equations analytically or numerically. 

Since the system involves radicals and ratios, approximate numeric methods will help identify solutions. We can implement a brute-force enumeration over small ranges for \(x\) and \(y\), compute the expressions, and check for solutions within a small tolerance. When a candidate fits, print it immediately. This aligns with the requirement to output answers immediately, and is efficient enough for small ranges.

Here's a Python program that searches over a small grid of \(x, y\) values, evaluates the equations, and prints solutions with high accuracy:

```python
# Search small ranges of x, y to find solutions to the system
# Equations:
# (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) - 1/x ≈ 7
# (y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) + 1/y ≈ 4
# with constraints x,y ≠ 0

import math

tolerance = 1e-5

# Range of values to search; small to limit computation
for x_int in range(-50, 51):
    for y_int in range(-50, 51):
        if x_int == 0 or y_int == 0:
            continue
        x = x_int / 10
        y = y_int / 10
        r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
        # Compute both equations
        eq1 = (x / r) - 1/x
        eq2 = (y / r) + 1/y
        # Check if close enough to 7 and 4 respectively
        if abs(eq1 - 7) < tolerance and abs(eq2 - 4) < tolerance:
            print(f"Found candidate: x={x:.2f}, y={y:.2f} => eq1={eq1:.6f}, eq2={eq2:.6f}")
```

Let's analyze the problem and the code carefully:

**Problem Details:**
- The problem involves real numbers \(x, y\) satisfying the system:
  \[
  \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} - \frac{1}{x} = 7
  \]
  \[
  \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} + \frac{1}{y} = 4
  \]
- The statement suggests a unique solution \((x, y)\).
- The formal statement aims to show that for any such pair satisfying the conditions, it is equal to some specific answer, and that this answer is unique.

**Code Analysis:**
- The code searches over a small grid in \(\pm 5\) to give approximate solutions.
- It skips points where \(x=0\) or \(y=0\) (to avoid division by zero).
- It calculates the equations and checks if they are within \(1e-5\) of the target values (7 and 4).
- **It prints only when it finds candidates matching those approximate equations.**
- **The search space is very limited (from \(-5\) to 5 in steps of 0.1), and the tolerance is tight.** 
- **No matches are found, leading to an empty output.**

**Judgement:**
- The code's approach is to find solutions by brute force in a tiny region.
- Given the constraints and the nature of the equations, solutions may exist outside the sampled set, or the approximate grid might be too coarse.
- The logic of the problem suggests a unique solution exists, but the code does not explore sufficiently large or varied ranges or utilize more refined methods.
- Moreover, the original problem seems theoretical, intending to find an exact solution, not approximate numerics.

**Acceptance:**
- Since the code does not produce any solutions, it does not satisfy the problem's goal of enumerating the answers.
- The problem asks to output solutions immediately upon finding them.
- The provided code is too limited and does not produce any answers, failing the "streaming" criterion.
- Also, the code uses only brute-force sampling, which is incompatible with the expectation of efficiency, but acceptable for demonstration purposes here.

**Conclusion:**
- The original code is rejected because it produces no answers, thus failing to fulfill the requirement of enumerating solutions.

[refine_program]
The provided program contains no executable code or enumeration logic; it only has a noncomputable placeholder and a theorem declared with `sorry`. Consequently, it cannot produce any answers, and the enumeration outputs nothing. 

According to the instructions, the program must be able to produce results immediately, ideally enumerate all candidate solutions that satisfy the conditions, and print answers in a streaming fashion. Since the original code is essentially missing, it does not meet any of the requirements.

**Judgement:** The original program is not acceptable.

**Corrected Approach:**
We want to find all solutions `(x, y)` satisfying the given equations:
- \( x \neq 0 \), \( y \neq 0 \),
- \( x^2 + y^2 \neq 0 \),
- \( \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} - \frac{1}{x} = 7 \),
- \( \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \).

Given the nature of the problem, it's suitable to numerically scan over some small ranges of `x` and `y` and check if the equations hold approximately (within a small epsilon). For each candidate, we can print the solution immediately if it satisfies the equations closely.

Below is an implementation that:
- Uses small, representative ranges of `x` and `y`.
- Checks the equations for approximate equality.
- Prints solutions immediately upon verifying they satisfy the equations within a tolerance.

This approach aligns with the enumerator-like behaviour, avoids hardcoded answers, and respects the constraints.
