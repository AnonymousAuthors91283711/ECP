The problem involves finding the greatest length of a sequence of knight moves on a 5x5 chessboard, where each move follows the knight's move pattern, and no position repeats (no duplicates). To approach this, we need to generate sequences of positions, check the knight move condition between consecutive positions, and find the maximum sequence length that satisfies these conditions.

Given the problem's combinatorial nature, we'll:

- Generate all possible paths starting from each position.
- Use backtracking to count the longest sequence of moves possible.
- Stream results: whenever we find a length, print it immediately.
- Limit search to ensure efficiencyâ€”since 5x5 is small, full enumeration is feasible.

Here's the Python code that constructs this logic:

```python
# Enumeration of knight moves on a 5x5 grid to find the maximum sequence length
# where each step is a valid knight move and no position repeats.

# Define knight move offsets
knight_moves = [(1,3), (1,-3), (3,1), (3,-1), (-1,3), (-1,-3), (-3,1), (-3,-1)]

# Generate all positions on the 5x5 board
positions = [(x, y) for x in range(5) for y in range(5)]

# For efficiency, precompute adjacency list of possible moves for each position
adj = {}
for pos in positions:
    adj[pos] = []
    for dx, dy in knight_moves:
        nx, ny = pos[0] + dx, pos[1] + dy
        if 0 <= nx < 5 and 0 <= ny < 5:
            adj[pos].append((nx, ny))

max_length = 1  # Initialize maximum sequence length

# Recursive backtracking to find maximum path length starting from a given position
def dfs(current, visited):
    global max_length
    length = len(visited)
    if length > max_length:
        max_length = length
        print(f"Found sequence length: {max_length}")
    for neighbor in adj[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs(neighbor, visited + [neighbor])

# Run DFS from each position
for start in positions:
    dfs(start, [start])

# Report the maximum found
print(f"Maximum sequence length: {max_length}")
```
