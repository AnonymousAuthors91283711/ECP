Based on the pattern, the index l involves powers of 5 with exponents related to 25 * l and 25 * l + 1, and the product A l ranges from 4l+1 to 4 * (5^5+1) * l. The minimal l satisfying P l corresponds to the lowest l for which 5^{25 l} divides the product but 5^{25 l + 1} does not, suggesting l=0 as the minimal index. The exponent pattern indicates the answer likely involves a power of 5, specifically 5^{25 * 0} = 1. Given this, the simplest closed-form expression for the minimal l with the described divisibility properties is zero.
