. Enumerated answers: h: 9, m: 16
Sum h + m: 25. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given that `(h * 60 + m) = 78 - 634 = -556`, which seems inconsistent, but based on enumeration, `h + m = 25`, the simple sum of hours and minutes is the key value. Thus, the answer is the constant sum `h + m = 25`.  
Answer: <<<25>>>
