  IsLeast {k : ℕ | Finset.sum (Finset.range k) (fun i => 2 * i + 1) = n} (P2004AMCB_8_answer n) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 10. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The sum of the first k odd numbers is k². To get 100, find k with k² = 100, so k=10. The minimal such k is 10. The answer matches the pattern from the enumeration.
