The problem involves finding all pairs (x, y) of natural numbers satisfying the equation:
\[ x^3 y + x + y = x y + 2 x y^2. \]

Let's analyze the equation:
\[ x^3 y + x + y = x y + 2 x y^2. \]
Bring all to one side:
\[ x^3 y + x + y - x y - 2 x y^2 = 0. \]

Group similar terms:
\[ (x^3 y - x y) + x + y - 2 x y^2 = 0. \]
Factor where possible:
\[ x y (x^2 - 1) + x + y - 2 x y^2 = 0. \]

Notice the symmetry and the structure suggesting small values testing. We'll implement an enumerator over small values of (x, y):
- For example, \( x, y \) from 0 to 20.
- Check the equation, and if satisfied, print the pair.

This approach is sufficient for high school level, small bounds, and helps in conjecturing solutions.

```python
# Enumerate small (x, y) pairs to find solutions to the given equation.
# Equation: x^3 * y + x + y == x * y + 2 * x * y^2

limit = 20
answers = []

for x in range(limit + 1):
    for y in range(limit + 1):
        lhs = x**3 * y + x + y
        rhs = x * y + 2 * x * y**2
        if lhs == rhs:
            answers.append((x, y))
            print((x, y))
```
