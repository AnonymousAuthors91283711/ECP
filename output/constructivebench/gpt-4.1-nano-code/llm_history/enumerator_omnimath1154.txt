The problem involves analyzing the function f(x, y) = max of three expressions over a domain defined by 0 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1, and then finding the least value of f(x, y) over that domain. To help conjecture the minimum of this function, I'll enumerate relevant (x, y) points on a grid within the domain, compute the function value at each point, and find the minimal value among these samples.

Since the domain is 0 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1, I'll sample x at small increments (say 0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1), and for each x, sample y from x to 1 (to satisfy y ≥ x), with the same step size. This will enable approximate enumeration of potential minimum points.

The code will:
- Iterate over sampled x and y values, respecting the domain constraints.
- Compute f(x, y) at each point.
- Print each computed value immediately.
- Track the minimum value found among samples.
- At the end, print the minimal value identified to help in conjecture.

```python
# Enumerate (x, y) in [0,1] with step size 0.1, respecting 0 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1
step = 0.1
min_value = float('inf')
min_point = None

for xi in range(11):
    x = xi * step
    for yi in range(xi, 11):
        y = yi * step
        # Compute the three expressions
        expr1 = x * y
        expr2 = 1 - x - y + x * y
        expr3 = x + y - 2 * x * y
        f_xy = max(expr1, expr2, expr3)
        print(f"x={x:.2f}, y={y:.2f}, f={f_xy}")
        if f_xy < min_value:
            min_value = f_xy
            min_point = (x, y)

print(f"Approximate minimum value: {min_value} at point {min_point}")
```
