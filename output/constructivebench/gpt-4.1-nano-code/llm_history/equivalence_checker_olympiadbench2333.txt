theorem olympiadbench2333 (p : ℝ) (hp : 0 ≤ p ∧ p ≤ 1) :
    ∃ (a b c d : ℤ), d ≠ 0 ∧ olympiadbench2333_answer p = (a * p^2 + b * p + c) / d := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun p => (1 - p^2) / 3
Proposed Answer: fun p => (p + 1) * p / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function of p (with 0 ≤ p ≤ 1) that can be expressed as a quadratic polynomial in p with integer coefficients divided by a non-zero integer denominator.

2. The ground truth answer is (1 - p²)/3, which is indeed a quadratic in p with coefficients:
   a = -1, b = 0, c = 1, d = 3

3. The proposed answer is (p + 1)*p/2 = (p² + p)/2, which is also a quadratic in p with coefficients:
   a = 1, b = 1, c = 0, d = 2

While both answers satisfy the general form required by the theorem statement (they're both quadratic in p with integer coefficients divided by non-zero integer denominators), they are clearly different functions:

- At p=0: ground truth gives 1/3, proposed gives 0
- At p=1: ground truth gives 0, proposed gives 1

Since the problem doesn't specify which particular quadratic function is required (just that one exists), both answers technically satisfy the existence claim. However, they are different specific functions, so they're not equivalent.
