This problem involves counting functions from a finite set of size 9 to a set of size 3, with specified constraints on how many elements map to each value. Specifically, we need to count the number of functions `f : Fin 9 â†’ Fin 3` such that:
- exactly 3 elements map to 0,
- exactly 3 map to 1,
- exactly 3 map to 2,
- and the number of elements `i` with `f i = i` (the fixed points) is 1.

Given the symmetry and constraints, the total count involves enumeration over possible functions satisfying these conditions, factoring in the fixed point condition.

Here is a Python program that enumerates all such functions explicitly to help count and analyze the answer.

```python
import itertools
from collections import Counter

# Set small values for enumeration
n = 9
values = [0, 1, 2]

# Generate all functions (represented as lists of length 9)
# with the specified counts for 0, 1, 2
# Conditions:
# - Exactly 3 zeros, 3 ones, 3 twos
all_functions = []

# Generate all permutations of the multiset [0]*3 + [1]*3 + [2]*3
for pattern in set(itertools.permutations([0]*3 + [1]*3 + [2]*3)):
    # pattern is a function from 9 positions to 0,1,2
    # Check fixed point condition: exactly one position where i == f(i)
    fixed_points = sum(1 for i, f_i in enumerate(pattern) if i == f_i)
    if fixed_points == 1:
        # Count how many such functions
        all_functions.append(pattern)

# Print each valid function and count total
for func in all_functions:
    print(func)
print("Total count:", len(all_functions))
```

This code explicitly enumerates all functions meeting the specified constraints, ensures the fixed point condition, and prints each valid function. The total count gives the answer to the original problem, which can be used to conjecture the formula or verify it mathematically.
