The problem involves analyzing the roots of a specific polynomial \( p(x) = x^8 - 14x^4 - 8x^3 - x^2 + 1 \). We need to compute the sum of the squares of its roots, which suggests leveraging algebraic and numerical techniques. Since finding roots explicitly appears complicated, the plan is to:
- Approximate roots numerically,
- Sum their squares,
- Confirm whether the sum is an exact algebraic value or an approximation.

We focus on approximating the roots of \( p(x) \) numerically, then computing their squares and summing these values. The code avoids unnecessary computation by only approximating roots with a degree-8 polynomial, and streaming answers for each root's squared value.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the polynomial coefficients for p(x) = x^8 - 14x^4 - 8x^3 - x^2 + 1
coefficients = [1, 0, -1, -8, -14, 0, 0, 0, 1]  # Corresponds to x^8,...,constant term

# Find roots numerically
roots = np.roots(coefficients)

# Sum of squares of roots
sum_squares = 0
for r in roots:
    r_real = r.real if abs(r.imag) < 1e-8 else r
    squared = r_real**2
    print(f"Root: {r_real:.6f}, squared: {squared:.6f}")
    sum_squares += squared

print(f"Sum of squared roots: {sum_squares:.6f}")
```
