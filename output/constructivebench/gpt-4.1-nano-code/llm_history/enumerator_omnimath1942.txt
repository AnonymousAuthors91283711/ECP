The problem appears to involve finding the greatest integer \( n \) such that there exists a \( 5 \times 5 \) integer grid satisfying certain parity conditions on the sum of four grid values at specific coordinate pairs. Specifically, for all pairs of points \((r.1.1, r.1.2)\) and \((r.2.1, r.2.2)\) with both coordinates increasing, the sum of the four grid values at these points must be odd.

In essence:
- We need to consider all pairs of points in a \( 5 \times 5 \) grid.
- For each pair, consider the four grid cells at the corners of the rectangle they define.
- The sum of these four cells must be odd.
- Find the maximum \( n \) (cardinality of such a set), by examining all possible configurations.

Given the problem's complexity, it's easier to brute-force small \( n \)-values and see if a grid satisfying the parity conditions exists for those counts, then determine the maximum \( n \).

Let's implement a program that:
- Fixes small \( n \) (from 1 up to a certain maximum, e.g., 25).
- For each \( n \), enumerates all subsets of pairs (r.1, r.2) with size \( n \).
- Checks if there's a grid configuration satisfying the parity constraints for all pairs in that subset.
- Outputs the maximum \( n \) for which such a grid exists.

Because the problem can be large, we'll limit to small \( n \) (say up to 10). This is a simplified brute-force for illustrative purposes, aligned with the task constraints.

```python
import itertools

# Grid size
size = 5

# Generate all point pairs in the grid
points = list(itertools.product(range(size), repeat=2))
pair_indices = list(itertools.combinations(points, 2))

# Function to check if a grid satisfies the parity conditions for a given set of pairs
def check_grid(pairs, grid):
    for (r1, r2) in pairs:
        x1, y1 = r1
        x2, y2 = r2
        # quadruple corners: (x1,y1), (x1,y2), (x2,y1), (x2,y2)
        total = grid[x1][y1] + grid[x1][y2] + grid[x2][y1] + grid[x2][y2]
        if total % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Attempt to find a grid satisfying all conditions for a set of pairs
def exists_grid_for_pairs(pairs):
    # Try random or systematic assignment to find a match
    # Due to no input constraints, we'll try random assignments
    import random
    for _ in range(1000):
        # Random grid values between -10 and 10
        grid = [[random.randint(-10,10) for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]
        if check_grid(pairs, grid):
            return True
    return False

max_n_found = 0
max_pairs_set = []

# Limit n for brute-force
for n in range(1, 11):
    for subset in itertools.combinations(pair_indices, n):
        if exists_grid_for_pairs(subset):
            max_n_found = n
            print(f"Found grid for subset of size {n}")
            break
print(f"Maximum n with a satisfying grid: {max_n_found}")
```
