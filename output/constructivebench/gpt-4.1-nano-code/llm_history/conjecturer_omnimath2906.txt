. Enumerated answers: For x = 1.9, 4x^2 - 3x^2 = 3.6099999999999994
For x = 1.95, 4x^2 - 3x^2 = 3.8025
For x = 2.0, 4x^2 - 3x^2 = 4.0
For x = 2.05, 4x^2 - 3x^2 = 4.202500000000001
For x = 2.1, 4x^2 - 3x^2 = 4.41
For x = 2.2, 4x^2 - 3x^2 = 4.84
At x = 2, the value is 4. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<(2 : ℝ) * (2 : ℝ)>>>
This expression captures the pattern at x=2, where the value equals 4; the general formula is 4x^2 - 3x^2 = x^2, which simplifies to x^2. Given hx : x = 2, the answer is simply 4.
