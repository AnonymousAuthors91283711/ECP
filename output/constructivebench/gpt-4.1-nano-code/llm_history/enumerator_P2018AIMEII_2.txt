This problem involves analyzing the sequence defined by a recurrence relation involving modular arithmetic. To assist in conjecturing or verifying the exact value of the product `aime_sequence 2018 * aime_sequence 2020 * aime_sequence 2022`, I will write a Python script that:

- Implements the recurrence relation for `aime_sequence`.
- Computes the sequence values for pertinent indices.
- Checks the specific indices 2018, 2020, and 2022.
- Prints each result immediately for potential pattern recognition.

Because directly computing `aime_sequence` at those large indices is impractical, I'll leverage the sequence's periodicity, if any, induced by the modulus 11. Since the sequence depends mod 11, and the initial terms are small, the sequence should eventually become periodic, allowing us to analyze it efficiently.

Here's the code:

```python
# The sequence is defined mod 11 with initial terms:
# a(0)=2, a(1)=5, a(2)=8, and for n+3:
# a(n+3) = (4 * (a(n+2) + a(n+1) + a(n))) mod 11

def aime_sequence_mod11(limit_indices):
    # Generate sequence until the maximum index needed or until repetition is found.
    max_index = max(limit_indices)
    seq = [2, 5, 8]
    
    # Use a dictionary to detect cycles
    seen = {}
    index = 3
    while index <= max_index:
        next_val = (4 * (seq[-1] + seq[-2] + seq[-3])) % 11
        seq.append(next_val)
        index += 1
    
    # Output the sequence at required indices
    for i in limit_indices:
        print(f"aime_sequence({i}) mod 11 = {seq[i]}")
    return seq

# Indices to check
indices = [2018, 2020, 2022]

# Get sequence values mod 11 to analyze periodicity and values
sequence_values = aime_sequence_mod11(indices)

# Since sequence values are in mod 11, product modulo 11
product_mod_11 = 1
for val in sequence_values:
    product_mod_11 *= val
product_mod_11 %= 11
print(f"Product modulo 11 = {product_mod_11}")

# Optional: check for periodicity and deduce the actual values based on pattern detection
```
