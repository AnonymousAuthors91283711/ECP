theorem P2015AMCA_3 : 
  let students := 15
  let initial_avg := 80
  let final_avg := 81
  initial_avg * (students - 1) + P2015AMCA_3_answer = final_avg * students := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 95. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The total points change from 80*15 to 81*15, which means an increase of 15 points across the students. Since 14 students initially had an average of 80, their total is 80*14 = 1120. To reach the final total (81*15 = 1215), the last student must have earned 1215 - 1120 = 95. Hence, the answer is a fixed value, 95, independent of other parameters.
