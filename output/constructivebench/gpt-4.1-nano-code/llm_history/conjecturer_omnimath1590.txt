Total solutions: 198. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the patterns in the enumerated solutions, the count of solutions appears to be symmetric around zero, with negative integers from -50 to -1, and positive integers from 1 to 50, plus some additional solutions at 102–149, 102–149. The total solutions are 198, suggesting the total count is 2*50 + some extra.

The symmetry indicates the solution set's cardinality is 2 * 50, i.e., 100 solutions, or considering the exact mirrors, it is 100. But the total is 198, which suggests asymmetric solutions at the higher range, likely +102 to +149, which contribute 48 solutions in addition to the 50 positive and 50 negative solutions plus the 2 solutions at +0 (which is not in the list, so no zero).

Thus, the total count of solutions is 198, matching the sum of fixed positive and negative solutions plus extra ones.

Given the pattern, the total number of solutions is 198, which hints that the count is 2 × 99 solutions.

Final answer: the total number of solutions is 198.

Lean expression:

<<<198>>>
