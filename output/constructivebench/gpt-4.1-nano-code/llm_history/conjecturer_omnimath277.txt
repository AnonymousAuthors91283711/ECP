Given the pattern, the values resemble the sequence: 0, 1, 1/2, 1, 2/3. Noticing the pattern at specific n:
- For n=0: 0
- For n=1: 1
- For n=2: 1/2
- For n=3: 1
- For n=4: 2/3

This alternates between 1 and a fraction decreasing from 1/2, 2/3,... The pattern suggests that for even n, the answer is n/(n+1), and for odd n, it's 1. 

However, the pattern is consistent with the function:
- When n is even: n / (n + 1)
- When n is odd: 1

In Lean, this can be expressed as:
- for n, if n % 2 = 0, then n / (n + 1), else 1.

Hence, the answer: 

<<<fun n : ℕ => if n % 2 = 0 then n / (n + 1) else 1>>>
