theorem P2012AIMEII_2 :
  ∃ (r : ℝ) (a b : ℕ → ℝ),
    (∀ n, a n = 27 * r^(n-1)) ∧ 
    (∀ n, b n = 99 * r^(n-1)) ∧ 
    a 15 = b 11 ∧ 
    a 9 = P2012AIMEII_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 362.99999999999994
362.99999999999994
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests an exponential relation with common ratio r, where a_n and b_n are geometric sequences. Using the relation at n=15 and n=11, and known constants, the solution hints at a ratio r that simplifies to a value around 3e2. Conjecturing based on geometric progression, the answer is close to 363.
