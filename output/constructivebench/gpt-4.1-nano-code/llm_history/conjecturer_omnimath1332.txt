abbrev omnimath1332_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1332 : 
  let curve1 (x y : ℝ) := x^2 = x + y + 4
  let curve2 (x y : ℝ) := y^2 = y - 15 * x + 36
  let solutions := {x : ℝ | ∃ y, curve1 x y ∧ curve2 x y}
  ∃ (s : Finset ℝ), (∀ x, x ∈ s ↔ x ∈ solutions) ∧ s.sum id = omnimath1332_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solution: x=2.0, y=-2.0
Solution: x=1.2360679774997898, y=-3.708203932499369
Solution: x=-3.23606797749979, y=9.70820393249937
Total sum of x-coordinates: 0.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The sum of all x-coordinates is zero, based on the symmetry of the solutions around the y-axis and the known solutions. Therefore, the answer is:

<<<0.0>>>
