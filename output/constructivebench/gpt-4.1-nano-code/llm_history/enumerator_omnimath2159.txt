The problem seems to involve graph coloring of a specific graph where vertices are elements of V = Fin 9 (numbers from 0 to 8). Adjacency is defined by consecutive differences, and triangles are sets of 3 vertices with particular properties. The goal appears to be to determine the minimal number of colors needed to properly color the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, and that all vertices in any triangle are assigned distinct colors. Then, the number of such colorings with that minimum number of colors is considered.

Here's a Python code snippet that explores small cases for the minimal coloring number and counts valid colorings, streaming partial answers, and making conjectures based on small sample values. Since the explicit graph and its properties are complex to fully emulate, the code uses heuristic enumeration with small k values.

```python
# Enumerate smallest k for which valid colorings exist and count the number of colorings
def valid_colorings(k):
    V = list(range(9))
    adj_pairs = [(v, w) for v in V for w in V if v != w and (abs(v - w) == 1)]
    # Generate all colorings
    from itertools import product
    count = 0
    for c in product(range(k), repeat=9):
        # Check adjacency
        if any(c[v] == c[w] for v, w in adj_pairs):
            continue
        # Check triangles
        triangles = [
            {0,1,2}, {3,4,5}, {6,7,8},
            {0,3,6}, {1,4,7}, {2,5,8},
            {0,4,8}, {2,4,6}
        ]
        valid = True
        for t in triangles:
            colors = {c[v] for v in t}
            if(len(colors) != 3):
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1
    return count

# Find minimal k
k = 2
while True:
    count = valid_colorings(k)
    print(f"Number of valid colorings with k={k}: {count}")
    if count > 0:
        break
    k += 1

print(f"Minimal k: {k}")
# For demonstration, approximate number (if needed), but here we just print for small k

```
