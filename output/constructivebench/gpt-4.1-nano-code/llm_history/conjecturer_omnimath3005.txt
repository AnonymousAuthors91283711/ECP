. Enumerated answers: N = 667, sum of digits = 19. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The repeated pattern with N mod 10, 11, 12 equal to 7 indicates N's last digit is 7, and N fits a certain congruence form. Since only N=667 in the specific range matches the sum of digits 19, and the problem asks for a closed-form answer, it suggests the digit sum is constant for this class. Therefore, the answer is 19, based on the pattern.

<<<19>>>
