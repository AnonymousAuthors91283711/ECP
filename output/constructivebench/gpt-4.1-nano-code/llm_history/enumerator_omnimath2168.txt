The problem appears to involve analyzing a polynomial \( Q p \) over real numbers, specifically looking for three distinct roots \( x, y, z \). The goal is to identify all parameters \( p \in \mathbb{R} \) for which there exist three distinct roots of \( Q p \).

Here's how to approach this:  
- We will focus on a specific polynomial family \( Q p \), which could be, for example, a quadratic or cubic polynomial parameterized by \( p \).  
- Since the original code fragment seems incomplete (with a placeholder `sorry`), the precise \( Q p \) is unspecified.  
- To make an effective enumeration, assume a plausible polynomial \( Q p \) with roots depending on \( p \).  
- For illustration, suppose \( Q p \) is a cubic polynomial \( x^3 + p x + 1 \).

The enumeration will:  
- Iterate over small \( p \) values.  
- For each \( p \), find the roots of \( Q p \).  
- Check if there are three real, distinct roots.  
- Output each \( p \) satisfying the condition.

This approach helps conjecture the set of \( p \) values for which \( Q p \) has three distinct roots.

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample polynomial family: Q_p(x) = x^3 + p * x + 1
# We analyze for parameters p in a small range where roots are real and distinct.

# Define parameter range
p_values = np.linspace(-3, 3, 61)  # from -3 to 3 in steps of 0.1

for p in p_values:
    # Polynomial coefficients for Q_p(x) = x^3 + p*x + 1
    coeffs = [1, 0, p, 1]
    roots = np.roots(coeffs)
    real_roots = roots[np.isreal(roots)].real
    # Count distinct real roots
    if len(np.unique(np.round(real_roots, decimals=8))) >= 3:
        # Check if roots are distinct
        if len(np.unique(np.round(real_roots, decimals=8))) == 3:
            # Output p when conditions satisfied
            print("p =", p)
```
