Let's analyze the problem:

We need to find the number of integers \( k \) from 1 to 2013 inclusive such that \( k^k \equiv 1 \pmod{10} \). To do this efficiently, we will examine the pattern of last digits of \( k^k \) depending on the last digit of \( k \).

Key observations:
- The last digit of \( k^k \) depends on \( k \mod 10 \).
- For each last digit \( d \in \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\} \), \( d^k \mod 10 \) follows a cycle.

Precomputing:
- 0: last digit always 0, so \( 0^k \equiv 0 \) mod 10, never 1.
- 1: always 1, so \( 1^k \equiv 1 \).
- 2: cycle (2,4,8,6), pattern repeats every 4.
- 3: cycle (3,9,7,1), pattern repeats every 4.
- 4: cycle (4,6), repeats every 2.
- 5: always 5.
- 6: always 6.
- 7: cycle (7,9,3,1).
- 8: cycle (8,4,2,6).
- 9: cycle (9,1).

Now, only bases ending with 1 or 9 can produce last digit 1 if the exponent has the right property:
- For 1: always 1.
- For 9: last digit 9^k mod 10 is 1 iff k is odd, since 9^odd ≡ 9 mod 10, 9^even ≡ 1 mod 10. Correction: 9^k mod 10:
  - 9^1 = 9, last digit 9
  - 9^2 = 81, last digit 1
  So for 9^k to be 1 mod 10, k must be even.

Similarly, for other bases:
- 3: last digit 1 happens when k ≡ 4 mod 4, i.e., k ≡ 0 mod 4 (since pattern is (3,9,7,1))
- 7: last digit 1 when k ≡ 4 mod 4
- 3 and 7 need k mod 4 = 0 for last digit 1.
- 2: cycle length 4, last digit 1 when k ≡ 0 mod 4.
- 8: cycle length 4, last digit 1 when k ≡ 4 mod 4.
- 4: last digit 4 or 6, but never 1.
- 5: always 5.
- 6: always 6.

Thus, last digit of \( k^k \equiv 1 \pmod{10} \) if:
- \( k \) ends with 1: always.
- \( k \) ends with 9: \( k \) even.
- \( k \) ends with 3 or 7: \( k \) divisible by 4.
- \( k \) ends with 2 or 8: \( k \) divisible by 4.

Now, counting how many numbers from 1 to 2013 satisfy each criterion:

Let's implement this:

```python
# Count numbers from 1 to 2013 with specific last digits and conditions
limit = 2013
count = 0

for k in range(1, limit + 1):
    last_digit = k % 10
    if last_digit == 1:
        # always last digit 1
        count += 1
        print(k)  # stream answer
    elif last_digit == 9:
        # last digit 9, k must be even
        if k % 2 == 0:
            count += 1
            print(k)
    elif last_digit in {3, 7, 2, 8}:
        # k divisible by 4
        if k % 4 == 0:
            count += 1
            print(k)

print("Total count:", count)
# For the problem, we only need the count:
print("Answer:", count)
```
