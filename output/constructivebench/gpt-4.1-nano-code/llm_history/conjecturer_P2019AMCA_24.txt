Total count: 50. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern indicates that for n from 1 to 50, the value of the expression is divisible by n!^n when (n^2)! is divisible by n!. Since factorial grows faster, the divisibility only holds for all n in that range. The set includes all n from 1 to 50, so the answer is the maximum element, 50.
