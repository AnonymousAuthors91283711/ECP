theorem omnimath939 (n : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) :
  ∏ k in Finset.range (n - 1), logb (n - k) (1 / (k + 2 : ℝ)) = omnimath939_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=2: product = -1.0
n=3: product = 1.0
n=4: product = -1.0
n=5: product = 0.9999999999999999
n=6: product = -0.9999999999999998. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℝ
The pattern alternates signs with each increasing n, and for n ≥ 3, the values approach ±1, with a slight numerical deviation. The pattern suggests the answer toggles between ±1, switching sign with each n, starting from -1 at n=2. Since the pattern is consistent, the closed form based on n's parity is:

If n is even, answer is -1; if odd, answer is 1.
