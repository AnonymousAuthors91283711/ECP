abbrev omnimath3445_answer : â„• := sorry
theorem omnimath3445 :
  IsLeast {n : â„• | 100 * 2^n > 10000 * (1/2)^n} omnimath3445_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 0: 2^(2*0) = 1
n = 1: 2^(2*1) = 4
n = 2: 2^(2*2) = 16
n = 3: 2^(2*3) = 64
n = 4: 2^(2*4) = 256
Answer: n = 4. Expected Answer Type: â„•
The inequality simplifies to 100 * 2^n > 10000 * (1/2)^n, equivalent to 2^{2n} > 100. The smallest n satisfying 2^{2n} > 100 is n = 4, since 2^{8} = 256 > 100, and 2^{6} = 64 < 100. The answer in Lean is therefore:

<<<4>>>
