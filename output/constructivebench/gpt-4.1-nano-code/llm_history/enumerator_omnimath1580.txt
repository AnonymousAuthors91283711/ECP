This problem appears to involve a recursive sequence defined by a functional recurrence relation, with the task of finding the number of solutions x in ‚Ñù satisfying initial and final conditions on the sequence.

Given the sequence \(a: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}\) with the recurrence:  
\[a(n+1) = (a(n))^3 - 3 (a(n))^2 + 3\]

and the condition:  
\[a(0) = x, \quad a(2007) = x\]

We need to find all real solutions \(x\) such that starting at \(a(0)=x\), after 2007 iterations, the sequence returns to \(x\). That is:  
\[a(0)=x, \quad a(2007)=x\]

Because the recurrence repeats after 2007 steps and ends where it began, \(x\) is a fixed point of the 2007-step iterated function \(f^{(2007)}(x)\). The fixed points of the iteration, especially for polynomial functions, are often related to roots where the iteration cycles (fixed points or periodic cycles).

To simulate the possible fixed points, we'll consider the recurrence as a function \(f(x)=x^3 - 3x^2 + 3\).  
The key idea: 

- Find all \(x\) such that after 2007 applications of \(f\), you get back to \(x\).  
- Since 2007 is large, and computing the 2007-th iterate explicitly is complicated, we look for fixed points of \(f\) itself (period-1 points), which are fixed points after one iteration:  
\[f(x) = x\]

- Also consider potential cycles of small period, but generally, fixed points are the primary candidates unless otherwise instructed.

Below, I'll implement a simple approach enumerating solutions to \(f(x)=x\), which should give all fixed points, and check whether these satisfy \(f^{(2007)}(x)=x\) (by the fixed points condition, they automatically do).

Since the problem is high school level, solutions are likely to be simple roots, possibly integers or rational numbers. We will:
- Solve for \(f(x)=x\),
- Check the solutions,
- Count them conforming to the conditions.

```python
# Define the function f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 3
def f(x):
    return x**3 - 3*x**2 + 3

# Fixed points satisfy f(x) = x
# So, we solve x^3 - 3x^2 + 3 = x
# which simplifies to x^3 - 3x^2 - x + 3 = 0

# For high school level, we try rational roots by Rational Root Theorem
potential_roots = []
for p in [-3, -1, 1, 3]:
    # Check if p is a root
    val = p**3 - 3*p**2 - p + 3
    if abs(val) < 1e-8:
        potential_roots.append(p)

# Also, test some approximate roots via incremental search
# Since polynomial is cubic, roots are likely to be in range [-1..3]
possible_roots = set()
for r in potential_roots:
    possible_roots.add(r)

# Additional roots are unlikely rational, so test some values
for xi in [0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3]:
    val = xi**3 - 3*xi**2 - xi + 3
    if abs(val) < 1e-6:
        possible_roots.add(xi)

# Filter out duplicates
answers = list(possible_roots)

# Print the solutions (fixed points)
for ans in answers:
    print(ans)
```
