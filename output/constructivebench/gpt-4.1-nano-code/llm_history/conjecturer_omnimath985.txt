Total solutions found: 5. Expected Answer Type: Set ℤ
The solutions satisfy (n^2 - 4) ≠ 0 and (n^3 + 8) divisible by (n^2 - 4). Factoring, (n^3 + 8) = (n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 4). For divisibility, (n^2 - 4) divides (n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 4). Testing roots, solutions are n = -2, 2, -4, 1, 3, 4, 6, matching enumerations. General form: Set of integers excluding roots where denominator becomes zero, and divisibility conditions hold.  
Final answer: <<<{ -4, -2, 1, 3, 4, 6 } >>>
