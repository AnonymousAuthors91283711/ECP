. Enumerated answers: Form: floor, f(1982) = 660
Form: ceil, f(1982) = 661
Form: adjusted_floor, f(1982) = 661
Possible f(1982): 661 (via ceil)
Possible f(1982): 661 (via adjusted_floor)
Possible f(1982): 660 (via floor). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests f(n) behaves near (n/3), with potential increments at certain n. The known values f(2)=0, f(3)>0, f(9999)=3333 imply f(n) ≈ n/3, with possible floor or ceiling adjustments. Since both floor and ceiling yield integers and 1982/3 ≈ 660.666…, the typical value aligns with the rounded down value, i.e., 660.
