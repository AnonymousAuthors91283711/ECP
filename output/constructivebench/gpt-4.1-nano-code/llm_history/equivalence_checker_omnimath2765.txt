abbrev omnimath2765_answer : ℚ → ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath2765 (n : ℚ) : 
  1/(2 * n) + 1/(4 * n) = 3/12 ↔ n = omnimath2765_answer 3 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n
Proposed Answer: fun _ => 3
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem states an equation: 1/(2n) + 1/(4n) = 3/12
2. Simplifying the left side: (2/4n + 1/4n) = 3/4n
3. The equation becomes: 3/4n = 3/12
4. Solving for n: 4n = 12 → n = 3

The ground truth answer (fun n => n) suggests the solution should return n itself, which doesn't make sense as a solution to the equation. The proposed answer (fun _ => 3) correctly gives the solution n=3 for any input (the function ignores its input and always returns 3, which is the correct solution).

However, the ground truth answer appears incorrect for this problem, while the proposed answer correctly solves the equation.
