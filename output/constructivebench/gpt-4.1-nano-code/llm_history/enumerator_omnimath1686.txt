The given Lean theorem is somewhat complex: it involves a quartic polynomial with four roots within a certain range [1/2, 2], and a specific expression involving these roots. To help in conjecturing and understanding the potential maximum value of that expression, I will enumerate candidate roots within [1/2, 2], test all possible combinations, and evaluate the expression.

To efficiently do this, I will:
- Select small sample points in [1/2, 2], such as 0.5, 1, and 2, to cover the domain.
- Generate all quadruples with these points.
- For each quadruple, compute the expression if the roots could be valid (though we won't verify if they are roots of the polynomial in this simplified enumeration).
- Output the maximum such value found.

This approach is approximate but will serve for conjecture purposes, respecting the instructions to print partial results immediately and not hardcode any specific answer.

```python
# Enumerate roots in the range [0.5, 2] with selected sample points
roots = [0.5, 1, 2]

max_value = float('-inf')
max_quad = None

# Generate all quadruples with replacement
for x1 in roots:
    for x2 in roots:
        for x3 in roots:
            for x4 in roots:
                # Compute the expression:
                # ((x1 + x2)*(x1 + x3)*x4) / ((x4 + x2)*(x4 + x3)*x1)
                numerator = (x1 + x2) * (x1 + x3) * x4
                denominator = (x4 + x2) * (x4 + x3) * x1
                # Avoid division by zero
                if denominator != 0:
                    r = numerator / denominator
                    print(r)
                    if r > max_value:
                        max_value = r
                        max_quad = (x1, x2, x3, x4)

print("Maximum value found:", max_value)
print("At quadruple:", max_quad)
```
