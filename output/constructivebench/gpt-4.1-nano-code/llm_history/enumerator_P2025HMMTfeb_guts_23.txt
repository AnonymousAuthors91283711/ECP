The problem appears to involve modular arithmetic with a function \(f\) (not explicitly defined here), and asks to find specific values or properties related to \(f(a)\), with some divisibility condition. Since the code references `sorry` and a non-computable abbreviation, the actual mathematical task is likely to analyze the behavior of \(f(a)\) under the given divisibility condition and resolve \(f(a+101)\) modulo \(101^2\).

Given that, I will generate a Python program that enumerates candidate values for \(a\) within a small range, based on the divisibility condition \((f(a) - 20) \mod (101^2) = 0\). I'll assume \(f(a)\) is an integer possibly linked to \(a\), and that the problem asks to infer \(f(a+101) \mod 101^2\). Since \(f\) isn't given explicitly, I will consider the simplest scenario: looking for integers \(a\) such that \(f(a) \equiv 20 \ (\bmod 10201)\), and then check how \(f(a+101)\) behaves.

This setup allows us to list candidate \(a\) values and their corresponding shifted values, printing solutions inline. To keep within token limit, I will:

- Sample \(a\) in a small range (say, 0 to 300)
- For each, check if the `(f a - 20) mod 10201 == 0`
- For each candidate, print the \(a\), \(f(a)\) (approximated) and compute \(f(a+101) \mod 10201\).

Since \(f\) is unspecified, I will assume \(f(a) = a\) to illustrate the enumeration process (you can adapt as needed).

```python
# Enumerate candidate values of a and corresponding f(a), assuming f(a) = a
# and checking the divisibility condition (f a - 20) % 10201 == 0.
# For each candidate, also compute and print f(a+101) % 10201.

MOD = 101**2  # 10201
max_a = 300  # sample range

for a in range(max_a):
    f_a = a  # placeholder for actual f(a)
    if (f_a - 20) % MOD == 0:
        f_a_plus_101 = a + 101  # assuming f(a) = a for simplicity
        result = f_a_plus_101 % MOD
        print(f"a={a}, f(a)={f_a}, f(a+101) mod {MOD}={result}")
```
