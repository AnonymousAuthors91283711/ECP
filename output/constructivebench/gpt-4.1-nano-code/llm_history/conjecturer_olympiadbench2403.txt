49. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The roots of \(f(n)\) are at \(x = \frac{-(2n - 1) \pm \sqrt{(2n - 1)^2 - 4(n^2 - 22)}}{2}\). Simplifying, the roots are real and distinct iff the discriminant is positive: \( (2n - 1)^2 - 4(n^2 - 22) > 0 \). This simplifies to \( 89 > 0 \), which is always true. Since the quadratic's roots are real and distinct iff the discriminant is positive, it's always positive for all \(n\). To have \(f(n)\) non-zero everywhere, we need the roots to be complex, which cannot happen under these circumstances. However, for \(f(n)\) to have no real roots, the condition reduces to \(n=23\).  
Answer expression: <<<23>>>
