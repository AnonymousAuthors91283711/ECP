The problem appears to involve determining the greatest lower bound (or supremum) of a specific set related to sums over natural numbers based on a condition involving \( x \in [0, 1) \), and particularly the sum of certain powers of 1/2 where indices depend on the floor of \( n \times x \). Given the complexity, let's analyze a representative value of \( x \), say \( x = 0.5 \), and examine the set \( S_x \).

- For \( x = 0.5 \), \( n \times x = 0.5 n \).
- \( \lfloor 0.5 n \rfloor \) is even iff \( n \) is divisible by 4.
- For all such \( n \), the sum over \( n \in S_x \) of \( 1/2^n \) sums over all multiples of 4: \( 4, 8, 12, \dots \).

Let's generate these sums for a few values to approximate the supremum.

```python
# Enumerate sums over n where n is a multiple of 4
# for n from 4 up to 100, sum terms 1/2^n
max_n = 100
results = []

for n in range(4, max_n + 1):
    sum_value = 0.0
    for multiple in range(4, n + 1, 4):
        sum_value += 1 / (2 ** multiple)
    print(f'Partial sum up to n={n} (multiples of 4): {sum_value}')
    results.append(sum_value)
# The partial sums approach a limit; the total sum over all multiples of 4 is less than 1/3
total_sum = sum(1 / (2 ** m) for m in range(4, 10**6, 4))
print(f'Total sum over all multiples of 4: {total_sum}')
# Since the sum converges, the supremum of the sum over all x in [0,1) is approaching this value, which is less than 1/3
# For the purposes of the original problem, we can approximate that the greatest lower bound L is around 0.25
# but more precise bounds depend on the exact set definitions.
