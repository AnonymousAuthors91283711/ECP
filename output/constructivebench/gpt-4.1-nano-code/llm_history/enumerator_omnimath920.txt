This problem appears to involve identifying specific natural numbers related to a certain condition, with the set containing exactly 4 elements: 153, 370, 371, and 407. These numbers are known as Armstrong numbers (narcissistic numbers), which are equal to the sum of their own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

The task is to find all such numbers, or the set of all Armstrong numbers of a certain digit length, and confirm that the given set matches those numbers. Since the problem is high school level, and the known Armstrong numbers with 3 digits are exactly 153, 370, 371, and 407, it is reasonable to enumerate all three-digit Armstrong numbers.

To assist in conjecturing and verifying the answer, the code will generate all 3-digit numbers, check whether each number equals the sum of its digits raised to the power of 3, and print all such numbers immediately when found.

```python
# Enumerate all three-digit numbers to find Armstrong numbers
for n in range(100, 1000):
    digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]
    sum_of_powers = sum(d ** 3 for d in digits)
    if n == sum_of_powers:
        print(n)
```
