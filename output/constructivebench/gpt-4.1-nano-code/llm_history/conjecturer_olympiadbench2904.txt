A * B * 10000 = 44.44444444444444. Expected Answer Type: ℚ × ℚ → ℚ
The error occurs because in the current answer, (A + B) * 1000, the variables A and B are not in scope; they are only parameters of the theorem, not directly accessible in the definition. To fix this, the answer must be expressed as a lambda (anonymous function) that takes a pair (A, B) as input, matching the type ℚ × ℚ → ℚ.

From the enumerated answers, the key value corresponding to (A + B) * 1000 is approximately 151.11111111111111. Therefore, the correct approach is to define the answer as a function that extracts A and B from the input pair and computes (A + B) * 1000.

Conjecture:
Given the problem's structure and the pattern, the general form should be:
fun p : ℚ × ℚ => (p.1 + p.2) * 1000

This fixes scope issues and aligns with the enumerated value.

<<<fun p : ℚ × ℚ => (p.1 + p.2) * 1000>>>

This is a closed-form answer, correctly generalized and in line with the enumerated data.
