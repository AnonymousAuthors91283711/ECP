The problem involves solving the equation involving nested square roots and determining the value of \(x\). The equation is:

\[
\sqrt{(3 - x)(4 - x)} + \sqrt{(4 - x)(6 - x)} + \sqrt{(6 - x)(3 - x)} = x,
\]
with the constraint \(x < 3\).

To assist, we will:
- Examine potential structure or symmetry in the roots.
- Enumerate possible solutions numerically within a feasible interval.
- Check for solutions where all radicands are non-negative.
- Demo the solutions for close approximations.

We'll limit enumeration to a reasonable interval, say from \(-10\) to \(3\), with small steps. We'll derive approximate solutions, then verify solutions near these candidates.

```python
import math

# Define the function from the equation
def f(x):
    # Compute each sqrt, ensure non-negativity
    term1 = (3 - x) * (4 - x)
    term2 = (4 - x) * (6 - x)
    term3 = (6 - x) * (3 - x)
    if min(term1, term2, term3) < 0:
        return None
    return math.sqrt(term1) + math.sqrt(term2) + math.sqrt(term3)

# Search interval and step size
start, end, step = -10, 3, 0.001

# Store approximate solutions
solutions = []

x = start
while x <= end:
    val = f(x)
    if val is not None:
        if abs(val - x) < 0.01:  # tolerance for solution
            solutions.append(round(x, 4))
            print(f"Approximate solution near x = {x:.4f}")
    x += step

# To verify solutions near candidates and provide more precise solutions, 
# check each candidate with increased precision
for candidate in set(solutions):
    # Refine solution using smaller step or root-finding methods if needed
    print(f"Potential solution at x â‰ˆ {candidate}")
```
