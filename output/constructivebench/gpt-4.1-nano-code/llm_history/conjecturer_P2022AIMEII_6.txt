theorem P2022AIMEII_6 :
  IsGreatest {d : ℚ | ∃ (x : Fin 100 → ℚ),
    (∀ i j : Fin 100, i ≤ j → x i ≤ x j) ∧
    ∑ i, |x i| = 1 ∧
    ∑ i, x i = 0 ∧
    d = x 75 - x 15}  -- Note: Lean uses 0-based indexing, so x_{76} is x 75 and x_{16} is x 15
  P2022AIMEII_6_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Maximum difference found: None. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Since the sum of the x i's is zero and the absolute sum is 1, the maximum difference x_{75} - x_{15} occurs when x_{75} = 1 and x_{15} = -1, with all other entries set to 0 to satisfy constraints. Thus, the maximal difference is 2.
