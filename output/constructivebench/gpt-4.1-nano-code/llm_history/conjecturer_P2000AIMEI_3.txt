theorem P2000AIMEI_3 :
  ∃! (ab : ℕ × ℕ), 0 < ab.1 ∧ 0 < ab.2 ∧ ab.1.Coprime ab.2 ∧
  (choose 2000 2) * ab.1^1998 * ab.2^2 = (choose 2000 3) * ab.1^1997 * ab.2^3 ∧
  ab.1 + ab.2 = P2000AIMEI_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The key equation relates binomial coefficients and powers, suggesting that the ratio (ab.2/ab.1) is constant. Solving (choose 2000 2) * x^1998 * y^2 = (choose 2000 3) * x^1997 * y^3 yields y/x = 2. Since coprime and positive, minimal coprime pair is (1, 2). Sum is 3.
