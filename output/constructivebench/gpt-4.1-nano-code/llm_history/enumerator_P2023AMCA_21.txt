[write_program]
This problem involves combinatorial enumeration related to the icosahedron graph, specifically counting certain triples with distance conditions. Since the problem is about ratios of counts, we want to precisely evaluate the numerator and denominator based on the graph's structure and the constraints.

To approach this, the program enumerates all valid triples satisfying the constraints. The core challenge is the combinatorial filtering based on the distances, so the code iterates over all triples in the universe, applies the constraints, computes distances, and tallies the numerator and denominator counts.

The key points:
- We don't hardcode the distance function (`d`); instead, we derive it from the icosahedron graph.
- The icosahedron graph has 12 vertices; explicit adjacency is manageable.
- We directly generate all triples, filter, compute distances, and count.
- We print the ratio to help in conjecture, which can be simplified later.

Below is the Python code implementing this enumeration:

```python
# Enumeration for the icosahedron graph vertices
import itertools

# Vertices labeled 0 through 11
vertices = list(range(12))

# Edges of the icosahedron graph (adjacency list)
edges = [
    (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6),
    (1, 2), (1, 7), (1, 8),
    (2, 3), (2, 9),
    (3, 4), (3, 10),
    (4, 5), (4, 11),
    (5, 6),
    (6, 7),
    (7, 8),
    (8, 9),
    (9, 10),
    (10, 11),
    (11, 4)
]

# Build adjacency list
adj = {v: set() for v in vertices}
for u, v in edges:
    adj[u].add(v)
    adj[v].add(u)

# Function to compute shortest path length between two vertices in the icosahedron
def dist(a, b):
    if a == b:
        return 0
    # BFS for shortest path
    from collections import deque
    queue = deque([(a, 0)])
    visited = {a}
    while queue:
        current, d = queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in adj[current]:
            if neighbor == b:
                return d + 1
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, d + 1))
    return float('inf')  # Should never happen in connected graph

# Enumerate all triples p = (p1, p2, p3)
total_denominator = 0
total_numerator = 0

for p1 in vertices:
    for p2 in vertices:
        for p3 in vertices:
            # Apply the constraints: all p1, p2, p3 are distinct
            if p1 != p2 and p2 != p3 and p1 != p3:
                # Following the problem's constraints:
                # p1 ≠ p2.1 (p2.1 is p2), p2.1 ≠ p2.2 (not applicable here), p1 ≠ p2.2 (which is p3?)
                # Here, considering the notation:
                # p = (p.1, p.2.1, p.2.2), so in our triple p = (p1, p2, p3)
                # The constraints are: p1 ≠ p2 and p1 ≠ p3 and p2 ≠ p3
                # (Since the problem specifies p.1 ≠ p.2.1 etc., interpreted as all three are distinct)
                pass
            else:
                continue

            # Check distance condition for numerator calculation
            d1 = dist(p1, p2)
            d2 = dist(p2, p3)
            # Only if p1 ≠ p2, p2 ≠ p3, p1 ≠ p3, etc., as above.
            # Count total (denominator)
            total_denominator += 1
            if d1 > d2:
                total_numerator += 1
                print(f"Triple: ({p1}, {p2}, {p3}), distances: {d1} > {d2}")

ratio = total_numerator / total_denominator if total_denominator > 0 else 0
print(f"Approximate ratio: {ratio}")
```
