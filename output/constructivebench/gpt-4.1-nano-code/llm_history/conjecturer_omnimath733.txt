The constraints imply n's digit sum is twice the number of digits, and digit parity matches index parity. For sum to be twice length, all digits are likely 1, satisfying sum = 2 * length. The last digit sum condition and even index parity point to n being a repdigit with all 1s, and the last digit being 1, making n a sum of ones. Given the divisibility by 210 (2*3*5*7), n must be divisible by these primes, which is consistent with numbers like 111111111111.

The error in the proposed answer stems from the use of a comma within the logical conjunctions. In Lean, when defining logical conjunctions, we should use `∧` without commas, and each condition should be an individual expression. The specific problematic part is `(digits 10 n).all (λ d, d = 1) , n % 2 = 0`—which erroneously includes a comma.

From the enumerated answers and the problem's conditions, the key features are:
- The number `n` is divisible by 210 (since `(n+1) % 210 = 0`, implying `n ≡ -1 mod 210`, but the solution focuses on divisibility conditions)
- The sum of digits equals twice the number of digits
- Digits are all 1's (or at least consistent with the parity condition on indices)
- `n` is even (based on the parity of digit indices).

Given the constraints—especially `digits 10 n).sum = 2 * (digits 10 n).length` and the evenness conditions—the most natural candidate is numbers with all digits equal to 1 or 2, and divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 7, possibly implying divisibility by 210.

Reflecting on the pattern, an intersection of numbers divisible by 210 and having all digits equal to 1 (which would satisfy the parity condition across digit positions) fits well.

Here's the corrected, simplified, and general form answer in Lean:

<<<{ n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (digits 10 n).sum = 2 * (digits 10 n).length ∧ (digits 10 n).all (λ d, d = 1) ∧ n % 2 = 0 ∧ n % 3 = 0 ∧ n % 5 = 0 ∧ n % 7 = 0 }>>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
