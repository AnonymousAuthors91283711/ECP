theorem P2006AIMEI_3 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∃ (d : ℕ) (k : ℕ), d ∈ digits 10 n ∧ k = n - d * 10^(List.length (digits 10 n) - 1) ∧ k = n / 29} 
  P2006AIMEI_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 725. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem involves the least n > 0 satisfying a certain relation with digits and division by 29, with the answer 725 appearing as the minimal value satisfying these conditions. The pattern suggests the answer is a specific constant number deriving from properties of the digits and division constraints aligned with 29. Thus, the answer is the constant 725, expressed generally as that specific number.
