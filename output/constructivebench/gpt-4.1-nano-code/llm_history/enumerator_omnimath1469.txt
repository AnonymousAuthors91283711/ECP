The problem seems to involve pairs of natural numbers `(p₁, p₂)` within certain bounds, satisfying an equation involving division and multiplication, and with constraints `0 < p₁ < p₂` related to 2020. Since the problem source isn't entirely standard Python, I'll interpret the constraints and do an enumeration of candidate pairs `(p₁, p₂)` within plausible small ranges to find solutions satisfying the equation.  
Given the size of 2020, to make the enumeration manageable, I'll choose small ranges around some divisors and systematically test pairs fitting the inequalities and the equation.  
We seek pairs `(p₁, p₂)` with `0 < p₁ < p₂` and satisfy:

\[
\left(\frac{2020 - p_1}{p_1}\right) \times \left(\frac{2020 - p_2}{p_2}\right) = 2
\]

We'll iterate over plausible small `p₁` and `p₂` values, check the conditions, and print matching solutions.

```python
# Enumerate candidate pairs (p1, p2) with 0 < p1 < p2 <= 2020
# Check the equation: ((2020 - p1)/p1) * ((2020 - p2)/p2) == 2
# To avoid division by zero, skip p1 or p2 == 0
for p1 in range(1, 2021):  # p1 from 1 to 2020
    for p2 in range(p1 + 1, 2021):  # p2 > p1
        numerator1 = 2020 - p1
        numerator2 = 2020 - p2
        # Check if p divides in the division cleanly or if division yields an exact result
        # But since we're looking for exact solutions, perform floating check or integer check
        val1 = numerator1 / p1
        if numerator1 % p1 != 0:
            continue
        val2 = numerator2 / p2
        if numerator2 % p2 != 0:
            continue
        product = val1 * val2
        # Check if product equals 2 exactly
        if abs(product - 2) < 1e-9:
            print(f'p1 = {p1}, p2 = {p2}')
```

The problem involves finding a unique pair of natural numbers \( (p_1, p_2) \) with specific inequalities and an exact product condition involving division. The program correctly enumerates candidate pairs in the specified ranges, avoiding division by zero, and checks for integer divisibility before performing floating-point comparisons. However, relying solely on integer division and an approximate equality check (`abs(product - 2) < 1e-9`) can cause problems because the exact solutions may involve rational numbers, not necessarily integers division, and the check may miss solutions due to floating-point precision issues.

Moreover, the problem's defining equation involves rational expressions, so the best approach is to work with exact rational arithmetic rather than floating-point comparisons. Since the code currently strictly requires the divisions to be exact (via the `%` check), it may overlook solutions where the division yields a rational number, not an integer, but the product yields exactly 2.

Given that the original code outputs nothing, it suggests no solutions satisfy strict integer division. However, the problem involves equality of products of rational expressions, which should be checked exactly rather than via floating-point approximations. To accurately identify solutions, we should work with rational numbers and check the equality exactly.

**Judgement:**
The code as written performs integer division and strict modular checks, which may be too restrictive, possibly leading to no solutions found. Since the problem's condition involves fractions, the implementation should use rational arithmetic for exactness.

**Acceptance:**
<<<False>>>

**Correction:**
```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate candidate pairs (p1, p2) with 0 < p1 < p2 <= 2020
for p1 in range(1, 2021):
    for p2 in range(p1 + 1, 2021):
        numerator1 = 2020 - p1
        numerator2 = 2020 - p2
        # Use rational arithmetic for exact calculation
        val1 = Fraction(numerator1, p1)
        val2 = Fraction(numerator2, p2)
        product = val1 * val2
        if product == 2:
            print(f'p1 = {p1}, p2 = {p2}')
```
