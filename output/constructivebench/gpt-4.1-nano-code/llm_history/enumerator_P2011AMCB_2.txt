This problem asks us to find the least value of \( x \) such that the average of six scores (which include \( x \)) is at least 3 points higher than the average of five scores. The five known scores are 90, 80, 70, 60, and 85, and we include an unknown \( x \) to find the minimum satisfying value.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Calculate the average of the five scores.
- Set up the inequality for the six scores with the unknown \( x \).
- Solve the inequality for \( x \).
- Enumerate possible \( x \) values starting from the lowest plausible integer (since scores are typically integers) upwards until the inequality is satisfied.

Assuming scores are non-negative integers:

```python
# Enumerate possible x starting from 0 until the condition is met
scores = [90, 80, 70, 60, 85]
sum_scores = sum(scores)
avg_five = sum_scores / 5
target_diff = 3

x = 0
while True:
    # Compute the average of the 6 scores including x
    avg_six = (sum_scores + x) / 6
    # Check if the average is at least 3 greater than average of five scores
    if avg_six >= avg_five + target_diff:
        print(x)
        break
    x += 1
```
