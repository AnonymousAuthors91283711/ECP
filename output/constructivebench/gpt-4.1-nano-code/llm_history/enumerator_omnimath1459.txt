The problem appears to involve finding the minimal possible absolute value of \( P(0) \) among all polynomials \( P \) with integer coefficients such that \( P(-10) = 145 \) and \( P(9) = 164 \). We need to enumerate possible values of \( P(0) \) that satisfy these boundary conditions, aiming to find the least absolute value.

Key insight:
- The difference \( P(9) - P(-10) = 164 - 145 = 19 \).
- The polynomial's values at \( -10 \) and \( 9 \) differ by 19, and \( P(0) \) is some value we're optimizing.
- For integrally coefficiented polynomial \( P \), it can be constructed using Lagrange interpolation or differences.

Approach:
- Use Lagrange interpolation based on the points \(-10, 145\) and \(9, 164\). The polynomial passing through these two points can be expressed explicitly:
  
  \( P(x) = A(x + 10)(x - 9) + Bx + C \),

  but since only these two points are fixed, the polynomial is not uniquely determined unless constrained further.  
- However, the problem asks for the minimal absolute value at \( P(0) \) while satisfying these boundary conditions with integer \( P \).

- The differences in the points suggest the possibility of constructing \( P \) as a quadratic with an adjustable middle term, or perhaps linear.

Given the constraints, the simplest assumption:

Construct \( P(x) \) as linear (since only two points are fixed), with \( P(x) = mx + b \).  
Use the two points:

- \( P(-10) = -10m + b = 145 \),
- \( P(9) = 9m + b = 164 \).

Subtract:

\( (9m + b) - (-10m + b) = 164 - 145 \Rightarrow 19m = 19 \Rightarrow m = 1 \).

Plug back:

\( -10(1) + b = 145 \Rightarrow -10 + b = 145 \Rightarrow b = 155 \).

So, candidate polynomial:

\( P(x) = x + 155 \).

At \( x=0 \):

\( P(0) = 155 \).

Now, suppose we consider other polynomials, especially involving higher degrees, to possibly reduce \( |P(0)| \). Since the coefficients are integers, any polynomial satisfying the boundary conditions participates.

Given the minimal polynomial is the linear one, and the difference in evaluations is fixed, the minimal \( |P(0)| \) should be 155.

But, perhaps the polynomial can be modified by adding a multiple of \( (x+10)(x-9) \). Because adding such a multiple will not change the functions' values at \(-10\) and \(9\) (since it vanishes at these points), but may affect \( P(0) \).

- Adding \( k(x+10)(x-9) \) with integer \( k \), the polynomial becomes:

  \( P_k(x) = x + 155 + k(x+10)(x-9) \).

- Evaluated at 0:

  \( P_k(0) = 155 + k(10)(-9) = 155 - 90k \).

- To minimize \( |P(0)| \), choose \( k \) so that \( P(0) \) is closest to zero. Since \( P(0) \) is \( 155 - 90k \), this is minimized when \( 90k \) is close to 155.

- Find \( k \) is integer:

  
  \( 90k \approx 155 \Rightarrow k \approx 1.72 \).

- Possible integer \( k \):

  \( k = 1 \Rightarrow P(0) = 155 - 90 = 65 \), \( |65| = 65 \).

  \( k = 2 \Rightarrow P(0) = 155 - 180 = -25 \), \( |-25| = 25 \).

  \( k = 3 \Rightarrow P(0) = 155 - 270 = -115 \).

  \( k = 0 \Rightarrow P(0) = 155 \).

Check negative \( k = 1 \), \( 2 \), ... for values closer to zero:

- \( k=-1 \Rightarrow P(0) = 155 + 90 = 245 \),
- \( k=-2 \Rightarrow P(0) = 155 + 180 = 335 \),
- etc.

From these, the minimal \( |P(0)| \) is 25 at \( k=2 \).

Thus, minimal absolute value is 25, achievable with \( k=2 \). The corresponding polynomial:

\[ P(x) = x + 155 + 2(x+10)(x-9) \].

We probably only consider the minimal absolute value in the answer.

Below is a Python script enumerating possible \( P(0) \) values of the form:

\[ P(0) = 155 - 90k, \quad k \in \mathbb{Z} \].

We will check \( |P(0)| \) for \( k \) within a certain range (say from -3 to 4), to find the minimal absolute value, then output all candidates.

```python
# Enumerate k values to find minimal |P(0)| and candidates
min_abs_value = None
candidates = []

for k in range(-3, 4):
    P0 = 155 - 90 * k
    abs_P0 = abs(P0)
    print(f"k={k}, P(0)={P0}")
    if min_abs_value is None or abs_P0 < min_abs_value:
        min_abs_value = abs_P0
    candidates.append((P0, abs_P0))

# Output minimal absolute value candidate(s)
print(f"Minimal |P(0)| found: {min_abs_value}")
min_candidates = [P0 for P0, abs_val in candidates if abs_val == min_abs_value]
print(f"Candidates with minimal |P(0)|={min_abs_value}: {min_candidates}")
```
