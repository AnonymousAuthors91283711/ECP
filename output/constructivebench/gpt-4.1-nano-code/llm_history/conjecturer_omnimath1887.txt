theorem omnimath1887 :
  ∃ (h p z : ℕ),
    2 * h + 3 * p + 6 * z = 800 ∧
    8 * h + 9 * p + 12 * z = 2018 ∧
    h + p + z = omnimath1887_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: h=1, p=138, z=64, total=203. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The given system of equations suggests a linear combination leading to the total sum (h + p + z). By solving the equations, the total sum simplifies to 203. Therefore, the solution is independent of the individual values, directly giving the total sum.

<<<203>>>
