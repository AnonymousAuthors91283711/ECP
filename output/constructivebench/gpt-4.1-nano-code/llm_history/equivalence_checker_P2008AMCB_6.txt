Ground Truth Answer: 2500
Proposed Answer: 2472
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem calculates total steps (44 * 100000 + 50000 = 4,450,000 steps)
2. It converts steps to miles by dividing by 1800 steps/mile
3. 4,450,000 / 1800 ≈ 2472.222...
4. The theorem states we need to find the integer m that minimizes |distance - m|
5. The closest integer to 2472.222... is 2472 (distance is 0.222... vs 2473 would be 0.777...)

The ground truth answer claims 2500, which is clearly farther from the actual distance (difference of ~27.777) compared to 2472 (difference of ~0.222).

The proposed answer 2472 is mathematically correct as it's the closest integer to the calculated distance. The ground truth answer of 2500 is incorrect.
