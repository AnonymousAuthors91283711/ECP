  2017 ≤ Nat.card {s : Multiset ℕ | s.card = 2017 ∧ (∀ x ∈ s, ∃ k, x = k^2) ∧ s.sum = n} := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Sum with all zeros: 0
Sum with all ones: 2017
Sum with 1008 fours and rest zeros: 4032
Sum with all 16s: 32272
Sum with 10 nines and rest zeros: 90
Sum with 1000 ones and 1000 fours: 5000. Expected Answer Type: Prop
The pattern involves sums of squares; minimal sum when all zero is 0, then all ones = 2017, then mixtures like 16s (smallest squares for a large sum), and large nines. The simplest non-zero sum is with all ones, sum = 2017, which is both minimal and straightforward.
