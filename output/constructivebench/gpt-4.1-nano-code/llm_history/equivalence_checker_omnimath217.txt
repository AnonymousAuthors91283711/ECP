open Set Function Nat

abbrev omnimath217_answer : ℕ × Bool → Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath217 (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) :

Ground Truth Answer: fun (n, part_i) => 
    if part_i then 
      ∃ (S : Finset ℕ), S.card = n ∧ (∀ t ⊆ S, t.Nonempty → ∃ k : ℕ, (∏ x ∈ t, x) = k ^ t.card)
    else 
      ¬∃ (S : Set ℕ), S.Infinite ∧ (∀ (t : Finset ℕ), t.Nonempty → (∀ x ∈ t, x ∈ S) → ∃ k : ℕ, (∏ x ∈ t, x) = k ^ t.card)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ × Bool => (n.1 = 0 ∧ n.2 = false) ∨ (n.1 > 0 ∧ n.2 = true)
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. The ground truth answer defines a proposition that:
   - For (n, true): There exists a finite set S of natural numbers with cardinality n where every nonempty subset has a product that's a perfect power
   - For (0, false): There is no infinite set of natural numbers where every finite nonempty subset has a product that's a perfect power

2. The proposed answer simply states a condition about the input pair:
   - Either (0, false) is true
   - Or (positive n, true) is true

The proposed answer is just describing the input pattern that would make the function true, while the ground truth answer provides the actual mathematical conditions that must be satisfied. They are not equivalent - the proposed answer doesn't capture the mathematical content of the problem at all.
