The problem appears to be about exact rational calculations involving the sum \(1/3 + 1/6 + 1/4\), then subtracting this sum from 1, and asserting a unique value for this expression.

Given the structure, the main goal is to compute \(1 - (1/3 + 1/6 + 1/4)\) exactly, and confirm that this value is unique in the rationals.

Let's proceed step-by-step:
- Compute the sum \(1/3 + 1/6 + 1/4\) as a rational number.
- Subtract that sum from 1.
- Assign that result to `omnimath3501_answer`.
- Proceed to check for uniqueness (though trivial here).

No need for brute-force enumeration here since the values are fixed and rational.

Therefore, I will:
- Calculate the exact sum as a rational.
- Output the resulting rational value, ensuring it's in simplest form.
- Since the actual justification is straightforward, the code reflects this calculation.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Calculate the sum of the fractions exactly
sum_fractions = Fraction(1,3) + Fraction(1,6) + Fraction(1,4)

# Compute the answer: 1 - sum of fractions
omnimath3501_answer = Fraction(1,1) - sum_fractions

# Print the answer immediately
print(omnimath3501_answer)

# Theorem statement (simulated)
# In a real proof, we'd assert that this is the unique such rational
# but here, we just output the value
# Since the problem's structure is about exact computation, this suffices.
```
