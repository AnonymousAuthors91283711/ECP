This problem appears to involve combinatorics with specific constraints on black and white "pieces" placed on an 8x8 grid, with conditions on their rows and columns, and a goal to find the maximum possible number of white pieces (variable k). To enumerate the possible values for k, I will:

- Fix small sample values for black and white positions satisfying the constraints.
- Use combinatorial enumeration to find all feasible configurations for each value of k, from the lower bounds up to some upper threshold.
- Output all possible k values that fit the constraints, prioritizing the maximum k found.

Given the constraints:
- black has 6 pieces with distinct rows and columns (a permutation of size 6).
- white has k pieces with distinct rows and columns (a permutation of size k).
- each black piece intersects with white on either same row or same column.
- black pieces are all in different rows and columns.
- same for white pieces.

The maximum k occurs when each white piece intersects with some black piece in their row or column. Since black occupies 6 distinct rows and columns, for each white piece to intersect, it must share a row or column with some black piece.

The key insight:
- The maximum number of white pieces k is limited by the black pieces' locations, i.e., cannot exceed the number of black pieces (6), since each white must intersect with at least one black in row or column.

Thus, k can range from 0 up to 6. To illustrate this, I will generate all possibilities for small values of k from 0 to 6, test the existences, and output all feasible k's.

Here's the code:

```python
import itertools

def can_place_white(black_positions, k):
    # black_positions: list of 6 (row, col)
    # For each white piece, choose a row and column not occupied by white yet, 
    # such that it intersects with at least one black in row or column.
    black_rows = {b[0] for b in black_positions}
    black_cols = {b[1] for b in black_positions}
    
    # Generate all possible white positions with k distinct positions,
    # in different rows and columns, intersecting black.
    # For simplicity, try all permutations of available rows and columns.
    for white_rows in itertools.permutations(range(8), k):
        for white_cols in itertools.permutations(range(8), k):
            white_positions = list(zip(white_rows, white_cols))
            # Check each white piece intersects with black
            if all(any(b[0]==w[0] or b[1]==w[1] for b in black_positions) for w in white_positions):
                return True
    return False

feasible_ks = []
# Iterate over all possible black configurations with 6 black pieces
for black_positions in itertools.combinations(itertools.product(range(8), repeat=2), 6):
    # Check if black positions have all distinct rows and columns (permutation)
    rows = [b[0] for b in black_positions]
    cols = [b[1] for b in black_positions]
    if len(set(rows)) != 6 or len(set(cols)) != 6:
        continue
    # Try k from 0 to 6
    for k in range(7):
        if can_place_white(black_positions, k):
            if k not in feasible_ks:
                print(f"Feasible white count k={k} with black positions={black_positions}")
            if k == 6:
                # maximum reached
                break
    # Early stop if k=6 feasible for any black configuration
    if 6 in feasible_ks:
        break
```
