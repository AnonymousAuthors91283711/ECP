theorem omnimath3440 : 
  IsLeast {d : ℝ | ∃ x ∈ ({11/10, 111/100, 1.101, 1111/1000, 1.011} : Set ℝ), d = |x - 1|} 
          |omnimath3440_answer - 1| := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x = 1.1, |x - 1| = 0.10000000000000009
x = 1.11, |x - 1| = 0.1100000000000001
x = 1.101, |x - 1| = 0.10099999999999998
x = 1.111, |x - 1| = 0.11099999999999999
x = 1.011, |x - 1| = 0.010999999999999899
Least |x - 1| is 0.010999999999999899
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<0.011>>>

Explanation: The minimal |x - 1| is achieved at x = 1.011, with |x - 1| ≈ 0.011, being the smallest among the given options.
