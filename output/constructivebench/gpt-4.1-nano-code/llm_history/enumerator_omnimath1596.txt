This problem is formulated in Lean theorem proving language but appears to involve understanding a functional equation and constructing a candidate solution. The key is to interpret the functional equation and then, perhaps, guess the form of \(f\).

Since the problem involves a functional equation with constraints, we can try to analyze it step-by-step:

- The functional equation:
  \[
  f((c+1) x + f y) = f(x + 2 y) + 2 c x
  \]
  holds for positive \(x,y\).

- Constraints:
  - \(c > 0\),
  - \(f\) is positive for positive arguments.

To assist in conjecturing the specific form of \(f\), I will test specific values for \(x, y\) and \(c\):

- Try simple parameters, e.g., \(c=1\).
- Assume \(f\) is linear: \(f(x) = m x + b\).
- Given the positivity constraints, choose small positive parameters, e.g., \(c=1\), \(x=1\), \(y=1\).

The idea is to generate candidate functions \(f\) that satisfy the functional equation for various parameters.

Here is a Python code to iterate over small candidate functions and parameters, test their validity, and output solutions.

```python
import math

# Explore possible linear functions f(x) = m*x + b with positive outputs for x>0
# Set small ranges for m and b
for m_num in range(1, 5):
    for b_num in range(0, 3):
        m = m_num * 0.5  # m in {0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0}
        b = b_num * 0.5  # b in {0.0, 0.5, 1.0}
        def f(x):
            return m * x + b

        # Test for c in small set
        for c in [0.5, 1.0, 1.5]:
            # Test over positive x,y values
            test_passed = True
            for x_val in [0.1, 1.0, 2.0]:
                for y_val in [0.1, 1.0, 2.0]:
                    lhs = f((c + 1) * x_val + f(y_val))
                    rhs = f(x_val + 2 * y_val) + 2 * c * x_val
                    # Check approximate equality within tolerance
                    if not math.isclose(lhs, rhs, rel_tol=1e-6):
                        test_passed = False
                        break
                if not test_passed:
                    break
            if test_passed:
                print(f"Candidate f(x) = {m} * x + {b} for c={c} satisfies the functional equation.")
                print(f"\tAt x,y=1,1: lhs={lhs}, rhs={rhs}")
```

This code searches over small parameter ranges for linear functions \(f\), verifies whether they satisfy the functional equation for small positive \(x, y\), and prints candidates accordingly.

Executing it would generate concrete functions likely to satisfy the equation, helping to conjecture the form of \(f\).

```python
import math

# Search for linear solutions f(x) = m*x + b with positive outputs for x>0
for m_num in range(1, 5):
    for b_num in range(0, 3):
        m = m_num * 0.5  # m in {0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0}
        b = b_num * 0.5  # b in {0.0, 0.5, 1.0}
        def f(x):
            return m * x + b

        # Test for c in small set
        for c in [0.5, 1.0, 1.5]:
            # Test over small positive x,y
            test_passed = True
            for x_val in [0.1, 1.0, 2.0]:
                for y_val in [0.1, 1.0, 2.0]:
                    lhs = f((c + 1) * x_val + f(y_val))
                    rhs = f(x_val + 2 * y_val) + 2 * c * x_val
                    if not math.isclose(lhs, rhs, rel_tol=1e-6):
                        test_passed = False
                        break
                if not test_passed:
                    break
            if test_passed:
                print(f"Candidate f(x) = {m} * x + {b} satisfies the functional equation for c={c}.")
                print(f"\tTest at x=y=1: lhs={lhs}, rhs={rhs}")
```
