. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
The error in the given code is due to the use of a comma ',' instead of '=>'. In Lean, lambda expressions (anonymous functions) are written with '=>' rather than ','. The proposed answer is a constant π (pi), which corresponds to the observed ratio close to π from the enumerations.

Based on the problem details and observed ratios, the ratio log(b)/log(a) seems to be constant and equal to π, as indicated by the enumerations. Given the equation: \( 2 \pi \log(a^2) = \log(b^4) \), simplifying yields \( 2 \pi \cdot 2 \log a = 4 \log b \). This reduces to \( 4 \pi \log a = 4 \log b \), or \( \pi \log a = \log b \), leading to \( b = a^{\pi} \). Therefore, the ratio log b / log a is π.

The fix involves replacing 'λ a b, π' with 'λ a b, π' (using '=>' instead of ',').

The final answer, in closed form, is simply the constant π.

<<< fun a b => π>>>
