The problem appears to relate to a combinatorial sum involving floor functions and a potential formula involving \( n^2(n - 1)/4 \). The goal is to find all possible values of \( n \) that satisfy the equation in a way consistent with the sum, possibly to conjecture or prove a specific relationship.

Given the problem, I'll evaluate small values of \( n \) (say from 1 to 20) for the sum, compare it to the formula, and output parameter values for which the equality holds.

```python
# Enumerate small n values to check the sum against the formula n^2*(n-1)/4
from math import floor

# Set the maximum n to check
max_n = 20

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            numerator = (i + 1) * (j + 1)
            denominator = n + 1
            total_sum += floor(numerator / denominator)
    # Compute the expected value
    expected = n**2 * (n - 1) / 4
    # Check if sum matches the formula
    if total_sum == expected:
        print(f"n = {n} satisfies the sum condition with sum = {total_sum}")
```
