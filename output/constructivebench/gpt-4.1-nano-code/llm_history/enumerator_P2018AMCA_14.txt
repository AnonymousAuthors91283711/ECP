The problem appears to involve an equation with logarithms and parameters, where the answer is not given explicitly but is likely related to solving an equation involving logs. To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will generate candidate solutions for \(x\) based on the given constraints and the form of the equation:

\[
\log_b(3x) = \log_b(2x)
\]
or related transformations involving base conversions, with parameters set for small, manageable values. Since the code snippet hints at a rational answer and no input is provided, I will:
- Pick small rational \(x\) candidates that satisfy positivity.
- Check the equality \(\log_b (3x) 4 = \log_b (2x) 8\) by reformulating.
- List solutions if any.

Given the nature of the problem (as a math competition question), enumerating candidates can help identify the correct form for \(x\). Afterwards, we can observe patterns that might lead to a formal proof.

```python
# Trying small positive rational candidates for x
# Since the logs are base-b, the algebra suggests examining where logs' arguments are positive and the equality holds.
# Logarithmic equality conditions can be transformed into algebraic equations.

candidates = []
for numerator in range(1, 10):
    for denominator in range(1, 10):
        x = numerator / denominator
        if x > 0:
            candidates.append(x)

def check_equation(x):
    # We want to check if log_b(3x) * 4 == log_b(2x) * 8
    # Using change of base: log_b(y) = log(y) / log(b)
    # The equality becomes:
    # (log(3x) / log(b)) * 4 == (log(2x) / log(b)) * 8
    # Simplifies to:
    # 4 * log(3x) == 8 * log(2x)
    # Or:
    # log((3x)^4) == log((2x)^8)
    # exponentials:
    # (3x)^4 == (2x)^8
    # Expand:
    left = (3 * x) ** 4
    right = (2 * x) ** 8
    return abs(left - right) < 1e-12

# Enumerate and print candidates where equality approximately holds
for x in candidates:
    if check_equation(x):
        print(f"Candidate solution for x: {x}")
```
