The problem asks to find a unique natural number \( k \) between 2 and 40 such that the expression \(\frac{k(k - 1)}{40 \times 39}\) equals \(\frac{5}{12}\). We need to enumerate possible \( k \) values in that range and check this equality to find the specific \( k \).

Here is a Python script that will compute for each \( k \) in [2, 40], check if the expression equals \( 5/12 \), and immediately print each match. Since the problem specifies there should be a unique solution, this script will identify and output that solution.

```python
# Enumerate k from 2 to 40
for k in range(2, 41):
    # Calculate the expression
    value = (k * (k - 1)) / (40 * 39)
    # Check if it equals 5/12
    if abs(value - 5/12) < 1e-12:
        print(f"Answer: k = {k}")
```

This script will output the value of \( k \) that satisfies the given equation, assisting in the conjecture and validation process.
