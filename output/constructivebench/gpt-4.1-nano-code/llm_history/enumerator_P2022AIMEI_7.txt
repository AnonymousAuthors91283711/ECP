The problem appears to involve analyzing a certain ratio of products of nine distinct integers from 1 to 9, with specific coprimality and injection/range constraints, and identifying the minimal (m, n) satisfying the ratio equation. To assist in conjecturing or proving the answer, I'll generate all possible 9-element injective functions f mapping {0,...,8} to {1,...,9}, compute the ratio, and track the minimal positive ratio in simplest form, since the problem asks for the least such pair (m, n).

Note:
- We enumerate all permutations of {1,...,9}.
- For each permutation, assign f(i) accordingly, then compute the ratio.
- Simplify the ratio to lowest terms using gcd.
- Keep track of the minimal ratio, output each candidate immediately.

This brute-force approach should be efficient enough given the small domain (9! = 362880 permutations), and the feedback allows streaming answers.

```python
import math
from itertools import permutations

# Variables to track the minimal ratio found
min_ratio_num = None
min_ratio_den = None

# Function to compare ratios without floating point
def is_less(n1, d1, n2, d2):
    return n1 * d2 < n2 * d1

# Generate all permutations f : {0,..,8} -> {1,..,9}
for perm in permutations(range(1, 10), 9):
    a, b, c, d, e, f_, g, h, i_ = perm

    numerator = a * b * c - d * e * f_
    denominator = g * h * i_

    if denominator == 0:
        continue

    # Ensure ratio is positive
    if numerator <= 0:
        continue

    gcd_val = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)
    num = numerator // gcd_val
    den = denominator // gcd_val

    # Check if this is the smallest ratio so far
    if min_ratio_num is None or is_less(num, den, min_ratio_num, min_ratio_den):
        min_ratio_num, min_ratio_den = num, den
        # Output the current minimal ratio immediately
        print(f"Found a new minimal ratio: {num}/{den} from permutation {perm}")

# After iteration, output the minimal ratio
print(f"Minimum ratio found: {min_ratio_num}/{min_ratio_den}")
```
