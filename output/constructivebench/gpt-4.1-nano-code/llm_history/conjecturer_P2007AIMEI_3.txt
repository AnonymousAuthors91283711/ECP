abbrev P2007AIMEI_3_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2007AIMEI_3 (b : ℝ) (hb : 0 < b) :
    let z := 9 + b * I
    (z^2).im = (z^3).im ↔ b = P2007AIMEI_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 15.0000000000000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the pattern in the enumerated answer (15) and analyzing the problem structure, the answer involves the value of \(b\) that equates the imaginary parts of \(z^2\) and \(z^3\).

The conjectured simplified closed-form answer is \(b = 15\). 

Therefore, the answer expression is <<<15>>>.
