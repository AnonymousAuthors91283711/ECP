The problem appears to involve natural numbers, primes, and factorials, and asks us to analyze the set of all n > 0 such that a certain property holds: there does not exist a k with a range of composite numbers from k+1 to k+n, and k + n is less than n! (factorial of n). Our goal is to enumerate possible values of n that satisfy this property.

Given the complexity, we will:
- Fix small values of n (say up to 10).
- For each n, check if there exists a k such that all m in [k+1, k+n] are composite, and verify whether k+n < n!.
- Collect all such n and print answers as we find them.

This approach will help in conjecturing the pattern, which may lead to a proof.

```python
import math

# We target small n (1 to 10) for enumeration.
# For each n, check whether the property holds.

def is_prime(m):
    if m < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.isqrt(m)) + 1):
        if m % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

omnimath1018_answer = set()

for n in range(1, 11):
    factorial_n = math.factorial(n)
    found = False
    # Search for k such that k + n < n! and all numbers in [k+1, k+n] are composite
    # Since minimal k=0, iterate k up to n! - n
    max_k = factorial_n - n
    for k in range(max_k + 1):
        interval = range(k + 1, k + n + 1)
        # Check if all in interval are composite
        if all(not is_prime(m) for m in interval):
            # Check if k + n < n!
            if k + n < factorial_n:
                # Found an n satisfying the property
                print(f"Found n={n} with k={k} forming a composite block of length {n}")
                omnimath1018_answer.add(n)
                found = True
                break
    if not found:
        # If no such k, then n not in the set
        pass

print("Answer set:", sorted(omnimath1018_answer))
```
