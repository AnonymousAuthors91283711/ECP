This problem involves complex numbers and real parts, and asks to find the cardinality of the set of pairs (a, b) in ℝ² satisfying a complex equation:

\[
(\text{Re}(z) + i \text{Im}(z))^{2002} = \text{Re}(z) - i \text{Im}(z),
\]

where \( z = a + i b \).

First, rewrite the equation in terms of \( a \) and \( b \):
\[
(a + i b)^{2002} = a - i b,
\]
which is equivalent to:
\[
(a + i b)^{2002} = \overline{a + i b} = a - i b,
\]
where the right side is the complex conjugate of \( a + i b \).

This is quite elegant: the equation states that the 2002-th power of the complex number equals its conjugate.

---

### Mathematical observations:

- The conjugation property:
\[
(a + i b)^{2002} = \overline{a + i b}
\]
implies:
\[
z^{2002} = \overline{z},
\]
where \( z = a + i b \).

- Since \( \overline{z} = |z|^2 / z \), for \(z \neq 0\):
\[
z^{2002} = \frac{|z|^2}{z}.
\]

- Rearranged:
\[
z^{2003} = |z|^2,
\]

but since \(z^{2002} = \overline{z}\), both sides are equal. Let's approach it differently.

### Key step:

- For any \( z \neq 0 \):
\[
z^{2002} = \overline{z}.
\]
- Take modulus:
\[
|z|^{2002} = |\overline{z}| = |z|.
\]

- So, either:
  - \( |z| = 0 \Rightarrow z = 0 \), or
  - \( |z|^{2002} = |z| \Rightarrow |z|^{2002} - |z| = 0 \Rightarrow |z|( |z|^{2001} - 1 )=0 \).

- Therefore:
  - \( |z|=0 \Rightarrow z=0 \),
  - or \( |z|^{2001} = 1 \Rightarrow |z|=1 \), since \( |z| \ge 0 \).

Thus, possible solutions:

1. \( z=0 \),
2. \( |z|=1 \).

---

### For \( |z|=1 \):

- Given that \( z^{2002} = \overline{z} \), and \( |z|=1 \), so \( z = e^{i\theta} \).

- Compute \( z^{2002} = e^{i \theta \cdot 2002} \),
- And \( \overline{z} = e^{-i \theta} \).

- Equation:
\[
e^{i \theta \cdot 2002} = e^{-i \theta}.
\]

- Equate exponents modulo \( 2\pi \):

\[
2002 \theta \equiv - \theta \pmod{2\pi},
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
2003 \theta \equiv 0 \pmod{2\pi}.
\]

- So:

\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi k}{2003}, \quad k=0,1,2,\ldots,2002,
\]

since \( k=0,\ldots,2002 \) gives all solutions in \([0, 2\pi)\).

---

### For \( z=0 \):

- \( a=b=0 \).

---

### Total solutions:

- One solution at \( z=0 \),
- Plus solutions on the unit circle, corresponding to 2003 roots:
  \[
  z_k = e^{2\pi i k/2003},
  \]
  for \( k=0,\ldots,2002 \).

- Corresponding \((a, b) = (\cos \theta, \sin \theta)\) for these roots.

---

### Set size:

- Total solutions: \( 1 + 2003 \).

---

### Final answer:

The set cardinality is \( 2004 \).

---

### Implementation plan:

- The enumerator will compute these solutions explicitly, including the solutions at \(z=0\) and points on the unit circle, with their \(\theta\) values.

Here's the Python program:

```python
import math

# Enumerate solutions: z=0
solutions = [(0.0, 0.0)]
print(f"Solution 1: a=0.0, b=0.0")  # z=0

# Enumerate solutions on the unit circle
P = 2003
for k in range(P):
    theta = 2 * math.pi * k / P
    a = math.cos(theta)
    b = math.sin(theta)
    print(f"Solution {k+2}: a={a:.6f}, b={b:.6f}")
```

This code outputs all \( 2004 \) solutions: one at the origin and 2003 evenly spaced points on the unit circle, matching the theoretical count.
