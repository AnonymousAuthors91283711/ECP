The problem asks for the greatest natural number n such that 0 < n and there exists a k > 0 with k * (n + 1) = 840!. We need to find all possible n, given that n + 1 divides 840!.

Since 840! is divisible by many numbers, the key is to consider all divisors d of 840!, and set n + 1 = d, where d divides 840!. Then n = d - 1. The problem asks for the greatest such n, so the maximum divisor d of 840! will give the maximum n, which is the largest divisor of 840!, i.e., 840! itself.

In summary:
- All n satisfying the condition are of the form n = d - 1, where d divides 840! and d > 0.
- The greatest such n corresponds to d = 840!, because 840! is divisible by itself, so n = 840! - 1.

Thus, the answer is n = 840! - 1. Since the task explicitly says to enumerate and check, we can verify the divisors of 840! and confirm the maximum.

Given that directly enumerating all divisors of 840! is enormous, in practice, we recognize 840! divides itself, and this gives the maximum divisor.

Here is the code to support this reasoning:

```python
# The goal is to find the maximum n such that (n+1) divides 840!
# Since 840! divides itself, the maximum n is 840! - 1.

import math

def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Compute 840!
n_factorial = factorial(840)

# The greatest such n is then n_factorial - 1.
print("Maximum n:", n_factorial - 1)

# For completeness, check that n_factorial - 1 is valid:
# n + 1 = n_factorial divides 840!, as n + 1 = 840! divides 840! trivially.
# So, the answer is n = 840! - 1.
```

This program computes 840! and outputs the maximum n.
