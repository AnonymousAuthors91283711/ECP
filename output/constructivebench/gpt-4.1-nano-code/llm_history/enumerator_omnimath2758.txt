This problem involves parametric quadratic roots and the area calculation of a triangle formed by certain points motivated by the roots P and Q. Our goal is to determine the parameter `k` given that the area equals 80. 

Given the structure, we will explore small positive `k` values, compute P, Q, and the corresponding area, and look for when the area reaches 80. Since exact symbolic solving isn't feasible here, we numerically approximate for small values of `k`.

We will iterate over `k` from 0.1 to 10 in small steps, compute the relevant quantities, and check if the area is close to 80. When the area is approximately 80, we report the `k`.

```python
import math

def area_for_k(k):
    # Compute discriminant
    discriminant = (-3*k)**2 - 4 * 1 * (-4 * k**2)
    if discriminant < 0:
        return None  # No real roots
    
    sqrt_discriminant = math.sqrt(discriminant)
    P = (-(-3*k) - sqrt_discriminant) / (2 * 1)
    Q = (-(-3*k) + sqrt_discriminant) / (2 * 1)
    
    # Points: (0,0), (P, P^2), (Q, Q^2)
    # Area calculation using shoelace
    area = 0.5 * abs(
        0 * (P**2 - Q**2) +
        P * (Q**2 - 0) +
        Q * (0 - P**2)
    )
    return area

# Search for k in a range
for k in [i/10 for i in range(1, 101)]:  # k from 0.1 to 10 in steps of 0.1
    area_value = area_for_k(k)
    if area_value is not None:
        # Check if close to 80 within a tolerance
        if abs(area_value - 80) < 0.5:
            print(f"k ≈ {k:.2f} yields area ≈ {area_value:.2f}")
```
