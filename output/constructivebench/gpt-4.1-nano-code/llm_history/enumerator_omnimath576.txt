[write_program]
The provided code is in Lean (a proof assistant language), involving advanced concepts like topology, filters, and functions over finite types, combined with properties such as idempotence. Since the problem appears to ask for an enumerator to assist in conjecturing and proving an answer, and it references an infinite sum involving factorials and some function counts, a natural candidate for investigation is the sum:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{| \text{Idem}(n) |}{n!}
\]

where \(\text{Idem}(n)\) is the set of idempotent functions \(f : \text{Fin}(n) \to \text{Fin}(n)\). The key is to enumerate candidates for \(\left| \text{Idem}(n) \right|\), perhaps starting with small \(n\), and sum their ratios to approximate or deduce the sum.

Since explicit counts are involved and the problem seems theoretical, a practical approach is to approximate the count \(\left| \text{Idem}(n) \right|\) for small \(n\), then sum terms up to some small \(n\).

```python
# Enumerate the number of idempotent functions on Fin(n), for small n
# For each n, compute the number of such functions, then sum ratios over n! to explore the infinite sum

def count_idempotent_functions(n):
    # Count of idempotent functions on a set of size n
    # For small n, we enumerate: the number of functions f: Fin(n)->Fin(n) with f(f(x))=f(x)
    # Since counting all functions explicitly is complex, for small n we can verify a pattern
    # Known count for idempotent functions is the number of functions with identity on their images
    # Each idempotent function corresponds to a subset of the set (the image), and a choice of an onto function from the set to its image
    # The count is sum_{k=0}^{n} C(n,k) * k^{n}
    from math import comb
    total = 0
    for k in range(n+1):
        total += comb(n, k) * (k ** n)
    return total

# Set small maximum n for enumeration
max_n = 10

print("Enumerating sum of ratios for n=0 to", max_n)
total_sum = 0.0

for n in range(max_n+1):
    count_idem = count_idempotent_functions(n)
    ratio = count_idem / (factorial(n))
    print(f"n={n}: idempotent functions={count_idem}, ratio={ratio}")
    total_sum += ratio

print(f"Partial sum up to n={max_n}: {total_sum}")
```
