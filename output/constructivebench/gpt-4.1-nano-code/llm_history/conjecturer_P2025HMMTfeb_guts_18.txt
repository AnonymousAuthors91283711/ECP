noncomputable abbrev P2025HMMTfeb_guts_18_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2025HMMTfeb_guts_18 :
  Fintype.card {S : Finset (Icc 1 2025) | S.Nonempty ∧ 
    ∀ a ∈ S, ∀ b ∈ S, ∃ c ∈ S, 2025 ∣ (a.val + b.val - 2 * c.val)} = P2025HMMTfeb_guts_18_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 2025. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the total count relates to the number of elements, likely influenced by the divisibility condition. The key insight is that the elements in S must satisfy a linear relation modulo 2025, and enumeration hints at the total closely matching 2025. Hence, the elegant closed-form is simply 2025, matching the upper bound and the given enumeration.
