This problem seems to involve combinatorial arrangements of functions from Fin 8 to integers, with specific conditions on the preimages of certain values, and a relation involving differences of indices. To explore possible solutions, we need to generate functions s: Fin 8 → ℤ satisfying:

- For each k in [1,4], the set of indices i where s i = k has size exactly 2.
- For all i, j: if s i = s j, then, given i < j, the difference j - i = s i.

Given the constraints, the key observations are:
- The values of s are integers, with each value in [1,4].
- Each value in [1,4] appears exactly twice.
- The second condition suggests that the indices i and j with the same s i = s j form pairs where j - i = s i.

Hence, the structure resembles pairing indices with the value as the difference between the indices.

Approach:
- Generate all possible pairings of the 8 indices into 4 pairs.
- Assign to each pair a value k in [1,4].
- Compute s: for each index, s i = the value assigned to its pair.
- Check that for each pair (i, j): j - i = s i.
- Output all such functions.

This enumeration is feasible because:
- Number of pairings of 8 elements into 4 pairs: (8-1)!! = 1050.
- For each pairing, assign values to pairs: 4^4 = 256 options.
- Check constraints.

Let's implement this:

```python
import itertools

# Generate all pairings of 8 indices into 4 pairs
indices = list(range(8))
pairings = []

# Generate all combinations for the first pair
for first in itertools.combinations(indices, 2):
    remaining1 = [i for i in indices if i not in first]
    for second in itertools.combinations(remaining1, 2):
        remaining2 = [i for i in remaining1 if i not in second]
        for third in itertools.combinations(remaining2, 2):
            remaining3 = [i for i in remaining2 if i not in third]
            fourth = remaining3
            # Each pairing is a tuple of pairs
            pairing = [tuple(sorted(p)) for p in [first, second, third, fourth]]
            # To avoid duplicates, sort pairs
            pairing.sort()
            pairings.append(pairing)

# For each pairing, assign values in [1..4], check the difference condition
for pairing in pairings:
    for values in itertools.product(range(1, 5), repeat=4):
        s = [0]*8
        valid = True
        for idx, (i, j) in enumerate(pairing):
            val = values[idx]
            # Check difference condition
            if abs(j - i) != val:
                valid = False
                break
            s[i] = val
            s[j] = val
        if valid:
            # Output the function s as a tuple
            print(tuple(s))
```

This code systematically enumerates potential solutions, printing each valid s immediately, which helps in conjecturing the correct structure.
