. Enumerated answers: (2, 2)
(12, 17)
(17, 12). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
The pattern suggests that pairs are symmetric with respect to swapping when both are positive and satisfy the divisibility conditions. After analysis, the common solutions seem to be the small integral pairs where both satisfy the relation constraints. Based on enumerated pairs, the solution set includes only these specific pairs.
