. Expected Answer Type: ℝ × ℝ
Based on the roots of Q and the pattern of P's evaluations, the point with distinct roots and relations appears to be where the roots are roughly -5.26, 3.14, 2.12, and P maps them cyclically. The approximate roots suggest taking r ≈ 3.14, s ≈ 2.12, t ≈ -5.26, matching the cycle.
