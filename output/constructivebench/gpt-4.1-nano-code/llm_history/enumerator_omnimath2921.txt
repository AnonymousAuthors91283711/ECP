This problem seems to involve finding the smallest positive integer divisible by 3, 5, 7, and 9. The task is to verify that this integer is the least such number and to provide it as `omnimath2921_answer`. To do this, I will compute the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers, as that represents the smallest positive number divisible by all of them.

Here's the plan:
- Use Python's built-in `math.gcd` to compute gcds.
- Compute the LCM of 3, 5, 7, and 9 directly.
- Print the answer immediately upon computing.

This approach is efficient and straightforward.

```python
import math

# Parameters
numbers = [3, 5, 7, 9]
# Compute the LCM of the list
lcm = 1
for num in numbers:
    lcm = lcm * num // math.gcd(lcm, num)
    print(lcm)  # Stream partial results

# Final answer â€“ the least common multiple
omnimath2921_answer = lcm
print("Least common multiple:", omnimath2921_answer)
```

This code calculates the minimal number satisfying the divisibility conditions and outputs intermediate results for clarity.
