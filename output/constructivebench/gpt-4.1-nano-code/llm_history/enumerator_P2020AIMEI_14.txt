This problem involves finding a specific symmetric sum based on the roots of a quadratic polynomial composition, with roots involving two variables \(a, b\). It appears to be related to characteristics of quadratic polynomials and their roots.

Since the key part is identifying roots of a composed polynomial and then calculating \((a + b)^2\), I will explore small candidate roots \(a, b\) and verify the corresponding sums. The polynomial \(P\) is quadratic with leading coefficient 1, so \(P(x) = x^2 + px + q\) for some real \(p, q\).

Given roots \(\{3, 4, a, b\}\), a natural approach is to consider these roots as potential candidates, and check possible polynomials with roots among these values, then derive \(a + b\).

I will enumerate pairs \((a, b)\) from a small set: \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\), check if these satisfy the root conditions, and record \((a + b)^2\).

```python
# Enumerate small pairs (a, b) from set of candidate roots
candidate_roots = [1, 2, 3, 4]
results = set()

# Generate all pairs with a <= b to avoid duplicates
for i in range(len(candidate_roots)):
    for j in range(i, len(candidate_roots)):
        a = candidate_roots[i]
        b = candidate_roots[j]
        sum_ab = a + b
        square_sum = sum_ab ** 2
        print(f"pair: a={a}, b={b}, (a+b)^2={square_sum}")
        results.add(square_sum)

# Output all distinct results
print("Possible (a + b)^2 values:", sorted(results))
```
