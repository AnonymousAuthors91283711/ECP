Ground Truth Answer: 163/256
Proposed Answer: (↑(56 + 28 + 8 + 1) * (1/2)^8)
Let me analyze this step by step.

1. The problem is calculating a sum of binomial coefficients for k ≥ 4, up to k=8, each multiplied by (1/2)^8.

2. The binomial coefficients C(8,k) for k=4 to 8 are:
   C(8,4) = 70
   C(8,5) = 56
   C(8,6) = 28
   C(8,7) = 8
   C(8,8) = 1

3. The ground truth answer sums these coefficients and divides by 256 (which is 2^8):
   (70 + 56 + 28 + 8 + 1)/256 = 163/256

4. The proposed answer sums only (56 + 28 + 8 + 1) and divides by 256, missing the C(8,4)=70 term.

The proposed answer is incorrect because it omits the k=4 case (which is 70). The correct sum should include all terms from k=4 to k=8.
