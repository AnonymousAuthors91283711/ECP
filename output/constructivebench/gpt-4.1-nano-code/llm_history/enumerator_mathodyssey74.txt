The problem involves finding the cardinality of the set of real triplets (x, y, z) satisfying specific algebraic equations. To aid in conjecture and eventual proof, I will programmatically search for solutions with small integer values, as these often reveal structural patterns or potential solutions. We focus on small integers within a bounded range to keep computations efficient and manageable.

I'll check values of x, y, z in the small range from -10 to 10, evaluate the equations, and identify solutions that satisfy both equations exactly or to high precision. If solutions are found, I'll count their total number, which will serve as the answer.

```python
# Enumerate small integer solutions (x, y, z) within range -10 to 10
# to estimate the number of solutions satisfying the equations.
import math

solutions = []

# Define the equations for checking
def eq1(x, y, z):
    return math.isclose(x**2 * y + y**2 * z + z**2, 0, rel_tol=1e-9, abs_tol=1e-9)

def eq2(x, y, z):
    lhs = z**3 + z**2 * y + z * y**3 + x**2 * y
    rhs = 0.25 * (x**4 + y**4)
    return math.isclose(lhs, rhs, rel_tol=1e-9, abs_tol=1e-9)

# Search in range -10 to 10 for x, y, z
for x in range(-10, 11):
    for y in range(-10, 11):
        for z in range(-10, 11):
            if eq1(x, y, z) and eq2(x, y, z):
                solutions.append((x, y, z))
                print(f"Solution found: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")

# Count and output the total number of solutions found
print(f"Total solutions in small range: {len(solutions)}")
```
