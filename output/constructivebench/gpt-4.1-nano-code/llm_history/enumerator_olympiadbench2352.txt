The problem involves solving the equation \(x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{13}{6}\) for \(x\), then computing \(x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2}\). We know that:

\[
x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = \left(x + \frac{1}{x}\right)^2 - 2
\]

which simplifies our task to finding \(\left(\frac{13}{6}\right)^2 - 2\). Since we're to explore solutions systematically, we'll find the possible \(x\) values (using the quadratic equation derived from the given sum), then compute \(x^2 + 1/x^2\) for each, printing all candidate answers.

```python
import math

# Equation: x + 1/x = 13/6
# Multiply both sides by x: x^2 + 1 = (13/6) x
# Rearranged: x^2 - (13/6) x + 1 = 0

# Coefficients for quadratic: ax^2 + bx + c = 0
a = 1
b = -(13/6)
c = 1

# Discriminant
D = b**2 - 4 * a * c

# List to store solutions
answers = []

if D >= 0:
    sqrt_D = math.sqrt(D)
    # First solution
    x1 = (-b + sqrt_D) / (2 * a)
    x2 = (-b - sqrt_D) / (2 * a)
    
    # For each solution, compute x^2 + 1/x^2
    for x in [x1, x2]:
        val = x**2 + 1/(x**2)
        print(val)
        answers.append(val)
```
