Let's analyze the functional equation:
\[ f(2x + 3) = 2f(x) + 3 \]
with the initial condition:
\[ f(0) = 6 \]

Our goal is to find \(f(9)\).

---

# Approach:
- Use the known recursive relationship to express \(f\) at various points.
- Determine the form of \(f\), which appears affine (linear).
- Solve for the general form of \(f\).
- Then evaluate at \(x=9\).

Given the recursive functional equation, hypothesize:
\[ f(x) = ax + b \]
for some constants \(a, b\).

Plug into the equation:
\[ f(2x+3) = 2f(x)+3 \]

Since \(f(t) = at + b\),
\[ a(2x+3) + b = 2(ax + b) + 3 \]
\[ 2ax + 3a + b = 2ax + 2b + 3 \]

Compare coefficients:
- Coefficients of \(x\): automatically balanced.
- Constants:
\[ 3a + b = 2b + 3 \]
\[ 3a = b + 3 \]
\[ b = 3a - 3 \]

Now, using initial condition \(f(0) = 6\):
\[ f(0) = a \cdot 0 + b = 6 \]
\[ b = 6 \]

From previous:
\[ b = 3a - 3 \]
\[ 6 = 3a - 3 \]
\[ 3a = 9 \]
\[ a = 3 \]

Thus,
\[ b = 6 \]
and
\[ f(x) = 3x + 6 \]

Finally, evaluate:
\[ f(9) = 3 \times 9 + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

---

# Implementation:
I'll write a Python program that verifies the affine form and computes \(f(9)\).

```python
# Given functional equation and initial condition
# f(2x + 3) = 2f(x) + 3
# f(0) = 6

# Assume f(x) = a*x + b
# From analysis:
a = 3
b = 6

# Function f(x)
def f(x):
    return a * x + b

# Compute f(9)
answer = f(9)
print("Answer:", answer)
```
