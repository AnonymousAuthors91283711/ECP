The problem appears to define a function from a finite set of three elements to real numbers, with the conditions:
1. The values are strictly increasing.
2. Certain specified real numbers (√2011, 2011, 2011^2) each correspond to exactly one of these three values.

To assist in conjecturing and proving the answer, let's enumerate all possible increasing triples from among these three special numbers, since these are the only candidates satisfying the uniqueness condition.

We will generate all permutations of the three numbers that are strictly increasing:
- (√2011, 2011, 2011^2)
- (√2011, 2011^2, 2011)
- (2011, √2011, 2011^2)
- (2011, 2011^2, √2011)
- (2011^2, √2011, 2011)
- (2011^2, 2011, √2011)

Only the increasing orderings are valid, which simplifies to just one:  
(√2011, 2011, 2011^2).

Let's implement a Python script that explicitly enumerates such increasing triples from these candidates to help visualize possible solutions.

```python
# Enumerate all increasing triples from specified special numbers for conjecture
import math

# Define the special numbers
sqrt_2011 = math.sqrt(2011)
num_2011 = 2011
square_2011 = 2011 ** 2

# List of candidates
candidates = [sqrt_2011, num_2011, square_2011]

# Generate only the strictly increasing triples (all permutations where order is increasing)
from itertools import permutations

for triple in permutations(candidates, 3):
    if list(triple) == sorted(triple):
        print(f"omnimath3452_answer: {list(triple)}")
```

This code systematically enumerates all strictly increasing triples from the three special numbers, helping to verify the possible candidates respecting the theorem's conditions.
