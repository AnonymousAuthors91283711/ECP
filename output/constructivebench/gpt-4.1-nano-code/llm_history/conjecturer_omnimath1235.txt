. Enumerated answers: tan(pi/7*1): 0.4815746188075286
tan(pi/7*2): 1.2539603376627038
tan(pi/7*3): 4.381286267534822
Product: 2.64575131106459
The product appears different from 1, suggest further algebraic analysis.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The product of these tangents relates to roots of unity and their tangent values, which are known to have algebraic identities involving square roots. Calculating the approximate product (≈ 2.64575) and recognizing the pattern, it corresponds to √7. Hence, the closed form is √7.

<<<Real.sqrt 7>>>
