The problem involves solving the algebraic equation \(4(x + 4) = 24 + 3(2x - 2)\) for \(x\). We want to systematically find all solutions to aid in conjecturing the answer. Since it's a straightforward linear equation, we'll generate candidate solutions across a small range around the expected solution, focusing first on exact rational candidates, then approximate if needed.

We'll:
- Choose sample integer values for \(x\) and check the equation.
- Print solutions whenever the left and right sides are equal.
- Specifically verify candidates near the anticipated solution.
- Avoid hardcoding the answer; instead, systematically generate solutions.

Here's the program that explores \(x\) within a small integer domain:

```python
# Enumerate potential solutions for the given linear equation
# Equation: 4*(x + 4) = 24 + 3*(2x - 2)

for x in range(-10, 11):  # Small sample range around expected solution
    left = 4 * (x + 4)
    right = 24 + 3 * (2 * x - 2)
    if left == right:
        print(f"x = {x} is a solution, since {left} = {right}")
```

This code prints each found solution immediately, providing candidates to help establish the true answer.
