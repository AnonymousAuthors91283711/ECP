Number of solutions: 20. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The solutions involve evaluating a polynomial at two points, with the difference giving a constant multiple of (b - 2)^k. The differences and the grouped pattern suggest the possible roots are centered around small integers with a symmetric distribution, especially near b = 2. The enumeration likely points to this distribution. Among the options, the 20 solutions seem grouped around particular symmetric or small integer values, with multiple roots outside the range [-12, 16], but indecisive from enumeration alone. Considering polynomial degree and range, the count matches a pattern around fundamental roots at these points. The most fitting minimal set of solutions matching the enumeration and count is centered around the roots within the bounds, with the symmetry/pattern indicating roots at all integer points from -24 to 24 inclusive, particularly due to the density of solutions within that range and the total count being 20. The total number of roots then is calculated from the pattern: the set includes 20 solutions, which corresponds to 20 roots; From enumeration, roots near 24, 28, 79, 93 don't fit their count, but the middle set [-20, 16] count totals matches.

Answer: the count aligns with roots between -24 and 24, taking all integers in that range.

Number of solutions: 20. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The enumeration suggests roots at the 20 distinct integer points listed, spanning from -89 to 93, with particular attention to the small and symmetric roots like -24, -20, -12, etc. The polynomial evaluations at 2 and at root b imply roots at these points where the polynomial takes specific values.

Since the total count aligns with the 20 specified roots, and the roots are symmetric around zero (e.g., -24, -20, -12, -11, -9, -5, 0, 1, 3, 4, 9, 13, 15, 16, 24, 28, 79, 93, with a missing one), the set includes all these roots.

The question asks for a closed-form set of roots matching the count; based on the enumeration, the most concise and inclusive description is the set of all integers listed explicitly, which can be succinctly represented by the set containing all these roots.

Given the structure, the roots are explicitly:

- Negative roots: -89, -75, -24, -20, -12, -11, -9, -5
- Zero and positive roots: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9, 13, 15, 16, 24, 28, 79, 93

Thus, the closed form in Lean that captures these roots is the set of these specific integers.

Number of solutions: 20. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the enumeration, the total number of roots is 20, and the roots are explicitly listed as the finite set of integers: {-89, -75, -24, -20, -12, -11, -9, -5, 0, 1, 3, 4, 9, 13, 15, 16, 24, 28, 79, 93}. The problem asks for a closed form of the count of such roots, which suggests directly returning the size of this finite set, i.e., 20.

Since the roots are explicitly enumerated, the answer is the natural number representing their total count, which is 20. This matches the enumerated number of solutions.

Thus, the corrected answer in Lean is simply the constant 20.
