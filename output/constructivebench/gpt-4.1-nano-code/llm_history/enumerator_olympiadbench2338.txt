[write_program]
This problem involves solving the rational equation (x^2 + x + 4) / (2x + 1) = 4 / x over real numbers. To assist in conjecturing and verifying the solution set, I will write a Python program that enumerates possible solutions by checking rational candidates within a small range and approximate solutions when necessary. The program will:

- Check rational candidates with small integers.
- Solve the algebraic equation symbolically where feasible.
- Stream solutions as they are found.
- Prioritize exact rational solutions before considering floating-point approximations.

Because no specific constraints are given, I'll sample x in a small range, such as integers from -10 to 10, avoiding division by zero, and check if they satisfy the equation.

```python
# Enumerate solutions to (x^2 + x + 4) / (2x + 1) = 4 / x over rationals in a small integer range.
from fractions import Fraction

# Define the range of candidate x values
candidates = list(range(-10, 11))
solutions = []

for x_int in candidates:
    if x_int == 0 or (2 * x_int + 1) == 0:
        # skip division by zero
        continue
    x = Fraction(x_int)
    # Compute left and right sides as fractions
    left = (x*x + x + 4) / (2*x + 1)
    right = Fraction(4, x)
    if left == right:
        print(f"Solution found: x = {x} (exact rational)")
        solutions.append(x)

# Output approximate solutions for larger floating ranges
for x_float in [Fraction(n, 1) for n in range(-100, 101)]:
    if x_float == 0 or (2 * x_float + 1) == 0:
        continue
    approx_x = float(x_float)
    left = (approx_x**2 + approx_x + 4) / (2*approx_x + 1)
    right = 4 / approx_x
    if abs(left - right) < 1e-6:
        print(f"Approximate solution: x â‰ˆ {approx_x}")

# List all rational solutions found
# Note: For a complete set, one might solve algebraically, but here we empirically find solutions.
```
