Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 4, 6, 16)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b, c, d) | a = 1 ∧ b = 4 ∧ c = 6 ∧ d = 16}
<<<True>>>

The proposed answer is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both specify the same single solution (1, 4, 6, 16) for the tuple (a, b, c, d). The proposed answer uses set builder notation while the ground truth uses explicit enumeration, but they represent identical sets. The conditions a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d and the set equation {a*b + c*d, a*c + b*d, a*d + b*c} = {40, 70, 100} are satisfied by this unique solution.
