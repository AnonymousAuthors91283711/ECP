The problem involves finding real numbers \( r, s, t \) satisfying certain polynomial relationships, with parameters involved, and conditions on these roots and evaluations. To help conjecture the answer, I will generate possible triplets \( (r, s, t) \), focusing on roots of the cubic polynomial \( Q = X^3 - 21X + 35 \), then check if they satisfy the conditions involving the quadratic polynomial \( P \). Since exact roots of \( Q \) are complicated to compute algebraically, I'll approximate numerical roots, test permutations, and evaluate \( P \) at these roots to see if the given relations hold.

```python
import numpy as np
from itertools import permutations

# Polynomial Q: X^3 - 21X + 35
# Polynomial P: X^2 + (r)*X + s, with r and s to find
# Conditions involve roots of Q and their images under P

# Approximate roots of Q using numpy
roots_Q = np.roots([1, 0, -21, 35])  # Coefficients for X^3 - 21X + 35

# Filter real roots for clarity
real_roots = [r for r in roots_Q if np.isclose(r.imag, 0, atol=1e-8)]
print("Approximate real roots of Q:", real_roots)

# We will check permutations of these roots for possible (r, s, t)
for triplet in permutations(real_roots, 3):
    r, s, t = triplet
    # We interpret conditions:
    # Q.eval(r) ≈ 0, Q.eval(s) ≈ 0, Q.eval(t) ≈ 0 (roots)
    # P(X) = X^2 + r*X + s
    # Check if P(r)=s, P(s)=t, P(t)=r
    P_r = r**2 + r * r + s
    P_s = s**2 + r * s + s
    P_t = t**2 + r * t + s

    # Check if P(r) ≈ s, P(s) ≈ t, P(t) ≈ r
    if (np.isclose(P_r, s, atol=1e-4) and
        np.isclose(P_s, t, atol=1e-4) and
        np.isclose(P_t, r, atol=1e-4)):
        print(f"Candidate triplet: r={r:.3f}, s={s:.3f}, t={t:.3f}")
```
