The problem describes a 5x5 matrix M with each row and column containing all 5 characters 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E' respectively, and specific values given for the first two rows. It asks to determine the value of M at position (2,2), i.e., row 2, column 2, possibly based on these constraints.

Since each row and column is a permutation of the characters, and the first two rows are fixed, the remaining entries in row 2 (index 2) follow from the permutations. Let's analyze and enumerate all possible values for M(2,2).

**Approach:**
- The first row (row 0) has 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'.
- The second row (row 1) has 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'A'.
- Each row is a permutation; similarly, columns must be permutations, which constrains the permutations.

We will generate all permutations of the characters for row 2, considering the constraints, then check which permutations satisfy the column constraints (each column also must be a permutation).

Since permutations are small (only 5 elements), it's feasible to generate all possibilities.

Let's code this enumeration.

```python
import itertools

characters = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']

# Fixed first and second rows
row0 = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
row1 = ['B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'A']

# Generate all permutations for row 2
for perm in itertools.permutations(characters):
    row2 = list(perm)
    # Check if columns are permutations
    column_ok = True
    for col_idx in range(5):
        col = {row0[col_idx], row1[col_idx], row2[col_idx]}
        if len(col) != 3:
            column_ok = False
            break
        # Each column should contain 3 unique characters (since only 3 rows)
        # and all characters in the column are from characters
        # No missing or repeated constraints here yet, but need to check column permutations
        # Actually, for column to be a permutation of length 3, it must also contain 3 distinct characters
        col_vals = {row0[col_idx], row1[col_idx], row2[col_idx]}
        if len(col_vals) != 3:
            column_ok = False
            break
    if not column_ok:
        continue
    # Now, check if columns are permutations of all 5 characters? No, only three entries per column
    # Since each column has only 3 entries, the only permutation constraint is that the three entries are distinct
    # which we've checked. But the question involves permutations for entire matrix columns.
    # Given the constraints, the only restriction for the remaining row is that in columns, entries are distinct.
    # To fully satisfy the permutation constraints, columns must contain all 5 characters, but with only 3 entries,
    # it's impossible. Therefore, the problem likely wants permutations per row and columns in the context of the 5x5 matrix
    # with entire columns being permutations of all 5 characters.
    # Since the first two rows are fixed, the only unknown is row 2, and the question is about M(2,2), i.e., row 2, column 2.
    answer = row2[2]
    print(answer)
```

This enumeration lists all possible values at position (2,2) consistent with the constraints of the problem, focusing on permutations and the given data. It should provide the set of candidate characters for M(2,2).
