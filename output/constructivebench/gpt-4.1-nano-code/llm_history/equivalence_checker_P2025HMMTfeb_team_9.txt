Ground Truth Answer: {p | Nat.Prime p ∧ (p = 5 ∨ p % 5 = 1 ∨ p % 5 = 4)}
Proposed Answer: {p : ℕ | Nat.Prime p ∧ p ≥ 3}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding all prime numbers p for which there exists a periodic function f: ℤ → ℤ (with period p) satisfying a certain functional condition.

2. The ground truth answer restricts primes to those that are either:
   - equal to 5, or
   - congruent to 1 mod 5, or
   - congruent to 4 mod 5

3. The proposed answer claims that all primes ≥ 3 satisfy the condition, which is much broader.

4. The ground truth answer is known to be correct from mathematical literature (this is related to fixed points of periodic functions and quadratic residues modulo p).

5. The proposed answer includes many primes that don't satisfy the condition (e.g., p=7, since 7 ≡ 2 mod 5, which isn't in {1,4}).

The proposed answer is incorrect as it includes too many primes that don't satisfy the given condition.
