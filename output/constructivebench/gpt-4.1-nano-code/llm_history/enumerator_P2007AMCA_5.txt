This problem involves solving an equation of the form:

0.2 * x + 0.1 * (1 - 0.2) * x = 10500

which simplifies to a linear equation in x. To assist in verifying solutions or exploring potential answers, I will enumerate candidate values for x in a reasonable range around a rough estimate, demonstrating how to find solutions numerically. Since the exact analytical solution is straightforward, the program will emphasize enumerating possible solutions within a specified range.

```python
# Enumerate candidate answers for x by stepping through a range
# this helps verify solutions and explore possible values

# Parameters from the equation:
# 0.2 * x + 0.1 * 0.8 * x = 10500
# Simplify to find approximate x
# (0.2 + 0.1 * 0.8) * x = 10500
# (0.2 + 0.08) * x = 10500
# 0.28 * x = 10500
# x ≈ 10500 / 0.28 ≈ 37500

# We'll scan values around this estimate

start = int(37500 * 0.9)  # 90% of estimate
end = int(37500 * 1.1)    # 110% of estimate
step = 100  # step size for enumeration

for candidate in range(start, end + 1, step):
    lhs = 0.2 * candidate + 0.1 * 0.8 * candidate
    print(candidate, lhs)
```
