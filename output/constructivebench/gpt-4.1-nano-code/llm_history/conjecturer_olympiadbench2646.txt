theorem olympiadbench2646 :
  IsLeast {s : ℕ | ∃ (a b : ℕ → ℕ) (da db : ℕ),
    (∀ i, a (i + 1) = a i + da) ∧
    (∀ i, b (i + 1) = b i + db) ∧
    (∀ i j, a i ≠ b j) ∧
    a 20 + b 14 = 1000 ∧
    b 20 + a 14 = s} olympiadbench2646_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 1000. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem asks for the minimal value s = b 20 + a 14 satisfying the conditions with sequences a, b, and constants da, db. Given the symmetry and the sum constraints, it simplifies to s ≥ 1000, and the minimal sum achievable is 1000. 

<<<1000>>>
