Ground Truth Answer: {1}
Proposed Answer: {r | r = 1.0}
<<<True>>>

Explanation: 
1. The ground truth answer is the set {1}, meaning the equation holds only when r=1.
2. The proposed answer is {r | r = 1.0}, which is exactly the same as {1} since 1.0 is just the real number 1 represented with a decimal point.
3. Both answers correctly identify that the only solution to the system of equations is r=1.
4. The notation difference (1 vs 1.0) is insignificant in this context as they represent the same real number.
