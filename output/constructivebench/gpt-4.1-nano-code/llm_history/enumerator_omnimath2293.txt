This problem involves counting the number of integers \( n \) between 1 and 999,999 such that there exists some \( k > 1 \) with \( k^3 \mid n \). 

In other words, we need to count numbers less than 1,000,000 that are divisible by cubes of integers greater than 1. The main challenge is efficiently enumerating the cube divisors and counting multiples.

Approach:
- Enumerate \( k \) starting from 2 upwards, where \( k^3 < 1,000,000 \).
- For each \( k \), count how many multiples of \( k^3 \) are less than 1,000,000.
- Use inclusion-exclusion for overlapping counts? Here, the divisors are powers of different \( k \), so the sets are overlapping if the numbers are divisible by the least common multiple of multiple \( k^3 \)s.

However, since the cube divisors are of the form \( k^3 \), and the set of multiples of \( k^3 \) up to \( N \) is \( \lfloor \frac{999999}{k^3} \rfloor \), summing over all \( k \) gives an initial count, but overlaps occur when numbers are divisible by multiple such cubes.

To simplify (since inclusion-exclusion can be complex):

- Use a set to avoid double counting.
- For each \( k \), add multiples of \( k^3 \) to this set.
- Count the size of the set at the end.

Because the maximum \( k \) satisfies \( k^3 < 1,000,000 \Rightarrow k < 100 \), as \( 100^3 = 1,000,000 \). So, for \( k \leq 99 \), enumerate.

Let's implement this efficiently:

```python
# Enumerate all k such that k^3 < 1,000,000
limit = 1_000_000
multiples_set = set()

for k in range(2, 100):  # k > 1
    cube = k ** 3
    for multiple in range(cube, limit, cube):
        multiples_set.add(multiple)

print(f"Answer: {len(multiples_set)}")
```

This code efficiently counts all n < 1,000,000 that are divisible by some \( k^3 \) with \( k > 1 \).

```python
# Enumerate and count integers less than 1,000,000 divisible by some cube greater than 1.
limit = 1_000_000
multiples_set = set()

for k in range(2, 100):  # k > 1 and k^3 < limit
    cube = k ** 3
    for multiple in range(cube, limit, cube):
        multiples_set.add(multiple)

print(f"Answer: {len(multiples_set)}")
```
