. Enumerated answers: (-0.25+0.5j). Expected Answer Type: ℂ
The pattern suggests the sum of a geometric series with ratio \( z = 1 - 2i \). The sum converges to \(\frac{1}{1 - z}\). Substituting \(z\), the sum becomes \(\frac{1}{1 - (1 - 2i)} = \frac{1}{2i} = -\frac{i}{2}\). Expressed as complex number \( -0.0 - 0.5i \), matching enumerated answer.

<<<(0 : ℂ) - (0 : ℂ) - (↑(1 / (2 : ℂ) * Complex.I))>>>
