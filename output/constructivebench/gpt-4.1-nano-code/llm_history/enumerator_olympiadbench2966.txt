This problem involves analyzing the divisors of the number 2000, specifically looking at values of \( K' > 9 \) such that \( (2010 - 10) \% (K'-9) = 0 \), i.e., \( 2000 \) is divisible by \( K'-9 \). Among those, we seek the minimal \( K' \) (larger than 9) for which the quotient \( d = \frac{2000}{K'-9} \) is as close as possible to the specific value 49, and no other divisor with the same condition yields a smaller difference.

Therefore:
- \( K' > 9 \)
- \( (K' - 9) \) divides 2000
- We compare \( |K' - 49| \) with \( |d - 49| \), where \( d = \frac{2000}{K'-9} \)

Let's implement this in Python: find all divisors of 2000, compute the corresponding \( K' \), then find the minimal difference.

```python
# Enumerate divisors of 2000 and find the K' > 9 that minimize |K' - 49|, considering the divisor is (K'-9)
import math

# The number to analyze
N = 2000

# Get all divisors of N
divisors = set()
for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(N)) + 1):
    if N % i == 0:
        divisors.add(i)
        divisors.add(N // i)

# Search for K' > 9 where (K'-9) divides N
candidates = []
for d in divisors:
    K_prime = d + 9
    if K_prime > 9:
        quotient = N // d
        diff_K = abs(K_prime - 49)
        diff_d = abs(quotient - 49)
        candidates.append((K_prime, d, quotient, diff_K, diff_d))

# Find the candidate(s) with minimal |K'-49|
# To break ties, pick the one with minimal |d - 49|
min_diff = min(c[3] for c in candidates)
# Filter candidates with minimal diff_K
min_candidates = [c for c in candidates if c[3] == min_diff]

# Among these, select the one with minimal |d - 49|
best_candidate = min(min_candidates, key=lambda c: c[4])

# Output the found answer
answer = best_candidate[0]

print("Best candidate K':", answer)
print("Corresponding divisor:", best_candidate[1])
print("Value of d = 2000 / divisor:", best_candidate[2])
print("Difference |K' - 49|:", best_candidate[3])
print("Difference |d - 49|:", best_candidate[4])
```

This code enumerates all divisor-derived candidates, measures their proximity to 49, and outputs the candidate most suitable for the problem's minimality criteria.
