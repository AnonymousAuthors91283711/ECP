This problem appears to involve a sequence p(n) with specific values at certain points and a recurrence relation for intermediate points, akin to a linear recurrence with boundary conditions. To explore possible values of p(0), we can try small integers or rational guesses consistent with the recurrence constraints.

The key points:
- p(0) = 1
- p(3) = 0
- p(6) = 0
- p(10) = 1
- p(11) = 0
- For n < 10 and n ≠ 3, 6, 10: p(n) = (p(n+1) + p(n+2))/2

Our goal: enumerate candidate sequences satisfying these relations, focusing on these points and the relation. We do not have boundary values at p(1), p(2), p(4), p(5), p(7), p(8), p(9), so let's try plausible rational values and check the recurrence.

Given that p(3)=0, p(6)=0, p(10)=1, p(11)=0, and p(0)=1, explore possible rational values for p(1), p(2), p(4), p(5), p(7), p(8), p(9). For simplicity, test small rational candidates.

```python
# Explore potential rational solutions with small candidates for unknown p(n).
# We focus on consistent assignments respecting the recurrence, especially at boundary points.
from fractions import Fraction

# Known boundary conditions
p0 = Fraction(1)
p3 = Fraction(0)
p6 = Fraction(0)
p10 = Fraction(1)
p11 = Fraction(0)

# Since recursion relates p(n) to p(n+1) and p(n+2), for n<10 and n≠3,6,10:
# p(n) = (p(n+1) + p(n+2))/2

# Unknown p(1), p(2), p(4), p(5), p(7), p(8), p(9)
# We can attempt to solve these systematically, but given small domain,
# brute-force over small rational candidates

The program systematically attempts to find rational solutions to the recurrence relation with specified boundary conditions by brute-force enumeration over small integer candidate values. It checks the recurrence at various points, ensuring consistency. Since it only explores a small set of candidate values (-2 to 2), if no solutions satisfy all conditions, the program will produce no output.

Given the problem's conditions, the key constraints are:
- Boundary conditions: p(0)=1, p(3)=0, p(6)=0, p(10)=1, p(11)=0
- Recurrence: p(n) = (p(n+1)+p(n+2))/2 for n<10, excluding n=3,6,10

The current code tests only small integer candidates and requires all supposed equalities to be perfect. It finds no solutions, which suggests the parameters might need finer granularity or the recurrence involves more complex solutions.

**Judgement:**  
Since the code produces no output and the problem appears to be designed for a solution with rational numbers, the code should ideally output the answer. Its failure indicates the candidate search space is too limited, leading to rejection.

**Acceptance or rejection:** <<<False>>>

**Corrected Program:**  
To improve the chances of finding solutions, I will expand the candidate range, include fractions with denominators 1 and 2, and print the solution if found. Also, I will add a flag for early exit when a solution is found to match the "streaming" requirement.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

p0 = Fraction(1)
p3 = Fraction(0)
p6 = Fraction(0)
p10 = Fraction(1)
p11 = Fraction(0)

# Broader candidate values, including halves
candidate_vals = [Fraction(k, 2) for k in range(-4, 5)]  # -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

found_solution = False

for p1 in candidate_vals:
    for p2 in candidate_vals:
        for p4 in candidate_vals:
            for p5 in candidate_vals:
                for p7 in candidate_vals:
                    for p8 in candidate_vals:
                        for p9 in candidate_vals:
                            # Check recurrence at n=0
                            if p1 + p2 != 2 * p0:
                                continue
                            # n=1
                            if p1 != p2
[refine_program]
The problem appears to involve finding a sequence {p(n)} of rational numbers satisfying given initial conditions and recurrence relations, with certain fixed points at n=0, 3, 6, 10, 11. The challenge asks to determine the value of P2019AMCB_16, which is defined as some rational number, probably related to these values.

However, the "Program" provided is empty, and the enumerated answers are "Error: Program is empty," meaning the code does not perform any computation or enumeration.

Given the problem constraints, the goal is likely to find the value of p(16) given these conditions, but since no code is provided, including no enumeration or computation, the answer cannot be derived.

Based on the constraints:

- The problem is a typical recurrence with specified points.
- Since the code is missing, the program cannot produce any answers, and thus, it cannot be accepted in its current form.

**Conclusion:** The original program is rejected because it does not perform any computation or enumeration.

---

Here's a corrected approach: I will construct a Python program that:

- Defines the relevant initial points and recurrence.
- Attempts to reconstruct the sequence p(n) for n ≥ 0.
- Uses the recurrence to determine p(1), p(2), ..., p(16).
- Uses the fixed points provided.
- Prints p(16) at the end.

Note: Since the recurrence involves n<10, and the fixed points at n=0,3,6,10,11, I will assume the sequence is determined uniquely.

```python
# Python code to compute p(16) based on given conditions and recurrence.
# The recurrence is: for n<10, n≠3,6,10,
# p(n) = (p(n+1) + p(n+2)) / 2

# Given fixed points:
p_values = {
    0: 1,
    3: 0,
    6: 0,
    10: 1,
    11: 0
}

# Initialize p with known points; for others, set as None initially
max_n = 16
p = [None] * (max_n + 1)

for n, val in p_values.items():
    p[n] = val

# Since recurrence relates p(n), p(n+1), p(n+2), work backwards from known points
# We can attempt
