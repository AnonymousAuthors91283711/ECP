The problem involves finding non-negative integers \(b, r, g, c\) satisfying:

\[
b + r + g + c = 280,
\]
with the constraints:
\[
r = 2b,\quad g = 3c,\quad c = 4r.
\]

We need to enumerate solutions to determine possible values of \(c\), then find the corresponding parameters.

Given \(c = 4r\) and \(r = 2b\):
- \(c = 4 \times 2b = 8b\).

Replacing into the sum:
\[
b + r + g + c = 280,
\]
\[
b + 2b + 3c + c = 280,
\]
\[
b + 2b + 3c + c = 280,
\]
\[
3b + 4c = 280.
\]

Since \(c = 8b\),
\[
3b + 4 \times 8b = 280,
\]
\[
3b + 32b = 280,
\]
\[
35b = 280,
\]
\[
b = 8.
\]

Now, with \(b=8\),
\[
r = 2b = 16,
\]
\[
c = 8b = 64,
\]
\[
g = 3c = 192.
\]

Sum check:
\[
8 + 16 + 192 + 64 = 280,
\]
which is correct.

So the only solution corresponds to these values, and the value of \(c\) is 64.

Here's a Python script that searches for all feasible \(b\) and corresponding \(c\), \(r\), \(g\), but as we've analytical solution, it confirms \(c=64\).

```python
# Enumerate all possible b values up to 280//35 (max b)
for b in range(0, 280 // 35 + 1):
    if 35 * b == 280:
        c = 8 * b
        r = 2 * b
        g = 3 * c
        total = b + r + g + c
        if total == 280:
            print(f"b={b}, r={r}, g={g}, c={c}")
            print(f"c value found: {c}")
```

This script verifies the analytical solution and outputs the candidate.
