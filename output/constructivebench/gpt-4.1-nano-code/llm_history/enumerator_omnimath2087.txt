The problem asks to find the least natural number \( c \) such that there exist distinct \( a, b \) satisfying certain divisibility and triangle inequalities, with additional constraints on divisibility by 42 and 72, and inequalities involving their sums.

To approach this efficiently:
- Enumerate small values of \( c \), checking for the existence of \( a, b \).
- For each \( c \), find suitable pairs \( a, b \) satisfying the divisibility, distinctness, and inequalities.
- Since \( 42 \) and \( 72 \) are divisors, focus on multiples of these numbers.
- Keep track of the minimal \( c \) that satisfies the conditions.

Below is the code to perform this enumeration efficiently:

```python
# Enumerates small c's to find the least c satisfying the conditions
def main():
    # Since 42 and 72 are fixed divisors, consider their multiples
    # Precompute potential a, b within reasonable ranges
    max_c = 200  # limit for c to prevent overly long runtime
    for c in range(1, max_c + 1):
        found = False
        # Find potential a, b satisfying divisibility conditions
        for a in range(42, 3 * max_c, 42):  # multiples of 42
            for b in range(72, 3 * max_c, 72):  # multiples of 72
                if a != b and b != c and a != c:
                    # Check triangle inequalities
                    if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:
                        # Check divisibility
                        if a % 42 == 0 and b % 72 == 0:
                            print(f"Found c={c} with a={a}, b={b}")
                            print(f"Conditions: 42|{a}, 72|{b}, {a}≠{b}≠{c}")
                            print(f"Sum inequalities: {a}+{b}>{c}, {a}+{c}>{b}, {b}+{c}>{a}")
                            found = True
                            break
            if found:
                # Since we are searching for least c, print and break
                return
main()
```
