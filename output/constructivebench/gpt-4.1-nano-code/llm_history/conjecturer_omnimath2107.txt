2019. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests n must divide the common factors of 2019 and n^2, which is n. Since totient(2019 * n) = totient(n^2), n divides 2019 as 2019 is fixed. The key divisors are 1, 3, 673, 2019. But n > 0 and divisibility constraints imply n ∈ {1, 2019}. Among given answers, 2019 matches.
