This problem appears to involve combinatorial coloring of a 4x4 grid with a particular constraint involving L-shaped trominoes, trying to find the maximum size `n` of such a set. For computational feasibility, I'll limit the enumeration to small scenarios and check configurations to estimate the largest `n`.

Since the problem is about finding the greatest number of points in the grid that can be colored with some coloring satisfying the given L-tromino conditions, I will:

- Generate all possible colorings for small sets of points.
- Check for each subset whether the condition holds.
- Keep track of the largest subset satisfying the condition.

Because for large sets the enumeration is exponential, I'll restrict the grid points to a small subset (e.g., 4x4 grid points) and small coloring options (3 colors). I will generate all colorings, check each for the conditions, and output the largest set size.

Here's the Python code:

```python
import itertools

# Define grid points: all points in 4x4 grid
grid_points = [(i, j) for i in range(4) for j in range(4)]

# Generate all possible colorings of the grid with 3 colors
colorings = []
for coloring in itertools.product(range(3), repeat=len(grid_points)):
    # Map positions to colors
    color_map = dict(zip(grid_points, coloring))
    colorings.append(color_map)

# Function to check if a set of points satisfies the L-tromino condition
def check_condition(points, color_map):
    # For each combination of three points, check if they form an L
    for ptriplet in itertools.combinations(points, 3):
        (i1,j1), (i2,j2), (i3,j3) = ptriplet
        c1 = color_map[(i1,j1)]
        c2 = color_map[(i2,j2)]
        c3 = color_map[(i3,j3)]
        # Check for L-shape in one of 8 orientations
        # Conditions based on coordinate relations
        if ((i1 == i2 and j2 == j3 and j1 == j2 + 1 and i3 == i2 + 1) or
            (i1 == i2 and j2 == j3 and j1 == j2 - 1 and i3 == i2 + 1) or
            (i1 == i2 and j2 == j3 and j1 == j2 + 1 and i3 == i2 - 1) or
            (i1 == i2 and j2 == j3 and j1 == j2 - 1 and i3 == i2 - 1) or
            (j1 == j2 and i2 == i3 and i1 == i2 + 1 and j3 == j2 + 1) or
            (j1 == j2 and i2 == i3 and i1 == i2 - 1 and j3 == j2 + 1) or
            (j1 == j2 and i2 == i3 and i1 == i2 + 1 and j3 == j2 - 1) or
            (j1 == j2 and i2 == i3 and i1 == i2 - 1 and j3 == j2 - 1)):
            # Check if all colors are distinct
            if len({c1, c2, c3}) == 3:
                return True
    return False

max_size = 0

# For each subset size, check for a valid coloring
for size in range(len(grid_points), 0, -1):
    found = False
    for subset in itertools.combinations(grid_points, size):
        subset_points = list(subset)
        # Check all colorings of the subset
        for coloring in itertools.product(range(3), repeat=size):
            color_map = dict(zip(subset_points, coloring))
            # Check all triples in subset
            if check_condition(subset_points, color_map):
                print(f"Maximum subset size with valid coloring: {size}")
                max_size = size
                found = True
                break
        if found:
            break
    if found:
        break

print(f"Estimated maximum size: {max_size}")
```
