This problem involves solving a recurrence relation defined over the integers: \(f(x) = f(x-1) + f(x+1)\), with initial conditions \(f(1)=1\) and \(f(2)=3\). To find \(f(2008)\), we need to understand the pattern generated by this recurrence.

Analyzing the recurrence:
\[ f(x) = f(x-1) + f(x+1) \]
Rearranged:
\[ f(x+1) = f(x) - f(x-1) \]
This is a second-order linear recurrence with constant coefficients:
\[ f_{n+1} = f_{n} - f_{n-1} \]

Initial conditions:
\[ f(1) = 1 \]
\[ f(2) = 3 \]

Compute a few terms:
- \(f(3) = f(2) - f(1) = 3 - 1 = 2\)
- \(f(4) = f(3) - f(2) = 2 - 3 = -1\)
- \(f(5) = f(4) - f(3) = -1 - 2 = -3\)
- \(f(6) = f(5) - f(4) = -3 - (-1) = -2\)
- \(f(7) = f(6) - f(5) = -2 - (-3) = 1\)

We see a pattern:
\[ f(1)=1, f(2)=3, f(3)=2, f(4)=-1, f(5)=-3, f(6)=-2, f(7)=1, ... \]

The sequence appears to be periodic:
\[ 1, 3, 2, -1, -3, -2, 1, 3, 2, -1, ... \]
Repetition every 6 terms.

Check explicitly:
\[ f(n+6) = f(n) \]

Indeed, pattern repeats every 6 terms:
- \(f(1)=1\)
- \(f(2)=3\)
- \(f(3)=2\)
- \(f(4)=-1\)
- \(f(5)=-3\)
- \(f(6)=-2\)
- then \(f(7)=1\), and so on.

Therefore, \(f(n)\) is periodic with period 6. To find \(f(2008)\):

Compute \(2008 \bmod 6\):
\[ 2008 \div 6 = 334 \text{ remainder } 4 \]
Since:
- \(f(1) \equiv 1\)
- \(f(2) \equiv 3\)
- \(f(3) \equiv 2\)
- \(f(4) \equiv -1\)
- \(f(5) \equiv -3\)
- \(f(0) \equiv -2\) (by extension)

So:
\[ f(2008) = f(\text{[remainder]}) = f(4) = -1 \]

---

Below is a Python program to verify and enumerate the sequence:

```python
# Sequence pattern repeats every 6:
pattern = [1, 3, 2, -1, -3, -2]

# Compute f(2008):
n = 2008
remainder = n % 6
answer = pattern[remainder - 1]  # Adjust for zero-based index
print(answer)

# Enumerate the pattern up to 12 terms to verify periodicity:
for i in range(1, 13):
    print(f"f({i}) = {pattern[(i-1) % 6]}")
```
