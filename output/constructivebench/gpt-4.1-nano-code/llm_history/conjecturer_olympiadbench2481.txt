theorem olympiadbench2481 :
  Finset.sum (Finset.Icc 4 6) (fun k => (Nat.choose 6 k : ℝ) * (1/2)^6) = olympiadbench2481_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Probability for k=4: 0.234375
Probability for k=5: 0.09375
Probability for k=6: 0.015625
Sum of probabilities from k=4 to 6: 0.34375. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The probabilities are based on Binomial distribution with p=1/2. Summing for k=4 to 6, the total probability is (1/2)^6 * (Nat.choose 6 4 + Nat.choose 6 5 + Nat.choose 6 6) = (1/64) * (15 + 6 + 1) = (1/64) * 22 = 11/32. So, the closed form is 11/32. 
Thus,

<<<(11 / 32 : ℝ)>>>
