The problem involves permutations of a finite set of size 5, considering the list of images of 0..4 under the permutation, and examining the sum of the images at certain positions. The goal is to find the value (probably minimum or maximum) of the number of permutations satisfying the inequality: l[0]! + l[1]! < l[3]! + l[4]! where l = p applied to [0,1,2,3,4].

To assist in conjecturing and proving, we will enumerate all permutations (there are only 120 permutations of 5 elements), compute the sums, and count those that satisfy the inequality. Then, we can determine the total count.

```python
from itertools import permutations

# Set the size of the permutation
n = 5

# Generate all permutations of 0..4
all_perms = list(permutations(range(n)))

count = 0
for p in all_perms:
    l = p
    sum1 = (l[0]+1) + (l[1]+1)  # 1-based factorials
    sum2 = (l[3]+1) + (l[4]+1)
    if sum1 < sum2:
        print(f"Permutation: {l}, sum1: {sum1}, sum2: {sum2}")
        count += 1

print(f"Total permutations satisfying the inequality: {count}")
```
