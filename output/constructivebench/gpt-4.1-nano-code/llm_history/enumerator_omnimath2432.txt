The problem asks to analyze the set of values \( y = \frac{a b + b^2}{a^2 + b^2} \) for positive real numbers \( a, b > 0 \), and to find its possible range. The goal is to compute the extremal values (minimum and maximum) that this expression can take over positive reals by enumeration to assist in conjecturing and eventually proving the range.

Approach:
- Fix a small range of positive \( a, b \), e.g., \( a, b \in \{0.1, 0.2, \ldots, 10\} \).
- Iterate over these values to compute \( y \).
- Track minimal and maximal \( y \) values found.
- Print each value as soon as it is computed.
- Finally, explicitly print the discovered bounds for the range.

This allows a heuristic exploration to suggest the possible image of the function.

```python
# Enumerate over a grid of positive a, b to approximate the range of (a*b + b^2)/(a^2 + b^2)
import math

# Step size and range for parameters
start, end, step = 0.1, 10.0, 0.1

min_y = math.inf
max_y = -math.inf

for a in [i/10 for i in range(int(start*10), int(end*10)+1)]:
    for b in [j/10 for j in range(int(start*10), int(end*10)+1)]:
        denom = a**2 + b**2
        y = (a*b + b**2) / denom
        print(f"a={a:.2f}, b={b:.2f}, y={y:.4f}")  # print current computed value
        if y < min_y:
            min_y = y
        if y > max_y:
            max_y = y

# Print the approximate extremal bounds found
print(f"Approximate minimum y: {min_y}")
print(f"Approximate maximum y: {max_y}")
```
