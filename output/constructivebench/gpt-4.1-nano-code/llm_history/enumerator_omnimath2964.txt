The problem involves a set of numbers and injective circle assignments, with certain conditions. To help conjecture and identify omnimath2964_answer, I will systematically enumerate all possible injective assignments for the circles, respecting the constraints that each circle's value is in the given set, and the average condition indicates equal sums over three groups.

Given the small set and the enumeration task, I will:
- Use small values for circles.
- Enumerate all injective functions (permutations).
- Check the sum equalities and the presence of 13 and 17.
- When conditions are satisfied, print the corresponding answer (the value of `omnimath2964_answer`), which will be the value assigned to some circle satisfying the conditions, as an example.

Since the code must be concise and efficient, I will:
- Loop over permutations of the set taken 9 at a time.
- For each permutation, map indices 0..8 to assigned values.
- Check conditions.
- Upon satisfying the conditions, output the value of the specific circle involved in the answer.

```python
import itertools

# Define the set of numbers
numbers = {1,5,6,7,13,14,17,22,26}
numbers_list = list(numbers)

# Enumerate all injective assignments for circles (indices 0..8)
for perm in itertools.permutations(numbers_list, 9):
    circles = list(perm)
    # Check for presence of 13 and 17
    if 13 not in circles or 17 not in circles:
        continue
    # Check for the average conditions
    sum0 = circles[0] + circles[1] + circles[2]
    sum1 = circles[3] + circles[4] + circles[5]
    sum2 = circles[6] + circles[7] + circles[8]
    avg0 = sum0 / 3
    avg1 = sum1 / 3
    avg2 = sum2 / 3
    if avg0 == avg1 == avg2:
        # Output the result, for example, the value of circles[k] where the condition holds
        # Let's pick the circle with 13 as an example
        idx_13 = circles.index(13)
        answer_value = circles[idx_13]
        print(answer_value)
```
