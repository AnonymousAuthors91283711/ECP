(3, 4, 3). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)
The pattern suggests solutions where \(a^p = (b)! + p\) with small primes \(p\), especially \(p=2\) and \(p=3\), and small positive integers \(a, b\). For \(p=2\), the solutions are \((a,b,p) = (2,2,2)\); for \(p=3\), \((3,4,3)\) fits since \(3^3=27\) and \(4!+3=24+3=27\). Considering the minimal such solutions and the pattern, the general form likely involves these small primes with minimal \(a,b\).

<<<{(a, b, p) | (a = 2 ∧ b = 2 ∧ p = 2) ∨ (a = 3 ∧ b = 4 ∧ p = 3)}>>>
