This problem involves calculating an expression related to sum of fractions, then taking its reciprocal and multiplying by 10. To assist in conjecturing, I'll directly enumerate the exact values for the sum and its inverse, then compute the final answer. Since there's no need for parameter variation or optimization beyond straightforward evaluation, we'll compute the exact value step-by-step and print it immediately.

```python
# Python program to compute the value of 10 * (1/2 + 1/5 + 1/10)^(-1) and output it immediately

# Compute the sum inside the parentheses
sum_fractions = (1/2) + (1/5) + (1/10)
print(f"Sum of fractions: {sum_fractions}")

# Compute the reciprocal of the sum
inverse_sum = 1 / sum_fractions
print(f"Inverse of the sum: {inverse_sum}")

# Compute the final answer
answer = 10 * inverse_sum
print(f"Final answer: {answer}")
```
