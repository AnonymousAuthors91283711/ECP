Given the symmetry and the conditions, the expression simplifies with \( a, b, c \) as positive real numbers satisfying the given equations. The sum \( a + b + c = 26 \) and reciprocals sum \( 1/a + 1/b + 1/c = 28 \) suggest the symmetric sums relate to the roots of a cubic polynomial linked to these variables.

From the pattern and symmetry, the sum \( S = a/b + b/c + c/a + a/c + c/b + b/a \) can be viewed as pairs of reciprocals, which can be simplified via symmetric polynomial identities. The established formulas for symmetric sums imply:

\[
a/b + b/c + c/a + a/c + c/b + b/a = (a + b + c)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c) - 3
\]

Plugging in the known sums:

\[
= 26 \times 28 - 3 = 728 - 3 = 725
\]

Therefore, the answer is:

<<<725>>>
