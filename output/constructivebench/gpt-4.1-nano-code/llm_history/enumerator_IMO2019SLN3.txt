The problem appears to involve a set \( S \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \), a condition involving powers of 2, and a polynomial evaluation property. The key part looks like characterizing which integers are in \( S \) based on evaluations of certain polynomials with coefficients in \( S \).

Given the problem's structure:
- The set \( S \) contains elements related via differences of powers of 2.
- The property involving polynomial evaluation likely characterizes roots of polynomials with coefficients from \( S \).

Since the problem asks for enumerating possible answers to conjecture and verify the nature of \( S \) based on the given conditions, and the formula:

\[ ∀ (n, a: \text{Fin}(n+1) \to ℤ), \text{ if } ∀i, a(i) ∈ S,\; \text{and } R(r) = 0, \text{ then } r ∈ S \]

This appears to determine \( S \) as the set of elements that are roots of such polynomial evaluations, given the constraints.

A key step in the puzzle is understanding the set \( S \). Based on the initial condition involving powers of 2,

\[ ∀ a, b ∈ ℕ,\; 0 < a, 0 < b,\; (2^a - 2^b) ∈ S \]

it suggests that differences of powers of 2 are in \( S \). Since powers of 2 grow rapidly and their differences can be numerous, one natural candidate for \( S \) is the set of all integers that can be expressed as differences of powers of 2.

Let me attempt to enumerate all such differences for small exponents, to see what elements appear.

I will pick small \( a, b \in \{1, 2, 3\} \) to list such elements, then check whether these differences are likely to generate the entire set.

```python
# Enumerate differences of powers of 2 for small exponents
differences = set()
max_exp = 4  # Small limit for small samples
for a in range(1, max_exp):
    for b in range(1, max_exp):
        if a != b:
            diff = 2**a - 2**b
            differences.add(diff)
            # Also add the negative difference
            differences.add(-diff)

print("Possible differences of powers of 2 for small exponents:")
for d in sorted(differences):
    print(d)
# Based on this, candidate set S includes all such differences,
# possibly all integers that can be represented as sums of these differences or their negatives.
# For simplicity, assume S could be the set of all integers that are differences of powers of 2 for small exponents.

# For a more extensive enumeration, list all differences up to a certain bound.
# But since the problem is high-level, we observe these key differences:
```

This code enumerates differences of powers of 2 for small exponents, giving insight into the structure of \( S \). The actual set \( S \) might be the set of all such differences, as generated or their integer combinations. The core idea is to understand the relation between \( S \) and differences of powers of two, then use polynomial evaluation properties to confirm whether these generate \( S \).

This enumeration helps conjecture that \( S \) includes all such differences and possibly the set of all integers obtainable from them, aligning with the conditions involving polynomial roots.
