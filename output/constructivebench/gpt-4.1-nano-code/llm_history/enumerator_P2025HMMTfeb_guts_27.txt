This problem involves analyzing a function \(f:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) defined by recursive relations, specifically:

- \(f(0) = 0\),
- for \(m > 0\), \(f(m) = f\left(\frac{m}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{m}{2} + 1\right)^2\).

The goal appears to be to find the sum:

\[
\sum_{m=1}^{31} \frac{f(m)}{m(m+1)}.
\]

Given the recursive structure, the challenge is to compute \(f(m)\) for each \(m\) efficiently, respecting the integer division and the conditions.

### Strategy:
- We will create a recursive function to compute \(f(m)\), memoized for efficiency.
- Since \(f(m)\) depends on \(f(\lfloor m/2 \rfloor)\), and the problem is at \(m \leq 31\), small enough to directly compute.
- Sum each term of the sum as we go, ensuring immediate output for each answer.
- Since only approximate or exact sum is asked, we will output intermediate sums and the final sum.
- Abide by the streaming and efficiency requirements.

### Implementation:
- Use a dictionary for memoization.
- Loop through \(m = 1\) to 31, compute \(f(m)\), and sum \(\frac{f(m)}{m(m+1)}\).
- Print each computed term immediately, as well as the overall sum once done.

```python
def main():
    from fractions import Fraction
    memo = {0: 0}

    def f(m):
        if m in memo:
            return memo[m]
        half = m // 2
        val = f(half) + (half + 1) ** 2
        memo[m] = val
        return val

    total = Fraction(0, 1)
    for m in range(1, 32):
        fm = f(m)
        term = Fraction(fm, m * (m + 1))
        print(f"m={m}, f(m)={fm}, term={term}")
        total += term

    print(f"Total sum: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
