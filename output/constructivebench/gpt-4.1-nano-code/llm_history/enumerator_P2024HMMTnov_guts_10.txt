This problem is asking us to find the greatest prime divisor of a specific number: \( 3^{12} + 3^9 + 3^5 + 1 \). To solve this, we need to factor this number into its prime factors and determine the largest one.

Steps:
1. Compute \( 3^{12} + 3^9 + 3^5 + 1 \).
2. Factor this sum into prime factors.
3. Find the maximum prime factor.

To assist in conjecturing, we will:
- Calculate the number.
- Attempt to factor it systematically, starting with small primes.
- Whenever a factor is found, divide out all occurrences.
- Keep track of prime factors found.
- Output each prime factor as it is discovered and the current maximum prime factor.

This approach ensures we stream partial results, prioritize exact factors, and do efficient checks.

```python
# Efficiently factor the number by testing prime divisors up to its square root
import math

# Calculate the number
value = 3**12 + 3**9 + 3**5 + 1
print(f"Number to factor: {value}")

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n in (2, 3):
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    limit = int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1
    for i in range(3, limit, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

candidate = value
max_prime_factor = None

# Start checking small primes
for p in range(2, int(math.isqrt(candidate)) + 1):
    if p == 2 or p % 2 != 0:  # check only 2 and odd numbers
        while candidate % p == 0:
            print(f"Found prime factor: {p}")
            candidate //= p
            if is_prime(p):
                max_prime_factor = p
        if candidate == 1:
            break

# If remaining candidate > 1, it is prime itself
if candidate > 1:
    print(f"Found prime factor: {candidate}")
    max_prime_factor = candidate

print(f"Greatest prime factor: {max_prime_factor}")
```
