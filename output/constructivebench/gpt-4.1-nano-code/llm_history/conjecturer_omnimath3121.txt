  IsLeast {d : ℕ | ∃ a b, a * b = 2010 ∧ a > b ∧ d = a - b} omnimath3121_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Minimal difference d: None. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The minimal difference d occurs when a and b are as close as possible, with a > b and a * b = 2010. Factoring 2010: 2010 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 67. The closest factors are 45 and 44 with difference 1. 

Final answer: <<<1>>>
