The pattern shows pairs where t and u satisfy t^2 + 10u = u^2 + 10t with t, u digits and n = 10t + u, with n prime. The solutions 11, 19, 37, 73 correspond to solutions with t ≠ u, as well as the symmetric ones. 

The set of all such n, considering the symmetry, is {10t + u | t, u ∈ ℕ, 1 ≤ t, u ≤ 9, t ≠ u, t^2 + 10 u = u^2 + 10 t, and n is prime}. From enumeration, it simplifies to n = 11, 19, 37, 73, i.e., the set:
