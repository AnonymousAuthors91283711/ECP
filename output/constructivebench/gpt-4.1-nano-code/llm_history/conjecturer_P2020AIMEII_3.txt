abbrev P2020AIMEII_3_answer : ℕ × ℕ := sorry
theorem P2020AIMEII_3 :
  ∃! (x : ℝ), ∃ (m n : ℕ), Nat.Coprime m n ∧ x = m / n ∧
  log (3^20) / log (2^x) = log (3^2020) / log (2^(x+3)) ∧
  m + n = (P2020AIMEII_3_answer.fst + P2020AIMEII_3_answer.snd) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (3, 100)
Sum: 103. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
The pattern suggests that m and n satisfy a relation where m + n equals the sum of the two enumerated answers, likely 3 + 100, and are coprime integers fulfilling the equation's conditions. Since the sum is 103, the entire relation reduces to the sum of coprime integers 3 and 100, which are coprime, satisfying the sum condition.
