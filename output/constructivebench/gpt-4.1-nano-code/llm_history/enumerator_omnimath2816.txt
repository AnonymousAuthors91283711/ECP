This problem involves solving for \( x \) in the equation \(\frac{x}{100} \times 60 = 12\), then computing \(\frac{15}{100} \times x\). To assist in conjecture and discovery, the program will enumerate possible approximate solutions for \( x \), and then calculate the corresponding value of \(\frac{15}{100} \times x\). Since the equation is linear, the exact solution is straightforward, but for the purpose of enumeration, we will consider a small sample of possible \( x \) values around the approximate solution.

The exact solution:
\[
\frac{x}{100} \times 60 = 12 \implies x \times 0.6 = 12 \implies x = \frac{12}{0.6} = 20
\]

We will generate candidate \( x \) values near 20, e.g., from 18 to 22 in steps of 0.1, check which satisfy the equation closely, then compute \(\frac{15}{100} \times x\).

```python
# Enumerate candidate x values near the exact solution 20
# Check for approximate solutions to the equation (x/100)*60 ≈ 12
# Then compute (15/100)*x for each candidate

import math

# Parameters for enumeration
start, end, step = 18.0, 22.0, 0.1
tolerance = 0.01  # allowable deviation

for x in [start + i*step for i in range(int((end - start)/step) + 1)]:
    lhs = (x / 100) * 60
    # Check if lhs is approximately 12
    if abs(lhs - 12) <= tolerance:
        answer = (15 / 100) * x
        print(f"x ≈ {x:.2f}, (x/100)*60 ≈ {lhs:.2f}, (15/100)*x ≈ {answer:.2f}")
```
