. Enumerated answers: (x=1, y=0, z=0, w=0)
(x=1, y=1, z=1, w=0)
(x=2, y=2, z=1, w=1)
(x=3, y=0, z=0, w=1). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)
The pattern suggests specific solutions with small exponents satisfying \(2^x 3^y - 5^z 7^w = 1\). Observing the enumerated solutions, the solutions with minimal exponents are (1,0,0,0), (1,1,1,0). The next appears at higher exponents with pattern 2,2,1,1. All these solutions follow a specific small exponential form, indicating they are all solutions. Therefore, the general set is exactly those solutions with these specific tuples.
