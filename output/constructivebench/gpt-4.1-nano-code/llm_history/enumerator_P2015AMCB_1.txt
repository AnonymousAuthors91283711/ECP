This appears to be a problem from a contest asking for the value of an expression involving rational numbers and powers. The expression is `2 - (-2)^(-2)`. To solve this, we can analyze the components:

- `(-2)^(-2)` is `1 / (-2)^2` = `1 / 4` = `0.25`.
- So, `2 - 0.25 = 1.75`.

Since the problem is expressed in rational arithmetic, the answer should be `7/4`.

To verify, we'll write a Python script that computes this expression exactly and verifies the rational value.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Compute (-2)^(-2) as a rational number
base = Fraction(-2)
exponent = -2

# (-2)^(-2) = 1 / (-2)^2 = 1/4
value = Fraction(1, base ** (-exponent))
# Since base ** (-exponent) = (-2)^2 = 4
# value = 1/4

# Final expression: 2 - (-2)^(-2)
result = Fraction(2) - value

print("Answer as a rational:", result)
# For explicit float approximation
print("Approximate decimal:", float(result))
```
