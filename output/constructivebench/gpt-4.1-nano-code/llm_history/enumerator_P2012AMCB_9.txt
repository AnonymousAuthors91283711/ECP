To analyze this problem, it appears to involve a function P2012AMCB_9_answer that depends on two real parameters, t_walk and t_move, with given values t_walk = 60 and t_move = 24. The theorem states that under these values, the function outputs 40, but since the implementation is not provided ("sorry"), we will attempt to conjecture the possible answers by querying the function over some sample input values.

Given the structure, the primary goal is to generate candidate answers for various t_walk and t_move values, especially around the given example 60 and 24, to observe the output.

Since the problem is high-school level, I assume the function represents some relation involving walking and moving times, perhaps calculating distances or rates. Without specifics, we'll explore a small grid of plausible parameters near the provided values.

To proceed, I will:
- Generate a set of t_walk and t_move values around the given values.
- Compute the function for these values.
- Print the results immediately as I compute them.

Note: Since P2012AMCB_9_answer is noncomputable ("sorry"), in actual code I will mock this function with some sample functions to simulate outputs, as I cannot invoke undefined functions. For demonstration purposes, I will assume a linear relationship or similar, although in practice, this should be replaced with actual logic or left as a placeholder.

```python
# Since the actual function is not defined, we'll simulate possible outputs with a mock function.
# This mock assumes that for inputs near (60,24), outputs are close to 40, but explore variations.

def mock_P2012AMCB_9_answer(t_walk, t_move):
    # Hypothetical relation: for example, a weighted average plus some variation
    return round( (2/3)*t_walk + (1/3)*t_move + (t_walk - 60)*0.5 - (t_move - 24)*0.3, 2)

# Explore values around the known parameters
t_walk_values = [55, 60, 65]
t_move_values = [20, 24, 28]

for t_w in t_walk_values:
    for t_m in t_move_values:
        answer = mock_P2012AMCB_9_answer(t_w, t_m)
        print(f"t_walk={t_w}, t_move={t_m} => answer={answer}")
```
