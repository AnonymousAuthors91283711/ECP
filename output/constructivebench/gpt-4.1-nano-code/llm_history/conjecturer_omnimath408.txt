  (volume {p : ℝ × ℝ | 0 ≤ p.1 ∧ p.1 ≤ 120 ∧ 0 ≤ p.2 ∧ p.2 ≤ 120 ∧ |p.1 - p.2| ≤ 15}).toReal / (120 * 120) = omnimath408_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Estimated ratio of the region to the total square: 0.46979166666666666. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
From the ratio approximately 0.4698, the region is roughly 47%. The boundary condition |p₁ - p₂| ≤ 15 suggests a band within the 120×120 square. Geometric analysis indicates the shared area between the square and the strip equates to approximately 0.4697916667 of the total, corresponding to (35841/76240).
