The problem defines a functional equation: for all real x and y,
\[f(x + y^2) = f(x) + | y \cdot f(y) |\]
and asks to describe the solution set. The task is to find all functions \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying this.

To do this systematically, consider specific values:
- Set \(x=0\), investigate \(f(y^2)\),
- Explore \(f(0)\),
- Test whether \(f\) might be linear or constant,
- Understand how \(f\) behaves on squares and general reals.

We can implement an enumeration to find all candidate solutions by testing plausible classes:
- Constant functions,
- Linear functions,
- Piecewise behaviors based on observed patterns.

Here's a code that tests these hypotheses on finite samples, printing any solutions quickly. It explores the functions:
- \(f(x) = c\) (constant),
- \(f(x) = a x\) (linear),
- other conjectured forms as needed.

```python
import math

# We look for functions f: R -> R satisfying f(x + y^2) = f x + | y * f y |
# We'll test specific simple functions: constant and linear functions
# and verify if they satisfy the functional equation for sampled values.

# Define candidate functions
def const_fn(c):
    # Constant function: f(x)=c
    def f(x):
        return c
    return f

def linear_fn(a):
    # Linear function: f(x)=a*x
    def f(x):
        return a*x
    return f

# Test if a function satisfies the condition on some sample (x,y)
def check_fn(f, x, y):
    left = f(x + y**2)
    right = f(x) + abs(y * f(y))
    return math.isclose(left, right, rel_tol=1e-9, abs_tol=1e-9)

# Generate sample points
sample_xs = [0, 1, -1, 2.5, -2.5]
sample_ys = [0, 1, -1, 0.5, -0.5]

# Collect solutions
solutions = []

# Check constant functions
for c in [-10, 0, 10]:
    f = const_fn(c)
    if all(check_fn(f, x, y) for x in sample_xs for y in sample_ys):
        print(f"Constant solution: f(x)={c}")
        solutions.append(('constant', c))

# Check linear functions
for a in [-10, 0, 10]:
    f = linear_fn(a)
    if all(check_fn(f, x, y) for x in sample_xs for y in sample_ys):
        print(f"Linear solution: f(x)={a}*x")
        solutions.append(('linear', a))

# Additional checks can be added for functions like f(x)=0, f(x)=c, etc.
# This simulation helps conjecture solutions present in the tested class.
