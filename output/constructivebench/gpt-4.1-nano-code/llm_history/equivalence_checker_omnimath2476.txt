Ground Truth Answer: 773
Proposed Answer: 1309
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find natural numbers a and b that are coprime, where:
   - 100*a + b equals some value (omnimath2476_answer)
   - a and b are reduced fractions of isosceles/total triangles in a 2020-point set

2. Given n=2020:
   - total = n(n-1)(n-2)/6 = 2020*2019*2018/6 = 1370138680
   - isosceles = n(n-1) = 2020*2019 = 4078380
   - gcd(isosceles, total) = gcd(4078380, 1370138680) = 2020

3. Calculating a and b:
   - a = isosceles/gcd = 4078380/2020 = 2019
   - b = total/gcd = 1370138680/2020 = 678286

4. Checking coprimality:
   - gcd(2019, 678286) = gcd(2019, 678286 mod 2019) = gcd(2019, 1336) = 1 (they are coprime)

5. Calculating omnimath2476_answer:
   - 100*a + b = 100*2019 + 678286 = 201900 + 678286 = 880186

However, neither the ground truth (773) nor proposed answer (1309) matches this calculation. Both seem incorrect based on the mathematical derivation.
