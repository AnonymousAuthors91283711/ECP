[write_program]
This problem is from a high-school level competition, involving concepts like finite sets, cardinalities, and subsets, with a focus on finding the greatest element that satisfies certain conditions involving families of finite sets.

Since the code snippet is in Lean, but I am asked to write a Python program, I will interpret the problem as follows:

We are given a natural number n ≥ 4, and we need to find the largest integer m ≤ n for which there exists a family of subsets A_i (i from 0 to m−1) of Fin n (set of size n), such that:

1. Each A_i has size i + 1.
2. The A_i are pairwise incomparable by inclusion (no one is a subset of another).

Our goal: For n ≥ 4, find this greatest m satisfying the above. The problem hints that m measures the largest size of such an antichain of subsets with specified sizes.

A known combinatorial fact: For the family of subsets of an n-element set, the largest size of an antichain formed by subsets of size k is the binomial coefficient C(n,k). Here, since sizes are from 1 up to m, with sizes 1, 2, ..., m, and the sizes are increasing, we want to see how large m can be such that these subsets of sizes 1 to m exist, pairwise incomparable.

Since in general, sets of different sizes are not comparable if they are of different sizes unless one contains the other (which cannot happen here because sizes are consecutive and increasing), the only restriction is whether such a family can be constructed.

Given that, the maximum m involves choosing subsets of sizes 1 through m, each of size i+1, all mutually incomparable.

Observation:

- For each size, we can pick the "most" that satisfy the conditions. Since there are no subset relations between sets of different sizes unless one contains the other, sets of different sizes are automatically incomparable.
- Therefore, the main constraint is whether the family exists: for sizes from 1 up to m, pick one subset each.

But the problem is more subtle because the original problem seems to relate to whether the entire family exists with the specified properties, perhaps maximized over such families.

Given the parameters, the easiest approach is:

- For each n from 4 up to some limit, enumerate m candidates from 1 up to n.
- For each m, attempt to construct such a family of subsets with sizes 1, 2, ..., m, where all are pairwise incomparable.

Since all sets with different sizes automatically are incomparable, the restriction reduces to whether we can find subsets of sizes 1 to m in the set of size n.

- For each size, choose any subset of the corresponding size (e.g., randomly or systematically), which is always possible when m ≤ n because at each level, we can select different subsets.

Indeed, because sets of different sizes are incomparable unless one contains the other, and choosing disjoint subsets of the set {1,..,n} suffices, the maximum m is n as long as m ≤ n.

But the sizes go from 1 to m, and the number of subsets of each size is C(n, size). We can select one subset of each size arbitrarily.

Hence, the largest m is n itself, provided n ≥ 4.

Now, the code will find the maximum m = n for each n ≥ 4, verifying that we can always find such a family, e.g., by choosing disjoint subsets.

To demonstrate this, as an enumeration, for n=4:

- m can be up to 4 (sizes 1,2,3,4). For each, pick disjoint subsets:

  - size 1: {1}
  - size 2: {2,3}
  - size 3: {4, 5, 6} (but only have 4 elements total, so can't choose 3 disjoint sets of sizes 1..n in total). But only 4 elements.

However, with only 4 elements, choosing disjoint subsets of sizes 1, 2, 3, 4:

- sum of sizes: 1+2+3+4=10 > 4, impossible to find disjoint subsets covering sum 10.

But, the problem asks only for the existence of such a family. The key obstacle in the case of disjointness is the sum of sizes exceeding n.

But the problem states only that the sets form a family with the specified properties, including the conditions on size and subset relations. Are overlaps allowed? The question of whether sets can overlap is not specified as forbidden.

Since the only condition for the family is:

- each A_i has size i+1
- the A_i are pairwise incomparable (no one contained in another)

Given that:

- Sets of different sizes are incomparable if and only if neither is a subset of the other; since sizes differ, unless one set contains the other, they are incomparable.

- For sets of different sizes, the key is whether one is a subset of the other. If sets are disjoint, they are incomparable.

- The challenge is whether, for size m, we can construct sets of sizes 1..m, all pairwise incomparable.

Because the only potential restriction comes from the subset relation (subset inclusion), and sets of different sizes are necessarily incomparable unless one contains the other.

Thus:

- For the family {A_0, A_1, ..., A_{m-1}} with |A_i|=i+1, the only restriction is that for i ≠ j, A_i ≠ A_j, and no one contains another.

- Since for different sizes sets cannot contain each other if they are different sizes unless one is a subset of the other. For sizes 1..m, choosing them as disjoint sets suffices, which is always possible as long as the sum of their sizes does not exceed n.

But to choose disjoint subsets of sizes 1..m, sum of sizes must be ≤ n, i.e.,

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{m} i = \frac{m(m+1)}{2} \leq n
\]

This condition ensures we can pick disjoint subsets of the specified sizes.

Hence, the maximal m satisfying:

\[
\frac{m(m+1)}{2} \leq n
\]

The task:

- For n ≥ 4, find the maximum m satisfying the inequality.

- For each n, compute maximum m.

Implement an enumerator that computes this m, and thereby outputs the answer, clearly.

Let me now write the Python code that, for n from 4 up to a small limit (say 20), enumerates such maximum m, printing the parameters, confirming the maximal size m.

```python
# Enumerate the maximal m for each n ≥ 4 such that sum_{i=1}^{m} i ≤ n
# This ensures we can pick disjoint sets of sizes 1..m within n elements.

for n in range(4, 21):
    max_m = 0
    for m in range(1, n+1):
        if m*(m+1)//2 <= n:
            max_m = m
        else:
            break
    print(f"For n = {n}, maximum m such that sum 1..m ≤ n is: {max_m}")
```

This enumerates, for each n, the largest family size m with pairwise incomparable sets of sizes 1..m that can be constructed with disjoint sets.

This aligns with the combinatorial structure, satisfies the problem's conditions, and within the constraints.
