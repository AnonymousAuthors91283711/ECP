Ground Truth Answer: 96
Proposed Answer: 144
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n > 72 that has the same prime factors as 72.

2. First, factorize 72: 72 = 2³ × 3²
   So any number with the same prime factors must be of the form 2^a × 3^b where a ≥ 1 and b ≥ 1.

3. We need to find the smallest such number > 72:
   - 73-95: None have both 2 and 3 as factors
   - 96 = 2⁵ × 3¹ (this is the ground truth answer)
   - Next would be 108 = 2² × 3³
   - Then 144 = 2⁴ × 3² (the proposed answer)

4. Comparing the answers:
   - 96 is indeed smaller than 144
   - Both have the same prime factors as 72
   - 96 is the correct minimal solution

The proposed answer (144) is a valid number with the same prime factors, but it's not the smallest one greater than 72.
