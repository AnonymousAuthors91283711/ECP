The problem appears to involve analyzing the set of real numbers a for which, given some b > 0, the set {x | a * x^2 + b * x ≥ 0} matches the image of the square root function applied to a quadratic expression. To find the count of such a, the key is understanding the structure of the quadratic and the set defined by the inequality, as well as the shape of the square root range.

Given the structure, the number of such a satisfying this condition likely hinges on the properties of the quadratic (a * x^2 + b * x) and its relation to the sqrt function’s domain and image, typically resulting in a finite set of solutions. To aid conjecture, we will:
- Sample small values for a and b,
- check the set condition,
- and count how many a satisfy the set equality.

This enumeration avoids heavy computation, focusing on small ranges of a.

```python
# Enumerate candidate 'a' over a small range and check the set equality condition
import math

# Define small ranges for 'a' and 'b'
a_candidates = [i * 0.1 for i in range(-50, 51)]  # from -5.0 to 5.0 in steps of 0.1
b_candidates = [i * 0.1 for i in range(1, 11)]    # from 0.1 to 1.0 in steps of 0.1 (b > 0)

matching_a = []

for a in a_candidates:
    for b in b_candidates:
        # Check if there exists such a set: for all x where a*x^2 + b*x >= 0,
        # the set equals the range of sqrt(a*x^2 + b*x).
        # Since the condition is complex, approximate by testing a finite set of x.
        # Focus on the set of x in a finite interval, say [-10,10].
        x_vals = [i * 0.1 for i in range(-100, 101)]
        lhs_sets = set()
        rhs_sets = set()
        for x in x_vals:
            val = a * x**2 + b * x
            if val >= 0:
                lhs_sets.add(x)
                rhs_sets.add(math.sqrt(val))
        # Check if the sets are equal (allow small numerical differences)
        # We compare the images: for each x, sqrt(a*x^2 + b*x) should produce elements matching the set
        if len(lhs_sets) == 0:
            continue
        # The range of sqrt is all values from 0 to max sqrt of positive quadratic values
        range_vals = set(math.sqrt(a * x**2 + b * x) for x in x_vals if a * x**2 + b * x >= 0)
        # Now, verify if the set of image values matches the set of sqrt values calculated
        # Since the domains are continuous, but we're sampling, check for inclusion within a small tolerance
        matches = True
        for x in x_vals:
            val = a * x**2 + b * x
            if val >= 0:
                sqrt_val = math.sqrt(val)
                # Confirm sqrt_val is in the image set, within a tolerance
                if not any(abs(sqrt_val - v) < 0.05 for v in range_vals):
                    matches = False
                    break
        if matches:
            # Save 'a' that satisfies the condition
            print(f"Candidate a: {a:.2f} with b: {b:.2f}")
            matching_a.append(a)
# Output the unique 'a' values satisfying the condition (rounded)
unique_a = sorted(set(round(a,2) for a in matching_a))
print("Possible 'a' values:", unique_a)
