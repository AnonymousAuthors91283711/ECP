This problem involves analyzing the structure of two disjoint subsets A and B of natural numbers such that their union covers the interval [1, 2006], with some subset relations and closure properties under addition and multiplication. Given the constraints, the key insight is that the sets must partition the interval in a way that respects the closure conditions.

Let's reason about possible solutions:
- Since A ∪ B = [1..2006], and A ∩ B = ∅, they form a partition.
- B ⊆ A suggests B is a subset of A, meaning B's elements are contained in A.
- The properties involving addition and multiplication suggest that:  
  - For any a ∈ A, b ∈ B, a + b ∈ B if it's in the interval.  
  - For any a ∈ A, b ∈ B, a * b ∈ A if within bounds.
- To satisfy the closure properties and the subset relations, a consistent choice is B = {1}, and A = [1..2006] \ {1}.

Let's test this candidate:
- With B = {1}, and A = [2..2006], we have A ∪ B = [1..2006], A ∩ B = ∅.
- B ⊆ A? No, since B contains 1, but A starts from 2, so B ⊆ A fails.
- Alternatively, if B = {1}, then B ⊆ A? No, because 1 ∉ A.

But if we set B = {1, 2, ..., k} (for some small k), we need to check whether the closure properties hold and B ⊆ A.

The most straightforward packing is B = {1}:
- A = [2..2006]
- B = {1}
- Check conditions:
  - B ⊆ A? No, because 1 ∉ A, so discard.

Another candidate:
- B = {1, 2}
- A = [3..2006]
- B ⊆ A? No, because 1 and 2 are not in A, so discard.

It appears B must be empty for B ⊆ A? No, the empty set is a subset of A, but since B ∪ A covers all [1..2006], B cannot be empty unless A covers the entire [1..2006].

Alternatively, the simplest solution:
- B = {1}
- A = [2..2006]
- B ⊆ A? No.

Thus, B must be the entire [1..2006], but then A is empty, not permitted.

Now, consider B = {1}
- A = [2..2006]
- B ⊆ A? No.

Similarly, trying B = [1..2006] yields A empty, which violates the conditions.

The main possible solution seems:
- B = {1}
- A = [2..2006]

But since B ⊆ A? No, because 1 ∉ A, so perhaps the problem does not require B ⊆ A?), actually, yes, it does per the assumptions.

Let's check the assumptions:
- h1 : B ⊆ A → B is subset of A
- Since B ⊆ A, B cannot contain elements outside A, so B cannot contain 1 if A starts from 2.

Thus, B can't be {1} (since 1 ∉ A), which contradicts earlier assumptions.

Alternatively, if A = [1..2006], B = ∅:
- B ⊆ A? Yes
- A ∪ B = [1..2006], holds
- A ∩ B = ∅, holds
- h2 and h3 are vacuously true if either B is empty or A contains all.

In this case:
- For any a ∈ A, b ∈ B (empty): vacuously true
- So the conditions hold.

Therefore, the simplest solution is:
- A = [1..2006]
- B = ∅
- Then A.ncard = 2006

Now, are there other solutions? Let's check whether B can be non-empty and satisfy all constraints.

Suppose B = {1}
- Then B ⊆ A? No, since 1 ∉ A if A = [2..2006], so discard.

Suppose B = {1, some other numbers}
- The only candidate B can be B = {1} only if 1 ∈ A, which would be A=[1..2006] \ B

But B ⊆ A? 1 ∈ A? Then, yes, if B includes 1, A must include 1 as well.

Set A = [1..2006] \ B, with B = {1, 2}
- Then A = [3..2006], B = {1, 2}
- B ⊆ A? No, because 1 ∉ A, so discard.

If B contains 1, A includes 1 only if B does not contain 1.

Thus, the only option for B to be a subset of A is if B is disjoint from A, but B ∩ A = ∅ per the initial assumptions: A ∩ B= ∅.

Great; B and A are disjoint.

Suppose B = {1}
- Then A = [2..2006]
- B ⊆ A? No.
- So discard

Similarly, B = ∅
- then A = [1..2006]
- B ⊆ A? vacuously
- B ∩ A=∅? yes
- All properties hold.

Conclusion: Without additional restrictions, the minimal solution is:

A = [1..2006], B=∅, with A.ncard=2006.

Any other solutions with B non-empty violate the B ⊆ A condition unless B is empty.

Similarly, the closure conditions are vacuously true if B=∅.

Hence, the only solution is A=[1..2006], B=∅, total cardinality = 2006.

Now, to implement an enumeration of possible solutions, considering the most general form involves B being subsets of A with B ⊆ A, and A∪ B= [1..2006], with A∩ B=0, B⊆A.

In particular, B can be any subset of [1..2006] such that B ⊆ A, and

since A = [1..2006]\ B, the only B that satisfy B ⊆ A are those with B∩A=∅, i.e., B ⊆ complement of A in [1..2006], which is B.

But B is subset of [1..2006], and A = [1..2006] \ B, so B and A are disjoint, and B ⊆ [1..2006] \ A.

So, B and A are disjoint, B ⊆ [1..2006] \ A.

Since their union is [1..2006], with A and B disjoint, as decorated, it's equivalent to choosing B first, and then setting A as the complement.

The entire spectrum of solutions comes down to:

- Choose B ⊆ [1..2006], with properties derived from closure under addition and multiplication with the set.

Given the constraints, the most natural and evident solution is the full singleton:

- B = ∅, A = [1..2006] with count 2006.

Now, if you want to envisage minimal B and corresponding A, or other partitions, the most central and simple candidate is the entire set in one piece, i.e., A = [1..2006], B=∅, with size 2006.

**Let's implement a Python code that enumerates possible A and B pairs consistent with the basic constraints, particularly focusing on the trivial solution where B=∅ and A=[1..2006].**

```python
# The code enumerates possible solutions based on the problem's constraints.
# Due to the conditions, the most straightforward solution is A = [1..2006], B = ∅.
# For the purposes of enumeration, we generate options for B as subsets of [1..2006],
# but to keep the output within tokens, we focus only on the trivial solution.

def enumerate_solutions():
    max_element = 2006
    # Only yield the trivial solution:
    A = list(range(1, max_element + 1))
    B = []
    # Output the solution size
    print(f"Solution: |A| = {len(A)}")
    print(f"A = {A}")
    print(f"B = {B}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_solutions()
```

This program straightforwardly outputs the only well-supported solution based on the initial constraints, helping to establish an upper bound and a concrete answer without complex enumeration.
