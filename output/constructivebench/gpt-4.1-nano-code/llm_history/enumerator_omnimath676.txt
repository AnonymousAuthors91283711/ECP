This problem involves finding all positive integers \(a, b, c\) satisfying specific modular conditions: 

- \(a^b \equiv 4 \pmod{10}\)
- \(b^c \equiv 2 \pmod{10}\)
- \(c^a \equiv 9 \pmod{10}\),
and then considering the sums \(a + b + c\). 

Since the problem is about modular patterns and positive integers, we can focus on small bases (\(1 \leq a, b, c \leq 20\)) to find all candidates that satisfy the conditions. We then output all sums \(a + b + c\) for such candidates, stream immediately upon discovery.

```python
# Enumerate small values of a, b, c to find triples satisfying the modular conditions.
# Focus on positive integers up to 20 for efficiency.
# For each satisfying tuple, print their sum immediately.
# Ultimately, analyze these to identify the least sum.

# Patterns for last digit of powers:
# a^b ≡ 4 mod 10, b^c ≡ 2 mod 10, c^a ≡ 9 mod 10

# Known last digit cycle patterns:
# For last digit:
# 2 -> cycles every 4: 2,4,8,6
# 3 -> 3,9,7,1
# 7 -> 7,9,3,1
# 8 -> 8,4,2,6
# 9 -> 9,1,9,1
# 4 -> 4,6,4,6

# Precompute last digits of powers for bases 1-9:
last_digit_cycles = {
    1: [1],
    2: [2,4,8,6],
    3: [3,9,7,1],
    4: [4,6],
    5: [5],
    6: [6],
    7: [7,9,3,1],
    8: [8,4,2,6],
    9: [9,1]
}

def last_digit_pow(base, exponent):
    cycle = last_digit_cycles.get(base % 10, [base % 10])
    if base == 0:
        return 0
    index = (exponent - 1) % len(cycle)
    return cycle[index]

found_sums = set()

# Enumerate all triplets with a, b, c in 1..20
for a in range(1,21):
    for b in range(1,21):
        for c in range(1,21):
            # check last digit conditions
            if (last_digit_pow(a, b) == 4 and
                last_digit_pow(b, c) == 2 and
                last_digit_pow(c, a) == 9):
                s = a + b + c
                print(s)
                found_sums.add(s)
```

This code efficiently searches small positive integers for satisfying conditions, streaming each sum when found, which can help conjecture the minimal sum or pattern.
