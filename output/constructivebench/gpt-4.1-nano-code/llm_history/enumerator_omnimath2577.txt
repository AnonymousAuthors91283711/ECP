The problem provides a system of equations involving real variables x, y, z, and asks for the greatest value of w = x * y * z satisfying those equations. The constraints involve sums and products:

1. \( x + xy + xyz = 1 \)
2. \( y + yz + xyz = 2 \)
3. \( z + xz + xyz = 4 \)

To explore solutions, I'll attempt to find all candidate solutions numerically, starting with small test values for x, y, z, and compute w, seeking the maximum.

Because it's a high school level math problem modeled at a challenge level, I'll set small bounds for x, y, z (e.g., -10 to 10), discretize and evaluate. I'll prioritize exact solutions where possible, but for efficiency, limit the search space.

```python
# Enumerate possible (x, y, z) values within a bounded range, compute w, and track maximum
max_w = float('-inf')
max_solution = None

# Step size for enumeration
step = 0.5
# Bounds for variables
lower, upper = -10, 10

for x in [i*step for i in range(int(lower/step), int(upper/step)+1)]:
    for y in [i*step for i in range(int(lower/step), int(upper/step)+1)]:
        for z in [i*step for i in range(int(lower/step), int(upper/step)+1)]:
            # Check equations
            eq1 = abs(x + x*y + x*y*z - 1)
            eq2 = abs(y + y*z + x*y*z - 2)
            eq3 = abs(z + x*z + x*y*z - 4)
            if eq1 < 0.001 and eq2 < 0.001 and eq3 < 0.001:
                w = x * y * z
                print(w)  # stream answers
                if w > max_w:
                    max_w = w
                    max_solution = (x, y, z)

# Output the maximum found
if max_solution:
    print("Maximum w:", max_w, "at (x,y,z):", max_solution)
```
