. Enumerated answers: Solution at θ ≈ 0.4952
Solution at θ ≈ 1.7060
Solution at θ ≈ 2.5777
Solution at θ ≈ 3.5201
Solution at θ ≈ 5.0075
Solution at θ ≈ 5.5432
Total approximate solutions: 6. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The solutions are approximately: 0.4952, 1.7060, 2.5777, 3.5201, 5.0075, 5.5432. The pattern indicates six solutions within the interval \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\). Thus, the total number of solutions is 6. 

Final answer:
<<<6>>>

This captures the approximate count as an exact natural number.
