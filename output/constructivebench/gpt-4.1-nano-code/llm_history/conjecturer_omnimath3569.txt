theorem omnimath3569 (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
    (f 0 + 1 = f 1 ∧ ∀ x y, f (x * y - x) + f (x + f y) = y * f x + 3) ↔ f = omnimath3569_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate solution: f(x) = 1 * x + 1. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
Based on the functional equation and the pattern from enumeration, the solution is linear with slope 1 and intercept 1. The pattern suggests the answer is \(f(x) = x + 1\). This matches the candidate solution \(f(x) = 1 \times x + 1\).
