. Enumerated answers: Found: (a=1, b=1, c=1), sum=3 (prime). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)
The pattern suggests the only solutions occur when a, b, c are minimal and all primes, with positive sums, and the divisibility conditions hold trivially. Since (a=1, b=1, c=1) satisfies all constraints and the sum is 3 (which is prime), and given the constraints' symmetry, the only such triplet is this minimal case.
