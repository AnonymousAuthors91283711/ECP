Given the condition cos(arctan x) = x and x > 0, recognize that cos(arctan x) = 1/√(1 + x²). The equation becomes x = 1/√(1 + x²). Solving for x, we get x²(1 + x²) = 1 → x^4 + x² - 1 = 0. Let y = x²: y² + y - 1 = 0, so y = (−1 + √5)/2 (positive root). Therefore, x = √((√5−1)/2). The expression for x² matches the answer.

Given the problem statement, the key condition is to find a real number \( x \) satisfying:
\[ 0 < x, \quad \cos (\arctan x) = x, \quad \text{and} \quad x^2 = \text{some constant}. \]

Analyzing these conditions:
- Since \( \cos (\arctan x) \), by trigonometric identities, is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} \).
- The equality \( \cos (\arctan x) = x \) becomes: 
  \[ x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}, \]
  which leads to:
  \[ x^2 = \frac{1}{1 + x^2}. \]
- Solving for \( x^2 \):
  \[ x^2 (1 + x^2) = 1 \Rightarrow x^4 + x^2 - 1 = 0. \]

This quadratic in \( y = x^2 \) is:
\[ y^2 + y - 1 = 0, \]
with solutions:
\[ y = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Since \( x^2 \geq 0 \), the relevant solution is:
\[ y = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}. \]

Thus, the positive root:
\[ x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}}. \]
Given \( 0 < x \), we choose the positive root:
\[ x = \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}}. \]

In Lean, the attempt is to formalize this as:
```lean
noncomputable abbrev omnimath1366_answer : ℝ := sqrt ((√5 - 1)/2)
```

However, the original proposal wrote:
```lean
(√((√5−1)/2))^2
```
which is invalid syntax since it is an attempt to square the expression and assign it as the answer, whereas based on the problem, the answer should directly be this positive root. Also, in Lean, parentheses matter, and the `√` notation is not standard in mathlib. The correct notation should be `sqrt` instead of `√`, and proper parentheses.

Therefore, the corrected final answer expression should be:

```lean
<<<sqrt ((√5 - 1)/2)>>>
```

This provides the closed-form solution for the required \( x \), satisfying all the conditions specified in the problem.

**Summary:** We rely on the algebraic derivation of the relationship between \( x \) and its square, which is connected to the quadratic involving \( y = x^2 \). The relevant positive root corresponds to \( \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}} \). This expression can directly replace `sorry` in the formal statement.
