This problem involves solving a system of equations with a parameter T, where T = 0, and finding the value of x. The equations are:

1. \( x + y = 0 \)
2. \( x^3 - y^3 = 54 + T \) with T = 0, so \( x^3 - y^3 = 54 \).

Given \( y = -x \) from the first equation, substitute into the second:

\[
x^3 - (-x)^3 = 54
\]
\[
x^3 + x^3 = 54
\]
\[
2x^3 = 54
\]
\[
x^3 = 27
\]
\[
x = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3
\]

The answer should be 3.

```python
# Enumerate possible solutions for x based on the equations and T=0
# Since the equation reduces to x^3 = 27, the real solution is x=3.
# We can verify the solution and print it immediately.

import math

# For completeness, check the cube root of 27
x_solution = round(27 ** (1/3), 5)  # Should be close to 3
print(x_solution)
```
