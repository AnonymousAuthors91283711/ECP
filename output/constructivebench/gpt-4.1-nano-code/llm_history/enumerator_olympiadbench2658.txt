This problem appears to define a scenario involving three real variables d, s, and T with some relationships, and asks to find a certain answer `olympiadbench2658_answer`, possibly based on those relationships. The theorem describes the following equations:

1) \( d = s (T + 30) \)
2) \( d = (s + 1.5) T \)

Given \( T = 100 \), the task is to find possible values for \( d \) and \( s \) satisfying these equations, and determine `olympiadbench2658_answer`.

The problem reduces to solving the system:
\[
s (T + 30) = (s + 1.5) T
\]

With \( T = 100 \):
\[
s (130) = (s + 1.5) \times 100
\]
\[
130s = 100s + 150
\]
\[
(130 - 100)s = 150
\]
\[
30s = 150
\]
\[
s = \frac{150}{30} = 5
\]

Then:
\[
d = s (T + 30) = 5 \times 130 = 650
\]

The answer likely depends on these parameters, so we can check this analytical solution and attempt small variations if needed. To meet the coding requirements, the code will compute this solution and also enumerate nearby values to explore potential variations for conjecturing.

```python
# Enumerate solutions to the system based on the given parameters
T = 100

# Derived from solving the system algebraically:
# 130s = 100s + 150 -> s = 150/30 = 5
s_exact = 150 / 30
d_exact = s_exact * (T + 30)

# Print the exact solution
print(f's = {s_exact}')
print(f'd = {d_exact}')

# To explore possible approximate solutions, vary s around 5
for delta in [-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1]:
    s_candidate = s_exact + delta
    d_candidate = s_candidate * (T + 30)  # from first equation
    print(f'Approximate candidate: s = {s_candidate:.2f}, d = {d_candidate:.2f}')

# As per the problem, define the answer as the exact computed value
olympiadbench2658_answer = d_exact
print(f'Answer: {olympiadbench2658_answer}')
```
