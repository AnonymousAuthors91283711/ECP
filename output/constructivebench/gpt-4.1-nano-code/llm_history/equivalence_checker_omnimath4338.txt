Ground Truth Answer: {n | Odd n ∧ n ≥ 3}
Proposed Answer: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
<<<Close>>>

The ground truth answer specifies all odd natural numbers ≥3, while the proposed answer only lists specific odd numbers from 1 to 9. The proposed answer is correct in spirit (focusing on odd numbers) but incomplete since it doesn't cover all odd numbers ≥3. Also, n=1 shouldn't be included as it doesn't satisfy the condition (the ground truth specifies n ≥ 3). Therefore, the answers are not fully equivalent.
