This problem involves a real-valued quadratic function \(f(x) = x^2 - 2x\) and asks for the number of solutions \( c \) such that applying \(f\) four times yields 3, i.e., \(f^{(4)}(c) = 3\). We want to find the number of such \( c \). To assist in conjecturing and verifying this, we will numerically evaluate the possible solutions by iteratively applying the inverse of \(f\) explosionally, starting from the final value 3, and enumerating all preimages through inverse branches. 

Since \(f(x) = x^2 - 2x = (x-1)^2 - 1\), the inverse involves square roots: \(f^{-1}(y) = 1 \pm \sqrt{y+1}\). We will perform a four-level preimage branching, tracking all candidate solutions. We will limit the search to a reasonable bound, e.g., preimages within \([-10, 10]\), and display all found solutions immediately.

```python
import math

# Starting point, the value after 4 iterations.
final_value = 3

# Initialize solutions at the last iteration (just the final target value).
solutions = [final_value]

# Function to get inverse branches of f(x) = (x-1)^2 - 1
def inverse_f(y):
    roots = []
    val = y + 1
    if val >= 0:
        sqrt_val = math.sqrt(val)
        roots.append(1 + sqrt_val)
        roots.append(1 - sqrt_val)
    return roots

# Perform inverse iteration four times to find preimages.
for _ in range(4):
    new_solutions = []
    for c in solutions:
        preimages = inverse_f(c)
        for pre in preimages:
            # Limit search to a plausible range for real solutions.
            if -20 <= pre <= 20:
                print(pre)
                new_solutions.append(pre)
    solutions = new_solutions
```
