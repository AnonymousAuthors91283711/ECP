[write_program]
The problem appears to be about evaluating a specific rational expression involving three variables \(a, b, c\), with given values \(a=19, b=20, c=21\). You want to find the exact value of

\[
\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca}{a + b + c}
\]

with the known assignments. 

The task is to write a Python program that computes the answer based on the given values, turns this into an exact (floating-point) value, and prints the result immediately.

```python
# Given values
a = 19
b = 20
c = 21

# Compute numerator: a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca
numerator = a**2 + b**2 + c**2 + 2*a*b + 2*b*c + 2*c*a

# Compute denominator: a + b + c
denominator = a + b + c

# Calculate the result
result = numerator / denominator

# Print the answer immediately
print(result)
```
