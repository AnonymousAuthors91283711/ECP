This problem involves analyzing the divisors of \(n = 2010^2\), counting pairs of divisors with specific properties, and then relating these counts via a ratio involving coprime integers \(m\) and \(n\). The key parts are:
- Counting total pairs of divisors
- Counting pairs where one divisor is a perfect square
- Finding a ratio of favorable pairs to total pairs that simplifies to coprime \(m/n\)
- Ensuring \(m + n = 97\)

Given the high-level logical steps, we'll:

1. Factor 2010 to find the divisors and identify which are perfect squares.
2. Explicitly enumerate the divisors and classify them.
3. Calculate the relevant counts and ratios.
4. Find the pair \((m, n)\) that satisfies the coprimality and sum condition.

Let's implement this approach efficiently in Python, keeping it within token limits and streaming outputs.

```python
# Enumerate divisors of 2010^2, identify squares, count pairs, and find the ratio.
# 2010 factors: 2 * 3 * 5 * 67; exponents doubled in 2010^2.
from math import gcd
from itertools import combinations

# Factor 2010
factors = [2, 3, 5, 67]
exponents = [2, 2, 2, 2]  # For 2010^2

# Generate all divisors
def generate_divisors(primes, exps):
    divs = [1]
    for p, e in zip(primes, exps):
        new_divs = []
        for d in divs:
            for power in range(e + 1):
                new_divs.append(d * (p ** power))
        divs = new_divs
    return sorted(set(divs))

divisors = generate_divisors(factors, exponents)
total_pairs = len(divisors) * (len(divisors) - 1) // 2

# Identify perfect squares
square_divisors = [d for d in divisors if int(d**0.5) ** 2 == d]
non_square_divisors = [d for d in divisors if d not in square_divisors]

# Count pairs where one divisor is a perfect square and the other isn't
# For each square divisor d_s, count non-square divisors d_n
favorable_pairs_count = 0
for d_s in square_divisors:
    for d_n in non_square_divisors:
        favorable_pairs_count += 1

# Compute ratio
ratio_num = favorable_pairs_count
ratio_den = total_pairs

# Find m, n such that ratio = m/n (simplified), m, n coprime, m + n = 97
common_div = gcd(ratio_num, ratio_den)
m_candidate = ratio_num // common_div
n_candidate = ratio_den // common_div

# Ensure coprimality
if gcd(m_candidate, n_candidate) == 1 and m_candidate + n_candidate == 97:
    print(m_candidate, n_candidate)
else:
    print("No suitable (m,n) found with sum 97.")

# Assuming a solution exists, the printed pair is the answer.
```
