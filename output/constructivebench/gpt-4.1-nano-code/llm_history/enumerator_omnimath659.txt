Given the problem, we're dealing with the number n = 20 * (13!), and we want to find the first non-zero digit from the right after reversing its digits.

To assist with the conjecture, we'll compute n explicitly, reverse its digits, and find the first non-zero digit from the right. We'll output each candidate digit immediately as we explore, prioritizing exact digits.

```python
# Calculate 13! to avoid large factorial calculation repeatedly
import math

# Compute n = 20 * 13!
n = 20 * math.factorial(13)

# Convert n to string to work with digits
n_str = str(n)

# Reverse the digits
reversed_digits = n_str[::-1]

# Find the first non-zero digit from the reversed number
for digit_char in reversed_digits:
    if digit_char != '0':
        answer = int(digit_char)
        print(answer)
        break
```
