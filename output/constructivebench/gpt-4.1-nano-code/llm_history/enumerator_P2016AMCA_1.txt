This problem involves algebraic simplification of an expression with factorials: (11! - 10!) / 9!. We can simplify algebraically first:  
11! = 11 * 10!, so the numerator becomes 11 * 10! - 10! = 10!(11 - 1) = 10! * 10.  
Now dividing by 9!: since 10! = 10 * 9!, it simplifies to (10 * 9!) / 9! = 10.

To programmatically enumerate, we can check the expression for small factorial values to see how it simplifies. Since the problem asks for an answer in Lean syntax, but for Python, we'll compute actual values.

The task is straightforward: compute (11! - 10!) / 9! and print the answer immediately.

```python
import math

# Compute factorials
fact_9 = math.factorial(9)
fact_10 = math.factorial(10)
fact_11 = math.factorial(11)

# Calculate the numerator
numerator = fact_11 - fact_10

# Compute the answer
answer = numerator // fact_9

# Print the answer immediately
print(f"{answer}")
```
