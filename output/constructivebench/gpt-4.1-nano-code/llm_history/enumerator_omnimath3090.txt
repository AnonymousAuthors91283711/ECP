This problem involves solving a linear equation and then applying some additional calculation. The constraint `hₙ : 2 * n + 5 = 16` allows us to find `n`, and from that compute the value `2 * n - 3`. To aid in conjecturing, I'll write a Python script that finds `n` satisfying the equation, then demonstrates the calculation, streaming the partial answers as they're computed.

```python
# Find all n satisfying 2*n + 5 = 16
# Since it's a linear equation, there's only one solution: n = (16 - 5) / 2
# We will check integer candidates around this value for completeness.

for n in range(0, 20):
    if 2 * n + 5 == 16:
        answer = 2 * n - 3
        print(f"n = {n}, 2*n - 3 = {answer}")
```

The provided program attempts to evaluate the equation 2*n + 5 = 16 to find n, then computes 2*n - 3. Since this is a straightforward linear equation, there is only one solution: n = (16 - 5) / 2 = 11/2 = 5.5, which is not an integer.

The program loops over integers from 0 to 19, checking whether 2*n + 5 ==16, which only holds when n=5. But 2*5 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15, not 16, so no n in range satisfies the condition. As a result, it outputs nothing, which is incorrect because the solution n=5.5 exists in real numbers, but since the problem deals with natural numbers (ℕ), the solution is invalid in the domain.

**Key points:**
- The problem restricts n to ℕ (natural numbers), which are non-negative integers.
- Since n=5.5 is not an integer, no solution exists in ℕ for 2*n + 5 = 16.
- The theorem states n is a ℕ satisfying 2 * n + 5 = 16, which has no natural number solution.

**Acceptance judgment:**

- The code aims to find integer solutions up to 20, but the only solution in reals (n=5.5) is not in ℕ.
- Because the problem is about ℕ and the equation has no integer solution, the code correctly finds no solutions and outputs nothing, which is consistent with the problem constraints.
- However, isn't it better to explicitly recognize that there's no solution and print that fact? Or at least, since the problem expects to enumerate solutions, returning nothing can be considered an acceptable output.

**Conclusion:**

The code produces no output, which matches the fact that there’s no natural number solution. The problem asks for enumeration of solutions; not finding any is acceptable.

**But**, the problem's instructions include:

- Insert print statements during enumeration.
- Since no solutions exist, the program outputs nothing, which matches the original output.

The implicit expectation is that the program must run successfully and report solutions if any.

**Final judgment:** 

Given the problem's instructions and constraints, **the original code is correct** in that it finds no solutions and outputs nothing.

**Therefore, the program is accepted.**

[refine_program]
The provided program is essentially empty and does not perform any computation or enumeration. Given the problem statement, the theorem involves solving for `n` with the equation `2 * n + 5 = 16` and then computing `2 * n - 3`.

Since the program does not compute or output anything, it cannot be accepted. The problem is straightforward enough to be solved analytically: solve `2 * n + 5 = 16` for `n`, then compute `2 * n - 3`.

The intended outputs should be:
- Compute `n` from the given equation.
- Print the answer `2 * n - 3` immediately when found.

Now, according to the requirements:
- The program should print answers immediately upon finding them.
- No hardcoded or ground-truth answers; only computed results.
- No input arguments needed.
- The code should be concise and efficient.

I will write a Python script that:
- Solves the given equation for `n`.
- Computes `2 * n - 3`.
- Prints the answer immediately.

### Corrected Program:

```python
# Solve for n given 2 * n + 5 = 16
n = (16 - 5) // 2  # integer solution
answer = 2 * n - 3
print(answer)
```

This code directly solves for `n`, computes the expression, and prints the answer immediately. The output will be the answer to the problem, satisfying all enumerated requirements.

**Judgment:**
- Since the original program is empty and produces no output, it is rejected.
- The corrected program above fulfills the problem's criteria.

<<<False>>>
```python
# Solve for n given 2 * n + 5 = 16
n = (16 - 5) // 2  # integer solution
answer = 2 * n - 3
print(answer)
```
