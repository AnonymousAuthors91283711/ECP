The problem appears to be about counting the number of functions \( t : \mathrm{Fin}\ 2014 \to \mathbb{N} \) that satisfy certain properties related to an auxiliary function \( f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \). The functions \(f\) satisfy:

- \( f(1) = 1 \),
- Monotonic: \( a \leq b \Rightarrow f(a) \leq f(b) \),
- Doubling property: \( f(2a) = f(a) + 1 \).

The goal is to determine the size of the set of such functions \( t \), which are restrictions of \(f\) to initial segments indexed by \(i.1\) of elements in \(\mathrm{Fin}\ 2014\).

I will analyse the problem by simulating possible functions \(f\) that meet these constraints, identify their behaviors, and count the total number of such functions restricted to the domain \(\{0, 1, ..., 2013\}\). The key is understanding the structure introduced by the doubling property and the monotonicity.

Here's the reasoning:
- \(f(1) = 1\)
- For \(a\ge1\), the doubling property relates \(f(2a)\) to \(f(a)\): \(f(2a) = f(a) + 1\).
- Monotonicity constrains how \(f\) behaves when increasing arguments.

By analyzing these, I observe \(f\) is determined by its values on powers of 2 and the monotonic increments. The pattern resembles counting functions where at each doubling step, the function increases by 1, and between these points, the function can increase gradually.

Our task is to enumerate all functions \(f\) satisfying these constraints, then restrict to the initial segment \(\{0, ..., 2013\}\), and count how many such \(t\) arise.

The Python code below executes this reasoning:

- Enumerates possible values of \(f\) at each relevant point (powers of 2),
- Extends \(f\) monotonically between these points,
- Counts all consistent functions within the range,
- Restricts to the first 2014 points.

This will yield the number of such functions (set cardinality).

```python
import itertools

# The key is to count how many functions f : N -> N satisfy:
# f(1)=1, f is non-decreasing, and f(2a)=f(a)+1.
# These properties imply that f can be reconstructed from its values at powers of 2,
# and between these points, f can increase arbitrarily (up to the monotonicity constraints).

# Generate all possible values at powers of 2 up to a certain limit, given the constraints.
# For 0 to 2013, find all possible f(n) consistent with the properties.

# Since f(1)=1, and for a power of 2, f(2^k) = f(2^{k-1}) + 1, so f(2^k) = 1 + k.
# For numbers between powers of 2, f can vary monotonically with potential increases.

# Approach:
# 1. For each level k, f(2^k) = 1 + k.
# 2. For numbers between 2^{k-1} and 2^{k}, f can take values between f(2^{k-1}) and f(2^k), non-decreasing.
# 3. For each interval, count the non-decreasing sequences from f(2^{k-1}) to f(2^k).

# Implementation:
def count_functions(limit=2014):
    # Determine maximum power of 2 within limit
    max_pow = 0
    while 2 ** max_pow < limit:
        max_pow += 1
    # For each interval between powers of two, count sequences
    total = 1
    prev_val = 1  # f(1) = 1
    for k in range(1, max_pow + 1):
        start = 2 ** (k - 1)
        end = min(2 ** k, limit)
        length = end - start
        # f at start = prev_val
        # f at end = 1 + k
        # For each position, f can increase monotonically
        # Number of non-decreasing sequences from prev_val to 1 + k over 'length' steps
        if length == 0:
            continue
        # Count non-decreasing sequences:
        # Number of solutions to: f_i >= prev_val, f_{i+1} >= f_i, and f_{length} <= 1 + k
        # This is count of weakly increasing sequences from prev_val to 1 + k over 'length' steps
        # The number of such sequences:
        # Comb with repetition: C((1 + k) - prev_val + length - 1, length)
        # because each step increase can be at most (1 + k) - prev_val
        min_increase = prev_val
        max_increase = 1 + k
        # The total number of sequences:
        # Number of compositions with sum = total increase over steps:
        total_increase = max_increase - min_increase
        # Distribute total_increase across length steps:
        ways = itertools.combinations_with_replacement(range(total_increase + 1), length)
        count = sum(1 for _ in ways)
        total *= count
        prev_val = max_increase
    return total

# However, itertools.combinations_with_replacement generate huge, so we use combinatorial formula:
from math import comb

def count_non_decreasing_sequences(low, high, length):
    # Number of non-decreasing sequences of length 'length' from values in [low, high]
    # Number of solutions to f_i in [low, high], f_{i+1} >= f_i, sum of (f_i - low) over i = total_increase
    total_increase = high - low
    # Number of ways to distribute total_increase over length positions:
    return comb(total_increase + length, length)

def total_functions(limit=2014):
    max_pow = 0
    while 2 ** max_pow < limit:
        max_pow += 1
    total = 1
    prev_val = 1
    for k in range(1, max_pow + 1):
        start = 2 ** (k - 1)
        end = min(2 ** k, limit)
        length = end - start
        if length == 0:
