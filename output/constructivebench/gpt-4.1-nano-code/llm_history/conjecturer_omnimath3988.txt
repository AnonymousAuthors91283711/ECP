Given the functional equation f(f m + n) + f m = f n + f (3 * m) + 2014, the solutions are affine functions based on the pattern observed. Since equations involve shifts and triple arguments, the general form likely includes linear functions with integer constants.

The given problem asks to find all functions \(f : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}\) satisfying the functional equation:

\[f (f m + n) + f m = f n + f (3 m) + 2014.\]

The current proposed answer suggests the family of affine functions \(f(x) = 3x + c\), which is a typical solution structure for linear-type functional equations. This family likely captures all solutions, given the nature of the equation.

The Lean syntax for a set of functions of the form \(\{f : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \mid \exists c : \mathbb{Z}, \forall x : \mathbb{Z}, f x = 3 x + c\}\) can be written as:

```lean
{f : ℤ → ℤ | ∃ c : ℤ, ∀ x : ℤ, f x = 3 * x + c}
```

The main error originates from syntax mistakes. In Lean, the set notation is enclosed with braces `{ | ... }`, and the body is a predicate. Also, the rule for defining initial answer set should be the same as the conjectured answer.

The suggestion is to replace the "sorry" with that set, enclosed correctly, and fix the syntax error that appeared in the original code.

**Final Answer:**
