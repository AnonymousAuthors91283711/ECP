This problem involves finding a unique point \((p_1, p_2)\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) satisfying given conditions, including a quadratic relation, coordinate rotation, and an explicit equation. To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will numerically enumerate candidate points that satisfy the algebraic constraints approximately, prioritizing exact solutions where possible.

The key equations:
- \( p_2 = p_1^2 - 4 \)
- Let \(\theta = \pi/3\)
- Rotation:
  \[
  x' = p_1 \cos \theta - p_2 \sin \theta,\quad y' = p_1 \sin \theta + p_2 \cos \theta
  \]
- The condition:
  \[
  y' = x'^2 - 4
  \]
- Constraints:
  \[
  p_1 > 0,\quad p_2 < 0
  \]

Given that \(\cos \pi/3 = 1/2\), \(\sin \pi/3 = \sqrt{3}/2\), I'll sample \(p_1\) over a range (say, 0 to 4) with small steps, compute \(p_2\), then check whether the rotated point satisfies the quadratic relation within tolerance. We also ensure \(p_2<0\).

```python
import math

# Constants for rotation
cos_theta = 0.5
sin_theta = math.sqrt(3)/2
tolerance = 1e-5

# Enumerator parameters
p1_min, p1_max, p1_step = 0.1, 4, 0.01

for p1 in [p1_min + i * p1_step for i in range(int((p1_max - p1_min)/p1_step) + 1)]:
    p2 = p1**2 - 4
    if p2 >= 0:
        continue  # p2 must be negative
    # Rotate coordinates
    x_prime = p1 * cos_theta - p2 * sin_theta
    y_prime = p1 * sin_theta + p2 * cos_theta
    # Check the quadratic relation: y' ≈ x'^2 - 4
    if abs(y_prime - (x_prime**2 - 4)) < tolerance:
        print(f"Candidate point: p1={p1:.3f}, p2={p2:.3f}")
```

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step:

### Problem Summary:
- Find a unique pair \((p_1, p_2)\) satisfying:
  - \(p_2 = p_1^2 - 4\) with \(p_1 > 0\) and \(p_2 < 0\).
  - When rotated by \(\theta = \pi/3\):
    \[
    y' = x'^2 - 4
    \]
  - With:
    \[
    x' = p_1 \cos \theta - p_2 \sin \theta,\quad y' = p_1 \sin \theta + p_2 \cos \theta
    \]
- The solution must be unique.

### Analysis:
- The code attempts to enumerate \((p_1, p_2)\) with \(p_1\) from 0.1 to 4 in steps of 0.01.
- \(p_2\) is set as \(p_1^2 - 4\).
- Checks if \(p_2 < 0\).
- Computes \(x'\) and \(y'\).
- Checks if \(y' \approx x'^2 - 4\) within a small tolerance.

### Issue in the original code:
- For each \(p_1\), \(p_2\) is uniquely determined as \(p_1^2 - 4\). Since \(p_1 > 0\), the only \(p_2\) satisfying the relation is on this parabola.
- But \(p_2 = p_1^2 - 4\) is negative only if \(p_1^2 - 4 < 0 \Rightarrow p_1 < 2\).
  - For \(p_1 \in (0, 2)\), \(p_2<0\). For \(p_1\geq 2\), \(p_2 \geq 0\), so the code skips those.
- The code only outputs candidates within the \(p_1 \in (0,2)\) range.
- Previously, for such enumerations, if no candidate is found within the specified range, the output is empty, as observed ("Error: Program outputs empty result").

### Likely cause:
- The true solution, given the problem's strict uniqueness
[refine_program]
The problem statement is a formal math theorem in Lean (or similar), involving an existence and uniqueness statement about a point (p.1, p.2) in the plane, satisfying certain conditions involving rotation by π/3 and the relationship y' = x'^2 - 4.

However, no explicit implementation or computational code is provided—only placeholders and a 'None' program with no enumeration.

Given the constraints:
- The code has no implementation.
- The enumerated answers are just an error message, indicating nothing is computed.
- The problem wants a code that enumerates possible solutions, but none are given.

Therefore, the original program (essentially empty) cannot be accepted. The problem presumably wants to find the unique point p that satisfies the conditions, probably in a particular geometric context.

Given the problem involves the point p satisfying conditions involving rotation and the parabola y' = x'^2 - 4, it suggests that the solution involves geometric reasoning.

**Analysis of the problem:**

- The point p = (x, y), with p.2 = y, p.1 = x.
- After rotation by π/3, the coordinates become:

```
x' = x * cos(π/3) - y * sin(π/3)
y' = x * sin(π/3) + y * cos(π/3)
```

- The condition y' = x'^2 - 4.

- Also: p.1 > 0, p.2 < 0.

Our goal:

- Find the unique point p satisfying these.

Using algebra to eliminate p, considering the rotation:

cos(π/3) = 1/2

sin(π/3) = √3/2

Let’s write:

x' = x*(1/2) - y*(√3/2)

y' = x*(√3/2) + y*(1/2)

Given y' = x'^2 - 4:

x*(√3/2) + y*(1/2) = (x*(1/2) - y*(√3/2))^2 - 4

Equation involves x and y; with p.1 > 0, p.2 < 0, meaning x > 0, y < 0.

To find the point, we can parametrize or numerically approximate.

**Implementation plan:**

- Since the problem is at high
