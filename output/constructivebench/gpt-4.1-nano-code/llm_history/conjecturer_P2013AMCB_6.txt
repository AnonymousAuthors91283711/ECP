The pattern suggests that the sum simplifies to a constant derived from completing the square for x and y. Completing the square yields (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 0, so x=5 and y=-3, and their sum is 5 + (-3) = 2. 

Therefore, the answer is the constant 2.

Current Proposed Answer: The pattern suggests that the sum simplifies to a constant derived from completing the square for x and y. Completing the square yields (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 0, so x=5 and y=-3, and their sum is 5 + (-3) = 2.

. Enumerated Answers: Answer: 5 + (-3) = 2. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The current proposed answer is just the number 2, which is appropriate as a closed-form solution. The errors arise because the answer is embedded in a non-lean comment-style string and not properly defined as an expression. To fix this, I will directly define the constant as 2, enclosed in the proper lean syntax. This matches the pattern observed in the enumerated answers—a straightforward numerical value. Since the problem asks for a closed-form constant answer derived from completing the square, the answer is simply 2. The answer should be an ℝ constant, so I will declare it as such.
