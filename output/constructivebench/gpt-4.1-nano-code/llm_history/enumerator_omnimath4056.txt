This problem involves four real numbers \(a, b, c, d\) with specific symmetric constraints, and we are asked to determine the minimum and maximum possible values of their product \(a b c d\). To explore the possible extremal values, I will systematically consider small sample values satisfying the constraints, focusing on symmetry and boundary cases, and then check the product.

```python
# Enumerate candidate quadruples (a, b, c, d) satisfying the constraints
# Constraints:
# 1) a + b + c + d = 2
# 2) a*b + b*c + c*d + d*a + a*c + b*d = 0

# We will consider some symmetric cases and boundary configurations

solutions = []

# Helper function to check the second constraint for quadruple
def check_constraints(a, b, c, d):
    sum1 = a + b + c + d
    sum2 = a*b + b*c + c*d + d*a + a*c + b*d
    return abs(sum1 - 2) < 1e-9 and abs(sum2) < 1e-9

# Test symmetric cases where some variables are equal
for a in [-2, 0, 2]:
    for b in [-2, 0, 2]:
        for c in [-2, 0, 2]:
            d = 2 - (a + b + c)  # satisfy sum constraint
            if check_constraints(a, b, c, d):
                p = a*b*c*d
                print(f"Found quadruple: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, product={p}")
                solutions.append(p)

# Test pairs where two variables are equal, others possibly zero
for a in [-2, 0, 2]:
    for b in [-2, 0, 2]:
        c, d = (a, 2 - a - b)  # set c = a, d to satisfy sum
        if check_constraints(a, b, c, d):
            p = a*b*c*d
            print(f"Found quadruple: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, product={p}")
            solutions.append(p)

# Extreme cases: when two variables are at bounds
test_values = [-2, 0, 2]
for a in test_values:
    for b in test_values:
        c = 0
        d = 2 - (a + b)
        if check_constraints(a, b, c, d):
            p = a*b*c*d
            print(f"Found quadruple: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, product={p}")
            solutions.append(p)

# Output min and max solutions found
if solutions:
    min_p = min(solutions)
    max_p = max(solutions)
    print(f"Minimum product: {min_p}")
    print(f"Maximum product: {max_p}")
else:
    print("No solutions found with the sampled sets.")
```
