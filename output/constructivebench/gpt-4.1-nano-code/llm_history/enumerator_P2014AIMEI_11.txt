The problem involves counting certain paths and then checking whether their probability simplifies to a fraction with coprime numerator and denominator. The goal is to compute the valid paths, total paths, and then find the simplified fraction, as well as the sum of numerator and denominator.

I will:
- Calculate totalPaths as `4^6`.
- Calculate validPaths according to the given expression involving binomial coefficients.
- Compute the fraction (validPaths / totalPaths).
- Simplify the fraction to find coprime numerator and denominator.
- Print all possible rational values matching the fraction as a float, but prioritize exact fractions.

Here's a Python program to iterate through possible small numerator/denominator pairs to find the simplified form, then print the numerator, denominator, their sum, and the fraction.

```python
from math import comb, gcd

# Compute totalPaths
total_paths = 4 ** 6

# Compute validPaths
valid_paths = (
    2 * comb(6, 3) * comb(3, 1) +
    2 * comb(6, 1) * comb(5, 2) +
    2 * comb(6, 0) * comb(6, 3)
)

# Calculate the fraction and reduce
numerator = valid_paths
denominator = total_paths
gcd_nd = gcd(numerator, denominator)
simplified_num = numerator // gcd_nd
simplified_den = denominator // gcd_nd
sum_nd = simplified_num + simplified_den

# Print the simplified fraction and sum
print(simplified_num, simplified_den, sum_nd)
```

This code computes the exact simplified fraction and its sum, matching the problem requirements for enumeration and immediate output.
