The problem appears to ask about functions from integers to booleans, with specific properties related to periodicity and certain truth values. Based on the hypotheses:

- \( P f \) iff \( f \) is periodic with period 22: \( \forall x, f(x) = f(x+22) \).
- \( f \) does not contain two 'true' values within 2 units: there is no \( y \) such that \( f(y) = true \) and \( f(y+2) = true \).

The task is to find the cardinality of such functions, i.e., how many functions satisfy these properties.

---

**Key insights:**
- Because \( f \) is periodic with period 22, the behavior of \( f \) is determined by its values over a single period: any integer \( x \) behaves like \( x \mod 22 \).
- The second property prevents two 'true' values from being within 2 of each other: in the one period, 'true' values cannot be adjacent or separated by only one position.

**Approach:**
- Enumerate all 22-length Boolean patterns (bitstrings).
- Count how many have no two 'true' bits within distance 2.
- Since no external parameters are involved, the enumeration is straightforward.

---

```python
# Enumerate all boolean patterns of length 22
# Count those where no two 'true' bits are within distance 2
N = 22  # length of the period
answers = []

# Generate all possible bit patterns for one period
for mask in range(1 << N):
    pattern = [(mask >> i) & 1 for i in range(N)]
    # Check for 'true' bits within distance 2
    valid = True
    for i in range(N):
        if pattern[i] == 1:
            # Check next bit
            if pattern[(i + 1) % N] == 1:
                valid = False
                break
            # Check next to next bit
            if pattern[(i + 2) % N] == 1:
                valid = False
                break
    if valid:
        answers.append(pattern)

# The total number of such functions equals the count of these patterns
print("Number of functions satisfying the conditions:", len(answers))
# For illustration, print first few patterns
for i, pattern in enumerate(answers[:5], 1):
    print(f"Pattern {i}: {pattern}")

```
