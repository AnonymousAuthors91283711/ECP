abbrev P2003AMCB_2_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2003AMCB_2 (g p : ℝ) :
  g = p + 1 ∧ 14 * (g + p) = 546 ↔ g = P2003AMCB_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 20. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The conditions simplify to g = p + 1 and 14 * (2p + 1) = 546, giving p = 19. Then g = 20.  
Final answer: <<<20>>>
