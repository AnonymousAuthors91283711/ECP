The pattern suggests the product of transformed digits reduces to 1 if digit is 0 or 5; otherwise, it remains the same. Since each digit 0 or 5 resets the product to 1 modulo 1000, and for all other digits the product behavior cyclically impacts the cumulative result, the overall product modulo 1000 stabilizes toward 1 as numbers grow large. 

Hence, the limit for large n appears to stabilize at 1.

The key insight from the enumerated data is that the transformed digit is simply `d` unless `d` equals 0 or 5, in which case it becomes 1. The product over all digits is modularly affected by this transformation, and the overall cumulative product mod 1000 seems to stabilize periodically due to the repeated digit patterns and cyclicities.

To formalize this, we note that:
- Digits 0 and 5 are transformed to 1.
- Other digits are unchanged.
- The overall product modulo 1000 is largely influenced by the presence of these special digits.

Given the repeated pattern of digit transformations and that the initial small values produce products that tend to stabilize or cycle within a finite set modulo 1000, and since the problem involves product over a broad range (1 to 2019), the limit and behavior seem to tend toward a fixed value — particularly 1, considering the pattern stabilization at larger `n`. 

In Lean, since the problem asks for a closed-form expression for the product mod 1000 and from the patterns, the frequent presence of edge digits 0 and 5 contributing factors of 1, and the stabilization observed, we conjecture that the overall product modulo 1000 simplifies to 1 after the adjustment. 

Thus, the answer can be expressed as a fixed value, indicating the stable pattern:

The enumerated data shows that the pattern of transformed digits stabilizes into a repeating cycle where the product modulo 1000 oscillates among certain residues, but notably, many of these resulting cumulative products tend to stabilize or reduce to 1 over larger `n` due to factors and cancellations, especially given the transformation rules (0 and 5 mapped to 1). 

From the pattern, at specific points, the product resets or is stabilized (e.g., at `n=1`, the product is 1; at `n=5`, it reverts to 24; at larger `n`, the cumulative product tends to reset or stabilize around `1` after multiple transformations). Given the uniform effect of the digit transformation and the observed stabilization, the conjecture is that the overall product mod 1000 for sufficiently large `n` (like 2019) will be 1.

Hence, a safe closed-form answer, generalizing from the pattern's stabilization and the nature of transformations, is:
