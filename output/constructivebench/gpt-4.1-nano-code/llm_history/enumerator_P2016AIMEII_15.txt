The problem involves identifying the maximal value of a particular quadratic form over positive sequences summing to 1, with specific constraints involving the sequence \( x_i \) and the constants \( a_i \). The sequence \( a_i \) is decreasing, approaching 0, with its values defined explicitly. To analyze the extremal value, we can consider candidate distributions \( x_i \) that are simple and symmetric, such as the case when \( x_i \) is concentrated equally among a subset or follows a specific pattern. For this problem, without the detailed derivation, heuristics suggest that the maximum might occur with a certain structure, typically involving the sequence \( a_i \).

As we only need to enumerate potential answers with code, a practical approach is:

- Select small sample values for \( x_i \), focusing on the largest \( a_i \).
- Compute the expression given the constraints.
- Vary the distribution among the first few indices to seek the maximum.

Our code will do this through a brute-force enumeration limited to small subsets, checking positive values summing to 1, and computing the specified sums. This approach maximizes efficiency by limiting the search space to manageable candidate distributions.

```python
import math
from itertools import combinations, permutations

# Sequence a_i for i=0 to 215 (since Fin 216 means 0-based indexing)
a = [1 / (2 ** (i + 1)) if i < 215 else 1 / (2 ** 215) for i in range(216)]
# For simplicity, focus on the first few indices since a_i decreases rapidly
indices = list(range(10))  # subset of indices to consider

# Enumerate distributions where x_i are positive and sum to 1, with small support
max_value = -math.inf
best_x = None

# For computational feasibility, test uniform distributions and those concentrated on first index
# Generate candidate distributions
candidate_distributions = []

# 1. Uniform over first n indices
for n in range(1, 6):  # small support size
    x = [0.0] * 216
    for i in range(n):
        x[i] = 1.0 / n
    candidate_distributions.append(x)

# 2. Concentration on first index
x_full = [0.0] * 216
x_full[0] = 1.0
candidate_distributions.append(x_full)

# 3. Concentrate on first two indices
x_two = [0.0] * 216
x_two[0], x_two[1] = 0.7, 0.3  # arbitrary positive split
candidate_distributions.append(x_two)

# Enumerate and evaluate
for x in candidate_distributions:
    # compute sums
    sum_x = sum(x)
    if abs(sum_x - 1.0) > 1e-8:
        continue  # ensure sum to 1
    sum_x2 = sum(x_i * x_i for x_i in x)
    # Compute the complicated sum: ∑_{i} ∑_{j > i} x_i * x_j
    sum_cross = 0.0
    for i in range(216):
        for j in range(i+1, 216):
            sum_cross += x[i] * x[j]
    # Compute the expression as per the problem
    total = (107/215) + sum(
        a[i] * x[i] * x[i] / (2 * (1 - a[i])) for i in range(216)
    ) + sum_x2 + 2 * sum_cross  # since ∑_{i<j} x_i x_j sum is sum_cross, total sum of quadratic form
    # Keep track of maximum
    if total > max_value:
        max_value = total
        best_x = x

# Output the maximum found
print("Maximum approximate value:", max_value)
# Optionally, print the distribution achieving that maximum
print("Distribution example:", best_x[:10])  # print first few values
```
