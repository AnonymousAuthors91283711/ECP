The problem involves two prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \), and the existence of integers \( a, b \) such that:
\[
p + q = a^2,\quad p + 7q = b^2
\]
Given that \( p \) and \( q \) are prime, we want to analyze the possibilities.

Subtract the first from the second:
\[
(p + 7q) - (p + q) = b^2 - a^2 \Rightarrow 6q = (b - a)(b + a)
\]
Since \( q \) is prime, \( 6q \) factors into factors of the form \( (b - a)(b + a) \), with \( b - a \) and \( b + a \) positive integers, and their product equals \( 6q \).

Because \( q \) is prime, the divisors of \( 6q \) are limited: \( 1, 2, 3, q, 6, 2q, 3q, 6q \), and possibly their negatives. Since \( b - a \) and \( b + a \) are integer factors of \( 6q \), and \( b + a \geq b - a \), potential pairs are constrained.

Here's a Python script that:
- Samples small primes \( p \) and \( q \),
- Checks for integer solutions \( a, b \),
- Reports possible solutions,
- Infers the prime \( p \) in the equivalence.

This includes:
- Fixing small prime \( q \),
- Enumerating \( p \),
- Checking if \( p \) is prime,
- Computing \( a^2 = p + q \),
- Computing \( b^2 = p + 7q \),
- Validating that \( a \) and \( b \) are integers (perfect squares),
- Outputting each valid solution.

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Sample small primes for q
prime_qs = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]

# We'll attempt small p and q
for q in prime_qs:
    for p in range(2, 50):
        if not is_prime(p):
            continue
        sum1 = p + q
        sum2 = p + 7*q
        a = int(math.isqrt(sum1))
        b = int(math.isqrt(sum2))
        if a * a == sum1 and b * b == sum2:
            print(f"p={p}, q={q}, a={a}, b={b}")
```
