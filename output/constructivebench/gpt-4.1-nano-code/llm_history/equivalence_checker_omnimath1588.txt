Ground Truth Answer: (sqrt 2 - 1) * (sqrt 3 + sqrt 2)
Proposed Answer: (180 / π) * (cos (π * 30.5 / 180) - cos (π * (30.5 + 15) / 180)) / (sin (π * 30.5 / 180) - sin (π * (30.5 + 15) / 180))
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves evaluating the ratio of two trigonometric sums, each with 15 terms of cosine and sine functions with angles incrementing by 1 degree (π/180 radians) starting from 30.5 degrees.

2. The ground truth answer gives a simplified exact form involving square roots: (√2 - 1)(√3 + √2).

3. The proposed answer attempts to use trigonometric identities to simplify the sums, converting them into difference terms using trigonometric sum identities.

Key observations:
- The proposed answer's approach of converting sums to differences is conceptually correct for this type of problem.
- However, the exact form (√2 - 1)(√3 + √2) is much simpler and more elegant than the proposed expression.
- The proposed answer includes an unnecessary factor of (180/π) which shouldn't be present in the final ratio.
- The ground truth answer is clearly simplified and matches known exact values for these trigonometric expressions.

Conclusion: While the proposed answer is on the right track conceptually, it's not equivalent to the ground truth answer due to the incorrect factor and lack of simplification.
