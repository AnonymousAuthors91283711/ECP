This problem involves finding positive integers a and b satisfying several modular and linear relations, including proportional equations that involve division. To approach this efficiently, I will generate candidate values for a and b within reasonable bounds, check the conditions, and identify possible solutions. Since the problem looks like a system of linear equations with divisibility constraints, I will:

- Loop through small positive values of a and b.
- Check the divisibility conditions: 2*a divisible by 3, 5*b divisible by 8.
- Verify the fractional equations by computing the divisions and comparing with the relations.
- Print each solution immediately when found.

I will limit the search to small bounds (e.g., a, b < 100) for efficiency and because the problem seems to be intended for small integers.

```python
# Enumerate small positive integers a, b to find solutions satisfying the constraints
for a in range(1, 100):
    if (2 * a) % 3 != 0:
        continue
    for b in range(1, 100):
        if (5 * b) % 8 != 0:
            continue
        # Check the equations:
        # (5 * b) / 8 = (2 * a) / 3 + 7
        lhs1 = (5 * b) / 8
        rhs1 = (2 * a) / 3 + 7
        if abs(lhs1 - rhs1) > 1e-6:
            continue
        # (3 * b) / 8 = (a) / 3 + 7
        lhs2 = (3 * b) / 8
        rhs2 = (a) / 3 + 7
        if abs(lhs2 - rhs2) > 1e-6:
            continue
        # If all conditions are met, print the solution
        print(f"Solution: a={a}, b={b}")
```
