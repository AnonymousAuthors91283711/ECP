The problem involves a combinatorial configuration within a Cartesian product set. To approximate the maximal size \(k\) of the subset \(T\), which avoids a certain pattern, we can attempt a brute-force enumeration over small parameters, especially given the bounds. We'll consider \(T\) as a subset of the product over small ranges (e.g., between 1 and 10) to make enumeration feasible within token constraints.

Key points:
- The set is a subset of \(\{1, 2, ..., 1993\} \times \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\), but for manageability, consider a smaller sample (e.g., 1..10).
- We need to find the largest possible \(T\) with no quadruple \(\{a,b,c,d\}\) satisfying the specific pattern involving equalities of coordinates and distances.
- For simplicity, we approximate by generating candidate subsets and checking for forbidden patterns.

Our implementation:
- Generate the sample set.
- Use a greedy approach to construct \(T\), starting from an empty set and adding points unless they create a forbidden pattern.
- Record the maximum size found.

```python
import itertools

# Sample parameters for manageable enumeration
max_x, max_y = 10, 4
points = list(itertools.product(range(1, max_x + 1), range(1, max_y + 1)))

def dist(p1, p2):
    return (p1[0] - p2[0])**2 + (p1[1] - p2[1])**2

def has_forbidden_quad(T):
    for quad in itertools.combinations(T, 4):
        a, b, c, d = quad
        coords = [a, b, c, d]
        # Check the pattern conditions
        # Conditions: {a,b,c,d} subset, specific equalities, and distance equalities
        # (rest of check simplified for code)
        for permutation in itertools.permutations(coords):
            a, b, c, d = permutation
            if (a[0] == b[0] and a[1] == c[1] and b[1] == d[1] and c[0] == d[0]):
                if (dist(a,b) == dist(a,c) == dist(b,d) == dist(c,d)):
                    return True
    return False

T = []
max_size = 0
# Greedy construction
for p in points:
    temp_T = T + [p]
    if not has_forbidden_quad(temp_T):
        T = temp_T
        if len(T) > max_size:
            max_size = len(T)

print(f"Approximate maximum size k: {max_size}")
```
