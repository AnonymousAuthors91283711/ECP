The problem appears to involve algebraic manipulation related to two positive real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), with definitions \( a = 1 + \frac{x}{y} \) and \( b = 1 + \frac{y}{x} \). The goal is to find the value of \( a^3 + b^3 \) given that \( a^2 + b^2 = 15 \).

Given the symmetry, consider the relationship between \( a \) and \( b \). Noting \( a = 1 + \frac{x}{y} \), \( b = 1 + \frac{y}{x} \).

Observe that:
\[
a - 1 = \frac{x}{y}, \quad b - 1 = \frac{y}{x}
\]

Multiplying:
\[
(a - 1)(b - 1) = \frac{x}{y} \times \frac{y}{x} = 1
\]

So:
\[
(ab - a - b + 1) = 1
\]
\[
ab - a - b + 1 = 1
\]
\[
ab - a - b = 0
\]
\[
ab = a + b
\]

Now, expressing \( a^2 + b^2 = 15 \):

Recall:
\[
a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab
\]
\[
15 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab
\]

Using \( ab = a + b \), rewrite:
\[
15 = (a + b)^2 - 2(a + b)
\]

Let \( s = a + b \). Then:
\[
15 = s^2 - 2s
\]
\[
s^2 - 2s - 15 = 0
\]

Solve quadratic:
\[
s = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 60}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{64}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm 8}{2}
\]
\[
s = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad s = -3
\]

Since \( a \) and \( b \) are built from positive \( x, y \), \( a, b > 1 \), meaning \( a + b > 2 \), so the negative sum \( s = -3 \) is invalid. Hence, \( s = 5 \).

Recall \( ab = s = 5 \).

Now, find \( a^3 + b^3 \):

\[
a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b) = s^3 - 3 \times 5 \times s
\]

Plug in \( s=5 \):

\[
a^3 + b^3 = 5^3 - 3 \times 5 \times 5 = 125 - 75 = 50
\]

Therefore, the value is 50.
