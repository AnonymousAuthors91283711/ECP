Ground Truth Answer: 2/3

noncomputable def a : ℕ → ℝ
| 0 => 1/2
| n + 1 => 1 + (a n - 1)^2
Proposed Answer: (π / 2)⁻¹
Let me analyze this carefully.

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence `a` where:
   - a₀ = 1/2
   - aₙ₊₁ = 1 + (aₙ - 1)²

2. The theorem states that the infinite product of these terms converges to some value (omnimath2494_answer).

3. The ground truth claims this limit is 2/3.

4. The proposed answer suggests it's (π/2)⁻¹ ≈ 0.6366, while 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

These are clearly different values (0.6366 ≠ 0.6667). The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth.
