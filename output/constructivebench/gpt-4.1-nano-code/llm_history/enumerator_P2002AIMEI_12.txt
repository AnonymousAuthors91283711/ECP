The problem describes a recursive sequence \( z_{n+1} = F(z_n) \) with \( F(z) = \frac{z + i}{z - i} \), starting from \( z_0 = \frac{1}{137} + i \), and asks for the real and imaginary parts of \( z_{2002} \) in some relation. The function \( F \) is a Möbius transformation, and the recursive process resembles a Möbius iteration that typically simplifies through understanding fixed points or iterations on the Riemann sphere. 

Given the complex form, this transformation is known to induce rotations or shifts on the complex plane, which may stabilize or produce a periodic cycle. An efficient way to analyze such a recursive sequence is to identify if it converges or cycles. Analyzing the sequence directly for \( 2002 \) steps with arbitrary precision is computationally feasible.

Thus, the approach:
- We define \( F(z) \),
- Starting from the initial \( z_0 \),
- Compute \( z_{n+1} = F(z_n) \) iteratively up to \( 2002 \),
- Record the real part \( a \) and the imaginary part \( b \),
- Output the sum \( a + b \).

Since the explicit symbolic method is complex, a numerical simulation with floating-point iteration suffices here. We will perform this simulation efficiently, then output the sum \( a + b \).

```python
# Python program to simulate the recursion for z_{n+1} = (z + i)/(z - i)
# starting from z_0 = (1/137) + i, iterating 2002 times,
# then outputting the sum of real and imaginary parts.

z = complex(1/137, 1)
for _ in range(2002):
    z = (z + 1j) / (z - 1j)

a = z.real
b = z.imag
print(a + b)
```
