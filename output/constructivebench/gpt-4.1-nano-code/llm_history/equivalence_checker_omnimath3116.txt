Ground Truth Answer: 11
Proposed Answer: 9
Let me analyze the problem and the answers.

The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n that satisfies the given conditions involving r, y, b with constraints r ≤ 10, y ≤ 7, b ≤ 3, and equal differences (10 - r) = (7 - y) = (3 - b), where n is the sum of these three equal differences.

Key observations:
1. Let d = (10 - r) = (7 - y) = (3 - b)
2. Then n = 3d
3. From the constraints:
   - r = 10 - d ≥ 0 ⇒ d ≤ 10
   - y = 7 - d ≥ 0 ⇒ d ≤ 7
   - b = 3 - d ≥ 0 ⇒ d ≤ 3
4. So maximum possible d is 3 ⇒ maximum n = 9

However, the ground truth answer is 11, which would require d = 11/3 ≈ 3.666, but d must be integer because r, y, b are natural numbers. The maximum integer d is indeed 3, making n = 9.

The proposed answer 9 is correct, while the ground truth answer 11 appears incorrect as it violates the integer constraint.
