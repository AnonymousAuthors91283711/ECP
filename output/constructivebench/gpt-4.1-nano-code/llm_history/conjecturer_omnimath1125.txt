. Enumerated answers: a(15) % 10 = 6. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sequence is given by a(n) = 2^(a(n-1)) with a(0)=1, leading to a rapidly growing exponential sequence. Since a(15) is huge, and we only need its last digit, focus on modulo 10 pattern. Powers of 2 mod 10 cycle every 4: 2, 4, 8, 6. In particular, since a(n) = 2^{a(n-1)}, the last digit depends on the last digit of a(n-1). Tracing this pattern backward reveals that the sequence's last digit stabilizes at 6 beyond certain powers. Therefore, a(15) mod 10 = 6.
