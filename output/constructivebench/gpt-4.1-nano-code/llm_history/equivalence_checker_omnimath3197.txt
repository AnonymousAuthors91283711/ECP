abbrev omnimath3197_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3197 (x : ℕ) (hx : 0 < x) (h : 100 % x = 10) : 
  1000 % x = omnimath3197_answer x := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => if 100 % x = 10 then 1000 % x else 0
Proposed Answer: fun x => if (x = 15) ∨ (x = 30) ∨ (x = 45) ∨ (x = 90) then x else 15
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
- We need to find a function that returns 1000 % x when 100 % x = 10, and 0 otherwise
- The condition 100 % x = 10 implies x must be a divisor of (100 - 10) = 90, but not a divisor of 100
- The possible x values satisfying 100 % x = 10 are indeed 15, 30, 45, 90

Ground Truth Answer:
- Correctly implements the specification
- Returns 1000 % x when condition is met, 0 otherwise

Proposed Answer:
- Correctly identifies the x values that satisfy the condition (15,30,45,90)
- However, it returns x instead of 1000 % x for these cases
- Returns 15 as default instead of 0

Comparison:
- The proposed answer gets the condition right but the return values wrong
- For x=15: 1000%15=10 but answer returns 15
- For x=30: 1000%30=10 but answer returns 30
- For other x: should return 0 but returns 15
