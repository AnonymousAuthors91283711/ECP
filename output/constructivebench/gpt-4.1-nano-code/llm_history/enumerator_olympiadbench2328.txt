The problem appears to relate two sequences: a geometric sequence with initial term 10 and ratio (1/2), and an arithmetic sequence starting at 10 with common difference d. The statement asks for the values of d satisfying a particular ratio condition. 

Specifically, the condition simplifies to comparing ratios at certain indices, and the key is to find all d such that
\[ \frac{\text{geometric_seq}(6)}{\text{geometric_seq}(4)} = \frac{\text{arithmetic_seq}(6)}{\text{arithmetic_seq}(4)} \]
holds.

Given the sequences:
- Geometric:
  \[\text{geometric_seq}(n) = 10 \times (1/2)^n \]

- Arithmetic:
  \[\text{arithmetic_seq}(n) = 10 + d \times n \]

We can explicitly compute the geometric ratio:
\[
\frac{\text{geometric_seq}(6)}{\text{geometric_seq}(4)} = \frac{10 \times (1/2)^6}{10 \times (1/2)^4} = \frac{(1/2)^6}{(1/2)^4} = (1/2)^{6-4} = (1/2)^2 = 1/4
\]

The ratio of the arithmetic sequence:
\[
\frac{\text{arithmetic_seq}(6)}{\text{arithmetic_seq}(4)} = \frac{10 + 6d}{10 + 4d}
\]

We seek all d such that:
\[
\frac{10 + 6d}{10 + 4d} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

which yields a linear equation in d:
\[
4(10 + 6d) = 10 + 4d
\]
\[
40 + 24d = 10 + 4d
\]
\[
24d - 4d = 10 - 40
\]
\[
20d = -30
\]
\[
d = -\frac{30}{20} = -\frac{3}{2}
\]

Thus, the set of all such d is \(\{-\frac{3}{2}\}\).

Here's a Python script that confirms this calculation by enumerating possible d values within some small bounds to verify the solution, streaming the results to aid in conjecturing:

```python
# Enumearate d in a small range to verify the solution, focusing on the candidate -1.5
for d in [i/10 for i in range(-40, 41)]:  # from -4 to 4 in steps of 0.1
    geometric_ratio = (1/2)**2  # geometric ratio is fixed at 1/4
    arithmetic_ratio = (10 + 6*d) / (10 + 4*d) if (10 + 4*d) != 0 else None
    if arithmetic_ratio is not None and abs(arithmetic_ratio - geometric_ratio) < 1e-9:
        print(f'd = {d:.2f} satisfies ratio condition: {arithmetic_ratio}')
```
