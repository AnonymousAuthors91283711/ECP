This problem appears to involve finding the smallest natural number \( n \) such that there exists a finite set \( s \subseteq \mathbb{N} \) with \( \text{card}(s) = n \), all elements of \( s \) are positive, and the product over all \( i \in s \) of \( 1 - \frac{1}{i} \) equals \( \frac{51}{2010} \).

Equivalently, the product condition can be simplified:
\[
\prod_{i \in s} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{i} \right) = \prod_{i \in s} \frac{i-1}{i} = \frac{\prod_{i \in s} (i-1)}{\prod_{i \in s} i}
\]

Given that, the key is to find a set \( s \) with the above product equal to \( 51/2010 \).

Since the original is a Lean theorem with `IsLeast`, the task is to find the minimal such \( n \).

**Approach:**

- Generate subsets of small positive integers, starting from small sizes.
- For each subset, compute the product.
- When the product matches \( 51/2010 \), record the size \( n \).
- Continue until the minimal \( n \) is confirmed.

Given potential computational complexity, limit the search to small element sets (say up to 10 elements). The set's elements are all positive integers, and the product equals \( 51/2010 \).

Because the answer is unknown, we will write code to enumerate such sets and print the minimal \( n \).

```python
from itertools import combinations
from fractions import Fraction

target = Fraction(51, 2010)

# Upper bound for set elements to limit search
max_element = 20

# Store minimal size found
min_size = None
# Store answer set (for reference, optional)
answer_set = None

# Enumerate sizes from small to larger
for size in range(1, 11):
    found_in_this_size = False
    # Generate all combinations of size 'size' from 1..max_element
    for s in combinations(range(1, max_element + 1), size):
        # Compute product of (i - 1)/i for each i in s
        prod = Fraction(1, 1)
        for i in s:
            prod *= Fraction(i - 1, i)
        if prod == target:
            print(f"Set: {s} of size {size} yields product {prod}")
            if min_size is None or size < min_size:
                min_size = size
                answer_set = s
            found_in_this_size = True
    if found_in_this_size:
        # We found at least one set for this size, check if minimal
        break

# Output the minimal size answer if found
if min_size is not None:
    print(f"Minimal n: {min_size} with set {answer_set}")
else:
    print("No such set found within search bounds.")
```
