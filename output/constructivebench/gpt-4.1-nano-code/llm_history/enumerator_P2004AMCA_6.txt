This problem involves comparing the differences of large exponential numbers and identifying the greatest integer n < 5 satisfying a specific set of inequalities. To aid in empirical analysis, we'll:
- Compute the relevant numbers with manageable approximations.
- Compare their differences to identify which difference might be the greatest.
- Use enumeration over n in 0..4, check the inequalities for each, and find the maximum n satisfying the conditions.

Since the numbers involve large powers, we'll use logarithmic approximations or exact calculations where feasible, focusing on differences to determine dominance.

```python
import math

# Assign parameters
base = 2004
power1 = 2005
power2 = 2004
power3 = 2003

# Compute the terms
U = 2 * base ** power1
V = base ** power1
W = 2003 * base ** (power2)
X = 2 * base ** (power2)
Y = base ** (power2)
Z = base ** (power3)

# To compare differences like U - V, etc., we can compare their logs to avoid huge numbers
def diff_log(a, b):
    # Return the difference of logs, i.e., log(a) - log(b), to compare their ratios
    return math.log(a) - math.log(b)

# Compute logs
log_U = math.log(U)
log_V = math.log(V)
log_W = math.log(W)
log_X = math.log(X)
log_Y = math.log(Y)
log_Z = math.log(Z)

# Differences:
diff_UV = log_U - log_V  # same as log(U/V)
diff_VW = log_V - log_W
diff_WX = log_W - log_X
diff_XY = log_X - log_Y
diff_YZ = log_Y - log_Z

# Convert logs to actual differences for comparison:
# Differences are U-V, etc., but comparing their magnitudes.
# For an approximate comparison, since all are large, compare logs/sizes:
# For strict inequality checks, compare ratios:

def greater_than(a, b):  # a, b are ratios
    return a > b

# For each n in 0..4, check inequalities:
max_n = -1
for n in range(5):
    # Inequalities depend on differences:
    # For each n, check the two inequalities in the conjunction
    if n == 0:
        cond1 = (diff_UV > diff_VW) and (diff_UV > diff_WX) and (diff_UV > diff_XY) and (diff_UV > diff_YZ)
    elif n == 1:
        cond1 = (diff_VW > diff_UV) and (diff_VW > diff_WX) and (diff_VW > diff_XY) and (diff_VW > diff_YZ)
    elif n == 2:
        cond1 = (diff_WX > diff_UV) and (diff_WX > diff_VW) and (diff_WX > diff_XY) and (diff_WX > diff_YZ)
    elif n == 3:
        cond1 = (diff_XY > diff_UV) and (diff_XY > diff_VW) and (diff_XY > diff_WX) and (diff_XY > diff_YZ)
    else:
        cond1 = (diff_YZ > diff_UV) and (diff_YZ > diff_VW) and (diff_YZ > diff_WX) and (diff_YZ > diff_XY)
    if cond1:
        max_n = n

print("Parameter settings:")
print(f"Base = {base}")
print(f"Power1 = {power1}")
print(f"Power2 = {power2}")
print(f"Power3 = {power3}")

# Output the answer
if max_n != -1:
    print(f"Greatest n < 5 satisfying conditions: {max_n}")
else:
    print("No n < 5 satisfies the conditions.")
