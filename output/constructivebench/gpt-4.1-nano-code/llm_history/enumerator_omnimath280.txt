This appears to be a formalization in Lean involving permutations and some maximization over sets of pairs with specific properties.

**Understanding the problem:**

- We consider the set of pairs `(p.1, p.2)` where both are elements of `Fin n`.
- There exists a set `s` of such pairs with size `k`.
- All pairs in `s` satisfy `p.1 < p.2`.
- For each pair `p` in `s`, the transformed product `π p.1 * π p.2` exceeds the original `p.1 * p.2`.
- We are interested in the maximum `k` such that such a set exists.

**Approach to approximate the answer:**

- Since the problem is complex, for small `n`, we can explicitly try every size `k` from 0 up to the total possible pairs `(n*(n-1))/2` (pairs with `i < j`).
- For each `k`, generate all subsets of size `k` of pairs `(i,j)` with `i<j`.
- Check the conditions:
  - For each pair, verify that after applying some permutation `π`, the product increases (simulate this by considering permutations).
  - For initial exploration, assume `π` is the identity permutation (or random permutations).
- Find the maximum `k` for which at least one such set exists.

**Note:** Since the core problem involves permutations and product inequalities, we focus on small `n` (say, `n=4`) to limit computation.

```python
from itertools import combinations, permutations

def enumerate_max_size(n):
    # Generate all pairs with i<j in Fin n
    pairs = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(i+1, n)]
    max_k = 0
    best_sets = []

    # For small n, check all permutations
    for perm in permutations(range(n)):
        perm_map = {i: perm[i] for i in range(n)}
        # For each possible subset size k
        for k in range(len(pairs), 0, -1):
            # Generate all subsets of size k
            for subset in combinations(pairs, k):
                # Check if for all p in subset:
                # (i<j), p.1 < p.2, and product increases under permutation
                if all(perm_map[p[0]] * perm_map[p[1]] > p[0]*p[1] for p in subset):
                    print(f"Size {k}, permutation {perm_map}, subset {subset}")
                    max_k = k
                    best_sets.append((k, perm_map, subset))
            if max_k >= k:
                # Already found max k for some subset
                break
    print(f"Maximum size of such subset: {max_k}")
    return max_k
