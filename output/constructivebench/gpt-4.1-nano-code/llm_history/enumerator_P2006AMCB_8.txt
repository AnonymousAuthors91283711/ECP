The problem provides two equations involving real numbers `a` and `b`, with parameters, and asks for the sum `a + b`. Since it appears to be a high school competition-level problem, likely related to solving simple linear equations, we can try to find all pairs `(a, b)` satisfying the given conditions. To assist in conjecturing and verifying the answer, I will write a Python program that enumerates candidate pairs `(a, b)` based on plausible rational values that satisfy the equations, and then compute `a + b` for each. The equations are:

1. \( 1 = \frac{1}{4} (2 + a) \)
2. \( 2 = \frac{1}{4} (1 + b) \)

Assuming these are exact (or approximate within some small tolerance), we can directly solve for `a` and `b`:

From the first:
\[ 1 = \frac{1}{4}(2 + a) \Rightarrow 4 = 2 + a \Rightarrow a = 2 \]

From the second:
\[ 2 = \frac{1}{4}(1 + b) \Rightarrow 8 = 1 + b \Rightarrow b = 7 \]

Sum:
\[ a + b = 2 + 7 = 9 \]

Let's implement this logic in Python to verify possible solutions, and also enumerate candidates in case of small perturbations.

```python
# This program computes the values of a and b satisfying the given equations,
# then outputs their sum. It also enumerates nearby rational solutions for conjecture.

# Since the equations are straightforward and linear, solutions are:
a = 4 * 1 - 2  # from 1 = (1/4)*(2 + a)
b = 4 * 2 - 1  # from 2 = (1/4)*(1 + b)
sum_ab = a + b
print("a =", a)
print("b =", b)
print("a + b =", sum_ab)  # Exact solution

# To help in conjecture, enumerate possible nearby rational candidates within a small range
for delta_a in [-1, 0, 1]:
    for delta_b in [-1, 0, 1]:
        candidate_a = a + delta_a
        candidate_b = b + delta_b
        candidate_sum = candidate_a + candidate_b
        print(f"Candidate a: {candidate_a}, b: {candidate_b}, sum: {candidate_sum}")
```
