Ground Truth Answer: Icc (-9/2) (-2) ∪ Ioo ((1 - sqrt 5)/2) ((1 + sqrt 5)/2)
Proposed Answer: (Ioo (-4.5) 1.6) \ { -2, - (9/2) }
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer:

1. The ground truth answer consists of two parts:
   - Icc (-9/2) (-2) - a closed interval from -4.5 to -2
   - Ioo ((1 - sqrt 5)/2) ((1 + sqrt 5)/2) - an open interval approximately from -0.618 to 1.618

2. The proposed answer is:
   - Ioo (-4.5) 1.6 - an open interval from -4.5 to 1.6
   - With points -2 and -4.5 removed (though -4.5 is already excluded by the open interval)

Key differences:
- The ground truth includes the closed interval [-4.5, -2], while the proposed answer has an open interval (-4.5, -2)
- The upper bound in the proposed answer (1.6) is slightly different from (1 + sqrt 5)/2 ≈ 1.618
- The proposed answer incorrectly removes -4.5 which was already excluded by the open interval

The proposed answer is mostly correct but has some inaccuracies in the interval types and bounds.
