. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
The pattern suggests the function is related to the reciprocal or a similar inverse form, consistent across the enumerated solutions, and must satisfy the functional equation for all positive x, y. Given the functional equation resembles a form that simplifies when choosing constant functions, and considering positivity constraints, a candidate is f(x) = 1 / x.
