This appears to be a formal statement involving real sets, finite subsets, and an ordering property related to certain arithmetic progressions. To assist in conjecturing and proving the true answer, I will create a Python enumerator that:

- Samples small `n` values (say n=3, 4, 5) for manageable enumeration.
- Generates sets of real numbers constrained to simple, small rational or integral values.
- Searches for 3-element subsets (arithmetic progressions) within those sets.
- Finds the maximum such element among all such 3-term arithmetic progressions for each `n`.
- Immediately prints each candidate result to help form conjectures.

This approach prioritizes exact small rational/integer values, avoids complex real computations, and adheres to the output requirements.

```python
# Enumerate sets of small real numbers with given size n, searching for the maximum element
# appearing in a 3-term arithmetic progression (AP) within the set.
# To keep it manageable, we limit the values to small integers from 0 to 10.
# The code searches all n-element subsets, checks for 3-term APs, and tracks the maximum element of such APs.

from itertools import combinations

def find_max_end_in_ap(n):
    max_end = -1
    # Generate all possible sets of size n with integers 0..10
    for s in combinations(range(0, 11), n):
        s_set = set(s)
        # Check all pairs for potential APs
        for a in s:
            for d in range(1, 11):  # difference d from 1 to 10
                t = [a, a + d, a + 2 * d]
                # Check if all elements of the AP are in s
                if all(x in s_set for x in t):
                    max_end = max(max_end, max(t))
                    print(f"Set: {sorted(s)}, AP: {t}, Max end: {max(t)}")
    # If no AP found, return None
    if max_end == -1:
        print(f"No 3-term APs found in sets of size {n}")
    return max_end if max_end != -1 else None

# Example runs for small n values
for n in range(3, 6):
    print(f"n = {n}")
    result = find_max_end_in_ap(n)
    print(f"Maximum end in 3-term APs for n={n}: {result}\n")
```
