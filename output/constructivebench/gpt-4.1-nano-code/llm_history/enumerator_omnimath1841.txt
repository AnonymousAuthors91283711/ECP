The problem involves finding natural numbers \( n \) that can be expressed such that there exist positive integers \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} = 1 \) and \( a, b, c \) dividing \( n \). The theorem also mentions conditions about \( n \) being minimal or particular values within certain bounds.

Given the nature of the problem, to assist the conjecture, I will:
- Enumerate small positive integers \( a, b, c \) to find all triplets satisfying \( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} = 1 \).
- For each triplet, compute \(\text{lcm}(a, b, c)\) â€” the least common multiple, which is the minimal \( n \) divisible by all three.
- Collect all such \( n \) and analyze their range, especially those between 1 and 15.
- As per the problem, print each answer immediately when identified, and explicitly determine important bounds like minimum and maximum within the range.

The enumeration is feasible because for the sum of the reciprocals to equal 1, \( a, b, c \) must satisfy \( 1/a + 1/b + 1/c = 1 \), with \( a, b, c \geq 2 \) (since for 1, the sum exceeds 1 unless \( b, c \to \infty \)). We are limited in the search space by small numbers.

```python
# Enumerate all triplets (a, b, c) with small values to find solutions to 1/a + 1/b + 1/c = 1
# and compute their minimal n divisibility conditions.

import math

answers = []
for a in range(2, 20):
    for b in range(a, 20):
        for c in range(b, 20):
            total = 1.0/a + 1.0/b + 1.0/c
            # Check for exact equality with 1, allowing tiny floating errors
            if abs(total - 1.0) < 1e-9:
                n = math.lcm(a, b, c)  # minimal n divisible by a, b, c
                answers.append(n)
                print(f"Found triplet a={a}, b={b}, c={c} with n={n}")

# Identify unique solutions
unique_answers = sorted(set(answers))
print("All minimal n's:", unique_answers)

# Find minimal and maximal within a certain range (say up to 15)
candidates = [n for n in unique_answers if n <= 15]
if candidates:
    min_n = min(candidates)
    max_n = max(candidates)
    print("Minimum n up to 15:", min_n)
    print("Maximum n up to 15:", max_n)
else:
    print("No solutions with n <= 15.")
```
