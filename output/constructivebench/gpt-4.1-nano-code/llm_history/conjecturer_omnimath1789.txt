. Enumerated answers: 76. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the last two digits of \( 1032^{1032} \) are influenced by \( 32^{1032} \) mod 100. Since Euler's theorem indicates \( 32^{20} \equiv 1 \pmod{100} \), and 1032 ≡ 12 mod 20, the last two digits correspond to \( 32^{12} \bmod 100 \). Computing \( 32^{12} \pmod{100} \) yields 76. 

Final answer:
<<<76>>>
