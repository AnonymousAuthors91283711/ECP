Because the pattern in the enumerated hints shows the estimated g coefficient at degree 2014 is repeatedly 0, and the condition involves an alternating sum plus powers of 2, the coefficient likely cancels out. This aligns with the symmetry and the polynomial structure, leading to the conclusion that g.coeff 2014 = 0.
