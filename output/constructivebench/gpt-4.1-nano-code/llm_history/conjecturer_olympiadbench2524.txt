Potential solution at x ≈ 8 (difference ≈ -0.000000)

Full list of candidate solutions:
x ≈ 8. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
Given the numerical analysis and the approximate solution near x = 8, the equation holds when x = 8. The difference approaches zero closely here, implying x = 8 exactly satisfies it. No other candidate, based on the sampled points, appears to satisfy the relation precisely. The pattern indicates the solution set reduces to the singleton {8}.
