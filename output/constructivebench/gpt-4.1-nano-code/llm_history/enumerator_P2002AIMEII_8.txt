This problem involves finding the least positive integer \(k\) such that for every nonzero \(n\), \(\lfloor 2002/n \rfloor \neq k\). In other words, we're looking for the smallest integer that does not occur as \(\lfloor 2002/n \rfloor\) for any positive \(n\).

**Insights:**
- For \(n = 1\), \(\lfloor 2002/1 \rfloor = 2002\).
- As \(n \to \infty\), \(\lfloor 2002/n \rfloor \to 0\). But since \(n \neq 0\), the quotient covers values down to 1, possibly 0.
- To find all possible values of \(\lfloor 2002/n \rfloor\), note that:
  \[
  \lfloor 2002/n \rfloor = k \iff \frac{2002}{k+1} < n \le \frac{2002}{k}
  \]
- For each \(k\), the set of \(n\) satisfying this is an interval \((\frac{2002}{k+1}, \frac{2002}{k}]\).

Now, to find the least positive integer \(k\) that **never** occurs as \(\lfloor 2002/n \rfloor\):
- For each candidate \(k\), check if the interval \((2002/(k+1), 2002/k]\) contains any integer \(n \ge 1\).
- If it contains no integers, then \(k\) is the answer.

Let's implement this logic efficiently with a small enumeration:
```python
# Enumerate candidate k from 1 up to a reasonable maximum
# The maximum here could be around 2002, since n=1 gives 2002 and values decrease from there.
max_k = 2002
found_answer = None

for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
    lower_bound = 2002 / (k + 1)
    upper_bound = 2002 / k
    # Check if there's an integer n in the interval (lower_bound, upper_bound]
    # since n must be integer and positive
    n_start = int(lower_bound) + 1  # smallest integer greater than lower_bound
    n_end = int(upper_bound)        # largest integer less than or equal to upper_bound
    # Check if any integer n in [n_start, n_end] exists and n >= 1
    if n_start <= n_end:
        # Valid n exists, so k occurs
        continue
    else:
        # No integer n makes floor(2002/n) = k, so k is the candidate answer
        found_answer = k
        print(k)  # Stream the candidate answer
        break

# Output the final answer
print("The least positive integer not achieved as floor(2002/n):", found_answer)
```
