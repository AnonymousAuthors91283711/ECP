[write_program]
This problem appears to involve finding all natural numbers \( n \) for which there exist non-invertible matrices \(A, B \in M_n(\mathbb{R})\) satisfying the matrix equation \(A B - B A = B^2 A\), with additional conditions related to non-triviality (possibly non-zero matrices). To explore potential \(n\), we can test small matrix sizes, particularly starting from the smallest dimension (e.g., \( n=1, 2, 3 \)). 

Since the matrices are in a real vector space and can be small, we can attempt enumeration in small dimensions: For each \(n\), generate simple matrices (e.g., diagonal or nilpotent) and check whether they satisfy the relation. Given the computational invariance, starting from \( n=1 \) (scalar case) up to a small upper bound like \( n=3 \) suffices to conjecture the possible sizes.

Keep in mind, the problem's algebraic structure suggests limited solutions at higher dimensions, so focusing on small values helps find potential answers efficiently.

```python

import numpy as np

# For simplicity, we consider matrices with small integer entries
# and check for the key equation: AB - BA = B^2 A.
# We test n=1,2,3; matrices are randomly generated with small entries,
# and we only consider nontrivial (non-zero) matrices.

def matrices_of_size(n):
    # Generate small matrices with entries in [-1, 0, 1], excluding zero matrices
    entries = [-1, 0, 1]
    # Generate all possible matrices
    for entries_list in itertools.product(entries, repeat=n*n):
        mat = np.array(entries_list).reshape((n, n))
        if not np.allclose(mat, 0):
            yield mat

    # Check the relation: AB - BA == B^2 A
    left = np.dot(A, B) - np.dot(B, A)
    right = np.linalg.matrix_power(B, 2).dot(A)
    return np.allclose(left, right)

# We will record sizes n where solutions exist

            # Check non-invertibility - in the problem, matrices are non-invertible,
            # but the theorem mentions "Nontrivial (Invertible A)" which probably means non-zero.
            # For safety, check that A and B are not invertible; i.e., det != 0
            if np.linalg.matrix_rank(A) == n or np.linalg.matrix_rank(B) == n:
                # Skip invertible matrices
                continue
            # Now check the main relation
            if check_relation(A, B):
                print(f"n = {n} possibly = {A}, {B}")
                answer_ns.add(n)
                found = True
                # Break early as we've found at least one example
        if found:
            break

# Output the set of sizes n
