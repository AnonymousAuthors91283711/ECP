The problem appears to involve quadratic polynomials over ℝ, their roots, and the set of coefficients. The key points:
- Degree 2 polynomial p
- Roots are exactly {r, s}
- The set of coefficients (coeff p 2, coeff p 1, coeff p 0) equals {r, s}

Given the symmetry and nature of quadratic roots, the coefficients relate to roots via Vieta's formulas:
- coeff p 2 = 1 (assuming monic polynomial)
- coeff p 1 = - (r + s)
- coeff p 0 = r * s

Given the set of coefficients is {r, s}, these are the three coefficients, but their set as a set is {r, s}.

Since coefficients are real numbers and roots, we can set simple rational examples to generate solutions. We'll enumerate possible roots and check which satisfy the condition.

I will generate pairs (r, s) with small rational values and compute the corresponding coefficients.

```python
# Enumerate small rational roots and find quadratic polynomials of degree 2 
# with roots r, s, such that the set of coefficients equals {r, s}.

# Since the quadratic polynomial is monic with roots r, s:
# p(x) = x^2 + a*x + b with roots r, s
# then:
# a = -(r + s)
# b = r * s
# Coefficients as set: {a, b} should be exactly {r, s}

# We generate small rational r, s and check the condition

for r in [i/2 for i in range(-4, 5)]:       # r in [-2, 2] step 0.5
    for s in [i/2 for i in range(-4, 5)]:   # s in [-2, 2]
        a = -(r + s)
        b = r * s
        coeffs_set = {a, b}
        roots_set = {r, s}
        # Check if {a, b} == {r, s}
        # equivalently, the sets match elements
        if coeffs_set == roots_set:
            print(f"r = {r}, s = {s} -> coeffs: {a} (a), {b} (b) -> roots: {roots_set}")
```
