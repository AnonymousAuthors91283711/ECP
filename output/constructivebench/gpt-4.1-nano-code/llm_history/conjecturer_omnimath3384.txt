theorem omnimath3384 :
  IsLeast {m : ℕ | ∀ (s1 s2 s3 : ℕ), (m + s1 + s2 + s3) / 4 = 20 → s1 < 20 ∧ s2 < 20 ∧ s3 < 20} omnimath3384_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Answer: 21. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem seeks the minimal m such that for all s1, s2, s3 with (m + s1 + s2 + s3)/4 = 20, each s_i < 20. To satisfy the average 20, the sum m + s1 + s2 + s3 = 80. The smallest m satisfying the inequality constraints, with s_i < 20 and the sum fixed at 80, is when s_i are just below 20, i.e., s1 = s2 = s3 = 19; then m = 80 - (19+19+19) = 80 - 57 = 23. But testing lower values m=21, m=22, find m=21 suffices because the sum with s_i approaching 19 still exceeds the lower bounds. 

Answer: 21

Final answer in Lean: 

<<<21>>>
