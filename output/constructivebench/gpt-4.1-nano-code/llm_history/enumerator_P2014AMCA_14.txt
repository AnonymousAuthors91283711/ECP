This problem asks us to find the least natural number c such that there exist natural numbers a and b satisfying the conditions:

- a < b < c
- b - a = c - b (b is equidistant from a and c)
- c * a = b * b (relation between the numbers)

Given these conditions, the key is to analyze the relations:

1. Since b - a = c - b, then c = a + 2(b - a) = 2b - a.
2. The second relation is c * a = b^2.

We want to find the smallest c for which such a, b exist satisfying the above. We can test small values of c, and for each c, see if integers a, b exist satisfying the conditions.

Python code to enumerate small c and find such solutions:

```python
# Find the least c satisfying the conditions
# Conditions:
# 1) c = 2*b - a
# 2) c * a = b^2
# with a < b < c, and c > b > a >= 0

# Set a threshold for c (e.g., up to 1000) to limit computation
limit_c = 1000
least_c = None

for c in range(1, limit_c + 1):
    found = False
    for b in range(1, c):
        a = 2 * b - c  # derived from c = 2b - a
        if a >= 0 and a < b:
            # Check second condition
            if c * a == b * b:
                print(f"c={c}, a={a}, b={b}")
                if least_c is None:
                    least_c = c
                found = True
    if found:
        # Since we want the least c, we can break once we find the first
        break

print(f"Least c satisfying conditions: {least_c}")
```

This code searches systematically for the smallest c, then outputs the corresponding a and b.
