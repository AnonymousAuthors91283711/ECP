[write_program]
This Lean theorem aims to find a function `a` from six-element indices to natural numbers such that the pairwise gcds are in a specific prime set \( S \) (primes up to 26), and that each prime in \( S \) appears as a gcd of some pair. To assist in conjecturing and verifying solutions, I'll write a Python program that enumerates all possible 6-tuples of numbers with small factors (like primes up to 26), checking the specified gcd conditions. The program will:

- Fix prime candidates (primes ≤ 26) for elements of the tuple.
- Generate all possible 6-element lists with elements being products of primes ≤ 26.
- For each tuple, verify the gcd conditions:
  - All pairwise gcds are in \( S \).
  - Every prime in \( S \) occurs as a gcd of some pair.
- Immediately print solutions as they are found.

This will help in spotting patterns or constructing specific examples.

```python
import itertools
import math

# Primes up to 26
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23]

# Generate candidate numbers as products of small primes (including itself)
# for simplicity, limit to products of at most two primes to keep enumeration small
candidate_numbers = set()
for p in primes:
    candidate_numbers.add(p)
for p1 in primes:
    for p2 in primes:
        product = p1 * p2
        if product <= 200 and product >= 2:
            candidate_numbers.add(product)
candidate_numbers = list(candidate_numbers)

# Function to check if all pairwise gcds are in S, and each prime in S appears
def check_tuple(tup, s_set):
    gcds = []
    for i in range(len(tup)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(tup)):
            g = math.gcd(tup[i], tup[j])
            if g not in s_set:
                return False
            gcds.append(g)
    # Check if every prime p in S appears as a gcd
    gcd_primes = set(gcds)
    return gcd_primes == s_set

S = set(primes)  # set S

# Enumerate all 6-tuples of candidate numbers
for arrangement in itertools.product(candidate_numbers, repeat=6):
    if check_tuple(arrangement, S):
        print("Found tuple:", arrangement)
```
