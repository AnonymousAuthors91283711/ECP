This problem involves a complicated functional equation with the conditions that \(f\) is positive for all positive \(x\). Our goal is to find all functions satisfying the given equation, possibly conjecturing that \(f\) might be a specific simple function like the identity or a constant, but without hardcoding the answer.

Since the question emphasizes enumeration and exploration over specific solutions, we'll generate candidate functions of simple forms and test related values to see which satisfy the equation. We will limit ourselves to simple functions such as constant functions and linear functions to keep the computation manageable within tokens.

Key ideas:
- Test constant functions \(f(x) = c\) for positive \(c\).
- Test \(f(x) = x\) (identity).
- For each candidate, verify if the functional equation holds for small positive \(x, y\).

Because full symbolic manipulation is complex, the program will numerically evaluate both sides for a grid of small \(x,y\) values. This aligns with the requirement to enumerate possible answers and observe which candidate functions satisfy the condition.

```python
import itertools

def test_candidate(f, xs, ys):
    for x, y in itertools.product(xs, ys):
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            try:
                lhs = x * f(x**2) * f(f(y)) + f(y * f(x))
                rhs = f(x * y) * (f(f(x**2)) + f(f(y**2)))
                # Allow a small numerical tolerance
                if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-8:
                    return False
            except Exception:
                return False
    return True

def main():
    candidates = []

    # Constant functions: f(x) = c > 0
    for c in [0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0]:
        def const_fun(x, c=c):
            return c
        if test_candidate(const_fun, [0.1, 1.0, 2.0], [0.1, 1.0, 2.0]):
            print(f"Candidate: constant function with c={c}")
            candidates.append(('constant', c))
    
    # Identity function f(x) = x
    def identity(x):
        return x
    if test_candidate(identity, [0.1, 1.0, 2.0], [0.1, 1.0, 2.0]):
        print("Candidate: identity function f(x) = x")
        candidates.append(('identity',))
    
    # Test linear functions f(x) = k * x
    for k in [0.5, 1.0, 2.0]:
        def linear(x, k=k):
            return k * x
        if test_candidate(linear, [0.1, 1.0, 2.0], [0.1, 1.0, 2.0]):
            print(f"Candidate: linear function f(x) = {k} * x")
            candidates.append(('linear', k))

    print("Summary of candidates satisfying the test:")
    for c in candidates:
        print(c)
