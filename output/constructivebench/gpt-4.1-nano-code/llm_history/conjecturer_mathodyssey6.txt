theorem mathodyssey6 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∃ k m : ℕ, 3 * n + 1 = k^2 ∧ 5 * n + 1 = m^2} mathodyssey6_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 16. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern that the only solutions occur when n=16, where 3*16+1=49=7^2 and 5*16+1=81=9^2, the n satisfying the conditions is uniquely 16. Thus, the answer in a closed form is 16.
