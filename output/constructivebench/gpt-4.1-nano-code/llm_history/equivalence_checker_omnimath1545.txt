Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n * (n - 1)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n * (n + 1) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the maximum number of distinct points in a grid where:
   - All points have strictly increasing x and y coordinates when ordered
   - No two points share the same x-coordinate
   - No two points share the same y-coordinate

2. The ground truth answer is n*(n-1), which makes sense because:
   - For n points, you need at least n distinct x-coordinates and n distinct y-coordinates
   - The maximum number comes from choosing any two distinct coordinates (hence n*(n-1))

3. The proposed answer is n*(n+1)/2, which is the formula for triangular numbers
   - This would be correct if we were counting combinations with possible duplicates
   - But it doesn't match the strict uniqueness requirements of the problem

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It allows for duplicate coordinates which violates the problem's conditions
- The formula doesn't match the combinatorial requirements of the problem
