abbrev omnimath3335_answer : ℂ := sorry
theorem omnimath3335 : 
  (Complex.exp (I * (2 * π / 3))) ^ 6 + (Complex.exp (I * (4 * π / 3))) ^ 6 = omnimath3335_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Root 1 raised to power 6: (0.9999999999999998-1.2212453270876722e-15j)
Root 2 raised to power 6: (1-3.1086244689504383e-15j)
Sum of both: (1.9999999999999998-4.3298697960381105e-15j)
Result is exactly 2.. Expected Answer Type: ℂ
The expressions involve roots of unity. Since \( e^{i 2\pi/3} \) is a primitive third root of unity, it satisfies \( \zeta^3 = 1 \).  
Computing \( \zeta^6 = (\zeta^3)^2 = 1^2 = 1 \).   
Sum of the two terms: \( 1 + 1 = 2 \).  

Answer: <<<2>>>
