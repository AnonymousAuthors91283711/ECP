This problem involves counting the number of pairs `(a, b)` in a finite grid `(Fin 6 × Fin 6)` such that for each fixed `a`, the set of `b` satisfying the condition `(a.1 * b.1 + a.2 * b.2) % 6 = 0` has exactly 6 elements. 

Approach:
- For each `a`, identify all `b` satisfying the condition.
- Count how many such `a` produce exactly 6 such `b`.
- Compute the total favorable outcomes and then the probability over total outcomes.

Since direct enumeration over all `a` and `b` is manageable (36 × 36 = 1296 pairs), implement code to do this exhaustively, then compute the ratio.

```python
# Python program to enumerate favorable pairs (a, b) in (Fin 6 × Fin 6)
# count how many (a, b) pairs satisfy the condition for fixed a
# and verify how many 'a' produce exactly 6 'b' satisfying the condition

from itertools import product

# Fin 6 elements are 0..5
elements = range(6)

# Store count of total pairs where for fixed a, the number of favorable b is exactly 6
favorable_count = 0

# For each a in Fin 6 x Fin 6
for a in product(elements, repeat=2):
    a1, a2 = a
    # Count how many b satisfy the condition for this a
    count_b = 0
    for b in product(elements, repeat=2):
        b1, b2 = b
        if (a1 * b1 + a2 * b2) % 6 == 0:
            count_b += 1
    # If exactly 6 b's satisfy the condition, increment favorable_count
    if count_b == 6:
        favorable_count += 1
        print(f"Fixed a = {a} with exactly 6 favorable b's")
        
total_a = 36
total_pairs = total_a * total_a  # total pairs (a, b)
probability = favorable_count / total_pairs

print(f"Number of a's with exactly 6 favorable b's: {favorable_count}")
print(f"Total pairs: {total_pairs}")
print(f"Favorable outcomes: {favorable_count * 6}")  # each favorable a contributes 6 b's
print(f"Probability: {probability}")
```
