  let sequences := {f : Fin 11 → ℝ | f 0 = 4 ∧ f 10 = 1024 ∧ 
    ∀ n ∈ Finset.Icc 1 10, f n + f (n-1) = 5/2 * Real.sqrt (f n * f (n-1))}
  Nat.card (Subtype sequences) ≡ omnimath2804_answer [MOD 100] := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Number of sequences: 20. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the sequence satisfies a recurrence with a geometric progression format. Since the sequences are defined with boundary conditions and a relation involving sqrt, a closed form likely involves powers of 2 and 3. Given the total count is 20, the answer should involve a factor related to these constants raised to n-1.

The sequence appears to grow like \( 4 \times (\frac{3}{2})^n \) with some adjustments, and the number of such sequences modulo 100 is 20.

Final answer: 
<<<20>>>
