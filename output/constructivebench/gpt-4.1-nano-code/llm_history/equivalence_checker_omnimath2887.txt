Ground Truth Answer: 32
Proposed Answer: 21
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us the equation: 13 + (T - 20)/4 = T with the constraint T > 20
2. Let's solve the equation step by step:
   - 13 + (T - 20)/4 = T
   - (T - 20)/4 = T - 13
   - T - 20 = 4(T - 13)
   - T - 20 = 4T - 52
   - -20 + 52 = 4T - T
   - 32 = 3T
   - T = 32/3 ≈ 10.666...

However, this contradicts the constraint T > 20 and gives a non-integer solution. The ground truth answer of 32 doesn't satisfy the original equation (13 + (32-20)/4 = 13 + 3 = 16 ≠ 32). The proposed answer 21 also doesn't satisfy it (13 + (21-20)/4 = 13.25 ≠ 21).

Both answers are incorrect, but they're incorrect in different ways. The ground truth answer is incorrect but satisfies T > 20, while the proposed answer is also incorrect but closer to the actual solution (though still wrong).
