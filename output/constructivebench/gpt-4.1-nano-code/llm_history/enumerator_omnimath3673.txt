This problem appears to be a theoretical number theory question involving prime numbers, divisibility conditions, and inequalities. The key task is to find all pairs of primes \( (p, q) \), each less than 2005, such that:

- \( q \mid p^2 + 4 \)
- \( p \mid q^2 + 4 \)

and to list all such pairs \((p, q)\).

Since the problem involves divisibility and primes less than 2005, an efficient approach is to:
- Generate all primes less than 2005.
- For each pair \((p, q)\), check the divisibility conditions.
- Collect and print pairs satisfying the conditions.

Here's a Python program that performs this enumeration:

```python
# Generate all primes less than 2005 using a simple sieve
def generate_primes(limit):
    sieve = [True] * limit
    sieve[0:2] = [False, False]
    for i in range(2, int(limit**0.5) + 1):
        if sieve[i]:
            for j in range(i*i, limit, i):
                sieve[j] = False
    return [p for p in range(limit) if sieve[p]]

primes = generate_primes(2005)
result_pairs = []

for p in primes:
    for q in primes:
        if q < 2005:
            # Check divisibility conditions
            if (p**2 + 4) % q == 0 and (q**2 + 4) % p == 0:
                result_pairs.append((p, q))
                print((p, q))
```

This code:
- Efficiently generates all primes less than 2005.
- Checks each pair \((p, q)\) for the divisibility conditions.
- Streams each qualifying pair immediately upon discovery.

Given the constraints, this approach should enumerate all solutions within the token limit and run efficiently.
