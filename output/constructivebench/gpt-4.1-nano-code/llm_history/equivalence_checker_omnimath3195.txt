Ground Truth Answer: 12
Proposed Answer: 11
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find a natural number c between 5 and 10, and a natural number k, such that:
   (c-1)*k + (k+1) = 100
   and k+1 is the unique solution (called omnimath3195_answer)

2. The equation can be simplified:
   (c-1)*k + (k+1) = c*k - k + k + 1 = c*k + 1 = 100
   Therefore: c*k = 99

3. We need to find c ∈ {5,6,7,8,9,10} such that 99 is divisible by c:
   - 99/5 = 19.8 → not integer
   - 99/6 = 16.5 → not integer
   - 99/7 ≈ 14.14 → not integer
   - 99/8 = 12.375 → not integer
   - 99/9 = 11 → integer (k=11)
   - 99/10 = 9.9 → not integer

4. The only valid solution is c=9, k=11
   Then k+1 = 12

5. The ground truth answer is 12 (correct)
   The proposed answer is 11 (which is k, not k+1)

The proposed answer gives k instead of k+1, so it's incorrect.
