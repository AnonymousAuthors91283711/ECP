This appears to be a problem involving calculating the relative change in total revenue based on changes in price and quantity for two products, given initial prices, increases, and quantities.

The key is to interpret and compute the expression:
\[
\frac{ s_q \times (p_s \times (1 + \text{sincrease})) + l_q \times (p_l \times (1 + \text{lincrease})) - (s_q \times p_s + l_q \times p_l)}{s_q \times p_s + l_q \times p_l}
\]

Given parameter values:
- \( p_s = 1.5 \)
- \( p_l = 2.0 \)
- \( \text{sincrease} = 0.1 \)
- \( \text{lincrease} = 0.05 \)
- \( s_q = 2 \)
- \( l_q = 1 \)

Our goal: write a Python script that enumerates candidate answers, preferably with rational exactness. Since the parameters are fixed, the implementation will just compute the formula directly and print the result.

Here's the program capturing this logic:

```python
# Computes the relative change in total revenue based on given parameters
sprice = 1.5
lprice = 2.0
sincrease = 0.1
lincrease = 0.05
squantity = 2
lquantity = 1

# Compute initial total revenue
initial_revenue = squantity * sprice + lquantity * lprice

# Compute new total revenue after increases
new_revenue = (squantity * sprice * (1 + sincrease)) + (lquantity * lprice * (1 + lincrease))

# Compute the relative change
answer = (new_revenue - initial_revenue) / initial_revenue

print(answer)
```
