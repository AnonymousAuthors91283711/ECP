This problem appears to be about counting the number of functions \( s : \mathrm{Fin}\ 10 \to \mathrm{Fin}\ 9 \) with a certain monotonicity condition (non-decreasing) and the existence of a small subset \( t \subseteq \mathrm{Fin}\ 9 \) of size at most 3 such that the image of \( s \) is contained within this subset. 

**Restating the problem:**
- Count the number of non-decreasing functions \( s : \mathrm{Fin}\ 10 \to \mathrm{Fin}\ 9 \)
- such that there exists a subset \( t \subseteq \mathrm{Fin}\ 9 \) with size \( \leq 3 \) and \( \mathrm{Im}(s) \subseteq t \)

Since \( s \) is non-decreasing, its image is a weakly increasing sequence and the subset \( t \) must contain the image.

Let's approximate by enumerating all sequences \( s \), then filtering based on the subset restriction.

**Approach:**
- Generate all non-decreasing sequences of length 10 with values in 0..8
- For each sequence, check if there exists a subset \( t \) of size â‰¤ 3 that contains all values of \( s \)
- Count all such sequences

In code, we'll attempt this enumeration, which is feasible given small bounds (there are \( \binom{8+10-1}{10} \) non-decreasing sequences total).

```python
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement, combinations

# Length of sequence and range of values
length = 10
values = range(9)  # 0..8

result_set = set()

# Generate all non-decreasing sequences of length 10 over 0..8
for seq in combinations_with_replacement(values, length):
    seq_set = set(seq)
    # Check if there's subset t of size <= 3 containing all seq values
    for size in range(1, 4):  # subset sizes 1..3
        for t in combinations(values, size):
            if seq_set.issubset(t):
                # This sequence matches the condition
                result_set.add(seq)
                print(f"Found sequence: {seq} with subset: {t}")
                break  # No need to check larger subsets
        else:
            continue
        break  # Found a suitable subset, move to next sequence

# The total count
answer = len(result_set)
print(f"Total count: {answer}")
```
