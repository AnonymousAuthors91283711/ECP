This code appears to be written in Lean, a proof assistant language, not Python. The problem involves algebraic expressions with powers and fractions, suggesting an exploration of the difference between two expressions involving (2/3) raised to various powers.

To assist in conjecturing the true value of `pA - pB`, let's compute:

pA = (2/3)^3 + (1/3)^3  
pB = 2 * (2/3)^2 * (1/3)^2

Calculating manually:

(2/3)^3 = 8/27  
(1/3)^3 = 1/27

pA = 8/27 + 1/27 = 9/27 = 1/3

(2/3)^2 = 4/9  
(1/3)^2 = 1/9

pB = 2 * (4/9) * (1/9) = 2 * (4/81) = 8/81

Difference: pA - pB = 1/3 - 8/81

Express 1/3 as 27/81:

27/81 - 8/81 = 19/81

Hence, the exact value of `(pA - pB)` is `19/81`.

To assist in enumerating such expressions in Python, let's write a small program that computes and verifies this difference.

```python
# Enumerate powers and compute the difference step by step
from fractions import Fraction

# Define fractions to preserve exactness
pA = Fraction(2, 3) ** 3 + Fraction(1, 3) ** 3
pB = 2 * (Fraction(2,3) ** 2) * (Fraction(1,3) ** 2)

difference = pA - pB
# Print the exact value as a fraction
print("pA =", pA)
print("pB =", pB)
print("Difference (pA - pB) =", difference)
# Also print as decimal for approximation
print("Approximate difference =", float(difference))
```
