  IsLeast {b : ℕ | 1 < b ∧ ∃ (k : ℕ), 1 + b + b^2 + b^3 = k^2} omnimath1748_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: b = 7, sum = 400 = 20^2. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The minimal b satisfying the sum being a perfect square is 7, since 1+7+49+343=400=20^2. Based on the pattern, the answer should be 7, encompassing the sum's value:

<<<400>>>
