This problem involves analyzing the divisors of \( 20^4 \times 11^T \) where \( T = 5 \), specifically counting how many are perfect cubes. To assist in conjecturing the answer, we will enumerate all divisors of the given number and check which are perfect cubes. We will print each such divisor immediately when identified, focusing on the case \( T=5 \).

Key steps:
- Factor \( 20^4 \times 11^5 \) into prime factors.
- Generating divisors from these prime factors.
- Checking if each divisor is a perfect cube.
- Counting such divisors.

Since \( 20 = 2^2 \times 5 \), the prime factorization is:
\[
20^4 = (2^2 \times 5)^4 = 2^8 \times 5^4
\]
and including \( 11^5 \):
\[
N = 2^8 \times 5^4 \times 11^5
\]

Divisors are of the form \( 2^a \times 5^b \times 11^c \) with:
\[
a \in [0,8], \; b \in [0,4], \; c \in [0,5]
\]

Check if the divisor is a perfect cube:
\[
a, b, c \text{ must be multiples of } 3
\]
with the constraints:
\[
a \leq 8, \quad b \leq 4, \quad c \leq 5
\]

We'll generate all feasible \((a, b, c)\), print each divisor that is a perfect cube, and count.

```python
# Enumerate divisors of 2^8 * 5^4 * 11^5 and identify those that are perfect cubes
max_a, max_b, max_c = 8, 4, 5
cube_divisors = []
count = 0

for a in range(max_a + 1):
    if a % 3 != 0:
        continue
    for b in range(max_b + 1):
        if b % 3 != 0:
            continue
        for c in range(max_c + 1):
            if c % 3 != 0:
                continue
            # divisor is 2^a * 5^b * 11^c
            divisor = (2 ** a) * (5 ** b) * (11 ** c)
            print(divisor)  # print each perfect cube divisor immediately
            count += 1

print(f"Total perfect cube divisors: {count}")
```
