Given the symmetric conditions and previous pattern, the 4th powers sum for roots of quadratic with sum s and product p can be expressed as \( s^4 - 4 p s^2 + 2 p^2 \). Here, \( s = x + y \) and \( p = xy = 5 \). From \( x^2 + y^2 = 21 \), we find \( s^2 = 21 + 2p = 21 + 10 = 31 \). Then, \( x^4 + y^4 = 31^2 - 4 * 5 * 31 + 2 * 25 = 961 - 620 + 50 = 391 \).
