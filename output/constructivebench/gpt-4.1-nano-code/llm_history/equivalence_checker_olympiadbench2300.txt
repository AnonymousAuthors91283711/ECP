Ground Truth Answer: {16, 34}
Proposed Answer: { k : ℕ | k ≥ 4 ∧ k % 3 = 1 }
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a sequence (aₙ) that is arithmetic (h_arith) with common difference d ≠ 0 (from h_a1_ne_a2). It also has a geometric property for certain terms (h_geo1).

2. The condition asks when there exists a common ratio s such that a₄ = a₁·s and aₖ = a₄·s.

3. The ground truth answer {16, 34} gives specific numbers where this holds.

4. The proposed answer {k : ℕ | k ≥ 4 ∧ k % 3 = 1} suggests all numbers ≥4 congruent to 1 mod 3 satisfy this.

Analysis:
- The arithmetic sequence has aₙ = a₁ + (n-1)d
- The geometric condition implies r = (a₁ + d)/a₁ and (a₁ + 5d) = (a₁ + d)·r
- Solving these gives a quadratic equation in d/a₁
- The condition for s leads to another quadratic relation
- The solutions only occur at specific k values (16 and 34), not all k ≡1 mod 3

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It claims infinitely many solutions when there are only two
2. It includes numbers like 4,7,10,... which don't satisfy the condition
3. The correct answer is discrete specific values, not a modular condition
