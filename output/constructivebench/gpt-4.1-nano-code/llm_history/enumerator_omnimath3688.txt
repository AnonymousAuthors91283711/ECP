The problem seems to explore natural numbers \( n \) between 0 and 1000 such that the cube of the sum of the digits of \( n \) equals the square of \( n \). We want to find all such \( n \) and define the set `omnimath3688_answer` containing them, then verify the equivalence. To do this in Python, we:

- Iterate through candidates \( n \) from 1 to 999 (since \( n < 1000 \))
- For each \( n \), compute sum of digits
- Check if (sum of digits)^3 == n^2
- Print each such \( n \) immediately when found

This way, we output all solutions streamingly, with no unnecessary computations.

```python
# Enumerate n from 1 to 999
for n in range(1, 1000):
    digits_sum = sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
    if digits_sum ** 3 == n ** 2:
        print(n)
```
