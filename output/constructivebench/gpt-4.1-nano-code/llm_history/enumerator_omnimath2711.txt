[write_program]
This theorem aims to find the least integer `x` such that:
- `x` is odd (since `x = 2 * k + 1`)
- The sum of `x` and the next four odd numbers (`x + 2`, `x + 4`, `x + 6`, `x + 8`) equals 125

The sum simplifies to:
x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) = 125

We can write a Python program to find all possible odd `x` satisfying the sum condition and determine the least such value, enabling conjecture and proof.

```python
# Find all odd integers x such that the sum of x and next four odd numbers equals 125
# x must be of the form 2*k + 1 -> x is odd.

threshold = 200  # Set an upper bound for exploration
answers = []

for k in range(-threshold, threshold):
    x = 2 * k + 1
    total = x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8)
    if total == 125:
        print(f"Found candidate: x = {x}")
        answers.append(x)

if answers:
    print(f"Minimum x satisfying the condition: {min(answers)}")
else:
    print("No solutions found within the explored range.")
```
