The problem involves solving the Diophantine equation \( x^3 - y^3 = 2xy + 8 \) over integers, and we're asked to enumerate solutions to help derive or conjecture the solution set. To make the problem manageable, we will test small integer values for \( x \) and \( y \), and print out solutions when the equation holds. We will fix a search range (say \(-10 \leq x,y \leq 10\)) for feasible enumeration.

This approach facilitates discovery, prioritizes exact solutions, and avoids complex algebraic solving. We will print solutions immediately as they are found, making it straightforward for strategic insight.

```python
# Enumerate small integer solutions to the equation: x^3 - y^3 = 2*x*y + 8
# We limit x and y to the range -10 to 10 for feasibility.

def main():
    solutions_found = 0
    for x in range(-10, 11):
        for y in range(-10, 11):
            lhs = x**3 - y**3
            rhs = 2 * x * y + 8
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"Solution: x={x}, y={y}")
                solutions_found += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
