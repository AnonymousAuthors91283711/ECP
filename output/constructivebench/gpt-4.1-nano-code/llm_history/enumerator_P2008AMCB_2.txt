This problem is about a 4x4 matrix whose entries are defined in a specific way, then constructing a modified matrix by swapping parts of certain rows, and finally calculating the absolute difference between the sums of the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the modified matrix. The key is to find the values that satisfy the property and then evaluate the difference.

Given the formula \( M(i,j) = M(0,0) + j + 7i \), the matrix entries depend on the variable \( M(0,0) \), which is an arbitrary fixed integer. Because the problem is parameterized by \( M(0,0) \), and the row swapping is only between the second and the fourth rows (indices 1 and 3), the main plan is:

- Assign a small sample value to \( M(0,0) \),
- Generate the matrix entries,
- Perform the row swap,
- Compute the diagonal sums and their difference,
- For the purpose of enumerating possible answers, iterate over a small range of \( M(0,0) \) (e.g., from -2 to 2),
- For each, compute the difference, print the result to aid in conjecturing the true answer.

Here's a Python script to illustrate this process:

```python
# Enumerate values of M(0,0) in a small range
for M00 in range(-2, 3):
    # Construct the matrix according to the given property
    def M(i, j):
        return M00 + j + 7 * i

    # Perform the row swap: swap row 1 and 3 values in columns
    M_swapped = lambda i, j: (
        M(3 - i, j) if i in {1, 3} else M(i, j)
    )

    # Compute sums of diagonals after the swap
    diag1_sum = 0
    diag2_sum = 0
    for i in range(4):
        diag1_sum += M_swapped(i, i)
        diag2_sum += M_swapped(i, 3 - i)

    diff = abs(diag1_sum - diag2_sum)
    print(f"M(0,0)={M00}: difference={diff}")
```

This code systematically explores different values for \( M(0,0) \), computes the associated difference, and outputs each result immediately to help with conjecture.
