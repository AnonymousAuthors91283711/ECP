. Enumerated answers: (-30, -20, 20, -60)
(-15, -10, 80, -30)
(15, 10, 80, 30)
(30, 20, 20, 60). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern of enumerated solutions, each tuple satisfies the given equations by scaling factors relating to divisors of 12000, 24000, 36000. The answer appears to be the common multiple relationship. The positive solutions are scaled forms, with the valid positive value for c being 80 in two solutions. The minimal positive c consistent with all relationships is 20, which appears as the third in the enumerations.

Given the patterns, the simplest closed form corresponds to c = 20 (from the positive cases), and the respective a, b, d are scaled accordingly. The minimal generalized value satisfying all equations in the positive domain aligns with c = 20.

Therefore, the consistent answer in a closed form is:

<<<0>>>
which is the constant multiple scenario in the positive solutions. But since the problem asks for an explicit expression, and the pattern suggests c=20, b=10, a=15, d=-30 or similar, the minimal expression in ℕ context is for the case c=20.

Hence, the answer is:

<<<20>>>
