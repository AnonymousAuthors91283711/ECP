This problem seems to be about finding the greatest integer \( d \) such that there exists a submodule \( V \) of \( ℂ^{n \times n} \) with certain properties:

- \( V \) is a submodule (probably a vector subspace) of the space of \( n \times n \) complex matrices.
- \( V \) is finite-dimensional with dimension \( d \).
- Every matrix \( A \in V \) satisfies \( A A^T = A^T A \).

The goal is to determine the greatest such \( d \) for a given \( n \).

Since I must provide a Python script (assuming this is a hypothetical enumeration to help with the mathematical reasoning), I will:

- Fix small \( n \) values.
- Attempt to find all possible \( d \) from 0 up to \( n^2 \) (the maximal dimension of the matrix space).
- For each \( d \), check if it's possible to have such a subspace of dimension \( d \).

Given the complexity of the problem, I will set practical small bounds, say \( n \) from 1 to 3, and enumerate all possible subspaces (via basis construction) up to a certain dimension limit, though in practice this is combinatorially extensive, so I will just check a few representative subspaces or basis generation heuristically.

Here's the Python code that can explore small examples, printing potential dimensions \( d \) for each \( n \):

```python
import numpy as np
from itertools import combinations, combinations_with_replacement

# Function to check if all matrices in a basis satisfy A A^T = A^T A
def check_subspace_condition(basis):
    for A in basis:
        if not np.allclose(A @ A.T, A.T @ A):
            return False
    return True

# Generate small matrices for testing
def generate_sample_matrices(n):
    # Generate some simple matrices: zero, identity, diagonal, symmetric
    matrices = []
    matrices.append(np.zeros((n, n)))
    matrices.append(np.eye(n))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            M = np.zeros((n, n))
            M[i, j] = 1
            matrices.append(M)
    # Add some symmetric matrices
    matrices.extend([np.random.rand(n, n) + (np.random.rand(n, n)).T for _ in range(3)])
    return matrices

# Main enumeration over small n
def enumerate_candidates(max_n=3, max_dim=9):
    for n in range(1, max_n+1):
        max_space_dim = n * n
        print(f"n = {n}")
        # Generate some sample matrices for subspace basis candidates
        samples = generate_sample_matrices(n)
        # Check all subspaces up to a certain dimension
        for d in range(max_space_dim + 1):
            found = False
            for basis in combinations(samples, d):
                if check_subspace_condition(basis):
                    print(f"  Found subspace with dimension {d}")
                    print(f"    Basis matrices (shape): {[b.shape for b in basis]}")
                    print("    (A subspace with all matrices satisfying A A^T = A^T A) exists.")
                    print(f"    So candidate dimension: {d}")
                    print("===")
                    found = True
            if not found:
                # No such subspace of dimension d found
                pass

# Run enumeration at small n
enumerate_candidates()
```

This code:

- Generates some sample matrices (identity, zero, symmetric, etc.).
- Checks combinations of these as basis sets to identify potential subspaces satisfying the condition.
- Prints out the dimensions of any such subspace found.

Note: This is not exhaustive nor rigorous—it’s a heuristic to aid intuition and conjecture, complying with the problem's need for partial, streaming enumeration, and avoiding hardcoding results.
