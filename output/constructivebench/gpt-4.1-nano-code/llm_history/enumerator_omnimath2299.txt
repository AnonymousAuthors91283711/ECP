The problem seems to involve finding the greatest natural number `s` such that there exists a finite set `S` within [1, 12], meeting certain disjointed partition conditions with sums divisible by `k` (for some `k ≥ 2`). This is a combinatorial problem about partitioning sums and divisibility constraints.

Given the constraints, I will:
- Fix small parameters: consider `S` as subsets of [1..12].
- For each potential sum `s`, check if it can be formed under the given conditions.
- Find the maximum `s` satisfying these constraints by brute-force enumeration over small subsets because exhaustive checking of all subsets of [1..12] is feasible within the given limits.

The code will:
- Enumerate all finite subsets `S` of [1..12].
- For each, compute sum and check the partition property with `k ≥ 2`.
- Record the maximum sum `s` where the conditions are satisfied.
- Stream the answers as they are found.

```python
from itertools import combinations, chain

# Generate all subsets of [1..12]
numbers = range(1, 13)
all_subsets = list(chain.from_iterable(combinations(numbers, r) for r in range(1, len(numbers)+1)))

# Function to check the divisibility partition condition
def has_partition_for_k(s, k):
    # We need to check if there exists a partition of S into disjoint nonempty subsets
    # each summing to s/k, and sum s must be divisible by k
    if s % k != 0:
        return False
    target = s // k

    # Generate all partitions of S into k non-empty subsets where each sums to target
    # For small sets, try all possible partitions using recursive backtracking
    def backtrack(remaining, group_counts):
        if not remaining:
            return len(group_counts) == k
        for i in range(len(group_counts)):
            new_group = group_counts[i] + [remaining[0]]
            if sum(new_group) == target:
                # Remove the old group and replace with new group
                new_groups = group_counts[:i] + [new_group] + group_counts[i+1:]
                if backtrack(remaining[1:], new_groups):
                    return True
            elif sum(new_group) > target:
                continue
        return False

    for i in range(len(all_subsets)):
        subset = all_subsets[i]
        for subset_partition in chain.from_iterable(combinations(subset, r) for r in range(1, len(subset)+1)):
            if sum(subset_partition) == target:
                remaining_elements = list(subset)
                for item in subset_partition:
                    remaining_elements.remove(item)
                # Check remaining elements recursively
                if backtrack(remaining_elements, [list(subset_partition)]):
                    return True
    return False

max_s = 0
# Loop over all subsets S and analyze their sums
for S in all_subsets:
    s_sum = sum(S)
    # Check if exists k ≥ 2 satisfying the division condition
    for k in range(2, len(S)+1):  # k can't be larger than size of S
        if has_partition_for_k(s_sum, k):
            if s_sum > max_s:
                max_s = s_sum
                print(max_s)
            break  # No need to check larger k if found one satisfying the condition
print("Maximum s:", max_s)
