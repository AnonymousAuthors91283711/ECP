This problem appears to involve verifying or finding the value of an expression involving specific variables, possibly for particular values of x and y, with the goal of determining an answer for a function `omnimath2768_answer : ℤ × ℤ → ℤ`. Given that x = -2 and y = -1 in the theorem statement, and the expression involves linear combinations, the most straightforward approach is to enumerate the possible values of the answer, especially if there are multiple options, or to verify the value directly.

Since the expressions are linear and given specific x and y, computing the expression directly is the most efficient. To assist the conjecture, I will generate possible integer outputs for the answer, considering all small integers around the expected value to find a pattern, and I will print each candidate immediately.

Here is an enumeration approach, testing a small range of possible integer values for `omnimath2768_answer (x, y)`:

```python
# Enumerating candidate answers for omnimalh2768_answer and computing the expression
# directly for the given x = -2 and y = -1, but also testing nearby values.

# Since the exact answer is not known, we check a small set of possible candidates.
# This helps in conjecturing the correct value.

# For the given x and y, compute the left side:
# (3 * x + 2 * y) - (3 * x - 2 * y)
# this simplifies to: (3x + 2y) - (3x - 2y) = 4y

# Let's verify for y = -1: expected answer = 4 * (-1) = -4

# We'll try candidate answers from -10 to 10 to see if any match this.

for candidate in range(-10, 11):
    # For specific x=-2, y=-1, compute the expression:
    computed_value = (3 * -2 + 2 * -1) - (3 * -2 - 2 * -1)
    # But since the problem involves `omnimath2768_answer (x, y)`, and supposedly 
    # the answer depends on x and y, and the expression simplifies to 4 * y:
    answer = 4 * -1  # for y=-1, expected answer = -4
    # Check if candidate matches the computed answer:
    if candidate == answer:
        print(candidate)
    # Also, for broader exploration, let's consider candidate matching 4*y for y in -2 to 2
    # to assist as a conjecture.
```

This code identifies that the expression simplifies to `4*y`, and matches the candidate if it equals that. However, since the prompt focuses on enumeration, the code will output candidate answers that match the computed value for specific y values, assisting in building the conjecture. The actual implementation could be more detailed if more context were provided, but based on the prompt, this demonstrates enumeration and immediate output of candidates.
