The problem appears to analyze a game situation with a number n (either 2013 or 2014) and determine the winner based on n modulo 6. The problem is to find, for each n, the corresponding winnerâ€”likely "Jenna" or "First player"â€”based on a pattern involving n mod 6.

Given n is either 2013 or 2014, and the conditions depend on n mod 6, I will enumerate the values of n mod 6 for these two inputs and determine possible winners. Since the actual winner depends on whether n % 6 is in {1, 3, 5} or not, I will generate the answers for these specific n values.

Here's the code to produce these answers:

```python
# Enumerate n in {2013, 2014}
# For each n, compute n mod 6 and determine who the winner likely is
# based on the criterion:
# - If n % 6 in {1, 3, 5} => winner = "Jenna"
# - Else => winner = "First player"

def determine_winner(n):
    remainder = n % 6
    if remainder in {1, 3, 5}:
        return "Jenna"
    else:
        return "First player"

for n in [2013, 2014]:
    winner = determine_winner(n)
    print(f"n = {n}, n % 6 = {n % 6}, winner = {winner}")
```
