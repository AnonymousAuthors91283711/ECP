. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → Prop
The pattern suggests the answers increase by 3, starting from 9, for each n ≥ 9. The sequence corresponds to numbers divisible by 3, starting from 9. The pattern for n ≥ 9 is that P2020AMCB_6_answer n is true iff n is divisible by 3 and n ≥ 9. Therefore, the predicate is: n % 3 = 0 ∧ n ≥ 9. The key condition is divisibility by 3 with a threshold of 9. 

Final answer: <<<fun n => n ≥ 9 ∧ n % 3 = 0>>>
