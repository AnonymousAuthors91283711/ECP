This problem appears to involve constructing a function \( a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) with bounds \( 1 \le a(n) \le 9 \), and analyzing the behavior of the reverse digit list of partial sums, specifically whether for large \( k \) there exists some \( m \) such that the number formed by digits \( a(k-1), a(k-2), \ldots, a(0) \) is a perfect square.

Given constraints, the question seems to ask whether such an \( a \) and \( N \) can exist. The challenge is that the problem involves an infinite sequence with a property that for all sufficiently large \( k \), the reverse of the initial segment of \( a \)-values up to \( k \) forms a perfect square.

A brute-force enumeration over small \( a(n) \) sequences with bounds 1..9, looking for a pattern or counterexample, should reveal whether such sequences are possible or not.

Below, I will create a program that enumerates small sequences \( a(n) \) (length up to a certain limit), computes the reverse digit list, forms the number, and checks if it is a perfect square. If so, it will print such sequences.

**Note**: The code will look for sequences that produce perfect squares for the reversed digits in their suffixes, to explore possible candidates.

```python
# Enumerate sequences of digits (a(n) from 1 to 9) of length up to 10
# For each sequence, check all suffixes k > N (simulate large k), 
# whether the reversed digits form a perfect square.
# Print sequences with the property.

import itertools
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    root = int(math.isqrt(n))
    return root * root == n

max_length = 10  # limit sequence length for feasibility
digits = range(1, 10)

# For each sequence of length up to max_length
for length in range(1, max_length + 1):
    for seq in itertools.product(digits, repeat=length):
        # For simplicity, test all suffixes k >= N, e.g., N=1
        # Here, just check if for all suffixes, the number formed is a perfect square
        # Using suffixes from position 0 to end
        valid = True
        for k in range(1, length + 1):
            # reverse first k digits
            rev_digits = list(reversed(seq[:k]))
            num = 0
            for d in rev_digits:
                num = num * 10 + d
            if not is_perfect_square(num):
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            print(f"Sequence: {seq} produces perfect squares for all suffixes reversed.")
```
