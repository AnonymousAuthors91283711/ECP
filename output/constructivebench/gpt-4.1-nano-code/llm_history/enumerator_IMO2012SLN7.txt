This problem involves enumerating sequences \(a : ℕ \to ℕ\) satisfying the conditions:

\[
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{2^{a(i)}} = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \frac{i+1}{3^{a(i)}} = 1
\]

for some \( n \), and determining the possible values of \( n \).

**Plan:**
- Fix small values of \( n \) (e.g., from 1 to a small upper bound, say 15).
- For each \( n \), generate sequences \( a \) with elements in a feasible small range (e.g., \( a(i) \) from 0 to 10).
- Check if the sums obey the given conditions.
- If any sequence satisfies these sums, print \( n \).

Since the problem essentially searches for sequences, we focus on small \( n \) and small \( a(i) \). We prioritize exact sums, so we'll approximate sums with float comparisons. To respect token constraints, the code will be concise.

```python
import itertools

# Enumerate possible n values
found_ns = set()

# Range of n to check
max_n = 15

# Range of possible a(i)
a_range = range(0, 11)

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    # Generate all sequences a of length n with values in a_range
    for a in itertools.product(a_range, repeat=n):
        sum1 = sum(1 / 2 ** ai for ai in a)
        sum2 = sum((i+1) / 3 ** a_i for i, a_i in enumerate(a))
        # Check for exact sum within a tiny epsilon
        if abs(sum1 - 1) < 1e-10 and abs(sum2 - 1) < 1e-10:
            print(n)
            found_ns.add(n)
            break  # No need to find more sequences for this n
# Output all n's where solutions exist
```
