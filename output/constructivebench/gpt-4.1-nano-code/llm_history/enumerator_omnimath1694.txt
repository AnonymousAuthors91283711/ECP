This problem involves analyzing the property P on natural numbers p where p is prime and satisfies a relation involving a perfect square divided by 5. We seek two distinct primes p1, p2 with the sum equal to an answer that meets these conditions. To assist in conjecture, I will enumerate small primes—including those satisfying the given property—and list all pairs that meet the criteria, focusing on small, computationally manageable primes. The goal is to find or approximate the value of the sum p1 + p2.

```python
import math

# List of small primes to consider
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]

# Function to check property P for p:
# p is prime and exists an n > 0 such that 5 * p = floor ((n^2) / 5)
def satisfies_property(p):
    for n in range(1, 50):  # limit n for efficiency
        val = (n ** 2) / 5
        if math.isclose(math.floor(val), 5 * p):
            return True
    return False

# Enumerate primes satisfying P
valid_primes = []
for p in primes:
    if satisfies_property(p):
        print(f"Prime p satisfying P: {p}")
        valid_primes.append(p)

# Find pairs of distinct such primes and their sums
for i in range(len(valid_primes)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(valid_primes)):
        p1 = valid_primes[i]
        p2 = valid_primes[j]
        sum_p = p1 + p2
        print(f"p1 = {p1}, p2 = {p2}, sum = {sum_p}")
```
