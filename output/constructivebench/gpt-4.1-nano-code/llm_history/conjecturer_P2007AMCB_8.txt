The issue is with the use of the variable `T` in the definition of `P2007AMCB_8_answer`. The variable `T` is a parameter of the theorem but not accessible directly inside the abbreviation. To fix this, the answer should be expressed entirely in terms of the parameters `T`, `N`, `c₁`, `c₂`, `c₃`, and their relationships. 

From the enumeration, the ratio consistently appears to be 5, which aligns with the sample solutions where the ratios are always 5. The key formula is that `(T : ℚ) / N = 5`. Since the theorem's goal is to match `(T : ℚ) / N` with a fixed value (here 5), the implementation is simply to set:

`P2007AMCB_8_answer := 5`.

Regarding the variable `T`, to keep things general and correct, we can define:

```lean
abbrev P2007AMCB_8_answer : ℚ := 5
```

This matches the pattern from the enumeration where the ratio is always 5, regardless of the specific values satisfying the conditions.

5

**Explanation:**  
The original code tried to define `P2007AMCB_8_answer` in terms of `T`, which is a parameter to the theorem and not directly accessible inside the answer's definition. Since the enumeration indicates that the ratio `(T / N)` always simplifies to 5 under the constraints, the answer simply is the constant `5`. This is both accurate and general, satisfying the need for a closed-form expression independent of specific values of `T` and `N`.
