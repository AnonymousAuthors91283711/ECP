This problem involves finding a polynomial \( P \) over \(\mathbb{R}\) satisfying certain evaluation conditions and a functional equation, then deducing \( P(-1) \).

Given:

- \( P(1) = 1 \)
- For all \( x \neq -7 \), \(\frac{P(2x)}{P(x+1)} = 8 - \frac{56}{x+7} \)

The first step is to analyze the functional equation:

\[
\frac{P(2x)}{P(x+1)} = 8 - \frac{56}{x+7}
\]

This suggests a rational expression involving possibly linear polynomials, and hints that \( P \) might be of low degree (likely quadratic or linear). 

---

### Approach:
- Choose sample values for \( x \) to get conditions on \( P \) evaluated at specific points.
- Deduce the form of \( P \) (probably quadratic).
- Check the polynomial with the constraints \( P(1) = 1 \).
- Compute \( P(-1) \).

---

### Implementation plan:
- Assume \( P(x) = a x^2 + b x + c \).
- Using \( P(1)=1 \), get \( a + b + c=1 \).
- Substitute \( x \) to satisfy the functional equation at various points \( x \) to find \( a, b, c \).

---

The key is to code this enumeration efficiently, trying small candidate polynomials guided by these relations, then output candidate \( P(-1) \).

```python
import sympy as sp

# Let's assume P(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c
a, b, c = sp.symbols('a b c')
x = sp.symbols('x')

# Condition P(1) = 1
# Constraints: a + b + c = 1
constraint1 = a + b + c - 1

# We analyze the functional equation:
# P(2x)/P(x+1) = 8 - 56/(x+7)

# For sample x avoiding -7
# Choose x=0: P(0)/P(1) = 8 - 56/7 = 8 - 8 = 0, since P(1)=1, P(0)=0
# So P(0)=0
# P(0)= c -> c=0

# Now c=0, constraint1: a + b = 1

# Next, choose x=1:
# P(2*1)= P(2)= 4a + 2b
# P(1+1)= P(2)= same as above
# Left side: P(2)/P(2)=1
# Right side: 8 - 56/ (1+7)=8 - 56/8=8 -7=1
# Confirmed, no new info

# Choose x=3:
# P(6)=36a + 6b
# P(4)=16a + 4b
# P(6)/P(4)= (36a + 6b)/(16a + 4b)
# Right: 8 -56/ (3+7)=8 -56/10=8 -5.6=2.4
# Set up:
# (36a + 6b)/(16a + 4b)= 2.4
# Cross-multiplied:
# 36a + 6b= 2.4*(16a + 4b)=38.4a + 9.6b
# Rearranged:
# 36a - 38.4a + 6b - 9.6b=0
# -2.4a -3.6b=0
# Divide by -1.2:
# 2a +3b=0

# Recall c=0, and constraint a + b=1
# From 2a + 3b=0:
# a= -1.5b
# Substituting into a + b=1:
# -1.5b + b=1 => -0.5b=1 => b= -2
# then a= -1.5*(-2)=3
# c=0

# So candidate P(x)=3x^2 -2x
# Check which gives P(1)=1:
# P(1)=3 -2=1â†’ OK

# Now, evaluate P(-1): P(-1)=3*1 + 2=3+2=5

# Let's verify the functional equation at another x to ensure consistency.

# Let's implement this candidate polynomial:
def P(x_val):
    return 3*x_val**2 - 2*x_val

# Compute P(-1)
answer = P(-1)

# Output the candidate answer.
print("Candidate answer for P(-1):", answer)

# Also, to explore other solutions, try fractional b, but in this case, the derived values are unique.

# Given the constraints and derivation, we output the computed value.
```

This script systematically derives the polynomial form based on sampled points, then computes and outputs \( P(-1) \). This approach streams the most probable candidate answers, aiding the conjecture.
