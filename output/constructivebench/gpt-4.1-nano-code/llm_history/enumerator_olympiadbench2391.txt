The problem appears to involve solving the equation \( n^2 - 10n + 70 = 5 + 10(n-1) \) for integers \( n \). To understand the solutions, I'll first simplify the expression and then implement a Python script to enumerate possible solutions.

The goal is to do the following:
- Simplify the equation
- Enumerate candidate integer values for \( n \) within a reasonable range
- Find solutions where the equation holds exactly
- Stream each solution as soon as itâ€™s found

I will choose a small range, e.g., \( n \in [0, 30] \), which is manageable and sufficient for this problem, and print all solutions immediately.

```python
# The equation to solve: n^2 - 10n + 70 = 5 + 10(n-1)
# Simplify RHS: 5 + 10(n-1) = 5 + 10n - 10 = 10n - 5
# So, the equation becomes: n^2 - 10n + 70 = 10n - 5
# Rearrange: n^2 - 20n + 75 = 0

import math

for n in range(0, 31):
    lhs = n**2 - 10*n + 70
    rhs = 5 + 10 * (n - 1)
    if lhs == rhs:
        print(n)
```
