This problem involves a Fibonacci-like sequence `F` with initial conditions `F 1 = 1`, `F 2 = 1`, and the recurrence relation `F (n + 2) = F (n + 1) + F n`. The theorem concerns the integer `t > 0` such that `F n` repeats every `t` steps, i.e., `F n = F (n + t)` for all `n > 0`. The goal is to find all such `t` for which the sequence is periodic with period `t`, and the theorem states this occurs if and only if `t = omnimath425_answer`.

This is a classic result: the Fibonacci sequence is periodic only with period 1, 2, or the length of the cycle of repeating factors. For Fibonacci, the minimal positive period (called Pisano period) modulo any integer depends on that modulus, but for the sequence over the integers, the sequence is only periodic with period 1 or 2.

The only `t > 0` with the property that `F n = F (n + t)` for all `n` over the positive integers is `t = 1` (trivial period), because Fibonacci sequences are not periodic over the integers with any period greater than 2 (they grow without bound). Still, `F` over integers (not modulo) is strictly increasing after the initial terms. But under the sequence definition, `F 1=F 2=1`, but then `F 3=2`, etc., so it doesn't repeat periodically with larger `t`.

**Step**: Enumerate small candidate `t` values to find where `F n = F (n + t)` holds universally.

```python
# The Fibonacci sequence as per initial conditions
def F(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 1
    a, b = 1, 1
    for _ in range(3, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b

# Check if sequence repeats after t for all n > 0
def is_period(t, max_n=20):
    for n in range(1, max_n - t + 1):
        if F(n) != F(n + t):
            return False
    return True

# Explore candidate periods up to threshold
max_t = 20
for t in range(1, max_t + 1):
    if is_period(t):
        print(f"Possible period t = {t}")
```
