The problem involves finding quadruples (a, b, c, p) of natural numbers with positive a, b, c, where p is prime, satisfying the equation:

\[ 73 p^2 + 6 = 9 a^2 + 17 b^2 + 17 c^2 \]

To enumerate possible solutions efficiently, I'll select small prime p values, compute the left side, and then search for small positive integers (a, b, c) where the right side matches.

Since the equation involves squares, and the left side grows quickly with p, I'll restrict p to small primes (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). For each p, compute \(L = 73 p^2 + 6\), then iterate over small a, b, c, and check whether \(9 a^2 + 17 b^2 + 17 c^2 = L\).

Stream results as soon as an answer is found, prioritizing small positive integer solutions.

```python
import itertools

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]

solutions = []

# Limit search space for a, b, c to small values for practicality
max_abc = 50

for p in primes:
    L = 73 * p**2 + 6
    for a in range(1, max_abc + 1):
        a2 = a * a
        for b in range(1, max_abc + 1):
            b2 = b * b
            for c in range(1, max_abc + 1):
                c2 = c * c
                right_side = 9 * a2 + 17 * b2 + 17 * c2
                if right_side == L and is_prime(p):
                    print((a, b, c, p))
```
