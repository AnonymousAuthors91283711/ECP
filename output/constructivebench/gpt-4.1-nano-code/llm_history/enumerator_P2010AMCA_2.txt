[write_program]
This problem appears to involve summing the numbers from 100 down to 100-5, i.e., summing 100 + 99 + 98 + 97 + 96 + 95. The problem asks to identify the greatest natural number equal to this sum, which is straightforward but let's write a program to enumerate its sum explicitly, helping verify the answer and explore similar sums if needed.

```python
# Enumerate the sum of numbers from 100 down to 95 (i.e., 100 - i for i in 0..5)
total_sum = sum(100 - i for i in range(6))
print(total_sum)

# To verify its extremal property as the greatest sum with the same pattern
# we could check slightly larger / smaller sums
for start in range(95, 105):
    s = sum(start - i for i in range(6))
    print(f"Sum starting at {start}: {s}")
```
