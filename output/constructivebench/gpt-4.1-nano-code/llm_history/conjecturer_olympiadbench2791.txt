  ∃ (k : ℤ) (a d : ℝ), d ≠ 0 ∧
    (X^4 + C (olympiadbench2791_answer : ℝ) * X^2 + C (k : ℝ) * X + C 225 =
      (X - C (a - 3 * d)) * (X - C (a - d)) * (X - C (a + d)) * (X - C (a + 3 * d))) ∧
    (a - 3 * d ≠ a - d ∧ a - 3 * d ≠ a + d ∧ a - 3 * d ≠ a + 3 * d ∧
     a - d ≠ a + d ∧ a - d ≠ a + 3 * d ∧
     a + d ≠ a + 3 * d) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate answer for coefficient of X^2: 66
