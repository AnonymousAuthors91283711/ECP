The problem appears quite abstract, involving collections of subsets of finite sets with certain intersection properties. Given its complexity and the pattern of the definitions, it's likely related to covering or partitioning sets with conditions on intersections, potentially linked to combinatorial principles like the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem or intersection theorems.

To approach this, I will:
- Set small sample values for `n` and `k` to explore possible maximal `m` values satisfying the conditions.
- Enumerate candidates for `m`, attempting to find the greatest `m` such that the conditions hold.
- Do so efficiently by generating candidate collections of subsets and checking the intersection conditions directly.
- As per the instructions, stream partial results immediately when candidates are found.

Since the problem involves sets of finite sets with specific intersection conditions, I'll write an enumeration that:
- Iterates over small `m`.
- Generates possible configurations of subsets `B_i`, `C_i` satisfying `|B_i|=k` and `C_i ⊆ B_i`.
- Checks the intersection conditions for all pairs `(i,j)` with `i ≠ j`.

Here is the code:

```python
# Enumerate possible maximum m for given small n, k
import itertools

def check_conditions(B_list, C_list):
    m = len(B_list)
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(i + 1, m):
            B_i, B_j = B_list[i], B_list[j]
            C_i, C_j = C_list[i], C_list[j]
            # Condition: B_i ∩ C_j ≠ B_j ∩ C_i
            if (set(B_i) & set(C_j)) == (set(B_j) & set(C_i)):
                return False
    return True

def enumerate_for(n, k, max_m=10):
    n_set = list(range(n))
    # Generate all possible B_i of size k
    B_candidates = list(itertools.combinations(n_set, k))
    # For each candidate m, try all combinations of B_i
    for m in range(max_m, 0, -1):
        # Generate all possible sequences of B_i of length m
        for B_indices in itertools.product(B_candidates, repeat=m):
            # For each B_i, generate all possible C_i ⊆ B_i
            C_options = []
            for B_i in B_indices:
                C_subsets = []
                for r in range(len(B_i) + 1):
                    for C_i in itertools.combinations(B_i, r):
                        C_subsets.append(C_i)
                C_options.append(C_subsets)
            # Cartesian product over C_i choices
            for C_indices in itertools.product(*C_options):
                C_list = C_indices
                if check_conditions(B_indices, C_list):
                    max_m = m
                    print(f"Found candidate with m={m}")
                    # The answer is m, continue searching for possibly larger m
                    yield m

# Sample parameters n=4, k=2
n, k = 4, 2
# Let's find maximum m satisfying the conditions
max_m_found = 0
for answer in enumerate_for(n, k, max_m=6):
    total_answer = answer
    print(f"Partial answer: m={total_answer}")
    if total_answer > max_m_found:
        max_m_found = total_answer
print(f"Maximum m for n={n}, k={k} is {max_m_found}")
```
