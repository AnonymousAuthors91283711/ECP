The problem is to find a three-digit odd number m such that:
- digits are all distinct,
- the last digit equals the product of the first two digits,
and then prove that this m is unique.

Given the constraints, the last digit of m (units digit) is between 1 and 9 (odd), and the number is three-digit, so the first digit is between 1 and 9.

We will iterate over possible first digits and second digits, compute the third digit, and check if it satisfies these conditions. Since the last digit must be odd and equal to the product of the first two digits, the product must be a single digit (less than 10).

Here's the Python program to find all such numbers, printing each answer immediately, and then identify the unique answer.

```python
# Program to find the unique three-digit odd number m = 100*D1 + 10*D2 + D3
# where D1, D2, D3 are digits, all distinct, D3 = D1 * D2, and m is odd.

answers = []

for D1 in range(1, 10):  # First digit
    for D2 in range(0, 10):  # Second digit
        product = D1 * D2
        if 0 <= product <= 9:
            D3 = product
            # Check if last digit D3 is odd and digits are distinct
            if D3 % 2 == 1 and D3 != D1 and D3 != D2:
                m = 100 * D1 + 10 * D2 + D3
                # Confirm that m is between 100 and 999, which it is by construction
                print(f"Found candidate: {m}")
                answers.append(m)

# Since the problem states there is a unique such number, find and print it
if answers:
    unique_answer = answers[0]
    print(f"Unique answer: {unique_answer}")
else:
    print("No answers found")
```
