The problem asks us to count the number of integers \( k \) in the range \( 0 \leq k \leq 10^6 \) such that:
1. \( k > 0 \)
2. \( k^2 < 10^6 \)
3. 24 divides \( k^2 \)

Let's analyze the divisibility condition: \( 24 \mid k^2 \).

Since \( 24 = 2^3 \times 3 \), for \( k^2 \) to be divisible by 24, \( k^2 \) must be divisible by both \( 8 \) and \( 3 \).

- \( k^2 \) divisible by \( 8 = 2^3 \) implies \( k \) must be divisible by \( 2^{\lceil 3/2 \rceil} = 2^2=4 \). This is because if \( 2^n \) divides \( k \), then \( 2^{2n} \) divides \( k^2 \).

- \( k^2 \) divisible by \( 3 \) implies \( k \) is divisible by 3.

Thus, \( k \) must be divisible by both 4 and 3, i.e., by their least common multiple 12.

Number of such \( k \) in \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^6 \):

- Divisibility: \( k = 12m \), with \( m \) integer.

- Range: \( 12m \leq 10^6 \Rightarrow m \leq \frac{10^6}{12} \)

- \( m \) ranges from 1 up to \( \lfloor \frac{10^6}{12} \rfloor \).

- \( \frac{10^6}{12} \approx 83333.333 \), so maximum \( m=83333 \).

- Also, from the initial conditions, \( k>0 \), so \( m \ge 1 \).

- For \( k^2 < 10^6 \), check the boundary:

  \( (12m)^2 < 10^6 \Rightarrow 144 m^2 < 10^6 \Rightarrow m^2 < \frac{10^6}{144} \approx 6944.44 \).

  Maximum \( m \):

  \( m \leq \sqrt{6944.44} \approx 83.33 \Rightarrow m \leq 83 \).

Combine both bounds:

- \( m \in [1, 83] \) because both the square and the upper limit constrain \( m \).

Therefore, the valid \( k \) are \( 12m \) with \( m=1 \) to \( 83 \), and \( (12m)^2 < 10^6 \).

To verify for \( m=83 \):
\( (12 \times 83)^2 = 996^2 = 992,016 < 1,000,000 \).

For \( m=84 \):
\( (12 \times 84)^2=1,008^2=1,016,064 \geq 10^6 \), invalid.

Thus, total solutions: from \( m=1 \) to \( 83 \).

Now, let's generate the Python enumeration matching this reasoning.

```python
# Count integers k in [1, 10^6] such that:
# 1) k > 0
# 2) k^2 < 10^6
# 3) 24 divides k^2

# Since 24 divides k^2, k must be divisible by 12.
# Also, k^2 < 10^6 => (k)^2 < 10^6.

# We find maximal m: k = 12*m
# (12*m)^2 < 10^6 => 144 * m^2 < 1,000,000 => m^2 < 6944.44
# So m <= 83 because 83^2=6889 < 6944.44 and 84^2=7056 > 6944.44

for m in range(1, 84):
    k = 12 * m
    if k * k < 1_000_000:
        print(k)  # Stream answer as per requirement
```
