Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 0
Since the problem involves solving a system of equations in real numbers and determining the cardinality of the solution set, the proposed answer "0" suggests that there are no real solutions to the given system. 

However, without further analysis or a clear ground truth answer, it's impossible to definitively confirm whether the proposed answer is correct. The problem is non-trivial, and the proposed answer could be correct if the system indeed has no real solutions. 

Given the lack of a ground truth answer and the complexity of the problem, the most appropriate response is:

<<<None>>>
