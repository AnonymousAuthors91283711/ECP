. Enumerated answers: Total factors of 21! (sample): 144
Odd factors of 21! (sample): 30
Ratio of odd factors to total factors: 0.20833333333333334. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The ratio is the number of odd factors over total factors. Total factors of 21! are 144; odd factors are 30. The ratio is 30/144 = 5/24. So, the answer simplifies to 5/24.

<<<(5:ℝ) / 24>>>
