For n=3, minimal m = 1
For n=4, minimal m = 1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Based on the pattern in enumerations, the minimal m appears to be 1 for various n. The problem asks for the least m satisfying divisibility and inequality conditions for all pairwise disjoint sets in the specified interval. Since dividing by 2*n seems central, and in all known cases m=1 suffices, I conjecture m=1 universally.
