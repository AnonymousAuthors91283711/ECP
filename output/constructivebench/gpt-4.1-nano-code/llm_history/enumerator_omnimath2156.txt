The problem involves analyzing a constructed list `s`, which is based on the range 0 to 728, with digits of 3's representation dropped of leading zeros. It asks for the count of positions in `s` where a pattern `0, 1, 2` occurs within a window of length 3, with the pattern starting at some position `i` satisfying certain conditions.

The core task is to generate candidate sequences and count how many times the sequence `0, 1, 2` appears in `s`. Since this looks like a pattern search in a sequence derived from the digits of the number in base 3, straightforward brute-force enumeration over potential indices in `s` (up to its length) and checking for the pattern can suffice.

The following approach:
- Generate the list `s` based on the range 0 to 728, convert each number to base 3 digits, drop leading zeros.
- Concatenate all these digit sequences into one large list `s`.
- Enumerate over all valid indices `i` in `s` where `i + 2 < len(s)`.
- Check if `s[i], s[i+1], s[i+2]` == `0, 1, 2`.
- Count all such appearances.
- Print each matching index immediately when found to adhere to the "streaming" requirement.
- At the end, output the total count as the answer.

This avoids unnecessary computations, uses simple list operations, and adheres to the problem constraints.

```python
# Generate the sequence based on range 0 to 728, convert each number to base 3 digits
# dropping leading zeros, then concatenate all sequences into one list s.
s = []
for n in range(729):
    digits = []
    num = n
    if num == 0:
        digits = [0]
    else:
        while num > 0:
            digits.append(num % 3)
            num //=3
        digits.reverse()
    s.extend(digits)

count = 0
# Enumerate over all indices where pattern 0,1,2 can start
for i in range(len(s) - 2):
    if s[i] == 0 and s[i+1] == 1 and s[i+2] == 2:
        print(i)  # stream the index
        count += 1

# Output the total count
print("Total pattern occurrences:", count)
```
