This seems to be a problem involving the cardinality of a set of real numbers within the interval [0, 1] for which some iteration of a function \(f\) results in 1/2. Since the explicit form of \(f\) is not provided, and the problem appears to be a contest question (from P2005AMCA, possibly Philippine Math Competition 2005), one common interpretation involves fixed points or iteration properties.

Given the nature, a typical scenario might involve the function \(f\) having special properties, such as being continuous or piecewise linear, with a finite or infinite set of points satisfying the condition. 

To aid in conjecturing, I will:
- Consider a simple class of functions (like affine or quadratic).
- Enumerate candidate points in the interval [0, 1].
- For each candidate, check if iterating \(f\) 2005 times results in 1/2—or closely approximate it—using a small sampled set.

Since the true function \(f\) is unknown, and the identity function or a linear function are common starting points, I'll implement a generic iteration framework and test various candidate points assuming \(f\) is something like \(f(x) = 2x(1 - x)\), which appears often in logistic maps. 

This will illustrate how many points satisfy \(f^{(2005)}(x) \approx 1/2\). Exact algebraic solutions are complicated; thus, a numerical approximation is practical here for conjecture. 

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate points in [0,1], iterate a function, and check if after many iterations the value approaches 1/2.
# Using a logistic map as an example: f(x) = 2x(1 - x)
# This is a common and simple chaotic function, suitable for rough conjectures.

def f(x):
    return 2 * x * (1 - x)

def iterate_f(x, times=2005):
    for _ in range(times):
        x = f(x)
    return x

# Sample points in [0,1]
samples = [i/1000 for i in range(1001)]
approximate_solutions = []

for x in samples:
    result = iterate_f(x)
    # Check if result is close to 0.5 within a small tolerance
    if abs(result - 0.5) < 1e-3:
        print(f"Candidate x: {x:.3f}, after iteration: {result:.3f}")
        approximate_solutions.append(x)

# The output streams candidate solutions that approximately satisfy the iteration condition.
# For exactness, one might need algebraic solutions, but numerical enumeration aids in conjecture.
```
