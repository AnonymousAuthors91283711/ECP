. Enumerated answers: 420. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The answer seeks the greatest ℕ satisfying that all divisors less than \(\sqrt[3]{n}\) are divisors of \(n\). Based on similar problems and enumerations, the largest such \(n\) occurs at \(n=420\). The function output is a constant for the maximum.

<<<420>>>
