This problem involves computing the number of odd integers `x` that belong to a certain set constructed from given integers `d` and `e`, where `d` is odd and `e` is even. We need to analyze the set:
\[
\{ d+d,\ (e+e)*d,\ d*d,\ d*(e+d) \}
\]
and count how many of these elements are both odd and belong to this set.

Since `d` is odd and `e` is even:
- \(d+d = 2d\), which is even.
- \((e+e)*d = 2e \times d = 2 \times e \times d\), which is even.
- \(d \times d = d^2\); since odd\(\times\)odd = odd, this is odd.
- \(d \times (e+d) = d \times (e + d)\). Here, \(e\) is even, \(d\) is odd:
  - \(e + d\): even + odd = odd.
  - \(d \times (e + d)\): odd x odd = odd.

Thus, from the set:
- \(d+d\): even, NOT odd
- \((e+e)*d\): even, NOT odd
- \(d^2\): odd, belongs to the set, and is odd.
- \(d \times (e+d)\): odd, belongs to the set, and is odd.

The only odd elements are the last two, and both are in the set. The set contains exactly these two odd elements.

Number of odd `x` satisfying the conditions: 2.

```python
# Enumerate possible values based on the parity reasoning:
# d is odd, e is even, so the set contains exactly two odd elements: d^2 and d*(e+d). 

# For arbitrary small sample, choose small odd d and even e
d_values = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
e_values = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

results = []

for d in d_values:
    assert d % 2 == 1  # odd
    for e in e_values:
        assert e % 2 == 0  # even
        # Set elements
        s1 = d + d
        s2 = (e + e) * d
        s3 = d * d
        s4 = d * (e + d)
        set_elements = [s1, s2, s3, s4]

        # Count how many are odd
        odd_count = sum(1 for x in set_elements if x % 2 == 1)
        # Store the count and the specific odd elements
        odd_elements = [x for x in set_elements if x % 2 == 1]
        print(f"d={d}, e={e} => Odd count: {odd_count}, Odd elements: {odd_elements}")
        results.append(odd_count)

# The underlying reasoning shows the count of odd elements is always 2
# Confirm by printing the unique counts observed
print("Possible counts of odd elements in the set:", set(results))
```
