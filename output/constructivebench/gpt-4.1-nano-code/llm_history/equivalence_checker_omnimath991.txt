Ground Truth Answer: 3/2
Proposed Answer: 2 + 1/2 + 1/3
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer (3/2) and the proposed answer (2 + 1/2 + 1/3).

First, let's compute the proposed answer:
2 + 1/2 + 1/3 = 2 + 0.5 + 0.333... ≈ 2.833...

Now compute the ground truth answer:
3/2 = 1.5

Clearly, 2.833... ≠ 1.5. The proposed answer is significantly larger than the ground truth answer.

<<<False>>>
