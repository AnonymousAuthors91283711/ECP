The problem involves a polynomial \(f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}[X]\) of degree 4, with specific complex roots, and asks to find the sum of certain coefficients. Given roots \(2I\) and \((2 + I)\), the polynomial factors over \(\mathbb{C}\), and conjugate roots (like \(-2I\) and \((2 - I)\)) are also implied since the polynomial coefficients are real.

Here's how to proceed:
- Assume the roots are \(2I, -2I, 2 + I, 2 - I\).
- Construct the polynomial as the product of \((X - \text{root})\) factors.
- Expand and find the coefficients.
- Sum coefficients \(f_3, f_2, f_1, f_0\) to output the result.

This approach is efficient and uses minimal brute-force with exact algebra.

```python
from sympy import symbols, expand, Poly
import itertools

# Define the variable
X = symbols('X')

# Roots given and their conjugates
roots = [2*1j, -2*1j, 2 + 1j, 2 - 1j]

# Construct the polynomial as the product of (X - root) factors
poly_expr = 1
for r in roots:
    poly_expr *= (X - r)

# Expand to find coefficients
poly_expanded = expand(poly_expr)

# Convert to polynomial in standard form
poly = Poly(poly_expanded, X)

coeffs = poly.all_coeffs()

# Coefficients array: [f_4, f_3, f_2, f_1, f_0]
# For a degree 4 polynomial: f_4 = 1 (monic)
# Sum of the last four coefficients:
result = sum(coeffs[1:])

# Output each sum immediately when computed
print("Sum of coefficients f3 + f2 + f1 + f0:", result)
```
