abbrev P2016AMCA_1_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2016AMCA_1 : (11! - 10!) / 9! = P2016AMCA_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 100. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The expression simplifies as follows: (11! - 10!) / 9! = 11*10! - 10! / 9! = (11 - 1) = 10. The enumerated answer (100) seems inconsistent with the calculation, but based on the pattern and the expected form, the correct answer in this context should be 10.
