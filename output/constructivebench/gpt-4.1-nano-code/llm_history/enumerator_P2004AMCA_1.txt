The problem seems to involve finding a specific natural number related to the expression involving 20, 100, and 1.45. The key is to interpret and compute the expression: floor(20 * 100 * 1.45 / 100).

Given the goal is to find the unique `n` satisfying this, I'll write a Python script to enumerate possible values based on the expression, show the exact calculation, and confirm the unique value.

```python
# Enumerate candidate n values around the calculation
# Exact calculation of the expression inside the floor
value = 20 * 100 * 1.45 / 100  # numerator: 20*100*1.45; then divide by 100
exact_value = (20 * 100 * 1.45) / 100
floor_value = int(exact_value)  # floor

print(f"Exact value of the expression: {exact_value}")
print(f"Floor of the exact value: {floor_value}")

# Since the expression is straightforward, the candidate is the floor
candidate = floor_value
print(f"Candidate n: {candidate}")

# Confirm that there is a unique such n if needed
# In this case, only one candidate matches
```
