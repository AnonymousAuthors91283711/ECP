This problem involves complex numbers expressed as linear combinations of 1 and √5, with positive integer coefficients, and a specific complex number `z`. It asks to determine the minimum of `(a + b)` and `(c + d)` given that the product `(a + b√5 I) * (c + d√5 I)` equals a specific complex number `z = -142 + 333√5 I`. To solve this systematically, we can enumerate small positive integer values for `(a, b, c, d)`, compute the product, and check for matches with `z`. Whenever the product matches `z`, we record `(a + b)` and `(c + d)` and keep track of their minimum.

Here's the approach:
- Fix small ranges for `a, b, c, d`.
- For each quadruple `(a, b, c, d)`, compute the product and compare with `z`.
- If it matches, output `(a + b, c + d)` and track the minimum of these sums.
- Since the coefficients are positive, start from 1 upwards, with an upper bound to prevent infinite loops.

This enumeration is feasible for small bounds given the problem constraints. The program stops after completing the enumeration and reports the minimal `(a + b)` or `(c + d)` found among solutions.

```python
# Enumerate small positive integer quadruples (a, b, c, d) to find matches with z
# and determine the minimal sum of a + b or c + d among solutions.
# Print each solution as soon as found for partial results.

z_real = -142
z_imag = 333
# We'll search within a small range to keep it efficient
max_coeff = 50

solutions = []
min_sum = None

for a in range(1, max_coeff + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_coeff + 1):
        for c in range(1, max_coeff + 1):
            for d in range(1, max_coeff + 1):
                # Compute the product: (a + b√5 I)*(c + d√5 I)
                # = ac + ad√5 I + bc√5 I + bd*5 I^2
                # Since I^2 = -1:
                # = ac + (ad + bc)√5 I - bd*5
                real_part = a * c - 5 * b * d
                imag_part = a * d + b * c
                if real_part == z_real and imag_part == z_imag:
                    sum_ab = a + b
                    sum_cd = c + d
                    solutions.append((a, b, c, d))
                    current_min = min(sum_ab, sum_cd)
                    print(f"Found match: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}")
                    if min_sum is None or current_min < min_sum:
                        min_sum = current_min

# After enumeration, output the minimal sums found
if solutions:
    print(f"Minimal (a + b) or (c + d): {min_sum}")
else:
    print("No solutions found within bounds.")
