Ground Truth Answer: 766
Proposed Answer: 200
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the smallest natural number x such that for some w, the remaining work (after three quarters are completed at different rates) can be covered by workers at rate (800 + x) in the last quarter.

2. The calculation would be:
   - Total work: 1000w
   - Work done in first 3 quarters: 1000(w/4) + 900(w/4) + 800(w/4) = 2700(w/4)
   - Remaining work: 1000w - 2700(w/4) = (4000w - 2700w)/4 = 1300w/4
   - Required: (800 + x)(w/4) ≥ 1300w/4
   - Simplifies to: 800 + x ≥ 1300 ⇒ x ≥ 500

3. The ground truth answer is 766, which seems incorrect based on this calculation. The proposed answer 200 is also incorrect, but in a different way.

4. The correct minimum x should be 500 (from x ≥ 500), so both answers are wrong, but they're wrong in different ways.
