The goal appears to be to determine the value of \(\frac{3b}{a}\) given the relation \(a = 1.5b\), and possibly express it as a percentage or similar. Since the relation is \(a = 1.5b\), we can compute the exact value of \(\frac{3b}{a}\) with this relation, then convert as needed.

To assist in exploring the possible answers and confirming the exact value, I'll write a small Python script that:

- Defines the relation \(a = 1.5b\)
- Computes \(\frac{3b}{a}\) for various small values of \(b\)
- Prints the result each time, prioritizing exact fractions and then floating-point approximations

This way, we can verify that the ratio is constant for all \(b\), confirming the formula.

```python
# This script verifies the ratio 3b / a given a = 1.5b for various small values of b
for b in range(1, 6):  # small sample values for b
    a = 1.5 * b
    ratio = (3 * b) / a
    print(f"For b = {b}, a = {a}, 3b/a = {ratio}")
# Since a = 1.5b, ratio should be constant: 3b / (1.5b) = 2
# Confirming this across sampled values
```
