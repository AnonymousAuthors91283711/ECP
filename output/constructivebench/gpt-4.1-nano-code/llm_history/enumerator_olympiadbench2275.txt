This problem involves calculating the sum of digits of a given number, specifically (10^3 + 1)^2, which simplifies to (1000 + 1)^2 = 1001^2. The code suggests we're working in a Lean-like environment and want to verify the sum of digits of that number.

To help with conjecturing, I'll write a Python script that explicitly computes the number, then enumerates all possible candidates for the sum of its digits, prioritizing the exact sum, and printing intermediate results as it proceeds. Since the number is fixed and small, this is straightforward.

I'll generate all possible sums of digits up to a maximum plausible value (for 1001^2, the maximum digit sum is 4 * 9 = 36) and print the exact sum directly.

```python
# Compute (10^3 + 1)^2 = 1001^2
n = (10**3 + 1)**2
digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]
digit_sum = sum(digits)
print(f"Number: {n}")
print(f"Digits: {digits}")
print(f"Sum of digits: {digit_sum}")
```
