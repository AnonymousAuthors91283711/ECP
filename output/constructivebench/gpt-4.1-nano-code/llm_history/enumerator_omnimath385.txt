This problem involves finding the number of real solutions to the polynomial \( P(x) = x^3 - x^2 - x + 2 \). To facilitate conjecture, we will enumerate possible solutions by examining the polynomial's behavior, particularly by finding roots through approximate methods, then counting solutions.

Our approach:
- Plot or analyze the polynomial's behavior over a small set of points.
- Use a root-finding approach like the Intermediate Value Theorem in a discretized interval.
- Only focus on key points where \( P(x) \) changes sign indicating a root.
- Report the roots found immediately as they are located.

This approach is efficient, does not rely on hardcoded solutions, and streams the partial results.

```python
import math

# Define the polynomial P(x)
def P(x):
    return x**3 - x**2 - x + 2

# Search interval and step
x_min, x_max, step = -3, 3, 0.01

roots = []

# Iterate over the interval in small steps to find sign changes
x = x_min
while x < x_max:
    f1 = P(x)
    f2 = P(x + step)
    # Detect a sign change indicating a root between x and x + step
    if f1 * f2 <= 0:
        # Approximate root using bisection for better precision
        a, b = x, x + step
        for _ in range(50):  # binary search refinement
            mid = (a + b) / 2
            fmid = P(mid)
            if f1 * fmid <= 0:
                b = mid
                f2 = fmid
            else:
                a = mid
                f1 = fmid
        root = (a + b) / 2
        # Only record distinct roots (to avoid duplicates)
        if all(abs(root - r) > 1e-5 for r in roots):
            print(f"Found root at x â‰ˆ {root}")
            roots.append(root)
    x += step

# Count roots
print(f"Total roots estimated: {len(roots)}")
```
