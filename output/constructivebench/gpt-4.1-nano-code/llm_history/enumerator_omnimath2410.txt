This problem appears to involve a spherical or triangle-related trigonometric identity, with parameters A, B, C (likely angles), and side lengths AB, AC, BC, along with given sine ratio conditions. The goal is to find the value of a specific combination of sines, which probably simplifies to a known constant.

Since the exact answer isn't given, I will assume typical geometric constraints and attempt to verify or examine the ratio expressions. To assist the proof or conjecture, I'll explore possible angle values satisfying the given ratios, then compute the target expression. Because the problem suggests small sample values, I'll pick angles like 60°, 45°, 30°, that satisfy the ratio conditions approximately, then evaluate the expression.

Here's the plan:
- Set A, B, C to specific angles (in radians).
- Calculate side lengths or ratios consistent with the conditions.
- Verify the conditions approximately.
- Compute the target expression.

The code will generate candidate sets of angles and compute the expression immediately.

```python
import math

# Convert degrees to radians for convenience
def deg(rad): 
    return rad

# Sample small angles in radians (e.g., 30°, 45°, 60°)
angles_deg = [(30, 45, 60), (45, 45, 90), (60, 30, 45)]
for A_deg, B_deg, C_deg in angles_deg:
    A = math.radians(A_deg)
    B = math.radians(B_deg)
    C = math.radians(C_deg)
    # Assign side lengths using Law of Sines for a hypothetical triangle:
    # Let's choose arbitrary sides proportional to sin of angles (unit circle)
    AB = math.sin(A)
    AC = math.sin(B)
    BC = math.sin(C)
    # Check the ratio conditions approximately
    try:
        ratio1 = math.sin(B) / math.sin(C)
        ratio2 = math.sin(C) / math.sin(B)
        ratio3 = math.sin(A) / (math.sin(B) * math.sin(C))
        # Verify the ratio conditions:
        # h₁: sin B / sin C ≈ AC / AB
        # h₂: sin C / sin B ≈ AB / AC
        # h₃: sin A / (sin B * sin C) ≈ BC / (AC * AB)
        print(f"Angles A={A_deg}°, B={B_deg}°, C={C_deg}°")
        print(f"sin A={math.sin(A):.3f}, sin B={math.sin(B):.3f}, sin C={math.sin(C):.3f}")
        print(f"Ratios: sin B / sin C = {ratio1:.3f}, sin C / sin B = {ratio2:.3f}")
        print(f"Expression numerator: {math.sin(B)**2 + math.sin(C)**2 - math.sin(A)**2:.3f}")
        print(f"Denominator: {math.sin(B)*math.sin(C):.3f}")
        answer = (math.sin(B)**2 + math.sin(C)**2 - math.sin(A)**2) / (math.sin(B)*math.sin(C))
        print(f"Computed value: {answer:.3f}\n")
        # Streaming outputs for each candidate
    except Exception as e:
        continue
