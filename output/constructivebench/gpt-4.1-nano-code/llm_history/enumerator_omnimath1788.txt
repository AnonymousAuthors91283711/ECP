The problem appears to involve finding real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) satisfying a system of three equations:

1. \(a^2 - b c = 14\)
2. \(b^2 - c a = 14\)
3. \(c^2 - a b = -3\)

and then determining the absolute value \(|a + b + c|\).

Let's analyze these equations to get possible solutions.

We will implement a enumeration over small ranges of \(a, b, c\) to find candidate solutions that satisfy the equations exactly, since the problem suggests enumeration and approximations only after.

```python
# Enumerate small integer candidates for (a, b, c) to find solutions satisfying the equations
# The equations are nonlinear; small integer ranges are sufficient for demonstration.

def equations(a, b, c):
    return (
        a**2 - b*c == 14,
        b**2 - c*a == 14,
        c**2 - a*b == -3
    )

# Range based on typical sizes; chosen for feasibility
limit = 20

for a in range(-limit, limit + 1):
    for b in range(-limit, limit + 1):
        for c in range(-limit, limit + 1):
            if equations(a, b, c):
                s = a + b + c
                print(f"Found candidate: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, |a+b+c|={abs(s)}")
```
