The problem appears to involve calculating the probability that, in 5 rolls of a 20-sided die, all five rolls show the face '19', given that at least three of the rolls are '19'. We need to enumerate possibilities to find this conditional probability.

**Approach:**
- Total outcomes: all possible sequences of 5 rolls.
- Favorable outcomes: sequences with exactly 5 '19's.
- Outcomes with at least 3 '19's: sequences with 3, 4, or 5 '19's.
- Calculate the probability as the ratio of sequences with all five '19's to sequences with at least 3 '19's.

The Python program will:
- Iterate over all possible combinations of 5 rolls (each from 1 to 20).
- Count sequences with exactly 5 '19's (success).
- Count sequences with ≥ 3 '19's.
- Compute and print the success divided by total with ≥ 3 '19's.

We'll prevent computing all 20^5 = 3,200,000 sequences explicitly; instead, for efficiency, we use combinatorial counts directly, since the total is manageable using Python's combinatorics.

```python
import math

# Enumerate all necessary counts rather than all sequences for efficiency
# total sequences: 20^5
total_sequences = 20 ** 5

# Count sequences with exactly k '19's:
def count_sequences_with_k_19s(k):
    # Number of ways to choose positions for '19's:
    positions = math.comb(5, k)
    # For remaining positions, 19 options (any face except 19):
    remaining = 19 ** (5 - k)
    return positions * remaining

# Calculate total sequences with at least 3 '19's
total_at_least_3 = sum(count_sequences_with_k_19s(k) for k in range(3, 6))
# Favorable sequences: exactly 5 '19's
success_sequences = count_sequences_with_k_19s(5)

# Output the probability as a float or rational approximation
probability = success_sequences / total_at_least_3

print(f"Sequences with exactly 5 '19's: {success_sequences}")
print(f"Sequences with at least 3 '19's: {total_at_least_3}")
print(f"Conditional probability (all five are '19' given at least 3 are '19'): {success_sequences}/{total_at_least_3} = {probability}")
```
