The problem is essentially asking us to find the smallest prime number p such that p does not divide any number of the form |3^a - 2^b| for nonnegative integers a, b. In other words, p is a prime that never appears as a difference of powers of 3 and 2 in absolute value.

We can approach this by enumerating small primes and checking whether they ever divide any such difference with small exponents a, b. Since large exponents produce huge numbers, we limit our search to small a, b values.

Let's select a range for a and b (say up to 10) for the demonstration, and check which primes do not appear as divisors of any difference |3^a - 2^b| within this range. The smallest such prime will be our answer.

```python
# Enumerate small primes and check if they divide any |3^a - 2^b| for a,b up to 10
import sympy

max_exp = 10
candidates = list(sympy.primerange(2, 50))
primes_not_dividing = set(candidates)

# Track which primes actually divide at least one difference
for a in range(max_exp + 1):
    for b in range(max_exp + 1):
        diff = abs(3**a - 2**b)
        for p in list(primes_not_dividing):
            if diff % p == 0:
                primes_not_dividing.discard(p)

# The remaining primes in the set never divide any |3^a - 2^b| in checked range
if primes_not_dividing:
    # Output the smallest such prime
    answer = min(primes_not_dividing)
    print(answer)
else:
    print("All small primes divide some difference in range")
```
