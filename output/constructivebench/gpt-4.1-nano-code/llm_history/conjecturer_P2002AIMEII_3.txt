theorem P2002AIMEII_3 :
  ∃ (a b c : ℕ), a < b ∧ b < c ∧
    b^2 = a * c ∧
    (∃ k : ℕ, b - a = k^2) ∧
    logb 6 a + logb 6 b + logb 6 c = 6 ∧
    a + b + c = P2002AIMEII_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: a = 2, b = 6, c = 18, sum = 26. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests a proportional relation among a, b, c with a quadratic relation b^2 = a * c, and their logs sum to 6. Given the answer sum is 26, and using the enumerated pattern a=2, b=6, c=18, the sum is 26. Generalizing, the plausible highest common ratio is 3, with a scaled pattern.

<<<26>>>

This matches the provided enumeration and appears to be the sum for the scaled triple.
