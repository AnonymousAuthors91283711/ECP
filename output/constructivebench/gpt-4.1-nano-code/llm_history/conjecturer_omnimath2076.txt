    ∀ i : Fin 4, 4 ≤ Int.natAbs (f i - f ((i + 1) % 4))) = omnimath2076_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: [0, 3, 6, 9]
Maximum minimal gap: 3. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern in the enumerated answers suggests that the value corresponds to the maximum minimal gap, which is 3 in all cases. Since the problem asks for the maximum minimal gap over all such sets, the answer is constant and equals 3.

<<<3>>>
