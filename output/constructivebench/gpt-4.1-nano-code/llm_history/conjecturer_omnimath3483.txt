theorem omnimath3483 : 
  ∃! (x : ℕ), 2 * (x + 7) - 4 = 28 ∧ x = omnimath3483_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found candidate: x = 9 (since 2*(9 + 7) - 4 = 28). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the candidate answer and the equation 2*(x + 7) - 4 = 28, solving for x yields x = 9. The expression should be the closed-form calculation based on the initial relation, removing the existential quantifier. Thus, the answer is explicitly 9.

<<<9>>>
