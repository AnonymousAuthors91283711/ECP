This problem appears to involve finding a prime \( p \) with the property that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some \( n \), and additionally, that the smallest such prime is 17. Then, the second part involves the minimal \( m \) such that \( 17^2 \mid m^4 + 1 \). The goal is to determine this minimal \( m \).

Step 1: Find all \( n \) up to a certain small bound to check for divisibility conditions \( 17^2 \mid n^4 + 1 \). 

Step 2: For each such \( n \), compute \( n^4 + 1 \) and determine if divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \).

Step 3: Record the minimal \( m \) satisfying \( 17^2 \mid m^4 + 1 \).

Because of the problem constraints, only small \( n \) need examining. For efficiency, check \( n \) from 1 up to 866 (since \( 866^4 \) might suffice) but let's limit the search to 200 just to keep it simple and ensure the code runs quickly.

```python
# Search for the minimal m > 0 with 17^2 dividing m^4 + 1
# Also verify that the least prime p with p^2 dividing n^4 + 1 is 17

import math

# Bound for search
limit = 200
prime_square = 17 ** 2

# Store candidates for minimal m
possible_ms = []

for m in range(1, limit + 1):
    if (m ** 4 + 1) % prime_square == 0:
        print(f"Found m={m} with 17^2 dividing m^4 + 1")
        possible_ms.append(m)

# Get the minimal m
if possible_ms:
    min_m = min(possible_ms)
    print(f"Minimal m such that 17^2 divides m^4 + 1: {min_m}")
else:
    print("No m found within the given range.")

# For prime p, check if p=17 is the smallest prime with p^2 dividing n^4 + 1
# Let's verify no smaller primes (like 2,3,5,7,11,13) satisfy the property

# List small primes to check
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
found_smaller = False

for p in primes:
    p_sq = p ** 2
    for n in range(1, limit + 1):
        if (n ** 4 + 1) % p_sq == 0:
            print(f"Prime p={p} divides some n with p^2 divides n^4 + 1, contradicting minimality")
            found_smaller = True
            break
    if found_smaller:
        break

if not found_smaller:
    print("Confirmed that p=17 is the least prime where p^2 divides n^4 + 1 for some n")
