This problem appears to relate to a combinatorial summation involving permutations of finite sets. Given the structure, a typical approach involves examining permutations `a` of `Fin n` and summing the values `(a i).val / (i.val + 1)` over all `i`.

To assist in conjecturing the minimal sum, we will:
- Generate permutations of size `n`.
- For each permutation, compute the sum described.
- Record the minimal sum found.
- Output each candidate sum as it is discovered for conjecture.

Since itâ€™s about finding the least sum over permutations, the search could be optimized by trying some permutations that are likely to minimize the sum (for example, pairing small `a i` with large denominators). But for simplicity, we generate all permutations for small `n`.

Below is a Python script implemented assuming small `n` (to avoid combinatorial explosion). It prints all candidate sums across permutations and identifies the minimum.

```python
import itertools

def enumerate_sums(n):
    # Generate all permutations of indices [0, 1, ..., n-1]
    indices = list(range(n))
    min_sum = float('inf')
    for perm in itertools.permutations(indices):
        # sum over i in [0..n-1]: (a i).val / (i + 1)
        total = 0
        for i in range(n):
            a_i = perm[i]
            total += a_i / (i + 1)
        print(total)
        if total < min_sum:
            min_sum = total
    # Output the minimal sum found
    print("Minimum sum:", min_sum)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Select small n, e.g., n=4 for feasibility
    n = 4
    print(f"Enumerating sums for n={n}")
    enumerate_sums(n)
```
