The problem appears to involve exploring functions \(f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) with specific divisibility and inequality conditions: for positive integers \(m,n\), \(f(m)+f(n)-m n \neq 0\) and divides \(m f(m) + n f(n)\).

Our goal:
- Find all \(f\) satisfying these constraints.
- The theorem states an equality set, probably the set of all such functions; since the problem is complex, we'll try small values of \(m,n\) to identify possible functions.

Approach:
- Enumerate candidate functions \(f\) for small \(m\) (say up to 5).
- For each \(f\), verify the conditions.
- Since the set is over all functions, but brute-force over all functions is impossible, we'll test specific functions, such as linear functions \(f(n)=kn + c\), or constant functions, to see which satisfy the conditions.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate small functions f(n)=a*n + b for n=1..5
# Due to the problem's nature, test simple functions: constant, linear with small coefficients
# and check conditions for m,n up to 5.

def check_function(f):
    for m in range(1, 6):
        for n in range(1, 6):
            val = f(m) + f(n) - m * n
            if val == 0:
                return False
            if (m * f(m) + n * f(n)) % val != 0:
                return False
    return True

candidate_functions = []

# Constant function example: f(n)=k
for k in range(1, 6):
    def f_const(n, k=k):
        return k
    if check_function(f_const):
        candidate_functions.append(('f(n)={}'.format(k), f_const))

# Linear functions: f(n)=a*n+b
for a in range(0, 3):  # small coefficients
    for b in range(0, 3):
        def f_linear(n, a=a, b=b):
            return a*n + b
        if check_function(f_linear):
            candidate_functions.append(('f(n)={}*n+{}'.format(a, b), f_linear))

# Print identified functions
for desc, f in candidate_functions:
    print("Candidate function:", desc)
```
