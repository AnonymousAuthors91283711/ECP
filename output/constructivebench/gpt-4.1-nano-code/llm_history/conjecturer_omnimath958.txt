. Enumerated answers: x = -2.0000, f(x) = 24.0000
x = -1.0000, f(x) = 24.0000
x = 3.0000, f(x) = 24.0000
x = 4.0000, f(x) = 24.0000
x = 2.4142, f(x) = 24.0000
x = -0.4142, f(x) = 24.0000
Approximate solution near x = 0, f(x) = 0
Approximate solution near x = 2, f(x) = 0. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The roots are solutions to \( (x+2)(x+1)(x-3)(x-4)(x - \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2})(x - \frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}) = 0 \), covering all listed solutions.  
Final answer: <<< {x | x = -2 ∨ x = -1 ∨ x = 3 ∨ x = 4 ∨ x = (1 + sqrt 5)/2 ∨ x = (1 - sqrt 5)/2} >>>
