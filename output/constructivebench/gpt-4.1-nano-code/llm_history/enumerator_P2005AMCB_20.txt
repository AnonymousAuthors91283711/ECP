The problem involves finding the minimal value of the sum of squares of the sums of two disjoint 4-element subsets of a specific 8-element set, with the goal of establishing the least such value. To approach this computationally, I will generate all partitionings of the set into two disjoint 4-element subsets, compute their sums, and determine minimal possible sum of squares.

Since the set is fixed and small, enumerating all possible partitions is feasible. The key steps:
- Generate all 4-element subsets.
- For each, compute the complement subset.
- Calculate the sum for each subset.
- Record the sum of squares for each partition, avoiding duplicate partitions (since a partition and its complement are the same in reverse).

Below is a Python script implementing this approach efficiently and streaming answers as they are found.

```python
import itertools

# Given set
s = [-7, -5, -3, -2, 2, 4, 6, 13]
set_all = s

# Generate all 4-element subsets
min_value = None

# To avoid duplicates, process only combinations where first element is smallest
for subset in itertools.combinations(set_all, 4):
    subset_set = set(subset)
    complement = set(set_all) - subset_set
    subset_sum = sum(subset)
    complement_sum = sum(complement)
    value = subset_sum**2 + complement_sum**2
    print(value)
    if (min_value is None) or (value < min_value):
        min_value = value

print(f"Minimal sum of squares: {min_value}")
```

This approach outputs all possible values, allowing identification of the minimal sum of squares, aligned with the problem's goal of finding the least possible value.
