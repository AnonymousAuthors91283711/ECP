abbrev omnimath4087_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath4087 (n : ℕ) :
  1 < n ∧ n^2 ∣ (2^n + 1) ↔ n ∈ omnimath4087_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 3: 9 divisible by 9
. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Based on the divisibility condition \( n^2 \mid 2^n + 1 \), and the enumerated examples, the only \( n > 1 \) satisfying this appears to be \( n=3 \). Testing for larger \( n \) suggests no solutions, and the pattern indicates the set contains only this element.
