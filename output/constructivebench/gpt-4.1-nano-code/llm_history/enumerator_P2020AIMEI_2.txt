The problem involves the unique solution for \( x \) satisfying certain logarithmic relationships and the conditions involving coprime integers \( m,n \) with \( m+n=17 \). Given that \( x = \frac{m}{n} \), and the logs are based on different bases, I'll generate potential candidates for \( m/n \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime and their sum is 17, then check which satisfy the ratio condition.

Steps:
- Iterate over coprime pairs \((m,n)\) with \( m + n = 17 \).
- For each pair, compute \( x = m/n \).
- Calculate \( a = \log_{8}(2x) \), \( b = \log_{4} x \), \( c = \log_{2} x \).
- Verify the condition \( \frac{b}{a} = \frac{c}{b} \).

Stream answers as soon as a candidate satisfies all conditions.

```python
import math

# Function to check if m and n are coprime
def coprime(m, n):
    return math.gcd(m, n) == 1

# Iterate over pairs (m, n) with m + n = 17
for m in range(1, 16):
    n = 17 - m
    if not coprime(m, n):
        continue
    x = m / n
    # Compute logarithms
    a = math.log2(2 * x) / math.log2(8)  # log base 8 of 2x
    b = math.log2(x) / math.log2(4)      # log base 4 of x
    c = math.log2(x)                      # log base 2 of x
    # Check the condition b/a == c/b
    # Use a tolerance for floating point comparison
    if abs((b / a) - (c / b)) < 1e-10:
        print(f"Candidate: m={m}, n={n}, x={x}")
```
