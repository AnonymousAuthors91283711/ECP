This problem appears to involve finding the unique real number \(x\) such that \(x^x = 2012^{2012^{2013}}\). We need to explore candidates numerically, especially since the expression involves a very large exponent tower.

Given the complexity, a promising approach is:
- Since \(x^x\) is increasing for \(x > 0\) and continuous, we can approximate the solution via numerical methods.
- We'll check for values around expected ranges (e.g., near the 2012th root of the tower) with small increments, printing candidate solutions when close or matching.
- We can pick sample values and evaluate \(x^x\), compare with the target, and estimate the root.

Let's implement a straightforward search method with fine sampling over a plausible range:

```python
import math

# Compute the target number
target = 2012 ** (2012 ** 2013)

# To find x such that x^x ≈ target
# For large exponents, root approximations can guide search
# Start range around the 2012th root of the number, which is roughly 2012
# We'll search between 1 and, say, 3000, with small steps

def eval_x_pow_x(x):
    try:
        return math.exp(x * math.log(x))
    except:
        return float('nan')

# Parameters for search
min_x = 1.0
max_x = 3000.0
step = 0.01

x_candidate = None
previous_diff = float('inf')

x = min_x
while x <= max_x:
    val = eval_x_pow_x(x)
    diff = abs(val - target)
    # If candidate matches closely, print immediately
    if diff < previous_diff:
        print(f"x ≈ {x:.2f}, x^x = {val:e}")
        previous_diff = diff
    # Break if within a small tolerance
    if diff < 1e-5:
        print(f"Approximate solution found: x ≈ {x:.2f}")
        x_candidate = x
        break
    x += step

# If no close match found, report the closest
if x_candidate is None:
    # print the closest candidate at the end
    print("No exact match found within range. Closest x:", x)
```
