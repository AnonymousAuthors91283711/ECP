This problem involves exploring the set of real numbers \( x \) satisfying the equation:

\[
\lfloor x^2 - 2x \rfloor + 2 \lfloor x \rfloor = \lfloor x \rfloor^2.
\]

To analyze this, it's helpful to consider the integer part \( n = \lfloor x \rfloor \). We can then examine the behavior of \( x \) in the interval \( [n, n+1) \), where \( n \) is an integer.

For each integer \( n \), \( x \in [n, n+1) \), we analyze the inequality:

\[
\lfloor x^2 - 2x \rfloor + 2n = n^2.
\]

In particular, within each interval, \( x \) varies from \( n \) to \( n+1 \). Since the floor function is involved, for each \( n \), we can list the small sample values of \( x \) in \( [n, n+1) \), evaluate the equation approximately or exactly, and determine whether that \( x \) satisfies the condition.

We'll perform a systematic enumeration of \( n \) in a small range (say from -3 to 3), check a sampling of \( x \) in each interval, and record the solutions.

```python
# Enumerate possible solutions for the equation involving floor functions
# Focus on integer parts n and sample x in [n, n+1)
# For each n, discretize x at a few points and check the equation

import math

# Range of integer parts to analyze
n_min, n_max = -3, 3

# Store solutions
solutions = []

for n in range(n_min, n_max + 1):
    # Sample points within the interval [n, n+1)
    sample_points = [n + 0.25, n + 0.5, n + 0.75, n + 0.999]
    for x in sample_points:
        floor_x = n
        value = x**2 - 2*x
        floor_value = math.floor(value)
        lhs = floor_value + 2*floor_x
        rhs = floor_x**2
        if lhs == rhs:
            print(f"x â‰ˆ {x:.3f} in [{n},{n+1}), with floor_x={floor_x}, value={value:.3f}")
            solutions.append(x)

# Optional: for more precision, you could refine solutions around these points
# or solve exact inequalities, but for this enumeration, this provides approximate solutions.
```
