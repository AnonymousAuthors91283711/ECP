theorem P2011AIMEII_1 :
  ∃ (m n : ℕ), m.Coprime n ∧ 0 < m ∧ 0 < n ∧
  (n - m) * 9 = 2 * (n / 2 - 2 * m) ∧
  m + n = P2011AIMEII_1_answer ∧
  ∀ (m' n' : ℕ), m'.Coprime n' → 0 < m' → 0 < n' →
  (n' - m') * 9 = 2 * (n' / 2 - 2 * m') →
  m' + n' = P2011AIMEII_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solution: m=5, n=3, sum=8
Solution: m=21, n=13, sum=34
Solution: m=37, n=23, sum=60
Minimum sum found: 8. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern where the pairs are coprime and satisfy the equation, and the minimal sum identified is 8, the general form corresponds to the pair (m, n) = (5, 3) with sum 8. The sequence suggests larger coprime pairs with similar structure relate to differences of 2, forming Fibonacci-like ratios. The minimal and prime coprime solution is (5, 3).
