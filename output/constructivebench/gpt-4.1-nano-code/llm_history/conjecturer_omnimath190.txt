The pattern suggests the minimal number \(a_{10}\) corresponds to the smallest sum of a 11-element, strictly increasing subset of ℕ containing 9, with all sums from 1 to 1500 covered. Since the minimal increasing sequence with sum at least 9 and covering 1..1500 extends from the smallest elements, the minimal sum for such a set is achieved by consecutive integers starting from 1. The sum of first 10 positive integers is 55; adding the 11th is at least 10. To cover all sums up to 1500, the sum must surpass 1500. The minimal candidate is a set with elements 1..11 summing to 66, but this doesn't reach 1500. Extending the idea, the minimal sum that exceeds 1500 with an 11-element increasing set starting from 1 is sum of 1..11 = 66. But, considering the problem structure, the minimal such sum is likely \( \binom{11+1}{2} = 66 \) (sum of 1..11). To encompass sums up to 1500, the necessary minimal sum would be intuitively \( \frac{11 \times 12}{2} = 66 \).

Thus, the answer is the sum of the first 11 positive integers:

<<<55>>>
