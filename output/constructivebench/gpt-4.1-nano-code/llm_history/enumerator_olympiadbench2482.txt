This problem involves solving the equation:
\[ 3^{x+2} + 2^{x+2} + 2^x = 2^{x+5} + 3^x \]

Let's analyze the equation to find the solution \( x \). To assist in conjecturing the actual value, I'll write a quick enumeration program that tests some small ranges of \( x \) values and prints out solutions where both sides are approximately equal. The goal is to find potential solutions for \( x \).

The code will:
- Test \( x \) over a small range, e.g., from -10 to 10 in steps of 0.01
- For each \( x \), evaluate both sides
- Print \( x \) where the difference is very small (below a threshold)
- Assume that the true solution is among these candidate points

```python
import numpy as np

# Range of x to test
x_values = np.arange(-10, 10.01, 0.01)

# Threshold for considering the equation approximately equal
epsilon = 1e-6

# Enumerate and print candidate solutions
for x in x_values:
    left = 3**(x+2) + 2**(x+2) + 2**x
    right = 2**(x+5) + 3**x
    if abs(left - right) < epsilon:
        print(f"x â‰ˆ {x:.4f}")
```
