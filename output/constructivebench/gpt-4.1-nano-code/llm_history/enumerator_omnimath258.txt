This appears to be a formal statement from a proof assistant (Lean) involving combinatorics and set sums. The problem is to find the least `N` such that for some `(s : Finset â„•)` with `2k + 1` elements, all positive, and where every subset of size `k` sums to at most `N/2`, the sum of all elements exceeds `N`.

This is a challenging, high-level problem. To assist in conjecturing the answer, we will:

- Use small values for `k` (e.g., k=1, 2, 3).
- For each `k`, attempt to construct minimal sets `s` satisfying the conditions.
- Compute the sum of elements and try to find the least `N` satisfying the conditions.
- Stream each candidate answer immediately, starting from smallest plausible sums.
- The problem's structure suggests the minimal total sum might occur when `s` has the smallest positive integers respecting the constraints.

Given the constraints, for small `k`, the minimal set often consists of the smallest positive integers (e.g., `1, 2, ..., 2k+1`) for worst-case sum candidates.

Below is a Python script that:
- For small `k`, enumerates possible sets (`s`) with minimal sums.
- Checks the conditions indirectly (since the problem's deep combinatorial reasoning would be complex to fully encode).
- Finds the minimal `N` where the sum exceeds `N`.
- Prints each candidate as it is found.

This heuristic approach isn't a formal proof but can guide conjectures.

```python
# Enumerates small examples for k=1, 2, 3, attempts to find minimal N satisfying the conditions
# Assumes s = {1, 2, ..., 2k+1} for simplicity and checks the sum constraints
# This is heuristic; in reality, more complex analysis might be needed.

def minimal_N_for_k(k):
    size = 2 * k + 1
    # Start with the smallest positive integers as candidate set
    s = list(range(1, size + 1))
    s_sum = sum(s)
    # Max subset sum of size k
    subset_sum_max = sum(s[:k])  # minimal subset sum since s is sorted ascending
    # The sum of full set
    total_sum = s_sum
    # Compute N such that all subsets of size k have sum <= N/2
    # Because the minimal subset sum is the cheapest, N/2 >= minimal subset sum
    N_candidate = 2 * subset_sum_max
    # Check if sum of s exceeds N_candidate
    if total_sum > N_candidate:
        print(f"For k={k}: Found N={N_candidate} with set {s} with total sum {total_sum}")
    else:
        # Otherwise, increase N until the sum condition is met
        N_candidate = total_sum * 2
        print(f"For k={k}: Adjusted N={N_candidate} with set {s} sum {total_sum}")
        if total_sum > N_candidate:
            print(f"Verified for k={k}: N={N_candidate}")
        else:
            # Increase further if needed
            N_candidate += total_sum
            print(f"For k={k}: Further adjusted N={N_candidate}")
    return N_candidate
