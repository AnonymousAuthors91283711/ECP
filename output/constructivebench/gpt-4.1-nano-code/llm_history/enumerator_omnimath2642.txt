This problem involves solving the equation \(8 a^a b^b = 27 a^b b^a\) for positive integers \(a, b\), and then finding the sum of squares \(a^2 + b^2\).

Observations:
- Both \(a, b > 0\).
- The exponentiation makes direct algebra tricky, but small values can be enumerated to find solutions.

Approach:
- We pick small values for \(a, b\), e.g., 1 to 10.
- For each pair, check the equation.
- When equal, output the corresponding \(a^2 + b^2\).

Due to the likely small size of solutions, this brute force enumeration is efficient enough.

```python
# Enumerate small positive integers for a and b to find solutions to the equation
# 8 * a^a * b^b = 27 * a^b * b^a
# Then output the corresponding a^2 + b^2 for each solution.

max_val = 10
for a in range(1, max_val + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_val + 1):
        lhs = 8 * (a ** a) * (b ** b)
        rhs = 27 * (a ** b) * (b ** a)
        if lhs == rhs:
            # Output the sum of squares
            print(f"Solution found: a={a}, b={b}, a^2 + b^2={a**2 + b**2}")
```
