The problem seems to involve solving a system of equations involving a parameter k. The goal is to find all k for which the system has some solutions, likely with the constraints given. To approach this, I will:

- Fix a small set of sample values for k, say integers around 1 and -1, since the equations involve k both in quadratic and linear forms.
- For each k, check whether the system has solutions by solving the linear equation for x (if possible) and then verifying if it satisfies the quadratic.
- Stream solutions whenever the system yields valid solutions and identify the corresponding k.

Because the problem involves solving equations symbolically, I will implement a brute-force enumeration of candidate k values and test for solutions.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate small values of k to find those satisfying the conditions
# Check for k in small range
for k in [ -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3]:
    # For each k, find x satisfying linear part: 2*k*x + (5*k + 3)=0
    denom = 2 * k
    if denom == 0:
        # Avoid division by zero
        continue
    x_linear = - (5*k + 3) / denom
    # Check if x_linear satisfies quadratic: k*x^2 + (5*k+3)*x + (6*k+5) = 0
    val = k * x_linear**2 + (5*k + 3) * x_linear + (6*k + 5)
    if abs(val) < 1e-9:
        print(f"k = {k} satisfies the system with x = {x_linear}")
```

This code tests selected small k values to see if the linear solution x satisfies the quadratic. It immediately reports solutions as found, helping to conjecture the set of k values satisfying the problem's condition.
