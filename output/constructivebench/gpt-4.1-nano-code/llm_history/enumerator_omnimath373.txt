The problem involves solving the algebraic equation \( x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0 \) in complex numbers, then evaluating \( x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 \) at those solutions.

To assist in conjecturing and verifying the answer, we'll generate the roots of the cubic equation numerically and evaluate the expression at each root, printing each result immediately. We need to find all roots and compute the target expression's value at those roots (including approximate roots), streaming each answer as we go.

Here's how to do it efficiently:
- Use a small set of sample values in the complex plane (via numpy roots of the polynomial coefficients).
- Immediately evaluate and print the value for each root.
- We avoid hardcoding or assuming the answer, and generate all solutions.

```python
import numpy as np

# Polynomial coefficients for x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0
coeffs = [1, 1, 1, 1]  # Corresponds to x^3 + x^2 + x + 1

# Find roots of the polynomial
roots = np.roots(coeffs)

# For each root, evaluate the target expression and print immediately
for x in roots:
    val = x**4 + 2*x**3 + 2*x**2 + 2*x + 1
    print(f"Root: {x}, Expression: {val}")
```
