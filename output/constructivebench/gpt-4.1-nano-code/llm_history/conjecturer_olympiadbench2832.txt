T=2, N=33, last two digits=(3,3), product=9
T=3, N=132, last two digits=(3,2), product=6

T=5, N=10032, last two digits=(3,2), product=6
T=6, N=100023, last two digits=(2,3), product=6
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The pattern shows the last two digits cycle through (3,3), (3,2), (2,3), with the products being 9 or 6, depending primarily on their last two digits.  
Considering the known values, the product depends only on the last two digits of N, which appear to periodically cycle between (3,3), (3,2), and (2,3).  
In general, for T ≥ 1, the last two digits follow a pattern suggesting:  
- When last two digits are (3,3), product = 9  
- When last two digits are (3,2) or (2,3), product = 6  
It appears that the product alternates based on the last two digits; hence, the product is 9 if the last two digits are both 3, else 6.  

Thus, the final answer in Lean:  
<<<fun T => if (T = 1) then 9 else 6>>>
(Note: Since the pattern stabilizes after T=1 with product 9, and beyond T=1 product seems to be 6, the generalization aligns with observed pattern.)
