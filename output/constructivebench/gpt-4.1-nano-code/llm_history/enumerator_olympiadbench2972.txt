The problem involves manipulating logs and algebraic expressions to analyze a problem from an Olympiad setting. To assist in conjecturing and eventually proving the result, I will enumerate possible values of the involved parameters and evaluate the expression symbolically, focusing on simple, consistent values that satisfy the given conditions.

Specifically:
- Choose small positive values for a, b, c, d,
- Ensure the logarithmic conditions hold with a common base,
- Compute the expression,
- Print each candidate result immediately for exploration.

Since the problem states that \( \log_b a c = T \) and \( \log_b b d = T \), these imply relationships between the parameters. For simplicity, I will pick consistent parameters satisfying these relations directly.

```python
import math

# List of small sample parameters satisfying the given logarithmic relations
# We want to satisfy:
# log_b(a * c) = T and log_b(b * d) = T
# Assume base b > 0, b != 1, and choose b = 2 for simplicity
# Then, a * c = 2^T and b * d = 2^T
# Let's pick T = 1 (so 2^1=2)

T = 1
b = 2
a = 1  # arbitrary positive, to satisfy a * c = 2^T = 2
c = 2**T / a  # 2 / 1 = 2

d = 2**T / b  # 2 / 2 = 1

# Evaluate the expression: (log_b (sqrt(a * b)) * (c * d)^3) / (log_b a c + log_b b d)
# log_b (sqrt(a * b))
# Since a=1, b=2, sqrt(1*2)=sqrt(2), log_b(sqrt(2))= (1/2) * log_b(2) = (1/2)*1=0.5
# log_b a c = T = 1
# log_b b d = T =1
# numerator: log_b (sqrt(a * b)) * (c * d)^3
# c * d = 2 * 1 = 2
# (c * d)^3 = 8
# numerator: 0.5 * 8 = 4
# denominator: 1 + 1 = 2
# result: 4 / 2 = 2

# Printing the candidate result
print("Candidate parameters:")
print(f"T={T}, b={b}, a={a}, c={c}, d={d}")
print("Computed expression:", 4 / 2)

# To explore more, vary T
for T in [0.5, 1, 2]:
    a = 1
    c = 2**T / a
    d = 2**T / b
    numerator_log = 0.5  # since log_b(sqrt(a*b)) with T=1 and b=2
    c_d = c * d
    numerator = numerator_log * (c_d ** 3)
    denominator = T + T
    result = numerator / denominator
    print(f"\nT={T:.2f}, a={a}, c={c:.2f}, d={d:.2f}")
    print("Result:", result)
```
