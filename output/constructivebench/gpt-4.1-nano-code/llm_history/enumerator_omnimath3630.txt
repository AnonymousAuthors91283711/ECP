The problem involves finding a set of four natural numbers such that all pairwise sums of certain forms are prime numbers, and the set's size is exactly 4. Since the original code uses the mathematical language of Lean, I will translate it into a Python enumeration of candidate sets to check the properties.

Key points:
- Enumerate possible 4-element subsets of natural numbers.
- For each subset, check the conditions:
  - All three sums involved are prime.
- To limit complexity, I will restrict the enumeration to small natural numbers, say up to 20.
- Only print answers when all the conditions hold.
- The enumeration will stop once we find all valid sets, or after some reasonable threshold.

```python
import itertools

# Simple prime checker
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Small bounds for candidate numbers
max_num = 20
answers = []

# Generate all 4-element subsets of 1..max_num
for subset in itertools.combinations(range(1, max_num + 1), 4):
    a, b, c, d = subset
    sum1 = a * b + c * d
    sum2 = a * c + b * d
    sum3 = a * d + b * c
    if all(is_prime(s) for s in [sum1, sum2, sum3]):
        # Found a candidate set
        print(f"Answer subset: {sorted(subset)}")
        answers.append(sorted(subset))
```
