Ground Truth Answer: 1 / 2
Proposed Answer: (1 : ℚ)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We have four integers A < B < C < D with specific ratio conditions:
   - (B-A)/(C-A) = 1/5
   - (C-B)/(D-C) = 2/1

2. We need to find (B-A)/(D-C)

3. From h₂: (B-A)/(C-A) = 1/5 ⇒ 5(B-A) = C-A ⇒ C = 5B-4A

4. From h₃: (C-B)/(D-C) = 2 ⇒ C-B = 2(D-C) ⇒ D = (3C-B)/2

5. Substitute C from step 3 into step 4:
   D = (3(5B-4A)-B)/2 = (15B-12A-B)/2 = (14B-12A)/2 = 7B-6A

6. Now compute (B-A)/(D-C):
   D-C = (7B-6A)-(5B-4A) = 2B-2A = 2(B-A)
   So (B-A)/(D-C) = (B-A)/[2(B-A)] = 1/2

The ground truth answer is indeed 1/2, while the proposed answer is just 1 (as a rational). These are not equivalent.
