Total solutions: 6. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern indicates the given points lie on a line within the rectangle \(-9 \leq p_1 \leq 6\), \(-2 \leq p_2 \leq 8\). The equation simplifies to a linear relation linking the endpoints, with discrete integer solutions at fixed intervals. Counting these points yields 6 solutions.
