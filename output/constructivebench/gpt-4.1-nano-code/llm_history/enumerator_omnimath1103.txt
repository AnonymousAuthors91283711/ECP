This problem appears to involve permutations of a finite set with 2013 elements and a sum involving a function counting fixed points. The key points include:

- The function `f σ` counts the number of fixed points of permutation `σ`.
- The sum is over all permutations `σ` in `Perm (Fin 2013)` of `(f σ)^4`.
- The theorem rewrites this sum using `ncard` of the fixed point set.

I will enumerate fixed points counts for permutations, which range from 0 (no fixed points, derangements) to 2013 (identity). Since `f σ` is number of fixed points, and the sum involves `(f σ)^4`, to assist, I will:

- compute the number of permutations with exactly `k` fixed points.
- For each `k` in 0..2013, calculate the permutations with exactly `k` fixed points as: choose `k` points to fix, permute remaining with derangements.
- Derangements can be computed via inclusion-exclusion or an approximation.

The number of permutations with exactly `k` fixed points in `n` is: `C(n, k) * D(n - k)`, where `D(m)` is the number of derangements of `m` elements.

I will:

- Enumerate over `k` from 0 to 2013.
- For each `k`, compute `C(2013, k) * D(2013 - k)`.
- Sum over `k` of `k^4 * C(2013, k) * D(2013 - k)` to find the total.

Since full summation is huge, I will approximate and print key values for small `k`.

```python
from math import comb, factorial

def derangement(n):
    # Approximate derangements using inclusion-exclusion
    return round(factorial(n) * sum((-1)**i / factorial(i) for i in range(n+1)))

n = 2013
total = 0

# Enumerate small k values for demonstration
for k in range(0, 6):  # small sample
    fixed_points_count = comb(n, k) * derangement(n - k)
    # sum of (f σ)^4 over permutations with exactly k fixed points
    contribution = (k**4) * fixed_points_count
    print(f"k={k}: fixed points={k}, permutations={fixed_points_count}")
    total += contribution

print(f"Approximate sum for small k: {total}")
```

Let's analyze the provided problem and code:

1. The problem refers to a theorem involving permutations of 2013 elements, fixed points, and some sum over permutations involving `(f σ)^4`. The function `f` maps each permutation to the size of its fixed points set.

2. The code approximates the sum of `(f σ)^4` over all permutations, but it only iterates over small values of `k` (from 0 to 5), computing contributions for permutations with exactly `k` fixed points.

3. The code prints partial sums for small `k`. However, the problem's total sum likely involves larger values of `k`, possibly up to `n=2013`, or at least beyond 5, since permutations with many fixed points are numerous.

4. The output indicates "Error: Program outputs empty result" — which suggests the code didn't process all necessary permutations, or perhaps the full sum isn't shown, but the code as is wouldn't yield the total sum over all permutations.

5. **The requirements specify:**
   - The program should output answers immediately as it finds them.
   - Should handle the total sum over all permutations appropriately.
   - Should be efficient.
   - Since `n=2013` is huge, enumerating all permutations is infeasible, so at best, the code should compute the sum exactly using combinatorics (not explicit enumeration).

6. **What is the actual answer?** 
   
   The sum over permutations of `(f σ)^4` can be evaluated analytically:

   - For permutations of `n` elements, the number with exactly `k` fixed points is `comb(n, k) * D_{n - k}`, where `D_m` is the number of derangements of size `m`.
   - Each permutation with exactly `k` fixed points has `(f σ)^4 = k^4`.
   - Total sum: `sum_{k=0}^{n} k^4 * comb(n,k) * D_{n - k}`.

   Since enumerating all is infeasible, it's better to use the formula for derangements: `D_m = round(m! / e)` or `D_m = m! * sum_{i=0}^{m} ((-1)^i)/i!`. Then, compute the sum directly with efficient code (preferably for small `n` in demonstration).

7. **Is the code acceptable?**

The provided code is in Lean, referencing Mathlib, and appears to involve permutations of a finite set of size 2013, with some function `f` mapping permutations to natural numbers, specifically counting fixed points. The theorem hints at summing over all permutations and involving the fourth power of fixed points count, but the actual proof and value are missing ("sorry" placeholders). The enumerated answer indicates the program has no implementation and produces an error.

Since the problem is about permutations of a set of size 2013, and involves summing a fourth power over all permutations, a common approach in combinatorics involves applying known formulas for sums over symmetric groups. The sum of the number of fixed points raised to a power over all permutations is a typical problem in combinatorics, often solved using properties of moments or indicator variables.

Given this, a reasonable exact formula, from standard permutation statistics, is:

\[
\sum_{\sigma \in S_{n}} (\text{fixed points of } \sigma)^k = n! \times \text{the }k\text{-th moment of the fixed point count}
\]

For fixed points, the distribution in permutation groups tends to follow a Poisson(1) in the limit, but exact sums can be computed via combinatorics: 

- The number of permutations with exactly \(k\) fixed points is \(\binom{n}{k} D_{n-k}\), where \(D_{n-k}\) is the number of derangements.

- The sum then becomes:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^n k^4 \binom{n}{k} D_{n-k}
\]
multiplied by \(k^4\) for each fixed point count.

In particular, for large \(n\), this sum can be explicitly computed, but computationally, we can directly evaluate or approximate.

---

**Particular to the problem:**

- The set size = 2013.
- The exact sum of fixed points to the fourth power over all permutations is too large to compute directly in code, but for implementation, an efficient way is to use the known formulas or approximations.

Since the initial code is empty, and the prompt asks to produce an executable program that enumerates answers, the approach is:

- Since the problem is large, but the task is about enumeration, approximate or known theoretical results help.

- Given the symmetry and the known distribution of fixed points
