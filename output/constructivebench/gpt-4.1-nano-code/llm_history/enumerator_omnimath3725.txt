This problem involves sets of points on the plane with specific properties related to circles and their intersections. The key constraints are:

- We have a finite set `s` of 2009 points.
- `s` is partitioned into blue and red points with no overlap.
- For each blue point `p`, the intersection of the unit circle centered at `p` with the red points has exactly 2 points.
- We need to find the greatest possible `k`, where `k` is the size of the blue set, under these conditions.

Since each blue point must have exactly two red points on its circle, and the total number of points is fixed, we look for arrangements that maximize the number of blue points.

**Observation:**
- Each blue point relates to exactly 2 red points.
- These intersections suggest a pairing or matching pattern between blue and red points.
- The maximum number of blue points occurs if each blue point uniquely corresponds to two red points, with minimal overlaps to satisfy the property strictly.

Suppose the number of blue points is `k`, then:
- Red points must be at least `2k`, as each blue point needs 2 red points.
- Total points: `s.card = 2009 = blue + red`.

Let's test some small arrangements with this in mind:

- If `k` Blue points, then `red.card = 2009 - k`.
- Red points should include at least `2k` points to fulfill the intersection condition.
- So `2009 - k >= 2k` implies `2009 >= 3k` â‡’ `k <= 669`.

Maximum `k` would be `669` if we can arrange the points so each blue point is associated with 2 red points without conflicts.

**Approach:**
- Enumerate `k` from 1 to 669.
- The greatest such `k` is 669, assuming arrangements exist.

Below is the code that performs this enumeration and outputs the maximum value.

```python
# Enumerate possible k values based on the reasoning above
max_k = 0
for k in range(1, 670):  # up to 669 inclusive
    red_points_needed = 2 * k
    total_points = 2009
    
    # Check if arrangement is possible: red points required <= total points
    if red_points_needed <= total_points:
        max_k = k  # track maximum feasible k
        print(f"Possible maximum blue points: {k}")

print(f"The greatest possible k: {max_k}")
```
