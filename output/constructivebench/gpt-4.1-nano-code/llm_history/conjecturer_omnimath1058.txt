The error occurs because in Lean, an expression like "k – 1" is invalid if 'k' is a variable when used directly in the definition. The correct syntax should be "k - 1" with a hyphen, not an en dash. Moreover, since 'k' is a parameter in the theorem, defining 'omnimath1058_answer' as a function of both 'k' and 'n', the expression should be a function that takes 'k' and 'n' and returns 'k - 1'. 

From the enumerated answers, the observed pattern suggests the answer is 'k - 1' for certain ranges of 'k'. Also, it makes sense because the answer set involves sizes related to 'k', and among those options, 'k - 1' fits the pattern of the maximum size or a related quantity. 

Therefore, the corrected definition is:

<<<fun k n => k - 1>>>

which explicitly expresses that the answer depends on k and n, and the value is 'k - 1', with the proper syntax.

Explanations:
- Used 'fun k n' to define a function of both parameters.
- Corrected 'k – 1' to 'k - 1' to remove the syntax error caused by the en dash.
- The choice of 'k - 1' aligns with the enumerated options and the problem’s structure.

This maintains generality, matches the pattern, and fixes the syntax errors.
