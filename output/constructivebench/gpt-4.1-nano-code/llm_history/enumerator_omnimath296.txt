The problem describes a complex grid with specific constraints: certain blocks are fixed false, others are fixed true, and the grid must satisfy a "no adjacent differing values" (non-bipartite) condition. It asks for the greatest number \(k\) of edges connecting cells that differ in value, effectively the maximum possible number of edges in a non-bipartite configuration given the fixed true/false regions.

The regions at corners are fixed to false, and the interior loop between the regions could be arranged to maximize edges between different values while respecting the constraints. To find the maximum number of such edges, we examine the grid as a graph, considering possible arrangements.

Given the complexity, I will generate candidate grid configurations with small sample arrangements to estimate the maximum edge count, focusing on the "border" regions being bipartitioned for maximum edges, respecting the fixed false regions.

Here's a Python script that for simplicity:
- considers a small 300x300 grid,
- sets fixed blocks at the corners,
- maximizes edges between neighboring cells with different values,
- and counts them, printing each candidate as it is generated.

The script enumerates candidate configurations with greedy arrangements, emphasizing the maximum interface edges.

```python
# Enumerate configurations of a 300x300 grid maximizing edges between differently valued cells,
# respecting fixed false regions at corners.
# For efficiency, analyze only the interior border regions to estimate maximum edges.
def count_mixed_edges(grid):
    count = 0
    for i in range(299):
        for j in range(299):
            if grid[i][j] != grid[i+1][j]:
                count += 1
            if grid[i][j] != grid[i][j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    size = 300
    best_count = -1
    best_grid = None
    # Create initial grid with fixed false in corners
    grid = [['null' for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            if (i < 100 and j < 100) or (i < 100 and j >= 200) or (i >= 200 and j < 100) or (i >= 200 and j >= 200):
                grid[i][j] = False
            else:
                grid[i][j] = True  # interior regions initially set to True
    # Try to maximize edge crossings by alternating interior cells
    for pattern in [True, False]:
        for _ in range(10):  # small sample, minimal loops
            # assign alternating pattern inside free regions
            for i in range(100, 200):
                for j in range(100, 200):
                    grid[i][j] = (i + j) % 2 == (0 if pattern else 1)
            edges = count_mixed_edges(grid)
            print(f"Pattern {pattern}, interior alternating, edge count: {edges}")
            if edges > best_count:
                best_count = edges
                best_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]
    print("Maximum edges found:", best_count)

main()
```
