This problem involves multiple conditions on T, K, r, and d, with relationships involving multiplication, inequalities, and intervals. To aid in conjecturing and proof, I'll enumerate all small values that satisfy the bounds and inequalities. Since T is fixed at 55 in the theorem, and K depends on T, I will focus on the possible values of K given the conditions.

I'll generate candidate K values that satisfy the inequalities:
- \( 20 < T - 5 \Rightarrow 20 < 50 \) (fixed since T=55)
- \( T - 5 < K \Rightarrow 50 < K \)
- \( K < 4T + 11 \Rightarrow K < 4*55 + 11 = 231 \)
- \( 19 < K \)

Also, from the parts involving d:
- \( K = 19 + d \), with \( d > 0 \),
- \( K + d = 4T + 11 = 231 \Rightarrow K + d = 231 \), which means \( d = 231 - K \).

Since \( d = K - 19 \), from the second, we have:
\[ K - 19 = 231 - K \Rightarrow 2K = 250 \Rightarrow K = 125 \]

Check if K=125 satisfies the inequalities:
- \( K > 50 \) ✔
- \( K = 125 \), and \( d = K - 19 = 106 > 0 \) ✔
- \( K + d = 125 + 106 = 231 \) ✔
- \( K < 231 \), since \( 125 < 231 \) ✔
- \( 19 < K \), since \( 19 < 125 \) ✔

Now, the condition involving r:
- \( (20) * r = T - 5 = 50 \Rightarrow r = 50/20 = 2.5 \). Since \( r > 1 \), satisfies.
- \( (T - 5) * r = K \Rightarrow 50 * r = 125 \Rightarrow r = 125/50 = 2.5 \). Same as above.

Thus, for K=125 and T=55, the relationships hold with r=2.5.

I will code a small enumeration over potential K values in the relevant range (say from 51 to 230), check the conditions, and output plausible candidates.

```python
# Enumerator for possible K values based on derived constraints
# T is fixed at 55, as given in theorem
T = 55
K_candidates = []

# Range for K: from just above 50 to below 231
for K in range(51, 231):
    d = K - 19
    # Check if K and d satisfy the relations
    if d > 0 and (19 + d == K) and (K + d == 4 * T + 11):
        # Check the inequalities
        if 20 < T - 5 < K < 4 * T + 11:
            r_numer = T - 5
            r_denom = 20
            r = r_numer / r_denom
            if r > 1 and r * 20 == T - 5 and r * (T - 5) == K:
                print(f"K = {K}, d = {d}, r = {r}")
                K_candidates.append(K)
```
