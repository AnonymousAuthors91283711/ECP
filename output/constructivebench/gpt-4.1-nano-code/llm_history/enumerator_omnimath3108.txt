The problem involves two real numbers \( a = -5 \) and \( b = 6 \), and asks for the value of \( \text{dist } a \, b \). This is simply the distance between the two points on the real line, which is \( |a - b| \). To confirm all possible answers, I will enumerate values around the exact calculation, but since the problem is straightforward, the key is just to compute the absolute difference.

Here's a Python program that computes and prints the distance, verifying correctness in a straightforward manner, and also identifying any potential approximations (though unlikely here).

```python
# Compute the distance between a = -5 and b = 6
a = -5
b = 6

# Exact distance
distance = abs(a - b)
print(f"Exact distance: {distance}")

# As the distance between two real numbers is well-defined and fixed,
# no enumeration over multiple values is needed. But for demonstration:
# Enumerate over small epsilon deviations around the exact difference,
# prioritizing the exact value.

epsilons = [0, 0.1, -0.1]  # small deviations
for delta in epsilons:
    approx_distance = abs((a - b) + delta)
    print(f"Approximate distance with delta {delta}: {approx_distance}")

# The primary answer is the exact distance
print(f"dist {a} {b} = {distance}")
```
