[write_program]
This problem involves solving the equation \( 2^x \times (4 - x) = 2x + 4 \) for non-negative integers \( x \). To assist in conjecturing the solutions, I will write a Python program to enumerate small values of \( x \) (e.g., from 0 up to 20) and check which satisfy the equation exactly.

The program will print each candidate \( x \) that satisfies the equation immediately when found, focusing on exact integer solutions. Since the problem is at a high-school level, the enumeration range is kept small for efficiency.

```python
# Enumerate x from 0 to 20 and check if 2^x * (4 - x) == 2 x + 4
# Print all solutions immediately when found

for x in range(21):
    lhs = (2 ** x) * (4 - x)
    rhs = 2 * x + 4
    if lhs == rhs:
        print(f"Solution: x = {x}")
```
