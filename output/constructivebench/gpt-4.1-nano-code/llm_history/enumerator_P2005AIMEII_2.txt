Certainly! The problem appears to involve a probability computation based on combinatorial choices. To proceed, I will:

- Calculate the total number of ways: choose 3 from 9, then 3 from 6, then 3 from 3.
- Calculate the favorable outcomes as 6 times 3!^3.
- Express the probability as a fraction and find the simplified numerator and denominator with their greatest common divisor (gcd) to reduce the fraction.
- Output the numerator and denominator as an ordered pair, ensuring that numerator and denominator are coprime.

Here's the code that implements this logic:

```python
from math import gcd, factorial
from fractions import Fraction

# Calculate total number of ways
total = factorial(9) // (factorial(6) * factorial(3)) * factorial(6) // (factorial(3) * factorial(3)) * factorial(3) // (factorial(3))
# Calculate favorable outcomes
favorable = 6 * (factorial(3) ** 3)

# Compute the fraction
prob_fraction = Fraction(favorable, total).limit_denominator()

# Output numerator and denominator (they are coprime)
print(prob_fraction.numerator, prob_fraction.denominator)
```
