The problem involves finding the cardinality of pairs \((p_1, p_2)\) with both at least 1, such that the sum over \(k=0\) to 11 of \(\log_8(p_1 \times p_2^k)\) equals 2006. The sum simplifies to:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{11} \left( \log_8 p_1 + k \log_8 p_2 \right) = 12 \log_8 p_1 + \left(\sum_{k=0}^{11} k \right) \log_8 p_2
\]

The sum of \(k = 0\) to 11 is \(\frac{11 \times 12}{2} = 66\). So the sum becomes:

\[
12 \log_8 p_1 + 66 \log_8 p_2 = 2006
\]

Let:

\[
x = \log_8 p_1, \quad y = \log_8 p_2
\]

then:

\[
12x + 66 y = 2006
\]

Divide through by 6:

\[
2x + 11 y = \frac{2006}{6} \approx 334.333...
\]

To have integer solutions, \(p_1 = 8^x, p_2 = 8^y\) are powers of 8 with integer exponents. Since \(p_1, p_2 \ge 1 \Rightarrow x, y \ge 0\), we look for integer \(x, y \ge 0\) satisfying:

\[
2x + 11 y = 2006 / 6
\]

But \(2006/6\) is not an integer, so the right side is fractional, unless the numerator divides evenly by 6. Let's check:

\[
2006 \div 6 = 334.333...
\]

No. Therefore, for any integer \(x, y \ge 0\), the LHS is integer, but RHS isn't. So solutions only exist if the RHS is integer, which is not. But wait, the original sum involves logs base 8, which are real, so solutions can involve rational exponents.

Instead, note:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{11} \log_8 (p_1 p_2^k) = \sum_{k=0}^{11} (\log_8 p_1 + k \log_8 p_2) = 12 \log_8 p_1 + (0+1+...+11) \log_8 p_2 = 12 \log_8 p_1 + 66 \log_8 p_2
\]

Let \(A = \log_8 p_1\), \(B= \log_8 p_2\), then:

\[
12A + 66 B = 2006
\]

which can be written as:

\[
2A + 11 B = \frac{2006}{6} = 334.333...
\]

Non-integer, implying that unless the right side is a multiple of 1, solutions with integer exponents for \(p_1, p_2\) are impossible. But the problem seems to permit real exponents, so the total sum is real; the goal is to count integer pairs \(p_1, p_2 \ge 1\) with:

\[
12 \log_8 p_1 + 66 \log_8 p_2 = 2006
\]

Expressed in terms of \(p_1, p_2\):

\[
p_1 = 8^A, p_2=8^B
\]

The sum is:

\[
12 A + 66 B = 2006
\]

We can view \(A, B\) as real variables satisfying this linear relation. For each solution, the pair:

\[
p_1 = 8^A, \quad p_2=8^B
\]

belongs to \(\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}\) if and only if \(A, B \in \mathbb{Q}\), with \(A = \log_8 p_1\), etc.

Thus, the problem reduces to counting the number of rational solutions \((A,B)\) with \(p_1=8^A \ge 1 \Rightarrow A \ge 0\), similar for \(p_2\).

Given the linear constraint:

\[
12 A + 66 B = 2006
\]

for \(A, B \ge 0\).

Let's generate pairs \((A,B)\) with rational exponents, such that \(p_1=8^A\), \(p_2=8^B\) are positive integers.

Since 8 is a power of 2, \(8^{A} = 2^{3A}\). For \(p_1\) to be an integer, \(2^{3A}\) is integer iff \(3A\) is an integer.

Similarly for \(p_2 = 2^{3B}\).

Thus, \(A, B\) are rational with denominators dividing 3.

Let:

\[
A = \frac{a}{3}, \quad B = \frac{b}{3}
\]

then:

\[
12 \frac{a}{3} + 66 \frac{b}{3} = 2006
\]
\[
4a + 22b = 2006
\]

\(a, b\) are integers.

Constraints:

\[
A = \frac{a}{3} \ge 0 \Rightarrow a \ge 0
\]
\[
B= \frac{b}{3} \ge 0 \Rightarrow b \ge 0
\]

Equation:

\[
4a + 22b=2006
\]

Divide through by 2:

\[
2a + 11b = 1003
\]

Now, in integers:

\[
2a + 11b=1003
\]

with \(a, b \ge 0\).

Our task: find all nonnegative integer solutions \((a, b)\) to this.

Express \(a\):

\[
a = \frac{1003 - 11b}{2}
\]

\(a\) integer only if numerator even.

Check parity:

- 1003 is odd.
- 11b: odd \(\times\) \(b\):

    - If \(b\) is even, \(11b\) is even, so \(1003 - 11b\) is odd - even = odd. *Then* \(a\) = odd/2, not integer.
    - If \(b\) is odd, \(11b\) is odd, odd minus odd = even, so numerator is even, \(a\) is integer.

In total:

- \(b\) must be odd for \(a\) to be integral.

Now, \(a \ge 0\):

\[
a = \frac{1003 - 11b}{2} \ge 0
\]
\[
1003 - 11b \ge 0 \Rightarrow 11b \le 1003 \Rightarrow b \le \frac{1003}{11} \approx 91.18
\]

Since \(b\) is a nonnegative odd integer:

\[
b \in \{1,3,5,...,91\}
\]

For each such \(b\), compute \(a\):

\[
a = \frac{1003 - 11b}{2}
\]

which will be an integer \(\ge 0\).

Corresponding \(p_1 = 8^{a/3}\), \(p_2=8^{b/3}\):

\[
p_1=2^{3a/3} = 2^{a}
\]

\[
p_2=2^{b}
\]

Since \(\gcd(a,b)\) are integers, \(p_1=2^{a}\), \(p_2=2^{b}\), both integers, with \(a,b \ge 0\), as desired.

Now, explicitly iterate over \(b\):

- For each odd \(b\) in 1 to 91:

    - Compute \(a = (1003 - 11b)/2\).
    - \(a \ge 0\), so check.

Finally, for each, determine \(p_1=2^a\), \(p_2=2^b\).

Since the pairs are positive integers, the total count is the number of such solutions.

Let's implement this:

```python
# Enumerate solutions for b in 1..91, odd, where (1003 - 11b) divisible by 2 and >=0
solutions = []

for b in range(1, 92, 2):  # odd b from 1 to 91
    numerator = 1003 - 11 * b
    if numerator >= 0 and numerator % 2 == 0:
        a = numerator // 2
        p1 = 2 ** a
        p2 = 2 ** b
        # Both p1 and p2 are at least 1
        solutions.append((p1, p2))
        print(f"Solution: p1={p1}, p2={p2}")
print(f"Total solutions: {len(solutions)}")
```

This enumerates all such pairs, and their count gives the answer.

```python
# Python code to enumerate solutions satisfying the derived conditions
solutions = []

for b in range(1, 92, 2):  # b odd from 1 to 91
    numerator = 1003 - 11 * b
    if numerator >= 0 and numerator % 2 == 0:
        a = numerator // 2
        p1 = 2 ** a
        p2 = 2 ** b
        solutions.append((p1, p2))
        print(f"p1={p1}, p2={p2}")

# The count of solutions is the answer
abbrev_answer = len(solutions)
```
