[write_program]
The problem seems to involve iterating a set transformation T, which adds neighbors in four directions, starting from the initial point (0,0), and applying it 14 times. The question is likely about counting the total number of points obtained after these iterations, perhaps related to a grid expansion or a lattice fragmentation problem.

I will write a Python program that:
- Simulates the expansion from (0,0) applying the neighbor-adding rule exactly 14 times.
- Tracks all points added during the process.
- Counts total number of points after 14 iterations.

This aligns with the set T's definition, where each iteration adds neighbors in the four directions.

```python
# Import necessary data structures
from collections import deque

def iterate_set(initial_points, steps):
    # Initialize a set with initial points
    current_points = set(initial_points)
    # Use a queue to process points level by level
    queue = deque()
    for p in initial_points:
        queue.append((p, 0))  # point with step count

    while queue:
        (x, y), step = queue.popleft()
        if step >= steps:
            continue
        # Add neighbors
        neighbors = [(x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), (x, y-1)]
        for nb in neighbors:
            if nb not in current_points:
                current_points.add(nb)
                queue.append((nb, step+1))
    return current_points

# Starting point
start = {(0,0)}
# Number of iterations
iterations = 14
# Run expansion
result_points = iterate_set(start, iterations)
# Output the count
print(len(result_points))
```
