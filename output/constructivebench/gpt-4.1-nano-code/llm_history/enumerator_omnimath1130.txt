The given theorem involves a deeply nested sum structure: summing over ranges depending on variables n0 through n60, each from 0 up to the current n-variable. Ultimately, the outer sum adds 1 for each possible combination of these variables.

This structure essentially counts the number of all possible tuples (n0, n1, ..., n60), where each n_i ranges from 0 to n_{i-1}. Since each sum adds all values in the range [0, n_{i-1}], the total sum counts the total number of such sequences that satisfy 0 ≤ n0 ≤ n1 ≤ ... ≤ n60, with the initial sum involving the most nested range at each stage.

Given the structure, the entire sum computes the number of weakly increasing sequences starting at 0 and ending at n60, where each step is at least 0 and at most n_{i-1}. When summing over all possible n0..n60, the total count becomes the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 61 (from n0 to n60), with each element in [0, n60], summed over all possible n60.

A common combinatorial identity for counting weakly increasing sequences (non-decreasing sequences) of length k with maximum n is:

Number of non-decreasing sequences of length k with maximum ≤ n = C(n + k, k)

Summing over all n from 0 to n, the total count is:

∑_{n=0}^N C(n + k, k)

which simplifies to C(N + k + 1, k + 1) (by hockey-stick identities).

In our case, with length 61 (since from n0 to n60), and maximum n60 = N, the total sum equals C(N + 61, 61).

For the sum where the maximum value n60 is unbounded (but in our sum, it is summed over all possible n60), the total number of sequences is the same as the number of sequences (n0,…,n60) with 0 ≤ n0 ≤ n1 ≤ ... ≤ n60, which equals the number of weakly increasing sequences of length 61 with entries from [0, N]. Summed over all N, this is the total number of sequences of length 61 with arbitrary values starting at 0 and being non-decreasing.

In the nested sum, because of the structure, the total sum equals the number of sequences where each subsequent n_i is at least n_{i-1} and less than or equal to n_{i+1} (monotonically non-decreasing), over the possible ranges.

The total number of these sequences for fixed n60 is:

Sum_{n=0}^{n60} C(n + 60, 60) = C(n60 + 61, 61)

Thus, summing over n60 from 0 to some N, total is:

∑_{n=0}^N C(n + 61, 61) = C(N + 62, 62).

Given that, at the topmost level, the total sum over all possible n60 (which is unbounded in the sum, but here finite), will be C(N+62,62).

To illustrate, for small N, the sum is:

- For N=0: C(62,62) = 1

- For N=1: C(63,62) = 63

- For N=2: C(64,62) = (64*63)/2 = 2016

More generally, the sum evaluates to binomial coefficients.

Since the sum is a combinatorial count, the sequence of answers for increasing top N is:

F(N) = C(N+62,62)

Because our sum is over sequences equating to these counts, for the entire finite summation from N=0 to N, this sum is the binomial coefficient C(N+62,62).

In our problem's code, summing over the entire nested sum reduces to that binomial coefficient with N=maximum n60.

Assuming the sum over all possible n60s, the total counts matches C(61+N, 62). 

The problem may be conceptual: the total sum evaluates to 1 when all sums are over ranges from 0 to 0 (N=0), i.e. the simplest case.

**Implementation plan**:

Given the reasoning, the sum evaluates to binomial coefficient C(n60 + 61, 61). The cumulatively summed counts over all possible n60 up to some N are C(N + 62, 62).

Given the nested sums and the structure, the total sum for the given nested sum (allowing n60 up to some N) equals C(N + 62, 62).

Since the code appears to sum over all possible ranges (i.e., sums over all n0..n60 with no upper bounds), the total answer is infinite unless bounded.

For this setting, to match the abstract sum, we can:

- Choose a small N as an example, say N=0, sum is 1.
- N=1, sum is 63.
- N=2, sum is 2016.

Now, **implement a Python program** to compute C(N+62, 62) for small N values, printing the exact binomial coefficient.

```python
from math import comb

def compute_sum_for_N(N):
    # This directly computes C(N + 62, 62)
    return comb(N + 62, 62)

# Example: enumerate for N=0 to 3
for N in range(4):
    answer = compute_sum_for_N(N)
    print(f"For N = {N}, total count = {answer}")
```

This code computes and prints exact binomial coefficients for small N, which aligns with the understanding of the nested sums, enabling partial guesses and patterns for the final answer.
