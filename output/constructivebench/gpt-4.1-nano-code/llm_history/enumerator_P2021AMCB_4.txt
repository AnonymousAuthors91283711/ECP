The problem appears to involve basic arithmetic calculations with fractions, specifically verifying the value of \(\frac{3 \times 84 + 4 \times 70}{7}\). To assist with conjecturing and verifying the correct answer, I will write a Python script that enumerates candidate answers for this expression. Since the expression is straightforward, the script will compute the exact value and also explore nearby rational approximations, emphasizing correctness and efficient enumeration.

```python
# Enumerate possible exact values and close rational approximations for (3*84 + 4*70)/7
# Print each candidate answer immediately.

# Compute the exact value
exact_value = (3 * 84 + 4 * 70) / 7
print(exact_value)  # Exact rational number as float

# To explore rational approximations, consider numerator/denominator pairs with small denominators
# since the exact value is a rational number, we can find its simplified form
from fractions import Fraction

value_fraction = Fraction(3 * 84 + 4 * 70, 7).limit_denominator(100)
print(value_fraction)  # Exact rational approximation with small denominator

# Enumerate nearby fractions with denominators up to 100
for denom in range(1, 101):
    num = round(exact_value * denom)
    approx_frac = Fraction(num, denom).limit_denominator(100)
    # Only print if different from the exact value
    if approx_frac != value_fraction:
        print(approx_frac)
```
