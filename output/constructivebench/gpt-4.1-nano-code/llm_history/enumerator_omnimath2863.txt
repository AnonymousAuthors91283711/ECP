This appears to be a formalization in Lean involving a count of certain functions from a finite set to Bool, likely related to functions from a 3-element set (`Fin 3`) to `{true, false}`. The task is to find the total number of such functions, which is simply \(2^{|Fin 3|} = 2^3 = 8\).

Here's a Python program that enumerates all functions from a 3-element set to {True, False} and counts them, confirming the total is 8. It also prints each function for transparency.

```python
# Enumerate all functions from a 3-element set to {True, False}
# The set is represented as indices 0, 1, 2

functions = []
# Each function is represented as a list of 3 booleans
# There are 2^3 = 8 such functions
for bits in range(8):
    func = []
    for i in range(3):
        # Determine the output for position i
        val = (bits >> i) & 1
        func.append(bool(val))
    functions.append(func)
    # Print each function as a dictionary for clarity
    print(f"Function: {{0: {func[0]}, 1: {func[1]}, 2: {func[2]}}}")

# Confirm total count
print(f"Total functions: {len(functions)}")
```

This code efficiently enumerates all functions (total 8), prints each, and confirms the count matches expectations.
