Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a 4×4 matrix with specific properties:
   - Entries follow a calendar-like pattern: M i j = M 0 0 + j + 7*i
   - We create M' by reversing the 2nd and 4th rows (indices 1 and 3 in 0-based)
   - We calculate sums of main and anti-diagonals of M'
   - Finally, we take the absolute difference between these sums

2. The ground truth answer is 4, which is correct because:
   - The original matrix has main diagonal sum = 4*M00 + 0+7*0 + 1+7*1 + 2+7*2 + 3+7*3 = 4M00 + 84
   - After reversing rows 1 and 3, the main diagonal becomes M00, M13, M22, M31
   - The anti-diagonal becomes M03, M12, M21, M30
   - Calculating the difference gives exactly 4

3. The proposed answer is 0, which is incorrect because it suggests the sums would be equal after the row reversals, but they're not.
