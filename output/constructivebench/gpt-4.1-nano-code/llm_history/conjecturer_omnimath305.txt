abbrev omnimath305_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath305 (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) :
  IsSquare (2^n + 12^n + 2011^n) ↔ n ∈ omnimath305_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 1 yields a perfect square: 2025 = 45^2. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Based on the pattern and the given example, the only n that makes \(2^n + 12^n + 2011^n\) a perfect square is n = 1.
