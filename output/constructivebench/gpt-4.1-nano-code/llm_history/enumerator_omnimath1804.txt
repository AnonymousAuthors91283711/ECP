The problem involves counting the number of functions from `Fin 6 → Fin 6 → Bool` that can be expressed as the product of two Boolean functions, i.e., `f i j = (r i && c j)` for some `r, c : Fin 6 → Bool`.

Since `r` and `c` are functions from a finite set of size 6 to `Bool`, each can be chosen independently with 2 options per input, so:

- Number of possible `r` functions: \( 2^6 \).
- Number of possible `c` functions: \( 2^6 \).

For each such pair `(r, c)`, the function `f` is uniquely determined by `f i j = (r i && c j)`.

Therefore, the total count is \( 2^6 \times 2^6 = 2^{6+6} = 2^{12} = 4096 \).

```python
# Counts the number of functions f: Fin 6 → Fin 6 → Bool that can be written as f i j = (r i && c j)
# where r, c: Fin 6 → Bool.
# Since each of r and c is an arbitrary subset of size 6, with 2^6 options each,
# total functions = 2^6 * 2^6 = 2^{12} = 4096.
