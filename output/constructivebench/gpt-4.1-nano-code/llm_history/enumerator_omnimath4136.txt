[write_program]
You provided a Lean theorem involving conditions on integers \( x \) and \( y \). The core problem appears to be finding all integer pairs \((x, y)\) with \( x > 0 \) and \( y > 0 \) such that

\[
(x^2 y + x + y) \equiv 0 \pmod{(x y^2 + y + 7)}.
\]

To explore solutions systematically, I will write a Python program that iterates over small positive integers \( x \) and \( y \), tests the divisibility condition, and prints all pairs found. The focus is on small ranges to avoid excessive computation, and the program streams solutions as they are discovered.

```python
# Enumerate pairs of positive integers (x, y) up to given limits
# Check divisibility condition: (x^2 * y + x + y) % (x * y^2 + y + 7) == 0
# Print each solution immediately when found

max_x = 20  # upper limit for x
max_y = 20  # upper limit for y

for x in range(1, max_x + 1):
    for y in range(1, max_y + 1):
        numerator = x**2 * y + x + y
        denominator = x * y**2 + y + 7
        if numerator % denominator == 0:
            print(f"x={x}, y={y}, quotient={numerator // denominator}")
```
