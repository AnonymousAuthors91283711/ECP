The problem seems to be about characterizing functions \(f : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}\) satisfying a certain symmetric condition involving equal successive differences and an additive consistency condition. To assist in conjecturing, I will look for solutions that satisfy the given property, focusing on simple functions first.

Since the property involves equal differences and an additive relation, constant functions and affine functions are natural candidates to explore.

Here's a Python program that enumerates simple functions \(f : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}\) with small rational values (e.g., linear functions), checks the property on small sample points, and outputs those that satisfy the condition. It prioritizes functions with small parameters to keep exploration manageable.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate affine functions f(x) = a*x + b with small rational coefficients
# over small sample points used to test the condition.

# Define small sample rational coefficients
coefficients = [Fraction(i, j) for i in range(-3, 4) for j in range(1, 4) if i != 0 or j != 0]

# Sample points in rationals
sample_xs = [Fraction(n, 1) for n in range(0, 5)]  # 0,1,2,3,4
sample_constraints = []

# For simplicity, test a few functions with small parameters
for a in coefficients:
    for b in coefficients:
        def f(x):
            return a * x + b

        # Test the property on small random quadruples where inequalities hold
        # For simplicity, test on increasing sequences
        passes = True
        for x in sample_xs:
            for y in sample_xs:
                for z in sample_xs:
                    for t in sample_xs:
                        if x < y < z < t:
                            # Check if the equal differences hold
                            if (y - x == z - y == t - z):
                                # Check the functional equation
                                lhs = f(x) + f(t)
                                rhs = f(y) + f(z)
                                if lhs != rhs:
                                    passes = False
                                    break
                    if not passes:
                        break
                if not passes:
                    break
            if not passes:
                break
        if passes:
            print(f"f(x) = {a} * x + {b} satisfies the property on tested points")
```

This script searches for affine functions with small rational coefficients that satisfy the property at sampled points, helping identify candidate functions for the set \(\text{omnimath}_{3715}\). The output streams solutions as soon as they are found.
