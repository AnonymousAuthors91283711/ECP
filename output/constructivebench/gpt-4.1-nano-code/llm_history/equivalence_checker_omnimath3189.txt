noncomputable abbrev omnimath3189_answer : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3189 (L P M : ℝ) :
  (∃ N, M = L + (1/3) * (P - L) ∧ N = L + (2/3) * (P - L) ∧ 
   M - L = N - M ∧ N - M = P - N) ↔ M = omnimath3189_answer L P := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun L P => L + (1/3) * (P - L)
Proposed Answer: fun L P => (L + P) / 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a function omnimath3189_answer that satisfies the given theorem about points L, M, P being equally spaced (M is 1/3 from L and N is 2/3 from L).

2. Ground Truth Answer: fun L P => L + (1/3) * (P - L)
   - This clearly shows M is 1/3 of the way from L to P

3. Proposed Answer: fun L P => (L + P) / 3
   - Let's expand this: (L + P)/3 = (1/3)L + (1/3)P = L + (1/3)(P - L) - (2/3)L + (1/3)L
   - Wait, actually: (L + P)/3 = L/3 + P/3 = L - (2/3)L + (1/3)P = L + (1/3)(P - L)
   - So they are actually equivalent!

The proposed answer is algebraically equivalent to the ground truth answer, just written in a different form.
