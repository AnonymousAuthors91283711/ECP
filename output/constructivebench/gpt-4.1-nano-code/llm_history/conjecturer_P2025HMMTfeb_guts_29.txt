The current proposed answer tries to set the answer as a tuple ⟨a, b, c⟩ with equalities a = b = c = 0, which is syntactically incorrect in Lean because ⟨a, b, c⟩ constructs a tuple, but there is a comma after it and then a chain of equalities, which are not valid syntax. Also, the answer should be a single real number, not a tuple, as per the type abbreviation.

From the pattern in the problem, equations involve symmetric expressions with radicals and the given values suggest certain relationships among a, b, c, likely involving their absolute sizes or certain ratios.

Since the answer type is ℝ and the theorem's goal is to assert that a equals some algebraic expression, and from the problem structure, the most logical approach is to recognize that the solution for (a, b, c) might involve particular constants derived from the given fractions, possibly constants like 3/4, 5/12, 21/20, or some algebraic combination thereof.

Given the initial answer guess and the form of such symmetric radicals, a plausible simple candidate that matches the provided numerics and logic (and is typical for such problems involving radicals and ratios) is to set the answer as a constant real number, for example, 1, or an expression like 1/2.

However, the problem states "a = P2025HMMTfeb_guts_29_answer", suggesting the answer is a particular constant. Based on the symmetry and ratios, and the fact the formal answer is expected to be a real number, and for generality, the best closed-form candidate is:

<<<(3/4) * (5/12) * (21/20)>>>

which simplifies to a real number, and representing the approximate ratios involved.

Given the informal clue in the problem (fractions close to 1), the simplest speculation is that the answer is 1.

Hence, the correct way to define the answer in the code is:

- as a noncomputable constant numerical value, e.g., 1 or the algebraic product as above, and

- not as a tuple, and

- assigning directly to `P2025HMMTfeb_guts_29`.

Final answer:

<<<(3/4) * (5/12) * (21/20)>>>

This is a rational algebraic constant that might reflect the relationships within the problem, provided the context.

In conclusion, the main error is the improper attempt to assign a tuple with equalities in the answer definition. The fix involves defining a real number expression directly.
