candidate k = 0
Answer set (k values): [-10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0]. Expected Answer Type: Set ℤ
The pattern suggests all negative integers and zero satisfy the condition, as the divisibility fails for large n in an infinite set s. Non-negative integers likely do not satisfy it due to binomial coefficient divisibility properties. Therefore, the set includes all integers from -10 to 0, which extends to all ℤ ≤ 0.
