The problem appears to involve finding integer solutions (x, y) to the equation: (2x + 1)^3 + 1 = y^4, and determining whether such solutions exist. To assist in conjecturing, we can enumerate small integer pairs (x, y) where -10 ≤ x, y ≤ 10, and check whether the equation holds. We focus on small values first to identify solutions or patterns.

```python
# Enumerate small integer pairs (x, y) within a reasonable range
# Check whether (2x + 1)^3 + 1 == y^4
for x in range(-10, 11):
    lhs = (2 * x + 1) ** 3 + 1
    for y in range(-10, 11):
        rhs = y ** 4
        if lhs == rhs:
            print(f"Solution found: x={x}, y={y}")
```
