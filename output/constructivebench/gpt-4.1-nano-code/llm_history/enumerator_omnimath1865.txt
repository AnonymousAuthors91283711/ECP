This problem involves exploring the sum over natural numbers n with certain conditions involving square roots, and an expression involving m=9√n + 4√(n+2) - 3√(n+16). The sum is over all n where 0< n and m is an integer (m = 9√n + 4√(n+2) - 3√(n+16)).

To assist in understanding, we will:
- Enumerate small n (say n from 1 to 100) to check when that expression yields an integer m.
- For each n, compute m; if m is integral, print n and m.
- This computational approach helps conjecture the pattern or solutions.

Here's the program in Python:

```python
import math

# Define the range for n
max_n = 100

# Enumerate n from 1 to max_n
for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    # Calculate the expression
    val = 9 * math.sqrt(n) + 4 * math.sqrt(n + 2) - 3 * math.sqrt(n + 16)
    
    # Check if val is close to an integer
    m = round(val)
    if abs(val - m) < 1e-9:
        # Verify that m is indeed an integer
        if abs(val - m) < 1e-12:
            print(f"n = {n}, m = {m}")
```
