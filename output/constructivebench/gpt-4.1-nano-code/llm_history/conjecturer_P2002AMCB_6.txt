The roots satisfy the quadratic equation with coefficients `C a` and `C b`, where the quadratic roots are `a` and `b` themselves, so the polynomial factors as `(X - a)(X - b)`. The relation implies `a` and `b` are roots of `X^2 + C a X + C b`, hence the quadratic factors as `(X - a)(X - b) = X^2 - (a + b) X + a b`, matching coefficients with the quadratic. Equating coefficients gives `C a = - (a + b)` and `C b = a b`. The candidate `(1, -2)` satisfies these relations: with `a=1`, `b=-2`, then `C a = - (1 + (-2)) = - (-1) = 1` and `C b = 1 * (-2) = -2` which matches the given.

The error in Lean arises because `set.univ { (a, b) | a = 1 ∧ b = -2 }` is invalid. The correct way to define a set with exactly one element `(1, -2)` is simply `{ (1, -2) }`, which Lean interprets as a singleton set. Moreover, since the problem's enumerated candidate is `(1, -2)`, and the logical equivalence involves these `(a, b)` satisfying the quadratic equations, the final answer should be the singleton set containing `(1, -2)`.

Hence, the fixed answer should be:

<<<{ (1, -2) }>>>

This aligns with the candidate pair and the nature of a singleton solution set meeting the initial conditions in the problem.
