The solution involves solving the polynomial equation \((2x+1)(3x+1)(5x+1)(30x+1)=10\). Each factor introduces potential rational solutions, likely roots of the polynomial. Based on the pattern and factor structure, the solutions should be the roots of the polynomial obtained by expanding the product and solving for \(x\). These roots are rational numbers with small denominators (such as \(-\frac{1}{2}\), \(-\frac{1}{3}\), etc.), and the pattern suggests the roots are explicit rational values. Therefore, the set contains these solutions.
