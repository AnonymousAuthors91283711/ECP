Ground Truth Answer: 27
Proposed Answer: 6
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a natural number n where:
   - n is not prime
   - n-2 is not prime
   - This number should serve as a counterexample to the statement "for all non-prime n, n-2 is prime"

2. Ground truth answer is 27:
   - 27 is not prime (3×9)
   - 27-2 = 25 is not prime (5×5)
   - This correctly satisfies all conditions

3. Proposed answer is 6:
   - 6 is not prime (2×3)
   - 6-2 = 4 is not prime (2×2)
   - This also satisfies all conditions

Both 6 and 27 satisfy the required conditions, so they are both valid answers to the problem. The problem doesn't specify that the answer needs to be unique or the smallest possible counterexample.
