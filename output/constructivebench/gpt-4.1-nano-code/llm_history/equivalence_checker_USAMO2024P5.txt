theorem USAMO2024P5 (k : ℕ) :
  (∀ (n : ℕ), 0 < n → (∑ i in Finset.range (n + 1), (Nat.choose n i)^k) % (n + 1) = 0) ↔ k ∈ USAMO2024P5_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {k | Even k}
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n % 2 = 0
Let me analyze this:

1. The problem is about finding all natural numbers k where a certain binomial sum condition holds modulo (n+1).

2. The ground truth answer states that the solution is all even numbers k (i.e., k where k % 2 = 0).

3. The proposed answer is a function that checks if n is even (n % 2 = 0).

The key difference:
- The ground truth is about the parameter k being even
- The proposed answer is about n being even (which is the variable in the sum, not the exponent)

These are not equivalent because:
1. They're talking about different variables (k vs n)
2. The condition applies to different aspects of the problem
