This problem appears to involve finding a prime P2015AIMEI_3_answer such that 16 * P + 1 = n^3 for some positive integer n. To solve it, we'll search for prime P in a small range, and check if 16P + 1 is a perfect cube. We'll print all candidates where this condition holds, focusing on small values to keep it simple and efficient.

```python
# Enumerate small prime candidates for P and check if 16*P +1 is a perfect cube.
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def is_perfect_cube(x):
    c = round(x ** (1/3))
    return c ** 3 == x

# Define search range for P, e.g., first 100 primes
primes = []
candidate = 2
while len(primes) < 100:
    if is_prime(candidate):
        primes.append(candidate)
    candidate += 1

for P in primes:
    val = 16 * P + 1
    if is_perfect_cube(val):
        n = round(val ** (1/3))
        print(f"Prime P: {P}, 16*P+1: {val} = {n}^3")
```
