  IsGreatest {k : ℕ | ∃ (a : ℕ), 0 < a ∧ ∀ n ∈ Icc 1 k, Nat.Prime (2^(x a n) - 1)} olympiadbench1631_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Maximum sequence length: n=2 for a=2
a=2, n=1, x=2, 2^2-1=3 (prime=True)
a=2, n=2, x=5, 2^5-1=31 (prime=True). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sequence x a n is defined by doubling and adding one, starting from a, with interest in 2^{x a n} - 1 being prime. From enumerations, for a=2, sequence length n=2, the prime values are 3 and 31. To maximize sequence length with initial a, optimal is a=2, resulting in the sequence's maximum length n=2. So the answer should reflect this maximum sequence length for the optimal initial value.
