The problem appears to involve finding an answer related to a constructed number \(N\) based on a parameter \(T\), which affects the minimal number \(minNum\). The key aspect is the construction of \(N\) as the smallest \(T\)-digit number divisible by 33. Then, the expression involves the last two digits of \(N\).

To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will write a Python script that:

- Enumerates possible minimal \(T\)-digit numbers, starting from \(10^{T-1}\).
- Finds the smallest such number divisible by 33.
- Computes the product of its last two digits.
- Streams each answer, especially for small values of \(T\), since \(T\) influences the number of digits.

This approach will avoid over-computation and focus on small \(T\) values to reveal patterns.

```python
# Enumerate minimal T-digit number divisible by 33:
# For each T from 1 to 6 (small sample), compute minimal T-digit number
# Find the first number >= 10^(T-1) divisible by 33
# Extract last two digits and compute their product
# Stream results for each T

def find_min_num(T):
    min_num = 10**(T - 1)
    remainder = min_num % 33
    if remainder == 0:
        N = min_num
    else:
        N = min_num + (33 - remainder)
    return N

for T in range(1, 7):
    N = find_min_num(T)
    last_two_digits = N % 100
    digit1 = last_two_digits // 10
    digit2 = last_two_digits % 10
    product = digit1 * digit2
    print(f"T={T}, N={N}, last two digits=({digit1},{digit2}), product={product}")
```
