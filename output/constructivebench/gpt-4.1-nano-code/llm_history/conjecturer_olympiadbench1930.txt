. Enumerated answers: Solution: a=1, b=2, c=3
Solution: a=1, b=3, c=2
Solution: a=2, b=1, c=3
Solution: a=2, b=3, c=1
Solution: a=3, b=1, c=2
Solution: a=3, b=2, c=1. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)
The pattern indicates all permutations of (1, 2, 3). Since the variables are symmetric and all are positive, and based on the solutions' enumeration, the only solutions are permutations of this triplet.  
Final answer: <<< {(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1)} >>>
