open Nat

noncomputable abbrev omnimath2309_answer : ℕ → ℕ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2309 (x y : ℕ) (hx : x ≤ 5) (hy : y ≤ 5) :
  let total_paths := Nat.choose 10 5
  let blocked_paths := Nat.choose (x + y) x * Nat.choose (10 - x - y) (5 - x)
  (total_paths - blocked_paths : ℝ) / 36 = omnimath2309_answer x y := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => (Nat.choose 10 5 - Nat.choose (x + y) x * Nat.choose (10 - x - y) (5 - x)) / 36
Proposed Answer: fun x y => (0.16666666666666666 : ℝ) * (x - 1) + (0.8333333333333334 : ℝ) * y + 6
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
1. This is a combinatorics problem involving counting paths with certain constraints
2. The ground truth answer calculates the probability by:
   - Total paths: choose(10,5)
   - Blocked paths: choose(x+y,x)*choose(10-x-y,5-x)
   - Then takes (total-blocked)/36

Proposed Answer Analysis:
1. The proposed answer is a linear function of x and y
2. It doesn't involve any combinatorial calculations
3. The coefficients appear arbitrary (0.166..., 0.833...)

Comparison:
- The proposed answer is completely different in form and approach from the ground truth
- There's no obvious mathematical equivalence between the combinatorial calculation and the linear function
- The proposed answer doesn't account for the constraints (x ≤ 5, y ≤ 5) or the combinatorial nature of the problem

Conclusion: The answers are not equivalent.
