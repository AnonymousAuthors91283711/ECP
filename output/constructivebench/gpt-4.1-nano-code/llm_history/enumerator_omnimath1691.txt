The problem involves finding the number of integers \(b\) such that there exists a polynomial \(f\) with integer coefficients satisfying \(f(2) = 2010\) and \(f(b) = 8\). We need to enumerate candidates for \(b\) and check the existence of such polynomials, which relates to the divisibility and factorization properties of the polynomial form.

Approach:
- Fix a candidate \(b\).
- Attempt to construct \(f\) explicitly or analyze the difference \(f(b) - f(2) = 8 - 2010 = -2002\).
- Using polynomial interpolation, for any degree \(d\), the values at points 2 and \(b\) determine \(f\). 
- Since \(f\) has integer coefficients, the difference \(f(b) - f(2) = -2002\) must relate to differences in polynomial evaluations, which often means divisibility considerations of the interpolation coefficients.

Given the problem's structure and constraints, we will:
- Enumerate possible integer \(b\) values within a small range.
- For each, check if an integer polynomial \(f\) can be constructed, primarily focusing on the linear case for simplicity and efficiency.
- Count the total solutions.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate integer b within a manageable range
# For simplicity, consider b in [-100, 100]
# For each b, check if an integer polynomial f exists with f(2)=2010, f(b)=8
# For linear polynomials: f(x) = m*x + c
# Solve for m and c:
# 2010 = m*2 + c
# 8 = m*b + c
# Subtract:
# 8 - 2010 = m*(b - 2)
# m = -2002 / (b - 2)
# c = 2010 - 2m
# Check if m is integer; if yes, then c is integer?

answers = []
for b in range(-100, 101):
    denom = b - 2
    if denom != 0 and -2002 % denom == 0:
        m = -2002 // denom
        c = 2010 - 2 * m
        if isinstance(m, int) and isinstance(c, int):
            answers.append(b)
            print(b)

# Output the total count
print("Number of solutions:", len(answers))
```

This code efficiently enumerates candidate \(b\) values where a linear polynomial exists satisfying the conditions, streaming answers directly as they are found.
