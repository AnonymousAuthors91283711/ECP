Ground Truth Answer: -50
Proposed Answer: 67
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for an integer k (olympiadbench2791_answer) such that the polynomial X⁴ + kX² + mX + 225 can be factored into four distinct linear terms in arithmetic progression (with common difference 2d).

2. The roots are given as (a-3d), (a-d), (a+d), (a+3d), which form an arithmetic progression with step 2d.

3. For such a polynomial, Vieta's formulas tell us:
   - Sum of roots = 0 (coefficient of X³ is 0)
   - Sum of product of roots two at a time = k
   - Sum of product of roots three at a time = -m
   - Product of roots = 225

4. Calculating the sum of roots: (a-3d) + (a-d) + (a+d) + (a+3d) = 4a = 0 ⇒ a = 0

5. Now the polynomial simplifies to (X² - 9d²)(X² - d²) = X⁴ - 10d²X² + 9d⁴

6. Comparing with given form X⁴ + kX² + 225, we get:
   - 9d⁴ = 225 ⇒ d² = 5 ⇒ d = ±√5
   - k = -10d² = -50

The ground truth answer (-50) matches this calculation, while the proposed answer (67) does not.
