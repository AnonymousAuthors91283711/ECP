abbrev P2011AMCA_4_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2011AMCA_4 :
  let third := 4
  let fourth := 2
  let fifth := 1
  (third * 12 + fourth * 15 + fifth * 10) / (third + fourth + fifth) = P2011AMCA_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Exact average as fraction: 88/37
Decimal approximation: 2.3783783783783785. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The average is \(\frac{88}{37}\); pattern indicates the answer should be that fraction.  
Final answer: <<<88/37>>>
