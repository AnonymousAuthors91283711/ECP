abbrev P2021AMCB_4_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2021AMCB_4 : 
  (3 * 84 + 4 * 70) / 7 = P2021AMCB_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 76.0
76. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The given expression simplifies algebraically: (3*84 + 4*70)/7 = (252 + 280)/7 = 532/7 = 76. 

Since the enumerated answer is 76.0, the value as a rational number is 76.
