To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest prime \( p \) such that \( p \) divides \( 101101101101 \), and \( p \) is between 1000 and 9999. 

The approach:
- Factor \( 101101101101 \) to find its prime divisors.
- Check which prime divisors are within the bounds.
- Enumerate the factors, then select the largest prime in the specified range.

Since the full factorization might be extensive, we'll focus on finding prime factors between 1000 and 9999 by testing candidate divisors efficiently.

```python
# Program to find the greatest prime divisor of 101101101101 within [1000, 9999]
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return n == 2
    sqrt_n = int(math.isqrt(n))
    for i in range(3, sqrt_n + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

TARGET = 101101101101
lower_bound = 1000
upper_bound = 9999
max_prime_factor = 0

# To save computations, test factors by dividing TARGET with potential primes
# For efficiency, generate candidate primes around the upper bound downward
for candidate in range(upper_bound, lower_bound - 1, -1):
    if is_prime(candidate):
        if TARGET % candidate == 0:
            max_prime_factor = candidate
            print(candidate)  # stream the prime factor found
            break  # since we go downward, first match is the greatest

# Output the greatest prime factor
print("Greatest prime divisor in range:", max_prime_factor)
```
