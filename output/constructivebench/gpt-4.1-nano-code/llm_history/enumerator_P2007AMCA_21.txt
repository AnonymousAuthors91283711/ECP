The problem appears to involve a quadratic polynomial \( f(X) = aX^2 + bX + c \) with complex coefficients and how its zeros relate to the coefficients. The conditions given relate the sum and product of roots to coefficients, and there's a specific focus on the sum of zeros, the product of zeros, and the sum of coefficients. We see the classical relationships:

- sum of zeros = \(-b/a\)
- product of zeros = \(c/a\)

The theorem suggests that under certain conditions, the sum of the zeros equals some function \( P2007AMCA_21_answer a b c \), which is unspecified (`sorry`) in the formal Lean proof. The goal in this context appears to be to enumerate possible answers or to find particular values of \( a, b, c \) satisfying the relations.

Since the question is about enumerating plausible answers, and the problem involves complex coefficients, I will write a Python script that:

- Selects small sample values for \(a, b, c\),
- Ensures \(a \neq 0\),
- Calculates the sum of roots, product of roots, and sum of coefficients,
- Checks the relations,
- Prints possible values for \( P2007AMCA_21_answer a b c \) based on the relation between the roots.

This way, the code can explore solutions that could guide understanding.

```python
# Enumerate small complex coefficient tuples satisfying the relations
# For simplicity, restrict to small integers and known relationships
# Here, we assume P2007AMCA_21_answer is related to the sum of roots
# For demonstration, output the sum of roots when conditions hold

def enumerate_answers(max_value=3):
    for a in range(1, max_value+1):  # a != 0
        for b in range(-max_value, max_value+1):
            for c in range(-max_value, max_value+1):
                sum_zeros = -b / a
                prod_zeros = c / a
                sum_coeffs = a + b + c
                # Check the equalities a) sum_zeros = prod_zeros, b) prod_zeros = sum_coeffs, c) sum_coeffs = sum_zeros
                if abs(sum_zeros - prod_zeros) < 1e-6 and abs(prod_zeros - sum_coeffs) < 1e-6:
                    # All three are equal
                    answer = sum_zeros
                    print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c} => roots_sum={sum_zeros}, roots_prod={prod_zeros}, sum_coeffs={sum_coeffs}")
                    # Here, assume P2007AMCA_21_answer returns the sum of roots in such cases
                    print(f"P2007AMCA_21_answer = {answer}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_answers()
```
