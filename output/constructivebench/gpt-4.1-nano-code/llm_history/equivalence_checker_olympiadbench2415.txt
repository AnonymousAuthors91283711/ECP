Ground Truth Answer: fun x => (x - 1) * (x - 2) / 6
Proposed Answer: fun m => (m - 4) * (m - 3) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

The problem is asking for a function f(m) where the floor of f(m) equals the sum of floor(k/3) for k from 1 to m-1, when m > 4.

The ground truth answer is f(x) = (x-1)(x-2)/6
The proposed answer is f(m) = (m-4)(m-3)/2

Let's test with m=5:
- Ground truth: (5-1)(5-2)/6 = 4*3/6 = 2
- Proposed: (5-4)(5-3)/2 = 1*2/2 = 1
- Actual sum: floor(1/3)+floor(2/3)+floor(3/3)+floor(4/3) = 0+0+1+1 = 2

The ground truth matches (floor(2)=2), but the proposed doesn't (floor(1)=1≠2).

Let's try m=6:
- Ground truth: (6-1)(6-2)/6 = 5*4/6 ≈ 3.333 (floor=3)
- Proposed: (6-4)(6-3)/2 = 2*3/2 = 3
- Actual sum: previous 2 + floor(5/3) = 2+1 = 3

Here both match, but this is coincidental.

m=7:
- Ground truth: (7-1)(7-2)/6 = 6*5/6 = 5
- Proposed: (7-4)(7-3)/2 = 3*4/2 = 6
- Actual sum: previous 3 + floor(6/3) = 3+2 = 5

Again ground truth matches (5), proposed doesn't (floor(6)=6≠5).

The proposed answer is incorrect for most cases, though it happens to work for m=6.
