Ground Truth Answer: {1, -1, 7, -7}
Proposed Answer: { x | ∃ n : ℤ, x = 2 * n + 1 ∨ x = - (2 * n + 1) }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all real numbers m that satisfy either of two systems of equations involving n.

2. The ground truth answer {1, -1, 7, -7} gives specific solutions that satisfy the equations.

3. The proposed answer { x | ∃ n : ℤ, x = 2 * n + 1 ∨ x = - (2 * n + 1) } describes all odd integers (positive and negative).

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It includes all odd integers, while only specific odd integers (1, -1, 7, -7) satisfy the original equations
- For example, x=3 would be in the proposed set but doesn't satisfy either system of equations
- The ground truth shows only four specific solutions work
