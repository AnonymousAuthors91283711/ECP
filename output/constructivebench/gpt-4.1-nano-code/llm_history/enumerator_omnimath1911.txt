This problem involves combinatorics and set enumeration within a specific finite context, involving symmetric groups related to finite sets. To explore the possible values of \( A - B \), I will enumerate all relevant elements explicitly for small sets \( S \) (from 1 to 6), then compute the cardinalities \(A\) and \(B\).

- \(S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\)
- \(A = \text{card}(\text{Sym}^2(S))\), where \(\text{Sym}^2(S)\) are the pairs \(\{(x,y) \mid x \neq y, x,y \in S\}\)
- \(B = \text{card}(\text{Sym}^2(S) \times \text{Sym}^2(S))\)

The goal is to compute \(A - B\) for this small set. Since the problem involves symmetric groups and pairs, I'll enumerate the structures explicitly and print partial results as I go.

```python
# Python code to enumerate possible values of A - B for set S = {1,2,3,4,5,6}

# Define the set S
S = list(range(1, 7))

# Generate all ordered pairs (x, y) with x != y
pairs = [(x, y) for x in S for y in S if x != y]

A = len(pairs)  # number of pairs (since symmetric, these are ordered pairs with x != y)

# For B, consider all pairs ((x,y), (u,v)) where both are in pairs
# Each is from pairs, so total B is len(pairs)^2, but as the input involves Sym2 S, which likely refers to unordered pairs
# Since Sym2 S typically denotes unordered pairs with x != y, we confirm pairs are unordered

# Generate unordered pairs (x,y) with x < y to avoid duplicates
unordered_pairs = [(x, y) for x in S for y in S if x < y]
B = len(unordered_pairs) ** 2

# Compute difference
difference = A - B

# Print results
print(f"S = {S}")
print(f"Number of ordered pairs (x != y): {A}")
print(f"Number of unordered pairs (x < y): {len(unordered_pairs)}")
print(f"B (square of unordered pairs): {B}")
print(f"Difference A - B: {difference}")

# Return the computed value
omnimath1911_answer = difference
```

This code enumerates all relevant elements for the specified small set, computes the values \(A\) and \(B\), and outputs their difference. Given the set size, this straightforward approach maximizes understandability and efficiency without hardcoding, and it streams partial results immediately when run.
