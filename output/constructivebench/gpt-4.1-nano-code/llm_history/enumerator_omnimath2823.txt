The problem involves computing the value of (5 - 2) / (2 + 1). To assist in conjecturing and confirming the answer, the program should enumerate simple rational candidates and verify the exact value. Since the calculation is straightforward, the code will directly compute and print the exact answer as a rational number, ensuring the streaming of results.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Calculate the exact value of (5 - 2) / (2 + 1)
answer = Fraction(5 - 2, 2 + 1)

# Output the answer immediately
print(answer)
```
