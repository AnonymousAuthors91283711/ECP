Given the problem involves summing digits of specific numbers generated from a pattern and the unknown answer, I'll write a Python script that enumerates all values for n in range 111, computes 9*(k+1) for each, and sums their digits.

This approach provides concrete candidate sums, which could help in formulating a conjecture or checking patterns.

```python
# Enumerate n from 0 to 110
# For each n, compute 9 * (n + 1)
# Sum the digits of each computed number
# Print each sum to observe possible patterns

def sum_of_digits(num):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(num))

for k in range(111):
    n = 9 * (k + 1)
    digits_sum = sum_of_digits(n)
    print(digits_sum)
```
