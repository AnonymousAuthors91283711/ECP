(5, 5). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
Based on the pattern, the solutions are symmetric pairs around 3, with (2,2) (2,4), (3,3), (3,5), (4,2), (4,4), (5,3), (5,5). These fit the pattern m = n, or when m and n are consecutive. The set includes pairs with a difference of at most 1, symmetric around 3.
