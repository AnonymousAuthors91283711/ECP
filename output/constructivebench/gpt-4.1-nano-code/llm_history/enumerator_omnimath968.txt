This problem is about finding the greatest possible value of the coordinate "round" such that certain digit conditions are satisfied. The constraints are:

- h, g, r are non-zero digits
- The list being pairwise distinct
- The numbers h m t, g u t s, and r o u n d are formed from those digits
- h m t and g u t s sum to "round"
- r = 1

The key is to generate candidate digits for h, m, t, g, u, s, o, n, d, r, with the necessary constraints, and evaluate possible "round" values, then output the maximum among them.

Here's the plan:

- Loop over possible digits (1-9 for non-zero digits, 0-9 for others)
- For each valid combination, construct the numbers
- Check the sum condition
- Track the maximum "round" value encountered

Note: To maximize efficiency, we break early when possible, and only check relevant combinations. Given it's small, brute-force over all choices is feasible.

```python
# Enumerate all valid digit combinations respecting constraints,
# and find the maximum "round" value satisfying the conditions.

max_round = 0
# h, g, r are non-zero
for h in range(1, 10):
    for g in range(1, 10):
        for r in range(1, 10):
            # m, t, u, s, o, n, d can be 0-9, excluding those already used
            used = {h, g, r}
            # Iterate over possible digits for the other positions
            for m in range(10):
                if m in used:
                    continue
                for t in range(10):
