Your problem involves finding a sorted list of real numbers whose set is exactly {3, 5/2, âˆš10}. The goal is to generate all possible ordered lists (with the given set elements) and verify those that are sorted, then output each candidate immediately. Since there are 3 distinct elements, the permutations are manageable.

Here's a Python script that enumerates all permutations of the set {3, 1.25, sqrt(10)} and prints those that are sorted, implying the list is in non-decreasing order and matches the set as its elements. This matches the problem's constraints and ensures efficient, streaming output.

```python
import math
import itertools

# Define the set elements explicitly
set_elements = [3, 1.25, math.sqrt(10)]

# Generate all permutations of the set elements
for perm in itertools.permutations(set_elements):
    # Check if the permutation is sorted (non-decreasing)
    if all(perm[i] <= perm[i+1] for i in range(len(perm)-1)):
        # Check if the multiset matches the original set (order may differ)
        if sorted(perm) == sorted(set_elements):
            print(perm)
```
