The problem appears to involve two natural numbers a and b, with constraints on a: 10 â‰¤ a < 100, and an expression involving a transformation of a leading to a 2-digit number `(n % 10) * 10 + n / 10`. The goal seems to find all possible pairs (a, b) such that some transformed form of a times b equals 161, and the value of a * b is stored in `P2011AMCB_4_answer`.

Given the parametric nature and the modular expression, I'll write a Python script to enumerate all a in [10,99], see all b that satisfy the condition `(lambda n: (n % 10) * 10 + n // 10) a * b = 161`, and determine possible answers.

We prioritize exact matches and print each candidate as soon as found.

```python
# Enumerate all a in [10, 99], compute transformed value, then find b such that
# transformed(a) * b == 161. Print all valid (a, b) pairs immediately.
# Finally, determine the maximum value of a * b among candidates.

for a in range(10, 100):
    transformed = (a % 10) * 10 + (a // 10)
    if transformed == 0:
        continue  # avoid division by zero or invalid b
    if 161 % transformed == 0:
        b = 161 // transformed
        if 10 <= b:
            product = a * b
            print(f"a={a}, transformed={transformed}, b={b}, a*b={product}")
            # Store candidate answers for final maximum
            # But since we only do printing here, just keep track externally if needed
```
