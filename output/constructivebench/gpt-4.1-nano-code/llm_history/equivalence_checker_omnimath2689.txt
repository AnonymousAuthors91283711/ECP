abbrev omnimath2689_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2689 (wednesdayPoints fridayPoints : ℕ) :
    fridayPoints = wednesdayPoints * 80 / 100 ↔ fridayPoints = omnimath2689_answer wednesdayPoints := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun wednesdayPoints => wednesdayPoints * 80 / 100
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n / 2
