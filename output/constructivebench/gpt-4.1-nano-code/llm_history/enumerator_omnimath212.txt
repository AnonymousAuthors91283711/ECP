[write_program]
This problem appears to be a functional equation involving real-valued functions and polynomial or algebraic manipulations. To assist in conjecturing solutions, I will write a Python program that searches for functions fitting the given equation by testing simple functions and the behavior of particular values over small ranges.

Since the equation involves polynomials and the functional form is complicated, I will focus on constant functions, linear functions, and quadratic functions over small domains. For each candidate, I'll check the functional equation for several sample points. The program will print solutions that satisfy the equation over these samples, which can help in forming a conjecture.

```python
import math

# Define a list of candidate functions to test
def constant_func(c):
    return lambda x: c

def linear_func(a, b):
    return lambda x: a * x + b

# Sample points for testing
sample_points = [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0]

# Tolerance for floating point comparison
eps = 1e-6

# Store discovered solutions for printing
solutions = []

# Test constant functions
for c in [-10, -5, 0, 5, 10]:
    f = constant_func(c)
    valid = True
    for x in sample_points:
        for y in sample_points:
            lhs = f(x**2 - y) + 2 * y * f(x)
            rhs = f(f(x)) + f(y)
            if abs(lhs - rhs) > eps:
                valid = False
                break
        if not valid:
            break
    if valid:
        solutions.append(('constant', c))
        print(f"Constant solution: f(x) = {c}")

# Test linear functions
for a in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    for b in [-5, 0, 5]:
        f = linear_func(a, b)
        valid = True
        for x in sample_points:
            for y in sample_points:
                lhs = f(x**2 - y) + 2 * y * f(x)
                rhs = f(f(x)) + f(y)
                if abs(lhs - rhs) > eps:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            solutions.append(('linear', a, b))
            print(f"Linear solution: f(x) = {a}x + {b}")

# Summarize candidate solutions found
print("Candidates satisfying the equation over sampled points:")
for sol in solutions:
    print(sol)
```
