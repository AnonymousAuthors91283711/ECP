The problem relates to finding the value of `h` based on given conditions involving pairs of natural numbers and quadratic equations. Given the specific parameters `j=2013` and `k=2014`, we need to explore these equations:

1. For `x1`, `x2`: both satisfy `3*(x - h)^2 + j = 0`, with distinct positive integers `x1` and `x2`.
2. For `x3`, `x4`: both satisfy `2*(x - h)^2 + k = 0`, with distinct positive integers `x3` and `x4`.

Since these are quadratic equations set to zero, the expressions inside should be non-positive (because perfect squares are non-negative). For each, derive possible `(x - h)^2` values:

- For `3*(x - h)^2 + 2013 = 0`:
  `3*(x - h)^2 = -2013` --> no real solutions (since LHS ≥ 0, RHS < 0). But considering the possibility of an error or for a conceptual purpose, perhaps the equations are intended to find that the sum equals zero, leading to specific `(x - h)` values for *integer* solutions.

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem's essence is to find `h` such that these pairs of natural numbers satisfy the quadratic equations with the same parameter.

Given the structure, the only way for the quadratic equations to hold with positive integers is when the expression `(x - h)^2` matches specific values derived from the parameters `j` and `k`.

Because no real solutions exist with positive `j` and `k` in this case (since `3*(x - h)^2 + 2013 = 0` implies negative value), likely the problem involves a different consideration: perhaps the key is the differences in `x` and their squares, or in the sum of solutions for specific `h` values.

**Solution approach**:
- Since the equations involve perfect squares, try to find possible `(x - h)^2` values that satisfy the equations without contradiction by considering only the allowable integer solutions.
- Given the constraints `j=2013` and `k=2014`, explore possible small integer values `x` that satisfy the equations for various `h`, focusing on the differences.

This iteration suggests examining small integer values of `x` with `h` near those, testing whether the quadratic expression equals zero, and deriving the consistent `h`.

```python
# Since the equations are quadratic in (x - h),
# and for the quadratic to equal zero, the expression must be non-negative.
# Because the equations are of the form:
# 3*(x - h)^2 + 2013 = 0 and 2*(x - h)^2 + 2014 = 0,
# these cannot be satisfied with real integer solutions directly.
# Possibly, the problem is about the distribution of x's for which the expressions are zero
# in some interpreted sense (e.g., considering the equations as equalities and the solutions as roots).
# Instead, check for possible solutions where:
# 3*(x - h)^2 + 2013 = 0 => (x - h)^2 = -2013/3 = -671,
# which is impossible for real x. Similarly for the second.
# Maybe the problem subsumes approximate or conceptual solutions.
# Alternatively, find integer pairs (x1,x2) with x1 ≠ x2, both positive, satisfying:
# 3*(x_i - h)^2 + 2013 = 0 -> discard
# or finding (x - h)^2 = some integer, satisfying the equations under different conditions.

# Given the above, perhaps we should focus on the differences:
# Let's iterate over small positive x's to find if any (x - h)^2 yields integer solutions.

# Since the equations cannot be exactly zero for positive 2013 and 2014,
# set to find integer (x - h)^2 values close to the negative RHS divided by the coefficient.

# Implement a small search to test candidate h values and x's:
for h in range(0, 50):
    for x1 in range(1, 50):
        val1 = 3*(x1 - h)**2 + 2013
        if val1 == 0:
            for x2 in range(1, 50):
                if x2 != x1:
                    val2 = 3*(x2 - h)**2 + 2013
                    if val2 == 0:
                        # Found candidate h with x1, x2
                        print(f"h = {h}, x1 = {x1}, x2 = {x2}, satisfies first equation")
    for x3 in range(1, 50):
        val3 = 2*(x3 - h)**2 + 2014
        if val3 == 0:
            for x4 in range(1, 50):
                if x4 != x3:
                    val4 = 2*(x4 - h)**2 + 2014
                    if val4 == 0:
                        print(f"h = {h}, x3 = {x3}, x4 = {x4}, satisfies second equation")
```

This code searches for small integer solutions of the equations given the parameters, directly attempting to find `h` that makes the expressions zero with positive integers `x`. It streams outputs immediately whenever solutions are found, assisting in forming conjectures about `h`.  
The problem is constructed for exploration; the precise solution depends on actual integer values satisfying these equations, if any exist.
[refine_program]
The problem discusses equations with positive parameters but reveals that the equations of the form:

- 3*(x - h)^2 + 2013 = 0  
- 2*(x - h)^2 + 2014 = 0

are impossible to satisfy with real x, because the left sides are always ≥ 2013 and 2014, respectively, which are positive. So, the equations cannot have real solutions unless considering approximate or conceptual points. The code provided searches for integer solutions with zero evaluations, which is impossible in reality given the constants.

Since the code outputs nothing (as expected), this suggests either the problem is about some limit, approximate solutions, or about the parameters h, x1, x2, x3, x4 satisfying the constraints in some other manner.

**Judgment:**
- The code searches for integer solutions where the equations are exactly zero, but such solutions cannot exist.
- Since the problem hints at possible solutions and uses "sorry," an indication that the explicit answer is not computed, the code should instead attempt a small parameter search for approximate or boundary cases, or process the constants directly.
- Given the code outputs nothing, I conclude the original program should be rejected. To accept it as a correct enumeration, it should at least output the candidate parameters (even if none are found), meaning the code should be prepared to display these approximate solutions, or at minimum, the answer should be specified properly.

**Decision:**
<<<False>>>

**Corrected Solution:**

Because the equations cannot be exactly zero with the given constants, and checking for the theoretical solution, the key is to realize that the equations:

- 3*(x - h)^2 = -2013
- 2*(x - h)^2 = -2014

are impossible for real x, unless we allow complex solutions. But since the problem appears to only consider positive integers, the points are invalid.

However, given the problem context and the code snippet, the key is to identify that the solutions do not exist in reals, and thus, the problem possibly wants to determine `h` such that the minimal absolute value of the expressions is achieved.

Alternatively, since the equations cannot be zero, perhaps the answer (the value of `h`) corresponds to the point minimizing the maximum of the two expressions, or other criteria.

Given the original some constants, and the equations not solvable exactly, the minimal value of the larger of the two expressions occurs
[refine_program]
The provided code is a formal Lean theorem statement that includes the problem setup and some properties with unknown answer placeholder `P2014AIMEI_6_answer`. The code itself does not contain any implementation or search logic, and the "Program" section is empty, resulting in no enumeration or any output.

Since the task is to write a Python program that enumerates potential answers consistent with the problem constraints, outputs answers immediately when found, and handles parameters and optimization as specified, the current code is not acceptable. It is not executable, and it provides no enumeration, so it should be rejected.

**Verdict:** <<<False>>>

### Corrected Python Program:

Below is a Python script that attempts to find the value of `h` satisfying the given constraints, based on the problem's structure:

```python
# This program searches for h given the constraints:
# 1. 0 < h
# 2. There exist two distinct natural numbers x1, x2 > 0 such that:
#    3*(x1 - h)^2 + j = 0
#    3*(x2 - h)^2 + j = 0
# 3. There exist two distinct natural numbers x3, x4 > 0 such that:
#    2*(x3 - h)^2 + k = 0
#    2*(x4 - h)^2 + k = 0
# With j = 2013 and k = 2014

# Approach:
# Since the equations imply (x - h)^2 equals negative constants divided by the coefficients,
# such equations are only possible if the RHS is non-negative,
# so check for negative potential solutions with the given constants.
# But since constants are positive, these equations won't be satisfied unless x - h is imaginary.
# Therefore, the problem constraints suggest that x are chosen so that these equations are satisfied
# with real solutions, i.e., the RHS must be >= 0, leading to consideration of the values carefully.
#
# However, the key observation: for equations:
# 3*(x - h)^2 + 2013 = 0 -> (x - h)^2 = -2013/3 = -671, impossible for real x
# Similarly, 2*(x - h)^2 + 2014 = 0 -> (x - h)^2 = -1007, impossible for real x
#
