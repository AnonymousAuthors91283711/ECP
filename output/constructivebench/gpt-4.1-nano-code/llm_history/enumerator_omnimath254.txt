The problem appears to involve finding the minimal value of a specific count of integers \( k \) in the range 1 to 2011 where the product mod 2012 with \( a \) is greater than that with \( b \). This involves comparing two functions over a finite set, which possibly relates to properties of modular multiplication and ordering.

Given the constraints, we want to find two distinct \( a, b \) between 1 and 2011 such that the count of \( k \in [1, 2011] \) where \((a \times k) \bmod 2012 > (b \times k) \bmod 2012\) is minimized. We'll attempt a small enumeration over possible pairs \( a, b \), especially close to edges like near 1, 2, or 2011 to identify minimal values.

Here's a Python script to approximate this minimal value, by checking small \( a, b \) pairs, counting the number of \( k \) in [1,2011], and tracking the minimal count.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (a, b) with small values
# Count the number of k in [1, 2011] where (a*k)%2012 > (b*k)%2012
# Report the pair(s) with minimal count found

N = 2012
limit = 2012
min_count = limit  # upper bound
min_pairs = []

for a in range(1, 10):  # small sample for efficiency
    for b in range(1, 10):
        if a == b:
            continue
        count = 0
        for k in range(1, limit):
            val_a = (a * k) % N
            val_b = (b * k) % N
            if val_a > val_b:
                count += 1
        print(f'Pair (a={a}, b={b}) -> count: {count}')
        if count < min_count:
            min_count = count
            min_pairs = [(a, b)]
        elif count == min_count:
            min_pairs.append((a, b))

print(f'Minimal count found: {min_count}')
print('Pairs achieving this count:', min_pairs)
```
