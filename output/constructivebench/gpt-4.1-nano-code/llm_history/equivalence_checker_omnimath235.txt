Ground Truth Answer: {n | n ≡ 0 [MOD 8] ∨ n ≡ 3 [MOD 8]}
Proposed Answer: { n | n = 20 ∧ (7 * (n * (n - 1) / 2 + 2 * n * n) = 5 * (3 * n * (3 * n - 1) / 2 - (n * (n - 1) / 2 + 2 * n * n))) }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding natural numbers n where the ratio of boys' matches to girls' matches is 7/5.

2. The ground truth answer gives all numbers congruent to 0 or 3 modulo 8.

3. The proposed answer only gives n = 20 as a solution, with a very specific condition that only holds for n=20.

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It only provides one specific solution (n=20) when there are infinitely many solutions
- The condition is overly specific and doesn't capture the general pattern
- While n=20 is indeed in the ground truth set (since 20 ≡ 4 mod 8), it's not the only solution
