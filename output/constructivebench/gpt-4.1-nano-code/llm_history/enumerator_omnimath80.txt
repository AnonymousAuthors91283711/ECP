The problem appears to involve combinatorial number theory, particularly focusing on properties related to p-adic valuations and minimal bounds for certain function constructs. To assist in conjecturing and possibly proving the minimal value, I will consider small values of n and p, enumerate candidate m values within a feasible range, and check the conditions.

Given the constraints:
- n (a small dimension parameter)
- p (a small prime)
- We're searching for the minimal m satisfying the set conditions

I will:
- Fix small sample values for n and p
- For m from 1 up to a threshold (say 20), check if the set condition holds (since precise verification of the entire set is complex, I will approximate the checking process)

The code will:
- Define the set of m candidates
- For each candidate m, print it
- Verify basic approximate conditions (since properties involving padicValNat are complex, we'll assume for small values checking certain inequalities suffices)

```python
# Enumerate small values of n, p, and m to conjecture the minimal m satisfying conditions
def minimal_m(n, p, max_m=20):
    from math import prod
    
    def padicValNat(p, x):
        count = 0
        while x % p == 0 and x > 0:
            x //= p
            count += 1
        return count
    
    # Generate candidate m values
    for m in range(1, max_m + 1):
        # Approximate check: For all small sequences a_i and functions f, test conditions
        # Here, we simplify by testing specific instances
        valid = True
        # For simplicity, test a sample function f and sequence a
        # conditions would normally be checked rigorously, here we just simulate
        for a_vals in [[1]*n, [2]*n]:
            for f0 in range(1, 11):
                for f1 in range(1, 11):
                    a = a_vals
                    f = lambda x: f0 + x  # simple function
                    # Check existence of k' with the properties
                    k = 0
                    f_k = f(k)
                    f_kp = f(k+1)
                    if not (padicValNat(p, f_kp) < padicValNat(p, f_k) + m):
                        valid = False
                        break
                if not valid:
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            print(f"Candidate m: {m}")
            # When found, break as we want the minimal
            return m
    print("No suitable m found within range")
    return None

# Fix small n and p for an example
n_sample = 2
p_sample = 3
minimal_m(n_sample, p_sample)
```
