[write_program]
The problem involves two polynomials \( P \) and \( Q \), with roots \( z_i \) of \( Q \), and asks for the sum of evaluations \( P(z_i) \). I will write a Python program that:

- Defines these polynomials explicitly.
- Finds all roots of \( Q \) numerically.
- Evaluates \( P \) at these roots.
- Sums these evaluations.
- Prints each step immediately, streaming partial results.
- Since the roots may be complex, I will consider complex solutions and sort or handle them for clarity.
- Use small sample parameters as the polynomials are fixed; for efficiency and correctness, I will use numpy/scipy to find roots.
- Make sure the code is concise and within 400 tokens.

This will help conjecture the sum \( \sum P(z_i) \).

```python
import numpy as np

# Define polynomials P and Q coefficients
P_coeffs = [1, 0, -1, 0, 0, -1, -1]  # X^6 - X^5 - X^3 - X^2 - X
Q_coeffs = [1, 0, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 1]  # X^4 - X^3 - X^2 - 1

# Find roots of Q
roots = np.roots(Q_coeffs)
print("Roots of Q:", roots)

# Evaluate P at each root
evaluations = []
for i, z in enumerate(roots):
    # P(z) = z^6 - z^5 - z^3 - z^2 - z
    val = z**6 - z**5 - z**3 - z**2 - z
    evaluations.append(val)
    print(f"P at root {i} ({z}): {val}")

total_sum = sum(evaluations)
print("Sum of P(z_i):", total_sum)
```
