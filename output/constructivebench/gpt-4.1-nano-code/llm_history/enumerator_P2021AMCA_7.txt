This problem is asking to find the least value of the expression \((x y - 1)^2 + (x + y)^2\) over all real numbers \(x, y\). Since the problem is a typical optimization problem, we can attempt to find candidates for the extremum by analyzing where the gradient (partial derivatives) vanish.

To assist in conjecturing and verifying the minimum value, we will:
- Fix small sample values of \(x\) and \(y\)
- Check the values of the expression
- Include a systematic approach around critical points

Because the expression involves quadratic forms, the minimum occurs where both partial derivatives are zero. We can compute these conditions symbolically, but since the task is to generate enumerations to aid conjectures, we'll do a numeric search nearby expected critical points.

```python
import numpy as np

# Generate candidate points around some initial guesses
step = 0.1
x_vals = np.arange(-5, 5 + step, step)
y_vals = np.arange(-5, 5 + step, step)

# Store the minimal value found
min_value = float('inf')

# Enumerate through the candidate points
for x in x_vals:
    for y in y_vals:
        val = (x * y - 1) ** 2 + (x + y) ** 2
        print(f"x={x:.2f}, y={y:.2f}, value={val:.4f}")
        if val < min_value:
            min_value = val

# Find candidate with smallest value
print(f"Approximate minimum value: {min_value:.4f}")
```
