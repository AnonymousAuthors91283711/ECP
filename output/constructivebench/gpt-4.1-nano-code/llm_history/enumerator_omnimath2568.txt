The problem appears to ask for an infinite set of natural numbers with specific properties: 
- the set itself is infinite,
- for any two elements \(a, b\) in the set with \(a < b\), the sum \(a + b\) is squarefree.

To explore possible solutions, I will generate integers systematically, filter those that satisfy the properties, and print each valid element immediately. Since the set is infinite, I will limit the search to a certain range (e.g., first 1000 numbers) for practical reasons, then verify the squarefreeness condition for pairs.

Here is the Python code implementing this reasoning:

```python
import math

def is_squarefree(n):
    '''Check if n is squarefree (no prime squares dividing n)'''
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for p in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % (p*p) == 0:
            return False
    return True

omnimath2568_answer = []

# Generate candidate numbers
max_num = 1000
for num in range(1, max_num + 1):
    # Check if for all smaller elements, sum is squarefree
    valid = True
    for a in omnimath2568_answer:
        if a < num:
            s = a + num
            if not is_squarefree(s):
                valid = False
                break
    if valid:
        print(num)  # stream output as per instructions
        omnimath2568_answer.append(num)
```
