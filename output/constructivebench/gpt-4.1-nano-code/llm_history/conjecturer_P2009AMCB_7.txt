  round x = P2009AMCB_7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Near solution: x = 16 (total_factor ≈ 1.008)
Near solution: x = 17 (total_factor ≈ 0.9959999999999999)
Exact solution for x: 16.67 (corresponds to total_factor = 1). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The equation simplifies to find x where total_factor = (1 + 0.2) * (1 - 0.2) * (1 + 0.25) * (1 - x/100) = 1.  
Compute constants: (1.2 * 0.8 * 1.25) = 1.2 * (0.8 * 1.25) = 1.2 * 1 = 1.  
Thus, (1.2 * 0.8 * 1.25) * (1 - x/100) = 1 implies (1 - x/100) = 1 / 1 = 1.  
Solve for x: 1 - x/100 = 1 → x = 0, but within the approximates, the solution at x=16.67 gives total_factor ≈ 1. So, the closest integer x=17 makes total_factor ≈ 0.996, slightly below 1.  

Since the exact x corresponds to total_factor =1, rounding x=17 down, the answer is 17.  

Answer: <<<17>>>
