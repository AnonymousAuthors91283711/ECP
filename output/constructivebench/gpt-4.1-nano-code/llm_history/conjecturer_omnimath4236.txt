Maximum n: 4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The pattern and enumeration suggest the maximum n is constrained by c and the problem's combinatorial structure, with a maximum at n=4 for c ≥ 4. The pattern indicates that for c ≥ 4, the largest such n is 4. The answer should be constant with respect to c, given the maximum is 4 regardless of c.
