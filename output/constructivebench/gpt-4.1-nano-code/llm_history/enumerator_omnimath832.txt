This theorem explores sequences `squirrel` and `rabbit`, defined recursively, with initial conditions. I want to find the smallest `y > 0` such that `rabbit y > squirrel y`. The problem indicates looking for the minimal `y > 0` satisfying the inequality.

To help conjecture the solution, I'll:
- Generate early terms of `squirrel` and `rabbit` for small `k`.
- Check where `rabbit y > squirrel y`.
- Find the minimal such `y`.

By starting with small `k`, I will evaluate the recursive formulas directly, since:
- `squirrel(k+1) = 2 * squirrel(k) + 2019`
- `rabbit(k+1) = 4 * rabbit(k) - 2`

This can be simplified to compute the sequences up to some small `k`, then determine the earliest position where `rabbit y > squirrel y`.

```python
# Generate sequences and find the minimal y > 0 where rabbit y > squirrel y
squirrel = [1]  # base case: k=0
rabbit = [1]    # base case: k=0
max_k = 20  # limit to check early terms

for k in range(max_k):
    squirrel_next = 2 * squirrel[k] + 2019
    rabbit_next = 4 * rabbit[k] - 2
    squirrel.append(squirrel_next)
    rabbit.append(rabbit_next)

# Find the minimal y > 0 where rabbit y > squirrel y
for y in range(1, max_k + 1):
    if rabbit[y] > squirrel[y]:
        print(y)
        break
```
