This problem involves finding the least value of `t` satisfying the condition \(0 \leq t\) and \(5 \times \frac{t}{60} - 3 \times \frac{t}{60} = 1\). Simplifying the equation leads to a linear relationship, and the goal is to spot the minimum `t` that satisfies these constraints.

The equation simplifies to:
\[
(5 - 3) \times \frac{t}{60} = 1 \Rightarrow 2 \times \frac{t}{60} = 1 \Rightarrow \frac{t}{30} = 1 \Rightarrow t = 30
\]

Since `t` must be nonnegative and satisfy the equation, the minimum `t` is directly 30.

Here's a simple enumeration approach that tests `t` values around this point:

```python
# Enumerate t from 0 to 60 in small steps to find the minimal t satisfying the equation
# and the non-negativity constraint
for t in range(0, 61):
    # Check the simplified equation: (5 - 3)*(t/60) = 1
    lhs = (5 - 3) * (t / 60)
    if abs(lhs - 1) < 1e-6 and t >= 0:
        print(t)
```
