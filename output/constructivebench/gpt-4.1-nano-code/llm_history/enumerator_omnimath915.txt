The problem appears to involve finding the cardinality of a set \(S\subseteq \mathbb{N}\) characterized by a property involving elements \(a, b, c\) with inequalities \(a < b, c > b\), and membership or non-membership in \(S\). The property states that for each \(S\), \(P S\) holds iff: There exist \(a, b, c\) with \(a < b\), \(c > b\), \(a, c \in S\), and \(b \notin S\).

Intuitively, this describes sets \(S\) that contain at least one "pattern" of elements where an element \(a\) before \(b\) and an element \(c\) after \(b\) are in \(S\), while \(b\) is not.

To understand the structure, consider small \(b\):

- For each \(b\), to satisfy \(P S\), there must exist \(a < b \in S\) and \(c > b \in S\), with \(b \notin S\). This means \(b\) is "sandwiched" between two in set elements \(a, c\).

This characterizes sets that **do not** have any "gap" fences: every such fence involves "breaking" the set at some \(b\), sitting between two elements of the set.

The sets that satisfy \(P S\) are exactly those which are **not** initial segments that are "gapless." Conversely, the sets that do **not** satisfy \(P S\) are those with no such gun, meaning:

- Sets that do **not** satisfy \(P S\): no such \(a,<b,c\) with \(a,c \in S\), \(b \notin S\). These are the **intervals** starting at 0 or some specific pattern of initial segments.

A key insight is that:

- If \(S\) is **cofinal**, i.e., contains all sufficiently large numbers, then there cannot be such "gap" as between elements because the set contains everything after some point.

- Sets that are not eventually everything are likely to contain such patterns unless they are empty, all or initial segments.

To confirm this heuristic, check small sets explicitly.

Given the complexity, the enumeration should look at small \(b\). For instance, for small \(b\), pick small \(a, c\) and try all possible \(S\).

However, to save effort, note that:

- The **sets that do not** satisfy \(P S\) are precisely those that can't have the pattern: sets that are initial segments or the entire \(\mathbb{N}\), or empty, or the finite initial segments.

Let's enumerate small sets to find their \(ncard\)s matching the property.

But since the problem is high-level, and in computational limits, we can generate all subsets up to size 5, check the property, and count.

Here's a practical way:

- Generate all subsets of \(\{0,1,2,3,4\}\) (small sample).
- For each, check whether \(P S\) holds.
- Count how many satisfy \(P S\).

This gives a conjecture for the count of such sets.

Now, implement code to:

- Generate all subsets of a small sample (e.g., first 5 integers).
- For each: check predicate.
- Count and print.

```python
# Enumerate subsets of {0,1,2,3,4} to approximate ratio
from itertools import chain, combinations

def subsets(s):
    return chain.from_iterable(combinations(s, r) for r in range(len(s)+1))

sample_set = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
answer = 0

for S in subsets(sample_set):
    S_set = set(S)
    # Check if: exists a < b, c > b with a,c in S and b not in S
    exists_pattern = False
    for b in S_set:
        for a in S_set:
            if a < b:
                for c in S_set:
                    if c > b:
                        # Found the pattern
                        exists_pattern = True
                        break
                if exists_pattern:
                    break
        if exists_pattern:
            break
    if exists_pattern:
        answer += 1
        print(f'Set: {sorted(S_set)} satisfies P S')

print(f"Total sets satisfying P S: {answer}")
# The count here helps conjecture the total answer for small n
```
