Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℝ
Based on the pattern in the numerical approximations, the minimal value of 'a' stabilizes around \( \frac{N}{2^{N-1}} \). Since \( N = 2^n \), it simplifies to \( \frac{2^{n}}{2^{2^{n}-1}} = 2^{n - (2^{n}-1)} = 2^{1 - 2^{n-1}} \), which suggests the general formula is \( a = \frac{N}{2^{N-1}} \).  
Hence, the formula is consistent across the checked cases and can be expressed in Lean notation as:

<<<fun n : ℕ => (2 ^ n) / (2 ^ (2 ^ n - 1))>>>
