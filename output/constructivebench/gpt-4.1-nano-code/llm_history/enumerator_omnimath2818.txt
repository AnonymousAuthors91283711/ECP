This problem appears to be a variant of a number theory problem involving divisibility and intervals. The core challenge is to find the minimal positive integer \(N\) such that for some \(k\), every product over an interval \([k, k+N-1]\) is divisible by \(2010^2\).

Given the problem's structure, a feasible approach in code is:

- Fix small values for \(k\)
- For each candidate \(N\), check whether there exists some \(k\) such that all products over intervals \([k, m]\) with \(m \in [k, k+N-1]\) are divisible by \(2010^2\).
- Because the problem is about minimal such \(N\), enumerate \(N\) starting from 1 onward, and for each, try small \(k\).
- Stop when the first such \(N\) is found, printing it immediately.

To optimize:
- The divisibility condition \(2010^2 | \prod i \in [k, m] i\) needs to be checked efficiently.
- Since \(2010^2 = (2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 67)^2\), the prime factorization involves the primes 2, 3, 5, and 67.

Here is a code snippet capable of this enumeration:

```python
# Enumerate minimal N satisfying the divisibility condition
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = {}
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 67]:
        count = 0
        while n % p == 0:
            n //= p
            count += 1
        if count > 0:
            factors[p] = count
    return factors

target = 2010 ** 2  # prime factorization
target_factors = prime_factors(target)
# target factors: 2:2, 3:2, 5:2, 67:2

# For each candidate N starting from 1
N = 1
while True:
    found = False
    # Try small k, up to a certain limit to find a valid interval
    for k in range(1, 1000):
        # For each m in [k, k+N-1], check divisibility of product
        # To avoid large multiplication, check prime exponents in the product
        valid = True
        for m in range(k, k + N):
            # The product over [k, m] is product of integers from k to m
            # prime exponents in product are sum of exponents of each integer
            exponents = {p:0 for p in target_factors}
            for i in range(k, m + 1):
                for p in target_factors:
                    count = 0
                    temp = i
                    while temp % p == 0:
                        temp //= p
                        count += 1
                    exponents[p] += count
            # Check if exponents satisfy required minimum
            for p, req in target_factors.items():
                if exponents[p] < req:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            print(N)
            found = True
            break
    if found:
        break
    N += 1
```

This code methodically checks for small \(k\), and increasing \(N\) until the minimal one satisfied the divisibility condition, printing immediately when found. The code respects the requirements: streaming results, small enumeration, and efficiency considerations.
