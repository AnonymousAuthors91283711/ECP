This problem seems to involve exploring integer solutions `(a, b, c)` satisfying certain conditions involving common differences and relations between the terms. To help enumerate solutions, I’ll interpret the constraints step-by-step and write a Python script that searches over small sample values of `a, b, c`, checks the conditions, and prints solutions immediately when found. We are asked to prioritize exact values, avoid heavy computations, and keep output within 400 tokens.

Conditions analysis:
- `b - a = c - b` implies these three form an arithmetic progression: `a, b, c`.
- `a + b + c = 60`.
- `∃ r, (a - 2) * r = b` and `b * r = c + 3`.

Substituting:
- Let `b = a + d`, `c = a + 2d`, because of the arithmetic progression.
- Sum condition: `a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) = 60`  
  → `3a + 3d = 60`  
  → `a + d = 20`

From `a + d = 20`, `b = 20`, `c = 20 + d`.

From the relations:
- `(a - 2) * r = b`, thus `r = b / (a - 2)` if `a ≠ 2`.
- `b * r = c + 3`, substituting `b` and `c`:
  - `b * b / (a - 2) = c + 3`
  - `b^2 / (a - 2) = a + 2d + 3`.

Since `b = 20`, and `a + d = 20`:
- `d = 20 - a`, so `b` is always 20.

Now, `a - 2 ≠ 0` for division:
- For `a ≠ 2`, `r = 20 / (a - 2)`.

From the second relation:
- `b * r = c + 3`
- substituting `r`:
- `20 * (20 / (a - 2)) = a + 2d + 3`
- `400 / (a - 2) = a + 2(20 - a) + 3`
- `400 / (a - 2) = a + 40 - 2a + 3 = -a + 43`.

Therefore:
- `400 / (a - 2) = -a + 43`

Cross-multiplied:
- `400 = (-a + 43)(a - 2)`

Let me now write a Python script that checks integers around valid `a` values, considering the domain restrictions, and prints solutions where the equality holds with integer `r`. This will help, as it captures potential solutions.

```python
# Enumerate integers for 'a' around the region of interest, avoiding division by zero at a=2
for a in range(1, 40):  # limited range to keep computation small
    if a == 2:
        continue  # division by zero in r formula
    numerator = -a + 43
    denominator = a - 2
    if numerator * denominator == 0:
        continue  # avoid trivial or invalid cases
    
    # Check if 400 divides evenly by (a - 2)
    if 400 % denominator == 0:
        r = 400 // denominator
        # b always 20
        b = 20
        c = 20 + (20 - a)
        # Verify second relation: b * r = c + 3
        if b * r == c + 3:
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, r={r}")
```

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code.

**Understanding the problem:**
The theorem states a set of conditions relating integers `a, b, c`:
- \( b - a = c - b \) (which simplifies to \( 2b = a + c \))
- \( a + b + c = 60 \)
- There exists `r` such that:
  - \((a - 2) * r = b\)
  - \(b * r = c + 3\)

From these, we can derive:
- Since \( b - a = c - b \), then \( 2b = a + c \).
- The sum: \( a + b + c = 60 \) implies \( c = 60 - a - b \).

Substituting \( c \):
- \( 2b = a + c = a + 60 - a - b = 60 - b \)
- \( 2b + b = 60 \Rightarrow 3b = 60 \Rightarrow b=20 \)

Thus, **b is fixed at 20**.

From the relations involving `r`:
- \((a - 2) r = b = 20\) ⇒ \( r = \frac{20}{a-2} \)
- \(b r = c + 3 \), with \(b=20\):
- \( 20 r = c + 3 \)

But \( c = 60 - a - 20 = 40 - a \). So plugging into the last:

\[ 20 r = (40 - a) + 3 = 43 - a \]

Substituting \( r = \frac{20}{a - 2} \):

\[ 20 \times \frac{20}{a-2} = 43 - a \]
\[ \frac{400}{a-2} = 43 - a \]

Cross-multiplied:

\[ 400 = (a-2) (43 - a) \]

Expanding:

\[ 400 = (a - 2)(43 - a) = a \times 43 - a^2 - 86 + 2a \]
\[ 400 = 43a - a^2 - 86 + 2a \]
\[ 400 = (43a + 2a) - a^2 - 86 \

The provided code contains no implementation; it only mentions an import, theorem statement, and an unimplemented answer set. Since there is no code that enumerates solutions or demonstrates the intended logic, the program is non-functional and cannot produce outputs or be executed successfully.

According to the problem requirements, the program should generate and print solutions immediately, handle parameters efficiently, and follow other constraints. But with no implementation, it can't meet these expectations.

**Decision:** The original program is *not acceptable*.

**Corrected Program:**

Let's analyze the problem:  
Given the conditions:  
- \( b - a = c - b \Rightarrow 2b = a + c \) (arithmetic progression)
- \( a + b + c = 60 \)
- \( \exists r, (a - 2)r = b \) and \( br = c + 3 \)

From the above:  
Since \( a + c = 2b \), rewrite the sum: \( a + b + c = 60 \Rightarrow (a + c) + b = 60 \Rightarrow 2b + b = 60 \Rightarrow 3b = 60 \Rightarrow b = 20 \).

Now, with \( b=20 \), find \( a \) and \( c \).  
From \( 2b = a + c \Rightarrow 2 \times 20= a + c \Rightarrow 40 = a + c \).  
And from the other conditions:  
- \( (a - 2) r = b=20 \Rightarrow r = 20 / (a - 2) \) (assuming \( a \neq 2 \))
- \( br = c +3 \Rightarrow 20 r = c + 3 \)

Substitute \( c = 40 - a \),  

\( 20 r = (40 - a) + 3 = 43 - a \)

But \( r = 20 / (a - 2) \), so:

\[ 20 \times \frac{20}{a - 2} = 43 - a \]
\[ \frac{400}{a - 2} = 43 - a \]
\[ 400 = (43 - a)(a - 2) \]

Now, solve for \( a \):

\[ 400 = (43 - a)(a - 2)
