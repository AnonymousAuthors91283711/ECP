To approach this problem, we analyze the given relationships:

Given:
- \(a + b + c = 96\)
- \(a = 6c\)
- \(c = b - 40\)

From \(c = b - 40\), substitute into \(a = 6c\):
\[a = 6(b - 40) = 6b - 240\]

Sum equation:
\[a + b + c = 96\]
Replace \(a\) and \(c\):
\[ (6b - 240) + b + (b - 40) = 96 \]

Simplify:
\[6b - 240 + b + b - 40 = 96\]
\[8b - 280 = 96\]
\[8b = 376\]
\[b = 47\]

Calculate \(c\):
\[c = 47 - 40 = 7\]

Calculate \(a\):
\[a = 6c = 6 \times 7 = 42\]

Find \(|a - b|\):
\(|42 - 47| = 5\)

Thus, the exact answer is 5.

To implement the enumeration:
- Verify algebraically; here, the values are unique given the equations.

```python
# Calculated values based on the constraints
a = 6 * 7  # since c=7
b = 47
c = 7
answer = abs(a - b)
print(answer)  # should output 5
```
