. Enumerated answers: Total solutions: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem's recurrence and initial conditions suggest that the sequence s is constant at 1, since the transformations preserve or relate previous terms with no deviation away from 1, given the base cases s 0 and s 1.

Thus, for all n, s n = 1. The calculations in the recurrence do not alter this value.
