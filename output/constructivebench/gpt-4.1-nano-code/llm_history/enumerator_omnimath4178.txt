This problem appears to involve analyzing functions over finite sets and ratios, seeking a minimal constant \( C \) such that a certain inequality holds for all positive functions \( a : \mathrm{Fin}\,5 \to \mathbb{R} \). The key aspect is to consider the maximum difference \( |a_i / a_j - a_k / a_l| \) over distinct indices, with all \( a_i > 0 \).

To understand the minimal \( C \) satisfying this, we can:

- Fix small positive values for \( a_i \), such as 1 or 2, to find potential maxima.
- To explore extremal cases, try values that cause the ratio differences to be large, e.g., some \( a_i \) very small and others large.
- Enumerate configurations with such values, computing the ratios and their differences.
- Since the problem seeks the Least such \( C \), approximate the maximum difference over our sample configurations, then identify the candidate that approximates the supremum from above.

We will generate various sample \( a \), compute all possible ratios, find the maximum pairwise difference, and output these results. This can help conjecture the least possible constant.

```python
import itertools

# Generate candidate functions over 5 elements with positive values
# We choose small values to scan potential maxima
values = [1, 2, 10, 0.1]  # include very small and large to maximize ratio differences
indices = range(5)

max_diff = 0
candidates = []

# Generate all combinations of values assigned to a_i
for a_values in itertools.product(values, repeat=5):
    a = list(a_values)
    # Compute all ratios for pairs (i,j), i != j
    ratios = []
    for i in indices:
        for j in indices:
            if i != j:
                ratios.append(a[i] / a[j])
    # Compute all differences between ratios
    for r1 in ratios:
        for r2 in ratios:
            diff = abs(r1 - r2)
            if diff > max_diff:
                max_diff = diff
                candidates = [(a, r1, r2, diff)]
            elif diff == max_diff:
                candidates.append((a, r1, r2, diff))

# Output the maximum differences observed
print(f"Maximum ratio difference over sampled configurations: {max_diff}")

# For each candidate, print the configuration and the difference
for a, r1, r2, diff in candidates:
    print(f"Configuration: {a}, ratios: ({r1}, {r2}), difference: {diff}")

# The least possible C must be at least this maximum ratio difference
print(f"Conjectured minimal C â‰¥ {max_diff}")
```
