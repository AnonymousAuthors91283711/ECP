The problem is to find all positive integer pairs (g₁, g₂) such that 19*g₁ + 17*g₂ = 201, with g₁ > 0 and g₂ > 0. We want to enumerate candidate solutions, printing each that satisfies the equation, possibly highlighting the unique pair if it exists.

We'll iterate over a small range of g₁ values and compute g₂ accordingly, checking positivity and integrality. The approach is straightforward: for g₁ > 0, compute g₂ = (201 - 19*g₁) / 17 if integral and positive.

```python
# Enumerate all positive integer solutions to 19*g1 + 17*g2 = 201

solutions = []

for g1 in range(1, 201):  # upper bound chosen sufficiently large
    numerator = 201 - 19 * g1
    if numerator <= 0:
        break
    if numerator % 17 == 0:
        g2 = numerator // 17
        if g2 > 0:
            print((g1, g2))
            solutions.append((g1, g2))
```
