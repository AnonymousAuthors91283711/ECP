This problem appears to involve summing over a very large range (from \(10^{2018}\) to \(10^{2019}\)), counting the number of digits in each number, and then taking the sum of the counts. To assist in conjecturing and verifying the answer, I will generate a Python program that estimates the total number of digit counts over the interval, leveraging pattern recognition and enumeration for smaller ranges before extending reasoning to the large interval.

Since directly iterating over such huge numbers is impossible, I'll focus on analyzing the pattern for sums of digit counts for numbers in the ranges of powers of 10 and use these patterns to estimate the sum over the massive interval.

This code enumerates ranges from small to the larger scale, providing insight into the formula and approximate total.

```python
# This program estimates the sum of digits in numbers from 10^k to 10^{k+1}-1.
# It uses the pattern that for numbers from 10^k to 10^{k+1}-1:
# - There are 9 * 10^{k-1} numbers with k digits.
# - Each digit from 0-9 appears equally often in each position: 10^{k-1} times.
# - Total digits in that range: 9 * 10^{k-1} * (k), since each number has k digits.
# - Sum of digits in all numbers in that range: total digits * average digit value (which is 4.5).

def sum_digits_range(start_power, end_power):
    total_sum = 0
    for k in range(start_power, end_power):
        count_numbers = 9 * 10 ** (k - 1)
        total_digits = count_numbers * k
        sum_digits_in_range = total_digits * 4.5  # average digit value = 4.5
        print(f"Sum of digits for numbers from 10^{k} to 10^{k+1}-1: {sum_digits_in_range}")
        total_sum += sum_digits_in_range
    return total_sum

# Apply for the interval from 10^2018 to 10^2019 - 1
# Since the actual range is large, we just estimate based on the pattern above.
print("Estimating total sum of digits from 10^2018 to 10^2019 - 1...")
total_estimate = sum_digits_range(2018, 2019)
print(f"Estimated total sum of digits: {total_estimate}")
```
