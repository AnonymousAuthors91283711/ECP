The problem appears to involve a minimization or inequality over real functions, with a parameter \( n \geq 2 \). To conjecture possible answers for the function `omnimath83_answer(n)`, we should examine small values of \( n \), considering symmetry, constant functions, and trivial bounds, and enumerate potential values to help formulate a conjecture.

Given the statement, the set involves an inequality with sums and square roots. Since the problem is complex and high school-level, a common approach is testing simple functions \( a_i \) (e.g., all zeros, all equal, or linear functions) and parameters \( b \) to understand the behavior.

The code will:
- Pick small \( n \) (from 2 to, say, 5).
- For each \( n \), compute candidate minimal values for \( L \) based on simple function choices.
- Attempt different \( b \) to see the minimal possible value of the expression.
- Output candidate \( L \) values iteratively to aid in conjecture.

Efficiently, the code will try constant and symmetric functions to find lower bounds.

```python
import math

def evaluate_L(n, a_vals, b):
    # Evaluate the inequality's left side minus right side for given a and b
    sum_sqrt_abs_diff = sum(math.sqrt(abs(a - b)) for a in a_vals)
    sum_a = sum(a_vals)
    left = (L * sum_sqrt_abs_diff) + math.sqrt(n * abs(sum_a))
    right = sum(math.sqrt(abs(a)) for a in a_vals)
    return left - right

# Enumerate small n with test functions a_i and b
for n in range(2, 6):
    print(f"n = {n}")
    minimal_L_candidates = []
    # Try constant functions a_i = c
    for c in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
        # Try various b to minimize L
        for b in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
            a_vals = [c] * n
            sum_sqrt_abs_diff = sum(math.sqrt(abs(a - b)) for a in a_vals)
            sum_a = n * c
            sum_sqrt_abs_a = n * math.sqrt(abs(c))
            # Handle zero sum_sqrt_abs_diff to avoid division by zero
            if sum_sqrt_abs_diff != 0:
                L = (sum_sqrt_abs_a) / sum_sqrt_abs_diff
                print(f"Constant a={c}, b={b} => candidate L={L:.3f}")
                minimal_L_candidates.append(L)
            else:
                # When sum_sqrt_abs_diff=0, inequality reduces; check if L can be small
                pass
    # Try linear functions or more complex if needed
    # For simplicity, output minimal candidates
    if minimal_L_candidates:
        min_L = min(minimal_L_candidates)
        print(f"Estimated minimal L for n={n}: {min_L:.3f}\n")
```
