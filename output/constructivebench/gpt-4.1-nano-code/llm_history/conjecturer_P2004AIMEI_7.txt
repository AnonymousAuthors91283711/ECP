. Enumerated answers: 588. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on pattern and enumeration, the coefficient derived from multiplying factors with alternating signs for i in [0..14], the sum of squared coefficients suggests that the absolute value of the 2nd coefficient is 588. 

Hence, the closed form answer for P2004AIMEI_7_answer (as an absolute value) is:

<<<588>>>
