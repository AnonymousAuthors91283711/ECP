theorem olympiadbench1678 (k n : ℕ) (hk : 0 < k) (hn : 0 < n) :
    (7^k - 3^n) ∣ (k^4 + n^2) ↔ (k, n) ∈ olympiadbench1678_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: k=2, n=4, (7^2 - 3^4) divides (2^4 + 4^2). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
Based on the pattern and divisibility condition, when (7^k - 3^n) divides (k^4 + n^2), the satisfying pairs are those with specific small values of k and n where 7^k - 3^n divides the sum. The only known pair from enumeration is (k=2, n=4). 

Consequently, I propose the explicit set containing this pair.
