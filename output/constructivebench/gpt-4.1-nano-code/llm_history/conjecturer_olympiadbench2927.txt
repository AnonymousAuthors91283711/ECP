The pattern shows x ≈ (n + 1/ n), so for T=35, x ≈ n + 1/n with n=1 to 9. The pattern suggests the minimal x occurs at n=1, as x decreases with increasing n. Thus, the minimal x satisfying the condition is at n=1, x= (1 + 1) = 2, but since the enumerated answer is approximately 1.02857, matching 1 + 1/ n with n=35, i.e., x = 1 + 1/35. Since T=35 is fixed, and the minimal such x occurs at n=35, then x = 35 + 1/35.

In conclusion, the minimal x is exactly T + 1/T.

Thus, the expression is:

Given the enumeration of the solutions and the pattern in the fractional parts (around 0.02857), the candidate answer seems to be related to the fractional structure of the solutions. In particular, the solutions appear to follow from the equation:

\[
\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor / (x - \left\lfloor x \right\rfloor) = T
\]

and the pattern in the numerators and denominators suggests the solutions might be of the form:

\[
x = n + \frac{n}{T}
\]

which is consistent with the approximate solutions from the enumeration, where the fractional part is close to \( \frac{1}{T} \).

The existing error arises because \( T \) is a local variable in the theorem's scope but is not available in the abbreviation. We want a general formula in terms of \( T \), which is fixed as 35 in the theorem's assumptions, but since the answer should be a closed-form expression, we can define it as a function of \( T \).

Hence, the correct answer, which applies generally, is:

\[
x = \frac{T + 1}{T}
\]

since this matches the pattern of solutions where the fractional part, approximately, equals \( \frac{1}{T} \).

**Final (fixed) Lean answer:**

<<<fun T : ℝ := (T + 1) / T>>>

**Explanation:**

- We define the answer as a function of \( T \).
- The pattern in enumerated values indicates solutions roughly at \( x \approx 1 + \frac{1}{T} \).
- The formula \( \frac{T + 1}{T} \) reproduces this pattern succinctly and matches the approximate numerical solutions provided.
- This expression is well-formed in Lean, avoiding uses of an undefined local variable.

This provides a closed-form, generalized answer aligned with the given data and constraints.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The main error arises because in Lean, the syntax for defining an abbrev with a function (or expression depending on a variable) is `fun` or `λ`, not `:=`. The problematic line: 

```lean
noncomputable abbrev olympiadbench2927_answer : ℝ := fun T : ℝ := (T + 1) / T
```

should instead be:

```lean
noncomputable abbrev olympiadbench2927_answer : ℝ := fun T : ℝ => (T + 1) / T
```

This aligns with Lean's syntax that an `abbrev` for a function takes `fun` or `λ` (lambda) notation with `=>` to specify the body.  

Furthermore, from the enumerated data, the pattern indicates that the minimal value of `x` satisfying the condition `⌊x⌋ / (x - ⌊x⌋) = T` corresponds approximately to `x = (T + 1) / T`, making the summation or minimal solution for the actual problem match this form. Since the problem states that the answer be in closed form and the minimal `x` corresponds to that expression, the answer should be this function generalized over `T`.

Thus, the fixed, general answer expression is:

<<<fun T : ℝ => (T + 1) / T>>>

This is consistent both with the enumerated data points and with encoding in Lean's syntax.

The problem asks to find a closed-form expression for the least real number \(x > 0\) such that \(\lfloor x \rfloor / (x - \lfloor x \rfloor) = T\), where in the context of the theorem \(T=35\). The enumerated examples suggest that for each integer \(n \ge 1\), the corresponding \(x \approx n + \frac{1}{n}\), because the floor is \(n\), and the fractional part is about \(\frac{1}{n}\). 

From the relation \(\lfloor x \rfloor / (x - \lfloor x \rfloor) = T\):

\[
\frac{n}{x - n} = T \quad \Rightarrow \quad x - n = \frac{n}{T} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = n + \frac{n}{T} = n\left(1 + \frac{1}{T}\right)
\]

to satisfy the fractional part \(\frac{1}{n}\), which matches the data from the enumerations. The minimal \(x > 0\) with this property occurs at \(n=1\), giving \(x = 1(1 + 1/T) = 1 + 1/T\).

In Lean, the generic formula for the least such \(x\) for general \(T\) is

\[
x = (T + 1)/T
\]

which matches the pattern in the enumerations for \(\ T=35\), giving \(x = (35+1)/35 = 36/35 \approx 1.02857 \), precisely the value shown.

The initial code snippet attempts to define this as an anonymous function, but produces syntax errors because of incorrect syntax. The correct way is:

```lean
noncomputable abbrev olympiadbench2927_answer : ℝ := (T + 1)/T
```

and within the proof context, with \(T=35\), this evaluates to \(36/35\).

The problem is to find a real number \( x \) such that \( \lfloor x \rfloor / (x - \lfloor x \rfloor) = T \) (with \( T=35 \)), and \( x \) is minimal satisfying these conditions. The division involves the fractional part and the floor, suggesting a formula involving the fractional part \( \{x\} \).

From the enumerations, for each \( n \ge 1 \):

- \( x \approx n + \frac{1}{T} \),
- Floor of \( x \) is \( n \),
- The fractional part \( \{x\} \approx \frac{1}{T} \),
- The ratio \( \lfloor x \rfloor / (x - \lfloor x \rfloor) \to T \).

The minimal such \( x \) occurs at \( n=1 \), thus:

\[ x = 1 + \frac{1}{T} = \frac{T+1}{T} \].

In Lean, since the answer is relative to `T`, and for the minimal \( x \), the expression simplifies to the same form for all \( T \). The previous "noncomputable" keyword was misplaced as it is for definitions involving computation, but this is a closed-form expression.

**Final fixed answer:**

<<<(T + 1) / T>>>

This expression is a straightforward, closed-form, general answer for the problem. It aligns with the enumerated example where the smallest \( x \) with the given property is when \( n=1 \).
