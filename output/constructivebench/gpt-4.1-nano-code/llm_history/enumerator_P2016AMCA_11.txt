This problem involves analyzing the intersections and unions of subsets (singers, dancers, actors) within a set of 100 students, with certain counts of students not in each subset. The key data points:
- Total students: 100
- Non-singers: 42
- Non-dancers: 65
- Non-actors: 29
- No student can be all three simultaneously.

We need to find the size of the union of pairwise intersections: |(singers ∩ dancers) ∪ (singers ∩ actors) ∪ (dancers ∩ actors)|

Given the data, the problem resembles inclusion-exclusion, but since the actual subsets are unspecified, we'll enumerate possible counts of the pairwise intersections, ensuring they satisfy the given constraints. The approach:
- Calculate sizes of individual subsets from their complements.
- Use these to bound and enumerate possible intersection sizes.
- For each valid configuration, compute the union size.

Here's a Python code that:
- Checks consistent intersection counts based on complements
- Enumerates possible intersection sizes
- Calculates and prints the union size

```python
# Enumerate possible intersection sizes based on given constraints
# Total students: 100
# Given non-member counts:
# |Sᶜ|=42 → |S|=58
# |Dᶜ|=65 → |D|=35
# |Aᶜ|=29 → |A|=71
# No student is in all three: |S ∩ D ∩ A| = 0

# Computing bounds for pairwise intersections:
# For each pair, their intersection size:
# Must satisfy:
# - Intersection size <= min of the two subsets
# - The counts of students outside each subset constrain overlaps.

# Let's set the sizes of individual sets:
size_S = 58
size_D = 35
size_A = 71

# For each pair, the intersection size can range from 0 to min of set sizes, but constrained by the total.

# To get the union of the three pairwise intersections:
# Use inclusion-exclusion:
# Union size = |S∩D| + |S∩A| + |D∩A| - sum of overlaps of three (which is zero) + the remaining students

# Since no student is in all three, the maximum union of the three pairwise intersections is limited.

import itertools

def enumerate_union():
    max_size = 0
    # Reasonable range for intersection sizes:
    max_s_d = min(size_S, size_D)
    max_s_a = min(size_S, size_A)
    max_d_a = min(size_D, size_A)
    for s_d in range(max_s_d + 1):
        for s_a in range(max_s_a + 1):
            for d_a in range(max_d_a + 1):
                # Overlaps must satisfy constraints:
                # For example, total students involved in pairwise intersections:
                involved = s_d + s_a + d_a
                # To avoid overcounting, the students in intersection:
                # total intersection (pairwise) minus students in all three (which is zero)
                total_union = s_d + s_a + d_a  # Simplified as no triple overlap
                # The union of the pairwise intersections cannot exceed total students
                if total_union <= 100:
                    print(f"Possible pairwise intersections: S∩D={s_d}, S∩A={s_a}, D∩A={d_a}")
                    print(f"Union size of pairwise intersections: {total_union}\n")
                    yield total_union

for answer in enumerate_union():
    print(f"Estimated union size: {answer}")
