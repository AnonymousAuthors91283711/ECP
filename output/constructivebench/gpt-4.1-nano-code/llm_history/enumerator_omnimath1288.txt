The problem appears to involve summing over functions from a finite set, considering the image cardinality of those functions, and then dividing by the size of the set. To generate conjectures and explore answers, I will examine small values of `n`, particularly since `n` is fixed at 2013 in the theorem, but we can test smaller `n` for patterns.

Key points:
- For `a = Finset.Icc 1 n`, this is the set `{1, 2, ..., n}`.
- `X` is the set of all functions `f : Fin n â†’ a`, where `Fin n` is `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`.
- For each `f`, `Y f` gives the number of distinct images of `f`.
- The sum is over all such functions, then divided by `X.card = n^n`.
- We will enumerate functions for small `n`, compute the sum, and conjecture the pattern.

Here's the implementation:

```python
# Enumerate all functions from a set of size n to itself
# Calculate the sum of the number of distinct images for all functions
# Exported to explore potential pattern/conjecture
from itertools import product

def enumerate_functions_and_sum(n):
    a = range(1, n+1)
    total_sum = 0
    count_functions = n ** n
    # Generate all functions: n^n possibilities
    for f in product(a, repeat=n):
        # Count distinct values in function f
        distinct_values = len(set(f))
        total_sum += distinct_values
    average = total_sum / count_functions
    print(f"n = {n}: total sum of image cardinalities = {total_sum}")
    print(f"Total functions: {count_functions}")
    print(f"Average image cardinality: {average}")
    return average

# Test small values to observe pattern
for test_n in range(1, 6):
    enumerate_functions_and_sum(test_n)
```

This code:
- Enumerates all functions from an `n`-element domain to itself.
- Computes the total sum of their image counts.
- Calculates the average (expected number of distinct images over all functions).
- Prints results immediately for each small `n`.

Using these outputs, we can conjecture a formula or asymptotic behavior for large `n` such as 2013. (For larger `n`, enumeration is infeasible, but small `n` patterns may guide us toward the exact answer.)
