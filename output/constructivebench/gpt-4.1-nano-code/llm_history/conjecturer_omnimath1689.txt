Total solutions: 14. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern shows n decreasing from 151 by 11 each time, starting from 151, with the condition 11k + 2n = 2007, and n ≤ k. Based on the enumeration, total solutions are 15, with the sequence starting at n=151. Thus: 

<<<(2007 - 2 * 8) / 11 = 151 / 11 = 13.72 (incorrect for sequence)>>> 

Actually, since n decreases by 11 starting at 151 and ending at 8, the total number of solutions is (151 - 8)/11 + 1 = 14. Each value of n corresponds to k = (2007 - 11k)/2 satisfying the constraints.

Final answer: 

<<<if 11 ∣ (2007 - 2 * n) then (n : ℕ) := (2007 - 2 * n) / 11 else 0>>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Total solutions: 14. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The core issue with the proposed answer is that it attempts to compute an explicit value from the constraints involved in the set, but it assigns a fractional (non-integer) value (13.72) to a variable of type ℕ, which causes a type mismatch error in Lean. 

Given the enumerated solutions, the set of n's are: 151, 140, 129, 118, 107, 96, 85, 74, 63, 52, 41, 30, 19, and 8, totaling 14 solutions. These correspond to specific values of n which satisfy the linear Diophantine condition 11k + 2n = 2007 with n ≤ k. 

Since the theorem states that the value of `omnimath1689_answer` equals the number of solutions, and observing the enumeration, the total count is 14. The answer should be expressed as 14 (the total number of solutions).

Thus, the fixed answer is simply 14, expressed directly as a natural number, which fits the type ℕ required for `omnimath1689_answer`.

<<<14>>>
