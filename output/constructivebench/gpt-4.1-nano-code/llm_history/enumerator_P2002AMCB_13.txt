The task appears to be about finding the least non-negative integer \( s \) that can be expressed as the sum of 18 consecutive integers starting from some \( k > 0 \), and that this sum is a perfect square. To enumerate candidate sums, we need to vary \( k \) over small positive integers, compute the sum of the 18 consecutive integers starting at \( k \), check if it's a perfect square, and record the least such sum.

We observe:
- Sum of 18 numbers starting from \( k \): \( \sum_{i=0}^{17} (k + i) = 18k + \sum_{i=0}^{17} i = 18k + \frac{17 \times 18}{2} = 18k + 153 \).
- For \( k \ge 1 \), enumerate sums for small \( k \) to find the least sum which is a perfect square.

```python
# Enumerate small positive k to find sums of 18 consecutive numbers starting at k,
# check if the sum is a perfect square. Print each candidate sum immediately.
import math

found_sums = []
k = 1
max_k = 20  # small sample to find candidates

while k <= max_k:
    s = 18 * k + 153  # sum of 18 consecutive integers starting from k
    root = int(math.isqrt(s))
    if root * root == s:
        print(s)
        found_sums.append(s)
    k += 1
```
