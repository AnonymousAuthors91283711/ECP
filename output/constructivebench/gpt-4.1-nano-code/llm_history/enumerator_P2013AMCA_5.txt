[write_program]
This problem involves dividing a total sum into three parts and comparing their differences, which requires enumerating possible values to find an answer that satisfies the given equations. Since the code references `abbrev` and `theorem` from Mathlib (Lean), but to simulate the enumeration in Python, I will focus on enumerating possible integer shares, computing `t` and `d`, and checking their difference.

Given total = 105 + 125 + 175 = 405, share = total / 3 = 135, so:
- t = share - 105
- d = share - 125
- Given share is fixed at 135, these are constants:
  - t = 135 - 105 = 30
  - d = 135 - 125 = 10
- Then, t - d = 20, which is the answer.

Since the total sum is fixed, the problem simplifies to confirming the difference equals 20.

To follow the task instructions, I will write a Python program that enumerates all valid sharing schemes, verifies the difference, and streams the answer, even though in this specific case, the values are fixed.

```python
# The program enumerates possible total distributions, computes share, and finds differences
# Based on the static total, but scaled to illustrate enumeration and result streaming
# In this case, total sum is fixed at 405, share should be 135
total = 405
for s in range(130, 140):  # small sample around the expected share
    share = s
    t = share - 105
    d = share - 125
    answer = t - d
    print(f"share: {share}, t: {t}, d: {d}, difference (t - d): {answer}")
```
