The problem appears to be about demonstrating a property involving the behavior of fractional parts of multiples of a real number \( x \). Specifically, it seems related to whether all sufficiently large multiples \( kx \) get close to an integer, or if not, then \( x \) is irrational with some properties relating to fractional parts.

To explore this, I will construct a Python program that enumerates candidate values of \( x \), especially rational approximations, since these are easier to analyze computationally and might provide insight into the statement — along with small sample parameters for \( N \).

The goal: Generate candidate \( x \) values over a small set (like rational numbers \( p/q \)), check their fractional parts when multiplied by \( k \), and see if the condition about fractional parts is violated or not, then print each candidate for further analysis.

```python
# Enumerate rational candidates x = p/q with small denominator q
# For each candidate, check fractional parts of multiples k*x for k ≤ n, for n up to a limit
# We seek to observe behavior related to the property involving fractional parts

import math

# Limit parameters
max_q = 10  # maximum denominator for rationals
max_n = 10   # maximum n to check
max_k = 10   # maximum k to check per n

# Function to compute fractional part
def fract(x):
    return x - math.floor(x)

# Enumerate rational candidates p/q with 1 ≤ q ≤ max_q
for q in range(1, max_q + 1):
    for p in range(1, q):  # p < q to ensure 0 < p/q < 1
        x = p / q
        print(f"Candidate x = {p}/{q} = {x}")
        # For each n, check fractional parts for k from 1 to n
        for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
            threshold = 1 / (n + 1)
            violated = False
            for k in range(1, min(n, max_k) + 1):
                frac_part = fract(k * x)
                if frac_part < threshold:
                    print(f"  n={n}, k={k}: frac={frac_part} < {threshold} (violates)")
                    violated = True
            if not violated:
                print(f"  n={n}: All fractional parts ≥ {threshold}")
```

This program systematically explores rational \( x \) with small denominators, then checks the behavior of fractional parts of their multiples. It prints candidate \( x \) immediately upon generation and outputs the relevant fractional part assessments, streamlining the exploration process to assist in forming conjectures about the original logical statement.
