This problem involves expressing a large number as a product of powers of 4 and 3, and then finding the sum of the exponents. The key is to factorize \( 2^{11} \times 6^5 \) into only powers of 4 and 3, and determine \( x, y \) such that \( 4^x \times 3^y = 2^{11} \times 6^5 \), with \( x + y \) as the answer.

Steps:
- Factor \( 6^5 \) into prime factors: \( 6^5 = (2 \times 3)^5 = 2^5 \times 3^5 \).
- Combine with \( 2^{11} \): \( 2^{11} \times 6^5 = 2^{11} \times 2^5 \times 3^5 = 2^{16} \times 3^{5} \).
- Express \( 4^x \) as \( (2^2)^x = 2^{2x} \).
- Express \( 3^y \) as itself.
- Equate: \( 2^{2x} \times 3^{y} = 2^{16} \times 3^{5} \), so:
  - \( 2x = 16 \Rightarrow x = 8 \),
  - \( y = 5 \).
- Sum: \( x + y = 8 + 5 = 13 \).

Here's a Python program to verify and enumerate such solutions, assuming small search spaces for teaching:

```python
# This program finds exponents x, y such that 4^x * 3^y = 2^16 * 3^5
# and x,y are positive integers. It enumerates possible pairs up to small limits.
# The found solutions are printed immediately.

max_x = 20
max_y = 20

for x in range(1, max_x + 1):
    for y in range(1, max_y + 1):
        # Check if 4^x * 3^y equals 2^16 * 3^5
        if 4**x * 3**y == 2**16 * 3**5:
            print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}")
            print(f"Sum x + y = {x + y}")
```
