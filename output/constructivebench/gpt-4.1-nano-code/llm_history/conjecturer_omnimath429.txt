The problem involves graphs with specific properties, leading us to analyze cliques and their sizes considering degree constraints. The input constraints imply that the minimal maximum clique size appears around the degree sum condition, hinting towards the Turán graph structure with the maximum clique of size 3. 

Based on the properties, the smallest clique size satisfying conditions appears to be 3.
