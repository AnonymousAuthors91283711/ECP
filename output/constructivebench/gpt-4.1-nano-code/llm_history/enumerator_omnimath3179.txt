This problem involves counting the number of odd integers `k` within a certain filtered set, where the set involves pairs `(m, n)` within a bounded interval satisfying a specific exponential equality. To explore possible values for `k`, we need to consider small `m` and `n` (say from 1 to 10) since the exponents grow rapidly, and check all `(m, n)` pairs satisfying the constraints. For each pair `(m, n)`, we compute the left and right sides of the equation, and if they match, then `k` is deduced from the equation, and we check whether `k` is within [1, 99] and odd.

Given the limited search space, an efficient enumeration can be done with nested loops, and printed results for each valid `k` when found.

```python
# Python code to enumerate all (m, n) pairs with small bounds,
# check the exponential equation, and record odd k satisfying the conditions.
# This helps conjecture the number of such k's satisfying the set filter.

for m in range(1, 11):
    for n in range(1, 11):
        lhs = 2 ** (4 * m**2) + 2 ** (m**2 - n**2 + 4)
        for k in range(1, 100):
            rhs = 2 ** (k + 4) + 2 ** (3 * m**2 + n**2 + k)
            if lhs == rhs and k % 2 == 1:
                print(k)
```
