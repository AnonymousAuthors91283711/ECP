p = 19, number of digits of p# ≈ 7
p = 23, number of digits of p# ≈ 9
p = 29, number of digits of p# ≈ 10
p = 31, number of digits of p# ≈ 12
p = 37, number of digits of p# ≈ 13
p = 41, number of digits of p# ≈ 15
p = 43, number of digits of p# ≈ 17
p = 47, number of digits of p# ≈ 18
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern of prime p and associated digit lengths, for p = 843301, the number of digits of p# (primorial) increases roughly following the pattern observed for previous primes. Estimating based on the pattern, the number of digits would be approximately 109.
