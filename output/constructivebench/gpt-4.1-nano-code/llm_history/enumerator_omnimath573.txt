This problem involves enumerating strategies and probabilities to find the greatest possible win probability given certain strategies and conditions. Since the payoffs and strategies are very simple, we can explicitly enumerate all possible strategies `s` mapping `(d1, d2)` to `Bool`, compute the associated probabilities, and print the maximum obtained probability.

The key idea: there are only 4 possible strategies (each assignment of Bool to the 4 pairs `(d1, d2)`). We'll evaluate each, compute the win probability, and find the maximum.

```python
# We need to enumerate all strategy functions from the pairs (d1, d2) to Bool
# Since d1, d2 are in Fin 2 (values 0 or 1), total 4 strategies.
# Each strategy is a mapping from ({0,1}, {0,1}) to Bool.

# Generate all strategies: each is a dict with keys (d1, d2)
# for each pair, assign True or False
strategies = []
for b00 in [False, True]:
    for b01 in [False, True]:
        for b10 in [False, True]:
            for b11 in [False, True]:
                s = {
                    (0, 0): b00,
                    (0, 1): b01,
                    (1, 0): b10,
                    (1, 1): b11
                }
                strategies.append(s)

max_prob = 0
max_strategy = None

# Evaluate each strategy
for s in strategies:
    p = (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(0.5 if s[(0,1)] else 0)
    print(f"Strategy: {s} --> Win probability: {p}")
    if p > max_prob:
        max_prob = p
        max_strategy = s

print(f"Maximum win probability: {max_prob} with strategy {max_strategy}")
```
