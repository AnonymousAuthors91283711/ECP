The problem involves iteratively applying a function `f` defined on natural numbers and real numbers, with recursive properties. Specifically:
- At n=0, `f 0 x = x + |x - 100| - |x + 100|`.
- For n ≥ 1, `f n x = |f (n - 1) x| - 1`.
We need to find the cardinality of the set `{x : ℝ | f 100 x = 0}`.

Given the recursive structure:
- The starting function at n=0 involves absolute values and is piecewise,
- Each subsequent step takes the absolute value of the previous and subtracts one,
- At n=100, the set of solutions to `f 100 x = 0` depends on nested absolute value functions.

To manage the scope:
- Choose sample values for n to observe behavior, e.g., at small n like 0, 1, 2.
- For each, analyze the solution set.
- Since the recursion applies many times, note the structure’s pattern and ideal candidate solutions.

The initial function at n=0:
``` 
f 0 x = x + |x - 100| - |x + 100|
```
- For `x ≥ 100`, `|x - 100| = x - 100`, so:
  `f 0 x = x + (x - 100) - |x + 100|`.
- For `x ≤ -100`, `|x + 100| = -(x + 100)`, so:
  `f 0 x = x + |x - 100| - (-(x + 100))`.
- For `-100 < x < 100`, `|x + 100|= x + 100`, `|x - 100|= 100 - x`.
- The solutions to `f 0 x = 0` at n=0 can be directly checked within these intervals.

Componentally, the recursive negative/absolute form indicates that the set shrinks as `n` increases, possibly leaving some discrete points.

I'll implement a code that:
- Computes the solutions for small n efficiently.
- Tracks the nesting pattern to estimate the possible number of solutions at i=100.

Given the problem's complexity, the exact count can be deduced as follows:

```python
# The computation suggests that at n=0, the solutions are the roots of f0 x=0.
# For x ≥ 100, f0 x = x + (x - 100) - (x + 100) = 2x - 200.
# Set to zero: 2x - 200=0 => x=100.
# For x ≤ -100, f0 x= x + (100 - x) - (-(x+100))= x + 100 - x + x + 100= 2x + 200.
# Set to zero: 2x + 200=0 => x=-100.
# For -100 < x < 100, f0 x= x + (100 - x) - (x + 100)= 100 - x.
# Set to zero: 100 - x=0 => x=100 (already counted), but note x in (-100, 100), so no solution here.

# So solutions at n=0: x=-100 and x=100.

# For each iteration, the form of solutions changes by taking absolute values,
# leading to solutions at points where previous solutions hit certain thresholds.

# At n=1:
# f1 x= |f0 x| -1
# For x=-100: f0(-100) = -100, |f0(-100)|=100, f1(-100)=100 -1=99, ≠0
# For x=100: f0(100)=100, |f0(100)|=100, f1(100)=100-1=99, ≠0
# For other points, check if f1 x=0: |f0 x|=1
# At previous solutions, |f0 x|=100, which does not give |f0 x|=1.
# Generally, very few solutions; solutions occur where |f0 x|=1 => f0 x=±1
# f0 x=1: x + |x -100| - |x + 100|=1
# Testing specific x:
# x=0: f0 0= 0+100 -100=0 ≠1
# x=-1:
# f0 -1= -1 + 101 - 99= 1 ≠1
# So the solution points at n=1 are where f0 x=±1, which for this example yields 2 points.
# Repeating this process for higher n, the number of solutions grows, but remains finite.

# The pattern suggests at n=100, the solutions are discrete points, possibly 2^n points in pattern.
# But since at each step |f(n-1) x|=1 leads to solutions, and these generate bifurcation points,
# the total solutions are powers of 2, specifically 2^n solutions for n=100.

# Therefore, the answer is 2^100 solutions at maximum.

answer = 2**100
print(answer)
```

This approach estimates that the solution set doubles at each iteration, starting from 2 solutions at n=0; thus at n=100, there are `2^100` solutions.

```python
# Final enumerated answer for the set size: 2^100
```
