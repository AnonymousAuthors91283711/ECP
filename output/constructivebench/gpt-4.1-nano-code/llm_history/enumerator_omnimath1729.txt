The problem involves exploring the sequence a(n) defined recursively, with the goal of understanding the periodicity of the sequence modulo 2014. To conjecture the minimal period p, we can compute a few initial terms of a(n), compute their floors, take modulo 2014, and check for repeating patterns.

We'll select small values of p, check for repeated modulo patterns in sequence, until we find the minimal p satisfying the condition.

```python
# Sequence a(n) as defined recursively,
# using floating point approximation for sqrt(2) and sequence terms.
def a(n, memo={0: 2**0.5}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n == 1:
        return 2
    prev = a(n - 1, memo)
    prev_prev = a(n - 2, memo) if n - 2 >= 0 else 2**0.5
    val = prev * (prev_prev ** 2)
    memo[n] = val
    return val

# Generate sequence values and compute floor modulo 2014
def sequence_modulo(n_terms):
    seq = []
    for i in range(n_terms):
        val = a(i)
        floor_mod = int(val) // 1 % 2014
        seq.append(floor_mod)
    return seq

# Search for minimal period p within a threshold
max_period = 20
sequence_length = 100
seq = sequence_modulo(sequence_length)

# Check for the smallest p where sequence repeats after p terms
for p in range(1, max_period + 1):
    is_periodic = all(seq[i] == seq[i + p] for i in range(sequence_length - p))
    if is_periodic:
        print(p)
        break
```

The problem involves a recursive sequence defined with real numbers, starting with sqrt(2), then 2, and continuing with a recurrence involving multiplication and powers. The theorem claims that there exists a minimal positive integer p that repeats the sequence modulo 2014 after some shift, i.e., the sequence is ultimately periodic modulo 2014 with period p.

The provided program attempts to approximate the sequence numerically, using floating points and store preliminary terms in a memo. It then converts each floating point to an integer, applies a floor, and takes modulo 2014, then searches for a minimal period p within 20, based on the computed sequence.

**Judgement:**
- The program is flawed in several ways:
  - Uses floating point arithmetic for a sequence involving sqrt(2) and powers; floating point inaccuracies will distort the integer behavior, especially over many iterations.
  - The sequence itself involves products of previous terms, which can grow or shrink rapidly, leading to overflows, approximations, or loss of precision.
  - The modulo operation applied simply on the floored value of a real approximation does not reliably reflect the sequence’s behavior modulo 2014.
  - The sequence is unlikely to be periodic in such a naive approximation, especially over only 100 terms.
  - The problem's nature suggests that a mathematical, possibly modular arithmetic approach or at least exact or symbolic computations would be required. The code uses approximations and does not check the true sequence modulo 2014.

Furthermore, the code outputs "Error: Program outputs empty result" because:
- The sequence may not settle into a pattern within 100 terms.
- The approximation may not match the actual sequence's periodicity.

Given these issues, **the code does not reliably find the sequence period**, and the output is empty, which does not satisfy the problem's goal.

**Acceptance decision:** The current program is **rejected** because it yields empty results and uses naive floating point approximations that are unreliable for this sequence's properties.

---

**Correction approach:**
- Use symbolic approximations only where exact calculations are impossible.
- Recognize that the sequence is recursive; attempting to find periodicity empirically is unwise.
- For such a problem, better approach involves identifying whether the sequence stabilizes or repeats in some pattern, or directly analyze the sequence's behavior.

**Given the problem's complexity, and the instruction to output immediately upon finding an answer,** here is a corrected, more robust code sketch
[refine_program]
The provided code snippet defines a recursive function `a : ℕ → ℝ` with some specific pattern, but the program is incomplete and contains placeholders (`sorry`) for the answer and proof parts. Since the enumerator produces no answers (error: program is empty), and the actual purpose is to identify a minimal positive integer `p` satisfying a periodicity condition modulo 2014 for the sequence of floor-values of `a m`, we should analyze whether the original program attempts to solve this problem.

Given the task, the program should:
- Enumerate candidate values of `p`, starting from 1 upward.
- For each candidate `p`, check whether the condition holds for sufficiently large `N` (probably starting from `N = 0`, examining the pattern in the sequence).
- Print out candidates until it finds the minimal `p` satisfying the condition.

The current code has multiple placeholders and is incomplete. Therefore, the existing code is invalid and produces no answers. It must be corrected to implement the enumeration properly.

**Judgment**: Since the original program is incomplete (contains `sorry` placeholders and produces no answers), it should be rejected.

<<<False>>>

**Corrected Program:**

```python
# The program enumerates candidate p-values starting from 1 upward,
# and checks if for all m ≥ N (for some N), the pattern repeats modulo 2014.
# For simplicity, we test for p up to a reasonable bound, say 1000.

# Note: We numerically approximate the sequence a_m for small m,
# as the sequence grows complicated, we focus on small m.

def a(m, memo={}):
    # Memoization for efficiency
    if m in memo:
        return memo[m]
    if m == 0:
        from math import sqrt
        v = sqrt(2)
    elif m == 1:
        v = 2
    else:
        v = a(m - 1, memo) * (a(m - 2, memo))**2
    memo[m] = v
    return v

# To check the periodicity, for each candidate p:
# we generate a sequence of floor(a m) for some ranges and verify the pattern repeats.

max_p = 100  # upper bound for candidate p
max_m = 50   # number of sequence elements to check, small for computational feasibility
answer_found = None
