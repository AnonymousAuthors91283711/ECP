The problem involves finding all triples of primes \((p, q, r)\) satisfying the divisibility conditions:

- \(p \mid q^r + 1\)
- \(q \mid r^p + 1\)
- \(r \mid p^q + 1\)

Because all are primes and the conditions are symmetric in the form, a practical approach is to consider small prime triples and test these divisibility conditions. 

To efficiently explore candidates:
- Use small primes (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) to generate triples.
- Remove duplicates and permutations that are symmetric.
- For each triple, check all three divisibility conditions.
- Output each triple immediately when all conditions are satisfied.

This brute-force method is feasible because the primes involved are small, and the total number of triples will be manageable.

```python
# Enumerate small primes to test
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]

# Check divisibility conditions for a prime triple
def check_condition(p, q, r):
    return ( (q ** r + 1) % p == 0 and
             (r ** p + 1) % q == 0 and
             (p ** q + 1) % r == 0 )

# Generate and test all combinations (with repetition since order matters)
for p in primes:
    for q in primes:
        for r in primes:
            if check_condition(p, q, r):
                print((p, q, r))
```
