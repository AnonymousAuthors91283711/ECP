theorem omnimath2669 (x : ℕ) : 
  x^2 + 2*x - x*(x + 1) = omnimath2669_answer x := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x = 0, expression = 0
x = 1, expression = 1
x = 2, expression = 2
x = 3, expression = 3
x = 4, expression = 4
x = 5, expression = 5
x = 6, expression = 6
x = 7, expression = 7
x = 8, expression = 8
x = 9, expression = 9
x = 10, expression = 10
x = 11, expression = 11
x = 12, expression = 12
x = 13, expression = 13
x = 14, expression = 14
x = 15, expression = 15
x = 16, expression = 16
x = 17, expression = 17
x = 18, expression = 18
x = 19, expression = 19. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The pattern from the enumerated answers shows that the expression equals x for all tested values; the algebra verifies that x^2 + 2x - x(x + 1) simplifies to x. Therefore, the formal answer is simply the projection of input onto itself.

<<<fun x : ℕ => x>>>
