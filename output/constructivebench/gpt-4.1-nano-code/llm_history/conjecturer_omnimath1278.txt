: f (-2) = omnimath1278_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Estimated f(-2) = 3.35. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Given the pattern of the enumerated answers around 3.35, the precise rational value approximating this is 67/20 (which equals 3.35). Thus, the answer is a rational number that matches the approximation.

: f (-2) = omnimath1278_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: (67 / 20) : ℚ. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 44, which is at ": ℚ" in "abbrev omnimath1278_answer : ℚ := (67 / 20) : ℚ", there is an error: unexpected token ':'; expected command.

The error indicates that in Lean, defining an abbrev with a value that is a rational number should not include a type annotation ": ℚ" after the value. Instead, the correct syntax is simply to write: abbrev name : type := value. Therefore, the line should be:

abbrev omnimath1278_answer : ℚ := 67/20

Regarding the pattern of the enumerated answer (which roughly corresponds to 3.35), 67/20 = 3.35 exactly, aligning with the estimate. 

Since the problem involves the functional equation 3 * f (1/x) + 2 * f x / x = x^2, and the answer is a constant rational, a natural guess is that f(x) might be quadratic or rational. Given that f(-2) = 67/20 and the estimate, the constant solution that fits the pattern is likely the simple rational number 67/20.

Therefore, the corrected and general answer in Lean syntax should be:

<<<(67 / 20) : ℚ>>>

This provides a proper closed form rational answer and fixes the syntax error.

**Final answer:**
<<<67/20>>>

**Explanation:** The syntax error arises from including ": ℚ" after the literal value. Removing the type annotation from the value and writing just `67/20` suffices. The pattern of the enumerated solutions hints that the value is exactly `67/20`, matching the estimated value.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
