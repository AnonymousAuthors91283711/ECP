Given the nature of the problem and the constraints, I will create a Python script to systematically analyze potential functions \(f : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}\) that satisfy the given functional equation:
\[
f(x - f(y)) = f(f(x)) - f(y) - 1
\]
for all integers \(x, y\). The goal is to generate possible solutions by enumerating functions with specific parameters, potentially linear functions, to explore solutions efficiently.

Since the problem involves an infinite domain, and the exact solution might be linear functions, I'll restrict the enumeration to affine functions \(f(x) = a x + b\), where \(a, b \in \mathbb{Z}\). The code will check small ranges for \(a\) and \(b\), and print all solutions satisfying the equation on a few sample points (\(x, y\)), to conjecture the general form.

This approach aligns with the instructions: print each candidate solution immediately, prioritize exact matches, and keep the total output within limits.

```python
# Enumerate affine functions f(x) = a*x + b for small integer coefficients
# Check if they satisfy the functional equation for a sample set of x, y
# Print solutions immediately when they meet the constraints

def check_function(a, b, test_points=5):
    # Check the functional equation on small sample points
    for x in range(test_points):
        for y in range(test_points):
            lhs = a * (x - (a * y + b)) + b
            rhs = a * (a * x + b) + b - (a * y + b) - 1
            if lhs != rhs:
                return False
    return True

for a in range(-3, 4):  # small range for slope
    for b in range(-3, 4):  # small range for intercept
        if check_function(a, b):
            def f(x, a=a, b=b):
                return a * x + b
            print(f"Candidate: f(x) = {a}*x + {b}")
            # Verify on some more points
            valid = True
            for x in range(-3, 4):
                for y in range(-3, 4):
                    lhs = f(x - f(y))
                    rhs = f(f(x)) - f(y) - 1
                    if lhs != rhs:
                        valid = False
                        break
                if not valid:
                    break
            if valid:
                print(f"Confirmed solution: f(x) = {a}*x + {b}")
```
