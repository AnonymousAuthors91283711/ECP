This problem involves solving a system of four linear equations in four variables and enumerating possible solutions. We'll consider small rational values for the variables, evaluate the constraints, and find candidate solutions.

Our approach:
- Define the equations.
- Solve the system symbolically or via enumeration over rational fractions.
- For efficiency, use the fact that these are linear equations; thus, we can solve linearly.
- Enumerate solutions with small integer or rational values around the initial solution.
- Print solutions as soon as they are found.

Let's implement a straightforward enumeration over small integer values for the variables, then verify the equations.

```python
# Enumerate small integer quadruples (x, y, z, w) to find solutions satisfying the equations
# with small bounds to keep computation quick and within token limits.

for x in range(-10, 11):
    for y in range(-10, 11):
        for z in range(-10, 11):
            # For each triple, solve for w using one of the equations:
            # Equation 1: 2x + y + z + w = 1 => w = 1 - 2x - y - z
            w1 = 1 - 2*x - y - z
            # Check other equations:
            eq2 = (x + 3*y + z + w1) == 2
            eq3 = (x + y + 4*z + w1) == 3
            eq4 = (x + y + z + 5*w1) == 25
            if eq2 and eq3 and eq4:
                print(f"x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, w={w1}")
```
[refine_program]
The provided program enumerates small integer quadruples (x, y, z, w) within bounds from -10 to 10 and checks if they satisfy three of the four equations (since w is derived from the first). It does not process floating point solutions or larger solutions, and the constraints may be too tight, possibly missing solutions with non-integer or larger values.

Given the system:
```
1) 2x + y + z + w = 1
2) x + 3y + z + w = 2
3) x + y + 4z + w = 3
4) x + y + z + 5w = 25
```
it's a linear system with 4 equations and 4 variables. Exact solutions satisfying all equations are likely to be rational or integer solutions. The brute-force search over small integers may miss solutions if they are outside the small bounds.

**Analysis & Verdict:**
- The program should theoretically find solutions if they exist among small integers, but if there are solutions with larger values or rational solutions, it won't find them.
- The system can be solved algebraically to check whether solutions exist and whether they are integers or not.

**Conclusion:**
- Since the problem is a formal proof with four equations, a better approach would be to algebraically solve the linear system.
- The enumeration is a heuristic that may not always find solutions, especially if they are not small integers.
- The current code outputs nothing because no solutions were found in the small bounds, which does not necessarily mean that solutions do not exist.

**Acceptance:**
- According to instructions, since the code does not produce any answers ("empty result") and the problem likely expects an algebraic solution, the enumeration method is insufficient.
- Therefore, the original program should be rejected (>>>False>>>), unless the question demands integer solutions within the bounds, which is here uncertain.

**Corrected Program:**
To be aligned with the formal mathematical goal, we should algebraically solve the system and check if W is uniquely determined and consistent.

```python
# Algebraic solution for the system:
# From the first equation: w = 1 - 2x - y - z
# Substitute into the other equations:

# Equation 2:
# x + 3y + z + w = 2
# => x + 3y + z + (1 - 2x - y - z) =

The problem provides a formal theorem statement with constraints involving four real variables, but the actual solution (value of w) is missing (`sorry`). The description indicates that the implementation (program) should generate possible answers, evaluate constraints, and ultimately determine the specific value of w.

However, the provided "Program" is None and the enumerated answers are an error message. This means an actual enumeration or computation program is missing entirely. Since the goal is to produce a working Python program that, upon execution, finds the value of w satisfying the constraints, the current code fails to do that.

My judgment:
- The current program is empty and thus produces no output and is incomplete.
- To meet the requirements, the program should instantiate sample values or solve the system of equations, then output the value of w.

Acceptance:
>>>False<<<

Correction:
- Implement a program that solves the linear system of equations derived from the constraints.
- Since the problem asks to find w, and the system is linear, solving it analytically (using numpy or sympy) ensures correctness.
- The program should print the solution for w immediately when computed, satisfying the streaming requirement.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define coefficients matrix A and constants vector b based on the constraints:
# 2x + y + z + w = 1
# x + 3y + z + w = 2
# x + y + 4z + w = 3
# x + y + z + 5w = 25

A = np.array([
    [2, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 3, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 4, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 5]
], dtype=float)

b = np.array([1, 2, 3, 25], dtype=float)

# Solve the system
solution = np.linalg.solve(A, b)

x, y, z, w = solution

print(w)
```
