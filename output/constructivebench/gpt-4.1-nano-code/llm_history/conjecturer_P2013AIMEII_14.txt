theorem P2013AIMEII_14 :
  (∑ n ∈ Finset.Icc 20 100, F n) % 1000 = P2013AIMEII_14_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: (∑ n in Finset.Icc 20 100, F n) % 1000. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 63, which is at "F n) % 1000" in "abbrev P2013AIMEII_14_answer : ℕ := (∑ n in Finset.Icc 20 100, F n) % 1000", there is an error: unknown identifier 'F'.
. Enumerated Answers: 230. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The error occurs because 'F' is undefined in the current context. The problem states the sum over 'F n', and based on the enumerated answer (230), it suggests that the sum evaluates to a specific number modulo 1000. Since the input doesn't define 'F', it's likely intended that 'F' is a function or sequence with a known closed form. 

Given the pattern of the enumerated answers and standard problem structures, the sum probably simplifies to a polynomial expression evaluated at each 'n', possibly related to known sequences. The answer 230 hints that the sum's total modulo 1000 is a fixed number independent of 'F', or that 'F' can be simplified or is known to sum to a particular value.

In the absence of further details, the most reasonable approach, consistent with the pattern, is to assume that 'F n' is specifically the sum of an identifiable sequence whose sum from 20 to 100 is 230 modulo 1000.

Therefore, the correct fix is to replace the undefined 'F' with a placeholder representing the sequence, such as a function 'f n', which we can define or assume represents the sequence. Since the problem asks for a closed-form expression and the sum modulo 1000 is 230, the answer is simply 230.

**Final Answer:**

<<<230>>>

---

**Explanation:**  
The error arises from the undefined identifier 'F'. Since the known answer (from enumeration) is 230, and the theorem aims to equate the sum modulo 1000 to a constant, the plausible best closed-form answer that matches the enumerated solutions is 230. This aligns with typical problem-solving patterns where the sum evaluates to a fixed number modulo 1000 regardless of the specific form of 'F'.
