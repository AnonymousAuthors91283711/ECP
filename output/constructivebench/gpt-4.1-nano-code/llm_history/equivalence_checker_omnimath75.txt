Ground Truth Answer: {m | m ≠ 1}
Proposed Answer: {m : ℕ | 2 ≤ m}
<<<Close>>>

The proposed answer {m : ℕ | 2 ≤ m} is very close to the ground truth {m | m ≠ 1}, but not exactly equivalent. The difference is that the proposed answer excludes 0 and 1, while the ground truth only excludes 1 (allowing 0). Since the problem specifies hm : 0 < m, both answers would be equivalent in the context of the theorem, but strictly speaking as set definitions they differ on m=0.
