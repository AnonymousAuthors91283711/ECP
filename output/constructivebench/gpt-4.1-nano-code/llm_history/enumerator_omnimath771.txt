The problem asks to compute the sum of the digits of the binomial coefficient C(1000, 100). We can do this by:

1. Computing C(1000, 100) efficiently.
2. Converting the result to a string and summing its digits.
3. Printing the sum immediately once computed.

Since Python can easily handle large integers, we only need to implement the calculation and summation step.

```python
import math

# Compute binomial coefficient C(1000, 100)
n, k = 1000, 100
binom = math.comb(n, k)

# Convert to string, sum the digits, and print
digits_sum = sum(int(d) for d in str(binom))
print(digits_sum)
```
