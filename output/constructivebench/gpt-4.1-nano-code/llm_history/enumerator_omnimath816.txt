The problem appears to involve evaluating the floor of the factorial of 2002 divided by the sum of factorials from 1! to 2001!, and then finding its value. To assist in guessing the exact answer, we can approximate the sum of factorials and compare it to (2002)!

Note that the sum of factorials from 1! to n! is dominated by n!, and for large n, it is slightly larger than n! — but the difference is small compared to n!. For small n, this can be checked directly; for large n, approximate ratios help.

Let's implement a program that:
- Enumerates factorials from 1! to 2001!
- Computes the sum
- Compares (2002)! with that sum
- Computes the floor of their ratio

Since the numbers are huge, compute approximately using logs to avoid overflow, then confirm with high precision.

```python
import math

# Compute factorials for 1! to 2001! using logs for efficiency
max_n = 2001
factorial_logs = [0.0]  # log(1!) = 0
for i in range(1, max_n + 1):
    factorial_logs.append(factorial_logs[-1] + math.log(i))

# sum of factorials in log-space
# sum_ = sum of exp(log(i!))
# To avoid summing enormous numbers directly, use log-sum-exp trick.

# Compute 2002!
log_2002_factorial = factorial_logs[-1] + math.log(2002)

# Compute sum of factorials from 1! to 2001! in log space
# sum_{i=1}^{2001} i! = sum of exp(factorial_logs[i])
# Use logarithmic sum
import math

max_log = max(factorial_logs[1:])
sum_exp_logs = 0.0
for i in range(1, max_n + 1):
    sum_exp_logs += math.exp(factorial_logs[i] - max_log)
log_sum = max_log + math.log(sum_exp_logs)

# Compute ratio approximation
ratio_log = log_2002_factorial - log_sum

# Estimate the ratio
ratio_estimate = math.exp(ratio_log)

# The floor of the ratio
floor_ratio = math.floor(ratio_estimate)

print(f"Estimated factorial of 2002: exp({log_2002_factorial})")
print(f"Estimated sum of factorials from 1! to 2001!: exp({log_sum})")
print(f"Approximate ratio: {ratio_estimate}")
print(f"Floor of the ratio: {floor_ratio}")
```

This code estimates the value of the floor of (2002)! divided by the sum ∑_{i=1}^{2001} i!, providing a good guess for the answer.
