This problem asks to find the number of 31-element subsets (`s`) of the 8×8 grid, with the property that no two points in the subset are at a Euclidean distance of√5 (which corresponds to knight-move moves in chess). Essentially, we're counting 31-sized vertex subsets avoiding "knight's moves" in an 8×8 grid.

Given the combinatorial nature, and the difficulty in brute-force enumeration, I will select a small sample to explore possible subset counts, focusing on pairs that violate the condition (distance exactly √5). Since the problem is complex, I'll generate potential sets that avoid knight-move adjacency, and print counts of such sets for different sizes, up to size 31, to help conjecture the maximum size.

Due to the problem's complexity, I'll:
- sample points in an 8×8 grid,
- generate subsets avoiding the knight-move adjacency,
- print counts for specific subset sizes.

Here's the code:

```python
import itertools

# Generate all points in the 8x8 grid
points = [(i, j) for i in range(8) for j in range(8)]

# Precompute "knight-move" adjacency
knight_moves = [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2),
                (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]

adj = {}
for p in points:
    neighbors = []
    for dx, dy in knight_moves:
        x, y = p[0] + dx, p[1] + dy
        if 0 <= x < 8 and 0 <= y < 8:
            neighbors.append((x, y))
    adj[p] = neighbors

# Generate all subsets avoiding knight-move pairs (independent sets)
# Due to combinatorial explosion, test subsets of specific sizes
max_size = 31
counts = {}

# For small sizes, generate random or heuristic subsets
# Here, for demonstration, we attempt to find maximum independent sets by heuristic
# Note: this is a simplified approach; full enumeration is infeasible here

# Let's assemble a greedy maximal independent set
selected = set()
used = set()

for p in points:
    if p not in used:
        # Check if p conflicts with selected
        if all(n not in selected for n in adj[p]):
            selected.add(p)
            used.update(adj[p] + [p])

# Result: size of the greedy independent set
max_indep_size = len(selected)

print("Maximum independent set size (heuristic):", max_indep_size)

# Now, attempt to count how many such sets of size 31 exist based on heuristic
# For demonstration, print if size 31 is achievable
if max_indep_size >= 31:
    print("Found a set of size 31 avoiding knight moves.")
else:
    print("No such set of size 31 found via heuristic.")

# For more detailed counts, a full enumeration or backtracking would be needed.
# Here, just print the heuristic result for further conjecture.
```

This code is resource-limited and heuristic-driven, providing an initial estimate of whether a 31-sized subset avoiding knight-move adjacency exists, and an approximate maximum size of such independent sets. It supports conjecture about the maximal subset size and combinatorial constraints in the grid.
