This problem deals with characterizing functions \( f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) satisfying the functional equation:
\[
f(f(f(n))) = f(n+1) + 1 \quad \forall n \in \mathbb{N}.
\]
Our goal seems to be to find all such functions or at least to conjecture their form. To assist, we will attempt to enumerate candidate functions for small \( n \) and explore their properties, especially considering simple patterns and possible recursive structures.

Given the complexity, we will try small functions with simple rules (linear, polynomial, or constant pattern) for initial values, test whether they satisfy the relation, and print the results as we go. Since the problem appears highly nontrivial, and advanced reasoning is required, we focus on straightforward candidate enumeration and partial verification.

Here's the approach:
- Generate candidate functions for small domains (say, up to 10).
- Use simple functional forms (constant, linear with small slopes).
- Check the functional equation.
- Stream results as soon as potential candidates are found.

This will help in formulating conjectures about the structure of solutions.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions f: N -> N with small values for initial inputs
# Check the relation f(f(f(n))) = f(n+1) + 1 for n in [0..9]
# Print candidates that satisfy the relation for as many n as feasible

def check_function(f, max_n=10):
    for n in range(max_n):
        if f(f(f(n))) != f(n+1) + 1:
            return False
    return True

# Generate candidate functions: start with simple linear forms f(n) = a*n + b
# For small a, b in small range, and test
results = []

for a in range(1, 4):  # small slopes
    for b in range(0, 4):  # small intercepts
        def f(n, a=a, b=b):
            return a * n + b
        if check_function(f):
            print(f"Candidate f(n) = {a}*n + {b} satisfies the relation.")
            results.append(f)

# Also check constant functions f(n) = c
for c in range(0, 4):
    def f_const(n, c=c):
        return c
    if check_function(f_const):
        print(f"Constant f(n) = {c} satisfies the relation.")

# Attempt to find functions with small piecewise or recursive forms
# For brevity, focus on small candidates and report found solutions
# The code can be extended to try more complex forms if needed
```
