This problem appears to involve solving a system of equations with constraints involving points (x, y). The equations given are:

1. \( x^2 + y^2 = 6 y - 4 x + 12 \)
2. \( 4 y = x^2 + 4 x + 12 \)

Our goal is to find all solutions (x, y) satisfying both. To assist in conjecturing and proving, we'll implement a Python script to enumerate candidate solutions within a reasonable bounded domain. Since the equations are quadratic, the solutions should be finite.

We'll:
- Express y from the second equation.
- Substitute into the first to find x's solutions.
- Evaluate and print solutions as they are found.

Ensuring code efficiency:
- Use small sampling ranges.
- Solve algebraically where possible.
- Avoid unnecessary calculations.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumeration of solutions to system:
# x^2 + y^2 = 6 y - 4 x + 12
# 4 y = x^2 + 4 x + 12
# We'll solve for y from second, substitute into first.

import sympy as sp

x_sym, y_sym = sp.symbols('x y')

# From second eq: y = (x^2 + 4 x + 12)/4
# Substitute into first:
# x^2 + ((x^2 + 4 x + 12)/4)^2 = 6 * ((x^2 + 4 x + 12)/4) - 4 x + 12

def enumerate_solutions():
    solutions = set()
    # Sample x in a small range
    for x_val in [i / 10 for i in range(-50, 51)]:  # x in [-5, 5]
        # Compute y from second equation
        y_expr = (x_val**2 + 4 * x_val + 12) / 4
        # Verify first equation
        lhs = x_val**2 + y_expr**2
        rhs = 6 * y_expr - 4 * x_val + 12
        if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-4:
            solutions.add((round(x_val, 4), round(y_expr, 4)))
            print(f"Solution found: x={x_val:.4f}, y={y_expr:.4f}")
    # Return all solutions
    return solutions

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_solutions()
```
