This problem involves finding a 4-digit number N between 1000 and 9999 such that changing any digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7, and N is the greatest such number. The key is that for each digit position i, the number N with its i-th digit replaced by 1 must be divisible by 7.

For efficiency and to narrow down candidates, I'll:
- Sample small values for N.
- Check all possible N in the high range, specifically starting from the known expression 9999 - (9999 % 7 - 1).
- For each N, verify the digit-transform property.
- Record the maximum N found.

Here's the plan:
- Focus on the number N = 9999 - (9999 % 7 - 1). This ensures N is close to 9999 and satisfies the modular condition.
- Iterate over N values around that, decreasing to find the greatest N satisfying the property.
- For each candidate, check each digit's modification condition.

The program will produce answers in real-time, streaming candidate Ns and finally output the greatest answer.

```python
# Enumerate candidate N starting from the given number 
# and decreasing until find the maximum satisfying the condition.
# Reasoning: the maximum N is around 9999 for this problem.

def check_property(N):
    for i in range(4):
        digit = (N // 10**i) % 10
        modified = N - digit * 10**i + 1 * 10**i
        if modified % 7 != 0:
            return False
    return True

# Starting point as given in the theorem: N = 9999 - (9999 % 7 - 1)
start_N = 9999 - (9999 % 7 - 1)
max_N = start_N
found = False

# Search downward for the greatest N satisfying the property
for N in range(start_N, 999, -1):
    if check_property(N):
        print(N)  # Stream each candidate immediately upon verifying
        max_N = N
        found = True
        break

print("Maximum N satisfying the property:", max_N)
```
