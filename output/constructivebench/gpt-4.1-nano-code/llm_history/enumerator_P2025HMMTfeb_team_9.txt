[write_program]
The problem appears to be about identifying prime numbers \( p \) for which there exists a function \( f : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \) satisfying certain periodicity and congruence conditions. Since the formal code contains placeholders (`sorry`), I'll interpret the conditions:

- \( p \) is prime.
- \( f \) is \( p \)-periodic (\( f(x + p) = f(x) \) for all \( x \)).
- For all \( x \), \( (f(x + f(x)) - x) \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \).

I will implement a Python program that searches for primes \( p \) within a small range (say, 2 to 30) and attempts to find functions \( f \) with simple, bounded representations satisfying the conditions for each \( p \).

Approach:
- For each prime candidate \( p \), enumerate possible functions \( f \) over the finite set \(\{0, 1, ..., p-1\}\) (since \( f \) is \( p \)-periodic).
- For each candidate \( f \), try to check if for all \( x \in \mathbb{Z} \), the condition on \( f \) holds. Since \( f \) is \( p \)-periodic, it's enough to verify the condition over \( x \) in \( 0,..., p-1 \), because the condition extends by periodicity.

The code will output the prime \( p \) if such a function exists.

```python
import itertools

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Search range for p
primes = [p for p in range(2, 31) if is_prime(p)]

for p in primes:
    found = False
    # f is defined on {0,1,..., p-1}
    domain = range(p)
    # Generate all possible functions f: {0,..., p-1} -> {0,..., p-1}
    for values in itertools.product(domain, repeat=p):
        f = list(values)
        # Check the condition for all x in {0, ..., p-1}
        # since f is p-periodic, this suffices
        valid = True
        for x in domain:
            f_x = f[x]
            # Compute f(x + f(x)) mod p
            y = (x + f_x) % p
            f_y = f[y]
            # Check if (f(x + f(x)) - x) % p == 0
            if (f_y - x) % p != 0:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            print(f"Prime p = {p} admits a function f satisfying the conditions.")
            print(f"f (on 0,...,{p-1}): {f}")
            found = True
    if found:
        # We stop at first such p for demonstration (or can continue to find all)
        pass
```
