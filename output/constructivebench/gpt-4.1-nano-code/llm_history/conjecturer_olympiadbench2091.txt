The problem seeks the maximal N such that there are N distinct triples summing to n with all coordinates unique across triples. The maximum N corresponds to the count of all possible triples with sum n, where each coordinate is distinct. For a fixed n, the largest N is achieved when triples are composed of distinct positive integers summing to n, i.e., the number of partitions of n into three distinct parts.

Since the number of such triples roughly correlates to the counts of partitions into three distinct parts, the maximum N is about the integer division of (n-1)(n-2)/2 for n ≥ 3, scaled to fit the pattern observed:

<<<fun n => (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 2>>>
