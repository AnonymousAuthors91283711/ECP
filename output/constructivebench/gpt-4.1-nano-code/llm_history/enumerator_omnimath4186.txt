The problem involves characterizing functions \(f, g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying a specific functional equation, and the answer depends on a parameter \(t \in \mathbb{R}\). The goal is to enumerate possible solutions by sampling small values of \(t\) and checking the resulting functions.

Since the problem refers to a noncomputable definition `omnimath4186_answer(t)`, which likely provides candidate solutions parametrized by \(t\), we will simulate this definitional enumeration for a small range of \(t\) values (e.g., integers from -3 to 3). We will print candidate functions \(f\) and \(g\) for these parameter values.

Note: As the original code is in Lean with an unspecified `sorry`, the Python code will treat `omnimath4186_answer(t)` as a placeholder generating a pair of functions. For demonstration, we'll generate sample functions parameterized by \(t\) as linear or simple polynomials, assuming the typical solutions for such functional equations.

```python
# The following code samples small values of t, constructs hypothetical candidate functions f and g,
# and prints them. This helps in conjecturing the solutions set for the functional equation.

def generate_candidate_functions(t):
    # Example parametrized functions based on t, inferred from typical functional equations:
    # For illustration: f(x) = a * x + b, g(x) = c * x + d, with coefficients depending on t.
    # These are hypothetical and meant for enumeration purposes.
    a = t + 1
    b = t - 1
    c = -t
    d = t + 2
    def f(x):
        return a * x + b
    def g(x):
        return c * x + d
    return f, g

def print_function(name, func):
    # Print function as a string for small integer inputs
    values = [func(x) for x in range(-3, 4)]
    print(f"{name}(x) for x in [-3..3]: {values}")

# Enumerate t values from -3 to 3
for t in range(-3, 4):
    f, g = generate_candidate_functions(t)
    print(f"t = {t}")
    print_function("f", f)
    print_function("g", g)
    print("-" * 40)
```
