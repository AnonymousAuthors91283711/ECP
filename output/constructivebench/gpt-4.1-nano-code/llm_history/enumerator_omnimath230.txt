This problem examines a finite set \( S \subseteq \mathbb{N} \) where each element satisfies a special property related to gcds and divisors. Specifically, for each \( s \in S \), the set of divisors \( d > 0 \) of \( s \) corresponds to *exactly one* element \( t \in S \) such that \( \gcd(s, t) = d \). The goal is to determine possible values of \( |S| \).

**Approach:**
- Since the problem involves divisors and gcds, start by considering small finite sets, such as \( |S|=1, 2, 3 \).
- For each case, enumerate all small candidate sets \( S \), checking the condition.
- Focus on small numbers, \( S \subseteq \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10,\dots\} \), to avoid large computations.
- For each \( s \), verify the existence and uniqueness of \( t \) for every divisor \( d \).

This enumeration prioritizes the possible set sizes and avoids large searches. The task is to identify the potential sizes \( |S| \) can take under the constraints.

```python
# The program enumerates small candidate sets S of natural numbers,
# verifying the given gcd-divisor uniqueness condition.
# It then reports possible sizes of such S.

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def check_condition(S):
    for s in S:
        divisors = [d for d in range(1, s+1) if s % d == 0]
        for d in divisors:
            # Find all t in S with gcd(s, t) = d
            t_candidates = [t for t in S if gcd(s, t) == d]
            if len(t_candidates) != 1:
                return False
    return True

possible_sizes = set()

# Small candidate sets, enumerated by size and content
# We limit to sets with elements <= 10 for efficiency
from itertools import combinations, chain

elements = range(1, 11)

# Check for sets of size 1
for s in combinations(elements, 1):
    s_set = set(s)
    if check_condition(s_set):
        possible_sizes.add(len(s_set))

# Check for sets of size 2 to 4 for demonstration
for size in range(2, 5):
    for s in combinations(elements, size):
        s_set = set(s)
        if check_condition(s_set):
            possible_sizes.add(len(s_set))

# Output all possible sizes found
for size in sorted(possible_sizes):
    print(size)
```
