Ground Truth Answer: 64
Proposed Answer: 16
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. This is a classic inclusion-exclusion problem involving three sets (singers, dancers, actors) with given complement sizes and a constraint that no student is in all three sets.

2. Given:
   - Total students = 100
   - Non-singers = 42 ⇒ Singers = 58
   - Non-dancers = 65 ⇒ Dancers = 35
   - Non-actors = 29 ⇒ Actors = 71
   - No student is in all three sets

3. We need to find the size of the union of pairwise intersections (S∩D) ∪ (S∩A) ∪ (D∩A).

4. Using inclusion-exclusion principles:
   - |S∪D∪A| = |S| + |D| + |A| - |S∩D| - |S∩A| - |D∩A| (since |S∩D∩A| = 0)
   - We can find |S∪D∪A| = 100 - |Sᶜ∩Dᶜ∩Aᶜ|, but we don't have this information directly
   - The ground truth answer 64 is correct based on standard solutions to such problems

5. The proposed answer 16 is incorrect - it's too small and doesn't match the expected calculation.
