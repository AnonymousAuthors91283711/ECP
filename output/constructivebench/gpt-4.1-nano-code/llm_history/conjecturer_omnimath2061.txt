  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (n + 1 : ℚ) / (2 * n + 1) < 1 / 100} omnimath2061_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No n > 0 satisfies the inequality.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the enumerate statement, no positive integer n satisfies the inequality, implying the set of such n is empty. The least element of an empty set in ℕ defaults to 0 (by convention, or no such n exists). Therefore, the answer is 0.
