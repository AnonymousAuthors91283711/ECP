  IsLeast {s : ℤ | ∃ (x : ℕ → ℤ),
    x 0 = 0 ∧
    (∀ k ≥ 1, |x k| = |x (k - 1) + 3|) ∧

    P2006AIMEI_15_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Minimum absolute sum for n=1: 3
Minimum absolute sum for n=2: 3
Minimum absolute sum for n=3: 0
Minimum absolute sum for n=4: 6
Minimum absolute sum for n=5: 3
Minimum absolute sum for n=6: 3
Minimum absolute sum for n=7: 6
Minimum absolute sum for n=8: 0
Minimum absolute sum for n=9: 9
Minimum absolute sum for n=10: 3. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The sequence's absolute value pattern suggests that the minimal sum alternates with zeros at odd steps divisible by 4 and other values by 3 or multiples of 3. The minimal sum over 2006 terms appears at positions where the sum equals 0, i.e., when n mod 4 = 3. Based on pattern and minimal values, the minimal sum is 0.
