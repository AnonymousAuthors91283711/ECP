  x * y = P2013AMCA_8_answer x y := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Possible product xy candidates: set(). Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
Since given the relation x + 2/x = y + 2/y, this implies x + 2/x = y + 2/y, leading to quadratic equations in x and y. The solutions to this symmetric relation suggest x y = 1. Therefore, the general closed form should be 1 for the product xy. 

Thus, the answer is:

<<<fun x y : ℝ => 1>>>
