theorem omnimath4162 (a b n p : ℕ) (hp : Nat.Prime p) :
  2^a + p^b = n^(p-1) ↔ (a, b, n, p) ∈ omnimath4162_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(3, 0, 3, 3)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b, n, p) | p=2 ∧ n = b + 2^(a-1) + 1} ∪ {(4, 2, 5, 3)}
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The ground truth answer only includes one specific solution: (3, 0, 3, 3)
2. The proposed answer includes:
   - All solutions where p=2 with a specific form
   - Plus one additional solution (4, 2, 5, 3)

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It includes many solutions not in the ground truth
- The additional solution (4, 2, 5, 3) doesn't match the ground truth (3, 0, 3, 3)
- The p=2 case isn't part of the ground truth solution

<<<False>>>
