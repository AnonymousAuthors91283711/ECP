[write_program]
The problem appears to be a formal theorem statement involving finite sets, sumsets, and a maximal property on certain collections of 2-element subsets within the interval [1, 2018]. To assist, I'll implement a Python program that enumerates all possible 2-element subsets within a small sample space (say, [1..5]) for manageable computation, checking when the sumsets are identical to explore structural properties. Based on the enumerations, the goal is likely to identify the largest such collection with the described sumset uniqueness property.

The key is:
- Fix small parameters (e.g., n up to 3 or 4),
- Generate all 2-element subsets within [1..5],
- For each collection of subsets, check if the sumset structure meets the uniqueness criteria,
- Print each candidate immediately for the partial results,
- Finally, identify the maximal collection under these constraints.

```python
from itertools import combinations, chain

# Generate all 2-element subsets within [1..5]
all_pairs = list(combinations(range(1, 6), 2))

# Function to compute sumset of a collection of subsets
def sumset_of_collection(collection):
    sumsets = set()
    for A in collection:
        for B in collection:
            # sumset of individual pairs
            sumset = {a + b for a in A for b in B}
            sumsets.add(frozenset(sumset))
    return sumsets

# Enumerate all collections of pairs
max_size = 0
best_collections = []

# Generate all subsets of all_pairs
for r in range(len(all_pairs) + 1):
    for collection in combinations(all_pairs, r):
        # Check sumset uniqueness condition
        sumsets = set()
        valid = True
        for i, A in enumerate(collection):
            for j, B in enumerate(collection):
                # For all pairs (i,j), check sumset
                sset = frozenset({a + b for a in A for b in B})
                if sset in sumsets:
                    # If sumset already seen with different indices, violate uniqueness
                    # But the problem states equality implies equality of indices
                    # Here, as a simplification, we check if any sumset repeats
                    valid = False
                    break
                sumsets.add(sset)
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            print("Valid collection with size", len(collection), ":", collection)
            if len(collection) > max_size:
                max_size = len(collection)
                best_collections = [collection]
            elif len(collection) == max_size:
                best_collections.append(collection)

print(f"\nMaximum collection size: {max_size}")
print("Examples of maximal collections:")
for col in best_collections:
    print(col)
```
