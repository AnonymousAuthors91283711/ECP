This appears to be a formal theorem statement possibly related to topology or real analysis involving two real numbers with specific conditions. Since the problem is to enumerate answers for a high-school level problem, I'll interpret the goal as trying to find pairs \( (a_0, a_1) \) with certain properties under the assumptions given, and to code an enumeration to assist in conjecture.

Given the constraints:
- \( a_0 \neq a_1 \)
- \( a_0 > 0 \)
- \( a_1 > 0 \)

I will write code that enumerates pairs \((a_0, a_1)\) with small rational or integer values satisfying these conditions, and for each, tests some simple property, printing the answers immediately for hypothesis generation.

Here's a minimal code snippet that:
- Sets small ranges for \(a_0, a_1\),
- Ensures they are positive and distinct,
- Prints the pairs immediately,
- Can be extended to test properties or hypotheses related to the problem's goal, which isn't fully specified here, so I'll do a basic enumeration.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (a0, a1) with small positive values, a0 != a1, for conjectural analysis
for a0 in range(1, 6):  # small positive integers
    for a1 in range(1, 6):
        if a1 != a0:
            print(f"a0={a0}, a1={a1}")
```
