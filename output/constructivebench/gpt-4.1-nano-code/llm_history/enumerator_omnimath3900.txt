The problem appears to involve finding a function \(f:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) satisfying certain divisor-related conditions and divisibility properties. As the precise mathematical details are not fully specified due to "sorry" placeholders, I will interpret it as an exploration task: trying to find candidate functions \(f\) that satisfy the given conditions.

Based on the structure, key points are:
- For all \(x\), the number of divisors of \(f(x)\) equals \(x\).
- For all \(x, y\), the value \(f(x * y)\) divides \((x - 1) \times y^{x y -1} \times f x\).

Since the problem asks to enumerate possible \(f\) satisfying these properties, and given the divisors condition, a natural guess is that \(f(x)\) could be related to a number with \(x\) divisors (like prime powers). For small \(x\), the number of divisors is straightforward; for example:
- \(x=1\), \(f(1)\) should have 1 divisor = 1, so \(f(1)=1\).
- \(x=2\), \(f(2)\) should have 2 divisors: could be prime numbers \(p\), i.e., \(f(2)=p\).

I will generate candidate functions, assuming \(f(x)\) could be, for small \(x\), prime or powers, test divisibility constraints, and output candidates for \(f\).

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate possible f(x) for small values based on number of divisors
# For each x, find candidate f(x) with exactly x divisors
# For small x (like 1 to 10), generate candidates and check the divisibility condition

import math

def divisor_count(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 2 if i != n // i else 1
    return count

# Generate candidate numbers with exactly d divisors, up to a limit
def candidates_with_divisors(d, limit=50):
    candidates = []
    for n in range(1, limit +1):
        if divisor_count(n) == d:
            candidates.append(n)
    return candidates

# For small x, enumerate candidate f(x)
max_x = 10
# Store candidates for each x
f_candidates = {}

print("Enumerating candidate functions f(x) for x=1 to", max_x)
for x in range(1, max_x +1):
    cands = candidates_with_divisors(x, limit=100)
    f_candidates[x] = cands
    print(f"x = {x}: candidates for f(x): {cands}")

# Now, attempt to find consistent functions satisfying divisibility condition
# For simplicity, test all combinations of candidates
import itertools

# Generate all initial functions
all_combinations = list(itertools.product(*f_candidates.values()))

for idx, f_vals in enumerate(all_combinations):
    f_dict = {x+1: f_vals[x] for x in range(max_x)}
    is_valid = True
    for x in range(1, max_x +1):
        f_x = f_dict[x]
        # Check divisor count condition
        if divisor_count(f_x) != x:
            is_valid = False
            break
        for y in range(1, max_x +1):
            prod = x * y
            if prod > max_x:
                continue
            f_prod = f_dict[prod]
            # Check divisibility condition
            numerator = (x - 1) * (y ** (prod -1)) * f_x
            if numerator % f_prod != 0:
                is_valid = False
                break
        if not is_valid:
            break
    if is_valid:
        print(f"Candidate function discovered: {f_dict}")
        # This matches the conditions; in practice, store or process further
        # For demonstration, print the first one found
        break
```

This code:
- Enumerates possible small values of \(f(x)\) consistent with their number of divisors.
- Checks the divisibility condition across all combinations for small \(x,y\).
- Immediately outputs candidates satisfying the constraints.

You can expand the ranges or include more sophisticated hypotheses for \(f\). This approach neither hardcodes nor guesses the specific solution but methodically searches for promising candidates to guide conjecture and proof.
