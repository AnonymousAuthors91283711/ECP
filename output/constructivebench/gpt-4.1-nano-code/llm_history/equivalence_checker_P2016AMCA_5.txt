  Even n ∧ n > 2 ∧ ¬∃ (p q : ℕ), p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ p + q = n ↔ n ∈ P2016AMCA_5_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | Even n ∧ n > 2 ∧ ∀ (p q : ℕ), p.Prime → q.Prime → p + q ≠ n}
Proposed Answer: { n : ℕ | 2 < n ∧ Even n ∧ ¬∃ p q : ℕ, p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ p + q = n }
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer:

1. Both answers require n to be even (Even n)
2. Both answers require n > 2 (ground truth uses n > 2, proposed uses 2 < n - these are identical)
3. Both answers express that n cannot be expressed as a sum of two primes:
   - Ground truth uses ∀ (p q : ℕ), p.Prime → q.Prime → p + q ≠ n
   - Proposed uses ¬∃ p q : ℕ, p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ p + q = n

The two forms of expressing the non-existence of prime pairs are logically equivalent:
- ∀x, ¬P(x) is equivalent to ¬∃x, P(x) (universal quantification of negation vs negation of existential)
- The conditions inside the quantifiers are identical (just written in different order)

The only difference is the order of conditions in the set definition, which doesn't affect the meaning.
