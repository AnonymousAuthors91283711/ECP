The problem appears to involve the set of natural numbers \( n \) with the properties: \( 0 < n < 1000 \), and there exists a real number \( x \) such that \( 0 < x \) and \( n = x \cdot \lfloor x \rfloor \). The goal is to enumerate possible values of \( n \) satisfying this.

Key insight:
- For each \( n \), find \( x > 0 \) such that \( n = x \lfloor x \rfloor \).
- Let \( k = \lfloor x \rfloor \), then \( n = x \cdot k \) implies \( x = n / k \).
- Since \( x \geq 0 \) and \( x = n/k \), we need \( x \geq 1 \) if \( k \geq 1 \) (because \( x \geq 0 \) and \( \lfloor x \rfloor = k \)).

Conditions:
- \( k \geq 1 \)
- \( x = n/k \)
- \( \lfloor x \rfloor = k \Rightarrow k \leq x < k+1 \Rightarrow k \leq n/k < k+1 \)

Therefore, for each \( n \):
- For each \( k \in 1 \) to \( n \):
  - Check if \( n/k \) satisfies \( k \leq n/k < k+1 \)

Given \( n/k \geq k \Rightarrow n \geq k^2 \),
and \( n/k < k+1 \Rightarrow n < k(k+1) \).

So for each \( n \),
- For each \( k \) with \( k^2 \leq n < k(k+1) \),
  - \( x = n/k \),
  - \( \lfloor x \rfloor = k \),
  - \( n = x \cdot \lfloor x \rfloor \) holds.

Implementation:
- Iterate \( n \) from 1 to 999.
- For each \( n \), check \( k \) from 1 to \( \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor + 1 \) (since \( k^2 \leq n \)).

Now, let's implement this reasoning:

```python
# Enumerate n in [1, 999] satisfying the condition
answers = set()
for n in range(1, 1000):
    max_k = int(n**0.5) + 2  # +2 to cover boundary cases
    for k in range(1, max_k):
        if k * k <= n < k * (k + 1):
            # n = x * k, with x = n / k, and should satisfy floor(x) = k
            x = n / k
            if int(x) == k:
                # Confirming that floor(x) is indeed k
                answers.add(n)
                print(n)
                break
# Final output is the set of all such n's
```

This script enumerates all \( n < 1000 \) with the specified property, effectively finding all solutions.
