This problem involves finding the least natural number \(x > 0\) for which there exists a positive \(y\) such that \(\frac{1}{32} = \frac{x}{10^y}\). We want to enumerate potential candidates for \(x\) and \(y\) satisfying this equation.

Since \(\frac{1}{32} = \frac{x}{10^y}\), this implies \(x = \frac{10^y}{32}\). For \(x\) to be a natural number, \(10^y\) must be divisible by 32. Because \(10^y = 2^y \times 5^y\), and 32 divides \(10^y\) iff \(2^5\) divides \(10^y\), meaning \(y \geq 5\). For each such \(y\), \(x = \frac{10^y}{32}\).

We will enumerate \(y\) starting from 5 upwards, computing \(x\), and checking if it's an integer. We will stop once \(x\) exceeds some reasonable threshold (since the problem asks for the least such \(x\)).

```python
# Enumerate y starting from 5 upwards
# Compute x = 10^y / 32, check if integer, print when it is
# Since 10^y = 2^y * 5^y, divisibility by 32 (2^5) requires y >=5

threshold_y = 20  # arbitrary upper limit for search
results = []

for y in range(5, threshold_y + 1):
    numerator = 10 ** y
    if numerator % 32 == 0:
        x = numerator // 32
        print(f"y = {y}, x = {x}")
        results.append(x)
# Output the minimal x found
if results:
    min_x = min(results)
    print(f"Minimum x satisfying conditions: {min_x}")
```
