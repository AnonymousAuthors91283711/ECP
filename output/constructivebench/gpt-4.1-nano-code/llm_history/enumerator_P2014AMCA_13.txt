This problem appears to be about counting functions from a finite set (of size 5) to itself, with the condition that for each y in the codomain, the preimage {x | f x = y} has size at most 2. The goal is likely to find the total number of such functions.

Let's analyze the scenario:

- The set is `Fin 5`, which has 5 elements.
- For each y, the preimage size is at most 2.
- Counting all functions f : Fin 5 → Fin 5 where for every y, the set {x | f x = y} has size ≤ 2.

To enumerate possible answers, consider how the domain maps under such a function:

- For each y, the preimage can be of size 0, 1, or 2.
- The total preimage sizes sum to 5, the size of the domain.
- Possible preimage size distributions:
  - For example, one y with preimage size 2, and three y's with size 1, and one y with size 0 (since total is 5).

The enumeration:

1. For each distribution of preimage sizes summing to 5, with each size ≤ 2.
2. For each such distribution, count the number of functions consistent with it, i.e., the assignments of domain elements to each y, respecting their preimage sizes.

Let's write code that:

- Enumerates all distributions of preimage sizes summing to 5, each ≤ 2.
- For each, counts the number of functions (multinomial coefficient times arrangements).

The key steps:

- Generate all combinations of preimage sizes (`counts`) with values in {0,1,2} summing to 5.
- For each counts pattern, compute the number of functions: multinomial coefficient times arrangements.

Note: Since the preimages are about the domain elements assigned to each y, the number of functions is:

\[ \frac{5!}{\prod_{y} (size_y!)} \]

But because we're counting functions where for each y, the preimage has size specified, and the domain is partitioned accordingly, the total is sum over such partitions, summing multinomials over possible distributions.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate all preimage size distributions with each size ≤ 2 summing to 5
# For each distribution, count the number of functions

from itertools import combinations_with_replacement, permutations

def generate_distributions(total, max_size, length):
    # Generate all non-decreasing sequences of length 'length' with elements ≤ max_size summing to total
    def backtrack(remaining, start, current):
        if len(current) == length:
            if remaining == 0:
                yield current
            return
        for size in range(start, max_size + 1):
            if size <= remaining:
                yield from backtrack(remaining - size, size, current + [size])
    return backtrack(total, 0, [])

total_preimages = 5
max_preimage_size = 2
domain_size = 5
num_elements = domain_size

answers = []

for distribution in generate_distributions(total_preimages, max_preimage_size, 5):
    # distribution is a list of preimage sizes, sum to 5, each ≤ 2
    # Count the number of functions compatible with this distribution

    # Number of ways to assign domain elements to preimages
    # is multinomial coefficient: 5! / (prod of preimage size factorials)
    numerator = 1
    for size in distribution:
        numerator *= 1  # will do factorials later
    from math import factorial
    denom = 1
    for size in distribution:
        denom *= factorial(size)
    count_assignments = factorial(5) // denom

    # For each distribution, produce the total count
    answers.append(count_assignments)
    print(count_assignments)
```

This code enumerates all valid distributions of preimage sizes summing to 5 with each size ≤ 2, calculates the number of functions for each distribution, and prints the count immediately as it proceeds.

```python
from math import factorial

def generate_distributions(total, max_size, length):
    def backtrack(remaining, start, current):
        if len(current) == length:
            if remaining == 0:
                yield current
            return
        for size in range(start, max_size + 1):
            if size <= remaining:
                yield from backtrack(remaining - size, size, current + [size])
    return backtrack(total, 0, [])

total_preimages = 5
max_preimage_size = 2
domain_size = 5

for distribution in generate_distributions(total_preimages, max_preimage_size, domain_size):
    denom = 1
    for size in distribution:
        denom *= factorial(size)
    count = factorial(domain_size) // denom
    print(count)
```
This program enumerates all valid counts of functions satisfying the preimage size condition, streaming each as it is computed.
