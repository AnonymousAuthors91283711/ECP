Ground Truth Answer: 1/3
Proposed Answer: (4 : ℝ) / 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the greatest value of an infinite series ∑(cos θ')ⁿ where θ' satisfies sin θ' = √(T²-64)/T with T=32.

2. First, calculate √(T²-64)/T when T=32:
   √(32²-64)/32 = √(1024-64)/32 = √960/32 ≈ 30.984/32 ≈ 0.96825

3. Since sin θ' ≈ 0.96825, we can find cos θ':
   cos θ' = √(1 - sin² θ') ≈ √(1 - 0.96825²) ≈ √(1 - 0.9375) ≈ √0.0625 ≈ 0.25

4. The infinite series ∑(cos θ')ⁿ is a geometric series with ratio r = cos θ' ≈ 0.25
   Its sum is 1/(1-r) = 1/(1-0.25) = 1/0.75 = 4/3

5. The ground truth answer is 1/3, while the proposed answer is 4/3.

The proposed answer (4/3) appears to be correct based on this calculation, while the ground truth answer (1/3) seems incorrect.
