This problem appears to be about a mathematical conjecture involving variables x and y, with y = x^2, and the condition y - x = 3 - y, which simplifies to 2y = x + 3. We are asked to find the greatest value of s = x + y under these conditions.

Let's analyze the constraints:
1. y = x^2
2. y - x = 3 - y → 2y = x + 3
3. s = x + y

From 2, rewrite as y = (x + 3)/2. But from 1, y = x^2. Equate these:
x^2 = (x + 3)/2 → 2x^2 = x + 3 → 2x^2 - x - 3 = 0

Solve this quadratic:
Discriminant D = 1^2 - 4 * 2 * (-3) = 1 + 24 = 25

Solutions:
x = [1 ± √25] / (2 * 2) = [1 ± 5] / 4

x = (1 + 5)/4 = 6/4 = 3/2

x = (1 - 5)/4 = -4/4 = -1

Corresponding y:
For x=3/2:
y= (x+3)/2 = (3/2 + 3)/2 = (3/2 + 6/2)/2 = (9/2)/2 = 9/4

s = x + y = (3/2) + (9/4) = (6/4) + (9/4) = 15/4 = 3.75

For x= -1:
y= (-1 + 3)/2 = 2/2=1

s= -1 +1=0

Between these two, the greatest s is 15/4.

Now, let's implement Python code to verify and find the maximum s over these solutions, enumerating candidates as per instructions.

```python
# Enumerate the solutions explicitly computed: x-values of 3/2 and -1, corresponding y-values.
# Calculate s = x + y for each, outputting each result as found.

solutions = [
    (3/2, (3/2 + 3)/2),  # x = 3/2, y = (x + 3)/2
    (-1, (-1 + 3)/2)     # x = -1, y = (x + 3)/2
]

for x, y in solutions:
    s = x + y
    print(f"Solution with x={x}, y={y}, s={s}")
```
This code outputs the candidate solutions immediately, helping conjecture that the maximum is 15/4.
