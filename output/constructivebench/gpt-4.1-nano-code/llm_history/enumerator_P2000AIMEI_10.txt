This problem involves finding a unique function \( x: \text{Fin } 100 \to \mathbb{Q} \) satisfying the relation \( x_k = \left(\sum_{i=0}^{99} x_i\right) - x_k - k \), with the specific value \( x_{49} \) determined or related to a particular answer. Based on the given relation, we can analyze or attempt to generate solutions by parameterizing the sum and iteratively solving for \( x_k \). 

Since the problem asks to find the value of \( x_{49} \) (or an answer related to it), let's write code that:
- Assigns a sample total sum \( S = \sum_{i=0}^{99} x_i \), varies \( S \),
- Iterates over possible values of \( x_{49} \),
- Determines corresponding \( x_i \) for all \( i \),
- Prints solutions whenever the conditions are satisfied.

Given the symmetry, the key relation simplifies to:
\[
x_k = S - x_k - k \implies 2x_k = S - k \implies x_k = \frac{S - k}{2}
\]
for all \( k \), which suggests that all \( x_k \) are determined by \( S \). The sum over all \( x_k \) then yields:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{99} x_k = \sum_{k=0}^{99} \frac{S - k}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \left( 100 S - \sum_{k=0}^{99} k \right)
\]
Since \(\sum_{k=0}^{99} k = \frac{99 \times 100}{2} = 4950\),
\[
S = \frac{1}{2} (100 S - 4950) \implies 2 S = 100 S - 4950 \implies 98 S = 4950 \implies S = \frac{4950}{98} = \frac{2475}{49}
\]
This is the unique consistent total sum \( S \).

Now, reading the instructions for enumeration, since the explicit formula is derived, we will check this \( S \), then output \( x_{49} = (S - 49)/2 \).

Here's the implementation:

```python
# Enumerate possible solutions based on parameter S
# From derivation, the sum S = 4950/98 = 2475/49 (a fixed rational)
S_numerator = 4950
S_denominator = 98

# Simplify the fraction for S
from math import gcd
g = gcd(S_numerator, S_denominator)
S_num = S_numerator // g
S_den = S_denominator // g

# Calculate x_49 based on the sum S
x_49_numerator = S_num - 49 * S_den
x_49_denominator = 2 * S_den

# Simplify x_49
g_x = gcd(x_49_numerator, x_49_denominator)
x_49_num = x_49_numerator // g_x
x_49_den = x_49_denominator // g_x

# Output the exact value as a fraction
print(f"x_49 = {x_49_num}/{x_49_den}")
```
