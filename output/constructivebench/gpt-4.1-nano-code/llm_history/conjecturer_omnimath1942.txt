The problem involves the subset of pairs in a 5×5 grid where four corner sum mod 2 equals 1, and we seek the greatest n of such configurations. Since the sum of four corner entries mod 2 can be either 0 or 1, the maximum n is achieved when all configurations satisfy the condition for some grid. The total arrangements involve considering the parity of sums across pairs of grid entries, which can be both even and odd, but the maximum occurs when the grid is chosen to produce many such configurations, with the maximum aligning with the full count of possible pairings. Therefore, the maximum n is 10, corresponding to the cardinality of such pairings. 

Answer:

<<<10>>>
