[write_program]
This problem appears to involve summations over ranges and manipulations of sums, likely aimed at finding a specific value related to the sums A and B. To assist in conjecturing the true answer, I will write a Python script that:

- Defines the sums explicitly.
- Enumerates possible values or computes directly (since the formulas are straightforward).
- Prints each candidate answer immediately.
- Compares A and B to compute their difference's absolute value.
- Since the question likely expects an integer difference, I will output the computed exact value.

Given the problem's structure, instead of brute-force, I'll directly compute A and B from the formulas, which are simple sums over finite ranges.

```python
# Enumerate sums A and B based on their formulas
def main():
    A = sum((2 * k + 1) * (2 * k + 2) + 39 for k in range(20))
    B = 1 + sum((2 * k + 2) * (2 * k + 3) + 38 * 39 for k in range(19))
    diff = abs(A - B)
    print(diff)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
