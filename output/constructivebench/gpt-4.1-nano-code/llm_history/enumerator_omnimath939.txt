The problem defines a theorem involving a product over a range, with log base (n - k) of (1/(k+2)), for n ≥ 2. To understand possible values of the expression, we can analyze small values of n and enumerate the partial products explicitly, as the exact ground truth isn't provided. Our goal is to generate candidate answers for various n ≥ 2, with small values (like n=2,3,4,...), and output the computed products.

Since the expression involves a product of logs, we can compute each product directly in Python for small n values, handling the log base change. We will iterate n from 2 up to, say, 6, compute the product, and print results as candidates.

```python
import math

def compute_product(n):
    product = 1.0
    for k in range(n - 1):
        base = n - k
        argument = 1 / (k + 2)
        # Compute log base (n - k) of 1/(k+2)
        log_value = math.log(argument) / math.log(base)
        product *= log_value
    return product

# Enumerate for n from 2 to 6
for n in range(2, 7):
    answer = compute_product(n)
    print(f"n={n}: product = {answer}")
```
