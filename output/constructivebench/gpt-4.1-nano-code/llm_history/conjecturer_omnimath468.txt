The equation x^3 - 8 = 16 * (x + 1)^{1/3} simplifies when considering the substitution y = (x + 1)^{1/3}. Rewriting, we get (x + 1)^{1/3} = t, so x = t^3 - 1, leading to x^3 - 8 = 16t. Substituting x: (t^3 - 1)^3 - 8 = 16t, which simplifies to a polynomial in t. The solutions for x correspond to roots of this polynomial. The form suggests the solutions are where x = t^3 - 1, with t satisfying t^3 - 1 = 2t, from the original equation after substitution. Solving t^3 - 2t - 1 = 0 gives the roots, corresponding to the real solutions for x.

The main issues in your current code involve incorrect syntax for defining the set and invalid reference to unknown identifiers which are meant to be parts of the set description. Also, the general idea is to characterize the solutions x as those where x = t^3 - 1, with t satisfying the cubic t^3 - 2t - 1 = 0. Since Lean supports defining sets via set-builder notation, and `t` satisfying a polynomial, a correct formalization would involve quantifying over `t` with `t` being real roots of that polynomial.

Given that, a presumed correct formulation for `omnimath468_answer` should be an explicitly constructed set comprising all real `x` such that there exists a real `t` satisfying `x = t^3 - 1` and `t^3 - 2 t - 1 = 0`. Since Lean facilitates this by specifying `x` such that there exists `t` with these properties, the corrected code would be:

```lean
<<< { x | ∃ t : ℝ, x = t^3 - 1 ∧ t^3 - 2 * t - 1 = 0 } >>>
```

This fix replaces the incorrect initial abbreviation and aligns with the algebraic insight that solutions are parameterized by the roots of the cubic polynomial. It directly reflects the solution set's structure, providing a clean, closed-form, and general description consistent with the derivation pattern.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error occurs because 'abbrev' definitions in Lean cannot be directly assigned a term wrapped in '<<< ... >>>' delimiters. Instead, we should define 'omnimath468_answer' explicitly using 'def' or assign it directly to the set without these delimiters.

Looking at the enumerated answer, it appears to define the set of all real numbers x for which there exists a real t satisfying two conditions: x equals t^3 - 1, and t satisfies the cubic polynomial t^3 - 2t - 1 = 0.

Given the context, and common patterns with such equations, it is reasonable to formulate the solution set as:

{x | ∃ t, x = t^3 - 1 ∧ t^3 - 2 t - 1 = 0}

This directly captures the set of x values obtained by plugging in roots t of the polynomial t^3 - 2 t - 1 = 0 into x = t^3 - 1.

Therefore, the corrected code in Lean should be:

def omnimath468_answer : Set ℝ := { x | ∃ t : ℝ, x = t^3 - 1 ∧ t^3 - 2 t - 1 = 0 }

Note that the '<<< ... >>>' delimiters are not used in Lean code syntax when defining such constants; they are only for parsing the answer in this context.

Hence, the final proposed answer in Lean is:

The problem involves an equation involving cube roots and polynomial expressions: x³ - 8 = 16 * (x + 1)^{1/3}. The goal is to find the set of real solutions to this equation and express it in Lean as omnimath468_answer.

The key insight is recognizing that (x + 1)^{1/3} is the cube root of (x+1), i.e., cbrt(x+1). Recasting the equation:

x³ - 8 = 16 * cbrt(x+1)

Observe that x³ - 8 = (x - 2)(x² + 2x + 4). At the same time, the right side involves linear scaling of a cube root, suggesting special values where the equation simplifies, such as x = 2.

Testing x = 2:

Left: 8 -8=0

Right: 16 * cbrt(3)

Not zero unless cbrt(3)=0, which is false. So x=2 is not a solution.

Solve algebraically:

Let y = cbrt(x+1)

then:

x³ -8 = 16 y

but x = y³ - 1, thus:

(x)^3 -8 = 16 y

=> (y^3 - 1)^3 -8 = 16 y

This is complicated, but generally, solutions are real when the radical expression matches polynomial roots.

Alternatively, notice that for solutions, the equation can be written as:

x³ - 8 = 16 * cbrt(x+1)

It is plausible that solutions involve points where x+1 is a perfect cube, simplifies cbrt(x+1), or arrangements where both sides equal.

Alternatively, trying particular values:

x = 0:

Left: 0 - 8 = -8

Right: 16 * cbrt(1) = 16*1=16

No, mismatch.

x=1:

Left: 1 - 8 = -7

Right:16 * cbrt(2) ≈ 16*1.26=~20.16

No.

x= -1:

Left: (-1)^3 -8 = -1-8 = -9

Right:16 * cbrt(0) = 0

No.

x=3:

Left: 27 -8=19

Right: 16 cbrt(4)=16*1.587=25.4

Close, but not equal.

x= -2:

Left: -8 -8 = -16

Right:16 cbrt(-1) = 16 * (-1)= -16

Matching! So x= -2 is a solution.

Similarly, check at x= -1.5:

Left: (-1.5)^3 -8≈ -3.375 -8= -11.375

Right:16 cbrt(-0.5)=16 * (-0.7937)≈ -12.7

Close, but not exact.

But focusing on exact solutions, x= -2 is a solution.

Note that at x= -2, x+1= -1, cbrt(-1) = -1, confirms the earlier calculation.

Similarly, at x= -8:

x+1= -7

cbrt(-7)= approximately -1.913

Left: (-8)^3 -8= -512 -8= -520

Right: 16 * (-1.913)= -30.6, no.

No.

Now, requiring more formal solution approaches; the key is the radical structure: the function:

f(x)= x^3 -8 - 16 (x+1)^{1/3}

We seek solutions to f(x)=0.

Note that f(x) is continuous and differentiable on ℝ.

From earlier trials, x=-2 is a root.

What about x=-1:

f(-1): (-1)^3 -8 - 16*(0) = -1-8= -9 ≠ 0.

At x=0:

f(0): -8-0=-8≠0.

At x= -3:

(-3)^3 -8= -27 -8= -35

Right: 16 cbrt(-2)= ~16*-1.26= -20.16 close but no.

At large positive x, x³ dominates, positive, while the right side grows proportional to cbrt(x), which grows slowly, so f(x)→+∞.

At large negative x, x³ dominates.

We've identified x=-2 as one solution, potentially the only real one.

The behavior of f(x) around x=-2:

f(-2):

=> (-2)^3 -8 -16 cbrt(-1)

=> -8 -8 -16 (-1)

=> -16 +16=0

Confirmed. So x=-2 is a solution.

Check the monotonicity to see whether there are multiple solutions.

Derivative:

f'(x) = 3x^2 - (16) * (1/3)*(x+1)^{-2/3} = 3x^2 - (16/3)*(x+1)^{-2/3}

At x= -2, x+1= -1, but the derivative at x=-2 involves (x+1)^{-2/3} = (-1)^{-2/3} = 1, since raising to an even power makes it positive.

Thus:

f'(-2): 3*4 - (16/3)*1= 12 - 16/3 ≈ 12 - 5.33= 6.66>0

The derivative is positive at x=-2; f is increasing there.

Since f(x)→ -∞ as x→ -∞, and f(-2)=0 with f'(-2)>0, the function is increasing at that point, and that is likely the only real root.

Similarly, for x larger than -2, the function continues to increase.

Because the function crosses zero at x=-2 and then remains positive afterwards, x=-2 is the only real solution.

Therefore, the solution set is simply the singleton {-2}.

Based on this analysis, the set omnimath468_answer would be { -2 }.
