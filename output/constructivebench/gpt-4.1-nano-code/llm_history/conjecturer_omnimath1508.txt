The error occurs because the variable `n` is used in the definition of `omnimath1508_answer` outside of a context where `n` is defined. To fix this, I will convert the answer into a closed-form expression that does not depend on the variable `n`, but rather sums over all `n`. 

Analyzing the partial sums numerically, the sum appears to be a geometric series involving the Fibonacci numbers and powers of 4. The sum:
\[ \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\mathrm{fib}(n+1)}{4^{n+2}} \]
which simplifies using properties of Fibonacci numbers and geometric series.

Given the partial sums and the pattern `(3/4) * (1 - (1/4)^(n+1))`, summing from 0 to infinity, the infinite sum is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \]

because as \( n \to \infty \), \( (1/4)^{n+1} \to 0 \), making the sum:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 1 = \frac{3}{4} \].

Therefore, the answer is the sum of the infinite series:
\[ \boxed{\frac{3}{4}} \]

Here is the fixed Lean code defining a closed-form answer:
