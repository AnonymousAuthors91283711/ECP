. Enumerated answers: (7, 11)
(11, 7). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
The pattern suggests solutions are symmetric pairs with x ≠ y, satisfying the given quadratic form. The proposed set includes both (7,11) and (11,7). The symmetry indicates the solutions are precisely these two pairs with positive integers.

<<<{(x, y) | (x = 7 ∧ y = 11) ∨ (x = 11 ∧ y = 7)}>>>
