. Enumerated answers: (0, 0, 0). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ × ℝ × ℝ)
The equalities are symmetric and suggest solutions where all variables are equal or zero. Testing (0,0,0) satisfies all, and symmetry implies no other solutions exist. Therefore, the solution set only contains the point (0,0,0).
