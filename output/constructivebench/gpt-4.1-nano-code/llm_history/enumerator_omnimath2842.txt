The problem appears to involve several variables and a predicate P defined over elements of the set S = {1, 2, ..., 10}. It seeks to find the greatest value y such that there exist distinct a, b, c, d in S with P a b c d = y, where P(a, b, c, d) = a * c + b * d - a * d - b * c. 

Given that P's form resembles a determinant or a difference of products, and four elements are involved, we can systematically enumerate all quadruples with distinct elements from 1 to 10, compute P for each, and track the maximum y found.

To adhere to the requirements:
- We'll print each maximum candidate as we find it.
- Since the maximum is sought, we'll sort by P value and output the maximum at the end.
- The code will be efficient enough given the small range (max 10 elements).

Here's the approach:
- Generate all 4-element combinations of S with distinct elements.
- For each quadruple, compute P.
- Keep track of maximum P and corresponding quadruples.
- Print each candidate as it is checked, especially if it exceeds the previous maximum.

```python
import itertools

# Define the set S = {1, 2, ..., 10}
S = range(1, 11)

# Define the polynomial P
def P(a, b, c, d):
    return a * c + b * d - a * d - b * c

max_value = None
max_quadruples = []

# Generate all 4-element permutations to ensure distinctness
for a, b, c, d in itertools.permutations(S, 4):
    val = P(a, b, c, d)
    # Print each candidate value along with the quadruple
    print(f"Quadruple: ({a}, {b}, {c}, {d}) -> P = {val}")
    if max_value is None or val > max_value:
        max_value = val
        max_quadruples = [(a, b, c, d)]
        print(f"New maximum found: {val} with quadruple ({a}, {b}, {c}, {d})")
    elif val == max_value:
        max_quadruples.append((a, b, c, d))
        print(f"Found another quadruple with current maximum {val}: ({a}, {b}, {c}, {d})")

# Output the maximum value found
print(f"Maximum value of P is {max_value}")
```
