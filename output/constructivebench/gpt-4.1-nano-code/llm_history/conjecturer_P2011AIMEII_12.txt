theorem P2011AIMEII_12 :
  let total := (9 - 1).factorial / 2  -- circular permutations
  let valid := 3^3 * 6 * 4 * 2  -- counting valid arrangements
  let prob := (valid, total)
  IsCoprime prob.1 prob.2 ∧ prob = P2011AIMEII_12_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Numerator (valid arrangements): 1296
Denominator (total arrangements): 20160
Are coprime: False
Answer: (1296, 20160). Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
The total arrangements are 9! / 2 to account for symmetry, and valid arrangements as 3^3 * 6 * 4 * 2, which simplifies to 1296. Since they are not coprime, the canonical form of the fraction reduces: gcd(1296, 20160) = 576, and dividing numerator and denominator by 576 yields (2, 35). According to the pattern of the enumerated answer, the simplified form is: 

<<<(2, 35)>>>.
