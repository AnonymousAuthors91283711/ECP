The problem counts sequences of nested subsets of {0,...,9}, each sequence length ≤ 10, with nestedness constraint. The number of such sequences resembles the count of chains in the Boolean lattice. For length ℓ, number of chains is C(10, ℓ). Summing over ℓ=0 to 10 yields 2^{10}. Therefore, the total number of such sequences is 2^{10}.
