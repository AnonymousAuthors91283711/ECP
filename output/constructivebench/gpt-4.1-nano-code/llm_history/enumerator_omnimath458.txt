Let's analyze the theorem structure to find the parameters A, B, C that satisfy all conditions:

- A, B, C are single-digit natural numbers (0–9).
- The answer "omnimath458_answer" equals 100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C.
- It also equals 491 * (100*A + 10*B + C) * 2.
- The primes involved: 491 and 100*A + 10*B + C must be prime.

From the equations:
```
100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C = 2 * 491 * (100A + 10B + C)
```
Define `N = 100A + 10B + C` (a three-digit number from 0 to 999).

Expressing the left side:
```
LHS = 100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C
```
Express the right side:
```
RHS = 2 * 491 * N
```

Note that 100100*A = 1001*100*A, 10010*B=1001*10*B, 1001*C=1001*C.

Factor 1001:
```
LHS = 1001 * (100*A + 10*B + C) = 1001 * N
```

Thus:
```
LHS = 1001 * N
```

Since the equality states:
```
1001 * N = 2 * 491 * N
```

Divide both sides by N (assuming N ≠ 0):
```
1001 = 2 * 491
```

Calculate 2 * 491:
```
2 * 491 = 982
```

Compare:
```
1001 ≠ 982
```

Contradiction unless N = 0.

Check N=0:

- N = 0 is prime? No, 0 is not prime.
- But the problem states "Nat.Prime (100*A+B+C)", so N ≠ 0.

But the derivation indicates an inconsistency: LHS equals 1001*N, RHS equals 982*N, which can only be equal if N=0 (which is invalid for a prime). This suggests a misinterpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the prime dividing is only `100*A + 10*B + C`, not necessarily N=0.

Given the primes:

- 491 is prime.
- Mean of 100*A + 10*B + C must be prime, and A,B,C < 10.

Now, since:
```
LHS = 100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C
```
and:
```
LHS = 2 * 491 * N
```

Divide both sides by 1001:
```
(100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C) / 1001 = 2 * 491 * N / 1001
```

But note:
```
1001 divides 100100*A, 10010*B, and 1001*C exactly:
- 100100 / 1001 = 100
- 10010 / 1001 ≈ 10
- C remains (since 1001*C / 1001 = C)
```

Compute:
```
LHS / 1001 = 100*A + 10*B + C = N
```

Therefore:
```
LHS = 1001 * N
```

So from earlier:
```
LHS = 1001 * N
and
LHS = 2 * 491 * N
```

Set equal:
```
1001 * N = 982 * N
```

which implies:
```
(1001 - 982) * N = 0
=> 19 * N = 0
=> N=0
```

But N=0 can't be prime, contradicting the prime condition.

Possible conclusion: the only way is N=0, invalid, or some misinterpretation.

Given the problem setup, perhaps we are supposed to verify the expression values rather than an explicit solution, or the code should search for valid A, B, C within [0,9].

Let's implement code to check all small options arrangements for A, B, C such that:

- A < 10, B < 10, C < 10
- 100*A + 10*B + C is prime
- The value of "answer" matches the form
- The key equation:

Check for each triplet:

Since the algebra suggests possible contradiction, perhaps the problem is only testing if such triplet exists with these properties.

Here's a program that searches all A,B,C in [0..9], testing the prime and equality properties:

```python
import sympy
from sympy import isprime

for A in range(10):
    for B in range(10):
        for C in range(10):
            N = 100*A + 10*B + C
            if isprime(N):
                answer = 100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C
                # Check if answer equals 2 * 491 * N
                if answer == 2 * 491 * N:
                    print(f'A={A}, B={B}, C={C}, N={N}, answer={answer}')
```

This code exhaustively searches for all small triplets and checks the key conditions.

**Note:** To run this code, you must have `sympy` installed. It efficiently tests for prime numbers without hardcoding.

Full code for output:

```python
import sympy
from sympy import isprime

# Search for all valid triplets A, B, C with 0 <= A,B,C <= 9
# such that:
# 1) N = 100*A + 10*B + C is prime
# 2) answer = 100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C
# 3) answer = 2 * 491 * N

for A in range(10):
    for B in range(10):
        for C in range(10):
            N = 100*A + 10*B + C
            if isprime(N):
                answer = 100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C
                if answer == 2 * 491 * N:
                    print(f'A={A}, B={B}, C={C}, N={N}, answer={answer}')
```
[refine_program]
The problem asks to find digits A, B, C (each less than 10), such that:

- N = 100*A + 10*B + C is prime.
- The answer = 100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C.
- The answer equals 2 * 491 * N.
- Additionally, A, B, C < 10, and the solution should be output as soon as found.

The provided Python code correctly enumerates all triplets (A, B, C) but doesn't produce any matches, resulting in no output and an empty result.

Because the problem's manual verification indicates no solution exists for the small digit ranges, and the program produces no output, the program is logically correct in brute-force enumeration, but the actual problem statement suggests the intended solution might be invisible to this range.

**Judgement:**
The code only enumerates, finds no solution, and outputs nothing, whereas the problem requires immediate output upon finding a solution. Even if no solution exists, for consistency, the program should at least recognize and state that.

Given the current code's behavior matches the enumeration task but produces no output, I conclude that the code does not meet the problem's expectations of streaming output upon finding solutions. The problem expects code to either print matching answers or conclude none exist.

**Acceptance:**
<<<False>>>

**Corrected Program:**

```python
import sympy
from sympy import isprime

found = False
for A in range(10):
    for B in range(10):
        for C in range(10):
            N = 100*A + 10*B + C
            if isprime(N):
                answer = 100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C
                if answer == 2 * 491 * N:
                    print(f'A={A}, B={B}, C={C}, N={N}, answer={answer}')
                    found = True
# Optional: indicate if no solution was found
if not found:
    print("No solution found.")
```
