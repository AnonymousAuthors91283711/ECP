The problem defines a recurrence relation for a sequence \(a(n)\):

\[ a(n+3) = a(n+2) - 2a(n+1) + a(n) \]

with initial conditions:

\[ a(1) = 1, \quad a(3) = 1 \]

and the condition:

\[ a(98) = a(99). \]

We need to compute the sum \(\sum_{i=0}^{100} a(i)\). The key constraints suggest the sequence is determined by the recurrence and initial conditions, with an eventual equality at \(a(98)\) and \(a(99)\).

---

The goal is to find the value of this sum explicitly or as an exact expression. Since the recurrence is linear with constant coefficients, the sequence can be expressed as a linear combination of solutions to the characteristic equation.

However, to assist in conjecturing, I will generate possible solutions by assuming small parameter values, iterating through possible initial values constrained by the given conditions, and checking for the \(a(98) = a(99)\) condition, then summing.

To do this efficiently, and because only the sum from 0 to 100 is needed, I will:

- Fix initial values \(a(0), a(1), a(2)\) compatible with \(a(1) = 1\), \(a(3) = 1\).
- For each such initial triplet, generate \(a(n)\) for \(n=0..100\).
- Check if \(a(98) = a(99)\).
- If so, compute and print the sum.

Note: The initial data gives \(a(1) = 1\). We don't have \(a(0)\) or \(a(2)\), so we'll vary these in small ranges, e.g., between -10 and 10, to find consistent solutions.

```python
# Enumerate small initial conditions to find sequences satisfying the recurrence and the equality constraint.
# For each candidate, generate sequence up to n=100 and sum it if the condition matches.
# Print each qualifying sum.

def recurrence(a0, a1, a2):
    a = [a0, a1, a2]
    for n in range(3, 102):
        # a(n+3) = a(n+2) - 2*a(n+1) + a(n)
        a.append(a[n-1] - 2*a[n-2] + a[n-3])
    return a

for a0 in range(-10, 11):
    for a2 in range(-10, 11):
        a_list = recurrence(a0, 1, a2)
        # Check the condition a(98) = a(99)
        if abs(a_list[98] - a_list[99]) < 1e-9:
            total_sum = sum(a_list[:101])  # sum from a(0) to a(100)
            print(f"Initial conditions: a0={a0}, a1=1, a2={a2}")
            print(f"Sum of first 101 terms: {total_sum}")

Let's analyze the problem carefully.

**Understanding the problem:**

- The sequence \(a(n)\) satisfies the recurrence: 

  \[
  a(n + 3) = a(n + 2) - 2a(n + 1) + a(n)
  \]
  
- Given initial conditions:
  
  \[
  a(1) = 1, \quad a(3) = 1
  \]
  
- Additional condition:

  \[
  a(98) = a(99)
  \]
  
- The goal is to compute the sum:

  \[
  \sum_{i=0}^{100} a(i)
  \]
  
**Key observations:**

- The code snippet:

  ```python
  a_list = recurrence(a0, 1, a2)
  ```
  
  indicates that \(a(0)=a0\), \(a(1)=1\), \(a(2)=a2\). 

- The original problem specifies \(a(1) = 1\) and \(a(3) = 1\). It does **not** specify \(a(0)\), but the code assumes \(a(0)\) is adaptable by iterating over values.

- The code searches over \(a0\) and \(a2\) within small ranges, but it doesn't enforce the given initial condition \(a(3)=1\) explicitly; possibly due to inconsistencies in indexing.

- The recurrence uses \(a(n+3) = a(n+2) - 2a(n+1) + a(n)\), which is a linear recurrence. The initial conditions for the recurrence should be \(a(0), a(1), a(2)\). 

- The key is matching the boundary conditions:

  - \(a(1) = 1\)

  - \(a(3) = 1\)

- Since the code initializes \(a(1)=1\), and searches over \(a(0)\) and \(a(2)\), but the code does **not** check whether \(a(3)=1\), which is a problem because the recurrence computes \(a(3)\) directly, but the initial conditions affect this.

**Critical:**

The code does **not** enforce the condition \(a(3)=1\). The recurrence is designed to generate \(a(3)\) from previous terms

The provided code snippet is incomplete and contains placeholders ("sorry") as well as undefined functions ("recurrence"). The problem asks to find the sum of the sequence \(a_i\) defined by the recurrence relation \(a_{n+3} = a_{n+2} - 2a_{n+1} + a_n\), with initial conditions \(a_1=1\), \(a_3=1\), and the condition \(a_{98}=a_{99}\). The sum is \(\sum_{i=0}^{100} a_i\).

The Python snippet attempts to generate the sequence via some recurrence function, but the code is not operational, and the output indicates an error with an empty result.

Given the problem, I can derive the sequence's explicit formula:

1. The recurrence relation is linear and homogeneous: \(a_{n+3} = a_{n+2} - 2a_{n+1} + a_n\).

2. The characteristic equation: \(r^3 = r^2 - 2r + 1 \Rightarrow r^3 - r^2 + 2r - 1= 0\).

3. Factorizing: Let's attempt to find roots.

Try \(r=1\):

\(1 -1 +2 -1=1\neq 0\). No.

Try \(r=-1\):

\(-1 -1 -2 -1= -5\neq 0\). No.

Try \(r= \frac{1}{2}\):

\((1/8) - (1/4) + (1) - 1 = (0.125 - 0.25 + 1 -1)= -0.125 \neq 0\).

Let's find roots numerically or note the characteristic polynomial:

\(r^3 - r^2 + 2r -1= 0\).

Testing \(r=1.5\):

\((3.375) - (2.25) + 3 - 1= 3.375 -2.25 + 3 -1= 3.125\neq 0\).

Testing \(r=0.5\):

\(\approx 0.125 -0.25 + 1 -1= -0.125\).

Between 0.5 and 1.0, the polynomial crosses zero.

Likewise, since roots are not
