The sequence defines a recursive relation: a(1) = 1, a(n) = (a(n-1))! + 1 for n > 1. The terms grow rapidly—factorials increase faster than exponential functions—so we find the minimal n where a(n) > 10^10. Checking terms:

- a(2) = 2! + 1 = 3
- a(3) = 3! + 1 = 7
- a(4) = 7! + 1 = 5041
- a(5) = 5041! + 1 (vastly exceeds 10^10)

Therefore, minimal n is 5, and a(n) at that index is 5041! + 1.

. Current Proposed Answer: The sequence defines a recursive relation: a(1) = 1, a(n) = (a(n-1))! + 1 for n > 1. The terms grow rapidly—factorials increase faster than exponential functions—so we find the minimal n where a(n) > 10^10. Checking terms:

- a(4) = 7! + 1 = 5041
- a(5) = 5041! + 1 (vastly exceeds 10^10)

Therefore, minimal n is 5, and a(n) at that index is 5041! + 1.

To fix the error in the Lean code, we must provide a concrete, closed-form answer, specifically the minimal number n satisfying the inequality. From the computation, the sequence's values grow extremely fast, and the first term exceeding 10^10 is at n=5, with a(5) = 5041! + 1, which is indeed much larger than 10^10.

Given the recursive nature of a(n), and the sequence's rapid growth, it's natural to conclude that the minimal n is 5. As the answer must be a fixed natural number, the simplest and most precise form is this constant.

The previous code contained a problematic comment and unclear syntax, so the correct Lean definition should simply be an answer of constant 5.
