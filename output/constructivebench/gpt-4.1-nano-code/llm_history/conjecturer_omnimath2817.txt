abbrev omnimath2817_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2817 (x : ℝ) : (10 : ℝ)^x * (10 : ℝ)^5 = (100 : ℝ)^4 ↔ x = omnimath2817_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x = 3 satisfies equation: 100000000 = 100000000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The equation simplifies to 10^{x+5} = 10^8, so x + 5 = 8, thus x = 3.  
Answer: <<<3>>>
