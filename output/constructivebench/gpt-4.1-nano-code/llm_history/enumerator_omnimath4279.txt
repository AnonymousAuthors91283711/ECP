The problem involves characterizing functions \(f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying a complex functional equation with positivity and monotonicity conditions. Since the formal theorem and the "answer" are placeholders, I interpret that the core challenge is to find and verify candidate functions \(f\) that satisfy the given relations, especially in the context of positive real inputs.

Below is a Python program that attempts to explore candidate functions of a simple form, e.g., power functions \(f(x) = x^k\), for small rational \(k\). It tests whether they satisfy the given functional equation for some small sample values, assuming \(x,y,z\) are positive real numbers.

The code:
- Fixes a few small values of the parameter \(k\),
- Checks the equation for several positive triples,
- Streams the candidate solutions when the approximation is sufficiently close, focusing on exact algebraic forms like power functions.

This should help in conjecturing the true form of \(f\).

```python
import math

# Candidate functions: power functions f(x) = x^k for small rational k
candidate_ks = [0.5, 1, 2, 3]

# Sample positive values for x, y, z
test_values = [
    (1, 1, 1),
    (2, 3, 4),
    (0.5, 2, 8),
    (1.5, 2.5, 3.5),
    (0.1, 10, 100),
]

for k in candidate_ks:
    print(f"Testing candidate power function with k={k}")
    f = lambda x, k=k: x ** k
    satisfies = True
    for x, y, z in test_values:
        # Calculate LHS
        lhs = f(x*y*z) + f(x) + f(y) + f(z)
        # Calculate RHS
        rhs = f(math.sqrt(x*y)) * f(math.sqrt(y*z)) * f(math.sqrt(z*x))
        # Check if the two are close enough
        if not math.isclose(lhs, rhs, rel_tol=1e-6, abs_tol=1e-9):
            print(f" - Failed on input ({x}, {y}, {z}): lhs={lhs}, rhs={rhs}")
            satisfies = False
            break
    if satisfies:
        print(f"Candidate f(x) = x^{k} satisfies the functional equation on tested samples.")
        print(f"Possible f(x) = x^{k} for some k > 0, consistent with the problem's conditions.\n")
```
