This problem involves finding the maximum value of `seq 5` (which equals `n`) for a sequence defined by `seq k = a + k * d`, subject to several constraints:

- `seq 5 = 2 * seq 0`  (the 6th term equals twice the first term)
- The sum of the first 6 terms is 990
- The sequence is linear with parameters `a` and `d`

Given the sequence:
```
seq k = a + k * d
```

Constraints:
1. `seq 5 = 2 * seq 0` → `a + 5d = 2a` → `5d = a` → `a = 5d`
2. Sum of first 6 terms:
```
sum = sum_{k=0}^5 (a + k * d) = 6a + d * (0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) = 6a + 15d
```
Substitute `a = 5d`:
```
sum = 6 * 5d + 15d = 30d + 15d = 45d
```
Given sum is 990:
```
45d = 990 → d = 22
```
Calculate `a`:
```
a = 5d = 5 * 22 = 110
```
Compute `seq 5`:
```
seq 5 = a + 5d = 110 + 5*22 = 110 + 110 = 220
```

Since all parameters are fixed, the sequence parameters are unique, and the maximal `n = seq 5` is 220.

Now, to match the code structure:

```python
# The problem simplifies to solving linear equations under given constraints.
# The unique solution indicates the maximum n, which is 220.

print(220)
```
