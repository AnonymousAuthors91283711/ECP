The problem appears to be about finding the minimal size of a subset S within the integers from 1 to n that can approximate every integer in that range by the floors of scaled integers, with the scaling factor β. The theorem seeks the least k such that such a set exists for each n.

Since the problem involves an existential minimal k and the set S with specific properties, a typical strategy is:
- For small n, enumerate all possible subset sizes k from 1 up to n.
- For each size k, generate all subsets S ⊆ [1, n] of size k.
- Check whether there exists a β > 0 satisfying the approximation condition for that S.
- Stop at the minimal such k when the condition holds.

Because of complexity, to generate strategies efficiently:
- For small n (say, n ≤ 10), explicitly examine small subsets.
- For each subset, approximate if there exists such β to satisfy the approximation for all y.

Below is a skeleton Python program to perform a brute-force search over small n, subset sizes, and candidate sets S, attempting to find minimal k.
