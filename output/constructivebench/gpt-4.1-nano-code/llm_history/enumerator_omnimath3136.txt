The problem asks for the size of the set of natural numbers \( p \) such that \( p > 0 \) and the difference \( \sqrt{p} - 10 \) lies strictly between -1 and 1. 

Since \(\sqrt{p} - 10 \in (-1, 1)\), we can rewrite the inequalities:
\[
-1 < \sqrt{p} - 10 < 1
\]
which leads to:
\[
9 < \sqrt{p} < 11
\]

Squaring all parts (noting that everything is non-negative here):
\[
81 < p < 121
\]

Given \( p \) is a natural number, this corresponds to:
\[
p \in \{82, 83, 84, \ldots, 120\}
\]

including 82 and 120. The number of elements:
\[
120 - 82 + 1 = 39
\]

Here's a program that enumerates all such \( p \) values, confirms the count, and prints actual \( p \) values within the range.

```python
# Enumerate all p in the range where sqrt p - 10 is between -1 and 1
# This corresponds to p in (81, 121), i.e., p from 82 to 120 inclusive.

results = []
for p in range(82, 121):
    diff = (p**0.5) - 10
    if -1 < diff < 1:
        print(p)          # Stream the valid p values
        results.append(p)
print("Total count:", len(results))
```
