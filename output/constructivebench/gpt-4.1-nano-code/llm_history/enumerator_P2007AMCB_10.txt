This problem asks us to find a total number of people (or some entity) based on the given constraints involving percentages, changes, and modular conditions. The key points:

- The initial number of girls is 40% of total.
- After some change, girls are 30% of the new total.
- The total must satisfy a modular condition for 5.

Let's assume the total is a positive integer `total`. The equations can be interpreted as:

1. Initial girls: `initial_girls = (2 * total) / 5`.
2. After some change, total becomes `total - 2 + 2 = total` (since the equation simplifies).
3. The number of girls after change: `(2 * total / 5 - 2) * 10`, which should match `3 * total`.

From these, we find possible `total` values by enumerating small integers and checking the conditions.

Here's the Python code:

```python
# Enumerate possible totals up to 100 for simplicity
# Check the constraints and print all solutions
for total in range(1, 101):
    # Check if initial girls is an integer and 40% of total
    if (2 * total) % 5 != 0:
        continue
    initial_girls = (2 * total) // 5

    # Compute girls after change
    girls_after_change = (initial_girls - 2) * 10

    # Check if the girls after change represent 30% of total
    # Avoid division by zero
    if total == 0:
        continue
    if 3 * total == girls_after_change and girls_after_change % 1 == 0:
        # Output the total and the computed girls after change
        print(f'Total: {total}')
        print(f'Girls after change: {girls_after_change}')
        print(f'P2007AMCB_10_answer: {girls_after_change}')
```

This code searches for total values satisfying the modular, percentage, and equation constraints. It prints all solutions found within the range.
