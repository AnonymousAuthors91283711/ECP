This is a high-level formal math problem involving functional equations. To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will generate candidate functions fitting the given functional property \( f(x) \times f(y) = f(x - y) \). We can explore known solutions (like constant functions, exponential functions, etc.) and test their values at 2017. Due to the functional equation's form, typical solutions include constant functions, the zero function, or exponential-type functions.

Below, I will enumerate candidate functions using small parameter samples and check if they satisfy the property. I'll prioritize simpler candidate functions: constant functions and exponential functions with small bases, then output the values of \(f(2017)\).

```python
import math

# List to store candidate answers
answers = []

# Check constant functions: f(x) = c
for c in [-1, 0, 1]:
    # For constant functions, the functional equation reduces to c*c = c
    if c * c == c:
        y = c  # f(2017) = c
        answers.append(y)
        print(f"Constant function f(x) = {c}, f(2017) = {y}")

# Check exponential functions of form f(x) = a^x, with small base a
# The functional equation: a^x * a^y = a^{x - y} -> a^{x + y} = a^{x - y}
# which implies a^{x + y} = a^{x - y}, so a^{x + y} = a^{x - y}
# For this to hold for all x,y, need a^{x + y} = a^{x - y}
# implies a^{y} = a^{- y} -> a^{2y} = 1 for all y, so a^{2} = 1 => a = 1 or -1

for a in [1, -1]:
    f2017 = a ** 2017
    answers.append(f2017)
    print(f"Exponential function f(x) = {a}^x, f(2017) = {f2017}")

# Check if any other solutions are suggested:
# Zero function: f(x) = 0
# 0*0=0, works trivially, so f(2017)=0
answers.append(0)
print("Zero function f(x)=0, f(2017)=0")

# Summarize answers
unique_answers = sorted(set(answers))
for ans in unique_answers:
    print(f"Candidate answer: {ans}")
```
