Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 2^(2 * n)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 2^(n + 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting the number of triples (A, B, C) where:
   - A ⊆ B
   - (Sn \ A) ⊆ C
   for subsets of {1, 2, ..., n}

2. For each element x ∈ {1, 2, ..., n}, there are 4 possibilities:
   - x ∈ A (which implies x ∈ B)
   - x ∈ B but not in A
   - x ∈ C but not in B
   - x not in any of them

3. However, the constraints mean:
   - If x ∈ A, then x must be in B (but C is free)
   - If x ∉ A, then x must be in C (but B is free)

4. This gives us 3 choices per element:
   - x ∈ A (implies x ∈ B, C free)
   - x ∉ A and x ∈ C (B free)
   - x ∉ A and x ∉ C (must have x ∉ B)

5. The ground truth answer 2^(2n) seems correct as it accounts for all possible combinations of B and C (each having 2^n possibilities, independent of A).

6. The proposed answer 2^(n+1) is incorrect as it grows much slower than the actual number of possibilities.
