Sum of all such a: 16. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The error stems from attempting to assign an expression involving an equality (= 16) directly to a definition of type ℤ. The expression `(8 + 9) + (-1 + 0) = 16` is a Prop (statement), not a value of type ℤ. To fix this, I should define `P2015AMCA_18_answer` as the sum of all elements `a` in `S`. The sum should be the sum over the enumerated elements `-1`, `0`, `8`, and `9`. So the corrected answer should be a sum of those elements, i.e., `(-1) + 0 + 8 + 9 = 16`, written purely as an ℤ value.

Although the sum of these elements is 16, I will explicitly write the sum as an addition of the elements. To align with the pattern, I will use `-1 + 0 + 8 + 9`, which sums to 16. This matches the enumerated answer and provides a meaningful value of type ℤ. 

Final answer:

<<<-1 + 0 + 8 + 9>>>
