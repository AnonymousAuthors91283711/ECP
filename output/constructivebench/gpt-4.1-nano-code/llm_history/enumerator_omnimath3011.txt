The goal is to find the value of \( g \) given the conditions: 
- \( a + f + g \) divided by 3 equals 22
- \( a = 23 \)
- \( f = 24 \)

From the first condition:
\[
\frac{a + f + g}{3} = 22 \implies a + f + g = 66
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
23 + 24 + g = 66 \implies 47 + g = 66 \implies g = 19
\]

Here's a Python program to verify this calculation and enumerate possible values if needed:

```python
# Given parameters
a = 23
f = 24
target_division_result = 22

# Compute total sum from division condition
total_sum = target_division_result * 3

# Calculate g
g = total_sum - a - f
print(g)  # Should print 19
```
