The problem appears to involve finding or enumerating certain pairs of natural numbers, given a function `P2015AMCB_2_answer` with parameters `(ℕ × ℕ)`. Since the actual function is not provided (`sorry` placeholders are used), I will create a Python program to explore possible outputs for some small input pairs, aiming to match the example `(13, 0) = (15, 30)`. 

This involves enumerating candidate outputs based on identified patterns or plausible transformations, streaming results for potential answers, and testing small modifications. Given limited information, we assume the function applies some simple or polynomial relationships and seek outputs close to the reported example.

Here's a Python script that generically explores candidate outputs for `(13, 0)` and nearby pairs to conjecture the pattern.

```python
# Enumerate small transformations of input pairs to match target output
# Based on the example: input (13, 0) -> output (15, 30)
# We suspect some pattern involving fixed shifts or incremental steps.

def candidate_outputs(x, y):
    # Explore plausible transformations:
    # For instance, possibly output = (x + delta_x, y + delta_y)
    # or some function involving both inputs.
    for dx in range(0, 5):
        for dy in range(0, 50):
            yield (x + dx, y + dy)

# Test specific case and nearby pairs
target_input = (13, 0)
search_limit_x = 20
search_limit_y = 40

# Stream outputs for candidate pairs
for xi in range(target_input[0], search_limit_x):
    for yi in range(target_input[1], search_limit_y):
        out_x = xi + 2  # Based on example x=13 -> 15
        out_y = yi + 30 # Based on example y=0 -> 30
        print(f'Input: ({xi}, {yi}) -> Output: ({out_x}, {out_y})')
        # Check if matches example
        if (xi, yi) == target_input and (out_x, out_y) == (15, 30):
            print("Match found for example input.")
```

This script systematically explores plausible pairs close to `(13, 0)` and outputs candidate results, aiming to assist in conjecturing the actual pattern of the function.
