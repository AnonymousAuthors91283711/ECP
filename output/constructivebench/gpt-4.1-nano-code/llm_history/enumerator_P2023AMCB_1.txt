This problem appears to involve rational calculations and perhaps finding specific fractional values based on given expressions. Since the problem involves expressing a target as a fraction and performing subdivided operations, I will create a Python script to compute the sequence of steps described and output the resulting value. This will help verify the correctness and explore possible rational outcomes.

```python
# Compute the total as sum of 3 and 1/3
total = 3 + 1/3

# Calculate target as total divided by 4
target = total / 4

# Calculate transfer as target minus 1/3
transfer = target - 1/3

# Compute the answer as transfer divided by 3
answer = transfer / 3

print("Total:", total)
print("Target:", target)
print("Transfer:", transfer)
print("Answer:", answer)

# To explore exact rational value, compute as fractions
from fractions import Fraction

total_frac = Fraction(3) + Fraction(1, 3)
target_frac = total_frac / 4
transfer_frac = target_frac - Fraction(1, 3)
answer_frac = transfer_frac / 3

# Output the exact rational answer
print("Exact rational answer:", answer_frac)
```
