The problem asks for the greatest integer \( k \) dividing \( m^5 - 5m^3 + 4m \) for all integers \( m \geq 5 \). This is a classic number theory question involving divisibility properties of polynomial expressions for large \( m \). To find the greatest such \( k \), we need to examine the divisibility of the polynomial at various values and identify the common divisors in the asymptotic limit.

I will:
- Evaluate \( m^5 - 5m^3 + 4m \) for several \( m \geq 5 \)
- Find consistent divisors
- Confirm the largest divisor that divides all such values

```python
# Python program to find the greatest divisor of the polynomial m^5 - 5m^3 + 4m
# for all m >= 5.

def poly(m):
    return m**5 - 5*m**3 + 4*m

# Generate values for m from 5 to 20
values = [poly(m) for m in range(5, 21)]

# Find common divisors by checking divisibility over the sequence
# Since we're looking for the greatest common divisor (GCD)
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

# Function to compute GCD of a list
gcd_all = reduce(gcd, values)

print("Values of the polynomial for m=5 to 20:", values)
print("Greatest common divisor of these values:", gcd_all)

# To find the largest divisor that divides all these values,
# check divisors of gcd_all
def divisors(n):
    divs = set()
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.add(i)
            divs.add(n // i)
    return sorted(divs, reverse=True)

divs = divisors(gcd_all)
# The largest divisor (excluding trivial divisors like 1) will be our candidate
# For the final answer, since the problem asks for the greatest integer dividing all,
# it should be gcd_all itself if it divides all terms.

print("Possible divisors (descending):", divs)
print("Largest divisor:", divs[0])
```
