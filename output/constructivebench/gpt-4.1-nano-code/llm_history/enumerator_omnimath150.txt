The problem involves summations with factorial expressions, signs, and parameters, and asks to define a function `omnimath150_answer` that, for given parameters, equals the sum over `i` from 0 to `n` of a complicated expression involving factorials, powers, and rational numbers. The theorem suggests `S` is defined as a particular summand, and the sum over `i` from 0 to `n` should be obtained.

Given the context, our goal is to produce a Python enumerator to explore potential closed-form answers or sum values for small parameters, aiding conjectures.

We will:
- Fix small parameter ranges for k, m, n.
- Define a function that computes the sum exactly.
- Output each computed answer immediately.
- Avoid unnecessary computations.
- Use rational arithmetic with the `fractions.Fraction` class for exactness.

Since `S` is explicitly given, the sum involves factorials, powers, and binomial coefficients, which can be computed efficiently.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
import math

# Define factorials with a cache for efficiency
factorial_cache = {}
def fact(x):
    if x in factorial_cache:
        return factorial_cache[x]
    res = math.factorial(x)
    factorial_cache[x] = res
    return res

# Compute binomial coefficient using factorials
def binom(n, k):
    if k < 0 or k > n:
        return 0
    return Fraction(fact(n), fact(k) * fact(n - k))

# Define the summand S_i for given parameters
def S(i, k, m, n):
    numerator = ((-1) ** i) * fact(n + i)
    denominator = (n + k + i) * fact(i) * fact(n - i) * fact(m + i)
    return Fraction(numerator, denominator)

# Enumerate over small ranges of parameters
for k in range(1, 4):        # small k
    for m in range(k, k + 3): # m ≥ k
        for n in range(m, m + 3): # n ≥ m
            total = Fraction(0, 1)
            for i in range(0, n + 1):
                total += S(i, k, m, n)
            print(f"Parameters: k={k}, m={m}, n={n}")
            print(f"Sum: {float(total)} (exact: {total})")
```
