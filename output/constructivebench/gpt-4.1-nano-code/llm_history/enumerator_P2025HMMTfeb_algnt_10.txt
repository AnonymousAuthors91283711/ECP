The problem involves complex numbers \(a, b, c\) satisfying specific quadratic relations:

\[
\begin{cases}
a^2 = b + 6 \\
b^2 = c + 6 \\
c^2 = a + 6
\end{cases}
\]

and the goal is to find the possible values of \(a + b + c\).

Since the relations form a cycle, a good starting approach is to eliminate variables or write a single polynomial for one variable, then examine the possible sums.

We will:
- Assume the relations hold.
- Generate small sample solutions by trying small complex numbers.
- Since the equations are symmetric, look for patterns numerically.
- Enumerate candidate triples \((a, b, c)\) with small real parts, then compute sums.

Here's a Python program that:
- Tests small complex numbers (real parts from -10 to 10, imaginary parts -10 to 10) in steps.
- Checks if they satisfy the relations within a small tolerance.
- Tracks unique sums \(a + b + c\).

This approach provides candidate sums to infer the possible values.

```python
import itertools
import cmath

# Range of small values to test
real_vals = range(-10, 11)
imag_vals = range(-10, 11)
epsilon = 1e-3

candidates = set()

for a_real in real_vals:
    for a_im in imag_vals:
        a = complex(a_real, a_im)
        # Derive b from a^2 = b + 6 => b = a^2 - 6
        b = a * a - 6
        # Derive c from b^2 = c + 6 => c = b^2 - 6
        c = b * b - 6
        # Verify if c satisfies c^2 â‰ˆ a + 6
        c_calc = c
        a_check = c_calc * c_calc - 6
        if abs(a_check - a) < epsilon:
            sum_abc = a + b + c
            # Store real parts rounded to large decimal for uniqueness
            sum_rounded = round(sum_abc.real, 3) + round(sum_abc.imag, 3)*1j
            candidates.add(sum_abc)

# Print all candidate sums found
for ans in candidates:
    print("Candidate sum:", ans)
```

This code outputs possible sums \(a + b + c\) consistent with the relations near small integer and fractional values, assisting in conjecturing the exact sum(s), which can then be rigorously proved or further refined.
