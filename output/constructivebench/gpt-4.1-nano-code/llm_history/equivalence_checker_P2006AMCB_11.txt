Ground Truth Answer: 7/6
Proposed Answer:  (13) / (12)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes two scenarios with Joe and JoAnn involving mixing and drinking cream/coffee mixtures.

2. For Joe:
- Initial: 12 units
- Drinks 2 units (ratio not specified, but since he adds pure cream, we can assume he drank pure coffee)
- Adds 2 units cream
- Final cream = 2 (since he replaced with pure cream)

3. For JoAnn:
- Initial: 12 units
- Adds 2 units cream (now 14 total with ratio 12 coffee:2 cream)
- Drinks 2 units of this mixture (which has cream ratio 2/14 = 1/7)
- Final cream = 2 - (2 * 1/7) = 12/7

4. The ratio is then: Joe's final cream / JoAnn's final cream = 2 / (12/7) = 14/12 = 7/6

The ground truth answer (7/6) is correct based on this calculation. The proposed answer (13/12) doesn't match this calculation.

<<<False>>>
