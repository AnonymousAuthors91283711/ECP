Given the recurrence relation and initial conditions, the pattern suggests a quadratic form. Testing with provided data points indicates that \( a(n) = n^2 - 1 \). Therefore, \( a(5) = 24 \). The closed-form solution aligns with this pattern and initial conditions, matching the enumerated answer which converges to 24.
