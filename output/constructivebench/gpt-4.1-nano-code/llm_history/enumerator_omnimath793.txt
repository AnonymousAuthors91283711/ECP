This problem seems to involve computing a variant of Euler's totient function for a specific value, namely phi_k(2002^2 - 1, 2001), which counts numbers coprime to n up to n/k. Given the structure, we should focus on evaluating n = 2002^2 - 1, then compute the count of integers coprime to n in the set {0, 1, ..., floor(n / 2001)}.

First, understand the value n = 2002^2 - 1:
- 2002^2 = 2002 * 2002 = (2000 + 2)^2 = 2000^2 + 2*2000*2 + 2^2 = 4,000,000 + 8,000 + 4 = 4,008,004
- So, n = 4,008,004 - 1 = 4,008,003

Next, note that φ_k(n, 2001) counts the numbers x in [0, n/2001] where gcd(x, n) = 1.

- n/2001 ≈ 4,008,003 / 2001 ≈ 2003 (since 2001 * 2003 ≈ 4,008,003)

Calculate n / 2001 exactly: 4,008,003 / 2001

Because 2001 * 2003 = 2001 * (2000 + 3) = 2001*2000 + 2001*3 = 4,002,000 + 6,003 = 4,008,003 exactly.

Therefore, n / 2001 = 2003 exactly.

Thus, the set to check is 0..2003.

We need to find all x in 0..2003 such that gcd(x, 4,008,003) = 1.

To assess this efficiently, factor n:

- n = 4,008,003

Note that 4,008,003 is divisible by 3? Let's test:

Sum of digits: 4+0+0+8+0+0+3=15, divisible by 3.

Yes, so 3 divides n.

find all x where gcd(x, n)=1, with x in 0..2003.

Implementation plan:

- Factor n? For small code, naive factorization for 3:

Since 3 divides n, factor out 3:

n / 3 = 1,336,001

Check if 1,336,001 is prime or factors further: it's large, but for the enumeration, perhaps we can accept just that n is divisible by 3, and check coprimality by verifying gcd(x, n).

Since x runs from 0..2003, small enough to check gcd.

Implementing code that:

- Sets n=4,008,003

- Counts how many x in 0..2003 satisfy gcd(x, n)=1

- Prints each x where gcd(x, n)=1 to stream results

Output that count to know total coprime numbers

Let's do an enumeration for x in [0..2003]:

- For each x, compute gcd(x, n)

- If gcd=1, print x

We can also attempt to find the proportion and maybe find the exact total.

Here's the code:

```python
import math

# Compute n
n = 2002**2 - 1  # equals 4,008,003
limit = n // 2001  # equals 2003

for x in range(limit + 1):
    if math.gcd(x, n) == 1:
        print(x)
```

This code enumerates all candidates and streams each coprime x found. The total number of such x will be the value of phi_k(n, 2001). We can compute or assert the total after enumeration if desired.

**Full program:**
```python
import math

# Compute n = 2002^2 - 1
n = 2002 * 2002 - 1  # 4,008,003
limit = n // 2001    # 2003, as 2001*2003=4,008,003

# Enumerate all x in 0..2003 and print those coprime to n
for x in range(limit + 1):
    if math.gcd(x, n) == 1:
        print(x)
```
