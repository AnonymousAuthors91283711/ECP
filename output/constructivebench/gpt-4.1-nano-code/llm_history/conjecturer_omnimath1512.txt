Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 37, which is at " : ℕ := 11" in "abbrev omnimath1512_answer : ℕ := fun : ℕ := 11", there is an error: unexpected token ':'; expected '.', '[', '{', '|', '⦃' or term.

B + C + D = 11. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The main issue is with the definition of `omnimath1512_answer`. The Lean error points out that `fun : ℕ := 11` is invalid syntax. When defining an abbreviation, you should assign it directly to a specific value, such as `11`, without the redundant `fun : ℕ :=` construct.

Given the enumerated solution as B=6, C=4, D=1, and their sum 11, and considering the problem statement, it appears the answer is the sum of B, C, D.

To generalize from the enumerated solution, the answer is fixed and does not depend on A, as the solution set for a specific A yields the sum B + C + D = 11. Since the problem is specific to the given A, the total sum (B + C + D) is constant. 

Hence, the correct correction in Lean would simply be setting:

```lean
abbrev omnimath1512_answer : ℕ := 11
```

This satisfies syntax and aligns with the given solution.
