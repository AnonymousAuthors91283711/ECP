Ground Truth Answer: 110
Proposed Answer: 2 * 17^2 + 10 * 17 + 10
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for:
   - The smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n > 0 (which is 17)
   - The smallest m > 0 where 17² divides m⁴ + 1 (which is the answer we're comparing)

2. The ground truth answer is 110.

3. The proposed answer is 2*17² + 10*17 + 10. Let's calculate this:
   2*17² = 2*289 = 578
   10*17 = 170
   So total = 578 + 170 + 10 = 758

4. Now check if 758⁴ + 1 is divisible by 17² (289):
   758 mod 289 = 758 - 2*289 = 758 - 578 = 180
   So we need to check if 180⁴ + 1 ≡ 0 mod 289
   Calculating this would be complex, but we know the smallest solution is 110, not 758.

5. The proposed answer (758) is much larger than the correct answer (110), and doesn't match.
