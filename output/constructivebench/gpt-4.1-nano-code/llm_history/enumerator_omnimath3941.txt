This problem involves finding pairs of positive integers \(a, b\) such that two divisibility conditions hold simultaneously:

1. \((a^2 + b) \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod } (b^2 - a))\)
2. \((b^2 + a) \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod } (a^2 - b))\)

Given the symmetry, and the positivity constraints \(a, b > 0\), we can approach this by brute forcing small values of \(a, b\) and checking the conditions. Since the conditions involve quadratic expressions, we focus on small bounds to maintain efficiency.

The plan:
- Choose small ranges for \(a, b\) (e.g., 1 to 20).
- For each pair, check divisibility.
- Collect all pairs satisfying both conditions.
- Output each pair immediately when found.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (a, b) with small bounds
max_value = 20
for a in range(1, max_value + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_value + 1):
        denom1 = b**2 - a
        denom2 = a**2 - b
        # To avoid division by zero
        if denom1 == 0 or denom2 == 0:
            continue
        if (a**2 + b) % denom1 == 0 and (b**2 + a) % denom2 == 0:
            print((a, b))
```
