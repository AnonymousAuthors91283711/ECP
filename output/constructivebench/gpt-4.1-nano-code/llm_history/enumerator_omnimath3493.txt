[write_program]
This problem asks to determine a function `omnimath3493_answer(x)` that produces the least element of a set defined by certain transformations of `x`, under the condition `x < -2`. The set includes `x`, `x + 2`, `(1/2) * x`, `x - 2`, and `2 * x`. The goal is to find the minimal value among these for each `x` satisfying `x < -2`. The theorem asserts that this minimal value is unique and that `omnimath3493_answer(x)` outputs it.

I will write a Python program that, for some sample values of `x` less than -2, enumerates the values of the set and identifies the minimum, streaming results immediately for each.

```python
# Enumerate and identify minimum value among transformations of x for x < -2
def omnimath3493_answer(x):
    candidates = [x, x + 2, 0.5 * x, x - 2, 2 * x]
    min_value = min(candidates)
    print(f"x = {x}: candidates = {candidates}, minimal = {min_value}")
    return min_value

# Sample parameters: choose some x values less than -2
for x in [-3.5, -4, -5.5, -6, -7]:
    value = omnimath3493_answer(x)
```
