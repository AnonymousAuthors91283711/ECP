This problem appears to involve dividing work into four parts, with the third quarter being less work than the second, and the total work being proportional to some integer w. The key is to find the smallest x such that the inequality holds for some w, considering the specified portions of work.

The inequality simplifies to find the minimal x where:

\[
(800 + x) \times \frac{w}{4} \geq \text{remainingWork}
\]

with remainingWork defined as:

\[
1000w - (1000 \times \frac{w}{4} + 900 \times \frac{w}{4} + 800 \times \frac{w}{4}) \\
= 1000w - (3000w/4) = 1000w - 750w = 250w
\]

Thus, the inequality becomes:

\[
(800 + x) \times \frac{w}{4} \geq 250w
\]

Divide both sides by w (positive), then multiply both sides by 4:

\[
(800 + x) \geq 4 \times 250 = 1000
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
x \geq 200
\]

The smallest integer x satisfying this is x=200.

Here is a Python code that confirms this calculation by enumerating possible x values:

```python
# Enumerate candidate x values starting from 0 upwards
# Check for the first x where the inequality holds for some w
# Since the inequality reduces to x >= 200, verify and find the minimal x

for x in range(0, 400):  # limit search to reasonable range
    # Find the minimal w satisfying the inequality
    # Inequality: (800 + x) * (w/4) >= 250w
    # Simplifies to (800 + x) >= 1000
    if (800 + x) >= 1000:
        # For this x, any w > 0 suffices
        print(x)
        break
```
