The problem involves computing the number of ways to tile a strip of length n with tiles of length 1 or 2. The sequence defined is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, where `tilingCount(n+2) = tilingCount(n+1) + tilingCount(n)`, with base cases 1 for n=0 and n=1. We need to find `tilingCount(10)` and likely compare it to the Fibonacci number equivalent.

Since the sequence starts with `tilingCount(0)=1` and `tilingCount(1)=1`, the sequence matches Fibonacci numbers shifted: `tilingCount(n)` = Fib(n+1).

Let's enumerate `tilingCount(n)` for n=0..10:

- n=0: 1
- n=1: 1
- n=2: 2
- n=3: 3
- n=4: 5
- n=5: 8
- n=6: 13
- n=7: 21
- n=8: 34
- n=9: 55
- n=10: 89

Thus, the answer for n=10 is 89.

Below is a Python program that computes and outputs this answer:

```python
# This program computes the number of tilings for length n using the recurrence
# T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2), with T(0)=1 and T(1)=1.

def tiling_count(n):
    counts = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        counts.append(counts[-1] + counts[-2])
        print(counts[-1])  # stream the answer as it is computed
    return counts[n]

# Compute and print the answer for n=10
result = tiling_count(10)
print(f"tilingCount(10) = {result}")
```

This enumerates the sequence, streaming the intermediate Fibonacci-like counts, and shows the final answer: 89.
