The problem involves a functional equation:
\[ f(f(x)) + f(f(y)) = f(x + y) \times f(x y) \]
with the condition \(f(0) \neq 0\).

To assist in conjecturing solutions, I will enumerate possible functions satisfying simple assumptions, e.g., constant functions and linear functions, considering small parameters. Since the problem may have complex solutions, this code will generate and print candidate functions with simple forms. The goal is to help identify potential solutions or patterns from the enumerated candidates.

Here is the Python code that systematically tests candidate functions of the form \(f(x) = c\) (constant) and \(f(x) = a x + b\) (linear), within small parameter ranges, and evaluates whether they satisfy the functional equation at some sample inputs.

```python
# Enumerate constant functions f(x) = c with c in small set, checking the equation at specific points
# Enumerate linear functions f(x) = a*x + b with small integer coefficients, checking at sample points
# Print candidates immediately if they satisfy the equation on test points

def test_constant(c):
    # Check the functional equation at sample points
    x_samples = [0, 1, -1, 2, -2]
    for x in x_samples:
        for y in x_samples:
            lhs = 2 * c
            rhs = (c) * (c)
            if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-9:
                return False
    # Ensure f(0) != 0
    if c == 0:
        return False
    return True

def test_linear(a, b):
    # Test the functional equation at sample points
    x_samples = [0, 1, -1, 2, -2]
    for x in x_samples:
        for y in x_samples:
            f_x = a * x + b
            f_y = a * y + b
            f_fx = a * f_x + b
            f_fy = a * f_y + b
            lhs = f_fx + f_fy
            rhs = (a*(x + y) + b) * (a*x*y + b)
            if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-9:
                return False
    # f(0) â‰  0
    if b == 0:
        return False
    return True

print("Constant functions satisfying the equation:")
for c in range(1, 5):  # small set of constants
    if test_constant(c):
        print(f"f(x) = {c}")

print("\nLinear functions with small coefficients satisfying the equation:")
for a in range(-3, 4):
    for b in range(-3, 4):
        if test_linear(a, b):
            print(f"f(x) = {a} * x + {b}")
```

This code will output candidate constant and linear functions that meet the functional equation at sampled points, providing insights toward solutions.
