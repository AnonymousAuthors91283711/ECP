This problem seems to involve solving a simple linear equation to find `d` with the condition `10 * d + 8 = 528`, then computing `2 * d`. We need to:
- Find all `d` satisfying the given equation.
- Compute `2 * d` for each such `d`.
- Since the equation is linear and straightforward, there's only one solution for `d`.
- We will then output the value `2 * d` immediately when found.

Here's a small Python script to enumerate solutions and compute the answer:

```python
# Enumerate all possible 'd' that satisfy 10*d + 8 = 528
for d in range(0, 1000):  # upper bound large enough to include the solution
    if 10 * d + 8 == 528:
        answer = 2 * d
        print(answer)  # stream the result immediately
        break  # only one solution exists, so break after finding it
```

This code will output the `2 * d` corresponding to the solution `d`.
