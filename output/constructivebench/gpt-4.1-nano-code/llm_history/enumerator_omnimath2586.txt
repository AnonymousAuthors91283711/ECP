This problem asks for the number of functions \(f: \text{Fin}\,9 \to \text{Fin}\,9\) such that applying \(f\) five times returns the original element \(x\), i.e., \(f^{[5]}(x) = x\) for all \(x\).

In finite dynamics, a function \(f\) satisfying \(f^k = \text{id}\) on the set implies every element lies in a cycle whose length divides \(k\). Since taking the fifth power yields the identity, every cycle length of \(f\) divides 5, so each cycle length is 1 or 5.

The total number of such functions equals the sum over all partitions of the 9-element set into cycles of lengths dividing 5 (i.e., 1 or 5), and for each such partition, the number of functions respecting the cycle structure. For each cycle of length \(l\), the number of possible cycles is:

- For fixed points (length 1): \(1\) (since only 1 way to assign a fixed point),
- For 5-cycles: the number of labeled cycles is \(\frac{(n)!}{(n - l)! \, l}\), but here for permutations within the cycle, since they must satisfy \(f^l = \text{id}\), the count of cycles of length 5 is \(\binom{n}{5} \times 4! \times 1\) divided appropriately.

Alternatively, because the functions \(f\) are arbitrary functions with cycles of length dividing 5, and since it's more straightforward to count the functions directly, we observe:

- For each element, \(f\) can be in a cycle of length 1 or 5.
- The functions are determined by the cycle decomposition satisfying this.

Given this, the total number of such functions is equal to the sum over all partitions of 9 into parts of size 1 or 5, and, for each partition, the number of functions with that cycle structure:

Number of arrangements:

\[ \sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor 9/5 \rfloor} \binom{9}{5k} \times \text{(number of arrangements of cycles of length 5)} \times \text{(number of fixed points arrangements)} \]

which simplifies as:

Number of functions = sum over all configurations of choosing how many fixed points and 5-cycles, then counting arrangements accordingly.

The possible decompositions:

- Zero 5-cycles: all fixed points, but total 9 fixed points (impossible because 9 isn't divisible by 1 or 5 with such sums).
- One 5-cycle + 4 fixed points
- Two 5-cycles +  (negative, total sum exceeds 9)
- etc.

Check possible combinations:

- 1 five-cycle: 5 elements, remaining 4 fixed points
- 0 five-cycles: all fixed points: 9 fixed points

Number of functions for each:

- For 1 five-cycle: number of ways to choose 5 elements out of 9: \(\binom{9}{5}\), then arrange them into the 5-cycle: (5-1)! = 4!, fixed points arranged separately.

- For fixed points: 4, fixed points have only identity arrangement.

Further, for each such cycle, the number of functions conforming to the cycle structure is given by the number of permutations respecting the cycle lengths:

- For 1 five-cycle: number of functions with one 5-cycle: number of ways to pick 5 elements (\(\binom{9}{5}\)), then arrangements: (5 - 1)! for the cycle, and for the fixed points: identity per element.

- Since the cycle is determined by its arrangement, the count:

Number of such functions = \(\binom{9}{5} \times 4! = 126 \times 24 = 3024\).

Similarly, for all fixed points:

- All fixed: only 1 function (identity), so count = 1.

Total equals: sum of counts.

Considering more options:

- 1 five-cycle + 4 fixed points: 3024 functions.
- 0 five-cycles: 1 function (identity).

No other combination since 9 cannot be partitioned into cycles of length 5 and 1.

Thus total is 3025.

**Implementation:**

We will enumerate all possible cycle structures under these constraints and count the functions accordingly, considering the number of options for choosing elements in cycles of length dividing 5.

```python
from math import comb, factorial

# Count of functions where f^5 = id on Fin 9: cycles of length 1 or 5 partition the set
# Possible decompositions:
# 1) 9 fixed points (all fixed)
# 2) 1 cycle of length 5 + 4 fixed points

def count_functions():
    total = 0
    
    # Case 1: All fixed points
    # Only one such function: the identity
    print("All fixed points (identity): 1 function")
    total += 1
    
    # Case 2: One 5-cycle + 4 fixed points
    ways_choose_5 = comb(9, 5)
    arrangements_5_cycle = factorial(5 - 1)  # (l - 1)! for cycle arrangements
    count = ways_choose_5 * arrangements_5_cycle
    print(f"One 5-cycle + 4 fixed points: {count} functions")
    total += count
    
    print(f"Total functions satisfying f^{5} = id: {total}")
    return total
