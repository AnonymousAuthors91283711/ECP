Ground Truth Answer: 12
Proposed Answer: 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating a sum of phi_factorial(n) for certain numbers n (from 2 to 50 that are coprime with 50), then taking modulo 50 of that sum.

2. The phi_factorial function appears to be calculating the product of numbers up to n that are coprime with n (similar to Euler's totient function but with product instead of count).

3. The ground truth answer is 12, while the proposed answer is 2.

4. The difference between 12 and 2 is significant (10 units), and modulo 50 operations don't typically produce such large discrepancies unless there's a calculation error.

5. Without seeing the detailed calculations, but considering the nature of the problem and the significant difference between the answers, it's unlikely they're equivalent.
