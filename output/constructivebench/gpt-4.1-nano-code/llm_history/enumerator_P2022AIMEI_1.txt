This problem involves quadratic polynomials \( P \) and \( Q \) of degree 2 with specified leading (quadratic coefficient) and evaluation constraints at points 16 and 20, as well as at 0. The goal is to find the sum of their values at 0, which will produce a specific sum according to the given conditions.

Key observations:
- \( P \) and \( Q \) are quadratic: \( P(x) = p_2 x^2 + p_1 x + p_0 \), with coefficients \( p_2 = 2 \) and \( p_1, p_0 \) unknown.
- \( Q(x) = q_2 x^2 + q_1 x + q_0 \), with \( q_2 = -2 \).
- The evaluations at \( x = 16 \) and \( x = 20 \) give two equations per polynomial.

We derive these equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
P(16) = 54 \Rightarrow 2 \times 16^2 + p_1 \times 16 + p_0 = 54 \\
P(20) = 53 \Rightarrow 2 \times 20^2 + p_1 \times 20 + p_0 = 53 \\
Q(16) = 54 \Rightarrow -2 \times 16^2 + q_1 \times 16 + q_0 = 54 \\
Q(20) = 53 \Rightarrow -2 \times 20^2 + q_1 \times 20 + q_0 = 53
\end{cases}
\]

From these, compute \( p_1, p_0 \) and \( q_1, q_0 \), then evaluate \( P(0) = p_0 \) and \( Q(0) = q_0 \). Sum as required; we verify if the sum is constant or varies.

Below is a Python program that enumerates the possible coefficients, assists in solving, and computes the sum at zero.

```python
# Enumerate possible polynomial coefficients based on given constraints
# Since the problem specifies exact coefficients for degree and some evaluations,
# and there is only a linear system for p1,p0 and q1,q0, we directly solve these systems.

def compute_coeffs(A, B, C, D):
    # Solve for p1, p0 in the system:
    # A*p1 + p0 = C - 2*A^2
    # B*p1 + p0 = D - 2*B^2
    denom = A - B
    if denom == 0:
        return None
    p1 = ( (C - 2*A**2) - (D - 2*B**2) ) / denom
    p0 = C - 2*A**2 - p1*A
    return p1, p0

# Values for x = 16 and 20
x1, x2 = 16, 20

# For P
C1, C2 = 54, 53
p1, p0 = compute_coeffs(x1, x2, C1, C2)
# For Q
D1, D2 = 54, 53
q1, q0 = compute_coeffs(x1, x2, D1, D2)

# Compute values at 0
P_0 = p0
Q_0 = q0
total = P_0 + Q_0
print(f"P coefficients: p1={p1}, p0={p0}")
print(f"Q coefficients: q1={q1}, q0={q0}")
print(f"Sum at 0: {total}")
```
