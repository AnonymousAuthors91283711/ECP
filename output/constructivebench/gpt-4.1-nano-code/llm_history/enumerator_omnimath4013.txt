The problem appears to be about finding triples \((x, y, p)\) of natural numbers such that \(p\) is prime and \(p^x - y^p = 1\). This resembles Catalan's conjecture ( now MihÄƒilescu's theorem ), which states that the only solution in natural numbers to \(a^x - b^y = 1\) for \(a, b > 0\) and \(x, y > 1\) is \(3^2 - 2^3 = 1\). Here, the problem is specialized to \(p\) prime and the form \(p^x - y^p = 1\).

We will test small primes \(p\) and small exponents to find all solutions. Since \(p\) is prime, small primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, etc. For each prime \(p\), we try small \(x, y\). The code will generate candidate triples, filter those satisfying the equation, and print each solution as soon as it is found.

To enhance efficiency, limit the search to small bounds for \(x\) and \(y\). We will pick bounds (max 20) for example.

```python
# Enumerate solutions to p^x - y^p = 1 with p prime and small x, y
import math

# Generate small primes
def primes_up_to(n):
    sieve = [True]*(n+1)
    sieve[0:2] = [False, False]
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if sieve[i]:
            for j in range(i*i, n+1, i):
                sieve[j] = False
    return [i for i in range(2, n+1) if sieve[i]]

primes = primes_up_to(20)  # small primes

max_x = 20
max_y = 20

for p in primes:
    for x in range(2, max_x+1):  # start from 2 to avoid trivial x=1
        p_x = p**x
        for y in range(1, max_y+1):
            val = p_x - y**p
            if val == 1:
                print((x, y, p))
```
