. Enumerated answers: m=2, n=3, m^2 + n^2=13. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the enumeration and the pattern, the computed value for m^2 + n^2 when m=2 and n=3 is 13. Since m and n are positive and the expression involves nested square roots leading to these specific values, the constant sum is 13.

<<<13>>>
