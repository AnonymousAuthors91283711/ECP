. Enumerated answers: n=6, x=6.0, m=8, y=8.875, sum=14.875. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given that ⌊x⌋*x=36 and x>0, then x=36/⌊x⌋. Similarly, y=71/⌊y⌋. With n=6, x=6.0, and m=8, y=8.875, sum=14.875. Pattern suggests x=36/6=6 and y=71/8=8.875. Thus, the sum is 6 + 8.875 = 14.875. Final answer: <<<14.875>>>
