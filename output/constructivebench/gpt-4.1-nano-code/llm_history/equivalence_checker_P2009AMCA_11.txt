  F n = P2009AMCA_11_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 2 * n^2 - 2 * n + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n => 2^(n + 1) - (n + 3)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive function F with base cases:
   - F(0) = 1
   - F(1) = 1
   - F(2) = 5
   And recursive case: F(n+3) = F(n+2) + 4*(n+2)

2. The ground truth answer is a quadratic function: 2n² - 2n + 1

3. The proposed answer is an exponential function: 2^(n+1) - (n+3)

Let's test both functions with the given base cases:

For n=0:
- Ground truth: 2*0 - 0 + 1 = 1 ✔
- Proposed: 2^1 - 3 = -1 ✖ (should be 1)

For n=1:
- Ground truth: 2 - 2 + 1 = 1 ✔
- Proposed: 2^2 - 4 = 0 ✖ (should be 1)

For n=2:
- Ground truth: 8 - 4 + 1 = 5 ✔
- Proposed: 2^3 - 5 = 3 ✖ (should be 5)

The proposed answer fails all base cases, while the ground truth answer matches them perfectly. The recursive nature of the problem suggests a quadratic solution (as given in ground truth) rather than an exponential one.
