Ground Truth Answer: (62, 2)
Proposed Answer: (1, 63)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a unique pair (p₁, p₂) of positive integers satisfying:
   (p₁ + p₂ - 1)(p₁ + p₂)/2 - p₁ + 1 = 2015

2. Ground Truth (62, 2):
   (62+2-1)(62+2)/2 - 62 + 1 = 63*64/2 - 61 = 2016 - 61 = 1955 ≠ 2015

3. Proposed Answer (1, 63):
   (1+63-1)(1+63)/2 - 1 + 1 = 63*64/2 = 2016 ≠ 2015

Both answers don't satisfy the equation. However, the proposed answer (1,63) is closer to satisfying the equation (off by 1) compared to the ground truth (off by 60). 

But since neither satisfies the equation exactly, they are both incorrect. The correct answer should satisfy the equation exactly.
