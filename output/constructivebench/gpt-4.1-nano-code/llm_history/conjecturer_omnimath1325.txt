. Enumerated answers: Divisors of 2004: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 167, 334, 501, 668, 1002, 2004]
Maximum divisor (k): 2004
Least n such that 2004 in S(n): 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The set S(n) includes multiples of (n+1). To find the least n with 2004 in S(n), we need n+1 to divide 2004, with the smallest such n. The minimal n occurs when n+1 is the largest proper divisor of 2004, i.e., 2004 itself, so n = 2004 - 1, i.e., 2003.  

Final answer: <<<2003>>>
