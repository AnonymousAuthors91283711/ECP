The problem appears to involve analyzing the set \( S \subset \mathbb{R} \), defined by \( S = \{ x \mid \exists a, b, 1 \le a \le b \le 2, x = \frac{3}{a} + b \} \). We seek the sum of the supremum and infimum of \( S \), expressed in terms of a placeholder `mathodyssey81_answer`.

To assist in conjecturing this, let's analyze the extremal values of \( x = \frac{3}{a} + b \) based on constraints:

- \(a \in [1,2]\),
- \(b \in [a, 2]\).

Our goal:

- Find \(\sup S\) (maximum \(x\)), and
- Find \(\inf S\) (minimum \(x\)),
and sum these.

We consider the extremal points systematically:

1. To maximize \(x = \frac{3}{a} + b\):
   - Maximize \(b\) (since it's added) to 2,
   - Minimize \(a\) (since \(3/a\) decreases as \(a\) increases), so \(a=1\).

2. To minimize \(x\):
   - Minimize \(b\) (starting from \(b=a\)), i.e., \(b=a\),
   - Maximize \(a\) to 2 (since \(a \ge 1\), and decreasing \(a\) increases \(3/a\)).

Now, possible extremal values:

- **Maximum \(x\):**
  - \(a=1\),
  - \(b=2\),
  yielding \(x_{\max} = 3/1 + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5\).

- **Minimum \(x\):**
  - \(a=2\),
  - \(b=a=2\),

  giving \(x_{\min} = 3/2 + 2 = 1.5 + 2 = 3.5\).

The sum of these bounds is \(5 + 3.5 = 8.5\).

I'll formulate a Python program to verify these extremal valuesâ€”considering the parameter ranges discretely for accuracy:

```python
# Analyze extremal values of x = 3/a + b with constraints:
# 1 <= a <= b <= 2

# We'll evaluate at boundary points:
candidate_values = []

# Max x: a=1, b=2
a_max = 1
b_max = 2
x_max = 3 / a_max + b_max
print(f"Max candidate: a={a_max}, b={b_max}, x={x_max}")
candidate_values.append(x_max)

# Min x: a=2, b=a=2
a_min = 2
b_min = a_min
x_min = 3 / a_min + b_min
print(f"Min candidate: a={a_min}, b={b_min}, x={x_min}")
candidate_values.append(x_min)

# To verify behaviors within bounds:
# For completeness, sample intermediate points if desired
for a in [1, 1.5, 2]:
    b_lower = a
    b_upper = 2
    # Check boundary b values for extremal x
    for b in [b_lower, b_upper]:
        x = 3 / a + b
        print(f"a={a}, b={b}, x={x}")

# The sum of the extremal bounds:
answer = x_max + x_min
print(f"Sum of extremal bounds: {answer}")
```

This code explores the key extremal points to conjecture that the summed value is 8.5, matching our manual analysis.

```python
# The code above assesses boundary points and confirms the extremal sum:
# 5 + 3.5 = 8.5
```
