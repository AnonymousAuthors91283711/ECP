This problem involves a grid of 20 points (10 Ã— 2) and a relation `adj` that describes adjacency between points, where adjacency occurs between points sharing a coordinate +1 or -1 in either dimension (excluding the same point). The goal is to find the size of a maximum set `s` that is "non-adjacent" with exactly 9 points, i.e., the largest possible size of a set of points with no two adjacent (`nonnadj s`) and with `ncard = 9`.

Since the problem asks for the size of such maximum set, and the set size is fixed at 9, the key is to verify if a set of size 9 with the described property exists under the adjacency conditions and, if so, output the size.

Here's a brute-force enumeration approach:
- Generate small combinations of size 9 from the set of points.
- Check the `nonnadj` property, i.e., no two points are adjacent.
- When such a set is found, stream its size (which is fixed at 9), as per problem.

To keep within the constraints and avoid excessive computation, use small sample points (e.g., just part of the grid) and check for the existence of such sets.

```python
import itertools

# Generate all points in the grid
points = [(x, y) for x in range(10) for y in range(2)]

# Adjacency check based on the given relation
def are_adj(p, q):
    return (p[0] != q[0] and p[1] == q[1] and abs(p[0] - q[0]) == 1) or \
           (p[1] != q[1] and p[0] == q[0] and abs(p[1] - q[1]) == 1)

# Generate all subsets of size 9 (small sample for efficiency)
for subset in itertools.combinations(points, 9):
    # Check non-adjacency
    nonadj = True
    for p1, p2 in itertools.combinations(subset, 2):
        if are_adj(p1, p2):
            nonadj = False
            break
    if nonadj:
        # Found a valid set
        print(9)  # Set size
        break
```
