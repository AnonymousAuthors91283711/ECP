. Enumerated answers: n = 1 satisfies the property.
n = 3 satisfies the property.
n = 9 satisfies the property.. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The property requires for each integer k, existence of some a with a^3 + a ≡ k mod n, meaning the polynomial a^3 + a is surjective mod n. For n=1, trivial; for n=3, the polynomial covers all residues as verified; for n=9, the pattern continues as the polynomial remains surjective due to modular arithmetic properties. Larger n's fail to satisfy as they don't always produce all residues. Thus, the set of all n with the property is exactly {1, 3, 9}.
