The problem involves a monic polynomial of degree 4 over the reals, with specific evaluations. The evaluations at -1, 2, -3, and 4 match perfect squares: -1, -4, -9, -16 respectively, suggestive of a quadratic form or related structure. Let's examine the candidate polynomial that fits these conditionsâ€”specifically, the roots and form derived from these points, and then evaluate at 1.

Given:
- \(f: \text{monic degree 4}\)
- \(f(-1) = -1 = -1^2\)
- \(f(2) = -4 = -2^2\)
- \(f(-3) = -9 = -3^2\)
- \(f(4) = -16 = -4^2\)

Since the outputs are negatives of perfect squares at these inputs, check whether the polynomial's roots or factors relate to these squares.

Observation: Points are symmetric around certain values:
- At x = -1, f = -(x)^2
- At x = 2, f = - (x)^2
- At x = -3, f = - (x)^2
- At x = 4, f = - (x)^2

Attempt to express \(f(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\),
with the constraints above, and find its value at x=1.

Given these specific values, the simplest approach is to search through small degrees first (try to fit a polynomial with these values), then evaluate at x=1.

```python
# Enumerate monic degree 4 polynomials with specified values to find f(1)
# Constraints:
# f(-1) = -1, f(2) = -4, f(-3) = -9, f(4) = -16
# f(x) = x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d
# Set up the system and solve for a, b, c, d

import numpy as np

# Data points
points = [(-1, -1), (2, -4), (-3, -9), (4, -16)]
# Construct system matrix
A = []
Y = []
for x, y in points:
    A.append([x**3, x**2, x, 1])
    Y.append(y - x**4)  # Because f(x) = x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d, subtract x^4
A = np.array(A)
Y = np.array(Y)

# Solve for coefficients a, b, c, d
# Use least squares in case of inconsistency (though should be exact)
coeffs, residuals, rank, s = np.linalg.lstsq(A, Y, rcond=None)

a, b, c, d = coeffs

# Compute f(1)
f1 = 1**4 + a*1**3 + b*1**2 + c*1 + d

print(f"Computed coefficients: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}")
print(f"f(1) = {f1}")
```
