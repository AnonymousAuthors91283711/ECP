The problem appears to involve functional equations with positivity constraints and the task is to find all functions satisfying the given property. Since the full statement contains placeholders ("sorry") and formal parts, I'll interpret it as a typical functional equation problem where we are asked to identify all functions \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\), positive on positive inputs, satisfying the relation:

\[ \forall x > 0, \forall y > 0, \quad f(y \cdot (f x)^3 + x) = x^3 \cdot f y + f x \]

Given the nature of such problems, I will attempt to find candidate solutions by testing simple functions, such as constant, linear, and power functions, within a small parameter range, and check if they satisfy the functional equation.

The code will:
- Systematically test candidate functions (e.g., constant or power functions),
- Print each candidate when it satisfies the equation,
- Use small sample parameter values for quick checking,
- Use a computational approach to verify possible solutions.

Here's a Python script to assist in conjecturing possible solutions.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions: constant, linear, power functions.
import math

def check_function(f, test_points):
    # Check the functional equation on a grid of positive points
    for x in test_points['x']:
        for y in test_points['y']:
            lhs = f(y * (f(x))**3 + x)
            rhs = x**3 * f(y) + f(x)
            # Allow small numerical tolerance
            if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-6:
                return False
    return True

# Candidate functions:
# 1) Constant functions: f(x) = c > 0
# 2) Power functions: f(x) = a * x^k
# For simplicity, test c=1, a=1, k=1
test_points = {
    'x': [1, 2, 3],
    'y': [1, 2, 3],
}

# Test constant function c=1
def constant_one(x):
    return 1

if check_function(constant_one, test_points):
    print("Candidate: f(x) = 1")
# Test linear function f(x)=x
def linear_x(x):
    return x

if check_function(linear_x, test_points):
    print("Candidate: f(x) = x")
# Test power function f(x)=x^k, for k=1, 2
def power_x2(x):
    return x**2

if check_function(power_x2, test_points):
    print("Candidate: f(x) = x^2")
# Additional candidates can be included similarly
```

This script tests simple candidate functions against the functional equation for small positive values, printing out solutions that fit. It is a typical approach for conjecturing solutions to such functional equations.  
This process helps to identify trivial solutions (like constant or power functions) that may be the actual solutions, aiding in the formal proof.
