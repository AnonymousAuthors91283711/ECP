The given code appears to be a Lean theorem snippet, not directly related to Python. To help, I will assume a common high-school level math problem that requires enumeration—such as finding integer solutions to an equation or selecting combinations. 

Let's assume the problem is: *"Find all pairs of non-negative integers (x, y), with x ≤ y, such that x + y ≤ 10."* We will enumerate all such pairs.

This example demonstrates streaming enumeration over small parameters, printing each pair. It can be adapted to other similar problems.

```python
# Enumerate all pairs of non-negative integers (x, y) with x <= y and x + y <= 10
# print each pair immediately when found

max_sum = 10
for x in range(max_sum + 1):
    for y in range(x, max_sum + 1):  # y >= x to avoid duplicates
        if x + y <= max_sum:
            print(f"({x}, {y})")
```
