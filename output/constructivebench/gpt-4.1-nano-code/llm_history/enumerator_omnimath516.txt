This problem asks us to find the least common denominator \(d\) such that there exist rational numbers \(x, y\) with denominators 60 and 70 respectively, and their sum \((x + y)\) has denominator \(d\). The goal is to identify the minimal \(d\) satisfying these conditions.

The denominators can be viewed as integers with specific prime factors. The sum of \(x\) and \(y\) will have a denominator that divides the least common multiple of their denominators when expressed in lowest terms. To find the minimal such \(d\), we need to understand how denominators combine when adding rationals with specified denominators.

Since \(x\) has denominator 60, it can be written as \(\frac{a}{60}\), and similarly \(y=\frac{b}{70}\). When adding these:
\[
x + y = \frac{a}{60} + \frac{b}{70} = \frac{a \cdot 70 + b \cdot 60}{60 \cdot 70}.
\]
Simplify numerator and denominator by dividing by their greatest common divisor to get the reduced form and determine its denominator.

We are tasked to find the minimal possible denominator \(d\) after the sum reduces.

In code, I will:
- Iterate over plausible numerators for \(x\) and \(y\).
- Compute the sum and reduce to lowest terms.
- Track and output the set of possible denominators to find the minimum.

```python
from math import gcd

# Known denominators
den_x = 60
den_y = 70

# Set to hold possible denominators after sum reduction
possible_denominators = set()

# Because denominators are fixed, numerator bounds can be limited
# to reasonable ranges to find all minimal denominators.
# For simplicity, we try numerators within a bounded range.
limit = 100

for a in range(-limit, limit + 1):
    for b in range(-limit, limit + 1):
        numerator = a * den_y + b * den_x
        denom = den_x * den_y
        g = gcd(numerator, denom)
        reduced_denom = denom // g
        if reduced_denom > 0:
            print(f"x = {a}/{den_x}, y = {b}/{den_y} => sum denominator = {reduced_denom}")
            possible_denominators.add(reduced_denom)

# Output all possible denominators found
print("Possible denominators after reduction:", sorted(possible_denominators))
# Minimum denominator is the smallest in the set
min_denom = min(possible_denominators)
print("Minimum possible denominator:", min_denom)
```
