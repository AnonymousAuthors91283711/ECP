The function f is recursively defined with base f(1)=2, and for n > 1, even n reduces to f(n−1)+1, odd n reduces to f(n−2)+2. Pattern suggests, starting from 1:

- f(1) = 2
- f(2) = f(1) + 1 = 3
- f(3) = f(1) + 2 = 4
- f(4) = f(3) + 1 = 5
- f(5) = f(3) + 2 = 6
- f(6) = f(5) + 1 = 7

This indicates the pattern: f(n) = n + 1 for n ≥ 1.

Final answer: <<<n + 1>>>

. Enumerated Answers: 2018. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The main issue is that in the current answer, `n` is undefined in the scope of `abbrev P2017AMCA_7_answer : ℕ := n + 1`. Abbreviations can't depend on unbound variables; `n` needs to be specified as a concrete number or parameter.

Given the problem context and the enumerated answer (2018), the statement suggests that for the specific value 2017, `f 2017` equals 2018.

The theorem states:

- `f(1) = 2`.
- For even `n > 1`, `f(n) = f(n-1) + 1`.
- For odd `n > 1`, `f(n) = f(n-2) + 2`.

These recursive relations indicate that starting from `f(1) = 2`, the function increases by 1 or 2 based on parity, and the pattern seems to lead to `f(n) = n + 1` for `n ≥ 1`. Checking inductively, for each step:

- From `f(1)=2`, applying the rules gives expected values consistent with `f(n) = n+1`.

Thus, the illustrative final value at `n=2017` is `2018`. I will define the answer as the constant number 2018 directly, which is the particular value of `f` at 2017.

**Final answer:**

<<<2018>>>

This adheres to the constraints: it is an explicit closed-form (a constant numeral), matching the enumerated answer, and doesn't involve undefined variables.
