This is a formal theorem statement that involves properties of 2x2 matrices of natural numbers, with conditions summing to 2015 and positivity constraints. To assist in conjecturing the minimal sum `s = âˆ‘ a_i_j`, I will generate candidate matrices `a` with small positive entries that satisfy the conditions, then compute their sums. Since the minimum sum is unknown, the code will enumerate small matrices and track the smallest valid sums.

The key constraints:
- All entries `a i j` > 0
- Sum of all products along rows and columns equals 2015
- We seek the minimal sum `s` of `a i j` satisfying these

The code:
- Uses small sample ranges for `a i j` entries
- Checks the conditions for each candidate
- Stream output for each candidate

```python
# Program to enumerate small 2x2 matrices satisfying the conditions and find minimal sum
import itertools

def check_matrix(a):
    # Check all entries > 0
    if any(entry <= 0 for row in a for entry in row):
        return False
    # Compute row products
    row_products = [a[i][0] * a[i][1] for i in range(2)]
    # Compute column products
    col_products = [a[0][j] * a[1][j] for j in range(2)]
    total_sum = sum(sum(row) for row in a)
    total_products_sum = sum(row_products) + sum(col_products)
    if total_products_sum == 2015:
        return total_sum
    return False

# Range limits to keep enumerations manageable
min_value = 1
max_value = 20  # small range for quick enumeration
min_sum_found = None

for a00 in range(min_value, max_value + 1):
    for a01 in range(min_value, max_value + 1):
        for a10 in range(min_value, max_value + 1):
            for a11 in range(min_value, max_value + 1):
                a = [[a00, a01], [a10, a11]]
                result = check_matrix(a)
                if result:
                    print(f"Found candidate matrix: {a} with sum {result}")
                    if (min_sum_found is None) or (result < min_sum_found):
                        min_sum_found = result

if min_sum_found:
    print(f"Minimal valid sum found: {min_sum_found}")
else:
    print("No valid matrix found within sample range.")
```
