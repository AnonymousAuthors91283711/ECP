This problem involves counting functions \( q : \text{Fin } 4 \to \text{Fin } 9 \) with certain restrictions:
1. The images are distinct: \( q(i) \neq q(j) \) for \( i \neq j \).
2. \( q(1) < q(0) \), \( q(1) < q(2) \), and \( q(3) < q(2) \).

We need to find the number of such functions.

Analysis:
- Since \( q \) is injective, it is a permutation of 4 elements into 9 options.
- The order constraints impose inequalities involving \( q(1), q(0), q(2), q(3) \).

We will:
- Enumerate all 4-permutations of \(\{0, \dots, 8\}\).
- Check the inequalities for each.
- Count how many satisfy all conditions.

```python
# Enumerate all permutations of 4 distinct numbers chosen from 0..8
from itertools import permutations

count = 0
for perm in permutations(range(9), 4):
    q0, q1, q2, q3 = perm
    # Conditions:
    # q1 < q0, q1 < q2, q3 < q2
    if q1 < q0 and q1 < q2 and q3 < q2:
        print(perm)
        count += 1

print("Total solutions:", count)
```
This code systematically generates candidates, filters by the inequalities, and outputs each valid permutation immediately. The total count is printed at the end.
