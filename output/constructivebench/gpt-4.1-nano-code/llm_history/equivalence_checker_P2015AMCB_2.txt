abbrev P2015AMCB_2_answer : ℕ × ℕ → ℕ × ℕ := sorry
theorem P2015AMCB_2 : P2015AMCB_2_answer (13, 0) = (15, 30) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun (startHour, startMin) => 
    let startTime := startHour * 60 + startMin
    let endSecondTask := 14 * 60 + 40
    let duration := (endSecondTask - startTime) / 2
    let totalDuration := 3 * duration
    let finishTime := startTime + totalDuration
    (finishTime / 60, finishTime % 60)
Proposed Answer: λ (p : ℕ × ℕ) => (p.1 + 2, 30 + p.2)
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem involves calculating the finish time of a task that takes 3 times the duration of half the time between start and 14:40.

2. Ground Truth Answer:
   - Correctly calculates the duration as half the time between start and 14:40
   - Then calculates total duration as 3 times that
   - Finally computes finish time by adding to start time

3. Proposed Answer:
   - Simply adds 2 hours and 30 minutes to the start time
   - This would only be correct if the start time was exactly 13:00
   - Doesn't account for the actual calculation logic for other start times

The proposed answer gives the correct result for (13,0) but would be incorrect for other inputs. For example:
- For (12,0), ground truth gives (15,0) while proposed gives (14,30)
- For (14,0), ground truth gives (15,20) while proposed gives (16,30)

The proposed answer works for the specific case (13,0) but not generally.
