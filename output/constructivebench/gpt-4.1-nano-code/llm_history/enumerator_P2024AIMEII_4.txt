The problem involves positive real numbers \(x, y, z\) satisfying given symmetric sum conditions, and asks to find coprime integers \(m, n\) such that the logarithm expression simplifies to a rational number \(\frac{m}{n}\), with \(m + n\) being the answer. To assist in conjecturing, we'll explore plausible solutions by generating candidate triples satisfying the sums and sums of squares and cubes, then compute the target expression and record potential rational ratios.

Since directly solving analytically is complex, we'll choose small values for \(x, y, z\) that satisfy the constraints approximately, then compute the logs accordingly, and look for simplified rational ratios.

```python
import math

# Generate candidate positive triples (x, y, z) based on the sum and sum of squares/cubes constraints.
# We'll sample a small grid of positive values that roughly satisfy the constraints and check for the logarithmic ratio.
# Record the results where the log ratio appears close to a rational value.

# Constraints from the problem:
# x + y + z = 6
# x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 14
# x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 36

# Since exact solutions might be complicated, we try systematic sampling.

candidates = []

# Sample points for x, y, z in a reasonable range
for x in [i/10 for i in range(1, 60)]:
    for y in [j/10 for j in range(1, 60)]:
        z = 6 - x - y
        if z <= 0:
            continue
        # Check sum of squares
        if abs(x**2 + y**2 + z**2 - 14) > 0.1:
            continue
        # Check sum of cubes
        if abs(x**3 + y**3 + z**3 - 36) > 0.1:
            continue
        # Compute the log ratio: log2(x^4 y^3 z^2)
        log_value = math.log(x**4 * y**3 * z**2, 2)
        candidates.append((x, y, z, log_value))
        # For each candidate, attempt to see if log_value is close to a rational number
        # Let's approximate rational numbers for small numerator and denominator
        # We'll try denominators up to 20
        for n in range(1, 21):
            m = round(log_value * n)
            if abs(log_value - m / n) < 0.01:
                print(f"Candidate x={x:.2f}, y={y:.2f}, z={z:.2f}")
                print(f"approximate log ratio: {m}/{n} (m={m}, n={n})")
                print(f"Sum m + n = {m + n}\n")
