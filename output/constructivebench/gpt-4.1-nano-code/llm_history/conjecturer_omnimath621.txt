The pattern shows x=0 in all cases except when H=2, M=1, T=4, where x=8, or H=4, M=1, T=2, x=8, related to the sums. The maximum x seems achieved at (H,M,T) with those specific values. We observe a symmetry and the function design suggests the maximum occurs where the sum of H and M is positive and T compensates accordingly. Hence, the supremum is 8.

The core issue is that Lean's `if ... then ... else ...` construct requires a decidable condition. The current attempt uses `¬(∃ H M T, ...)`, which Lean cannot automatically decide due to the existential quantifier and the negation. Also, the existential condition is within the expression rather than elsewhere, which complicates decidability.

Since the set of solutions includes various triplets `(H, M, T)` satisfying a particular equation, and the maximum x in the set is given by `H * M * M * T` for those solutions, the greatest such x among all solutions occurs when the triplet `(H, M, T)` satisfies the equation and yields the maximum value.

From the enumerated solutions, notice that the maximum `x` value is `8`, which occurs for `(H,M,T) = (2,1,4)` and `(4,1,2)` or similarly related solutions.

Given the difficulty of directly encoding the maximum over an infinite or complex set, and considering the pattern in the enumerated solutions, an effective approach is to specify the answer as a fixed known maximum value `8`. This corresponds with the highest `x` value obtained in the solutions.

Therefore, the answer can be simply written as `8`. To do this, and to maintain compatibility with Lean's logic, define the answer as a constant, with the understanding that it corresponds to the maximum of the set.

So, the proposed final Lean answer is:

<<<8>>>

This is a closed-form, simplified, correct answer consistent with the enumerated solutions and the theorem statement.
