This problem involves finding the least natural number \( c \) for which there exist \( a, b \) such that \( a < b < c \), and a unique real solution \( x \) satisfying three equations:

\[
x^2 + a^2 = 2^x + 2^a
\]
\[
x^2 + b^2 = 2^x + 2^b
\]
\[
x^2 + c^2 = 2^x + 2^c
\]

Given the structure, for each fixed \( a, b, c \), the value of \( x \) is determined by the equations. Since the equations depend on \( x \), and the problem asks for a unique \( x \) satisfying **all three**, we can approach by fixing small values of \( a, b, c \).

1. We try small integers \( a, b, c \).
2. For each candidate triplet, solve the equations numerically (or analyze the relation).
3. Check if the \( x \) solutions coincide and are unique.
4. Find the smallest \( c \) with such triplet satisfying the conditions.

To keep the enumeration efficient, we restrict ranges:

- \( a, b, c \) from 0 to a small max (say 10).
- For each, check the equations numerically.

Below is the Python code that does this enumeration, prints candidates immediately, and logs the minimal \( c \).

# x^2 + a^2 = 2^x + 2^a

# and find roots using bisection within a reasonable range.
