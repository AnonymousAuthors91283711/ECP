theorem olympiadbench1687 (f g : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ n, iterate f (g n + 1) n + iterate g (f n) n = f (n + 1) - g (n + 1) + 1) ↔ 
  ∀ n, (f n, g n) = olympiadbench1687_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ × ℕ
Inferred pattern suggests that for each n, the pair (f n, g n) is linear with respect to n, possibly involving powers of 2 and linear coefficients. The enumerated answer indicates a simple most likely candidate is (n+1, 1). When n=0, this yields (1,1), matching a basic case of the pattern. This guess aligns with the common structure in functional identities involving iteration and index shifts. 

The general closed form, based on the pattern and enumeration, would be a constant pair extrapolated from initial conditions. The simplest consistent form for all n is (n+1, 1).
