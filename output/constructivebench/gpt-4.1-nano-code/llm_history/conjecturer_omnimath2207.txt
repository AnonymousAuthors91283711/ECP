  Fintype.card {f : Fin n → Fin n | ∀ (i j : Fin n), i < j → (f j : ℕ) < (f i : ℕ) + (j - i)} = omnimath2207_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Counting solutions for n=1
Valid permutation for n=1: (0,)
Total for n=1: 1
Counting solutions for n=2
Valid permutation for n=2: (1, 0)
Total for n=2: 1
Counting solutions for n=3
Valid permutation for n=3: (2, 1, 0)
Total for n=3: 1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The pattern suggests only the decreasing permutation (n−1, n−2, ..., 0) satisfies the inequality, leading to exactly 1 such permutation for all n ≥ 1. Thus, the solution is always 1 for any n.
