The problem is a classic work-rate problem involving divided tasks and unknown total durations. To assist in conjecturing and verifying the answer, I will enumerate possible candidate values for the total work time after the specified interval and compute the remaining time accordingly, streaming each candidate result. Since the key unknown is the total work duration until the task is complete, I will iterate over plausible total times based on reasonable constraints, then calculate the finishing time.

Note:
- The initial interval is from 8:30 to 11:10.
- Initial work done: 1/3.
- Work rate is computed based on this interval.
- Remaining work: 2/3.
- Total duration is unknown; we'll test multiple total durations (`total_time_minutes`), compute corresponding remaining times, then add to the initial endpoint.

This approach eventually helps conjecture the final finishing time.

```python
# Enumerate candidate total times (in minutes) for completing the entire work
start_time = (8, 30)
first_interval = (11, 10)

# Calculate start and first interval in minutes
start_minutes = start_time[0]*60 + start_time[1]
first_interval_minutes = first_interval[0]*60 + first_interval[1]

# Work already done: 1/3
initial_work_fraction = 1/3
# Work remaining
remaining_work_fraction = 2/3

# Time of first interval
interval_duration = first_interval_minutes - start_minutes

# Work rate during first interval
work_rate = initial_work_fraction / interval_duration

# Print the parameters used
print(f"Start time: {start_time}")
print(f"First interval end: {first_interval} ({first_interval_minutes} min)")
print(f"Work rate: {work_rate} work/min")
print(f"Remaining work: {remaining_work_fraction}")

# Enumerate over plausible total durations (up to 60 more minutes beyond first interval)
# as the entire task must finish reasonably after 11:10
for total_time in range(first_interval_minutes + 1, first_interval_minutes + 61):
    remaining_time = remaining_work_fraction / work_rate
    finish_time_minutes = first_interval_minutes + remaining_time
    # Convert finish_time_minutes to (h, m)
    h = int(finish_time_minutes // 60)
    m = int(finish_time_minutes % 60)
    print(f"Total time: {total_time} min; Finish time: ({h}, {m})")
```
