This problem appears to involve combinatorics and set analysis, specifically about minimal guesses that "cover" certain rectangles in a 3x3 grid based on adjacency conditions. The goal seems to determine the smallest number `n` such that any set of guesses (pairs in a 3x3 grid) guarantees hitting a certain pattern called `rect` (a set of 2 points satisfying adjacency criteria). The task is to find the least such `n`.

Since the specifics are complex, the approach is to enumerate small values of `n` and check whether they satisfy the covering property. We'll define a systematic way to generate guesses and test all relevant rectangles.

Key steps:
- Fix small `n`
- Generate all guesses (n-tuples of grid points)
- For each guess, check all rectangles (pairs of points) that meet adjacency criteria
- Verify that for each such rectangle, at least one guess lies in it
- Find the minimal such `n`

Let's implement an enumeration for small `n` and check empirically the minimal `n`.

```python
import itertools

# Define the grid points
points = [(x, y) for x in range(3) for y in range(3)]

# Function to check if a pair of points forms an adjacency rectangle
def is_adjacent_rect(p, q):
    # p, q are tuples like (x,y)
    return (
        (p[0] == q[0] and abs(p[1] - q[1]) == 1) or
        (p[1] == q[1] and abs(p[0] - q[0]) == 1)
    )

# Generate all 2-point rectangles meeting adjacency criteria
rectangles = []
for p1 in points:
    for p2 in points:
        if p1 < p2 and is_adjacent_rect(p1, p2):
            rectangles.append({p1, p2})

# For small n, check minimal guesses to cover all rectangles
max_n = 6  # limit for enumeration
found = False
for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    # Generate all guess sets of size n
    for guesses in itertools.combinations(points, n):
        guesses_set = set(guesses)
        # Check if all rectangles are hit
        if all(any(p in guesses_set for p in rect) for rect in rectangles):
            print(f"Minimal n: {n} with guesses: {guesses}")
            found = True
            break
    if found:
        break
```
