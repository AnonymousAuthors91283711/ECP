Let's analyze the polynomial relations and inequalities involving a, b, c under order constraints. The patterns suggest polynomial expressions close to integers with small deviations. The constraints hint that a, b, c are roughly near integers, and the polynomial expressions involve symmetric sums.

Given the symmetry and structure, the approximate value of a^5 should be close to an integer, say n. The pattern in similar algebraic relations suggests that the best integer approximation for a^5 is near 0.

Therefore, the answer is close to 0, as the difference is within 1/2. To fit the pattern, we select n = 0.
