Ground Truth Answer: 363
Proposed Answer: 27 * 14 * 3^9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes two geometric sequences aₙ and bₙ with:
   - aₙ = 27 * r^(n-1)
   - bₙ = 99 * r^(n-1)
   - With the condition a₁₅ = b₁₁

2. From a₁₅ = b₁₁, we get:
   27 * r¹⁴ = 99 * r¹⁰
   Simplifying: r⁴ = 99/27 = 11/3
   So r = (11/3)^(1/4)

3. We need to find a₉ = 27 * r⁸
   Since r⁴ = 11/3, then r⁸ = (11/3)² = 121/9
   Therefore a₉ = 27 * (121/9) = 27 * 121 / 9 = 3 * 121 = 363

The ground truth answer is 363, which matches our calculation.

The proposed answer is 27 * 14 * 3^9, which evaluates to 27 * 14 * 19683 = a much larger number (7,456,014) that doesn't match our correct calculation.
