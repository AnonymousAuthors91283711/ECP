This problem appears to involve finding a minimal rational number (least element) within a specific set defined by a certain function `mathodyssey11_answer`. The goal is to empirically evaluate the `mathodyssey11_answer` for small natural numbers, then identify the least rational satisfying the set condition, possibly associated with "13" and certain parameters.

Since the `mathodyssey11_answer` is currently unresolved (`sorry`), the best approach for enumeration and conjecture is to:
- Pick small values for `m` starting from 1 onwards
- Compute `mathodyssey11_answer m`
- Collect these rational values
- Check for the least among those satisfying the set condition (possibly linked to some pattern or bound around 13)

Given the constraints and the goal of streaming partial answers, hereâ€™s a Python script that:
- Enumerates `m` starting from 1
- Mocks `mathodyssey11_answer` with a plausible pattern or placeholder
- Prints each value immediately
- Finds the smallest `q` satisfying the set condition (assumed related to the number 13)

Note: Without the concrete definition, we use a placeholder to generate candidate answers. Replace with actual logic when available.

```python
# Enumeration script to explore values of mathodyssey11_answer and find the minimal solution
def mathodyssey11_answer(m):
    # Example pattern: rational approximation around 13
    # Replace this with actual logic once known
    return 13 - 1 / (m + 1)

answers = []

for m in range(1, 50):  # limit to first 50 to control output
    q = mathodyssey11_answer(m)
    print(f"m={m}, answer={q}")
    answers.append(q)

# Find the least q satisfying the set condition:
# Assuming the set involves q >= some threshold related to 13
threshold = 13
candidates = [q for q in answers if q >= threshold]
if candidates:
    min_q = min(candidates)
    print(f"Least q >= {threshold}: {min_q}")
```
