. Enumerated answers: x = 0.00, 2^(x*(1-x)) = 1.0000
x = 0.25, 2^(x*(1-x)) = 1.1388
x = 0.50, 2^(x*(1-x)) = 1.1892
x = 0.75, 2^(x*(1-x)) = 1.1388
x = 1.00, 2^(x*(1-x)) = 1.0000

Approximate maximum at x ≈ 0.50 with value ≈ 1.1892. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<1.1892>>>

The maximum of 2^(x*(1−x)) on [0,1] occurs at x=0.5, where x*(1−x) is maximized, giving 2^(0.25)=2^{1/4}≈1.1892, a known maximum of the quadratic parabola.
