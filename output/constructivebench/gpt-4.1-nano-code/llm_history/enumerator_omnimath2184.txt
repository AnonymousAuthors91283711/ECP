This problem appears to involve combinatorics and number theory: counting the number of functions from a finite set with bounded integer values, subject to a divisibility condition on a weighted sum.

Approach:
- For each tuple `(x_0, x_1, ..., x_2011)` with `0 ≤ x_i ≤ 2011`, check if the sum `(i+1) * x_i` is divisible by 2012.
- Since enumerating all such tuples directly (2012^2012 combinations) is infeasible, we simplify or search for patterns.
- Because the problem involves divisibility and bounded sums, a potential approach is to consider specific small examples or sum over some subset.

Given the size constraints and that we're to aid in conjecture, we can:
- Select small sample parameters.
- Use a sampling approach for quick enumeration.
- Count how many tuples satisfy the divisibility condition by brute-force for small subsets or simplified instances.

Because the exact core combinatorial enumeration is complex, we demonstrate parameter selection and enumeration for small parameters.

```python
# Enumerates all functions x: Fin 4 -> [0, 3], checking the divisibility condition.
# Prints each result immediately to assist in conjecture.

from itertools import product

# Small sample size for feasibility
n = 4
max_x = 3
divisor = 4

# Collect and count solutions
count = 0
for x_values in product(range(max_x + 1), repeat=n):
    total = sum((i + 1) * x for i, x in enumerate(x_values))
    if total % divisor == 0:
        print(f"x = {x_values}, sum = {total}")
        count += 1
print(f"Total solutions for n={n}, max_x={max_x}, divisor={divisor}: {count}")
```
