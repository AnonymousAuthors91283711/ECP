Ground Truth Answer: 501
Proposed Answer: ((201 - 1) / 4) + 1
Let me analyze the problem and the answers.

The problem is counting numbers n from 1 to 2002 where the number of 1's in the binary representation of n equals the number of 1's in n+1.

The ground truth answer is 501.

The proposed answer is ((201 - 1) / 4) + 1. Let's evaluate this:
- (201 - 1) = 200
- 200 / 4 = 50
- 50 + 1 = 51

This gives 51, which is different from 501. The proposed answer seems to be off by an order of magnitude and doesn't match the pattern we'd expect for this type of problem (numbers where binary representations have the same number of 1's when incremented).
