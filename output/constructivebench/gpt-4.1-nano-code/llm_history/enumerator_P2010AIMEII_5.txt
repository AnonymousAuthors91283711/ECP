The problem involves three positive real numbers \(x, y, z\) with a large product \(x y z = 10^{81}\), and a sum involving logs: \(\log x \cdot \log(yz) + \log y \cdot \log z = 468\). We need to find \(\sqrt{(\log x)^2 + (\log y)^2 + (\log z)^2}\).

Since the logs are involved, an effective approach is to test specific small sample values for \(\log x, \log y, \log z\). Because \(x, y, z > 0\), their logs are defined. The large product suggests logs sum to 81 (since \(\log(x y z) = \log x + \log y + \log z = 81 \times \log 10 = 81\)), and logs in base 10 implies \(\log_{10} x, y, z\). Here, since logs in mathlib's `log` default to natural logs, we should be consistent.

Assuming natural logs, then:

\[
\ln x + \ln y + \ln z = \ln(10^{81}) = 81 \ln 10
\]

But in code we can fix \(\ln 10 \approx 2.302585\). For simplicity, just treat \(\ln 10\) as a constant and set:

\[
L_x = \ln x, \quad L_y = \ln y, \quad L_z = \ln z,
\]
with
\[
L_x + L_y + L_z = 81 \times \ln 10 \approx 81 \times 2.302585 \approx 187.080085.
\]

The second condition becomes:

\[
L_x \times \ln(yz) + \ln y \times \ln z = 468,
\]
and since \(\ln(yz) = L_y + L_z\),
\[
L_x (L_y + L_z) + L_y L_z = 468.
\]

Given the sum \(L_x + L_y + L_z \approx 187.08\), for simplicity, set:

\[
L_x + L_y + L_z = S \approx 187.08.
\]

Express \(L_x = S - (L_y + L_z)\).

Substitute into the second condition:

\[
(S - (L_y + L_z))(L_y + L_z) + L_y L_z = 468.
\]

Let \(A = L_y + L_z\), \(B = L_y L_z\).

Then:
\[
(S - A)A + B = 468,
\]
so:
\[
S A - A^2 + B = 468.
\]

For fixed \(A\) and known \(S\), \(B\) can be found:

\[
B = 468 - S A + A^2.
\]

But also, since \(L_y, L_z\) are roots of quadratic:

\[
t^2 - A t + B = 0,
\]
which must have real roots for the logs of positive \(y,z\):

\[
A^2 - 4 B \ge 0.
\]

Set \(B\) from above:

\[
A^2 - 4(468 - S A + A^2) \ge 0,
\]
which simplifies to:

\[
A^2 - 4 \times 468 + 4 S A - 4 A^2 \ge 0,
\]
\[
A^2 - 4 \times 468 + 4 S A - 4 A^2 \ge 0,
\]
\[
-A^2 + 4 S A - 1872 \ge 0,
\]
\[
A^2 - 4 S A + 1872 \le 0.
\]

Given \(S \approx 187.08\), evaluate the quadratic in \(A\):

\[
A^2 - 4 \times 187.08 A + 1872 \le 0,
\]
\[
A^2 - 748.32 A + 1872 \le 0.
\]

Discriminant:

\[
D = (748.32)^2 - 4 \times 1872 \approx 560,Children \textï¼Œa0;378,976 - 7,488 = 553,890.976,
\]

which is positive, so \(A\) in an interval between roots:

\[
A = \frac{748.32 \pm \sqrt{553,890.976}}{2}.
\]

Calculate:

\[
\sqrt{553,890.976} \approx 744.25,
\]

so the roots:

\[
A_{1,2} = \frac{748.32 \pm 744.25}{2}.
\]

Range:

\[
A_1 \approx \frac{748.32 - 744.25}{2} = \frac{4.07}{2} \approx 2.035,
\]
\[
A_2 \approx \frac{748.32 + 744.25}{2} = \frac{1492.57}{2} \approx 746.285.
\]

Since \(A = L_y + L_z \ge 0\), acceptable \(A\) are in \([2.035, 746.285]\). For each \(A\) in this interval, \(B = 468 - S A + A^2\).

Choose sample \(A\) within this interval, e.g., \(A=100\), to get the logs.

Now, \(L_x = S - A \approx 187.08 - 100 = 87.08\).

Finally, compute the logs:

\[
L_x \approx 87.08,
\]
\[
L_y, L_z \text{ are roots of } t^2 - A t + B = 0,
\]
with \(A=100\),
\[
B = 468 - 187.08 \times 100 + 100^2 = 468 - 18,708 + 10,000 = -8,240,
\]
which is negative. Roots are real if discriminant \(\ge 0\):

\[
D = A^2 - 4 B = 10,000 + 32,960 = 42,960 > 0,
\]
so roots are real.

Roots:

\[
t = \frac{A \pm \sqrt{D}}{2} \approx \frac{100 \pm 207.0}{2},
\]
which gives:

\[
L_y \approx \frac{100 - 207}{2} \approx -53.5, \quad L_z \approx \frac{100 + 207}{2} \approx 153.5.
\]

Logs can be negative (since logs unbounded below for small positive numbers), but real logs of positive numbers.

The magnitude of logs:

\[
\sqrt{(L_x)^2 + (L_y)^2 + (L_z)^2} \approx \sqrt{(87.08)^2 + (-53.5)^2 + (153.5)^2}.
\]

Calculate:

\[
87.08^2 \approx 7,582,
\]
\[
53.5^2 \approx 2,862,
\]
\[
153.5^2 \approx 23,562.
\]

Sum:

\[
7,582 + 2,862 + 23,562 \approx 34,006.
\]

Square root:

\[
\sqrt{34,006} \approx 184.44.
\]

This approximate value suggests the answer \(\approx 184.4\).

Below is the Python code to perform such enumeration and output the possible answers:

```python
import math

# Constants
ln10 = math.log(10)
S = 81 * ln10  # sum of logs
A_values = [2.035, 100, 746.285]  # sample A's within feasible interval

for A in A_values:
    B = 468 - S * A + A ** 2
    D = A ** 2 - 4 * B
    if D < 0:
        continue  # no real roots
    sqrt_D = math.sqrt(D)
    L_y = (A - sqrt_D) / 2
    L_z = (A + sqrt_D) / 2
    L_x = S - A

    # Compute Euclidean norm of logs
    answer = math.sqrt(L_x ** 2 + L_y ** 2 + L_z ** 2)

    print(f"A (L_y+L_z): {A:.3f}")
    print(f"B (L_y*L_z): {B:.3f}")
    print(f"L_x: {L_x:.3f}")
    print(f"L_y: {L_y:.3f}")
    print(f"L_z: {L_z:.3f}")
    print(f"Approximate sqrt sum: {answer:.2f}\n")
