[write_program]
This problem considers the equation \((-1) \times 2 \times x \times 4 = 24\), and asks to find the unique \(x\) satisfying it. The task is to write a Python program to find its solutions, especially the exact one, and to comply with the output constraints.

Since the equation simplifies directly, but the task is to programmatically discover solutions, we can enumerate \(x\) over a small range to find solutions matching the equation and determine the exact value.

```python
# The problem reduces to solving: (-1) * 2 * x * 4 = 24
# Simplify the equation: -1 * 2 * 4 * x = 24 => -8x = 24 => x = -3
# We'll programmatically verify solutions over a small range.

def main():
    for x_int in range(-100, 101):
        x = x_int  # integer candidate
        left_side = (-1) * 2 * x * 4
        if left_side == 24:
            print(f"x = {x}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script searches integer values around zero to find the solution \(x = -3\). It will print the exact solution when found, fulfilling the immediate output requirement.
