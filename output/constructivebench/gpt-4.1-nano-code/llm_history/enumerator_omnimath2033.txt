The problem involves enumerating all functions from a finite set of 5 elements (Fin 5) to pairs of elements in Fin 6 Ã— Fin 6, with conditions that both coordinate functions are injective and that none of the pairs map to elements with equal first and second components. To assist in formulating or testing the problem, I will generate all such functions explicitly, count them, and output the count.

Since the constraints involve injectivity of projections and that no pair equals (x, x), in particular, the mapped pairs must have distinct first and second components, and all values must be unique in the image, respecting both injectivity constraints.

Because the explicit enumeration of all such functions can be very large, I'll use small sample values for enumeration and keep track only of the count, which can guide the conjecture or proof.

```python
from itertools import permutations, product

# Domain size
n = 5
# Codomain size for first and second components
m = 6

# Generate all pairs where first != second (to satisfy the no (x, x) condition)
valid_pairs = [(x, y) for x in range(m) for y in range(m) if x != y]

# Store counts
count = 0

# For injectivity of the first and second components, their images must be permutations of distinct sets
# of size 5 on finite sets of size 6 for each coordinate.

# Generate all choices of 5 distinct first elements
first_element_choices = permutations(range(m), n)
# Generate all choices of 5 distinct second elements
second_element_choices = permutations(range(m), n)

for first_choices in first_element_choices:
    for second_choices in second_element_choices:
        # For each pair of chosen sequences, consider how to pair them up
        # Only pairs where pairs are distinct, no repeats
        for pairing in permutations(zip(first_choices, second_choices)):
            # pairing is a permutation of pairs
            pairs = list(pairing)
            # Check no pair has equal components (though it's checked beforehand), the condition is already satisfied
            # as we only select pairs from pairs with distinct components
            # The injectivity of projections is ensured by distinctness of the sequences
            # Count this valid function
            count += 1
            # Output each valid function (mapping from 0..4 to pairs)
            # print(pairs)  # Uncomment to see each function

# Print total number of such functions
print("Total valid functions:", count)
```
