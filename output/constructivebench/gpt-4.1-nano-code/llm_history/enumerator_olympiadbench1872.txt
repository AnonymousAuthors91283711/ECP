This problem is a mathematical inequality involving real numbers, exponents, and a parameterized constant. The core of the task is to find the minimal value of `a` such that for all `x`, the inequality holds. Given the structure, this resembles problems of bounding functions using inequalities and possibly leads to an extremal value of `a`. Since the original code is in Lean and the problem is about when an inequality holds, I will attempt to approximate the critical value of `a` numerically for small `n`, specifically for small `N` (which depends on `n`), and then insofar as possible, produce a candidate answer for the minimal `a`.

Given the constraints, I will:

- Choose small `n` (e.g., 1, 2, 3) to evaluate.
- For each `n`, compute `N = 2^n`.
- Search for the minimal `a` such that the inequality holds for all `x` in a reasonable range.

Since the problem involves a universal quantification over all real `x`, I will approximate by testing a dense set of `x` values in a domain where the inequality might be tight or easiest to violate, e.g., near 1, large `x`, and small `x`. 

The code will:
- Loop over selected `n` and compute `N`.
- Use a binary search or optimization over `a` to find the minimal `a` for which the inequality holds over sampled `x` values.
- Report each candidate `a` immediately when found (streaming output).

Here's the code:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

# Function to check if the inequality holds for all x in a sample
def inequality_holds(a, n, x_values, N):
    for x in x_values:
        left = math.sqrt(((x ** (2 * N)) + 1) / 2) ** (1 / N)
        right = a * (x - 1) ** 2 + x
        if left > right + 1e-8:
            return False
    return True

# Selecting small n, then N, then sampling x
for n in [1, 2, 3]:
    N = 2 ** n
    print(f"Testing for n={n}, N={N}")
    # Sample x in a range, including near 0, 1, and large x
    x_values = np.linspace(0.1, 10, 50)
    # Binary search for minimal a
    low, high = 0.0, 10.0
    for _ in range(50):  # finer binary search
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        if inequality_holds(mid, n, x_values, N):
            high = mid
            print(f"Candidate a found: {mid}")
        else:
            low = mid
    minimal_a = high
    print(f"Approximate minimal a for n={n}: {minimal_a:.6f}")
```
