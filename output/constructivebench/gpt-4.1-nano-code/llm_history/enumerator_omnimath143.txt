This problem involves a function `omnimath143_answer` related to counting sequences with specific modular difference constraints. To analyze and conjecture about `omnimath143_answer`, I will implement an enumeration of sequences, sample small `n` values, and check the counts that satisfy the conditions. 

Given the complexity, I'll:
- Select small values for `n` (like 3, 5, 7, since `n` is odd).
- Loop through all sequences `seq : Fin (n+1) â†’ Fin n` with fixed boundary conditions.
- Check if sequence satisfies the conditions.
- Count how many sequences meet the criteria.
- Print each count immediately for each `n`.
- No hardcoded answers, searching for patterns.

Because the problem hints at combinatorics and modular differences, this enumeration approach should help in building conjectures.

```python
import itertools

def is_valid_sequence(seq, n, is_partB):
    # Check boundary condition
    if seq[-1] != seq[0]:
        return False
    # Check difference constraints
    for i in range(n):
        diff = (seq[i+1] - seq[i]) % n
        if is_partB:
            # For Part B, differences should not be (i+1) or 2*(i+1)
            if diff == (i+1) % n or diff == (2*(i+1)) % n:
                return False
        else:
            # For Part A, differ constraints only to (i+1)
            if diff == (i+1) % n:
                return False
    return True

# Main enumeration
def enumerate_sequences(n, is_partB):
    count = 0
    # Generate all sequences with fixed start (choose 0)
    # or all sequences, then filter; since the sequence is from Fin(n+1) to Fin(n),
    # and Fin(n) = {0,...,n-1}
    all_vals = range(n)
    for seq_tuple in itertools.product(all_vals, repeat=n+1):
        # Check boundary condition
        if seq_tuple[-1] != seq_tuple[0]:
            continue
        # Check sequence constraints
        if is_valid_sequence(seq_tuple, n, is_partB):
            count += 1
            print("Sequence:", seq_tuple)
    print(f'n={n}, isPartB={is_partB}, count={count}')

# Sample small n values
for n in [3, 5, 7]:
    for is_partB in [False, True]:
        enumerate_sequences(n, is_partB)
```
