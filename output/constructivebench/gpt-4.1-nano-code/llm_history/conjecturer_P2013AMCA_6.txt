18. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the total made points are multiples of 3, consistent with the sum of three-pointers and two-pointers. The total points when all attempts are converted maximally align at 18, assuming the sum of attempts is 30. The highest total points achievable under the constraints is 18.
