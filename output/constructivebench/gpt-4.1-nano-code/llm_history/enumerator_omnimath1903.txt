The problem appears to involve finding the least natural number `n` such that there exists a list `s` of 0s and 1s with length `n`, satisfying certain recursive conditions. Given the complexity, Iâ€™ll focus on enumerating `n` values along with appropriate `s`. Specifically, I will:
- fix small `n` values
- enumerate all `s` of length `n` composed of 0s and 1s
- check the conditions Algorithmically
- printing the candidate solutions immediately for partial results
- stop at the first minimal `n` fulfilling the constraints

Let's implement a brute-force search over small `n`, quickly checking conditions to approach the minimal answer.

```python
# Explanation:
# We will check for increasing values of n starting from 1 upwards.
# For each n, generate all binary lists s of length n.
# For each s, simulate the folding process described:
#   - Initialize clipboard=0, count=1
#   - For each element k in s:
#       - If k=0: clipboard stays same, count is unchanged
#       - If k=1: clipboard becomes clipboard + count
#   - Check if final count >= 2018
#   - Also ensure that every 1 in s occurs after at least one 0
# If such an s is found for a given n, print n and s, then stop.

import itertools

n = 1
while True:
    found = False
    for s in itertools.product([0,1], repeat=n):
        count = 1
        clipboard = 0
        # simulate folding
        for k in s:
            if k == 0:
                # clipboard unchanged
                pass
            elif k == 1:
                clipboard += count
        total = count + clipboard
        # check conditions
        if total >= 2018:
            # check the position condition for 1's
            positions = [i for i, val in enumerate(s) if val == 1]
            # ensure every 1 occurs after a 0
            valid = True
            for pos in positions:
                if not any(s[j]==0 for j in range(pos)):
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                print(f"n={n}, s={s}")
                found = True
                break
    if found:
        break
    n += 1
```
