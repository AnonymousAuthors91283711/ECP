The problem involves enumerating sets \(S \subseteq \mathbb{N}\) where each element \(n\) can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 3 with exponents less than \(n\). Our goal is to find the number of such \(n\) within the range 1 to 1000.

The sum \(\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} 3^{t_i}\) with distinct \(t_i\) less than \(n\) resembles numbers generated by sums of distinct powers of 3, which are a subset of all possible sums of powers of 3 up to some exponent.

Because the exponents \(t_i\) are distinct and less than \(n\), the sum corresponds to all numbers that can be expressed as sums of distinct powers of 3 with exponents less than \(n\).

This set essentially includes all numbers with a ternary representation of only 0s and 1s (i.e., numbers whose base-3 representation contains only 0s and 1s).

For each \(n\in [1, 1000]\), the question asks whether \(n\) can be written as a sum of distinct powers of 3 with exponents less than \(n\). Since the exponents are less than \(n\), and we are considering all sums with exponents less than or equal to \(n-1\), the set of such sums is all numbers with ternary digits 0 or 1, up to the largest sum less than \(3^n\).

Specifically, numbers that can be represented solely with 0s and 1s in base 3 are all numbers in the interval [1, \(2^{\text{number of ternary digits}}\)], meaning they are all numbers with ternary digits of 0 and 1 with length less than or equal to the number of digits.

To get the count efficiently:

- For each \(n\), we generate all sums of the form \(\sum_{i=0}^{k} b_i 3^i\) where each \(b_i \in \{0,1\}\) and the sum is less than or equal to 1000.
- We count how many of these are between 1 and 1000.

Let's implement a program to enumerate and count these sums:

```python
# Enumerate numbers formed by sums of distinct powers of 3 with exponents less than 10 (to cover sums up to 1000)
# Since 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, sums with up to 6 digits can reach beyond 1000.
# We'll generate all sums of subset of {3^0, 3^1, ..., 3^6}.

target_max = 1000
powers_of_3 = [3 ** i for i in range(10)]  # Generate powers of 3 up to exponent 9
sums = set()

def generate_sums(index, current_sum):
    if current_sum > target_max:
        return
    if index == len(powers_of_3):
        if 1 <= current_sum <= target_max:
            print(current_sum)
        return
    # Include powers_of_3[index]
    generate_sums(index + 1, current_sum + powers_of_3[index])
    # Exclude powers_of_3[index]
    generate_sums(index + 1, current_sum)

generate_sums(0, 0)
# Count unique sums in range
count = sum(1 for s in sums if 1 <= s <= 1000)
print(f"Total count of sums within 1..1000: {count}")
```
