theorem P2023AIMEII_1 :
  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | ∃ (a d : ℕ),
    let seq := fun k => a + k * d
    seq 5 = 2 * seq 0 ∧
    (Finset.range 6).sum (fun k => seq k) = 990 ∧
    n = seq 5}
  P2023AIMEII_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 220. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sequence is arithmetic with sum constraint, and seq 5 = 2 * seq 0, so a + 5d = 2a. Solving yields d = a/5. Sum of first 6 terms: 6a + 15d = 990. Substitute d: 6a + 15*(a/5) = 990 → 6a + 3a = 990 → 9a = 990 → a = 110. Then d= 110/5= 22. With a=110, seq 5= a + 5d= 110+ 110=220. The maximum n equals seq 5=220. 
Thus, the answer is simply 220, matching the enumeration.
