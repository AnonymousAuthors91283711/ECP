. Enumerated answers: w: 2.6667, perimeter: 21.3333, area: 21.3333. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The problem shows a rectangle with width w and length l = 3w, with perimeter and area both equal to k.  
Given the enum, perimeters and area are equal, leading to the quadratic equation, solving yields k = 8w. Since w ≈ 8/3, substitute back.  
The consistent value for k that satisfies all conditions is 8w = 8 * 8/3 = 64/3.  
Final answer: <<<8 / 3>>>
