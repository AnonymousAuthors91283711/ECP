Ground Truth Answer: 518
Proposed Answer: 100 * 2 + 10 * 1 + 10
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a specific combination of m, n, p where:
   - m is squarefree and positive
   - n and p are positive
   - The final answer is in the form 100m + 10n + p

2. The ground truth answer is 518, which would correspond to:
   - m = 5 (since 100*5 = 500)
   - n = 1 (since 10*1 = 10)
   - p = 8 (since 1*8 = 8)
   - 500 + 10 + 8 = 518

3. The proposed answer is 100*2 + 10*1 + 10 = 220:
   - This would correspond to m=2, n=1, p=10
   - While this is a valid combination, it doesn't match the ground truth answer of 518

4. The problem requires solving a system of equations involving geometric series and roots, and the correct solution leads to m=5, n=1, p=8.

The proposed answer is incorrect as it gives a different numerical result (220 vs 518) and doesn't satisfy the underlying mathematical conditions of the problem.
