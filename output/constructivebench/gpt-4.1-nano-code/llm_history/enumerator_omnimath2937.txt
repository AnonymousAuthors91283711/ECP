The goal appears to be solving for `omnimath2937_answer` such that:

\[ 3 \times 3 \times 5 \times 5 \times 7 \times 9 = 3 \times 3 \times 7 \times omnimath2937\_answer \times omnimath2937\_answer \]

Let's first compute the left side:

\[ 3 \times 3 \times 5 \times 5 \times 7 \times 9 \]

And then, identify `omnimath2937_answer` such that:

\[ \text{Left} = 3 \times 3 \times 7 \times \left( omnimath2937\_answer \right)^2 \]

To do so, we'll:
- Compute the total product.
- Divide both sides by `3 * 3 * 7` to get the square of the answer.
- Check if the division yields a perfect square.

Here's the program:

```python
# Program to compute omnimath2937_answer based on the given equation

import math

# Calculate the original product
product_original = 3 * 3 * 5 * 5 * 7 * 9

# denominator for deriving the square term
denominator = 3 * 3 * 7

# Calculate the value that omnimath2937_answer^2 must equal
candidate_squared = product_original // denominator

print(f"Total product: {product_original}")
print(f"Candidate squared value: {candidate_squared}")

# Check if candidate_squared is a perfect square
answer = int(math.isqrt(candidate_squared))
if answer * answer == candidate_squared:
    print("omnimath2937_answer =", answer)
else:
    print("No perfect square found for the answer.")
```
