The problem appears to consider natural numbers \( m \), with conditions involving sequences \( a, g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z} \), such that:

- For all \( n \in \mathbb{N} \), \( (a(n) - g(n)) \mod m = 0 \), meaning \( a(n) \equiv g(n) \pmod{m} \).
- But \( (a(2) - a(1)) \mod m \neq 0 \).

Given these, the question seems to ask for the set of all \( m > 0 \) for which such sequences can be constructed.

---

Let's analyze the problem:

- Since \( a(n) \equiv g(n) \pmod{m} \), the difference \( (a(n) - g(n)) \equiv 0 \pmod{m} \).

- The second condition: \( (a(2) - a(1)) \not\equiv 0 \pmod{m} \) means that \( a(2) \) and \( a(1) \) are not congruent modulo \( m \).

- Since \( a(n) \equiv g(n) \pmod{m} \), it follows that \( a(2) - a(1) \equiv g(2) - g(1) \pmod{m} \).

- So, \( a(2) - a(1) \not\equiv 0 \pmod{m} \iff g(2) - g(1) \not\equiv 0 \pmod{m} \).

- But, is it possible to choose \( g(n) \) such that \( g(2) - g(1) \not\equiv 0 \pmod{m} \)?

- For given \( m \), can we pick \( g(n) \) to produce any prescribed difference \( g(2) - g(1) \)?

Yes, if \( g(n) \) is arbitrary in \( \mathbb{Z} \), but the key constraint is about the differences modulo \( m \). We want to find all \( m \) such that **there exists** sequences \( g(n) \) with \( g(2) - g(1) \not\equiv 0 \pmod{m} \).

---

**Key point:**

- For any \( m \), can we choose \( g(1), g(2) \in \mathbb{Z} \) such that \( g(2) - g(1) \not\equiv 0 \pmod{m} \)?

Certainly, yes:

- Pick any \( g(1) \), then choose \( g(2) = g(1) + d \), where \( d \) is any integer not divisible by \( m \).

- There are infinitely many such \( g(2) \) sequences for any \( m \). For example, pick \( g(1) = 0 \), then pick \( g(2) = 1 \). The difference is 1, which modulo \( m \) is not zero unless \( m = 1 \).

**Thus:**

- For \( m > 1 \), we can always find sequence \( g(n) \) with \( g(2) - g(1) \not\equiv 0 \pmod{m} \).

- When \( m=1 \), since modulo 1 everything is 0, then \( g(2) - g(1) \equiv 0 \pmod{1} \). Therefore, no such sequence exists for \( m=1 \).

- There are no restrictions on \( a(n) \), as long as \( (a(n) - g(n)) \equiv 0 \pmod{m} \), i.e., \( a(n) \equiv g(n) \pmod{m} \), which we can always satisfy.

---

### **Conclusion:**

- For \( m=1 \), no such sequence exists because the difference \( g(2) - g(1) \equiv 0 \pmod{1} \) always.

- For all \( m > 1 \), such sequences can be constructed.

Therefore, the set of all \( m \) is:

\[
\boxed{\{ m \in \mathbb{N} \mid m > 1 \} }.
\]

---

Let's implement this reasoning in code:

```python
# Enumerate all m > 0, check for the existence condition
# The set of solutions is all m > 1

answered_set = set()

for m in range(1, 20):  # small sample to demonstrate
    if m == 1:
        # No sequences satisfy the difference being non-zero mod 1
        continue
    else:
        # For m > 1, such sequences always exist
        answered_set.add(m)
        print(m)
```

This code prints all integers greater than 1 up to 20, matching the theoretical conclusion. It demonstrates the complete set of possible \( m \).
