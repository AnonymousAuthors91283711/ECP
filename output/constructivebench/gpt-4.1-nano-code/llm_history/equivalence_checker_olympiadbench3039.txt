Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 0
Since the problem is about finding the cardinality of a solution set to a system of equations, and both the ground truth answer and proposed answer are marked as "sorry" (which typically means "unspecified" or "to be filled in later" in theorem proving contexts), we cannot determine their equivalence. The proposed answer "0" would mean there are no solutions, but without seeing the actual ground truth answer or any working steps, we cannot verify this claim.
