This problem defines a recursive function `a(n)` involving modulo 2012, starting with `a(0)=0`, and then for `n+1`, `a(n+1) = (a(n) + n + 1) % 2012`. The goal is to find `a(2012)`. The sequence resembles cumulative sums modulo 2012.

To determine `a(2012)`, we note that:
- `a(n+1) = (a(n) + n + 1) % 2012`
- Starting with `a(0)=0`, the sequence accumulates the sum of integers from 1 up to n, mod 2012.

Thus, `a(n)` is equivalent to the sum of first `n` integers, modulo 2012:
```plaintext
a(n) = (0 + 1 + 2 + ... + n) % 2012
     = (n(n+1)/2) % 2012
```

Our task reduces to computing `(2012*2013/2) % 2012`.

Construct the code to compute `(n(n+1)/2) % 2012` for `n=2012`:
```python
# Compute a(n) = (n*(n+1)//2) % 2012 for a given n
n = 2012
value = (n * (n + 1) // 2) % 2012
print(value)
```

This directly yields the answer. Since the sequence is deterministic and the calculation straightforward, no exhaustive enumeration is necessary.

```python
# Compute the value of a(2012) based on the analysis
n = 2012
answer = (n * (n + 1) // 2) % 2012
print(answer)
```
