noncomputable abbrev omnimath1431_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1431 : 
  sin (1998 + 237) * sin (1998 - 1653) = omnimath1431_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: sin(2235°) = 0.965925826289068
sin(345°) = -0.2588190451025207
Product = -0.24999999999999983. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern indicates the product of sines simplifies to about -0.25, which matches \((\sqrt{3}/2) \times (1/2) = \sqrt{3}/4 \approx 0.433/4 = 0.10825\), but considering the signs, it aligns with \(-1/4\). 

Final expression matches the approximated product value:

<<<-1/4>>>
