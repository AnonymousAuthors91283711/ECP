The problem involves finding the greatest k such that there exists some a > 0 with all numbers of the form 2^{x a n} - 1 (for n from 1 to k) being prime. The sequence x a n is defined recursively, with initial values x a 0=0, x a 1= a, and x a (n+1) = 2 * x a n + 1.

Since primes of the form 2^{x a n} - 1 are known as Mersenne primes, and they typically occur for small exponents, we focus on small a and small n to find feasible primes.

We will:
- Fix small values of a, starting from 1.
- For each a, check increasing values of n from 1 upwards.
- For each n, compute x a n and test whether 2^{x a n} - 1 is prime.
- Stop when the sequence breaks (non-prime found).
- Record the maximum n for each a; then find the overall maximum.

```python
import math

def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    if num in (2, 3):
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return False
    sqrt_n = int(math.isqrt(num))
    for i in range(3, sqrt_n + 1, 2):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def x(a, n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return a
    else:
        return 2 * x(a, n - 1) + 1

max_results = []
# Limit search within small parameters - a=1..3, n up to 30
for a in range(1, 4):
    count = 0
    for n in range(1, 31):
        exp = x(a, n)
        candidate = 2 ** exp - 1
        if is_prime(candidate):
            count = n  # n is prime
        else:
            break
    max_results.append((a, count))
# Find the maximum n over all a
max_a, max_n = max(max_results, key=lambda t: t[1])
print(f"Maximum sequence length: n={max_n} for a={max_a}")
# Also output the corresponding primes
for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    exp = x(max_a, n)
    prime_candidate = 2 ** exp - 1
    print(f"a={max_a}, n={n}, x={exp}, 2^{exp}-1={prime_candidate} (prime={is_prime(prime_candidate)})")
```
