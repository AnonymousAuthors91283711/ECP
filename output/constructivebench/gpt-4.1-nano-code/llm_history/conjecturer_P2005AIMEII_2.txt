. Enumerated Answers: 27 35. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
The error arises because in Lean, tuples should be enclosed with parentheses and separated by a comma, i.e., (a, b), not just a comma-separated list. The current syntax `27, 35` is invalid for defining a tuple. The corrected form should be `(27, 35)`. Additionally, since `abbrev P2005AIMEII_2_answer : ℕ × ℕ := sorry`, we need to assign a pair `(27, 35)` in parentheses to match the expected tuple type. 

Furthermore, I observe that the problem involves calculating a probability with the numerator and denominator being integers and confirming their coprimality. The initial calculations suggest the favorable case as `6 * (Nat.factorial 3)^3` and total as `Nat.choose 9 3 * Nat.choose 6 3 * Nat.choose 3 3`. The candidate answer `(27, 35)` seems reasonable, given these calculations, and aligns with the enumeration.

Final answer:
<<<(27, 35)>>>

The reasoning is that the syntax correction is necessary to properly define a tuple in Lean, and the choice `(27, 35)` fits the pattern obtained from enumerated solutions and the expected output format.
