This problem involves enumerating sets of size 3 of points in an 8×8 grid with the property that any two points are either aligned horizontally, vertically, or along the main diagonals (with the same difference in coordinates). The key is to systematically generate all such triples, check the property, and count them, ultimately determining the total number of such sets.

To approach this, rather than hardcoding or assuming answers, we'll generate all 3-point subsets of an 8×8 grid, and then check the given property for each set. Since the grid points can be represented as pairs `(x, y)` with `x, y` in `Fin 8`, and there are 64 points, we are selecting 3 points out of 64—a manageable task with efficient pruning.

The code enumerates all triples, filters those satisfying the condition, and counts them. It also streams each valid triple for verification.

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Generate all points in 8x8 grid: x, y in 0..7
points = [(x, y) for x in range(8) for y in range(8)]

# Function to check the property for a set of 3 points
def check_triplet(triplet):
    for q in triplet:
        for q_prime in triplet:
            if q != q_prime:
                if not (q[0] == q_prime[0] or q[1] == q_prime[1] or abs(q[0] - q_prime[0]) == abs(q[1] - q_prime[1])):
                    return False
    return True

# Enumerate all combinations of 3 points
valid_sets = []
for combo in combinations(points, 3):
    if check_triplet(combo):
        print(combo)
        valid_sets.append(combo)

# Output the total count
print(f"Total valid sets: {len(valid_sets)}")
```
