The problem involves finding the smallest number \( n \) in the set \( S \), where \( S \) consists of sums of three distinct powers of two, such that there are exactly 99 elements in \( S \) less than \( n \). To approach this, we'll generate numbers of the form \( 2^x + 2^y + 2^z \) with distinct \( x,y,z \), sort them, and count how many are less than each candidate. The goal is to find the minimal \( n \) where exactly 99 smaller elements exist.

We'll select small exponents \( x,y,z \), enumerate all such sums, sort them, and find the one with 99 smaller elements. Since the number involves large enumeration, we'll prioritize small exponents to keep it manageable.

```python
# Generate all numbers of the form 2^x + 2^y + 2^z with distinct x,y,z up to some max exponent
max_exp = 10  # limit to keep computations small
sums = set()
for x in range(max_exp):
    for y in range(x+1, max_exp):
        for z in range(y+1, max_exp):
            val = 2**x + 2**y + 2**z
            sums.add(val)

# Convert to sorted list
sums_list = sorted(sums)

# Find the minimal n with exactly 99 elements less than n
for i in range(99, len(sums_list)):
    if i == 99:
        candidate_n = sums_list[i]
        print(candidate_n)
        break
```
