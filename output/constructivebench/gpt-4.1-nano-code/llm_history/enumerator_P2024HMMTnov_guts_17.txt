The problem involves counting the number of subsets `s` of a `4×4` grid with a covering property: for each `(i, j)` in `Fin 5 × Fin 5`, there exist `(k, l)` in `s` such that `(k, l)` covers `(i, j)` or its neighbor, with `(k, l)` constrained to `i-1` or `i` in rows, `(l-1)` or `l` in columns, and `k, l` in `0..3`. Effectively, `s` must "cover" an extended `5×5` grid with "neighbors" in the `4×4` grid.

Since the size bounds are small, we can iterate over all subsets of the `4×4` grid, check the coverage condition, and count the valid sets.

This enumeration helps verify the count or find an explicit number, which may be the answer.

```python
from itertools import combinations, product

# Define grid size
grid_size = 4
extended_size = 5  # for i,j in Fin 5

# Generate all points in the 4x4 grid
points = list(product(range(grid_size), repeat=2))
# Generate all points in the 5x5 grid
all_points = list(product(range(extended_size), repeat=2))

# Function to check if a set s covers all points in 5x5 grid
def covers(s, point):
    i, j = point
    # For each point (i,j), check existence of (k,l) in s
    for k in [i-1, i]:
        for l in [j-1, j]:
            if 0 <= k < grid_size and 0 <= l < grid_size:
                if (k, l) in s:
                    break
        else:
            continue
        break
    else:
        return False
    return True

# Enumerate all subsets of the 4x4 grid
valid_counts = 0
total_subsets = 0
for r in range(len(points) + 1):
    for subset in combinations(points, r):
        s = set(subset)
        # Check coverage
        if all(covers(s, point) for point in all_points):
            print(s)
            valid_counts += 1
        total_subsets += 1

print(f"Total valid sets: {valid_counts}")
```
