Let's analyze the problem carefully. We have a function \( f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{Z} \) defined based on the fractional part of its argument:

- If \( r - \lfloor r \rfloor < 0.5 \), then \( f(r) = \lfloor r \rfloor \).
- If \( r - \lfloor r \rfloor > 0.5 \), then \( f(r) = \lfloor r \rfloor + 1 \).
- If \( r - \lfloor r \rfloor = 0.5 \), then \( f(r) = \lfloor r \rfloor \) or \( \lfloor r \rfloor + 1 \).

The problem asks for triplets \( (a,b,c) \in \mathbb{Q}^3 \), with \( a > b > c \), such that for **all** integers \( n \):

\[
f(n a) + f(n b) + f(n c) = n
\]

and additionally, for all such triplets, the triple belongs to a set \( omnimath4381_answer \).

**Key insight:**
Since \( f(r) \) depends only on the fractional part of \( r \), the condition:

\[
f(n a) + f(n b) + f(n c) = n
\]

must hold **for all integers \( n \)**.

- \( n a \), \( n b \), \( n c \) are scaled versions of \( a, b, c \).
- The values of \( f(n a) \), etc., depend only on fractional parts of \( n a \), etc.

Because \( \lfloor r \rfloor \) changes with \( r \), and the fractional part repeats periodically, **the periodicity** suggests that the fractional parts \( \{ a \}, \{ b \}, \{ c \} \) (mod 1) are critical.

---

### Approach for enumeration:

- We choose small rational candidate values for \( a, b, c \). To ensure \( a > b > c \), and they are rational.
- For simplicity, select small fractions with small denominators, e.g., fractions with denominators ≤ 4.
- For each candidate triplet \( (a, b, c) \), verify whether the summation condition holds for \( n = 1, 2, \dots, N \), for some small N (say N=10).
- Due to the periodic nature, if the sum condition holds for enough small \( n \), it strongly suggests it holds for all \( n \).

---

### Implementation plan:
- Generate small rational triplets \( (a,b,c) \), with denominator ≤ 4, respecting \( a > b > c \).
- For each triplet, verify the condition for \( n \in \{1,\dots,10\} \).
- If it holds, print the triplet.

Let's implement this in code!

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Generate candidate rationals between certain bounds
def generate_rationals(max_den=4):
    rationals = []
    for denominator in range(1, max_den + 1):
        for numerator in range(0, denominator + 1):
            frac = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
            rationals.append(frac)
    return sorted(set(rationals))

# Define the function f based on the fractional part
def f(r):
    frac_part = r - int(r)
    if frac_part < 0.5:
        return int(math.floor(r))
    elif frac_part > 0.5:
        return int(math.floor(r) + 1)
    else:
        # fractional part exactly 0.5
        # According to the definition, f(r) can be either floor(r) or floor(r)+1
        # For testing, choose floor(r), but recognize that both are possible
        return int(math.floor(r))

import math

# Check if for a given triplet, the sum condition holds for n in 1..max_n
def check_triplet(a, b, c, max_n=10):
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        sum_f = f(n * a) + f(n * b) + f(n * c)
        # Since the sum should equal n for all n, check if equal
        if sum_f != n:
            return False
    return True

# Main enumeration
def main():
    rationals = generate_rationals()
    answers = []
    for a in rationals:
        for b in rationals:
            for c in rationals:
                if a > b > c:
                    if check_triplet(a, b, c):
                        print(f"Triplet found: a={float(a):.2f}, b={float(b):.2f}, c={float(c):.2f}")
                        answers.append((a, b, c))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Notes:**
- The code generates candidate rationals with small denominators.
- It tests triplets for the sum condition up to \( n=10 \).
- Triplets satisfying this are printed immediately.
- This exploration can help in conjecturing the structure of solutions.

*This program can be extended or refined further if needed.*
