This problem involves defining a set \( S \) as the intersection of all sets \( T \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \) such that:
- \( 0 \in T \),
- for every \( x \in T \), both \( 3x \) and \( 3x + 1 \) are in \( T \).

The task is to find the cardinality of the set of integers in \( S \) between 0 and 2007 inclusive.

Let's analyze the problem logically first:

- \( S \) is the intersection over all such \( T \). So, \( S \) contains exactly the elements common to all sets \( T \) satisfying the given properties, i.e., the minimal such set.
- Because every \( T \) contains \( 0 \) (by definition), and from \( 0 \), since \( 3 \times 0 = 0 \) and \( 3 \times 0 +1=1 \) are in \( T \), and by repeating the property, \( T \) must contain all numbers generated by starting at 0 and repeatedly applying the transformations \( x \to 3x \) and \( x \to 3x + 1 \).
- The minimal such set \( S \) is thus the set of all integers obtainable from 0 via arbitrary sequences of multiplying by 3 or multiplying by 3 and adding 1.
- This process generates all integers that can be represented in the form with base 3 digits 0 or 1, starting from 0.

It turns out that:
- \( S = \{x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \) has a base-3 representation with digits only 0 or 1\} (since we start from 0 and only append 0 or 1 digits in base 3 at each step).

Now, to count the number of such integers within [0, 2007], we can:
- Generate all numbers with base-3 digits 0 or 1, less than or equal to 2007.
- Count how many such numbers are in the set.

Let's implement enumerating all integers \( x \) in \([0, 2007]\) whose base-3 representation contains only 0 and 1 digits.

```python
# Generate all numbers with base-3 digits 0 or 1, up to 2007.
# The number is built by considering all combinations of 0/1 digits in base 3.
# We perform a BFS over possible digit strings, converting to decimal.

def generate_numbers(limit):
    from collections import deque
    results = set()
    queue = deque([0])  # start with 0
    while queue:
        num = queue.popleft()
        if num > limit:
            continue  # prune numbers exceeding the limit
        results.add(num)
        # Generate next numbers by appending 0 or 1 in base-3
        for digit in (0, 1):
            new_num = num * 3 + digit
            if new_num <= limit:
                queue.append(new_num)
    return results

numbers_in_S = generate_numbers(2007)
print(f"Count of numbers in S within [0, 2007]: {len(numbers_in_S)}")
for num in sorted(numbers_in_S):
    print(num)
```
