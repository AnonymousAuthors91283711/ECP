theorem P2002AMCB_3 : 
  Nat.card {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ Nat.Prime (n^2 - 3*n + 2)} = P2002AMCB_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=3, n^2 - 3n + 2 = 2 (prime)
Total solutions found in range 1 to 20: 1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The only n satisfying prime condition is n=3, since (3)^2 - 3*3 + 2 = 2 is prime. For n ≠ 3, the value factors as (n-1)(n-2), which is composite unless n=3. Total count within range 1 to 20 is 1.
