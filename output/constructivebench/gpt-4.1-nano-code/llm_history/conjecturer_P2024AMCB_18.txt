. Enumerated Answers: Sum of F(n) for n=1 to 10: 143
Answer based on Fibonacci sum formula: 143. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
In Lean, the abbreviation `P2024AMCB_18_answer` should be defined as a natural number, not as an equation with `=`. The error occurs because we placed the entire expression and an equality into the abbreviation, which Lean does not accept. Instead, the answer should be just the number that sums the Fibonacci-like sequence F(n) from 1 to 10, which is known to be 143 based on the pattern of Fibonacci sums and the given initial conditions. 

The pattern suggests that F(n) forms the Fibonacci sequence with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, and F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2) for n≥3. The sum from n=1 to 10 is known to be 143, as derived from Fibonacci sum formulas, which states that sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers starting with F(1)=1, F(2)=1 is F(n+2)-1. For n=10, this sum is F(12)-1 = 144-1=143.

Therefore, the correct abstracted answer in Lean is just the number 143, and the theorem confirms the sum matches this.
