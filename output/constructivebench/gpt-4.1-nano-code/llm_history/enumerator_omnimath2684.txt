The problem involves summing all two-digit numbers (from 10 to 99) for which 109 mod x = 4. We need to find all such x in that range and then sum these x values. 

Step-by-step:
- Iterate over all x in [10..99].
- Check if 109 % x == 4.
- Collect all x satisfying this condition.
- Sum and output each candidate x as the answer.

Since the sum is of x, not 109 or others, and the problem is to find all such x, I will enumerate and output each valid x, then sum these at the end.

```python
# Enumerate all x from 10 to 99
results = []
for x in range(10, 100):
    if 109 % x == 4:
        print(x)
        results.append(x)

# Compute the sum of all found x
answer = sum(results)
print('Sum:', answer)
```
