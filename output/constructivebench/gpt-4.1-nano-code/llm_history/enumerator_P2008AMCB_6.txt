The problem involves determining the value of `P2008AMCB_6_answer`, which is related to the distance covered by a certain number of steps. Given the constants:

- totalSteps = 44 * 100000 + 50000 = 4,450,000
- stepsPerMile = 1800
- distance = totalSteps / stepsPerMile

Our goal is to find the value `m` that minimizes `|distance - m|`. Since `distance` is not necessarily an integer, the closest integer candidates are usually the floor and the ceiling of `distance`.

I will write a program that:
- Calculates `distance`.
- Enumerates the two closest integers.
- Prints their absolute difference from `distance`.
- Identifies which one is closer and sets that as the answer.

```python
# Compute total steps and distance in miles
total_steps = 44 * 100000 + 50000  # 4,450,000
steps_per_mile = 1800
distance = total_steps / steps_per_mile

# Determine closest integers to the distance
floor_dist = int(distance)  # floor
ceil_dist = floor_dist + 1 if distance - floor_dist > 0 else floor_dist

# Compute differences
diff_floor = abs(distance - floor_dist)
diff_ceil = abs(distance - ceil_dist)

# Decide which is closer
if diff_floor <= diff_ceil:
    answer = floor_dist
else:
    answer = ceil_dist

# Output the answer
print(answer)
```
