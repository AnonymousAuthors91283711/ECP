Ground Truth Answer: fun ⟨x, y⟩ => 15 - y / x
Proposed Answer: fun xy => xy.1 + xy.2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest value in the set {z | ∃ x y, 2 ≤ x ≤ 5 ∧ 10 ≤ y ≤ 20 ∧ z = f(x,y)} where f is some function, and claims this maximum is 13.

2. The ground truth answer suggests f(x,y) = 15 - y/x
   - For x=2, y=20: f(2,20) = 15-10 = 5
   - For x=5, y=10: f(5,10) = 15-2 = 13
   - This matches the theorem's claim that 13 is the maximum

3. The proposed answer suggests f(x,y) = x + y
   - For x=5, y=20: f(5,20) = 25
   - This clearly exceeds 13 and doesn't match the theorem's claim

The proposed answer gives completely different results than the ground truth and contradicts the theorem's statement.
