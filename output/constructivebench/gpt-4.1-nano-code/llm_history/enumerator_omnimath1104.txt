This problem is about finding the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that there exist some \( a > 0 \) with the property that \( uparrow a 6 \,\bmod\, n \neq uparrow a 7 \,\bmod\, n \), where \( uparrow a b \) is a power tower of \( a \) of height \( b \).

The challenge involves the rapidly growing power towers, so we choose small values of \( a \) and compute their towers for heights 6 and 7, then check for a small \( n \) that distinguishes these two values modulo \( n \). The minimal \( n \) is at least 1, but because all the towers are huge, initial possibilities are small.

We will:
- Fix small \( a \), for example 2, 3, 4, etc.
- Compute \( uparrow a 6 \) and \( uparrow a 7 \).
- Test small \( n \) starting from 2 upwards for the difference.

The code performs a brute-force search for \( n \) starting from 2, checking if \( uparrow a 6 \not\equiv uparrow a 7 \pmod n \).

```python
# Program to find the minimal n such that uparrow a 6 â‰  uparrow a 7 mod n, for some a > 0.
# We try small a values, compute the towers, then check small n values until a difference is found.

def uparrow(a, b):
    # Compute a tower of height b
    result = 1
    for _ in range(b):
        result = a ** result
    return result

# List of small a values to test
a_values = [2, 3, 4, 5]

# For each a, compute towers and test small n
for a in a_values:
    val6 = uparrow(a, 6)
    val7 = uparrow(a, 7)
    # Start from n=2 upwards
    n = 2
    while True:
        if (val6 % n) != (val7 % n):
            print(f"Found n={n} for a={a}: {val6} mod {n} != {val7} mod {n}")
            break
        n += 1
        # Limit search to prevent infinite loops
        if n > 10000:
            print(f"No difference found up to n=10000 for a={a}")
            break
```
