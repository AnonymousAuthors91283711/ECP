This problem involves finding the least possible value of \(z = x^2 + 16 y^2\), subject to the constraint \(3x + 4y = 10\). Since it involves a quadratic form and a linear constraint, it resembles a constrained optimization problem. 

To find the minimum \(z\), we can parametrize the line \(3x + 4y = 10\) and then analyze \(z = x^2 + 16 y^2\). The best approach is to select samples of \(x\) and \(y\) satisfying the constraint and evaluate \(z\). We'll check a predefined grid over potential \(x\), derive \(y = (10 - 3x)/4\), compute \(z\), and track the minimum value. This enumeration will help us conjecture the true minimum.

```python
# Enumerate candidate solutions for x in a small range
samples = []
min_z = None
min_point = None

# Set a small range around the expected values
for x_int in range(-10, 11):
    x = x_int
    y = (10 - 3*x) / 4
    z = x**2 + 16*y**2
    print(f"x = {x}, y = {y:.2f}, z = {z:.2f}")  # stream results
    if min_z is None or z < min_z:
        min_z = z
        min_point = (x, y)

print(f"Candidate minimum z = {min_z:.2f} at x = {min_point[0]}, y = {min_point[1]:.2f}")
```
