The pattern from enumerated answers suggests that the minimal n for such a configuration relates more to the combinatorial structure, possibly derived from a chain or subset relations. Given the problem's nature, the lower bounds are generally minimal with respect to the structure of nested or intersecting sets. For n < 7, such a configuration is unlikely, but at n=7, the combinatorial complexity suffices for the existence of the subset sequence. 

Final answer: <<<7>>>
