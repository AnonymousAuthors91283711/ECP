The problem appears to involve finding the smallest natural number greater than 72 that has the same prime factors as 72. To solve this, we need to:

1. Factorize 72 into its prime factors.
2. Generate numbers larger than 72 with the same prime factors.
3. Find the smallest such number greater than 72.

Prime factorization of 72: \( 72 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \).  
Possible candidates are numbers formed by \( 2^a \times 3^b \) with \( a \ge 3, b \ge 2 \), and the number > 72.

We will systematically generate such numbers in ascending order starting from just above 72, for small exponents to keep the output manageable.

```python
# Generate numbers with same prime factors as 72: 2^a * 3^b, where a >=3, b >=2
# Find the smallest number >72 with these constraints.

# Prime factors: 2 and 3
primes = [2, 3]
# Exponent bounds, starting from the minimal exponents in 72
min_exps = [3, 2]

# We'll search for candidates with small exponents until we find the minimal >72
candidates = []
for a in range(3, 10):
    for b in range(2, 10):
        num = (2 ** a) * (3 ** b)
        if num > 72:
            candidates.append((num, (a, b)))
# Find the minimal candidate >72
if candidates:
    answer = min(candidates, key=lambda x: x[0])[0]
    print(answer)
```
