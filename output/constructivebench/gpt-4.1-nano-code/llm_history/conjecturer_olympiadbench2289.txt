theorem olympiadbench2289 (θ : ℝ) :
  θ ∈ Icc 0 (2*π) ∧ (fun a => 2*a^2 - 3*a + 1) (logb (1/2) (sin θ)) = 0 ↔ θ ∈ olympiadbench2289_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Theta ≈ 0.785 radians, sin θ = 0.707, log_base_half(sin θ) ≈ 0.500, polynomial ≈ -0.000
Theta ≈ 2.356 radians, sin θ = 0.707, log_base_half(sin θ) ≈ 0.500, polynomial ≈ 0.000. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
Given the approximations and conditions, θ ≈ π/4 or 3π/4, with sin θ ≈ 1/√2 and log_b(sin θ) ≈ 0.5; the polynomial is near zero at these points.
