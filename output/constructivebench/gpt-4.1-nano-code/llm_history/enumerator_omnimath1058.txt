[write_program]
The problem seems to involve finding a maximum size subset (likely related to intersecting sets or partitions) given parameters k and n with the constraints 2 ≤ k ≤ n. The `omnimath1058_answer` function appears to compute the size of such a set, and the theorem states that this is the greatest such value with certain properties.

To assist with conjecture and understanding, I will implement a Python program that enumerates feasible values for the maximum size based on small sample parameters. Given the complexity, a practical approach is to iterate over plausible set sizes and generate candidate solutions that satisfy the properties—particularly the mutual intersecting condition and the delicate conditions about differing elements and unique correspondences.

This enumeration will focus on small parameters relevant for initial conjecturing, for example, small n and k (like n=4, k=3), and will explore set sizes up to a threshold. Since the exact solution is complicated, this program will output candidate maximum sizes that satisfy the constraints. Note: This code is a rough below-interpretation to support reasoning rather than an exact algebraic solution.

```python
# Enumerate possible maximum sizes for the set S of subsets with properties resembling the problem constraints.
# For small n and k, try set sizes from a threshold down to 1, checking if constraints are met.
# Focus on simplicity: generate sets of subsets of {1, 2, ..., n} of size k, and check the intersecting and uniqueness conditions.
