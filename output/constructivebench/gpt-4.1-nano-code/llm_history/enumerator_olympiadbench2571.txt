Let's analyze and enumerate the possible solutions step-by-step:

Given:
- \( a \) is the average of three consecutive multiples of 3 centered at \( 3k \).
- The same \( a \) is related to four consecutive multiples of 4 plus 27.
- The sequence involving these multiples has minimum and maximum values with their average equal to 42.

From the description:
1. Sum of three consecutive multiples of 3:
   \[
   3k + 3(k+1) + 3(k+2) = 3k + 3k + 3 + 3k + 6 = 9k + 9
   \]
   Average (since sum divided by 3):
   \[
   a = \frac{9k + 9}{3} = 3k + 3
   \]
   
2. Sum of four consecutive multiples of 4:
   \[
   4m + 4(m+1) + 4(m+2) + 4(m+3) = 4m + 4m + 4 + 4m + 8 + 4m + 12 = 16m + 24
   \]
   Average:
   \[
   a + 27 = \frac{16m + 24}{4} = 4m + 6
   \]
   So:
   \[
   a + 27 = 4m + 6 \Rightarrow a = 4m - 21
   \]
   
3. The seven integers:
   \[
   [3k, 3(k+1), 3(k+2), 4m, 4(m+1), 4(m+2), 4(m+3)]
   \]
   
4. The min and max:
   - Minimum: \( \min(3k, 3k+3, 3k+6, 4m, 4m+4, 4m+8, 4m+12) \)
   - Maximum: as above.

Since 3k multiples are smaller or equal when \( 3k \leq 4m \), and vice versa, we need to consider cases for which the min and max are determined by the relative size of \( 3k \) and \( 4m \).

- From \( a = 3k + 3 \)
- From \( a = 4m - 21 \)

Set equal:
\[
3k + 3 = 4m - 21 \Rightarrow 3k = 4m - 24
\]
\[
k = \frac{4m - 24}{3}
\]
For \( k \) to be integer:
\[
4m - 24 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}
\]
Since 4 mod 3 = 1:
\[
(1) \times m - 0 \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \Rightarrow m \equiv 0 \pmod{3}
\]
Let \( m=3n \). Then:
\[
k = \frac{4 \times 3n - 24}{3} = \frac{12n - 24}{3} = 4n - 8
\]

Find the values of \( a \):

\[
a=3k+3=3(4n -8)+3=12n - 24 + 3=12n - 21
\]

Similarly,
\[
a=4m - 21=4 \times 3n -21=12n - 21
\]
consistent.

Next, check the condition:
\[
\frac{\min + \max}{2} = 42
\]
Possible pairs for min and max:

- min could be the smallest of the sequence: \( 3k \) or \( 4m \). Since \( 4m= 12n \), \( 3k= 3(4n -8)=12n - 24 \).

Compare:

- \(3k=12n - 24\)
- \(4m=12n\)

Thus, \(3k < 4m\) always since \(12n - 24 < 12n\), for \(n\) integers.

So, the min is \(3k=12n - 24\), max among the other is \(4m + 12= 12n + 12\), as \(4m + 12= 12n + 12\).

Sequence order:
\[3k= 12n - 24\]
\[3(k+1)= 12n - 24 + 3 = 12n - 21\]
\[3(k+2)= 12n - 18\]
\[4m= 12n\]
\[4m+4= 12n + 4\]
\[4m+8= 12n + 8\]
\[4m+12= 12n + 12\]

Minimum: \(12n - 24\),
Maximum: \(12n + 12\).

Summation:

\[
\frac{(12n - 24) + (12n + 12)}{2} = 42
\]
\[
\frac{24n - 12}{2} = 42
\]
\[
12n - 6 = 42
\]
\[
12n=48 \Rightarrow n=4
\]

Now, find \( a \):

\[
a=12n - 21= 12 \times 4 - 21=48 - 21=27
\]

Finally, check earlier relations:
\[
a=3k+3
\]
\[
k=4n -8 = 4 \times 4 -8=16 -8=8
\]
\[
3k + 3= 3 \times 8 + 3=24 +3=27
\]
Consistent.

And
\[
a=4m - 21
\]
\[
m=3n=12
\]
\[
4 \times 12 -21=48-21=27
\]
Also consistent.

Hence, the unique solution is:

\[
a=27
\]
