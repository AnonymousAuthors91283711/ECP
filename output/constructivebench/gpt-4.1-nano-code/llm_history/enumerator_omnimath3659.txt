This problem involves finding the largest size of a subset \(S\) within the interval \([1, 1000]\) such that:
- \(S\) is a subset of the interval \([1, 1000]\),
- \(|S| = k\),
- \(S\) contains no pair of distinct elements \(x, y\) with \(x + y \in S\).

This is a classical problem related to sum-free sets, where no two elements sum to another element in the set. The maximal size of such a subset in \([1, N]\) is well-studied and relates to the fact that for large sets, the maximum sum-free subset size approximately corresponds to a third of the total numbers.

In our implementation, to help conjecture the maximum size, we'll examine the set of sum-free subsets by respecting the constraints, focusing on sum-free subsets formed from the upper part of the interval (\(> N/2\)). The classic construction of large sum-free sets involves choosing all numbers greater than \(N/2\).

Given the constraints, we'll approximate the largest sum-free set within \([1, 1000]\). Since it's known that the set of all numbers greater than 500 up to 1000 is sum-free (because the sum of any two such numbers exceeds 1000), the maximum size will be approximately 500.

We will enumerate such sets of size \(k\) for \(k\) approaching this upper bound:

```python
# Enumerate candidate sum-free sets within [1, 1000] primarily consisting of 
# numbers greater than 500, which are sum-free because any sum exceeds 1000.
# We will generate sets of size k from the interval 501 to 1000.

def generate_sum_free_sets(min_start, max_end, max_size):
    for size in range(max_size, 0, -1):  # check larger sizes first
        # Generate all combinations of size 'size' in the upper half
        from itertools import combinations
        for s in combinations(range(min_start, max_end + 1), size):
            s_set = set(s)
            # Verify sum-free condition: no x + y in s where x != y
            # Break early if any sum is in s
            if all(x + y not in s_set for x in s for y in s if x != y):
                print(f"Sum-free set of size {size} found: {sorted(s)}")
                # Return the size of the maximal sum-free set
                return size
    return 0

# For N=1000, the large sum-free set can be constructed from numbers > 500
# The maximum sum-free set has size approximately 500 (integers 501..1000).
max_size_found = generate_sum_free_sets(501, 1000, 500)
print("Approximate maximum size of sum-free set in [1, 1000]:", max_size_found)
```
