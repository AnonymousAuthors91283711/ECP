Candidate sum: (-6+0j). Expected Answer Type: Set ℂ
Given the cyclic symmetry and the equations, the candidate sum that satisfies all the conditions is likely the one with real parts canceling or summing to zero. The consistent candidate sum, based on enumerations, is -6 + 0j. Generalizing, the sum simplifies to the set containing this real number, as all conditions are symmetric and the problem is cyclic.
