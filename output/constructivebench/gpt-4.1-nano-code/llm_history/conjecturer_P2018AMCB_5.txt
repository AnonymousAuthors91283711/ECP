. Enumerated answers: 240. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The set s must be subset of {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} and contains at least one prime p from this set. To maximize ncard s, we include all non-empty subsets containing one prime from the set of 4 primes {2,3,5,7}. The number of subsets with at least one prime: total subsets of 8 elements minus subsets without primes: 2^8 - 2^{4} = 256 - 16 = 240. 

Answer:

<<<240>>>
