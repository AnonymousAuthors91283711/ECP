The problem involves solving for positive real numbers \(a, b, c\) given specific exponential equations involving logarithms, then determining their sum.

Step-by-step:
- Rewrite each equation to find expressions for \(a, b, c\).
- Use properties of exponents and logs to simplify.
- Recognize patterns indicating that the exponents relate to powers, possibly simplifying to familiar constants.
- Approximate or rewrite in terms of known powers to identify the sum.

Let's analyze each equation:
1. \(a^{\frac{\log 7}{\log 3}} = 27\)
2. \(b^{\frac{\log 11}{\log 7}} = 49\)
3. \(c^{\frac{\log 25}{\log 11}} = \sqrt{11}\)

Note that:
- \(27 = 3^3\)
- \(49 = 7^2\)
- \(\sqrt{11} = 11^{1/2}\)

Express each in terms of exponents:
- \(a^{\frac{\log 7}{\log 3}} = 3^3\)

Recall, for any positive \(x\):
\[
a = \exp\left(\frac{\log 3^3}{\frac{\log 7}{\log 3}}\right)
\]
but more straightforward:

From \(a^{\frac{\log 7}{\log 3}} = 3^3\)

Raise both sides to the reciprocal:
\[
a = \left(3^3\right)^{\frac{\log 3}{\log 7}}
= 3^{3 \cdot \frac{\log 3}{\log 7}} = \exp\left(\log 3 \cdot 3 \cdot \frac{\log 3}{\log 7}\right)
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
a = \exp\left(3 \cdot \frac{(\log 3)^2}{\log 7}\right)
\]
Similarly for \(b\):
\[
b^{\frac{\log 11}{\log 7}}=7^2
\]
\[
b = \left(7^2\right)^{\frac{\log 7}{\log 11}}=7^{2 \cdot \frac{\log 7}{\log 11}}= \exp\left(\log 7 \cdot 2 \cdot \frac{\log 7}{\log 11}\right)= \exp\left(2 \frac{(\log 7)^2}{\log 11}\right)
\]

And for \(c\):
\[
c^{\frac{\log 25}{\log 11}} = 11^{1/2}
\]
\[
c = \left(11^{1/2}\right)^{\frac{\log 11}{\log 25}}= 11^{\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\log 11}{\log 25}}= \exp\left(\frac{1}{2}\log 11 \cdot \frac{\log 11}{\log 25}\right) = \exp\left(\frac{(\log 11)^2}{2 \log 25}\right)
\]

Calculating the sum:
\[
a + b + c
\]

In the code, we'll use approximate logarithms to compute numerical values for \(a, b, c\) and their sum, then output \(a + b + c\).

```python
import math

# Compute each term based on the derived formulas
a = math.exp(3 * (math.log(3) ** 2) / math.log(7))
b = math.exp(2 * (math.log(7) ** 2) / math.log(11))
c = math.exp((math.log(11) ** 2) / (2 * math.log(25)))

# Output each value and their sum for conjecture
print("a =", a)
print("b =", b)
print("c =", c)
print("a + b + c =", a + b + c)
```

This code immediately streams the approximate answer for the sum of \(a, b, c\), assisting in conjecturing the exact value based on the derived algebraic forms.
