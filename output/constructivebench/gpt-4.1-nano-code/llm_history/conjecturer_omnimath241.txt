Since the sets are 8 in total, each of size 6, and pairwise disjoint with no four sets sharing a common element, the minimal n that accommodates all such sets is when each element appears in exactly two sets (to satisfy the size and disjointness constraints). There are 8 sets, each of size 6, so the total element count is 8*6=48, and each element appears twice, so total element appearances are 2 * number of distinct elements, giving 48. Thus, total elements n = 48/2 = 24. The minimal n satisfying these conditions is 24.
