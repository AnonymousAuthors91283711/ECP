[write_program]
This problem, originating from a high-school contest, involves finding all integer triplets (x, y, z) such that:
- x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 8
- x + y + z = 8

To assist in conjecturing, I will write a Python script that enumerates small integer candidates for x, y, z within a reasonable range (say, from -20 to 20). It will print all solutions satisfying both equations, streaming each result immediately, prioritizing exact solutions.

```python
# Enumerate integer triplets (x, y, z) and print those satisfying:
# x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 8
# x + y + z = 8

limit = 20  # range limit for search
for x in range(-limit, limit + 1):
    for y in range(-limit, limit + 1):
        z = 8 - x - y
        # since z depends on x and y, only check for z within range
        if -limit <= z <= limit:
            if x**3 + y**3 + z**3 == 8:
                print((x, y, z))
```
