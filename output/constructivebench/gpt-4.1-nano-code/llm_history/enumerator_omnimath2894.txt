The problem appears to involve solving a linear equation involving variables \( x \) and \( y \), with a given condition \( y = 1 \), and then expressing \( x \) explicitly. The goal is to find all solutions \( x \) satisfying \( 4x - 2y + 3 = 3x + 3y \), given that \( y = 1 \).

Since \( y \) is constrained to be 1, the equation reduces to solving for \( x \):

\[
4x - 2(1) + 3 = 3x + 3(1) \implies 4x - 2 + 3 = 3x + 3
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
4x + 1 = 3x + 3
\]

and thus:

\[
4x - 3x = 3 - 1 \implies x = 2
\]

The code will enumerate possible solutions for \( x \) when \( y=1 \), confirming \( x=2 \). The Mathematica or Lean style hint that the solution is a unique real number \( 2 \).

```python
# Enumerate possible solutions for x given y=1 and the equation
# 4x - 2y + 3 = 3x + 3y
# with y fixed at 1, solve for x

# Set y to 1
y = 1

# The equation reduces to: 4x - 2*1 + 3 = 3x + 3*1
# Which simplifies to: 4x + 1 = 3x + 3
# Solution: x = 2

# Verify with a small check
for x_candidate in [i for i in range(-10, 11)]:  # discretized search
    lhs = 4 * x_candidate - 2 * y + 3
    rhs = 3 * x_candidate + 3 * y
    if lhs == rhs:
        print(f"Solution: x = {x_candidate}")
```
