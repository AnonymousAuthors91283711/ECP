. Enumerated answers: (2, 3, 4, 1)
(3, 2, 4, 4). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)
Given the structure p^a = 1 + 5 * q^b and the enumerated solutions, the only solutions with prime p and q are for p = 2 or 3, with the corresponding exponents. The pattern suggests these are the only solutions, and they can be expressed generally as the set containing these two tuples.
