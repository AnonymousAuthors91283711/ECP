abbrev omnimath921_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath921 :
  card {S : Finset (Fin 2014 × Fin 4) | Odd (card (image Prod.fst S : Finset (Fin 2014)))} = omnimath921_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Size 1: 10 subsets, contributes 160
Size 3: 120 subsets, contributes 491520
Size 5: 252 subsets, contributes 264241152
Size 7: 120 subsets, contributes 32212254720
Size 9: 10 subsets, contributes 687194767360
Total number of S with odd numbered first-components: 719671754912. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern of counts and contributions for each subset size, the total sums sum over odd-sized subsets. Recognizing this as a binomial sum involving powers of 2, the total count simplifies to \( 2^{2014} \times 4 \). 

Final answer in Lean:
<<<4 * 2^(2014)>>>
