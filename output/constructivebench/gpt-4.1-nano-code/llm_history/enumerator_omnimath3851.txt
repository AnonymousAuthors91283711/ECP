This problem involves finding the least positive integer \(k\) such that there exist non-empty subsets \(s_1, s_2 \subseteq \{0, 1, 2, ..., 2015\}\) with the sum of their sizes equal to \(4032 - k\), and the product of \((x - (i+1))\) over \(s_1\) is never equal to the product of \((x - (i+1))\) over \(s_2\) for any real \(x\).

To approach this computationally:

- The total sum of the sizes of \(s_1\) and \(s_2\) should be close to 4032.
- We look for pairs of non-empty subsets with sum of sizes close to that, avoiding subset pairs whose polynomial products are identical over all \(x\).
- The minimal \(k\) corresponds to the smallest difference in total subset sizes, indicating the minimal deviation from the maximum total size \(4032\).

Given the huge combinatorial size, we'll focus on small subset sizes and check for potential overlaps, approximating the answer.

        subset_polys[key] = roots
