[write_program]
This problem asks us to analyze whether for every positive integer \( d \), there exists an \( n > 0 \) such that \( \neg \operatorname{Prime}(d \times n! - 1) \), i.e., that \( d \times n! - 1 \) is composite (not prime). The goal is to understand the truth of the statement and potentially find examples to support or refute it.

To assist in the conjecture, I'll write a Python program that:
- For small values of \( d \) (say, 1 to 5), enumerates values of \( n \) starting from 1 upwards.
- Checks \( d \times n! - 1 \) for primality.
- Streams each candidate and notes whether it's prime or composite.
- Stops after a reasonable range to see patterns.

Since the problem involves factorials, I'll implement factorial efficiently and check primality with a basic method suitable for small numbers.

```python
import math

# Function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(x):
    if x < 2:
        return False
    if x in (2, 3):
        return True
    if x % 2 == 0:
        return False
    sqrt_x = int(math.isqrt(x))
    for i in range(3, sqrt_x + 1, 2):
        if x % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Enumerate over small d values to observe behavior
max_d = 5
max_n = 20  # limit to keep computations small

for d in range(1, max_d + 1):
    print(f"Trying d = {d}")
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        val = d * math.factorial(n) - 1
        prime_status = is_prime(val)
        print(f"n={n}, d*n! - 1 = {val} -> {'Prime' if prime_status else 'Composite'}")
        # Break early if composite found to observe pattern
        if not prime_status:
            print(f"Found composite for d={d}, n={n}")
            break
```
