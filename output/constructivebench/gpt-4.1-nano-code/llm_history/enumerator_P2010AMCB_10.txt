This code snippet seems to involve a problem where we need to find a real number `x` satisfying a particular equation, likely derived from an algebraic manipulation. The goal is to determine the value of `x` that makes the equation true. Given the structure, we need to:

- Compute the sum of the list `(n + 1)` for `n` from `0` to `98`.
- Set up the equation and solve for `x`.
- Enumerate possible solutions (here, the algebraic solution is straightforward).

Let's approximate with small enumeration around the plausible solution, and confirm the exact solution analytically. Because the original problem is typical for algebraic solving, the actual root is likely a rational number or simple fraction.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. Compute sum: `\sum_{n=0}^{98} (n+1)`.
2. Sum of integers from 1 to 99: `\frac{99 \cdot 100}{2} = 4950`.
3. The equation becomes:

\[
\frac{4950 + x}{101} = 100 x
\]

which simplifies as:

\[
4950 + x = 101 \cdot 100 x
\]
\[
4950 + x = 10100 x
\]
\[
4950 = 10100 x - x = (10100 - 1) x = 10099 x
\]
\[
x = \frac{4950}{10099}
\]

This fraction appears close to 0.4908, so approximate enumeration can help confirm.

Here's the Python code implementing that approach:

```python
# Enumerate candidate solutions around the approximate solution
# and confirm the exact fraction computed above.

def sum_list(range_end):
    # sum of (n+1) for n=0 to range_end-1
    return sum(n + 1 for n in range(range_end))

# sum for n=0 to 98
total_sum = sum_list(99)

# Equation: (total_sum + x) / 101 = 100 * x
# Solve for x: x = total_sum / 10099

exact_x_numerator = total_sum
exact_x_denominator = 10099
# Approximate
approx_x = exact_x_numerator / exact_x_denominator
print(f"Approximate solution x: {approx_x}")

# Enumerate rational candidates around approximate value
# Since the solution is unique, just print the exact fraction
print(f"Exact solution x: {exact_x_numerator}/{exact_x_denominator}")

# For additional verification, evaluate the equation with approximate_x
lhs = (total_sum + approx_x) / 101
rhs = 100 * approx_x
print(f"LHS: {lhs}, RHS: {rhs}")
```
