The problem appears to involve analyzing the least element in a set of related values based on a real number x less than -2. The set contains elements related to x: itself, x+2, (1/2)*x, x-2, and 2*x. When x < -2, some of these values have specific orderings, and the goal is to find the least element in that set. 

Let's analyze which element is minimal for a small sample x < -2, e.g., x = -3, and then generalize for other x values less than -2.

Given the constraints, we will:
- Pick small sample x values less than -2.
- For each, compute the set.
- Find the minimal element.
- Print the minimal element for each sample to inform our conjecture.

We'll implement this in Python, enumerating a few sample x values, computing the set, and printing the minimal element immediately.

```python
# Program to analyze the least element in the set for sample x values < -2

# Sample x values less than -2
sample_xs = [-10, -5, -3.5, -2.1]

for x in sample_xs:
    # Compute set elements
    values = [x, x + 2, 0.5 * x, x - 2, 2 * x]
    # Find the minimal element
    min_value = min(values)
    # Output the sample and the minimal element
    print(f"x = {x}: set = {values}, least element = {min_value}")
```
