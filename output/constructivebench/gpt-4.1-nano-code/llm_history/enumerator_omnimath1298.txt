The problem models a combinatorial path counting with certain parity restrictions across subsets. To aid in conjecturing and verifying the answer, I will enumerate all functions `f : Fin (n + m) → Bool` that satisfy the conditions, counting how many such functions exist. Based on the parameters `n=8` and `m=14`, the code will generate all functions, check the conditions, and count valid solutions, streaming each count and outputting the total.

This enumeration is feasible because the total length is `n + m = 22`, and therefore the total functions are `2^22 ≈ 4,194,304`, which might be on the edge but can be filtered efficiently with pruning. For demonstration, we can optimize by early pruning and small sample enumeration.

```python
from itertools import product

def main():
    n, m = 8, 14
    total_length = n + m

    valid_count = 0

    # Generate all functions: each represented as a list of booleans
    for f in product([False, True], repeat=total_length):
        x = sum(1 for i in range(total_length) if not f[i])
        y = sum(1 for i in range(total_length) if f[i])

        # Check initial conditions
        if x != n or y != m:
            continue

        def get_xk_yk(k):
            xk = sum(1 for i in range(k) if not f[i])
            yk = sum(1 for i in range(k) if f[i])
            return xk, yk

        valid = True
        for k in range(1, total_length + 1):
            xk, yk = get_xk_yk(k)
            # Check the negation of always having both odd
            if (xk % 2 == 1 and yk % 2 == 1):
                valid = False
                break

        if valid:
            valid_count += 1
            print(valid_count)

    print(f"Total valid functions: {valid_count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
