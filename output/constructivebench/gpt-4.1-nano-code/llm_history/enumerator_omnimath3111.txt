The problem defines a set \( S \) of real numbers \( y \) such that there exist \( x, z \) satisfying certain equations. We want to find the sum \( y_1 + y_2 \) (up to sign, appears as \(-(y_1 + y_2)\)), for the set \( S \) with exactly two distinct elements \( y_1, y_2 \). Our task: enumerate possible \( y \) satisfying the conditions, then identify \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \), and compute the negative sum of those two roots.

Approach:
- For each \( y \), find \( x, z \) satisfying the equations:
  - \( x + y = 7 \Rightarrow x = 7 - y \)
  - \( x z = -180 \Rightarrow z = -180 / x \) (assuming \( x \neq 0 \))
  - \( (x + y + z)^2 = 4 \Rightarrow \) substitute \( x \), \( z \):

\[ (7 - y + y + (-180 / (7 - y)))^2 = 4 \]
which simplifies to:

\[ (7 + (-180 / (7 - y)))^2 = 4 \]

- We now solve for \( y \):

Let \( t = 7 - y \). Then:

\[ (7 - 180 / t)^2 = 4 \]

which leads to:

\[ (7 - 180 / t)^2 = 4 \]

Solving for \( t \):

\[ 7 - 180 / t = \pm 2 \]

Thus,

1. \( 7 - 180 / t = 2 \Rightarrow 7 - 2 = 180 / t \Rightarrow 5 = 180 / t \Rightarrow t = 180 / 5 = 36 \]
2. \( 7 - 180 / t = -2 \Rightarrow 7 + 2 = 180 / t \Rightarrow 9 = 180 / t \Rightarrow t = 180 / 9 = 20 \)

Recall \( t = 7 - y \Rightarrow y = 7 - t \):

- For \( t=36 \), \( y = 7 - 36 = -29 \).
- For \( t=20 \), \( y = 7 - 20 = -13 \).

Check the corresponding \( z \):

- \( x = t \):
  - For \( t=36 \), \( x=36 \), \( z = -180/36 = -5 \).
  - For \( t=20 \), \( x=20 \), \( z = -180/20 = -9 \).

Verify the original equations:

- For \( y=-29 \):

  \( x + y = 36 - 29 = 7 \), okay.

  \( x z = 36 * (-5) = -180 \), okay.

  Sum \( x + y + z = 36 - 29 - 5 = 2 \), square is 4, matches.

- For \( y=-13 \):

  \( 20 - 13=7 \), okay.

  \( 20 * (-9) = -180 \), okay.

  Sum \( 20 -13 - 9= -2 \), square is 4, okay, matching.

Set \( S = \{ -29, -13 \} \), with \( y_1=-29 \), \( y_2=-13 \).

The sum \( y_1 + y_2 = -29 -13= -42 \). The answer is \( - ( y_1 + y_2) = 42 \).

Because the problem asks to enumerate solutions, this finite set is exactly two solutions; the critical sum is 42.

```python
# Enumerate solutions based on derived equations
possible_y = [-29, -13]
# Confirmed solutions produce the set S with exactly these two values
# The answer is negative of their sum:
answer = -sum(possible_y)
print(answer)
```
