Ground Truth Answer: fun x => x
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℕ => x
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is asking to simplify the expression x² + 2x - x(x + 1) and find what function it equals to.

Let's simplify the expression step by step:
1. x² + 2x - x(x + 1)
2. = x² + 2x - x² - x [expanding the multiplication]
3. = (x² - x²) + (2x - x) [regrouping terms]
4. = 0 + x
5. = x

The ground truth answer is the identity function `fun x => x`, which is exactly what we got from simplification.

The proposed answer is `fun x : ℕ => x`, which is identical in meaning to the ground truth answer - both represent the identity function that returns its input. The only difference is that the proposed answer explicitly specifies the type ℕ, which doesn't change the mathematical meaning.
