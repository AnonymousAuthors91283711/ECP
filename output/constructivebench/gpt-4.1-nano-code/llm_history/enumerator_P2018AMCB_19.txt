The problem involves finding the least possible divisor `d` of a number `n` in a certain range, with specific properties, including divisibility by 323, and ordering conditions on the divisors of `n`. The goal is to enumerate candidate numbers `n` between 1000 and 9999 that are divisible by 323 and to analyze their divisors. We look for the minimal divisor `d` such that it appears at a position in the divisor list where the next divisor after it is exactly `d`. To efficiently approach this, we will systematically generate multiples of 323 within the range and examine their divisors to find the minimal such divisor `d`.

```python
# Enumerate n in [1000, 9999] that are divisible by 323
# For each, find the sorted list of divisors and check the conditions
# Goal: Find the minimal divisor d where the next divisor after d in the sorted list is also d
# This captures the minimal such divisor satisfying the conditions

def divisors(n):
    """Return the sorted list of divisors of n."""
    divs = []
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divs.append(n // i)
    divs.sort()
    return divs

# Collect candidates for n
candidates = []
for n in range(1000, 10000):
    if n % 323 == 0:
        divs = divisors(n)
        # Check for the condition: find a divisor d where next divisor is also d
        for i in range(len(divs) - 1):
            if divs[i + 1] == divs[i]:
                continue  # unlikely, but just in case
            if i + 1 < len(divs) and divs[i + 1] == divs[i]:  # redundant
                pass
            # Since the list is sorted, check if subsequent divisor equals current
            # Actually, in a sorted list, identical adjacent elements mean divisor repeats
            # but divisors typically are unique unless n is a perfect square
            # problem states get? some 323 at position k, so no direct repeated divisors by construction
            # So perhaps we're looking for a case where the next divisor after some divisor is exactly that divisor (i.e., a repeated divisor). 
            # But since divisors are unique, probably the intended condition is:
            # "the get? k element equals 323, and get? (k+1) is some d" such that d is minimal and satisfies the property.
            # To simulate the logic, look for the position of 323 in divisors, then check the next divisor.
            pass
        try:
            k = divs.index(323)
            if k + 1 < len(divs):
                d_next = divs[k + 1]
                # Check if this d next is the same as the current (likely not, as divisors are unique)
                # Instead, if no repeated divisors, perhaps just recording d = 323 and the next divisor
                candidates.append(d_next)
        except ValueError:
            pass

# Find the minimal candidate value d
if candidates:
    d_candidates = sorted(set(candidates))
    min_d = d_candidates[0]
    print("Minimal divisor d satisfying the condition:", min_d)
