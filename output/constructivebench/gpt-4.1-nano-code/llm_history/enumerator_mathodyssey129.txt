The problem appears to describe a graph-theoretic situation involving N people with friendships (undirected, no self-friendships), assigned positive real numbers, and a "heard" value based on neighboring friends. The task is to find the least number of distinct "heard" values possible for such a configuration with N nodes, satisfying certain conditions.

To enumerate answers:
- The minimal number of distinct "heard" values depends on the structure of the friendship graph and assigned numbers.
- For small N, we can exhaustively generate candidate graphs and number assignments, then determine the number of distinct "heard" values.

Given the complexity of the problem, we'll focus on small N (say, N=4) to illustrate enumeration:
- Generate all possible simple graphs with no loops (friendship relations).
- For each graph, assign small positive numbers to nodes, attempt to compute "heard".
- Count the number of distinct "heard" values.
- Track the minimal such count.

This code will:
- Fix small N.
- Generate all graphs (via edge subsets).
- Assign numeric values with small rational approximations.
- Compute "heard" values and count distinct counts.
- Print each minimal result when found.

Note: This is a heuristic enumeration, simplified for a demonstration.
