[write_program]
The problem appears to involve finding integer values of \( n \) between 1 and 2016 such that the expression 

\[
720 \mid (1 + n + \sum_{i=1}^{6} \frac{n^i}{i!})
\]

holds true. To assist, I'll write a Python program that enumerates all candidate \( n \) in that range, computes the sum, and checks divisibility by 720. It prints each valid \( n \) immediately upon finding it. The approach prioritizes clarity and efficiency within small ranges, fitting the problem constraints.

```python
# Enumerate n from 1 to 2016 and check the divisibility condition
def main():
    valid_ns = []
    for n in range(1, 2017):
        total = 1 + n
        # Compute the sum for i=1 to 6 of n^i / i!
        for i in range(1, 7):
            # compute n^i as n**i and factorial i! as math.factorial(i)
            term = (n ** i) / __import__('math').factorial(i)
            total += term
        # Check if total is divisible by 720 (integer division)
        # Since total is a float, compare to total rounded and check integral
        if abs(total - round(total)) < 1e-10:
            total_int = round(total)
            if total_int % 720 == 0:
                print(n)
                valid_ns.append(n)
    print("Candidates n:", valid_ns)
    # For analysis, could output min/max, but here we're just enumerating all.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
