abbrev omnimath2837_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2837 :
  (8 * 6 - 4 / 2 : ℝ) = omnimath2837_answer :=
sorry
. Enumerated answers: 46.0
46. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the answer matches the arithmetic calculation directly: \(8 \times 6 - \frac{4}{2} = 48 - 2 = 46\). Since the enumerated answer is 46.0, the concise closed form should be the numerical value 46.0.

<<<46.0>>>
