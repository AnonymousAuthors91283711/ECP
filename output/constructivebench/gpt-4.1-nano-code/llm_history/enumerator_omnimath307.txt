The problem appears to involve binomial polynomials or sums of powers of monomials, and the expression involves whether a particular polynomial can be expressed as a product of simpler sums. Since the code is in Lean and involves summations over geometric series, I will generate small sample cases to test whether such factorizations exist for small positive integers \(m, n\).

Given the nature of the sums, a typical approach is to test particular small \(m, n\) values, compute the sums explicitly, and verify whether the sum over \(k\) of \(X^{n \cdot k}\) can be expressed as the product of the sum of \(X^{k}\) over \(k\) and some polynomial \(p\). Because the problem is high-school level, I will focus on small positive \(m, n\) and check for the existence of \(p\).

Program:
- Fix small \(m, n\) with \(m, n \leq 5\).
- For each pair, compute the sums.
- Attempt polynomial division from the sum over \(X^{n k}\) by the sum over \(X^{k}\) (assuming monic geometric series).
- Print whether such polynomial \(p\) exists for each pair.

This will help conjecture if the property always holds and what the polynomial \(p\) might be.

```python
# Enumerate small m, n to check the polynomial factorization
from sympy import series, Symbol, Poly, divisors, degree
from sympy.abc import X

for m in range(1, 6):
    for n in range(1, 6):
        # Sum of X^{k} for k in 0..m
        sum_m = sum(X**k for k in range(m + 1))
        # Sum of X^{n*k} for k in 0..m
        sum_nk = sum(X**(n * k) for k in range(m + 1))
        # Attempt to divide sum_nk by sum_m to find p
        try:
            q, r = Poly(sum_nk, X).div(Poly(sum_m, X))
            if r.as_expr() == 0:
                print(f"m={m}, n={n}: Sum over n*k divisible by sum over k, p = {q.as_expr()}")
            else:
                print(f"m={m}, n={n}: No exact division, so no exact polynomial p")
        except:
            print(f"m={m}, n={n}: Division failed")
```
