  IsLeast {N : ℕ | ∃ (s : Finset ℕ), 
    s.card = 2 * k + 1 ∧ 
    (∀ x ∈ s, 0 < x) ∧ 
    (∀ (t : Finset ℕ), t ⊆ s → t.card = k → t.sum id ≤ N / 2) ∧

Ground Truth Answer: fun k => 2 * k^3 + 3 * k^2 + 3 * k
Proposed Answer: fun k : ℕ => (2*k+1)*(k+1) - k
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: 2k³ + 3k² + 3k
2. Proposed: (2k+1)*(k+1) - k

Let's expand the proposed answer:
(2k+1)*(k+1) - k = 2k² + 2k + k + 1 - k = 2k² + 2k + 1

Now compare with ground truth:
2k³ + 3k² + 3k vs 2k² + 2k + 1

These are clearly different polynomials. The ground truth is cubic while the proposed answer is quadratic. They don't match for any k > 0.

For example:
- When k=1:
  Ground truth: 2+3+3=8
  Proposed: 2+2+1=5
- When k=2:
  Ground truth: 16+12+6=34
  Proposed: 8+4+1=13

<<<False>>>
