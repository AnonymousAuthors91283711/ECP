Found triplet: (a=6, b=25, c=30)
Found triplet: (a=10, b=15, c=30)
Total number of solutions: 8. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests solutions are parametrized by positive integers satisfying 6apb = c² with a < b < c ≤ 35. Observing the enumerated triplets, the solutions form a finite set with c at most 35. Their count is 8, thus the answer is a fixed natural number.

Answer: <<<8>>>
