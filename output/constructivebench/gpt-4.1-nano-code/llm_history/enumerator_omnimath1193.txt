The problem involves computing a probability based on urn compositions, with two urns and conditional probabilities. To assist in finding the answer, I will enumerate possible events based on these given values and compute the ratio of numerator and denominator as specified. Since the problem involves combinatorial and probabilistic calculations, I will generate the partial answers step-by-step.

```python
# Enumerate possible values for total urns and probabilities, then compute the ratio

# Known constants
urnA_white = 4
urnA_red = 2
totalA = urnA_white + urnA_red

urnB_red = 3
urnB_black = 3
totalB = urnB_red + urnB_black

# To avoid division by zero, ensure totalB - 1 > 0
# Compute numerator and denominator as per problem statement
problems = []

# First term in numerator: P(event1)
term1_num = 0.5 * urnA_red/totalA * 0.5 * urnB_black/totalB

# Second term in numerator: P(event2)
# Note: urnB_red/totalB * urnB_black/(totalB - 1)
# Only consider if totalB > 1
if totalB > 1:
    term2_num = 0.5 * urnB_red/totalB * 0.5 * urnB_black/(totalB - 1)
else:
    term2_num = 0

numerator = term1_num + term2_num
print(f"Numerator: {numerator}")

# Denominator components
denom_terms = []

# Term a: A red, B black
denom_terms.append(0.5 * urnA_red/totalA * 0.5 * urnB_black/totalB)

# Term b: A white, B black
denom_terms.append(0.5 * urnA_white/totalA * 0.5 * urnB_black/totalB)

# Term c: B red, B black (two draws)
# Only if totalB > 1
if totalB > 1:
    denom_terms.append(0.5 * urnB_red/totalB * 0.5 * urnB_black/(totalB - 1))
else:
    denom_terms.append(0)

# Term d: B black twice
if totalB > 1:
    denom_terms.append(0.5 * urnB_black/totalB * 0.5 * (urnB_black - 1)/(totalB - 1))
else:
    denom_terms.append(0)

denominator = sum(denom_terms)
print(f"Denominator: {denominator}")

# Compute the ratio
if denominator != 0:
    answer = numerator / denominator
    print(f"Answer: {answer}")
else:
    print("Denominator is zero, cannot compute ratio.")
```
