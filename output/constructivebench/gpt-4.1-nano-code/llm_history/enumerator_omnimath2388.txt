This problem involves counting the number of injective functions \( f: \text{Fin } 16 \to \text{Fin } 4 \times \text{Fin } 4 \) that start and end at \((0,0)\), with intermediate points forming a path in the grid that moves by one step in any of the four directions, covering all points in the grid at least once. Given the structure, it resembles counting Hamiltonian paths on a grid with certain start/end conditions and coverage constraints.

Since directly enumerating all such paths in code isn't trivial, and the problem space is manageable with small grid assumptions, we'll generate candidate paths for a small sample and verify the constraints sequentially. We will:

- Fix the grid size as \(4 \times 4\).
- Generate all permutations (paths) starting and ending at \((0,0)\),
- Ensure each interim move is a valid step, with no repeated points,
- Confirm the path visits all points at least once (the coverage condition).

Because enumerating all permutations is large (factorial scale), we'll limit our brute-force search to paths of length 16 (the total number of points in the grid), i.e., Hamiltonian paths, and look for candidate paths. We will generate a sample and print candidate paths that meet the conditions.

Here's a code sketch focusing on generating potential paths, demonstrating the enumeration process:

```python
import itertools

# 4x4 grid points
grid_size = 4
points = [(x, y) for x in range(grid_size) for y in range(grid_size)]

# Moves: up, down, left, right
moves = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

def is_adjacent(p1, p2):
    return abs(p1[0] - p2[0]) + abs(p1[1] - p2[1]) == 1

def valid_path(path):
    # Check adjacency and all points visited exactly once or at least once
    for i in range(len(path) - 1):
        if not is_adjacent(path[i], path[i + 1]):
            return False
    return len(set(path)) == len(path)  # no repeated points

# Since full permutation is large, generate permutations starting at (0, 0)
start_point = (0, 0)
# Generate permutations of the remaining points
remaining_points = [p for p in points if p != start_point]

# Limit total outputs for efficiency
max_candidates = 10
count = 0

for perm in itertools.permutations(remaining_points, len(remaining_points)):
    candidate_path = [start_point] + list(perm)
    if candidate_path[-1] == start_point and valid_path(candidate_path):
        print(candidate_path)
        count += 1
        if count >= max_candidates:
            break

# Note: This code limits enumeration and searches for specific paths; it's a demonstration.
```
