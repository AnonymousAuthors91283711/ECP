The problem appears to involve finding the minimum value of `a` such that `a + 4b + 9c = 529`, with `a > 0`, `b ≥ 0`, and `c ≥ 0`. To do this efficiently, I'll enumerate all non-negative `c` values, then for each, solve for `a + 4b = 529 - 9c`, and for each such sum, find the minimal `a` that satisfies the constraints.

Since the goal is to find the least `a` with the conditions, I'll iterate over possible `c` values from 0 up to `floor(529/9)` (which is 58), then for each, iterate over `b` such that `4b ≤ remaining`, determine the minimal `a`, and report the global minimum across all.

```python
# Enumerate values for c
min_a = None
min_solution = None
for c in range(0, 60):  # c up to 59 to cover all possibilities
    remaining = 529 - 9 * c
    if remaining < 0:
        break
    for b in range(0, remaining // 4 + 1):
        sum_ab = remaining - 4 * b
        a = sum_ab
        if a > 0:  # a must be > 0
            print(a)  # Immediate output when a candidate is found
            if (min_a is None) or (a < min_a):
                min_a = a
                min_solution = (a, b, c)
# Optional: after enumeration, print the minimal answer
# (In the context of the problem, stream output is used, so this is just for completeness)
print("Minimum a:", min_a)
```

This code efficiently enumerates all non-negative `(b, c)` combinations such that `a` is positive, and outputs each suitable `a`. It tracks the absolute minimum `a` found, fulfilling contest-like streaming output requirements.
