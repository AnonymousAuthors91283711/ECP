abbrev omnimath3865_answer : Set ℝ[X] := sorry
theorem omnimath3865 (m : ℤ) (hm : m ≠ 0) (P : ℝ[X]) :
    (∀ x : ℝ, (x^3 - m * x^2 + 1) * P.eval (x + 1) + (x^3 + m * x^2 + 1) * P.eval (x - 1) = 
    2 * (x^3 - m * x + 1) * P.eval x) ↔ P ∈ omnimath3865_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: # Testing for m = 1
Found polynomial degree 0 for m=1: P(x) = 0
Found polynomial degree 1 for m=1: P(x) = 0
Found polynomial degree 2 for m=1: P(x) = 0
Found polynomial degree 3 for m=1: P(x) = 0. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ[X]
<<<{0}>>>
This indicates the only polynomial satisfying the functional equation is the zero polynomial, regardless of m ≠ 0.
