The problem involves calculating a specific probability involving two random variables, with given probabilities for their outcomes. To verify or explore the probability expression, we can enumerate all scenarios based on the parameters and compute the probability terms explicitly.

Since the probabilities are defined concretely in the code, we can assign values to these parameters and enumerate all possible outcomes, summing the relevant terms where conditions are met. 

We choose small, representative values for the parameters, for example:
- p_heads = 1/2
- p_tails = 1/2
- p_uniform = p_tails
- p_xy_uniform = p_tails * p_tails

Then, enumerate all combinations of outcomes for x and y: 0 (heads) or 1 (tails), and whether they are uniform or not, and compute the total probability by summing contributions from all satisfying conditions.

This approach is efficient because it:
- Uses explicit probabilities
- Limits enumeration to only four pairs (x, y)
- Checks the conditions directly

Here's the Python code that performs this enumeration:

```python
# Enumerate scenarios for x and y:
# x in {0, 1}, y in {0, 1}
# p_heads = p_0, p_tails = p_1

p_heads = 1/2
p_tails = 1/2
p_uniform = p_tails
p_xy_uniform = p_tails * p_tails

results = []

for x in [0, 1]:
    for y in [0, 1]:
        # Compute probability components:
        p_x = p_heads if x == 0 else p_tails
        p_y = p_heads if y == 0 else p_tails
        
        prob_contribs = 0
        # Check conditions:
        # |0-1| > 1/2 or |1-0| > 1/2
        if abs(x - y) > 1/2:
            prob_contribs += p_x * p_y
        
        # x=0, y uniform > 1/2, which implies y is uniform:
        if x == 0:
            prob_contribs += p_x * p_uniform * (1/2)
        # x=1, y uniform < 1/2:
        if x == 1:
            prob_contribs += p_x * p_uniform * (1/2)
        # y=0, x uniform > 1/2:
        if y == 0:
            prob_contribs += p_uniform * p_y * (1/2)
        # y=1, x uniform < 1/2:
        if y == 1:
            prob_contribs += p_uniform * p_x * (1/2)
        # Both uniform:
        if abs(x - y) > 1/2:
            prob_contribs += p_xy_uniform * (1/4)

        print(f"Scenario x={x}, y={y} yields probability {prob_contribs}")
        results.append(prob_contribs)

# Sum all contributions:
total_prob = sum(results)
print(f"Total probability estimate: {total_prob}")
```

This code directly enumerates possible outcomes for x and y, evaluates the conditions, computes the contributions, and outputs each scenario's contribution immediately. It helps us verify the probability expression concretely and explore solutions efficiently.
