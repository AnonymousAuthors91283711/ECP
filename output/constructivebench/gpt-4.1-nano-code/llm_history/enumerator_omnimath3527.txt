This problem involves finding a specific natural number `omnimath3527_answer` that satisfies several conditions. The key points are:

- It should **not** be factorizable into two integers greater than 1 (i.e., it should be *not* composite with factors > 1).
- It should be divisible into two factors > 1 for the products 6, 27, 39, and 77.

Let's analyze:
- For the products 6, 27, 39, 77, factors > 1 exist.
- The number `omnimath3527_answer` must **not** be factored into larger-than-1 factors, so it's likely prime or 1 (but 1 isn’t greater than 1, so only prime).

In particular:
- 6 factors into (2,3)
- 27 factors into (3,9) or (1,27) etc.
- 39 factors into (3,13)
- 77 factors into (7,11)

But `omnimath3527_answer` should **not** be expressible as a product of two integers > 1, meaning `omnimath3527_answer` should be a prime (or 1, but 1 isn't > 1).

Since all the given products are composite (not primes), it suggests the answer is a prime not factorable into >1 factors.

The smallest such prime appears to be 2, 3, 5, 7, etc. But `a * b = 6` has factors > 1, so 6 is composite.

To satisfy the "¬ (∃ a,b ..." condition, `omnimath3527_answer` must be prime.

Now, let's pick small primes and check the conditions:

- For `a * b = 6`, factors: (2,3)
- for `a * b = 27`, factors: (3,9)
- for `a * b = 39`, factors: (3,13)
- for `a * b = 77`, factors: (7,11)

`omnimath3527_answer` should be a prime greater than 1, and preferably not divisible by the factors above. Let's test small primes.

The constraints for `omnimath3527_answer`:

- It must be prime (because otherwise, it could be factored into >1 factors).
- Since no specific restriction prevents `omnimath3527_answer` from being prime, let's test several small primes.

Here's the program that enumerates primes and checks the conditions:

```python
# This program searches for a prime number that meets the following:
# - Not factored into two integers > 1 (i.e., must be prime)
# - But, for the given products (6, 27, 39, 77), confirm their factorizations
# We seek a prime that is unrelated to the given product factorizations

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

# Candidates to check: Small primes > 1
for candidate in range(2, 100):  # limit to small numbers
    if is_prime(candidate):
        # candidate should not be factored into > 1 factors (it's prime by definition)
        # Now check the conditions:
        # Products: 6, 27, 39, 77
        # Verify they indeed have such factors:
        # (skipped because factors are given and expected)
        # So, just output the candidate
        print(candidate)
```

This code outputs prime numbers up to 100, suitable as candidate answers.  
Given the constraints, the answer likely is a prime not dividing the product factors, so the first prime — 2 — is a reasonable candidate output.

**Note:** The code is designed to quickly verify and list primes, which by definition can't be factored into >1 factors, fulfilling the main condition.
