Smallest n with answer 9 is n=1
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The main issue with the proposed answer is that it tries to define `omnimath966_answer` as an `if` expression depending on `n`, but `n` is not in scope in an abbreviation. Instead, we need a closed-form expression in terms of a general parameter `n`, representing the index of the summation or the minimal `k`. 

From the enumerated results, the pattern of answers matches the sequence:  
\[ \text{answer}(n) = \frac{9 \times n \times (n + 1)}{2} \]  
which corresponds to the formula for 9 times the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. 

Given the problem, `omnimath966_answer` should be a function of `n`. The theorem states there exists an `n` such that \( 9 \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) equals `omnimath966_answer`, and this `n` is minimal.

Hence, the best fitting closed-form answer for `omnimath966_answer` (assuming `n` is intended as a variable representing the increasing sequence) is:

<<<fun n : ℕ => 9 * n * (n + 1) / 2>>>

This matches the pattern in the enumerated answers and should compile correctly in Lean.

**Explanations:**
- I make `omnimath966_answer` a function `fun n : ℕ => 9 * n * (n + 1) / 2` instead of an abbreviation dependent on an undefined variable.
- The theorem then asserts the existence of a minimal `n` satisfying the equality, aligning with the enumeration where the smallest such `n` gives answer 9, 27, 54, etc.

**Final answer:**  
<<<fun n : ℕ => 9 * n * (n + 1) / 2>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Smallest n with answer 9 is n=1
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
To fix the error, recognize that `abbrev omnimath966_answer : ℕ := ...` expects an `ℕ` as its value, not a function. Your current candidate assigns a function `(n : ℕ) => 9 * n * (n + 1) / 2`, which is incompatible. 

Based on the enumerated answers, the sequence corresponds to the triangular number scaled by 9: `9 * n * (n + 1) / 2`. The problem states `∃ (n : ℕ), 9 * (n * (n + 1) / 2) = omnimath966_answer`, which suggests the answer is a specific number, the particular value for the minimal `n` (here, `n=1`, answer=9).

Thus, set `omnimath966_answer` to be the number 9 directly, representing the minimal such value, and infer `n=1` as the smallest `n`.

Corrected answer:

<<<9>>>
