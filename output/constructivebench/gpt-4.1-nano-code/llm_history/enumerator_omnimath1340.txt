The given theorem involves finding a rational number \( q = \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \), with \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{N} \), satisfying several inequalities, particularly being less than \(\frac{1}{4}\), and satisfying certain conditions on reciprocals.

The problem asks to find the *greatest* such \( q \) less than \( \frac{1}{4} \). Since the code is a formal Lean proof, and the main goal is to enumerate possible triplets \((a, b, c)\) satisfying the constraints, we're asked to write a Python program to explore candidate answers efficiently.

Below, I will write a Python script that enumerates triples \((a, b, c)\) with small parameters, computes \( q = 1/a + 1/b + 1/c \), and checks if \( q < 1/4 \). It logs each candidate as it finds it, focusing on maximizing \( q \), and lists candidates close to \( 1/4 \).

This approach helps in spotting the greatest \( q \) less than \( 1/4 \).

```python
# Enumerate small triplets (a, b, c) with 1 <= a <= b <= c
# Compute q = 1/a + 1/b + 1/c and list those less than 1/4
# Focus on candidate answers close to 1/4 for conjecture

max_q = 0
best_triplet = ()
threshold = 0.25
results = []

for a in range(1, 20):  # Small a
    for b in range(a, 20):  # b >= a
        for c in range(b, 20):  # c >= b
            q = 1 / a + 1 / b + 1 / c
            if q < threshold:
                # Keep track of the maximum q
                if q > max_q:
                    max_q = q
                    best_triplet = (a, b, c)
                # Record candidates close to threshold for analysis
                results.append((q, (a, b, c)))

# Stream candidates in order of decreasing q
for q_val, triplet in sorted(results, reverse=True):
    print(f"q = {q_val:.6f}, (a, b, c) = {triplet}")

print(f"\nMaximum q found less than 1/4: {max_q:.6f} with triplet {best_triplet}")
```
