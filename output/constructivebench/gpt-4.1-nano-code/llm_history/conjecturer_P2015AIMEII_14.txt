Based on the symmetry and pattern in the given equations, the values of \(x\) and \(y\) suggest that the expression simplifies notably. Noticing the sum of symmetric terms and the relationship involving powers, the simplified form should involve symmetric sums of \(x\) and \(y\). Given the pattern of the original equations, the final expression reduces to \(20\).
