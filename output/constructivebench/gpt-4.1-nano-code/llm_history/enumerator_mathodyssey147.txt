This problem involves finding four distinct digits \( a, b, c, d \) with specific range constraints, satisfying a particular algebraic equation. The key is to brute-force iterate over all feasible digit combinations (with the given restrictions) and check the equation for each. 

Since the constraints on the digits are small (e.g., \( a \in [1,9] \), others in [0,9], with all four distinct), we can efficiently do this with nested loops, checking for the equation's validity.

The approach:
- Iterate over \( a, b, c, d \) with the specified bounds.
- Ensure all four are distinct.
- Check if the equation holds.
- Print each matching quadruple as soon as found.

This approach will help in conjecturing and possibly discovering the solution.

```python
# Enumerate all combinations of digits a, b, c, d satisfying the constraints
for a in range(1, 10):  # a ∈ [1,9]
    for b in range(0, 10):  # b ∈ [0,9]
        if b == a:
            continue
        for c in range(0, 10):  # c ∈ [0,9]
            if c in {a, b}:
                continue
            for d in range(0, 10):  # d ∈ [0,9]
                if d in {a, b, c}:
                    continue
                # Construct the numbers
                first_num = 10 * a + b
                second_num = 100 * a + 10 * c + d
                lhs = (first_num ** c) * second_num
                rhs = 100000 * a + 10000 * b + 1000 * c + 100 * a + 10 * c + d
                if lhs == rhs:
                    print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}")
```
