This theorem concerns identifying the greatest possible value of the product of a sequence `a : (ℕ → ℝ)` with specific constraints. It requires finding the maximum of the set of all products `∏_{i=0}^{2009} a(i)` such that:
- Each `a(i) > 0` for `i` from 0 to 2009,
- For distinct `i, j` in `0..2009`, `a(i)*a(j) ≤ i + j`.

In practice, the maximum occurs when `a(i)` are chosen to satisfy equality in the constraint as much as possible, balancing the terms. To assist, we'll enumerate candidate tuples `a(i)` for small `i`, based on the problem's structure, and compute their products.

Here's a Python script that:
- Samples small `a(i)` values satisfying the constraints.
- Demonstrates the potential maximum product.

The script avoids hardcoding the exact maximum, focuses on candidates, and streams solutions.

```python
import itertools

# Parameters
n = 10  # small sample size for demonstration
max_candidates = 50  # limit to prevent explosion

# Generate candidate sequences a[i], where a[i] > 0
# For simplicity, assume a[i] close to sqrt(i + 1) to satisfy the inequality a(i)*a(j) ≤ i + j
# We explore nearby rational or floating values

candidates = []

for a_values in itertools.product(
        *[ [ (i+1)**0.5, (i+1)**0.5 + 0.1, (i+1)**0.5 - 0.1 ] for i in range(n) ] ):
    # Check constraints for all pairs
    valid = True
    for i in range(n):
        if a_values[i] <= 0:
            valid = False
            break
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if a_values[i]*a_values[j] > i + j:
                valid = False
                break
        if not valid:
            break
    if valid:
        product = 1
        for val in a_values:
            product *= val
        # Record the candidate and its product
        candidates.append((a_values, product))
        print(f"Candidate a: {a_values}\nProduct: {product}\n")
        if len(candidates) >= max_candidates:
            break

# Output the maximum product candidate found
if candidates:
    max_candidate = max(candidates, key=lambda c: c[1])
    print(f"Maximum candidate product: {max_candidate[1]}")
    print(f"Sequence: {max_candidate[0]}")
else:
    print("No valid candidates found.")
```
