This problem appears to involve solving an equation or verifying a relation involving the variable `x`, with given constraints `hx_pos: 0 < x` and `hx_lt: x < 180`. The key equation is `4 * x + 20 + 140 = 360`. Simplifying this, `4 * x + 160 = 360`, or `4 * x = 200`, which gives `x = 50`. The theorem states that `(4 * x) / 360` equals some answer `omnimath2972_answer`, which is likely a constant derived from `x`.

Since the problem is about enumerating possible answers, I will write a program that, given the constraints and this equation, computes the consistent value of `x` and then calculates `(4 * x)/360`.

The approach:
- Generate candidate `x` candidates satisfying `0 < x < 180` and `4 * x + 160 = 360`.
- Since the equation has a unique solution `x=50`, just directly compute it.
- For the enumeration, if multiple candidates existed, we'd iterate over small increments, but here it's a precise solution.

```python
# Since the problem reduces to a linear equation, the solution is unique
# x = (360 - 160) / 4 = 200 / 4 = 50

x = 50
answer = (4 * x) / 360
print(answer)
```
