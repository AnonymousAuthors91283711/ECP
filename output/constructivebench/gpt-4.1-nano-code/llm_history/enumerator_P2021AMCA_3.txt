This problem appears to have a typo or formatting error related to the theorem statement. Based on typical contest problems involving division, sums, and divisibility, it likely asks for two natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\) satisfying:

- \(a + b = 17402\)
- \(10 \mid a\)
- \(b = a / 10\)
- Find \(a - b\)

From the conditions, we have \(b = a/10\). Substituting into the sum:

\[a + \frac{a}{10} = 17402 \implies \frac{10a + a}{10} = 17402 \implies \frac{11a}{10} = 17402\]

Multiply both sides by 10:

\[11a = 174020\]

Find \(a\):

\[a = \frac{174020}{11}\]

Now, check if 174020 is divisible by 11:

- 174020 / 11 = 15820 exactly? Let's verify.

\(11 \times 15820 = 11 \times 15820 = 174020\)

Yes, \(a = 15820\).

Since \(a = 15820\), then:

\[b = a / 10 = 1582\]

Verify if \(a\) is divisible by 10:

15820 / 10 = 1582, which is an integer.

Calculate \(a - b\):

\[15820 - 1582 = 14238\]

Using these, we can define the answer as 14238.

```python
# Find all (a, b) satisfying the conditions:
# a + b = 17402
# 10 divides a
# b = a / 10
# We want to find a - b

# Since b = a/10, then a + a/10 = 17402
# => (11a)/10 = 17402
# => 11a = 174020
# => a = 174020 / 11

answers = []

# Check if 174020 is divisible by 11
if 174020 % 11 == 0:
    a = 174020 // 11
    b = a // 10
    # Verify divisibility
    if a % 10 == 0 and a + b == 17402:
        answer = a - b
        print(answer)
        answers.append(answer)
```
