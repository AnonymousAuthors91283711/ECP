This problem involves exploring all 5-tuples (V, U, Q, A, R) within the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} that are distinct (no duplicate elements) and satisfy the complex equation:

\[
\frac{(V + U + Q + A + R)^2}{V - U - Q + A + R} = V^{U^{Q^{A^{R}}}}
\]

To investigate solutions, I'll generate all permutations of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (since ordering matters and no repeats are allowed), then check which satisfy the equation.

Given the computational constraints, I'll implement an efficient generator that tests all permutations, computes both sides, and prints solutions as they are found.

Because the right side involves a tower of exponents, to prevent overflow or excessive computation, I'll limit exponentiation to small values and skip invalid (like division by zero).

The goal is to produce partial solutions immediately as they are verified, to assist in conjecture building.

```python
import itertools

# Define the set to permute
elements = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Helper function for safe power with small integers
def safe_pow(base, exp):
    try:
        return base ** exp
    except OverflowError:
        return None

# Iterate over all permutations of the 5 elements
for perm in itertools.permutations(elements):
    V, U, Q, A, R = perm
    numerator = (V + U + Q + A + R) ** 2
    
    denom = V - U - Q + A + R
    if denom == 0:
        continue  # skip to avoid division by zero
    
    left_side = numerator / denom
    # Compute the right side: V^(U^(Q^(A^R))) with small exponent limits for safety
    R_pow = safe_pow(A, R)
    if R_pow is None:
        continue
    Q_pow = safe_pow(Q, R_pow)
    if Q_pow is None:
        continue
    U_pow = safe_pow(U, Q_pow)
    if U_pow is None:
        continue
    V_pow = safe_pow(V, U_pow)
    if V_pow is None:
        continue
    
    # Check if the sides match (allow floating point tolerance for equality)
    if abs(left_side - V_pow) < 1e-9:
        print(f"Solution found: V={V}, U={U}, Q={Q}, A={A}, R={R} -> "
              f"LHS={left_side}, RHS={V_pow}")
```
