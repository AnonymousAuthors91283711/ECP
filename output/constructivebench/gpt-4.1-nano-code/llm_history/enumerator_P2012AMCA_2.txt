The problem involves evaluating the sum of two floor divisions: \(\lfloor t/20 \rfloor + \lfloor t/30 \rfloor\), at \(t=300\). To assist in conjecturing, let's enumerate possible values of the sum for \(t\) around 300, both smaller and larger, to find the exact value and understand its behavior.

Since the sum is straightforward at \(t=300\), we can check the value directly, but to follow the instructions, we'll generate surrounding values. In particular, the sums change at multiples of 20 and 30, so we can scan nearby \(t\) values for potential minimal and maximal sums.

```python
# Enumerate values of floor divisions near t=300
# We'll check t from 0 to 600 to be thorough, but focus on t near 300
max_t = 600
answer_at_300 = None
for t in range(max_t + 1):
    sum_floor = (t // 20) + (t // 30)
    # When t=300, compute the value
    if t == 300:
        answer_at_300 = sum_floor
        print(f"t={t}: sum={sum_floor}")
    # For demonstration, also print values at some key points:
    if t % 60 == 0:
        print(f"t={t}: sum={sum_floor}")

# Confirm the value at t=300
print(f"Answer at t=300: {answer_at_300}")
```

This code enumerates the sum at \(t = 0\) to \(600\), reports the value at \(t=300\), and identifies notable points where the sum jumps, corresponding to multiples of 20 and 30. You can run this to find the exact sum.
