  ∃! m : ℕ, 0 < m ∧ (2.1 : ℚ) * m = (52.8 : ℚ) ∧ m = omnimath2981_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the equation \( 2.1 * m = 52.8 \), solving for \( m \) yields \( m = \frac{52.8}{2.1} \). Simplify numerator and denominator: \( 52.8 ÷ 2.1 = 25. \) Therefore, \( m = 25 \). The answer does not depend on n, so the closed form is simply 25.
