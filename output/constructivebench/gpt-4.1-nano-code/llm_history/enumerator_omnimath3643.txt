The problem involves understanding when the sum of square roots of (n - 1) and (n + 1) is rational, for integer n. Since we are asked to enumerate possible answers without hardcoding, a good way is to test small integer n values and their corresponding sums, checking if the sum reduces to a rational number.

Given the expression: sqrt(n-1) + sqrt(n+1), for various n, we check if it is rational.

We can enumerate a small range of n (say from -10 to 10), compute the sum, check if it is rational (by seeing if it can be expressed as a fraction with small integers), and output the sum and n when the sum is rational.

Let's implement that.

```python
# Enumerate small integer n values to find when sqrt(n-1) + sqrt(n+1) is rational
from fractions import Fraction
import math

for n in range(-10, 11):
    x1 = n - 1
    x2 = n + 1
    # Skip negative values under sqrt, but note sqrt is real only for x >= 0
    if x1 < 0 or x2 < 0:
        continue
    sqrt1 = math.sqrt(x1)
    sqrt2 = math.sqrt(x2)
    total = sqrt1 + sqrt2
    # Check if total is close to a rational number with small denominator
    # We attempt to approximate total with fractions
    frac = Fraction(total).limit_denominator(1000)
    # Recompute approximation to check closeness
    approx = frac.numerator / frac.denominator
    if abs(approx - total) < 1e-8:
        # If the sum is rational enough, output n and the sum as a fraction
        print(f"n = {n}, sum of roots ≈ {total:.6f}, approximated as {frac}")
```

The problem seeks integer values n such that sqrt(n-1) + sqrt(n+1) is rational. The code attempts to find such n by checking small integer ranges and approximating the sum with rational numbers. However, the code only considers non-negative radicands (x ≥ 0) due to the sqrt constraint, and the main issue is that for negative n, the radicands become negative, which are skipped — but the problem domain may include negative n if the sum of roots is rational. Also, the code does not consider whether the sum could be rational exactly or only approximately, and it checks only within a small approximation threshold.

Additionally, the problem's Theorem states an equivalence involving the existence of rational r such that sqrt(n-1)+sqrt(n+1) = r. Since sqrt(n-1)+sqrt(n+1) can be rational only under very specific conditions, the actual solutions are limited.

The current script only searches for approximate rational values and does not accurately determine whether the sum is exactly rational. There are no printed answers, leading to an empty result.

**Judgement:**  
The code should output solutions if existing, but the current code outputs nothing because it only finds approximate matches and unlikely to find any. It is inadequate to directly judge based solely on approximation thresholds; exact solution identification is better.

Given these, I reject the original program for not conclusively finding or printing exact solutions, and because the logic about negative n values and rationality is incomplete.

**Accepted or Rejected:** <<<False>>>

**Corrected Program:**

The key point is to identify whether sqrt(n-1) + sqrt(n+1) can be rational exactly.  
Let's analyze:

Suppose sqrt(n-1) + sqrt(n+1) = r ∈ ℚ.  
Square both sides: n-1 + n+1 + 2√(n-1)(n+1) = r²  
=> 2n + 2√(n² - 1) = r²  
Since r is rational, 2n is rational, so 2√(n² - 1) must be rational, i.e., √(n² - 1) must be rational.

But √(n² -1) is rational only if n² − 1 is a perfect square. Let n² - 1 = k² for some integer k. Then,

n² - 1 =

**Assessment and Explanation:**

The provided code references a theorem involving real square roots of integers, essentially asking whether there exist an integer \( n \) and a rational \( r \) such that \(\sqrt{n - 1} + \sqrt{n + 1} = r\).

However, the "Program" section is empty, and the listed answers indicate an "Error: Program is empty," meaning no enumeration has been provided.

Without an actual enumeration or computational checks, the problem cannot be answered. The statement suggests that the theorem’s truth depends on the existence of such \( n, r \). Generally, for real square roots summing to a rational, it's a known subtlety; for example, for \(n=1\):
\[
\sqrt{0} + \sqrt{2} = 0 + \sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q}
\]
which is irrational. Similarly, for larger \(n\), the sum remains irrational unless there's a specific construction.

Given the problem's instructions—proofs, enumeration, and correctness—the setup is incomplete. Since no enumeration has been provided, and the code is invalid, the original program should be **rejected**.

**Conclusion:**

**Reject** the original as it is empty and incomplete.

**Corrected Program:**

Since the problem asks for an enumeration approach consistent with the instructions, the code below tests small integer values for \( n \) and checks if \(\sqrt{n-1} + \sqrt{n+1}\) is rational. It prints such solutions if found.

```python
import math

# Enumerate small n values to check if sqrt(n-1) + sqrt(n+1) is rational
max_n = 100  # small range for efficiency
for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    val1 = math.sqrt(n - 1)
    val2 = math.sqrt(n + 1)
    total = val1 + val2
    # Check if total is close to a rational number: here, check if its decimal part is negligible
    # Alternatively, check if total is rational by testing if total * some integer is close to an integer
    for denom in range(1, 1000):
        if abs(total * denom - round(total * denom)) < 1e-8:
            r = round(total * denom) / denom
