The problem involves analyzing the function \(f(x) = \sin^6 x + \cos^6 x - 0.7 (\sin^4 x + \cos^4 x)\) to find its zeros. To assist in conjecturing the solutions, I will write a Python program that numerically inspects the function over a range of \(x\) values within \([0, 2\pi]\). It will print exact or approximate solutions when \(f(x)\) crosses zero, by checking sampled points with sufficiently small step size and detecting sign changes.

```python
import math

# Define the function f(x) as given
def f(x):
    sin_x = math.sin(x)
    cos_x = math.cos(x)
    return sin_x**6 + cos_x**6 - 0.7 * (sin_x**4 + cos_x**4)

# Sampling parameters
start, end = 0, 2 * math.pi
step = 0.01  # small step for better resolution

x = start
previous_value = f(x)
x += step

# Search for zero crossings
while x <= end:
    current_value = f(x)
    # Check for a sign change indicating a root between x - step and x
    if previous_value * current_value <= 0:
        # Approximate root via bisection
        low, high = x - step, x
        for _ in range(50):  # refine the root estimate
            mid = (low + high) / 2
            val = f(mid)
            if val == 0 or abs(val) < 1e-12:
                break
            if previous_value * val < 0:
                high = mid
            else:
                low = mid
        root = (low + high) / 2
        print(f"Approximate root at x ≈ {root:.6f}, f(x) ≈ {f(root):.6e}")
    previous_value = current_value
    x += step
```
