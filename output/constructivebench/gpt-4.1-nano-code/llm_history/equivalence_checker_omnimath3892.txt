Ground Truth Answer: 2015 / 2
Proposed Answer:  2015
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two pairs of numbers (a,d) and (b,c) that each sum to 2015, with the additional constraint that a ≠ c.

2. We need to find all real x that satisfy the equation (x-a)(x-b) = (x-c)(x-d).

3. Expanding both sides:
   x² - (a+b)x + ab = x² - (c+d)x + cd
   Simplifying:
   (c+d - a - b)x = cd - ab

4. Using the given conditions:
   From h1: d = 2015 - a
   From h2: c = 2015 - b
   Substituting:
   [(2015-b)+(2015-a) - a - b]x = (2015-b)(2015-a) - ab
   Simplifying:
   [4030 - 2a - 2b]x = 2015² - 2015a - 2015b + ab - ab
   [4030 - 2(a+b)]x = 2015(2015 - a - b)
   Factor out 2 from left side:
   2[2015 - (a+b)]x = 2015(2015 - a - b)

5. The solution is x = 2015/2, unless (2015 - a - b) = 0, but this would imply a + b = 2015, which combined with h2 (b + c = 2015) would mean a = c, contradicting h3. Therefore, x = 2015/2 is the unique solution.

The ground truth answer (2015/2) is correct, while the proposed answer (2015) is incorrect.
