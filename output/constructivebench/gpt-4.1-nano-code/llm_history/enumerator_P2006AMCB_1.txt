Given the problem involves summing a sequence of (-1)^(k+1) from k=0 to n-1, for n=2006, the sum alternates between 1 and -1. 

For small values, the sum pattern is:  
n=1 → 1  
n=2 → 0  
n=3 → 1  
n=4 → 0  
and so forth, alternating between 1 and 0 depending on whether n is odd or even.

We can verify this pattern by enumerating sums for small n values, then deduce the formula.

```python
# Enumerate partial sums for small n to observe the pattern
for n in range(1, 11):  # small sample for pattern detection
    total = 0
    for k in range(n):
        total += (-1) ** (k + 1)
    print(f"n = {n}, sum = {total}")

# The pattern can be summarized: sum is 1 if n is odd, 0 if even.
# Therefore, define the answer function based on n's parity:
def P2006AMCB_1_answer(n):
    if n % 2 == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return 0

# Test the explicit answer for n=2006
print(P2006AMCB_1_answer(2006))
```
