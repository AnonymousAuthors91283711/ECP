[conjecture_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

open Nat Set

abbrev omnimath2502_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2502 : 
  Set.ncard {s : Finset ℕ | (∀ n ∈ s, ¬ Nat.Prime n ∧ n < 23) ∧ s.sum id = 23} = omnimath2502_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: {8, 9, 6}
{9, 10, 4}
{9, 14}
{8, 15}
Total sets: 4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the enumeration, the total number of such sets is 4. The pattern suggests that the answer is a constant number representing the total count, irrespective of set specifics, given the sum condition and primes under 23.
