132. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests the sum of eight distinct positive integers. Two sets sum to 36 and 37, close to 36, 37, and other sums near 132, 131. Testing small sums of eight positive integers suggests that the sums are 36 and 37. The set sum is either 36 or 37, which are consecutive. The set likely consists of small numbers adding up to these sums, with minimal sets at these sums.

Thus, the answer encompasses the sums 36 and 37 only.
