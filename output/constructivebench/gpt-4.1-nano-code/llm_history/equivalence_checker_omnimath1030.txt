Ground Truth Answer: 2010
Proposed Answer: 2005
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence a(n) with:
   - a(1) = 3
   - a(n+1) = (n+1)*a(n) - n for n ≥ 1

2. We're asked to find the smallest m ≥ 2005 such that (a(m+1)-1) divides (a(m)^2-1)

3. The ground truth answer is 2010, meaning:
   - For m=2010, (a(2011)-1) divides (a(2010)^2-1)
   - For all 2005 ≤ m < 2010, this divisibility condition doesn't hold

4. The proposed answer is 2005, which would mean m=2005 is the smallest satisfying the condition

The proposed answer claims that m=2005 satisfies the condition, but the ground truth shows that the actual smallest m is 2010. This means:
- Either m=2005 doesn't actually satisfy the condition (False)
- Or m=2005 satisfies it but there's an even smaller m (which contradicts the problem's requirement of m ≥ 2005)

In either case, the proposed answer is incorrect compared to the ground truth.

<<<False>>>
