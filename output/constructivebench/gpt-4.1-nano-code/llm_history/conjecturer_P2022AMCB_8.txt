theorem P2022AMCB_8 (p : ℝ × ℝ) : 
    p.2^4 + 1 = p.1^4 + 2 * p.2^2 ↔ p ∈ P2022AMCB_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solution: x=0, y=-1
Solution: x=-1, y=0
Solution: x=1, y=0
Solution: x=0, y=1. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ × ℝ)
The solutions are symmetric and correspond to points where y² equals either 0 or 1, and x takes values satisfying x⁴ + 2y² = y⁴ + 1. When y = 0, x⁴ = 1, so x = ±1; when y = ±1, x⁴ = 0, so x = 0. Thus, the answer set encompasses these points.

<<<{(x, y) | (x = 0 ∧ y = 1) ∨ (x = 0 ∧ y = -1) ∨ (x = 1 ∧ y = 0) ∨ (x = -1 ∧ y = 0)}>>>
