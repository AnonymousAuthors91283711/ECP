Proposed Answer: 6
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
We need to find the smallest natural number (omnimath3174_answer) such that there do NOT exist natural numbers a and b with 0 < a < b where (b! - a!) mod 10 equals that number.

Key Observations:
1. We're looking at factorials modulo 10
2. For n ≥ 5, n! ≡ 0 mod 10 because factorials include both 2 and 5 as factors
3. So we only need to consider factorials of 1 through 4:
   - 1! = 1
   - 2! = 2
   - 3! = 6
   - 4! = 24

Possible differences modulo 10:
- 2! - 1! = 1 ≡ 1 mod 10
- 3! - 1! = 5 ≡ 5 mod 10
- 3! - 2! = 4 ≡ 4 mod 10
- 4! - 1! = 23 ≡ 3 mod 10
- 4! - 2! = 22 ≡ 2 mod 10
- 4! - 3! = 18 ≡ 8 mod 10

Looking at digits 0-9:
- The digits that don't appear in the differences are 6, 7, 9
- The smallest is 6 (proposed answer)
- But 7 is the ground truth answer

Wait, but 6 is achievable as 5! - 4! = 120 - 24 = 96 ≡ 6 mod 10, so 6 should be possible. Therefore, 7 is indeed the smallest impossible digit.
