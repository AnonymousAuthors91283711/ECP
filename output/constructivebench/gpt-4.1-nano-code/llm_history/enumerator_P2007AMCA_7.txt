The problem appears to involve integers \(a, b, c, d, e\) with certain equal differences and a sum, leading to the value of \(c\). To assist in conjecturing the true answer, I'll enumerate plausible solutions consistent with the given difference equalities and sum constraint. Since the differences are equal, the sequence \((a, b, c, d, e)\) forms an arithmetic progression. 

Given:
- \(b - a = c - b = d - c = e - d\)

Let the common difference be \(k\). Then:
- \(b = a + k\)
- \(c = a + 2k\)
- \(d = a + 3k\)
- \(e = a + 4k\)

Sum:
\[a + (a + k) + (a + 2k) + (a + 3k) + (a + 4k) = 30\]
\[
5a + 10k = 30
\]
\[
a + 2k = 6
\]

Enumerate small integer pairs \((a,k)\) such that \(a + 2k = 6\).

For each, compute \(c = a + 2k\) and output.

```python
# Enumerate integer pairs (a, k) satisfying a + 2k = 6
# For simple integer values, choose small k in range
for k in range(-10, 11):
    a = 6 - 2 * k
    c = a + 2 * k
    print(f"a={a}, k={k}, c={c}")
```
