This problem asks us to find the number of 5-element finsets of finsets of {0,1,2,3,4,5} such that for each element i in {0,...,5}, the number of sets s in the family that contain i is even. Our goal is to enumerate all such families and count them.

Approach:
- The universe is finite (Fin 6).
- The family s is a subset of all finsets of Fin 6, with size 5.
- The key condition is that for each i, the count of sets containing i is even.

We'll fix the family size (exactly 5 sets). To keep computation manageable, we'll generate all such families, check the parity conditions, and count.

Given the constraints, the enumeration over all 5-element subsets of the power set of Fin 6 (which has size 2^6 = 64) is reasonable since C(64, 5) ~ 1.4 million, feasible with pruning.

We will:
- Generate all 5-element subsets of all subsets of Fin 6.
- Check the parity conditions for each.
- Output the count of such families.

Here's the code:

```python
from itertools import combinations, chain

def all_subsets(s):
    """Generate all subsets of set s."""
    return chain.from_iterable(combinations(s, r) for r in range(len(s)+1))

def main():
    universe = list(range(6))
    all_sets = list(all_subsets(universe))
    total_valid = 0

    # Generate all 5-element families (s)
    for s_subset in combinations(all_sets, 5):
        # Count how many sets contain each element i
        counts = [0]*6
        for t in s_subset:
            for i in t:
                counts[i] += 1
        # Check parity condition
        if all(count % 2 == 0 for count in counts):
            total_valid += 1
            print(total_valid)

main()
```
