The problem appears to involve finding positive primes \(a, b, c\), a positive integer \(k\), satisfying the equation \(a^2 + b^2 + 16 c^2 = 9 k^2 + 1\). We need to enumerate potential solutions, testing small prime combinations for \(a,b,c\) (since the primes are involved and the sum is limited). The goal is to find combinations that satisfy the equation, printing each candidate immediately.

Since the problem setup is hypothetical, my approach:
- Enumerate small prime values for \(a, b, c\).
- For each set, check whether the equation holds for some \(k > 0\).
- For solutions where the equation holds, print \((a, b, c, k)\).

To ensure efficiency, I'll limit the values of \(a, b, c\) to small primes (e.g., < 20). For each candidate, compute the RHS \(9k^2 + 1\) and check whether the LHS matches. When simplified, I can solve for \(k^2\):
\[
k^2 = \frac{a^2 + b^2 + 16c^2 - 1}{9}
\]
and verify whether \(k^2\) is a perfect square with \(k > 0\).

```python
# Enumerate small primes for a, b, c
import math

primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]

# Generate candidate solutions
for a in primes:
    for b in primes:
        for c in primes:
            numerator = a**2 + b**2 + 16 * c**2 - 1
            if numerator > 0 and numerator % 9 == 0:
                k_squared = numerator // 9
                k = int(math.isqrt(k_squared))
                if k > 0 and k * k == k_squared:
                    print((a, b, c, k))
```
