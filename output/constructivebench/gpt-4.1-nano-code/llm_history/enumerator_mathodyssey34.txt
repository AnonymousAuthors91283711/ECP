Let's analyze the problem:

We are given the set of natural numbers \( k \) such that:
- \( 0 < k \),
- \( 1991^k \mid 1990^{19911992} + 1992^{19911990} \).

and asked to find the greatest such \( k \).

Key observations:

- The divisor \( 1991^k \) is a power of 1991.

- 1990 and 1992 are adjacent to 1991, specifically:
  \[
  1990 = 1991 - 1, \quad 1992 = 1991 + 1
  \]

- Focus on the divisibility:
  \[
  1991^k \mid 1990^{A} + 1992^{A}
  \]
  where \( A = 19911992 \) or \( A = 19911990 \) (from the exponents).

- Using the binomial theorem and properties of modular arithmetic, observe:
  \[
  1990^{A} + 1992^{A} \equiv (-1)^{A} + 1^{A} \ (\text{mod } 1991)
  \]

  Since \( 1990 \equiv -1 \ (\text{mod } 1991) \),
  \[
  1990^{A} \equiv (-1)^{A}
  \]
  Similarly, \( 1992 \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod } 1991) \),
  \[
  1992^{A} \equiv 1^{A} = 1
  \]
  
So,
\[
1990^{A} + 1992^{A} \equiv (-1)^{A} + 1
\]

Now, analyze \( (-1)^{A} + 1 \):

- If \( A \) is even:
  \[
  (-1)^{A} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
  \]
- If \( A \) is odd:
  \[
  (-1)^{A} + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0
  \]
  
Given that \( A = 19911992 \) and \( 19911990 \), both are even (since ending digits are 2 and 0 respectively).

- Therefore, both exponents are even, so:
  \[
  1990^{A} + 1992^{A} \equiv 2 \pmod{1991}
  \]

Hence,
\[
1991 \nmid 1990^{A} + 1992^{A}
\]
because the sum is congruent to 2 modulo 1991, not zero.

This implies:
\[
1991^1 \nmid 1990^{A} + 1992^{A}
\]
for those large exponents—no division by 1991 is possible, thus \(k\) cannot be at least 1.

But wait, this contradicts the earlier interpretation; the congruence shows the sum is *not* divisible by 1991 itself, so no higher powers of 1991 divide the sum either.

Check carefully for the case \(k=1\):
- Since the sum ≡ 2 mod 1991, it is not divisible by 1991, so the set of \(k\) satisfying the divisibility is empty (no \(k\) > 0 will work).

Therefore, the greatest \(k\) satisfying the divisibility condition is **0**, but since \( 0 < k \), the set is empty.

**Answer:**

The set of \(k\) with divisibility is empty, so the greatest such \(k\) is 0.

Here's the program:

```python
# Since the analysis shows no positive k satisfies the condition, we output 0 directly.
# The problem's theorem asks for the greatest k > 0 satisfying the divisibility.
# Our reasoning shows none satisfy, so the answer is 0.

print(0)
