Based on the given constraints: f is non-negative, f(2)=0, non-zero between 0 and 2 (excluding 2), and satisfies the functional equation f(xf(y))*f(y) = f(x + y). The pattern suggests solutions of the form f(x) = c * (a - x)^k with specific c, a, k satisfying the conditions. The enumeration indicates candidate: f(x) = 0.5 * (2 - x)^1. Hence, the closed form is this linear function.

The errors in your proposed answer are primarily syntactic: the phrase "Based on the given constraints..." is improperly placed as an expression, and the syntax for defining the set of functions is incorrect. Since the clues from the enumerated candidate suggest a specific formula, the simplest closed-form function consistent with all constraints is f(x) = 0.5 * (2 - x).

To define this as a set of functions in Lean, I will write the singleton set {f | f(x) = 0.5 * (2 - x)} for all x, as a parametric set. In Lean, a set of functions is typically represented using set-builder notation: {f | ∀ x, f x = ...}.

Therefore, the corrected answer, enclosed with '<<< >>>', is:

The problem specifies a function \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) with several properties: non-negativity, zero at \(x=2\), non-vanishing on \((0,2)\), and a functional equation involving a product and sum. The candidate answer suggests a form like \(f(x) = \tfrac{1}{2}(2 - x)\) (or scaled variants), which fits certain criteria, particularly vanishing at 2 and being positive on \([0,2)\).

The expression \(f(x) = 0.5 * (2 - x)^1\) is a candidate, but the 'Set' of such functions cannot be directly expressed as a fixed function unless considering the set of all functions satisfying the constraints. Since the candidate answer is a particular function, the set likely contains this function.

Given that, and the structure of the problem, the set of functions could be the singleton containing this affine function, or the collection of all functions of this form. The functional equation suggests that \(f(x) = c (2 - x)\) for some constant \(c > 0\), considering the nature of the functional equation and the boundary conditions.

Therefore, a suitable definition of the set would be all functions \(f(x) = c (2 - x)\) for \(c \ge 0.5\). To keep it simple and consistent with the candidate, I will define the set as containing the particular scaled linear function \(f(x) = 0.5 * (2 - x)\), and possibly its scalar multiples.

Thus, the correct raw structure in Lean would be:

```lean
{f : ℝ → ℝ | (∀ x, 0 ≤ x ∧ x < 2 → f x ≠ 0) ∧ f 2 = 0 ∧ (∀ x, 0 ≤ x ∧ x < 2 → f x > 0) ∧
    (∀ x y, f (x * f y) * f y = f (x + y)) }
```

But since the problem asks for the set of functions matching the candidate form, I will define:

<<< fun c : ℝ => 0.5 * (2 - x) >>> 

or, more generally, the set of functions \(f(x) = c(2 - x)\) with \(c>0\).

Final answer:

<<< {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c ≥ 0.5, ∀ x, f x = c * (2 - x)} >>
