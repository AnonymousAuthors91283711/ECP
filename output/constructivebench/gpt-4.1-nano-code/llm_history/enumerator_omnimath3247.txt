This problem asks to find the value of `(3 * k) % 7` given that `k % 7 = 3`. Since `k % 7 = 3`, `k` can be written as `k = 7n + 3` for some integer `n`. Then, `(3 * k) % 7` becomes `(3 * (7n + 3)) % 7`.

We can analyze this directly:
- `(3 * (7n + 3)) % 7 = (21n + 9) % 7`.
- `21n % 7 = 0` because `21` is divisible by 7.
- So, the expression reduces to `9 % 7`, which is `2`.

Let's verify this pattern for a small range of `k` with `k % 7 = 3`, i.e., for `k = 3, 10, 17, 24, 31, ...`. Then, compute `(3 * k) % 7` for each to confirm.

```python
# Enumerate several values of k with k % 7 = 3 to verify pattern
for n in range(0, 5):
    k = 7 * n + 3
    result = (3 * k) % 7
    print(f'k = {k}, (3 * k) % 7 = {result}')
# Since pattern is consistent, answer should be 2 for all such k
print("Answer:", 2)
```
