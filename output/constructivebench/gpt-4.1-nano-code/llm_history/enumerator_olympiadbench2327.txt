The problem asks to find a unique pair of positive integers `(ab.1, ab.2)` with certain conditions, notably that their gcd is 1, their difference is 15, and their ratio lies between 5/9 and 4/7. We're to search for the pair `(a, b)` that satisfies these constraints. The ratio `(a/b)` should satisfy:

\[ \frac{5}{9} < \frac{a}{b} < \frac{4}{7} \]

Since `b - a = 15`, and `a > 0`, `b > 0`, the possible pairs are of the form `(a, a + 15)`. We need to check all such pairs within a reasonable range to find the one that satisfies the ratio bounds, the gcd condition, and the difference condition, and to confirm the uniqueness.

Here's the Python program that does this efficiently:

```python
import math

# Define ratio bounds
lower_bound = 5/9
upper_bound = 4/7

# Set a reasonable upper limit for 'a', for example, 100 to find all solutions
max_a = 100

for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
    b = a + 15
    if b <= 0:
        continue
    # Check gcd condition
    if math.gcd(a, b) != 1:
        continue
    ratio = a / b
    # Check ratio bounds
    if lower_bound < ratio < upper_bound:
        print(f"Candidate pair: (a={a}, b={b}), ratio={ratio:.4f}")
```

This code enumerates pairs `(a, a+15)` with `a` up to 100, filters by the gcd being 1, and checks whether the ratio lies strictly between 5/9 and 4/7. When run, it will print each candidate answer immediately, aiding in conjecture and verification.
