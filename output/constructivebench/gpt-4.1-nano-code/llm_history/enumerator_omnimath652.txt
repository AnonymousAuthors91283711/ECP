This problem involves examining the equality \(3^x \cdot 4^y = 2^{x + y} + 2^{2(x + y) - 1}\) for non-negative integers \(x, y\). To analyze solutions, we can:

1. Rewrite both sides in terms of powers of 2: note \(3^x\) remains, but \(4^y = 2^{2y}\).
2. The right side can be factored in terms of \(2^{x + y}\). 

Let's define a search space with small \(x, y\) values to find solutions, and then we can analyze the equality for solutions.

```python
# Enumerate small non-negative integers x, y within a chosen range
# to find all solutions satisfying the given equality.
# We prioritize finding exact matches and stream results immediately.

max_value = 20  # upper limit for enumeration, adjustable as needed

for x in range(max_value + 1):
    for y in range(max_value + 1):
        left = 3 ** x * 4 ** y
        exponent_sum = x + y
        right = 2 ** exponent_sum + 2 ** (2 * exponent_sum - 1)
        if left == right:
            print((x, y))
```
