This problem involves solving a coupled recurrence system for sequences \(A(k)\) and \(B(k)\) with specific initial conditions. The relations suggest that each term is the average of the neighboring terms plus the other sequence's value at the same index, leading to a system of recursive equations that can be tackled analytically or numerically.

Since the problem wants us to find \(A(4)\) given initial conditions and recurrence relations, and to do so efficiently by enumerating possible candidate values, I will implement a small search over plausible \(A(4)\) values consistent with boundary conditions, exploiting the recurrence relations.

Because actual parameters are not specified explicitly, and the relations are symmetric, a common approach is to numerically simulate all possible values up to some small bounds, check for consistency, and output candidates that satisfy the recurrence within some tolerance.

```python
# Enumerate possible A(4) candidate values based on known initial conditions 
# and the recurrence relations. Since A(k) depends on A(k-1), A(k+1), etc.,
# and B(k) depends likewise, we approximate by constructing possible sequences
# and checking for relations. Here, we use a small enumeration for A(4).

# Constraints:
# A(0)=A(1)=A(2)=0, A(3)=1
# Recurrences:
# A(k) = (A(k-1)+A(k+1)+B(k))/3
# B(k) = (B(k-1)+B(k+1)+A(k))/3

# For the computation, we will:
# 1. Fix A(4) candidates in a small range around 0 to 2.
# 2. Back-calculate B(3) using the recurrence at k=3.
# 3. Forward and backward verify consistency.

found_values = []

for A4_candidate in [i/10 for i in range(0, 21)]:  # Candidates from 0.0 to 2.0 in steps of 0.1
    A = {0:0, 1:0, 2:0, 3:1, 4:A4_candidate}
    B = {}

    # Let's try to find B(3) consistent with recurrence at k=3
    # From recurrence:
    #  A(3) = (A(2)+A(4)+B(3))/3
    # => B(3) = 3*A(3) - A(2) - A(4) = 3*1 - 0 - A(4)
    B[3] = 3*1 - A[2] - A[4]
    # Similarly, check at k=2
    #  A(2) = (A(1)+A(3)+B(2))/3
    # => B(2) = 3*A(2) - A(1) - A(3)
    B[2] = 3*0 - 0 - 1
    # Check at k=1
    #  A(1) = (A(0)+A(2)+B(1))/3
    # => B(1) = 3*A(1) - A(0) - A(2) = 0 - 0 - 0 = 0
    B[1] = 0
    # Check at k=0
    #  A(0) = (A(-1)+A(1)+B(0))/3
    # Since A(-1) is unknown, and the system is symmetric, assume A(-1)=A(1)=0 for simplicity, or skip.
    # Similarly for k=4
    #  A(4) = (A(3)+A(5)+B(4))/3
    # Without A(5) or B(4), approximate further or assume that the solution is near this candidate.
    # For simplicity, ignore further terms and verify consistency at known points only.

    # Now verify the relations at k=2,3:
    # Check A(3)'s relation:
    calc_A3 = (A[2]+A[4]+B[3])/3
    if abs(calc_A3 - A[3]) > 1e-6:
        continue  # inconsistent, discard candidate

    # Check B(3):
    calc_B3 = (B.get(2,0)+B.get(4,0)+A[3]) /3 if 4 in B else None
    # Since B(4) unknown, skip further checks

    # Collect candidate
    found_values.append(A4_candidate)
    print(A4_candidate)

# Output candidate A(4) values
```
