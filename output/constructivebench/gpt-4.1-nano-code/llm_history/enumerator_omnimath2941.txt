This problem involves finding all positive integer triplets (a, b, c) satisfying the conditions:
- a > 0, b > 0, c > 0
- 6 * a * b = c^2
- a < b < c
- c â‰¤ 35

The goal is to enumerate all such triplets and find their count, which is the set's cardinality. The solution involves iterating over reasonable ranges of a, b, c, applying the conditions, and printing matches as they are found.

Since c is bounded by 35, and a, b are positive integers, we'll keep the iteration within logical limits to improve efficiency. For each c, compute c^2, then for each a and b that satisfy 6 * a * b = c^2, check the orderings a < b < c.

```python
# Enumerate all triplets (a, b, c) with the specified conditions and print each valid triplet.
# Finally, output the total count of such triplets.

count = 0
max_c = 35
answers = []

for c in range(1, max_c + 1):
    c_squared = c * c
    # To satisfy 6 * a * b = c^2, a and b divide c^2
    for a in range(1, c + 1):  # a > 0; limit a to c for efficiency (since a < b < c)
        if c_squared % (6 * a) == 0:
            b_part = c_squared // (6 * a)
            # Now b should be > a and < c, also positive
            # Also, b is integer, so check if b_part > a and b_part < c
            b = b_part
            if b > a and b < c:
                print(f'Found triplet: (a={a}, b={b}, c={c})')
                answers.append((a, b, c))
                count += 1

print(f'Total number of solutions: {count}')
```
