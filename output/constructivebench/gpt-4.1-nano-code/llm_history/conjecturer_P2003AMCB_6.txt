  a = P2003AMCB_6_answer ∨ a = 2 * sqrt 3 / 3 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 1.1547005383792515
-1.1547005383792515
Candidate answer: 1.1547005383792515. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the candidate answer is approximately 2 * sqrt(3) / 3, which simplifies to (2√3)/3. Since the goal is to find the exact value, the closed form is just that expression.

<<<(2 * sqrt 3) / 3>>>
