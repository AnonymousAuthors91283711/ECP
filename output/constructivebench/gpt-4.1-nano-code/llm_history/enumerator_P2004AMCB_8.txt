This problem appears to involve finding the least `k` such that the sum of the first `k` odd numbers equals a certain value `n`, with `n` set to 100. 

*Mathematically*, the sum of the first `k` odd numbers is `k^2`. To verify, the sum of the first `k` odd numbers: 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k^2.

Given `n = 100`, we want to find the minimal `k` such that `k^2 = 100`, i.e., `k = 10`.

Because the problem states to enumerate possible answers, for the code, we'll iterate `k` from 0 up to some maximum (say, 20, covering all square roots around 100).

We'll print candidates `k` when their sum of first `k` odd numbers is `â‰¤ n`.

```python
# Enumerate k from 0 up to 20 to find all k where sum of first k odd numbers
# equals n (100) or less, and identify the least such k
max_k = 20
target_n = 100
for k in range(max_k + 1):
    sum_k = sum(2 * i + 1 for i in range(k))
    # Check if sum equals target
    if sum_k == target_n:
        print(k)
```
