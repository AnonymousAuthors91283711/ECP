The problem involves the probabilities of certain binomial events for \(n=5\) with parameter \(p\) where \(0 < p < 1\). The key is to analyze the probabilities \(P_1\), \(P_2\), \(P_3\), then find the relationship among them, particularly the maximum probability when \(p\) varies.

Since \(P_k = \binom{5}{k} p^k (1-p)^{5-k}\):

- \(\binom{5}{1} = 5\)
- \(\binom{5}{2} = 10\)
- \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

The program will:
1. Explore \(p\) in small increments for efficiency.
2. Calculate \(P_1, P_2, P_3\).
3. Check when \(P_1 = P_2\).
4. Find the maximum of \(P_3\).

Because the probabilities are symmetric around \(p=0.5\), the maximum of \(P_3\) occurs at \(p=\frac{3}{5}\) or \(p=\frac{2}{5}\). But to adhere to the coding requirements, we will compute across a small range and identify candidates.

```python
import math

# Binomial coefficient function for small n
def choose(n, k):
    return math.comb(n, k)

# Parameters
n = 5
p_values = [i/100 for i in range(1, 100)]  # p in (0,1), step=0.01

max_P3 = 0
candidate_p_for_max_P3 = None
solutions = []

for p in p_values:
    P1 = choose(5,1) * p**1 * (1 - p)**4
    P2 = choose(5,2) * p**2 * (1 - p)**3
    P3 = choose(5,3) * p**3 * (1 - p)**2
    # Record maximum P3
    if P3 > max_P3:
        max_P3 = P3
        candidate_p_for_max_P3 = p
        print(f"New max P3: {P3:.6f} at p={p:.2f}")
    # Check when P1 ≈ P2 (allow small numeric tolerance)
    if abs(P1 - P2) < 1e-4:
        solutions.append((p, P1, P2, P3))
        print(f"P1 ≈ P2 at p={p:.2f}: P1={P1:.6f}, P2={P2:.6f}, P3={P3:.6f}")

# Output the maximum P3 found
print(f"Maximum P3 ≈ {max_P3:.6f} at p={candidate_p_for_max_P3:.2f}")

# Return a representative answer as the ratio P1 = P2 condition seems to occur near p=0.4 or 0.6
# Depending on precision, these are closely around p=0.39 and 0.61

# This script identifies where P1 ≈ P2 and the maximum P3 in range
