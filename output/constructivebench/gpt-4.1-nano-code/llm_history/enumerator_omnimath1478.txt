The problem involves characterizing functions \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) that are strictly monotonic and can be written as \(f + g = 2x\) where \(g\) is involutive (\(g(g(x))=x\)). To enumerate solutions, we analyze the conditions and identify candidates.

- From \(f + g = 2x\), we get \(f(x) = 2x - g(x)\).
- Since \(g\) is involutive, \(g(g(x)) = x\).
- For \(g\), possible involutions include \(g(x) = x\) (identity), or some other functions satisfying \(g(g(x)) = x\), such as \(g(x) = -x + c\) for some constant \(c\).

Between these, the simplest dominates, especially since \(f\) must be strictly monotonic, which constrains the form of \(g\).

We'll instantiate \(g(x)=x\) and \(g(x)=-x + c\) for small \(c\), compute \(f\), check monotonicity, and print solutions.

```python
# Enumerate possible involutive functions g
possible_gs = [
    lambda x: x,                          # g(x) = x, involutive
    lambda x, c=0: -x + c                # g(x) = -x + c, g(g(x))=x, involutive
]

# Set thresholds for constants c
c_values = [-1, 0, 1]

# Store solutions
solutions = []

# Enumerate solutions based on selected g
for g in possible_gs:
    for c in c_values:
        # define g for current c
        def g_func(x, c=c):
            return g(x, c)
        # define f based on g
        def f(x):
            return 2*x - g_func(x)
        # Check if f is strictly increasing over a reasonable interval
        # Sample points to test monotonicity
        xs = [-10, -5, 0, 5, 10]
        f_vals = [f(x) for x in xs]
        # Check if f is monotonic
        increasing = all(f_vals[i] < f_vals[i+1] for i in range(len(f_vals)-1))
        if increasing:
            # Print and store the function definition
            print(f"g(x) = {g.__name__} with c={c}")
            print(f"f(x) = {f}")
            solutions.append(f)

# Note: This enumeration covers simple involutions and selected constants.

The given program attempts to enumerate functions \(g\) and derive corresponding functions \(f\) that satisfy the given conditions, focusing on involutive \(g\). However, it encounters several issues:

1. **Inability to generate meaningful involutive functions:**  
   The code only considers \(g(x) = x\) and \(g(x) = -x + c\). While these are involutions, it doesn't explore more general or complex involutions, but for the problem scope, it's acceptable.

2. **Incorrect function comparisons:**  
   The code tests for monotonicity by sampling points, which is standard practice. The problem asks for strict monotonicity, and the checks are aligned with that.

3. **Output handling is missing for the main theorem:**  
   The code aims to generate solutions but never actually tests whether the generated \(f\) and \(g\) satisfy the primary theoretical conditions, such as involutive \(g\) and the relation \(f + g = 2x\).

4. **No explicit check that \(f + g = 2x\):**  
   These key conditions for the problem are not verified in the code. Without verifying the core conditions, the solutions are not validated.

5. **No actual enumeration of answers within parameters bounds:**  
   The enumeration only tries simple \(g\), but the core theorem involves more subtle functions, possibly more complex involutions.

6. **No attempt to print the functions in exact form or check if the theorem holds.**

**Conclusion:**  
The code's output was empty because it doesn't actually verify the core conditions of the problem, nor does it output valid solutions that satisfy the conditions of the theorem. It just prints some examples without validation.

**Acceptance Judgment:**  
This code does **not** produce answers satisfying the problem conditions, so it should be rejected.

**Corrected Approach (Summary):**  
- Focus on the fundamental condition \(f + g = 2x\).  
- For involutive \(g\), the only solutions are of a certain form (e.g., \(g(x) = x\) or \(g(x) = -x\)).  
- For each involutive \(g\), define \(f(x) = 2x - g(x)\).  
- Check whether \(f\) is strictly monotone.  
- Output each \(f\) explicitly when it satisfies the monotonicity condition.

The problem appears to be a formal mathematical statement involving properties like strict monotonicity, involutive functions, and a certain functional equation. The provided program is empty, which cannot produce any answers, so it fails to meet the problem's requirements.

Given the problem's structure, likely we're to find all functions \(f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) that are strictly increasing (StrictMono), can be written as \(f + g = 2x\), with an involutive \(g\) (\(g(g(x))=x\)). The key constraints are the involutive function \(g\) and the equation involving \(f + g\).

Based on the properties:

- \(f + g = 2x\)
- \(g\) involutive: \(g(g(x)) = x\)
- \(f\) is strictly increasing.

From \(f + g = 2x\), we get \(f = 2x - g\).

Since \(f\) is strictly increasing, and \(g\) is involutive and appears in the formula, it is natural to hypothesize that \(g\) could be an involutive, increasing or decreasing function. For the class of involutive functions, classic candidates are \(g(x) = x\) (identity, involutive), or \(g(x) = a - x\), which is involutive and affine.

Let's test \(g(x) = x\):

- \(g(g(x))=x\), OK
- \(f = 2x - g(x) = 2x - x = x\), which is strictly increasing, OK
- check if \(f + g = 2x\): \(x + x = 2x\), OK
- \(f = x\), which is strictly increasing.

Similarly, \(g(x) = a - x\):

- \(g(g(x)) = a - (a - x) = x\), OK
- \(f = 2x - g(x) = 2x - (a - x) = 3x - a\)
- For \(f\) to be strictly increasing, \(f'(x)=3>0\), OK
- \(f + g = 3x - a + a - x = 2x\), OK

In particular, when \(a\) is any real number,
