The problem appears to be related to solving for a value `k` within certain constraints involving given numbers and an equation. The key steps involve:

- Calculating the total sum `total = 4 + 5 + 7 = 16`.
- Defining `new_total = total - k`.
- Checking an equation: `2 * (4 / total) = 4 / new_total`.
- Ensuring `new_total > 0`.
- Finding all `k` satisfying these conditions.

Since the only relevant `k` must make the equation true, we can solve for `k` directly from the equation and then check the domain constraints.

Let's implement a small enumeration for `k` within a reasonable range around the total, for example, from 1 to 15, to find such `k`.

```python
# Enumerate k values to find satisfying solutions based on the given conditions
total = 4 + 5 + 7  # total sum
results = []

for k in range(1, total):  # k must be less than total to keep new_total > 0
    new_total = total - k
    # Check the equation: 2 * (4 / total) == 4 / new_total
    # To avoid floating point issues, cross-multiplied form:
    # 2 * 4 * new_total == 4 * total
    if 2 * 4 * new_total == 4 * total:
        print(k)
```
