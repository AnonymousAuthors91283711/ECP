This problem involves analyzing a specific constructed set \( C \) within a finite universe, and then counting the number of its independent subset families (collections of disjoint subsets). To enumerate possible answers, I will generate the structure, create the sets explicitly, and then brute-force over all independent families up to a small size or limited subsets. Since the exact value is unknown (represented by `sorry`), I will focus on systematically enumerating all independent families and count them precisely â€” this can help conjecture or check the answer.

Given the problem's complexity, I will:
- Explicitly generate all elements \( a(i) \) and \( b(i) \),
- Construct the set \( C \) by enumerating the unions,
- Generate all subsets \( S \subseteq C \),
- Filter those that are pairwise disjoint (independent),
- Count such \( S \).

Because the total may be very large, I will limit enumeration to small subset sizes or early break conditions, but I will output each answer attempt immediately.

```python
# Python code to enumerate possible counts of independent families of subsets from constructed sets

def main():
    # Generate sets A, a(i), b(i)
    A = [(2*i, ) for i in range(10)]
    a_list = [ (2*i, ) for i in range(10)]
    b_list = [ (2*i + 1, ) for i in range(10)]

    # Generate C components
    # First component: singleton sets {a(i), b(i)}
    C1 = [{a, b} for a, b in zip(a_list, b_list)]
    # Second component: pairs {a(i), a(i+1)} for i in 0..8
    C2 = [{a_list[i], a_list[i+1]} for i in range(9)]
    # Third component: pairs {b(i), b(i+1)} for i in 0..8
    C3 = [{b_list[i], b_list[i+1]} for i in range(9)]

    # Full set C
    C = C1 + C2 + C3

    # For enumeration efficiency, convert to list of frozensets for hashing
    sets = [frozenset(s) for s in C]

    count = 0
    total_subsets = 1 << len(sets)  # 2^|C|

    # Enumerate all subsets S of C
    for mask in range(total_subsets):
        S = [sets[i] for i in range(len(sets)) if (mask & (1 << i))]
        # Check if all sets in S are pairwise disjoint
        union_all = set()
        valid = True
        for s in S:
            if union_all & s:
                valid = False
                break
            union_all |= s
        if valid:
            count += 1
            # Output each valid family (could be huge, so limit or comment out)
            # print(f"Valid family: {S}")
    print(f"Total independent families: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
