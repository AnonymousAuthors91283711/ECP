  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (∏ k in Finset.range n, (k : ℝ)/(k + 1)) < (1 : ℝ)/2010} P2010AMCA_19_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 2011, product = 0.0004972650422675301
Least n where product < 1/2010: 2011. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<2011>>>
"Based on the enumeration and pattern, the smallest n where the product is less than 1/2010 is n = 2011."
