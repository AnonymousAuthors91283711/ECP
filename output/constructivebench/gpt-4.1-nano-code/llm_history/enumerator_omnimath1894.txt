The given problem appears to be a functional equation over the real numbers, asking us to find all functions `f : ℝ → ℝ` satisfying
\[f (x^2 + f y) = f (f x) + f (y^2) + 2 f (x y)\]
for all real `x, y`. 

Since the problem is high-school level but complex, I'll focus on examining specific inputs to derive potential solutions. I'll implement a search for potential solutions by testing simple functions like constants and identities over small sample points, then printing all candidates that satisfy the equation at those points.

The code will:
- Fix small sample inputs
- Test candidate functions, e.g., constant functions or linear functions
- Print candidate functions that satisfy the functional equation at the sample points

This approach can help in conjecturing the solution forms, especially when the space of functions is large.

```python
import math

# Define candidate functions to test: constants and linear
def constant_c(c):
    return lambda x: c

def linear_a_b(a, b):
    return lambda x: a * x + b

# Testing options
candidates = [
    constant_c(0),
    constant_c(1),
    constant_c(-1),
    linear_a_b(1, 0),
    linear_a_b(0, 1),
    linear_a_b(-1, 1)
]

# Sample points to test the functional equation
sample_points = [
    (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1),
    (1, 1), (-1, 1), (0.5, 2),
    (-2, -3)
]

# Function to check if candidate satisfies the equation at sample points
def check_function(f):
    for x, y in sample_points:
        # Handle potential domain issues with math
        try:
            left = f(x**2 + f(y))
            right = f(f(x)) + f(y**2) + 2 * f(x*y)
            # Use a tolerance for floating point comparisons
            if abs(left - right) > 1e-8:
                return False
        except:
            return False
    return True

# Enumerate and print candidates satisfying the functional equation
print("Potential solutions tested over sample points:")
for idx, f_candidate in enumerate(candidates):
    if check_function(f_candidate):
        print(f"Candidate {idx + 1}: {f_candidate(0):.2f}x + {f_candidate(0):.2f} (linear) or constant")
        # To identify exact functions, print their form
        # For simplicity, we record candidate type based on known functions
        # In practice, more sophisticated guesses can be added
```

This script tests simple functions at multiple sample points, printing all that satisfy the functional equation on those points, aiding in forming hypotheses about the entire solution set.
