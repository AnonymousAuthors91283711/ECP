  omnimath2087_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found c=7 with a=210, b=216
Conditions: 42|210, 72|216, 210≠216≠7
Sum inequalities: 210+216>7, 210+7>216, 216+7>210. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The minimal c satisfying the conditions appears to be c=7, with a and b divisible by 42 and 72 respectively, and inequalities holding. Given the divisibility constraints, the minimal a and b are 210 (=42*5) and 216 (=72*3). The sum inequalities hold. Generalizing from the minimal example, the smallest c is the GCD of the minimal multiples plus 1, which is 7.
