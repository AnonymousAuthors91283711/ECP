theorem omnimath3374 : 
  {l : List ℚ | l.sum = (1 : ℚ)/4 ∧ ∀ x ∈ l, ∃ n : ℕ, x = (1 : ℚ)/n ∧ 1 ≤ n} = omnimath3374_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: [0.25]
[0.125, 0.125]. Expected Answer Type: Set (List ℚ)
The answer set consists of lists whose elements are reciprocals of integers ≥ 1, summing to 1/4. The options are either a single term 1/4 (reciprocal of 4), or two terms 1/8 + 1/8 (reciprocal of 8 + reciprocal of 8). The pattern suggests sums of such reciprocals produce 1/4 only for these combinations. Final form.
