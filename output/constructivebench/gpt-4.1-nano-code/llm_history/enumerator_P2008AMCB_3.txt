The problem involves finding the maximum possible value of `s`, where `s` is the value of `team p` for some student `p`. Given the constraints: each `team p` is at least 15000, sum of all `team p` (for 21 students) is at most 700000, and we want the greatest `s` that still admits a valid distribution of `team p` values.

To find the greatest such `s`, note:
- Maximum `s` occurs when one `team p` takes as much as possible, and the rest are at their minimum.
- Minimum for each other student is 15000.
- For `p`, to maximize `team p`, set all other 20 students to 15000.

We can check what value of `team p` can be, and verify if the total sum remains within 700000:

`team p + 20 * 15000 ≤ 700000`

`team p ≤ 700000 - 20 * 15000 = 700000 - 300000 = 400000`

But since `team p` can be at least 15000, we can pick the maximum possible value `team p = 400000`. This is within the constraints, and the rest are at their minimums.

Here's a simple enumeration that confirms that the maximum `s` can be 400000, and such a distribution exists:

```python
# Enumerate possible maximum scores for team p
max_s_candidate = 400000

# Verify that for s=400000, the rest can be at minimum
rest_total = 20 * 15000  # total for other students
total = max_s_candidate + rest_total
if total <= 700000:
    print("Maximum team p score:", max_s_candidate)
else:
    print("No distribution possible with s =", max_s_candidate)

# Check one step down to ensure the maximum is correct
s_down = max_s_candidate - 1
total_down = s_down + 20*15000
if total_down <= 700000:
    print("Also possible with s =", s_down)
```

This code confirms the maximum `s` and demonstrates the distribution's feasibility.

```python
# Enumerate to find the greatest s satisfying the constraints
min_score = 15000
max_total = 700000
num_students = 21
remaining_sum = max_total - (num_students - 1) * min_score

# The maximum score s for some student p, when others are at minimum
max_s = remaining_sum  # Because the sum of other students at minimum is (20*15000)
print("Maximum team p score:", max_s)
```
