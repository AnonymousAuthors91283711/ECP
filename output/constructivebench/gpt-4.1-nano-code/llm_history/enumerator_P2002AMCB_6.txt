The problem involves analyzing the roots of the quadratic polynomial \( X^2 + aX + b \) at points \( a \) and \( b \), with the conditions \( a \neq 0 \), \( b \neq 0 \). The statement asserts the equivalence between the evaluation of the polynomial at these points being zero and some property of the pair \((a, b)\).

To assist in formulating the set \( P2002AMCB_6_answer \), we'll generate candidate pairs \((a, b)\) with small integer values respecting \(a \neq 0\), \(b \neq 0\). For each candidate, we'll check if both evaluations \( P(a) \) and \( P(b) \) are zero, indicating they are roots of the quadratic polynomial.

The key is to test small values systematically and output pairs where both evaluations yield zero (exact solutions). We'll limit ourselves to small integers \(\{-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3\}\), prioritize exact checks, and immediately print qualifying pairs.

```python
# Enumerate small integer pairs (a, b) with a != 0, b != 0
# For each pair, check if both evaluate to zero at points a and b
result_pairs = []

# Define a small set of candidates for a and b
candidates = [-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3]

for a in candidates:
    if a == 0:
        continue
    for b in candidates:
        if b == 0:
            continue
        # Evaluate polynomial at a and b
        val_at_a = a**2 + a * a + b
        val_at_b = b**2 + a * b + b
        # Check if both evaluations are zero
        if val_at_a == 0 and val_at_b == 0:
            pair = (a, b)
            print(f"Candidate pair: {pair}")
            result_pairs.append(pair)
```
