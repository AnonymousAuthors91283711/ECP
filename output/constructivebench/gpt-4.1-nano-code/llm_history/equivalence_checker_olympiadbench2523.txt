Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: { (0, 0), (0, 1.25), (0.5, 0), (-0.5, 0), (-1.0, 1.5), (1.5, 4.0) }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer lists several points that satisfy the given system of equations, but it's not a complete solution. The system describes all pairs (x,y) where either x=0 or (1/2 + y - 2x²)=0, and either y=0 or (5/2 + x - y)=0. The proposed answer correctly identifies some solutions but misses others (like any point where x=0 and y=0, which is already included as (0,0), but might miss other combinations). The answer is mostly correct but incomplete, hence "Close".
