[write_program]
Let's analyze the problem and write a Python program to explore the possible values of N satisfying the given conditions: for the minimal N, any 2016-element subset s of [1, N], with s ⊆ [1, N], has a 2016-element subset t within [1, N], disjoint from s, with sum t = N.

This resembles a combinatorial number theory problem related to subset sums and minimal bounds.

Approach:
- We choose small N values to check the condition.
- For each N, generate all 2016-sized subsets s ⊆ [1, N] (only feasible for small N).
- For each s, check if there's a 2016-element subset t disjoint from s in [1, N] summing to N.
- Find the minimal N for which this property holds for all such s.

Since enumerating all subsets with large N is infeasible, we focus on small N, increasing stepwise, and break when the condition fails.

```python
import itertools

# Function to check the property for a given N
def check_property(N, subset_size=2016):
    # Generate all subsets s of size subset_size within [1, N]
    # To limit computational cost, only test for small N
    numbers = list(range(1, N + 1))
    if len(numbers) < subset_size:
        return True  # No s possible if N < subset_size
    
    for s in itertools.combinations(numbers, subset_size):
        s_set = set(s)
        remaining = [x for x in numbers if x not in s_set]
        # Now check if there's a subset t of size subset_size with sum N and t ⊆ remaining
        # To reduce complexity, attempt to find such t greedily
        # Since sum t must be N, try to pick largest available numbers
        
        # Generate all subsets of size subset_size in remaining to check sum
        for t in itertools.combinations(remaining, subset_size):
            if sum(t) == N:
                break
        else:
            # No such t found for this s, property fails
            return False
    return True

# Search for minimal N starting from a small value
# Since subset_size=2016, minimal N must be at least 2016
N_candidate = 2016
max_N = 3000  # limit for search

for N in range(N_candidate, max_N + 1):
    print(f"Checking N={N}")
    if check_property(N):
        print(f"Minimal N satisfying the property: {N}")
        break
```
