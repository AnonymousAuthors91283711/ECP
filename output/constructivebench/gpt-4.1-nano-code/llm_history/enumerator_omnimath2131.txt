The problem seems to involve finding a real number \( x \) such that, after iterating a specific function \( n=2017 \) times starting from 0, the result is 1. The iteration function is \( y \mapsto |y| + x \). We need to analyze the iterative process to determine possible \( x \) values that satisfy this condition.

Specifically, the iteration is:
\[ y_{k+1} = |y_k| + x \]
from \( y_0=0 \), over \( n=2017 \) steps to give:
\[ y_{2017} = 1 \].

Given the absolute value operation, the sequence depends on whether \( y_k \) is non-negative or negative at each step. The key insight: for large \( n \), the behavior stabilizes, and the only fixed points can be derived from the recurrence relations considering when \( y_k \) turns non-negative or stays negative.

To find all solutions, we simulate the iteration for multiple small samples and analyze the pattern to conjecture the possible \( x \).

```python
# Program to find all x such that iterating y => |y| + x starting from y=0
# for n=2017 steps results in y=1.

# We analyze the iteration behavior:
# Since initial y=0, the first iterates:
# y1 = |0| + x = x
# y2 = |x| + x
# y3 = | y2 | + x, and so on, for 2017 iterations.

# We know that after 2017 steps, the result should be 1:
# y_2017 = 1

# To handle the absolute value, consider possible sign patterns:

# We test small sample x values to see what solutions produce y_2017=1.

# Since the iteration depends on absolute value, for each candidate x,
# simulate the process and check if the result equals 1 at step 2017.

# Limit the search space for x to -3 to 3 for computational feasibility.

answers = set()

for x in [i*0.001 for i in range(-3000, 3001)]:
    y = 0
    for _ in range(2017):
        y = abs(y) + x
    if abs(y - 1) < 1e-7:
        answers.add(round(x, 4))
        print(f"x ≈ {round(x, 4)} yields y_{2017} ≈ {y}")

# Output the candidate solutions found, formatted for clarity.
print("Candidate x values approximately satisfying the condition:")
for x in sorted(answers):
    print(x)
