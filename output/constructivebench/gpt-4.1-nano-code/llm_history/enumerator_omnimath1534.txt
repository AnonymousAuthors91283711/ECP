The problem involves logarithmic expressions with different bases and their relationships. To analyze and find potential solutions for `x > 1` satisfying the given equation:
\[ \log_2 (\log_4 x) + \log_4 (\log_{16} x) + \log_{16} (\log_2 x) = 0 \]

We can try small sample values of \(x > 1\) with simple structure, such as powers of 2, 4, and 16, and evaluate the expressions to look for solutions or pattern hints.

Here's a Python program that:
- Uses specific sample points (powers of 2, 4, and 16)
- Computes the value of the LHS for each
- Prints when the value approaches zero, either exactly or approximately
- Continues up to a reasonable range of \(x\)

This supports conjecture and rough estimation for the true solution.

```python
import math

# Define the functions to evaluate the components
def log_base(a, x):
    return math.log(x) / math.log(a)

# Candidate x values (powers of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128)
candidate_exponents = range(1, 11)
for e in candidate_exponents:
    for base in [2, 4, 16]:
        x = base ** e
        if x <= 1:
            continue  # only consider x > 1
        try:
            val1 = log_base(2, log_base(4, x))
            val2 = log_base(4, log_base(16, x))
            val3 = log_base(16, log_base(2, x))
            total = val1 + val2 + val3
            print(f"x = {x} (base {base}^{e}): sum = {total}")
        except ValueError:
            # log domain error if log is not valid
            continue
```
