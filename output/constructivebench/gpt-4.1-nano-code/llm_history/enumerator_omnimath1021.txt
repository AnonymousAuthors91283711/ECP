The given code appears to involve set cardinalities over functions from ℤ×ℤ to Fin 2, with certain symmetry and relation constraints. Since the problem involves complex set properties related to functions satisfying specific equations, a straightforward enumeration approach in Python is to consider small finite approximations instead of infinite ℤ×ℤ.

For an illustrative approach, select small ranges of (a, b), say from -2 to 1, and enumerate all possible functions c: obtained by assigning values (0 or 1) to each point in the small grid, then filter those satisfying the given relations (which correspond to certain symmetries). Count such functions and look for the number of possible solutions.

Here's how we might do that in Python, focusing on small grid points for feasibility:

```python
# Enumerate small grid of points: a, b in [-2, 1]
points = [(a, b) for a in range(-2, 2) for b in range(-2, 2)]
total_points = len(points)

# Generate all possible functions c: points -> {0,1}
for mask in range(2 ** total_points):
    c_values = {}
    for i, p in enumerate(points):
        c_values[p] = (mask >> i) & 1

    def c(a, b):
        return c_values.get((a, b), 0)

    # Check the relations:
    # c (a,b) = c (-1 - b, a + 1)
    # c (a,b) = c (1 - b, a - 1)
    valid = True
    for (a, b) in points:
        if c(a, b) != c(-1 - b, a + 1) or c(a, b) != c(1 - b, a - 1):
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        print(f"Valid function with c-values: {c_values}")
        # Count or store as needed
```
