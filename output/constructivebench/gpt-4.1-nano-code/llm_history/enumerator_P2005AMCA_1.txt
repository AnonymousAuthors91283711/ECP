The problem involves solving a system of equations based on the given conditions:

- \( 2 = 0.1 \times x \)
- \( 2 = 0.2 \times y \)

From these, we can directly find \(x\) and \(y\):

- \( x = 2 / 0.1 = 20 \)
- \( y = 2 / 0.2 = 10 \)

Then, compute \( x - y = 20 - 10 = 10 \).

Because the problem wants to find the value of \( x - y \), and the given conditions clearly give us these values directly, the answer is 10. To match the code style, we can write a small enumerator that confirms and prints this answer.

```python
# This script derives the values of x and y from the given equations
# and computes their difference, printing the result immediately.

# Given equations:
# 2 = 0.1 * x  => x = 2 / 0.1
# 2 = 0.2 * y  => y = 2 / 0.2

# Compute x and y
x = 2 / 0.1
print(f"x = {x}")  # Should print x = 20.0
y = 2 / 0.2
print(f"y = {y}")  # Should print y = 10.0

# Compute x - y
difference = x - y
print(f"x - y = {difference}")  # Should print 10.0
```
