Ground Truth Answer: fun x y z => y + z
Proposed Answer: fun x y z => 0.3 + 1.2 * z - 0.4 * y + 0.2 * x
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem states that for x ∈ (0,1), y ∈ (-1,0), z ∈ (1,2), we need to show some expression is positive.

2. Ground truth answer is y + z. Since y > -1 and z > 1, y + z > -1 + 1 = 0, satisfying the condition.

3. Proposed answer is a more complex expression: 0.3 + 1.2z - 0.4y + 0.2x

Let's evaluate the proposed answer's behavior:
- Minimum occurs at x→0, y→0, z→1: 0.3 + 1.2(1) - 0.4(0) + 0.2(0) = 1.5 > 0
- Maximum occurs at x→1, y→-1, z→2: 0.3 + 1.2(2) - 0.4(-1) + 0.2(1) = 0.3 + 2.4 + 0.4 + 0.2 = 3.3 > 0

While the proposed answer does satisfy the positivity condition, it's not equivalent to the ground truth answer y + z. The expressions are fundamentally different, even though both satisfy the problem's requirements.
