The problem defines a function \(f : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) with specific properties: starting from \((0,0)\) with \(f(0,0)=0\), and for each \((a,b)\), the set \(\{f(a,b), f(a,b+1), f(a+1,b)\}\) is always consecutive integers \(\{m, m+1, m+2\}\) for some \(m\). The goal is to find the set of all possible values \(f(x,y)\) can take, for each \((x,y)\).

Because the constraints specify the function's initial value and that for each grid point, the neighboring values form a specific set of three consecutive integers, we can analyze small \((x,y)\) pairs, generate all ways this can happen, and collect all possible \(f(x,y)\) values.

Here's the Python code to systematically enumerate possible functions satisfying the constraints for small \(x,y\), exploring all valid options for the local sets, and collecting the possible values at given coordinates:

```python
# Enumerate possible values for f(x,y) given constraints:
# 1. Start from (0,0) with f(0,0)=0.
# 2. For each point, the neighboring values form a set of 3 consecutive integers.
# 3. Recursively build possible values to fill the grid up to (max_x, max_y).

def enumerate_values(max_x, max_y):
    from collections import defaultdict

    # Store possible values for each (x,y): a set of possible f(x,y).
    possibilities = defaultdict(set)
    # Initialize starting point
    possibilities[(0,0)] = {0}

    # Generate all possible functions by propagating constraints
    def propagate():
        updated = True
        while updated:
            updated = False
            for x in range(max_x+1):
                for y in range(max_y+1):
                    current_vals = possibilities[(x,y)]
                    new_vals = set()
                    for val in current_vals:
                        # Propagate to neighbors
                        for dx, dy in [(1,0),(0,1)]:
                            nx, ny = x+dx, y+dy
                            if 0 <= nx <= max_x and 0 <= ny <= max_y:
                                # For neighbor, possible set is {m, m+1, m+2} for some m
                                # Neighbor's value is in {val-2, val-1, val}
                                neighbor_possibles = {val-2, val-1, val}
                                if possibilities[(nx, ny)]:
                                    # Intersection with existing possibilities
                                    new_set = possibilities[(nx, ny)] & neighbor_possibles
                                else:
                                    new_set = neighbor_possibles
                                if new_set - possibilities[(nx, ny)]:
                                    possibilities[(nx, ny)] |= new_set
                                    updated = True
    # Repeat until no more updates
    for _ in range(max_x+max_y+10):  # enough iterations for convergence
        propagate()

    # Collect all possible values at each position
    result = {}
    for x in range(max_x+1):
        for y in range(max_y+1):
            # Consider all possibilities at each step
            result[(x,y)] = sorted(possibilities[(x,y)])
    return result

# Choose small max_x, max_y for enumeration
max_x, max_y = 2, 2
vals = enumerate_values(max_x, max_y)

# Print the possible values at each coordinate
for y in range(max_y+1):
    for x in range(max_x+1):
        print(f"Possible values at ({x},{y}): {vals[(x,y)]}")
```
