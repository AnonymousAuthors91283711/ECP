This problem appears to involve a function `f(n)` depending on a parameter `T`, where `k = 21 + 2 * T`, and we seek the greatest `n` such that `f(n) = 2n^2 - k n + 77` is positive and prime.

Since the question involves finding the greatest `n` satisfying certain conditions for given `T`, and the task is to enumerate potential answers and conjectures, we will:

- Fix some small value for `T`, for instance `T=0`, to keep the search manageable.
- Use a brute-force approach over `n` in a reasonable range.
- For each `n`, check if `f(n)` > 0 and prime.
- Track the maximum `n` satisfying that.
- Print each qualifying `n` as soon as found.

This approach maximizes efficiency by limiting the range and stopping early when possible.

```python
import sympy

def is_prime(n):
    return sympy.isprime(n)

def enumerate_answers(T, max_n=100):
    k = 21 + 2 * T
    for n in range(max_n):
        f_n = 2 * n**2 - k * n + 77
        if f_n > 0 and is_prime(f_n):
            print(n)
            yield n

T_sample = 0
max_n = 100  # Search range for n
print(f"Parameters: T = {T_sample}")
answers = list(enumerate_answers(T_sample, max_n))
if answers:
    print("Greatest answer:", answers[-1])
else:
    print("No answers found within range.")
```
