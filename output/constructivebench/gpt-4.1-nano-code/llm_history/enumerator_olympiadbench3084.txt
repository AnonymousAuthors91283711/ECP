The problem involves defining a function \(f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{N}\) satisfying a recurrence relation \(f(n) = f(n-1) \times f(n-2)\), positivity for positive \(n\), and certain relations between \(f(1)\), \(f(2)\), and their ratio. The goal is to find \(f(f(4))\), but the exact value isn't explicitly given—it depends on the recursive structure and the parameters.

Given these relations, the key constraints are:
- \(f(n) = f(n-1) \times f(n-2)\)
- \(f(1) = \frac{f(2)}{512}\) (positively, so \(f(2)\) divisible by 512)
- \(\frac{1}{f(1)} = 2 \times f(2)\), which simplifies to \(f(1) \times 2 \times f(2) = 1\)

From that, since \(f(1) = \frac{f(2)}{512}\), substituting into the second gives:
\[
\frac{f(2)}{512} \times 2f(2) = 1 \implies \frac{2f(2)^2}{512} = 1 \implies 2f(2)^2 = 512 \implies f(2)^2 = 256
\]
and since \(f(2) > 0\):
\[
f(2) = 16
\]
then
\[
f(1) = \frac{16}{512} = \frac{1}{32}
\]
but \(f(n): \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{N}\), so \(f(1)\) must be a natural number, contradicting \(\frac{1}{32}\). However, because the question appears to be abstract and involves ℕ to relate to the recurrence, perhaps the relations involve rational extensions or we interpret \(f(1)\) as rational temporarily.

Since the code structure suggests enumeration, here's a code snippet that attempts to find \(f(4)\) via small candidate values consistent with the constraints.

---

```python
# Enumerate possible values of f(2) that are multiples of 512 and produce consistent values
# Based on the relations derived, f(2) likely should be 16, but given the possible contradiction, 
# we're exploring small candidates for f(2) that satisfy the key relations.

# According to the derivation, for f(1) to be integer, f(2) must be multiple of 512, but that conflicts with earlier rational derivation,
# so we consider small integer candidates for f(2) to observe recurrence pattern.

# To satisfy f(1) = f(2)/512, f(2) must be divisible by 512, so start from 512 upwards.
# For simplicity, we'll check small multiples of 512 up to 2^10.

# We assume f(n) to be positive integers that meet the recurrence.

# The key relation 1 / f(1) = 2 * f(2) simplifies, so we search for small f(2) and f(1).

# Since f(1) = f(2)/512, and both must be positive integers, f(2) must be divisible by 512.

# Our approach: enumerate small f(2), compute f(1), check positivity, then generate f(3), f(4).

# For demonstration, focus on f(2)=512, f(1)=1, then check the recurrence.

# Generate sequence:
# f(n) = f(n-1)*f(n-2). Starting with f(1)=1, f(2)=512

def generate_sequence(f1, f2, length=10):
    seq = [f1, f2]
    for _ in range(2, length):
        next_val = seq[-1] * seq[-2]
        seq.append(next_val)
    return seq

# Begin enumeration
for f2_candidate in range(512, 1024, 512):
    f1_candidate = f2_candidate // 512
    if f1_candidate * 512 != f2_candidate:
        continue  # skip if not divisible
    seq = generate_sequence(f1_candidate, f2_candidate)
    # Output f(4)
    print(f"f(1)={f1_candidate}, f(2)={f2_candidate}, sequence={seq}")
    print(f"f(4) = {seq[3]}")
```
