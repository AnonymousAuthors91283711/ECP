This problem involves a recursive sequence \(a(n)\) with initial conditions, a recurrence relation for \(n > 2\), and an infinite sum component starting from \(a(4)\). The goal appears to be to evaluate the nested radical expression involving \(a(1), a(2), a(3)\), and the infinite sum of subsequent \(a(n)\).

For assistant purposes, I will focus on enumerating possible candidate values of the sum \( \sum_{n=4}^\infty a(n) \) based on the recurrence and initial values, to conjecture about the limit of the sequence or the sum.

Given the initial:
- \(a(1) = 8\)
- \(a(2) = 64\)
- \(a(3) = 1024\)

And the recurrence:
\[ a(n+1) a(n-1)^5 = a(n)^4 a(n-2)^2 \quad \text{for } n > 2 \]

Let's choose small sample values for \(a(n)\) beyond the initial conditions, assuming the sequence approaches a limit or pattern.

Because the sequence is complicated, and to help with the conjecture, I'll try to generate possible later values \(a(4)\), \(a(5)\), and so on, based on the recurrence. Given the pattern of initial terms:
- The sequence seems to grow rapidly: 8, 64, 1024

Assuming potential linear or exponential growth, let's proceed to estimate the sum of \(a(n)\) from \(n=4\) until the sum stabilizes or exceeds a certain threshold.

Since the summation involves infinitely many terms, an approximation approach is suitable: generate the first few \(a(n)\), sum them, and observe stabilization.

```python
# Enumerate candidate values for a(n) for n >= 4 using the recurrence relation
# given initial conditions and observe the partial sum of the sequence.

# Initial known values
a1 = 8
a2 = 64
a3 = 1024

# We know the recurrence for n > 2:
# a(n+1) * a(n-1)^5 = a(n)^4 * a(n-2)^2
# Rearranged:
# a(n+1) = (a(n)^4 * a(n-2)^2) / (a(n-1)^5)

# We will generate next terms up to n=10 (for a total of 7 terms from a4 to a10)

a = [None, a1, a2, a3]  # Indexing from 1 for convenience

# Generate subsequent terms
max_terms = 10
for n in range(3, max_terms):
    numerator = a[n]^4 * a[n-2]^2
    denominator = a[n-1]^5
    # To avoid division by zero and ensure positive terms, check
    if denominator == 0:
        break
    a_next = numerator / denominator
    print(f"a({n+1}) = {a_next}")
    a.append(a_next)

# Compute partial sum of a(n) from n=4 to n=10
partial_sum = sum(a[4:11])
print(f"Partial sum from n=4 to 10: {partial_sum}")

# Approximate the sum including the infinite tail by summing until terms are negligible
sum_total = 0
for val in a[4:]:
    sum_total += val
    if abs(val) < 1e-8:
        break

# Now, compute the final radical expression
import math
inner = a1 + math.sqrt(a2 + math.sqrt(a3 + sum_total))
answer = math.sqrt(inner)
print(f"Estimated answer: {answer}")
```
