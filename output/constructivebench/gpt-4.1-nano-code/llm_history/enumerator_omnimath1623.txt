The problem appears to involve enumerating pairs of integers (a, b) within the ranges 1 to 20, and identifying those that satisfy a specific condition involving their linear combination with irrational numbers √2 and √3, and a custom remainder function. Since the code imports Mathlib and uses Lean syntax, but the goal is to produce a practical Python program, I will interpret the mathematical problem and generate code that:

- Enumerates pairs (a, b) with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 20.
- Defines a "remainder" function for real division.
- Checks whether the sum of the remainders of p (= a*√2 + b*√3) with respect to √2 and √3 equals √2.
- Counts how many such pairs satisfy this condition and outputs the count.

This approach aligns with the description and constraints. I'll select a small sample (a, b) within 1..20, compute and check the condition, and print each valid pair immediately to aid in conjecture.

```python
import math

# Define the remainder function: the fractional part after division
def remainder(x, d):
    q = x / d
    frac_part = q - math.floor(q)
    return frac_part * d

valid_pairs = 0

for a in range(1, 21):
    for b in range(1, 21):
        p = a * math.sqrt(2) + b * math.sqrt(3)
        r1 = remainder(p, math.sqrt(2))
        r2 = remainder(p, math.sqrt(3))
        # Check if sum of remainders equals sqrt(2)
        # Allow a tiny floating error margin
        if abs((r1 + r2) - math.sqrt(2)) < 1e-9:
            print(f"Valid pair: a={a}, b={b}")
            valid_pairs += 1

print(f"Total valid pairs: {valid_pairs}")
```
