  fun d => 28.3
has type
  (d : ℝ) → ?m.12 d : Type (max 0 ?u.7)
but is expected to have type
  ℝ : Type
Possible Fix: Check if the expected type aligns with the provided type..
. Enumerated Answers: Answer: 28.3. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The issue stems from defining `P2017AMCB_4_answer` as a function `(d : ℝ) → ℝ` instead of a constant `ℝ`. The abbreviation should directly specify the real number, not a function. Therefore, replacing `fun d : ℝ => 28.3` with `28.3` fixes the type mismatch. 

Based on the problem, since the answer is a constant real number, the fixed definition should be:

<<<28.3>>>
