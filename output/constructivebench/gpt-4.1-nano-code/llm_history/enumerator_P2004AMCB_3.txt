The problem involves solving the equation \(2^x \times 3^y = 1296\) for positive integers \(x, y\), and determining \(x + y\). To assist in formulating the answer, we should enumerate the possible pairs \((x, y)\) that satisfy this equation, then examine the sums \(x + y\).

Since \(1296 = 2^4 \times 3^4\), the possible exponents are constrained by the prime factorization. We can find all \((x, y)\) such that \(2^x \times 3^y = 1296\), i.e., where \(x \le 4\) and \(y \le 4\), with the product consistent with prime factors.

Enumerating all pairs with \(x, y \ge 1\), we'll check if \(2^x \times 3^y = 1296\), then record \(x + y\).

```python
# Enumerate all positive integer pairs (x, y) with 2^x * 3^y = 1296
# 1296 = 2^4 * 3^4, so x and y must satisfy 2^x divides 1296 and similarly for 3^y
# Since 2^x divides 2^4, x ranges from 1 to 4
# Similarly, y from 1 to 4

target = 1296
results = []

for x in range(1, 5):
    for y in range(1, 5):
        if 2**x * 3**y == target:
            results.append(x + y)
            print(f"x={x}, y={y}, x+y={x + y}")

# Output all possible sums
print("Possible sums of x + y:", sorted(set(results)))
```
