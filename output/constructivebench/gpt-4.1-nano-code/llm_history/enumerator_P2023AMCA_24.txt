This problem involves enumerating all sequences of finite sets (subsets of {0,...,9}) with certain conditions about their length and subset relations, and then counting how many such sequences exist modulo 10.

To approach this programmatically, we will:
- Generate sequences of subsets (from the 2^10 possible subsets).
- Enforce the maximum length of 10.
- Enforce the subset relation between consecutive sets in the sequence.
- Count the total number of sequences satisfying these constraints.

Since the problem is abstract, we'll interpret it as counting all such sequences of subsets with the given chaining property, and then compute the total count modulo 10.

Here's the implementation:

```python
from itertools import combinations, product

# Generate all subsets of {0,1,...,9}
all_subsets = []
for r in range(11):
    all_subsets.extend([frozenset(c) for c in combinations(range(10), r)])

# Precompute subset relation for efficiency
subset_relations = {}
for s1 in all_subsets:
    subset_relations[s1] = [s2 for s2 in all_subsets if s1.issubset(s2)]

count = 0

# Generate all sequences of length up to 10
# Sequence can be empty (length 0) or up to length 10
# For length 0: empty sequence
# For length >=1:
#    First element: any subset
#    Subsequent elements: subset from subset_relations of previous
# This enumerates all sequences satisfying the subset chain condition

# Count sequences for lengths 0 to 10
# Length 0 sequence: count as 1
count += 1  # Empty sequence

# For sequences of length >=1
for length in range(1, 11):
    # Start with choices for first element
    for first in all_subsets:
        # Initialize sequences with first
        sequences = [[first]]
        # Extend sequence
        for _ in range(1, length):
            new_sequences = []
            for seq in sequences:
                last = seq[-1]
                # Next element must be subset of last
                for next_subset in subset_relations[last]:
                    new_sequences.append(seq + [next_subset])
            sequences = new_sequences
        count += len(sequences)

print(count % 10)
```
