[write_program]
This appears to be a formal statement in Lean, involving summation from 1 to 100, asking to determine that sum. The problem likely asks for the sum of integers from 1 to 100, a common arithmetic series problem.

Since the sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n+1)/2, for n=100, the sum is 100*101/2=5050.

To assist in conjecturing, I will write a Python program that enumerates candidate sums, especially verifying the known formula and computing the sum directly, outputting intermediate results.

```python
# Enumerate possible sums from 1 to 100 and verify the formula
# The sum of the first n natural numbers: n(n+1)/2
# For n=100, sum should be 5050

n = 100
# Direct calculation
sum_direct = sum(range(1, n + 1))
print(f"Sum of integers from 1 to {n} computed directly: {sum_direct}")

# Verify with formula
sum_formula = n * (n + 1) // 2
print(f"Sum using formula n(n+1)/2: {sum_formula}")

# Enumerate all partial sums up to n for possible insights
partial_sums = []
current_sum = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    current_sum += i
    partial_sums.append((i, current_sum))
    # Output each partial sum
    print(f"Sum from 1 to {i}: {current_sum}")

# Confirm the total sum matches the formula
assert sum_direct == sum_formula
```
