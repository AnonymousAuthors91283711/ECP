The problem is asking to find all natural numbers \( n > 0 \) such that there exists a unique integer \( a \) with \( 0 \le a < n! \) satisfying \( a^n + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{n!} \). 

We can approach this by fixing small values of \( n \) and checking for such \( a \). The key is to find all solutions \( a \) and ensure uniqueness for each \( n \).

To do this efficiently:
- iterate over small \( n \), say from 1 to 20 (since factorial grows quickly).
- For each \( n \), iterate \( a \) from 0 up to \( n! - 1 \) and check if \( a^n + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{n!} \).
- Record cases where exactly one such \( a \) exists.

Let's implement this in Python.

```python
import math

# Set the upper limit for n to search for solutions
max_n = 20

# Store the n for which there exists exactly one a satisfying the conditions
solutions = []

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    fact = math.factorial(n)
    solutions_for_n = []
    for a in range(fact):
        if pow(a, n, fact) == (fact - 1) % fact:
            solutions_for_n.append(a)
    if len(solutions_for_n) == 1:
        print(f"n={n}, a={solutions_for_n[0]}")
        solutions.append(n)

# Output the list of all such n's
print("n values with exactly one solution:", solutions)
```
