This problem involves finding the minimal number greater than or equal to 100000 that is divisible by all of 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, then verifying some properties about it. Once we derive that minimal number, the problem checks the last digit of this number divided by 10.

Let's proceed by enumerating all combinations of multiples starting from the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. We'll generate candidates and find the minimal one â‰¥ 100000. Then we compute the required value and output the results.

```python
import math

# Compute the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers
def lcm_list(numbers):
    result = 1
    for num in numbers:
        result = (result * num) // math.gcd(result, num)
    return result

# Define the numbers involved
divisors = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]

# Compute the LCM of the divisors
lcm_value = lcm_list(divisors)

# Starting from the smallest multiple >= 100000
start_multiplier = (100000 + lcm_value - 1) // lcm_value

# Enumerate candidates until we find the minimal n >= 100000 divisible by all divisors
min_num = None
for k in range(start_multiplier, start_multiplier + 10):  # limit search range
    candidate = lcm_value * k
    if candidate >= 100000:
        min_num = candidate
        print(f"Candidate number: {candidate}")
        break

# Compute the value to verify: (min_num / 10) % 10
result = (min_num // 10) % 10
print("Answer:", result)
```
