The problem defines a recurrence relation for the sequence \( a(n) \) with initial conditions \( a(0) = 3 \), \( a(1) = 2 \), and \( a(n+2) = a(n+1) + a(n) \). We need to compute the sum:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^{8} \frac{a(n)}{a(n+1) \times a(n+2)}
\]

and possibly express the answer as a rational number.

---

Let's analyze the pattern and compute the sequence and sum explicitly:

- Sequence defined by Fibonacci-like recurrence: \( a(n+2) = a(n+1) + a(n) \)
- Initial: \( a(0)=3, a(1)=2 \)

Compute terms:

| n | \( a(n) \) | \( a(n+1) \) | \( a(n+2) \) | term \( \frac{a(n)}{a(n+1)a(n+2)} \) |
|---|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| 0 | 3          | 2            | 5            | \( \frac{3}{2 \times 5} = \frac{3}{10} \) |
| 1 | 2          | 5            | 7            | \( \frac{2}{5 \times 7} = \frac{2}{35} \) |
| 2 | 5          | 7            | 12           | \( \frac{5}{7 \times 12} = \frac{5}{84} \) |
| 3 | 7          | 12           | 19           | \( \frac{7}{12 \times 19} = \frac{7}{228} \) |
| 4 | 12         | 19           | 31           | \( \frac{12}{19 \times 31} = \frac{12}{589} \) |
| 5 | 19         | 31           | 50           | \( \frac{19}{31 \times 50} = \frac{19}{1550} \) |
| 6 | 31         | 50           | 81           | \( \frac{31}{50 \times 81} = \frac{31}{4050} \) |
| 7 | 50         | 81           | 131          | \( \frac{50}{81 \times 131}=\frac{50}{10611} \) |
| 8 | 81         | 131          | 212          | \( \frac{81}{131 \times 212} \) |

Now, sum all these fractions.

Express in Python as exact rational sums and simplify:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Initialize sequence according to recurrence
a = [3, 2]
for _ in range(2, 10):
    a.append(a[-1] + a[-2])  # Fibonacci-like recurrence

sum_total = Fraction(0, 1)
for n in range(0, 9):
    numerator = a[n]
    denominator = a[n+1] * a[n+2]
    sum_total += Fraction(numerator, denominator)

print("Sum as a rational number:", sum_total)
```

This code computes the sum exactly, streaming the result immediately. The final output will be a simplified rational number.

**Full code:**

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Sequence initialization
a = [3, 2]
for _ in range(2, 10):
    a.append(a[-1] + a[-2])  # recurrence: a(n+2) = a(n+1) + a(n)

sum_total = Fraction(0, 1)
for n in range(0, 9):
    sum_total += Fraction(a[n], a[n+1] * a[n+2])

print("Answer:", sum_total)
```

The problem involves a recurrence relation \( a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_n \) with initial values \( a_0=3 \), \( a_1=2 \). The Python code correctly models this recurrence (like Fibonacci, scaled differently), computes the sum of fractions \( a_n / (a_{n+1} a_{n+2}) \) for \( n=0 \) to 8, and should output a rational number.

However, the provided code fragment ends with an error: it does not print the computed sum. The output "Error: Program outputs empty result" suggests the script finishes without printing the sum.

Given the problem statement's requirements:
- The code should immediately print each candidate answer; since this is a fixed sum, only one answer is needed.
- The sequence is standard Fibonacci-like, with initial values \(a_0=3, a_1=2\).
- The sum can be computed exactly, but the code currently doesn't print the final sum or any partial answer during iteration.
- No explicit need to enumerate multiple answers or extremal values, only the correct total sum as a rational.

Therefore, the main issue is that the code does not output anything. To correct it:
- At the end, print `sum_total`.
- For compliance, it's better to print as a rational number, not as a floating **approximate**.

Since the program should be able to run and provide the answer, the fix is to add a print statement at the end of the code.

**Decision:** The original program is rejected because it doesn't produce output.

Corrected code:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Initialize sequence according to recurrence
a = [3, 2]
for _ in range(2, 10):
    a.append(a[-1] + a[-2])  # Fibonacci-like recurrence

sum_total = Fraction(0, 1)
for n in range(0, 9):
    numerator = a[n]
    denominator = a[n+1] * a[n+2]
    sum_total += Fraction(numerator, denominator)

print("Sum as a rational number:", sum_total)
```

This guarantees the program produces the answer immediately upon execution.
