abbrev P2005AMCA_6_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2005AMCA_6 :
  ∃ (t : ℝ), 0 < t ∧
  let josh_speed := (4/5) * (13 / t);
  let mike_speed := 13 / t;
  josh_speed * (2 * t) + mike_speed * t = 13 ∧
  mike_speed * t = P2005AMCA_6_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 13. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Considering the equalities, eliminating t yields mike_speed = 13 / t, and from the sum equation simplifies to 13, since substituting speeds cancels t. The problem reduces to the sum of distances equaling 13, with mike_speed = 13 / t. The appropriate closed-form is the direct value of Mike's distance.
