This problem appears to be an advanced, possibly functional-analytic or algebraic, equation detailing a specific relation between a function \(f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) and its compositions. It involves set equality of multisets of pairs, equating the multiset derived from \(f\) evaluated at certain expressions with those formed by another pattern involving \(f\). The core challenge is to understand what functions \(f\) satisfy this set identity universally.

Given the complexity, an effective approach is to analyze simple candidate functions like constant functions, linear functions, and the identity, then verify whether those fulfill the equality. To aid conjecture, we'll:

- Test obvious functions: \(f(x) = c\), \(f(x) = x\), \(f(x) = kx + m\).
- For each, check the set equality for small sample points (e.g., \(x, y \in \{-1, 0, 1\}\)).  
- Enumerate all such functions within feasible parameter ranges.  
- Collect solutions that satisfy the relation on all sample points, then hypothesize about the general set.

Here's the Python code to perform that reasoning, focusing on constant and linear functions for simplicity. It will print candidate functions that satisfy the relation on those sample points:

```python
import itertools

# Candidates: constant functions c, and linear functions k*x + m with small parameters
constants = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
ks = [-1, 0, 1]
ms = [-1, 0, 1]
samples = [-1, 0, 1]

def evaluate_f(f_type, x, c=None, k=None, m=None):
    if f_type == 'const':
        return c
    elif f_type == 'linear':
        return k * x + m

def check_relation(f_type, c=None, k=None, m=None):
    for x, y in itertools.product(samples, repeat=2):
        # Compute sets of pairs
        set1 = set()
        set2 = set()
        for (a, b) in [(x, y), (y, x)]:
            val1 = evaluate_f(f_type, a * evaluate_f(f_type, y, c, k, m) + 1, c, k, m)
            val2 = evaluate_f(f_type, b * evaluate_f(f_type, a, c, k, m) - 1, c, k, m)
            set1.add((val1, val2))
            val1_alt = evaluate_f(f_type, a, c, k, m)
            val2_alt = evaluate_f(f_type, b, c, k, m)
            set2.add((a * evaluate_f(f_type, y, c, k, m) + 1, y * evaluate_f(f_type, x, c, k, m) - 1))
        if set1 != set2:
            return False
    return True

# Store functions satisfying the relation
candidate_functions = []

# Check constant functions
for c in constants:
    if check_relation('const', c=c):
        candidate_functions.append(('const', c))

# Check linear functions
for k in ks:
    for m in ms:
        if check_relation('linear', k=k, m=m):
            candidate_functions.append(('linear', k, m))

# Print all candidates found
for fun in candidate_functions:
    if fun[0] == 'const':
        print(f"f(x) = {fun[1]}")
    elif fun[0] == 'linear':
        print(f"f(x) = {fun[1]}*x + {fun[2]}")
```
