The problem involves a cubic polynomial \(f(X) = X^3 + 3X - 1\), finding its roots, and then computing a double sum over pairs of roots, where the summand depends on whether the roots are distinct. The goal is to find integers \(m, n\) such that the sum equals \(\frac{m}{n}\), with additional conditions. Since the exact roots are algebraic, and the sum involves reciprocals of differences, this suggests symmetry and possibly root properties.

To approach this computationally:
- Approximate roots numerically.
- Compute the sum over pairs.
- Express the result as a simplified rational approximation.
- Search among small numerators and denominators for simple fractions that match or approximate the sum.
- Output the likely candidate, especially since the sum should be rational and with small numerator/denominator.

Here's the corresponding Python code to approximate the roots, compute the sum, and identify plausible \(m, n\):

```python
import numpy as np
from fractions import Fraction

# Polynomial coefficients for f(x) = x^3 + 3x - 1
coeffs = [1, 0, 3, -1]
roots = np.roots(coeffs)

# Filter real roots
roots_real = [r.real for r in roots if abs(r.imag) < 1e-9]

# Compute the sum over pairs of roots
sum_value = 0
for i, x in enumerate(roots_real):
    for j, y in enumerate(roots_real):
        if i != j:
            denom = x**3 + y**3
            if abs(denom) > 1e-12:
                sum_value += 1 / denom

# Approximate the sum as a fraction
frac = Fraction(sum_value).limit_denominator(1000)

# Search for simple numerator/denominator candidates
m, n = frac.numerator, frac.denominator

# Print the approximate roots and the sum
print("Roots (approximate):", roots_real)
print("Sum approximation:", sum_value)
print(f"Found rational approximation: {m}/{n}")

# Output the candidate m, n
print(f"m = {m}, n = {n}")
```

This script approximates roots, computes the sum, simplifies the fraction, and outputs plausible rational candidates for the sum, aiding in conjecturing the exact form.
