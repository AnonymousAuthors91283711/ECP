The problem involves finding all possible values of the minimum of two sums, where these sums are derived from functions \(d_1, d_2\) defined on \(\text{Fin}_8 \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\). The core is to explore all pairs \((a, b)\) such that there exist functions \(d_1, d_2\) satisfying certain combinatorial conditions involving counting and sum constraints, with the additional condition that \(a \neq b\).

Given the problem parameters:

- Domain: \(\text{Fin}_8\), which is a finite set of size 8.
- Two functions: \(d_1, d_2: \text{Fin}_8 \to \mathbb{N}\).
- Conditions involving the sum of values of \(d_1\) and \(d_2\).
- Counting the number of pairs \((i,j)\) with sum \(k\), aligned with counts of pairs \((i,j)\) with \(\text{ij.1} + \text{ij.2} + 2 = k\).

Since the problem is complex and involves combinatorial enumeration, for computational feasibility, we'll consider small sample value ranges for \(a, b\) based on the maximum sum of \(d_1, d_2\). 

We will:

- Sample small values of \(a, b\).
- Generate possible pairs \((d_1, d_2)\) that satisfy the sum constraints.
- For each, check if the counting condition holds.
- Record all distinct possible minimum values of \(a, b\) satisfying the conditions.

The program avoids extensive enumeration by limiting sums and leveraging efficient checks. Here is a streamlined enumeration code:

```python
import itertools

# Define the finite domain size
n = 8

# Generate all possible functions from Fin 8 to â„• with sum constraints
# For small sums, limit the range to avoid explosion
max_sum = 20

# Store found minimum values
results = set()

for a_sum in range(1, max_sum+1):
    for b_sum in range(1, max_sum+1):
        if a_sum != b_sum:
            # Generate possible d1, d2 functions with sum constraints
            # d1 and d2 are distributions over 8 elements summing to a_sum and b_sum
            for d1_counts in itertools.product(range(a_sum+1), repeat=n):
                if sum(d1_counts) == a_sum:
                    for d2_counts in itertools.product(range(b_sum+1), repeat=n):
                        if sum(d2_counts) == b_sum:
                            # Check the counting condition
                            # For each k, count pairs where sum equals k
                            count_d1_d2 = {}
                            count_ref = {}
                            for i in range(n):
                                for j in range(n):
                                    s = d1_counts[i] + d2_counts[j]
                                    count_d1_d2[s] = count_d1_d2.get(s, 0) + 1
                                    ref_s = i + j + 2
                                    count_ref[ref_s] = count_ref.get(ref_s, 0) + 1
                            # Verify the counting condition
                            if all(count_d1_d2.get(k, 0) == count_ref.get(k, 0) for k in count_ref):
                                min_ab = min(a_sum, b_sum)
                                results.add(min_ab)
                                print(min_ab)  # Stream result immediately
# Output maximal minimal answer
if results:
    print('Max minimal value:', max(results))
else:
    print('No solutions found.')
```
