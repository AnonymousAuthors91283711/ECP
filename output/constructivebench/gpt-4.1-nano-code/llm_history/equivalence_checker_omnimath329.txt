Ground Truth Answer: (31 - 3 * sqrt 53) / 2
Proposed Answer: 11
Let me analyze this problem carefully.

The equation given is:
x² + 9x + 2√(x²(9x)) = 121

First, let's simplify the square root term:
2√(x²(9x)) = 2√(9x³) = 2*3x^(3/2) = 6x^(3/2)

So the equation becomes:
x² + 9x + 6x^(3/2) = 121

The proposed answer is x = 11. Let's test this:
11² + 9*11 + 6*11^(3/2) = 121 + 99 + 6*11√11 ≈ 220 + 218.6 ≈ 438.6 ≠ 121

This clearly doesn't satisfy the equation. The ground truth answer is more complex and involves √53, which suggests it's the correct solution to the quadratic equation that would result from proper simplification.

The proposed answer of 11 is clearly incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the original equation.
