abbrev P2010AMCB_12_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2010AMCB_12 (x : ℝ) (hx : x > 0) : 5 * logb 2 x = 40 ↔ x = P2010AMCB_12_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate x = 256 satisfies 5 * log2 x ≈ 40. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The equation is 5 * log₂ x = 40, so dividing both sides by 5 gives log₂ x = 8, hence x = 2^8 = 256. 

Final answer: <<<256>>>
