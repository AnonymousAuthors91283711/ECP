abbrev omnimath3388_answer : ℚ × ℚ × ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3388 (p q r : ℚ) :
    p + 3*q + r = 3 ∧
    p + 2*q + 3*r = 3 ∧
    p + q + r = 2 ↔
    (p, q, r) = omnimath3388_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (5/4, 1/2, 1/4). Expected Answer Type: ℚ × ℚ × ℚ
The given system of equations suggests solving for (p, q, r). The pattern in the enumerated answer (5/4, 1/2, 1/4) indicates the unique solution. The pattern is consistent with solving the linear system and substituting back.  
Final answer:  
<<<(5/4, 1/2, 1/4)>>>
