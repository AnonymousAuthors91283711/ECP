The problem involves finding the least value of α > 0 such that the inequality holds for all positive x and y. The goal is to explore candidates for α, especially around critical points—likely the extremal, or boundary, cases where the inequality tightens. 

To systematically explore, we sample a small set of positive x,y values, especially symmetric (x=y) and some asymmetry to test the inequality. Since the inequality compares weighted geometric and arithmetic means with a parameter α, the critical point is often at some specific ratio, but without hardcoding the solution, we examine a small grid.

We will:
- Fix some small sample pairs (x,y).
- For each pair, test candidate α values starting from some small value upwards.
- For each α, check if the inequality holds for all sampled pairs.
- When an α satisfies all tested pairs, print it immediately.
- Since α > 0, start from a minimal positive value (e.g., 0.01) and increment.

This brute-force approach is approximate but complies with the task requirements to explore and print candidates. For a more thorough approach, refined step sizes or more points could be used, but given constraints, this balances efficiency and coverage.

```python
import math

# Sample pairs (x, y) to test the inequality
sample_points = [
    (1, 1),
    (0.5, 2),
    (2, 0.5),
    (1, 2),
    (2, 1),
    (0.1, 10),
    (10, 0.1),
    (1.5, 2.5),
    (2.5, 1.5),
]

def inequality_holds(alpha, points):
    for x, y in points:
        lhs = (x + y) / 2
        rhs = alpha * math.sqrt(x * y) + (1 - alpha) * math.sqrt((x ** 2 + y ** 2) / 2)
        if lhs < rhs - 1e-12:
            return False
    return True

# Search for the minimal alpha > 0 satisfying the inequality over sampled points
alpha = 0.01
max_alpha = 2.0  # arbitrarily large to find a candidate
step = 0.01
found_alphas = []

while alpha <= max_alpha:
    if inequality_holds(alpha, sample_points):
        print(f"Candidate alpha: {alpha}")
        found_alphas.append(alpha)
        break  # stop at first candidate; for more, continue increasing alpha
    alpha += step

# Optionally, output the smallest alpha that works
if found_alphas:
    print(f"Approximate minimal alpha: {found_alphas[0]}")
```
