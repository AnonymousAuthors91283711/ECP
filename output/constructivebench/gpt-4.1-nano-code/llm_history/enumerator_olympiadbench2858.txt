The problem asks to find the number of integer solutions \((x, y)\) with \(x > 0\) and \(y > 0\) satisfying the equation \(x^2 - 8x + y^2 + 4y = 5\). We will enumerate possible solutions by parametrizing and looping over small positive integer values for \(x\) and \(y\). To make it efficient, we restrict ourselves to reasonable bounds based on the structure of the equation.

```python
# Enumerate solutions to x^2 - 8x + y^2 + 4y = 5 with x > 0, y > 0
solutions = []

# Set a reasonable bound to avoid infinite search; based on the quadratic growth
max_x, max_y = 50, 50

for x in range(1, max_x + 1):
    for y in range(1, max_y + 1):
        if x**2 - 8*x + y**2 + 4*y == 5:
            solutions.append((x, y))
            print((x, y))
print("Total solutions:", len(solutions))
```
