theorem P2024HMMTnov_guts_2 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | n > 72 ∧ primeFactors n = primeFactors 72} P2024HMMTnov_guts_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 144. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern shows that the answer is the smallest multiple of 72 with prime factors exactly the same as 72's prime factors, but greater than 72. The minimal such number is 144, as its prime factorization is 2^4 * 3^2, same as 72's, and it exceeds 72.

<<<144>>>
