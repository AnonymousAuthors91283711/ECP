The problem seems to involve generating a sequence similar to Pascal's triangle (or a related polynomial sequence). The `build_row` function produces a list of numbers for a given `n`, starting with the base case, then iterating to build subsequent rows. We want to find the last digit of the sum of the 2023rd row.

Key observations:
- The initial rows match these sequences:
  - row 0: [1], sum = 1
  - row 1: [1, 1], sum = 2
- The sequence of sums can be computed iteratively based on previous sums:
  - For row n + 2, if `prev` is the previous row, the sum of its interior is `sum(prev) + length(prev)`, because each interior element is built as `a + b + 1`.
- Efficiently, the sum of row n + 2 can be expressed in terms of the previous sums, perhaps leading to a recurrence relation.

Let's analyze the pattern of the sum:
- sum(build_row(0)) = 1
- sum(build_row(1)) = 2
- For build_row(2):
  - previous row: [1,1], sum=2
  - interior elements: zipWith (+) [1,1] [1], which is [1+1+1]= [3]
  - new row: [1] + [3] + [1], sum=1+3+1=5
- For build_row(3):
  - previous row: [1,3,1], sum=5
  - interior: zipWith (+): [1+3+1]= [5], next interior: [3+1+1]= [5]
  - new row: [1,5,5,1], sum = 1+5+5+1=12

Pattern of sums:
- row 0: sum =1
- row 1: sum=2
- row 2: sum=5
- row 3: sum=12

Observing the pattern:
- sum(0)=1
- sum(1)=2
- sum(2)=5
- sum(3)=12

Differences:
- 2-1=1
- 5-2=3
- 12-5=7

Second differences:
- 3-1=2
- 7-3=4

This pattern implies the sum grows rapidly; perhaps the sum follows a recurrence relation. Testing for the pattern:
- sum(n+1) = 2*sum(n) + 1? Let's check:
  - 1→2? 2*1+0=2 matches.
  - 2→5? 2*2+1=5 matches.
  - 5→12? 2*5+2=12? (No, 2*5+2=12) yes, matches.
  
But not consistent with a simple recurrence.

Try to find a direct relation:
- sum(n) seems to obey:
  sum(0)=1
  sum(1)=2
  sum(2)=5
  sum(3)=12

Testing the growth:
- sum(n) = 2 * sum(n-1) + (?), perhaps 2 * sum(n-1) + something.

Alternatively, from the pattern, note that:

Let's check if sum(n) relates to 2^n.

- 2^0=1, sum=1
- 2^1=2, sum=2
- 2^2=4, sum=5 (not match)
- 2^3=8, sum=12 (not match)

Close but not exact.

Alternatively, noting that:
- sum(0)=1
- sum(1)=2
- sum(2)=5
- sum(3)=12

Check ratios:
- 2/1=2
- 5/2=2.5
- 12/5=2.4

No clear pattern.

Implementing the sequences explicitly is a shortcut. Since the computation is manageable, we can generate the row sums iteratively for n=0..2023, then take sum mod 10.

Here's the plan:
- Use the build_row function to build the 2023rd row.
- Sum its elements.
- Output the last digit.

Optimization:
- Since build_row decently efficiently uses list construction, just execute it once for n=2023.

Implement accordingly.

```python
# Generate the 2023rd row and output sum mod 10
def main():
    row_number = 2023
    row = build_row(row_number)
    total_sum = sum(row)
    last_digit = total_sum % 10
    print(last_digit)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The original program, as provided, is incomplete and will produce no output because the `build_row` function is defined but not invoked, and the main execution is missing. Additionally, the Python code is incomplete: there's no function to build the row, and the program does not produce any output, only describes what should happen.

**Judgement**: The code will not run correctly or produce any output, so it violates the criteria for instant output and correctness. Therefore, it should be rejected.

**Correction Plan**:
- Implement a function `build_row` in Python that constructs the 2023rd row following a similar logic.
- Immediately compute and print the sum of the row's elements modulo 10.
- As requested, do not hardcode answers, nor compute overly large data unnecessarily.
- Since the internal `build_row` relies on an efficient approach, recursion with memoization or iterative construction is preferable.

**Note**: The code indicates the row is similar to a modified Pascal's triangle with an added '1' in the interior. To emulate that, we can iteratively build each row from the previous one. The row length grows roughly exponentially, but for manageable implementation, an iterative approach is efficient.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def build_row(n):
    # Build the (n)-th row using iterative approach
    row = [1]
    for _ in range(n):
        # Generate the next row based on current row
        interior = [row[i] + row[i+1] + 1 for i in range(len(row)-1)]
        row = [1] + interior + [1]
    return row

def main():
    row_number = 2023
    row = build_row(row_number)
    total_sum = sum(row)
    last_digit = total_sum % 10
    print(last_digit)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Note on efficiency**: This code may take some time due to the exponential growth in row size (~2^n), but we focus on correctness here. For large `n`, a more optimized approach or mathematical shortcut would be ideal. Nevertheless, this satisfies the program's intended behavior.

**Final decision**: <<<False>>>
```python
def build_row(n):
    # Build the (n)-th row using iterative approach
    row = [1]
    for _ in range(n):
        # Generate the next row based on
