This problem involves examining numbers and their primality, specifically pairs of non-prime numbers \( n \) and \( n - 2 \). The goal is to find an \( n \) such that neither \( n \) nor \( n - 2 \) is prime, and confirm if this \( n \) matches a certain answer.

Since the statement aims to find a counterexample to the statement "for all \( n \), if \( n \) is not prime then \( n - 2 \) is not prime," and further specifies an \( n \) that satisfies both being non-prime with \( n - 2 \) also non-prime, the problem reduces to searching for such \( n \).

Given that this is a high-school contest-style problem, we can limit our search to small \( n \). We iterate over \( n \) from 4 upwards (since for \( n < 4 \), the subtraction and primality checks are trivial), check whether both \( n \) and \( n - 2 \) are composite, and print out any such \( n \).

Here's a Python program that performs this enumeration:

```python
# Function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

found_candidates = []

# Search for n where both n and n-2 are not prime
for n in range(4, 100):  # sample small range
    if not is_prime(n) and not is_prime(n - 2):
        print(n)
        found_candidates.append(n)

# If needed, identify the minimal such n
if found_candidates:
    print("Minimum such n:", min(found_candidates))
```
