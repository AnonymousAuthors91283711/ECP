The problem defines a function \(f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) satisfying:

1. There exists some \(n\) with \(f(n) \neq 0\).
2. For all \(x, y\), \(f(x y) = f(x) + f(y)\). This suggests a multiplicative-additive property resembling a logarithm.
3. The set of all \(n\) such that for all \(k < n\), \(f(k) = f(n - k)\) is infinite.

The theorem states that the above is equivalent to the existence of some \(a, p\) with \(p\) prime, such that \(f = omnimath4100_answer\, a\, p\).

Given the nature of the functional equation \(f(x y) = f(x) + f(y)\), solutions are known to be of the form \(f(n) = c \cdot v(n)\), where \(v(n)\) is the additive valuation (like exponent of a prime in \(n\)), or related to such valuations.

We need to produce candidate solutions \(f\). Since the set \(S = \{ n : \forall k < n, f(k)=f(n - k) \}\) is infinite, and the property resembles symmetry conditions, we suspect \(f\) might be proportional to \(\log_p(n)\) or similar.

To explore this, enumerate small primes \(p\) and simple functions \(f(n) = a \cdot v_p(n)\) where \(v_p(n)\) is the exponent of \(p\) in \(n\), with \(a\) a small integer.

```python
# Enumerate candidate solutions for the functional equation
# Candidate solutions are of the form f(n) = a * v_p(n)
# v_p(n): exponent of prime p in n
# For simplicity, choose small primes p and small coefficients a
# For each p and a, define f(n) and test some properties

primes = [2, 3, 5]
coefficients = [1, 2]

# We'll generate functions f(n) for small n and check behaviors
max_n = 20  # limit for enumeration

for p in primes:
    for a in coefficients:
        def v_p(n, p=p):
            count = 0
            while n % p == 0 and n > 0:
                n //= p
                count += 1
            return count

        print(f"Candidate: prime p={p}, coefficient a={a}")
        for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
            print(f"n={n}, f(n)={a * v_p(n)}")
```
