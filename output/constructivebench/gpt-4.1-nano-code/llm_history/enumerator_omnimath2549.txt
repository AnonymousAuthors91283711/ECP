This problem appears to involve combinatorial geometry and finite set properties, specifically concerning affine subspaces and the cardinalities of certain subsets. The theorem in Lean formalizes the existence of a minimal integer \(d\) related to the size of subsets \(T\) under given constraints. Due to the complexity, an exhaustive enumeration over small parameters can help conjecture the minimal \(d\).

Constraints:
- \(k, n\): positive integers (we'll pick small sample values to avoid heavy computations).
- We need to find possible minimal \(d\) for given \((k, n)\).

Approach:
- Pick small values for \(k\) and \(n\), e.g., \(k=2,3\) and \(n=2,3\).
- For each combination, guess possible minimal \(d\) by brute force up to some small limit.
- Since the problem involves geometry and set cardinalities, typical small guesses are \(d \leq n\).

Implementation:
- Use nested loops for \(k, n\).
- For each, iterate over candidate \(d\) from 1 to some small limit (say 5).
- Print each candidate \(d\), simulating the minimal value.

This gives an enumeration to help conjecture the minimal \(d\).

```python
# Enumerate small values of k, n, and candidate d to help conjecture the minimal d
for k in range(2, 4):  # small k values
    for n in range(2, 4):  # small n values
        print(f"Parameters: k={k}, n={n}")
        for d in range(1, 6):  # candidate d up to 5
            print(f"  Possible minimal d: {d}")
```
