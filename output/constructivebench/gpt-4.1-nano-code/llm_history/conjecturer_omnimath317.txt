open Function Real

abbrev omnimath317_answer : Set (ℝ → ℝ) := sorry
theorem omnimath317 (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
  (∀ x y z, x ≠ 0 ∧ y ≠ 0 ∧ z ≠ 0 → x * y * z = 1 → 
    f x ^ 2 - f y * f z = x * (x + y + z) * (f x + f y + f z)) ↔ 
  f ∈ omnimath317_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Constant solution: f(x) = 0
Linear solution: f(x) = 0 * x
. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
<<<{ fun x : ℝ => 0 }>>>

Explanation: The enumerated solutions show that the constant zero function satisfies the functional equation, and any linear solution reduces to zero. Therefore, the unique solution set is the singleton {0}.
