This problem is from a math contest context, asking to find the least value of r (a real number) satisfying certain inequalities involving constants t, t', and an expression involving (10 - r). To enumerate possible answers, we'll try a small grid of r values between 0 and 10 and check the inequalities. Since the requirement is to find the least r satisfying the conditions, we'll start from 0 and go upward, and report the first r that satisfies all conditions.

The key steps:
- Assign small sample r values (e.g., from 0 to 10 in steps)
- For each r, compute t, t', and check the inequalities
- When the inequalities are satisfied, print and stop

This approach maximizes efficiency by early stopping at the minimal satisfying r. It does not hardcode the answer and enumerates systematically.

```python
# Enumerate r from 0 to 10 in steps of 0.01
step = 0.01
found = False
r = 0.0
while r <= 10:
    t = 0.25
    t_prime = t * 60  # t' = t * 60
    # Conditions:
    # 0 ≤ r
    # (10 - r) * t' ≤ 30
    if r >= 0 and (10 - r) * t_prime <= 30:
        print(f"r = {r:.2f}")
        found = True
        break  # found the least r satisfying the conditions
    r += step

# Optional: if no exact match found, could relax precision; here, the code stops at first valid r
```
