This problem involves finding all \( x \) in some finite set \( xs \subseteq \mathbb{R} \) such that \( 0 < x < \pi \) and a specific trigonometric identity holds:
\[
1 + \frac{\sin x}{\sin 4x} = \frac{\sin 3x}{\sin 2x}
\]
and also that the sum of all such \( x \) equals an unknown answer.

To explore possible solutions, I will:
- Select sample values for \( x \) within the interval (0, \(\pi\))
- Check the given equation approximately
- Find exact solutions where feasible
- Limit the enumeration to a manageable set

Here's the code that enumerates candidate solutions and verifies the condition approximately, printing results as found:

```python
import math

# Define the target interval
start, end = 0, math.pi
# Sample points in the interval
samples = [i * math.pi / 10 for i in range(1, 10)]  # 0.1π, 0.2π, ..., 0.9π

solutions = []
for x in samples:
    # Avoid points where denominators might be zero
    if math.sin(4 * x) == 0 or math.sin(2 * x) == 0:
        continue
    lhs = 1 + math.sin(x) / math.sin(4 * x)
    rhs = math.sin(3 * x) / math.sin(2 * x)
    # Check approximately (within tolerance)
    if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-6:
        print(f"Solution x ≈ {x:.4f}, sin x={math.sin(x):.4f}")
        solutions.append(x)
# Summing solutions, approximate
total_sum = sum(solutions)
print(f"Sum of solutions: {total_sum:.4f}")
```
