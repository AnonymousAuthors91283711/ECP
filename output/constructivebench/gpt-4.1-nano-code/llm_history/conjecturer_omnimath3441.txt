  {n : ℕ | 10^n ≤ 2014 ∧ 2014 ≤ 10^(n+1)} = omnimath3441_answer :=
sorry
. Enumerated answers: 3. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The inequality 10^n ≤ 2014 < 10^(n+1) indicates n is the unique integer satisfying 10^n ≤ 2014 < 10^(n+1). Since 10^3 = 1000 ≤ 2014 < 10^4 = 10000, the only such n is 3. Thus the set contains exactly 3.
