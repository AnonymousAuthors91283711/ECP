5. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℝ
Based on the pattern of enumerated answers and typical polynomial evaluations, the value of eval (-1/2) Q appears to be independent of n and symmetric around zero, likely corresponding to the coefficient related to Q's degree and the problem structure. The pattern suggests a constant value (-1) fitting the symmetry and the known possible solutions.  
Thus, the conjectured answer is:  
<<<fun n : ℕ => -1>>>
