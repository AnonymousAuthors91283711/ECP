abbrev olympiadbench2482_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2482 (x : ℝ) :
    (3 : ℝ)^(x + 2) + (2 : ℝ)^(x + 2) + (2 : ℝ)^x = (2 : ℝ)^(x + 5) + (3 : ℝ)^x ↔ x = olympiadbench2482_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x ≈ 3.0000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the solution involves powers and their exponents; we seek x satisfying the equation. From clues, x ≈ 3.  
\(\because\) Simplify the equation and find the x that balances the powers and coefficients:  
\(3^{x + 2} + 2^{x + 2} + 2^{x} = 2^{x + 5} + 3^{x}\).  
Rearranged, the dominant powers balance at \(x=3\).  
\(\Rightarrow\) the exact closed-form answer is \(3\).
