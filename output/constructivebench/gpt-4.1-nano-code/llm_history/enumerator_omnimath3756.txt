This problem asks us to find the greatest natural number \( n \) such that there exists a finite set \( s \subseteq \mathbb{N} \), with all positive elements, satisfying the condition that for any two distinct elements \( x, y \in s \), their sum is a power of two.

The key parts:
- \( s \subseteq \mathbb{N} \), \( 0 < x \) for all \( x \in s \).
- For all distinct \( x, y \in s \), \( x + y = 2^k \) for some \( k \).

Our goal: Find the maximum possible \( n = |s| \), and the corresponding set \( s \).

Since the problem resembles finding large sets where pairwise sums are powers of two, and all elements are positive, it's natural to start small:
- Attempt small sets, verify the sum-powers-of-two property.
- For each, check the size \( |s| \).
- As the sum of any two elements must be a power of two, and all elements are positive, the smallest sums are 2, 4, 8, etc.

Let's implement a brute-force search over small sets, checking all combinations.

```python
# Enumerate small sets of positive integers where every pair sums to a power of two
import itertools

def is_power_of_two(n):
    return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0

max_size = 0
best_sets = []

# We set an upper limit for candidate elements for computational feasibility
max_element = 20

for size in range(2, 8):  # small sizes to find maximum
    # Generate all possible sets of the given size
    for s in itertools.combinations(range(1, max_element + 1), size):
        sset = set(s)
        valid = True
        for x, y in itertools.combinations(s, 2):
            ssum = x + y
            if not is_power_of_two(ssum):
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            print(f"Found set of size {size}: {s}")
            if size > max_size:
                max_size = size
                best_sets = [s]
            elif size == max_size:
                best_sets.append(s)

print(f"Maximum set size: {max_size}")
print("Examples of maximum sets:")
for s in best_sets:
    print(s)
```
