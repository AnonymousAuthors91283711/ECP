[write_program]
This problem asks us to find all pairs (x, y) of real numbers satisfying the equation \((x + y)^2 = (x + 1)(y - 1)\). Our goal for the Python program is to enumerate possible solutions based on parametric or sampled approaches, focusing on demonstrating candidate solutions and guiding potential conjecture.

Since the problem involves continuous variables, we cannot check all real pairs. Instead, we'll consider small sample ranges for x and y, with incremental steps, and test the equation. We will stream solutions as we find them. To keep output manageable, we limit ourselves to a small range, say x, y in [-10, 10], step 0.5, to observe patterns and infer solutions.

The program:
- iterates over x, y in [-10, 10],
- checks if the equation holds within a small numerical tolerance,
- prints each solution immediately on discovery.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (x, y) in small ranges to find solutions to (x + y)^2 = (x + 1)(y - 1)
import math

# Define search grid parameters
x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max = -10, 10, -10, 10
step = 0.5
tolerance = 1e-6

x = x_min
while x <= x_max:
    y = y_min
    while y <= y_max:
        lhs = (x + y)**2
        rhs = (x + 1)*(y - 1)
        if abs(lhs - rhs) < tolerance:
            print(f"Solution: x = {x}, y = {y}")
        y += step
    x += step
```
