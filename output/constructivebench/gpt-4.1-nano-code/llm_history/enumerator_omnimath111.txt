This problem involves analyzing numbers n such that for all k from 1 to 9, the fractional part of n divided by 10^k exceeds n divided by 10^10. We need to find how many such n exist, presumably including boundary cases, to determine the cardinality.

Given the nature of the problem, the key points are:
- For large n, the fractional parts tend to be small.
- The fractional part of n / 10^k is n mod 10^k divided by 10^k.
- The inequality involves comparing n mod 10^k over 10^k with n / 10^10.

Our goal:
- Enumerate small n values (since large n typically won't satisfy the strict inequality due to the fractional part being small).
- For each n, verify the inequality for all k from 1 to 9.
- Count all such n, and return this count.

The approach:
- Set an upper bound for n (say up to 10^10, because beyond that the fractional parts become too small).
- For each n in 1 to 10^10: check the inequality.
- Stream results when the criteria are met.

Let's implement this careful enumeration efficiently.

```python
# Enumerate n from 1 to 10^10
# For each n, check for all k in 1..9
# The fractional part of n / 10^k is (n mod 10^k) / 10^k
# We want fractional part > n / 10^10

limit = 10**10
count = 0

for n in range(1, limit + 1):
    s = True
    n_div_10_10 = n / 10**10
    for k in range(1, 10):
        fractional_part = (n % 10**k) / 10**k
        if not (fractional_part > n_div_10_10):
            s = False
            break
    if s:
        print(n)
        count += 1

print(f"Total interesting numbers: {count}")
```

This code searches for all `n` up to 10^10 that satisfy the condition. Since the total could be large, you might include a reasonable upper bound or optimize further.

**Note:** Given the pure enumeration can be computationally intensive, in presence of the example, you might limit the upper bound to smaller values for demonstration, e.g., `limit = 10^5`, or analyze the structure mathematically to derive the count without full enumeration. However, for completeness and following instructions, the full enumeration is provided.
