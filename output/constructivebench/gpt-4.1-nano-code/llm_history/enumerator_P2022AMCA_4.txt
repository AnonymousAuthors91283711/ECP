The problem asks to find a unique natural number \( n \) such that:
- \( n > 0 \),
- \( \text{lcm}(n, 18) = 180 \),
- \( \gcd(n, 45) = 15 \),
- and the sum of the digits of \( n \) in base 10.

Our goal is to enumerate candidate \( n \) values satisfying these conditions and identify the one that matches the problem's constraints.

Key observations:
- \( \gcd(n, 45) = 15 \) implies \( 15 \mid n \) and \( \gcd(n/15, 45/15) = 1 \).
- \( 45/15 = 3 \), so \( \gcd(n/15, 3) = 1 \), hence \( n/15 \) is coprime with 3.
- \( \text{lcm}(n, 18) = 180 \) imposes constraints on factors of \( n \) and 18.

We will generate candidate \( n \) values divisible by 15, check these conditions, and compute the digit sum.

```python
# Enumerate candidate n satisfying gcd and lcm constraints, then find the digit sum
def digit_sum(x):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(x))

results = []

for n in range(15, 1000, 15):  # Starting from 15, step by 15 to satisfy gcd condition
    # Check if gcd(n, 45) = 15
    if (n % 45) == 15:
        # Check lcm(n, 18) == 180
        # lcm = (n * 18) // gcd(n, 18)
        from math import gcd
        if (n * 18) // gcd(n, 18) == 180:
            s = digit_sum(n)
            print(f"n={n}, gcd={gcd(n,45)}, lcm={gcd(n,18)}*{18}//{gcd(n,18)}={180}, digit_sum={s}")
            results.append((n, s))

# The problem states the answer is unique, so pick the one with the digit sum that satisfies the conditions
# Here, we select the first matched result
if results:
    n_correct, digit_sum_value = results[0]
    print(f"Answer: n={n_correct}, digit sum={digit_sum_value}")
```

This code finds all possible \( n \) values that satisfy the constraints, prints debug info for each, and isolates the unique answer based on the conditions.
