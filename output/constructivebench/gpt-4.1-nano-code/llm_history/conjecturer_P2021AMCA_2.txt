The error in your current code arises because `a` and `b` are not recognized within the scope of the definition of `P2021AMCA_2_answer`. When defining an `abbrev` or `def` in Lean, any free variables used in its definition must be explicitly declared as parameters of the abbreviation or function. Without this, Lean cannot resolve `a` and `b` as identifiers, leading to the "unknown identifier" errors.

Analyzing your enumerated patterns, test cases show that the solutions align with cases where either both are zero, or one is zero and the other is non-negative. The logical condition that captures this pattern is:

- `a ≥ 0` and `b = 0`, or
- `a = 0` and `b ≥ 0`.

These cases include the origin `(0,0)` as well as points lying on the coordinate axes in the positive direction.

Hence, the correct way to define `P2021AMCA_2_answer` is to:

- parameterize it over `a` and `b`.
- define the answer condition based on the above logical cases.

**Proposed fixed answer:**

<<<fun a b : ℝ => (a ≥ 0 ∧ b = 0) ∨ (a = 0 ∧ b ≥ 0)>>>

This is a closed-form in Lean that captures the enumerated pattern, respects your logical observations, and is properly parameterized with `a` and `b`.
