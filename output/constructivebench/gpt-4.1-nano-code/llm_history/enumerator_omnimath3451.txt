[write_program]
This appears to be a mathematical problem involving the computation of specific values related to given parameters. Although the code is in Lean (a proof assistant language), the core calculations involve straightforward division, and no complex enumeration seems necessary based on the provided code snippet. Presumably, the question might be about computing the sum of these two specific quantities `m_last` and `s_last`, which are given as `100 / 1.25` and `100 / 0.8` respectively.

Given the structure, the main task is to evaluate these two values and sum them. Since the request is to write a Python program that enumerates possible answers, and the problem seems to be about straightforward numeric calculation, I will write a Python script that performs these calculations with a focus on exact arithmetic where possible, then outputs the sum.

This script will:
- Calculate `m_last = 100 / 1.25`
- Calculate `s_last = 100 / 0.8`
- Output their sum immediately after computation

Because the problem wording suggests not hardcoding the answer but computing it, weâ€™ll compute these values directly.

```python
# Python program to compute m_last, s_last, and their sum as per the described parameters.

# Calculate m_last and s_last
m_last = 100 / 1.25
s_last = 100 / 0.8

# Output the individual values and their sum
print(f"m_last = {m_last}")
print(f"s_last = {s_last}")
print(f"Sum = {m_last + s_last}")
```
