This problem asks to find a function `f : Fin 8 → ℕ+` satisfying a complex divisibility pattern between pairs of elements in the finite set of size 8. The pattern specifies exactly which pairs (i, j) should have divisible values, effectively encoding a graph of edges (where divisibility corresponds to edges) with a particular structure. We need to generate candidate functions that satisfy these divisibility constraints for all pairs.

Given the explicit pairs specified, the main approach is to:
- Encode the pairs indicating divisibility constraints.
- Assign values to each index `i` that satisfy these constraints.
- For simplicity, attempt small positive integers (like 1, 2, 3, ...) and check whether the divisibility rules are satisfied.
- Enumerate possible assignments efficiently, pruning impossible options early.

Let's implement a backtracking solution that:
- Iterates over small candidate values.
- Checks the divisibility constraints for each pair.
- Streams solutions when constraints are satisfied.

Because the problem is combinatorial and constraints are strict, limiting to small values will greatly reduce the search space.

```python
def check_constraints(f):
    # Define the pairs with divisibility conditions
    pairs = [
        (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4),
        (1, 3), (1, 5),
        (2, 3), (2, 6),
        (3, 7),
        (4, 5), (4, 6),
        (5, 7),
        (6, 7)
    ]
    for i, j in pairs:
        if not (f[i] % f[j] == 0 or f[j] % f[i] == 0):
            return False
    return True

def backtrack(index, current_f):
    if index == 8:
        # Found a valid assignment; print it
        print(current_f)
        return
    # Try small positive integers for current index
    for val in range(1, 4):  # limit to values 1..3 for efficiency
        current_f[index] = val
        if check_constraints(current_f):
            backtrack(index + 1, current_f)

# Initialize and run
f = [0] * 8
backtrack(0, f)
```

The problem asks to find an assignment of positive integers \(f : \{0,1,\dots,7\} \to \mathbb{N}^+\) satisfying specific divisibility conditions and to output all solutions immediately when found. The code attempts a backtracking with small values (1-3), checks the constraints, and prints solutions. However, since the problem's constraints include specific divisibility relations only between certain pairs, and the current code tests only small values, it might miss valid solutions with larger numbers if they exist beyond 3.

Furthermore, the overall problem likely admits solutions with bigger numbers (making small values insufficient), but the code limits the search to 1..3, which may cause no solutions to be found, resulting in an empty output. Also, the original code does not mention the ordering or constraint sizes explicitly, and the problem content suggests some specific solutions are expected.

Given that, the current implementation outputs nothing, which is incorrect because solutions probably exist with larger values. To improve and correct the code:

- Remove the small upper bound limit; try larger numbers.
- To avoid excessive computation, set a reasonable upper limit (say 10 or 20) for the search.
- Print each solution immediately when found.
- Enumerate all solutions to respect the problem's request for streaming solutions.
- No need to hardcode the answer or assume the exact values, just explore systematically.

**Summary of judgment:**
The code currently produces no output because the search space is limited and no solutions exist in 1..3. If solutions exist with higher values, the code needs to explore higher ranges. Alternatively, if no solutions exist at all, the output remains empty, which isn't a valid solution.

**Decision:**
Since the code produces no solutions despite the problem likely having some, and the problem asks for solutions, the current code doesn't fulfill the requirement and should be rejected.

<<<False>>>

**Corrected program:**

```python
def check_constraints(f):
    pairs = [
        (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4),
        (1, 3), (1, 5),
        (2, 3), (2, 6),
        (3, 7),
        (4, 5), (4, 6),
        (5, 7),
        (6, 7)
    ]

The problem as described involves verifying the existence of a function f from the 8-element finite set to positive integers satisfying a specific divisibility adjacency condition, which is equivalent to a certain graph being representable by assigning positive integers to vertices such that adjacency corresponds to divisibility.

Since the provided code is just a high-level theorem statement with 'sorry' placeholders and no actual code, the program's output for enumeration is 'Error: Program is empty,' meaning it does not generate any candidate solutions.

**Judgment:**

- Because the code neither implements the solution nor enumerates any candidates, it does not produce answers that fulfill the problem's goal.
- To accept a solution, the program must generate candidate functions satisfying the conditions, print them as found, and determine if a suitable one exists.
- The current state is incomplete and non-functional.

**Decision:**

<<<False>>>

### Corrected Python Program:

Below is a version that enumerates potential functions f: Fin 8 → ℕ+ with small positive integer values (e.g., 1–10), checks whether they satisfy the divisibility conditions only for the pairs listed, and prints any solutions found immediately as they are discovered. It searches for functions that satisfy exactly the specified adjacency constraints, taking advantage of symmetry and pruning.

```python
import itertools

# Pairs of indices where divisibility should hold
required_pairs = [
    (0,1), (1,0),
    (0,2), (2,0),
    (0,4), (4,0),
    (1,3), (3,1),
    (1,5), (5,1),
    (2,3), (3,2),
    (2,6), (6,2),
    (3,7), (7,3),
    (4,5), (5,4),
    (4,6), (6,4),
    (5,7), (7,5),
    (6,7), (7,6)
]

# Pairs where no divisibility should hold
forbidden_pairs = [
    (0,3), (3,0),
    (0,5), (5,0),
    (0,6), (6,0),
    (1,2), (2,1),
    (1,4), (4,1),
    (1,7), (7,1),
    (2,4),
