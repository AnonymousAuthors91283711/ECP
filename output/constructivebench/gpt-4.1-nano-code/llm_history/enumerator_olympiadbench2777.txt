This problem involves binomial coefficients and conditions on n. Since the statement involves choosing between n and 17 from T-3, and given T=43, we are to find a specific value for `olympiadbench2777_answer` such that `(T - 3).choose 17 = (T - 3).choose n` iff `n = olympiadbench2777_answer`, under the constraints on n.

Because the binomial coefficient symmetry states that for 0 ≤ n ≤ T-3, `(T-3).choose n = (T-3).choose T-3 - n`. To find `n` such that:

`(T-3).choose 17 = (T-3).choose n`.

Given T=43, T-3=40.

Looking for all n where:

`40 choose 17 = 40 choose n`

which, by symmetry, also holds at n=40 - 17 = 23.

Additional restrictions:
- n > 0
- n ≠ 17

Thus, potential candidates for n are 17 (but excluded), 23, 40 - 17 = 23.

Therefore, the only candidate answer that satisfies `(T - 3).choose n` equality with 17 is n=23.

The program will enumerate n=1 to 39, check which satisfy the condition, and print the candidate answer.

```python
# Enumerate n from 1 to 39 to find all n where C(40,17) = C(40,n)
import math

T_minus_3 = 40
target = math.comb(T_minus_3, 17)

for n in range(1, T_minus_3):
    if n != 17:
        if math.comb(T_minus_3, n) == target:
            print(f'n = {n}')
            print(f'Corresponding answer: {n}')
```
