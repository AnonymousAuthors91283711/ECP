The problem involves solving the equation x² + floor(x/2) + floor(x/3) = 10 over the real numbers, and finding the set of solutions. To approach this, we can test a small range of real values because the equation involves quadratic growth plus floor functions, which change at integer boundaries. We'll search over a reasonable interval around the potential solutions, checking points at small increments, and record the solutions when the equation holds exactly.

Here's the Python code to enumerate possible solutions:
- It will iterate over a set of x values in a certain interval with small steps.
- For each x, it computes the left side and checks if it equals 10.
- When found, it prints the solution.
- It prioritizes exact solutions, and for approximations (due to floating-point), it only considers the difference within a tiny epsilon.

```python
# Enumeration of solutions to x^2 + floor(x/2) + floor(x/3) = 10
import math

# Define the search interval based on rough estimation
# Since x^2 is dominant, check around x in [-4, 4]
min_x, max_x = -4, 4
step = 0.01
epsilon = 1e-6

x = min_x
while x <= max_x:
    val = x**2 + math.floor(x/2) + math.floor(x/3)
    # Check for exact match
    if abs(val - 10) < epsilon:
        print(f"x ≈ {x:.4f} => {val}")
    x += step
```
