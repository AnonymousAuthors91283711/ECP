The given code appears to be a snippet from Lean, a proof assistant language, involving matrices, determinants, and some unknown function `omnimath3824_answer`. The problem is to develop a Python program to enumerate possible answers relevant to the statement, supporting conjecture and proof.

Given the structure, I interpret the problem as exploring matrices of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` with entries `A[i,j] = a + |i - j| * d`. To understand determinant behavior in this family, I will generate specific small examples for small `n`, with specific values of `a` and `d` over simple ranges, and compute the determinants explicitly.

This approach helps conjecture about the closed form of the determinant in terms of `a`, `d`, and `n`. The key is to produce such determinant values for small parameters.

```python
import numpy as np

# Parameters to sample
a_values = [-1, 0, 1]
d_values = [-1, 0, 1]
n_max = 4  # Enumerate matrices up to size 5x5

# For each combination of parameters
for a in a_values:
    for d in d_values:
        for n in range(1, n_max + 1):
            size = n + 1
            # Generate the matrix
            A = np.zeros((size, size))
            for i in range(size):
                for j in range(size):
                    A[i, j] = a + abs(i - j) * d
            # Compute the determinant
            det_A = round(np.linalg.det(A))
            print(f"n={n}, a={a}, d={d}")
            print(A)
            print(f"determinant = {det_A}\n")
```

This program enumerates small matrices with various parameters, computes their determinants, and outputs each result immediately. It supports discovering patterns in the determinants across small cases, helping to form conjectures about their general formula.
