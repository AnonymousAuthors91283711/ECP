theorem olympiadbench2346 (x : ℝ) (hx : 0 < x) :
    (log x)^(log (log x)) = 10000 ↔ x ∈ olympiadbench2346_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x ≈ 20.80
x ≈ 0.05. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
Given the approximate solutions x ≈ 20.80 and x ≈ 0.05, the exact solutions correspond to solving (log x)^(log log x) = 10000. Recognizing the symmetry, these values satisfy log x = t and log t = 4. The solutions are thus x = exp(4) and x = exp(exp(4)). To express the set of solutions explicitly in Lean, we include both:

<<<{exp 4, exp (exp 4)}>>>
