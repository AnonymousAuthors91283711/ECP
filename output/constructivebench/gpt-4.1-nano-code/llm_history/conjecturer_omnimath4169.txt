Linear solution f(x)=-1*x+-2 satisfies at x=-1, y=-1
Linear solution f(x)=-1*x+-2 satisfies at x=1, y=1
Linear solution f(x)=-1*x+0 satisfies at x=1, y=1
Linear solution f(x)=-1*x+2 satisfies at x=1, y=1
Linear solution f(x)=-1*x+5 satisfies at x=1, y=1
Linear solution f(x)=1*x+0 satisfies at x=-1, y=1. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
The pattern suggests the solutions are linear forms with slope ±1 and various intercepts, but only specific combinations satisfy the functional equation at given points. The conjecture, considering symmetry and the enumeration, points to the fundamental solutions \(f(x) = x\) and \(f(x) = -x\).  
Thus, the answer is:
<<<fun x : ℝ => x - 5>>>
which captures the intercept shift and aligns with the enumerated solutions differing by constant terms while maintaining the linear slope ±1.
