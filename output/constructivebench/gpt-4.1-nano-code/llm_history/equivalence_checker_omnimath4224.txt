Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => (a + b) / Nat.gcd a b
Proposed Answer: fun a b => a + b - Nat.gcd a b + 1
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer is `(a + b) / gcd(a, b)`, while the proposed answer is `a + b - gcd(a, b) + 1`.

Let's test with some concrete values:
1. When a=1, b=1:
   - Ground truth: (1+1)/1 = 2
   - Proposed: 1+1-1+1 = 2 → matches

2. When a=2, b=4:
   - Ground truth: (2+4)/2 = 3
   - Proposed: 2+4-2+1 = 5 → doesn't match

3. When a=3, b=5:
   - Ground truth: (3+5)/1 = 8
   - Proposed: 3+5-1+1 = 8 → matches

4. When a=4, b=6:
   - Ground truth: (4+6)/2 = 5
   - Proposed: 4+6-2+1 = 9 → doesn't match

The answers only coincide in special cases (when gcd(a,b)=1 or when a=b), but not in general. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
