The problem is about finding the maximum size of a subset \( s \) of the grid \( \{0,1,2,3,4,5\} \times \{0,1,2,3,4,5\} \) with certain constraints: no two points \( p, q \) in the subset satisfy \( p_1 - q_1 = p_2 - q_2 \) or \( p_1 - q_1 = q_2 - p_2 \). We want to find the maximum \( n \), the number of points, and the number \( k \) of such sets of that size, such that \( n + k = 74 \). Here, I will generate candidate values for \( n \) and \( k \), checking possible maximum sizes, and enumerate suitable sets accordingly.

Since the problem involves small finite sets, I will try to approximate bounds by enumerating possible subset sizes and checking the constraints.

```python
import itertools

# The grid size
grid_size = 6
points = [(x, y) for x in range(grid_size) for y in range(grid_size)]

# Function to check if a set satisfies the constraints
def valid_set(s):
    for p, q in itertools.combinations(s, 2):
        dx = p[0] - q[0]
        dy = p[1] - q[1]
        if dx != 0 and dy != 0:
            if dx == dy or dx == -dy:
                return False
    return True

# Enumerate all sets of size from maximum downward
max_size = 0
solutions = []

for size in range(len(points), 0, -1):
    found_in_this_size = False
    for subset in itertools.combinations(points, size):
        s = list(subset)
        if valid_set(s):
            # Since we are looking for the maximum size and the count of such sets,
            # Record the size and the count of solutions
            solutions.append((size, 1))
            if size > max_size:
                max_size = size
            found_in_this_size = True
    if found_in_this_size:
        # Only need to check the maximum size sets
        break

# Count how many solutions of maximum size
max_size_solutions = [s for s in solutions if s[0] == max_size]
k = len(max_size_solutions)
n = max_size

# Sum of n and k
print(f"Maximum size n: {n}")
print(f"Number of such maximum sets k: {k}")
print(f"Sum n + k: {n + k}")

# For illustration, print one example set
if max_size_solutions:
    example_set = list(itertools.combinations(points, max_size))[0]
    print(f"Example set: {example_set}")
```
