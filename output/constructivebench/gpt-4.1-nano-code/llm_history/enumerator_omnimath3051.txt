# The problem defines a function f: ℕ → ℕ with specific properties:
# - f(2) = 5
# - f(3) = 7
# - For all positive m, n: f(m) + f(n) = f(m * n)
#
# The goal: determine f(12).

# Observations:
# - The functional equation resembles a multiplicative version of the Cauchy equation, but with addition.
# - Checking small cases, and using the properties, can help infer the pattern.
# - Since the problem asks for f(12), and we have values for f(2) and f(3), try to find f(4), f(6), etc.

# Approach:
# - Use the functional equation to express unknowns.
# - Enumerate small values based on known data.

# Let's implement a straightforward, targeted enumeration with the known constraints.

```python
def enumerate_f_for_f12():
    # Known: f(2)=5, f(3)=7
    # Functional: f(m)+f(n)=f(m*n), for m,n>0
    # We attempt to find consistent values to deduce f(12).
    # The key: use m=2, n=6; m=3, n=4; etc.

    results = []

    # Let's hypothesize possible f(4)
    for f4 in range(1, 20):
        # From m=2, n=4: f(2)+f(4)=f(8)
        # If f(8) is unknown, we can attempt to define it as well.
        # From m=4, n=3: f(4)+f(3)=f(12)
        # So: f(12)=f(4)+7

        f8 = 5 + f4  # from m=2,n=4
        f12 = f4 + 7  # from m=4,n=3

        # From m=2, n=6: need f(6)
        # From m=3, n=2: f(3)+f(2)=f(6)
        # f(6)=7+5=12
        f6 = 12

        # Check for consistency:
        # From m=2, n=6: f(2)+f(6)=f(12)
        # f(12)=5+12=17
        # But earlier f(12)=f(4)+7
        # So: f(4)+7=17 → f(4)=10

        if f4 == 10:
            # check other relations
            f8_check = 5 + f4  # 5+10=15
            f12_check = f4 + 7 #10+7=17

            # f(8) candidate: 15
            # f(12) candidate: 17

            # Now check f(8): from m=2, n=4: 5+10=15 → consistent
            # For m=2, n=8: 5 + 15 = f(16)
            # For m=4, n=4: 10 + 10=20 → f(16)=20
            # Check if consistent:
            f16_from_2n8 = 5 + f8_check  # 5+15=20
            f16_from_4n4 = 10 + 10      #20
            # Both give 20, consistent.

            # Similarly, from m=2, n=16:
            # f(2)+f(16)=f(32)
            # f(16) is unknown; no issue, but f(32) depends on further assumptions.

            results.append({
                'f(4)': f4,
                'f(8)': f8_check,
                'f(12)': f12_check,
                'f(16)': 20,
                'f(6)': f6,
                'f(2)': 5,
                'f(3)':7
            })
    # Output all consistent solutions
    for res in results:
        print(f"f(12) = {res['f(12)']}")
        # We prioritize exact solutions
        return res['f(12)']

# Run enumeration
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Possible value for f(12):")
    print(enumerate_f_for_f12())
```

This program systematically hypothesizes consistent values, derived from the functional equations and known values, to determine that f(12) should be 17, derived from multiple consistent pathways.
