Total measure: 0.875. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The probability that rounding the sum equals the sum of the rounds involves cases: both in [0, 0.5) or both in [0.5, 1).  
Cases in [0, 0.5): the combined area is (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25; similarly for [0.5, 1): the area also 0.25.  
Total area where the equation holds: 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5.  
Excluded regions near 0.5 contribute 0.125.  
Final measure (probability): 0.25.
