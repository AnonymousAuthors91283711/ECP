. Enumerated answers: (0, 0)
(0, 1.25)
(0.5, 0)
(-0.5, 0)
(-1.0, 1.5)
(1.5, 4.0). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ × ℝ)
The set is characterized by the solutions where either x = 0 or y = 0, and cases for specific values of x or y from the enumeration. Analyzing patterns suggests the main solutions arise from x = 0, y = 0, and specific x values with corresponding y solutions. 

The set can be expressed as the union of singleton solutions with points (0, 0), (0, 1.25), (0.5, 0), (-0.5, 0), (-1.0, 1.5), and (1.5, 4.0).
