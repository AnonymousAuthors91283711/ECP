Since a, b, c are symmetric in the given equations, and x + y + z is fixed at 2010 with the sum of pairwise products being 67, the polynomial with roots x, y, z relates to symmetric sums. The expression xyz can be computed using standard symmetric relations. Observing the pattern in typical roots, the answer is likely to be 1, considering normalization and symmetry assumptions. 

Thus, the answer is:
<<<1>>>
