The problem appears to involve solving the equation \((x - a)(x - b) = (x - c)(x - d)\) given some constraints relating \(a, b, c, d\). The key constraints are \(a + d = 2015\) and \(b + c = 2015\), with the condition \(a \neq c\). The goal is to find the set of solutions for \(x\), likely aiming to identify a particular value or form for the solutions.

To assist in conjecturing the true answer, I will generate parameter values quickly and simulate solving the equation for various small sample points. The approach will be to choose small concrete values for \(a, b, c, d\) satisfying the constraints, then solve the equation for \(x\), and output candidate solutions.

Since the question involves possibly two solutions or a particular solution, I will print all solutions for small sample parameter sets, which can help conjecture the core solutions or identify a constant solution independent of choices.

```python
# Program to verify solutions of (x - a)(x - b) = (x - c)(x - d) for sample parameters
# satisfying the constraints a + d = 2015 and b + c = 2015, with a != c

def solve_quadratic(a, b, c, d):
    # Expand (x - a)(x - b) = (x - c)(x - d)
    # x^2 - (a + b)x + ab = x^2 - (c + d)x + cd
    # Simplify:
    # (a + b - c - d)x = ab - cd
    # Since a + d = 2015 and b + c = 2015, then c = 2015 - b, d = 2015 - a
    # Replace d and c:
    # (a + b - (2015 - b) - (2015 - a))x = ab - (2015 - b)(2015 - a)

    # Simplify left side:
    # a + b - 2015 + b - 2015 + a = 2a + 2b - 4030
    numerator_coeff = 2*a + 2*b - 4030
    # Simplify right side:
    # ab - (2015 - b)(2015 - a)
    cd = (2015 - b)*(2015 - a)
    rhs = a*b - cd

    if numerator_coeff == 0:
        # Equation reduces to 0*x = rhs
        if rhs == 0:
            # All x satisfy
            return 'all'
        else:
            # No solution
            return []
    else:
        x_solution = rhs / numerator_coeff
        return [x_solution]

# Sample parameters:
# Let's pick a = 1000, b = 1015
a = 1000
b = 1015
# then c = 2015 - b = 1000, d = 2015 - a = 1015
# But this makes a = c, which is not allowed (> a != c), so pick different b
b = 1010
c = 2015 - b  # 1005
d = 2015 - a  # 1015
# Now a = 1000, b = 1010, c = 1005, d = 1015 (a != c)

solutions = solve_quadratic(a, b, c, d)
for sol in solutions:
    print(f"Sample params a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d} => x solutions: {sol}")
