. Enumerated answers: Found possible remainder: 1*X^2 + 0*X + -5. Expected Answer Type: Polynomial ℝ
Given the data for polynomial evaluations and the expected remainder form, the pattern suggests the remainder relates to the evaluations at roots of the divisor polynomial. The polynomial \(X^3 - 6X^2 + 11X - 6\) factors as \((X-1)(X-2)(X-3)\). Using interpolations, the remainder corresponds to a quadratic polynomial matching the given values. From evaluations, the interpolated polynomial is \(X^2 - 5\).
