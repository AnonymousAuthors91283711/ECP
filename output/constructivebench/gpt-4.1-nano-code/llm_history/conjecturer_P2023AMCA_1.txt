. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The current proposed answer assigns `P2023AMCA_1_answer` to a function `fun t : ℝ => 18 * t`, which has type `ℝ → ℝ`, not `ℝ`. The problem statement requires `P2023AMCA_1_answer` to be a real number (`ℝ`), not a function. The equations given are:

- \( 18 t + 12 t = 45 \) which simplifies to \( 30 t = 45 \),
- and \( 18 t = P2023AMCA_1_answer \).

From the first equation, solving for \( t \):

\[ 30 t = 45 \implies t = \frac{45}{30} = 1.5. \]

Substituting into \( 18 t \):

\[ 18 \times 1.5 = 27. \]

Therefore, the value of `P2023AMCA_1_answer` should be 27.

Final answer:
<<<27.0>>>
