This problem involves finding all positive integers \( x, y, z \) such that \( 3^x - 5^y = z^2 \). Since searching infinitely is impossible, we'll choose small parameter bounds and enumerate the solutions, focusing on small \(x, y\) and computing \(z\) to check if it's an integer (a perfect square).

We're assuming that the maximal bounds for \(x, y\) are small (e.g., up to 10). For each pair, we'll compute \(z^2 = 3^x - 5^y\) and check if \(z\) is an integer and positive.

```python
import math

# Set bounds to limit search space
max_x = 10
max_y = 10

results = set()

for x in range(1, max_x + 1):
    for y in range(1, max_y + 1):
        val = 3**x - 5**y
        if val > 0:
            z = int(math.isqrt(val))
            if z * z == val:
                print((x, y, z))
                results.add((x, y, z))
```
