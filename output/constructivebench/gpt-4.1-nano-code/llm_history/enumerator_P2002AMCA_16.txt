This problem involves calculating the probability that, given two distinct numbers `(a, b)` from `tina_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` and a number `c` from `sergio_set = {1, 2, ..., 10}`, the value `c` exceeds the sum `a + b`.  

The approach:
- Enumerate all ordered pairs `(a, b)` from `tina_set` with `a ≠ b`.
- For each such pair, count how many `c` in `sergio_set` satisfy `c > a + b`.
- Sum these favorable cases and divide by the total number of `(a, b, c)` combinations.

The total number of `(a, b)` with `a ≠ b` is `5 * 4 = 20` (since for each of 5 choices for `a`, there are 4 choices for `b` excluding `a`).  
Total `(a, b, c)` combinations are `20 * 10 = 200`.  

We compute the numerator by counting, for each `(a, b)`, how many `c > a + b`.  
Then, divide by `200` to get the probability.

```python
# Enumerate all pairs (a, b) with a != b in {1..5}
tina_set = range(1, 6)
sergio_set = range(1, 11)

total_pairs = 0
favorable_count = 0

for a in tina_set:
    for b in tina_set:
        if a != b:
            total_pairs += 1
            sum_ab = a + b
            # Count c in sergio_set with c > sum_ab
            count_c = sum(1 for c in sergio_set if c > sum_ab)
            if count_c > 0:
                print(f"Pair (a={a}, b={b}) with sum={sum_ab}: {count_c} favorable c")
            favorable_count += count_c

total_combinations = total_pairs * len(sergio_set)
probability = favorable_count / total_combinations

print(f"Favorable count: {favorable_count}")
print(f"Total combinations: {total_combinations}")
print(f"Probability: {favorable_count}/{total_combinations} = {probability}")
```
