[write_program]
This problem involves constructing or analyzing a function \(a: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}\) with specific properties related to its values at squares, certain linear bounds on the difference between consecutive terms, and injectivity. To explore possible solutions and formulate conjectures, I will write a Python program that enumerates candidate sequences \(a(n)\) for small values of \(n\), respecting the constraints as much as possible.

Key points:
- For each \(k\), check \(a(k^2) > 0\) and \(a(k^2 + k) < 0\).
- For each \(n > 0\), ensure \(|a(n+1) - a(n)| \le 2023 \sqrt{n}\).
- Ensure injectedness: \(a(i) \neq a(j)\) for \(i \neq j\).

Since enumerating all infinite sequences directly is impossible, I restrict to small \(k\) and \(n\), with small ranges for \(a(n)\) (e.g., between -10 and 10), to see patterns and possible constructions.

The code will:
- Fix small parameters.
- Generate candidate sequences.
- Check constraints.
- Print viable solutions for inspection.

```python
import math
from itertools import product

# Define the bounds for n to enumerate
max_n = 20
# Range of possible a(n) values for small n
value_range = range(-10, 11)

# Generate candidate sequences for n from 1 to max_n
# To reduce combinatorial explosion, fix some initial sequence and extend
# We'll test all sequences of length max_n within the value range

def check_constraints(seq):
    # seq is list of a(n) for n=1..max_n
    for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(max_n))+1):
        sq = k*k
        if sq <= max_n:
            a_sq = seq[sq -1]
            if not (a_sq > 0):
                return False
        # Check for a(k^2 + k)
        index = sq + k
        if index <= max_n:
            a_idx = seq[index -1]
            if not (a_idx < 0):
                return False
    # Check difference bounds for all n
    for i in range(max_n -1):
        diff = abs(seq[i+1] - seq[i])
        if diff > 2023 * math.sqrt(i+1):
            return False
    # Check injectivity
    if len(seq) != len(set(seq)):
        return False
    return True

# Enumerate candidate sequences
count = 0
for candidate in product(value_range, repeat=max_n):
    if check_constraints(candidate):
        print("Candidate sequence (n=1..20):", candidate)
        count +=1

print(f"Total candidate sequences found: {count}")
```
