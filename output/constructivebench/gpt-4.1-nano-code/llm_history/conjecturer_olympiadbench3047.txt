    logb 2 (sqrt x) = olympiadbench3047_answer x := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Sample x: 1024.0000000000014
log_b(sqrt(x)): 5.000000000000002
Base b=2 -> log_b(sqrt(x))=5.000000000000002
Base b=3 -> log_b(sqrt(x))=3.154648767857288
Base b=4 -> log_b(sqrt(x))=2.500000000000001. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
The pattern: when log_b(sqrt(x)) with base 2 is about 5, and log_b(b^k)=k, then sqrt(x) ≈ 2^5=32, so x≈(32)^2=1024. The enumerated answer aligns with 1024, and the simplified pattern suggests that for base 2, log_b(sqrt(x)) equals 5. Therefore, the general formula relates log_b(sqrt(x)) to log_b(x) divided by 2. 

Since log_b (sqrt(x)) = (1/2) log_b x, and log_b x = 20 by hypothesis, the answer is 20/2 = 10.

<<<fun x => 10>>>
