[write_program]
The problem describes a complex combinatorial and geometric setup involving points on a circle (or a modular structure), sets with specific symmetry and distance properties, and certain parity conditions on distances. It asks for the greatest integer \(k\) such that certain configurations exist. Enumerating all such configurations explicitly over the finite set \(\{0, 1, \ldots, 2005\}\) (since 2006 points, zero-based) is computationally intensive but feasible with small parameters or by seeking extremal values.

To obey the constraints:
- We focus on small sample values to set an upper bound.
- We generate candidate sets \(d\) and \(t\) with limited size.
- We check the properties iteratively.
- We print each candidate configuration found, immediately.

Given the constraints, the effective approach is to generate all possible \(d\) of size â‰¤ 2003 with the specified properties, and for each low-size \(t\). But since \(d\) must have cardinality 2003, and the total points are 2006, we consider similar smaller subsets to find an extremal candidate.

Below is a Python script that:
- Enumerates small candidate \(d\) and \(t\) sets considering the constraints.
- Checks the parity and distance conditions.
- Keeps track of the maximum \(k\).

This is a heuristic to approximate the potential maximum, respecting the problem's complexity and the token limit.
