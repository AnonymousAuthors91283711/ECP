The problem involves summing the number of digit transitions for base-2 representations of numbers from 0 to 4095, then dividing by 4096. To assist in conjecture and proof, I'll write a Python script that enumerates the sum of transitions over all numbers, prints intermediate results immediately, and seeks an insight into the average number of transitions per number.

In binary, the digit transitions for all numbers from 0 to 4095 (which is 2^12 - 1) can be summarized as follows: Since the range covers all 12-bit numbers, the total transitions sum can be analyzed combinatorially via bit patterns.

The program will:
- Generate binary representations for numbers in range.
- Count transitions for each.
- Sum all transitions.
- Print each intermediate count.
- Calculate the average.

No hardcoded answer; runs efficiently and streams results.

```python
# Enumerates binary representations of numbers from 0 to 4095 (12-bit) and counts total digit transitions.
def count_transitions(bin_str):
    return sum(1 for a, b in zip(bin_str, bin_str[1:]) if a != b)

total_transitions = 0
for n in range(4096):
    bin_str = format(n, '012b')  # 12-bit binary representation
    transitions = count_transitions(bin_str)
    print(f'Number: {n}, binary: {bin_str}, transitions: {transitions}')
    total_transitions += transitions

average_transitions = total_transitions / 4096
print(f'Total transitions: {total_transitions}')
print(f'Average transitions per number: {average_transitions}')
```
