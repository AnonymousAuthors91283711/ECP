This problem involves analyzing the set of natural numbers \( n \) such that \( 0 < n \) and a given inequality involving \(\log_{10} n\). The key parts are:

- The variable \( \log_{10} n \), which we'll denote as \( x \).
- The inequality: \( 0 \le \frac{2x - x^2}{x - 3} \).
- The condition \( x \neq 3 \).

Our plan:

- Explore the behavior of the inequality \( \frac{2x - x^2}{x - 3} \ge 0 \).
- Find the critical points and test intervals.
- For each relevant \( n \), compute \( x = \log_{10} n \), check if it satisfies the inequality.
- Convert back to \( n = 10^{x} \) for candidates. Since \( n \in \mathbb{N} \), focus on integers near the critical points.

Let's write a Python script that:

- Enumerates \( n \) from 1 to some reasonable upper limit (e.g., 10,000).
- Converts \( n \) to \( x = \log_{10} n \).
- Checks the inequality \( (2x - x^2) / (x -3) \ge 0 \) for each.
- Excludes \( x = 3 \) explicitly.
- Collects the \( n \)'s satisfying the conditions and prints them immediately.

This will help us conjecture the pattern and boundary behavior.

```python
import math

# Define the maximum range for n
max_n = 10000

# List to store qualifying n
results = []

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    x = math.log10(n)
    # Exclude the point x=3 (n=10^3=1000)
    if abs(x - 3) < 1e-9:
        continue
    denominator = x - 3
    numerator = 2 * x - x ** 2
    # Check the inequality 0 â‰¤ (2x - x^2) / (x - 3)
    if denominator != 0 and numerator / denominator >= 0:
        # Store the integer n
        print(n)
        results.append(n)
```
