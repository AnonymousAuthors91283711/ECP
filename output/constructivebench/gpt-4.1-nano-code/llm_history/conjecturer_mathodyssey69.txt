The given condition involves complex numbers with unit norm and their conjugate products. The numeric hint points towards the cosine of the angle between unit vectors: cos θ = √3/2. Hence, the angle θ ≈ 30°, and ‖a - b‖ = 2 sin(θ/2) ≈ 2 sin(15°). Calculating sin(15°) = (√6 - √2)/4 ≈ 0.2588, then double gives approximately 0.5176.
