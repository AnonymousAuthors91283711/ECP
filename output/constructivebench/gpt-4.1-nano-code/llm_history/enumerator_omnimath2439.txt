The problem involves a finite set of functions from Fin 101 to Fin 101 satisfying a specific property involving the 101st iterate. The goal is to compute the number \( N \) of such functions \( f \) where \( f^{101} \) applied to 1 gives 2, modulo 103. 

This is a combinatorial problem involving permutations and functions with fixed points, and the main complexity is counting the number of functions \(f\) where \(f^{101}(1) = 2\). By analyzing the problem, it relates to the cycles in the permutation of the set \(\{0, 1, \ldots, 100\}\). 

The key observations:
- The condition involves the 101st iterate, so the cycle length of 1 and 2 in \(f\) matter.
- For \(f^{101}(1) = 2\), it suggests the cycle containing 1 must include 2, and the cycle length divides 101 (which is prime).  
- For a cycle of length dividing 101, the cycle length is either 1 or 101. Since 1 and 2 are in the same cycle, the cycle length must be 101 (since length 1 implies \(f(1)=1\), but then \(f^{101}(1)=1 \neq 2\)). So, 1 and 2 are part of the same 101-length cycle.

Thus the problem reduces to counting permutations of \(\{0, \ldots, 100\}\) where 1 and 2 are in an 101-cycle and the remaining elements form any permutation of the remaining 98 elements, with the 101-cycle containing 1 and 2, and the rest free.

Now, I will implement a Python code that enumerates such permutations by counting valid cycles and the arrangements of the other elements, computing \( N \), and then taking the result modulo 103.

```python
# Enumerate the number of functions f: {0,...,100} -> {0,...,100}
# such that f^{101}(1) = 2, with f fixedpoints and cycle structures
# where 1 and 2 are in the same cycle of length dividing 101 (must be 101).

from math import factorial

# Total elements
n = 101

# Number of elements excluding 1 and 2
remaining = n - 2  # 99 elements

# Since 1 and 2 must be in a cycle of length 101 (divides 101),
# and 101 is prime, the cycle length is exactly 101.

# Number of arrangements:
# - Fix 1 and 2 in an 101-length cycle, which is (n-1)! but with 1 and 2 fixed in the cycle,
#   the number of such cycles that include 1 and 2 is (n-2)! because fixing 1 and 2 reduces rotations.
# - The remaining elements (excluding 1 and 2) can be arranged arbitrarily,
#   i.e., permuted in any way (remaining factorial).

# Number of permutations with 1 and 2 in the same cycle of length 101:
# Each2 such cycle corresponds to placing 1 and 2 in a cycle with the remaining 99 elements.
# Number of such cycles: (remaining)! = factorial(99)

# The other elements (excluding 1 and 2) can be assigned independently:
# The total number of permutations where 1 and 2 are in a cycle of length 101:
# is factorial(99)

# For f^{101}(1)=2, the cycle containing 1 must contain 2
# which means 1 and 2 are in an 101-cycle containing all elements.

# Number of such functions:
# Since only one cycle includes 1 and 2 of length 101, and the rest arbitrary,
# total is the number of 101-cycles that contain 1 and 2 times permutations of the other elements:

count = factorial(99)

print(chr(10).join(str(count // 1)))  # Streaming results

# Output the count modulo 103
print(count % 103)
```
