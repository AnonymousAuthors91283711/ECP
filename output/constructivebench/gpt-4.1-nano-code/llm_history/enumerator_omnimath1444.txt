The problem involves computing the value of a specific expression involving powers of 2003, 2004, and 2005, notably:

floor(((2005^3) / (2003 * 2004)) - ((2003^3) / (2004 * 2005)))

To assist in conjecturing, I will evaluate these fractions precisely and attempt to find the integer part of their difference. Since the expression involves large numbers, I will avoid floating-point errors by computing directly with integers where possible. The goal is to determine the exact floor value.

The approach:
- Compute 2005^3, 2003^3 directly as integers.
- Compute denominators: 2003*2004 and 2004*2005.
- Calculate the fractions, subtract, and find the floor.

Given the symmetry, the key is to check whether the difference is just slightly less than an integer, very close to an integer, or well away from one. I'll enumerate the exact calculation steps with large integers to determine the value.

```python
# Python code to evaluate the expression and find its floor
# without approximation errors.

# Define the numbers
a = 2003
b = 2004
c = 2005

# Compute cubes
a_cubed = a ** 3
b_cubed = b ** 3
c_cubed = c ** 3

# Compute denominators
denom1 = a * b
denom2 = b * c

# Calculate the fractions as floats with high precision
frac1_num = c_cubed * 1  # numerator for c^3 / (a * b)
frac2_num = a_cubed * 1  # numerator for a^3 / (b * c)

# To avoid floating errors, compute numerator differences
# Cross-multiplied to compare numerator values directly
# difference = c^3 / (a * b) - a^3 / (b * c)
# = (c^3 * c * c) / (a * b * c) - (a^3 * a * a) / (a * a * b)
# Actually, better to compute actual fractions:
value1_num = c_cubed * c  # numerator of first fraction scaled to common denominator
value2_num = a_cubed * a

# But given the denominators, let's do the following:
# numerator of the difference:
diff_num = c_cubed * denom2 - a_cubed * denom1

# denominator is denom1 * denom2
denominator = denom1 * denom2

# The value of the difference
difference = diff_num / denominator

# Take the floor
import math
floor_value = math.floor(difference)
print(floor_value)
```
