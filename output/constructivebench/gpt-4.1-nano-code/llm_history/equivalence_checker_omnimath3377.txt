Ground Truth Answer: X^4 - 2*X^3 - 13*X^2 + 14*X + 24
Proposed Answer: 24*(X + 3)*(X + 1)*(X - 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding a polynomial relationship between P and Q, where Q is constructed from squares of P's roots.

2. The ground truth answer is a quartic polynomial in standard form.

3. The proposed answer is a factored form of a cubic polynomial (degree 3 when expanded), multiplied by 24.

Key observations:
- The degrees don't match (ground truth is degree 4, proposed is degree 3 when expanded)
- The proposed answer cannot represent the same polynomial as the ground truth because they have different degrees
- The roots suggested in the proposed answer (-3, -1, 2) don't match the roots of the ground truth polynomial
