Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {(a, b) | (a = 1 ∧ b = 1006) ∨ (a = 3 ∧ b = 331) ∨ (a = 11 ∧ b = 31)}
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in Lean), we cannot verify whether the proposed answer matches it. The proposed answer provides three specific solution pairs, but without knowing the intended ground truth, we cannot determine equivalence.
