This problem involves solving the equation \(x^n - x^{n-2} - x + 2 = 0\) with the condition \(|x|=1\). We want to parameterize solutions \(x\) on the unit circle (i.e., \(x = e^{i\theta}\)) for small sample \(n\) and enumerate solutions numerically to conjecture or prove the structure of solutions.

Since \(x = e^{i\theta}\), we can test specific \(\theta\) values for small \(n\), and identify solutions that satisfy the equation within a tolerance. We'll also print when solutions are found, streaming results. To cover different angles efficiently, we'll sample \(\theta\) from 0 to \(2\pi\).

```python
import cmath
import math

# Define parameters
n_values = [2, 3, 4, 5]  # small sample n
delta = 1e-6  # tolerance for solution
num_samples = 1000  # number of theta samples

for n in n_values:
    print(f"Sampling solutions for n = {n}")
    solutions = set()
    for j in range(num_samples):
        theta = 2 * math.pi * j / num_samples
        x = cmath.exp(1j * theta)
        # Compute the LHS of the equation
        val = x ** n - x ** (n - 2) - x + 2
        if abs(val) < delta:
            # Avoid duplicates close to each other
            real_part = round(x.real, 8)
            imag_part = round(x.imag, 8)
            key = (real_part, imag_part)
            if key not in solutions:
                solutions.add(key)
                print(f"Found solution: x = {x} (theta â‰ˆ {theta:.3f} radians)")
```
