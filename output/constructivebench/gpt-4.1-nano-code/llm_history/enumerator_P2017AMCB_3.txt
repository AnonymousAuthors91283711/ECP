The problem appears to be a mathematical problem from 2017, involving real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), and a condition involving a rational expression equaling \(-2\). The goal is likely to find the value of \(\frac{x + 3y}{3x - y}\) under the given condition. To assist with conjecturing and verifying, I will generate relevant candidate solutions systematically, focusing especially on exploring the implicit relationship between \( x \) and \( y \). 

Since the problem involves the relation \((3x + y)/(x - 3y) = -2\), first we solve this directly to find \( y \) in terms of \( x \), then compute the corresponding value of the other expression. I'll generate sample solutions for \( x \) within a small range and compute the consequent \( y \), then evaluate the second expression. The goal is to either confirm the conjectured answer or identify the pattern.

```python
# Generate candidate solutions for x and compute corresponding y
# based on the given condition, then evaluate the second expression.
# Focus on exact rational relations and small sample points for clarity.

# List to hold findings
answers = set()

for x_int in range(-10, 11):  # small integer samples
    if x_int != 0:
        # Solve (3x + y)/(x - 3y) = -2 for y
        # Cross-multiplied: 3x + y = -2(x - 3y)
        # 3x + y = -2x + 6y
        # combine like terms: 3x + 2x = 6y - y
        # 5x = 5y
        # y = x
        y = x_int

        # Compute the second expression
        numerator = x_int + 3 * y
        denominator = 3 * x_int - y
        if denominator != 0:
            answer = numerator / denominator
            print(answer)
            answers.add(answer)

# Based on the algebra, the answer simplifies to -1 when y = x
# Let's verify this directly:
# numerator = x + 3x = 4x
# denominator = 3x - x = 2x
# ratio = 4x / 2x = 2  for x â‰  0
# So answers should all be 2.

# Let's check the calculations more generally
# For the relation y = x, evaluate the second expression:
# (x + 3x)/(3x - x) = 4x / 2x = 2

# Final answer:
# The value is always 2 under the given condition.

# Output the identified answer:
print("Final conjectured answer is 2.")
