This problem models handshakes in a social setting represented by a complete graph where some edges are missing or have special properties (like "edges" and "others"). To help conjecture and verify the true answer related to `k`, we enumerate plausible small values of `n` and check for the conditions given. Since `T` is fixed at 8 and the total handshakes are given as `20 * T = 160`, our goal is to find all integer solutions for `n` and `k` satisfying the formulas.

The key parts:
- total handshakes: 160
- complete graph handshakes: n(n-1)/2
- "others_handshakes" = complete_graph_handshakes - (n - 1)
- `k` equals the total handshakes minus "others_handshakes."
- The condition: `ed_handshakes` < n - 1, i.e., `k < n - 1`.

Our enumeration will:
- Loop over small `n` values where the total handshakes don't exceed 160.
- Calculate `k` based on the formulas.
- Check the inequality `k < n - 1`.

```python
# Enumerate small values of n, compute corresponding k, and check conditions
# to help conjecture the true value of k in the given context.

max_n = 20  # arbitrary small upper bound for enumeration
fixed_total_handshakes = 160  # since T=8, total handshakes = 8*20=160

for n in range(2, max_n + 1):
    complete_graph_handshakes = n * (n - 1) // 2
    others_handshakes = complete_graph_handshakes - (n - 1)
    k = fixed_total_handshakes - others_handshakes
    # Check if k is non-negative and less than n - 1
    if 0 <= k < n - 1:
        print(f"n={n}, k={k}")
```
