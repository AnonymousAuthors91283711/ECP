abbrev omnimath2778_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2778 : 
  {k : ℝ | ∃! x, x^2 + 2*k*x + 7*k - 10 = 0} = {5, 2} ∧ 
  (5 : ℝ) + 2 = omnimath2778_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: k=2 yields one solution x=-2.0
Candidate for special case k=2: x=-2.0
k=5 yields one solution x=-5.0
Candidate for special case k=5: x=-5.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<5>>>

The only k values with a unique solution to x^2 + 2kx + 7k - 10 = 0 are 2 and 5; their sum is 7, with the answer being 5.
