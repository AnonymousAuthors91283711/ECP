This problem appears to involve summing the reciprocals of certain natural numbers n, constrained by conditions involving divisibility and the totient function φ n. The goal seems to be to compute (or estimate) the sum over all such n, then identify the exact value of the sum.

Given the complexity and the abstract conditions, we will:
- Sample small values of n.
- Select small n such that 0 < n, (2 * n) divides φ n, and (n : ℚ) is the natural number n as a rational.
- Compute the sum over these n, and check for potential divergence or convergence.
- Stream answers as we find candidates.

Because the problem involves a divisibility condition linking φ n and 2 n, and the set is defined over all n satisfying these conditions, we will limit the search to small n to identify a pattern or possible sum.

Let's implement a code that:
- Enumerates n up to a small limit.
- Checks if (2*n) divides φ n.
- Adds 1/n to the sum if conditions hold.
- Prints each candidate n and partial sum.

This will help in conjecturing the overall sum.

```python
import math

# Euler's totient function
def phi(n):
    result = n
    p = 2
    while p * p <= n:
        if n % p == 0:
            while n % p == 0:
                n //= p
            result -= result // p
        p += 1 if p == 2 else 2
    if n > 1:
        result -= result // n
    return result

# Enumerate n up to a small limit to discover the sum
limit = 100
total_sum = 0.0
for n in range(1, limit + 1):
    tot = phi(n)
    if (2 * n) != 0 and tot % (2 * n) == 0:
        answer = 1 / n
        total_sum += answer
        print(f"n = {n}, phi(n) = {tot}, sum += {answer:.4f}, total sum = {total_sum:.4f}")
```
[refine_program]
The problem involves summing over certain values of n where the condition `(2 * n) divides phi(n)` holds, and then computing the sum of `1/n`. The Python code enumerates all n up to 100 to find such n's, summing 1/n for each, and printing info during the process. 

However, the code's condition `(2 * n) != 0 and tot % (2 * n) == 0` is problematic: 
- `(2 * n) != 0` is always true for n ≥ 1, so unnecessary.
- The core condition is `(2 * n) divides phi(n)`; since 2 * n > 0, the modulo check is fine.
- But `phi(n)` for small n rarely has factors related to 2 * n, because typically `phi(n)` is less than n. For the sum to be non-empty, such n must satisfy the divisibility condition.

Given the comment "Error: Program outputs empty result" and no printed values, it suggests no n ≤ 100 satisfies the divisibility condition, possibly because the code's logic is incompatible with the mathematical property being studied.

### Judgement:

1. The sum should involve only those `n` where `(2 * n)` divides `phi(n)`. If none exist for `n ≤ 100`, then the sum is zero.
2. The formula is summing `1/n` over such n.
3. The problem asks to compute the total sum, likely a finite sum.

**Since the code enumerates only up to `n=100`, and finds no such n, the sum is zero.** The original code is correct but perhaps the range is too small. Because the sample indicates the sum is empty, the sum should be zero, and the answer is zero. 

---

### Is the code correct? 

The code's approach makes sense, but perhaps the problem expects summing over an actual range where such n exists, or a different limit.

**Given the problem statement and the fact that the enumeration returns no result, the sum is zero.** This matches the output of code if extended to larger n; in our view, for the small n range, it's correct that the sum is zero.

---

### Final decision: 

**Accept if the code correctly enumerates the sum, even if empty;** since the problem involves detecting whether the sum is zero or not.

[refine_program]
The problem involves a sum over a set of natural numbers with specific properties related to Euler's totient function φ(n). The original program is empty and produces no outputs, which clearly does not meet the requirements. 

Given the instructions, we should:
- Use parameters small enough to enumerate easily.
- For a sum involving φ(n), choose small n values and check the set condition.
- Compute the sum over these small candidates.
- Output the sum explicitly when it gets close to the true value.
- As the problem asks for the sum over {n | 0 < n, 2*n | φ(n)}, we'll identify small n satisfying 2*n | φ(n), sum over 1/n for these, and then output the result.

Since the true answer isn't known, we won't hardcode it. We should:
- Fix a small upper bound for n, say n ≤ 20.
- Enumerate n for which 0 < n ≤ 20 and check if 2 * n divides φ(n).
- Sum 1/n over those n.
- Output the partial sum after enumeration, then the final sum.

Max 400 tokens constraint is easy to satisfy. Let's implement that now.

```python
# Python program to enumerate small n satisfying 2*n divides φ(n),
# sum 1/n over these, and output the sum.
import math

def phi(n):
    # Compute Euler's totient function
    count = 0
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        if math.gcd(n, k) == 1:
            count += 1
    return count

# Set the upper limit for enumeration
max_n = 20
total_sum = 0.0

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    tot = phi(n)
    if tot % (2 * n) == 0:
        total_sum += 1 / n
        print(f"n={n}, φ(n)={tot}, partial sum={total_sum}")

# After enumeration, output the total sum
print(f"Total sum over small n: {total_sum}")
```
