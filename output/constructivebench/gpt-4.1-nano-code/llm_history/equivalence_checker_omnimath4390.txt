Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {(x, y, z) | z = x - y ∨ z = y - x}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer captures many solutions where z = x - y or z = y - x, which indeed satisfy the original equations when substituted. However, it's not complete as there might be other solutions (like when x = y = z = 0) that aren't covered by just these two cases. The "Close" rating indicates the proposed answer is partially correct but not exhaustive.
