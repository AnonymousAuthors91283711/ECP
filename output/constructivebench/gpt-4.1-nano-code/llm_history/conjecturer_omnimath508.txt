. Enumerated answers: x = 40, value = 1681 (composite). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem asks for the least x > 0 such that x^2 + x + 41 is composite. Among small x, x=40 yields 1681, which is composite (41^2). This is known as the largest x before the polynomial hits a prime.

Therefore, the minimal such x is 40, and the composite value is 1681.

<<<40>>>
