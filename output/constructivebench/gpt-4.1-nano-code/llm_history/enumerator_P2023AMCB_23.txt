The problem involves finding the least natural number n such that the size of a certain image set equals 936. Specifically, for functions d from Fin n to Fin 6, we consider the product of (d(i).val + 1) over all i, and look at the set of all such products as d varies across all functions from Fin n to Fin 6.

To enumerate all possible values that can produce the product, note that each (d(i).val + 1) takes values from 1 to 6 (since d(i).val âˆˆ [0..5]). The total number of functions is 6^n, and the image consists of all unique products formed by choosing (d(i).val + 1) for each i, allowing repetitions.

We aim to find the smallest n such that the number of distinct products equals 936.

Key observations:
- For small n, compute the number of distinct products formed by all sequences of length n with elements in {1..6}.
- To get exactly 936 products, we test increasing n until we find the one where the count matches 936.

Because the elements are small, we can generate all possible products for each n and count unique cases efficiently.

```python
# This program searches for the smallest n where the number of unique products
# formed by sequences of length n with elements from 1 to 6 matches 936.
# It enumerates all products for each n by generating all functions from Fin n to Fin 6,
# computes the products, and counts distinct results.

def count_unique_products(n):
    from itertools import product
    values = range(1, 7)  # Corresponds to (d i).val + 1 in [1..6]
    products_set = set()

    # Generate all sequences of length n with elements from values
    for seq in product(values, repeat=n):
        prod = 1
        for v in seq:
            prod *= v
        products_set.add(prod)
    return len(products_set)

target = 936
n = 1
max_n = 10  # set an upper bound for search
while n <= max_n:
    count = count_unique_products(n)
    print(f"n={n}: {count}")
    if count == target:
        print(f"Found n with exactly {target} products: n={n}")
        break
    n += 1
```
