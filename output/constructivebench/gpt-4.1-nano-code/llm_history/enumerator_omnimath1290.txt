The problem appears to involve summing over all permutations of a finite set, considering their cycle types, and determining a numeric answer. To assist in conjecturing, I will enumerate different permutations of Fin 7, analyze their cycle types, and compute the sum as described. Since the original code uses Lean and mathlib, the Python program will imitate the logic: it will generate permutations, determine their cycle types, and sum the specified expression.

Due to the combinatorial nature and the original summation involving cycle types, I will generate all permutations of size 7 but only partially, filtering for specific cycle types or counts to manage efficiency. I'll print each candidate sum as itâ€™s computed.

```python
import itertools
import math

# Generate all permutations of {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
elements = list(range(7))
total_permutations = list(itertools.permutations(elements))

# Function to count cycle type from a permutation
def cycle_type(perm):
    visited = [False]*7
    cycle_counts = []
    for i in range(7):
        if not visited[i]:
            count = 0
            current = i
            while not visited[current]:
                visited[current] = True
                current = perm[current]
                count += 1
            cycle_counts.append(count)
    return sorted(cycle_counts, reverse=True)

result_sum = 0

for perm in total_permutations:
    # Count the sum of cycle type parts
    ctype = cycle_type(perm)
    cycle_sum = sum(ctype)
    # Compute the term: (7 - cycle_sum)
    term = 7 - cycle_sum
    result_sum += term
    # Print each partial sum immediately
    print(f"Permutation: {perm}, cycle type: {ctype}, term: {term}")

print(f"Total sum over all permutations: {result_sum}")
```
