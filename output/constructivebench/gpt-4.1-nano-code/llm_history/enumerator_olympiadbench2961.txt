This problem involves finding the greatest value of a particular quadratic expression over all pairs (A, B) of distinct elements from a finite set (specifically, A and B are elements of Fin 7, i.e., integers from 0 to 6). The expression is n = A * 7^2 + B * 7 + A, which simplifies to n = A * 49 + B * 7 + A = (A + 1) * 49 + B * 7, but to be thorough, we will iterate over all possible pairs (A, B), where A ≠ B, and compute n for each pair. The goal is to find the maximum value among these, and output all candidates as we find their values.

```python
# Iterate over all pairs (A, B) with A and B in 0..6, where A ≠ B
# For each pair, compute n = A * 49 + B * 7 + A
# Track and print each candidate, and finally output the greatest found value

max_value = -1
answers = []

for A in range(7):
    for B in range(7):
        if A != B:
            n = A * 49 + B * 7 + A
            print(f"Candidate with A={A}, B={B} => n={n}")
            if n > max_value:
                max_value = n
                answers = [n]

# After enumerating all, report the maximum value found
print(f"The greatest n is: {max_value}")
```
