      {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (214 * n).divisors.card = (2014 * n).divisors.card}
      olympiadbench2603_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=53371: divisor count of 214*n = 24, 2014*n = 24
n=19133: divisor count of 214*n = 24, 2014*n = 24. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The only consistent pattern implies the minimal n where the divisor counts of 214*n and 2014*n are equal, observed at 53371 and 19133. The minimal such n is 19133.
