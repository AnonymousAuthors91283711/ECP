Since q is defined as the sum over k from 1 to p-1 of x^k, with coefficients involving quadratic residues mod p (by Fermat's little theorem), the maximum n with (X - 1)^n dividing q is p - 1, because q is essentially the sum of all monomials \( x^k \) except for possibly x^0, which isn't in the sum. 

Thus, the answer is p - 1.
