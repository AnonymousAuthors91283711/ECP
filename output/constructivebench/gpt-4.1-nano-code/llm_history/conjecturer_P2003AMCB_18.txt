abbrev P2003AMCB_18_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2003AMCB_18 :
  IsLeast {x : ℕ | 0 < x ∧ ∃ y : ℕ, 0 < y ∧ 7 * x^5 = 11 * y^13} P2003AMCB_18_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No solutions found for y in range up to 1000.
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The enumeration indicates no solutions within the specified bounds, suggesting the set is empty and the answer is zero.
