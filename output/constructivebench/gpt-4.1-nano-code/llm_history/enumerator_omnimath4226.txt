The problem asks us to determine the value of the expression \(w(w + x)(w + y)(w + z)\) given that the sum of four real numbers \(x + y + z + w = 0\) and the sum of their seventh powers \(x^7 + y^7 + z^7 + w^7 = 0\). 

Since the problem doesn't provide explicit solutions, one natural approach is to consider symmetric cases where the variables are structured to satisfy the given conditions. For example, if \(x=y=z=-w\), then the sum \(x + y + z + w\) is zero, and the seventh powers sum to zero as well. Testing this symmetric case helps conjecture the value of the expression.

Let's analyze the symmetric case \(x = y = z = -w\):

- The sum condition:
\[ x + y + z + w = 3(-w) + w = -3w + w = -2w \]
For this to be zero, \(w = 0\). Then \(x=y=z=0\) as well, leading to the trivial case where all variables are zero.

In this case,
\[w(w + x)(w + y)(w + z) = 0 \times (0 + 0)^3 = 0\].

Alternatively, suppose we pick other configurations where the sum and sum of seventh powers are zero. For simplicity and because the conditions are symmetric, the expression evaluating to zero is a strong candidate.

Based on this reasoning, I hypothesize the answer to be zero. We'll programmatically test several values satisfying the conditions to verify.

```python
# Enumerate some small sample solutions satisfying the conditions
# x + y + z + w = 0 and x^7 + y^7 + z^7 + w^7 = 0
# and compute w*(w + x)*(w + y)*(w + z)

# Generate candidate quadruples with some symmetries
samples = []

# Symmetric solutions: set w = - (x + y + z), test small values
for x in [-1, 0, 1]:
    for y in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for z in [-1, 0, 1]:
            w = -(x + y + z)
            # Compute sum of seventh powers
            sum_pow = x**7 + y**7 + z**7 + w**7
            # Check if close to zero (tolerance)
            if abs(sum_pow) < 1e-9:
                value = w * (w + x) * (w + y) * (w + z)
                print(f'x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, w={w}, value={value}')
                samples.append(value)

# If no deviations, likely zero is the answer
# Else, analyze sampled values
```
