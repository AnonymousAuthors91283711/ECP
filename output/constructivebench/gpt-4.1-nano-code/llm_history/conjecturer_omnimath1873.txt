. Enumerated answers: n=1, sum=2, a={(1, 0): 1, (1, 1): 1}
n=2, sum=2, a={(2, 0): 1, (2, 1): 0, (2, 2): 1}. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The pattern suggests the sum over k of a n k equals 2, with boundary conditions where a n 0 = a n n = 1 and recursive relations resembling binomial differences. Considering the initial examples, the pattern resembles the sum of binomial coefficients, leading to the conclusion that the sum consistently equals 2 regardless of n.
