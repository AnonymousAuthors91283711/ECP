  logb 4 x + logb 8 (y * z) = 2 ∧
  logb 4 y + logb 8 (x * z) = 4 ∧

The pattern suggests symmetric relationships among log expressions, hinting at the geometric mean of x, y, z in powers of 2. Analyzing the given equations, the combined sum suggests that x * y * z equals 2 raised to the sum of the individual k-values derived from those equations, leading to the conclusion that the product equals 2 raised to 8, i.e., 2^8.
