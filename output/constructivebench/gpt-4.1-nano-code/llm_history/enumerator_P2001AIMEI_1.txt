The problem involves summing integers k between 10 and 99 where every digit d of k is nonzero and divides k exactly. To enumerate possible values, I will generate all two-digit numbers, filter those with nonzero digits that each divide the number, then sum them up. The code will print each qualifying number as it is found, and then compute and display their total sum.

```python
# Enumerate two-digit numbers from 10 to 99
results = []
total_sum = 0

for k in range(10, 100):
    digits = [int(d) for d in str(k)]
    # Check if all digits are nonzero and divide k
    if all(d != 0 and k % d == 0 for d in digits):
        print(k)  # Stream the answer when found
        results.append(k)
        total_sum += k

print("Total sum:", total_sum)
```
