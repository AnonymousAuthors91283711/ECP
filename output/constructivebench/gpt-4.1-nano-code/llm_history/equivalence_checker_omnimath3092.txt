Ground Truth Answer: 16
Proposed Answer: 3 * 2 + 2 * 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. From the first equation 3 + t = 5, we get t = 2
2. From the second equation t + s = 7 (with t=2), we get s = 5
3. Now calculate t + t + t + s + s = 2 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 5 = 16

The ground truth answer is indeed 16.

The proposed answer is 3 * 2 + 2 * 5 = 6 + 10 = 16.

Both answers evaluate to the same value (16), though they are expressed differently. The proposed answer is essentially showing the calculation broken down as (3*t) + (2*s) = (3*2) + (2*5) = 16, which is equivalent to the ground truth.
