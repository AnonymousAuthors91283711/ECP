The problem appears to involve calculating the number of trailing zeros in the factorial product of numbers from 1 to 100! and then finding the value modulo 1000. Since `padicValNat 5 factorial_product` computes the number of trailing zeros of the product, we need to analyze the sum of zeros contributed by each factorial in the product.

The expression `‚àè k in Finset.Icc 1 100, k!` can be rewritten as the product of factorials from 1! to 100!. The total number of trailing zeros of this large product is the sum of the number of zeros of each factorial, i.e.:

\[ \sum_{k=1}^{100} \text{zeros}(k!) \]

and then we want this sum modulo 1000.

The number of zeros in \(k!\) is:

\[ \text{zeros}(k!) = \left\lfloor \frac{k}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{k}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{k}{125} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{k}{625} \right\rfloor + \left\rfloor \frac{k}{3125} \right\rfloor + \dots \]

Since \(k \leq 100\), only up to \(\lfloor k/25 \rfloor\)  and \(\lfloor k/125 \rfloor\) terms will matter because higher powers exceed 100.

Implementation:
- Sum `zeros(k!)` for `k` in `1..100`.
- Compute sum modulo 1000.
- Output the sum.

```python
# Compute the total number of trailing zeros in the product of factorials from 1! to 100!
total_zeros = 0
for k in range(1, 101):
    count = 0
    divisor = 5
    while divisor <= k:
        count += k // divisor
        divisor *= 5
    total_zeros += count

# Output the total zeros modulo 1000
print(total_zeros % 1000)
```
