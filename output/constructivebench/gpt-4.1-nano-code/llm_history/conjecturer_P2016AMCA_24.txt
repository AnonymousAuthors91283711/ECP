theorem P2016AMCA_24 :
  IsLeast {a : ℝ | 0 < a ∧ ∃ (b : ℝ), 0 < b ∧ ∀ (x : ℝ), 
    eval x (X^3 - C a * X^2 + C b * X - C a) = 0} 3 ∧

    b = P2016AMCA_24_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: a: 0.010, b: 0.197














. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<0.197>>>

The answer for `b` converges with the pattern seen in enumerated solutions and the structure of the polynomial roots; it appears to be approximately 0.197.
