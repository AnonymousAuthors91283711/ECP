This problem involves a set-theoretic and measure-theoretic optimization over configurations of points in the unit square. The key steps are:  
- Understand the structure of the set \( C \) of points, particularly configurations of 4n points within the open unit square.  
- The goal is to find the maximum measure \(\mu\) that can be associated with certain rectangles \( R \) containing exactly one point from \( C \).  
- The problem suggests that the optimal configuration involves rectangles of a specific form, likely maximizing the measure while containing precisely one point.

Given the combinatorial setup, a plausible conjecture is that the maximum measure relates to dividing the unit square into strips or rectangles, each containing exactly one point, and summing their measures.  
Without explicit algebraic formulas, as a heuristic approach, we test small values of \( n \) and generate candidate configurations for the rectangles and points. We then seek the maximum measure achieved by these rectangles.

Below is a Python script that heuristically enumerates configurations for small \( n \) (like 1, 2, 3), assessing rectangle sizes, and outputs potential maximum measures. It prioritizes configurations with rectangles close to the unit square but ensuring exactly one point inside each.

```python
# Enumerate candidate rectangles for small n, estimate their measures, and find the maximum
# since the problem is geometric, we consider dividing the unit square into n rectangles,
# each containing exactly one point, aiming to maximize total measure.

def enumerate_configurations(max_n=3):
    results = []
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        # For each n, try dividing the unit square into n vertical strips
        # with varying widths and heights, ensuring that each strip contains exactly one point.
        max_measure = 0
        best_rect = None
        # Discretize division sizes (e.g., divide into equal parts for simplicity)
        for division_points in [[i / n for i in range(1, n)]]:  # uniform divisions
            # Generate rectangles as Ioo intervals
            x_intervals = []
            prev_x = 0
            for x in division_points:
                x_intervals.append((prev_x, x))
                prev_x = x
            x_intervals.append((prev_x, 1))
            # For each rectangle, choose midpoints and estimate measure
            measure_sum = 0
            for (a, b) in x_intervals:
                # Place point at midpoint; rectangle covers entire height
                width = b - a
                # Height is (0,1), so measure is width * 1
                rect_measure = width
                measure_sum += rect_measure
                if measure_sum > max_measure:
                    max_measure = measure_sum
                    best_rect = (a, b)
        print(f"For n={n}, maximum total measure â‰ˆ {max_measure:.3f}")
        print(f"Candidate rectangle for max measure: {best_rect}")
        results.append((n, max_measure))
