This problem appears to involve solving a linear equation for z in terms of integers x and y, and then defining a function `omnimath3035_answer` that computes z explicitly. The goal is to programmatically enumerate possible solutions (x, y, z) consistent with the equation `2x - 3z = 5y`, and define the answer as z given x and y, then verify the equivalence.

Since the main solution involves solving for z in terms of x and y, and the parameters are integers, the equation `2x - 3z = 5y` can be rearranged to find z:

`3z = 2x - 5y` => `z = (2x - 5y) / 3`

To ensure z is rational (which it always is), but to find integral solutions, (2x - 5y) must be divisible by 3.

Here's an enumeration: pick small integer ranges for x and y, verify divisibility, compute z accordingly, and output matches.

```python
# Enumerate small ranges for x and y, find those with (2x - 5y) divisible by 3,
# then compute z = (2x - 5y)/3, and print the results.

def enumerate_solutions():
    for x in range(-10, 11):
        for y in range(-10, 11):
            numerator = 2*x - 5*y
            if numerator % 3 == 0:
                z = numerator / 3
                print(f"Possible solution: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")

enumerate_solutions()
