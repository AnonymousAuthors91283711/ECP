To find the value of `(a + b) / c` given the conditions, I'll:
- Use the equations involving integer `a, b, c` and their relations with real numbers.
- Enumerate small positive integers, as the conditions suggest positive integers.
- For each candidate, solve the system:
  1. \(a + \frac{b}{c} = 101\)
  2. \(\frac{a}{c} + b = 68\)

Since the problem asks for a concrete value of `(a + b)/c`, I will produce all solutions that satisfy the equations with small positive integers, stream the answers, and identify the resulting `(a + b)/c`.

```python
# Enumerate small positive integer values for a, b, c and check the equations.
# This validates possible solutions and computes the desired expression.

for a in range(1, 102):  # a positive integer, roughly up to 101
    for c in range(1, 102):  # c positive integer
        # From the equations:
        # a + b/c = 101  => b = (101 - a) * c
        # (a / c) + b = 68
        # Substitute b:
        # (a / c) + (101 - a)*c = 68
        # Check if (101 - a)*c + (a / c) == 68
        # To avoid floating errors, rearranged:
        # (101 - a)*c + (a / c) == 68
        # Multiply through by c to avoid fraction:
        # ((101 - a)*c)*c + a == 68 * c
        total = (101 - a) * c * c + a
        if total == 68 * c:
            b = (101 - a) * c
            # Verify positivity:
            if b > 0:
                answer = (a + b) / c
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c} => (a+b)/c={answer}")
```
