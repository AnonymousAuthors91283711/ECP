This problem involves solving an algebraic equation with prime parameters p, q, r. Our goal is to explore possible solutions systematically, especially focusing on the derived equations involving p, q, r, and then determine the value of A based on those solutions. To do so efficiently, I will attempt small prime candidates for p, q, r, check the given equations, and explore the resulting conditions to find possible A values. We will print each candidate solution whenever the conditions are satisfied.

```python
# Enumerate small prime triples p, q, r with p != q != r.
# For each, verify the given equations and solve for A.
# Use a small prime list for quick checking.
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]

def is_prime(n):
    return n in primes

for p in primes:
    for q in primes:
        if q == p:
            continue
        for r in primes:
            if r == p or r == q:
                continue
            # Check the two equations:
            # 1) 2 * p * q * r + 50 * p * q == 7 * p * q * r + 55 * p * r
            # 2) 7 * p * q * r + 55 * p * r == 8 * p * q * r + 12 * q * r
            eq1_left = 2 * p * q * r + 50 * p * q
            eq1_right = 7 * p * q * r + 55 * p * r
            eq2_left = 7 * p * q * r + 55 * p * r
            eq2_right = 8 * p * q * r + 12 * q * r

            if eq1_left == eq1_right and eq2_left == eq2_right:
                # Verify the equations match
                # Solve for A:
                # The problem states: A = omnimath1687_answer
                # and the theorem gives some relations; here, estimate A from equations.
                # As no direct relation from the equations to A is given,
                # assume A depends on p, q, r.
                # For demonstration, let's take A as the expression (or a constant guessed from context).
                # Since there's no explicit formula, print the prime triplet and relations.
                A_value = (2 * p + q + r)  # Hypothetical function, provided for demonstration.
                print(f"p={p}, q={q}, r={r} => A={A_value}")
