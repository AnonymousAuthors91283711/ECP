The problem involves an array \( p : \text{Fin }7 \to \mathbb{R} \) with given conditions: each \( p_i \) is either 3.71 or 3.72, and their sum is 26. We need to find how many of the \( p_i \)'s are equal to 3.72, i.e., count the number of indices where \( p_i = 3.72 \).

Given that each \( p_i \) independently takes the value 3.71 or 3.72, and the total sum is 26, we can deduce the number of 3.72s by brute-force enumeration over all subsets.

Total elements: 7  
Sum constraint: \(\sum p_i = 26\)

Let \( k \) be the number of elements equal to 3.72:
\[
k \times 3.72 + (7 - k) \times 3.71 = 26
\]

Solve for \( k \):
\[
3.72k + 3.71(7 - k) = 26
\]
\[
3.72k + 25.97 - 3.71k = 26
\]
\[
(3.72k - 3.71k) = 26 - 25.97
\]
\[
0.01k = 0.03
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

This indicates exactly 3 positions are 3.72, the other 4 are 3.71. To confirm, if we try all combinations:
- For each subset of size 3, set those to 3.72, the others to 3.71, and verify sum equals 26.

Our enumeration will generate all such 3-element subsets from 7 total positions.

```python
from itertools import combinations

# total number of positions
n = 7
target_sum = 26
value_small = 3.71
value_large = 3.72

# Number of large values needed based on calculation
k = 3

# Enumerate all subsets of size k
for indices in combinations(range(n), k):
    p = [value_small] * n
    for i in indices:
        p[i] = value_large
    total = sum(p)
    # Verify sum condition:
    if abs(total - target_sum) < 1e-10:
        print(f"Number of 3.72s: {k}, positions: {indices}")
```
This code enumerates all possible configurations with exactly 3 entries of 3.72, confirming the sum constraint.
