This math problem asks us to find all real solutions to the equation:

\[
(x^2 + 3x + 2)(x^2 - 7x + 12)(x^2 - 2x - 1) + 24 = 0
\]

It's beneficial to factor the quadratic expressions, where possible, and then analyze roots to find the solutions. We will systematically evaluate candidate solutions based on the factors, and also check for solutions from the original equation. Since the factors are quadratic and can be factored into linear factors, let's analyze and test candidate roots.

The plan:
- Factor each quadratic:
  - \(x^2 + 3x + 2 = (x+1)(x+2)\)
  - \(x^2 - 7x + 12 = (x-3)(x-4)\)
  - \(x^2 - 2x -1\) remains quadratic; solutions are \(x = 1 \pm \sqrt{2}\).
  
- Substitute solutions corresponding to roots of the quadratic factors into the equation and evaluate, considering the values near these roots and the quadratic roots themselves.

- Since the equation simplifies to zero when the product is \(-24\), we analyze rational roots and key points.

Here's a Python script that explicitly evaluates the candidate roots and some points of interest:

```python
# Candidate roots from factorization
candidate_roots = [-2, -1, 3, 4]  # roots of the quadratic factors
# Roots from quadratic x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0
quadratic_roots = [1 + 2**0.5, 1 - 2**0.5]

# Evaluate the original expression at these points
def f(x):
    return (x**2 + 3*x + 2)*(x**2 - 7*x + 12)*(x**2 - 2*x - 1) + 24

# Check candidate roots
for root in candidate_roots + quadratic_roots:
    val = f(root)
    print(f"x = {root:.4f}, f(x) = {val:.4f}")

# Also evaluate at some sample points to find other solutions if needed
for x in [-5, -3, 0, 2, 5, 6]:
    val = f(x)
    if abs(val) < 1e-6:  # very close to zero
        print(f"Approximate solution near x = {x}, f(x) = {val}")
```

This code precisely checks the key roots and some sample points where solutions might lie. It streams solutions as they are found, assisting in the conjecture of the exact roots. Based on the evaluations, you can extract the approximate solutions or refine further with more detailed checks.

```python
# Candidate roots from factorization
candidate_roots = [-2, -1, 3, 4]
# Roots from quadratic x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0
quadratic_roots = [1 + 2**0.5, 1 - 2**0.5]

def f(x):
    return (x**2 + 3*x + 2)*(x^2 - 7*x + 12)*(x**2 - 2*x - 1) + 24

for root in candidate_roots + quadratic_roots:
    val = f(root)
    print(f"x = {root:.4f}, f(x) = {val:.4f}")

for x in [-5, -3, 0, 2, 5, 6]:
    val = f(x)
    if abs(val) < 1e-6:
        print(f"Approximate solution near x = {x}, f(x) = {val}")
```
