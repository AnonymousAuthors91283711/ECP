This problem involves three positive real numbers \(x, y, z\) satisfying \(x + y + z = xyz\), and an expression involving these variables:
\[
x^7(yz - 1) + y^7(zx - 1) + z^7(xy - 1)
\]
The goal is to find the minimal value of this expression under the constraint, by exploring particular solutions.

Since the expression and constraints look symmetric, a natural initial approach is to test cases where \(x, y, z\) are equal, i.e., \(x=y=z\). For \(x=y=z\), the constraint simplifies and might give an insight into the minimal value.

Let's determine the value in that case:
\[
3x = x^3 \Rightarrow x^3 - 3x = 0 \Rightarrow x(x^2 -3)=0
\]
Since \(x>0\), we discard \(x=0\). So:
\[
x^2=3 \Rightarrow x=\sqrt{3}
\]

Now, evaluate the expression for \(x=y=z=\sqrt{3}\):
\[
x^7(yz - 1) = (\sqrt{3})^7 ((\sqrt{3})^2 -1) = 3^{3.5} (3 -1) = 3^{3.5} \times 2
\]
Because
\[
3^{3.5} = 3^{3} \times 3^{0.5} = 27 \times \sqrt{3} \approx 27 \times 1.732 = 46.872
\]
Multiply by 2:
\[
46.872 \times 2 \approx 93.744
\]
Since the expression sums three identical terms, total:
\[
3 \times 93.744 \approx 281.232
\]
which is quite large.

Thus, the symmetric solution yields a value around 281.

Next, to look for smaller values, consider other plausible solutions.

Given the symmetry and positivity, perhaps solutions where two variables are equal and the third different.

Let's try \(x=y\), \(z\) arbitrary, with \(x,y > 0\). The key constraint:
\[
2x + z = x^2 z
\]

Suppose \(x = y = t > 0\), then the constraint becomes:
\[
2t + z = t^2 z \Rightarrow t^2 z - z= 2t \Rightarrow z(t^2 -1)= 2t
\]
If \(t \neq 1\):
\[
z = \frac{2t}{t^2 -1}
\]
since \(z>0\), numerator and denominator must have the same sign. For \(t>0\):
- If \(t>1\), then \(t^2 -1>0\),
- \(z>0\), so \(2t>0\), consistent.

Now, compute the expression:
\[
x^7(yz -1) + y^7(zx -1) + z^7(xy -1)
\]
Since \(x=y=t\), this simplifies to:
\[
t^7( t z -1) + t^7(z t -1) + z^7(t^2 -1)
\]
\[
= 2 t^7 ( t z -1) + z^7(t^2 -1)
\]

Substitute \(z = \frac{2t}{t^2 -1}\):

Calculate \(t z\):
\[
t \times \frac{2t}{t^2 -1} = \frac{2 t^2}{t^2 -1}
\]
then:
\[
t z -1 = \frac{2 t^2}{t^2 -1} -1 = \frac{2 t^2 - (t^2 -1)}{t^2 -1} = \frac{2 t^2 - t^2 + 1}{t^2 -1} = \frac{t^2 + 1}{t^2 -1}
\]

Now, \(z^7\):
\[
z^7 = \left( \frac{2 t}{t^2 -1} \right)^7 = \frac{2^7 t^7}{(t^2 -1)^7}
\]

Putting it all together:

Expression \(E(t)\):
\[
E(t) = 2 t^7 \times \frac{t^2 + 1}{t^2 -1} + \frac{2^7 t^7}{(t^2 -1)^7} \times (t^2 -1)
\]
Observe that:
\[
z^7 (t^2 -1) = \frac{2^7 t^7}{(t^2 -1)^7} \times (t^2 -1) = 2^7 t^7 \times \frac{1}{(t^2 -1)^6}
\]

Similarly, the first part:
\[
2 t^7 \times \frac{t^2 + 1}{t^2 -1} = 2 t^7 \times \frac{t^2 + 1}{t^2 -1}
\]

Total:
\[
E(t) = 2 t^7 \times \frac{t^2 + 1}{t^2 -1} + 2^7 t^7 \times \frac{1}{(t^2 -1)^6}
\]
We can factor \(t^7\):
\[
E(t) = t^7 \left[ 2 \frac{t^2 + 1}{t^2 -1} + 128 \frac{1}{(t^2 -1)^6} \right]
\]

Let \(s = t^2\), \(s>0\)

Then:
\[
E(s) = s^{3.5} \left[ 2 \frac{s + 1}{s -1} + 128 \frac{1}{(s -1)^6} \right]
\]

Now, for specific \(t\), say \(t=2\):

\[
s=4
\]
Calculate:

\[
E(4) = 4^{3.5} \left[ 2 \times \frac{4+1}{4-1} + 128 \times \frac{1}{(4-1)^6} \right]
\]
\[
4^{3.5} = 2^{7} = 128
\]

Compute inside brackets:

\[
2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.333
\]
and
\[
(4-1)^6 = 3^6 = 729
\]
So:
\[
128 \times \frac{1}{729} \approx 128/729 \approx 0.175
\]
Sum:
\[
3.333 + 0.175 \approx 3.508
\]
Then total:
\[
128 \times 3.508 \approx 448.9
\]
which is larger than previous estimates (~281), so likely not minimal.

Try \(t\) closer to 1 from above:

Set \(t=1.1\):

\[
s=1.21
\]
Compute:

\[
s^{3.5} = e^{3.5 \times \ln 1.21} \approx e^{3.5 \times 0.1906} \approx e^{0.667} \approx 1.948
\]
Also:
\[
s+1=2.21, \quad s-1=0.21
\]
Calculate:

\[
2 \times \frac{2.21}{0.21} \approx 2 \times 10.52 \approx 21.04
\]
and:
\[
128 \times \frac{1}{(0.21)^6} \approx 128 / (0.21)^6
\]
\[
(0.21)^6 \approx (0.21)^2 \times (0.21)^2 \times (0.21)^2 \approx (0.0441) \times (0.0441) \times (0.0441) \approx 8.56 \times 10^{-5}
\]
Then:
\[
128 / 8.56 \times 10^{-5} \approx 128 / 8.56e-5 \approx 1.495 \times 10^6
\]
Multiply by \(s^{3.5} \approx 1.948\):

\[
\approx 1.948 \times 1.495 \times 10^6 \approx 2.911 \times 10^6
\]
which is huge! So \(t\) close to 1 is not promising.

From computations, larger \(t\) seems to lead to larger values; trying smaller \(t\) might help, but because of the expressions' positivity and behavior, the minimal value likely occurs near some specific configuration.

Alternatively, test a known special solution like \(x=y=z=1\). Check the constraint:

\[
x + y + z=3. \quad
xyz=1
\]
So:
\[
3=1 \Rightarrow \text{not satisfied}
\]
Hence, solution not valid.

Furthermore, the earlier symmetric solution yields approximately 281, much larger than zero.

Now, consider that when \(x y z = x + y + z\), as in the symmetric case, the minimal value seems not to be less than 0, but perhaps it's negative.

Because in the initial cases, all are positive and the expression seems to be positive.

Given the symmetry and that the detailed computations indicate the value is always large and positive, perhaps the minimal value is zero.

Let's test the possibility that the value can approach zero.

Suppose that one of the factors \(y z -1\) tends to zero, i.e., \(y z \to 1\).

If \(y z = 1\), then:

\[
x + y + z = x y z = x \times 1 = x
\]
\[
x + y + z = x \Rightarrow y + z= 0
\]
but since \(y,z>0\), sum cannot be zero; so impossible.

Alternatively, approximate situations where some of the terms approach zero.

Implement a small search over positive \(x, y, z\) satisfying the constraint, especially those with simple rational ratios.

Given the symmetry and the calculations, as well as earlier insight, the minimal value seems to be around 0, but not achieved exactly.

In conclusion, the smallest possible value (or the infimum) is likely 0, but perhaps not achieved by any real \(x,y,z\).

We will implement a program that searches for solutions with small rational parameters and outputs the corresponding values to assist in conjecture.
