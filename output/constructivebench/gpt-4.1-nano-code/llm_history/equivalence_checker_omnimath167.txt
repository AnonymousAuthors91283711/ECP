Ground Truth Answer: 25
Proposed Answer: 3
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find the smallest natural number n ≥ 2 where 2^(2^n) mod (2^n - 1) is not a power of 4.

2. The ground truth answer is 25, which means that for n=25, 2^(2^25) mod (2^25 - 1) is not a power of 4.

3. The proposed answer is 3. Let's test this:
   - For n=3: 2^3 - 1 = 7
   - 2^(2^3) = 2^8 = 256
   - 256 mod 7 = 4 (since 7*36=252, 256-252=4)
   - 4 is a power of 4 (4^1), so n=3 doesn't satisfy the condition

The proposed answer (3) is incorrect because it does satisfy the condition that the modulus is a power of 4. The ground truth answer (25) is correct as it's the smallest number where this fails.
