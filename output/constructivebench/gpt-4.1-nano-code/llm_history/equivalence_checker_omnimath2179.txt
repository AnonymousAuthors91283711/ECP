Ground Truth Answer: 6 * 5 * 4 * (6 * 5 * 4 / 6)
Proposed Answer: (Nat.choose 6 3) * (Nat.choose 6 3) * Nat.factorial 3
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
We need to count the number of 3-element subsets of Fin 6 × Fin 6 where:
1. All elements have distinct first coordinates
2. All elements have distinct second coordinates

This is equivalent to selecting:
1. 3 distinct rows (from 6 possible)
2. 3 distinct columns (from 6 possible)
3. A way to assign each selected row to a selected column (permutation)

Ground Truth Answer:
6 * 5 * 4 * (6 * 5 * 4 / 6) = C(6,3)*3! * C(6,3)*3! / 6
This counts:
- C(6,3) for row selection
- C(6,3) for column selection
- 3! for row-column assignments
- Divided by 6 to account for overcounting

Proposed Answer:
C(6,3) * C(6,3) * 3! = C(6,3) * C(6,3) * 6
This counts:
- C(6,3) for row selection
- C(6,3) for column selection
- 3! for row-column assignments

The proposed answer overcounts by a factor of 6 because it counts each solution 6 times (for the 6 possible orderings of the 3 elements). The ground truth correctly divides by 6 to account for this.
