noncomputable abbrev omnimath542_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath542 : 
  ∃ (xs : Finset ℝ), (∀ x ∈ xs, 0 < x ∧ x < π ∧ 1 + sin x / sin (4 * x) = sin (3 * x) / sin (2 * x)) ∧ 
    xs.sum id = omnimath542_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Sum of solutions: 0.0000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests that the solutions are at the boundary points where the expression simplifies or becomes undefined, likely at zero or multiples of π/2. Given the enumerated answer approximates zero, the sum probably simplifies to zero.
