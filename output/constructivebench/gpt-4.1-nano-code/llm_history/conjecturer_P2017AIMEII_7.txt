Based on the pattern in enumerations and the nature of the equation, the unique value of \( k \) that satisfies the given conditions is the one making the equation reducible to a quadratic in \( x \). Analyzing the form, it appears that the only integer \( k \) in the interval \([-500, 500]\) corresponding to a unique solution is \( k = 4 \). 

Thus, the answer in Lean form is:

<<<fun _ => 1>>>

This represents that exactly one such \( k \) exists, which is consistent with the problem's stated answer count.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The problem asks for the cardinality of the set of integers k between -500 and 500 (inclusive), satisfying the condition that there exists a unique real x such that log(k×x) = 2×log(x+2). The question reduces to identifying the number of such k.

Analyzing the condition:

log(kx) = 2 log(x+2)

⇒ log(kx) = log((x+2)^2)

⇒ kx = (x+2)^2

Since we are considering x in ℝ with the domain restrictions (x + 2 ≠ 0, x ≠ 0), the solutions for x satisfy:

x = (x+2)^2 / k

which implies:

k x = (x+2)^2

a quadratic in x:

k x = x^2 + 4x + 4

→ x^2 + (4 - k) x + 4 = 0

For the existence of a *unique* solution x, the quadratic must have discriminant zero:

Δ = (k - 4)^2 - 4 * 1 * 4 = (k - 4)^2 - 16

Set to zero:

(k - 4)^2 - 16 = 0

→ (k - 4)^2 = 16

→ k - 4 = ±4

→ k = 4 + 4 = 8, or k = 4 - 4 = 0

Now, check for the validity of these solutions:

- For k=0:

The quadratic reduces to:

x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0

Discriminant zero, solution:

x = -2

Now, check if it satisfies the original log condition:

log(0×x) = log(0) undefined; thus the solution is invalid as 0×x = 0 implies log(0), which is undefined. So k=0 is invalid.

- For k=8:

Quadratic:

x^2 + (4 - 8) x + 4 = x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0

Solution:

x = 2

Check the original:

log(8×2) = 2 log(2 + 2)

Left: log(16) = 2.772...

Right: 2 log(4) = 2×1.386... = 2.772...

Equal; the solution x=2 is valid.

Furthermore, the solution is unique, matching the discriminant zero condition.

Thus, the only valid k in [-500, 500] satisfying the condition is 8.

Since we are to return the cardinality of such k, the answer is 1, because exactly one such k exists, namely 8.

In Lean, the number 1 suffices as the answer.

Hence, the enriched answer expression:

<<<fun _ => 1>>>

This matches the expected answer type of ℕ and aligns with the enumeration outcome.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
