The problem appears to involve finding the greatest natural number `n` satisfying certain conditions: divisible by 36, all digits are even, and digits are unique. The candidate answers relate to the pattern `[8,6,4,2,0]` when reconstructed as a number, multiplied by 36. We want to enumerate options for `n` and verify these conditions.

We will:
- Generate candidate permutations of `[8,6,4,2,0]`.
- Convert each permutation into a number.
- Check if it is divisible by 36.
- Use the largest such number.

The code will systematically enumerate all permutations, check the conditions, and output candidates as they are found. The focus is on efficiency, minimal code, and clear enumeration.

```python
import itertools

# List of digits to permute
digits = [8, 6, 4, 2, 0]

max_number = -1
max_number_str = ""

# Enumerate all permutations of the digits
for perm in itertools.permutations(digits):
    # Skip permutations where the leading digit is 0 (not a valid number)
    if perm[0] == 0:
        continue
    # Convert permutation to number
    n = int(''.join(map(str, perm)))
    # Check divisibility by 36
    if n % 36 == 0:
        print(n)
        if n > max_number:
            max_number = n
            max_number_str = ''.join(map(str, perm))

# Output the greatest number found and associated data
print("Greatest candidate:", max_number)
print("Digits:", max_number_str)
```
