The problem involves evaluating the expression \(\left(10^{9^2 - 9}\right)^{1/9}^{1/2}^{1/2}\). Let's analyze it step-by-step:

- \(9^2 - 9 = 81 - 9 = 72\).

- The expression is \(\left(10^{72}\right)^{1/9}^{1/2}^{1/2}\).

- First, \(\left(10^{72}\right)^{1/9} = 10^{72/9} = 10^8\).

- Then, take \(\left(10^8\right)^{1/2} = 10^{8/2} = 10^4\).

- Finally, raise to the last \(1/2\): \((10^4)^{1/2} = 10^{4/2} = 10^2 = 100\).

Thus, the value simplifies to 100.

Here's the Python program that verifies this calculation and outputs the answer directly:

```python
# Compute the expression step-by-step
base_exponent = 72  # since 9^2 - 9 = 81 - 9 = 72
initial_value = 10 ** base_exponent

# First root: (initial_value)^{1/9}
step1 = initial_value ** (1/9)  # 10^{72/9} = 10^{8}

# Second root: (step1)^{1/2}
step2 = step1 ** (1/2)  # 10^{8/2} = 10^{4}

# Third root: (step2)^{1/2}
final_result = step2 ** (1/2)  # 10^{4/2} = 10^{2} = 100

# Since the calculation yields an exact value, print it directly
print(final_result)
```
