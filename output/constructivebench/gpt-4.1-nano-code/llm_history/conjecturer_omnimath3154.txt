Total solutions: 8. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
From pattern observations, each pair satisfies m² = n³ + 5n², with n increasing non-linearly. Summing these n's yields 4 + 11 + 20 + 31 + 44 + 59 + 76 + 95 = 340. Since the problem asks for the total solutions, the answer is the sum over all such n. 

<<<340>>>
