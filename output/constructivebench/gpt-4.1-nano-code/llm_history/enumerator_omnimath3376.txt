This problem is about a class of students each characterized by a pair of eye positions on a 3Ã—3 grid. Given the proportions of students with at least one eye on each row, we need to determine the proportion of students with both eyes on the same row. By enumerating all assignments consistent with the given proportions, we can estimate this.

Steps:
- Assume a small finite number of students (e.g., n=100) for manageable enumeration.
- Generate all possible eye position assignments consistent with the given proportions.
- Count the proportion where both eyes are on the same row.
- Yield each candidate proportion as a decimal.

Since the code must run without inputs and produce partial enumeration, we'll:
- Fix total students `n=100`.
- Use the given fractions to determine counts for each row.
- Generate all valid distributions, then calculate the proportion with same row eyes.

```python
import itertools

# Total number of students for enumeration
n = 100

# Given proportions
prop_eggshell = 3/10
prop_cream = 4/10
prop_cornsilk = 5/10

# Counts based on proportions
count_eggshell = int(prop_eggshell * n)
count_cream = int(prop_cream * n)
count_cornsilk = int(prop_cornsilk * n)

# Generate all possible distributions of eye positions satisfying the counts
rows = [0, 1, 2]
solutions = []

for e_r in itertools.combinations_with_replacement(rows, count_eggshell):
    # Permutation of the first group
    for c_r in itertools.combinations_with_replacement(rows, count_cream):
        # Permutation of the second group
        for co_r in itertools.combinations_with_replacement(rows, count_cornsilk):
            # All assignments
            assignment = []
            assignment.extend([e_r_i for e_r_i in e_r])
            assignment.extend([c_r_i for c_r_i in c_r])
            assignment.extend([co_r_i for co_r_i in co_r])
            if len(assignment) == n:
                # Count students with both eyes on same row
                same_row = sum(1 for s in range(n) if assignment[s] == assignment[s % (count_eggshell + count_cream + count_cornsilk)])
                proportion = same_row / n
                print(proportion)
```
