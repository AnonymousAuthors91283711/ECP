Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: { p : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ | p = (1, 10, 10) ∨ p = (10, 1, 10) ∨ p = (10, 10, 1) }
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer lists all three permutations of (1, 10, 10) as solutions to the equation a³ + b³ + c³ = 2001 with a, b, c > 0. Indeed:
1³ + 10³ + 10³ = 1 + 1000 + 1000 = 2001
These are the only positive integer solutions, as verified by exhaustive search within reasonable bounds (since 13³ = 2197 > 2001, we don't need to check beyond 12). The answer correctly captures all permutations of the solution.
