[write_program]
The problem seems to involve proving an inequality involving non-negative real numbers \(a, b, c, d\) summing to 4, with the expression:
\[
\frac{a}{a^3 + 8} + \frac{b}{b^3 + 8} + \frac{c}{c^3 + 8} + \frac{d}{d^3 + 8} \leq \frac{4}{9}
\]
Our goal is to estimate or find the extremal values for this sum under the constraints, probably by exploring candidate solutions.

Since the problem is symmetric and involves non-negativity with a fixed sum, a common approach is to test particular distributionsâ€”e.g., all equal, some variables at extremes, or small parameters.

I will write a Python program that:
- Fixes the sum to 4.
- Checks various non-negative combinations, including equal splits and variations with some variables at boundary values.
- Evaluates the sum to see if it approaches or exceeds \(4/9 \approx 0.4444\).
- Streams each candidate evaluation.

The program will sample systematically: 
- All four variables equal (\(a=b=c=d=1\))
- One variable large, others small
- Two variables equal, others zero, etc.

This helps conjecture bounds and extremal configurations quickly.

```python
# Enumerate candidate values for a, b, c, d with sum = 4
# We choose representative points: equal, boundary, and fractional splits
import itertools

def eval_sum(a, b, c, d):
    return (a / (a**3 + 8) + 
            b / (b**3 + 8) + 
            c / (c**3 + 8) + 
            d / (d**3 + 8))

# Candidate distributions:
candidates = []

# Equal split: a=b=c=d=1
a=b=c=d=1
sum_value = eval_sum(a,b,c,d)
print(f"equal (1,1,1,1): sum = {sum_value}")
candidates.append((a,b,c,d))

# One variable at maximum, others at zero: e.g. a=4, others=0
a=4; b=c=d=0
sum_value=eval_sum(a,b,c,d)
print(f"max one (4,0,0,0): sum = {sum_value}")
candidates.append((a,b,c,d))

# Two variables equal, others zero: a=b=2, c=d=0
a=b=2; c=d=0
sum_value=eval_sum(a,b,c,d)
print(f"two equal (2,2,0,0): sum = {sum_value}")
candidates.append((a,b,c,d))

# Distribute evenly: e.g. (2,1,1,0)
for a,b,c,d in [(2,1,1,0), (1.5,1.5,0.5,0.5), (3,0.5,0.25,0.25), (3.5,0.25,0.25,0.0)]:
    sum_value=eval_sum(a,b,c,d)
    print(f"distribution ({a},{b},{c},{d}): sum = {sum_value}")
    candidates.append((a,b,c,d))

# Slight variations around equal distribution to see fluctuation
for vals in itertools.product([0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0], repeat=4):
    if abs(sum(vals)-4)<1e-6:
        sum_value=eval_sum(*vals)
        print(f"varied ({vals}): sum = {sum_value}")
        candidates.append(vals)
```
