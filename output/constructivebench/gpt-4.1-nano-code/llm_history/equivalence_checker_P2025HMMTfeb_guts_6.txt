Ground Truth Answer: 2 * sqrt 13
Proposed Answer: sqrt 41
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes an equilateral triangle ABC with points D on BC (BD=1, DC=4), and points E and F on rays extending from A through C and B respectively, such that D is the midpoint of EF.

2. The ground truth answer is 2√13 ≈ 7.211
3. The proposed answer is √41 ≈ 6.403

Key observations:
- In an equilateral triangle with side length 5 (since BD + DC = 5), the distance EF should be larger than the side length when E and F are extended outward.
- The ground truth answer (2√13) is indeed larger than 5, while the proposed answer (√41) is smaller than 5, which contradicts the geometry of the problem.
- The correct calculation should involve vector geometry and midpoint properties, leading to EF = 2√13.
