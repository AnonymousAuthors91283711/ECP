This problem appears to involve finding the maximum size of a subset \( S \subseteq \{1, 2, \ldots, 30\} \) such that for any two distinct elements \( x, y \in S \), the sum \( x + y \) is not divisible by 5.

To solve this, we need to:
- Partition the numbers 1 to 30 into residue classes modulo 5.
- Understand the restrictions: If sums are not divisible by 5, then no pair from certain classes can both be in \( S \).
- Maximize the size of \( S \) considering these restrictions.

Specifically:
- Numbers modulo 5 are grouped into classes: {1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26}, etc.
- Pairs whose sum modulo 5 is 0 cannot both be in \( S \).

I will:
- Generate the residue classes.
- For each class, count possible maximum sets.
- Check combinations, respecting the restrictions, to find the maximum size.

```python
# Enumerate residue classes modulo 5
residue_classes = {r: [x for x in range(1, 31) if x % 5 == r] for r in range(5)}

# Pairs of classes whose combined sum mod 5 equals 0 (forbidden to both be in S together)
conflicts = [(1,4), (2,3)]  # classes that cannot both have elements in S

max_size = 0

# For each class, find the maximum subset ignoring conflicts:
# Since within the same class, no restriction, take all elements
class_sizes = {r: len(residue_classes[r]) for r in range(5)}

# Check all combinations of selecting or not selecting conflicting classes
from itertools import combinations, chain

# Generate all subsets of classes
for included_classes in chain.from_iterable(combinations(residue_classes.keys(), r) for r in range(1, 6)):
    # Check for conflicts
    included_set = set(included_classes)
    if any(a in included_set and b in included_set for a, b in conflicts):
        continue  # conflicts present, skip
    # Sum sizes of included classes
    size = sum(class_sizes[r] for r in included_classes)
    if size > max_size:
        max_size = size
        print(max_size)  # Stream the current maximum as we find larger sets

print("Maximum size of S:", max_size)
```
