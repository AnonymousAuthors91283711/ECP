noncomputable abbrev olympiadbench2459_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2459 (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
    (∃ a b : ℝ, (∀ x, f x = a * x + b) ∧ a ≠ 0 ∧ (∀ x, f x - invFun f x = 44)) ↔ f = olympiadbench2459_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate function: f(x) = 1.0 * x + 22.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
<<<fun x => x + 22>>>, because the given functional equation reduces to f(x) - (x / a + b / a) = 44 with a=1, b=22, satisfying all conditions.
