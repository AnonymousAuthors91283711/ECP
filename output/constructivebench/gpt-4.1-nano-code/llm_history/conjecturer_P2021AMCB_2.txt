The current statement attempts to define `P2021AMCB_2_answer` as a verbose comment rather than a closed form expression in Lean syntax, hence the errors. To fix this, I will eliminate the textual explanation and directly assign the simplified calculation as the value of `P2021AMCB_2_answer`.

The operations involve straightforward integer arithmetic. Therefore, the correct approach is to express the answer as a Lean arithmetic expression: `66 - 23 - (57 - 2 * 23)`. Since all variables are known numerical constants, we can compute this algebraically or concretely in Lean, but for a closed form, we simply write the expression itself.

Hence, the fixed code will be:

```lean
<<<66 - 23 - (57 - 2 * 23)>>>
```

This matches the calculations in the example and is a valid Lean expression. It directly encodes the solution and avoids unnecessary text or syntax errors. This final answer can then be used in a proof or further elaboration within Lean.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error occurs because the abbreviation `P2021AMCB_2_answer` is declared as `abbrev P2021AMCB_2_answer : ℕ := sorry`, but in the current proposed answer, `<<< ... >>>` is used, which is interpreted as a syntax error in Lean. The `<<< ... >>>` delimiters are for parsing answers in the prompt context but are not valid inside Lean code.

The answer should be a valid Lean expression of type `ℕ`, equivalent to the enumerated answer `32`, and should be written as a normal Lean expression without delimiters.

Based on the enumerated answer `32`, and the current calculation:
- `mixed_pairs = blue - 2 * blue_blue_pairs = 57 - 2 * 23 = 57 - 46 = 11`
- `yellow_yellow_pairs = total_pairs - blue_blue_pairs - mixed_pairs = 66 - 23 - 11 = 66 - 34 = 32`

The intended expression is simply `66 - 23 - (57 - 2 * 23)` which simplifies to `66 - 23 - 11 = 32`.

To fix the error, remove the delimiters and assign directly:

```lean
66 - 23 - (57 - 2 * 23)
```

Final corrected answer:

<<<66 - 23 - (57 - 2 * 23)>>>

This expression correctly computes to 32 and is a valid Lean term of type `ℕ`.
