The problem involves a function \(P : \mathrm{Fin}\, 268 \to \mathbb{Z}\) satisfying certain sum conditions and specific values at some points, and asks to determine \(P\, 210\). The given conditions strongly suggest a periodic structure in \(P\), especially because sums over fixed-length ranges are constant.

Our goal is to explore all possible values of \(P\, 210\) consistent with the provided constraints, considering the sum conditions \(hPsum\), the specific values \(hP17, hP83, hP144\).

Key observations:
- The sum over each 20-range shifts remains constant, suggesting \(P\) is related to a periodic function modulo 20.
- The specific points provided (17, 83, 144) relate to different positions; note that \(83 - 17 = 66\), \(144 - 83 = 61\).
- To explore possible \(P(210)\), we can parametrize \(P\) values consistent with the sum constraints and known values.

The approach:
- Use the sum equalities to derive constraints on the values of \(P\) over a typical window.
- Constrain \(P(17)\), \(P(83)\), \(P(144)\) and see the impact on \(P(210)\), which relates to these ranges.
- Enumerate possible solutions within ranges, considering the known points.

Below is a Python program that:
- Defines sample constraints.
- Iterates over possible \(P(i)\) consistent with the sum constraints.
- Prints each candidate value of \(P(210)\) satisfying these constraints.

```python
# Enumerate possible P values at key points based on sum constraints
# Given the sum of 20 terms, and known values at certain positions,
# we attempt to find all consistent P(210).

# Since the problem suggests a periodic or related structure, start with plausible assumptions:
# For simplicity, assume P is periodic mod 20 (though not necessarily).
# We analyze the sum constraints over the ranges.

# Constraints:
# Sum over [i, i+19] of P((i + j) % 268) = 75 for all i.

# Values at specific points:
# P(17) = 3
# P(83) = 4
# P(144) = 9

# The problem reduces to solving for P(210), considering the constraints.

# Let's generate possible P(210) based on these constraints.

possible_results = set()

# Since 210 is arbitrary, relate it to known points:
# 210 - 17 = 193
# 210 - 83 = 127
# 210 - 144 = 66

# Explore plausible P(210) by assuming possible sums at position shifts.

# For simplicity, assume P's are within a small integer range, e.g., -10..10
# to limit runtime and output.

for P17 in range(-10, 11):
    for P83 in range(-10, 11):
        for P144 in range(-10, 11):
            # Now, check consistency with sum constraints.
            # Since sum over range is 75:
            # For position i, sum over P(i+j)%268 for j in 0..19 equals 75.
            # We use the known points to approximate P(210):
            # P(210) corresponds to j = 193 (since 210 = 17 + 193),
            # 210 = 83 + 127,
            # 210 = 144 + 66.
            # We simulate the possible P(210) based on these offsets.

            # Since we have only three sample points, make a rough estimate:
            # For the sum over 20 elements, the average element is 75/20 = 3.75
            # P(210) could be around 3, 4, or 9, but bounded by the assumptions

                sum_estimate = sum([P17, P83, P144, candidate])
