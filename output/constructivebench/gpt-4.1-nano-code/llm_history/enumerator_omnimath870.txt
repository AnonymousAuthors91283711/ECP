This problem seems to involve probability, counting outcomes, and calculating a fraction. Let's clarify the scenario:

- Total outcomes: 6^4 (possible outcomes when 4 dice with 6 faces)
- Favorable outcomes: any outcome with all 4 dice different, minus those with some specific overlaps or constraints:
  - 4^4: total outcomes with 4 choices each (probably for some arrangement)
  - 3^4: outcomes with all four choices from only 3 options (some restriction)
  - 5^4 and 4^4: similar reasoning for other subsets

The key is to verify the count of favorable outcomes and compute the probability.

Let's write code that:
- Enumerates all configurations (e.g., all outcomes of 4 dice)
- Counts the favorable ones according to the description
- Computes the probability as a fraction

Since the total number is small (6^4=1296), enumeration is feasible.

```python
# Enumerate all outcomes of 4 dice with faces 1-6
# Count favorable outcomes based on the problem's description
# and compute the probability as a rational number

from fractions import Fraction

total_outcomes = 6 ** 4

favorable_count = 0
for d1 in range(1, 7):
    for d2 in range(1, 7):
        for d3 in range(1, 7):
            for d4 in range(1, 7):
                # Example condition: all dice different
                if len({d1, d2, d3, d4}) == 4:
                    favorable_count += 1

# For demonstration, let's print the number of favorable outcomes
# and compute the probability
answer_fraction = Fraction(favorable_count, total_outcomes)
print(f"Favorable outcomes: {favorable_count}")
print(f"Total outcomes: {total_outcomes}")
print(f"Probability: {answer_fraction}")

# Output the exact fraction representing the answer
print(f"Answer as fraction: {answer_fraction}")

# Assign to the specified abbreviation
omnimath870_answer = answer_fraction
```
