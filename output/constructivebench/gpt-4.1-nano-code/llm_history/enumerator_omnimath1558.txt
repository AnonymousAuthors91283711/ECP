This problem involves finding the maximum value of \( x \) such that the sequence terms satisfy certain linear and geometric relationships. The key insights:
- \( a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \) (arithmetic sequence)
- \( b_n = b_1 r^{n-1} \) (geometric sequence)
- Three known product relations involving \( a_1, d, b_1, r \) and \( x \), specifically at \( n=0,1,2,3 \).

Given the constraints:
\[
a_1 b_1 = 20
\]
\[
(a_1 + d) \times b_1 r = 19
\]
\[
(a_1 + 2d) \times b_1 r^2 = 14
\]
\[
a_1 + 3d \quad,\quad b_1 r^3 \quad,\quad \text{and } x = (a_1 + 3d) \times b_1 r^3
\]

We can derive relations among these variables by substituting and eliminating parameters, then inspecting the possible values of \( x \). Since the problem asks for enumeration, these suggest sampling plausible values for parameters and computing resulting \( x \).

Below is a Python code that:
- Uses plausible small sample values for \( a_1, d, b_1, r \).
- Checks for the consistency of the constraints.
- Computes candidate \( x \) values.
- Prints each candidate x immediately.

```python
# Program to enumerate candidate max x values based on the problem constraints

import math

# Define small parameter ranges for sampling
a1_range = [i for i in range(1, 50)]      # a1 > 0 to ensure real solutions
d_range = [i/10 for i in range(-50, 50)]  # d can be negative or positive
b1_range = [i for i in range(1, 100)]
r_range = [1 + i/10 for i in range(0, 20)] # r > 1

for a1 in a1_range:
    for b1 in b1_range:
        # From a1 * b1 = 20, check if close
        if abs(a1 * b1 - 20) > 1e-3:
            continue
        for d in d_range:
            a2 = a1 + d
            # From (a1 + d) * b1 * r = 19 => r = 19 / (a2 * b1)
            # To get candidate r, check if plausible
            for r in r_range:
                denom = a2 * b1
                if abs(denom) < 1e-8:
                    continue
                rhs_r = 19 / denom
                if abs(rhs_r - r) > 0.5:
                    continue
                # Compute a3 and b3
                a3 = a1 + 2*d
                b3 = b1 * r**2
                x_candidate = (a1 + 3*d) * b1 * r**3
                # Check third constraint
                lhs = a3 * b3
                if abs(lhs - 14) > 1e-2:
                    continue
                # Print candidate x immediately
                print(f"Candidate x: {x_candidate:.4f} with a1={a1}, d={d}, b1={b1}, r={r}")
```
