The problem involves determining the set of real numbers \( x \) such that \( \frac{x}{2} < x^2 < x \). We need to find and prove this set explicitly. To do so, let's analyze the inequalities:

1. \( \frac{x}{2} < x^2 \)
2. \( x^2 < x \)

which combine to define the set.

Key observations:
- For \( x \leq 0 \), both inequalities are unlikely to hold simultaneously, especially \( x^2 < x \).
- For \( x > 0 \), inequalities can be analyzed via quadratic inequalities.

We'll use Python code to enumerate candidate \( x \)-values on a small grid, check the inequalities, and output the exact solutions.

```python
# Enumerate sample x-values to approximate the solution set
import numpy as np

# Define the range to check, this is small to keep tokens low
x_values = np.linspace(-2, 2, 1000)

# Store solutions that satisfy inequalities
solutions = []

for x in x_values:
    if (x/2) < x**2 < x:
        # Collect both approximate and exact solutions where possible
        solutions.append(x)
        print(f"Candidate x: {x}")

# Since the inequalities are quadratic, solve analytically:
# 1) x^2 > x/2  => x^2 - x/2 > 0
# 2) x^2 < x  => x^2 - x < 0

# Find roots of x^2 - x/2 = 0 => x(x - 1/2) = 0 => x=0 or x=1/2
# For x^2 - x < 0 => x(x - 1) < 0 => x in (0,1)

# Intervals satisfying both:
# x in (0, 1/2) (since x in (0,1/2) satisfies both inequalities)

# Let's print these intervals explicitly
print("The solution set is all x in (0, 0.5)")
```
