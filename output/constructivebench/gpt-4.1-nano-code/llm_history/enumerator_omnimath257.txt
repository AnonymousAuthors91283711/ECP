The problem appears to involve a logical equivalence about the existence of certain functions \(a:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}\) satisfying specific conditions, related to a parameter \(n > 1\). We want to analyze when such functions exist, and produce candidate \(n\) values that satisfy the given criteria. Since the problem is abstract and likely about the existence of sequences with particular properties, an effective approach is to try small \(n\) values and see whether the conditions can be met.

The core idea: For fixed small \(n\), attempt to find an explicit example of \(a(k)\) functions that satisfy the constraints, or summarize which \(n\) are candidates for solutions based on the pattern observed.

Because the problem involves an equation over all \(k \in \mathbb{N}\), and involves sums over ranges, we can focus on small \(n\) values and simple \(a(k)\) sequences to test feasibility.

Let's choose \(n\) from 2 up to a small threshold (say 10), then check whether the conditions seem satisfiable.

```python
# Enumerate n from 2 to 10 to check for candidates where the conditions might hold
# Conditions:
# 1. There exists a function a: ℕ → ℤ with all a(k) ≠ 0
# 2. For all k, sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i+1) * a((i+1)*k) = 0
# We'll attempt to construct simple sequences for small n

def check_candidate(n, max_k=10):
    # Try simple constant sequence a(k) = C ≠ 0
    for C in [1, -1, 2, -2]:
        # For each k, compute sum over i
        valid_for_all_k = True
        for k in range(1, max_k+1):
            total = 0
            for i in range(n):
                index = (i+1)*k
                total += (i+1) * C
            if total != 0:
                break
        else:
            # Found a uniform sequence satisfying the sum condition
            return True
    return False

omnimath257_answer = set()
for n in range(2, 11):
    if check_candidate(n):
        print(f"n = {n} might satisfy the conditions.")
        omnimath257_answer.add(n)

# Print the set of candidate n values
print("Candidates for n:", sorted(omnimath257_answer))
```
