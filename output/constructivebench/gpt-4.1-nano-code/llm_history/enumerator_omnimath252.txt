This problem involves analyzing the Diophantine equation: \(x^2 + xy + y^2 = \left(\frac{x + y}{3} + 1\right)^3\). The theorem claims that the solutions \((x, y)\) are exactly those in the union of two sets, one parametrized by \(n \in \mathbb{Z}\) with a certain function, and the other by a different parametric form.

To assist in conjecturing and verifying the solutions, I will write a Python program that:

- Enumerates small integer pairs \((x, y)\).
- Checks the equation for each pair.
- Attempts to find solutions matching the parametric forms given.
- Prints each solution when found to help hypothesis formation.

Since the problem involves integer solutions, and the equation involves both quadratic and cubic terms, an efficient approach is to limit the search to a small range around zero (say \(-20\) to \(20\)). We focus on understanding the solution structure rather than exhaustively searching the infinite sets.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate small integer pairs (x, y) to analyze solutions to the equation:
# x^2 + xy + y^2 = ((x + y) / 3 + 1)^3

# We analyze for integer solutions in a limited range

import math

def main():
    solutions = []

    # Set search bounds
    min_val, max_val = -20, 20

    for x in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
        for y in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
            sum_xy = x + y
            # Check if (x + y) divisible by 3 to avoid fractions
            if sum_xy % 3 != 0:
                continue
            rhs = ((sum_xy // 3) + 1) ** 3
            lhs = x**2 + x*y + y**2
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"Solution found: x={x}, y={y}")
                solutions.append((x, y))
    # Attempt to identify parametric solutions
    # For small n, check if solutions fit given forms
    # Form 1: (x, y) = (n, ?), or similar.
    # Form 2: (-n^3 + 3n +1, n^3 + 3n^2 -1)

    # Verify form 2 solutions
    for n in range(-10, 11):
        x2 = -n**3 + 3*n + 1
        y2 = n**3 + 3*n**2 - 1
        sum_xy2 = x2 + y2
        if sum_xy2 % 3 != 0:
            continue
        rhs2 = ((sum_xy2 // 3) + 1) **3
        lhs2 = x2**2 + x2*y2 + y2**2
        if lhs2 == rhs2:
            print(f"Parametric form 2 solution at n={n}: x={x2}, y={y2}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code:

- Checks all integer pairs \((x, y)\) in \([-20, 20]\).
- Only tests pairs where \(x + y\) is divisible by 3 (since the RHS involves \(\frac{x+y}{3}\) and the cube).
- Prints solutions that satisfy the original equation.
- Checks the parametric form for potential matches, helping recognize the structure of solutions.

The output will help conjecture the proposed parametric solutions and possibly discover new solutions within the small bounds, supporting proof or further analysis.
