The problem involves analyzing the expression:

\[
\frac{16!}{(4!)^4 \times 24} \times (4 \times 3)^4
\]

and finding the greatest integer \( r \) such that

\[
\frac{16!}{(4!)^4 \times 24} \times (4 \times 3)^4 = 3^r \times M
\]

with \( M \) not divisible by 3, i.e., the highest power of 3 dividing this expression.

Let's analyze step-by-step:

- \( (4 \times 3)^4 = 12^4 \)
- Prime factorization of factorials and calculation of powers of 3 within numerator and denominator.

Efficiently, we can compute the highest power of 3 dividing numerator and denominator separately, then combine.

```python
# Compute the exponent of 3 in n! using Legendre's formula
def exponent_of_prime_in_factorial(n, p):
    count = 0
    divisor = p
    while divisor <= n:
        count += n // divisor
        divisor *= p
    return count

# Calculate the exponent of 3 in the numerator and denominator
# numerator: 16! * 12^4
# denominator: (4!)^4 * 24

# Exponent of 3 in 16!
exp_16_fact = exponent_of_prime_in_factorial(16, 3)

# Exponent of 3 in 4!
exp_4_fact = exponent_of_prime_in_factorial(4, 3)

# Exponent of 3 in 24
# 24 = 2^3 * 3, so 3^1
exp_24 = 1

# Exponent of 3 in numerator:
# 16! -> exp_16_fact
# 12^4 -> since 12 = 2^2 * 3, exponent of 3 in 12 is 1
exp_12 = 1
exp_num = exp_16_fact + 4 * exp_12

# Exponent of 3 in denominator:
# (4!)^4 -> 4! has exp_4_fact
# 24 has exp_24
exp_den = 4 * exp_4_fact + exp_24

# Net exponent of 3 in the entire expression:
# numerator minus denominator
net_exp_3 = exp_num - exp_den

print("Exponent of 3 in numerator:", exp_num)
print("Exponent of 3 in denominator:", exp_den)
print("Net exponent of 3 in expression:", net_exp_3)

# The greatest r is the net exponent of 3
# and M contains no factor of 3
r = net_exp_3
print("The greatest r for which the expression equals 3^r * M with M not divisible by 3:", r)
```
