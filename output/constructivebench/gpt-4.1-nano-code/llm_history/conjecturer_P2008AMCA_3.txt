abbrev P2008AMCA_3_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2008AMCA_3 : 
  (2/3 * 10 : ℚ) / 8 = (1/2 * 5 : ℚ) / P2008AMCA_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: P2008AMCA_3_answer = 3.0000000000000004
. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Given the numerical pattern, the ratio simplifies to \( \frac{\frac{2}{3} \times 10}{8} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \times 5}{x} \). Solving yields \( x = 3 \). Therefore, the answer in closed form: <<<3>>>
