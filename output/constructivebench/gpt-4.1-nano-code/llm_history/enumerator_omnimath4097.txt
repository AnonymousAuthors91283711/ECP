The problem involves analyzing the function \( A(a,b,c) = \frac{2 - a^3}{a} + \frac{2 - b^3}{b} + \frac{2 - c^3}{c} \) under the constraints \( a, b, c > 0 \) and \( a + b + c = 3 \). We are asked to find the least value of \( y \) such that there exist positive \( a, b, c \) satisfying these conditions. 

Observations:
- \( A(a,b,c) \) is symmetric in \( a, b, c \).
- For fixed sum \( a + b + c = 3 \), the minimum of \( A \) likely occurs at symmetric points \( a = b = c \) because of symmetry and convexity considerations.
- Let’s consider the symmetric point: \( a = b = c = 1 \). Then,
  \[
  A(1,1,1) = 3 \times \frac{2 - 1^3}{1} = 3 \times (2 - 1) = 3 \times 1 = 3.
  \]

Next, we should check whether \( A \) can go lower for other positive triplets summing to 3:
- If we try to deviate from symmetry, for example, make \( a \) small and \( c \) large while keeping the sum fixed:
  
  Take \( a \to 0^+ \):
  - \( a \to 0^+ \Rightarrow \frac{2 - a^3}{a} \to \frac{2}{a} \to +\infty \). So \( A \to +\infty \).

- Try making two variables small and one large:
  - For example, \( a = \varepsilon \to 0^+ \), \( b = \varepsilon \to 0^+ \), then \( c = 3 - 2 \varepsilon \to 3 \).

  Compute \( A \):
  \[
  A(\varepsilon, \varepsilon, 3 - 2 \varepsilon) \approx \frac{2 - \varepsilon^3}{\varepsilon} + \frac{2 - \varepsilon^3}{\varepsilon} + \frac{2 - (3 - 2 \varepsilon)^3}{3 - 2 \varepsilon}
  \]

  As \( \varepsilon \to 0^+ \):
  \[
  \frac{2 - 0}{\varepsilon} = \frac{2}{\varepsilon} \to +\infty
  \]

Thus, the minimal value cannot be approached by degenerate points where some variables tend to zero; \( A \) tends to infinity there.

Now, what about the symmetric point \( a = b = c = 1 \)? Is it a minimum?
- The function is symmetric and smooth. The first derivatives at \( a = b = c = 1 \) likely vanish, and second derivatives suggest a minimum.
- Testing some variations:

Suppose \( a = 1 + \delta, b = 1 - \delta/2, c = 1 - \delta/2 \), for small \( \delta \), keeping \( a + b + c = 3 \).

Calculate \( A \):
\[
A(a,b,c) \approx 3 \times (2 - (1 + \delta)^3)/ (1 + \delta)
\]

Since \( (1 + \delta)^3 = 1 + 3 \delta + 3 \delta^2 + \delta^3 \),
\[
2 - (1 + 3 \delta + 3 \delta^2 + \delta^3) = 1 - 3 \delta - 3 \delta^2 - \delta^3
\]

Dividing by \( 1 + \delta \):
\[
\frac{1 - 3 \delta - 3 \delta^2 - \delta^3}{1 + \delta} \approx (1 - 3 \delta - 3 \delta^2 - \delta^3)(1 - \delta)
\]
\[
 \approx 1 - 3 \delta - 3 \delta^2 - \delta^3 - \delta + 3 \delta^2 + 3 \delta^3 + \delta^4
\]
\[
\approx 1 - 4 \delta + 0 + 2 \delta^3 + \text{higher order terms}
\]

At \(\delta = 0\), the value is 1; thus, \(A(1,1,1) = 3 \times 1 = 3\).

Any deviation leads to higher values, indicating a local minimum at the symmetric point.

**Conclusion:**
- The minimal value of \( A \) for positive \(a, b, c\) summing to 3 is \( 3 \), achieved at \( a=b=c=1 \).

Therefore, the answer:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]

# focusing on symmetric points, to find the minimal value of A.
# The symmetry suggests the minimum at a = b = c = 1, with A = 3.

import math

def A(a, b, c):
    return (2 - a**3)/a + (2 - b**3)/b + (2 - c**3)/c

# Exact symmetric candidate

value = A(a, b, c)
print(f"a=b=c=1, A={value}")  # should print 3

# Check approximate minimal configuration near symmetric point
# For small perturbation delta

a = 1 + delta
b = c = 1 - delta/2
approx_value = A(a, b, c)
