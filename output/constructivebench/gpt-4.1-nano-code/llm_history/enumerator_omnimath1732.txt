The problem appears to involve finding integer triples \((a, b, c) \) such that the set \(\{ \frac{a + b}{2} + c, \frac{a + c}{2} + b, \frac{b + c}{2} + a \}\) equals \(\{42, 13, 37 \}\). To explore solutions, we note that each element must be an integer, so the variables must satisfy integrality constraints, and the set equality suggests specific assignments.

Here's an approach:
- Generate all permutations of \(\{42, 13, 37\}\).
- For each assignment, set the expressions equal to the assigned values.
- Solve for \(a, b, c\) while ensuring all are integers.

We'll manually iterate through permutations and solve the resulting equations.

```python
import itertools

# List of target set values
targets = [42, 13, 37]

# Store solutions in a set to avoid duplicates
solutions = set()

# Generate all permutations of the target set
for perm in itertools.permutations(targets):
    s1, s2, s3 = perm
    
    # Equate expressions to assigned targets:
    # (a + b)/2 + c = s1
    # (a + c)/2 + b = s2
    # (b + c)/2 + a = s3

    # Convert to linear equations:
    # a + b + 2c = 2*s1
    # a + 2b + c = 2*s2
    # 2a + b + c = 2*s3

    # Form the coefficient matrix and RHS vector
    # Using Cramer's rule or systematic elimination

    # Matrix:
    # | 1  1  2 |   |a|   = | 2*s1 |
    # | 1  2  1 |   |b|     | 2*s2 |
    # | 2  1  1 |   |c|     | 2*s3 |

    import numpy as np
    coef = np.array([
        [1, 1, 2],
        [1, 2, 1],
        [2, 1, 1]
    ])
    rhs = np.array([2*s1, 2*s2, 2*s3])

    det = np.linalg.det(coef)
    if abs(det) < 1e-9:
        continue  # Singular matrix, skip

    solution = np.linalg.solve(coef, rhs)
    a, b, c = solution

    # Check integrality
    a_int, b_int, c_int = round(a), round(b), round(c)
    if (abs(a - a_int) < 1e-9 and
        abs(b - b_int) < 1e-9 and
        abs(c - c_int) < 1e-9):
        # Verify the set equality
        val1 = (a_int + b_int)//2 + c_int
        val2 = (a_int + c_int)//2 + b_int
        val3 = (b_int + c_int)//2 + a_int
        result_set = {val1, val2, val3}
        if result_set == set(targets):
            solutions.add((a_int, b_int, c_int))
            print(f"Solution: (a, b, c) = ({a_int}, {b_int}, {c_int}) with permutation {perm}")

# If needed, find and print the extremal solutions
# For example, minimum value of a
if solutions:
    min_a = min(s[0] for s in solutions)
    print(f"Minimum a: {min_a}")
    max_a = max(s[0] for s in solutions)
    print(f"Maximum a: {max_a}")
```
