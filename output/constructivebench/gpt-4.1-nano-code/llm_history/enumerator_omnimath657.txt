The problem involves a sum over five nested ranges involving Fibonacci numbers, equated to a specific linear combination of Fibonacci numbers with parameters `(n₁, n₂, n₃, n₄, n₅, n₆)`. The sum resembles the expansion of a multinomial involving Fibonacci numbers and appears to relate to binomial coefficients or combinatorial identities. Given the symmetry and binomial-like coefficients in the coefficients (1, -5, 10, -10, 5, -1), these are the binomial coefficients for `(a - b)^5`.

The sum over `i₁..i₅` of `fib(i₁ + i₂ + i₃ + i₄ + i₅)` simplifies to a sum over the total sum of indices because `fib` depends on their sum. Specifically, for fixed total `S = i₁ + i₂ + i₃ + i₄ + i₅`, the count of `k`-tuples with sum `S` is `combinations_with_repetition`.

The sum over all `i_j`:

```
∑_{i₁=0}^{100} ... ∑_{i₅=0}^{100} fib(i₁ + i₂ + i₃ + i₄ + i₅)
```

can be rewritten as:

```
∑_{S=0}^{500} fib(S) * number_of_solutions(S)
```

where `number_of_solutions(S)` = number of non-negative integer solutions to `i₁ + i₂ + i₃ + i₄ + i₅ = S` with each `i_j` ≤ 100.

For small S, this count is:

`min(S, 500 - S) * C( S + 4, 4 )`, considering the bounds with a correction factor.

But since 100 is large enough for S ≤ 500, for S ≤ 100, the count is simply `C(S + 4, 4)` because the upper bound doesn't restrict the count. For S > 100, the count decreases as some solutions violate the `i_j ≤ 100` constraint, which applies only when `S > 500`.

Given the problem's parameters, to keep things manageable, we can directly compute the sum assuming the unconstrained counts (since `S` won't be near the bounds for small sums).

Let's proceed with the enumeration of small parameter values, focusing on the core linear combination:

The coefficients in the right-hand side are binomial coefficients of `(a - b)^5`. Recognizing this pattern, the simplified sum might relate to `fib(n1) - 5 * fib(n2) + 10 * fib(n3) - 10 * fib(n4) + 5 * fib(n5) - fib(n6)` and be connected to the sum of `fib(S)` multiplied by counts.

To affirm plausible solutions, we'll pick small values for `n_i` (from 1 to 10) and evaluate the sum of `fib(n_i)` and match it with approximate computed sums, examining potential solutions.

The code will:
- Pick small `n_i` values.
- Compute the RHS.
- Enumerate all possible combinations where the parameters satisfy the sum.
- Check if the sum matches the sum over Fibonacci numbers.
- Stream answers immediately.
