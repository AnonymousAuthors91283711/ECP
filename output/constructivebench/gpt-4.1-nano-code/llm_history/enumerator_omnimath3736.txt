The problem appears to involve finding triples of positive primes \( p, q, r \) satisfying the condition:

\[
\frac{r^2 - 5 q^2}{p^2 - 1} = 2
\]

Given the form, it's natural to iterate over small primes for \( p, q, r \), checking the divisibility and the equation.

Approach:
- Loop over small primes for \( p \) and \( q \), since large values are unlikely here.
- Calculate \( r^2 \) from \( r^2 = 2(p^2 - 1) + 5 q^2 \) derived from the equation.
- Check if \( r^2 \) is a perfect square with integer \( r \).

This captures all plausible solutions up to a small threshold.

```python
import math

# Generate small primes for p, q, r
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Generate small primes up to limit
limit = 50
primes = [n for n in range(2, limit + 1) if is_prime(n)]

answers = []

for p in primes:
    for q in primes:
        numerator = 2 * (p**2 - 1) + 5 * q**2
        r_square = numerator
        r_floor = int(math.isqrt(r_square))
        if r_floor * r_floor == r_square:
            r = r_floor
            if r in primes:
                answers.append((p, q, r))
                print((p, q, r))
```

**Explanation:**

The original program attempts to find triples \((p, q, r)\) with all positive primes \(p, q, r\) such that 

\[
\frac{r^2 - 5q^2}{p^2 - 1} = 2,
\]
which leads to:
\[
r^2 - 5q^2 = 2(p^2 - 1) \Rightarrow r^2 = 2(p^2 - 1) + 5q^2.
\]

The code searches for integer \(r^2\) solutions by:

- Fixing small prime \(p, q\),
- Computing numerator \(2(p^2 - 1) + 5q^2\),
- Checking if it is a perfect square,
- Then verifying if \(r\) is prime.

However, the problem is: The code only considers small primes up to 50, which may be insufficient to find solutions, especially if valid solutions involve larger primes. Additionally, the solution checks only for perfect squares of the numerator, which is correct, but it may be missing solutions because:

- The bounds are too small.
- The particular numerator value doesn't match any perfect squares within the checked primes.
- No solutions are found within the limited search space.

Furthermore, the original theorem involves a set defined by a specific relation with primes \(p, q, r\), but the code does not explicitly search across larger ranges or ensure all conditions are met beyond initial prime selection and perfect square checking.

Given the problem structure, and the fact that the code outputs no solutions, the core issue is its limited search scope.

**Decision:**

- Since the code terminates with no answers and the answer set in the theorem might be non-empty, the program fails to find potential solutions.
- The code should be accepting if it correctly enumerates solutions, but here it produces nothingâ€”we cannot confirm the existence of solutions within the small range.
- To properly find solutions, the search space needs to be expanded, or the approach needs adjusting.

**Conclusion:** The original program is rejected because it does not find solutions within the limited range, and the problem likely expects more extensive enumeration.

---

**Corrected Program:**

- Increase the prime limit significantly.
- Include checks for larger primes.
- Print all solutions found.
- Comply with the structure of enumerating and streaming results.

**Explanation:**

The given problem appears to involve finding positive primes \( p \) and \( q \), and a positive integer \( r \), satisfying the relation:

\[
\frac{r^2 - 5q^2}{p^2 - 1} = 2
\]

with the constraints \( p, q, r > 0 \) and primes \( p, q \). The code snippet and assertion are essentially placeholders (`sorry`) with no implementation, and the enumerated answers are missing because there's no code.

The instructions specify that the program should search for tuples \((p, q, r)\) satisfying the relation, print each solution immediately, and in a way that allows us to verify whether solutions are correct.

Given the typical difficulty of directly solving this algebraically, a practical approach is to:

- Fix small prime values for \( p \) and \( q \),
- Derive the required value of \( r \),
- Check if \( r \) is a positive integer,
- If so, output the solution.

This brute-force enumeration of small primes is feasible since the problem asks for a manageable search with small parameters.

**My judgment:**

The original code is entirely missing, so it definitely does not produce outputs or solve the problem. Therefore, **the code should be rejected**.

    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

# Search small prime pairs p, q
for p in range(2, 20):
    if not is_prime(p):
        continue
    for q in range(2, 20):
        if not is_prime(q):
            continue
        denom = p**2 - 1
        numerator = 2 * denom + 5 * q**2
        # Check if numerator divisible by denom
        if numerator % denom == 0:
            r_squared = numerator // denom
            r = int(math.isqrt(r_squared))
            if r > 0
