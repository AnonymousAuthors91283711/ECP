Given the exponential equation \( x^n - y^n = 2^{100} \) with \( x, y > 0 \) and \( n > 1 \), the pattern suggests focusing on small \( n \) and powers of 2. Since \( 2^{100} \) is a large power of 2, solutions only occur when \( n = 2 \), giving the difference of two perfect powers. For \( n=2 \), \( x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y) = 2^{100} \). As \( x, y > 0 \), the factors \( (x - y) \) and \( (x + y) \) are positive. Both must be powers of 2 with \( (x + y) > (x - y) \). Set:

\[ x - y = 2^k, \quad x + y = 2^{100 - k} \Rightarrow \]

\[ \Rightarrow x = \frac{2^k + 2^{100 - k}}{2}, \quad y = \frac{2^{100 - k} - 2^k}{2} \]

for \( 0 < k < 100 \). These are integers because \( 2^k + 2^{100 - k} \) and their difference are even. 

Thus, the total number of solutions for \( n=2 \) is \( 99 \) (for \( k=1 \) to \( 99 \)), and no solutions exist for \( n > 2 \).

Final count: 99 solutions.

<<<99>>>
