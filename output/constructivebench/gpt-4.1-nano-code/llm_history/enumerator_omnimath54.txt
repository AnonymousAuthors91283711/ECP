The problem appears to be a specialized mathematical statement involving least upper bounds related to certain integer sets within specified bounds, likely tied to combinatorial or number-theoretic properties. The key aspects involve finding the minimal integer m such that for any two different sets a, b within the interval [1, 2n-1], there exist integers x, y (not both zero) satisfying certain divisibility and addition constraints.

Since the theorem involves minimal bounds and divisibility conditions within finite intervals, we can approach this by testing small values of n and for each potential m, check whether the conditions can be satisfied for all pairs a, b within the set.

Given the problem's complexity, a practical way to explore solutions is to:
- Choose small n (e.g., n=2, 3, 4)
- For each n, iteratively test candidate m starting from small values upwards
- For each pair a, b in [1, 2n-1], check whether the conditions hold
- Once a candidate m is found where the conditions are met for all pairs, output that m as the minimal answer

Below is a Python program that performs this enumeration for small values of n and searches for the minimal m satisfying the given constraints.

```python
# Enumerate possible minimal m for the theorem for small n
# For each n, we try increasing m until the property holds for all pairs a,b

def check_conditions(n, m):
    # a, b in [1, 2n-1], a != b
    interval = range(1, 2*n)
    for a in interval:
        for b in interval:
            if a != b:
                # Check if there exist x, y satisfying:
                # - not both zero
                # - 2*n divides a*x + b*y
                # - x + y <= m
                found = False
                for x in range(-(m+1), m+2):  # small search bounds
                    for y in range(-(m+1), m+2):
                        if not (x == 0 and y == 0):
                            divisor_condition = (a * x + b * y) % (2 * n) == 0
                            sum_condition = (x + y) <= m
                            if divisor_condition and sum_condition:
                                found = True
                                break
                    if found:
                        break
                if not found:
                    return False
    return True

max_n = 4  # small n for enumeration
for n in range(2, max_n + 1):
    m = 1
    while True:
        if check_conditions(n, m):
            print(f"For n={n}, minimal m = {m}")
            break
        m += 1
```
