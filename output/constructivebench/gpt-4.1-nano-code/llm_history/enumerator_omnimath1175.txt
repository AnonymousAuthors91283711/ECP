The problem involves enumerating functions from Fin 2010 to (Fin 2 → Fin 2), with a certain property that for some c in Fin 2, a composed fold over the list of functions evaluates to c for all x in Fin 2. Essentially, we're counting how many such functions produce a constant function after summing their compositions, and then relating that count to the cardinality of such function space.

To approach this, I will:
- Fix small sample parameters and enumerate all possible functions `fs`.
- For each, check if there exists a c in Fin 2 such that the sequence `List.ofFn fs` folded with composition results in the constant function c.
- Count such functions and output each candidate count immediately.

This is feasible because the total number of functions `Fin 2010 → (Fin 2 → Fin 2)` is enormous, but many can be pruned using the properties of constant functions, significantly reducing computational load.

```python
import itertools

# Small parameters for manageable enumeration
n = 4  # Reduce from 2010 to a small number for the sake of enumeration
domain = range(n)
codomain = [0, 1]

def compose(f, g):
    return lambda x: f(g(x))

def is_constant_func(fs_list):
    # Check if folded composition is constant function
    c0 = fs_list[0](0)
    c1 = fs_list[0](1)
    for f in fs_list[1:]:
        if f(c0) != c0:
            return False
        if f(c1) != c1:
            return False
    # After folding, the result is the composition of all functions
    # For the constant check, just ensure that all functions agree on both inputs
    # Actually, folding with composition yields a function; check if it's constant
    # by comparing f(0) and f(1)
    # But since we fold with composition, the final function is the composition of all fs
    # Let's compute the final composed function
    def composed(x):
        result = x
        for f in reversed(fs_list):
            result = f(result)
        return result
    # Check if composed is constant
    return composed(0) == composed(1)

# Generate all possible functions from domain to codomain
all_fs = []
for values in itertools.product(codomain, repeat=n):
    fs_list = [lambda x, v=v: v for v in values]
    all_fs.append(fs_list)

candidate_counts = set()
for fs_list in all_fs:
    if is_constant_func(fs_list):
        candidate_counts.add(1)

# Output each candidate count
for count in sorted(candidate_counts):
    print(count)
```
