. Enumerated answers: Total 24th roots: 24
Number of roots with (z^6).im = 0: 12. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The roots with (z^6).im = 0 are precisely those where z^6 is real, i.e., z^6 = 1, -1, i^2, -i^2, i^3, -i^3, etc., but since z^24=1, roots with real z^6 are the 12 24th roots of unity where z^(6k) = ±1. The count is 12.
