The variables represent counts satisfying pairs of equations derived from survey questions. From the equations:
- t + a = q1Yes (22)
- a + l = q2Yes (15)
- t + l = q3Yes (9)
Adding all three: 2(t + a + l) = q1Yes + q2Yes + q3Yes = 22 + 15 + 9 = 46, so t + a + l = 23. Since t + a = 22, l = 1. Then t = 22 - a, with a computed from the equations. The only consistent non-negative solution with these sums gives t = 7.
