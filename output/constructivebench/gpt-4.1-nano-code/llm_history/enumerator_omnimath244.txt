The problem appears to involve finding the maximum N (or a greatest element) of a certain set related to pairs of integers, where the key condition involves a property of the determinants formed from pairs. The set includes all N for which there exists an injective family of 100 pairs, and the value N equals the size of a set of pairs with a specific determinant property.

Because the actual set counts involve determinants being equal to 1, reminiscent of coprime pairs or unimodular matrices, and the number 100 suggests a small enumeration is feasible.

Given the constraints, I will:
- Generate capital pairs with small entries
- Check the determinant condition
- Count the number of such pairs
- Vary parameters to find the maximum N

The code will:
- Generate candidate pairs with small positive integers
- For each set of pairs, verify the determinant condition
- Keep track of the maximum count

Since the reasonable approach here limits to small values, I will perform a straightforward search over small pairs.

```python
# Enumeration to find the maximum N such that there exists an injective family of 100 pairs with the determinant condition
# We will limit to small positive integers for efficiency and simplicity
# The goal: Find the largest number of pairs satisfying the condition, and outputs it immediately when found

def generate_pairs(limit):
    # Generate pairs with entries from 1 to limit
    pairs_list = []
    for a in range(1, limit + 1):
        for b in range(1, limit + 1):
            pairs_list.append((a, b))
    return pairs_list

max_N_found = 0
# We attempt with small maximum value for entries to keep runtime feasible
for max_entry in range(1, 10):  # small limit for quick testing
    pairs_candidates = generate_pairs(max_entry)
    total_pairs = len(pairs_candidates)
    # Check all subsets of size 100
    from itertools import combinations
    for subset in combinations(pairs_candidates, 100):
        # Construct the set of pairs
        # Compute the number of pairs that satisfy the determinant == 1 condition
        count = 0
        for p1 in subset:
            for p2 in subset:
                if p1 != p2:
                    det = p1[0]*p2[1] - p2[0]*p1[1]
                    if abs(det) == 1:
                        count += 1
        if count == 100 * (100 - 1):  # all pairs satisfy, i.e., perfect
            # N equals the total number of pairs in the set
            N = len(subset)
            print("Found maximum N =", N, "with entries up to", max_entry)
            # Update maximum
            if N > max_N_found:
                max_N_found = N
# Output the maximum N found
print("Maximum N found:", max_N_found)
```
