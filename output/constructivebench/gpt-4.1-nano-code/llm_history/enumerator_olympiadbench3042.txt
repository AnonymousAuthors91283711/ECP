The problem appears to involve finding the maximum sum `s` over an arithmetic progression with parameters `a` (initial term) and `d` (difference), where:

- All terms are ≤ 999
- No larger difference `d' > d` can satisfy the bounds with any `a'`
- Summing the first 15 terms: `∑_{k=0}^{14} (a + k * d)`

To find the greatest possible sum, we need to find the largest `a` and `d` satisfying the constraints.

**Approach:**
- Since `a + 14d ≤ 999`, the maximum `a` for a given `d` is `a ≤ 999 - 14d`.
- Larger `d` increases the last term, so possibly more sum, but the initial `a` may be smaller.
- We must find the maximum sum over feasible `(a, d)`.

**Implementation:**
- Decide on small integer ranges for `d`.
- For each `d` starting from largest feasible to smallest, find maximum `a`.
- Calculate the sum, output each candidate result immediately.

```python
# Enumerate possible values for d from largest to smallest feasible
max_d = 999 // 14  # maximum difference based on the constraint a + 14d ≤ 999
for d in range(max_d, 0, -1):
    a_max = 999 - 14 * d
    # For this d, the maximum starting point a is a_max
    a = a_max
    # Calculate sum of arithmetic progression: sum = 15/2 * (2a + 14d)
    s = 15 * (2 * a + 14 * d) // 2
    print(s)
```
