The pattern indicates that all solutions are linear or constant functions with specific coefficients, notably multiples of 0, ±1, or fixed constants. The relation transforms into conditions satisfied exactly when f is constant or linear with slopes 0 or ±1, and constants from the set {-10, -5, 0, 5, 10}. Since the question asks for an answer set that encompasses all solutions matching the pattern, the closed form in ℝ → ℝ is the union of these functions.

The enumerated solutions reveal that the solutions are either constant functions with values in {-10, -5, 0, 5, 10} or linear functions with slopes in {-1, 0, 1} and arbitrary constants. The key insight is that these functions satisfy the relation involving differences and quadratic terms, consistent with the patterns observed.

Given the enumeration, the set of solutions can be expressed as the union of two types:

1. Constant functions: \(f(x) = c\) for \(c \in \{-10, -5, 0, 5, 10\}\),
2. Linear functions with slopes in \(\{-1, 0, 1\}\) and arbitrary constants.

Therefore, in Lean, the set can be formalized as:

\[
\{f : ℝ → ℝ \mid f \text{ is constant with value } c \in \{-10, -5, 0, 5, 10\}\} \cup \left\{f \mid \exists m \in \{-1, 0, 1\}, b \in ℝ, f(x) = m \cdot x + b \right\}
\]

The actual representation in Lean would be a union of two sets: constants and linear functions with these slopes.

The key is to express the set of solutions as either constant functions with values in {-10, -5, 0, 5, 10} or affine linear functions with slopes in {-1, 0, 1} and arbitrary constants. 

In Lean, constant functions can be represented as functions that always return a fixed value c in the set. For the linear functions, we specify functions α(x) = m * x + b with m ∈ {-1, 0, 1} and b ∈ ℝ.

Hence, the set can be expressed as the union of these two types:

- For the constant functions: \( \{ λ x, c | c ∈ \{-10, -5, 0, 5, 10\} \} \)
- For the linear functions: \( \{ λ x, m * x + b | m ∈ \{-1, 0, 1\}, b ∈ ℝ \} \)

Putting together in Lean syntax:

<<< (λ c : ℝ, c) '' { c | c ∈ {-10, -5, 0, 5, 10} } ∪

The current proposed answer tries to define a set of functions by taking images of certain sets under functions, but there's a syntax error at the comma within the set comprehension syntax. In Lean, element-wise definitions of sets of functions should use set comprehension with the 'set.of_fun' or proper set notation, and the syntax for set comprehension is `{ x | condition }`, not `{ x | condition, ... }` with comma-separated elements in the condition.

The enumerated solutions suggest the answer set includes:

- Constant functions with values in {-10, -5, 0, 5, 10},
- Linear functions of the form f(x) = m * x with m ∈ {-1, 0, 1}.

From the pattern, the final answer should be the union of:

1. Constant functions `λ c, const c` for c in {-10, -5, 0, 5, 10},
2. Linear functions `λ m, λ x, m * x` for m in {-1, 0, 1}.

In Lean, the set of constant functions with values in a finite set can be represented as:

```lean
{ λ c, λ _, c | c ∈ {-10, -5, 0, 5, 10} }
```

Similarly, the set of linear functions with fixed slopes:

```lean
{ λ m, λ x, m * x | m ∈ {-1, 0, 1} }
```

The union of these two sets gives the total set, which corresponds exactly to the enumerated answers.

Thus, the corrected answer in Lean syntax (using set comprehension with `set_of`) is:

<<<{ λ c, λ _, c | c ∈ {-10, -5, 0, 5, 10} } ∪ { λ m, λ x, m * x | m ∈ {-1, 0, 1} }>>>

This is both syntactically correct and aligned with the enumeration, capturing all solutions listed.

**Explanations:**  
- Used proper set comprehension syntax `{ | }` with the '|' operator.  
- The constant functions are represented as functions returning a fixed value `c`, parameterized over `c` in the finite set.  
- The linear functions are functions where the output is `m * x`, with `m` in the finite slope set.  
- The union captures all constant and linear solutions found.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error arises because in Lean, set notation using curly braces `{}` expects elements or comprehension forms, and the current syntax `{ λ c, λ _, c | c ∈ {-10, -5, 0, 5, 10} }` is invalid. Specifically, it mixes a lambda notation directly with set notation without proper comprehension or element structure, and signs like `| c ∈ ...` are not valid within curly braces.

From the enumerated answers and patterns, the set includes constant functions and linear functions. The constant solutions are functions `f(x) = c` with `c` among {-10, -5, 0, 5, 10}. The linear solutions are functions `f(x) = c * x` with `c` in {-1, 0, 1}.

The proper way in Lean to define this set is via set comprehension, that is, using `Set.ofList` or set comprehension syntax, for instance:

```lean
{ λ x, c } for constant functions, or 
{ λ x, c * x } for linear functions, and combining these sets.

Since we want to include all such functions, the set will be the union of:
- constant functions with constants in {-10, -5, 0, 5, 10}
- linear functions with slopes in {-1, 0, 1}

This is formalized as:

```lean
def omnimath3904_answer : Set (ℝ → ℝ) := 
  { f | ∃ c, f = λ x, c ∧ c ∈ {-10, -5, 0, 5, 10} } ∪
  { f | ∃ c, f = λ x, c * x ∧ c ∈ {-1, 0, 1} }
```

or, in a more compact way, as a set of functions:

```lean
set of all functions of the form λ x, c or λ x, c * x with c in the specified constants.  

Here's the total form in Lean:

```lean
abbrev omnimath3904_answer : Set (ℝ → ℝ) := 
  (consts : Set (ℝ → ℝ)) ∪ (lin : Set (ℝ → ℝ))
where
  consts := { λ x, c | c ∈ {-10, -5, 0, 5, 10} }
  lin := { λ x, c * x | c ∈ {-1, 0, 1} }
```

Alternatively, directly:

```lean
abbrev omnimath3904_answer : Set (ℝ → ℝ) :=
  (λ c : ℝ, λ x, c) '' {-10, -5, 0, 5, 10} ∪
  (λ c : ℝ, λ x, c * x) '' {-1, 0, 1}
```

Conclusion: To fix the syntax error, define `omnimath3904_answer` as a union of sets constructed via the `''` notation for image sets, which maps finite sets of constants to functions, or explicitly define as set comprehensions with existential quantifiers.

**Final answer in Lean:**
```lean
<<< (λ c : ℝ, λ x : ℝ, c) '' {-10, -5, 0, 5, 10} ∪ (λ c : ℝ, λ x, c * x) '' {-1, 0, 1} >>>
