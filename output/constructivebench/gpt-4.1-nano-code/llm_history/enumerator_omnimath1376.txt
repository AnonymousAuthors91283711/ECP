The problem appears to involve a functional equation over the rationals, with the key condition:

\[ f(x) + f\left(1 - \frac{1}{x}\right) = \log |x| \]

for all \( x \in \mathbb{Q} \setminus \{0, 1\} \). The goal is to determine \( f(x) \) explicitly, likely involving some form of symmetry or transformation.

To assist, we'll explore possible solutions by enumerating candidate functions aligned with known functional equations and their symmetries. For rational numbers, considering some representative points and symmetry relations helps.

Since the problem is about Emmy-like conjecture and pattern-finding, we'll:

- Pick sample rationals \(x\) (like 2, -1, 1/2, etc.).
- Use the given relation to solve for \(f(x)\).
- Implement an iterative approach to generate potential solutions.
- Due to the problem's symmetry, before attempting complex solutions, I'll test principal rational points and their images under the transformation \( x \mapsto 1 - \frac{1}{x}\).

Here's the code with basic enumeration of specific candidate points.

```python
# Enumerate some rational points and attempt to find f(x) based on the functional equation
# Note: the approach is heuristic and aims to uncover potential solutions to assist conjecture

# Possible rational points to test
test_points = [2, -1, 1/2, 3, -1/3, 4/5]

# Store known values for f(x) at these points to observe patterns
# Since the problem is underdetermined, assume some initial values and solve
# The key relation: f(x) + f(1 - 1/x) = log|x|

# Helper function to compute candidate f(x) assuming f at some points
def compute_f_candidates():
    results = {}
    for x in test_points:
        # Compute corresponding point under the symmetry
        y = 1 - (1 / x)
        # f(x) + f(y) = log|x|
        # Try to assign arbitrary f(x) and deduce f(y) or vice versa
        # For simplicity, assume f at some points is zero and solve for others
        # For initial estimation, assume f(x)=0 for all x except one
        # Then f(y) = log|x| - f(x)
        f_x = 0
        f_y = (log_abs(x) - f_x)
        # Store the tentative values
        results[x] = {'f(x)': f_x, 'f(y)': f_y, 'x': x, 'y': y}
        print(f"For x={x}: potential f(x)={f_x}, f({y})={f_y}")
    return results

from math import log, isclose

def log_abs(x):
    return log(abs(x))

# Run the candidate computation
compute_f_candidates()

# Note: Due to underdetermined nature, the true f may involve arbitrary additive constants.
# The core idea: solutions are constrained by symmetry and the functional equation.
```

This code enumerates some rational points and infers possible values for \(f\), aiding pattern recognition. Further exploration would involve solving these systems for explicit formulas, but for the competition's purpose, this initial enumeration is sufficient to formulate conjectures.
