[write_program]
This problem defines a Fibonacci-like sequence with initial conditions f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, and recurrence f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n â‰¥ 3. The goal is to find f(2018). Since Fibonacci numbers grow very rapidly, a direct recursive or iterative approach to compute f(2018) is most efficient for a small script.

Given the problem's constraints, I will generate Fibonacci numbers iteratively up to n=2018 and print the result when reached. No need for approximation; exact integer arithmetic in Python handles this efficiently. We will just iterate through the sequence once.

Here's the Python program to compute f(2018):

```python
# Since f(n) follows the Fibonacci sequence with f(1)=1 and f(2)=1,
# we can iteratively compute to n=2018.
def compute_fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 1, 1  # f(1) and f(2)
    for _ in range(3, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b

# Compute and print f(2018)
answer = compute_fibonacci(2018)
print(answer)
```
