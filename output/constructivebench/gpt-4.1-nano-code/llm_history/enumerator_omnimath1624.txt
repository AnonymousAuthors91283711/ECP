The problem involves exploring possible solutions for the sum of probabilities \( P_i \) and the product \( 1 - \prod(1 - P_i) \), given \( P_i \in [0,1] \). The constraints suggest examining sums and products for different \( m \) and \( P_i \) values. Since the problem is high-school level, small \( m \) values are sufficient for enumeration.

We will:
- Consider small \( m \) (from 1 to 4).
- Generate all possible combinations of \( P_i \) within [0, 1] with increments of 0.25 for simplicity.
- For each combination, check the sum and product constraints.
- Print each valid answer immediately as it's found.

This approach helps approximate the possible values for the sum and the quantity \( 1 - \prod(1 - P_i) \).

```python
import itertools

# Define the range of probabilities from 0 to 1 with step 0.25
prob_values = [i/4 for i in range(5)]

# Enumerate m from small values, e.g., 1 to 4
for m in range(1, 5):
    # Generate all combinations of P_i values
    for P in itertools.product(prob_values, repeat=m):
        if any(p < 0 or p > 1 for p in P):
            continue  # outside bounds, skip
        sum_P = sum(P)
        prod_terms = 1
        for p in P:
            prod_terms *= (1 - p)
        # Check constraints:
        # sum of P_i
        sum_valid = abs(sum_P - round(sum_P, 8)) < 1e-8
        # compute 1 - product
        one_minus_prod = 1 - prod_terms
        # For each combination, print the sum and 1 - product
        print(f"m={m}, P={P}, sum={sum_P:.2f}, 1 - prod={one_minus_prod:.4f}")
```
