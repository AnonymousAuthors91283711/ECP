The pattern suggests N divisible by 5, positive, and P N < 321/400; the sum of digits equals 12. The candidate N is likely 20, as N = 20 yields N/5=4, sum of binomial coefficients for i=0..8, leading to P N, with sum of digits 1+2=3, but matching constraints. Given the pattern, the minimal N satisfying these is 20. Therefore, the answer is 20.
