This problem involves polynomials A and B satisfying a certain functional equation involving their evaluations at x ≠ 0, −10, and x ≠ 0. The key is to analyze the condition:

1 / A(x) + 1 / B(x) + 1 / (x + 10) = 1 / x

Our goal: enumerate possible polynomials A, then compute the sum of A(10) for all such A.

**Approach:**

- Rewrite the equation to relate A, B: Find a relation for A and B from the equation.
- Since the equation involves rational functions, and A, B are polynomials, reasonable small degrees are considered.
- We suspect A is quadratic with leading coefficient 1 (from the condition). Similarly for B.
- We'll first set A(x) to be monic quadratic: A(x) = x^2 + a x + b.
- For each candidate A, determine possible B that satisfy the condition.
- Because this is a symbolic problem, and we're asked to enumerate solutions, the code will iterate over plausible small integer coefficients for A.
- For each A, derive B(x) from the equation, then verify the polynomial condition.

**Note:** Since the problem statement is abstract—no concrete data—the code will generate candidate polynomials A, derive B, check the condition, and output A(10).

```python
# Enumerate monic quadratic polynomials A(x) = x^2 + a x + b with small integer coefficients
# For each A, derive B(x) = 1 / (1 / x - 1 / A(x) - 1 / (x + 10))
# Check that B is a polynomial (no poles) and satisfies the condition
# Print A(10) for each candidate A

for a in range(-5, 6):
    for b in range(-5, 6):
        def A(x):
            return x ** 2 + a * x + b
        # Attempt to derive B(x) from the given equation
        # 1/A + 1/B + 1/(x+10) = 1/x
        # => 1/B = 1/x - 1/A - 1/(x+10)
        # Let's build 1/B as a rational expression and check if B is polynomial
        def B_expr(x):
            numerator = A(x) * (x + 10) - A(x) * x - x * (x + 10)
            denominator = x * (x + 10) * A(x)
            # Simplify numerator
            num = A(x)*(x+10) - A(x)*x - x*(x+10)
            # Check if numerator is divisible by denominator to get polynomial B
            # As a rough check, compute numerator polynomial
            return numerator / denominator if denominator != 0 else None
        # Verify B(x) is polynomial by testing if numerator is divisible by denominator
        # For small integer coefficients, numerator should be polynomial and divisible
        # Since numerator and denominator are symbolic, we check over several x to see if B is polynomial
        test_points = [1, 2, -1, -2, 3]
        valid = True
        B_vals = []
        for x in test_points:
            try:
                val = B_expr(x)
                B_vals.append(val)
            except:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid and all(isinstance(val, (int, float)) for val in B_vals):
            # For small coefficients, assume B is polynomial if B_expr is polynomial
            # Now, evaluate A(10) and print
            print(A(10))
