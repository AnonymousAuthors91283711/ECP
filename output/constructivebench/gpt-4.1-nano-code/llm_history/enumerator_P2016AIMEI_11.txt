The problem involves a polynomial P with specific properties:
- It is non-zero.
- It satisfies the functional equation: (X - 1) * P(comp(X + 1)) = (X + 2) * P.
- The polynomial evaluates equally at 2^2 and 3, i.e., P(4) = P(3).
- We are asked to find P evaluated at 7/2.

This resembles a polynomial functional equation, suggesting P might be a polynomial of certain degree satisfying this relation. Since P ≠ 0 and involves composition, a good starting point is to assume a polynomial degree and attempt to find all possible solutions. Because the problem looks like an algebraic characterization, we can test low-degree polynomial candidates and verify the conditions.

Let's try degrees 0, 1, 2, 3, ... and see if any candidate P meets the conditions, especially the evaluation points.

        # The equation: (X - 1) * P(comp(X + 1)) = (X + 2) * P
        # For simplicity, test at several values to see if possible
        # But more directly, since it's an identity, check for all x
        # According to the problem, P comp(X+1) and the functional equation holds identically
        # So, substitute and equate coefficients
        P_comp = P.subs(x, sp.Function('X_plus_1')(x))
        # Here, symbolic composition is complex; instead, we test at specific points

            # For P in linear form, P(comp(1)) depends on comp(1)
            # But comp(x+1) = x+1, so no composition?

            # Assume composition: P(P(x+1)), or P of something else? 
            # Likely, P.comp(x+1) means P evaluated at x+1.
            # So, functional equation: (X - 1)*P(x+1) = (X + 2)*P
            # which can be checked at specific points.
            #
            # Let's check at x=0:

            rhs = (0+2)*(a1*0 + a0)

            rhs_val = 2*a0
            # Condition: lhs_val = rhs_val
            # -1*(a1 + a0) = 2 a0 => -a1 - a0 = 2 a0 => -a1=3 a0
            # Also, P(4)=P(3):

                # From earlier: -a1=3 a0
                # With a1=0, then 0=3 a0 => a0=0
                # So P=0, disallowed
                continue
            # Thus, no non-zero linear polynomial satisfies both conditions
        # Continue for higher degrees similarly; for brevity, skip and check known solutions.

# Known solutions suggest that the polynomial is of degree 2 or less.
# Based on experience, try P=constant and linear forms:

# Next, test quadratic solutions explicitly.

# Let's attempt to find P explicitly by assuming degrees 1 and 2.

# For brevity, directly try to find candidate polynomials matching conditions.

# Attempt polynomial form P(x) = c*(x - r)^k, maybe an eigenfunction of the functional operator.

# so, P(comp(x+1)) = P(x+1)

# Collect coefficients for powers of x
