The problem involves finding prime numbers p for which there exists a pair (x,y) in Fin p × Fin p such that p divides y² - x³ - 4x, and the number of such solutions modulo p equals p itself. This likely suggests all possible solutions over finite fields where the polynomial has many solutions, possibly all pairs.

To assist, we can enumerate small primes, check for each prime p whether the number of solutions (x,y) satisfying y² = x³ + 4x mod p is equal to p, and output such primes.

Here's a program that enumerates small primes, counts solutions, and outputs those primes where the count matches the prime itself:

```python
# Enumerate small primes p up to a limit, count solutions to y^2 ≡ x^3 + 4x mod p
# and print primes where the number of solutions equals p.

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def count_solutions(p):
    count = 0
    for x in range(p):
        rhs = (x**3 + 4*x) % p
        # Count y's such that y^2 ≡ rhs mod p
        for y in range(p):
            if (y*y) % p == rhs:
                count += 1
    return count

primes_found = []
limit = 50  # small limit for feasible enumeration
for p in range(2, limit):
    if is_prime(p):
        sol_count = count_solutions(p)
        print(f"Prime p={p}, solutions={sol_count}")
        if sol_count == p:
            print(f"Answer prime: {p}")
            primes_found.append(p)

# Set of all such primes (answers)
omnimath995_answer = set(primes_found)
print(f"Answer primes: {sorted(omnimath995_answer)}")
```
