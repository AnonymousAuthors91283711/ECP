theorem omnimath3799 :
  {n : ℕ | n ≥ 1 ∧ ∃ k : ℤ, k^2 = n * 2^(n+1) + 1} = omnimath3799_answer :=
sorry
. Enumerated answers: n = 3, value = 49, perfect square of k = 7. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Because n=3 yields n*2^(n+1)+1=3*2^4+1=3*16+1=49=7^2, and pattern suggests n=3 is the unique solution, the set is {3}.  
Final answer: <<<{3}>>>
