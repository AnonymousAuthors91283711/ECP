The problem asks to find the ratio (as a rational number) of "good palindromes" (palindromes divisible by 11 and also palindromes) to all 6-digit palindromes. To enumerate, we need to:

- Generate all 6-digit palindromes: these are of the form `abc cba` (digits).
- Count how many are palindromes.
- Count how many of those are divisible by 11.
- Compute the ratio.

Let's generate 6-digit palindromes explicitly via their first three digits (`a`, `b`, `c`), then verify divisibility by 11. We will output each palindrome that is divisible by 11.

```python
# Generate all 6-digit palindromes and count those divisible by 11.
# 6-digit palindromes: form a b c c b a where a in [1..9], b,c in [0..9]
# For each such palindrome, check divisibility by 11.
palindromes = []
good_palindromes = []

for a in range(1, 10):  # leading digit cannot be zero
    for b in range(10):
        for c in range(10):
            palindrome = 100000*a + 10000*b + 1000*c + 100*c + 10*b + a
            palindromes.append(palindrome)

total_palindromes = len(palindromes)
print(f"Total 6-digit palindromes: {total_palindromes}")

# Now, check for divisibility by 11 and print each.
for n in palindromes:
    if n % 11 == 0:
        good_palindromes.append(n)
        print(n)

# Calculate the ratio of good palindromes to total.
ratio = len(good_palindromes) / total_palindromes
print("Ratio of good palindromes to all 6-digit palindromes:", ratio)
```
