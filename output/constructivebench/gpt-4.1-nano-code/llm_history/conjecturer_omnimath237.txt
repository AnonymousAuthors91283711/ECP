abbrev omnimath237_answer : Set (Int × Int × Int) := sorry
theorem omnimath237 (a b c : Int) :
    a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = a^2 * b^2 ↔ (a, b, c) ∈ omnimath237_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found solution: (0, 0, 0). Expected Answer Type: Set (Int × Int × Int)
The only solutions satisfy a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = a^2 * b^2, which simplifies under integer assumptions to the set {(0,0,0), (0, x, 0), (x, 0, 0)} where x is any integer, given the trivial cases when a or b are zero. No other integer solutions exist.
