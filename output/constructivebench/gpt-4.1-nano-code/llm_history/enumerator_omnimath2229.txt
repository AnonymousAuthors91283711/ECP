The problem involves a polynomial \( P \) with integer coefficients, bounded coefficients, and known polynomial evaluations at 10 and -10. We want to find \( P(1) \). To do this, we can attempt to reconstruct \( P \) from the given evaluations using interpolation, considering the constraints on coefficients, and then compute \( P(1) \).

Since the coefficients are between 0 and 99, and the polynomial evaluations at Â±10 are known, a feasible approach is to consider potential polynomial forms compatible with these constraints and derive \( P(1) \).

I'll implement a brute-force candidate enumeration over possible coefficients, white-list combinations consistent with the evaluated results, and then output \( P(1) \). To keep computation feasible, I'll restrict degree guesses to small degrees (e.g., degree 2 or 3), considering the problem context and the provided data.

```python
# Enumerate possible quadratic polynomials P(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c
# with coefficients 0 <= a,b,c < 100
# Using given values: P(10)=331633, P(-10)=273373
# For each candidate (a, b, c), check if they satisfy the constraints
# and compute P(1) = a + b + c.

            # Check if the candidate satisfies the evaluations
            if a*100 + b*10 + c == 331633 - (a*10*10 + b*10 + c) and \
               a*100 + b*(-10) + c == 273373 - (a*10*10 - b*10 + c):
                # Use the equations directly
                P_10 = a*10*10 + b*10 + c
                P_neg10 = a*10*10 - b*10 + c
                if P_10 == 331633 and P_neg10 == 273373:
                    P_1 = a*1 + b*1 + c
                    print(P_1)
                    answers.add(P_1)

    print("No solutions found with quadratic assumption.")
