This problem involves analyzing a set of candidate integers and summing those for which \(a^6 \nmid 6^a\). We need to find the sum of all such candidates. The key is to determine for each candidate whether \(a^6\) divides \(6^a\). Since \(6^a = (2 \times 3)^a = 2^a \times 3^a\), we check if the prime factorization of \(a^6\) is "contained" within \(6^a\).

Given the set of candidates, we only need to test divisibility conditions based on prime exponents:

- For \(a^6 | 6^a\), the prime exponents in \(a^6\) must be less than or equal to those in \(6^a\).
- This breaks down into prime factors 2 and 3: 

If \(a = 2^x \times 3^y \times \text{(other primes)}\), then:
- \(a^6 = 2^{6x} \times 3^{6y} \times \text{(other primes)}\)
- \(6^a = 2^a \times 3^a\). 

For divisibility:
- \(6x \leq a\) for 2-exponent
- \(6y \leq a\) for 3-exponent

But to simplify testing each candidate, we note that if \(a\) contains prime factors other than 2 and 3, then \(a^6\) contains those prime factors to some power, but \(6^a\) doesn't, so divisibility fails. Therefore, for candidates composed of primes 2 and 3, the check reduces to simple exponent comparisons.

Below is a code that iterates through all candidates, checks the divisibility condition, and sums those for which the divisibility does **not** hold.

```python
# List of candidates
candidates = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 27, 32, 36, 48, 54, 64, 72,
              81, 96, 108, 128, 144, 162, 192, 216, 243, 256, 288, 324, 384, 432,
              486, 512, 576, 648, 729, 768, 864, 972}

# Function to determine if a number's prime factors are only 2 and 3
def prime_factors_only_2_and_3(n):
    while n % 2 == 0:
        n //= 2
    while n % 3 == 0:
        n //= 3
    return n == 1

total_sum = 0
for a in candidates:
    # Check if a's prime factors are only 2 and 3
    if not prime_factors_only_2_and_3(a):
        # For other primes, a^6 does not divide 6^a
        total_sum += a
    else:
        # For powers of 2 and 3 only, check the divisibility condition
        # Factor a into powers of 2 and 3
        x, y = 0, 0
        temp = a
        while temp % 2 == 0:
            temp //= 2
            x += 1
        while temp % 3 == 0:
            temp //= 3
            y += 1
        # Check for each prime if 6x <= a and 6y <= a
        # Since a = 2^x * 3^y, a = 2^x * 3^y
        # For divisibility, need 6x <= a and 6y <= a considering prime exponents
        # But with prime factorization, the actual test is:
        # a^6 divides 6^a if and only if 6x <= a and 6y <= a
        # Because 6^a has exponents a for 2 and 3.
        # Convert a to integer from exponents:
        a_int = a
        if 6 * x > a_int or 6 * y > a_int:
            total_sum += a

print(total_sum)
```
