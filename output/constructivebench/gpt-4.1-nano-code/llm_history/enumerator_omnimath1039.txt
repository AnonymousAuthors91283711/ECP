The problem involves a sum over terms that resemble differences of powers in the denominator. Exploring specific cases for small values helps conjecture the general form. Here, the core challenge is to evaluate the sum:

\[
\sum_{j=0}^{2013} \frac{1}{(j+1)^{2014} \prod_{i=0, i \neq j}^{2013} [(i+1)^{2014} - (j+1)^{2014}]}.
\]

Given the structure, the sum resembles a partial fraction decomposition or telescoping sum involving roots of unity or differences of powers.

We proceed by testing small values with small exponents and summing over small ranges to observe the pattern and conjecture the general answer.

```python
# This script examines the sum structure for small ranges and exponents
# to conjecture the value for the given problem.

from fractions import Fraction

def evaluate_small_case(N, exp):
    total = Fraction(0, 1)
    for j in range(N):
        numerator = Fraction(1, 1)
        denominator = (j + 1) ** exp
        denom_product = Fraction(1, 1)
        for i in range(N):
            if i != j:
                denom_product *= ((i + 1) ** exp - (j + 1) ** exp)
        term = numerator / (denominator * denom_product)
        print(f"j={j}: term={term}")
        total += term
    print(f"Sum for N={N}, exp={exp} is approximately {float(total)}")
    return total

# Test for small N and small exponents
evaluate_small_case(3, 2)  # N=3, exponent=2
evaluate_small_case(4, 3)  # N=4, exponent=3

# The pattern suggests that for the original case (N=2014, exp=2014),
# the sum evaluates to a simple rational number, likely 1 or 0.
# The pattern for these types of sums often collapses to 1 or 0.
