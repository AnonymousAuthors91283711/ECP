noncomputable abbrev omnimath1006_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1006 (θ : ℝ) (hθ : 0 < θ ∧ θ < π / 2) :
    let x := cos θ
    let y := sin θ
    arccos ((4 * x + 3 * y) / 5) = θ ↔ tan θ = omnimath1006_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: For θ=0.3218 radians, tan θ=0.3333, matches the expression
Answer (∼): 0.3333. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Since the given data suggests the answer is approximately 1/3 and the pattern in the enumerated answer aligns with a simple rational number, the expression most consistent with the pattern and the example is \( \frac{1}{3} \).  

<<<(1/3)>>>
