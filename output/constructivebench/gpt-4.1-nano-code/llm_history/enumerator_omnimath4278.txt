This theorem involves finite sets of integers indexed by 100 elements, with certain nonempty intersection properties and divisibility conditions on the cardinalities of intersections. The key points include the nonemptiness of the intersections and a divisibility condition related to the number of elements in these intersections.

To help conjecture the minimal value `n` satisfying the given conditions, I will consider a simplified model with small parameters: only 3 sets, to understand how the intersection sizes and divisibility interplay. I'll systematically enumerate possible sizes for the intersection corresponding to some element `x` shared across subsets, focusing on the minimal cardinality `n` where a large enough subset exists (≥ 50, but since we're working with small simulated data, I will use smaller thresholds).

The approach:
- Use small sample values for the number of sets and their intersection sizes.
- Generate all subsets of the 3 sets, compute their intersections.
- For each element, check if the intersection size is ≥ a certain threshold desired.
- Record the minimal such `n`.

This provides insights into how the intersection sizes affect the minimal `n` satisfying divisibility and nonempty intersection conditions.

```python
# Enumerate possible intersection sizes for small index sets and find minimal n with intersection size >= 1
# for a simplified model: 3 sets with sample intersection sizes. Focus on shared elements.

from itertools import combinations

# Example sets (simulated, small)
S_sizes = [20, 30, 25]  # sizes of individual sets S0, S1, S2
# Assume intersections are constructed for the small model
# Generate all possible intersection sizes for the 3 sets
possible_intersections = []

# For simplicity, consider intersection sizes from 1 up to min set size
for size00 in range(1, min(S_sizes) + 1):
    for size01 in range(1, min(S_sizes) + 1):
        for size02 in range(1, min(S_sizes) + 1):
            for size12 in range(1, min(S_sizes) + 1):
                for size012 in range(1, min(S_sizes) + 1):
                    # Check if the sizes are consistent (not strictly necessary in this simplified model)
                    # For demonstration, just record combinations meeting arbitrary conditions
                    # For example, intersections could satisfy certain divisibility or minimal size
                    total_shared = min(size012, size00, size01, size02)
                    # Record if total_shared ≥ 1 (nonempty)
                    if total_shared >= 1:
                        possible_intersections.append(total_shared)

# Find the minimal intersection size that meets the threshold (e.g., ≥ 1)
min_n = min(possible_intersections)
print("Minimal intersection size (simulated):", min_n)
