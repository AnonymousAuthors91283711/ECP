. Enumerated answers: 154. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the decimal digit relationship y = 10 * (x % 10) + (x / 10), with restriction 10 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, and x^2 - y^2 = m^2, the problem effectively involves two two-digit numbers with digits x1 x0 and y1 y0, where y is the reverse of x, leading to x + y + m satisfying a pattern.

From the enumeration, and for the plausible symmetric solutions, the pattern suggests that the sum x + y + m always equals 154.

Thus, the closed-form answer is:

<<<154>>>
