[write_program]
The problem is somewhat abstract, involving solving a linear equation with specific parameters. To facilitate conjecture, I'll write a Python script that examines candidate lines y = m*x + b with m = -5 and b = -3, then evaluates the corresponding y values for various x within a small range. It will print each candidate y value immediately, prioritize exact solutions, and cover the simplest case.

```python
# Enumerate candidate values for x in a small range
for x in range(-10, 11):
    # Given m and b as per problem statement
    m = -5
    b = -3
    y = m * x + b
    print(f"x = {x:2d}, y = {y}")
```
