The problem aims to find the greatest natural number n less than 2012 such that for every divisor d of n, the representation of d in base 2 has at most 2 ones in its binary expansion. To assist in conjecture formation, we will enumerate candidate values of n below 2012, check the divisor condition, and identify the greatest that satisfies it.

Steps:
- For each n in descending order from 2011 to 1:
  - Find all divisors d of n.
  - Convert d to binary and count the number of '1'S.
  - If all divisors satisfy the at most 2 ones condition, output n and stop.
  
This code prioritizes finding the maximum n satisfying the condition by starting from the top.

```python
def has_at_most_two_ones_in_binary(n):
    return bin(n).count('1') <= 2

def divisors(n):
    divs = []
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divs.append(n // i)
    return divs

for n in range(2011, 0, -1):
    d_list = divisors(n)
    if all(has_at_most_two_ones_in_binary(d) for d in d_list):
        print(n)
        break
```
