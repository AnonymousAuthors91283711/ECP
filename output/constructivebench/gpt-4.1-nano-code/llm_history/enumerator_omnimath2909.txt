This problem appears to involve a family of 9 variables with specific constraints, and asks for the least `u` satisfying those constraints given `n`. The constraints relate sums of triples of variables, with some equalities. To assist, I will:
- Select small `n` values (e.g., `n=0, 1, 2...`),
- Generate all candidates for `a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,u` satisfying the equalities,
- For each candidate, check the conditions, and note the minimal `u`.
- Print all such `u`s (streaming results).

Considering the complexity and the constraints, and aiming for efficiency, I will:
- Fix `n` and enumerate `a,b,c` within small ranges,
- Derive `d,e,f,g,h`, and check if they meet the sum conditions,
- Track the minimal `u`.

Here's the code:

```python
# The code enumerates possible solutions for n, a, b, c within small bounds,
# then finds the minimal u satisfying the constraints.

def main():
    results = {}
    max_range = 20  # limit for variables to keep computations feasible
    for n in range(0, 5):  # sample small n values
        min_u = None
        # Iterate over small values for a, b, c
        for a in range(max_range):
            for b in range(max_range):
                for c in range(max_range):
                    sum_abc = a + b + c
                    # Derive d, e, f, g, h, u from constraints:
                    # 1) a + b + c = d + e + f
                    # 2) a + b + c = g + h + u
                    # 3) a + b + c = c + f + u
                    # 4) a + b + c = a + e + h
                    # Express some variables:
                    # From 3: a + b + c = c + f + u => a + b = f + u
                    # From 4: a + b + c = a + e + h => b + c = e + h
                    # From 1: d + e + f = sum_abc
                    # From 2: g + h + u = sum_abc
                    # Also, f = a + b - u (from 3)
                    # e + h = b + c
                    # Then pick u to satisfy f >= 0, e >=0, h >=0, g >=0, d >=0
                    for u in range(max_range):
                        f = a + b - u
                        if f < 0:
                            continue
                        e_plus_h = b + c
                        # Since e + h = e_plus_h, e, h >=0
                        # Try all split of e_plus_h into e and h
                        for e in range(e_plus_h + 1):
                            h = e_plus_h - e
                            # Now determine g and d
                            g = sum_abc - h - u

                                # We have a candidate solution
                                # Validate constraints:

                                # 3) a + b + c == c + f + u (by derivation)
