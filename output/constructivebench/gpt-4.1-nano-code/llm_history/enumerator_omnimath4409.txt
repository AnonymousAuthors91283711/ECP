This problem likely asks us to find all real numbers x such that 3 * x^3 - floor(x) = 3. To enumerate solutions, we'll consider the problem in terms of the integer part (floor(x)) and fractional part, then check for solutions within a reasonable range.

We will:
- Loop over possible integer parts n within a small range (say -10 to 10).
- For each n, solve 3x^3 = 3 + n, i.e., x^3 = (3 + n)/3 = 1 + n/3.
- Then find real solutions for x = cbrt(1 + n/3).
- Check if with that x, floor(x) == n.
- Print all solutions that satisfy the condition.

This approach captures possible solutions efficiently without unnecessary calculations.

```python
import math

# Enumerate possible integer parts n within a small range
for n in range(-10, 11):
    rhs = 1 + n/3  # The value inside the cube root
    # Skip if rhs is negative and fractional when cube root can handle negatives
    x_approx = math.copysign(abs(rhs) ** (1/3), rhs)  # cube root
    # Check if x satisfies the original equation: 3*x^3 - floor(x) ==3
    if abs(3 * x_approx ** 3 - n - 3) < 1e-9:
        # Verify floor(x) == n
        if math.floor(x_approx) == n:
            print(x_approx)
```
