The problem appears to be asking for the greatest natural number \( n \) such that when multiplied by the volume of a sphere of radius 4 (using the volume formula \(\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\)), it does not exceed the volume of a sphere of radius 10, i.e.,

\[
n \times \frac{4}{3} \pi 4^3 \leq \frac{4}{3} \pi 10^3
\]

Simplifying, the constants \(\frac{4}{3} \pi\) cancel out, so we need:

\[
n \times 4^3 \leq 10^3
\]

which means:

\[
n \times 64 \leq 1000
\]

or

\[
n \leq \frac{1000}{64}
\]

Calculating \(\frac{1000}{64}\):

\[
\frac{1000}{64} = 15.625
\]

Because \( n \in \mathbb{N} \), the greatest integer \( n \) satisfying this is 15.

Here's a Python program that enumerates all \( n \) from 1 to 15 and confirms that 15 is the maximum:

```python
# Enumerate n from 1 upwards and identify the greatest n satisfying the inequality
# n * (4/3) * pi * 4^3 <= (4/3) * pi * 10^3
# Simplify constants: n * 64 <= 1000

max_n = 0
for n in range(1, 100):  # loop beyond expected maximum for safety
    if n * 64 <= 1000:
        print(n)
        max_n = n
    else:
        break
print("Greatest n:", max_n)
```
