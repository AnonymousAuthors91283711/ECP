Ground Truth Answer: fun p => (p - 1) / 2
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℕ => p - 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the greatest natural number n such that (X-1)^n divides a specific polynomial q defined over ZMod p.

2. The ground truth answer suggests that the maximal exponent is (p-1)/2.

3. The proposed answer claims it's p-1.

Key observations:
- The polynomial q is constructed using terms involving k^((p-1)/2), which suggests a connection with quadratic residues.
- For prime p, the multiplicity of (X-1) in such polynomials is typically related to (p-1)/2, not p-1.
- The proposed answer of p-1 would imply (X-1)^(p-1) divides q, which seems too strong and unlikely to be true in general.

The proposed answer is incorrect as it overestimates the multiplicity. The ground truth answer of (p-1)/2 is the correct maximal exponent.
