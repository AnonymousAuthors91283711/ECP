[write_program]
The problem appears to involve permutations of a finite set of heights with specific restrictions on adjacent values. The heights are from the set {65, 66, 67, 68, 69}, and the permutation must satisfy that no two adjacent heights differ by exactly 1 in either direction.

To assist in conjecturing and eventually proving the answer, I will write a Python program that:
- Enumerates all permutations of the set {65,66,67,68,69}.
- Checks the adjacency condition: for each consecutive pair, neither difference is exactly 1.
- Counts and outputs all permutations satisfying these conditions.

The program immediately prints each valid permutation as it finds it. It will also report the total count at the end, which can help infer things like the total number of such permutations.

This approach is efficient enough for small permutation sets, complying with the instructions.

```python
import itertools

# Set of heights
heights = [65, 66, 67, 68, 69]
valid_permutations = []

# Enumerate all permutations
for perm in itertools.permutations(heights):
    # Check adjacency condition
    if all(abs(perm[i] - perm[i+1]) != 1 for i in range(len(perm) - 1)):
        # Print the permutation immediately
        print(perm)
        valid_permutations.append(perm)

# Print total number of valid permutations
print(f"Total valid permutations: {len(valid_permutations)}")
```
