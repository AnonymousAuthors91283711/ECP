theorem P2019AMCB_4 : 
  (IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (n+1)! + (n+2)! = n! * 440} 5) ∧ 
  (List.sum (digits 10 5) = P2019AMCB_4_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found n: 19
Sum of digits of 5: 5
Answer: 5. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Because the sum of the digits of 5 is directly given as 5 and the enumeration indicates the only n satisfying the condition is 19, the answer is the sum of digits of n: 1 + 9 = 10, which is inconsistent with the sum of digits of 5.  
However, the reference answer implies the digits sum to 5, matching the explicit value 5.  
Thus, the answer is 5, which matches the enumerated value and the sum of digits of 5.  
Final answer: <<<5>>>
