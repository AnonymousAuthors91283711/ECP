theorem omnimath78 (p q : ℕ) : 
  p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ p * q ∣ 5^p + 5^q ↔ (p, q) ∈ omnimath78_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (2, 3)
(2, 5)
(3, 2)
(5, 2)
(5, 5). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
The pattern suggests pairs where the product divides 5^p + 5^q, specifically with small primes, notably 2, 3, and 5. The pairs satisfying this are (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (5, 2), and (5, 5). The set includes these pairs, reflecting symmetry and special exponent relations.
