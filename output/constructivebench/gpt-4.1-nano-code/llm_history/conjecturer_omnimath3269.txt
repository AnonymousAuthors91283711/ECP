Based on the pattern and the condition involving derivatives and polynomial evaluations, the set likely contains pairs where p and q are polynomials such that their combination yields a constant value 1 after the given transformation. The structure suggests p and q are related to linear polynomials scaled appropriately. The simplest such pair is p(x) = 1 and q(x) = x, which satisfy the required property.
