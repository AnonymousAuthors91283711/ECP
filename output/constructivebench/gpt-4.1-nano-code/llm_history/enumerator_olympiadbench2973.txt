This problem involves permutations with multiple constraints on digits, and we want to find the greatest possible value of a certain sum involving these digits under given conditions.

Key observations:
- Digits are from 0 to 9 inclusive (since Fin 10).
- All these digits are distinct with certain pairs specified as not equal.
- The expression relates the digits: W A D E + A S H, with specific digit constraints.
- The sum simplifies to W * 1000 + 2A * 100 + D * 10 + E + S * 10 + H, which simplifies further or can be computed directly.
- The goal is to maximize `s = D + E`, given the constraints and the total sum equals T = 2030.

Since the constraints are strict and the total sum is fixed, to conjecture the maximum sum, Iâ€™ll generate all possibilities with small sample values, iterate through permutations respecting the constraints, and test whether the sum matches the target T. For efficiency, I will generate candidates that satisfy the sum condition and track the maximum D + E.

Here's a Python program that enumerates all such possibilities:

```python
# Enumerate all permutations of digits 0-9 respecting the constraints and sum condition
import itertools

# Since W, A, D, E, S, H are all digits from 0-9 with constraints
digits = range(10)

max_DE_sum = -1
best_s = None

# We will generate all permutations of W, A, D, E, S, H with constraints
for W, A, D, E, S, H in itertools.permutations(digits, 6):
    # Check constraints
    if len({W, A, D, E, S, H}) < 6:
        continue  # all must be distinct in the set

    # Specific pair inequalities
    if W == A or W == D or W == E or W == S or W == H:
        continue
    if A == D or A == E or A == S or A == H:
        continue
    if D == E or D == S or D == H:
        continue
    if E == S or E == H:
        continue
    if S == H:
        continue

    # Calculate sum: W * 1000 + A * 100 + D * 10 + E + A * 100 + S * 10 + H
    total = W * 1000 + A * 100 + D * 10 + E + A * 100 + S * 10 + H
    if total == 2030:
        s = D + E
        print(f"W={W}, A={A}, D={D}, E={E}, S={S}, H={H}, D+E={s}")
        if s > max_DE_sum:
            max_DE_sum = s
            best_s = s

# After enumeration, print the maximum sum D+E found
if best_s is not None:
    print(f"Maximum D+E: {best_s}")
else:
    print("No solution found.")
```
