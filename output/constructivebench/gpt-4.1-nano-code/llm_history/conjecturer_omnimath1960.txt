. Enumerated answers: 63. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the minimal multiple of 63 with an odd digit sum in base 2 is 63 itself. Since 63 divides itself and the sum of its binary digits (111111) is 6 (even), but the problem states the sum is odd, indicating the need for the next multiple of 63 that meets the criterion. The next multiple of 63 is 126, whose binary digit sum is 4, still even. Next is 189 (3×63). The binary form of 189 has 4 ones, even. 252 (4×63) has binary digit sum 4, even. 315 (5×63) binary form has 5 ones, which is odd, satisfying the condition. Thus, 315 is the least such number.
