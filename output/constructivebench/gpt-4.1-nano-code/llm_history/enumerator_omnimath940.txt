This problem defines a sequence \( a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) with initial condition \( a(1) = 1 \) and a recursive relation for \( n > 1 \):
\[ a(n) = \gcd(a(n-1), n) + 1. \]
We are asked to find \( a(2002) \). To help conjecture the value, we will enumerate the first several terms of the sequence and look for a pattern.

We will:
- Generate sequence terms from \( n = 1 \) up to at least \( n = 20 \).
- Print each term as soon as it is computed.
- Observe the pattern or possible formula.

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

a_value = 1  # initial value a(1)=1
print(f"n=1, a=1")  # output initial term

for n in range(2, 21):
    a_value = gcd(a_value, n) + 1
    print(f"n={n}, a={a_value}")
```
