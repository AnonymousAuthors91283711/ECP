The problem appears to be a mathematical statement involving real and natural numbers, relating to solving the equation \(12 = \frac{1}{2} \times n\) for \(n\), and asserting the uniqueness of the solution among natural numbers.

Given the equation \(12 = \frac{1}{2} \times n\), the only \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) satisfying this is \(n = 24\). The code's structure suggests we need to verify this solution.

The approach:
- Find all natural numbers \(n\) such that \(12 = \frac{1}{2} \times n\),
- Print each such \(n\),
- Confirm that the only such \(n\) is 24, aligning with the theorem's statement.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers to find those satisfying 12 = (1/2)*n
solutions = []
for n in range(0, 50):  # choose an upper bound comfortably above 24
    if abs(0.5 * n - 12) < 1e-8:
        print(n)
        solutions.append(n)

# Verify only n=24 is the solution
# Since we know the exact solution is n=24, check this explicitly
# and state the answer
if solutions == [24]:
    print("Unique solution: n=24")
else:
    print("Solutions found:", solutions)
```
