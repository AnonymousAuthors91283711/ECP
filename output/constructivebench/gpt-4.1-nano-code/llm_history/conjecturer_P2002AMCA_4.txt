. Enumerated answers: Candidate solution: x = 60. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Let's analyze the equation: \( 90 - x = 0.25 \times (180 - x) \). Simplifying:

\( 90 - x = \frac{1}{4}(180 - x) \)

Multiply both sides by 4:

\( 4(90 - x) = 180 - x \)

\( 360 - 4x = 180 - x \)

Bring all to one side:

\( 360 - 4x - 180 + x = 0 \)

\( 180 - 3x = 0 \)

Solve:

\( 3x = 180 \)

\( x = 60 \)

Therefore, the unique solution is \( x = 60 \).

The answer in Lean form is:

<<<60>>>
