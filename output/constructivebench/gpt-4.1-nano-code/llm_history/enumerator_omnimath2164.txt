The problem appears to involve parametrized systems of linear equations, with the goal of finding the value of `c` that makes a certain statement true, expressed via an unknown `omnimath2164_answer`. Given the structure:

\[
\forall b \in \mathbb{R}, \exists x, y \quad \text{such that} \quad
\begin{cases}
a x + b y = c - 1 \\
(a + 5) x + (b + 3) y = c + 1
\end{cases}
\]

The task is to find all `c` values such that for **every** real `b`, such `x, y` exist. So, for each fixed `a`, we want to characterize the set of `c` where the "for all `b`" quantification holds.

---

Observing the system, for fixed `b`, the equations are:

\[
\begin{cases}
a x + b y = c - 1 \\
(a+5) x + (b+3) y = c + 1
\end{cases}
\]

Think about the existence of solutions `(x, y)` for arbitrary `b`. These form a linear system:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
a+5 & b+3
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
c - 1 \\
c + 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

---

To have a solution for **all** `b`, the linear system must be **consistent** for all `b`. The key is the dependence of the coefficients on `b`. Let's analyze:

The coefficients matrix:

\[
M(b) = \begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
a+5 & b+3
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The system has a solution if and only if the augmented vector `(c-1, c+1)` lies in the span of the columns of `M(b)`.

For the **system to be solvable for all `b`**, the matrix must act such that for any `b`, the equations are compatible.

Specifically, the rank condition:

- If the coefficient matrix is invertible for some `b`, then the solution exists uniquely for that `b`. But we need **the solution to exist for all `b`**, which only happens if the equations are **redundant or consistent** identically, i.e., the two equations are either dependent or compatible for all `b`.

---
Let's check when the two equations are linearly dependent:

The matrix rows are:

Row 1: \(a, b\)

Row 2: \(a+5, b+3\)

They are linearly dependent iff

\[
\exists \lambda \text{ such that} \quad (a + 5) = \lambda a,\quad b + 3 = \lambda b
\]

which means:

\[
a + 5 = \lambda a \implies \lambda = 1 + \frac{5}{a} ~~ \text{(if } a \neq 0)
\]
and
\[
b + 3 = \lambda b \implies \lambda = 1 + \frac{3}{b}
\]

Thus, for all `b`, the same \(\lambda\) must satisfy both:

\[
1 + \frac{5}{a} = 1 + \frac{3}{b} \Rightarrow \frac{5}{a} = \frac{3}{b} \Rightarrow 5b = 3a \Rightarrow b = \frac{3a}{5}
\]

But this only holds for specific `b`, not all. Therefore, the rows are **not** linearly dependent for all `b`, unless the coefficients vanish or are compatible for all `b`.

Alternatively, consider the special case:

- When \(a=0\):

Equation 1: \(0 \cdot x + b y = c - 1\)

Equation 2: \(5 x + (b+3) y = c + 1\)

For the existence for **all** `b`, the behavior depends:

- From Eq 1: \(b y = c - 1\)

- From Eq 2: \(5 x + (b+3) y = c + 1\)

If \(a=0\):

Equation 1: \(b y = c - 1\)

To have solutions for all `b`, the only possibility is that the value \(c-1\) is **zero** (so that the right side is independent of `b`), and then \(b y=0\) for all `b`, which is only possible if \(y=0\).

Similarly, check for \(a\neq 0\):

The problem reduces to whether the two equations are consistent for all `b`, which involves the relationships between coefficients.

---

To streamline, a practical computational approach is to test candidate values of `c` for given small values of `a`, and check for all `b` whether the equations are solvable. Since we want an answer independent of the given formula, a brute-force enumeration over small `a` and `c` with sampling over `b` can provide insight.

---

Below is a code that samples small values of `a`, `b`, and candidate `c`, checks whether the system is solvable for each `b`, and if for all sampled `b`, solutions exist, then prints the candidate `c`.

This supports the process of conjecturing the exact `c` values for the problem.

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample small set for parameters to test
a_values = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
b_values = np.linspace(-10, 10, 50)
c_candidates = np.linspace(-10, 10, 100)

for a in a_values:
    for c in c_candidates:
        all_solvable = True
        for b in b_values:
            # Form the coefficient matrix and RHS
            A = np.array([[a, b],
                          [a+5, b+3]])
            rhs = np.array([c - 1, c + 1])
            # Check if the system has solutions
            # Criterion: rank of A equals rank of augmented matrix
            if np.linalg.matrix_rank(A) < np.linalg.matrix_rank(np.column_stack((A, rhs))):
                all_solvable = False
                break
        if all_solvable:
            # For the current a and c, solutions exist for all sampled b
            # Likely candidate; more refined check can be added
            print(f"Candidate c: {c:.2f} for a: {a}")
```
