The problem asks for the minimal n such that any subset T of {1,..,280} with size n contains a 5-element subset of pairwise coprime numbers. The largest such subset avoiding pairwise coprime 5-element subsets would include elements with common prime factors. Since 280 ≈ the product of small primes, the limiting factor is the number of elements that can avoid forming 5 pairwise coprime elements, which grows with the number of prime factors and their multiples. The maximum size of a subset avoiding such a 5-element coprime subset is 55.

Therefore, the least n with this property is 56.

Hence,

<<<56>>>
