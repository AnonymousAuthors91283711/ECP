This problem involves combinatorial calculations with binomial coefficients, likely representing probabilities or proportions of favorable outcomes over total outcomes. To explore the ratio, we'll replace `sorry` parts with code that directly computes these binomial coefficients and their ratios, enumerating specific values for small parameters to verify and assist in conjecturing the answer. 

We will:
- Calculate `total` as given.
- Calculate `valid` as given.
- Output their ratio immediately when computed.
- Use small sample values for the variables involved, for instance, fixing the parameters to small numbers like 4, 2, 6, etc.
- Ensure no extra output and concise enumeration respecting the token limit.

```python
from math import comb

# Select small sample parameters
# Given the original values, we fix:
n1, r1 = 8, 2
n2, r2 = 6, 2
n3, r3 = 4, 2
n4, r4 = 2, 2

# Calculate total as per formula
total = (comb(n1, r1) * comb(n2, r2) * comb(n3, r3) * comb(n4, r4)) / 24
print(f"Total: {total}")

# Calculate valid as per formula
valid = (comb(n3, r3) * comb(n4, r4)) / 2 * (comb(n3, r3) * comb(n4, r4)) / 2
print(f"Valid: {valid}")

# Compute and print the ratio (probability)
answer = valid / total
print(f"Answer: {answer}")
```
