The problem provides a system of three equations involving real variables x, y, z:

1) x = y + z + 2  
2) y = z + x + 1  
3) z = x + y + 4

The goal is to find the value of x + y + z.

Let's analyze the system algebraically:

- From equation (1): y + z = x - 2
- From equation (2): y = z + x + 1
- From (2), substitute y into (1): (z + x + 1) + z = x - 2  
  => z + x + 1 + z = x - 2  
  => 2z + x + 1 = x - 2  
  => 2z + 1 = -2  
  => 2z = -3  
  => z = -3/2

- Now, find y: y = z + x + 1 = (-3/2) + x + 1 = x - 1/2

- Use equation (3): z = x + y + 4  
  Substitute y: (-3/2) = x + (x - 1/2) + 4  
  => -3/2 = 2x - 1/2 + 4  
  => -3/2 = 2x + (4 - 1/2)  
  => -3/2 = 2x + (8/2 - 1/2) = 2x + 7/2

- Solve for x:  
  2x = -3/2 - 7/2 = (-3 - 7)/2 = -10/2 = -5  
  => x = -5/2

- Find y: y = x - 1/2 = (-5/2) - 1/2 = -6/2 = -3

- Find z: z = -3/2 (already known)

Sum: x + y + z = (-5/2) + (-3) + (-3/2)  
Compute: (-5/2) - 3 - 3/2 = (-5/2) - (6/2) - (3/2) = (-5 - 6 - 3)/2 = (-14)/2 = -7

Thus, the sum x + y + z = -7.

We'll set up a Python enumeration to verify this solution, though the algebra already confirms the result. The code will scan small rational candidates around these values for confirmation.

```python
# Enumerate rational candidates around the algebraic solution to verify the result
# We'll test a small grid of values near the algebraic solutions to confirm.

# Known algebraic solutions: x = -5/2, y = -3, z = -3/2, sum = -7

candidates = []
# Define small epsilon for search neighborhood
eps = 0.5

for dx in [-eps, 0, eps]:
    for dy in [-eps, 0, eps]:
        for dz in [-eps, 0, eps]:
            x = -5/2 + dx
            y = -3 + dy
            z = -3/2 + dz
            # Check equations within a tolerance
            tol = 0.01
            cond1 = abs(x - (y + z + 2)) < tol
            cond2 = abs(y - (z + x + 1)) < tol
            cond3 = abs(z - (x + y + 4)) < tol
            if cond1 and cond2 and cond3:
                s = x + y + z
                print(f"Verification candidate: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, sum={s}")
                candidates.append(s)
print("Confirmed sum candidates:", sorted(set(candidates)))
```
