The problem seems to be about finding the greatest natural number \( n \) such that there exists a function `answers : Fin 16 → Fin n → Fin 4` satisfying the property:

> For any two distinct `s1`, `s2` in `Fin 16`, the set of `p` in `Fin n` where `answers s1 p = answers s2 p` has cardinal at most 1. 

This essentially means that for any two distinct elements in `Fin 16`, the functions `answers s1` and `answers s2` agree on at most one position `p` in `Fin n`. In other words, the functions `answers s` are "almost pairwise disjoint" in their images, with at most one overlap.

---

**Reasoning:**

- For two distinct functions `answers s1, answers s2`, their agreement is at most on one `p`.
- Since there are 16 functions (one for each `s` in `Fin 16`), we need a set of functions from `Fin n` to `Fin 4` with the property that any pair of functions shares a single value at no more than one position.

This is reminiscent of a problem in combinatorics related to coding theory or intersecting families.

**Upper bounds consideration:**
- Maximum size of such a family is constrained by overlaps.
- For each pair `(s1, s2)`, their functions "intersect" in at most one position.

---

**Approach:**

- Brute-force enumeration for small values of `n` (say from 1 up to some limit like 16 or 20).
- For each candidate `n`, attempt to construct such a family of `answers`.

---

**Implementation plan:**

- For small `n`, generate all possible functions from `Fin 16` to `Fin 4` (each such function assigns a value in `{0,1,2,3}` to each element in `Fin 16`).
- For efficiency, we won't generate all functions at once; instead, we'll attempt to construct a large family by greedy approach, adding functions that satisfy the property with all previously selected functions.
- Record and print the maximum size `n` for which construction is successful.

---

**Code:**

```python
import itertools

# Generate all functions from Fin 16 to Fin 4 as tuples (length 16 with entries in {0,1,2,3})
all_functions = list(itertools.product(range(4), repeat=16))

# Function to check if a candidate addition satisfies the pairwise overlap property
def compatible(f, family):
    for existing in family:
        overlap_count = sum(1 for a, b in zip(f, existing) if a == b)
        if overlap_count > 1:
            return False
    return True

# Main enumeration
max_n_found = 0
max_family = []

for n in range(1, 17):  # up to 16
    # Collect all functions of length n from the total set.
    # For construction, pick functions from all_functions truncated accordingly.
    # But we need functions from Fin 16 to Fin n: so each function is a tuple of length 16 with entries in {0,...,n-1}
    # Generate all functions from Fin 16 to Fin n
    candidate_functions = []
    for values in itertools.product(range(n), repeat=16):
        candidate_functions.append(values)
    # Greedy construction
    family = []
    for f in candidate_functions:
        if compatible(f, family):
            family.append(f)
    print(f"For n={n}, constructed family size: {len(family)}")
    if len(family) > max_n_found:
        max_n_found = len(family)
        max_family = family
# Output the maximum n and size
print(f"Maximum n with such a family is at least: {n-1}")
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates over small `n` from 1 to 16.
- For each `n`, generates all possible functions from `Fin 16` to `Fin n`.
- Uses a greedy approach to construct the largest family satisfying the "at most one overlap" property.
- Prints family sizes for each `n` to observe the growth.
- Concludes with the maximum detected `n`.

This script helps to approximate the maximal `n`; refined mathematical proof would involve combinatorial bounds, but this enumeration aids in conjecture formation.
