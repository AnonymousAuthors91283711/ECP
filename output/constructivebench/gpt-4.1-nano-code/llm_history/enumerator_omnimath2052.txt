The provided code snippet appears to be written in Lean, a theorem prover language, involving real numbers, propositions, and a statement about a least element satisfying a certain property. Specifically, the property involves the relationship between x and y, with the equation `(y + x) = (y - x)^2 + 3*(y - x) + 3`.

My task is to generate a Python program that enumerates potential answers (values of y) by backing out of this equation to help in conjecturing the least such y. Due to constraints, the program will pick small sample parameters and check candidate y-values for the existence of x satisfying the equation.

Your plan:
- For select small integer y in a reasonable range (e.g., -10 to 10),
- Solve for x in the equation (which is quadratic in x),
- If solutions exist (discriminant â‰¥ 0), print the y and corresponding x solutions,
- Assume the minimal y satisfying this will be the target.

```python
import math

# Enumerate candidate y values in a small range
for y in range(-10, 11):
    # The equation in x: (y + x) = (y - x)^2 + 3*(y - x) + 3
    # Expand and rearrange to quadratic form in x:
    # (y + x) = (y - x)^2 + 3*(y - x) + 3
    # Let z = y - x
    # Then: y + x = z^2 + 3z +3
    # But also: x = y - z
    # Substitute x:
    # y + (y - z) = z^2 + 3z + 3
    # 2y - z = z^2 + 3z + 3
    # Move all to one side:
    # z^2 + 3z + 3 + z - 2y = 0
    # z^2 + 4z + (3 - 2y) = 0
    # Solve for z:
    a_z = 1
    b_z = 4
    c_z = 3 - 2 * y
    discriminant = b_z**2 - 4 * a_z * c_z

    if discriminant < 0:
        continue  # No real solutions for z, hence no real x

    sqrt_disc = math.sqrt(discriminant)
    z1 = (-b_z + sqrt_disc) / (2 * a_z)
    z2 = (-b_z - sqrt_disc) / (2 * a_z)

    # Compute x from z: x = y - z
    x1a = y - z1
    x1b = y - z2

    # For each solution, print the y and corresponding x
    print(f"y = {y}")
    print(f"  Solution x = {x1a}")
    print(f"  Solution x = {x1b}")
```
