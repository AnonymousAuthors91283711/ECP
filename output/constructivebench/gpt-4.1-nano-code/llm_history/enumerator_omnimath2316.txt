The problem involves finding the number of integer triples (a, b, c), each between 1 and 100 inclusive, satisfying the equation:
\[ a^2 b + b^2 c + c^2 a = a b^2 + b c^2 + c a^2 \]
Our goal is to enumerate all such triples and count them (ncard). We will then output the count directly.

Since it's a math problem at the high-school competition level, we will write a Python script to iterate over all triples, check the equation, and count solutions, printing each solution as it's found.

The approach:
- Loop over a, b, c in 1..100
- Check the given equation
- If true, print the triple, increment count
- After enumeration, print the total count

This script prioritizes exact matching and will efficiently handle the enumeration.

```python
# Enumerate all triples (a, b, c) with 1 <= a, b, c <= 100
count = 0
for a in range(1, 101):
    for b in range(1, 101):
        for c in range(1, 101):
            left = a**2 * b + b**2 * c + c**2 * a
            right = a * b**2 + b * c**2 + c * a**2
            if left == right:
                print((a, b, c))
                count += 1
print("Total solutions:", count)
```
