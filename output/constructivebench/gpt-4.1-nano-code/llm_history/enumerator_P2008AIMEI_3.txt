This problem involves solving a system of equations with three variables b, j, s, constrained by two linear equations and one quadratic sum condition. To efficiently enumerate solutions, I will test small integer values of b, j, s within feasible bounds based on the equations, using the first two equations to narrow down candidates, then compute the sum of squares to find the answer.

Here's the plan:
- Because the sums involve 2b, 3j, 4s, and similar with different coefficients, b, j, s are likely small.
- We can loop over small ranges for b, j, s, check the linear equations, then compute the sum of squares.
- For each valid solution, immediately output the sum of squares.
- Focus on solutions with minimal sum of squares, as the problem seems to be asking for an answer in that context.

```python
# Enumerates small integer solutions to the given system and outputs sum of squares for each solution.
# Based on the equations:
# 2b + 3j + 4s = 74
# 4b + 2j + 3s = 91

max_b = 20  # Arbitrary small upper limit based on linear bounds
max_j = 25
max_s = 25

found_sums = []

for b in range(max_b + 1):
    for j in range(max_j + 1):
        for s in range(max_s + 1):
            # Check linear equations
            if 2*b + 3*j + 4*s == 74 and 4*b + 2*j + 3*s == 91:
                sum_squares = b*b + j*j + s*s
                print(sum_squares)
                found_sums.append(sum_squares)
```
