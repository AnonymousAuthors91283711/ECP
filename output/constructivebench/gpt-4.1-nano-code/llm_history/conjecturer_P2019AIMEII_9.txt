theorem P2019AIMEII_9 :
  let S := ∑ n in Finset.Icc 1 2018, if (divisors n).card = 20 ∧ 20 ∣ n then n else 0
  S / 20 = P2019AIMEII_9_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 240 has 20 divisors
n = 560 has 20 divisors
n = 880 has 20 divisors
n = 1040 has 20 divisors
n = 1360 has 20 divisors
n = 1520 has 20 divisors
n = 1840 has 20 divisors
n = 2000 has 20 divisors
Sum over all such n: 9440
Given sum / 20 = 472. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<472>>>
