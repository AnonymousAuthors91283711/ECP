Ground Truth Answer: 1008016
Proposed Answer: (2006 / 2 + 1) * (2006 + 2) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem is counting the number of triples (a,b,c) of natural numbers where:
   - a + b + c = 2006
   - b + c is even

2. The ground truth answer is 1,008,016.

3. The proposed answer is (2006/2 + 1)*(2006 + 2)/2
   - Calculating this: (1003 + 1)*(2008)/2 = 1004*1004 = 1,008,016

The proposed answer simplifies to exactly the same value as the ground truth answer, and the expression correctly represents the combinatorial counting of valid triples under the given constraints.
