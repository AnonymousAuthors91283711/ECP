This is a formal Lean lemma involving natural numbers. The goal appears to be solving for `n` in the equation `8 + 6 = n + 8`. Algebraically, simplifying:

8 + 6 = n + 8  
14 = n + 8  
n = 6

The program should just confirm this deduction through enumeration, printing the answer when found.

```python
# Enumerate possible n values where the equation 8 + 6 = n + 8 holds.
# Since the equation simplifies to n = 14 - 8 = 6, we directly verify this.

for n in range(0, 20):  # checking a reasonable range around the expected value
    if 8 + 6 == n + 8:
        print(n)
        break  # stop after finding the solution
```
