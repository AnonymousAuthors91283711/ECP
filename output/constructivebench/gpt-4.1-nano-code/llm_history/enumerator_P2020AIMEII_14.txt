This problem involves a function \(f(x) = x \times (x - \lfloor x \rfloor)\) defined on the real numbers, where \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) denotes the integer part. The set in question is \(\{x \in [0, 2020] \mid f(f(f(x)))=17\}\), and we need to find \(N\), the cardinality of this set. The optional goal is to find \(N \bmod 1000\).

To assist, I will:
- Explore the behavior of the function \(f\), which acts differently on integer and fractional parts.
- Since \(f(x)\) depends on the fractional part: \(f(x) = x \times (x - \lfloor x \rfloor)\).
- The key is solving the equation \(f(f(f(x)))=17\), which potentially involves multiple iterates.
- Limiting to small sample values and examining periodic behavior of iterates.

The program will:
- Sample points with fractional parts in [0,1), because the function depends only on fractional parts.
- Use iterative maps for small fractional parts.
- Find all solutions near rational approximations or known periodic points.

Here is the code:

```python
import math

# Function to compute f(x) based on fractional part
def f(x):
    int_part = math.floor(x)
    frac = x - int_part
    return (int_part + frac) * frac

# Set parameters
max_iter = 3  # number of iterations to approximate the behavior
samples = 1000  # sample fractional parts
solutions = set()

# Since the function depends on fractional parts, we focus on x in [0,2020]
# For practical purposes, consider fractional parts and integer parts separately.
for i in range(0, 2021):  # integer parts from 0 to 2020
    for j in range(samples):
        frac = j / samples
        x = i + frac
        y = x
        # iterate function 3 times
        for _ in range(max_iter):
            y = f(y)
        # check if value close to 17 (within a small tolerance)
        if abs(y - 17) < 1e-8:
            solutions.add(round(x, 8))

# The solutions set contains approximate solutions for x in [0,2020]
# Count of solutions
N = len(solutions)

# Output each solution
for sol in sorted(solutions):
    print(f'x â‰ˆ {sol}')

# When necessary, output N mod 1000
print(f'N mod 1000 = {N % 1000}')
```

This code:
- Enumerates fractional parts in [0,1),
- Checks iterates of \(f\),
- Records solutions close to 17,
- Prints all the approximate solutions,
- Reports the approximate count modulo 1000.

Because the exact solutions might be complex (e.g., multiple preimages), this approximation helps in conjecturing the true count and understanding the behavior of \(f^{(3)}(x)=17\).
