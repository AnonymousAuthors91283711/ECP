theorem P2016AIMEI_5 :
  ∃ (n t k : ℕ),
    0 < n ∧ 0 < t ∧
    n + k = 374 ∧
    (2 * t + k) * (k + 1) / 2 = 319 ∧
    n + t = P2016AIMEI_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: k=1, t=159, n=373, n + t=532
k=10, t=24, n=364, n + t=388
k=21, t=4, n=353, n + t=357. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the answer is n + t, based on respective relationships between k, t, and n. From the enumerations, the sums are 532, 388, and 357 — with 532 being the largest, corresponding to the first set satisfying the constraints. Since all options include positive n and t, and n + t is defined explicitly, the maximum sum (n + t) fitting the pattern is 532.
