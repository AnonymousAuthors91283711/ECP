theorem omnimath518 :
  ∀ a b c : ℝ, a ≠ 0 ∧ b ≠ 0 ∧ c ≠ 0 ∧ a + b + c = 0 ∧ a ^ 3 + b ^ 3 + c ^ 3 = a ^ 5 + b ^ 5 + c ^ 5 → a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 + c ^ 2 = omnimath518_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 6 / 5
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us five conditions:
   - a, b, c are non-zero real numbers
   - a + b + c = 0
   - a³ + b³ + c³ = a⁵ + b⁵ + c⁵
   And asks us to find the value of a² + b² + c²

2. Key mathematical facts:
   - When a + b + c = 0, we know:
     a³ + b³ + c³ = 3abc
     a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + bc + ca) = -2(ab + bc + ca)
   - The fifth power sum can be expressed in terms of lower powers

3. Through algebraic manipulation (using the given conditions and symmetric polynomial identities), we can derive that a² + b² + c² = 6/5

4. The proposed answer is 2, which doesn't match the correct value of 6/5 derived from the conditions.
