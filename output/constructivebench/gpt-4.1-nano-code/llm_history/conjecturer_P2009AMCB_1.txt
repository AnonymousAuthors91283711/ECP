theorem P2009AMCB_1 : 
  {b : ℕ | b ≤ 5 ∧ ∃ m : ℕ, 50 * (5 - b) + 75 * b = 100 * m} = {P2009AMCB_1_answer} := by sorry. Enumerated answers: b = 2, m = 3
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The provided enumeration suggests b = 2 matches the equation 50(5 - b) + 75b = 100m, which simplifies to 250 - 50b + 75b = 100m, hence 250 + 25b = 100m. To have 25b divisible by 100, b must satisfy that b = 2 (since 25*2=50), and m=3 satisfies the equation. The pattern points to b=2 as the unique value in the set satisfying the condition.
