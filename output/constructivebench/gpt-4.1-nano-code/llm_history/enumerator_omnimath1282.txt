To explore the problem, we need to analyze the set of integers `n` between 1 and 1000 where `(Nat.centralBinom n / 2)` is even. The key is observing the behavior of the central binomial coefficient and its divisibility properties.

For small `n`, central binomials tend to grow quite large, and their divisibility by 2 depends on specific properties â€” often related to the binary representation of `n`. The problem reduces to counting how many `n` in `[1, 1000]` satisfy that `Nat.centralBinom n / 2` is even, i.e., `(Nat.centralBinom n)` is divisible by 4.

We can test small values to identify the pattern for `n` such that `Nat.centralBinom n` is divisible by 4, then count within the range.

```python
# Enumerate n from 1 to 1000
# Check for the divisibility property: centralBinom(n) divisible by 4
# Since exact values are large, approximate by using properties:
# The central binomial coefficient is divisible by 4 iff n is divisible by 4 (except small cases)
# For more accurate results, directly compute, focusing on powers of 2 dividing the binomial coefficient

from math import comb, floor

count = 0
for n in range(1, 1001):
    c = comb(n, n // 2)  # central binomial coefficient
    # Check if c/2 is even => c divisible by 4
    if c % 4 == 0:
        print(n)
        count +=1

print("Total count:", count)
```
