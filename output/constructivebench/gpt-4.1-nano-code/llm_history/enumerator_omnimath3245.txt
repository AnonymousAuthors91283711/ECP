This problem appears to involve a sequence defined by a recurrence relation, and we are asked to compute an infinite product involving the terms \( a_k \). The sequence is given by \( a_0 = 5/2 \) and for \( k \geq 1 \), \( a_k = (a_{k-1})^2 - 2 \).

The infinite product: 
\[
\prod_{k=0}^\infty \left(1 - \frac{1}{a_k}\right)
\]

Given the recurrence, it's fruitful to analyze the sequence to find a pattern or closed form for \( a_k \), then evaluate or approximate the infinite product.

We will implement code to:
- Generate initial terms of \( a_k \).
- Compute the partial product \(\prod_{j=0}^k (1 - 1/a_j)\).
- Observe the behavior for increasing \( k \).
- Print the partial results immediately to aid in conjecture.

Here's a small sample code to perform this:

```python
# Sequence parameters
a_0 = 5/2

# Function to compute a_k recursively
def compute_a(k, cache):
    if k == 0:
        return a_0
    if k in cache:
        return cache[k]
    prev = compute_a(k - 1, cache)
    current = prev**2 - 2
    cache[k] = current
    return current

# Initialize cache for sequence
cache = {}

# Initialize product
product = 1.0

# Limit for partial computations
K_LIMIT = 20

for k in range(K_LIMIT):
    a_k = compute_a(k, cache)
    term = 1 - 1/a_k
    product *= term
    print(f"k={k}, a_k={a_k}, partial product={product}")
```

This code computes terms of the sequence and the partial product, printing each step immediately. It helps to conjecture the limit of the infinite product, observing its pattern as \( k \) progresses.

```python
# Sequence parameters
a_0 = 5/2

# Function to compute a_k recursively
def compute_a(k, cache):
    if k == 0:
        return a_0
    if k in cache:
        return cache[k]
    prev = compute_a(k - 1, cache)
    current = prev**2 - 2
    cache[k] = current
    return current

cache = {}
product = 1.0
K_LIMIT = 20

for k in range(K_LIMIT):
    a_k = compute_a(k, cache)
    term = 1 - 1/a_k
    product *= term
    print(f"k={k}, a_k={a_k}, partial product={product}")
```
