This problem is the sum of the first four cubes: 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3. The goal is to compute this sum through enumeration and print the answer directly, without hardcoding the value.

Here's a Python program that enumerates all possible sums of these cubes step-by-step, printing intermediate results, and then outputs the total sum when computed.

```python
# Enumerate the sum of cubes from 1 to 4
# Print each cube value, then the total sum at the end

def main():
    cubes = [i**3 for i in range(1, 5)]
    for i, c in enumerate(cubes, start=1):
        print(f"Cube of {i}: {c}")
    total_sum = sum(cubes)
    print(f"Sum of first 4 cubes: {total_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
