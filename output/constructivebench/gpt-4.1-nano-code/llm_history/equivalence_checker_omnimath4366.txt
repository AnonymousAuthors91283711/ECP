Ground Truth Answer: { (x, y, z) | x = y ∧ y = z }
Proposed Answer: {(n, n, n) | n > 0}
<<<True>>>
The ground truth answer states that the equation holds if and only if x, y, and z are equal (x = y = z). The proposed answer expresses the same condition but in a different notation: it specifies all triples where all three elements are equal to some positive natural number n. Both answers are equivalent since they both describe the same set of solutions where x = y = z with positive natural numbers. The notation difference is purely syntactic.
