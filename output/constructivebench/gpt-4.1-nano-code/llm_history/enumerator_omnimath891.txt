The problem describes a sequence \(a: \text{Fin }10 \to \mathbb{Z}\) with the recurrence relation \(a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_{n}\) for \(n \leq 6\), positive for all \(n \leq 9\), and with the condition \(a_9 = 2002\). We need to find the total number of such sequences.

Since the recurrence starts from \(a_0, a_1\), and the sequence is positive, we can brute-force possible initial pairs \((a_0, a_1)\), then generate the sequence and count those satisfying the conditions. To keep it efficient, limit initial guesses to small ranges. The main task is to enumerate pairs \((a_0, a_1)\) with positive integers and check if the sequence reaches \(a_9=2002\) with all positive terms.

```python
# Brute-force search for initial values a0, a1
# that generate sequences matching the constraints
# a(n+2) = a(n+1) + a(n),
# a_9 = 2002,
# and all a_n > 0

def generate_sequence(a0, a1):
    seq = [a0, a1]
    for n in range(2, 10):
        a_next = seq[-1] + seq[-2]
        # Early stop if non-positive
        if a_next <= 0:
            return None
        seq.append(a_next)
    return seq

counter = 0
# Limit the initial guesses for a0, a1 for efficiency
# because the sequence grows rapidly, starting from small positive values
for a0 in range(1, 21):
    for a1 in range(1, 21):
        seq = generate_sequence(a0, a1)
        if seq is not None and seq[9] == 2002:
            # Count each valid sequence
            print(seq)
            counter += 1

print("Total sequences:", counter)
```
