  omnimath4075_answer n p := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=4, p=2, partition=[{0, 1, 2}, {3}]. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ → Prop
The pattern suggests that the answer relates to evenly dividing the range [0, n-1] into p parts with equal sum. Since n=4, p=2 yields two partitions with sums 3 each, and the partition is {0,1,2} and {3}. For the general case, the partition involves dividing the range into p nearly equal segments with sums proportional to the index, specifically involving the binomial coefficients or the sum partitions. The simplest closed form aligns with the sum of integers up to n-1 divided by p, scaled appropriately for each subset. The key observation is the sum of an initial segment: n*(n-1)/2.

Final answer, in Lean:
<<<fun n p => ∃ (x : ℕ), x * p = n * (n - 1) / 2>>>
# Explanation
It captures that each subset’s sum should equal the total sum divided by p, consistent with the problem's partitioning condition.
