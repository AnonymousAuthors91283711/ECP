theorem P2023AMCA_20 : 
  (List.sum (build_row 2023) % 10 = P2023AMCA_20_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 2. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern of build_row resembles Pascal's triangle shifted, with each interior element being a sum of neighboring entries plus 1. For large n, the sum appears to grow roughly like 2^{n+1} minus a small adjustment. Based on the enumeration (answer 2), the limit tends toward 2 mod 10 as n grows large, and the sum's pattern suggests the answer stabilizes at 2.
