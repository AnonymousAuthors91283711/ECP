The problem involves analyzing pairs of competitors and determining the proportion that fulfills a certain "favorable" condition based on their scores. Because the set of competitors can vary and scores are functions, we'll simulate small scenarios with fixed parameters. We'll enumerate all possible score combinations for a small number of competitors (e.g., 3), compute pairs, determine favorable pairs, and calculate the ratio `p`. By doing so, we gather and print possible answers immediately as we find them, aiming to understand the structure and potential bounds of the ratio.

```python
# Enumerate possible small score assignments for 3 competitors
# For simplicity, assume scores are from 0 to 3 to keep computations manageable
competitors = [1, 2, 3]
score_range = range(4)  # Scores 0..3

answers = set()

# Generate all possible score functions
for g_scores in [(a, b, c) for a in score_range for b in score_range for c in score_range]:
    for t_scores in [(a, b, c) for a in score_range for b in score_range for c in score_range]:
        # Map scores
        g_map = dict(zip(competitors, g_scores))
        t_map = dict(zip(competitors, t_scores))
        
        pairs = [(a, b) for a in competitors for b in competitors if a != b]
        total_pairs = len(pairs)
        favorable_count = 0
        
        for (a, b) in pairs:
            # Check the favorable condition
            g_a, g_b = g_map[a], g_map[b]
            t_a, t_b = t_map[a], t_map[b]
            if ((g_a > g_b and t_b > t_a) or (g_b > g_a and t_a > t_b)):
                favorable_count += 1
        
        p = favorable_count / total_pairs
        answer_value = int(10000 * p)
        # Track the answer
        answers.add(answer_value)
        print(answer_value)
```
