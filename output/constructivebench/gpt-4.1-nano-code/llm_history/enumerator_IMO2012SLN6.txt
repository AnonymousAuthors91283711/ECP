The problem appears to involve a divisibility property concerning powers and expressions of the form \(2^n y + 1\) dividing \(x^{2n} - 1\). Since the parameters are quite general, one way to approach it is to find particular \(x\) values satisfying the divisibility for all \(y, n > 0\). Because the question is high-level and generic, sample small values of \(x\) and check the divisibility condition for various small \(n, y\).

We will:
- Select small \(x\), e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- For each \(x\), test for a few increasing \(n\), e.g., 1 to 10, and several \(y \ge 1\).
- Identify which \(x\) satisfy the condition for the tested range, streaming solutions accordingly.
- Since the goal is to find the specific \(x\) such that the condition holds for all \(y, n\), if any \(x\) passes all small tests, it provides a candidate.

Given the nature, the value of \(x=1\) trivially satisfies the condition for all \(y, n\) because \(x^{2n} - 1=0\), hence divisible by everything. For others, check whether the divisibility holds often or is impossible.

```python
# Enumerate candidate values of x to identify the one satisfying the property
# for small y, n. Focus on small x to find potential solutions.

max_x = 10
max_n = 10
candidate_xs = []

for x in range(1, max_x + 1):
    satisfies_all = True
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        for y in range(1, 5):  # test first few y
            numerator = x**(2 * n) - 1
            divisor = 2**n * y + 1
            if numerator % divisor != 0:
                satisfies_all = False
                break
        if not satisfies_all:
            break
    if satisfies_all:
        print(f"x = {x} satisfies the divisibility condition for n=1..{max_n} and y=1..4")
        candidate_xs.append(x)
# Output candidates found
print("Potential solutions x:", candidate_xs)
```
