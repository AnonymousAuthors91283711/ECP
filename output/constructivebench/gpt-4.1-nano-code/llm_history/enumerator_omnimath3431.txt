The problem appears to involve algebraic identities and integer solutions. The goal is to find all integers \( m \) such that there exists an integer \( n \) satisfying the identity:

\[
(x + m)(x + n) = x^2 + (m + n)x + mn
\]

which is a standard expansion, and also that:

\[
mn = -12
\]

and then to verify that some particular \( m \) does **not** belong to this set.

To assist with conjecturing, I will:

- Enumerate all divisors \( n \) of \(-12\),
- For each \( n \), associate \( m \) as the corresponding divisor,
- Check the identity properties,
- Print each \( m \) to see all candidates.

Since the problem involves finding \( m \) such that \( m \times n = -12 \), and \( n \) is an integer divisor of \(-12\), we only need to consider \(\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 4, \pm 6, \pm 12\).

Let's write the code.

```python
# Enumerate all divisors n of -12
divisors = []
for divisor in [-1, 1, -2, 2, -3, 3, -4, 4, -6, 6, -12, 12]:
    m = -12 // divisor
    # For each divisor, check if m*n == -12
    if m * divisor == -12:
        print(f"Candidate m: {m} (with n = {divisor}), since {m} * {divisor} = -12")
```

This code will print all integers \( m \) such that there exists a \( n \) with \( mn = -12 \). We may then analyze these candidates for further verification or testing.
