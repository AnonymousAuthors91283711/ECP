The problem seems to involve finding a specific natural number answer such that the product \(2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5 \times 6\) equals \(5 \times 6 \times x \times x\). To solve this, we can programmatically verify possible values for \(x\) and find the one that satisfies the equation, focusing on exact values.

By simplifying the original equation:
\[ 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5 \times 6 = 5 \times 6 \times x^2 \]
we can directly compute the left side, then for various \(x\) values, check when the equation holds.

```python
# Goal: find x such that 2*2*3*3*5*6 = 5*6*x^2
# Simplify left side:
left = 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 6
# right side: 5 * 6 * x^2
# so x^2 = left / (5 * 6)

# Precompute constant denominator
denominator = 5 * 6

# Enumerate candidate x values (positive integers)
for x in range(1, 100):  # limit search for efficiency
    if denominator * (x ** 2) == left:
        print(f"x = {x}")
```
