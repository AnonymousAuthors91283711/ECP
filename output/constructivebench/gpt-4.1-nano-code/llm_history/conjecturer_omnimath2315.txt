. Enumerated Answers: 63. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The key insight is counting the number of nonempty subsets of the set of all pairs (Fin 3 × Fin 2). This set has 3 * 2 = 6 elements. The total number of subsets of a 6-element set is 2^6 = 64. Excluding the empty set leaves 63, which matches the enumerated answer.

The errors in your initial proposed answer are because you included a full English explanation directly in the Lean abbreviation, which is invalid syntax. In Lean, the abbreviation should be a simple expression of type ℕ, not a comment or description.

Thus, the correct formal answer is simply: 2^6 - 1

Final answer in Lean:

<<<2^6 - 1>>>
