The problem appears to involve finding the largest 10-digit number divisible by 8 such that all its digits are distinct. Once found, the solution involves verifying the number and perhaps extracting its last three digits for the answer.

Since the goal is to use a Python program for enumeration:
- It searches through 10-digit numbers divisible by 8.
- Checks if all digits are distinct.
- Tracks the maximum such number encountered.
- Records the last three digits of that number as the final answer.

This approach is efficient enough given the constraints, as it leverages divisibility and digit uniqueness conditions directly and avoids brute forcing the entire space.

```python
# Enumerate 10-digit numbers divisible by 8 with all distinct digits, find the maximum
max_num = -1
max_num_last_three = 0

# Iterate from the largest 10-digit number downward to find greatest satisfying conditions
# Since the largest 10-digit number is 9,999,999,999, start from there and go down
for n in range(999999999, 10**9 - 1, -8):  # decrement by 8 to ensure divisibility by 8
    s = str(n)
    if len(set(s)) == 10:  # all digits are unique
        max_num = n
        max_num_last_three = n % 1000
        print(f"Found candidate: {n}")
print(f"Maximum number: {max_num}")
print(f"Last three digits: {max_num_last_three}")
```
