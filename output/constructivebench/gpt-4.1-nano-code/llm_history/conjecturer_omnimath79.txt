  omnimath79_answer ≤ n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 3
Count of triplets with ≤ 2018 sum < 1: 0
Count of triplets with ≤ 2018 sum > 2: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<0>>>

Given all a, b, c in [0,1], the sums are within [0,3]. Since counts are 0 for sums < 1 and > 2, at n=3, the counts are zero, implying the minimal n satisfying the condition is 0.
