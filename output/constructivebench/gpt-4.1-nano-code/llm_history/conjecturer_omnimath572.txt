. Enumerated answers: Approximate limit: 1.337255187474082. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The sequence resembles a linear growth pattern plus a diminishing correction term. Based on the recurrence and the approximation, the dominant part converges to around 4/3. The correction term tends to zero as n→∞. Hence, the limit is 4/3.
