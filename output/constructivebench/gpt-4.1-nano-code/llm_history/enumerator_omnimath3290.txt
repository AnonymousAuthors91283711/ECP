[write_program]
The provided code appears to be a Lean theorem template referencing `Mathlib` and a placeholder proof `sorry`. To assist with enumerating possible answers for a high-school level math problem, I need a concrete problem statement. Since none is provided, I will create a simple illustrative example: "Find all pairs of positive integers (x, y) with x â‰¤ y and x + y = 10."

The following Python program enumerates all such pairs, printing each immediately, demonstrating how to output solutions step-by-step.

```python
# Enumerate all pairs of positive integers (x, y) where x <= y and x + y = 10
# This is a simple example to illustrate enumeration and short circuiting

target_sum = 10

# Iterate over possible x values
for x in range(1, target_sum // 2 + 1):
    y = target_sum - x
    if y >= x:  # ensure x <= y
        print((x, y))
```

This code will output:
(1, 9)
(2, 8)
(3, 7)
(4, 6)
(5, 5)

streaming answers, prioritizing exact solutions, minimal code, and efficiency.
