Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {x | x = 70 ∨ x = 110}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer {x | x = 70 ∨ x = 110} is mostly correct as it captures two valid solutions to the trigonometric equation within the given domain (0 < x < 360). However, the ground truth answer might include additional constraints or verification of the solutions, which we cannot see due to the 'sorry' placeholder. The proposed solutions x=70 and x=110 do satisfy the equation when checked numerically, but without seeing the complete ground truth, we can't guarantee full equivalence.
