[write_program]
This problem presents a recursive function `f` with specific base cases, defined as:
- f(0) = 2001
- f(1) = 2002
- f(2) = 2003
and for k ≥ 0:
- f(k+3) = f(k+1) + f(k) - f(k+2)

The goal is to find f(n - 1) for n ≥ 3, observing the pattern or potential formula by enumerating small values.

Given the recursive relation, notice it resembles a linear recurrence, which can be difficult generally, but since n is small, we can explicitly compute values for small n to conjecture a pattern.

We'll write a Python program to compute f(n - 1) for small n (say n=3 to 10). To make calculations efficient, we will implement the recurrence directly.

```python
# Enumerate values of the sequence f for small n to identify patterns.
def compute_f(n_max):
    # Base cases
    f = [2001, 2002, 2003]
    for k in range(3, n_max):
        # Apply recurrence: f(k) = f(k - 2) + f(k - 3) - f(k - 1)
        val = f[k - 2] + f[k - 3] - f[k - 1]
        print(f'f({k}) = {val}')
        f.append(val)
    return f

# Compute for n from 3 to 10, i.e., f(2) to f(9)
f_sequence = compute_f(10)

# Output relevant values f(n-1) for n=3..10
for n in range(3, 11):
    print(f'For n={n}, f(n-1) = {f_sequence[n - 1]}')
```
