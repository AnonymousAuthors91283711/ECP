This problem appears to be a variant of a combinatorial puzzle involving injections from a finite set into a grid (dwarves × hats), with certain distinguishability criteria among these injections. To find the greatest possible k, the key is to consider the largest possible family of functions satisfying the injectivity and difference properties, which resembles an extremal set problem potentially akin to the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem or related combinatorial bounds.

Given the constraints:
- total dwarves: 66
- total hats: 111
- each function maps from a finite set of size k into the product space.

The goal: find the maximum size of such a family, i.e., the greatest k satisfying the constraints.

We can approach this by testing decreasing values of k starting from the minimum of dwarves and hats, i.e., 66 (because injective maps from a set of size k into the larger set). We then verify whether such a family exists, and print the candidates.

The code below attempts k from 66 down to 1, checking for the maximum k that could admit such a set of functions, based on simple combinatorial bounds.

```python
# Enumerate possible values of k from the largest possible down to 1
# based on injectivity and distinguishability constraints.
# Since each f_i is injective and the images of different functions must differ
# in at least one coordinate, the maximum number of such functions relates
# to the size of the target space (dwarves × hats).

dwarves = 66
hats = 111
max_k = 0

for k in range(min(dwarves, hats), 0, -1):
    # For each k, check if it's possible to have such a family:
    # The maximum number of injective functions f_i from a set of size k
    # to a set of size dwarves * hats is limited.
    # The total number of injective functions from k to N is permutation of N over k.
    max_functions = 1
    for i in range(k):
        max_functions *= (dwarves * hats - i)
    # The total number of functions must be at least k to satisfy the difference condition
    # We only need a lower bound for k; thus, when max_functions >= k, it might be possible.
    # But more formality is needed. For simplicity, check if permutations suffice.
    if max_functions >= k:
        print(f"Candidate k={k} with max permutations: {max_functions}")
        max_k = k
        break

print(f"Maximum k satisfying the constraints: {max_k}")
```
