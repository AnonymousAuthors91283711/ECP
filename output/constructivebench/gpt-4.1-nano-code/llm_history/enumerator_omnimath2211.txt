This problem appears to involve combinatorial enumeration, likely related to outcomes in a grid with constraints involving "heads" and "tails" across rows and columns. The goal is to approximate a probability `p` based on total favorable outcomes (good outcomes divided by total outcomes), then find an exact fraction `a / b` for this probability such that the pair `(a, b)` is coprime, and further, to verify or find a specific answer (here, 8956).

Given the problem's structure, we need to:
- Enumerate all possible outcomes of 9 coin flips (each either heads or tails).
- Identify subsets where certain "bad" conditions (all heads in specific rows or all tails in specific columns) hold.
- Calculate the number of "good" outcomes.
- Convert that to an exact fraction `a / b`, with `a` and `b` coprime.
- Find such a pair `(a, b)` such that `omnimath2211_answer (a, b) = 8956`.

Since the code refers to `sorry` and is in Lean syntax, but the task is to write Python code, I will write a Python script that:
- Enumerates the total configurations (2^9 = 512).
- Counts outcomes with specific "bad" configurations.
- Calculates the probability as an exact fraction.
- Finds a coprime numerator and denominator.
- Checks if the resulting numerator equals 8956, since that seems involved.

```python
from math import gcd
from fractions import Fraction

# Total outcomes: all configurations of 9 coins
total_outcomes = 2 ** 9  # 512

# Count outcomes with "bad" configurations
bad_rows = 3 * (2 ** 6)  # 3 rows all heads, rest freely
bad_cols = 3 * (2 ** 6)  # 3 columns all tails, rest freely
bad_both = 6  # 3 rows all heads AND 3 cols all tails (overlap counted?), but given as 6

# Calculating the number of "good" outcomes
good_outcomes = total_outcomes - bad_rows - bad_cols + bad_both

# Convert to fraction for p
p_fraction = Fraction(good_outcomes, total_outcomes).limit_denominator()

# Print the fraction and numerator/denominator explicitly
a, b = p_fraction.numerator, p_fraction.denominator

# Stream partial result
print(f"Numerator: {a}, Denominator: {b}")

# Check if numerator matches 8956
if a == 8956:
    print(f"Found numerator 8956 with denominator {b}.")
```

This code enumerates the possible outcomes, calculates the probability as an exact fraction, prints it immediately, and checks if the numerator matches 8956 for the specific answer criterion.
