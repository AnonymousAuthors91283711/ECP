[write_program]
This problem appears to be about finding natural numbers \( n \) such that \( n^2 \) has all odd digits in its decimal representation. The goal is to find such \( n \), potentially the smallest or all such \( n \).

To assist in conjecturing, we'll write a Python program that:
- Tests integers \( n \) starting from 1.
- Checks whether all digits of \( n^2 \) are odd.
- Prints each qualifying \( n \) immediately, as well as the corresponding \( n^2 \).
- Stops either after a certain number of results or upon reaching a threshold to avoid infinite loops.

Given the context, the problem hints toward small values, so we'll test the first several numbers.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers n starting from 1 upward
max_candidates = 100  # adjust as needed for scope
for n in range(1, max_candidates + 1):
    n_square_str = str(n * n)
    # Check if all digits in n^2 are odd
    if all(int(d) % 2 == 1 for d in n_square_str):
        print(f"n = {n}, n^2 = {n*n} with digits {n_square_str}")
```

This script will output all \( n \leq 100 \) such that all digits of \( n^2 \) are odd, aiding in forming conjectures about the nature and possible solutions.
