theorem P2019AIMEII_2 :
  let (p, q) := P2019AIMEII_2_answer
  probVisits7 7 = p / q ∧ p.Coprime q := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (21, 32). Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
These values follow the Fibonacci sequence pattern, with probVisits7(n) roughly matching F(n+1)/2^{n-1}. For n=7, the simplified ratio is (21, 32), consistent with Fibonacci expansion. Final answer: <<< (21, 32) >>>
