[write_program]
This problem involves evaluating an expression involving variables `x` and `y`, with given equalities `x = 3` and `y = 4`. The goal is to compute `x * y - x`.

Since the problem is straightforward, but we're asked to write a program that enumerates possible answers (e.g., exact values) efficiently, we'll generate the candidate answers based on the provided assignments, then compute the expression accordingly.

In this case, just substituting the values and computing `x * y - x` should give the answer. We'll create a small enumeration of parameter values, but since the variables are fixed by assumptions, the answer is fixed: `3 * 4 - 3 = 12 - 3 = 9`. 

To comply with the instructions, the program will "enumerate" this answer and print it immediately.

```python
# Enumerate the specific answer based on known substitution
x = 3
y = 4
answer = x * y - x
print(answer)
```
