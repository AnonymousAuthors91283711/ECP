The problem appears to analyze a sequence of quadratic polynomials \(f(n)\), with coefficients depending on \(n\). The goal is to find all \(n > 0\) such that \(f(n)\) has no real roots. In other words, for each \(f(n)\), analyze its discriminant: if the discriminant \(D(n) < 0\), then \(f(n)\) has no real roots.

Given \(f(n) = x^2 + (2n - 1) x + (n^2 - 22)\), the discriminant is:
\[ D(n) = (2n - 1)^2 - 4(n^2 - 22) = (4n^2 - 4n + 1) - 4n^2 + 88 = -4n + 89 \]

We are interested in when \(D(n) < 0\):
\[
-4n + 89 < 0 \implies 4n > 89 \implies n > \frac{89}{4} = 22.25
\]

Since \(n\) is a natural number, this means \(n \ge 23\).

Verify for \(n = 23\):
\[
D(23) = -4(23) + 89 = -92 + 89 = -3 < 0
\]
and for \(n=22\):
\[
D(22) = -4(22) + 89 = -88 + 89 = 1 > 0
\]
which suggests that for \(n \ge 23\), the polynomial has no real roots, matching the condition.

The minimal \(n\) with no real roots is \(n=23\), and for larger \(n\), the discriminant remains negative.

The program will enumerate \(n\) and check \(D(n)\).

```python
# Enumerate n and check for discriminant < 0
def discriminant(n):
    return -4 * n + 89

# Find the smallest n > 0 with no real roots
# i.e., discriminant < 0
for n in range(1, 50):  # 50 chosen arbitrarily above 23
    D = discriminant(n)
    if D < 0:
        print(n)
```

This code will list all \(n \ge 23\) up to a reasonable upper bound, providing potential answers to the problem.
