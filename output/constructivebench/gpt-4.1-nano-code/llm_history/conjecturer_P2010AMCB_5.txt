. Enumerated Answers: 3. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The expression to evaluate is: 1 - (2 - (3 - (4 + e))). To simplify:
- Start with innermost: 3 - (4 + e) = 3 - 4 - e = -1 - e
- Next: 2 - (3 - (4 + e)) = 2 - (-1 - e) = 2 + 1 + e = 3 + e
- Finally: 1 - (2 - (3 - (4 + e))) = 1 - (3 + e) = -2 - e

Thus, the expression simplifies to -2 - e. We need to find e such that this equals 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 + e, which simplifies to -8 + e. Setting these equal:
-2 - e = -8 + e
→ -2 + 8 = e + e
→ 6 = 2e
→ e = 3

Therefore, the answer is 3, a constant integer.

The correct Lean declaration should directly assign 3 to `P2010AMCB_5_answer`.
