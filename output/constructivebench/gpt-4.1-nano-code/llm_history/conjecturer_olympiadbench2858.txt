. Enumerated answers: (1, 2)
(4, 3)
(7, 2)
(8, 1)
Total solutions: 4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests solutions are pairs with x and y positive integers that satisfy x^2 - 8x + y^2 + 4y = 5, which can be rearranged as (x - 4)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 25 with x > 0, y > 0. The solutions are limited points around the circle of radius 5 centered at (4, -2). The positive integer solutions enumerated are (1, 2), (4, 3), (7, 2), (8, 1). Their count is 4.

Hence, the total solutions are 4.
