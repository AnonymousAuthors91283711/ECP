5. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The set S consists of functions t where each t i is prime, and t satisfies a quadratic equation. The question asks for the primes p such that for at least 7 of these functions t, t i = p. Since p must be prime and associated with many such functions, it is natural to consider small primes, especially p = 2 and p = 5 which appear in chebyshev-like distributions and common quadratic roots.

Based on the enumeration and classic quadratic analysis involving small primes, the primes that satisfy these conditions appear to be 2 and 5.

Final answer in Lean set notation:
<<< {2, 5} >>>
