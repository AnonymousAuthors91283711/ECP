This problem defines a set involving injective functions from Fin m to a 4-tupleed structure over Fin n, with a property related to no set of size n being injectively mapped under a certain projection. Our goal is to find the maximal such m for a fixed n, given n > 0, and provide an algorithmic enumeration to assist in conjecture.

Approach:
- For small n (e.g., n=1,2,3), enumerate candidate m from 1 up to a reasonable threshold (say 10).
- For each m, generate all injective functions from Fin m to the set of all 4-tuples over Fin n.
- For each injective function, check if the property holds: no subset of c of size n maps injectively into some coordinate tuple (which would violate the set-injectivity condition).
- When the maximum m is found, output it; for others, output the found values to help conjecture.

This implementation is a simplified model, capturing the core enumeration idea.
