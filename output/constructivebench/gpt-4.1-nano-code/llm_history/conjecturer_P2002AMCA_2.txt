    (x - 3) / 9 = P2002AMCA_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No solutions found within enumeration.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the equation (x - 9) / 3 = 43, solve for x: x = 43 * 3 + 9 = 138 + 9 = 147. Then (x - 3) / 9 = (147 - 3) / 9 = 144 / 9 = 16. Since there's no other solution, the answer is 16.
