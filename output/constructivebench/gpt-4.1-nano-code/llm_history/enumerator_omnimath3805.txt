This problem appears to involve functional equations with real-valued functions. The core functional equation is:

```
f(f(x) * f(y)) + f(x + y) = f(x * y)
```

Our task is to find or approximate all functions `f : ℝ → ℝ` satisfying this for all real `x, y`. Since an exact formal proof may be complex, our goal is to enumerate solutions that fit the given functional equation, possibly by testing simple candidate functions such as constant, linear, or polynomial functions.

We'll prioritize candidates that are simple, like constant functions or linear functions, then check for the functional equation's satisfaction. Because `f` could be complex, we'll limit our search over a small, representative set of functions evaluated at particular points, printing each candidate if it satisfies the equation at sampled points.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions f: ℝ -> ℝ from simple forms
# Test candidates at some sample points to check if they satisfy the functional equation

def test_constant(c):
    # Test if constant function f(x) = c satisfies the equation
    # For all x, y: c + c = c => 2c = c => c=0
    return c == 0

def test_linear(a, b):
    # Test linear functions f(x) = a*x + b
    # Check at sample points: x, y in {-1, 0, 1} to see if the equation holds
    test_points = [-1, 0, 1]
    for x in test_points:
        for y in test_points:
            # Compute left side: f(f(x)*f(y)) + f(x + y)
            fx = a*x + b
            fy = a*y + b
            f_fx_fy = a*(fx*fy) + b
            f_x_plus_y = a*(x + y) + b
            # Compute right side: f(x*y)
            f_xy = a*(x*y) + b
            if abs(f_fx_fy + f_x_plus_y - f_xy) > 1e-6:
                return False
    return True

# Collect solutions
solutions = []

# Constant solution candidate: c=0
if test_constant(0):
    solutions.append(lambda x: 0)
    print("Constant zero function: f(x) = 0")

# Linear candidate: f(x) = a*x + b
# We test a and b in some small range
for a in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    for b in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
        if test_linear(a, b):
            # Define the function
            def f(x, a=a, b=b):
                return a*x + b
            solutions.append(f)
            print(f"Linear function: f(x) = {a}*x + {b}")
