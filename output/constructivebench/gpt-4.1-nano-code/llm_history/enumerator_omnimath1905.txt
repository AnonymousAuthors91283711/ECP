[write_program]
This code appears to involve a process where applying certain rules ('A' → ['A','B'], 'B' → ['B','A']) iteratively to an initial list (starting with ['A']) is performed 10 times. After these iterations, it counts the number of consecutive equal pairs in the resulting list, but the answer is unknown (indicated by 'sorry'). 

For enumeration, the main task is to simulate the iterations, generate the final list after 10 iterations starting from ['A'], compute the count of equal adjacent pairs, and print each intermediate step if desired (though the problem requests only final answers streamed when found). Since the iteration is deterministic given small steps, we can just perform it explicitly and compute.

The enumeration doesn't involve multiple parameter searches or file inputs; it simply produces the final count. The process is efficient for small steps, so code runs quickly and outputs the found count directly.

Below is the complete program that performs the iteration, counts the pairs, and outputs the result, suitable for execution as `python enumerator.py`.

```python
# Enumerate the process of applying rules, then count equal pairs
def apply_rule(c):
    if c == 'A':
        return ['A', 'B']
    elif c == 'B':
        return ['B', 'A']
    else:
        return []

def iterate_rules(n, lst):
    for _ in range(n):
        new_list = []
        for c in lst:
            new_list.extend(apply_rule(c))
        lst = new_list
    return lst

def count_equal_pairs(lst):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(lst)-1):
        if lst[i] == lst[i+1]:
            count += 1
    return count

# Start with initial list
initial_list = ['A']
n_iterations = 10
final_list = iterate_rules(n_iterations, initial_list)
result = count_equal_pairs(final_list)
print(result)
```
