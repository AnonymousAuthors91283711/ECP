The problem appears to involve finding the greatest value of A, where A is defined in terms of angles θ₁ and θ₂, with the constraints involving their difference Δθ, and specific calculations with min, max, and π. Given the definitions, the key is to analyze how the minimal piece — involving Δθ and its related expressions — behaves as θ₁ and θ₂ vary.

Let's explore possible values of Δθ (the difference between θ₁ and θ₂), which ranges from 0 to 2π. Since the problem involves the minimum of Δθ and 2π - Δθ, the behavior is symmetric around Δθ = π. The minimal sector appears at the points where the difference is either small or near π.

We will examine Δθ at a few critical points:

- Δθ = 0 (θ₁ = θ₂): then piece1 = 0, piece2 = π, smallest_piece = 0
- Δθ = π/2: calculate corresponding smallest_piece
- Δθ = π: then piece1 = min(π, π) = π, piece2 = π - max(π, π) = 0, smallest_piece = 0
- Δθ close to 0 or π: smallest_piece tends to 0

The maximum of smallest_piece/(2π) occurs at points where smallest_piece is maximized. Because smallest_piece involves min of several quantities, the maximum occurs at points where these quantities balance — approximately when the pieces are equal or near their maximums.

We'll evaluate small Δθ values systematically to approximate the maximum A. To do this efficiently, define a set of sample Δθ values in (0, 2π), compute smallest_piece, and identify the maximum A.

```python
import math

# Parameters
pi = math.pi
max_A = -math.inf  # Initialize max A
best_delta_theta = None

# Sample Δθ values from 0 to 2π, focusing on critical points and midpoints
sampled_deltas = [0, pi/4, pi/2, 3*pi/4, pi, 5*pi/4, 3*pi/2, 7*pi/4, 2*pi]

for Δθ in sampled_deltas:
    piece1 = min(Δθ, 2*pi - Δθ)
    piece2 = pi - max(Δθ, 2*pi - Δθ)
    smallest_piece = min(piece1, piece2, 2*pi - piece1 - piece2)
    A = smallest_piece / (2 * pi)

    # Stream answers when they are better
    if A > max_A:
        max_A = A
        best_delta_theta = Δθ
    print(f"Δθ = {Δθ:.4f}, smallest_piece = {smallest_piece:.4f}, A = {A:.4f}")

# Output the maximum found value
print(f"Maximum A ≈ {max_A:.4f} at Δθ = {best_delta_theta:.4f}")
```
