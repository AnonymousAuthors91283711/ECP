The problem involves a functional equation with some constraints: \(f(0) \neq 0\) and \((f(x + y))^2 = 2f(x)f(y) + \max(f(x^2 + y^2), f(x^2) + f(y^2))\). To explore solutions, we will systematically test simple candidate functions at various points.

Since the problem's key challenge is to find functions satisfying this equation, we focus on constant functions \(f(x) = c\) first. If \(f\) is constant, then:

\((f(x + y))^2 = c^2\)

and

\(2f(x)f(y) = 2c^2\),

and the \(\max\) term becomes \(\max(c, c + c) = \max(c, 2c)\).

Plugging into the equation:

\[c^2 = 2c^2 + \max(c, 2c)\]

- For \(c \neq 0\), this becomes:

\[c^2 = 2c^2 + \max(c, 2c)\]

which simplifies to:

\[0 = c^2 + \max(c, 2c)\]

We can test small integer values \(c\).

To check functions, we'll generate candidate constants and functions defined on a small set to see if they satisfy the equation approximately, printing each candidate that does so exactly or close within a small epsilon.

```python
# Enumerate constant functions with values in a small set
candidates = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
epsilon = 1e-8

for c in candidates:
    # Since f is constant, test at representative points
    f0 = c
    def f(x): return c
    # Test the functional equation at specific points
    for x in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for y in [-1, 0, 1]:
            left = (f(x + y))**2
            right = 2 * f(x) * f(y)
            max_term = max(f(x**2 + y**2), f(x**2) + f(y**2))
            val = right + max_term
            if abs(left - val) < epsilon:
                print(f"Constant function f(x)={c} satisfies at x={x}, y={y}")
```
