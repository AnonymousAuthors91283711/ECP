abbrev P2004AMCB_1_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2004AMCB_1 : 
  ∃! x : ℕ, x * 2^4 = 48 ∧ P2004AMCB_1_answer = x := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x = 3. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem states x * 2^4 = 48; thus, x = 48 / 16 = 3. The answer is directly derived from the equation and is independent of the predicate P2004AMCB_1_answer.
