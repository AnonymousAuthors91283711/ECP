The problem involves complex numbers forming an equilateral triangle with side length 18, and their sum having magnitude 36. We want to compute the magnitude of the sum of pairwise products \( bc + ca + ab \).

Given the symmetric conditions, a natural approach is to consider specific configurations that satisfy the constraints, and analyze the possible values for the symmetric sum \( bc + ca + ab \). Since all points are at equal distances, they form an equilateral triangle, and the sum \( a + b + c \) has magnitude 36, which suggests points are positioned arranges with a certain symmetry.

To simplify, choose parameters that fit the constraints:
- Place \( a \) at the origin (0 + 0i),
- Then \( b \) at (18, 0),
- \( c \) at (9, 9âˆš3), forming an equilateral triangle with side length 18.

Calculate \( a + b + c \) and the sum \( bc + ca + ab \), then determine \( |bc + ca + ab| \). I will embed these calculations into the program with explicit values, confirming the key quantities.

```python
import math

# Coordinates of vertices forming an equilateral triangle
a_x, a_y = 0, 0
b_x, b_y = 18, 0
c_x, c_y = 9, 9 * math.sqrt(3)

# Convert to complex numbers
a = complex(a_x, a_y)
b = complex(b_x, b_y)
c = complex(c_x, c_y)

# Check side lengths (should be 18)
side_ab = abs(b - a)
side_bc = abs(c - b)
side_ca = abs(a - c)

# Sum of vertices
S = a + b + c
abs_S = abs(S)

# Sum of pairwise products
product_sum = b * c + c * a + a * b
abs_product_sum = abs(product_sum)

print(f"Vertices: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
print(f"Sides: |ab|={side_ab}, |bc|={side_bc}, |ca|={side_ca}")
print(f"|a + b + c|={abs_S}")
print(f"|bc + ca + ab|={abs_product_sum}")
```
