The problem appears to be about finding the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that the triangular number \( T_n = n(n+1)/2 \) multiplied by 9 equals some answer, which is to be determined. The goal is to enumerate possible values to identify the true answer without hardcoding it, and specifically to find the minimal \( n \) satisfying the condition.

Let's interpret the question:
We are looking for an integer \( n \geq 0 \) satisfying:

\[ 9 \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \text{some value} \]

and among those \( n \), the minimal one.

The program will:
- Iterate over small \( n \)
- Calculate the corresponding value
- Record and print only those values
- Keep track of the minimum \( n \) satisfying the condition

Below is the code fulfilling the requirements:

```python
# Enumerate n, compute 9 * n(n+1)/2, and find the minimal n with a value
# Limited to small n for efficiency and demonstration purposes

max_n = 100  # limit to 100 to keep output manageable
found_answers = []

for n in range(max_n + 1):
    value = 9 * n * (n + 1) // 2
    print(f"n={n}, answer={value}")
    # Record if answer is non-zero (or any other condition if desired)
    # Here, we record all answers for conjecture
    found_answers.append((n, value))

# Find minimal n with the given answer
# The smallest n with non-zero value, if any: since answer=0 when n=0
# For non-zero solutions, start from n=1
min_n = None
min_value = None
for n, val in found_answers:
    if val != 0:
        if min_value is None or n < min_n:
            min_n = n
            min_value = val

if min_n is not None:
    print(f"Smallest n with answer {min_value} is n={min_n}")
else:
    print("No positive n found with non-zero answer.")
```
