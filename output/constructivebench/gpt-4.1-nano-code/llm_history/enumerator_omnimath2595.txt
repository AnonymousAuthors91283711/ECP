This problem involves analyzing the measure of unions of square neighborhoods within the unit square, likely relating to a geometric probability or measure-approximation scenario. To assist in conjecturing the true answer, I'll implement a computational enumeration over sample points within the unit square, evaluate the measure of the union of neighborhoods of these points, and compute the integral approximation accordingly. We'll test a grid of points, compute neighborhood unions, measure their areas, and perform a discrete approximation of the integral.

Because of combinatorial complexity, we'll restrict to a small grid (e.g., 3x3) and approximate the integral as a sum. The code will output each evaluated union measure immediately for transparency.

```python
import itertools
import math

# Define parameters for sampling within the unit square
grid_size = 3  # 3x3 grid for sampling points
half_radius = 0.5  # neighborhood radius

# Generate sample points in the unit square
points = [(i / (grid_size - 1), j / (grid_size - 1)) for i in range(grid_size) for j in range(grid_size)]

# Function to compute union area of neighborhoods of two points
def union_area(p1, p2):
    def rect_centered_at(p):
        return (max(p[0]-half_radius, 0), max(p[1]-half_radius, 0),
                min(p[0]+half_radius, 1), min(p[1]+half_radius, 1))
    # Neighborhood rectangles
    r1 = rect_centered_at(p1)
    r2 = rect_centered_at(p2)
    # Compute union of rectangles area
    def rect_area(r):
        width = max(r[2] - r[0], 0)
        height = max(r[3] - r[1], 0)
        return width * height
    # Approximate union as sum minus intersection
    def rect_intersection(r_a, r_b):
        x_left = max(r_a[0], r_b[0])
        y_bottom = max(r_a[1], r_b[1])
        x_right = min(r_a[2], r_b[2])
        y_top = min(r_a[3], r_b[3])
        if x_right < x_left or y_top < y_bottom:
            return 0
        return (x_right - x_left) * (y_top - y_bottom)
    area1 = rect_area(r1)
    area2 = rect_area(r2)
    inter = rect_intersection(r1, r2)
    return area1 + area2 - inter

# Compute sum over pairs
total_union_area = 0
count = 0
for p1, p2 in itertools.product(points, repeat=2):
    union_area_value = union_area(p1, p2)
    print(f"Union area of neighborhoods around {p1} and {p2}: {union_area_value}")
    total_union_area += union_area_value
    count += 1

# Approximate average and integral
avg_union_area = total_union_area / count
# Since the integral is over the domain of pairs, multiply by measure of square cross-product
domain_measure = 1  # area of unit square^2
approx_integral = avg_union_area * domain_measure
# Compute final scaled answer (multiplied by 100 as per formula)
final_answer = approx_integral * 100

print(f"Approximate integral value scaled by 100: {final_answer}")
# The value of 'omnimath2595_answer' is this computed approximate
```
