This problem involves solving the equation \( 2x + 6 = 16 \) for \( x \), then expressing \( x + 4 \). The expected answer should match the value of \( x + 4 \) that satisfies the given equation. To verify and assist in confirming the exact answer, I'll write a Python program enumerating possible solutions around the obvious value and then computing \( x + 4 \).

Since the problem is simple, just solve for \( x \) and output the result immediately.

```python
# Enumerate potential integer solutions for the equation 2x + 6 = 16
# Since it is a straightforward linear equation, directly compute x
for x in range(0, 20):  # small range to ensure completeness
    if 2 * x + 6 == 16:
        answer = x + 4
        print(answer)
```

This code tests all plausible small x-values, finds the matching one, and outputs \( x + 4 \). The expected output is 8, but the code outputs the answer streamingly to confirm correctness.
