This problem involves iterating a quadratic function \( f(x) = x^2 + 6x + 7 \) four times, then finding the least value among the set of all such iterates. To approach this via code, we'll:

- Define the function \(f\).
- Generate a range of real numbers (with small step size) as starting points \(x\).
- For each starting point, compute \(f^{[4]}(x)\) (the fourth iterate).
- Keep track of the minimal value obtained, output intermediate candidates.
- Since the true minimal value might be difficult to find analytically, approximate numerically by sampling.

Here's a concise Python code that searches for the minimal value of the iterative process over a small sample space:

```python
import math

# Define the function and its iterate
def f(x):
    return x**2 + 6*x + 7

def iterate(f, x, times):
    for _ in range(times):
        x = f(x)
    return x

# Search over a small interval with a fine step
min_value = None
step = 0.1
search_range = [-10, 10]

x = search_range[0]
while x <= search_range[1]:
    val = iterate(f, x, 4)
    print(f"Start x={x:.2f} -> 4th iterate={val:.4f}")
    if (min_value is None) or (val < min_value):
        min_value = val
        print(f"New minimum: {val:.4f} at starting point x={x:.2f}")
    x += step

# Final approximate minimal value
print(f"Approximate minimal 4th iterate: {min_value:.4f}")
```
