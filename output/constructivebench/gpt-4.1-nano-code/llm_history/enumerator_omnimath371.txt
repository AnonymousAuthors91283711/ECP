This problem involves finding the least integer \( s \) (or the minimal value of a certain summation) given functions \( a: \text{Fin} 5 \to \mathbb{R} \) with sum 20, where the sum is over pairs with \( j > i \), involving floors of sums of function values.

To approach this, I'll:
- Generate all integer value assignments for \( a(i) \), ensuring their sum is 20.
- For each assignment, compute the specified sum: for \( i<j \), sum \(\lfloor a_i + a_j \rfloor \).
- Track the minimum of these sums.

Since \( a(i) \) are real-valued but the summation involves their *floored sums*, to simplify, I'll consider small rational values that sum to 20, focusing on integer value assignments to cover extreme cases. Because the problem seeks the minimal sum, assign some \( a(i) \) small or zero and scale others, ensuring sum constraint.

Below is the code to explore such possibilities, enumerating candidate solutions to find their summation, streaming answers as needed.

```python
# Enumerate possible assignments of real numbers to a[0..4] with sum 20
# Assume discrete steps for simplicity, e.g., 0 to 20, in increments of 1 or 2
# For efficiency, limit the number of candidates by fixing values for some elements
# and sweeping over others; focus on candidate sums involving floors, so including fractional parts
# To keep within token limit, sample multiple candidate assignments with integer values

def enumerate_candidates():
    min_sum = None
    min_assignments = []
    values = range(0, 21)  # possible integer values for a[i]
    for a0 in values:
        for a1 in values:
            for a2 in values:
                for a3 in values:
                    for a4 in values:
                        total = a0 + a1 + a2 + a3 + a4
                        if total == 20:
                            a = [a0, a1, a2, a3, a4]
                            s = 0
                            # sum over i<j
                            for i in range(5):
                                for j in range(i+1,5):
                                    val = a[i] + a[j]
                                    s += int(val)  # floor since a[i],a[j] integer
                            # print each candidate sum
                            print(f"a={a} sum={s}")
                            if min_sum is None or s < min_sum:
                                min_sum = s
                                min_assignments = [(a, s)]
                            elif s == min_sum:
                                min_assignments.append((a, s))
    print(f"Minimum sum found: {min_sum}")
    for assign, s in min_assignments:
        print(f"Assignment: {assign} yields sum: {s}")

enumerate_candidates()
```
