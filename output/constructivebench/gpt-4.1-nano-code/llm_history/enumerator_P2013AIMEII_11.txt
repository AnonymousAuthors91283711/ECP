The problem essentially asks to find the number of functions \(f : A \to A \) (where \(A = \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\}\)) such that applying \(f\) twice results in a constant function. In other words, for each \(f\), there exists some \(c\in A\) with \(f(f(x))=c\) for all \(x\in A\).

Key insight:
- \(f(f(x))=c\) for all \(x\) means that the image of \(f \circ f\) is a singleton.
- The composition \(f \circ f\) maps all elements into a single value \(c\).
- For a fixed \(c\), the pre-image of each point under \(f\) must satisfy certain structure, leading us to analyze fixed points and 2-cycles.

However, solving combinatorially or via enumeration may be complex directly. Instead, we'll approximate:

- For each possible \(c\) in \(A\), count the number of functions \(f\) such that \(f(f(x))=c\) for all \(x\).

Given the complexity, we'll implement an enumeration in Python to generate functions and verify the condition.

Since the problem asks only for the total count modulo 1000, we focus on counting functions with the property directly by enumeration.

```python
# Enumerate all functions from A to A for small sets
A = list(range(7))
count = 0

# Generate all functions f: A -> A by Cartesian product
from itertools import product

for f_values in product(A, repeat=7):
    f = list(f_values)
    # For each x, compute f(f(x))
    if all(f[f[x]] == c for c in A for x in A):
        # The condition: all f(f(x)) == c for some fixed c (must be same for all x)
        # Check if there exists such c that holds for all x
        c_values = set(f[fx] for fx in f)
        if len(c_values) == 1:
            count += 1

print(count % 1000)
```
