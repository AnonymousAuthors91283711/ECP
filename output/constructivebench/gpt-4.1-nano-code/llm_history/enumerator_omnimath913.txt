The problem involves finding the number of integers n between 1 and 100 for which the sum of n divided by k (from k=1 to n) has an odd integer value. The key is to enumerate n from 1 to 100, compute the sum, and check the parity. The approach focuses on efficiently checking each n without unnecessary overhead.

```python
# Enumerate n from 1 to 100
# For each n, compute sum of n // k for k in 1..n
# Check if the sum is odd, and count such n
# Stream output for each matching n
count = 0
for n in range(1, 101):
    total = 0
    for k in range(1, n+1):
        total += n // k
    if total % 2 == 1:
        print(n)
        count += 1
print("Total count:", count)
```
