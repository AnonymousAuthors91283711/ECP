The problem concerns finding all positive integers n for which there exists an integer m such that (2^n - 1) divides (m^2 + 9). The goal is to enumerate such n values and corresponding m values, exploring small n to conjecture the pattern. We'll test small n values up to a specific threshold, checking for the divisibility condition, and printing solutions as we find them to help with conjecture and proof.

```python
# Enumerate small positive integers n, and check if there exists an integer m
# such that (2^n - 1) divides (m^2 + 9).
# Print all solutions immediately as they are found.

def main():
    max_n = 50  # upper limit for n to keep runtime reasonable
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        divisor = 2**n - 1
        found = False
        # Try m in a symmetric range around 0 for potential solutions
        for m in range(-divisor, divisor + 1):
            if (m * m + 9) % divisor == 0:
                print(f"n = {n}, m = {m}")
                found = True
        if found:
            print(f"With n = {n}, solutions exist.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
