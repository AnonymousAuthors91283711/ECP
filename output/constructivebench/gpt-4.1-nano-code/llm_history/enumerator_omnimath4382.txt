[write_program]
This problem suggests exploring conditions on a set of natural numbers indexed by `Fin n` where certain average and product conditions hold. To assist in conjecturing a solution, I'll write a Python enumeration considering small values of `n` and all possible value configurations of `cards`. The goal is to find possible `cards` values that satisfy the conditions and exhibit patterns that lead to equalities, possibly constraining `cards i = cards j`.

Since the theorem seems to relate the averages to geometric means, typical solutions involve equal elements, so we will test small uniform value configurations and some non-uniform ones up to a threshold.

```python
# Enumerate possible configurations of the "cards" function for small n and small positive values
# Check for patterns where the average equals the geometric mean as per the condition
# We test small n (like 2, 3) and small card values (like 1, 2, 3),
# printing configurations that satisfy the condition, to conjecture when all cards are equal.

import itertools

max_n = 3  # small n for enumeration
max_card_value = 3  # small positive integer values

def check_condition(cards, n):
    # For all pairs i,j, check if there exists a S satisfying the condition
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            found = False
            for size in range(1, n+1):
                for S_indices in itertools.combinations(range(n), size):
                    S = list(S_indices)
                    # Conditions
                    nonempty = len(S) > 0
                    # Compute average
                    avg = (cards[i] + cards[j]) / 2
                    # Compute geometric mean
                    product = 1
                    for k in S:
                        product *= cards[k]
                    geo_mean = product ** (len(S) ** -1)
                    if nonempty and abs(avg - geo_mean) < 1e-6:
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if not found:
                return False
    return True

for n in range(2, max_n+1):
    for cards_values in itertools.product(range(1, max_card_value+1), repeat=n):
        if check_condition(cards_values, n):
            print(f"n={n}, cards={cards_values}")
```
