Ground Truth Answer: 9^36 + 4
Proposed Answer: Fintype.card {s : Fin 36 → Fin 10 | let sum := (univ : Finset (Fin 36)).sum s; (sum % 10) ∉ Set.range s}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct in terms of the mathematical expression and intent, but there's a subtle difference in the formulation. The ground truth answer simplifies the cardinality to \(9^{36} + 4\), while the proposed answer correctly describes the set of functions but doesn't simplify it to the closed-form expression. The conditions are equivalent, but the proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth's simplified form. Hence, it's "Close" but not exactly equivalent.
