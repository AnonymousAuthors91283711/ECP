The problem appears to involve identifying the maximum value of a certain function `olympiadbench2247_answer(x, y)` defined over a domain with bounds on `x` and `y`. The theorem states that 13 is the greatest value of this set. Since the function is marked as sorry (meaning undefined), and the problem asks for enumerating answers, I will assume we're trying to find the maximum of a plausible function over this constrained domain, possibly piecewise or polynomial, consistent with typical Olympiad problems.

Given no explicit function, I will:
- Consider a simple candidate function that could produce a maximum in the given bounds.
- Systematically evaluate at sample points for `x` in [2, 5] and `y` in [10, 20], using small step sizes.
- Output candidates with their `z` values.
- Highlight the candidate with the maximum `z`.

```python
# Since the actual function is unspecified, we assume a sample candidate function.
# For demonstration, we consider a simple function: f(x, y) = x + y, which increases with y and x.

def candidate_function(x, y):
    # As an example, suppose the real function is x + y
    # In real scenarios, this should be replaced with the actual function.
    return x + y

# Domain bounds
x_min, x_max = 2, 5
y_min, y_max = 10, 20

# Step sizes for enumeration
x_step = 0.5
y_step = 2

max_z = float('-inf')
max_point = None

# Enumerate over the domain
x = x_min
while x <= x_max:
    y = y_min
    while y <= y_max:
        z = candidate_function(x, y)
        print(f"Candidate at x={x}, y={y} => z={z}")
        if z > max_z:
            max_z = z
            max_point = (x, y, z)
        y += y_step
    x += x_step

# Output the maximum found
print(f"Maximum candidate: x={max_point[0]}, y={max_point[1]}, z={max_point[2]}")
```
