The problem asks us to find the least natural number m such that m is divisible by 63 and the sum of the digits of 2^m (in base 10) is odd. We need to enumerate candidate values of m to find the minimal one satisfying these conditions.

Approach:
- Iterate over m starting from 1.
- For each m:
  - Check if 63 divides m.
  - Compute 2^m.
  - Sum its decimal digits.
  - Check if this sum is odd.
- When both conditions are met, output m and stop.

This approach guarantees finding the least such m and is efficient enough for small m searches. The program will print each candidate m that satisfies the divisibility, and will stop at the first such m that also has an odd sum of digits of 2^m.

```python
# Enumerate m starting from 1 upwards
m = 1
while True:
    # Check divisibility by 63
    if m % 63 == 0:
        val = 2 ** m
        digit_sum = sum(int(d) for d in str(val))
        # Check if sum of digits is odd
        if digit_sum % 2 == 1:
            print(m)
            break
    m += 1
```
