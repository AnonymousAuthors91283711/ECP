The equation simplifies to \( 2n \times 4 + 2n \times 9 = 2366 \), or \( 8n + 18n = 2366 \), giving \( 26n = 2366 \). The minimal positive \( n \) satisfying this is \( 2366 / 26 = 91 \).

. Enumerated Answers: 91. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The main issues are that in Lean, the `abbrev` definition cannot contain explanatory text or comments directly; it must be an expression of type `ℕ`. The "The equation simplifies..." part is commented out in natural language, but directly included in the definition, causing syntax errors. To fix this, rewrite the answer as a numerical constant corresponding to the derived value, which is 91.

Since the problem computes the minimal positive `n` satisfying the given equation, the answer should be simply the constant number 91. No need for explanations inside the abbreviation; they belong in comments or in proof steps, not in the abbreviation definition.

Therefore, the corrected answer is just the number 91.
