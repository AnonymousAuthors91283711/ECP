Ground Truth Answer: -120
Proposed Answer: -40
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives three equations with variables x, y, z and asks for their sum.
2. The ground truth answer is -120.
3. The proposed answer is -40, which is just the value of x alone.

Looking at the equations:
- The first equation gives x = -40
- The second equation gives y = -35
- The third equation gives z = -45
- Their sum is indeed -40 + (-35) + (-45) = -120

The proposed answer only provides the value of x (-40) but not the sum of all three variables. Therefore, it's incorrect.
