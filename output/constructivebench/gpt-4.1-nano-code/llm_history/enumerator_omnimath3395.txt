The problem involves finding the value of \( k \) such that the slope of the line passing through points \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) is zero. The coordinates are \( p_1 = (3, 2k + 1) \), \( p_2 = (8, 4k - 5) \).

The slope formula: \(\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\)

Given \(x_1=3, y_1=2k+1; x_2=8, y_2=4k-5\).

The slope condition equals zero when numerator \( y_2 - y_1 = 0 \):

\[
(4k - 5) - (2k + 1) = 0
\]
\[
4k - 5 - 2k - 1 = 0
\]
\[
2k - 6 = 0
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

The Python code aims to verify this algebraically and possible values around it.

```python
# The key is to find the value of k for which the slope between p1 and p2 is zero.
# We check for k values within a small range to confirm the solution.

# Since the slope is zero when numerator is zero, directly solve algebraically.
# For demonstration, verify by enumerating candidate k values.

# Parameters
candidate_ks = [k for k in range(-10, 11)]  # small integer range around the expected solution
for k in candidate_ks:
    y1 = 2 * k + 1
    y2 = 4 * k - 5
    numerator = y2 - y1
    # The slope is zero iff numerator == 0
    if numerator == 0:
        print(f"Candidate k = {k}: slope numerator = {numerator} => slope = 0")
        # Confirm the solution
        print(f"Confirmed k = {k} is the solution for the slope being zero.")
```
