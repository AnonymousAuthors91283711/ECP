16: does not satisfy. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The inequality n ^ 200 < 3 ^ 500 suggests finding the largest n > 0 with n ^ 200 < 3 ^ 500. Taking 200th roots: n < (3 ^ 500) ^ (1/200) = 3 ^ (500/200) = 3 ^ 2.5 = 3 ^ 2 * 3 ^ 0.5 = 9 * √3 ≈ 15.588. The greatest integer n < this is 15. 

Answer: 15

<<<15>>>
