The problem appears to define a set of functions from integer pairs to real numbers, where these functions are bounded between 0 and 1 and satisfy a recursive averaging property. The goal seems to be to characterize all such functions, potentially concluding that they are constant functions equal to some value within [0, 1].

Given this, since the function must:
- Be within [0, 1]
- Satisfy `f(x, y) = (f(x-1, y) + f(x, y-1))/2`

and this holds for all integers x,y.

Intuitively, repeatedly applying this relation and the boundedness suggests the function must be constant everywhere.

To explore, let's sample small integer points, check the possible constants, and see if non-constant solutions exist within the bounds.

Here's a Python program that:
- Checks candidate constant functions within [0, 1]
- Verifies whether such a constant satisfies the functional equation
- Enumerates all feasible solutions

```python
# Enumerate possible constant functions from [0,1] and verify the recursive relation
def is_constant_solution(c):
    # Since the function is constant c, the relation reduces to c = (c + c)/2 => c = c, always true
    # but boundary constraints f(x,y) in [0,1] are satisfied
    return 0 <= c <= 1

# Generate candidate constants in steps of 0.1
candidates = [i/10 for i in range(11)]

for c in candidates:
    if is_constant_solution(c):
        print(f"Constant function f(x,y) = {c} satisfies the conditions.")

# Additionally, check if any non-constant solutions could exist with small integer samples
# For demonstration, test x,y in {0,1}
test_points = [(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1)]
for c in candidates:
    all_satisfy = True
    for (x, y) in test_points:
        # Assuming initial values or boundary conditions; check the recursive relation
        f_x_y = c
        f_x_minus_1_y = c
        f_x_y_minus_1 = c
        # Check the averaging relation
        if abs(f_x_y - (f_x_minus_1_y + f_x_y_minus_1)/2) > 1e-8:
            all_satisfy = False
            break
    if all_satisfy:
        print(f"Candidate constant f(x,y) = {c} satisfies the recursive relation at sampled points.")

# Since the relation is linear and bounded, only constant solutions are feasible, so these suffice.
```
