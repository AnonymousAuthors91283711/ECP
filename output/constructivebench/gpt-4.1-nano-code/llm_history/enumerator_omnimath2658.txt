This problem asks to find the number of integers n, where 0 < n < 10!, such that n can be written as the sum of four factorials: n = a! + b! + c! + d!. The task is to count all such n (the cardinality of this set). Since factorials grow rapidly, and 10! = 3,628,800, we can efficiently enumerate all quadruples of factorials up to 10!, then record all unique sums that satisfy the conditions.

Key points:
- Use small sample factorials from 0! to 9! (since 10! is the upper bound and 10! > 10).
- Generate all quadruples of factorials (a!, b!, c!, d!).
- Collect sums that are less than 10! and greater than 0.
- Count unique sums.

This enumeration is feasible because factorials from 0! to 9! are manageable in number (~10^4 combinations).

```python
# Enumerate factorials from 0! to 9!
import math

factorials = [math.factorial(i) for i in range(10)]
limit = math.factorial(10)  # 10! = 3,628,800

sums_set = set()

# Generate all quadruples of factorials
for a in factorials:
    for b in factorials:
        for c in factorials:
            for d in factorials:
                s = a + b + c + d
                if 0 < s < limit:
                    if s not in sums_set:
                        print(s)  # Output each found sum immediately
                        sums_set.add(s)

# Output the total count of unique sums found
print("Count:", len(sums_set))
```
