The problem involves two lines: `line1(x) = 2x + 6` and `line2(x) = -4x + 6`. The key is to find the absolute difference between their x-intercepts, which are at points where each line crosses the x-axis (i.e., where the function equals zero).

- For line1: `2x + 6 = 0` → `x = -3`
- For line2: `-4x + 6 = 0` → `x = 3/2`

The absolute difference between these intercepts is `|(-3) - (3/2)|`. To enumerate answers, we straightforwardly compute this difference.

Here is a Python program that illustrates this process:

```python
# Compute and print the x-intercepts of the two lines
x1 = -6 / 2  # from line1: 2x + 6 = 0
x2 = 6 / (-4)  # from line2: -4x + 6 = 0

# Calculate the absolute difference
difference = abs(x1 - x2)
print(difference)

# For clarity, also output the intercepts
print("x-intercept of line1:", x1)
print("x-intercept of line2:", x2)
```

This enumerates the key answer (the difference) immediately, along with the intercepts, assisting in understanding and verifying the problem's solution.
