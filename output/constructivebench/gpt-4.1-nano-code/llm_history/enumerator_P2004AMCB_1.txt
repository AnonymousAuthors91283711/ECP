The problem asks to find the unique natural number x such that x * 2^4 = 48. Since 2^4 = 16, the equation reduces to x * 16 = 48, or x = 48 / 16 = 3. The goal is to enumerate all potential candidates for x and verify the only solution.

```python
# Enumerate all x from 0 to 10 to find those satisfying x * 16 = 48.
# Since the problem is simple, direct computation suffices.
for x in range(11):
    if x * 16 == 48:
        print(f"x = {x}")
```

This code will immediately print the value x = 3 as the solution when run.
