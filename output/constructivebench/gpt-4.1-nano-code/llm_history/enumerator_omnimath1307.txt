[write_program]
This problem appears to involve modular arithmetic with very large numbers, specifically calculating a large number modulo a smaller number. Since the problem requests enumerating possible answers and does not specify the exact answer, I will implement a Python script that computes the modulo of the large number with the smaller one directly and then prints the result immediately. The approach relies on Python's arbitrary-precision integers to handle the large number efficiently. 

Given the context, the program will:
- Define the large number and the smaller modulus.
- Compute the remainder directly.
- Print the answer immediately upon calculation.

This straightforward approach is efficient and leverages Python's built-in arbitrary precision, fulfilling the requirement to print streaming results and avoid unnecessary computations.

```python
# Large number and modulus based on the problem statement
large_num_str = "10002000400080016003200640128025605121024204840968192"
modulus_str = "100020004000800160032"

# Convert strings to integers
large_num = int(large_num_str)
modulus = int(modulus_str)

# Compute the remainder (large number mod modulus)
answer = large_num % modulus

# Print the answer immediately
print(answer)
```
