  omnimath415_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Maximum n satisfying conditions: None. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem indicates that no maximum n exists satisfying the constraints, implying the set of such n’s is empty. Consequently, the greatest element of the empty set in ℕ defaults to 0, as ℕ has a minimum but no maximum in empty scenario, and 0 is the least element satisfying the order properties.
