The problem appears to involve finding triples of prime numbers \((p, q, r)\) satisfying the equation \(3p^4 - 5q^4 - 4r^2 = 26\). Since \(p, q, r\) are prime, and the equation involves high powers, a feasible approach is to test small primes up to some limit, check if they satisfy the equation, and record those solutions.

Given the constraints, we'll:
- test small primes up to, say, 30,
- check all triples \((p, q, r)\),
- if the equation holds, print the solution immediately.

This approach prioritizes finding solutions quickly, avoids heavy computations, and is straightforward to implement.

```python
# List small primes up to 30 for testing
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]

# Iterate over all triples (p, q, r)
for p in primes:
    p_pow4 = p**4
    for q in primes:
        q_pow4 = q**4
        for r in primes:
            r_squared = r**2
            lhs = 3 * p_pow4 - 5 * q_pow4 - 4 * r_squared
            if lhs == 26:
                print((p, q, r))
```
