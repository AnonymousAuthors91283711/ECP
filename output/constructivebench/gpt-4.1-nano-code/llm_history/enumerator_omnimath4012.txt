The problem asks to find all functions \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying the functional equation:

\[ f(x)f(y) = x f(f(y - x)) + x f(2x) + f(x^2) \]

for all real \(x, y\).

Since the full formal problem seems complex, let's focus on enumerating potential solutions by testing simple function candidates such as affine functions, constant functions, and zero functions over small sample values, and check the equation for many specific inputs. We will:

- Test constant functions \(f(x) = c\).
- Test \(f(x) = kx\) for linear functions.
- Plug these into the equation for small integer and fractional values of \(x, y\).

This approach helps in conjecturing the solutions or ruling out classes of functions.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions and check the given functional equation
# for various small real inputs to discover solutions.

import math

# Define small test inputs
test_inputs = [0, 1, -1, 0.5, -0.5]

# Candidate functions
def constant(c):
    return lambda x: c

def linear(k):
    return lambda x: k * x

# Check functional equation for given f
def check_f(f):
    for x in test_inputs:
        for y in test_inputs:
            lhs = f(x) * f(y)
            # Compute rhs
            rhs = x * f(f(y - x)) + x * f(2 * x) + f(x ** 2)
            # Allow small numerical tolerance
            if not math.isclose(lhs, rhs, rel_tol=1e-8, abs_tol=1e-8):
                return False
    return True

# Enumerate constant functions c = 0, 1, -1, 2, -2
constants = [0, 1, -1, 2, -2]
for c in constants:
    f = constant(c)
    if check_f(f):
        print(f"Constant function f(x) = {c} satisfies the equation.")

# Enumerate linear functions kx with k in small set
ks = [-1, 0, 1]
for k in ks:
    f = linear(k)
    if check_f(f):
        print(f"Linear function f(x) = {k} * x satisfies the equation.")
