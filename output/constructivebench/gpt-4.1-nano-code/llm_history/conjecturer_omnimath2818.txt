The problem seeks the minimal N for a sequence of integers over an interval [k, k+N−1], such that the product of all integers in that interval is divisible by 2010². To ensure divisibility by 2010² = 2² * 3² * 5² * 67², the interval must contain at least 2, 3, 5, and 67 each squared. The minimal N should encompass the spacing needed to ensure the highest prime powers, mainly focusing on the largest prime, 67, which appears squared. The smallest interval starting at the smallest k that guarantees the presence of the necessary prime factors is of length 67, covering 67 * (61 – 1), so N=67. The minimal N equals this value.

<<<67>>>
