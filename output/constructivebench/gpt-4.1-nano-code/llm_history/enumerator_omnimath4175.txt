This problem involves exploring functions \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying the functional equation:

\[
f(xy) \cdot (f(x) - f(y)) = (x - y) \cdot f(x) \cdot f(y)
\]

We want to enumerate possible solutions \(f\). Typical functions satisfying such functional equations include constant functions and certain multiplicative or additive forms. To assist conjecture, we will check some simple candidate functions directly and systematically.

Candidates to test:
- Constant functions: \(f(x) = c\)
- Linear functions: \(f(x) = kx\)
- The zero function: \(f(x) = 0\)
- The identity: \(f(x) = x\)

We will test these over small numeric sample points (like \(x, y\) in \(\{-1, 0, 1, 2\}\)), and all candidates solutions that satisfy the functional equation consistently.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions and test them on small sample points.
def test_function(f):
    test_points = [-1, 0, 1, 2]
    for x in test_points:
        for y in test_points:
            # Avoid division or zero multiplications issues
            try:
                lhs = f(x * y) * (f(x) - f(y))
                rhs = (x - y) * f(x) * f(y)
                # Compare with an exact or approximate check
                if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-8:
                    return False
            except Exception:
                return False
    return True

solutions = []

# Constant solutions: f(x) = c
for c in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    def f_const(x, c=c):
        return c
    if test_function(f_const):
        solutions.append(f_const)
        print(f"Constant function: f(x) = {c}")

# Zero function
def zero_func(x):
    return 0
if test_function(zero_func):
    solutions.append(zero_func)
    print("Zero function: f(x) = 0")

# Identity function: f(x) = x
def identity(x):
    return x
if test_function(identity):
    solutions.append(identity)
    print("Identity function: f(x) = x")

# Linear: f(x) = kx for small k
for k in [-1, 0.5, 2]:
    def linear(x, k=k):
        return k * x
    if test_function(linear):
        solutions.append(linear)
        print(f"Linear function: f(x) = {k} * x")

# The output list may include the functions found
# Since the problem is theoretical, these are the candidate solutions
```
