The problem involves characterizing functions \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying a certain functional equation for all positive real inputs. The functional equation looks like a relation involving sums of squares and ratios, with an inequality constraint \(f(x) > 0\) for positive \(x\).

Given the structure, a key approach is to test simple candidate functions, especially for extremal or constant solutions. Since the problem asks for the set of functions satisfying the condition, and the negligible function such as zero is invalid (due to the condition \(f(x) > 0\)), typical solutions might include linear functions like \(f(x) = c x\), or constant functions \(f(x) = c\) with \(c > 0\).

To automate this, the code will enumerate simple candidate functions, parameterized over small integers or rational ratios, especially linear functions \(f(x) = a x\) for \(a > 0\).

We will:
- Test the candidate functions over small sample points \((w, x, y, z)\) with positive values.
- Check if the functional relation holds exactly or approximately.
- Search for possible constant functions \(f(x) = c > 0\).

This enumeration will help to conjecture the possible classes of solutions.

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample parameters for candidate functions
# Testing f(x) = c*x with c > 0
candidates = [0.5, 1.0, 2.0]

# Sample points for w, x, y, z > 0
samples = [
    (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0),
    (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5),
    (2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0),
    (1.2, 3.4, 5.6, 7.8),
]

for c in candidates:
    for (w, x, y, z) in samples:
        if w > 0 and x > 0 and y > 0 and z > 0:
            # Compute the ratio according to the functional equation
            numerator_left = (c * w)**2 + (c * x)**2
            denominator_left = c * (y**2) + c * (z**2)
            ratio_left = numerator_left / denominator_left

            numerator_right = w**2 + x**2
            denominator_right = y**2 + z**2
            ratio_right = numerator_right / denominator_right

            diff = abs(ratio_left - ratio_right)
            # If the difference is very small, function satisfies the relation approximately
            if diff < 1e-8:
                print(f"Candidate function: f(x) = {c} * x")
                print(f"For sample (w={w}, x={x}, y={y}, z={z}), ratio difference: {diff}")
```
