This problem involves solving a system of equations with natural numbers:

1. \( x \times y = 24 \)
2. \( x - y = 5 \)

We need to find \( x + y \), but since we want to explore and confirm the answer, we will programmatically enumerate all possible pairs \((x, y)\) satisfying the first equation (with \(x, y \in \mathbb{N}\)), then check the second equation. For each valid pair, we compute the sum \(x + y\). 

By doing this, we can determine the result and observe whether the second condition \(x - y = 5\) holds for each candidate. We will print the candidate sums as we find them to assist in conjecturing the exact value.

```python
# Enumerate positive factor pairs of 24
for x in range(1, 25):
    if 24 % x == 0:
        y = 24 // x
        # Check if the difference matches 5
        if x - y == 5:
            sum_xy = x + y
            print(f"Found pair (x={x}, y={y}) with sum {sum_xy}")
```
