The problem appears to involve finding a unique natural number satisfying the equation \( 2 \times (x + 7) - 4 = 28 \). To assist in conjecturing and proving the answer, I'll write a Python script that efficiently searches for solutions within a plausible range, streamlining the process to identify the exact solution.

This script:
- Checks candidate values within a small range (0 to 100) for simplicity.
- Prints each solution immediately when found.
- Shows the reasoning to determine the unique solution satisfying the equation.

```python
# Enumerate candidate natural numbers x from 0 to 100
for x in range(101):
    # Compute left side of the equation
    result = 2 * (x + 7) - 4
    # Check if it equals 28
    if result == 28:
        print(f"Found candidate: x = {x} (since 2*({x} + 7) - 4 = {result})")
        # Continue to verify uniqueness later if needed
        # For now, print all candidates within the range
```
