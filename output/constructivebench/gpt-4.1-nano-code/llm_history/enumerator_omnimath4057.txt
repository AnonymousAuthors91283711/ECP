The problem appears to involve finding the minimal size of a finite set of integers within a certain range such that the set contains three distinct elements summing to zero. Given parameters a and b, and integers within the interval [-a, b], we want to output the least m for which such a set exists.

Since the task asks for enumerations and maximum efficiency, we will:
- Select small sample values of a, b.
- For each size m starting from 3 upwards (since three elements are needed to sum to zero), generate candidate sets within the range.
- Check if any 3 elements in the set sum to zero.
- As soon as we find the minimal m that works, stream the answer.

Below is a Python program that accomplishes this:

```python
# Enumerate small values of a and b
a_values = [1, 2]
b_values = [1, 2]
# For simplicity, test small ranges
for a in a_values:
    for b in b_values:
        print(f"Testing for a={a}, b={b}")
        min_m_found = None
        # Start from m=3 since we need three elements
        for m in range(3, 20):
            found = False
            # Generate all subsets of size m in the range [-a, b]
            # Since generating all sets of size m is large, generate all combinations of nums in range
            range_values = range(-a, b+1)
            from itertools import combinations
            for s in combinations(range_values, m):
                # Check if any three distinct elements sum to zero
                for triplet in combinations(s, 3):
                    if sum(triplet) == 0:
                        print(f"Answer for m={m}: set {s}")
                        found = True
                        min_m_found = m
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if found:
                # minimal m found, print and move on
                print(f"Minimal m={min_m_found} for a={a}, b={b}")
                break
```

This code:
- Tests small a, b values.
- Enumerates sets of increasing size, checking triplets.
- Streams each found answer immediately.
- Stops once the minimal m is identified.

You can run this code to generate partial hypotheses and possibly conjecture the minimal set size for the problem.
