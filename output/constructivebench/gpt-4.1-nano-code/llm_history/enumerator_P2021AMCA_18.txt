This problem appears to be a functional equation involving a function \( f: \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q} \) with multiplicativity-like behavior and specific values at primes. We are asked to determine an answer for a particular value and show that \( f(\text{answer}) < 0 \).

Given the properties:
- \( f(a \times b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for positive rationals \( a, b \),
- \( f(p) = p \) for prime \( p \),
  
it's reminiscent of a logarithmic function, since addition corresponds to multiplication. The condition \( f(p)=p \) for primes suggests \( f \) aligns with \( f(x) = \log(x) \) scaled and shifted, at least for positive rationals. 

Our goal: identify the particular value \( P_{2021AMCA18\_answer} \) that makes the statement \( f(\text{answer}) < 0 \) true. Without a fixed point, we suspect the answer might be the rational number for which the functional property guides us to a particular value.

### Approach:
- The functional equation resembles that of \( f(x) = c \cdot \log x \).
- For primes \( p \), \( f(p) = p \). But \( f(p) \) relates to \( c \log p \), hence \( c \log p = p \Rightarrow c = p / \log p \).
- Since this can't hold for all primes simultaneously unless \( c \) varies, a consistent solution for \( f \) is \( f(x) = \log x \) (up to additive constants).

### Guess: the value at which \( f \) becomes negative is a small rational less than 1, where the logarithm is negative. For example, \( 1/2 \).

### Implementation:
- Confirm the behavior of \( f \) at \( 1/2 \): \( f(1/2) \) should be negative if \( f(x) \approx \log x \).
- Enumerate candidates around small rationals to see which satisfy \( f(a) < 0 \).

### Code:
```python
import math

# We approximate f as proportional to log, consistent with given conditions
# Let's examine candidates for answer around 0 < a < 1
candidates = [1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/10, 1/100]

for a in candidates:
    val = math.log(a)  # approximate f(a)
    print(f"Candidate a = {a}, f(a) â‰ˆ log(a) = {val}")
    if val < 0:
        print(f"f({a}) < 0 confirmed.")
```

This code approximates \( f \) via the natural logarithm, tests small rational numbers less than 1, and immediately outputs candidates where \( f(a) < 0 \), fitting the requirements.
