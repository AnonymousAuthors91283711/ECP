theorem P2008AMCB_12 (seq : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ n, 0 < n → (∑ k in Finset.range n, seq k) / n = n) → seq 2008 = P2008AMCB_12_answer 2008 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 4015. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The pattern suggests the answer involves a quadratic polynomial in n, matching the pattern 2n + n (2n + 1) / 2, which simplifies to n(n + 1). Since the only enumerated answer is 4015 for n=2008, I deduce the pattern is close to n(n + 1) + c, with c determined by the context. Given the pattern and the large value, the plausible formula is n^2 + 2n, which evaluated at n=2008 gives 2008^2 + 2*2008 = 4,032,064 + 4,016 = 4,036,080, but close to 4015 suggests another constant.

Considering the pattern and the value 4015, dividing by n: 4015/2008 ≈ 2, which supports just using n + 2 as an answer. Given the small discrepancy, the closed form matching guessed pattern is 2n + 1.

Thus, the answer is:

<<<fun n : ℕ => 2 * n + 1>>>
