theorem omnimath336 (n : ℕ) :
  let 𝒮 := {S : Fin (n+1) × Fin (n+1) → Finset (Fin (2*n)) | 
    (∀ i j, (S (i, j)).card = i.1 + j.1) ∧
    (∀ i j k l, i.1 ≤ k.1 → j.1 ≤ l.1 → S (i, j) ⊆ S (k, l))}
  Fintype.card 𝒮 = omnimath336_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=1 => number of functions: 0
n=2 => number of functions: 0
n=3 => number of functions: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The pattern indicates all tested cases (n=1,2,3) yield 0. Given the constraints, no valid functions satisfy the properties for these small n, likely extending for all n. Thus, the formula is constantly 0 regardless of n.
