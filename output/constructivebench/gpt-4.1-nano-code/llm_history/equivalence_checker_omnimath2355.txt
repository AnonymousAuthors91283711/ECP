Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n - 2
Proposed Answer: fun n => max 0 (n - 2)
<<<True>>>

The proposed answer `fun n => max 0 (n - 2)` is equivalent to the ground truth answer `fun n => n - 2` for all natural numbers n ≥ 2 (as specified in the theorem's hypothesis). Since n ≥ 2, n - 2 will always be ≥ 0, making the max operation redundant. Both functions will return exactly the same result for all valid inputs.
