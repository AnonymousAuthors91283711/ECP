The problem references the set of multisets of size 9 drawn from 26 distinct elements (like letters in the alphabet). This is a classic combinatorial problem of counting multisets (combinations with repetition). The number of such multisets is given by the formula:

\[
\binom{n + k - 1}{k}
\]

where \( n = 26 \) (elements to choose from), and \( k = 9 \) (size of each multiset). 

In particular, this computes the number of multisets of size 9 from 26 distinct elements.

```python
from math import comb

# Define the parameters
n = 26  # number of distinct elements (e.g., alphabet letters)
k = 9   # size of each multiset

# Compute the total number of multisets (combinations with repetition)
answer = comb(n + k - 1, k)

# Print the result
print(answer)
```
