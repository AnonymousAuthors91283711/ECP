This problem appears to define a functional equation involving rational functions, with the goal of finding all functions `f : ℚ → ℚ` satisfying the given relation. The Python script will attempt to explore candidate functions—possible rational functions—that satisfy the functional relation, by testing specific forms and parameters, then producing candidate solutions that meet the constraints.

Given the structure, I will:

- Assume functions of the form `f(x) = c * x^k` where `c ∈ ℚ` and `k ∈ ℤ` or rational exponents (for simplicity, focus initially on polynomial/rational forms).
- For small sample values, generate candidate functions, check the functional equation for some sample inputs, and print solutions that match the relation.
- Prioritize exact rational outputs.

Here's a streamlined enumeration approach:

```python
# Enumerate simple rational functions of the form f(x) = c * x^k with rational c and integer k
# Check whether the functional equation holds for a few sample rational inputs
# For plausible candidates, output their formula

import fractions

# Sample rational values for constants c and exponents k
c_candidates = [fractions.Fraction(i, j) for i in range(-3, 4) for j in range(1, 4)]
k_candidates = range(-2, 3)

# Sample points to test the functional equation
test_points = [
    (fractions.Fraction(1, 2), fractions.Fraction(1, 3)),
    (fractions.Fraction(2, 3), fractions.Fraction(3, 4)),
    (fractions.Fraction(3, 2), fractions.Fraction(4, 5)),
]

for c in c_candidates:
    for k in k_candidates:
        # Define candidate function
        def f(x, c=c, k=k):
            return c * (x ** k)
        # Check the functional equation at sample points
        valid = True
        for x, y in test_points:
            # Ensure x>0 and y>0
            if x <= 0 or y <= 0:
                continue
            lhs = f(f(x) ** 2 * y)
            rhs = f(x * y) * x ** 3
            # If they are not exactly equal, discard
            if lhs != rhs:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            # Found a candidate form
            print(f"Candidate: f(x) = {c} * x^{k}")
```
