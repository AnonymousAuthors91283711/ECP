This problem involves finding the smallest integer `n` such that the infima (least upper bounds) of certain sets based on parameter solutions differ, which is related to Frobenius coin problems or coverage of integers with linear combinations. Since the code references infima over parameterized solutions involving linear equations with coefficients 6, 10, 7, and 12, a common approach is to systematically search for such `n` and corresponding `p`.

We will enumerate small values of `n`, compute the sets of `p` where the equations hold, determine their infimums, and check when these infima differ, indicating the minimal `n` satisfying the property.

Here's a Python code snippet to perform this enumeration efficiently:

```python
# Enumerate n from small values onwards
# For each n, find the minimal p satisfying the equations
# Then check if the minimal p for n+2 is less than for n
# When this happens, record the n
# Since the set involves linear Diophantine equations, we can iterate over possible a, b

def find_inf_p(n):
    # Find minimal p for given n with some a, b satisfying 6a + 10b = n
    min_p = None
    for a in range(n//6 + 1):
        for b in range((n - 6*a)//10 + 1):
            if 6*a + 10*b == n:
                # For given a,b, p = 7a + 12b
                p = 7*a + 12*b
                if (min_p is None) or (p < min_p):
                    min_p = p
    return min_p

max_n = 100  # limit search to small n
for n in range(max_n):
    p_n = find_inf_p(n)
    p_n2 = find_inf_p(n + 2)
    if p_n is not None and p_n2 is not None:
        if p_n2 < p_n:
            print(f"n = {n} with p(n) = {p_n}, p(n+2) = {p_n2}")
            break
```

This script enumerates small `n` to find the minimal `p` satisfying the conditions, checks when the minimal `p` for `n+2` drops below that for `n`, prints each such `n` as soon as it's detected, and stops after finding the minimal such `n`. It efficiently searches over small parameters and terminates early, respecting all constraints.

The problem involves checking whether, for some n, the minimal p satisfying the given linear Diophantine conditions for n+2 is less than that for n. The current code iterates over n up to 100, searches for the minimal p for each n, then compares p(n) and p(n+2). If p(n+2) < p(n), it prints n.

Observations:
- The original code stops at the first n where the inequality holds, which appears acceptable.
- The search space for a, b is small, but potentially misses some solutions if the bounds are too tightâ€”though within max_n=100, it should be fine.
- The code uses find_inf_p to find minimal p for each n correctly.
- The initial program output indicates no answer was found ("Error: Program outputs empty result"), suggesting that the code does not find any such n within the range.

Given the problem's nature, it's likely that the minimal p for n and n+2 are often not such that p(n+2) < p(n). Therefore, the code might not output any answer within this range.

Acceptance Criterion:
The enumerated answer is empty, but the problem likely expects to find the minimal n satisfying the condition. The existing code handles that structure, but is limited here.

Accordingly:
- The code is logically correct in the approach, but it stops at first found n, which is acceptable.

Conclusion:
Because no such n was found in the original code's range, and the problem statement seems to expect an answer, but program outputs nothing, it should be rejected for incomplete coverage.

Hence, the program must be modified to:
- Search for the minimal such n rather than stopping early,
- Extend the range if necessary,
- And print the answer explicitly after the search completes.

**Accepted?**: <<<False>>>

**Corrected Program:**
```python
# Enumerate n from small values upwards to find the minimal n where p(n+2) < p(n)
def find_inf_p(n):
    min_p = None
    for a in range(n//6 + 2):  # extend range slightly
        for b in range((n - 6*a)//10 + 2):
            if 6*a + 10*b == n:
                p = 7*a + 12*b
                if (min_p is None) or (p < min_p):
                    min_p = p
   
[refine_program]
The problem appears to be a formal math theorem involving the minimal values related to solutions of certain integer equations, but the provided code is incomplete and contains only placeholders (`sorry`, `None`, and an empty program). The output indicates that no answers are enumerated because no code exists.

**Judgement:**
- Since the code is entirely missing and the runtime output is "Error: Program is empty," the program does not produce any answers or handle enumeration.
- The instructions specify that the code should enumerate answers and output them immediately as they are found, especially all relevant candidates up to some threshold, and be self-contained (no input required).
- The current code is invalid and does not meet these requirements.

**Conclusion:**
- The original program is rejected because it does not implement any logic or enumeration.

**Corrected Solution:**

Given the problem structure, the apparent goal is to find integers \( n \) for which the minimal \( p \) satisfying certain linear equations changes (i.e., where the \( \inf \) (greatest lower bound) of solutions decreases when \( n \) increases by 2). This resembles a Frobenius-type problem related to linear combinations of 6 and 10 for \( a, b \), and examining their minimal \( p \) values for varied \( n \).

Since the problem is about enumeration and minimal solutions, the corrected code will:
- Choose small \( n \) values (say, from 0 to 30 for simplicity).
- For each \( n \), compute \( P \) and \( P' \):
   - \( P \) corresponds to minimal \( p \) satisfying some linear constraints.
   - \( P' \) for \( n+2 \).
- Check where \( P' < P \), output these \( n \) and the values.

Here's a simplified approach implementing the enumeration:

```python
import math

def min_p(n):
    min_p_value = math.inf
    # Search for non-negative integers a, b satisfying 6a + 10b = n
    for a in range(n // 6 + 2):
        for b in range(n // 10 + 2):
            if 6 * a + 10 * b == n:
                # For each solution (a, b), compute p satisfying 7a + 12b = p
                p = 7 * a + 12 * b
                if p <
