The problem involves a recurrence relation and the behavior of the sequence as n tends to infinity, resembling a second-order linear recurrence. The task is to find the limit behavior or specific parameters that satisfy the convergence condition, based on the recurrence:

\[ E(k) = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } k \leq 0 \\
1 + \frac{E(k-1) + E(k-2)}{2} & \text{if } k > 0
\end{cases} \]

This has the form of a linear recurrence, suggesting a solution of the form \(E(k) \sim A \cdot r^k + B\), where \(A, B\) are constants.

To analyze the general solution, we consider the homogeneous part:
\[ E(k) - \frac{1}{2} E(k-1) - \frac{1}{2} E(k-2) = 0 \]
with characteristic equation:
\[ r^2 - \frac{1}{2} r - \frac{1}{2} = 0 \]
solving for roots.

For the particular solution, we examine the constant term introduced by the "+1" in the recurrence. Setting \(E(k) = C\):

\[ C = 1 + \frac{C+C}{2} \Rightarrow C = 1 + C \Rightarrow 0 = 1 \]

which is inconsistent unless we consider the homogeneous solution.

Numerical computation for small k suggests the sequence may tend to a linear function of k of the form \(E(k) \sim a k + b\). Testing this form numerically suggests that the limit of \(E(k) - c \cdot k\) approaches some constant.

Now, implementing a small enumerator to approximate constants for the linear part:

```python
# Approximate solutions to the recurrence using initial conditions
# We simulate the recurrence for small k to infer the linear behavior as k -> âˆž.

def compute_sequence(num_terms):
    E = [0, 0]  # E(0)=0, E(1)=0
    for k in range(2, num_terms):
        E_k = 1 + (E[k-1] + E[k-2]) / 2
        E.append(E_k)
        print(f"E({k}) = {E_k}")
    return E

# Compute first 20 terms to observe the trend
sequence = compute_sequence(20)

# Observe differences to find linear growth rate
differences = [sequence[k+1] - sequence[k] for k in range(len(sequence)-1)]
print("Differences between consecutive terms:", differences)

# Approximate the trend: mean of last few differences
approx_slope = sum(differences[-5:]) / 5
print(f"Approximate linear growth (slope): {approx_slope}")

# The sequence seems to grow roughly linearly with slope approx_slope
# Hence, the limit of E(n) - slope * n should be finite.
```
