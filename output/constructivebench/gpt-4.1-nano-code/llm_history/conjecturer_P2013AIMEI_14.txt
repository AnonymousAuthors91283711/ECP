    ∃ m n : ℕ, Nat.Coprime m n ∧ sin θ = -↑m / ↑n ∧ m + n = P2013AIMEI_14_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found candidate: m=7, n=10, sum=17
Found candidate: m=9, n=13, sum=22
Found candidate: m=11, n=16, sum=27
Found candidate: m=16, n=23, sum=39
Found candidate: m=19, n=27, sum=46
Found candidate: m=20, n=29, sum=49
Possible candidates (m, n): [(7, 10), (9, 13), (11, 16), (16, 23), (19, 27), (20, 29)]. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the enumerated candidates and their sums, the pattern suggests increasing sums. The candidate with the smallest sum is (7,10), sum=17, which likely matches the pattern. Thus, the closed-form sum for (m,n) could be 17, aligning with the smallest candidate satisfying the conditions.
