The problem appears to involve a function `f` that, given a positive real number `x`, returns the number of primes `p` such that `x ≤ p ≤ x + 10`. The theorem then asks to evaluate `f (f 20)`. Since `f x` counts such primes, the task involves:

1. Computing `f 20`, which is the number of primes from 20 to 30.
2. Then, applying `f` again to that value, which involves counting primes in an interval starting from that number to that number + 10.

To assist, we'll generate all candidate prime counts for small integers in a manageable range, explicitly enumerating the number of primes in each interval. This will help us understand what values `f` might take and allow us to determine `f(f 20)`.

For simplicity, select small sample values: for example, check `x` from 20 to 30; then for the resulting `f 20`, use that value to determine the second application.

```python
from sympy import primerange
# Precompute prime counts for x in 20..30 to facilitate understanding
prime_counts = {}
for x in range(20, 31):
    count = len(list(primerange(x, x + 11)))  # [x, x+10]
    prime_counts[x] = count
    print(f"f({x}) = {count}")

# Determine f(20)
f_20 = prime_counts[20]
print(f"f(20) = {f_20}")

# Now compute f(f(20))
# For the value f_20, find primes in [f_20, f_20+10]
result_range_start = f_20
result_range_end = f_20 + 10
# Check for possible prime counts within the sample range
possible_counts = []
for x in range(result_range_start, result_range_end + 1):
    # For x as an integer, count primes in [x, x+10]
    count = len(list(primerange(x, x + 11)))
    possible_counts.append(count)
    print(f"Number of primes in [{x}, {x+10}] = {count}")
# The value of f(f 20) is one of the counts in possible_counts
```
