The problem appears to involve enumerating all triples of positive integers \((a, b, c)\) with certain conditions, specifically:

- \(a, b, c > 0\),
- \(a \leq b \leq c\),
- \(\gcd(a, \gcd(b, c)) = 1\),
- \(a \times b \times c = 6^{2020}\).

The goal is to find the value of \(\text{cardinality}(N)\) where \(N\) is the set of all such triples, and then compute \(N \bmod 1000\).

Since \(6^{2020} = (2 \times 3)^{2020} = 2^{2020} \times 3^{2020}\), the prime factorization is unique.

To find all triples \((a, b, c)\), note:

- Each \(a, b, c\) is a product of powers of 2 and 3 only, because of the prime factorization.
- The exgcd condition implies that \(\gcd(a, \gcd(b, c)) = 1\). This implies that the prime factors are disjoint among the triples, i.e., no prime divides more than one among \(a, b, c\).

Thus, for each triple:

- The distribution of prime factors \(2^{2020} \times 3^{2020}\) among \(a, b, c\) must be such that each prime's total exponents sum to 2020, and no prime appears in more than one of the triple's components.

In particular, the only example:

- Each prime exponent (2020 for 2 and 3) is partitioned among \(a, b, c\) into three non-negative integers:

\[
x_a + x_b + x_c = 2020
\]
for each prime, with the condition that:

- For prime 2: exponents \(\alpha_a, \alpha_b, \alpha_c\), summing to 2020,
- For prime 3: exponents \(\beta_a, \beta_b, \beta_c\), summing to 2020,
- and the supports of these exponents are disjoint because of the gcd condition.

The gcd condition \(\gcd(a, \gcd(b, c))= 1\) implies that:

- For each prime, only one of the three numbers contains that prime’s factor (i.e., exponents for each prime are assigned entirely to one of \(a, b, c\)). Because otherwise, the gcd would include that prime.

Thus, for each prime:

- The three exponents \(\alpha_a, \alpha_b, \alpha_c\) form a partition of 2020 where *exactly one* of \(\alpha_a, \alpha_b, \alpha_c\) is non-zero (and the others are zero), and the sum is 2020. Similarly for the exponents of 3.

In effect, for each prime, the distribution corresponds to choosing one of the three positions (a, b, c) to hold all the exponents (2020), and the other two zeros.

**Number of ways:**

- For 2: 3 ways (assign all 2020 to \(a\), or all to \(b\), or all to \(c\))
- For 3: same, 3 ways.

Total combinations:

\[
\text{Total} = 3 \times 3 = 9
\]

**Counting only those triples with \(a \leq b \leq c\):**

- Since the exponents are either all zero or all 2020 for each prime (and exactly one prime per position), the number of triples in order depends on the arrangements of these prime assignments:
  - For each of the 9 combinations, the triple \((a, b, c)\) is determined, with \(a, b, c\) being products of 2’s and 3’s exponents, i.e., either \(2^{2020}\), \(3^{2020}\), or 1.

- For ordering, consider all arrangements of the assignments:

Each of the three primes is assigned to exactly one of \(a, b, c\), with all possible permutations of these assignments.

But since we only want ordered triples with \(a \leq b \leq c\), count the number of permutations corresponding to this order.

- For each prime, the exponents are assigned to a position \(A, B, C\). The total number of assignment patterns is 9, as above.

- For each pattern, we derive \(a, b, c\).

- The order \(a \leq b \leq c\) constrains the assignment: assign the primes' exponents accordingly, and count only the arrangements where the resulting numbers satisfy the ordering.

Alternatively, note that:

- The exact combination where all three assignments are such that the assigned exponents produce an ordered triple \(a \leq b \leq c\).

Given the symmetry, we can enumerate all possible triples from the 9 sets and count only those with \(a \leq b \leq c\).

---

**Implementation plan:**

- Enumerate all 9 prime assignment configurations.
- For each, derive \(a, b, c\).
- Count only those with \(a \leq b \leq c\).
- Count total such triples.

This reasoning suggests that, in total, there are only a few (up to 9) ordered triples.

Finally, the total number of such triples is 3, because by symmetry, for each position, assign the exponents, then order the resulting triples.

**Given the combinatorial symmetry, the total count of triples with \(a \leq b \leq c\) is exactly 3.**

The three triples (ordered) are:

1. \((1, 2^{2020}, 3^{2020})\) where \(a=1\), \(b=2^{2020}\), \(c=3^{2020}\),
2. \((2^{2020}, 1, 3^{2020})\) not ordered,
3. etc.

Only the triples with the exponents assigned so that \(a \leq b \leq c\) survive, which are:

- When the all-zeros assignments happen (which can't, because the exponents sum to 2020, and at least one prime assignment must be to each prime).

Alternatively, since only one prime is assigned to each position in each configuration, and the total sum for each prime is fixed at 2020, the count of triples with the ordering constraint is 3, corresponding to choosing the minimal prime exponents for \(a\), the median for \(b\), and the largest for \(c\).

### Implementation:

```python
# Enumerate all possible distributions of prime factors (2 and 3) among (a, b, c)
# with the constraint that each prime's total exponent (2020) is assigned entirely to exactly one variable
# (since gcd condition forces disjoint support per prime).
# For each assignment, derive (a, b, c), then count only those with a <= b <= c.
# Sum them up.

# prime exponents sum to 2020, assigned entirely to one variable per prime
assignments = []

# For prime 2: assign to a, b, or c
for prime2_position in range(3):
    # For prime 3: assign to a, b, or c
    for prime3_position in range(3):
        # For each position, assign the prime's entire exponents
        exponents = [1, 1, 1]  # placeholder for base, will multiply
        a_exp_2 = 2020 if prime2_position == 0 else 0
        b_exp_2 = 2020 if prime2_position == 1 else 0
        c_exp_2 = 2020 if prime2_position == 2 else 0

        a_exp_3 = 2020 if prime3_position == 0 else 0
        b_exp_3 = 2020 if prime3_position == 1 else 0
        c_exp_3 = 2020 if prime3_position == 2 else 0

        a_val = (2 ** a_exp_2) * (3 ** a_exp_3)
        b_val = (2 ** b_exp_2) * (3 ** b_exp_3)
        c_val = (2 ** c_exp_2) * (3 ** c_exp_3)

        # store the triples
        triples = [(a_val, b_val, c_val)]
        for trip in triples:
            a, b, c = trip
            if a <= b <= c:
                print(trip)
```
