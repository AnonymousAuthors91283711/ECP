The problem appears to involve finding a two-digit prime number \( n \) between 10 and 99, with the additional constraints that:
- both \( n \) itself and its components (the tens digit \( n/10 \) and units digit \( n \% 10 \)) are prime numbers,
- and you want to count how many such numbers satisfy these conditions.

Let's analyze the constraints:
- \( 10 \leq n \leq 99 \)
- \( n \) is prime
- The tens digit \( n // 10 \) is prime
- The units digit \( n \% 10 \) is prime

Since the tens digit and units digit are both digits (1-9), their prime candidates are 2, 3, 5, 7.

To satisfy the maximum conditions, for each allowed tens digit (2, 3, 5, 7), we consider all possible units digits (2, 3, 5, 7), forming candidate numbers. For each candidate, check whether \( n \) is prime. Count the total such numbers and output all candidates.

Here's the Python code to enumerate and count:

```python
# List of prime digits (possible tens and units digits)
prime_digits = [2, 3, 5, 7]

# Function to check primality
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    if num in (2, 3):
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(num**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Collect satisfying numbers
valid_numbers = []
for tens in prime_digits:
    for units in prime_digits:
        n = tens * 10 + units
        if is_prime(n):
            print(n)
            valid_numbers.append(n)

# Count how many
print(f"Total count: {len(valid_numbers)}")
```

This program enumerates all two-digit numbers with prime digits in both places, checks for primality, streams valid solutions immediately, and finally outputs the count.
