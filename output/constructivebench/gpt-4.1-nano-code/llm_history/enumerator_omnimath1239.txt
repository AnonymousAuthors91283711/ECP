The problem involves algebraic properties of polynomials over integers, specifically gcd and lcm of quadratic polynomials parameterized by integers a, b, c. To understand the relation and find the value of a + b + c, we explore candidates where the gcd and lcm match the given forms and derive the sum.

The approach:
- Use small integer values for a, b, c.
- Factor the quadratics in simplified situations.
- Check gcd and lcm conditions.
- Find the value of a + b + c when conditions hold.

Since gcd and lcm are involved, we focus on cases where the quadratics share factors or are coprime accordingly, attempting small integers systematically.

```python
# We examine small integer values for a, b, c to find the correct sum that matches the conditions.
# We seek gcd of two quadratics as X+1, and their lcm as specified.
# To do that efficiently, we simulate polynomial gcd and lcm over integers.

from sympy import symbols, Poly, gcd, lcm, factor

X = symbols('X')

# Function to create quadratic polynomial with parameters a, b
def quad(a, b):
    return Poly(X**2 + a*X + b, X)

# Candidate range of small integers
candidate_range = range(-10, 11)

for a in candidate_range:
    for b in candidate_range:
        for c in candidate_range:
            poly1 = poly = Poly(X**2 + a*X + b, X)
            poly2 = Poly(X**2 + b*X + c, X)
            # Compute gcd and lcm over polynomials
            current_gcd = gcd(poly1, poly2)
            # Compute product
            product = poly1 * poly2
            # Compute gcd
            current_gcd = gcd(poly1, poly2)
            # Derive lcm = product / gcd
            current_lcm = product.quo(current_gcd)
            # Check if gcd polynomial is X+1
            if current_gcd.as_expr().degree() == 1 and current_gcd.as_expr() == X + 1:
                if current_lcm.as_expr() == X**3 - 4*X**2 + X + 6:
                    answer_sum = a + b + c
                    print(answer_sum)
```

The problem requires enumerating small integer triplets to find parameters a, b, c such that the gcd and lcm of the specific quadratics match the given polynomials. The code intends to check all candidates in a small range but ends up producing no output, likely because it doesn't match the specific polynomial forms properly or the polynomial divisions are not handled precisely.

Key issues:
- The code uses `product.quo(current_gcd)` for lcm, which is correct, but the explicit comparison to the target polynomial might fail due to differences in polynomial expression forms (coefficients, factorization).
- The conditions check that `current_gcd` has degree 1 and equals `X+1`, which is good.
- The lcm is checked against `X^3 - 4X^2 + X + 6`, but since `gcd` and the quadratics are small, these polynomials are manageable.
- The program does not output anything because the conditions never match or there's an oversight.

Approach correction:
- To increase chance, explicitly verify the polynomial forms using `Poly.as_expr()`.
- Add debug prints or print whenever a match is found to identify if any candidates match.
- Also, ensure the polynomials are correctly created and matched.

Since the original code produces no output, it is rejected. Here's a cleaned and corrected version that:
- Properly compares polynomials.
- Prints candidate matches.
- Ensures the answer is found if it exists.

**Note**: Since the problem is to feed in a small range, and the check is simply that the gcd is `X+1` and the lcm is the given cubic polynomial, we will print out only the sum for matches.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Poly, gcd

X = symbols('X')

# Search range for parameters
candidate_range = range(-10, 11)

for a in candidate_range:
    for b in candidate_range:
        for c in candidate_range:
            poly1 = Poly(X**2 + a*X + b, X)
            poly2 = Poly(X**2 + b*X + c, X)
            current_gcd = gcd(poly1, poly2)
            product = poly1 * poly2
            current_lcm = product.quo(current_gcd)

            # Check if gcd polynomial is X+1
            if current_gcd.as_expr().expand() == X + 1:
                # Check if

The problem, as described, involves algebraic identities involving polynomials over â„¤ and their gcd/lcm, expressed in a formal theorem proof language (likely Lean). The core claim relates the gcd and lcm of two quadratic polynomials to a linear polynomial and a cubic polynomial, respectively, and asserts a condition on the parameters a, b, c.

The "program" provided is empty, with output indicating an error. Since the instructions specify the program should enumerate and print answers, but here it is missing, the code can do nothing, and the output signifies no solutions or invalid code.

**Assessment:**
- The problem's statement involves symbolic algebra identities about polynomials, which likely lead to a relation among a, b, c.
- As no code is provided, it cannot produce any results.
- The problem is a high-school competition-level math problem, asking perhaps to deduce the relation based on polynomial identities, and then implement enumeration or verification.
- Since the task is to make an executable Python program that enumerates answers, given only the formal theorem and the fact that the code is missing, the best approach is to attempt to write a small enumeration over plausible small integer values for a, b, c and check whether the polynomial identities hold.

**Approach to Correction:**
- Assume small ranges for a, b, c (say -10 to 10).
- For each triplet, compute the gcd and lcm of the given polynomials explicitly.
- Check whether the identities match:
  - gcd matches X + 1
  - lcm matches X^3 - 4X^2 + X + 6
- If so, print the sums or the triplet as needed to verify.

Since the original code is empty, the answer should be rejected. We will write a corrected enumeration program that checks small sample values, prints parameter sets that satisfy the identities, thereby effectively enumerating solutions.

---

**Conclusion:**
- The original program is rejected (empty, no output).
- The corrected code enumerates small candidate solutions, checking the identities by symbolic polynomial algebra, and outputs solutions immediately when found.
