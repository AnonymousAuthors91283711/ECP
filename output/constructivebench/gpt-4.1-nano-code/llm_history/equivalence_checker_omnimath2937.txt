Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 15
Let me analyze this problem carefully.

The problem presents an equation:
3 * 3 * 5 * 5 * 7 * 9 = 3 * 3 * 7 * omnimath2937_answer * omnimath2937_answer

We need to find the value of omnimath2937_answer that makes this equation true.

First, let's simplify both sides:
Left side: 3 * 3 * 5 * 5 * 7 * 9 = 9 * 25 * 7 * 9 = 14175
Right side: 3 * 3 * 7 * x * x = 9 * 7 * x² = 63x²

Setting them equal: 14175 = 63x²
Divide both sides by 63: 225 = x²
Take square root: x = 15 (since we're dealing with natural numbers)

The proposed answer is 15, which matches exactly with our calculation.

<<<True>>>
