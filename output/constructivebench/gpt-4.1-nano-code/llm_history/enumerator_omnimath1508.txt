This problem seems to involve summing a series involving Fibonacci numbers, specifically:
\[ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{\mathrm{fib}(n+1)}{4^{n+2}}. \]
Our goal is to find this sum, likely a rational number, through enumeration of finite partial sums. Let's attempt to enumerate partial sums up to some small N, see the result pattern, and then infer the exact sum.

The approach:
- Fix a small max N (such as N = 20) for computational tractability.
- Use the Fibonacci sequence for initial terms.
- Sum the series up to that N.
- For each partial sum, print the approximate value.
- When the partial sums stabilize or approximate a suspicious rational, we can conjecture the exact value.

The code will:
- Compute Fibonacci numbers iteratively.
- Sum the terms up to N.
- Print each partial sum.

Let's implement that now.

```python
# Python program to enumerate partial sums of the series involving Fibonacci numbers

def fib(n):
    # Generate Fibonacci numbers iteratively
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a

def enumerate_series(max_n=20):
    for N in range(1, max_n + 1):
        total = 0.0
        for n in range(N):
            fib_num = fib(n+1)
            term = fib_num / (4 ** (n+2))
            total += term
        print(f"Partial sum up to n={N}: {total:.10f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_series()
```
