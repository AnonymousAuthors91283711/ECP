This problem involves summing over pairs of subsets of ranges, with a focus on their sizes and intersections. To help conjecture an answer, we will enumerate small values of `n`, compute `S(n)`, and observe patterns in the results, especially for `n` up to 5 or 6. We will print all computed `S(n)` values, emphasizing exact results. This can illuminate relationships between `S(2022)` and `S(2021)` or their ratios.

Given the problem's context and considering the size of `n`, exact calculation for large `n` is infeasible. For small `n`, we can directly enumerate all subset pairs and compute whether their cardinalities match. We will also print the final ratio's simplified form to facilitate conjecturing.

```python
from itertools import chain, combinations
from math import gcd

# Generate all subsets of a set of size n
def subsets(n):
    return list(chain.from_iterable(combinations(range(n), r) for r in range(n+1)))

# Compute S(n) based on the problem's formula
def S(n):
    all_subsets = subsets(n)
    total = 0
    for A in all_subsets:
        A_set = set(A)
        for B in all_subsets:
            B_set = set(B)
            if len(A) == len(B):
                total += len(A_set.intersection(B_set))
    return total

max_n = 6
results = {}
for n in range(max_n + 1):
    val = S(n)
    print(f"S({n}) = {val}")
    results[n] = val

# Display ratios for small values to observe patterns
for n in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    p = results[n]
    q = results[n-1]
    d = gcd(p, q)
    p_div, q_div = p // d, q // d
    ratio = f"{p_div}/{q_div}"
    print(f"Ratio S({n}) / S({n-1}) = {ratio}")
```
