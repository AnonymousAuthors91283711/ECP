The problem involves the set of residues of n^100 mod 125 as n varies over ℤ. Since 125 = 5^3, the possible residues are determined by n mod 125. The key is to understand the pattern for n^100 mod 125. Noticing that for n coprime with 125, Euler's theorem gives n^{100} ≡ 1 mod 125. For n divisible by 5, higher powers of 5 influence whether n^100 is 0 mod 125 or other residues. After analysis, the residues are precisely 0, 1, 25, 125, and 100 modulo 125, with the set of residues having 4 elements. 

The set size is 4: {0, 1, 25, 100}.

\(\boxed{\text{Answer} := 4}\)
