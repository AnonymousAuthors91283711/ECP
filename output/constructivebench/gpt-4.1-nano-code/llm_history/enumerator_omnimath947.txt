This problem appears to involve a nested function qmark, of which the exact definition is not provided, but which seemingly operates on real numbers and parameters, with properties connecting to tangent and π/12. Our goal is to implement a Python enumeration to explore possible values of N and related parameters, aiming to analyze the condition qmark(qmark(N, hN), hNq) = tan(π/12) and to infer the value of N that satisfies this.

Assuming qmark is a function which, given certain parameters, produces specific real values in a manageable domain, we can approximate this by testing small rational or decimal values for N and related variables, examining the output of qmark under various inputs. Since the actual implementation of qmark is unknown, we'll mock it as a placeholder and focus on enumerating candidate values of N.

We will:
- Use small sample values for N (e.g., from -2 to 2).
- For each candidate N, compute hN and hNq as mock parameters (or fix them to simple values, e.g., hN=1, hNq=1).
- Compute qmark iteratively with these parameters.
- Check whether the nested qmark equals tan(π/12). We approximate tan(π/12) ≈ 0.2679.
- Print each N that satisfies the condition, streaming partial results.

Here's the Python code focusing on enumeration:

```python
import math

# Mock qmark function: placeholder, as actual definition is unknown
def qmark(x, y):
    # For demonstration, assume qmark behaves linearly
    return 0.5 * x + 0.3 * y

# Target value: tan(pi/12) ≈ tan(15 degrees)
target = math.tan(math.pi / 12)

# Enumerate over a small set of candidate N values
for N in [i * 0.1 for i in range(-20, 21)]:  # N from -2 to 2 in steps of 0.1
    hN = 1  # fixed for simplicity
    hNq = 1  # fixed
    inner_value = qmark(N, hN)
    outer_value = qmark(inner_value, hNq)
    print(f"N={N:.2f}, qmark(qmark(N,hN),hNq)={outer_value:.4f}")
    if abs(outer_value - target) < 1e-3:
        print(f"Possible solution: N={N:.2f} yields qmark(qmark(N,hN),hNq)≈tan(pi/12)")
```
