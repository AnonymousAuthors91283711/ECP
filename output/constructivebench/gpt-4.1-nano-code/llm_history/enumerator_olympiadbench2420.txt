This problem involves a quadratic function with parameters \(a, h, k\) satisfying a functional equation for all \(x\). The key is to analyze the polynomial identity:

\[a(x - 2)(x + 4) = 2(x - h)^2 + k\]

1. Expand both sides:
    - Left: \(a(x^2 + 2x - 8)\)
    - Right: \(2(x^2 - 2h x + h^2) + k = 2x^2 - 4h x + 2h^2 + k\)

2. Equate coefficients:
    - \(a x^2 + 2 a x - 8 a = 2 x^2 - 4 h x + 2 h^2 + k\)

Matching coefficients:

- For \(x^2\):
  \(\boxed{a = 2}\)

- For \(x\):
  \(2 a = -4 h \Rightarrow 2 \times 2 = -4 h \Rightarrow 4 = -4h \Rightarrow h = -1\)

- Constant terms:
  \(-8 a = 2 h^2 + k \Rightarrow -8 \times 2 = 2 \times 1 + k \Rightarrow -16 = 2 + k \Rightarrow k = -18\)

The unique solution should be \((a, h, k) = (2, -1, -18)\).

Now, to assist in conjecture, we will write a program that searches for other triplets satisfying the polynomial identity, although the algebra suggests this may be the only solution. We will test small ranges around the deduced values.

```python
# Enumerate small integer candidates for a, h, k around the algebraic solution
# We use small ranges based on the algebraic derivation
for a in [2]:
    for h in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
        for k in [-20, -18, -16]:
            # Define left and right of the polynomial identity
            def lhs(x):
                return a * (x - 2) * (x + 4)
            def rhs(x):
                return 2 * (x - h) ** 2 + k
            # Check the equality for some sample points
            points = [-10, -5, 0, 5, 10]
            if all(lhs(x) == rhs(x) for x in points):
                print((a, h, k))
```
