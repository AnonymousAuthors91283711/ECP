This problem involves an unknown function `omnimath3405_answer` that takes an integer `x` and produces an integer, with the theorem stating that if `3x + 1` is even, then `omnimath3405_answer x` is odd. The goal is to discover possible values of the answer, especially if there's a pattern or a simple formula.

Given the symmetry and common patterns in such problems, we'll:
- Explore small integers `x` to test when `3x + 1` is even.
- For those `x`, observe the value of the output in an attempt to find a pattern that guarantees oddness.
- Enumerate potential answers for a small set of `x` values.

Since the problem doesn't specify the function's behavior or any additional constraints, we'll:
- Consider `x` in a small range, say from -10 to 10.
- For each `x` where `3x+1` is even, output `omnimath3405_answer x` as all candidates, assuming the function might produce any integer satisfying the oddness condition.

Here's the code that:
- Checks the parity condition.
- Prints all candidate outputs for those `x`.
- These candidates will be hypothetical, reflecting potential solutions consistent with the theorem.

```python
# Enumerate x in range to find where 3x + 1 is even
for x in range(-10, 11):
    if (3 * x + 1) % 2 == 0:
        # For demonstration, hypothesize answer is any odd integer.
        # We'll list a small set of odd integers as candidates.
        for candidate in [-5, -3, -1, 1, 3, 5]:
            # Only output candidates confirming the oddness condition
            if candidate % 2 != 0:
                print(f"X={x}, Candidate answer={candidate}")
```
