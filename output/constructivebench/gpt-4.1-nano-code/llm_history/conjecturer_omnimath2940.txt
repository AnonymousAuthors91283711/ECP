Count: 7. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern of the enumerated answers, these are perfect squares, mostly of primes squared, less than 1000. The key elements involve numbers of the form p^2 * q^2 with p and q primes, p ≠ q, p, q primes, and the product less than 1000. The number 36 appears to correspond to the count of such pairs. Considering the enumeration and the pattern, the total count of such n is 36.

Therefore, the answer is simply 36.
