The problem appears to be a theorem about natural numbers, involving modular arithmetic: given that 100 % x = 10, what is 1000 % x? We know that 100 ≡ 10 (mod x), so 100 = kx + 10 for some integer k. Then, 1000 = 10 * 100 = 10(kx + 10) = 10kx + 100. 

Since 100 ≡ 10 (mod x), and 1000 = 10 * 100, we have 1000 ≡ 10 * 10 ≡ 100 (mod x), but 100 ≡ 10 (mod x), so 1000 ≡ 10 (mod x). So, the answer is likely x itself, or related to divisors, but to explore all possibilities and find the set of possible values, I will enumerate divisor and multiples relations.

Here's a program that enumerates small possible x satisfying the conditions, then computes 1000 % x for each. I'll print out each result as found, focusing on small x ≥ 1, with the condition 100 % x = 10, which implies x > 10 and x divides 100 - 10 = 90.

```python
# Enumerate x > 10 such that 100 % x = 10
# Since 100 % x = 10, x must be > 10 and x divides (100 - 10) = 90
# x divides 90, and is > 10
for x in range(11, 91):
    if 90 % x == 0:
        remainder = 1000 % x
        print(f"x = {x}, 1000 % x = {remainder}")
```
