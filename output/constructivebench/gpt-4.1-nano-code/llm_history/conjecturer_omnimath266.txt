The pattern suggests the number of real roots is constrained by the degree of the polynomial. Since the polynomial degree is 2006, and the roots' absolute values are limited to 1006, the maximum number of real roots (where imaginary part is zero) cannot exceed the degree. Typically, for polynomials over complex numbers, the maximum number of real roots equals the degree. The least such k satisfying the properties is therefore 0, when no real roots are required or exist.
