The pattern suggests the function must satisfy the multiplicative property relating `f x`, `f y`, and `f (x * y)` under GCD conditions. The constant function `λ _ => 1` satisfies the property universally, since multiplication by 1 keeps the equality intact. No other simple functions fit all cases (e.g., constant 1). Thus, the only such function is the constant-1 function.
