This problem involves evaluating the sum of absolute values of certain logarithms, given specific conditions on the logarithms of \(x, y, z\). The main challenge is understanding the relationships and the values they imply.

Given:
- \(\log_{5} x = 100\)
- \(\log_{5} y = -60\)
- \(\log_{5} z = 20\)

We need to compute:
\[ | \log_{5} x | + | \log_{5} y | + | \log_{5} z | \]

The exact values are directly given by these logs:
- \(\log_{5} x = 100 \Rightarrow |100| = 100\)
- \(\log_{5} y = -60 \Rightarrow |-60| = 60\)
- \(\log_{5} z = 20 \Rightarrow |20| = 20\)

Sum: \(100 + 60 + 20 = 180\)

```python
# Given logs are fixed as per the problem:
log_x = 100
log_y = -60
log_z = 20

# Sum of absolute values:
answer = abs(log_x) + abs(log_y) + abs(log_z)
print(answer)  # Expected output: 180
```
