. Enumerated answers: a=b=c=1, A=3.0
a=b=1+0.001, c=1-0.0005, A≈3.000001498502248. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The minimum occurs at a = b = c = 1, making A = 3.0. Slight deviations increase A due to the convexity properties of the cubic function and the sum restrictions. Thus, the minimum value is 3.0.
