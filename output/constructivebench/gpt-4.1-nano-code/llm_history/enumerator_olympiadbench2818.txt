The problem involves counting the number of integer pairs (p₁, p₂) within the square [-20, 20] × [-20, 20], such that each pair corresponds to a quadratic polynomial with a complex root x satisfying two quadratic equations. The equations are:

1) \( x^2 + p_1 x + p_2 = 0 \)
2) \( x^2 + p_2 x + p_1 = 0 \)

Since the same root x satisfies both, subtracting the two equations yields:

\[
(p_1 - p_2) x + (p_2 - p_1) = 0 \implies (p_1 - p_2)(x - 1) = 0
\]

This gives two cases:

**Case 1:** \( p_1 = p_2 \)

- Both quadratic equations are identical: \( x^2 + p_1 x + p_1 = 0 \).
- The quadratic discriminant: \( p_1^2 - 4 p_1 = p_1(p_1 - 4) \).
- Roots are real if discriminant ≥ 0:

\[
p_1(p_1 - 4) \ge 0
\]
which implies either:
- \( p_1 \ge 4 \), or
- \( p_1 \le 0 \)

- For \( p_1 \) in [-20, 20], the integers satisfying this:

\[
p_1 \le 0 \quad \text{or} \quad p_1 \ge 4
\]

- For each such \( p_1 \), roots are:

\[
x = \frac{-p_1 \pm \sqrt{p_1(p_1 - 4)}}{2}
\]

which are real iff discriminant ≥ 0. Since roots are real both roots are real if discriminant ≥ 0. For roots to exist (roots real), discriminant ≥ 0, and the roots are real; for complex roots, discriminant < 0, i.e., no real roots.

The problem asks for solutions with complex roots, so roots are complex if discriminant < 0, i.e., in the cases:

- \( p_1 \in (-20, 4) \) (here \( p_1 \) taking integer values from -20 up to 3). For these, quadratic has no real roots, so roots are complex.

Check whether roots satisfy the original equations: For all \( p_1 \in [-20, 3] \), the quadratic \( x^2 + p_1 x + p_1 = 0 \) has complex roots, as discriminant < 0.

Similarly, for such \( p_1 \), \( p_2 = p_1 \), so:

\[
p_2 = p_1 \in [-20, 3]
\]

Number of such (p₁,p₂):

| p₁ | p₂ = p₁ | count per p₁ | total count = number of p₁'s in [-20, 3] = 24 |

Case 2: \( p_1 \neq p_2 \)

- Then \( x = 1 \). Plug into the equations:

\[
1^2 + p_1 \cdot 1 + p_2 = 0 \Rightarrow 1 + p_1 + p_2 = 0 \Rightarrow p_2 = -p_1 - 1
\]
\[
1^2 + p_2 \cdot 1 + p_1 = 0 \Rightarrow 1 + p_2 + p_1 = 0 \Rightarrow p_2 = - p_1 - 1
\]

Consistent with the above, for \( p_1 \neq p_2 \), the pair must satisfy \( p_2 = - p_1 - 1 \), with \( p_1 \neq p_2 \):

\[
p_1 \neq - p_1 - 1 \Rightarrow 2 p_1 \neq -1 \Rightarrow p_1 \neq -\frac{1}{2}
\]

But \( p_1 \in ℤ \), so \( p_1 \neq -0.5 \) always holds.

Check whether such pairs with \( p_2 = - p_1 - 1 \) satisfy the bounds:

\[
p_2 = - p_1 - 1 \in [-20, 20]
\]
and \( p_1 \in [-20, 20] \).

For \( p_1 \in [-20,20] \), \( p_2 \in [-20, 20] \) iff \( p_1 \in [-20, 20] \).

Lastly, check the roots:

- The root \( x \) is at 1 (from the earlier deduction in the derivation). Roots are complex if discriminant of the quadratic is negative, i.e.,

\[
p_1(p_1 - 4) < 0
\]

which holds when:

\[
p_1 \in (0, 4) \Rightarrow p_1 = 1, 2, 3
\]

since \( p_1 \) is integer, only these satisfy.

For these values:

- \( p_2 = - p_1 - 1 \):

| p₁ | p₂ | discriminant \( p_1(p_1 - 4) \) | negative? | roots are complex? |
|-----|-----|------------------------------|-----------|------------------|
| 1   | -2  | 1(1-4)= -3 < 0             | yes       | complex roots     |
| 2   | -3  | 2(2-4)= -4<0               | yes       | complex roots     |
| 3   | -4  | 3(3-4)= -3<0               | yes       | complex roots     |

Correspondence:

Number of pairs:

- For each p₁ ∈ {1, 2, 3}, p₂ = - p₁ - 1 and within bounds (-20 to 20): yes.

Number of such pairs: 3.

---

### Final enumeration:

- From case 1: all \( p_1 \in [-20, 3] \), with \( p_2 = p_1 \). All these have \( p_1(p_1 - 4) < 0 \), roots are complex, count: 24.

- From case 2: three pairs with \( p_1 \in \{1, 2, 3\} \), \( p_2 = - p_1 - 1 \), roots are complex.

Total solutions (answers) matching the equations with complex roots are 24 + 3 = 27.

Below is the Python code enumerating these pairs.

```python
# Enumerate all pairs (p1, p2) within [-20, 20] satisfying the conditions
results = []

# Case 1: p1 = p2 in [-20, 3], roots are complex
for p1 in range(-20, 4):
    p2 = p1
    # Discriminant < 0 for complex roots in case 1
    discriminant = p1 * (p1 - 4)
    if discriminant < 0:
        results.append((p1, p2))
        print((p1, p2))

# Case 2: p2 = -p1 - 1, with roots complex when p1 in {1,2,3}
for p1 in [1, 2, 3]:
    p2 = -p1 -1
    # Roots are complex if discriminant < 0
    discriminant = p1 * (p1 - 4)
    if discriminant < 0:
        results.append((p1, p2))
        print((p1, p2))
```
