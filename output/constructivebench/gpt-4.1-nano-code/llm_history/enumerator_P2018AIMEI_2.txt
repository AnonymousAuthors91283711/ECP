The problem involves identifying specific integers \(a, b, c\) that satisfy three equations with constraints on their values. The key equations relate to certain polynomial expressions and digit manipulations in different bases, which suggests a search over small integer ranges.

Given the constraints:
- \(1 \leq a \leq 5\)
- \(b \leq 13\)
- \(c \leq 13\)

We will enumerate all possible \((a, b, c)\) tuples within these bounds, check the equations, and print solutions as soon as they satisfy all conditions. This approach will help explicitly find the value of \(P_{2018AIMEI_2\_answer}\) as a candidate.

```python
# Brute-force enumeration over small ranges for a, b, c
# Check the three equations for each triplet:
# 1) a*14^2 + b*14 + c
# 2) a*15^2 + c*15 + b
# 3) a*6^3 + c*6^2 + a*6 + c

for a in range(1, 6):
    for b in range(14):  # b ≤ 13, so 0..13
        for c in range(14):  # c ≤ 13, so 0..13
            eq1 = a * 14**2 + b * 14 + c
            eq2 = a * 15**2 + c * 15 + b
            eq3 = a * 6**3 + c * 6**2 + a * 6 + c

            # Check if all three are equal
            if eq1 == eq2 == eq3:
                print(f"Solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
                print(f"Value: {eq1}")
```
