theorem olympiadbench2715 : 
  ∃ (s : Finset ℝ), (∀ x ∈ s, ⌊x / 2⌋ - ⌊x / 3⌋ = x / 7) ∧ 
  (∀ x ∉ s, ¬(⌊x / 2⌋ - ⌊x / 3⌋ = x / 7)) ∧ 
  s.sum id = olympiadbench2715_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solution x = 0.00000
Solution x = 7.00000
Solution x = 21.00000
Sum of solutions in interval: 28.00000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The solutions satisfy the equation ⌊x/2⌋ - ⌊x/3⌋ = x/7. Analyzing the pattern, integer solutions 0, 7, and 21 satisfy the equation, with sum 28. The pattern suggests these are the only solutions in reals, with explicit values being 0, 7, and 21.
