This is a combinatorial number problem involving digit sums. The task is to find the count of natural numbers n with n > 0, satisfying:

n + sum of the digits of n + sum of the digits of the sum of digits of n = 2007.

We need to enumerate candidate n values to estimate the count. Since the largest digit sum for a number is for a 4- or 5-digit number (~45 for 99999), starting with small n and checking the equation is practical.

We'll:
- Iterate over n in a reasonable range (say 1 to 3000).
- Compute the digit sums.
- Check if the sum matches the target.
- Count and print each matching n.

This will help us approximate or find the exact count.

```python
def digit_sum(x):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(x))

target = 2007
count = 0
for n in range(1, 3001):  # Small sample range
    s1 = digit_sum(n)
    s2 = digit_sum(s1)
    total = n + s1 + s2
    if total == target:
        print(n)
        count += 1

# Print the total count found
print("Count:", count)
```
