Ground Truth Answer: 3/32
Proposed Answer: (1/8)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

The problem is asking for the smallest rational number c such that for any finite simple graph G, the number of triangles (3-cliques) cubed is at most c times the number of edges (2-cliques) to the fourth power.

The ground truth answer is 3/32 ≈ 0.09375, which is a known result in extremal graph theory related to Mantel's theorem and the Kruskal-Katona theorem.

The proposed answer is 1/8 = 0.125, which is larger than 3/32. While this value of c would satisfy the inequality (since 3/32 is the least such c), it's not the minimal/optimal value.

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
