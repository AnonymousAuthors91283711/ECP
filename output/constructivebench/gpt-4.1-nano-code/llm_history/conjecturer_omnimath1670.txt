The polynomial \(f(x) = x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d\) has all roots less than 0, so roots are negative. Symmetric sums relate roots to coefficients, especially \(a = - (r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4)\), with roots all negative implying \(a > 0\). Given the sum condition \(a + b + c + d = 2009\), to maximize \(d\), minimize \(a, b, c\). The minimal sum of roots is 4 times the smallest root, approaching \(-\infty\). For maximum \(d\), when roots tend to \(-\infty\), \(d\) approaches infinity. To satisfy all conditions with \(r_i\) negative, the minimal feasible \(d\) occurs when roots tend to \(-\infty\), thus \(d\) approaches unboundedly large positive values. 

Answer: 
<<<2009>>>
