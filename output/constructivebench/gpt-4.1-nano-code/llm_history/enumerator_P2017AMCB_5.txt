The problem involves calculating the number of data points in the list `data` that are considered outliers based on the interquartile range (IQR) method. Specifically, we are to compute the count of data points either less than the lower bound or greater than the upper bound, where these bounds are computed using the given IQR and quartiles.

Given the dataset `data`, the quartiles `Q1` and `Q3`, and the IQR, the bounds are:
- Lower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
- Upper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

We will write a Python script that:
- Calculates these bounds
- Counts how many data points are outside these bounds
- Prints each outlier as it is identified to allow streaming of results

Since the problem asks to enumerate and confirm the answer without hardcoding, we will compute dynamically and print each outlier for clarity.

Here's the implementation:

```python
# Data and quartiles
data = [6, 19, 33, 33, 39, 41, 41, 43, 51, 57]
Q1 = 33
Q3 = 43
IQR = Q3 - Q1

# Calculate bounds
lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

# Initialize outlier count
outliers_count = 0

# Iterate over data to find outliers
for x in data:
    if x < lower_bound or x > upper_bound:
        print(x)
        outliers_count += 1

# Output the total count of outliers
print("Number of outliers:", outliers_count)
```
