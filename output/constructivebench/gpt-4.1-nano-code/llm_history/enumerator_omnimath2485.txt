The given problem involves solving a system of linear equations with four variables `(w, x, y, z)`. The constraints are:
- Sum: `w + x + y + z = 5`
- A geometric progression with coefficients: `2w + 4x + 8y + 16z = 7`
- Polynomial-like sums: `3w + 9x + 27y + 81z = 11` and `4w + 16x + 64y + 256z = 1`
- The last equation involves a scaled sum: `5w + 25x + 125y + 625z = ?`

To find the unique solution, we can interpret the system as a matrix equation and solve it systematically. We'll implement a Python code that:
- Defines the matrix of coefficients
- Defines the right-hand side vector
- Uses `numpy.linalg.solve` to find the solution
- Checks for a unique solution
- Prints the answer directly

This approach efficiently handles the linear algebra and streams the exact solution.

```python
import numpy as np

# Coefficient matrix
A = np.array([
    [1, 1, 1, 1],          # sum
    [2, 4, 8, 16],         # second equation
    [3, 9, 27, 81],        # third
    [4, 16, 64, 256],      # fourth
])

# Right-hand side vector
b = np.array([5, 7, 11, 1])

# Solve the linear system
try:
    solution = np.linalg.solve(A, b)
    w, x, y, z = solution
    # Compute the unknown answer for the last equation
    # The pattern suggests the last sum is 5w + 25x + 125y + 625z
    answer = 5*w + 25*x + 125*y + 625*z
    print("w =", w)
    print("x =", x)
    print("y =", y)
    print("z =", z)
    print("Answer to the last sum:", answer)
except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
    print("The system has no unique solution.")
```
