This problem involves finding functions \(f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying the functional equation:

\[
f(x)f(y) - f(x-1) - f(y+1) = f(x y) + 2x - 2y - 4,
\]

for all real \(x, y\). Since there's no straightforward algebraic solution prescribed, an effective approach for exploring solutions is to hypothesize specific simple forms (like affine functions) and verify them. Then, examine candidate solutions numerically.

Below, the program tests standard functions like constant, linear, and quadratic functions and checks whether they satisfy the functional equation for a sampled set of points. It outputs any candidate solutions immediately when found, aiding in conjectures about the form of solutions.

```python
import math

def check_function(f, test_points):
    for x in test_points:
        for y in test_points:
            # Calculate left and right sides
            lhs = f(x)*f(y) - f(x-1) - f(y+1)
            rhs = f(x*y) + 2*x - 2*y - 4
            # Check equality within a tolerance
            if not math.isclose(lhs, rhs, rel_tol=1e-9, abs_tol=1e-9):
                return False
    return True

# Define candidate functions
def constant_func(c):
    return lambda x: c

def linear_func(m, b):
    return lambda x: m*x + b

def quadratic_func(a, b, c):
    return lambda x: a*x**2 + b*x + c

test_points = [-1, 0, 1, 2]

# Check constant solutions: f(x) = c
for c in [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]:
    f = constant_func(c)
    if check_function(f, test_points):
        print(f"Constant solution: f(x) = {c}")

# Check linear solutions: f(x) = m*x + b
for m in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    for b in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
        f = linear_func(m, b)
        if check_function(f, test_points):
            print(f"Linear solution: f(x) = {m}*x + {b}")

# Check quadratic solutions: f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c
for a in [-1, 0, 1]:
    for b in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
        for c in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
            f = quadratic_func(a, b, c)
            if check_function(f, test_points):
                print(f"Quadratic solution: f(x) = {a}*x^2 + {b}*x + {c}")

# This exploration should aid in elucidating possible solutions.
