This problem appears to involve finding the maximum possible value of `k` such that there exists a vertex set `V` of size `n` with certain connectivity properties, specifically related to the existence of chains and degrees (nodes with degree ≥ 3). To help verify and conjecture the maximum value of `k` for small `n`, we can implement a brute-force enumeration of possible configurations.

Given the constraints and the complexity of the problem, a practical approach is to:
- Enumerate all subsets `V` of size up to `n`.
- For each subset, enumerate possible edge sets `E`.
- Check the conditions: existence of certain paths, degree thresholds, etc.
- Keep track of the maximum `k` found that satisfies the condition.

Since the problem asks for an `omnimath2355_answer n` function—a maximum `k`—we focus on generating candidate `k` values, starting from `n` descending or ascending, and verifying the conditions to find the maximum `k`.

Here's an efficient enumeration tailored for small `n` (e.g., `n ≤ 6`). We perform a search over `k`, then verify conditions for graphs with that `k`, printing solutions as we find them.

```python
import itertools

def omnimath2355_answer(n):
    # Max degree threshold to test
    max_possible_k = 0
    # For small n, test k down from n
    for k in range(n, 0, -1):
        found = False
        # Generate all subsets V of size n
        for V in itertools.combinations(range(1, n+1), n):
            V_set = set(V)
            # Generate all possible edge sets E
            # To limit complexity, consider graphs with degrees potentially ≥ 3
            possible_edges = list(itertools.combinations(itertools.product(V, repeat=2), r=0))
            # Since edge set could be large, limit to small number of edges
            for edge_count in range(n-1, n*(n-1)//2 +1):
                for E in itertools.combinations(possible_edges, edge_count):
                    E_set = set(E)
                    # Check degree conditions
                    degree = {v:0 for v in V}
