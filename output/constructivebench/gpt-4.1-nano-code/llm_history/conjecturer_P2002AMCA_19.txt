x=10. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern indicates f(x) alternates values 6, 2, 4, 2, 6 over five intervals. The set {x | f(f x) = 6} includes x mapped to 6 through two applications, so on the outer segments where f(x) = 6, x satisfies f x = 6, i.e., this occurs when x outside [a, d] union points where f x = 6 directly. Counting these points yields 12 (as per enumerated examples).  

Final answer: <<<12>>>
