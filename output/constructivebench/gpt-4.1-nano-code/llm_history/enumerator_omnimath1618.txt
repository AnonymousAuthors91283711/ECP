This problem asks us to find the minimal sum \( s = a + b + c + d \) such that there exist four distinct perfect squares \( a, b, c, d \), satisfying \( a^{b} = c^{d} \). We need to enumerate candidate solutions for \( a, b, c, d \) with small values, check the conditions, and find the minimal sum where such a quadruple exists.

Since the main challenge is to find the smallest sum \( s \) meeting the criteria, we will:
- Generate small perfect squares for \( a, b, c, d \), respecting the distinctness condition.
- For each quadruple, check if \( a^{b} = c^{d} \).
- Record and print each valid quadruple immediately and update the minimal sum.

To ensure efficiency:
- Limit the search to small squares (say, up to 100), since larger values quickly become infeasible.
- Check all combinations systematically.

Below is the Python program implementing this approach within the constraints.

```python
# Enumerate small perfect squares and check for equality of the exponential expressions for distinct quadruples.
# We print each candidate solution immediately and keep track of the minimal sum.

import math

def is_square(n):
    root = int(math.isqrt(n))
    return root * root == n

def generate_squares(limit):
    return [i * i for i in range(1, limit + 1)]

def main():
    squares = generate_squares(30)  # generate squares up to 900
    min_sum = None
    solutions = []

    for a in squares:
        for b in squares:
            for c in squares:
                for d in squares:
                    # Check for distinctness
                    if len({a, b, c, d}) != 4:
                        continue
                    # Check if a^b = c^d
                    # To avoid large calculations, compare using logarithms
                    # Handle zero exponents (though here, minimal exponent is 1)
                    # Use math.log for comparison
                    try:
                        val1 = b * math.log(a)
                        val2 = d * math.log(c)
                        if abs(val1 - val2) < 1e-9:
                            s = a + b + c + d
                            print(f"Found: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, sum={s}")
                            if min_sum is None or s < min_sum:
                                min_sum = s
                            solutions.append((a, b, c, d, s))
                    except:
                        # Skip invalid logs (e.g., log(0))
                        continue
    if min_sum is not None:
        print(f"Minimal sum: {min_sum}")
        # Find one solution with minimal sum
        for sol in solutions:
            if sol[4] == min_sum:
                print(f"Answer: {sol}")
                break
    else:
