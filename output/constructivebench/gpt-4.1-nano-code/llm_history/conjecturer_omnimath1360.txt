. Enumerated answers: {0.25, 0.5}. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The pattern suggests the solution set contains rational values derived from quadratic relationships. Since the equation is quadratic in a and d, and the answers include 0.25 and 0.5, the answer set likely consists of these rational numbers. Both are ratios of integers appearing from solving the quadratic. 

Thus, the set of all possible r values is {1/4, 1/2}.
