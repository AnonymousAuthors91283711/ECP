abbrev omnimath3328_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3328 : 
  {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ φ n = 2002^2 - 1} = omnimath3328_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: ∅
Proposed Answer: {2002 * 2003}
Let's analyze this problem carefully:

1. The problem asks for natural numbers n > 0 where Euler's totient function φ(n) equals 2002² - 1.

2. The ground truth answer is the empty set ∅, meaning there are no natural numbers n where φ(n) = 2002² - 1.

3. The proposed answer suggests that {2002 * 2003} is a solution.

Let's evaluate the proposed answer:
- φ(2002 * 2003) = φ(2002) * φ(2003) since 2002 and 2003 are coprime (2003 is prime)
- φ(2002) = φ(2*7*11*13) = 1*6*10*12 = 720
- φ(2003) = 2002 (since 2003 is prime)
- So φ(2002 * 2003) = 720 * 2002 = 1,441,440
- But 2002² - 1 = 4,008,004 - 1 = 4,008,003

Clearly 1,441,440 ≠ 4,008,003, so the proposed answer is incorrect. The ground truth answer of ∅ appears to be correct since we've shown the proposed solution doesn't work and no other obvious candidates come to mind.
