open Nat Set

abbrev mathodyssey29_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem mathodyssey29 :
  {(a, b) : ℤ × ℤ | a ≠ 0 ∧ b ≠ 0 ∧ (a ^ 3 + b) * (a + b ^ 3) = (a + b) ^ 4}.ncard = mathodyssey29_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solution: a=-5, b=-3
Solution: a=-3, b=-5
Solution: a=-1, b=1
Solution: a=1, b=-1
Solution: a=3, b=5
Solution: a=5, b=3
Total solutions: 6. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The solutions are symmetric with respect to swapping and sign changes, and include \(\pm 1\) and \(\pm 3\). The total count is 6, with these pairs: \((-5,-3), (-3,-5), (-1,1), (1,-1), (3,5), (5,3)\). The pattern suggests total solutions are always 6, independent of other parameters.

Thus, the answer is a constant ℕ: 6.

<<<6>>>
