theorem omnimath3004 : 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = omnimath3004_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 10^2
Proposed Answer: (4 * (4 + 1) / 2)^2
Let's analyze both answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer: 10^2 = 100
2. Proposed Answer: (4*(4+1)/2)^2 = (4*5/2)^2 = (20/2)^2 = 10^2 = 100

The proposed answer is using the formula for the sum of cubes of first n natural numbers, which is (n(n+1)/2)^2. For n=4, this gives exactly the same result as the ground truth answer.

Both answers evaluate to 100, and the proposed answer correctly uses a general formula that would work for any n, not just for n=4.
