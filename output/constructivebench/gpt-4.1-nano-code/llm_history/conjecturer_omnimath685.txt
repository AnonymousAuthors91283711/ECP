open List

abbrev omnimath685_answer : Set (List Bool) := sorry
theorem omnimath685 (s : List Bool) : 
  s ∈ omnimath685_answer ↔ 
  s.length = 8 ∧ ∀ t ∈ omnimath685_answer, s ≠ t → 3 ≤ List.length (List.filter (fun (p : Bool × Bool) => p.fst ≠ p.snd) (List.zip s t)) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: Set (List Bool)
The pattern implies that the answer set includes all length-8 bitlists where, for any distinct element t, the filtered zipped list between s and t always contains at least 3 mismatched pairs. This condition is symmetric and generalizes to all such lists with length 8.
