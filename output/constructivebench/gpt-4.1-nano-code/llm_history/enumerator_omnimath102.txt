Certainly! Your problem involves finding the least real number \( a \) such that for any real numbers \( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 \), there exist integer shifts \( k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4 \) making the sum of pairwise squared differences of the shifted values at most \( a \).

This resembles a problem of minimal possible total squared differences after shifting by integers, similar to a least total variance or least sum of differences in a lattice shift scenario.

To approximate this minimal value, systematically enumerate small integer shifts around the given real points, compute the sum of squared differences, and find the minimal value across these.

Here's a Python script that:
- Sets some representative points \( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 \).
- Enumerates over small integer shifts (\(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\)) for each \( k_i \).
- Calculates the sum of squared differences.
- Tracks and streams minimal sums.

This way, you can conjecture the minimal total, approximate the least to high precision, and potentially prove the true minimal.

```python
import itertools

# Representative points to analyze; can be any real values
a_points = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

# Small integer shifts to consider
shift_range = range(-2, 3)

min_sum = float('inf')

# Enumerate all combinations of shifts
for k_tuple in itertools.product(shift_range, repeat=4):
    a1_k, a2_k, a3_k, a4_k = k_tuple
    # Shifted points
    A1, A2, A3, A4 = (a_points[i] - k_tuple[i] for i in range(4))
    # Compute pairwise squared differences
    differences = [
        (A1 - A2)**2,
        (A1 - A3)**2,
        (A1 - A4)**2,
        (A2 - A3)**2,
        (A2 - A4)**2,
        (A3 - A4)**2
    ]
    total = sum(differences)
    print(f"Shifts: {k_tuple} -> Sum of squared differences: {total}")
    if total < min_sum:
        min_sum = total

print(f"Approximate minimal sum: {min_sum}")
```

This code gives a lower bound estimate for the minimal \( a \) and streams all candidate sums over small integers. It can be adjusted with more points or larger shift ranges for refinement.
