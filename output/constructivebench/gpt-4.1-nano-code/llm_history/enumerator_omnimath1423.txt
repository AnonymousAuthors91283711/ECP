This problem appears to involve summing over \(k\) from 1 to 2009, where the summand is \(k \times (\lfloor 2009 / k \rfloor - \lfloor 2008 / k \rfloor)\). Observing the structure, note that:

- \(\lfloor 2009 / k \rfloor - \lfloor 2008 / k \rfloor\) is 1 exactly when \(k\) divides 2009 but not 2008, i.e., when 2008 / k and 2009 / k differ by exactly 1, which happens when 2009 mod k ≈ 0 but 2008 mod k ≠ 0.

- Since 2008 and 2009 are close, their divisors are small or specific.

To enumerate potential answers efficiently, we note the term will be non-zero only when \(k\) divides 2009, with the value \(k\) when it divides 2009 but not 2008.

Because 2008 and 2009 are consecutive integers, their divisors generally do not overlap except for 1. Let's confirm the divisors of 2009:

- Factor 2009: 2009 = 7 * 287, and 287 = 7 * 41, so \(2009 = 7^2 \times 41\).

Divisors of 2009 are:

1, 7, 41, 49, 287, 2009.

Check for each whether it divides 2008:

For each divisor d of 2009:

- compute 2008 mod d

- if 2008 mod d != 0, then \(\lfloor 2009 / d \rfloor - \lfloor 2008 / d \rfloor\) = 1, contributing d to the sum.

Thus, we can enumerate \(k\) over these divisors, check if they divide 2008, and sum accordingly.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate divisors of 2009
divisors = [1, 7, 41, 49, 287, 2009]
# Corresponding answer sum
total = 0
for k in divisors:
    if 2008 % k != 0:
        print(k)
        total += k
print("Total sum:", total)
```

This approach efficiently computes the sum by only considering divisors of 2009, checking the relation with 2008, and outputting the candidates immediately.
