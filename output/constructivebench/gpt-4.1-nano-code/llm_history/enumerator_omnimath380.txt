This problem appears to relate to graph coloring, where adjacency and corner adjacency define edges between vertices (positions). The objective is to find minimum numbers of colors needed to properly color these graphs. 

Given the absence of explicit definitions, I will assume the following typical interpretations:
- `Adjacent r₁ r₂` means `|r₁ - r₂| = 1` (adjacent integers).
- `CornerAdjacent r₁ r₂` means `|r₁ - r₂| = 2` (next-to-adjacent integers).

We want to find:
- Minimum `n` so that there exists a coloring of ℕ (or a finite segment) with `n` colors, where adjacent numbers have different colors.
- Minimum `m` for the corner adjacency relation.

Since the real ℕ is infinite, the typical approach in such problems is to determine the minimal number of colors for a finite segment (say, 0 to some upper bound), and then infer the minimums for the infinite case.

Here's a plan:
- For small segments, test the minimal number of colors needed.
- For adjacency (difference 1), the minimal number of colors is 2 (since adjacency forms a path).
- For corner adjacency (difference 2), the minimal number of colors is 3, because it forms a cycle with a length ≥ 4, requiring 3 colors for proper coloring.

I'll code a small enumeration to verify these bounds.

```python
# Enumerate possible minimal colorings for the first few integers, assuming adjacency based on position differences
# with the following interpretations:
# Adjacent: |r1 - r2| = 1
# CornerAdjacent: |r1 - r2| = 2

def min_colors_for_adjacency(max_r):
    # Check minimal colors needed to properly 2-color adjacency graph on 0..max_r
    for n_colors in range(1, 4):
        # Generate all colorings
        for coloring in product(range(n_colors), repeat=max_r + 1):
            valid = True
            for r in range(max_r):
                if coloring[r] == coloring[r+1]:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                yield n_colors
                break

def min_colors_for_corner(max_r):
    # Check minimal colors needed for corner adjacency on 0..max_r
    for n_colors in range(1, 4):
        for coloring in product(range(n_colors), repeat=max_r + 1):
            valid = True
            for r in range(max_r):
                if abs(r - r+2) != 2:
                    # Only check differences of 2
                    continue
                if r+2 <= max_r and coloring[r] == coloring[r+2]:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                yield n_colors
                break

from itertools import product

# For the path of length 10 (indices 0..10)
max_r = 10

# Find minimal colors for adjacency
adj_colors = set(min_colors_for_adjacency(max_r))
# Find minimal colors for corner adjacency
corner_colors = set(min_colors_for_corner(max_r))

print(f"Minimal colors for adjacency (|r1 - r2|=1): {sorted(adj_colors)}")
print(f"Minimal colors for corner adjacency (|r1 - r2|=2): {sorted(corner_colors)}")
```

This code enumerates small segments to infer the minimal number of colors needed for the infinite case, outputting the potential answers.
