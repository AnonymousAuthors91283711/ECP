The problem involves understanding the relationships between the greatest common divisors (gcd) of certain numbers involved in the linear equation \(15a + 14b = c\), with positive integers \(a, b, c\). The key points are:
- \(a, b, c\) are positive.
- The equation relates these numbers with specific coefficients.
- We analyze divisibility and gcd relations involving 14, 15, and 210.

Our goal is to test the conjecture:
\[
(\neg (\gcd(a,14) = 1 \text{ or } \gcd(b,15) = 1)) \implies \neg \gcd(c,210) = 1
\]
and the reverse implications, effectively characterizing when \(\gcd(c,210)=1\) corresponds to particular gcd conditions on \(a\) and \(b\).

Since the problem resembles classic number theory involving divisibility, let's check concrete examples of small positive integers \(a,b\) that satisfy \(15a + 14b = c\). We'll compute \(c\), then check the gcd conditions for each and verify the implications.

We'll generate small \(a, b\), compute \(c\), analyze \(gcd(a,14)\), \(gcd(b,15)\), and \(gcd(c,210)\), and look for counterexamples to the given logical equivalences. This brute-force enumeration helps form conjectures.

```python
import math

# Generate small positive integers a, b and test the conditions
for a in range(1, 20):
    for b in range(1, 20):
        c = 15 * a + 14 * b
        gcd_a_14 = math.gcd(a, 14)
        gcd_b_15 = math.gcd(b, 15)
        gcd_c_210 = math.gcd(c, 210)
        
        premise = not (gcd_a_14 == 1 or gcd_b_15 == 1)  # negation of the 'or' condition
        conclusion1 = not (gcd_c_210 == 1)  # negation of gcd(c,210)=1
        conclusion2 = (gcd_c_210 == 1)
        # Check implications
        # 1. premise => conclusion1
        if premise and not conclusion1:
            print(f"Counterexample: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
        # 2. conclusion2 => premise
        if conclusion2 and not premise:
            print(f"Counterexample: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
        # 3. Equivalence
        if conclusion2 != (not premise):
            print(f"Counterexample: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
```
