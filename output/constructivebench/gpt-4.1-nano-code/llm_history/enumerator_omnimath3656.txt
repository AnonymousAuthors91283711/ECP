The problem seems to involve a Diophantine equation of the form a^2013 + b^2013 = p^n with given parameters and conditions. To enumerate possible solutions, we can consider small candidate values for a, b, p, and n, respecting the constraints (positive, prime conditions). The key is to generate tuples (a,b,p,n) that satisfy the equation, emphasizing exact solutions.

Since the problem asks for exhaustive enumeration focusing on small values, I'll iterate over small a, b, and n, and select small primes p, checking if the sum forms a perfect power p^n.

Here's the program:

```python
import math

# Helper function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(x):
    if x < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.isqrt(x)) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Helper function to check if num is a perfect n-th power
def is_perfect_power(num, n):
    root = int(round(num ** (1 / n)))
    # Check for exact power considering rounding errors
    for candidate in [root, root + 1, root - 1]:
        if candidate > 0 and candidate ** n == num:
            return candidate
    return None

# Enumerate small values under constraints
max_a_b = 5
max_n = 3
p_candidates = [2, 3, 5, 7]

for a in range(1, max_a_b + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_a_b + 1):
        sum_ab = a ** 2013 + b ** 2013
        for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
            for p in p_candidates:
                if is_prime(p):
                    val = p ** n
                    if val == sum_ab:
                        print((a, b, p, n))
```
