This appears to be a formal statement in Lean involving the relation of the Euclidean norm and the sum of two real numbers, likely related to the equality of the hypotenuse and sum in a right triangle (e.g., when a and b are non-negative, the equality might hold only under specific conditions). To explore solutions, we can analyze the equation algebraically for possible (a, b) pairs, especially non-negative reals.

The key equation is:
\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = a + b
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
\]
Subtract \(a^2 + b^2\):
\[
0 = 2ab \implies ab = 0
\]
Thus, either \(a = 0\) or \(b = 0\). For these pairs, the given equality holds. So, solutions are pairs where one is zero, and the other is any real number.

We'll choose sample pairs for \(a, b\) with \(a \ge 0, b \ge 0\), enumerate, and verify the relation.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (a, b) with a, b in [0, 10] to illustrate solutions
# Bookkeeping to ensure only non-negative real solutions since the original equality makes sense in that domain

# Using small sample values for simplicity
max_value = 10
answers = []

# Generate pairs with one coordinate zero
for a in range(max_value + 1):
    b = 0
    print(f"Testing (a, b) = ({a}, {b})")
    if (a ** 2 + b ** 2) ** 0.5 == a + b:
        print(f"Answer candidate: a={a}, b={b}")
        answers.append((a, b))
for b in range(max_value + 1):
    a = 0
    print(f"Testing (a, b) = ({a}, {b})")
    if (a ** 2 + b ** 2) ** 0.5 == a + b:
        print(f"Answer candidate: a={a}, b={b}")
        answers.append((a, b))
```
