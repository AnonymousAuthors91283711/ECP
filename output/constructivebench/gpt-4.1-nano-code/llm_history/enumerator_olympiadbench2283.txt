The problem involves iterating a function P on a point (x, y), which performs three steps:
1. Reflect in x-axis: (x, y) → (x, -y)
2. Translate upward by 2: (x, y) → (x, y + 2)
3. Reflect in y-axis: (x, y) → (-x, y)

Combined, P(x, y) = (-x, -(y - 2)). We want to analyze the 6-fold application of P, P^[6], and find the original point S₀ such that after 6 iterations, the point becomes (-7, -1).

To solve this, we can:
- Compute the inverse transformations, or
- Iteratively apply P backwards 6 times to find all possible starting points S₀ that could reach (-7, -1), and then verify which yields the specific endpoint.

Since the transformation after 6 steps is complex, but P is invertible, we can:
- Compute P⁻¹ directly (since P is bijective),
- Then iterate P⁻¹ backwards 6 times on (-7, -1),
- For each such candidate, check whether applying P 6 times yields (-7, -1).

Because the process can generate multiple solutions, we'll:
- Implement the inverse P,
- Generate all possible previous points step-by-step,
- For each candidate, verify the forward iteration.

Here is the code:

```python
# Define P and its inverse
def P(point):
    x, y = point
    return (-x, -(y - 2))

def P_inv(point):
    x, y = point
    # Inverse of P: solve P(x, y) = (x', y') for (x, y)
    # Given P(x, y) = (-x, -(y - 2))
    # So:
    # x' = -x => x = -x'
    # y' = -(y - 2) => y - 2 = - y' => y = - y' + 2
    x_prime, y_prime = point
    return (-x_prime, - y_prime + 2)

# Compute all candidates by iterating backwards 6 times from target (-7, -1)
target = (-7, -1)
candidates = set([target])

for _ in range(6):
    new_candidates = set()
    for pt in candidates:
        prev_pt = P_inv(pt)
        new_candidates.add(prev_pt)
    candidates = new_candidates

# For each candidate, verify if applying P 6 times yields the target
def apply_P_times(point, n):
    for _ in range(n):
        point = P(point)
    return point

# Collect all valid seeds S0
valid_S0s = []
for c in candidates:
    if apply_P_times(c, 6) == target:
        valid_S0s.append(c)
        print(f"Candidate seed: {c}")

# If multiple, set the answer as the minimal lex order among solutions
if valid_S0s:
    olympiadbench2283_answer = min(valid_S0s)
else:
    # No solutions found
    olympiadbench2283_answer = (0,0)  # fallback

# Define the theorem statement
theorem_statement = (
    f"(P^[6]) S₀ = ({target[0]}, {target[1]}) "
    f"↔ S₀ = {olympiadbench2283_answer}"
)

print(theorem_statement)
```
