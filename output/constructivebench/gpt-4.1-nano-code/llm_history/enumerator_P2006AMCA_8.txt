This appears to be a formalization of a combinatorial problem involving counting pairs (p : ℕ × ℕ) with certain inequalities and a sum condition. The goal is to enumerate solutions that satisfy:

- p.1 > 0
- p.2 > 1
- The sum of integers from 0 up to p.1 + p.2 - 1 (excluding the endpoint) equals 15

In particular, the sum s = ∑_{x=0}^{p.1 + p.2 - 1} x = (p.1 + p.2 - 1)(p.1 + p.2)/2

We need to count pairs (p.1, p.2) satisfying p.1 > 0, p.2 > 1, and this sum equals 15.

**Approach:**
- Fix small sample values for p.1 and p.2, verify the sum condition, and count matches.
- Print each candidate solution immediately.
- Since the sum formula involves only p.1 + p.2, iterate over small sums.

```python
# Enumerate possible (p1, p2) for small positive p1 and p2.
# We use the sum formula for integers from 0 to n-1: sum = n(n-1)/2 with n = p1 + p2
# We want sum == 15 => n(n-1)/2 == 15 => n(n-1) == 30 => n^2 - n - 30 = 0

import math

# Solve quadratic for n: n^2 - n - 30 = 0
discriminant = 1 + 4*30  # 1 + 120 = 121
sqrt_disc = int(math.isqrt(discriminant))  # 11

# n = (1 ± sqrt_disc) / 2
n1 = (1 + sqrt_disc) / 2  # 6.0
n2 = (1 - sqrt_disc) / 2  # -5.0

# Only positive integer n
candidate_n = [int(n1)]  # [6], since n2 is negative

# For each n, find p1 + p2 = n, with p1 > 0 and p2 > 1
# so p1 from 1 to n-1, p2 = n - p1, check p2 > 1
for p1 in range(1, candidate_n[0]):
    p2 = candidate_n[0] - p1
    if p2 > 1:
        print((p1, p2))
```
