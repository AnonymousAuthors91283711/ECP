This problem appears to be about parameters and the relationships between the rectangle's width `w`, length `l`, and perimeter `k`, with constraints linking them. To find the possible values of `k`, we need to analyze these constraints and find consistent values. The key constraints are:

- `l = 3 * w`
- `2 * (l + w) = k` (perimeter)
- `l * w = k` (area)

Substituting `l = 3 w` into the perimeter condition:

`k = 2 * (3 w + w) = 2 * 4 w = 8 w`

Similarly, the area condition:

`k = l * w = 3 w * w = 3 w^2`

Combining the two:

`8 w = 3 w^2`

Assuming `w > 0` (since `k > 0` and dimensions should be positive):

`8 w = 3 w^2`  
Divide both sides by `w`:

`8 = 3 w`  
=> `w = 8 / 3`

Now, compute `k`:

`k = 8 w = 8 * (8/3) = 64 / 3`

This suggests that under the given constraints, the only possible `k` (perimeter) is `64/3`. To verify or explore other solutions (if any), we can check for numerical approximations or small perturbations.

```python
# Enumerate possible `w` values near the derived value, within a small range
w_exact = 8 / 3  # exact
k_exact = 8 * w_exact  # perimeter from the relation
area = 3 * w_exact ** 2

# Since the equations are consistent only at this w, w, k,
# generate small perturbations to simulate possible solutions.

import math

# Tolerance for perturbations
tol = 1e-4

# Generate candidate w values around the exact solution
w_candidates = [w_exact + delta for delta in [-0.05, -0.02, 0, 0.02, 0.05]]

for w in w_candidates:
    # Calculate perimeter and area for each candidate
    k_candidates = [2 * (3 * w + w), 3 * w ** 2]
    # Round to avoid floating point issues
    k_candidates = [round(k, 6) for k in k_candidates]
    # Check if they are approximately equal
    if abs(k_candidates[0] - k_candidates[1]) < tol:
        print(f"w: {w:.4f}, perimeter: {k_candidates[0]:.4f}, area: {k_candidates[1]:.4f}")
```
