The problem involves a set \( A \subseteq \{1, \dots, 3000\} \) with exactly 2000 elements, such that for each \( x \in A \), the value \( 2x \) is not in \( A \). We need to explore whether such an \( A \) exists, and if so, find an example or verify conditions. A key aspect is to understand the constraints imposed by the doubling condition and the set size.

To enumerate possible answer candidates:
- Choose small values for \( x \) to see which elements can or cannot be in \( A \).
- As \( 2x \) must not be in \( A \), for smaller \( x \), the doubling "pairs" \( (x, 2x) \) are relevant.
- Our goal is to explore the maximum possible size of such a set \( A \) and verify if it can be size 2000.

Given these, we'll:
- Generate small sample sets based on doubling restrictions.
- Attempt to find a maximal subset avoiding both duplicates and doubling conflicts.
- Since the total set size is 3000, and \( A \) has size 2000, check if constructing such an \( A \) is plausible.

Here's a Python exploration focusing on:
- Enumerating candidates up to a small threshold
- Respect restriction \( x \in A \Rightarrow 2x \notin A \)
- Outputting findings immediately

```python
# Program to explore sets A ⊆ [1,3000], |A|=2000, with no element x satisfying 2x ∈ A
# We attempt to construct large A by avoiding pairs (x, 2x)

MAX_N = 3000
desired_size = 2000

# Strategy:
# Use greedy approach: include smallest numbers unless their doubled is already in the set

A = set()
excluded = set()

for x in range(1, MAX_N + 1):
    if x not in excluded:
        # include x
        A.add(x)
        # exclude 2x to avoid doubling conflict
        if 2 * x <= MAX_N:
            excluded.add(2 * x)
    if len(A) >= desired_size:
        print(f"Constructed set of size {len(A)} with doubling constraints.")
        break

print("Sample set A:", sorted(A))
print("Total elements in A:", len(A))
```
