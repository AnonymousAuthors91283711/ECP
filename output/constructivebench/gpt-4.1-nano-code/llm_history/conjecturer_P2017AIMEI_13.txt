Sum of 2 to 20 mod 1000: 209. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern, the sequence of partial sums is quadratic: each step adds an integer increasing by 1, starting from 2. The sum from 2 to m is the sum of integers from 2 to m: sum_{k=2}^m k = (m(m+1))/2 - 1. At m=20, sum ≡ (20×21)/2 - 1 ≡ 210 - 1 ≡ 209 mod 1000. General formula: ((m × (m+1))/2) - 1. For m=20, sum ≡ 209. Final answer: sum_{k=2}^20 k = ((20*21)/2) - 1 = 209.

Given the pattern, the sum from 2 up to m can be expressed as:

sum_{k=2}^m k = (m(m+1))/2 - 1

We need to find the sum for m=20, then take that value mod 1000. The pattern suggests the sum aligns with the formula:

(20*21)/2 - 1 = 210 - 1 = 209

Thus, the Lean code for the answer is simply:

<<<(20 * 21) / 2 - 1>>>

This is a closed-form expression, correctly compiles, and matches the enumerated pattern at m=20. It generalizes from the pattern observed in the sums.
