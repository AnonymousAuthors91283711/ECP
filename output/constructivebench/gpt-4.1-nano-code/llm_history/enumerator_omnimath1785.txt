The given problem appears to be about finding the counts (r, g, b) of three categories (colors or groups) that sum to 97, satisfying a specific quadratic relationship involving their pairwise combinations, and ultimately demonstrating that a certain function involving these counts equals 41/97. 

To help analyze this, I will systematically enumerate possible integer triples (r, g, b) with non-negative values summing to 97, and filter those that satisfy the quadratic condition. Among these, I will compute or verify the value of the target function, looking for the result 41/97. Since the problem likely has a unique or obvious solution, enumerating small ranges is sufficient given the sum constraint.

Because the key part is to match the condition (r * (r - 1) + g * (g - 1) + b * (b - 1)) * 12 = (97 * 96) * 5, I will focus on candidate triples that satisfy this quadratic relation, then print the corresponding value of the function. The goal is to find all solutions that satisfy the conditions and to ensure the code efficiently filters without unnecessary checks.

```python
# Enumerate all triples (r, g, b) with non-negative integers summing to 97
# satisfying the given quadratic relation, and check if the target function equals 41/97.

target_sum = 97
total_pairs = 97 * 96  # total pairs among 97 items
desired_total = total_pairs * 5 // 12  # since (r*(r-1)+g*(g-1)+b*(b-1))*12 = total_pairs*5

# Efficient search: since r + g + b = 97, iterate over r and g, compute b directly.
# For each triple, check the quadratic condition, then compute the function value.

for r in range(target_sum + 1):
    for g in range(target_sum - r + 1):
        b = target_sum - r - g
        if b < 0:
            continue
        sum_pairs = r * (r - 1) + g * (g - 1) + b * (b - 1)
        if sum_pairs * 12 == total_pairs * 5:
            # Compute the target answer if needed
            # Since the function is given as omnimath1785_answer r g b = 41/97, with no variation,
            # we simply print identified solutions:
            print(f"r={r}, g={g}, b={b}")
```
