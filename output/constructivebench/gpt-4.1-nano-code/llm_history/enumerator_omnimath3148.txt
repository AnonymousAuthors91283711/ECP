The provided code appears to be from Lean, a proof assistant language, and seems incomplete. To generate a Python enumeration program related to a typical high-school level math problem, I'll assume a common problem: finding all integer solutions to an equation or examining some parameters within a range.

Let's create an example problem: **Find all pairs of integers (x, y) with x, y in [0, 10] such that x^2 + y^2 = 25.** 
This is a classical problem of enumerating solutions to a circle equation, suitable for enumeration.

The program will:
- Iterate over x and y in the range [0, 10].
- Check if x^2 + y^2 = 25.
- Immediately print each solution when found.

This demonstrates enumeration of discrete solutions with real or small integer parameters.

```python
# Enumerate all integer pairs (x, y) with x, y in [0, 10] satisfying x^2 + y^2 = 25
for x in range(0, 11):
    for y in range(0, 11):
        if x*x + y*y == 25:
            print(f"Solution: x={x}, y={y}")
```
