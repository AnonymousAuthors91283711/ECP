This problem involves finding specific rational numbers defined by four digits (a,b,c,d), with a nonzero digit, and considering the numerator values of these fractions when simplified and their coprimality with the denominator. The goal is to determine the last three digits of the count of distinct numerators generated by these fractions. 

To approach this, we'll:
- Iterate over all digit combinations (a,b,c,d) within 0â€“9, ensuring the at least one is non-zero.
- Compute the fraction (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) / 9999.
- Simplify the fraction to its lowest terms and record the numerator.
- Collect all unique numerators.
- Compute the size of this set, modulo 1000.

Given the small digit range, brute-force enumeration is feasible and efficient. We'll print the intermediate numerators as they are found. This helps in conjecture and verification, and the code uses minimal computation for efficiency.

```python
# Enumerate all 4-digit combinations (a,b,c,d) with at least one non-zero digit
numerators = set()

for a in range(10):
    for b in range(10):
        for c in range(10):
            for d in range(10):
                if a == 0 and b == 0 and c == 0 and d == 0:
                    continue  # at least one digit must be non-zero
                numerator = 1000*a + 100*b + 10*c + d
                denominator = 9999
                from math import gcd
                g = gcd(numerator, denominator)
                num = numerator // g
                den = denominator // g
                # Ensure numerator is positive (it is, since numerator >= 1)
                print(f"Found numerator: {num}")
                numerators.add(num)

# After collection, compute the size modulo 1000
result = len(numerators) % 1000
print(f"Final result (number of distinct numerators mod 1000): {result}")
```
