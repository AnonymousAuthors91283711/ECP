The given equations are \(a \cdot 2^b = 8\) and \(a^b = 2\). Solving these for \(a\) and \(b\): from \(a^b = 2 \Rightarrow a = 2^{1/b}\). Substituting into \(a \cdot 2^b = 8\):
\[
2^{1/b} \cdot 2^b = 8 \Rightarrow 2^{1/b + b} = 8 = 2^3
\]
so \(1/b + b = 3\), leading to \(b^2 - 3b + 1=0\). Since \(a=2^{1/b}\), and \(a \cdot 2^b = 8\), we can express the answer as \(a b 2^{b}\). Given the form and exponents, the pattern suggests the answer is \(128\).
