Ground Truth Answer: 15
Proposed Answer: if 15 * 35 ≥ 500 then 15 else 16
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer correctly identifies that 15 is the minimal natural number n such that there exists a function k from Fin n to ℕ with the sum of k i * 35 over all i being at least 500. The condition "if 15 * 35 ≥ 500 then 15 else 16" evaluates to 15 because 15 * 35 = 525 ≥ 500, which matches the ground truth answer. The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer.
