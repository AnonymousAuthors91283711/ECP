  {3, 5/2, √10} = {x | x ∈ omnimath3531_answer} := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (1.25, 3, 3.1622776601683795). Expected Answer Type: List ℝ
The answer list must contain the enumerated solutions 1.25, 3, and √10, sorted in non-decreasing order. The explicit list in Lean can be written as [1.25, 3, √10].
