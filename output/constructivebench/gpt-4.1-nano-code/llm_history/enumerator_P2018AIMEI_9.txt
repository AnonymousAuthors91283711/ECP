The given problem involves a set \( S \subseteq \{0,1,\dots,20\} \) with exactly 4 elements, satisfying:
- There exist two distinct elements \(a, b \in S\) with \(a + b = 16\).
- There exist two distinct elements \(c, d \in S\) with \(c + d = 24\).

Our goal is to find the number of such sets \(S\) (or some characteristic of them). To aid in conjecture and proof, we will enumerate all possible sets satisfying the conditions, then analyze their structure.

Steps:
- Find all pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a, b \in \{0,\dots,20\}\), \(a \neq b\), and \(a + b = 16\).
- Find all pairs \((c, d)\) where \(c, d \in \{0,\dots,20\}\), \(c \neq d\), and \(c + d = 24\).
- For each such pair combo, find all 4-element sets \(S\) containing these pairs (since the pairs must be part of \(S\)), and check whether the set contains exactly 4 distinct elements.

Here's a Python script to do this enumeration efficiently:

```python
# Enumerate pairs summing to 16 and 24
sum_16_pairs = [(a, 16 - a) for a in range(0, 17) if 0 <= 16 - a <= 20 and a != 16 - a]
sum_24_pairs = [(c, 24 - c) for c in range(0, 21) if 0 <= 24 - c <= 20 and c != 24 - c]

# Convert pairs to sets for easier merging
sum_16_pairs_sets = [set(pair) for pair in sum_16_pairs]
sum_24_pairs_sets = [set(pair) for pair in sum_24_pairs]

answers = []

# For each combination, combine pair sets and find 4-element solutions
for s16 in sum_16_pairs_sets:
    for s24 in sum_24_pairs_sets:
        union = s16.union(s24)
        if len(union) == 4:
            # Found a valid set S
            print(sorted(union))
            answers.append(sorted(union))
# Print total count if needed
print(f"Total such sets: {len(answers)}")
```
