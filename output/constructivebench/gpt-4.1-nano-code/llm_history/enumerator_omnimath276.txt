The problem appears to ask whether there exists a set of integers \(X \subseteq \mathbb{Z}\) such that for every integer \(n\), the set of pairs \((p_1, p_2)\) with \(p_1 + 2p_2 = n\) and both \(p_1, p_2 \in X\) has exactly one element. Equivalently, for each \(n\), there is exactly one solution \(\displaystyle (p_1, p_2) \in X^2\) satisfying \(p_1 + 2 p_2 = n\).

Let's analyze the problem:

- For a fixed \(n\), the solutions to \(p_1 + 2 p_2 = n\) can be described parametrically.
- Since we're only considering \(p_1, p_2 \in X\), the set \(X\) must be such that for each \(n\), exactly one pair \((p_1, p_2)\) with \(p_1 + 2 p_2 = n\) exists inside \(X\).

The key is the uniqueness of solutions for each \(n\). For the solutions to be unique for all \(n\), the set \(X\) must intersect each line \(p_1 + 2 p_2 = n\) in exactly one point, and points on different lines should not "overlap" in such a way that an element satisfies multiple such lines.

Testing this idea, the crucial aspect is that the constraints should lead to a set \(X\) designed as \(\displaystyle \{a + 2b : a, b \in X \}\), with a consistent pattern.

Let's attempt enumeration over small ranges of \(\mathbb{Z}\). We will:

- Define \(X\) as an arbitrary subset of small integers.
- For each \(n\) in a small range, check whether there is exactly one pair \((p_1, p_2)\) with both elements in \(X\) that satisfy \(p_1 + 2 p_2 = n\).

If such an \(X\) exists, it would be hardcoded with small elements; otherwise, we explore options.

Here's a Python script to iterate over small candidate subsets \(X\) and verify the condition for \(n\) in some small range:

```python
# Enumerate small subsets of integers and check the uniqueness condition
import itertools

# Generate all subsets of integers within a small range
candidate_range = range(-3, 4)  # small integers from -3 to 3
all_subsets = []
for size in range(1, 5):  # small subsets of size 1 to 4
    for subset in itertools.chain(itertools.combinations(candidate_range, size)):
        all_subsets.append(set(subset))

# Check the property for each subset
for X in all_subsets:
    valid = True
    # Check for n in a small range, say from -6 to 6
    for n in range(-6, 7):
        solutions = []
        for p2 in X:
            p1 = n - 2 * p2
            if p1 in X:
                solutions.append((p1, p2))
        if len(solutions) != 1:
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        print(f"Candidate X: {sorted(X)} satisfies the property for n in [-6,6]")
        # Also print for extended n if desired
```

This code searches for sets \(X\) within small bounds that satisfy the condition for \(n\) from \(-6\) to 6. The output will be the candidate sets that meet the criterion, which can help in conjecturing the structure or identifying whether such \(X\) exists.

```python
# Enumerate small subsets of integers and check the uniqueness condition
import itertools

candidate_range = range(-3, 4)  # small integers from -3 to 3
for size in range(1, 5):
    for subset in itertools.combinations(candidate_range, size):
        X = set(subset)
        valid = True
        for n in range(-6, 7):
            solutions = []
            for p2 in X:
                p1 = n - 2 * p2
                if p1 in X:
                    solutions.append((p1, p2))
            if len(solutions) != 1:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            print(f"Candidate X: {sorted(X)} satisfies the property for n in [-6,6]")
```
