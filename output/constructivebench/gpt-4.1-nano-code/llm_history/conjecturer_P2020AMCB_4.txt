theorem P2020AMCB_4 : 
  IsLeast {b : ℕ | ∃ (a : ℕ), a > b ∧ Nat.Prime a ∧ Nat.Prime b ∧ a + b = 90} P2020AMCB_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: b = 7. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem seeks the least b such that there exists an a with a > b, both are prime, and a + b = 90. Given the pattern (b = 7), the smallest such b with these properties is 7. The only a satisfying a + b = 90 with a > b = 7 and both prime is a = 83, which is prime. Lower b's such as 2, 3, 5 are invalid (no suitable a > b). So, final answer: 7.
