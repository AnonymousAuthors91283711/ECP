The problem appears to involve finding the least positive integer \(k\) such that the iterative application of a piecewise-defined function \(f\) (dependent on parameters \(a, b\)) starting from 0 returns to 0. Since the formal statement is in Lean (a proof assistant), but we're asked to write a Python enumeration script, my goal is to simulate the process: for given small parameters \(a, b\) with \(1 \leq a \le b\), enumerate candidate \(k\) values until the condition holds, and identify the least such \(k\).

I'll set specific small example parameters \(a, b\), then simulate the iteration of \(f\) to find the minimal \(k\) with \(f^{k}(0) = 0\). Because the problem involves iteration and piecewise functions, I'll focus on small \(\max b\) to keep the enumeration manageable.

**Note**:
- We won't hardcode the answer, but by trying small values, we can observe the pattern.
- We will print each found \(k\) immediately.
- For simplicity, pick \(a = 1, b = 2\) as a sample, then show the enumeration process.
- To be generic, include small ranges of \(a, b\) to test.

```python
# Program to enumerate the least k such that applying f k times starting from 0 returns to 0
# for small parameters a, b with 1 <= a <= b <= 5, to simulate the problem

def f(n, a, b, M):
    # Piecewise function based on n and M
    if n <= M:
        return n + a
    else:
        return n - b

def iterate_f(start, a, b, max_iter=50):
    # Returns the sequence of iterates until cycle, or max_iter
    seq = []
    current = start
    for _ in range(max_iter):
        seq.append(current)
        current = f(current, a, b, (a + b) // 2)
        if current == start:
            return seq
    return seq

# Select small ranges for a and b
for a in range(1, 4):
    for b in range(a, 6):
        print(f"Parameters: a = {a}, b = {b}")
        M = (a + b) // 2
        for k in range(1, 21):  # test first 20 iterations
            val = 0
            for _ in range(k):
                val = f(val, a, b, M)
            if val == 0:
                print(f"  Found minimal k = {k}")
                break
```
