The problem appears to involve parameters with known values and a set of equations inducing a relationship among the variables. We suspect the goal is to find the value of `m` given certain constraints involving `b1`, `b2`, `b3`, and `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, with the key condition being that `x1 + x2 + x3 = 36`. The variables `b1`, `b2`, `b3` are fixed at 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

Given the definitions:
- `x1 = -b1/m = -2/m`
- `x2 = -b2/m = -3/m`
- `x3 = -b3/m = -4/m`

The sum condition:
\[ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 36 \]

Substituting:
\[ -\frac{2}{m} - \frac{3}{m} - \frac{4}{m} = 36 \]
\[ -\frac{2 + 3 + 4}{m} = 36 \]
\[ -\frac{9}{m} = 36 \]

Multiply both sides by `m`:
\[ -9 = 36m \]

Solve for `m`:
\[ m = -\frac{9}{36} = -\frac{1}{4} \]

Thus, the value of `m` that satisfies the constraints is `-1/4`. To assist in the maximization/minimization or verification, we will implement a search over a small range of values for `m`.

```python
# Enumerate potential m values around the derived estimate
possible_m_values = [round(-1/4, 4) + delta/10000 for delta in range(-100, 101)]  # A small range around -0.25
for m in possible_m_values:
    x1 = -2 / m
    x2 = -3 / m
    x3 = -4 / m
    sum_x = x1 + x2 + x3
    # Check if sum is close enough to 36 to account for floating point precision
    if abs(sum_x - 36) < 1e-8:
        print(f"Found m = {m}")
        print(f"x1 = {x1}, x2 = {x2}, x3 = {x3}, sum = {sum_x}")
```
