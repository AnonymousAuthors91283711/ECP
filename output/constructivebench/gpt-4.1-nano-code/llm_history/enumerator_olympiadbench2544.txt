This problem involves analyzing the equation √a + √b = √50 for natural numbers a and b with constraints 0 < a < b. To aid in conjecturing, I will write a Python script that enumerates possible pairs (a, b) with small values, checks the approximate equality, and prints all candidates where the sum of square roots is close to √50, prioritizing exact matches where possible.

Since √50 ≈ 7.071, we focus on integer pairs (a, b) where their square roots sum closely to this value. We can limit a and b to small numbers (e.g., up to 100) for computational efficiency and to find all plausible solutions.

```python
import math

# Approximate value of sqrt(50)
target = math.sqrt(50)
tolerance = 1e-6

max_value = 100  # limit for enumeration
for a in range(1, max_value):
    sqrt_a = math.sqrt(a)
    for b in range(a+1, max_value):
        sqrt_b = math.sqrt(b)
        sum_sqrt = sqrt_a + sqrt_b
        # Check for exact equality or close approximation
        if abs(sum_sqrt - target) < tolerance:
            print(f"(a={a}, b={b}) with sqrt_a={sqrt_a:.4f}, sqrt_b={sqrt_b:.4f} sums to {sum_sqrt:.6f}")
```
