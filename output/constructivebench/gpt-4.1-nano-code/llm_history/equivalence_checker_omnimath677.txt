Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2^n - 2) / 3
Proposed Answer: fun n => (1 + 2^n) / 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the sum of binomial coefficients C(n,k) where k ≡ 1 mod 3.

2. The ground truth answer is (2^n - 2)/3, which comes from:
   - Using roots of unity filter to extract terms where k ≡ 1 mod 3
   - The general formula for this case is (2^n + ω^(n-1) + ω^(2n-2))/3 where ω is a primitive 3rd root of unity
   - When n is not divisible by 3, this simplifies to (2^n - 1)/3 (but the ground truth shows (2^n - 2)/3)

3. The proposed answer is (1 + 2^n)/3, which doesn't match either the general formula or the specific case.

4. Testing with n=1:
   - Ground truth: (2-2)/3 = 0 (correct, since only k=0,1 are considered, and C(1,1)=1 but k=1 ≡1 mod3, so sum should be 1)
   - Proposed: (1+2)/3 = 1 (matches actual sum)
   - This shows the ground truth might be incorrect for n=1

5. Testing with n=2:
   - Ground truth: (4-2)/3 = 2/3 (incorrect, should be C(2,1)=2)
   - Proposed: (1+4)/3 = 5/3 (incorrect)

6. Testing with n=4:
   - Sum should be C(4,1) + C(4,4) = 4 + 1 = 5
   - Ground truth: (16-2)/3 = 14/3 ≈ 4.666...
   - Proposed: (1+16)/3 = 17/3 ≈ 5.666...

Conclusion: Neither answer is completely correct, but the proposed answer is closer to being correct for some values of n, though still not matching the exact formula. The ground truth appears to be incorrect for several cases.
