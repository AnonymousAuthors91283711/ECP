The problem involves finding a value `k + 1` (represented as `omnimath3195_answer`) that satisfies certain conditions for some `c` in the range [5, 10]. Specifically, for some `c` and `k`, `(c - 1) * k + (k + 1) = 100`. Additionally, the goal is to identify the unique `k + 1` value satisfying this relation for some `c` in the given range, with the minimal or maximum constrained by the theorem.

Since the theorem restricts `c` to be between 5 and 10, inclusive, and involves solving `(c - 1) * k + (k + 1) = 100` for `k`, we can enumerate `c` and solve for `k` directly. For each candidate, we check if `k` is an integer and then return `k + 1`.

```python
# Enumerate c from 5 to 10
for c in range(5, 11):
    denom = c - 1
    # Solve for k:
    # (c - 1) * k + (k + 1) = 100
    # (c - 1 + 1) * k + 1 = 100
    # c * k = 99
    if 99 % c == 0:
        k = (99 // c) - 1  # subtract 1 because (k + 1) is involved
        answer = k + 1
        print(answer)
```
