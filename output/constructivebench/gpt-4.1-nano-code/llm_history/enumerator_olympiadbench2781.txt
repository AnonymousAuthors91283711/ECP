The problem involves analyzing the roots of the quadratic \( x^2 + (m+n)x + m n = 0 \) with the parameters \( m=7 \), \( n=8 \), and \( T=7/8 \). It appears we're asked to find the least element among the roots excluding \(-n\), likely considering the roots of the quadratic and their relation to \(-n\). To assist in conjecturing the answer, I'll compute the roots explicitly and filter the roots according to the criteria, then identify the least root not equal to \(-n\).

The steps:
- Set given parameters.
- Compute roots of the quadratic \( x^2 + 15x + 56 = 0 \).
- Find roots, exclude the root equal to \(-8\).
- Among remaining roots, find the minimal value.

```python
import math

# Parameters
m = 7
n = 8
sum_mn = m + n  # 15
product_mn = m * n  # 56

# Quadratic coefficients
a = 1
b = sum_mn  # 15
c = product_mn  # 56

# Compute roots
discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
sqrt_discriminant = math.isqrt(discriminant) if discriminant >= 0 else None

if discriminant >= 0:
    root1 = (-b + sqrt_discriminant) / (2 * a)
    root2 = (-b - sqrt_discriminant) / (2 * a)
    roots = {root1, root2}
else:
    roots = set()

# Exclude -n (which is -8)
excluded_root = -n
filtered_roots = {r for r in roots if abs(r - excluded_root) > 1e-12}

# Find the least root among remaining
if filtered_roots:
    least_root = min(filtered_roots)
    print(least_root)
```
