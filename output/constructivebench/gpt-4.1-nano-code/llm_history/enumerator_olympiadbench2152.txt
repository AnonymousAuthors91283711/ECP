[write_program]
The provided code snippet appears to be a formalization (likely in Lean or a similar theorem prover language) involving finite functions and properties related to triples of grid points, with conditions on a Boolean function `f`. The goal seems to connect the maximum size (`ncard`) of certain sets of triples satisfying conditions involving `f`.

To mimic this type of problem and output possible answers, I will create a Python script that models a similar scenario on a small grid, enumerates all functions `f` with constraints, and outputs all candidate maximal sizes.

Given the instructions:

- We will consider small parameters, for example, a 3x3 grid instead of 999x999.
- We will generate functions `f` mapping grid points to True/False.
- For each `f`, count the triples `(r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3)` satisfying the conditions.
- Collect the maximum `ncard` observed.
- Print each candidate as found, in order.

This approach helps in conjecturing the maximum count of such triples.

```python
# Modeling an analogous problem on a small 3x3 grid for enumeration
# We seek to find the maximum number of triples ((r1,c1),(r2,c2),(r3,c3))
# satisfying r1 = r2, c2 = c3, f(r1,c1)=True, f(r2,c2)=False, f(r3,c3)=True for some function.
# We will exhaustively enumerate all functions f: grid ->  {True, False} for small grid.

from itertools import product, permutations

size = 3  # Small grid for feasibility
grid_points = [(r, c) for r in range(size) for c in range(size)]

max_count = 0

# Store all maximum sets
candidate_sets = []

# Generate all functions from grid points to Boolean (2^(size*size))
for bits in range(2 ** (size * size)):
    f = {}
    for i, point in enumerate(grid_points):
        f[point] = (bits & (1 << i)) != 0

    # Count triples satisfying the conditions
    count = 0
    for r1 in range(size):
        for c1 in range(size):
            for r2 in range(size):
                for c2 in range(size):
                    for r3 in range(size):
                        for c3 in range(size):
                            # Conditions:
                            # r1 = r2, c2 = c3
                            if r1 == r2 and c2 == c3:
                                if f[(r1, c1)] and not f[(r2, c2)] and f[(r3, c3)]:
                                    count += 1

    # Check if we found a new max
    if count > max_count:
        max_count = count
        candidate_sets = [count]
        print(f"Found new max count: {count} with f bits = {bin(bits)}")
    elif count == max_count:
        print(f"Another set with max count {count} found with f bits = {bin(bits)}")
        candidate_sets.append(count)

# Output the maximum count found
print(f"Maximum number of triples satisfying conditions: {max_count}")
```
