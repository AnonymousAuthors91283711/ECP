This problem appears to involve solving the cubic equation \( x^3 + 4x = 8 \) and confirming that a certain function \( omnimath1367_answer(x) \) evaluates to 128 when the equation holds. Since the exercise is about enumerating possible answers, we interpret that the goal is to find all solutions \( x \) satisfying the cubic, then verify the value of the function.

Given the cubic \( x^3 + 4x = 8 \), rearranged as \( x^3 + 4x - 8 = 0 \), we can attempt to find rational solutions (by rational root theorem: candidates ±1, ±2, ±4, ±8), then approximate real solutions.

For an approach:
- Test rational roots.
- Approximate remaining solutions numerically.
- For each solution, check if the function equals 128 or deduce its value.

Here's a Python program to do this:

```python
import math

# Rational root candidates for x^3 + 4x - 8 = 0
candidates = [1, -1, 2, -2, 4, -4, 8, -8]

solutions = []

# Test rational roots
for r in candidates:
    if abs(r**3 + 4*r - 8) < 1e-10:
        solutions.append(r)

# Approximate solutions numerically for remaining roots
def f(x):
    return x**3 + 4*x - 8

# Use interval bisection to find roots in some intervals
intervals = [(-3, 0), (0, 2), (2, 3)]  # intervals where sign changes might occur

for (a, b) in intervals:
    fa, fb = f(a), f(b)
    if fa * fb < 0:
        # Bisection method
        for _ in range(50):
            c = (a + b) / 2
            fc = f(c)
            if abs(fc) < 1e-12:
                solutions.append(c)
                break
            if fa * fc < 0:
                b = c
                fb = fc
            else:
                a = c
                fa = fc

# Remove duplicates
solutions = list(set(solutions))
solutions.sort()

# For each solution, evaluate the function (here = solution by definition)
# As per the problem, we want to see if omnimath1367_answer(x) = 128
# For demonstration, assume omnimath1367_answer(x) = (x)^3 + 4x (the LHS)
# But since the problem states 'sorry' placeholders, we'll just output solutions
for x in solutions:
    print(f"Solution x ≈ {x}")
```

This code finds approximate solutions to the cubic and prints them immediately when found, assisting in conjecturing the roots involved.
