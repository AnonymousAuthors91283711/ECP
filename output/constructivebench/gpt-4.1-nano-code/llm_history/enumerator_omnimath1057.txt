Your problem appears to involve finding the number of 4-variable functions `s : Fin 4 → ℕ` satisfying:

- All values are positive: `s i > 0` for each `i`.
- The sum is 16: `s 0 + s 1 + s 2 + s 3 = 16`.
- Each `s i` is at most the sum of the other three: `s i ≤ sum of the other three`.

This is a combinatorial counting problem under inequality constraints.

Approach:
- Enumerate all positive quadruples with sum 16 (using stars-and-bars).
- Check if each quadruple satisfies the inequality `s i ≤ sum of other s j`.
- Count valid quadruples; print each answer immediately.

```python
# Enumerate all positive quadruples with sum 16
# For sum = 16, positive integers s0, s1, s2, s3 with s0+s1+s2+s3=16
# Use nested loops for s0, s1, s2, s3 >=1 summing to 16
# Check inequalities for each quadruple and print possibilities

def main():
    total_count = 0
    for s0 in range(1, 16):  # s0 at least 1
        for s1 in range(1, 17 - s0):
            for s2 in range(1, 17 - s0 - s1):
                s3 = 16 - s0 - s1 - s2
                if s3 >= 1:
                    s = (s0, s1, s2, s3)
                    total_sum = sum(s)
                    # Check inequalities
                    valid = True
                    for i in range(4):
                        others_sum = total_sum - s[i]
                        if s[i] > others_sum:
                            valid = False
                            break
                    if valid:
                        print(s)
                        total_count += 1
    print(f"Total valid solutions: {total_count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
