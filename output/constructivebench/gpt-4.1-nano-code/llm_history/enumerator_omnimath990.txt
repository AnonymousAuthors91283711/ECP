[write_program]
This problem appears to involve finding the sum of a series of the form ∑ (a * i) / (a^i) for i from 0 to infinity, where a > 1. To assist in the conjecture and proof, I will implement a Python program that enumerates the partial sums of this series for various values of a > 1, focusing on small sample values. The goal is to observe pattern behavior and possibly infer the sum's closed form or convergence value.

The approach:
- Select small sample parameters for a, for example a = 1.5, 2, 3.
- For each a, compute partial sums up to a large number of terms (e.g., 50 or 100) to approximate the infinite sum.
- Print each partial sum as it is computed for streaming results.
- Since the series converges for a > 1, the partial sums should approach a limit, helping us infer its value.

This will assist in forming a conjecture on the sum's value corresponding to each parameter.

```python
# Enumerate partial sums of the series sum_{i=0}^∞ (a * i) / (a^i) for a > 1
# For sample values of a, compute and stream partial sums

def partial_sum(a, terms=100):
    sum_val = 0.0
    for i in range(terms):
        term = (a * i) / (a ** i)
        sum_val += term
        print(f"a={a:.2f}, term_{i}={term:.4f}, partial_sum={sum_val:.4f}")
    return sum_val

sample_values = [1.5, 2.0, 3.0]
for a in sample_values:
    print(f"\nPartial sums for a={a}:")
    partial_sum(a, terms=50)
```
