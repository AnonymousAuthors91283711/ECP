This problem involves summing the series \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n - k}{k} \cdot 2^k\). To assist in conjecturing the closed form, we will implement a Python script that computes this sum for small values of \(n\) and searches for a pattern.

We will:
- Enumerate all \(k\) from 0 up to \(n\).
- Calculate \( \binom{n - k}{k} \cdot 2^k \) for each \(k\).
- Sum these to get the total.
- Print each value immediately for analysis.

This approach helps detect a pattern or guess a closed form.

```python
from math import comb

def sum_series(n):
    total = 0
    for k in range(n + 1):
        term = comb(n - k, k) * (2 ** k)
        print(f"n={n}, k={k}, term={term}")  # streaming output
        total += term
    print(f"Sum for n={n} is {total}")

# Sample range to observe pattern
for n in range(0, 15):
    sum_series(n)
```

This code enumerates the terms and their sums for small values of \(n\), aiding in pattern recognition or guesswork for the closed form.
