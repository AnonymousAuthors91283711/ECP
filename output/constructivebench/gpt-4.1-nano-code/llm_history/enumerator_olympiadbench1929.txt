This problem involves finding pairs (m, n) of positive integers where the product of a specific sequence equals the factorial of m. To assist in conjecturing the true answer, I will write a Python script that:

- Enumerates small values of n and computes the product of the sequence.
- Checks if the product matches any factorial of a positive integer m.
- Prints these pairs immediately when found, prioritizing exact matches.
- Stops after testing a reasonable range (say, n from 1 to 20) to keep output manageable, since factorials grow rapidly.

This approach helps us identify patterns or specific pairs that satisfy the condition without hardcoding assumptions.

```python
import math

# Enumerate n from 1 to 20 for feasibility, larger n lead to huge products
for n in range(1, 21):
    # Compute the product of the sequence
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        term = 2 ** n - 2 ** i
        product *= term
    
    # Check if product is a factorial
    # To do this, find an m such that m! = product
    # Since factorials grow fast, we only need to check up to a certain m
    m = 1
    while True:
        fact = math.factorial(m)
        if fact == product:
            print(f"Found: m={m}, n={n}")
            break
        elif fact > product:
            break
        m += 1
```

This code will print all pairs of (m, n) up to n=20 where the product of the specified sequence equals m!. It facilitates identifying particular solutions to aid in forming and testing conjectures.
