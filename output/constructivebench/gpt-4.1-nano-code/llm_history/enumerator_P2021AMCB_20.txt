This problem involves polynomial division and specifically finding the remainder when dividing \(X^5 + X^4 + X^3 + X^2 + X + 1\) by \(X^2 - X + 1\). The task is to find the unique polynomial \(R\) of degree less than 2 (i.e., degree 1 or 0) that satisfies the division, and show that this \(R\) is uniquely characterized by the conditions.

To approach this, I will compute the polynomial division explicitly by trying candidate remainders of degree less than 2, i.e., constant or linear polynomials, and verify which correctly reproduce the division.

Since the coefficients are integers, I will test possible values for \(R\), in particular considering that \(R = aX + b\) where \(a, b\) are integers within a reasonable small range. I'll focus on small integer coefficients like -3 to 3 for quick testing, as larger coefficients are unlikely to be the remainder in such a division, and this covers the typical range.

I'll implement an efficient enumeration: for each candidate \(a, b\), compute \(Q = \frac{f - R}{g}\) with \(f = X^5 + X^4 + X^3 + X^2 + X + 1\) and \(g = X^2 - X + 1\). Check if the division results in a polynomial with integer coefficients with no remainder; if found, print the remainder \(R\).

```python
# Program to find the unique remainder R (degree < 2) in dividing f by g
# f = X^5 + X^4 + X^3 + X^2 + X + 1
# g = X^2 - X + 1
from sympy import symbols, Poly, div

X = symbols('X')
f = Poly(X**5 + X**4 + X**3 + X**2 + X + 1, X)
g = Poly(X**2 - X + 1, X)

# Enumerate possible remainders R: of form a*X + b with small integer coefficients
for a in range(-3, 4):
    for b in range(-3, 4):
        R = Poly(a*X + b, X)
        # Compute dividend minus remainder
        numerator = f - R
        # Divide numerator by g
        q, rem = div(numerator, g)
        # Check if division resulted in zero remainder
        if rem.as_expr() == 0:
            # Full division is exact
            Q_coeffs = q.all_coeffs()
            # Ensure quotient coefficients are all integers
            if all(coef.is_integer for coef in Q_coeffs):
                print(f"Candidate R: {R.as_expr()}")
```
