The proposed answer includes approximations using `≈` which are not directly supported in Lean's set definitions, leading to the syntax errors. Since the enumeration suggests explicit approximate points within specific intervals, and the goal is a closed-form description, it's natural to describe the set in terms of intervals and specific floor values, rather than approximate points.

From the enumeration:
- For `⌊x⌋ = 1`, the points are near 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, and 1.999, all within `[1, 2)`. The exact characterization would include the entire interval `[1, 2)` where the formula holds, possibly excluding some boundary points where the formula might change (due to discontinuities). The same applies for `⌊x⌋=2` near 2.25 within `[2,3)`.

Given the formula:
`⌊x² - 2x⌋ + 2 ⌊x⌋ = ⌊x⌋²`

and the observed points, the set appears to be the union of the two intervals:
- `[1, 2)` with `⌊x⌋ = 1`.
- `[2, 3)` with `⌊x⌋ = 2`.

The formula's validity probably depends on the quadratic behavior, which is continuous within these intervals, so the set possibly contains all points in these intervals satisfying the formula.

Therefore, a simple closed-form definition is:

```lean
{ x : ℝ | (x ∈ Ico 1 2) ∧ ⌊x⌋ = 1 } ∪ { x : ℝ | (x ∈ Ico 2 3) ∧ ⌊x⌋ = 2 }
```

which matches the enumeration and avoids approximations or unsupported syntax.

Final answer:

<<<{x : ℝ | (x ∈ Ico 1 2) ∧ (⌊x⌋ = 1)} ∪ {x : ℝ | (x ∈ Ico 2 3) ∧ (⌊x⌋ = 2)}>>>
