The code provided is in Lean theorem prover syntax, not Python. To assist in concrete enumeration for a combinatorial or number theory problem (such as finding values satisfying certain constraints), we need specific details about the problem itself (e.g., what `P2020AMCB_6_answer` is supposed to represent). Since the prompt doesn't specify the exact problem, I'll assume a typical type of problem — for example, enumerating integers n ≥ 9 that satisfy some property, like being divisible by a certain number, having certain factors, or following a pattern.

Given the structure:

- The function is for all `n ≥ 9`.
- The answer involves some property.

I'll write a Python enumeration that:

- Prints candidate values of `n` starting from 9.
- Checks a hypothetical property (like `n % 3 == 0`), since the true property is unspecified.
- Streams answers immediately.
- Limits to a certain range (e.g., up to 50) for demonstration.

You can replace the condition with the actual property once known.

```python
# Example enumeration for n >= 9 up to a certain limit, checking an example property,
# e.g., n divisible by 3
for n in range(9, 51):
    if n % 3 == 0:
        print(n)
```

This code outputs all candidates `n ≥ 9` divisible by 3 up to 50, streaming each answer immediately as it is found. Adjust the condition accordingly to match the specific property in the original problem.
