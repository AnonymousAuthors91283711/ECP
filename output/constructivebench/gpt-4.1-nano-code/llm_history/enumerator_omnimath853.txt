This problem seems to be exploring the minimal size of a family of nonempty subsets on a finite set of size 2021, such that the product over each subset's elements forms an injective function, with the elements chosen to be pairwise coprime whenever the indices differ.

To assist the conjecture, I will:
- Fix small sample functions `x` with pairwise coprime values.
- Enumerate all possible nonempty subsets of the set of size 2021.
- Check which collections of subsets satisfy the injectivity condition for the products.
- Keep track of the minimal `k` (cardinality of the collection).

Since direct heavy computation over all subsets would be infeasible, I'll restrict enumeration to small subset sizes and look for patterns or minimal examples.

```python
import itertools
from math import gcd

# Parameters
n = 10  # Small number to simulate the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}
max_subset_size = 3  # Limit subset sizes for feasibility

# Generate a set of pairwise coprime values
# For simplicity, assign each element a prime number
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
x_values = {i: primes[i] for i in range(n)}

# Store minimal collection size found
min_size = None
min_collections = []

# Generate all nonempty subsets up to size max_subset_size
all_subsets = []
for size in range(1, max_subset_size + 1):
    all_subsets.extend(itertools.combinations(range(n), size))

# For each possible collection of subsets, check injectivity of product function
for r in range(1, 21):  # limit to collections of size up to 20
    for S in itertools.combinations(all_subsets, r):
        # Ensure all subsets are nonempty (already guaranteed)
        # Check injectivity: distinct subsets should produce distinct products
        seen_products = set()
        injective = True
        for s in S:
            prod = 1
            for i in s:
                prod *= x_values[i]
            if prod in seen_products:
                injective = False
                break
            seen_products.add(prod)
        if injective:
            k = len(S)
            print(f"Found collection with size {k}: {S}")
            if min_size is None or k < min_size:
                min_size = k
                min_collections = [S]
            elif k == min_size:
                min_collections.append(S)

# Output the minimal size found
print(f"Minimal collection size: {min_size}")
```
