theorem omnimath3107 : 
  ∀ x : ℝ, 4 * x + 14 = 8 * x - 48 → 2 * x = omnimath3107_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 31.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The equation simplifies to 4x + 14 = 8x - 48. Rearranged: 14 + 48 = 8x - 4x, yielding 62 = 4x, so x = 62 / 4 = 31. The answer generalizes as x = 31. 

Answer in Lean:
<<<(31 : ℝ)>>>
