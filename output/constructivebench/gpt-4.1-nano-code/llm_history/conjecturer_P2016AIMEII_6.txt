theorem P2016AIMEII_6 :
  let P : ℚ[X] := C 1 - C (1/3) * X + C (1/6) * X^2
  let Q := P * (P.comp (X^3)) * (P.comp (X^5)) * (P.comp (X^7)) * (P.comp (X^9))
  let a := fun i => Q.coeff i
  (∑ i ∈ Finset.range 51, |a i|) = P2016AIMEII_6_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Approximate sum of |coefficients| up to degree 50: 4.2140. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests scaling the approximate sum by 1000 and rounding to an integer to convert to ℕ. Based on the numerical approximation 4.214, multiplying by 1000 yields 4214, which should match the sum provided. 

<<<4214>>>
