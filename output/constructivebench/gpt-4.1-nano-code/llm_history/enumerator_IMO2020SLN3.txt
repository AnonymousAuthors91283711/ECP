This task involves enumerating sequences to analyze a problem potentially related to a combinatorial or number theory puzzle. Although the exact problem statement isn't fully provided, the structure suggests checking sequences of natural numbers (`a : Fin n → ℕ`) for a certain property related to averages and squares, with constraints on the sequence being non-constant.

Given the problem's nature, the key step is to generate candidate sequences of length `n`, and for each, determine if the stated property holds or fails.

**Approach:**
- Select small values for `n` (since large `n` would be infeasible).
- For each sequence of size `n` with elements in a manageable range (e.g., 0 to 3), check the condition:
  - If the sequence is not constant (`¬∀ i j, a i = a j`),
  - Then verify that the property involving averages and squares does not hold.
- Output sequences where the property fails and those where it holds to assist in conjecturing.

Below is a Python program implementing this enumeration.

```python
# Program to enumerate small sequences for the problem involving averages and squares.
# Since the sequences are small, we restrict to elements 0..3 for feasibility.
from itertools import product

def property_holds(seq):
    n = len(seq)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            a_i, a_j = seq[i], seq[j]
            if (a_i + a_j) % 2 != 0:
                continue  # skip if average isn't integer
            mid = (a_i + a_j) // 2
            for k in range(n):
                if seq[k] == mid:
                    # Check for some l where seq[l] == seq[k]^2
                    for l in range(n):
                        if seq[l] == seq[k] ** 2:
                            return True
    return False

def enumerate_sequences(n, max_element=3):
    # Generate all sequences with elements from 0..max_element
    for seq in product(range(max_element+1), repeat=n):
        yield seq

# Choose small n for feasible enumeration
n = 3
print(f"Enumerating sequences of length {n} with elements in 0..{3}")

for seq in enumerate_sequences(n):
    if not all_equal(seq):
        if property_holds(seq):
            print(f"Sequence where property holds: {seq}")
        else:
            print(f"Sequence where property fails: {seq}")

def all_equal(seq):
    return all(x == seq[0] for x in seq)
```
