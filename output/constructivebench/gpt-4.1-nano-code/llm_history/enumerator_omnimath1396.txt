The problem appears to be a theorem about a certain maximum value `f` related to functions on a finite set, their sums, and relations to 1/2. Based on the context, the question seeks the greatest such `f` satisfying the condition for all functions `a : Fin n → ℝ`. We can interpret the problem as: 

What is the largest `f` such that for *any* real-valued function `a` on `n` points, with total sum an integer, there exists a point `i` where `|a i - 1/2| ≥ f`?

Intuitively, the proof involves constructing functions `a` that "spread out" or "balance" around 1/2, ensuring that the minimal deviation at some point is maximized.

**Key insight**:  
- The total sum is an integer, so consider functions with total sum exactly `m`.  
- To maximize the minimal `|a i - 1/2|`, equality occurs when $a_i$ are as close as possible to 1/2 but still satisfy the sum condition.  
- The worst case occurs when the values are balanced as evenly as possible around 1/2.

By exploring particular functions, especially symmetric ones, and considering the total sum constraints, the extremal deviation occurs when the values are split into two groups: some points with values near `1/2 + f` and some near `1/2 - f`, so that the total sum satisfies the integer sum condition.

For simplicity, testing small values like `n=2` or `n=3`, and examining symmetric functions, indicates the maximal `f` is `1/2` when `n=1`, but for larger `n`, the value shrinks proportionally.

In particular, as `n` grows, the maximum `f` should be approximately `1/2`. But since the total sum is an integer, and the sum of each `a i` must be integer, the precise maximum `f` for given `n` is `(1/2)`, when values are split evenly.

**Implementation**:  
- For small `n`, test candidate functions with values at `(1/2 - f)` and `(1/2 + f)`  
- Adjust `f` to find the maximum where the sum is still an integer.

Below is a Python script that heuristically explores candidate `f` values and identifies the maximum confirmed value satisfying the constraints, streaming each found answer.

```python
import math

# We choose small n for demonstration
n = 3  # sample n (small)
max_f = 0.0
precision = 1e-4

# Iterate over candidate f values from 0 to 0.5
f = 0.0
while f <= 0.5 + precision:
    # For symmetric case: assign half of points to a_i = 0.5 + f/2,
    # and rest to 0.5 - f/2, total sum should be integer
    high = math.ceil(n / 2)
    low = n - high
    
    # Sum when assigning high points to 0.5 + f/2, low points to 0.5 - f/2
    sum_value = high * (0.5 + f/2) + low * (0.5 - f/2)
    
    if abs(sum_value - round(sum_value)) < 1e-8:
        # Sum is approximately integer, candidate f is valid
        max_f = f
        print(f"f = {f:.4f} is a candidate with sum ~ {sum_value:.4f}")
    f += 1e-3  # small step for precision

print(f"Approximate maximum f: {max_f:.4f}")
```
