This problem is about analyzing functions c : ℤ → Bool with a property P, which states that c is 7-periodic and does not have a specific pattern involving consecutive equality at some point k, satisfying additional conditions.

We need to find the number of such functions c that satisfy these conditions.

Key observations:
- Since c is 7-periodic, c(n) depends only on n mod 7.
- The condition ≠ ∃ k, c k = c (k + 1) ∧ c (2k) = c k means:
  - For no k, do we have c(k) = c(k+1) and c(2k) = c(k) simultaneously.
- The problem reduces to choosing values for c on [0..6] with the 7-periodicity, then checking the pattern.

Approach:
- For each possible pattern of 7 bits (each representing c mod i), check if the pattern contains the forbidden configuration.
- Count patterns that satisfy the restriction.

Let's implement this systematically.

```python
# The problem reduces to counting 7-bit patterns where:
# - Each pattern corresponds to c mod i for i in 0..6
# - The pattern does not contain a k such that c(k)=c(k+1) and c(2k)=c(k)

def check_pattern(pattern):
    # pattern is a list of 7 bits corresponding to c(n) = pattern[n mod 7]
    for k in range(1, 100):  # arbitrary limit, pattern extends infinitely
        c_k = pattern[k % 7]
        c_k1 = pattern[(k + 1) % 7]
        c_2k = pattern[(2 * k) % 7]
        if c_k == c_k1 and c_k == c_2k:
            return False
    return True

count = 0
# Enumerate all 2^7 = 128 patterns
for bits in range(1 << 7):
    pattern = [(bits >> i) & 1 for i in range(7)]
    if check_pattern(pattern):
        count += 1
        # Output each valid pattern as a candidate solution
        print("Pattern (c mod 7):", pattern)

print("Total count of valid patterns:", count)
```
