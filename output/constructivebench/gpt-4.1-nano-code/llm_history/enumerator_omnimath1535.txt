[write_program]
This problem involves summing a double series with terms involving the count of prime factors. To assist in conjecturing the true answer, I'll write a Python program to estimate the double sum:

- Enumerate `n` and `k` over a finite range.
- For each `(n, k)`, compute the number of prime factors of `n+1` (via a small helper).
- Sum the series with the given formula, treating `(Ω(n+1,k+1))` as a count.
- Print partial sums immediately as they are computed.
- Use small ranges to keep computations efficient and under token limits.
- Since the task overflows tokens if over 400, I'll limit ranges to small values like `n, k ∈ [0, 10]`.

```python
import math

def prime_factors_list(n):
    """Return the list of prime factors of n."""
    factors = []
    # Handle 2 separately for efficiency
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    # Check odd factors
    f = 3
    while f * f <= n:
        while n % f == 0:
            factors.append(f)
            n //= f
        f += 2
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors

def Ω(n, k):
    """Count the number of prime factors of n, considering only if p >= k."""
    count = 0
    for p in prime_factors_list(n):
        if p >= k:
            count += 1
    return count

# Parameters for enumeration
max_n = 10
max_k = 10

total_sum = 0.0
print("Starting summation over n, k up to", max_n, max_k)
for n in range(max_n + 1):
    for k in range(max_k + 1):
        value = Ω(n + 1, k + 1) / (3 ** (n + k - 6))
        total_sum += value
        print(f"n={n}, k={k}, Ω={Ω(n+1, k+1)}, term={value:.4f}, partial sum={total_sum:.4f}")
print("Estimated sum over small ranges:", total_sum)
```
