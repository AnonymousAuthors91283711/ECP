The problem involves finding a polynomial \( P \) of degree 5 over \(\mathbb{C}\) satisfying specific conditions:
- \( P \) has degree 5.
- For any \( z \in \mathbb{C} \), if \( z^5 + 2004z = 1 \), then \( P(\, z^2) = 0 \).
- The ratio \( P(1) / P(-1) \) yields a certain answer.

From the condition \( z^5 + 2004z = 1 \), solutions \( z \) satisfy \( z^5 = 1 - 2004z \). Notice that for each such \( z \), \( z \) is a root of \( Z^5 + 2004Z - 1 = 0 \).

The roots \( z \) of this polynomial are related to the roots of the polynomial \( Z^5 + 2004Z - 1 \). The 10 roots of this polynomial (some possibly complex) are the solutions \( z \). Their squares \( z^2 \) are roots of a related polynomial, likely \( P \).

The key is that all such \( z^2 \) are roots of \( P \). Since this condition holds for all solutions \( z \), the roots \( z^2 \) of \( P \) are precisely the set of squares of roots satisfying the original relation.

Given the polynomial \( Z^5 + 2004Z - 1 = 0 \), its solutions \( z \) can be approximated numerically. But \( z \) satisfy a relation involving complex rootsâ€”so a straightforward algebraic approach is complicated; however, the problem is designed for an enumeration with sample parameters.

Here, the key insight: the roots of \( Z^5 + 2004Z - 1 \) can be approximated, and their squares can be calculated to find roots of \( P \). Ultimately, the ratio involves evaluating \( P(1) \) and \( P(-1) \).

To proceed, we'll:
- Sample the roots \( z \) of \( Z^5 + 2004Z - 1 \) (approximate numerically).
- Compute \( z^2 \) for each.
- Find the minimal polynomial \( P \) with these roots (probably a degree 5 polynomial with roots \( z_i^2 \)).

Since the exact roots are complex and the problem is for enumeration, we can approximate these roots numerically.

Here's the simplified enumeration approach:
- Use numerical approximations of roots \( z \).
- Compute \( z^2 \).
- Form the polynomial with roots \( z^2 \):
  
  \( P(x) = \prod (x - z_i^2) \).

- Evaluate \( P(1) \), \( P(-1) \), and the ratio.

This way, we will stream the candidate answers for the ratio.

```python
import numpy as np

# Polynomial coefficients for Z^5 + 2004Z - 1
coeffs = [1, 0, 0, 0, 2004, -1]

# Approximate roots of Z^5 + 2004Z - 1 = 0
roots = np.roots(coeffs)

# Compute squares of roots
squared_roots = roots**2

# Construct polynomial with roots squared_roots via Vieta's formulas
# We'll use numpy's poly to get coefficients from roots
P_coeffs = np.poly(squared_roots)

# Evaluate P(1) and P(-1)
P_at_1 = np.polyval(P_coeffs, 1)
P_at_neg1 = np.polyval(P_coeffs, -1)

# Avoid division by zero
if P_at_neg1 != 0:
    ratio = P_at_1 / P_at_neg1
else:
    ratio = np.inf

print("Roots Z^5 + 2004Z - 1 approximations:", roots)
print("Squared roots for roots of P:", squared_roots)
print("Polynomial coefficients of P (degree 5):", P_coeffs)
print("P(1):", P_at_1)
print("P(-1):", P_at_neg1)
print("Ratio P(1)/P(-1):", ratio)
