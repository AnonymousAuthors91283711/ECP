The problem appears to involve finding the minimal sum \(s = a + b + c\) of three distinct positive integers \(a, b, c\) satisfying the equation \(a^b \cdot b^c = a^c\), with \(a, b, c\) all distinct and positive. We want to identify all candidate triples, search for solutions systematically, and determine the least such sum \(s\).

To do this efficiently:
- Fix small values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), within a manageable range.
- Check the given equation for each triplet.
- Only consider triplets with distinct positive integers.
- Track the minimal sum.

Here's an enumeration over small values, printing feasible solutions as they are found, and finally identifying the minimal sum.

```python
# Enumeration of small positive triples (a, b, c), with distinct values,
# to find those satisfying a^b * b^c = a^c, and track minimal sum s = a + b + c.

solutions = []
max_val = 20  # limit for small enumeration

for a in range(1, max_val + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_val + 1):
        for c in range(1, max_val + 1):
            if len({a, b, c}) != 3:
                continue  # ensure all are distinct
            # Compute lhs and rhs to check the equation
            lhs = a**b * b**c
            rhs = a**c
            if lhs == rhs:
                s = a + b + c
                print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, sum={s}")
                solutions.append(s)

if solutions:
    min_sum = min(solutions)
    print(f"Minimum sum among solutions: {min_sum}")
else:
    print("No solutions found within given bounds.")
```
