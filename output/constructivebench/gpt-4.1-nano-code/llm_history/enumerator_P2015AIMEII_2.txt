This problem involves calculating the probability that a randomly selected Latin student (from freshmen, sophomores, juniors, seniors) is a sophomore, and expressing that probability as a simplified fraction. The approach involves:

- Assigning the counts to each class based on total students.
- Calculating the Latin students in each class.
- Computing the probability (Latin sophomores over total Latin students).
- Simplifying the probability to lowest terms as a fraction.
- Noting that the fraction's numerator and denominator are coprime.
- Finding the sum of numerator and denominator as part of the answer.

The calculations can be done precisely with rational arithmetic in Python, then output the simplified fraction and sum.

Here's the implementation:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Total students
total = 100

# Counts for each class
freshmen = 0.4 * total
sophomores = 0.3 * total
juniors = 0.2 * total
seniors = 0.1 * total

# Latin students in each class
latin_freshmen = 1.0 * freshmen
latin_sophomores = 0.8 * sophomores
latin_juniors = 0.5 * juniors
latin_seniors = 0.2 * seniors

# Total Latin students
total_latin = latin_freshmen + latin_sophomores + latin_juniors + latin_seniors

# Probability that a Latin student is a sophomore
prob = latin_sophomores / total_latin

# Convert to a fraction and simplify
frac = Fraction(prob).limit_denominator()

m = frac.numerator
n = frac.denominator

print(f"Numerator: {m}")
print(f"Denominator: {n}")
print(f"Fraction: {m}/{n}")
print(f"Sum of numerator and denominator: {m + n}")
```

This code precisely computes the simplified fraction for the probability and outputs the sum of numerator and denominator, which forms the answer for the problem.
