The problem involves two positive integers \(x\) and \(y\), with conditions linking their multiples to a cube and divisibility constraints. The key points are:

- \(x > 0\) and \(1584 \times x = k^3\) for some integer \(k\), which must be minimal with respect to \(x\).
- For a given \(x\), \(x\) divides \(x y\), and among all positive \(y'\) such that \(1584 \times x\) divides \(x y'\), the minimal such \(y\) is being sought.

To analyze the problem, the main challenge is to understand the structure of \(x\). Since \(1584 \times x = k^3\), \(x\) must fill in to make the product a perfect cube, by dividing out the factors of 1584 appropriately.

The factorization of 1584 is:
\[ 1584 = 2^4 \times 3^1 \times 11^1 \]

For \(1584 \times x\) to be a perfect cube:

- The exponents in the prime factorization of \(1584 \times x\) must be multiples of 3.
- Since \(1584 = 2^4 \times 3^1 \times 11^1\),
- To make \(1584 \times x\) a perfect cube, \(x\) must contribute to bring exponents of 2, 3, and 11 to the next multiple of 3.

Thus, the minimal \(x\) for that is:

- \(x\) includes \(2^{(3 - 4 \bmod 3) \bmod 3} = 2^{(3 - 1) \bmod 3} = 2^2\),
- \(3^{(3 - 1) \bmod 3} = 3^2\),
- \(11^{(3 - 1) \bmod 3} = 11^2\).

So minimal \(x\) is:

\[ x = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 11^2 = 4 \times 9 \times 121 = 4 \times 1089 = 4356 \]

Calculate \(k\):
\[ 1584 \times 4356 = k^3 \]
Check:

\[ 1584 \times 4356 = ? \]
equals to:

\[ 2^4 \times 3^1 \times 11^1 \times 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 11^2 = 2^{6} \times 3^{3} \times 11^{3} \]
which simplifies to:
\[ (2^{2} \times 3^{1} \times 11^{1})^3 \]
Hence,
\[ k = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 11^1 = 4 \times 3 \times 11 = 132 \]

Thus \(k = 132\).

The minimal \(x=4356\), \(k=132\).

With this, the minimal \(y\) such that \(1584 \times x\) divides \(x y\) and minimizes \(y\) is:

\[ y = \frac{x y}{x} \ge y \]
but since \(1584 \times x\) divides \(x y\), then:

\[ x y \equiv 0 \mod 1584 x \]
which simplifies to:

\[ y \text{ must be divisible by } 1584. \]

Because \(x\) cancels from numerator and denominator, the minimal such \(y\) is:

\[ y = 1584. \]

Now, we implement this reasoning in the code to enumerate candidate answers.

```python
# Enumerate the minimal x and corresponding y based on cube factorization constraints
def enumerate_answers():
    # Prime factorization of 1584
    prime_factors = {2: 4, 3: 1, 11: 1}
    # Compute the exponents needed to make the product a perfect cube
    exponents_needed = {}
    for p, exp in prime_factors.items():
        rem = exp % 3
        if rem != 0:
            exponents_needed[p] = 3 - rem
        else:
            exponents_needed[p] = 0
    # Construct minimal x
    x = 1
    for p, e in exponents_needed.items():
        x *= p ** e
    # Compute corresponding k
    k_exponents = {p: prime_factors.get(p, 0) + exponents_needed.get(p, 0) for p in set(prime_factors) | set(exponents_needed)}
    k = 1
    for p, e in k_exponents.items():
        k *= p ** e // 3  # Since the total exponents are multiples of 3, k's exponents are the total exponents divided by 3
    # Minimal y dividing 1584 * x is y = 1584
    y = 1584
    print("x:", x)
    print("k:", k)
    print("y:", y)
    return y
