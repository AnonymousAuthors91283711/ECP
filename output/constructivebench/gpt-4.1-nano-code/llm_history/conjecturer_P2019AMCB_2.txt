Minimum such n: 6. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sequence suggests the first such n is 6, and numbers are composite with previous number non-prime. The pattern indicates the answer is the smallest composite number n where both n and n-2 are not prime. The minimal such n is 9, but 9 is prime? No, 9 is not prime; verifying critical values in the list. The minimal n from the enumerated list satisfying the property appears to be 9, but since 9 is prime, discard. The next candidates, like 15, etc., are irrelevant as minimal. The first number is 6, which is composite and 4 is not prime. But 4 actually is not prime, 4: composite, 4-2=2: prime. So do check the sequence accordingly. The minimal candidate fitting the pattern is 9 (?), but check the enumerated list: 6, 8, 10, etc. All are composite? 6: composite, 6-2=4: composite, 8: composite, 8-2=6, also composite. So minimal candidate is 6, with 4 also composite, and both non-prime. Compose answer accordingly.

Answer: 

<<<6>>>
