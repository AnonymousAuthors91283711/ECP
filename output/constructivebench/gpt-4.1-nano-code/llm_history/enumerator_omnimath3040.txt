This problem involves finding three distinct digits \( P, Q, R \) (each less than 10) such that two specified three-digit sums are equal, and all three digits are pairwise distinct. Additionally, the sum of these three digits is used to define a value called `omnimath3040_answer`. To explore possible solutions, I will systematically enumerate candidate triplets \((P, Q, R)\), check the conditions, and compute their digit sum, streaming all valid results.

The core checking condition is:

\[
100P + 70 + R + 300 + 90 + R = 100R + 10Q
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
(100P + 70 + R) + (300 + 90 + R) = 100R + 10Q
\]

or

\[
(100P + R + 70) + (390 + R) = 100R + 10Q
\]

which simplifies further to:

\[
100P + R + 70 + 390 + R = 100R + 10Q
\]
\[
100P + 2R + 460 = 100R + 10Q
\]

Rearranged:

\[
100P + 460 = 100R + 10Q - 2R
\]
\[
100P + 460 = 98R + 10Q
\]

Now, for each triplet \((P, Q, R)\) with digits less than 10, we check these conditions:

- \( P, Q, R \in \{0,\ldots,9\} \)
- \( P, Q, R \) are pairwise distinct
- The equation holds

Let's implement this enumeration efficiently.

```python
# Systematically enumerate all triplets of distinct digits less than 10
# Check the condition derived from the problem
# Stream valid solutions and their digit sums

solutions = []

for P in range(10):
    for Q in range(10):
        if Q == P:
            continue
        for R in range(10):
            if R in (P, Q):
                continue
            # Check the main equation: 100P + 460 = 98R + 10Q
            lhs = 100 * P + 460
            rhs = 98 * R + 10 * Q
            if lhs == rhs:
                digit_sum = P + Q + R
                print(digit_sum)
                solutions.append(digit_sum)
```
