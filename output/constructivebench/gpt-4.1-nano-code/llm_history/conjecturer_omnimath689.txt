Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<150>>>
The enumerated solutions follow the pattern \(a = 12k + r\) with \(r \in \{3, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, 45, 52, 59, 66, 73, 80, 87, 94, 101, 108, 115, 122, 129, 136, 143\}\). The minimal \(a\) in the set is 3; the maximum is 150. The answer set appears to be bounded between 3 and 150 in this pattern, with positive integer \(a\). Thus, the final answer is the maximum \(a\), i.e., \(a = 150\).
