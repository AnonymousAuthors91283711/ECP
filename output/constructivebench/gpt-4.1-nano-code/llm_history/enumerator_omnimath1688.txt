The problem involves analyzing the iterated function g = f^{(2009)}(x), where f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1. Note that f(x) can be written as (x + 1)^2. Iterating this function 2009 times starting from x yields g(x) = (x + 1)^{2^{2009}} based on the pattern of repeated squaring. The theorem suggests expressing g(x) as a polynomial in x with certain coefficients a(i), notably that the leading coefficient a(2^{2009} - 1) equals some value.

To assist, we write a Python program that:
- Enumerates possible coefficients for the polynomial expansion of (x + 1)^{2^{2009}}.
- Uses binomial expansion properties to verify the coefficients.
- Since 2^{2009} is large, we will choose small sample parameters for demonstration.
- Focuses on the coefficients and the sum expression as per the theorem.

Here's a concise Python code to generate the binomial coefficients of expansions and verify the structure:

```python
from math import comb

# For small sample, choose n = 4 to illustrate (since 2^{2009} is enormous)
n = 4
x = 0  # x can be set to 0 to analyze coefficients

# Generate coefficients of (x + 1)^n
coeffs = [comb(n, i) for i in range(n + 1)]

# g(x) = (x + 1)^n, hence coefficients are known
# The sum in the theorem corresponds to sum of a_i * x^i
# Since in binomial expansion, a_i = C(n, i)

# Print out the coefficients and the sum
print("Coefficients a_i for (x + 1)^{}: {}".format(n, coeffs))
print("Polynomial g(x) = sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i * x^i, with a_i = C({}, i)".format(n, n))
print("Sum over i of a_i * x^i matches the expansion:")
for i in range(n + 1):
    print("a_{} * x^{} = {} * x^{}".format(i, i, coeffs[i], i))
```

This script:
- Uses small n=4 to demonstrate, aligning with the polynomial expansion.
- Prints out the coefficients a_i explicitly, supporting the conjecture about the polynomial form.
- Serves as a model for larger n, e.g., 2^{2009}, where the coefficients are binomial coefficients C(2^{2009}, i).

This helps inform the structure of g(x), confirming that the coefficients match the binomial expansion, and that the highest coefficient (for i=2^{2009}-1) equals C(2^{2009}, 2^{2009}-1) = 2^{2009}.
