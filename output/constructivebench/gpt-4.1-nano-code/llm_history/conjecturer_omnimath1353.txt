The symmetry condition (p ∘ q).eval x = (q ∘ p).eval x for all x suggests p and q commute under composition, which constrains their forms. Both polynomials are degree 3 with specified evaluations at 0, and their composition equality implies a specific relation between their coefficients. Given the symmetry and the evaluations, the most consistent solution aligns with p(x) = -24 + a x^3 and q(x) = 30 + c x^3, where the highest-degree terms must satisfy commutation constraints, leading to a fixed pair of evaluations at specific points.  
Based on the pattern, the resulting pair appears to be:  
\(\boxed{(0, 78)}\). 

Final answer:  
<<<(0, 78)>>>
