Term 20: a_20.0000, sin(a_20) = 0.9751, product = 0.1280. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern, as \(n\) increases, \(\sin(a_n)\) approaches 1, and the product decreases toward 1/100. The sequence of products appears to tend to 0.01. The pattern suggests the infinite product converges to \(1/100\).
