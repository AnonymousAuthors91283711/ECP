This problem involves finding two distinct integers \( x, y \in [1, 37] \) such that the sum of all integers in \([1, 37]\) except \( x \) and \( y \) equals \( x \times y \), and also that \( y - x \) equals some value to be determined. We want to enumerate all such solutions and focus on the value \( y - x \).

To do so efficiently:
- Generate all pairs \( (x, y) \) with \( 1 \leq x < y \leq 37 \).
- For each pair, compute the sum of [1..37] minus \( x \) and \( y \).
- Check if this equals \( x \times y \).
- If yes, print the pair and the difference \( y - x \).

The total sum of integers from 1 to 37 is \(\frac{37 \times 38}{2} = 703\). For each pair, sum (excluding \( x, y \)) is \( 703 - x - y \). We look for pairs where \( 703 - x - y = x \times y \). For every such pair, print the difference \( y - x \).

```python
# Enumerate pairs (x, y) with 1 <= x < y <= 37 for the condition:
# sum of all numbers except x, y (which is 703 - x - y) equals x * y
# and compute y - x for each solution.
# Print each found solution as soon as it is identified.

total_sum = 703  # sum of numbers from 1 to 37

for x in range(1, 37):
    for y in range(x + 1, 38):
        sum_excluding_x_y = total_sum - x - y
        if sum_excluding_x_y == x * y:
            difference = y - x
            print(difference)
```
