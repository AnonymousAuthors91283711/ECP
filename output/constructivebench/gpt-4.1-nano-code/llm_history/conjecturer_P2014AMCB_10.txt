    (1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 9) ∧
    (0 ≤ b ∧ b ≤ 9) ∧
    (0 ≤ c ∧ c ≤ 9) ∧
    a + b + c ≤ 7 ∧
    (∃ (t : ℕ), 0 < t ∧ 100*a + 10*b + c + 55*t = 100*c + 10*b + a) ∧
    a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = P2014AMCB_10_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 37. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the solution involves the relation between the digits a, b, c and the value 100a + 10b + c. Rewriting the key equation:

100a + 10b + c + 55t = 100c + 10b + a,

which simplifies to:

99a + c + 55t = 100c + a,

or,

98a + 55t = 99c.

Considering the bounds and the nature of the problem, the minimal sum of squares S = a² + b² + c² is minimized when a, c are as close as possible under the constraints, with t<sub>1</sub> being a positive integer satisfying the relation.

Given the enumeration, the minimal sum of squares matching the constraints (a ∈ [1..9], b, c ∈ [0..9]) and the equation appears to be 37. So the sum of squares is consistently 37.
