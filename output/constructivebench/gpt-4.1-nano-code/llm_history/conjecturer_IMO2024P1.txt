noncomputable abbrev IMO2024P1_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem IMO2024P1 (α : ℝ) :
  (∀ n : ℕ, 0 < n → (n : ℤ) ∣ (∑ i in Finset.range n, ⌊(i + 1) * α⌋)) ↔ α ∈ IMO2024P1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found potential solution α = 2.000
Found potential solution α = 4.000. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The pattern indicates solutions are multiples of 2, specifically α = 2 or 4. For generality, these are 2 times an integer. Thus, the set includes all α such that α = 2 * k for some k ∈ ℤ.
