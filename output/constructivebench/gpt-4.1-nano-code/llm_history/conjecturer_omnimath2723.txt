<<<a + 6 + 6 + 6>>>, which simplifies to  arrest b = a + 6 and c = b + 6, so d = c + 6 = (a + 6 + 6) + 6 = a + 18. Since a + b + c + d = 120, substituting gives a + (a+6) + (a+12) + (a+18) = 120. Simplify to 4a + 36 = 120 → 4a = 84 → a = 21. Then, d = a + 18 = 21 + 18 = 39. So, the answer is 39. >>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

. Current Proposed Answer: a + 6 + 6 + 6. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 34, which is at "a + 6 + 6 + 6" in "abbrev omnimath2723_answer : ℕ := a + 6 + 6 + 6", there is an error: unknown identifier 'a'.
. Enumerated Answers: d = 39. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem describes a sum of variables a, b, c, d, with specific relations: b = a + 6, c = b + 6, d = c + 6, and a total sum of 120. By substituting b, c, and d in terms of a, we see that d = a + 18. The equation becomes: a + (a + 6) + (a + 12) + (a + 18) = 120. Simplifying, this yields 4a + 36 = 120, so 4a = 84, which gives a = 21. Therefore, d = a + 18 = 39, confirming the enumerated answer.

In Lean, the abbreviation should be a constant value, not an expression involving an unknown variable like 'a'. Since 'a' is specifically 21, the answer is known. The fix is to replace the undefined 'a' with its calculated value, 21, leading to the answer 39.

Thus, the correct expression for omnimath2723_answer is 39.

. Enumerated Answers: d = 39. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The current proposed answer `fun _ => 39` is a function type, which causes a type mismatch because `abbrev omnimath2723_answer : ℕ :=` expects a `ℕ`, not a function. Since the enumerated answer is `d = 39`, the correct answer should directly be the number `39`. 

Given the problem constraints, where `a, b, c, d : ℕ` and the relations `b = a + 6`, `c = b + 6`, `d = c + 6`, and the sum `a + b + c + d = 120`, we can verify the sequence:
- Sum of the four terms:
  - `a + (a + 6) + (a + 12) + (a + 18) = 4a + 36`
- Equating to 120:
  - `4a + 36 = 120` → `4a = 84` → `a = 21`
- Then:
  - `b = 27`
  - `c = 33`
  - `d = 39`
- The answer matches the enumerated answer `39`.

Thus, the correct fix is to directly assign `39`.
