: a + b = mathodyssey18_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: a=17, b=64, m=42, n=59
a=17, b=64, m=-42, n=59
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The values satisfy 100a + b = m^2 and 201a + b = n^2. Subtracting gives (201a + b) - (100a + b) = n^2 - m^2 → 101a = (n - m)(n + m). Since a is a two-digit number, 17 ≤ a ≤ 99, and m, n are integers, the plausible factorization leads to n + m = 59, n - m = 42, resulting in a = 17. Correspondingly, b = 64 from the equations. Final answer: <<<17>>>.
