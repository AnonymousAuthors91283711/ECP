Average image cardinality: 1.0
n = 2: total sum of image cardinalities = 6
Total functions: 4
Average image cardinality: 1.5
n = 3: total sum of image cardinalities = 57
Total functions: 27
Average image cardinality: 2.111111111111111
n = 4: total sum of image cardinalities = 700
Total functions: 256
Average image cardinality: 2.734375
n = 5: total sum of image cardinalities = 10505
Total functions: 3125
Average image cardinality: 3.3616. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℚ
The pattern suggests the total sum of image cardinalities for each n is n^n * (1 - 1/n). Hence, the average sum is (n^n * (1 - 1/n)) / n^n = 1 - 1/n. 

Final answer: <<<fun n : ℕ => 1 - 1 / n>>>
