The problem asks for the least t > 0 such that there exists a function x : Fin t → ℤ with sum of cubes equal to 2002^{2002}. Since 2002^{2002} is a perfect cube, choosing t=1 with x(0)=2002^{2002} satisfies the condition. No smaller t works because sum of zero cubes is zero, which is not equal to 2002^{2002}. Thus, the minimal t is 1.
