noncomputable abbrev P2018AMCB_7_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2018AMCB_7 : 3 * Real.logb 7 23 = P2018AMCB_7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Approximate value of 3 * log_b 7 23: 4.833975840227794
ln 7: 1.9459101490553132
ln 23: 3.1354942159291497
log_b 7 23: 1.6113252800759312. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the approximate value (around 4.834) and the calculated logarithm (log_b 7 23 ≈ 1.611), the exact answer is likely the product 3 × log_b 7 23. Using the properties of logarithms, the exact form is 3 times the logarithm base b of 7 and 23, giving an expression involving natural logs: 3 * (ln 23 / ln 7). 

Therefore, the exact closed-form answer is:

<<<3 * (Real.log 23 / Real.log 7)>>>
