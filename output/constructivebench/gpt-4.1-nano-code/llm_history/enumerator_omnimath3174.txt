This problem appears to examine the difference of factorials `(b! - a!)` modulo 10 for natural numbers `a` and `b` with `0 < a < b`. The task is to find possible answers to a certain modulo condition, but the code provided uses placeholders and symbolism from the Lean theorem prover (e.g., `theorem`, `abbrev`, `sorry`, `open Nat`).

Since the goal is to enumerate possible answers to the difference `(b! - a!) % 10` under the constraints `0 < a < b`, I will create a Python script to systematically examine small values of `a` and `b` and compute `(b! - a!) % 10`. The script will output each distinct value found, streaming results as we go, prioritizing exact calculations. We'll limit `a` and `b` to small numbers (say, up to 10), because factorials grow quickly and large values are unnecessary for small modulo 10 calculations.

Here's the approach:
- For `a` in 1 to 9
- For `b` in `a+1` to 10
- Compute `b! - a!` modulo 10
- Print each distinct value found immediately

This helps in conjecturing the possible residues of `(b! - a!) % 10` for small `a, b`.

```python
# Enumerate small values of a and b with 0 < a < b <= 10
# Compute (b! - a!) % 10 and print each distinct result
import math

found = set()
for a in range(1, 10):
    a_fact = math.factorial(a)
    for b in range(a + 1, 11):
        b_fact = math.factorial(b)
        diff_mod = (b_fact - a_fact) % 10
        if diff_mod not in found:
            print(diff_mod)
            found.add(diff_mod)
```
