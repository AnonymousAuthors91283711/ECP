The problem involves two odd integers \(a\) and \(b\), with conditions:
- \(a < b\),
- \(b = 3a\),
- and \(a + b =\) the answer we seek.

Given that \(b = 3a\), and both are odd integers, then:
- Since \(a\) is odd,
- \(b = 3a\) is also odd (because 3 times odd is odd),
- And \(a + b = a + 3a = 4a\).

So, the answer simplifies to \(4a\) for some odd \(a\).

To satisfy \(a < b = 3a\), with both odd and \(a\) odd, and the sum \(a + b = 4a\), which depends solely on \(a\), we can generate 'a' values, then compute sums.

Let's pick small odd \(a\) values: \(-5, -3, -1, 1, 3, 5\).

For each \(a\), compute:
- \(b = 3a\),
- \(a + b = 4a\).

Check the oddness:
- \(a\) odd,
- \(b=3a\) odd,
- \(a < 3a \Rightarrow a < 3a\),
which depends on the sign of \(a\).

- For positive \(a\), \(a < 3a\),
- For negative \(a\), \(a < 3a\), since \(a\) negative, \(3a\) also negative, but to test, for \(a < b\), with \(b=3a\):

Let's select a range, compute and print all

```python
# Enumerate small odd integers for a
possible_as = [-5, -3, -1, 1, 3, 5]
for a in possible_as:
    b = 3 * a
    if a < b:
        answer = a + b  # which is 4a
        print(f"For a={a}, b={b}, sum={answer}")
```

This code finds all candidates matching the conditions, streaming the results immediately.

for a in possible_as:
    b = 3 * a
    if a < b:
        answer = a + b  # 4 * a
        print(f"a={a}, b={b}, a + b={answer}")
