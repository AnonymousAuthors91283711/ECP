The problem involves a complex combinatorial inequality over non-negative real functions `x` and sets `A i`. To assist, we should systematically enumerate candidate values for the greatest constant `c` satisfying the inequality, starting from small rational guesses and increasing until the bound is no longer valid. We'll fix small parameters for `n` and `ℓ`, say `n=3` and `ℓ=2`, and check candidate `c` values incrementally, capturing the maximum valid `c`.

Here is the Python code that:
- Fixes `n` and `ℓ` for simplicity,
- Iterates over candidate `c` values,
- Tests the inequality with a simplified `x` and `A`,
- Prints each potential highest `c` value immediately for exploration.

This code uses straightforward, small-scale enumeration to provide insights into the problem's behavior and aids conjecture.

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

# Parameters
n = 3
l = 2

# Generate all set collections A with each |A_i| ≥ l
# For simplicity, we fix A_i as random subsets of {0,1,2} with size ≥ l
sets_list = [
    [set([0, 1]), set([1, 2])],
    [set([0, 2]), set([0, 1])],
    [set([0, 1, 2]), set([1, 2])]
]

# Candidate c values: start from 0, increment by 0.1 up to 1
for c_int in range(0, 11):
    c = Fraction(c_int, 10)
    valid = True
    for A in sets_list:
        # Simplify: choose x_i as 1 for all i, total sum = k
        k = len(A)
        x = [1.0 for _ in range(k)]
        sum_x = sum(x)
        # Compute left side
        total = 0
        for i in range(k):
            for j in range(k):
                inter_card = len(A[i].intersection(A[j]))
                term = x[i] * x[j] * (inter_card ** 2) / (len(A[i]) * len(A[j]))
                total += term
        # Compute right side
        rhs = c * (sum_x ** 2)
        if total < rhs:
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        print(f"Candidate c={float(c):.2f} holds for tested sets.")
    else:
        print(f"Candidate c={float(c):.2f} fails; maximum is less than this.")
        # Since we're increasing, print the previous c as approximate maximum
        break
```
