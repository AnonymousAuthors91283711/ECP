. Enumerated answers: Permutation: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], divisibility count: 1
Permutation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0], divisibility count: 2
Permutation: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11], divisibility count: 2
Permutation: [11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0], divisibility count: 1
Maximum divisibility set size observed: 2. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The maximum size corresponds to permutations where exactly two positions satisfy the divisibility condition, which occurs for permutations with a cycle of length 2 or certain patterns. Based on enumerated data, the maximal count is 2.
