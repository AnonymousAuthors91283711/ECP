theorem P2004AIMEII_10 :
  let p := 83;
  let q := 830;
  let prob := (S.filter (fun n => n % 9 = 0)).card / S.card;
  p.Coprime q ∧ prob = p / q ∧ p + q = 913 ∧ (p, q) = P2004AIMEII_10_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate (p, q): (133, 780) with prob approx 133/780
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
The pattern suggests p = 133 and q = 780, matching the approximate ratio 133/780 and the sum p + q = 913. Therefore, the final answer in closed form is:

<<<(133, 780)>>>

This captures the ratio and sum constraints consistent with the enumeration and problem logic.
