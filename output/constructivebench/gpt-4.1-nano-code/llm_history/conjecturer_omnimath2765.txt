abbrev omnimath2765_answer : ℚ → ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath2765 (n : ℚ) : 
  1/(2 * n) + 1/(4 * n) = 3/12 ↔ n = omnimath2765_answer 3 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 1/2: 3/2 (difference from target: 5/4)
n = 1: 3/4 (difference from target: 1/2)
n = 3/2: 1/2 (difference from target: 1/4)
n = 2: 3/8 (difference from target: 1/8)
n = 5/2: 3/10 (difference from target: 1/20)
Answer: n = 3. Expected Answer Type: ℚ → ℚ
The sum simplifies to 1/n; matching 3/12=1/4 implies n=3.  
The constant answer is n=3, regardless of input Q.
