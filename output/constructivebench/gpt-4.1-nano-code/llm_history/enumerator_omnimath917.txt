The problem appears to involve counting functions f from a finite set (Fin 2002) to integers (ℤ), with constraints:
- For each i, 1 ≤ f(i) ≤ 2002,
- The difference between f(i) and f(i+1 mod 2002) is at most 2.

This resembles counting sequences of length 2002 with certain bounded differences and values.

Since the problem is high-dimensional but constrained, a practical way is to simulate the problem for small sample sequences, explore possible values, and then deduce or conjecture the total count.

Let's choose small values for n like 4, and fixed starting values, to explore possible sequences. Because enumerating the entire case for n=2002 is infeasible directly, we'll generate ideas to help in the conjecture.

The code below will:
- Enumerate all valid sequences of length n=4 (as a sample),
- For each starting value in the range 1..2002,
- Generate sequences abiding by the difference constraint,
- Count and print total solutions for these small cases.

This aids in understanding the structure, and in forming conjectures—like the total being roughly exponential or a combinatorial count.

```python
# Enumerate small sequences with constraints to understand larger pattern
n = 4  # small sample length
min_val, max_val = 1, 2002

def generate_sequences(current_sequence):
    if len(current_sequence) == n:
        print(current_sequence)
        return 1
    count = 0
    last_value = current_sequence[-1]
    # Next value can differ by at most 2, be within bounds
    for delta in range(-2, 3):
        next_val = last_value + delta
        if min_val <= next_val <= max_val:
            count += generate_sequences(current_sequence + [next_val])
    return count

total_sequences = 0
for start in range(1, 3):  # limited to small starts for demonstration
    total_sequences += generate_sequences([start])
print(f"Total sequences for n=4 with start in 1..2: {total_sequences}")
```
