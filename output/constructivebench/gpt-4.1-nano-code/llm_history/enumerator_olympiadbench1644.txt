[write_program]
This problem appears to involve finding the maximum size `k` of a set of domino configurations with certain spatial, adjacency, and disjointness constraints. The problem is complex and resembles combinatorial tiling or packing problems, possibly related to placing dominoes on a grid with restrictions.

To assist in formulating and conjecturing the solution, I will write a Python program that:

- Fixes small sample values of parameters, e.g., `m` and `n`.
- Enumerates all possible domino configurations satisfying simplified versions of the constraints.
- Counts the maximum number of such dominoes.

Since the problem is abstract and complex, I’ll assume the constraints are manageable for small values, specifically `m, n ≤ 3`, and generate all possible domino placements.

The program will:
- Generate all potential domino placements within a grid.
- Filter for disjoint placements.
- Count the maximum set size with adjacency constraints satisfied.

Note: Since the specific constraints are complex, the code will serve as a heuristic enumeration to guide conjecture.

```python
import itertools

# Grid size parameters
m_values = [2, 3]
n_values = [2, 3]

# Generate all possible domino placements within a grid
def generate_dominoes(m, n):
    dominoes = []
    for i in range(m+1):
        for j in range(2*n):
            # Horizontal domino
            if j+1 < 2*n:
                dominoes.append(((i, j//2), (i, (j+1)//2)))
            # Vertical domino
            if i+1 <= m:
                dominoes.append(((i, j//2), (i+1, j//2)))
    return list(set(dominoes))  # remove duplicates

# Check disjointness
def disjoint(d1, d2):
    return not set(d1).intersection(d2)

# Simplified adjacency constraint: no overlapping dominoes
# For each subset, check if all dominoes are disjoint
def valid_set(domino_subset):
    for d1, d2 in itertools.combinations(domino_subset, 2):
        if not disjoint(d1, d2):
            return False
    return True

# Main enumeration
for m in m_values:
    for n in n_values:
        all_dominoes = generate_dominoes(m, n)
        max_count = 0
        # Enumerate all subsets to find maximum arrangements
        for r in range(len(all_dominoes)+1):
            for subset in itertools.combinations(all_dominoes, r):
                if valid_set(subset):
                    if r > max_count:
                        max_count = r
                        print(f"m={m}, n={n}, max dominoes={max_count}, arrangement={subset}")
```

This code:
- Enumerates small grid placements.
- Checks for disjointness.
- Finds maximum size arrangements for small parameters.

Running this heuristic helps in conjecturing an upper bound or exact maximum number of placements fitting the constraints.
