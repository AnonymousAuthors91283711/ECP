The problem involves analyzing the sequence of logarithmic terms and their differences, ultimately relating to an unknown exponent \( P2008AMCA_16_answer \). Our goal is to find the value of \( P2008AMCA_16_answer \) based on the pattern of logs and the arithmetic difference \( d \).

Step:
- Compute the initial terms explicitly: \(\text{term1} = \log(a^3 b^7)\), \(\text{term2} = \log(a^5 b^{12})\), \(\text{term3} = \log(a^8 b^{15})\).
- Simplify their differences to extract the common difference \( d \).
- Recognize that the sequence is linear in \(k\) with starting point \( \text{term1} \) and increment \( d \).
- When evaluated at \(k=12\), the sequence value is \( \text{term1} + 11d \), which equals \( \log(b^{P}) \) for some \(P\).
- Extract \( P \) in terms of \(a,b\), ultimately reducing to the exponent of \(b\).

Let's implement this reasoning in code with specific parameters \(a=1, b=1\) to simplify, then compute the resulting \(P\).

```python
# Enumerate all possible log values based on the pattern
import math

def main():
    # Choose sample values for a and b to analyze pattern (e.g., a=1, b=1)
    a = 1
    b = 1

    # Compute terms
    term1 = math.log(a**3 * b**7)
    term2 = math.log(a**5 * b**12)
    term3 = math.log(a**8 * b**15)

    # Compute differences
    d = term2 - term1
    delta = term3 - term2

    # Check if differences are equal (should be, by assumption)
    if abs(d - delta) < 1e-9:
        # The sequence is arithmetic with difference d
        # Compute the 12th term: term at k=12
        k = 12
        seq_value = term1 + (k - 1) * d
        # This equals log(b^P), so P = exponent in base b
        # Since in logs: log(b^P) = P * log(b)
        # For our sample b=1, log(1)=0, to avoid trivial zero, let's choose b=2
        # Recompute with b=2 for clarity
        a_fixed = 1
        b_fixed = 2
        term1_fixed = math.log(a_fixed**3 * b_fixed**7)
        term2_fixed = math.log(a_fixed**5 * b_fixed**12)
        term3_fixed = math.log(a_fixed**8 * b_fixed**15)
        d_fixed = term2_fixed - term1_fixed
        seq_value_fixed = term1_fixed + (k - 1) * d_fixed
        # Now, seq_value_fixed = log(b_fixed^P)
        # So, P = seq_value_fixed / log(b_fixed)
        P = seq_value_fixed / math.log(b_fixed)

        # Output the value of P
        print("Estimated P:", P)
        # The answer (as an integer exponent)
        print("Approximate P (rounded):", round(P))
    else:
        print("Differences are not equal; sequence not arithmetic as assumed.")

    main()
