This problem seems to involve finding triples \((x, y, z)\) of positive integers satisfying a certain equation and a gcd condition, then possibly demonstrating some property about such triples. Given the equation:

\[z + y^2 + x^3 = x y z\]

and the condition that \(x = \gcd(y, z)\).

Our goal is to enumerate various solutions for small values to observe any patterns, which can guide us toward understanding or conjecturing the solution set.

We'll:
- Fix small values for \(x\),
- Enumerate \(y, z\) within small bounds,
- Check the equation and the gcd condition,
- When a candidate satisfies the conditions, print it immediately.

This approach should help us generate plausible solutions without hardcoding or assuming any particular answer.

```python
import math

# Enumerate all triples (x, y, z) with small bounds:
# Conditions:
# - x, y, z > 0
# - x = gcd(y, z)
# - z + y^2 + x^3 = x * y * z

# Set bounds for enumeration
max_x = 10
max_y = 20
max_z = 20

for x in range(1, max_x + 1):
    for y in range(1, max_y + 1):
        for z in range(1, max_z + 1):
            if math.gcd(y, z) == x:
                lhs = z + y**2 + x**3
                rhs = x * y * z
                if lhs == rhs:
                    print((x, y, z))
```
