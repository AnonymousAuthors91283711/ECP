The problem seems to involve finding the minimal sum \(s = a + b + c + d\) of positive integers satisfying certain gcd conditions, specifically with coprimality and non-coprimality constraints. To aid formulating a conjecture, we will:
- Generate small tuples \((a, b, c, d)\) with positive integers.
- Check the gcd conditions explicitly.
- Enumerate all such tuples up to a reasonable bound of, say, 20 for each parameter.
- Record sums and identify the minimal sum that satisfies the conditions.

This will help find potential minimal solutions without hardcoding or assuming the answer.

```python
import math
from itertools import product

# Define bounds for enumeration
max_val = 20

# Store solutions and their sums
solutions = []

# Generate all quadruples of positive integers up to max_val
for a, b, c, d in product(range(1, max_val+1), repeat=4):
    # Check gcd conditions
    if (math.gcd(a, c) == 1 and math.gcd(b, d) == 1 and
        math.gcd(a, b) != 1 and math.gcd(b, c) != 1 and
        math.gcd(c, d) != 1 and math.gcd(d, a) != 1):
        s = a + b + c + d
        print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, sum={s}")
        solutions.append((s, a, b, c, d))

# If solutions found, identify minimal sum
if solutions:
    min_sum = min(s for s, _, _, _, _ in solutions)
    print(f"Minimal sum satisfying conditions: {min_sum}")
    # List all solutions with minimal sum
    for s, a, b, c, d in solutions:
        if s == min_sum:
            print(f"Minimal solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, sum={s}")
else:
    print("No solutions found within bounds.")
```
