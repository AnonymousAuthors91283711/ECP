[write_program]
This problem involves a logical conjunction of three equations and asks to find the value of x that satisfies all of them simultaneously, then relate it to the formulated answer `omnimath2731_answer`. 

The three equations are:
1. \(\frac{5 + x}{2} = 7\)
2. \(\frac{x + 9}{2} = 12\)
3. \(\frac{5 + 9}{2} = 10\) (which is actually true and independent of x)

Since the third equation is always true (since (5 + 9)/2 = 14/2 = 7, but the code says 10, so perhaps it's a typo or a trick). But in any case, the problem reduces to solving the first two equations simultaneously for x.

Let's write a Python program that:
- Solves the first two equations for x
- Verifies they are consistent
- Prints all solutions found (although these are unique, as linear equations)
- Sets `omnimath2731_answer` to that solution

```python
# Enumerate solutions for the system of equations:
# (5 + x)/2 = 7  =>  5 + x = 14  =>  x = 9
# (x + 9)/2 = 12 =>  x + 9 = 24 =>  x = 15
# The third equation (5 + 9)/2 = 10 is false; it's 7 instead, so probably a typo.

# Since the first two equations are incompatible (x=9 and x=15),
# there's no common solution satisfying both.
# But per the structure, the conjunction is only true if both hold simultaneously.
# Let's check for consistency.

# Implementing to confirm
solutions = []

# Solve first equation
x1 = (2 * 7) - 5  # 14 - 5 = 9
print(f"x from first equation: {x1}")

# Solve second equation
x2 = (2 * 12) - 9  # 24 - 9 = 15
print(f"x from second equation: {x2}")

# Check if either value satisfies both
# but since no value is common, solutions are inconsistent.

# For demonstration, output the solutions
# Suppose we consider only the first as a candidate
omnimath2731_answer = x1
print(f"omnimath2731_answer: {omnimath2731_answer}")
```
