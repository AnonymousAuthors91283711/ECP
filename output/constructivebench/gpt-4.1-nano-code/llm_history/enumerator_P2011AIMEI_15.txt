The problem involves determining the sum of absolute values of the roots \( a, b, c \) of a cubic polynomial relation, given that the polynomial factors as \((X - C a)(X - C b)(X - C c) = X^3 - C 2011 \times X + C m\).

Since the polynomial factors into roots \(a, b, c\), Vieta's formulas tell us:
\[ a + b + c = 0 \]
\[ ab + ac + bc = -2011 \]
\[ abc = -m \]

Given these, the goal is to enumerate all possible integer roots \(\{a, b, c\}\) satisfying the relations, especially focusing on the sum of their absolute values, \( |a| + |b| + |c| \).

Considering the symmetry, the roots can be ordered without loss of generality. To find all solutions, we will:
- Fix \(a\) and \(b\), then determine \(c = -a - b\).
- Check if the pair satisfies the symmetric sums.
- For each solution, compute \( |a| + |b| + |c| \).

This enumeration is feasible because integer roots must divide the constant term \(-m\), and the sums are constrained by the quadratic relations.

**Implementation:**
- We will sample \(m\) values, consider possible roots \(a, b\) within a small range, and verify if the roots satisfy the sum and product relations.
- We will track all possible sums \( |a| + |b| + |c| \),
- Find the minimal such sum as needed, or list all.

**Code:**

```python
# Enumerate possible integer roots a, b, c based on Vieta's formulas and constraints
def enumerate_abs_sum():
    max_root = 50  # Small range for roots to keep computation tractable
    results = set()

    # m can vary, sample some small values; for demonstration, m from -1000 to 1000
    for m in range(-1000, 1001):
        # For each pair (a, b), c = -a - b
        for a in range(-max_root, max_root + 1):
            for b in range(-max_root, max_root + 1):
                c = -a - b
                # Check if the quadratic sum condition holds: ab + ac + bc = -2011
                if a * b + a * c + b * c == -2011:
                    # Check if the product matches: a * b * c == -m
                    if a * b * c == -m:
                        sum_abs = abs(a) + abs(b) + abs(c)
                        print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, m={m}, sum_abs={sum_abs}")
                        results.add(sum_abs)
    # After enumeration, find minimum absolute sum
    if results:
        min_sum = min(results)
        print(f"Minimum absolute sum: {min_sum}")
        return min_sum
    else:
        print("No solutions found in sampled range.")
        return None
