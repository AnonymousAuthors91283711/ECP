  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∑ k in Finset.range n, (k + 1) * I ^ (k + 1) = 48 + 49 * I} P2009AMCA_15_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 97
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern of the enumerated answer (97), and the sum involves (k + 1) * I ^ (k + 1), where I is the imaginary unit, the sum resembles a derivative or geometric series involving complex powers. Testing small n suggests the sum reaches 48 + 49 I at n=97. Therefore, the minimal n is 97.
