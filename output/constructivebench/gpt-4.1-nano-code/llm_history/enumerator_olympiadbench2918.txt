This problem involves finding sequences \(a(n)\) and \(b(n)\), with \(a(n)\) an arithmetic sequence and \(b(n)\) a geometric sequence, such that their sum sequence \(c(n) = a(n) + b(n)\) fits certain values at specific points. The goal is to determine the value of \(c(5)\).

---

**Approach:**

1. Given:
   - \(a(n+1) = a(n) + d\) (arithmetic sequence)
   - \(b(n+1) = b(n) \times r\) (geometric sequence)
   - \(c(n) = a(n) + b(n)\)
   
2. Known values:
   - \(c(1) = 1\)
   - \(c(2) = 4\)
   - \(c(3) = 15\)
   - \(c(4) = 2\)

3. Express:
   - \(a(n) = a_1 + (n-1)d\)
   - \(b(n) = b_1 r^{n-1}\)
   - \(c(n) = a(n) + b(n)\)

4. Use the known \(c(n)\) to form equations and then search over small integer values for \(a_1, d, b_1, r\). Since the sequence parameters are integers (per the problem setting), enumerate small candidates systematically.

---

**Implementation:**

```python
# Enumerate possible initial values and ratios, limited to small ranges for efficiency
# Conditions:
# c(1) = a_1 + b_1 = 1
# c(2) = a_1 + d + b_1 * r = 4
# c(3) = a_1 + 2*d + b_1 * r**2 = 15
# c(4) = a_1 + 3*d + b_1 * r**3 = 2

# We will brute-force small integer values for a_1, b_1, d, r in reasonable bounds

for a1 in range(-10, 11):
    for b1 in range(-10, 11):
        for d in range(-10, 11):
            for r in range(-3, 4):  # small ratios, including negatives
                # Check integer consistency for c(2), c(3), c(4)
                c2 = a1 + d + b1 * r
                c3 = a1 + 2 * d + b1 * r ** 2
                c4 = a1 + 3 * d + b1 * r ** 3
                if (a1 + b1) == 1 and c2 == 4 and c3 == 15 and c4 == 2:
                    c5 = a1 + 4 * d + b1 * r ** 4
                    print(c5)
```

Let's analyze the situation:

**Judgment:**
The provided code brute-forces small integer values of a₁, b₁, d, r to find parameters satisfying the initial conditions on c(1) through c(4). It then computes c(5) and prints it whenever all conditions hold.

**Observations:**
- The code searches a small space, which should find solutions if they exist within that range.
- However, the conditions on c(n) involve both linear and geometric components, potentially requiring specific parameter combinations.
- The code, as written, will only print results if it finds matching parameters; otherwise, it prints nothing.
- The problem explicitly expects the program to output solutions immediately upon discovery, which it does.
- The original code seems correct in approach, but perhaps it doesn't find solutions within the search bounds or the bounds are too restrictive.

**Does the code produce any output?**
The user notes that the output is empty ("Error: Program outputs empty result"). This suggests no solutions are found within the specified bounds, which can happen if:
- The solution exists outside the search bounds, or
- There are no solutions at all within these small bounds.

**Is the approach acceptable?**
Per the instructions, the program must enumerate partial answers and finalize with the extremal solution if the problem asks for a min/max or similar.

Since the code aims to find *any* solution, it does that correctly, but maybe it's better to:
- Expand the ranges slightly for better coverage.
- Or, if the solution is known, ensure the search space includes it.

**Conclusion:**
Given the instructions, the code is technically correct even if it produces no output (it just indicates no solution within the bounds). But if the problem expects some output, then the code as-is is not meeting that expectation because no solution is found.

**Acceptance status:**
- Since the code is designed to output solutions on discovery and the problem involves enumerating answers, but it produces nothing, *it's acceptable* in the sense that it followed the process correctly — the only issue is possibly that it didn't find any solutions within bounds.
- However, based on typical expectations, the code should produce an answer if one exists within the bounds or expand bounds if none is found.

**Decision:**
I will accept the code as it follows instructions — but to improve and ensure at least an output, I will modify it to:
- Expand the search to cover more possibilities.

This appears to be an incomplete formal mathematical problem coded in Lean, but crucial parts are missing or not implemented, notably the function definitions and the solution process. The given code snippet essentially contains "sorry" placeholders, and the enumerator reports no answers because the program is empty. 

For a competition-level problem, the goal seems to involve sequences a(n) and b(n) with given recurrence relations, and specific values of c(n)=a(n)+b(n) for certain n, leading to an unknown at n=5, called olympiadbench2918_answer.

Key points:
- The code contains "sorry" which means no concrete implementation.
- The enumerator produces no answers, so straightforward enumeration isn't possible.
- The problem appears to ask us to find c(5) based on the given conditions.

Because the code is incomplete, the correct approach in such setting is to analyze the relations algebraically rather than numerically. But if we assume a small search method is intended, a typical approach would be:

- Assume a(n) is an arithmetic sequence: a(n+1) = a(n) + d
- Assume b(n) is a geometric sequence: b(n+1) = b(n) * r
- Use the known c(n) values to find sequences and the unknown c(5).

Given the constraints, the simplest correction is: Since no concrete code or search is provided, and the only output is "Error: Program is empty," we should provide a minimal enumerator that tries some small values consistent with the relations, then prints possible solutions.

Therefore, I accept that the original program is rejected.

**Corrected Program:**

This program will attempt small values for initial terms of sequences a(n) and b(n), check the given c(n) values, and estimate c(5), printing all candidates.

```python
# Enumerate small possible values for a(1), d, b(1), r to find c(5)
# based on given c(1)=1, c(2)=4, c(3)=15, c(4)=2.

# Constraints:
# a(n+1) = a(n) + d
# b(n+1) = b(n) * r
# c(n) = a(n) + b(n)

# Known:
# c(1)=1
# c(2)=4
# c(3)=15
# c(4)=2

#
