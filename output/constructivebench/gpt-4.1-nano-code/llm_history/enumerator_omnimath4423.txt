This problem appears to involve finding a characterization of bijections `f : ℤ → ℤ` that are close to the identity within a bound `k`, and expressing such functions as compositions of a small number of bijections each close to identity. We want to explore possible values of `n` and the functions `fs` satisfying the conditions, for small `k`, and see what minimal `n` can be achieved, or whether additional properties hold.

Given the complexity, a good approach is to enumerate small constructions:
- Test small `k` (like `k=1` or `k=2`)
- Check if `f` can be expressed as compositions of simple bijections close to identity, with the given bounds
- For simplicity, since the code is a formal statement, we translate the idea into enumerating potential sequences of functions.

Let's create code to generate candidate decompositions for small `n` and `k`, ensuring we do not exceed 400 tokens, and print potential functions fulfilling the specifications.

```python
# Enumerate small values of n and simple functions close to identity
# For each n up to some small limit, generate candidate sequences of functions fs
# Each fs_i is a bijection on ℤ close to identity within 1
# Since implementing full bijections on ℤ is complex, approximate with permutations over small sets and linear shifts
# For our enumeration, we consider functions like identity, shift by ±1, or simple swaps

def generate_bijections_close_to_identity():
    # Generate basic bijections f: ℤ -> ℤ close to identity within 1
    # For small samples, define functions as small shifts or permutations
    actions = [
        lambda z: z,
        lambda z: z + 1,
        lambda z: z - 1,
        lambda z: -z,
    ]
    return actions

def compose_fns(fns):
    def composed(z):
        for f in reversed(fns):
            z = f(z)
        return z
    return composed

# For small n, generate sequences of such functions, and check if the composition covers f close to identity
# Since a full check over all f: ℤ->ℤ is complex, we focus on sample functions and their compositions

print("Enumerating possible decompositions for small n and k=")
max_n = 3
k = 1  # test for k=1
actions = generate_bijections_close_to_identity()

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    # Generate all sequences of length n
    import itertools
    for seq in itertools.product(actions, repeat=n):
        comp = compose_fns(seq)
        # Test if comp is close to identity within k=1 for some sample Z
        # Check for sample values
        sample_z = [0, 1, -1, 10, -10]
        if all(abs(comp(z) - z) <= 1 for z in sample_z):
            print(f"n={n}, functions: {[f.__name__ for f in seq]}, composition");
            # Optional: list the functions explicitly
            for i, f in enumerate(seq):
                print(f"fs_{i} = {f.__name__}")
```

**Note**: Due to limitations of representing functions and verifying all integers, we approximate the enumeration by sample checks over integers near zero. This code provides candidate decompositions that might satisfy the conditions for small `k`.

This helps form conjectures about minimal `n` needed and possible constructions, satisfying the requirement to explore and print partial answers immediately.
