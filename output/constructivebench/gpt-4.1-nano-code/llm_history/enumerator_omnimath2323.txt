The problem appears to involve solving a system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
a^2 + 2b^2 - 2bc = 16 \\
2ab - c^2 = 16
\end{cases}
\]
Our goal is to enumerate solutions (a, b, c) that satisfy these equations.

To do this efficiently, we'll fix small ranges for parameters and systematically search for solutions that satisfy both equations within some tolerance. We'll output each solution immediately as we find it.

```python
# Enumerate possible solutions to the system:
# a^2 + 2b^2 - 2bc = 16
# 2ab - c^2 = 16
# Using small integer ranges for parameters to find solutions efficiently.

TOL = 1e-6  # Tolerance for floating comparison
solutions = []

# Define small ranges to search
a_range = [i * 0.5 for i in range(-20, 21)]  # from -10 to 10 in steps of 0.5
b_range = [i * 0.5 for i in range(-20, 21)]
c_range = [i * 0.5 for i in range(-20, 21)]

for a in a_range:
    for b in b_range:
        # From second equation: c^2 = 2ab
        c_squared = 2 * a * b
        # c can be Â± sqrt(c_squared) if c_squared >= 0
        if c_squared >= -TOL:
            c_pos = (c_squared ** 0.5) if c_squared >= 0 else 0
            c_candidates = [c_pos]
            if c_squared > TOL:
                c_candidates.append(-c_pos)
            for c in c_candidates:
                # Check first equation:
                lhs1 = a ** 2 + 2 * b ** 2 - 2 * b * c
                if abs(lhs1 - 16) < TOL:
                    print(f"Solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
```
