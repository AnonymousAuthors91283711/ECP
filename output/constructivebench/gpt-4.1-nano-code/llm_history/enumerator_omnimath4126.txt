The given problem appears to involve exploring the existence of some natural number \(k\) with specific algebraic relations involving parameters \(a\) and \(b\), both positive. To systematically search for solutions, we can enumerate small values of \(a\) and \(b\), compute the expression \(a^2\), and check whether it can be represented as \(k (2 a b^2 - b^3 + 1)\) for some \(k > 0\). We output each solution immediately when found, focusing on small parameters for tractability.

```python
# Enumerate small values of a and b to find solutions to the given relation
# a^2 = k * (2 * a * b^2 - b^3 + 1), with a, b > 0 and k > 0

max_a = 20  # limit for a to keep computations manageable
max_b = 20  # limit for b
solutions = []

for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_b + 1):
        denom = 2 * a * b ** 2 - b ** 3 + 1
        if denom != 0 and a * a % denom == 0:
            k = a * a // denom
            if k > 0:
                # Record and print the solution immediately
                solution = (a, b, k)
                print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, k={k}")
                solutions.append(solution)
```
