The problem appears to seek the smallest natural number n built from variables r, y, b with certain constraints, all tied to differences involving constants 10, 7, and 3. We need to find the minimal n = (10 - r) + (7 - y) + (3 - b), where r, y, b are within given bounds, and satisfy the equalities (10 - r) = (7 - y) and (7 - y) = (3 - b).

Let's analyze the constraints:

- r ≤ 10, y ≤ 7, b ≤ 3
- (10 - r) = (7 - y) = (3 - b)

All three differences are equal, say to a common value d:

(10 - r) = d → r = 10 - d  
(7 - y) = d → y = 7 - d  
(3 - b) = d → b = 3 - d

Since r, y, b are natural numbers (ℕ), and their bounds are given:

- r ≥ 0 → 10 - d ≥ 0 → d ≤ 10
- y ≥ 0 → 7 - d ≥ 0 → d ≤ 7
- b ≥ 0 → 3 - d ≥ 0 → d ≤ 3

The most restrictive is d ≤ 3 (since it's the smallest upper limit).

We can iterate over d from 0 to 3, compute r, y, b, then verify bounds.

`n = (10 - r) + (7 - y) + (3 - b) = d + d + d = 3d`

The minimal n occurs at smallest d:

- For d=0, n=0
- For d=1, n=3
- For d=2, n=6
- For d=3, n=9

All values of d in 0..3 produce valid r, y, b within their bounds.

We should print each candidate immediately.

Now, the code:

```python
# Enumerate possible common difference d based on constraints
for d in range(4):  # d from 0 to 3 inclusive
    r = 10 - d
    y = 7 - d
    b = 3 - d
    # Verify bounds
    if r >= 0 and y >= 0 and b >= 0:
        n = 3 * d
        print(n)
```

This code tabulates all candidates, streaming each as computed.  
The minimal such n is 0 at d=0.
