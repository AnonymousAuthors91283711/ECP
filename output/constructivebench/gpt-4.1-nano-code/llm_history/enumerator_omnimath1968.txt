This problem appears to involve finding the greatest number \(k\) such that there exists a finite set \(S\) of natural numbers satisfying specific closure and digit sum conditions. 

Key points:
- \(S\) is a Finset of â„•.
- \(S\) is "interval-closed": if \(a, b \in S\) with \(a \leq b\), then all integers \(n\) in the interval \([a, b]\) are in \(S\).
- For all \(n \in S\), the sum of the base-10 digits of \(n\) is not divisible by 11.
- \(S\) has size \(k\).
- The goal is to find the maximum such \(k\).

Since the problem is fairly complex, we'll choose small bounds to generate candidate sets \(S\). We'll attempt to find the largest possible set \(S\) fitting the constraints by enumerating intervals from small numbers. For efficiency, we'll restrict our enumeration to some small maximum number (say, up to 100, or a similar threshold).

We can do the following:
- Generate all candidate intervals \([a, b]\) with \(b \leq upper\_limit\).
- For each, check if the interval-closure property holds (which it should if directly constructed).
- Check whether all numbers in the interval satisfy the digit sum condition (not divisible by 11).
- Record the largest size \(k\), and output sets \(S\) with that size.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate intervals \([a, b]\) with small bounds to find maximum size \(k\)
# satisfying the properties.

def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

# Set an upper limit for enumeration
UPPER_LIMIT = 100

max_size = 0
max_sets = []

for a in range(1, UPPER_LIMIT + 1):
    for b in range(a, UPPER_LIMIT + 1):
        # Generate the interval [a, b]
        interval = list(range(a, b + 1))
        # Check if all numbers have digit sum not divisible by 11
        if all(digit_sum(n) % 11 != 0 for n in interval):
            size = len(interval)
            if size > max_size:
                max_size = size
                max_sets = [interval]
                print(f"New maximum size {size} with set: {interval}")
            elif size == max_size:
                max_sets.append(interval)
                print(f"Found another set of max size {size}: {interval}")

# After enumeration, output all maximum sets
print(f"\nMaximum set size: {max_size}")
print("Sets achieving this size:")
for s in max_sets:
    print(s)
```

This code searches for large contiguous sets within 1..100 first. It prints each maximum set immediately when found, as well as updates when larger sets are discovered, fulfilling the streaming requirement. It is efficient enough for small bounds and can be adjusted as needed.
