The problem involves proving or disproving the existence of a function \(f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) with certain properties:

- For all \( n \ge 2 \), \( f(n) \ge 2 \).
- For all \( a, b \ge 2 \), with \( a \neq b \), the function satisfies \( f(a) \times f(b) = f(a^2 \times b^2) \).

The goal is to show whether such a function exists or not.

To explore this, we can attempt to construct candidate functions satisfying the properties or determine impossibility by example.

Steps:
- For small \( a, b \ge 2 \), test the functional equation.
- Check if simple functions like constant functions or powers satisfy it.
- Attempt to find a contradiction if possible.

Here's a Python program to enumerate potential functions or values by starting with small parameters and testing the constraints.

```python
# Enumerate possible values for the function f on small inputs and test the functional equation.
# Since a universal function is difficult to construct,
# we check for consistency on small values to gauge existence.

# We set a maximum input value to test possible functions (small for efficiency).
max_n = 10

# To avoid overly complex search, we try simple functions:
# For example, constant functions, linear functions, or powers.
# We generate candidate functions and check the key property.

def check_function(f):
    for a in range(2, max_n + 1):
        for b in range(2, max_n + 1):
            if a != b:
                left = f[a] * f[b]
                key = (a ** 2) * (b ** 2)
                if key in f:
                    right = f[key]
                    if left != right:
                        return False
                else:
                    # If f(key) undefined, skip; we are testing consistency
                    pass
    return True

# Test constant functions: f(n) = c for c >= 2
for c in range(2, 5):
    f = {n: c for n in range(2, max_n + 1)}
    if check_function(f):
        print(f"Constant function f(n) = {c} satisfies the condition.")

# Test power functions: f(n) = n^k for some small k
for k in range(1, 4):
    f = {n: n ** k for n in range(2, max_n + 1)}
    if check_function(f):
        print(f"Power function f(n) = n^{k} satisfies the condition.")

# Test mixed functions or identify contradictions
# (Further systematic testing can be implemented similarly)
```
