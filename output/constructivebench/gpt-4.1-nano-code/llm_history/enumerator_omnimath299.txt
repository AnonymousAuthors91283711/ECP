This problem appears to be a formal statement involving multivariable polynomials over the real numbers. The theorem seems to claim the equivalence between a certain property and the nonexistence of a polynomial with specific evaluation properties related to positive numbers.

Given the high-level logical content, I will interpret the key components:

- The statement involves the nonexistence of a polynomial \(P : MvPolynomial (Fin 2) ℝ\) that satisfies a universal condition over all real \(x, y\).
- The polynomial's evaluation at \(\operatorname{fun}(i => if i = 0 then x else y)\) being positive iff \(x, y\) are both positive.

To assist in conjecturing, I will generate possible polynomial candidates over small sample points and check if their evaluations satisfy similar conditions. Since the exact problem is algebraic/logical and involves the nonexistence of specific polynomials, I will select small polynomial candidates over the given evaluation map.

I will generate all degree-0 and degree-1 polynomials (constants and linear forms), evaluate them over sample points \((x, y)\) with small positive/negative values, and check if their evaluation behavior resembles the described property. The code will systematically test these candidates and print those which can satisfy or violate the conditions within small thresholds. This helps in making conjectures about the statement.

```python
# Generate linear polynomials over two variables (x, y)
# Check their evaluations at small sample points for positivity conditions
# We test polynomials like constant, x, y, x + y, etc.

import itertools

# Sample small values for x, y
samples = [
    (1, 1),   # both positive
    (-1, 1),  # one negative
    (1, -1),  # one negative
    (-1, -1)  # both negative
]

# Generate candidate polynomials: constant, x, y, x + y, x - y, etc.
# For simplicity, in the form: a + b * x + c * y
coefficients = [
    (const, b, c)
    for const in [0, 1, -1]
    for b in [0, 1, -1]
    for c in [0, 1, -1]
]

# Evaluate candidates at sample points and check positivity
for const, b, c in coefficients:
    def P(x, y):
        return const + b * x + c * y
    # Check if for all sample points, P > 0 iff both x,y > 0
    positive_when_both_positive = True
    for x, y in samples:
        val = P(x, y)
        if (x > 0 and y > 0 and val <= 0) or (not (x > 0 and y > 0) and val > 0):
            positive_when_both_positive = False
            break
    # Print candidate if behavior matches initial conjecture
    print(f"Polynomial: {const} + {b}*x + {c}*y")
    print(f"Behavior matches? {positive_when_both_positive}")
```
