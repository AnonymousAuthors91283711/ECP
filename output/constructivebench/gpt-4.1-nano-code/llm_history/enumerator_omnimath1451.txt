The problem involves a set S of functions from Fin n to ℤ with a property called 'exquisite', which bounds the sum of products of pairs by 1 in absolute value. We seek the supremum over the sizes k of subsets of S whose elements are pairwise 'exquisite'. The goal seems to find a function (or value) called omnimath1451_answer(n) that relates to this supremum, potentially reflecting the maximum size of such a pairwise 'exquisite' subset.

Since the problem is quite complex and abstract, a practical way is to implement an enumeration over small subsets of S, checking the pairwise 'exquisite' property, and counting maximal subset sizes.

Given the high-level nature and the lack of specific constraints, we'll:

- Fix small n (like n=3) for enumeration.
- Generate a small sample of functions from Fin n to ℤ, e.g., all functions with values in a small bounded range.
- For each subset of functions, check pairwise 'exquisite'.
- Track the maximum subset size fulfilling the property.
- Print the maximum size found (as the answer).

This approach aligns with maximizing efficiency, avoids hardcoding, and produces streamed partial outputs. Since the problem is theoretical, the output attempts to enumerate candidate solutions, aiding in conjecture.

```python
import itertools

def main():
    n = 3  # small sample value for n
    value_range = [-1, 0, 1]  # limited range for function values
    # Generate all functions from Fin n to ℤ with values in value_range
    all_functions = list(itertools.product(value_range, repeat=n))
    # Convert to list of functions (dicts for clarity)
    functions = []
    for f_vals in all_functions:
        def f(i, fv=f_vals):
            return fv[i]
        functions.append(f)

    def exquisite(a, b):
        total = sum(a(i) * b(i) for i in range(n))
        return abs(total) <= 1

    max_size = 0
    # Test all subsets for pairwise exquisite property
    for r in range(1, len(functions) + 1):
        for subset in itertools.combinations(functions, r):
            if all(exquisite(f1, f2) for i, f1 in enumerate(subset) for f2 in subset[i+1:]):
                print(f"Found subset of size {r}")
                max_size = max(max_size, r)
    # Output the maximum subset size
    print(f"Maximum size of pairwise exquisite subset: {max_size}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
