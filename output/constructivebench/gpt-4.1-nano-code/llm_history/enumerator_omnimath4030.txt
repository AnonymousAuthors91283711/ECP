The problem is about finding all natural numbers \( n > 0 \) for which there exists a function \( x : \text{Fin } n \to \mathbb{Z} \), with each \( x(i) > 0 \), satisfying the sum:

\[
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \frac{2^{i}}{x(i)^2} = 1.
\]

The goal is to enumerate such \( n \), examine candidate solutions for \( x(i) \), and help conjecture the true set or the minimal \( n \).

Approach:
- Check small values of \( n \) (from 1 up to, say, 20).
- For each \( n \), attempt to find positive integers \( x(i) \) that satisfy the sum condition.
- Since the sum involves positive terms, and denominators are squares, start with simple guesses for \( x(i) \).

Given the structure, for small \( n \), the sum resembles a weighted harmonic series. To find solutions efficiently, fix candidate \( x(i) \) to small positive integers and check if the sum equals 1.

Implementation:
- For each \( n \), iterate over small candidates for \( x(i) \), say from 1 to 10.
- For each candidate tuple, compute the sum, and if it matches 1, output \( n \) and \( x \).

This approach is heuristic but fits the problem's purposeâ€”to assist in conjecture and proof.

```python
# Enumerate small n and candidate x(i) to find solutions satisfying the sum condition
max_n = 20
max_x = 10

print("Candidates for n with solutions:")

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    # Generate all candidate tuples x of length n with entries from 1 to max_x
    from itertools import product
    for x_candidates in product(range(1, max_x+1), repeat=n):
        total = 0
        for i, xi in enumerate(x_candidates):
            total += 2**i / (xi ** 2)
        # Check if sum is close enough to 1 within a small epsilon
        if abs(total - 1) < 1e-8:
            print(f"n={n}, x={x_candidates}, sum={total}")
```
