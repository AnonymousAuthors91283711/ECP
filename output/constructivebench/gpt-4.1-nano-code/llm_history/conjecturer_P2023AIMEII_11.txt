The problem essentially asks for the maximum number of 4-element subset families of a 5-element set such that any two have a non-empty intersection. The only such family is the family of all 4-subsets, which has size 5. Since the enumeration yielded 0, but to satisfy the intersecting condition, the maximum set size is 5 (the total number of 4-element subsets). 
Therefore, the answer should be 5.
