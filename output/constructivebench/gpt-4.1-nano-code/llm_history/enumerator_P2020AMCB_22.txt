The problem asks to find the greatest element in the range of the function \( f(t) = \frac{(2^t - 3t) t}{4^t} \), where \( t \) varies over the real numbers. Since \( f(t) \) involves exponential and polynomial parts, the approach is to analyze the function for some small sample values of \( t \) and look for maximum candidates. 

Because the problem involves an infinite domain, and the function tends to zero as \( t \to \pm \infty \), the maximum occurs at some finite \( t \). To find a candidate maximum, evaluate \( f(t) \) for small integer values of \( t \), then compare the values to conjecture the maximum.

```python
import math

# Define the function based on the given expression
def f(t):
    numerator = (2**t - 3*t) * t
    denominator = 4**t
    return numerator / denominator

# Sample points to evaluate, including small integers and some fractional points
sample_points = [0, 1, 2, 3, -1, -2, -3, 0.5, 1.5, -0.5]

# Evaluate the function at sample points
values = [(t, f(t)) for t in sample_points]

# Print each evaluated point and its function value
for t, val in values:
    print(f"t = {t}, f(t) = {val}")

# Determine maximum among sampled points
max_t, max_value = max(values, key=lambda x: x[1])
print(f"\nCandidate maximum at t = {max_t} with value f(t) = {max_value}")
```
