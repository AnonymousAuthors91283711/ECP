The sum over divisors involves the divisor-counting function, and the sum of floor division can be simplified using properties of divisors and harmonic sums. Observations from enumerations suggest the sum equals a quadratic in n, specifically for n=2012, sum =  (2012)(2013)/2. 

Answer: <<<2012 * 2013 / 2>>>
