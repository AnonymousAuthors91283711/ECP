Ground Truth Answer: { (a, b) | a = b ∨ ∃ k : ℕ, a - b = 2^k ∨ b - a = 2^k }
Proposed Answer: { (a,b) | (a=1 ∧ b=1) ∨ (a=1 ∧ b % 2 = 1) ∨ (a=1 ∧ b % 2 = 0 ∧ b > 1) ∨ (a ≥ 2) }
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for conditions on pairs (a,b) where the gcd(a^n + b, b^n + a) stabilizes to some constant g for all sufficiently large n.

2. The ground truth answer states this happens when:
   - a = b, or
   - the absolute difference between a and b is a power of 2

3. The proposed answer suggests completely different conditions based on:
   - a=1 and various cases for b, or
   - a ≥ 2 regardless of b

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It doesn't capture the case where a = b (which is clearly correct in ground truth)
- It doesn't properly handle the power-of-2 difference condition
- The cases it presents (especially a ≥ 2) are too broad and don't match the actual condition

For example:
- (a=3, b=1) should be valid (since 3-1=2^1), but proposed answer would accept it only because a ≥ 2
- (a=5, b=3) should be invalid (difference is 2, which is 2^1), but proposed answer would accept it because a ≥ 2
- (a=2, b=4) should be invalid (difference is 2, which is 2^1), but proposed answer would accept it
