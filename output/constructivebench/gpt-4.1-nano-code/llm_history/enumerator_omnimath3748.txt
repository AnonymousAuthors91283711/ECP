The problem appears to involve two divisibility conditions on a specific expression involving m and n, with m, n positive integers. We aim to find all pairs (m, n) with m, n > 0 such that both m and n divide \( 9^{|m - n|} + 3^{|m - n|} + 1 \).

To tackle this computationally, for small values, we can:

- Fix small parameters for m and n
- Compute the expression \( 9^{|m - n|} + 3^{|m - n|} + 1 \)
- Check if m and n divide it
- Record those pairs as candidates

Since the divisibility depends only on the difference \( d = |m - n| \), and the expression simplifies to \( 9^d + 3^d + 1 \), we only need to check pairs with small differences first and examine divisors.

Here's a Python program to enumerate pairs with \( m, n \leq 20 \), focusing on differences up to 10, and print all pairs where the divisibility conditions hold:

```python
# Enumerate pairs (m, n) with m, n in [1, 20]
# For small difference d, compute expression and check divisibility
max_mn = 20
max_diff = 10

for d in range(max_diff + 1):
    value = 9 ** d + 3 ** d + 1
    for m in range(1, max_mn + 1):
        n = m + d
        if n > max_mn:
            continue
        # Check divisibility
        if value % m == 0 and value % n == 0:
            print(f"Pair (m, n)=({m}, {n}) with difference {d} divides {value}")
        # Also check the symmetric pair with difference -d
        if d != 0:
            n = m - d
            if n >= 1:
                if value % m == 0 and value % n == 0:
                    print(f"Pair (m, n)=({m}, {n}) with difference {-d} divides {value}")
```

This code outputs pairs with small m, n up to 20, efficiently checking the divisibility conditions. It can be extended for larger ranges.

Full program:
```python
# Enumerate pairs (m, n) with m, n in [1, 20] for small differences
max_mn = 20
max_diff = 10

for d in range(max_diff + 1):
    value = 9 ** d + 3 ** d + 1
    for m in range(1, max_mn + 1):
        n = m + d
        if n > max_mn:
            continue
        if value % m == 0 and value % n == 0:
            print(f"Pair (m, n)=({m}, {n}) with difference {d} divides {value}")
        # Check symmetric pair if d != 0
        if d != 0:
            n = m - d
            if n >= 1:
                if value % m == 0 and value % n == 0:
                    print(f"Pair (m, n)=({m}, {n}) with difference {-d} divides {value}")
```
