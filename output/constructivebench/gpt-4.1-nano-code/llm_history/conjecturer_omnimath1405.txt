Sum of all such n: 512. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the numbers with exactly 6 divisors where divisors are ordered with each subsequent divisor at least twice the previous, starting from 1. Checking the enumerated answers, these numbers are exactly the squares of primes, with constraints matching prime squares (e.g., 2^2=4, 3^2=9, etc.). The sum is 512, that is 2^9. This aligns with the sum over prime squares less than 100. The primes squared less than 100 are 4, 9, 25, 49, 121 (exceeding 100). Therefore, the numbers are 4, 9, 25, and 49, summing to 87. But the sum of the enumerated answers (32,44,50,52,68,76,92,98) must be considered. The sum of these is 512. The approximate pattern matches the total sum, but individual answers resemble the prime square pattern with some multiples.

Final conjecture: the answer is the sum of specific numbers with six divisors matching these criteria, and the sum is 512.

Based on the provided sum and pattern, the answer should be:

<<<512>>>
