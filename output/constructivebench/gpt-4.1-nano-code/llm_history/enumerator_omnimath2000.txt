The goal appears to be to evaluate the imaginary part of a complex product involving roots of unity, specifically for certain values of `k`. The product involves ω, a primitive 727th root of unity, raised to powers of powers of 3. To approximate this, we'll:

- Choose small values for `k` corresponding to `k + 8` from 8 to 13.
- Compute each `f(k)` as defined.
- Calculate the product of these `f(k)`s.
- Extract the imaginary part of the product.
- Use the sine function relation to express the imaginary part as a sine of some angle.
- Print the angle `α` associated with the imaginary part, which should lie within `(-π/2, π/2)`.

Below, the code explicitly enumerates these computations for the small sample of `k` values, printing the resulting angles (`α`) approximations.

```python
import math
import cmath

# Primitive 727th root of unity
N = 727
omega = cmath.exp(2 * math.pi * 1j / N)

def f(k):
    power = 3 ** (k - 1)
    return 1 + omega ** power + omega ** (2 * power)

# Range from k=8 to k=13
k_values = range(8, 14)
product = 1+0j
for k in k_values:
    val = f(k)
    product *= val
    print(f'k={k}, f(k)={val}')

# Calculate the imaginary part
im_part = product.imag
# Compute the angle alpha such that sin(alpha) = imaginary part
# Ensure the value is within [-1, 1] for safe arcsin
clipped = max(-1, min(1, im_part))
alpha = math.asin(clipped)

print(f'Imaginary part of product: {im_part}')
print(f'Approximate alpha (angle with sin={clipped}): {alpha}')
```
