The given problem involves summing the digits of the product of two large numbers, `888888` and `9999999`. To assist in conjecturing the sum of these digits, we'll write a Python program that computes the product, sums its digits, and prints the partial result immediately. This approach helps verify the pattern or the specific sum without hardcoding the result.

Since the problem asks for a summation of the individual digits, we will directly compute the product and sum the digits.

```python
# Compute the product of 888888 and 9999999
product = 888888 * 9999999

# Convert the product to string to iterate over each digit
digits_str = str(product)

# Sum the digits
sum_digits = sum(int(d) for d in digits_str)

# Print the sum immediately
print(sum_digits)
```

This code will output the sum of digits for the product, aiding in conjecture and verification.
