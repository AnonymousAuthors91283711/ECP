[write_program]
This problem involves working with the roots of a polynomial expression and summing them. The polynomial appears to be formed by factoring and combining linear terms. To assist in conjecturing the sum of roots, I will explicitly enumerate candidate roots for the polynomial obtained and compute their sum. Since the problem is a competition-level question likely involving simple algebraic manipulations, I will focus on the resulting quadratic by expanding and simplifying, then finding roots analytically or numerically if needed, to confirm the sum.

I'll create a Python program that:
- Expands the polynomial roots expression.
- Finds the roots analytically (quadratic formula).
- Sums the roots.
- Prints potential roots and the sum immediately as I find them.

Given the constraints, I will pick small sample values to explore and approximate roots if necessary, but the main approach will involve explicit symbolic computation.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variable
X = sp.symbols('X')

# Define the polynomial parts
poly_part1 = (2*X + 3) * (X - 4)
poly_part2 = (2*X + 3) * (X - 6)
# Sum of both parts
poly_expr = poly_part1 + poly_part2

# Expand the polynomial
expanded_expr = sp.expand(poly_expr)
print("Expanded polynomial:", expanded_expr)

# Find roots
roots = sp.solve(expanded_expr, X)

# Print roots and their sum immediately
roots_as_nums = [root.evalf() for root in roots]
print("Roots found:", roots_as_nums)

roots_sum = sum(roots_as_nums)
print("Sum of roots:", roots_sum)
```
