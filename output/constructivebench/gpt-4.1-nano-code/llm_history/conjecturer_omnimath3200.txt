abbrev omnimath3200_answer : ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath3200 (n : ℤ) : 5 * (n - 2) = 85 ↔ n = omnimath3200_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 19. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The given equation simplifies to 5*(n-2)=85 ⇒ n-2=17 ⇒ n=19. The enumeration confirms this, and the pattern suggests the answer is a constant expression.  
<<<19>>>
