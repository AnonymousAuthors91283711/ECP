The problem involves analyzing a painting process where multiple painters toggle colors based on divisibility, and we need to count how many positions from 1 to 100 result in a red color after all painters finish. This resembles a classic toggling problem, where the color at position n depends on the number of divisors of n. Odd number of toggles results in red; even results in not red. 

Our goal: Find how many integers n in [1, 100] have an odd number of divisors, i.e., perfect squares. To assist, we enumerate perfect squares â‰¤ 100, which are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100.

Here's the Python code that computes and outputs all perfect squares up to 100, handling the "streaming" aspect and matching the problem's parameters.

```python
# Python code to enumerate perfect squares up to 100
limit = 100
for n in range(1, limit + 1):
    if int(n ** 0.5) ** 2 == n:
        print(n)
```
