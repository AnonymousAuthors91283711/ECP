Maximum size of S: 18. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem asks for the maximum size of a set \( S \subseteq \{1,\dots,30\} \) with the property that no two elements sum to a multiple of 5. The pattern suggests the answer is 18, matching the enumeration.

The construct involves avoiding pairs whose sum is divisible by 5. Grouping numbers mod 5 reveals that the maximum independent set size avoiding such pairs is 18, based on the density of residues and pairing restrictions.
