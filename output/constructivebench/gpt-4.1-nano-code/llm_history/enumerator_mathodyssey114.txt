The problem involves counting how many numbers t in the range [0, 2400) have a digit sum less than the digit sum of 2021, then dividing that count by 2400. To explore possible answers, we'll enumerate all t in 0..2399, compute their digit sums, compare with digitSum(2021), and count how many satisfy the inequality. Then, we will approximate the fraction (count / 2400) as a rational number.

Note: digitSum(2021) = 2 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 5, so we're counting numbers with digit sum < 5. 

We'll:
- Iterate over t in 0..2399
- Calculate digit sum
- Count how many t have digit sum < 5
- Output the count / 2400 as a rational approximation

The approximation will be exact because counts are integers, dividing by 2400.

```python
# Enumerate all t in [0, 2399], count how many have digitSum(t) < 5,
# then divide by 2400 to get the fraction.

def digit_sum(n):
    return (n // 1000) + (n // 100 % 10) + (n // 10 % 10) + (n % 10)

limit = 2400
threshold = 5  # digit sum less than 5
count = 0

for t in range(limit):
    if digit_sum(t) < threshold:
        count += 1
        print(f"t = {t}, digitSum(t) = {digit_sum(t)}")  # stream answers as they are found

fraction_numer = count
fraction_denom = 2400

print(f"Count: {count}")
print(f"Fraction: {fraction_numer}/{fraction_denom}")
```
