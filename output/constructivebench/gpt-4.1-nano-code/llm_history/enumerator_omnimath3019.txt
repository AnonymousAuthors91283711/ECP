This problem asks us to find the value of \( (3)^{x+2} \) given that \( 3^x = 5 \). Since \( 3^x = 5 \), then \( 3^{x+2} = 3^x \cdot 3^2 \). We can use basic properties of exponents to compute this directly.

To help in a case where we need to explore various possible values or verify some assumptions, I will write a Python script that:
- Computes \( x \) via the given equation,
- Then calculates \( 3^{x+2} \),
- Streamlines the output by printing each intermediate answer immediately.

Here is the code:

```python
import math

# Given the equation: 3^x = 5
# Compute x
x = math.log(5, 3)
print(f"Computed x from 3^x = 5: x = {x}")

# Compute 3^(x+2)
answer = 3 ** (x + 2)
print(f"Answer for (3)^(x+2): {answer}")

# Since 3^x = 5, then 3^(x+2) = 3^x * 3^2 = 5 * 9 = 45
# Output the exact value
print(f"Exact answer using properties: {5 * 9}")
```
