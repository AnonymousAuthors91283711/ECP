abbrev P2013AMCB_1_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2013AMCB_1 :
  ∃! (low : ℝ), 
    let high := low + 16
    (high + low) / 2 = 3 ∧ low = P2013AMCB_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solution found: low = -5. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Since the average of `low` and `high` is 3, and `high = low + 16`, then: `(low + (low + 16))/2 = 3`. Solving gives `low = -5`. The answer depends solely on the equations provided, so the expression is: 

<<<-5>>>
