. Enumerated answers: Found pair: a=7, b=42
Found pair: a=8, b=24
Found pair: a=9, b=18
Found pair: a=10, b=15
Found pair: a=12, b=12
Total solutions: 5. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The solutions satisfy a/b + 1/b = 1/6, leading to a relation a b = 6(a + b). Solving yields specific pairs with (a, b) in { (7,42), (8,24), (9,18), (10,15), (12,12) } and all satisfy a ≤ b with positive integers. The count of solutions is 5.

Found pair: a=10, b=15
Found pair: a=12, b=12
Total solutions: 5. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The current proposed answer concatenates expressions with an equality, which returns a Prop type, not a ℕ. The number of solutions is 5, as identified from the enumerations. The task is to produce a closed-form ℕ value representing this count.

Given the five solutions (a,b):
- (7,42),
- (8,24),
- (9,18),
- (10,15),
- (12,12),
it's clear that the total number of solutions is 5.

Therefore, the correct answer should be the natural number 5.

To fix the code, replace the expression with a ℕ constant, which in Lean is written directly.

The correct form:

<<<5>>>
