abbrev omnimath3201_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3201 :
  (50 * 76 - 40 * 80) / (50 - 40) = omnimath3201_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Exact value: 60.0
Approximate value (rounded to 3 decimals): 60.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The expression simplifies to a difference quotient: \(\frac{50 \times 76 - 40 \times 80}{50 - 40}\). Computing numerator: \(50 \times 76 = 3800\), \(40 \times 80 = 3200\), numerator \(3800 - 3200 = 600\). Denominator \(50 - 40 = 10\). Therefore, the value is \(600/10 = 60\). 

Final answer: <<<60.0>>>
