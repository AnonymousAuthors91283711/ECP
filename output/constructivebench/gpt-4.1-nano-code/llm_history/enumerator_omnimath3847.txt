This problem appears to involve characterizing functions \(g : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) such that \((g m + n)(g n + m)\) is a perfect square for all natural numbers \(m, n\). The statement hints at a set \(\text{omnimath3847_answer}\) of such functions, with the theorem asserting an equivalence between a certain property and membership in this set.

Given the constraints, I'll write a Python script to enumerate simple candidate functions \(g(n)\), especially linear functions like constant or linear, and test the perfect square condition for small \(m, n\). The goal is to gain insight into what functions satisfy the condition, by streaming solutions.

**Implementation plan:**
- Consider simple forms of \(g(n)\): constant, linear.
- For small \(m, n \leq 10\), check if \((g m + n)(g n + m)\) is a perfect square.
- Print each candidate \(g(n)\) when it satisfies the pattern for all tested pairs.
- Focus on efficiency: avoid unnecessary calculations, stop testing a candidate once a counterexample occurs.

This exploratory approach helps hypothesize the form of functions in \(\text{omnimath3847_answer}\).

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(x):
    if x < 0:
        return False
    root = int(math.isqrt(x))
    return root * root == x

# Candidate functions: constant and linear functions
candidate_functions = []

# Test constant functions g(n) = c for c in 0..5
for c in range(6):
    def g_const(n, c=c):
        return c
    # Check for small m, n
    valid = True
    for m in range(1, 11):
        for n in range(1, 11):
            val = (g_const(m) + n) * (g_const(n) + m)
            if not is_perfect_square(val):
                valid = False
                break
        if not valid:
            break
    if valid:
        # Record the constant function
        def g(n, c=c):
            return c
        print(f"Constant function: g(n) = {c}")
        candidate_functions.append(g)

# Test linear functions: g(n) = a*n + b for small a, b in 0..2
for a in range(3):
    for b in range(3):
        def g_linear(n, a=a, b=b):
            return a * n + b
        valid = True
        for m in range(1, 11):
            for n in range(1, 11):
                val = (g_linear(m) + n) * (g_linear(n) + m)
                if not is_perfect_square(val):
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            print(f"Linear function: g(n) = {a}*n + {b}")
            candidate_functions.append(g_linear)

# Note: Further forms can be tested similarly.
```
