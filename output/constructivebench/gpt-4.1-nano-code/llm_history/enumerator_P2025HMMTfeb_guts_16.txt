This problem involves a polynomial \(f\), a sequence \(g\) with a recurrence relation, and an auxiliary sequence \(a\) defined in terms of \(f\) and \(g\). Given some initial values of \(a\), the goal is to find the ratio \(\frac{g(2)}{g(1)}\).

The sequence \(g\) satisfies \(g(n+1) = g(1) \cdot \left(\frac{g(2)}{g(1)}\right)^n\), which suggests \(g(n) = g(1) \cdot r^{n-1}\), where \(r = \frac{g(2)}{g(1)}\).

Given the values for \(a\):
- \(a(1) = f(1) + g(2)\)
- \(a(2) = f(2) + g(3)\)
- \(a(3) = f(3) + g(4)\)
- \(a(4) = f(4) + g(5)\)
- \(a(5) = f(5) + g(6)\)

Assuming \(f\) is arbitrary and polynomial, and seeking the ratio \(r\), we can try small sample values for \(f\) and analyze possible \(r\).

Here's a Python script that enumerates possible ratios assuming the initial \(a(n)\) values and a simple polynomial \(f\) like linear or constant, examining all small rational ratios \(r\) to see which satisfy the initial values.

```python
# Enumerate small rational ratios r to estimate g(n) and fit f accordingly
# Given the constraints: a1=1, a2=2, a3=3, a4=14, a5=16
# For simplicity, assume f(n) is linear, f(n) = c * n + d, and test different ratios r

# Derived:
# g(n) = g(1) * r^{n-1}
# a(n) = f(n) + g(n+1)

# For each candidate r in small rational numbers, solve for c,d,g(1)

ratios = [i/10 for i in range(1, 11)]  # r = 0.1 to 1.0
answers = set()

for r in ratios:
    # Set g(1)=1 for simplicity, then compute g(n)
    # from g(n)=g(1)*r^{n-1}
    g1 = 1
    g_vals = [g1 * (r ** (n-1)) for n in range(1, 7)]  # g(1) to g(6)
    # Using a(n) = f(n) + g(n+1), f(n) = a(n) - g(n+1)
    # For linear f: f(n) = c * n + d
    # We have:
    # f(1) = a(1) - g(2) =1 - g_vals[1]
    # f(2) = a(2) - g(3) =2 - g_vals[2]
    # f(3) = a(3) - g(4) =3 - g_vals[3]
    # For f(n) linear, c,d must satisfy:
    # c*1 + d = a(1) - g(2)
    # c*2 + d = a(2) - g(3)
    # c*3 + d = a(3) - g(4)

    c_candidates = []
    d_candidates = []
    # Solve for c and d using the first two equations:
    denom = 2 - 1
    # c = ((a2 - g3) - (a1 - g2)) / (2 -1)
    c = ((2 - g_vals[2]) - (1 - g_vals[1])) / 1
    d = (1 - g_vals[1]) - c * 1

    # Check the next value:
    # a3 = f(3) + g(4) = 3c + d + g(4)
    a3_calc = 3 * c + d + g_vals[3]
    if abs(a3_calc - 3) < 1e-6:
        # Valid candidate
        answers.add(r)

# Print all candidate ratios r
for r in answers:
    print(f"Possible ratio g(2)/g(1): {r}")
