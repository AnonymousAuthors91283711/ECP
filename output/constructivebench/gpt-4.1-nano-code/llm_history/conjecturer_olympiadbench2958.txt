noncomputable abbrev olympiadbench2958_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2958 (A B : ℝ) :
    ∃ (x y : ℝ), x ≠ y ∧ 
    x^3 + A * x + 10 = 0 ∧ y^3 + A * y + 10 = 0 ∧
    x^3 + B * x^2 + 50 = 0 ∧ y^3 + B * y^2 + 50 = 0 ∧
    x * y = olympiadbench2958_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found: x=-2.000, y=-3.503, x*y=7.006. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the product x*y approaches a constant value related to the roots' symmetry. Considering the approximate numeric product 7.006 ~ 7, it indicates the answer may be exactly 7, possibly derived from the symmetry or factorization of the polynomials given.
