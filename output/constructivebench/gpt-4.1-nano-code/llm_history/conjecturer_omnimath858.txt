The problem asks for the number of permutations of 10 elements where each element is moved (no fixed points) and each element's image under permutation is such that applying permutation twice yields the original element (involution). These are fixed-point-free involutions (or perfect matchings). The count of such involutions on a set of size n is known to follow the formula: sum_{k=0}^{floor(n/2)} ((n)! / (2^k k! (n-2k)!)). For n=10, this sum simplifies to the number of perfect matchings: (10)! / (2^5 * 5!).

final count = (10)! / (2^5 * 5!) = 945

The current attempted answer is a verbose explanation mixed within the definition, which causes syntax errors because `abbrev` expects a straightforward expression. The key is to provide a closed-form, mathematical expression that Lean can interpret as a natural number directly.

The number of fixed-point-free involutions (derangements where p(p(i)) = i) on 10 elements corresponds to the number of perfect matchings in a complete graph K_{10}, which equals (10)! / (2^5 * 5!) by the double factorial formula. Calculating this explicitly:

- (10)! = 3,628,800
- 2^5 = 32
- 5! = 120

So, the count is 3,628,800 / (32 * 120) = 3,628,800 / 3,840 = 945.

The correct Lean expression should directly encode this number.
