Ground Truth Answer: 52
Proposed Answer: 100
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves counting numbers from 1 to 100 (n+1 where n ∈ range 100) that end up red after a specific painting process.

2. The painting process involves:
   - 50 painters (1 through 50)
   - Each odd-numbered painter (1,3,5...) is red (color=true)
   - A number n gets flipped (color changed) by painter k if k divides n
   - Final color is red if there's an odd number of effective flips to red

3. This is essentially equivalent to counting numbers from 1 to 100 with an odd number of odd divisors (since only odd painters cause red flips, and only divisors cause flips).

4. The only numbers with an odd number of divisors are perfect squares (since divisors normally come in pairs, but squares have one unpaired divisor).

5. There are 10 perfect squares between 1 and 100 (1² through 10²), but we need those with an odd number of odd divisors.

6. Among perfect squares, only the odd squares (1,9,25,49,81) have an odd number of odd divisors. Even squares (4,16,36,64,100) have an even number of odd divisors.

7. Therefore, there should be 5 numbers that end up red, not 52 or 100.

Wait, this contradicts both answers. Let me re-examine:

Looking back at the problem, the ground truth says 52 and proposed says 100. Neither matches my calculation of 5. 

The proposed answer of 100 is clearly wrong as it suggests all numbers would be red. The ground truth of 52 also seems incorrect based on this analysis. 

However, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the color alternates starting from some base color, not just counting odd divisors. Without more context about the initial color, it's hard to be certain.

Given that both answers seem incorrect based on standard interpretation, but the proposed answer is definitely wrong while the ground truth might be closer, I'll return:

<<<False>>>
