Based on enumerations, the solutions are linear functions with slope proportional to n, scaled by multiples of α. Hence, the general solution is f(n) = c * n, where c ∈ ℝ scales proportionally with α. Given the pattern, the canonical form is f(n) = (α - k) * n for some k in ℝ, encompassing all observed solutions. Since the pattern suggests the solution is a linear function of n scaled by α, the most natural closed-form parametrization, eliminating existential quantifiers, is:

<<<fun α : ℝ => λ n : ℕ+ => α * n>>>
