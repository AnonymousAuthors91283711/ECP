This problem appears to be a recurrence relation involving functions f and g defined on natural numbers, with specific initial conditions, and asks to find the least n > 0 such that \(f(n) \times 7 = g(n) \times 4\). To assist in conjecturing and verifying the minimal such n, I will generate potential values of n, compute f(n) and g(n), and check the equation. I'll choose small sample values and iteratively compute until the condition is satisfied.

Since the functions are not explicitly defined, but are related via the recurrence \(f(n) = 2 f(n - 1) + g(n - 1)\), and the initial conditions \(f(0) = 1\), \(g(0) = 0\), I will assume an additional plausible recurrence pattern for g to generate consistent sequences.

In absence of g's recurrence, I will assume g is zero at all points for initial testing; then n=1,2,... will be tested for the condition. If no such n satisfies \(f(n)*7 = g(n)*4\), I will test other simple g sequences, such as \(g(n) = c\) or \(g(n) = d \times n\), to find solutions.

Given the problem constraints, I will attempt a simple g(n)=0, then g(n)=n, and so on, to see if a solution appears.

Now, the code:

```python
# Generate sequences of f and g based on the recurrence
# f(n) = 2*f(n-1) + g(n-1), with initial conditions f(0)=1, g(0)=0
# For g, try different simple sequences, e.g., constant 0, n, or 1.

# Enumerate over small initial g sequences to find minimal n > 0 satisfying the condition

def find_min_n():
    max_n = 20  # limit for enumeration
    for g_value in [lambda n: 0, lambda n: n, lambda n: 1]:
        f = [1]  # f(0)
        g_seq = [g_value(0)]  # g(0)
        for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
            g_n = g_value(n - 1)
            g_seq.append(g_n)
            f_n = 2 * f[-1] + g_seq[-2]  # f(n) based on previous
            f.append(f_n)
            # Check for the condition n>0
            if n > 0 and f_n * 7 == g_n * 4:
                print(f"Solution found with initial g(n)={g_value.__name__ if hasattr(g_value,'__name__') else g_value}: n={n}")
                print(f"f({n})={f_n}, g({n})={g_n}")
                return n
    print("No solution found within range.")
    return None

find_min_n()
```
