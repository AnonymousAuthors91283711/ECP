This problem asks us to find the smallest natural number \( d \) such that there exist positive integers \( a \) and \( b \) with \( a \times b = 2010 \), \( a > b \), and \( d = a - b \). Essentially, we are looking for the minimal difference between factors of 2010 with the larger factor being \( a \).

To approach this, we can:
- Enumerate all factor pairs \( (a, b) \) with \( a > b \) and \( a \times b = 2010 \).
- Calculate their differences \( a - b \).
- Find the minimal difference among these.

Since 2010 is a fixed number, we can factor it directly (or enumerate divisors up to sqrt(2010)), then evaluate difference for each pair.

```python
# Enumerate all pairs of factors a, b with a*b=2010 and a>b
n = 2010
import math

min_diff = None

for a in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
    if n % a == 0:
        b = n // a
        if a > b:
            diff = a - b
            print(f"Factor pair: ({a}, {b}), difference: {diff}")
            if min_diff is None or diff < min_diff:
                min_diff = diff

# Output the minimal difference found
print(f"Minimal difference d: {min_diff}")
```
