The problem involves analyzing differences between pairs of powers of 2 for n in 0 to 10, then summing these differences for pairs where a > b, and finally taking the result modulo 1000. To find the answer, we need to explicitly compute the sum of all a - b where a and b are distinct elements from S, with a > b.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
- S = {2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^{10}}
- Pairs (a, b) where a > b
- Sum of a - b for these pairs
- Compute total modulo 1000

Since S is small (11 elements), we can brute-force all pairs and sum accordingly. This approach guarantees correctness and efficiency.

```python
# Generate the set S of powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^10
S = [2 ** n for n in range(11)]
pairs = []

# Sum of (a - b) over all pairs with a > b
total_sum = 0
for i in range(len(S)):
    for j in range(i):
        a = S[i]
        b = S[j]
        diff = a - b
        total_sum += diff
        print(diff)  # Output each difference for verification

# Compute result modulo 1000
result = total_sum % 1000
print('Result modulo 1000:', result)
```
