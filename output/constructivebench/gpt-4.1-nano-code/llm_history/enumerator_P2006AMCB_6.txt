The problem appears to be a simple calculation involving the expression (25 + 386) * 200 / (100 + 100 + 400). To assist in verifying or exploring possible answers, I'll write a Python script that enumerates all plausible numerator and denominator combinations around the given values to find approximate or exact results.

Since the expression seems straightforward and involves small integers, the goal is to verify the value or find related rational approximations.

Here's a Python program that computes the expression directly, as well as searches nearby values for confirmation or alternative results, streaming each answer immediately.

```python
# Enumerate nearby values for numerator and denominator to verify the calculation
# Expression: (25 + 386) * 200 / (100 + 100 + 400)

# Base values
num_base = 25 + 386
den_base = 100 + 100 + 400

# Function to compute and stream results
def compute_and_stream(numerators, denominators):
    for n in numerators:
        for d in denominators:
            result = n / d
            print(f"Numerator={n}, Denominator={d} => Result={result}")

# Explore values around the base
numerators = [num_base - 1, num_base, num_base + 1]
denominators = [den_base - 1, den_base, den_base + 1]

compute_and_stream(numerators, denominators)

# Also print the exact value of the original expression
exact_value = (25 + 386) * 200 / (100 + 100 + 400)
print("Exact value of the original expression:", exact_value)
```
