(hP0 : P.eval 0 = k)
(hP1 : P.eval 1 = 2 * k)

. Enumerated answers: Enumerated solutions (assuming quadratic polynomial):
For k=-10: P(2)+P(-2) = -140.0
For k=-1: P(2)+P(-2) = -14.0
For k=0: P(2)+P(-2) = 0.0
For k=1: P(2)+P(-2) = 14.0
For k=10: P(2)+P(-2) = 140.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
The pattern suggests a linear relationship between k and P(2) + P(-2), symmetric around 0, with values scaled by 14 and 140 for |k|=1 or 10. The pattern indicates P(2)+P(-2) = 14 * k. 

Thus, the closed form answer is:

<<<fun k : ℝ => 14 * k>>>
