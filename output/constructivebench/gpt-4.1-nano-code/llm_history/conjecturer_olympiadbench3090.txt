theorem olympiadbench3090 (k : ℕ) (r s : ℝ) :
  fib (k + 2) + fib (k + 1) * r + fib k * r^2 = 0 ∧
  fib (k + 2) + fib (k + 1) * s + fib k * s^2 = 0 → 
  (r + 1) * (s + 1) = olympiadbench3090_answer k := by sorry. Enumerated answers: k=0, r=0.000, s=0.000, (r+1)(s+1)=1.000
k=0, r=0.000, s=-1.000, (r+1)(s+1)=0.000
k=0, r=-1.000, s=0.000, (r+1)(s+1)=0.000
k=0, r=-1.000, s=-1.000, (r+1)(s+1)=0.000. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The solutions suggest r and s are roots of the quadratic with coefficients related to Fibonacci numbers. For solutions with s or r equal to -1 or 0, the expressions (r+1)(s+1) are either 0 or 1. The pattern indicates the answer depends on Fibonacci numbers, giving (r+1)(s+1) as F_{k+1} (Fibonacci number). 

Since Fibonacci of (k+1) is always a natural number, the simplest closed form matching enumerated outcomes is F_{k+1}.
