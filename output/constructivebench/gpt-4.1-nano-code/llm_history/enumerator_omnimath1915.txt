This problem involves complex numbers and distances, likely related to geometric constraints. Given the distances:
- dist(z, 1) = 2
- dist(z^2, 1) = 6

We aim to find the real part of z. To approach this without hardcoding, we'll explore all plausible complex numbers z that satisfy these distances, focusing on the real component. We will perform a parameter sweep over plausible real parts and check the distance conditions to find candidates.

```python
import math

# Define parameters
threshold_real = 4  # Reasonable upper bound for real part since distance from 1 is 2
step = 0.01        # Resolution of search
candidates = []

# Enumerate over real parts
re_min, re_max = -threshold_real, threshold_real
re = re_min

while re <= re_max:
    # For each real part, calculate the possible imaginary parts that satisfy the distance to 1
    # dist(z,1)=2 => |z - 1|=2 => (re - 1)^2 + im^2 = 4
    # So, im^2 = 4 - (re - 1)^2
    delta = 4 - (re - 1)**2
    if delta < 0:
        re += step
        continue
    im_candidates = [math.sqrt(delta), -math.sqrt(delta)] if delta >= 0 else []

    for im in im_candidates:
        z = complex(re, im)
        # Check second distance condition: dist(z^2, 1)=6
        z_sq = z**2
        dist_z2_1 = abs(z_sq - 1)
        if abs(dist_z2_1 - 6) < 1e-6:
            print(f"Candidate z: {z} with Re: {re}")  # Stream results
            candidates.append(re)

# Output the collected real parts as potential answer(s)
if candidates:
    min_re = min(candidates)
    print(f"Possible real part of z: {min_re}")
else:
    print("No candidates found within bounds.")
```
