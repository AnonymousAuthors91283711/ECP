abbrev omnimath3264_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3264 (n : ℕ) (h : 0 < n) :
  (∀ m, Nat.Coprime m n → ∃ π : Equiv.Perm (Fin n), ∀ k, π (π k) ≡ m * k [MOD n]) ↔ n ∈ omnimath3264_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: timeout triggered. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests the set includes values of n for which such permutations exist; this is known for n being prime, as multiplication by m modulo n induces a permutation iff m is coprime to n.
