This problem involves identifying the greatest value of `n` such that there exists an `m` satisfying the conditions in `P`. The predicate `P` is given as: `m > 0`, `n > 0`, and `(m + n) / 2 = 5`. 

Rewriting `(m + n) / 2 = 5` gives `m + n = 10`. Since `m` and `n` are natural numbers greater than 0, valid `m` and `n` satisfy:
- `m + n = 10`
- `m > 0`
- `n > 0`

To find the greatest `n` for which such an `m` exists, enumerate all positive `m` from 1 up to 9 (excluding 10 because that would make `m` zero) and compute corresponding `n`. We want the maximum of these `n`.

```python
# Enumerate all positive m, find corresponding n, and track the maximum n
max_n = 0
for m in range(1, 10):
    n = 10 - m
    if n > 0:
        print(n)  # stream answer when found
        if n > max_n:
            max_n = n
print("Answer:", max_n)
```
