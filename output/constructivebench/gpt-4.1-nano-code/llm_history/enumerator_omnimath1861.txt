The problem appears to involve probability and combinatorics, specifically counting pairs of students related to multiples from a set. To enumerate possible rational answers, I will systematically compute the sums involved and output the ratio. Since the sums depend on small sets, I'll generate candidate ratios by directly calculating the sums without assumptions.

```python
# Enumerate all possible sums for the given sets to understand the ratio
students = 36
multiples = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

# Compute total number of pairs (student pairs)
total_pairs = students * students

# Compute sum of squares of the multiples (sameMultiplePairs)
same_multiple_pairs = sum(k * k for k in multiples)

# Compute sum of the multiples (samePersonPairs)
sum_multiples = sum(multiples)

# Calculate the ratio of samePersonPairs / sameMultiplePairs
ratio = sum_multiples / same_multiple_pairs

# Output the ratio as an exact rational
print(f"{sum_multiples} / {same_multiple_pairs} = {ratio}")

# For a more explicit enumeration: list all candidate ratios with denominators up to 100
from fractions import Fraction
for denom in range(1, 101):
    for num in range(1, int(ratio * denom) + 1):
        candidate = Fraction(num, denom)
        # Check if candidate approximates the ratio
        if abs(candidate - ratio) < 1e-9:
            print(f"Candidate ratio: {candidate}")
```
