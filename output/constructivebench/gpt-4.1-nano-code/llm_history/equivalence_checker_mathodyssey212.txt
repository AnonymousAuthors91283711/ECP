abbrev mathodyssey212_answer : ℝ × ℝ := sorry
theorem mathodyssey212 : 
  (logb 4 (1/64) = mathodyssey212_answer.1) ∧ (logb 5 625 = mathodyssey212_answer.2) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: (-3, 4)
Proposed Answer: (-6, 4)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. For log₄(1/64):
   - 1/64 can be written as 4⁻³ since 4³ = 64
   - Therefore log₄(1/64) = log₄(4⁻³) = -3
   - Ground truth shows -3 (correct)
   - Proposed answer shows -6 (incorrect)

2. For log₅(625):
   - 625 is 5⁴
   - Therefore log₅(625) = log₅(5⁴) = 4
   - Both ground truth and proposed answer show 4 (correct)

The proposed answer is incorrect for the first part but correct for the second part.

<<<False>>>
