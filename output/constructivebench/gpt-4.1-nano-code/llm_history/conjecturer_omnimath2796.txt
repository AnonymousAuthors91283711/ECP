theorem omnimath2796 :
  ∃ p q : ℝ, (∀ r : ℝ, (∃ x₁ x₂ : ℝ, x₁ ≠ x₂ ∧ x₁ < 0 ∧ x₂ < 0 ∧ x₁ * x₂ = r + 87 ∧ x₁ + x₂ = r + 7) ↔ p < r ∧ r < q) ∧
  p^2 + q^2 = omnimath2796_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 1205. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the pattern and the enumeration hint, the answer likely involves the quadratic roots structure with parameters 7 and 87. The key values are the roots of `x² - (r + 7) x + (r + 87) = 0`, which depend linearly on r. The interval described suggests these roots evolve from x₁ and x₂, bounded between p and q, and the sum of their squares at the critical point corresponds to a specific quadratic expression. 

The critical value appears to be the constant 1205, which is consistent with the sum of squares of the roots at the extremal conditions.

Therefore, the closed form expression for p² + q² matching the enumeration and problem structure is:

<<<1205>>>
