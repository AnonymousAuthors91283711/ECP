This problem appears to involve a combinatorial game with operations on lists of metals, and a property concerning adjacency. To explore potential answers, we will construct code to:
- Generate small values for \( n \) and \( k \),
- Simulate the operation `move_k_operation`,
- Check the adjacency property `at_most_one_adjacent_AC` after iterations,
- Search for minimal or maximum steps satisfying the property,
- Output potential values directly as they are discovered, aiding in conjecture development.

We prioritize simplicity and efficiency:
- Limit \( n \) to small values (e.g., 1, 2, 3) for tractability,
- Limit `steps` to a small range (say 0 to 10),
- For each configuration, verify the condition and print results immediately.

```python
# Small enumeration to explore possible values for n, k, and steps that satisfy the property
class Metal:
    A = 'A'
    C = 'C'

def move_k_operation(k, coins):
    idx = k - 1
    if idx < 0 or idx >= len(coins):
        return coins
    kth = coins[idx]
    left = coins[:idx]
    right = coins[idx+1:]
    left_subseq = []
    for c in reversed(left):
        if c == kth:
            left_subseq.append(c)
        else:
            break
    right_subseq = []
    for c in right:
        if c == kth:
            break
        right_subseq.append(c)
    max_subseq = list(reversed(left_subseq)) + [kth] + right_subseq
    remaining = [c for c in coins if c not in max_subseq]
    return max_subseq + remaining

def at_most_one_adjacent_AC(coins):
    if len(coins) <= 1:
        return True
    diff_pairs = sum(1 for a, b in zip(coins, coins[1:]) if a != b)
    return diff_pairs <= 1

# Explore small values for n, k, and steps
for n in range(1, 4):  # n = 1, 2, 3
    for k in range(1, 3):  # k = 1, 2
        initial_coins = [Metal.A, Metal.C] * n
        for steps in range(0, 11):
            coins = initial_coins[:]
            for _ in range(steps):
                coins = move_k_operation(k, coins)
            if at_most_one_adjacent_AC(coins):
                print(f"n={n}, k={k}, steps={steps}, coins={coins}")
```
