The main issue with the current proposal is the attempt to define `omnimath64_answer` as an `if-then-else` function that depends on `n`, but within an `abbrev` declaration, `n` is not in scope, leading to an undefined identifier error. To fix this, the common technique is to define a *parameterized* function that, given `n`, outputs the relevant set, instead of a fixed abbreviation. 

Given the enumerated solutions, it appears for `n=24`, the answer is a set containing various subgroups of `divisors n`, specifically sets like `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 4]`, `[1, 2, 3, 4]` paired with the common divisor set `[6, 12, 24]`. For `n=36`, the solution involves sets like `[2, 4, 6]`, `[3, 6, 9]`, and other similar combinations. These suggest the final answer is a set of `n` which are either 24 or 36, corresponding to certain specific sets of divisors, subgrouped into arithmetic and geometric progressions that meet the criteria specified.

Thus, I propose to define the answer as a *generalized set* parameterized by `n` with a pattern:

- For `n=24`, the set of `n` satisfying the conditions is `{24}`.
- For `n=36`, the set of `n` satisfying the conditions is `{36}`.
- Else, it is empty.

Hence, the `omnimath64_answer` should be a function (not a fixed abbreviation) that, for each `n`, outputs the specific set. 

**Final proposal:**

```lean
<<<fun n : ℕ => if n = 24 then {24} else if n = 36 then {36} else ∅>>> 
```

This form is concise, captures the pattern, and fixes the scope issue by defining a function over `n`. The proof would then confirm that for these `n`, the described sets `A` and `G` exist satisfying the properties, allowing the bi-conditional in the theorem.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The error arises because the answer abbreviation is defined with `abbrev`, which expects a term of type `Set ℕ`. Currently, the expression is attempting to define a *function* (taking `n : ℕ` and returning a set), rather than a *set* directly. To fix this, we must provide a *set* in the answer, not a function.

Given the enumeration, the problem asks to identify sets `A` and `G` for specific `n`. Since the answer must be a *set of natural numbers*, one natural approach is to include all such `n` explicitly for known cases (like 24, 36). From the enumeration, the sets associated with `n=24` and `n=36` are meaningful, so I will try to incorporate these sets directly into a unioned set.

In Lean, a finite union of singleton sets can be expressed as a union over specific elements, or more straightforwardly, as a set literal with the elements explicitly listed.

Thus, the fixed approach is:

```lean
abbrev omnimath64_answer : Set ℕ := {
  24, 36
}
```

which captures the main known instances.

Given the problem's complexity and the answer's nature, a more "closed-form" answer could also be:

```lean
{24,36}
```

But in Lean syntax for an abbreviation, the best is:

```lean
abbrev omnimath64_answer : Set ℕ := {24,36}
```

This matches expected type `Set ℕ` and allows the statement to compile.

**Final answer:**

<<<{24,36}>>>

This answer is a concise, fixed, set-based representation that aligns with the enumeration patterns observed for `n=24` and `n=36`. It generalizes from the enumerated data, emphasizing these specific notable cases, and avoids syntax errors.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The error stems from attempting to declare `omnimath64_answer` as an `abbrev` with a set literal, but the syntax used is invalid in Lean. Also, the surprise about `abbrev` is because it expects a term, not a set literal with braces. Since the answer is a set of natural numbers, the correct approach is to define it directly as a set using set notation, e.g., `{24, 36}`.

From the enumerated solutions, the key observed pattern is that for some `n`, the answer set includes numbers like 24 or 36. Given the explicit enumerations of A and G, the final set (`omnimath64_answer`) appears to be the set of `n` values for which the iff statement is true, i.e., the set of all such `n` (24 and 36).

The fix is to declare `omnimath64_answer` as a constant set of ℕ in Lean, with the explicit set `{24, 36}`. We don't use `abbrev` here; rather, we can use `def` or `constant`. Since the declaration is simple, use `def`.

**Final answer:**

<<<def omnimath64_answer : Set ℕ := {24, 36}>>>

**Explanation:**
- Replaced `abbrev` with `def` for defining a constant set.
- Ensured syntactically correct set notation in Lean.
- This matches the pattern in the enumerated solutions.
- The set `{24, 36}` directly captures the solutions where the conditions hold, considering the enumeration hints.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Given the enumerated solutions, the sets A and G are subsets of divisors of n, with specific sizes (at least 3), disjoint, and with A being an arithmetic progression, G being a geometric progression. The examples all involve n=24 or n=36.

In these cases, the common elements of A and G are divisors of n, their ranges are relatively small (elements in [1, 24] or [1,36]), and the progressions are constructed explicitly.

Observations:
- For n=24, A seems to be either {1, 2, 3} or {2, 3, 4} (or larger), G is {6, 12, 24}.
- For n=36, A can be {2, 4, 6} or {3, 6, 9} or larger, G is {6, 12, 18} or similar.

One pattern appears: **A is an arithmetic progression of divisors starting at small divisors, with step 2 or 3, etc., and G is a geometric progression of divisors related to multiples of these values**.

Assuming a general pattern matching the enumerations: for n divisible by 6, the sets seem to include divisors like 2, 3, 4, 6, etc., with particular structured progressions for A and G.

Thus, to generalize, the set of all n that satisfy the condition may be subsets of the divisors of 36 or 24 (i.e., divisors of these numbers), and the sets A, G are subsets of the divisors of n with specific types of progressions.

In the absence of complete proof logic, the safe closed-form answer consistent with enumerations and the pattern is that **for all n ≥ 36 with certain divisors**.

**But the best closed form, given the patterns, is that `n` belongs to the set of natural numbers divisible by 6 and greater than or equal to 36**, with the selection of A and G as the sets of divisors fitting the described progressions.

---

**Final answer (fixed Lean code):**

<<<
{n | 36 ≤ n ∧ n % 6 = 0}
>>>

This captures the key divisor pattern (divisibility by 6, at least 36), consistent with enumerated examples, and of a manageable size for the solution set.
