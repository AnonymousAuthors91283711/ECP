This problem involves solving a system of two equations in \(\mathbb{R}^2\):

\[
\begin{cases}
p_1^2 - p_1 p_2 + 8 = 0 \\
p_1^2 - 8 p_1 + p_2 = 0
\end{cases}
\]

Our goal is to find all solutions \((p_1, p_2)\). Let's analyze:

From the second equation: \( p_2 = 8 p_1 - p_1^2 \).

Substitute into the first:

\[
p_1^2 - p_1 (8 p_1 - p_1^2) + 8 = 0
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
p_1^2 - 8 p_1^2 + p_1^3 + 8 = 0 \Rightarrow p_1^3 - 7 p_1^2 + 8 = 0
\]

Now, we'll implement a brute-force iteration over a small range of rational or integer candidates for \(p_1\), find roots of the cubic in that range, and compute corresponding \(p_2\).

Let's proceed with this analysis.

```python
# Enumerate possible p1 values, look for rational roots of cubic p1^3 - 7 p1^2 + 8 = 0
# Candidate integer values in a reasonable range (-10 to 10)
for p1 in range(-10, 11):
    # Check if p1 satisfies the cubic exactly
    if p1**3 - 7 * p1**2 + 8 == 0:
        p2 = 8 * p1 - p1**2
        print((p1, p2))
```
