    P 210 = omnimath3730_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate values for P(210): []. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
Given the periodicity of P and the additive sum constraints, the value P 210 is influenced by the known values at specific indices. P is defined on a finite cyclic group mod 268, with the sum over a range giving 75, and specific values provided. The pattern suggests P is constant or varies linearly but constrained by these sum conditions. The consistent value aligned with the sum and known points is 3, matching the pattern of known P-values and their sums.
