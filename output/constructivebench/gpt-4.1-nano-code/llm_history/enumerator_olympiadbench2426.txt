This problem involves establishing a relationship between train speed \(v\), the passing interval, train departure intervals, and Linh's passing time. To assist conjecture, we'll write a Python script to explore possible positive values of \(v\) that satisfy an approximate version of the key relation:

\[
\text{passing_interval} \approx \frac{\text{train_distance}}{\text{relative_speed}}
\]
where:
- train_interval = 3/60 hours
- passing_interval = 10/60 hours
- train_distance = v * train_interval
- relative_speed = v - 60

We'll iterate over plausible values of \(v\) (from just above 60, since relative_speed must be positive, to a reasonable upper limit), check if the relation holds approximately, and print the candidates.

```python
# Parameters
train_interval = 3 / 60  # hours
passing_interval = 10 / 60  # hours
linh_speed = 60  # km/h

# Search range for train speed v > linh_speed
lower_bound = 60.1
upper_bound = 120
step = 0.01

for v in [lower_bound + i * step for i in range(int((upper_bound - lower_bound) / step) + 1)]:
    relative_speed = v - linh_speed
    train_distance = v * train_interval
    # Compute passing time based on assumed relation
    passing_time_estimate = train_distance / relative_speed
    # Check if close to passing_interval (within a small tolerance)
    if abs(passing_time_estimate - passing_interval) < 0.0005:
        print(f"Found candidate v: {v:.2f} km/h (relative speed: {relative_speed:.2f}, passing time: {passing_time_estimate:.4f})")
```
