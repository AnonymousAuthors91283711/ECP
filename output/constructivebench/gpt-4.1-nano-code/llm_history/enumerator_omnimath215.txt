The problem involves finding an expression for the quantity

\[
\frac{x^8 + y^8}{x^8 - y^8} - \frac{x^8 - y^8}{x^8 + y^8}
\]

based on the given relation

\[
\frac{x^2 + y^2}{x^2 - y^2} + \frac{x^2 - y^2}{x^2 + y^2} = k.
\]

To analyze this, it's practical to explore specific values of \( x \) and \( y \) to observe the pattern and infer the formula for the answer in terms of \(k\).

The code tests various ratios \( r = y / x \), simplifies the expressions, and attempts to find the relation between the initial sum \(k\) and the target expression.

```python
import math

# Function to compute the sum involving x^2 and y^2
def sum_k(x, y):
    return (x**2 + y**2) / (x**2 - y**2) + (x**2 - y**2) / (x**2 + y**2)

# Function to compute the target expression involving x^8 and y^8
def expression(x, y):
    numerator = (x**8 + y**8) / (x**8 - y**8)
    subtrahend = (x**8 - y**8) / (x**8 + y**8)
    return numerator - subtrahend

# Exploring ratios to find relation
ratios = [0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10]
for r in ratios:
    # Choose x = 1, y = r
    x = 1.0
    y = r
    sum_val = sum_k(x, y)
    expr_val = expression(x, y)
    print(f"ratio y/x = {r}")
    print(f"Sum k = {sum_val}")
    print(f"Expression value = {expr_val}\n")
```
