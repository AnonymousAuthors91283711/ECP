// To approach this problem, we want to find positive integers a, b, c, d such that:
// a! * b! * c! = d!
// and a + b + c + d = 37.
// Since factorials grow rapidly, we can iterate over possible values for d (say from 4 to 36)
// and for each d, search for triplets (a, b, c) with positive integers less than or equal to d.
// We check if a! * b! * c! equals d!, and sum constraints hold.

```python
import math

# Set maximum d based on factorial growth; d can't be larger than 36 for a realistic search
max_d = 36

# Store the answer
answers = []

for d in range(4, max_d + 1):
    d_fact = math.factorial(d)
    # To limit search space, consider a, b, c from 1 to d
    for a in range(1, d):
        a_fact = math.factorial(a)
        for b in range(1, d):
            b_fact = math.factorial(b)
            for c in range(1, d):
                c_fact = math.factorial(c)
                # Check if a! * b! * c! == d!
                if a_fact * b_fact * c_fact == d_fact:
                    total_sum = a + b + c + d
                    if total_sum == 37:
                        answer = (a, b, c, d)
                        # Compute the product, per the problem's answer assignment
                        product = a * b * c * d
                        print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, product={product}")
                        answers.append(product)
                        # Since the problem might have multiple solutions, we can continue searching
                        
# For the purpose of the demonstration, you could consider printing answers if needed.
# But per instructions, only print solutions when found.
