This problem involves finding all functions \(f:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) satisfying the functional equation:

\[
\gcd(fx, y) \times f(xy) = f(x) \times f(y)
\]

for all positive integers \(x, y\).

Given the context and the structure, typical solutions often involve multiplicative functions or functions with some divisor-related properties.

I will choose some small sample values of \(x\) and \(y\) to analyze possible solutions, and then perform enumeration over potential functions. We'll consider constant functions and functions of the form \(f(n) = n^k\), as these often appear in such equations.

Since the problem asks for all solutions that satisfy the property for all positive integers, I will specifically test small candidate functions such as \(f(n) = n\), \(f(n) = 1\), \(f(n) = n^k\), etc., and verify their validity.

Below is the Python code that enumerates such candidate functions and checks the functional equation for small values of \(x, y \leq 5\):

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions f: N -> N
# to find all functions satisfying: gcd(f(x), y) * f(x*y) == f(x) * f(y) for small x,y
# Focus on simple forms: constant, identity, monomials

import math

# Define small candidate functions
def constant(c):
    return lambda n: c

def identity(n):
    return n

def power(k):
    return lambda n: n**k

# List candidate functions with their description
candidates = [
    ("const_1", constant(1)),
    ("const_2", constant(2)),
    ("identity", identity),
    ("square", power(2)),
    ("cube", power(3))
]

# Check validity over small x,y
max_x_y = 5

for name, f in candidates:
    valid = True
    for x in range(1, max_x_y + 1):
        for y in range(1, max_x_y + 1):
            lhs = math.gcd(f(x), y) * f(x*y)
            rhs = f(x) * f(y)
            if lhs != rhs:
                valid = False
                break
        if not valid:
            break
    if valid:
        print(f"Candidate function: {name}")
        # For found valid candidates, print some sample outputs
        for n in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
            print(f"{name}({n}) = {f(n)}")
```
