theorem omnimath3405 (x : ℤ) (h : Even (3 * x + 1)) : 
  Odd (omnimath3405_answer x) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 7 * x + 4
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℤ => (3 * x + 1) * ((3 * x + 1) ^ 2)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
- We need to find a function f: ℤ → ℤ such that for all integers x where 3x+1 is even, f(x) is odd.
- The ground truth answer is f(x) = 7x + 4
- The proposed answer is f(x) = (3x+1)^3

Evaluation:
1. Ground truth answer:
   - When 3x+1 is even, x must be odd (since 3*odd+1 = even, 3*even+1 = odd)
   - For odd x: 7x is odd (7*odd=odd), +4 makes it odd+even=odd
   - Correctly satisfies the condition

2. Proposed answer:
   - f(x) = (3x+1)^3
   - When 3x+1 is even, any power of it remains even
   - But we need the result to be odd, not even
   - Therefore, the proposed answer fails the condition

The proposed answer actually gives an even output when the condition requires odd output, which is exactly the opposite of what we need.
