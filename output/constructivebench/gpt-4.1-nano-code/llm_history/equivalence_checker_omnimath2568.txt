open Set Function Nat

abbrev omnimath2568_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2568 : 
  Infinite omnimath2568_answer ∧ ∀ a ∈ omnimath2568_answer, ∀ b ∈ omnimath2568_answer, a < b → Squarefree (a + b) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: sorry  -- The actual construction is non-trivial
Proposed Answer: { n : ℕ | n = 1 ∨ n = 2 ∨ (∃ k : ℕ, n = 4 * k + 1) ∧ (n ≠ 25) }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer provides a construction that is mostly correct but has some issues:
1. It correctly includes numbers ≡1 mod 4 (which are likely to satisfy the squarefree condition when added to other numbers in the set)
2. It excludes 25 (which is good since 25 is a square)
3. However, it's missing some constraints:
   - The condition should ensure that for any two numbers a < b in the set, a+b is squarefree
   - The current construction might still allow pairs where a+b is not squarefree (e.g., 1+8=9)
   - The infinite condition is satisfied, but the squarefree condition isn't fully guaranteed

The answer is close but not fully correct as it doesn't completely satisfy the squarefree condition for all pairs.
