The problem appears to be a functional equation involving a sequence \(a: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}\), with a certain relation involving sums and differences, and a initial condition \(a(1) = 3\). Our goal is to find \(a(2004)\) based on these conditions, likely by conjecturing the form of \(a(n)\).

Since the original code is in Lean and references a functional equation with a symmetry, a natural approach is to look for solutions of \(a(n)\) of a polynomial or simple functional form. We will:
- Test for simple polynomial solutions (constant, linear, quadratic).
- Use the given equation to determine parameters.
- Since \(a(1) = 3\), this constrains the solution.

We will:
- assume \(a(n) = c \cdot n + d\),
- test the relation for small values to derive constants,
- then compute \(a(2004)\).

```python
# The code tests linear solutions of the form a(n) = c*n + d,
# using the functional relation to find c and d, and then computes a(2004).

# Define a function to test the relation for a given c, d, n
def test_relation(c, d, n):
    m = n  # test with m = n for simplicity since the relation involves m â‰¥ n
    # For m = n, the relation simplifies as m - n = 0
    m_plus_n = m + n
    a_m_plus_n = c * (m + n) + d
    a_m_minus_n = c * (m - n) + d
    lhs = a_m_plus_n + a_m_minus_n - m + n - 1
    
    a_2m = c * (2 * m) + d
    a_2n = c * (2 * n) + d
    rhs = 0.5 * (a_2m + a_2n)
    return abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-8

# Since we know a(1) = 3, d = 3 - c * 1
# Try values of c to see if relation holds
candidate_solutions = []

for c in [1, 2, 3, 0.5, -1]:
    d = 3 - c*1
    # verify relation for multiple n, say n=1, 2, 3
    if all(test_relation(c, d, n) for n in [1, 2, 3]):
        candidate_solutions.append((c, d))

# Now, compute a(2004) for each candidate solution
answers = []
for c, d in candidate_solutions:
    a_2004 = c * 2004 + d
    answers.append(a_2004)
    print(f"Found candidate with c={c}, d={d}, a(2004)={a_2004}")

# Output the results
# The expected answer will be based on these candidate solutions.
# Since the problem is abstract, we just print candidate results.
