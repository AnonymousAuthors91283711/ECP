The problem seems to involve finding the smallest number `k` such that the following property holds for any finite set `V` with 2016 elements, endomorphism `E`, and an injective function `E`. The statement involves some form of partitioning (via `P : V → Fin k`) that distinguishes elements under the iteration of `E` to a certain depth (`n ≤ 28`). It's akin to a combinatorial or dynamical systems problem, likely related to complex properties of injective maps and partitions.

Given the complexity, a plausible approach is to:

- Test small values of `k` starting from 1 upwards.
- For each `k`, check if such a partition `P` can exist, considering the maximal number of possible partitions (i.e., `k^|V|`, but many will be impossible).
- Since the set size is fixed at 2016, and for each `k`, we need to verify the property over all endomorphisms `E`, we use combinatorial bounds and known lemmas: for a high number of `V`, large `k` may be necessary, and small `k` unlikely.

To implement efficiently, we assume small `k` samples and check hypothetical properties.

Below is an example code that enumerates small `k` values, prints them, and checks for the smallest `k` satisfying some bounds (approximating the concept).

```python
# We'll assume the minimal k is at least 1 and go up to a certain small threshold, e.g., 10
# For each k, output the candidate and whether it could satisfy the conditions,
# based on combinatorial reasoning.

max_k = 10
n = 2016
max_n = 28

for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
    # Approximate the number of distinct partitions P: V -> Fin k
    # which is k^n, but too large for actual enumeration, so we check bounds.
    # For the purpose of the enumeration, we'll only print small k.
    print(f"Trying k={k}")
    
    # The number of partitions is k^n, which can be huge. We check if k is sufficient
    # by rough bounds: for example, if k^n < number of elements squared, it's unlikely to distinguish them sufficiently
    # so we use some heuristic thresholds.
    estimated_partitions = k ** n
    
    # Since enumerating all is impossible, we use the heuristic:
    # if k^n >= 2016, potentially could distinguish elements,
    # otherwise, likely not.
    if estimated_partitions >= 2016:
        answer = k
        print(f"Found candidate k={k} sufficient for the partitioning constraints.")
        break

print(f"Minimal k satisfying the constraints is approximately {answer}.")
```
