theorem P2004AMCA_16 : 
  IsLeast {c : ℝ | ∀ x, x > c → ∃ (y : ℝ), y^2002 = x - 2001^2002} P2004AMCA_16_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 2001^{2002}. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The problem asks for the least c such that for all x > c, there exists y with y^2002 = x - 2001^2002. Since the function y ↦ y^2002 covers all y^2002 ≥ 0, the minimal x ensuring this is when y^2002 approaches 0, i.e., x approaches 2001^{2002}. Therefore, the minimal such c is 2001^{2002}.  
Answer: <<<2001 ^ 2002>>>
