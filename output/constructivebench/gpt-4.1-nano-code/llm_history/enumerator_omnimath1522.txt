This problem involves the Fibonacci sequence and partitions of the sum of its terms, specifically how to partition the first 15 Fibonacci numbers into two groups with equal sum. We need to find the number of such partitions, which is related to the sums of the Fibonacci sequence and the patterns of choosing subsets.

The key insight:
- The Fibonacci sequence is defined with F0=0, F1=1, F(i)=F(i-1)+F(i-2).
- We consider subsets p of indices {0,...,14} (since `Fin 15` has 15 elements).
- For a subset p, sum the corresponding w i = F(i+2); the sum over such a subset equals the sum over its complement if and only if sum of all w i (i=0..14) is even and the subset sums to half of total.

We will:
- Generate Fibonacci numbers F(2) to F(16) because w i = F(i+2).
- Calculate total sum.
- Check for subsets with sum exactly half of total (only when total is even).
- Count how many such subsets exist: this is the answer.

We will enumerate all subsets using bitmasks and count those with sum equal to half of the total sum.

```python
# Generate Fibonacci numbers up to F(16)
fib = [0, 1]
for _ in range(2, 17):
    fib.append(fib[-1] + fib[-2])
# Compute weights w_i = F(i+2)
w = [fib[i+2] for i in range(15)]
total_sum = sum(w)
answer = 0

# If total sum is odd, no such partition exists
if total_sum % 2 != 0:
    print(0)  # directly no partition
else:
    half = total_sum // 2
    # Enumerate all subsets
    for mask in range(1 << 15):
        subset_sum = 0
        for i in range(15):
            if (mask & (1 << i)) != 0:
                subset_sum += w[i]
        if subset_sum == half:
            answer += 1
            print(answer)
print("Total partitions with equal sum:", answer)
```
