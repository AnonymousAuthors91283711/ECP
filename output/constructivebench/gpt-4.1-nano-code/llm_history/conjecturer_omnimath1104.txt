The pattern in the enumerated answers suggests that the difference between uparrow a 6 and uparrow a 7 modulo n occurs when n divides uparrow a 6. Since uparrow a 6 is a power tower of height 6 with base a, for the smallest such n, a=2 yields the number 2^64, which is divisible only by powers of 2. Therefore, the least n must be 2^64. 

<<<2^64>>>
