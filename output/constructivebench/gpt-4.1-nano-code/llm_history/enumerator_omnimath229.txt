This problem involves a functional equation with constraints over all real numbers. While the actual solution to this lemma in Lean's Mathlib is complex, the key task here is to explore potential solutions to the given equation:

\[ (f(x) + x y)f(x - 3 y) + (f y + x y)f(3 x - y) = (f(x + y))^2 \]

We will attempt to find candidate functions that satisfy the equation by testing simple functions like constant, linear, and quadratic functions over small parameter ranges. Since the problem asks to enumerate solutions, we'll generate candidate functions with specific parameters and check if they satisfy the equation for some sample points.

Let's choose:
- Constant functions: \(f(x) = c\)
- Linear functions: \(f(x) = a x + b\)
- Quadratic functions: \(f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c\)

We'll test these for small parameters and approximate solutions over sample points \(x,y \in \{-1, 0, 1\}\).

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions: constant, linear, quadratic
# Test over small sample points to check if they satisfy the functional equation
# For efficiency, only verify the equation at points (-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, -1)

# List of sample points
points = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, -1)]

# Helper to evaluate the functional equation at given x,y with candidate function f
def verify_function(f, x, y):
    lhs = (f(x) + x * y) * f(x - 3 * y) + (f(y) + x * y) * f(3 * x - y)
    rhs = (f(x + y)) ** 2
    return abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-6  # allow small numerical tolerance

    if all(verify_function(lambda x: c, x, y) for x, y in points):
        print(f"Constant function candidate: f(x) = {c}")

# 2. Linear functions: f(x) = a*x + b
for a in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    for b in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:

        if all(verify_function(f_lin, x, y) for x, y in points):
            print(f"Linear function candidate: f(x) = {a}*x + {b}")

# 3. Quadratic functions: f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c

                print(f"Quadratic function candidate: f(x) = {a}*x^2 + {b}*x + {c}")
