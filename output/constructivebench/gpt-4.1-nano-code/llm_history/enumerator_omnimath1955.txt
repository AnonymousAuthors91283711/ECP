The problem appears to involve finding the smallest natural number \( n \) such that the fractional part of \(\sqrt{n}^{1/4}\) (the fourth root of \( n \)) is between 0 and \(\frac{1}{2015}\). In other words, we are seeking the minimal \( n \) where:

\[ 0 < (\sqrt{n})^{1/4} - \lfloor (\sqrt{n})^{1/4} \rfloor < \frac{1}{2015} \]

This can be simplified to:

- Consider \( x = (\sqrt{n})^{1/4} \)
- Then \( n = (\text{something}) \) such that fractional part of \( x \) is small

Since \( (\sqrt{n})^{1/4} = n^{1/8} \), the problem reduces to finding the least \( n \) so that the fractional part of \( n^{1/8} \) is positive but less than \( \frac{1}{2015} \).

To find such \( n \), we can enumerate \( n^{1/8} \) for small \( n \), check if the fractional part meets the criteria, and keep track of the least \( n \).

Here's the code:

```python
import math

# Define the tolerance
eps = 1 / 2015

# Initialize variable to store the minimal n satisfying the condition
minimal_n = None

# Set an upper bound for enumeration; adjust if needed
upper_bound = 10**8  # for efficiency, we choose a reasonable range

for n in range(1, upper_bound):
    root = n ** (1/8)
    fractional_part = root - math.floor(root)
    if 0 < fractional_part < eps:
        print(f"Candidate n: {n}, 8th root: {root}, fractional part: {fractional_part}")
        if minimal_n is None or n < minimal_n:
            minimal_n = n
        # Since we search in increasing order, the first found is minimal
        break

print(f"Minimal n satisfying the condition: {minimal_n}")
```
