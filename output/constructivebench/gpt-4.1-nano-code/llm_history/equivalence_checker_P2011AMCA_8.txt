Ground Truth Answer: 25
Proposed Answer: 20
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. We have 8 variables (A-H) and 6 equations plus one given value (C=5).
2. From h1: A + B + 5 = 30 => A + B = 25
3. From h2: B + 5 + D = 30 => B + D = 25
4. From h3: 5 + D + E = 30 => D + E = 25
5. From h4: D + E + F = 30, but D + E = 25 => F = 5
6. From h5: E + 5 + G = 30 => E + G = 25
7. From h6: 5 + G + H = 30 => G + H = 25

Now we can express everything in terms of B:
From A + B = 25 => A = 25 - B
From B + D = 25 => D = 25 - B
From D + E = 25 => E = B
From E + G = 25 => G = 25 - B
From G + H = 25 => H = B

Now A + H = (25 - B) + B = 25

The ground truth answer is 25, while the proposed answer is 20. The correct answer is indeed 25 as shown by the derivation.
