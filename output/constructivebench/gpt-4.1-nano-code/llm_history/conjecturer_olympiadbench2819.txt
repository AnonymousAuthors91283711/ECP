abbrev olympiadbench2819_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2819 :
  let p : ℕ → ℚ := fun n => if n = 17 then 1/2 else if 1 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 16 then 1/32 else 0
  (∑ a in Finset.Icc 1 17, ∑ b in Finset.Icc 1 17, if a + b = 20 ∨ a + b = 12 then p a * p b else 0) = olympiadbench2819_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 0.0546875. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The pattern suggests the sum is dominated by pairs that satisfy \(a + b = 12\) or \(20\), with \(p a\) and \(p b\) mostly zero except at \(n=17\) with \(p 17 = 1/2\). The main contributions are when either \(a=17, b= (12 \text{ or } 20 - 17)\), but only for \(a=17, b= 5\) (since \(12-7=5\)), or \(a=17, b=3\) for the sum \(20\). Calculating these: contributions are \(p 17 * p 5 = (1/2)*(1/32) = 1/64\) and similarly for \(b=17, a=5\). Summing these contributions yields the total \(2 * (1/64) = 1/32\). As \(p\) is zero elsewhere, the total sum equals \(1/32\). 

Final answer:

<<<(1/32 : ℚ)>>>
