This problem models a grid navigation where moves alternate between horizontal (|x₁ - x₂|=1) and vertical (|y₁ - y₂|=k), with the starting point at (1,1). The main goal is to determine the number of reachable points under these move constraints for a specific k between 51 and 99.

Instead of solving symbolically, we'll empirically enumerate all reachable points for each k in a small sample range. The approach involves:
- Starting from (1,1).
- Alternating between horizontal and vertical moves.
- Limiting to grid bounds 1..100.
- Collecting all reachable points.

We'll choose a small k (e.g., 51) for the demonstration, but the code is designed to handle the entire range.

Maximizing efficiency:
- Use a BFS-like approach.
- Avoid duplicate state processing.
- Save and print each reachable point as soon as it is found.

```python
from collections import deque

def enumerate_reachable(k):
    max_coord = 100
    start = (1, 1)
    visited = set([start])
    queue = deque([(start, True)])  # True: horizontal move next, False: vertical move next

    # Directions for moves
    def neighbors(x, y, horiz):
        moves = []
        if horiz:
            # horizontal move: |x - x2|=1, y fixed
            for dx in [-1, 1]:
                x2 = x + dx
                if 1 <= x2 <= max_coord:
                    moves.append((x2, y))
        else:
            # vertical move: |y - y2|=k, x fixed
            for dy in [-k, k]:
                y2 = y + dy
                if 1 <= y2 <= max_coord:
                    moves.append((x, y2))
        return moves

    while queue:
        (x, y), horiz_next = queue.popleft()
        for nx, ny in neighbors(x, y, horiz_next):
            if (nx, ny) not in visited:
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                print((nx, ny))
                queue.append(((nx, ny), not horiz_next))
    return visited

# Example: enumerate reachable points for k=51 (a representative small sample)
reachable_points = enumerate_reachable(51)
print(f"Total reachable points for k=51: {len(reachable_points)}")
```
