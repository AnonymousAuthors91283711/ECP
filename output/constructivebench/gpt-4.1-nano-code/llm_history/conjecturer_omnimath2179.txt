. Enumerated Answers: 2400. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The error indicates that `finset.range` is not directly available in Mathlib, which is true because in Lean's Mathlib, `Finset.range` is accessed as `Finset.range`. Additionally, the syntax for product of sets is `Finset.product`, and the `.card` property is just `.card`. The current answer attempts to write `(finset.range 6).product (finset.range 6)` but it should be `Finset.product (Finset.range 6) (Finset.range 6)`.

The problem counts sets of size 3 with distinct elements where no two elements share the same first or second coordinate, i.e., they form a "matching" with no shared row or column in a 6x6 grid. The total is supposedly 2400 based on the enumeration, which guides us toward a combinatorial formula: choosing 3 distinct rows and 3 distinct columns, then permuting the 3 pairs in 3! ways.

This suggests the formula: 
- Choose 3 rows out of 6: `C(6,3)` 
- Choose 3 columns out of 6: `C(6,3)` 
- Permute the 3 elements in the 3x3 grid: `3!`

Putting this into a closed form in Lean:

\[
\binom{6}{3} \times \binom{6}{3} \times 3!
\]

In Lean, binomial coefficient is `Nat.grade (n, k)` or better using `Nat.choose n k`, and factorial as `Nat.factorial n`. 

Final answer:

<<<(Nat.choose 6 3) * (Nat.choose 6 3) * Nat.factorial 3>>>

This equals 20 * 20 * 6 = 2400, matching the enumerated answer.
