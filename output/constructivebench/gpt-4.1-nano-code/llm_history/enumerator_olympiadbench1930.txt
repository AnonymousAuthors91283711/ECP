The problem appears to involve finding all triples of positive integers `(a, b, c)` satisfying the equation:

\[ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a \times b \times c)^2 \]

Our goal is to enumerate possible solutions of `(a, b, c)` and possibly determine the set of all solutions. We want to generate all solutions with small `a, b, c` to find these triples.

Considering constraints:
- All are positive integers.
- To keep it efficient, limit enumeration to small bounds, say from 1 to 20.
- For each combination, verify the equation and print solutions immediately.

We'll write a Python script to enumerate triples `(a, b, c)` with small bounds and output solutions as we find them.

```python
# Enumerate small positive integer solutions for the equation:
# a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a * b * c)^2
# Limits set to 20 for computational feasibility and potential solutions.
# Prints each valid solution immediately upon discovery.

for a in range(1, 21):
    for b in range(1, 21):
        for c in range(1, 21):
            lhs = a**3 + b**3 + c**3
            rhs = (a * b * c)**2
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"Solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
```
