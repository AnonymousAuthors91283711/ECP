Given the constraint that \(k^2\) divides \(12!\), and the sum of the exponents in the factorization, the maximum \(s\) corresponds to the sum of the exponents in the largest perfect square dividing \(12!\). The largest \(k\) satisfying \(k^2 \mid 12!\) is obtained when \(k^2\) is the highest perfect square divisor, which is \(2^8 \times 3^4 \times 5^2 \times 7^2\). The sum of exponents in this factorization is \(8 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 16\). Thus, the maximum sum of exponents is 16.

<<<16>>>
