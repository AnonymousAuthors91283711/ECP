The problem involves finding the minimal number of distinct sums formed by pairs of entries from an increasing sequence with specified boundary conditions. Specifically, for each `n >= 2`, we need to find the least `k` such that there exists a strictly monotonic function `a` satisfying `a 0 = 0` and `a n = 2 * n - 1`, where the number of distinct sums `a i + a j` over all pairs `(i, j)` with `i, j â‰¤ n` is exactly `k`.

To assist in conjecturing, we'll generate candidate sequences `a` with these boundary conditions, test their pairwise sums, and record the number of distinct sums.

We'll implement a brute-force search over small increasing sequences that meet boundary conditions, compute their pairwise sums, and record the minimal number of distinct sums observed. For simplicity and efficiency, we'll limit to sequences with small step sizes to exemplify potential minimal sum counts.

```python
import itertools

def generate_sequences(n, start=0, end=None, step=1):
    """Generate increasing sequences a with a0=0, a_n=2n-1, and a_i within a small range."""
    if end is None:
        end = 2*n  # limit range to keep computations small
    # Generate sequences with boundary conditions
    # a0=0 and a_n=2n-1, fill the middle with small steps
    for middle in itertools.product(range(step, end), repeat=n-1):
        seq = [0] + list(middle)
        seq.append(2*n - 1)
        if all(seq[i] < seq[i+1] for i in range(n)):
            yield seq

n = 4  # choose small n for demonstration
minimal_k = None

print(f"Testing sequences for n={n} with boundary conditions a0=0, a{n}={2*n-1}")
for seq in generate_sequences(n):
    sums = set()
    for i in range(n+1):
        for j in range(n+1):
            sums.add(seq[i] + seq[j])
    k = len(sums)
    print(f"Sequence: {seq} -> distinct sums: {k}")
    if minimal_k is None or k < minimal_k:
        minimal_k = k

print(f"Minimal number of distinct sums found: {minimal_k}")
```
