Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: (7, 49)
Let me analyze this problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem asks for real numbers a and b such that:
   - There exists a complex cube root of 343 (which is 7³) that is not real
   - This complex root satisfies the quadratic equation z² + a z + b = 0
   - The pair (a,b) is unique for this property

2. The complex cube roots of 343 are:
   - 7 (real)
   - 7ω and 7ω² (complex, where ω = e^(2πi/3))

3. For the non-real roots, we can use either 7ω or 7ω² since they're complex conjugates. Let's take z = 7ω.

4. The minimal polynomial for ω is x² + x + 1, so:
   ω² = -ω - 1

5. The quadratic equation must satisfy:
   (7ω)² + a(7ω) + b = 0
   49ω² + 7aω + b = 0
   49(-ω - 1) + 7aω + b = 0
   (-49 + 7a)ω + (-49 + b) = 0

6. This gives us two equations:
   -49 + 7a = 0 → a = 7
   -49 + b = 0 → b = 49

7. Therefore, the correct answer is indeed (7, 49).
