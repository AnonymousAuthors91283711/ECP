The problem appears to be about finding the least value of |x - 1| where x belongs to a specific finite set of real numbers. The set given is {11/10, 111/100, 1.101, 1111/1000, 1.011}. We need to find the minimal distance from 1 to an element in this set, which can be done by computing the absolute differences.

The code below enumerates all candidates, computes their distances to 1, and finds the minimal value, then outputs all candidates with their distances to ensure completeness and streaming results.

```python
# Enumerate the given set of real numbers
numbers = [11/10, 111/100, 1.101, 1111/1000, 1.011]
target = 1

# Compute the absolute differences
differences = [(abs(x - target), x) for x in numbers]

# Find the minimal difference
min_diff = min(d[0] for d in differences)

# Print all candidates with their differences
for diff, x in differences:
    print(f"x = {x}, |x - 1| = {diff}")

print(f"Least |x - 1| is {min_diff}")
```
