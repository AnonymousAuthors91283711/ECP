  omnimath3149_answer (3, 1) (4, 2) = 14 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun (a, b) (c, d) => a * c + b * d
Proposed Answer: fun p q => p.fst * q.snd + p.snd * q.fst + 4
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem asks for a function that takes two pairs of natural numbers and returns a natural number, with the specific example that when given (3,1) and (4,2), it should return 14.

2. Ground Truth Answer: This correctly implements the dot product of two 2D vectors, which would indeed give 3*4 + 1*2 = 14 for the given example.

3. Proposed Answer: This has several issues:
   - It incorrectly swaps the components (using p.fst * q.snd instead of p.fst * q.fst)
   - It adds an arbitrary constant 4
   - While it happens to give 14 for the specific example (3*2 + 1*4 + 4 = 6 + 4 + 4 = 14), it's not correct for other inputs

The proposed answer only works for this specific case by coincidence due to the arbitrary addition of 4, but is not equivalent to the correct dot product function.
