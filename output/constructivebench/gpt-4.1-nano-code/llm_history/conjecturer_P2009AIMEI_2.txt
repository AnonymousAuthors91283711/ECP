Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the minimal n with imaginary part close to 164 occurs at n=1, where Im(z)=1.0, matching the enumerated answer.  
Additionally, since larger n produce enormous imaginary parts, and at n=1 the value matches the answer, the final answer is:  
<<<1>>>
This aligns with the pattern and provided data.
