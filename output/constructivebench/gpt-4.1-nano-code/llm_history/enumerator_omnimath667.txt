This problem involves finding two 5-element subsets `s` and `t` of `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}` with the same product, but with sums differing in parity. The key is to enumerate all pairs of 5-element subsets, check their products and sums, and find such a pair where sums' parity differs.

1. Generate all 5-element subsets of `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`.
2. For each pair, check if they have the same product.
3. Check if their sums have different parity (one even, one odd).
4. When such a pair is found, print the pair's product and the subsets.

This approach is feasible because the total number of 5-element subsets is small C(7,5)=21, making brute-force enumeration manageable.

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Generate all 5-element subsets of {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
elements = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
subsets = list(combinations(elements, 5))

# Store subsets as frozensets for easy comparison
subsets_fs = [frozenset(s) for s in subsets]

# Dictionary: product -> list of subsets with that product
product_map = {}

for s in subsets_fs:
    prod = 1
    for num in s:
        prod *= num
    product_map.setdefault(prod, []).append(s)

# Search for pairs with same product, different sum parity
found = False
for prod, subset_list in product_map.items():
    for i in range(len(subset_list)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(subset_list)):
            s1 = subset_list[i]
            s2 = subset_list[j]
            sum_s1 = sum(s1)
            sum_s2 = sum(s2)
            if (sum_s1 % 2) != (sum_s2 % 2):
                print(f"Product: {prod}")
                print(f"s = {sorted(s1)}, sum = {sum_s1} (parity {sum_s1%2})")
                print(f"t = {sorted(s2)}, sum = {sum_s2} (parity {sum_s2%2})")
                found = True
                break
        if found:
            break
    if found:
        break
```
