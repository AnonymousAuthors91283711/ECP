The problem appears to involve analyzing a determinant of an \( n \times n \) matrix where each entry is related to the count of solutions to a linear Diophantine equation \( p_1 i' + p_2 j' = n \) with \( p_1, p_2 \in \mathbb{N} \), and \( i' = i+1, j' = j+1 \). The key is to understand how these counts relate to known number-theoretic functions, and then to compute (or guess) the resulting determinants for small \( n \).

Since `Mathlib` and related code are in Lean, and I can only code in Python, I'll simulate the enumeration for small \( n \). The counts involve solutions to \( p_1 i' + p_2 j' = n \), with \( p_1, p_2 \ge 0 \).

For small \( n \), I will:
1. Generate the matrix entries by counting solutions.
2. Compute the determinant symbolically or exactly.
3. Enumerate results, focusing on small values to see a pattern.

Here's a Python script that enumerates \( n \), constructs the matrices, counts solutions, computes determinants, and outputs results.

```python
import math
import itertools

def count_solutions(n, i, j):
    # Counts solutions to p1*i' + p2*j' = n, p1,p2 >= 0
    i_prime = i + 1
    j_prime = j + 1
    count = 0
    for p1 in range(n // max(i_prime, 1) + 1):
        r = n - p1 * i_prime
        if r < 0:
            continue
        if j_prime != 0:
            if r % j_prime == 0:
                p2 = r // j_prime
                if p2 >= 0:
                    count += 1
    return count

def matrix_entries(n):
    # Build n x n matrix of counts
    mat = []
    for i in range(n):
        row = []
        for j in range(n):
            row.append(count_solutions(n, i, j))
        mat.append(row)
    return mat

def determinant(mat):
    # Compute determinant using recursive Laplace expansion for small matrices
    n = len(mat)
    if n == 1:
        return mat[0][0]
    if n == 2:
        return mat[0][0]*mat[1][1] - mat[0][1]*mat[1][0]
    det = 0
    for c in range(n):
        submat = [row[:c] + row[c+1:] for row in mat[1:]]
        sign = (-1) ** c
        det += sign * mat[0][c] * determinant(submat)
    return det

# Enumerate for small n
for n in range(1, 5):
    mat = matrix_entries(n)
    det_val = determinant(mat)
    print(f"n={n}, matrix={mat}, determinant={det_val}")
```
