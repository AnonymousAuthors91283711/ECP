Also possible with s = 399999. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The conundrum seeks the maximum value of s for a team score, given constraints on team size and sum. The enumeration indicates the highest possible score is 400000, which aligns with the maximum score per participant. Since a team score s satisfying ∃ p, team p = s and the constraints are maximized at the maximum individual score of 400000, the answer should be 400000.

. Enumerated Answers: Maximum team p score: 400000
Also possible with s = 399999. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The error arises because in Lean, an abbreviation (abbrev) must be assigned a value of a specific type—in this case, ℕ (natural number). However, using `fun _ => 400000` creates a function, which does not directly match ℕ. The current proposal attempts to define `P2008AMCB_3_answer` as a constant function rather than an explicit number, hence the type mismatch.

Given the problem context, the goal is to find the maximum possible team score `s`, with the constraints that each team member's score is at least 15000, the total sum does not exceed 700000, and there exists some team with a score exactly `s`. The enumeration suggests that the maximum answer is 400000, and another possible answer is 399999, indicating the maximum feasible score is 400000.

Since the maximum score can't necessarily be achieved when every participant has the minimum 15000 points (which sums up to at least 15000*number_of_participants), we want the highest `s` satisfying the constraints. The maximum is therefore 400000.

**Final Fix:** To be consistent with the expected type, I will set `P2008AMCB_3_answer` directly as a number, namely 400000.

**Final Answer:**

<<<400000>>>
