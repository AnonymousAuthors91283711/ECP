This problem involves defining a function τ(n) that counts the number of positive divisors of n, then examining the set of numbers n from 1 to 50 for which τ(τ(n)) is odd. To assist in conjecture, we will enumerate τ(n) and τ(τ(n)) for all n from 1 to 50, and identify those where τ(τ(n)) is odd.

Key points:
- τ(n) = number of positive divisors of n
- We need to check if τ(τ(n)) is odd
- Enumerate over n in [1, 50], compute τ(n), then τ(τ(n))
- Immediately print numbers where τ(τ(n)) is odd
- The entire process is efficient given the small range

```python
def divisor_count(n):
    count = 0
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % k == 0:
            count += 1
    return count

for n in range(1, 51):
    tau_n = divisor_count(n)
    tau_tau_n = divisor_count(tau_n)
    if tau_tau_n % 2 == 1:
        print(f"n={n}, τ(n)={tau_n}, τ(τ(n))={tau_tau_n}")
```

This code enumerates all n from 1 to 50, computes τ(n), then τ(τ(n)). It prints the n's that make τ(τ(n)) odd, aiding in understanding the pattern for the original problem.
