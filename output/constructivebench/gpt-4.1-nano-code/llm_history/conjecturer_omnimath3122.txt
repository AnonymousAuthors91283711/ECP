n = 1, s(n) = 39
n = 2, s(n) = 35
n = 3, s(n) = 31

n = 8, s(n) = 11
n = 9, s(n) = 7
n = 10, s(n) = 3
Total count: 11. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The positive values are for n = 0 to 10 (inclusive), as s(n) decreases by 4, starting from 43 until 3. When s(n) > 0, n ranges from 0 to 10, inclusive. That's 11 values total. 

Answer: <<<11>>>
