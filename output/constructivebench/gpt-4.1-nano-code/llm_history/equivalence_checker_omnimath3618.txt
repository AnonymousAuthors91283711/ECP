theorem omnimath3618 (p : ℝ[X]) :
    (∀ x : ℝ, eval x (X + C 10) * eval (2 * x) p = eval x (8 * X - C 32) * eval (x + 6) p) ∧
    eval 1 p = 210 ↔ p = omnimath3618_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2 * (X + C 4) * (X - C 4) * (X - C 8)
Proposed Answer: X^3 - 6 * X^2 + 15 * X - 10
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a polynomial p(x) that satisfies two conditions:
   - A functional equation involving p evaluated at different points
   - A specific value at x=1 (p(1)=210)

2. The ground truth answer is a factored form of a cubic polynomial: 2*(X+4)*(X-4)*(X-8)

3. The proposed answer is another cubic polynomial in expanded form: X³-6X²+15X-10

Let's check if they're equivalent:

- Expand the ground truth:
  2*(X+4)*(X-4)*(X-8) = 2*(X²-16)*(X-8) = 2*(X³-8X²-16X+128) = 2X³-16X²-32X+256

- Compare with proposed answer:
  X³-6X²+15X-10

These are clearly different polynomials. We can also check p(1):
- Ground truth: 2(1)-16(1)-32(1)+256 = 210 (matches condition)
- Proposed: 1-6+15-10 = 0 (doesn't match p(1)=210)

<<<False>>>
