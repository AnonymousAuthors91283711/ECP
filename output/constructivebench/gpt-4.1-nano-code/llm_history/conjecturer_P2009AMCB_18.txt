. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The overlap occurs when both RachelPos and RobertPos are within 1/8 of 1/2, i.e., within [3/8, 5/8], for their respective functions over t ∈ [600, 660]. Due to the periodicity of 90 and 80, the intersection of these intervals repeats every common period 360, with no overlap within the interval [600, 660]. Hence, ratio is 0.0.
