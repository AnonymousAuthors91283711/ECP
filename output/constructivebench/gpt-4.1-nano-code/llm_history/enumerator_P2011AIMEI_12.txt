This problem involves counting permutations with specific adjacency constraints among men and women, akin to arrangements with "blocks" of men together, then counting permutations that contain at least 4 men consecutively. To approach this, I will enumerate configurations by small values, especially focusing on the number of men \( w \), given total \( n = 6 + w \).

The key ideas:
- Total permutations: \((6 + w)!\).
- Valid permutations: permutations where every man is next to at least one other man.
- Success permutations: among valid, permutations where at least 4 men are lined up consecutively.
- Find the minimal \( w \) satisfying the bounds.

Given constraints, I will:
- Fix small \( w \) from 0 up to a manageable limit.
- For each \( w \), compute total permutations.
- Use combinatorial logic or enumeration (via brute-force in code) to count valid permutations and then those with at least 4 men consecutively.
- Stream the answers as I go, then identify the least \( w \) satisfying the ratio constraint.

Here's a sketch in code that enumerates these possibilities efficiently enough with small \( w \).

```python
import itertools
import math

# Helper function to check if every man is adjacent to at least one other man
def valid_perm(w):
    n = 6 + w
    men = set(range(w))
    for perm in itertools.permutations(range(n)):
        valid = True
        for m in men:
            pos = perm.index(m)
            neighbors = []
            if pos > 0:
                neighbors.append(perm[pos - 1])
            if pos < n -1:
                neighbors.append(perm[pos + 1])
            if not any(neighbor in men for neighbor in neighbors):
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            yield perm

# Count valid permutations
def count_valid(w):
    count = 0
    for _ in valid_perm(w):
        count +=1
    return count

# Check permutations with at least 4 men together consecutively
def count_success(w):
    n = 6 + w
    count = 0
    for perm in valid_perm(w):
        # check if there's a block of 4 men consecutively
        for i in range(n - 3):
            block = perm[i:i+4]
            if all(m < w for m in block):  # all men
                count +=1
                break
    return count

# Enumerate small w to find minimal satisfying ratio
for w in range(0, 10):
    total = math.factorial(6 + w)
    valid_count = count_valid(w)
    success_count = count_success(w)
    if valid_count == 0:
        continue
    ratio = success_count / valid_count
    print(f"w={w}: total={total}, valid={valid_count}, success={success_count}, ratio={ratio:.4f}")
    # check if ratio â‰¤ 1/100
    if ratio <= 0.01:
        print(f"Conjectured minimal w: {w}")
        break
```
