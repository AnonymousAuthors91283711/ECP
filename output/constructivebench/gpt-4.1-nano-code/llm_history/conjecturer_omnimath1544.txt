. Enumerated answers: All candidate solutions for z: set(). Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
Given the expression for P and the relationship between x, y, and z, substituting y^2 as t and simplifying leads to a quadratic in x with solutions at x = ±√(1 - 2t). Since z = x + 2t, the possible z-values are x + 2t = ±√(1 - 2t) + 2t. These are only real when 1 - 2t ≥ 0, i.e., t ≤ 1/2. The possible z values form a set where z = t ± √(1 - 2t). When t ranges from 0 to 1/2, z takes all real values in the interval [t - √(1 - 2t), t + √(1 - 2t)], which simplifies to the entire real line as t varies over [0, 1/2].

Hence, the set of all such z is empty because the solutions require incompatible conditions, leading to no real solutions satisfying P.  

Final answer:
