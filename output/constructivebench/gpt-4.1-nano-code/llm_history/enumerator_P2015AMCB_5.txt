The problem is to find the least natural number \( N \) such that \( 19 \times (3 + N) \le 20 \times (1 + N) \). 

Let's analyze this algebraically:
\[
19(3 + N) \le 20(1 + N)
\]
\[
57 + 19N \le 20 + 20N
\]
\[
57 - 20 \le 20N - 19N
\]
\[
37 \le N
\]

Since \( N \in \mathbb{N} \), the least \( N \) satisfying this is \( N = 37 \).

Now, to assist in such reasoning and to generate a Python enumeration consistent with this process, the script will check values starting from 0 upwards until it finds the least \( N \) satisfying the inequality.

```python
# Enumerate N from 0 upwards to find the least N satisfying 19*(3+N) <= 20*(1+N)
def find_least_N():
    N = 0
    while True:
        lhs = 19 * (3 + N)
        rhs = 20 * (1 + N)
        print(N)  # Output each candidate as soon as it's checked
        if lhs <= rhs:
            print(f"Answer: {N}")
            return N
        N += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_least_N()
```
