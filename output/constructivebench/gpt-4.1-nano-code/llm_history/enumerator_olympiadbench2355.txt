[write_program]
The problem seems to involve simulating a two-step process with initial and updated faces, then calculating the probability that the second roll contains a specific face value (2). Since the code is in Lean, but I need to write a Python program to enumerate possible outcomes to help conjecture and prove the exact answer, I will:

- Enumerate all possible pairs of first and second roll results based on the logic.
- Count the number of total outcomes.
- Count how many second roll outcomes include the face 2.
- Compute the fraction and stream results for analysis.

Because the problem wants the probability that the second roll includes face 2, we can:

- Enumerate each face in the first roll.
- Generate corresponding second roll lists.
- Count the total and favorable outcomes directly.

This approach eliminates unnecessary repetition and looks for patterns.

```python
# Enumerate all initial faces
initial_faces = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8]

# Function to compute.update faces for a given face
def update_faces(x):
    if x % 2 == 1:
        # x is odd: double the odd face, keep even unchanged
        return [2 * y if y % 2 == 1 else y for y in initial_faces]
    else:
        # x is even: halve the even face, keep odd unchanged
        return [y // 2 if y % 2 == 0 else y for y in initial_faces]

total_outcomes = 0
favorable_outcomes = 0

# Enumerate over each initial face
for face in initial_faces:
    second_faces = update_faces(face)
    total_outcomes += 1
    # Count if 2 appears in second roll
    if 2 in second_faces:
        favorable_outcomes += 1
    print(f"First face: {face}, Second roll: {second_faces}")

# Calculate probability
probability = favorable_outcomes / total_outcomes
print(f"Total outcomes: {total_outcomes}")
print(f"Favorable outcomes (second roll contains 2): {favorable_outcomes}")
print(f"Probability that second roll contains 2: {favorable_outcomes}/{total_outcomes} = {probability}")
```
