The problem appears to involve solving an equation of the form \( 23 - \text{answer} = 3k \) with the constraint that \( \text{answer} < 23 \). Our goal is to find all potential integer values of 'answer' satisfying these conditions, and then identify the value that best fits the constraintsâ€”likely the maximum or solutions within the bounds.

Since the value of 'answer' is unknown, and the theorem states that no such \(k\) exists for the particular answer, we will enumerate all possible answers from 0 up to 22 (since answer < 23), check if \(23 - \text{answer}\) is divisible by 3, and then print all such answers.

This enumeration will help in finding the answer that satisfies the divisibility and inequality constraints.

```python
# Enumerate all possible answers less than 23
for answer in range(23):
    diff = 23 - answer
    if diff % 3 == 0:
        k = diff // 3
        print(f"answer = {answer}, 23 - answer = {diff}, divisible by 3, k = {k}")
```
