The problem defines a polynomial \( p \) as a product of factors \((1 - X^k)^{n_k}\) with exponents from given parameters. It then states that the coefficient of \( X^1 \) in \( p \) is \(-2\), and all higher coefficients up to \( X^{32} \) are zero. The goal is to find the value of \( f' \).

Given the nature of the factors \((1 - X^k)^{n_k}\), the key insight is that the coefficient of \( X^1 \) in the expanded polynomial \( p \) depends only on the exponents \( a, b, c, \dots, f' \). Since:

\[
(1 - X^k)^{n_k} = 1 - n_k X^k + \ldots
\]

the coefficient of \( X^1 \) in the product is the sum of the contributions from each factor:

- Only factors with \( k = 1 \) contribute directly to the \( X^1 \) term.
- For factors with \( k > 1 \), their expansion does not include an \( X^1 \) term (since they produce terms starting at \( X^{k} \)), thus do not affect the coefficient of \( X^1 \).

Hence:

\[
\text{coeff of } X^1 \text{ in } p = -a
\]

Given:

\[
\text{coeff of } X^1 = -2
\]

implies:

\[
-a = -2 \Rightarrow a = 2
\]

The problem also states that all coefficients \( X^i \) for \( 2 \leq i \leq 32 \) are zero, which forces constraints on the exponents for higher order terms, but the key parameter affecting \( X^1 \) is \( a \).

Since only \( a \) affects the coefficient of \( X^1 \), and it must be 2, the rest of the parameters ( \(b, c, \dots, f'\) ) can be arbitrary as long as they do not affect other conditions, which are zero coefficients for higher terms.

In conclusion, the value of \( f' \) is unconstrained by the given conditions; the only explicit value is \( a=2 \).

---

```python
# Since the coefficient of X^1 is determined by a, and it must be -2:
# a = 2

a = 2

# The rest of the parameters (b, c, ..., f') are arbitrary; thus, we can
# set f' to any small value (e.g., 0) for the minimal example.

f_prime = 0

print(f"f' = {f_prime}")  # Output the value of f'
```
