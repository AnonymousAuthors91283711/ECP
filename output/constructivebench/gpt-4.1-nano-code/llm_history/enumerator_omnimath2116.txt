The problem involves finding the infimum of a set defined by an expression involving nested square roots over an interval. To assist in conjecturing the exact answer, I will numerically evaluate the expression for sample values of \(x\) in \([-1, 1]\). Due to symmetry and the complexity, I'll check key points and some candidate values distributed evenly in the interval.

The goal is to identify the smallest value of the expression for \(x \in [-1, 1]\). Since the expression is continuous on a closed interval, approximate minima should help conjecture the exact infimum.

I'll evaluate at several points: \(-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1\), and some intermediate points to detect the trend. I'll keep track of the minimal approximate value found.

```python
import math

def evaluate_expression(x):
    term1 = math.sqrt(58 - 42 * x)
    # To avoid domain errors, ensure arguments are non-negative
    inner = 1 - x**2
    if inner < 0:
        return float('inf')
    term2_inner = 149 - 140 * math.sqrt(inner)
    if term2_inner < 0:
        return float('inf')
    term2 = math.sqrt(term2_inner)
    return term1 + term2

# Sample points in [-1, 1]
points = [-1, -0.75, -0.5, -0.25, 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]
min_value = float('inf')
min_point = None

for x in points:
    val = evaluate_expression(x)
    print(f"x = {x:.2f}, expression value ≈ {val:.4f}")
    if val < min_value:
        min_value = val
        min_point = x

print(f"Approximate minimal value is {min_value:.4f} at x ≈ {min_point:.2f}")

# Further refinement could involve more sampling, but this gives a good starting point.
```
