The problem provides a system of equations involving real numbers a, b, c, d, and asks to find certain linear combinations that can be expressed as a rational number m/n with coprime numerator and denominator, plus their sum. The key is to determine the value of `a + 16*b + 81*c + 256*d`.

Since the problem is designed as a competition math problem, the typical approach involves solving the linear system to find the exact (possibly rational) value of these expressions. The equations resemble a pattern related to powers of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, suggesting a possible interpolation or pattern recognition.

To assist with the conjecture, I will:
- Express a, b, c, d in terms of the given equations;
- Compute `a + 16*b + 81*c + 256*d`;
- Find its rational form;
- Then identify numerator and denominator, ensuring they are coprime.

Given the constraints, I will primarily focus on enumerating the solution for the expression in question, using rational approximations where pertinent, without hardcoding the ground-truth answer.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# The system is linear; solve symbolically using substitution or elimination.
# Given equations:
# 1) a + b + c + d = 1
# 2) a + 2b + 3c + 4d = 10
# 3) a + 4b + 9c + 16d = 100
# 4) a + 8b + 27c + 64d = 1000

# Let's set up the augmented matrix and solve for a, b, c, d:
# Using SymPy for symbolic computation
import sympy as sp

a, b, c, d = sp.symbols('a b c d')

eq1 = sp.Eq(a + b + c + d, 1)
eq2 = sp.Eq(a + 2*b + 3*c + 4*d, 10)
eq3 = sp.Eq(a + 4*b + 9*c + 16*d, 100)
eq4 = sp.Eq(a + 8*b + 27*c + 64*d, 1000)

solutions = sp.solve([eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4], (a, b, c, d))

# Compute the expression a + 16b + 81c + 256d
expr = solutions[a] + 16*solutions[b] + 81*solutions[c] + 256*solutions[d]
# Convert to a Fraction for exactness
fraction_expr = Fraction(expr).limit_denominator()

# Extract numerator and denominator
m, n = fraction_expr.numerator, fraction_expr.denominator

# Since problem asks for coprime m,n with sum m + n
print(f"Numerator: {m}")
print(f"Denominator: {n}")
print(f"Sum m + n: {m + n}")

# Output the answer as per problem's expectation
print(f"∃ m n : ℕ, Nat.Coprime m n ∧ (a + 16*b + 81*c + 256*d) = {m}/{n} and m + n = {m + n}")
