This problem involves a recursive calculation of a 2D array \( T \), with base and recursive conditions, and then counting the number of indices \( i \) for which there's some \( j \) with \( T_i_j \equiv 0 \pmod{67} \). To explore solutions, I'll implement a code that:

- Constructs \( T \) based on the given recursive rules.
- Checks for each \( i \) whether any \( T_i_j \equiv 0 \pmod{67} \).
- Counts how many such \( i \) exist.
  
Because the parameters are small (\( 100 \times 100 \)), brute-force enumeration is feasible and efficient. The code will print intermediate findings (which \( i \) and \( j \) satisfy the condition), then print the total count at the end.

```python
# Enumerate T based on the recurrence and count the number of i's where some T_i_j ≡ 0 mod 67
def main():
    N = 100
    T = [[0]*N for _ in range(N)]
    # Initialize T[0][j]
    for j in range(N):
        T[0][j] = 2*j + 1
        if T[0][j] % 67 == 0:
            print(f"T[0][{j}] ≡ 0 mod 67 (value: {T[0][j]})")
    # Compute recursively
    for i in range(N-1):
        for j in range(N - 1 - i):
            T[i+1][j] = T[i][j] + T[i][j+1]
            if T[i+1][j] % 67 == 0:
                print(f"T[{i+1}][{j}] ≡ 0 mod 67 (value: {T[i+1][j]})")
    # Count i with at least one j satisfying the condition
    count = 0
    for i in range(N):
        if any(T[i][j] % 67 == 0 for j in range(N - i)):
            count += 1
    print(f"Total i with some T_i_j ≡ 0 mod 67: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
