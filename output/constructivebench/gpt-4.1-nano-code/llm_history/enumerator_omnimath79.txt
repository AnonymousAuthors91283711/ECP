This problem appears to be a combinatorial or measure-theoretic question related to counting triplets of functions over a finite set, with constraints involving sums of values within an interval [0, 1]. It seems to connect the counts of triplets where the sum is less than 1 and greater than 2 to the size n, which probably relates to the Pigeonhole Principle or combinatorial bounds.

Given the nature of the problem, a common approach is to choose small values for n, enumerate potential functions, compute the counts of triplets satisfying the inequalities, and observe the behavior to conjecture the minimal n satisfying the theorem.

Let's choose n=3, which is small enough to enumerate all functions (with 0/1 values in this case, since the ranges are within [0, 1]) and check the counts. We will generate all functions a, b, c from Fin 3 to ℝ with values in [0,1], then count the triplets satisfying the inequalities, and compare counts with 2018.

Because the problem's core is about enumeration and confirming the minimal n, we will attempt n=3 and see if the counts cross 2018. If not, increment n until the counts meet the criteria.

```python
from itertools import product

# For simplicity, consider functions from Fin n to {0,1} (extreme cases)
# This aligns with the idea of extremal combinatory counts
def count_triplets(n):
    # Generate all a, b, c as functions from {0,...,n-1} to {0,1}
    domain = range(n)
    total_a = list(product([0, 1], repeat=n))
    total_b = list(product([0, 1], repeat=n))
    total_c = list(product([0, 1], repeat=n))
    count_less_than_1 = 0
    count_greater_than_2 = 0

    for a in total_a:
        for b in total_b:
            for c in total_c:
                less_count = 0
                greater_count = 0
                # Count triplets where sum(a[i], b[i], c[i]) satisfy the inequality
                for p in product(domain, repeat=3):
                    sum_val = a[p[0]] + b[p[1]] + c[p[2]]
                    if sum_val < 1:
                        less_count += 1
                    if sum_val > 2:
                        greater_count += 1
                if less_count >= 2018:
                    count_less_than_1 += 1
                if greater_count >= 2018:
                    count_greater_than_2 += 1
    return count_less_than_1, count_greater_than_2

# Try small n, starting with 3
n = 3
lt1, gt2 = count_triplets(n)

print(f"n = {n}")
print(f"Count of triplets with ≤ 2018 sum < 1: {lt1}")
print(f"Count of triplets with ≤ 2018 sum > 2: {gt2}")

# Based on this, assess whether the counts meet or exceed 2018.
# Increase n if counts are too small; stop when counts meet/above 2018.
# For larger n, full enumeration may be infeasible; thus, we stop here for demonstration.
