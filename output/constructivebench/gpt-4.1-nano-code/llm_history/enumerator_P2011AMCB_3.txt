The problem involves finding the unique real number \( x \) satisfying \( A + x = B - x \), which simplifies to \( 2x = B - A \). The answer is \( x = \frac{B - A}{2} \). The problem appears to define a function \( P2011AMCB_3_answer \) that returns this value, and then asserts the existence and uniqueness of such \( x \).

To assist in conjecturing and proving, I'll write a Python script that:  
- Uses small sample values for \( A \) and \( B \) with \( A < B \),  
- Enumerates candidate solutions for \( x \),  
- Explicitly computes the purported solution \( (B - A)/2 \), and  
- Checks the equation \( A + x = B - x \) to confirm correctness.

Since the actual value is straightforward, enumeration is trivial—you just verify the solution for sample pairs. To better understand the structure and possible variations, I’ll generate multiple pairs and compute their solutions.

```python
# Enumerate small sample values for A and B with A < B.
# For each, compute the solution x = (B - A)/2 and verify the equation.

samples = [
    (1, 3),
    (0, 4),
    (-2, 2),
    (5, 10),
    (100, 105),
    (-10, 0)
]

for A, B in samples:
    # Ensure A < B
    if A >= B:
        continue
    x = (B - A) / 2
    # Verify the solution
    left = A + x
    right = B - x
    print(f"A={A}, B={B}")
    print(f"Computed x = (B - A)/2 = {x}")
    print(f"Check: A + x = {left}, B - x = {right}")
    print(f"Equation holds: {abs(left - right) < 1e-9}\n")
```

This code outputs potential solutions and verifies their correctness, aiding conjecture and proof by illustrating that the solution is always \( (B - A)/2 \) for chosen samples.
