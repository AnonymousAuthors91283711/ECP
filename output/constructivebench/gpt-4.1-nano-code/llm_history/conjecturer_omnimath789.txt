theorem omnimath789 :
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∃ (c v : ℕ), c + v = n ∧ 2 * c * v * (c^2 + v^2) = 4800} omnimath789_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No solutions found within the given bounds.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the enumeration indicating no solutions within bounds, the minimal n with such properties does not exist. For the "least" to exist, the set must be empty, implying a default minimal value, usually 0. Therefore, the answer is:

<<<0>>>
