The problem involves a recurrence relation for a sequence \(a_n\), a set involving a supremum over certain \(x_k \geq 0\), and an expression with sums and parameters. To assist in conjecturing and potentially formulating an answer, I will generate candidate values for \(a_n\), \(x_k\), and \(A_k\) with small parameters, and evaluate the sum involved. Since the sequence \(a_n\) is defined recursively from \(a_1 = 1/4\), I will generate the first few terms, and then approximate the sum for particular choices of \(x_k\).

I'll focus on small, simple choices for \(x_k\), e.g., setting all \(x_k = 0\), which satisfies the non-negativity condition \(x_k \geq 0\). Then, compute the sum involving \(A_k\), which depends on \(x_k\) and a large summation index range. This approach will provide approximate upper bounds.

The key idea:
- Set \(a_1 = 1/4\).
- Compute subsequent \(a_n\) via the recurrence.
- Use \(x_k = 0\) to simplify \(A_k\).
- Compute the sum for \(A_k\) with this choice.
- Output each candidate sum iteratively.

Here is the code:

```python
# Enumerate initial sequence a_n based on recurrence
def generate_a_sequence(n_terms):
    a = [0]  # 1-based indexing
    a.append(1/4)  # a_1
    for n in range(2, n_terms+1):
        a_prev = a[n-1]
        a_n = 1/4 * (1 + a_prev) ** 2
        a.append(a_n)
        print(f"a_{n} = {a_n}")
    return a

# For simplicity, choose x_k = 0 for k=1..N
def compute_A(k, x_value, sum_range):
    numerator = x_value - k
    total = 0
    for i in range(k, sum_range+1):
        total += x_value + (i * (i - 1)) / 2 + 1
    denom = (total) ** 2
    return numerator / denom if denom != 0 else float('inf')

n_terms = 10
a_values = generate_a_sequence(n_terms)

# Sum over A_k for k=1..2002, with x_k = 0
sum_A = 0
sum_range = 2002
for k in range(1, 11):  # limit to first 10 for demonstration
    A_k = compute_A(k, 0, sum_range)
    sum_A += A_k
    print(f"At k={k}, A_k={A_k}")

print(f"Partial sum of A_k for k=1..10: {sum_A}")
```

This code:
- Generates first 10 \(a_n\) terms following the recurrence.
- Sets \(x_k=0\) for the first 10, simplifying \(A_k\).
- Computes the sum of \(A_k\) from \(k=1\) to 10, approximating the behavior.
- Prints each part immediately for conjectural analysis.

This should help understand the bounds and behavior of the sum in the problem.
