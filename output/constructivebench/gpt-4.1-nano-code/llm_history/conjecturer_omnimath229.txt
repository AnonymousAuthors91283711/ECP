Based on the given candidates and the functional equation's symmetry, the solutions are likely constant zero functions and specific quadratic functions. The pattern suggests the set includes these functions, but the zero function is common and simple. Generalizing, the solutions involve constant zero functions and quadratic functions with specific coefficients.

The error arises because in Lean, you cannot directly write `f(x)` within the set comprehension syntax. Instead, within `{f : ℝ → ℝ | ... }`, to specify properties involving `f x`, you need to write `∀ x : ℝ, ...` or use a lambda abstraction inline by referring to `f` applied to `x`. Furthermore, since `f : ℝ → ℝ`, the property must be a universally quantified relation involving `x`, e.g., `∀ x, f x = 0 ∨ (∃ a b, f x = a * x^2 + b * x)`.

Given that, the set of solutions is characterized by functions `f` that are either zero functions or quadratic functions of the form `a * x^2 + b * x`.  
Also, to present this as a set in Lean, I should write an explicit set comprehension over functions `f : ℝ → ℝ` such that, for all real `x`, the value of `f` at `x` satisfies the specified property.

Thus, the corrected form is:

```lean
{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x : ℝ, f x = 0 ∨ (∃ a b : ℝ, f x = a * x^2 + b * x)}
```

This matches the enumerated answer's intent, only adjusted to satisfy Lean syntax.

<<<{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x : ℝ, f x = 0 ∨ (∃ a b : ℝ, f x = a * x^2 + b * x)}>>>
