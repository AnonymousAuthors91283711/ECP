Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 0
Since the problem involves a specific mathematical expression and asks for a proof, but both the ground truth answer and the proposed answer are marked as `sorry` (which typically means "not provided" or "to be filled in later" in theorem-proving contexts like Lean), it's impossible to verify the equivalence of the answers. 

The proposed answer is `0`, but without the ground truth answer or any additional context, we cannot determine if this is correct or equivalent.
