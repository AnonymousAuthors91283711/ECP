This problem involves integers \( x, y, z, t \) with positive constraints, and expressions involving their products and sums. The core challenge is to analyze conditions where \( xy - zt = x + y \), \( x + y = z + t \), and whether \( xy \) and \( zt \) are perfect squares, in relation to an answer `IMO2018SLN5_answer`. 

Since the problem seems to be about exploring integer solutions and their properties, we'll set small values for variables to systematically test cases where the sums match and see whether \( xy \) and \( zt \) are squares or not. We will explore all small positive integers up to a small threshold for \( x,y,z,t \), satisfy the algebraic constraints, and check the perfect square property.

```python
# Enumerate small positive integer solutions for x, y, z, t up to a threshold
# satisfying x + y = z + t and xy - zt = x + y. For each, check if xy and zt are perfect squares.
import math

threshold = 10
results = []

for x in range(1, threshold + 1):
    for y in range(1, threshold + 1):
        sum_xy = x + y
        xy = x * y
        for z in range(1, threshold + 1):
            for t in range(1, threshold + 1):
                sum_zt = z + t
                zt = z * t
                # Check the key conditions
                if sum_xy == sum_zt and xy - zt == sum_xy:
                    xy_is_square = int(math.isqrt(xy)) ** 2 == xy
                    zt_is_square = int(math.isqrt(zt)) ** 2 == zt
                    # Output cases where at least one of xy or zt is not a perfect square
                    if not (xy_is_square and zt_is_square):
                        print(f"x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, t={t}, xy={xy} (square={xy_is_square}), zt={zt} (square={zt_is_square})")
                        results.append((x,y,z,t,xy_is_square,zt_is_square))
```
