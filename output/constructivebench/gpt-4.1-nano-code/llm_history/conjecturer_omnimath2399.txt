. Enumerated Answers: 126. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The main errors are due to improper usage of the choose notation. In Lean, `Nat.choose` is used as a function, so `(12 choose 4)` should be `(Nat.choose 12 4)`, and similarly `Nat.choose 11 3`. The pattern suggests the answer involves binomial coefficients, scaled and summed to account for counting specific functions with constraints.

Based on the enumeration (which gives 126 as the total count), and the pattern of the candidate formula, the formula likely computes the total number of functions from a set of size 12 to 2, with exactly 4 ones, but subtracting cases where some forbidden pattern occurs, scaled appropriately.

Final corrected answer, in the pattern of the formulas and using `Nat.choose`, is:

<<<4 * Nat.choose 12 4 - 3 * Nat.choose 11 3>>>
