abbrev omnimath3443_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3443 : 
  3/4 + 4/omnimath3443_answer = 1 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 16
Proposed Answer: (16/3)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation given is: 3/4 + 4/x = 1
2. Solving for x:
   - Subtract 3/4 from both sides: 4/x = 1/4
   - Take reciprocals: x/4 = 4
   - Multiply both sides by 4: x = 16

The ground truth answer is 16, which correctly solves the equation.

The proposed answer is 16/3. Let's test it:
3/4 + 4/(16/3) = 3/4 + (4*3)/16 = 3/4 + 12/16 = 3/4 + 3/4 = 6/4 = 1.5 ≠ 1

The proposed answer does not satisfy the original equation.

<<<False>>>
