[write_program]
The given statement resembles a classic problem related to functions from natural numbers to natural numbers, concerning periodicity and eventual periodicity. It effectively models the statement: "If for every function \( a:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \), the condition that for each \(k\), there exists a \( t \) such that \( a(k + m t) = a(k) \) for all \( m \), then there exists a \( T \) such that \( a(k + T) = a(k) \) for all \( k \)."

This is reminiscent of a property related to *eventual periodicity*, similar to concepts like the Pigeonhole principle or the notion that eventually, a function must repeat values after some period.

In particular, the theorem appears to state an equivalence: the property holds for all functions if and only if a global period \( T \) exists for all \( a \). Notably, this is related to the *Birkhoff's periodicity theorem* or *eventual periodicity for functions from the natural numbers*.

Given the problem's nature, the non-trivial part is to detect that such a universal \( T \) exists, based on the local periodicity conditions, which resemble the statement of *eventually periodic functions*.

---

### Approach:
- Since the theorem deals with all functions \( a:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \), we can try to test small functions.
- The program will look for functions \( a \) (represented as finite sequences) that satisfy the local periodicity condition with some \( t \), but do not have a global period \( T \).
- We search for counterexamples to show the non-triviality of the statement, or verify the simple fact that the properties are equivalent by testing small finite functions.

### Implementation:
- Define small functions \( a \) over initial natural numbers.
- For each, try to find \( t \) satisfying the local periodicity pattern.
- Check if there's a global \( T \), and if not, find counterexamples.

The program will print all candidate functions and checks.
