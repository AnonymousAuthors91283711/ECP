The problem seeks the greatest real number \( p \) satisfying the inequality:
\[
p \times (1 - 0.2) \times (1 + 0.075) \leq 43
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
p \times 0.8 \times 1.075 \leq 43
\]
or
\[
p \leq \frac{43}{0.8 \times 1.075}
\]
Calculating this gives the maximum possible \( p \).

Here is a Python program to find and verify this maximum:

```python
# Compute the maximum p satisfying p * (0.8) * (1.075) <= 43
# Since the inequality is linear in p, the maximum p is exactly 43 divided by (0.8 * 1.075).

# Constants
multiplier = 0.8 * 1.075
max_p = 43 / multiplier

# Output the exact maximum p
print(max_p)

# Verify it's the greatest p satisfying the inequality (within floating point tolerance)
candidate_ps = [max_p - delta for delta in [0, 1e-8, 1e-6, 1e-4]]
for p in candidate_ps:
    left_side = p * multiplier
    print(f"p = {p:.10f}, p * multiplier = {left_side:.10f}")
    assert left_side <= 43 + 1e-8, "Candidate p does not satisfy the inequality."  # within tolerance
```
