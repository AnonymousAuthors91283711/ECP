This problem involves a system of equations:
1. \( S \times 4 = B \times 7 \)
2. \( S = B + 12 \)

We need to find \( S + B \). Let's choose small values for \( B \) to find corresponding \( S \), check if the conditions hold, and record \( S + B \). We won't hardcode the answer but will enumerate possible values and output the sums when conditions are satisfied.

Since the equations imply a linear system, plugging in small positive values of \( B \), we check the equation \( 4S = 7B \). For each \( B \), we compute \( S \) from \( S = B + 12 \), then verify whether \( 4S = 7B \) holds. 

Enumerate values of \( B \) within a reasonable range (e.g., 0 to 50).

```python
# Enumerate B from 0 to 50
for B in range(51):
    S = B + 12
    # Check if 4*S == 7*B
    if 4 * S == 7 * B:
        answer = S + B
        print(answer)
```
