This problem asks for the number of distinct products d₁ * d₂, where both d₁ and d₂ are positive divisors of 100000, and d₁ ≠ d₂. The set S includes all positive divisors of 100000. The goal is to find the size of the set of all unique products of two distinct elements from S.

Key observations:
- 100000 = 2^5 * 5^5
- The divisors are formed from exponents (a, b) with 0 ≤ a ≤ 5 and 0 ≤ b ≤ 5
- The number of divisors is (5+1)*(5+1)=36
- We need to consider all pairs (d₁, d₂) with d₁ ≠ d₂ and count unique products

Since enumerating all pairs and products explicitly can be large but manageable for 36 divisors, we will generate all divisors, then compute products for pairs of distinct divisors, store in a set, and then count.

Here is the code:

```python
# Enumerate all divisors of 100000 = 2^5 * 5^5
divisors = []
for a in range(6):  # exponents for 2
    for b in range(6):  # exponents for 5
        d = (2 ** a) * (5 ** b)
        divisors.append(d)

# Use a set to store unique products of two distinct divisors
products = set()

# Generate all pairs (d1, d2) with d1 != d2
for i, d1 in enumerate(divisors):
    for j, d2 in enumerate(divisors):
        if i != j:
            products.add(d1 * d2)

# Output the total count
print(len(products))
```
