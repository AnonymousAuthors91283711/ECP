The problem appears to involve analyzing a symmetric expression involving variables x, y, z ≥ 1. The key here is to understand under what conditions the minimum of the three square roots equals the sum of three square roots of (variable - 1).

Since the problem involves an equality between a minimum of three square roots and a sum of three similar square roots, a natural conjecture is that the minimum is achieved when all three square roots are equal. This often occurs in symmetric expressions when the variables are equal, especially in optimization problems with inequalities.

Let's examine setting x = y = z initially, and see when the equality holds:

- All variables ≥ 1
- The minimum of these three expressions is likely achieved when the three quantities are equal.
- Then the equality reduces to checking when:

sqrt(x + x * x * x) = sqrt(x + x^3) 

and whether this matches:

3 * sqrt(x - 1) = ?

But since the problem involves a parameter c > 1 and an explicit answer, perhaps the solution involves a parametrization c > 1 such that (x, y, z) can be expressed as functions of c.

Because the content does not specify the exact form of `omnimath218_answer`, but the code wants to enumerate possible answers to help conjecture, one approach is to test specific values c > 1, and see if variables satisfying the equations can be found.

Thus, I will pick some small values of c > 1, and for each, examine candidate solutions (x, y, z), especially equal solutions, to see if the equality holds.

Here's a simple enumeration that tests c = 1.1, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, etc., and tries to find corresponding (x, y, z). Since the problem is algebraic, we'll assume solutions with x=y=z=c (testing symmetric points).

```python
# Enumerate candidate c > 1 decently up to a threshold and check the equality
# Assuming the key points occur at symmetric points x=y=z=c

import math

# List of sample c values larger than 1
c_values = [1.1, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0]
for c in c_values:
    # Assume symmetric solution x=y=z=c
    x = y = z = c
    sqrt_exprs = [
        math.sqrt(x + x * y * z),
        math.sqrt(y + x * y * z),
        math.sqrt(z + x * y * z)
    ]
    min_sqrt = min(sqrt_exprs)
    sum_sqrt_minus_one = 3 * math.sqrt(c - 1)
    # Print the candidate c and compare min of roots and sum of roots minus 1
    print(f"c = {c:.2f}, sqrt expressions = {sqrt_exprs}, min = {min_sqrt:.4f}, 3*sqrt(c-1) = {sum_sqrt_minus_one:.4f}")
    # Check if the equality approximately holds
    if abs(min_sqrt - sum_sqrt_minus_one) < 1e-6:
        print(f"Possible solution at c = {c:.2f}: (x,y,z) = ({c}, {c}, {c})")
```
