Ground Truth Answer: 114
Proposed Answer: (130 - 0) + (164 - 34) + (188 - 58) - 482
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer step by step.

1. The problem is about finding a number (P2009AIMEII_1_answer) that satisfies several constraints involving variables b, r, w, p representing counts of different colored balls.

2. The ground truth answer is 114, which comes from solving the system of equations derived from the constraints.

3. The proposed answer calculates:
   (130 - 0) + (164 - 34) + (188 - 58) - 482
   = 130 + 130 + 130 - 482
   = 390 - 482
   = -92

4. This clearly doesn't match the ground truth answer of 114. The proposed answer gives a negative number (-92) which doesn't make sense in this context (as we're counting balls).

5. The proposed answer seems to be attempting some calculation based on the given numbers, but it's completely incorrect and doesn't satisfy any of the problem's constraints.
