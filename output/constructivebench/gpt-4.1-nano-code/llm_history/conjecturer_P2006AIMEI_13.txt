The sum of p-adic valuations of 2k over range 0 to 2^(n-1) - 1 simplifies based on whether k is even or odd, ultimately leading to a quadratic pattern. The maximum n under 1000 satisfying the condition appears near n=9, where the sum becomes a perfect square. As the sequence grows quadratically and stops at the boundary, the greatest such n is 9, corresponding to the sum value of 25.
