abbrev omnimath3260_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3260 (x : ℝ) : (512 : ℝ)^x = (64 : ℝ)^240 ↔ x = omnimath3260_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 160.0
160.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the equality \( (512)^x = 64^{240} \). Rewrite as \( 2^{9x} = 2^{6 \times 240} \), so \( 9x = 1440 \). The solution is \( x = 1440 / 9 = 160 \).
