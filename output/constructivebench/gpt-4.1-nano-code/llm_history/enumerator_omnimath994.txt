This problem appears to involve calculating the probability that two randomly chosen pairs from a set are of the same color, considering specific pairs with given sizes. The key is to compute the ratio of the number of same-color pairs over total pairs, factoring in the special "red" and "green" color pairs explicitly.

The steps:
- Sum over each color's pairs: count ways to choose 2 items of that color.
- Count the total pairs of red and green explicitly.
- Compute the ratio.

Let's choose small sample values for the large number (e.g., 2000) to keep calculations manageable. We avoid hardcoding the result; instead, we compute directly and approximate as needed, trusting that the result will be a rational number.

```python
# Program to compute the ratio of same-color pairs over total pairs involving specific pairs

# Define sample size for the large count (e.g., 2000)
large_count = 2000

# List of colors with their counts
color_counts = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, large_count]  # sizes
# Corresponding color labels
colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "magenta", "lavender", "neon", "mauve", "wisteria", "copper"]

# Compute sum over same-color pairs: n*(n-1)
same_color_sum = 0
for n in color_counts:
    val = n * (n - 1)
    print(f"Color count: {n}, pairs: {val}")
    same_color_sum += val

# Compute pairs for red and green
red_index, green_index = 0, 1
red_pairs = 2 * (2 - 1)  # for red
green_pairs = 2 * (2 - 1)  # for green
red_green_pairs = red_pairs + green_pairs
print(f"Red pairs: {red_pairs}, Green pairs: {green_pairs}, Total red/green pairs: {red_green_pairs}")

# Calculate total pairs
total_pairs = same_color_sum + red_green_pairs
print(f"Total same-color pairs: {same_color_sum}")
print(f"Total pairs (including red/green): {total_pairs}")

# Compute the ratio
ratio = same_color_sum / total_pairs
print(f"Probability (ratio): {ratio}")
```
