Ground Truth Answer: 1/4
Proposed Answer: 1/3
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves computing a triple integral of the minimum function over the unit cube [0,1]×[0,1]×[0,1].

2. The ground truth answer is 1/4, while the proposed answer is 1/3.

3. To verify, let's think about the integral conceptually:
   - The function min(a, min(b,c)) = min(a,b,c)
   - We're integrating the minimum of three uniform random variables over [0,1]
   - The expected value of the minimum of n uniform random variables is known to be 1/(n+1)
   - For n=3, this would be 1/4

4. The proposed answer of 1/3 would be correct for the minimum of two variables (n=2), but not for three variables.

Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect.
