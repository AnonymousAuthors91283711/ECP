  omnimath874_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 1114112. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The functions utilize geometric progression and differences to generate powers of two, and the final value at g 16 matches 2^16. The only such maximum is 2^16, i.e., 65536, which in decimal matches 1114112 multiplied by 1 (identity). After analysis, the maximum N is 2^16 = 65536.
