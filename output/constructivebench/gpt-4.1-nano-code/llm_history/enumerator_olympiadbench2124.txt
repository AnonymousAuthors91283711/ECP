[write_program]
This appears to be a formal Lean theorem about some geometric configuration involving n boxes (probably polygons or regions) in Euclidean space, with a specific property about adjacency and overlaps. The problem seems to involve finding the greatest value of n for which the property can hold, based on the description of overlaps and adjacency conditions.

Given the problem's structure, I will assume it is about a circle or polygon arrangement, and the key condition is about neighboring boxes overlapping exactly when they are neighbors in a cycle, with each pair of neighboring boxes overlapping at some point.

To assist conjecturing, I'll write a Python script to generate possible values of n, checking small values first, and identifying which n satisfy similar conditions (e.g., overlapping neighboring boxes and disjoint others). 

Since the problem is theoretical, I can simulate the property with intervals or geometric objects in 2D, and check for overlaps only with neighbors, ignoring more complex overlaps. I will generate candidate n, starting with small n, and check for possible configurations.

```python
# Program to find the largest n satisfying the adjacency-overlap property
# Assume n is small, check for n from 3 up to 20
# We simulate by placing n boxes in a circle, each overlapping with neighbors
# but not with others.

def check_configuration(n):
    # For n boxes arranged in a circle, each overlaps only with neighbors
    # Let's model boxes as intervals on a circle with arc length
    # For simplicity, assign each box an arc of length slightly greater than 1/n to ensure overlaps with neighbors
    # but no overlap with non-neighbors.
    # For the purpose of enumeration, check if the overlaps only occur with immediate neighbors
    
    # For circle partition:
    arc_size = 1 / (n + 1)  # small enough to prevent multiple overlaps
    boxes = []
    for i in range(n):
        start = (i * arc_size) % 1.0
        end = start + arc_size
        boxes.append((start, end))
    
    # Check overlaps:
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j:
                # Check if boxes i and j overlap
                over = overlaps(boxes[i], boxes[j])
                # Only neighbors should overlap
                if abs(i - j) % n == 1 or abs(i - j) % n == n - 1:
                    # Should overlap
                    if not over:
                        return False
                else:
                    # Non-neighbors should not overlap
                    if over:
                        return False
    return True

def overlaps(b1, b2):
    a_start, a_end = b1
    b_start, b_end = b2
    return not (a_end <= b_start or b_end <= a_start)

def main():
    max_n = 0
    for n in range(3, 21):
        if check_configuration(n):
            print(f"Possible configuration for n={n}")
            max_n = n
    print(f"Maximum n satisfying conditions is {max_n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
