theorem P2002AMCB_8 (N : ℕ) (startJuly : Fin 7) 
    (h : startJuly = 0 ∨ startJuly = 5 ∨ startJuly = 6) : 
    let startAugust := (startJuly.val + 31) % 7
    let augustDays := List.map (fun i => (startAugust + i) % 7) (List.range 31)
    augustDays.count P2002AMCB_8_answer = 5 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Start in July: 0, August weekday: 3, count: 5
Start in July: 0, August weekday: 4, count: 5
Start in July: 0, August weekday: 5, count: 5
Start in July: 5, August weekday: 1, count: 5
Start in July: 5, August weekday: 2, count: 5
Start in July: 5, August weekday: 3, count: 5
Start in July: 6, August weekday: 2, count: 5
Start in July: 6, August weekday: 3, count: 5
Start in July: 6, August weekday: 4, count: 5
. Expected Answer Type: Fin 7
The pattern shows starting weekdays (0,5,6) lead to August days with certain weekday distributions; all result in exactly 5 occurrences of specific weekdays within August. The answer seems to depend only on the start July weekday, leading to a fixed answer of 3 for these initial weekdays. Thus, the answer is a constant Fin 7 value representing the prevalent weekday count.
