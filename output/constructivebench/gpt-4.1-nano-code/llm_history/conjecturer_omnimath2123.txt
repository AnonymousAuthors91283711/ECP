The function \(f(x)\) must satisfy quadratic bounds, be quadratic itself, and have \(f(0)= y\). Since \(f(x) \geq (x+3)^2\) and \(f(x)\geq x^2+9\), the tightest quadratic polynomial with \(f(1) = 16\), satisfying these inequalities and minimizing \(f(0) = y\), occurs at the point where these bounds meet. The minimal \(f(0)\) is when \(f(x) = (x+3)^2\), which gives \(f(0)= 3^2 = 9\). Adjusting for the given \(f(1)=16\) instead of the base quadratic, the minimum \(f(0)\) is when the quadratic passes through \((1,16)\), with the lower bounds tangent, leading to \(f(0)=12\).
