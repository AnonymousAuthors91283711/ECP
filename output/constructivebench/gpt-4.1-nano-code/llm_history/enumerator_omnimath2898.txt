The problem appears to involve testing basic operations with the number 4 and 2, and determining the greatest value among these results. The candidates are:

- 4^2 = 16
- 4*2 = 8
- 4-2 = 2
- 4/2 = 2
- 4+2 = 6

The goal is to find the maximum of these results, which is 16. Instead of hardcoding the answer, we'll generate and compare the candidate results analytically and enumerate them with minimal computation.

```python
# Enumerate basic calculations with 4 and 2
candidates = [
    4 ** 2,
    4 * 2,
    4 - 2,
    4 / 2,
    4 + 2
]

# Print each candidate as identified
for result in candidates:
    print(result)

# Find and print the maximum candidate
max_result = max(candidates)
print("Maximum result:", max_result)
```
