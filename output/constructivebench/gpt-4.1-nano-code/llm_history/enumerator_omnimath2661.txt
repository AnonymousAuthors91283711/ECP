[write_program]
This problem defines two functions: f(x) = x + 4 and g(x) = f(x) - 6, and asks to determine the value of g(0). Let's analyze it with a simple program to simulate the evaluation and confirm the value.

Since g(x) = (x + 4) - 6 = x - 2, then g(0) = 0 - 2 = -2. To help confirm this and consider possible alternative interpretations, we can enumerate possible values around the calculation.

The program will explicitly compute g(0)ï¼Œ given the functions, and output the answer immediately:

```python
# The functions are straightforward:
# f(x) = x + 4
# g(x) = f(x) - 6 = (x + 4) - 6 = x - 2

# We are asked for g(0)
# g(0) = 0 - 2 = -2

# Verify the calculation dynamically (though simple)
x_value = 0
f_value = x_value + 4  # f(0)
g_value = f_value - 6  # g(0)

print(g_value)  # Output the result immediately
```
