This problem appears to involve a sequence of subtractions, each based on fractions of the previous value, ultimately checking when `day5 = 1`. To assist in conjecture, I will create a Python script that enumerates candidate values for `n` (small positive integers), computes `day1` through `day5` following the formula, and outputs cases where `day5` equals 1. The script prioritizes exact integer calculations, stops when solutions are found, and keeps runtime manageable by limiting search space.

```python
# Enumerate values of n from 1 up to a reasonable limit (e.g., 1000)
# For each n, compute the successive days as per the formulas
# Print n whenever day5 equals 1

for n in range(1, 1001):
    day1 = n - n // 2
    day2 = day1 - (day1 * 2) // 3
    day3 = day2 - (day2 * 3) // 4
    day4 = day3 - (day3 * 4) // 5
    day5 = day4 - (day4 * 5) // 6
    if day5 == 1:
        print(f"n={n}, day1={day1}, day2={day2}, day3={day3}, day4={day4}, day5={day5}")
```
