The sequence involves logs with base 12, and the differences are equal. Given the pattern, the second term minus the first equals the third minus the second, implying a constant difference. For the sequence to be arithmetic and considering the known values, the log base 12 of x must satisfy the same pattern. The pattern suggests the answer is a specific value of x that when plugged in yields an arithmetic sequence with the given known logs.

Based on the enumerated answer, the sequence's pattern points to the value where the sequence is arithmetic, approximating:

<<<269.99999999999966>>>
