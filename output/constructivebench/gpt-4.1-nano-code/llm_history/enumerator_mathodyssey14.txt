[write_program]
This problem involves enumerating sequences defined with specific recursive rules and prime power conditions, aiming to determine the greatest \( n \) for which the set of sequences satisfies the given constraints. To facilitate conjecturing, we will write a Python program that exhaustively searches for valid sequences with small initial values, confirming the structure, and identifying the maximum length \( n \).

The program will:
- Fix an initial \( q_0 \),
- Recursively generate subsequent \( q_i \) using \( q_i = (q_{i-1} - 1)^3 + 3 \),
- Check whether each \( q_i \) is a prime power,
- Continue until the sequence fails the prime power condition or hits a maximum length,
- Report the maximum \( n \) found, and the sequence details.

We focus on small \( q_0 \) to limit computation and find the maximum valid sequence length.

```python
import math

def is_prime_power(n):
    # Check if n is a power of a prime
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    # Try all possible bases p and exponents k
    for p in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 2):
        k = 0
        temp = n
        while temp % p == 0:
            temp //= p
            k += 1
        if temp == 1 and k >= 1:
            return True
    return False

max_start_q0 = 15  # Small sample initial values
max_length = 0
best_q0 = None

for q0 in range(1, max_start_q0 + 1):
    q = q0
    sequence = [q]
    for i in range(1, 50):  # Limit to 50 steps
        q_next = (q - 1) ** 3 + 3
        if not is_prime_power(q_next):
            break
        sequence.append(q_next)
        q = q_next
    n = len(sequence)
    print(f"Initial q0={q0}, sequence length={n}, sequence={sequence}")
    if n > max_length:
        max_length = n
        best_q0 = q0

print(f"Maximum sequence length: {max_length} starting from q0={best_q0}")
```
