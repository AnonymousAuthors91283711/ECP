theorem P2006AMCB_22 :
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∃ (a b c : ℕ), a + b + c = 2006 ∧ a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ c > 0 ∧ 
    ∃ (m : ℕ), a! * b! * c! = m * 10^n ∧ ¬(10 ∣ m)} P2006AMCB_22_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No such partition found within sampled range.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<0>>>
The minimal n with no such partition has m odd, avoiding divisibility by 10, thus answer is 0.
