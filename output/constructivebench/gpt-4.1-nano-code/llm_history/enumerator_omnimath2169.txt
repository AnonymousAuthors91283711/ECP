This formal statement from Mathlib involves a set S constructed from counts a, b, c satisfying a certain linear relation scaled by divisors and positivity constraints, and presumably a minimal element under a certain property. Our task: explore solutions (a, b, c) satisfying these constraints, to identify minimal such x (the sum a + b + c), streaming answers.

The constraints:
- a, b, c are positive integers
- a / 77 + b / 91 + c / 143 = 1

To find small solutions, multiply through by the common denominator 77*91*143, but more straightforwardly, we only need to test small a, b, c because the sums grow larger as the fractions approach 1.

Approach:
- Fix small a, b, c (e.g., up to a certain small number)
- Check the sum a + b + c where the fractional sum equals 1
- Print any solutions found immediately

This enumerates potential minimal sums and their solutions.

```python
# Enumerate small positive integer solutions to a/77 + b/91 + c/143 = 1
# For small a, b, c, check if the sum of fractions equals 1 (within a tolerance)
# When found, print the sum (minimal candidate) and the solution

def main():
    limit = 200  # a small limit for enumeration
    for a in range(1, limit):
        for b in range(1, limit):
            for c in range(1, limit):
                total = a/77 + b/91 + c/143
                if abs(total - 1) < 1e-9:
                    s = a + b + c
                    print(f"Solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, sum={s}")
                    # Continue search for possibly smaller sum solutions

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
