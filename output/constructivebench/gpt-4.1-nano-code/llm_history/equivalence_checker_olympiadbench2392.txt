Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {r | r = 6}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer {r | r = 6} is indeed the correct solution to the equation 2 + √(x-2) = x-2. Here's why:

1. Let's solve the equation step by step:
   - Let y = √(x-2), then the equation becomes 2 + y = y²
   - Rearrange: y² - y - 2 = 0
   - Solve the quadratic: y = (1 ± √(1 + 8))/2 → y = 2 or y = -1
   - Since y = √(x-2) ≥ 0, we take y = 2
   - Then √(x-2) = 2 → x-2 = 4 → x = 6

2. Verification:
   - For x=6: 2 + √(6-2) = 2 + 2 = 4
   - And 6-2 = 4
   - The equation holds

3. The solution set is indeed exactly {6}, so the proposed answer is correct.
