This problem involves finding the minimum value of \( k \) such that there exist non-negative real numbers \( x, y, z \) satisfying the given constraints, including a quadratic equation and a linear one. To approach this, we can parametrically explore possible \( z \) values, then solve for \( x, y \), checking if the constraints are met. Our goal is to identify the smallest \( k \) satisfying these conditions.

We will:

- Limit \( z \) to small, representative values (e.g., \( z = 0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1 \))
- For each \( z \), solve the quadratic in \( x, y \)
- Check non-negativity constraints
- Compute corresponding \( k = 5x + 4y + 3z \)
- Track and output candidate minimal \( k \)

This approach prioritizes efficiency and immediate partial answers.

for z in z_values:
    # Given equations:
    # 4*x^2 + 4*y^2 + z^2 + 2z = 3
    # 5x + 4y + 3z = k
    # For fixed z, solve for x, y from the quadratic:
    # 4x^2 + 4y^2 = 3 - z^2 - 2z

        continue  # no real solutions for x,y when RHS<0
    
    # Express y in terms of x:
    # y = (k - 5x - 3z)/4
    # But to find minimal k, set y in terms of x to minimize k = 5x + 4y + 3z
    # So for fixed x:
    # y = (k - 5x - 3z)/4
    # Instead, try to directly find x,y satisfying the quadratic

    # For fixed x, the maximum/minimum y is when y aligns with constraint:

    # But since y ≥ 0, focus on y ≥ 0 solutions
