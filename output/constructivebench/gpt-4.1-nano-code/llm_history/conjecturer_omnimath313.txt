open Matrix

abbrev omnimath313_answer : Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath313 : 
  ¬(∃ (A : Matrix (Fin 3) (Fin 3) ℝ), 
    trace A = 0 ∧ A ^ 2 + Aᵀ = 1) ↔ omnimath313_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: Prop
Given the constraints on the trace and the matrix equation, the problem appears to be about the non-existence of a 3×3 real matrix A with trace zero satisfying A^2 + Aᵀ = 1. Since the enumerated answer is empty, the statement is a false proposition. To express the negation directly:

<<<False>>>

This captures that no such matrix exists, matching the problem's negation.
