theorem IMO2022SLN2 (n : ℕ) :
  n > 2 ∧ n! ∣ ∏ p in Finset.filter (fun p => Prime p) (Finset.Icc 2 n),
    ∏ q in Finset.filter (fun q => Prime q ∧ p < q) (Finset.Icc 2 n), p + q
  ↔ n ∈ IMO2022SLN2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 3 satisfies the divisibility condition.
Solutions (n values satisfying the condition): [3]. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The only value satisfying the divisibility condition is n = 3; thus, IMO2022SLN2_answer = {3}. 

In Lean, the formal answer is: 

<<<{3}>>>

This matches the criteria of a closed form set eliminating existential quantifiers.
