This problem involves finding a number `omnimath1897_answer` such that the sum of reciprocals from 1 up to that number exceeds a given value `M` (which equals 5). The sum âˆ‘_{n=1}^{k} 1/n grows approximately like the harmonic series, which diverges slowly.

To solve this numerically, we'll:
- Use an iterative approach to find the smallest integer `k` such that the partial harmonic sum exceeds `M`.
- Since the sum of 1/n diverges for large n, but very slowly, we'll increment n, sum the reciprocals, and stop once we surpass `M`.

This matches the problem's requirement of enumerating candidates (here, partial sums) and streaming answers. We'll print each candidate sum that exceeds the threshold, along with the corresponding `k`.

The value of `omnimath1897_answer` will be set to the minimal k satisfying the inequality.

```python
# Enumerate values of n to find the smallest k where sum of 1/n > 5
target = 5
total = 0.0
n = 0
answers = []

while True:
    n += 1
    total += 1 / n
    print(f"k = {n}, partial sum = {total}")
    if total > target:
        print(f"Answer found: {n}")
        answers.append(n)
        break

# The answer is the minimal n where sum exceeds 5
# For use in the theorem, assign omnimath1897_answer accordingly.
```
