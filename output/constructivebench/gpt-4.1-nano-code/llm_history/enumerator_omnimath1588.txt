This problem involves summing cosine and sine terms over a range of angles and finding their ratio. The angles are given in degrees, starting from 30.5 degrees, incremented by 1 degree for 15 terms. To explore potential answers, we can numerically evaluate the sums directly.

We'll:
- Use small sample values (k = 0 to 14).
- Calculate the sums of cosines and sines separately.
- Compute their ratio.
- Stream results as we evaluate, highlighting any exact or approximate candidates.
- Avoid excessive computations, focusing on clarity.

```python
import math

# Define parameters
start_deg = 30.5
num_terms = 15
angles_deg = [start_deg + k for k in range(num_terms)]
angles_rad = [math.pi * angle / 180 for angle in angles_deg]

# Summation of cosine and sine
cos_sum = 0.0
sin_sum = 0.0

print("Evaluating sums for angles (degrees):", angles_deg)

for k, angle_rad in enumerate(angles_rad):
    c = math.cos(angle_rad)
    s = math.sin(angle_rad)
    cos_sum += c
    sin_sum += s
    # Output partial sums
    print(f"After term {k+1}: cos_sum = {cos_sum:.6f}, sin_sum = {sin_sum:.6f}")

# Compute ratio of sums
if abs(sin_sum) > 1e-12:
    ratio = cos_sum / sin_sum
    print(f"\nApproximate ratio (cos sum / sin sum): {ratio:.6f}")
else:
    print("\nSin sum is too close to zero, ratio undefined or infinite.")

# Enumerate possible rational approximations near the ratio if sin_sum is not zero
# (Optional: For more insight, could list rationals with small denominators)
```
