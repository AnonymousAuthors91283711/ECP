Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {x : ℝ | -3.5 ≤ x ∧ x ≤ -2.5 ∨ 3.4 ≤ x ∧ x ≤ 5}
<<<None>>>

Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in the proof assistant), we cannot verify whether the proposed answer matches it. The proposed answer provides specific intervals, but without knowing the correct solution, we cannot determine equivalence. The problem involves solving inequalities with rational expressions, which typically requires careful analysis of sign changes and critical points, but we lack the necessary information to verify correctness.
