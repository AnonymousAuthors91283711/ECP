abbrev omnimath2173_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2173 : 
  ∑ k in Finset.range (2^2014), (k ^^^ (k / 2)) = omnimath2173_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2^2013 * (2^2014 - 1)
Proposed Answer: 2 ^ (2014 + 1) - 1
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves summing the bitwise XOR (denoted ^^^) of each number k with k/2 for all k from 0 to 2^2014-1.

2. The ground truth answer is 2^2013 * (2^2014 - 1), which simplifies to 2^(2013+2014) - 2^2013 = 2^4027 - 2^2013.

3. The proposed answer is 2^(2014+1) - 1 = 2^2015 - 1.

4. Comparing the two:
   - Ground truth: 2^4027 - 2^2013
   - Proposed: 2^2015 - 1

These are clearly different expressions with different orders of magnitude. The proposed answer is incorrect.
