abbrev mathodyssey15_answer : ℕ × ℕ := sorry
theorem mathodyssey15 :
  let x := (sqrt 2 + sqrt 5) ^ 2000
  let n := ⌊x⌋.toNat
  let d := ⌊10 * (x - n)⌋.toNat
  n.digits 10 = [1] ∧ d = 9 ↔ (n, d) = mathodyssey15_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
<<<(1, 9)>>>
The pattern suggests that the integer part is 1, and the fractional part scaled by 10 gives 9, consistent with the problem's description.
