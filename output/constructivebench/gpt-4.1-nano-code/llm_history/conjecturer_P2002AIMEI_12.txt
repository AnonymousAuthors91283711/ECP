The pattern suggests the real parts of z_n grow towards 137/2, and the sum a + b converges to 275. The real parts likely tend to 137/2, with the sum of real and imaginary parts approaching 275. Thus, the closed form should be 275.

The proposed answer involves a qualitative description rather than a concrete real number. Since the problem involves a Möbius transformation that has a fixed point at \( z = 1 \), and the iteration \( z_{n+1} = F(z_n) \) starting from a point close to zero, the sequence \( z_n \) converges to the fixed point \( 1 \). The iterative process can be approximated linearly around the fixed point, and the real part of \( z_n \) is expected to approach 1. 

Looking at the initial value \( z_0 = \frac{1}{137} + i \), which is very close to zero, the iteration tends to stabilize near the fixed point \( z=1 \). Since \( a + b \) on the complex plane corresponds to the real + imaginary parts, and we expect \( z_n \to 1 \) (which has real part 1 and imaginary part 0), the sum of the real part and the imaginary part should approach \( 1 + 0 = 1 \).

Given that, the most natural conjectured limiting value for \( a + b \) is 1. Because the complex number \( z_{2002} \) converges and the sum \( a + b \) tends to this limit, the answer in the context of the problem is 1.

In Lean, expressing this as a closed-form real number:

<<<1>>>

This provides a suitable simple closed-form answer aligned with the fixed point theory and the observed iterative convergence.
