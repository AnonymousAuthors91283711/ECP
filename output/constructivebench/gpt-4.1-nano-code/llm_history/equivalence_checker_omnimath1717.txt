Ground Truth Answer: (1 - Real.sqrt 2) / 2
Proposed Answer: -0.207
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is a decimal approximation of the ground truth answer (1 - √2)/2 ≈ -0.207106781. While the numerical value is correct, the proposed answer doesn't provide the exact mathematical expression required by the problem. The ground truth answer gives the precise algebraic form, which is what would be expected in a mathematical proof context. Therefore, while the values are numerically equivalent, the forms are not identical.
