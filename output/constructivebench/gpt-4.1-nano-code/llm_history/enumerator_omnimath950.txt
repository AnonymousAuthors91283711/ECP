The problem appears to involve counting injective functions from Fin 100 to a product type, with a specific adjacency condition reminiscent of sequential connections. To help enumerate possible answers, especially the total count, I'll focus on constructing injective functions that satisfy the adjacency condition, where the second component's values differ by 1, akin to a path-like structure.

This problem resembles counting the number of injective functions with chain-like adjacency constraints, similar to counting paths through a set with adjacency rules.

Since exact formulas are complex, I will approximate by fixing small parameters and enumerating the possible sequences respecting adjacency, ensuring injectivity.

Below is a Python program to generate candidate sequences representing functions, counting sequences of length up to 100, with the adjacency rule, avoiding duplicates, and printing each valid sequence.

Note: The approach uses backtracking to generate sequences under the constraints, which aligns with the enumeration goal.

```python
# Enumerate injective functions from Fin 100 to Fin 2 x Fin 50
# with adjacency condition on the second component
# representing sequences of length up to 100

def enumerate_sequences(length, max_second=50):
    results = []

    def backtrack(seq, used_first, used_second):
        if len(seq) == length:
            results.append(seq[:])
            print(seq)
            return
        # Try all possible j with injectivity and adjacency conditions
        for j in range(length):
            # Avoid repeats
            if j in used_first:
                continue
            for s in range(1, max_second):
                # Check adjacency with previous
                if seq:
                    prev_f, prev_s = seq[-1]
                    # adjacency condition: second component differs by 1
                    if prev_f == j and abs(prev_s - s) == 1:
                        # Injectivity in both components
                        if j not in used_first and s not in used_second:
                            used_first.add(j)
                            used_second.add(s)
                            seq.append((j, s))
                            backtrack(seq, used_first, used_second)
                            seq.pop()
                            used_first.remove(j)
                            used_second.remove(s)
                else:
                    # First element
                    if j not in used_first and s not in used_second:
                        used_first.add(j)
                        used_second.add(s)
                        seq.append((j, s))
                        backtrack(seq, used_first, used_second)
                        seq.pop()
                        used_first.remove(j)
                        used_second.remove(s)

    backtrack([], set(), set())
    print(f"Total sequences found: {len(results)}")
    if results:
        print("Sample sequence:", results[0])

# Run enumeration for sequences of small size to keep computation feasible
enumerate_sequences(length=5)
