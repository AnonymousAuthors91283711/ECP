The problem asks for the number of integers n with real numbers such that √15 < n < √50. Since n is an integer, this reduces to counting integers within the interval (√15, √50).

Let's approximate: √15 ≈ 3.873 and √50 ≈ 7.071. So the integers n satisfying √15 < n < √50 are 4, 5, 6, 7.

We will enumerate these integers explicitly.

```python
# Enumerate integers n such that sqrt(15) < n < sqrt(50)
import math

lower_bound = math.sqrt(15)  # ≈ 3.873
upper_bound = math.sqrt(50)  # ≈ 7.071

# Find integers in the interval
answers = []

for n in range(4, 8):  # from 4 to 7 inclusive
    if lower_bound < n < upper_bound:
        print(n)
        answers.append(n)

print("Number of such integers:", len(answers))
```
