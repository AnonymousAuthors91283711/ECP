This problem involves number theory and divisors of a power of two. We need to find the value of \(K\) such that the product of all divisors of \(n=2^{T}\) equals \(2^K\). Since the divisors of \(2^{T}\) are all powers of 2 from \(2^{0}\) to \(2^{T}\), their product is well-understood and can be computed combinatorially. 

To enumerate answers, I will compute the divisors explicitly and find their product, then express the product as a power of 2 to determine \(K\). 

Since the number of divisors of \(2^{T}\) is \(T+1\), and divisors are \(2^{k}\) for \(k=0,\ldots,T\), the product of all divisors is:
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{T} 2^{k} = 2^{\sum_{k=0}^T k} = 2^{\frac{T(T+1)}{2}}
\]
Thus, \(K = \frac{T(T+1)}{2}\).

```python
# Enumerate the divisors of 2^T (which are 2^k for k=0 to T)
# The product of all divisors is 2^{sum of k=0 to T}
# So K = T*(T+1)/2

T = 20
K = T*(T+1)//2
print(K)
```
