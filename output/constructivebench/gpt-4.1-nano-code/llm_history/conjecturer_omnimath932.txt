  P.eval 1 = omnimath932_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 87. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The polynomial equality implies P evaluated at 1 yields the coefficient after division. Given the pattern and enumerations, the answer simplifies to dividing the constant term equivalently. The resulting value appears to be the value of the constant term of P when evaluated at 1.

Since the monomial (20*X^27 + 2*X^2 + 1) times P equals 2001*X^2001, the constant term of P corresponds to 87 based on enumeration.

Therefore, the closed-form answer is:

<<<87>>>
