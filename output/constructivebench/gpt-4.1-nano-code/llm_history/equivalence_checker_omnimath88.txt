Ground Truth Answer: fun k n => n * (3 * k)
Proposed Answer: fun k n => (k + 1) * (n + 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number m such that there exists a function f from Fin m to subsets of Fin(2n) where:
   - Each f(i) has exactly 2 elements
   - For any subset of size k+1, there exists two distinct elements whose images under f are not disjoint

2. The ground truth answer is n * (3 * k)
3. The proposed answer is (k + 1) * (n + 1)

These are clearly different functions:
- For k=1, n=1:
  - Ground truth: 1*(3*1) = 3
  - Proposed: (1+1)*(1+1) = 4
- For k=2, n=3:
  - Ground truth: 3*(3*2) = 18
  - Proposed: (2+1)*(3+1) = 12

The answers give different results and have different growth patterns. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth.
