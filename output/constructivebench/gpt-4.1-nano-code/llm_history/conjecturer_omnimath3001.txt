The issue arises because the `abbrev` definition is followed by a descriptive text rather than an actual Lean expression. In Lean, `abbrev` must be assigned a valid term of the specified type, here ℕ. The plaintext explanation appears unintentionally as part of the definition, causing the syntax error.

The proper fix is to assign directly the computed result `19` as the abbreviation. Based on the given calculation, the answer is 19.

Therefore, the corrected answer should be:

<<<19>>>
