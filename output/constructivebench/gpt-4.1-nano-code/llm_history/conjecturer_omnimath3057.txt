abbrev omnimath3057_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3057 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) :
  (∀ x, f x = a * x + b) ∧ (∀ x, f (b * x + a) = x) → a + b = omnimath3057_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Potential solution: a = -1, b = -1, a + b = -2. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests a linear function \(f(x) = a x + b\) with the condition \(f(b x + a) = x\), leading to a specific relation. Given the example where \(a = -1, b = -1\) resulting in \(a + b = -2\), the general solution implies the sum \(a + b\) always equals \(-2\) to satisfy the condition. 

Final answer:<<< -2 >>>
