The problem involves finding all integer pairs (a, b) with positive integers a > 0, b > 0, satisfying two equations involving quadratic expressions and rational multipliers. Without explicit hints, particularly about the possible ranges of a, b, or the nature of the solutions, we can consider small positive integer candidates to explore solutions.

We'll attempt to find pairs (a, b) with small positive integers (say up to 20) that satisfy the conditions:
- There exists an integer k such that: a^2 + b = k * (b^2 - a)
- There exists an integer m such that: b^2 + a = m * (a^2 - b)

Because the equations involve ratios equal to integers, we can express the conditions as:
- (a^2 + b) / (b^2 - a) = k ∈ ℤ
- (b^2 + a) / (a^2 - b) = m ∈ ℤ

We'll iterate over small (a, b) pairs, check if both ratios are integers, and if so, collect those pairs.

```python
# Enumerate small positive a, b up to 20 to find solutions satisfying the given equations
max_value = 20
solutions = set()

for a in range(1, max_value + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_value + 1):
        denom1 = b ** 2 - a
        denom2 = a ** 2 - b

        # Avoid division by zero
        if denom1 == 0 or denom2 == 0:
            continue

        val1 = a ** 2 + b
        val2 = b ** 2 + a

        # Check if ratios are integers
        if val1 % denom1 == 0 and val2 % denom2 == 0:
            k = val1 // denom1
            m = val2 // denom2
            # Store the tuple as a candidate solution
            solutions.add((a, b, k, m))
            print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, k={k}, m={m}")
```

This enumeration should help identify candidate pairs for further analysis or conjecture formation.
