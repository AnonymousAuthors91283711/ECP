[write_program]
The problem appears to involve a specific set of natural numbers `n` such that each `n` can be represented as the sum of factorials of elements from some finite set `S`, with the additional property that for distinct elements `i, j ∈ S`, their factorials are not equal (implicitly ensured if the elements are distinct). The bounds are `n > 0` and `n ≤ 240`. The task hints at enumerating these values, possibly to determine the size of such a set or specific values.

To assist, I will write a Python program that:
- Enumerates all possible sums of factorials of distinct positive integers (to avoid duplicates).
- Limits the search to factorials of numbers up to a point where the sum exceeds 240.
- Prints all such sums to determine the set size.

Here is the program:

```python
# Enumerate all sums of factorials of distinct integers up to a certain limit
# to find all n with 0 < n ≤ 240 that are sum of such factorials.

import math

def generate_factorials(limit):
    """Generate factorials of numbers until the sum exceeds 240."""
    factorials = []
    i = 1
    total = 0
    while True:
        f = math.factorial(i)
        if total + f > limit:
            break
        factorials.append(f)
        total += f
        i += 1
    return factorials

def enumerate_sums(factorials, max_sum):
    """Enumerate all sums of distinct factorials up to max_sum."""
    results = set()

    def dfs(index, current_sum):
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            return
        if current_sum > 0:
            print(current_sum)
            results.add(current_sum)
        for next_index in range(index, len(factorials)):
            # Include factorials[next_index]
            dfs(next_index + 1, current_sum + factorials[next_index])

    dfs(0, 0)
    return results

def main():
    limit = 240
    factorials = generate_factorials(limit)
    enumerate_sums(factorials, limit)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code:

- Generates factorials of integers starting from 1 until their sum exceeds 240.
- Recursively enumerates all combinations (subsets) of these factorials.
- Immediately prints each sum `n` (streaming results as required).
- Can help to pronounce all candidate values `n`, assisting in deducing the size or character of the set described in the formal theorem.

This provides all sums `n > 0` and `n ≤ 240` that fit the criteria, aiding in the analysis and proof steps.
