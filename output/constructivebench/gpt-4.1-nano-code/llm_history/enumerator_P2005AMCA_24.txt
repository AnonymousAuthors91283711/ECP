The problem appears to involve polynomials over ℝ, specifically with a polynomial P decomposed into roots at 1, 2, and 3, and a property Q related to existence of a polynomial R of degree 3 satisfying a certain relation involving P and q. The goal is to examine solutions q satisfying Q and determine their cardinality.

To approach this:

- Since P has roots 1, 2, 3, and the relation involves evaluation of P at q.eval x, implying polynomials of certain forms.
- Q asserts the existence of R with degree 3 such that P.eval (q.eval x) equals P.eval x times R.eval x.
- Since P's roots are at 1, 2, 3, and P = (X-1)(X-2)(X-3), our analysis involves the composition of polynomials and their degrees.

Given the problem's structure, solutions for q are likely to relate to the structure of polynomials that satisfy the relation. In particular:

- For q to satisfy Q, the polynomial P.eval (q.eval x) must factor as P.eval x multiplied by R.eval x, with R degree 3.
- To find possible q, we analyze the degrees involved: degree(P.eval (q.eval x)) depends on degree(q), and the degrees of involved polynomials.
- The relation suggests that q might be of degree 1 or 2, but to explore fully, we generate candidate polynomials q of degrees 0–3 with small coefficients, verify whether they satisfy the property, and count solutions.

We will generate all q with degree ≤ 2 with small integer coefficients, check the condition, and count solutions. Since the problem is algebraically rich, this enumeration can give us insights into how many such q exist.

```python
import numpy as np
from sympy import symbols, Poly, degree, expand

# Define the polynomial and the evaluation function
X = symbols('X')

# Roots of P
roots = [1, 2, 3]
# Define the polynomial P = (X - 1)(X - 2)(X - 3)
P = Poly((X - 1)*(X - 2)*(X - 3), X)

# We'll generate q with degree 0,1,2 with small coefficients
solutions = []

# Coefficients range for small q
coeff_range = range(-2, 3)

for a0 in coeff_range:
    for a1 in coeff_range:
        for a2 in coeff_range:
            # Construct q
            q_poly = Poly(a0 + a1*X + a2*X**2, X)
            deg_q = degree(q_poly)
            # Evaluate P at q.eval(x)
            # For symbolic evaluation, set y = q.eval(x)
            # The composition P.eval(q.eval(x))
            q_expr = q_poly.as_expr()
            # Compose P with q
            composed = P.as_expr().subs(X, q_expr)
            # Expand to get polynomial form
            composed_poly = Poly(expand(composed), X)
            # Check if composition is divisible by P.eval x
            # P.eval x = (X-1)(X-2)(X-3)
            # We need to verify if there exists a degree 3 polynomial R such that:
            # P.eval(q.eval x) = P.eval x * R.eval x
            # Equivalently, whether composed_poly is divisible by P
            if composed_poly.degree() >= 3:
                quotient, remainder = divmod(composed_poly, P)
                if remainder.is_zero:
                    R_poly = quotient
                    # Check if R is degree 3
                    if degree(R_poly) == 3:
                        solutions.append(q_poly)
                        print("Solution q:", q_poly.as_expr())

# Output total solutions found
print("Total solutions:", len(solutions))
