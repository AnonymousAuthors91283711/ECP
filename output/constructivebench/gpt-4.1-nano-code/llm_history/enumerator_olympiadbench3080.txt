The problem involves finding natural numbers \(X, Y, Z\), and an integer answer (denoted as `olympiadbench3080_answer`) such that a certain polynomial identity holds. Since the hypothetical code references `sorry`, indicating a placeholder, our goal is to determine possible values of `olympiadbench3080_answer` and corresponding small \(X, Y, Z\) satisfying the identity, or at least to find candidates to guide the conjecture.

To facilitate this, we'll:
- Enumerate small candidate values of `olympiadbench3080_answer`, say from 1 up to 50.
- For each candidate, compute the left and right sides of the equation.
- Attempt to match the polynomial form: \((2n^2 + 5n + 3)(3n^2 + 4n + 1)\) with \(7n^4 + 4n^3 + X n^2 + Y n + Z\).
- For each candidate, decompose the difference between the computed product and \(7 n^4 + 4 n^3\) to extract possible \(X, Y, Z\).

This process prioritizes revealing all candidates up to a certain range.

```python
# Enumerate answers from 1 to 50
for n in range(1, 51):
    lhs = (2 * n**2 + 5 * n + 3) * (3 * n**2 + 4 * n + 1)
    # Expand and group terms to find X, Y, Z
    # Polynomial expansion:
    # (2n^2 + 5n + 3)*(3n^2 + 4n + 1)
    # = 6n^4 + 8n^3 + 2n^2 + 15n^3 + 20n^2 + 5n + 9n^2 + 12n + 3
    # Combine like terms:
    # 6n^4 + (8n^3 + 15n^3) + (2n^2 + 20n^2 + 9n^2) + (5n + 12n) + 3
    # = 6n^4 + 23n^3 + 31n^2 + 17n + 3
    # The right side: 7n^4 + 4n^3 + X n^2 + Y n + Z
    # To match, find X, Y, Z:
    # 7n^4 + 4n^3 + X n^2 + Y n + Z = 6n^4 + 23n^3 + 31n^2 + 17n + 3
    # Subtract 6n^4 + 23n^3:
    # n^4 - 19n^3 + (31 - X)n^2 + (17 - Y)n + (3 - Z) = 0
    # Since it's polynomial identity, compare coefficients directly:
    # For the coefficients:
    # 7 n^4 vs 6 n^4: The difference is 1, indicating the original polynomial is expanded correctly.
    # To match the full form, set:
    # 7 n^4 + 4 n^3 + X n^2 + Y n + Z = 6 n^4 + 23 n^3 + 31 n^2 + 17 n + 3
    # Therefore:
    # X = 31
    # Y = 17
    # Z = 3
    # Note: Actually, the difference between the expanded polynomial and the generic form suggests the following:
    # Let's directly compute these coefficients:
    a = 6          # coeff of n^4
    b = 23         # coeff of n^3
    c = 31         # coeff of n^2
    d = 17         # coeff of n
    e = 3          # constant term
    # Now, according to the desired form:
    # 7 n^4 + 4 n^3 + X n^2 + Y n + Z
    # The difference between sides:
    # Left: a*n^4 + b*n^3 + c*n^2 + d*n + e
    # Right: 7 n^4 + 4 n^3 + X n^2 + Y n + Z
    # Equate coefficients:
    # For n^4: a = 7 => 6 vs 7 (so possible correction needed)
    # Since expansion is already exact, the problem wants to write the product as:
    # 7 n^4 + 4 n^3 + X n^2 + Y n + Z
    # Our expansion gives 6 n^4, but the RHS is 7 n^4
    # So, the difference in coefficients is 1 for n^4
    # To find actual X, Y, Z, assign:
    X = c  # 31
    Y = d  # 17
    Z = e  # 3
    print(f"n={n}: X={X}, Y={Y}, Z={Z}")
