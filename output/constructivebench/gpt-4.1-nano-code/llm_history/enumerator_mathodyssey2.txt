This problem appears to involve a function A defined over â„•, specifically as a product over a certain interval, and a property P involving divisibility by powers of 5. We're asked to determine the least l satisfying P, which depends on the divisibility properties of A l related to powers of 5.

Given the context, the key is to analyze the divisibility of the product over the interval [4l + 1, 4(5^5 + 1)l], focusing on powers of 5.

To assist in conjecturing, I'll implement a Python script that enumerates values of l up to a small threshold, computes the product, and inspects its divisibility by 5 powers, aiming to find the minimal l satisfying the conditions.

Since the problem involves large exponents, and to keep the enumeration manageable, we'll explore small l values, compute the product explicitly or via prime factorization (here via simulation), and check the divisibility conditions.

```python
from math import prod
from itertools import combinations

# Define parameters
max_l = 20
power_threshold = 2 * 25  # upper bound on exponent, here 50 to limit computation

# Function to compute the product over the interval
def compute_product(l):
    start = 4 * l + 1
    end = start + 4 * (5**5 + 1) * l
    return prod(range(start, end + 1))

# Function to count factors of 5 in a number
def count_factors_of_5(n):
    count = 0
    while n % 5 == 0 and n != 0:
        n //= 5
        count += 1
    return count

# Enumerate candidates for l
for l in range(max_l):
    A_value = compute_product(l)
    total_factors_5 = count_factors_of_5(A_value)
    # Check divisibility conditions
    if total_factors_5 >= 25 * l and total_factors_5 < 25 * l + 1:
        print(f"l = {l} satisfies P: 5^{25*l} divides A, but 5^{25*l+1} does not.")
        print(f"A({l}) factors of 5: {total_factors_5}")
```
