theorem omnimath2966 : 
  Finset.card (Finset.filter (fun n => 100 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 300 ∧ 5 ∣ n ∧ 7 ∣ n ∧ ¬(10 ∣ n)) (Finset.Icc 100 300)) = omnimath2966_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 105
175
245
Count: 3. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the conditions: 100 ≤ n ≤ 300, divisible by 5 and 7, but not by 10, the pattern shows numbers divisible by 35, not divisible by 10. Counting multiples of 35 within range and excluding those divisible by 10 (multiples of 70). The total count is:

Total multiples of 35 between 100 and 300: 105, 140, 175, 210, 245, 280.  
Exclude multiples of 70: 140, 210, 280.  
Remaining: 105, 175, 245.

Final answer:

<<<3>>>
