noncomputable abbrev omnimath2824_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2824 : 
  let line1 := fun x => 2 * x + 6
  let line2 := fun x => -4 * x + 6
  let x1 := -3  -- x-intercept of line1 (solution to 2x + 6 = 0)
  let x2 := 3/2 -- x-intercept of line2 (solution to -4x + 6 = 0)
  |x1 - x2| = omnimath2824_answer := by sorry
