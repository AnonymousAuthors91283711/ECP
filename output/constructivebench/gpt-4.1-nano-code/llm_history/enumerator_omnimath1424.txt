This problem involves computing a sum of factorial-based terms and finding the exact integer value that the sum evaluates to. To assist in conjecturing and confirming the answer, I will implement a Python script that:

- Enumerates the sum step-by-step, computing each factorial and partial sum immediately when determined.
- Uses integer division (equal to `//`) to ensure exact integer results, matching the problem's fractional expressions.
- Prints each result for traceability.
- Computes the entire sum in a straightforward manner, relying only on Python's built-in integer arithmetic, which is efficient for small factorials.

Here's the Python program to compute the sum:

```python
# Precompute factorials for small numbers to improve efficiency
factorials = {
    2: 2,
    3: 6,
    4: 24,
    6: 720,
    7: 5040,
    9: 362880
}

# Compute each term explicitly and print immediately
term1 = 8 * factorials[9] // (2 * 2)
print("Term 1:", term1)

term2 = 4 * factorials[7] // 2
print("Term 2:", term2)

term3 = 4 * factorials[6]
print("Term 3:", term3)

term4 = 4 * factorials[4]
print("Term 4:", term4)

term5 = factorials[3]
print("Term 5:", term5)

term6 = factorials[2]
print("Term 6:", term6)

term7 = factorials[2]
print("Term 7:", term7)

# Sum all terms
total = term1 + term2 + term3 + term4 + term5 + term6 + term7
print("Total sum:", total)

# Assign total to the answer variable
omnimath1424_answer = total
```
