theorem P2004AMCB_15 :
  ∃ (j b : ℕ),
    j < 100 ∧ b < 100 ∧
    j / 10 = b % 10 ∧ j % 10 = b / 10 ∧
    j + 5 = 2 * (b + 5) ∧
    |(j - b : ℤ)| = P2004AMCB_15_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: j=31, b=13, |j-b|=18. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern and constraints imply j = 2b + 5, with b < 100, and |j - b| = 18, hence j = b + 18. Solving b + 18 = 2b + 5 gives b = 13, j = 31. The answer for |j - b| is 18. To generalize, since j = b + 18, the absolute difference is always 18.
