. Enumerated answers: n=1, f(n)=41
n=19, f(n)=761. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern from enumerated answers at n=1 and n=19, with corresponding f(n)=41 and 761, and the polynomial definition, the answer appears to be the constant value 41. Since the sum is over n where f(n)=41, which only occurs when n=1, the sum reduces to that single term.

<<<41>>>
