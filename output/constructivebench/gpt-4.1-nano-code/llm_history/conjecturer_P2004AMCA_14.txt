  P2004AMCA_14_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 49
Minimal g3: 49
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The problem involves finding the minimal value of \( g_3 \) satisfying the given conditions. The sequence defined by common difference \( d \) and the relation \( g_2^2 = g_1 g_3 \) suggests a quadratic relation, with the minimal \( g_3 \) being 49 when the sequence is properly aligned. 

Hence, the answer is 49.

<<<49>>>
