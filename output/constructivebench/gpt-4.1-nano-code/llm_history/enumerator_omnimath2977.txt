[write_program]
This problem involves defining a custom operation `nabla(a, b) = a^b * b^a` and evaluating it for specific values. 

Since the theorem states `nabla 2 3 = omnimath2977_answer`, and the instructions are to help conjecture and verify, I'll write a program that computes the value of `nabla(2, 3)`. To ensure completeness, I'll enumerate possible values for `a` and `b` in a small range, check their `nabla` results, and print them. If the goal is only to confirm `nab_no_a=2, b=3`, then printing the exact value suffices.

Following the requirements, I will implement the enumeration in Python.

```python
# Enumerate values of nabla(a, b) for small a, b to observe patterns; focus on (2,3)
def nabla(a, b):
    return a ** b * b ** a

# Parameters chosen for small enumeration
max_a = 5
max_b = 5

# Store results in a list to print
results = []

for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_b + 1):
        value = nabla(a, b)
        print(f"nabla({a}, {b}) = {value}")
        if a == 2 and b == 3:
            # Candidate answer for the specific theorem
            candidate_answer = value

# Output the specific answer for (2,3)
print(f"nabala(2,3) = {candidate_answer}")
```
