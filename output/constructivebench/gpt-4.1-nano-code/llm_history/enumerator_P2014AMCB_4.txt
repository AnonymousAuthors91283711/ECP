This problem seems to involve algebraic manipulation and solving for the ratio \( m / b \). We are given parameters \( m, b > 0 \) and an equation involving these variables. The goal is to find the value of \( P2014AMCB_4_answer \) such that:

\[
(4m + 3b) \times 2 = 2m + 16b
\]

or equivalently:

\[
2(4m + 3b) = 2m + 16b
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
8m + 6b = 2m + 16b
\]

Bring like terms together:

\[
8m - 2m = 16b - 6b
\]

\[
6m = 10b
\]

Divide both sides by \( b \) (since \( b > 0 \)):

\[
\frac{6m}{b} = 10
\]

So,

\[
\frac{m}{b} = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

Hence,

\[
m = \frac{5}{3} b
\]

Therefore, \( P2014AMCB_4_answer = \frac{5}{3} \).

Below is a Python program that numerically verifies this ratio for various \( b > 0 \). It does so by iterating over small sample values, confirming the ratio, and printing the ratio directly.

```python
# Program to verify the ratio m/b satisfying the given algebraic equation
# The ratio should be 5/3 based on algebraic simplification

# Sample values for b > 0
sample_b_values = [1, 0.5, 2, 3]

for b in sample_b_values:
    # Compute m consistent with the ratio m/b = 5/3
    m = (5/3) * b
    # Check the original equation:
    left = 2 * (4 * m + 3 * b)
    right = 2 * m + 16 * b
    # If they are approximately equal, print the ratio
    if abs(left - right) < 1e-8:
        print(f"b = {b}, m = {m}, m/b = {m/b}")
```

This helps verify that the ratio \( m/b = 5/3 \) satisfies the equation for various positive \( b \).
