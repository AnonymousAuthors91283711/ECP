Ground Truth Answer: { (1 + Real.sqrt 5)/2, (1 - Real.sqrt 5)/2 }
Proposed Answer: { x | x = (fib 2009 + Real.sqrt ((fib 2008 : ℝ)^2 + 4)) / 2 } ∪ { x | x = (fib 2009 - Real.sqrt ((fib 2008 : ℝ)^2 + 4)) / 2 }
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. The ground truth answer gives the golden ratio and its conjugate: (1±√5)/2
2. The proposed answer uses Fibonacci numbers to express the solution

Key observations:
- The Fibonacci recurrence relation is fib(n+1) = fib(n) + fib(n-1)
- For large n, fib(n+1)/fib(n) approaches the golden ratio φ = (1+√5)/2
- The equation x² = fib(2009)/fib(2008)*x + 1 (when divided by x^2008) would approach x² = φx + 1 in the limit
- The solutions to x² = φx + 1 are indeed φ and its conjugate (1-√5)/2

However, the proposed answer is using exact Fibonacci numbers rather than their limiting behavior. While the proposed form is algebraically correct for the given equation, it's not simplified to the golden ratio form shown in the ground truth. For very large Fibonacci numbers (like fib(2009)), the two forms become numerically very close but aren't exactly identical in representation.
