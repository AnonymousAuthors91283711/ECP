Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {3}
<<<True>>>

The problem asks to find all natural numbers n such that 10^n ≤ 2014 ≤ 10^(n+1). 

Let's evaluate:
- For n=3: 10^3 = 1000 ≤ 2014 ≤ 10000 = 10^4 (true)
- For n=2: 10^2 = 100 ≤ 2014 ≤ 1000 = 10^3 (false, 2014 > 1000)
- For n=4: 10^4 = 10000 ≤ 2014 ≤ 100000 = 10^5 (false, 2014 < 10000)

Only n=3 satisfies the condition. Therefore, the proposed answer {3} is correct and equivalent to the ground truth.
