This problem involves analyzing the fractional part of a large exponential expression. We need to find the first three digits after the decimal point of \((10^{2002} + 1)^{10/7}\). Since directly computing such a huge number is impossible, we should use logarithmic approximation to find the fractional part.

Key idea:
- Let \( N = (10^{2002} + 1)^{10/7} \)
- \(\log_{10} N = \frac{10}{7} \log_{10}(10^{2002} + 1)\)
- Approximate \(\log_{10}(10^{2002} + 1) \approx 2002 + \frac{1}{10^{2002}}\) for very small correction (but since \(10^{2002}\) is extremely large, the correction is negligible).
- The integer part of \(\log_{10} N\) gives the order of magnitude; the fractional part determines the digits after the decimal point.

Therefore, we can:
- Calculate the fractional part of \(\frac{10}{7} \times 2002\) (since \(\log_{10}(10^{2002}) = 2002\))
- Multiply the fractional part by 10^3 to get the first three digits.

Here's the code implementing this:

```python
# Approximate the fractional part of (10^{2002} + 1)^{10/7}
from math import log10, floor

# Compute the main logarithm base 10 of the large number
main_log = 2002  # since log10(10^{2002}) = 2002

# log10(10^{2002} + 1) ≈ 2002 + 1/10^{2002}, negligible for large exponent
# So log10(10^{2002} + 1) ≈ main_log

# Compute fractional part of (10/7) * log10(10^{2002} + 1)
fractional_exponent = ((10/7) * main_log) % 1

# Get the first three digits after the decimal point
first_three_digits = int(fractional_exponent * 10**3)

# Print the result
print(first_three_digits)
```
