The problem involves a function \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\), continuous on \((0, \infty)\), satisfying \(f(x y) = f(x) + f(y) + 1\) for all \(x > 0, y > 0\), and \(f(2) = 0\). We need to find \(f(2015)\).

Approach:
- Analyze the functional equation under the substitution \(x=y=1\).
- Use properties such as continuity and the functional equation to find the explicit form of \(f\).
- Since the functional equation resembles a form involving logarithms plus constants, try to derive a candidate form.
- Use small sample values to verify or approximate the solution.
- The key is to recognize that \(f\) may be related to a logarithmic function.

Let's proceed to find the explicit form of \(f\):

1. Set \(x=y=1\): \(f(1) = 2f(1) + 1\) â†’ \(f(1) = -1\).
2. Assume \(f(x) = g(\ln x) + c\) for some function \(g\), since the equation involves multiplication.
3. Plug into the original: \(f(x y) = f x + f y + 1\).

Based on this pattern, the functional equation closely resembles the equation for log functions:

\[f(x y) - 1 = (f x - c) + (f y - c)\]

which suggests that \(f(x) = \ln x + K\), with \(K\) a constant.

Using \(f(2)=0\):

\[f(2) = \ln 2 + K = 0 \Rightarrow K = - \ln 2\]

So:

\[f(x) = \ln x - \ln 2 = \ln \frac{x}{2}\]

Now compute \(f(2015)\):

\[f(2015) = \ln \frac{2015}{2}\]

The answer:

```python
import math

# Derived explicit form: f(x) = ln(x/2)
# Compute f(2015)
answer = math.log(2015/2)
print("f(2015) =", answer)
```
