theorem omnimath329 (x : ℝ) (hx : 0 < x) :
    x^2 + 9 * x + 2 * sqrt (x^2 * (9 * x)) = 121 ↔ x = omnimath329_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the symmetry and form of the equation \(x^2 + 9x + 2 \sqrt{x^2 \cdot 9x} = 121\), the expression simplifies to a quadratic with a radical. Isolating \(x\), the solutions are \(x = 11\) and \(x = -11\); however, since \(x > 0\), the only valid solution is \(x=11\).  
Final answer in Lean:
<<<11>>>
