abbrev olympiadbench1681_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench1681 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
    Surjective f ∧ (∀ m n p, Prime p → (p ∣ f (m + n) ↔ p ∣ f m + f n)) ↔ f = olympiadbench1681_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: f(n) = 1*n + 0
f(n) = 2*n + 0
f(n) = 3*n + 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The pattern suggests a linear form f(n) = c * n with c in {1, 2, 3}. Since the problem involves a prime divisibility condition and surjectivity, the most compatible function is f(n) = n, which satisfies the base case and the divisibility condition (for p | f(m + n) iff p | f m + f n) naturally. 

Final answer:
<<<fun n => n>>>
