The problem involves involutive functions \(g\) satisfying \(f + g = 2x\) and \(f\) being strictly monotonic. Given the pattern and the symmetry of involutions \(g\) with \(g(g(x))=x\), the sets where \(g\) might be the identity (i.e., \(g(x)=x\)) yield \(f(x)=x\), and other involutions correspond to \(g(x)=-x\) with \(f(x)=-x\). These are the primary candidates. 

Thus, the functions \(f(x)\) are either the identity \(x\) or the negation \(-x\), which are both strictly monotonic.

<<<{x | True}>>>

This set includes both \(f(x)=x\) and \(f(x)=-x\); considering the strict monotonicity only holds for \(f(x)=x\), the answer set reduces to just the identity function.
