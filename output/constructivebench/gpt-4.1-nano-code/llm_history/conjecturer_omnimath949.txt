Let's analyze the problem: permutations of ùîñ‚ÇÜ with exactly one fixed point. There are 6 possible fixed points (selecting one element to be fixed). The remaining 5 elements permute with no fixed points (derangements of 5 elements). Number of derangements of n: !n = round(n! / e), which for 5 is 44.

Total permutations with exactly one fixed point: 6 * 44 = 264.

Total permutations in ùîñ‚ÇÜ: 6! = 720.

Probability: 264 / 720 = 11 / 30.

Thus, the answer:

<<<(11/30 : ‚Ñö)>>>
