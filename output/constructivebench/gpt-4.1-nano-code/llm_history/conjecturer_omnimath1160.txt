The problem seeks the minimal n such that for any p, q with p + q ≤ 2016, there exists a set s of size n containing subsets summing to p and q. Given the constraints, to cover all sums p+q ≤ 2016 with minimal |s|, the set must be sufficiently large to partition into subsets summing to p and q. The minimal such number is 64, which guarantees the required decompositions.
