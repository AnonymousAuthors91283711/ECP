The problem involves finding all pairs of primes (p, q) such that \( 3 p^{q-1} + 1 \) divides \( 11^p + 17^p \). To approach this, I will:

- Select small prime values for p and q (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) to keep computations manageable.
- Enumerate all small prime pairs (p, q).
- Test the divisibility condition for each pair.
- Output all pairs satisfying the condition.

This will help observe patterns, possibly leading to a conjecture or pattern involving the prime pairs satisfying the divisibility.

```python
from sympy import primerange, isprime

# Generate small primes for testing
primes = list(primerange(2, 20))
results = []

# Enumerate all pairs of primes with small values
for p in primes:
    for q in primes:
        # Compute numerator: 3 * p**(q-1) + 1
        numerator = 3 * p ** (q - 1) + 1
        # Compute denominator: 11^p + 17^p
        denom = 11 ** p + 17 ** p
        # Check divisibility
        if denom % numerator == 0:
            results.append((p, q))
            print((p, q))
# Show total number of solutions
print("Total solutions:", len(results))
```
