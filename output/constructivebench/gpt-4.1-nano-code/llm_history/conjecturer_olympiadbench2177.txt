theorem olympiadbench2177 :
  IsLeast {k : ℕ | 0 < k ∧ 
    ∃ (color : ℕ → Fin k) (f : ℕ → ℕ),
      (∀ m n, color m = color n → f (m + n) = f m + f n) ∧
      ∃ m n, f (m + n) ≠ f m + f n} olympiadbench2177_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: timeout triggered. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the conditions, the minimal number of colors k is 2, to distinguish between additive and non-additive functions, with the minimal such k being 2. The non-additive functions can exist with 2 colors, and any fewer will not suffice.
