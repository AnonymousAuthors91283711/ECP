theorem omnimath2172 :
  ∑ k in Finset.range 2019, |(pascal_triangle 2018 k : ℝ)| / Nat.choose 2018 k = omnimath2172_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=1, sum=2.0
n=2, sum=3.0
n=4, sum=5.0
n=8, sum=9.0
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the pattern in enumerated answers (2, 3, 5, 9) and the input k (from 0 to 2018), the sum resembles 1 plus the 2^n pattern, especially considering Pascal's Triangle and absolute values. The sums seem to double and then adjust by 1.

Thus, for n=2018, the sum is 2^{2018} + 1.
