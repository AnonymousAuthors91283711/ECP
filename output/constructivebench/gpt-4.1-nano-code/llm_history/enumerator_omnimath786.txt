This problem involves exploring solutions to the equation:

\[ e^{x \log 2} + e^{x^3 \log 2} = 2 e^{x^2 \log 2} \]

which simplifies to:

\[ 2^x + 2^{x^3} = 2 \cdot 2^{x^2} \]

Because the parameters involved are exponentials of powers of \( x \), a practical approach is to check for candidate solutions over small ranges, especially rational or integer values, to gather evidence. 

Since the challenge involves an equivalence statement: the solutions to the equation coupled with a condition involving the inequality of these exponentials, the goal is to find all such \( x \) satisfying the first, and then distinguish which of these satisfy or don't satisfy the inequalities.

We will examine small integer and rational values systematically, print solutions immediately when found, and then identify the special solutions with properties matching the inequalities. We’ll limit enumeration for efficiency.

```python
import math

def exprs(x):
    # Compute terms in the equation
    a = 2 ** x
    b = 2 ** (x ** 3)
    c = 2 ** (x ** 2)
    return a + b, 2 * c, a, c, b

# Define a function to check the key equation
def check_equation(x, tol=1e-12):
    left, right, a, c, b = exprs(x)
    return abs(left - right) < tol

# Generate candidate x values over small range
candidates = [x/10 for x in range(-50, 51)]  # from -5 to 5 in steps of 0.1

for x in candidates:
    if check_equation(x):
        print(f"Candidate solution x={x:.2f}")
        a_val, c_val, a, c, b = exprs(x)
        print(f"  2^{x:.2f} = {a:.4f}")
        print(f"  2^{x**3:.2f} = {b:.4f}")
        print(f"  2^{x**2:.2f} = {c:.4f}")
        # Check inequalities
        neq1 = a != c
        neq2 = c != b
        if neq1 or neq2:
            print(f"  Inequalities hold: ({a:.4f} ≠ {c:.4f}) or ({c:.4f} ≠ {b:.4f})")
        else:
            print("  All exponential terms are equal.")
```
