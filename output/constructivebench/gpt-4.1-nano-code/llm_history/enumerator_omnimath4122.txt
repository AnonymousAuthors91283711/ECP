The problem resembles a Diophantine equation involving Fibonacci numbers: find positive integers p.1 and p.2 such that 5*F(p.1) - 3*F(p.2) = 1, where F is the Fibonacci sequence with initial conditions F(1)=1, F(2)=1, and F(n+1)=F(n)+F(n-1).

Since Fibonacci numbers grow rapidly, and the coefficients 5 and 3 are small, we can limit the search to some reasonable small range, say up to 30, to find potential solutions.

The Python script enumerates over pairs of positive integers within this range, computes the Fibonacci numbers, checks the linear combination, and prints pairs that satisfy the equation.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    # Generate Fibonacci number for n (1-based index)
    a, b = 1, 1
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    for _ in range(3, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b

max_n = 30
for p1 in range(1, max_n + 1):
    F_p1 = fibonacci(p1)
    for p2 in range(1, max_n + 1):
        F_p2 = fibonacci(p2)
        if 5 * F_p1 - 3 * F_p2 == 1:
            print((p1, p2))
```
