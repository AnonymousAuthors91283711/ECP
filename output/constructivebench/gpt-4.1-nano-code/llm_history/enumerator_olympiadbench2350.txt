The problem asks us to count how many integers \(k\) between 1 and 2014 satisfy \(f(k) \equiv 1 \pmod{10}\), where

\[f(n) = \binom{n + 4}{4} - \begin{cases} 0, & n < 2 \\ \binom{n + 3}{3}, & n \ge 2 \end{cases}\].

We will implement this directly with Python, iterate over \(k=1\) to \(2014\), compute \(f(k)\), check the condition mod 10, and count.

Because the main challenge is to determine the count, the code will:

- Define a function `f(n)`.
- Loop through 1 to 2014.
- For each `k`, compute `f(k)`.
- Check if `f(k) % 10 == 1`.
- Keep track of the count and print each satisfying value immediately.

This approach is efficient for the problem size and directly implements the enumeration.

```python
from math import comb

def f(n):
    if n < 2:
        return comb(n + 4, 4)
    else:
        return comb(n + 4, 4) - comb(n + 3, 3)

count = 0
for k in range(1, 2015):
    val = f(k)
    if val % 10 == 1:
        count += 1
        print(f"k={k}, f(k)={val}")
print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
