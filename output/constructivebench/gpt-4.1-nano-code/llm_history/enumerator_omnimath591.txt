The problem asks for the number of positive divisors \(d\) of \(15!\) such that \(\gcd(d, 60) = 5\). To do this, we need to:

1. Factor \(15!\) into primes.
2. Find all divisors \(d\) of \(15!\).
3. Filter those where \(\gcd(d, 60) = 5\).
4. Count them.

Since \(15!\) is large but manageable with prime factorization up to 13, we will enumerate divisors and check the gcd condition.

**Prime factors of \(15!\):**

- Count the exponents of primes \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\) in \(15!\).

Calculate exponents:
- exponent of prime \(p\) in \(n!\) = \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \lfloor n / p^k \rfloor\).

For \(15!\):

- For \(2\):
  \(\lfloor 15/2 \rfloor + \lfloor 15/4 \rfloor + \lfloor 15/8 \rfloor + \lfloor 15/16 \rfloor = 7 + 3 + 1 + 0 = 11\).

- For \(3\):
  \(\lfloor 15/3 \rfloor + \lfloor 15/9 \rfloor = 5 + 1 = 6\).

- For \(5\):
  \(\lfloor 15/5 \rfloor + \lfloor 15/25 \rfloor = 3 + 0 = 3\).

- For \(7\):
  \(\lfloor 15/7 \rfloor = 2\).

- For \(11\):
  \(\lfloor 15/11 \rfloor = 1\).

- For \(13\):
  \(\lfloor 15/13 \rfloor = 1\).

Divisors \(d\) are of the form:
\[
d = 2^{a} 3^{b} 5^{c} 7^{e} 11^{f} 13^{g}
\]
where:
- \(0 \leq a \leq 11\),
- \(0 \leq b \leq 6\),
- \(0 \leq c \leq 3\),
- \(0 \leq e \leq 2\),
- \(0 \leq f,g \leq 1\).

The gcd condition:
\[
\gcd(d, 60) = 5 \implies \gcd(d, 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5) = 5
\]
which implies:
- \(d\) shares exactly one factor of \(5\),
- \(d\) is not divisible by 2 or 3,
- \(d\) can have factors of 2 or 3 only if they are not common with 60 such that gcd is exactly 5.

To get \(\gcd(d, 60) = 5\):
- \(c \geq 1\) (must include a factor of 5),
- \(a\) (power of 2) must be zero or only contribute factors that do not affect gcd being 5 (so \(a\) can be 0),
- \(b\) (power of 3) can be zero (since gcd must be exactly 5, not divisible by 3).

Since gcd is 5, \(d\) cannot include additional factors of 2 or 3 that would make gcd larger than 5. Specifically:
- \(a\) can be 0 or 1, since having \(a \geq 2\) gives common factor 4 or higher.
- \(b=0\) to ensure gcd remains 5 (not divisible by 3).
- \(c \geq 1\) (must include 5).
- \(e,f,g\) can be 0 or 1, independent.

Finally, the enumeration:

```python
# Counting divisors d of 15! with gcd(d, 60) = 5:
# Conditions:
# - c >= 1 (must have 5)
# - a in {0,1} to avoid gcd > 5
# - b = 0
# - e, f, g in {0,1}

counts = 0
for a in [0,1]:
    for c in range(1, 4):  # c=1..3
        b = 0
        for e in [0,1]:
            for f in [0,1]:
                for g in [0,1]:
                    counts += 1
                    print(f"Divisor with exponents: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, e={e}, f={f}, g={g}")
print("Total count:", counts)
# The total count will be the answer to the card.
```

This code enumerates all divisors of \(15!\) with the gcd condition, immediately printing each, and tallying the total. The total `counts` is the answer.
