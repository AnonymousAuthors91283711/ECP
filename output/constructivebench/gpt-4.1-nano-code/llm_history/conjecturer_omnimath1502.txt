theorem omnimath1502 :
  IsLeast {d : ℕ | ∃ (f : ℤ[X]), f.content = 1 ∧ degree f = d ∧ 
    ∀ n : ℕ, 85 ∣ f.eval (n : ℤ)} omnimath1502_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 2. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem asks for the minimal degree d of a polynomial f with content 1, degree d, where 85 divides f evaluated at all natural numbers n.

Since 85 = 5 * 17, and the polynomial's evaluations are divisible by 85, the polynomial must be constructed such that f(n) ≡ 0 mod 85 for all n. The polynomial can be built from factors to ensure divisibility, especially incorporating linear factors related to 5 and 17.

From the pattern of the enumerated answers and the minimal degree, the smallest degree for such a polynomial is 2, reflecting a polynomial that encodes divisibility conditions for both primes simultaneously.
