Based on pattern, the sum of complex roots of unity over a full cycle (0 to n) equals 0 when n ≥ 1; here n=2009. The sum of \( i^{th} \) powers of \( \omega = \Complex.I \), a primitive 4th root of unity, over a full period simplifies: sum is 0 unless 4 divides (i+1). For i in 0..2009, sum of \( \omega^i \) over a complete cycle is 0 due to symmetry.
