The problem asks to find the value of \(a\) satisfying the equation \(\frac{3a - 7}{a - 2} = 2\). To assist in conjecturing the exact value, I will solve the algebraic equation systematically, avoiding hardcoded answers and providing a stream of candidates and the solution process.

```python
# Enumerate possible solutions to the equation (3a - 7)/(a - 2) = 2
# by solving algebraically. We consider restrictions like a â‰  2 to avoid division by zero.

# List of potential candidates based on solving the equation algebraically
candidates = []

# Original equation: (3a - 7)/(a - 2) = 2
# Cross-multiplied form: 3a - 7 = 2(a - 2)
# Expand: 3a - 7 = 2a - 4
# Bring all to one side: 3a - 2a = -4 + 7 => a = 3
print("Trying candidate: a = 3")
if 3 != 2:
    # Verify solution
    lhs = (3*3 - 7)/(3 - 2)
    print(f"Test a=3: (3*3 - 7)/(3 - 2) = {lhs}")
    if abs(lhs - 2) < 1e-9:
        candidates.append(3)

# List of all candidates
for a in candidates:
    print(f"Candidate solution: a = {a}")

# The algebraic solution yields a=3, which satisfies the equation
# No extraneous solutions arise from this linear equation
```
