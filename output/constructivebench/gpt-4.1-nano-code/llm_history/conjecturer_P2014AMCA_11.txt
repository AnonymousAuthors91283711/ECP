abbrev P2014AMCA_11_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2014AMCA_11 :
  ∃! (d : ℝ), 0 < d ∧
  let v1 := 35;
  let v2 := v1 + 15;
  let d1 := v1 * 1;
  let d2 := d - d1;
  let t2 := d2 / v2;
  let total_time := 1 + t2;
  let scheduled_time := d / v1 - 1;
  total_time = scheduled_time - 0.5 ∧
  d = P2014AMCA_11_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: d = 210, total_time = 4.5, scheduled_time = 5.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the enumerated answers, the key is that \( d = 210 \) matches the total_time \( 4.5 \) when computed with \( v1=35 \), \( v2=50 \). The calculation aligns with the constraints, confirming a unique \( d \). The resultant value in closed form, based on pattern matching and the algebraic structure, is \( 6 \times 35 \).
