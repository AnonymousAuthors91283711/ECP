[write_program]
This problem involves a function property P with a specific functional equation, and the goal seems to be to identify or characterize functions satisfying P, possibly leading to a certain subset of functions with additional properties. The core task is to enumerate functions that satisfy P and the associated cardinality condition, then analyze or list them for the proof or conjecture.

Since the actual formal proof is not given (`sorry` placeholders), I will write a Python program that:

- Enumerates simple functions f: ℝ → ℝ with possibly finite support (since the problem involves the zero set's cardinality).
- Checks the key functional equation for sample functions.
- Uses small parameters and straightforward function forms for efficiency.
- Streams answers immediately upon verification.
- Focuses on polynomial or simple piecewise functions, given the algebraic nature of the problem.

Assuming polynomials or finite support functions with zeros at specific points could satisfy the equation, here's a minimal enumeration routine exploring simple polynomial-like functions and their zero sets.

```python
# Enumerate simple polynomial-like functions over a small domain
# with known zeros, to check the functional equation:
# f(x^4 + y) = x^3 * f(x) + f(f(y))
# For simplicity, test constants and linear functions first,
# then extend to some quadratic examples.

import itertools

# Define test functions: constants and polynomials up to degree 2
def constant_fun(c):
    return lambda x: c

def linear_fun(a, b):
    return lambda x: a * x + b

def quadratic_fun(a, b, c):
    return lambda x: a * x**2 + b * x + c

# Zero set cardinality
def zero_set_size(f, domain):
    return sum(1 for x in domain if abs(f(x)) < 1e-8)

# Sample domain for testing
domain = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]

# Check if f satisfies the functional equation approximately
def check_f_eq(f):
    for x in domain:
        for y in domain:
            left = f(x**4 + y)
            right = x**3 * f(x) + f(f(y))
            if abs(left - right) > 1e-6:
                return False
    return True

# Enumerate potential functions
for c in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    f = constant_fun(c)
    zero_card = zero_set_size(f, domain)
    print(f"Constant f={c}, zero set size={zero_card}")
    if check_f_eq(f):
        print("Matches functional equation.")
    else:
        print("Does not match.")

for a, b in itertools.product([-1, 0, 1], repeat=2):
    f = linear_fun(a, b)
    zero_card = zero_set_size(f, domain)
    print(f"Linear f={a}x+{b}, zero set size={zero_card}")
    if check_f_eq(f):
        print("Matches functional equation.")
    else:
        print("Does not match.")

# Could try quadratic functions similarly with small integer coefficients
# but limit to linear and constants for efficiency.
```

This code efficiently explores a manageable set of candidate functions, streams partial results, prioritizes exact matches, and can be extended further if needed.
