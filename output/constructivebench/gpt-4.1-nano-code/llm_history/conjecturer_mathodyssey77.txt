  (seq : ℕ → ℕ) (hseq : ∀ n, seq n = if n = 0 then a else if n = 1 then b else seq (n-2) + seq (n-1))
  (h7 : seq 6 = 120) : seq 7 = mathodyssey77_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: a = 35, b = 3 => seq 7 = 199
a = 30, b = 6 => seq 7 = 198
a = 25, b = 9 => seq 7 = 197
a = 20, b = 12 => seq 7 = 196
a = 15, b = 15 => seq 7 = 195
a = 10, b = 18 => seq 7 = 194
a = 5, b = 21 => seq 7 = 193
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests seq 7 decreases by 1 for each additional 3 units b increases over a, starting from (a,b) = (35,3). For seq 6=120, only (a,b) = (35,3) fits the pattern, yielding seq 7=199. Therefore, the answer is a constant related to these initial conditions. The base case and the sequence suggest seq 7 = 199 regardless of the specific a, b satisfying the given constraints.
