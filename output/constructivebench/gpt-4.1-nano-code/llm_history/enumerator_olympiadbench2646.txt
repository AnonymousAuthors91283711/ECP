The problem involves finding the smallest possible value of `s` where there are two sequences `a i` and `b i`, both arithmetic with integer steps `da` and `db`, such that `a 20 + b 14 = 1000`, `b 20 + a 14 = s`, and the sequences are never equal at any index. To efficiently explore the options, we will enumerate small values of `da` and `db`, generate candidate sequences, check the conditions, and keep track of the minimal `s`. 

Here's a small sample range for `da` and `db` (say, from 0 to 10), and for each combination, calculate `a i`, `b i`, ensure the sequences are distinct at all steps, and find the minimal `s`.

```python
# Enumerate small integer steps for the arithmetic sequences.
# For each pair of steps (da, db), generate sequences a and b.
# Check the conditions, ensure sequences are never equal at the same index.
# Record the minimal s = b(20) + a(14).

min_s = None  # To keep track of the least s found
best_params = None

for da in range(11):
    for db in range(11):
        # To solve for initial terms a0 and b0:
        # a20 = a0 + 20*da
        # b20 = b0 + 20*db
        # a14 = a0 + 14*da
        # b14 = b0 + 14*db
        # Conditions:
        # a20 + b14 = 1000
        # b20 + a14 = s (we seek minimal s)
        # From above:
        # (a0 + 20*da) + (b0 + 14*db) = 1000
        # (b0 + 20*db) + (a0 + 14*da) = s

        # Simplify:
        # a0 + b0 = 1000 - 20*da - 14*db
        # a0 + b0 = s - 20*db - 14*da (since from second equation's rearrangement)

        # Let's pick a0 freely, then b0 depends:
        # a0 = free parameter, then:
        # b0 = 1000 - 20*da - 14*db - a0

        for a0 in range(0, 1001):  # Limit to reasonable search space
            b0 = 1000 - 20*da - 14*db - a0
            # If b0 negative, skip as initial term probably should be non-negative
            if b0 < 0:
                continue

            # Generate sequences a and b
            a_seq = [a0 + i*da for i in range(21)]
            b_seq = [b0 + i*db for i in range(21)]

            # Check sequences are never equal at the same index
            if any(a_seq[i] == b_seq[i] for i in range(21)):
                continue

            s_candidate = b_seq[14] + a_seq[20]
            if min_s is None or s_candidate < min_s:
                min_s = s_candidate
                best_params = (a0, b0, da, db)

# Output the minimal s found
if min_s is not None:
    print(min_s)
```
