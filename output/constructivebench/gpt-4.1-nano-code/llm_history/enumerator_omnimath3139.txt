This problem involves algebraic manipulation and substitution using the provided equalities. We need to find \( x \) in terms of \( u \), then substitute \( u = -6 \), and determine the actual value of \( x \). To assist quotient and radical conjectures, we will compute possible values of \( x \) by enumerating plausible \( u \) values around the given substitution, then confirm the value explicitly at \( u = -6 \).

```python
# Enumerate candidate u-values around the target u = -6 to verify the algebraic relation
candidate_us = [-7, -6, -5, -4, -3]

# Calculate corresponding x values for each candidate u
for u in candidate_us:
    x = (1/3)*(3 - 4*u)
    print(f"u = {u}, x = {x}")

# Confirm the specific value at u = -6
u_target = -6
x_target = (1/3)*(3 - 4*u_target)
print(f"At u = {u_target}, x = {x_target}")
```
