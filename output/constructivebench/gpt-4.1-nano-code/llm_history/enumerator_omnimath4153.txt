This problem appears to involve functions \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) that are twice continuously differentiable (\(ContDiff \,\mathbb{R}\ 2\)), satisfying the functional equation \(f(7x + 1) = 49 f(x)\) for all \(x\). We need to find or characterize these functions.

The key steps:
- Recognize the functional equation relates the function values at scaled and shifted points.
- It resembles a form of Cauchy-like functional equations with scaling.
- Because \(f\) is twice differentiable, solutions will be of a specific form (likely polynomial or exponential).

Approach to enumerate solutions:
- For such functional equations with linear transformation \(x \mapsto 7x + 1\), solutions are often exponential functions \(f(x) = c \cdot e^{k x}\) or polynomials.
- Substituting \(f(x) = e^{k x}\), the equation becomes:
  
  \(e^{k (7x + 1)} = 49 e^{k x}\)
  
  which simplifies to:
  
  \(e^{7k x + k} = 49 e^{k x}\)
  
  or
  
  \(e^{7k x} \cdot e^{k} = 49 e^{k x}\),
  
  so
  
  \(e^{k} \cdot e^{7k x} = 49 e^{k x}\),
  
  dividing both sides by \(e^{k x}\):
  
  \(e^{k} \cdot e^{6k x} = 49\),
  
  which must hold for all \(x\), implying \(e^{6k x}\) is constant, so \(k = 0\) or \(f\) is polynomial.

- For \(k = 0\), \(f\) is constant. The constant \(f\) must satisfy:

  \(f(7x + 1) = 49 f(x)\)

  substituting \(f(x) = c\):
  
  \(c = 49 c\iff c(1 - 49) = 0 \implies c = 0\).
  
- So the only constant solution is \(f \equiv 0\).

- Consider polynomial solutions:
  Assume \(f\) is polynomial of degree \(n\). The functional equation constrains the form of \(f\). Because \(f\) is twice differentiable, polynomial solutions are compatible.

- Suppose \(f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c\). We analyze the functional equation:

  \(f(7x + 1) = 49 f(x)\).

Substituting:

  \(a (7x + 1)^2 + b (7x + 1) + c = 49 (a x^2 + b x + c)\).

Expanding:

  \(a (49 x^2 + 14 x + 1) + 7 b x + b + c = 49 a x^2 + 49 b x + 49 c\).

Simplify:

  \(49 a x^2 + 14 a x + a + 7 b x + b + c = 49 a x^2 + 49 b x + 49 c\).

Group terms:

  - \(x^2\): \(49 a x^2\) on both sides, cancel.
  - \(x\): \(14 a x + 7 b x = (14 a + 7 b) x\), should equal \(49 b x\).

So:

  \(14 a + 7 b = 49 b \implies 14 a = 42 b \implies a = 3 b\).

- Constant terms:

  \(a + b + c = 49 c\).

Substitute \(a=3 b\):

  \(3 b + b + c = 49 c \implies 4 b + c = 49 c \implies 4 b = 48 c \implies c = \frac{b}{12}\).

- Therefore, polynomial solutions are parameterized as:

  \(f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c = 3 b x^2 + b x + \frac{b}{12} = b (3 x^2 + x + \frac{1}{12})\).

- For \(f\) to be twice differentiable (which polynomials are), these are valid solutions for any \(b\).

- The trivial zero solution corresponds to \(b=0\).

- The general family:

  \(f_b(x) = b(3 x^2 + x + 1/12)\).

- For a minimal enumerated set, pick small integer values for \(b\), e.g., \(b = -1, 0, 1\).

---

Below is a Python program that enumerates these solutions for \(b\) in \(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\) and outputs their explicit formulas.

```python
# Enumerate solutions for f(x) = b * (3 x^2 + x + 1/12) for small integer b
# These satisfy the functional equation and are twice differentiable.

# Choose small integer parameters for b
for b in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    # Define the polynomial expression
    def f(x):
        return b * (3 * x**2 + x + 1/12)
    # Print the expression with the current parameter b
    print(f"b = {b}: f(x) = {b} * (3 * x^2 + x + 1/12)")
```
