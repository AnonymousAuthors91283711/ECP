Value: 925. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The patterns suggest that the expression is a polynomial in \(a, b, c\) involving fixed bases 14, 15, and 6, with the key relation \(a * 14^2 + b * 14 + c = a * 15^2 + c * 15 + b\). Simplifying this yields a relation \(a=4\), consistent with the enumeration, leading to the value \(a * 14^2 + b * 14 + c = 925\).

. Enumerated Answers: Solution: a=4, b=10, c=1
Value: 925. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The error arises because `abbrev P2018AIMEI_2_answer : ℕ := fun a b c => 4 * 14^2 + 10 * 14 + 1` is attempting to define an `ℕ` (natural number) as a function from `a`, `b`, `c`, which makes the type mismatch. Since the problem's existential statement involves specific `a`, `b`, `c`, and an explicit value, the `P2018AIMEI_2_answer` should be a fixed value, not a function.

Given the enumerated answer (a=4, b=10, c=1), the calculated value is `925`. The minimal fix is to assign `P2018AIMEI_2_answer` directly to that number, not as a function of variables. 

Likewise, the actual value that satisfies the problem constraints can be explicitly defined as 925.

**Conjectured answer:**
<<<925>>>
