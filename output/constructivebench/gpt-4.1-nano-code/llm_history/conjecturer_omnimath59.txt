Total approximate solutions: 100891344545564193334812497256. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem is to find the total number of solutions for sequences x : Fin 100 → ℤ, with each x_i between 1 and 2017 inclusive, such that the sum and the sum of squares are divisible by 2017. Based on the analysis, the solutions are constructed by considering only the values 1 and 2017, which satisfy the divisibility conditions (since 1 and 2017 are both congruent to 1 mod 2017 or 0, simplifying the divisibility constraints). The total number of such solutions is then 2^100, arising from choosing each x_i to be either 1 or 2017 independently.

The previous name “omnimath59_answer” is intended to store this value. In Lean, the error in the current code is because the expression is given as a natural language explanation rather than a proper formal expression defining a natural number. To fix it, I will set the answer to 2^100 without description text, ensuring Lean accepts it as a natural number.

Thus, the corrected answer should be:
<<<2^100>>>
