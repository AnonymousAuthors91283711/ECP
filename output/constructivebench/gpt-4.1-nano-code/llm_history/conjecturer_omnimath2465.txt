The constraints imply n is divisible by 10, with digits decreasing from left to right for the first 9 digits, each between 1 and 9, and n ≥ 10^9. The smallest such n is when digits are 9 down to 1, forming 9876543210, followed by zeros. The total count of such numbers is 1, given the fixed decreasing pattern starting from 9 down to 1, then zeros to reach ≥ 10^9. Thus, answer is 1.
