Given the problem involves a recursive sequence defined for natural numbers with certain conditions and a known value equality, we want to explore possible solutions for `a k`, especially focusing on the values at the boundary points. To assist conjecture, we'll generate candidate values for `a k` within the specified range, analyzing the recursive relation and the equality condition for `a 20` and `a 23`.

Since the sequence is defined via a recurrence involving division and the sequence values are positive, typical solutions might involve constant or linear sequences, or specific patterns arising from the recursive relation.

Here's a Python program that:
- Assumes small sample parameters (since the actual problem doesn't specify initial `a` values),
- Explores possible `a k` values that satisfy the recurrence at points 20 and 23,
- Checks for possible constellations where `a 20 = a 23`,
- Prints candidates that satisfy the conditions.

```python
# Enumerate plausible `a` values for k=1..24 to find sequences satisfying the recursive relation and the condition a(20)=a(23)
# We analyze small candidate values to observe possible solutions.
# Since the recurrence involves division, avoid zero denominators and focus on positive values.
# We will test a simple range of positive rational values for initial conditions.

from fractions import Fraction

# Sample candidate initial values for a(1)
candidate_values = [Fraction(n, d) for n in range(1, 4) for d in range(1, 4)]  # 1, 2, 3, 1/2, 3/2, 1/3, ...

# Store sequences that satisfy the relation at k=20 and k=23
valid_sequences = []

for a1 in candidate_values:
    a_seq = [a1]
    # Generate sequence up to k=24, using recurrence:
    # a(k) = (k * a(k-1)) / (a(k-1) - (k-1))
    for k in range(2, 25):
        prev = a_seq[-1]
        denom = prev - (k - 1)
        if denom == 0:
            break  # avoid division by zero
        a_k = Fraction(k * prev, denom)
        if a_k <= 0:
            break  # sequence should remain positive
        a_seq.append(a_k)
    else:
        # Sequence generated successfully, check condition at k=20 and 23
        if abs(a_seq[19] - a_seq[22]) < Fraction(1, 10**6):
            # Convert to float for easier interpretation
            print(f"Initial a(1)={float(a1):.3f}: a(20)={float(a_seq[19]):.3f}, a(23)={float(a_seq[22]):.3f}")
            valid_sequences.append((a_seq[19], a_seq[22], a_seq))
# Output the sequences found
if not valid_sequences:
    print("No sequences found matching a_{20} = a_{23} with tested initial values.")
```
