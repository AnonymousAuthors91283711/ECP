Total sum: 630. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern of values and the sum, the answer set comprises numbers between 10 and 99 with non-zero digits dividing the number. The sum of these numbers is 630. The pattern suggests the total sum is \( \sum_{k} k \). The sum 630 corresponds to the sum of all two-digit multiples of both digits. The answer is 630.

<<<630>>>

This sum matches the total sum given and aligns with the divisibility pattern of two-digit numbers with non-zero digits dividing the numbers.
