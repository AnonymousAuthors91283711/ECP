  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ Nat.choose (n + 2) 2 = Nat.choose n 2 + T} olympiadbench2799_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 37. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the enumerated answer 37 and the pattern of the binomial coefficients involved, the answer corresponds to n = 37. The problem's set describes n where the equation holds, and for the given T = 75, the minimal such n is 37.
