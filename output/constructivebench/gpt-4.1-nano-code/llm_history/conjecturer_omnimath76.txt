theorem omnimath76 : 
  IsGreatest {C : ℝ | ∀ (n : ℕ), n ≥ 2 → ∃ (x : Fin n → ℝ), (∀ i, x i ∈ Set.Icc (-1) 1) ∧ 
    (∏ i in univ, ∏ j in univ.filter (· > i), (x i - x j)) ≥ C ^ (n * (n - 1) / 2)} omnimath76_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Points: -1, 1, product: 2, C: 2.0
Points: 1, -1, product: 2, C: 2.0
Max C candidate for n=2: 2.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern indicates the maximum \(C\) is achieved when the points are at the endpoints \(-1, 1\), giving a product of 2, suggesting the maximum is 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.
