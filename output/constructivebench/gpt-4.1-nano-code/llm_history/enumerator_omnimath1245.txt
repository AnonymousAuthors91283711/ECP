This problem involves expressing a fixed rational number as a sum of three rational fractions with integer numerators constrained within given intervals, and then selecting the sum a + b for the minimal such representation.

To tackle this, I will iterate over integer candidates for `a` and `b` in their respective intervals, compute the corresponding `c` to satisfy the equation, check whether `c` is an integer, and record the sum `a + b`. 

Since the intervals are small, I'll limit the search and directly output all plausible solutions, focusing on the minimal sum `a + b`.

```python
# Enumerate all possible integer a in [0,4]
# and integer b in [0,12],
# then solve for c as c = 31*(1/2015 - a/5 - b/13),
# check if c is integer, record solutions, and print each
# We seek the minimal a + b satisfying conditions.

def main():
    results = []
    for a in range(0, 5):  # a in [0,4]
        for b in range(0, 13):  # b in [0,12]
            numerator_c = 31 * (1/2015 - a /5 - b /13)
            c = numerator_c
            # Check if c is close to an integer within a tolerance
            c_int = round(c)
            if abs(c - c_int) < 1e-9:
                sum_ab = a + b
                # Output each candidate
                print(f'a={a}, b={b}, c={c_int}, sum={sum_ab}')
                results.append((sum_ab, a, b, c_int))
    if results:
        min_sum = min(r[0] for r in results)
        # Print the minimal sum answer
        print(f'Minimum sum a + b: {min_sum}')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
