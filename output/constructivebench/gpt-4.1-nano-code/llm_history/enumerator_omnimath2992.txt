[write_program]
This problem involves set theory and combinatorics, specifically about intersections of finite sets with given sizes. The goal is to understand the possible intersection sizes among three sets with fixed individual sizes, and to compute the difference between the supremum and infimum of such intersection sizes, which relates to inclusion-exclusion principles.

To help with conjecturing and proof, the program will systematically enumerate feasible intersection sizes based on the given constraints, using small parameters for manageable enumeration. The key insight is that the maximum intersection size (x) can be as large as the minimum of the set sizes (since intersection can't be larger than any one set), and the minimum intersection size (y) can be as small as zero (no intersection).

```python
# Enumerate possible intersection sizes for three sets with fixed sizes
# in a universe of given total. For simplicity, choose small total.
def main():
    total = 10   # total number of elements in the universe
    dog = 4      # size of set A
    cat = 5      # size of set B
    turtle = 3   # size of set C
    max_intersection = min(dog, cat, turtle)

    # The minimal intersection can be zero (disjoint sets).
    possible_intersections = range(0, max_intersection + 1)

    # Enumerate all feasible intersection sizes
    for intersection in possible_intersections:
        # Check feasibility based on the inclusion-exclusion bounds
        max_possible = min(dog, cat, turtle)
        min_possible = max(0, dog + cat + turtle - 2 * total)
        if min_possible <= intersection <= max_possible:
            print(intersection)

    # The difference between maximum and minimum intersection sizes
    x = max_intersection
    y = 0
    print(f"Difference (x - y): {x - y}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
