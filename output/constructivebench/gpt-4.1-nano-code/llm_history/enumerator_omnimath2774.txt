This problem appears to involve finding the minimal number of elements n in a multiset s of elements from {0,1,2,3}, satisfying certain count constraints, such that at least one of the counts reaches or exceeds 3. We want to determine the least such total size n, with the counts respecting the maximum constraints, and the total counts summing to n.

Given the constraints:
- count 0 ≤ 13
- count 1 ≤ 5
- count 2 ≤ 1
- count 3 ≤ 9
- total count sums to n
- At least one count ≥ 3

To do this efficiently, we'll enumerate all feasible combinations with counts within the provided maxima, check for the minimal total n satisfying the "at least one ≥3" condition, and print candidates as we go.

Note: Since the problem seeks the least such n, we'll generate all combinations within bounds, analyze their sums, and pick the minimal n.

```python
import itertools

# Constraints
max_0 = 13
max_1 = 5
max_2 = 1
max_3 = 9

min_total = None
answer_candidates = []

# Enumerate all feasible combinations
for count_0 in range(max_0 + 1):
    for count_1 in range(max_1 + 1):
        for count_2 in range(max_2 + 1):
            for count_3 in range(max_3 + 1):
                total = count_0 + count_1 + count_2 + count_3
                # Check if at least one count >= 3
                if (count_0 >= 3 or count_1 >= 3 or count_2 >= 3 or count_3 >= 3):
                    # Record the total as a candidate
                    answer_candidates.append(total)
                    print(f"Candidate total: {total} with counts (0:{count_0}, 1:{count_1}, 2:{count_2}, 3:{count_3})")
                    # Track minimal total
                    if (min_total is None) or (total < min_total):
                        min_total = total

# After enumeration, output minimal n
print(f"Minimal total n satisfying conditions: {min_total}")
```
