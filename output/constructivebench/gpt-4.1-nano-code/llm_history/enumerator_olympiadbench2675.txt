[write_program]
This problem involves a recursive sequence defined by \(a_{n+1} = \lceil \sqrt{a_n^2 + 34} \rceil\), starting with \(a_1=1\). We want to find the least \(n\) such that \(a_n > 500\) (since \(T=5\) and \(100 \times T = 500\)). I will implement a program to simulate the sequence until it exceeds 500, recording each step, and then output the minimal such \(n\).

```python
# This program computes the sequence defined by a_{n+1} = ceil(sqrt(a_n^2 + 34))
# Starting with a_1=1, find the smallest n such that a_n > 500

import math

a = 1
n = 1
threshold = 500
# Generate sequence until a_n exceeds 500
while a <= threshold:
    print(f"n={n}, a_n={a}")
    a = math.ceil(math.sqrt(a**2 + 34))
    n += 1
# Output the first n where a_n > 500
print(f"Answer: n={n - 1}")
```
