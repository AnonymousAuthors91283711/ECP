20. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Because n = 7 (odd), 9 * n, n + 8, n^2, and n * (n - 2) all are odd, indicating omnimath3490_answer n must be even but not divisible by 2, 3, or 4, which simplifies to the smallest even number satisfying that constraint.

The only consistent conclusion under these constraints is that omnimath3490_answer n = 0 when n=7, based on the enumeration pattern.
