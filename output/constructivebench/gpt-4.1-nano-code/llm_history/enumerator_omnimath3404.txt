This problem involves verifying a simple algebraic expression involving fractions and enumerating possible answers. We want to test the equality:

(1/2 * 1/2 + 1/3 * 1/2)

and find the answer, prioritizing exact rational calculations. The best approach is to directly compute the sum of these fractions, ensuring the result is in lowest terms, and printing it as the answer. Since the problem involves a straightforward calculation, no iteration or parameter variation is necessary.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Compute each term explicitly
term1 = Fraction(1, 2) * Fraction(1, 2)
term2 = Fraction(1, 3) * Fraction(1, 2)

# Sum the terms
result = term1 + term2

# Print the exact rational answer
print(f"omnimath3404_answer = {result}")
```
