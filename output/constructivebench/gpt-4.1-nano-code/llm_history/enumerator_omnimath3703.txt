This problem involves finding all real numbers \(a\) for which there exists a function \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying the inequality for all real \(x, y\):
\[ x + a f y \le y + f (f x). \]

To explore possible \(a\), I'll consider specific simple functions \(f\), such as constant functions, linear functions, and identity, to find constraints on \(a\). I'll systematically check these candidate functions and their resulting inequalities to enumerate all potential \(a\).

Here's a Python program that tries simple candidate functions and prints all \(a\) satisfying the inequality with those functions. Given the complexity, this approach should help conjecture the set of solutions.

```python
import math

# Candidate functions to test
def constant_f(c):
    return lambda x: c

def linear_f(m, b):
    return lambda x: m * x + b

def identity_f(x):
    return x

# Collect candidate a values
answers = set()

# Test constant functions f(y) = c
for c in [-10, 0, 10]:
    # Inequality reduces to: x + a*c ≤ y + f(f x)
    # For constant f, f(f x) = c
    # So: x + a c ≤ y + c for all x, y
    # Rearrange: x + a c - c ≤ y
    # For inequality to hold for all y, need: x + (a c - c) ≤ y for all y -> infinitely many y satisfy y ≥ x + (a c - c)
    # So, always possible. But to satisfy the actual inequality, no extra restrictions on a.
    # However, the key is that the inequality requires to hold for all x, y.
    # Since the inequality simplifies to: x + a c ≤ y + c, which is always true if and only if x + a c ≤ y + c for all x, y.
    # Since y is arbitrary, for fixed x:
    # For the inequality to hold for all y, x + a c ≤ y + c must be true for all y, so y ≥ x + (a c - c).
    # For all y, this is only possible if the right side is unbounded below, which it is.
    # So the inequality reduces to a trivial inequality always true. Therefore, c is any value, and a is unrestricted when f is constant.
    # But check if this aligns with the original problem: yes, constant functions always satisfy the inequality for any a.

# Test linear functions f(y) = m y + b
# We check some simple m values
for m in [-1, 0, 1]:
    # For simplicity, pick b=0
    def f(y): return m * y
    # Inequality: x + a f(y) ≤ y + f(f x)
    # Compute f(y) and f(f x):
    # f(y) = m y
    # f(f x) = f(m x) = m * (m x) = m^2 x
    # Condition: x + a (m y) ≤ y + m^2 x for all x, y
    # Rearrange: x + a m y ≤ y + m^2 x
    # Rewrite as: x - m^2 x ≤ y - a m y
    # x (1 - m^2) ≤ y (1 - a m)
    # For inequality to hold for all x, y, the ratio (1 - m^2)/(1 - a m) must satisfy certain sign conditions.
    # Let's choose specific (x, y) to find constraints:
    # For y = x:
    # x (1 - m^2) ≤ x (1 - a m) → (1 - m^2) ≤ (1 - a m)
    # Simplify:
    # 1 - m^2 ≤ 1 - a m → -m^2 ≤ - a m → a m ≤ m^2
    # Depending on m, find a:
    if m != 0:
        for a in [-10, 10]:
            if a * m <= m ** 2:
                answers.add(a)
    else:
        # m=0, f(y)=0, then inequality: x + 0 ≤ y + 0 → x ≤ y, which cannot hold for all x,y
        # So discard
        pass

# Try identity function f(x) = x
# Inequality: x + a x ≤ y + f(f x) = y + f( x ) = y + x
# Simplify: x + a x ≤ y + x → (1 + a) x ≤ y
# For all x, y, this holds iff (1 + a) x ≤ y for all x,y, which is only possible if (1 + a) x is bounded above or below.
# For the inequality to hold for all x, y, the only possibility is (1 + a) x ≤ y for all x, y.
# Since y is arbitrary, the only way is if (1 + a) x ≤ y for all x,y, which is impossible unless (1 + a) = 0, so no restriction otherwise.
# Set (1 + a) = 0 → a = -1.
answers.add(-1)
