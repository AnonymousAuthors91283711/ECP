[write_program]
The sum of binomial coefficients \(\sum_{i=0}^{10} \binom{10}{i}\) is a well-known identity equal to \(2^{10}\). To assist in conjecturing and confirming the answer, I'll write a Python program that enumerates the values of \(\binom{10}{i}\) for \(i=0\) to \(10\), sums them, and verifies the total.

The program will print each binomial coefficient as it computes, then display the total sum. It will do this with small sample parameters (\(n=10\)) to aid in reasoning.

```python
import math

# Set n=10, as per the problem
n = 10

# Enumerate binomial coefficients and sum
total_sum = 0
for i in range(n + 1):
    binom = math.comb(n, i)
    print(f"binom({n},{i}) = {binom}")
    total_sum += binom

# Output the total sum
print(f"Sum of binom({n}, i) for i=0..{n} = {total_sum}")
```

This code:
- Uses math.comb for binomial coefficient calculation.
- Prints each \(\binom{10}{i}\) for \(i=0\) to \(10\).
- Prints the total sum, which should be \(2^{10} = 1024\).
