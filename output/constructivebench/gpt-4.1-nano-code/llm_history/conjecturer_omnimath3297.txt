The properties describe divisibility of integers in specific intervals by primes within certain bounds. The first part states no such interval of length 13 fully covered by numbers divisible by primes in 2..11, which fails because small primes divide many numbers in large intervals. The second part asserts existence of an interval of length 20 entirely divisible by primes in 2..13.

Given the pattern, the minimal starting point for the second interval exists, and the first impossible interval occurs for the first part. Thus, the final answer reflects the absence of both properties.

<<<(False, False)>>>
