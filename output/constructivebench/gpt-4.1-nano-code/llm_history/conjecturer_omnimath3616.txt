theorem omnimath3616 : 
  omnimath3616_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solution: x=0, y=10
Solution: x=1, y=9
Solution: x=2, y=8
Solution: x=3, y=7
Solution: x=4, y=6
Solution: x=5, y=5
Solution: x=6, y=4
Solution: x=7, y=3
Solution: x=8, y=2
Solution: x=9, y=1
Solution: x=10, y=0. Expected Answer Type: Prop
The pattern shows solutions where x + y = 10 with 0 ≤ x ≤ 10. Thus, the solutions are all pairs satisfying x + y = 10, with both x, y ∈ ℕ, 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10. The propositional statement that captures all solutions can be expressed as:

<<<∃ x y : ℕ, (x + y = 10) ∧ (x ≤ 10) ∧ (y ≤ 10)>>>
