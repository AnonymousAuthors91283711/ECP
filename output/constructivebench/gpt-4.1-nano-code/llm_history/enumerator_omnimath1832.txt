This problem involves analyzing roots of a quartic polynomial related to nested radicals, with constraints on integers \(a, b, c, k\) and properties such as non-squareness of \(c\). To approach this, we'll fix small values for parameters, especially \(k\), and enumerate possible values of \(a, b, c\). Since the polynomial involves \(\sqrt{c}\), and the sum involving radicals, a good starting point is to consider small \(k\) (like \(k=1\)) and small positive integers for \(a, b, c\). We also want to identify \(c\) that aren't perfect squares, and find possible roots.

The main goal: find \(a, b, c, k\) satisfying the conditions, where the root \((a + \sqrt{b + \sqrt c})\) solves the quartic polynomial \(X^4 - 20 X^3 + 108 X^2 - k X + 9 = 0\).

Here's the strategy:
- Fix \(k=1\) (smallest positive).
- Enumerate small \(a, b, c\), ensuring \(c\) is not a perfect square.
- Compute the root candidate \((a + \sqrt{b + \sqrt c})\).
- Check if this value solves the polynomial.
- If yes, print it.

This approach prioritizes exact checking of the root (since the polynomial's coefficients are simple), and is efficient with small enumeration.

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    root = int(math.isqrt(n))
    return root * root == n

# Fix k=1 for simplicity in enumeration
k = 1
print(f"Using k={k}")

# Search ranges for a, b, c
for a in range(1, 20):
    for b in range(1, 20):
        for c in range(2, 20):  # start from 2 to avoid trivial squares
            if is_perfect_square(c):
                continue  # skip perfect squares
            inner_sqrt = math.sqrt(c)
            candidate = a + math.sqrt(b + inner_sqrt)
            # Approximate evaluation of the polynomial at candidate
            X = candidate
            val = X**4 - 20*X**3 + 108*X**2 - k*X + 9
            # Check if val is close to zero
            if abs(val) < 1e-6:
                print(f"Found candidate: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, root={candidate}")
                # If desired, could check for exact roots or output more info
```
