Testing potential s for (sqrt(2)+3)^n * s:
. Expected Answer Type: Bool × Bool
Let's analyze: For those sequences, the key is whether s can "annihilate" the distance to the nearest integer as n→∞ separately for each base. 
From the pattern, the first tends to zero for some nonzero s, while the second does not, reflecting different Diophantine approximation properties.
Final observation suggests the answer encapsulates these behaviors: the first true, the second false.
Therefore, the expression in Booleans represents this.

<<<(true, false)>>>
