This problem involves identifying prime numbers p, q, r, s and positive integers a, b, c such that the expression (p + q + r + s) * (a + b + c) equals an unknown answer. To assist in conjecturing, we will generate small prime combinations for p, q, r, s and small positive sums for a, b, c. Then, we'll compute the possible values of the product and output each candidate when it is encountered, prioritizing smaller sums for simplicity.

```python
import itertools

# Generate small primes up to a certain limit for manageable computation
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

primes = [n for n in range(2, 30) if is_prime(n)]  # small prime list

# Generate all combinations of four primes (allow repetitions)
prime_combinations = set(itertools.combinations_with_replacement(primes, 4))

# Generate small positive integers for a, b, c
positive_integers = range(1, 10)

# Enumerate possible sums for p+q+r+s
for primes_tuple in prime_combinations:
    p_sum = sum(primes_tuple)
    # For each possible sum of a, b, c
    for a in positive_integers:
        for b in positive_integers:
            for c in positive_integers:
                total_sum = p_sum + a + b + c
                product = total_sum * (a + b + c)
                # Output the candidate solution
                print(f'p: {primes_tuple}, a: {a}, b: {b}, c: {c}, answer: {product}')
```
