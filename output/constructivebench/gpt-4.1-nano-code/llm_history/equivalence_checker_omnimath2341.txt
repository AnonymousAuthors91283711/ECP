Ground Truth Answer: 14
Proposed Answer: 6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the maximum number of white squares (k) that can be placed on an 8x8 chessboard such that:
   - There are 6 black squares placed first
   - Every white square shares either a row or column with every black square
   - All black squares are in distinct rows and columns (no two share a row or column)
   - All white squares are in distinct rows and columns (no two share a row or column)

2. The ground truth answer is 14, which is correct because:
   - The 6 black squares block 6 rows and 6 columns
   - The remaining 2 rows and 2 columns can be fully utilized (2x8 + 8x2 - 2x2 = 14)
   - This is the maximum possible configuration

3. The proposed answer is 6, which is incorrect because:
   - It severely underestimates the possible white squares
   - It doesn't account for the fact that white squares can share multiple blocked rows/columns
   - The correct maximum is much higher (14)
