The problem provides a set of equations involving integers \(a, b, c\):

1. \(a + 5 = b\)
2. \(5 + b = c\)
3. \(b + c = a\)

We are asked to find the value of \(b\). Let's analyze these equations:

- From (1): \(b = a + 5\).
- From (2): \(c = 5 + b = 5 + a + 5 = a + 10\).
- Substitute into (3): \(b + c = a\)

Using substitutions:

\[
(a + 5) + (a + 10) = a \\
2a + 15 = a \\
a = -15
\]

Now, substitute \(a = -15\):

\[
b = a + 5 = -15 + 5 = -10 \\
c = a + 10 = -15 + 10 = -5
\]

The value of \(b\) is \(-10\).

Here's the Python code to verify and output this solution:

```python
# Equations:
# a + 5 = b
# 5 + b = c
# b + c = a

# Calculate a
for a in range(-50, 50):  # search within a range for safety
    b = a + 5
    c = 5 + b
    if b + c == a:
        print(f"a = {a}")
        print(f"b = {b}")
        print(f"c = {c}")
        # We only need to output b, so break after first solution
        break
```
