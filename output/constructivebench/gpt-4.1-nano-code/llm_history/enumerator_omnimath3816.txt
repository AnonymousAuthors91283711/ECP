The problem describes a functional equation involving a function f : ℝ → ℝ satisfying:  
(f x + f z) * (f y + f t) = f (x * y - z * t) + f (x * t + y * z)  
for all real numbers x, y, z, t.  

To assist in conjecturing potential solutions, I'll explore possible simple functions like constants, linear functions, and quadratic functions, testing their validity systematically by substituting representative values. Since the problem involves a symmetric and polynomial-like structure, starting with linear functions is reasonable, but I will also check constant functions for completeness.

The code will generate candidate functions:
- Constant functions f(x) = c
- Linear functions f(x) = a * x + b

For each function, substitute simple values to verify if the equation holds.  
Because the functional equation must hold for all variables, testing particular tuples gives insight into possible solutions.  

I'll implement the enumeration and verification for these candidate functions, print solutions as discovered, and stop after examining basic forms.
