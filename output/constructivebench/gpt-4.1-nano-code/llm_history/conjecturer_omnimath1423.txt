Total sum: 2393. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The expression sum_{k=1}^{2009} k * (floor (2009 / k) - floor (2008 / k)) counts the contribution of each k where floor divides change at 2008, i.e., divisors of 2008. The sum of these divisors is the sum of all divisors of 2008. 

Divisors of 2008 sum up to 2393 from enumerations and logic of divisor sums.
