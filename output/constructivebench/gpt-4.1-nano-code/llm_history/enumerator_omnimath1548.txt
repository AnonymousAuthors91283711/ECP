The problem asks for the greatest number `p.1` less than `p.2` (= 43), such that:
- Neither `p.1` nor `p.2` can be expressed as `19x + 9y + 8z`.
- Every number greater than `p.2` can be expressed as `19x + 9y + 8z`.

Given the structure, the key is to find the largest `p.1` under 43 that cannot be expressed in the form `19x + 9y + 8z`, with `p.2 = 43`.

Approach:
- Enumerate all values from 0 up to 43.
- For each value, check if it can be expressed as `19x + 9y + 8z`.
- Find the largest such `p.1` less than 43 which cannot be expressed this way.
- Verify that all numbers greater than 43 can be expressed, which we assume based on known properties of such linear combinations.

Since the task involves only checking small values and the computations are straightforward, this can be done efficiently.

```python
# Enumerate all numbers up to 43
def can_express(n):
    # Check if n can be expressed as 19x + 9y + 8z with nonnegative integers
    for x in range(n // 19 + 1):
        for y in range((n - 19*x) // 9 + 1):
            z = n - 19*x - 9*y
            if z >= 0 and 8*z == n - 19*x - 9*y:
                # Confirm if z is integral (since we subtracted, it should be)
                if 8*z == n - 19*x - 9*y:
                    return True
    return False

# Set boundary
p2 = 43
max_unexpressible_below_p2 = -1

for num in range(p2):
    if not can_express(num):
        max_unexpressible_below_p2 = num
        print(f"Unexpressible number below {p2}: {num}")

# The greatest unexpressible number less than 43
p1 = max_unexpressible_below_p2
print(f"Selected p.1: {p1}")
print(f"p.2: {p2}")
print(f"Product: {p1 * p2}")
```
