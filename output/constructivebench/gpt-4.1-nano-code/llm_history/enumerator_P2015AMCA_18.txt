This problem appears to involve analyzing quadratic polynomials of the form \( X^2 - aX + 2a \) over the integers, focusing on their roots, and identifying all values of \( a \) for which the polynomial has either two distinct roots (which are integers) or a repeated root (with the root also an integer). The goal is to compute the sum of all such \( a \) that satisfy these conditions.

Here's a step-by-step reasoning:

- For the quadratic \( X^2 - aX + 2a \):

  The discriminant is \(\Delta = a^2 - 8a\).

- Roots are integers if and only if \(\Delta\) is a perfect square, say \( d^2 \), and the roots are integers as well.

- The roots are:

  \[
  m, n = \frac{a \pm d}{2}
  \]

- Conditions:

  1. When roots are distinct:

     \[
     d^2 = a^2 - 8a, \quad d \in \mathbb{Z}
     \]
     and roots are \( (a \pm d)/2 \) which should be integers, so \( a \pm d \) are even.

  2. When roots are equal:

     \[
     \Delta = 0 \Rightarrow a^2 - 8a = 0 \Rightarrow a(a - 8) = 0 \Rightarrow a = 0 \text{ or } 8
     \]

Given that, I will enumerate plausible values of \( a \) within a small range, check whether discriminant is a perfect square, roots are integers, and accordingly sum the qualifying \( a \).

---

```python
# Enumerate small integer values of a within a reasonable range to find all qualifying solutions
# The quadratic is X^2 - aX + 2a
# For each a, check if discriminant is a perfect square
# Roots are integers if (a ± d) are even
# Collect all such a's and sum them

def perfect_square(n):
    root = int(n**0.5)
    return root*root == n

answers = set()
limit = 20  # choosing small limits for enumeration

for a in range(-limit, limit + 1):
    delta = a*a - 8*a
    if delta < 0:
        continue
    if perfect_square(delta):
        d = int(delta**0.5)
        # Check if roots are integers: (a ± d)/2 should be integers
        if (a + d) % 2 == 0 and (a - d) % 2 == 0:
            # Roots are integers
            answers.add(a)

total_sum = sum(answers)
# Print each answer immediately
for a in sorted(answers):
    print(a)
print("Sum of all such a:", total_sum)
```
