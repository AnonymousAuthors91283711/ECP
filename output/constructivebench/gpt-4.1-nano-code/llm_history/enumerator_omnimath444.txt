This problem involves understanding a formula involving four non-negative integers \(m, c, f, e\) summing to 1000, and the computation of a value \(D\) based on those integers. The core challenge is to examine all possible quadruples \((m,c,f,e)\) satisfying \(m + c + f + e = 1000\), compute \(D\), and explore its possible values to conjecture or prove properties such as minimum, maximum, or the set of achievable \(D\).

To efficiently do this without hardcoding, we will:

- Fix small sample values for parameters (for example, iterating over plausible small values systematically).
- For each combination, compute \(D\).
- Immediately print each computed \(D\) as a potential answer.
- Keep the enumeration manageable within token limits by limiting the ranges or leveraging constraints.

Here's a Python script that:

- Enumerates some small values for the variables \(m, c, f, e\) where their sum is 1000.
- For each, computes \(D\) according to the given formula.
- Prints each \(D\) as soon as it is computed for partial streaming.
- Can be extended or modified for more exhaustive search if needed.

Note: Since the original formula involves divisions, we will assume integer division (`//`) to reflect the integer nature of the variables and avoid floating point inaccuracies.

```python
# Enumerate quadruples (m, c, f, e) with small ranges where sum = 1000
# To keep computation manageable, we limit m, c, f, e to small ranges and check for sum=1000
# For demonstration, we'll iterate over some plausible small values

for m in range(0, 1001, 250):  # step to reduce complexity
    for c in range(0, 1001 - m, 250):
        for f in range(0, 1001 - m - c, 250):
            e = 1000 - m - c - f
            if e < 0:
                continue
            # Compute D with integer division
            D = (
                (m * ((c + f + e) // m) if m > 0 else 0) +
                (c * ((m + f + e) // c) if c > 0 else 0) +
                (f * ((m + c + e) // f) if f > 0 else 0) +
                (e * ((m + c + f) // e) if e > 0 else 0)
            )
            print(D)
```

This code streams values of \(D\) for various small combinations. Increasing the range or adjusting steps can explore more candidates for a conjecture or proof.
