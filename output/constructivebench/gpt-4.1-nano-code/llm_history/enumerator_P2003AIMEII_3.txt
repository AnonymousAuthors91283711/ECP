The problem appears to involve counting the number of functions `w: Fin 7 â†’ Fin 3` where certain adjacent value relations are forbidden. The set constraint says that for all `i` in `Fin 6`, the pattern `(w i, w (i+1))` must not be one of { (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0) }. In other words, these three pairs are forbidden transitions. We need to count the number of functions from `7` elements to `3` colors with these adjacency restrictions.

This is equivalent to counting sequences of length 7 over {0,1,2} where none of these specific pairs occur. We can model this as a finite-state automaton or recursive counting problem. Interestingly, these forbidden pairs form a cycle that excludes certain transitions, so the sequences are constrained.

We'll implement a recursive dynamic programming with memoization to count valid sequences, then verify the total count.

```python
# Count sequences of length n over {0,1,2} avoiding specific forbidden transitions
# forbidden pairs: (0,1), (1,2), (2,0)
# Valid transitions: 0->0, 0->2, 1->0, 1->1, 2->1, 2->2

def count_sequences(n):
    from functools import lru_cache
    
    # Allowed transitions from each digit
    transitions = {
        0: [0, 2],
        1: [0, 1],
        2: [1, 2]
    }

    @lru_cache(None)
    def dp(pos, last):
        if pos == n:
            return 1
        total = 0
        for next_digit in transitions[last]:
            total += dp(pos + 1, next_digit)
        return total

    total_count = 0
    # Start with each possible initial digit
    for start in range(3):
        total_count += dp(1, start)
    return total_count

result = count_sequences(7)
print(result)
```
