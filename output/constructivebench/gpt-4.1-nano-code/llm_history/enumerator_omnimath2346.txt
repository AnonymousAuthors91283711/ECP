The problem appears to involve probabilistic or combinatorial reasoning over the power set of an 8-element set. Specifically, it involves constructing the collection of all nonempty subsets of a universe of size 8 (powerset minus the empty set), then calculating the expected size of a subset chosen uniformly at random from this collection.

To enumerate possible answers, we'll:
- Generate all subsets of an 8-element set (excluding the empty set).
- Compute the sum of their sizes.
- Calculate the average size over all such subsets.
- Output this average, which should be a rational number.

Since the set has size 8, the total number of nonempty subsets is 2^8 - 1 = 255. This is manageable for enumeration.

```python
# Generate all subsets of an 8-element universe except the empty set
from itertools import combinations

# Define universe of size 8
universe = list(range(8))
sum_sizes = 0
count = 0

# Iterate over subset sizes from 1 to 8 inclusive
for r in range(1, 9):
    for subset in combinations(universe, r):
        sum_sizes += len(subset)
        count += 1
        # Print each subset size (answer stream)
        print(f"Subset size: {len(subset)}")

# Compute the expected size as a rational number
expected_size = sum_sizes / count
print(f"Expected subset size: {expected_size}")

# For the LaTeX or symbolic proof, the exact answer (as a rational) is sum_sizes / count
```
