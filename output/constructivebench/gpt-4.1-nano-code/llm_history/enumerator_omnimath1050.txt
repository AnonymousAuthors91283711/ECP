The problem involves finding the remainder when a polynomial P is divided by the polynomial \(X^3 - 6X^2 + 11X - 6\), given certain evaluations of P at specific points. Notice that \(X^3 - 6X^2 + 11X - 6\) factors as \((X - 1)(X - 2)(X - 3)\). Because P's evaluation at 1, 2, and 3 is known, and these roots relate to the divisor polynomial, the remainder must be a polynomial of degree less than 3, i.e., quadratic or lower.

The remainder when dividing by a degree 3 polynomial is a quadratic polynomial \(aX^2 + bX + c\). To find \(a, b, c\), we set:
\[ R(X) = aX^2 + bX + c \]
and enforce that:
\[ P(X) \equiv R(X) \pmod{X^3 - 6X^2 + 11X - 6} \]

Given the evaluation points, \(P(1) = -4\), \(P(2) = -1\), \(P(3) = 4\), and that the polynomial is in the same residue class modulo \(X^3 - 6X^2 + 11X - 6\), the remainders at these points satisfy:
\[ R(1) = -4 \]
\[ R(2) = -1 \]
\[ R(3) = 4 \]

We can set up the system:
\[
\begin{cases}
a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = -4 \\
a(2)^2 + b(2) + c = -1 \\
a(3)^2 + b(3) + c = 4
\end{cases}
\]

which simplifies to:
\[
\begin{cases}
a + b + c = -4 \quad (1) \\
4a + 2b + c = -1 \quad (2) \\
9a + 3b + c = 4 \quad (3)
\end{cases}
\]

Solve for \(a, b, c\) systematically and verify the solutions. Since the problem asks to generate potential answers in code, I'll implement the logic to find all solutions satisfying these equations.

Here's the code to compute and print the solutions for the remainder polynomial.

```python
# Enumerate solutions for the quadratic remainder polynomial R(X) = aX^2 + bX + c
# Given the evaluations at points 1, 2, 3:
# R(1) = -4
# R(2) = -1
# R(3) = 4

# Set up the coefficients
# Equations:
# a + b + c = -4
# 4a + 2b + c = -1
# 9a + 3b + c = 4

# To find solutions, iterate over integer candidates within a reasonable range.
# Since the evaluations are integers, solutions for a, b, c are likely integers or rational.

solutions = []

# Define search range, e.g., from -10 to 10, as a starting guess
for a in range(-10, 11):
    for b in range(-10, 11):
        # Compute c from equation (1): c = -4 - a - b
        c = -4 - a - b
        # Verify the remaining equations
        if 4*a + 2*b + c == -1 and 9*a + 3*b + c == 4:
            solutions.append((a, b, c))
            # Print each valid solution immediately
            print(f"Found possible remainder: {a}*X^2 + {b}*X + {c}")

# If multiple solutions exist, they are all printed as they are found.
# The solutions are candidates for the remainder polynomial.
```
