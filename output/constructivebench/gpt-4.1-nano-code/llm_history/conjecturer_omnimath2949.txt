. Enumerated answers: x=-9, y=-17, x - y=8
x=-7, y=-9, x - y=2
x=-5, y=-3, x - y=-2
x=-3, y=1, x - y=-4
x=-1, y=3, x - y=-4
x=1, y=3, x - y=-2
x=3, y=1, x - y=2
x=5, y=-3, x - y=8
x=7, y=-9, x - y=16
x=9, y=-17, x - y=26. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The pattern suggests that x-y takes values 8, 2, -2, -4, -4, -2, 2, 8, 16, 26, which are values obtained by shifting x starting from -9, increasing by 2 up to 9. The maximum difference 26 occurs at x=9, y=-17. Therefore, the answer is the maximum x−y value among the solutions:

<<<26>>>
