The problem involves finding integers a, b, c and a polynomial f(x) = x^4 + a x^2 + b x + c such that 2, -3, and 5 are roots of f, and the sum a + b + c is an integer answer we want to determine through enumeration.

Given the roots, we can form the polynomial as:  
f(x) = (x - 2)(x + 3)(x - 5) * (x + d), for some integer d, or more simply, since these roots are fixed, express f(x) as:  
f(x) = (x - 2)(x + 3)(x - 5)(x + e) for some integer e, but since it's degree 4 with specific roots, we can express f as  
f(x) = (x - 2)(x + 3)(x - 5)(x + d) or use the known roots approach directly.

The roots are 2, -3, 5, and since the polynomial is degree 4, the roots are these three plus a fourth root r that is unknown:

f(x) = (x - 2)(x + 3)(x - 5)(x - r)

Expanding this polynomial will give us coefficients in terms of r. We can then match it to the form:  
f(x) = x^4 + a x^2 + b x + c

by comparing coefficients, so the task reduces to iterating over small integer candidates for r and computing the sum a + b + c for each, and printing each possible solution.

```python
# Enumerate possible fourth roots r in a small range
# For each r, expand the polynomial with known roots, then match coefficients
# and compute a + b + c.

from sympy import symbols, expand, Poly

x = symbols('x')

for r in range(-10, 11):
    # Construct the polynomial with roots 2, -3, 5, r
    f = (x - 2)*(x + 3)*(x - 5)*(x - r)
    # Expand to get coefficients
    poly_expanded = expand(f)
    coeffs = Poly(poly_expanded, x).all_coeffs()
    # The polynomial is x^4 + a x^2 + b x + c
    # Coeffs order: [1, a3, a2, a1, c], but since degree 4, coeffs list: [a0, a1, a2, a3, a4]
    # sympy's all_coeffs() returns highest degree first: [a4, a3, a2, a1, a0]
    # So:
    a4, a3, a2, a1, a0 = coeffs
    # The polynomial form:
    # f(x) = x^4 + a3 x^3 + a2 x^2 + a1 x + a0
    # need to match to form: x^4 + a x^2 + b x + c
    # Note that here a3 is the x^3 coefficient, which should be zero in the form. So, check if a3 == 0
    
    if a3 == 0:
        a = a2
        b = a1
        c = a0
        result = a + b + c
        print(f"Root r = {r}, a = {a}, b = {b}, c = {c}, sum a+b+c = {result}")
```
