theorem olympiadbench2781 :
  let T := 7/8
  let m := 7
  let n := 8
  let roots := {x : ℚ | x^2 + (m + n) * x + m * n = 0}
  IsLeast (roots \ {-n}) olympiadbench2781_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: -7.0. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The given quadratic is \( x^2 + 15x + 56 = 0 \). Its roots are \( -7 \) and \( -8 \). Since the set of roots is \(\{-7, -8\}\), removing \(-8\) leaves \(\{-7\}\).

The least among the roots excluding \(-8\) is \(-7\). 

Answer in Lean:

<<<-7>>>
