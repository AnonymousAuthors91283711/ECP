<<<fun n : ℕ => ∀ k : ℕ, f (n * rad n) = f n * k where k ∈ set.range (λ m, m * rad n)>>>

This describes functions where f(n) scales multiplicatively with the radical of n, matching the pattern in enumerations suggesting a multiplicative form related to divisors of n.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The current proposed answer in Lean has a syntax error because it attempts to use the '∈' token within a function expression, which is invalid. To correct this, we should formulate the set definition as a set of functions (ℕ → ℕ) satisfying the property, rather than defining a function that embeds an '∈' statement inside.

The problem involves characterizing functions \(f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) such that for all \(n\), the radical of \(f(n)\) divides the radical of \(f(n \cdot \operatorname{rad} n)\), and \(f(n) \ge 0\). The equivalence states that such functions precisely form the set `IMO2012SLN5_answer`.

From the enumerated answers, we observe functions of the form \(f(n) = n^k \cdot c\), where \(c\) is a constant, satisfying the property. Given the divisibility condition, the general candidate is a constant function or functions that scale \(n\) by some power, since \(f(n)\) depends combinatorially on \(n\) and \(\operatorname{rad} n\).

The key idea to express this in Lean is to define the set as {f | ∀ n, ∃ k : ℕ, f(n * rad n) = f(n) * k}, which directly captures the property that \(f(n \cdot \operatorname{rad} n)\) is a multiple of \(f(n)\).

Here's the fixed expression:

<<<
fun f : ℕ → ℕ => ∀ n, ∃ k : ℕ, f (n * rad n) = f n * k
>>>

This definition avoids the syntax error and correctly characterizes functions based on the divisibility property, matching the structure suggested by the enumerated answers.
