Based on the pattern from enumerated solutions, where (x,y) yields lhs equals rhs as 1 or 7, and the symmetry in solutions for (7,13) and (13,7), the general form involves x and y being positive integers with the expression equaling a constant. The solutions suggest that the expression simplifies to |x - y| + 1, which aligns with the given y and x values, especially when x=y=1 or x,y being (7,13) or (13,7), giving 7 as the value.

Since the expression's right side is |x - y| + 1, the condition for the equality depends on the expression involving x and y, and the specific solutions suggest this is true precisely when the quadratic form simplifies accordingly.

Final answer:

<<<(x = y) ∨ (x = 7 ∧ y = 13) ∨ (x = 13 ∧ y = 7)>>>

which captures the enumerated solutions and generalizes to the given specific pairs while respecting the form of the expression.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The errors are caused because in Lean, identifiers like x and y must be properly scoped within a lambda abstraction or a theorem statement to be recognized as variables. Since the proposed answer is defined at the top level, we need to define it as a lambda function that explicitly takes x and y as arguments. Also, the notation should include parentheses to clarify the scope of each disjunction.

Furthermore, AI enumerations suggest that the key solutions are when x = y (likely a trivial solution), and when (x,y) = (7,13) or (13,7), matching the pattern found in the enumerated solutions. We will generalize this answer, but in this case, the candidate solutions seem fixed.

Thus, the fixed version should be a lambda function taking x and y as arguments, returning the disjunction of the specified cases.

Here's the corrected answer:

<<<fun x y => (x = y) ∨ (x = 7 ∧ y = 13) ∨ (x = 13 ∧ y = 7)>>>

This way, the variables x and y are correctly recognized as parameters, enabling the expression to compile.

**Summary:**  
- Wrap the answer in a lambda abstraction `fun x y => ...`  
- Use parentheses to clearly associate disjunctions and conjunctions.  
- Match the enumerated solutions: (x=y), (x=7, y=13), (x=13, y=7).  
- The fixed answer is a closed formula parameterized over x and y, compatible with the Prop type and the theorem's statement.
