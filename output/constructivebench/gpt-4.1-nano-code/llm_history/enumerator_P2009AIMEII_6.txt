The problem involves counting the number of 5-element subsets of a 14-element set where there's at least one pair of elements differing by 1. To assist in forming a conjecture, we'll enumerate all such subsets by generating all 5-element subsets and checking the adjacency condition, then count and display the total number.

Since the set is finite and small, we can use a brute-force enumeration of all 5-subsets and verify the condition efficiently.

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Set of elements from 0 to 13 (representing Fin 14)
elements = list(range(14))

count = 0
# Enumerate all 5-element subsets
for subset in combinations(elements, 5):
    # Check if there exists a pair with difference exactly 1
    has_adjacent = False
    for i in range(len(subset)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(subset)):
            if abs(subset[i] - subset[j]) == 1:
                has_adjacent = True
                break
        if has_adjacent:
            break
    if has_adjacent:
        print(subset)
        count += 1

print(f"Total subsets with at least one adjacent pair: {count}")
```
